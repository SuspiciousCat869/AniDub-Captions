WEBVTT

00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:03.533
(cheers and applause)

00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:08.233
Yuya! Yuya!
Yuya! Yuya!

00:00:08.233 --> 00:00:11.666
I'll use Stargazer Magician
and Timegazer Magician

00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:13.666
to set the Pendulum Scale.

00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:16.466
I'm taking control
of this duel starting now!

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.666
(beeping)

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.366
Swing far, Pendulum!

00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:34.466
Carve the arc
of victory!

00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:38.066
My monster is ready

00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:40.033
to swing into action.

00:00:40.033 --> 00:00:41.800
(roaring)

00:00:46.033 --> 00:00:47.400
(cheers and applause)

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.033
(Yuya)
Everything is set now,
Odd‐Eyes.

00:00:50.033 --> 00:00:52.733
Let's give this guy
a blazing send‐off.

00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:55.333
Spiral Flame Strike!

00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:01.233
That's a wrap!

00:01:01.233 --> 00:01:04.500
(cheering)

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.933
<i>Fantastisch!</i>

00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:07.066
I can't believe Yuya

00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:09.533
became the world champion
of Action Dueling.

00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:13.000
My dream has come true!

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.500
(cheers and applause)

00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:18.766
You're the greatest,
Yuya!

00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:20.533
The best ever!

00:01:20.533 --> 00:01:22.466
Gong hasn't felt
this emotional

00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:25.066
since he won his first duel
in preschool.

00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:28.566
Your performance has
moved Gong to tears, Yuya.

00:01:28.566 --> 00:01:31.233
This one's for you, Dad.

00:01:31.233 --> 00:01:33.266
The real prize
isn't a trophy.

00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:36.866
It's knowing I wowed the crowd
just like you used to do.

00:01:43.066 --> 00:01:44.733
Dad.

00:01:44.733 --> 00:01:48.166
That duel was
pendulum‐tastic, Coach Y!

00:01:48.166 --> 00:01:49.700
Whoa!
Take it easy!

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.100
Yeah! (laughing)

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.866
I just knew you'd win.

00:01:52.866 --> 00:01:55.466
That's why I picked you
to be my duel teacher.

00:01:55.466 --> 00:01:56.966
So when is my
first lesson, coach?

00:01:56.966 --> 00:01:58.133
(groaning)
Huh? Huh? Huh?

00:01:58.133 --> 00:01:59.666
Hey! Uh...

00:01:59.666 --> 00:02:03.166
Whoaaah!

00:02:05.033 --> 00:02:05.966
(thud)
(Yuya grunting)

00:02:09.866 --> 00:02:11.266
Figures.

00:02:15.366 --> 00:02:18.500
The most awesome duel
I ever fought

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.733
and it was
all just a dream.

00:02:20.733 --> 00:02:24.066
On the other hand,
I really do have the power
to Pendulum Summon,

00:02:24.066 --> 00:02:25.800
and that's real
as can be.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.633
I may not be
the world champion,

00:02:27.633 --> 00:02:30.066
but as long as I can keep
entertaining people

00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:31.400
I'll be a winner.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.333
I do want to become
the greatest dueltainer ever,

00:02:34.333 --> 00:02:36.600
and to do that I just
got to remember

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.633
to believe in my deck
and myself.

00:02:39.633 --> 00:02:41.266
You taught me
that lesson, Dad,

00:02:41.266 --> 00:02:45.300
and I promise you it's
something I'll never forget.

That blue haired pest
Sora's even bugging me
in my dreams now.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.700
First he pops onto the scene
from out of nowhere

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.333
to floor Sylvio
and his goons,

00:03:54.333 --> 00:03:56.933
and then he announces
he's gonna become my student?

00:03:56.933 --> 00:03:58.533
(dog barking)
Hmm? Huh?

00:03:58.533 --> 00:04:00.566
(panting)

00:04:00.566 --> 00:04:02.666
En, and Core.

00:04:02.666 --> 00:04:04.033
Hi.

00:04:04.033 --> 00:04:06.266
Look at you.
When Mom first found you,

00:04:06.266 --> 00:04:08.266
you were small enough
to hold in one hand.

00:04:08.266 --> 00:04:09.733
But it looks like
you've been spending

00:04:09.733 --> 00:04:11.900
plenty of quality time
chomping and chewing

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.666
at your food bowl,
haven't you, pal?

00:04:13.666 --> 00:04:14.966
(barking)

00:04:14.966 --> 00:04:16.266
(chuckling)
(mewling)

00:04:16.266 --> 00:04:17.866
Good morning, Core.

00:04:17.866 --> 00:04:19.833
(mewling)

00:04:19.833 --> 00:04:21.266
(chuckling)

00:04:21.266 --> 00:04:23.533
(Yoko)
You certainly are hungry,
my little friend.

00:04:23.533 --> 00:04:26.200
Well, keep eating.
There's plenty more
where that came from.

00:04:28.266 --> 00:04:31.333
Did you let another stray
in the house, Mom?

00:04:31.333 --> 00:04:32.466
Yeah, me!

00:04:34.366 --> 00:04:36.700
What are you
doing here?

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.433
I noticed him wandering
around the neighborhood,
the poor boy.

00:04:40.433 --> 00:04:42.933
I had no choice but to offer
him breakfast, of course,

00:04:42.933 --> 00:04:45.100
since he looked
so hungry.

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.333
You should've
given him food to go.

00:04:47.333 --> 00:04:48.600
He's welcome here.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.333
Sora's your student,
isn't he?

00:04:50.333 --> 00:04:52.000
No!
(groans)

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.600
Well, you're not.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.666
You have had a bad
habit of turning up
when you're not wanted,

00:04:56.666 --> 00:04:58.766
which happens to be
all the time.

00:04:58.766 --> 00:04:59.866
That's rude.

00:04:59.866 --> 00:05:01.266
I can see you didn't
learn manners

00:05:01.266 --> 00:05:02.800
from your sister here.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.466
His sister?

00:05:04.466 --> 00:05:07.200
Uh, have I made
a mistake? Sorry.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.233
I figured you had
to be Coach Y's sister

00:05:09.233 --> 00:05:12.133
since you look so incredibly
young and beautiful.

00:05:15.466 --> 00:05:19.033
Oh! Well, well,
what a perceptive
young man,

00:05:19.033 --> 00:05:21.100
and completely
charming, too.

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.800
I bet
you're still hungry.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.266
Can I get you
more syrup?

00:05:24.266 --> 00:05:25.700
Those are
my pancakes!

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.400
Yes, please,
if you don't mind.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.933
(Yoko)
Why don't I make
waffles, too?

00:05:28.933 --> 00:05:31.166
(Sora)
With scrambled eggs
and French toast?

00:05:31.166 --> 00:05:32.633
(sighing)
Coming right up.

00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:35.833
Really? Sora's the kid
who wants you

00:05:35.833 --> 00:05:37.200
to teach him
how to duel, right?

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.200
And now he's hanging out
in your house?

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.233
Yeah.
It seems no matter
how hard I try,

00:05:42.233 --> 00:05:44.000
I can't get rid
of that pest.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.033
(Sora)
Coach Y!

00:05:45.033 --> 00:05:46.733
You see what I mean?

00:05:46.733 --> 00:05:48.800
Hey, are you
following me?

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.100
Yeah!

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.800
Look, just go away!

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.533
I can't, 'cause we have
to have our first lesson.

00:05:54.533 --> 00:05:57.466
I'm ready to get started
whenever you say.

00:05:57.466 --> 00:06:00.233
When are you gonna get it
into that blue haired
head of yours

00:06:00.233 --> 00:06:02.000
that I do not want to‐‐
Come on!

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.600
You've got to teach me!

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.266
When I saw you duel Sylvio

00:06:05.266 --> 00:06:07.600
I could tell you were
the greatest duelist ever,

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.200
especially after your
incredible Pendulum Summon.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.333
I want to learn how
to summon like that, too.

00:06:13.333 --> 00:06:15.900
Sorry to burst your bubble,
but you can't be

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.000
'cause you don't have
any pendulum cards.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.333
(gasps)

00:06:19.333 --> 00:06:21.366
Oh, can't you
teach me anyway?

00:06:21.366 --> 00:06:23.433
Won't you, please?

00:06:23.433 --> 00:06:25.933
I bet you he'll do it
if you ask him.

00:06:25.933 --> 00:06:27.600
Why's that, Sora?

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.566
'Cause if Coach Y's
girlfriend asks,

00:06:29.566 --> 00:06:31.100
there's no way
he can say no.

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.433
His girlfriend?

00:06:32.433 --> 00:06:33.633
Aren't you
sweethearts?

00:06:33.633 --> 00:06:35.200
(both)
Of course not!

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.400
As far as I'm concerned,
there's nothing sweet
about her, okay?

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.466
(groaning)

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.866
How dare he insinuate
I'm bad‐tempered

00:06:43.866 --> 00:06:45.066
and hard
to get along with?

00:06:45.066 --> 00:06:46.033
In all my time...

00:06:46.033 --> 00:06:48.133
I think she likes you,
Coach Y.

00:06:51.233 --> 00:06:53.500
I wonder if anybody
can Pendulum Summon

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.033
as long as they have
the right cards.

00:06:56.033 --> 00:06:59.400
Sylvio didn't seem
to have any problem
when we dueled.

00:07:11.066 --> 00:07:13.300
(Sora)
Coach Y looks worried.

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:17.066
I better find a way to turn
his frown upside down.

00:07:17.066 --> 00:07:18.866
Go Coach Y!

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.433
Hi!
(gasping)

00:07:21.433 --> 00:07:23.400
Tag! You're it!

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.866
(sighing)

00:07:24.866 --> 00:07:26.600
Hey!
(gasps)

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:29.966
(Yuya)
This kid needs to cool it
before I lose it!

00:07:32.041 --> 00:07:34.474
Sora was only trying
to cheer you up.

00:07:34.474 --> 00:07:36.807
Why are you so down
in the dumps anyway?

00:07:36.807 --> 00:07:38.307
I don't know.

00:07:38.307 --> 00:07:40.974
You don't take anything
too seriously, Yuya,

00:07:40.974 --> 00:07:44.207
so why take your
miserable mood so seriously?

00:07:44.207 --> 00:07:46.474
Hey, you know what would
really cheer you up?

00:07:46.474 --> 00:07:48.574
A duel to beat back
your blues!

00:07:48.574 --> 00:07:50.207
Maybe.

00:07:50.207 --> 00:07:52.407
I'm just not sure.

00:07:53.641 --> 00:07:54.907
Wait!

00:07:54.907 --> 00:07:56.474
You're right, Zuzu!

00:07:56.474 --> 00:07:58.141
I can't let doom and gloom
bring me down.

00:07:58.141 --> 00:08:00.574
Then let
the battle begin.

00:08:02.641 --> 00:08:04.941
All right,
who's ready to duel?

00:08:04.941 --> 00:08:07.007
The one and only
Yuya Sakaki

00:08:07.007 --> 00:08:09.841
has arrived to take
center stage.

00:08:09.841 --> 00:08:11.674
Ah, what's up,
Coach Y?

00:08:11.674 --> 00:08:12.807
(groaning)

00:08:12.807 --> 00:08:14.741
Wait, what are you
doing here?

00:08:14.741 --> 00:08:16.807
He came to meet you
for his first lesson.

00:08:16.807 --> 00:08:19.041
It's rude to keep your
students waiting, Yuya.

00:08:19.041 --> 00:08:20.641
But he's not...

00:08:20.641 --> 00:08:22.007
Aaah!

00:08:22.007 --> 00:08:24.774
Yuya, I'm proud you
chose to entertrain

00:08:24.774 --> 00:08:26.941
your first pupil here,
and I'm even prouder

00:08:26.941 --> 00:08:29.141
that he'll be enrolling
in our school.

00:08:29.141 --> 00:08:30.507
Right? No pressure.

00:08:30.507 --> 00:08:31.974
Listen to me!

00:08:31.974 --> 00:08:33.507
He's not my student.

00:08:33.507 --> 00:08:35.941
Come on, what are we
waiting for, Coach?

00:08:35.941 --> 00:08:38.641
We gotta tackle our first
dueling lesson, right?

00:08:38.641 --> 00:08:40.074
Then let's get to it.

00:08:40.074 --> 00:08:41.907
I want to learn
how to Pendulum Summon

00:08:41.907 --> 00:08:43.507
from the best
of the best!

00:08:43.507 --> 00:08:46.607
I'm counting on you to turn me
into a dualtaining whiz kid.

00:08:46.607 --> 00:08:50.941
How many times
do I have to say no
before you stop asking?

00:08:50.941 --> 00:08:53.241
Good question.

00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:55.474
Look, coach,
I'll make you a deal.

00:08:55.474 --> 00:08:59.774
Just duel me this once and
I'll never bother you again.

00:08:59.774 --> 00:09:02.407
That sounds like
a fair deal to me.

00:09:02.407 --> 00:09:04.741
You can't
turn him down, Yuya.

00:09:04.741 --> 00:09:06.374
(shuddering)

00:09:06.374 --> 00:09:07.907
Aww, come on, Yuya,

00:09:07.907 --> 00:09:09.607
it's only one
simple duel.

00:09:09.607 --> 00:09:12.041
Yuya, if you turn down
this poor kid

00:09:12.041 --> 00:09:13.907
it will bring dishonor
to the reputation

00:09:13.907 --> 00:09:15.407
of the You Show
Duel School,

00:09:15.407 --> 00:09:18.774
not to mention
we'd have to give back
his tuition money.

00:09:18.774 --> 00:09:20.841
(Sora)
Please, Coach Y?

00:09:20.841 --> 00:09:23.007
Let's duel.

00:09:23.007 --> 00:09:25.741
Pretty please?

00:09:25.741 --> 00:09:27.774
You can ask me
a million times

00:09:27.774 --> 00:09:29.374
and I'll still
tell you no.

00:09:29.374 --> 00:09:30.741
(whimpering)
Ah...

00:09:30.741 --> 00:09:32.874
Please, please, please,
please, please, please?
(sighing)

00:09:32.874 --> 00:09:34.807
Except for this
one time only.

00:09:34.807 --> 00:09:36.974
Whoo‐hoo!
But listen...

00:09:36.974 --> 00:09:38.774
You have to promise
if I win

00:09:38.774 --> 00:09:40.941
you'll stop following me
around everywhere,

00:09:40.941 --> 00:09:44.674
and you won't ask me
to teach you or
call me Coach, agreed?

00:09:44.674 --> 00:09:47.141
Mm‐hmm,
but if I win,

00:09:47.141 --> 00:09:49.941
I'll be your student
and I can call you Coach,

00:09:49.941 --> 00:09:52.707
plus I can follow you
around as much as I want.

00:09:52.707 --> 00:09:54.074
(shudders)

00:09:54.074 --> 00:09:57.274
(murmuring)

00:10:00.107 --> 00:10:02.507
(Skip) And so begins
an epic showdown

00:10:02.507 --> 00:10:04.641
between our resident
Pendulum expert

00:10:04.641 --> 00:10:06.607
<i>and his wannabe student.</i>

00:10:06.607 --> 00:10:08.941
Wow, this is
really happening!

00:10:08.941 --> 00:10:11.707
Duelists, get ready...

00:10:11.707 --> 00:10:13.407
to duel!

00:10:13.407 --> 00:10:17.441
Our cardslingers will clash
in the Wildest West.

00:10:17.441 --> 00:10:20.641
(computer voice)
Augmented reality
combat system energized.

00:10:20.641 --> 00:10:22.207
<i>Generating action field.</i>

00:10:30.574 --> 00:10:32.707
Don't you have
a cooler field?

00:10:32.707 --> 00:10:34.741
This one's
kind of weak.

00:10:34.741 --> 00:10:36.274
Huh?

00:10:36.274 --> 00:10:38.074
Use some imagination.

00:10:38.074 --> 00:10:40.941
I want to duel Yuya
somewhere sweeter than this.

00:10:40.941 --> 00:10:42.874
Uh, let me think.

00:10:42.874 --> 00:10:44.807
Okay... go!

00:10:47.907 --> 00:10:49.974
(computer voice)
<i>Generating action field.</i>

00:10:53.274 --> 00:10:55.374
Whoa. (chuckling)

00:10:55.374 --> 00:10:57.874
Ohh... yum!

00:10:57.874 --> 00:10:59.407
That's more like it!

00:10:59.407 --> 00:11:01.107
Now this field's
a treat.

00:11:01.107 --> 00:11:03.707
It's awesome!
You're the best!

00:11:03.707 --> 00:11:05.807
How cute!

00:11:05.807 --> 00:11:08.707
(sighs)
Give me a break.

00:11:08.707 --> 00:11:12.007
♪

00:11:23.141 --> 00:11:26.907
And now, get set for a duel
of delicious delights.

00:11:26.907 --> 00:11:29.841
It's teacher
against student, ha ha!

00:11:29.841 --> 00:11:32.974
This battle will have you
rolling with excitement.

00:11:32.974 --> 00:11:36.607
'Cause only one will rule
this sweet treat of a duel.

00:11:36.607 --> 00:11:38.774
The action begins...

00:11:38.774 --> 00:11:40.974
Now!
Now!

00:11:43.531 --> 00:11:46.364
(computer voice)
<i>Action cards dispersed.</i>

00:11:46.364 --> 00:11:48.164
Ready, Sora?

00:11:48.164 --> 00:11:50.264
I'll get things started
by summoning

00:11:50.264 --> 00:11:52.331
my PerformaPal
Hip Hippo.

00:11:52.331 --> 00:11:53.464
(growls)

00:11:55.297 --> 00:11:59.097
What do you say you and me
hoof it into high gear,
Hip Hippo?

00:11:59.097 --> 00:12:00.531
See you, Sora.

00:12:01.997 --> 00:12:04.864
Not if I see you first.

00:12:06.264 --> 00:12:07.897
I drew the spell
Toy Vendor

00:12:07.897 --> 00:12:10.264
and I'm gonna
activate it right now!

00:12:14.164 --> 00:12:15.797
This toy's fun‐tastic,

00:12:15.797 --> 00:12:16.964
'cause it lets me
send a card

00:12:16.964 --> 00:12:18.464
from my hand
to the graveyard,

00:12:18.464 --> 00:12:20.897
and then I can draw
another card from my deck.

00:12:20.897 --> 00:12:22.764
Uh, this card's yucky.

00:12:25.397 --> 00:12:28.531
Now if I draw a monster card
that's Level 4 or below

00:12:28.531 --> 00:12:31.464
I'm allowed to summon it,
but if it's not

00:12:31.464 --> 00:12:33.331
I'll have to toss it
into my graveyard.

00:12:34.531 --> 00:12:36.431
Look, it's Fluffal Bear.

00:12:38.531 --> 00:12:40.631
(creaking)

00:12:40.631 --> 00:12:44.064
Come on and join
the party, Fluffal Bear!

00:12:48.897 --> 00:12:51.164
And I'm inviting
your friend Fluffal Leo

00:12:51.164 --> 00:12:52.531
to join us, too.

00:12:53.697 --> 00:12:55.164
(roars)

00:12:57.297 --> 00:12:59.864
That kid may look like
he's all fun and games,

00:12:59.864 --> 00:13:01.231
but by the way he plays

00:13:01.231 --> 00:13:03.197
I can tell he's not
toying around.

00:13:03.197 --> 00:13:05.531
He sure doesn't
duel like a newbie.

00:13:05.531 --> 00:13:08.564
And I love his monsters
'cause they're so...

00:13:08.564 --> 00:13:10.497
Cuddly!
Cuddly!

00:13:10.497 --> 00:13:12.231
Cuddly?

00:13:12.231 --> 00:13:13.331
Come on!

00:13:14.997 --> 00:13:16.297
Hey, look out!

00:13:16.297 --> 00:13:17.397
Eyes front!

00:13:17.397 --> 00:13:19.397
Huh? Huh?!

00:13:19.397 --> 00:13:20.997
This is not
gonna be sweet.

00:13:20.997 --> 00:13:22.397
(roars)

00:13:23.897 --> 00:13:25.164
Oh.
(groans)

00:13:25.164 --> 00:13:27.697
(gasping, sighing)

00:13:27.697 --> 00:13:30.131
(Sora)
Get in the game, Coach!

00:13:30.131 --> 00:13:31.731
Your hippo's history,

00:13:31.731 --> 00:13:34.431
'cause my Fluffal Leo
is prepping to pounce.

00:13:34.431 --> 00:13:36.231
(roaring)

00:13:36.231 --> 00:13:37.464
Oh, no!

00:13:39.131 --> 00:13:41.297
Just kidding.
Huh?

00:13:41.297 --> 00:13:43.664
I'm gonna use the
Action Spell Evasion

00:13:43.664 --> 00:13:44.997
to tame your Leo.

00:13:44.997 --> 00:13:47.297
You see, this card
lets my hippo

00:13:47.297 --> 00:13:49.064
steer clear
of its attack.

00:13:49.064 --> 00:13:50.231
(roaring)

00:13:50.231 --> 00:13:52.297
Roll with it,
Hip Hippo.

00:13:52.297 --> 00:13:54.731
Hey! Dodging my attacks
isn't fair.

00:13:54.731 --> 00:13:55.997
You don't expect me
to just let you

00:13:55.997 --> 00:13:57.697
destroy my monster,
do you?

00:13:57.697 --> 00:13:59.397
Where did he get
an Action card?

00:13:59.397 --> 00:14:02.197
I didn't see Yuya
pick up one anyplace.

00:14:02.197 --> 00:14:03.931
Maybe you couldn't see.

00:14:03.931 --> 00:14:06.664
I bet he picked it up
when he fell in that goop.

00:14:06.664 --> 00:14:08.131
Correct!

00:14:08.131 --> 00:14:09.197
Yuya!

00:14:09.197 --> 00:14:11.164
Watch out!
Watch out!

00:14:11.164 --> 00:14:12.331
Huh?

00:14:19.864 --> 00:14:21.364
(sighing)

00:14:23.431 --> 00:14:25.231
While you were
dessert diving,

00:14:25.231 --> 00:14:26.997
my Fluffal Bear
was getting prepped

00:14:26.997 --> 00:14:29.397
to hunt down
your hippo!

00:14:29.397 --> 00:14:31.097
(growling)

00:14:31.097 --> 00:14:33.064
(Zuzu)
Another Action card?

00:14:33.064 --> 00:14:34.497
Oh, it was in the cake.

00:14:34.497 --> 00:14:36.997
If all the Action cards
are hidden inside desserts

00:14:36.997 --> 00:14:39.131
these duelists
are gonna need a diet!

00:14:39.131 --> 00:14:42.931
I'm activating
the Action Spell Candy Shower.

00:14:46.497 --> 00:14:49.431
Wow!
What a sugary surprise.

00:14:49.431 --> 00:14:50.364
Huh?

00:14:51.864 --> 00:14:53.097
(groaning)

00:14:53.097 --> 00:14:55.364
You should be attacking
Yuya's hippo, not that candy!

00:14:55.364 --> 00:14:57.764
The sweetest part about
that Action Spell

00:14:57.764 --> 00:15:00.831
is that it switched
Fluffal Bear
into defense mode.

00:15:00.831 --> 00:15:02.164
(groans)

00:15:02.164 --> 00:15:04.331
I guess I'll end
my turn, then.

00:15:04.331 --> 00:15:08.131
If you can find Action cards
then I can, too!

00:15:08.131 --> 00:15:10.064
We'll see about that.

00:15:14.297 --> 00:15:16.097
Come on, Fluffal Bear.

00:15:16.097 --> 00:15:18.264
Put your back into it!

00:15:18.264 --> 00:15:20.164
(groaning)

00:15:22.297 --> 00:15:24.331
Almost got it.

00:15:24.331 --> 00:15:26.964
(grunting)
Just a little closer.

00:15:32.664 --> 00:15:34.164
Better luck next time.

00:15:34.164 --> 00:15:35.731
Hey, that was mine!

00:15:38.797 --> 00:15:41.897
You wanted a dueling demo
and that's what you're getting.

00:15:41.897 --> 00:15:44.831
And next I'll show you
something really amazing.

00:15:44.831 --> 00:15:46.797
Huh?
You don't mean...

00:15:46.797 --> 00:15:50.397
I'll use Stargazer Magician
and Timegazer Magician

00:15:50.397 --> 00:15:52.364
to set the Pendulum Scale.

00:15:52.364 --> 00:15:55.731
I'm taking control
of this duel starting now!

00:15:58.464 --> 00:16:00.031
Here we go.

00:16:00.031 --> 00:16:01.831
He's gonna
Pendulum Summon!

00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:08.431
I'm allowed to summon
monsters from Level 2

00:16:08.431 --> 00:16:11.197
through Level 7
all at the same time!

00:16:11.197 --> 00:16:13.564
Swing far, Pendulum.

00:16:13.564 --> 00:16:16.097
Carve the arc
of victory!

00:16:17.497 --> 00:16:21.497
♪

00:16:26.797 --> 00:16:28.931
My monsters are ready...

00:16:28.931 --> 00:16:31.697
to swing into action!

00:16:34.797 --> 00:16:37.297
H‐2‐Go,
Skeeter Skimmer.

00:16:37.297 --> 00:16:40.131
Slice and dice,
Sword Fish.

00:16:40.131 --> 00:16:43.897
It's time to turn up
the heat, Odd‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon!

00:16:43.897 --> 00:16:46.064
(roaring)

00:16:49.761 --> 00:16:52.227
(roaring)

00:16:52.227 --> 00:16:53.394
Wow!

00:16:53.394 --> 00:16:55.694
That's amazing, Coach Y!

00:16:55.694 --> 00:16:58.494
Wait until you see
what I've got in store
for you next.

00:16:58.494 --> 00:17:01.661
Check out my Sword Fish's
special ability.

00:17:01.661 --> 00:17:05.227
Once per turn
my PerformaPal can zero in
on one of your monsters

00:17:05.227 --> 00:17:08.094
and then slice and dice
its attack points by 600.

00:17:13.327 --> 00:17:14.794
But I'm not done.

00:17:14.794 --> 00:17:17.561
I'll also use the Action Card
I snatched from you.

00:17:17.561 --> 00:17:19.594
It'll give you
the biggest sugar crash,

00:17:19.594 --> 00:17:23.761
'cause now my Odd‐Eyes gets
a 700‐point power boost.

00:17:26.094 --> 00:17:28.161
Yuya sure is
schooling Sora.

00:17:28.161 --> 00:17:30.227
He'swünderbar.

00:17:30.227 --> 00:17:31.561
It's on!

00:17:31.561 --> 00:17:33.127
Odd‐Eyes is primed
to take down

00:17:33.127 --> 00:17:34.561
your fragile feline.

00:17:34.561 --> 00:17:36.761
Okay,
get set to strike!

00:17:36.761 --> 00:17:40.727
Ready? It's time to
finish off that furball!

00:17:40.727 --> 00:17:43.194
Here's a lesson
you won't forget, Sora.

00:17:43.194 --> 00:17:45.161
(roaring)
Odd‐Eyes isn't
toying around.

00:17:48.494 --> 00:17:50.894
Spiral Flame Strike!

00:17:56.127 --> 00:17:57.994
Whoa!

00:18:07.027 --> 00:18:10.161
Yuya's taking this duel
to the next level.

00:18:10.161 --> 00:18:12.227
It's got me
all fired up!

00:18:12.227 --> 00:18:15.094
That sent a shiver
down my spine‐‐ huh?

00:18:15.094 --> 00:18:18.027
Hey, wait, something
isn't adding up right.

00:18:18.027 --> 00:18:20.061
I thought Odd‐Eyes
was supposed to deal

00:18:20.061 --> 00:18:21.861
double damage
to opponents.

00:18:21.861 --> 00:18:24.427
It does, but only when
the monster it's battling

00:18:24.427 --> 00:18:27.094
is Level 5 or above.
Oh, right!

00:18:27.094 --> 00:18:29.894
I got so caught up
in the excitement
of the duel

00:18:29.894 --> 00:18:33.361
I totally forgot that
that lion is only Level 4.

00:18:33.361 --> 00:18:34.894
It's no biggie.

00:18:34.894 --> 00:18:37.894
I'll hand it
back to you, Sora.

00:18:37.894 --> 00:18:40.527
Of course my Action Spell's
effect wears off now,

00:18:40.527 --> 00:18:44.161
so Odd‐Eyes' attack points
are going back to normal.

00:18:49.094 --> 00:18:51.161
Is Sora
gonna be okay?

00:18:51.161 --> 00:18:54.394
Hey, Yuya, you didn't
have to knock the poor
kid for a loop.

00:18:54.394 --> 00:18:56.594
You should go
a little easier on him.

00:18:56.594 --> 00:18:59.027
But he wanted
to duel me for real.

00:18:59.027 --> 00:19:01.127
(Sora chuckling)
Huh?

00:19:01.127 --> 00:19:02.994
(chuckling)

00:19:06.061 --> 00:19:08.561
(grunting)
Thanks, Yuya.

00:19:08.561 --> 00:19:11.727
Now that I felt the full
force of one of your
Pendulum monsters,

00:19:11.727 --> 00:19:14.294
I'm even more determined
to become your student.

00:19:14.294 --> 00:19:15.761
(groans)

00:19:15.761 --> 00:19:17.027
My draw!

00:19:19.261 --> 00:19:22.494
I think my deck is trying
to send me a message.

00:19:22.494 --> 00:19:24.461
It's telling me...

00:19:24.461 --> 00:19:27.527
that it's time
to get serious.

00:19:27.527 --> 00:19:29.161
What is that
supposed to mean?

00:19:29.161 --> 00:19:32.061
Are you saying
you haven't been
serious 'til now?

00:19:32.061 --> 00:19:35.594
(chuckles)
Maybe or maybe not.
Let's see.

00:19:35.594 --> 00:19:37.827
If I send a card
to the graveyard,

00:19:37.827 --> 00:19:40.327
I can play with my
Toy Vendor again.

00:19:40.327 --> 00:19:42.927
I can't wait to see
what card it's gonna be.

00:19:42.927 --> 00:19:44.994
Yes!

00:19:44.994 --> 00:19:46.361
Oh, cool!

00:19:46.361 --> 00:19:49.727
These Edge Imp Sabers are going
to cut Yuya down to size.

00:19:49.727 --> 00:19:51.594
(creaking)

00:19:55.294 --> 00:19:57.127
Monsters don't get
more cutting‐edge

00:19:57.127 --> 00:19:59.761
than Edge Imp Sabers.

00:19:59.761 --> 00:20:01.194
Then I'll use a spell.

00:20:01.194 --> 00:20:04.361
It's a card called
Polymeri‐something or other.

00:20:04.361 --> 00:20:07.361
You mean
Polymerization?

00:20:07.361 --> 00:20:08.527
Yeah!
This awesome spell

00:20:08.527 --> 00:20:10.594
lets me fuse together
my Edge Imp Sabers

00:20:10.594 --> 00:20:11.894
and my Fluffal Bear.

00:20:11.894 --> 00:20:15.494
Edge of sharpness
and fury of bear

00:20:15.494 --> 00:20:17.427
When the two come together,

00:20:17.427 --> 00:20:20.427
you had better beware!

00:20:20.427 --> 00:20:22.827
Fusion Summon!

00:20:22.827 --> 00:20:25.161
That was freaky,
but what did he mean?

00:20:25.161 --> 00:20:26.927
He's mixing monsters,
Frederick.

00:20:26.927 --> 00:20:29.694
That way, by combining
the two cards together

00:20:29.694 --> 00:20:31.827
they can turn into
a really powerful monster

00:20:31.827 --> 00:20:33.327
that you wouldn't want
to mess with.

00:20:36.894 --> 00:20:38.361
Here it comes,

00:20:38.361 --> 00:20:40.727
the most unbearable monster

00:20:40.727 --> 00:20:44.361
you've ever seen:
Frightfur Bear!

00:20:44.361 --> 00:20:47.994
(growling)

00:20:47.994 --> 00:20:50.094
That doesn't look
so cuddly anymore.

00:20:50.094 --> 00:20:52.127
It's so scary.

00:20:52.127 --> 00:20:53.494
It'll be okay.

00:20:53.494 --> 00:20:54.961
Awesome.

00:20:54.961 --> 00:20:56.694
Never seen
one of those before.

00:20:59.261 --> 00:21:00.494
Thanks, Coach.

00:21:00.494 --> 00:21:02.027
I learned a lot
from you today,

00:21:02.027 --> 00:21:05.294
but now it's my turn to
teach you a lesson or two.
