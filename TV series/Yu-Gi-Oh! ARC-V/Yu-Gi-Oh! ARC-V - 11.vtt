WEBVTT

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.333
(Yuya)
Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! Arc‐V"...

00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:05.966
(Allie)
Yuya won his duel...

00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:08.166
(Frederick)
...und Zuzu lost hers.

00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:10.300
(Tate)
The next duel decides it!

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.933
The name's Kit Blade

00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:14.633
and I'm the slickest Syncro
Summoner you'll ever meet.

00:00:14.633 --> 00:00:17.166
Now which one of you
do I get to beat?

00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:19.633
You know how much
this duel means, Gong.

00:00:19.633 --> 00:00:22.000
But there's nobody else
I'd want or trust more

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.866
to fight for our school
than my very best friend.

00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:26.633
Duel!

00:00:26.633 --> 00:00:30.833
Gong summons Superheavy
Samurai Kabuto from my hand.

00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:36.266
(Kit)
A weak monster with
1,000 attack points?

00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:38.233
That's your big open?
Ha!

00:00:38.233 --> 00:00:40.633
You're diggin' a hole
for yourself, big brows!

00:00:40.633 --> 00:00:42.300
You start playing cute

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.366
and things are gonna
get ugly real fast.

00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:45.366
Nice going!

00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:46.800
Now hunker down
and wear 'em out

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.533
with your Heavystrong
Dueling technique!

00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:52.833
I Synchro Summon Level 9
XX‐Saber Gottoms!

00:00:52.833 --> 00:00:55.233
(Yuya)
Gong's got his work
cut out for him,

00:00:55.233 --> 00:00:58.966
'cause Kit looks ready to slice
and dice his way to victory!

You don't stand a chance
of beating me, Gong!

00:02:05.933 --> 00:02:07.233
And when you lose,

00:02:07.233 --> 00:02:10.500
the Leo Institute's
taking over You Show!

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.500
(snickering)

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.133
I can't wait to walk around
and choose which locker I want!

00:02:16.133 --> 00:02:18.966
Maybe I'll take two,
Yuya's and Zuzu's!

00:02:18.966 --> 00:02:20.433
(laughs)

00:02:23.333 --> 00:02:26.233
This guy's really trying
to get into Gong's head.

00:02:26.233 --> 00:02:28.333
I just hope that Gong
doesn't lose his focus.

00:02:31.466 --> 00:02:32.766
What's the matter?

00:02:32.766 --> 00:02:35.266
Too shocked to say
anything, big brows?

00:02:35.266 --> 00:02:37.233
You run your mouth
if you want to.

00:02:37.233 --> 00:02:39.033
Gong doesn't
do trash talk.

00:02:39.033 --> 00:02:41.600
Gong fights his battles
with skills and monsters,

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.200
not with jawbonin'.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.166
You want skills
and monsters?

00:02:45.166 --> 00:02:46.966
I'll give you more
than you can handle,

00:02:46.966 --> 00:02:48.133
a lot more!

00:02:48.133 --> 00:02:52.433
XX‐Saber Gottoms attack
Superheavy Samurai Kabuto!

00:02:58.566 --> 00:02:59.900
Nice, huh?

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.866
My Gottoms always gets
the job done,

00:03:01.866 --> 00:03:03.666
and the next job is you!

00:03:03.666 --> 00:03:06.766
X‐Saber Souza,
attack this guy directly!

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.600
(growling)

00:03:23.633 --> 00:03:25.800
He took that attack
like it was nothing!

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.066
He's one
tough cookie!

00:03:27.066 --> 00:03:30.300
That's right!
Gong never moves when he duels.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.900
He's got me so fired up,

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.033
I might set off
the sprinkler system!

00:03:34.033 --> 00:03:35.166
(chuckles)

00:03:35.166 --> 00:03:36.666
Well, I've got something
planned for later

00:03:36.666 --> 00:03:38.033
that's sure
to cool you off!

00:03:38.033 --> 00:03:41.333
I place one card facedown
and end my turn.

00:03:41.333 --> 00:03:45.200
Alrighty, Kit.
It's Gong's move!

00:03:47.033 --> 00:03:50.933
Gong's got just what he needs
to get things gonging.

00:03:50.933 --> 00:03:53.033
Since you have
two monsters out,

00:03:53.033 --> 00:03:56.366
Gong can summon
Superheavy Samurai Scales!

00:04:03.066 --> 00:04:06.500
And when Gong's got this big
bad boy on the premises,

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.466
Gong can grab a Superheavy
Samurai from his graveyard.

00:04:10.466 --> 00:04:14.700
Welcome back,
Superheavy Samurai Kabuto!

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.600
Unfortunately, you won't be
sticking around,

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.866
'cause Gong's tributing you
and Superheavy Samurai Scales

00:04:20.866 --> 00:04:22.566
to tip things in Gong's favor.

00:04:22.566 --> 00:04:24.266
Gong's bringing out
the staff

00:04:24.266 --> 00:04:28.100
swinging Superheavy Samurai
Big Benkei in defense mode.

00:04:36.833 --> 00:04:40.266
If you ask me, that move looks
like a big waste of time!

00:04:40.266 --> 00:04:43.166
When you summon a monster
in defense mode,

00:04:43.166 --> 00:04:44.933
it's usually facedown.

00:04:44.933 --> 00:04:47.200
True, but one
of Big Benkei's powers

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.833
is that it can be summoned
face‐up in defense mode.

00:04:49.833 --> 00:04:51.166
(chuckles)

00:04:51.166 --> 00:04:53.333
If you keep making
worthless moves like that,

00:04:53.333 --> 00:04:55.500
you're never gonna save
your friends' school.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.466
(Gong)
We'll see how worthless
that move is!

00:04:58.466 --> 00:05:00.933
Big Benkei, take a swipe

00:05:00.933 --> 00:05:03.900
and knock his XX‐Saber
Gottoms into next week!

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.300
But your monster's still
in defense mode!

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.066
Yeah, but Big Benkei's
allowed to attack

00:05:08.066 --> 00:05:09.266
even when
it's in defense mode.

00:05:15.133 --> 00:05:18.433
And its defense points get
used as its attack points!

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.166
And that means...

00:05:21.166 --> 00:05:23.566
Gong's Samurai's gonna
scorch the competition!

00:05:25.733 --> 00:05:28.300
That'swunderbar!

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:32.966
(Gong)
<i>All right.</i>

00:05:32.966 --> 00:05:36.200
Gong's plan is going just
the way Gong planned it.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.200
Gong thinks that's
enough hurt for now!

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.733
I'll show you hurt.
Hiya!

00:05:42.733 --> 00:05:46.966
I summon XX‐Saber Boggart
Knight in attack mode!

00:05:50.633 --> 00:05:52.833
When Boggart Knight's
in the game,

00:05:52.833 --> 00:05:54.466
I'm allowed
to double the trouble

00:05:54.466 --> 00:05:57.766
and summon another Saber monster
out to the field!

00:05:57.766 --> 00:06:01.600
XX‐Saber Ragigura
will give me the edge I need!

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.400
Ha‐ha, it's just a pathetic
little lizard man

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.933
with 200 attack points.

00:06:05.933 --> 00:06:08.966
With XX‐Saber Ragigura
on my field,

00:06:08.966 --> 00:06:11.000
I can add a sword
slicing X‐Saber

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.633
in my graveyard to my hand.

00:06:12.633 --> 00:06:15.600
I'm picking Faultroll!

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.600
And I can summon
my Faultroll

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.066
when I have at least
two X‐Sabers on my field.

00:06:20.066 --> 00:06:21.933
This guy can really
slice things up.

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:24.433
(growling)

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.966
And due to
its special ability,

00:06:27.966 --> 00:06:31.066
once a turn I can summon
a Level 4‐or‐below X‐Saber

00:06:31.066 --> 00:06:32.300
from my graveyard.

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.666
(gasps)

00:06:33.666 --> 00:06:35.433
His field's packed
as it is.

00:06:35.433 --> 00:06:37.333
It is fuller
than a Berliner!

00:06:37.333 --> 00:06:42.333
(Kit)
I'm bringing back the Tuner
Monster XX‐Saber Fulhelmknight!

00:06:44.633 --> 00:06:46.266
(all gasping)

00:06:46.266 --> 00:06:48.500
This doesn't
look too good.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.766
That's because it's not.

00:06:53.273 --> 00:06:55.106
Brace yourself.

00:06:55.106 --> 00:06:58.040
Level 3 Fulhelmknight tunes
Level 6 Faultroll!

00:07:00.573 --> 00:07:02.940
This is a tune
that's music to my ears.

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.206
I bet you can't wait to see
what's coming your way.

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:08.773
I Synchro Summon!

00:07:08.773 --> 00:07:11.506
Level 9 XX‐Saber Gottoms!

00:07:15.973 --> 00:07:17.573
No way.

00:07:17.573 --> 00:07:19.406
Kit bringing back
that powerful monster

00:07:19.406 --> 00:07:21.040
can't be good news
for Gong.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.906
That's true, but even though
it has 3,100 attack points,

00:07:23.906 --> 00:07:25.940
Gong's gonna
be safe and sound.

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:28.206
We'll see about that!

00:07:30.106 --> 00:07:31.806
It all gets decided
right here.

00:07:33.073 --> 00:07:35.373
Yes!
Just the card I need.

00:07:36.606 --> 00:07:40.106
And now, I play the Action Spell
Extreme Sword!

00:07:40.106 --> 00:07:41.440
(both gasp)

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.473
(Kit)
And it's extremely
bad news for you,

00:07:43.473 --> 00:07:46.406
'cause it adds 1,000 attack
points to my Gottoms!

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:49.440
(laughs)

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.306
You gotta love that
about an Action Duel.

00:07:52.306 --> 00:07:55.406
Gottoms, go get 'em!
Take out Big Benkei!

00:08:00.373 --> 00:08:02.073
Poor Big Benkei!

00:08:02.073 --> 00:08:04.040
It sure was lucky
it was in defense mode

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.773
so Gong won't
take any damage.

00:08:05.773 --> 00:08:07.173
(Kit)
Guess again.

00:08:07.173 --> 00:08:10.706
I'm activating... Meteorain!

00:08:10.706 --> 00:08:13.906
With this trap, when I attack
a monster in defense mode

00:08:13.906 --> 00:08:15.873
and my monster's
got more attack points

00:08:15.873 --> 00:08:17.706
than your monster's
got defense points,

00:08:17.706 --> 00:08:19.906
you take the difference
in damage.

00:08:19.906 --> 00:08:23.273
Here's what 600 points of damage
feels like, big brows.

00:08:23.273 --> 00:08:24.540
(growling)

00:08:26.506 --> 00:08:28.340
(all gasping)

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:38.140
It's... still here.

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:40.306
When Big Benkei
got attacked,

00:08:40.306 --> 00:08:43.106
Gong sent his Superheavy
Samurai Soulfire Suit

00:08:43.106 --> 00:08:46.606
from his hand straight
to the graveyard.

00:08:46.606 --> 00:08:48.140
Soon as Gong did that,

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:51.206
it kept Gong's
Superheavy Samurai Benkei

00:08:51.206 --> 00:08:53.540
from gettin' wiped out
this turn.

00:08:55.406 --> 00:08:57.173
So you weakened your hand

00:08:57.173 --> 00:08:58.973
to protect
your Superheavy superstar.

00:08:58.973 --> 00:09:00.140
That's right.

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.840
Only downside is
my Superheavy Samurai

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.706
loses 800 defense points.

00:09:05.706 --> 00:09:07.040
No sweat.

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:09.140
It still has more
than Souza's attack points.

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:12.240
Oh, yeah?
Not for long!

00:09:14.206 --> 00:09:15.606
Hey, an Action Card!

00:09:15.606 --> 00:09:18.806
(Kit)
Oh, no,
it's all the way over there!

00:09:18.806 --> 00:09:20.340
It's right near Gong!

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:22.006
Hurry
and grab it, Gong!

00:09:22.006 --> 00:09:23.640
Gong ain't moving.

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:24.573
Ahh!
Ahh!

00:09:24.573 --> 00:09:26.673
If you don't take it,
I will!

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:30.373
No!
Kit picked it up.

00:09:31.806 --> 00:09:34.640
How lucky and talented
can one guy get?

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:38.940
I get to activate the Action
Spell Extreme Sword once again,

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:42.473
and my Souza gets 1,000 more
attack points!

00:09:42.473 --> 00:09:44.340
Souza, take out Big Benkei!

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:45.973
(growling)

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.240
Soulbreaker Suit's
ability activates,

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.573
protecting Big Benkei
from being destroyed.

00:09:55.573 --> 00:09:57.140
Yeah, so what?

00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:00.306
Meteorain's effect means
you're taking more damage,
big brows!

00:10:00.306 --> 00:10:02.106
I hope they don't get singed!

00:10:04.906 --> 00:10:06.940
(screams)

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:08.206
(groans)

00:10:08.206 --> 00:10:09.606
(chuckles)

00:10:09.606 --> 00:10:11.940
Not only did you lose
800 life points,

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:15.973
but your Big Benkei also loses
another 800 defense points.

00:10:15.973 --> 00:10:19.473
Yeah, but now that
the battle is over,

00:10:19.473 --> 00:10:24.040
Gottoms and Souza's attack
points shrink back to normal.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.906
You only survived because
of the special abilities

00:10:26.906 --> 00:10:28.406
of the monsters
in your hand.

00:10:28.406 --> 00:10:31.940
Huh, so then I'll just have
to arrange to change that.

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:33.740
I tribute Boggart Knight

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:36.006
to activate Gottoms's
special ability!

00:10:36.006 --> 00:10:38.973
That means one card in your
hand's going to the graveyard.

00:10:38.973 --> 00:10:41.406
Huh?
What the...?

00:10:41.406 --> 00:10:44.606
(gasps)
Gong only has one card
in his left hand!

00:10:44.606 --> 00:10:46.840
I mean, he only has
one card in his hand left!

00:10:50.206 --> 00:10:52.440
I got more bad news
for you!
Huh?

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.740
I tribute Ragigura

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:57.806
to activate Gottoms's
special ability again!

00:11:00.973 --> 00:11:02.606
Gong lost
his last card!

00:11:05.173 --> 00:11:08.273
You were betting it all
on your hand, big brows,

00:11:08.273 --> 00:11:10.273
and now it's gone.

00:11:10.273 --> 00:11:14.106
Your heavy‐strong strategy
just got you owned!

00:11:14.106 --> 00:11:17.506
How can Gong win if he doesn't
have any cards in his hand?

00:11:17.506 --> 00:11:20.506
If he'd only taken
that Action Card
when he had the chance!

00:11:20.506 --> 00:11:21.773
Why didn't he?

00:11:21.773 --> 00:11:23.806
That Action Card could've
helped him win this duel!

00:11:23.806 --> 00:11:25.740
Now we are going
to lose our school!

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:27.473
Don't be so sure.
(all) Huh?

00:11:27.473 --> 00:11:30.806
Gong's deck has
never let him down.

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.473
The way Gong sees it,
Yuya,

00:11:35.473 --> 00:11:37.440
a person's gotta
trust in their deck

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:38.973
with their whole heart
and soul

00:11:38.973 --> 00:11:41.540
instead of counting on Action
Cards to help them win a duel.

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:43.940
Action Cards
are a coin toss.

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:47.873
Ugh, but not knowing
what you're gonna get's
way more exciting!

00:11:47.873 --> 00:11:50.106
Here, let me see
your deck.

00:11:50.106 --> 00:11:52.706
How you gonna
battle with this?

00:11:52.706 --> 00:11:56.106
It's the perfect deck for
Gong's "heavy‐strong" style.

00:11:56.106 --> 00:11:59.006
Gong believes
in his deck, Yuya.

00:11:59.006 --> 00:12:01.906
And Gong knows for sure
Gong can win with it.

00:12:04.873 --> 00:12:06.873
(Yuya)
All right, Gong.

00:12:06.873 --> 00:12:09.873
Make us believe
you can win with it, too.

00:12:16.738 --> 00:12:19.171
You are... going down!

00:12:21.338 --> 00:12:26.304
I summon the impenetrable
Superheavy Samurai
Soulshield Wall!

00:12:26.304 --> 00:12:29.138
And Gong's equippin' it
onto Big Benkei

00:12:29.138 --> 00:12:31.904
to give it
a 1,200‐point defense boost.

00:12:36.538 --> 00:12:39.471
A monster that can power up
another monster.

00:12:39.471 --> 00:12:41.171
You really got lucky.

00:12:41.171 --> 00:12:45.138
Luck had nothing to do
with Gong being able
to draw that monster,

00:12:45.138 --> 00:12:47.204
because it's all
part of Gong's plan.

00:12:47.204 --> 00:12:50.338
But now, Kit, the time
for talkin' is over!

00:12:50.338 --> 00:12:52.804
Big Benkei
attack X‐Saber Souza!

00:13:06.004 --> 00:13:07.238
(both)
Hooray!

00:13:07.238 --> 00:13:08.771
That's the way
to go, Gong!

00:13:08.771 --> 00:13:11.171
I'll show you.

00:13:11.171 --> 00:13:13.738
I am gonna finish you!

00:13:13.738 --> 00:13:15.038
I play the trap.

00:13:15.038 --> 00:13:16.804
Gottoms's Emergency Call!

00:13:16.804 --> 00:13:18.404
When there's
an X‐Saber on the field,

00:13:18.404 --> 00:13:21.171
it calls out two X‐Sabers
from the graveyard!

00:13:21.171 --> 00:13:26.104
Welcome back, X‐Saber
Souza and Ragigura!

00:13:26.104 --> 00:13:28.304
And with Ragigura's
special ability,

00:13:28.304 --> 00:13:32.038
I return Faultroll from
my graveyard to my hand.

00:13:32.038 --> 00:13:34.671
Amazing, it's not
even Kit's turn,

00:13:34.671 --> 00:13:36.771
but he's still capable
of finding a way

00:13:36.771 --> 00:13:38.004
to bring back
a bunch of monsters.

00:13:38.004 --> 00:13:40.871
It's just like I've been
trying to tell you, Julia,

00:13:40.871 --> 00:13:43.204
his X‐Saber deck's
a cut above the rest.

00:13:43.204 --> 00:13:45.571
You usually don't
have anything nice

00:13:45.571 --> 00:13:46.738
to say
about other decks,

00:13:46.738 --> 00:13:49.038
but I guess that's
what losing does.

00:13:49.038 --> 00:13:50.438
It makes you nicer.

00:13:50.438 --> 00:13:51.704
(groans)

00:13:51.704 --> 00:13:52.671
(thud)

00:13:56.338 --> 00:13:59.204
A hundred life points
and no cards in his hand.

00:13:59.204 --> 00:14:01.238
It's all over for Gong.

00:14:01.238 --> 00:14:02.938
It's not over!

00:14:02.938 --> 00:14:05.471
Not as long as his head's
still in the game.

00:14:10.904 --> 00:14:12.371
My turn.

00:14:15.738 --> 00:14:18.638
Hey, you remember
what this card can do?

00:14:18.638 --> 00:14:20.204
Gong does.

00:14:20.204 --> 00:14:22.838
Since you got
a squad of XX‐Sabers,

00:14:22.838 --> 00:14:25.338
you can automatically summon
that monster.

00:14:25.338 --> 00:14:27.638
I'm glad to see you were
paying attention!

00:14:27.638 --> 00:14:30.004
Come on out, Faultroll!

00:14:31.338 --> 00:14:34.338
Now Faultroll's special
ability activates.

00:14:34.338 --> 00:14:37.571
I can summon one Level 4
or below X‐Saber
from my graveyard

00:14:37.571 --> 00:14:39.804
and that's going to be
bad news for you!

00:14:39.804 --> 00:14:43.804
Say hello to the Tuner Monster
XX‐Saber Fulhelmknight!

00:14:47.204 --> 00:14:49.938
He's got Faultroll and
Fulhelmknight on his field

00:14:49.938 --> 00:14:51.038
and that adds up
to trouble!

00:14:51.038 --> 00:14:52.904
You betcha.

00:14:52.904 --> 00:14:55.771
Level 3 Fulhelmknight tunes
Level 6 Faultroll!

00:14:58.304 --> 00:15:01.938
(Kit)
It's time I tune you out of
this duel once and for all!

00:15:04.671 --> 00:15:06.304
I Synchro Summon!

00:15:06.304 --> 00:15:08.838
Level 9 XX‐Saber
Gottoms!

00:15:16.304 --> 00:15:20.771
I use X‐Saber Souza's special
ability to tribute Ragigura.

00:15:22.171 --> 00:15:25.071
You don't have any idea
why I did that, do you?

00:15:25.071 --> 00:15:26.738
But you will!

00:15:26.738 --> 00:15:30.271
X‐Saber Souza, take down that
super lightweight Big Benkei!

00:15:30.271 --> 00:15:33.871
But Kit's Souza is weaker
than Big Benkei!

00:15:33.871 --> 00:15:36.004
(growling)
That's not gonna matter!

00:15:36.004 --> 00:15:38.638
By getting rid of Ragigura,
my Souza

00:15:38.638 --> 00:15:41.704
is able to automatically destroy
any monster it's battling!

00:15:41.704 --> 00:15:42.938
(all gasp)

00:15:42.938 --> 00:15:44.171
This is awful.

00:15:44.171 --> 00:15:45.704
Gong's got no way
to protect himself!

00:15:45.704 --> 00:15:49.238
Now I'm gonna cut your
super‐heavy superstar
down to size.

00:15:49.238 --> 00:15:51.638
(growling)

00:15:51.638 --> 00:15:54.704
Soulshield Wall's ability
will stop that.

00:15:54.704 --> 00:15:56.538
By sending it
to the graveyard,

00:15:56.538 --> 00:15:58.138
Gong can stop your attack

00:15:58.138 --> 00:16:00.171
by making all the defense
points of the monster

00:16:00.171 --> 00:16:02.671
it's equipped to disappear.

00:16:05.471 --> 00:16:08.038
(groans)
Think you're smart,
don't you?

00:16:08.038 --> 00:16:11.771
But no matter what you do,
you still don't have a chance!

00:16:11.771 --> 00:16:13.638
I got two Saber Gottoms,

00:16:13.638 --> 00:16:16.438
one to destroy your monster
and one to destroy you!

00:16:16.438 --> 00:16:20.238
Gottoms number one, time to take
out his Superheavy Big Benkei!

00:16:20.238 --> 00:16:22.838
Gong was hoping
you'd say that.
Huh?

00:16:22.838 --> 00:16:24.738
'Cause now Gong's activating,

00:16:24.738 --> 00:16:29.304
Soulbreaker Armor's special
ability from Gong's graveyard!

00:16:29.304 --> 00:16:32.738
Wha... "Activate
from the graveyard?"

00:16:32.738 --> 00:16:34.571
Is that what I think
it is?

00:16:34.571 --> 00:16:36.204
Sure is.

00:16:36.204 --> 00:16:39.104
It's the exact same card
you used Gottoms's
special ability on

00:16:39.104 --> 00:16:40.704
to send to the graveyard.

00:16:40.704 --> 00:16:44.104
And you doing that is
what unleashes its truly
awesome power.

00:16:44.104 --> 00:16:46.604
When Gong banishes
Soulbreaker Armor

00:16:46.604 --> 00:16:50.138
and Gong doesn't have
any spell or trap cards
in Gong's graveyard,

00:16:50.138 --> 00:16:52.071
you lose life points
equal to the change

00:16:52.071 --> 00:16:54.138
in Big Benkei's
defense points.

00:16:54.138 --> 00:16:55.404
What?

00:16:55.404 --> 00:16:58.971
Gong's Big Benkei had 3,500
defense points before.

00:16:58.971 --> 00:17:00.538
Und now it has zero.

00:17:00.538 --> 00:17:03.871
That's 3,500 points
of damage, so...

00:17:03.871 --> 00:17:05.638
(all)
Gong's victorious!

00:17:08.271 --> 00:17:09.971
No way.

00:17:09.971 --> 00:17:12.438
Gong's strategy
worked out perfectly.

00:17:12.438 --> 00:17:15.238
Playing spells
and traps actually hurts
his heavy‐strong style,

00:17:15.238 --> 00:17:16.538
not helps it.

00:17:16.538 --> 00:17:18.838
That's why Gong packed his deck
with only monsters.

00:17:18.838 --> 00:17:19.971
Huh.

00:17:19.971 --> 00:17:22.338
A whole deck
built of monsters?

00:17:22.338 --> 00:17:24.204
That's the craziest thing
I've ever heard!

00:17:24.204 --> 00:17:25.671
I see.

00:17:25.671 --> 00:17:27.238
That's why you didn't
take any Action Cards

00:17:27.238 --> 00:17:28.404
when you had the chance.

00:17:28.404 --> 00:17:29.771
You got it, Kit.

00:17:29.771 --> 00:17:31.838
Gong don't need
no Action Spells
infecting Gong's deck.

00:17:37.004 --> 00:17:39.004
Well, spell cards
aren't all bad news!

00:17:39.004 --> 00:17:41.704
I play Saber Reflection!

00:17:41.704 --> 00:17:45.538
(Yuya)
Oh, no, that shield reflects
all the damage back to Gong!

00:17:45.538 --> 00:17:47.671
So Kit's gonna win
the duel!

00:17:47.671 --> 00:17:49.371
(Kit)
It's over, big brows!

00:17:57.917 --> 00:18:00.083
(Kit)
It's over, big brows!

00:18:00.083 --> 00:18:05.783
Gong activates Superheavy
Samurai Soulbang Cannon's
special ability!

00:18:05.783 --> 00:18:09.083
Hey, that's another card
I sent to the graveyard!

00:18:09.083 --> 00:18:13.517
Since Gong doesn't have
any spell or trap cards
lying around in his graveyard,

00:18:13.517 --> 00:18:16.983
Gong can banish this card to
dodge damage
from your spell!

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:20.183
That's for starters!

00:18:20.183 --> 00:18:23.283
All of the monsters
that we have on the field
get destroyed now,

00:18:23.283 --> 00:18:26.717
and we both take damage
equal to their total level,

00:18:26.717 --> 00:18:28.650
times one hundred!

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:31.550
What the...?

00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:33.683
The total level's 33
and that means...

00:18:33.683 --> 00:18:36.317
3,300 points of damage!

00:19:00.083 --> 00:19:01.517
It's kaput.

00:19:01.517 --> 00:19:02.517
It's a tie?

00:19:08.283 --> 00:19:10.117
Gong!
Are you okay?

00:19:10.117 --> 00:19:11.817
Come on.
(grunts)

00:19:11.817 --> 00:19:13.683
I'm sorry.

00:19:13.683 --> 00:19:17.050
Gong's heavy‐strong style just
wasn't enough to beat him.

00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:20.117
Maybe not, but he didn't
beat you either.

00:19:20.117 --> 00:19:22.383
And we all saw
something super important‐‐

00:19:22.383 --> 00:19:24.350
the power of a deck
you believe in.

00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:29.783
Yuya won, Zuzu lost,
and Gong ended up tying.

00:19:29.783 --> 00:19:33.617
Madame Chairwoman, the deal was
you'd take over this school

00:19:33.617 --> 00:19:36.750
if your team won the best
of a three‐match contest.

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:40.317
Your team only won one duel,
so the school stays ours.

00:19:40.317 --> 00:19:42.883
That's absolute nonsense.

00:19:42.883 --> 00:19:45.650
This duel is supposed to be
the tie‐breaker.

00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:47.717
The contest can't
be decided by a draw.

00:19:47.717 --> 00:19:51.883
(Skip Boyle)
It was a tie!
The last duel is over.

00:19:51.883 --> 00:19:54.083
Then we'll have another duel.

00:19:54.083 --> 00:19:55.617
The ones who won
their duels can duel

00:19:55.617 --> 00:19:58.217
against each other now,
agreed?

00:19:58.217 --> 00:20:01.583
(Skip Boyle)
You shouldn't get to decide!
Leave it up to the duelists.

00:20:07.217 --> 00:20:08.483
Yuya?

00:20:08.483 --> 00:20:11.417
Your boy looks like
he's raring to go.

00:20:11.417 --> 00:20:13.350
And so are we.

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:15.117
(Declan)
Wait.
Huh?

00:20:20.017 --> 00:20:22.083
I'll be the one to duel.

00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:07.550
