(Yuya)
Previously on
"YuGiOh Arc‐V"...

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.566
(screaming)

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.533
What now?

00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:12.566
We've picked up an intense
burst of Synchro energy

00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:15.300
in the Iceberg Zone!

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.200
Anybody else
around here?

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.066
Hello!

00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:21.600
(screaming)

00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:24.233
(gasping)

00:00:24.233 --> 00:00:26.900
(Aura)
There are two souls
residing inside my darling!

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.100
(all)
Say what now?

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.600
(Aura)
Wait, I'm also
sensing a third...

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.800
A darker, scarier
presence...

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.600
It's terrifying!

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.433
Mr. President, our ninjas
have escaped the intruders

00:00:37.433 --> 00:00:41.566
and led Zuzu and Celina
to safety.

00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:43.366
I'm going to track down
this Shay character,

00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:45.033
you told me about.

00:00:45.033 --> 00:00:47.233
I have to find out if
what you said is true.

(crowd booing)

00:01:51.866 --> 00:01:53.733
(woman)
This is ridiculous!

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.866
What a rip off!

00:01:56.866 --> 00:01:59.266
(woman)
I want my money back!

00:01:59.266 --> 00:02:01.900
The crowd is not happy
and I can't blame them,

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.900
because I'm not
happy either.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.966
I simply don't know
what's going on anymore.

00:02:06.966 --> 00:02:09.633
If I can't see the duels,
the who, what, when, how

00:02:09.633 --> 00:02:11.533
and why are
all a mystery to me!

00:02:11.533 --> 00:02:15.433
Which means, I can't offer my
incredible commentary!

00:02:15.433 --> 00:02:19.133
And that means
I don't get paid!

00:02:19.133 --> 00:02:22.066
(Tate)
Looks like the actions
still happening guys.

00:02:22.066 --> 00:02:23.133
See here?

00:02:23.133 --> 00:02:24.233
The duels are
all going on

00:02:24.233 --> 00:02:26.166
whether they have
an audience or not!

00:02:26.166 --> 00:02:28.633
So then those are
the results?

00:02:28.633 --> 00:02:31.966
Looks like two Senior Division
duelists lost their duels.

00:02:31.966 --> 00:02:34.400
Never mind
who lost, Tate...

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.333
Look who won in
the Youth Semi's.

00:02:36.333 --> 00:02:37.433
Riley.

00:02:37.433 --> 00:02:40.333
So the final
Youth matchup is set!

00:02:40.333 --> 00:02:42.500
Looks like it's me...

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.933
And him.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.600
Oh, hey...

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.066
It's you.

00:02:55.066 --> 00:02:57.200
So how's it
going, Yuri?

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.933
Did you
find her?

00:02:58.933 --> 00:02:59.933
Sure did!

00:02:59.933 --> 00:03:02.200
See for your‐‐
What in the?

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.433
She's surrounded.

00:03:05.433 --> 00:03:07.866
Uh‐oh...

00:03:07.866 --> 00:03:09.833
(Yuri)
Why are
they here?

00:03:09.833 --> 00:03:11.600
This is my job
not theirs.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.833
I thought the Professor ordered
only me to bring Zuzu back.

00:03:14.833 --> 00:03:16.400
Uh, I may
know why.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.400
Zuzu has
a lookalike.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.433
Her name's Celina and she
and Zuzu had a switcheroo

00:03:21.433 --> 00:03:22.633
with their outfits.

00:03:22.633 --> 00:03:24.833
Must be a case
of mistaken identity.

00:03:24.833 --> 00:03:27.833
Ya know, kinda like how you
and Yuya look similar.

00:03:27.833 --> 00:03:28.833
Yuya?

00:03:28.833 --> 00:03:29.933
Who is he?

00:03:29.933 --> 00:03:32.066
He's a duelist from
the standard dimension.

00:03:32.066 --> 00:03:34.133
(warbling)

00:03:42.733 --> 00:03:45.100
(Olga)
That's the last
time you steer!

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.233
(Halil)
Me?

00:03:46.233 --> 00:03:47.766
I thought you were
the one steering!

00:03:47.766 --> 00:03:50.266
Well that would
explain how we got here.

00:03:50.266 --> 00:03:51.266
Hey, look!

00:03:51.266 --> 00:03:52.800
We happened upon
some duelists!

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.133
Sure did.

00:03:54.133 --> 00:03:55.466
Care for an
autograph?

00:03:55.466 --> 00:03:56.800
Nyet.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.333
I care for a
Pendulum Card!

00:03:58.333 --> 00:03:59.866
Sorry but that
will have to wait.

00:03:59.866 --> 00:04:02.066
We're in the middle
of something.

00:04:02.066 --> 00:04:03.133
No.

00:04:03.133 --> 00:04:05.166
I'll make time
for these two.

00:04:05.166 --> 00:04:07.966
And now...
They will pay.

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.066
(Zuzu)
For Celina to find out
what really happened

00:04:15.066 --> 00:04:17.866
in the Xyz Dimension,
she needs to meet Shay,

00:04:17.866 --> 00:04:19.733
but to give her that chance
I'll need to keep these guys

00:04:19.733 --> 00:04:21.233
off her trail.

00:04:21.233 --> 00:04:22.433
So...

00:04:22.433 --> 00:04:24.033
Let's duel!

00:04:24.033 --> 00:04:26.800
♪

00:04:29.833 --> 00:04:31.866
The odds might
be against me,

00:04:31.866 --> 00:04:33.600
but I'm always
up for a challenge.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.800
'Cause when
the dueling gets tough,

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.700
the tough get dueling!

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.100
(Yuri)
Good to know!

00:04:45.066 --> 00:04:46.433
(gasping)

00:04:46.433 --> 00:04:48.666
Yuya?

00:04:48.666 --> 00:04:50.600
Yes, I heard we have a
resemblance, but no,

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.000
that's not me.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.500
Now to the matter
at hand.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.300
You three,
step away from the girl

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.933
or this will happen
to you!

00:05:00.566 --> 00:05:01.500
Huh?

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:02.700
What will?

00:05:05.266 --> 00:05:07.533
No way...

00:05:07.533 --> 00:05:09.900
That's Halil
and Olga...

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:10.966
What did you
do to them?

00:05:10.966 --> 00:05:12.633
Nothing they
didn't deserve.

00:05:12.633 --> 00:05:14.866
I trapped their souls
in these cards.

00:05:14.866 --> 00:05:18.200
That's what they get for
interfering with my business.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.933
My business with you.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.500
(Zuzu)
Other than Yuto, Yuya
said there was another guy

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.433
that looked just like
him named Yugo.

00:05:27.433 --> 00:05:30.000
This must be him.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.233
So you're
responsible for this?

00:05:32.233 --> 00:05:33.366
That's right.

00:05:33.366 --> 00:05:35.600
Then you're
a monster!

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.566
That's a bit harsh,
don't you think?

00:05:37.566 --> 00:05:38.600
No!

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.733
But I can't wait
to show you what is!

00:05:39.733 --> 00:05:41.833
Now, now, watch
your temper.

00:05:41.833 --> 00:05:45.666
You don't want to be
turned into a card, do you?

00:05:45.666 --> 00:05:47.833
That is to
say...

00:05:47.833 --> 00:05:50.200
If the Professor didn't
have other plans for you.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.333
The Professor?

00:05:52.333 --> 00:05:54.666
He rules Duel Academy
with an iron fist

00:05:54.666 --> 00:05:58.333
and his orders
are the supreme law.

00:05:58.333 --> 00:06:00.766
What does he
want with me?

00:06:00.766 --> 00:06:02.033
Beats me...

00:06:02.033 --> 00:06:04.733
I mean, you're a dead
ringer for Lulu and Rin

00:06:04.733 --> 00:06:06.600
so maybe that's why
he wants you.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.700
Lulu?

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:08.800
You know
Lulu?

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.066
Does that mean you're
the one who took her?

00:06:11.066 --> 00:06:12.566
Right
you are.

00:06:12.566 --> 00:06:14.033
Where did you
take her?

00:06:14.033 --> 00:06:18.833
The same place that I'm
going to be taking you.

00:06:18.833 --> 00:06:21.433
You are coming back with
me to my dimension,

00:06:21.433 --> 00:06:24.400
so I can deliver
you to the Professor.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.266
Well, you can tell him there's
been a change of plans!

00:06:27.266 --> 00:06:30.100
We can do this the easy
way or the hard way.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:32.366
I'm offering
you the easy way,

00:06:32.366 --> 00:06:34.933
but I hope you refuse because
I prefer the hard way!

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.266
I'm offering
you the easy way,

00:06:42.266 --> 00:06:45.800
but I hope you refuse because
I prefer the hard way.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.066
(laughing)

00:06:54.966 --> 00:06:57.000
Wow, nice
moves there...

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.500
You remind me a bit
of Lulu and Rin...

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.200
A lot, in fact.

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.900
Tell you
what, Zuzu...

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.500
How about we duel, and
if I win you come with me

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.333
and if you win...
you go.

00:07:08.333 --> 00:07:09.466
Make a deal
with you?

00:07:09.466 --> 00:07:10.500
No way!

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.500
I don't
trust you!

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.400
Maybe you don't
trust yourself...

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.133
Maybe you know you don't
stand a chance against me

00:07:17.133 --> 00:07:19.400
in a duel and are
just plain scared.

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.033
In your dreams!

00:07:21.033 --> 00:07:22.366
So then
prove it.

00:07:22.366 --> 00:07:24.566
Let's see
your skills.

00:07:24.566 --> 00:07:25.633
Fine!

00:07:25.633 --> 00:07:26.966
But you asked
for it...

00:07:26.966 --> 00:07:28.200
You're so
going down!

00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:32.966
(Dennis)
Looks like Yuri can pretty
much take things from here.

00:07:32.966 --> 00:07:35.833
Now how about letting
me help all of you?

00:07:35.833 --> 00:07:36.900
I aim to please!

00:07:39.433 --> 00:07:41.066
What's this?

00:07:41.066 --> 00:07:43.633
First a frozen wasteland
and now fire?

00:07:43.633 --> 00:07:45.633
This is one
very strange world.

00:07:45.633 --> 00:07:47.966
(boy)
Watch your left!

00:07:47.966 --> 00:07:51.700
What have
we here?

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:52.833
They've got
us surrounded!

00:07:52.833 --> 00:07:54.100
(boy)
We may be outnumbered,

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:56.266
but our monsters are
stronger than theirs!

00:07:56.266 --> 00:07:57.866
Remember, we're LID!

00:07:57.866 --> 00:07:59.466
We're the best
of the best!

00:07:59.466 --> 00:08:01.333
Well let's see how
your best measures up

00:08:01.333 --> 00:08:05.066
after I activate the spell
Ancient Armageddon Gear!

00:08:05.066 --> 00:08:09.800
Now Triple Ancient Gear Hunting
Hound can attack three times!

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.000
(growling)

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.966
First I'll attack
your Leodrake!

00:08:13.966 --> 00:08:15.266
(boy)
Whatever!

00:08:15.266 --> 00:08:16.700
My Leodrake has more
attack points

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:18.533
than your
triple‐headed mutt!

00:08:18.533 --> 00:08:19.866
That's what
you think!

00:08:19.866 --> 00:08:22.133
My Hunting Hounds
hunt like a pack!

00:08:22.133 --> 00:08:24.400
Since your monster
has a Gear Counter,

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:27.233
Double Ancient Gear Hunting
Hound's special ability

00:08:27.233 --> 00:08:30.266
automatically
destroys your monster!

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:34.133
But it's not
over yet!

00:08:34.133 --> 00:08:37.000
Next, due to Ancient
Armageddon Gear's effect,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.033
you take damage equal to the
attack points of your Leodrake,

00:08:40.033 --> 00:08:42.533
which is 3,000!

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:47.566
No!

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:52.200
(gasping)

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.800
Please, don't!

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:55.900
No!

00:09:03.633 --> 00:09:05.033
(laughing)

00:09:07.333 --> 00:09:10.133
And now it's time for
you to join your friend

00:09:10.133 --> 00:09:13.166
so we can add you to
our collection!

00:09:13.166 --> 00:09:14.900
(screaming)

00:09:25.866 --> 00:09:29.866
I've seen
this before...

00:09:29.866 --> 00:09:31.466
(screaming)

00:09:36.666 --> 00:09:37.733
Those creeps!

00:09:37.733 --> 00:09:39.400
They just
won't stop!

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.666
So I'll have to
stop them!

00:09:41.666 --> 00:09:45.300
You're the last one standing,
but you won't be for long!

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:47.133
(Yugo)
Not so fast!

00:09:50.133 --> 00:09:51.533
(gasping)

00:09:57.233 --> 00:09:59.066
(woman)
Intruder in
the Volcano Zone!

00:09:59.066 --> 00:10:00.700
Who is he?

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.800
He doesn't appear to be
working with those Fusion
Warriors!

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.133
Is he here to
help us?

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.933
Think I'll crash
your little battle royal

00:10:12.933 --> 00:10:14.866
by summoning
Speedroid Menko!

00:10:19.533 --> 00:10:21.866
Now, thanks to Menko's
special ability,

00:10:21.866 --> 00:10:24.700
all your monsters immediately
switch into defense mode!

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:31.300
No!

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:32.433
Curse you...

00:10:32.433 --> 00:10:34.066
That means
we can't attack!

00:10:34.066 --> 00:10:35.100
You'll pay for this!

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:36.033
Who are you?

00:10:36.033 --> 00:10:36.966
Yugo.

00:10:36.966 --> 00:10:38.233
You go?

00:10:38.233 --> 00:10:39.400
We go
where?

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:40.766
Yugo's my name!

00:10:40.766 --> 00:10:42.900
But you are
going somewhere...

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:45.833
Going down!

00:10:45.833 --> 00:10:48.433
I summon Speedroid
Tri‐Eyed Dice!

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:58.633
And now, I tune Level 3 Tri‐Eyed
Dice with Level 4 Menko!

00:11:04.966 --> 00:11:08.366
Beat your wings to whip up
a whirlwind of destruction!

00:11:10.466 --> 00:11:12.700
I synchro summon...

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:14.900
Clear Wing
Synchro Dragon!

00:11:20.266 --> 00:11:21.966
He must be from
the Synchro Dimension.

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:27.166
Heh!

00:11:27.166 --> 00:11:29.900
Like that's supposed
to scare me?

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:32.500
Double Ancient Gear Hunting
Hound's special ability

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:35.866
will destroy that
monster in no time!

00:11:35.866 --> 00:11:39.200
Now your Syncrho Dragon will
be perishing at light speed!

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.600
Don't be so sure.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.033
Say what?

00:11:42.033 --> 00:11:45.400
Clear Wing Synchro Dragon not
only stops that special ability,

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:48.100
but it destroys your
Hunting Hound as well!

00:11:51.366 --> 00:11:55.100
And the icing on the cake,
your own card deals you damage!

00:11:57.733 --> 00:12:00.533
Oh, man, it doesn't get
much worse than that!

00:12:00.533 --> 00:12:01.633
You're wrong...

00:12:01.633 --> 00:12:03.633
It gets a
whole lot worse...

00:12:03.633 --> 00:12:05.966
Because now Synchro Dragon
gains attack points

00:12:05.966 --> 00:12:09.400
equal to his Hunting
Hound's attack points and...

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:10.500
There's more!

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:12.033
Next I activate...

00:12:12.033 --> 00:12:16.733
The spell card Synchro Cracker
to finish you once and for all!

00:12:16.733 --> 00:12:19.300
By returning Synchro Dragon
to my Extra Deck,

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:22.000
all monsters with fewer
attack points are destroyed.

00:12:23.466 --> 00:12:26.566
And just when you thought things
couldn't get any worse,

00:12:26.566 --> 00:12:29.166
Ancient Armageddon
Gear's effect activates,

00:12:29.166 --> 00:12:31.133
dealing you damage equal
to the attack points

00:12:31.133 --> 00:12:33.266
of all your
destroyed Hunting Hounds!

00:12:34.733 --> 00:12:37.033
(groaning)

00:12:37.033 --> 00:12:38.266
(Claude)
Unbelievable!

00:12:38.266 --> 00:12:39.233
He beat them all!

00:12:39.233 --> 00:12:40.633
Yes, he did.

00:12:40.633 --> 00:12:42.033
How intriguing.

00:12:47.833 --> 00:12:49.866
Hey, are
you okay?

00:12:49.866 --> 00:12:51.300
Please
don't hurt me!

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:53.400
I'm the fragile
type!

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.466
Hey!

00:12:56.466 --> 00:12:57.633
You know...

00:12:57.633 --> 00:13:00.300
The least he could've
done is say thank you.

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:02.166
Mr. President we might
have defeated them,

00:13:02.166 --> 00:13:04.700
but I fear this is
only the first wave.

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:06.866
We need to gather more
reinforcements, sir.

00:13:06.866 --> 00:13:07.866
Agreed.

00:13:07.866 --> 00:13:09.566
But the question
remains,

00:13:09.566 --> 00:13:12.633
exactly what type of
reinforcements shall we send?

00:13:12.633 --> 00:13:15.000
The best that Leo
has to offer.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.800
Claude, don't you have
the sense to realize by now?

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.633
Our best isn't
good enough.

00:13:19.633 --> 00:13:22.000
It's not
even close.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.900
The enemy we face
is a new breed

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:27.066
so in order to defeat them we
need something new ourselves,

00:13:27.066 --> 00:13:29.333
and in the dueling universe
there's nothing newer

00:13:29.333 --> 00:13:30.966
than Pendulum Summoning,

00:13:30.966 --> 00:13:33.666
and there's no duelists
who know it better...

00:13:33.666 --> 00:13:35.633
Than Yuya Sakaki.

00:13:35.633 --> 00:13:37.633
He and the next
generation of duelists

00:13:37.633 --> 00:13:39.033
are on the cutting
edge.

00:13:39.033 --> 00:13:41.933
And that's the edge we
need to stand any chance

00:13:41.933 --> 00:13:44.766
of being victorious in
this high‐stakes battle.

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:48.933
Why's it always
about Yuya?

00:13:48.933 --> 00:13:50.166
Sylvio?

00:13:50.166 --> 00:13:51.433
Impossible!

00:13:51.433 --> 00:13:52.800
How'd you get
past security?

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.700
Because I wanted to,
and what I want I get.

00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:58.666
And right now I wanna second
shot in the tournament!

00:13:58.666 --> 00:14:00.733
I want a second
shot at Yuya!

00:14:00.733 --> 00:14:02.100
Too bad.

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:03.433
Aw, come on,
Declan!

00:14:03.433 --> 00:14:04.833
You know
how good I am.

00:14:04.833 --> 00:14:07.133
You're running this
tournament, change the rules!

00:14:07.133 --> 00:14:09.533
I want back
in the action!

00:14:09.533 --> 00:14:10.800
I see...

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.900
Very well then, I'll
give you a second shot.

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:15.400
You'll what?

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:17.966
♪

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:26.366
(Yuya)
Are there really
two souls inside of me?

00:14:26.366 --> 00:14:30.600
And if there are, one of
them's you, isn't it Yuto?

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:34.100
Because when I saw those guys
seal those duelists up in cards,

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:36.933
I suddenly remembered all the
people of the Xyz Dimension

00:14:36.933 --> 00:14:38.600
getting sealed
up in cards, too.

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:40.766
And those memories
weren't mine.

00:14:40.766 --> 00:14:42.400
They were yours, Yuto.

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:44.933
The worlds getting
so dark and scary.

00:14:44.933 --> 00:14:47.666
But then
I remembered...

00:14:47.666 --> 00:14:53.700
Use your power to keep the world
entertained... and smiling.

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:56.200
Your words were
all about hope and joy.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:59.666
That's why I know it's not
you who's caused me to lose
control.

00:14:59.666 --> 00:15:03.100
When you were passed out, I
sensed another presence in you.

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:05.033
There was also some
kind of darkness

00:15:05.033 --> 00:15:07.266
trying to take
over the both of you.

00:15:07.266 --> 00:15:09.800
There's darkness
in me somewhere

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.066
and if this darkness
takes over me again,

00:15:12.066 --> 00:15:16.300
I'm afraid of what I might
do especially to my friends.

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:20.300
(Yusho)
And when things get tough,
respond with a smile.

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:24.100
It will give you the strength
to keep moving forward!

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:25.166
Hold on.

00:15:25.166 --> 00:15:27.000
I do know what
to do!

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.300
I can't let
fear overtake me.

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.033
I'm going to keep
fighting!

00:15:31.033 --> 00:15:33.766
And I know that
you'll help me, Yuto!

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:40.833
Because it's exactly
like you said,

00:15:40.833 --> 00:15:44.400
dueling is all about keeping the
world entertained and smiling!

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:46.133
We'll get through
this together!

00:15:46.133 --> 00:15:47.633
And we'll win!

00:15:47.633 --> 00:15:49.733
And there one more
thing we'll do...

00:15:49.733 --> 00:15:51.400
Put on a great show!

00:15:54.766 --> 00:15:56.500
Rise and
shine everyone!

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:57.933
(Reed)
Who's up for
some breakfast?

00:15:58.933 --> 00:16:03.466
♪

00:16:03.466 --> 00:16:05.100
Reed, you've
done it again.

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:06.500
This is delicious!

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:09.533
Aw, I just put together some
stuff we had laying around.

00:16:09.533 --> 00:16:10.800
Don't be modest.

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:13.300
If I made a meal of what
we had laying around,

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:15.600
we'd be eating dirt
and twig sandwiches.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:16.966
Trout is right.

00:16:16.966 --> 00:16:19.866
Gong thanks you for this
very fine sustenance.

00:16:19.866 --> 00:16:22.233
It's what Yuya needed
to regain his strength.

00:16:22.233 --> 00:16:23.666
Well done, Reed!

00:16:23.666 --> 00:16:25.100
Reed, Reed, Reed...

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:26.466
If I'd know all
it took was a meal

00:16:26.466 --> 00:16:28.433
to save my sweet
precious darling Yuya

00:16:28.433 --> 00:16:29.766
I'd have ordered
delivery.

00:16:29.766 --> 00:16:31.200
I am out
of here!

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.500
Hey!

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:33.966
I don't know where
I'm going!

00:16:33.966 --> 00:16:36.133
She seems upset.

00:16:36.133 --> 00:16:37.466
Yeah, no kidding.

00:16:37.466 --> 00:16:39.666
Still, since she's not
in the tournament,

00:16:39.666 --> 00:16:41.500
I guess she can run off
to wherever she wants.

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:44.000
Oh, she'll
have company.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.900
After all, she's not the only
duelist around these parts

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:48.700
here for their
own personal reasons.

00:16:53.166 --> 00:16:54.566
Like Sora...

00:16:54.566 --> 00:16:55.500
Huh?

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:57.100
What about Sora?

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:59.866
He's back, but I don't think
he's on our side anymore.

00:17:05.066 --> 00:17:06.866
(Zuzu)
I should've known dueling
this guy was mistake.

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.866
(Yuri)
Come out, come out
wherever you are!

00:17:13.866 --> 00:17:16.133
I commend you for evading
me for this long,

00:17:16.133 --> 00:17:18.166
but let's
face facts...

00:17:18.166 --> 00:17:22.266
We will sniff you out
eventually, so give up!

00:17:22.266 --> 00:17:24.066
Come on, get out
of the cold

00:17:24.066 --> 00:17:27.033
and return with me to
see the Professor.

00:17:28.933 --> 00:17:30.766
(roaring)

00:17:34.333 --> 00:17:35.466
(shrieking)

00:17:37.166 --> 00:17:39.100
Well, well,
look what I found.

00:17:49.633 --> 00:17:52.100
(shrieking)

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:54.800
Well, well, look
what I found.

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:57.000
(Zuzu)
Oh no,
I'm cornered.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.866
Yuya, I wish you
were here!

00:18:01.333 --> 00:18:02.933
What this?

00:18:05.166 --> 00:18:07.600
It's glowing,
like it did before.

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:08.600
Yuya?

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:10.000
Are you here?

00:18:12.833 --> 00:18:13.833
Huh?

00:18:13.833 --> 00:18:15.166
Rin?

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:19.333
Rin!

00:18:20.566 --> 00:18:22.100
You're safe!

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:23.166
Sorry...

00:18:23.166 --> 00:18:24.333
But, uh...

00:18:24.333 --> 00:18:26.900
Wrong girl.

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:29.566
You remind me a bit
of Lulu and Rin...

00:18:29.566 --> 00:18:31.200
A lot, in fact.

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:32.800
Wait, why did
you think I was Rin?

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:33.833
Who is this
girl?

00:18:42.733 --> 00:18:44.266
I can't
believe it...

00:18:44.266 --> 00:18:45.866
That's Zuzu
down there!

00:18:45.866 --> 00:18:48.166
First she acts all flirty
with my honey bunny Yuya

00:18:48.166 --> 00:18:51.266
and now she's all
lovey‐dovey with another guy!

00:18:51.266 --> 00:18:53.633
What nerve!

00:18:53.633 --> 00:18:55.133
(screaming)

00:18:57.466 --> 00:18:59.400
Now that's a
brain freeze...

00:19:00.766 --> 00:19:02.933
Hey, Yuya!

00:19:02.933 --> 00:19:05.200
Dennis?

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:06.666
Hey, did
you hear?

00:19:06.666 --> 00:19:08.766
I just had a match
with Zuzu and won!

00:19:08.766 --> 00:19:10.533
Zuzu?
Where at?

00:19:10.533 --> 00:19:12.033
The Volcano zone.

00:19:12.033 --> 00:19:13.100
Why?

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:14.600
There's
trouble.

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:17.666
All kinds of duelists are
causing all kinds of mayhem!

00:19:17.666 --> 00:19:20.166
Whadaya mean by
"all kinds"?

00:19:20.166 --> 00:19:22.533
Well, this is
hard to believe,

00:19:22.533 --> 00:19:24.966
but there are duelists from
other dimensions here!

00:19:24.966 --> 00:19:26.533
Other dimensions?

00:19:26.533 --> 00:19:27.733
Quit joking,
Yuya.

00:19:27.733 --> 00:19:28.966
It's no joke.

00:19:28.966 --> 00:19:30.400
They're here and
they mean business.

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:31.933
My friend Sora's
one of 'em!

00:19:31.933 --> 00:19:33.500
Interesting...

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:35.733
Hey, it must be pretty
cool to have a friend

00:19:35.733 --> 00:19:37.533
from another
dimension.

00:19:37.533 --> 00:19:38.866
Not really.

00:19:38.866 --> 00:19:40.766
We're not sure what he's up to
and that's why Gong and I

00:19:40.766 --> 00:19:42.500
are sticking together.

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:45.500
It's not safe to be alone, so
we're looking for our friends,

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:47.700
trying to make
sure they're okay.

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:50.433
Four of us split up earlier so
we could cover more ground.

00:19:50.433 --> 00:19:52.500
Wow, this
sounds serious.

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:55.066
Zuzu said she was going
to the Iceberg zone.

00:19:55.066 --> 00:19:56.300
Let's look there!

00:19:58.533 --> 00:19:59.966
Whadaya mean
"who's Rin?"

00:19:59.966 --> 00:20:01.533
You're Rin!

00:20:01.533 --> 00:20:03.166
What's that?
Now what's happening?

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:11.666
Zuzu?

00:20:11.666 --> 00:20:12.633
You out here?

00:20:12.633 --> 00:20:14.000
Don't see her.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.733
Think she went to
another zone?

00:20:15.733 --> 00:20:17.500
(Dennis)
Yuri must
have gotten her.

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:20.033
Looks like the pieces are
all falling into place.

00:20:27.333 --> 00:20:30.666
(Sora)
Quite a duel we've had
up to this point, Shay...

00:20:30.666 --> 00:20:35.566
But I'm going to make sure
this duel ends here and now!

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:39.500
Yes!

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:41.400
This is just
what I needed...

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.566
Here goes!

00:20:42.566 --> 00:20:46.166
I activate Fluffal Mouse's
special ability!

00:20:46.166 --> 00:20:48.933
Since my Mouse is
currently in attack mode,

00:20:48.933 --> 00:20:50.900
I'm allowed to summon
two Fluffal Mice

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:52.366
straight
from my deck!

00:20:53.933 --> 00:20:58.866
Now, get ready, 'cause this
here's the good part!

00:20:58.866 --> 00:21:02.866
I fuse Edge Imp Sabres
and my three Fluffal Mice!

00:21:02.866 --> 00:21:05.966
Edge of sharpness and
mayhem of mice...

00:21:05.966 --> 00:21:09.733
When the four come together,
you will pay the price!

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:15.033
I Fusion Summon!

00:21:15.033 --> 00:21:17.366
Frightfur Tiger!

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:25.300
And now Frightfur Tiger's
special ability activates!

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:28.266
So four of your feathered
flock are fricasseed!

00:21:28.266 --> 00:21:29.633
Your goose
is cooked!

00:21:30.633 --> 00:21:31.800
Oh, no!

00:21:35.433 --> 00:21:38.233
And now your one remaining
Force Strix's attack points

00:21:38.233 --> 00:21:40.866
drop to a
measly 100!

00:21:40.866 --> 00:21:42.033
Too bad.

00:21:48.133 --> 00:21:50.066
(panting)

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:53.600
Next my Tiger gains
300 attack points

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:55.666
for each Frighfur
monster I have...

00:21:55.666 --> 00:21:57.666
And I have
one right now!

00:21:57.666 --> 00:22:00.500
So that's 300
extra points!

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:02.666
And now,
to use 'em!

00:22:02.666 --> 00:22:05.766
Frightfur Tiger,
attack!

00:22:05.766 --> 00:22:09.100
Destroy that Force Strix,
finish Shay...

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:11.800
And every single
thing that he fights for!

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:16.733
That's Shay?

00:22:16.733 --> 00:22:18.800
(screaming)

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:31.733
Oh, no!

00:22:31.733 --> 00:22:33.566
How will I ever
find out the truth now?

00:23:06.433 --> 00:23:09.433
