WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.366
Previously
on "YuGiOh! Arc‐V"...

00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:07.033
The duel between
the dueltainer extraordinaire

00:00:07.033 --> 00:00:08.600
Yuya Sakaki

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.100
and flawless
fortune‐teller

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.700
and prodigious predictress
Aura Sentia

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.333
is about to begin!

00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:18.866
My fortune‐telling
abilities are never wrong.

00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:20.900
With it, I'll learn if
you're truly destined

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.000
to be my one and only
duelmate.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Your destined duelmate?
What're you talking‐‐

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.366
You'll see.

00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:27.800
(both)
Duel!

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.233
I Flip Summon Prediction
Princess Coinorma!

00:00:31.233 --> 00:00:33.266
Flip Summoning is when
you summon a monster

00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:37.066
by flipping it from
facedown to faceup.

00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:39.966
I play my spell
Prediction Ritual.

00:00:42.433 --> 00:00:44.500
I Ritual Summon...

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.300
Prediction
Princess Tarotrei!

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.733
I don't like
the looks of this!

00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:53.100
I have to win!

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.333
Making the Junior Arc
League Championship'll

00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:57.900
put me on the path
to becoming a pro!

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.566
I'm taking control of
this duel starting now!

00:01:01.566 --> 00:01:03.666
Swing far,
Pendulum!

00:01:03.666 --> 00:01:05.633
Carve the arc
of victory!

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.266
Five monsters
at once!

00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:10.400
I got
the goosepickles!

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.500
Tarotrei will tell
your fortune...

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.300
and your fate!

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.200
Looks like my Tarotrei
has selected The Tower,

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.566
right side up.

00:01:18.566 --> 00:01:21.133
This card foretells
destruction, downfall,

00:01:21.133 --> 00:01:23.766
and worse, tragedy.

00:01:23.766 --> 00:01:25.866
Aah!

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.200
Forfeit this duel,
Yuya.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.933
If you choose
to continue,

00:01:31.933 --> 00:01:33.933
this will be
the last duel of your life.

You sure you wanna

00:02:40.866 --> 00:02:42.433
Yeah!

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.033
(Ally)
This is terrifying
for Yuya.

00:02:52.033 --> 00:02:54.566
That fortune‐teller girl said,
if he continues,

00:02:54.566 --> 00:02:56.333
this will be the last
duel of his life!

00:02:56.333 --> 00:02:57.966
That's baloney!

00:02:57.966 --> 00:03:00.666
Aura's just saying that
to make Yuya quit the duel!

00:03:00.666 --> 00:03:03.033
Ja, but one thing is
for sure.

00:03:03.033 --> 00:03:05.033
Yuya is
in very bad trouble!

00:03:05.033 --> 00:03:06.633
I know,
all the monsters

00:03:06.633 --> 00:03:08.233
he brought out when
he Pendulum Summoned

00:03:08.233 --> 00:03:10.066
got switched into
defense mode.

00:03:10.066 --> 00:03:12.366
And because
of Petalelf's
special ability,

00:03:12.366 --> 00:03:15.100
they can't switch back
to attack mode this turn.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.133
And since he doesn't have
any cards in his hand,

00:03:17.133 --> 00:03:19.800
he's gonna have a hard,
if not impossible, time

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.933
to counteract
Aura's strategies.

00:03:21.933 --> 00:03:24.000
What can Yuya do
to win?

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.900
(thinking) I can't do
anything right now,

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.033
but I still
have monsters.

00:03:29.033 --> 00:03:31.666
And as long as
I have them,

00:03:31.666 --> 00:03:33.366
<i>I still have a chance!</i>

00:03:33.366 --> 00:03:35.600
This is your
final warning!

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.700
Forfeit this duel now,
Yuya, or this will be

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.466
the last duel
you'll ever have!

00:03:39.466 --> 00:03:41.166
You don't scare me.

00:03:41.166 --> 00:03:43.233
I end my turn.

00:03:43.233 --> 00:03:45.666
But I'm never
quitting this duel!

00:03:45.666 --> 00:03:48.166
Then my conscience
is clear.

00:03:48.166 --> 00:03:49.800
You will regret this.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.133
I draw!

00:03:51.133 --> 00:03:52.766
It's a monster card,

00:03:52.766 --> 00:03:55.233
and I place it face down
in defense mode!

00:03:55.233 --> 00:03:56.666
Yah!

00:03:58.766 --> 00:04:00.200
This can't be good.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.000
Wonder what kind of monster
it'll be this time?

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.533
I activate another one of
Prediction Princess Tarotrei's

00:04:06.533 --> 00:04:08.966
special abilities!

00:04:08.966 --> 00:04:11.833
This ability flips
Prediction Princess Petalelf

00:04:11.833 --> 00:04:13.900
from faceup
to facedown.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.200
Go Full Sleep!

00:04:20.033 --> 00:04:22.933
All these moves are
starting to flip me out.

00:04:22.933 --> 00:04:24.533
(Tatsuya)
Yuya's in big trouble.

00:04:24.533 --> 00:04:26.633
None of Yuya's monsters
have more than

00:04:26.633 --> 00:04:28.800
2,400 defense points,

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.900
And Tarotrei's got
2,600 attack points!

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.100
It can destroy
any monster it wants!

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.966
Now, I'll...
end my turn.

00:04:40.766 --> 00:04:43.166
(all gasp)

00:04:43.166 --> 00:04:44.866
Don't be shocked.

00:04:44.866 --> 00:04:47.766
There's isn't any need for
me to attack you right now.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.433
Nothing will change
the fact that your

00:04:50.433 --> 00:04:52.200
destiny's already
been sealed.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.566
(growling)
Yeah?

00:04:53.566 --> 00:04:55.566
Well, I'm gonna
prove you wrong!

00:04:55.566 --> 00:04:57.000
Now I draw!

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.866
I'm changin' things up
and switchin' Odd‐Eyes

00:05:01.866 --> 00:05:04.233
from defense mode
to attack mode.

00:05:04.233 --> 00:05:05.666
(roaring)

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.700
That won't help you.

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.800
I activate Tarotrei's
special ability!

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.100
I can flip
my facedown monsters

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.800
faceup in
attack mode!

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.166
So, you can switch
your monsters

00:05:26.166 --> 00:05:28.733
faceup or facedown
whenever you want?

00:05:28.733 --> 00:05:31.833
That's right because
Prediction Princess Tarotrei

00:05:31.833 --> 00:05:34.400
can control
any card's destiny.

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.800
Next, Petalelf's

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.500
special ability
activates!

00:05:39.866 --> 00:05:42.033
Now, your mighty
Odd‐Eyes is switched

00:05:42.033 --> 00:05:43.433
back to defense mode,

00:05:43.433 --> 00:05:44.933
joining the rest
of your monsters.

00:05:44.933 --> 00:05:47.166
And don't forget,
they can't change

00:05:47.166 --> 00:05:49.566
to attack mode
this turn!

00:05:49.566 --> 00:05:51.566
(growling)
Just great.

00:05:55.533 --> 00:05:56.833
Your monsters are
in lockdown!

00:05:56.833 --> 00:05:58.533
Not good.

00:05:58.533 --> 00:06:00.933
If Yuya's monsters are
stuck in defense mode,

00:06:00.933 --> 00:06:03.466
he can't attack
during his turn!

00:06:03.466 --> 00:06:06.800
Ach! Maybe that girl's
predictions are coming true!

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.633
Next up,
Prediction Princess
Astromorrigan's

00:06:09.633 --> 00:06:11.666
special ability
activates!

00:06:11.666 --> 00:06:13.166
At the end
of this turn,

00:06:13.166 --> 00:06:16.233
say goodbye to your doomed
monsters in defense mode.

00:06:16.233 --> 00:06:17.800
They'll all
be destroyed.

00:06:19.366 --> 00:06:21.266
And it gets worse,
Yuya.

00:06:21.266 --> 00:06:23.133
You take
200 points of damage

00:06:23.133 --> 00:06:24.933
for every monster
that it destroys!

00:06:27.833 --> 00:06:30.600
Now I see why she didn't
attack last turn.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.866
It was so she could
use this special ability

00:06:32.866 --> 00:06:35.000
to deal even more
damage!

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.833
Even before I played
my very first card today,

00:06:37.833 --> 00:06:39.066
Yuya...

00:06:39.066 --> 00:06:41.633
my victory was
destined to happen.

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.166
That...
that can't be true.

00:06:46.666 --> 00:06:49.400
Oh, but it is!

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.900
The truth is clear.

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.933
You have no choice
but to face it, Yuya.

00:06:53.933 --> 00:06:57.166
You're heading for
total destruction.

00:06:57.166 --> 00:06:59.066
(thinking)
<i>Destruction...</i>

00:07:00.833 --> 00:07:02.700
There's not much time
left for you.

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:04.900
Your only chance
to rewrite your future

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:06.566
is to surrender now.

00:07:08.933 --> 00:07:10.766
Surrender?

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.366
No, not good.

00:07:16.366 --> 00:07:19.600
(thinking)
Yuya is paralyzed by
his opponent's prognosis!

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.200
In my crystal ball,
I see disaster is looming.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.833
The I Ching sticks have
made it crystal clear

00:07:25.833 --> 00:07:28.100
that they must stop
this duel immediately.

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:30.833
The cards reveal
an unchangeable dark fate.

00:07:30.833 --> 00:07:33.733
I place one card facedown
and end my turn.

00:07:36.166 --> 00:07:40.100
And now Astromorrigan's
special ability activates,

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:42.100
destroying
all your monsters!

00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:49.166
And 200 points
times 5 totals

00:07:49.166 --> 00:07:51.066
1,000 points
of damage!

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.433
Aah!

00:07:58.466 --> 00:08:00.300
My destroyed
Pendulum Monsters

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:01.666
aren't gone for good.

00:08:01.666 --> 00:08:03.233
They go
to my extra deck.

00:08:03.233 --> 00:08:05.266
I don't think
you get it yet, Yuya.

00:08:05.266 --> 00:08:09.133
I've been warning you because
I'm trying to save you.

00:08:09.133 --> 00:08:11.433
You need to stop
fighting back now,

00:08:11.433 --> 00:08:14.033
or you will never
duel again!

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:19.133
I'm just wasting
my breath.

00:08:19.133 --> 00:08:21.500
So be it‐‐ ha!

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.733
Tarotrei's special
ability activates!

00:08:23.733 --> 00:08:26.300
All my monsters
flip facedown!

00:08:33.866 --> 00:08:35.833
(thinking)
I don't know
what she has planned,

00:08:35.833 --> 00:08:39.066
but my trap Performapal Call
will protect me.

00:08:39.066 --> 00:08:40.966
If I take
a direct attack,

00:08:40.966 --> 00:08:42.533
<i>this card'll block it,</i>

00:08:42.533 --> 00:08:45.400
and I can add two
Performapalsfrom my deck to my
hand

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.233
as long as their
combined defense points

00:08:47.233 --> 00:08:49.800
equal the attacking
monster's attack points.

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.800
Since Petalelf
and Astromorrigan

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:53.433
are face down in
defense mode,

00:08:53.433 --> 00:08:55.533
<i>only Tarotrei can attack.</i>

00:08:55.533 --> 00:08:57.866
And since my trap will
stop that attack,

00:08:57.866 --> 00:09:00.733
I'm swinging
this duel... my way!

00:09:02.066 --> 00:09:05.000
Give up, Yuya.
It's no use.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.533
The longer we duel,
the worse your fate will be.

00:09:08.533 --> 00:09:12.033
This Action Card will
prove I'm right.

00:09:12.033 --> 00:09:13.433
Just as I...

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:16.600
I'm activating

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:19.300
the Action Spell
Lock Draw!

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:21.633
Now, you can't draw
until you send

00:09:21.633 --> 00:09:23.300
one Action Card
to the graveyard!

00:09:24.966 --> 00:09:26.433
This really stinks!

00:09:26.433 --> 00:09:28.300
The card is obviously
commanding you

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:30.033
to stop fighting
and finally accept

00:09:30.033 --> 00:09:31.266
your destiny.

00:09:31.266 --> 00:09:34.500
The only intelligent thing
to do is surrender.

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:37.733
If I quit now,
my dream'll never come true.

00:09:37.733 --> 00:09:40.300
And I'll never
be a pro!

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:42.700
He still won't
believe me.

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:45.633
The only way to save him
is to end this duel quickly.

00:09:45.633 --> 00:09:46.800
But, to do that,

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.533
I first have to prep
my strategy.

00:09:48.533 --> 00:09:49.533
With this!

00:09:51.466 --> 00:09:54.066
(thinking)My facedown card is
the trap Reverse Reuse.

00:09:54.066 --> 00:09:56.233
It summonstwo
Flip Monsters

00:09:56.233 --> 00:09:57.433
<i>that are inmy graveyard</i>

00:09:57.433 --> 00:10:00.233
to Yuya's fieldin
defense mode.

00:10:00.233 --> 00:10:02.300
And once this
trapactivates,

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.633
I can use myPrediction
Princess combo

00:10:04.633 --> 00:10:07.900
to end this duel
beforetragedy befalls him!

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:10.700
And Yuya won't
beharmed in any way.

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:12.766
<i>It is a raceagainst fate,</i>

00:10:12.766 --> 00:10:15.100
<i>one Yuya needs meto win.</i>

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:17.166
Because, if I
fail, Yuya's future will

00:10:17.166 --> 00:10:18.600
<i>come crashing down!</i>

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.466
♪ Sorry, but there won't
be an encore! ♪

00:10:26.466 --> 00:10:29.700

Bye‐bye!

00:10:37.233 --> 00:10:39.233
Aah!

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:45.300
I did it!

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:46.866
My sixth win
in a row!

00:10:46.866 --> 00:10:49.033
Great work!
You finally get to enter

00:10:49.033 --> 00:10:50.933
the Junior Arc League
Championship!

00:10:50.933 --> 00:10:52.800
Well, with my skills,

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.566
getting into the Championship
was never in doubt.

00:10:55.566 --> 00:10:57.066
Sora, I seem to have
misplaced‐‐

00:10:57.066 --> 00:10:58.300
Come on,
we have to hurry

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:00.733
or we'll totally miss
Yuya's duel!

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:07.000
Now, it's my turn!

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.500
You can't draw
until you send

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:09.966
an Action Card
to the graveyard!

00:11:09.966 --> 00:11:11.566
Yeah, I know!

00:11:11.566 --> 00:11:13.133
I'll get one!
Aah!

00:11:17.533 --> 00:11:19.100
I was too late!

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:20.966
I couldn't defeat him
fast enough,

00:11:20.966 --> 00:11:23.866
and now this really will be
the last duel he ever has.

00:11:23.866 --> 00:11:25.300
It's hopeless,

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:27.933
and you're putting yourself
in very serious danger!

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.000
Haah!

00:11:59.533 --> 00:12:00.766
(all shouting)

00:12:09.866 --> 00:12:11.433
(sobbing)

00:12:14.466 --> 00:12:15.833
(all gasping)

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:20.400
I got the the Action
Spell Miracle!

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:21.666
(all)
Yes!

00:12:21.666 --> 00:12:23.366
You did it, Yuya!

00:12:23.366 --> 00:12:24.800
Goosepickles!

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:27.233
This can't be.

00:12:27.233 --> 00:12:29.300
He changed
his destiny.

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:32.200
He ignored the obstacles
and the danger,

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:34.266
and he came up
with a miracle.

00:12:34.266 --> 00:12:36.466
The boy has opened
the path

00:12:36.466 --> 00:12:38.866
to a future
that was closed.

00:12:40.233 --> 00:12:42.600
I send one Action Card
to the graveyard

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:45.333
to unlock Lock Draw.

00:12:45.333 --> 00:12:47.300
It comes down
to this.

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:50.766
One card decides it all.

00:12:50.766 --> 00:12:53.333
I draw!

00:12:55.733 --> 00:12:57.333
(thinking)
<i>Polymerization?</i>

00:12:57.333 --> 00:12:58.800
<i>This is Zuzu's card.</i>

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.433
How'd it get
in my deck?

00:13:00.433 --> 00:13:02.800
Oh! When I was
scrambling,

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.433
and I knocked
the cards off my desk,

00:13:05.433 --> 00:13:09.566
it must've gotten mixed up
with all my cards by
mistake!

00:13:09.566 --> 00:13:12.433
My whole future
depended on this draw!

00:13:14.766 --> 00:13:17.200
Why did I have to get
a card that I can't use?

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.400
Whoa!

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.100
What was that?

00:13:34.766 --> 00:13:37.833
And now,
ladies and gentlemen!

00:13:40.666 --> 00:13:42.933
Scale 1 Stargazer
Magician

00:13:42.933 --> 00:13:44.933
and Scale 8
Timegazer Magician

00:13:44.933 --> 00:13:46.900
are already in
their places!

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:49.933
Now I can summon monsters
from Level 2 through 7

00:13:49.933 --> 00:13:52.433
all at the same time!

00:13:52.433 --> 00:13:54.166
Swing far,
pendulum!

00:13:54.166 --> 00:13:56.466
Carve the arc of victory!

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:02.400
My monsters are ready
to swing into action!

00:14:08.666 --> 00:14:11.233
(roaring)

00:14:11.233 --> 00:14:13.266
Time for an encore
performance!

00:14:13.266 --> 00:14:15.466
Traveling all the way back
from my extra deck,

00:14:15.466 --> 00:14:17.933
give it up
for my monsters!

00:14:17.933 --> 00:14:20.100
Yuya's gonna
put on a show!

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:22.733
Yeah, maybe.

00:14:22.733 --> 00:14:25.666
That was pointless, Yuya!

00:14:25.666 --> 00:14:27.866
Watch and learn
as my Tarotrei

00:14:27.866 --> 00:14:30.600
once again flips over
my facedown monsters!

00:14:32.966 --> 00:14:35.300
Thanks to Petalelf's
special ability,

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:37.100
all the monsters
on your field

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:38.566
switch to defense mode!

00:14:38.566 --> 00:14:40.266
(roaring)

00:14:42.266 --> 00:14:44.333
She's doing
the thing again!

00:14:44.333 --> 00:14:47.633
I'm glad you escaped your
destiny of destruction.

00:14:47.633 --> 00:14:50.866
Now I feel free to defeat you
without holding anything back.

00:14:50.866 --> 00:14:52.366
At the end of this turn,

00:14:52.366 --> 00:14:54.933
Astromorrigan's special
ability will destroy

00:14:54.933 --> 00:14:56.666
all your monsters
in defense mode,

00:14:56.666 --> 00:14:59.366
and you'll take 200 points
of damage for each one!

00:14:59.366 --> 00:15:01.700
You only have
300 life points left,

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:05.300
so, when that happens,
it's all over for you!

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:06.933
You can't defeat me!

00:15:06.933 --> 00:15:09.266
You'll lose this duel
and never make it

00:15:09.266 --> 00:15:12.000
into the Championship!

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.733
Well, we'll see
about that, won't we?

00:15:14.733 --> 00:15:16.666
Huh? See about what?

00:15:16.666 --> 00:15:19.400
First, I activate
Performapal Springgoose's

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:21.066
special ability!

00:15:21.066 --> 00:15:23.066
By banishing it
from my graveyard,

00:15:23.066 --> 00:15:25.800
I can return two cards
on my field to my hand!

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.433
(deep honk)

00:15:27.433 --> 00:15:30.766
So come on back,
StarGazer and Timegazer!

00:15:35.033 --> 00:15:39.233
Next, I tribute
Performapal Kaleidoscorp

00:15:39.233 --> 00:15:41.933
to summon Level 5
Stargazer Magician!

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:51.966
Looks like we got here
just in time.

00:15:51.966 --> 00:15:52.966
And now...

00:15:52.966 --> 00:15:54.966
That card!

00:15:54.966 --> 00:15:58.400
I activate the spell card
Polymerization!

00:15:59.833 --> 00:16:01.000
What's this?

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.433
Yuya's Fusion
Summoning?

00:16:12.366 --> 00:16:14.400
(Yuya)
I fuse Stargazer Magician

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:17.366
and Odd‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon!

00:16:17.366 --> 00:16:18.866
This is it!

00:16:18.866 --> 00:16:20.900
The moment all you
Duel‐tainment fans

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:22.833
have been waiting for
is here!

00:16:22.833 --> 00:16:26.266
Stand up, make way,
and get set to cheer!

00:16:26.266 --> 00:16:29.000
I Fusion Summon!

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.466
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:16:30.466 --> 00:16:32.300
now taking
center stage,

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:34.833
please give it up
for the spotlight‐stealing

00:16:34.833 --> 00:16:37.200
Rune‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon!

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.133
(roaring)

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:49.266
That's... astounding.

00:16:49.266 --> 00:16:51.866
That Dragon's got
3,000 attack points.

00:16:51.866 --> 00:16:53.866
Nice try, Yuya!

00:16:53.866 --> 00:16:55.633
But I still have
more than enough

00:16:55.633 --> 00:16:57.100
life points
to survive!

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:59.233
Hmm, hate to
break it to you,

00:16:59.233 --> 00:17:01.233
but I think your
fortune‐telling days
are over,

00:17:01.233 --> 00:17:02.966
'cause here's
a little something

00:17:02.966 --> 00:17:04.400
you never saw coming.

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:05.900
When I fuse
a Spellcaster

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:07.933
to form Rune‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon,

00:17:07.933 --> 00:17:09.900
the number of times
my Rune‐Eyes can attack

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:11.700
depends on
that monster's Level.

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:13.200
That can't be!

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:16.066
Yuya's fused Odd‐Eyes
with Stargazer Magician!

00:17:16.066 --> 00:17:18.566
Stargazer's a Level 5
Spellcaster!

00:17:18.566 --> 00:17:21.366
And that means
Rune‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon

00:17:21.366 --> 00:17:23.633
can attack you
three times!

00:17:25.733 --> 00:17:28.300
And now
it's showtime!

00:17:43.666 --> 00:17:45.900
(roaring)

00:17:48.066 --> 00:17:50.666
Ready or not,
here I come!

00:17:52.633 --> 00:17:54.400
(roaring)

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.633
Rune‐Eyes!

00:18:02.633 --> 00:18:05.066
Take out
Astromorrigan,

00:18:05.066 --> 00:18:06.866
Petalelf,

00:18:06.866 --> 00:18:09.033
and Tarotrei!

00:18:12.633 --> 00:18:13.633
(gasping)

00:18:13.633 --> 00:18:15.966
Get ready
for my big finale!

00:18:15.966 --> 00:18:18.533
Triple Spiral Skyshot!

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.666
(roaring)

00:18:53.033 --> 00:18:55.933
(Futoshi)
Congratulations!

00:18:55.933 --> 00:18:57.400
Amazing!

00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:00.266
You Fusion Summoned using
a Pendulum Monster!

00:19:00.266 --> 00:19:02.433
It's a Pendulum Fusion!

00:19:02.433 --> 00:19:04.766
Ja,
Pendulum Fusion!

00:19:04.766 --> 00:19:06.400
Goosepickles!

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:08.833
Pendulum Fusion...

00:19:08.833 --> 00:19:11.000
That was awesomely
awesome, Yuya!

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.166
You just performed
a totally perfect

00:19:13.166 --> 00:19:14.200
Fusion Summon,

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.833
and I didn't even
teach it to you.

00:19:15.833 --> 00:19:18.800
Thanks, I got lucky,
I guess.

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:21.500
Where did you get
that Polymerization from?

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:23.700
It's yours.

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:26.900
Sorry, but it got mixed up
in my deck by accident.

00:19:30.233 --> 00:19:32.533
Here, it's all yours.

00:19:32.533 --> 00:19:34.800
You've been training
so hard with Sora,

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:36.633
I couldn't imagine
you not having this

00:19:36.633 --> 00:19:38.100
for the Championship!

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:39.766
And you're
gonna need it.

00:19:39.766 --> 00:19:42.566
Cause' after I win
my next duel,

00:19:42.566 --> 00:19:44.366
you might
have to face me,

00:19:44.366 --> 00:19:45.800
and I won't be
holding back

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:48.900
my Pendulum power,
that's a promise!

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:50.466
(giggles)

00:19:55.766 --> 00:19:56.933
Aah!

00:19:56.933 --> 00:19:58.433
There's my duelmate!

00:19:58.433 --> 00:20:00.233
Ha‐ha!

00:20:00.233 --> 00:20:01.866
Duelmate?

00:20:01.866 --> 00:20:04.533
I knew my prediction powers
wouldn't steer me wrong!

00:20:04.533 --> 00:20:07.566
You are my duelmate,
Yuya‐booya!

00:20:07.566 --> 00:20:10.566
Oh, my fortune
really came true!

00:20:10.566 --> 00:20:14.600
Yuya, why is your opponent
calling you her "duelmate?"

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:18.033
Well, you see, it's kind of
a long story, Zuzu!

00:20:18.033 --> 00:20:20.266
Ohh, you're such a cutie!

00:20:20.266 --> 00:20:23.066
Just tell her.

00:20:23.066 --> 00:20:24.866
Tell her how...
Yuya?!

00:20:24.866 --> 00:20:27.433
Zuzu, y' gotta
let me explain!

00:20:27.433 --> 00:20:29.600
We are meant
for each other...

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.533
It's our destiny!

00:20:31.533 --> 00:20:34.133
Destiny?
I'll show you destiny!

00:20:34.133 --> 00:20:35.500
Zuzu, no,
don't listen!

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:38.066
(thinking)
For one who creates
his own path,

00:20:38.066 --> 00:20:40.933
any kind of
destiny can await.

00:20:40.933 --> 00:20:43.533
Help, help!

00:20:43.533 --> 00:20:45.033
What's this?

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:50.300
Get back here,
you two‐faced...

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:52.633
(shouting over each other)

00:20:54.366 --> 00:20:57.666
Yuya‐kins, I want you to meet
mom and dad right away.

00:20:57.666 --> 00:21:00.600
Ooh, where should
we have the wedding?

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:03.466
Preferably somewhere with
an escape hatch!

00:23:06.433 --> 00:23:09.433
