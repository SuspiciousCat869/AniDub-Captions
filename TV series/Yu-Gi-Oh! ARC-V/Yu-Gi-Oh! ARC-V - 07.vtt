All we mean, Sylvio,

00:01:30.566 --> 00:01:35.433
is that he did beat
you in your last match...

00:01:35.433 --> 00:01:38.400
Because he had better
cards, that's why!

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.500
His deck was stacked
against me from the get go,

Yeah, don't
you remember?

Before the duel, you
took Yuya's Pendulum cards

full of duds!

I guess when you
put it that way!

How about we feed
you personally.

What are we doing
here, Zuzu?

Seriously, Sylvio, you
call that eating?

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.800
Maybe you should try
getting some in your mouth.

gonna be?

Know why?

00:06:03.667 --> 00:06:04.867
Because that...

00:06:04.867 --> 00:06:06.834
Would be insulting
to a chicken!

You look scared.

Now which of us
is chicken?

00:06:35.197 --> 00:06:36.863
If we're going
strictly by appearances,

00:06:36.863 --> 00:06:38.430
then it's still you,
'cause, I've seen

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:42.163
your bird brain abilities
in action against Yuya.

00:06:42.163 --> 00:06:45.030
We'll see who's crying
fowl when this is over!

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:46.963
Now let's
get dueling!

Hope I'm not
interrupting.

00:07:04.497 --> 00:07:07.430
And...
you are?

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:10.830
Someone on a very
special mission.

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:14.930
A mission that I will
complete no matter what.

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:16.463
Yeah, that's great
and all...

00:07:16.463 --> 00:07:18.730
But can't you see we're
in the middle of something?

Yes... We are.

00:07:27.897 --> 00:07:30.263
Never seen a duel
disk like that...

00:07:30.263 --> 00:07:33.663
Okay, so then I guess
you'll be dueling for Zuzu?

00:07:33.663 --> 00:07:35.663
He most certainly
will not be!

00:07:35.663 --> 00:07:37.530
This is my
battle to fight,

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:42.497
and I fully plan
on fighting it‐‐

00:07:42.497 --> 00:07:46.197
I've already put
you through enough.

00:07:46.197 --> 00:07:48.230
Huh?

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:49.797
All righty
then...

00:07:49.797 --> 00:07:51.863
Let's do this,
Mr. Mystery.

00:07:51.863 --> 00:07:54.263
But once I win, you
gotta remove that mask.

00:07:56.797 --> 00:08:01.197
I'll just go ahead and take
your brooding silence as a yes.

00:08:01.197 --> 00:08:03.097
Now then,
ready or not...

00:08:07.097 --> 00:08:07.997
Let's duel!
Let's duel.

00:08:09.197 --> 00:08:11.297
I'll go first.

00:08:11.297 --> 00:08:13.063
By all means.

00:08:13.063 --> 00:08:16.497
I place all five cards
in my hand facedown.

00:08:19.097 --> 00:08:20.863
(gasping)

00:08:20.863 --> 00:08:22.797
I end my turn.

00:08:24.563 --> 00:08:26.030
(murmuring)

00:08:28.163 --> 00:08:30.130
(shuddering then laughing)

00:08:31.563 --> 00:08:33.663
I love it, you show up
all cool and mysterious

00:08:33.663 --> 00:08:35.463
and then play a lame
move like that?

00:08:35.463 --> 00:08:39.063
He couldn't even
summon a single monster!

00:08:39.063 --> 00:08:41.963
I mean, seriously, no wonder
this punk's wearing a mask!

00:08:41.963 --> 00:08:43.897
He's too embarrassed
to show his face!

00:08:43.897 --> 00:08:46.197
C'mon, admit it,
that's the reason!

00:08:46.197 --> 00:08:49.430
Guess you'll have to
beat me to find out.

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:50.963
Fine.

00:08:50.963 --> 00:08:53.363
♪

00:08:54.463 --> 00:08:55.497
Yuya!

00:08:55.497 --> 00:08:57.997
Whoa...

00:08:57.997 --> 00:09:00.397
What's the
big hurry, Allie?

00:09:00.397 --> 00:09:02.763
I had to get to you quick,
there's big trouble!

00:09:02.763 --> 00:09:04.963
I'll say,
the ice cream's melted.

00:09:04.963 --> 00:09:06.097
No prob.

00:09:06.097 --> 00:09:07.530
Anyone have
a straw?

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:09.630
Trouble?
What kind of trouble, Allie?

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:10.963
Where's Zuzu?

00:09:10.963 --> 00:09:12.830
She went after
Sylvio...

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:15.163
She went to duel
him to protect you!

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:22.230
All right, then.

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:24.030
It's time to show you
how it's done...

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:25.363
My turn!

00:09:25.363 --> 00:09:27.497
Draw!

00:09:27.497 --> 00:09:28.730
First, I think
I'll take advantage

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:30.163
of your facedown
cards...

00:09:33.263 --> 00:09:35.363
After all, since you
have two or more cards

00:09:35.363 --> 00:09:37.663
in your Spell and
Trap Card Zone,

00:09:37.663 --> 00:09:41.597
I can summon this chillin'
villain straight from my hand!

00:09:41.597 --> 00:09:44.197
Introducing Escher
the Frost Vassal!

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:47.363
But I'm not done...

00:09:47.363 --> 00:09:48.930
Now I'll tribute Escher
for this cool customer!

00:09:53.197 --> 00:09:56.130
Make way for Mobius
the Frost Monarch!

00:09:58.097 --> 00:09:59.597
All right!

00:09:59.597 --> 00:10:01.163
The duel just started and
Sylvio's already got

00:10:01.163 --> 00:10:02.830
a big time monster out!

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:05.030
With a big time ability!

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:07.863
You see, when Mobius is
successfully summoned,

00:10:07.863 --> 00:10:09.930
I can select up to
two spell and trap cards

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:11.697
on the field and freeze
them out!

00:10:18.297 --> 00:10:19.863
And unfortunately for you,

00:10:19.863 --> 00:10:22.530
I'm just getting
started because next...

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:25.630
I activate the spell
Tribute Carnival!

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:27.730
Now, since I've already
successfully executed

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:32.630
a Tribute Summon, I can
Tribute Summon once again!

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:34.163
And here I always thought
that carnivals

00:10:34.163 --> 00:10:36.063
were supposed to be fun....

00:10:36.063 --> 00:10:38.563
I gotta bad feeling
about what's coming next...

00:10:38.563 --> 00:10:39.797
And you ought to!

00:10:39.797 --> 00:10:41.163
But, please...

00:10:41.163 --> 00:10:43.230
Don't just take
my word for it...

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:45.197
See for yourself!

00:10:45.197 --> 00:10:47.397
Mobius the Frost Monarch,
farewell!

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:54.330
And now rise,
Mobius the Mega Monarch!

00:10:57.930 --> 00:10:59.230
I know what you're
thinking...

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:02.030
Shouldn't I have had to
tribute summon two monsters

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:05.763
to bring out someone as powerful
and majestic as Mega Monarch?

00:11:05.763 --> 00:11:07.430
Nope, because since
my Frost Monarch

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:09.130
was tribute
summoned himself...

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:12.297
He was able to handle the
job all by his lonesome.

00:11:12.297 --> 00:11:14.063
(everyone)
Uh‐Oh!

00:11:14.063 --> 00:11:16.230
And it's only going to be
getting worse for you because

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:19.630
now Mobius the Mega Monarch's
special ability activates!

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:21.597
When he's successfully
summoned, I get to select

00:11:21.597 --> 00:11:23.597
up to three spell and trap
cards on the field

00:11:23.597 --> 00:11:25.397
and then destroy them!

00:11:25.397 --> 00:11:26.330
Nice!

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:27.430
Hurry up though!

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:29.030
Those cards
you're gonna destroy...

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:31.130
They could still
activate!

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:33.163
Actually, that's
the best part, you see,

00:11:33.163 --> 00:11:35.330
since I tributed a Water
Attribute monster

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:37.897
to summon Mega Monarch,
those cards on the field...

00:11:37.897 --> 00:11:39.730
Can't do a thing!

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:43.063
That is, except get
snow blown to bits!

00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:51.163
Hey...

00:11:51.163 --> 00:11:52.997
I can actually
feel the cold...

00:11:52.997 --> 00:11:54.797
But that can't be...

00:11:54.797 --> 00:11:57.130
Unless the action in
this duel is a lot more real

00:11:57.130 --> 00:11:58.030
than I thought!

00:12:18.862 --> 00:12:22.262
Having second thoughts about
this duel now, Mr. Mystery?

00:12:22.262 --> 00:12:24.495
You have no facedowns
on the field

00:12:24.495 --> 00:12:27.995
and no monsters to protect
your precious life points.

00:12:27.995 --> 00:12:31.662
In the future, maybe you should
let Zuzu fight her own battles.

00:12:31.662 --> 00:12:34.195
Look, as much as I
hate to agree with Sylvio...

00:12:34.195 --> 00:12:36.362
He happens to have
a point here.

00:12:36.362 --> 00:12:37.495
Why don't you just
let me take over the‐‐

00:12:41.562 --> 00:12:44.229
I hate to interrupt
your little moment...

00:12:44.229 --> 00:12:46.595
But we're in the middle
of duel if you recall?

00:12:46.595 --> 00:12:50.062
And it was just
getting good...

00:12:50.062 --> 00:12:51.529
Mobius!

00:12:51.529 --> 00:12:53.795
Attack Mr. Mystery
directly!

00:12:53.795 --> 00:12:55.729
Maybe then
he'll see my point!

00:13:05.229 --> 00:13:08.362
I activate the spell card The
Phantom Knights of Shadow Veil

00:13:08.362 --> 00:13:10.129
from my graveyard.

00:13:10.129 --> 00:13:11.429
(everyone)
He did what?

00:13:11.429 --> 00:13:12.462
The graveyard?

00:13:12.462 --> 00:13:14.195
How can he do that?

00:13:14.195 --> 00:13:15.762
Yeah, if a card's
in the graveyard

00:13:15.762 --> 00:13:17.162
you can't use it unless‐‐

00:13:17.162 --> 00:13:20.262
Unless you trigger that card's
effect like you just did

00:13:20.262 --> 00:13:22.529
by declaring
a direct attack.

00:13:22.529 --> 00:13:25.129
Now since I have three of
these cards in my graveyard,

00:13:25.129 --> 00:13:27.362
I can summon three monsters
to the field!

00:13:33.095 --> 00:13:35.662
I think maybe we
underestimated this guy.

00:13:35.662 --> 00:13:37.462
I don't know what's
more mysterious,

00:13:37.462 --> 00:13:38.929
who the man
behind the mask is,

00:13:38.929 --> 00:13:41.362
or the way that
he duels.

00:13:41.362 --> 00:13:42.495
Fine.

00:13:42.495 --> 00:13:43.862
So you've got three
monsters on the field

00:13:43.862 --> 00:13:46.062
but it doesn't change
a single thing!

00:13:46.062 --> 00:13:47.862
Do you
wanna know why?

00:13:47.862 --> 00:13:49.095
'Cause...

00:13:49.095 --> 00:13:50.662
They're not going to
be there for long!

00:13:50.662 --> 00:13:52.529
Mobius
the Mega Monarch!

00:13:52.529 --> 00:13:54.629
Attack that first
Shadow Veil!

00:13:55.995 --> 00:13:58.595
Sleet Spike Smash!

00:13:58.595 --> 00:14:01.129
When Shadow Veil is
destroyed, it is banished

00:14:01.129 --> 00:14:04.129
instead of placed
in the graveyard.

00:14:04.129 --> 00:14:06.395
And that's what's
gonna happen to 'em all!

00:14:06.395 --> 00:14:08.362
In due time,
of course.

00:14:08.362 --> 00:14:10.329
But for now, I'll
throw a facedown.

00:14:10.329 --> 00:14:12.395
And end my turn.

00:14:12.395 --> 00:14:15.862
You survived this round, but you
won't survive this next one.

00:14:15.862 --> 00:14:18.229
That's right,
you tell him, Sylvio!

00:14:18.229 --> 00:14:22.095
I won't need to,
I'm ending this now.

00:14:22.095 --> 00:14:23.729
Say what?

00:14:23.729 --> 00:14:27.162
If you don't believe me,
just watch!

00:14:27.162 --> 00:14:30.229
And watch closely because
there are better ways to learn

00:14:30.229 --> 00:14:34.562
the truth about someone than by
simply seeing their face.

00:14:34.562 --> 00:14:37.629
You can learn
quite a bit more...

00:14:37.629 --> 00:14:40.262
By seeing the passion
of their play.

00:14:40.262 --> 00:14:41.762
Passion of
their play?

00:14:41.762 --> 00:14:43.462
What a complete
loser!

00:14:43.462 --> 00:14:44.829
That guy's
too much!

00:14:44.829 --> 00:14:47.462
I mean, seriously,
who talks like that?

00:14:47.462 --> 00:14:51.362
Someone who understands dueling
in a way you all never will.

00:14:51.362 --> 00:14:56.295
Someone who duels for
more than just themselves.

00:14:56.295 --> 00:14:59.229
I overlay my two
Level 4 Phantom Knights

00:14:59.229 --> 00:15:01.329
in order to build
the Overlay Network!

00:15:04.995 --> 00:15:06.129
It can't be!

00:15:06.129 --> 00:15:07.229
What is it?

00:15:07.229 --> 00:15:08.695
(man)
It is like me.

00:15:08.695 --> 00:15:11.295
Cloaked in shadows and
relentless in its objective.

00:15:11.295 --> 00:15:13.262
Only, its objective
is to destroy!

00:15:15.295 --> 00:15:19.729
I Xyz Summon...
Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon!

00:15:25.062 --> 00:15:27.062
I can't believe
what I'm seeing!

00:15:30.795 --> 00:15:32.329
(clapping)

00:15:34.562 --> 00:15:36.362
Very impressive,
Mr. Mystery,

00:15:36.362 --> 00:15:37.929
but this
changes nothing.

00:15:37.929 --> 00:15:39.262
You see...

00:15:39.262 --> 00:15:43.629
A monster is only as powerful
as its attack points say it is.

00:15:43.629 --> 00:15:45.095
So you do the math.

00:15:45.095 --> 00:15:47.929
Your Rebellion Dragon
has just 2,500...

00:15:47.929 --> 00:15:51.195
And my monster, Mobius
The Mega Monarch has 2,800!

00:15:53.895 --> 00:15:55.762
Rebellion Dragon
is outmatched...

00:15:55.762 --> 00:15:59.362
Your Xyz Summon
was a waste of time.

00:15:59.362 --> 00:16:02.162
Your Dragon's about to
get the royal treatment!

00:16:14.895 --> 00:16:20.261
A monster is only as powerful as
its attack points say it is...

00:16:20.261 --> 00:16:22.028
Rebellion Dragon
is outmatched...

00:16:22.028 --> 00:16:25.661
Your Xyz Summon
was a waste of time.

00:16:25.661 --> 00:16:27.995
And your time is
running out, Sylvio,

00:16:27.995 --> 00:16:29.495
because you're
wrong.

00:16:29.495 --> 00:16:31.828
An Xyz Monster's true
power doesn't reside

00:16:31.828 --> 00:16:34.661
in its attack points
but in something else...

00:16:34.661 --> 00:16:37.128
Fine, then, I'll go on
and take the bait...

00:16:37.128 --> 00:16:38.728
Where is its power?

00:16:38.728 --> 00:16:40.861
It's in
Overlay Units.

00:16:40.861 --> 00:16:42.261
By using one,

00:16:42.261 --> 00:16:45.028
Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon's
special ability activates!

00:16:46.861 --> 00:16:49.361
Now until the end of this
turn, the attack points

00:16:49.361 --> 00:16:53.395
of one Level 5‐or‐above monster
on your field are cut in half!

00:16:57.128 --> 00:17:00.328
And then Dark Rebellion
Xyz Dragon gains that amount

00:17:00.328 --> 00:17:03.761
in its attack points.

00:17:03.761 --> 00:17:04.961
Oh no...

00:17:04.961 --> 00:17:07.295
Now Mobius the Monarch is
the one who's outmatched!

00:17:07.295 --> 00:17:08.995
And Sylvio
can't believe it!

00:17:08.995 --> 00:17:11.828
I can't
believe it!

00:17:11.828 --> 00:17:13.028
Believe it.

00:17:13.028 --> 00:17:14.328
And I'm not done.

00:17:14.328 --> 00:17:16.695
I now use the remaining
Overlay Unit and activate

00:17:16.695 --> 00:17:20.128
Dark Rebellion Dragon's
special ability once again!

00:17:20.128 --> 00:17:21.528
So he's doing
the same thing...

00:17:21.528 --> 00:17:22.895
All over again?

00:17:22.895 --> 00:17:24.428
(everyone)
Not good!

00:17:24.428 --> 00:17:26.328
Go Rebellion Dragon!

00:17:31.528 --> 00:17:33.961
4,600
attack points?

00:17:33.961 --> 00:17:37.128
I still can't
believe this!

00:17:37.128 --> 00:17:41.095
And now, Dark Rebellion
Xyz Dragon

00:17:41.095 --> 00:17:44.295
will attack Mobius
The Mega Monarch!

00:17:44.295 --> 00:17:46.095
Go Mauling
Mandible Charge!

00:17:58.828 --> 00:18:00.328
(groaning)

00:18:06.361 --> 00:18:08.761
(shattering and exploding)

00:18:19.528 --> 00:18:21.761
Whoa... Is it
just me,

00:18:21.761 --> 00:18:22.961
or did that
Dragon's attack

00:18:22.961 --> 00:18:25.728
kinda feel like it really
just happened?

00:18:25.728 --> 00:18:27.628
Yeah, like it was
an Action duel...

00:18:27.628 --> 00:18:29.595
But there's no
ARC system here!

00:18:29.595 --> 00:18:30.928
I wanna go home.

00:18:35.128 --> 00:18:36.428
What's going
on here?

00:18:36.428 --> 00:18:37.628
Who are you?

00:18:37.628 --> 00:18:41.361
I'll be the one
asking the questions now.

00:18:41.361 --> 00:18:45.195
This badge is from
the Leo Institute, is it not?

00:18:45.195 --> 00:18:48.228
What's your connection
to Duel Academy?

00:18:48.228 --> 00:18:50.028
Duel Academy?

00:18:50.028 --> 00:18:51.328
Sorry,
you lost me.

00:18:51.328 --> 00:18:52.795
Don't play dumb!

00:18:52.795 --> 00:18:54.161
I'm not playing!

00:18:54.161 --> 00:18:57.028
Everyone who enrolls in the Leo
Institute has a badge like that!

00:18:57.028 --> 00:18:59.728
As for Duel Academy, I don't
know what you're talking about.

00:18:59.728 --> 00:19:00.995
Is that a place?
A thing?

00:19:00.995 --> 00:19:03.261
What?

00:19:03.261 --> 00:19:04.961
You're of
no use to me.

00:19:07.461 --> 00:19:10.328
Nice try, but this
duel's not over yet!

00:19:10.328 --> 00:19:11.595
I play a trap!

00:19:11.595 --> 00:19:15.528
Ice Rage!

00:19:15.528 --> 00:19:17.761
And this ought to make you
angry, 'cause now the monster

00:19:17.761 --> 00:19:21.628
that destroyed my Water monster
in battle goes bye‐bye!

00:19:21.628 --> 00:19:23.595
And then you take damage
to your life points

00:19:23.595 --> 00:19:28.461
equal to that
monster's attack points!

00:19:28.461 --> 00:19:30.628
They say that your greatest
strength can sometimes be

00:19:30.628 --> 00:19:33.495
your greatest weakness, and in
this case I'd say they're right

00:19:33.495 --> 00:19:35.361
because the numbers
don't lie!

00:19:35.361 --> 00:19:37.061
(laughing)

00:19:37.061 --> 00:19:38.995
4,600!

00:19:38.995 --> 00:19:41.061
That's the amount of
damage you'll be taking

00:19:41.061 --> 00:19:43.528
to your life points!

00:19:43.528 --> 00:19:44.561
No.

00:19:44.561 --> 00:19:45.995
It won't be.

00:19:45.995 --> 00:19:47.428
What?

00:19:47.428 --> 00:19:51.795
I activate the spell Phantom
Spear from my graveyard.

00:19:51.795 --> 00:19:55.695
Since you activated a trap card,
by banishing Phantom Spear,

00:19:55.695 --> 00:19:59.328
your trap activation is
negated and the trap destroyed!

00:20:03.761 --> 00:20:08.028
And then, you take
100 points of damage.

00:20:08.028 --> 00:20:09.028
(shrieking)

00:20:10.528 --> 00:20:12.728
Wait, time out, hold on a sec,
can't we talk about this?

00:20:12.728 --> 00:20:14.328
Maybe negotiate
a truce?

00:20:14.328 --> 00:20:15.495
No.

00:20:15.495 --> 00:20:18.295
You wanted to finish
the duel, so I'm finishing it.

00:20:32.261 --> 00:20:36.095
And since you still seem to
be blind as to who I am...

00:20:44.995 --> 00:20:46.361
Yuya?

00:20:46.361 --> 00:20:47.628
Huh?

00:20:47.628 --> 00:20:49.861
I think I need
to sit down.

00:20:49.861 --> 00:20:51.628
Uh, that's
falling down.

00:20:51.628 --> 00:20:52.861
Yeah...

00:20:52.861 --> 00:20:55.895
Now let's all fall
back, way back!

00:20:58.395 --> 00:21:03.061
Yuya, I don't understand...
how'd you get here so fast?

00:21:03.061 --> 00:21:07.961
And why... are you all
dressed up in this disguise?

00:21:07.961 --> 00:21:09.095
Huh?

00:21:09.095 --> 00:21:10.695
What's happening?

00:21:10.695 --> 00:21:11.928
Uh...

00:21:15.028 --> 00:21:16.595
Yuya?

00:21:16.595 --> 00:21:17.561
Hello?

00:21:17.561 --> 00:21:18.761
Where'd
you go?

00:21:18.761 --> 00:21:20.528
Zuzu!

00:21:20.528 --> 00:21:21.895
Huh?

00:21:21.895 --> 00:21:23.161
What in the‐‐

00:21:23.161 --> 00:21:24.795
There you are!
Are you okay?

00:21:24.795 --> 00:21:26.095
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:21:26.095 --> 00:21:27.128
Thanks to you.

00:21:27.128 --> 00:21:29.295
You were here.

00:21:29.295 --> 00:21:30.828
What do you
mean here?

00:21:30.828 --> 00:21:32.228
Here when?

00:21:32.228 --> 00:21:34.361
So strange...
Was that Yuya?

00:21:34.361 --> 00:21:38.095
I just...
don't know...

00:21:38.095 --> 00:21:39.761
You feeling
okay, Zuzu?

00:21:39.761 --> 00:21:41.828
Maybe you oughta
get some fresh air.

00:21:41.828 --> 00:21:43.861
It kinda smells
like smoke in here.

00:21:43.861 --> 00:21:46.061
Of course, that's still an
improvement over the smell

00:21:46.061 --> 00:21:49.361
of Frederick's pralines
and currywurst ice cream!

00:21:49.361 --> 00:21:50.561
Ew‐yuck!

00:23:30.328 --> 00:23:33.128
