WEBVTT

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.233
Earth calling Yuya!

00:00:04.233 --> 00:00:06.500
You're looking
a bit "spaced out"
this morning!

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.800
Oh, I guess
I'm still sleepy...

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.033
You'd better jump start
those neurons, buster!

00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:16.700
(thinking)
I wish I could,
but they're exhausted

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.400
from thinking about that
masked duelist...

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.700
<i>Who is he?</i>

00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:25.066
This is going to be
a big day!

00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:27.533
I just hope you have
your trivia hat ready!

00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:29.833
Huh? Trivia?

00:00:31.033 --> 00:00:32.433
(Host)Correct! Now
we'll move on

00:00:32.433 --> 00:00:34.766
to "Food Facts"for
ten points!

00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:36.566
Here's the question.
What kind of fruit

00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:39.966
is red and used
to make sauce for pasta?

00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:42.866
(ringing)
An apple, of course!

00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:44.366
Pierre,
what's your answer?

00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:46.066
A tomato!

00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:47.333
Correct again!

00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:48.666
I'm wrong?

00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:51.000
Not a big surprise since
you're always wrong.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.133
But apples are
red fruit!

00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:55.500
And you use them
to make apple sauce!

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.433
He said sauce
for pasta.

00:00:57.433 --> 00:01:01.066
Yeah. Spaghetti
and apple sauce
is the best!

00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:03.000
Next question!
What is Earth's di‐‐

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.933
(ringing)
Pierre!

00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:08.200
7,918 miles!

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.833
Correct again!

00:01:09.833 --> 00:01:11.133
The complete
question was,

00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:12.800
"What is Earth's
diameter?"

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.733
Let's hear it for
Pierre L'Supérieure,

00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:18.666
the Quiz Wiz
Extraordinaire!

00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:20.666
Amazing!
That kid must have

00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:22.400
a big brain
in his noggin!

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.133
Pierre's a genius!

00:01:24.133 --> 00:01:26.266
He won every quiz show
he ever appeared on!

00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:27.633
Nobody even
knows his IQ,

00:01:27.633 --> 00:01:29.433
because it's so far
off the charts,

00:01:29.433 --> 00:01:30.733
it can't be
measured!

00:01:30.733 --> 00:01:32.600
Just the opposite
of someone I know.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.066
Really?
Someone's that unsmart?

00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:36.666
So tell us, Pierre,

00:01:36.666 --> 00:01:39.566
how did you acquire
your knack for trivia?

00:01:39.566 --> 00:01:41.600
It's thanks
to hard work and study!

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.866
The brain must be
exercised every day,

00:01:43.866 --> 00:01:45.900
just like we exercise
our bodies!

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.433
There is nothing sadder

00:01:48.433 --> 00:01:50.533
than a flabby,
out‐of‐shape brain,

00:01:50.533 --> 00:01:52.466
especially in
a duelist!

00:01:52.466 --> 00:01:54.033
Call me crazy,
but I think

00:01:54.033 --> 00:01:55.666
Pierre's
referring to you.

00:01:55.666 --> 00:01:58.233
Yeah, well, I work out
my brain all the time!

00:01:58.233 --> 00:02:00.500
The only thing
you think about all day

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.433
is how to avoid
thinking!

00:02:02.433 --> 00:02:04.500
How do you like that?

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.233
Answer a few dozen
trivia questions wrong,

00:02:07.233 --> 00:02:10.500
and suddenly everyone thinks
you're an ignoramoose!

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.300
Anyway,
it's impossible

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.966
to be brilliant at
everything!

00:02:13.966 --> 00:02:16.566
When it comes to dueling,
I'm already a genius,

00:02:16.566 --> 00:02:18.500
and that's
good enough for me!

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.000
As one genius to another,
I heartily agree!

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.700
Thank you!

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.266
Stick with me, and there's
nowhere to go but up!

00:02:25.266 --> 00:02:27.000
That hurt.

Better shake a leg!

00:03:38.566 --> 00:03:39.900
Nico...

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.700
What're we doing here?

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.466
Clarity Prep is one of the best
schools in the country!

00:03:44.466 --> 00:03:46.300
It certainly is!

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.133
Many of the world's
top movers and shakers

00:03:48.133 --> 00:03:50.200
have graduated from
this institution!

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.766
Politicians,
business elites,

00:03:51.766 --> 00:03:54.300
reality TV
producers.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.666
This place
churns out winners

00:03:55.666 --> 00:03:57.533
like a cat can
churn out hairballs!

00:03:57.533 --> 00:03:59.666
Really?
And they also

00:03:59.666 --> 00:04:02.400
happen to produce some of
today's most talented
duelists!

00:04:05.266 --> 00:04:06.700
(voice)
What part of our bodies has

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.833
the power to move
mountains?

00:04:08.833 --> 00:04:10.300
(all)
Our muscles!

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.433
(all gasping)

00:04:11.433 --> 00:04:13.466
You're wrong!

00:04:13.466 --> 00:04:16.800
The correct answer...
is the human brain!

00:04:20.966 --> 00:04:22.466
Hey, aren't you...

00:04:22.466 --> 00:04:25.366
He's Clarity Prep's
star student

00:04:25.366 --> 00:04:26.866
and smartest kid on Earth,

00:04:26.866 --> 00:04:29.033
the one and only
Pierre L'Supérieure,

00:04:29.033 --> 00:04:31.333
Quiz Whiz
Extraordinaire!

00:04:31.333 --> 00:04:32.800
Being an expert
on everything,

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.166
I know
who you are... Yuya.

00:04:35.166 --> 00:04:37.366
I've seen your
Pendulum Summoning,

00:04:37.366 --> 00:04:39.066
and I must say
it left me impressed.

00:04:39.066 --> 00:04:40.466
A pleasure!

00:04:40.466 --> 00:04:41.800
Nice to meet you!

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.066
I just saw
that quiz show

00:04:43.066 --> 00:04:44.433
that you dominated
yesterday!

00:04:44.433 --> 00:04:46.566
I really look forward
to dueling you.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.066
Mind if I ask you
a question

00:04:49.066 --> 00:04:50.733
before we get going?

00:04:50.733 --> 00:04:52.133
A question?

00:04:52.133 --> 00:04:53.666
A moment ago,

00:04:53.666 --> 00:04:55.266
you declared
that it was nice

00:04:55.266 --> 00:04:56.666
to meet me, Yuya.

00:04:56.666 --> 00:04:59.166
But do you know
how to say that in French?

00:04:59.166 --> 00:05:01.900
Uh... that
a trick question?

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.200
There will be
a ten‐second
time limit.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.700
Ten seconds?

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.566
Umm, my French is
kinda rusty...

00:05:08.566 --> 00:05:12.133
Nice‐a‐voo‐tay...
to see voo‐play?

00:05:12.133 --> 00:05:13.466
You're wrong!

00:05:13.466 --> 00:05:17.666
The answer is"Je suis enchantée
de faire votre connaisance!"

00:05:17.666 --> 00:05:19.266
(all)
What did he say?

00:05:19.266 --> 00:05:21.300
"Nice to meet you!"

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.500
I myself speak

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.566
over one hundred
foreign languages!

00:05:24.566 --> 00:05:26.633
I bet you don't know
a single tongue

00:05:26.633 --> 00:05:27.966
other than your own.

00:05:27.966 --> 00:05:30.366
(giggling)

00:05:30.366 --> 00:05:32.533
And you do not
speak that well!

00:05:32.533 --> 00:05:34.200
(laughing)

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.800
(all laughing)

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.500
Ha, ha, very funny,
Pierre!

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.200
Stop trying to make me
look like a fool

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.666
in front
of everybody!

00:05:44.666 --> 00:05:46.666
You are doing that
yourself.

00:05:46.666 --> 00:05:49.066
However, I'm willing
to admit you may not

00:05:49.066 --> 00:05:50.400
be horrible
at everything.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.933
I'll have you know...

00:05:51.933 --> 00:05:53.800
I'm good at
a lot of things!

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.900
But what else
are you bad at?

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.033
Other than your French,

00:05:58.033 --> 00:05:59.900
what are
your weaknesses?

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.766
And why should
I tell you!?

00:06:01.766 --> 00:06:03.633
Tell me
your weaknesses,

00:06:03.633 --> 00:06:05.433
and I will share mine
with you.

00:06:05.433 --> 00:06:07.200
(growling)

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.500
I'm not too great
at science or math.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.766
Ahh! What a great
pity for you!

00:06:12.766 --> 00:06:14.033
Your turn!

00:06:14.033 --> 00:06:15.433
Name something
you're bad at!

00:06:15.433 --> 00:06:17.900
You want to know
my weaknesses?

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.566
(giggling)

00:06:19.566 --> 00:06:23.300
I truly do not
have any!

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:24.833
None at all?

00:06:24.833 --> 00:06:26.500
You understood me
correctly!

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.766
I know everything
that there is to know!

00:06:28.766 --> 00:06:31.466
Or to put it
more bluntly,

00:06:31.466 --> 00:06:34.033
I am quite simply
perfect!

00:06:34.033 --> 00:06:37.033
A perfect show‐off!
What's your weakness?

00:06:37.033 --> 00:06:38.600
He speaks the truth.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.733
When it comes
to the world of trivia,

00:06:40.733 --> 00:06:43.633
Pierre has a perfect command
of facts and figures.

00:06:43.633 --> 00:06:45.466
They are all
stored up here,

00:06:45.466 --> 00:06:47.133
in a brain that
makes yours

00:06:47.133 --> 00:06:49.100
look puny
by comparison!

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:50.700
(laughing)

00:06:54.733 --> 00:06:55.966
Attack!

00:06:55.966 --> 00:06:57.800
It's game over!

00:07:00.633 --> 00:07:03.000
That little shrimp
crushed me!

00:07:06.633 --> 00:07:08.333
That's it?

00:07:08.333 --> 00:07:10.066
It was over
so quick!

00:07:10.066 --> 00:07:12.400
Yeah, we barely
started battling!

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:13.700
I'm glad I won,

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.100
but I was hoping for
a bigger challenge.

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:17.400
All right!

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:18.633
(thinking)
<i>No matter what it takes,</i>

00:07:18.633 --> 00:07:20.900
I'm gonna becomeas strong
a duelist as Sora,

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.133
even though it meansI
can't cheer on Yuya

00:07:23.133 --> 00:07:24.833
<i>in his duels!</i>

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:29.000
Apologies for
the long delay,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.833
but this duel will definitely
be worth the wait!

00:07:31.833 --> 00:07:33.233
Today's duel features

00:07:33.233 --> 00:07:35.366
the Quiz Whiz Extraordinaire
himself!

00:07:35.366 --> 00:07:39.400
Let's give it up
for Pierre L'Supérieure!

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.366
What's the greatest power?

00:07:41.366 --> 00:07:43.766
(all)
Brain power!

00:07:43.766 --> 00:07:46.000
His opponent is
none other than

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.400
the jaw‐dropping
dueltainer

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.900
and pioneer
of Pendulum Summoning,

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:53.333
Yuya Sakaki!

00:07:53.333 --> 00:07:56.900
(all)
Get your brain in gear!

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:58.766
Duelists,
prepare for combat!

00:07:58.766 --> 00:08:00.233
You will face‐off...

00:08:00.233 --> 00:08:03.066
in the Action Field
Quiz Quest!

00:08:03.066 --> 00:08:06.100
Our duelists need
every neuron in their brains

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:07.633
to succeed
in this realm!

00:08:07.633 --> 00:08:09.633
It's the field where
the intelligent rule

00:08:09.633 --> 00:08:11.500
and mental slackers
drool!

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.600
You can't cram
for this exam!

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.033
These two contenders
will have to turn

00:08:15.033 --> 00:08:17.000
their knowledge banks
inside‐out

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.200
to survive this round!

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.500
Yuya and Pierre,

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.700
let the battle
of your brains begin!

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:23.733
We're gonna duel
on a quiz field?

00:08:23.733 --> 00:08:26.333
(giggling)
That's correct!

00:08:26.333 --> 00:08:28.600
But I am sure
that is the only thing

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.933
you will get
correct here!

00:08:29.933 --> 00:08:31.833
This field requires
an expertise in

00:08:31.833 --> 00:08:33.266
every facet
of knowledge!

00:08:33.266 --> 00:08:34.500
In other words,

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:37.266
I will dominate
this domain!

00:08:37.266 --> 00:08:39.700
(thinking)
I wonder how Yuya's
dueltaining style

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:42.066
will play in a field
full of questions.

00:08:42.066 --> 00:08:45.366
This should be very
interesting...

00:08:45.366 --> 00:08:47.600
It's time to begin
our no‐holds‐barred,

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.233
brain‐to‐brain brawl!

00:08:49.233 --> 00:08:50.433
A whirlwind
battle of wits

00:08:50.433 --> 00:08:52.500
featuring the Pendulum
Master, Yuya,

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:55.200
against Quiz Whiz
Extraordinaire, Pierre!

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.533
Get set...
...for a trial
by trivia

00:08:57.533 --> 00:08:59.266
that will
leave you breathless!

00:08:59.266 --> 00:09:01.866
Snap to it,
gentlemen!

00:09:01.866 --> 00:09:03.133
(both)
Duel!

00:09:05.533 --> 00:09:07.433
(voice)
<i>Action Cards dispersed.</i>

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:13.000
Let's start
with a question!

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.300
Which of us is going
to take the first turn?

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:18.700
(all)
The answer's you!

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:21.166
Right you are!
I'll go first

00:09:21.166 --> 00:09:24.133
and will demonstrate my genius
by summoning Quiz Monkey!

00:09:27.066 --> 00:09:28.866
He must be
monkeying around.

00:09:28.866 --> 00:09:30.466
It has no attack points!

00:09:30.466 --> 00:09:33.166
And yet many great things
have started from zero

00:09:33.166 --> 00:09:35.866
as surely as
a primate possesses a tail!

00:09:35.866 --> 00:09:37.900
Even a "weak" card
can be dangerous

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:39.366
in the hands
of a mastermind!

00:09:39.366 --> 00:09:40.600
(giggling)

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.400
I could end
the match here,

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.333
but I think
I will toy with you
a little more!

00:09:46.433 --> 00:09:47.866
It's a bluff!

00:09:47.866 --> 00:09:49.866
He's just playing
mind games!

00:09:49.866 --> 00:09:53.433
Yuya, I'm eager to see
your famous Pendulum Summon.

00:09:53.433 --> 00:09:54.966
Unfortunately,
you will not have

00:09:54.966 --> 00:09:58.500
the time to do it
this duel.

00:09:58.500 --> 00:09:59.800
I agree!

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:03.500
See, I plan on keeping
this duel very short!

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:05.766
Front and center,
Performapal Bowhopper!

00:10:06.833 --> 00:10:07.833
Awesome!

00:10:07.833 --> 00:10:08.866
By using that bug,

00:10:08.866 --> 00:10:10.333
he'll get the jump
on Pierre!

00:10:10.333 --> 00:10:11.700
Bowhopper!

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:14.800
Spring at that Monkey
on my mark!

00:10:16.933 --> 00:10:18.700
Get ready to launch...

00:10:20.566 --> 00:10:23.233
Quiz Monkey's special ability
now activates!

00:10:24.766 --> 00:10:27.300
Whenever you engage
Quiz Monkey in battle,

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:28.933
you have to answer
a question.

00:10:28.933 --> 00:10:30.200
And here it is.

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.166
When this battle
reaches the end,

00:10:32.166 --> 00:10:33.933
exactly how many
Quiz monsters

00:10:33.933 --> 00:10:36.533
will remain
on the field?

00:10:36.533 --> 00:10:37.933
Answer correctly,

00:10:37.933 --> 00:10:39.766
and you will be
awarded a prize!

00:10:39.766 --> 00:10:41.633
1,000 life points,
to be exact!

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:45.733
But if you're wrong,
I can summon my Monkey

00:10:45.733 --> 00:10:46.966
from the graveyard.

00:10:46.966 --> 00:10:49.866
And then your Bowhopper
will be destroyed,

00:10:49.866 --> 00:10:52.600
and its attack points
funnel into my monster's

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.666
attack and defense
points.

00:10:56.833 --> 00:10:59.233
Yuya, give me
your answer!

00:10:59.233 --> 00:11:01.700
Uh, lemme think...

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.800
What was
the question again?

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.533
You must
pay attention!

00:11:05.533 --> 00:11:07.833
At the risk of losing
one of your monsters,

00:11:07.833 --> 00:11:09.933
you must tell me
how many Quiz monsters

00:11:09.933 --> 00:11:12.500
will be left on the field after
this battle is done!

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:13.900
That's easy

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:16.566
since your Monkey has
no attack points.

00:11:16.566 --> 00:11:19.300
My Bowhopper is
so powerful in comparison

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:20.633
that it can't lose!

00:11:20.633 --> 00:11:23.766
So the answer is
zero Quiz monsters!

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.133
You have given
your answer.

00:11:28.133 --> 00:11:29.966
Let us see if
you are right or wrong!

00:11:33.633 --> 00:11:36.266
Oh, yeah! My answer was
so right on the mark!

00:11:36.266 --> 00:11:39.000
No! You missed
by a mile!

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.800
Because I am activating
my trap Not So Fast!

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.966
This protects
one Quiz Monster
on my field

00:11:43.966 --> 00:11:46.200
so that it cannot be
destroyed in battle

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.400
and wipes out
any damage I would take!

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:50.766
My Monkey remains
happily unharmed!

00:11:50.766 --> 00:11:53.533
(all gasping)
The battle is over!

00:11:53.533 --> 00:11:55.666
Now it's time
to assess the damage.

00:11:55.666 --> 00:11:58.766
Yuya said there would be
no Quiz monsters left.

00:11:58.766 --> 00:12:00.966
Ooh‐la‐la!

00:12:00.966 --> 00:12:04.600
It appears one Quiz monster
still remains on my field!

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.933
Which means...
you were wrong!

00:12:07.933 --> 00:12:09.800
You shall be
penalized!

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:11.966
Say au revoir
to your Bowhopper!

00:12:15.433 --> 00:12:17.100
Your Bowhopper's loss

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:19.200
now becomes
Quiz Monkey's gain!

00:12:20.333 --> 00:12:21.466
Uh‐oh!

00:12:21.466 --> 00:12:23.166
What a silly boy I am!

00:12:23.166 --> 00:12:26.100
I thought Yuya was right,
but the correct answer was one!

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:29.266
No. It was
a trick question.

00:12:29.266 --> 00:12:31.766
If Yuya really had
answered one,

00:12:31.766 --> 00:12:34.100
then Pierre would have let
his monster be destroyed

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:36.300
and not used
his trap.

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:39.966
So then I would've been wrong
no matter what answer I gave!

00:12:39.966 --> 00:12:42.800
Correct!
I outsmarted you!

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.466
You may as well accept that
since this is a duel of wits,

00:12:45.466 --> 00:12:47.233
you cannot possibly
defeat me!

00:12:47.233 --> 00:12:49.633
I will always be
one step ahead of you,

00:12:49.633 --> 00:12:51.066
since I am so smart,

00:12:51.066 --> 00:12:53.600
far smarter than
a raisin‐brain like you,

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.700
Monsieur Yuya!
(laughing)

00:13:01.833 --> 00:13:04.100
I dare you
to attack me!

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:06.600
I can't now.
Your move, Pierre.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:09.400
Then I'll kick off my turn
with another question!

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:12.066
Can you name the nitwit
who will take severe damage

00:13:12.066 --> 00:13:14.566
in a direct attack
during this turn?

00:13:14.566 --> 00:13:16.100
Well, can you?

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:17.833
(growling)

00:13:17.833 --> 00:13:19.433
Oh, come now!

00:13:19.433 --> 00:13:21.366
This is the easiest
question so far!

00:13:21.366 --> 00:13:23.100
Just look in
the mirror!

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:25.866
You'll see the answer
staring back at you!

00:13:25.866 --> 00:13:27.200
(laughing)

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.166
Running away?

00:13:30.166 --> 00:13:31.533
Good luck!

00:13:34.766 --> 00:13:36.766
I know what
you are up to, Yuya!

00:13:36.766 --> 00:13:38.700
You want to pick up
an Action Card!

00:13:40.466 --> 00:13:41.666
Before you can reach it,

00:13:41.666 --> 00:13:43.400
Quiz Monkey will
attack you directly!

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:47.400
Gotcha!

00:13:51.733 --> 00:13:54.400
Action Trap
activates now!

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:57.533
Commence quiz action!

00:13:57.533 --> 00:13:59.666
Action Trap?

00:13:59.666 --> 00:14:03.166
Yes! This Action Card will
let you escape damage.

00:14:03.166 --> 00:14:05.100
Yes!
But only if you answer

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:07.166
my quiz question
correctly.

00:14:07.166 --> 00:14:09.633
(all)
What, a quiz?

00:14:09.633 --> 00:14:11.266
If you answer
incorrectly,

00:14:11.266 --> 00:14:13.033
however, you will
take the attack damage

00:14:13.033 --> 00:14:15.100
and lose 100 additional
life points.

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:16.533
Ugh!

00:14:16.533 --> 00:14:18.666
When you duel
on the Action Field
Quiz Quest,

00:14:18.666 --> 00:14:21.133
activating Action Cards
is a matter of answering

00:14:21.133 --> 00:14:24.666
trivia questions
correctly or incorrectly!

00:14:24.666 --> 00:14:27.166
It can be an almost
impossible challenge.

00:14:27.166 --> 00:14:29.700
Unless you are a Quiz Whiz
Extraordinaire!

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:31.666
Extraordinarily
annoying!

00:14:31.666 --> 00:14:33.500
And now for
your question!

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:36.100
The category is Science
for 100!

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:37.766
Uh, science?

00:14:37.766 --> 00:14:39.066
Let us begin!

00:14:39.066 --> 00:14:41.466
Observe. There is
a full glass of water

00:14:41.466 --> 00:14:43.266
with an ice cube
floating in it.

00:14:43.266 --> 00:14:45.233
Question.
When the ice cube melts,

00:14:45.233 --> 00:14:48.100
will the water in the glass
remain at the same level,

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:50.266
or will it overflow
from the glass?

00:14:50.266 --> 00:14:53.966
Overflow!
(buzzer)

00:14:53.966 --> 00:14:55.833
Your answer is
incorrect!

00:14:55.833 --> 00:14:58.833
The penalty will
be assessed now!

00:14:58.833 --> 00:15:01.500
Wait!
It's not fair!

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:04.933
Quiz Monkey,
time to go bananas!

00:15:12.833 --> 00:15:14.533
Consider this
a science lesson!

00:15:14.533 --> 00:15:16.433
You just learned
how gravity works!

00:15:16.433 --> 00:15:18.400
(all laughing)

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:20.166
Attention,
everyone!

00:15:20.166 --> 00:15:21.766
Check this move!

00:15:21.766 --> 00:15:23.033
It will
further demonstrate

00:15:23.033 --> 00:15:24.900
my superiority
over Yuya!

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:27.533
One of my Quiz monsters
damaged him in battle,

00:15:27.533 --> 00:15:29.566
so that lets me
summon a card

00:15:29.566 --> 00:15:31.133
that is
a real conundrum!

00:15:31.133 --> 00:15:32.566
Quiz Sphinx!

00:15:32.566 --> 00:15:35.233
As long as there is
a Quiz monster on my field,

00:15:35.233 --> 00:15:36.933
this monster cannot
be attacked!

00:15:36.933 --> 00:15:39.866
You can try, but it would be
a "monumental" mistake!

00:15:39.866 --> 00:15:42.533
Get set! Quiz Sphinx is
going to flatten you

00:15:42.533 --> 00:15:44.400
with Pyramid Power!

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.433
Aah!

00:15:53.233 --> 00:15:54.666
NNFantastique!

00:15:54.666 --> 00:15:56.133
Not only
are you bad at trivia,

00:15:56.133 --> 00:15:57.566
but at dueling
as well!

00:15:57.566 --> 00:15:59.066
(growling)

00:15:59.066 --> 00:16:02.566
Take your turn even though
you cannot beat me!

00:16:02.566 --> 00:16:03.833
(growling)

00:16:03.833 --> 00:16:05.000
Let's find out!

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:09.333
(thinking)Now to answer the
only question that matters.

00:16:09.333 --> 00:16:11.433
Can I pull off an upset
against Pierre

00:16:11.433 --> 00:16:12.866
<i>or not?</i>

00:16:16.633 --> 00:16:18.233
(thinking)
My best hope of taking down
Pierre

00:16:18.233 --> 00:16:19.700
<i>is to get an Action Card,</i>

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:20.833
but that means
I'll have to get

00:16:20.833 --> 00:16:22.566
<i>a trivia question right!</i>

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.666
Hopefully, I'll snag one
with an easy question!

00:16:26.666 --> 00:16:29.333
No matter
how fast you run,

00:16:29.333 --> 00:16:32.100
it will not make
any difference,
ultimately!

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:34.766
Alas, not only
will you lose this race

00:16:34.766 --> 00:16:36.033
to get an Action Card,

00:16:36.033 --> 00:16:38.900
you will be
utterly humiliated!

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:40.666
Huh?
Too late!

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:45.366
Action Trap
activates now!

00:16:45.366 --> 00:16:49.400
Commence quiz action!

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:51.033
Answer correctly,

00:16:51.033 --> 00:16:53.300
and you will win
300 life points!

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:56.666
The category is Trivia
for 300!

00:16:56.666 --> 00:16:58.033
True or false.

00:16:58.033 --> 00:16:59.766
Raccoon and chest
are spelled

00:16:59.766 --> 00:17:01.633
with the same
number of C's.

00:17:01.633 --> 00:17:03.433
False!
Correct!

00:17:03.433 --> 00:17:05.333
Raccoon has two C's.

00:17:07.433 --> 00:17:08.866
And I am sure...

00:17:08.866 --> 00:17:11.466
Yuya has more C's than that
on his report card!

00:17:11.466 --> 00:17:13.466
Why do you get
easy questions?

00:17:13.466 --> 00:17:15.866
Just lucky,
I guess!

00:17:15.866 --> 00:17:17.133
Really lucky!

00:17:17.133 --> 00:17:19.266
Action Trap
activates now!

00:17:19.266 --> 00:17:22.966
If your answer is correct,
you gain 500 life points!

00:17:22.966 --> 00:17:27.466
Okay, the category is Trivia
for 500!

00:17:27.466 --> 00:17:31.333
True or False.
Comedians make great doctors.

00:17:31.333 --> 00:17:32.700
It's true!

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:36.600
Correct! Because laughter
is the best medicine!

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:38.633
(laughing)

00:17:38.633 --> 00:17:40.833
Aw, come on,
that one was easy!

00:17:40.833 --> 00:17:42.500
I am on a roll!

00:17:47.566 --> 00:17:50.533
Action Trap‐‐
Get on with it!

00:17:50.533 --> 00:17:53.533
All right.
If you insist.

00:17:53.533 --> 00:17:55.600
Answer the following
question correctly,

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:58.633
and you will gain
1,000 life points.

00:17:58.633 --> 00:18:02.066
The category is Trivia
for 1,000.

00:18:02.066 --> 00:18:05.066
Where did the car take the man
on the hottest day of the year?

00:18:05.066 --> 00:18:06.600
The car pool!

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:07.833
Correct!

00:18:07.833 --> 00:18:09.000
(Yuya)
All these quizzes!

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.566
It's just like school
except without recess!

00:18:13.766 --> 00:18:16.300
He's racking up life points
like there's no tomorrow!

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:18.333
Pick up the pace, Yuya!

00:18:18.333 --> 00:18:19.633
I'm trying!

00:18:19.633 --> 00:18:21.966
There's gotta be
another card somewhere...

00:18:21.966 --> 00:18:24.733
Ah‐ha!
That card is mine!

00:18:24.733 --> 00:18:27.266
Pierre won't beat me
this time!

00:18:27.266 --> 00:18:28.433
Haa!

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:34.833
Action Trap
activates now!

00:18:34.833 --> 00:18:36.633
Answer the question
correctly,

00:18:36.633 --> 00:18:39.366
and you will gain
100 additional life points.

00:18:39.366 --> 00:18:41.766
If you are wrong,
you will lose 100.

00:18:41.766 --> 00:18:42.833
I'm ready!

00:18:42.833 --> 00:18:45.466
The category is Math
for 100.

00:18:45.466 --> 00:18:47.533
Sorry?
Did you say math?

00:18:47.533 --> 00:18:49.933
Question.
If pillars were placed

00:18:49.933 --> 00:18:51.633
10 yards apart from
each other,

00:18:51.633 --> 00:18:53.866
how many pillars
would be needed to span

00:18:53.866 --> 00:18:55.900
a distance
of 100 yards?

00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:57.600
What a piece of cake!

00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:00.700
It's 100 divided by 10,
so 10 is the answer!

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:02.633
(buzzer)
Hold on!

00:19:02.633 --> 00:19:05.566
(groaning)

00:19:05.566 --> 00:19:07.166
(laughing)

00:19:07.166 --> 00:19:10.433
The right answer
is 11, genius!

00:19:10.433 --> 00:19:12.366
(all laughing)

00:19:12.366 --> 00:19:14.233
Why can't Yuya stop
and think a little

00:19:14.233 --> 00:19:15.400
before he answers?

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.633
I'll have better luck
this time!

00:19:20.133 --> 00:19:21.166
Perfect!

00:19:23.233 --> 00:19:25.266
Action trap
activates now!

00:19:25.266 --> 00:19:28.133
The category is Math
for 200.

00:19:28.133 --> 00:19:31.033
In this example,
two dice will be rolled.

00:19:31.033 --> 00:19:33.133
The first die
turns up six.

00:19:33.133 --> 00:19:34.866
Question.
What are the odds

00:19:34.866 --> 00:19:37.333
that the second die will
also turn up six?

00:19:37.333 --> 00:19:38.733
Let's see...

00:19:38.733 --> 00:19:40.800
six plus six is 12...

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.600
It's 12!
(buzzer)

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:45.666
Wrong. The answer is
one in six.

00:19:45.666 --> 00:19:47.033
What a fiasco!

00:19:47.033 --> 00:19:49.100
It would take
a mathematical miracle

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:50.866
for him to win
this duel.

00:19:52.533 --> 00:19:53.566
Action trap!

00:19:53.566 --> 00:19:56.066
The category is Science
For 300.

00:19:56.066 --> 00:19:58.700
Observe. There are
300 kilograms of steel

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:00.533
and 300 kilograms
of cotton.

00:20:00.533 --> 00:20:02.133
Question.
Which is heavier?

00:20:02.133 --> 00:20:03.733
That's gotta be
a trick question,

00:20:03.733 --> 00:20:04.933
so the answer is cotton!

00:20:04.933 --> 00:20:06.100
(buzzer)
Wrong.

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:07.800
They both weigh
the same.

00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:11.000
He can't get
one right.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.266
If only his brain were
as fast as his mouth!

00:20:13.266 --> 00:20:15.966
Even a kindergartener
could do better!

00:20:15.966 --> 00:20:18.366
You keep getting
math and science questions,

00:20:18.366 --> 00:20:20.700
but that's how the croissant
crumbles, Yuya!

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:22.200
And whenever
you pick up a card,

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.766
it's a trivia
question!

00:20:23.766 --> 00:20:25.166
(thinking)
<i>It's as if he knew</i>

00:20:25.166 --> 00:20:26.566
where the trivia cards
would be

00:20:26.566 --> 00:20:28.100
and picked
those up first.

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:30.400
And he left all the cards he
knew I'd have trouble with

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:32.166
<i>for me to pick up!</i>

00:20:32.166 --> 00:20:34.133
Thanks, Pierre!

00:20:34.133 --> 00:20:35.800
I pity you,
Monsieur Yuya.

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:37.433
Your performance has
been so pathetic,

00:20:37.433 --> 00:20:39.900
you deserve to enter
the Dueling Hall of Shame!

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:41.766
I have enjoyed
watching you squirm,

00:20:41.766 --> 00:20:44.300
but I really want to see you
fly off the rails!

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:47.533
In this next round,
I'm upping the ante!

00:20:47.533 --> 00:20:48.900
What's that mean?

00:20:51.666 --> 00:20:54.866
You will see
when I activate this card!

00:20:54.866 --> 00:20:57.133
If you found the Quiz Quest
challenging,

00:20:57.133 --> 00:20:59.400
then your brain
should quiver with dread

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:02.366
as you enter the next phase
of our battle!

00:21:02.366 --> 00:21:05.133
Quiz Quest
Extra Stage!

00:21:06.833 --> 00:21:09.400
The questions will
only get tougher for you!

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:11.966
Prepare to be
flambéed!

00:21:11.966 --> 00:21:13.533
(cackling)
