Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! ARC‐V"...

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.566
(announcer)
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to third round

00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:09.600
of the Arc League
Championship!

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.033
Here are your 16
remaining duelists.

00:00:13.033 --> 00:00:14.933
I think that
he means 15.

00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:16.966
Yeah, Shay's nowhere
to be found.

00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:20.133
These competitors won't be
dueling here in the stadium.

00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:22.433
They'll be dueling
throughout the whole city.

00:00:22.433 --> 00:00:23.533
(both)
What?!

00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:25.033
Well‐done, Declan.

00:00:25.033 --> 00:00:27.866
By announcing duels will be
taking place around the city,

00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:29.633
the public won't know
the difference

00:00:29.633 --> 00:00:33.600
between tournament duels and
battles against Leo's forces.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.966
Right. Which means
there won't be a panic.

00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:38.400
Because while our
16 junior duelists

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.866
fight it out
in the city,

00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:41.700
the eight finalists
in the Senior Division

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.533
will fight off
our invaders.

00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:45.500
Shay, you have
a different mission.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.966
You are to continue
taking part in the tournament

00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:50.300
and determine if any of
the other finalists

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.433
have the skills, courage,
and determination

00:00:52.433 --> 00:00:54.100
to become
one of the Lancers.

<i>The hunt is on!</i>

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.633
If our challengers
want to duel,

00:02:03.633 --> 00:02:06.533
they must first find
two Pendulum Cards.

00:02:06.533 --> 00:02:09.966
Then they must decide how
many cards to put on the
line.

00:02:09.966 --> 00:02:12.400
Winners win the cards
and our top spot

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.600
will be determined by the
number of Pendulum Cards

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.166
each of our 16 players
has after 24 hours.

00:02:18.166 --> 00:02:20.966
These Pendulum Cards
could be just about anywhere.

00:02:20.966 --> 00:02:22.433
I know.

00:02:22.433 --> 00:02:25.233
Finding them might be harder
than actually dueling for them.

00:02:25.233 --> 00:02:26.966
This city's huge.

00:02:26.966 --> 00:02:30.433
Bet we'll find them
faster if we split up.

00:02:30.433 --> 00:02:31.666
Wait!

00:02:31.666 --> 00:02:33.000
What's wrong?

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.500
Just be careful, 'kay?

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.933
You be careful, too, Yuya.

00:02:39.933 --> 00:02:43.133
It's time to set the stage
for our star performers.

00:02:43.133 --> 00:02:45.266
<i>Go...</i>

00:02:45.266 --> 00:02:48.800
<i>Quartet of Quandary!</i>

00:03:01.266 --> 00:03:05.366
Now, let's check out
our four battle zones.

00:03:05.366 --> 00:03:07.833
<i>Volcano! It's a blast!</i>

00:03:07.833 --> 00:03:10.166
Iceberg!
Chilling and thrilling!

00:03:10.166 --> 00:03:12.633
Jungle!
Dense and dangerous!

00:03:12.633 --> 00:03:15.600
Ancient Ruins!
Archaically chaotic!

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.333
The fans are ready.
The fields are set.

00:03:18.333 --> 00:03:21.600
The challengers have until
noon tomorrow to grab the
glory.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.600
And now,
it's time to go!

00:03:30.933 --> 00:03:32.333
Finally.

00:03:32.333 --> 00:03:35.500
(Taka)
Looks like Yuya found
his two Pendulum Cards.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.533
(chuckling)

00:03:37.533 --> 00:03:40.333
That means one card for me
and one for you.

00:03:40.333 --> 00:03:43.166
Easy pickings for
the Banded Warrior Academy.

00:03:43.166 --> 00:03:45.366
Banded Warrior.

00:03:45.366 --> 00:03:47.566
That means they'll duel
just like Iggy.

00:03:47.566 --> 00:03:49.733
And he was more about
duking thank dueling.

00:03:51.033 --> 00:03:53.200
And I have to take on
two at once.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.233
(announcer) It looks
like our first duel

00:03:55.233 --> 00:03:57.900
in the Volcano zone
is about to erupt.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.200
It's Taka and Nagi from
the Banded Warrior Academy

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.000
versus You Show Duel
School's Yuya Sakaki...

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.966
This doesn't
look good.

00:04:06.966 --> 00:04:10.500
Those Banded Warrior Academy
guys are super tough.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.366
(announcer)
<i>...Let the battle begin!</i>

00:04:13.366 --> 00:04:15.266
All right,
you know the rules.

00:04:15.266 --> 00:04:17.266
We each ante up
Pendulum Cards.

00:04:17.266 --> 00:04:18.966
One card each.

00:04:18.966 --> 00:04:20.400
Fine.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.466
(all)
Duel!

00:04:22.466 --> 00:04:24.100
(announcer) The
Pendulum Cards are out

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.766
and the battle lines
are drawn.

00:04:25.766 --> 00:04:26.966
<i>Facing Yuya are...</i>

00:04:26.966 --> 00:04:30.000
Mr. President.
What's the situation here?

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.933
The duel between
Yuya Sakaki

00:04:31.933 --> 00:04:34.233
and Banded Warrior Academy
is just starting.

00:04:34.233 --> 00:04:37.000
(announcer)
...We've got the
performing artists

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.733
versus the
martial artists.

00:04:38.733 --> 00:04:41.066
<i>And it's winner‐take‐all.</i>

00:04:43.366 --> 00:04:44.633
Huh?

00:04:44.633 --> 00:04:46.633
(both chuckling)

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.266
(gasps)

00:04:52.266 --> 00:04:54.666
(Yuya thinking)
I don't care if there's
two or 10 of them.

00:04:54.666 --> 00:04:58.033
I'm still gonna duel my way.

00:04:58.033 --> 00:05:00.066
I start the show off
by summoning

00:05:00.066 --> 00:05:02.233
Performapal
Skeeter Skimmer!

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.300
Bring it on.
Yeah, let's go, superstar.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.100
You may have got
Iggy off‐guard...

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.066
But we've seen
how cruel you duel.

00:05:12.066 --> 00:05:14.133
We know you don't
show mercy to anyone.

00:05:14.133 --> 00:05:16.533
So we won't
show any either.

00:05:16.533 --> 00:05:18.166
No!

00:05:18.166 --> 00:05:20.200
When I battled Iggy,

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.366
something took over.

00:05:22.366 --> 00:05:24.366
That‐‐ that wasn't me.

00:05:25.566 --> 00:05:27.833
I'll never duel
like that again.

00:05:27.833 --> 00:05:29.500
No matter what!

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.800
I play a facedown.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.833
Your turn.

00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:35.300
Hey, hey!

00:05:39.133 --> 00:05:41.400
Gong's got his second
Pendulum Card,

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.166
so Gong's now part
of the party!

00:05:43.166 --> 00:05:45.100
(woman giggling)
Who's there?

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.100
(giggling continues)

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.166
Huh? Wait.

00:05:54.933 --> 00:05:58.633
Our turn.

00:05:58.633 --> 00:06:02.000
You're not the only one who's
got Pendulum skills anymore.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.800
I set the Pendulum Scale

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.300
with Scale Five Pendulum Statue
Purple Shield

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.700
and Scale 11 Purple Sword!

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.966
Now I can summon monsters

00:06:10.966 --> 00:06:14.933
between level six and 10
at the same time.

00:06:14.933 --> 00:06:16.900
I Pendulum Summon

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.900
Tsumuji the Earthwind Star...

00:06:23.833 --> 00:06:28.733
and Arashi the Skywind Star!

00:06:28.733 --> 00:06:32.433
(announcer)Whoa, Taka is taking
it to Yuya right out of the
gate!

00:06:32.433 --> 00:06:36.000
He just Pendulum Summoned
two mega monsters!

00:06:38.433 --> 00:06:41.966
Purple Sword's Pendulum
ability now activates.

00:06:41.966 --> 00:06:46.000
So my two warriors gain
200 attack points each.

00:06:49.633 --> 00:06:51.500
(both roaring)

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.066
Battle time.

00:06:55.066 --> 00:06:58.066
Tsumuji, take aim and sink
that Skeeter Skimmer.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:02.600
I activate Skeeter's
special ability.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.900
It switches to defense mode
and stops your attack.

00:07:07.266 --> 00:07:10.533
Well, I've got more monster
where that came from.

00:07:10.533 --> 00:07:13.000
Arashi, take aim.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.400
(thinking)
I better do something.

00:07:18.433 --> 00:07:20.600
I'll grab that
Action Card and‐‐

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.600
(yelling)

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.066
That was rude!

00:07:36.066 --> 00:07:37.600
Don't you have
any manners?!

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:41.266
They really know
how to double‐team Yuya.

00:07:42.433 --> 00:07:45.600
I activate
the Action Spell Flame Ball.

00:07:47.533 --> 00:07:48.933
And just like that,

00:07:48.933 --> 00:07:52.100
200 of your life points
go up in flames.

00:07:53.366 --> 00:07:55.866
Nice one, Nagi.
Thank you, Taka.

00:07:55.866 --> 00:07:57.900
(thinking)
These guys play rough.

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:00.233
But not rough enough
to beat me!

00:08:00.233 --> 00:08:03.133
Ready for more, Yuya?
Yeah!

00:08:03.133 --> 00:08:04.666
That's excellent to hear

00:08:04.666 --> 00:08:07.600
because I'm activating
the spell Polymerization.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.333
<i>This is unbelievable.</i>

00:08:09.333 --> 00:08:12.500
Taka's about to mix things up
to bring Yuya down.

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:15.933
I fuse Tsumuji and Arashi!

00:08:15.933 --> 00:08:18.366
Together...

00:08:18.366 --> 00:08:20.466
these two titans combine

00:08:20.466 --> 00:08:23.400
into one furious warrior!

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:28.333
I Fusion Summon
Fujin the Breakstorm Star!

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:34.033
And Fujin's got
an interesting special ability.

00:08:34.033 --> 00:08:35.800
At the end of a turn,

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:38.133
for every warrior‐type
monster on the field,

00:08:38.133 --> 00:08:41.300
you'll take
500 points of damage.

00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:42.566
(grunts)

00:08:42.566 --> 00:08:45.000
Now, I think I'll
turn it over to my partner,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.266
but not before Fujin's ability
does some damage.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.533
(thinking)
I have to do something fast.

00:08:54.533 --> 00:08:57.233
I've gotta find
an Action Card.

00:08:57.233 --> 00:08:59.133
Look,
he's running scared.

00:08:59.133 --> 00:09:00.700
Yeah,
but he won't get far.

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:02.666
You hear me?

00:09:02.666 --> 00:09:04.666
Loud and clear.

00:09:09.333 --> 00:09:12.566
(groaning)
I wish this shirt had sleeves.

00:09:12.566 --> 00:09:14.566
(boy groans)
Huh?

00:09:14.566 --> 00:09:17.433
Running around searching
for Pendulum Cards,

00:09:17.433 --> 00:09:20.600
I am perspiring just as much
as I did back home.

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.233
(gasps)
Ah!

00:09:23.233 --> 00:09:26.666
You are the Fusion
Summoner Zuzu Boyle.
Huh?

00:09:26.666 --> 00:09:28.300
I am Halil,
an exchange student

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:31.000
attending the prestigious
Leo Institute of Dueling.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.066
I am a Fusion
Summoner as well.

00:09:34.066 --> 00:09:36.900
It's an honor.
Uh, I'm honored, too.

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:40.400
I have followed your journey
in the tournament very closely.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.566
It is my dream
to duel you.

00:09:42.566 --> 00:09:44.400
I'd be happy
to duel you, too,

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.666
but I haven't found
my second Pendulum Card yet.

00:09:46.666 --> 00:09:48.333
In that case,
it is fortunate

00:09:48.333 --> 00:09:50.333
that I was able
to locate three cards.

00:09:50.333 --> 00:09:53.266
It would be my great pleasure
if you would accept one of mine

00:09:53.266 --> 00:09:55.566
so that we will be able
to duel one another.

00:09:55.566 --> 00:09:58.566
That's so nice.
Thanks very much, Halil.

00:09:58.566 --> 00:10:01.466
I must warn you
that you will not win.

00:10:01.466 --> 00:10:03.133
We'll just see
about that.

00:10:03.133 --> 00:10:05.900
When I battle, I'm all about
taking center stage.

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:09.466
And I don't plan on giving up
the spotlight to anyone.

00:10:09.466 --> 00:10:11.200
(chuckles)

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.233
Let us get the show
on the road.

00:10:13.233 --> 00:10:15.333
Yeah, let's.

00:10:15.333 --> 00:10:19.633
(announcer)Well, it looks like
things are heating up in the
Iceberg zone.

00:10:19.633 --> 00:10:23.666
(both)
The Pendulum Card
I wager is this one.

00:10:23.666 --> 00:10:26.833
The battle between You Show
Duel School's Zuzu Boyle

00:10:26.833 --> 00:10:29.033
and Leo's Institute's
exchange student Halil

00:10:29.033 --> 00:10:31.166
could be the coolest
duel ever.

00:10:31.166 --> 00:10:33.366
(both)
Let's duel!

00:10:33.366 --> 00:10:35.433
Come on, Zuzu,
get fired up!

00:10:35.433 --> 00:10:36.933
Toast this guy!

00:10:36.933 --> 00:10:39.466
Being able to watch
two duels at once

00:10:39.466 --> 00:10:41.966
is giving me
the double goose pickles.

00:10:41.966 --> 00:10:45.266
For now, but it might not
be two duels for long.

00:10:48.566 --> 00:10:49.933
(Tate)
These guys have Yuya on the run!

00:10:49.933 --> 00:10:52.066
Bad news, Yuya.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.066
It's Pendulum time.

00:10:56.066 --> 00:10:57.866
I set the Pendulum Scale

00:10:57.866 --> 00:11:01.533
with Scale Five Purple Shield
and Scale 11 Purple Sword.

00:11:01.533 --> 00:11:04.500
I may have the same
two Pendulum Cards are Taka,

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:08.466
but I'm bringing out different
monsters to suit my style.

00:11:08.466 --> 00:11:10.433
I Pendulum Summon

00:11:10.433 --> 00:11:13.333
Todoroki
the Earthbolt Star...

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:18.166
and Senko the Skybolt Star!

00:11:20.233 --> 00:11:23.100
(announcer)
Another successful
Pendulum Summon

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:24.766
from the dynamic
duelists,

00:11:24.766 --> 00:11:27.333
as the action is
just getting underway

00:11:27.333 --> 00:11:29.266
<i>in the Iceberg zone.</i>

00:11:29.266 --> 00:11:31.000
Let us begin.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.466
La Jinn the Mystical Genie
of the Lamp,

00:11:33.466 --> 00:11:35.633
appear to grant my wishes!

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.800
At this time,
I place two cards facedown

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.966
and end my turn.

00:11:43.966 --> 00:11:45.466
My turn now.

00:11:45.466 --> 00:11:47.033
I draw!

00:11:47.033 --> 00:11:48.433
(thinking)
All right!

00:11:49.733 --> 00:11:51.866
I set the Pendulum Scale

00:11:51.866 --> 00:11:54.500
with Scale Three
Pendulum Statue White Butterfly

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:57.400
and Scale Nine
Pendulum Statue White Flower.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.166
You Pendulum Summon?

00:12:01.166 --> 00:12:04.400
My Pendulum Summon debut
is today!

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:09.433
In that case, I shall activate
the trap Absorbing Lamp!

00:12:09.433 --> 00:12:12.266
My lamp stops you from
building the Pendulum Scale

00:12:12.266 --> 00:12:14.566
by allowing me to take
one of your Pendulum Cards

00:12:14.566 --> 00:12:15.933
into my possession.

00:12:15.933 --> 00:12:18.833
(gasps)
Pendulum Statue
White Flower, please.

00:12:23.133 --> 00:12:26.800
My first Pendulum Summon's
not panning out.

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.466
Thank you so much
for the Pendulum Card.

00:12:30.466 --> 00:12:33.166
I know it will be quite useful
in my quest to defeat you.

00:12:33.166 --> 00:12:35.566
I hope you're not upset
with my actions.

00:12:35.566 --> 00:12:39.466
I'm not, Halil, but I can't say
you won't be after this.

00:12:39.466 --> 00:12:43.366
I summon Opera
the Melodious Diva.

00:12:43.366 --> 00:12:45.833
I hope you're ready for
an amazing performance

00:12:45.833 --> 00:12:48.933
because this diva's about to
belt out a number of vocal hits.

00:12:53.666 --> 00:12:57.300
Coming to duel in this place
feels like coming home.

00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:00.633
I cannot lose with
the home‐court advantage.

00:13:00.633 --> 00:13:02.466
Advantage, smantage.

00:13:02.466 --> 00:13:04.833
Every winter, Gong goes
and trains on a glacier.

00:13:04.833 --> 00:13:06.866
I am Olga.

00:13:06.866 --> 00:13:09.466
And I am from Leo Institute's
Arctic Campus.

00:13:09.466 --> 00:13:11.600
It will be my pleasure
to beat you.

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:14.000
(announcer)
And now we've got
another pair of duelists

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.733
about to mix it up
in the Iceberg zone.

00:13:16.733 --> 00:13:18.300
But right now,
let's check out

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:21.766
the thrilling, chilling duel
already underway.

00:13:21.766 --> 00:13:24.466
It is my turn.
I draw now.

00:13:24.466 --> 00:13:27.100
(gasps)
A Pendulum Card!

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:29.433
Don't tell me
what you have, Halil.

00:13:29.433 --> 00:13:32.566
Sorry, but I cannot hide
my intense delight.

00:13:32.566 --> 00:13:35.000
I have dreamed of the time

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.800
I would use a Pendulum Card.

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:38.466
Now it is here.

00:13:40.433 --> 00:13:44.466
With Scale One Red Fiend
and Scale Nine White Flower,

00:13:44.466 --> 00:13:47.833
I set the Pendulum Scale!

00:13:47.833 --> 00:13:49.500
(buzzer sounds)
What the...

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:52.700
Hey! Come on!
(buzzer sounding)

00:13:54.466 --> 00:13:56.900
Something is very wrong.

00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:59.266
Perhaps this is
some kind of trick card

00:13:59.266 --> 00:14:02.500
or perhaps my Duel Disk
is not processing properly.

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:04.133
Maybe if I...
(buzzer sounding)

00:14:04.133 --> 00:14:06.666
Nope. Fail.
(sighs)

00:14:06.666 --> 00:14:09.333
Spread them out.

00:14:11.166 --> 00:14:12.800
What?

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:15.000
You put one Pendulum Card
on the very far left

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.433
and the other Pendulum Card
on the very far right!

00:14:17.433 --> 00:14:18.800
Okay, I will
give that a try.

00:14:22.566 --> 00:14:24.333
(beeping)

00:14:24.333 --> 00:14:26.733
It worked!
Thank you so much!

00:14:26.733 --> 00:14:30.000
I guess I've paid you back
for giving me a Pendulum Card.

00:14:31.566 --> 00:14:33.733
At last, I am able
to summon monsters

00:14:33.733 --> 00:14:36.766
between level two
and level eight simultaneously.

00:14:36.766 --> 00:14:38.733
I Pendulum Summon

00:14:38.733 --> 00:14:40.733
Appear Red Lamp...

00:14:41.966 --> 00:14:44.366
and Purple Lamp!

00:14:44.366 --> 00:14:46.700
Hurray, I have
successfully achieved

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:48.700
my first‐ever
Pendulum Summon!

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:51.466
And I will explore
its many intricacies.

00:14:51.466 --> 00:14:53.500
I will begin
my exploration

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:55.866
by activating Red Lamp's
special ability.

00:14:55.866 --> 00:14:58.233
When this card
is successfully summoned,

00:14:58.233 --> 00:15:01.533
you receive 600 points
of devastating damage!

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:08.300
Yes!
I can really do this!

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:10.366
You should be
proud of yourself.

00:15:10.366 --> 00:15:13.866
Now, I shall activate
Purple Lamp's special ability!

00:15:13.866 --> 00:15:15.966
I am able to add
the spell card

00:15:15.966 --> 00:15:18.366
Polymerization to my hand!

00:15:18.366 --> 00:15:20.366
Get ready, Zuzu,
because now,

00:15:20.366 --> 00:15:22.833
I activate Polymerization!

00:15:22.833 --> 00:15:24.500
No way!

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:26.700
La Jinn the Mystical Genie
of the Lamp

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:29.900
and my Red Lamp
will now fuse!

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:31.933
The wish granting
spirit of the lamp,

00:15:31.933 --> 00:15:34.300
summoned from the vast void
of the unknown,

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:36.966
will be inflamed
with the force of fire!

00:15:36.966 --> 00:15:38.700
I Fusion Summon

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:42.200
Fire Djinn the Flame Genie
of the Lamp!

00:15:47.333 --> 00:15:48.433
(announcer)
<i>Oh, my!</i>

00:15:48.433 --> 00:15:50.600
<i>Halil's game is on fire!</i>

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:53.600
He just might be
a wish away from winning!

00:15:57.366 --> 00:15:59.166
(announcer)
Halil looks like
he has the upper hand,

00:15:59.166 --> 00:16:01.600
but Zuzu's not about to
go down without a fight.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:04.433
I activate my genie's
special ability.

00:16:04.433 --> 00:16:06.333
When he's
successfully summoned,

00:16:06.333 --> 00:16:09.000
you take 600 points
of damage.

00:16:10.133 --> 00:16:12.133
(groaning)

00:16:13.533 --> 00:16:16.733
And now, due to Red Fiend's
Pendulum ability,

00:16:16.733 --> 00:16:19.966
my genie gains
300 attack points.

00:16:24.666 --> 00:16:26.366
Let us battle.

00:16:26.366 --> 00:16:31.033
Fire Djinn, attack
Opera the Melodious Diva!

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.233
Now, Zuzu, Purple Lamp
attacks you directly.

00:16:47.933 --> 00:16:49.833
(screaming)

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.533
Huh? An Action Card.

00:16:56.766 --> 00:16:58.766
(screaming continues)

00:16:59.966 --> 00:17:03.000
Do not fear,
we are on our way!

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.200
Zuzu!

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:09.900
(thinking)
There's gotta be
an Action Card someplace.

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:13.300
I activate my Purple Sword's
Pendulum ability.

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:17.100
Now my monsters gain
200 attack points.

00:17:20.633 --> 00:17:22.633
Todoroki,
trip him up

00:17:22.633 --> 00:17:24.833
so that he'll never
reach an Action Card!

00:17:28.533 --> 00:17:29.766
Ah!

00:17:33.833 --> 00:17:36.200
(screaming)

00:17:37.966 --> 00:17:39.966
(grunting)
Huh?

00:17:41.933 --> 00:17:43.933
Heh.

00:17:43.933 --> 00:17:45.566
You came close, Yuya.

00:17:45.566 --> 00:17:47.966
Too bad close doesn't count.

00:17:47.966 --> 00:17:49.033
(chuckling)

00:17:51.566 --> 00:17:54.333
I active the Action Spell
Flame Ball!

00:17:54.333 --> 00:17:57.866
Say bye‐bye
to 200 life points.

00:17:57.866 --> 00:17:59.533
Whoa!

00:18:01.533 --> 00:18:03.933
Look out, Yuya,
'cause here comes Senko.

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:10.366
I'll shut him down with my trap
Performapal Pinch Helper!

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:15.400
Your monster's
direct attack is denied!

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:17.633
And now I can summon
a Performapal in my deck

00:18:17.633 --> 00:18:19.400
with 800 attack points or less

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:21.266
by giving up
its special ability.

00:18:21.266 --> 00:18:24.533
I summon Thunderhino!

00:18:24.533 --> 00:18:26.533
(roaring)

00:18:27.566 --> 00:18:29.166
You're wasting your time.

00:18:29.166 --> 00:18:31.166
I play Frontline Fusion!

00:18:32.266 --> 00:18:35.333
I fuse Senko and Todoroki!

00:18:35.333 --> 00:18:37.533
I might lose
with this fuse.

00:18:38.833 --> 00:18:41.366
Ignite the heavens,
shake the earth.

00:18:41.366 --> 00:18:43.366
Powers of
lightning and thunder,

00:18:43.366 --> 00:18:44.966
unleash your fury!

00:18:44.966 --> 00:18:46.766
I Fusion Summon

00:18:46.766 --> 00:18:49.700
Raijin the Breakbolt Star!

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:52.700
Due to Raijin's
special ability,

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:54.700
when it attacks a monster
in defense mode,

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:56.166
you still take damage.

00:18:56.166 --> 00:18:57.566
It appears that the two of us

00:18:57.566 --> 00:19:00.266
were just too much for you
to overcome, Yuya.

00:19:00.266 --> 00:19:02.266
Yuya's gotta think of
something fast!

00:19:02.266 --> 00:19:04.833
He has only 800
life points left!

00:19:04.833 --> 00:19:06.600
One attack
and showtime's over.

00:19:08.633 --> 00:19:13.133
(Nagi)
Raijin, destroy that Rhino
to win this duel!

00:19:13.133 --> 00:19:15.866
You're not going to end
my show that easily!

00:19:15.866 --> 00:19:18.000
By sending Pinch Helper
to the graveyard,

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.700
I toughen my Rhino's hide

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:22.233
so that the damage I take
is cut in half!

00:19:31.433 --> 00:19:33.366
(yelling)

00:19:43.833 --> 00:19:45.700
Unless you want
to get flambeed,

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:47.000
you best get out
of Gong's way.

00:19:48.366 --> 00:19:50.033
I move for no one.

00:19:50.033 --> 00:19:52.833
(gasps)
(screaming)

00:19:52.833 --> 00:19:55.400
Where I am?
Zuzu?

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:58.366
Gong, it's you.
(Olga) Excuse me.

00:19:58.366 --> 00:20:00.833
You move before I remove.
Oh, sorry.

00:20:02.933 --> 00:20:06.033
(beeping)
(computer)
Battle Royal mode engaged.

00:20:06.033 --> 00:20:08.400
<i>Joining Tag Duel.</i>

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:11.000
What?
Gong thinks this is crazy.

00:20:13.033 --> 00:20:15.033
Pardon me.

00:20:15.033 --> 00:20:17.533
Ah, what is the meaning
of this message?

00:20:17.533 --> 00:20:20.366
Hmm, well, look what
we have here, fans.

00:20:20.366 --> 00:20:24.633
They've accidentally trigged
a tag‐team duel.

00:20:24.633 --> 00:20:27.133
Zuzu and Gong
are dueling as a team now.

00:20:27.133 --> 00:20:29.666
My pickles is goosed!

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:34.900
We've been looking
for you Shay Obsidian.

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:38.333
We don't like what you did
to our friend Sir Shalack.

00:20:38.333 --> 00:20:41.200
Now it's time
to make you pay.

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:44.133
I see. You're looking
for a little payback.

00:20:44.133 --> 00:20:46.600
Well, let's see you
try and collect.

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:09.433
It looks to me like Yuya's
down for the count, Nagi.

00:21:09.433 --> 00:21:12.266
I think it's safe to say
showtime's over, Taka.

00:21:12.266 --> 00:21:14.400
Say whatever you want!

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:16.933
The show's gonna go on!

00:21:16.933 --> 00:21:18.166
Go ahead, run.

00:21:18.166 --> 00:21:20.766
But don't forget about
Fujin's special ability.

00:21:20.766 --> 00:21:21.933
When this turn ends,

00:21:21.933 --> 00:21:24.600
you lose 1,000 life points
and the duel.

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:26.900
And this turn ends now.

00:21:41.833 --> 00:21:44.666
Two on one doesn't seem
like a fair game.

00:21:44.666 --> 00:21:46.866
(all) Huh?

00:21:46.866 --> 00:21:48.733
Mind if I join in?

00:21:48.733 --> 00:21:51.700
'Cause I love the limelight.

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:53.700
(laughing)

00:23:05.933 --> 00:23:09.000
