[IRIS] Many years ago,
mankind faced a divine fury

00:00:29.154 --> 00:00:32.073 position:50% align:center
In an event known as the
"Day of the Cataclysm,"

00:00:32.157 --> 00:00:35.076 position:50% align:center
our entire world was burned.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.412 position:50% align:center
The fire raged with an
intensity that threatened

00:00:37.495 --> 00:00:39.748 position:50% align:center
to reduce mankind to ash.

00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:42.792 position:50% align:center
The places they lived,
the languages they spoke,

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:44.794 position:50% align:center
the culture they had built.

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:47.088 position:50% align:center
None could escape its wrath.

00:01:04.647 --> 00:01:06.733 position:50% align:center
[YONA, ARROW]
<i>LÃ¡tom.</i>

00:01:06.816 --> 00:01:08.526 position:50% align:center
[ARROW]
Haran has returned to the flame.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.570 position:50% align:center
He died a martyr.

00:01:14.157 --> 00:01:17.577 position:50% align:center
It was a small price to pay
for the birth of a new demon.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.371 position:50% align:center
No regrets.

00:01:22.957 --> 00:01:26.211 position:50% align:center
Also, the boy from Company
8 with an Adolla Burst

00:01:26.294 --> 00:01:29.464 position:50% align:center
experienced an Adolla
Link with the demon.

00:01:29.547 --> 00:01:33.301 position:50% align:center
Then that settles it.
Yes, we must acquire him.

00:01:33.385 --> 00:01:35.220 position:50% align:center
For the Evangelist wills it.

00:01:35.303 --> 00:01:39.265 position:50% align:center
It's a waste for the Fire Force
to have an asset like that.

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:42.227 position:50% align:center
There may be more to
this than it seems.

00:01:43.895 --> 00:01:46.064 position:50% align:center
I'll go along next time.

00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:51.486 position:50% align:center
A new team member
coming out of nowhere?

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:53.863 position:50% align:center
It seems kind of sudden,
don't you think?

00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:56.241 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA] Haijima strong-armed
one of their people through

00:01:56.324 --> 00:01:59.619 position:50% align:center
since the Eighth doesn't
have its own science team.

00:01:59.703 --> 00:02:01.746 position:50% align:center
They're plotting something.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.748 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
That's a little harsh.

00:02:03.832 --> 00:02:05.750 position:50% align:center
After the whole
Evangelist incident,

00:02:05.834 --> 00:02:07.669 position:50% align:center
every company is
under Imperial order

00:02:07.752 --> 00:02:10.755 position:50% align:center
to step up their scientific
investigations, right?

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:12.799 position:50% align:center
I know we've been lagging
a bit in that area,

00:02:12.882 --> 00:02:14.843 position:50% align:center
but we were searching
out new members.

00:02:14.926 --> 00:02:17.595 position:50% align:center
In the meantime, Captain Hibana
has been providing us

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:18.972 position:50% align:center
with all the support we need.

00:02:19.055 --> 00:02:21.891 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Yeah, but that's
a bad habit to get into

00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:25.270 position:50% align:center
and I'm sure a captain like her
has plenty on her plate already.

00:02:25.353 --> 00:02:28.732 position:50% align:center
Haijima saw a problem and
offered me as a solution.

00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:29.941 position:50% align:center
[LICHT chuckles]

00:02:30.025 --> 00:02:31.985 position:50% align:center
Therefore, I will now be serving

00:02:32.068 --> 00:02:35.530 position:50% align:center
as Special Fire Force
Company 8's head scientist.

00:02:35.613 --> 00:02:37.824 position:50% align:center
The name's Viktor Licht.

00:03:06.728 --> 00:03:08.688 position:50% align:center
<i>take what you got and leave now</i>

00:03:08.772 --> 00:03:10.857 position:50% align:center

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.611 position:50% align:center

00:03:14.694 --> 00:03:16.654 position:50% align:center

<i>he wants you, don't you?</i>

00:03:22.577 --> 00:03:26.539 position:50% align:center

00:03:57.987 --> 00:04:01.950 position:50% align:center
<i>MAYDAY</i>

00:04:02.033 --> 00:04:05.954 position:50% align:center
<i>MAYDAY</i>

00:04:06.037 --> 00:04:09.666 position:50% align:center
<i>MAYDAY</i>

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:16.214 position:50% align:center
Smells like a rat
if you ask me.

00:04:16.297 --> 00:04:18.383 position:50% align:center
A proper Fire Force salute
should be performed

00:04:18.466 --> 00:04:20.427 position:50% align:center
with the right hand,
not the left one.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.554 position:50% align:center
Oh, uh. Not really my thing.

00:04:22.637 --> 00:04:23.763 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:04:23.847 --> 00:04:27.100 position:50% align:center
Those scientists, right?
Head in the clouds!

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:31.646 position:50% align:center
So... indulge my curiosity!

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.982 position:50% align:center
I simply have to see
your Adolla Burst!

00:04:34.065 --> 00:04:35.984 position:50% align:center
Ooh, show me! Ah, show me!

00:04:36.067 --> 00:04:37.736 position:50% align:center
[LICHT laughing]

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:40.071 position:50% align:center
Don't get touchy feely with him!

00:04:40.155 --> 00:04:42.115 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Yes, ma'am.

00:04:42.198 --> 00:04:45.243 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
My foot!

00:04:46.494 --> 00:04:49.289 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Viktor Licht. Let's see.

00:04:49.372 --> 00:04:52.417 position:50% align:center
Advanced placement into
Tokyo Imperial University.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.461 position:50% align:center
Graduated at the top
of your class.

00:04:54.544 --> 00:04:56.671 position:50% align:center
Headed the applied
pyrokinesiology lab

00:04:56.755 --> 00:04:58.506 position:50% align:center
at Haijima Heavy Industries.

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.176 position:50% align:center
I must admit,
it's quite the resume.

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:02.761 position:50% align:center
Hmm...

00:05:02.844 --> 00:05:05.722 position:50% align:center
What can I say? I'm brilliant.

00:05:05.805 --> 00:05:07.724 position:50% align:center
More like suspiciously
brilliant.

00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:11.102 position:50% align:center
This place is a dump.
Why would you wanna work here?

00:05:11.186 --> 00:05:13.438 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Haijima kept me cooped
up in my lab all the time

00:05:13.521 --> 00:05:14.856 position:50% align:center
and it was starting
to get stale.

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:16.941 position:50% align:center
I thought if I joined an outfit
closer to the action,

00:05:17.025 --> 00:05:18.485 position:50% align:center
I might be able to get
some intriguing new data

00:05:18.568 --> 00:05:20.403 position:50% align:center
out on the front lines,
so to speak.

00:05:20.487 --> 00:05:22.906 position:50% align:center
If I cause any trouble,
you can kick me out,

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:24.699 position:50% align:center
but at least let
me join for now.

00:05:24.783 --> 00:05:26.368 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Uhh...

00:05:26.451 --> 00:05:28.745 position:50% align:center
Looking at your staff list,
I'm a little worried.

00:05:28.828 --> 00:05:31.539 position:50% align:center
You guys don't have an
engineer yet, do you?

00:05:31.623 --> 00:05:33.625 position:50% align:center
It's nice that you have
a researcher now,

00:05:33.708 --> 00:05:36.920 position:50% align:center
but are any of you qualified
to service your vehicle?

00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:39.005 position:50% align:center
You gotta take care
of that stuff.

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:40.715 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Yeah, that's on the agenda.

00:05:40.799 --> 00:05:42.467 position:50% align:center
We have someone in mind already.

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.511 position:50% align:center
Lieutenant, have you
been able to reach him?

00:05:44.594 --> 00:05:46.805 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA]
Vulcan? He hasn't replied.

00:05:46.888 --> 00:05:48.390 position:50% align:center
You're trying to recruit Vulcan?

00:05:48.473 --> 00:05:50.517 position:50% align:center
Are you taking this
seriously at all?

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.435 position:50% align:center
Should I know him?

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:55.021 position:50% align:center
The point is that nobody
can recruit him.

00:05:55.105 --> 00:05:56.898 position:50% align:center
Haijima, the Special Fire Force,

00:05:56.981 --> 00:06:00.068 position:50% align:center
he turns them all
away in an instant.

00:06:00.151 --> 00:06:03.196 position:50% align:center
But I'll tell you,
Vulcan's the real deal.

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:07.242 position:50% align:center
He's a true "God of the Forge,"
just like his namesake.

00:06:10.495 --> 00:06:12.789 position:50% align:center
We may have to make a personal
trip to his workshop

00:06:12.872 --> 00:06:14.749 position:50% align:center
if we wanna get
through to him.

00:06:14.833 --> 00:06:17.127 position:50% align:center
I don't think that's
gonna work out for you.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.170 position:50% align:center
He hates Haijima with a passion,

00:06:19.254 --> 00:06:21.923 position:50% align:center
and he hates the Fire Force
as much for working with them.

00:06:22.007 --> 00:06:24.175 position:50% align:center
He'll send you packing
like everyone else.

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:25.510 position:50% align:center
Okay, then.

00:06:25.593 --> 00:06:28.388 position:50% align:center
Shinra, I want you to head
to Vulcan's workshop.

00:06:28.471 --> 00:06:30.432 position:50% align:center
Take Iris and Arthur with you.

00:06:30.515 --> 00:06:32.267 position:50% align:center
Before we move
forward with anything,

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.186 position:50% align:center
I need to know if this guy's
Company 8 material.

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.313 position:50% align:center
You think we're good
to make that call?

00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:39.149 position:50% align:center
Why d'you wanna send us three?

00:06:39.232 --> 00:06:41.818 position:50% align:center
Vulcan is about your age,
so you might get along.

00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:43.403 position:50% align:center
Keep it casual, keep it honest,

00:06:43.486 --> 00:06:45.905 position:50% align:center
and don't let him think
you're trying too hard.

00:06:45.989 --> 00:06:47.282 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA, IRIS]
Yes, sir!

00:06:49.826 --> 00:06:51.369 position:50% align:center
[OBI] I don't want this
to be too formal,

00:06:51.453 --> 00:06:53.413 position:50% align:center
so it's better if you
go in your civvies.

00:06:53.496 --> 00:06:55.040 position:50% align:center
That doesn't mean you
need to be cagey

00:06:55.123 --> 00:06:56.374 position:50% align:center
about who you are, though.

00:06:56.458 --> 00:06:59.127 position:50% align:center
If we come across as deceptive,
he won't trust us.

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:00.920 position:50% align:center
Just try to say hello.

00:07:01.004 --> 00:07:03.757 position:50% align:center
If all the stories are true,
that may be hard enough.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.467 position:50% align:center
We'll show 'em some guts!

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:06.843 position:50% align:center
[IRIS]
Hm?

00:07:06.926 --> 00:07:08.762 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] The other companies
tried to tempt Vulcan

00:07:08.845 --> 00:07:11.348 position:50% align:center
with promises of
money or status.

00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:14.309 position:50% align:center
The 8th is just sending kids?

00:07:14.392 --> 00:07:17.103 position:50% align:center
I told you, Vulcan
loathes the Fire Force.

00:07:17.187 --> 00:07:19.314 position:50% align:center
This is a total waste
of your time.

00:07:19.397 --> 00:07:20.982 position:50% align:center
We're trying to change
the world here.

00:07:21.066 --> 00:07:25.528 position:50% align:center
We gotta do the impossible.
Let's try and see what happens.

00:07:25.612 --> 00:07:26.738 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
I just got here

00:07:26.821 --> 00:07:31.117 position:50% align:center
and things are getting
interesting already.

00:07:31.201 --> 00:07:33.286 position:50% align:center
Well, this should be
as good a test as any.

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:36.122 position:50% align:center
Let's see if you can help
us reach our goals or not,

00:07:36.206 --> 00:07:37.749 position:50% align:center
Company 8.

00:07:43.213 --> 00:07:45.590 position:50% align:center
I've seen that animal
in a picture book.

00:07:45.674 --> 00:07:47.550 position:50% align:center
The big one with the long snout.

00:07:47.634 --> 00:07:50.345 position:50% align:center
Yeah. It's called
an elephant, right?

00:07:50.428 --> 00:07:52.305 position:50% align:center
That's it. I think?

00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:55.558 position:50% align:center
This place is really something.

00:07:55.642 --> 00:07:57.602 position:50% align:center
Excuse me!

00:08:00.355 --> 00:08:02.273 position:50% align:center
Maybe he's not at home.

00:08:02.357 --> 00:08:04.359 position:50% align:center
Or he's just ignoring us.

00:08:04.442 --> 00:08:07.529 position:50% align:center
I am the Knight King,
Arthur Boyle.

00:08:07.612 --> 00:08:08.738 position:50% align:center
Fire Soldier!

00:08:08.822 --> 00:08:10.865 position:50% align:center
[IRIS screams]

00:08:10.949 --> 00:08:13.660 position:50% align:center
How audacious of you to
disrespect the Knight King!

00:08:13.743 --> 00:08:15.912 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] It's the Fire Soldier
part he didn't like!

00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:17.497 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
Get lost!

00:08:19.624 --> 00:08:21.376 position:50% align:center
Owie!

00:08:21.459 --> 00:08:23.795 position:50% align:center
Hah. Slow-witted dolt.

00:08:25.505 --> 00:08:26.589 position:50% align:center
Eep!

00:08:29.634 --> 00:08:32.178 position:50% align:center
Hey! Stop screwing
with us and come out!

00:08:32.262 --> 00:08:35.849 position:50% align:center
You think your feeble
projectiles intimidate me?

00:08:35.932 --> 00:08:38.309 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Um, hello. Can I help you?

00:08:38.393 --> 00:08:39.436 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:41.021 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Uhh...

00:08:43.606 --> 00:08:46.317 position:50% align:center
[sighs] <i>LÃ¡tom.</i>

00:08:46.401 --> 00:08:48.278 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
I'm sorry for being so rude.

00:08:48.361 --> 00:08:50.739 position:50% align:center
We're here from Special
Fire Force Company 8.

00:08:50.822 --> 00:08:54.993 position:50% align:center
I'm Shinra Kusababe,
First Class Fire Soldier.

00:08:55.076 --> 00:08:56.703 position:50% align:center
And I'm a hero, too.

00:08:56.786 --> 00:08:59.706 position:50% align:center
Another visit from another
Fire Force Company, huh?

00:08:59.789 --> 00:09:01.082 position:50% align:center
You're here to
recruit the master,

00:09:01.166 --> 00:09:04.169 position:50% align:center
but he won't let
you in, I assume?

00:09:04.252 --> 00:09:05.920 position:50% align:center
Hello? Master?

00:09:06.004 --> 00:09:08.673 position:50% align:center
I've returned with the
parts you asked for.

00:09:11.843 --> 00:09:14.804 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN] Yu, I told you not to
call me "Master," remember?

00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:18.350 position:50% align:center
It's either "Vulcan" or
"Dirtbag." Take your pick.

00:09:18.433 --> 00:09:19.893 position:50% align:center
Vulcan, then.

00:09:19.976 --> 00:09:23.730 position:50% align:center
But, anyway, um, the parts that
you needed are in that bag.

00:09:24.981 --> 00:09:26.316 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Hold on, dirtbag!

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:27.692 position:50% align:center
[BOTH yell]

00:09:29.152 --> 00:09:30.695 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Enough with the ca-- Huh?

00:09:30.779 --> 00:09:33.823 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR] What? There's
a second can assailant?

00:09:34.866 --> 00:09:38.703 position:50% align:center
I have nothin' to say to
you Fire Soldiers. Buzz off!

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.374 position:50% align:center
He really doesn't like us, huh?

00:09:42.457 --> 00:09:44.834 position:50% align:center
Although I guess we were warned.

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:48.463 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
We didn't even say anything

00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:50.256 position:50% align:center
and he's already
picking a fight.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:53.051 position:50% align:center
Let's go. This isn't gonna work.

00:09:53.134 --> 00:09:54.636 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Hold on a sec!

00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:59.933 position:50% align:center
I'll hear you out.
If you guys'll talk to me.

00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:05.939 position:50% align:center
[banging]

00:10:06.022 --> 00:10:09.109 position:50% align:center
It almost sounds like he's
playing drums in there.

00:10:09.192 --> 00:10:12.278 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Did Vulcan make all
this crazy stuff lyin' around?

00:10:12.362 --> 00:10:14.197 position:50% align:center
Yeah, pretty much.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.991 position:50% align:center
There's projects from his
father and grandfather, too.

00:10:17.075 --> 00:10:19.202 position:50% align:center
Wait, and you bring him parts?

00:10:19.285 --> 00:10:21.663 position:50% align:center
Is he forcing you to
do all his busywork?

00:10:21.746 --> 00:10:24.332 position:50% align:center
He doesn't have to
force me. I want to.

00:10:24.416 --> 00:10:29.045 position:50% align:center
It's not like official, but, uh,
I'm sort of Vulcan's apprentice.

00:10:29.129 --> 00:10:30.839 position:50% align:center
I've always liked
tinkering with machines

00:10:30.922 --> 00:10:32.674 position:50% align:center
and I admire Vulcan's work,

00:10:32.757 --> 00:10:36.219 position:50% align:center
so I asked him if I could lend
a hand around the workshop.

00:10:36.302 --> 00:10:40.932 position:50% align:center
That was the plan, but I'm
mostly running errands now.

00:10:41.016 --> 00:10:43.560 position:50% align:center
So did something happen
to change things?

00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:47.522 position:50% align:center
[YU] Vulcan's talent
is the real deal.

00:10:47.605 --> 00:10:52.569 position:50% align:center
His work shows precision, speed,
and above all else, creativity.

00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:56.364 position:50% align:center
He's the ultimate technician,
with no weak points.

00:10:56.448 --> 00:10:59.868 position:50% align:center
I'm not really into the whole
skull thing, but whatever.

00:11:01.619 --> 00:11:05.040 position:50% align:center
Anyway, as you can imagine,
he's in high demand.

00:11:05.123 --> 00:11:07.917 position:50% align:center
From Haijima and you guys.

00:11:08.001 --> 00:11:11.546 position:50% align:center
But Vulcan turns everyone
away on the spot.

00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:14.257 position:50% align:center
Haijima wasn't too happy
about this, of course,

00:11:14.341 --> 00:11:16.051 position:50% align:center
so they pulled some strings,

00:11:16.134 --> 00:11:19.387 position:50% align:center
and now, no more merchants
will work with him.

00:11:19.471 --> 00:11:21.973 position:50% align:center
He can't get materials anywhere.

00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:27.103 position:50% align:center
[YU] But I've been able to get
him most of the parts he needs

00:11:27.187 --> 00:11:29.522 position:50% align:center
by running around to
different junk shops.

00:11:29.606 --> 00:11:32.859 position:50% align:center
I guess I'd hate Haijima,
too, if I were him.

00:11:32.942 --> 00:11:37.072 position:50% align:center
I dunno. He hates Haijima
and the Fire Force a lot.

00:11:37.155 --> 00:11:40.200 position:50% align:center
I haven't heard the details,
but it's quite the grudge.

00:11:40.283 --> 00:11:43.244 position:50% align:center
Trust me, we aren't like
the other companies.

00:11:43.328 --> 00:11:46.122 position:50% align:center
You have my word on that.

00:11:46.206 --> 00:11:49.542 position:50% align:center
Please. Can you at least
ask Vulcan to hear us out?

00:11:49.626 --> 00:11:51.294 position:50% align:center
Just this once.

00:11:52.379 --> 00:11:53.880 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Maybe you're right.

00:11:53.963 --> 00:11:56.466 position:50% align:center
I have to admit, you're
nothing like the others

00:11:56.549 --> 00:11:58.677 position:50% align:center
who came to recruit him.

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.930 position:50% align:center
I'll take you in.
It's worth a shot!

00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:14.109 position:50% align:center
Should we just barge
in without asking?

00:12:14.192 --> 00:12:17.654 position:50% align:center
Vulcan might yell at me
about it, but it'll be fine.

00:12:20.448 --> 00:12:23.076 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Wait, it was
a machine all along?

00:12:24.077 --> 00:12:27.997 position:50% align:center
Owie! Another one?
How many--?

00:12:28.081 --> 00:12:30.500 position:50% align:center
Actually, that one
was thrown by Lisa.

00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:32.210 position:50% align:center
She lives here with Vulcan.

00:12:32.293 --> 00:12:34.129 position:50% align:center
Yu! Come on!

00:12:34.212 --> 00:12:37.674 position:50% align:center
You know better than to let
the Fire Force in here!

00:12:37.757 --> 00:12:39.968 position:50% align:center
[YU]
My arm! You're breaking it!

00:12:46.057 --> 00:12:48.810 position:50% align:center
I dunno about all the
banging, but he's fast!

00:12:48.893 --> 00:12:51.354 position:50% align:center
I've never seen that
technique before.

00:12:54.274 --> 00:12:55.942 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:12:59.612 --> 00:13:01.364 position:50% align:center
All right! It's done!

00:13:01.448 --> 00:13:04.117 position:50% align:center
Why would you kick something
you just made across the floor?

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.493 position:50% align:center
What if it breaks?

00:13:05.577 --> 00:13:07.829 position:50% align:center
A machine that breaks
from one kick is defective,

00:13:07.912 --> 00:13:09.080 position:50% align:center
far as I'm concerned.

00:13:09.164 --> 00:13:11.875 position:50% align:center
Hey! You little rats!
Who invited you in here?

00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.793 position:50% align:center
We wanna talk, that's all.

00:13:13.877 --> 00:13:15.795 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
Hey, Yu, what're you doin'?!

00:13:15.879 --> 00:13:17.964 position:50% align:center
Bring some drinks already!

00:13:18.048 --> 00:13:19.382 position:50% align:center
Sir!

00:13:19.466 --> 00:13:21.676 position:50% align:center
Oh. Thank you.

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.054 position:50% align:center
Yeah, right!

00:13:24.137 --> 00:13:25.972 position:50% align:center
Just five minutes, okay?

00:13:26.056 --> 00:13:28.975 position:50% align:center
I heard enough from the Fire
Force to last a lifetime.

00:13:29.059 --> 00:13:31.394 position:50% align:center
So get your ass outta my shop!

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:33.480 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Moron.

00:13:33.563 --> 00:13:36.733 position:50% align:center
[alarm wailing]

00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:39.110 position:50% align:center
Vul, looks like he's back.

00:13:42.864 --> 00:13:44.449 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
I'll handle it.

00:13:47.202 --> 00:13:48.745 position:50% align:center
[LISA]
Are you okay alone?

00:13:48.828 --> 00:13:50.455 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
It'll be fine.

00:14:02.133 --> 00:14:03.968 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
That's the captain of the 3rd!

00:14:04.052 --> 00:14:06.221 position:50% align:center
Their company is in
tight with Haijima.

00:14:06.304 --> 00:14:09.516 position:50% align:center
Does that mean they're gonna
nab Vulcan before us?

00:14:09.599 --> 00:14:10.433 position:50% align:center
No way.

00:14:10.517 --> 00:14:12.018 position:50% align:center
If Vulcan goes with them,

00:14:12.102 --> 00:14:14.771 position:50% align:center
there's no way his dream
will ever come true.

00:14:25.532 --> 00:14:28.284 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] How has business
been these days?

00:14:28.368 --> 00:14:31.287 position:50% align:center
Slow, it seems.

00:14:31.371 --> 00:14:33.206 position:50% align:center
You still have a
fondness for animals,

00:14:33.289 --> 00:14:35.083 position:50% align:center
like when you were a child.

00:14:35.166 --> 00:14:36.209 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
Tch.

00:14:36.292 --> 00:14:38.461 position:50% align:center
That was a dirty
trick you pulled!

00:14:38.545 --> 00:14:41.131 position:50% align:center
I know you're the one who cut
me off from my suppliers!

00:14:41.214 --> 00:14:42.716 position:50% align:center
You think that's gonna work?

00:14:42.799 --> 00:14:45.051 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] I needed to teach you
it takes more than blueprints

00:14:45.135 --> 00:14:46.761 position:50% align:center
to build something.

00:14:46.845 --> 00:14:49.305 position:50% align:center
Stop being stubborn and join us.

00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:51.683 position:50% align:center
I assure you, you'll
have all the materials

00:14:51.766 --> 00:14:53.435 position:50% align:center
you could ever dream of.

00:14:53.518 --> 00:14:55.020 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN] I wouldn't even
change a lightbulb

00:14:55.103 --> 00:14:57.522 position:50% align:center
for your filthy company.

00:14:57.605 --> 00:15:00.734 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] This is your
final warning, Vulcan.

00:15:00.817 --> 00:15:04.404 position:50% align:center
If you fail to heed it,
you can only blame yourself.

00:15:04.487 --> 00:15:05.947 position:50% align:center
What, you gonna kill me?

00:15:06.031 --> 00:15:08.992 position:50% align:center
Like you did with my
dad and my granddad?

00:15:11.286 --> 00:15:12.871 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
What are you talking about?

00:15:12.954 --> 00:15:15.248 position:50% align:center
Piss off, you backstabber!

00:15:16.207 --> 00:15:17.917 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
Such a pity.

00:15:18.001 --> 00:15:20.795 position:50% align:center
All your talent wasting
away in this scrapyard

00:15:20.879 --> 00:15:24.090 position:50% align:center
when you could accomplish
so much more.

00:15:24.174 --> 00:15:25.342 position:50% align:center
Speaking of wasteful,

00:15:25.425 --> 00:15:28.261 position:50% align:center
your plan with the animals
will never work.

00:15:28.345 --> 00:15:30.180 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
Shut up!

00:15:30.263 --> 00:15:32.557 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
A child's dream.

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:35.310 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN] You sold off all your
dreams for money and power!

00:15:35.393 --> 00:15:37.187 position:50% align:center
What the hell do you know?

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:40.106 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] You're not being
bold, you're being selfish.

00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:42.192 position:50% align:center
If you offered your
talents to the Empire,

00:15:42.275 --> 00:15:45.695 position:50% align:center
imagine how many lives
could be saved.

00:15:45.779 --> 00:15:50.325 position:50% align:center
Your dream is worthless, It's
too pathetic to even laugh at.

00:15:54.329 --> 00:15:57.582 position:50% align:center
What's your problem? I thought
I told you to get outta here.

00:15:57.665 --> 00:16:00.293 position:50% align:center
Sure it was smart to piss
off Haijima like that?

00:16:00.377 --> 00:16:02.337 position:50% align:center
It's not your
problem either way.

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:04.214 position:50% align:center
Actually, it is.

00:16:04.297 --> 00:16:06.591 position:50% align:center
The 8th was formed to
investigate the Fire Force

00:16:06.675 --> 00:16:08.134 position:50% align:center
from the inside.

00:16:08.218 --> 00:16:09.552 position:50% align:center
We're not like the
other companies

00:16:09.636 --> 00:16:12.305 position:50% align:center
who are tied down by
big organizations.

00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:14.974 position:50% align:center
The only thing we care
about is helping people.

00:16:15.058 --> 00:16:19.145 position:50% align:center
So talk to us. Maybe we
can help you, too.

00:16:22.691 --> 00:16:23.942 position:50% align:center
Who turned that thing on?

00:16:24.025 --> 00:16:26.069 position:50% align:center
[BOTH chuckle]

00:16:26.152 --> 00:16:28.988 position:50% align:center
Oops. Guess I must've
touched it someplace weird.

00:16:29.072 --> 00:16:31.157 position:50% align:center
We're having a serious
conversation here.

00:16:31.241 --> 00:16:33.618 position:50% align:center
Stop touching things
in weird places.

00:16:33.702 --> 00:16:35.453 position:50% align:center
What does this button do?

00:16:35.537 --> 00:16:37.664 position:50% align:center
Nothing good. Don't press it!

00:16:37.747 --> 00:16:39.207 position:50% align:center
What's your deal?

00:16:41.835 --> 00:16:44.170 position:50% align:center
Hey. How do you get
this thing to stop?

00:16:44.254 --> 00:16:45.422 position:50% align:center
Don't ask me!

00:16:45.505 --> 00:16:46.923 position:50% align:center
[IRIS giggles]

00:16:47.007 --> 00:16:48.133 position:50% align:center
What's this one do?

00:16:48.216 --> 00:16:49.968 position:50% align:center
Uh! Get away from there!

00:16:50.051 --> 00:16:51.678 position:50% align:center
[IRIS]
Boom.

00:16:51.761 --> 00:16:53.930 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
The elephant!

00:16:54.889 --> 00:16:57.517 position:50% align:center
What does this
little round guy do?

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:58.810 position:50% align:center
Don't you dare.

00:16:58.893 --> 00:17:01.688 position:50% align:center
Oh. I'm sorry.

00:17:01.771 --> 00:17:04.482 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN laughs]

00:17:04.566 --> 00:17:07.527 position:50% align:center
How do you guys even function?
You're totally nuts!

00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:10.363 position:50% align:center
And I'm supposed to believe
you're Fire Soldiers?

00:17:10.447 --> 00:17:11.531 position:50% align:center
All right, fine.

00:17:11.614 --> 00:17:12.824 position:50% align:center
You're probably
gonna get in trouble

00:17:12.907 --> 00:17:15.452 position:50% align:center
if you go back
empty-handed, am I right?

00:17:16.411 --> 00:17:17.871 position:50% align:center
I won't join your team,

00:17:17.954 --> 00:17:20.040 position:50% align:center
but I will show you somethin'
to make your trip worth it.

00:17:20.123 --> 00:17:22.876 position:50% align:center
After that, you leave me alone.

00:17:22.959 --> 00:17:24.085 position:50% align:center
I'm listening.

00:17:24.169 --> 00:17:26.379 position:50% align:center
I haven't gotten to see
this in a long time.

00:17:26.463 --> 00:17:29.257 position:50% align:center
Hey. Should I bring
this with me or what?

00:17:29.341 --> 00:17:31.301 position:50% align:center
Just put it down.

00:17:33.678 --> 00:17:35.305 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
That's enough room.

00:17:35.388 --> 00:17:38.183 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR] So what is it?
Some invention of yours?

00:17:38.266 --> 00:17:42.562 position:50% align:center
When I was little, I made this
with my dad and my granddad.

00:17:42.645 --> 00:17:44.814 position:50% align:center
Now shut up and watch.

00:17:49.361 --> 00:17:51.488 position:50% align:center
I wanna make things
people have never seen.

00:17:51.571 --> 00:17:54.032 position:50% align:center
I won't settle for
something ordinary.

00:17:57.786 --> 00:17:59.412 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR, IRIS gasp]

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:12.175 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
Not too bad, huh?

00:18:12.258 --> 00:18:13.468 position:50% align:center
Would you believe
that there used to be

00:18:13.551 --> 00:18:17.305 position:50% align:center
over 1.7 million species
of animals in the world?

00:18:17.389 --> 00:18:19.683 position:50% align:center
This is unreal.

00:18:20.809 --> 00:18:23.395 position:50% align:center
[IRIS] Those are
elephants, aren't they?

00:18:31.361 --> 00:18:33.571 position:50% align:center
What are those?

00:18:33.655 --> 00:18:35.240 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
Migratory birds.

00:18:35.323 --> 00:18:37.701 position:50% align:center
They used to fly from
continent to continent,

00:18:37.784 --> 00:18:39.494 position:50% align:center
but with the way things are now,

00:18:39.577 --> 00:18:42.122 position:50% align:center
there'd be nowhere
left for them to go.

00:18:44.916 --> 00:18:47.585 position:50% align:center
I don't understand
this feeling.

00:18:47.669 --> 00:18:52.424 position:50% align:center
But for some strange reason,
I can't stop crying.

00:18:52.507 --> 00:18:55.427 position:50% align:center
Amaterasu can only
generate enough power

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:56.970 position:50% align:center
for the Empire's people,

00:18:57.053 --> 00:18:59.097 position:50% align:center
so I wanna create
a new energy source.

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:03.059 position:50% align:center
Something even stronger that
can bring the whole world back.

00:19:03.143 --> 00:19:05.437 position:50% align:center
And I'll bring all of the
animals who went extinct

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.022 position:50% align:center
back to life with it.

00:19:07.105 --> 00:19:10.525 position:50% align:center
That's the dream
I'm fighting for.

00:19:10.608 --> 00:19:12.694 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] This is someone
who wants to use his power

00:19:12.777 --> 00:19:16.781 position:50% align:center
to save lives in a way
no one else can.

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:21.286 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Captain Obi,
you had the right idea.

00:19:21.369 --> 00:19:24.039 position:50% align:center
Vulcan is perfect
for Company 8.

00:19:44.017 --> 00:19:46.644 position:50% align:center
Every time I watch,
it blows me away.

00:19:46.728 --> 00:19:48.605 position:50% align:center
So, you guys,
what did you think?

00:19:48.688 --> 00:19:51.024 position:50% align:center
Honestly, it touched my heart.

00:19:51.107 --> 00:19:53.568 position:50% align:center
So cool.

00:19:53.651 --> 00:19:54.903 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Listen, Vulcan,

00:19:54.986 --> 00:19:57.238 position:50% align:center
I know you'd love it
at Company 8.

00:19:57.322 --> 00:19:58.490 position:50% align:center
Please stop by.

00:19:58.573 --> 00:20:01.785 position:50% align:center
Just talk to our captain
and you'll understand.

00:20:01.868 --> 00:20:03.036 position:50% align:center
Sorry.

00:20:03.119 --> 00:20:04.788 position:50% align:center
Nothing you say will
ever convince me

00:20:04.871 --> 00:20:08.875 position:50% align:center
to side with anyone
under Haijima's thumb.

00:20:08.958 --> 00:20:10.960 position:50% align:center
I'll find my own way.

00:20:12.128 --> 00:20:14.047 position:50% align:center
[LISA]
Same thing every time.

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:16.675 position:50% align:center
So how did you meet Vulcan?

00:20:16.758 --> 00:20:18.927 position:50% align:center
Both my parents died in a fire.

00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:21.763 position:50% align:center
An Infernal destroyed my life.

00:20:21.846 --> 00:20:23.890 position:50% align:center
Later, my relatives died, too.

00:20:23.973 --> 00:20:26.142 position:50% align:center
I was about to be
put in a convent,

00:20:26.226 --> 00:20:28.728 position:50% align:center
but the last thing
I wanna be is a nun.

00:20:28.812 --> 00:20:31.981 position:50% align:center
Oh, I'm sorry.
You're not a nun, are you?

00:20:32.065 --> 00:20:34.651 position:50% align:center
[IRIS]
Uh. It's fine.

00:20:34.734 --> 00:20:39.739 position:50% align:center
I ran away.
Straight off to nowhere.

00:20:39.823 --> 00:20:41.616 position:50% align:center
I had nothing.

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:44.411 position:50% align:center
I wandered here to the
scrapyard looking for a place

00:20:44.494 --> 00:20:46.830 position:50% align:center
where I could stay
outta the rain.

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:51.751 position:50% align:center
[LISA] Then Vulcan found
me and took me in.

00:20:52.794 --> 00:20:55.213 position:50% align:center
He has a kind heart, huh?

00:20:55.296 --> 00:20:58.758 position:50% align:center
[LISA] Yeah, he does.
Too kind, maybe.

00:20:58.842 --> 00:21:01.845 position:50% align:center
Vulcan will take in anyone
who needs his help.

00:21:01.928 --> 00:21:03.179 position:50% align:center
And animals, too.

00:21:03.263 --> 00:21:06.057 position:50% align:center
He will work hard to take
care of all of them.

00:21:06.141 --> 00:21:07.934 position:50% align:center
Whose grave is this?

00:21:08.018 --> 00:21:11.354 position:50% align:center
[YU] Vulcan's father's and
his grandfather's, too.

00:21:11.438 --> 00:21:13.898 position:50% align:center
Both of them went Infernal
at the same time.

00:21:13.982 --> 00:21:16.526 position:50% align:center
That isn't something that
happens often, right?

00:21:16.609 --> 00:21:19.988 position:50% align:center
Vulcan thinks Giovanni had
something to do with it.

00:21:21.072 --> 00:21:23.491 position:50% align:center
And does he have a good
reason to suspect him?

00:21:23.575 --> 00:21:27.662 position:50% align:center
Vulcan's grandfather had
taken on two apprentices.

00:21:27.746 --> 00:21:32.375 position:50% align:center
One of them was Vulcan's father,
and the other one was Giovanni.

00:21:32.459 --> 00:21:34.127 position:50% align:center
Right after his father
and grandfather

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:35.837 position:50% align:center
died unnatural deaths,

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:38.048 position:50% align:center
Giovanni went to
work for Haijima.

00:21:38.131 --> 00:21:41.551 position:50% align:center
That's something that was
forbidden by their master.

00:21:41.634 --> 00:21:43.219 position:50% align:center
Oh. Why was it forbidden?

00:21:43.303 --> 00:21:45.055 position:50% align:center
Something with his family.

00:21:45.138 --> 00:21:47.223 position:50% align:center
Apparently, they have a
bad history with Haijima,

00:21:47.307 --> 00:21:49.059 position:50% align:center
going way back.

00:21:51.811 --> 00:21:55.357 position:50% align:center
[LISA] Nice chat, but I'd better
get started on Vul's dinner.

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:58.860 position:50% align:center
I hate to say it, but you
really should give up.

00:21:58.943 --> 00:22:00.904 position:50% align:center
Sorry I couldn't
be more helpful.

00:22:00.987 --> 00:22:02.947 position:50% align:center
Don't say that. We just need--

00:22:04.199 --> 00:22:05.700 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
The time has come.

00:22:05.784 --> 00:22:08.203 position:50% align:center
Vulcan must be killed.

00:22:11.498 --> 00:22:15.126 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] It's that same feeling
I had back in Asakusa.

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:19.339 position:50% align:center
That time, it was Lieutenant
Konro calling out for help.

00:22:19.422 --> 00:22:22.967 position:50% align:center
This time, it's Doctor
Giovanni out for blood.

00:22:23.051 --> 00:22:25.303 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I think this is a bust.

00:22:25.387 --> 00:22:29.057 position:50% align:center
Let's head back to the station
and see what's next.

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:31.685 position:50% align:center
We can't leave Vulcan
on his own right now.

00:22:31.768 --> 00:22:34.187 position:50% align:center
Call it my "hero's intuition."
