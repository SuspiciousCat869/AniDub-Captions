Hey, Beni.

00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:34.719 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Barely.

Why, Konro?

If you had let me
fight with you,

00:01:44.062 --> 00:01:46.064 position:50% align:center
then you wouldn't have had
to push yourself so far

Aw, come on, Beni.

00:01:55.573 --> 00:01:56.866 position:50% align:center
I took you outta the fight

You're Konro, yes?

00:02:44.664 --> 00:02:47.459 position:50% align:center
I'm told that you're
a local leader.

00:02:47.542 --> 00:02:50.211 position:50% align:center
By order of the Emperor,
your "Hikeshi" fire brigade

00:02:50.295 --> 00:02:54.966 position:50% align:center
is hereby inducted into the
Special Fire Force as Company 7.

[KONRO, BENIMARU gasp]

00:02:56.551 --> 00:02:59.220 position:50% align:center
Screw you. You're just afraid

00:02:59.304 --> 00:03:01.306 position:50% align:center
Beni, calm down for a sec.

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:03.308 position:50% align:center
You want us to join you guys?

00:03:03.391 --> 00:03:06.436 position:50% align:center
Well, I'd like to hear what
we stand to gain from it.

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.396 position:50% align:center
[HAGUE] You'd remain
an autonomous company,

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.607 position:50% align:center
but gain the Empire's support.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.942 position:50% align:center
In addition to new funding,
you'd receive equipment,

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:15.362 position:50% align:center
supplies, and skilled soldiers.

00:03:15.445 --> 00:03:19.657 position:50% align:center
I don't believe you'll find any
reasons to decline this offer.

00:03:19.741 --> 00:03:22.702 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I can't give you
an answer immediately.

00:03:22.786 --> 00:03:24.996 position:50% align:center
I need time to consider.

00:03:32.754 --> 00:03:34.005 position:50% align:center
It will be quite reassuring

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:37.509 position:50% align:center
to have brave soldiers
like you on the Force.

00:03:37.592 --> 00:03:40.679 position:50% align:center
I await your favorable response.

00:03:43.932 --> 00:03:46.434 position:50% align:center

an Imperial lap dog?!

00:03:46.518 --> 00:03:47.894 position:50% align:center
[KONRO]
If we'd had the resources

00:03:47.977 --> 00:03:49.479 position:50% align:center
of an official company,

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:52.232 position:50% align:center
we probably could've
prevented a lotta damage

00:03:52.315 --> 00:03:54.609 position:50% align:center
and saved a lotta lives.

00:03:54.693 --> 00:03:57.487 position:50% align:center
If the Empire wants
to exploit us, fine.

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.281 position:50% align:center
We can just exploit
them right back.

00:04:18.842 --> 00:04:21.302 position:50% align:center
It's my own fault
I ended up like this.

00:04:21.386 --> 00:04:23.555 position:50% align:center
Waka had no say.

00:04:23.638 --> 00:04:25.724 position:50% align:center
He's got no reason
to feel guilty.

00:04:25.807 --> 00:04:29.436 position:50% align:center
You put yourself through all
that to protect Captain Shinmon?

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:36.276 position:50% align:center
Waka doesn't realize it,
but he's a natural leader.

00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:38.278 position:50% align:center
I don't regret taking
a fall for him then,

00:04:38.361 --> 00:04:41.197 position:50% align:center
or breaking up your fight today.

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:43.742 position:50% align:center
As soldiers, you
should understand.

00:04:43.825 --> 00:04:45.952 position:50% align:center
This life of mine
isn't worth much,

00:04:46.036 --> 00:04:49.664 position:50% align:center
so if I can help Waka,
I'll put it on the line.

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.046 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't do that.

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:57.255 position:50% align:center

Huh?

00:04:58.214 --> 00:05:02.469 position:50% align:center
My family, the people
I loved most, are gone.

00:05:02.552 --> 00:05:05.764 position:50% align:center
At this point, I can
barely remember them.

00:05:05.847 --> 00:05:07.515 position:50% align:center

as a worthless one.

much as anyone else's.

00:18:57.721 --> 00:18:59.014 position:50% align:center
Stay outta this, will ya?

00:18:59.097 --> 00:19:01.391 position:50% align:center
Why don't you stay out of it?!

00:19:05.645 --> 00:19:07.147 position:50% align:center
[ARROW]
Since you can block my arrows,

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:09.524 position:50% align:center
I'll use ones that explode.

00:19:14.738 --> 00:19:16.197 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
Get off, ya dumb Devil.

00:19:16.281 --> 00:19:17.782 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Well, I'm thinkin' you
should just stay down there

00:19:17.866 --> 00:19:19.242 position:50% align:center
and say good knight.

00:19:22.871 --> 00:19:24.497 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR coughs]

00:19:24.581 --> 00:19:26.583 position:50% align:center
The big guy's comin' at us.

00:19:33.882 --> 00:19:35.967 position:50% align:center
We need to fight as
a team like they do,

00:19:36.051 --> 00:19:37.052 position:50% align:center
or we're finished.

00:19:37.135 --> 00:19:39.304 position:50% align:center
You don't have to
tell me, I get it.

00:19:39.387 --> 00:19:41.431 position:50% align:center
You never get anything, I--

00:19:43.808 --> 00:19:46.269 position:50% align:center
[BOTH sigh]

00:19:46.353 --> 00:19:48.355 position:50% align:center
I'm Puts-Up-with-Stuff-
That-Sucks Man.

00:19:48.438 --> 00:19:49.731 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR chuckles]

00:19:53.109 --> 00:19:54.944 position:50% align:center
Teamwork is fine in theory,

00:19:55.028 --> 00:19:57.238 position:50% align:center
but we'll never be
on the same page.

00:19:57.322 --> 00:19:59.032 position:50% align:center
Let's try and split
these two up.

00:19:59.115 --> 00:20:01.785 position:50% align:center
That does seem like
the better plan.

00:20:01.868 --> 00:20:03.161 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
You've got longer reach,

00:20:03.244 --> 00:20:04.662 position:50% align:center
so you take the hooded guy.

00:20:04.746 --> 00:20:08.541 position:50% align:center
I can get in close with my
speed, so I'll take the archer.

00:20:08.625 --> 00:20:10.960 position:50% align:center
Mr. Hoodie always moves
to protect the archer,

00:20:11.044 --> 00:20:13.421 position:50% align:center
so we'll have to peel him away.

00:20:13.505 --> 00:20:14.381 position:50% align:center
Let's go.

00:20:14.464 --> 00:20:15.465 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:20:21.471 --> 00:20:22.597 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
The reason they're winning

00:20:22.681 --> 00:20:24.724 position:50% align:center
is 'cause they don't get
in each other's way.

00:20:24.808 --> 00:20:27.435 position:50% align:center
One stays back, and the
other keeps forward.

00:20:27.519 --> 00:20:30.271 position:50% align:center
We need to come up with
a similar formation.

00:20:30.355 --> 00:20:31.523 position:50% align:center
I know.

00:20:31.606 --> 00:20:33.149 position:50% align:center
What now?

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:35.819 position:50% align:center
This oughtta work.

00:20:42.784 --> 00:20:43.910 position:50% align:center
Gotcha!

00:20:45.912 --> 00:20:47.956 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
You won't get away from me.

00:20:49.874 --> 00:20:50.917 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:20:56.423 --> 00:20:57.716 position:50% align:center
Forfeit.

00:20:57.799 --> 00:20:59.592 position:50% align:center
I mean, forbear.

00:21:05.056 --> 00:21:07.559 position:50% align:center
Fall back! Go!

00:21:07.642 --> 00:21:09.019 position:50% align:center
Not this time!

00:21:09.102 --> 00:21:11.062 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:21:11.146 --> 00:21:12.439 position:50% align:center
No!

00:21:26.578 --> 00:21:28.913 position:50% align:center
Beni!

00:21:30.915 --> 00:21:33.543 position:50% align:center
[KONRO]
Beni!

00:21:39.591 --> 00:21:42.344 position:50% align:center
[INFERNAL A snarls]

00:21:48.683 --> 00:21:53.104 position:50% align:center
I got no clue who you were,
but I'll end your suffering.

00:22:01.196 --> 00:22:05.158 position:50% align:center
[groaning]

00:22:05.241 --> 00:22:07.410 position:50% align:center
Way to hang in there, friend.
