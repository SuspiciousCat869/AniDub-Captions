00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:28.737 position:50% align:center
[IRIS] As the world man had
built was buried in ash,

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.280 position:50% align:center
a leader appeared.

00:00:30.363 --> 00:00:35.243 position:50% align:center
A man who would later be
known as Raffles the 1st.

00:00:35.326 --> 00:00:37.662 position:50% align:center
Raffles and his disciples
embarked on a quest

00:00:37.746 --> 00:00:41.041 position:50% align:center
to find new light, and they did.

00:00:41.124 --> 00:00:44.336 position:50% align:center
What Raffles found was
an unsullied flame.

00:00:44.419 --> 00:00:47.213 position:50% align:center
The spark that would
kindle an empire.

00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:23.333 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] It won't be long
before someone in the Fire Force

00:01:23.416 --> 00:01:26.002 position:50% align:center
figures out we're down
here in the Nether.

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:29.464 position:50% align:center
[SHO] You're right.
But that's to our advantage.

00:01:29.547 --> 00:01:32.759 position:50% align:center
Yona's at the gate.
Tell him to be on guard.

00:01:32.842 --> 00:01:35.637 position:50% align:center
[MIRAGE] We'll assist with
preparations and reconnaissance.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.806 position:50% align:center
There's no need
for reconnaissance.

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:41.851 position:50% align:center
Our enemy is the knave
with the Adolla Link.

00:01:43.853 --> 00:01:45.063 position:50% align:center
That was close.

00:01:45.146 --> 00:01:46.606 position:50% align:center
Hey, Shinra.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.651 position:50% align:center
You can read your book after
you finish picking up your toys.

00:01:51.027 --> 00:01:52.237 position:50% align:center
One minute.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.115 position:50% align:center
Are you sure? Seems kinda risky.

00:01:55.198 --> 00:01:56.991 position:50% align:center
You know bad boys get
taken to the Nether.

00:01:57.075 --> 00:01:58.368 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA gasps]

00:02:05.834 --> 00:02:09.295 position:50% align:center
So dumb. Why would I be
afraid of the Nether?

00:02:36.197 --> 00:02:39.284 position:50% align:center
You don't have to be scared
of getting taken to the Nether.

00:02:39.367 --> 00:02:42.620 position:50% align:center
'Cause your big brother
will swoop in to save you.

00:02:43.705 --> 00:02:47.584 position:50% align:center
They're in the Nether?
You're sure?

00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:50.128 position:50% align:center
Based on Licht's analysis
of what clues were left

00:02:50.211 --> 00:02:52.380 position:50% align:center
after the attack on
Vulcan's workshop,

00:02:52.464 --> 00:02:54.507 position:50% align:center
we've determined that
the Evangelists' followers

00:02:54.591 --> 00:02:56.176 position:50% align:center
are hiding out underground.

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:58.178 position:50% align:center
The Holy Sol Temple tell us

00:02:58.261 --> 00:02:59.888 position:50% align:center
the Nether is a
place far removed

00:02:59.971 --> 00:03:01.473 position:50% align:center
from the great Sol's light.

00:03:01.556 --> 00:03:03.683 position:50% align:center
Those caverns are both
dark and unclean.

00:03:03.767 --> 00:03:06.436 position:50% align:center
[OBI] For reasons we just
heard from Sister Iris,

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.522 position:50% align:center
the Nether, which has roots
beneath most of Tokyo,

00:03:09.606 --> 00:03:11.316 position:50% align:center
is considered forbidden ground.

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:13.276 position:50% align:center
This of course makes
it the perfect place

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.904 position:50% align:center
for a band of cultists
to set up shop.

00:03:15.987 --> 00:03:17.697 position:50% align:center
As for what the
Nether looks like,

00:03:17.781 --> 00:03:20.033 position:50% align:center
it's comprised of the
now-defunct railway tunnels

00:03:20.116 --> 00:03:23.161 position:50% align:center
that used to run
throughout the city.

00:03:23.244 --> 00:03:25.997 position:50% align:center
My understanding was that
most of the tunnels collapsed

00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:28.124 position:50% align:center
on the day of the
Great Cataclysm,

00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:30.168 position:50% align:center
but it's starting to look
like more of them survived

00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:32.379 position:50% align:center
than one would expect.

00:03:32.462 --> 00:03:34.673 position:50% align:center
I looked at what
Giovanni left behind,

00:03:34.756 --> 00:03:37.592 position:50% align:center
cross-referenced that with a map
of artificial combustion sites,

00:03:37.676 --> 00:03:40.637 position:50% align:center
and found where they are.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.847 position:50% align:center
Tomorrow, we're gonna bust
into the secret lair

00:03:42.931 --> 00:03:46.267 position:50% align:center
of the bastards who've been
burning innocent people alive.

00:03:46.351 --> 00:03:47.727 position:50% align:center
We'll knock down
all their doors

00:03:47.811 --> 00:03:50.855 position:50% align:center
and find the secret
of human combustion.

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:55.110 position:50% align:center
Expect a full-on battle,
with all our lives at stake.

00:03:56.736 --> 00:03:57.862 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:57.946 --> 00:04:00.365 position:50% align:center
We're bringin' your
brother home, Shinra?

00:04:00.448 --> 00:04:01.783 position:50% align:center
Sir!

00:04:01.866 --> 00:04:05.787 position:50% align:center
Okay. Let's get ready
for tomorrow. Dismissed!

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.458 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Tamaki. You have a minute?

00:04:10.542 --> 00:04:11.710 position:50% align:center
Sir.

00:04:12.961 --> 00:04:15.088 position:50% align:center
Are you sure you wanna do this?

00:04:19.551 --> 00:04:24.055 position:50% align:center
High-ho... Silver.

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.266 position:50% align:center
High-ho...

00:04:29.894 --> 00:04:33.273 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
It's so hot. Where am I?

00:04:41.031 --> 00:04:42.866 position:50% align:center
Sister Iris?

00:04:50.415 --> 00:04:51.750 position:50% align:center
Earthquake.

00:04:51.833 --> 00:04:54.002 position:50% align:center
Doesn't seem like an
especially big one.

00:04:54.085 --> 00:04:56.963 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but they're
getting more common.

00:05:32.707 --> 00:05:34.668 position:50% align:center
<i>take what you got and leave now</i>

00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:36.836 position:50% align:center

00:05:40.674 --> 00:05:42.634 position:50% align:center

<i>he wants you, don't you?</i>

00:05:48.556 --> 00:05:52.519 position:50% align:center

<i>MAYDAY</i>

00:06:32.017 --> 00:06:35.645 position:50% align:center
<i>MAYDAY</i>

00:06:47.032 --> 00:06:49.701 position:50% align:center
Guess this job is a
first for both of us.

00:06:49.784 --> 00:06:51.828 position:50% align:center
Kinda gives ya the jitters, huh?

00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:54.414 position:50% align:center
Can't say that bunker
gear suits you.

00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:59.627 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but I'm still wearing
my labcoat beneath it.

00:06:59.711 --> 00:07:01.713 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
There a reason, or--?

00:07:05.133 --> 00:07:08.261 position:50% align:center
We're finally starting to
look like a real company.

00:07:08.345 --> 00:07:09.554 position:50% align:center
Yeah. We are.

00:07:09.637 --> 00:07:13.099 position:50% align:center
[IRIS, TAMAKI chuckle]

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.612 position:50% align:center
[OBI] In order to enter
the Nether legally,

00:07:25.695 --> 00:07:29.324 position:50% align:center
you have to obtain special
permission from the church.

00:07:29.407 --> 00:07:32.285 position:50% align:center
Most requests are
summarily rejected.

00:07:32.369 --> 00:07:33.745 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA]
In light of our investigation,

00:07:33.828 --> 00:07:36.039 position:50% align:center
the Temple has made a
reluctant exception,

00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:37.707 position:50% align:center
but only for Company 8.

00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:39.542 position:50% align:center
It's like they think whoever
goes down there'll

00:07:39.626 --> 00:07:42.170 position:50% align:center
be corrupted somehow.

00:07:42.253 --> 00:07:44.297 position:50% align:center
[IRIS] The Temple says
it's a tainted land,

00:07:44.381 --> 00:07:47.801 position:50% align:center
connected to hell, and
home to inhuman creatures.

00:07:47.884 --> 00:07:50.178 position:50% align:center
Nobody should go down there.

00:08:01.022 --> 00:08:04.150 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] I can't believe we used
to put our trains underground.

00:08:08.571 --> 00:08:11.199 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] So this is it?
The gate to the Nether?

00:08:11.282 --> 00:08:13.243 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
You freakin' out?

00:08:13.326 --> 00:08:16.830 position:50% align:center
So dumb. Why would I be
afraid of the Nether?

00:08:16.913 --> 00:08:19.082 position:50% align:center
Don't be ridiculous.

00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:23.044 position:50% align:center
[MAKI]
We're really going in there?

00:08:23.128 --> 00:08:24.379 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
Mama would tear me a new one

00:08:24.462 --> 00:08:26.756 position:50% align:center
if she knew I was
anywhere near here.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:29.217 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
You seem strangely calm, Vulc.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:30.051 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
Yeah.

00:08:30.135 --> 00:08:31.720 position:50% align:center
It's not my favorite place,

00:08:31.803 --> 00:08:33.221 position:50% align:center
but I've gone a few
times to check out

00:08:33.304 --> 00:08:35.098 position:50% align:center
the water treatment facilities.

00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:37.767 position:50% align:center
Again, not my favorite place.

00:08:37.851 --> 00:08:41.021 position:50% align:center
[MAKI] I don't like this. Do we
really have to go down there?

00:08:41.104 --> 00:08:44.315 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA]
Stop making such a fuss.

00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:47.444 position:50% align:center
[IRIS] Before we go, would you
mind if I offered a prayer?

00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:48.945 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Please do.

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:54.492 position:50% align:center
[IRIS] Ever do we
worship the rising Sun.

00:08:54.576 --> 00:08:55.910 position:50% align:center
We beseech thee.

00:08:55.994 --> 00:08:59.748 position:50% align:center
Grant thy light to the
souls of the innocent.

00:08:59.831 --> 00:09:01.332 position:50% align:center
<i>Látom</i> .

00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:05.253 position:50% align:center
What the hell?
Look sharp, everyone.

00:09:05.337 --> 00:09:06.504 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
It opened on its own.

00:09:06.588 --> 00:09:08.131 position:50% align:center
It must be Merlin's magic.

00:09:08.214 --> 00:09:09.841 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Don't be stupid.

00:09:09.924 --> 00:09:12.719 position:50% align:center
This an invitation
from the White-Clad?

00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:17.891 position:50% align:center
Nice. It actually opened.

00:09:17.974 --> 00:09:19.809 position:50% align:center
Looks like the electricity
still works.

00:09:19.893 --> 00:09:21.978 position:50% align:center
Wait, that was you?!
Tell us next time!

00:09:22.062 --> 00:09:23.355 position:50% align:center
Vulcan, hey,

00:09:23.438 --> 00:09:24.898 position:50% align:center
I don't guess there's another
button you could press

00:09:24.981 --> 00:09:26.483 position:50% align:center
to turn on a bunch
of lights in there.

00:09:33.448 --> 00:09:35.909 position:50% align:center
What does it look like,
Captain? See anything?

00:09:35.992 --> 00:09:37.869 position:50% align:center
[OBI yelping]

00:09:37.952 --> 00:09:39.871 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Nothing ate me.

00:09:39.954 --> 00:09:42.499 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN] Didn't realize you
were that wound up, Captain.

00:09:42.582 --> 00:09:43.917 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
Sure is dark.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.378 position:50% align:center
Well, yeah, it is the Nether.

00:09:46.461 --> 00:09:49.881 position:50% align:center
Whoa, so this is the Nether.
I can't believe I'm here.

00:09:49.964 --> 00:09:51.341 position:50% align:center
Crazy.

00:09:52.676 --> 00:09:54.511 position:50% align:center
Maki, have a light?

00:09:54.594 --> 00:09:57.639 position:50% align:center
Uh. Yes, sir. Right here.

00:09:58.723 --> 00:10:00.809 position:50% align:center
Sputter and Flare.

00:10:00.892 --> 00:10:04.062 position:50% align:center
--[SPUTTER] Sputter, sputter...
--[FLARE] Flare, flare...

00:10:04.145 --> 00:10:07.524 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA] I was hoping
for a normal light.

00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:09.943 position:50% align:center
[OBI] This is the closest
place to hell there is.

00:10:10.026 --> 00:10:11.152 position:50% align:center
Don't forget that.

00:10:11.236 --> 00:10:13.154 position:50% align:center
We'll find the base
of the Evangelist

00:10:13.238 --> 00:10:15.699 position:50% align:center
and the truth about
human combustion here.

00:10:15.782 --> 00:10:17.659 position:50% align:center
Stay sharp and keep moving.

00:10:17.742 --> 00:10:19.077 position:50% align:center
[COMPANY 8]
Yes, sir.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.538 position:50% align:center
Yona, let's shake things up.

00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:23.164 position:50% align:center
Art is meant to disrupt.

00:10:23.248 --> 00:10:26.126 position:50% align:center
And I mean to push
art to its limit.

00:10:33.383 --> 00:10:34.509 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:10:35.844 --> 00:10:37.262 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA]
Hold your positions!

00:10:37.345 --> 00:10:39.347 position:50% align:center
Everybody, stay close!

00:10:40.765 --> 00:10:43.018 position:50% align:center
Where'd you come from?

00:10:43.101 --> 00:10:43.727 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:45.311 position:50% align:center
Hey, Captain, you here?!

00:10:45.395 --> 00:10:48.231 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Shinra, help!
Something's got ahold of me.

00:10:48.314 --> 00:10:50.442 position:50% align:center
Don't let them get me, please!

00:10:50.525 --> 00:10:51.943 position:50% align:center
Hang on! I'm coming!

00:10:52.027 --> 00:10:54.738 position:50% align:center
Don't run off, Shinra!
We have to stay close!

00:10:58.533 --> 00:11:00.035 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
Iris, give me your hand.

00:11:00.118 --> 00:11:01.578 position:50% align:center
[IRIS]
Right!

00:11:01.661 --> 00:11:04.247 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKIS] At least we know
the two of us are real.

00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:07.167 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Huh?!

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:09.753 position:50% align:center
This way! Go! I found a place
where the fog's a lot thinner.

00:11:09.836 --> 00:11:11.046 position:50% align:center
Hurry up!

00:11:13.089 --> 00:11:15.925 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Huh? Huh?!

00:11:17.761 --> 00:11:21.264 position:50% align:center
[COMPANY 8 shouting]

00:11:21.348 --> 00:11:24.351 position:50% align:center
No, stop! Don't let
them split us up!

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.071 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:11:36.154 --> 00:11:37.989 position:50% align:center
[sizzling]

00:11:38.073 --> 00:11:39.240 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
Damn it.

00:11:39.324 --> 00:11:41.326 position:50% align:center
I'm only picking up two
life forms right now.

00:11:41.409 --> 00:11:44.496 position:50% align:center
Guess everyone but us
was lured or dragged away.

00:11:44.579 --> 00:11:45.747 position:50% align:center
Wait a sec.

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:48.083 position:50% align:center
How do I know if you're
the real Captain Obi?

00:11:48.166 --> 00:11:50.835 position:50% align:center
One look at those goggles
tells me you're real.

00:11:50.919 --> 00:11:53.380 position:50% align:center
Would an imposter know you
well enough to say that?

00:11:53.463 --> 00:11:54.422 position:50% align:center
Sorry, sir.

00:11:54.506 --> 00:11:56.132 position:50% align:center
I made these
life-sensing goggles

00:11:56.216 --> 00:11:58.343 position:50% align:center
to counteract Mirage's ability.

00:11:58.426 --> 00:12:00.720 position:50% align:center
Didn't occur to me that
they'd use fog along with it,

00:12:00.804 --> 00:12:03.098 position:50% align:center
as well as living imposters.

00:12:06.476 --> 00:12:08.770 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
This is a sloth snout.

00:12:08.853 --> 00:12:10.271 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Cool, bro.

00:12:12.148 --> 00:12:13.817 position:50% align:center
[WHITE-CLAD A] Thanks to
Mirage and Yona's efforts,

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:16.361 position:50% align:center
we've succeeded in
dividing the enemy.

00:12:19.489 --> 00:12:22.325 position:50% align:center
[SHO] Good. Send in the
exterminator, Assault.

00:12:22.409 --> 00:12:23.868 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:33.044 position:50% align:center
I shall go as well.

00:12:36.089 --> 00:12:37.132 position:50% align:center
[ARROW]
Then again...

00:12:37.215 --> 00:12:39.384 position:50% align:center
Assault, the Bloody
Incendiary Round,

00:12:39.467 --> 00:12:43.054 position:50% align:center
might just wipe out the
entire 8th on his own.

00:12:57.736 --> 00:12:59.487 position:50% align:center
[ALL whimper]

00:12:59.571 --> 00:13:01.781 position:50% align:center
Okay, Iris, you know I'm
the real one, don't you?!

00:13:01.865 --> 00:13:04.075 position:50% align:center
Don't listen to her!
She's lying!

00:13:06.161 --> 00:13:08.204 position:50% align:center
Why are you even struggling
to figure this out?!

00:13:08.288 --> 00:13:10.331 position:50% align:center
Any way you look at it,
that weirdo's a fake!

00:13:10.415 --> 00:13:12.959 position:50% align:center
That isn't true! She's
totally the real imposter!

00:13:13.043 --> 00:13:14.878 position:50% align:center
And she's a meanie! Hmph!

00:13:14.961 --> 00:13:16.379 position:50% align:center
One more thing that
proves I'm real--

00:13:16.463 --> 00:13:18.882 position:50% align:center
plus I was on your
left, remember?

00:13:18.965 --> 00:13:21.593 position:50% align:center
And I have flame ears!

00:13:21.676 --> 00:13:23.386 position:50% align:center
Well, I certainly
can't argue with that.

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:24.929 position:50% align:center
Totes not fair!

00:13:25.013 --> 00:13:26.890 position:50% align:center
You're trying to fool her by
doing something that I can't do!

00:13:26.973 --> 00:13:30.477 position:50% align:center
What a mean trick!
Don't make me cry!

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:38.234 position:50% align:center
This could be an incredibly
clever deception.

00:13:38.318 --> 00:13:41.654 position:50% align:center
Come on! Why are you acting
so dense about this?!

00:13:41.738 --> 00:13:43.239 position:50% align:center
She sounds like a grown-ass man!

00:13:43.323 --> 00:13:44.908 position:50% align:center
[FAKE TAMAKI]
Nuh-uh.

00:13:44.991 --> 00:13:48.328 position:50% align:center
[yelping]

00:13:48.411 --> 00:13:53.541 position:50% align:center
[screaming]

00:13:53.625 --> 00:13:56.044 position:50% align:center
[crying]

00:13:58.171 --> 00:14:00.507 position:50% align:center
[IRIS]
You are the real Tamaki!

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:03.677 position:50% align:center
Yup. Now ya know
for sure, huh?

00:14:05.095 --> 00:14:06.346 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna take out
my frustrations

00:14:06.429 --> 00:14:08.223 position:50% align:center
with Iris on you, pops.

00:14:08.306 --> 00:14:09.974 position:50% align:center
Hey, you there.

00:14:10.058 --> 00:14:11.518 position:50% align:center
[FAKE TAMAKI screaming]

00:14:11.601 --> 00:14:13.853 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI] Get back here and
take what you've got comin'!

00:14:13.937 --> 00:14:15.105 position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:14:16.648 --> 00:14:17.774 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
Hmph.

00:14:21.194 --> 00:14:22.821 position:50% align:center
[ASSAULT]
You're the first.

00:14:22.904 --> 00:14:26.241 position:50% align:center
The first on today's
long list of targets.

00:14:27.992 --> 00:14:29.160 position:50% align:center
Assault.

00:14:29.244 --> 00:14:31.913 position:50% align:center
The name of the man
who will kill you.

00:14:35.834 --> 00:14:37.961 position:50% align:center
I will not hold back.

00:14:43.675 --> 00:14:45.135 position:50% align:center
[MAKI]
Well, this bites.

00:14:45.218 --> 00:14:48.388 position:50% align:center
How did I end up all
alone down here?

00:14:48.471 --> 00:14:49.597 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:56.855 --> 00:14:58.898 position:50% align:center
[cries]

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:05.155 position:50% align:center
[whimpering]

00:15:06.364 --> 00:15:08.199 position:50% align:center
[FLAIL]
Oh. It's just a woman.

00:15:08.283 --> 00:15:09.451 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:09.534 --> 00:15:11.161 position:50% align:center
You seem a bit twitchy.

00:15:11.244 --> 00:15:13.163 position:50% align:center
What are you,
scared of the dark?

00:15:13.246 --> 00:15:16.833 position:50% align:center
That's the least of your
worries down here, little girl.

00:15:18.376 --> 00:15:19.961 position:50% align:center
[MAKI sighs]

00:15:20.045 --> 00:15:21.379 position:50% align:center
Wow, what a relief.

00:15:21.463 --> 00:15:23.298 position:50% align:center
This place is creepy
when you're alone.

00:15:23.381 --> 00:15:25.967 position:50% align:center
I'd almost convinced myself
you were ghosts.

00:15:26.051 --> 00:15:27.802 position:50% align:center
What the hell's wrong
with this girl?

00:15:27.886 --> 00:15:30.513 position:50% align:center
Has the darkness
driven her insane?

00:15:30.597 --> 00:15:32.140 position:50% align:center
Kill her.

00:15:32.223 --> 00:15:34.017 position:50% align:center
[WHITE-CLAD B]
You think this is a game?

00:15:37.645 --> 00:15:40.482 position:50% align:center
[MAKI] It's not that. I'm just
glad you're all human.

00:15:40.565 --> 00:15:43.318 position:50% align:center
It means I know how
to deal with you.

00:15:43.401 --> 00:15:44.611 position:50% align:center
Prepare to engage!

00:15:44.694 --> 00:15:46.654 position:50% align:center
Hover at 90 degrees!

00:15:48.823 --> 00:15:50.283 position:50% align:center
[MAKI]
Pressure circuits ready!

00:15:50.367 --> 00:15:52.827 position:50% align:center
Release power units!

00:15:52.911 --> 00:15:55.246 position:50% align:center
Pilots to their battle stations.

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:58.708 position:50% align:center
Good. Maintain formation!

00:15:58.792 --> 00:16:00.752 position:50% align:center
You're name's Flail, right?

00:16:00.835 --> 00:16:02.253 position:50% align:center
I'm told that you
and your friends

00:16:02.337 --> 00:16:05.965 position:50% align:center
gave one of my precious little
rookies quite the beating.

00:16:06.049 --> 00:16:09.636 position:50% align:center
Twin hover units Tekkyo
at the ready. Move out!

00:16:14.182 --> 00:16:16.976 position:50% align:center
Even through your gear,
I can see that you work out.

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:19.396 position:50% align:center
But you can't actually
expect to beat us.

00:16:19.479 --> 00:16:21.940 position:50% align:center
We're all combat professionals.

00:16:22.023 --> 00:16:25.402 position:50% align:center
Yeah? Can't say I'd've guessed
from the looks of you.

00:16:25.485 --> 00:16:27.278 position:50% align:center
[WHITE-CLAD C]
How dare you mock us!

00:16:28.613 --> 00:16:30.365 position:50% align:center
[WHITE-CLAD C]
So she's a second gen.

00:16:30.448 --> 00:16:32.742 position:50% align:center
Keep shooting! Take her down!

00:16:33.702 --> 00:16:35.620 position:50% align:center
[MAKI] Throw those little
sparks all you want.

00:16:35.704 --> 00:16:37.288 position:50% align:center
They're nothing to me!

00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:41.042 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:51.428 --> 00:16:52.804 position:50% align:center
[WHITE-CLAD C screams]

00:16:59.477 --> 00:17:00.603 position:50% align:center
[WHITE-CLAD E]
Ugh!

00:17:00.687 --> 00:17:02.105 position:50% align:center
Annoying little--

00:17:04.733 --> 00:17:06.651 position:50% align:center
[WHITE-CLAD F yells]

00:17:19.247 --> 00:17:20.623 position:50% align:center
'Kay.

00:17:25.754 --> 00:17:27.881 position:50% align:center
In the Evangelist's
hallowed name,

00:17:27.964 --> 00:17:30.508 position:50% align:center
I grant you death by fire!

00:17:34.637 --> 00:17:37.057 position:50% align:center
[FLAIL] I swing it
like a mace and chain,

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:39.309 position:50% align:center
but I'm in control.

00:17:41.061 --> 00:17:43.313 position:50% align:center
[FLAIL]
Meteor Strike!

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:51.446 position:50% align:center
Resistance is useless--
just let it crush you!

00:17:51.529 --> 00:17:52.781 position:50% align:center
--[SPUTTER] Sputter!
--[FLARE] Flare!

00:18:03.583 --> 00:18:05.752 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:18:05.835 --> 00:18:07.337 position:50% align:center
[FLAIL]
I don't care how brawny you are,

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:08.922 position:50% align:center
you're still just a woman!

00:18:09.005 --> 00:18:11.633 position:50% align:center
You can't hurt me!

00:18:11.716 --> 00:18:16.262 position:50% align:center
Who are you calling...
gorilla cyclops?!

00:18:20.642 --> 00:18:22.936 position:50% align:center
[MAKI] I better hurry
and find the others.

00:18:27.649 --> 00:18:29.734 position:50% align:center
Iris, stay back.

00:18:29.818 --> 00:18:30.860 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:18:35.365 --> 00:18:38.368 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
He's a third gen, too.

00:18:38.451 --> 00:18:40.620 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:18:43.748 --> 00:18:46.376 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI coughing]

00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:53.758 position:50% align:center
Ah. You have decent fire
resistance, if nothing else.

00:18:53.842 --> 00:18:55.135 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI screams]

00:18:56.261 --> 00:18:57.512 position:50% align:center
Are you okay, Tamaki?

00:18:57.595 --> 00:18:59.055 position:50% align:center
I'm fine! Get back!

00:18:59.139 --> 00:19:03.143 position:50% align:center
Forgive me, but I have
others to deal with.

00:19:03.226 --> 00:19:05.228 position:50% align:center
Besides, enemies or not,

00:19:05.311 --> 00:19:10.066 position:50% align:center
I find it distasteful to inflict
needless suffering on women.

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:12.819 position:50% align:center
So I'll make your deaths quick.

00:19:17.323 --> 00:19:19.367 position:50% align:center
Are you sure you wanna do this?

00:19:19.451 --> 00:19:21.911 position:50% align:center
It'll be dangerous, and
you're with Company 1.

00:19:21.995 --> 00:19:23.872 position:50% align:center
We'd understand
if you bowed out.

00:19:23.955 --> 00:19:25.832 position:50% align:center
Even if it's just because
of my suspension,

00:19:25.915 --> 00:19:28.501 position:50% align:center
for the time being,
I'm a member of the 8th.

00:19:28.585 --> 00:19:31.212 position:50% align:center
Which means I join
you on your missions.

00:19:38.053 --> 00:19:42.307 position:50% align:center
Hey, Tamaki. I hear you're
coming with us to the Nether.

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:43.767 position:50% align:center
If you end up
needing to be saved,

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:46.186 position:50% align:center
call for me and I'll come.

00:19:46.269 --> 00:19:48.271 position:50% align:center
Don't forget I'm a
Fire Soldier, too.

00:19:48.355 --> 00:19:52.984 position:50% align:center
My job is to protect people,
not be your dumb damsel.

00:19:53.068 --> 00:19:55.236 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Oh, yeah,
you are a Fire Soldier.

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:56.988 position:50% align:center
I almost forgot.

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:02.369 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:20:02.452 --> 00:20:05.246 position:50% align:center
They gave me this
uniform for a reason!

00:20:08.375 --> 00:20:10.126 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
I can do this.

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:16.424 position:50% align:center
Don't be scared, Iris.
I'll protect you!

00:20:16.508 --> 00:20:19.260 position:50% align:center
I am the assassin
from the abyss.

00:20:19.344 --> 00:20:21.513 position:50% align:center
And you're in my grasp.

00:20:23.973 --> 00:20:25.433 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:20:29.896 --> 00:20:34.818 position:50% align:center
