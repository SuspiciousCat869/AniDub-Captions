00:00:27.277 --> 00:00:29.654 position:50% align:center
[IRIS] Raffles saw at once
that the unsullied flame

00:00:29.738 --> 00:00:31.614 position:50% align:center
was a gift from the great Sol.

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:34.117 position:50% align:center
He resolved to harness its
power with technology

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.579 position:50% align:center
and created Amaterasu.

00:00:37.662 --> 00:00:40.457 position:50% align:center
By the light of
Amaterasu's sacred flame,

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.542 position:50% align:center
the people began to rebuild.

00:00:42.625 --> 00:00:46.963 position:50% align:center
With its power, they established
a new state in the Far East.

00:01:10.195 --> 00:01:11.988 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN] Good to be back
on your feet again?

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:12.947 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:01:13.031 --> 00:01:14.199 position:50% align:center
I've missed havin' you around

00:01:14.282 --> 00:01:16.576 position:50% align:center
to keep our self-proclaimed
knight in check.

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:18.119 position:50% align:center
The guy's somethin' else.

00:01:18.203 --> 00:01:19.496 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:20.997 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN] There were some
old reports lying around,

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:24.250 position:50% align:center
and he got the bright idea
to shred 'em usin' Excalibur.

00:01:24.334 --> 00:01:25.126 position:50% align:center
Nuts, right?

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.753 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:01:28.129 --> 00:01:31.049 position:50% align:center
Try sayin' somethin'
besides "yeah," ya Devil.

00:01:31.132 --> 00:01:32.467 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Okay.

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:38.473 position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:01:38.556 --> 00:01:39.808 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Hm?

00:01:39.891 --> 00:01:42.143 position:50% align:center
When you talk to Maki
and Sister Iris,

00:01:42.227 --> 00:01:45.063 position:50% align:center
try to brighten up a little.

00:01:45.146 --> 00:01:47.399 position:50% align:center
They've both been
worried sick about you.

00:01:47.482 --> 00:01:50.652 position:50% align:center
I know you've got a lot
on your mind right now,

00:01:50.735 --> 00:01:53.697 position:50% align:center
but you aren't alone in this.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.115 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:01:55.198 --> 00:01:58.660 position:50% align:center
Plus, that tiny brain of yours
can only brood so much.

00:01:58.743 --> 00:01:59.577 position:50% align:center
You'll break it.

00:01:59.661 --> 00:02:00.995 position:50% align:center
Shut up, jerk.

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.914 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
Fair warning: Tamaki's there.

00:02:02.997 --> 00:02:06.584 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Great. Toss in
the crazy cat girl, too.

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:12.799 position:50% align:center
[IRIS humming]

00:02:12.882 --> 00:02:14.009 position:50% align:center
[IRIS]
Hm?

00:02:27.647 --> 00:02:28.773 position:50% align:center
Welcome back.

00:02:28.857 --> 00:02:30.525 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad you're okay.

00:02:30.608 --> 00:02:33.069 position:50% align:center
Sorry if I worried you, Sister!

00:02:34.487 --> 00:02:36.239 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
So, how's everyone been?

00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:39.659 position:50% align:center
Well, they'll all be
excited to see you.

00:02:43.872 --> 00:02:45.290 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Shinra!

00:02:45.373 --> 00:02:47.042 position:50% align:center
Congrats on getting outta there.

00:02:47.125 --> 00:02:49.085 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry I didn't get
a chance to visit.

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:50.962 position:50% align:center
I have been thinking
about you, though.

00:02:51.046 --> 00:02:52.255 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
No, it's fine.

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:54.924 position:50% align:center
You had to stand by
in case of a callout.

00:02:56.217 --> 00:02:57.385 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
Hmph!

00:03:00.388 --> 00:03:02.932 position:50% align:center
Hey, there. Welcome back.

00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:05.435 position:50% align:center
Super glad to see the Adolla
Burst is safe and sound.

00:03:05.518 --> 00:03:07.479 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI] What's it gonna
take to kill this guy?

00:03:07.562 --> 00:03:09.397 position:50% align:center
It's like he's got nine lives.

00:03:13.068 --> 00:03:14.903 position:50% align:center
Well, look at you.

00:03:14.986 --> 00:03:17.614 position:50% align:center
No big surprise that
Heaven rejected a devil.

00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:18.990 position:50% align:center
So you're still here?

00:03:19.074 --> 00:03:20.158 position:50% align:center
They haven't gotten
sick of having

00:03:20.241 --> 00:03:22.327 position:50% align:center
a brainless knight around yet?

00:03:24.954 --> 00:03:27.040 position:50% align:center
Oh, good, you're back. I'm glad.

00:03:27.123 --> 00:03:28.458 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir.

00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:30.543 position:50% align:center
I'd like you to start
compiling the incident reports

00:03:30.627 --> 00:03:32.712 position:50% align:center
on the Nether as
soon as possible,

00:03:32.796 --> 00:03:35.548 position:50% align:center
but your debrief with
the captain takes priority.

00:03:37.801 --> 00:03:41.179 position:50% align:center
[OBI] So you busted
outta there. 'Bout time.

00:03:41.262 --> 00:03:45.266 position:50% align:center
Thank you, sir.
Shinra Kusakabe, reporting in.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.060 position:50% align:center
I'm ready for duty.

00:04:12.711 --> 00:04:14.671 position:50% align:center
<i>take what you got and leave now</i>

00:04:14.754 --> 00:04:16.840 position:50% align:center
<i>you're wearing out your welcome</i>

00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:20.593 position:50% align:center
<i>no one here wants</i>
<i>to see you, hear you</i>

00:04:20.677 --> 00:04:22.637 position:50% align:center
<i>think that you won from day one</i>

00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:24.764 position:50% align:center
<i>but soon the devil will come</i>

00:04:24.848 --> 00:04:28.476 position:50% align:center
<i>you know just why</i>
<i>he wants you, don't you?</i>

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.522 position:50% align:center
<i>you're crooked desire</i>
<i>left us in disarray</i>

00:04:32.605 --> 00:04:36.484 position:50% align:center
<i>misguided, divided</i>
<i>at the point of no return</i>

00:04:36.568 --> 00:04:40.572 position:50% align:center
<i>you started a fire,</i>
<i>you're gonna watch it burn</i>

00:04:40.655 --> 00:04:44.200 position:50% align:center
<i>try to save yourself</i>
<i>like you always do</i>

00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:46.953 position:50% align:center
<i>every bridge we build</i>

00:04:47.037 --> 00:04:51.833 position:50% align:center
<i>you think it's yours to burn</i>
<i>it down just burn it down</i>

00:04:51.916 --> 00:04:54.753 position:50% align:center

00:04:54.836 --> 00:04:59.174 position:50% align:center

00:04:59.257 --> 00:05:03.887 position:50% align:center

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.932 position:50% align:center
<i>MAYDAY</i>

00:05:08.016 --> 00:05:11.936 position:50% align:center
<i>MAYDAY</i>

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.648 position:50% align:center
<i>MAYDAY</i>

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:23.156 position:50% align:center
So how's the 6th?
Things going well?

00:05:23.239 --> 00:05:25.158 position:50% align:center
Oh, we're doing just fine, sir.

00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:27.577 position:50% align:center
We have Captain
Huang, after all.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.538 position:50% align:center
Things are pretty
quiet arou-- Uh!

00:05:30.622 --> 00:05:32.248 position:50% align:center
What's going on?!

00:05:36.336 --> 00:05:39.255 position:50% align:center
So, these're the feet that
move faster than light

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:41.341 position:50% align:center
when blessed with grace.

00:05:47.722 --> 00:05:48.890 position:50% align:center
Kusakabe!

00:05:48.973 --> 00:05:51.059 position:50% align:center
You're supposed to be on
bed rest--no exceptions!

00:05:51.142 --> 00:05:53.687 position:50% align:center
Now go and lie down
this instant!

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.939 position:50% align:center
We might as well
let them finish.

00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:58.274 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid there's no
stopping this now.

00:05:58.358 --> 00:06:02.404 position:50% align:center
Burns is a hard-head, always
has been and always will be.

00:06:02.487 --> 00:06:06.157 position:50% align:center
This is the only kind of
communication he understands.

00:06:06.241 --> 00:06:08.827 position:50% align:center
Seeing the young man's growth
has lit a spark in him.

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:12.706 position:50% align:center
The captain's blood
is set to boil now.

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:14.666 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
You hid the truth!

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.088 position:50% align:center
Nothing you can say
can justify that.

00:06:20.171 --> 00:06:22.340 position:50% align:center
[BURNS] Fire Soldiers work
for the greater good.

00:06:22.424 --> 00:06:25.260 position:50% align:center
If a lie can save
a life, so be it.

00:06:27.137 --> 00:06:28.805 position:50% align:center
Better stand back.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.143 position:50% align:center
I think he's getting
warmed up now.

00:06:34.436 --> 00:06:35.520 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.865 position:50% align:center
The heat coming off him
feels like it could crush me.

00:06:46.948 --> 00:06:48.533 position:50% align:center
He's like a human furnace.

00:06:48.616 --> 00:06:49.743 position:50% align:center
He stokes his inner flame

00:06:49.826 --> 00:06:52.120 position:50% align:center
and circulates its heat
throughout his body

00:06:52.203 --> 00:06:55.498 position:50% align:center
so that every muscle burns
with tremendous power.

00:06:55.582 --> 00:06:58.168 position:50% align:center
Captain Burns is now a roiling
mass of thermal energy

00:06:58.251 --> 00:06:59.419 position:50% align:center
in this state.

00:06:59.502 --> 00:07:03.006 position:50% align:center
It's easy to see him as
flame given human form.

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:05.592 position:50% align:center
I couldn't afford to
tell you the truth.

00:07:05.675 --> 00:07:08.928 position:50% align:center
Knowledge can be dangerous,
and often deadly to the weak.

00:07:09.012 --> 00:07:10.096 position:50% align:center
If you want answers,

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:11.890 position:50% align:center
prove you're strong
enough to hear 'em.

00:07:11.973 --> 00:07:13.641 position:50% align:center
Convince me you're ready.

00:07:13.725 --> 00:07:14.809 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:07:14.893 --> 00:07:16.102 position:50% align:center
You're the one who showed up

00:07:16.186 --> 00:07:17.562 position:50% align:center
saying you wanted to
"have a chat" about this,

00:07:17.645 --> 00:07:19.314 position:50% align:center
so why're you making
it difficult now?

00:07:19.397 --> 00:07:21.232 position:50% align:center
Tell me what you said you would!

00:07:21.316 --> 00:07:23.610 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?
Scared you won't impress?

00:07:23.693 --> 00:07:26.488 position:50% align:center
Shut up! You lying f--

00:07:26.571 --> 00:07:29.157 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.409 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Faker!

00:07:31.493 --> 00:07:34.329 position:50% align:center
[ONYANGO] Think he was about to
call the captain a naughty word.

00:07:34.412 --> 00:07:37.123 position:50% align:center
[ASAKO] It took everything
he had to hold back.

00:07:40.543 --> 00:07:43.254 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Okay. You got it.

00:07:43.338 --> 00:07:44.881 position:50% align:center
I'll show you for a fact.

00:07:44.964 --> 00:07:48.385 position:50% align:center
I'm nowhere near as fragile
as you think I am, sir.

00:08:05.193 --> 00:08:07.362 position:50% align:center
[BURNS]
This is all I could save?

00:08:07.445 --> 00:08:10.031 position:50% align:center
One small, helpless life?

00:08:10.115 --> 00:08:12.867 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna find it.
I'm gonna destroy it.

00:08:12.951 --> 00:08:16.246 position:50% align:center
The monster's gonna pay
for this. I'll kill it.

00:08:20.458 --> 00:08:21.918 position:50% align:center
[BURNS]
You've grown so strong.

00:08:22.002 --> 00:08:23.378 position:50% align:center
I can hardly believe it.

00:08:23.461 --> 00:08:25.880 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna make you talk
if it kills me.

00:08:25.964 --> 00:08:27.882 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:08:29.092 --> 00:08:31.344 position:50% align:center
[BURNS] Is that all
the resolve you have?

00:08:31.428 --> 00:08:34.723 position:50% align:center
It's like the sputtering
flame of a candle.

00:08:34.806 --> 00:08:37.142 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Don't take me so lightly.

00:08:37.225 --> 00:08:39.811 position:50% align:center
Or you'll be in for
an ugly surprise!

00:08:43.773 --> 00:08:48.194 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:08:55.035 --> 00:08:57.245 position:50% align:center
[BURNS] Are you sure you
won't regret finding out?

00:08:57.328 --> 00:09:00.498 position:50% align:center
I hate fire more than anything,
but I joined the Fire Force.

00:09:00.582 --> 00:09:03.376 position:50% align:center
All because I needed
to find the truth!

00:09:14.721 --> 00:09:17.682 position:50% align:center
[BURNS] That tiny,
sputtering flame you had...

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:22.145 position:50% align:center
...has now grown into
a raging inferno.

00:09:22.228 --> 00:09:24.064 position:50% align:center
It's been a long time.

00:09:24.147 --> 00:09:29.235 position:50% align:center
My arm stings where you hit me.
That's proof of your strength.

00:09:31.196 --> 00:09:32.405 position:50% align:center
[BURNS]
And what's more,

00:09:32.489 --> 00:09:34.783 position:50% align:center
you have the resolve
to see this through.

00:09:34.866 --> 00:09:36.534 position:50% align:center
I'll tell you everything.

00:09:36.618 --> 00:09:38.620 position:50% align:center
First off, as you've
no doubt guessed,

00:09:38.703 --> 00:09:41.748 position:50% align:center
most of what you know
about that fire is wrong.

00:09:41.831 --> 00:09:43.875 position:50% align:center
The servants of the
Evangelist have been at work

00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.960 position:50% align:center
for quite some time now.

00:09:46.044 --> 00:09:48.213 position:50% align:center
At least 12 years.

00:09:57.889 --> 00:09:59.432 position:50% align:center
Tell me if you sense anything.

00:09:59.516 --> 00:10:02.769 position:50% align:center
The Evangelist did say
this was the place, correct?

00:10:02.852 --> 00:10:03.895 position:50% align:center
Right around here

00:10:03.978 --> 00:10:06.439 position:50% align:center
a new Adolla Burst
will soon be born.

00:10:06.523 --> 00:10:10.318 position:50% align:center
[HAUMEA giggling]

00:10:10.402 --> 00:10:12.153 position:50% align:center
Oh, hell yeah.

00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:15.949 position:50% align:center
[BURNS] The White-Clad
knew about that fire

00:10:16.032 --> 00:10:18.493 position:50% align:center
well before the first
spark even flew.

00:10:18.576 --> 00:10:22.789 position:50% align:center
They knew? Does that mean
they're the ones who--?

00:10:22.872 --> 00:10:25.417 position:50% align:center
[BURNS] The cause of that
fire was perfectly clear.

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:26.918 position:50% align:center
And it wasn't you.

00:10:27.002 --> 00:10:30.380 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] I know that! There
was a Demon Infernal there!

00:10:32.716 --> 00:10:35.885 position:50% align:center
We're happy to have
you, Number Three.

00:10:39.556 --> 00:10:41.474 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:41.558 --> 00:10:42.726 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA'S MOTHER]
Sho!

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:45.603 position:50% align:center
No. I--

00:10:45.687 --> 00:10:47.605 position:50% align:center
Shinra! Don't look, honey.

00:10:47.689 --> 00:10:50.358 position:50% align:center
You need to run away! Hurry!

00:10:53.653 --> 00:10:58.616 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA'S MOTHER] You have to...
get out of here, Shinra.

00:11:03.121 --> 00:11:07.459 position:50% align:center
[roars]

00:11:07.542 --> 00:11:09.252 position:50% align:center
A demon.

00:11:11.004 --> 00:11:12.881 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA yells]

00:11:19.471 --> 00:11:22.265 position:50% align:center
Come out, Sho!
Where are you?

00:11:22.349 --> 00:11:24.059 position:50% align:center
[BURNS]
The source of the fire

00:11:24.142 --> 00:11:27.562 position:50% align:center
that changed your
life 12 years ago...

00:11:27.645 --> 00:11:31.066 position:50% align:center
...was your little brother, Sho.

00:11:31.149 --> 00:11:34.152 position:50% align:center
Baby, come on!

00:11:34.235 --> 00:11:36.821 position:50% align:center
[BURNS] It was because
of Sho's Adolla Burst

00:11:36.905 --> 00:11:40.075 position:50% align:center
that your third-generation
abilities were awakened.

00:11:49.209 --> 00:11:53.880 position:50% align:center
[screaming]

00:11:53.963 --> 00:11:55.048 position:50% align:center
[CHARON]
You understand the reason

00:11:55.131 --> 00:11:57.092 position:50% align:center
we keep our eyes covered, right?

00:11:57.175 --> 00:11:59.094 position:50% align:center
[HAUMEA]
Of course I do.

00:11:59.177 --> 00:12:01.262 position:50% align:center
Because if we tried to
look at the sun directly,

00:12:01.346 --> 00:12:03.056 position:50% align:center
it would burn our eyes.

00:12:03.139 --> 00:12:06.935 position:50% align:center
Although the sun shine's bright,
we mortals may not see it.

00:12:07.018 --> 00:12:09.020 position:50% align:center
Those who would
approach the celestial

00:12:09.104 --> 00:12:11.314 position:50% align:center
must feel it in their hearts.

00:12:12.273 --> 00:12:18.279 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA'S MOTHER groaning]

00:12:28.623 --> 00:12:30.208 position:50% align:center
[BURNS]
The horned Infernal.

00:12:30.291 --> 00:12:33.253 position:50% align:center
The demon you saw in your home.

00:12:33.336 --> 00:12:35.005 position:50% align:center
Was my mom?

00:12:39.384 --> 00:12:42.554 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
No. That can't be right.

00:12:42.637 --> 00:12:44.973 position:50% align:center
Everything I've done
since that day

00:12:45.056 --> 00:12:48.643 position:50% align:center
was to find that
Infernal and kill it.

00:12:50.478 --> 00:12:55.358 position:50% align:center
[SHO cooing]

00:13:03.366 --> 00:13:05.285 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
So Sho caused the fire,

00:13:05.368 --> 00:13:07.954 position:50% align:center
and the Demon Infernal
that I was to blame...

00:13:08.038 --> 00:13:09.664 position:50% align:center
...was my mom.

00:13:09.748 --> 00:13:12.292 position:50% align:center
But if Mom turned,
where did she go?

00:13:12.375 --> 00:13:13.960 position:50% align:center
What happened to her?

00:13:14.044 --> 00:13:16.546 position:50% align:center
The flames had raged
for 15 minutes

00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:19.132 position:50% align:center
by the time I arrived
at the scene.

00:13:20.383 --> 00:13:21.843 position:50% align:center
Anyone alive in there?!

00:13:21.926 --> 00:13:23.845 position:50% align:center
Why aren't we trying
to put out the flames?

00:13:23.928 --> 00:13:26.389 position:50% align:center
[ONYANGO] We did,
but this fire isn't normal.

00:13:26.473 --> 00:13:28.725 position:50% align:center
Water doesn't even slow it down.

00:13:31.519 --> 00:13:34.022 position:50% align:center
[BURNS] You fight that fire
till the hoses run dry,

00:13:34.105 --> 00:13:35.774 position:50% align:center
and after that, start spitting!

00:13:35.857 --> 00:13:37.859 position:50% align:center
Those of you with powers
are coming with me.

00:13:37.942 --> 00:13:41.196 position:50% align:center
We'll charge straight in
and pull out any survivors.

00:13:47.118 --> 00:13:49.162 position:50% align:center
Three, two, one!

00:13:53.458 --> 00:13:54.501 position:50% align:center
I think he's alive!

00:13:54.584 --> 00:13:56.336 position:50% align:center
We need a paramedic up here now!

00:13:56.419 --> 00:13:57.671 position:50% align:center
[1ST CREWMAN B]
Sir!

00:13:57.754 --> 00:13:58.630 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:58.713 --> 00:14:00.215 position:50% align:center
Let go of me.

00:14:00.298 --> 00:14:02.175 position:50% align:center
My mom and little brother are
still trapped inside the house,

00:14:02.258 --> 00:14:03.635 position:50% align:center
and there's a demon
in there with them.

00:14:03.718 --> 00:14:04.511 position:50% align:center
I have to stop it...

00:14:04.594 --> 00:14:06.638 position:50% align:center
So what do you think?

00:14:06.721 --> 00:14:08.682 position:50% align:center
[BURNS]
A fire that won't go out.

00:14:08.765 --> 00:14:09.808 position:50% align:center
A demon.

00:14:09.891 --> 00:14:11.768 position:50% align:center
Things don't get much worse.

00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:14.229 position:50% align:center
I'm going in there.

00:14:14.312 --> 00:14:16.439 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:14:16.523 --> 00:14:19.401 position:50% align:center
I put the corpse in place
to stand in for the mother.

00:14:19.484 --> 00:14:23.154 position:50% align:center
Speaking of, tell me,
are you in control?

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:30.245 position:50% align:center
Hey, Haumea. How goes it?
Talk to me. Did it work or not?

00:14:30.328 --> 00:14:34.666 position:50% align:center
Hey. Haumea. Say something.

00:14:34.749 --> 00:14:37.460 position:50% align:center
I'm doing it, so shut
your stupid trap, Charon!

00:14:37.544 --> 00:14:40.922 position:50% align:center
If you can't help but distract
me, then get lost and die.

00:14:41.006 --> 00:14:42.799 position:50% align:center
Why didn't you just
answer the first time?

00:14:42.882 --> 00:14:44.009 position:50% align:center
[HAUMEA]
Why should I have?

00:14:44.092 --> 00:14:45.593 position:50% align:center
Would you have
helped me if I had?

00:14:45.677 --> 00:14:47.262 position:50% align:center
Of course not. You can't.

00:14:47.345 --> 00:14:51.141 position:50% align:center
So shut your ugly, useless
face and stop bothering me!

00:14:51.224 --> 00:14:52.517 position:50% align:center
[CHARON]
Okay, yeah.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.644 position:50% align:center
My bad. My bad.

00:14:54.728 --> 00:14:58.815 position:50% align:center
[snickering]

00:14:58.898 --> 00:15:00.567 position:50% align:center
She's scary.

00:15:03.903 --> 00:15:07.449 position:50% align:center
If someone was in here,
by now, they'd be--

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:18.043 position:50% align:center
[BURNS]
That demon has a baby.

00:15:21.171 --> 00:15:22.297 position:50% align:center
Get over here,

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:24.382 position:50% align:center
and bring your precious
baby with you, 'kay?

00:15:24.466 --> 00:15:25.592 position:50% align:center
[BURNS]
Hold it!

00:15:26.718 --> 00:15:28.345 position:50% align:center
The whole place'll
come down soon.

00:15:28.428 --> 00:15:29.262 position:50% align:center
Get outta there!

00:15:29.346 --> 00:15:30.930 position:50% align:center
[BURNS]
That Infernal just--!

00:15:32.974 --> 00:15:33.975 position:50% align:center
[ONYANGO]
Hurry!

00:15:34.059 --> 00:15:36.144 position:50% align:center
[1ST CREWMAN A]
Watch your head!

00:15:36.227 --> 00:15:38.021 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:15:44.778 --> 00:15:45.987 position:50% align:center
[HAUMEA]
Hm?

00:15:51.659 --> 00:15:53.370 position:50% align:center
[HAUMEA]
Huh...?

00:15:56.956 --> 00:15:58.541 position:50% align:center
[BURNS]
A Demon Infernal.

00:15:58.625 --> 00:16:00.293 position:50% align:center
An Adolla Burst.

00:16:00.377 --> 00:16:02.170 position:50% align:center
An Adolla Link.

00:16:02.253 --> 00:16:05.048 position:50% align:center
The old wound's burning
out of control.

00:16:05.131 --> 00:16:07.217 position:50% align:center
Like when I saw the
other world's flame

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:09.344 position:50% align:center
and lost my eye to it.

00:16:09.427 --> 00:16:11.137 position:50% align:center
Mom! Sho! Come out!

00:16:11.221 --> 00:16:13.598 position:50% align:center
[1ST CREWMAN B] I'm sorry,
but I can't let you go.

00:16:13.682 --> 00:16:16.226 position:50% align:center
[BURNS] Surprised they
didn't take him, too.

00:16:16.309 --> 00:16:18.728 position:50% align:center
His abilities have
been awakened,

00:16:18.812 --> 00:16:21.314 position:50% align:center
but his flames are still weak.

00:16:21.398 --> 00:16:22.524 position:50% align:center
Think you can--?

00:16:22.607 --> 00:16:23.900 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:16:28.405 --> 00:16:29.239 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA grunting]

00:16:29.322 --> 00:16:30.990 position:50% align:center
[BURNS]
Listen closely.

00:16:32.492 --> 00:16:35.120 position:50% align:center
Your mother was killed
in that fire.

00:16:37.163 --> 00:16:39.666 position:50% align:center
[BURNS]
Your brother met the same fate.

00:16:46.548 --> 00:16:47.590 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Why?

00:16:47.674 --> 00:16:49.676 position:50% align:center
Why did you lie to me?

00:16:49.759 --> 00:16:52.429 position:50% align:center
[BURNS] To keep you from getting
involved in this mess.

00:16:52.512 --> 00:16:53.972 position:50% align:center
If they found out
about your powers,

00:16:54.055 --> 00:16:56.141 position:50% align:center
they'd've come for you, too.

00:16:56.224 --> 00:16:58.518 position:50% align:center
I lied because I wanted
the fear of the flames

00:16:58.601 --> 00:17:00.145 position:50% align:center
to be strong in you.

00:17:00.228 --> 00:17:02.105 position:50% align:center
I wanted you to
hate fire so much

00:17:02.188 --> 00:17:04.983 position:50% align:center
that you'd never think
of using your powers,

00:17:05.066 --> 00:17:08.278 position:50% align:center
and no one would ever
find out you had them.

00:17:08.361 --> 00:17:10.989 position:50% align:center
Well, I do hate fire, even now.

00:17:11.072 --> 00:17:12.907 position:50% align:center
Even knowing that you lied.

00:17:12.991 --> 00:17:16.536 position:50% align:center
Whatever caused that
fire 12 years ago,

00:17:16.619 --> 00:17:19.080 position:50% align:center
flames are what took my
family away from me,

00:17:19.164 --> 00:17:21.916 position:50% align:center
and for that,
I'll always hate them.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.002 position:50% align:center
That said, it's by using them

00:17:24.085 --> 00:17:26.713 position:50% align:center
that you've made it
as far as you have.

00:17:30.508 --> 00:17:33.303 position:50% align:center
I said what I came to say,
so I'll take my leave now.

00:17:33.386 --> 00:17:34.971 position:50% align:center
Wait a sec, please.

00:17:36.306 --> 00:17:39.351 position:50% align:center
I've got one more question.
Have you had an Adolla Link?

00:17:39.434 --> 00:17:41.478 position:50% align:center
Have you looked at
Hell for yourself?

00:17:41.561 --> 00:17:42.896 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:17:42.979 --> 00:17:46.566 position:50% align:center
It cost me an eye, but I've
seen the flames of Hell.

00:17:46.649 --> 00:17:48.485 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
The demon from 12 years ago,

00:17:48.568 --> 00:17:51.905 position:50% align:center
was it an Infernal with horns
where its eyes should've been?

00:17:51.988 --> 00:17:53.365 position:50% align:center
[BURNS]
It was.

00:17:53.448 --> 00:17:56.576 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Then back at
the Nether, that was her.

00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:02.499 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Where'd my mom go? Did you see?

00:18:02.582 --> 00:18:05.627 position:50% align:center
I only ever got
that one glimpse.

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:12.592 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
If I make another Adolla Link,

00:18:12.676 --> 00:18:16.179 position:50% align:center
then maybe I can see
that Infernal again.

00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:18.431 position:50% align:center
I could see Mom again.

00:18:18.515 --> 00:18:21.643 position:50% align:center
But how do I make another Link?

00:18:22.977 --> 00:18:26.523 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] That captain,
I saw him in Adolla.

00:18:26.606 --> 00:18:30.110 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, but... I have to
insist you get more rest.

00:18:30.193 --> 00:18:31.361 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:38.368 position:50% align:center
--You look like him!
--Wait, who do I look like?

00:18:38.451 --> 00:18:39.619 position:50% align:center
Sounded like you said "him."

00:18:39.703 --> 00:18:42.372 position:50% align:center
Well, uh, you're
Lieutenant Hague, right?

00:18:42.455 --> 00:18:43.790 position:50% align:center
Yes?

00:18:43.873 --> 00:18:46.751 position:50% align:center
Well, then, I have to ask.
Company 4, their captain.

00:18:46.835 --> 00:18:48.837 position:50% align:center
Oh. Yeah.

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:51.923 position:50% align:center
Captain Soichiro Hague of
the 4th is my grandfather.

00:18:52.007 --> 00:18:53.842 position:50% align:center
As you've apparently guessed.

00:18:53.925 --> 00:18:56.011 position:50% align:center
Uh, why though?

00:18:56.094 --> 00:18:57.721 position:50% align:center
Do you really think
I look like him?

00:18:57.804 --> 00:18:59.139 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
No! Not really.

00:18:59.222 --> 00:19:01.558 position:50% align:center
You just share a couple distinct
but very minor features.

00:19:01.641 --> 00:19:02.392 position:50% align:center
No need to worry.

00:19:02.475 --> 00:19:04.185 position:50% align:center
Why would I worry?

00:19:06.354 --> 00:19:07.689 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Anyway,

00:19:07.772 --> 00:19:10.316 position:50% align:center
would you be willing to
introduce me to Captain Hague?

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:13.111 position:50% align:center
You're asking to meet
my grandfather?

00:19:17.532 --> 00:19:19.075 position:50% align:center
That's my full report.

00:19:19.159 --> 00:19:20.744 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:19:20.827 --> 00:19:23.038 position:50% align:center
[OBI] So your banking on the
theory that Captain Hague

00:19:23.121 --> 00:19:25.915 position:50% align:center
and the Adolla Link
are connected somehow.

00:19:25.999 --> 00:19:27.125 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
That's correct, sir.

00:19:27.208 --> 00:19:29.169 position:50% align:center
I recently met a
relative of his,

00:19:29.252 --> 00:19:31.463 position:50% align:center
Lieutenant Asako
Hague of the 6th.

00:19:31.546 --> 00:19:33.214 position:50% align:center
I asked her to introduce us.

00:19:33.298 --> 00:19:34.424 position:50% align:center
Could work.

00:19:34.507 --> 00:19:36.134 position:50% align:center
I was actually just
about to get in touch

00:19:36.217 --> 00:19:39.095 position:50% align:center
with the chief of the
Fire Defense Agency.

00:19:39.179 --> 00:19:42.432 position:50% align:center
I'll see if he can reach out
to Company 4 on our behalf.

00:19:42.515 --> 00:19:45.435 position:50% align:center
But if we assume the
story Captain Burns

00:19:45.518 --> 00:19:47.771 position:50% align:center
told you is actually legit,

00:19:47.854 --> 00:19:50.106 position:50% align:center
then the White-Clad were
at the very least involved

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:52.734 position:50% align:center
in the tragedy that took
your family from you.

00:19:52.817 --> 00:19:55.653 position:50% align:center
I lived for the chance to
get revenge on that demon.

00:19:55.737 --> 00:19:57.614 position:50% align:center
After 12 years,
it hurts to think

00:19:57.697 --> 00:19:59.282 position:50% align:center
that it might've been my mother.

00:19:59.366 --> 00:20:01.034 position:50% align:center
But I was wrong about
my brother's death,

00:20:01.117 --> 00:20:03.453 position:50% align:center
so I can't rule this out either.

00:20:03.536 --> 00:20:07.207 position:50% align:center
Tell me this, if your mother
has become an Infernal,

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:10.502 position:50% align:center
and it turns out
she's still around...

00:20:10.585 --> 00:20:11.920 position:50% align:center
Then I'll save her.

00:20:12.003 --> 00:20:15.090 position:50% align:center
I'll find a way to turn her
back into a human being.

00:21:52.103 --> 00:21:53.521 position:50% align:center
What a dump.

00:22:00.612 --> 00:22:03.490 position:50% align:center
I'm okay. I'm okay.

00:22:07.243 --> 00:22:08.870 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:22:08.953 --> 00:22:10.246 position:50% align:center
Don't feel bad.

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:11.831 position:50% align:center
I'm a knight, a swordsman,

00:22:11.915 --> 00:22:14.000 position:50% align:center
so it makes sense I'm better
at wielding a blade.

00:22:14.084 --> 00:22:16.211 position:50% align:center
I'll pretend that this
next onion's your head.

00:22:16.294 --> 00:22:17.295 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR, SHINRA]
I can definitely cut this

00:22:17.379 --> 00:22:18.880 position:50% align:center
faster than him!

00:22:20.382 --> 00:22:23.218 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA]
Take it easy, you two.

00:22:23.301 --> 00:22:24.344 position:50% align:center
--[SHINRA] Hey!
--[ARTHUR] What?

00:22:24.427 --> 00:22:26.429 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
Oh. Knight King.

00:22:27.847 --> 00:22:28.556 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA grunts]

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:30.058 position:50% align:center
[KARIM grumbles]

00:22:30.141 --> 00:22:31.476 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA grunts]

00:22:35.355 --> 00:22:36.856 position:50% align:center
[KARIM]
<i>Látom.</i>

00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:38.274 position:50% align:center
Uh, <i>Látom</i> .

00:22:38.358 --> 00:22:41.653 position:50% align:center
I thoroughly enjoy it when
gravel learns its place.

00:22:41.736 --> 00:22:43.113 position:50% align:center
Hello, Lieutenant Karim!

00:22:43.196 --> 00:22:45.198 position:50% align:center
Uh? Oh, Tamaki.

00:22:45.281 --> 00:22:48.118 position:50% align:center
Good to see you're here
havin' a good time here.

00:22:48.201 --> 00:22:51.037 position:50% align:center
Yeah, uh, listen.

00:22:51.121 --> 00:22:52.706 position:50% align:center
Could you...?

00:22:52.789 --> 00:22:54.874 position:50% align:center
Please take me off suspension!

00:22:56.334 --> 00:23:00.005 position:50% align:center
[chuckling]

00:23:00.088 --> 00:23:01.423 position:50% align:center
We brought this for the party.

00:23:01.506 --> 00:23:02.966 position:50% align:center
Thank you, we appreciate it.

00:23:03.049 --> 00:23:05.927 position:50% align:center
It's saké. Should help us
make it through this.

00:23:06.011 --> 00:23:08.430 position:50% align:center
You know that Shinra's
too young to drink, right?

00:23:08.513 --> 00:23:11.766 position:50% align:center
Of course. We didn't bring
it for the kid to drink.

00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:14.978 position:50% align:center
It's for adults
like us to enjoy.

00:23:15.061 --> 00:23:17.063 position:50% align:center
You wanna pour, or should I?

00:23:19.399 --> 00:23:22.110 position:50% align:center
I partake only rarely,
my princess.

00:23:22.193 --> 00:23:26.239 position:50% align:center
But here with you tonight...
I have such a thirst.

00:23:26.322 --> 00:23:28.992 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I might have
just a little bit.

00:23:29.075 --> 00:23:30.410 position:50% align:center
She's thick, but underage.

00:23:30.493 --> 00:23:32.829 position:50% align:center
[MAKI]
I am not a chunky hunk of veal!

00:23:32.912 --> 00:23:35.206 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
Never said you were.

00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:36.916 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
So, uh,

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.462 position:50% align:center
it's my pleasure and honor
to be hosting this shindig.

00:23:40.545 --> 00:23:43.048 position:50% align:center
We've gathered here to
congratulate our friend...

00:23:43.131 --> 00:23:45.008 position:50% align:center
[OTHERS chattering]

00:23:45.091 --> 00:23:47.552 position:50% align:center
[OBI] I, of course,
am referring to Shinra...

00:23:47.635 --> 00:23:53.475 position:50% align:center
[ALL chattering]

00:23:53.558 --> 00:23:55.935 position:50% align:center
[MAMORU-KUN]
Thank you for this food.

00:23:56.019 --> 00:23:57.604 position:50% align:center
