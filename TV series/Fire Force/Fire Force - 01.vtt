[ANNOUNCER A] This train's next
stop is at Tabata Station.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.347 position:50% align:center
Amaterasu is operating
at full efficiency.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.724 position:50% align:center
We are running according
to schedule.

[SAFETY OFFICER A]
Get away from the rail lines!

00:01:04.522 --> 00:01:05.690 position:50% align:center
It isn't safe here.

00:01:05.774 --> 00:01:08.360 position:50% align:center
There's a burning train
heading this way! Move!

00:01:12.614 --> 00:01:13.490 position:50% align:center
[SAFETY OFFICER A]
This way! Move...

00:01:13.573 --> 00:01:15.909 position:50% align:center
That looks like a serious fire.

00:01:17.786 --> 00:01:19.287 position:50% align:center
[COMMUTER A]
Think it's an Infernal.

00:01:19.371 --> 00:01:20.580 position:50% align:center
[COMMUTER B]
Another one?

00:01:20.663 --> 00:01:22.415 position:50% align:center
[SAFETY OFFICER A]
...and form an orderly line!

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:24.334 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER B]
...clear the platform at once!

00:01:42.686 --> 00:01:44.604 position:50% align:center
Bet it hurts in there.

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.775 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
I can help you with that.

00:01:48.858 --> 00:01:52.195 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Special Fire Force! Make way!

00:01:52.278 --> 00:01:54.948 position:50% align:center
All civilians
continue to evacuate.

00:01:55.031 --> 00:01:56.241 position:50% align:center
This area's dangerous.

00:01:56.324 --> 00:01:56.991 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Uh.

00:01:57.075 --> 00:01:58.410 position:50% align:center
You, too.

00:01:58.493 --> 00:02:00.578 position:50% align:center
Don't just stand around here,
go and join the others.

00:02:00.662 --> 00:02:01.955 position:50% align:center
Wait. Captain, I think--

00:02:02.038 --> 00:02:04.082 position:50% align:center
Hey, Lieutenant.
Care to join us?

00:02:04.165 --> 00:02:05.917 position:50% align:center
Yes. Of course, sir.

00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:08.378 position:50% align:center
[roars]

00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:10.005 position:50% align:center
Commence the operation.

00:02:10.088 --> 00:02:12.882 position:50% align:center
Note the time as O-810.

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:14.509 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA, IRIS, MAKI]
Yes, sir!

00:02:14.592 --> 00:02:17.512 position:50% align:center
[OBI] Sister, would you
begin the prayer, please?

00:02:17.595 --> 00:02:18.805 position:50% align:center
On it.

00:02:20.515 --> 00:02:22.600 position:50% align:center
The flame is the soul's breath.

00:02:22.684 --> 00:02:25.645 position:50% align:center
The black smoke is
the soul's release.

00:02:26.688 --> 00:02:29.232 position:50% align:center
[INFERNAL roars]

00:02:30.358 --> 00:02:31.693 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Pile bunker's prepped.

00:02:31.776 --> 00:02:33.862 position:50% align:center
I'll bust the core myself!

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.331 position:50% align:center
[IRIS]
Ashes thou wert and art.

00:02:45.415 --> 00:02:46.833 position:50% align:center
May thy soul return...

00:02:46.916 --> 00:02:48.251 position:50% align:center
[OBI yells]

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:51.838 position:50% align:center

<i>Látom</i> .

00:03:01.431 --> 00:03:05.477 position:50% align:center
That was awesome.
What a cool team.

[gasps]

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:19.532 position:50% align:center
[IRIS gasps]

00:03:25.246 --> 00:03:27.665 position:50% align:center
Well, that was close.
You aren't injured, are you?

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:28.958 position:50% align:center
Oh, no.

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:31.294 position:50% align:center
What was that?

00:03:31.378 --> 00:03:32.170 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:32.253 --> 00:03:33.254 position:50% align:center
So you're the one.

00:03:33.338 --> 00:03:37.342 position:50% align:center
Yes! Forgive the late intro.

00:03:37.425 --> 00:03:38.635 position:50% align:center
As of this morning,

00:03:38.718 --> 00:03:42.097 position:50% align:center
I'll be your new
third-generation Fire Soldier.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.226 position:50% align:center
I'm Shinra Kusakabe.
It's an honor to meet you all.

00:03:55.735 --> 00:03:57.153 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Huh.

00:03:57.237 --> 00:04:00.073 position:50% align:center
So these are the "Devil's
Footprints" I've heard about.

00:05:43.218 --> 00:05:45.011 position:50% align:center
I thought Company
Eight was new,

00:05:45.095 --> 00:05:48.515 position:50% align:center
so why's it quartered
in such an old dump?

00:05:48.598 --> 00:05:50.558 position:50% align:center
Too bad.

00:05:50.642 --> 00:05:52.560 position:50% align:center
Shinra, right? Follow me.

00:05:52.644 --> 00:05:53.853 position:50% align:center
Sir!

00:06:09.494 --> 00:06:10.537 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA]
An old dump, huh?

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.706 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
No! It's got character.

00:06:15.083 --> 00:06:16.376 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Reporting in, sir!

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:18.128 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Ah. You made it.

00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:21.381 position:50% align:center
I'm captain of the Special Fire
Force's Company Eight.

00:06:21.464 --> 00:06:23.758 position:50% align:center
The name's Akitaru Obi.

00:06:24.884 --> 00:06:26.761 position:50% align:center
You're greeting
a new team member.

00:06:26.845 --> 00:06:29.139 position:50% align:center
Let's maybe get
off the pullup bar.

00:06:29.222 --> 00:06:30.974 position:50% align:center
Can do.

00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:32.934 position:50% align:center
Takehisa Hinawa.

00:06:33.018 --> 00:06:35.729 position:50% align:center
Around this dump,
I'm second in command.

00:06:38.898 --> 00:06:41.609 position:50% align:center
So hey, Shinra.

00:06:41.693 --> 00:06:43.820 position:50% align:center
About your résumé photo...

00:06:43.903 --> 00:06:45.196 position:50% align:center
Why are you smiling?

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.574 position:50% align:center
Sir! Apologies.

00:06:47.657 --> 00:06:49.993 position:50% align:center
When I'm nervous, my face
compulsively tightens

00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:52.537 position:50% align:center
in such a way that my
teeth are exposed.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:53.788 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:06:53.872 --> 00:06:57.917 position:50% align:center
Uh, that is... I tend to
smile when I feel tense.

00:06:58.001 --> 00:06:59.294 position:50% align:center
--My face--
--[OBI] Hm?

00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:04.049 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Mm...

00:07:05.342 --> 00:07:07.260 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Hmm...

00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:10.096 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:15.268 position:50% align:center
[OBI laughing]

00:07:15.352 --> 00:07:16.728 position:50% align:center
Sorry about that.

00:07:16.811 --> 00:07:19.397 position:50% align:center
Just wanted to see
for myself. You get it.

00:07:19.481 --> 00:07:22.233 position:50% align:center
I bet that cute little quirk
gets you in a lotta trouble.

00:07:22.317 --> 00:07:25.028 position:50% align:center
True. It's caused a few
misunderstandings.

00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:27.447 position:50% align:center
Man, your poker face
must be somethin' else!

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:28.323 position:50% align:center
[OBI laughing]

00:07:28.406 --> 00:07:29.824 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Did he call it cute?

00:07:29.908 --> 00:07:32.160 position:50% align:center
Pretty sure he means creepy.

00:07:32.243 --> 00:07:34.621 position:50% align:center
So tell me, Shinra,

00:07:34.704 --> 00:07:37.624 position:50% align:center
why did you decide to join the
Fire Force in the first place?

00:07:37.707 --> 00:07:39.709 position:50% align:center
Sir!

00:07:39.793 --> 00:07:42.962 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I just
wanted to be a hero.

00:07:43.046 --> 00:07:44.714 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Heh.

00:07:44.798 --> 00:07:46.966 position:50% align:center
Well, that's as fine
an ambition as any,

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:49.219 position:50% align:center
but don't forget
you're part of a team.

00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:53.056 position:50% align:center
Cool-headed co-ordination
saves more lives than heroics.

00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:55.475 position:50% align:center
A hero, huh?

00:07:55.558 --> 00:07:57.143 position:50% align:center
Correct me if I'm wrong,

00:07:57.227 --> 00:07:59.646 position:50% align:center
but that's in stark contrast
with your nickname.

00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:01.106 position:50% align:center
Everybody calls you a devil

00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:04.025 position:50% align:center
due to an incident that took
place when you were young.

00:08:04.109 --> 00:08:06.569 position:50% align:center
If you act like you talk,
you'll do fine.

00:08:06.653 --> 00:08:07.946 position:50% align:center
But if you're just
some delinquent

00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:10.990 position:50% align:center
who's trying to clean
up his reputation,

00:08:11.074 --> 00:08:13.451 position:50% align:center
you may as well walk out now.

00:08:18.456 --> 00:08:19.541 position:50% align:center
[MAKI]
Sister.

00:08:19.624 --> 00:08:22.002 position:50% align:center
[IRIS]
Yes, Maki? What is it?

00:08:22.085 --> 00:08:23.920 position:50% align:center
[MAKI] That new recruit
swept you off your feet

00:08:24.004 --> 00:08:25.547 position:50% align:center
like you were a princess.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:29.509 position:50% align:center
He came outta nowhere and saved
you from danger, so, uh...

00:08:29.592 --> 00:08:32.971 position:50% align:center
Tell me, did you feel
like he might be the one?

00:08:33.054 --> 00:08:34.097 position:50% align:center
[IRIS]
Hm?

00:08:37.976 --> 00:08:42.397 position:50% align:center
[IRIS] Maki always act so fierce
and cool in the field.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.648 position:50% align:center
But the fact is,

00:08:43.732 --> 00:08:46.651 position:50% align:center
her head's stuffed with
flowers and sparkles.

00:08:50.947 --> 00:08:52.198 position:50% align:center
Reporting in, sir!

00:08:52.282 --> 00:08:53.533 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Hm?

00:08:53.616 --> 00:08:56.745 position:50% align:center
Hi, I'd like to thank you
for helping me earlier.

00:08:56.828 --> 00:08:58.788 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sure.

00:09:01.833 --> 00:09:03.460 position:50% align:center
I just did what any hero would.

00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:04.586 position:50% align:center
[MAKI gasps]

00:09:04.669 --> 00:09:06.880 position:50% align:center
Wow, he really is the one.

00:09:10.675 --> 00:09:13.011 position:50% align:center
This is a time for love,
not war, Iris!

00:09:13.094 --> 00:09:14.054 position:50% align:center
And I really don't think

00:09:14.137 --> 00:09:15.221 position:50% align:center
you should stoop
to violence anyway.

00:09:15.305 --> 00:09:17.891 position:50% align:center
I mean, you're a nun,
you silly goober.

00:09:17.974 --> 00:09:21.227 position:50% align:center
[MAKI, IRIS whimpering]

00:09:22.312 --> 00:09:23.813 position:50% align:center
[MAKI] I adjusted the
length of your pants

00:09:23.897 --> 00:09:26.566 position:50% align:center
to accommodate that
ability of yours.

00:09:26.649 --> 00:09:28.735 position:50% align:center
Do you think they're
gonna work for you?

00:09:28.818 --> 00:09:31.571 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Thank you very--

00:09:31.654 --> 00:09:32.655 position:50% align:center
[MAKI]
Hm?

00:09:34.157 --> 00:09:36.493 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Why does she smell so good?

00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:39.037 position:50% align:center
[OBI] Easy, Turbo. You look
like you wanna eat her.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.246 position:50% align:center
Say what?

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.832 position:50% align:center
I already explained,
it's an involuntary--

00:09:48.296 --> 00:09:49.714 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Hm?

00:09:49.798 --> 00:09:54.302 position:50% align:center
Well, I think it's just
about time, Captain.

00:09:54.386 --> 00:09:58.890 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Everyone's here now,
so let's get started.

00:10:01.768 --> 00:10:05.063 position:50% align:center
[OBI] All of us know about
spontaneous human combustion,

00:10:05.146 --> 00:10:09.359 position:50% align:center
but no one, not even us here,
knows when it'll happen next,

00:10:09.442 --> 00:10:10.527 position:50% align:center
or to whom.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:13.196 position:50% align:center
And so, we all live in fear.

00:10:15.824 --> 00:10:18.451 position:50% align:center
[OBI] One day, without
cause or warning,

00:10:18.535 --> 00:10:21.204 position:50% align:center
people the world over
began catching fire.

00:10:21.287 --> 00:10:23.289 position:50% align:center
These were the
first-generation victims

00:10:23.373 --> 00:10:25.625 position:50% align:center
of spontaneous human combustion.

00:10:25.709 --> 00:10:28.294 position:50% align:center
They, and those like them
who've come since,

00:10:28.378 --> 00:10:30.005 position:50% align:center
are called Infernals.

00:10:30.088 --> 00:10:34.342 position:50% align:center
Having lost all sense of self,
they run rampant until they die.

00:10:34.426 --> 00:10:36.261 position:50% align:center
Those deaths don't come easy.

00:10:36.344 --> 00:10:39.848 position:50% align:center
To put an Infernal to rest,
you have to destroy its core

00:10:39.931 --> 00:10:43.059 position:50% align:center
by striking where the
victim's heart was.

00:10:43.143 --> 00:10:44.811 position:50% align:center
The Special Fire
Force's main duty

00:10:44.894 --> 00:10:46.896 position:50% align:center
is to put Infernals to rest,

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:50.692 position:50% align:center
saving their souls and
human lives in the process.

00:10:50.775 --> 00:10:52.610 position:50% align:center
But we all have
another objective.

00:10:52.694 --> 00:10:55.989 position:50% align:center
That's to solve the mystery of
what causes human combustion.

00:10:56.072 --> 00:10:57.782 position:50% align:center
And with luck, to stop it,

00:10:57.866 --> 00:11:01.202 position:50% align:center
and put an end to the terror
of the flame for good.

00:11:01.286 --> 00:11:03.371 position:50% align:center
As quickly as we can.

00:11:05.832 --> 00:11:08.001 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]

No. I have to become one.

Mother.

00:11:24.893 --> 00:11:26.936 position:50% align:center
Hey, Mom! Guess what?

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:28.980 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna be a superhero!

00:11:29.064 --> 00:11:31.316 position:50% align:center
I'll keep you and
Sho safe forever!

00:11:31.399 --> 00:11:33.401 position:50% align:center
Well, that sure sounds cool.

00:11:33.485 --> 00:11:34.819 position:50% align:center

00:11:37.989 --> 00:11:39.199 position:50% align:center

[SHINRA'S GRANDMOTHER]
No, I won't "take him in"!

00:11:42.243 --> 00:11:43.828 position:50% align:center
That boy is dangerous.

00:11:43.912 --> 00:11:46.247 position:50% align:center
[GOVERNMENT AGENT A] Please,
ma'am. He's your grandson.

00:11:46.331 --> 00:11:48.041 position:50% align:center
Don't say anything
you'll regret.

00:11:48.124 --> 00:11:49.584 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA'S GRANDMOTHER]
I'll say what I know.

00:11:49.668 --> 00:11:51.878 position:50% align:center
That is no grandson of mine.

00:11:51.961 --> 00:11:54.589 position:50% align:center
Do you have any idea
what he's done?

00:11:54.673 --> 00:11:58.134 position:50% align:center
And look at him.
Not a shred of remorse.

00:11:58.218 --> 00:12:01.304 position:50% align:center
He's grinning like
the devil he is.

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:09.521 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] I made a promise,
and I'll keep it.

[alarm blaring]

00:12:14.901 --> 00:12:16.069 position:50% align:center
The alarm!

00:12:16.152 --> 00:12:18.154 position:50% align:center
[MAKI] Shinra! Someone
just turned Infernal!

00:12:18.238 --> 00:12:19.989 position:50% align:center
Be ready in 30 seconds!

00:12:20.073 --> 00:12:21.116 position:50% align:center
On it!

00:12:26.746 --> 00:12:30.375 position:50% align:center
Our Infernal is in Taito
ward, Torigoe District.

00:12:30.458 --> 00:12:32.711 position:50% align:center
The fire's at a small factory.

00:12:32.794 --> 00:12:36.631 position:50% align:center
The person who turned Infernal
is the factory manager's wife.

[OBI]
We'll work with Squad Four

00:12:48.018 --> 00:12:50.562 position:50% align:center

Agency's Ueno branch

00:12:50.645 --> 00:12:52.439 position:50% align:center
and put her to rest.

Let's do this!

[ANNOUNCER A] Emergency vehicles

We request that all
civilian motorists

00:13:18.757 --> 00:13:20.759 position:50% align:center

It's the Blue Stripes.

00:14:01.007 --> 00:14:02.133 position:50% align:center
[FIREFIGHTER CAPTAIN A]
From what we've been seeing,

00:14:02.217 --> 00:14:04.594 position:50% align:center
this Infernal is
especially aggressive.

00:14:04.678 --> 00:14:07.263 position:50% align:center
We've been able to keep
the flames contained so far,

00:14:07.347 --> 00:14:09.307 position:50% align:center
but as long as the
Infernal's active,

00:14:09.391 --> 00:14:10.517 position:50% align:center
there's a risk that more build--

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.268 position:50% align:center
Excuse me.

00:14:13.561 --> 00:14:15.271 position:50% align:center
[MANAGER]
Please help my wife, Sister.

00:14:15.355 --> 00:14:17.399 position:50% align:center
See that she's put to rest.

00:14:17.482 --> 00:14:20.735 position:50% align:center
[IRIS] Infernals are lost
souls shrouded in flame.

00:14:20.819 --> 00:14:22.570 position:50% align:center
We'll offer your wife mercy,

00:14:22.654 --> 00:14:26.282 position:50% align:center
and a return to the embrace
of the great god Sol.

Yup. My little hero.

[OBI]
She's further in.

00:15:00.191 --> 00:15:02.652 position:50% align:center
[MAKI] These flames,
they feel conscious,

00:15:02.736 --> 00:15:05.071 position:50% align:center
like they're actively
trying to stop us.

00:15:05.155 --> 00:15:07.073 position:50% align:center
[IRIS] This place
must've been important.

00:15:07.157 --> 00:15:08.992 position:50% align:center

Huh? I was just...

00:15:31.222 --> 00:15:33.683 position:50% align:center
[OBI] You still wanna
be a hero, don't you?

00:15:33.767 --> 00:15:36.853 position:50% align:center
Listen, Fire Soldiers don't
abandon their comrades.

00:15:36.936 --> 00:15:40.231 position:50% align:center
When you fall behind, we all do.

00:15:40.315 --> 00:15:42.275 position:50% align:center
The bright blue stripes
that ring our bodies

00:15:42.359 --> 00:15:43.818 position:50% align:center
aren't just for show,

00:15:43.902 --> 00:15:45.987 position:50% align:center
they're what bind
us all together.

00:15:46.071 --> 00:15:48.907 position:50% align:center
In this hellscape
of smoke and flame,

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:50.784 position:50% align:center
trust in that bond.

00:15:50.867 --> 00:15:53.286 position:50% align:center
The fear you feel
is a survival tool.

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:55.372 position:50% align:center
It helps to keep you alive.

00:15:55.455 --> 00:15:57.874 position:50% align:center
Just don't let it
make you a coward.

00:16:02.671 --> 00:16:04.339 position:50% align:center
Understood, sir.

Don't look, honey.

00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:39.082 position:50% align:center
You need to run away! Hurry!

00:16:41.793 --> 00:16:43.086 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Mom.

00:16:45.338 --> 00:16:47.424 position:50% align:center
[PASSERBY A]
That's her eldest son Shinra.

00:16:47.507 --> 00:16:49.551 position:50% align:center
They say he caused the fire.

00:16:49.634 --> 00:16:52.095 position:50% align:center
[PASSERBY B] His younger brother
Sho was burnt completely.

00:16:52.178 --> 00:16:54.180 position:50% align:center
They couldn't even
find his bones.

00:16:54.264 --> 00:16:56.933 position:50% align:center
[PASSERBY A] I heard them say
that he's a third-generation.

00:16:57.017 --> 00:16:58.643 position:50% align:center
They can create fire at will.

00:16:58.727 --> 00:17:00.937 position:50% align:center
[PASSERBY C]
How terrifying.

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:06.067 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
I can't run away from this.

00:17:06.151 --> 00:17:07.986 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
It wasn't me.

00:17:09.279 --> 00:17:10.780 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
When my home burned,

00:17:10.864 --> 00:17:14.409 position:50% align:center
I saw someone, or something...

00:17:15.744 --> 00:17:20.498 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Something other
than Mom, or Sho, or me.

00:17:22.751 --> 00:17:25.295 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
And I'm gonna find out what.

00:17:25.378 --> 00:17:27.922 position:50% align:center
[PASSERBY A] That smile
of his--it's so creepy.

00:17:28.006 --> 00:17:29.424 position:50% align:center
He's a psychopath.

00:17:29.507 --> 00:17:30.925 position:50% align:center
A devil.

00:17:33.136 --> 00:17:37.807 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Since that day,
I haven't truly smiled once.

[SHINRA]
What's with this blue light?

00:17:51.654 --> 00:17:54.199 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA] You know, with a
badass nickname like "Devil,"

00:17:54.282 --> 00:17:55.867 position:50% align:center
I figured you'd be tougher.

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:57.035 position:50% align:center
Try to sit up.

00:17:57.118 --> 00:18:00.872 position:50% align:center
I must've been out
for a while. How long?

00:18:00.955 --> 00:18:03.541 position:50% align:center
You're fine. It was
like five seconds.

00:18:03.625 --> 00:18:05.293 position:50% align:center
Now get up already.

00:18:05.377 --> 00:18:07.045 position:50% align:center
We're gonna need
you in action soon.

00:18:07.128 --> 00:18:08.713 position:50% align:center
[MAKI] How do you feel?
Can you fight?

00:18:08.797 --> 00:18:10.048 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

I made two promises.

00:19:32.005 --> 00:19:35.925 position:50% align:center
That I'd be a hero, and
that I'd protect my family.

00:19:39.846 --> 00:19:43.391 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Mom. Sho. I'm sorry.

00:19:43.475 --> 00:19:47.020 position:50% align:center
I couldn't keep
that last promise.

00:19:47.103 --> 00:19:50.523 position:50% align:center
But I'll honor your memory
by becoming a hero.

I refuse to be what
they say I am.

No matter what I have
to do, I will be a hero!

All set. Make me proud, hero!

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:23.515 position:50% align:center
