[OBI] Causes of death
are many and varied.

00:00:14.806 --> 00:00:18.184 position:50% align:center
Old age. Illness. Suicide.

00:00:18.268 --> 00:00:19.978 position:50% align:center
But out of that long,
morbid list,

00:00:20.061 --> 00:00:23.690 position:50% align:center
there's one end that people
fear above all others...

00:00:26.651 --> 00:00:28.611 position:50% align:center line:10%
[OBI]
Death by fire.

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:42.417 position:50% align:center
You are aware of what's
going on in the world?

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.295 position:50% align:center
The chaos that consumes it?

00:00:45.378 --> 00:00:47.630 position:50% align:center
The planet is in shambles.

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:50.508 position:50% align:center
Space distorts in areas
where the flames rise,

00:00:50.592 --> 00:00:52.260 position:50% align:center
carving up continents.

00:00:52.344 --> 00:00:53.595 position:50% align:center
Maps are being redrawn,

00:00:53.678 --> 00:00:56.973 position:50% align:center
and many countries that
once existed have fallen.

00:00:57.057 --> 00:00:59.059 position:50% align:center
These days, there are few places

00:00:59.142 --> 00:01:00.810 position:50% align:center
where you can live
a decent life--

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:02.979 position:50% align:center
other than the Tokyo Empire.

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:07.609 position:50% align:center
And so, people gather here in
the relatively undamaged Tokyo,

00:01:07.692 --> 00:01:08.943 position:50% align:center
where the Holy Sol Temple

00:01:09.027 --> 00:01:12.322 position:50% align:center
and Haijima Industries have
developed Amaterasu,

00:01:12.405 --> 00:01:14.949 position:50% align:center
the perpetual thermal
energy plant.

00:01:15.033 --> 00:01:18.161 position:50% align:center
The empire is the beneficiary
of its vast energy,

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:20.997 position:50% align:center
and has made further
advancements of its own.

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:24.459 position:50% align:center
Can we get down to it,
or does this story keep going?

00:01:24.542 --> 00:01:26.252 position:50% align:center
[MAN B]
Eh. Who can say?

00:01:26.336 --> 00:01:30.382 position:50% align:center
Personally, I would very much
like for it to continue.

00:01:30.465 --> 00:01:32.133 position:50% align:center
So how'd it go?

00:01:32.217 --> 00:01:34.260 position:50% align:center
Used the stuff I had
you make for me.

00:01:34.344 --> 00:01:37.055 position:50% align:center
The results were more
than satisfactory.

00:01:37.138 --> 00:01:38.306 position:50% align:center
I did a little digging

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.975 position:50% align:center
into Special Fire
Force Company 8.

00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:43.728 position:50% align:center
I found out something
interesting.

00:01:43.812 --> 00:01:45.355 position:50% align:center
Their captain, Akitaru Obi,

00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:48.149 position:50% align:center
was decorated twice
in his firefighter days.

00:01:48.233 --> 00:01:51.528 position:50% align:center
He was later stripped
of both medals.

00:01:51.611 --> 00:01:53.988 position:50% align:center
Both times it was
because he defied orders

00:01:54.072 --> 00:01:56.491 position:50% align:center
and put human lives first.

00:01:56.574 --> 00:01:58.034 position:50% align:center
Oh, did he, now?

00:01:58.118 --> 00:01:59.244 position:50% align:center
For better or worse,

00:01:59.327 --> 00:02:01.955 position:50% align:center
seems the captain was
a model firefighter.

00:02:02.038 --> 00:02:03.790 position:50% align:center
He's the cornerstone.

00:02:03.873 --> 00:02:05.834 position:50% align:center
Company 8 was built
around that man's

00:02:05.917 --> 00:02:08.461 position:50% align:center
magnetism and strength
of character.

00:02:08.545 --> 00:02:11.589 position:50% align:center
They're a different breed
than the other companies.

00:02:11.673 --> 00:02:13.591 position:50% align:center
It's fascinating.

00:03:53.775 --> 00:03:56.486 position:50% align:center
Yeah! The Rookie Games are here!

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.029 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
Tamaki Kotatsu.

00:03:58.113 --> 00:03:59.948 position:50% align:center
Ready to kick some butt!

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:09.833 position:50% align:center
Huh? Wanna tell me what
you're starin' at, loser?

00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:11.710 position:50% align:center
Nothing.

[SHINRA]
"Wone Wone" what?

00:04:16.297 --> 00:04:17.382 position:50% align:center
[MAKI]
You don't know them?

00:04:17.465 --> 00:04:19.426 position:50% align:center
They're the Fire Defense
Agency's mascots.

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:21.302 position:50% align:center
Wone Wone Nyine!

00:04:21.386 --> 00:04:24.055 position:50% align:center
These are our mascots?
Even the old dude?

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.808 position:50% align:center
Oh. His name is Mamoru.

00:04:26.891 --> 00:04:28.560 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Whatever you say.

00:04:28.643 --> 00:04:30.895 position:50% align:center
[MAKI] Initially the characters
were two dogs and a cat,

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:32.105 position:50% align:center
but for whatever reason,

00:04:32.188 --> 00:04:33.732 position:50% align:center
the higher-ups at
the Agency complained

00:04:33.815 --> 00:04:35.358 position:50% align:center
about all of them being animals.

00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:36.943 position:50% align:center
So they switched
things up a little

00:04:37.027 --> 00:04:38.278 position:50% align:center
and made one of them an old man

00:04:38.361 --> 00:04:40.989 position:50% align:center
who kinda looks like
a dog instead.

00:04:41.072 --> 00:04:43.700 position:50% align:center
If you ask me, they'd be
better off with the two dogs.

00:04:43.783 --> 00:04:46.995 position:50% align:center
Huh? But Mamoru is adorable!

00:04:47.078 --> 00:04:48.079 position:50% align:center
Him?

00:04:48.163 --> 00:04:50.498 position:50% align:center

Mh-hm. Mh-hm.

00:04:50.582 --> 00:04:51.750 position:50% align:center
Him?

00:04:51.833 --> 00:04:53.877 position:50% align:center

Mh-hm. Mh-hm.

00:05:18.818 --> 00:05:20.779 position:50% align:center
No, it can't be.

00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:26.534 position:50% align:center
Excuse me!

00:05:26.618 --> 00:05:27.869 position:50% align:center
[BURNS]
Hm?

00:05:27.952 --> 00:05:30.038 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:05:30.121 --> 00:05:32.415 position:50% align:center
Can I help you with something?

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:35.043 position:50% align:center
You one of the new recruits
here for the games?

00:05:35.126 --> 00:05:36.294 position:50% align:center
Yes!

00:05:36.378 --> 00:05:40.548 position:50% align:center
Fire Force Company 8,
sir. Shinra Kusakabe.

00:05:40.632 --> 00:05:43.301 position:50% align:center
Sorry. Mind if I ask
some questions?

00:05:43.385 --> 00:05:45.637 position:50% align:center
It's about that
fire 12 years ago.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.098 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid I haven't got
time to chat right now.

00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:49.391 position:50% align:center
Good luck.

00:05:49.474 --> 00:05:50.684 position:50% align:center
I just need a sec--

00:05:50.767 --> 00:05:51.685 position:50% align:center
Watch it!

00:05:51.768 --> 00:05:52.894 position:50% align:center
Who exactly do you
think you are,

00:05:52.977 --> 00:05:55.105 position:50% align:center
talking to my captain
like that, you jerk?

It's not fair!

00:06:10.203 --> 00:06:12.080 position:50% align:center
Why does my lucky lecher
lure always flare up

00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:13.832 position:50% align:center
at the worst possible moment?

00:06:13.915 --> 00:06:15.458 position:50% align:center
I don't know why you'd
call that lucky,

00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:18.336 position:50% align:center
but I think I'm
flaring up a bit myself.

00:06:22.757 --> 00:06:24.676 position:50% align:center
This won't take long, Captain.

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:26.428 position:50% align:center
Can I just have a moment?

your name was Shinra?

Do you have the slightest idea

00:06:37.272 --> 00:06:39.774 position:50% align:center
how many fires break out
in any given year?

00:06:39.858 --> 00:06:42.277 position:50% align:center
Sorry to disappoint,
but you can't expect me

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.071 position:50% align:center
to remember one
from 12 years ago.

Go and get ready.

you'll find a

Your objectives are as follows:

00:07:07.302 --> 00:07:10.847 position:50% align:center
Overcome the obstacles within,
rescue any who require it,

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:12.766 position:50% align:center
and be the first one
to reach the crewman

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:14.976 position:50% align:center
who's posing as an Infernal.

00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:20.440 position:50% align:center
So that's it.
We storm the castle.

know about that?

about these two

If these men are making
it hard for you to focus...

I'll have to kill them.

Oh, I'll tell you,

but only if you manage
to entertain me first.

00:10:55.989 --> 00:10:59.909 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
He... He's gonna kill me.

00:10:59.993 --> 00:11:02.871 position:50% align:center
Wow, that's a hell of
a face you're making.

00:11:02.954 --> 00:11:06.374 position:50% align:center
You can smile even
at a time like this?

00:11:06.458 --> 00:11:08.543 position:50% align:center
You're tougher than I thought.

00:11:08.626 --> 00:11:10.628 position:50% align:center
You've earned a reward:

00:11:10.712 --> 00:11:11.755 position:50% align:center
I'll tell you something about

00:11:11.838 --> 00:11:14.883 position:50% align:center
what really happened
in that fire.

00:11:18.219 --> 00:11:20.680 position:50% align:center
Here's hint number one:

00:11:20.764 --> 00:11:23.558 position:50% align:center
Your little brother is alive.

00:11:25.143 --> 00:11:29.105 position:50% align:center
My brother? Sho is still alive?

00:11:30.648 --> 00:11:32.108 position:50% align:center
What are you saying?

00:11:32.192 --> 00:11:34.736 position:50% align:center
They told me he burned
to death, bones and all.

00:11:34.819 --> 00:11:38.531 position:50% align:center
Besides, if he is alive,
where has he been all this time?

00:11:38.615 --> 00:11:42.452 position:50% align:center
He was a baby when it
happened--only one year old!

00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:44.245 position:50% align:center
It's starting to
sound like someone's

00:11:44.329 --> 00:11:46.331 position:50% align:center
been hiding something,
doesn't it?

00:11:46.414 --> 00:11:48.875 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
You expect me to believe that?

00:11:55.882 --> 00:11:57.342 position:50% align:center
I saw that look.

00:11:57.425 --> 00:12:00.762 position:50% align:center
What's the matter, kid,
you have someone in mind?

00:12:01.846 --> 00:12:05.517 position:50% align:center
Even if that's really true,
how would you know about it?

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:08.395 position:50% align:center
And why would you go out
of your way to tell me?

00:12:08.478 --> 00:12:12.357 position:50% align:center
What are you after?
Why did you come here?

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.317 position:50% align:center
I'm glad to see I've
finally secured

00:12:14.401 --> 00:12:16.194 position:50% align:center
your undivided attention.

00:12:16.277 --> 00:12:19.531 position:50% align:center
You show promise, and I'd
hate for it to go to waste.

00:12:19.614 --> 00:12:20.824 position:50% align:center
From the way you're acting,

00:12:20.907 --> 00:12:22.992 position:50% align:center
I'm guessing you've got
your own suspicions

00:12:23.076 --> 00:12:25.537 position:50% align:center
about the noble Fire Force.

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.080 position:50% align:center
And who can blame you?

00:12:27.163 --> 00:12:29.791 position:50% align:center
Your mother is dead.

00:12:29.874 --> 00:12:34.254 position:50% align:center
You wanna know
the truth, don't you?

00:12:34.337 --> 00:12:35.714 position:50% align:center
If you wanna know what happened,

00:12:35.797 --> 00:12:37.340 position:50% align:center
you have to quit
playing the hero

00:12:37.424 --> 00:12:41.261 position:50% align:center
with your Fire Soldier buddies
and come be a devil with me.

00:12:41.344 --> 00:12:45.265 position:50% align:center
That's my choice, hero or devil?

00:12:45.348 --> 00:12:46.474 position:50% align:center
Screw you!

00:12:46.558 --> 00:12:48.601 position:50% align:center
I don't care who you
are or what you know,

00:12:48.685 --> 00:12:51.187 position:50% align:center
you still assaulted
two Fire Soldiers.

00:12:51.271 --> 00:12:54.399 position:50% align:center
So I'm gonna bring you in
after I kick your ass!

00:12:54.482 --> 00:12:58.278 position:50% align:center
Well, you're no fun.
And I had such high hopes.

00:12:59.237 --> 00:13:02.699 position:50% align:center
A flying kick? That
leaves you wide open.

00:13:04.159 --> 00:13:05.243 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:12.542 --> 00:13:15.587 position:50% align:center
A flying kick is the
mark of a true hero!

00:13:19.466 --> 00:13:21.092 position:50% align:center
Now that was impressive.

00:13:21.176 --> 00:13:24.637 position:50% align:center
Nice to see a devil's
firepower in action.

00:13:46.534 --> 00:13:47.660 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
Hmph.

00:13:52.874 --> 00:13:54.709 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI screams]

00:13:57.545 --> 00:14:00.840 position:50% align:center
Ow! That's gonna leave a mark!

00:14:04.678 --> 00:14:07.889 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI] I'm sensing
something nasty up ahead.

00:14:07.972 --> 00:14:10.600 position:50% align:center
Whatever it is,
it smells like danger.

00:14:10.684 --> 00:14:12.894 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR] I am not a
knight-shaped seat cushion.

00:14:12.977 --> 00:14:14.229 position:50% align:center
Kindly move.

00:14:14.312 --> 00:14:15.689 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:14:15.772 --> 00:14:18.274 position:50% align:center
Hey! What were you doing
down there, sicko?!

00:14:18.358 --> 00:14:21.486 position:50% align:center
I am not a knight-shaped
punching bag, either.

00:14:29.953 --> 00:14:32.038 position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:14:32.122 --> 00:14:33.123 position:50% align:center
Watch out!

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:38.378 position:50% align:center
This dragged on too long--
now we've got an audience.

00:14:38.461 --> 00:14:40.839 position:50% align:center
"Infernal." Sorry to keep you.

00:14:40.922 --> 00:14:42.048 position:50% align:center
Arthur!

00:14:42.132 --> 00:14:43.967 position:50% align:center
A suspicious man has
infiltrated the games

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:45.802 position:50% align:center
and injured two crewmen.

00:14:45.885 --> 00:14:48.054 position:50% align:center
Go report to the
captains outside!

00:14:48.138 --> 00:14:49.639 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah?

00:14:50.765 --> 00:14:51.808 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:54.602 position:50% align:center
Clearly you lie,
but I won't be duped.

00:14:54.686 --> 00:14:55.645 position:50% align:center
What?

00:14:55.729 --> 00:14:57.063 position:50% align:center
Victory is mine!

00:14:57.147 --> 00:14:59.899 position:50% align:center
[yells] You stupid knight!

00:15:02.944 --> 00:15:05.321 position:50% align:center
How's wavin' that sword
around like an idiot

00:15:05.405 --> 00:15:07.365 position:50% align:center
gonna help you catch me?

00:15:09.117 --> 00:15:11.453 position:50% align:center
Out of the way.
It's my turn now!

00:15:11.536 --> 00:15:14.414 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:15:16.416 --> 00:15:18.626 position:50% align:center
Ha! Gotcha!

00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:19.711 position:50% align:center
Hm?

00:15:24.174 --> 00:15:26.634 position:50% align:center
This kinda seems like overkill
for the Rookie Games.

00:15:26.718 --> 00:15:30.096 position:50% align:center
Like I told you before:
He's not part of the games.

00:15:32.098 --> 00:15:36.978 position:50% align:center
Okay, Shinra, if you're really
that determined to be a hero,

00:15:37.062 --> 00:15:38.146 position:50% align:center
then let's see if you can get

00:15:38.229 --> 00:15:40.690 position:50% align:center
every person out of
this building alive.

00:15:40.774 --> 00:15:43.360 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Hm? More of that stuff?

00:15:46.404 --> 00:15:47.781 position:50% align:center
What's that?

00:15:47.864 --> 00:15:49.199 position:50% align:center
Ashes?

00:15:50.575 --> 00:15:52.702 position:50% align:center
Well, catch ya later, Devil.

00:15:52.786 --> 00:15:55.330 position:50% align:center
Remember, if you ever wanna
team up with the Joker,

00:15:55.413 --> 00:15:58.041 position:50% align:center
I'll be happy to take you in.

00:16:00.919 --> 00:16:04.089 position:50% align:center
[JOKER]
Good luck.

00:16:04.172 --> 00:16:05.590 position:50% align:center
We have to get outta here!

00:16:05.674 --> 00:16:07.175 position:50% align:center
It's gonna blow!

00:16:12.972 --> 00:16:16.851 position:50% align:center
Arthur, the ceiling!
We'll go that way.

00:16:18.395 --> 00:16:20.480 position:50% align:center
Who are you to give
orders to me?

00:16:20.563 --> 00:16:22.607 position:50% align:center
You're no fair princess!

00:16:28.238 --> 00:16:29.948 position:50% align:center
My cuts were too
perfectly executed

00:16:30.031 --> 00:16:31.366 position:50% align:center
to bring the ceiling down.

00:16:31.449 --> 00:16:32.534 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
Move it!

00:16:32.617 --> 00:16:33.910 position:50% align:center
We need a way out, right?

00:16:33.993 --> 00:16:37.831 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI yells]

00:16:42.544 --> 00:16:44.379 position:50% align:center
Grab on, you two!

00:16:47.173 --> 00:16:49.050 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
I'm saving 'em all!

00:16:57.851 --> 00:17:01.021 position:50% align:center
[JOKER]
Hero or devil?

00:17:01.104 --> 00:17:02.647 position:50% align:center
Shut up, you jerk!

00:17:02.731 --> 00:17:06.151 position:50% align:center
Of course I'm a hero.
I'm a Fire Soldier!

00:17:11.489 --> 00:17:13.783 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Arthur! Cat Girl!

00:17:13.867 --> 00:17:16.661 position:50% align:center
Ah! Help!

00:17:16.745 --> 00:17:18.538 position:50% align:center
God save me.

00:17:19.998 --> 00:17:21.958 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
Captain Burns!

00:17:23.543 --> 00:17:25.045 position:50% align:center
[BURNS]
She's okay.

00:17:25.128 --> 00:17:27.881 position:50% align:center
Make sure those two
reach the ground safely.

00:17:27.964 --> 00:17:29.424 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:17:29.507 --> 00:17:31.676 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
So what about me?

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:33.303 position:50% align:center
[BURNS]
Look down.

00:17:34.763 --> 00:17:36.890 position:50% align:center
Don't you punk
out on us, Arthur!

00:17:36.973 --> 00:17:39.726 position:50% align:center
Show us the fighting
spirit of the 8!

00:17:39.809 --> 00:17:42.020 position:50% align:center
Not too sure what he means.

00:17:42.103 --> 00:17:44.939 position:50% align:center
How am I supposed
to fall with spirit?

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:53.156 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
Ow.

00:17:53.239 --> 00:17:55.992 position:50% align:center
It's pretty lucky that
you're all so muscular.

00:17:56.076 --> 00:17:58.745 position:50% align:center
Who are you calling a
doped-up neanderthal?

00:17:58.828 --> 00:18:00.413 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
That's not what I said.

00:18:06.795 --> 00:18:08.213 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:18:11.299 --> 00:18:12.634 position:50% align:center
[FIREMAN A]
Is anyone hurt?

00:18:12.717 --> 00:18:14.719 position:50% align:center
[FIREMAN B] We need to get
further back just in case.

00:18:14.803 --> 00:18:16.680 position:50% align:center
No one else is in there, right?

00:18:18.306 --> 00:18:19.849 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Hm?

00:18:19.933 --> 00:18:22.352 position:50% align:center
Thanks for takin' care
of my subordinate here.

00:18:22.435 --> 00:18:25.438 position:50% align:center
But for the record, I could've
gotten out by myself.

00:18:25.522 --> 00:18:27.816 position:50% align:center
That was impressive, Shinra.

00:18:27.899 --> 00:18:29.526 position:50% align:center
You did well.

00:18:31.611 --> 00:18:34.155 position:50% align:center
You're giving me more
credit than I deserve.

00:18:34.239 --> 00:18:35.990 position:50% align:center
But thanks anyway.

00:18:36.074 --> 00:18:37.909 position:50% align:center
Shinra, there you are!

00:18:37.992 --> 00:18:40.829 position:50% align:center
Not too shabby. You saved
four more people!

00:18:40.912 --> 00:18:42.580 position:50% align:center
Might have to get
you a cape soon.

00:18:42.664 --> 00:18:45.291 position:50% align:center
I appreciate it, sir.

00:18:45.375 --> 00:18:48.461 position:50% align:center
[BURNS]
Well, we'll be going now.

00:18:53.341 --> 00:18:56.845 position:50% align:center
[BURNS] Tamaki, I'll need a
full report on what happened.

00:18:56.928 --> 00:18:58.263 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
Yes, sir!

00:18:59.931 --> 00:19:02.434 position:50% align:center
That's a good
soldier you've got.

00:19:13.737 --> 00:19:15.071 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:19:15.155 --> 00:19:16.406 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Hm?

00:19:18.783 --> 00:19:21.369 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] I ran into a
strange man in there.

00:19:21.453 --> 00:19:23.121 position:50% align:center
Someone who could
control explosions

00:19:23.204 --> 00:19:25.915 position:50% align:center
with some kind of powder.

00:19:25.999 --> 00:19:28.001 position:50% align:center
What I saw from him was
a lot like what I saw

00:19:28.084 --> 00:19:30.086 position:50% align:center
at that fire scene
the other day.

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:33.673 position:50% align:center
Also, he seemed
to know something.

00:19:33.757 --> 00:19:36.217 position:50% align:center
Captain, I have to ask.

00:19:36.301 --> 00:19:39.346 position:50% align:center
Is the Special Fire Force
hiding anything?

00:19:39.429 --> 00:19:41.181 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Look, Shinra--

00:19:41.264 --> 00:19:43.641 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Before you tell
me something else,

00:19:43.725 --> 00:19:45.685 position:50% align:center
the Special Fire Force
really is fighting

00:19:45.769 --> 00:19:47.896 position:50% align:center
for the good of everyone, right?

00:19:47.979 --> 00:19:51.274 position:50% align:center
I joined up to keep
people safe, sir.

00:19:51.358 --> 00:19:52.942 position:50% align:center
Tell me we're heroes.

00:19:53.026 --> 00:19:56.529 position:50% align:center
Please tell me we're fighting
back the terror of the flame.

00:19:59.074 --> 00:20:01.326 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Yes, we are.

00:20:01.409 --> 00:20:04.788 position:50% align:center
That said, the Special
Fire Force isn't exactly

00:20:04.871 --> 00:20:07.207 position:50% align:center
one monolithic organization.

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:10.335 position:50% align:center
It was formed with personnel
from three factions:

00:20:10.418 --> 00:20:13.755 position:50% align:center
The Holy Sol Temple,
the Tokyo Armed Forces,

00:20:13.838 --> 00:20:16.174 position:50% align:center
and the Fire Defense Agency.

00:20:16.257 --> 00:20:21.680 position:50% align:center
Fact is, most companies still
answer to one entity or another.

00:20:21.763 --> 00:20:25.141 position:50% align:center
The influence of the Temple
is strong at the 1st.

00:20:25.225 --> 00:20:28.978 position:50% align:center
The 2nd reports directly
to the Tokyo Armed Forces.

00:20:29.062 --> 00:20:30.730 position:50% align:center
And at the 5th Company,

00:20:30.814 --> 00:20:34.442 position:50% align:center
the real power is held
by Haijima Industries.

00:20:34.526 --> 00:20:38.863 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Haijima? How do
they play into this?

00:20:38.947 --> 00:20:42.701 position:50% align:center
[OBI] All the equipment we Fire
Soldiers use is made by Haijima.

00:20:42.784 --> 00:20:45.120 position:50% align:center
They're more than
just some corporation.

00:20:45.203 --> 00:20:47.539 position:50% align:center
We need them to operate.

00:20:47.622 --> 00:20:50.917 position:50% align:center
They have interests throughout
the nation, and lots of capital,

00:20:51.001 --> 00:20:53.753 position:50% align:center
so they've become
our sole supplier.

00:20:53.837 --> 00:20:56.047 position:50% align:center
It's true that each
company does its duty

00:20:56.131 --> 00:20:59.092 position:50% align:center
to fight for the people
and put Infernals to rest,

00:20:59.175 --> 00:21:03.138 position:50% align:center
while seeking the cause of
spontaneous human combustion.

00:21:03.221 --> 00:21:06.307 position:50% align:center
However, the companies
see each other as rivals

00:21:06.391 --> 00:21:09.728 position:50% align:center
and keep what knowledge
they gain to themselves.

00:21:09.811 --> 00:21:11.938 position:50% align:center
Nothing is shared between them.

00:21:12.022 --> 00:21:17.027 position:50% align:center
Not even information about the
truth behind human combustion.

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:20.447 position:50% align:center
I believe in this organization,
but some companies

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:23.241 position:50% align:center
may have their own
dubious motives.

00:21:23.324 --> 00:21:25.702 position:50% align:center
Since I can't trust
all its members,

00:21:25.785 --> 00:21:28.455 position:50% align:center
I'm forced to be suspicious
of the larger group.

00:21:28.538 --> 00:21:29.664 position:50% align:center
Wait a second.

00:21:29.748 --> 00:21:33.335 position:50% align:center
Does Company 8 have
its own motives, too?

00:21:33.418 --> 00:21:36.046 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I suppose
you could say that.

00:21:36.129 --> 00:21:39.716 position:50% align:center
A group within the agency
strong-armed us into existence.

00:21:39.799 --> 00:21:44.554 position:50% align:center
They wanted a team led by me.
One they could trust completely.

00:21:44.637 --> 00:21:47.640 position:50% align:center
Our goal is to investigate
Companies 1 through 7

00:21:47.724 --> 00:21:50.185 position:50% align:center
so we can zero in on the truth.

00:21:50.268 --> 00:21:51.895 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
What truth?

00:21:51.978 --> 00:21:54.564 position:50% align:center
Somebody in the Special Fire
Force should already know

00:21:54.647 --> 00:21:56.858 position:50% align:center
what's causing the
Infernals to appear.

00:21:56.941 --> 00:22:01.154 position:50% align:center
If I can force them to reveal
it, I'll save some lives.

00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:19.756 position:50% align:center
With your leave, sir, I'd be
honored to assist with that.

00:22:24.803 --> 00:22:26.471 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Shinra.

00:22:26.554 --> 00:22:29.849 position:50% align:center
I'm proud to call you a
member of Company 8.
