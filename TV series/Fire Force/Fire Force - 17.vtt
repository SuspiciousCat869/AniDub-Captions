00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:30.572 position:50% align:center
[IRIS] Raffles saw at once
that the Unsullied Flame

00:00:30.655 --> 00:00:32.490 position:50% align:center
was a gift from the great Sol.

00:00:32.574 --> 00:00:34.993 position:50% align:center
He resolved to harness
its power with technology

00:00:35.076 --> 00:00:38.496 position:50% align:center
and created Amaterasu.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.332 position:50% align:center
By the light of
Amaterasu's sacred flame,

00:00:41.416 --> 00:00:43.460 position:50% align:center
the people began to rebuild.

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:47.881 position:50% align:center
With its power, they established
a new state in the Far East.

00:01:09.444 --> 00:01:10.445 position:50% align:center
[IRIS]
Stop it!

00:01:10.528 --> 00:01:12.113 position:50% align:center
That might seem
worthless to you,

00:01:12.197 --> 00:01:13.740 position:50% align:center
but to Vulcan, it's
a precious memory

00:01:13.823 --> 00:01:15.867 position:50% align:center
that he shared with his family.

00:01:17.535 --> 00:01:19.746 position:50% align:center
Please just leave him alone!

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:34.344 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Hm?

00:01:34.427 --> 00:01:36.513 position:50% align:center
Heard a commotion over
the wire I planted on Iris,

00:01:36.596 --> 00:01:38.264 position:50% align:center
so I thought I'd come by.

00:01:38.348 --> 00:01:41.434 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Captain Hibana,
you've gotta help!

00:01:42.644 --> 00:01:45.146 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Owie!

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.815 position:50% align:center
Thanks a bunch!
Now get me outta this thing!

00:01:46.898 --> 00:01:49.651 position:50% align:center
I was planning to.
Relax a moment.

00:01:49.734 --> 00:01:53.154 position:50% align:center
I can't! Everyone at the
workshop is in danger right now.

00:01:53.238 --> 00:01:55.824 position:50% align:center
Though I could always just
take you home as you are.

00:01:55.907 --> 00:01:57.158 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Huh?

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:07.711 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA sighs]

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:09.963 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA]
I regret my choice already.

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:14.843 position:50% align:center
[MIRAGE]
Another one?

00:02:14.926 --> 00:02:16.177 position:50% align:center
Arthur! What's happening?

00:02:16.261 --> 00:02:19.055 position:50% align:center
Giovanni's in the workshop!
Go take him out!

00:02:34.446 --> 00:02:36.573 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI laughs]

00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:38.324 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
I should've guessed.

00:02:38.408 --> 00:02:41.703 position:50% align:center
You would hide it in
some piece of junk.

00:02:41.786 --> 00:02:46.708 position:50% align:center
With this secured, all that's
left is to dispose of you.

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:48.960 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
Hm?

00:02:55.342 --> 00:02:58.970 position:50% align:center
That's why I'm called Smash-
the-Doctor's-Creepy-Nose-In Man!

00:02:59.054 --> 00:03:02.182 position:50% align:center
Get away from my
company's new engineer.

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:29.709 position:50% align:center
<i>take what you got and leave now</i>

00:03:29.793 --> 00:03:31.878 position:50% align:center

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:37.676 position:50% align:center

00:03:43.598 --> 00:03:47.560 position:50% align:center
<i>you're crooked desire</i>
<i>left us in disarray</i>

00:03:47.644 --> 00:03:51.523 position:50% align:center

<i>at the point of no return</i>

00:03:51.606 --> 00:03:55.610 position:50% align:center

<i>you're gonna watch it burn</i>

00:03:55.694 --> 00:03:59.239 position:50% align:center

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:22.971 position:50% align:center
<i>MAYDAY</i>

00:04:23.054 --> 00:04:26.975 position:50% align:center
<i>MAYDAY</i>

00:04:27.058 --> 00:04:30.687 position:50% align:center
<i>MAYDAY</i>

00:04:33.982 --> 00:04:36.151 position:50% align:center
[groaning]

00:04:36.234 --> 00:04:37.944 position:50% align:center
Shinra, you're here!

00:04:42.615 --> 00:04:45.285 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
You're with them? But why?

00:04:47.203 --> 00:04:49.706 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
You okay, Vulcan? Can you move?

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:51.499 position:50% align:center
Feel like I'm gonna
need a minute.

00:04:51.583 --> 00:04:54.169 position:50% align:center
Took a beating and
a blast to the chest.

00:04:56.588 --> 00:04:58.965 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
Shinra Kusakabe.

00:04:59.049 --> 00:05:02.510 position:50% align:center
How'd you escape
your restraints?

00:05:02.594 --> 00:05:04.095 position:50% align:center
No matter.

00:05:04.179 --> 00:05:08.224 position:50% align:center
I can capture you again once
I've dealt with these pests.

00:05:08.308 --> 00:05:11.269 position:50% align:center
Thought you guys weren't
supposed to let anyone in there.

00:05:14.814 --> 00:05:17.942 position:50% align:center
Damn it. So annoying.

00:05:18.026 --> 00:05:19.194 position:50% align:center
[MIRAGE]
My shimmers?

00:05:19.277 --> 00:05:21.654 position:50% align:center
I'm sure they are,
since unlike your comrade,

00:05:21.738 --> 00:05:25.325 position:50% align:center
you compulsively parry every
attack that's thrown at you.

00:05:25.408 --> 00:05:28.036 position:50% align:center
You've fallen for
my every feint.

00:05:30.747 --> 00:05:33.083 position:50% align:center
Warm air becomes
light and rises,

00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:35.502 position:50% align:center
whilst cold air
does the opposite.

00:05:35.585 --> 00:05:36.711 position:50% align:center
You make your illusions

00:05:36.795 --> 00:05:39.631 position:50% align:center
by manipulating differences
in air density.

00:05:39.714 --> 00:05:41.174 position:50% align:center
So if I supply enough heat

00:05:41.257 --> 00:05:43.760 position:50% align:center
to make those minute
differences irrelevant,

00:05:43.843 --> 00:05:46.012 position:50% align:center
your "shimmers" fade away.

00:05:46.096 --> 00:05:47.722 position:50% align:center
You have no chance.

00:05:47.806 --> 00:05:50.225 position:50% align:center
Now, let's end this.

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.104 position:50% align:center
Take it easy. I'm on your side!

00:05:54.187 --> 00:05:56.564 position:50% align:center
All gravel's the same to me.

00:05:58.024 --> 00:05:59.984 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA]
Except for Shinra.

00:06:02.028 --> 00:06:04.781 position:50% align:center
[LISA]
Rise, Fishing Fire!

00:06:04.864 --> 00:06:07.200 position:50% align:center
Wrap him up and
hold him in place!

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:09.369 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
What is this?

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.248 position:50% align:center
My flames are
magnetically charged.

00:06:13.331 --> 00:06:15.875 position:50% align:center
They sense the magnetic
fields around living things,

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:17.669 position:50% align:center
and latch onto them.

00:06:25.301 --> 00:06:26.636 position:50% align:center
They caught him.

00:06:29.055 --> 00:06:32.225 position:50% align:center
Sister! Hit the buttons
on that wall!

00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:35.103 position:50% align:center
[IRIS]
<i>Látom.</i>

00:06:35.186 --> 00:06:37.147 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
<i>Látom.</i>

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:38.231 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
Hm?

00:06:40.025 --> 00:06:43.194 position:50% align:center
You're doin' great, Sister!
Just keep it up, okay?

00:06:43.278 --> 00:06:45.321 position:50% align:center
<i>Látom</i> !

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:47.032 position:50% align:center
[ANIMALS]
<i>Látom</i> !

00:06:47.115 --> 00:06:48.742 position:50% align:center
<i>Látom</i> ?

00:06:48.825 --> 00:06:50.910 position:50% align:center
[IRIS]
<i>Látom</i> ! <i>Látom</i> !

00:06:50.994 --> 00:06:53.955 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] Everything you've
created is pointless.

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.084 position:50% align:center
[IRIS] <i>Látom</i> ! <i>Látom</i> !<i>Látom</i> !
<i>Látom</i> ! <i>Látom</i> ! <i>Látom</i> !

00:06:58.168 --> 00:06:59.836 position:50% align:center
[ANIMALS]
<i>Látom</i> !

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:02.339 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
If this keeps up, I'll pass out.

00:07:04.549 --> 00:07:07.177 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA] Think I'll melt
this gravel into asphalt.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.805 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:11.890 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:07:19.606 --> 00:07:23.360 position:50% align:center
Wait a sec. Is the
Sister at it again?

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:31.576 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:37.749 position:50% align:center
Those machines may be tiny,

00:07:37.832 --> 00:07:40.001 position:50% align:center
but each has its
own magnetic field.

00:07:40.085 --> 00:07:41.711 position:50% align:center
I figured if we release
enough of 'em,

00:07:41.795 --> 00:07:43.588 position:50% align:center
we could disrupt the
magnetic homing system

00:07:43.672 --> 00:07:45.757 position:50% align:center
your flames use
to target humans.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.009 position:50% align:center
And it looks like I was right.

00:07:58.311 --> 00:08:00.897 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] He has the edge
in close quarters.

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:03.900 position:50% align:center
I can't maneuver as
well in all this gear.

00:08:03.983 --> 00:08:06.152 position:50% align:center
Your report lead me to
believe that the enemy

00:08:06.236 --> 00:08:08.238 position:50% align:center
had been subdued here.

00:08:11.366 --> 00:08:12.575 position:50% align:center
Again?

00:08:21.835 --> 00:08:25.880 position:50% align:center
Tell me, are you the person
I just linked with?

00:08:50.447 --> 00:08:51.948 position:50% align:center
That's gotta be you, right?

00:08:52.032 --> 00:08:53.283 position:50% align:center
You're Sho!

00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:56.244 position:50% align:center
Hey, listen. I think that
we might be brothers.

00:08:56.327 --> 00:08:58.955 position:50% align:center
To be honest,
I'm pretty sure of it.

00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:00.707 position:50% align:center
I'm Shinra, your big brother.

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:02.417 position:50% align:center
It's so good to see you!

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:05.211 position:50% align:center
It's your belief that
we share blood?

00:09:07.339 --> 00:09:09.883 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Aww! You're crazy adorable, too!

00:09:09.966 --> 00:09:12.177 position:50% align:center
I guess good looks
must run in the family!

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.137 position:50% align:center
You're gonna be a hit
at school, bro!

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.598 position:50% align:center
Ya look like a friggin' angel!

00:09:19.434 --> 00:09:23.772 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] I can finally make
good on my promise now, Mom.

00:09:23.855 --> 00:09:25.398 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna protect you.

00:09:25.482 --> 00:09:27.525 position:50% align:center
No matter what happens next.

00:09:27.609 --> 00:09:30.153 position:50% align:center
I'll always be in
your corner, 'kay?

00:09:34.115 --> 00:09:36.868 position:50% align:center
[SHO]
I see now.

00:09:36.951 --> 00:09:39.871 position:50% align:center
The Evangelist said
I'd know him on sight.

00:09:39.954 --> 00:09:41.581 position:50% align:center
And so I do.

00:09:41.664 --> 00:09:45.251 position:50% align:center
This is my brother. It's true.

00:09:47.295 --> 00:09:50.632 position:50% align:center
[SHO] This feeling
is hard to describe.

00:09:50.715 --> 00:09:54.427 position:50% align:center
The only word that comes
to mind is disgust.

00:09:58.473 --> 00:09:59.891 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
When did he--?

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:04.479 position:50% align:center
As a wielder of
the Adolla Burst,

00:10:04.562 --> 00:10:06.773 position:50% align:center
you need to come with us now.

00:10:08.566 --> 00:10:09.984 position:50% align:center
Shinra!

00:10:15.073 --> 00:10:17.283 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR groans]

00:10:17.367 --> 00:10:19.994 position:50% align:center
Quite impressive.
He actually reacted.

00:10:20.078 --> 00:10:21.371 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Arthur!

00:10:29.796 --> 00:10:32.549 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] How is he able
to move like that?

00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:35.593 position:50% align:center
Why can't I see what he's doing?

00:10:35.677 --> 00:10:37.512 position:50% align:center
I don't get it.

00:10:45.979 --> 00:10:48.732 position:50% align:center
[SHO] Bring the one with the
Adolla Burst back with us.

00:10:48.815 --> 00:10:51.151 position:50% align:center
The rest should be disposed of.

00:10:51.234 --> 00:10:52.444 position:50% align:center
[FLAIL, MIRAGE]
Yes, sir.

00:10:52.527 --> 00:10:54.279 position:50% align:center
Did you find it?

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:04.581 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] The key to
Amaterasu is ours now.

00:11:12.797 --> 00:11:14.841 position:50% align:center
Shinra! Get in!

00:11:20.847 --> 00:11:22.849 position:50% align:center
Still in one piece, I see.

00:11:22.932 --> 00:11:24.642 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
When did you get here?

00:11:38.448 --> 00:11:40.283 position:50% align:center
It's okay! C'mon!

00:11:40.367 --> 00:11:41.659 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:07.727 --> 00:12:09.187 position:50% align:center
Whoa there, skippy.

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:11.064 position:50% align:center
How'd ya get there so quick?

00:12:11.147 --> 00:12:12.440 position:50% align:center
Nice try.

00:12:12.524 --> 00:12:15.735 position:50% align:center
The wielder of the Adolla Burst
won't escape my grasp.

00:12:15.819 --> 00:12:17.987 position:50% align:center
[JOKER]
Sorry, squirt.

00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:20.657 position:50% align:center
But I can't let you
have him yet.

00:12:25.662 --> 00:12:26.788 position:50% align:center
[JOKER chuckles]

00:12:29.374 --> 00:12:32.585 position:50% align:center
[JOKER]
The hero's arrived.

00:12:32.669 --> 00:12:36.214 position:50% align:center
Listen! I'll come back
for you, Sho! I promise!

00:12:38.049 --> 00:12:40.260 position:50% align:center
So you're the man
known as Joker.

00:12:40.343 --> 00:12:44.556 position:50% align:center
Ah. It seems my
reputation precedes me.

00:12:53.148 --> 00:12:56.776 position:50% align:center
[JOKER] Whoo! That's enough
to make even me nervous.

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:59.946 position:50% align:center
Stop interfering in our affairs.

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:02.365 position:50% align:center
I don't intend to let you
or the Fire Force

00:13:02.449 --> 00:13:05.076 position:50% align:center
go around doin' as you please.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.747 position:50% align:center
Think they've gained
enough distance.

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:12.625 position:50% align:center
So there's no point
in staying here.

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:20.633 position:50% align:center
[SHO] He doesn't even
have an Adolla Link.

00:13:22.052 --> 00:13:23.595 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:13:24.721 --> 00:13:26.765 position:50% align:center
What a monster.

00:13:46.242 --> 00:13:47.494 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Hey, Captain Obi.

00:13:47.577 --> 00:13:50.330 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir. We got the
kid to the hospital.

00:13:50.413 --> 00:13:52.207 position:50% align:center
Yeah, him and Arthur.

00:13:56.711 --> 00:13:58.171 position:50% align:center
The workshop's in shambles.

00:13:58.254 --> 00:14:00.590 position:50% align:center
It was definitely
the White-Clad.

00:14:00.674 --> 00:14:03.677 position:50% align:center
And Doctor Giovanni?
He's one of them.

00:14:05.804 --> 00:14:09.891 position:50% align:center
I also met a kid who
I think is my brother.

00:14:09.974 --> 00:14:11.351 position:50% align:center
Vulcan's all right.

00:14:11.434 --> 00:14:14.896 position:50% align:center
That said, the White-Clad
might come after him again.

00:14:14.979 --> 00:14:16.981 position:50% align:center
We'll stay close just in case.

00:14:17.065 --> 00:14:19.567 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I think that might
be for the best, sir.

00:14:19.651 --> 00:14:21.486 position:50% align:center
We'll wait for you to get here.

00:14:29.994 --> 00:14:31.955 position:50% align:center
So, uh, Vulcan.

00:14:32.038 --> 00:14:35.041 position:50% align:center
Why don't you come to
the 8th? Just as a guest.

00:14:35.125 --> 00:14:36.960 position:50% align:center
Think you'd be safer there.

00:14:38.378 --> 00:14:41.923 position:50% align:center
Okay. I'll do that.

00:14:42.007 --> 00:14:43.633 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Shinra.

00:14:48.722 --> 00:14:51.766 position:50% align:center
This isn't how I wanted
things to pan out at all.

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:53.309 position:50% align:center
Thought we'd charm you.

00:14:53.393 --> 00:14:56.688 position:50% align:center
Convince you that the 8th
was the place to be.

00:14:56.771 --> 00:14:57.981 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry.

00:14:58.064 --> 00:15:00.191 position:50% align:center
We all fought as
hard as we could,

00:15:00.275 --> 00:15:02.444 position:50% align:center
but we couldn't protect you...

00:15:02.527 --> 00:15:04.487 position:50% align:center
...or your family.

00:15:06.865 --> 00:15:10.035 position:50% align:center
You don't have anything
to apologize for.

00:15:10.118 --> 00:15:13.121 position:50% align:center
You warned me that danger
was heading my way,

00:15:13.204 --> 00:15:15.832 position:50% align:center
and I made the
choice not to listen.

00:15:17.792 --> 00:15:19.544 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
I know Yu's just a kid,

00:15:19.627 --> 00:15:22.297 position:50% align:center
but he's a lot tougher
than he looks.

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:24.466 position:50% align:center
And Lisa isn't really--

00:15:27.385 --> 00:15:30.138 position:50% align:center
There ain't a thing in this
world that can't be fixed.

00:15:30.221 --> 00:15:33.933 position:50% align:center
So Lisa's gonna come around.
And Yu's gonna heal up.

00:15:34.017 --> 00:15:38.146 position:50% align:center
Once I've got them, it's
back to fixing this world.

00:15:38.229 --> 00:15:39.606 position:50% align:center
What about you?

00:15:39.689 --> 00:15:41.733 position:50% align:center
Seeing your brother
like that must've hurt.

00:15:41.816 --> 00:15:44.110 position:50% align:center
You don't need to
worry about me.

00:15:44.194 --> 00:15:47.822 position:50% align:center
I know I'm not the only
person who's got it bad.

00:15:47.906 --> 00:15:51.910 position:50% align:center
It's the world we live in.
Same boat, n' all that.

00:15:54.412 --> 00:15:57.499 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] That's true.
We're in this together.

00:15:57.582 --> 00:16:00.251 position:50% align:center
So, hey, when you start
working towards your dream,

00:16:00.335 --> 00:16:02.295 position:50% align:center
I'll be glad to help out.

00:16:02.379 --> 00:16:03.838 position:50% align:center
Count on it.

00:16:04.881 --> 00:16:06.800 position:50% align:center
I 'preciate that.

00:16:11.638 --> 00:16:14.099 position:50% align:center
Tell me, how did you
know to show up

00:16:14.182 --> 00:16:16.267 position:50% align:center
just in time to save the day?

00:16:16.351 --> 00:16:17.686 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Got lucky?

00:16:17.769 --> 00:16:19.270 position:50% align:center
They took so long to get back

00:16:19.354 --> 00:16:21.564 position:50% align:center
I figured I'd go
and check on 'em.

00:16:23.858 --> 00:16:25.944 position:50% align:center
Or maybe it's because
you were the one

00:16:26.027 --> 00:16:28.613 position:50% align:center
who led the White-Clad out
there in the first place.

00:16:28.697 --> 00:16:31.491 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
That's ridiculous. So not true.

00:16:31.574 --> 00:16:33.284 position:50% align:center
Why would I bring them there

00:16:33.368 --> 00:16:35.453 position:50% align:center
just to help you guys
get away from them?

00:16:38.373 --> 00:16:39.791 position:50% align:center
Step one toe out of line

00:16:39.874 --> 00:16:43.378 position:50% align:center
and I will crush you until
you turn from gravel to sand.

00:16:47.465 --> 00:16:50.593 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Arthur's wounds weren't
nearly as bad as I thought,

00:16:50.677 --> 00:16:52.846 position:50% align:center
but there's always next time.

00:16:52.929 --> 00:16:56.391 position:50% align:center
It wasn't long before Yu was
out of the woods as well.

00:16:56.474 --> 00:16:58.309 position:50% align:center
At Captain Obi's invitation,

00:16:58.393 --> 00:17:02.105 position:50% align:center
Vulcan ended up taking
refuge at Company 8.

00:17:08.153 --> 00:17:11.072 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Sho really is
serving the Evangelist.

00:17:11.156 --> 00:17:13.867 position:50% align:center
But I'll help him come around.

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:17.912 position:50% align:center
No matter what it takes,
I will keep my promise.

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:22.876 position:50% align:center
[MAKI]
I'm so sorry about them!

00:17:24.085 --> 00:17:25.879 position:50% align:center
Thought I'd open with
that in case our rookies

00:17:25.962 --> 00:17:27.839 position:50% align:center
were disrespectful towards you.

00:17:27.922 --> 00:17:29.341 position:50% align:center
They're astoundingly stupid.

00:17:29.424 --> 00:17:30.550 position:50% align:center
We were polite.

00:17:30.633 --> 00:17:32.135 position:50% align:center
Way polite.

00:17:32.218 --> 00:17:35.305 position:50% align:center
Their manners were just fine.
If anyone was rude, it was me.

00:17:35.388 --> 00:17:37.724 position:50% align:center
Food's on the table.
Come and get it.

00:17:37.807 --> 00:17:40.060 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Who made it? Was it you?

00:17:40.143 --> 00:17:41.978 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI] No, the lieutenant
cooked it himself

00:17:42.062 --> 00:17:43.480 position:50% align:center
since we had a guest coming.

00:17:43.563 --> 00:17:45.440 position:50% align:center
Whoa, for real? Hell yeah.

00:17:45.523 --> 00:17:47.317 position:50% align:center
Hey, what's that
supposed to mean?!

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:48.651 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
I feel like you can guess.

00:17:48.735 --> 00:17:50.904 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI] What're you,
scared to say it yourself?

00:17:55.617 --> 00:17:58.244 position:50% align:center
Wow. This looks
amazing. Nice work!

00:17:58.328 --> 00:18:00.121 position:50% align:center
I'm friggin' starving.

00:18:02.165 --> 00:18:04.459 position:50% align:center
Ugh! Hey, what's the big idea?

00:18:04.542 --> 00:18:06.211 position:50% align:center
That was punishment
for making me defend

00:18:06.294 --> 00:18:07.962 position:50% align:center
the workshop by myself.

00:18:08.046 --> 00:18:09.047 position:50% align:center
You're kidding me.

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:11.174 position:50% align:center
I was kinda busy getting
ambushed, okay?

00:18:11.257 --> 00:18:12.592 position:50% align:center
Well, don't let that happen!

00:18:12.676 --> 00:18:14.803 position:50% align:center
Don't act like everything
went perfect on your end!

00:18:14.886 --> 00:18:15.929 position:50% align:center
Huh? I'll have you know...

00:18:16.012 --> 00:18:18.390 position:50% align:center
Sorry, those two
can get pretty loud.

00:18:18.473 --> 00:18:21.142 position:50% align:center
Oh, I grew up in
a machine shop--

00:18:21.226 --> 00:18:23.395 position:50% align:center
noise is somethin' I'm used to.

00:18:23.478 --> 00:18:25.480 position:50% align:center
Would you two idiots
lock it down?

00:18:25.563 --> 00:18:27.482 position:50% align:center
Play nice for our guest.

00:18:27.565 --> 00:18:28.400 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR, SHINRA]
Huh?

00:18:28.483 --> 00:18:30.110 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Keep your distance.

00:18:30.193 --> 00:18:32.737 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
I've plundered enough.

00:18:32.821 --> 00:18:34.155 position:50% align:center
Man, that's good!

00:18:34.239 --> 00:18:35.907 position:50% align:center
When the lieutenant's
on dinner duty,

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:38.201 position:50% align:center
ya know you're in for a treat.

00:18:38.284 --> 00:18:41.329 position:50% align:center
I can never stop
myself from overeating.

00:18:44.249 --> 00:18:46.584 position:50% align:center
[MAKI] It's awful.
He's showing us all up.

00:18:46.668 --> 00:18:47.836 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
And he guards those recipes

00:18:47.919 --> 00:18:50.422 position:50% align:center
like a stingy old granny.

00:18:50.505 --> 00:18:54.175 position:50% align:center
Did you get enough? We've
got plenty left over still.

00:19:00.432 --> 00:19:02.767 position:50% align:center
Is it always like this here?

00:19:02.851 --> 00:19:04.352 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Pretty much.

00:19:04.436 --> 00:19:07.272 position:50% align:center
Well, Tamaki's lucky lecher lure
isn't acting up at the moment,

00:19:07.355 --> 00:19:10.233 position:50% align:center
so I guess it's a little
bit better than usual.

00:19:10.316 --> 00:19:13.153 position:50% align:center
Her... lucky-what lure?

00:19:13.236 --> 00:19:15.947 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI gasps, cries]

00:19:16.031 --> 00:19:20.243 position:50% align:center
You know, this really isn't
what I was expecting.

00:19:20.326 --> 00:19:22.203 position:50% align:center
Listen, Vulcan.

00:19:22.287 --> 00:19:24.873 position:50% align:center
Shinra might've told
you this already,

00:19:24.956 --> 00:19:27.584 position:50% align:center
but our mission at the 8th
is to save this planet

00:19:27.667 --> 00:19:29.627 position:50% align:center
and the people on it.

00:19:29.711 --> 00:19:32.339 position:50% align:center
I know your family never
cared for the Fire Force,

00:19:32.422 --> 00:19:35.300 position:50% align:center
and I understand why.

00:19:35.383 --> 00:19:38.219 position:50% align:center
But there's a place for
you here if you want it.

00:19:40.764 --> 00:19:42.807 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
That's a standing offer.

00:19:42.891 --> 00:19:44.851 position:50% align:center
And even if you
decide to decline it,

00:19:44.934 --> 00:19:47.771 position:50% align:center
we'll still keep you
and yours safe.

00:19:47.854 --> 00:19:51.566 position:50% align:center
We only want you to take this
job if it's what you want.

00:20:03.119 --> 00:20:06.748 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR] Why'd Vulcan wanna
come back to the workshop?

00:20:06.831 --> 00:20:08.792 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] He said he needed
to settle some things.

00:20:08.875 --> 00:20:11.503 position:50% align:center
Might be picking up stuff, too.

00:20:11.586 --> 00:20:12.671 position:50% align:center
It would be pretty awesome

00:20:12.754 --> 00:20:16.174 position:50% align:center
if he did decide to
become our engineer.

00:20:16.257 --> 00:20:17.926 position:50% align:center
It really would.

00:20:27.102 --> 00:20:32.232 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN] Pop. Granddad.
Here's your usual sodas.

00:20:32.315 --> 00:20:34.359 position:50% align:center
Dunno if you can see me
from where you are,

00:20:34.442 --> 00:20:37.987 position:50% align:center
but the Fire Force
is taking me in.

00:20:38.071 --> 00:20:39.531 position:50% align:center
I'm not proud of it.

00:20:39.614 --> 00:20:42.158 position:50% align:center
I know they're all
tied to Haijima.

00:20:44.869 --> 00:20:48.331 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
So... am I disowned?

00:20:48.415 --> 00:20:50.625 position:50% align:center
We swore as a family
we'd never help them,

00:20:50.709 --> 00:20:53.670 position:50% align:center
but so far, it's them
that helped me.

00:20:53.753 --> 00:20:57.632 position:50% align:center
Maybe our family was cursed
for building Amaterasu.

00:20:57.716 --> 00:20:59.551 position:50% align:center
It seems like anything
and everything

00:20:59.634 --> 00:21:02.262 position:50% align:center
that's precious
to me gets broken.

00:21:06.725 --> 00:21:09.060 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
Somehow, someway,

00:21:09.144 --> 00:21:11.813 position:50% align:center
I have to build something
that's too strong to break.

00:21:11.896 --> 00:21:15.900 position:50% align:center
I have to fix this world
so life can thrive in it.

00:21:15.984 --> 00:21:18.236 position:50% align:center
I thought I could do
it all on my own...

00:21:19.863 --> 00:21:22.198 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
But then I met Lisa and Yu.

00:21:22.282 --> 00:21:23.908 position:50% align:center
And now this guy
from the Fire Force

00:21:23.992 --> 00:21:25.952 position:50% align:center
who says he wants to help.

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:31.374 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, Granddad, 'n Pop.

00:21:31.458 --> 00:21:34.461 position:50% align:center
Gave my word,
but I'm breakin' it.

00:23:13.309 --> 00:23:14.519 position:50% align:center
Time to clean.

00:23:14.602 --> 00:23:16.938 position:50% align:center
Let's make this dump look good!

00:23:17.022 --> 00:23:19.357 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] You clean on that side;
I'll clean on this one.

00:23:19.441 --> 00:23:20.734 position:50% align:center
Do not come anywhere near me.

00:23:20.817 --> 00:23:23.570 position:50% align:center
If anyone needs to keep
their distance, it's you!

00:23:26.656 --> 00:23:28.033 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
What is that?

00:23:28.116 --> 00:23:29.784 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN] The captain told me
I could move stuff around

00:23:29.868 --> 00:23:34.122 position:50% align:center
however I want if it makes
the place easier to work in.

00:23:34.205 --> 00:23:37.000 position:50% align:center
And I work best in a
place that has style.

00:23:37.083 --> 00:23:40.295 position:50% align:center
Ooh, that doesn't look half bad.

00:23:40.378 --> 00:23:42.922 position:50% align:center
We're not really gonna leave
that up there, are we?

00:23:43.006 --> 00:23:45.800 position:50% align:center
Company 8 is a ragtag
band of misfits even now,

00:23:45.884 --> 00:23:47.844 position:50% align:center
so this kinda thing suits us.

00:23:47.927 --> 00:23:49.804 position:50% align:center
Plus, it's totally rock'n'roll.

00:23:49.888 --> 00:23:50.972 position:50% align:center

00:23:51.056 --> 00:23:53.600 position:50% align:center
C'mon, Devil, flash your
horns. Let's rock.

00:23:53.683 --> 00:23:56.770 position:50% align:center
Please stop calling me
a devil, sir. I'm a hero.

00:23:56.853 --> 00:23:57.979 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
Heh.

00:23:58.063 --> 00:24:00.565 position:50% align:center
[OBI] Yeah, but devils
are a lot more rockin'.

00:24:00.648 --> 00:24:02.317 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA groans]

00:24:06.321 --> 00:24:07.655 position:50% align:center
