00:00:12.971 --> 00:00:15.306 position:50% align:center
This is the incident report
that seems most likely

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.600 position:50% align:center
to be connected to these
White-Clad attacks.

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:20.061 position:50% align:center
That's right.
It's from our first job.

00:00:20.145 --> 00:00:23.148 position:50% align:center
Sister Iris and Maki had only
just joined up with the 8th.

00:00:23.231 --> 00:00:24.566 position:50% align:center
We were all new.

00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:26.359 position:50% align:center
That kinda makes me curious.

00:00:26.443 --> 00:00:28.194 position:50% align:center
How'd the 8th start
in the first place?

00:00:28.278 --> 00:00:30.572 position:50% align:center
Good question--I never
got around to asking about

00:00:30.655 --> 00:00:33.158 position:50% align:center
what things were
like before I joined.

00:00:33.241 --> 00:00:35.201 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Hmm.

00:00:35.285 --> 00:00:36.619 position:50% align:center
It's a long story.

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:38.371 position:50% align:center
But it relates to the
heart of Company 8,

00:00:38.455 --> 00:00:40.290 position:50% align:center
so it's worth telling.

00:00:40.373 --> 00:00:42.959 position:50% align:center
Lieutenant, tell 'em
how we got started.

00:00:43.043 --> 00:00:44.169 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA]
Hm?

00:00:44.252 --> 00:00:46.463 position:50% align:center
[OBI] You're the better
talker by far, so...

00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:48.256 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's an order.

00:02:45.874 --> 00:02:47.167 position:50% align:center
It's crazy.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.920 position:50% align:center
The reports of Infernal
breakouts just keep coming.

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:52.088 position:50% align:center
Makes me wonder.

00:02:52.172 --> 00:02:54.174 position:50% align:center
Maybe instead of
investigating criminals,

00:02:54.257 --> 00:02:56.301 position:50% align:center
we could be helping
out with all that.

00:02:56.384 --> 00:02:59.429 position:50% align:center
Infernals are the Special
Fire Force's jurisdiction.

00:02:59.512 --> 00:03:01.181 position:50% align:center
Don't get any ideas.

00:03:01.264 --> 00:03:02.891 position:50% align:center
Sergeant Hinawa!

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:06.519 position:50% align:center
[MAKI]
I'll be going now, sir.

00:03:09.356 --> 00:03:14.069 position:50% align:center
Haven't seen her around before.
She who I think?

00:03:14.152 --> 00:03:18.907 position:50% align:center
Lieutenant General Oze's kid.
That was Private Maki Oze.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.160 position:50% align:center
[TOJO] She's so thin.
Is she doin' okay?

00:03:22.243 --> 00:03:24.621 position:50% align:center
Oze works twice as
hard as her peers,

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:27.248 position:50% align:center
and always does more than
she's asked to in training.

00:03:27.332 --> 00:03:30.251 position:50% align:center
At this rate, she'll flesh out
those muscles in no time.

00:03:30.335 --> 00:03:32.712 position:50% align:center
That's impressive for
a general's daughter.

00:03:32.796 --> 00:03:34.130 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but she's
still her father's

00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:37.384 position:50% align:center
sheltered little princess,
and he got her in.

00:03:37.467 --> 00:03:40.178 position:50% align:center
She's far too soft-hearted
for this line of work.

00:03:40.261 --> 00:03:43.264 position:50% align:center
All the effort she's putting
in will amount to nothing.

00:03:43.348 --> 00:03:45.308 position:50% align:center
Why're you always so critical?

00:03:45.392 --> 00:03:48.144 position:50% align:center
If she's giving this her all,
then you should help her.

00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:50.605 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA] Wasted effort
doesn't count as effort.

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:52.399 position:50% align:center
She may as well be slacking.

00:03:52.482 --> 00:03:56.111 position:50% align:center
Oh, c'mon. She's a nice kid
who's doin' her best, okay?

00:03:56.194 --> 00:03:57.987 position:50% align:center
You always go easy
on these rookies.

00:03:58.071 --> 00:03:59.155 position:50% align:center
[thud]

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.369 position:50% align:center
Standard USP nine-millimeter.

00:04:04.452 --> 00:04:06.121 position:50% align:center
Except I got it baptized.

00:04:06.204 --> 00:04:08.206 position:50% align:center
Thought I'd take a page
from the Fire Force.

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:10.291 position:50% align:center
Another case of wasted effort.

00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:11.501 position:50% align:center
Is it though?

00:04:11.584 --> 00:04:14.087 position:50% align:center
Between a baptized gun
and one that wasn't,

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.797 position:50% align:center
which would you want
to shoot you?

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.091 position:50% align:center
Probably the baptized
gun, right?

00:04:18.174 --> 00:04:19.467 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA]
Hm?

00:04:19.551 --> 00:04:22.345 position:50% align:center
How about it, Hinawa?
Go visit the church.

00:04:22.429 --> 00:04:25.432 position:50% align:center
Get your gun baptized just
to see if it feels different.

00:04:25.515 --> 00:04:26.933 position:50% align:center
I've got a hunch that
your point of view

00:04:27.017 --> 00:04:29.269 position:50% align:center
might change a little bit.

00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:31.730 position:50% align:center
Well, I don't believe in
your so-called "sun god."

00:04:31.813 --> 00:04:35.400 position:50% align:center
No ritual can alter what happens
when a gun is discharged.

00:04:35.483 --> 00:04:37.819 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I thought you'd
say something like that.

00:04:37.902 --> 00:04:39.904 position:50% align:center
You're the same as ever.

00:04:42.657 --> 00:04:44.909 position:50% align:center
You're a truly
kind person, Tojo.

00:04:44.993 --> 00:04:46.911 position:50% align:center
Why stick with someone like me?

00:04:46.995 --> 00:04:48.246 position:50% align:center
Honestly, man?

00:04:48.329 --> 00:04:49.622 position:50% align:center
It's because you
aren't anywhere near

00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:51.875 position:50% align:center
as cold-hearted as you think.

00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:55.378 position:50% align:center
You just bussed my tray with
yours without a second thought.

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:23.156 position:50% align:center
[TOJO screaming]

00:05:23.239 --> 00:05:24.532 position:50% align:center
Tojo.

00:05:24.616 --> 00:05:27.285 position:50% align:center
I'm turning, Hina. Shoot me!

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:30.747 position:50% align:center
Hurry up. Please!
While I'm still conscious!

00:05:31.998 --> 00:05:36.836 position:50% align:center
[TOJO]
You have to shoot me! Shoot!

00:05:44.135 --> 00:05:46.805 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:05:48.098 --> 00:05:49.599 position:50% align:center
Which would you want
to shoot you?

00:05:49.683 --> 00:05:52.435 position:50% align:center
Probably the baptized
gun, right?

00:05:56.606 --> 00:05:57.482 position:50% align:center
[thud]

00:05:57.565 --> 00:05:58.942 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA gasps]

00:05:59.025 --> 00:06:00.068 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:10.120 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA]
Why couldn't I do it?

00:06:10.203 --> 00:06:12.122 position:50% align:center
Even when he begged?

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.799 position:50% align:center
[INVENTORY KEEPER A]
You're here early, Sergeant.

00:06:22.882 --> 00:06:24.259 position:50% align:center
Just stamped your papers.

00:06:24.342 --> 00:06:28.054 position:50% align:center
The late lieutenant's gun
is now yours, as requested.

00:06:28.138 --> 00:06:30.181 position:50% align:center
Thanks, I appreciate it.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.123 position:50% align:center
[FIREFIGHTER A] The Blue
Stripes have arrived!

00:06:55.206 --> 00:06:57.042 position:50% align:center
We'll help the civilians
and contain the fire

00:06:57.125 --> 00:06:59.419 position:50% align:center
while they put the
Infernals to rest.

00:06:59.502 --> 00:07:00.837 position:50% align:center
Reporting in!

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.423 position:50% align:center
I've command of on-scene
fire suppression personnel.

00:07:03.506 --> 00:07:05.300 position:50% align:center
Akitaru Obi.

00:07:05.383 --> 00:07:08.178 position:50% align:center
So I've been told that there
were two Infernals here.

00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:09.054 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Yes.

00:07:09.137 --> 00:07:10.305 position:50% align:center
There are two,

00:07:10.388 --> 00:07:12.140 position:50% align:center
but they're in different
locations at the moment.

00:07:12.223 --> 00:07:13.433 position:50% align:center
The more belligerent one

00:07:13.516 --> 00:07:15.935 position:50% align:center
is currently running
around inside our cordon.

00:07:16.019 --> 00:07:17.979 position:50% align:center
The other one's
been pretty docile.

00:07:18.063 --> 00:07:20.357 position:50% align:center
It's just sitting
inside a store.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.192 position:50% align:center
I'll pass on that second one.

00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:24.736 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's not gonna
net us many points.

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:26.112 position:50% align:center
Wait, "points"?

00:07:26.196 --> 00:07:27.655 position:50% align:center
Thanks for filling me in.

00:07:27.739 --> 00:07:30.658 position:50% align:center
You firefighters
can pull back now.

00:07:30.742 --> 00:07:32.619 position:50% align:center
We'll deal with the
feisty one first.

00:07:32.702 --> 00:07:35.163 position:50% align:center
I doubt the low point
one's going anywhere.

00:07:35.246 --> 00:07:37.332 position:50% align:center
[FIRE SOLDIERS chuckling]

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:44.047 position:50% align:center
I beg your pardon,
Mr. Fire Soldier,

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:45.715 position:50% align:center
but my husband is
patiently enduring

00:07:45.799 --> 00:07:47.342 position:50% align:center
the intense heat
of those flames.

00:07:47.425 --> 00:07:49.928 position:50% align:center
Please, end his suffering
as quickly as you can.

00:07:50.011 --> 00:07:52.597 position:50% align:center
There's an order of
precedence we have to follow.

00:07:52.681 --> 00:07:55.725 position:50% align:center
We'll decide which Infernals
get put out first.

00:07:55.809 --> 00:07:56.976 position:50% align:center
C'mon.

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.187 position:50% align:center
Please! Wait just a moment!

00:08:02.023 --> 00:08:03.400 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Excuse me.

00:08:04.734 --> 00:08:06.069 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:08:06.152 --> 00:08:07.112 position:50% align:center
Correct me if I'm wrong,

00:08:07.195 --> 00:08:09.030 position:50% align:center
but you've got a
lotta soldiers here.

00:08:09.114 --> 00:08:10.365 position:50% align:center
Seems like you could
send a couple

00:08:10.448 --> 00:08:13.576 position:50% align:center
to put her husband to
rest without much risk.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.245 position:50% align:center
We are professionals.

00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:19.207 position:50% align:center
We make judgment calls based
on standards of our own.

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:20.792 position:50% align:center
The point standard.

00:08:20.875 --> 00:08:22.085 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's right.

00:08:22.168 --> 00:08:23.795 position:50% align:center
To keep up my soldier's spirits,

00:08:23.878 --> 00:08:25.797 position:50% align:center
I give out points based
on how dangerous

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.841 position:50% align:center
the Infernals they kill are.

00:08:27.924 --> 00:08:29.801 position:50% align:center
To keep up their spirits?

00:08:29.884 --> 00:08:32.429 position:50% align:center
When your job involves
snuffing out human lives,

00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:34.514 position:50% align:center
the goal shouldn't be
to have a good time.

00:08:34.597 --> 00:08:38.393 position:50% align:center
[FLAIL] You're not the one
risking your life here.

00:08:38.476 --> 00:08:40.437 position:50% align:center
Just hook up your hose

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.106 position:50% align:center
and put out what's left
when we're done.

00:08:44.441 --> 00:08:48.778 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry. I know it
hurts, but please hold on.

00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:51.406 position:50% align:center
I can't help you,
so try to stay strong.

00:08:51.489 --> 00:08:52.824 position:50% align:center
Pardon, ma'am.

00:08:52.907 --> 00:08:55.618 position:50% align:center
With your permission,
I'd be willing to step in.

00:08:55.702 --> 00:08:58.830 position:50% align:center
I can bring your husband's
suffering to an end.

00:08:58.913 --> 00:09:00.623 position:50% align:center
Would that be all right?

00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:12.052 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA]
What're you planning to do?

00:09:12.135 --> 00:09:13.970 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:14.054 --> 00:09:15.472 position:50% align:center
Who might you be?

00:09:15.555 --> 00:09:19.267 position:50% align:center
Takehisa Hinawa.
Sergeant with the Armed Forces.

00:09:25.815 --> 00:09:27.609 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
This is Blue Stripes territory.

00:09:27.692 --> 00:09:30.153 position:50% align:center
If a soldier like you or
a firefighter like me

00:09:30.236 --> 00:09:33.615 position:50% align:center
cuts through that tape,
we'll be severely punished.

00:09:35.992 --> 00:09:37.369 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA]
No punishment could compare

00:09:37.452 --> 00:09:39.954 position:50% align:center
to what the Infernal in this
building is going through.

00:09:40.038 --> 00:09:41.623 position:50% align:center
We both know that.

00:09:41.706 --> 00:09:44.584 position:50% align:center
So, there's nothing
to second guess here.

00:09:48.213 --> 00:09:49.547 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Sergeant Hinawa.

00:09:49.631 --> 00:09:52.676 position:50% align:center
Do you have any experience
with Infernals?

00:09:52.759 --> 00:09:55.303 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA] I aimed my gun
at a friend the other day...

00:09:55.387 --> 00:09:57.889 position:50% align:center
...as I was watching
him turn Infernal.

00:10:01.559 --> 00:10:03.561 position:50% align:center
But I just couldn't shoot.

00:10:06.606 --> 00:10:08.274 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't call myself
a man of faith

00:10:08.358 --> 00:10:10.527 position:50% align:center
by any stretch of the word.

00:10:11.736 --> 00:10:16.574 position:50% align:center
And yet... because my gun was
unbaptized, it just felt wrong.

00:10:20.995 --> 00:10:23.415 position:50% align:center
He really did wait patiently.

00:10:23.498 --> 00:10:25.208 position:50% align:center
Sergeant Hinawa.

00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:28.545 position:50% align:center
I don't think this is about
whether you believe in god.

00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:30.797 position:50% align:center
It's about wanting to do
as much as you can

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:34.259 position:50% align:center
for the human being whose
life you're about to end.

00:10:36.511 --> 00:10:40.265 position:50% align:center
[OBI] That's why we pray for
them and baptize our weapons.

00:10:40.348 --> 00:10:43.184 position:50% align:center
You ask me, those rituals
offer a type of salvation

00:10:43.268 --> 00:10:45.979 position:50% align:center
to those who kill
Infernals, too.

00:10:47.647 --> 00:10:49.649 position:50% align:center
Start the prayer for us.

00:10:52.235 --> 00:10:55.822 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:10:55.905 --> 00:10:58.575 position:50% align:center
The flame is the soul's breath.

00:10:58.658 --> 00:11:01.244 position:50% align:center
The black smoke is
the soul's release.

00:11:01.327 --> 00:11:03.079 position:50% align:center
Ashes thou wert and art.

00:11:03.163 --> 00:11:05.248 position:50% align:center
May thy soul return...

00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:07.083 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
I want you to know,

00:11:07.167 --> 00:11:09.961 position:50% align:center
you're a truly kind
person, Sergeant.

00:11:11.379 --> 00:11:12.922 position:50% align:center
[inaudible]

00:11:26.186 --> 00:11:28.480 position:50% align:center
What you did in there
took some courage.

00:11:28.563 --> 00:11:30.357 position:50% align:center
No, you're the courageous one.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.150 position:50% align:center
If I hadn't seen that
you were taking action,

00:11:32.233 --> 00:11:34.361 position:50% align:center
I doubt I would've done a thing.

00:11:34.444 --> 00:11:37.155 position:50% align:center
Making the choice to
take action on your own

00:11:37.238 --> 00:11:40.033 position:50% align:center
isn't really as difficult
as you'd think.

00:11:40.116 --> 00:11:43.495 position:50% align:center
Trusting yourself is something
that comes easy to most,

00:11:43.578 --> 00:11:46.539 position:50% align:center
but to put your faith
in someone else,

00:11:46.623 --> 00:11:50.543 position:50% align:center
and act on that faith,
despite the personal cost,

00:11:50.627 --> 00:11:52.253 position:50% align:center
that takes courage.

00:11:52.337 --> 00:11:55.048 position:50% align:center
You're like a hero,
Sergeant, or a knight.

00:11:55.131 --> 00:11:58.051 position:50% align:center
If so, then that
makes you a king.

00:12:06.059 --> 00:12:07.519 position:50% align:center
It's settled.

00:12:07.602 --> 00:12:11.106 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna create a Special
Fire Force company.

00:12:11.189 --> 00:12:13.066 position:50% align:center
Once I'm in a position to do it,

00:12:13.149 --> 00:12:15.944 position:50% align:center
I'll fight to end
human combustion.

00:12:16.027 --> 00:12:18.238 position:50% align:center
I refuse to sit back
and do nothing

00:12:18.321 --> 00:12:20.949 position:50% align:center
while the world burns
down around me.

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:24.828 position:50% align:center
It might be a while,

00:12:24.911 --> 00:12:27.330 position:50% align:center
but when it happens,
I'll need people like you.

00:12:27.414 --> 00:12:30.500 position:50% align:center
Soldiers who cherish
life above all else.

00:12:35.171 --> 00:12:36.965 position:50% align:center
Whenever that time arrives,

00:12:37.048 --> 00:12:39.551 position:50% align:center
don't hesitate to
reach out to me.

00:12:44.472 --> 00:12:47.434 position:50% align:center
[OBI] This is our very
own fire cathedral.

00:12:47.517 --> 00:12:48.893 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA]
About as rundown as you'd expect

00:12:48.977 --> 00:12:51.521 position:50% align:center
for a den of outcasts.

00:12:51.604 --> 00:12:54.983 position:50% align:center
So, am I the only crewman
you've recruited, or what?

00:12:55.066 --> 00:12:56.735 position:50% align:center
Yeah. So far.

00:12:56.818 --> 00:12:59.070 position:50% align:center
See, gathering people
who I know I can trust

00:12:59.154 --> 00:13:01.531 position:50% align:center
has been a pretty
difficult task.

00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:02.907 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:13:02.991 --> 00:13:05.160 position:50% align:center
I think I've got
a line on someone.

00:13:05.243 --> 00:13:07.245 position:50% align:center
She served under me in the army.

00:13:07.328 --> 00:13:09.581 position:50% align:center
Puts in a lot more effort
than anyone around her.

00:13:09.664 --> 00:13:12.208 position:50% align:center
But she wasn't really
cut out to be a soldier.

00:13:12.292 --> 00:13:14.377 position:50% align:center
She was way too compassionate,

00:13:14.461 --> 00:13:17.005 position:50% align:center
always thinking of
others before herself.

00:13:17.088 --> 00:13:20.383 position:50% align:center
I'd say that makes her a
perfect fit for the 8th.

00:13:22.594 --> 00:13:23.762 position:50% align:center
Wow.

00:13:23.845 --> 00:13:25.347 position:50% align:center
Way to go, Maki.

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:26.473 position:50% align:center
Golly.

00:13:26.556 --> 00:13:27.640 position:50% align:center
I just thought I was recruited

00:13:27.724 --> 00:13:29.809 position:50% align:center
because I have basic
pyrokinetic powers

00:13:29.893 --> 00:13:32.479 position:50% align:center
and I'm strong enough
to be a meat shield.

00:13:32.562 --> 00:13:35.607 position:50% align:center
Did you really say those
nice things, Lieutenant?

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:37.233 position:50% align:center
[MAKI giggles]

00:13:37.317 --> 00:13:39.152 position:50% align:center
[MAKI]
Oh, you're so sweet.

00:13:39.235 --> 00:13:40.653 position:50% align:center
[MAKI giggles]

00:13:40.737 --> 00:13:43.114 position:50% align:center
That was well told. Good job.

00:13:43.198 --> 00:13:44.574 position:50% align:center
The heart of the 8th
hasn't changed

00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:46.659 position:50% align:center
since the day it
was established.

00:13:46.743 --> 00:13:47.827 position:50% align:center
For the dying Infernal,

00:13:47.911 --> 00:13:50.372 position:50% align:center
we offer our prayers
and a dignified end.

00:13:50.455 --> 00:13:53.416 position:50% align:center
For the living, we seek
deliverance from the flames.

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:57.587 position:50% align:center
There's one thing we value
above all else: Life.

00:14:06.721 --> 00:14:09.641 position:50% align:center
We should get back to
the subject at hand now.

00:14:09.724 --> 00:14:13.228 position:50% align:center
This report is from right
after Iris and Maki joined.

00:14:13.311 --> 00:14:15.814 position:50% align:center
It was a hot day.

00:14:15.897 --> 00:14:19.275 position:50% align:center
Everyone was nervous, since
it was our first call out.

00:14:20.985 --> 00:14:22.195 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA]
The man who had gone Infernal

00:14:22.278 --> 00:14:25.240 position:50% align:center
was wearing these
odd white clothes.

00:14:25.323 --> 00:14:27.701 position:50% align:center
Putting him to rest was simple,

00:14:27.784 --> 00:14:31.121 position:50% align:center
but there were several
things that didn't add up.

00:14:31.204 --> 00:14:33.498 position:50% align:center
Take the strange
red cross we found.

00:14:33.581 --> 00:14:35.083 position:50% align:center
The man had no family,

00:14:35.166 --> 00:14:36.543 position:50% align:center
but the company he
had worked for

00:14:36.626 --> 00:14:39.170 position:50% align:center
was in an awfully big
hurry to retrieve it.

00:14:39.254 --> 00:14:40.422 position:50% align:center
We looked up that company

00:14:40.505 --> 00:14:42.841 position:50% align:center
and found out that it's
still in business today.

00:14:42.924 --> 00:14:46.386 position:50% align:center
It's based in Asakusa.

00:14:46.469 --> 00:14:48.888 position:50% align:center
Company 7's jurisdiction.

00:14:51.683 --> 00:14:53.018 position:50% align:center
[CITIZEN A]
What's up, Beni?

00:14:53.101 --> 00:14:54.519 position:50% align:center
[VENDOR A]
Come on by, come on by!

00:14:54.602 --> 00:14:55.478 position:50% align:center
We've got Hoppy for cheap...

00:14:55.562 --> 00:14:57.147 position:50% align:center
[CITIZEN B]
How goes it, Waka?

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:59.315 position:50% align:center
[VENDOR A] And plenty of
<i>motsuyaki</i> and <i>monja</i> !

[WOMAN A]
Benimaru!

00:15:02.444 --> 00:15:04.946 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN A] I made some
<i>daifuku</i> . Take it with you.

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:06.322 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU]
Huh?

00:15:06.406 --> 00:15:09.868 position:50% align:center
I told you before, you old bat,
I don't like sweets.

00:15:16.499 --> 00:15:18.793 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU]
She makes too much.

00:15:18.877 --> 00:15:22.047 position:50% align:center
Ah. Hey, Beni!
It's been a few days!

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:24.132 position:50% align:center
How bad d'ya miss me?

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:27.969 position:50% align:center
I wanna see your sweet
ass at the bar tonight.

00:15:28.053 --> 00:15:30.055 position:50% align:center
[KANTARO laughs]

00:15:31.264 --> 00:15:33.558 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Lemme be.

00:15:37.604 --> 00:15:39.522 position:50% align:center
The old bat made <i>daifuku</i> .

00:15:39.606 --> 00:15:41.983 position:50% align:center
If you want some,
then help yourselves.

00:15:43.234 --> 00:15:46.529 position:50% align:center
That crumbling old fossil
makes the best <i>daifuku</i> ever!

00:15:46.613 --> 00:15:48.615 position:50% align:center
If that senile crone
forgets the recipe,

00:15:48.698 --> 00:15:50.283 position:50% align:center
she may as well just die.

00:15:50.367 --> 00:15:52.827 position:50% align:center
[BOTH laugh]

00:15:52.911 --> 00:15:56.414 position:50% align:center
Hinata, Hikage,
you need to listen here.

00:15:56.498 --> 00:15:57.624 position:50% align:center
[HINATA, HIKAGE]
Whoa, there, Waka.

00:15:57.707 --> 00:16:00.126 position:50% align:center
We're not taking any
complaints right now.

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:03.171 position:50% align:center
You realize they learned
all that from you, right?

00:16:06.424 --> 00:16:08.218 position:50% align:center
Not taking any
complaints right now.

00:16:08.301 --> 00:16:09.552 position:50% align:center
Case in point.

00:16:09.636 --> 00:16:11.012 position:50% align:center
This is amazing.

00:16:11.096 --> 00:16:13.932 position:50% align:center
Nothin' tastes better than
an old fossil's last hurrah!

00:16:14.015 --> 00:16:15.350 position:50% align:center
[HIKAGE laughs]

00:16:15.433 --> 00:16:18.269 position:50% align:center
The old bat's swan
song is delicious!

00:16:18.353 --> 00:16:20.855 position:50% align:center
Oh, these students have
surpassed their teacher.

[KONRO groans]

00:16:22.065 --> 00:16:23.566 position:50% align:center
By the way, Waka,

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:26.653 position:50% align:center
looks like we got a message from
the people over at Company 8.

00:16:26.736 --> 00:16:28.655 position:50% align:center
They wanna search
our jurisdiction.

00:16:28.738 --> 00:16:31.324 position:50% align:center
Said something about looking
for that Evangelist.

00:16:31.408 --> 00:16:34.703 position:50% align:center
Too much trouble.
Just ignore them.

00:16:34.786 --> 00:16:38.289 position:50% align:center
Beg your pardon, but
we're already here.

00:16:38.373 --> 00:16:39.624 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:16:46.006 --> 00:16:47.173 position:50% align:center
You've got some serious nerve,

00:16:47.257 --> 00:16:49.634 position:50% align:center
barging in unannounced
like this.

00:16:49.718 --> 00:16:51.761 position:50% align:center
[OBI] I heard that
Captain Shinmon Benimaru

00:16:51.845 --> 00:16:54.764 position:50% align:center
hated formalities and red tape,

00:16:54.848 --> 00:16:57.726 position:50% align:center
so I thought I'd skip
making an appointment.

00:17:00.478 --> 00:17:04.024 position:50% align:center
Fine, if you're here then,
you're here. Whatever.

00:17:04.107 --> 00:17:07.193 position:50% align:center
But I don't give a damn about
this investigation of yours.

00:17:07.277 --> 00:17:08.486 position:50% align:center
Regardless of the reason,

00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:11.364 position:50% align:center
I can't have you disrupting
things on my turf.

00:17:11.448 --> 00:17:13.533 position:50% align:center
The Evangelist has been
creating Infernals

00:17:13.616 --> 00:17:15.285 position:50% align:center
through artificial means.

00:17:15.368 --> 00:17:16.953 position:50% align:center
And there's a chance
that the White-Clad

00:17:17.037 --> 00:17:20.623 position:50% align:center
will target the people
of this area next.

00:17:20.707 --> 00:17:23.752 position:50% align:center
That's coming from the
Tokyo Empire, correct?

00:17:23.835 --> 00:17:25.211 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm not a trusting soul,

00:17:25.295 --> 00:17:27.255 position:50% align:center
and I've never seen one of
these so-called "White-Clad"

00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:29.841 position:50% align:center
turn someone into an Infernal.

00:17:29.924 --> 00:17:32.594 position:50% align:center
[BOTH scream]

00:17:35.513 --> 00:17:38.558 position:50% align:center
I have no reason to believe
that it's actually happening.

00:17:38.641 --> 00:17:40.977 position:50% align:center
You might not've
seen it, but I have!

00:17:41.061 --> 00:17:42.979 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU] I don't care
what some imperial lapdog

00:17:43.063 --> 00:17:45.190 position:50% align:center
thinks they saw.

00:17:45.273 --> 00:17:47.859 position:50% align:center
And I'm especially uninterested
in hearing tall tales

00:17:47.942 --> 00:17:49.819 position:50% align:center
from a gullible puppy.

00:17:49.903 --> 00:17:51.446 position:50% align:center
That's funny, 'cause
I'm not interested

00:17:51.529 --> 00:17:54.532 position:50% align:center
in taking crap from
a do-nothing skeptic.

00:17:56.242 --> 00:17:58.161 position:50% align:center
Captain Shinmon, is that right?

00:17:58.244 --> 00:18:00.705 position:50% align:center
I hear you're the strongest
soldier around.

00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:03.124 position:50% align:center
From what I've been told,
it's because you're so tough

00:18:03.208 --> 00:18:05.710 position:50% align:center
that your town's fire brigade
was brought into the Force.

00:18:05.794 --> 00:18:07.212 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm a tough guy, too.

00:18:07.295 --> 00:18:10.382 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna kick your ass and
make you see things my way.

00:18:11.466 --> 00:18:15.136 position:50% align:center
"Fires and fistfights are

[CREWMAN A]
Fire! Fire! Fire!

00:18:25.689 --> 00:18:26.898 position:50% align:center
Someone turned Infernal?

00:18:26.981 --> 00:18:29.859 position:50% align:center
Why'd you have to go and
jinx us like that, Waka?

00:18:29.943 --> 00:18:31.111 position:50% align:center
Damn it.

00:18:34.114 --> 00:18:37.325 position:50% align:center
I better not see Company
Eight here when I get back.

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:45.667 position:50% align:center

Must be that way.

Who is it?

He was nagging me about drinking
with him just a minute ago.

Our friend Kantaro from Block
Three has turned Infernal!

00:19:06.438 --> 00:19:08.189 position:50% align:center
What's he planning to do?

00:19:08.273 --> 00:19:11.234 position:50% align:center
He loves a good festival,
so let's start!

What the--?!

00:19:29.711 --> 00:19:31.212 position:50% align:center
Didn't know he could fly.

00:19:31.296 --> 00:19:34.799 position:50% align:center
What kind of power does the
captain of the Seventh have?

There you are, you old fart!

[7TH CREWMEN]
Waka!

00:19:55.362 --> 00:19:56.738 position:50% align:center
So many houses.

00:19:56.821 --> 00:20:00.658 position:50% align:center
At the end of the day,
homes can always be rebuilt.

00:20:00.742 --> 00:20:03.119 position:50% align:center
But now that Kantaro has
become an Infernal,

00:20:03.203 --> 00:20:06.706 position:50% align:center
his life is over and there's
nothing that can change that.

00:20:10.001 --> 00:20:11.378 position:50% align:center
What's goin' on here?

00:20:11.461 --> 00:20:14.130 position:50% align:center
Is he igniting those fires
and controlling the flames?

00:20:14.214 --> 00:20:17.384 position:50% align:center
I think there must be a trick
to those <i>matoi</i> flags he uses.

00:20:17.467 --> 00:20:20.261 position:50% align:center
There's no trick. He started
those fires himself.

00:20:20.345 --> 00:20:22.263 position:50% align:center
Beni can wield both
second-generation

00:20:22.347 --> 00:20:24.683 position:50% align:center
and third-generation powers.

00:20:24.766 --> 00:20:26.434 position:50% align:center
He can create his own fires

00:20:26.518 --> 00:20:28.728 position:50% align:center
and manipulate them
as he pleases.

00:20:28.812 --> 00:20:32.774 position:50% align:center
Unlike any other, he's a
compound Fire Soldier.

00:20:40.115 --> 00:20:43.910 position:50% align:center
Look at this, Kantaro!
The whole town is in shambles!

00:20:43.993 --> 00:20:45.912 position:50% align:center
You're too old to be
raisin' this kind of hell,

00:20:45.995 --> 00:20:47.288 position:50% align:center
and you know it.

That being said,

00:20:52.293 --> 00:20:56.548 position:50% align:center
you always did enjoy
making a scene, right?

00:21:05.348 --> 00:21:07.809 position:50% align:center
Way to hang in there, friend.

00:21:21.823 --> 00:21:23.366 position:50% align:center
Thanks, young man.

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:27.328 position:50% align:center
You helped me see him through,
all the way to the end.

00:21:28.455 --> 00:21:30.665 position:50% align:center
So what do you think
of what you just saw?

00:21:30.749 --> 00:21:32.834 position:50% align:center
Did Beni's way of putting
someone to rest

00:21:32.917 --> 00:21:35.086 position:50% align:center
seem a bit rough to you?

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:37.839 position:50% align:center
Your Sister's prayers
are a gift to your dead.

00:21:37.922 --> 00:21:40.925 position:50% align:center
We destroy our town
as a gift to ours.

00:21:41.009 --> 00:21:43.803 position:50% align:center
Everybody in our world
lives in continuous fear

00:21:43.887 --> 00:21:46.348 position:50% align:center
of the flames of
Infernalization.

00:21:46.431 --> 00:21:48.683 position:50% align:center
We're all looking to our deaths.

00:21:48.767 --> 00:21:52.103 position:50% align:center
As for the people here,
if we have to die,

00:21:52.187 --> 00:21:55.940 position:50% align:center
there's no way we'd prefer
to go out than at his hands.

00:21:56.024 --> 00:22:02.072 position:50% align:center
The hands of Shinmon Benimaru,
the Destroyer of Asakusa.

00:22:27.514 --> 00:22:29.265 position:50% align:center
It's too sweet.
