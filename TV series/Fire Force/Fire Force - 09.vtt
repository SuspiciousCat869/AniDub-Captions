00:00:12.303 --> 00:00:14.764 position:50% align:center
[OBI] Causes of death
are many and varied.

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:18.226 position:50% align:center
Old age. Illness. Suicide.

00:00:18.309 --> 00:00:20.020 position:50% align:center
But out of that long,
morbid list,

00:00:20.103 --> 00:00:23.648 position:50% align:center
there's one end that people
fear above all others...

00:00:26.234 --> 00:00:28.236 position:50% align:center line:10%
[OBI]
Death by fire.

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:39.330 position:50% align:center
They're giving this
everything they have,

00:00:39.414 --> 00:00:40.915 position:50% align:center
and they're only kids!

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:42.417 position:50% align:center
I put my faith in you.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.003 position:50% align:center
I believed you could
take the fall for me!

00:00:45.086 --> 00:00:47.213 position:50% align:center
What the hell's gotten
into you?! I trusted...

00:00:47.297 --> 00:00:50.550 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
I cared for you so much.

00:00:50.633 --> 00:00:55.347 position:50% align:center
Lieutenant Rekka,
why are you doing this?

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:02.354 position:50% align:center
What do we know?

00:01:02.437 --> 00:01:04.689 position:50% align:center
An Infernal was seen
walking the streets.

00:01:04.773 --> 00:01:07.609 position:50% align:center
There's fire where it
turned. Let's find it.

00:01:11.488 --> 00:01:13.365 position:50% align:center
[REKKA]
Tamaki! Can you keep up?

00:01:13.448 --> 00:01:15.533 position:50% align:center
Uh, yes, sir!
Don't worry about me!

00:01:15.617 --> 00:01:17.410 position:50% align:center
There's an Infernal
somewhere close.

00:01:17.494 --> 00:01:19.120 position:50% align:center
Keep an eye out
and stick with us!

00:01:19.204 --> 00:01:21.873 position:50% align:center
Understood, Lieutenant
Rekka. I'll do that!

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.129 position:50% align:center
[REKKA] There it is!
Leave this one to me!

00:01:28.213 --> 00:01:31.007 position:50% align:center
Hold it, Rekka!
Don't rush to rushing in!

00:01:36.846 --> 00:01:38.473 position:50% align:center
Start the prayer.

00:01:39.641 --> 00:01:41.184 position:50% align:center
The flame is the soul's breath.

00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:43.061 position:50% align:center
Ashes thou wert and art.

00:01:43.144 --> 00:01:47.357 position:50% align:center
[LI, REKKA] May thy soul return
to the great flame of fire!

00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:49.943 position:50% align:center
<i>LÃ¡tom</i> .

00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:01.913 position:50% align:center
You're way too reckless.
Why do you jump in like that?

00:02:01.996 --> 00:02:05.625 position:50% align:center
I get to be reckless 'cause
I trust you to watch my back!

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:08.420 position:50% align:center
Well, when you charge ahead of
me, your back's all I can see.

00:02:08.503 --> 00:02:09.421 position:50% align:center
My stars!

00:02:09.504 --> 00:02:10.588 position:50% align:center
You can't just brush this off

00:02:10.672 --> 00:02:12.424 position:50% align:center
with one of your
grinning star smiles.

00:02:12.507 --> 00:02:14.509 position:50% align:center
My stars?

00:02:14.592 --> 00:02:15.593 position:50% align:center
My stars!

00:02:15.677 --> 00:02:17.053 position:50% align:center
[KARIM]
I don't care how flashily you...

00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:20.598 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI] They all rely on
each other. They're so cool!

00:02:20.682 --> 00:02:23.601 position:50% align:center
I need you to die, Tamaki!

00:02:23.685 --> 00:02:28.273 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI] Somebody...
please just make him stop.

00:02:28.356 --> 00:02:30.150 position:50% align:center
Help me, please.

00:02:54.632 --> 00:02:56.259 position:50% align:center
Hey, there, Tamaki.

00:02:56.343 --> 00:02:57.886 position:50% align:center
You all right?

00:04:58.882 --> 00:05:00.258 position:50% align:center
[REKKA]
My stars!

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:02.594 position:50% align:center
Oh, no!

00:05:06.097 --> 00:05:09.517 position:50% align:center
Lieutenant Hoshimiya, care to
explain what's going on here?

00:05:09.601 --> 00:05:12.228 position:50% align:center
Don't interfere with my work!

00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:14.814 position:50% align:center
Or you'll feel my Star Fist Jab!

00:05:30.622 --> 00:05:32.415 position:50% align:center
It's all over, Lieutenant!

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:34.334 position:50% align:center
With the hero
"Catch-the-Dirtbag-

00:05:34.417 --> 00:05:36.419 position:50% align:center
Who's-Been-Turning-
People-Into-Infernals" Man

00:05:36.503 --> 00:05:39.089 position:50% align:center
on the scene,
there's nowhere to run!

00:05:39.172 --> 00:05:39.798 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:41.800 position:50% align:center
[REKKA growls]

00:05:41.883 --> 00:05:44.260 position:50% align:center
I don't care if there's
nowhere to fall back to.

00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:48.264 position:50% align:center
Because the only direction
I ever move is forward!

00:05:50.308 --> 00:05:51.434 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Then call me

00:05:51.518 --> 00:05:54.521 position:50% align:center
"Keep-That-Murderer-
From-Moving-at-all" Man!

00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:09.285 position:50% align:center
This is amazing.

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:11.329 position:50% align:center
He's holding his own
against Lieutenant Rekka;

00:06:11.413 --> 00:06:13.081 position:50% align:center
they're fighting toe-to-toe.

00:06:13.164 --> 00:06:17.627 position:50% align:center
I will not allow anyone to
interfere with our evangelism!

00:06:17.711 --> 00:06:21.631 position:50% align:center
Shut up already.
Hot-blooded son of a bitch.

00:06:21.715 --> 00:06:23.174 position:50% align:center
This isn't too much trouble.

00:06:23.258 --> 00:06:25.802 position:50% align:center
Just one more body
to burn, really.

00:06:25.885 --> 00:06:30.056 position:50% align:center
[screeching]

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:34.728 position:50% align:center
It seems to be attracted
to your flames, Kusakabe.

00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:39.607 position:50% align:center
I see. It must be trying
to go back to them.

00:06:39.691 --> 00:06:42.944 position:50% align:center
Well, look at that!
It's my lucky day!

00:06:44.237 --> 00:06:46.531 position:50% align:center
To think you were
here all this time.

00:06:46.614 --> 00:06:51.202 position:50% align:center
The third person the
Evangelist is searching for.

00:06:51.286 --> 00:06:52.704 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:06:52.787 --> 00:06:55.123 position:50% align:center
[REKKA]
You have the undefiled flame.

00:06:55.206 --> 00:06:57.417 position:50% align:center
The Adolla Burst!

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.627 position:50% align:center
What's an Adolla Burst?

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.256 position:50% align:center
[REKKA] It's what we who
serve under the Evangelist

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:04.591 position:50% align:center
have been seeking.

00:07:04.674 --> 00:07:06.384 position:50% align:center
Something which can
only be possessed

00:07:06.468 --> 00:07:09.346 position:50% align:center
by the offspring
of the great Sol.

00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:12.307 position:50% align:center
The sacred flame
to lead mankind!

00:07:21.524 --> 00:07:25.153 position:50% align:center
[REKKA] It is pure.
It is unadulterated fire.

00:07:25.236 --> 00:07:28.239 position:50% align:center
I've lit Pilot Lights in
children for a long time,

00:07:28.323 --> 00:07:30.617 position:50% align:center
hoping I would find
someone compatible,

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.536 position:50% align:center
and now that
someone's right here.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.955 position:50% align:center
You put those bugs into kids.

00:07:39.542 --> 00:07:42.629 position:50% align:center
Exactly how many people
have you turned into Infernals?

00:07:42.712 --> 00:07:44.506 position:50% align:center
Why would I bother counting?

00:07:44.589 --> 00:07:48.593 position:50% align:center
Such minor sacrifices are
nothing in the face of our goal.

00:07:50.929 --> 00:07:53.264 position:50% align:center
I'm finished listening to you!

00:07:54.557 --> 00:07:56.267 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] If you think you
can get away with this,

00:07:56.351 --> 00:07:57.727 position:50% align:center
you're wrong!

00:08:00.313 --> 00:08:01.356 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI gasps]

00:08:04.359 --> 00:08:06.486 position:50% align:center
What are you doing
there, you sicko?

00:08:06.569 --> 00:08:08.196 position:50% align:center
Uh. Sorry!

00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:09.322 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA clears throat]

00:08:09.406 --> 00:08:11.408 position:50% align:center
Okay. Cool. Let's do this.

00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:13.660 position:50% align:center
Could you give back
my skirt first?

00:08:13.743 --> 00:08:14.202 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:08:14.285 --> 00:08:16.287 position:50% align:center
Star Fist Jab!

00:08:19.207 --> 00:08:23.086 position:50% align:center
Your flames are bright,
but they're not as hot as mine!

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:24.963 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI screams]

00:08:25.046 --> 00:08:26.381 position:50% align:center
Tamaki!

00:08:31.428 --> 00:08:33.096 position:50% align:center
[REKKA]
My stars!

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:36.766 position:50% align:center
[smooch]

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:39.269 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI whimpers]

00:08:39.352 --> 00:08:40.770 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Hm?

00:08:40.854 --> 00:08:43.732 position:50% align:center
Sorry! It's not like that!
I got punched into you, okay?

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:48.194 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI] Enough already.
Just fight him, will you?

00:08:48.278 --> 00:08:50.071 position:50% align:center
Uh. Right.

00:08:53.074 --> 00:08:56.911 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
Please. Defeat him.

00:08:56.995 --> 00:08:59.956 position:50% align:center
You can't let
Lieutenant Rekka win.

00:09:06.296 --> 00:09:09.716 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Don't worry.
The hero always wins.

00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:11.217 position:50% align:center
[REKKA]
Hmph.

00:09:21.519 --> 00:09:24.022 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] My firepower's either
as strong as Rekka's

00:09:24.105 --> 00:09:26.107 position:50% align:center
or just a little bit weaker,

00:09:26.191 --> 00:09:27.817 position:50% align:center
but that won't matter.

00:09:27.901 --> 00:09:29.194 position:50% align:center
'Cause with my feet,

00:09:29.277 --> 00:09:32.655 position:50% align:center
I have him beat hard
in terms of mobility.

00:09:32.739 --> 00:09:35.033 position:50% align:center
And with all these
surfaces to jump on,

00:09:35.116 --> 00:09:38.119 position:50% align:center
this building's the
perfect place to use it.

00:09:38.203 --> 00:09:39.954 position:50% align:center
Here goes nothing.

00:09:42.707 --> 00:09:45.669 position:50% align:center
[REKKA]
My stars!

00:09:45.752 --> 00:09:49.255 position:50% align:center
The heat of my passionate
arms will burn all away.

00:09:49.339 --> 00:09:51.132 position:50% align:center
Come at me, bro!

00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:54.594 position:50% align:center
Don't let him beat you!

00:09:58.223 --> 00:10:00.058 position:50% align:center
He's packing some real heat.

00:10:00.141 --> 00:10:03.228 position:50% align:center
I barely touched him
and he burnt my knee.

00:10:03.311 --> 00:10:04.604 position:50% align:center
[REKKA chuckles]

00:10:04.688 --> 00:10:06.231 position:50% align:center
Too easy.

00:10:16.032 --> 00:10:18.618 position:50% align:center
[growls] Star Fist Jab!

00:10:18.702 --> 00:10:20.370 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:22.706 position:50% align:center
Looks like ya missed me!

00:10:22.789 --> 00:10:24.332 position:50% align:center
What's the matter?

00:10:24.416 --> 00:10:26.418 position:50% align:center
You only know how to
fight at ground level,

00:10:26.501 --> 00:10:28.837 position:50% align:center
but I can attack from anywhere!

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:32.966 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:36.886 --> 00:10:38.972 position:50% align:center
[REKKA]
My stars.

00:10:39.055 --> 00:10:40.974 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA yells]

00:10:41.057 --> 00:10:42.559 position:50% align:center
[REKKA screams]

00:11:02.328 --> 00:11:08.126 position:50% align:center
[CHILDREN crying]

00:11:08.209 --> 00:11:09.919 position:50% align:center
Get behind the pillars, kids.

00:11:10.003 --> 00:11:12.464 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but we don't know
for sure if it's safe yet.

00:11:12.547 --> 00:11:15.008 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, I'm heading
towards you right now!

00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:17.927 position:50% align:center
C'mon, Tak-kun!

00:11:21.264 --> 00:11:27.270 position:50% align:center
[REKKA gasping, choking]

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:37.197 position:50% align:center
What's the matter?
Are you all right?

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.157 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Yeah, but I
flew all the way here,

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.326 position:50% align:center
and then started
fighting right off.

00:11:41.409 --> 00:11:43.203 position:50% align:center
I feel kinda lightheaded.

00:11:43.286 --> 00:11:45.413 position:50% align:center
I think I used too much fire.

00:11:45.497 --> 00:11:47.332 position:50% align:center
Sounds like you overheated.

00:11:47.415 --> 00:11:49.584 position:50% align:center
Your flames use the oxygen
in your body as fuel,

00:11:49.668 --> 00:11:51.961 position:50% align:center
and you've burned
through your reserves.

00:11:54.255 --> 00:11:57.926 position:50% align:center
[REKKA growls]

00:12:07.143 --> 00:12:10.980 position:50% align:center
You're finished,
Rekka Hoshimiya.

00:12:11.064 --> 00:12:13.149 position:50% align:center
Just give yourself up.

00:12:14.109 --> 00:12:15.360 position:50% align:center
I finally found a kid

00:12:15.443 --> 00:12:17.821 position:50% align:center
who can serve as the
Pilot Light's host.

00:12:17.904 --> 00:12:20.990 position:50% align:center
For the Evangelist's sake,
I can't let him go!

00:12:21.074 --> 00:12:25.036 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:12:27.122 --> 00:12:30.625 position:50% align:center
Why have you been turning
children into Infernals?

00:12:30.709 --> 00:12:32.877 position:50% align:center
How many accomplices
do you have?

00:12:32.961 --> 00:12:36.172 position:50% align:center
And who's this
so-called "Evangelist"?

00:12:36.256 --> 00:12:38.591 position:50% align:center
We will seek out
compatible children

00:12:38.675 --> 00:12:41.678 position:50% align:center
and create strong
new pyrokinetics.

00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:43.430 position:50% align:center
We'll produce
countless Infernals

00:12:43.513 --> 00:12:45.557 position:50% align:center
and return mankind to flame!

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:49.644 position:50% align:center
All is in accordance with
the will of the Evangelist!

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:53.898 position:50% align:center
What the hell are you after?

00:12:53.982 --> 00:12:56.526 position:50% align:center
[REKKA] Behold the radiance
of the blazing star

00:12:56.609 --> 00:12:58.486 position:50% align:center
ensconced in the heavens!

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:00.488 position:50% align:center
What greater end could we seek

00:13:00.572 --> 00:13:02.991 position:50% align:center
than a return to
Sol's warm embrace?!

00:13:03.074 --> 00:13:05.243 position:50% align:center
We will set all
human beings alight.

00:13:05.326 --> 00:13:08.246 position:50% align:center
Engulf the earth in the
great flame of fire!

00:13:08.329 --> 00:13:11.082 position:50% align:center
Let its imperfections
be burned away

00:13:11.166 --> 00:13:13.626 position:50% align:center
by the flames of salvation!

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:18.048 position:50% align:center
We will turn this world
into a second sun!

00:13:23.636 --> 00:13:27.098 position:50% align:center
No way. This is
all because you--

00:13:27.182 --> 00:13:29.601 position:50% align:center
Want this world
to be a new star!

00:13:29.684 --> 00:13:32.103 position:50% align:center
Follow me. We're gonna
get out of here, okay?

00:13:32.187 --> 00:13:34.397 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:13:34.481 --> 00:13:36.191 position:50% align:center
I don't think so, kids!

00:13:36.274 --> 00:13:38.943 position:50% align:center
I just wanted it to look
like you burned to death.

00:13:39.027 --> 00:13:40.862 position:50% align:center
I wanted to take you
away to receive

00:13:40.945 --> 00:13:43.114 position:50% align:center
the Evangelist's teachings!

00:13:45.533 --> 00:13:48.870 position:50% align:center
Wait a sec... You take
kids from fires.

00:13:48.953 --> 00:13:51.331 position:50% align:center
[growls, screams]

00:13:51.414 --> 00:13:52.624 position:50% align:center
But in that case...

00:13:52.707 --> 00:13:54.459 position:50% align:center
...you guys could've
taken my brother!

00:13:54.542 --> 00:13:57.837 position:50% align:center
Burn, my Star Fists!
Burn with all my zeal!

00:13:57.921 --> 00:14:01.174 position:50% align:center
Burn! Burn!

00:14:01.257 --> 00:14:04.552 position:50% align:center
Stop that! You'll be consumed
by your own flames!

00:14:04.636 --> 00:14:06.846 position:50% align:center
That's true, but I won't
be burned alone!

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:09.849 position:50% align:center
I'll reduce every last
person here to ash!

00:14:09.933 --> 00:14:11.810 position:50% align:center
<i>LÃ¡tom</i> !

00:14:16.272 --> 00:14:18.733 position:50% align:center
[gasps] What the hell?

00:14:18.817 --> 00:14:20.276 position:50% align:center
[KARIM]
Don't you remember?

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:23.279 position:50% align:center
You said you trusted me to watch
your back, so I did, Rekka.

00:14:23.363 --> 00:14:26.074 position:50% align:center
[REKKA]
Karim! Don't interfere in this!

00:14:26.157 --> 00:14:29.953 position:50% align:center
Stop that. You're not
gonna overpower my power.

00:14:30.036 --> 00:14:31.705 position:50% align:center
You'll just make me
freeze you more.

00:14:31.788 --> 00:14:33.373 position:50% align:center
That's what you think!

00:14:33.456 --> 00:14:36.292 position:50% align:center
I'm about to vaporize
this dumb ice!

00:14:38.294 --> 00:14:43.425 position:50% align:center
Fire!

00:14:51.474 --> 00:14:53.685 position:50% align:center
I still can't believe
it was you.

00:14:53.768 --> 00:14:57.897 position:50% align:center
I wasn't watching your back
so you could kill kids.

00:14:57.981 --> 00:15:01.359 position:50% align:center
I came as soon as
I heard the report.

00:15:01.443 --> 00:15:03.653 position:50% align:center
Karim, what's going on here?

00:15:03.737 --> 00:15:05.905 position:50% align:center
I put Rekka on lockdown.

00:15:05.989 --> 00:15:09.034 position:50% align:center
We can question, interrogate,
and grill him later.

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:12.370 position:50% align:center
What does this mean
for our company?

00:15:12.454 --> 00:15:14.789 position:50% align:center
Spitting balls in a brainstorm.

00:15:14.873 --> 00:15:18.501 position:50% align:center
I highly doubt this problem'll
be restricted to the 1st.

00:15:18.585 --> 00:15:19.836 position:50% align:center
This is one of those
wide-spread,

00:15:19.919 --> 00:15:23.131 position:50% align:center
far-reaching problems
that spreads far and wide.

00:15:25.008 --> 00:15:25.925 position:50% align:center
What was that?

00:15:26.009 --> 00:15:27.177 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:31.348 --> 00:15:33.183 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Rekka.

00:15:33.266 --> 00:15:35.769 position:50% align:center
It looks like someone shot him.

00:15:41.274 --> 00:15:42.484 position:50% align:center
[ARROW]
Direct hit.

00:15:42.567 --> 00:15:45.111 position:50% align:center
Hoshimiya has been eliminated.

00:15:45.195 --> 00:15:47.322 position:50% align:center
[MAN B] There are more
Fire Soldiers in there.

00:15:47.405 --> 00:15:49.366 position:50% align:center
Thin their numbers.

00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:53.620 position:50% align:center
[ARROW]
Acknowledged.

00:15:56.456 --> 00:15:57.123 position:50% align:center
Again?!

00:15:57.207 --> 00:15:58.333 position:50% align:center
It's a sniper!

00:15:58.416 --> 00:16:00.377 position:50% align:center
Ya know where
they're shooting from?

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:01.961 position:50% align:center
[ARROW]
I missed.

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:05.507 position:50% align:center
[ARROW]
It won't happen again.

00:16:06.841 --> 00:16:08.426 position:50% align:center
Karim!

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:09.552 position:50% align:center
[LI grunts]

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.435 position:50% align:center
Shinra! Put up a smokescreen!

00:16:17.519 --> 00:16:18.645 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:16:20.814 --> 00:16:21.981 position:50% align:center
Tamaki!

00:16:22.065 --> 00:16:23.817 position:50% align:center
Stay with the children,
keep them out of sight.

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:24.901 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
Yes, sir!

00:16:24.984 --> 00:16:29.364 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA yelling]

00:16:29.447 --> 00:16:32.242 position:50% align:center
You saved me. I'm sorry.

00:16:32.325 --> 00:16:36.162 position:50% align:center
Company One's lost enough today,
and you're our shield.

00:16:36.246 --> 00:16:38.540 position:50% align:center
We can't let you fall here.

00:16:38.623 --> 00:16:41.167 position:50% align:center
What good is a shield that
needs to be shielded?

00:16:41.251 --> 00:16:44.838 position:50% align:center
I need to get everybody out
of this building safely.

00:16:46.464 --> 00:16:49.509 position:50% align:center
Shinra! Can you get
eyes on the enemy?

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:59.227 position:50% align:center
Two targets on the roof of
a building southwest of us!

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:00.353 position:50% align:center
'Kay.

00:17:00.437 --> 00:17:01.813 position:50% align:center
On Shinra's signal,
project your fire

00:17:01.896 --> 00:17:04.232 position:50% align:center
as far southwest as
you can, Tamaki!

00:17:04.315 --> 00:17:06.234 position:50% align:center
And do a zig-zag,
zag-ziggy kinda thing

00:17:06.317 --> 00:17:07.527 position:50% align:center
to hide your position!

00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:08.820 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir!

00:17:11.448 --> 00:17:13.575 position:50% align:center
[ARROW]
I've lost all visuals.

00:17:21.916 --> 00:17:25.628 position:50% align:center
Karim, tell me, what's
the point of this?

00:17:25.712 --> 00:17:27.756 position:50% align:center
We're demonstrating that
we know their position

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:28.965 position:50% align:center
while constructing a barrier

00:17:29.049 --> 00:17:31.634 position:50% align:center
to further obstruct
their view of us.

00:17:31.718 --> 00:17:33.261 position:50% align:center
More importantly,
we're doing something

00:17:33.345 --> 00:17:34.763 position:50% align:center
that they won't understand,

00:17:34.846 --> 00:17:38.850 position:50% align:center
which means they'll try to guess
and psyche themselves out.

00:17:38.933 --> 00:17:42.687 position:50% align:center
After all, snipers do like
to work from safety.

00:17:46.399 --> 00:17:48.777 position:50% align:center
[MAN A]
It seems they know our location.

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:51.988 position:50% align:center
[ARROW] I can't get a good shot
through all that smoke and ice.

00:17:52.072 --> 00:17:53.823 position:50% align:center
We've silenced Hoshimiya.

00:17:53.907 --> 00:17:57.494 position:50% align:center
If we fight any more, we'll just
expose ourselves to danger.

00:17:57.577 --> 00:17:58.661 position:50% align:center
Let's withdraw.

00:17:58.745 --> 00:18:01.289 position:50% align:center
We should tell the
commander what happened.

00:18:03.124 --> 00:18:05.960 position:50% align:center
Hey, looks like the
targets are on the move!

00:18:06.044 --> 00:18:07.587 position:50% align:center
Should I go after them?

00:18:07.671 --> 00:18:09.089 position:50% align:center
You're still overheated
from fighting

00:18:09.172 --> 00:18:11.925 position:50% align:center
that fight against Rekka,
so you'd just get killed.

00:18:12.008 --> 00:18:13.343 position:50% align:center
All we can do right now

00:18:13.426 --> 00:18:15.804 position:50% align:center
is hunker down in our shell
like frightened turtles.

00:18:15.887 --> 00:18:17.764 position:50% align:center
If we let them run
with the wrong idea,

00:18:17.847 --> 00:18:20.767 position:50% align:center
then I'm sure they'll
run away from us.

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:22.852 position:50% align:center
They made a hell of a mess here.

00:18:22.936 --> 00:18:26.022 position:50% align:center
All I could see of them
is that they wore white.

00:18:27.399 --> 00:18:29.484 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] There's a group that's
turning civilians Infernal

00:18:29.567 --> 00:18:32.696 position:50% align:center
and setting fire to the
scenes of their crimes.

00:18:32.779 --> 00:18:36.366 position:50% align:center
Among them are the kidnapped
children they gave powers.

00:18:36.449 --> 00:18:38.868 position:50% align:center
One might be my brother.

00:18:38.952 --> 00:18:43.123 position:50% align:center
At least I know who to go
after now: The Evangelist.

00:18:44.416 --> 00:18:47.252 position:50% align:center
Well, Tamaki, are these all
the kids you brought here?

00:18:47.335 --> 00:18:48.545 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
Yes, sir.

00:18:55.176 --> 00:18:56.386 position:50% align:center
Put this on.

00:18:56.469 --> 00:18:59.014 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI] Oh, thanks,
but I-I couldn't possibly.

00:18:59.097 --> 00:19:01.266 position:50% align:center
It's fine; just put it on.

00:19:07.814 --> 00:19:09.899 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
I appreciate it, sir.

00:19:11.317 --> 00:19:12.861 position:50% align:center
Sorry, Tamaki.

00:19:12.944 --> 00:19:16.906 position:50% align:center
But even though Rekka lied to
you, you need to be prepared.

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:20.744 position:50% align:center
I know. I lured these
children into danger.

00:19:20.827 --> 00:19:23.538 position:50% align:center
I'll accept any
punishment I receive.

00:19:32.213 --> 00:19:36.468 position:50% align:center
I appreciate your
helping us stop him.

00:19:36.551 --> 00:19:39.971 position:50% align:center
Did he start out hot-blooded
and become a son of a bitch?

00:19:40.055 --> 00:19:44.642 position:50% align:center
Or was he a son of a bitch who
ended up becoming hot-blooded?

00:19:44.726 --> 00:19:48.146 position:50% align:center
I dunno. Rekka was
just Rekka to me.

00:19:48.229 --> 00:19:51.232 position:50% align:center
It's hard to imagine
him keeping a secret.

00:19:51.316 --> 00:19:53.401 position:50% align:center
Or hiding what he felt.

00:19:56.154 --> 00:19:59.407 position:50% align:center
Company 8's investigating the
other special companies, right?

00:19:59.491 --> 00:20:01.868 position:50% align:center
I bet you're after
the Evangelist, too.

00:20:01.951 --> 00:20:04.579 position:50% align:center
I wanna see the White-Clad
stopped for good.

00:20:04.662 --> 00:20:06.623 position:50% align:center
So let's stop them together.

00:20:10.043 --> 00:20:12.003 position:50% align:center
That sounds good to me.

00:21:47.891 --> 00:21:49.809 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Our training has been cancelled.

00:21:49.893 --> 00:21:52.228 position:50% align:center
The 1st has a lot
of reports to write.

00:21:52.312 --> 00:21:54.773 position:50% align:center
And a need to
re-examine its past.

00:21:54.856 --> 00:21:56.483 position:50% align:center
Rekka was killed.

00:21:56.566 --> 00:21:59.277 position:50% align:center
Arthur ended up getting
lost while chasing him.

00:21:59.361 --> 00:22:02.572 position:50% align:center
We had to file a missing
person's report.

00:22:02.655 --> 00:22:04.449 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:22:04.532 --> 00:22:06.993 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] I didn't realize
how much I missed the 8th.

00:22:07.077 --> 00:22:11.289 position:50% align:center
I wasn't gone long, but this
still feels like a homecoming.

00:22:11.373 --> 00:22:14.167 position:50% align:center
The captain's
constant workouts...

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:17.087 position:50% align:center
The lieutenant's weird hats...

00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:20.048 position:50% align:center
The mostly cool and
beautiful Maki...

00:22:21.549 --> 00:22:23.968 position:50% align:center
[IRIS]
Here. I made you a cup of tea.

00:22:24.052 --> 00:22:27.681 position:50% align:center
Excellent work, Shinra.
You've done our company proud.

00:22:27.764 --> 00:22:30.183 position:50% align:center
Thanks a bunch, Sister.

00:22:30.266 --> 00:22:32.644 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
The Sister's angelic smile...

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:38.733 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] I only joined the
8th a little while ago,

00:22:38.817 --> 00:22:41.111 position:50% align:center
but there's something about it.

00:22:41.194 --> 00:22:45.031 position:50% align:center
I already feel so relaxed here.

00:22:45.115 --> 00:22:46.282 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:22:46.366 --> 00:22:46.825 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
Hm?

00:22:46.908 --> 00:22:48.159 position:50% align:center
Wha--?! No way!

00:22:48.243 --> 00:22:50.161 position:50% align:center
What are you doing
here, cat girl?

00:22:50.245 --> 00:22:51.705 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
Meow.

00:22:51.788 --> 00:22:54.874 position:50% align:center
Tamaki here has been put on
suspension at the 1st for now,

00:22:54.958 --> 00:22:58.003 position:50% align:center
on account of her role in
the Hoshimiya incident.

00:22:58.086 --> 00:23:00.380 position:50% align:center
We'll be takin' her
in while that lasts.

00:23:00.463 --> 00:23:02.590 position:50% align:center
I figure that with the
two of you together,

00:23:02.674 --> 00:23:04.634 position:50% align:center
you'll have an easier time
writing your reports

00:23:04.718 --> 00:23:05.677 position:50% align:center
on the incident.

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:08.304 position:50% align:center
Oh. I see, sir.

00:23:08.388 --> 00:23:09.389 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:23:10.932 --> 00:23:13.393 position:50% align:center
Okay. Well, that being
the case, Tamaki.

00:23:13.476 --> 00:23:15.979 position:50% align:center
Would you mind letting me
have your phone number?

00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:18.440 position:50% align:center
What?!

00:23:18.523 --> 00:23:19.733 position:50% align:center
Wait, why are you pretending
you'll need my number for work?

00:23:19.816 --> 00:23:22.485 position:50% align:center
We're gonna be in the
same office all day.

00:23:23.653 --> 00:23:24.946 position:50% align:center
Though, I guess...

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:27.449 position:50% align:center
...exchanging phone numbers
isn't the worst idea.

00:23:27.532 --> 00:23:29.868 position:50% align:center
So you'll do it?
Well, that's a relief.

00:23:29.951 --> 00:23:31.286 position:50% align:center
Juggernaut's really
been bugging me

00:23:31.369 --> 00:23:33.496 position:50% align:center
to help him get it from you.

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:35.582 position:50% align:center
No way! And don't ask again!

00:23:35.665 --> 00:23:38.543 position:50% align:center
[screaming]

00:23:40.128 --> 00:23:42.756 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Another aggressor
had invaded my safe haven,

00:23:42.839 --> 00:23:45.759 position:50% align:center
and just as I'd gotten
rid of Arthur, too.
