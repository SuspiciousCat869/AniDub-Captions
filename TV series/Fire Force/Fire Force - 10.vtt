00:00:17.308 --> 00:00:20.186 position:50% align:center
[PRIEST A] You needn't appear
in person, Your Excellency.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:21.396 position:50% align:center
[PRIEST B]
It's essential that this crisis

00:00:21.479 --> 00:00:23.356 position:50% align:center
needs to be addressed,
but let us--

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.649 position:50% align:center
It's fine.

00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:26.860 position:50% align:center
Assemble the eight
company captains.

00:00:26.943 --> 00:00:28.653 position:50% align:center
I'll speak with them.

00:00:37.078 --> 00:00:37.871 position:50% align:center
[MAMORU-KUN]
Goodness.

00:00:37.954 --> 00:00:40.373 position:50% align:center
What the hell am I looking at?

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.170 position:50% align:center
[OBI yells]

00:00:49.758 --> 00:00:51.676 position:50% align:center
Damn it, Shinra!

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.179 position:50% align:center
My locker has been
violated again!

00:00:54.262 --> 00:00:55.430 position:50% align:center
Enough, already!

00:00:55.513 --> 00:00:57.682 position:50% align:center
But, sir, I didn't do anything.

00:00:57.766 --> 00:01:01.478 position:50% align:center
Shinra is very busy enjoying the
handmade lunch I just gave him.

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:03.730 position:50% align:center
Don't interrupt.

00:01:03.813 --> 00:01:06.274 position:50% align:center
Guess this means you're
the one behind that mess.

00:01:06.358 --> 00:01:07.734 position:50% align:center
Don't you have an entire company

00:01:07.817 --> 00:01:09.736 position:50% align:center
you're s'posed to be
running right now?

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:11.946 position:50% align:center
Yes, but I thought I'd go
to the conference today

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.782 position:50% align:center
with you and Shinra.

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:16.743 position:50% align:center
Now, don't get the wrong idea.

00:01:16.826 --> 00:01:19.329 position:50% align:center
I forgot I'd packed a lunch and
bought myself this sweet roll,

00:01:19.412 --> 00:01:21.831 position:50% align:center
only to realize I had
more food than I needed.

00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:24.334 position:50% align:center
I had no choice but
to give it to Shinra.

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:27.003 position:50% align:center
It isn't like I made it
for him specifically.

00:01:27.087 --> 00:01:29.631 position:50% align:center
I'm not worrying about
lunch right now.

00:01:29.714 --> 00:01:32.550 position:50% align:center
Shinra! Tell the captain
to cut this crap out.

00:01:32.634 --> 00:01:35.595 position:50% align:center
Huh? How come? The lunch
is really good, sir.

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:38.640 position:50% align:center
Is it now? Glad you like it.

00:01:38.723 --> 00:01:41.142 position:50% align:center
Damn it. She's playing dirty.

00:01:41.226 --> 00:01:42.227 position:50% align:center
Help me out and I'll treat you

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.396 position:50% align:center
to all the ramen
you want sometime.

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.147 position:50% align:center
I do love ramen.

00:01:46.231 --> 00:01:48.400 position:50% align:center
I'll come as well.

00:01:48.483 --> 00:01:50.151 position:50% align:center
Go get yourself lost again.

00:01:50.235 --> 00:01:50.985 position:50% align:center
What?

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:52.904 position:50% align:center
I want ramen, too!

00:01:52.987 --> 00:01:54.614 position:50% align:center
She's coming! Run!

00:01:54.698 --> 00:01:57.909 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI screams]

00:01:59.327 --> 00:02:01.996 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Lucky, my butt.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.873 position:50% align:center
[grumbles]

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:06.042 position:50% align:center
Hey. Do the two of
you want i--? Er!

00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:09.295 position:50% align:center
[MAKI, IRIS]
Oh! Wow!

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:12.966 position:50% align:center
Hinawa. She's playing with
fire inside the office.

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:16.136 position:50% align:center
I need to make sure we take
the best route to Central.

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:17.721 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA, ARTHUR,
TAMAKI shouting]

00:02:17.804 --> 00:02:19.264 position:50% align:center
Just stay away from me,
you skirt-snatching devil!

00:02:19.347 --> 00:02:20.515 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
It fell off on its own!

00:02:20.598 --> 00:02:23.059 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
Begone, skirt devil!

00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:25.562 position:50% align:center
There's a great bakery
not too far from here.

00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:29.441 position:50% align:center
Yeah, we know! It's the best!
Maki and I go all the time.

00:02:29.524 --> 00:02:31.526 position:50% align:center
Yeah, they just
updated their menu.

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:32.986 position:50% align:center
They've got more savories!

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.405 position:50% align:center
The cakes have always been
great, but now they have...

00:02:35.488 --> 00:02:38.158 position:50% align:center
The place sure
has gotten lively.

00:02:38.241 --> 00:02:41.453 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:04:14.754 --> 00:04:17.674 position:50% align:center
You sure it's okay,
us two tagging along?

00:04:17.757 --> 00:04:19.801 position:50% align:center
The topic of this conference
is the Evangelist

00:04:19.884 --> 00:04:22.637 position:50% align:center
and the so-called
White-Clad organization.

00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:24.681 position:50% align:center
You two are the best
sources of information

00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:26.433 position:50% align:center
we have on the subject.

00:04:26.516 --> 00:04:28.893 position:50% align:center
Do the captains have
conferences often?

00:04:28.977 --> 00:04:30.770 position:50% align:center
Or is this something special?

00:04:30.854 --> 00:04:31.771 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
It's rare.

00:04:31.855 --> 00:04:33.148 position:50% align:center
This hasn't happened even once

00:04:33.231 --> 00:04:34.941 position:50% align:center
since I took command of the 8th.

00:04:35.025 --> 00:04:36.568 position:50% align:center
That should tell
you how seriously

00:04:36.651 --> 00:04:38.570 position:50% align:center
the country's taking this.

00:04:46.202 --> 00:04:48.204 position:50% align:center
[CHILD B screams]

00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:50.498 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Man-made Infernals.

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:55.920 position:50% align:center
[ARROW] Direct hit.
Hoshimiya has been eliminated.

00:04:56.004 --> 00:04:59.007 position:50% align:center
We should tell the
commander what happened.

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.800 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
The White-Clad.

00:05:00.884 --> 00:05:02.135 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:05:02.218 --> 00:05:04.554 position:50% align:center
[REKKA] Behold the radiance
of the blazing star

00:05:04.637 --> 00:05:06.389 position:50% align:center
ensconced in the heavens!

00:05:06.473 --> 00:05:08.099 position:50% align:center
What greater end could we seek

00:05:08.183 --> 00:05:10.268 position:50% align:center
than a return to
Sol's warm embrace?!

00:05:10.352 --> 00:05:12.228 position:50% align:center
We will set all human
beings alight.

00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:14.773 position:50% align:center
Engulf the earth in the
great flame of fire!

00:05:14.856 --> 00:05:17.359 position:50% align:center
Let its imperfections
be burned away

00:05:17.442 --> 00:05:19.486 position:50% align:center
by the flames of salvation!

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:22.864 position:50% align:center
All is in accordance with
the will of the Evangelist!

00:05:22.947 --> 00:05:25.700 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Then there's this "Evangelist."

00:05:26.701 --> 00:05:28.953 position:50% align:center
I have no doubt,
if we follow this trail,

00:05:29.037 --> 00:05:32.040 position:50% align:center
we can end this Infernal
outbreak for good.

00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:37.712 position:50% align:center
Oh, whoa! Is that
what I think it is?

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:40.548 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Of course.

00:05:40.632 --> 00:05:43.385 position:50% align:center
Wait, have you never seen
it before? Cool, right?

00:05:43.468 --> 00:05:45.512 position:50% align:center
That thermal plant was built
when the Solar calendar

00:05:45.595 --> 00:05:47.222 position:50% align:center
was first put into place.

00:05:47.305 --> 00:05:50.892 position:50% align:center
Our perpetual power
plant: Amaterasu.

00:05:52.936 --> 00:05:56.898 position:50% align:center
Amaterasu provides electricity
for the entire Empire.

00:05:56.981 --> 00:06:01.361 position:50% align:center
So it all comes from there?
Must have some crazy firepower.

00:06:10.203 --> 00:06:13.289 position:50% align:center
Thanks again for everything
you did the other day.

00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:16.001 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] No. I should be
the one thanking you.

00:06:19.713 --> 00:06:23.508 position:50% align:center
I'm Lieutenant Karim Flam.
Part of Company 1.

00:06:25.176 --> 00:06:28.096 position:50% align:center
Shinra told me all about
what happened with Rekka.

00:06:28.179 --> 00:06:31.141 position:50% align:center
I want to find out
why Rekka betrayed us.

00:06:31.224 --> 00:06:34.269 position:50% align:center
Towards that end, I want to work
with you guys at the 8th.

00:06:34.352 --> 00:06:38.148 position:50% align:center
I hear you're a capable
man, so thanks.

00:06:46.197 --> 00:06:49.367 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] I thought we shared
an allegiance to Haijima.

00:06:49.451 --> 00:06:51.244 position:50% align:center
Was I mistaken?

00:06:51.327 --> 00:06:52.746 position:50% align:center
What're you trying to say?

00:06:52.829 --> 00:06:54.622 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] You've been
spending quite a bit of time

00:06:54.706 --> 00:06:56.332 position:50% align:center
with the 8th.

00:06:56.416 --> 00:07:00.128 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA]
Heh. You're being ridiculous.

00:07:00.211 --> 00:07:02.922 position:50% align:center
The captains' conference
is about to start.

00:07:49.177 --> 00:07:50.345 position:50% align:center
The 7th is here,

00:07:50.428 --> 00:07:52.847 position:50% align:center
and they don't normally
show up for anything.

00:07:52.931 --> 00:07:54.849 position:50% align:center
Tells you how urgent this is.

00:07:54.933 --> 00:07:56.351 position:50% align:center
That's their captain?

00:07:56.434 --> 00:08:00.689 position:50% align:center
They say he's the strongest
soldier in the Force. Crazy.

00:08:02.023 --> 00:08:04.192 position:50% align:center
The hell are you
grinning at, snot face?

00:08:04.275 --> 00:08:05.527 position:50% align:center
Waka.

00:08:16.788 --> 00:08:18.998 position:50% align:center
Come on. Tent hands.

00:08:20.125 --> 00:08:21.626 position:50% align:center
The time has come.

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:25.588 position:50% align:center
All company captains, as well
as their guests, have arrived.

00:08:30.844 --> 00:08:34.097 position:50% align:center
[RAFFLES III] Let's begin this
emergency conference at once.

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:37.058 position:50% align:center
I've spoken with the
general of the Tokyo Army

00:08:37.142 --> 00:08:40.520 position:50% align:center
and the chief of the
Fire Defense Agency.

00:08:40.603 --> 00:08:43.231 position:50% align:center
They told me of a group
acting in secret.

00:08:43.314 --> 00:08:45.400 position:50% align:center
Threatening our nation's safety.

00:08:45.483 --> 00:08:47.027 position:50% align:center
Indulging in blasphemy,

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:50.530 position:50% align:center
they would defile the
great Sol's blessings.

00:08:50.613 --> 00:08:53.283 position:50% align:center
Brave captains of the
Special Fire Force,

00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:56.703 position:50% align:center
I call on you to make these
blasphemers pay for their sins.

00:08:56.786 --> 00:08:59.372 position:50% align:center
Would ya stop rambling
about your sun god?

00:08:59.456 --> 00:09:01.416 position:50% align:center
What? Benimaru Shinmon!

00:09:01.499 --> 00:09:03.460 position:50% align:center
You stand before
our great Emperor!

00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:06.212 position:50% align:center
You should cease your insolence
and treat him with respect,

00:09:06.296 --> 00:09:07.589 position:50% align:center
or face Gustav Honda's wrath!

00:09:07.672 --> 00:09:09.674 position:50% align:center
Shut your mouth, Honda Gustav.

00:09:09.758 --> 00:09:12.302 position:50% align:center
I don't like hearin'
my name said backwards.

00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:14.346 position:50% align:center
He prefers his surname first?

00:09:14.429 --> 00:09:17.640 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] You must be
a proto-nationalist.

00:09:17.724 --> 00:09:20.602 position:50% align:center
Look, the 7th is nothing
but a bunch of idiots

00:09:20.685 --> 00:09:22.437 position:50% align:center
from the vigilante corps.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.689 position:50% align:center
I don't recall swearing
any oaths to your god

00:09:24.773 --> 00:09:27.233 position:50% align:center
or your empire.

00:09:27.317 --> 00:09:29.277 position:50% align:center
We're gonna keep on
as we have been.

00:09:29.361 --> 00:09:31.654 position:50% align:center
[GUSTAV] Hey! Come back!
We aren't finished talking yet!

00:09:31.738 --> 00:09:32.906 position:50% align:center
That's enough!

00:09:32.989 --> 00:09:34.199 position:50% align:center
[door closes]

00:09:40.663 --> 00:09:42.207 position:50% align:center
[RAFFLES III coughs]

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:46.544 position:50% align:center
As I was saying, I want all your
companies to work together

00:09:46.628 --> 00:09:49.881 position:50% align:center
and defeat the Evangelist.

00:09:49.964 --> 00:09:53.426 position:50% align:center
That will put us back on
the path to saving mankind

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:54.594 position:50% align:center
from the fear of the flames.

00:09:54.678 --> 00:09:58.431 position:50% align:center
It sounds like they're
getting closer.

00:09:58.515 --> 00:10:03.853 position:50% align:center
Not too shabby, Devilfoot.
He did it sooner than expected.

00:10:03.937 --> 00:10:06.481 position:50% align:center
The boy has real potential.

00:10:06.564 --> 00:10:09.192 position:50% align:center
Maybe I'll pay him
another visit soon.

00:10:09.275 --> 00:10:11.611 position:50% align:center
Shinra Kusakabe.

00:10:11.695 --> 00:10:13.071 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Yes, sir!

00:10:13.154 --> 00:10:16.408 position:50% align:center
[RAFFLES III] I understand
you possess an Adolla Burst.

00:10:21.663 --> 00:10:24.541 position:50% align:center
Rekka Hoshimiya said that I did.

00:10:26.918 --> 00:10:29.170 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Sir, what exactly
is an Adolla Burst?

00:10:29.254 --> 00:10:32.716 position:50% align:center
[RAFFLES III] It is an unsullied
flame of absolute purity.

00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:34.676 position:50% align:center
The primordial flame.

00:10:34.759 --> 00:10:38.596 position:50% align:center
The spark from which Sol
fashioned the world we live in.

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:41.641 position:50% align:center
When you were coming here,
did you not see it?

00:10:41.725 --> 00:10:43.059 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Hm?

00:10:43.143 --> 00:10:45.979 position:50% align:center
[RAFFLES III] Tokyo's perpetual
thermal energy plant.

00:10:46.062 --> 00:10:49.315 position:50% align:center
Amaterasu provides power
for the whole Empire.

00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:53.611 position:50% align:center
All that energy comes from
a flame, which, like yours,

00:10:53.695 --> 00:10:55.697 position:50% align:center
is an Adolla Burst.

00:11:04.039 --> 00:11:05.582 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
It seems that the Evangelist

00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:07.917 position:50% align:center
wishes to obtain Adolla Bursts.

00:11:08.001 --> 00:11:11.796 position:50% align:center
It's known that these are
flames of high purity.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.506 position:50% align:center
But how they differ
from common flames

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:16.176 position:50% align:center
has yet to be explained
by science.

00:11:16.259 --> 00:11:20.305 position:50% align:center
Unless the Evangelist found
the difference before we could.

00:11:21.723 --> 00:11:24.100 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] The Evangelist
will target Kusakabe.

00:11:24.184 --> 00:11:26.394 position:50% align:center
Perhaps he should be secured.

00:11:26.478 --> 00:11:29.230 position:50% align:center
Secured? Please
don't lock me up.

00:11:29.314 --> 00:11:32.359 position:50% align:center
I joined the Force so
I could protect people.

00:11:32.442 --> 00:11:34.486 position:50% align:center
I can look after
myself just fine.

00:11:34.569 --> 00:11:36.946 position:50% align:center
There's no reason for companies
outside of the 8th

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:39.157 position:50% align:center
to meddle in the 8th's affairs.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:40.575 position:50% align:center
We should all focus our energy

00:11:40.658 --> 00:11:43.745 position:50% align:center
on finding and hunting
down the White-Clad.

00:11:45.914 --> 00:11:48.917 position:50% align:center
The 3rd wants to use
Shinra as a specimen.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.086 position:50% align:center
I guarantee Shinra's safety.

00:11:51.169 --> 00:11:54.506 position:50% align:center
Company 8 will make sure
that he never gets captured.

00:11:58.635 --> 00:12:00.470 position:50% align:center
The Adolla Burst is sacred,

00:12:00.553 --> 00:12:03.598 position:50% align:center
and Sol has chosen
you to possess it,

00:12:03.682 --> 00:12:05.225 position:50% align:center
so treat it with care.

00:12:05.308 --> 00:12:06.685 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:12:10.063 --> 00:12:12.524 position:50% align:center
[MAMORU-KUN]
Goodness.

00:12:12.607 --> 00:12:13.692 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
We're back.

00:12:13.775 --> 00:12:15.276 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
How've you guys been?

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:18.071 position:50% align:center
Not too bad.
I'll go make some tea.

00:12:18.154 --> 00:12:20.907 position:50% align:center
[OBI] Felt like this tie
was gonna choke me.

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:24.786 position:50% align:center
Pardon, sir, but didn't
Shinra go to Central with you?

00:12:24.869 --> 00:12:25.870 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Yeah.

00:12:25.954 --> 00:12:27.288 position:50% align:center
But he wanted to
check out Amaterasu

00:12:27.372 --> 00:12:29.290 position:50% align:center
and catch up with us later.

00:12:29.374 --> 00:12:30.709 position:50% align:center
So, I'll cover for him

00:12:30.792 --> 00:12:32.961 position:50% align:center
if we have to move
out before he's back.

00:12:33.044 --> 00:12:35.463 position:50% align:center
With Tamaki 'n Arthur,
we're fine.

00:12:37.549 --> 00:12:40.552 position:50% align:center
Heh. More work for me, eh?

00:12:46.975 --> 00:12:50.311 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] If the Evangelist
is planning to come to me,

00:12:50.395 --> 00:12:53.565 position:50% align:center
that suits my purposes fine.

00:12:53.648 --> 00:12:56.484 position:50% align:center
[JOKER]
Long time no see, Devilfoot.

00:12:56.568 --> 00:12:57.902 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:57.986 --> 00:12:59.529 position:50% align:center
How are ya?

00:13:11.416 --> 00:13:12.542 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
You!

00:13:12.625 --> 00:13:15.712 position:50% align:center
[JOKER] Adolla Bursts
are powerful things.

00:13:15.795 --> 00:13:19.341 position:50% align:center
One serves as the power
source for the Amaterasu.

00:13:19.424 --> 00:13:22.844 position:50% align:center
One was used to create
this very world.

00:13:22.927 --> 00:13:24.220 position:50% align:center
Though I guess I should mention

00:13:24.304 --> 00:13:28.058 position:50% align:center
it was also the cause of
this world's downfall.

00:13:28.141 --> 00:13:29.684 position:50% align:center
Whoa, there. Calm down.

00:13:29.768 --> 00:13:32.520 position:50% align:center
I'm not in the mood
for fisticuffs today.

00:13:32.604 --> 00:13:36.441 position:50% align:center
Though if you insist on having
a 'bout, I'm up for it.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.445 position:50% align:center
You don't actually think you'd
manage to get a lick in,

00:13:40.528 --> 00:13:43.156 position:50% align:center
do ya, Devilfoot?

00:13:43.239 --> 00:13:45.533 position:50% align:center
[JOKER chuckles]

00:13:48.536 --> 00:13:53.208 position:50% align:center
I've graced you with my presence
'cause you earned a new clue.

00:13:53.291 --> 00:13:55.960 position:50% align:center
Call it your reward for
finding the White-Clad spy

00:13:56.044 --> 00:13:59.422 position:50% align:center
and getting closer to the truth.

00:13:59.506 --> 00:14:01.341 position:50% align:center
You're close already.

00:14:01.424 --> 00:14:04.177 position:50% align:center
I came to turn suspicion
into certainty.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.012 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
What are you saying?

00:14:06.096 --> 00:14:08.181 position:50% align:center
[JOKER]
Keep pursuing that Evangelist

00:14:08.264 --> 00:14:11.309 position:50% align:center
and you will find your brother.

00:14:11.393 --> 00:14:13.478 position:50% align:center
The commander of the
Evangelist's Knights

00:14:13.561 --> 00:14:17.565 position:50% align:center
of the Ashen Flame...
is Sho Kusakabe.

00:14:17.649 --> 00:14:19.818 position:50% align:center
Your long-lost brother.

00:14:19.901 --> 00:14:26.866 position:50% align:center
So then, Sho is with the
Evangelist serving as a knight?

00:14:32.622 --> 00:14:34.708 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?! Uh!

00:14:34.791 --> 00:14:36.626 position:50% align:center
Joker!

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:40.797 position:50% align:center
[JOKER] Hell is a perfect
fit for a devil.

00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:52.934 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Mom. Sho. I'm sorry.

00:14:53.018 --> 00:14:56.438 position:50% align:center
I couldn't keep
that last promise.

00:14:56.521 --> 00:14:58.314 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Mom. Sho!

00:14:58.398 --> 00:15:01.401 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA'S MOTHER wails]

00:15:01.484 --> 00:15:04.446 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
I failed...

00:15:04.529 --> 00:15:08.658 position:50% align:center
But there's still a
promise I <i>can</i> keep.

00:15:08.742 --> 00:15:10.827 position:50% align:center
If what he says is true,

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:15.540 position:50% align:center
then soon, I'll have
to fight my brother.

00:15:15.623 --> 00:15:18.168 position:50% align:center
I said I'd become a superhero.

00:15:18.251 --> 00:15:21.296 position:50% align:center
I said I'd keep
Mom and Sho safe.

00:15:21.379 --> 00:15:25.216 position:50% align:center
I was too weak to protect Mom,
but I'm strong now.

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:27.594 position:50% align:center
And that promise
binds me to Sho--

00:15:27.677 --> 00:15:31.348 position:50% align:center
every bit as much as
the blood we share.

00:15:31.431 --> 00:15:34.684 position:50% align:center
So I won't break my
word. Not again.

00:15:56.164 --> 00:15:59.668 position:50% align:center
The Fire Force has been ordered
to go after the Evangelist.

00:15:59.751 --> 00:16:01.336 position:50% align:center
To start, we'll look for clues

00:16:01.419 --> 00:16:04.172 position:50% align:center
in every fire report
we've filed.

00:16:05.507 --> 00:16:08.009 position:50% align:center
This is only a fraction
of what we have.

00:16:08.093 --> 00:16:09.511 position:50% align:center
Be fast, but thorough.

00:16:09.594 --> 00:16:12.222 position:50% align:center
If it might relate to the
White-Clad, call it out.

00:16:12.305 --> 00:16:14.474 position:50% align:center
The Evangelist and
the White-Clad group

00:16:14.557 --> 00:16:16.893 position:50% align:center
have been forcefully turning
humans into Infernals

00:16:16.976 --> 00:16:18.561 position:50% align:center
for unknown reasons.

00:16:18.645 --> 00:16:22.023 position:50% align:center
We can't allow even one of
them to get away with it.

00:16:23.566 --> 00:16:25.193 position:50% align:center
Go get started.

00:16:41.543 --> 00:16:42.794 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:16:42.877 --> 00:16:44.087 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Uh?

00:16:49.843 --> 00:16:53.513 position:50% align:center
Hey, Shinra. Hurry up and
find us a lead already.

00:16:53.596 --> 00:16:54.806 position:50% align:center
What's the matter?

00:16:54.889 --> 00:16:57.308 position:50% align:center
All this heavy brain-work
takin' its toll on ya?

00:16:57.392 --> 00:16:59.936 position:50% align:center
Just keep goin'
till ya die, okay?

00:17:08.194 --> 00:17:10.071 position:50% align:center
[wheezing]

00:17:10.155 --> 00:17:14.576 position:50% align:center
Like watchin' a candle
in the wind. Sweet.

00:17:14.659 --> 00:17:16.619 position:50% align:center
Let's take a little
break for now.

00:17:16.703 --> 00:17:17.829 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Aw.

00:17:17.912 --> 00:17:20.123 position:50% align:center
But if Arthur goes any
longer, he's gonna die.

00:17:20.206 --> 00:17:20.999 position:50% align:center
Let's keep pushing.

00:17:21.082 --> 00:17:23.668 position:50% align:center
[stomach growls]

00:17:23.752 --> 00:17:25.670 position:50% align:center
Sister Iris should get
back from consoling

00:17:25.754 --> 00:17:27.964 position:50% align:center
the next of kin before too long.

00:17:28.048 --> 00:17:30.216 position:50% align:center
Why don't we girls cook
something for everyone?

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:31.509 position:50% align:center
Sure, I'm down!

00:17:31.593 --> 00:17:33.511 position:50% align:center
How's that sound
to you, Lieutenant?

00:17:33.595 --> 00:17:36.222 position:50% align:center
Could go poorly. Prob'ly will.

00:17:36.306 --> 00:17:40.185 position:50% align:center
I just ignore him when he's
rude. It's fine, let's go.

00:17:40.268 --> 00:17:42.645 position:50% align:center
I bet Maki's a great cook.

00:17:43.688 --> 00:17:45.065 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:45.148 --> 00:17:46.608 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA]
What's this?

00:17:46.691 --> 00:17:48.276 position:50% align:center
[MAKI, TAMAKI scream]

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.320 position:50% align:center
Crap! Maki!

00:17:50.403 --> 00:17:53.823 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI] Cut it out, Kusakabe!
Don't look at me!

00:17:53.907 --> 00:17:56.826 position:50% align:center
How in the blue blazes did
you end up looking like that?

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:58.870 position:50% align:center
You put the apron
over your clothes!

00:17:58.953 --> 00:18:00.497 position:50% align:center
Yeah, she's a bit
of an exception

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:02.957 position:50% align:center
when it comes to
the laws of physics.

00:18:03.041 --> 00:18:04.417 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:18:04.501 --> 00:18:08.546 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA] Maki, go get Tamaki
back in her uniform, okay?

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:09.839 position:50% align:center
I'll handle dinner.

00:18:09.923 --> 00:18:11.800 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI yells]

00:18:13.927 --> 00:18:15.387 position:50% align:center
You're helping, Shinra.

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:17.889 position:50% align:center
Uh. Sure. Will do.

00:18:39.619 --> 00:18:40.662 position:50% align:center
Are you okay?

00:18:40.745 --> 00:18:41.871 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Uh?

00:18:42.956 --> 00:18:44.874 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA] If it's not
something you can tell me,

00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:46.876 position:50% align:center
you should go to the captain.

00:18:52.424 --> 00:18:55.510 position:50% align:center
Y'know, I'm really
fond of this company.

00:18:55.593 --> 00:18:57.345 position:50% align:center
I know it can be difficult,

00:18:57.429 --> 00:19:00.098 position:50% align:center
but I'd like you rookies
to be able to trust us.

00:19:04.144 --> 00:19:06.438 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Honestly, Lieutenant,

00:19:06.521 --> 00:19:09.899 position:50% align:center
I think I like it at the
8th just as much as you.

00:19:09.983 --> 00:19:12.902 position:50% align:center
As for the other thing,
I do trust you.

00:19:12.986 --> 00:19:14.279 position:50% align:center
You and the captain.

00:19:14.362 --> 00:19:15.864 position:50% align:center
So, thanks.

00:19:15.947 --> 00:19:17.407 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA]
No problem.

00:19:22.787 --> 00:19:26.166 position:50% align:center
Dinner's ready everyone!
It's all set in the dining room.

00:19:26.249 --> 00:19:28.293 position:50% align:center
Yay!

00:19:28.376 --> 00:19:29.627 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:19:39.679 --> 00:19:43.016 position:50% align:center
So how do you think
Shinra's holding up?

00:19:43.099 --> 00:19:45.352 position:50% align:center
We put a lot on his shoulders
in the investigations

00:19:45.435 --> 00:19:47.562 position:50% align:center
of the 5th and the 1st.

00:19:51.191 --> 00:19:53.735 position:50% align:center
You haven't recruited
any pushovers, sir.

00:19:53.818 --> 00:19:57.572 position:50% align:center
Shinra's gonna be all right.
No doubt in my mind.

00:20:02.035 --> 00:20:05.246 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI] Awesome!
You made this, Kusakabe?

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:08.041 position:50% align:center
Nah. Just helped out
the lieutenant.

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:11.586 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
Uh...

00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:13.421 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Thank you for this meal!

00:20:13.505 --> 00:20:15.340 position:50% align:center
[MAMORU-KUN]
Thank you for this meal.

00:20:22.305 --> 00:20:24.474 position:50% align:center
Take time to chew, will ya?

00:20:32.065 --> 00:20:33.483 position:50% align:center
Thank goodness.

00:20:33.566 --> 00:20:36.444 position:50% align:center
It looks like you're
feeling better.

00:20:36.528 --> 00:20:39.197 position:50% align:center
We were talking about how
weird you'd been acting.

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:42.158 position:50% align:center
I thought maybe you had an
upset stomach or something.

00:20:42.242 --> 00:20:45.078 position:50% align:center
But if you're eating that much,
you must be fine.

00:20:58.758 --> 00:21:00.010 position:50% align:center
Listen, everyone,

00:21:00.093 --> 00:21:02.846 position:50% align:center
I know it's sudden,
but I need to say something.

00:21:05.765 --> 00:21:07.350 position:50% align:center
Truth is...

00:21:12.147 --> 00:21:13.773 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
I told them.

00:21:13.857 --> 00:21:15.942 position:50% align:center
About meeting Joker.

00:21:16.026 --> 00:21:19.154 position:50% align:center
About my brother, Sho.

00:21:19.237 --> 00:21:24.367 position:50% align:center
Company 8 felt like family,
and I decided to trust them.

00:21:26.494 --> 00:21:28.329 position:50% align:center
It's quite the tale.

00:21:28.413 --> 00:21:31.124 position:50% align:center
But all of this is coming
from Joker, right?

00:21:31.207 --> 00:21:32.751 position:50% align:center
Do you think we can trust it?

00:21:32.834 --> 00:21:35.837 position:50% align:center
Couldn't tell ya.
I dunno what to believe.

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:37.047 position:50% align:center
In that case...

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:37.839 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Shinra.

00:21:37.922 --> 00:21:38.548 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Huh?

00:21:38.631 --> 00:21:40.050 position:50% align:center
Tell me.

00:21:40.133 --> 00:21:42.761 position:50% align:center
Do you want to believe that
your brother's still alive?

00:21:42.844 --> 00:21:44.721 position:50% align:center
Because that's what matters.

00:21:44.804 --> 00:21:46.514 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir, I do.

00:21:47.974 --> 00:21:49.601 position:50% align:center
Understood.

00:21:54.481 --> 00:21:59.027 position:50% align:center
Well, then, all of us'll
have to believe he is, too.

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:01.780 position:50% align:center
We still need to go after
the White-Clad, of course.

00:22:01.863 --> 00:22:03.698 position:50% align:center
But we'll form our strategy
around the premise

00:22:03.782 --> 00:22:06.284 position:50% align:center
that Shinra's brother
is with him.

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:09.621 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Thanks so much, sir.

00:22:12.332 --> 00:22:15.960 position:50% align:center
[EVANGELIST FOLLOWERS] We will
set all lost souls alight.

00:22:16.044 --> 00:22:19.005 position:50% align:center
Burn the earth beneath our feet,

00:22:19.089 --> 00:22:22.425 position:50% align:center
and make this planet
a flaming sun.

00:22:22.509 --> 00:22:25.553 position:50% align:center
A scorched throne worthy of god.

00:22:25.637 --> 00:22:30.058 position:50% align:center
All is in accordance with
the will of the Evangelist.
