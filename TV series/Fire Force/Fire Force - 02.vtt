00:00:12.262 --> 00:00:14.764 position:50% align:center
[OBI] Causes of death
are many and varied.

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:18.226 position:50% align:center
Old age. Illness. Suicide.

00:00:18.309 --> 00:00:20.020 position:50% align:center
But out of that long,
morbid list,

00:00:20.103 --> 00:00:23.732 position:50% align:center
there's one end that people
fear above all others...

00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:28.653 position:50% align:center line:10%
[OBI]
Death by fire.

00:00:34.576 --> 00:00:37.203 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR] So this is meant
to be my castle.

00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:45.962 position:50% align:center
So what are the Rookie
Fire Soldier Games?

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:48.340 position:50% align:center
It's a competition where
all the Fire Force rookies

00:00:48.423 --> 00:00:50.717 position:50% align:center
that joined this year get
to show off their abilities,

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.635 position:50% align:center
and it's comin' up pretty soon.

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:54.262 position:50% align:center
You're gonna represent Company 8

00:00:54.346 --> 00:00:57.849 position:50% align:center
alongside our other new recruit,
who we're expecting later today.

00:00:57.932 --> 00:01:00.685 position:50% align:center
Hang on. There's a
new recruit coming?

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:02.520 position:50% align:center
Indeed there is.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.690 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Hey, uh, Captain?

00:01:05.774 --> 00:01:07.359 position:50% align:center
Will there be any Fire Soldiers

00:01:07.442 --> 00:01:10.612 position:50% align:center
aside from us rookies
at this contest?

00:01:10.695 --> 00:01:14.240 position:50% align:center
Well, yeah. Some of us'll
come and cheer you all on.

00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:50.485 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] There could be someone
from another company

00:01:50.568 --> 00:01:52.696 position:50% align:center
who knows about that fire.

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.079 position:50% align:center
Oh, a devil.

00:02:01.162 --> 00:02:03.748 position:50% align:center
Hoped I'd never see you
again, ya damn knight.

00:02:03.832 --> 00:02:05.417 position:50% align:center
What're you doing here?

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.210 position:50% align:center
Thought I'd slay
some hell-spawn.

00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:08.962 position:50% align:center
Still with the big talk
and dumb pose.

00:02:09.045 --> 00:02:10.630 position:50% align:center
I'll shove that sword up--

00:03:47.852 --> 00:03:50.021 position:50% align:center
Rise and shine, Sputter.

00:03:55.944 --> 00:03:58.947 position:50% align:center
[SPUTTER]
Spu-Sputter...

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.032 position:50% align:center
You really are
something else, Maki.

00:04:01.116 --> 00:04:04.244 position:50% align:center
The way you control
flames is amazing.

00:04:04.327 --> 00:04:06.121 position:50% align:center
That's sweet of
you to say, Iris.

00:04:06.204 --> 00:04:08.623 position:50% align:center
But honestly, I'm just
a second-generation.

00:04:08.707 --> 00:04:10.250 position:50% align:center
If I were a third-gen
like Shinra,

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:12.043 position:50% align:center
then I'd be able to
make fire on my own

00:04:12.127 --> 00:04:14.170 position:50% align:center
without having to
use any starters.

00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:16.506 position:50% align:center
[SPUTTER]
Sputter?

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.348 position:50% align:center
[SPUTTER]
Sputter? Sputter...

00:04:25.432 --> 00:04:27.809 position:50% align:center
[MAKI]
Careful, it's hot!

00:04:27.892 --> 00:04:30.145 position:50% align:center
[SPUTTER]
Sputter.

00:04:32.647 --> 00:04:35.734 position:50% align:center
We're finally gonna
settle the score for good.

00:04:36.943 --> 00:04:38.236 position:50% align:center
Since you insist,

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:40.488 position:50% align:center
I'll have to show you the
difference in our power.

00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:45.952 position:50% align:center
[MAKI]
Hang on. Who are you?

00:04:46.036 --> 00:04:50.707 position:50% align:center
The realm knows me as Arthur
Boyle, the Knight King.

00:04:55.337 --> 00:04:57.589 position:50% align:center
Might you be the princesses
of this castle?

00:04:57.672 --> 00:04:58.423 position:50% align:center
[MAKI, IRIS]
Huh?

00:04:58.506 --> 00:04:59.924 position:50% align:center
Who, me?

00:05:01.468 --> 00:05:04.971 position:50% align:center
[IRIS] Oh, you must be our new
third-generation Fire Soldier.

00:05:05.055 --> 00:05:07.515 position:50% align:center
It's nice to have you on board.

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:09.351 position:50% align:center
[MAKI]
Shinra. Do you know this guy?

00:05:09.434 --> 00:05:11.728 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh. Met him at the academy.

00:05:11.811 --> 00:05:14.064 position:50% align:center
I told him that knights
have jack on heroes,

00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:15.398 position:50% align:center
so midway through training,

00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:18.610 position:50% align:center
he tacked "king" onto that
made-up title of his.

00:05:18.693 --> 00:05:20.737 position:50% align:center
What a loser, right?

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.322 position:50% align:center
[MAKI]
Okay...

00:05:22.405 --> 00:05:24.532 position:50% align:center
He pretends he's the
smooth, silent type,

00:05:24.616 --> 00:05:26.493 position:50% align:center
but the truth is,
he's just dumb.

00:05:26.576 --> 00:05:30.330 position:50% align:center
He's literally too idiotic
to come up with words.

00:05:30.413 --> 00:05:31.539 position:50% align:center
And yet...

00:05:31.623 --> 00:05:33.249 position:50% align:center
[MAKI, IRIS]
And yet what?

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:35.585 position:50% align:center
Girls still think he's
cool for some reason.

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.921 position:50% align:center
Ah. Yes, that.

00:05:38.004 --> 00:05:39.589 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:05:39.673 --> 00:05:42.550 position:50% align:center
I've got way more drive,
but girls just don't care.

00:05:42.634 --> 00:05:44.511 position:50% align:center
No one can resist
a true knight.

00:05:44.594 --> 00:05:45.512 position:50% align:center
Wait.

00:05:45.595 --> 00:05:47.180 position:50% align:center
Knight King.
Ladies love a king.

00:05:47.263 --> 00:05:48.348 position:50% align:center
Well, for the record...

00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:49.808 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Huh?

00:05:49.891 --> 00:05:51.893 position:50% align:center
I think that you're
plenty cool, Shinra.

00:05:51.976 --> 00:05:53.228 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Huh...?

00:05:53.311 --> 00:05:56.481 position:50% align:center
Let's see that awkward
smile of yours, Devil.

00:05:56.564 --> 00:05:58.274 position:50% align:center
Say that again.

00:05:58.358 --> 00:06:00.276 position:50% align:center
What's going on?

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.528 position:50% align:center
[MAKI]
Lieutenant Hinawa!

00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:03.405 position:50% align:center
We just met the new
recruit, Arthur.

00:06:03.488 --> 00:06:06.908 position:50% align:center
It turns out that he and Shinra
went to the academy together.

00:06:06.991 --> 00:06:11.663 position:50% align:center
[SPUTTER] Sputter? Sputter,
sputter. Sputter, sputter.

00:06:11.746 --> 00:06:14.916 position:50% align:center
Sputter!

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.460 position:50% align:center
Fire Soldiers don't
play with fire.

00:06:17.544 --> 00:06:19.713 position:50% align:center
Right. Got it.

00:06:23.633 --> 00:06:25.176 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA]
So you're Arthur Boyle.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.679 position:50% align:center
Sure am. Glad to work with you.

00:06:27.762 --> 00:06:30.682 position:50% align:center
Come on, man. You heard her
call him lieutenant, right?

00:06:30.765 --> 00:06:33.518 position:50% align:center
We all stand as equals
before the round table.

00:06:33.601 --> 00:06:34.811 position:50% align:center
He needn't bow.

00:06:34.894 --> 00:06:38.023 position:50% align:center
Says the lowest-ranked
soldier in this crew.

00:06:38.106 --> 00:06:39.482 position:50% align:center
<i>Látom</i> .

00:06:44.904 --> 00:06:47.032 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA]
Whatever.

00:06:47.115 --> 00:06:48.283 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:06:50.035 --> 00:06:52.162 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA]
The Rookie Games are coming up.

00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:54.372 position:50% align:center
I wanna see what you've
got in advance.

00:06:54.456 --> 00:06:57.208 position:50% align:center
That means seeing your
powers in action.

00:06:57.292 --> 00:06:59.586 position:50% align:center
Now. Go take them
both on, Maki.

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:01.254 position:50% align:center
[MAKI]
Wait. Do you mean me?

00:07:01.338 --> 00:07:03.214 position:50% align:center
Do you see anyone
else on this rooftop

00:07:03.298 --> 00:07:04.799 position:50% align:center
who might go by your name?

00:07:04.883 --> 00:07:06.593 position:50% align:center
No, I do not!

00:07:07.886 --> 00:07:09.763 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA]
You lead off, Shinra.

00:07:09.846 --> 00:07:11.681 position:50% align:center
Are we s'posed
to fight for real?

00:07:11.765 --> 00:07:13.641 position:50% align:center
[MAKI]
You don't have to hold back.

00:07:13.725 --> 00:07:16.227 position:50% align:center
Are you certain that
Maki can handle them?

00:07:16.311 --> 00:07:18.980 position:50% align:center
Third generations are extra
powerful, aren't they?

00:07:19.064 --> 00:07:20.732 position:50% align:center
It won't be an issue for her.

00:07:20.815 --> 00:07:23.026 position:50% align:center
Maki started out
in the military.

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:26.196 position:50% align:center
She understands what it
takes to destroy a man.

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:29.407 position:50% align:center
Okay. I'm ready to
begin when you are.

00:07:34.287 --> 00:07:35.663 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:43.254 position:50% align:center
[MAKI growls]

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:46.800 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA yells]

00:07:46.883 --> 00:07:48.301 position:50% align:center
Whoa, Shinra!

00:07:51.429 --> 00:07:53.056 position:50% align:center
[screaming]

00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:54.182 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:08:02.273 --> 00:08:04.984 position:50% align:center
I really thought I was dead.

00:08:05.068 --> 00:08:07.404 position:50% align:center
Isn't she overdoing it a bit?

00:08:07.487 --> 00:08:09.572 position:50% align:center
Shinra has the instincts
to be a good soldier,

00:08:09.656 --> 00:08:11.783 position:50% align:center
but he's got one
glaring weakness.

00:08:11.866 --> 00:08:13.660 position:50% align:center
Fact is, he needs to be shown

00:08:13.743 --> 00:08:18.039 position:50% align:center
that his third-gen powers
can only get him so far.

00:08:18.123 --> 00:08:20.500 position:50% align:center
You won't beat me
the way you did him.

00:08:20.583 --> 00:08:22.168 position:50% align:center
Excalibur!

00:08:34.264 --> 00:08:35.515 position:50% align:center
It's still lit.

00:08:35.598 --> 00:08:37.350 position:50% align:center
Looks like a plasma cutter.

00:08:37.434 --> 00:08:39.310 position:50% align:center
Excalibur is stalwart.

00:08:39.394 --> 00:08:43.064 position:50% align:center
You'll find it a lot tougher to
extinguish than Shinra's fire.

00:08:45.483 --> 00:08:47.068 position:50% align:center
But what kind of noble
knight would I be

00:08:47.152 --> 00:08:49.571 position:50% align:center
if I injured an
innocent princess?

00:08:52.073 --> 00:08:54.325 position:50% align:center
It looks like chivalry's
dead after all.

00:08:54.409 --> 00:08:57.746 position:50% align:center
A true knight oughtta kneel
when he speaks to a princess.

00:09:01.166 --> 00:09:04.085 position:50% align:center
That's for your lack of respect
toward the lieutenant.

00:09:04.169 --> 00:09:05.337 position:50% align:center
I see now.

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:08.340 position:50% align:center
You're an ogre disguised
as a princess.

00:09:08.423 --> 00:09:11.509 position:50% align:center
How dare you call me a hideous,
man-eating, gorilla cyclops!

00:09:11.593 --> 00:09:12.927 position:50% align:center
Didn't say that!

00:09:13.011 --> 00:09:15.889 position:50% align:center
Now I'm doubting you can
understand human speech, ogress.

00:09:15.972 --> 00:09:19.059 position:50% align:center
It seems like he just keeps
throwing more fuel on the fire.

00:09:19.142 --> 00:09:21.394 position:50% align:center
That's a third-gen
pyrokinetic for you.

00:09:21.478 --> 00:09:23.146 position:50% align:center
I'm not outta the running yet!

00:09:23.229 --> 00:09:24.022 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:09:24.105 --> 00:09:24.898 position:50% align:center
Huh.

00:09:24.981 --> 00:09:25.940 position:50% align:center
You know when you're in combat,

00:09:26.024 --> 00:09:28.401 position:50% align:center
ya start to look
a little brutish.

00:09:28.485 --> 00:09:30.653 position:50% align:center
[IRIS]
Not you too, Shinra.

00:09:30.737 --> 00:09:31.821 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:09:31.905 --> 00:09:34.282 position:50% align:center
If I can't just snuff
your flames out...

00:09:35.533 --> 00:09:36.785 position:50% align:center
[FLARE]
Flare. Flare...

00:09:36.868 --> 00:09:39.454 position:50% align:center
What the--? Hey, what'd
you do to my fire?

00:09:39.537 --> 00:09:42.916 position:50% align:center
No. You got Excalibur, too?

00:09:42.999 --> 00:09:45.710 position:50% align:center
You should change the
name to Ek-sputter-bur.

00:09:45.794 --> 00:09:47.796 position:50% align:center
"Ek-sputter-bur"?

00:09:47.879 --> 00:09:50.131 position:50% align:center
So we have a devil
and a knight.

00:09:50.215 --> 00:09:53.051 position:50% align:center
Following the pattern Arthur
and Shinra established,

00:09:53.134 --> 00:09:55.470 position:50% align:center
I guess I'd call Maki a witch.

00:09:55.553 --> 00:09:57.472 position:50% align:center
[MAKI]
Sputter! Flare!

00:09:59.265 --> 00:10:00.433 position:50% align:center
Now come forth!

00:10:00.517 --> 00:10:03.478 position:50% align:center
Bo-bo-bo! Bo-bo, Bo-bo!

00:10:03.561 --> 00:10:04.396 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA, ARTHUR]
Uh?

00:10:04.479 --> 00:10:06.731 position:50% align:center
"Bo"?

00:10:06.815 --> 00:10:07.857 position:50% align:center
[BOBOBO]
Boh...

00:10:07.941 --> 00:10:10.068 position:50% align:center
Would the two of you
like to continue?

00:10:12.028 --> 00:10:16.866 position:50% align:center
[BOBOBO]
Bo. Bo. Bo. Boh.

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:18.535 position:50% align:center
Think we're out of options.

00:10:18.618 --> 00:10:21.121 position:50% align:center
If you're throwin' in the
towel, then that's that.

00:10:21.204 --> 00:10:23.540 position:50% align:center
Well, it's pretty clear
that you wanna surrender,

00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:25.291 position:50% align:center
so I'll concede.

00:10:25.375 --> 00:10:27.794 position:50% align:center
[BOBOBO]
Bo!

00:10:27.877 --> 00:10:31.464 position:50% align:center
Bo-bo-bo! Bo-bo, Bo-bo!

00:10:48.189 --> 00:10:50.650 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA, ARTHUR] Is he tryin'
to eat faster than me?

00:10:50.734 --> 00:10:53.236 position:50% align:center
Take the time to chew, will ya?

00:11:03.663 --> 00:11:06.666 position:50% align:center
Refill please.
More extra-firm noodles.

00:11:08.168 --> 00:11:10.503 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR, OBI, SHINRA]
Thank you for the food!

00:11:10.587 --> 00:11:12.422 position:50% align:center
Wow, that was some
really tasty fare, Cap.

00:11:12.505 --> 00:11:13.923 position:50% align:center
Arthur, watch your tone.

00:11:14.007 --> 00:11:15.842 position:50% align:center
No worries, I'm glad
ya liked it.

00:11:15.925 --> 00:11:18.511 position:50% align:center
The grub at that
place is top notch.

00:11:18.595 --> 00:11:20.764 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Captain Obi sure is laid back.

00:11:20.847 --> 00:11:23.558 position:50% align:center
Is there anything that
can piss him off?

00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:24.601 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Huh?

00:11:24.684 --> 00:11:26.519 position:50% align:center
Hm. Somethin' wrong, Shinra?

00:11:26.603 --> 00:11:30.315 position:50% align:center
Uh. No. I'm doin' swell, sir.

00:11:30.398 --> 00:11:32.108 position:50% align:center
Well, good for you.

00:11:34.652 --> 00:11:37.280 position:50% align:center
[OBI] It isn't healthy to train
right after a big meal,

00:11:37.364 --> 00:11:40.700 position:50% align:center
so there's no choice but to
knock out some office work.

00:11:40.784 --> 00:11:42.577 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
Why's it unhealthy?

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:45.372 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] He's even getting
along with that idiot.

00:11:50.251 --> 00:11:52.170 position:50% align:center
This thing's pretty impressive.

00:11:52.253 --> 00:11:54.381 position:50% align:center
The Type Seven Firefighting Ax.

00:11:54.464 --> 00:11:56.633 position:50% align:center
It's a durable melee
weapon that can also fire

00:11:56.716 --> 00:11:58.885 position:50% align:center
a sacred spike from
the head at range.

00:11:58.968 --> 00:12:01.179 position:50% align:center
I've no need for a fire ax.

00:12:01.262 --> 00:12:03.640 position:50% align:center
Excalibur's the only
weapon I wield.

00:12:03.723 --> 00:12:05.809 position:50% align:center
Right, your plasma cutter.

00:12:05.892 --> 00:12:07.477 position:50% align:center
By heating your
flame into plasma

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:10.313 position:50% align:center
and emitting it from that
bladeless hilt of yours,

00:12:10.397 --> 00:12:13.274 position:50% align:center
you create a super heated,
ultra-dense sword.

00:12:13.358 --> 00:12:14.693 position:50% align:center
Yeah, fair point.

00:12:14.776 --> 00:12:19.280 position:50% align:center
You pyrokinetics might not
need tools like fire axes.

00:12:19.364 --> 00:12:23.952 position:50% align:center
Every time I deploy, I've gotta
equip over 30 kilos of gear.

00:12:24.035 --> 00:12:26.329 position:50% align:center
Then there's the issue
of maintaining it all.

00:12:26.413 --> 00:12:28.039 position:50% align:center
It sure would be helpful
if we could hurry up

00:12:28.123 --> 00:12:29.916 position:50% align:center
and hire an engineer.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.752 position:50% align:center
Might take some pressure
off the lieutenant.

00:12:32.836 --> 00:12:35.380 position:50% align:center
For the record, I don't
actually mind this work.

00:12:35.463 --> 00:12:37.132 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Mh-hm.

00:12:37.215 --> 00:12:42.095 position:50% align:center
[alarm blaring]

00:12:42.178 --> 00:12:46.266 position:50% align:center
Another Infernal in Taito ward,
Iriya District! Sir!

00:13:02.741 --> 00:13:05.952 position:50% align:center
This one was reported to be
in a single-family home.

00:13:06.036 --> 00:13:09.205 position:50% align:center
Odds are, we'll be putting them
to rest in close quarters.

00:13:09.289 --> 00:13:11.583 position:50% align:center
Shinra.

00:13:11.666 --> 00:13:13.084 position:50% align:center
You'll be pretty limited
in how you can

00:13:13.168 --> 00:13:14.961 position:50% align:center
maneuver with your feet.

00:13:15.045 --> 00:13:16.671 position:50% align:center
Take the Type Seven.

00:13:18.548 --> 00:13:21.676 position:50% align:center
All of you keep your weapons
hidden inside your coats.

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.304 position:50% align:center
Don't let them be
seen by civilians.

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:33.521 position:50% align:center
Things are a little
quiet, considering.

00:13:39.069 --> 00:13:42.489 position:50% align:center
First Mama. Now Papa.

00:13:42.572 --> 00:13:46.576 position:50% align:center
How come? Am I gonna be next?

00:13:48.953 --> 00:13:51.706 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA] Apparently, her mother
turned Infernal as well.

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:53.500 position:50% align:center
Just two years ago.

00:13:53.583 --> 00:13:57.921 position:50% align:center
[OBI] And now she's lost her
Dad, too. Tough break.

00:13:58.004 --> 00:13:59.172 position:50% align:center
[IRIS]
Captain Obi, should I--?

00:13:59.255 --> 00:14:02.467 position:50% align:center
[OBI] No. Let's do this
as gently as we can.

00:14:04.552 --> 00:14:06.513 position:50% align:center
[OBI] I hear there's been
a rash of strange incidents

00:14:06.596 --> 00:14:09.849 position:50% align:center
at recent fire scenes,
so stay on your toes.

00:14:09.933 --> 00:14:11.643 position:50% align:center
Company 8, we're goin' in.

00:14:11.726 --> 00:14:13.103 position:50% align:center
[COMPANY 8]
Yes, sir!

00:14:18.358 --> 00:14:21.695 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Shinra. Arthur. C'mere a sec.

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:30.078 position:50% align:center
[OBI] I thought I told you two
to keep your weapons concealed.

00:14:30.161 --> 00:14:31.663 position:50% align:center
Why should we, though?

00:14:31.746 --> 00:14:35.083 position:50% align:center
There's no rule or regulation
that says it's required.

00:14:35.166 --> 00:14:37.335 position:50% align:center
None of our teachers
mentioned it, either.

00:14:37.419 --> 00:14:40.130 position:50% align:center
Excalibur is more than
a weapon to me.

00:14:40.213 --> 00:14:42.757 position:50% align:center
It's my pride, so why
should I have to hide it?

00:14:42.841 --> 00:14:45.427 position:50% align:center
As Fire Soldiers,
we all have our duty.

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:49.472 position:50% align:center
We must fight the Infernals
in order to put them to rest.

00:14:49.556 --> 00:14:52.058 position:50% align:center
All Infernals were once human.

00:14:52.142 --> 00:14:54.352 position:50% align:center
We can say we're
"putting them to rest,"

00:14:54.436 --> 00:14:57.022 position:50% align:center
but in truth, we kill them.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.448 position:50% align:center
[OBI] Among the ranks
of the Fire Soldiers,

00:15:06.531 --> 00:15:09.409 position:50% align:center
there are some who think of
themselves as crusaders,

00:15:09.492 --> 00:15:12.996 position:50% align:center
and relish every moment of
combat with the Infernals.

00:15:13.079 --> 00:15:16.958 position:50% align:center
Thing is, that means ignoring
the torment of the bereaved.

00:15:17.042 --> 00:15:19.294 position:50% align:center
The Infernal you put
to rest in battle

00:15:19.377 --> 00:15:21.338 position:50% align:center
is prob'ly someone's dad.

00:15:21.421 --> 00:15:22.922 position:50% align:center
Or wife.

00:15:26.968 --> 00:15:29.596 position:50% align:center
[OBI] Never let the next
of kin see your weapons.

00:15:29.679 --> 00:15:33.350 position:50% align:center
If you can't follow that rule,
I don't want you in my company.

00:15:33.433 --> 00:15:34.851 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir.

00:15:36.728 --> 00:15:37.937 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
He's right.

00:15:38.021 --> 00:15:41.066 position:50% align:center
If I'm not there for
those left behind,

00:15:41.149 --> 00:15:43.943 position:50% align:center
then I'm no one's hero.

00:15:44.027 --> 00:15:48.114 position:50% align:center
[MAN humming]

00:15:48.198 --> 00:15:50.075 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:15:58.083 --> 00:15:59.250 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:06.633 --> 00:16:08.677 position:50% align:center
The flames transformed, but why?

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:10.929 position:50% align:center
Could it've been
the Infernal inside?

00:16:11.012 --> 00:16:12.972 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Those flames are sneering at us.

00:16:13.056 --> 00:16:14.766 position:50% align:center
Infernals have no sense of self.

00:16:14.849 --> 00:16:17.769 position:50% align:center
It's hard to believe one
of them could do this.

00:16:17.852 --> 00:16:19.187 position:50% align:center
Making entry now.

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:20.313 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA, ARTHUR]
Right!

00:16:34.494 --> 00:16:36.830 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Infernal located.

00:16:36.913 --> 00:16:39.082 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
He's just sitting there.

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:48.133 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Hm?

00:16:53.638 --> 00:16:56.224 position:50% align:center
Why do these things
have to happen?

00:17:01.062 --> 00:17:02.230 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
Captain.

00:17:02.313 --> 00:17:05.525 position:50% align:center
Please let me be the
one to put him to rest.

00:17:05.608 --> 00:17:07.360 position:50% align:center
Wait, let's think about this.

00:17:07.444 --> 00:17:10.530 position:50% align:center
He is an Infernal, but he
hasn't attacked anyone.

00:17:10.613 --> 00:17:13.742 position:50% align:center
Don't be a dumbass.
The man's burning alive.

00:17:13.825 --> 00:17:17.037 position:50% align:center
It's hard to imagine the kind
of pain he's going through.

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:19.789 position:50% align:center
We need to put him
out of his misery.

00:17:22.751 --> 00:17:28.089 position:50% align:center
Time's 1706. Put the
Infernal to rest, Arthur.

00:17:34.721 --> 00:17:36.765 position:50% align:center
I will not allow you to
suffer any more pain

00:17:36.848 --> 00:17:38.558 position:50% align:center
than you already have.

00:17:38.641 --> 00:17:40.894 position:50% align:center
Sister. The prayer, please.

00:17:40.977 --> 00:17:42.145 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:17:43.229 --> 00:17:45.607 position:50% align:center
The flame is the soul's breath.

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:48.610 position:50% align:center
The black smoke is
the soul's release.

00:17:48.693 --> 00:17:51.738 position:50% align:center
Ashes thou wert and art.

00:17:51.821 --> 00:17:54.032 position:50% align:center
May thy soul return...

00:17:56.868 --> 00:17:59.287 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
...to the great flame of fire.

00:18:06.378 --> 00:18:08.588 position:50% align:center
<i>Látom</i> .

00:18:08.672 --> 00:18:10.131 position:50% align:center
[COMPANY 8]
<i>Látom</i> .

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:15.929 position:50% align:center
Was that painful?

00:18:16.012 --> 00:18:19.057 position:50% align:center
Yeah. It was.

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:21.059 position:50% align:center
Well, hang on to that pain,

00:18:21.142 --> 00:18:23.561 position:50% align:center
because the worst thing
this job can do to you

00:18:23.645 --> 00:18:26.189 position:50% align:center
is make you numb to it all.

00:18:30.985 --> 00:18:31.986 position:50% align:center
[MAKI]
Huh?

00:18:38.368 --> 00:18:39.911 position:50% align:center
What was that?

00:18:39.994 --> 00:18:42.497 position:50% align:center
Everyone out!
Before it caves in!

00:18:46.292 --> 00:18:47.877 position:50% align:center
Aren't you coming, sir?

00:18:47.961 --> 00:18:49.546 position:50% align:center
Crap, Captain, look out!

00:18:53.049 --> 00:18:54.467 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Ugh. Don't know who did this,

00:18:54.551 --> 00:18:56.594 position:50% align:center
but they must not
know me, either.

00:18:56.678 --> 00:19:01.224 position:50% align:center
I train every day. They'd
need a lot more to crush me.

00:19:01.307 --> 00:19:04.978 position:50% align:center
This damn prank of theirs
has gone way too far!

00:19:10.358 --> 00:19:14.154 position:50% align:center
[MAN] Seems to me this
so-called Special Fire Force

00:19:14.237 --> 00:19:16.948 position:50% align:center
is only blowin' smoke.

00:19:20.618 --> 00:19:24.748 position:50% align:center
Time to see how well those
clowns can take a joke.

00:19:28.752 --> 00:19:30.670 position:50% align:center
[MAKI]
Captain, are you hurt?

00:19:30.754 --> 00:19:31.838 position:50% align:center
No, I'm all right.

00:19:31.921 --> 00:19:33.715 position:50% align:center
That didn't just
happen on its own.

00:19:33.798 --> 00:19:36.217 position:50% align:center
You think we were attacked
by a third party?

00:19:36.301 --> 00:19:38.261 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure yet.

00:19:38.345 --> 00:19:41.598 position:50% align:center
If so, then they also
trashed a fire scene

00:19:41.681 --> 00:19:44.476 position:50% align:center
that was still full of
memories for the bereaved.

00:19:44.559 --> 00:19:46.728 position:50% align:center
And for that, they will pay.

00:19:46.811 --> 00:19:49.189 position:50% align:center
For now, let's just head back.

00:20:04.162 --> 00:20:06.122 position:50% align:center
Flames took my parents.

00:20:06.206 --> 00:20:08.708 position:50% align:center
And next they're
gonna come for me.

00:20:10.502 --> 00:20:13.672 position:50% align:center
Papa. Mama.

00:20:13.755 --> 00:20:15.382 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Mikako, right?

00:20:21.179 --> 00:20:24.391 position:50% align:center
Your father fought bravely
to hold back the flame's fury,

00:20:24.474 --> 00:20:26.142 position:50% align:center
and he won that fight.

00:20:26.226 --> 00:20:27.519 position:50% align:center
I think both of your parents

00:20:27.602 --> 00:20:29.646 position:50% align:center
were protecting you
from the flames.

00:20:29.729 --> 00:20:34.025 position:50% align:center
They both gave their all to make
sure that you would be okay.

00:20:34.109 --> 00:20:37.487 position:50% align:center
Believe in them.
In the love you felt.

00:20:39.864 --> 00:20:43.576 position:50% align:center
Papa. Mama.

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:48.665 position:50% align:center
[MIKAKO crying]

00:20:53.294 --> 00:20:56.965 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] I'm sorry, sir.
I couldn't do anything.

00:20:57.048 --> 00:20:59.968 position:50% align:center
[OBI] It's rare that we can
offer the bereaved much comfort.

00:21:00.051 --> 00:21:01.928 position:50% align:center
And sometimes it
feels just as tough

00:21:02.012 --> 00:21:04.556 position:50% align:center
as charging into
a sea of flames.

00:21:04.639 --> 00:21:07.308 position:50% align:center
But it's still important we try.

00:21:16.359 --> 00:21:18.153 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
Go to sleep, Devil.

00:21:21.823 --> 00:21:25.410 position:50% align:center
There's nothing to be seen,
'least not by the likes of you.

00:21:25.493 --> 00:21:27.412 position:50% align:center
Stop wasting your time.

00:21:33.251 --> 00:21:36.421 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR] Sometimes closing your
eyes can help you to see.

00:21:36.504 --> 00:21:37.839 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
What's that supposed to mean?

00:21:37.922 --> 00:21:41.259 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR] If you don't know,
then go to sleep, Devil.

00:21:41.343 --> 00:21:43.595 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Wait, is he--?

00:21:44.596 --> 00:21:46.431 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Why?

00:21:46.514 --> 00:21:49.351 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR] Just showing some
compassion as a knight.

00:21:54.898 --> 00:21:56.149 position:50% align:center
Wait.

00:21:56.232 --> 00:21:59.152 position:50% align:center
Shut up. I meant Knight King.

00:22:04.074 --> 00:22:04.949 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Hey.

00:22:05.033 --> 00:22:06.534 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
What now?

00:22:06.618 --> 00:22:08.995 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Don't talk to me
just 'cause you can't sleep.

00:22:09.079 --> 00:22:12.457 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR] Pfft. I won't kill
you if you fall asleep first.

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:13.833 position:50% align:center
Even if you're a devil.

00:22:13.917 --> 00:22:16.086 position:50% align:center
Just be grateful I'm a noble
knight and go to sleep.

00:22:16.169 --> 00:22:17.420 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Wait.

00:22:17.504 --> 00:22:19.297 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR] King. I'm noble--
I'm a noble Knight King.

00:22:19.381 --> 00:22:22.342 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] It's almost like
you're messing up on purpose.

00:22:22.425 --> 00:22:23.843 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
I--

00:22:23.927 --> 00:22:27.097 position:50% align:center
We need to bring spontaneous
human combustion to an end,

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:28.765 position:50% align:center
and quickly.
