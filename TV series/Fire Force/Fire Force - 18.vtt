00:00:25.984 --> 00:00:30.071 position:50% align:center
[IRIS] Many years ago,
mankind faced a divine fury.

00:00:30.155 --> 00:00:33.074 position:50% align:center
In an event is known as
the "Day of the Cataclysm,"

00:00:33.158 --> 00:00:36.077 position:50% align:center
our entire world was burned.

00:00:36.161 --> 00:00:37.829 position:50% align:center
The fire raged with an intensity

00:00:37.912 --> 00:00:40.790 position:50% align:center
that threatened to reduce
mankind to ash.

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:43.877 position:50% align:center
The places they lived,
the languages they spoke,

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.837 position:50% align:center
the culture they had built--

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.214 position:50% align:center
none could escape its wrath.

00:00:54.971 --> 00:00:57.432 position:50% align:center
Their base is one
ramshackle shack.

00:00:57.515 --> 00:01:00.310 position:50% align:center
Hello, Lieutenant Karim.
It's good to see you.

00:01:00.393 --> 00:01:01.770 position:50% align:center
What brings you all here?

00:01:01.853 --> 00:01:05.106 position:50% align:center
Tamaki, it looks like you're
doing well here. I'm glad.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.609 position:50% align:center
We came here to compare
notes on the Evangelist.

00:01:07.692 --> 00:01:09.027 position:50% align:center
Hopefully we can
all work together

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.862 position:50% align:center
from this point forward.

00:01:10.945 --> 00:01:13.448 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] If we end up going
after the White-Clad,

00:01:13.531 --> 00:01:16.701 position:50% align:center
then I'm probably gonna
have to fight Sho again.

00:01:16.785 --> 00:01:18.787 position:50% align:center
Stop spacing out
and say something.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:19.871 position:50% align:center
Meow?

00:01:19.954 --> 00:01:21.456 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI screaming]

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:23.416 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
How did this happen?

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.335 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI screaming]

00:01:25.418 --> 00:01:28.129 position:50% align:center
You might not be the
steed fated to carry me,

00:01:28.213 --> 00:01:31.091 position:50% align:center
but you're still my
comrade-in-arms.

00:01:31.174 --> 00:01:34.469 position:50% align:center
We've been through a lot. It's
good to have you back, Silburro.

00:01:34.552 --> 00:01:35.929 position:50% align:center
[neighs]

00:01:36.012 --> 00:01:37.263 position:50% align:center
Could you maybe not put up

00:01:37.347 --> 00:01:39.766 position:50% align:center
freaky fake animal
heads on our wall?

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:42.727 position:50% align:center
This celestial charger
just returned to earth.

00:01:42.811 --> 00:01:45.063 position:50% align:center
Thanks to Vulcan's
miraculous work.

00:01:45.146 --> 00:01:46.898 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it's a donkey.

00:01:46.981 --> 00:01:49.651 position:50% align:center
Are you really okay
with this, Lieutenant?

00:01:49.734 --> 00:01:52.070 position:50% align:center
Arthur, get back to work.

00:01:52.153 --> 00:01:54.614 position:50% align:center
I'm guessing that hat
came from Vulcan, too?

00:01:54.698 --> 00:01:56.408 position:50% align:center
Found it by my
desk this morning.

00:01:56.491 --> 00:01:59.619 position:50% align:center
Those big horns, don't
they get in the way a bit?

00:01:59.703 --> 00:02:01.663 position:50% align:center
They don't interfere
with my work.

00:02:01.746 --> 00:02:02.956 position:50% align:center
No offense, Lieutenant,

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:05.083 position:50% align:center
but when it comes to
fashion, you're oblivious.

00:02:05.166 --> 00:02:07.711 position:50% align:center
You want me to help you
pick out clothes some time?

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:09.212 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't trust you
to pick out anything

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:11.006 position:50% align:center
that didn't come
from a fairy tale.

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:13.883 position:50% align:center
Well, you couldn't look worse
than you do with horns.

00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:16.428 position:50% align:center
Okay. That's enough
idle chatter.

00:02:17.637 --> 00:02:20.557 position:50% align:center
I feel like they do interfere
with your work, sir.

Thank you, miss.
That's kind of you.

I made it with my guts, sir.

00:04:08.498 --> 00:04:10.709 position:50% align:center
What gives, Obi?

00:04:10.792 --> 00:04:12.335 position:50% align:center
Why do you have Iris
doing the work

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:14.337 position:50% align:center
of a common house
maid right now?

00:04:14.421 --> 00:04:17.841 position:50% align:center
No. It's okay, Sister,
I offered to do this.

00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:21.302 position:50% align:center
But hey, what are you
sitting like that for?

00:04:21.386 --> 00:04:23.513 position:50% align:center
I'm sitting up here because
I refuse to be placed

00:04:23.596 --> 00:04:25.473 position:50% align:center
at the same level
as this gravel.

00:04:25.557 --> 00:04:27.851 position:50% align:center
Would you feel better if
I sat on the floor then?

00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:30.395 position:50% align:center
I would. Go ahead
and get down there.

00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:34.941 position:50% align:center
What's the hold up?
You offered, so hop to it.

00:04:38.862 --> 00:04:40.321 position:50% align:center
Damn it.

00:04:40.405 --> 00:04:43.616 position:50% align:center
I wasn't actually offering to,
it was just a little joke quip.

00:04:45.618 --> 00:04:47.078 position:50% align:center
All right.

00:04:47.162 --> 00:04:49.748 position:50% align:center
Let's skip the formalities and
get right to the meat of it.

00:04:49.831 --> 00:04:51.875 position:50% align:center
We'll share what information
we've scrounged up,

00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.752 position:50% align:center
see if that gives us any clues,

00:04:53.835 --> 00:04:56.796 position:50% align:center
then decide how to deal with
the White-Clad moving forward.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.799 position:50% align:center
My company didn't think the
White-Clad existed until now,

00:04:59.883 --> 00:05:02.010 position:50% align:center
so we're still playing catch-up.

00:05:02.093 --> 00:05:03.887 position:50% align:center
Beni asked me to
come on his behalf,

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.222 position:50% align:center
but I won't have
much to contribute.

00:05:06.306 --> 00:05:09.017 position:50% align:center
White-Clad operatives have
made countless Infernals.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.227 position:50% align:center
They're especially likely
to be the orchestrators

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:13.438 position:50% align:center
of any mass combustion events.

00:05:13.521 --> 00:05:15.565 position:50% align:center
[KARIM] Rekka Hoshimiya
wasn't turning those kids

00:05:15.648 --> 00:05:17.150 position:50% align:center
to cause chaos.

00:05:17.233 --> 00:05:19.069 position:50% align:center
He wanted to find
a compatible host

00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:21.821 position:50% align:center
for the so-called "Pilot Light."

00:05:21.905 --> 00:05:24.491 position:50% align:center
So those bugs do more
than create Infernals.

00:05:24.574 --> 00:05:28.203 position:50% align:center
They're also used to find
people with a special ability.

00:05:28.286 --> 00:05:30.330 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Doctor Giovanni's a White-Clad,

00:05:30.413 --> 00:05:33.416 position:50% align:center
and he was looking for
the key to Amaterasu.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.462 position:50% align:center
I guess these guys have plans
for our perpetual power plant.

00:05:37.545 --> 00:05:40.006 position:50% align:center
The media's been told that
the man who attacked Vulcan

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.384 position:50% align:center
was actually an imposter
wearing a mask

00:05:42.467 --> 00:05:44.803 position:50% align:center
that looked like Giovanni's.

00:05:44.886 --> 00:05:47.222 position:50% align:center
But the man Company Three
sent to their press conference

00:05:47.305 --> 00:05:48.515 position:50% align:center
was the real fake.

00:05:48.598 --> 00:05:50.934 position:50% align:center
Haijima wanted to
prevent a scandal,

00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:53.103 position:50% align:center
so they made a new captain.

00:05:53.186 --> 00:05:56.356 position:50% align:center
Vulcan's seen Giovanni's face,
and he said that wasn't him,

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:59.526 position:50% align:center
so we're safe to assume
the real Giovanni took off.

00:05:59.609 --> 00:06:01.069 position:50% align:center
I hear that quite a few soldiers

00:06:01.152 --> 00:06:03.196 position:50% align:center
have suddenly disappeared
from the Third.

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:06.825 position:50% align:center
It seems likely that all of them
were White-Clad spies as well.

00:06:06.908 --> 00:06:10.120 position:50% align:center
They've probably all returned
to the Evangelist by now.

00:06:10.203 --> 00:06:12.872 position:50% align:center
I have no idea if Haijima
itself has been compromised,

00:06:12.956 --> 00:06:14.874 position:50% align:center
but as long as the 3rd
has its backing,

00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:17.252 position:50% align:center
they're out of the
government's reach.

00:06:17.335 --> 00:06:18.795 position:50% align:center
[KARIM]
The longer we wait,

00:06:18.878 --> 00:06:21.589 position:50% align:center
the bolder and more radical
the White-Clad are gonna get.

00:06:21.673 --> 00:06:23.633 position:50% align:center
Till we know how to
root out their spies,

00:06:23.717 --> 00:06:25.927 position:50% align:center
we should look for their
base and hit them directly.

00:06:26.011 --> 00:06:28.054 position:50% align:center
I agree, and I've already
got my man Licht

00:06:28.138 --> 00:06:30.390 position:50% align:center
looking into the
base's location.

00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:34.102 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:06:34.185 --> 00:06:35.353 position:50% align:center
So tell me,

00:06:35.437 --> 00:06:37.647 position:50% align:center
how's the Special Fire
Force been treating you?

00:06:37.731 --> 00:06:40.316 position:50% align:center
The gig's been downright
convenient for me.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.278 position:50% align:center
Got me permission to come
to this crime scene.

00:06:48.241 --> 00:06:49.492 position:50% align:center
[JOKER]
Is that really all you need

00:06:49.576 --> 00:06:51.494 position:50% align:center
to find the White-Clad base?

00:06:51.578 --> 00:06:54.330 position:50% align:center
Nah, even I need
more than this.

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.876 position:50% align:center
Do you believe Licht
is trustworthy?

00:06:57.959 --> 00:07:01.087 position:50% align:center
So far at least, he's
doing good work for us.

00:07:03.048 --> 00:07:05.842 position:50% align:center
[OBI] Once we've pinpointed
the location of the Evangelist,

00:07:05.925 --> 00:07:07.886 position:50% align:center
the 8th'll move in
and take him out.

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:09.512 position:50% align:center
Is the 8th up to that task?

00:07:09.596 --> 00:07:12.932 position:50% align:center
About half of your company's
fighters are rookies, correct?

00:07:13.016 --> 00:07:16.394 position:50% align:center
It'd be a shame if some
meathead led them to their doom.

00:07:18.646 --> 00:07:20.732 position:50% align:center
You might find the
Evangelist's base,

00:07:20.815 --> 00:07:23.818 position:50% align:center
but the 8th isn't strong
enough to attack it yet.

00:07:23.902 --> 00:07:25.820 position:50% align:center
Are the White-Clad that strong?

00:07:25.904 --> 00:07:28.907 position:50% align:center
You have no idea.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:31.701 position:50% align:center
Having seen their commander's
power firsthand,

00:07:31.785 --> 00:07:35.121 position:50% align:center
I believe it comes from a
direct link to the Evangelist.

00:07:35.205 --> 00:07:37.290 position:50% align:center
An Adolla Link, huh?

00:07:38.833 --> 00:07:41.836 position:50% align:center
So what does the 8th need
to do to get strong enough?

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.339 position:50% align:center
Our company's rookies
are fine soldiers.

00:07:44.422 --> 00:07:47.676 position:50% align:center
They've got solid instincts
and powerful abilities.

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:49.678 position:50% align:center
But they still have
room to grow.

00:07:49.761 --> 00:07:51.554 position:50% align:center
How can we help them
do that quickly?

00:07:51.638 --> 00:07:53.390 position:50% align:center
When I saw them
sparring at the 1st,

00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:56.267 position:50% align:center
they struck me as green
and wet behind the ears.

00:07:56.351 --> 00:07:58.853 position:50% align:center
They've got first-class,
top notch powers,

00:07:58.937 --> 00:08:01.022 position:50% align:center
but they need more
combat training.

00:08:01.106 --> 00:08:02.565 position:50% align:center
Combat training, eh?

00:08:02.649 --> 00:08:06.069 position:50% align:center
I just happen to know the best
fighter in the entire Force.

00:08:06.152 --> 00:08:08.446 position:50% align:center
Why don't'cha send
'em back with me?

00:08:09.906 --> 00:08:13.326 position:50% align:center
[JOKER] What matters most is
that our devil gets stronger.

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:16.287 position:50% align:center
Can you think of a way
to upgrade his flames?

00:08:16.371 --> 00:08:18.039 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
I might have an idea.

00:08:19.833 --> 00:08:22.836 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] But whether or not
he catches up to you and Sho...

00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:24.629 position:50% align:center
...that depends on him.

00:08:27.382 --> 00:08:29.884 position:50% align:center
Konro, what's going on?

00:08:31.177 --> 00:08:35.348 position:50% align:center
Huh? And why should I agree
to babysit their rookies?

00:08:37.142 --> 00:08:39.769 position:50% align:center
Say what? I "owe them"?

00:08:39.853 --> 00:08:42.522 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah. Guess I do.

00:08:49.612 --> 00:08:53.158 position:50% align:center
Hey, Captain Shinmon?
It's me, Shinra Kusakabe.

00:08:58.121 --> 00:09:00.540 position:50% align:center
Um, is everything okay, Captain?

00:09:00.623 --> 00:09:02.709 position:50% align:center
In a real fight, you'd be dead.

00:09:02.792 --> 00:09:05.086 position:50% align:center
Okay, step right up, people!

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:06.546 position:50% align:center
Lesson one:

00:09:06.629 --> 00:09:10.675 position:50% align:center
You never know when a foe
might strike, so stay sharp.

00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:12.344 position:50% align:center
Dumbass.

00:09:12.427 --> 00:09:14.929 position:50% align:center
What part of "stay
sharp" did you miss?

00:09:15.013 --> 00:09:16.264 position:50% align:center
Who's dumb now?

00:09:16.348 --> 00:09:17.515 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR, SHINRA gasp]

00:09:19.184 --> 00:09:20.477 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA, ARTHUR yelp]

00:09:22.187 --> 00:09:25.315 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN] Iron-madillo, the
Magnetic Extinguishing Ball.

00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:26.775 position:50% align:center
So how does it work?

00:09:26.858 --> 00:09:28.818 position:50% align:center
I'll let'cha see for yourself.

00:09:32.989 --> 00:09:34.157 position:50% align:center
And there it goes.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.493 position:50% align:center
It hits the fire with
a quick magnetic blast

00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:38.787 position:50% align:center
and the flames sputter
out a second later.

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:40.330 position:50% align:center
Way to go, Vulcan.

00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:43.667 position:50% align:center
An unpowered person like me
could make good use of that.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:44.918 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
Shinra and Arthur are getting

00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:47.253 position:50% align:center
special training
in Asakusa, right?

00:09:47.337 --> 00:09:48.672 position:50% align:center
I don't wanna get shown up,

00:09:48.755 --> 00:09:51.383 position:50% align:center
so I figured I'd make
us some new tools.

00:09:59.349 --> 00:10:00.392 position:50% align:center
[BOTH grunt]

00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:05.188 position:50% align:center
You aren't relaxing, are you?

00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:07.482 position:50% align:center
There are no rules
in a real fight,

00:10:07.565 --> 00:10:10.527 position:50% align:center
which means you can't predict
when something might happen.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:12.278 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:10:12.362 --> 00:10:13.488 position:50% align:center
Getting tired?

00:10:13.571 --> 00:10:15.073 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Y-Yes, sir.

00:10:15.156 --> 00:10:17.826 position:50% align:center
That's because you know
your life isn't on the line.

00:10:17.909 --> 00:10:19.035 position:50% align:center
You need to act like it is

00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:21.496 position:50% align:center
and channel all that
tension you're feeling.

00:10:21.579 --> 00:10:23.957 position:50% align:center
Let that stress heighten
your awareness.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.417 position:50% align:center
Feel life around you.

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.712 position:50% align:center
Not just your ally's,
but your enemy's, too.

00:10:28.795 --> 00:10:30.797 position:50% align:center
Focus on the lives
at stake in a fight

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:34.092 position:50% align:center
and you can turn
stress into a tool.

00:10:34.175 --> 00:10:36.803 position:50% align:center
So we should value
life. Channel it.

00:10:36.886 --> 00:10:38.680 position:50% align:center
When you're feeling
alive in that way,

00:10:38.763 --> 00:10:41.391 position:50% align:center
self-defense becomes reflexive.

00:10:41.474 --> 00:10:44.269 position:50% align:center
All right. Let's get
some practice in.

00:10:44.352 --> 00:10:46.938 position:50% align:center
Come at me like I'm
out for your lives.

00:10:51.359 --> 00:10:52.944 position:50% align:center
Ah. So it begins.

00:10:53.028 --> 00:10:54.654 position:50% align:center
[HIKAGE, HINATA]
Kill 'em, Waka!

00:11:00.452 --> 00:11:01.703 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU]
That's enough.

00:11:01.786 --> 00:11:02.787 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
Already?

00:11:02.871 --> 00:11:04.122 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU]
Your technique isn't bad,

00:11:04.205 --> 00:11:06.124 position:50% align:center
but you're not about to hit me.

00:11:06.207 --> 00:11:09.085 position:50% align:center
All of your attacks are
completely predictable.

00:11:09.169 --> 00:11:11.004 position:50% align:center
You need to shake
things up somehow.

00:11:11.087 --> 00:11:13.131 position:50% align:center
And how do I do that?

00:11:13.214 --> 00:11:16.593 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU] Well, I think
you need what I call...

00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:18.261 position:50% align:center
...a finishing move.

00:11:18.345 --> 00:11:19.888 position:50% align:center
Like an ultimate a--

00:11:19.971 --> 00:11:21.556 position:50% align:center
[HINATA, HIKAGE]
Ooh...

00:11:21.639 --> 00:11:24.517 position:50% align:center
That's what happens when
ya let your guard down.

00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:26.061 position:50% align:center
What you need is
a finishing move

00:11:26.144 --> 00:11:28.438 position:50% align:center
that capitalizes on
your speed advantage.

00:11:28.521 --> 00:11:30.607 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Well said, Captain Shinmon.

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:33.568 position:50% align:center
You're not just crazy strong,
you're perceptive.

00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:34.444 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:11:34.527 --> 00:11:36.237 position:50% align:center
Hi. It's nice to meet you.

00:11:36.321 --> 00:11:38.406 position:50% align:center
I'm the head of the 8th's
one-man science team,

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:39.949 position:50% align:center
and I'm here to
crash your party.

00:11:40.033 --> 00:11:41.910 position:50% align:center
My name is Victor Licht.

00:11:41.993 --> 00:11:43.453 position:50% align:center
I've thought of a
way to help Shinra

00:11:43.536 --> 00:11:45.622 position:50% align:center
give himself a power boost.

00:11:47.165 --> 00:11:48.792 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna need help
to demonstrate.

00:11:48.875 --> 00:11:51.419 position:50% align:center
Hey, Captain, could you
help me out for a second?

00:11:51.503 --> 00:11:52.921 position:50% align:center
Depends on what you want.

00:11:53.004 --> 00:11:55.632 position:50% align:center
I wanna show Shinra how
jet propulsion works.

00:11:55.715 --> 00:11:57.092 position:50% align:center
If he can emulate it,
he should get

00:11:57.175 --> 00:12:01.012 position:50% align:center
a lot more burst firepower
outta those feet of his.

00:12:01.096 --> 00:12:03.431 position:50% align:center
If he compresses his
fire as he emits it,

00:12:03.515 --> 00:12:06.851 position:50% align:center
the thrust he gets'll
straight-up skyrocket.

00:12:06.935 --> 00:12:08.895 position:50% align:center
So basically,
you want me to show him

00:12:08.978 --> 00:12:10.313 position:50% align:center
how to tighten a flame?

00:12:10.397 --> 00:12:11.648 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Yes, I do.

00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:15.402 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU]
Will this be enough firepower?

00:12:15.485 --> 00:12:16.820 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Yes, it will.

00:12:27.414 --> 00:12:29.207 position:50% align:center
That was awesome!

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:31.960 position:50% align:center
See, when you fly normally,
your flames get pushed out

00:12:32.043 --> 00:12:34.045 position:50% align:center
in all sorts of
useless directions.

00:12:34.129 --> 00:12:35.797 position:50% align:center
Rein 'em in a bit and
you can take advantage

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:37.924 position:50% align:center
of all that raw power
you've got.

00:12:38.008 --> 00:12:39.843 position:50% align:center
If you can do like the
captain showed you

00:12:39.926 --> 00:12:42.470 position:50% align:center
and condense your flame
so it only shoots one way,

00:12:42.554 --> 00:12:45.348 position:50% align:center
it should increase your
speed by a good margin.

00:12:45.432 --> 00:12:49.102 position:50% align:center
And if I can do that, then
I'll have my ultimate attack.

00:12:59.571 --> 00:13:00.822 position:50% align:center
I want you to focus on making

00:13:00.905 --> 00:13:03.158 position:50% align:center
that finishing move
of yours work, Shinra.

00:13:03.241 --> 00:13:04.492 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Sir!

00:13:04.576 --> 00:13:06.870 position:50% align:center
Arthur, your power is
already a finishing move.

00:13:06.953 --> 00:13:09.622 position:50% align:center
Let's just keep sparring--
work on the basics.

00:13:09.706 --> 00:13:11.041 position:50% align:center
Come try to kill me.

00:13:11.124 --> 00:13:12.375 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
Tch.

00:13:12.459 --> 00:13:15.003 position:50% align:center
All righty then. Let's
watch this cookie crumble.

00:13:15.086 --> 00:13:16.421 position:50% align:center
I have'ta say,

00:13:16.504 --> 00:13:18.923 position:50% align:center
you've got a different air
than the rest of the 8th.

00:13:19.007 --> 00:13:22.218 position:50% align:center
I heard that you were sent
there by Haijima Industries.

00:13:22.302 --> 00:13:23.678 position:50% align:center
A different air, huh?

00:13:23.762 --> 00:13:26.139 position:50% align:center
You tryin' to say I'm
too smart for them?

00:13:26.222 --> 00:13:27.682 position:50% align:center
Too strange.

00:13:27.766 --> 00:13:30.352 position:50% align:center
Try anything funny with them
and I'll dump you in the sea.

00:13:30.435 --> 00:13:34.272 position:50% align:center
Why does everyone think I'm
a traitor? What did I do?

00:13:49.162 --> 00:13:51.247 position:50% align:center
[BOTH giggling]

00:13:51.331 --> 00:13:52.749 position:50% align:center
I fly with my toes.

00:13:52.832 --> 00:13:55.335 position:50% align:center
Fine-tune my positioning
with minor movements.

00:13:55.418 --> 00:13:58.213 position:50% align:center
If I don't pay attention
to that, I lose my balance.

00:13:58.296 --> 00:14:00.006 position:50% align:center
But when I'm trying to
squeeze my flame tighter,

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:03.051 position:50% align:center
I really wanna
scrunch up my feet.

00:14:03.134 --> 00:14:06.513 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR grunting]

00:14:06.596 --> 00:14:08.848 position:50% align:center
Since I haven't even
made it work once yet,

00:14:08.932 --> 00:14:10.308 position:50% align:center
there's no point thinkin'.

00:14:10.392 --> 00:14:11.976 position:50% align:center
Just need to plug on for now.

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:14.187 position:50% align:center
I think he might be
on to something.

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:17.023 position:50% align:center
You can deal with most problems
by saying one of two things.

00:14:17.107 --> 00:14:19.317 position:50% align:center
"Time to give up" or,
"Whatever, just do it."

00:14:19.401 --> 00:14:21.027 position:50% align:center
For a "brilliant" scientist,

00:14:21.111 --> 00:14:23.363 position:50% align:center
that's a real simple
way to think.

00:14:23.446 --> 00:14:25.365 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Eh, sometimes
thinking's pointless.

00:14:25.448 --> 00:14:26.950 position:50% align:center
If you're at the
start line of a race

00:14:27.033 --> 00:14:29.244 position:50% align:center
against rivals you don't know
on a track you've never seen,

00:14:29.327 --> 00:14:30.704 position:50% align:center
ya gotta start runnin'.

00:14:30.787 --> 00:14:32.122 position:50% align:center
The toughest problems are solved

00:14:32.205 --> 00:14:35.208 position:50% align:center
by throwing effort at the wall
and seein' if it breaks.

00:14:35.291 --> 00:14:36.960 position:50% align:center
That's certainly a surprise.

00:14:37.043 --> 00:14:39.879 position:50% align:center
Think we might have something
in common after all.

00:14:42.882 --> 00:14:45.844 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Captain Shinmon has
perfect control of his flames.

00:14:45.927 --> 00:14:48.513 position:50% align:center
How does he do it?

00:14:48.596 --> 00:14:50.807 position:50% align:center
There's got to be some
kind of secret.

00:15:01.276 --> 00:15:03.653 position:50% align:center
[SPUTTER] Sputter, sputter,
sputter, sputter, sputter.

00:15:03.737 --> 00:15:05.739 position:50% align:center
[FLARE] Flare, flare, flare,
flare, flare, flare, flare.

00:15:05.822 --> 00:15:09.034 position:50% align:center
--[SPUTTER] Sputter, sputter...
--[FLARE] Flare, flare...

00:15:09.117 --> 00:15:11.494 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:15:11.578 --> 00:15:13.663 position:50% align:center
I've told you before
and I'll tell you now.

00:15:13.747 --> 00:15:15.999 position:50% align:center
We do not play with fire here.

00:15:16.082 --> 00:15:19.127 position:50% align:center
Now what can I do to
help you remember?

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:20.920 position:50% align:center
[MAKI] It isn't what
it looks like, sir.

00:15:21.004 --> 00:15:24.007 position:50% align:center
Sputter and Flare have an
important mission this time.

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:27.385 position:50% align:center
Has your obsession with fairy
tales finally driven you mad?

00:15:27.469 --> 00:15:29.596 position:50% align:center
She's tellin' you
the truth, Lieutenant.

00:15:29.679 --> 00:15:31.222 position:50% align:center
I made Maki some new equipment

00:15:31.306 --> 00:15:33.892 position:50% align:center
and it needs Sputter
and Flare to operate.

00:15:33.975 --> 00:15:35.226 position:50% align:center
What?

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:38.396 position:50% align:center
I gave the twin hover units
a name. It's Tekkyo.

00:15:41.566 --> 00:15:44.402 position:50% align:center
They use Sputter and Flare
as power sources.

00:15:44.486 --> 00:15:47.822 position:50% align:center
Which means Maki can use her
second-gen powers to move them.

00:15:47.906 --> 00:15:49.657 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA]
What exactly do they do?

00:15:49.741 --> 00:15:51.826 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN] They're pretty
much flying hammers.

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:54.412 position:50% align:center
I know a lot of pyrokinetic
enemies are flame resistant,

00:15:54.496 --> 00:15:56.331 position:50% align:center
so I figured these might help.

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:03.088 position:50% align:center
So what do you think?

00:16:03.171 --> 00:16:05.799 position:50% align:center
I think you three just
passed your flight test.

00:16:05.882 --> 00:16:08.760 position:50% align:center
Then the Sput-flare-witch
is ready for action.

00:16:08.843 --> 00:16:10.679 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that isn't what
we're calling 'em.

00:16:10.762 --> 00:16:12.472 position:50% align:center
The name's Tekkyo.

00:16:13.807 --> 00:16:17.769 position:50% align:center
[IRIS] Many years ago,
mankind faced a divine fury.

00:16:17.852 --> 00:16:20.522 position:50% align:center
In an event is known as
the "Day of the Cataclysm,"

00:16:20.605 --> 00:16:22.982 position:50% align:center
our world was bathed in fire.

00:16:23.066 --> 00:16:24.651 position:50% align:center
The fire raged with an intensity

00:16:24.734 --> 00:16:27.153 position:50% align:center
that threatened to reduce
mankind to ash.

00:16:27.237 --> 00:16:29.614 position:50% align:center
The places they lived,
the languages they spoke,

00:16:29.698 --> 00:16:30.990 position:50% align:center
the culture they had built--

00:16:31.074 --> 00:16:32.242 position:50% align:center
none could escape it.

00:16:32.325 --> 00:16:34.828 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Come on! Tighten up!

00:16:34.911 --> 00:16:38.790 position:50% align:center
I got plenty of fire,
I just need to pinch it!

00:16:44.546 --> 00:16:46.506 position:50% align:center
[HIKAGE] Your flames
haven't changed at all!

00:16:46.589 --> 00:16:49.342 position:50% align:center
[HINATA] Like all you can do
is switch between gross faces.

00:16:49.426 --> 00:16:51.803 position:50% align:center
What? Was the face
I made that weird?

00:16:51.886 --> 00:16:53.763 position:50% align:center
If by weird you mean
disgusting, sure.

00:16:53.847 --> 00:16:56.016 position:50% align:center
The fugliest pucker
face I've seen.

00:16:56.099 --> 00:16:58.518 position:50% align:center
Guess this gesture
won't work either then.

00:16:58.601 --> 00:17:01.479 position:50% align:center
I could try the one that
Captain Obi likes to do.

00:17:01.563 --> 00:17:04.482 position:50% align:center
Rock and roll! Yeah!

00:17:06.776 --> 00:17:08.111 position:50% align:center
The hell was that?

00:17:08.194 --> 00:17:11.072 position:50% align:center
Did Shinra just rip a huge
fart through his feet?

00:17:11.156 --> 00:17:12.490 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Eh?

00:17:12.574 --> 00:17:13.950 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.787 position:50% align:center
Now it's you who's
not on guard!

00:17:17.871 --> 00:17:20.957 position:50% align:center
Doesn't count as a sneak
attack if you announce it.

00:17:22.792 --> 00:17:23.918 position:50% align:center
Good try though.

00:17:24.002 --> 00:17:25.712 position:50% align:center
You've got your head
in the right place now.

00:17:25.795 --> 00:17:27.464 position:50% align:center
Think he's dead.

00:17:27.547 --> 00:17:30.216 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU] Shinra, show
me what you're doing.

00:17:31.301 --> 00:17:32.969 position:50% align:center
I saw you make gestures
with your hands

00:17:33.053 --> 00:17:34.429 position:50% align:center
when you powered up your flames,

00:17:34.512 --> 00:17:36.890 position:50% align:center
so I thought I'd try
it out for myself.

00:17:36.973 --> 00:17:39.309 position:50% align:center
I got the last one I tried
from Captain Obi.

00:17:39.392 --> 00:17:40.602 position:50% align:center
And, I don't know,

00:17:40.685 --> 00:17:43.980 position:50% align:center
I feel like this one
might've done something.

00:17:44.064 --> 00:17:46.816 position:50% align:center
Hell yeah!

00:17:50.236 --> 00:17:51.738 position:50% align:center
No dice.

00:17:51.821 --> 00:17:54.199 position:50% align:center
Take off your gloves so I can
see what you're trying to do.

00:17:54.282 --> 00:17:56.242 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Yes, sir.

00:17:56.326 --> 00:18:00.372 position:50% align:center
You saw me using hand forms,
which are also known as Kata.

00:18:00.455 --> 00:18:03.667 position:50% align:center
They were commonly used by the
martial artists of old Japan.

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:05.210 position:50% align:center
There are many.

00:18:05.293 --> 00:18:08.129 position:50% align:center
I usually use this one
to control my fire.

00:18:08.213 --> 00:18:09.756 position:50% align:center
But every single
one of these Kata

00:18:09.839 --> 00:18:12.092 position:50% align:center
is meant to have
a different effect.

00:18:12.175 --> 00:18:14.969 position:50% align:center
There's even one that channels
power to the user's feet.

00:18:15.053 --> 00:18:16.721 position:50% align:center
It's called Tiger Crusher.

00:18:16.805 --> 00:18:18.223 position:50% align:center
Watch closely.

00:18:19.724 --> 00:18:22.060 position:50% align:center
Put your index finger
on the base of your thumb,

00:18:22.143 --> 00:18:23.228 position:50% align:center
and bend your thumb,

00:18:23.311 --> 00:18:25.438 position:50% align:center
pushing it towards
the base of your pinky.

00:18:27.065 --> 00:18:28.483 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU]
By using these Kata,

00:18:28.566 --> 00:18:30.485 position:50% align:center
you can channel your
energy, or "ki,"

00:18:30.568 --> 00:18:32.529 position:50% align:center
into certain parts of your body.

00:18:32.612 --> 00:18:35.031 position:50% align:center
This also affects your flames.

00:18:35.115 --> 00:18:37.909 position:50% align:center
Amazing. I had no idea.

00:18:37.992 --> 00:18:40.245 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Good luck.

00:18:40.328 --> 00:18:42.247 position:50% align:center
Thank you for the help, sir!

00:18:43.998 --> 00:18:47.335 position:50% align:center
We've got more training
to do. Up and at 'em.

00:18:47.419 --> 00:18:48.503 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR groans]

00:18:51.006 --> 00:18:54.426 position:50% align:center
So I bend both my index
finger and thumb inward.

00:18:54.509 --> 00:18:57.846 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Focus on channeling
energy into my feet.

00:19:08.398 --> 00:19:11.234 position:50% align:center
I think that was it.
My fire compressed.

00:19:11.317 --> 00:19:13.903 position:50% align:center
I was about to blast
off like a rocket.

00:19:13.987 --> 00:19:16.281 position:50% align:center
The Tiger Crusher's amazing.

00:19:19.451 --> 00:19:21.953 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
So this is how my power works.

00:19:22.037 --> 00:19:24.706 position:50% align:center
By channeling the flow
of my body's energy,

00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:27.042 position:50% align:center
I can master my flames.

00:19:31.921 --> 00:19:34.966 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
I feel the heat in my feet.

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:36.885 position:50% align:center
The shape of my hand...

00:19:36.968 --> 00:19:39.095 position:50% align:center
...pushes all my strength down.

00:19:40.555 --> 00:19:42.223 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Sho needs my help.

00:19:42.307 --> 00:19:45.310 position:50% align:center
I need to reach him
as fast as possible.

00:19:45.393 --> 00:19:46.936 position:50% align:center
Faster.

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:48.271 position:50% align:center
Faster!

00:19:55.820 --> 00:20:00.617 position:50% align:center
Okay. I think I see what
Joker sees in you now.

00:20:01.951 --> 00:20:04.412 position:50% align:center
Pretty impressive.

00:20:04.496 --> 00:20:07.248 position:50% align:center
Hey. I'll give ya credit
for being quiet that time.

00:20:07.332 --> 00:20:11.336 position:50% align:center
Shinra! Use that speed boost
to come after me now!

00:20:16.466 --> 00:20:18.343 position:50% align:center
Beni was really dreading this.

00:20:18.426 --> 00:20:20.553 position:50% align:center
I'm glad to see
he's having fun now.

00:20:20.637 --> 00:20:24.265 position:50% align:center
Is he? It's hard to tell
from looking at his face.

00:20:25.475 --> 00:20:29.437 position:50% align:center
Two fighters who're worth
training have come his way.

00:20:29.521 --> 00:20:32.565 position:50% align:center
I bet you Beni's
ecstatic right now.

00:20:34.984 --> 00:20:37.237 position:50% align:center
A true knight...
never surrenders.

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:39.864 position:50% align:center
It looks like your
friend's pretty worn out.

00:20:39.948 --> 00:20:42.075 position:50% align:center
Think we better call it a day.

00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:46.454 position:50% align:center
It looked like you got knocked
around a lot. You good?

00:20:46.538 --> 00:20:48.707 position:50% align:center
Of course.
Knights are resilient.

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:49.916 position:50% align:center
So tell me,

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.876 position:50% align:center
d'ya have a name for
that new finishing move?

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:53.461 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah! My ultimate attack!

00:20:53.545 --> 00:20:54.671 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU]
Stay sharp.

00:20:58.258 --> 00:21:00.635 position:50% align:center
So, what's this move
of yours called?

00:21:00.719 --> 00:21:01.511 position:50% align:center
The Kicker-Man Ki--

00:21:01.594 --> 00:21:03.054 position:50% align:center
Overruled.

00:21:14.691 --> 00:21:18.570 position:50% align:center
[HIKAGE, HINATA giggling]

00:21:22.532 --> 00:21:24.909 position:50% align:center
Whaddaya think? They any good?

00:21:27.871 --> 00:21:31.124 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU] Yeah, but they're
still just a couple kids.

00:21:31.207 --> 00:21:33.168 position:50% align:center
[BOTH groan]

00:21:33.251 --> 00:21:35.503 position:50% align:center
Too shaky for their own good.

00:21:47.182 --> 00:21:50.352 position:50% align:center
We'll make a proto-nationalist
swordsman of you yet, kid.

00:21:50.435 --> 00:21:52.687 position:50% align:center
That single-edged
blade isn't like yours.

00:21:52.771 --> 00:21:54.397 position:50% align:center
It works differently.

00:21:54.481 --> 00:21:56.066 position:50% align:center
Its own technique.

00:21:56.149 --> 00:21:58.360 position:50% align:center
But it never hurts
to learn, right?

00:22:07.619 --> 00:22:09.537 position:50% align:center
Okay. You did good.

00:22:09.621 --> 00:22:11.956 position:50% align:center
Would've hit me
if I hadn't known.

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:13.124 position:50% align:center
Use it wisely.

00:22:13.208 --> 00:22:14.959 position:50% align:center
Sir!

00:22:15.043 --> 00:22:17.087 position:50% align:center
I heard about your
brother, Sho.

00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:19.673 position:50% align:center
How he's the only
family you have.

00:22:19.756 --> 00:22:20.965 position:50% align:center
Keep him safe, okay?

00:22:21.049 --> 00:22:23.426 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Thank you, sir. Will do.

00:22:25.136 --> 00:22:27.055 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
I'm coming, Sho.

00:22:28.014 --> 00:22:29.182 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Huh?
