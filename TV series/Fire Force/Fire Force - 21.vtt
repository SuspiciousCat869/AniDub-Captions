00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:40.123 position:50% align:center
Lisa. Stop.

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:46.755 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI chuckles]

00:00:46.838 --> 00:00:49.132 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] How can you
possibly expect to beat us

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:51.718 position:50% align:center
when you have no
powers to speak of?

00:00:51.801 --> 00:00:53.928 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
You don't have to do this, Lisa.

00:00:54.012 --> 00:00:56.806 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] Due to the plague
that is human combustion,

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.144 position:50% align:center
weak men like you live and die
at the mercy of the flames.

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:05.648 position:50% align:center
But through Lisa's compatibility
with the bugs...

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:08.860 position:50% align:center
...she's kindled the
flames within herself.

00:01:08.943 --> 00:01:10.362 position:50% align:center
Both of my parents were killed

00:01:10.445 --> 00:01:13.281 position:50% align:center
during a fire that was
caused by an Infernal.

00:01:13.365 --> 00:01:15.158 position:50% align:center
After that, I lived in terror.

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:19.371 position:50% align:center
Until the bug awakened my power
and drove my fear away.

00:01:19.454 --> 00:01:21.373 position:50% align:center
These guys are
lying to you, Lisa!

00:01:21.456 --> 00:01:24.959 position:50% align:center
[OBI] I don't have any more
powers than you did as a kid,

00:01:25.043 --> 00:01:26.378 position:50% align:center
and as a Fire Soldier,

00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:29.631 position:50% align:center
I know the terror of the
flames as well as anyone.

00:01:29.714 --> 00:01:31.925 position:50% align:center
I face it every day!

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:37.764 position:50% align:center
[OBI] Seems to me that Giovanni
wants you to be scared.

00:01:37.847 --> 00:01:39.891 position:50% align:center
He's using your fear
to control you!

00:01:39.974 --> 00:01:42.936 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] You accuse me as
you brandish an axe at her.

00:01:43.019 --> 00:01:44.979 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
The axe is for you.

00:01:46.856 --> 00:01:48.817 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
He doesn't care about you, Lisa!

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.819 position:50% align:center
You have no reason
to protect him!

00:01:50.902 --> 00:01:52.821 position:50% align:center
The flaming tentacles
which envelop me

00:01:52.904 --> 00:01:55.490 position:50% align:center
are magnetically attuned
so they move to protect me

00:01:55.573 --> 00:01:57.492 position:50% align:center
of their own accord.

00:01:57.575 --> 00:02:01.246 position:50% align:center
The flames I used to live in
fear of... now keep me safe.

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:04.499 position:50% align:center
What kind of bug is able
to give people powers like that?

00:02:04.582 --> 00:02:06.334 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:02:06.418 --> 00:02:09.546 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
Would you like to know?

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.716 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm not telling!

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:16.136 position:50% align:center
You'll leave this world just as
ignorant as you were coming in!

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:18.763 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
You are one annoying old man!

00:02:20.515 --> 00:02:22.976 position:50% align:center
Did you actually believe that
you could put out my fire

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:25.645 position:50% align:center
with a toy like that?

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:27.564 position:50% align:center
I don't think it's
gonna work, Captain!

00:02:27.647 --> 00:02:29.482 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
We'll see about that!

00:02:31.192 --> 00:02:34.195 position:50% align:center
It seems like this fight
is a joke to you.

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:36.406 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
It's not. I promise.

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.199 position:50% align:center
I'm trying my hardest
to save you

00:02:38.283 --> 00:02:40.243 position:50% align:center
from the flames that
hold you captive,

00:02:40.326 --> 00:02:41.244 position:50% align:center
so hang in there!

00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:43.121 position:50% align:center
I am not their captive!

00:02:43.204 --> 00:02:45.123 position:50% align:center
[OBI] If those feelers
are defending you,

00:02:45.206 --> 00:02:46.541 position:50% align:center
why do you look so scared?

00:02:46.624 --> 00:02:49.169 position:50% align:center
I'm not scared,
but you should be!

00:02:51.796 --> 00:02:53.548 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
I'm not fighting you.

00:02:53.631 --> 00:02:55.425 position:50% align:center
I'm fighting a fire.

00:02:58.053 --> 00:03:00.221 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
Fire extinguishers have no place

00:03:00.305 --> 00:03:01.723 position:50% align:center
on the field of battle.

00:03:01.806 --> 00:03:05.018 position:50% align:center
You truly are a fool.

00:03:05.101 --> 00:03:06.269 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
You've forgotten,

00:03:06.353 --> 00:03:08.730 position:50% align:center
but there's a motto we
Fire Soldiers live by:

00:03:08.813 --> 00:03:11.983 position:50% align:center
"Protect human
life and property."

00:03:12.067 --> 00:03:14.027 position:50% align:center
This piece of gear
might not be flashy,

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.404 position:50% align:center
but it does its job every time.

00:03:16.488 --> 00:03:19.240 position:50% align:center
It's saved more lives
than I can count!

00:03:21.493 --> 00:03:22.369 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
Kill them.

00:03:22.452 --> 00:03:24.120 position:50% align:center
Yes. Right.

00:03:25.622 --> 00:03:27.999 position:50% align:center
Your naivety will be
the death of you.

00:03:28.083 --> 00:03:30.835 position:50% align:center
Tell me, how do you plan to
keep saving people's lives

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:32.796 position:50% align:center
when you've thrown
your own away?

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:36.591 position:50% align:center
[OBI] Believe it or not,
I'm very protective of my life.

00:03:36.675 --> 00:03:39.302 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry for making
you wait, Lisa,

00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:41.721 position:50% align:center
but everything's in place now.

00:03:46.101 --> 00:03:47.268 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
Obi.

00:03:47.352 --> 00:03:49.062 position:50% align:center
You took all those
hits on purpose

00:03:49.145 --> 00:03:53.066 position:50% align:center
so you could place extinguisher
grenades beneath her tentacles.

00:03:58.071 --> 00:03:59.948 position:50% align:center
[LISA]
I'm falling!

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.705 position:50% align:center
[LISA]
I've lost everything. Everyone.

00:04:06.788 --> 00:04:09.958 position:50% align:center
Mom. Dad.

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:24.764 position:50% align:center
Vulcan.

00:04:29.644 --> 00:04:32.605 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] You haven't
forgotten what you are again,

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:35.400 position:50% align:center
have you, Feeler?

00:05:00.675 --> 00:05:02.635 position:50% align:center
<i>take what you got and leave now</i>

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:04.804 position:50% align:center

00:05:04.888 --> 00:05:08.558 position:50% align:center

00:05:08.641 --> 00:05:10.602 position:50% align:center

00:05:10.685 --> 00:05:12.729 position:50% align:center

00:05:12.812 --> 00:05:16.441 position:50% align:center

<i>he wants you, don't you?</i>

00:05:16.524 --> 00:05:20.487 position:50% align:center
<i>you're crooked desire</i>
<i>left us in disarray</i>

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:24.449 position:50% align:center
<i>misguided, divided</i>
<i>at the point of no return</i>

<i>MAYDAY</i>

00:06:05.115 --> 00:06:09.911 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
Feeler...

00:06:09.994 --> 00:06:13.832 position:50% align:center
It was I who saved you
from the fear of the flames.

00:06:13.915 --> 00:06:15.834 position:50% align:center
I who gave you purpose.

00:06:15.917 --> 00:06:19.254 position:50% align:center
Vulcan never would've given
you a home if not for me.

00:06:19.337 --> 00:06:22.382 position:50% align:center
You'd best remember
the debt you owe.

00:06:22.465 --> 00:06:24.384 position:50% align:center
Come back here.

00:06:25.468 --> 00:06:27.387 position:50% align:center
Don't do this.

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.431 position:50% align:center
I have to, though.

00:06:29.514 --> 00:06:31.641 position:50% align:center
Back when I had
absolutely nothing,

00:06:31.725 --> 00:06:34.811 position:50% align:center
Doctor Giovanni came
and rescued me.

00:06:34.894 --> 00:06:36.938 position:50% align:center
I can't leave him now.

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:42.152 position:50% align:center
Just try to forget
we ever met, okay?

00:06:43.653 --> 00:06:44.738 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:45.864 --> 00:06:47.407 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
Damn you!

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:48.658 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
Take one more step

00:06:48.742 --> 00:06:51.911 position:50% align:center
and I'll burn through
her neck with this wire.

00:06:51.995 --> 00:06:53.413 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
No, don't!

00:06:57.292 --> 00:06:58.918 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
Listen well, Vulcan.

00:06:59.002 --> 00:07:03.340 position:50% align:center
If you want to save her life,
you'll do exactly as I say.

00:07:03.423 --> 00:07:06.593 position:50% align:center
Pick up that gun and shoot Obi.

00:07:06.676 --> 00:07:10.055 position:50% align:center
You really are a rotten
bastard to the core.

00:07:11.056 --> 00:07:13.141 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
You should rejoice, Feeler.

00:07:13.224 --> 00:07:14.768 position:50% align:center
Your life is being put to use

00:07:14.851 --> 00:07:17.729 position:50% align:center
in the service of the
Evangelist right now.

00:07:17.812 --> 00:07:20.190 position:50% align:center
Isn't that what you want?

00:07:21.316 --> 00:07:23.568 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Vulcan, do as he says.

00:07:23.651 --> 00:07:24.903 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:33.578 --> 00:07:34.954 position:50% align:center
Sorry, sir.

00:07:35.038 --> 00:07:36.873 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
This isn't your fault.

00:07:36.956 --> 00:07:40.669 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] No more stalling.
Act now, or else.

00:07:40.752 --> 00:07:43.296 position:50% align:center
There's no point in making
a big production out of it.

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.298 position:50% align:center
Just do as I say.

00:07:45.382 --> 00:07:47.175 position:50% align:center
Shoot and Feeler will live.

00:07:47.258 --> 00:07:49.594 position:50% align:center
Don't and Lisa will die.

00:07:49.678 --> 00:07:51.179 position:50% align:center
That's all there is to it.

00:07:51.262 --> 00:07:53.807 position:50% align:center
I swear I'm gonna
kill you, Giovanni!

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:55.642 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
Are you?

00:07:55.725 --> 00:07:57.185 position:50% align:center
Well, before you do,
you can watch

00:07:57.268 --> 00:08:01.022 position:50% align:center
as my heating wire lops
off this poor girl's head.

00:08:01.106 --> 00:08:03.358 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Go ahead. Pull the trigger!

00:08:03.441 --> 00:08:06.111 position:50% align:center
It's the only way
you can save Lisa!

00:08:09.155 --> 00:08:10.615 position:50% align:center
I can't do it.

00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:12.534 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
Then Lisa is finished.

00:08:12.617 --> 00:08:14.411 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Do it, Vulcan! Shoot me!

00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:16.037 position:50% align:center
If you don't, he'll kill Lisa!

00:08:16.121 --> 00:08:18.081 position:50% align:center
But if I give in, then--

00:08:22.043 --> 00:08:24.462 position:50% align:center
God dammit! Ah!

00:08:31.636 --> 00:08:33.888 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI chuckles]

00:08:33.972 --> 00:08:35.306 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
You killed your captain

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:39.269 position:50% align:center
and your only chance of winning
just to save this girl.

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.983 position:50% align:center
[LISA coughing]

00:08:45.066 --> 00:08:48.319 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
Lisa. Captain.

00:08:48.403 --> 00:08:52.032 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI laughing]

00:08:52.115 --> 00:08:53.199 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:53.283 --> 00:08:55.660 position:50% align:center
Even knowing I'd be fine,
that was scary!

00:08:55.744 --> 00:08:58.663 position:50% align:center
Giovanni!

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:03.877 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] That turnout coat
isn't made to be bulletproof.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.880 position:50% align:center
So what extra protection
did you have?

00:09:06.963 --> 00:09:08.256 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:10.383 position:50% align:center
Oh, would you like to know?

00:09:10.467 --> 00:09:12.844 position:50% align:center
Huh? Ya feelin' curious?

00:09:12.927 --> 00:09:14.596 position:50% align:center
Well...

00:09:14.679 --> 00:09:16.264 position:50% align:center
--...I'm not gonna tell you!
--I gave him a special ballistic

00:09:16.348 --> 00:09:18.141 position:50% align:center
vest before we came.

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:20.268 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:09:20.352 --> 00:09:22.771 position:50% align:center
I'm workin' as the
8th's engineer now!

00:09:22.854 --> 00:09:24.647 position:50% align:center
There's no way I'm
gonna let my captain

00:09:24.731 --> 00:09:26.232 position:50% align:center
fight without protection.

00:09:26.316 --> 00:09:29.486 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] Even so,
that was a reckless ploy.

00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:31.196 position:50% align:center
It's the trust we
put into each other

00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:33.948 position:50% align:center
that makes the members
of Company 8 a real team.

00:09:34.032 --> 00:09:37.994 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] Trust. What an
absurd, inexplicable concept!

00:09:38.078 --> 00:09:40.622 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN] Your hardware's
a disorganized mess.

00:09:40.705 --> 00:09:42.791 position:50% align:center
You're lucky that Pop
isn't here to see it.

00:09:42.874 --> 00:09:46.002 position:50% align:center
Get ready, dirtbag.
Equip penguin-met!

00:09:49.506 --> 00:09:51.091 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN] Let's see if
that machinery of yours

00:09:51.174 --> 00:09:53.343 position:50% align:center
can pass a strength test!

00:10:01.768 --> 00:10:03.770 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI groans]

00:10:04.813 --> 00:10:07.023 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN] Your hardware's
as weak as it looks!

00:10:07.107 --> 00:10:09.192 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:10:09.275 --> 00:10:10.568 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
Lisa!

00:10:14.989 --> 00:10:15.949 position:50% align:center
Lisa.

00:10:16.032 --> 00:10:17.826 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Good work. I'll take over!

00:10:17.909 --> 00:10:20.120 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
Considering your lack of powers,

00:10:20.203 --> 00:10:22.747 position:50% align:center
you're managing quite well.

00:10:22.831 --> 00:10:25.291 position:50% align:center
[OBI] You used to be
a Fire Soldier like me.

00:10:25.375 --> 00:10:27.919 position:50% align:center
You were meant to protect
people from the flames.

00:10:28.003 --> 00:10:29.421 position:50% align:center
Why would you go
from saving people

00:10:29.504 --> 00:10:31.589 position:50% align:center
to turning them into Infernals?

00:10:31.673 --> 00:10:34.217 position:50% align:center
What does your Evangelist
hope to accomplish

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.052 position:50% align:center
by spreading so much terror?

00:10:36.136 --> 00:10:39.180 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] Earlier, you told me
that the Fire Soldier's maxim

00:10:39.264 --> 00:10:42.851 position:50% align:center
was to protect human life
and property, did you not?

00:10:42.934 --> 00:10:47.188 position:50% align:center
Tell me, can you really not see
how trivial such things are?

00:10:47.272 --> 00:10:50.567 position:50% align:center
Humans are such a small portion
of the Earth's energy.

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:54.237 position:50% align:center
We are vermin scuttling
across the planet's crust.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.406 position:50% align:center
Of course mankind should burn.

00:10:56.489 --> 00:10:59.367 position:50% align:center
It's the only way to become
part of something greater!

00:10:59.451 --> 00:11:00.577 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
What a load of crap!

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:02.954 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
About 250 years ago,

00:11:03.038 --> 00:11:07.417 position:50% align:center
this planet's surface was torn
apart by the Great Cataclysm.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:10.378 position:50% align:center
This catastrophe was caused
by the sudden release

00:11:10.462 --> 00:11:12.297 position:50% align:center
of an immense Adolla Burst.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:16.593 position:50% align:center
And the place that Adolla Burst
came from is one you know.

00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:20.597 position:50% align:center
It's a place you believe in,
if you have faith.

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:23.683 position:50% align:center
Long before the Solar
calendar began,

00:11:23.767 --> 00:11:27.896 position:50% align:center
before the Great Cataclysm,
since time immemorial,

00:11:27.979 --> 00:11:32.108 position:50% align:center
humankind has lived in
perpetual fear of this place.

00:11:32.192 --> 00:11:35.487 position:50% align:center
[OBI] Regardless of what causes
spontaneous human combustion,

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:37.822 position:50% align:center
I'll do my damnedest to stop it.

00:11:37.906 --> 00:11:41.159 position:50% align:center
You still haven't made a case
for burning people alive.

00:11:41.242 --> 00:11:43.078 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
Spontaneous human combustion

00:11:43.161 --> 00:11:45.246 position:50% align:center
is a part of the natural order.

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:48.041 position:50% align:center
Would you defy
the laws of nature?

00:11:48.124 --> 00:11:51.378 position:50% align:center
[OBI] The bugs you use
are made by people!

00:11:51.461 --> 00:11:52.629 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:57.133 --> 00:11:59.511 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] Do you earnestly
believe that the Evangelist

00:11:59.594 --> 00:12:01.763 position:50% align:center
is no more than
a regular person?

00:12:01.846 --> 00:12:04.641 position:50% align:center
[OBI] It doesn't matter what
the Evangelist really is.

00:12:04.724 --> 00:12:06.851 position:50% align:center
Your cult wanted an
idol to worship,

00:12:06.935 --> 00:12:09.229 position:50% align:center
so you propped one
up for yourselves.

00:12:09.312 --> 00:12:12.524 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] Honestly.
What a ridiculous notion.

00:12:12.607 --> 00:12:14.943 position:50% align:center
You say that we worship an idol?

00:12:15.026 --> 00:12:19.155 position:50% align:center
Then what's the great sun
god of the Holy Sol Temple?

00:12:19.239 --> 00:12:21.658 position:50% align:center
Why bother offering prayers
that you don't know

00:12:21.741 --> 00:12:24.994 position:50% align:center
will be answered to a god
that you don't know exists?

00:12:25.078 --> 00:12:26.871 position:50% align:center
[OBI] Yeah, well,
at least the Temple

00:12:26.955 --> 00:12:29.374 position:50% align:center
doesn't go around
roasting people.

00:12:29.457 --> 00:12:34.004 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
The Evangelist is no mere idol.

00:12:34.087 --> 00:12:36.006 position:50% align:center
A powerless man such as yourself

00:12:36.089 --> 00:12:39.217 position:50% align:center
cannot comprehend
what the Evangelist is.

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:41.886 position:50% align:center
But that truth is likely
beginning to dawn

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:43.346 position:50% align:center
on your soldier.

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:46.057 position:50% align:center
Shinra Kusakabe.

00:12:59.863 --> 00:13:02.907 position:50% align:center
You good, Shinra? Talk to me.

00:13:29.351 --> 00:13:31.936 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Where am I?

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:33.563 position:50% align:center
What is this?

00:13:45.617 --> 00:13:48.912 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Who... are you?

00:13:51.706 --> 00:13:52.999 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA'S MOTHER]
Shinra!

00:14:09.891 --> 00:14:11.351 position:50% align:center
Sho.

00:14:32.789 --> 00:14:34.332 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Shinra?

00:14:34.416 --> 00:14:37.043 position:50% align:center
You okay? What happened?

00:14:37.127 --> 00:14:40.005 position:50% align:center
I, uh-- I don't know.

00:14:40.088 --> 00:14:41.214 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:43.425 --> 00:14:46.469 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
The Devil's Footprints.

00:14:46.553 --> 00:14:49.806 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] What's the matter?
Do you see something?

00:14:55.103 --> 00:14:57.981 position:50% align:center
It's Sho. He's up ahead.

00:14:58.064 --> 00:14:59.482 position:50% align:center
Waiting.

00:15:03.361 --> 00:15:06.948 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] As we speak,
Shinra Kusakabe's Adolla Burst

00:15:07.032 --> 00:15:11.036 position:50% align:center
will be getting stronger through
his link with Commander Sho.

00:15:11.119 --> 00:15:14.873 position:50% align:center
[OBI] Link? How exactly
are they connected?

00:15:14.956 --> 00:15:17.083 position:50% align:center
What is an Adolla Burst really?

00:15:17.167 --> 00:15:20.128 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] It is a special
flame belonging to those

00:15:20.211 --> 00:15:22.964 position:50% align:center
who have become more
than pyrokinetics.

00:15:23.048 --> 00:15:24.966 position:50% align:center
It affects all forms of heat.

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:29.012 position:50% align:center
And it's the spark from
which Infernals spring.

00:15:29.095 --> 00:15:31.348 position:50% align:center
[OBI] You're saying that an
Adolla Burst like Shinra's

00:15:31.431 --> 00:15:32.766 position:50% align:center
are what make Infernals?

00:15:32.849 --> 00:15:34.976 position:50% align:center
Then what are those
bugs you people use?

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:38.063 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] You wish to
know how they relate.

00:15:38.146 --> 00:15:41.399 position:50% align:center
Insects took a drastically
different evolutionary path

00:15:41.483 --> 00:15:44.569 position:50% align:center
than the rest of
the animal kingdom.

00:15:44.652 --> 00:15:48.114 position:50% align:center
Which begs the question:
Where do bugs come from?

00:15:48.198 --> 00:15:52.744 position:50% align:center
Some say it's the same
place as the Adolla Burst.

00:15:52.827 --> 00:15:55.372 position:50% align:center
"Like moths to a flame."

00:15:55.455 --> 00:15:58.333 position:50% align:center
Perhaps every burnt
insect is a child

00:15:58.416 --> 00:16:00.960 position:50% align:center
who tried to find its mother.

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:15.016 position:50% align:center
So you came after all,
Shinra Kusakabe.

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:18.603 position:50% align:center
Yeah! I came here
to keep my promise.

00:16:18.687 --> 00:16:21.898 position:50% align:center
[SHO] You say you made
a vow, knave? To whom?

00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:25.151 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] To Mom.
The woman who loved us both.

00:16:25.235 --> 00:16:27.821 position:50% align:center
[SHO] I have but one
mother figure in my life,

00:16:27.904 --> 00:16:30.407 position:50% align:center
and that is the Evangelist.

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:33.660 position:50% align:center
The thought that you're my
brother turns my stomach.

00:16:33.743 --> 00:16:34.828 position:50% align:center
How can that be?

00:16:34.911 --> 00:16:38.206 position:50% align:center
I was not born from
some filthy womb.

00:16:53.722 --> 00:16:56.766 position:50% align:center
Don't talk about Mom like that.

00:16:56.850 --> 00:17:00.937 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] I'm about to watch two
Adolla Bursts go flame to flame.

00:17:01.021 --> 00:17:02.731 position:50% align:center
This is awesome!

00:17:20.915 --> 00:17:22.792 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:17:45.231 --> 00:17:48.151 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:48.234 --> 00:17:51.279 position:50% align:center
[chuckles nervously]

00:17:54.115 --> 00:17:57.369 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Here I was hoping
we could catch up a bit.

00:18:22.352 --> 00:18:24.396 position:50% align:center
You saw that, too.

00:18:59.055 --> 00:19:01.099 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
That wasn't just fast.

00:19:01.182 --> 00:19:03.101 position:50% align:center
It was like he stopped time.

00:19:03.184 --> 00:19:05.687 position:50% align:center
How can a pyrokinetic do that?

00:19:26.041 --> 00:19:28.960 position:50% align:center
[MAKI]
Hey! Captain? Lieutenant Hinawa?

00:19:29.044 --> 00:19:30.253 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Maki!

00:19:30.337 --> 00:19:31.671 position:50% align:center
[MAKI]
Found you!

00:19:31.755 --> 00:19:34.007 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
This lesson is over.

00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:35.258 position:50% align:center
[OBI grunts]

00:19:35.342 --> 00:19:37.344 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] My task was
to get Shinra Kusakabe

00:19:37.427 --> 00:19:38.928 position:50% align:center
to Commander Sho.

00:19:39.012 --> 00:19:41.765 position:50% align:center
Now that this objective
has been accomplished,

00:19:41.848 --> 00:19:45.060 position:50% align:center
I have no need to stall
for any more time.

00:19:45.143 --> 00:19:48.772 position:50% align:center
All is in accordance with
the will of the Evangelist.

00:19:48.855 --> 00:19:50.231 position:50% align:center
Hold it!

00:19:53.443 --> 00:19:54.986 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
So Adolla Bursts are the cause

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:57.197 position:50% align:center
of human combustion, huh?

00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:00.450 position:50% align:center
What the hell is happening
to the world right now?

00:20:02.619 --> 00:20:04.704 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
Yeah, just keep walkin'!

00:20:04.788 --> 00:20:07.082 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
I'll leave Lisa with you.

00:20:07.165 --> 00:20:10.001 position:50% align:center
But you will never reverse
her conditioning.

00:20:10.085 --> 00:20:11.836 position:50% align:center
Please don't leave me behind.

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:15.340 position:50% align:center
I'll do anything you
tell me to. I'll be good.

00:20:15.423 --> 00:20:16.925 position:50% align:center
Lisa.

00:20:18.009 --> 00:20:21.971 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
Faith. Religion. Brainwashing.

00:20:22.055 --> 00:20:25.809 position:50% align:center
The ailments mankind
could never cure.

00:20:28.478 --> 00:20:30.522 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
Farewell.

00:20:32.857 --> 00:20:35.610 position:50% align:center
It doesn't matter how
swiftly you can move,

00:20:35.694 --> 00:20:38.238 position:50% align:center
you will never be able
to match me, knave.

00:20:38.321 --> 00:20:42.158 position:50% align:center
The fact is that you and I exist
in two separate universes.

00:20:42.242 --> 00:20:43.410 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Universes?

00:20:43.493 --> 00:20:46.287 position:50% align:center
Hold on. What're you saying?

00:20:46.371 --> 00:20:48.415 position:50% align:center
That you're on a
different level than me?

00:20:48.498 --> 00:20:50.917 position:50% align:center
So you think I should
just give up?

00:20:51.001 --> 00:20:52.168 position:50% align:center
I'm takin' you home

00:20:52.252 --> 00:20:54.838 position:50% align:center
if I have to drag you
kicking and screaming!

00:21:12.856 --> 00:21:13.982 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:16.401 --> 00:21:18.069 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
That steam.

00:21:21.281 --> 00:21:24.159 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] You play tag
kinda rough, little bro.

00:21:26.244 --> 00:21:29.205 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Universes. Time. Freezing.

00:21:29.289 --> 00:21:33.251 position:50% align:center
If he's engaging enough heat to
expand the whole universe...

00:21:33.335 --> 00:21:36.254 position:50% align:center
No. That can't be.

00:21:37.505 --> 00:21:39.883 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Even if he is
a third generation,

00:21:39.966 --> 00:21:42.427 position:50% align:center
is that kind of thing
really possible?

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:44.346 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Shinra! We need to run!

00:21:44.429 --> 00:21:46.306 position:50% align:center
I'm serious. You don't
stand a chance here!

00:21:46.389 --> 00:21:48.058 position:50% align:center
His power's too much!

00:21:48.141 --> 00:21:52.062 position:50% align:center
Huh? Then have you figured
out how his power works?

00:21:52.145 --> 00:21:55.231 position:50% align:center
[SHO] You can move as fast
as you want in your universe.

00:21:55.315 --> 00:21:57.275 position:50% align:center
That's meaningless to me.

00:21:57.359 --> 00:22:00.779 position:50% align:center
