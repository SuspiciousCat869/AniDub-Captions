00:00:27.277 --> 00:00:29.654 position:50% align:center
[IRIS] Raffles saw at once
that the Unsullied Flame

00:00:29.738 --> 00:00:31.614 position:50% align:center
was a gift from the great Sol.

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:34.159 position:50% align:center
He resolved to harness
its power with technology

00:00:34.242 --> 00:00:37.620 position:50% align:center
and created Amaterasu.

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:40.457 position:50% align:center
By the light of
Amaterasu's sacred flame,

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.542 position:50% align:center
the people began to rebuild.

00:00:42.625 --> 00:00:47.047 position:50% align:center
With its power, they established
a new state in the Far East.

00:01:07.192 --> 00:01:09.819 position:50% align:center
Looks like an old
subway station.

00:01:22.165 --> 00:01:23.750 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA]
That was powerful.

00:01:23.833 --> 00:01:26.294 position:50% align:center
It burned through
my coat instantly.

00:01:27.712 --> 00:01:29.673 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA]
Where's the shooter?

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:32.425 position:50% align:center
I haven't heard a sound.

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:34.678 position:50% align:center
But somewhere in the dark...

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:39.516 position:50% align:center
[ARROW] The young man
with the Adolla Burst:

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:42.727 position:50% align:center
The flame meant to
exterminate mankind.

00:01:42.811 --> 00:01:44.896 position:50% align:center
He doesn't belong with you.

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.565 position:50% align:center
I'd like to thank you
for bringing him to us.

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:49.859 position:50% align:center
You saved us some trouble.

00:01:51.027 --> 00:01:52.987 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA] What do you
intend to do with Shinra?

00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:55.240 position:50% align:center
Tell me your objective!

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:01.204 position:50% align:center
[ARROW]
Die.

00:02:32.736 --> 00:02:34.696 position:50% align:center
<i>take what you got and leave now</i>

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:36.865 position:50% align:center

00:02:36.948 --> 00:02:40.618 position:50% align:center

00:02:40.702 --> 00:02:42.662 position:50% align:center

<i>he wants you, don't you?</i>

00:02:48.585 --> 00:02:52.547 position:50% align:center
<i>you're crooked desire</i>
<i>left us in disarray</i>

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.509 position:50% align:center

00:03:19.282 --> 00:03:23.912 position:50% align:center

00:03:23.995 --> 00:03:27.957 position:50% align:center
<i>MAYDAY</i>

00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:31.961 position:50% align:center
<i>MAYDAY</i>

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:35.674 position:50% align:center
<i>MAYDAY</i>

00:03:38.093 --> 00:03:40.679 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Licht! Where are you?

00:03:40.762 --> 00:03:42.597 position:50% align:center
I'm completely cut off
from the others,

00:03:42.681 --> 00:03:45.934 position:50% align:center
and the enemy could
appear at any second.

00:03:46.017 --> 00:03:48.520 position:50% align:center
I'm Stays-On-His-Toes Man!

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:51.022 position:50% align:center
[WHITE-CLAD A]
Hold it.

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:53.525 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
You okay, Licht?

00:03:53.608 --> 00:03:55.068 position:50% align:center
[WHITE-CLAD A]
Don't move a muscle.

00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:58.488 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] To be honest,
Shinra, I-I've been better.

00:03:58.571 --> 00:04:01.366 position:50% align:center
[WHITE-CLAD A] You're the one
with the Adolla Burst, right?

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:04.619 position:50% align:center
If you value this man's life,
you'll do as I tell you.

00:04:04.703 --> 00:04:07.747 position:50% align:center
Hurry, Shinra! Use the Rapid!

00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:09.666 position:50% align:center
Ya know, the tiger hand sign!

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:11.084 position:50% align:center
[WHITE-CLAD A]
Be quiet.

00:04:12.961 --> 00:04:14.337 position:50% align:center
[WHITE-CLAD A yells]

00:04:18.883 --> 00:04:21.011 position:50% align:center
That's some pretty
impressive speed.

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:22.846 position:50% align:center
"The Rapid," you said.

00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:25.348 position:50% align:center
That's even cooler than
"Kicker-Man Kick."

00:04:25.432 --> 00:04:27.017 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.145 position:50% align:center
With my "Rapid-Man Kick,"
I can't be beat!

00:04:30.228 --> 00:04:31.646 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
I think Captain Shinmon's

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:32.897 position:50% align:center
gonna shoot that down, too.

00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:35.483 position:50% align:center
Why do you keep throwing
"man" into everything?

00:04:35.567 --> 00:04:38.361 position:50% align:center
One word. <i>Shinrabansho</i> .

00:04:38.445 --> 00:04:40.572 position:50% align:center
It means "all of nature."

00:04:40.655 --> 00:04:44.367 position:50% align:center
And well, since the "ban" can
also be pronounced as "man"...

00:04:44.451 --> 00:04:47.829 position:50% align:center
There's me. My little brother.

00:04:47.912 --> 00:04:51.124 position:50% align:center
And then, "man"!
Right smack between us.

00:04:51.207 --> 00:04:54.711 position:50% align:center
When we "ban" together,
we're Shinrabansho!

00:04:54.794 --> 00:04:56.796 position:50% align:center
That's why I'm
Says-Man-a-Lot Man.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.048 position:50% align:center
Makes perfect sense.

00:04:58.131 --> 00:05:00.091 position:50% align:center
You should explain it
to Shinmon like that.

00:05:00.175 --> 00:05:01.801 position:50% align:center
I'm sure it'll go great.

00:05:01.885 --> 00:05:04.804 position:50% align:center
[gunshots]

00:05:04.888 --> 00:05:05.889 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Huh?

00:05:05.972 --> 00:05:07.640 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Sounds like Lieutenant Hinawa.

00:05:07.724 --> 00:05:11.644 position:50% align:center
We should go. The others are
fighting the White-Clad, too.

00:05:11.728 --> 00:05:14.647 position:50% align:center
The more goons we beat,
the less they'll have to.

00:05:26.368 --> 00:05:29.204 position:50% align:center
Seems my position
has been compromised.

00:05:31.706 --> 00:05:32.999 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA]
Sniper's using the darkness

00:05:33.083 --> 00:05:34.751 position:50% align:center
as cover between attacks.

00:05:34.834 --> 00:05:38.963 position:50% align:center
And their fire's too bright
to trace back to them.

00:05:39.047 --> 00:05:41.383 position:50% align:center
I used Ricochet Control
to pepper a wide area,

00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:44.302 position:50% align:center
but there's no sign
I made contact.

00:05:44.386 --> 00:05:46.930 position:50% align:center
Can't get a clean shot with
all these obstructions.

00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:48.682 position:50% align:center
I should close in.

00:05:53.103 --> 00:05:55.772 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA] At any rate,
the enemy knows where I am.

00:05:55.855 --> 00:05:57.357 position:50% align:center
I need to move.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.151 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA]
No cover in here.

00:06:00.235 --> 00:06:02.862 position:50% align:center
I need to get through
as fast as I can.

00:06:04.572 --> 00:06:07.075 position:50% align:center
The moment he gives us
an opening, we'll attack.

00:06:07.158 --> 00:06:09.035 position:50% align:center
He's fighting Arrow, remember?

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:11.996 position:50% align:center
I doubt that we'll get the
chance to do anything.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.457 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA] We're both
using ranged weapons.

00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:16.209 position:50% align:center
But since I have my
Ricochet Control,

00:06:16.292 --> 00:06:18.795 position:50% align:center
I should have the
advantage up close.

00:06:19.796 --> 00:06:20.714 position:50% align:center
[ARROW]
Did you come in here

00:06:20.797 --> 00:06:23.383 position:50% align:center
to try and escape
from my arrows?

00:06:24.843 --> 00:06:28.471 position:50% align:center
[ARROW] How ironic. All you
did was trap yourself.

00:06:28.555 --> 00:06:30.348 position:50% align:center
Break.

00:06:30.432 --> 00:06:31.433 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:31.516 --> 00:06:32.684 position:50% align:center
Damn!

00:06:43.737 --> 00:06:46.823 position:50% align:center
[coughing]

00:06:46.906 --> 00:06:49.075 position:50% align:center
I've stumbled into
your hunting ground.

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:52.162 position:50% align:center
That's right, and I never
let my prey escape.

00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:54.998 position:50% align:center
I will be taking the
Adolla Burst as well.

00:06:58.251 --> 00:06:59.919 position:50% align:center
You're brainwashed zealots

00:07:00.003 --> 00:07:02.505 position:50% align:center
who can't see the
value of a human life.

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:04.758 position:50% align:center
Shinra would never help you.

00:07:04.841 --> 00:07:07.844 position:50% align:center
This scorched world is in
a constant state of flux.

00:07:07.927 --> 00:07:11.181 position:50% align:center
It's on the cusp of a great
upheaval as we speak.

00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:12.349 position:50% align:center
And in the wake of it,

00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:15.769 position:50% align:center
all our feelings will
amount to nothing.

00:07:15.852 --> 00:07:18.563 position:50% align:center
Those who insist that their
existence has meaning

00:07:18.646 --> 00:07:22.442 position:50% align:center
are fools who can't conform
themselves to this world.

00:07:22.525 --> 00:07:26.363 position:50% align:center
You say Shinra would never help
us, as if he has a choice,

00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:29.032 position:50% align:center
but his feelings don't matter.

00:07:29.115 --> 00:07:32.786 position:50% align:center
The Evangelist requires that
young man's Adolla Burst.

00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:35.163 position:50% align:center
So we will take it.

00:07:35.246 --> 00:07:37.791 position:50% align:center
When you look at yourself
as a member of a group,

00:07:37.874 --> 00:07:41.294 position:50% align:center
your feelings as an
individual lose importance.

00:07:41.378 --> 00:07:42.962 position:50% align:center
When that group's
the size of a country,

00:07:43.046 --> 00:07:46.341 position:50% align:center
or the world, that gets truer.

00:07:46.424 --> 00:07:49.302 position:50% align:center
At any second, those you care
for could burst into flames

00:07:49.386 --> 00:07:51.096 position:50% align:center
right in front of you.

00:07:51.179 --> 00:07:55.809 position:50% align:center
So it's probably for the best
if you forgo all attachments

00:07:55.892 --> 00:07:57.977 position:50% align:center
and fulfill your
dispassionate role,

00:07:58.061 --> 00:08:01.564 position:50% align:center
as an insignificant cog in
the machine of our society.

00:08:01.648 --> 00:08:03.483 position:50% align:center
One that feels nothing.

00:08:03.566 --> 00:08:07.696 position:50% align:center
There are many people, including
me, who think that way.

00:08:07.779 --> 00:08:09.948 position:50% align:center
It's certainly an
easier way to live.

00:08:10.031 --> 00:08:12.951 position:50% align:center
Emotions can be
downright exhausting.

00:08:13.993 --> 00:08:16.579 position:50% align:center
If that's how you see
things, why fight?

00:08:19.124 --> 00:08:22.794 position:50% align:center
First you tell me my soldier's
feelings don't matter,

00:08:22.877 --> 00:08:24.754 position:50% align:center
then you expect me
to hand him over?

00:08:24.838 --> 00:08:27.257 position:50% align:center
What do you take me for?

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:30.844 position:50% align:center
Philosophy aside,
you spit fuel in my face...

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:35.515 position:50% align:center
...you'd better expect
me to get fired up.

00:08:43.773 --> 00:08:46.234 position:50% align:center
Now that's a spectacle.

00:08:48.278 --> 00:08:50.613 position:50% align:center
It makes a devastating roar.

00:08:50.697 --> 00:08:53.199 position:50% align:center
And a devastating
shockwave, too.

00:08:53.283 --> 00:08:56.578 position:50% align:center
I don't get it. What
the hell is he firing?

00:09:02.584 --> 00:09:06.838 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA] These're just standard
7.62 by 51 millimeter bullets.

00:09:06.921 --> 00:09:09.716 position:50% align:center
But with all my
power behind them...

00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:12.385 position:50% align:center
...they move so fast that
I don't need to score a hit.

00:09:12.469 --> 00:09:15.513 position:50% align:center
The sonic boom will
do plenty of damage.

00:09:16.848 --> 00:09:18.266 position:50% align:center
[MIRAGE]
He destroys another gun barrel

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:20.602 position:50% align:center
every time he
pulls that trigger.

00:09:20.685 --> 00:09:22.896 position:50% align:center
[YONA] He makes that gun
shoot like a cannon.

00:09:22.979 --> 00:09:25.065 position:50% align:center
I wonder if Arrow's all right.

00:09:34.616 --> 00:09:37.660 position:50% align:center
I was looking for an
opportunity to finish him,

00:09:37.744 --> 00:09:39.579 position:50% align:center
but that would be like
stepping into a shootout

00:09:39.662 --> 00:09:41.790 position:50% align:center
between a pair of tanks!

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:50.715 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA]
My strength is spent.

00:09:50.799 --> 00:09:53.259 position:50% align:center
Vision's fading fast.

00:09:53.343 --> 00:09:57.013 position:50% align:center
It feels like my
eyelids are melting.

00:09:57.097 --> 00:10:01.393 position:50% align:center
I can feel my consciousness
drifting away.

00:10:01.476 --> 00:10:04.562 position:50% align:center
Through the dust and darkness
of this underground hell,

00:10:04.646 --> 00:10:07.857 position:50% align:center
all that I can make out
is the smell of gunpowder.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:15.323 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA] What's become
of... the other shooter?

00:10:19.285 --> 00:10:21.788 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA] When people can
burst into flames at random,

00:10:21.871 --> 00:10:25.542 position:50% align:center
and lose their lives
in an instant,

00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:28.545 position:50% align:center
becoming indifferent
about your own life

00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:31.673 position:50% align:center
is a way of devoting
yourself to the world.

00:10:33.216 --> 00:10:36.052 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA]
My death won't change a thing.

00:10:48.148 --> 00:10:50.191 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA]
Damn you, Obi.

00:10:50.275 --> 00:10:52.235 position:50% align:center
Making me a lieutenant
when the 8th

00:10:52.318 --> 00:10:55.280 position:50% align:center
is barely even big enough
to call a company.

00:10:55.363 --> 00:10:59.576 position:50% align:center
I'd feel guilty leaving you
to run things on your own.

00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:01.369 position:50% align:center
If I die down here,

00:11:01.453 --> 00:11:04.414 position:50% align:center
then who's gonna teach
our rookies discipline?

00:11:08.168 --> 00:11:10.420 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA] Know why you
couldn't finish me off?

00:11:10.503 --> 00:11:13.214 position:50% align:center
It's because your first shot
hit the wrong shoulder.

00:11:13.298 --> 00:11:17.052 position:50% align:center
I won't go down while I wear
the emblem of Company 8.

00:11:19.095 --> 00:11:24.726 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA] I'll use her flames...
to make it go even faster.

00:11:44.871 --> 00:11:47.248 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA]
That took a lot outta me.

00:11:47.332 --> 00:11:50.627 position:50% align:center
Doubt I'll be able
to move for a while.

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:52.671 position:50% align:center
It's funny.

00:11:52.754 --> 00:11:55.215 position:50% align:center
I thought that "push past
your limit" stuff

00:11:55.298 --> 00:11:58.176 position:50% align:center
was just a fantasy
for gullible kids.

00:12:04.182 --> 00:12:07.602 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA] You're the ones behind
the fog and the shimmers.

00:12:07.686 --> 00:12:11.272 position:50% align:center
Guess you finally think you
can take me. You cowards.

00:12:11.356 --> 00:12:13.525 position:50% align:center
[MIRAGE] Striking the enemy
when they're at their weakest

00:12:13.608 --> 00:12:15.402 position:50% align:center
is Tactics 101.

00:12:15.485 --> 00:12:18.697 position:50% align:center
Arrow was best-suited
to wear you down.

00:12:21.366 --> 00:12:22.617 position:50% align:center
So how does it feel to know

00:12:22.701 --> 00:12:25.328 position:50% align:center
that you'll soon die
at this coward's hand?

00:12:25.412 --> 00:12:28.623 position:50% align:center
I doubt you have the strength
to offer any resistance.

00:12:28.707 --> 00:12:31.126 position:50% align:center
Let me put you to rest.

00:12:39.592 --> 00:12:41.344 position:50% align:center
You would've done
me in with that.

00:12:41.428 --> 00:12:44.597 position:50% align:center
A shame it was only
a shimmer. Now die.

00:12:44.681 --> 00:12:47.684 position:50% align:center
That was surprisingly powerful
for a last-ditch effort.

00:12:47.767 --> 00:12:50.228 position:50% align:center
Not that it matters
when you miss.

00:12:53.857 --> 00:12:57.235 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA]
No. I hit my mark.

00:13:09.372 --> 00:13:10.582 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
Heh.

00:13:13.543 --> 00:13:15.754 position:50% align:center
Though I am descended
from the heavens,

00:13:15.837 --> 00:13:17.922 position:50% align:center
I was born from the earth below.

00:13:18.006 --> 00:13:20.550 position:50% align:center
I transverse the land and sky.

00:13:20.633 --> 00:13:21.760 position:50% align:center
Hm?

00:13:23.386 --> 00:13:25.055 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
I'm a knight.

00:13:28.308 --> 00:13:31.936 position:50% align:center
I saw Arthur watching us through
a tiny crack in the ceiling.

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:34.439 position:50% align:center
Signaled him to come on down.

00:13:36.274 --> 00:13:37.525 position:50% align:center
So you're the pure soul

00:13:37.609 --> 00:13:40.236 position:50% align:center
who summoned this heavenly
champion down to earth.

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:44.074 position:50% align:center
What do you need?
Have a quest for me?

00:13:46.534 --> 00:13:49.162 position:50% align:center
Do I really have to
explain the situation?

00:13:49.245 --> 00:13:50.121 position:50% align:center
You're good.

00:13:50.205 --> 00:13:51.831 position:50% align:center
His face was covered then,

00:13:51.915 --> 00:13:54.959 position:50% align:center
but I fought the shimmer
guy at Vulcan's.

00:13:55.043 --> 00:13:57.462 position:50% align:center
Why don't you handle
this, Mirage?

00:13:57.545 --> 00:13:58.880 position:50% align:center
[MIRAGE]
Not a problem.

00:13:58.963 --> 00:14:03.009 position:50% align:center
This one's more vulnerable
to my shimmers than most.

00:14:06.638 --> 00:14:08.973 position:50% align:center
Kind of a one-trick
pony, aren't you?

00:14:09.057 --> 00:14:13.311 position:50% align:center
[MIRAGE] This one trick has been
the end of every foe I've met.

00:14:13.395 --> 00:14:14.604 position:50% align:center
Die!

00:14:26.282 --> 00:14:27.826 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
That attack was fake.

00:14:27.909 --> 00:14:30.328 position:50% align:center
It didn't have the
breath of life in it.

00:14:30.412 --> 00:14:32.706 position:50% align:center
Let that stress heighten
your awareness.

00:14:32.789 --> 00:14:34.207 position:50% align:center
Feel life around you.

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:37.377 position:50% align:center
Not just your ally's,
but your enemy's, too.

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:39.129 position:50% align:center
Focus on the lives at stake

00:14:39.212 --> 00:14:41.506 position:50% align:center
and you can use the
stress of battle as a tool.

00:14:41.589 --> 00:14:44.926 position:50% align:center
Good. Don't let yourself fall
prey to diversions for feints!

00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:48.221 position:50% align:center
You have to discern the attack
that's coming to take your life!

00:14:49.431 --> 00:14:52.225 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR] Focus. Harness
the tension you're feeling.

00:14:52.308 --> 00:14:54.477 position:50% align:center
Sense the life around you.

00:14:56.646 --> 00:14:58.648 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR] Now that I've gained
the wisdom of the samurai,

00:14:58.732 --> 00:15:01.526 position:50% align:center
I'm multi-classing as...

00:15:01.609 --> 00:15:03.486 position:50% align:center
...a knight-samurai.

00:15:08.742 --> 00:15:12.454 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR] Hold up.
Lemme think this through.

00:15:12.537 --> 00:15:17.167 position:50% align:center
If I were a knight-samurai,
I'd be mostly a samurai, right?

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:18.960 position:50% align:center
That doesn't make sense.

00:15:21.379 --> 00:15:23.006 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
Oh, I had it backwards.

00:15:23.089 --> 00:15:26.551 position:50% align:center
I'm really... a samurai-knight.

00:15:30.805 --> 00:15:33.308 position:50% align:center
Your eyes are great at
tracking small movements.

00:15:33.391 --> 00:15:36.061 position:50% align:center
That can help you or
become a distraction.

00:15:36.144 --> 00:15:38.855 position:50% align:center
Be wary of deceptions
and feints.

00:15:42.484 --> 00:15:45.445 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR] There's more out there
than what the eye can see.

00:15:45.528 --> 00:15:46.738 position:50% align:center
[MIRAGE]
Maybe he's just pretending

00:15:46.821 --> 00:15:48.531 position:50% align:center
he can see through my illusions,

00:15:48.615 --> 00:15:51.993 position:50% align:center
trusting I'd probe with my
shimmers before attacking.

00:15:52.077 --> 00:15:56.039 position:50% align:center
In that case, with this large
a number attacking en masse,

00:15:56.122 --> 00:16:00.001 position:50% align:center
he'll have to assume
the real me is mixed in.

00:16:00.085 --> 00:16:03.213 position:50% align:center
But in truth,
all of them are fake!

00:16:04.172 --> 00:16:06.883 position:50% align:center
A real attack, the kind that's
intended to take your life,

00:16:06.966 --> 00:16:09.427 position:50% align:center
always comes with
a distinct breath.

00:16:09.511 --> 00:16:12.222 position:50% align:center
You need to listen for
that breath of life.

00:16:13.598 --> 00:16:15.725 position:50% align:center
Like the one I just took.

00:16:17.894 --> 00:16:19.562 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR] An attack with
the intent to kill

00:16:19.646 --> 00:16:21.356 position:50% align:center
will come with a breath.

00:16:21.439 --> 00:16:23.483 position:50% align:center
The breath of life.

00:16:23.566 --> 00:16:25.235 position:50% align:center
[MIRAGE] I refuse to
get anywhere near you

00:16:25.318 --> 00:16:28.029 position:50% align:center
until you let one of my
shimmers distract you

00:16:28.113 --> 00:16:30.073 position:50% align:center
and give me an opening.

00:16:30.156 --> 00:16:32.033 position:50% align:center
The instant I see that opening,

00:16:32.117 --> 00:16:35.829 position:50% align:center
my blade will leap from the
shadows and pierce your throat.

00:16:35.912 --> 00:16:37.997 position:50% align:center
But first...

00:16:38.081 --> 00:16:39.290 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA exhales]

00:16:39.374 --> 00:16:41.084 position:50% align:center
The breath of life!

00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:43.461 position:50% align:center
Iai-calibur attack!

00:16:54.806 --> 00:16:56.307 position:50% align:center
What was that for?

00:16:56.391 --> 00:16:59.144 position:50% align:center
Were you trying to kill me just
because you heard me breathing?

00:16:59.227 --> 00:17:00.729 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
Hm.

00:17:00.812 --> 00:17:04.733 position:50% align:center
I'm a samurai-knight.
My blade knows its enemies.

00:17:07.777 --> 00:17:10.530 position:50% align:center
[MIRAGE]
No. How did you--?

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:13.033 position:50% align:center
I heard his breath.

00:17:13.116 --> 00:17:14.701 position:50% align:center
While he thought
I was distracted,

00:17:14.784 --> 00:17:16.995 position:50% align:center
he tried to sneak
up and stab you.

00:17:17.078 --> 00:17:19.914 position:50% align:center
That villain is a
knave to his core.

00:17:19.998 --> 00:17:22.208 position:50% align:center
Can you stand?

00:17:22.292 --> 00:17:24.586 position:50% align:center
Impressive work, Arthur.

00:17:26.963 --> 00:17:28.340 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA]
Where'd the other one go?

00:17:28.423 --> 00:17:31.343 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR] Think he ditched
his pal and ran off.

00:17:31.426 --> 00:17:33.762 position:50% align:center
What was up with
that one's face?

00:17:33.845 --> 00:17:36.556 position:50% align:center
Think he's human?

00:17:36.639 --> 00:17:38.641 position:50% align:center
The man's face was
somewhat mask-like.

00:17:38.725 --> 00:17:41.144 position:50% align:center
But what would he be
if not a human?

00:17:49.402 --> 00:17:51.237 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA]
We need to rejoin the others.

00:17:51.321 --> 00:17:53.114 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
Great. Lead the way.

00:17:56.785 --> 00:17:58.828 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA]
So it goes.

00:18:02.123 --> 00:18:05.210 position:50% align:center
Looks like the tunnel forks
off again. This sucks.

00:18:05.293 --> 00:18:07.879 position:50% align:center
Why is the Nether
confusing and scary?

00:18:07.962 --> 00:18:11.257 position:50% align:center
Have any ideas about
which way we should try?

00:18:14.094 --> 00:18:15.929 position:50% align:center
Do you see what I see?

00:18:16.012 --> 00:18:18.807 position:50% align:center
There's something glowing
on the left side.

00:18:21.267 --> 00:18:23.603 position:50% align:center
Two things! And they're
coming toward us!

00:18:23.687 --> 00:18:25.355 position:50% align:center
They're glowing eyes.

00:18:25.438 --> 00:18:28.149 position:50% align:center
--[SPUTTER] Sputter!
--[FLARE] Flare!

00:18:28.233 --> 00:18:30.235 position:50% align:center
Demon!

00:18:30.318 --> 00:18:32.570 position:50% align:center
Who are you calling an
oversized tunnel troll?!

00:18:32.654 --> 00:18:35.573 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI, IRIS]
We never said that, we swear!

00:18:35.657 --> 00:18:38.493 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey. It's you, Maki.

00:18:38.576 --> 00:18:41.955 position:50% align:center
So those demonic
eyes were just...

00:18:42.038 --> 00:18:44.416 position:50% align:center
...Sputter and Flare.

00:18:44.499 --> 00:18:47.085 position:50% align:center
[IRIS, TAMAKI] Maki!
It's super scary down here!

00:18:47.168 --> 00:18:49.504 position:50% align:center
There, there. You'll
be safe with me.

00:18:52.382 --> 00:18:53.508 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN gasps]

00:18:54.551 --> 00:18:57.137 position:50% align:center
Two life signs just
showed up outta nowhere.

00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:00.515 position:50% align:center
They're 15 meters away.
We should be able to see them.

00:19:00.598 --> 00:19:02.058 position:50% align:center
Are they on our side?

00:19:02.142 --> 00:19:03.810 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
You will never see a person

00:19:03.893 --> 00:19:07.022 position:50% align:center
who is on your side again.

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:15.780 position:50% align:center
Hey, Lisa.

00:19:15.864 --> 00:19:16.990 position:50% align:center
[LISA]
So you finally gave up

00:19:17.073 --> 00:19:19.826 position:50% align:center
and put on the uniform
you despised.

00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:21.828 position:50% align:center
You look like a
fool in it, Vulcan.

00:19:21.911 --> 00:19:23.830 position:50% align:center
You know that, right?

00:19:25.874 --> 00:19:28.501 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN] And you look great
in whatever you wear.

00:19:29.961 --> 00:19:32.630 position:50% align:center
You've always hated the Fire
Force more than anything.

00:19:32.714 --> 00:19:34.799 position:50% align:center
So what would make you
follow them underground?

00:19:34.883 --> 00:19:36.259 position:50% align:center
How is that a question?

00:19:36.343 --> 00:19:39.554 position:50% align:center
I obviously came down
here to see you, Lisa.

00:19:44.267 --> 00:19:46.394 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
What's the matter, Feeler?

00:19:46.478 --> 00:19:47.896 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:47.979 --> 00:19:49.439 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
Are you forgetting who it was

00:19:49.522 --> 00:19:51.316 position:50% align:center
that gave you a home?

00:19:51.399 --> 00:19:54.944 position:50% align:center
Who accepted a filthy,
ignorant cat like you

00:19:55.028 --> 00:19:57.489 position:50% align:center
and taught you
everything you know.

00:19:57.572 --> 00:20:00.283 position:50% align:center
Who showed you how
to manipulate fire.

00:20:00.367 --> 00:20:02.952 position:50% align:center
How to manipulate men.

00:20:03.036 --> 00:20:04.704 position:50% align:center
You only gained
Vulcan's affection

00:20:04.788 --> 00:20:06.956 position:50% align:center
by using the techniques
I taught you.

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:10.418 position:50% align:center
He only took you in because
you followed my teachings.

00:20:10.502 --> 00:20:12.545 position:50% align:center
Without me, you are nothing.

00:20:12.629 --> 00:20:16.007 position:50% align:center
Nothing but a stupid, dirty cat.

00:20:16.091 --> 00:20:19.386 position:50% align:center
Understand? Or do you
need another lesson?

00:20:19.469 --> 00:20:21.721 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
Get the hell away from her!

00:20:33.608 --> 00:20:36.319 position:50% align:center
You should know my
true name is Feeler.

00:20:36.403 --> 00:20:39.531 position:50% align:center
And that I am a knight
of the Ashen Flame.

00:20:42.742 --> 00:20:45.745 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] That's right.
Protect me with your life.

00:20:45.829 --> 00:20:46.621 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir.

00:20:46.705 --> 00:20:48.623 position:50% align:center
He's lying to you, damn it!

00:20:48.707 --> 00:20:49.916 position:50% align:center
[LISA]
Shut up!

00:20:51.501 --> 00:20:53.294 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
The Iron-madillo?

00:20:53.378 --> 00:20:55.046 position:50% align:center
[OBI] Something tells
me that your lessons

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:58.008 position:50% align:center
did Lisa more harm than good.

00:20:58.091 --> 00:21:01.636 position:50% align:center
But regardless, teaching the
youth is just what grown-ups do!

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:04.556 position:50% align:center
So stop pretending she
owes you, you geezer!

00:21:04.639 --> 00:21:06.307 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI chuckles]

00:21:06.391 --> 00:21:08.977 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] Come to think of it,
you're quite ignorant, too.

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:11.187 position:50% align:center
Feckless captain of the 8th.

00:21:11.271 --> 00:21:13.064 position:50% align:center
You can call me what you want.

00:21:13.148 --> 00:21:14.315 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
You don't even know

00:21:14.399 --> 00:21:18.695 position:50% align:center
what the flames of
human combustion are.

00:21:18.778 --> 00:21:21.990 position:50% align:center
But our Evangelist
knows everything.

00:21:22.073 --> 00:21:24.200 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:21:24.284 --> 00:21:27.037 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] Why the spontaneous
human combustion phenomenon

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:29.497 position:50% align:center
is assaulting our world.

00:21:29.581 --> 00:21:31.207 position:50% align:center
The true nature of the bugs

00:21:31.291 --> 00:21:34.127 position:50% align:center
that have created
artificial Infernals.

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:38.715 position:50% align:center
The secret behind Shinra
Kusakabe's Adolla Burst.

00:21:38.798 --> 00:21:43.178 position:50% align:center
Why his fire is known to us
as the "Flame of Perdition."

00:21:43.261 --> 00:21:47.140 position:50% align:center
What happened to this
world in the past.

00:21:47.223 --> 00:21:51.144 position:50% align:center
And what is happening
to it as we speak.

00:21:51.227 --> 00:21:55.690 position:50% align:center
The Evangelist knows
all this and more.

00:21:55.774 --> 00:21:58.526 position:50% align:center
But I will not share
that knowledge.

00:22:00.779 --> 00:22:04.240 position:50% align:center
[OBI] It sounds like you
really are a lousy teacher.

00:22:04.324 --> 00:22:05.950 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI chuckles]

00:22:06.034 --> 00:22:08.870 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
You're an intriguing man.
