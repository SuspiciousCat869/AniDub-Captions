They examined its components.
The main one is Infernal ashes.

00:04:47.078 --> 00:04:50.623 position:50% align:center
Those ashes...
belonged to an Infernal?

Turning the remains of the
dead into an explosive?

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.920 position:50% align:center

Wake up!

Quit looking like you're
about to die of boredom.

Hey.

00:06:14.833 --> 00:06:16.042 position:50% align:center
Yeah, what?

Why did you decide to
become a Fire Soldier?

00:06:18.294 --> 00:06:20.088 position:50% align:center
Easy, 'cause I'm a knight.

Think you brave soldiers
can help get him down?

Go and rescue a dog?

That kinda sounds like a job
for regular firefighters.

00:06:34.144 --> 00:06:35.895 position:50% align:center
[MAKI] We get calls
mistaking Fire Soldiers

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:37.689 position:50% align:center

Yeah, so... that's
not exactly a dog.

What were you doing up a tree?

00:07:20.607 --> 00:07:23.151 position:50% align:center
[MAMORU-KUN] I was in the
shopping district for an event,

00:07:23.234 --> 00:07:24.736 position:50% align:center
passing out balloons,

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:27.739 position:50% align:center

[STUDENTS]
Hooray.

00:07:30.033 --> 00:07:32.702 position:50% align:center
Why would they do
something like that?

[MAMORU-KUN]
Do you remember the killings

00:07:36.998 --> 00:07:39.209 position:50% align:center
carried out by that firefighter?

00:07:39.292 --> 00:07:40.460 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Huh?

00:07:40.543 --> 00:07:43.213 position:50% align:center
[MAMORU-KUN]
The man's name was Miyamoto.

00:07:43.296 --> 00:07:46.549 position:50% align:center
He killed four people
for the fun of it.

00:07:46.633 --> 00:07:48.885 position:50% align:center
Folks have resented the
Fire Defense Agency

00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:51.930 position:50% align:center
and firefighters themselves
since the murders.

00:07:52.013 --> 00:07:55.809 position:50% align:center
Sometimes, they take their
aggression out on us like this.

00:07:55.892 --> 00:07:59.771 position:50% align:center
So what ended up happening
to that firefighter?

00:07:59.854 --> 00:08:02.982 position:50% align:center
[MAMORU-KUN] His verdict is
scheduled to be announced today.

00:08:03.066 --> 00:08:04.359 position:50% align:center
According to the scuttlebutt,

00:08:04.442 --> 00:08:08.571 position:50% align:center
he'll be found not guilty
for psychiatric reasons.

00:08:09.989 --> 00:08:14.160 position:50% align:center

hereby finds you not guilty.

Pretty easily, too.

00:08:23.545 --> 00:08:24.587 position:50% align:center
Makes sense.

00:08:24.671 --> 00:08:25.839 position:50% align:center
This country'd be up a creek

00:08:25.922 --> 00:08:29.009 position:50% align:center

Do as you're told
and lick my shoe.

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:53.967 position:50% align:center
I'm trying to talk
to you seriously!

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:55.677 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:19:01.224 --> 00:19:02.934 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA]
Hold him down!

00:19:04.227 --> 00:19:05.895 position:50% align:center
[ANGELS]
The 5th Angels Three are here.

00:19:05.979 --> 00:19:07.731 position:50% align:center
Ready for action.

00:19:11.234 --> 00:19:13.695 position:50% align:center
[KISHIRI]
Out of the way! Move it!

00:19:19.159 --> 00:19:20.368 position:50% align:center
Hey, you!

00:19:20.452 --> 00:19:23.413 position:50% align:center
Fire Soldiers are supposed
to keep people safe.

00:19:23.496 --> 00:19:26.166 position:50% align:center
Have you dirtbags at
the 5th forgotten that?

00:19:26.249 --> 00:19:29.252 position:50% align:center
C'mon, it's not like we
used the brat for kindling.

00:19:29.336 --> 00:19:31.755 position:50% align:center
We'd have to dry him out first.

00:19:37.385 --> 00:19:40.388 position:50% align:center
Don't even crack jokes
about burning children.

00:19:40.472 --> 00:19:41.973 position:50% align:center
Not ever.

00:19:42.057 --> 00:19:43.516 position:50% align:center
Oh?

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:46.853 position:50% align:center
I'm about to show you what
a Fire Soldier should be.

00:19:46.936 --> 00:19:49.189 position:50% align:center
Come at me, Company 5!

00:19:49.272 --> 00:19:50.857 position:50% align:center
You're up against
Shinra Kusakabe,

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:53.693 position:50% align:center
Second-Class Fire
Soldier from the 8th!

00:19:54.861 --> 00:19:56.821 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA]
This should be fun.

00:20:02.035 --> 00:20:03.370 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
What happened?

00:20:09.459 --> 00:20:11.127 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA]
It's unusual for an Infernal

00:20:11.211 --> 00:20:13.254 position:50% align:center
to be as lucid as this one.

00:20:13.338 --> 00:20:16.383 position:50% align:center
Simply killing him
would be a waste.

00:20:16.466 --> 00:20:19.094 position:50% align:center
Our research team
will make use of him.

00:20:19.177 --> 00:20:21.471 position:50% align:center
You must know you're in
the 8th's jurisdiction.

00:20:21.554 --> 00:20:24.182 position:50% align:center
Yet it feels like you're
trying to call the shots.

00:20:24.265 --> 00:20:26.059 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA] Legally,
this man has been deceased

00:20:26.142 --> 00:20:27.977 position:50% align:center
since the moment he transformed.

00:20:28.061 --> 00:20:30.689 position:50% align:center
You could extinguish him
and return him to ash,

00:20:30.772 --> 00:20:33.441 position:50% align:center
but you'll agree that this
corpse would be easier

00:20:33.525 --> 00:20:35.568 position:50% align:center
to study in its current state.

00:20:35.652 --> 00:20:37.946 position:50% align:center
And the 8th is a newer company.

00:20:38.029 --> 00:20:40.824 position:50% align:center
I'm told that you've yet
to recruit a science team.

00:20:40.907 --> 00:20:43.284 position:50% align:center
This is quite the rare specimen.

00:20:43.368 --> 00:20:46.913 position:50% align:center
If solving the mystery of human
combustion is a goal we share,

00:20:46.996 --> 00:20:48.289 position:50% align:center
then you should
want this Infernal

00:20:48.373 --> 00:20:51.084 position:50% align:center
to be researched by the 5th.

00:20:51.167 --> 00:20:53.586 position:50% align:center
Can I take that as a promise
that you'll share the results

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:55.630 position:50% align:center
of your research with us?

00:20:55.714 --> 00:20:57.841 position:50% align:center
Oh, absolutely!

00:21:02.137 --> 00:21:03.471 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Very well.

00:21:03.555 --> 00:21:06.266 position:50% align:center
I'll leave the Infernal
in your custody.

00:21:07.934 --> 00:21:09.644 position:50% align:center
[KISHIRI]
Someone's scared.

00:21:09.728 --> 00:21:10.979 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:14.232 --> 00:21:17.110 position:50% align:center
I hear you're a powerless
nobody, Captain.

00:21:17.193 --> 00:21:19.529 position:50% align:center
So it's no wonder
you backed down.

00:21:19.612 --> 00:21:22.198 position:50% align:center
The mayor of Loserville.

00:21:22.282 --> 00:21:23.908 position:50% align:center
You better watch your
mouth, or else.

00:21:23.992 --> 00:21:25.076 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
You wanna fight, punk?

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:26.578 position:50% align:center
Oh, dear me, I've pissed off

00:21:26.661 --> 00:21:29.247 position:50% align:center
Captain Nobody's
Second-Class lackies.

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:32.250 position:50% align:center
Shinra! Arthur! Break it up!

00:21:32.334 --> 00:21:33.543 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA, ARTHUR,
KISHIRI shouting]

00:21:33.626 --> 00:21:34.711 position:50% align:center
[KISHIRI grunts]

00:21:37.589 --> 00:21:39.049 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Uhh.

00:21:39.132 --> 00:21:41.259 position:50% align:center
[humming]

00:21:41.343 --> 00:21:42.385 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:21:49.726 --> 00:21:51.061 position:50% align:center
A quick warning.

00:21:51.144 --> 00:21:53.521 position:50% align:center
If a brave little firefighter
should stick his nose

00:21:53.605 --> 00:21:55.190 position:50% align:center
where it doesn't belong,

00:21:55.273 --> 00:21:59.569 position:50% align:center
he'll run the risk of being
extinguished himself.

00:21:59.652 --> 00:22:01.112 position:50% align:center
Well, thanks for the tip.

00:22:01.196 --> 00:22:04.824 position:50% align:center
It sounds like I've been blowin'
smoke in somebody's face.

00:22:04.908 --> 00:22:07.827 position:50% align:center
Thing is, my flame
is Company 8th's,

00:22:07.911 --> 00:22:10.789 position:50% align:center
and it won't go out easy.

00:22:10.872 --> 00:22:12.499 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:22:22.676 --> 00:22:26.388 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA] Special Fire Force
Company 5, we're leaving.
