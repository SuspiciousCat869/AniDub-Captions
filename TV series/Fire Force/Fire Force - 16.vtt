00:00:25.567 --> 00:00:28.528 position:50% align:center
[IRIS] As the world man had
built was buried in ash,

00:00:28.611 --> 00:00:30.572 position:50% align:center
a leader appeared.

00:00:30.655 --> 00:00:34.993 position:50% align:center
A man who would later be
known as Raffles the 1st.

00:00:35.076 --> 00:00:37.495 position:50% align:center
Raffles and his disciples
embarked on a quest

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.540 position:50% align:center
to find new light, and they did.

00:00:40.623 --> 00:00:43.877 position:50% align:center
What Raffles found was
an unsullied flame,

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.796 position:50% align:center
the spark that would
kindle an empire.

00:00:58.516 --> 00:00:59.642 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
Here.

00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:02.479 position:50% align:center
Granddad, Pop, I brought
your favorite sodas.

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:03.813 position:50% align:center
They're open, too,

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:06.983 position:50% align:center
so you don't have to worry
about gettin' sprayed.

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:08.151 position:50% align:center
With the two of you gone,

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:10.362 position:50% align:center
I've got three times
as much work to do.

00:01:10.445 --> 00:01:12.447 position:50% align:center
Luckily, you didn't
raise a slacker,

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.366 position:50% align:center
so I'm makin' it work.

00:01:15.825 --> 00:01:20.205 position:50% align:center
Once I set my mind,
there's not much I can't do.

00:01:20.288 --> 00:01:23.458 position:50% align:center
Also, I've got some good
people helping me.

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:28.129 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
They're my new family.

00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:32.300 position:50% align:center
[drumming]

00:01:39.015 --> 00:01:39.891 position:50% align:center
Whew.

00:01:39.974 --> 00:01:41.226 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Hey, Vulcan.

00:01:41.309 --> 00:01:44.062 position:50% align:center
You mind taking a look
at my prototype?

00:01:45.146 --> 00:01:48.483 position:50% align:center
Whoa. Nice. Ya put this
together pretty well.

00:01:48.566 --> 00:01:49.859 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Thanks for saying so.

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:51.069 position:50% align:center
Now let's test it.

00:01:51.152 --> 00:01:53.405 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Like how?

00:01:53.488 --> 00:01:56.700 position:50% align:center
No! Why?

00:01:56.783 --> 00:01:59.244 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN] Sorry, kid.
It was just too fragile.

00:01:59.327 --> 00:02:02.205 position:50% align:center
[YU] What? Everything's fragile
if you smash it that hard!

00:02:02.288 --> 00:02:03.456 position:50% align:center
No. Not true.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.791 position:50% align:center
There are certain
things in this world

00:02:04.874 --> 00:02:06.084 position:50% align:center
that should never break.

00:02:06.167 --> 00:02:08.294 position:50% align:center
Things that people depend on.

00:02:08.378 --> 00:02:09.671 position:50% align:center
Yeah, like what?

00:02:09.754 --> 00:02:11.381 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
Like boats or bridges.

00:02:11.464 --> 00:02:14.342 position:50% align:center
If they broke at random,
people would die.

00:02:14.426 --> 00:02:17.387 position:50% align:center
Then there's Amaterasu.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.097 position:50% align:center
An everlasting power source--

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.349 position:50% align:center
it never stops and
it never breaks down.

00:02:21.433 --> 00:02:22.600 position:50% align:center
Because if it ever did,

00:02:22.684 --> 00:02:25.311 position:50% align:center
that would be an
Empire-wide disaster.

00:02:27.272 --> 00:02:30.316 position:50% align:center
Hey, Yu, and, Vulc!
Food's ready.

00:02:32.527 --> 00:02:36.031 position:50% align:center
Wow, Lisa. Yeah, speakin' of
things too precious to break.

00:02:36.114 --> 00:02:38.533 position:50% align:center
[LISA] They're just rice
omelettes. Tear into 'em.

00:02:38.616 --> 00:02:39.951 position:50% align:center
Thanks for the food.

00:02:40.035 --> 00:02:41.828 position:50% align:center
All things must pass.

00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:45.373 position:50% align:center
They say that anything with
form'll fall apart someday.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.920 position:50% align:center
That idea kinda
makes me wonder.

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:54.090 position:50% align:center
Do human bonds have form?

00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:58.762 position:50% align:center
Given enough time,
do families break?

00:02:58.845 --> 00:03:03.058 position:50% align:center
Did my family fall apart
when Pop and Granddad died?

00:03:03.141 --> 00:03:06.853 position:50% align:center
No. We were still a family.
Death couldn't change that fact.

00:03:06.936 --> 00:03:09.230 position:50% align:center
Some bonds never break.

00:03:10.482 --> 00:03:12.192 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:03:12.275 --> 00:03:14.277 position:50% align:center
And that's what I wanna build.

00:03:14.361 --> 00:03:17.238 position:50% align:center
Machines and bonds
that can't be broken.

00:03:47.686 --> 00:03:49.646 position:50% align:center
<i>take what you got and leave now</i>

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:51.815 position:50% align:center

00:03:51.898 --> 00:03:55.568 position:50% align:center

00:03:55.652 --> 00:03:57.612 position:50% align:center

<i>MAYDAY</i>

00:04:54.252 --> 00:04:57.464 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR] You think Company 3's
captain is out to kill Vulcan?

00:04:57.547 --> 00:05:01.092 position:50% align:center
It's basically just a hunch.
I feel sure though.

00:05:01.176 --> 00:05:03.053 position:50% align:center
But he was trying
to recruit Vulcan.

00:05:03.136 --> 00:05:04.471 position:50% align:center
If he wants him in his company,

00:05:04.554 --> 00:05:06.514 position:50% align:center
then why would he
try to murder him?

00:05:06.598 --> 00:05:08.975 position:50% align:center
It just doesn't
make sense to me.

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:12.270 position:50% align:center
It might be because of his
family's history with Haijima.

00:05:12.354 --> 00:05:14.647 position:50% align:center
Are you planning to
tell Vulcan about this?

00:05:14.731 --> 00:05:16.691 position:50% align:center
I doubt he'll believe you.

00:05:16.775 --> 00:05:18.651 position:50% align:center
After all, I don't
even believe you.

00:05:18.735 --> 00:05:21.988 position:50% align:center
I might be wrong, but I've
got a hunch of my own.

00:05:22.072 --> 00:05:25.450 position:50% align:center
Could this have to do with
that Adolla Burst of yours?

00:05:25.533 --> 00:05:27.660 position:50% align:center
I think it probably does.

00:05:27.744 --> 00:05:29.829 position:50% align:center
Not sure how yet.

00:05:29.913 --> 00:05:32.499 position:50% align:center
This happened at Asakusa, too.

00:05:32.582 --> 00:05:35.001 position:50% align:center
What I felt was
more than intuition.

00:05:35.085 --> 00:05:38.004 position:50% align:center
It was like I could hear
Konro asking for help.

00:05:38.088 --> 00:05:41.675 position:50% align:center
And, well, it turned out he had.

00:05:41.758 --> 00:05:45.053 position:50% align:center
All I know is that I'd be
a fool to ignore this.

00:05:46.805 --> 00:05:49.224 position:50% align:center
The two of you should go
back to the workshop.

00:05:49.307 --> 00:05:51.434 position:50% align:center
Let Vulcan know
that he's in danger.

00:05:51.518 --> 00:05:52.686 position:50% align:center
[IRIS]
Right.

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:54.396 position:50% align:center
What're you planning to do?

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:56.940 position:50% align:center
Need to find out if
this is just Giovanni

00:05:57.023 --> 00:05:59.234 position:50% align:center
or the whole of Company 3.

00:05:59.317 --> 00:06:01.403 position:50% align:center
Luckily, he doesn't
know we're here yet.

00:06:01.486 --> 00:06:03.947 position:50% align:center
I'll try to scout him out
from a high vantage point.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:07.075 position:50% align:center
We can base our next move
off of what I find.

00:06:10.245 --> 00:06:12.205 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] We're the only ones
who can fight, Arthur.

00:06:12.288 --> 00:06:13.623 position:50% align:center
I'm counting on you!

00:06:13.707 --> 00:06:16.376 position:50% align:center
Hold on! What was the plan?

00:06:19.087 --> 00:06:21.840 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] Causes of death
are many and varied.

00:06:21.923 --> 00:06:26.136 position:50% align:center
Kill Vulcan and his friends,
a murder-suicide.

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:28.555 position:50% align:center
Or an Infernal-caused fire.

00:06:28.638 --> 00:06:30.181 position:50% align:center
[FLAIL, MIRAGE]
Yes, sir.

00:06:30.265 --> 00:06:34.561 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] Before you go,
cast off your false raiments.

00:06:34.644 --> 00:06:36.146 position:50% align:center
[FLAIL, MIRAGE]
Sir.

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.858 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Faithfulness to the Evangelist.

00:06:41.943 --> 00:06:45.488 position:50% align:center
Why would you think that Doctor
Giovanni's planning to kill me?

00:06:45.572 --> 00:06:48.783 position:50% align:center
If one of us was about to jump
to murder, it would be me.

00:06:48.867 --> 00:06:51.244 position:50% align:center
I'm the one who's got
a grudge against him.

00:06:51.327 --> 00:06:52.704 position:50% align:center
Yeah, well...

00:06:52.787 --> 00:06:56.332 position:50% align:center
Shinra kinda had a vision.
Except it was with his ears.

00:06:57.959 --> 00:06:59.753 position:50% align:center
I hoped that you guys
might be different

00:06:59.836 --> 00:07:01.796 position:50% align:center
from the other Fire Soldiers.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.132 position:50% align:center
But makin' crap up just to
scare me into joining you

00:07:04.215 --> 00:07:06.009 position:50% align:center
is pretty damn typical.

00:07:06.092 --> 00:07:08.470 position:50% align:center
You really can't imagine
a motive for him?

00:07:08.553 --> 00:07:10.513 position:50% align:center
You've got history
with Haijima, right?

00:07:10.597 --> 00:07:13.475 position:50% align:center
True, but I'm the one
who has beef with them!

00:07:13.558 --> 00:07:15.018 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Uh! Vulcan!

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:16.311 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:27.614 position:50% align:center
Think there's close
to a hundred of them.

00:07:27.697 --> 00:07:29.657 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
All this just to get me?

00:07:29.741 --> 00:07:31.201 position:50% align:center
That's insane.

00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:33.453 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR] How did Shinra let
that big a force get past him?

00:07:33.536 --> 00:07:35.830 position:50% align:center
What the hell's he
doing out there?

00:07:37.499 --> 00:07:39.459 position:50% align:center
Why's it so quiet?

00:07:47.676 --> 00:07:51.179 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] I thought something
seemed unusual at the workshop.

00:07:51.262 --> 00:07:54.557 position:50% align:center
Company 8 is on
the scene, is it?

00:07:54.641 --> 00:07:57.185 position:50% align:center
I hate surprises.

00:08:00.814 --> 00:08:03.400 position:50% align:center
[coughing]

00:08:03.483 --> 00:08:05.985 position:50% align:center
Damn it. Where are you?

00:08:06.069 --> 00:08:07.028 position:50% align:center
Come face me!

00:08:07.112 --> 00:08:08.947 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
Shinra Kusakabe.

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:12.325 position:50% align:center
The rookie who possesses
an Adolla Burst.

00:08:12.409 --> 00:08:15.495 position:50% align:center
I'll capture him and take
him to the Evangelist.

00:08:17.455 --> 00:08:18.707 position:50% align:center
What the--?

00:08:22.127 --> 00:08:23.211 position:50% align:center
They're flying that thing

00:08:23.294 --> 00:08:25.338 position:50% align:center
by controlling the
booster in its wrist.

00:08:25.422 --> 00:08:27.716 position:50% align:center
Must be a second generation.

00:08:29.926 --> 00:08:31.886 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Just follow the wire.

00:08:36.641 --> 00:08:38.101 position:50% align:center
They're gone.

00:08:39.978 --> 00:08:41.980 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:08:42.063 --> 00:08:43.398 position:50% align:center
Damn you.

00:08:43.481 --> 00:08:45.567 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
What kind of monster is he?

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:48.361 position:50% align:center
That's two million
volts of current.

00:08:48.445 --> 00:08:49.446 position:50% align:center
Well then...

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:52.741 position:50% align:center
[screaming]

00:08:52.824 --> 00:08:54.200 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
Your friends at the workshop

00:08:54.284 --> 00:08:57.620 position:50% align:center
are currently meeting
the same fate as you.

00:09:08.506 --> 00:09:10.842 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
Is the enemy behind that tree?

00:09:10.925 --> 00:09:13.970 position:50% align:center
What if he's not?
What if he has allies?

00:09:14.054 --> 00:09:18.016 position:50% align:center
Should I create a diversion
and wait to see how he reacts?

00:09:18.099 --> 00:09:20.226 position:50% align:center
Had you considered
every possibility,

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.145 position:50% align:center
you'd still be standing.

00:09:22.228 --> 00:09:24.064 position:50% align:center
Because you would've fled,

00:09:24.147 --> 00:09:27.776 position:50% align:center
recognizing that you
cannot defeat me.

00:09:27.859 --> 00:09:30.487 position:50% align:center
One should knock on a bridge
to test its strength

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:32.864 position:50% align:center
before stepping forward.

00:09:34.449 --> 00:09:36.618 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
This is Doctor Giovanni.

00:09:36.701 --> 00:09:38.703 position:50% align:center
I've made a serendipitous catch.

00:09:38.787 --> 00:09:41.164 position:50% align:center
Requesting retrieval.

00:09:41.247 --> 00:09:45.502 position:50% align:center
Yes, that's right. The young
man with the Adolla Burst.

00:09:46.878 --> 00:09:49.297 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] Now that you've
fallen into my hands,

00:09:49.381 --> 00:09:51.591 position:50% align:center
we're one step
closer to realizing

00:09:51.675 --> 00:09:53.677 position:50% align:center
the Evangelist's dream.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:59.849 position:50% align:center
All that's left for us to do
is take that key from Vulcan.

00:09:59.933 --> 00:10:01.810 position:50% align:center
You two are Fire
Soldiers, right?

00:10:01.893 --> 00:10:03.687 position:50% align:center
Can you fight these guys?

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:06.439 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR] I could, but I didn't
bring my sword with me.

00:10:06.523 --> 00:10:10.276 position:50% align:center
And to be honest, I don't feel
very knightly at the moment.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:13.738 position:50% align:center
When I don't feel like a knight,
my flames get really weak.

00:10:13.822 --> 00:10:16.574 position:50% align:center
Huh...?

00:10:16.658 --> 00:10:19.911 position:50% align:center
Like, I need a weapon
that feels more swordly.

00:10:19.994 --> 00:10:21.413 position:50% align:center
Gimme something with
more swordliness

00:10:21.496 --> 00:10:23.289 position:50% align:center
and I'll get way stronger.

00:10:25.667 --> 00:10:28.294 position:50% align:center
If you seek Arthur
Boyle's protection,

00:10:28.378 --> 00:10:30.588 position:50% align:center
then you should know,
the more I look like a knight,

00:10:30.672 --> 00:10:32.549 position:50% align:center
the greater my power grows.

00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:34.926 position:50% align:center
That's why they call
me the Knight King.

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:39.139 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I could tell at a glance.
You're as dumb as I thought.

00:10:41.141 --> 00:10:43.059 position:50% align:center
So if I help you to
dress up like a knight,

00:10:43.143 --> 00:10:45.895 position:50% align:center
then you'll get stronger,
is that right?

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:51.735 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
Knightly...

00:10:51.818 --> 00:10:54.029 position:50% align:center
Knightly.

00:10:54.112 --> 00:10:56.698 position:50% align:center
Yeah. A brave steed.

00:10:58.992 --> 00:11:03.538 position:50% align:center
Mirage, wait back here
and maintain our perimeter.

00:11:03.621 --> 00:11:05.165 position:50% align:center
[MIRAGE]
As you say.

00:11:05.248 --> 00:11:08.710 position:50% align:center
I will bust in there
and clear the place out.

00:11:10.378 --> 00:11:11.463 position:50% align:center
[FLAIL]
Hm?

00:11:18.803 --> 00:11:22.015 position:50% align:center
Vulcan, you just tied
a tarp to his shoulders.

00:11:22.098 --> 00:11:24.017 position:50% align:center
Is that really gonna help him?

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.560 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
That's not all I did.

00:11:25.643 --> 00:11:27.729 position:50% align:center
It's based on how
he feels, right?

00:11:27.812 --> 00:11:30.482 position:50% align:center
Well, he seemed happy enough
when he went out there.

00:11:33.193 --> 00:11:35.695 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
High-ho, Silver!

00:11:35.779 --> 00:11:38.490 position:50% align:center
[DONKEY]
Hee-haw!

00:11:38.573 --> 00:11:41.826 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but, c'mon, he doesn't
look like a knight at all.

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:44.913 position:50% align:center
I mean, there's a donkey head
strapped to his crotch.

00:11:44.996 --> 00:11:46.581 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN groans]

00:11:46.664 --> 00:11:50.293 position:50% align:center
[HORSE whinnies]

00:11:50.377 --> 00:11:54.172 position:50% align:center
My king commanded me to defend
the princess and her courtesans.

00:11:54.255 --> 00:11:56.966 position:50% align:center
I vowed to chop you
villains to bits...

00:11:57.050 --> 00:12:00.053 position:50% align:center
...and use you as
grist in that mill.

00:12:00.136 --> 00:12:03.973 position:50% align:center
Who are you? I doubt
you're from the workshop.

00:12:07.852 --> 00:12:09.729 position:50% align:center
Arthur's sword got
a lot stronger.

00:12:09.813 --> 00:12:10.980 position:50% align:center
More than it's ever been!

00:12:11.064 --> 00:12:13.900 position:50% align:center
Huh? So it actually worked?

00:12:13.983 --> 00:12:15.402 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
Huh?

00:12:18.697 --> 00:12:20.699 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
Ride forth, Silver!

00:12:20.782 --> 00:12:23.118 position:50% align:center
In the name of
the round table...

00:12:24.911 --> 00:12:26.454 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
...I smite thee!

00:12:26.538 --> 00:12:28.832 position:50% align:center
Excalibur!

00:12:30.208 --> 00:12:32.002 position:50% align:center
What was that attack?

00:12:34.546 --> 00:12:36.631 position:50% align:center
[MIRAGE]
My shimmers!

00:12:36.715 --> 00:12:41.469 position:50% align:center
All those troops, I cut through
them like so much papier-mache.

00:12:41.553 --> 00:12:43.346 position:50% align:center
Guess the workshop
hired a fighter.

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:46.016 position:50% align:center
Strange that we weren't
let in on that fact.

00:12:46.099 --> 00:12:48.309 position:50% align:center
All right, punk.
State your name.

00:12:48.393 --> 00:12:50.520 position:50% align:center
I am the Knight King,
Arthur Boyle!

00:12:50.603 --> 00:12:53.106 position:50% align:center
Second Class Fire
Soldier of the 8th.

00:12:53.189 --> 00:12:55.442 position:50% align:center
You've met your match, kid.

00:12:58.111 --> 00:13:02.115 position:50% align:center
[MIRAGE] Stay on guard.
The will of his flame is strong.

00:13:02.198 --> 00:13:03.241 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:13:12.792 --> 00:13:14.377 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:13:16.129 --> 00:13:19.924 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN] Holy crap.
That idiot's a powerhouse.

00:13:20.008 --> 00:13:22.427 position:50% align:center
[IRIS, YU, LISA gasp]

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:26.306 position:50% align:center
When a knight and his steed
fight as one, they can't lose.

00:13:36.316 --> 00:13:37.942 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:13:41.988 --> 00:13:43.365 position:50% align:center
Though there be many of you,

00:13:43.448 --> 00:13:45.950 position:50% align:center
I'll hold strong
and let none pass.

00:13:46.034 --> 00:13:48.578 position:50% align:center
You might look
completely ridiculous,

00:13:48.661 --> 00:13:51.164 position:50% align:center
but you've got strength.

00:13:51.247 --> 00:13:55.335 position:50% align:center
Does my knightly garb look silly
to a foul bandit such as you?

00:13:56.461 --> 00:13:57.962 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
These are fakes!

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:05.178 position:50% align:center
[ARTHURS]
Surrender at once. You've lost.

00:14:05.261 --> 00:14:06.221 position:50% align:center
[DONKEY]
Huh?

00:14:06.304 --> 00:14:07.555 position:50% align:center
[DONKEY B]
Huh?

00:14:07.639 --> 00:14:09.391 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
Hm?

00:14:09.474 --> 00:14:10.600 position:50% align:center
[ARTHURS]
Good grief.

00:14:10.684 --> 00:14:12.560 position:50% align:center
Who would wear such
a ridiculous costume?

00:14:12.644 --> 00:14:13.603 position:50% align:center
Seems you would.

00:14:13.687 --> 00:14:15.271 position:50% align:center
[ARTHURS]
Huh?

00:14:15.355 --> 00:14:18.733 position:50% align:center
Wait, that's me? No way.

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:35.542 position:50% align:center
This is so un-knightly.

00:14:39.254 --> 00:14:42.007 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:44.134 position:50% align:center
Upon closer inspection,

00:14:44.217 --> 00:14:48.513 position:50% align:center
my steed looks more like
a donkey than a horse.

00:14:53.935 --> 00:14:56.187 position:50% align:center
Hey, what happened?

00:14:56.271 --> 00:14:59.107 position:50% align:center
It sounds like Arthur's
not doing too well.

00:15:02.652 --> 00:15:05.196 position:50% align:center
No. Silver.

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:08.283 position:50% align:center
The hell are you doin'?
This some kinda joke?

00:15:08.366 --> 00:15:10.785 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:15:10.869 --> 00:15:15.206 position:50% align:center
You can bust my poor ass,
but you can't break my will!

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:18.126 position:50% align:center
[MIRAGE] His power's
been greatly reduced.

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:22.339 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
You'll pay for this.

00:15:24.591 --> 00:15:27.510 position:50% align:center
Looks like the guys out
back were illusions, too.

00:15:27.594 --> 00:15:30.096 position:50% align:center
Lisa! Yu! This is your chance!

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:32.223 position:50% align:center
Go make a run for it.

00:15:32.307 --> 00:15:35.101 position:50% align:center
You there, from the 8th,
go with them, all right?

00:15:35.185 --> 00:15:36.686 position:50% align:center
Get them to safety.

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:38.688 position:50% align:center
What're you gonna do?

00:15:38.772 --> 00:15:41.149 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN] It's me the guys
in white are after, right?

00:15:41.232 --> 00:15:43.318 position:50% align:center
So your chances are
better if we split.

00:15:43.401 --> 00:15:46.237 position:50% align:center
No way. We are not gonna
ditch you to save ourselves!

00:15:46.321 --> 00:15:48.239 position:50% align:center
If we're leaving,
then you should, too!

00:15:48.323 --> 00:15:50.742 position:50% align:center
You said that we're
a family, right?

00:15:53.995 --> 00:15:57.457 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN] Idiot or not, that guy
out there is fighting for me.

00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:59.834 position:50% align:center
I can't just up and abandon him.

00:15:59.918 --> 00:16:02.921 position:50% align:center
[LISA] Why are these people
after you anyway?

00:16:03.004 --> 00:16:06.925 position:50% align:center
If you want me to run,
then at least tell me that much.

00:16:07.008 --> 00:16:08.426 position:50% align:center
Couldn't tell ya.

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:11.846 position:50% align:center
Look, all I know is that
Haijima took everything

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:13.932 position:50% align:center
my ancestors had.

00:16:14.015 --> 00:16:16.935 position:50% align:center
Their achievements
and their lives.

00:16:17.018 --> 00:16:18.478 position:50% align:center
Achievements?

00:16:18.561 --> 00:16:20.397 position:50% align:center
Yeah. That's right.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.399 position:50% align:center
Through a combination
of tech, hard work,

00:16:22.482 --> 00:16:26.152 position:50% align:center
and straight-up genius,
they built something great.

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:30.990 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN] Amaterasu,
our perpetual power plant.

00:16:32.617 --> 00:16:35.912 position:50% align:center
Now go. I built something
for this kinda situation.

00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:38.540 position:50% align:center
Use it to run. Even split up.

00:16:38.623 --> 00:16:41.418 position:50% align:center
This family of ours
is unbreakable.

00:16:41.501 --> 00:16:43.044 position:50% align:center
Vulcan.

00:16:45.338 --> 00:16:49.217 position:50% align:center
Hey. I'm sorry, but please
take care of them for me.

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:51.636 position:50% align:center
I'm not strong,
but I'm a Fire Soldier.

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:53.513 position:50% align:center
You can count on me.

00:17:01.312 --> 00:17:03.398 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
The hell was that for?

00:17:05.316 --> 00:17:07.986 position:50% align:center
Wait a sec.
What're you doing, Lisa?

00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:12.073 position:50% align:center
Yu, shut up and don't move.

00:17:12.157 --> 00:17:14.242 position:50% align:center
You either.

00:17:14.325 --> 00:17:16.745 position:50% align:center
Try anything funny
and I'll kill him.

00:17:16.828 --> 00:17:19.789 position:50% align:center
I didn't just wander into
your scrapyard, Vulcan.

00:17:19.873 --> 00:17:21.666 position:50% align:center
I was sent there.

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:25.962 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
What? Why?

00:17:26.046 --> 00:17:27.797 position:50% align:center
[LISA]
So I could earn your trust

00:17:27.881 --> 00:17:30.342 position:50% align:center
and steal something from you.

00:17:30.425 --> 00:17:32.719 position:50% align:center
Hand over the key to Amaterasu.

00:17:32.802 --> 00:17:35.638 position:50% align:center
To Amaterasu?

00:17:35.722 --> 00:17:38.808 position:50% align:center
What key? I don't have one.

00:17:40.352 --> 00:17:43.271 position:50% align:center
I am a servant of
the Evangelist.

00:17:43.355 --> 00:17:46.358 position:50% align:center
You thought we were
an unbreakable family?

00:17:46.441 --> 00:17:49.110 position:50% align:center
I was ordered to play
house with you.

00:17:49.194 --> 00:17:51.988 position:50% align:center
This has been broken
from the start.

00:17:55.367 --> 00:17:58.411 position:50% align:center
No. Is that true?

00:17:58.495 --> 00:18:00.121 position:50% align:center
You're lying.

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:06.628 position:50% align:center
Please stop. Don't hurt him!

00:18:06.711 --> 00:18:09.130 position:50% align:center
Giovanni is heading this way.

00:18:09.214 --> 00:18:10.840 position:50% align:center
If you don't cough up
that key right now,

00:18:10.924 --> 00:18:12.676 position:50% align:center
you're a dead man.

00:18:12.759 --> 00:18:14.636 position:50% align:center
Yeah? Why the warning?

00:18:14.719 --> 00:18:17.639 position:50% align:center
It almost sounds like
you're worried about me.

00:18:17.722 --> 00:18:20.475 position:50% align:center
Just how gullible can you get?

00:18:24.896 --> 00:18:26.648 position:50% align:center
[MIRAGE]
Wrong again.

00:18:26.731 --> 00:18:27.607 position:50% align:center
Damn!

00:18:27.691 --> 00:18:29.275 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
Don't let anyone in.

00:18:29.359 --> 00:18:30.652 position:50% align:center
[MIRAGE]
Understood, sir.

00:18:30.735 --> 00:18:32.821 position:50% align:center
You shall not pass!

00:18:39.411 --> 00:18:42.372 position:50% align:center
Looks like the shoe's
on the other foot now.

00:18:42.455 --> 00:18:45.667 position:50% align:center
We're the ones who aren't gonna
let you into that workshop.

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:47.585 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR growls]

00:18:49.796 --> 00:18:53.591 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] Stand down, Lisa.
I'll take it from here.

00:18:53.675 --> 00:18:55.760 position:50% align:center
You have two options, Vulcan.

00:18:55.844 --> 00:18:57.178 position:50% align:center
You can die this instant,

00:18:57.262 --> 00:19:00.432 position:50% align:center
or you can tell me
where the key is first.

00:19:00.515 --> 00:19:01.850 position:50% align:center
Choose.

00:19:01.933 --> 00:19:04.436 position:50% align:center
Giovanni.

00:19:04.519 --> 00:19:07.772 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] Has Lisa told you yet
how she was planted here?

00:19:07.856 --> 00:19:10.900 position:50% align:center
You bleeding hearts
are too trusting.

00:19:10.984 --> 00:19:13.528 position:50% align:center
That's why you're
so easy to deceive.

00:19:13.611 --> 00:19:15.321 position:50% align:center
You should learn to
knock on the bridge

00:19:15.405 --> 00:19:17.949 position:50% align:center
before stepping forward.

00:19:18.033 --> 00:19:22.662 position:50% align:center
Did you enjoy playing
house with Lisa?

00:19:22.746 --> 00:19:25.081 position:50% align:center
That might be why you
first came here, Lisa,

00:19:25.165 --> 00:19:27.000 position:50% align:center
but I know the rest was real.

00:19:27.083 --> 00:19:30.420 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] You must've inherited
that stubborn foolishness.

00:19:30.503 --> 00:19:33.214 position:50% align:center
Your ancestors were
just as naive.

00:19:33.298 --> 00:19:35.175 position:50% align:center
Make a simple appeal
to their emotions

00:19:35.258 --> 00:19:37.302 position:50% align:center
and they'd all turn to mush.

00:19:37.385 --> 00:19:39.637 position:50% align:center
Your father was no exception.

00:19:39.721 --> 00:19:44.726 position:50% align:center
You come from generation after
generation of gullible buffoons.

00:19:44.809 --> 00:19:46.686 position:50% align:center
But credulous as they were,

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:49.981 position:50% align:center
even they knew to be cautious
with their masterpiece.

00:19:50.065 --> 00:19:53.735 position:50% align:center
When your forefathers concealed
the key to Amaterasu,

00:19:53.818 --> 00:19:55.695 position:50% align:center
they knocked on the bridge.

00:19:55.779 --> 00:19:59.491 position:50% align:center
I'm not hiding anything,
all right? I don't have a key!

00:19:59.574 --> 00:20:00.950 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:02.952 --> 00:20:04.704 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] Was this child
a part of your little

00:20:04.788 --> 00:20:06.956 position:50% align:center
make-believe family?

00:20:08.667 --> 00:20:10.085 position:50% align:center
Let him go!

00:20:12.545 --> 00:20:15.298 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
Where is the key to Amaterasu?

00:20:15.382 --> 00:20:17.634 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
Damn you, Giovanni!

00:20:20.512 --> 00:20:24.140 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
Tell me. Do you remember now?

00:20:26.601 --> 00:20:28.395 position:50% align:center
No! Yu!

00:20:28.478 --> 00:20:29.854 position:50% align:center
I'm coming!

00:20:33.024 --> 00:20:34.859 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] It's a
life-threatening wound,

00:20:34.943 --> 00:20:38.154 position:50% align:center
but act now, and he
may yet be saved.

00:20:40.532 --> 00:20:42.158 position:50% align:center
Stop. He's just a kid.

00:20:42.242 --> 00:20:44.869 position:50% align:center
Please! Cut the crap
and save him!

00:20:44.953 --> 00:20:46.830 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] You're the
one who got him hurt

00:20:46.913 --> 00:20:50.458 position:50% align:center
when you refused to tell
me what I want to know.

00:20:50.542 --> 00:20:52.419 position:50% align:center
Where is the key?

00:20:52.502 --> 00:20:54.629 position:50% align:center
Look, I don't have a key.

00:20:54.713 --> 00:20:56.881 position:50% align:center
If I did, I would hand it over.

00:20:56.965 --> 00:21:01.219 position:50% align:center
Please! Don't take
anything else from us.

00:21:01.302 --> 00:21:03.638 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] I've made
meticulous preparations.

00:21:03.722 --> 00:21:06.641 position:50% align:center
Gone out of my way to
recruit you peacefully.

00:21:06.725 --> 00:21:08.810 position:50% align:center
Sent a spy to your home.

00:21:08.893 --> 00:21:12.063 position:50% align:center
Cut off your supply
of materials and more.

00:21:12.147 --> 00:21:13.440 position:50% align:center
I have knocked and
knocked and knocked

00:21:13.523 --> 00:21:14.941 position:50% align:center
and tapped and tapped
and beat and beat

00:21:15.025 --> 00:21:16.943 position:50% align:center
and smashed and slammed
and thrashed and bashed

00:21:17.027 --> 00:21:19.029 position:50% align:center
and torn into this bridge
with bleeding hands!

00:21:19.112 --> 00:21:21.197 position:50% align:center
And you claim that
you know nothing?!

00:21:21.281 --> 00:21:22.532 position:50% align:center
Damn you, Vulcan!

00:21:22.615 --> 00:21:25.201 position:50% align:center
As dumb as you all are,
you knew to hide that key,

00:21:25.285 --> 00:21:26.786 position:50% align:center
and that's why this
is happening!

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:29.289 position:50% align:center
Your family tree is filled
with rotten apples!

00:21:29.372 --> 00:21:31.416 position:50% align:center
You're all as gullible
as you are brilliant.

00:21:31.499 --> 00:21:32.584 position:50% align:center
You disgust me!

00:21:32.667 --> 00:21:36.129 position:50% align:center
I'll kill you, Giovanni!
Go to hell!

00:21:37.255 --> 00:21:39.382 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] I have knocked and
tapped and beat and slammed

00:21:39.466 --> 00:21:41.259 position:50% align:center
and bashed and thrashed
and torn into this bridge

00:21:41.343 --> 00:21:43.511 position:50% align:center
with bleeding hands
to find that key!

00:21:43.595 --> 00:21:44.637 position:50% align:center
But I shouldn't have.

00:21:44.721 --> 00:21:46.056 position:50% align:center
I should've knocked
down your door

00:21:46.139 --> 00:21:47.432 position:50% align:center
and bashed and bashed and bashed

00:21:47.515 --> 00:21:49.142 position:50% align:center
and bashed and bashed
and bashed and bashed

00:21:49.225 --> 00:21:52.479 position:50% align:center
and bashed and bashed you with
this cane to make you talk!

00:21:58.151 --> 00:21:59.903 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
Damn fool.

00:21:59.986 --> 00:22:02.822 position:50% align:center
Does he truly not
know where it is?

00:22:05.492 --> 00:22:07.035 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
Why does he so treasure

00:22:07.118 --> 00:22:09.871 position:50% align:center
these worthless pieces of junk?

00:22:13.667 --> 00:22:16.795 position:50% align:center
[clanking]

00:22:16.878 --> 00:22:18.213 position:50% align:center
Don't do this.

00:22:18.296 --> 00:22:19.673 position:50% align:center
Please.

00:22:28.348 --> 00:22:30.975 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
It's breaking...

00:22:31.059 --> 00:22:33.728 position:50% align:center
It's all broken.
