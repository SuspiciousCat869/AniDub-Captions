[OBI] Causes of death
are many and varied.

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:25.734 position:50% align:center
Old age. Illness. Suicide.

00:00:25.817 --> 00:00:27.527 position:50% align:center
But out of that long,
morbid list,

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.281 position:50% align:center
there's one end that people
fear above all others...

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:37.245 position:50% align:center line:10%
[OBI]
Death by fire.

[CITIZENS shouting]

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:48.673 position:50% align:center
[CITIZEN A]
Don't touch me!

00:00:48.757 --> 00:00:49.466 position:50% align:center
[7TH CREWMAN A]
We're trying to help you!

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:50.592 position:50% align:center
Please, just evacuate!

00:00:50.675 --> 00:00:51.718 position:50% align:center
[CITIZEN A]
Shut your trap!

00:00:51.801 --> 00:00:54.471 position:50% align:center
I'm not listening
to a word you say!

00:00:55.472 --> 00:00:58.141 position:50% align:center
When people are faced
with a disaster,

00:00:58.224 --> 00:01:01.686 position:50% align:center
only about ten percent manage
to do the right thing.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.980 position:50% align:center
Twenty percent panic and
end up doing something

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:06.024 position:50% align:center
that makes matters worse.

00:01:06.107 --> 00:01:10.695 position:50% align:center
And the remaining 70 freeze,
struck motionless by shock.

00:01:12.197 --> 00:01:13.615 position:50% align:center
You get it?

00:01:13.698 --> 00:01:16.659 position:50% align:center
In times like these, people
need a leader to guide them.

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:18.787 position:50% align:center
You're the one who
can tame this chaos

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.623 position:50% align:center
and protect the people here.

00:01:21.706 --> 00:01:24.334 position:50% align:center
Destroyer of Asakusa.

00:01:29.881 --> 00:01:31.591 position:50% align:center
Konro!

00:01:31.675 --> 00:01:32.926 position:50% align:center
Been looking all over for you.

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:34.928 position:50% align:center
It's a mess. Sorry.

00:01:35.011 --> 00:01:38.139 position:50% align:center
New Infernals keep popping up.
Same with the street fights.

00:01:38.223 --> 00:01:40.183 position:50% align:center
Everybody's arguing
about everything.

00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:42.435 position:50% align:center
There's no way to find
out what's going on.

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:45.105 position:50% align:center
We think the enemy is
altering people's faces.

00:01:45.188 --> 00:01:46.439 position:50% align:center
That's a start.

00:01:46.523 --> 00:01:48.733 position:50% align:center
But don't tell me--
tell the people down there!

00:01:48.817 --> 00:01:51.361 position:50% align:center
They won't listen to each other,
but they'll listen to you!

00:01:51.444 --> 00:01:54.989 position:50% align:center
We can't let this get worse!
You gotta give 'em a speech!

00:01:55.073 --> 00:01:58.576 position:50% align:center
Even if I could do that, I'm not
the one they're waiting for.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.537 position:50% align:center
They need someone
with authority.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.123 position:50% align:center
They need a hotshot to grind
this chaos under his heel

00:02:03.206 --> 00:02:04.290 position:50% align:center
and take the city back!

00:02:04.374 --> 00:02:06.793 position:50% align:center
I know. Why do you
think I came to you?

00:02:06.876 --> 00:02:08.878 position:50% align:center
You're the one we
need right now!

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:10.213 position:50% align:center
You've got a level head.

00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:12.090 position:50% align:center
If you tell people to calm
down, they'll listen!

00:02:12.173 --> 00:02:13.633 position:50% align:center
What's the issue?

00:02:13.717 --> 00:02:17.804 position:50% align:center
Waka, I'm sick of hearing
you talk like that.

00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:29.357 position:50% align:center
You don't have to defer to me--
you've become a strong leader.

00:02:29.441 --> 00:02:32.652 position:50% align:center
Show 'em some guts.
I know you got it in you.

00:02:33.778 --> 00:02:35.905 position:50% align:center
Remember, no matter
what goes down here,

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.283 position:50% align:center
Asakusa is your town.

00:02:41.453 --> 00:02:43.663 position:50% align:center
The people aren't
waiting for me.

00:02:43.747 --> 00:02:47.000 position:50% align:center
It's Beni who's gonna show
everyone how this is done.

00:02:55.592 --> 00:02:59.095 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU] All right,
Konro. Get off the tower.

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:00.889 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir.

00:03:02.265 --> 00:03:03.725 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU]
But I'm warning you.

00:03:03.808 --> 00:03:07.437 position:50% align:center
A guy like me can't do anything
but tear things down.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.023 position:50% align:center
That's the best you can expect.

00:03:13.693 --> 00:03:16.071 position:50% align:center
Time for me to bring the pain.

00:04:59.174 --> 00:05:02.719 position:50% align:center

Please, keep screaming!

00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:06.723 position:50% align:center
Delicious mayhem.

00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:09.309 position:50% align:center
Chaos! So beautiful!

00:05:09.392 --> 00:05:11.227 position:50% align:center
This is a work of art.

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:14.064 position:50% align:center
A tribute to madness,
brilliantly rendered.

00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:15.899 position:50% align:center
By yours truly, of course.

00:05:15.982 --> 00:05:18.693 position:50% align:center
All that's left is to
bask in its glory!

[YONA yelps]

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:22.280 position:50% align:center
What was that?

Benimaru!

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.081 position:50% align:center
What now?

00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:32.832 position:50% align:center
[CITIZEN H]
Finally!

00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:35.043 position:50% align:center
That's a watchtower.

00:05:35.126 --> 00:05:37.796 position:50% align:center
Quite the showoff, isn't he?

00:05:45.053 --> 00:05:50.600 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU]
Do you hear me, Asakusa?!

00:05:54.104 --> 00:05:57.065 position:50% align:center
[CITIZENS]
Yeah!

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.112 position:50% align:center
Our town is under attack!

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:05.448 position:50% align:center
This is the work of outside
forces, not your neighbors!

00:06:05.532 --> 00:06:08.410 position:50% align:center
They've stolen our faces to
turn us against each other!

00:06:08.493 --> 00:06:12.038 position:50% align:center
Asakusa is overrun
with imposters!

00:06:13.164 --> 00:06:14.290 position:50% align:center
There's no way for us to tell

00:06:14.374 --> 00:06:16.960 position:50% align:center
who's the real deal
and who's a fake!

00:06:17.043 --> 00:06:20.088 position:50% align:center
In other words, there's not
a damn thing we can do!

00:06:20.171 --> 00:06:24.342 position:50% align:center
So what? Do you really think
I'm gonna let that stop me?

00:06:24.426 --> 00:06:27.053 position:50% align:center
That's right! You tell 'em!
You're the boss here!

00:06:27.137 --> 00:06:28.722 position:50% align:center
Hell yeah! I knew
he'd have a plan.

00:06:28.805 --> 00:06:30.348 position:50% align:center
We just had to hold
out long enough!

00:06:33.852 --> 00:06:36.646 position:50% align:center
He says a few words and
all tension melts away.

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:40.066 position:50% align:center
That man can really command
authority when he wants to.

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:42.402 position:50% align:center
Waka!

00:06:42.485 --> 00:06:44.446 position:50% align:center
What are your orders, sir?!

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:46.656 position:50% align:center
We stand ready!

Don't worry about
who's fake or real!

00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:03.548 position:50% align:center
The people of Asakusa won't
lose to a bunch of imposters!

00:07:03.631 --> 00:07:06.509 position:50% align:center
Don't worry about the fires
and the Infernals, either.

00:07:06.593 --> 00:07:09.846 position:50% align:center
Company 7 will
take care of that!

Haran.

Did that weirdo just eat
one of those fire bugs?

00:07:35.413 --> 00:07:38.917 position:50% align:center
We're in Asakusa.
This is a power spot.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.836 position:50% align:center
Another demon might appear.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:46.257 position:50% align:center
If that's the theory, I might
as well test it out on myself.

00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:52.472 position:50% align:center
[roars]

00:07:52.555 --> 00:07:54.099 position:50% align:center
He turned himself
into an Infernal

00:07:54.182 --> 00:07:56.017 position:50% align:center
without a second thought.

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:03.900 position:50% align:center
[ARROW]
Not just any Infernal.

00:08:03.983 --> 00:08:07.028 position:50% align:center
I'm sure his horns haven't
escaped your notice.

00:08:07.112 --> 00:08:08.863 position:50% align:center
He's a demon.

00:08:12.158 --> 00:08:13.410 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:08:18.164 --> 00:08:19.958 position:50% align:center
This is pure barbarism!

00:08:20.041 --> 00:08:22.502 position:50% align:center
Why, it isn't art at all!

00:08:26.172 --> 00:08:27.507 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA] Well, I'm sure
they're taking out

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:29.509 position:50% align:center
some of the imposters in there.

00:08:29.592 --> 00:08:31.720 position:50% align:center
[OBI] Should we start
punchin' each other, too?

00:08:31.803 --> 00:08:34.222 position:50% align:center

Tonight, your sparring
partners will be the fires!

Get to work and put 'em out!

[7TH CREWMEN]
Yes, sir!

00:08:48.611 --> 00:08:51.948 position:50% align:center
Considering the mess we're all
in, you seem pretty happy, sir.

00:08:52.032 --> 00:08:54.909 position:50% align:center
Everything is coming
together just fine.

00:08:54.993 --> 00:08:58.955 position:50% align:center
Kept us waiting,
but we're in good hands.

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:08.506 position:50% align:center
One of them, huh?

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:11.760 position:50% align:center
It looks like I found my
partner for the big festival.

00:09:22.854 --> 00:09:25.982 position:50% align:center
No way. It looks the same.

That's an Adolla Link. Unreal.

You don't belong in the
Fire Force at all, do you?

00:10:05.355 --> 00:10:06.898 position:50% align:center
What'd you say?

00:10:06.981 --> 00:10:08.316 position:50% align:center
Listen well.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:12.821 position:50% align:center

to exterminate mankind.

help me or what?

you gotta go through me.

[ARTHUR] That was a
nice entrance and all,

00:10:59.242 --> 00:11:00.118 position:50% align:center
but I'd be careful.

00:11:00.201 --> 00:11:02.245 position:50% align:center
That's no normal Infernal.

I've seen one of these before.

Asakusa. A horned Infernal.

got his tephrosis.

Stand back, the both of
you. This one is mine.

00:11:53.588 --> 00:11:56.049 position:50% align:center
Useless. How am I supposed
to explain this to Hina?

00:11:56.132 --> 00:11:58.843 position:50% align:center
She'll make fun of me when
she finds out I got cheated.

00:11:58.927 --> 00:12:00.845 position:50% align:center
We finally found you, Hika!

00:12:00.929 --> 00:12:03.807 position:50% align:center
Some gross old dude
pretended to be you!

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:05.725 position:50% align:center
I bet these losers
are his friends.

00:12:05.809 --> 00:12:08.728 position:50% align:center
Huh? That means we can beat
the crap out of 'em, right?

00:12:08.812 --> 00:12:10.271 position:50% align:center
[BOTH giggling]

00:12:10.355 --> 00:12:12.357 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
"Hee-hee-hee"?

00:12:14.943 --> 00:12:17.070 position:50% align:center
[CAPTORS screaming]

00:12:17.153 --> 00:12:20.532 position:50% align:center
[CAPTORS]
I'm burning! Burning! My flesh!

00:12:20.615 --> 00:12:23.034 position:50% align:center
[CAPTORS screaming]

00:12:48.893 --> 00:12:52.522 position:50% align:center
He's taking whatever it throws
at him and tossing it aside!

00:13:00.321 --> 00:13:01.656 position:50% align:center
That one hurt.

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:04.617 position:50% align:center
You're as tough as
you look, aren't you?

00:13:04.701 --> 00:13:06.619 position:50% align:center
Konro had to blast a crater
into the ground

00:13:06.703 --> 00:13:09.122 position:50% align:center
to take out the last
demon that attacked.

00:13:09.205 --> 00:13:10.999 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna need at least
that much firepower

00:13:11.082 --> 00:13:12.709 position:50% align:center
to put you away, huh?

00:13:12.792 --> 00:13:15.628 position:50% align:center
I'll do it, in Konro's honor.

00:13:17.714 --> 00:13:18.715 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU]
Let's hope I don't blow up

00:13:18.798 --> 00:13:21.259 position:50% align:center
half the town in the process!

00:13:30.477 --> 00:13:34.147 position:50% align:center
I just needed a little more
space. Thanks for coming along.

00:13:35.565 --> 00:13:37.275 position:50% align:center
[KONRO]
Two Infernals at nine o'clock!

00:13:37.359 --> 00:13:39.194 position:50% align:center
At the intersection
100 ken away!

00:13:39.277 --> 00:13:40.278 position:50% align:center
[7TH CREWMAN D]
Yes, sir!

00:13:40.362 --> 00:13:41.279 position:50% align:center
[7TH CREWMAN E]
What's that?

00:13:41.363 --> 00:13:43.281 position:50% align:center
[7TH CREWMAN F]
It's the captain!

00:13:43.365 --> 00:13:44.783 position:50% align:center
The sky?

00:13:44.866 --> 00:13:48.453 position:50% align:center
Hoping to end the festival with
some fireworks, huh, Beni?

00:13:51.164 --> 00:13:53.833 position:50% align:center
They noticed! Not good!

00:13:53.917 --> 00:13:54.959 position:50% align:center
[ARROW]
He may be strong,

00:13:55.043 --> 00:13:57.087 position:50% align:center
but my arrow can
still shoot him down.

00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:58.546 position:50% align:center
I'm coming!

00:14:05.095 --> 00:14:08.139 position:50% align:center
[coughing]

00:14:09.391 --> 00:14:10.684 position:50% align:center
Beni.

00:14:14.145 --> 00:14:18.108 position:50% align:center
[KONRO] I can't do it.
I can't even move!

00:14:18.191 --> 00:14:21.903 position:50% align:center
Someone... protect him!

00:14:21.986 --> 00:14:26.741 position:50% align:center
Before you decide to throw your
life away, ask me to help you!

00:14:26.825 --> 00:14:28.785 position:50% align:center
[KONRO]
Save Beni.

00:14:28.868 --> 00:14:30.453 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:14:30.537 --> 00:14:34.332 position:50% align:center
Protect him, Shinra!

00:14:36.751 --> 00:14:40.672 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
My legs again. What was that?

00:14:40.755 --> 00:14:45.093 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Shinra. I appreciate
your perspective.

00:14:45.176 --> 00:14:47.554 position:50% align:center
Like he's telling me something.

00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:50.390 position:50% align:center
That flame.

00:14:50.473 --> 00:14:52.308 position:50% align:center
[ARROW]
I've got you.

00:14:52.392 --> 00:14:53.893 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
What's happening?

00:14:54.853 --> 00:14:56.521 position:50% align:center
No you don't!

00:14:58.398 --> 00:15:00.442 position:50% align:center
The Devil's Footprints.

00:15:02.444 --> 00:15:04.654 position:50% align:center
Just a little more!

00:15:19.669 --> 00:15:20.920 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU]
Hmph.

00:15:24.674 --> 00:15:26.134 position:50% align:center
He heard me?!

00:15:26.217 --> 00:15:28.219 position:50% align:center
[ARROW]
He is terribly fast, isn't he?

00:15:28.303 --> 00:15:31.306 position:50% align:center
He caught up to the
arrow just like that.

00:15:31.389 --> 00:15:32.932 position:50% align:center
No matter.

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:41.232 position:50% align:center
My shot will not stray from its
course, despite your strength.

00:15:41.316 --> 00:15:46.029 position:50% align:center
[yelling]

00:15:46.112 --> 00:15:50.283 position:50% align:center
Unreal. You don't belong in
the Fire Force at all, do you?

00:15:52.619 --> 00:15:53.953 position:50% align:center
[ARROW]
Listen well.

00:15:54.037 --> 00:15:57.916 position:50% align:center
Your flames are the fire meant
to exterminate mankind.

00:15:57.999 --> 00:16:00.335 position:50% align:center
Screw you, lady.

00:16:02.087 --> 00:16:05.799 position:50% align:center
My flames are the fire
that's gonna protect mankind!

00:16:08.802 --> 00:16:10.387 position:50% align:center
Shinra.

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:11.930 position:50% align:center
You got this!

00:16:12.013 --> 00:16:14.140 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:16:14.224 --> 00:16:15.225 position:50% align:center
Are they fighting?

00:16:15.308 --> 00:16:17.143 position:50% align:center
Up there in the sky?

00:16:17.227 --> 00:16:18.728 position:50% align:center
Like our commander,

00:16:18.812 --> 00:16:21.731 position:50% align:center
you possess the power
of an Adolla Burst.

00:16:21.815 --> 00:16:24.651 position:50% align:center
And yet you choose to be
a tool of the ignoble.

00:16:24.734 --> 00:16:27.195 position:50% align:center
Better to be a devil with us.

00:16:27.278 --> 00:16:30.323 position:50% align:center
And we can burn this
world to the ground.

00:16:30.407 --> 00:16:32.075 position:50% align:center
I don't care what
those creeps say--

00:16:32.158 --> 00:16:34.744 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna be the hero
who saves everyone!

00:16:34.828 --> 00:16:36.913 position:50% align:center
That's what this flame
is made to do!

00:16:36.996 --> 00:16:40.500 position:50% align:center
I'm Kick-This-Stupid-Arrow-
Thing-Out-Of-The-Way Man!

00:16:42.794 --> 00:16:44.421 position:50% align:center
No way.

00:16:45.672 --> 00:16:47.298 position:50% align:center
He did it!

00:16:49.884 --> 00:16:51.845 position:50% align:center
You okay, Captain?

00:16:51.928 --> 00:16:54.055 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'm almost done.

00:16:55.348 --> 00:16:57.475 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU] This should
be high enough, I think.

00:16:57.559 --> 00:17:00.520 position:50% align:center
[HARAN roars]

00:17:16.161 --> 00:17:18.997 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU]
Iai Chop, Form Seven.

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:20.582 position:50% align:center
Sun Wheel!

00:17:24.377 --> 00:17:27.047 position:50% align:center
That still didn't
crack you, huh?

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:29.007 position:50% align:center
All right, Captain,
let him have it!

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:30.633 position:50% align:center
We're all cheering for you!

00:17:30.717 --> 00:17:32.427 position:50% align:center
Come on! One more!

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:33.970 position:50% align:center
I don't care about
the Evangelist,

00:17:34.054 --> 00:17:35.847 position:50% align:center
or whoever you work for!

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:38.224 position:50% align:center
Don't you dare act like
you own this place!

00:17:38.308 --> 00:17:39.642 position:50% align:center
Asakusa is my town.

00:17:39.726 --> 00:17:42.270 position:50% align:center
You pick a fight here,
you answer to me!

00:17:42.354 --> 00:17:46.733 position:50% align:center
Show 'em, Beni. You got the
whole town cheering for you.

00:17:46.816 --> 00:17:50.403 position:50% align:center
I'm borrowing your
move. Sorry, Konro.

00:17:57.327 --> 00:17:59.537 position:50% align:center
A sight for sore eyes.

00:18:01.623 --> 00:18:03.667 position:50% align:center
[KONRO]
The Crimson Moon.

00:18:05.335 --> 00:18:08.463 position:50% align:center
[OBI] All that firepower
from one person? That's nuts.

00:18:08.546 --> 00:18:10.632 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA]
It was quite the technique.

00:18:10.715 --> 00:18:14.511 position:50% align:center
I gotta admit, the man sure does
live up to his reputation.

00:18:17.931 --> 00:18:22.060 position:50% align:center
[YONA] It's vexing, but there's
a hint of artistry in his work.

00:18:22.143 --> 00:18:25.188 position:50% align:center
It's not fair! I'm so jealous!

00:18:25.271 --> 00:18:27.691 position:50% align:center
[ARROW]
Yona, it's time to withdraw.

00:18:27.774 --> 00:18:30.443 position:50% align:center
We have to report this
to the commander.

00:18:30.527 --> 00:18:34.698 position:50% align:center
Now we know that a second demon
can be born in the same spot.

00:18:34.781 --> 00:18:38.118 position:50% align:center
This is invaluable information.

00:18:38.201 --> 00:18:43.248 position:50% align:center
Haran, for what it's worth,
your death was not in vain.

00:18:48.211 --> 00:18:50.213 position:50% align:center
That's so cool.

00:19:04.227 --> 00:19:07.897 position:50% align:center
Overdid it back there.
I'm all burnt out.

00:19:07.981 --> 00:19:10.400 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA chuckles]

00:19:10.483 --> 00:19:11.901 position:50% align:center
[7TH CREWMAN I]
Lieutenant Konro,

00:19:11.985 --> 00:19:13.445 position:50% align:center
all the fires have been put out.

00:19:13.528 --> 00:19:16.614 position:50% align:center
The Infernals have been
taken care of, too.

00:19:16.698 --> 00:19:18.783 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Splendid work.

00:19:18.867 --> 00:19:19.868 position:50% align:center
As soon as I can stand,

00:19:19.951 --> 00:19:22.537 position:50% align:center
I'll give my thanks
to Company 8.

00:19:24.122 --> 00:19:26.791 position:50% align:center
[KONRO]
Especially our friend Shinra.

00:21:02.804 --> 00:21:09.811 position:50% align:center
[CITIZENS,
7TH CREWMEN chattering]

00:21:09.894 --> 00:21:13.148 position:50% align:center
I can't believe they got all
this cleanup done overnight.

00:21:16.818 --> 00:21:18.611 position:50% align:center
Luckily, their "destroyer"
is just as good

00:21:18.695 --> 00:21:19.821 position:50% align:center
at repairing things.

00:21:19.904 --> 00:21:23.033 position:50% align:center
Otherwise, I don't think
he'd be so popular.

00:21:23.116 --> 00:21:24.534 position:50% align:center
[MAKI]
Captain!

00:21:24.617 --> 00:21:26.703 position:50% align:center
We looked into that company
that we believe is involved

00:21:26.786 --> 00:21:28.079 position:50% align:center
with the Evangelist.

00:21:28.163 --> 00:21:29.372 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
What'd you find?

00:21:29.456 --> 00:21:32.500 position:50% align:center
Their office burned down,
during all this chaos.

00:21:32.584 --> 00:21:34.878 position:50% align:center
Seems they were
burning evidence.

00:21:34.961 --> 00:21:37.047 position:50% align:center
So it sounds like they
were investigating us

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:39.299 position:50% align:center
while we were
investigating them?

00:21:39.382 --> 00:21:42.052 position:50% align:center
Man, we're a step
behind already.

00:21:42.135 --> 00:21:44.554 position:50% align:center
The whole town got
wrapped up in our fight.

00:21:44.637 --> 00:21:45.764 position:50% align:center
I don't like it.

00:21:45.847 --> 00:21:47.223 position:50% align:center
Let's hope they don't
resort to something

00:21:47.307 --> 00:21:49.768 position:50% align:center
even more drastic next time.

00:21:57.484 --> 00:21:59.194 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU]
Heading back to the Eighth, huh?

00:21:59.277 --> 00:22:01.321 position:50% align:center
Well, I appreciate the help.

00:22:01.404 --> 00:22:02.906 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Yeah, thanks!

00:22:02.989 --> 00:22:04.866 position:50% align:center
It's fine. This is
the least we could do.

00:22:04.949 --> 00:22:06.659 position:50% align:center
Especially since we
might have been the ones

00:22:06.743 --> 00:22:08.953 position:50% align:center
who started this mess
in the first place.

00:22:09.037 --> 00:22:10.288 position:50% align:center
Doesn't matter.

00:22:10.372 --> 00:22:12.457 position:50% align:center
The Evangelist's goons
were already hiding here;

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:14.250 position:50% align:center
you just brought them out.

00:22:14.334 --> 00:22:16.586 position:50% align:center
All the human combustion
our town has suffered,

00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:19.589 position:50% align:center
it might've been their
group's doing all along.

00:22:19.673 --> 00:22:22.258 position:50% align:center
Now we can put that behind us.

00:22:22.342 --> 00:22:24.010 position:50% align:center
Hmph.

00:22:24.094 --> 00:22:26.137 position:50% align:center
Konro, bring it here.

00:22:26.221 --> 00:22:27.305 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir.

00:22:27.389 --> 00:22:29.057 position:50% align:center
What's "it"?

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:31.309 position:50% align:center
I may dislike the
Imperial Fire Force,

00:22:31.393 --> 00:22:33.853 position:50% align:center
but Company 8 is pretty
all right in my book.

00:22:33.937 --> 00:22:35.647 position:50% align:center
Hey there, you big,
dumb muscle head.

00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:37.232 position:50% align:center
And your big dumb buddies.

00:22:37.315 --> 00:22:39.818 position:50% align:center
The next time you show up here,
you better bring us some candy,

00:22:39.901 --> 00:22:41.444 position:50% align:center
or we're gonna be real mad!

00:22:41.528 --> 00:22:44.155 position:50% align:center
And if the candy sucks,
we're gonna be double mad!

00:22:44.239 --> 00:22:46.366 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
We'll look forward to it!

00:22:49.244 --> 00:22:51.204 position:50% align:center
A bottle of saké?

00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:54.916 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU]
We exchange cups of saké

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.876 position:50% align:center
as a token of our
mutual friendship.

00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:01.256 position:50% align:center
It's an old Japanese tradition,
celebrating our bond.

00:23:01.339 --> 00:23:03.133 position:50% align:center
You don't like saké?

00:23:03.216 --> 00:23:04.759 position:50% align:center
I love it!

00:23:13.935 --> 00:23:15.854 position:50% align:center
So, does this mean
the 7th and the 8th

00:23:15.937 --> 00:23:18.565 position:50% align:center
are gonna be good
friends from now on?

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:22.652 position:50% align:center
Count on it.

00:23:22.736 --> 00:23:23.987 position:50% align:center
Is he smiling?

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:25.572 position:50% align:center
Like a real smile?

00:23:25.655 --> 00:23:27.490 position:50% align:center
I mean, I'm happy if he's happy,

00:23:27.574 --> 00:23:29.909 position:50% align:center
but it's kinda weird,
coming from him.

00:23:29.993 --> 00:23:32.871 position:50% align:center
When the Destroyer of Asakusa
gets a little booze in him,

00:23:32.954 --> 00:23:35.206 position:50% align:center
he can never seem
to stop smiling.

00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:38.126 position:50% align:center
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

00:23:38.209 --> 00:23:40.503 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Obi Akitaru.

00:23:40.587 --> 00:23:42.797 position:50% align:center
If anything comes up,
feel free to call me.

00:23:42.881 --> 00:23:46.426 position:50% align:center
I will! We're drinkin'
buddies now, after all!

00:23:46.509 --> 00:23:49.929 position:50% align:center
Here's to a healthy partnership!

00:23:50.013 --> 00:23:53.224 position:50% align:center
[OBI] Nope. I don't like
that smile one bit.

00:23:53.308 --> 00:23:55.727 position:50% align:center
Is that what it's
like when I smile?

00:23:55.810 --> 00:24:00.815 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:24:03.693 --> 00:24:06.696 position:50% align:center
Do you want me
to kill you? I will.
