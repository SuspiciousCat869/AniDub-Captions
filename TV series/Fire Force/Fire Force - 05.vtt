00:00:12.762 --> 00:00:15.265 position:50% align:center
[OBI] Causes of death
are many and varied.

00:00:15.348 --> 00:00:18.727 position:50% align:center
Old age. Illness. Suicide.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.520 position:50% align:center
But out of that long,
morbid list,

00:00:20.603 --> 00:00:24.107 position:50% align:center
there's one end that people
fear above all others...

00:00:27.152 --> 00:00:29.154 position:50% align:center line:10%
[OBI]
Death by fire.

00:01:14.783 --> 00:01:20.789 position:50% align:center
[inaudible]

00:01:46.898 --> 00:01:48.024 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:01:52.487 --> 00:01:54.489 position:50% align:center
Sister.

00:01:54.572 --> 00:01:56.116 position:50% align:center
[gasps] I, um--

00:01:56.199 --> 00:01:58.326 position:50% align:center
Crap, my bad.

00:01:59.703 --> 00:02:01.204 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Was she crying?

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:05.125 position:50% align:center
I really am sorry for intruding.

00:02:05.208 --> 00:02:06.876 position:50% align:center
Oh, no. You're okay.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.546 position:50% align:center
I'm not used to people
coming through this early.

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.424 position:50% align:center
Anyway, take care with
your training, Shinra.

00:02:12.507 --> 00:02:14.801 position:50% align:center
Thanks, I'll do that.

00:02:14.884 --> 00:02:17.053 position:50% align:center
[IRIS]
Well, see ya later.

00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:20.265 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA
Hey. Uh, Sister?

00:02:22.851 --> 00:02:25.770 position:50% align:center
Thought I'd ask:
Is something bothering you?

00:02:28.481 --> 00:02:30.316 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
I'm happy to help if I can.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.277 position:50% align:center
It's why I took this job.

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.575 position:50% align:center
Thank you for your concern.

00:04:20.844 --> 00:04:23.304 position:50% align:center
[OBI] After the dust-up you
had with them yesterday,

00:04:23.388 --> 00:04:27.225 position:50% align:center
this is probl'y obvious, but
Company 5 can't be trusted.

00:04:27.308 --> 00:04:28.560 position:50% align:center
We're looking into
their affairs,

00:04:28.643 --> 00:04:31.229 position:50% align:center
and it could come to blows.

00:04:31.312 --> 00:04:32.772 position:50% align:center
That's impressive, sir.

00:04:32.856 --> 00:04:35.358 position:50% align:center
Is this a new training regimen
you've come up with

00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:38.236 position:50% align:center
or some kind of performance art?

00:04:41.072 --> 00:04:42.407 position:50% align:center
Hinawa!

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.618 position:50% align:center
Recall that our primary
objective is to protect people

00:04:45.702 --> 00:04:48.371 position:50% align:center
by fighting Infernals and
putting them to rest.

00:04:48.455 --> 00:04:50.373 position:50% align:center
However, we can't
forget that the 8th

00:04:50.457 --> 00:04:51.958 position:50% align:center
has a hidden objective:

00:04:52.042 --> 00:04:54.252 position:50% align:center
To investigate suspicious crew
members within other companies

00:04:54.336 --> 00:04:57.756 position:50% align:center
and oppose the ones
guilty of misconduct.

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:58.798 position:50% align:center
It's just as the captain said...

00:04:58.882 --> 00:05:00.342 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
I'm so distracted by his cap

00:05:00.425 --> 00:05:02.302 position:50% align:center
that I can't hear
a word he's saying.

00:05:02.385 --> 00:05:04.346 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA]
...Company 5 lies squarely...

00:05:04.429 --> 00:05:06.097 position:50% align:center
More of those wretched griffins.

00:05:06.181 --> 00:05:08.516 position:50% align:center
Come to attack my
castle again, eh?

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.770 position:50% align:center
Someday you'll be rust
on Excalibur's blade.

00:05:11.853 --> 00:05:14.647 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Do you even understand
how your blade works?

00:05:14.731 --> 00:05:17.317 position:50% align:center
Yeah, how about you put a lid
on that knightly temper of yours

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.861 position:50% align:center
and leave those adorable
"griffins" alone?

00:05:19.944 --> 00:05:23.490 position:50% align:center
There are wildlife protection
laws for a reason, ya know.

00:05:23.573 --> 00:05:25.617 position:50% align:center
It's kinda funny hearing
you tell someone else

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.410 position:50% align:center
to control their temper.

00:05:27.494 --> 00:05:28.370 position:50% align:center
You have a point.

00:05:28.453 --> 00:05:29.662 position:50% align:center
Ninety percent of the time,

00:05:29.746 --> 00:05:31.998 position:50% align:center
Maki's just as cool-headed
as she is beautiful.

00:05:32.082 --> 00:05:34.793 position:50% align:center
It's a real shame about
the other ten percent.

00:05:34.876 --> 00:05:36.169 position:50% align:center
I'm trying, okay?

00:05:36.252 --> 00:05:36.878 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA, IRIS gasp]

00:05:36.961 --> 00:05:38.213 position:50% align:center
No idle chatter.

00:05:38.296 --> 00:05:40.507 position:50% align:center
We're in the middle of an
important meeting here.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:41.841 position:50% align:center
Shut your mouths and focus.

00:05:41.925 --> 00:05:43.885 position:50% align:center
Hey, Lieutenant,
I know you're kidding,

00:05:43.968 --> 00:05:46.179 position:50% align:center
but could you please not
point your gun at us?

00:05:46.262 --> 00:05:48.515 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA] What the hell made
you think I was kidding?

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.477 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA screams]

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.186 position:50% align:center
<i>LÃ¡tom</i> .

00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:54.771 position:50% align:center
Somebody get a doctor!

00:05:54.854 --> 00:05:57.607 position:50% align:center
My leg! It hurts!

00:05:57.691 --> 00:05:59.067 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.860 position:50% align:center
Less than it should, though.

00:06:00.944 --> 00:06:03.863 position:50% align:center
No way. An airgun?

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.951 position:50% align:center
No. It's very real.

00:06:08.034 --> 00:06:10.829 position:50% align:center
Lieutenant Hinawa is a
second-generation Fire Soldier,

00:06:10.912 --> 00:06:11.913 position:50% align:center
the same as I am.

00:06:11.996 --> 00:06:13.581 position:50% align:center
So he can't create fires,

00:06:13.665 --> 00:06:16.126 position:50% align:center
but he is able to control
them once they ignite.

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:17.752 position:50% align:center
He weakened the
gunpowder's explosion

00:06:17.836 --> 00:06:20.630 position:50% align:center
so the bullet would hit you
with non-lethal force.

00:06:24.342 --> 00:06:26.928 position:50% align:center
Fire Soldiers are versatile.
Hard to predict.

00:06:27.012 --> 00:06:31.016 position:50% align:center
Unlike the Infernals we fight,
humans use all sorts of tactics.

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:32.225 position:50% align:center
You should all keep
your wits about you

00:06:32.308 --> 00:06:33.727 position:50% align:center
when you fight them.

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.813 position:50% align:center
Excepting Arthur, of course,
since he has none.

00:06:36.896 --> 00:06:38.231 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR chuckles]

00:06:41.818 --> 00:06:44.279 position:50% align:center
Perhaps I'll get some
when I slay this dragon.

00:06:44.362 --> 00:06:48.116 position:50% align:center
You've got quite the
imagination, don't you?

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:49.701 position:50% align:center
Your training begins now.

00:06:49.784 --> 00:06:52.620 position:50% align:center
I'll drill you punks
into the floor.

00:06:52.704 --> 00:06:54.706 position:50% align:center
You're way too
focused on my fists.

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:57.375 position:50% align:center
Study your opponent's
whole body!

00:06:57.459 --> 00:06:58.918 position:50% align:center
Listen, Lieutenant.

00:06:59.002 --> 00:07:00.754 position:50% align:center
The thing is, someone in the 5th

00:07:00.837 --> 00:07:04.549 position:50% align:center
joked about burning civilians
and I can't let that slide.

00:07:04.632 --> 00:07:06.926 position:50% align:center
What's the deal with
that captain of theirs?

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:10.263 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA] Princess Hibana is a
third-generation Fire Soldier.

00:07:10.347 --> 00:07:12.640 position:50% align:center
She started out as a
recruit from Haijima

00:07:12.724 --> 00:07:15.977 position:50% align:center
and shot up the ranks
with astonishing speed.

00:07:16.061 --> 00:07:17.228 position:50% align:center
It looks like she did this

00:07:17.312 --> 00:07:19.522 position:50% align:center
through illegal
research on Infernals.

00:07:19.606 --> 00:07:22.233 position:50% align:center
All while selling
off her findings.

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:24.736 position:50% align:center
And these findings,

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:26.446 position:50% align:center
do you think they might
have anything to do

00:07:26.529 --> 00:07:28.198 position:50% align:center
with human combustion?

00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:30.158 position:50% align:center
She at least discovered
something big enough

00:07:30.241 --> 00:07:33.370 position:50% align:center
to turn a nobody into
a captain overnight.

00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:36.790 position:50% align:center
Whatever that might be, I'm sure
she'll have it documented.

00:07:36.873 --> 00:07:39.709 position:50% align:center
We'll search their base
through force if we must.

00:07:39.793 --> 00:07:42.754 position:50% align:center
Your feet and Arthur's
plasma can help with that.

00:07:42.837 --> 00:07:46.633 position:50% align:center
Forget the documents.
I'm in it just to smash them.

00:07:47.634 --> 00:07:52.430 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMOTO screaming]

00:07:52.514 --> 00:07:53.515 position:50% align:center
No more!

00:07:53.598 --> 00:07:55.558 position:50% align:center
It hurts so bad.
I'm beggin' you, stop!

00:07:55.642 --> 00:07:56.643 position:50% align:center
And why should I?

00:07:56.726 --> 00:07:58.311 position:50% align:center
You're gravel! Just gravel!

00:07:58.395 --> 00:07:59.854 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMOTO screaming]

00:07:59.938 --> 00:08:01.940 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA] Stop whining
and shut your mouth.

00:08:02.023 --> 00:08:03.316 position:50% align:center
I'm talking to your body.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.318 position:50% align:center
If there's anything about
you I don't know yet,

00:08:05.402 --> 00:08:06.695 position:50% align:center
it'll tell me soon.

00:08:06.778 --> 00:08:08.363 position:50% align:center
Those who aren't me
are just gravel,

00:08:08.446 --> 00:08:10.281 position:50% align:center
and that most certainly
goes for you.

00:08:10.365 --> 00:08:12.867 position:50% align:center
So why don't you pave
the way to my happiness?

00:08:12.951 --> 00:08:15.036 position:50% align:center
Repulsive dung.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.204 position:50% align:center
You gotta stop!

00:08:16.287 --> 00:08:17.789 position:50% align:center
Keep that up
and it'll come out!

00:08:17.872 --> 00:08:21.001 position:50% align:center
What do I care if you scream?
Your pain's meaningless to me!

00:08:21.084 --> 00:08:23.044 position:50% align:center
Because you're just dung
strewn with gravel,

00:08:23.128 --> 00:08:26.256 position:50% align:center
and I'm a powerful,
beautiful princess!

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:32.345 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA laughing]

00:08:37.892 --> 00:08:40.687 position:50% align:center
The flame is the soul's breath.

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:44.065 position:50% align:center
The black smoke is
the soul's release.

00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:48.862 position:50% align:center
Ashes thou wert and art,
may thy soul return...

00:08:48.945 --> 00:08:51.948 position:50% align:center
...to the great flame of fire.

00:08:52.032 --> 00:08:53.408 position:50% align:center
<i>LÃ¡tom</i> .

00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:22.771 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
That smile was strained.

00:09:22.854 --> 00:09:25.023 position:50% align:center
Of all people, I should know.

00:09:25.106 --> 00:09:27.442 position:50% align:center
Maybe it has to do
with the 5th.

00:09:31.196 --> 00:09:32.530 position:50% align:center
Hey, quick question.

00:09:32.614 --> 00:09:34.324 position:50% align:center
D you know if something's
going on with the Sister?

00:09:34.407 --> 00:09:35.658 position:50% align:center
What's that?

00:09:35.742 --> 00:09:38.370 position:50% align:center
The princess has named me
commander of the order?

00:09:38.453 --> 00:09:42.374 position:50% align:center
Guess that dumb imagination of
yours runs 24/7, doesn't it?

00:09:46.127 --> 00:09:49.130 position:50% align:center
So what's the deal? You think
the princess is in peril?

00:09:49.214 --> 00:09:51.883 position:50% align:center
Will you please stop calling
the Sister a princess?

00:09:51.966 --> 00:09:54.052 position:50% align:center
For real. You stopped with Maki.

00:09:54.135 --> 00:09:54.803 position:50% align:center
That's because
Maki's an ogress--

00:09:54.886 --> 00:09:56.346 position:50% align:center
Hey, you guys awake?

00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:57.597 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR snores]

00:09:57.681 --> 00:09:58.890 position:50% align:center
[MAKI]
Uh?

00:09:58.973 --> 00:10:00.809 position:50% align:center
Good evening, Maki. What's up?

00:10:00.892 --> 00:10:04.145 position:50% align:center
I was wondering if one of you
knew where Sister Iris was.

00:10:04.229 --> 00:10:05.480 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Huh?

00:10:12.946 --> 00:10:14.906 position:50% align:center
Apologies.

00:10:14.989 --> 00:10:16.157 position:50% align:center
[5TH SOLDIER A]
It's fine.

00:10:16.241 --> 00:10:18.159 position:50% align:center
But what's a Sister doing
here at this hour?

00:10:18.243 --> 00:10:20.370 position:50% align:center
[IRIS] I was actually hoping
to meet with your captain.

00:10:20.453 --> 00:10:22.914 position:50% align:center
[5TH SOLDIER A]
Uh. Doesn't seem likely.

00:10:22.997 --> 00:10:24.833 position:50% align:center
Say that Iris has
come to see her,

00:10:24.916 --> 00:10:28.503 position:50% align:center
and I think her response
might surprise you.

00:10:28.586 --> 00:10:32.382 position:50% align:center
Is there something you wanted,
my little miss have-not?

00:10:32.465 --> 00:10:34.509 position:50% align:center
[IRIS] I'm not sure what
exactly you're doing,

00:10:34.592 --> 00:10:37.303 position:50% align:center
but from what I've heard,
it sounds really dangerous.

00:10:37.387 --> 00:10:39.222 position:50% align:center
Furthermore, it's clear
that your research

00:10:39.305 --> 00:10:41.016 position:50% align:center
is corrupt and blasphemous.

00:10:41.099 --> 00:10:43.893 position:50% align:center
Are you defying the
great Sol on purpose?

00:10:46.146 --> 00:10:48.148 position:50% align:center
Sister, please.

00:10:48.231 --> 00:10:49.858 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA]
You've got some nerve

00:10:49.941 --> 00:10:52.402 position:50% align:center

in front of me!

[IRIS gasps]

00:10:58.366 --> 00:11:00.952 position:50% align:center
Why? I don't understand!

00:11:01.036 --> 00:11:02.871 position:50% align:center
The Sisters are used
by the Fire Force

00:11:02.954 --> 00:11:05.248 position:50% align:center
as nothing more than
window-dressing.

00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:07.917 position:50% align:center
And you've devoted your
life to that nonsense?

00:11:08.001 --> 00:11:11.421 position:50% align:center
Looks like you're just as
foolish as you've always been.

00:11:11.504 --> 00:11:14.382 position:50% align:center
Don't you talk to me about
your "great god Sol."

00:11:14.466 --> 00:11:16.509 position:50% align:center
You're praying to
the ghost of a dream.

00:11:16.593 --> 00:11:18.595 position:50% align:center
There's no god in this country.

00:11:18.678 --> 00:11:21.264 position:50% align:center
Hell, there's no god
in this whole world.

00:11:21.348 --> 00:11:24.726 position:50% align:center
Although there are a
few devils like myself.

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:27.228 position:50% align:center
[IRIS]
Devils.

00:11:39.199 --> 00:11:41.326 position:50% align:center
Using you as bait,
I'll lure the 8th here

00:11:41.409 --> 00:11:42.827 position:50% align:center
and grind them into dust.

00:11:42.911 --> 00:11:44.454 position:50% align:center
No!

00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:46.164 position:50% align:center
[alarm blaring]

00:11:46.247 --> 00:11:48.416 position:50% align:center
[5TH SOLDIER B] What was that?
Some kind of mortar?

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:49.376 position:50% align:center
[5TH SOLDIER C]
Think it's human,

00:11:49.459 --> 00:11:51.503 position:50% align:center
but they came from the sky.

00:11:51.586 --> 00:11:53.338 position:50% align:center
Who the hell are you?

00:11:53.421 --> 00:11:55.298 position:50% align:center
I'm a hero, of course.

00:11:55.382 --> 00:11:58.718 position:50% align:center
But specifically, I'm part
of Company 8th.

00:11:58.802 --> 00:12:02.389 position:50% align:center
You can call me Save-Sister-
Iris-by-Crushing-the-5th-Man.

00:12:38.758 --> 00:12:40.135 position:50% align:center
Pardon, Lieutenant!

00:12:40.218 --> 00:12:42.470 position:50% align:center
But isn't what we're doing
kinda reckless and illegal?

00:12:42.554 --> 00:12:44.180 position:50% align:center
We believe the 5th
has been carrying out

00:12:44.264 --> 00:12:46.474 position:50% align:center
some pretty shady
research at this facility,

00:12:46.558 --> 00:12:49.394 position:50% align:center
so I doubt they'll file
any police reports.

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:03.992 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA] Use those devil
feet to find the Sister.

00:13:04.075 --> 00:13:05.994 position:50% align:center
Maki and I'll handle
things here.

00:13:06.077 --> 00:13:08.413 position:50% align:center
You're gonna take on all
these guys by yourselves?

00:13:08.496 --> 00:13:11.249 position:50% align:center
Start tearing things up
inside as fast as you can.

00:13:11.332 --> 00:13:13.209 position:50% align:center
That'll give us some
breathing room.

00:13:13.293 --> 00:13:14.169 position:50% align:center
Go!

00:13:14.252 --> 00:13:15.795 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir.

00:13:15.879 --> 00:13:17.255 position:50% align:center
You go, too, Arthur.

00:13:17.339 --> 00:13:18.673 position:50% align:center
We'll watch your back!

00:13:18.757 --> 00:13:21.426 position:50% align:center
Just don't forget to watch
your own back, Lieutenant.

00:13:22.927 --> 00:13:24.846 position:50% align:center
Here he comes!

00:13:24.929 --> 00:13:26.056 position:50% align:center
[5TH SOLDIER C gasps]

00:13:30.268 --> 00:13:32.520 position:50% align:center
[5TH SOLDIER D yells]

00:13:32.604 --> 00:13:34.105 position:50% align:center
He's fast!

00:13:37.567 --> 00:13:38.568 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
Do not discount.

00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:40.320 position:50% align:center
That was the flat side.

00:13:43.823 --> 00:13:45.200 position:50% align:center
[5TH SOLDIER E yells]

00:13:47.535 --> 00:13:49.537 position:50% align:center
We can't just watch! Get him!

00:13:49.621 --> 00:13:53.333 position:50% align:center
You won't escape my discipline,
so don't you dare start running!

00:13:54.709 --> 00:13:55.835 position:50% align:center
[FIRE FORCE SOLDIERS yelling]

00:13:55.919 --> 00:13:57.170 position:50% align:center
[5TH SOLDIER G]
Run for it!

00:14:11.518 --> 00:14:13.186 position:50% align:center
[MAKI]
Not that this is anything new,

00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:15.605 position:50% align:center
but I feel like you show
more mercy to Infernals

00:14:15.689 --> 00:14:17.941 position:50% align:center
than you do to people
sometimes, Lieutenant.

00:14:18.024 --> 00:14:20.068 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA] I didn't join
the Special Fire Force,

00:14:20.151 --> 00:14:22.445 position:50% align:center
I joined Captain
Obi's Company 8.

00:14:22.529 --> 00:14:24.364 position:50% align:center
I did it 'cause I wanted
to knock some heads,

00:14:24.447 --> 00:14:27.200 position:50% align:center
and force certain idiots
to listen to reason.

00:14:27.283 --> 00:14:29.411 position:50% align:center
You should start
knocking heads, too.

00:14:29.494 --> 00:14:31.079 position:50% align:center
Knock 'em around
until someone gives up

00:14:31.162 --> 00:14:34.040 position:50% align:center
that research data on
spontaneous combustion.

00:14:34.124 --> 00:14:36.876 position:50% align:center
I left the Military and joined
up with the Special Fire Force

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.253 position:50% align:center
against my father's wishes

00:14:38.336 --> 00:14:40.839 position:50% align:center
because I'd rather save
people than fight them.

00:14:40.922 --> 00:14:44.009 position:50% align:center
So I'm not too keen on
man-to-man combat.

00:14:44.092 --> 00:14:45.135 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA]
Didn't seem that way

00:14:45.218 --> 00:14:46.928 position:50% align:center
when you hit that
rookie from the 5th.

00:14:47.012 --> 00:14:50.515 position:50% align:center
[MAKI] That was just a tap.
It doesn't count.

00:14:50.598 --> 00:14:53.935 position:50% align:center
I have to admit, that Devil's
quick when he wants to be.

00:14:54.019 --> 00:14:56.354 position:50% align:center
Wish I could see
which way he went.

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:03.278 position:50% align:center
Look at that.
The Devil's footprints.

00:15:03.361 --> 00:15:05.488 position:50% align:center
[CONEHEAD chuckles]

00:15:05.572 --> 00:15:07.032 position:50% align:center
I take it that you're
trying to follow

00:15:07.115 --> 00:15:09.284 position:50% align:center
the Devil's Footprints as well.

00:15:09.367 --> 00:15:12.162 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR] It's dangerous here.
Back to your farm, old man.

00:15:12.245 --> 00:15:14.414 position:50% align:center
Lest your head be
damaged even worse.

00:15:14.497 --> 00:15:16.207 position:50% align:center
[CONEHEAD] I can't allow
you to snoop around

00:15:16.291 --> 00:15:18.501 position:50% align:center
my company's base.

00:15:19.753 --> 00:15:21.463 position:50% align:center
I'll roast you alive.

00:15:21.546 --> 00:15:23.506 position:50% align:center
Not you again.

00:15:25.592 --> 00:15:27.344 position:50% align:center
[CONEHEAD]
By administering a special drug

00:15:27.427 --> 00:15:28.595 position:50% align:center
I've been developing,

00:15:28.678 --> 00:15:31.431 position:50% align:center
I've boosted this
Infernal's firepower.

00:15:31.514 --> 00:15:32.724 position:50% align:center
I'm quite pleased to have had

00:15:32.807 --> 00:15:35.101 position:50% align:center
such a fine specimen
to work with.

00:15:35.185 --> 00:15:37.354 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
We meet again, Manslayer.

00:15:37.437 --> 00:15:39.981 position:50% align:center
By this sword, you'll soon...

00:15:40.065 --> 00:15:41.858 position:50% align:center
By this very sword--

00:15:41.941 --> 00:15:44.319 position:50% align:center
This sword will soon...

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.163 position:50% align:center
[KISHIRI]
Those punks from the 8th

00:15:55.246 --> 00:15:57.665 position:50% align:center
are way too full of themselves.

00:15:59.834 --> 00:16:01.086 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA]
What's that?

00:16:02.253 --> 00:16:04.506 position:50% align:center
Crap. Stay back, Lieutenant!

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:10.970 position:50% align:center
[MAKI]
That was some real firepower.

00:16:11.054 --> 00:16:14.015 position:50% align:center
'Course it is. Damn nobody.

00:16:14.099 --> 00:16:15.725 position:50% align:center
[KISHIRI] I just blow
some flammable gas

00:16:15.809 --> 00:16:17.852 position:50% align:center
into my oxygen-free bubble gum,

00:16:17.936 --> 00:16:21.272 position:50% align:center
send it over to my target,
and pop the bubble.

00:16:21.356 --> 00:16:25.318 position:50% align:center
When the flammable gas
hits fresh oxygen...

00:16:25.402 --> 00:16:28.530 position:50% align:center
...it goes boom.

00:16:28.613 --> 00:16:29.864 position:50% align:center
And that's the magic behind

00:16:29.948 --> 00:16:33.785 position:50% align:center
Toru Kishiri's Backdraft
Bubblish Gum!

00:16:33.868 --> 00:16:36.413 position:50% align:center
Another. Another! Another!

00:16:38.289 --> 00:16:42.127 position:50% align:center
Hey. Can you see where
they're coming from?

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:43.753 position:50% align:center
From inside that warehouse.

00:16:43.837 --> 00:16:46.006 position:50% align:center
I believe the target's
just around the corner.

00:16:46.089 --> 00:16:47.757 position:50% align:center
Though I can't be sure.

00:16:47.841 --> 00:16:49.509 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA]
I can work with that.

00:16:58.101 --> 00:17:00.562 position:50% align:center
Oh, gimme a break. What
the hell're you aiming at?

00:17:00.645 --> 00:17:02.605 position:50% align:center
I use the sparks
they create on impact

00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:05.150 position:50% align:center
to adjust each bullet's path.

00:17:09.821 --> 00:17:11.406 position:50% align:center
Uh-oh.

00:17:12.824 --> 00:17:14.659 position:50% align:center
[screaming]

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:23.626 position:50% align:center
How pathetic.

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:26.671 position:50% align:center
You'd need way more than
that to stop our rookies.

00:17:26.755 --> 00:17:29.132 position:50% align:center
Come on, let's persuade
these crewmen to tell us

00:17:29.215 --> 00:17:30.633 position:50% align:center
where the documents are.

00:17:30.717 --> 00:17:32.302 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:17:32.385 --> 00:17:33.678 position:50% align:center
[ANGEL A]
Hold it!

00:17:35.513 --> 00:17:37.599 position:50% align:center
The 5th Angels Three are here.

00:17:37.682 --> 00:17:39.726 position:50% align:center
--Let's fight!
--Attack!

00:17:39.809 --> 00:17:42.479 position:50% align:center
[CONEHEAD] Have you made
your peace yet, boy?

00:17:42.562 --> 00:17:44.647 position:50% align:center
The fact that I've found
you here all by yourself

00:17:44.731 --> 00:17:46.691 position:50% align:center
tells me the 8th
is as undermanned

00:17:46.775 --> 00:17:49.402 position:50% align:center
as our intel suggested.

00:17:49.486 --> 00:17:51.863 position:50% align:center
The Infernal I have
fortified through science

00:17:51.946 --> 00:17:55.867 position:50% align:center
will soon reduce you to cinders.

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:58.703 position:50% align:center
He's a cutting-edge weapon
that can condense his fire

00:17:58.787 --> 00:18:02.123 position:50% align:center
into one small point,
then release it!

00:18:04.334 --> 00:18:07.379 position:50% align:center
I don't wanna see
one trace of a body.

00:18:07.462 --> 00:18:09.005 position:50% align:center
That isn't gonna be a problem.

00:18:09.089 --> 00:18:10.298 position:50% align:center
'Cause thanks to that drug,

00:18:10.382 --> 00:18:13.009 position:50% align:center
the fire inside my
body is surging now!

00:18:13.093 --> 00:18:14.344 position:50% align:center
See for yourself!

00:18:14.427 --> 00:18:16.930 position:50% align:center
I'm about ready to explode!

00:18:23.019 --> 00:18:25.563 position:50% align:center
That was close.
What's goin' on here?

00:18:25.647 --> 00:18:27.607 position:50% align:center
Tryin' to cook some
knight teriyaki?

00:18:27.691 --> 00:18:29.150 position:50% align:center
Knight teriyaki?

00:18:29.234 --> 00:18:32.570 position:50% align:center
But you don't have any armor,
and I don't have any sauce!

00:18:35.365 --> 00:18:37.867 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR] I alight upon
this scorched red Earth.

00:18:37.951 --> 00:18:40.870 position:50% align:center
Clad in a raiment
of glorious gold!

00:18:40.954 --> 00:18:44.124 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMOTO] Huh? Then I guess
I'll make tempura!

00:18:46.126 --> 00:18:48.628 position:50% align:center
Come on, why even fight?

00:18:48.712 --> 00:18:50.630 position:50% align:center
I'm a knight.

00:18:50.714 --> 00:18:53.717 position:50% align:center
[static crackles]

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.677 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA]
Status report?

00:18:56.636 --> 00:18:58.972 position:50% align:center
[5TH SOLDIER J] The Angels are
fighting Hinawa and Maki.

00:18:59.055 --> 00:19:00.932 position:50% align:center
Arthur's up against
the Infernal.

00:19:01.016 --> 00:19:04.060 position:50% align:center
No one's seen Obi yet,
but he should be near.

00:19:04.144 --> 00:19:07.355 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA] Moths do love
their flames, don't they?

00:19:07.439 --> 00:19:10.316 position:50% align:center
Burn the lot of them and
leave no trace behind.

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:14.362 position:50% align:center
The truth, the intrigue
behind spontaneous combustion,

00:19:14.446 --> 00:19:16.656 position:50% align:center
it was found through
our research.

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:19.826 position:50% align:center
I won't let gravel
steal it from us.

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:24.080 position:50% align:center
Are you sure you're
a Fire Soldier?

00:19:24.164 --> 00:19:26.583 position:50% align:center
'Cause you're not putting up
much of a fight right now.

00:19:26.666 --> 00:19:28.960 position:50% align:center
What's wrong,
ya scared or somethin'?

00:19:29.044 --> 00:19:30.045 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:19:33.798 --> 00:19:36.593 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMOTO] I can see through
your act, tough guy.

00:19:37.969 --> 00:19:40.221 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:19:44.351 --> 00:19:45.977 position:50% align:center
You put on a cute show.

00:19:46.061 --> 00:19:49.230 position:50% align:center
But beneath that false
confidence, you're crazy weak.

00:19:49.314 --> 00:19:50.607 position:50% align:center
And stupid, too.

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:52.692 position:50% align:center
Damn. What's going on?

00:19:52.776 --> 00:19:55.028 position:50% align:center
Why do I feel so
out of form today?

00:19:55.111 --> 00:19:58.031 position:50% align:center
[CONEHEAD] It isn't a question
of whether you're "in form."

00:19:58.114 --> 00:20:01.951 position:50% align:center
My Infernal's firepower is
simply too much for you.

00:20:02.035 --> 00:20:03.453 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMOTO]
Of course a punk like you

00:20:03.536 --> 00:20:06.039 position:50% align:center
would blame your weakness
on somethin' or another.

00:20:06.122 --> 00:20:07.624 position:50% align:center
You're not havin' a bad day--

00:20:07.707 --> 00:20:10.627 position:50% align:center
you were never any
good to begin with!

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:14.381 position:50% align:center
You've made exactly the kind
of excuse I'd expect to hear

00:20:14.464 --> 00:20:16.633 position:50% align:center
from a dumb phony like you!

00:20:16.716 --> 00:20:17.509 position:50% align:center
Say what?

00:20:17.592 --> 00:20:19.052 position:50% align:center
[CONEHEAD chuckles]

00:20:19.135 --> 00:20:21.096 position:50% align:center
[CONEHEAD] It would seem
that this tenderfoot rookie

00:20:21.179 --> 00:20:23.473 position:50% align:center
isn't even competent
enough to understand

00:20:23.556 --> 00:20:26.309 position:50% align:center
how terribly outmatched he is.

00:20:26.393 --> 00:20:29.270 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMOTO] And to hear him
blame it on his form is sad.

00:20:29.354 --> 00:20:31.981 position:50% align:center
You can call yourself a
knight all you want, chump.

00:20:32.065 --> 00:20:36.194 position:50% align:center
Fact is, you're just an idiot
who's all bark and no bite.

00:20:36.277 --> 00:20:39.864 position:50% align:center
In truth, I'm more than a
knight. I'm a Knight King!

00:20:45.495 --> 00:20:48.373 position:50% align:center
You tried to stick your nose
where it doesn't belong.

00:20:48.456 --> 00:20:52.168 position:50% align:center
And now I'm about to reward you
with a quick, painful death!

00:20:52.252 --> 00:20:53.962 position:50% align:center
Why? I don't get it.

00:20:54.045 --> 00:20:56.589 position:50% align:center
My power's failed me completely.

00:20:58.258 --> 00:20:59.509 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:00.844 --> 00:21:03.680 position:50% align:center
Wait a sec. I'm definitely
right-handed.

00:21:03.763 --> 00:21:06.141 position:50% align:center
Why's Excalibur in my left hand?

00:21:06.224 --> 00:21:08.268 position:50% align:center
[MIYAMOTO]
Huh?! How should I know?

00:21:08.351 --> 00:21:11.938 position:50% align:center
You can ask whatever you find
waiting in the afterlife!

00:21:24.743 --> 00:21:27.037 position:50% align:center
That was my Violet Flash.

00:21:35.295 --> 00:21:38.882 position:50% align:center
That's better. I thought
I felt something strange.

00:21:38.965 --> 00:21:41.134 position:50% align:center
What did I just witness?

00:21:41.217 --> 00:21:43.845 position:50% align:center
He's absurdly strong!

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:46.848 position:50% align:center
5th Angels Three!
Three-on-Three!

00:21:46.931 --> 00:21:49.517 position:50% align:center
Triple Grating Slasher
Version 2.3!

00:21:49.601 --> 00:21:50.685 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:21:52.604 --> 00:21:54.397 position:50% align:center
[MAKI]
That's way too many...

00:21:54.481 --> 00:21:55.815 position:50% align:center
...threes!

00:21:58.568 --> 00:21:59.861 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA] For some reason,
I thought there were

00:21:59.944 --> 00:22:02.822 position:50% align:center
just three 5th Angels Three...

00:22:02.906 --> 00:22:04.282 position:50% align:center
...but it looks like
we got all of them.

00:22:04.366 --> 00:22:06.826 position:50% align:center
[ANGEL C whimpering]

00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:08.203 position:50% align:center
Well, good.

00:22:08.286 --> 00:22:11.414 position:50% align:center
I wonder how things are going
for Arthur and Shinra.

00:22:11.498 --> 00:22:13.917 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA] While the two of them
dash around spreading havoc,

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.419 position:50% align:center
we can track down
those documents.

00:22:25.178 --> 00:22:26.680 position:50% align:center
Here we go.
