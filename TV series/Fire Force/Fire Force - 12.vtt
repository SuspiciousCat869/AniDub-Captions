[OBI] Causes of death
are many and varied.

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:18.893 position:50% align:center
Old age. Illness. Suicide.

00:00:18.977 --> 00:00:20.687 position:50% align:center
But out of that long,
morbid list,

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.357 position:50% align:center
there's one end that people
fear above all others...

00:00:27.277 --> 00:00:29.279 position:50% align:center line:10%
[OBI]
Death by fire.

Kagiya!

00:00:51.176 --> 00:00:53.136 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
It really is a festival.

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.348 position:50% align:center
This must be a way of mourning
that's unique to Asakusa.

00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:59.601 position:50% align:center
It's different from most
proto-nationalist funerals.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.314 position:50% align:center
Let's get these
repairs started quickly.

00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:05.732 position:50% align:center
[7TH CREWMEN]
Right!

00:01:05.815 --> 00:01:07.567 position:50% align:center
If I destroyed your house
during Kantaro's send-off,

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.028 position:50% align:center
you're welcome to stay
at the guardhouse.

00:01:10.111 --> 00:01:12.030 position:50% align:center
We'll look after you
until it's been fixed.

00:01:12.113 --> 00:01:14.407 position:50% align:center
I don't think it'll
take too long.

00:01:15.825 --> 00:01:18.161 position:50% align:center
Hey, Captain, would it
be all right with you

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:20.288 position:50% align:center
if I helped out with
repairs as well?

00:01:20.372 --> 00:01:21.790 position:50% align:center
Good idea.

00:01:21.873 --> 00:01:24.167 position:50% align:center
Doubt they'll talk to us while
they're dealing with this,

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.170 position:50% align:center
so we may as well help
speed things along.

00:01:41.726 --> 00:01:43.269 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU]
Huh? Hey!

00:01:43.353 --> 00:01:45.021 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Please let the 8th help!

00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:46.356 position:50% align:center
Thanks to my powers,

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.317 position:50% align:center
I can carry heavy loads
to high places no problem.

00:01:55.699 --> 00:01:58.660 position:50% align:center
Let me get all this wreckage
outta the way for you.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.166 position:50% align:center
You can leave the
welding work to me.

00:02:09.004 --> 00:02:10.380 position:50% align:center
[7TH CREWMAN A]
Huh. Not bad.

00:02:10.463 --> 00:02:11.756 position:50% align:center
Whoa.

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:17.470 position:50% align:center
[7TH CREWMEN gasp]

00:02:17.554 --> 00:02:20.724 position:50% align:center
Think we'll have to get a
truck over here to move this.

[7TH CREWMEN yelling]

[MAN]
I saw Company 8's Matchbox

00:02:56.801 --> 00:02:59.512 position:50% align:center
parked on Yagen
Street in Asakusa.

00:02:59.596 --> 00:03:03.808 position:50% align:center
Why would the 8th be in
the 7th's jurisdiction?

00:03:03.892 --> 00:03:04.976 position:50% align:center
[ARROW]
When the 8th moved

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.978 position:50% align:center
to investigate Company
1's jurisdiction,

00:03:07.062 --> 00:03:08.438 position:50% align:center
it was because of Rekka.

00:03:08.521 --> 00:03:10.690 position:50% align:center
They may have caught
our scent here.

00:03:10.774 --> 00:03:13.943 position:50% align:center
What does the
Evangelist command?

00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:15.570 position:50% align:center
[ARROW]
We failed to kill them before,

00:03:15.653 --> 00:03:18.239 position:50% align:center
so we're to finish the job now.

00:03:19.491 --> 00:03:22.577 position:50% align:center
[ARROW] Prepare the traps.
The bugs, too.

00:04:59.507 --> 00:05:02.135 position:50% align:center
[7TH CREWMAN D]
Today's work is done!

00:05:02.218 --> 00:05:04.346 position:50% align:center
[7TH CREWMAN E]
Call it a day and rest up!

00:05:08.391 --> 00:05:11.227 position:50% align:center
You honestly don't
have to do this, Waka.

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:13.021 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU] I do, the youngsters
have been out there

00:05:13.104 --> 00:05:14.606 position:50% align:center
working their butts
off rebuilding,

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:16.775 position:50% align:center
so this is the least I can do.

00:05:16.858 --> 00:05:18.610 position:50% align:center
Well, thank you.

00:05:18.693 --> 00:05:19.986 position:50% align:center
[KONRO gasps]

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:21.363 position:50% align:center
Does that hurt?

00:05:21.446 --> 00:05:24.616 position:50% align:center
I'm fine. The cold
just surprised me.

00:05:25.658 --> 00:05:29.537 position:50% align:center
You know, Konro, honestly,
I still think you're the one

00:05:29.621 --> 00:05:31.664 position:50% align:center
who should've become captain.

00:05:31.748 --> 00:05:35.794 position:50% align:center
Well, I don't. Company 7
is a bunch of rowdy thugs.

00:05:35.877 --> 00:05:37.462 position:50% align:center
I can't fight anymore,

00:05:37.545 --> 00:05:40.507 position:50% align:center
which means I'd never
make it as their captain.

00:05:42.175 --> 00:05:43.510 position:50% align:center

Hey, hold on!

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.182 position:50% align:center
Hello, girls. How goes it?

00:05:49.265 --> 00:05:51.309 position:50% align:center
That damn twerp keeps
chasin' us around.

00:05:51.393 --> 00:05:52.686 position:50% align:center
I think he's try'na eat us.

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:54.646 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it's pretty
friggin' screwed up.

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:56.564 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] I was nice enough
to play tag with you

00:05:56.648 --> 00:05:58.608 position:50% align:center
and this is my reward?

00:05:58.692 --> 00:06:01.361 position:50% align:center
Didn't you like seeing
my spinning fire top?

00:06:01.444 --> 00:06:03.113 position:50% align:center
Spinning fire top?

00:06:03.196 --> 00:06:04.572 position:50% align:center
He shoots fire out of his feet,

00:06:04.656 --> 00:06:06.366 position:50% align:center
and then he spins
around on his head!

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:07.701 position:50% align:center
It's really stupid.

00:06:07.784 --> 00:06:09.619 position:50% align:center
[HINATA, HIKAGE]
Yay! Ha-ha!

00:06:09.703 --> 00:06:12.664 position:50% align:center
It's a cool dance move
called break-dancing.

00:06:12.747 --> 00:06:15.041 position:50% align:center
It's not stupid, it's
difficult and awesome.

00:06:15.125 --> 00:06:18.211 position:50% align:center
Heh. Such a kid.

00:06:18.294 --> 00:06:20.505 position:50% align:center
Thanks for the help.
I appreciate it.

00:06:20.588 --> 00:06:23.466 position:50% align:center
I know what a handful these
runts can be, and you...

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.052 position:50% align:center
Call us runts again and
we'll smoosh you, Konro!

00:06:26.136 --> 00:06:28.430 position:50% align:center
No sweat. I'm pretty good at
keeping children entertained.

00:06:28.513 --> 00:06:29.431 position:50% align:center
[HINATA]
Treat us like kids again

00:06:29.514 --> 00:06:31.433 position:50% align:center

00:06:34.728 --> 00:06:37.522 position:50% align:center
Come on. I'll show you one
more spinning fire top.

00:06:37.605 --> 00:06:41.317 position:50% align:center
[HIKAGE] Shut up! Don't tell
us what to do, you punk!

[HIKAGE yelps]

00:06:45.739 --> 00:06:47.657 position:50% align:center
These Company 8 people,

00:06:47.741 --> 00:06:50.118 position:50% align:center
they aren't a bad
bunch to be around.

00:06:50.201 --> 00:06:51.619 position:50% align:center
I feel like they're
a different sort

00:06:51.703 --> 00:06:53.663 position:50% align:center
than the other companies.

00:06:53.747 --> 00:06:56.833 position:50% align:center
They remind me of us in a way.

00:06:56.916 --> 00:06:59.377 position:50% align:center
I suppose so.

00:06:59.461 --> 00:07:02.047 position:50% align:center
[KONRO] Why don't we help
with their investigation?

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.052 position:50% align:center
So is that what you would
do if you were our captain?

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:13.058 position:50% align:center
Waka, you weren't chosen
to be this company's captain

00:07:13.141 --> 00:07:15.268 position:50% align:center
just because of your power.

00:07:15.352 --> 00:07:18.438 position:50% align:center
Do you know why Company 8
chose to help us today? 'Cause--

00:07:18.521 --> 00:07:22.025 position:50% align:center
Just give it a rest. I've heard
you say all this before.

00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:25.362 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but I'm not cut
out for this crap.

00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:28.114 position:50% align:center
I never should have
been made a leader.

00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:32.911 position:50% align:center
Face forward, will ya, Konro?

00:07:32.994 --> 00:07:36.039 position:50% align:center
I can't wrap your
bandage like this.

00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:37.707 position:50% align:center
Think we will help 'em.

00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:40.919 position:50% align:center
Company 8 is pretty
all right in my book.

00:07:48.176 --> 00:07:50.428 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Ah! Waka!

00:07:50.512 --> 00:07:52.222 position:50% align:center
Sorry about the intrusion, sir.

00:07:52.305 --> 00:07:55.225 position:50% align:center
That? There's no
need to sweat it.

00:07:56.685 --> 00:08:00.980 position:50% align:center
So, hey, about
Lieutenant Konro's body.

00:08:01.064 --> 00:08:02.899 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU] When a third-
generation continues

00:08:02.982 --> 00:08:05.360 position:50% align:center
to use their powers
after overheating,

00:08:05.443 --> 00:08:10.490 position:50% align:center
their body starts to incinerate,
and their flesh becomes ash.

Tephrosis. This the first
you've heard of it?

00:08:14.911 --> 00:08:16.913 position:50% align:center
They taught us about
it at the Academy.

00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:19.833 position:50% align:center
Never saw it though.
Not in person.

00:08:19.916 --> 00:08:22.043 position:50% align:center
When it happened, I...

00:08:26.256 --> 00:08:28.508 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU]
Shinra, I'd like to have

00:08:28.591 --> 00:08:30.552 position:50% align:center
a few words with your captain.

00:08:30.635 --> 00:08:31.720 position:50% align:center
Is he around?

00:08:31.803 --> 00:08:34.347 position:50% align:center
Oh. Right. That's actually
why I came here.

00:08:34.431 --> 00:08:36.516 position:50% align:center
Captain Obi sent me to
ask if you'd meet him.

00:08:36.599 --> 00:08:40.186 position:50% align:center
He's across the way, over in
that back alley by the river.

00:08:41.354 --> 00:08:44.107 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Yay!

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:47.027 position:50% align:center
What're you gonna do now?
The 8th stayin' in town?

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:48.361 position:50% align:center
As long as you're around,

00:08:48.445 --> 00:08:49.696 position:50% align:center
you could always stay with
us here at the station.

00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:51.656 position:50% align:center
It's not something
we were planning on,

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:53.825 position:50% align:center
but since we helped
with all those repairs,

00:08:53.908 --> 00:08:56.953 position:50% align:center
our relationship with Company 7
has improved quite a bit.

00:08:57.037 --> 00:08:59.664 position:50% align:center
Quick question, Missy.
You wanna strip for us again?

00:08:59.748 --> 00:09:01.708 position:50% align:center
That's not gonna happen!

00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:05.628 position:50% align:center
Hopefully, they'll allow us
to start our investigation now.

00:09:05.712 --> 00:09:06.880 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah.

00:09:06.963 --> 00:09:08.757 position:50% align:center
I was just with Captain
Shinmon, and last I saw,

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.925 position:50% align:center
he was heading off
to meet with Obi.

00:09:11.009 --> 00:09:13.136 position:50% align:center
Think they'll end up
working something out.

00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:15.638 position:50% align:center
We haven't found anything
but breadcrumbs yet.

00:09:15.722 --> 00:09:18.224 position:50% align:center
But we're on the
White-Clads' trail.

00:09:24.272 --> 00:09:25.315 position:50% align:center
I know we had to leave her

00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:27.233 position:50% align:center
'cause of all the
proto-nationalists,

00:09:27.317 --> 00:09:29.652 position:50% align:center
but I feel weird
without Iris around.

00:09:29.736 --> 00:09:31.988 position:50% align:center
And I'm glad the 5th's
holding things down for us,

00:09:32.072 --> 00:09:34.949 position:50% align:center
but we need to start
this investigation ASAP.

00:09:35.033 --> 00:09:38.536 position:50% align:center
The sooner we can get this
mess figured out, the better.

00:09:39.746 --> 00:09:41.247 position:50% align:center
Hurry up and get
rid of all this.

00:09:41.331 --> 00:09:43.625 position:50% align:center
We need to clear more space
for Shinra's new desk.

00:09:43.708 --> 00:09:45.585 position:50% align:center
You can toss Obi's junk outside.

00:09:45.669 --> 00:09:48.254 position:50% align:center
Uh. Hey, could you not?

00:09:48.338 --> 00:09:51.466 position:50% align:center
Apologies, Captain,
but why are we doing all this?

00:09:51.549 --> 00:09:52.342 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA]
They need to learn

00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:54.552 position:50% align:center
not to boss Company 5 around.

00:09:54.636 --> 00:09:57.263 position:50% align:center
Shouldn't you have just
told them "no" then?

00:09:58.348 --> 00:10:00.392 position:50% align:center
<i>Látom.</i>

00:10:00.475 --> 00:10:03.061 position:50% align:center
Where does a worthless,
lowly piece of gravel like you

00:10:03.144 --> 00:10:04.521 position:50% align:center
get off telling me
what I should do?

00:10:04.604 --> 00:10:06.398 position:50% align:center
Yes, I'm nothing
but a lump of gravel.

00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:07.857 position:50% align:center
Punish me till you're satisfied!

00:10:07.941 --> 00:10:12.237 position:50% align:center
Owie! Owie! Oh!
Stomp even harder, please!

00:10:17.534 --> 00:10:19.119 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
That went well, don't you think?

00:10:19.202 --> 00:10:19.828 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU]
Hm?

00:10:19.911 --> 00:10:21.037 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA]
Yes, it did.

00:10:21.121 --> 00:10:23.081 position:50% align:center
[OBI] We turned that
Kantaro guy Infernal,

00:10:23.164 --> 00:10:24.541 position:50% align:center
and they're none the wiser.

00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:26.042 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA]
That's true.

00:10:26.126 --> 00:10:27.419 position:50% align:center
Let's turn as many
of these people

00:10:27.502 --> 00:10:29.295 position:50% align:center
as we can into Infernals.

00:10:29.379 --> 00:10:30.588 position:50% align:center
Agreed.

00:10:33.258 --> 00:10:34.467 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:34.551 --> 00:10:35.593 position:50% align:center
[7TH CREWMAN H]
A fire!

00:10:35.677 --> 00:10:36.469 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Maki!

00:10:36.553 --> 00:10:38.096 position:50% align:center
We need to assess the situation.

00:10:38.179 --> 00:10:39.889 position:50% align:center
Let's try to avoid
doing anything rash

00:10:39.973 --> 00:10:42.434 position:50% align:center
until we've met up
with Captain Obi.

00:10:44.019 --> 00:10:45.270 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
What's going on here?

00:10:45.353 --> 00:10:46.938 position:50% align:center
Why is he attacking us?

00:10:47.022 --> 00:10:50.567 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA] I told you not to
eat Company 7's <i>daifuku</i> !

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:54.320 position:50% align:center
[growls] I only had one of them,
though. He's overreacting!

00:10:57.657 --> 00:10:59.159 position:50% align:center
You're dead.

00:10:59.242 --> 00:11:00.869 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
What did we do?

00:11:00.952 --> 00:11:02.454 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU]
Shut up!

00:11:02.537 --> 00:11:04.289 position:50% align:center
No chance in hell are
you talking your way

00:11:04.372 --> 00:11:07.125 position:50% align:center
out of this one.

00:11:07.208 --> 00:11:10.545 position:50% align:center
You're the ones who turned
Kantaro into an Infernal.

00:11:10.628 --> 00:11:11.629 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Hm?

00:11:14.049 --> 00:11:16.384 position:50% align:center
[OBI] Wait a second,
you think that was us?

00:11:16.468 --> 00:11:19.554 position:50% align:center
Captain Shinmon, what
are you talking about?

00:11:19.637 --> 00:11:22.599 position:50% align:center
No point playing dumb.
I saw you and heard you.

00:11:22.682 --> 00:11:25.060 position:50% align:center
I know you plan to
bury my town in ash,

00:11:25.143 --> 00:11:27.103 position:50% align:center
but you screwed up big time.

00:11:27.187 --> 00:11:30.315 position:50% align:center
Because now that I know,
you've got no chance!

00:11:33.318 --> 00:11:34.527 position:50% align:center
I don't know what you saw, sir,

00:11:34.611 --> 00:11:36.446 position:50% align:center
but please calm down
so we can talk.

00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:38.782 position:50% align:center
Screw that. There's
nothing to say.

00:11:38.865 --> 00:11:42.452 position:50% align:center
Your Evangelist is made up.
My real enemy's here.

00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:44.204 position:50% align:center
I saw your captain
and lieutenant

00:11:44.287 --> 00:11:47.082 position:50% align:center
plotting to turn the people
of this town into Infernals.

00:11:47.165 --> 00:11:49.000 position:50% align:center
And I will make them pay!

00:11:49.084 --> 00:11:50.585 position:50% align:center
You're making a mistake!

00:11:50.669 --> 00:11:54.964 position:50% align:center
I'll beat all of you to a pulp,
and then hang you out to dry.

00:11:55.048 --> 00:11:59.427 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU] I know exactly what
I saw. It was definitely them.

00:11:59.511 --> 00:12:02.764 position:50% align:center
Captain, doesn't sound
like he's messing around.

00:12:02.847 --> 00:12:03.932 position:50% align:center
Wait a minute, please!

00:12:04.015 --> 00:12:06.393 position:50% align:center
We didn't come out here
to start a fight.

00:12:06.476 --> 00:12:08.520 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU] If that's the
story you're sticking to,

00:12:08.603 --> 00:12:10.605 position:50% align:center
then beat me and
prove you're innocent.

00:12:10.689 --> 00:12:13.108 position:50% align:center
Might makes right around here!

00:12:13.191 --> 00:12:15.068 position:50% align:center
If you didn't wanna
start this fight,

00:12:15.151 --> 00:12:17.654 position:50% align:center
then prove your point
by ending it.

00:12:18.655 --> 00:12:20.782 position:50% align:center
You'd best get ready, Company 8.

00:12:20.865 --> 00:12:24.035 position:50% align:center
You're about to face
Shinmon Benimaru.

00:12:24.119 --> 00:12:25.829 position:50% align:center
Looks like we managed
to provoke him.

00:12:25.912 --> 00:12:26.871 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:12:26.955 --> 00:12:29.374 position:50% align:center
Then let's move
forward as planned.

00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:34.587 position:50% align:center
Hinawa!

00:12:34.671 --> 00:12:36.297 position:50% align:center
Leave it to me, sir.

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.928 position:50% align:center
Waka! The musclebound
idiot's running away!

00:12:43.263 --> 00:12:45.598 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU] Hiding behind
women and children now?

00:12:45.682 --> 00:12:48.143 position:50% align:center
Guess he's a murderer
and a coward!

00:12:48.226 --> 00:12:49.936 position:50% align:center
Everyone, stay back!

00:12:51.354 --> 00:12:53.314 position:50% align:center
I'm a Fire Soldier
just like you.

00:12:53.398 --> 00:12:55.233 position:50% align:center
Don't look down on me.

00:12:55.316 --> 00:12:57.068 position:50% align:center
Ya think you blocked that?

00:12:59.362 --> 00:13:00.822 position:50% align:center
Maki!

00:13:07.454 --> 00:13:08.663 position:50% align:center
[MAKI screams]

00:13:10.749 --> 00:13:12.167 position:50% align:center
[gunshots]

00:13:14.586 --> 00:13:16.421 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU] Fire that
peashooter all you want,

00:13:16.504 --> 00:13:17.630 position:50% align:center
you'll never hit me.

00:13:17.714 --> 00:13:19.591 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA] I wasn't
really expecting to.

00:13:19.674 --> 00:13:23.386 position:50% align:center
That said, I'd like to see what
limits your strength might have.

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:27.140 position:50% align:center
Can you wield your second- and
third-gen powers in tandem?

00:13:27.223 --> 00:13:29.267 position:50% align:center
Let's find out! Get him!

00:13:38.193 --> 00:13:40.445 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI yells]

00:13:43.323 --> 00:13:44.366 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR yells]

00:13:52.749 --> 00:13:56.753 position:50% align:center
You guys are finished.
Iai Chop, Form One...

00:13:56.836 --> 00:13:58.213 position:50% align:center
...Fire Moon.

00:14:08.682 --> 00:14:11.434 position:50% align:center
Is that the best
your company's got?

00:14:13.687 --> 00:14:14.479 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:14:14.562 --> 00:14:18.566 position:50% align:center
[footsteps]

00:14:19.943 --> 00:14:21.444 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU]
Hm?

00:14:21.528 --> 00:14:24.739 position:50% align:center
When you go after my
soldiers, you answer to me.

00:14:24.823 --> 00:14:26.783 position:50% align:center
He was just suiting up?

00:14:27.826 --> 00:14:31.162 position:50% align:center
[OBI] Let's settle this--
captain to captain.

00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:48.179 position:50% align:center
Why the hell would you turn an
innocent man into an Infernal?

00:14:48.263 --> 00:14:50.682 position:50% align:center
[OBI] You won't listen
to a word I have to say.

00:14:50.765 --> 00:14:53.601 position:50% align:center
So you may as well
shut up and bring it on!

00:14:53.685 --> 00:14:57.230 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU] You finally ready
to drop the act, you scum?

00:15:02.318 --> 00:15:03.236 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU]
Hm?

00:15:03.319 --> 00:15:04.863 position:50% align:center
You're not putting
out my flames.

00:15:04.946 --> 00:15:06.156 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Put them out?

00:15:06.239 --> 00:15:08.950 position:50% align:center
I'd love to if that
were possible...

00:15:09.034 --> 00:15:11.494 position:50% align:center
...but I don't have any powers.

00:15:11.578 --> 00:15:13.038 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU]
You're kidding.

00:15:16.875 --> 00:15:19.002 position:50% align:center
Then shouldn't you be
afraid of all this fire?

00:15:19.085 --> 00:15:22.130 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Damn right I am. It burns!

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.721 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU] If you know how
terrifying flames can be,

00:15:29.804 --> 00:15:31.014 position:50% align:center
then how could you
bring yourself

00:15:31.097 --> 00:15:33.391 position:50% align:center
to turn Kantaro infernal?

00:15:34.392 --> 00:15:38.188 position:50% align:center
[OBI] I'm telling you, there's
been some kind of mistake!

00:15:38.271 --> 00:15:40.065 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU]
There was no mistake.

00:15:40.148 --> 00:15:42.484 position:50% align:center
I know what I saw!

00:15:42.567 --> 00:15:44.027 position:50% align:center
Captain, no!

00:15:47.322 --> 00:15:51.284 position:50% align:center
[OBI] I don't care if you're
second gen, third gen, or both.

00:15:51.368 --> 00:15:55.205 position:50% align:center
I train every single day.

00:15:55.288 --> 00:15:57.248 position:50% align:center
An extinguisher grenade?

00:16:12.597 --> 00:16:13.682 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:17.602 --> 00:16:19.938 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU]
You gassed yourself, too?

00:16:32.117 --> 00:16:34.619 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
And let that be a lesson to ya.

00:16:34.703 --> 00:16:37.622 position:50% align:center
It's almost like you
don't know how to flinch.

00:16:38.665 --> 00:16:41.793 position:50% align:center
I can't afford to
flinch right now.

00:16:41.876 --> 00:16:44.129 position:50% align:center
Not when I'm carrying
the weight of Company 8

00:16:44.212 --> 00:16:46.089 position:50% align:center
on my shoulders.

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:49.092 position:50% align:center
What's the deal with
that muscle guy?

00:16:49.175 --> 00:16:50.468 position:50% align:center
He doesn't have powers.

00:16:50.552 --> 00:16:52.470 position:50% align:center
Then how did he
manage to hit Waka?

00:16:52.554 --> 00:16:55.765 position:50% align:center
How did he do that? The
captain's really that strong?

00:16:55.849 --> 00:16:58.601 position:50% align:center
Did you think he was a pushover?

00:16:58.685 --> 00:17:02.689 position:50% align:center
That said, strong or not,
he shouldn't act so recklessly.

00:17:03.648 --> 00:17:06.693 position:50% align:center
Captains Obi and Shinmon are
both charismatic figures.

00:17:06.776 --> 00:17:09.446 position:50% align:center
Whatever paths they take,
others will follow.

00:17:09.529 --> 00:17:12.657 position:50% align:center
We can't allow this fight
to continue for much longer.

00:17:12.741 --> 00:17:14.743 position:50% align:center
Is there a way we
can make them stop?

00:17:14.826 --> 00:17:16.870 position:50% align:center
It seems as though beating
him is the only way

00:17:16.953 --> 00:17:18.288 position:50% align:center
to set the record straight.

00:17:18.371 --> 00:17:19.247 position:50% align:center
Waka!

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:21.583 position:50% align:center
Let him have it!

00:17:21.666 --> 00:17:23.752 position:50% align:center
What's all this
commotion about?

00:17:23.835 --> 00:17:25.587 position:50% align:center
Apparently these 8th
people are the ones

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:27.380 position:50% align:center
who turned Kantaro infernal.

00:17:27.464 --> 00:17:29.382 position:50% align:center
Waka snapped and
started a fight!

00:17:29.466 --> 00:17:31.134 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Munch!

00:17:31.217 --> 00:17:34.763 position:50% align:center
That can't be right.
It's too absurd.

00:17:36.973 --> 00:17:38.975 position:50% align:center
None of these things
you do add up.

00:17:39.059 --> 00:17:41.311 position:50% align:center
When'll you start making sense?

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:47.359 position:50% align:center
So you won't go down to anything
less than my best stuff.

00:17:47.442 --> 00:17:48.360 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:17:48.443 --> 00:17:50.904 position:50% align:center
Guess I'll stop playing then.

00:17:52.906 --> 00:17:53.948 position:50% align:center
What is he doing now?

00:17:54.032 --> 00:17:55.283 position:50% align:center
[KONRO]
No!

00:17:56.826 --> 00:18:01.664 position:50% align:center
Here goes. Iai Chop,
Form Seven: Sun Wheel.

00:18:01.748 --> 00:18:03.166 position:50% align:center
Waka, hold on!

00:18:03.249 --> 00:18:05.168 position:50% align:center
Don't try to stop me.

00:18:05.251 --> 00:18:07.003 position:50% align:center
These people aren't
what they seem.

00:18:07.087 --> 00:18:08.546 position:50% align:center
They turned Kantaro infernal

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:11.216 position:50% align:center
and they wanna do the same with
everyone else in this town.

00:18:11.299 --> 00:18:12.884 position:50% align:center
What makes you think that?

00:18:12.967 --> 00:18:14.594 position:50% align:center
I saw this one
and his lieutenant

00:18:14.678 --> 00:18:16.179 position:50% align:center
plotting the whole thing out.

00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:20.141 position:50% align:center
How many times do I have to tell
you that you've made a mistake?!

00:18:20.225 --> 00:18:21.851 position:50% align:center
Enough talk.

00:18:23.645 --> 00:18:24.854 position:50% align:center
Let me do this, Konro.

00:18:24.938 --> 00:18:27.357 position:50% align:center
No. You need to calm down.

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:28.441 position:50% align:center
What's the matter with you?

00:18:28.525 --> 00:18:31.277 position:50% align:center
Why are you using
your pyrokinesis?

00:18:31.361 --> 00:18:33.279 position:50% align:center
[KONRO groaning]

00:18:33.363 --> 00:18:35.990 position:50% align:center
Hinata! Hikage! Bring
me a cooling blanket!

00:18:36.074 --> 00:18:36.741 position:50% align:center
Can do!

00:18:36.825 --> 00:18:38.702 position:50% align:center
We're on the job!

00:18:38.785 --> 00:18:40.829 position:50% align:center
Waka, as a favor to me,

00:18:40.912 --> 00:18:43.915 position:50% align:center
would you at least hear out
what they have to say?

00:18:45.542 --> 00:18:47.002 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:54.968 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:18:55.051 --> 00:18:58.179 position:50% align:center
When Waka thinks he saw you,
where were you two actually?

00:18:58.263 --> 00:19:00.140 position:50% align:center
The captain and I
were both at the store

00:19:00.223 --> 00:19:03.601 position:50% align:center
stocking up on a few essential
supplies that we'd run short on.

00:19:03.685 --> 00:19:06.021 position:50% align:center
We informed Fire Soldier
Maki before we left.

00:19:06.104 --> 00:19:07.522 position:50% align:center
Yeah. They told me.

00:19:07.605 --> 00:19:10.775 position:50% align:center
Hold on. He didn't mention
anything about the store to me.

00:19:10.859 --> 00:19:12.652 position:50% align:center
He told me to go and
ask Captain Shinmon

00:19:12.736 --> 00:19:14.821 position:50% align:center
to meet him and the
lieutenant in that alley.

00:19:14.904 --> 00:19:16.573 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU]
That's right you did.

00:19:16.656 --> 00:19:18.700 position:50% align:center
I agreed and then
headed Obi's way.

00:19:18.783 --> 00:19:21.369 position:50% align:center
Only I don't remember
ever saying that.

00:19:21.453 --> 00:19:24.622 position:50% align:center
The hell is this?
Tryin' to fool him, too?

00:19:24.706 --> 00:19:27.375 position:50% align:center
I'll ask the store
clerk to confirm this.

00:19:30.462 --> 00:19:31.755 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU]
For Konro's sake,

00:19:31.838 --> 00:19:33.465 position:50% align:center
I'm delaying your judgment.

00:19:33.548 --> 00:19:35.091 position:50% align:center
Try to leave before
I say you can

00:19:35.175 --> 00:19:37.135 position:50% align:center
and there will be violence.

00:19:42.057 --> 00:19:43.725 position:50% align:center
Sorry about him.

00:19:43.808 --> 00:19:46.478 position:50% align:center
Waka's always been
a stubborn one.

00:19:46.561 --> 00:19:49.356 position:50% align:center
That's just as true now
as it's ever been.

00:19:52.067 --> 00:19:54.652 position:50% align:center
Lieutenant Konro, not to pry,

00:19:54.736 --> 00:19:57.655 position:50% align:center
but how did you
end up like this?

00:19:58.782 --> 00:20:02.410 position:50% align:center
Bottom line, I wasn't
strong enough.

00:20:03.578 --> 00:20:05.330 position:50% align:center
Was Captain Shinmon with you?

00:20:05.413 --> 00:20:08.708 position:50% align:center
He seemed to have
regrets about it.

00:20:08.792 --> 00:20:10.877 position:50% align:center
[KONRO]
None of this was his fault.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:13.546 position:50% align:center
Waka didn't do anything wrong.

00:20:16.299 --> 00:20:18.677 position:50% align:center
[KONRO]
I'll just tell you.

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:20.428 position:50% align:center
This was a while back,

00:20:20.512 --> 00:20:23.765 position:50% align:center
before we were recognized
as a Fire Force company.

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:32.941 position:50% align:center
--[PEOPLE screaming]
--[bell clanging]

00:20:33.024 --> 00:20:35.318 position:50% align:center
[7TH CREWMAN I]
Everyone run to the river!

00:20:41.741 --> 00:20:43.076 position:50% align:center
What the hell's going on?

00:20:43.159 --> 00:20:44.828 position:50% align:center
How can this many
people have turned?

00:20:44.911 --> 00:20:47.038 position:50% align:center
Why're they all going
Infernal tonight?

00:20:47.122 --> 00:20:48.373 position:50% align:center
I'm as confused as you are.

00:20:48.456 --> 00:20:51.751 position:50% align:center
Let's just focus on
evacuation for now.

00:20:51.835 --> 00:20:53.378 position:50% align:center
Where's the Fire Force?

00:20:53.461 --> 00:20:55.880 position:50% align:center
Don't you think they should've
gotten here a while ago?

00:20:55.964 --> 00:21:00.260 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but we can't rely on them.
We'll do this ourselves.

00:21:00.343 --> 00:21:02.387 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU groaning]

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:03.471 position:50% align:center
[KONRO]
Beni!

00:21:03.555 --> 00:21:06.766 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU]
Damn it. I can't breathe.

00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:10.603 position:50% align:center
Hard as I try, I just can't
seem to get any oxygen in.

00:21:10.687 --> 00:21:12.355 position:50% align:center
[KONRO] You're at your
pyrokinetic limit.

00:21:12.439 --> 00:21:14.816 position:50% align:center
Stay here. I'll be back.

00:21:14.899 --> 00:21:16.067 position:50% align:center
Not a chance, dumbass.

00:21:16.151 --> 00:21:18.611 position:50% align:center
We both know you're in
the same boat as me.

00:21:20.655 --> 00:21:21.865 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU]
What?

00:21:31.791 --> 00:21:33.626 position:50% align:center
[KONRO]
What is that thing?

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:37.380 position:50% align:center
[KONRO]
A demon!

00:21:38.798 --> 00:21:42.010 position:50% align:center
[DEMON INFERNAL roars]

00:21:44.471 --> 00:21:48.183 position:50% align:center
[KONRO] That Infernal...
it isn't like the others.

00:21:49.684 --> 00:21:50.935 position:50% align:center
[KONRO]
Damn it.

00:21:52.187 --> 00:21:54.230 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU]
What are you doing?

00:21:54.314 --> 00:21:55.857 position:50% align:center
Konro!

00:21:58.318 --> 00:21:59.486 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry,

00:21:59.569 --> 00:22:01.905 position:50% align:center
but with a rambunctious
little brat like you,

00:22:01.988 --> 00:22:04.991 position:50% align:center
there was no other way
to get you to sit still.

00:22:06.576 --> 00:22:08.536 position:50% align:center
[KONRO]
It's too soon, Beni.

00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:11.498 position:50% align:center
I can't let your
fire go out yet.

00:22:20.298 --> 00:22:23.635 position:50% align:center
[KONRO]
Rest up. I'll deal with this.
