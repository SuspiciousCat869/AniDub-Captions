00:00:12.303 --> 00:00:14.764 position:50% align:center
[OBI] Causes of death
are many and varied.

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:18.226 position:50% align:center
Old age. Illness. Suicide.

00:00:18.309 --> 00:00:20.020 position:50% align:center
But out of that long,
morbid list,

00:00:20.103 --> 00:00:23.565 position:50% align:center
there's one end that people
fear above all others...

00:00:26.234 --> 00:00:28.236 position:50% align:center line:10%
[OBI]
Death by fire.

00:00:41.124 --> 00:00:44.544 position:50% align:center
[MAN] Yes. I'm performing
your works as instructed.

00:00:44.627 --> 00:00:47.047 position:50% align:center
There may be a few
minor obstacles,

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.840 position:50% align:center
but I'll overcome them.

00:00:48.923 --> 00:00:53.011 position:50% align:center
Infernalization will
continue unimpeded.

00:00:53.094 --> 00:00:56.806 position:50% align:center
Understood, Evangelist.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.433 position:50% align:center
<i>LÃ¡tom</i> .

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:08.818 position:50% align:center
[OBI] You compared the core
matter of two specimens,

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:10.612 position:50% align:center
Infernals A and B,

00:01:10.695 --> 00:01:13.114 position:50% align:center
and found a difference
in their compositions.

00:01:13.198 --> 00:01:14.324 position:50% align:center
Through chemical analysis,

00:01:14.407 --> 00:01:16.117 position:50% align:center
you discovered the
DNA of a creature

00:01:16.201 --> 00:01:19.788 position:50% align:center
that wasn't the victim
inside Infernal A's core.

00:01:19.871 --> 00:01:23.375 position:50% align:center
And you think that this
DNA belonged to a bug.

00:01:25.835 --> 00:01:27.253 position:50% align:center
I don't just think that,

00:01:27.337 --> 00:01:30.090 position:50% align:center
it's the conclusion I reached
through careful research.

00:01:30.173 --> 00:01:32.676 position:50% align:center
I've studied many other
Infernal cadavers,

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.303 position:50% align:center
and the specimens I suspected
of artificial ignition

00:01:35.387 --> 00:01:37.806 position:50% align:center
all had the same
things in common.

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:39.557 position:50% align:center
Their cores had
been compromised,

00:01:39.641 --> 00:01:40.892 position:50% align:center
pierced from without,

00:01:40.975 --> 00:01:44.020 position:50% align:center
as if a creature had
forcefully made its way in.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.691 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA]
An insect.

00:03:30.752 --> 00:03:33.922 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] It's been five days
since we joined the 1st.

00:03:34.005 --> 00:03:34.964 position:50% align:center
[chuckles, snorts]

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:36.049 position:50% align:center
[snoring]

00:03:36.132 --> 00:03:38.134 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
We'll be undercover for a month.

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:39.969 position:50% align:center
We have that long to
try and find a lead

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:43.139 position:50% align:center
on the source of these
artificial Infernals.

00:03:44.516 --> 00:03:45.350 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:03:45.433 --> 00:03:46.685 position:50% align:center
C'mon, Lieutenant Hinawa,

00:03:46.768 --> 00:03:48.436 position:50% align:center
what're you doing
here this time?

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.938 position:50% align:center
Checking up on you.

00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:53.066 position:50% align:center
Run into any problems yet?
Has Arthur been holding up okay?

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:55.026 position:50% align:center
I told you we were
doing fine yesterday,

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.821 position:50% align:center
do you have to come by
here every morning?

00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:00.240 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:04:00.323 --> 00:04:03.076 position:50% align:center
Goodness. If it isn't the
Lieutenant from the 8th.

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:05.245 position:50% align:center
Morning. Good to see you.

00:04:05.328 --> 00:04:06.705 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA]
Good morning.

00:04:06.788 --> 00:04:09.290 position:50% align:center
He has a lotta concern
for his soldiers, huh?

00:04:09.374 --> 00:04:10.667 position:50% align:center
[SISTER A]
Yeah, he really does.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.837 position:50% align:center
Sir, to be honest, this
is getting embarrassing.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.297 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA]
Hm? Don't really see why.

00:04:16.381 --> 00:04:17.465 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't need to come

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.385 position:50% align:center
if you checked in
with the captain more.

00:04:20.468 --> 00:04:22.637 position:50% align:center
Fine then, I'll do that.

00:04:23.805 --> 00:04:25.724 position:50% align:center
Shoo! Shoo!

00:04:27.434 --> 00:04:32.230 position:50% align:center
Oh, crap. Captain Hibana
came with him this time?

00:04:32.313 --> 00:04:34.899 position:50% align:center
The two of us are openly
prowling their grounds

00:04:34.983 --> 00:04:37.027 position:50% align:center
and they're completely
unperturbed.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.945 position:50% align:center
I can say for a fact
that we'd never be

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:40.447 position:50% align:center
this open at Company 5.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.950 position:50% align:center
We have too many of
Haijima's secrets to protect.

00:04:44.034 --> 00:04:45.493 position:50% align:center
According to my investigation,

00:04:45.577 --> 00:04:48.538 position:50% align:center
most artificial Infernals have
appeared at fire scenes,

00:04:48.621 --> 00:04:53.001 position:50% align:center
or in secured zones that only
Fire Soldiers can enter.

00:04:53.084 --> 00:04:55.086 position:50% align:center
Disturbing though it is,

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:59.382 position:50% align:center
it's likely that our culprit
is a Fire Soldier.

00:04:59.466 --> 00:05:03.345 position:50% align:center
The bigger question is whether
they're a member of Company 1.

00:05:10.185 --> 00:05:12.562 position:50% align:center
So, tell me,

00:05:12.645 --> 00:05:15.648 position:50% align:center
why'd you guys wanna become
Fire Soldiers, anyway?

00:05:15.732 --> 00:05:18.818 position:50% align:center
You know, as a hero, I thought
I should protect mankind

00:05:18.902 --> 00:05:21.071 position:50% align:center
from the Infernals and
human combustion.

00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:22.781 position:50% align:center
It's only natural
that a brave knight

00:05:22.864 --> 00:05:25.617 position:50% align:center
should fight on behalf
of the peasantry.

00:05:27.077 --> 00:05:29.454 position:50% align:center
Dude. This job is
a chick magnet.

00:05:29.537 --> 00:05:32.832 position:50% align:center
I joined 'cause I wanted
to impress the ladies.

00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:35.085 position:50% align:center
You guys are so amazing.

00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:38.254 position:50% align:center
I can barely control
my pyrokinesis at all.

00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:40.173 position:50% align:center
Maybe it's 'cause I don't
have a sense of purpose

00:05:40.256 --> 00:05:41.841 position:50% align:center
like you guys do.

00:05:41.925 --> 00:05:44.219 position:50% align:center
You don't need some
grand objective.

00:05:44.302 --> 00:05:45.970 position:50% align:center
As long as you end up
helping people out,

00:05:46.054 --> 00:05:47.472 position:50% align:center
I think you've done enough.

00:05:47.555 --> 00:05:50.642 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I suppose you're right.

00:05:50.725 --> 00:05:53.103 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Shinra.
I feel better. Uh.

00:05:53.186 --> 00:05:56.439 position:50% align:center
It's time for morning assembly!
So finish eating already!

00:05:56.523 --> 00:05:59.317 position:50% align:center
All of you need to hurry back to
your appointed stations and--

00:05:59.401 --> 00:06:00.610 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:04.447 position:50% align:center
If you would excuse me,
ma'am, I need mayonnaise.

00:06:04.531 --> 00:06:06.366 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Whoa. Hey!

00:06:08.827 --> 00:06:11.871 position:50% align:center
You're such a friggin' jerk!
Stay away from meow, will you?

00:06:11.955 --> 00:06:14.708 position:50% align:center
I was just sitting still
and then you fell on me!

00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:16.751 position:50% align:center
[bell ringing]

00:06:16.835 --> 00:06:19.004 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Is that the morning
assembly bell?

00:06:19.087 --> 00:06:22.298 position:50% align:center
That's the alarm! It means
an Infernal's appeared!

00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:24.342 position:50% align:center
Juggernaut, find
Lieutenant Hoshimiya!

00:06:24.426 --> 00:06:25.969 position:50% align:center
Kishiri, Lieutenant Li!

00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:26.970 position:50% align:center
And you two from the 8th

00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:29.055 position:50% align:center
should report to
Lieutenant Flam!

00:06:46.031 --> 00:06:48.324 position:50% align:center
[KARIM] This is another
mass combustion incident.

00:06:48.408 --> 00:06:50.994 position:50% align:center
A total of five victims
have turned Infernal.

00:06:51.077 --> 00:06:53.788 position:50% align:center
Nozaka Squad, get
civilians out of the area.

00:06:53.872 --> 00:06:57.459 position:50% align:center
Matsuda Squad, spread out and
keep the rest of us informed.

00:06:57.542 --> 00:06:59.836 position:50% align:center
The rest of us will search
for the Infernals.

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:01.755 position:50% align:center
Let's put them to rest quickly.

00:07:01.838 --> 00:07:03.256 position:50% align:center
[1ST MEMBERS]
Sir!

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:07.344 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Awesome. This company's
a well-oiled machine.

00:07:09.054 --> 00:07:10.388 position:50% align:center
[KARIM]
You two stand by.

00:07:10.472 --> 00:07:12.432 position:50% align:center
Go to Matsuda Squad
if you see something.

00:07:12.515 --> 00:07:13.933 position:50% align:center
Please let us help you, sir!

00:07:14.017 --> 00:07:16.895 position:50% align:center
Throwing in new recruits
would only cause confusion.

00:07:16.978 --> 00:07:20.440 position:50% align:center
The best thing you can do is
just stay right here, ya hear?

00:07:40.418 --> 00:07:42.170 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA chuckles]

00:07:42.253 --> 00:07:43.755 position:50% align:center
Hey, you all right?

00:07:47.717 --> 00:07:48.760 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Huh?

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.098 position:50% align:center
What happened?

00:07:55.684 --> 00:07:57.894 position:50% align:center
[VICTIM A screams]

00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:03.274 position:50% align:center
That's our culprit. After 'em!

00:08:03.358 --> 00:08:05.819 position:50% align:center
Shouldn't we stop
the Infernal first?

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:10.448 position:50% align:center
No, we'll have to leave him
to Company 1 for now.

00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:16.454 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
You'll pay for this.

00:08:16.538 --> 00:08:20.083 position:50% align:center
Fire Soldiers are supposed
to protect people!

00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:22.794 position:50% align:center
You can't run faster
than I can fly!

00:08:24.546 --> 00:08:25.964 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:26.047 --> 00:08:27.048 position:50% align:center
[REKKA]
Shinra!

00:08:27.132 --> 00:08:28.508 position:50% align:center
[KARIM]
What are you doing?

00:08:28.591 --> 00:08:31.386 position:50% align:center
I thought I ordered
you to stay behind.

00:08:34.139 --> 00:08:37.142 position:50% align:center
Answer me: What are you
two doing back here?

00:08:37.225 --> 00:08:38.476 position:50% align:center
Talk or-- Uh!

00:08:39.602 --> 00:08:42.981 position:50% align:center
We don't get to visit Shinjuku
much. We kinda got lost.

00:08:43.064 --> 00:08:47.068 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR groaning]

00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:50.363 position:50% align:center
We finished, Lieutenant Rekka.

00:08:50.447 --> 00:08:52.866 position:50% align:center
All the Infernals have
been laid to rest.

00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:55.827 position:50% align:center
[REKKA]
Got it. Good work, Tamaki.

00:08:59.456 --> 00:09:01.750 position:50% align:center
'Kay. Let's head back.

00:09:06.588 --> 00:09:09.883 position:50% align:center
Shinra, why'd you stop me?

00:09:20.143 --> 00:09:22.062 position:50% align:center
Someone's been making Infernals

00:09:22.145 --> 00:09:24.814 position:50% align:center
and the lieutenants are
our top suspects, right?

00:09:24.898 --> 00:09:27.233 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but we can't tell
friend from foe here,

00:09:27.317 --> 00:09:29.110 position:50% align:center
so we need to wait.

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:34.616 position:50% align:center
If we'd acted then, we might've
been silenced for good.

00:09:34.699 --> 00:09:36.910 position:50% align:center
So what do you think
we should do now?

00:09:36.993 --> 00:09:38.119 position:50% align:center
That man was killed.

00:09:38.203 --> 00:09:40.997 position:50% align:center
I know. I saw it
with my own eyes.

00:09:41.081 --> 00:09:42.874 position:50% align:center
He pressed a bottle
containing an insect

00:09:42.957 --> 00:09:44.751 position:50% align:center
against that civilian's back.

00:09:44.834 --> 00:09:46.044 position:50% align:center
And right after that...

00:09:46.127 --> 00:09:48.088 position:50% align:center
The man turned Infernal.

00:09:48.171 --> 00:09:49.839 position:50% align:center
It's pure evil.

00:09:49.923 --> 00:09:52.634 position:50% align:center
How can a Fire Soldier
justify doing this?

00:09:52.717 --> 00:09:55.345 position:50% align:center
Talked to a nun who was
passing by earlier.

00:09:55.428 --> 00:09:58.598 position:50% align:center
Only the lieutenants wear the
robes you saw on the culprit.

00:09:58.682 --> 00:10:01.726 position:50% align:center
So we should start by
investigating Karim and Rekka.

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:03.770 position:50% align:center
You talk like that'll be simple,

00:10:03.853 --> 00:10:05.730 position:50% align:center
but they're both
formidable foes.

00:10:05.814 --> 00:10:07.107 position:50% align:center
How's that matter?

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:10.026 position:50% align:center
Strong or not, they should
be held accountable.

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:14.948 position:50% align:center
Let's start by searching
Karim's room.

00:10:15.031 --> 00:10:16.199 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
You sure he's not in it?

00:10:16.282 --> 00:10:18.284 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I asked Juggernaut
to make somethin' up

00:10:18.368 --> 00:10:20.328 position:50% align:center
and keep him occupied.

00:10:20.412 --> 00:10:22.580 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR] Did you tell
Juggernaut about our mission?

00:10:22.664 --> 00:10:27.043 position:50% align:center
No need. He seems to have
taken a liking to Tamaki.

00:10:27.127 --> 00:10:29.170 position:50% align:center
So when I said I could get
her phone number for him,

00:10:29.254 --> 00:10:32.507 position:50% align:center
he volunteered to help us out,
no questions asked.

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:36.302 position:50% align:center
But anyway, why are you
wearing that get-up?

00:10:36.386 --> 00:10:37.637 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
I made a job change.

00:10:37.721 --> 00:10:39.764 position:50% align:center
Went from knight to assassin.

00:10:43.727 --> 00:10:46.688 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] So after all that
insufferable "knight" talk,

00:10:46.771 --> 00:10:47.981 position:50% align:center
you're--

00:10:48.064 --> 00:10:49.649 position:50% align:center
Still a knight.

00:10:58.491 --> 00:10:59.659 position:50% align:center
What was that?

00:10:59.743 --> 00:11:01.703 position:50% align:center
I call this a mini Excalibur.

00:11:01.786 --> 00:11:03.413 position:50% align:center
Make 'em from a
sheet of plastic,

00:11:03.496 --> 00:11:06.207 position:50% align:center
which means they all tend
to melt after one use.

00:11:06.291 --> 00:11:07.584 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
You idiot!

00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:09.961 position:50% align:center
This'll make it obvious that
someone broke in here!

00:11:10.045 --> 00:11:11.963 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
You don't sound like yourself.

00:11:12.047 --> 00:11:15.467 position:50% align:center
Guess you lost your nerve
after Burns kicked your ass.

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:16.676 position:50% align:center
What'd you say?

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.428 position:50% align:center
If the mystery of
human combustion

00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:19.637 position:50% align:center
could be solved cleanly,

00:11:19.721 --> 00:11:22.223 position:50% align:center
then someone would've
done it by now.

00:11:25.393 --> 00:11:28.480 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] I'd be surprised
to see you solve anything.

00:11:28.563 --> 00:11:29.856 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR chuckles]

00:11:49.501 --> 00:11:50.460 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:50.543 --> 00:11:52.045 position:50% align:center
That vial!

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:56.132 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR] So one of these
can turn someone Infernal?

00:11:56.216 --> 00:11:59.928 position:50% align:center
That settles it.
Karim Flam is our culprit.

00:12:01.471 --> 00:12:02.555 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR, SHINRA gasp]

00:12:04.182 --> 00:12:06.434 position:50% align:center
I left that buggy little
bug there as bait

00:12:06.518 --> 00:12:08.228 position:50% align:center
to lure the two of you out.

00:12:08.311 --> 00:12:11.106 position:50% align:center
Your behavior in that back alley
was suspicious earlier,

00:12:11.189 --> 00:12:13.316 position:50% align:center
so I thought I'd test you.

00:12:15.318 --> 00:12:18.071 position:50% align:center
[KARIM] So the 8th trailed
the same trail I'm trailing.

00:12:18.154 --> 00:12:19.322 position:50% align:center
Interesting.

00:12:19.406 --> 00:12:20.907 position:50% align:center
What're you getting at?

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:22.242 position:50% align:center
Those insects.

00:12:22.325 --> 00:12:24.661 position:50% align:center
I wanna catch the louse
who's spreading them, too.

00:12:24.744 --> 00:12:26.121 position:50% align:center
So we're on the same side, then.

00:12:26.204 --> 00:12:28.415 position:50% align:center
How do we know we can trust you?

00:12:28.498 --> 00:12:30.625 position:50% align:center
[KARIM] You saw the
culprit at work, right?

00:12:30.709 --> 00:12:33.795 position:50% align:center
Judging from the fact that I'm
one of your first suspects,

00:12:33.878 --> 00:12:36.506 position:50% align:center
they must've been
in robes like mine.

00:12:38.258 --> 00:12:40.176 position:50% align:center
[KARIM]
It wasn't me.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.971 position:50% align:center
And there was just one
solitary single person there

00:12:43.054 --> 00:12:45.265 position:50% align:center
who wore robes like mine.

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:49.019 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Rekka Hoshimiya.

00:12:51.229 --> 00:12:52.605 position:50% align:center
[KARIM]
Had a case two months ago

00:12:52.689 --> 00:12:55.525 position:50% align:center
where a large group of kids
caught fire all at once.

00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:57.694 position:50% align:center
I knew it couldn't be natural.

00:12:57.777 --> 00:13:01.281 position:50% align:center
And then I found the insect,
left behind at the scene.

00:13:01.364 --> 00:13:03.908 position:50% align:center
So he was targeting children?

00:13:08.121 --> 00:13:10.540 position:50% align:center
I got a five star from
the gacha machine.

00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:12.709 position:50% align:center
Whoa, for real? You're lucky.

00:13:12.792 --> 00:13:14.210 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
Hey there, kids.

00:13:14.294 --> 00:13:15.211 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Hm?

00:13:15.295 --> 00:13:17.547 position:50% align:center
Fires sure are scary, huh?

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:20.633 position:50% align:center
You heard about how those kids
your age burned up, right?

00:13:20.717 --> 00:13:22.135 position:50% align:center
Well, listen,

00:13:22.218 --> 00:13:25.347 position:50% align:center
there's a way to make sure
the flames can never get you.

00:13:27.015 --> 00:13:30.352 position:50% align:center
I can show you if you
come with me, 'kay?

00:13:46.076 --> 00:13:48.536 position:50% align:center
What're you trying to do, Rekka?

00:14:04.928 --> 00:14:06.971 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
'Kay! Let's go!

00:14:08.098 --> 00:14:10.934 position:50% align:center
Tamaki, thanks for
rounding everyone up.

00:14:11.017 --> 00:14:12.602 position:50% align:center
I've finally found
a sacred prayer

00:14:12.686 --> 00:14:15.980 position:50% align:center
that can make people immune
to Infernalization!

00:14:16.064 --> 00:14:18.775 position:50% align:center
If I can save these kids
from the fear of flames,

00:14:18.858 --> 00:14:21.945 position:50% align:center
then I can die with
a smile on my face!

00:14:22.028 --> 00:14:24.114 position:50% align:center
That's great, Lieutenant.

00:14:24.197 --> 00:14:26.449 position:50% align:center
I only wish I could
save more right now.

00:14:26.533 --> 00:14:29.285 position:50% align:center
I'm such a failure. Damn it all!

00:14:29.369 --> 00:14:31.913 position:50% align:center
Father, is it really true?

00:14:31.996 --> 00:14:34.708 position:50% align:center
Can you actually protect my
kids from becoming Infernals?

00:14:34.791 --> 00:14:36.126 position:50% align:center
'Course I can!

00:14:36.209 --> 00:14:38.795 position:50% align:center
You kept it secret, right?
Can't have any squabbling.

00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:41.506 position:50% align:center
One of my friends from
school got burned up.

00:14:41.589 --> 00:14:43.133 position:50% align:center
It was really sad.

00:14:43.216 --> 00:14:44.509 position:50% align:center
I'm scared that I'll be next,

00:14:44.592 --> 00:14:46.761 position:50% align:center
but you're saying you
can keep me safe, right?

00:14:46.845 --> 00:14:48.972 position:50% align:center
You got it, bud!

00:14:49.055 --> 00:14:50.515 position:50% align:center
Don't be scared!

00:14:50.598 --> 00:14:52.976 position:50% align:center
Now that you're here with me,
everything's gonna be fine!

00:14:53.059 --> 00:14:56.646 position:50% align:center
We'll get stronger so we can
never be beaten by the flames!

00:15:00.108 --> 00:15:02.986 position:50% align:center
[REKKA] Tamaki, would you
mind stepping outside?

00:15:03.069 --> 00:15:04.946 position:50% align:center
I'd like to focus on the prayer.

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:06.448 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
Huh?

00:15:06.531 --> 00:15:08.742 position:50% align:center
[REKKA] You've been a great
help. Thanks for everything.

00:15:08.825 --> 00:15:11.286 position:50% align:center
I would do anything for
you, Lieutenant Rekka,

00:15:11.369 --> 00:15:14.289 position:50% align:center
but I was hoping you might
let me see the prayer, too.

00:15:14.372 --> 00:15:15.957 position:50% align:center
Just so I can keep helping.

00:15:16.041 --> 00:15:18.668 position:50% align:center
[REKKA]
My stars!

00:15:18.752 --> 00:15:20.378 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Tamaki!

00:15:20.462 --> 00:15:24.132 position:50% align:center
It's okay. You're really
making too much of it.

00:15:24.215 --> 00:15:29.220 position:50% align:center
[REKKA] No, I'm not. I'm so
grateful for you, Tamaki!

00:15:29.304 --> 00:15:30.096 position:50% align:center
I--

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:32.474 position:50% align:center
[REKKA]
You deserve a rest!

00:15:33.558 --> 00:15:35.018 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:15:36.186 --> 00:15:39.773 position:50% align:center
Now then, all of you
have been chosen.

00:15:39.856 --> 00:15:42.734 position:50% align:center
You're going to help me find
a host for the Pilot Light.

00:15:42.817 --> 00:15:46.488 position:50% align:center
Please. We've changed
our minds. Let us go!

00:15:46.571 --> 00:15:48.531 position:50% align:center
[REKKA] You wanna let
your children's futures

00:15:48.615 --> 00:15:50.158 position:50% align:center
go up in smoke?

00:15:50.241 --> 00:15:52.577 position:50% align:center
Sounds like you've
failed as a mother.

00:15:55.497 --> 00:15:56.748 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:56.831 --> 00:15:58.833 position:50% align:center
[CHILD B]
What's wrong, Mommy?

00:16:00.543 --> 00:16:02.712 position:50% align:center
[MOTHER A roars]

00:16:02.796 --> 00:16:05.840 position:50% align:center
Return to the great
flame of fire.

00:16:14.933 --> 00:16:17.394 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR] You're about to
go look for Rekka, right?

00:16:17.477 --> 00:16:19.145 position:50% align:center
We're coming with you.

00:16:19.229 --> 00:16:21.272 position:50% align:center
[KARIM]
Company 1'll sort this out.

00:16:21.356 --> 00:16:23.525 position:50% align:center
Outsiders like you
should stay out of it.

00:16:23.608 --> 00:16:24.609 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
With respect, sir,

00:16:24.693 --> 00:16:26.861 position:50% align:center
we're currently assigned
to Karim Squad.

00:16:26.945 --> 00:16:29.322 position:50% align:center
Then consider this an
order from your lieutenant.

00:16:29.406 --> 00:16:30.740 position:50% align:center
Do not come with me.

00:16:30.824 --> 00:16:33.118 position:50% align:center
As if we have to
take orders from you.

00:16:33.201 --> 00:16:35.829 position:50% align:center
We're both with
Company 8, remember?

00:16:40.458 --> 00:16:43.712 position:50% align:center
So, you two are my squad
'cause you're serving under me,

00:16:43.795 --> 00:16:48.383 position:50% align:center
but you aren't my squad
'cause you're not under me.

00:16:48.466 --> 00:16:51.636 position:50% align:center
Feel free to feel free, then.

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:55.098 position:50% align:center
[CHILDREN crying, whimpering]

00:16:55.181 --> 00:16:57.267 position:50% align:center
Well, that one's a no-go.

00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:58.393 position:50% align:center
But it won't be a problem

00:16:58.476 --> 00:17:01.229 position:50% align:center
as long as one of
you kids can do it.

00:17:01.312 --> 00:17:02.772 position:50% align:center
C'mon, stop crying!

00:17:02.856 --> 00:17:05.358 position:50% align:center
You can't beat the flames
if you're this weak.

00:17:05.442 --> 00:17:07.610 position:50% align:center
You've gotta act
strong to get strong.

00:17:07.694 --> 00:17:09.446 position:50% align:center
That is what you want, right?

00:17:09.529 --> 00:17:11.281 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Let's beat the flames!

00:17:11.364 --> 00:17:13.825 position:50% align:center
[coughing]

00:17:16.453 --> 00:17:20.915 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI] Lieutenant Rekka?
What's going on here?

00:17:20.999 --> 00:17:23.168 position:50% align:center
[REKKA] I wanted you to
live and take the blame,

00:17:23.251 --> 00:17:25.086 position:50% align:center
but I guess I should'a
squeezed harder.

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:27.922 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
Huh? What do you mean, sir?

00:17:28.006 --> 00:17:29.424 position:50% align:center
[REKKA]
Don't sweat it, Tamaki.

00:17:29.507 --> 00:17:30.759 position:50% align:center
You don't need to understand.

00:17:30.842 --> 00:17:33.511 position:50% align:center
You just need to be
brave. Like these kids.

00:17:33.595 --> 00:17:35.889 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
No. This can't be real.

00:17:35.972 --> 00:17:40.226 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me... You're the one
who's been making Infernals?

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:41.644 position:50% align:center
I adored you, Lieutenant.

00:17:41.728 --> 00:17:44.230 position:50% align:center
There was no one I
believed in more than y--

00:17:45.482 --> 00:17:47.734 position:50% align:center
[REKKA]
You still adore me, don't you?

00:17:47.817 --> 00:17:49.194 position:50% align:center
Or is your heart so lukewarm

00:17:49.277 --> 00:17:52.280 position:50% align:center
that'cha let your feelings
change at the drop of a hat?

00:17:52.364 --> 00:17:54.074 position:50% align:center
[REKKA screams]

00:17:54.157 --> 00:17:55.700 position:50% align:center
[REKKA]
I refuse to surrender!

00:17:55.784 --> 00:17:59.245 position:50% align:center
No matter how many innocent
children have to be sacrificed,

00:17:59.329 --> 00:18:02.624 position:50% align:center
I will never give up,
understand?!

00:18:02.707 --> 00:18:05.627 position:50% align:center
I will keep creating Infernals
for the Evangelist,

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:08.838 position:50% align:center
till I finally find someone
who can host the Pilot Light!

00:18:08.922 --> 00:18:12.384 position:50% align:center
[screaming]

00:18:12.467 --> 00:18:14.010 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
You were always this awkward,

00:18:14.094 --> 00:18:16.304 position:50% align:center
strangely hot-blooded, guy.

00:18:16.388 --> 00:18:18.556 position:50% align:center
I thought it was so cool
how driven you were

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:21.559 position:50% align:center
and how nothing got you down.

00:18:21.643 --> 00:18:23.520 position:50% align:center
But now I'm finding
out that you're just

00:18:23.603 --> 00:18:26.022 position:50% align:center
a hot-blooded son of a bitch!

00:18:26.106 --> 00:18:27.732 position:50% align:center
[REKKA]
My stars!

00:18:31.653 --> 00:18:34.906 position:50% align:center
Lie there and be quiet
like a good little girl.

00:18:34.989 --> 00:18:37.742 position:50% align:center
You-- You're a--

00:18:37.826 --> 00:18:39.911 position:50% align:center
Okay. It's your turn now.

00:18:39.994 --> 00:18:41.162 position:50% align:center
Put me down!

00:18:41.246 --> 00:18:42.122 position:50% align:center
I don't wanna.

00:18:42.205 --> 00:18:43.415 position:50% align:center
--Oh, no! Tak-kun!
--Lemme go!

00:18:43.498 --> 00:18:46.710 position:50% align:center
[REKKA]
Here goes, Tak-kun. Get ready.

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:49.462 position:50% align:center
He's gonna burn!

00:18:49.546 --> 00:18:50.255 position:50% align:center
[REKKA]
Tak-kun!

00:18:50.338 --> 00:18:55.260 position:50% align:center
[screaming]

00:19:04.185 --> 00:19:06.271 position:50% align:center
What was that sound?

[screaming]

00:19:08.982 --> 00:19:10.108 position:50% align:center
Hang in there!

00:19:10.191 --> 00:19:13.028 position:50% align:center
I know that it burns,
but you can take it!

00:19:13.111 --> 00:19:14.487 position:50% align:center
This is wrong.

00:19:14.571 --> 00:19:15.947 position:50% align:center
[REKKA]
Don't give up, Tak-kun!

00:19:16.031 --> 00:19:19.325 position:50% align:center
Fight! Fight for your life!

00:19:19.409 --> 00:19:20.827 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:31.046 --> 00:19:34.841 position:50% align:center
He didn't turn Infernal.
How can that be?

00:19:38.553 --> 00:19:40.597 position:50% align:center
This means that he's compatible.

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:43.058 position:50% align:center
At long last, I pulled it off!

00:19:43.141 --> 00:19:45.769 position:50% align:center
I found a host
for the Pilot Light!

00:19:45.852 --> 00:19:47.395 position:50% align:center
That's great,
but it doesn't mean

00:19:47.479 --> 00:19:49.314 position:50% align:center
the rest of you
are off the hook.

00:19:49.397 --> 00:19:52.734 position:50% align:center
So let's take on the Pilot Light
and earn victory for tomorrow!

00:19:52.817 --> 00:19:54.986 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:57.655 position:50% align:center
If you've got a fighting
spirit, you'll be fine.

00:19:57.739 --> 00:20:02.702 position:50% align:center
Rev yourself up and win! Fire!

00:20:02.786 --> 00:20:06.956 position:50% align:center
Please just... stop.
Let 'em go.

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:09.250 position:50% align:center
Someone...

00:20:09.334 --> 00:20:11.628 position:50% align:center
Someone make him...

00:20:11.711 --> 00:20:15.548 position:50% align:center
Somebody come and help us!

00:20:21.054 --> 00:20:23.598 position:50% align:center
[REKKA]
What was that, Tamaki?

00:20:25.225 --> 00:20:26.976 position:50% align:center
[REKKA] And you were
such an outstanding,

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:29.187 position:50% align:center
obedient subordinate!

00:20:33.858 --> 00:20:35.985 position:50% align:center
What the hell's
gotten into you?!

00:20:36.069 --> 00:20:37.654 position:50% align:center
There are children watching!

00:20:37.737 --> 00:20:40.740 position:50% align:center
How can you let them
see you like this?!

00:20:40.824 --> 00:20:42.367 position:50% align:center
They're giving this
everything they have,

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:44.202 position:50% align:center
and they're only kids!

00:20:44.285 --> 00:20:46.371 position:50% align:center
I put my faith in you, Tamaki.

00:20:46.454 --> 00:20:49.374 position:50% align:center
I believed you could
take the fall for me!

00:20:49.457 --> 00:20:51.042 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
I cared for you so much.

00:20:51.126 --> 00:20:52.752 position:50% align:center
[REKKA]
I trusted you!

00:20:52.836 --> 00:20:56.131 position:50% align:center
I trusted you and no one else!

00:20:56.214 --> 00:20:58.425 position:50% align:center
Now I'll have to change
the plan and kill you.

00:20:58.508 --> 00:21:00.343 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI] The hot-blooded,
gentle lieutenant...

00:21:00.427 --> 00:21:04.848 position:50% align:center
[REKKA] I'll make it look like
you burned yourself to death!

00:21:04.931 --> 00:21:08.518 position:50% align:center
Damn it. This is hard
for me, too, you know!

00:21:08.601 --> 00:21:11.730 position:50% align:center
I didn't want it to go this way!

00:21:11.813 --> 00:21:14.107 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:17.402 position:50% align:center
[REKKA] Do you see how
my fist weeps for you?

00:21:17.485 --> 00:21:18.862 position:50% align:center
I'll be right beside you

00:21:18.945 --> 00:21:21.740 position:50% align:center
all the way to the
end, okay, Tamaki?!

00:21:21.823 --> 00:21:24.492 position:50% align:center
You said you would
do anything for me...

00:21:24.576 --> 00:21:25.910 position:50% align:center
...so die in my place!

00:21:25.994 --> 00:21:27.203 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
Somebody...

00:21:27.287 --> 00:21:30.874 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI] I looked up to you.
More than anyone.

00:21:30.957 --> 00:21:32.667 position:50% align:center
Help me, please.

00:22:04.657 --> 00:22:06.034 position:50% align:center
Hey, Tamaki.

00:22:06.117 --> 00:22:07.660 position:50% align:center
You all right?
