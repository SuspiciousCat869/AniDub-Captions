00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:28.695 position:50% align:center
[IRIS] As the world man had
built was buried in ash,

00:00:28.778 --> 00:00:30.739 position:50% align:center
a leader appeared.

00:00:30.822 --> 00:00:35.118 position:50% align:center
A man who would later be
known as Raffles the 1st.

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:37.620 position:50% align:center
Raffles and his disciples
embarked on a quest

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:40.707 position:50% align:center
to find new light, and they did.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.044 position:50% align:center
What Raffles found was
an unsullied flame.

00:00:44.127 --> 00:00:46.963 position:50% align:center
The spark that would
kindle an Empire.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.770 position:50% align:center
Here I come. You ready?

00:01:01.853 --> 00:01:03.772 position:50% align:center
You're no brother of mine!

00:01:03.855 --> 00:01:05.815 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.321 position:50% align:center
Just give up.
I find you repugnant.

00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:13.990 position:50% align:center
And it's hard to believe that
you have memories of me!

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:15.408 position:50% align:center
I have a few.

00:01:15.492 --> 00:01:18.036 position:50% align:center
I remember that as a baby,
you used to laugh and cry.

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.163 position:50% align:center
You acted way more human!

00:01:23.833 --> 00:01:26.544 position:50% align:center
Did the darkness scare ya?
Well, it's all right now.

00:01:26.628 --> 00:01:29.422 position:50% align:center
Your big brother's got
your back, okay?

00:01:29.506 --> 00:01:32.217 position:50% align:center
What was that?
A memory of yours?

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.177 position:50% align:center
What a revolting image.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.762 position:50% align:center
I said to get out of my head!

00:01:35.845 --> 00:01:37.263 position:50% align:center
I need you to see
that we're brothers!

00:01:37.347 --> 00:01:38.723 position:50% align:center
[SHO]
Stop this!

00:01:38.807 --> 00:01:40.433 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
No way!

00:01:40.517 --> 00:01:43.561 position:50% align:center
I'm not stopping until
I get the real you back!

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.482 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
I'll go faster than light.

00:01:47.565 --> 00:01:50.402 position:50% align:center
Fly back to the time
when we were a family.

00:01:50.485 --> 00:01:52.278 position:50% align:center
And take hold of it!

00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:02.706 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT D]
That Shinra guy's a real devil.

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:03.998 position:50% align:center
He's so creepy.

00:02:04.082 --> 00:02:06.334 position:50% align:center
Yeah, he is.
Look at that grin.

00:02:06.418 --> 00:02:08.962 position:50% align:center
Word is, he wore the
same vicious smile

00:02:09.045 --> 00:02:11.297 position:50% align:center
the day his family was killed.

00:02:12.924 --> 00:02:17.262 position:50% align:center
[SHO] Are all of these
Shinra Kusakabe's memories?

00:02:19.431 --> 00:02:20.849 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Just hold on.

00:02:20.932 --> 00:02:24.185 position:50% align:center
[SHO] He went past the speed
of light, backwards in time,

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.272 position:50% align:center
and linked me to
his past experiences.

00:02:32.444 --> 00:02:34.863 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Honestly,
I don't know how I'll feel

00:02:34.946 --> 00:02:36.406 position:50% align:center
when I see you, Sho.

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:37.907 position:50% align:center
It's been years.

00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:39.534 position:50% align:center
But even now, I'm bound to you

00:02:39.617 --> 00:02:42.245 position:50% align:center
by the promise
I made our mother.

00:02:42.328 --> 00:02:44.831 position:50% align:center
You're family,
and I'll protect you.

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:49.336 position:50% align:center
[SHO]
Promises. Family bonds.

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:52.130 position:50% align:center
What meaning is there
in such things?

00:02:53.757 --> 00:02:55.342 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Good question.

00:02:55.425 --> 00:02:58.178 position:50% align:center
I do wanna honor the
promise I made to Mom,

00:02:58.261 --> 00:03:00.680 position:50% align:center
but now that I've
actually met you,

00:03:00.764 --> 00:03:03.767 position:50% align:center
that isn't what's
driving me anymore.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.729 position:50% align:center
Your petty motives are
of no interest to me.

00:03:07.812 --> 00:03:09.564 position:50% align:center
Is that a fact?

00:03:15.612 --> 00:03:17.947 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT E]
Look. Kusakabe's here.

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:19.491 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT F]
The mother-killer?

00:03:19.574 --> 00:03:21.701 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT B] Yeah. I heard he
killed his baby brother, too.

00:03:21.785 --> 00:03:23.119 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT C]
Really? How?

00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:26.790 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT G] He burned them up.
Like the devil he is.

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:28.541 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
It wasn't me.

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:31.378 position:50% align:center
When my home burned,
I saw the real culprit.

00:03:31.461 --> 00:03:34.172 position:50% align:center
It looked like some
kind of... demon.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.342 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
I swear, sooner or later,

00:03:37.425 --> 00:03:40.762 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna find that thing,
and tear it a new one.

00:03:40.845 --> 00:03:42.472 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT B]
Did you see his face just now?

00:03:42.555 --> 00:03:43.682 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Ever since the fire,

00:03:43.765 --> 00:03:45.058 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT D]
What a creep.

00:03:45.141 --> 00:03:49.604 position:50% align:center
my face tenses up into
this grin when I'm nervous.

00:03:49.688 --> 00:03:52.691 position:50% align:center
They think I killed Sho?

00:03:52.774 --> 00:03:54.943 position:50% align:center
I am not some devil!

00:03:56.111 --> 00:03:59.322 position:50% align:center
Wish I could see you again.

00:03:59.406 --> 00:04:02.617 position:50% align:center
Mom. Sho.

00:04:04.744 --> 00:04:07.455 position:50% align:center
Why are you showing me
these irrelevant memories?

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:10.709 position:50% align:center
Nothing you do will
make us brothers again.

00:04:12.627 --> 00:04:15.505 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty sure that
we're the same, Sho.

00:04:15.588 --> 00:04:18.591 position:50% align:center
We were normal kids who
grinned when we were happy.

00:04:18.675 --> 00:04:21.261 position:50% align:center
Why can't we smile
for real anymore?

00:04:21.344 --> 00:04:23.388 position:50% align:center
I don't have a past, understand?

00:04:23.471 --> 00:04:25.640 position:50% align:center
I have no need of one.

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:36.568 position:50% align:center
[inaudible]

00:04:40.739 --> 00:04:42.824 position:50% align:center
This one feels different.

00:04:42.907 --> 00:04:45.869 position:50% align:center
Could it be a memory
that I've lost?

00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:50.749 position:50% align:center
Twelve long years ago,
we were just an ordinary family.

00:04:50.832 --> 00:04:54.544 position:50% align:center
You, and me, and Mom.

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:59.090 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Before the fire
that tore us apart,

00:04:59.174 --> 00:05:02.427 position:50% align:center
you and I could smile without
even thinking about it.

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.639 position:50% align:center
Back in those days,
it was normal for us.

00:05:06.723 --> 00:05:09.392 position:50% align:center
Because we were happy back then.

00:05:09.476 --> 00:05:11.227 position:50% align:center
Because we had each other.

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:13.313 position:50% align:center
And we had her.

00:05:13.396 --> 00:05:16.274 position:50% align:center
Hey, Sho, Shinra.

00:05:17.609 --> 00:05:19.486 position:50% align:center
I love you both.

00:05:20.528 --> 00:05:23.281 position:50% align:center
[SHO]
Is that... our mother?

00:05:23.365 --> 00:05:26.743 position:50% align:center
Hey. What are you makin'
us for dinner, Momma?

00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:28.119 position:50% align:center
Some hamburgers.

00:05:28.203 --> 00:05:29.120 position:50% align:center
That sounds good.

00:05:29.204 --> 00:05:31.206 position:50% align:center
[SHO crying]

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:34.000 position:50% align:center
I'll be right there, Sho.
Let me wash my hands.

00:05:34.084 --> 00:05:35.877 position:50% align:center
Don't worry. I can help out.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.088 position:50% align:center
Leave it to me.
I'll calm him down!

00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:40.215 position:50% align:center
I'm on my way, Sho!

00:05:41.841 --> 00:05:46.262 position:50% align:center
It's okay! Your big brother's
here, so don't be scared.

00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:50.433 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Guess the wind
must've blown it down.

00:05:50.517 --> 00:05:54.187 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, buddy. I'll get
that off you real quick.

00:05:56.523 --> 00:05:57.691 position:50% align:center
[SHO]
Dark.

00:05:57.774 --> 00:05:59.150 position:50% align:center
Scared.

00:05:59.234 --> 00:06:00.777 position:50% align:center
Alone.

00:06:04.698 --> 00:06:06.825 position:50% align:center
[SHO]
Light.

00:06:06.908 --> 00:06:08.493 position:50% align:center
Bet it was dark, huh?

00:06:08.576 --> 00:06:10.120 position:50% align:center
Well, you're all right now, Sho.

00:06:10.203 --> 00:06:13.039 position:50% align:center
Your big brother came
to save the day.

00:06:14.833 --> 00:06:16.876 position:50% align:center
Hey, now, don't cry.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.713 position:50% align:center
You've got your own
personal hero, Sho.

00:06:21.506 --> 00:06:23.967 position:50% align:center
Aw, that make ya feel better?

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.178 position:50% align:center
Whenever you need my help,
I'll come runnin'.

00:06:27.262 --> 00:06:28.722 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:41.443 position:50% align:center
You were in the
dark a long time.

00:06:41.526 --> 00:06:45.363 position:50% align:center
I didn't mean to leave you
by yourself. I'm sorry.

00:06:49.034 --> 00:06:51.327 position:50% align:center
Let me get you out
of here, okay?

00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:53.496 position:50% align:center
I'll take you someplace bright.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.332 position:50% align:center
You'll have nothing to fear.

00:06:56.416 --> 00:07:00.045 position:50% align:center
[SHO]
This is my... brother.

00:07:01.504 --> 00:07:03.131 position:50% align:center
Come on.

00:07:12.682 --> 00:07:15.894 position:50% align:center
Oh, no. What happened?

00:07:15.977 --> 00:07:17.228 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:21.983 --> 00:07:25.653 position:50% align:center
Listen. This isn't
your fault, Sho.

00:07:29.491 --> 00:07:30.700 position:50% align:center
Haumea!

00:07:30.784 --> 00:07:32.744 position:50% align:center
Allohello.

00:07:58.687 --> 00:08:00.647 position:50% align:center

00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:06.046 position:50% align:center
[HAUMEA]
Oh, my.

00:09:06.129 --> 00:09:07.672 position:50% align:center
It looks like he went so fast

00:09:07.756 --> 00:09:10.425 position:50% align:center
that he ended up impaling
himself on your sword.

00:09:10.508 --> 00:09:13.428 position:50% align:center
Our newest Adolla Burst
is starting to flicker.

00:09:13.511 --> 00:09:17.057 position:50% align:center
Can't let it die on us.
I'll collect him and withdraw.

00:09:19.017 --> 00:09:22.395 position:50% align:center
This is bad. Shinra's in
no shape to keep fighting.

00:09:22.479 --> 00:09:25.023 position:50% align:center
I don't believe
I've met you before.

00:09:25.106 --> 00:09:26.566 position:50% align:center
But hey, lemme guess.

00:09:26.649 --> 00:09:30.153 position:50% align:center
Are you one of the
people who stole Sho?

00:09:30.236 --> 00:09:32.697 position:50% align:center
If you find all
the Adolla Bursts,

00:09:32.781 --> 00:09:34.699 position:50% align:center
what will you do with them?

00:09:34.783 --> 00:09:37.619 position:50% align:center
The Great Cataclysm
from 250 years back

00:09:37.702 --> 00:09:39.829 position:50% align:center
didn't quite manage
to burn everything.

00:09:39.913 --> 00:09:41.873 position:50% align:center
If we collect enough
Adolla Bursts,

00:09:41.956 --> 00:09:44.084 position:50% align:center
then we can kick off
a new Great Cataclysm

00:09:44.167 --> 00:09:45.627 position:50% align:center
and finish the job!

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:46.795 position:50% align:center
So toward that end,

00:09:46.878 --> 00:09:48.546 position:50% align:center
we're looking for
Adolla Burst wielders

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:51.007 position:50% align:center
and using the bugs
to make our own.

00:09:51.091 --> 00:09:53.802 position:50% align:center
And we'll definitely
need you and Sho.

00:09:53.885 --> 00:09:55.929 position:50% align:center
Stop that! Why are you
telling him all this?

00:09:56.012 --> 00:09:57.472 position:50% align:center
Whoopsie-doopsie!

00:09:57.555 --> 00:09:58.682 position:50% align:center
Who cares?

00:09:58.765 --> 00:10:00.183 position:50% align:center
It doesn't actually
matter what he knows,

00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:02.352 position:50% align:center
he still won't be
able to stop us.

00:10:02.435 --> 00:10:06.398 position:50% align:center
But anywho, I think it's time
I picked up our new prize.

00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:07.607 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:10:07.691 --> 00:10:09.859 position:50% align:center
Oh! Somethin' on your
mind, little buddy?

00:10:09.943 --> 00:10:13.738 position:50% align:center
Before you take him, speak.
What happened 12 years ago?

00:10:13.822 --> 00:10:15.240 position:50% align:center
[HAUMEA]
You wanna know?

00:10:15.323 --> 00:10:17.701 position:50% align:center
Well, between you and me,
I'm a sucker for aggressive men.

00:10:17.784 --> 00:10:19.452 position:50% align:center
So why don't you
force me to talk?

00:10:19.536 --> 00:10:20.704 position:50% align:center
[SHO]
Stop screwing around.

00:10:20.787 --> 00:10:22.706 position:50% align:center
Right. I'll get back to work.

00:10:22.789 --> 00:10:25.542 position:50% align:center
Severed Universe.

00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:27.794 position:50% align:center
What's wrong? Nothing happened.

00:10:27.877 --> 00:10:29.838 position:50% align:center
My power failed me.

00:10:29.921 --> 00:10:32.007 position:50% align:center
Have I been cut from grace?

00:10:36.594 --> 00:10:37.846 position:50% align:center
Sho!

00:10:40.015 --> 00:10:41.433 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Sho!

00:10:49.607 --> 00:10:51.568 position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:53.903 position:50% align:center
What the--? What have you done?

00:10:53.987 --> 00:10:55.321 position:50% align:center
Wow, look at you.

00:10:55.405 --> 00:10:59.117 position:50% align:center
A sword in your chest,
yet you're this lively?

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.037 position:50% align:center
'Kay. You're gonna come
with me now, capiche?

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.664 position:50% align:center
Crap. Shinra.

00:11:06.416 --> 00:11:08.251 position:50% align:center
What the hey was that about?

00:11:08.335 --> 00:11:08.960 position:50% align:center
Whoa!

00:11:09.044 --> 00:11:11.421 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR yelling]

00:11:11.504 --> 00:11:12.964 position:50% align:center
[HAUMEA]
Owie.

00:11:13.048 --> 00:11:16.384 position:50% align:center
She forced my blade away
from her head somehow.

00:11:16.468 --> 00:11:20.805 position:50% align:center
I... wasn't able to...
save my brother.

00:11:23.683 --> 00:11:25.226 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR] I'm the one who's
gonna put you down,

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:26.519 position:50% align:center
understand, Devil?

00:11:26.603 --> 00:11:28.688 position:50% align:center
So don't you die on me.

00:11:28.772 --> 00:11:30.690 position:50% align:center
Oh, how's it goin', gentlemen?

00:11:30.774 --> 00:11:33.193 position:50% align:center
No offense, but you
weren't invited.

00:11:33.276 --> 00:11:35.945 position:50% align:center
You have to... be careful.

00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:39.366 position:50% align:center
She has this weird move
that lets her con--

00:11:39.449 --> 00:11:43.703 position:50% align:center
Just stop talking for now.
We'll take care of it.

00:11:43.787 --> 00:11:47.582 position:50% align:center
Now, you're kind of in my way,
so go take a hike, bub.

00:11:47.665 --> 00:11:48.792 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
Hmm?

00:11:49.876 --> 00:11:52.212 position:50% align:center
No dice? That's weird.

00:11:52.295 --> 00:11:54.339 position:50% align:center
What was that, some
kinda scare tactic?

00:11:54.422 --> 00:11:55.757 position:50% align:center
Come do your worst.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.093 position:50% align:center
[growls] He has plasma.

00:11:58.176 --> 00:11:59.427 position:50% align:center
That must be what
was interfering

00:11:59.511 --> 00:12:01.096 position:50% align:center
with my electric signal.

00:12:01.179 --> 00:12:02.514 position:50% align:center
How annoying!

00:12:02.597 --> 00:12:05.141 position:50% align:center
You're one pain-in-the-ass
opponent, d'you know that?

00:12:05.225 --> 00:12:07.268 position:50% align:center
Hurry, Haumea!
We're running out of time.

00:12:07.352 --> 00:12:08.353 position:50% align:center
We need to leave soon!

00:12:08.436 --> 00:12:10.522 position:50% align:center
Yeah! I'm aware,
so shut your trap!

00:12:10.605 --> 00:12:13.316 position:50% align:center
It won't even take me a second
to crush these twerps.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:16.736 position:50% align:center
Ugh! How many of you are there?

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:18.238 position:50% align:center
My Tekkyo.

00:12:18.321 --> 00:12:20.740 position:50% align:center
It looks like their
hardware fritzed out.

00:12:22.617 --> 00:12:24.828 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA] I'll keep her
distracted. Help Shinra!

00:12:24.911 --> 00:12:25.912 position:50% align:center
[MAKI, TAMAKI]
Sir!

00:12:25.995 --> 00:12:27.247 position:50% align:center
[HAUMEA]
Pew, pew!

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:28.248 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
Lieutenant!

00:12:28.331 --> 00:12:30.500 position:50% align:center
Stupid jerk. So annoying!

00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:32.627 position:50% align:center
Ugh, that plasma
screws up my signal

00:12:32.711 --> 00:12:35.213 position:50% align:center
and keeps me from hitting
their nervous systems.

00:12:35.296 --> 00:12:37.590 position:50% align:center
There are so few people who
can actually make plasma.

00:12:37.674 --> 00:12:39.718 position:50% align:center
Why'd he have to be one of 'em?

00:12:40.927 --> 00:12:41.928 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:12:46.349 --> 00:12:49.394 position:50% align:center
Shinra, you're
gonna be okay now.

00:12:51.896 --> 00:12:54.274 position:50% align:center
Ah. An earthquake.

00:12:54.357 --> 00:12:55.984 position:50% align:center
Right on schedule, too.

00:12:56.067 --> 00:12:57.402 position:50% align:center
Seems like a big one.

00:12:57.485 --> 00:12:59.529 position:50% align:center
I've got a bad
feeling about this.

00:12:59.612 --> 00:13:03.116 position:50% align:center
That's because the
Evangelist is behind it!

00:13:03.199 --> 00:13:05.410 position:50% align:center
[YONA]
Time's up, Haumea! Let's go!

00:13:05.493 --> 00:13:08.163 position:50% align:center
See ya later, if you survive.

00:13:08.246 --> 00:13:11.041 position:50% align:center
No. They have Sho.

00:13:13.126 --> 00:13:14.502 position:50% align:center
Damn it! Give my brother
back to me...

00:13:14.586 --> 00:13:17.005 position:50% align:center
Stop moving.
You're losing blood.

00:13:20.467 --> 00:13:22.635 position:50% align:center
We need to get out
of here, too!

00:13:51.873 --> 00:13:53.625 position:50% align:center
It's been ten minutes.

00:13:53.708 --> 00:13:56.002 position:50% align:center
Most quakes aren't
nearly this long.

00:13:56.086 --> 00:13:58.963 position:50% align:center
[OBI] That woman said this was
the work of the Evangelist.

00:13:59.047 --> 00:14:02.008 position:50% align:center
I don't get it.
Why would they do this?

00:14:03.134 --> 00:14:05.845 position:50% align:center
Sho. Where'd they take you?

00:14:05.929 --> 00:14:09.015 position:50% align:center
Shinra, you need to
focus on staying awake.

00:14:09.099 --> 00:14:12.227 position:50% align:center
If you wanna see your brother
again, you've gotta survive!

00:14:14.145 --> 00:14:15.939 position:50% align:center
To the emergency room?

00:14:16.022 --> 00:14:19.401 position:50% align:center
Better idea. Let's call
on our colleague.

00:14:19.484 --> 00:14:21.653 position:50% align:center
When it comes to
healing pyrokinetics,

00:14:21.736 --> 00:14:24.197 position:50% align:center
Director Huang has no match.

00:14:35.709 --> 00:14:37.419 position:50% align:center
[ASAKO]
Director Huang!

00:14:37.502 --> 00:14:39.921 position:50% align:center
Director of Medicine,
Kayoko Huang!

00:14:43.008 --> 00:14:44.467 position:50% align:center
We have an emergency!

00:14:44.551 --> 00:14:46.678 position:50% align:center
What is it, Lieutenant Hague?

00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:58.148 position:50% align:center
Hello, Captain Huang.

00:14:58.231 --> 00:15:01.651 position:50% align:center
Thanks for coming.
My crewman's badly hurt.

00:15:01.735 --> 00:15:04.487 position:50% align:center
We received prior
notice from Central.

00:15:04.571 --> 00:15:06.322 position:50% align:center
I take it this happened
in the Nether?

00:15:06.406 --> 00:15:08.575 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
It did.

00:15:08.658 --> 00:15:11.202 position:50% align:center
What exactly did you
do in the Nether?

00:15:11.286 --> 00:15:14.497 position:50% align:center
Do you know what's causing
this incessant earthquake?

00:15:14.581 --> 00:15:17.000 position:50% align:center
It almost looks like you broke
some taboo down there

00:15:17.083 --> 00:15:19.419 position:50% align:center
and incurred the wrath
of the great Sol.

00:15:19.502 --> 00:15:21.880 position:50% align:center
[OBI] Long story short,
we were hunting someone

00:15:21.963 --> 00:15:25.258 position:50% align:center
called the Evangelist who's
built a cult: The White-Clad.

00:15:25.342 --> 00:15:27.552 position:50% align:center
They turn people into Infernals.

00:15:27.635 --> 00:15:29.971 position:50% align:center
They're looking for people
who have Adolla Bursts.

00:15:30.055 --> 00:15:32.349 position:50% align:center
The flames of the
underworld, Adolla.

00:15:32.432 --> 00:15:35.143 position:50% align:center
They'll use those flames
to torch the world.

00:15:36.853 --> 00:15:40.148 position:50% align:center
We'll talk more once
I've seen to your crewman.

00:15:40.231 --> 00:15:41.816 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Captain Huang.

00:15:42.817 --> 00:15:45.862 position:50% align:center
You will be able to
save him, won't you?

00:15:47.197 --> 00:15:50.450 position:50% align:center
[HUANG] Possibly. Depends on
how much strength he has left.

00:15:50.533 --> 00:15:53.912 position:50% align:center
I'm told that his heart, lungs,
and spine were all damaged.

00:15:53.995 --> 00:15:57.999 position:50% align:center
Even if I can save his life,
he may well end up paralyzed.

00:15:58.083 --> 00:16:00.210 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:00.293 --> 00:16:02.003 position:50% align:center
The patient's a
third gen, right?

00:16:02.087 --> 00:16:04.547 position:50% align:center
And he has an Adolla
Burst, as well?

00:16:04.631 --> 00:16:05.840 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Correct.

00:16:05.924 --> 00:16:08.134 position:50% align:center
[HUANG] I don't know
if that's good or bad.

00:16:08.218 --> 00:16:10.887 position:50% align:center
This will be my first contact
with the Sacred Flame--

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:14.224 position:50% align:center
there's no telling
what'll happen.

00:16:14.307 --> 00:16:17.310 position:50% align:center
Our team would never
be the same without him.

00:16:17.394 --> 00:16:21.022 position:50% align:center
So please, Captain,
do your best.

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:26.736 position:50% align:center
[HUANG] I'll try.
I'll do everything I can.

00:16:33.785 --> 00:16:35.787 position:50% align:center
I beseech thee, Sol.

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:38.832 position:50% align:center
Please grant the light
of life to Shinra.

00:16:41.626 --> 00:16:44.629 position:50% align:center
We've successfully
removed the sword,

00:16:44.713 --> 00:16:46.881 position:50% align:center
and his vitals are
stable for now.

00:16:46.965 --> 00:16:49.509 position:50% align:center
All that's left is to
treat him with my power.

00:16:49.592 --> 00:16:51.761 position:50% align:center
Not that it would be enough
to heal a wound like this

00:16:51.845 --> 00:16:53.304 position:50% align:center
on its own.

00:16:53.388 --> 00:16:56.891 position:50% align:center
Honestly, his fate will rest
on the strength of his flame.

00:17:02.355 --> 00:17:05.775 position:50% align:center
No point waiting. The time
has come. Stay back.

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:09.154 position:50% align:center
Commencing final operation
on Shinra Kusakabe.

00:17:09.237 --> 00:17:11.489 position:50% align:center
Rod of Asclepius.

00:17:17.954 --> 00:17:21.124 position:50% align:center
Serpent, revitalize him!

00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:31.259 position:50% align:center
[OBI] It's been an hour
since the operation began.

00:17:31.343 --> 00:17:32.761 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
Where are the others?

00:17:32.844 --> 00:17:36.222 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI] Sister Iris went off
to pray for Kusakabe.

00:17:36.306 --> 00:17:38.725 position:50% align:center
Lieutenant Hinawa's
being treated himself.

00:17:38.808 --> 00:17:41.019 position:50% align:center
And Licht is following
up on some leads.

00:17:41.102 --> 00:17:42.812 position:50% align:center
But what about Vulcan?

00:17:42.896 --> 00:17:44.856 position:50% align:center
He's with Lisa at the moment.

00:17:44.939 --> 00:17:49.152 position:50% align:center
We got her back, but she looks
to be pretty traumatized.

00:17:51.071 --> 00:17:52.489 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:17:52.572 --> 00:17:54.699 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
What kinda Fire Company is this?

00:17:54.783 --> 00:17:56.659 position:50% align:center
It feels like a hospital.

00:17:56.743 --> 00:17:58.328 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
You mean you don't know?

00:17:58.411 --> 00:17:59.996 position:50% align:center
Shouldn't surprise me.

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:02.415 position:50% align:center
First off, medical treatment
is a sacred ritual

00:18:02.499 --> 00:18:06.586 position:50% align:center
that can only be performed
by the Holy Sol Temple.

00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:09.589 position:50% align:center
So since medical treatment
is Company 6's specialty,

00:18:09.673 --> 00:18:12.801 position:50% align:center
they're an entity of the Holy
Sol Temple, like the 1st.

00:18:12.884 --> 00:18:14.344 position:50% align:center
I see now.

00:18:14.427 --> 00:18:17.597 position:50% align:center
So this building is like
an ugly Holy Sol Temple,

00:18:17.681 --> 00:18:18.640 position:50% align:center
slash pseudo-hospital.

00:18:18.723 --> 00:18:21.476 position:50% align:center
No, it's a Fire Force Company!

00:18:21.559 --> 00:18:23.603 position:50% align:center
With treating the wounds
of pyrokinetics,

00:18:23.687 --> 00:18:25.146 position:50% align:center
they say no one
can hold a candle

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:27.482 position:50% align:center
to Company 6's Captain Huang.

00:18:27.565 --> 00:18:29.651 position:50% align:center
Apparently, the reason for
this is that she heals them

00:18:29.734 --> 00:18:32.028 position:50% align:center
with her own fire powers.

00:18:32.112 --> 00:18:34.197 position:50% align:center
I didn't know flames
could heal people.

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:36.491 position:50% align:center
Does anyone know how that works?

00:18:36.574 --> 00:18:38.535 position:50% align:center
[OBI] Her fire takes
the rod of Asclepius,

00:18:38.618 --> 00:18:39.953 position:50% align:center
the symbol of medicine.

00:18:40.036 --> 00:18:41.996 position:50% align:center
The serpent she makes
can heal wounds,

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:43.957 position:50% align:center
cure illnesses, you name it.

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:46.042 position:50% align:center
And when her patients
have flames of their own,

00:18:46.126 --> 00:18:48.920 position:50% align:center
she can use that to relieve
them of their suffering

00:18:49.004 --> 00:18:50.714 position:50% align:center
in an instant.

00:18:53.425 --> 00:18:55.802 position:50% align:center
His flame is quite beautiful.

00:18:55.885 --> 00:18:58.680 position:50% align:center
At this rate, he should
make a full recovery.

00:18:58.763 --> 00:19:02.851 position:50% align:center
That Adolla Burst is incredible.

00:19:02.934 --> 00:19:05.770 position:50% align:center
But I had to use all his
firepower to heal him,

00:19:05.854 --> 00:19:08.606 position:50% align:center
so he may not wake up
for a few days.

00:19:13.069 --> 00:19:15.321 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
I'm awake.

00:19:15.405 --> 00:19:19.492 position:50% align:center
Sky's clear. How long was I out?

00:19:19.576 --> 00:19:21.244 position:50% align:center
[stomach growls]

00:19:21.327 --> 00:19:23.621 position:50% align:center
What I wouldn't give
for some rice.

00:19:23.705 --> 00:19:26.166 position:50% align:center
Feel like I'm about to starve.

00:19:28.543 --> 00:19:30.712 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
What happened to Sho?

00:19:30.795 --> 00:19:33.631 position:50% align:center
I thought I'd saved him, but...

00:19:33.715 --> 00:19:36.676 position:50% align:center
He must be back with
the Evangelist by now.

00:19:43.224 --> 00:19:44.893 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
It's a beautiful sky.

00:19:44.976 --> 00:19:48.313 position:50% align:center
I should be looking
at it with my brother.

00:19:51.858 --> 00:19:52.901 position:50% align:center
Damn!

00:19:52.984 --> 00:19:54.986 position:50% align:center
[BURNS]
You woke in only three days.

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:56.946 position:50% align:center
As Captain Huang predicted.

00:19:57.030 --> 00:19:58.615 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:58.698 --> 00:20:00.617 position:50% align:center
[BURNS]
It might just be the sunlight,

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:03.036 position:50% align:center
but you don't even
look all that pale.

00:20:04.662 --> 00:20:07.040 position:50% align:center
[BURNS] That said,
you're still on the mend.

00:20:07.123 --> 00:20:08.958 position:50% align:center
At ease, soldier.

00:20:09.042 --> 00:20:11.086 position:50% align:center
I'm glad you're feeling better.

00:20:11.169 --> 00:20:13.838 position:50% align:center
With all due respect,
sir, I'm lost.

00:20:13.922 --> 00:20:15.340 position:50% align:center
What are you doing here?

00:20:15.423 --> 00:20:17.258 position:50% align:center
Checking up on you, of course.

00:20:17.342 --> 00:20:19.302 position:50% align:center
But why would you?

00:20:19.386 --> 00:20:22.097 position:50% align:center
I'm just a random
Second Class Fire Soldier

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:24.391 position:50% align:center
who's not in your company.

00:20:24.474 --> 00:20:26.351 position:50% align:center
Have I put you out?

00:20:26.434 --> 00:20:27.936 position:50% align:center
No, sir.

00:20:28.019 --> 00:20:29.688 position:50% align:center
Then if you're
feeling up to it,

00:20:29.771 --> 00:20:32.691 position:50% align:center
I think you and I should
have a little chat.

00:20:34.609 --> 00:20:37.570 position:50% align:center
About the fire that
broke out 12 years back.

00:20:37.654 --> 00:20:39.322 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:39.406 --> 00:20:41.991 position:50% align:center
[stomach growls]

00:20:42.075 --> 00:20:43.493 position:50% align:center
You get dressed first,

00:20:43.576 --> 00:20:45.954 position:50% align:center
then we can take in
some fresh air outside.

00:20:46.037 --> 00:20:48.123 position:50% align:center
I brought you some rice balls.

00:20:58.466 --> 00:21:00.760 position:50% align:center
You always eat a lot?

00:21:00.844 --> 00:21:03.638 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Probably
more than most.

00:21:03.722 --> 00:21:05.932 position:50% align:center
You've certainly grown up.

00:21:07.892 --> 00:21:11.563 position:50% align:center
So you are the Fire Soldier
that I met 12 years ago.

00:21:13.148 --> 00:21:14.315 position:50% align:center
And what's more,

00:21:14.399 --> 00:21:17.068 position:50% align:center
you saw what actually
happened on that day.

00:21:17.152 --> 00:21:19.070 position:50% align:center
Tell me. How much did you know?

00:21:19.154 --> 00:21:20.989 position:50% align:center
[BURNS]
Everything.

00:21:21.072 --> 00:21:22.323 position:50% align:center
And had I reported the truth,

00:21:22.407 --> 00:21:24.868 position:50% align:center
you would've been spared
a life of infamy.

00:21:24.951 --> 00:21:27.620 position:50% align:center
No one would've thought
you killed your family.

00:21:27.704 --> 00:21:29.873 position:50% align:center
It doesn't matter
what happened to me.

00:21:29.956 --> 00:21:31.332 position:50% align:center
What about my brother?

00:21:31.416 --> 00:21:33.668 position:50% align:center
Did you know that Sho
was still alive or not?

00:21:33.752 --> 00:21:35.879 position:50% align:center
Of course. I saw him.

00:21:35.962 --> 00:21:38.381 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Yeah? And did you
know that he was kidnapped?

00:21:38.465 --> 00:21:40.550 position:50% align:center
Taken to be raised
by the Evangelist?

00:21:40.633 --> 00:21:42.427 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I knew that, too.

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:43.678 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:43.762 --> 00:21:46.139 position:50% align:center
If you knew that, then
why didn't you help him?

00:21:46.222 --> 00:21:48.266 position:50% align:center
Why didn't you
say anything to me?

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:50.769 position:50% align:center
If I'd known, then I wouldn't
have left Sho alone

00:21:50.852 --> 00:21:53.229 position:50% align:center
in that darkness
for 12 whole years!

00:21:55.231 --> 00:21:59.194 position:50% align:center
You had 12 years to grow up--
12 years to build your strength.

00:21:59.277 --> 00:22:01.029 position:50% align:center
And still, you nearly died.

00:22:01.112 --> 00:22:03.406 position:50% align:center
The truth would've
done you no good.

00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:06.117 position:50% align:center
That stab to the
chest was a fluke.

00:22:06.201 --> 00:22:09.204 position:50% align:center
I'm stronger than I
was when we sparred.

00:22:09.287 --> 00:22:10.372 position:50% align:center
[BURNS]
I doubt it.

00:22:10.455 --> 00:22:13.208 position:50% align:center
The fluke is that you survived.

00:22:13.291 --> 00:22:16.294 position:50% align:center
If you've truly
gotten stronger...

00:22:16.378 --> 00:22:18.296 position:50% align:center
...come and prove it.
