Not the whole company's,

to confront that

00:04:47.162 --> 00:04:48.872 position:50% align:center

by destroying the 5th

I once went through something

00:05:28.787 --> 00:05:31.998 position:50% align:center
that turned my faith
in flame to despair.

00:05:32.082 --> 00:05:34.793 position:50% align:center
The more I learned of
this country, this world,

00:05:34.876 --> 00:05:37.212 position:50% align:center
the deeper that
despair took root.

00:05:37.295 --> 00:05:39.214 position:50% align:center
I told myself that
my growing cynicism

00:05:39.297 --> 00:05:41.091 position:50% align:center
was making me stronger.

00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:42.842 position:50% align:center
Smarter.

00:05:42.926 --> 00:05:45.804 position:50% align:center
I thought that to face
this crummy world,

00:05:45.887 --> 00:05:49.557 position:50% align:center
my only hope was to
fight evil with evil.

00:05:49.641 --> 00:05:53.687 position:50% align:center
Then, when a self-proclaimed
hero named Shinra beat me,

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.563 position:50% align:center
I remembered...

00:05:56.898 --> 00:06:00.777 position:50% align:center
Justice can be gentle.
Flame can keep you warm.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.613 position:50% align:center
He showed me that it's possible
to stand against evil

00:06:03.697 --> 00:06:06.908 position:50% align:center
without allowing it
to taint who you are.

00:06:06.991 --> 00:06:08.702 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
From the way you talk about him,

00:06:08.785 --> 00:06:10.829 position:50% align:center
it almost sounds like
he's your hero.

00:06:10.912 --> 00:06:14.416 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA]
Ew. No. It's nothing so trite.

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:17.711 position:50% align:center
No shame in admiring a
hero's courage, Princess.

00:06:17.794 --> 00:06:20.088 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I think his

00:06:20.171 --> 00:06:22.716 position:50% align:center
out of this dark
prison of flame.

00:06:24.217 --> 00:06:26.720 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA] So your mission is to
investigate the other companies

00:06:26.803 --> 00:06:29.347 position:50% align:center
in order to solve the
mystery of the flames.

00:06:29.431 --> 00:06:32.851 position:50% align:center
[OBI] Yeah. That's why we
came to steal your research.

00:06:32.934 --> 00:06:35.603 position:50% align:center
I heard that you made
quite the discovery.

Did I hear right?

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:47.532 position:50% align:center
Yeah. And it may help you
to see why I turned devil.

Someone out there is
deliberately creating Infernals.

00:06:51.703 --> 00:06:53.788 position:50% align:center
That said, I'm not
suggesting every

combustion case is murder,

00:06:57.167 --> 00:06:58.710 position:50% align:center
but certain samples I studied

00:06:58.793 --> 00:07:00.587 position:50% align:center
were very different
from the others.

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.422 position:50% align:center
I can explain in detail later.

00:07:02.505 --> 00:07:03.965 position:50% align:center
[OBI] I can't believe
someone out there

00:07:04.049 --> 00:07:06.176 position:50% align:center
is sick enough to do that.

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:08.428 position:50% align:center
Well, they won't
get away with it.

00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:11.181 position:50% align:center
I will hunt them down.

00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:16.102 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA] The nuns, my friends,
all burned to death.

00:07:16.186 --> 00:07:19.773 position:50% align:center
If a human being was
responsible for their pain...

00:07:20.857 --> 00:07:22.650 position:50% align:center
...then I swear by
St. John's wort

00:07:22.734 --> 00:07:24.819 position:50% align:center
and the malice it symbolizes,

00:07:24.903 --> 00:07:28.573 position:50% align:center
I'll do whatever it takes to
find them and burn them alive.

00:07:31.534 --> 00:07:34.037 position:50% align:center
[OBI] Sounds like we're
both after the same mark.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:37.207 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA]
Hpmh. I guess that's true.

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:41.252 position:50% align:center
Of course, this investigation of
yours will only get harder now.

00:07:41.336 --> 00:07:42.962 position:50% align:center
Yeah? How do you mean?

00:07:43.046 --> 00:07:44.756 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA]
The suspected manmade Infernals

00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:46.633 position:50% align:center
all have something in common.

00:07:46.716 --> 00:07:49.636 position:50% align:center
They were first sighted
near Shinjuku ward.

00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:07.904 position:50% align:center

That's a dirty move.

00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:15.954 position:50% align:center

That's kinda nice to hear.

00:08:36.141 --> 00:08:40.478 position:50% align:center

something dangerous, right?

00:08:40.562 --> 00:08:41.980 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:08:42.063 --> 00:08:45.483 position:50% align:center
I'm working with your captain
to investigate Company 1.

00:08:45.567 --> 00:08:48.111 position:50% align:center
There's a chance
it leads to war.

00:08:51.114 --> 00:08:53.324 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA] A surreptitious
investigation of the 1st

using the rookie training

00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:59.080 position:50% align:center
Not bad, Obi. That might work.

00:08:59.164 --> 00:09:01.916 position:50% align:center
Yeah, "The rookie training
reassignment system

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.253 position:50% align:center
enables first-year crew members
to broaden their experience

00:09:05.337 --> 00:09:08.673 position:50% align:center
by getting temporarily assigned
to different companies."

00:09:08.757 --> 00:09:10.717 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna use this to
send the two of you

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.677 position:50% align:center
to Company 1 as spies.

00:09:12.761 --> 00:09:15.305 position:50% align:center
So we're going to
the 1st undercover?

00:09:15.388 --> 00:09:16.806 position:50% align:center
Just me and Arthur?

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:20.143 position:50% align:center
Somebody in their jurisdiction--
perhaps in their company--

00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:22.979 position:50% align:center
has potentially been turning
human beings into Infernals

00:09:23.063 --> 00:09:24.481 position:50% align:center
through artificial means.

00:09:24.564 --> 00:09:26.775 position:50% align:center
Try to come up with
any leads you can.

00:09:26.858 --> 00:09:28.777 position:50% align:center
This could be the key
to cracking the mystery

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:31.821 position:50% align:center
of human combustion,
so be careful.

00:09:31.905 --> 00:09:33.198 position:50% align:center
Best of luck.

00:09:33.281 --> 00:09:34.741 position:50% align:center
I'm on it, Captain.

00:09:34.824 --> 00:09:37.911 position:50% align:center
If someone really is causing
human combustion, they'll pay.

00:09:37.994 --> 00:09:39.496 position:50% align:center
They may begin to
suspect something

00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:41.748 position:50% align:center
if they're only assigned
recruits from the 8th.

00:09:41.831 --> 00:09:44.084 position:50% align:center
I'll send one of
my soldiers, too.

00:09:44.167 --> 00:09:47.045 position:50% align:center
And I'll have a word with
some other companies.

00:09:57.639 --> 00:10:00.058 position:50% align:center
So this is the Holy
Sol Obelisk, huh?

00:10:02.227 --> 00:10:04.270 position:50% align:center
I bet I could climb it.

00:10:07.857 --> 00:10:09.526 position:50% align:center
Pretty lame if you ask me.

00:10:09.609 --> 00:10:11.861 position:50% align:center
Company 1's Grand
Cathedral is so sacred.

00:10:11.945 --> 00:10:13.697 position:50% align:center
I don't feel like I'm worthy.

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:15.073 position:50% align:center
Who're these guys?

00:10:15.156 --> 00:10:16.616 position:50% align:center
They're camouflage, okay?

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:18.952 position:50% align:center
You should try to
make nice with them.

00:10:22.414 --> 00:10:23.957 position:50% align:center
Thank you for your help.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.500 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Uh.

00:10:35.885 --> 00:10:37.053 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Hm?

00:10:37.137 --> 00:10:39.514 position:50% align:center
So you're the newbie-in-
training rookie noobs.

00:10:39.597 --> 00:10:42.559 position:50% align:center
Sheesh. I bet even
your crap is crap.

00:10:42.642 --> 00:10:44.686 position:50% align:center
Are you crappy? You crap?

00:10:44.769 --> 00:10:45.895 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:10:45.979 --> 00:10:47.188 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:10:48.398 --> 00:10:50.233 position:50% align:center
[KARIM]
"I bet even your crap is crap.

00:10:50.316 --> 00:10:52.444 position:50% align:center
Are you crappy? You crap?"

00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:57.198 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] I feel like he's
trying to insult us,

00:10:57.282 --> 00:11:00.952 position:50% align:center
but it sounds like he's
just talkin' about crap.

00:11:01.036 --> 00:11:03.788 position:50% align:center
You bet your ass I know
an ass when I see one.

00:11:03.872 --> 00:11:06.416 position:50% align:center
And your ass is an
ass like any other.

00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:07.417 position:50% align:center
Get me?

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.585 position:50% align:center
What did you say?!

00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:10.086 position:50% align:center
Calm down.

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:12.088 position:50% align:center
He's basically just telling
you that your ass is an ass.

00:11:12.172 --> 00:11:14.132 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:11:14.215 --> 00:11:15.675 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR grunts]

00:11:18.845 --> 00:11:20.930 position:50% align:center
[KARIM] Captain Burns
is expecting you all.

00:11:21.014 --> 00:11:22.390 position:50% align:center
Come with me.

00:11:25.101 --> 00:11:27.270 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Company 1's Captain Burns.

00:11:27.354 --> 00:11:29.939 position:50% align:center
He was at the fire
12 years ago.

00:11:31.691 --> 00:11:33.902 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
He knows something.

00:11:33.985 --> 00:11:36.529 position:50% align:center
He'll be waiting
before the altar.

00:11:36.613 --> 00:11:39.908 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] If someone caused it
on purpose, I need to know.

00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:50.627 position:50% align:center
Company 1 welcomes you.

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:53.797 position:50% align:center
I'm glad you recruits
could join us.

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:56.466 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
And I'm one step closer.

00:12:03.932 --> 00:12:07.227 position:50% align:center
It's bad form, wearing those
uniforms in a church.

00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:09.771 position:50% align:center
Cut 'em some slack.
They didn't know.

00:12:09.854 --> 00:12:12.607 position:50% align:center
I am Maki Oze!
First-Class Fire Soldier.

00:12:12.691 --> 00:12:14.776 position:50% align:center
Here from Company 8.

00:12:14.859 --> 00:12:17.028 position:50% align:center
I've brought the new
recruits in for training!

00:12:17.112 --> 00:12:18.238 position:50% align:center
We're speaking as soldiers,

00:12:18.321 --> 00:12:20.365 position:50% align:center
but we're still in
the Grand Cathedral.

00:12:20.448 --> 00:12:21.950 position:50% align:center
Forgive me for asking,

00:12:22.033 --> 00:12:24.994 position:50% align:center
but I would prefer for you to
tent hands rather than salute.

00:12:25.078 --> 00:12:26.329 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:27.914 --> 00:12:30.250 position:50% align:center
Of course, sir. My apologies.

00:12:31.584 --> 00:12:33.795 position:50% align:center
I'll introduce
Lieutenant Karim Flam,

00:12:33.878 --> 00:12:37.966 position:50% align:center
Lieutenant Rekka Hoshimiya,
and Lieutenant Huo Yan Li.

00:12:38.049 --> 00:12:41.636 position:50% align:center
They'll be looking after you for
the duration of your training.

00:12:42.971 --> 00:12:44.889 position:50% align:center
You're free to look
around the premises.

00:12:44.973 --> 00:12:47.183 position:50% align:center
We want you to feel
at home here.

00:12:47.267 --> 00:12:49.811 position:50% align:center
'Scuse me, Captain Burns,
I know this is sudden...

00:12:49.894 --> 00:12:51.062 position:50% align:center
[BURNS]
Hm?

00:12:52.355 --> 00:12:53.523 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
But I thought I'd ask.

00:12:53.606 --> 00:12:55.900 position:50% align:center
To give you a chance to
assess our abilities,

00:12:55.984 --> 00:12:58.945 position:50% align:center
why don't we start our training
with a quick sparring match?

00:12:59.029 --> 00:13:01.948 position:50% align:center
[MAKI] Wait, Shinra.
Did you really just say that?

00:13:02.032 --> 00:13:03.658 position:50% align:center
We read about all your abilities

00:13:03.742 --> 00:13:05.368 position:50% align:center
in the paperwork
that came with you,

00:13:05.452 --> 00:13:07.162 position:50% align:center
so there's no need for that.

00:13:07.245 --> 00:13:08.538 position:50% align:center
That's all right.

00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:11.207 position:50% align:center
Rekka, help me give
all of 'em a workout.

00:13:11.291 --> 00:13:13.501 position:50% align:center
Huh? Do you mean it?

00:13:13.585 --> 00:13:16.379 position:50% align:center
Calm down. We're in
the Grand Cathedral.

00:13:16.463 --> 00:13:17.630 position:50% align:center
Ahem. Right.

00:13:17.714 --> 00:13:18.715 position:50% align:center
[MAKI] What do you think
you're doing, Shinra?

00:13:18.798 --> 00:13:19.966 position:50% align:center
[KISHIRI]
This is so lame.

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:22.135 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Throwing a light jab.

00:13:22.218 --> 00:13:23.678 position:50% align:center
If I manage to beat you,

00:13:23.762 --> 00:13:26.556 position:50% align:center
there's something I'd
like to ask you about.

00:13:27.682 --> 00:13:29.476 position:50% align:center
That's fine by me.

00:13:37.317 --> 00:13:38.485 position:50% align:center
[OBI groans]

00:13:38.568 --> 00:13:40.862 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Hope those kids are okay.

00:13:42.655 --> 00:13:44.449 position:50% align:center
There's nothing more
you can do to help them,

00:13:44.532 --> 00:13:46.493 position:50% align:center
so there's no point worrying.

00:13:46.576 --> 00:13:47.994 position:50% align:center
Well, be that as it may,

00:13:48.078 --> 00:13:50.789 position:50% align:center
worrying is still a
captain's prerogative.

00:13:50.872 --> 00:13:52.749 position:50% align:center
I can't work like this.

00:13:52.832 --> 00:13:55.460 position:50% align:center
Hey, stop complaining.
Just get back to it.

00:13:55.543 --> 00:13:58.588 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA] Why don't you "get
back" to your post at the 5th?

00:13:58.672 --> 00:14:00.548 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:14:00.632 --> 00:14:02.717 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA] I hope Shinra doesn't
get too full of himself

00:14:02.801 --> 00:14:04.260 position:50% align:center
because he beat me.

00:14:04.344 --> 00:14:07.764 position:50% align:center
That Captain Burns is
a seasoned veteran.

00:14:07.847 --> 00:14:09.224 position:50% align:center
Shinra!

00:14:09.307 --> 00:14:10.975 position:50% align:center
You just got here and
you're already sparring

00:14:11.059 --> 00:14:13.269 position:50% align:center
with Captain Burns?!

00:14:13.353 --> 00:14:14.521 position:50% align:center
It isn't fair!

00:14:14.604 --> 00:14:17.273 position:50% align:center
The captain hasn't even
sparred with me before!

00:14:21.569 --> 00:14:23.154 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI] If that twerp
hurts Lieutenant Rekka,

00:14:23.238 --> 00:14:25.490 position:50% align:center
I'll cave his cocky face in!

00:14:28.284 --> 00:14:29.953 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
I'm gonna do this, damn it!

00:14:30.036 --> 00:14:32.872 position:50% align:center
I'll make him spill
everything he knows!

00:14:32.956 --> 00:14:34.165 position:50% align:center
Is your friend all right?

00:14:34.249 --> 00:14:36.668 position:50% align:center
He seems to be a
little aggravated.

00:14:36.751 --> 00:14:38.837 position:50% align:center
I think he's just so
delighted to be at the 1st

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:40.422 position:50% align:center
that he can't contain himself.

00:14:40.505 --> 00:14:42.424 position:50% align:center
Then he's a
high-spirited crewman!

00:14:42.507 --> 00:14:45.260 position:50% align:center
Sweet! I'm getting all fired up!

00:14:45.343 --> 00:14:47.554 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:14:47.637 --> 00:14:49.472 position:50% align:center
So which of us should go first?

00:14:49.556 --> 00:14:50.932 position:50% align:center
How 'bout we start
with the recruit

00:14:51.016 --> 00:14:52.767 position:50% align:center
from the lowest-numbered
company?

00:14:52.851 --> 00:14:54.519 position:50% align:center
There's no need to hold back.

00:14:54.602 --> 00:14:57.689 position:50% align:center
I want you to put your
full power on display.

00:14:57.772 --> 00:15:00.358 position:50% align:center
[TAKERU]
The lowest-numbered company...

00:15:04.696 --> 00:15:07.657 position:50% align:center
[TAKERU]
Huh?! I have to go first?

00:15:13.496 --> 00:15:16.207 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] Hey, I'm
Lieutenant Hoshimiya.

00:15:16.291 --> 00:15:19.085 position:50% align:center
Seems the two of
us'll be sparring.

00:15:19.169 --> 00:15:21.921 position:50% align:center
[TAKERU] I'm Second-Class
Fire Soldier Takeru Noto.

00:15:22.005 --> 00:15:23.757 position:50% align:center
My family owns a <i>jahgaimo</i> farm,

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:26.134 position:50% align:center
so I started getting
called "Jaga Noto."

00:15:26.217 --> 00:15:28.720 position:50% align:center
And then that turned
into "Juggernaut."

00:15:28.803 --> 00:15:31.181 position:50% align:center
I'm looking forward to
a heated match, okay?

00:15:31.264 --> 00:15:34.059 position:50% align:center
[TAKERU]
No. No fire, please!

00:15:34.142 --> 00:15:36.269 position:50% align:center
Ya think this guy's okay?

00:15:37.896 --> 00:15:39.939 position:50% align:center
[TAKERU]
Oh, no. This is just awful.

00:15:40.023 --> 00:15:41.775 position:50% align:center
Now there's fire coming from me!

00:15:41.858 --> 00:15:44.527 position:50% align:center
Somebody put it out! Please!

00:15:44.611 --> 00:15:46.404 position:50% align:center
That's what I like
to see, buddy!

00:15:46.488 --> 00:15:48.698 position:50% align:center
Those flames symbolize
your burning passion!

00:15:48.782 --> 00:15:50.283 position:50% align:center
[TAKERU]
That is not what this is!

00:15:50.367 --> 00:15:51.951 position:50% align:center
I'm just scared! Really scared!

00:15:52.035 --> 00:15:54.204 position:50% align:center
Ah! It's so hot!

00:15:54.287 --> 00:15:56.331 position:50% align:center
You and I like it
hot, Juggernaut.

00:15:56.414 --> 00:16:00.293 position:50% align:center
Keep on pushin'. Lemme see
the best flames you've got!

00:16:00.377 --> 00:16:02.629 position:50% align:center
[BURNS] That enthusiasm's
always set to broil.

00:16:02.712 --> 00:16:04.422 position:50% align:center
[LI]
Yeah. I'm a little worried.

00:16:04.506 --> 00:16:06.257 position:50% align:center
[KARIM]
I'll deal with any stray shots.

00:16:06.341 --> 00:16:07.592 position:50% align:center
[LI]
See that you do.

00:16:07.676 --> 00:16:09.010 position:50% align:center
Good grief.

00:16:09.094 --> 00:16:12.263 position:50% align:center
This nuisance really is an
annoying thorn in my side.

00:16:12.347 --> 00:16:13.348 position:50% align:center
I'm simmering!

00:16:13.431 --> 00:16:14.974 position:50% align:center
Oh, man, the Special Fire Force

00:16:15.058 --> 00:16:17.102 position:50% align:center
has been waiting for talent
like yours, ya know?

00:16:17.185 --> 00:16:18.436 position:50% align:center
[TAKERU]
Don't talk like that!

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:20.188 position:50% align:center
You're gonna get me stirred up.

00:16:20.271 --> 00:16:21.481 position:50% align:center
I'm scared of fire!

00:16:21.564 --> 00:16:22.774 position:50% align:center
I joined the Special Fire Force

00:16:22.857 --> 00:16:25.402 position:50% align:center
because I wanted to get
my flames put out!

00:16:25.485 --> 00:16:27.987 position:50% align:center
But you guys just
keep fanning them!

00:16:28.071 --> 00:16:29.989 position:50% align:center
The heat you're puttin'
out is incredible!

00:16:30.073 --> 00:16:33.868 position:50% align:center
Every last shot has the
force of a juggernaut!

00:16:33.952 --> 00:16:35.495 position:50% align:center
Lieutenant Rekka!

00:16:35.578 --> 00:16:37.455 position:50% align:center
[REKKA]
Nice one! Keep it up!

00:16:37.539 --> 00:16:38.289 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:16:38.373 --> 00:16:39.791 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:16:39.874 --> 00:16:41.001 position:50% align:center
[REKKA yells]

00:16:41.084 --> 00:16:43.795 position:50% align:center
Ya dodged 'em all,
ya lazy slacker sloth.

00:16:43.878 --> 00:16:45.005 position:50% align:center
It's all good,

00:16:45.088 --> 00:16:47.007 position:50% align:center
'cause I've got you
backin' me up, Karim!

00:16:50.969 --> 00:16:51.428 position:50% align:center
What the--?

00:16:51.511 --> 00:16:53.221 position:50% align:center
He stopped them.

00:16:55.473 --> 00:16:58.518 position:50% align:center
But that much energy can't
have just been erased.

00:17:07.861 --> 00:17:10.113 position:50% align:center
So he froze all that flame?

00:17:12.157 --> 00:17:14.409 position:50% align:center
Damn it, Rekka!

00:17:14.492 --> 00:17:16.036 position:50% align:center
That might'a burned
the captain's uniform

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:17.579 position:50% align:center
if I hadn't been here!

00:17:17.662 --> 00:17:21.041 position:50% align:center
[REKKA] But you were here!
And I totally believe in you!

00:17:23.084 --> 00:17:24.627 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:17:27.088 --> 00:17:28.965 position:50% align:center
Does the 1st really
have a Fire Soldier

00:17:29.049 --> 00:17:31.176 position:50% align:center
who conjures frost
instead of flame?

00:17:31.259 --> 00:17:32.260 position:50% align:center
[KARIM]
Hm?

00:17:32.344 --> 00:17:34.346 position:50% align:center
I'm just a regular
second-generation.

00:17:34.429 --> 00:17:37.057 position:50% align:center
You really think I have
some kinda frost powers?

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:39.184 position:50% align:center
Then where'd that ice come from?

00:17:39.267 --> 00:17:41.561 position:50% align:center
It's called Thermo-
Acoustic Cooling.

00:17:41.644 --> 00:17:42.854 position:50% align:center
It's a technique that allows me

00:17:42.937 --> 00:17:45.231 position:50% align:center
to convert the heat energy
of flame into sound

00:17:45.315 --> 00:17:48.610 position:50% align:center
by compressing it
in a specific way.

00:17:48.693 --> 00:17:52.322 position:50% align:center
As that sound abrades the air,
it's converted into cold.

00:17:52.405 --> 00:17:54.115 position:50% align:center
So you can take a fire's heat

00:17:54.199 --> 00:17:56.659 position:50% align:center
and convert it into
sound to freeze it over?

00:17:56.743 --> 00:17:59.329 position:50% align:center
I didn't even realize
that was possible!

00:17:59.412 --> 00:18:00.622 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
Huh?

00:18:08.213 --> 00:18:10.465 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Someone in or near the 1st

00:18:10.548 --> 00:18:13.718 position:50% align:center
is artificially turning
people Infernal.

00:18:13.802 --> 00:18:16.971 position:50% align:center
The culprit could be
one of these guys.

00:18:17.055 --> 00:18:20.266 position:50% align:center
Or it could be all three.

00:18:25.689 --> 00:18:27.732 position:50% align:center
Let's start the next.

00:18:27.816 --> 00:18:30.235 position:50% align:center
I only fight when I see
an essential purpose.

00:18:30.318 --> 00:18:31.653 position:50% align:center
You'll have to excuse me.

00:18:31.736 --> 00:18:33.029 position:50% align:center
Yeah, so, uh,

00:18:33.113 --> 00:18:35.115 position:50% align:center
I can only do the stuff
on my paperwork,

00:18:35.198 --> 00:18:37.951 position:50% align:center
which means you should know what
I can do without me fighting.

00:18:38.034 --> 00:18:39.869 position:50% align:center
That okay?

00:18:39.953 --> 00:18:41.955 position:50% align:center
That leaves Company 8.

00:18:43.498 --> 00:18:46.960 position:50% align:center
You two fight as a team.
I'll take on both o' ya.

00:18:48.086 --> 00:18:51.214 position:50% align:center
Why would the captain agree
to waste his time on them?

00:19:06.646 --> 00:19:08.231 position:50% align:center
Bring it on.

00:19:11.151 --> 00:19:13.486 position:50% align:center
Chivalry dictates that
we take turns,

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:16.448 position:50% align:center
and since I'm gonna beat
him, you won't get one.

00:19:16.531 --> 00:19:17.866 position:50% align:center
Have at thee.

00:19:17.949 --> 00:19:20.285 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR yells]

00:19:24.581 --> 00:19:27.208 position:50% align:center
What are you planning
to do with that hand?

00:19:31.296 --> 00:19:33.089 position:50% align:center
Fight me with all you have.

00:19:33.173 --> 00:19:35.675 position:50% align:center
If you don't, this match
will be completely devoid

00:19:35.759 --> 00:19:37.802 position:50% align:center
of any meaning.

00:19:37.886 --> 00:19:40.430 position:50% align:center
Fine, but don't blame
me if you lose an arm.

00:19:40.513 --> 00:19:43.933 position:50% align:center
You would need to wield a hotter
flame than that one to cut me.

00:19:44.017 --> 00:19:45.727 position:50% align:center
Set your mind at ease.

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:47.771 position:50% align:center
"A hotter flame than that"?

00:19:47.854 --> 00:19:49.731 position:50% align:center
What's hotter than
Arthur's Excalibur?

00:19:49.814 --> 00:19:52.984 position:50% align:center
He can even use that blade
to cut through steel.

00:19:55.737 --> 00:19:58.239 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
At least I warned you!

00:19:58.323 --> 00:19:59.491 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:04.204 --> 00:20:06.373 position:50% align:center
Your sword kills
with one strike,

00:20:06.456 --> 00:20:08.500 position:50% align:center
but what if it should fail you?

00:20:14.547 --> 00:20:19.302 position:50% align:center
No way. Not even the ogress
could extinguish Excalibur.

00:20:19.386 --> 00:20:23.014 position:50% align:center
What are you waiting for?
Don't ease up on him now!

00:20:27.936 --> 00:20:31.481 position:50% align:center
That crewman packs some
impressive firepower, too.

00:20:43.785 --> 00:20:45.912 position:50% align:center
Step back or you'll be killed.

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:57.090 position:50% align:center
Unreal.

00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:02.262 position:50% align:center
A question for you:
Why join the Fire Force?

00:21:02.345 --> 00:21:04.973 position:50% align:center
I lost both my mom and
my brother in a fire.

00:21:05.056 --> 00:21:07.851 position:50% align:center
I joined the Force to solve the
mystery of human combustion

00:21:07.934 --> 00:21:10.353 position:50% align:center
and make fires like that
a thing of the past.

00:21:10.437 --> 00:21:12.647 position:50% align:center
To become a hero who
can save the world

00:21:12.731 --> 00:21:15.191 position:50% align:center
from the terror of the flames!

00:21:15.275 --> 00:21:17.986 position:50% align:center
You still have a long way to go.

00:21:29.664 --> 00:21:32.792 position:50% align:center
Let me bid each of you
welcome to Company 1.

00:21:32.876 --> 00:21:34.878 position:50% align:center
You'll be here but
for a short time.

00:21:34.961 --> 00:21:37.547 position:50% align:center
I suggest you work hard
and make the most of it.

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:39.257 position:50% align:center
Are you hurt, Captain?

00:21:39.341 --> 00:21:40.884 position:50% align:center
That was amazing!

00:21:40.967 --> 00:21:41.468 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI grunts]

00:21:41.551 --> 00:21:43.928 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:21:44.012 --> 00:21:45.347 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
Ah?!

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:47.098 position:50% align:center
Ah...

00:21:47.182 --> 00:21:48.725 position:50% align:center
Gotcha.

00:21:48.808 --> 00:21:52.103 position:50% align:center
Your Lucky Lecher Lure is
no match for my reflexes.

00:21:52.187 --> 00:21:53.313 position:50% align:center
We're good.

00:21:53.396 --> 00:21:55.774 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Lieutenant Rekka.

00:21:55.857 --> 00:21:58.985 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry! You
always have to help me!

00:22:00.779 --> 00:22:03.156 position:50% align:center
[footsteps]

00:22:03.239 --> 00:22:05.867 position:50% align:center
You Company 8
guys'll train under me.

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:08.620 position:50% align:center
You two never had a chance
against Captain Burns.

00:22:08.703 --> 00:22:11.456 position:50% align:center
But you still did all right,
in a fairly decent way.

00:22:11.539 --> 00:22:12.582 position:50% align:center
Of course we did.

00:22:12.665 --> 00:22:14.501 position:50% align:center
Thank you for saying so, sir.

00:22:14.584 --> 00:22:16.920 position:50% align:center
But whether your pace keeps
you apace of our pace,

00:22:17.003 --> 00:22:19.839 position:50% align:center
or whether your pace gets
outpaced by our pace,

00:22:19.923 --> 00:22:22.884 position:50% align:center
just try to hang in there, okay?

00:22:24.177 --> 00:22:26.471 position:50% align:center
Thank you very much, sir!

00:22:26.554 --> 00:22:27.764 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
Huh?
