00:00:12.262 --> 00:00:14.723 position:50% align:center
[OBI] Causes of death
are many and varied.

00:00:14.806 --> 00:00:18.184 position:50% align:center
Old age. Illness. Suicide.

00:00:18.268 --> 00:00:19.978 position:50% align:center
But out of that long,
morbid list,

00:00:20.061 --> 00:00:23.690 position:50% align:center
there's one end that people
fear above all others...

00:00:26.818 --> 00:00:28.820 position:50% align:center line:10%
[OBI]
Death by fire.

00:00:42.667 --> 00:00:44.461 position:50% align:center
Anybody home?

00:00:48.631 --> 00:00:50.216 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] This'll be a good
chance for me to see

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.511 position:50% align:center
how far I can go against
a company captain.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.641 position:50% align:center
That said, I've got no chance

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:00.727 position:50% align:center
if I can't deal with
that weird power.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.062 position:50% align:center
It ends for you here.

00:01:02.145 --> 00:01:03.146 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Huh?

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:05.607 position:50% align:center
[ANGELS]
'Cause the 5th Angels Three...

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.692 position:50% align:center
...have come for thee!

00:02:51.588 --> 00:02:56.593 position:50% align:center
[NUNS groaning]

00:03:07.645 --> 00:03:09.064 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA]
All right, Iris.

00:03:09.147 --> 00:03:13.651 position:50% align:center
Be a good girl and watch your
allies from the 8th burn.

00:03:13.735 --> 00:03:15.153 position:50% align:center
[IRIS]
Why are you doing this?

00:03:15.236 --> 00:03:17.238 position:50% align:center
Maybe you should ask
that god of salvation

00:03:17.322 --> 00:03:18.698 position:50% align:center
you're still pledged to.

00:03:18.782 --> 00:03:21.284 position:50% align:center
There are just two ways
you can live in this world.

00:03:21.368 --> 00:03:24.954 position:50% align:center
You can burn others
or you can be burnt.

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:26.748 position:50% align:center
Think of all our Sisters.

00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:30.835 position:50% align:center
The way their bodies shriveled
as the flames consumed them.

00:03:32.087 --> 00:03:37.092 position:50% align:center
[NUNS groaning]

00:03:44.391 --> 00:03:47.977 position:50% align:center
It certainly is lucky that I'm
a third-generation pyrokinetic.

00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:50.271 position:50% align:center
I'll never be consumed
by cruel flames

00:03:50.355 --> 00:03:52.816 position:50% align:center
because I decided to
become like them instead.

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:55.652 position:50% align:center
I'll give purpose to the
worthless gravel beneath me

00:03:55.735 --> 00:03:58.405 position:50% align:center
by burning it to fuel
my rise to the top.

00:03:58.488 --> 00:04:00.949 position:50% align:center
Because that's what
true happiness is.

00:04:01.032 --> 00:04:02.534 position:50% align:center
Whatever you gain
from living like that

00:04:02.617 --> 00:04:04.202 position:50% align:center
could never be called happiness!

00:04:04.285 --> 00:04:06.496 position:50% align:center
Spout those empty
platitudes all you want.

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:10.083 position:50% align:center
You're just waiting
to burn. Ignorant fool!

00:04:10.166 --> 00:04:11.710 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Get away from the Sister.

00:04:11.793 --> 00:04:13.003 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:15.046 --> 00:04:17.507 position:50% align:center
You've got a hero to fight.

00:04:18.466 --> 00:04:20.427 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA] He'll be the first
of your friends I burn.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:21.886 position:50% align:center
Sit tight and watch.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.430 position:50% align:center
You have to run, Shinra!

00:04:23.513 --> 00:04:27.058 position:50% align:center
As strong as you are, you still
can't defeat Captain Hibana!

00:04:28.018 --> 00:04:30.520 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
It's all right. I'll be fine.

00:04:32.188 --> 00:04:34.816 position:50% align:center
This won't go like it
did the last time.

00:04:34.899 --> 00:04:36.067 position:50% align:center
You fool.

00:04:36.151 --> 00:04:38.153 position:50% align:center
It seems you have
a short memory.

00:04:38.236 --> 00:04:39.571 position:50% align:center
A hunk of gravel like you

00:04:39.654 --> 00:04:41.823 position:50% align:center
doesn't stand a chance
of harming me.

00:04:41.906 --> 00:04:44.576 position:50% align:center
There's no way to
know until I try.

00:04:49.581 --> 00:04:50.999 position:50% align:center
Shinra, no!

00:04:51.082 --> 00:04:55.545 position:50% align:center
You really must be gravel.
So eager to lie beneath my feet.

00:04:56.504 --> 00:04:58.548 position:50% align:center
My head's spinning. Damn.

00:04:58.631 --> 00:05:01.343 position:50% align:center
Ah!

00:05:01.426 --> 00:05:04.095 position:50% align:center
What have you... done to me?

00:05:04.179 --> 00:05:05.889 position:50% align:center
It's called heat syncope.

00:05:05.972 --> 00:05:08.350 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
What's that mean?

00:05:08.433 --> 00:05:09.184 position:50% align:center
Simple.

00:05:09.267 --> 00:05:10.560 position:50% align:center
Your body has been enveloped

00:05:10.643 --> 00:05:13.396 position:50% align:center
by a miniature heatwave
created by me.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.731 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Huh?

00:05:14.814 --> 00:05:16.775 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA] This causes your
blood vessels to dilate

00:05:16.858 --> 00:05:18.360 position:50% align:center
and your blood pressure to drop,

00:05:18.443 --> 00:05:21.237 position:50% align:center
which means less blood
flow to your poor brain.

00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:24.407 position:50% align:center
And that causes vertigo.

00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:27.410 position:50% align:center
After storming in here and
dubbing yourself a hero,

00:05:27.494 --> 00:05:30.330 position:50% align:center
you ended up getting taken
out by a bit of heat.

00:05:30.413 --> 00:05:32.374 position:50% align:center
It's quite amusing.

00:05:37.504 --> 00:05:39.506 position:50% align:center
Vertigo?

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:41.883 position:50% align:center
That's all it is?

00:05:41.966 --> 00:05:46.388 position:50% align:center
I see now. You're sayin' this
is all in my head, right?

00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:47.681 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA]
Huh?

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.227 position:50% align:center
What do you mean,
"all in your head"?

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.980 position:50% align:center
Look at yourself,
you can barely even stand.

00:05:56.064 --> 00:05:58.191 position:50% align:center
I feel short of breath,
dizzy, and weak,

00:05:58.274 --> 00:06:00.819 position:50% align:center
but now I realize
it's only a delusion.

00:06:00.902 --> 00:06:03.780 position:50% align:center
Looks like you're just
trying to grin and bear it.

00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:06.116 position:50% align:center
But if you'd like to talk
about yourself and delusions,

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:08.034 position:50% align:center
why don't we start with
the ridiculous idea

00:06:08.118 --> 00:06:09.744 position:50% align:center
that you're a hero?

00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:16.668 position:50% align:center
Let's think this over.

00:06:16.751 --> 00:06:19.838 position:50% align:center
I'm dizzy in my head,
so I'm dizzy for real.

00:06:19.921 --> 00:06:23.633 position:50% align:center
Well, hey, guess what?
I'm a hero in my head, too!

00:06:24.592 --> 00:06:25.844 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA]
This is absurd.

00:06:25.927 --> 00:06:27.846 position:50% align:center
How are you even standing?

00:06:27.929 --> 00:06:28.847 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Compared to the drills

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.682 position:50% align:center
Lieutenant Hinawa
put me through,

00:06:30.765 --> 00:06:32.934 position:50% align:center
this is a stroll
through the park.

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:37.272 position:50% align:center
Fine, then.

00:06:37.355 --> 00:06:39.566 position:50% align:center
There's no sport in burning a
man who can't defend himself.

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:41.693 position:50% align:center
Come forth, Clematis.

00:06:42.777 --> 00:06:45.697 position:50% align:center
I shall grant you a beautiful
death by my flowers.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.907 position:50% align:center
Sister, after all
this time, you--

00:06:47.991 --> 00:06:49.826 position:50% align:center
Just shut your mouth and watch.

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:51.578 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:51.661 --> 00:06:52.871 position:50% align:center
But--

00:06:57.792 --> 00:06:59.044 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
I might be wrong,

00:06:59.127 --> 00:07:02.172 position:50% align:center
but I think you're the
who's delusional, Princess.

00:07:02.255 --> 00:07:03.715 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA]
Say what?

00:07:03.798 --> 00:07:07.135 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Don't worry.
It's your lucky day.

00:07:08.178 --> 00:07:11.681 position:50% align:center
'Cause Smack-that-Princess-to-
Her-Senses-Man is here for ya!

00:07:11.765 --> 00:07:14.559 position:50% align:center
And what delusion are you
planning to save me from?

00:07:14.642 --> 00:07:18.438 position:50% align:center
Not sure, but you look
like you're in pain.

00:07:20.398 --> 00:07:22.567 position:50% align:center
You know nothing about me!

00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:29.157 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:07:41.002 --> 00:07:43.546 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA] So your dizziness
is all in your head, is it?

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:45.507 position:50% align:center
I think we'd find that
a lot more convincing

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:48.510 position:50% align:center
if you'd stop falling
all over yourself!

00:07:51.638 --> 00:07:52.806 position:50% align:center
Damn it!

00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:54.891 position:50% align:center
Honestly, how can you
call yourself a hero?

00:07:54.974 --> 00:07:56.976 position:50% align:center
If you must close
your eyes to reality,

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.938 position:50% align:center
then I guess I'll have
to burn off your eyelids.

00:08:07.737 --> 00:08:09.197 position:50% align:center
Sakura!

00:08:27.674 --> 00:08:29.217 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA] That's a funny
dance you're doing.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:30.969 position:50% align:center
Don't you enjoy
the flower petals?

00:08:31.052 --> 00:08:32.887 position:50% align:center
Sister, you have to stop this!

00:08:32.971 --> 00:08:34.931 position:50% align:center
You could ask your
God to make me stop.

00:08:35.015 --> 00:08:36.349 position:50% align:center
Oh, wait.

00:08:36.433 --> 00:08:39.144 position:50% align:center
Could it be that you've
realized your God isn't real?

00:08:39.227 --> 00:08:41.813 position:50% align:center
And for the record,
neither are heroes.

00:08:41.896 --> 00:08:43.565 position:50% align:center
No, that isn't true.

00:08:43.648 --> 00:08:47.110 position:50% align:center
If you pray with all your heart,
you can find real comfort.

00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:49.070 position:50% align:center
There are people who
have been saved by it!

00:08:49.154 --> 00:08:51.906 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA] You know damn well
that isn't real salvation.

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:53.616 position:50% align:center
[IRIS]
Then are you saying that there's

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.326 position:50% align:center
no such thing as salvation?

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:57.495 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA]
Sure there is.

00:08:57.579 --> 00:09:00.290 position:50% align:center
You outsmart others and exploit
them to your own ends

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:02.542 position:50% align:center
until you've risen so high
that when you look down

00:09:02.625 --> 00:09:06.671 position:50% align:center
at the foolish masses below,
you see nothing but gravel.

00:09:06.755 --> 00:09:09.924 position:50% align:center
Gravel. Impotent gravel.

00:09:10.008 --> 00:09:12.093 position:50% align:center
And then, safe in the knowledge

00:09:12.177 --> 00:09:15.513 position:50% align:center
that you're better than
the riff-raff, you smile.

00:09:15.597 --> 00:09:17.432 position:50% align:center
The only salvation
I need comes from

00:09:17.515 --> 00:09:19.851 position:50% align:center
the wealth and status
I gain with power.

00:09:19.934 --> 00:09:21.394 position:50% align:center
How so?

00:09:21.478 --> 00:09:24.314 position:50% align:center
You prayed with us every day
back at the convent, remember?

00:09:24.397 --> 00:09:28.234 position:50% align:center
All of us prayed. And what
did we get as our reward?

00:09:28.318 --> 00:09:34.115 position:50% align:center
[bell tolling]

00:09:34.199 --> 00:09:37.702 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA] The convent was
a refuge for us orphans.

00:09:42.374 --> 00:09:45.835 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA] We were taught to
devote ourselves to God.

00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:50.382 position:50% align:center
I was probably the only one who
didn't take it all seriously.

00:09:50.465 --> 00:09:53.593 position:50% align:center
And then, that day...

00:09:53.677 --> 00:09:58.098 position:50% align:center
[NUNS groaning]

00:09:58.181 --> 00:10:01.017 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA] The other Sisters
started burning away.

00:10:01.101 --> 00:10:05.855 position:50% align:center
Every last one of them,
except you and me.

00:10:05.939 --> 00:10:07.357 position:50% align:center
They were all devout nuns,

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:11.111 position:50% align:center
who served God far better
than I ever cared to.

00:10:11.194 --> 00:10:16.116 position:50% align:center
Don't you see? Kind-hearted
devotion never pays.

00:10:16.199 --> 00:10:19.327 position:50% align:center
The fact that I'm still alive
while those nuns are dead

00:10:19.411 --> 00:10:22.497 position:50% align:center
proves that more than anything.

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:25.542 position:50% align:center
You can only get stronger
by pursuing selfish gain.

00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:27.335 position:50% align:center
And if you're hoping
to find salvation

00:10:27.419 --> 00:10:28.878 position:50% align:center
without getting stronger,

00:10:28.962 --> 00:10:31.881 position:50% align:center
why, you may as well
ask God for the moon.

00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:36.136 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA] Salvation is
reserved for humans.

00:10:36.219 --> 00:10:39.514 position:50% align:center
So by what right does
gravel hope to claim it?

00:10:41.641 --> 00:10:43.226 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Princess Hibana.

00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:46.354 position:50% align:center
You're a victim of
the flames, too, right?

00:10:46.438 --> 00:10:49.983 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA] Our cardboard
hero, standing again.

00:10:51.443 --> 00:10:55.405 position:50% align:center
I know how you feel,
at least a little bit.

00:10:55.488 --> 00:10:59.659 position:50% align:center
All the sweetest things in my
life went up in flames as well.

00:10:59.743 --> 00:11:02.454 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA]
You'll never know how I feel.

00:11:03.913 --> 00:11:06.166 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA]
Sakura Blizzard.

00:11:09.419 --> 00:11:13.006 position:50% align:center
[screaming]

00:11:13.089 --> 00:11:16.926 position:50% align:center
This time, I'll make you stay
down like the gravel you are!

00:11:25.894 --> 00:11:28.396 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
You will never keep me down.

00:11:30.023 --> 00:11:32.359 position:50% align:center
But the heat syncope.

00:11:32.442 --> 00:11:34.736 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] I'll get up
as often as it takes.

00:11:34.819 --> 00:11:37.197 position:50% align:center
Convinced I can win every time.

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.199 position:50% align:center
'Cause I have to help you.

00:11:41.201 --> 00:11:43.286 position:50% align:center
Huh? Have you lost your mind?

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:44.746 position:50% align:center
What're you talking about?

00:11:44.829 --> 00:11:47.832 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Listen,
I'm about to lay you out.

00:11:47.916 --> 00:11:51.461 position:50% align:center
And that, along with
the rest of this...

00:11:51.544 --> 00:11:53.296 position:50% align:center
...is for your own good!

00:11:56.591 --> 00:11:58.426 position:50% align:center
Well, if all you want
is what's best for me,

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:00.428 position:50% align:center
then go ahead and burn already!

00:12:00.512 --> 00:12:03.181 position:50% align:center
Lie down and let the flames
do what they do best!

00:12:03.264 --> 00:12:06.351 position:50% align:center
Fire does more than burn people.

00:12:06.434 --> 00:12:08.144 position:50% align:center
It offers us warmth
when we're freezing,

00:12:08.228 --> 00:12:10.730 position:50% align:center
and when we're surrounded by
darkness, it lights the way.

00:12:10.814 --> 00:12:14.818 position:50% align:center
There's no such thing as a
hero in this wretched world!

00:12:14.901 --> 00:12:17.654 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] It might be true
that there aren't any yet...

00:12:19.155 --> 00:12:22.492 position:50% align:center
...but that's all the more
reason for me to become one!

00:12:23.702 --> 00:12:25.370 position:50% align:center
You're gonna be okay.

00:12:25.453 --> 00:12:31.543 position:50% align:center
Or else my name isn't... Smack-
that-Princess-to-Her-Senses Man!

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:48.143 position:50% align:center
[NUNS gasping, chattering]

00:12:48.226 --> 00:12:50.020 position:50% align:center
[SISTER A]
Look at that one!

00:12:53.314 --> 00:12:55.316 position:50% align:center
Wow, all of them are so pretty.

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.694 position:50% align:center
That's really amazing,
Sister Hibana.

00:12:57.777 --> 00:12:59.654 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA]
Heh! Thanks, Sister Clematis.

00:12:59.738 --> 00:13:00.405 position:50% align:center
Look here.

00:13:00.488 --> 00:13:02.574 position:50% align:center
[NUNS gasp]

00:13:02.657 --> 00:13:05.660 position:50% align:center
If I put a droplet of sodium
solution onto one of them,

00:13:05.744 --> 00:13:06.911 position:50% align:center
the flame will react.

00:13:06.995 --> 00:13:08.121 position:50% align:center
Watch.

00:13:11.499 --> 00:13:13.960 position:50% align:center
Wow. It looks so cool!

00:13:14.044 --> 00:13:15.920 position:50% align:center
This one is copper.

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:24.679 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA] Sister Sakura,
this one's for you.

00:13:24.763 --> 00:13:26.765 position:50% align:center
It's calcium this time.

00:13:30.977 --> 00:13:34.689 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA] I also have potassium,
strontium, and a few others.

00:13:39.027 --> 00:13:41.696 position:50% align:center
They're all so
wonderful to look at.

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:45.658 position:50% align:center
I know. Flames are incredibly
beautiful, don't you think?

00:13:45.742 --> 00:13:47.202 position:50% align:center
[SISTER CLEMATIS]
Uh-huh!

00:13:47.285 --> 00:13:49.621 position:50% align:center
[SISTER SAKURA] Sister Hibana,
I wanna be like you someday.

00:13:49.704 --> 00:13:53.124 position:50% align:center
You can make fire, plus
you're good at science stuff.

00:13:56.378 --> 00:13:57.837 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:05.512 position:50% align:center
Hello, Iris!

00:14:05.595 --> 00:14:09.307 position:50% align:center
Don't hide behind the corner.
Come out and have a closer look.

00:14:15.897 --> 00:14:17.774 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:22.362 --> 00:14:24.114 position:50% align:center
--Oh, uh.
--Careful.

00:14:24.197 --> 00:14:25.824 position:50% align:center
They might be in
the shape of flowers,

00:14:25.907 --> 00:14:27.701 position:50% align:center
but each is a burning flame.

00:14:27.784 --> 00:14:29.411 position:50% align:center
They can hurt you.

00:14:31.913 --> 00:14:33.248 position:50% align:center
[SISTER SUMIRE]
My goodness!

00:14:33.331 --> 00:14:35.208 position:50% align:center
What's going on here,
Sister Hibana?

00:14:35.291 --> 00:14:38.294 position:50% align:center
Are you playing with
your fire again?

00:14:38.378 --> 00:14:42.048 position:50% align:center
Come along now, everyone.
Back to the chapel, all right?

00:14:42.132 --> 00:14:46.344 position:50% align:center
[NUNS]
Okay. Thank you, Sister Sumire.

00:14:46.428 --> 00:14:48.471 position:50% align:center
[SISTER SUMIRE]
As for you, Sister Hibana.

00:14:48.555 --> 00:14:50.473 position:50% align:center
Your power is a gift
from the great Sol--

00:14:50.557 --> 00:14:52.434 position:50% align:center
it's not meant
to be played with.

00:14:52.517 --> 00:14:55.311 position:50% align:center
What's more, if you were to
wield these flames carelessly,

00:14:55.395 --> 00:14:57.230 position:50% align:center
they could become
very dangerous.

00:14:57.313 --> 00:14:58.648 position:50% align:center
But I'm being very
careful with them,

00:14:58.732 --> 00:15:00.191 position:50% align:center
so it shouldn't be an issue.

00:15:00.275 --> 00:15:03.111 position:50% align:center
[SISTER SUMIRE] And there
you go, arguing again.

00:15:03.194 --> 00:15:05.905 position:50% align:center
Back to the chapel with you.

00:15:05.989 --> 00:15:07.782 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA]
Fine.

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:18.793 position:50% align:center
Sorry.

00:15:18.877 --> 00:15:23.798 position:50% align:center
But, Sister Hibana? I, um...

00:15:23.882 --> 00:15:25.800 position:50% align:center
You okay?

00:15:25.884 --> 00:15:29.596 position:50% align:center
[IRIS]
It's just-- Well, uh.

00:15:33.975 --> 00:15:39.314 position:50% align:center
I'd, um... I'd like to see
those flowers again.

00:15:39.397 --> 00:15:40.899 position:50% align:center
Pretty please.

00:15:46.112 --> 00:15:49.574 position:50% align:center
Sure, I'll show them to you once
you get over your shyness, okay?

00:15:51.618 --> 00:15:53.995 position:50% align:center
Wait, do you really mean it?

00:16:04.589 --> 00:16:07.300 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA]
The smell of burning bodies.

00:16:07.384 --> 00:16:10.470 position:50% align:center
The inhuman screams
of the dying.

00:16:10.553 --> 00:16:16.142 position:50% align:center
Searing pain. Anguish.
Lives crumbling to ash.

00:16:16.226 --> 00:16:19.270 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA] Flames are incredibly
beautiful, don't you think?

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:28.530 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA] As if something like
fire could ever be pretty.

00:16:33.868 --> 00:16:35.120 position:50% align:center
Let's go.

00:16:35.203 --> 00:16:39.624 position:50% align:center
If we don't, then we'll
only burn up beside them.

00:16:53.555 --> 00:16:57.350 position:50% align:center
As if a power like mine
could've come from God.

00:16:57.434 --> 00:17:01.563 position:50% align:center
Fire comes from hell itself,
so if I wield it,

00:17:01.646 --> 00:17:03.982 position:50% align:center
I know what that makes me.

00:17:04.065 --> 00:17:07.152 position:50% align:center
And a devil should
act like a devil.

00:17:08.236 --> 00:17:10.321 position:50% align:center
[IRIS]
Hey, wait.

00:17:10.405 --> 00:17:12.824 position:50% align:center
Where are you going, Sister?

00:17:14.784 --> 00:17:16.161 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA]
Away.

00:17:19.539 --> 00:17:22.542 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA] Don't let
yourself be burnt, Iris.

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:29.507 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA]
People. Flames.

00:17:29.591 --> 00:17:32.427 position:50% align:center
Whatever I find, I'll exploit.

00:17:37.223 --> 00:17:39.642 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA] That's just a
taste of my findings.

00:17:39.726 --> 00:17:42.729 position:50% align:center
Meet my conditions
and you get the rest.

00:17:42.812 --> 00:17:44.773 position:50% align:center
First, I want the
rank of captain.

00:17:44.856 --> 00:17:46.691 position:50% align:center
Furthermore, I want
funding and a lab

00:17:46.775 --> 00:17:49.736 position:50% align:center
from which I can carry
on my experiments.

00:18:00.747 --> 00:18:02.707 position:50% align:center
Why do all this?

00:18:04.376 --> 00:18:07.545 position:50% align:center
We children at the convent
didn't have any parents.

00:18:07.629 --> 00:18:09.839 position:50% align:center
But we did have our big sister.

00:18:09.923 --> 00:18:14.719 position:50% align:center
She was beautiful and clever,
and she had mastered fire.

00:18:14.803 --> 00:18:17.472 position:50% align:center
And when I was lonely
but too scared to speak,

00:18:17.555 --> 00:18:19.766 position:50% align:center
my hero called to me.

00:18:23.478 --> 00:18:26.106 position:50% align:center
I didn't have anyone
like that, though.

00:18:26.189 --> 00:18:29.442 position:50% align:center
All I had to prop myself
up were my flames,

00:18:29.526 --> 00:18:32.737 position:50% align:center
and then I found out they
couldn't be trusted, either.

00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:45.417 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA]
I don't have anything left now.

00:18:53.133 --> 00:18:56.011 position:50% align:center
If ya want a hero,
there's one right here.

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:01.433 position:50% align:center
Just look to the skies
and cry out my name!

00:19:01.516 --> 00:19:04.102 position:50% align:center
I'll come and save you anytime!

00:19:06.396 --> 00:19:07.939 position:50% align:center
But that's ridiculous.

00:19:08.023 --> 00:19:09.858 position:50% align:center
You're under no obligation
to help me at all,

00:19:09.941 --> 00:19:12.360 position:50% align:center
especially not after
what I've done.

00:19:12.444 --> 00:19:15.030 position:50% align:center
But I don't have to be obliged.

00:19:15.113 --> 00:19:17.574 position:50% align:center
If you say you need me,
I come running.

00:19:17.657 --> 00:19:19.784 position:50% align:center
'Cause that's what heroes do.

00:19:26.791 --> 00:19:28.835 position:50% align:center
Whatever the case,
you defeated me.

00:19:28.918 --> 00:19:32.005 position:50% align:center
So I don't intend to
fight you any longer.

00:19:32.088 --> 00:19:34.174 position:50% align:center
[IRIS]
Mh-hm. Mh-hm.

00:19:38.011 --> 00:19:41.973 position:50% align:center
What do you think? Did I
overcome my shyness a bit?

00:19:43.391 --> 00:19:45.935 position:50% align:center
How is that even a question now?

00:19:46.019 --> 00:19:49.522 position:50% align:center
I can't believe you waltzed
into my base all by yourself.

00:19:51.649 --> 00:19:55.570 position:50% align:center
Of course I did. I wanted
to see your flowers again.

00:19:55.653 --> 00:19:58.114 position:50% align:center
They're pretty.

00:19:58.198 --> 00:20:01.201 position:50% align:center
I did make you a
promise, didn't I?

00:20:07.165 --> 00:20:09.250 position:50% align:center
They're irises.

00:20:09.334 --> 00:20:12.504 position:50% align:center
Yeah. How do you like them?

00:20:15.215 --> 00:20:17.342 position:50% align:center
[IRIS]
I love you, Sister!

00:21:56.399 --> 00:21:57.525 position:50% align:center
[gunshots]

00:21:57.609 --> 00:22:01.279 position:50% align:center
[CREWMAN groaning]

00:22:01.363 --> 00:22:04.699 position:50% align:center
[CREWMAN A] The guy in
glasses, he's a monster!

00:22:04.783 --> 00:22:06.034 position:50% align:center
Looks like the 8th Company

00:22:06.117 --> 00:22:08.495 position:50% align:center
has more or less
completely routed us.

00:22:08.578 --> 00:22:10.997 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA, IRIS]
Must've been the lieutenant.

00:22:11.081 --> 00:22:12.540 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA sighs]

00:22:12.624 --> 00:22:15.168 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA] How am I gonna explain
this mess to the higher-ups?

00:22:15.251 --> 00:22:18.380 position:50% align:center
For that matter, what should
I tell this spilt gravel?

00:22:18.463 --> 00:22:20.256 position:50% align:center
Think Captain Obi had a plan.

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:22.425 position:50% align:center
He was gonna try and set
everything up to look like

00:22:22.509 --> 00:22:24.886 position:50% align:center
a nocturnal joint
training exercise.

00:22:24.969 --> 00:22:26.304 position:50% align:center
But you flew in before he could

00:22:26.388 --> 00:22:28.264 position:50% align:center
lay the groundwork
for that, right?

00:22:28.348 --> 00:22:29.808 position:50% align:center
If you keep charging
ahead like that,

00:22:29.891 --> 00:22:32.310 position:50% align:center
you're bound to screw
up eventually.

00:22:33.436 --> 00:22:35.689 position:50% align:center
I think I've come up
with a good solution.

00:22:35.772 --> 00:22:38.233 position:50% align:center
What if we smooth things over
with a fun little dinner party

00:22:38.316 --> 00:22:40.026 position:50% align:center
between the 5th and
8th Companies?

00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:42.362 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
That seems a bit outlandish.

00:22:42.445 --> 00:22:45.490 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA]
And yet, it just might work.

00:22:45.573 --> 00:22:47.283 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Uh. Huh?

00:22:47.367 --> 00:22:49.494 position:50% align:center
There are times when
the most ridiculous ruses

00:22:49.577 --> 00:22:52.747 position:50% align:center
are the ones people are
least likely to suspect.

00:22:52.831 --> 00:22:54.290 position:50% align:center
I can tell everybody
that to test

00:22:54.374 --> 00:22:55.959 position:50% align:center
the fighting strength
of Company 5,

00:22:56.042 --> 00:22:57.794 position:50% align:center
I planned a surprise
attack drill,

00:22:57.877 --> 00:23:00.588 position:50% align:center
asking Company 8
to play the bad guys.

00:23:00.672 --> 00:23:03.550 position:50% align:center
Shinra, would you mind rounding
up the rest of the 8th

00:23:03.633 --> 00:23:06.511 position:50% align:center
and filling them in
on the new situation?

00:23:06.594 --> 00:23:09.514 position:50% align:center
You sure are being
cooperative now.

00:23:12.809 --> 00:23:14.102 position:50% align:center
Well, yeah.

00:23:14.185 --> 00:23:17.147 position:50% align:center
That's because I've
taken a liking to you.

00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:18.314 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Uh.

00:23:18.398 --> 00:23:19.566 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:23:23.778 --> 00:23:25.655 position:50% align:center
[OBI] Chief, I know
it's ahead of schedule,

00:23:25.739 --> 00:23:28.241 position:50% align:center
but we've begun our
investigation of the 5th.

00:23:28.324 --> 00:23:29.701 position:50% align:center
There might be violence,

00:23:29.784 --> 00:23:32.203 position:50% align:center
so make what
preparations you can.

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:48.553 position:50% align:center
Hinawa, you read me?

00:23:48.636 --> 00:23:49.387 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:23:49.471 --> 00:23:51.139 position:50% align:center
Took time to set things up,

00:23:51.222 --> 00:23:54.309 position:50% align:center
but I'm ready to give
you some backup.

00:23:54.392 --> 00:23:56.644 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:23:56.728 --> 00:23:58.188 position:50% align:center
It's over?
