00:00:25.275 --> 00:00:29.362 position:50% align:center
[IRIS] Many years ago,
mankind faced a divine fury.

00:00:29.446 --> 00:00:32.365 position:50% align:center
In an event is known as
the "Day of the Cataclysm,"

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:35.368 position:50% align:center
our entire world was burned.

00:00:35.452 --> 00:00:37.078 position:50% align:center
The fire raged with an intensity

00:00:37.162 --> 00:00:40.040 position:50% align:center
that threatened to
reduce mankind to ash.

00:00:40.123 --> 00:00:43.126 position:50% align:center
The places they lived,
the languages they spoke,

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:45.086 position:50% align:center
the culture they had built.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.422 position:50% align:center
None could escape its wrath.

00:00:55.972 --> 00:00:57.640 position:50% align:center
[YONA]
This is Yona.

00:00:57.724 --> 00:01:00.060 position:50% align:center
Yes. That's right.

00:01:00.143 --> 00:01:02.562 position:50% align:center
He's still cut off
from most of Company 8.

00:01:02.645 --> 00:01:05.398 position:50% align:center
No signs of movement from
the two of them so far.

00:01:05.482 --> 00:01:08.026 position:50% align:center
But it's a matter of time.

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:10.362 position:50% align:center
Shinra Kusakabe
and Commander Sho

00:01:10.445 --> 00:01:12.739 position:50% align:center
will make their second contact.

00:01:12.822 --> 00:01:16.201 position:50% align:center
All shall transpire as
the Evangelist foresaw.

00:01:16.284 --> 00:01:18.661 position:50% align:center
<i>LÃ¡tom.</i>

00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:20.705 position:50% align:center
The show is just
getting started.

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:23.541 position:50% align:center
I think I'll try to find
a place to spectate from.

00:01:23.625 --> 00:01:25.585 position:50% align:center
[HAUMEA]
I'll come, too.

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:27.212 position:50% align:center
[YONA]
Don't sneak up on me like that!

00:01:27.295 --> 00:01:29.839 position:50% align:center
You startled me, Haumea!

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:31.299 position:50% align:center
[HAUMEA]
A person with an Adolla Burst

00:01:31.383 --> 00:01:34.010 position:50% align:center
who isn't me or Sho
has come here, right?

00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:36.471 position:50% align:center
I feel like it's
finally happening.

00:01:39.516 --> 00:01:43.353 position:50% align:center
Yes, after nearly two centuries
on the Solar calendar,

00:01:43.436 --> 00:01:46.773 position:50% align:center
I daresay the Evangelist
will be pleased.

00:01:49.317 --> 00:01:53.279 position:50% align:center
[SHO] The Adolla Burst is known
to some as the Primordial Flame.

00:01:53.363 --> 00:01:55.740 position:50% align:center
To some as the
Flame of Perdition.

00:01:55.824 --> 00:01:58.451 position:50% align:center
It's one of the world's
greatest mysteries

00:01:58.535 --> 00:02:00.328 position:50% align:center
because it never
belonged in the world

00:02:00.412 --> 00:02:02.414 position:50% align:center
that you knaves inhabit.

00:02:02.497 --> 00:02:05.333 position:50% align:center
This is where the
Adolla Burst belongs.

00:02:05.417 --> 00:02:09.254 position:50% align:center
Here in this charred dimension
of bones and black flames.

00:02:09.337 --> 00:02:13.717 position:50% align:center
So an Adolla Burst is a flame
from this other dimension.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.843 position:50% align:center
But if they don't
come from Earth,

00:02:14.926 --> 00:02:16.636 position:50% align:center
then how do I have one?

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.221 position:50% align:center
Tell me.

00:02:18.304 --> 00:02:21.558 position:50% align:center
Because absolute power cannot
be confined to any one world.

00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:23.143 position:50% align:center
Yeah? What's that mean?

00:02:23.226 --> 00:02:25.020 position:50% align:center
And as long as
I've got you here,

00:02:25.103 --> 00:02:28.898 position:50% align:center
is this place the source of
spontaneous human combustion?

00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:31.359 position:50% align:center
I'm seeing this through
our Adolla Link, right?

00:02:31.443 --> 00:02:33.236 position:50% align:center
What is it, really?

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.739 position:50% align:center
It's the underworld, Adolla.

00:02:35.822 --> 00:02:37.449 position:50% align:center
But you'd know it by
the name it received

00:02:37.532 --> 00:02:40.243 position:50% align:center
from the first
people who saw it:

00:02:40.326 --> 00:02:41.828 position:50% align:center
Hell.

00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:48.043 position:50% align:center
You look upon the
Evangelist, knave.

00:02:48.126 --> 00:02:51.546 position:50% align:center
The one who protects me,
who grants me strength.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.700 position:50% align:center
<i>take what you got and leave now</i>

00:03:20.784 --> 00:03:22.869 position:50% align:center
<i>you're wearing out your welcome</i>

00:03:22.952 --> 00:03:26.623 position:50% align:center

<i>to see you, hear you</i>

00:03:26.706 --> 00:03:28.667 position:50% align:center

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.794 position:50% align:center

<i>you know just why</i>
<i>he wants you, don't you?</i>

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:38.551 position:50% align:center
<i>you're crooked desire</i>
<i>left us in disarray</i>

00:03:38.635 --> 00:03:42.514 position:50% align:center
<i>misguided, divided</i>
<i>at the point of no return</i>

00:03:42.597 --> 00:03:46.601 position:50% align:center
<i>you started a fire,</i>
<i>you're gonna watch it burn</i>

00:03:46.685 --> 00:03:50.230 position:50% align:center
<i>try to save yourself</i>

00:03:50.313 --> 00:03:52.982 position:50% align:center

00:03:57.946 --> 00:04:00.782 position:50% align:center

00:04:00.865 --> 00:04:05.203 position:50% align:center

<i>heard us out, heard us out</i>

00:04:05.286 --> 00:04:09.916 position:50% align:center
<i>screaming MAYDAY</i>

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.962 position:50% align:center
<i>MAYDAY</i>

00:04:14.045 --> 00:04:17.966 position:50% align:center
<i>MAYDAY</i>

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:21.678 position:50% align:center
<i>MAYDAY</i>

00:04:34.566 --> 00:04:36.609 position:50% align:center
So, you're the Evangelist?

00:04:36.693 --> 00:04:38.403 position:50% align:center
You're the one who's
using those bugs

00:04:38.486 --> 00:04:40.989 position:50% align:center
to turn people into Infernals?

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:50.498 position:50% align:center
We're back here.

00:04:50.582 --> 00:04:52.459 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Hey, Shinra. You okay?

00:04:52.542 --> 00:04:55.295 position:50% align:center
What's goin' on?
Did something happen?

00:04:55.378 --> 00:04:56.588 position:50% align:center
[clanking]

00:04:59.549 --> 00:05:02.010 position:50% align:center
Because of the grace
of the Evangelist,

00:05:02.093 --> 00:05:04.637 position:50% align:center
I am possessed of
an absolute power.

00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:07.891 position:50% align:center
You may have an Adolla Burst,
but you can't win.

00:05:07.974 --> 00:05:10.602 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] He's stealing heat
from the rest of the universe.

00:05:10.685 --> 00:05:13.980 position:50% align:center
As it cools, the universe's
expansion slows down.

00:05:14.064 --> 00:05:16.274 position:50% align:center
That's how he's able
to make time stop!

00:05:16.358 --> 00:05:19.611 position:50% align:center
That doesn't sound possible,
even with an Adolla Burst.

00:05:21.446 --> 00:05:23.365 position:50% align:center
Your ally has the right of it.

00:05:23.448 --> 00:05:25.909 position:50% align:center
I cool the universe
to slow its expansion,

00:05:25.992 --> 00:05:27.494 position:50% align:center
which lets me stop time.

00:05:27.577 --> 00:05:30.330 position:50% align:center
So it doesn't matter how
fast you can move, Shinra.

00:05:30.413 --> 00:05:31.790 position:50% align:center
If he can literally freeze time,

00:05:31.873 --> 00:05:34.542 position:50% align:center
then you've got no
hope of catching him.

00:05:34.626 --> 00:05:36.920 position:50% align:center
I know it's a long shot...

00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:39.547 position:50% align:center
...but that doesn't mean
I'm gonna give up!

00:05:52.185 --> 00:05:53.186 position:50% align:center
Damn it.

00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:55.397 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.816 position:50% align:center
No matter how fast
you attempt to fly,

00:05:57.899 --> 00:05:59.943 position:50% align:center
my power will
freeze you in place.

00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:02.362 position:50% align:center
You're a cocky little brat.

00:06:10.203 --> 00:06:11.788 position:50% align:center
Damn.

00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:15.375 position:50% align:center
It's no use. He'll destroy you.

00:06:15.458 --> 00:06:17.502 position:50% align:center
You have no hope of victory.

00:06:17.585 --> 00:06:19.921 position:50% align:center
A knave like you
could never best me.

00:06:20.005 --> 00:06:21.089 position:50% align:center
What did you say?

00:06:21.172 --> 00:06:23.299 position:50% align:center
[SHO]
I called you a hopeless knave.

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:24.551 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Yeah.

00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:26.386 position:50% align:center
You've been calling me
"knave" this whole time.

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:28.722 position:50% align:center
Where did you even learn
that stupid word?

00:06:28.805 --> 00:06:29.889 position:50% align:center
Here's an idea.

00:06:29.973 --> 00:06:32.684 position:50% align:center
Show some respect
and call me "brother"!

00:06:37.105 --> 00:06:39.816 position:50% align:center
Agh! You've really
gone and done it now!

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:41.109 position:50% align:center
Let's do this, punk.

00:06:41.192 --> 00:06:43.361 position:50% align:center
One way or another,
I will catch you.

00:06:43.445 --> 00:06:45.238 position:50% align:center
You've got this, big bro!

00:06:45.321 --> 00:06:48.074 position:50% align:center
You're not my bro.

00:06:48.158 --> 00:06:50.160 position:50% align:center
Let's get back to
our game of tag now.

00:06:50.243 --> 00:06:52.162 position:50% align:center
Last time we tried
to play was a bust.

00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:54.122 position:50% align:center
You couldn't quite walk yet.

00:06:54.205 --> 00:06:57.334 position:50% align:center
Cease your rambling.
It means nothing to me.

00:06:57.417 --> 00:06:59.711 position:50% align:center
Now, start running, Sho.

00:06:59.794 --> 00:07:02.630 position:50% align:center
Your brother is "it,"
and he's comin' in hot.

00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:17.479 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:07:23.234 --> 00:07:26.196 position:50% align:center
I'm startin' to wonder if
you've ever done this before.

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:29.574 position:50% align:center
You can't hit the tagger, Sho.
It's against the rules.

00:07:29.657 --> 00:07:32.452 position:50% align:center
I have no intention of
playing your foolish game.

00:07:32.535 --> 00:07:34.913 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah? Ya scared
you'll lose?

00:07:36.498 --> 00:07:37.874 position:50% align:center
Here's the thing,

00:07:37.957 --> 00:07:40.835 position:50% align:center
I didn't come all the way
down here to pass the time.

00:07:41.878 --> 00:07:45.423 position:50% align:center
Hey, there. Ready to play
a game with your big bro?

00:07:50.845 --> 00:07:53.306 position:50% align:center
[SHO]
He forced a Link with me.

00:07:54.724 --> 00:07:55.975 position:50% align:center
This is crazy.

00:07:56.059 --> 00:07:58.728 position:50% align:center
I think you're getting
even faster, Shinra.

00:08:03.108 --> 00:08:04.567 position:50% align:center
Got pretty close.

00:08:04.651 --> 00:08:06.569 position:50% align:center
But I was faster than
I thought I'd be.

00:08:06.653 --> 00:08:09.280 position:50% align:center
Guess that messed up my timing.

00:08:09.364 --> 00:08:11.199 position:50% align:center
What are you doing?

00:08:14.577 --> 00:08:17.038 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] I see why Sho's
ability is so strong.

00:08:17.122 --> 00:08:18.248 position:50% align:center
It must be because he has

00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:21.001 position:50% align:center
such a powerful
connection to Adolla.

00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:23.962 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
An Adolla Link.

00:08:24.045 --> 00:08:25.880 position:50% align:center
I felt a weird
sensation in my feet,

00:08:25.964 --> 00:08:27.924 position:50% align:center
and then suddenly, I was faster.

00:08:28.008 --> 00:08:30.385 position:50% align:center
Was that 'cause of
an Adolla Link, too?

00:08:31.678 --> 00:08:35.306 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] As for the
Evangelist--who is that, really?

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:37.600 position:50% align:center
Or should I say, "What?"

00:08:39.394 --> 00:08:41.312 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
I don't need those answers yet.

00:08:41.396 --> 00:08:43.231 position:50% align:center
I just need their
grace or whatever.

00:08:43.314 --> 00:08:46.109 position:50% align:center
It'll make me strong.

00:08:46.192 --> 00:08:48.111 position:50% align:center
But how do I get it?

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.456 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] I've experienced
Adolla Links on accident

00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:01.249 position:50% align:center
more than once.

00:09:01.332 --> 00:09:03.251 position:50% align:center
Gotta make it happen.

00:09:06.671 --> 00:09:08.298 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:12.761 --> 00:09:14.220 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
The way this is going,

00:09:14.304 --> 00:09:16.514 position:50% align:center
I don't think I'm gonna last.

00:09:22.103 --> 00:09:24.397 position:50% align:center
[SHO]
Severed Universe.

00:09:26.024 --> 00:09:27.817 position:50% align:center
Ohh.

00:09:34.908 --> 00:09:38.036 position:50% align:center
It's a matter of time
before you collapse.

00:09:38.119 --> 00:09:40.747 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Twice now the
emotions of another person

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:42.832 position:50% align:center
have found their way inside me.

00:09:42.916 --> 00:09:46.127 position:50% align:center
First, there was Lieutenant
Konro's need for help.

00:09:46.211 --> 00:09:49.756 position:50% align:center
And second was
Giovanni's bloodlust.

00:09:49.839 --> 00:09:53.885 position:50% align:center
I get it now. Those were
caused by an Adolla Link.

00:09:53.968 --> 00:09:57.597 position:50% align:center
Up to now, I've only been
on the receiving end.

00:09:57.681 --> 00:10:01.309 position:50% align:center
But this time, I'll be
the one charging in!

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:05.355 position:50% align:center
I'm telling you, an Adolla
Burst without grace can't win.

00:10:05.438 --> 00:10:07.357 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'm aware of that!

00:10:21.538 --> 00:10:23.456 position:50% align:center
Hey, Shinra!
I think we should run.

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:26.251 position:50% align:center
If this keeps up, you're
just gonna get killed.

00:10:35.427 --> 00:10:36.428 position:50% align:center
[SHO]
Why?

00:10:36.511 --> 00:10:38.888 position:50% align:center
When it's this obvious
there's no hope,

00:10:38.972 --> 00:10:41.433 position:50% align:center
why do you keep
charging forward?

00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:47.230 position:50% align:center
Because my brother needs me.

00:10:47.313 --> 00:10:50.775 position:50% align:center
Because, even now,
we're still family.

00:10:50.859 --> 00:10:53.236 position:50% align:center
Why do you place
importance in blood?

00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:55.989 position:50% align:center
I don't know you, and
I'm not bound to you.

00:10:56.072 --> 00:10:57.365 position:50% align:center
The thing is,

00:10:57.449 --> 00:11:00.243 position:50% align:center
there are people in my life
who I can look up to.

00:11:00.326 --> 00:11:03.747 position:50% align:center
[OBI] Well, if you think
he's alive, then so do we.

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:06.166 position:50% align:center
We'll strategize around the
premise that Shinra's brother

00:11:06.249 --> 00:11:07.667 position:50% align:center
is with the White-Clad.

00:11:07.751 --> 00:11:10.253 position:50% align:center
We were talking about how
weird you'd been acting.

00:11:10.337 --> 00:11:12.630 position:50% align:center
There's no reason for
companies outside of the 8th

00:11:12.714 --> 00:11:14.466 position:50% align:center
to meddle in the 8th's affairs.

00:11:14.549 --> 00:11:16.926 position:50% align:center
I wanna see the White-Clad
stopped for good,

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:19.179 position:50% align:center
so let's stop them together.

00:11:19.262 --> 00:11:21.848 position:50% align:center
Until ya figure out what
means the world to you,

00:11:21.931 --> 00:11:23.391 position:50% align:center
I'll take your help.

00:11:23.475 --> 00:11:28.021 position:50% align:center
I heard about your brother,
Sho. Keep him safe, okay?

00:11:29.147 --> 00:11:31.024 position:50% align:center
[SHO]
What's your point?

00:11:34.569 --> 00:11:35.945 position:50% align:center
It's that, as your big brother,

00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:39.199 position:50% align:center
I need to show you the kindness
that's been shown to me.

00:11:42.911 --> 00:11:46.956 position:50% align:center
Look, I get it.
I'm no one to you, Sho.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:50.293 position:50% align:center
I'm just some random person
who turned up out of nowhere.

00:11:50.377 --> 00:11:53.380 position:50% align:center
But to me,
you're more than that.

00:11:53.463 --> 00:11:56.132 position:50% align:center
I was told that you and
Mom had burned to death.

00:11:56.216 --> 00:11:59.678 position:50% align:center
I didn't think I'd
ever see you again.

00:11:59.761 --> 00:12:01.179 position:50% align:center
"One more time.

00:12:01.262 --> 00:12:03.848 position:50% align:center
If I could just see
them one more time."

00:12:03.932 --> 00:12:06.142 position:50% align:center
I've repeated that
wish my whole life.

00:12:06.226 --> 00:12:09.688 position:50% align:center
And now, you're here.
Right in front of me.

00:12:09.771 --> 00:12:13.108 position:50% align:center
So I'll be damned if I'm
gonna give up on you now.

00:12:13.191 --> 00:12:16.444 position:50% align:center
Your big bro's gonna
swoop in and save the day!

00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:20.990 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Sho, I'm so glad you're alive.

00:12:21.074 --> 00:12:22.826 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:12:22.909 --> 00:12:27.080 position:50% align:center
I want you to know that to me,
you're like a miracle.

00:12:29.916 --> 00:12:33.336 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
All I can do... is move faster.

00:12:34.838 --> 00:12:36.715 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Faster!

00:12:55.066 --> 00:12:56.985 position:50% align:center
He's gone.

00:12:57.068 --> 00:13:03.158 position:50% align:center
But this is my frozen world.
Nothing can move here.

00:13:03.241 --> 00:13:05.493 position:50% align:center
So where is he?

00:13:21.051 --> 00:13:22.344 position:50% align:center
Another one?

00:13:22.427 --> 00:13:24.721 position:50% align:center
Seems earthquakes are
getting more common.

00:13:24.804 --> 00:13:27.390 position:50% align:center
I'm getting a case of
nerves in my nerves.

00:13:27.474 --> 00:13:29.559 position:50% align:center
I hope Company 8's
doing all right.

00:13:29.642 --> 00:13:32.520 position:50% align:center
Keep the chatter to
a minimum please.

00:13:35.815 --> 00:13:36.775 position:50% align:center
[KARIM]
Right.

00:13:36.858 --> 00:13:39.444 position:50% align:center
[LI]
Apologies, Lieutenant Onyango.

00:13:39.527 --> 00:13:41.821 position:50% align:center
[BURNS] Sorry to call
you out of retirement.

00:13:41.905 --> 00:13:44.574 position:50% align:center
After Rekka's betrayal,
you had no choice.

00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:45.784 position:50% align:center
And if you're still
at the front,

00:13:45.867 --> 00:13:47.911 position:50% align:center
I may as well fight with you.

00:13:47.994 --> 00:13:49.913 position:50% align:center
How's that right eye
of yours feel?

00:13:49.996 --> 00:13:53.333 position:50% align:center
Do all these recent earthquakes
mean what I think?

00:13:53.416 --> 00:13:55.085 position:50% align:center
I failed that Shinra kid.

00:13:55.168 --> 00:13:57.796 position:50% align:center
I wanted him to stay
out of all this.

00:14:02.759 --> 00:14:05.053 position:50% align:center
[SHO]
Where did he go?

00:14:07.222 --> 00:14:10.475 position:50% align:center
[SHO] Should I return time
to its normal speed?

00:14:10.558 --> 00:14:13.019 position:50% align:center
No, it's too dangerous
to go back

00:14:13.103 --> 00:14:16.314 position:50% align:center
without ascertaining
his movements.

00:14:16.398 --> 00:14:19.651 position:50% align:center
All right. I'm at my limit.

00:14:23.363 --> 00:14:24.739 position:50% align:center
What's this?

00:14:30.495 --> 00:14:32.747 position:50% align:center
That was rough.

00:14:32.831 --> 00:14:35.458 position:50% align:center
Don't think I've ever
gone that fast.

00:14:39.504 --> 00:14:41.673 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Went right past ya, huh.

00:14:41.756 --> 00:14:47.012 position:50% align:center
I don't get it. How did you
move all the way over there?

00:14:47.095 --> 00:14:50.348 position:50% align:center
If you don't know, then I must
be getting a lot faster.

00:14:50.432 --> 00:14:52.642 position:50% align:center
This game of tag
isn't over yet, Sho.

00:14:52.726 --> 00:14:55.437 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I promise I'm
gonna catch you.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:00.483 position:50% align:center
Hi, Sho! Do you wanna
play a game today?

00:15:02.527 --> 00:15:06.781 position:50% align:center
How did I get that memory?
Through an Adolla Link?

00:15:06.865 --> 00:15:10.827 position:50% align:center
Tell me, a moment ago,
how did you disappear?

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:14.330 position:50% align:center
Hell if I know. I was
just trying to go faster.

00:15:14.414 --> 00:15:17.584 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Sho couldn't even find
Shinra by stopping time?

00:15:17.667 --> 00:15:18.960 position:50% align:center
How could Shinra
have disappeared

00:15:19.044 --> 00:15:21.338 position:50% align:center
just by moving quickly, though?

00:15:21.421 --> 00:15:22.922 position:50% align:center
When a body travels fast enough,

00:15:23.006 --> 00:15:26.926 position:50% align:center
it reaches a threshold that it
can't withstand and falls apart.

00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:29.137 position:50% align:center
If it's traveling at
ultra-high speeds,

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:32.640 position:50% align:center
it can break down to the
level of invisible particles.

00:15:32.724 --> 00:15:34.726 position:50% align:center
No, once a person splits apart,

00:15:34.809 --> 00:15:37.020 position:50% align:center
there's no putting
them back together.

00:15:37.103 --> 00:15:39.397 position:50% align:center
Th-Then again, Commander Sho
is freezing the universe.

00:15:39.481 --> 00:15:41.149 position:50% align:center
Ha. That's pretty wild.

00:15:41.232 --> 00:15:44.611 position:50% align:center
M-Maybe with the "absolute
power" of an Adolla Burst,

00:15:44.694 --> 00:15:48.323 position:50% align:center
reassembling a disintegrated
body isn't that implausible.

00:15:48.406 --> 00:15:52.327 position:50% align:center
How is this Evangelist person
making all of this possible?

00:15:54.287 --> 00:15:55.622 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Ready or not.

00:15:55.705 --> 00:15:58.792 position:50% align:center
[SHO] I'll chill the universe
before he even moves.

00:16:04.839 --> 00:16:08.051 position:50% align:center
That hurt. Still need
to iron out some kinks.

00:16:09.719 --> 00:16:12.347 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Commander Sho
looks really surprised.

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:14.057 position:50% align:center
I know Shinra's crazy fast,

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:16.935 position:50% align:center
but could he be faster
than the speed of light?

00:16:17.018 --> 00:16:18.728 position:50% align:center
If a body goes past
the speed of light,

00:16:18.812 --> 00:16:20.730 position:50% align:center
it could go back in time.

00:16:20.814 --> 00:16:22.691 position:50% align:center
It's possible, after he splits,

00:16:22.774 --> 00:16:26.319 position:50% align:center
his hyper speed reverts his body
to the state it was in before.

00:16:29.489 --> 00:16:32.075 position:50% align:center
Wait, but if he keeps
on moving at that speed,

00:16:32.158 --> 00:16:34.577 position:50% align:center
he could create a
mini-black hole!

00:16:36.913 --> 00:16:38.373 position:50% align:center
And if that were to happen,

00:16:38.456 --> 00:16:39.958 position:50% align:center
he wouldn't only
destroy the Nether,

00:16:40.041 --> 00:16:43.461 position:50% align:center
he would probably end up wiping
out the whole Tokyo Empire!

00:16:43.545 --> 00:16:46.506 position:50% align:center
He has no idea.
Oh, I should warn him.

00:16:46.589 --> 00:16:48.425 position:50% align:center
It's the right thing
to do, I know.

00:16:48.508 --> 00:16:51.886 position:50% align:center
And yet... my curiosity's
getting the better of me.

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:55.432 position:50% align:center
I could watch it all
happen firsthand.

00:16:55.515 --> 00:16:56.975 position:50% align:center
I'm startin' to figure this out.

00:16:57.058 --> 00:17:00.395 position:50% align:center
You had better dodge this one
or else you're gonna be it.

00:17:05.191 --> 00:17:08.903 position:50% align:center
As long as I use my power
first, I can stop you.

00:17:08.987 --> 00:17:12.323 position:50% align:center
I'm a bit surprised that you
managed to force an Adolla Link.

00:17:12.407 --> 00:17:15.285 position:50% align:center
But still, you're nothing
I can't handle.

00:17:15.368 --> 00:17:17.495 position:50% align:center
At least this fight
wasn't boring.

00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:18.663 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:24.961 --> 00:17:28.006 position:50% align:center
[gasps] He broke into
my frozen universe.

00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:30.258 position:50% align:center
Oh. Did I land a hit?

00:17:30.342 --> 00:17:31.301 position:50% align:center
Ooh!

00:17:31.384 --> 00:17:33.053 position:50% align:center
[SHO]
This shouldn't be possible.

00:17:33.136 --> 00:17:36.473 position:50% align:center
How were you able to move
inside my suspended world?

00:17:36.556 --> 00:17:39.267 position:50% align:center
And with a flame the
Evangelist hasn't graced.

00:17:39.351 --> 00:17:41.061 position:50% align:center
Did what was done to me,

00:17:41.144 --> 00:17:43.313 position:50% align:center
back when I linked with
Konro and Giovanni.

00:17:43.396 --> 00:17:45.607 position:50% align:center
It was the strength of
their feelings that did it,

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:47.942 position:50% align:center
so I used mine to
connect with you.

00:17:48.026 --> 00:17:51.571 position:50% align:center
And since you're linked
to the Evangelist, well...

00:17:51.654 --> 00:17:55.325 position:50% align:center
When I connected with you,
I got some Evangelist as well.

00:17:55.408 --> 00:17:59.120 position:50% align:center
What are you saying? That you
stole some grace from me?

00:18:01.289 --> 00:18:03.708 position:50% align:center
You see, Haumea,
it's finally happening!

00:18:03.792 --> 00:18:04.793 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:18:04.876 --> 00:18:06.503 position:50% align:center
His Adolla Burst
has been activated

00:18:06.586 --> 00:18:08.963 position:50% align:center
through a Link with
the Evangelist.

00:18:09.047 --> 00:18:10.965 position:50% align:center
One might say
it's the awakening

00:18:11.049 --> 00:18:12.842 position:50% align:center
of a fourth generation.

00:18:12.926 --> 00:18:14.594 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Commander Sho
might be able to arrest

00:18:14.678 --> 00:18:17.639 position:50% align:center
the universe's expansion
to stop time,

00:18:17.722 --> 00:18:21.643 position:50% align:center
but Shinra can stop time by
moving faster than lightspeed.

00:18:22.811 --> 00:18:25.188 position:50% align:center
We've similar skills.

00:18:25.271 --> 00:18:26.940 position:50% align:center
Have at you.

00:18:44.207 --> 00:18:46.751 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
I'm keeping my promise to Mom.

00:18:46.835 --> 00:18:49.462 position:50% align:center
I will bring Sho back home.

00:18:49.546 --> 00:18:52.507 position:50% align:center
He's standing right there.

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:54.509 position:50% align:center
I just have to catch him!

00:19:04.394 --> 00:19:05.437 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:17.407 position:50% align:center
I haven't got a clue
what's going on.

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:19.909 position:50% align:center
Are you able to see it,
Haumea? Or no?

00:19:19.993 --> 00:19:22.829 position:50% align:center
Eh. I can, more or less.

00:19:22.912 --> 00:19:25.665 position:50% align:center
I wonder, for every word or
two that passes between us,

00:19:25.749 --> 00:19:28.168 position:50% align:center
how many blows do you
think they exchange?

00:19:28.251 --> 00:19:31.504 position:50% align:center
I'm not even human
and I couldn't say!

00:19:33.423 --> 00:19:34.966 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
So did you get me last?

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:36.301 position:50% align:center
I kinda lost track.

00:19:36.384 --> 00:19:38.053 position:50% align:center
[SHO]
What are you talking about?

00:19:38.136 --> 00:19:39.512 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Our game of tag.

00:19:39.596 --> 00:19:42.849 position:50% align:center
Which one of us is
it now? You or me?

00:19:42.932 --> 00:19:44.642 position:50% align:center
Ridiculous.

00:19:48.188 --> 00:19:50.482 position:50% align:center
You're a persistent knave,
I'll give you that.

00:19:50.565 --> 00:19:52.817 position:50% align:center
But you need to accept
I'm not your brother.

00:19:52.901 --> 00:19:56.279 position:50% align:center
Why are you getting such an
attitude? Rebellious phase?

00:19:56.363 --> 00:20:00.158 position:50% align:center
Don't show up from nowhere
and pretend we're family!

00:20:02.327 --> 00:20:04.162 position:50% align:center
Doin' great, bro, keep it up.

00:20:04.245 --> 00:20:06.581 position:50% align:center
If ya catch me,
I'll give you a treat.

00:20:09.334 --> 00:20:11.961 position:50% align:center
What's this? Has your speed
begun to drop off?

00:20:12.045 --> 00:20:15.256 position:50% align:center
Not a chance.
I can do this all day.

00:20:21.388 --> 00:20:24.099 position:50% align:center
It looks like you've
all-but overheated.

00:20:27.602 --> 00:20:31.731 position:50% align:center
It's over. I'm taking
you to the Evangelist.

00:20:31.815 --> 00:20:34.567 position:50% align:center
We have need of
your Adolla Burst.

00:20:39.781 --> 00:20:41.157 position:50% align:center
Damn it.

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.743 position:50% align:center
Shinra! Wait a sec!

00:20:43.827 --> 00:20:45.829 position:50% align:center
You need to stop
fighting right now.

00:20:45.912 --> 00:20:48.039 position:50% align:center
If you get overheated
while using your fire,

00:20:48.123 --> 00:20:50.834 position:50% align:center
there's no undoing
the damage it'll cause!

00:20:52.168 --> 00:20:53.712 position:50% align:center
You've gotta listen to me.

00:20:53.795 --> 00:20:55.630 position:50% align:center
Whenever you move fast
enough to stop time,

00:20:55.714 --> 00:20:57.340 position:50% align:center
your body disintegrates!

00:20:57.424 --> 00:20:59.676 position:50% align:center
In that moment, you die!

00:20:59.759 --> 00:21:02.512 position:50% align:center
You think I've been dying?

00:21:02.595 --> 00:21:03.930 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] You use your
flames to accelerate

00:21:04.014 --> 00:21:05.056 position:50% align:center
to the speed of light.

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:08.226 position:50% align:center
That's how you're stopping time.

00:21:08.309 --> 00:21:09.769 position:50% align:center
But that tears up your body,

00:21:09.853 --> 00:21:12.522 position:50% align:center
breaks it into
subatomic particles.

00:21:12.605 --> 00:21:14.649 position:50% align:center
Then, by accelerating
past the speed of light,

00:21:14.733 --> 00:21:17.277 position:50% align:center
those particles go back in time!

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.821 position:50% align:center
That's how you've been
reforming yourself.

00:21:19.904 --> 00:21:22.073 position:50% align:center
But if you overheat in the
middle of that process,

00:21:22.157 --> 00:21:24.075 position:50% align:center
then you'll actually die.

00:21:24.159 --> 00:21:26.745 position:50% align:center
In a way you can't
come back from.

00:21:26.828 --> 00:21:29.372 position:50% align:center
You're saying I could
die for real?

00:21:31.166 --> 00:21:35.879 position:50% align:center
What's so amusing?
That grin turns my stomach.

00:21:35.962 --> 00:21:39.632 position:50% align:center
Give it a rest, will ya?
It's a nervous tic.

00:21:43.762 --> 00:21:45.930 position:50% align:center
Or... it was before.

00:21:46.014 --> 00:21:49.184 position:50% align:center
But I don't feel nervous
at all right now.

00:21:49.267 --> 00:21:52.312 position:50% align:center
I guess I'm just happy
to be playing with you.

00:21:55.607 --> 00:21:57.984 position:50% align:center
Stop putting things
into my head.

00:21:58.068 --> 00:22:01.154 position:50% align:center
These visions disgust me.

00:22:01.237 --> 00:22:02.655 position:50% align:center
Don't do it, Shinra!

00:22:02.739 --> 00:22:04.824 position:50% align:center
You won't be able to
come back this time!

00:22:04.908 --> 00:22:07.660 position:50% align:center
I will come back.

00:22:07.744 --> 00:22:10.955 position:50% align:center
Because I refuse to leave
you alone, you hear me?

00:22:13.124 --> 00:22:15.502 position:50% align:center
If I left you to fend
for yourself again,

00:22:15.585 --> 00:22:18.171 position:50% align:center
then what kinda big
brother would I be?
