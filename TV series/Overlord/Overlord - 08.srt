I was starting to get worried
something bad had happened.

Shame on you for making me wait.

Oh, sorry.

[CLEMINTINE cackles]
'Course he doesn't.

Nphirea! Get behind us.

what I need for my plans.

Whether you like it or not,

your friend and I are
going to cast a spell.

We're dealing with at least
a third tier spell caster.

One that decided to use
Create Undead on these men

instead of just
hiding the bodies.

133
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,583
Which is odd, since that
would have given them

a bigger head start.

The culprits were confident
that they would get away.

And wanted to advertise
the power they possess

and are willing to use.

What happened here
was a tragedy.

But you are lucky,

And I'm currently
in between missions.

If you want to save

accept your offer.

Just go save him,

[AINS] I will. But my
services are not cheap.

means to pay my fee?

00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,541
for their very souls.

162
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:40,125
Is that what you're
asking of me now?

163
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:42,375
Are you two really demons?

164
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:44,375
[AINS] Would you not be
willing to pay that price

165
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:47,041
for his life? It would
be a shame to lose

166
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:48,750
such a talented young man.

167
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,083
[growls]

168
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,375
[AINS] Time's ticking away
and I need an answer.

169
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,125
Make it quick.

170
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:57,125
You win. Consider
yourself hired, devil.

171
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:59,458
Take whatever you want from me.

172
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,875
[AINS] The first thing
we need to do is locate

173
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:04,875
where Nphirea is being held.

174
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,375
[NARBERAL]
How will we figure that out?

175
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:09,041
[AINS]
The criminals made one mistake.

176
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,916
Although they didn't
steal any valuables,

177
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,583
they took the time to remove
each man's adventurer plate.

178
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:17,958
Any guesses why that is?

179
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:20,916
The plates are worthless.
So I'm not sure.

180
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
--[AINS] I'll explain.
--[beeping]

181
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,333
[ENTOMA]
Lord Ains?

182
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:25,500
[AINS]
Entoma.

183
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,208
[ENTOMA]
I have some information.

184
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:28,916
[AINS]
You caught me at a bad time.

185
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,458
I'm in the middle
of something right now,

186
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:32,500
but I'll notify you
when I'm available.

187
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:35,208
[ENTOMA]
Certainly, master. Also,

188
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:38,500
Lady Albedo asks
that you contact her.

189
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,125
[AINS]
As I was saying.

190
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:42,625
The plates were taken
as hunting trophies.

191
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:45,708
I'm assuming the culprit
collects them as souvenirs.

192
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:47,500
Which is lucky for us
since we now have

193
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:51,750
something to track. We'll use
the Locate Object scroll.

194
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:56,833
[AINS]
You already know how to use it.

195
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:58,833
Let's find ourselves
some plates.

196
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:00,625
I'll activate it now.

197
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:02,083
[AINS]
Hold on.

198
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:04,833
The enemy may have set the
counter spell Detect Locate.

199
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:07,708
So we need to cast Fake Cover
and Counter Detection

200
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:11,541
to break through any defenses
they may have prepared.

201
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:14,458
[AINS]
Hm. There's no way

202
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:16,583
for them to hide from
all these spells.

203
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:19,958
So, start whenever
you're ready, Narberal.

204
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:22,875
"Fake Cover."

205
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,500
"Counter Detection."

206
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,166
[MOMONGA]
We have to be careful.

207
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:34,083
Collecting information
with magic is dangerous.

208
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,416
This encounter may
end in a Player Kill.

209
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,250
And if that happens, we need
to be overly prepared for it.

210
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:42,916
The Player's Handbook that
Punitto Moe wrote taught me

211
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,458
the importance of
attacking hard and fast.

212
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:48,416
[NARBERAL]
"Locate Object"!

213
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:53,125
[NARBERAL]
Right here.

214
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:55,375
[AINS] That's in the
middle of the cemetery.

215
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:57,041
A fitting choice.

216
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,250
Please cast Clairvoyance
and Crystal Monitor

217
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:02,750
at the same time.
I want to see for myself.

218
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:05,208
"Clairvoyance"!
"Crystal Monitor"!

219
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:12,625
[AINS]
I see Nphirea. Among the undead.

220
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:15,125
And I can sense the ones
that stole the plates.

221
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,625
They are nearby.

222
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:18,125
What are your orders?

223
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:20,625
We could teleport there
and attack immediately.

224
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:23,000
Or use magic and launch
an assault from the sky.

225
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,291
[AINS]
Don't be foolish.

226
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:25,375
[gasps]

227
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:26,958
[AINS]
An army of the undead is ready

228
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:28,833
for such a reckless attack.

229
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:30,666
Whoever woke up that many
men from their graves

230
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:34,500
has something big planned
for them. That's good news.

231
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:37,375
Our names will spread far and
wide once we save Nphirea,

232
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:40,625
and stop whatever grand scheme
they're trying to pull.

233
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:44,083
[AINS] Unfortunately,
we have to move fast

234
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:47,500
and have no time to research
their plan further.

235
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,791
We've finished.

236
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,541
What have you discovered?

237
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52,541
[AINS] They have fled
into the cemetery.

238
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:53,916
Is my grandson there?

239
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,291
[AINS]
Yes.

240
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,666
He's being guarded by a
large legion of the undead.

241
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,875
[gasps]

242
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:00,375
[AINS]
Don't be scared.

243
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:02,916
Nabe and I can handle
them, but a few undead

244
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,916
may escape the grounds.

245
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,625
That's why we need you
to let the townsfolk

246
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:09,375
and Adventurer's Guild
know what's happening.

247
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:12,875
We are headed to the cemetery
now, so you need to be quick.

248
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:15,375
Hold it. Just how do
you plan on defeating

249
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,958
such a large army of the undead?

250
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:21,833
[AINS]
With this weapon right here.

251
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:34,375
[SOLDIER 8A] Looks like
another uneventful night.

252
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:36,625
It's been awhile since
we've seen any action.

--Even the undead
--[groaning]

254

00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:41,458
Huh? What was that noise?

256
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,291
Nice try, man, stop trying to--

257
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,791
Be quiet. I think
I heard it again.

258
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:47,000
It's just in your head.

[SOLDIER 8C]
Hey! Something's coming!

260

I don't believe it.

00:12:57,708 --> 00:13:00,250
[SOLDIER 8A]
It's an entire army.

262
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:02,666
[CAPTAIN 8A] I've never seen
this many undead at once.

263
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,583
There's at least 1,000 of 'em!

264
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:06,833
Notify the reserves, quickly!

265
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:10,875
We'll try to hold them off
the gate until backup arrives.

Huh? An adventurer?
Thank goodness.

Damn, he's just a
useless copper plate!

Open the gate.

You have a death wish?

Fine then.

[SOLDIER 8B]
It's not possible.

304
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,708
There's no way they
defeated that many undead

all by themselves.

[SOLDIER 8C] That man.
What was his name again?

307
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:17,541
Momon, I think. I've never
heard of him before.

00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,500
And we're sure he was
only a copper plate?

309
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:20,666
Seems wrong.

310

he's the fabled

heard rumors about.

Whatever he is,

00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,416
we just witnessed
a myth in the making.

314

The legend of a
raven black warrior

who becomes a hero!

00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,166
The inhuman Lady
Clementine doesn't

474
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,041
lose brawls to
nobodies like you.

475
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:39,791
You're about to learn
why people fear me!

476
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:42,375
[AINS]
I see nothing to be scared of.

477
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:46,875
You're a joke.
Now shut up and fight!

478
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,541
[AINS] I finally find the
person that I had been seeking.

479
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:23,458
She's hiding deep within
the heart of the cemetary.

480
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:26,125
The fool who destroyed
The Swords of Darkness,

481
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:28,833
some of my most valuable
assets thus far,

482
00:24:28,916 --> 00:24:32,333
is a psychotic female
fighter named Clemintine.

483
00:24:32,416 --> 00:24:34,208
She uses her
signature, "Stiletto,"

484
00:24:34,291 --> 00:24:37,458
to torture and maim her prey,
and even claims her skills

485
00:24:37,541 --> 00:24:40,083
have surpassed
human limitations.

486
00:24:40,166 --> 00:24:43,750
Well... I'll have to show
her what it really means

487
00:24:43,833 --> 00:24:45,791
to be inhuman.

488
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:48,916
Chapter nine:
"The Dark Warrior."
