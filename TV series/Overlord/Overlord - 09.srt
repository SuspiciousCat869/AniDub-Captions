about melee combat.

163
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,666
Like the importance of
balancing your attacks,

164
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,833
and properly utilizing
martial arts skills.

165
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:03,375
Huh? You just learned that?
What kind of warrior are you?

166
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:05,958
More importantly, why didn't
you take any damage

167
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:08,041
after my attack hit home?

168
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:12,458
Tell me. Was it a defense skill?

169
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,375
[AINS]
You have my gratitude.

170
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:17,708
I wish I could stay and see
what else you have to offer.

171
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:20,541
Sadly, I can't afford
to wait any longer.

172
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:23,416
I'm afraid playtime has to end.

173
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,375
Huh?

174
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:27,166
[AINS]
Narberal Gamma!

175
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:30,166
Show them the power of Nazarick!

176
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:35,666
What the hell?

177
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:40,125
[AINS] Now. Steel yourself
for death and come at me.

[KHAJIT laughs]

180
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:54,458
Surrender now, and I might
decide to be merciful.

181
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:58,000
Humans are too cocky.

182
00:11:58,083 --> 00:11:59,083
What was that?

183
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:01,000
You should learn
your rightful place--

184
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:03,166
Beneath us.

185
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:06,083
Crush her, Skeletal Dragons!

186
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:08,875
[SKELETAL DRAGONS roar]

--[AINS] Narberal Gamma!

00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:11,458
Huh?

189
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:14,208
[AINS]
Show them the power of Nazarick!

190
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:15,791
Uh--

191
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:20,541
As you wish, my lord.

192
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:22,958
I will no longer
fight you as Nabe.

193
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:26,583
Now you face Narberal
Gamma of the Pleiades.

194
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:31,625
[SKELETAL DRAGONS roar]

195
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,291
"Teleportation."

[gasps]

197
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:47,250
Now, "Fly."

198
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:54,041
[KHAJIT]
She vanished? Where did she go?

199
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:55,333
[gasps]

200
00:12:56,875 --> 00:13:00,000
She's even able
to cast flying magic?

201
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:03,625
But, still, she didn't have
time to dodge their attack.

202
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,625
What's she doing?

203
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:08,708
This is a perfect
chance to escape.

204
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:11,125
Why isn't she running
for her life?

205
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:13,291
She can't possibly
think she has a chance

206
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:16,625
of overcoming complete
magical resistance!

207
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:17,875
There are plenty of ways

208
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:21,291
that I can defeat your
dragons. I'll show you.

209
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:28,291
[NARBERAL]
Rejoice, human.

210
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:31,541
You have the honor of facing
a servant to the absolute ruler

211
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:33,791
of the Great Tomb of Nazarik.

212
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:36,833
The Supreme Being and rightful
Overlord of this world,

213
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:40,375
Lord Ains Ooal Gown.
You are fortunate.

214
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:42,583
As a member of the
Pleiades battle maids,

215
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:45,625
I will be your opponent.

216
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,333
A maid?

217
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:48,250
[growls]

218
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:49,458
Skeletal Dragons!

219
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:50,791
[SKELETAL DRAGONS growl]

220
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:52,166
She's gone!

00:13:56,708 --> 00:14:00,083
[groans]

222
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:04,500
Does it hurt that badly?

223
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:05,666
[KHAJIT grunts]

224
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:09,833
That was your trump card.

225
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:12,541
You hid your teleportation
magic so you could kill me

226
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:14,458
when my guard was down.

227
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:17,000
[NARBERAL]
Of course not, worm.

228
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:20,166
I was just showing you
that I could kill you easily.

229
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,875
Your dragons will
be no different.

230
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:25,625
Insane. You're out of your mind!

231
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:28,000
[NARBERAL] I didn't expect
an insignificant flea

232
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:32,166
like you to understand.
Still, your reply is pitiful.

233
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,625
[KHAJIT]
How dare you.

234
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:35,541
[NARBERAL]
It's time I ended this farce.

235
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,125
After all, if I made
my lord wait too long,

236
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:40,750
what kind of maid would I be?

237
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,166
Do you truly believe
these dragons of yours

238
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,208
are immune to magic?

239
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:50,833
You have a lot to learn
about being a caster.

240
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:54,458
I'll have you pay for this
lesson with your pathetic life.

241
00:14:56,250 --> 00:15:00,416
[gasps] What kind
of magic is that?

242
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,291
Try it. They're both
still immune.

243
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:07,833
Nothing you throw
at them will matter!

244
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:09,666
[NARBERAL]
Not completely immune.

245
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,625
To be more precise, their
magical resistance nullifies

246
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:15,583
any spells that are
sixth tier and below.

247
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:18,625
But I'm able to cast
even higher tiered magic.

248
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,708
If you're still having
trouble understanding,

249
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:23,500
that means I can beat
your pets with ease.

250
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:24,958
You are crazy.

251
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:27,708
No one in this world can
cast seventh tier magic.

252
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:31,125
That power belongs to the gods!

Five years. Countless schemes.

All my meticulous planning
and preparations for tonight.

257
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:41,458
I refuse to believe it
will be taken from me

258
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:45,041
by a girl in a maid outfit!

259
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:49,666
Your death will serve my master.
You should take comfort in that.

[KHAJIT screams]

It seems even
insects smell tasty

when they're roasted.

267

I'll give this to
Entoma as a souvenir.

[CLEMENTINE]
That's an interesting tactic.

Are you giving up?

[AINS] I think I should
finish up, as well.

It wouldn't be fair
to Narberal, otherwise.

Wow. You're one cocky bastard.

273
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:44,458
You don't have a single
martial arts skill,

274
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:47,708
and you think you can beat
the great Lady Clementine?

00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:50,291
Congrats, now I'm
royally pissed off.

[AINS] Are you going to
keep raving or actually

277
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:53,791
do something about it?

278
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:57,333
[growls] Y'know,
you're right, we should

279
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,416
finish things up here.

He's not moving?

284
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:12,541
Die!

285
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,333
I'm not finished with you yet!

Hm. Interesting.

00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:31,416
There wasn't a weapon
like this in Yggdrasil.

290
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,541
I'll watch out for them.

291
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:37,166
What? No way! You
shouldn't be alive!

292
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:40,291
[AINS] I guess there's
no point hiding it.

293
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:45,000
[CLEMENTINE]
An Undead? You're an Elder Lich?

294
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:47,875
[AINS] Well. You're
only partially right.

295
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:50,166
I'm curious. How did
you like fighting

296
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,708
a sword-wielding
magic caster?

...the hell?

00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:02,208
[AINS] This is why I
gave you a handicap.

301
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:03,458
You're all bark.

302
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,166
There was no need for
me to fight a mongrel

303
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,958
of your level seriously.

304
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:09,333
If I had cast the weakest
spell I know to defeat you,

305
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:11,541
it would have been
a waste of MP.

306

[screams]

307
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,625
[AINS]
What's the matter, bitch?

308
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:20,916
Did you not like my answer?
These are in the way.

309
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,791
You've... gotta be kidding!

310
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:27,833
[AINS]
All right. Let's begin.

311
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:28,833
No way.

312
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:32,208
Stop it. Stop it!

313
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:34,958
[AINS] I had considered
killing you with this.

314
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:38,833
It would have been poetic
justice at its finest.

315
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:41,166
Then again, death by blade.

316
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,500
Death by broken bones.
Death by crushing.

317
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:47,541
There's really not much
difference, is there?

318
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:49,375
In the end, you die.

[whimpers]

320

[CLEMENTINE]
Let go, you bastard!

00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:57,958
[AINS]
Stop your squirming.

322
00:18:58,041 --> 00:19:01,250
[CLEMENTINE growling]

323
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:04,250
[AINS] You took your time
killing her, didn't you?

324
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:08,375
[CLEMENTINE growling, groaning]

325
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:11,041
[AINS] It's only fair to give
you the same treatment.

326
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:13,708
Slow and painful.

327
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:22,041
[AINS]
I've enjoyed this dance.

328
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:38,625
[AINS]
I forgot to tell you.

329
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:43,833
Try as I might, I have a
tendency to be... hypocritical.

330
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:49,166
[FOREST KING]
Master! Master!

331
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:52,708
[yelps] That's not master!
It's a monster!

332
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:59,083
[NARBERAL]
Annoying gerbil.

333
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:01,833
I do not see what you do
in this creature, my lord.

334
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:03,458
He is foolish and unworthy.

335
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:04,708
[AINS]
That's enough.

336
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:06,708
The fact that he is the
Wise King of the Forest

337
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:09,708
makes him a valuable asset.

338
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:12,458
We have more important
matters to tend do.

339
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:14,916
Take anything valuable or
useful from the corpses

340
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,791
before the soldiers and
other adventurers arrive.

341
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:19,125
[NARBERAL]
Right!

342
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:22,166
Shall we take their bodies
to Nazarick for testing?

343
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,375
[AINS]
No.

344
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:24,791
We need to hand them
over to the authorities

345
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:27,041
so they have someone
to blame for all of this.

346
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:30,583
We'll just take their
equipment this time.

347
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:32,916
As you wish, my master.

348
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:45,750
[AINS] I can easily cure
his blindness with

349
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,666
healing magic, but...

350
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:53,375
As for his mind, the control
over it will be tricky to break.

351
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:56,125
This is definitely the source.

352
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,625
[AINS]
"All Appraisal Magic Item."

353
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:06,041
[AINS] The Crown of
Wisdom. Interesting.

354
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:07,250
It seems to be an item

355
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:10,375
that can't be
replicated in Yggdrasil.

356
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:13,291
Ideally, I'd like to take
him back to Nazarick.

357
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:15,541
But I took this
job on good faith.

358
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:21,333
A deliberate failure would dirty
the name of Ains Ooal Gown.

359
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:25,125
Crumble away.
"Greater Break Item"!

360
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,125
[NARBERAL]
Lord Ains.

361
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,458
Master. Please, forgive me.

362
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:39,625
Serve you with even greater
conviction, I shall!

363
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:44,458
[AINS]
That's great, Hamusuke. Anyway.

364
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:46,125
Let's complete the job!

365
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:47,291
[FOREST KING]
Master!

366
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:49,916
Please don't take
my pledge so lightly!

367
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,916
Hurt my delicate
feelings, it does!

368
00:23:25,291 --> 00:23:27,583
[AINS] I thought they'd
promote us to orichalcum,

369
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:29,833
but I suppose this will do.

370
00:23:29,916 --> 00:23:32,541
[NARBERAL]
Their insolence knows no bounds.

371
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:34,041
[AINS]
It's fine, Nabe.

372
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:36,666
As we speak, the surviving
soldiers are spreading

373
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:40,000
the tale of my strength and
valor to everyone in E-Rantel.

374
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:41,791
The boost that will
give to my status makes

375
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:44,375
getting mythril rank
a moot point.

376
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:46,916
Very well.

377
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,500
What should we do about
the boy and his grandmother?

378
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:51,958
[AINS] Since Lizzy said that
she would give me everything,

379
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:54,875
I'll have her and Nphiera
move to Carne Village.

380
00:23:54,958 --> 00:23:57,291
Her skill at making
potions will serve me--

381
00:23:57,375 --> 00:24:01,958
or rather all of Nazarick--
quite well. Hm...

382
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:05,666
Oh, right. I needed
to contact Albedo.

383
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,750
--"Message."
--[beeps]

384
00:24:07,833 --> 00:24:09,083
[ALBEDO]
Lord Ains.

385
00:24:09,166 --> 00:24:11,791
I'm afraid I must report
that Shalltear Bloodfallen

386
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:14,791
has betrayed us.

387
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:16,166
[AINS]
Huh?

388
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:19,750
[AINS] While I was living
among the humans

389
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:22,916
as the adventurer, Momon,
my faithful Guardians

390
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,041
worked diligently at
their respective roles.

391
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:29,041
Shalltear Bloodfallen's job
was to collect special humans

392
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:31,916
that could use magic
and martial arts skills.

393
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
With Sebas at her side, I had
ordered her to target criminals

394
00:24:35,083 --> 00:24:36,666
and other lowlife scum.

395
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:39,833
That way, they would
be missed by no one.

396
00:24:39,916 --> 00:24:43,416
Chapter ten: "True Vampire."
