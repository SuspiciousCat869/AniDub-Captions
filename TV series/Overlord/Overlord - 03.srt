1
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:49,541
The village is burning.

00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,666
[growls]

3
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:12,416
[VILLAGER 3A groaning]

4
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:17,166
Vice Chief. These
people need help.

5
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,750
Make sure they get back
to E-Rantel safely.

6
00:01:19,833 --> 00:01:20,791
General?

7
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:22,208
What is it?

8
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:23,750
Something's wrong here.

9
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:26,583
The king ordered us to track
down and terminate the bandits

10
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:29,333
that have been attacking
villages, right?

11
00:01:29,416 --> 00:01:30,458
That's correct.

12
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:32,000
Okay.

13
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:34,708
Then, why did they send us out
here with only 50 soldiers?

14
00:01:34,791 --> 00:01:37,458
Especially when Baharuth
might be responsible?

15
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:40,458
[GAZEF]
It's a top-secret operation.

16
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:42,500
You know who's behind this.

17
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:46,083
The noblemen want you to fail.

18
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:49,125
If they can remove the
King's most trusted general,

19
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:52,000
then they would have a
clear path to the throne.

20
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:53,291
It's so transparent!

21
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:55,125
That's enough, Vice Chief.

22
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:57,208
But, sir, you know
I'm telling the truth.

23
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:58,916
We're walking straight
into a trap.

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,375
Our forces should head back
to E-Rantel as fast as possible.

25
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:05,500
If we split up now,
it will only weaken us.

26
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,750
A few villages may be lost.

27
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:09,875
That is a small price
to pay in order to keep

28
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:12,875
the most powerful swordsman
in the country alive.

29
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:16,208
[gasps]

30
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:19,083
[GAZEF]
I was born a commoner.

31
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:20,875
[VICE CHIEF]
So was I.

32
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:23,583
I know what it's like to
live in these villages.

33
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:27,791
To fear monsters at every turn,
always waiting for death.

34
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:29,291
Same here.

35
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:31,625
Then you know what
it's like to have hope,

36
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:33,791
praying that someone
out there would actually

37
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:35,541
show up to protect you.

38
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:37,333
Of course, I wished
every single day

39
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:38,750
that a hero would arrive.

40
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:41,791
But, in the end, not
one person ever came.

41
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:44,916
Then let us be the
ones who do show up.

42
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:50,333
We'll let these people know
that it's okay to have hope.

43
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:55,000
That prayers are answered.
That heroes exist.

44
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:35,000
[AINS]
Hm...

45
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:41,916
[MOMONGA] I just need
to figure out how to work

46
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,541
this Mirror of Remote Viewing.

47
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:48,291
Then we can really secure the
surrounding area of Nazarick.

48
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,958
[clapping]

49
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:57,750
Congratulations, my lord.
I knew you'd do it.

50
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:01,041
[AINS] Thanks, Sebas.
I appreciate your support.

51
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:04,083
Of course. That is my duty
as your personal butler.

52
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:06,541
The sole reason I was
created by Lord Touch Me

53
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,083
was to carry out your orders.

54
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,250
No matter how tedious
they might seem.

55
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:11,708
[AINS]
Very well.

56
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:14,875
Let's see what's happening
in this new world of ours.

57
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:21,041
[AINS]
Hm. A town festival?

58
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:23,541
No. Definitely not.

59
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:36,375
[AINS] Hm. Those men don't
appear to be bandits.

60
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:48,250
[AINS grunts]

61
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:49,833
[MOMONGA]
What's up with me?

62
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,250
How can I watch this
violence so calmly?

63
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:53,958
I would have passed out
at the mere sight of it

64
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:55,708
in the real world.

65
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:58,833
[AINS gasps]

66
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:03,625
[SEBAS]
What are your orders?

67
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,000
[AINS]
Leave them be.

68
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:09,041
I see no good reason to
interfere in their affairs.

69
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:11,250
As you wish, my lord.

70
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,375
[MOMONGA]
Touch Me?

71
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:17,791
[PLAYER 1B]
What an easy encounter.

72
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,416
[PLAYER 1D] Just two more
XP and I get to level up.

73
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,291
[PLAYER 1E] Then stop goofing
around and kill him already.

74
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:22,583
[MOMONGA grunts]

75
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:23,791
[PLAYER 1E]
Damn inhuman.

76
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:25,875
[PLAYER 1D]
I'll fix his mug.

[MOMONGA gasps]

78
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,750
[MOMONGA]
Why did you save me?

79
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:42,000
[TOUCH ME] Because saving
a person who's in trouble

80
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:45,458
is always the right thing to do!

81

[AINS chuckles]

82
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:56,291
[MOMONGA] I guess that now
is as good a time as any

83
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,541
to test my strength
in this new world.

84
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:00,833
I'd have to do it
eventually anyway.

85
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:07,458
[AINS]
Sebas. I'm paying them a visit.

86
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,916
Raise the security level
of Nazarick to maximum

87
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,291
while I'm away.

88
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:13,958
[AINS]
Tell Albedo to meet me there,

89
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:17,708
armed and ready for battle.
Then prepare the reserves.

90
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:20,166
I want soldiers who are skilled
at stealth, or can use

91
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:24,291
the "Invisibility" spell, ready
to move in at a moment's notice.

00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:26,166
[SEBAS]
Consider it done.

93
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,750
[MOMONGA] I will strive to live
by your example, Touch Me.

Run, Enri! Quickly! Take Nemu!

to save my little sister.

What is that?

[MOMONGA]
Well, that's a relief.

109
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I was afraid that ninth
tier undead spell wasn't

110
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:34,708
going to work on these humans
and I'd have to retreat.

111
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:36,416
I could always use
my melee armor,

112
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,833
but I'd like to save
it for another day.

00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,208
[KNIGHT 3A]
It's a monster!

[MOMONGA] Hm. I felt nothing
after killing that soldier.

115
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,416
Interesting.

116
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,083
It seems as if I've
stopped being human

117
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:52,000
in both a physical
and a mental capacity.

Well, I'm here now.

only a weak fifth tier spell.

an undead. Death Knight!

[MOMONGA] Whoa! It's
taking over a dead body?

129
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,333
It didn't work like
that in Yggdrasil.

U-Uh...

[MOMONGA] I need to think my
orders through from now on.

137
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,375
What's the point of summoning
a defensive monster

if I'm just gonna send him away?

139

[ALBEDO] It took longer
than expected to get here.

on time, Albedo.

[ALBEDO] Thank you for
saying so. Now then.

deal with these pathetic

are the enemies we are after.

I understand.

What the hell is going on?

155
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:41,708
Did they forget I just
saved their lives?

156
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,375
Why don't they trust me?

[AINS] Albedo, don't!
Lower your weapon at once.

160
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:52,125
[ALBEDO]
As you wish, my lord.

161
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:55,625
[AINS] This is not blood.
It's a healing potion.

162
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:03,458
Wow.

163
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:05,000
[AINS]
I assume the pain is gone now?

164
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:06,916
[ENRI]
Yes, it is.

165
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,333
[AINS] Hm. Tell me, have you
ever heard of magic before?

166
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:12,666
Uh, yes.

167
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,083
I have a friend who
frequents our village.

168
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:17,541
He's a pharmacist
who practices magic.

169
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:20,416
[AINS] Perfect. Then it's
not hard to understand.

170
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,541
I am a magical caster as well.

171
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:28,000
"Anti-Life Cocoon."
"Protection from Arrows Wall."

172
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:31,708
[AINS] I just cast two
protection spells around you.

173
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,416
You'll both be safe
as long as you stay put.

174
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,708
But, just in case,
take these, as well.

175
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:40,458
If you blow the horns, an
army of goblins will appear

176
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:42,958
to do your bidding.

177
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:46,125
Do not hesitate to
use them if needed.

178
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,666
[ENRI]
Excuse me!

179
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:53,000
Thank you so much for saving us.
We are forever grateful.

180
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:55,000
Thank you very much, Mister!

181
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,625

It was no problem.

00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:57,958
Uh, wait!

183
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:00,083
May I please have the name
of the man who saved me?

184
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:01,833
[AINS]
My name?

185
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:05,708
[MOMONGA]
Yes. They should all know.

186
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,625
[AINS]
You shall remember it well.

187
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:11,333
And tell everyone of my powers.

188
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:14,541

It is a pleasure

Don't worry about

No harm will come to you now.

I mean, owner of my kindness.

However, next time you commit
such heinous acts in this area,

249
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:27,208
I will bring death
to your entire kingdom.

250
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:30,625
Leave. Make sure you speak
my name to everyone.

[KNIGHTS scream]

Acting is a tough gig.

253
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:37,458
[VILLAGE CHIEF]
Uh, pardon me, sir.

254
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:38,208
[AINS]
Hm?

255
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:40,583
Why did you come here?

256
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:42,916
[AINS] I could not stand by
and watch innocent people

257
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,208
be murdered. Call it
a "moral obligation."

258
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:47,625
[VILLAGERS gasp]

259
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:50,333
[AINS] Be at ease. This village
is under my protection.

260
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,958
You no longer need to be scared.

261
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:57,875
[VILLAGERS gasp]

262
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,000
[AINS sighs]

263
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:02,791
[AINS] I don't do this kind
of work for free though.

264
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:05,666
I expect to be compensated
for my efforts.

265
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:09,541
[VILLAGERS murmur, laugh]

266
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,291
[MOMONGA] As I thought,
the villagers don't question

267
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:13,291
my intentions as long as
they think I'm doing this

268
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,625
for financial gain.

269
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,375
They would react
negatively if they saw

270
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:21,125
my real face, even though
it was common in Yggdrassil.

271
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:22,791
It's too bad I didn't
think of concealing it

272
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,958
before stepping in
to this situation.

273
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:27,250
It's a pain, but I'll
have to use a spell

274
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:29,791
to keep those girls quiet.

275
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:31,333
Here's hoping
memory-wiping magic

276
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:33,166
works in this place.

277
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:37,083
[AINS] I requested money
from the village so as

278
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:39,250
not to arouse any suspicions.

279
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:42,208
But information was
what I was truly after.

280
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:44,000
I am unfamiliar
with this new world

281
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:46,958
and need to learn all
I can about the area.

282
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:49,458
Failing to educate myself
will only make me weak

283
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,000
to any enemies.

284
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:53,208
The village chief and his
wife believed my story

285
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:55,250
about being a hermit who
was quite knowledgeable

286
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:57,666
about magic, but
who knew nothing

287
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,625
of the world around him.

288
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:01,916
They were eager to educate
me about this village

289
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,250
and the surrounding areas.

290
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,208
I wonder though.

291
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,041
[MOMONGA] What kind of people
use magic in this world

292
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:11,500
that these peasants would
so easily trust me?

293
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:13,000
Even though my face is concealed

294
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:15,208
by this cursed mask, they
dropped their guard just because

295
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:17,791
I claimed to be a magic caster.

296
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,750
In Yggdrasil, even n00bs
could get this mask

297
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:22,625
by staying logged in
over Christmas Eve.

298
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,041
Sadly, I quickly learned
that all of my Yggdrasil

299
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:27,541
currency was useless here.

300
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:30,416
Of course, the gold
itself has some value,

301
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,625
but it could be dangerous
to flash the coins around.

302
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:37,166
After that, I asked about
the surrounding territories.

303
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,791
There are three realms.

304
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:40,875
Nazarick, and this village,
known as Carne,

305
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:43,958
are part of the
Re-Estize Kingdom border.

306
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:46,333
On the other side of
said border is the domain

307
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:47,833
adjacent to the
great mountain range

308
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:52,166
that runs north and south.
The Baharuth Empire.

309
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,375
The two countries are on
bad terms to say the least.

310
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:57,625
They've hated each other for
years and they often battle

311
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:59,250
on the open plains
between them near

312
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:02,833
the capital city of E-Rantel.

313
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,958
There is one final country.

314
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:08,166
The Slane Theocracy, which
is located to the south

315
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:11,000
of both provinces.

316
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:13,375
The village chief assumed
the Baharuth Empire

317
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:15,500
was responsible for
the attack based on

318
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,625
the crests of the
Knight's shields.

319
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:19,500
However, there's
a possibility that

320
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:22,666
the Slane Theocracy staged this
event to maintain hostilities

321
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:25,833
between Re-Estize and Baharuth.

322
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:27,375
If I had thought to
take a knight hostage

323
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,208
for questioning, we
would have found out

324
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:31,333
for sure who was responsible.

325
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:33,291
Is there something
bothering you?

326
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:35,625
[AINS]
No. Everything is fine.

327
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:37,208
Is there anything
else of importance

328
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:38,875
that I should know
about this region?

329
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:40,375
[VILLAGE CHIEF]
Let's see.

330
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:43,625
The closest city to our village
is the capital, E-Rantel.

331
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:46,125
Goblins, orcs and ogres
inhabit the area.

332
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,500
But you should be safe
if you stay on the road.

333
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:50,416
The adventurers
hunt on that land

334
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,416
and do a good job of
keeping those bastards'

335
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,000
populations in check.

336
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:55,208
[AINS]
Adventurers?

337
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:56,833
They're mercenaries
who deal with

338
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:59,083
monsters in exchange
for payment.

339
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:00,791
If you're interested in
hiring some of them,

340
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:03,000
there's a guild in
E-Rantel where you can

341
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:04,583
request their services.

342
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:06,958
[AINS]
An Adventurer's Guild?

343
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:09,875
And just how big of
a city is E-Rantel?

344
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:11,041
I'm not sure.

345
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:13,125
Definitely larger
than our village.

346
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:15,291
[AINS]
I suspected that.

347
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:16,625
[MOMONGA]
If I want to find out more,

348
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:19,708
I'll have to make a home
for myself in the capital.

349
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,916
[AINS] I could use my
Wand of Resurrection.

350
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,250
It would breathe life back
into the dead villagers.

351
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,625
However, these people
may not be as trusting

352
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,916
of a magic user who's
as good at reversing death

353
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,375
as he is at bringing it.

354
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:39,000
I can only imagine
how much trouble

355
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:41,333
I'd get myself into
if I cast it.

356
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:42,916
[ENRI, NEMU sobbing]

357
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,041
[AINS]
For now, I'll restrain myself.

358
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:46,625
They should all be
content with the fact

359
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,750
that I saved their village.

360
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:54,875
[MOMONGA] Thanks to my good
deed, the story of how

361
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:57,166
Ains Ooal Gown saved
Carne Village will spread

362
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,541
across the countryside.

363
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:01,916
My reputation
should grow quickly.

364
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,625
And if there are other
players from Yggdrasil

365
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:04,875
stuck in this world,

366
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:07,083
they will hopefully hear
of me and seek me out.

367
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:10,083
I shouldn't kill any more
humans unless necessary.

368
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:13,666
I wouldn't wanna
antagonize any players.

369
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:17,250
Also. A man with a
reputation needs a cause.

370
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:18,708
One that would allow
me to win the support

371
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:21,500
of one of the countries.

372
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:24,083
[MOMONGA sighs]
I'm exhausted.

373
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:26,458
[AINS] Today's mission
was a great success.

374
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:28,500
Let's head back home, Albedo.

375
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:29,625
[ALBEDO]
Right away, my lord.

376
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:32,541
[VILLAGER 3D panting]
Hey there.

377
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,500
[AINS]
You seem to dislike humans.

378
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:37,000
[ALBEDO]
What's to like about them?

379
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:39,125
They are weak and pathetic.

380
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:43,125
Just tiny insects that exist
to be crushed under foot.

381
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,500
[AINS]
Listen to me.

382
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:47,791
I want you to show them
respect. Act if you need to.

383
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:51,250
But I demand that you treat
the humans with kindness.

384
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,416
[ALBEDO grunts]

385
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:56,333
[MOMONGA] It feels hypocritical
to ask that of her

386
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:58,583
when I don't have
feelings for them either.

387
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:01,291
Must be a side effect
from being an undead.

388
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:03,916
What are we going to do, Chief?

389
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,125
I'm afraid I don't have a plan.

390
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:08,708
[AINS]
The problems keep stacking up.

391
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:11,458
Village Chief. Is there
something wrong here?

392
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:13,333
Lord Ains! Thank goodness!

393
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:15,083
I was just told
there are more soldiers

394
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:17,875
heading toward the village
at breakneck speed.

395
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,666
[AINS]
Is that so?

396
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:24,333
[AINS] Don't worry, I can
handle this situation.

397
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:27,458
Please gather the surviving
villagers around your house.

When you're done, come
meet me at the town square.

Yes, of course.

that have been attacking

Are you the chief

Who is this man
standing beside you?

He looks peculiar.

It is a pleasure to make
your acquaintance, General.

My name is Ains Ooal Gown.

I'm a simple magic user

while it was being
ransacked by those knights.

What?

been lost without you.

Huh?

423
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:36,583
We've spotted a large army

424
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:38,125
of unknown origin,
and they're surrounding

425
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:40,958
the village even as we speak!

[MOMONGA gasps]

427

[AINS] The Slane Theocracy's
special ops unit

00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,958
carried out the attack
on Carne Village

429
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:23,916
in order to draw out Gazef,

Though he's aware of the trap,
Gazef bravely attacks the enemy

in order to protect
the villagers.
