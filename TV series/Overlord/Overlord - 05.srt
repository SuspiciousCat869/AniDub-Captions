1
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,750
[ALBEDO] Aura's report
states that there has been

2
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:42,083
no contact from any
other Yggdrasil players

3
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:43,666
in our immediate vicinity.

4
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,250
But she is expanding
her surveillance

5
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:47,375
to the great woodlands
near Nazarick.

6
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:49,333
Hopefully, she'll have
better luck there.

7
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:51,583
If they're out there,
she'll find them.

8
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:54,958
Also, I have information
from the man we captured.

9
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:57,541
He's from the Slane
Theocracy and commands

10
00:00:57,625 --> 00:01:00,166
their special ops unit.

11
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,875
[AINS]
The Slane Theocracy.

12
00:01:02,958 --> 00:01:05,666
It's a theocratic nation
that wishes to unite humans

13
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,291
against all other races.

14
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:09,500
If given the chance,
they'd wipe out the entire

15
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:12,416
population of ogres,
goblins and lizardmen.

16
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,333
I believe it would be
too dangerous to have

17
00:01:14,416 --> 00:01:16,333
any contact with them now.

18
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:17,791
There's one last thing.

19
00:01:17,875 --> 00:01:20,708
What should we do about
the people we saved?

20
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:22,708
[AINS] Don't do anything that
would make the citizens

21
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:25,291
of Carne Village see us
in a negative light.

22
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:27,166
We gained that foothold
on friendly terms

23
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,625
and I want it to stay that way.

24
00:01:29,708 --> 00:01:31,750
Understood, master. That's it.

25
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:34,916
There is nothing left to
discuss from the daily report.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,250
[AINS]
Good job.

27
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:39,916
I am unworthy of such
praise. You are too kind.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,041
I need you to take me
right here and now.

29
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:45,458
Please, do whatever you
want to me, my love.

30
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:48,375
[AINS] Albedo. I'm not going
to take advantage of you.

31
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:51,166
I programmed you to have
these feelings towards me.

32
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,333
That's all.

33
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:54,541
I honestly don't see
what the problem is.

34
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:55,291
[AINS]
Ah?

35
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:56,583
Tell me something.

36
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:59,375
Are you truly disturbed
by my feelings?

37
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:01,833
Is my love a burden, master?

38
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:04,166
[AINS]
No. That's not it at all.

39
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,375
Wonderful.

40
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,166
Our relationship can
move to the next level.

41
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,458
[AINS]
Uh...

42
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:11,500
I'm so happy that we both
agree on this issue.

43
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:12,833
[AINS]
But I messed with the settings

44
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:14,666
Tabula designed for you.

45
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,291
[ALBEDO]
Lord Tabula wouldn't mind.

46
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:18,000
After all, I'm like
a daughter to him.

47
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:21,541
He'd be happy to know that I
found true love after he left.

48
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:23,916
[AINS]
You really believe that?

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,416
Uh-huh.

50
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,541
[knocking]

51
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:31,166
[SHALLTEAR]
Lord Ains.

52
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,958
I hope you are doing well
on this beautiful day.

53
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:37,541
[AINS] I am doing very well,
as I hope you are, Shalltear.

54
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:39,541
Is there something
I can help you with?

55
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:40,916
Oh, no.

56
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,791
My day has already been
improved just by laying eyes

57
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:44,541
on your exquisite form, my lord.

58
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:46,750
Well, if that's all
you needed, why don't you

59
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,083
go bother someone else?

60
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:49,791
Lord Ains and I are
busy right now,

61
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:52,416
and your pathetic flirting
has interrupted us.

62
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,291
Shriveled old ladies
can be such a bore,

63
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,708
don't you think? They cling
to whomever they can

64
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:58,125
because they've
passed their prime.

65
00:02:58,208 --> 00:02:59,666
You're trying to
pass yourself off

66
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,208
as young and perky.
But I know the truth about

67
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:05,000
your two little friends
that have suddenly appeared.

68
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:08,000
It's pitiful, stuffing your bra.

69
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:09,833
I will rip your hag face off!

70
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:12,666
Remind me, which one of
us is a walking cadaver?

71
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,583
[SHALLTEAR growls]

72
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:15,000
[AINS]
Knock it off, you two!

73
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:17,208
You're acting like children.

74
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:19,375
[ALBEDO, SHALLTEAR]
Sorry, Lord Ains.

75
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:22,208
[AINS]
Well? Why are you really here?

76
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:23,750
Right.

77
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:25,916
I'm getting ready to depart
for my assignment with Sebas.

78
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,208
As I understand it, we may
be away from Nazarick

79
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,791
for quite a while.

80
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:32,041
I wanted to make sure
I said a proper goodbye

81
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:34,875
to my lord before
I make my exit.

82
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:38,000
And I couldn't leave
without one last look at you.

83
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:26,875
[MEN]
Hm?

84
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,125
[MAN 5C]
Hm?

85
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:40,875
[BRITTA]
Huh?

86
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:47,541
Need a room?

87
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:50,041
Cost ya five bronze pieces
each. Meals are gonna--

88
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:52,500
[AINS]
I only need one room, thanks.

89
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:54,000
Forget the meals.

90
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:56,625
[SHOPKEEPER 5A] Hm? Oh, you're
a low level copper plate.

91
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:58,083
This place is gonna
be too expensive--

92
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,958
[AINS]
It's our first time registering.

93
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:03,791
Unfortunately, they make
you start at copper.

94
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:07,666
Now it's seven bronze pieces.
Payment due up front.

95
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,416
[AINS]
That's not a problem.

96
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:14,000
The room is upstairs
in the back.

97
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,916
[AINS]
Hm?

98
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:21,791
[THUGS chuckle]

99
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:23,583
[AINS]
Hilarious.

00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:26,916
[THUG 5A]
Hey!

101
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,541
Watch where you're
going, you big oaf.

102
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:32,791
How can I work with
a busted ankle? Hm?

103
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,375
Lookie here.

104
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:37,875
Perhaps your little vixen can
kiss it and make me feel better.

105
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:41,541
[AINS laughs]
Not even in your dreams.

106
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:42,875
[THUG 5A]
Hm?

107
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:44,625
[AINS] Your uncivilized
behavior is quite amusing.

108
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,250
I can't help but laugh.

109
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:47,875
What?

110
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:49,083
[gags]

111
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:51,666
[AINS]
Look at that.

112
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,375
You're not so funny when
you can't breathe, are you?

113
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:55,833
Weakling.

114

[gasps]

116
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,375
[AINS] So? Does anyone else
have something humorous

117
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:06,583
they want to say about
my companion? Because I--

118
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:10,666
[BRITTA screams]

119
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,416
[BRITTA]
I cannot believe this!

120
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,083
What the hell, man?!

121
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:15,500
You just spilled my potion

122
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:19,041
all over the floor back there.
It wasn't cheap y'know!

123
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:20,458
[AINS]
Potion?

124
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,041
[BRITTA]
Yeah, that's right.

125
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:24,541
Do you have any idea how long
I've been waiting to buy that?

126
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:26,333
I had to skip meals
and stop drinking

127
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:28,291
until I could afford
it. Took months!

128
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:31,541
You better pay for it,
or things are gonna get ugly.

129
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:32,791
[AINS]
Excuse me.

130
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,791
But I believe these men
should reimburse you.

131
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:37,625
You really think these
drunks can pay me back?

132
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:41,041
I doubt they've ever seen a
piece of gold in their life.

133
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,416
You on the other hand.

134
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,333
You're wearing some
expensive looking armor

135
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:47,291
and I'm betting you have a
healing potion or two in there.

136
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:49,875
I'd be happy with
getting one of those.

--[AINS] Actually, I do.

[AINS]
Uh--

139
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:54,208
Wait! Wait!

140
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:55,916
Here you go.

141
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,666
[BRITTA]
A red potion?

142
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,208
[AINS]
That makes us even, right?

143
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:06,791
Sure. For now.

144
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:10,250
Lord Ains. You
shouldn't have to stay

145
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:14,208
in such a small
and disgusting place.

146
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:16,125
[AINS]
It's not that bad, Narberal.

147
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:19,125
But the guild doesn't seem
to set any member standards.

148
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:21,916
Hopefully, all adventurers
don't act like hooligans.

149
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,500
Then again, when you're
fighting monsters,

150
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:26,083
brains aren't much
of a requirement.

151
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:27,625
What are we going
to do about the woman

152
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:29,208
who took your potion?

153
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:31,333
[AINS] As an iron level
adventurer, she currently

154
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:34,916
outranks us in this city.
It's best to let her be for now.

155
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,541
We'll deal with her
later in private.

156
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:39,958
I am curious about something.

157
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:41,625
What are your
thoughts on humans?

158
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,125
Complete garbage.

159
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:45,125
[MOMONGA]
Seriously? Her, too?

160
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:46,666
[AINS]
Narberal.

161
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,750
I can't order you to change
your feelings towards humans.

162
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,708
But I need you to
control your hostility

163
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:52,541
while you're in public.

164
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:55,125
If you wish, then, I will try.

165
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:56,875
[AINS]
Oh, and don't call me Ains.

166
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:59,000
Remember, I'm Momon
in this city.

167
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:00,583
Of course, Lord Momon.

168
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,000
[AINS]
It's just Momon!

169
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,666
And I will no longer
call you Narberal Gamma.

170
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,375
You are now Momon's
partner. Nabe.

171
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:10,958
Sorry, I won't forget
again, Momon... sir?

172
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:12,666
[AINS]
That's still a bit too formal.

173
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,291
But it'll work for now.

174
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,666
Anyway, we should discuss
our plan of action

175
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,125
while in E-Rantel.

176
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:18,875
[NARBERAL]
Yes!

177
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,708
[AINS]
Uh-- Okay then.

178
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:24,708
Our main objective in
this city is to gather

179
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:27,916
knowledge about this new world
we've been transported to.

180
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,083
In order to obtain
said information,

181
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:33,291
we will go undercover as
low-level adventurers.

182
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:36,166
We will gain experience
by completing quests.

183
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,416
With our skills, we should
quickly reach the highest

184
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,625
ranks of mythril,
orichalcum and adamantite.

185
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:44,041
Once there, we will be
assigned harder quests

186
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:47,166
which should allow us to
access the most useful intel.

187
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,791
Flawless plan,
my lord. I'm in awe.

188
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:52,291
[AINS]
It's Momon! But you're wrong.

189
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:56,666
There is one problem.
Our currency is worthless!

190
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,916
The majority of our money
is gold from Yggdrasil.

191
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,250
We can't use it.

192
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,541
It would be publicly
announcing that we came from

193
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:04,875
somewhere else.

194
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:06,791
And, if there are other
players that happen to be

195
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,291
living in this city,

196
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:09,958
there is no guarantee
that they would be

197
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:11,583
friendly towards us.

198
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:15,916
Therefore, our first goal is
to make ourselves some money!

199
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,250
Let's find a job!

200
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,708
[NPHIREA]
Welcome!

201
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:35,583
Ah... Are you
Mr. Nphirea Balear?

202
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:38,791
Yes. And how may I
help you today, Miss?

203
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:41,541
I need you to appraise
a potion for me.

204
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:46,500
[door creaks]

205
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:47,208
[NPHIREA]
Grandma!

206
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:49,000
[LIZZY]
Hm?

207
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,333
[NPHIREA]
You've gotta see this!

208
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:54,708
[LIZZY]
Hm? It's red.

209
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:55,958
What do you know about it?

210
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:58,541
First, I need to
examine it properly.

211
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:02,375
[BRITTA] So this is Lizzy
Balear, the famous pharmacist?

212
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:05,958
She's the best there is.
Though, I may be biased.

213
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:08,666
I'll use my Appraise
Magical Item spell.

214
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,083
It should detect
any enchantments.

215
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:12,708
[gasps]

216
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:14,958
So? What's up with it?

217
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,625
[LIZZY laughs]

218
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:17,916
Huh?

219
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,833
Tell me, Nphirea.

220
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:22,208
The modern manufacturing
process causes

221
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:24,958
all potions to
turn blue, correct?

222
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:25,958
[NPHIREA]
That's right.

223
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:26,958
[LIZZY]
Well, this--

224
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:28,666
I've never seen
anything like it.

225
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:32,416
It's made of pure magic like
something from a fairytale.

226
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,333
"A true potion of
healing resembles

227
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:37,083
the color of God's own blood."

228
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:40,125
I never believed
it actually existed.

229
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:42,083
You are one lucky lady.

230
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:44,541
This is equal to a second
tier healing spell.

231
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:47,041
Easily worth eight gold pieces.

232
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:49,625
But there are risks with
having such a rare item.

233
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,500
There are people out
there who would kill

234
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:54,291
to get their hands on
a potion this powerful.

235
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:55,083
Huh?

236
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:56,458
I can help though.

237
00:11:56,541 --> 00:12:00,416
You wouldn't have to worry
if you sold it to me.

238
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,333
But I...

239
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:02,458
[LIZZY]
Hm?

240
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:04,166
Uh...

241
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,500
[LIZZY sighs]

242
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:09,416
All right. I have another
proposition for you.

243
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,000
Ah?

244
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:16,666
[ADVENTURER 5A]
Wow. Check out that guy's armor.

245
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:17,916
Looks quite expensive.

246
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,250
And he's just a copper plate.

247
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:21,000
[ADVENTURER 5A] Typical
rich kid playing pretend.

248
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,750
[ADVENTURER 5B]
A shiny present from Daddy.

249
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,541
[ADVENTURERS laugh]

250
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:27,625
[MOMONGA] This is bad.
I can't read these postings.

251
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:31,375
And Narberal isn't able
to read any language.

252
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:32,916
Hm.

253
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:37,208
[AINS]
Consider this quest done.

254
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:38,833
I'm very sorry, sir.

255
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:40,125
But you are only a copper plate

256
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:42,083
and this request is
looking for a mythril.

257
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:43,916
[AINS]
I'm aware.

258
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,166
You'll find me
more than qualified.

259
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,166
I have to follow
the guild's rules.

260
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,833
[AINS]
The rules are wrong.

261
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:52,000
Guidelines are set for a reason.

262
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:53,583
Without the
requisite experience,

263
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:55,458
you could get
someone hurt or worse.

264
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:59,250
[AINS]
Hah. You see my companion here?

265
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:01,500
She's a third tier magic user.

266
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:02,750
[ADVENTURER 5D]
Third tier?

267
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,708
[ADVENTURER 5E]
There's no way!

268
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:07,833
[AINS] I have the skills of
a fighter comperable to her.

269
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,416
It would be a waste
of our talents

270
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:13,041
to accept a mere
copper plate quest.

271
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,750
I understand, but the
rules are very clear.

272
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:18,291
I simply can't allow it.

273
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:21,875
[AINS] No problem.
You're just doing your job.

274
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:25,166
Sorry if we came
across as pompous.

275
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,375
Please sign us up for
the most difficult quest

276
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,666
available in the
copper plate field.

277
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,833
Yes. Of course.

278
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:32,208
Give me just a moment.

279
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:34,500
[MOMONGA] Perfect! I can't
believe that worked.

280
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:36,958
[PETER]
Hey, Mister, you two could join

281
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:38,833
our adventuring group
if you're interested.

282
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:40,750
[AINS]
Really?

283
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,000
[PETER]
Let me introduce everyone.

284
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:48,458
We call ourselves
The Swords of Darkness.

285
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,083
I'm Peter Mork, the leader.

286
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:52,458
Over to my left is our
ranger, Lukrut Volve.

287
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,250
He's our eyes and
ears in the field.

288
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,583
Ha, hi!

289
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:57,833
[PETER] Our capable Druid
uses magic to heal us

290
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:01,708
and manipulate nature.
Dyne Woodwonder.

291
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:03,750
Nice to meet you folks.

292
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:06,291
And last but not least is
the brains of the operation.

293
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:09,333
Our magic user,
Ninya the Spell Caster.

294
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:12,083
Hello there. Peter, stop it.

295
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:14,791
I keep telling you that
nickname is embarrassing.

296
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:15,833
Why?

297
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:17,125
You know you should
be proud of it.

298
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:19,000
Our Ninya here
is a talent holder.

299
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:21,458
[AINS]
Seriously? That's impressive.

300
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:23,333
[MOMONGA] In this world,
that means he was born

301
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:25,250
with a special ability.

302
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,708
Ninya has a talent
called Magic Affinity.

303
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:29,916
He's able to learn magic
spells twice as fast

304
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,916
as the average caster.
Isn't that right?

305
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,833
Uh...

306
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:34,458
[AINS]
That's amazing.

307
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:37,000
It's not like I did
anything to deserve this.

308
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:38,541
I'm lucky.

309
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:41,083
Part of me feels it's actually
kind of an unfair advantage.

310
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:43,833
Such modesty. He's a
famous talent holder.

311
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,666
We're proud to have
him on our team.

312
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,125
Yeah, well.

313
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:49,416
Here in E-Rantel, there's a
more famous talent holder.

314
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,125
That would be Master Balear.

315
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:53,458
[AINS]
Who? Oh, how rude of me.

316
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:55,791
This is Nabe and I am Momon.

317
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:58,208
Glad to have you all
watching our backs.

318
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:01,041
So. About this Balear guy.

319
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:03,333
What kind of talent
does he possess?

320
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:04,916
You don't know?

321
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
There's absolutely no way you
guys are from around here then,

322
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:08,750
and that actually
explains a lot.

323
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:11,958
[AINS] You're correct.
We just arrived yesterday.

324
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:15,041
Well, his name
is Nphirea Balear.

325
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:18,250
He's the grandson of a well
known pharmacist in E-Rantel.

326
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:20,375
He was born with a talent
that allows him to use

327
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:23,250
any and all magical
items without training.

328
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:24,250
[AINS]
Impressive.

329
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:26,291
That could be useful.

330
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:27,583
[AINS]
Agreed.

331
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:28,916
Now then.

332
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,666
I'm sure you're wondering
why we need your help.

333
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,083
Our current objective is
to destroy all the monsters

334
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,166
that have wandered
too close to the city.

335
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,291
[AINS]
You were hired to hunt monsters?

336
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:38,375
Not really.

337
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:40,125
It's actually an
off-the-books expedition

338
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:42,458
that we decided to
take on by ourselves.

339
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,000
[AINS]
What does that mean?

340
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:45,583
We weren't exactly
hired to do it,

341
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:47,458
but the guild will receive
money from the city

342
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:49,916
based on the strength
of the monsters we defeat.

343
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,416
We just have to collect
our reward from the guild.

344
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,750
[MOMONGA]
I get it.

345
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:56,166
It's like earning coins
by collecting item drops.

346
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,291
It's a dull, but necessary
task for us adventurers.

347
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,958
The job is pretty easy,
and we get to keep people safe,

348
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:04,416
while also bringing
home the tasty bacon.

349
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,750
It's totally a win-win situation
for all parties involved.

350
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,750
So, you interested
in joining us?

351
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:11,416
Our plan is to start
clearing out the forest

352
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,375
just south of the city and
working our way north.

353
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:15,875
Whaddya say?

354
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:18,041
The experience will help you
rise above a copper plate.

355
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,750
[AINS]
Sure. We're happy to come along.

356
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:22,083
[ADVENTURERS laugh]

357
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:24,875
[AINS] One thing. I should
show you all my face

358
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:27,041
since we will be
working together.

359
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:29,083
I hope it's not a shock.

360
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:33,833
Oh, interesting.
I've heard of a country

361
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:35,958
south of here where a face
like yours is common,

362
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:38,000
but you're the first
that I've met in person.

363
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,500
He's older than I expected.

364
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:40,958
Don't be so rude.

365
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,583
[AINS] I've been hiding my
face since we came to town.

366
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:46,000
Sometimes people have
issues with foreigners.

367
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:48,791
And I didn't want to
stir up any trouble.

368
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:52,166
[MOMONGA] They have no clue
this face is an illusion.

369
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,500
[LUKRUT]
Just out of curiosity,

370
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,458
what kind of partners
are you two exactly?

371
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:56,708
[NINYA, PETER, DYNE groan]

372
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:57,958
[AINS]
We're allies.

373
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:00,250
That's wonderful.
'Cause I'm in love!

374
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:01,625
Say you'll go on a date with me?

375
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:03,208
Watch your tongue, you dog.

376
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,791
Or I shall have to cut it out
and serve it to you for dinner.

377
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:07,375
Learn your place and sit.

378
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:08,916
[AINS]
She doesn't mean--

379
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,458
[LUKRUT] That kind of honest
criticism is so rare these days!

380
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:13,958
You're right. We should just
start as friends, for now.

381
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:15,416
You disgust me.

382
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,708
Perhaps I'll spoon out
your eyes for fun.

383
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:22,000
[LUKRUT] That cool gaze of
hers really does it for me.

384
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,333
I'm sorry about
my friend's advances.

385
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:27,416
[AINS]
Yes. I'm sorry as well.

386
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:29,958
If you and Nabe are ready to go,

387
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:32,208
I think it's best that
we head out immediately.

388
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:33,208
[AINS]
Agreed.

[AINS]
Hm?

391
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:39,291
Someone specifically
requested you for a job.

392
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:41,166
[AINS]
Do you know who asked for me?

393
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,041
Yes, Mr. Nphirea Balear.

[growls]

[AINS]
Stop and think before you act.

I'm sorry. It won't
happen again.

[AINS]
I know you mean well.

399
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:56,666
But you have to learn
not to overreact

400
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,541
to harmless
situations. Understand?

401

[NPHIREA]
Hello there.

402
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:03,541
I'm the one that
specifically requested you.

403
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,375
[AINS]
I'm sorry to disappoint.

404
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:08,041
But we have already
accepted another position.

405
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,958
Perhaps after we have finished
this job we can help you.

406
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:13,875
Don't be ridiculous!
This could be big for you!

[AINS] I agreed to join
up with your group.

if I did not keep my word?

[NPHIREA, QUEST-GIVER 5A gasp]

But, it's a personal request.

411
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:25,958
[AINS]
Okay. How about this:

412
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:28,208
I will listen to
Mr. Balear's proposition,

413
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:30,333
and then make my choice.

414
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:33,208
[NPHIREA]
My name is Nphirea Balear.

415
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:35,916
I'm a pharmacist
here in the city.

416
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,291
Your job would be to
protect me while I harvest

417
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:41,041
some herbs in the forest
near Carne Village.

[MOMONGA]
Carne Village?

419
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,416
Aside from escorting me
there and back again,

420
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,625
I'd like for you
to help me collect

421
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,708
the medicinal herbs that I need.

A bodyguard assignment.

00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:51,458
[MOMONGA]
I don't know about this gig.

424
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:54,875
My skills and items aren't
great at protecting others.

425
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:56,000
The reward for doing this is--

How would you like to
come on as my hired hand?

What do you mean?

I suggest we take these men

along for this excursion.

431
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:08,375
A ranger such as Mr. Lukrut
would provide security.

432
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:10,875
And it would also be smart
to have the skills of a Druid

433
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:13,958
like Mr. Dyne if we're going
to be working in a forest.

Yes. You possess a keen
insight, Mr. Momon.

I definitely don't
mind tagging along.

It'd be an honor
to escort you both.

437

More men equals more
protection for me.

[AINS]
That's settled then.

439
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:27,875
But... I'm still
confused by one thing.

440
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,041
What's that?

441
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:31,750
[AINS] Why did you
request me for this job?

Huh?

443
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:34,708

area and don't have

any acquaintances in this city.

445
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:39,041
I'm very curious how
a well-known citizen

446
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:41,500
such as yourself
came to know my name.

May I ask how you heard of me?

448
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:44,833

about what happened

Yeah.

452
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:51,041
A recent customer of
mine told me about how

453
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:53,625
you easily took down several
higher ranked adventurers

454

who were accosting you
and your partner.

The person I used
to hire as an escort

456

moved away from E-Rantel
not too long ago.

So, now I'm in the market
for a replacement warrior.

00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:04,541
And to be perfectly
honest with you,

459
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:07,750
it's a lot cheaper to hire
a copper plate for the job.

another question?

469
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,250
Are you here?

470
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:07,375
[KHAJIT] I told you
to stop calling me that.

471
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:11,416
It is disrespectful to
the great name of Zuranon.

472
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,500
So tell me. Why have
you come here?

473
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:18,000
[CLEMENTINE giggles] I thought
you might be interested in this.

474
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,208
My god.

475
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:22,000
One of the treasures
of the Slane Theocracy.

476
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:25,375
A fabled shaman princess
wore that Crown of Wisdom.

477
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:26,833
[CLEMENTINE]
Oh, I know.

478
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:30,166
A sweet little thing was
going crazy while wearing it.

479
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:34,125
So, I did her a favor and
snatched it off her pretty head.

480
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,833
[KHAJIT grunts] As a former
member of the Black Scripture,

481
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:38,791
you should be well
aware that this item

482
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:40,500
suppresses the
soul of its bearer

483
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:42,541
and turns them into
a magical conduit.

484
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:44,208
It's incredibly dangerous.

485
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:46,750
Simply touching it could
have meant your end,

486
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:48,666
and yet you did it anyway.

487
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,500
Boring.

488
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:52,250
There's a one in
a million chance

489
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:54,625
you could find a
person who's compatible.

490
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:57,083
And without a true match,
it's just a very fancy

491
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:58,500
piece of garbage.

492
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,000
That's why I came.

493
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:02,375
As a fellow member of
the society of Zuranon,

494
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:04,083
you have to help me.

495
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:07,041
Isn't that right,
Khajit Dale Badantel?

496
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:10,625
[growls] I don't answer
to "Dale" anymore.

497
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:12,541
Now, what do you want from me?

498
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:14,625
[CLEMENTINE] I've heard rumors
about a talent holder

499
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,583
in town that can use
any magical item at will.

500
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:21,000
Do you think he can make this
crown work for little ol' me?

501
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:23,041
I highly doubt that
you need my assistance

502
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:25,083
kidnapping a defenseless boy.

503
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:27,000
Normally, no, but I
intend to cause

504
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:29,125
a bit of an uproar
in the process.

505
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:30,833
You plan on using chaos

506
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:33,291
as your means
to escape the city.

507
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:34,666
How's this:

508
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,750
I'll participate in your
ritual if you're a good boy

509
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:40,166
and help me out.
Pretty enticing, right?

510
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:42,791
I'd be a fool to
turn that offer down.

511
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:46,166
Let's figure out how to
grab that talent holder.

512
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:20,041
[AINS] My first job as
the adventurer, Momon,

513
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:23,916
is to serve as bodyguard
to Nphirea, the pharmacist.

514
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,625
An adventurer group
calling themselves

515
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:28,833
"The Swords of Darkness,"
accompany me on the journey.

516
00:24:28,916 --> 00:24:30,750
And, even though their
individual specialties

517
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:34,166
are vastly different,
their teamwork is seamless.

518
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:37,208
Their strong bond reminds
me of my old comrads

519
00:24:37,291 --> 00:24:39,541
and all that we could
accomplish together.

520
00:24:39,625 --> 00:24:43,625
And the memories fill me
with jealousy and melancholy.

521
00:24:43,708 --> 00:24:45,708
Chapter six: "Journey."
