00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:46,541
My apologies, madam.

3
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:47,875
[SOLUTION]
Enough!

4
00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:50,791
I do not wish to stay here
a moment longer, Sebas.

5
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:52,666

00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,083

[SOLUTION]
Zach!

8
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:00,458
Yes, Miss?

9
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:03,083
Stop stuffing your face
and get the carriage.

10
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:05,875
I want this town at my
back within the hour.

11
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:15,541
Please, return to your meals,
ladies and gentlemen.

12

[knocking]

13
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,458
Excuse me, Miss.

14
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:29,916
I'm afraid I took the
performance too far.

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,333
Please, forgive me.

16
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:34,000
There is no need to lower
your head to me, Solution.

17
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:36,083
I am supposed to be
your butler for as long

18
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:37,708
as we continue this charade.

19
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:40,208
Yes, that is true
for this mission.

20
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:42,375
However, as a member of
the Pleiades, I am your

21
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:46,500
subordinate first and
foremost, Master Sebas.

22
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:49,250
Well, Lady Shalltear has
most certainly grown anxious

23
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:51,250
to play her part in all of this.

24
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:54,416
I will let her know the
time has finally come.

25
00:01:58,708 --> 00:02:02,125
By the way, is Zach
performing as we expected?

26
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:04,416
Yes, sir.

27
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,708
As we speak, he is meeting with
a filthy man in the back alley.

28

[ZACH]
She's perfect.

29
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:10,000
[SOLUTION]
They are planning to attack us

30
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:11,583
somewhere outside the city.

31
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:15,375
And use me for all manner
of unspeakable things.

32
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:17,416
I am happy to hear it.

33
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:22,041
Everything is unfolding exactly
as Lord Ains predicted.

34
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:24,291
One more thing, master.

35
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:28,041
I'd like to have that man
once he's no longer useful.

36
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:32,208
It would be best to ask
Lady Shalltear first,

37
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:34,250
but I'm sure it will be fine.

38
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:36,166
[SOLUTION]
Thank you very much.

39
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,125
And why are you
so interested in him?

40
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:42,541
[SOLUTION] He thinks he will
get to enjoy a piece of me.

41
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:45,875
So, I thought I'd
let him have a taste.

42
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:49,083
A little slice of heaven
before he sees hell.

43

[SHALLTEAR]
Let me guess, Sebas.

45
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:43,583
Our unfortunate prey finally
took a bite of the bait?

46
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,666
[SEBAS]
Yes. Wonderfully.

47
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,375
[SHALLTEAR]
It's about time.

48
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:50,083
With any luck, we will find
a magic or martial arts user

49
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:53,250
that will suit Lord Ains, and
we will return to him soon.

50
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:55,041
If I may, my lady.

51
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:56,750
There is something
I've wanted to ask you

52
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:58,791
for some time now.

53
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:00,166
Go on.

54
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,000
[SEBAS] It's quite apparent
that you and Lady Aura

55
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:03,750
do not get along well.

56
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:06,541
I was wondering if there was
a special reason for that.

57
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:09,583
I always thought
we got along fine.

58
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:11,541
There is no bad blood
between the two of us.

59
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,583
I simply tease her
because my creator,

60
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:16,458
Lord Peroroncino,
decided that I should.

61
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:18,750
You see, that flat-chested
insect's creator,

62
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:21,708
Lady Bukubuku Chagama,
is actually the sister

63
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,000
of Lord Peroroncino.

64
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:26,375
I never knew about this!

65
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:28,458
I happened to overhear
my blessed creator

66
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:31,166
talking about it with
Lord Ains one evening.

the lead voice in the new

H-Game I just bought.

71
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,958
[MOMONGA] Well, Bukubuku
Chagama is a popular

72
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:45,166
voice actor these days. But I
totally feel your pain, man.

73
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,625
[PERORONCINO] I was itchin'
to hit it hardcore, too.

74
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:51,958
[MOMONGA] Better save those
tissues for another day.

75
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:54,208
What is a "voice-actor"?

76
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:57,416
Apparently, voice actors have
an incredibly important job.

77
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,458
They imbue souls into beings
that are otherwise soulless.

78
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:02,875
To put it plainly,
they bring things to life,

79
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:04,916
like any decent god should.

80
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,458
I see.

81
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:08,708
Thank you for sharing all of
that with us, Lady Shalltear.

You honor us both.

83
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:11,708
Learning more about
the Supreme Beings

84

[BRIDE 10A]
Lady Shalltear, we have found

116
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,500
the nest of these humans.

117
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:17,750
There is a man among
them, called Brain,

118
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:20,250
who is adept at
martial arts skills.

119
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,333
Apparently, he fought
on equal terms

120
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:26,041
with Gazef, the royal head
warrior of this kingdom.

your strength and speed.

You're just as weak as you
were before we started.

If you want to make
a good impression,

The fact that you know

you might be of minor use
to my beloved master.

We were hired to find a group

Since Shalltear is undead,
she has a passive skill

the fact that she has revolted.

319
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,208
I suggest we send
a hunting party

320
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:03,958
to deal with her, immediately.

321
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:04,958
[AINS]
Hm...

322
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:06,958
[ALBEDO]
I will lead our forces.

323
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:10,958
Cocytus and Mare will accompany
me as vice-commanders.

324
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:13,541
We will need that much
to take Shalltear down.

325
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:15,708
Her strength is formidable.

326
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:18,958
[AINS] No. I feel that
would be too hasty.

327
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:21,000
First, we must confirm
whether she has revolted

328
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:23,416
of her own free will or not.

329
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,125
[MOMONGA] If something like
this can happen to the NPCs,

330
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:29,166
I need to find out what it
is and how to counter it.

331
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:32,250
Or Nazarick will crumble.

332
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,791
[AINS sighs]
If she betrayed us

333
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:36,791
because she is
displeased with me,

334
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:39,500
or our treatment of her,
I would understand.

335
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:41,083
Displeased?

336
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:44,125
If she truly thinks that after
you've been so merciful to us,

337
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:45,875
I won't allow her to live!

338
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:48,791
[AINS]
Please, Albedo, calm yourself.

339
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,791
Remember, my old
comrades created

340
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:53,875
all of your personalities.

341
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:56,250
They made you with
all of their hearts.

342
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:59,708
That includes the bad qualities,
as well as the good.

343
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:02,250
You are made exactly
as they wanted you.

344
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:04,708
And I love all of you for that.

345
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:06,541
--So, if Shalltear has indeed
--[ALBEDO] Loves? He loves us.

346
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,208
--betrayed me, she is simply
--[ALBEDO] Loves? He loves us.

347
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:09,583
--following the path that
--So... He loves me!

348
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:12,125
--Peroroncino laid out for her.
--So... He loves me!

349
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:14,416
Loves me. Loves me.

350
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,750
He loves me!

351
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:18,958
[AINS] Uh-- Hey, Albedo.
Weren't you listening?

352
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:20,625
I said "all of you." 

353
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:21,791
Yes, I know.

354
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:23,833
But "all" includes me,
doesn't it?

355
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:25,250
Am I right, my lord, Ains?

356
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:29,041
[AINS]
I, w-well, yes, I suppose so.

357
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:30,666
--Lord Ains said he loves me!
--[AINS] Albedo, wait.

358
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,916
--Lord Ains said he loves me!
--That's not what I--

359
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,666
[ALBENDO] This is the
greatest day of my life!

360
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:37,333
[AINS] Anyway! Before
we do anything else,

361
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:39,666
we must find Shalltear.

362
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:19,708
[AINS]
An emergency announcement

363
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,375
has come from the
Adventurer's Guild.

364
00:24:22,458 --> 00:24:25,500
According to the Guild Master,
a vampire in the form

365
00:24:25,583 --> 00:24:29,000
of a young girl has appeared
not far from the capital.

366
00:24:29,083 --> 00:24:31,666
In order to minimize
Shalltear's exposure,

367
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:34,625
I volunteer to hunt
her down myself.

368
00:24:34,708 --> 00:24:39,041
Any embers that may fall upon
Nazarick must be destroyed.

369
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:42,416
Utterly... Completely...

370
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:46,083
Chapter 11: "Confusion
and Understanding."
