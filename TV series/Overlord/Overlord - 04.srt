00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:39,958
[HEAD PRIEST]
Nigun Grid Luwin.

2
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:42,541
As captain of the
Sunlit Scripture,

3
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:43,958
one of the six scriptures

4
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:47,375
of the Six Great Gods, you
are called upon to serve.

5
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:48,791
[NIGUN]
With honor.

6
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:52,125
[HEAD PRIEST] You will go
to the Re-Estize Kingdom.

7
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:55,125
Locate Gazef Stronoff,
and eliminate him.

8
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:56,500
[grunts]

9
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:01,083
[HEAD PRIEST] This treasure
contains a miracle of the Gods.

10
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:04,708
Use it only if necessary.

11
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:06,875
[NIGUN]
Attention, all units.

12
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:09,708
Our prey has entered the cage.

13
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:13,791
Devote yourself to the Gods,
and carry out their will.

14
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:50,000
[GAZEF]
There they are.

15
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:51,416
It looks like
they've surrounded us

16
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,000
in equal intervals.

17
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:56,250
[AINS] Do you have some
idea of who they are?

18
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:58,250
Only the Slane Theocracy
could send out

19
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,583
this many magic casters at once.

20
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:02,041
And they're part of
a special ops unit

21
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:04,208
directly under the Head Priest.

22
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:07,000
It must be one of
the six scriptures.

23
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:10,708
[AINS] Then the men who attacked
the village earlier...?

24
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:13,041
Theocracy soldiers, no doubt.

25
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:16,500
Looks like they dressed in
Imperial armor to throw us off.

26
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:17,875
[AINS]
As I thought.

27
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:21,333
Does this village hold
some significant value?

28
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:24,125
If you don't know
why they're attacking,

29
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,458
then I'm assuming
they're not after you,

30
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:28,666
which means one thing.

31
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,833
[AINS] It would appear that
you are quite despised,

32
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:32,583
Chief Warrior.

33
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,875
Indeed. Well, lucky me.

34
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:39,000
To think, even the Slane
Theocracy wants me dead.

35
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:43,125
[MOMONGA] But those creatures
look like Archangel Flames.

36
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:46,666
Why is a monster
from Yggdrasil here?

37
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:51,458
[GAZEF] Sir Ains.
I would like to hire you.

38
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:54,208
Name your price and I'll
make sure you get it.

39
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:56,958
[AINS]
Sorry, but I have to decline.

40
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:58,916
Very well.

41
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,875
Then, please take care
and thanks again.

42
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:05,291
This village owes
you gratitude. As do I.

43
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:07,708
[AINS grunts]

44
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:11,083
I am grateful, which is
why I hesitate to ask.

45
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:13,541
I know this is
a selfish request.

46
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:17,375
Please, grant these people
your protection one more time.

47
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:20,583
I have nothing to offer
you now, but, I beg you.

48
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,708
Please-- 

49
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:25,583
[AINS] There is no need for
you to go that far, Gazef.

50
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:30,375
I understand. I will be sure
to protect the villagers.

51
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:34,375
I will even put the name of
Ains Ooal Gown on the line.

52
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:36,750
Then, I will have
nothing to worry about.

53
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:40,458
Instead, I will focus
on the task before me.

54
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:43,500
[AINS]
Take this. I insist.

55
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:48,958
[gasps] You're giving me a gift?
I gratefully accept it.

56
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:52,666
Thanks.

57
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,250
[AINS]
Good luck.

58
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,333
Ha!

59
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:04,166
[AINS sighs] When I first
met the humans here,

60
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,375
I saw them as no more
than insects, as you do.

61
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:10,041
But, the more I speak with
them, the fonder I grow.

62
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,541
Like a child among
helpless animals.

63
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,375
[ALBEDO] Is that the reason
you were willing to promise

64
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:18,125
the honor of your great name
to his request, my lord?

65
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:20,000
[AINS]
Perhaps.

66
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:21,833
[VILLAGE CHIEF]
Lord Ains!

67
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:23,708
Those marauders are
still out there.

68
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:25,750
Why is the Chief
Warrior leaving?

69
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:28,875
[AINS] Because he was their
true target, not the village.

70
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,625
Then, should we just
stay here and wait

71
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:32,541
for him to deal
with those brigands?

72
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,125
[AINS]
That would be unwise.

73
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,958
Once the Chief Warrior and
his men disrupt their lines,

74
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:39,500
we will make our escape.

75
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,541
He will cause as much
commotion as he can

76
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,791
to make a clear path for us.

We'll attack them head on!

Break through the soldiers
and lead the enemy

away from the villagers!

81

After that, continue to retreat!

163
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,458
[AINS] Looks like it's
time for us to switch.

164
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:33,458
[VILLAGERS gasp, murmur]

165
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:37,000
Huh? Where am I?

166
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:39,708
[VILLAGE CHIEF] This is the
village storage house.

167
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:41,791
Lord Ains set up
a magical barrier

168
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,875
to keep us all safe.

169
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,333
Is he here?

170
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:47,416
He was, but he just vanished

171
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,791
right in front of our eyes.
Then you appeared in his place.

172
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,250
[gasps]

173
00:10:57,666 --> 00:11:00,458
I'll be...

174

[clatter]

175
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,125
And just who are you?

176
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:17,458
[AINS] Nice to meet you,
people of the Slane Theocracy.

177
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:21,125
My name is Ains Ooal Gown.

178
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:24,583
But, please, call me Ains.

179
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:33,333
[AINS] I have something
of a relationship

180
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:34,916
with those villagers.

181
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,791
Have you come to
beg for their lives,

182
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:37,958
or just your own?

183
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:42,250
[AINS]
No, no. You misunderstand.

184
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:43,333
[SLANE PRIESTS]
Hm?

185
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:44,958
[AINS]
I overheard your conversation

186
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:46,958
with the Chief Warrior.

187
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:49,625
You really have a lot
of balls, don't you?

188
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:50,791
Huh?

189
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:52,625
[AINS] I spent my
precious time and energy

190
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:55,291
saving those people,
and you brazenly declared

191
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,750
your intent to massacre them.

192
00:11:57,833 --> 00:12:01,291
I can't imagine
anything more offensive.

193
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:03,208
You're being rather
brazen yourself,

194
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:07,166
for a meager magic caster.
So, what do you plan to do?

195
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:10,166
[AINS] Offer your pitiful life
to me without resistance.

196
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,666
Do this and there
will be no pain.

197
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:18,000
However, if you refuse,
I swear, here and now,

198
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:23,291
you will die painfully and in
despair for your imprudence.

199
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,583
Have the angels
attack this fool!

200
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,916
[gasps] Is that all you had?

201
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,500
I expected more after
a bluff like that.

202
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:37,500
Huh?

203
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:39,041
[AINS]
Did you not hear me?

204
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:42,958
I said to offer your
life without resistance.

205
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,666
By the time I'm
through with you,

206
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,916
you'll wish you had listened.

207
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
[SLANE PRIEST 4C]
A trick!

208
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:49,750
[SLANE PRIEST 4D]
Yes! It has to be!

209
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:52,041
[AINS] High Tiered
Physical Nullification.

210
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:54,083
It's a passive skill
that completely nullifies

211
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:55,166
the physical attacks

212
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,333
of low-leveled
weapons and monsters.

[AINS]
As I thought.

216
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:07,666
They really are the Archangel
Flames from Yggdrasil.

217
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:11,458
[AINS] The fact that you can
use magic and summon spells

218
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,583
from Yggdrasil intrigues me.

219
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:15,291
I want to know why
they exist here,

220
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:17,541
and how you could
have learned them.

221
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:21,458
But, for now, I'll
focus on killing you.

222
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:22,958
It's my turn.

223
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:26,416
You wanted a massacre?
You'll get one.

224
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:31,000
Don't just stand there.
Attack him! Hurry!

225
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:32,791
[AINS]
Albedo, stand back.

[gasps] That's not... possible!

[GAZEF] When the man in
the village comes for you,

231
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:48,041
it will be a massacre.

[AINS]
Hm.

234
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:58,250
It would seem they know
more Yggdrasil spells

235
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,708
than I initially thought.

236
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:04,250
Tell me! Where did
you learn that magic?

[SLANE PRIEST 4A yelping]

238

What just happened?

[AINS]
Albedo.

240
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:16,166
You're well aware that these
pitiful, low-level spells

241
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,958
would have done me no harm.

242
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,708
There was no need
for you to interfere.

243
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:22,791
[ALBEDO]
I beg your pardon, Lord Ains.

244
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:25,250
but if someone wishes
to fight a Supreme Being,

245
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:28,708
such as you, they should
at least be able to best me.

246
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:31,500
These men are mere pebbles
fighting a mountain.

247
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:34,791
[AINS laughs] I'm afraid they
wouldn't meet your requirements

That was... one hit!

00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:10,125
That's impossible!

256
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:12,625
There's no way a high level
angel could be destroyed

257

using only one spell!

What should we do now?

00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:21,625
We'll summon the

Is that...?

263
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,791
[MOMONGA] Based on how it
glows, it's a sealing crystal

264
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:32,375
that can hold any magic
other than top tier spells.

265
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:35,916
So, they even have
Yggdrasil items.

That's right.

274
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:09,125
I didn't think I'd have to call
on it, but you proved worthy

275
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:11,541
of its divine greatness!

276
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:14,166
[AINS] I'm at a complete
loss for words.

Regretting your folly?

I wouldn't blame
you if you were.

This is stupid.

What?

281
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,041
[AINS] I can't believe
I put up my guard

282

for this sort of child's play.

283

What was that?
You can't be serious!

No way. You're, lying!

Smite him with

00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,291
I'm guessing the Theocracy.

322
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:21,416
But my defense barrier
counteracted it,

323
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,291
so I doubt they saw very much.

324
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:28,333
My country was watching me?

325
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:31,083
[AINS] If that's all you had,
it's time to end this.

326
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:33,291
[NIGUN]
No! No, no, no please, wait!

327
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:37,166
I beg of you, Sir Ains. I mean,
Lord Ains! Spare my life!

328
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,500
The rest of these
men don't matter!

329
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:39,875
[SLANE PRIESTS yell]

330
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:41,125
[NIGUN] I'll give you
anything you wish! Name it!

331
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:42,833
I will do whatever it
takes to appease you!

332
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:45,041
[ALBEDO]
I think you're confused.

333
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,291
Huh?

334
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,958
[ALBEDO] Lord Ains has
no need for sniveling

335
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:51,625
lower life forms. Humans like
you should bow their heads

336
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:55,541
and give thanks to him for
ending their miserable lives.

337
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:59,333
What's that mean,
"humans like me"?

338
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,875
[AINS]
What was it you said to Gazef?

339
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:03,833
"Cease your futile resistance

340
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:06,250
and just lie down
like a good dog."

341
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:07,708
As an act of mercy,

342
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:10,750
I'll make sure your
death is painless."

343
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:18,958
[MOMONGA]
I wonder...

344
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:21,041
Did I live up to
Albedo's expectations

345
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,750
as the Lord of Nazarick?

346
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:27,291
So cool! Lord Ains
is such a badass.

347
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,541
[AINS]
Hm? Did you say something?

348
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,416
[ALBEDO]
Hm? Nothing, my lord.

349
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,500
But, if I may ask, why did
you save that human soldier?

350
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:38,125
You even gave him
that important relic.

351
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:39,541
[MOMONGA]
Actually, it was a gimmick item

352
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,791
from a lottery machine.

353
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,750
More importantly, you
could have sent me

354
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:45,541
to fight in your place.

355
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:47,041
I am your shield.

356
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:50,291
There was no need to personally
risk your life like that.

357
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,208
[AINS]
I know your strength, Albedo,

358
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,291
and I trust your devotion.

359
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:56,666
However, until we know
more about this world,

360
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,041
we must proceed with
the utmost caution.

361
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:02,291
Believing the enemy is stronger
than us keeps us safe.

362
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:05,666
So you tested their power
by using him as a pawn!

363
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:09,958
Your use of humans is
truly impeccable, my lord.

364
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,250
Uh, however...

365
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,708
I fail to see how taking
that last angel's attack

366
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,708
head on counted as "caution."

367
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:17,333
[AINS]
Is that so?

368
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:20,000
Watching you feel pain
was more than I could bare.

369
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:22,916
I knew you would come through
it unscathed, but still.

370
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,333
No woman wants her
true love to get hurt!

371
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:28,416
[AINS]
Oh, right.

372
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,875
Let's go home, Albedo.

373
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:33,333
[ALBEDO]
With pleasure, Lord Ains!

374
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:36,583
[AINS]
Everyone.

375
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:40,125
I want to apologize for
leaving the Tomb on my own.

376
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:41,833
There will be time
to fill you in

377
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:43,666
on all that has happened.

378
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,500
However, there is a
more pressing matter

379
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,750
I want to attend to.

380
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:50,250
"Greater Break Item"!

381
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:51,208
[GUARDIANS gasp]

382
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,583
[AINS]
I have changed my name.

383
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:57,250
From this day forward,
I will be known as:

384
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:59,666
Ains Ooal Gown!

385
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,791
You shall call me Ains!

386
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:06,375
If you have any objections,
stand and voice them!

387
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:08,666
We have heard your
precious name, lord.

388
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:12,708
And devote ourselves to it
with unwavering loyalty.

389
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:15,375
Glory to Lord Ains Ooal Gown!

390
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:19,041
[GUARDIANS] Glory to Lord
Ains Ooal Gown! All hail!

391
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:20,791
We give ourselves to you,

392
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:23,083
utterly and without
any hesitation!

393
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:25,541
[BOTH] To the most
powerful Supreme Being!

394
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:26,958
Everyone in this world will know

395
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:30,541
of your greatness, and
fear your undying wrath.

396
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:33,791
[COCYTUS] Our king, who
rules over all, forever.

397
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:37,833
Glory to the Overlord,
the supreme ruler of death!

398
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:40,125
[AINS]
This is an absolute order!

399
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:44,291
Make the name Ains Ooal
Gown an eternal legend!

400
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:45,791
[GUARDIANS cheer]

401
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:48,208
[MOMONGA] Across the land,
through the sky,

402
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:49,875
and over the sea.

403
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:51,875
I will spread the name
of Ains Ooal Gown

404
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:55,708
to every corner of
this strange new world.

405
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:58,500
If any of my friends
have come here as well,

406
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:01,875
they'll know they're
not alone and find me.

407
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:37,500
[ALBEDO] Demiurge,
please tell everyone about

408
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:41,125
your conversation
with the master.

409
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:43,500
I was with Lord Ains
the first night we arrived

410
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:46,666
in this world and
he told me this:

411
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,666
"The stars glitter like jewels.

412
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:51,416
I was sent to this land to
obtain those jewels for myself,

413
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,791
along with every treasure
that shines beneath them."

414
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:58,041
Then, after a moment,
I heard him say:

415
00:23:58,125 --> 00:24:00,125
"The most enjoyable
thing now might be

416
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:02,875
taking over the world." Yes.

417
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:04,416
[ALBEDO]
Hear that?

418
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,500
Let it be known, here and now,
that this is our final goal.

419
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:09,958
As servants of the
Tomb of Nazarick,

420
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:11,875
we will present this
world to Lord Ains,

421
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:13,125
without fail!

422
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:16,583
[GUARDIANS cheer]

423
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:19,625
[AINS]
In order to collect information

424
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:23,541
about this new world, there's a
need to live among the humans.

425
00:24:23,625 --> 00:24:26,875
To this end, I've hidden my
skeleton body in a suit of armor

426
00:24:26,958 --> 00:24:29,541
and entered the Adventurer's
Guild under the name "Momon"

427
00:24:29,625 --> 00:24:32,125
with Narberal at
my side as "Nabe."

428
00:24:32,208 --> 00:24:34,208
If I make a name
for myself here,

429
00:24:34,291 --> 00:24:38,125
I'll be able to make some money
and gather vauable intel.

430
00:24:38,208 --> 00:24:40,416
It's a completely perfect plan.

431
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,666
But I couldn't have foreseen

432
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:45,041
that even Narberal hated
humans so pasionately.

433
