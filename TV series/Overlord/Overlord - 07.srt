[AINS]
That was foolish.

3
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:57,541
Hey... About what
I said last night.

4
00:00:57,625 --> 00:00:59,791
I'm really sorry.

5
00:01:02,583 --> 00:01:04,958
[AINS] Mentally and physically,
I've become an undead,

6
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:08,250
but I still let my
emotions control me.

7
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:12,416
Uh... This area's got quite
the scenery, doesn't it?

8
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,000
It's so peaceful. Why don't
we just relax and enjoy?

9
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:16,750
It's important to be on guard.

10
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:19,500
He's right. Carelessness
gets you killed.

11
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:21,750
A dragon could ambush
and roast the lot of us

12
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:23,666
before we'd have time to react.

13
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,958
Give me a break.

14
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:27,333
You can't seriously
believe that would happen.

15
00:01:27,416 --> 00:01:29,833
There are plenty of local
legends to support it.

16
00:01:29,916 --> 00:01:32,041
Apparently, there's a
dragon near E-Rantel

17
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:34,958
that's able to control
nature at will.

18
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:36,458
And north...

19
00:01:36,541 --> 00:01:38,333
I've heard that there are quite
a few living frost dragons

20
00:01:38,416 --> 00:01:40,000
that make their nests
on the other side

22
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:44,458
There could be
hundreds up there.

[AINS clears throat]
Um. Ninya.

24
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:49,125
You wouldn't happen to know
the name of the dragon

25
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:51,458
with the power over nature?

26
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:54,500
Huh? Sorry. No idea.

27
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:56,666
I'll ask when
we're back in town.

28
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:00,916

be of great help to me.

33
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:18,458
If they do exist in this world,
I should be cautious of them.

34

Everyone calm down.

We'd rather not have to cross
swords if we can avoid it.

Especially with the giant
in the plate armor.

when I feel one,

case of the willies.

Definitely.

57
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,375
[MOMONGA] I thought I
recognized these goblins.

58
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:59,291
She must have used one of
the horns I gave her.

59
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:00,916
But...

60
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,083
I have a friend who
frequents our village.

61

He's a pharmacist who
also practices magic.

62
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,250
[MOMONGA] To think she
was talking about him.

63
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:17,166
[NPHIREA]
Sorry. I don't know what to say.

Yeah.

I can protect her!

It's fine. I still
have my little sister.

Looking after her
has kept me going.

Oh-- Of course,
that's wonderful.

72

By the way...

help however I can!

How sweet. Thank you, Nphirea.

I'm so lucky to have an amazing
friend like you in my life.

00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:09,500
Huh? Right.

88
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:14,250
A good friend, that's what
I am, and nothing more. Yeah.

89
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:17,125
Anyway, what's the
deal with the goblins?

90
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:18,875
They appeared out of thin air.

91
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:21,375
Well, after I used the
magical item our savior,

92
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:23,166
Lord Gown, gave to me.

93
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,416
They call me their boss,
and help out around the village

94
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,250
when I ask them.

95
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:28,500
[NPHIREA]
I see.

96
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:31,416
So, what kind of person
is this "Gown" fellow?

97
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,625
Really?

98
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,291
I figured if anyone
would know about him,

99
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:37,416
it would be you,
Nphirea. He's amazing.

100
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,541
Amazing? In what way?

101
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:40,875
Oh.

102
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:42,833
Sorry, I was remembering
how he saved our village.

103
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:45,583
Uh-- I see. That makes sense.

104
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:48,041
I'm sure it was impressive.

105
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:50,166
It's a shot in the dark, but
if you give me some details,

106
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,958
I might be able to think
of who he could be.

107
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:55,083
His magic skills
were incredible.

108
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:57,500
He made lightning with
just a wave of his hands,

109
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,583
and crushed those marauders
like they were nothing.

110
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:01,000
Lightning?

111
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:04,208
In that case, he was probably
using third tier spells.

112
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,708
Is that good or bad?

113
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:07,458
Actually, it's great.

114
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,666
Reaching third tier magic
is the highest level

115
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,541
a normal person can achieve.

116
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:12,708
Oh, wow!

117
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:16,250
I knew he was awesome,
but I had no idea!

118
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:17,833
From what you've told me,

119
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:21,041
I wouldn't be surprised if he's
actually a hero class caster.

120
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:24,875
He might even have the ability
to cast fifth tier spells.

121
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:26,666
I still haven't
told you everything.

122
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:30,625
He gave me a blood red potion
that healed my wounds instantly!

123
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:32,291
[gasps]

124
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:36,583
[ENRI]
Also,

125
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:40,333
he had a female warrior with him
that was covered in black armor.

126
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:43,208
I think, I heard him
call her Albedo?

127
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:46,291
[NPHIREA]
That name... No way!

128
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:49,791
Then... Ains Ooal Gown is Momon?

129
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:50,750
[ENRI]
Huh?

130
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:51,625
[NPHIREA]
But that would mean

131
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:53,291
he's an adamantite level warrior

132
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:56,458
who can also cast high
level magic with ease.

133
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,583
If that's really
the case, then...

134
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,916
...it would make him
a hero among heroes!

135
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,125
He even saved Enri from
certain death and I've been

136
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:07,875
sneaking around trying
to steal his secrets.

137

What's the matter?
You look pale.

00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:26,416
[AINS] Hm? All right, I wouldn't
call any of them a natural.

143
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,708
But think about it.

144
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:29,708
Until ten days ago,
none of them had even

145
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:33,583
touched a bow before.
They've been through a lot.

146
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:35,625
They had to watch as
their friends, children,

147
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,166
and parents were murdered.

148
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,041
But instead of giving in to
misery, they're working hard

149
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,833
to make sure that atrocity
never happens again.

150
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:46,083
If nothing else, it's inspiring.

151
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:47,708
[NARBERAL]
I hadn't thought of that.

00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,083
[NARBERAL grunts]

160
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:07,583
You saved this village.

161
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:11,416
Thank you. It really
means a lot to me.

162
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,666
[AINS]
No. You're mistaken. I'm not--

163
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,833
It's okay.

164
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,375
I get that you're
hiding your identity.

165
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:19,333
And I have no intention
of ruining that.

166
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:21,833
I just wanted to thank you. See,

167
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:25,500
if you hadn't done what you did,
Enri might not be alive today.

168
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:31,291
If she wasn't here, I'd
have nothing to live for.

169
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:32,625
You saved us both.

170
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:35,958
[AINS sighs]
Is that all, Nphirea?

171
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:40,125
Yes, of course. Actually...

172
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:44,125
There's something I've
been hiding since we met.

173
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:47,750
[AINS] Nabe, can you leave
us alone for a moment?

174
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,625
Understood, lord.

175
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:56,875
[NPHIREA]
Here goes.

176
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:59,666
The red potion, the one
you gave to that adventurer

177
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,125
back in E-Rantel.

178
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:03,291
it's so rare that none
of our modern methods

179
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,500
could ever hope to duplicate it.

180
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,041
I thought...

181
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:09,500
If I could learn the secret,
I could produce it on my own.

182
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,041
That's the reason I specifically

183
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:15,375
asked for your help. It was
dishonest, and I'm sorry.

184
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:16,375
[AINS]
I see.

185
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:17,958
[gasps]

186
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:19,041
[MOMONGA]
I should've known giving her

187
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,958
that potion was a mistake.

188
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:24,250
Even a n00b wouldn't have
screwed up that badly.

189
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,000
I hope you forgive me.

190
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,750
[AINS] What exactly do I
need to forgive you for?

191
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:29,958
[NPHIREA]
Hm?

192
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:31,458
[AINS] You requested
my assistance because

193
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,375
you wanted to get
in contact with me.

194
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:35,791
I fail to see how
that is a problem.

195
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:37,375
[AINS]
That said.

196
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,291
I would like to know what you
planned to do with the potion

197
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:41,708
once you had learned
to craft it.

198
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,875
To be perfectly honest,

199
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:44,875
I hadn't really
thought that far ahead.

200
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:47,625
The knowledge was tantalizing
enough on its own.

201
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:49,791
[AINS] There's nothing wrong
with wanting to know.

202
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:52,125
As long as you aren't using
your knowledge for evil,

203
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:54,458
I have no issue.

204
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:56,375
Enri's right about you.

205
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:59,708
You're great. I can see
why she admires you.

206
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,333
[AINS]
Be honest with me.

207
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:04,708
Are you the only one who knows
that I'm Ains Ooal Gown?

208
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:07,125
Yes, I haven't told anyone.

209
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,708
[AINS] That's good. I'd
like it to stay that way.

210
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:13,041
Right now, I'm an adventurer
named Momon, nothing more.

211
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:15,833
I'd appreciate it if
you didn't forget that.

212
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:16,833
Yes, sir.

213
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:18,083
I thought that's
how you'd want it.

214
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:20,916
It's no problem. Thanks again.

215
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,458
On behalf of the entire village,
and especially the woman I love.

216
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:27,125
[pants]

217
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:33,458
Sorry, lord. This is
entirely my fault.

218
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:34,625
[AINS]
You're right.

219
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:37,500
Saying Albedo's name
has compromised us.

220
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:39,958
I'll atone with my life.

221
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:42,416
[AINS]
It's fine!

222
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,208
Everyone makes
mistakes, Narberal.

223
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:46,833
You just need to make
a concerted effort

224
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:50,291
not to make the
same mistake again.

225
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:52,750
You are forgiven.
Now learn from this.

226
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:55,166
And put down your sword.

227
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,375
[NPHIREA] We'll enter
the forest through here.

228
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:04,000
I'll be counting on you
if anything attacks.

229
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:05,750
As long as we have
Mr. Momon with us,

230
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:08,166
I don't think anything in
there will have the guts.

231
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,000
Oh, yeah. One thing.

232
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:12,125
If we happen upon the Wise King,

233
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:14,583
I'd like for you to scare him
off instead of killing him.

234
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:15,375
Huh?

235
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,666
[AINS]
Care to explain?

236
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,250
[NPHIREA]
This entire area is within

237
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:21,166
the Wise King's territory.

238
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,041
He's the reason monsters
have never attempted

239
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:25,708
to attack Carne Village before.

240
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:28,083
If you kill him,
it could mean disaster.

241
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,375
I'm pretty sure that's
impossible, even for him.

242
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:31,458
[AINS]
I'll certainly try.

243
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:32,666
Huh?!

244
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,458
You do realize this is
a legendary creature

245
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:35,833
we're talking about, right?

246
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:37,583
You must be confident
in your strength

247
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:39,583
to have that attitude.

248
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:42,750
[AINS] Actually I have a
suggestion, if you don't mind.

249
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:44,291
[NPHIREA]
Please, feel free.

250
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:47,458
[AINS] Nabe can use magic
similar to Alarm.

251
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:50,708
I'd like the two of us
to scout ahead for a bit.

252
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,541
I'm fine with that.

253
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:55,458
But, try to get back to the
group as quick as you can.

254
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,250
[AINS]
Of course.

255
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:11,458
[AINS] That's far enough.
Now, why don't we talk about

256
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:14,000
how to spread my great name?

257
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:15,875
[AURA]
Sounds good!

258
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:18,250
Careful, Narberal.
That looks dangerous.

259
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:21,416
Oh, Lady Aura! I'm
sorry, you startled me.

260
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,000
My bad.

261
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:25,208
How long were you here?

262
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:26,291
[AURA]
Since you and Lord Ains

263
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:28,666
entered the forest
by yourselves.

264
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,916
I didn't sense your
presence at all.

265
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,375
[AURA] So, let me guess:
I need to find this Wise King

266
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:35,375
of the Forest and
send him your way.

267
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,541
A creature like that
could be of use, right?

268
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,291
[AINS]
Correct. Up to it?

269
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:40,958
Consider it done!

270
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:43,333
I think I might know where
it's making its nest.

271
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:45,916
[AINS] Excellent. I'm
counting on you, Aura.

272
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,333
See ya!

273
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:51,208
What are you planning
to do, my lord?

274
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:53,291
[AINS] I will fight the
Wise King, of course.

275
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:54,583
Wasn't the battle with the ogres

276
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:56,416
a sufficient show
of your strength?

277
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,750
[AINS]
Hardly.

278
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,583
Killing an ogre with one
swing is nothing compared

279
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:02,208
to besting a legendary
magical creature.

280
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:04,250
If I want rumors of
the adventurer, Momon

281
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,000
to spread quickly in E-Rantel,

282
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:09,250
I need to accomplish something
the people can't ignore.

283
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:10,375
[NARBERAL]
I see.

286
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:18,541
What's wrong? Were you
two worried about me?

287
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,375
That tickles! Cut it out!

288
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:22,541
I have an important
mission from Lord Ains.

289
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,416
I can't play now! Whoa!

290
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,041
You wanna help, huh?

291
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:28,125
All right, I guess
I'll let you tag along.

292
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:30,541
[roars]

[FOREST KING snores]

294
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:51,166
[AURA] I really wanted to take
a shot at this thing myself,

295
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:54,333
but hey, orders are orders.

We're done here!

I don't like this.

Guys. Something big is
heading straight for us.

302
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:19,291
[NPHIREA] Is it the
Wise King of the Forest?

[AINS]
Don't worry. Leave it to us.

304

Sure. Thanks.

305
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:25,750
We're counting on you.

306
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,125
[NPHIREA]
Mr. Momon.

307
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:28,541
[AINS]
What is it?

308
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:30,916
Try not to push
yourself too hard, 'kay?

309
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,750
[AINS]
Right. Now, go! Quickly!

310
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:38,208
[AINS]
Why did I say that?

311
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:40,458
Without them here to witness
the fight, no one will know

312
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:43,375
I actually took on the
Wise King of the Forest.

313
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,958
[AINS] Maybe I should cut off
one of its legs as proof.

314
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,875
[AINS]
Let's greet our guest properly.

315
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:09,708
[AINS grunts]

316
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:17,666
[AINS grunts]

317
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,958
[FOREST KING]
Few can survive my first attack.

318
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:22,291
Admirable, it is.

319
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:23,833
[AINS]
The hell?

320
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,333
[FOREST KING]
Abide interlopers, I do not.

321
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:29,666
Many are the foolish who
have perished by my claws.

322
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,166
If you wish not to join
them, leave this place

323
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,708
and respectfully
withdraw, I shall.

324
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:35,666
What say you?

325
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:36,833
[AINS]
Forget it.

326
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:39,166
Why don't you stop
hiding and face me?

327
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,333
Are you shy?

328
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,958
Or are you afraid that
you won't survive?

329
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:45,750
[FOREST KING]
Insolent whelp! Very well.

330
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:49,791
Feast your eyes upon my form,
and tremble with awe!

331
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,250
[AINS]
I don't believe it.

332
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:08,083
[FOREST KING cackles] Your fear
and dismay are palpable, knave.

333
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,875
Have any last words, do you?

334
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:13,291
[AINS]
Actually, I have a question.

335
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:16,000
I believe I've met
your kind before.

336
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:19,541
Are you a Djungarian Hamster?

337
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:20,916
I am!

338
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,791
Tell me stranger, how is it
that you came to know

339
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,333
of my species?

340
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:28,458
[AINS] Well. Uh. Hm.
How should I put this?

341
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:30,250
One of my old allies
used to have a pet

342
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,708
that looked just like you.

343
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:33,875
'Tis true?

344
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:35,416
Then, please, tell me
where I might find

345
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,541
this person and my people.

346
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,041
My duty as a living creature

347
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:41,708
to make offspring and
continue my species, it is.

348
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:44,416
[AINS] I'm afraid your
size might hinder that.

349
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,958
[sighs] Truly
unfortunate, that is.

350
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,583
Understand, I do.

351
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:49,833
[AINS]
Sorry.

352
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:52,375
[groans] Okay, it is.

353
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:56,625
As for you, cease your
banter and come at me now.

354
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,416
Fight for our lives
as warriors, we shall!

355
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,458
[AINS groans]
"Wise King" my boney ass.

356
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:06,000
"Fluffy King's" more like it.
This is embarrassing.

357
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,625
[FOREST KING]
Trespassing in my territory

358
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:09,958
is a death sentence, it is.

359
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:12,875
Make a good meal,
the two of you shall.

360
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,375
[AINS]
What a letdown.

361
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:17,291
This was a complete
waste of time.

362
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:19,541
What are you
standing there for?

363
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:21,458
Surrendering, are you?

364
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:24,250
Disappointing, that would
be, as I expected more

365
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:25,708
of someone with your strength.

366
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:27,083
Come!

367
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:29,750
Fight to the death with me,
the way nature intended.

368
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,375
Survival of the fittest, it is!

369
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:34,875
[AINS]
No. I'm not doing this.

370
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:38,958
"Skill, Aura of Despair"!

371
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:41,916

[yelps]

373
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:55,583
Bested me, you have.
Surrender, I do! Have mercy!

374
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:58,208
[AINS groans]
He's just a helpless animal.

375
00:18:58,291 --> 00:18:59,333
[AURA]
Are you gonna kill him?

376
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:00,375
[AINS]
Hm?

377
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:02,041
If you are, I'd like
to use his skin

378
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,458
to make some leather.

379
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:05,500
His fur might make
a good rug, too.

380
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:08,583
Don't. Please, no!

381
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,458
No way...

382
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:12,583
[ALL]
The Wise King of the Forest?

383
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:13,958
[AINS]
Be at ease, friends.

384
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:17,166
You are perfectly safe.
He is under my command now.

385
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:20,083
He will not attack.
You have my word on that.

386
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:22,458
My master speaks
the truth, he does!

387
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,250
As long as he wishes it,

388
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:26,666
I shall not cause trouble
for you, or any human.

389
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,750
Devoted to his will, I am.

390
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:31,375
Whatever path he chooses,
follow, I shall.

391
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:34,333
Amazing! What an
awe-inspiring creature!

392
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:35,375
[MOMONGA]
Huh?

393
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,125
I can feel great
strength and wisdom

394
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:38,291
radiating from him.

395
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:40,625
[MOMONGA]
Great strength? Wisdom?

396
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,875
I guess your amazing
feats know no bounds.

397
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:46,041
It's no wonder someone like
Nabe stays by your side.

398
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:49,041
No kidding. You're
incredible, Mr. Momon.

399
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:52,291
We would have been massacred
if we took him on.

400
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:54,166
[AINS]
What do you make of this?

401
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,458
Putting his strength
aside, his eyes

402
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:59,458
do have a gleam of
power behind them.

403
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:01,000
[AINS]
No way!

404
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,541
[NPHIREA]
Mr. Momon?

405
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:04,958
I realize that this is
none of my business.

406
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:07,166
But, are you taking him
away from this place?

407
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,416
If you do that,

408
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,083
I'm afraid monsters will
attack Carne Village.

409
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:12,291
[AINS]
Well?

410
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:15,166
There is a chance of
that happening, master.

411
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,666
No way. Fine.

412
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,875
In that case,
Mr. Momon, I humbly ask

413
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,375
to become part of your team.

414
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:23,750
[AINS]
Huh?

415
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:26,333
I want to be able to protect
Enri and Carne Village.

416
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:28,666
If I had even a sliver
of your awesome strength.

417
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,041
I know for sure that I
could do that with ease!

418
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,000
My knowledge of pharmacy
will be completely

419
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:35,916
at your disposal. I'll
even carry your things!

420
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,666
Please! Make me your squire!

[ADVENTURERS gasp]

422

[AINS] In other words, you want
me to accept you as part

423
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:44,000
of my team and teach you
how to become stronger

424
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,375
as a magic caster?

425

Yes!

Forgive me.

I'm not laughing at
your determination.

I understand how you feel,
and I'll remember it.

430

However, I'm afraid I have no
use for a squire at this time.

Oh. I understand.

[AINS]
But, please, do not fret.

I have every intention
of lending my strength

to this village
whenever they need it.

Hey, Momon.

We're going to escort

to his shop and help him

I'll catch up with you.

I've never had a haul
this plentiful before.

I'll be sure to add
extra to your payment.

Your haul was possible because

of my master's strength.
Don't forget that.

My pride is ruined.

not a monster-slaying hero.

This is so embarrassing. Dammit.

I return to E-Rantel.

472
00:24:23,041 --> 00:24:26,083
The people shower me
with awe and praise.

473
00:24:26,166 --> 00:24:28,375
The Swords of Darkness
will undoubtedly spread

474
00:24:28,458 --> 00:24:31,750
the tale of our heroics to
other members of the guild.

475
00:24:31,833 --> 00:24:34,625
It won't be long until the
names "Momon" and "Nabe"

476
00:24:34,708 --> 00:24:36,583
spread across the land.

477
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:40,083
However, I soon discover that
the shadows of this new world

478
00:24:40,166 --> 00:24:42,958
hide far more sinister forces.

479
00:24:43,041 --> 00:24:46,833
Chapter eight: "Twin Swords
of Slashing Death."
