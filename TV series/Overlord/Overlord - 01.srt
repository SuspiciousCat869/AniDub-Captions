[MOMONGA] Dive Massively
Multiplayer Online

2
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,083
Role Playing Game.

3
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:45,875
Or, for short, "DMMO-RPG."

4
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:47,416
It's a type of game
where you can

5
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,291
immerse yourself in an imaginary
world as if you were in it.

6
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:52,875
Such as Yggdrasil.

7
00:00:52,958 --> 00:00:56,041
Released in the year 2126,
the game sported

8
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:58,791
an expansive world map
and an unusually high degree

9
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:01,541
of player freedom. These
features, among others,

10
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:05,750
made it stand above all other
DMMO-RPGs of its time.

11
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:10,041
And it became wildly popular
in the country of Japan.

12
00:01:10,125 --> 00:01:12,666
Now, after 12 years
of operation,

13
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,875
the world of Yggdrasil
is about to see its end.

[MOMONGA] It was fun.
In fact, it was a blast.

00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:00,333
[HEROHERO]
Hey, there.

30
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:02,291
It's been a while
hasn't it, Momonga?

31
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:03,625
[MOMONGA]
Sure has.

32
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:06,250
To be honest, Herohero,
I didn't think you'd come.

33
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,791
You've been gone
a couple of years.

34
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:12,375
[HEROHERO] No way. It's
really been that long? Man.

35
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:13,541
I guess I've been
working so much,

36
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:15,916
my concept of time
is out of whack.

37
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,250
[MOMONGA] That sucks.
It can't be healthy for you.

38
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:19,416
[HEROHERO]
Tell me about it.

39
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,458
I feel like my avatar looks.

40
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:23,083
[MOMONGA]
Hm.

41
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:24,875
[HEROHERO]
I'm sorry.

42
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:26,958
I shouldn't have come
here just to complain.

43
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:29,250
[MOMONGA]
Please, don't worry about it.

44
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,750
[HEROHERO]
Well, I better go soon.

45
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:34,041
I'm beyond exhausted.

46
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:37,833
[MOMONGA]
Right. Rest up and feel better.

47
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:39,500
[HEROHERO]
Wish I could stay longer.

48
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:42,333
But, gotta say, I'm
kinda shocked to see

49
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:44,666
the Great Tomb of
Nazarick still standing.

50
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,833
[MOMONGA]
Huh?

51
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:47,125
[HEROHERO]
Being guild leader suited you.

52
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,958
You've done a great job
maintaining the place.

53
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:52,208
[MOMONGA] Well, we created
this place together.

54
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:54,666
I couldn't just
let it go to dust.

55
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,041
[HEROHERO]
Must have been hard work.

56
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:57,625
Thanks for everything.

57
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,916
I hope we meet again IRL.

58
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:07,708
[MOMONGA] Today is the
last day Yggdrasil's servers

59
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:09,291
will be online.

60
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,541
Why not stay?

61
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,625
We could reminisce and
wait until everything

62
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:15,958
shuts down for good. [sighs]

63
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:18,583
[MOMONGA]
Oh well.

64
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:21,500
I'm happy that he
even came at all.

65
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:25,000
"I hope we meet
again," huh? Right.

66
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,416
Just when and where
would that be?

67
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:33,208
[MOMONGA]
This sucks!

68
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,708
[MOMONGA]
This is our home.

69
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:39,291
We built it together,
with virtual blood and sweat.

70
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:44,125
[MOMONGA] How can he turn
his back on it so easily?

71
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:50,083
[MOMONGA]
Stop it. He didn't.

72
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:53,625
No one in the
guild betrayed you.

73
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:57,166
Our guild's weapon:
the Staff of Ains Ooal Gown.

74
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:00,208
[MOMONGA]
We played recklessly to make it.

75
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,333
Some of us even spent our
PTO just to have time

76
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:04,250
to grind the materials.

77
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,166
[MOMONGA] But, among
the original 41 members,

78
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,208
37 of them quit.

79
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:15,291
[MOMONGA] Then, the three
that were left...

80
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:20,416
[MOMONGA] Let's go. You're
a testament of our guild.

81
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:23,208
[MOMONGA] There were two
requirements for joining

82
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:26,041
the guild, Ains Ooal Gown.

83
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:28,458
The player's avatar
had to be inhuman

84
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:30,333
and the player themself
had to be a functioning

85
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:32,083
member of society.

86
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:37,208
[MOMONGA] We put our livelihoods
on the line to play.

87
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:40,250
Some members managed to
make their dreams come true.

88
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:43,750
In the end, I can't blame
them for choosing real life.

89
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,000
[MOMONGA]
Uh--

90
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,958
[MOMONGA] Oh, yeah. I
forgot his name was Sebas.

91
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:57,083
And these are the combat
maids of the Pleiades.

92
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,625
We intended for them
to be the last

93
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:01,375
line of defense to the
throne room, but, in the end,

94
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:03,875
no player was able
to make it that far.

95
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:07,916
[MOMONGA]
I should move them around.

96
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,583
One last time. It's
the least I can do.

97
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,000
"Follow Me."

98
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,291
[MOMONGA]
I'm sure the other guild members

99
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:22,625
will forgive me for doing
whatever I want, just for today.

100
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,875
[MOMONGA]
Albedo.

101
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:49,750
[MOMONGA]
Hm?

102
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:53,208
The command was
"Stand By," right?

103
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,291
[MOMONGA sighs]

104
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:01,666
[MOMONGA]
Hm?

105
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:07,208
[MOMONGA]
What were her settings again?

106
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:10,083
"As the highest ranking NPC
in the Tomb of Nazarick,

107
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:13,583
she supervises all
of the Guardians."

108
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:15,458
Jeez, this is long!

109
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:16,958
Well...

110
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:19,875
Tabula, the settings maniac,
was the one who created her.

111
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:24,333
Huh? No way. She's a bitch?

112
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:25,833
[MOMONGA sighs]

113
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:28,375
[MOMONGA] He did love to make
contradicting characters.

114
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:32,333
I can't fault a guy for
his tastes, but still.

115
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:34,458
Normally, you need a
tool to change settings,

116
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:36,916
but since I have this...

117
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:45,375
[MOMONGA] Hm... Maybe I
should add something...

118
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:49,708
"She is deeply in
love with Momonga."

119
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:52,958
How embarrassing!
I'm such a dork!

120
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:00,375
[MOMONGA]
What was that command again?

121
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:02,166
"Bow down."

122
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,333
[MOMONGA sighs]

123
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:12,916
[MOMONGA] Now these are
relics of the past.

124
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:18,375
[MOMONGA]
There's mine. "Touch Me."

125
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:22,416
"Shijuuten Suzaku."
"Ankoro Mocchi Mocchi."

126
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,916
"Herohero." "Peroroncino."

127
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,333
"Bukubuku Chagama."
"Tabula Smaragdina."

128
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:30,583
"Warrior Takemikazuchi."

129
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:33,958
"Variable Talisman." "Genjiro."

130
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:38,791
[MOMONGA sighs]
Well, it was fun.

131
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:43,625
[MOMONGA]
In fact, it was a blast.

132
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:48,333
[MOMONGA sighs]
I have to wake up at four AM.

133
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:50,875
I better crash after
the server shuts down.

134
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:53,083
I don't wanna be
a zombie at work.

135
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,041
[MOMONGA gasps]

136
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:11,666
[MOMONGA] Did the devs push
back the server shutdown?

137
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:15,833
[MOMONGA]
Where's my console?

138
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:18,708
I can't use chat or call a GM!

139
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,208
What's going on?!

140
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:26,708
[ALBEDO] Is something
the matter, Lord Momonga?

141
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:28,083
[MOMONGA]
Hm?

142
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:32,625
[MOMONGA]
U-Uh...

143
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:37,541
Lord Momonga?

144
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:42,125
[ALBEDO] Lord Momonga?
Is everything all right?

145
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,583
You seem troubled, my lord.

146
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:45,250
[MOMONGA]
Uh...

147
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,250
[ALBEDO gasps]

148
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:50,000
If there's a problem,
please let me help.

149
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:53,791
[MOMONGA gasps]

150
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:01,375
[AINS] The GM call
function isn't working.

151
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:06,500
I'm sorry, but I have no answer.

152
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,375
This "GM Call"
magic you speak of

153
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:09,958
is beyond my comprehension.

154
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:11,916
[MOMONGA]
Her mouth is moving!

155
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,750
[ALBEDO] I realize my failure
to assist you is inexcusable.

156
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:18,333
I don't deserve it, but I
beg for your mercy, lord.

157
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:21,208
[MOMONGA] I'm actually
talking with an NPC?!

158
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:26,708
[MOMONGA] No way. Is this
a bug? A programming error?

159
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,125
[MOMONGA]
Okay, the staff still functions

160
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:35,458
like it normally does,
but I can't use my console,

161
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:37,958
or contact the administrators.

162
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,958
What should I do?

163
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:41,083
[AINS]
Sebas!

164
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,625
[SEBAS]
Lord.

165
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:45,833
[MOMONGA] Is it okay for
me to give him orders?

166
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:47,500
Ah, screw it.

167
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:49,666
[AINS]
Sebas.

168
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,333
Step out of the
Great Tomb and confirm

169
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:54,041
the surroundings of Nazarick.

170
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:57,166
By your command,
my lord. I'll return.

171
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,666
Pleiades, I want you
on the ninth floor.

172
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,500
If anyone tries to
trespass, deal with them.

173
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:06,625
As you wish, my lord.
It will be done.

174
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:08,750
[MOMONGA] They even recognize
and respond to commands

175
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:12,000
that aren't native to the game.

176
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:14,875
What in the world is going on?

177
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:16,125
Mm?

178
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:18,541
[MOMONGA]
Uh--

179
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:21,375
Think. How can I
contact an administrator?

180
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:23,833
The "GM Call"
function is busted.

181
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:25,958
The "Message" spell? Maybe.

182
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:28,208
It's normally used for players
to contact each other,

183
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:30,458
so there's a chance.

184
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:33,333
But I'm not sure I
can even use magic.

185
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:35,083
[ALBEDO]
So, Lord Momonga?

186
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:36,166
[MOMONGA]
Huh?

187
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,541
Do you have any orders
for me to obey?

188
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:39,875
[AINS]
Let's see.

189
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:42,500
I guess, you could come
here for a moment.

190
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:44,750
Sure!

191
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:47,416
[MOMONGA]
Whoa! She smells great!

192
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,916
Wait, "smell"?

193
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,416
There was never a function
like that in Yggdrasil.

194
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,500
[AINS]
Albedo, may I touch you?

195
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:56,416
Yes!

196
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,583
[gasps]

197
00:12:57,666 --> 00:13:00,500
[MOMONGA]
No way. She has a pulse.

198
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:01,833
This is crazy!

199
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:05,500
She's supposed to be an
NPC run by an AI program.

200
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:08,375
Why does she seem so alive?

201
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,750
Okay. Focus. Last test.

202
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,750
I have to confirm this,
no matter the cost!

203
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:17,666
[AINS] Albedo. May--
May I touch your chest?

204
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,916
[ALBEDO]
Eh?

205
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,958
[MOMONGA] Uh! This is
necessary! Play it cool!

206
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:24,416
Act natural, like
it's no big deal.

207
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,041
Uh, you don't mind that, right?

208
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,708
[MOMONGA]
You blew it, n00b!

209
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:32,208
Of course not! Touch me
as much as you wish!

210
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,833
[MOMONGA]
Uh...

211
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:42,666
[moans]

212
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,125
[MOMONGA]
Let's think this through.

213
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:46,000
The fact I can do something
reserved for a hentai game

214
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:48,625
means this isn't a new
version of Yggdrasil,

215
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:53,875
and chances are slim that
this is some new DMMO-RPG.

216
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,083
Is it possible that this
virtual world somehow

217
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:58,916
became real all of a sudden?

218
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,416
No way. That's nuts.

219
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,458
But, really, talking
to the NPCS,

220
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:05,375
smelling their scent,
touching them...

221
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,041
All of these things
have been impossible

222
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:09,000
to program into games.

223
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,208
[MOMONGA]
Hey!

224
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,375
How long did I plan
on fondling her?

225
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:17,041
[AINS] A-Albedo. I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to--

226
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:18,416
This is it, isn't it?

227
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,125
You're going to
take me right here?

228
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:21,375
[AINS]
Uh--

229
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:22,875
[ALBEDO] Oh! What shall
I do about my clothes?

230
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,250
Should I remove them on my own?

231
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:26,625
Or would you prefer to
get rid of them yourself?

232
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:28,625
[AINS]
Whoa! Hold on a moment, Albedo!

233
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:30,625
This isn't right!

234
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:31,958
[AINS clears throat]

235
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:34,500
[AINS] Now is not the time
to be doing such things.

236
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:37,333
[ALBEDO gasps]
I'm so sorry, Lord Momonga!

237
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:41,708
[AINS] It's fine, Albedo.
I forgive you completely.

238
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:44,833
More importantly, I have
an order for you.

239
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:47,541
It would be my
pleasure to serve you.

240
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:49,291
[AINS] Except for the
Guardians of the fourth

241
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,125
and eighth floors,
I want everyone to meet

242
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:54,000
at the sixth floor's
fighting arena.

243
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:56,875
Have them gather
there in one hour.

244
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,916
As you wish, my lord.

245
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,666
[MOMONGA]
This is terrible.

246
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:05,833
Tabula...

247
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:07,500
I can't believe I
took the NPC you made

248
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,375
and tainted it like that.

249
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:19,375
[MOMONGA] Dammit. I'll
worry about that later.

250
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:22,458
I have plenty of other problems
to take care of first.

251
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:27,416
[MOMONGA]
It worked!

252
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:29,958
[MOMONGA]
The ring's teleportation ability

253
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:32,000
has no issues.

254
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:34,333
I can still use items.

255
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:38,000
[MOMONGA] It looks like Albedo
and the others are still loyal,

256
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:40,250
just like they were
programmed to be.

257
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:45,708
[MOMONGA] So then, what about
the other characters?

258
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:53,291
[MOMONGA]
The twin dark elves that Chagama

259
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,916
created should be the
Guardians of this floor.

260
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,750
Where are they?

261
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,541
[AURA yells]

262
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,041
[laughs]

263
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:03,875
Crushed it!

264
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:05,083
[AINS]
Aura.

265
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:08,583
We're honored to have
you, Lord Momonga!

266
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:10,958
Welcome to the sixth
floor amphitheater.

267
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:13,708
[AINS] I will only intrude
for a little while.

268
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:15,500
You must be joking, right?

269
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:18,166
You are the ruler of the
Great Tomb of Nazarick.

270
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,041
Your power here is absolute.

271
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:21,625
There isn't a
guardian that would

272
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:26,000
ever consider you an intruder,
least of all my brother and I.

273
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:28,333
[AINS]
Speaking of...

274
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:31,458
Mare! You're being rude
to Lord Momonga!

275
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:34,250
Stop cowering and get
down here already!

276
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:37,416
[MARE]
But, Sis, I'm scared! Come on.

277
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,333
Mare!

278
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:42,750
[MARE]
Okay, okay, fine! I'm coming!

279
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,666
[MARE grunts]

280
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,458
[MARE yelps]

281
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:48,541
[AURA]
Good grief.

282
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:51,500
[MARE pants]

283
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:52,958
We're gettin' old, here.

284
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:54,791
[MARE]
I'm hurrying!

285
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,250
Ah!

286
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:59,791
[MARE] I apologize for making
you wait, Lord Momonga.

287
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:01,333
[AINS]
It's fine.

288
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:04,500
Now, I'd like for the two of
you to help me with something.

289
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:05,125
[BOTH gasp]

290
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:06,375
Amazing!

291
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,208
Is that the legendary
item that will only bend

292
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:11,375
to your whim, Lord Momonga?
The fabled weapon of the Tomb?

293
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:12,583
[AINS]
Indeed.

294
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,250
It was created through
the combined efforts

295
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,791
of the guild's past members.

296
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:20,625
A testament of our dedication.
The Staff of Ains Ooal Gown.

297
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:22,375
Each stone in the
mouths of the seven

298
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,916
crowning snakes is
a god level artifact.

299
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,083
On top of that, the power
in the staff itself

300
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:29,291
transcends god level.

301
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:31,291
It is truly legendary.

302
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:34,291
Its base stats are on par
with any world level item.

303
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:36,625
In fact, the DPS of
its auto-attack alone

304
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:37,708
could one-shot--

305
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,958
[clears throat]

306
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:41,541
[AINS]
Well, anyways. That's how it is.

307
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:42,416
Incredible!

308
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,625
Awesome! It's so cool!

309
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:46,041
[AINS] I would like the
two of you to help me

310
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:47,666
run some tests with it.

311
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,916
Right! We won't
let you down, lord.

312
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,625
[AINS]
Also, Aura.

313
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:54,375
I've called for the other
Guardians to meet here.

314
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:56,708
They should arrive
within the hour.

315
00:17:56,791 --> 00:18:00,416
Huh? Does that mean
Shalltear's coming?

316
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,750
[AINS]
Yes.

317
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,416
[MOMONGA] In Yggdrasil, if
you wanted to conjure magic

318
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,083
you just had to click
the appropriate icon

319
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:09,750
on your console.

320
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:12,833
But now, that icon
doesn't exist.

321
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:16,500
However, if I focus hard
enough, I don't need it.

322
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:18,416
I feel the attack
range of my spells,

323
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:23,250
their individual cooldown rates.
Even how much MP I have!

324
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:25,000
I can do this.

325
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:29,500
[AINS]
Summon! Primal Fire Elemental!

326
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:37,250
Oh, wow!

327
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:43,625
[PRIMAL FIRE ELEMENTAL roars]

328
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,833
[AINS]
The Primal Fire Elemental.

329
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,625
Its level is in the upper 80s.

330
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:50,083
[BOTH gasping, giggling]

331
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:52,958
[AINS]
So, would you like to fight it?

332
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:54,666
Yeah! I'd love to!

333
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,541
I just remembered,
I have a few errands

334
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,416
I still need to tend to. Bye!

335
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,666
--[AURA] C'mon!
--[MARE whimpers]

336
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:11,041
[AINS] Primal Fire Elemental.
Attack the dark elf twins!

337
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:17,250
[AURA yells]

338
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:20,375
[gasps]

339
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:21,375
[whimpers]

340
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:23,250
Magic Shield!

341
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,000
[AURA yells]

342
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,833
[MOMONGA] I had a feeling
this would be easy for them.

343
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:36,958
Now I know my other magic
skills work, as well. But...

344
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:37,833
[AINS]
"Message."

345
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:40,375
[beeping]

346
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:41,583
[MOMONGA]
No go.

347
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:44,250
I can't connect to a GM
or my guild members.

348
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:50,208
[SEBAS]
I'm here.

349
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:52,166
Is there something
you need, Lord Momonga?

350
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:55,458
[MOMONGA] Wha--? My
"Message" spell connected?

351
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:58,625
[AINS] Sebas? How do things
look on the outside?

352
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:02,083
[SEBAS] Well, lord,
there is a slight problem.

353
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:05,166
[AINS] Hm. I have called all
the Guardians to gather.

354
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:08,000
Come to the amphitheater on
the sixth floor immediately.

355
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:10,875
You can report what you
saw once you're here.

356
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,500
[SEBAS]
Understood.

357
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:20,250
[AINS]
Well done. That was impressive.

358
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:21,458
That was fun!

359
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:24,625
I haven't exercised
that much in a while!

360
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:26,875
[AINS]
You two must be thirsty.

361
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:40,000
[AURA]
I have to admit, Lord Momonga,

362
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:41,708
I thought you'd be scarier.

363
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:43,375
[AINS]
Oh, is that so?

364
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:45,833
I can do that if
you'd like me to.

365
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:49,500
I like you this way.
It's the best!

366
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:50,833
[AINS]
Hmph.

367
00:20:54,791 --> 00:21:00,083
[SHALLTEAR] My, my. It appears
I'm the first to arrive.

368
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:01,416
[MOMONGA]
Well.

369
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,500
I don't have the foggiest
idea what's going on.

370
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:06,875
But it seems as if the
NPCs are all loyal to me.

371
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:10,000
Hm. In that case,
I should probably

372
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:12,250
keep playing my role and
act like a proper superior

373
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:13,875
in front of them.

374
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:15,583
While I'm at it, I'll
learn everything I can

375
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:18,583
about this world. I was
max level in Yggdrasil.

376
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:21,291
I wonder how strong
I'll be here?

377
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:22,875
And, if this is another world,

378
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:25,375
should I even try to
return to my old one?

379
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:28,333
It's not like I had anything
special back there.

380
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:30,166
I had no friends or family.

381
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,875
All I ever did was
work, eat, and sleep.

382
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:36,625
In all honesty, my life
wasn't worth much.

383
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:42,791
My lord. We, the Guardians,

384
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:45,833
pledge our fidelity.

385
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:47,708
I am the guardian
of the first, second,

386
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:53,333
and third floors, Shalltear
Bloodfallen. I serve and obey.

387
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:55,166
[COCYTUS]
The guardian of the fifth floor.

388
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:59,083
Cocytus. I serve and obey.

389
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:02,250
I am the guardian
of the sixth floor,

390
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:03,833
Aura Bella Fiora.

391
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:05,708
I am her brother,
and also the guardian

392
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:08,958
of the sixth floor,
Mare Bello Fiore.

393
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:11,291
[BOTH]
We serve and obey.

394
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:13,291
The guardian of
the seventh floor.

395
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:16,916
Demiurge. I serve and obey.

396
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,208
The leader of the Guardians.
Albedo. I serve and obey.

397
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:26,416
Other than Victim,
guardian of the eighth floor,

398
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,791
and Gargantua, who faithfully
guards the fourth,

399
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:32,250
all of the Guardians have
gathered as requested,

400
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:35,166
and pledged their
undying loyalty.

401
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:39,083
Supreme One, we
await your orders.

402
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:42,958
You need but to ask it
of us, and it shall be done.

403
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:21,791
[AINS]
Magic... NPCs... Items...

404
00:24:21,875 --> 00:24:24,708
Now that the system of
the DMMO-RPG, Yggdrasil,

405
00:24:24,791 --> 00:24:28,083
has completely changed, I must
blindly nagvigate my way

406
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:30,250
through this new world
and put on a brave front

407
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:32,041
for my Guardians.

408
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:34,291
They have pledged their
loyalty to an absolute

409
00:24:34,375 --> 00:24:36,708
and Supreme Overlord.

410
00:24:36,791 --> 00:24:38,666
If I don't meet
their expectations,

411
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:41,125
it could be disastrous.

412
00:24:41,208 --> 00:24:46,000
I'll have to keep my composure
and move without error.

413
00:24:46,083 --> 00:24:49,458
Chapter two: "Floor Guardians."
