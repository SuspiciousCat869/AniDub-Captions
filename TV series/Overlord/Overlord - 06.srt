1
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:01,708
Um. Mr. Peter?

2
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:02,958
Yes?

3
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:05,458
Why don't we take a break,
around that area?

4
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,208
[PETER]
Good idea.

5
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,791
Mr. Momon.

6
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,500
[AINS]
I understand.

7
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:25,375
[PETER]
Enjoy this.

8
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:28,416
Things will get a little
dangerous from here on out.

9
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,500
[AINS] Don't worry about
us. We'll be careful.

10
00:01:31,583 --> 00:01:33,583
[MOMONGA] I'll have to be,
considering I can't use

11
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:35,583
most of my magic in this armor.

12
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:38,791
Playing the tank role was
never really my speed.

13
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:43,625
[MOMONGA] If things start
to get out of hand,

14
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:46,083
Narberal will use
fifth tier magic.

15
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:47,791
I'm not sure what
we'll be facing,

16
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:49,541
but hopefully, that
will be enough.

17
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:53,125
If not, I may have
to get serious.

18
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:55,083
Try not to look
so worried, Nabe.

19
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:57,083
Everthing'll be fine
as long as I'm here.

20
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:59,041
I'm the best set of eyes
and ears this side

Don't be shy. You can praise me.

00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:04,875
Can I squash him yet?

24
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,125
[AINS]
Nabe.

25
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,583
Mosquitos should be
handled without mercy.

26
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:09,291
Please, sir.

27
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:10,625
Harsh!

28
00:02:10,708 --> 00:02:14,500
But it's okay, gorgeous,
I so can tell you want me.

[PETER, NINYA, DYNE

30
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:18,416
You know, I just
realized something.

31
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,583
We've crossed into the Wise King
of the Forest's territory.

32
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:24,291
[AINS]
Who is this "Wise King"?

33
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:26,958
It's a very old and
powerful magical creature.

34
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:29,500
At least, that's
what the legends say.

35
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:32,375
Not only can it cast magic,
but it's physically strong.

36
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:34,583
And if its four razor claws
don't finish you off,

37
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:37,083
its snake tail will.

38
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:41,583
[AINS] Interesting. I think
I'd like to meet it.

39
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:22,875
[DEMIURGE breathes deeply]

40
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:33,750
[door clicks]

41
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:40,041
[ALBEDO sighing, moaning]

42
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:42,375
[DEMIURGE]
Albedo.

43
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:44,541
[ALBEDO gasps]

44
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:46,166
You have your
own accommodations,

45
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,166
why are you in Lord Ains' room?

46
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,666
I was rubbing my scent
into everything I could.

47
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,500
I wanted it to be the
first thing he smelled

48
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:55,708
when he finally returns.

49
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,500
[DEMIURGE] Considering he
doesn't require sleep,

50
00:04:57,583 --> 00:05:00,208
I doubt that will happen.

51
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:04,083
Fine, just, don't overdo it.

52
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:06,500
I'm sure I don't
know what you mean,

53
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:10,500
but we'll try. Right? Lord Ains?

54
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:13,250
Uh-- Ugh.

55
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:17,791
Is that... a life-sized
body pillow?

56
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,833
Yeah. Isn't it great?

57
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:21,500
--[DEMIURGE sighs]
--[ALBEDO] I made it myself.

58
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:23,166
Now I'm working on
the socks and clothes

59
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,791
for our first child.
I need to be prepared.

60
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:28,458
It won't be much
longer. I can feel it.

61
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:31,333
I've made enough for
the first five years.

62
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:33,000
Boy or girl,
they'll have everything

63
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,791
they could ask for.

64
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:39,083
Wait a minute, what if the
child doesn't have a gender?

65
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:41,000
If the elf twins
are any indication,

66
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,666
the Supreme Beings have no issue

67
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,416
with their
servants crossdressing.

68
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,208
Yes! You're right.

69
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:47,958
Thank you, Demiurge.

70
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:50,208
That's exactly what
I needed to hear!

71
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:54,375
[sighs] I'm always
happy to help.

72
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:57,750
[AINS] Such things are
actually possible?

73
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,041
[NINYA]
Yes.

74
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,083
You can make a lot
with creation magic,

75
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,708
even basics like salt and sugar.

76
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:05,916
There are also spells like
Alarm that can warn you

77
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,541
when danger is nearby.

78
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:12,083
[AINS]
I see. May I ask something else?

79
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:16,708
[MOMONGA] The more I know,
the more questions I have.

80
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:19,541
It seems their technology level
is that of the Middle Ages,

81
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:21,250
but the sophistication
of their magic

82
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:23,666
is on a completely
different level.

83
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:27,250
[LUKRUT]
I just realized.

84
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:31,666
You always seem
super relaxed, Nabe.

85
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,291
Is it because you know
that I'm keeping you safe?

86
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:38,125
It has nothing to do with
you. I'm with Mr. Momon.

87
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:46,291
[LUKRUT] So, what you're telling
me is that the two of you

88
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:47,583
are lovers after all?

89
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:49,791
[gasps] No, I never said that!

90
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:51,541
Stop putting words in my mouth!

91
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:53,416
Lady Albedo is the
only one he needs...!

92
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,625
[AINS] Stop, Nabe!
What are you thinking?

93
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:01,833
Uh...

94
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:05,000
[AINS clears throat] Mr. Lukrut,
please stop looking into

95
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:07,250
our personal lives.

96
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:10,375
Sure. My bad. Though,
from the sound of it,

97
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:12,583
you're one lucky
man, Mr. Momon.

98
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:15,333
[PETER] I'm sorry. He can be
really idiotic sometimes.

99
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:16,500
Please forgive him.

100
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,916
I promise he doesn't
mean any harm by it.

101
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,291
[AINS] It's fine. As long as
he's careful from now on.

102
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,791
We'll have no trouble.

103
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:27,750
You really need to stop delving
into people's business--

104
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,625
They're on the move.

Just past the tree line.

108
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,375
I don't think we'll be
able to avoid this fight.

109
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,333
It's going to get
rough very quickly.

110
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:50,750
The best thing you can do
is stay hidden in the cart.

'Kay. My life is in your hands.

112

Mr. Momon, what's the best
way to split the group up?

113
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:59,125
[AINS] All of you should
stay close to Nphirea.

114
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:03,166
I'll show him that our
services are worth every coin.

115
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,833
That sounds good to me.
But we're not just gonna watch.

116
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:08,375
You'll have all the extended
support we can muster.

117
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:10,625
[NINYA] If we go completely
defensive, most of them

118
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:12,375
will escape back
into the forest.

119
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,916
In that case, I say
we do the usual.

120
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,375
Pull the turtle's head out
of its shell and cut it off.

121
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:20,291
It's a sound strategy,
but still flawed.

122
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:23,375
Even though Mr. Momon will take
the brunt of their attack.

123
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:25,750
What about the ones
that get through?

124
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,166
That's easy.

125
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,916
I'll use my Fortress martial art
and hold back the ogres.

I was hoping you'd say that.

[PETER] Ninya, you'll protect
me with defensive magic.

129
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:38,625
Once I'm clear, focus on crowd
control and attack spells.

Right. No prob.

of any wayward goblins.

And if an Ogre gets
past me, take it out.

for you, Mr. Momon?

"Magic Arrow"!

[GOBLINS yell]

163
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,875
Here they come.

164
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:17,291
About time.

165
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:18,833
[AINS]
They're a skilled party.

166
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:20,333
They're aware of
each other's strengths

167
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:22,583
and work well together.

168
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:26,041
Still, they don't hold
a candle to my old allies.

169

[OGRE 6H roars]

[AINS grunts]

171
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:33,958
[GOBLINS]
Hm?

172
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:37,583
[AINS]
Nabe, your turn.

173
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:38,708
Right.

174
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,791
"Chain Lightning."

175
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:49,041
[OGRES groan]

176
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:52,666
Uh!

177
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,375
[LUKRUT]
Hey!

178
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:55,041
Don't let them escape!

179
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:02,125
"Minor Healing Light."

180
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,916
[AINS]
Are the ears valuable?

181
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,833
Not on their own, but
you can exchange them

182
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:13,041
and other parts for a
reward from the guild.

183
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:14,791
It can be pretty lucrative.

184
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,958
[AINS] So crystals or
rare trinkets don't just

185
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:18,958
randomly drop from them?

186
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:20,708
To be honest, I've
never even heard

187
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:23,500
of ogres carrying
crystals or trinkets.

188
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:26,000
[AINS]
I see.

189
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:28,166
You were pretty
amazing back there.

190
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,500
The two of you are far more
skilled than we expected.

191
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,291
[LUKRUT] I wouldn't mind
having a sword like that.

192
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:37,000
I've seen incredible
fighters before,

193
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:38,916
but I wouldn't be surprised
if you're stronger

194
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,541
than the royal head warrior.

195
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,291
Far stronger.

196
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:44,083
It's moments like
these that remind me

197
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:46,500
there is always a
bigger fish in the sea.

198
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:47,666
[AINS]
Don't worry.

199
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,500
In time, your team
will be able to defeat

200
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,541
even greater odds with ease.

201
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:53,958
[NINYA]
Uh?

202
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:57,083
[DYNE, PETER, LUKRUT chuckle]

203
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:05,750
[ADVENTURERS laughing]

204
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:07,333
[DYNE]
I think you got the worst of it.

205
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:08,375
[LUKRUT]
Oh, yeah?

206
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:10,291
Well, you didn't
see the other guy!

207
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:12,166
[DYNE chuckles]

208
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,375
[NPHIREA laughs]

209
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:16,250
[MOMONGA]
Crap. What should I do?

210
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:19,333
If I drink it, it'll
go between my bones.

211
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:22,208
What's the matter?
I-Is the soup too hot?

212
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,708
[LUKRUT] If that's the
case, I can let it cool

213
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:30,416
in my mouth first and
feed it to you that way.

214
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,208
Uh...

215
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:35,416
[AINS] The food's fine,
we're just observing

216
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,416
a religious custom. In our
faith, it's considered impolite

217
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,291
to eat with several
people the same day

218
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:43,083
we take another's life.

219
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:46,125
Oh. You believe in some
interesting teachings,

220
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:49,666
Master Momon. I respect that.

221
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,000
[AINS]
I've been wondering.

222
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:54,333
Where did the name "Swords
of Darkness" come from?

223
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,666
Oh, that. Tell 'em, Ninya.

224
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,875
Don't make me!
I was young and stupid!

225
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:03,625
It really is nothing
to be embarrassed about.

226
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:08,208
That's easy for you to say.
You didn't come up with it.

227
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:09,750
[PETER]
Anyway.

228
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:13,625
It's a reference to the old
legends, The Thirteen Heroes.

229
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:15,125
We named our party
after the swords

230
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:17,375
of one of the fabled warriors.

231
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:20,500
[MOMONGA]
Huh? Is that all?

232
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:22,833
Crap. He must expect
me to know it.

233
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:24,041
What do I do?

234
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,541
I don't know them. Who are they?

235
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:26,875
[MOMONGA]
Oh, thank you!

236
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:29,041
Here I thought everyone
knew the legends.

237
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:31,666
Among The Thirteen Heroes,
there was one called

238
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,166
the "Black Knight" who
wielded four powerful swords

239
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:37,083
known only as "The
Swords of Darkness."

240
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,333
See, when we started
our little group,

241
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:42,166
our ultimate goal was
to find the swords

242
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,041
for ourselves someday.

243
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:47,375
But, we needed a
symbol in the meantime.

244
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:51,291
So we carry these
daggers as placeholders.

245
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:54,541
I don't care that these
aren't the real deal.

246
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,541
They represent the
creation of our team,

247
00:13:56,625 --> 00:14:00,791
and that's more important to
me than any mythical blade.

248
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:03,250
You know, I think that's
the first time Lukrut

249
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,375
has said something
mildly meaningful.

250
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,083
[LUKRUT]
Hey! Take that back!

251
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:09,583
[PETER] Who are you and
what'd you do with our friend?

252
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:10,750
[LUKRUT]
Shut up!

253
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,583
I'm a silver-tongued
fox and you know it.

254
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,833
[MOMONGA]
I used to be like them.

255
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:18,875
I adventured with my friends,
collected materials,

256
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,708
and helped build Nazarick.

257
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:24,291
You all seem very close.

258
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:26,958
Is it common for
adventurers to get along?

259
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:29,833
Yeah! We all trust
each other with our lives.

260
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:32,625
[LUKRUT] It helps that our
team is nothing but guys, too.

261
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:36,666
Throwing a girl into the
mix would be distracting.

262
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,500
I think our greatest
strength comes from

263
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:39,666
sharing a common goal.

264
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,041
It keeps us focused
on the future.

265
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,541
[AINS]
You're lucky.

266
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:46,333
Amazing things happen when
everyone shares the same goal.

267
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:48,958
Were you on a team, Mr. Momon?

268
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:54,041
[AINS] It wasn't as an
adventurer, but, yes, I was.

269
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:57,625
Once, when I was weak
and alone, a holy knight

270
00:14:57,708 --> 00:15:00,916
clad in white armor
saved my life.

271
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,791
He led me to the people
I would eventually

272
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:06,666
call my comrades.
It changed me forever.

273
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:11,500
[AINS] They were the best
allies I could ever hope for.

274
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:15,041
More than that.
They were friends, family.

275
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:17,416
I will never forget the
days I spent with them,

276
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,875
as long as I live.

277
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:24,125
[MOMONGA] Ains Ooal Gown,
you were the world to me.

278
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,916
Mr. Momon. Don't worry.

279
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,333
I'm sure that you'll find
more allies just like them,

280
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:32,333
one of these days.

281
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:34,500
[AINS]
That day will never come.

282
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,333
[AINS]
Excuse me.

283
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:42,041
[AINS]
Nabe, I'm eating over here.

284
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:45,041
Yes, I think I'll
join you as well.

285
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:47,041
I hope you enjoy it.

286
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,000
[NINYA] I think I might
have insulted him.

287
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:06,125
[DYNE] Mm. Something bad
must have happened.

288
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:11,375
[PETER] If I had to guess,
they're probably all gone.

289
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:14,791
He has the aura of someone
who's lost all of his comrades.

290
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:17,291
That feeling stays with you.

291
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:21,041
[LUKRUT]
I bet. It's hard to imagine.

292
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,791
You can't take back
what you've said,

293
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:25,083
so don't fret over it.

294
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:28,375
All you can do from this point
is atone through your actions.

295
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:31,541
Work hard to paint over this
mistake, and move forward.

296
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:34,416
[NINYA]
Mm-hm. I'll do my best.

297
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,958
[NINYA]
I don't understand

298
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:40,083
how I could have
been so thoughtless.

299
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:44,125
I know what it's like
to lose someone you love.

300
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:45,833
Right, sis?

301
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,166
That fight was intense

302
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:52,375
and Mr. Momon was incredible!
Who knew he was so strong?

303
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:54,291
I know! He was something else.

304
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:56,708
I've never seen
anything like it before.

305
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:58,833
[NPHIREA] He stopped that
ogre with one strike.

306
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:01,208
It must take serious
skill to pull that off.

307
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:02,666
Yeah, serious skill.

308
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,833
Momon could probably give
even the Royal Head Warrior

309
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:06,083
a run for his money.

310
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:07,291
[NPHIREA]
Huh?

311
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:09,375
But that would make
him adamantite class!

312
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:11,416
Do you actually believe
he's the same level

313
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,208
as the strongest
adventurers in the world?

314
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:15,583
That's what I'm saying.

315
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:17,708
--[NINYA] Mm-hm.
--Yes.

316
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:19,708
[NPHIREA]
Amazing.

317
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:22,583
[PETER] I didn't think much
of him when we first met.

318
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:25,666
Well, I was a bit jealous of
his full set of plate armor.

319
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,375
[LUKRUT] Fess up, you were
ogling Nabe like the rest of us.

320
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:30,791
Yeah, right.

321
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:34,083
But now, after seeing
his skills first hand,

322
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:36,083
I can't help feeling inadequate.

323
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:38,208
Hey, he's got a
few years on you.

324
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,291
It's entirely possible
that he's been training

325
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:41,666
for much longer.

326
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,333
Hold on, how do you know
that he's older than Peter?

327
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:46,416
Back in town, he
took his helmet off

328
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,833
for a moment, and
we got a good look.

329
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:49,125
[NPHIREA]
What country is he from?

330
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:50,458
I need to know!

331
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:52,833
Sorry, we didn't
ask for specifics.

332
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:54,666
He's the same race
as Nabe, which might be

333
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,500
why they're together,
but she could get easily

334
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:57,958
get someone much hotter.

335
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:00,125
I doubt that his
looks are an issue.

336
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:01,750
Besides, with skills like that.

337
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,625
I'm pretty sure he doesn't
have trouble getting

338
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:04,958
with women of any race.

339
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:07,166
Women instinctively flock
to men with strength,

340
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,958
no matter their looks.
It's a fact of life, my friend.

341
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:12,250
[sighs]

342
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:17,166
[DYNE] Master Nphirea?
Is something wrong?

343
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,916
[NPHIREA] It's really
not all that important.

344
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,250
I just feel a bit uneasy.

345
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:29,958
[NPHIREA] Is Mr. Momon
really popular with women?

346
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:31,958
Putting aside his
physical looks,

347
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:34,125
his strength is the real deal.

348
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:36,333
And, judging by the quality
of his swords and armor,

349
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,833
he's obviously quite wealthy.

350
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:40,541
Oh...

351
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:45,333
All right, spill it.

352
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:48,500
[NPHIREA]
Well. There's this girl.

353
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:50,875
I can't help being afraid
that she might fall for him

354
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:53,625
once we get to Carne.

355
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:56,333
It's stupid, I know.

356
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:57,416
Is that all?!

Just keep trying. If you
give up, it's all over.

Why are you doing this?

375
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:59,333
Because you peddle
information, and I need

some on a talented pharmacist.

You want Nphiera Balear.

Oh, silly man.

You could be lying to me.
I should be thorough.

If you want proof,

all you have to do is
ask the other brokers!

[CLEMENTINE] That Jewel

at making zombies.

Precisely.

The same ritual that our

If done correctly,
it will turn the capital
