00:19:02.174 --> 00:19:06.578
HUH?

00:19:06.578 --> 00:19:09.047
OH, WELL...
NO BIG DEAL.

00:19:09.047 --> 00:19:12.017
MY DECK'S STILL
UNSTOPPABLE.

00:19:12.017 --> 00:19:15.254
[THINKING]
I HOPE YUGI'S ALL RIGHT.

00:19:15.254 --> 00:19:16.455

00:19:16.455 --> 00:19:17.456
HUH?

00:19:17.456 --> 00:19:18.457
EH?

00:19:18.457 --> 00:19:19.458
HUH?

00:19:19.458 --> 00:19:22.795
Tristan: HEY! IT'S YUGI!

00:19:22.795 --> 00:19:24.663
PHARAOH! OVER THERE!

00:19:24.663 --> 00:19:26.598
THEY MADE IT OUT!

00:19:26.598 --> 00:19:28.066

00:19:35.474 --> 00:19:36.875

00:19:37.876 --> 00:19:39.178
HEY, MAN!

00:19:39.178 --> 00:19:40.379

00:19:43.749 --> 00:19:45.784
IS IT REALLY

00:19:45.784 --> 00:19:47.119
YUP. WE'RE SAFE NOW.

00:19:47.119 --> 00:19:48.687
HEY, YUGI!

00:19:48.687 --> 00:19:51.824
LET'S HIT
DA HIGH ROAD, FOLKS!

00:19:51.824 --> 00:19:54.059
I'M SURE THERE'S SOMEONE ELSE
TRYIN' TA TAKE OVA THE WORLD

00:19:54.059 --> 00:19:55.227
BACK HOME!

00:19:55.227 --> 00:19:56.628
YOU KNOW,
THE SCARY THING IS,

00:19:56.628 --> 00:20:01.900
HE'S PROBABLY RIGHT.

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:03.001
HUH?

00:20:03.001 --> 00:20:05.471
Tea: YUGI,
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

00:20:05.471 --> 00:20:11.109
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE, TEA.

00:20:11.109 --> 00:20:12.744
[THINKING]
WE MAY HAVE
STOPPED DARTZ,

00:20:12.744 --> 00:20:14.913
BUT THE PHARAOH'S
NOT DONE YET.

00:20:14.913 --> 00:20:16.682
NOW HE HAS TO PICK UP
WHERE HE LEFT OFF

00:20:16.682 --> 00:20:18.817
BEFORE ALL THIS
CRAZINESS STARTED

00:20:18.817 --> 00:20:21.820
'CAUSE THE BIGGEST
ADVENTURE OF ALL
IS STILL AHEAD.

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:23.355
AND IT WON'T BE OVER
TILL THE PHARAOH

00:20:23.355 --> 00:20:25.491
UNLOCKS THE SECRETS
OF HIS PAST.

00:20:25.491 --> 00:20:27.526
HE NEEDS TO LEARN
WHO HE REALLY IS

00:20:27.526 --> 00:20:29.795
AND WHY HE WAS
SENT BACK HERE.

00:20:29.795 --> 00:20:33.398
MAYBE THEN HIS SPIRIT'LL
FINALLY BE ABLE TO REST.

00:20:33.398 --> 00:20:35.701
WELL, NO MATTER
WHAT HAPPENS,

00:20:35.701 --> 00:20:37.936
ONE THING'S FOR SURE...

00:20:37.936 --> 00:20:39.705
WHATEVER HE
FINDS OUT THERE...

00:20:39.705 --> 00:20:42.074
AND WHATEVER
HE NEEDS TO FACE...

00:20:42.074 --> 00:20:44.309
HE WON'T HAVE TO
DO IT ALONE.
