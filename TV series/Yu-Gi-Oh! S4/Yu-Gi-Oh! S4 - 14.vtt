[SCREAMING]

00:02:44.197 --> 00:02:47.033
YOU WERE A FOOL

FOR WHEN YOU LOSE,

00:02:49.035 --> 00:02:51.971

ALL I NEED TO DO

00:02:58.445 --> 00:03:01.147
IS CORRECTLY GUESS
THE NAME OF A CARD

00:03:01.147 --> 00:03:02.882
AND I CAN ACTIVATE IT!

00:03:02.882 --> 00:03:05.185
AND SINCE I GAVE YOU
THE NECROMANCY CARD,

00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:07.120
I KNOW
YOU'RE HOLDING IT!

SO I CAN SUMMON
MY DARK MAGICIAN!

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.882
THEN I'LL SEPARATE
MY KURIBABYLON

00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:37.650
INTO THE 5
KURIBOH BROTHERS

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.055

ENHANCES MY CREATURES
WITH 500 EXTRA POINTS!

00:04:05.011 --> 00:04:07.714

500 EXTRA POINTS,

FOR A GRAND TOTAL OF
2,500 ATTACK POINTS!

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:24.497
AND ALL OF THAT POWER
WAS ABSORBED

00:04:24.497 --> 00:04:29.569
BY MY KURIBABYLON!

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:32.972
THAT'S ONE POWERFUL
COTTON BALL
YOU'VE GOT THERE.

00:04:32.972 --> 00:04:36.142
IT'S ALL THANKS
TO THE POWER OF
THE ORICHALCOS!

00:04:36.142 --> 00:04:39.646
WRONG!
THE POWER COMES FROM
THE DARKNESS IN YOU!

00:04:47.787 --> 00:04:49.622
HEY, WHERE AM I?

00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:52.058

HOW COULD YOU, PHARAOH?

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:59.065
Yami-Yugi:
I DON'T CARE WHERE
THIS POWER CAME FROM!

00:04:59.065 --> 00:05:01.935
ALL THAT MATTERS IS,
IT'S MINE NOW!

00:05:05.505 --> 00:05:08.575
NO! MY GUARDIAN!

00:05:08.575 --> 00:05:11.444
AND NOW THAT
YOU HAVE A MONSTER
IN YOUR GRAVEYARD...

00:05:11.444 --> 00:05:15.281
YOUR MAGIC CARD
LOSES ITS POWER!

00:05:15.281 --> 00:05:17.450
I'M FAR FROM DONE.

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:21.321

HASN'T HAD HIS CHANCE
TO MAKE YOU SUFFER!

00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:24.157
GO DARK MAGIC ATTACK!

WHAT'S THAT?!

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:32.065
A HANDY MAGIC CARD.

00:05:32.065 --> 00:05:34.968
IT ALLOWS ME TO STOP
YOUR DARK MAGICIAN'S ATTACK

00:05:34.968 --> 00:05:36.536
BEFORE IT REACHES MY MONSTER

00:05:36.536 --> 00:05:39.439
AS LONG AS I'M WILLING
TO SEND TWO OF MY CARDS

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:41.674
TO THE GRAVEYARD AS PAYMENT.

00:05:48.615 --> 00:05:51.184

Duke: YEAH?
THEN WHY DON'T
YOU TWO FILL US IN.

00:06:05.098 --> 00:06:06.566
Tristan:
I DON'T TRUST
THESE TWERPS

00:06:06.566 --> 00:06:08.001
AS FAR AS
I CAN THROW 'EM.

00:06:08.001 --> 00:06:09.435
Joey: HEY!

00:06:09.435 --> 00:06:11.371
MY BEST BUDDY'S GOT

00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:13.106
AND I WANT
ANSWERS NOW!

00:06:13.106 --> 00:06:16.709
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
YOUR PAWS OFF ME
AND TRY ASKING NICELY!

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:19.746
WRONG ANSWER.

DON'T HURT ME,

00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:22.615
IT'S THE SEAL
OF ORICHALCOS!

00:06:22.615 --> 00:06:26.119
YUGI GOT IT FROM
THAT BIG MUSCLE GUY
AND THEN ACTIVATED IT!

00:06:26.119 --> 00:06:27.153
OH!
OH!
HUH?

00:06:27.153 --> 00:06:28.588
[GASPING]

00:06:28.588 --> 00:06:30.390
Joey: YUGI
WOULDN'T DO DAT!

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.025
HE KNOWS
DAT CARD'S EVIL!

00:06:38.831 --> 00:06:40.900
Rafael:
HOW DOES IT FEEL TO KNOW

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.303
THAT ALL THIS TIME YOU'VE BEEN
HIDING YOUR TRUE SELF!?

00:06:43.303 --> 00:06:45.805
YOU DERIVE YOUR POWERS
FROM DARKNESS,

00:06:45.805 --> 00:06:48.174
AND YOU ALWAYS HAVE!

00:06:48.174 --> 00:06:49.475
WHAT'S WRONG?

00:06:49.475 --> 00:06:50.944
ARE YOU JEALOUS

00:06:50.944 --> 00:06:53.713
BECAUSE THE SEAL
OF ORICHALCOS
RESIDES WITH ME NOW,

00:06:53.713 --> 00:06:57.650
AND IT'S YOUR SOUL
THAT'S ON THE LINE
THIS TIME!?

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:59.953
PERHAPS YOU SHOULD
HAVE THOUGHT TWICE

00:06:59.953 --> 00:07:03.323
BEFORE TURNING
THAT MAGIC CARD
OVER TO ME, RAFAEL.

00:07:03.323 --> 00:07:07.126
THE SEAL MAY BE STRONG,
BUT I'M NOT WORRIED.

00:07:07.126 --> 00:07:09.896
I HAVE COMPLETE TRUST
IN MY MONSTERS.

00:07:09.896 --> 00:07:13.232
THEY WON'T LET ME DOWN.

00:07:13.232 --> 00:07:17.103
MY GUARDIAN MAY BE GONE...
BUT HE'LL BE BACK!

00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:20.606
JUST YOU WAIT!

00:07:20.606 --> 00:07:22.608
IN FACT, YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

00:07:22.608 --> 00:07:25.611
I ACTIVATE...
MY MONSTER REBIRTH!

00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:30.383
THIS MAGIC CARD ALLOWS ME
TO BRING ONE MONSTER BACK
FROM MY GRAVEYARD

00:07:30.383 --> 00:07:32.418
AND PLACE IT IN MY DECK!

00:07:32.418 --> 00:07:34.954
AND I CHOOSE GUARDIAN GRARL!

00:07:34.954 --> 00:07:37.890
I DESTROYED
THAT MONSTER ONCE
AND I'LL DO IT AGAIN!

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:39.359
NOW FINISH YOUR MOVE.

00:07:39.359 --> 00:07:42.562
NEXT I'LL PLACE ONE CARD
FACE DOWN ON THE FIELD...

00:07:42.562 --> 00:07:43.863

ALRIGHT, GUYS,
IF YUGI LOSES,

00:07:57.143 --> 00:07:59.379
I CALL DIBS ON

THAT'S NOT COOL.

00:08:00.847 --> 00:08:03.449
WHY DONCHA SHOW
SOME COMPASSION
FOR A CHANGE...

00:08:03.449 --> 00:08:05.051
AND LET ME TAKE
HIS DARK MAGICIAN.

00:08:05.051 --> 00:08:06.152
WATCH IT!

00:08:06.152 --> 00:08:08.588
YOUR SWORDS
MEAN NOTHING!

00:08:08.588 --> 00:08:11.357
FOR I PLAY
CATAPULT TURTLE!

00:08:11.357 --> 00:08:14.260
BY SACRIFICING
MY BIG SHIELD GARDNA!

00:08:18.965 --> 00:08:21.734
NOW I USE MY TURTLE'S
SPECIAL ABILITY

00:08:21.734 --> 00:08:23.770
TO CATAPULT
ANY MONSTER I CHOOSE

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:25.271
FROM MY SIDE
OF THE FIELD

00:08:25.271 --> 00:08:29.876
DIRECTLY AT YOUR
LIFE POINTS, RAFAEL!

00:08:29.876 --> 00:08:32.712
YOU'VE ACTIVATED MY TRAP!

00:08:32.712 --> 00:08:34.480
LIMIT TRIBUTE!

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.715
WHAT'S THAT!?

00:08:35.715 --> 00:08:38.518
IT CHANGES THE RULES
OF THE COMPETITION

00:08:38.518 --> 00:08:41.888
BY LIMITING THE NUMBER
OF MONSTERS EACH PLAYER
CAN SACRIFICE

00:08:41.888 --> 00:08:43.623
TO ONE MONSTER PER TURN!

00:08:43.623 --> 00:08:45.725
OH WELL!

00:08:45.725 --> 00:08:47.693
I GUESS I END MY TURN.

00:08:47.693 --> 00:08:49.629
I THOUGHT YOU'D SAY THAT.

00:08:49.629 --> 00:08:52.965
HA HA HA HA! YES!

00:08:52.965 --> 00:08:55.435
NOW I ACTIVATE
NIGHTMARE BINDING!

00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:03.209
NO!

00:09:03.209 --> 00:09:05.411
I'M AFRAID SO, PHARAOH!

00:09:05.411 --> 00:09:08.548
YOUR KURIBABYLON
JUST LOST 800 POINTS.

00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:10.116
BUT THEY DIDN'T GO TO WASTE

00:09:10.116 --> 00:09:12.652
'CAUSE THOSE ATTACK POINTS
GOT ADDED TO MY LIFE POINTS!

00:09:12.652 --> 00:09:14.454
AND TO TOP IT OFF,

00:09:14.454 --> 00:09:17.690
YOUR OVERSIZED DUST BUNNY
CAN'T BE SACRIFICED!

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:20.593
INSULT MY MONSTERS
ALL YOU LIKE, RAFAEL.

00:09:20.593 --> 00:09:22.895
WITH THE POWER OF
THE ORICHALCOS BEHIND ME

00:09:22.895 --> 00:09:26.732
I CAN'T BE STOPPED!

00:09:26.732 --> 00:09:28.101
SINCE HE'S USELESS

00:09:28.101 --> 00:09:31.804
I'LL SACRIFICE
MY DARK MAGICIAN!

00:09:31.804 --> 00:09:35.875
AND BY USING THE SPECIAL ABILITY
OF MY CATAPULT TURTLE,

00:09:35.875 --> 00:09:38.111
I'LL DAMAGE YOUR LIFE POINTS!

00:09:44.784 --> 00:09:46.352
NOW THAT HE'S GONE,

00:09:46.352 --> 00:09:48.788
MY DARK MAGICIAN
CAN ACTUALLY
SERVE A PURPOSE

00:09:48.788 --> 00:09:52.325
BY STRENGTHENING MY
DARK MAGICIAN GIRL!

00:09:52.325 --> 00:09:55.194
Joey:
DAT DOESN'T SOUND
LIKE DA YUGI I KNOW.

00:09:55.194 --> 00:09:57.897
COME ON PAL...
SNAP OUT OF IT!

00:09:57.897 --> 00:10:00.133
WELL, HERE WE ARE...

00:10:00.133 --> 00:10:02.368
YOU'RE JUST ABOUT
TO LOSE THE DUEL...

00:10:02.368 --> 00:10:03.903
AND YOUR SOUL!

00:10:03.903 --> 00:10:08.107
ONE MORE BLAST FROM
MY CATAPULT TURTLE,
AND IT'S OVER!

00:10:11.677 --> 00:10:15.281
YOU DON'T SCARE ME!

00:10:15.281 --> 00:10:17.683
I'LL PLAY THIS,
AND END MY TURN.

00:10:17.683 --> 00:10:21.587
HA HA HA HA!
THEN ALL I HAVE TO DO
IS DESTROY ONE CARD!

00:10:21.587 --> 00:10:24.390
AND THIS DUEL'S DONE.

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:25.591
I CHOOSE...

00:10:25.591 --> 00:10:30.463
MY VERY OWN
DARK MAGICIAN GIRL!

00:10:30.463 --> 00:10:32.098
PHARAOH! NO!

00:10:32.098 --> 00:10:35.501
THE SEAL OF ORICHALCOS
IS IN PLAY!

00:10:35.501 --> 00:10:38.437
SO THE MONSTERS
ON THE FIELD ARE REAL!

00:10:38.437 --> 00:10:41.674
PLEASE DON'T SACRIFICE
THE DARK MAGICIAN GIRL!

00:10:41.674 --> 00:10:44.377
GO ON!

00:10:44.377 --> 00:10:46.345
FIRE CATAPULT!

00:10:52.985 --> 00:10:56.455
I ACTIVATE MY SHRINK CARD!

00:10:56.455 --> 00:10:57.790
NO, NOT THAT CARD!

00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:00.359
Weevil:
DARK MAGICIAN GIRL
LOSES HALF HER POINTS!

00:11:00.359 --> 00:11:02.328
HE SAVED HIMSELF!

00:11:02.328 --> 00:11:04.096
[SCREAMING]

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:09.669
IMPRESSIVE...

00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:12.838
BUT ALL YOU DID
WAS PROLONG YOUR
EVENTUAL DOWNFALL.

00:11:12.838 --> 00:11:14.273
HA HA HA!

00:11:14.273 --> 00:11:16.409
YOU'LL NEVER
ESCAPE THE SEAL!

00:11:16.409 --> 00:11:20.246
IT SEEMS YOUR SWORDS
OF REVEALING LIGHT
JUST EXPIRED.

00:11:20.246 --> 00:11:23.616
SO ONCE I SACRIFICE
ANOTHER OF MY MONSTERS,

00:11:23.616 --> 00:11:26.652
YOUR SPIRIT WILL BE
ABSORBED BY THE SEAL,

00:11:26.652 --> 00:11:29.021
TRAPPING YOU FOREVER!

00:11:33.025 --> 00:11:35.328
Yami-Yugi:
THE WORLD'S STRONGEST
FORCE ANSWERS TO ME!

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:38.698
OH MAN.
OH MAN.

00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:42.501
Duke: IT LOOKS LIKE
YUGI'S GOT THIS DUEL
IN THE BAG!

00:11:42.501 --> 00:11:46.339
YOU GO YUGI!
NICE MOVES, HAH?

00:11:46.339 --> 00:11:49.742
EARTH TO JOEY...
ARE YOU THERE, MAN?

00:11:49.742 --> 00:11:53.279
I'M HERE,
BUT YUGE'S NOT.
HE'S BRAINWASHED!

00:11:53.279 --> 00:11:54.480
SAY WHAT?!

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:57.416
HE'S SACRIFICING
HIS MONSTAS
LEFT AND RIGHT

00:11:57.416 --> 00:11:59.252
AND TAWKIN' ABOUT
"POWER."

00:11:59.252 --> 00:12:01.954
THAT'S NOT YUGI'S
STYLE A DUELIN'
AT ALL!

00:12:01.954 --> 00:12:04.824
DAT ORICHALCOS DING
IS MESSIN' WIT HIS HEAD!

00:12:04.824 --> 00:12:07.360
JUST LIKE IT DID TA MAI!

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:10.796
HA HA HA HA!

00:12:10.796 --> 00:12:12.932
HOW COULD HE DO THIS?

00:12:12.932 --> 00:12:16.636
THAT CARD IS EVIL.
I WARNED HIM.

00:12:16.636 --> 00:12:19.171
Rafael: HA HA HA HA!

00:12:19.171 --> 00:12:22.008
I TOLD YOU THE SEAL
WOULD REVEAL THE TRUTH.

00:12:22.008 --> 00:12:24.076
THIS IS YOU--

00:12:24.076 --> 00:12:28.014
WICKED, GREEDY
AND FULL OF HATE.

00:12:28.014 --> 00:12:31.417
THE POWER OF
THE ORICHALCOS
REVEALS ALL.

00:12:31.417 --> 00:12:33.319
AND JUST
AS I SUSPECTED...

00:12:33.319 --> 00:12:37.256
YOU'RE EVIL, PHARAOH.

00:12:37.256 --> 00:12:39.592
AND YOU'RE GETTING WORSE.

00:12:39.592 --> 00:12:41.927
AS TIME PASSES
THE DARKNESS GROWS.

00:12:41.927 --> 00:12:43.062
NO!

00:12:43.062 --> 00:12:44.764
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME

00:12:44.764 --> 00:12:47.533
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS
LOOK AROUND THE FIELD.

00:12:47.533 --> 00:12:49.769
SEE WHAT YOU'VE DONE
TO YOUR MONSTERS?

00:12:49.769 --> 00:12:52.672
AT ONE TIME THEY WERE PURE.

00:12:52.672 --> 00:12:58.944
BUT NOW THEY'RE EVIL
SHADOW CREATURES!

00:12:58.944 --> 00:13:01.547
DID I REALLY DO
ALL THIS?

00:13:01.547 --> 00:13:03.449
MY KURIBOHS!

00:13:07.486 --> 00:13:10.489
OH NO! YOU DECEIVED ME!

00:13:10.489 --> 00:13:12.892
YOU CHOSE TO PLAY
THE SEAL OF ORICHALCOS,

00:13:12.892 --> 00:13:16.429
EVEN AT THE COST
OF LOSING TIMAEUS!

00:13:16.429 --> 00:13:20.866
YOUR LUST FOR POWER
DESTROYED A VALUABLE MONSTER.

00:13:20.866 --> 00:13:23.736
ONLY A TRULY DARK INDIVIDUAL

00:13:23.736 --> 00:13:26.772
WOULD HAVE SUCH A BLATANT
DISREGARD FOR HIS DECK.

00:13:26.772 --> 00:13:27.973
ENOUGH!!

00:13:27.973 --> 00:13:29.575
NOT TO WORRY!

00:13:29.575 --> 00:13:32.878
SOMEONE'S GONNA LOSE
IN THIS NEXT ROUND,

00:13:32.878 --> 00:13:34.747
AND THIS NIGHTMARE'LL
BE OVER!

00:13:38.884 --> 00:13:43.389
THERE'S ONLY ONE CARD
THAT CAN SAVE ME.

00:13:43.389 --> 00:13:45.991
I ACTIVATE CELESTIAL SWORD!

00:13:51.564 --> 00:13:54.800
AND TO USE MY SWORD I PLAY...

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.836
GUARDIAN EATOS!

00:14:14.387 --> 00:14:15.821
OF COURSE!

00:14:15.821 --> 00:14:20.025
THAT'S THE MONSTER
I'VE BEEN SENSING
ALL ALONG!

00:14:20.025 --> 00:14:23.863
ACTIVATE YOUR
SPECIAL ABILITY EATOS!

00:14:23.863 --> 00:14:30.736
SPIRIT OF CELESTIAL SWORD!

00:14:30.736 --> 00:14:36.575
I'M...LOSING...
CONTROL...

00:14:36.575 --> 00:14:37.710
AAH!
AAH!

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:39.845
WHAT'S
GOIN' ON!?

00:14:39.845 --> 00:14:42.915
Rafael:
MY GUARDIAN EATOS
HAS THE ABILITY

00:14:42.915 --> 00:14:45.818
TO REMOVE MONSTERS
FROM YOUR CARD GRAVEYARD

00:14:45.818 --> 00:14:48.154
AND ABSORB
THEIR ATTACK POWER!

00:14:48.154 --> 00:14:50.022
NOT MY MONSTERS!

00:14:50.022 --> 00:14:51.323
Rafael:
TOO LITTLE TOO LATE!

00:14:51.323 --> 00:14:57.396
NOW LET'S SEE
WHO'S UP FIRST!

00:14:57.396 --> 00:14:59.799
MY DARK MAGICIAN GIRL!

00:14:59.799 --> 00:15:05.905
NEXT HE'LL TAKE
YOUR FAVORITE MONSTER!

00:15:05.905 --> 00:15:08.140
NOT MY DARK MAGICIAN!

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:11.010
NEXT VICTIMS ARE
YOUR BIG SHIELD GARDNA,

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:13.946
GAZELLE, AND BERFOMET!

00:15:18.083 --> 00:15:22.888
YOU HAVE THE POWER
OF EVERY ONE OF
MY FALLEN MONSTERS!

00:15:22.888 --> 00:15:24.857
IT'S YOUR OWN FAULT!

00:15:24.857 --> 00:15:26.959
YOU DID THIS TO THEM

00:15:26.959 --> 00:15:32.832
WHEN YOU SELFISHLY
SACRIFICED
EACH ONE OF THEM!

00:15:32.832 --> 00:15:35.401
YOU LET YOUR RAGE
TAKE OVER.

00:15:35.401 --> 00:15:38.170
NOW LOOK INTO THE EYES
OF YOUR MONSTERS!

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:47.980
PLEASE FORGIVE ME FOR
WHAT I'VE DONE TO YOU!!

00:15:52.418 --> 00:15:56.055
Rafael:
YOU DISRESPECTED
YOUR MONSTERS!

00:15:56.055 --> 00:15:58.657
AND IT'S TIME
TO PAY THE PRICE NOW.

00:15:58.657 --> 00:16:01.961
YOUR FAVORITE CARDS
ARE FIGHTING ON MY SIDE!

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:12.771
YOUR OLD PALS JUST ADDED
THEIR POWER TO MY GUARDIAN!

00:16:12.771 --> 00:16:17.309
10,000 POINTS! THAT'S MORE
THAN ENOUGH TO WIPE YOU OUT!

00:16:17.309 --> 00:16:19.879
NOW, GUARDIAN EATOS!

00:16:19.879 --> 00:16:21.514
DESTROY HIS MONSTERS

00:16:21.514 --> 00:16:23.816
AND THE REST OF
HIS LIFE POINTS!

00:16:38.397 --> 00:16:42.902
NOOOOOOOOOO!

00:16:42.902 --> 00:16:46.338
Rex: NO WAY!
YUGI ACTUALLY LOST!

00:16:46.338 --> 00:16:48.807
Duke:
THIS CAN'T BE!

00:16:48.807 --> 00:16:49.975
Tristan:
OH MAN!

00:16:49.975 --> 00:16:51.210
Joey:
YUGI!

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:53.646
IF HE LOST THE DUEL...

00:16:53.646 --> 00:16:56.115
THEN HE LOSES HIS SOUL!

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:08.394
Rafael: HA HA HA HA!

00:17:08.394 --> 00:17:12.798
TIME FOR YOU
TO PAY UP, PHARAOH.

00:17:12.798 --> 00:17:16.535
THE SEAL OF ORICHALCOS
NEVER LEAVES THE FIELD

00:17:16.535 --> 00:17:18.938
WITHOUT TAKING SOMETHING
ALONG FOR THE RIDE!

00:17:18.938 --> 00:17:21.941
AND THIS TIME, IT'S YOU!

00:17:21.941 --> 00:17:24.276
'N YOU HAVE YOURSELF
TO BLAME,

00:17:24.276 --> 00:17:28.814
'CAUSE YOU SEALED
YOUR OWN FATE WHEN
YOU PLAYED THAT CARD.

00:17:28.814 --> 00:17:32.184
NOW YOUR LIFE FORCE
WILL AWAKEN THE GREAT BEAST.

00:17:32.184 --> 00:17:36.121
NOT IF I CAN HELP IT!

00:17:36.121 --> 00:17:39.491
WITH ALL THE POWER
OF THE MILLENNIUM PUZZLE...

00:17:39.491 --> 00:17:40.726
I BREAK THE SEAL!

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:54.573
PHARAOH! I WON'T LET
THIS HAPPEN TO YOU!

00:17:54.573 --> 00:17:55.808
YUGI! NO!

00:17:55.808 --> 00:17:57.710
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE!?

00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:59.812
IT ONLY NEEDS ONE OF US,

00:17:59.812 --> 00:18:02.481
SO I'M LETTING THE SEAL
TAKE ME INSTEAD!

00:18:02.481 --> 00:18:05.451
NOOOOO! YUGI!

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:14.093
ADIOS, YOUR HIGHNESS!

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:21.400
Joey: HEY!
YOU ALRIGHT PAL!?

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:22.635
I DOUBT IT.

00:18:22.635 --> 00:18:24.036
YEAH, DITTO.

00:18:24.036 --> 00:18:25.537
Duke:
THIS IS NUTS.

00:18:25.537 --> 00:18:27.873
Tristan:
COME ON, PAL.

00:18:27.873 --> 00:18:29.808
Joey:
YUGI! GET UP!

00:18:29.808 --> 00:18:31.744
PLEASE, YUGE!!

00:18:31.744 --> 00:18:36.081
Rafael: HA HA HA!

00:18:36.081 --> 00:18:38.984
YOU WON'T BE
NEEDING THESE
ANYMORE.

00:19:02.608 --> 00:19:04.643
Joey: EY YOU!
TAKE YA HANDS
OFF 'IM!

00:19:04.643 --> 00:19:05.878
FINE!

00:19:05.878 --> 00:19:08.247
Duke: ARE YOU GUYS
ALL RIGHT?!

00:19:08.247 --> 00:19:09.882
YOU CAN KEEP'M.

00:19:09.882 --> 00:19:12.985
I ALREADY HAVE EVERYTHING
OF HIS I NEED.

00:19:12.985 --> 00:19:15.754
HA HA HA HA!

00:19:15.754 --> 00:19:18.223
GET BACK HERE!
YA HEAR ME!?

00:19:18.223 --> 00:19:19.391
Tristan:
YUGI?

00:19:19.391 --> 00:19:20.626
Duke:
SPEAK TO US.

00:19:20.626 --> 00:19:22.561
HA! HEY, REX...

00:19:22.561 --> 00:19:25.631
I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING!

00:19:25.631 --> 00:19:26.899
Duke:
YOU GOTTA GET UP!

00:19:26.899 --> 00:19:28.701
CAN YA HEAR US,
YUGI?!

00:19:28.701 --> 00:19:34.473
COME ON!
WAKE UP!

00:19:34.473 --> 00:19:36.108
Tristan:
HE'S AWAKE!

00:19:36.108 --> 00:19:40.479
Joey: I KNEW
YOU'D OUTSMART
DAT BIG GOON!

00:19:40.479 --> 00:19:44.383
SO HOW'D YA
DO IT YUGE?
HOW'D YA ESCAPE?

00:19:44.383 --> 00:19:47.052
EVERYTHING
A'RIGHT PAL?

00:19:47.052 --> 00:19:48.754
Yami-Yugi:
NO, JOEY.

00:19:48.754 --> 00:19:51.724
IT'S FAR FROM ALRIGHT.

00:19:51.724 --> 00:19:55.594
I DIDN'T OUTSMART HIM.

00:19:55.594 --> 00:20:00.065
HE SUCCEEDED!
YUGI'S GONE!

00:20:10.809 --> 00:20:12.878
HA HA HA HA!

00:20:12.878 --> 00:20:17.149
GREAT LEVIATHAN, PLEASE ACCEPT
MY LATEST OFFERING.

00:20:26.558 --> 00:20:28.127
Joey:
I DON'T GET IT.

00:20:28.127 --> 00:20:30.929
HOW CAN YOU BE
TALKIN' TO US IF
HE TOOK YOUR SOUL?

00:20:30.929 --> 00:20:33.866
NOT MINE...YUGI'S!

00:20:33.866 --> 00:20:36.635
IT'S ALL MY FAULT!

00:20:36.635 --> 00:20:39.638
YUGI!! COME BACK!

00:20:39.638 --> 00:20:41.807
[SCREAMING]

00:20:41.807 --> 00:20:44.576
IT SHOULD HAVE
BEEN ME, NOT HIM.

00:20:44.576 --> 00:20:46.779
IT'S NOT FAIR!
