WEBVTT

00:00:00.476 --> 00:00:03.439
PREVIOUSLY ON "YU-GI-OH"...

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:05.674
DIVINE SERPENT, GO!

00:00:05.674 --> 00:00:08.143
STRIKE DOWN
ONE OF HIS KNIGHTS.

00:00:09.511 --> 00:00:12.281
YOU JUST LOST THE REST
OF YOUR LIFE POINTS,

00:00:12.281 --> 00:00:15.117
SO THE DUEL IS OVER.

00:00:15.117 --> 00:00:16.785
HOW DID YOU SURVIVE?

00:00:16.785 --> 00:00:18.187
WHEN MY LIFE POINTS
HIT ZERO,

00:00:18.187 --> 00:00:20.322
RELAY SOUL ALLOWED ME
TO STAY IN THE GAME

00:00:20.322 --> 00:00:22.324
BY SUMMONING
MY DARK MAGICIAN GIRL

00:00:22.324 --> 00:00:26.028
AND PUTTING MY FATE
IN HER HANDS.

00:00:26.028 --> 00:00:29.198
SO YOU AND I ARE IN
THE SAME SITUATION NOW.

00:00:29.198 --> 00:00:31.500
EACH OF US
HAS ONE MONSTER.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.535
YOU HAVE YOUR SERPENT,

00:00:33.535 --> 00:00:35.504
AND I HAVE
DARK MAGICIAN GIRL.

00:00:35.504 --> 00:00:39.341
WHEN ONE IS DESTROYED,
THE CARDHOLDER WILL LOSE.

00:00:39.341 --> 00:00:43.078
NOW, DIVINE SERPENT,
END THIS DUEL.

00:00:43.078 --> 00:00:46.482
Yami-Yugi, voice-over:
IF SHE'S DESTROYED,
ALL HOPE IS LOST.

00:01:55.284 --> 00:01:57.519
LEGENDARY KNIGHT HERMOS,

00:01:57.519 --> 00:02:00.823
ACTIVATE YOUR
SWORD OF RENEWAL.

00:02:00.823 --> 00:02:04.159
ABSORB THE POWER
OF A MONSTER
FROM MY GRAVEYARD.

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:09.498
I'LL PROTECT YOU,
MY PHARAOH!

00:02:13.535 --> 00:02:16.338
THANKS TO THE HELP
OF MY CELTIC GUARDIAN,

00:02:16.338 --> 00:02:18.173
HERMOS IS SAFE
FROM ANY MONSTER

00:02:18.173 --> 00:02:20.442
WITH 1,900 POINTS
OR MORE.

00:02:20.442 --> 00:02:21.844
WE'LL SEE.

00:02:21.844 --> 00:02:23.612
IN THE NAME
OF ATLANTIS...

00:02:23.612 --> 00:02:25.514
WE SHALL DEFEND...

00:02:25.514 --> 00:02:27.516
HE WHO HAS
RELEASED US.

00:02:27.516 --> 00:02:30.986
Yami-Yugi: YOUR SERPENT
HAS BEEN STOPPED.

00:02:30.986 --> 00:02:34.723
WELL, SO MUCH FOR
INFINITE STRENGTH.

00:02:34.723 --> 00:02:38.794
LESSON ONE,
ATTACK POINTS DON'T
MEAN EVERYTHING.

00:02:38.794 --> 00:02:40.362
YOU DODGE ONE BLAST,

00:02:40.362 --> 00:02:42.131
AND YOU THINK
YOU'RE KING OF THE WORLD?

00:02:42.131 --> 00:02:44.767
PLEASE.

00:02:44.767 --> 00:02:47.102
Yami-Yugi, voice-over:
ALL RIGHT, THIS IS
MY LAST CHANCE

00:02:47.102 --> 00:02:48.570
TO WIN THIS DUEL

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.040
AND FREE THE SOULS
OF MY FRIENDS
FROM CAPTIVITY.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.511
PLEASE,
HEART OF THE CARDS,
GUIDE ME.

00:02:55.511 --> 00:02:58.313
CRITIAS AND HERMOS,
PREPARE TO ATTACK.

00:02:58.313 --> 00:03:00.749
TAKE DOWN
HIS DIVINE SERPENT!

00:03:00.749 --> 00:03:02.317
RIGHT.

00:03:06.355 --> 00:03:08.323
FEEL MY SWORD
OF WISDOM!

00:03:12.194 --> 00:03:15.297
FEEL MY SWORD
OF RENEWAL.

00:03:15.297 --> 00:03:16.632
THEY'RE TOO WEAK.

00:03:16.632 --> 00:03:19.201
ARE YOU SURE?

00:03:19.201 --> 00:03:22.438
IF I WERE YOU,
I'D TAKE A CLOSER LOOK.

00:03:22.438 --> 00:03:23.672
WHAT'S THIS?

00:03:23.672 --> 00:03:25.507
YOUR KNIGHTS
SHOULD HAVE BEEN DESTROYED

00:03:25.507 --> 00:03:28.777
THE MOMENT THEY COLLIDED
WITH MY DIVINE SERPENT.

00:03:28.777 --> 00:03:30.012
WRONG.

00:03:30.012 --> 00:03:32.681
HAS YOUR MEMORY FADED
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS?

00:03:32.681 --> 00:03:34.116
EACH ONE
OF THESE KNIGHTS

00:03:34.116 --> 00:03:36.018
HAS A HIDDEN POWER.

00:03:36.018 --> 00:03:38.687
NOW, CRITIAS,
ABSORB THE ABILITY

00:03:38.687 --> 00:03:42.257
OF MY ATTACK
GUIDANCE BARRIER.

00:03:42.257 --> 00:03:44.526
THIS ALLOWS
CRITIAS TO
TRANSFER HIS ATTACK

00:03:44.526 --> 00:03:46.929
TO ANY OTHER
MONSTER ON THE FIELD.

00:03:46.929 --> 00:03:49.198
SO THE NEW
TARGET OF
HIS SWORD OF WISDOM

00:03:49.198 --> 00:03:51.967
WILL BE
LEGENDARY KNIGHT HERMOS.

00:03:51.967 --> 00:03:53.001
WHAT?

00:03:53.001 --> 00:03:54.603
IT'S TIME FOR HERMOS
TO ACTIVATE

00:03:54.603 --> 00:03:57.005
HIS SPECIAL ABILITY NOW.

00:03:57.005 --> 00:03:58.574
BUT FIRST
I MUST SACRIFICE

00:03:58.574 --> 00:04:00.976
MY 3 MAGNET WARRIORS.

00:04:00.976 --> 00:04:04.413
THIS ALLOWS HERMOS
TO TRIPLE THE STRENGTH
OF CRITIAS' ATTACK...

00:04:05.948 --> 00:04:08.617
AND SEND THAT ATTACK
RIGHT BACK.

00:04:08.617 --> 00:04:09.985
YOU CAN'T.

00:04:09.985 --> 00:04:12.187
I JUST DID!

00:04:12.187 --> 00:04:13.856
NOW MY TWO KNIGHTS
ARE REFLECTING

00:04:13.856 --> 00:04:15.357
THEIR ATTACK
BACK AND FORTH

00:04:15.357 --> 00:04:18.994
AS ITS STRENGTH
INCREASES TO INFINITY.

00:04:18.994 --> 00:04:20.195
SO?

00:04:20.195 --> 00:04:22.798
THAT ATTACK IS STUCK
IN AN ENDLESS LOOP.

00:04:22.798 --> 00:04:24.466
HOLD ON, DARTZ.

00:04:24.466 --> 00:04:25.868
I'M NOT DONE, YET.

00:04:25.868 --> 00:04:28.303
I STILL HAVE
ONE KNIGHT LEFT.

00:04:30.339 --> 00:04:34.810
TIMAEUS, MERGE TOGETHER
WITH HERMOS AND CRITIAS!

00:04:37.246 --> 00:04:40.315
YOUR DIVINE
SERPENT'S STRENGTH
MAY BE INFINITE,

00:04:40.315 --> 00:04:42.184
BUT THAT'S STILL
NOT ENOUGH,

00:04:42.184 --> 00:04:46.121
FOR NOW THERE'S A FORCE
BEYOND INFINITY--

00:04:46.121 --> 00:04:48.824
MY KNIGHT OF DESTINY!

00:04:48.824 --> 00:04:51.627
A POWER GREATER
THAN MY DIVINE SERPENT?

00:04:51.627 --> 00:04:52.961
IMPOSSIBLE.

00:04:52.961 --> 00:04:54.429
SEE FOR YOURSELF.

00:04:54.429 --> 00:04:55.931
KNIGHT OF DESTINY,

00:04:55.931 --> 00:04:59.001
ATTACK HIS
REPTILE WITH
SWORD OF JUSTICE.

00:05:09.611 --> 00:05:12.848
NO!

00:05:12.848 --> 00:05:15.517
Joey: LOOK, IT'S
SOME KIND OF OPENING.

00:05:15.517 --> 00:05:18.153
THAT COULD BE
A WAY OUT, GUYS.

00:05:18.153 --> 00:05:19.855
Yami-Yugi:
YOU LOSE, DARTZ.

00:05:19.855 --> 00:05:23.458
YOUR 10,000-YEAR QUEST
IS FINALLY OVER.

00:05:23.458 --> 00:05:25.127
IT CAN'T BE.

00:05:25.127 --> 00:05:27.362
I'VE COME TOO CLOSE.

00:05:27.362 --> 00:05:29.831
ALL I NEED IS
ONE MORE POWERFUL SOUL.

00:05:29.831 --> 00:05:31.833
AND THE GREAT LEVIATHAN
WILL ARISE

00:05:31.833 --> 00:05:33.802
FROM THE DEPTHS
OF THE EARTH.

00:05:37.105 --> 00:05:39.007
TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE.

00:05:39.007 --> 00:05:43.178
YOUR SERPENT
HAS BEEN DESTROYED,

00:05:43.178 --> 00:05:47.149
AND WITH THAT, OUR DUEL
COMES TO AN END.

00:05:50.686 --> 00:05:53.021
NOW RELEASE THE SOULS
OF MY FRIENDS

00:05:53.021 --> 00:05:55.257
AND EVERYONE ELSE
YOU'VE HELD CAPTIVE.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.796
Fugata:
I HOPE MR. KAIBA'S
ALL RIGHT IN THERE.

00:06:11.796 --> 00:06:13.864
[RUMBLING]

00:06:13.864 --> 00:06:16.334
AND I HOPE WE'RE
ALL RIGHT OUT HERE.

00:06:17.535 --> 00:06:19.337
Fugata:
NOW WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:06:21.305 --> 00:06:22.840
IT'S A CYCLONE!

00:06:35.286 --> 00:06:39.290
Man, on radio:
THIS IS CENTRAL COMMAND
TO U.S.S. COURAGE.

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:42.193
WE'VE RECEIVED REPORTS
THAT A MASSIVE STORM
OF UNKNOWN ORIGINS

00:06:42.193 --> 00:06:44.862
IS SPREADING ACROSS
THE GLOBE.

00:06:44.862 --> 00:06:48.432
UPGRADE ALL UNITS TO YELLOW
ALERT STATUS IMMEDIATELY,

00:06:48.432 --> 00:06:52.269
AND MAINTAIN
YOUR CURRENT COORDINATES
UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.641
Timaeus: CHOSEN DUELISTS,

00:06:57.641 --> 00:07:01.812
BY THE POWER OF ATLANTIS,
WE RELEASE THEE.

00:07:01.812 --> 00:07:03.647
HEY!

00:07:03.647 --> 00:07:04.982
AAH!

00:07:04.982 --> 00:07:06.851
WHOA!

00:07:06.851 --> 00:07:09.854
THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE
IN HERE, TOO, YOU KNOW.

00:07:12.723 --> 00:07:14.859
Timaeus: NOW, DUELISTS
OF THE PROPHECY,

00:07:14.859 --> 00:07:16.794
BY ORDER OF
THE KNIGHTS OF ATLANTIS,

00:07:16.794 --> 00:07:18.829
CROSS INTO THE HUMAN WORLD.

00:07:24.969 --> 00:07:26.270
YUGI.

00:07:48.292 --> 00:07:50.094
MOKUBA, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

00:07:50.094 --> 00:07:52.096
COME ON, WAKE UP.

00:07:53.731 --> 00:07:56.267
SETO, YOU'RE HERE.

00:07:58.069 --> 00:07:59.070
OH, GREAT.

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:01.806
YOU'RE BACK.

00:08:01.806 --> 00:08:03.174
OH, MAN.

00:08:03.174 --> 00:08:05.142
DID DARTZ
GET YOU, TOO?

00:08:05.142 --> 00:08:06.644
COME ON, WAKE UP.

00:08:06.644 --> 00:08:08.312
Tea: HUH?

00:08:08.312 --> 00:08:11.649
WHA--WHA--

00:08:11.649 --> 00:08:12.850
WHERE ARE WE?

00:08:14.485 --> 00:08:16.020
IS THAT YUGI?

00:08:18.489 --> 00:08:20.324
NAH, IT'S THE PHARAOH.

00:08:20.324 --> 00:08:21.459
NO, TRISTAN.

00:08:21.459 --> 00:08:24.028
I THINK YUGI'S BACK.

00:08:24.028 --> 00:08:26.030
Mokuba: HE DOES KIND
OF LOOK SHORTER.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:30.768
IT IS YOU.

00:08:30.768 --> 00:08:31.969
YUGI!

00:08:31.969 --> 00:08:33.003
TEA?

00:08:34.538 --> 00:08:36.540
I THOUGHT WE'D NEVER
SEE YOU AGAIN.

00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:38.509
IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU, TOO.

00:08:38.509 --> 00:08:40.144
Joey: ALL RIGHT,
OUT OF MY WAY, PEOPLE.

00:08:40.144 --> 00:08:43.781
WHERE'S MY LITTLE BUDDY?

00:08:43.781 --> 00:08:44.782
HA HA! YUGE!

00:08:44.782 --> 00:08:47.618
MAN, DID I MISS
THIS SPIKY LITTLE HEAD.

00:08:47.618 --> 00:08:48.652
HEY, JOEY.

00:08:48.652 --> 00:08:50.054
THE GANG IS BACK!

00:08:50.054 --> 00:08:52.022
Tristan:
DON'T FORGET ABOUT ME!

00:08:53.491 --> 00:08:57.461
YUGI, THE LEGENDARY KNIGHTS
HAVE SET YOU FREE.

00:08:57.461 --> 00:08:59.130
DOES THAT MEAN
YOU BEAT DARTZ?

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:01.198
YES. BUT AS SOON
AS OUR DUEL ENDED,

00:09:01.198 --> 00:09:02.867
HE DISAPPEARED
INTO SOME VORTEX,

00:09:02.867 --> 00:09:05.703
AND I HAVE A BAD FEELING
THE WORST IS YET TO COME,

00:09:05.703 --> 00:09:08.172
BUT AT LEAST
WE'LL FACE IT TOGETHER.

00:09:10.374 --> 00:09:12.543
I GUESS IF YOU GUYS
WERE SET FREE,

00:09:12.543 --> 00:09:15.045
SO WAS EVERYONE ELSE
DARTZ CAPTURED.

00:09:15.045 --> 00:09:17.848
GUESS AGAIN,
MOKUBA.

00:09:17.848 --> 00:09:20.951
NOT EVERYONE
WAS SO LUCKY.

00:09:20.951 --> 00:09:23.220
Joey: ALL
THE OTHER POOR SCHLUBS
ARE STILL TRAPPED.

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:26.190
MR. KAIBA,
COME OUTSIDE!

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:34.965
LOOK!
OH, GREAT.

00:09:34.965 --> 00:09:36.267
WHAT IS THAT?

00:09:36.267 --> 00:09:38.302
Joey:
WHATEVER IT IS,
IT'S HUGE.

00:09:38.302 --> 00:09:39.803
Tea: DON'T TELL ME.

00:09:39.803 --> 00:09:40.804
Tristan: WHAT?

00:09:40.804 --> 00:09:42.573
IT'S ATLANTIS!

00:09:59.456 --> 00:10:01.792
Tristan:
YOU SURE THAT THING
IS ATLANTIS?

00:10:01.792 --> 00:10:03.427
Joey: HMM.

00:10:03.427 --> 00:10:05.696
BIG ANCIENT CITY
LOOKING THING RISING UP
OUT OF THE OCEAN?

00:10:05.696 --> 00:10:07.198
I'D SAY THAT
FITS THE BILL.

00:10:07.198 --> 00:10:09.466
I GUESS THIS MEANS DARTZ
IS STILL OUT THERE

00:10:09.466 --> 00:10:11.368
AND HE'S NOT GONNA GIVE UP.

00:10:11.368 --> 00:10:13.604
LET'S JUST HOPE
HE'S ALONE, GUYS.

00:10:13.604 --> 00:10:17.541
YA MEAN HE COULD
HAVE WOKEN UP THAT
LEVIATHAN THING?

00:10:17.541 --> 00:10:20.377
IS THAT THE GIANT MONSTER
HE KEPT TALKING ABOUT?

00:10:20.377 --> 00:10:21.879
YUP. AND
LET ME TELL YA,

00:10:21.879 --> 00:10:24.048
FROM WHAT I SAW,
IT AIN'T PRETTY.

00:10:27.618 --> 00:10:29.520
Man: WELL,
HOW'S IT LOOK
OUT THERE?

00:10:30.955 --> 00:10:33.557
NOT GOOD.

00:10:33.557 --> 00:10:35.192
A STRANGE UNDERWATER
DISTURBANCE

00:10:35.192 --> 00:10:37.528
HAS TRIGGERED
A GIANT HURRICANE.

00:10:37.528 --> 00:10:39.763
IT'S OVER 6,000 MILES
IN DIAMETER

00:10:39.763 --> 00:10:43.467
AND HEADING TOWARDS
THE ATLANTIC COASTLINE
AS WE SPEAK.

00:10:43.467 --> 00:10:45.536
WHEN WILL IT REACH LAND?

00:10:45.536 --> 00:10:47.304
APPROXIMATELY
ONE HOUR.

00:10:47.304 --> 00:10:49.840
IN ONE HOUR?

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:51.375
Kaiba: I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE DEAL IS,

00:10:51.375 --> 00:10:53.210
BUT I'M GOING UP THERE
TO FIND OUT.

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:54.311
Tristan: GREAT.

00:10:54.311 --> 00:10:56.146
TELL US ALL ABOUT IT
WHEN YOU GET BACK.

00:10:56.146 --> 00:10:59.149
HOLD ON, GUYS,
I'M GOING, TOO.

00:10:59.149 --> 00:11:00.384
Tea: YOU'RE
WHAT?

00:11:00.384 --> 00:11:02.219
NOT WITHOUT ME
YOU'RE NOT.

00:11:02.219 --> 00:11:03.787
ARE YOU
THREE NUTS?

00:11:03.787 --> 00:11:05.789
YOU JUST GOT BACK

00:11:05.789 --> 00:11:08.525
AND YOU'RE GONNA
WALK INTO DARTZ'S
HANDS AGAIN?

00:11:08.525 --> 00:11:10.427
YOU'VE DONE
EVERYTHING YOU CAN,

00:11:10.427 --> 00:11:12.763
SO JUST WALK AWAY
WHILE YOU STILL
HAVE THE CHANCE.

00:11:12.763 --> 00:11:14.932
LOOK, I KNOW IT'S HARD
TO SEE US GO,

00:11:14.932 --> 00:11:17.034
BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE
STILL TRAPPED
ON THE OTHER SIDE,

00:11:17.034 --> 00:11:19.136
AND THEY'RE COUNTING
ON US, TEA.

00:11:19.136 --> 00:11:20.471
YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:11:20.471 --> 00:11:22.039
WE'LL BE BACK SOON.

00:11:22.039 --> 00:11:24.642
Roland: MR. KAIBA,
MORE BAD NEWS.

00:11:24.642 --> 00:11:26.043
WHAT NOW?

00:11:26.043 --> 00:11:29.013
THERE'S A MASSIVE HURRICANE
HEADING FOR THE EAST COAST,

00:11:29.013 --> 00:11:30.981
AND IT'LL BE THERE
IN LESS THAN ONE HOUR.

00:11:30.981 --> 00:11:32.349
HURRICANE?

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.222
Kaiba: I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT YOU DWEEBS,

00:11:38.222 --> 00:11:41.758
BUT I'M GOING UP THERE
TO FIND DARTZ.

00:11:41.758 --> 00:11:42.859
SETO, HOLD ON!

00:11:42.859 --> 00:11:44.294
YEAH,
WAIT FOR US.

00:11:44.294 --> 00:11:46.829
DON'T DO ME
ANY FAVORS, YUGI.

00:11:46.829 --> 00:11:50.700
I'M PERFECTLY CAPABLE
OF HANDLING THIS
ON MY OWN.

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:53.903
HEY, DON'T THINK
YOU'RE GETTING

00:11:53.903 --> 00:11:55.071
ALL THE CREDIT
FOR THIS.

00:11:55.071 --> 00:11:57.440
DON'T YOU HAVE
SOMEONE ELSE TO ANNOY?

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.075
NOPE. NOT AT
THE MOMENT.

00:12:01.778 --> 00:12:03.479
WAIT, YUGI!

00:12:03.479 --> 00:12:04.781
WHAT'S UP?

00:12:04.781 --> 00:12:06.683
WAIT. I KNOW.

00:12:06.683 --> 00:12:08.851
YOU WANT TO WISH
THE PHARAOH LUCK, RIGHT?

00:12:08.851 --> 00:12:12.655
UM, ACTUALLY I WANTED
TO WISH YOU LUCK.

00:12:12.655 --> 00:12:14.190
OH.

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:17.660
AND, YUGI, YOU PROMISED
YOU'D COME BACK SOON.

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:20.596
NOW GO AND KICK SOME
DARTZ BUTT, WILL YA?

00:12:20.596 --> 00:12:21.965
SURE THING.

00:12:23.499 --> 00:12:26.069
WE'LL BE BACK
BEFORE YA KNOW IT.

00:12:26.069 --> 00:12:29.005
AND REMEMBER,
WE'RE HERE
IF YOU NEED US.

00:12:29.005 --> 00:12:30.340
Yugi:
THANKS, TRISTAN.

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:32.642
Tea: STOP RIGHT
THERE, MOKUBA.

00:12:32.642 --> 00:12:35.645
YOUR BROTHER'S
GONNA BE FINE,
TRUST ME.

00:12:41.784 --> 00:12:43.519
THAT'S WEIRD.

00:12:43.519 --> 00:12:45.922
MY PUZZLE IS
REACTING TO SOMETHING.

00:12:49.692 --> 00:12:51.427
WHOA! NO WAY!

00:12:51.427 --> 00:12:56.099
IT'S ALL 3 OF MY
EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS.

00:12:56.099 --> 00:12:59.602
FINALLY, THEY'RE BACK
WHERE THEY BELONG.

00:12:59.602 --> 00:13:02.038
YES, BUT THEY'RE
POWERLESS NOW.

00:13:02.038 --> 00:13:06.843
DARTZ MUST HAVE
TRANSFERRED THEIR ENERGY
TO HIS GREAT LEVIATHAN.

00:13:06.843 --> 00:13:08.845
WELL, HOPEFULLY WHEN
THIS IS ALL OVER,

00:13:08.845 --> 00:13:10.847
THEY'LL BE BACK TO
THEIR OLD SELVES.

00:13:10.847 --> 00:13:13.316
YES, BUT WE'VE
A LONG WAY TO GO.

00:13:15.952 --> 00:13:17.587
Joey: IS IT ME,

00:13:17.587 --> 00:13:20.323
OR WAS THIS ROOM
WALLPAPERED WITH SOULS
A FEW MINUTES AGO?

00:13:20.323 --> 00:13:23.326
THAT LEVIATHAN MUST HAVE
BEAMED 'EM ALL UP.

00:13:23.326 --> 00:13:26.496
HEY, GUYS,
YOU'LL NEED THESE.

00:13:26.496 --> 00:13:27.563
Joey: HERMOS.

00:13:27.563 --> 00:13:29.198
Kaiba: CRITIAS.

00:13:29.198 --> 00:13:32.335
OH, YEAH, WE'RE BACK
IN BUSINESS, BABY.

00:13:32.335 --> 00:13:35.104
ALL WE HAVE TO DO NOW
IS FIND THAT SNAKE.

00:13:35.104 --> 00:13:36.773
HE COULDN'T HAVE GONE FAR.

00:13:36.773 --> 00:13:38.274
Dartz: RIGHT YOU ARE.

00:13:38.274 --> 00:13:40.443
[LAUGHS]

00:13:40.443 --> 00:13:42.111
COME IN, GENTLEMEN.

00:13:42.111 --> 00:13:43.913
THE PARTY'S JUST BEGUN.

00:13:43.913 --> 00:13:45.615
IT'S HIM!

00:13:45.615 --> 00:13:47.116
ARE WE GOING
OR WHAT?

00:13:47.116 --> 00:13:48.918
WHAT DO YOU THINK,
GENIUS?

00:13:48.918 --> 00:13:51.220
Joey: I'M DETECTING
SOME SARCASM, RICH BOY.

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:52.522
Kaiba: REALLY?

00:14:09.605 --> 00:14:11.340
WE'RE HERE.

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:14.277
BOY, THIS ATLANTIS PLACE
IS A REAL DUMP, HUH?

00:14:14.277 --> 00:14:16.779
ANY IDEA WHERE DARTZ IS?

00:14:16.779 --> 00:14:19.282
I HAVE A HUNCH.

00:14:19.282 --> 00:14:21.250
UH, YEAH.

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:24.020
I GUESS GIANT
GREEN BEAM OF LIGHT
MARKS THE SPOT.

00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:27.757
WELL, THIS IS IT.

00:14:27.757 --> 00:14:30.460
YU-GI-OH!

00:14:31.727 --> 00:14:33.296
LET'S GO.

00:14:41.003 --> 00:14:42.472
Yami-Yugi:
HE MUST BE OVER THERE.

00:14:44.674 --> 00:14:46.209
HEY, I THINK
I SEE HIM,

00:14:46.209 --> 00:14:47.276
JUST SITTIN' THERE

00:14:47.276 --> 00:14:48.277
WAITIN' TO GET
CRUSHED

00:14:48.277 --> 00:14:49.745
BY THE AWESOME
THREESOME.

00:14:58.888 --> 00:15:00.256
HOLD ON.

00:15:02.058 --> 00:15:04.994
Joey: AND I
THOUGHT THIS GUY
WAS CREEPY BEFORE.

00:15:11.501 --> 00:15:12.969
CAREFUL, YUGE.

00:15:15.571 --> 00:15:18.841
ALL RIGHT, DOES
SOMEONE WANT TO
FILL ME IN HERE?

00:15:18.841 --> 00:15:21.944
DARTZ MUST HAVE SOMEHOW
LEFT HIS BODY BEHIND.

00:15:21.944 --> 00:15:23.279
BUT HOW?

00:15:23.279 --> 00:15:24.514
PLEASE.

00:15:24.514 --> 00:15:26.182
IT'S JUST ANOTHER ONE
OF HIS CHEAP TRICKS.

00:15:26.182 --> 00:15:28.518
Dartz: IS THAT YOUR ANSWER
TO EVERYTHING, KAIBA?

00:15:28.518 --> 00:15:31.287
YOU REALLY NEED
A NEW CATCH PHRASE.

00:15:31.287 --> 00:15:33.689
WHERE ARE YOU?

00:15:33.689 --> 00:15:36.292
I'M RIGHT HERE
WITH THE GREAT LEVIATHAN.

00:15:36.292 --> 00:15:37.860
HOLD ON, DARTZ!

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:40.062
YOU TOLD US
YOUR LEVIATHAN
COULDN'T AWAKEN

00:15:40.062 --> 00:15:42.798
WITHOUT THE SOULS
OF THE 3 CHOSEN
DUELISTS.

00:15:42.798 --> 00:15:45.234
YES, I DID SAY THAT,
DIDN'T I?

00:15:45.234 --> 00:15:48.638
WELL, I SUBSTITUTED
YOUR SOULS WITH
AN EQUALLY POWERFUL ONE.

00:15:48.638 --> 00:15:50.373
YOUR SOUL.

00:15:50.373 --> 00:15:51.741
BINGO.

00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:59.081
WHAT'S THAT?

00:16:06.422 --> 00:16:08.791
Dartz:
FUELED BY THE POWER
OF MY SPIRIT,

00:16:08.791 --> 00:16:11.260
THE GREAT BEAST
HAS RETURNED.

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:12.828
THIS IS NUTS!

00:16:19.953 --> 00:16:21.488
Joey: THAT THING COULD
PICK ITS TEETH

00:16:21.488 --> 00:16:23.657
WITH AN EGYPTIAN
GOD MONSTER.

00:16:23.657 --> 00:16:25.993
AND IT'S HERE
TO CONQUER MANKIND.

00:16:25.993 --> 00:16:27.427
HOLD ON.
WHAT'S THAT?

00:16:27.427 --> 00:16:28.495
Kaiba: WHAT?

00:16:28.495 --> 00:16:30.631
THAT LITTLE GREEN
PIMPLE ON ITS NOSE.

00:16:32.933 --> 00:16:35.002
WAIT. IT'S DARTZ.

00:16:35.002 --> 00:16:37.170
YES, WHEN HE LOST
OUR DUEL,

00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:38.572
HE MUST HAVE SOMEHOW
MERGED TOGETHER

00:16:38.572 --> 00:16:40.774
WITH THE GREAT
LEVIATHAN.

00:16:40.774 --> 00:16:42.442
Dartz:
YES, IT'S TRUE.

00:16:42.442 --> 00:16:44.545
NOTHING GETS PAST
YOU, PHARAOH.

00:16:44.545 --> 00:16:46.480
THAT'S IT!

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:49.917
I'M NOT GONNA STAND HERE
AND TALK TO SOME
MUTATED HOOD ORNAMENT.

00:16:49.917 --> 00:16:52.653
I'M JUST GONNA BLAST YOU
INTO NEXT WEEK.

[DARTZ LAUGHS]

00:16:54.087 --> 00:16:56.390
Dartz: I'D LOVE
TO SEE YOU TRY.

00:16:59.826 --> 00:17:04.164
ALL RIGHT, BRING IT ON
YOU OVERSIZED
SNAKE IN THE GRASS.

00:17:04.164 --> 00:17:06.667
LET'S DO THIS.

00:17:06.667 --> 00:17:09.503
I SUMMON
MY DARK MAGICIAN,

00:17:09.503 --> 00:17:13.507
MY SUMMONED SKULL,
AND MY KURIBOH.

00:17:13.507 --> 00:17:16.643
I'M KICKIN' IT WITH
MY FLAME SWORDSMAN,

MY JINZO, AND GOOD
OL' RED-EYES.

00:17:20.314 --> 00:17:21.648

00:17:21.648 --> 00:17:25.052
GO, BLUE-EYES
ULTIMATE DRAGON.

00:17:25.052 --> 00:17:28.922
THEN I'LL ADD
GADGET SOLDIER,
AND VORSE RAIDER.

00:17:28.922 --> 00:17:30.157
NOW, TIMAEUS...

THE FANG OF CRITIAS...

YOUR TRUE FORM!

KNIGHTS OF ATLANTIS.

YOU'RE KIDDING
ME, YUGE.

00:18:01.788 --> 00:18:03.323
THEY'RE REALLY KNIGHTS?

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:09.563
NOW, MONSTERS, ATTACK!

SO WHEN DO YOU PLAN
ON LAUNCHING

00:18:40.427 --> 00:18:42.362
YOUR REAL ATTACK,
GENTLEMEN?

WHAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH?

NO WAY!

ALL THOSE ATTACKS
AND NOT ONE SCRATCH?

00:19:21.768 --> 00:19:23.837
THAT MAKES NO SENSE.

IT GETS WORSE.

00:19:40.654 --> 00:19:42.155
AND IF THAT ATTACK
HITS US,

00:19:42.155 --> 00:19:44.124
WE'RE GONNA BE
FRIED TO A CRISP.

00:19:48.295 --> 00:19:50.497
GO, LEGENDARY
KNIGHT TIMAEUS!

00:19:50.497 --> 00:19:53.500
ABSORB THE POWER
OF MY BIG SHIELD GARDNA

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:56.470
AND ACTIVATE
FULL BARRIER SHIELD!

00:20:10.484 --> 00:20:13.153
LEVIATHAN
IS TOO STRONG!

00:20:13.153 --> 00:20:16.490
OUR MONSTERS,
THEY'RE ALL GONE.

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:18.258
WE STILL HAVE
OUR 3 KNIGHTS...

00:20:18.258 --> 00:20:19.860
FOR NOW,

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:23.330
BUT OL' LEVIATHAN'S GEARIN'
UP FOR ANOTHER ATTACK,

00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:25.799
AND THIS TIME
WE MAY NOT BE SO LUCKY.

00:20:28.668 --> 00:20:30.637
BRACE
YOURSELVES.

00:20:32.939 --> 00:20:34.941
I RECOGNIZE THOSE LIGHTS.

00:20:34.941 --> 00:20:36.076
ME, TOO.

00:20:36.076 --> 00:20:37.544
ME THREE.

00:20:40.413 --> 00:20:42.282
IT'S JUST LIKE
THAT NIGHT

00:20:42.282 --> 00:20:44.384
WHEN THE GATEWAY
FIRST OPENED.
