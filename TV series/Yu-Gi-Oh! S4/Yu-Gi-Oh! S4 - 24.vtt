00:10:17.776 --> 00:10:20.482
WE HAFTA FIND HIM.

00:10:20.482 --> 00:10:21.484
IF YOU DON'T
GET HIM BACK,

00:10:21.484 --> 00:10:22.986
I'LL NEVER
FORGIVE YOU!

00:10:22.986 --> 00:10:25.357
PLUS WE NEED HIM
TO FIGHT THESE GUYS!

00:10:25.357 --> 00:10:26.760
I MISS HIM, TOO.

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:28.831
AND I PROMISE
I WILL RESCUE HIM.

00:10:28.831 --> 00:10:31.937
YOU HAVE MY WORD.

00:10:31.937 --> 00:10:35.210
BUT I NEED TO PAY

00:10:37.047 --> 00:10:38.984
YOU'LL NEED
SOME TECH SUPPORT.

00:10:38.984 --> 00:10:42.457
THIS ISN'T SOME KIND
OF FIELD TRIP, KID.

00:10:42.457 --> 00:10:44.628
BUT I GUESS YOU CAN
TAG ALONG IF YOU WANT.

00:10:44.628 --> 00:10:45.864
I'M NO KID!

00:10:45.864 --> 00:10:49.070
WHATEVER YOU SAY, KID.

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:50.839
I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT YOU GEEKS.

00:10:50.839 --> 00:10:52.810
BUT I HAVE
A COMPANY TO SAVE.

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:55.214
SO WHOEVER'S COMING WITH ME,
LET'S MOVE.

00:10:55.214 --> 00:10:57.887
OKAY!

00:10:57.887 --> 00:10:59.957
GOOD LUCK.
N'BE CAREFUL.

00:10:59.957 --> 00:11:02.395
RIGHT.

00:11:02.395 --> 00:11:03.764
ALRIGHT, TEA.

00:11:03.764 --> 00:11:06.102
WE BETTER TELL THE POLICE
WHAT'S GOING ON.

00:11:06.102 --> 00:11:08.874
THE WAY THIS IS HEADING
WE'RE GONNA NEED ALL
THE HELP WE CAN GET.

00:11:08.874 --> 00:11:10.410
YEAH, GOOD POINT.

00:11:12.147 --> 00:11:15.820
Kaiba: C'MON!
TRY TO KEEP UP!

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:17.190
WHERE ARE WE GOING,
KAIBA?

00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:18.826
WE'RE TAKING
A SHORT CUT.

00:11:18.826 --> 00:11:21.164
IT'S AN UNDERGROUND PASSAGE
TO MY CENTRAL COMPUTER

00:11:21.164 --> 00:11:23.168
DESIGNED FOR EMERGENCIES.

00:11:27.143 --> 00:11:29.180
Computer: ACCESS GRANTED.

00:11:30.649 --> 00:11:33.020
NOW IF DARTZ'S
BRUTE-SQUAD IS
GUARDING THE AREA

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:35.658
THEY'LL NEVER SEE US
GO INSIDE.

00:11:37.295 --> 00:11:39.232
[THINKING]
NO ONE MESSES
WITH MY COMPANY

00:11:39.232 --> 00:11:41.937
AND GETS AWAY
WITH IT.

00:11:46.412 --> 00:11:47.882
[GROWLS]

00:11:51.255 --> 00:11:52.591

00:11:57.233 --> 00:12:00.974
I DUNNO WHAT THAT WAS
AND I'M NOT STAYING
TO FIND OUT!

00:12:02.176 --> 00:12:03.779
LET'S GO!

00:12:06.351 --> 00:12:08.388
[GROWLING]

00:12:11.027 --> 00:12:13.398

THESE MONSTERS

00:12:13.398 --> 00:12:15.201
AREN'T HOLOGRAMS
DON'T YOU?

00:12:15.201 --> 00:12:18.374
IF YOU'RE SUGGESTING
THAT WE'RE SURROUNDED
BY REAL MONSTERS

00:12:18.374 --> 00:12:19.877
YOU'RE AS INSANE
AS THE LUNATICS

00:12:19.877 --> 00:12:21.781
WHO TOOK OVER KAIBA CORP!

00:12:21.781 --> 00:12:24.018
THESE THINGS CAN'T BE REAL!

00:12:24.018 --> 00:12:26.156
THEY ARE.
BELIEVE ME.

00:12:26.156 --> 00:12:28.694
SOMEHOW A DOORWAY
HAS BEEN OPENED UP.

00:12:28.694 --> 00:12:30.564
AND MONSTERS FROM
A PARALLEL UNIVERSE

00:12:30.564 --> 00:12:32.735
HAVE ENTERED
INTO OUR WORLD!

00:12:32.735 --> 00:12:35.173
UNLESS YOU'VE GOT
A BETTER EXPLANATION.

00:12:35.173 --> 00:12:37.010
I THINK YOU'RE NUTS

00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:39.481
BUT THIS ISN'T
THE BEST TIME TO ARGUE.

00:12:39.481 --> 00:12:42.287
LET'S GO, KAIBA!
WE'VE NOTHING TO LOSE!

DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?!

00:12:54.581 --> 00:12:56.084
THAT IS THE TRUTH!

00:12:56.084 --> 00:12:57.888
THERE'S A MOTORCYCLE GANG
GOING AROUND

00:12:57.888 --> 00:13:00.659
STEALING PEOPLE'S SOULS
WITH A MAGIC CARD!

00:13:00.659 --> 00:13:03.698
YOU KIDS WATCH
TOO MANY CARTOONS!

00:13:03.698 --> 00:13:05.268
WE'RE SERIOUS!

00:13:05.268 --> 00:13:07.706
THESE GUYS ARE
TRYING TO TAKE OVER
THE WHOLE WORLD!

00:13:07.706 --> 00:13:08.975
