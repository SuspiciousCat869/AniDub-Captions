HE'S RIGHT.

I'M AFRAID
THERE'S MORE.

00:10:33.376 --> 00:10:36.081
NEXT, I'LL COMBINE IT
TOGETHER WITH MY RED-EYES!

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:45.800
TOGETHER MY TWO MONSTERS
FORM THE ULTIMATE WEAPON:

AND WHO BETTER TO USE IT
THAN MY SWORDMASTER!

00:10:52.278 --> 00:10:55.350
PLUS, HE GETS AN EXTRA
500 ATTACK POINTS

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:57.488
FOR EVERY DRAGON
MONSTER ON THE FIELD!

00:10:57.488 --> 00:10:58.557
NO!

MAKES YOUR MONSTER
EVEN STRONGER!

00:11:02.163 --> 00:11:05.903
PLUS THE SWORD
GIVES HIM 1,000
MORE ATTACK POINTS!
