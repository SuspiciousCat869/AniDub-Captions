THAN A FEW PARTY TRICKS
TO SCARE ME.

00:10:28.494 --> 00:10:32.598
NOW, FOR THE LAST TIME,
RELEASE OUR FRIENDS.

00:10:32.598 --> 00:10:34.433
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

00:10:34.433 --> 00:10:35.935
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:10:35.935 --> 00:10:38.704
I MEAN THEY'VE ALREADY
BEEN PUT TO USE.

00:10:38.704 --> 00:10:42.041
AS WE SPEAK,
THEIR LIFE ENERGY
SUPPLIES POWER

00:10:42.041 --> 00:10:44.744
TO THE MOST
DEVASTATING CREATURE
THAT EVER LIVED.

00:10:44.744 --> 00:10:45.911
OH, GREAT.

00:10:45.911 --> 00:10:47.380
NOW WHAT?

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:50.950
MY 10,000-YEAR-OLD
COLLECTION
IS ALMOST COMPLETE.

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:53.853
ONCE I GET YOU TWO,
THE BEAST CAN RISE.

00:10:53.853 --> 00:10:55.321
HOLD ON!

00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:57.823
YOU'VE BEEN
COLLECTING SOULS
FOR ALL THOSE YEARS?

00:10:57.823 --> 00:11:00.359
DO YOU KNOW
HOW MANY LIVES
YOU'VE DESTROYED?

00:11:00.359 --> 00:11:01.894
[CHUCKLES]

00:11:01.894 --> 00:11:03.295
MILLIONS!

00:11:03.295 --> 00:11:06.399
AND EACH ONE OF THEM
DESERVED THEIR FATE.

00:11:06.399 --> 00:11:09.602
TAKE A MOMENT
AND LOOK AROUND,
WON'T YOU?

00:11:12.638 --> 00:11:17.643
SOME OF MY FAVORITE CONQUESTS
ARE IN THIS VERY ROOM.

00:11:17.643 --> 00:11:21.447
AND SINCE IT'S TAKEN ME
10 MILLENNIA TO COMPLETE,

00:11:21.447 --> 00:11:24.417
IT'S QUITE
THE HISTORY LESSON.

00:11:24.417 --> 00:11:25.451
HE'S RIGHT.

00:11:25.451 --> 00:11:27.553
LOOK AT THE OUTFITS
ON THESE GUYS.

00:11:27.553 --> 00:11:29.755
SO SOME OF THESE
PEOPLE LIVED IN
THE PAST?

00:11:29.755 --> 00:11:31.891
NOW YOU'RE CATCHING ON.

00:11:31.891 --> 00:11:34.727
EVER SINCE
THE GREAT LEVIATHAN
WAS LAID TO REST,

00:11:34.727 --> 00:11:38.798
I'VE BEEN GATHERING
THE ENERGY NECESSARY
TO FUEL ITS REBIRTH.

00:11:38.798 --> 00:11:42.401
COME ON, YOU EXPECT US
TO BELIEVE THAT JUNK?

00:11:42.401 --> 00:11:44.036
YE OF LITTLE FAITH.

00:11:44.036 --> 00:11:47.873
JUST DUEL ME
AND I PROMISE I'LL MAKE
A BELIEVER OUT OF YOU,

00:11:47.873 --> 00:11:51.477
FOR WHEN YOU LOSE,
THERE WILL BE
NO DENYING MY POWER.

00:11:51.477 --> 00:11:53.913
THEN LET'S STOP TALKING
AND START DUELING.

00:11:53.913 --> 00:11:56.415
YOU CAN'T, KAIBA--
NOT ALONE.

00:11:56.415 --> 00:11:59.085
THIS LUNATIC
IS FAR TOO DANGEROUS.

00:11:59.085 --> 00:12:01.087
SO WHY DON'T YOU
JOIN HIM?

00:12:01.087 --> 00:12:02.488
AND WHEN I DEFEAT YOU,

00:12:02.488 --> 00:12:04.757
I'LL GET TWO SOULS
FOR THE PRICE OF ONE.

00:12:04.757 --> 00:12:09.562
[LAUGHING]

00:12:09.562 --> 00:12:10.763
ALL RIGHT.

00:12:10.763 --> 00:12:11.764
READY, KAIBA?

00:12:11.764 --> 00:12:13.299
I'M WAY AHEAD OF YOU.

00:12:23.657 --> 00:12:27.661
DON'T WORRY,
I'LL SAVE YOU BOTH.

00:12:27.661 --> 00:12:31.364
MARK MY WORDS,
DARTZ IS GONNA PAY.

00:12:34.534 --> 00:12:37.938
Dartz: GENTLEMEN,
LET THE GAMES COMMENCE.

00:12:37.938 --> 00:12:39.439
OH, MAN.

00:12:39.439 --> 00:12:40.941
THIS IS IT.

00:12:40.941 --> 00:12:42.108
I'LL GO FIRST.

00:12:42.108 --> 00:12:44.244
STAND BACK.

00:12:44.244 --> 00:12:49.082
I ACTIVATE
THE MAGIC CARD
WHITE DRAGON RITUAL.

00:12:49.082 --> 00:12:51.584
THAT MEANS
I CAN DO THIS.

00:12:51.584 --> 00:12:53.420
I DISCARD
MY VORSE RAIDER

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:58.625
IN ORDER TO SUMMON
PALADIN OF WHITE DRAGON.

00:12:58.625 --> 00:13:01.728
BUT WAIT,
BECAUSE HERE COMES
THE BEST PART.

00:13:01.728 --> 00:13:06.666
I SACRIFICE MY PALADIN
TO BRING OUT MY ULTIMATE
FIGHTING MACHINE.

00:13:06.666 --> 00:13:10.370
AND NOW, MEET BLUE-EYES
WHITE DRAGON!

00:13:21.982 --> 00:13:25.151
AS MUCH AS I'D LOVE
TO BLAST YOU,

00:13:25.151 --> 00:13:26.786
I'M NOT PERMITTED
TO ATTACK

00:13:26.786 --> 00:13:28.655
SINCE THIS
WAS MY FIRST MOVE.

00:13:28.655 --> 00:13:31.925
SO I'LL LET MY PARTNER
TAKE OVER NOW.

00:13:31.925 --> 00:13:33.593
DON'T MIND IF I DO.

00:13:33.593 --> 00:13:36.429
HERE GOES!

00:13:36.429 --> 00:13:37.497
FIRST, I'LL ACTIVATE

00:13:37.497 --> 00:13:41.468
MY BLACK
LUSTER RITUAL,

00:13:41.468 --> 00:13:43.336
WHICH LETS ME
SACRIFICE

00:13:43.336 --> 00:13:48.174
MY VALKYRION
THE MAGNA WARRIOR

00:13:48.174 --> 00:13:51.978
IN ORDER TO SUMMON
MY BLACK LUSTER
SOLDIER!

00:13:54.614 --> 00:13:57.017
THAT SHOULD GIVE YOU
PLENTY TO DEAL WITH,

00:13:57.017 --> 00:13:59.686
SO I'LL END MY TURN.

00:13:59.686 --> 00:14:00.920
ALL RIGHT!

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:02.589
DARTZ BETTER WATCH OUT.

00:14:02.589 --> 00:14:06.226
THEY JUST SUMMONED
TWO MAJOR LEAGUE MONSTERS
ON THEIR FIRST TURN.

00:14:06.226 --> 00:14:09.896
THOSE PATHETIC CREATURES
MAY WORK IN YOUR
LITTLE CARD TOURNAMENTS,

00:14:09.896 --> 00:14:14.167
BUT I'M AFRAID
I PLAY A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT GAME--

00:14:14.167 --> 00:14:17.337
A GAME IN WHICH
THE WINNER TAKES ALL

00:14:17.337 --> 00:14:19.939
AND THE LOSER PAYS
THE ULTIMATE PRICE.

00:14:26.012 --> 00:14:29.249
THIS CARD WAS BORN
FROM THE DARKNESS ITSELF.

00:14:29.249 --> 00:14:32.385
[ECHOES]

00:14:32.385 --> 00:14:37.557
BEHOLD A POWER
THAT HAS EXISTED
SINCE THE DAWN OF TIME,

00:14:37.557 --> 00:14:41.594
THE VERY POWER
THAT SHALL STRIP YOU
OF YOUR SOULS.

00:14:41.594 --> 00:14:43.096
OH, NO.

00:14:43.096 --> 00:14:45.098

00:14:58.011 --> 00:14:59.279
DO YOU FEEL THAT?

00:14:59.279 --> 00:15:01.181
IF YOU MEAN THE SUDDEN
DROP IN TEMPERATURE

00:15:01.181 --> 00:15:03.083
AND THAT FREAKY
EVIL VIBE IN THE AIR,

00:15:03.083 --> 00:15:04.584
THEN, YES, I DO.

00:15:04.584 --> 00:15:06.486
ME, TOO.

00:15:06.486 --> 00:15:08.588
Dartz: NOW THAT I'VE SET
THE TONE FOR THIS DUEL,

00:15:08.588 --> 00:15:11.758
ALLOW ME TO CONTINUE.

00:15:11.758 --> 00:15:13.326
WATCH THIS.

00:15:13.326 --> 00:15:16.262
ARISE,
ORICHALCOS GIGAS!

00:15:19.499 --> 00:15:21.234
I FACED
THIS BEAST BEFORE,

00:15:21.234 --> 00:15:24.737
AND IT WAS ALMOST
IMPOSSIBLE TO DESTROY,
KAIBA.

00:15:24.737 --> 00:15:28.007
THAT'S BECAUSE LAST TIME
YOU DIDN'T HAVE ME
TO BAIL YOU OUT.

00:15:28.007 --> 00:15:33.346
NEXT I'LL SACRIFICE
500 OF MY LIFE POINTS.

00:15:33.346 --> 00:15:36.749
THAT LETS ME SUMMON
MY ORICHALCOS KYUTORA,

00:15:36.749 --> 00:15:38.818
AND THANKS TO THE SEAL,

00:15:38.818 --> 00:15:41.387
IT GETS AN ADDITIONAL
500 POINTS.

00:15:41.387 --> 00:15:44.424
ALL RIGHT,
I GUESS THAT'LL
DO FOR NOW.

00:15:44.424 --> 00:15:47.694
THEN ALLOW ME.

HOW SAD.

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:56.836
I ACTUALLY BELIEVED
I WAS UP AGAINST
A TALENTED DUELIST

00:15:56.836 --> 00:16:00.173
UNTIL I WITNESSED
YOUR POOR EXCUSE
FOR AN OPENING MOVE.

00:16:00.173 --> 00:16:04.344
YOU LEFT TWO WEAK MONSTERS
OUT ON THE FIELD
WITH NO PROTECTION,

00:16:04.344 --> 00:16:07.747
AND THANKS TO THIS,
I'M ABOUT TO BLOW THEM AWAY.

00:16:07.747 --> 00:16:10.884
GUESS YOU SHOULD
HAVE THOUGHT TWICE
BEFORE CHALLENGING ME.

00:16:10.884 --> 00:16:14.554
I'M PRESIDENT
OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST
GAMING CORPORATION.

00:16:14.554 --> 00:16:16.222
YOU KNOW WHY?

00:16:16.222 --> 00:16:19.092
BECAUSE NO ONE'S MASTERED
THE GAME OF DUEL MONSTERS
LIKE I HAVE.

00:16:19.092 --> 00:16:20.493
SO CHECK THIS OUT!

00:16:20.493 --> 00:16:23.830
I PLAY THE MAGIC CARD
POLYMERIZATION.

00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:27.000
THIS LETS ME FUSE
THE TWO BLUE-EYES IN MY HAND

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.269
WITH THE ONE I HAVE
ON THE FIELD.

00:16:35.508 --> 00:16:39.979
SHOW YOURSELF,
BLUE-EYES ULTIMATE DRAGON!

00:16:49.737 --> 00:16:53.074
ALL RIGHT,
TIME TO PICK UP
WHERE KAIBA LEFT OFF.

00:16:53.074 --> 00:16:56.744
YOU'LL NEVER WITHSTAND
THE COMBINED POWER
OF OUR DUELING DECKS

00:16:56.744 --> 00:17:00.681
AND I'M ABOUT
TO PROVE IT, DARTZ,
WITH THIS--

00:17:00.681 --> 00:17:03.251
MY POLYMERIZATION
MAGIC CARD.

00:17:03.251 --> 00:17:05.920
AND I'LL USE IT
TO FUSE KAIBA'S DRAGON

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:07.922
WITH MY BLACK LUSTER
SOLDIER

00:17:07.922 --> 00:17:10.525

A NEW MONSTER.

OF DRAGON SOLDIER!

MAN, TALK ABOUT
THE DREAM TEAM!

00:17:27.241 --> 00:17:30.912
I REVEAL MY TRAP CARD,
METEOR RAIN.

00:17:30.912 --> 00:17:32.713
WITH THIS CARD,
YOU LOSE THE DIFFERENCE

00:17:32.713 --> 00:17:34.749
BETWEEN MY MONSTER'S
ATTACK POINTS

00:17:34.749 --> 00:17:37.018
AND THE DEFENSE POINTS
OF YOUR MONSTER.

00:17:37.018 --> 00:17:38.519
IF MY MATH IS RIGHT,

00:17:38.519 --> 00:17:41.522
THAT'S A DIFFERENCE
OF 3,500!

00:17:41.522 --> 00:17:44.091
THAT'S ENOUGH
TO LEAVE DARTZ WITH ZIP.

00:17:44.091 --> 00:17:47.195
IT'S TIME
TO TAKE YOU DOWN
AND FREE MY FRIENDS.

00:17:47.195 --> 00:17:49.997

OF DRAGON SOLDIER!

00:17:49.997 --> 00:17:52.166
ATTACK HIS
ORICHALCOS GIGAS

00:17:52.166 --> 00:17:55.169
AND WIPE OUT WHAT'S LEFT
OF HIS LIFE POINTS.

00:17:55.169 --> 00:17:58.105
YOUR TWISTED GAME
IS DONE.

00:17:58.105 --> 00:17:59.607
END THIS DUEL...

WHY WE'RE FLOATING
IN SPACE?

I DON'T KNOW.

IT'S DARTZ.

I'D SUGGEST
YOU TAKE US BACK.

00:19:08.175 --> 00:19:09.744
BUT WE NEVER LEFT.

00:19:09.744 --> 00:19:11.412
WHAT YOU'RE
EXPERIENCING RIGHT NOW

00:19:11.412 --> 00:19:14.415
IS MERELY A VISION
GENERATED BY ORICHALCOS.

00:19:14.415 --> 00:19:16.751
THAT'S HOW
THE SEAL COMMUNICATES.

00:19:16.751 --> 00:19:19.253
IT SHOWS US IMAGES OF
THINGS AS THEY WERE

00:19:19.253 --> 00:19:21.355
OR AS THEY MIGHT
ONE DAY BE.

00:19:21.355 --> 00:19:22.590
JUST LOOK.

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:26.260
THIS IS THE DARKNESS
THAT HAS ALWAYS EXISTED.

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:28.663
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING
TO PROVE WITH ALL THIS?

00:19:28.663 --> 00:19:31.999

SPEND EVERY SECOND
OF THEIR LIVES

AND NOW AT THE CORE
OF EVERYONE'S HEART

00:19:42.009 --> 00:19:44.145
YOU'LL FIND PURE DARKNESS,

00:19:44.145 --> 00:19:47.715
AND WHEN A HUMAN BEING
CROSSES PATHS
WITH THE ORICHALCOS,

THE EVIL INSIDE
IS SET FREE.

IT WAS ON THIS VERY DAY,
10,000 YEARS AGO,

00:19:53.587 --> 00:19:56.524
THAT I CAME INTO CONTACT
WITH THIS POWERFUL FORCE

I SHOULD HAVE EXPECTED
SUCH IGNORANCE
FROM YOU, PHARAOH.

00:20:05.633 --> 00:20:09.570
YOU CHOOSE
TO SHUT YOURSELF OFF
FROM THE TRUTH,

00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:13.074
JUST AS MY PEOPLE DID
SO LONG AGO

00:20:13.074 --> 00:20:16.711
WHEN I PRESIDED OVER
PARADISE ON EARTH.

00:20:23.351 --> 00:20:25.319
WHAT'S THAT?

00:20:25.319 --> 00:20:28.589
YOU'RE GETTING A GLIMPSE
OF THE LEGENDARY CITY
OF ATLANTIS

00:20:28.589 --> 00:20:33.361
AS IT WAS 10,000 YEARS AGO
WHEN I RULED AS KING.

00:20:33.361 --> 00:20:34.895
YOU WERE KING?

00:20:34.895 --> 00:20:39.000
INDEED I WAS,
AND I SHALL BE ONCE AGAIN.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.470
FOR WHEN I DEFEAT YOU,
PARADISE SHALL RETURN!
