00:18:03.656 --> 00:18:05.125
YOU'RE WRONG!

00:18:05.125 --> 00:18:07.396
I NEVER ATTACKED, SO
YOU DIDN'T LOSE THE DUEL.

00:18:07.396 --> 00:18:11.336
Joey: BUT I'M TOO
EXHAUSTED TO FINISH.

00:18:11.336 --> 00:18:15.510
I WON'T LET THE ORICHALCOS
TAKE YOU AWAY, JOEY.

00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:17.514
IT'S TOO LATE
FOR THAT.

00:18:17.514 --> 00:18:21.288
I ALREADY LOST
THE DUEL, SO THERE'S
NO TURNING BACK.

00:18:21.288 --> 00:18:24.694
I'M JUST GLAD THAT
IF ONE OF US HAD
TO LOSE OUR SOUL,

00:18:24.694 --> 00:18:26.096
IT DIDN'T HAVE
TO BE YOU, MAI.

00:18:26.096 --> 00:18:28.366
DON'T SAY THAT.

00:18:28.366 --> 00:18:30.737
HEY, MAI, THAT WAS

00:18:30.737 --> 00:18:32.875
ONE OF
THE GREATEST DUELS
I EVER FOUGHT.

00:18:32.875 --> 00:18:38.218
THANK YOU.

00:18:38.218 --> 00:18:44.128
JOEY! NOOOO!

00:18:44.128 --> 00:18:46.198
SHE'S BEEN SET FREE.

00:18:46.198 --> 00:18:48.703
AHHH, BUT WHAT'S THIS?

00:18:48.703 --> 00:18:52.576
IT SEEMS MS. VALENTINE
HAS SERVED HER PURPOSE.

00:18:52.576 --> 00:18:54.514
OH, NO!

00:18:54.514 --> 00:18:55.482
WHAT'S WRONG?

00:18:55.482 --> 00:18:57.920
IS IT JOEY?

00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:59.589
I'M AFRAID SO.

00:18:59.589 --> 00:19:04.665
[GROWLING]

00:19:08.372 --> 00:19:12.078
Mokuba: WHAT'S UP
WITH CRITIAS?

00:19:12.078 --> 00:19:13.881
THERE MUST BE
SOME KIND OF GLITCH

00:19:13.881 --> 00:19:17.488
IN THE HOLOGRAPHIC
IMAGE.

00:19:17.488 --> 00:19:20.326
JOEY! WAIT!

00:19:20.326 --> 00:19:22.830
SNAP OUT OF IT!

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:25.001
THIS IS ALL
MY FAULT.

00:19:25.001 --> 00:19:26.871
I WAS ANGRY
AND CONFUSED,

00:19:26.871 --> 00:19:29.475
AND I BLAMED ALL
MY LONELINESS ON YOU.

00:19:29.475 --> 00:19:31.880
SO I TRIED
TO GET RID OF YOU.

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:34.418
HOW COULD I BE
SO SELFISH?

00:19:34.418 --> 00:19:37.290
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO EVER CARED ABOUT ME.

00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:38.926
[SOBBING]

00:19:38.926 --> 00:19:42.466
YOU'RE THE CLOSEST
FRIEND I EVER HAD,

00:19:42.466 --> 00:19:44.302
AND HOW DID I REPAY YOU?

00:19:44.302 --> 00:19:49.545
BY LEAVING YOU
FOR A MADMAN WHO
PROMISED ME POWER.

00:19:49.545 --> 00:19:53.418
I'LL MAKE HIM REGRET
THE DAY HE EVER MET
MAI VALENTINE.

00:19:56.925 --> 00:20:00.932
THE ONLY WAY TO FIX THIS IS
TO MEET DARTZ FACE TO FACE.

00:20:10.683 --> 00:20:12.887
HERE GOES NOTHING.

00:20:24.541 --> 00:20:27.312
HEY, DARTZ,
IS THAT YOU?

00:20:27.312 --> 00:20:28.448
GUESS AGAIN,
MAI.

00:20:28.448 --> 00:20:30.886
HUH? WHAT DO YOU WANT?

00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:38.800
NO WAY.

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:40.207
WHAT HAPPENED?

00:20:40.207 --> 00:20:42.710
HE LOST THE DUEL.

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:45.279
Tea: WAIT.
DOES THAT MEAN--

00:20:45.279 --> 00:20:48.282
Yami-Yugi: YES. HIS SOUL
BELONGS TO DARTZ NOW.
