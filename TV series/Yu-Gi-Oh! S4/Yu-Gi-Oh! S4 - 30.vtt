00:10:00.834 --> 00:10:02.969
'CAUSE NOW
IT'S JUST YOU AND ME.

00:10:03.636 --> 00:10:04.637
THE WINNER LEAVES
A FREE MAN.

00:10:05.305 --> 00:10:07.674
THE LOSER BECOMES
A PRISONER TO THE BEAST!

00:10:08.341 --> 00:10:09.342
YOU'RE ON!

00:10:10.009 --> 00:10:12.479
IF THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES
TO SET MY FRIENDS FREE,
THEN LET'S DUEL.

00:10:13.146 --> 00:10:14.314
AND ONCE YOU'RE
OUT OF MY WAY,

00:10:14.981 --> 00:10:16.716
I CAN GO STRAIGHT
FOR DARTZ.

00:10:17.383 --> 00:10:19.319
IT'S JUST A SHAME
THAT A DUELIST
WITH YOUR TALENTS

00:10:19.986 --> 00:10:22.222
HAS TO THROW IT ALL AWAY
BY FOLLOWING A MADMAN.

00:10:22.889 --> 00:10:24.657
LOOK, MASTER DARTZ
OPENED ME UP TO THE TRUTH

00:10:25.325 --> 00:10:26.860
AND MADE ME
WHO I AM TODAY.

00:10:27.527 --> 00:10:30.663
YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS
BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE
ONE OF THESE, RIGHT?

00:10:31.331 --> 00:10:33.333
WELL, NOT ANYMORE, ANYWAY.

00:10:33.967 --> 00:10:36.402
YOU CAN'T TEMPT ME
WITH THAT AGAIN, RAFAEL.

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:39.038
I WASN'T PLANNING ON IT,

00:10:39.706 --> 00:10:42.876
BUT YOU CAN HAVE
ONE LAST LOOK AT IT
WHILE YOU SHUFFLE MY DECK...

00:10:43.543 --> 00:10:45.378
FOR OLD TIME'S SAKE.

00:10:46.045 --> 00:10:47.947
I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO,
AND IT WON'T WORK.

00:10:48.615 --> 00:10:50.183
I WON'T GIVE IN
TO MY DARK SIDE.

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:52.118
WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

00:10:52.785 --> 00:10:54.921
I MUST STAY TRUE
TO MY HEART,

00:10:55.588 --> 00:10:57.624
NO MATTER WHAT
HE TRIES TO DO.

00:11:03.062 --> 00:11:03.863
MAY THE BEST MAN WIN...

00:11:04.531 --> 00:11:08.234
AND WHEN I DO,
YOU'LL BE GONE FOREVER.

00:11:08.902 --> 00:11:09.903
I'M GONNA ENJOY THIS.

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:12.839
[LAUGHING]

00:11:17.911 --> 00:11:19.479
Both: TIME TO DUEL!

00:11:27.487 --> 00:11:28.922
SINCE I'M
THE RETURNING CHAMPION,

00:11:29.589 --> 00:11:30.590
I'LL START THINGS OFF.

00:11:31.257 --> 00:11:32.892
READY?

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:38.431
Rafael, voice-over:
THIS'LL BE A NICE WAY
TO KICK OFF THE FESTIVITIES.

00:11:39.098 --> 00:11:40.333
I PLAY GUARDIAN TREASURE.

00:11:40.967 --> 00:11:43.303
THIS MAGIC CARD
LETS ME DRAW TWO NEW CARDS

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:46.206
AS SOON AS I GET RID
OF THE 5 I'M HOLDING.

00:11:46.873 --> 00:11:49.309
PLUS, I CAN DRAW
TWO CARDS EVERY TURN
FROM NOW ON

00:11:49.976 --> 00:11:54.314
AS LONG AS GUARDIAN TREASURE
IS ON THE FIELD.

00:11:54.981 --> 00:11:57.016
AND NEXT,
I'LL SUMMON MY TRUSTY
BACKUP GARDNA

00:11:57.684 --> 00:11:58.651
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:11:59.319 --> 00:12:02.355
THEN I'LL PLACE
ONE CARD FACE-DOWN
AND GIVE YOU A SHOT.

00:12:03.022 --> 00:12:04.057
VERY WELL, THEN.

00:12:04.724 --> 00:12:08.828
NOW I CALL FORTH
MY QUEEN'S KNIGHT
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:12:10.263 --> 00:12:11.631
THAT ENDS MY TURN.

00:12:12.298 --> 00:12:12.999
Yami-Yugi, voice-over:
I'M SURPRISED
HE DIDN'T PLAY

00:12:13.666 --> 00:12:15.501
THE SEAL OF ORICHALCOS
RIGHT AWAY.

00:12:16.169 --> 00:12:18.071
PERHAPS
HE'S TOYING WITH ME.

00:12:18.738 --> 00:12:19.205
THAT'S ALL YOU GOT?

00:12:19.872 --> 00:12:21.241
HOW SAD.

00:12:21.908 --> 00:12:23.042
THIS SHOULD BE FUN.

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:26.546
IT'S TIME TO REMIND YOU
WHY I'VE ALREADY
CRUSHED YOU ONCE

00:12:27.213 --> 00:12:29.616
BY REUNITING YOU
WITH A FRIEND
FROM OUR LAST DUEL.

00:12:30.283 --> 00:12:33.152
YOU REMEMBER GRAVITY AXE,
DON'T YOU?

00:12:36.322 --> 00:12:38.157
AND NOW FOR
ITS SPECIAL ABILITY--

00:12:38.825 --> 00:12:41.828
IT ALLOWS ME
TO SUMMON MY GUARDIAN GRARL.

00:12:42.495 --> 00:12:43.830
AND THANKS
TO HIS HANDY WEAPON,

00:12:44.497 --> 00:12:47.700
MY GUARDIAN GAINS
AN EXTRA 500 POINTS.

00:12:53.906 --> 00:12:55.642
ALL RIGHT,
GUARDIAN GRARL, ATTACK!

00:12:56.309 --> 00:12:59.112
DESTROY
HIS QUEEN'S KNIGHT!

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:05.985
THAT'S ENOUGH PUNISHMENT
FOR NOW.

00:13:06.653 --> 00:13:07.320
GOOD.

00:13:07.987 --> 00:13:09.956
THEN I'LL ACTIVATE
MY MONSTER REBORN CARD,

00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:14.527
AND I'M USING IT
TO BRING BACK
MY QUEEN'S NIGHT.

00:13:15.194 --> 00:13:18.731
THEN I'LL SUMMON
MY KING'S KNIGHT
TO THE FIELD

00:13:19.399 --> 00:13:21.200
AND I'LL ACTIVATE HIS
SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:13:21.868 --> 00:13:23.703
SO, NOW,
SINCE MY KING'S KNIGHT

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:25.538
AND MY QUEEN'S KNIGHT
ARE BOTH IN PLAY,

00:13:26.205 --> 00:13:28.541
I'M ABLE TO COMPLETE
MY ROYAL TEAM WITH THIS,

00:13:29.208 --> 00:13:31.978
MY JACK'S KNIGHT
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:13:32.645 --> 00:13:33.479
BUT I'M NOT DONE YET.

00:13:34.147 --> 00:13:35.648
I PLAY BRAVE ATTACK.

00:13:36.316 --> 00:13:37.383
I KNOW THAT CARD.

00:13:38.051 --> 00:13:41.220
AND NOW I ACTIVATE
BRAVE ATTACK,

00:13:41.888 --> 00:13:44.557
SENDING MY WARRIORS
INTO BATTLE.

00:13:49.095 --> 00:13:49.429
THAT'S ALL?

00:13:50.096 --> 00:13:53.333
NO. BETA, ATTACK!

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.436
NOW, GAMMA,
FINISH HIM OFF.

00:14:00.139 --> 00:14:00.707
OF COURSE.

00:14:01.374 --> 00:14:03.409
YOU USED IT TO BEAT
OBELISK THE TORMENTOR.

00:14:04.077 --> 00:14:04.877
YES.

00:14:05.545 --> 00:14:06.512
BRAVE ATTACK LETS ME
ADD THE ATTACK POINTS

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:09.115
OF ALL 3
OF MY MONSTERS TOGETHER.

00:14:09.782 --> 00:14:12.151
ALTHOUGH MY MONSTERS
ARE DESTROYED
AFTER THEY ATTACK,

00:14:12.819 --> 00:14:13.586
SO IS YOUR GUARDIAN.

00:14:14.253 --> 00:14:15.555
I SEE YOU HAVEN'T
LEARNED YOUR LESSON

00:14:16.222 --> 00:14:17.623
ABOUT RESPECTING
YOUR MONSTERS,

00:14:18.291 --> 00:14:19.625
EVEN THOUGH
THAT'S WHAT DID YOU IN
LAST TIME.

00:14:20.293 --> 00:14:25.131
RAFAEL, NOW IT'S TIME
FOR ME TO TEACH YOU
A LESSON ABOUT TEAMWORK.

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:29.836
SO WATCH
AS MY 3 MONSTERS
JOIN TOGETHER

00:14:30.503 --> 00:14:33.139
IN A UNIFIED EFFORT
TO DESTROY YOUR BEAST!

00:14:33.806 --> 00:14:35.541
NOW ATTACK, MY KNIGHTS!

00:14:36.209 --> 00:14:38.211
DESTROY
HIS GUARDIAN GRARL

00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:41.481
WITH TRIPLE
MAJESTIC SLASH!

00:14:43.282 --> 00:14:44.450
NOT SO FAST, PHARAOH.

00:14:45.118 --> 00:14:46.886
REVEAL GUARDIAN FORCE.

00:14:47.553 --> 00:14:49.155
THIS TRAP CARD
DEACTIVATES AND DESTROYS

00:14:49.822 --> 00:14:51.224
ANY MAGIC CARD
THAT I CHOOSE--

00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:56.362
AS LONG AS THERE AREN'T
ANY GUARDIAN MONSTERS
IN MY GRAVEYARD, THAT IS.

00:14:59.665 --> 00:15:02.235
NOW YOUR KNIGHTS
CAN'T TOUCH MY MONSTER.

00:15:02.902 --> 00:15:03.870
SO MUCH FOR ALL
YOUR BLABBERING

00:15:04.537 --> 00:15:06.038
ABOUT TEAMWORK,
EH, PHARAOH?

00:15:06.706 --> 00:15:08.541
I'LL END MY TURN.

00:15:09.208 --> 00:15:10.209
Yami-Yugi, voice-over:
HE RUINED MY STRATEGY.

00:15:10.877 --> 00:15:12.812
NOW ALL 3 OF MY KNIGHTS
ARE OPEN FOR ATTACK.

00:15:13.479 --> 00:15:15.148
I NEED A NEW PLAN.

00:15:15.815 --> 00:15:16.783
YOU'RE GOING DOWN.

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:18.151
WATCH.

00:15:18.818 --> 00:15:19.652
OH, NO.

00:15:20.319 --> 00:15:22.555
IF HE PLAYS THE SEAL
OF ORICHALCOS NOW,
I'M IN TROUBLE,

00:15:23.222 --> 00:15:24.891
BECAUSE IF RAFAEL WINS
WITH THAT ON THE FIELD,

00:15:25.558 --> 00:15:27.026
I'LL NEVER SAVE
MY FRIENDS.

00:15:27.693 --> 00:15:32.398
NOW I PLAY BUTTERFLY DAGGER.

00:15:33.065 --> 00:15:37.437
THIS WEAPON GIVES
MY BACKUP GUARDIAN
300 EXTRA ATTACK POINTS.

00:15:39.205 --> 00:15:43.009
IT ALSO ALLOWS ME
TO SUMMON MY GUARDIAN ELMA.

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:46.579
I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT
GUARDIAN MONSTER.

00:15:47.246 --> 00:15:50.049
THERE ARE PLENTY
OF MONSTERS IN MY DECK
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN,

00:15:50.716 --> 00:15:54.287
AND THIS ONE LETS ME
BRING MY GUARDIAN SHIELD
BACK FROM THE GRAVEYARD,

00:15:54.954 --> 00:15:57.824
AND I'LL GIVE IT
TO GUARDIAN ELMA.

00:15:59.492 --> 00:16:01.794
PLUS, MY BACKUP GARDNA'S
SPECIAL ABILITY

00:16:02.462 --> 00:16:06.732
TRANSFERS
MY BUTTERFLY DAGGER
TO GUARDIAN ELMA.

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:11.671
NOW, GUARDIAN ELMA,
ATTACK HIS QUEEN'S KNIGHT!

00:16:17.176 --> 00:16:18.878
GUARDIAN GRARL,
IT'S YOUR TURN NOW.

00:16:19.545 --> 00:16:23.449
ATTACK HIS KING'S KNIGHT
WITH GRAVITY AXE!

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:32.792
WHAT NOW, PHARAOH?

00:16:34.627 --> 00:16:38.331
ONE PUNY KNIGHT
STANDS BETWEEN ME
AND YOUR LIFE POINTS.

00:16:45.271 --> 00:16:46.405
IT'S MY MOVE,

00:16:47.073 --> 00:16:49.342
AND I ACTIVATE
THE MAGIC CARD
5-STAR TWILIGHT.

00:16:50.009 --> 00:16:52.512
SINCE MY JACK'S KNIGHT
IS A 5-STAR MONSTER,

00:16:53.179 --> 00:16:54.780
I CAN SACRIFICE HIM
TO CALL FORTH

00:16:55.448 --> 00:16:58.317
THE 5 KURIBOH BROTHERS!

00:16:58.985 --> 00:16:59.418
OH, NO.

00:17:00.152 --> 00:17:00.853
I'M SO SCARED.

00:17:01.521 --> 00:17:04.423
BY DISCARDING ONE TRAP
TO MY CARD GRAVEYARD,

00:17:05.091 --> 00:17:06.692
I ACTIVATE
THEIR SPECIAL EFFECT--

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:08.728
KURIBALL!

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:22.742
WHAT DID YOU JUST DO
TO MY GUARDIAN?

00:17:23.409 --> 00:17:25.344
HE WAS WEAKENED BY
MY KURIBOH BROTHERS.

00:17:26.012 --> 00:17:26.812
THANKS TO THEM,

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:29.248
YOUR GUARDIAN'S ONLY
HALF THE MONSTER
IT ONCE WAS,

00:17:29.916 --> 00:17:31.751
SO IT'S TIME FOR ME
TO FINISH HIM OFF.

00:17:32.418 --> 00:17:34.587
NOW, KURIBOH BROTHERS,
COMBINE!

00:17:35.254 --> 00:17:38.958
TRANSFORM YOURSELVES
INTO KURIBABYLON!

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:41.360
ONE PROBLEM--

00:17:42.028 --> 00:17:43.029
YOUR POWDERPUFF
AND MY GRARL

00:17:43.696 --> 00:17:44.931
HAVE THE SAME
ATTACK STRENGTH.

00:17:45.598 --> 00:17:47.633
THAT'S TRUE,
BUT I NEVER SAID
THAT I WAS FINISHED,

00:17:48.267 --> 00:17:49.001
SO WATCH AS I ACTIVATE

00:17:49.669 --> 00:17:50.736
MY MYSTICAL
SPACE TYPHOON.

00:17:51.404 --> 00:17:52.305
OH, NO!

00:17:52.972 --> 00:17:55.675
THIS POWERFUL CARD
ALLOWS ME TO DESTROY
A TRAP OR MAGIC CARD

00:17:56.342 --> 00:17:57.510
ON YOUR SIDE
OF THE FIELD,

00:17:58.177 --> 00:18:00.780
AND I CHOSE
YOUR GRAVITY AXE.

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:06.085
AND NOW, KURIBABYLON,

00:18:06.752 --> 00:18:09.889
DESTROY HIS
GUARDIAN GRARL!

00:18:10.556 --> 00:18:13.593
ELMA, BLOCK HIS ATTACK.

00:18:19.198 --> 00:18:20.766
ALLOW ME TO EXPLAIN.

00:18:21.434 --> 00:18:23.469
THE SPECIAL ABILITY
OF MY GUARDIAN SHIELD

00:18:24.136 --> 00:18:27.607
ALLOWS ME TO PROTECT
ANY OF MY MONSTERS
FROM BEING DESTROYED.

00:18:28.274 --> 00:18:32.912
HOWEVER, USING IT COSTS ME
500 OF MY LIFE POINTS.

00:18:33.579 --> 00:18:34.680
Yami-Yugi, voice-over:
HE GAVE UP
HIS OWN STRENGTH

00:18:35.348 --> 00:18:37.083
TO SAVE HIS MONSTER.

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:41.253
I'LL PLACE
ONE CARD FACE DOWN
AND END MY TURN.

00:18:41.921 --> 00:18:42.822
Yami-Yugi, voice-over:
I'VE NEVER COME
ACROSS A DUELIST

00:18:43.489 --> 00:18:44.523
LIKE HIM BEFORE.

00:18:45.191 --> 00:18:46.692
HE REFUSES TO LET
ANY OF HIS MONSTERS

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:48.527
GO TO THE CARD
GRAVEYARD.

00:18:49.195 --> 00:18:50.696
HE PROTECTS THEM
AT ALL COSTS.

00:18:51.364 --> 00:18:52.198
WHY WOULD
A DUELIST LIKE THIS

00:18:52.865 --> 00:18:55.501
HOLD A CARD LIKE
THE SEAL OF ORICHALCOS?

00:18:57.236 --> 00:19:00.740
RAFAEL,
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

00:19:01.407 --> 00:19:02.408
AS LONG AS YOU'RE
LOYAL TO DARTZ,

00:19:03.075 --> 00:19:04.410
YOU'LL NEVER BE TRUE
TO YOURSELF.

00:19:05.077 --> 00:19:06.746
YOU HAVE TOO MUCH
RESPECT FOR YOUR CARDS

00:19:07.413 --> 00:19:09.081
TO USE THEM FOR SUCH
AN EVIL PURPOSE.

00:19:09.749 --> 00:19:10.583
BUT DARTZ
HAS BRAINWASHED YOU

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:12.785
INTO BELIEVING
YOU'RE SOMEONE ELSE.

00:19:13.452 --> 00:19:14.754
THE ONLY THING
MASTER DARTZ DID

00:19:15.421 --> 00:19:16.722
WAS OPEN MY EYES
TO THE TRUTH.

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:18.658
YOU'RE WRONG.

00:19:19.325 --> 00:19:20.726
THIS WORLD
IS AN EVIL PLACE,

00:19:21.394 --> 00:19:22.528
AND YOU'RE PART
OF THE PROBLEM.

00:19:23.195 --> 00:19:24.597
SO I'M HERE TO FIX THAT.

00:19:25.264 --> 00:19:26.432
AND THANKS TO MY MASTER,

00:19:27.099 --> 00:19:29.402
I HAVE JUST
THE TOOL TO DO IT.

00:19:30.069 --> 00:19:33.239
NOW, I PLAY
THE SEAL OF ORICHALCOS.

00:19:33.906 --> 00:19:34.340
NO, RAFAEL!

00:19:35.007 --> 00:19:36.709
PLEASE, DON'T!

00:19:37.376 --> 00:19:39.812
SORRY, PHARAOH,
IT'S TOO LATE FOR THAT NOW.

00:19:40.479 --> 00:19:42.415
YOUR FATE IS SEALED.

00:19:45.918 --> 00:19:49.522
HEY, LOOK, GUYS,
IT'S MAI.

00:19:50.189 --> 00:19:50.756
Mokuba: OH, MAN.

00:19:51.424 --> 00:19:54.260
DON'T TELL ME
SHE LOST HER SOUL, TOO.

00:19:54.927 --> 00:19:56.162
I DON'T MEAN
TO SOUND INSENSITIVE,

00:19:56.829 --> 00:19:58.164
BUT WHO'S CARRYING HER?

00:20:00.933 --> 00:20:02.935
Yami-Yugi, voice-over:
YOU'RE MAKING A MISTAKE.

00:20:05.171 --> 00:20:08.407
RAFAEL, NO!

00:20:17.349 --> 00:20:18.017
PHARAOH!

00:20:18.684 --> 00:20:19.185
OH, NO.

00:20:19.852 --> 00:20:21.153
WE'RE TOO LATE.

00:20:21.821 --> 00:20:25.091
THAT GUY ALREADY
PLAYED THE SEAL
OF ORICHALCOS.

00:20:25.758 --> 00:20:26.892
Yami-Yugi, voice-over:
THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING.

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.962
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE,
RAFAEL?

00:20:35.334 --> 00:20:37.236
THAT'S MORE LIKE IT.

00:20:45.878 --> 00:20:48.881
