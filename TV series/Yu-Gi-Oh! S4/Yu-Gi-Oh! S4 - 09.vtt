00:09:08.578 --> 00:09:10.482

AND I HAFTA DRAW ONE!

00:09:12.252 --> 00:09:13.755
IF I CHOOSE
MY OWN CARD

00:09:13.755 --> 00:09:15.258
YOUR ATTACK
GETS BLOCKED!

00:09:15.258 --> 00:09:16.828
SO I HAVE
A 1 IN 3 CHANCE

00:09:16.828 --> 00:09:18.431

PAST THIS ROUND!

00:09:18.431 --> 00:09:20.068

BY PLAYING
A GAME OF CHANCE.

00:09:32.758 --> 00:09:34.562
HE'LL NEVER PICK
THE RIGHT CARD.

00:09:34.562 --> 00:09:36.231
IT'S OVER.

00:09:36.231 --> 00:09:38.703

YOU'RE STILL RELYING

00:10:02.114 --> 00:10:03.618

00:10:40.922 --> 00:10:42.258

LOOKS LIKE
YOUR LAST ATTACK
DIDN'T WORK!

00:10:51.342 --> 00:10:53.145
SO I'M STILL
IN DA GAME!

00:10:53.145 --> 00:10:56.018
Mai:
FOR NOW, MAYBE!

00:10:56.018 --> 00:10:57.354
THAT'S COOL.

00:10:57.354 --> 00:10:59.625
AT LEAST JOEY
BOUGHT HIMSELF
A LITTLE TIME.

00:10:59.625 --> 00:11:02.564
YES BUT IT DID COME
WITH A PRICE, TEA.

00:11:02.564 --> 00:11:04.033
IMPRESSIVE.

00:11:04.033 --> 00:11:09.277
BUT YOUR LITTLE MANEUVER
HELPED ME OUT, TOO.

00:11:09.277 --> 00:11:11.347
YEAH...I KNOW...

00:11:11.347 --> 00:11:13.618
NOW YOU GET TO PUT
THE TWO CARDS YOU PICKED

00:11:13.618 --> 00:11:18.494
AT THE TOP OF YOUR DECK.

00:11:18.494 --> 00:11:19.729
OH NO!

00:11:19.729 --> 00:11:22.569
NOW SHE CAN USE
THOSE TWO CARDS AGAIN!

00:11:22.569 --> 00:11:25.206
HARPIE LADY
PHOENIX FORMATION...

00:11:25.206 --> 00:11:27.311
AND HARPIE SPARROW
FORMATION.

00:11:27.311 --> 00:11:31.319
THOSE ARE TWO OF MAI'S
MOST POWERFUL CARDS!

00:11:31.319 --> 00:11:33.323
YOU MAY HAVE STOPPED
MY ATTACK

00:11:33.323 --> 00:11:35.293
BUT MY TURN'S NOT OVER.

00:11:35.293 --> 00:11:41.004
NEXT I'LL MOVE ONE
OF MY HARPIE LADIES
TO MY REAR DEFENSE.

00:11:41.004 --> 00:11:42.206
AND THEN...

00:11:42.206 --> 00:11:43.977
I'LL PLACE
TWO CARDS FACEDOWN

00:11:43.977 --> 00:11:47.116
AND END MY TURN!

00:11:47.116 --> 00:11:50.389
I'VE GOT
ONE MORE SHOT
TA DO DIS...

00:11:50.389 --> 00:11:52.526
BUT I'M ALL OUT
OF IDEAS!

00:11:57.834 --> 00:11:59.771
DIS DUEL'S
NOT OVA YET

00:11:59.771 --> 00:12:01.307
AND IT'S MY MOVE!

00:12:01.307 --> 00:12:03.444
I JUST NEED
DA RIGHT CARD!

00:12:05.817 --> 00:12:08.321
I PLACE ONE CARD
FACEDOWN.

00:12:08.321 --> 00:12:11.092
THEN I'LL SUMMON
A MONSTA FACEDOWN.

00:12:11.092 --> 00:12:12.596
AND LAST
BUT NOT LEAST,

00:12:12.596 --> 00:12:16.838
I'LL SWITCH MY FIEND
TO DEFENSE MODE.

00:12:16.838 --> 00:12:22.515
THIS ONE'S LOCKED TOO!

00:12:22.515 --> 00:12:25.688
COME ON!

00:12:25.688 --> 00:12:27.692
I DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME!

00:12:27.692 --> 00:12:30.430
I HAFTA SAY
YOU SEEM PRETTY CALM...

00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:32.734
FOR SOMEONE ABOUT TO LOSE
THEIR SOUL, THAT IS.

00:12:32.734 --> 00:12:34.438
YEAH WELL
I BEEN INVOLVED IN

00:12:34.438 --> 00:12:36.508
SOME PRETTY INSANE
DUELS IN MY DAY

00:12:36.508 --> 00:12:39.280
AND I LEARNED A REAL
IMPORTANT LESSON
ABOUT DIS GAME.

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:41.685
KEEP FIGHTIN' TILL
THE LAST POINT IS GONE!

00:12:41.685 --> 00:12:43.622
AND LAST I CHECKED

00:12:43.622 --> 00:12:46.160
I STILL HAD A HANDFUL
OF LIFE POINTS LEFT.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.164
SO GIMME YOUR BEST SHOT!

00:12:48.164 --> 00:12:50.535
WITH PLEASURE! NOW!

00:12:50.535 --> 00:12:52.706
YOU ACTIVATED MY TRAP!

00:12:52.706 --> 00:12:54.676
DROP OFF!

00:12:54.676 --> 00:12:56.680
SO DROP YOUR CARD!

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:58.550
I DON'T THINK SO!

00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:00.721
'CAUSE I HAVE
A FACEDOWN CARD TOO!

00:13:00.721 --> 00:13:03.159
TRAP JAMMER!

00:13:03.159 --> 00:13:05.865
IT CANCELS OUT
YOUR TRAP CARD

00:13:05.865 --> 00:13:08.703
SO IF YOU DON'T MIND
I'D LIKE TO CONTINUE
MY MOVE.

00:13:08.703 --> 00:13:11.409
SORRY BUT I'M ALWAYS
ONE STEP AHEAD.

00:13:11.409 --> 00:13:12.611
AW MAN!

00:13:12.611 --> 00:13:15.182
OH WELL...MOVIN' ON.

00:13:15.182 --> 00:13:18.923
THIS SHOULD BE A FUN WAY
TO END THINGS...

00:13:18.923 --> 00:13:20.626
BUT NOT JUST YET.

00:13:20.626 --> 00:13:22.129
HER TOP CARD.

00:13:22.129 --> 00:13:24.600
IT'S EITHER PHOENIX
OR SPARROW FORMATION.

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:26.905
GO HARPIES PET DRAGON!

00:13:26.905 --> 00:13:28.942
ATTACK HIS FIEND NOW!

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:37.959
AND NEXT...

00:13:37.959 --> 00:13:41.199
HARPIE LADY, ATTACK
HIS FACEDOWN MONSTER!

00:13:45.374 --> 00:13:47.311
WHO'S DA MAN!

00:13:47.311 --> 00:13:49.682
YOU JUST DESTROYED
MY FIBER JAR,

00:13:49.682 --> 00:13:51.118
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY

00:13:51.118 --> 00:13:53.355
ACTIVATED ITS
SPECIAL ABILITY!!

00:13:53.355 --> 00:13:56.863
SO...WE HAFTA DUMP
ALL OUR CARDS
IN ONE BIG PILE...

00:13:56.863 --> 00:13:58.866
AND THEN WE EACH PICK 5...

00:13:58.866 --> 00:14:01.338
I KNOW HOW THE CARD WORKS.

00:14:01.338 --> 00:14:03.442
NOT LIKE IT REALLY
MATTERS NOW...

00:14:03.442 --> 00:14:06.247
MY TRAP CANCELS IT OUT!

00:14:06.247 --> 00:14:11.424
WHAT!?
WHAT'S GOIN' ON!?

00:14:11.424 --> 00:14:14.263
THE POWER OF MY HARPIE'S
FEATHER STORM

00:14:14.263 --> 00:14:17.502
IS ABLE TO DEACTIVATE
YOUR MONSTERS
SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:14:20.942 --> 00:14:22.445
OH NO!

00:14:22.445 --> 00:14:25.317
IT LOOKS LIKE
JOEY'S FRESH OUT OF
MONSTERS AGAIN TEA!

00:14:25.317 --> 00:14:26.519
HANG IN THERE...

00:14:26.519 --> 00:14:28.390
YOUR LIFE POINTS
ARE EXPOSED!

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:31.562
BUT LUCKY FOR YOU
I HAFTA END MY TURN.

00:14:31.562 --> 00:14:34.634
LET'S SEE WHAT KIND
OF DESPERATE MOVE
YOU'VE GOT NOW.

00:14:34.634 --> 00:14:39.043
DESPERATE!? HA!

00:14:39.043 --> 00:14:41.147
I PLACE
ONE MONSTA FACEDOWN

00:14:41.147 --> 00:14:42.483
AND DAT'S ALL!

00:14:42.483 --> 00:14:46.557
TOLD YA
YOU WERE DESPERATE.

00:14:46.557 --> 00:14:50.165
IT'S TIME
FOR MAI TO DELIVER
THE FINISHING TOUCH.

00:14:50.165 --> 00:14:52.268
I'M GONNA MISS SEEING
WHEELER SQUIRM.

00:14:52.268 --> 00:14:53.605
BUT I'LL MOVE ON..

00:14:53.605 --> 00:14:58.180
Mai:
NICE KNOWIN' YA, HON.

00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:01.019
ONLY ONE MONSTER
LEFT TO CRUSH.

00:15:01.019 --> 00:15:05.193
AND I'M GONNA SEND
THIS POOR SAP OUT
WITH A BANG.

00:15:05.193 --> 00:15:09.067
ONCE I ACTIVATE
MY HARPIE LADY
PHOENIX FORMATION CARD,

00:15:09.067 --> 00:15:11.739
HIS PUNY FACEDOWN
MONSTER'S A GONER.

00:15:11.739 --> 00:15:14.645
AND THANKS TO
ITS SECONDARY POWER,

00:15:14.645 --> 00:15:17.884
I'LL BE WIPING OUT
WHAT'S LEFT OF HIS
LIFE POINTS, TOO.

00:15:17.884 --> 00:15:20.757
IT'S ALL OVER FOR YOU
WHEELER!

00:15:20.757 --> 00:15:24.931
I ACTIVATE MY HARPIE LADY
PHOENIX FORMATION!

00:15:24.931 --> 00:15:27.836
AND IN CASE
YOU'RE TOO STUNNED
TO FIGURE THIS OUT...

00:15:27.836 --> 00:15:30.442
IT MEANS I WIN THE DUEL!

00:15:47.341 --> 00:15:48.409
GOOD-BYE!

00:15:48.409 --> 00:15:50.714
Tristan:
THIS IS IT!

00:15:53.386 --> 00:15:55.890
IT DIDN'T WORK!?

00:15:58.863 --> 00:16:02.003
NO! WHAT WAS THAT!?

00:16:02.003 --> 00:16:06.611
DAT...WAS MY BUDDY
NEKO MANE KING!

00:16:06.611 --> 00:16:08.615
HE HAS
ZERO ATTACK POINTS!

00:16:08.615 --> 00:16:10.819
SO I DIDN'T LOSE
ANY LIFE POINTS,

00:16:10.819 --> 00:16:12.689
WHICH MEANS
YOU JUST WASTED
YOUR BEST CARD!

00:16:12.689 --> 00:16:13.924
OH WELL.

00:16:13.924 --> 00:16:15.895
PRETTY COOL, HUH?

00:16:17.432 --> 00:16:18.768
AND THERE'S MORE!

00:16:18.768 --> 00:16:21.439
NEKO MANE KING HAS
A SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:16:21.439 --> 00:16:24.111
SINCE YOU DESTROYED IT
USING A MAGIC CARD

00:16:24.111 --> 00:16:26.749
YOUR TURN AUTOMATICALLY
COMES TO AN END!

00:16:26.749 --> 00:16:28.953
WHICH PUTS ME
IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT!!

00:16:30.457 --> 00:16:32.026
THAT WAS CLOSE.

00:16:32.026 --> 00:16:34.531
I DON'T KNOW
HOW MUCH MORE OF
THIS I CAN TAKE.

00:16:34.531 --> 00:16:37.236
THE GUY'S
GOT MORE LIVES
THAN MY CAT!

00:16:37.236 --> 00:16:39.808
HE JUST KEEPS STALLING
FOR MORE TIME.

00:16:39.808 --> 00:16:42.714
BUT HOW MUCH LONGER
CAN HE KEEP THIS UP?

00:16:42.714 --> 00:16:43.949
WHAT'S THE DEAL?!

00:16:43.949 --> 00:16:46.487
IS YOUR STRATEGY
TO DRAG THIS OUT FOREVER

00:16:46.487 --> 00:16:48.424
SO I FORFEIT FROM BOREDOM?!

00:16:48.424 --> 00:16:51.397
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST WORRY ABOUT
YOUR OWN STRATEGY

00:16:51.397 --> 00:16:54.370
AND LET ME WORRY
ABOUT MINE.

00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:57.041
THE FACT IS,
MAI'S GOT A POINT.

00:16:57.041 --> 00:16:58.543
I'M JUST PUTTIN'
THINGS OFF

00:16:58.543 --> 00:17:00.047
FOR AS LONG
AS I CAN,,

00:17:00.047 --> 00:17:02.485
UNTIL I FIGURE A WAY
OUTTA DIS MESS.

00:17:02.485 --> 00:17:04.389
AND QUITTIN'S
NOT AN OPTION.

00:17:04.389 --> 00:17:07.995
DAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
DOSE BIKER CREEPS
WANT ME TA DO.

00:17:07.995 --> 00:17:09.732
BUT I GOTTA

00:17:09.732 --> 00:17:11.602
AND FIND OUT
WHAT DA BRUTE SQUAD
UP THERE

00:17:11.602 --> 00:17:13.472
IS REALLY AFTER!

00:17:13.472 --> 00:17:16.178
BUT IT'S GONNA TAKE
SOME KINDA MIRACLE!

00:17:16.178 --> 00:17:19.083
I KNOW THERE'S
