00:09:18.398 --> 00:09:19.467
[GASPS]

00:09:19.467 --> 00:09:20.702
IS THAT REALLY YOU?

00:09:20.702 --> 00:09:22.438
YUGI!

00:09:22.438 --> 00:09:24.108
HEY,
IT'S HIM!

00:09:24.108 --> 00:09:27.981
I'VE FOUND YOU!

00:09:27.981 --> 00:09:29.183
HMM?

00:09:29.183 --> 00:09:32.022
YOU CAME ALL THIS WAY
JUST TO SEE ME?

00:09:32.022 --> 00:09:33.524
OF COURSE.

00:09:33.524 --> 00:09:35.428
I WANTED TO SAY
HOW SORRY I AM.

00:09:35.428 --> 00:09:36.697
I'M SORRY, TOO.

00:09:36.697 --> 00:09:38.500
I WISH THIS WHOLE
THING NEVER HAPPENED.

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:40.036
IT'S MY FAULT.

00:09:40.036 --> 00:09:42.073
I SURRENDERED TO
MY INNER DARKNESS.

00:09:42.073 --> 00:09:44.243
I ALLOWED MY ANGER
TO TAKE OVER,

00:09:44.243 --> 00:09:46.247
AND YOU PAID THE PRICE.

00:09:46.247 --> 00:09:47.582
NOW THAT YOU'RE GONE,

00:09:47.582 --> 00:09:49.519
THE DARKNESS IS
STARTING TO GROW.

00:09:49.519 --> 00:09:51.723
WITHOUT YOUR LIGHT
TO KEEP ME PURE...

00:09:51.723 --> 00:09:53.926
I'M BECOMING EVIL, YUGI!

00:09:53.926 --> 00:09:55.430
I'M BEGINNING TO BELIEVE

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:58.033
THAT WHAT RAFAEL SAID
ABOUT ME IS TRUE.

00:09:58.033 --> 00:10:01.206
PERHAPS I WAS A WICKED PHARAOH!

00:10:01.206 --> 00:10:02.809
I HEARD ABOUT YOU...

00:10:02.809 --> 00:10:05.013
HOW YOU RULED
AS AN EVIL KING.

00:10:05.013 --> 00:10:06.349
THAT'S RIGHT, PHARAOH.

00:10:06.349 --> 00:10:09.020
YOU USED THE POWER
OF THE SHADOW REALM

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:12.058
TO DESTROY EGYPT!

00:10:12.058 --> 00:10:13.327
WHAT IF I AM THE ONE

00:10:13.327 --> 00:10:15.898
RESPONSIBLE FOR
THE DESTRUCTION OF EGYPT?

00:10:15.898 --> 00:10:18.235
IF I'M CAPABLE OF
SUCH HORRIFIC BEHAVIOR,

00:10:18.235 --> 00:10:20.306
THEN IT'S MY SOUL THAT
SHOULD BE LOCKED AWAY!

00:10:20.306 --> 00:10:22.309
WELL, WHAT GOOD
IS THAT NOW!?

00:10:22.309 --> 00:10:23.912
I'M THE ONE WHO'S BEEN
LOCKED AWAY FOREVER,

00:10:23.912 --> 00:10:24.913
NOT YOU!

00:10:24.913 --> 00:10:26.684
I'M SORRY.

00:10:26.684 --> 00:10:29.889
WELL, THE LAST
THING I NEED IS
YOUR PITY, PHARAOH!

00:10:29.889 --> 00:10:30.958
IF YOU'RE REALLY EVIL,

00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.594
THERE'S ONLY
ONE THING TO DO.

00:10:32.594 --> 00:10:36.701
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

00:10:36.701 --> 00:10:38.805
YOU SAID IT YOURSELF,
DIDN'T YOU?

00:10:38.805 --> 00:10:41.743
YOUR SPIRIT SHOULD BE
LOCKED AWAY WITH MINE!

00:10:41.743 --> 00:10:43.112
AND I'M GONNA DO IT!

00:10:43.112 --> 00:10:44.314
WAIT!

00:10:44.314 --> 00:10:45.483
YOU
MISUNDERSTOOD ME!

00:10:45.483 --> 00:10:47.988
OH, SO NOW YOU'RE TAKING
BACK WHAT YOU SAID!?

00:10:47.988 --> 00:10:49.590
MAKE UP YOUR MIND!

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:52.195
YOU DON'T DESERVE TO BE
A PART OF THIS WORLD!

00:10:52.195 --> 00:10:53.697
YUGI.

00:10:53.697 --> 00:10:55.200
IT'S ABOUT
TIME YOU STARTED

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.871
TAKING SOME RESPONSIBILITY
FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE!

00:10:57.871 --> 00:10:59.908
THERE'S ONLY ONE
THING LEFT TO DO,

00:10:59.908 --> 00:11:01.177
AND YOU KNOW IT!

00:11:01.177 --> 00:11:02.679
YOU NEED TO BE
A MAN FOR ONCE

00:11:02.679 --> 00:11:04.048
AND FACE ME
IN A DUEL NOW!

00:11:04.048 --> 00:11:05.985
NO. PLEASE--

00:11:05.985 --> 00:11:07.254
TOO LATE!

00:11:07.254 --> 00:11:09.224
IT'S TIME
FOR YOU TO PAY!

00:11:09.224 --> 00:11:13.833
IF YOU'RE REALLY SORRY,
THEN YOU'LL DO THIS!

00:11:13.833 --> 00:11:15.502
IT'S TIME TO DUEL!

00:11:20.241 --> 00:11:21.343
Tea: WAIT!

00:11:21.343 --> 00:11:22.912
SO, HE'S GONNA
DUEL HIMSELF?

00:11:22.912 --> 00:11:24.850
BUT WHY?

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:26.419
Ironheart:
THIS IS THE ONLY WAY.

00:11:26.419 --> 00:11:27.588
HUH?

00:11:27.588 --> 00:11:29.324
Chris: THAT'S WHY WE
TOOK YOU GUYS HERE,

00:11:29.324 --> 00:11:32.129
SO THE PHARAOH CAN
FACE HIS OTHER HALF.

00:11:32.129 --> 00:11:33.931
HE HAS TO DEAL
WITH WHAT HE DID

00:11:33.931 --> 00:11:35.234
SO HE CAN PUT IT
ALL BEHIND HIM

00:11:35.234 --> 00:11:36.904
AND FINALLY MOVE ON!

00:11:36.904 --> 00:11:39.509
HOW DO YOU KNOW
ALL THIS STUFF?

00:11:39.509 --> 00:11:41.578
WE'VE ALWAYS KNOWN THIS.

00:11:41.578 --> 00:11:43.516
WE WERE TAUGHT THAT
A WARRIOR WOULD COME

00:11:43.516 --> 00:11:44.851
TO SAVE OUR WORLD.

00:11:44.851 --> 00:11:46.754
AND AS SOON AS WE
FOUND YOU GUYS,

00:11:46.754 --> 00:11:48.223
WE KNEW THAT
HE WAS THE ONE.

00:11:48.223 --> 00:11:50.695
SO, WHAT'S HE
SUPPOSED TO DO NOW?

00:11:50.695 --> 00:11:53.366
HIS FIRST STEP IS TO
FACE HIS INNER FEARS

00:11:53.366 --> 00:11:56.538
AND CONQUER THE DARKNESS
THAT LURKS WITHIN HIS HEART.

00:11:56.538 --> 00:11:58.341
BUT IF HE LOSES THIS BATTLE,

00:11:58.341 --> 00:12:02.047
THE PHARAOH'S SPIRIT
WILL REMAIN HERE FOREVER.

00:12:06.923 --> 00:12:07.925
ALL RIGHT...

00:12:07.925 --> 00:12:09.327
I'LL START THINGS OFF...

00:12:09.327 --> 00:12:14.068
BY SUMMONING ONE MONSTER
FACEDOWN ON THE FIELD!

00:12:14.068 --> 00:12:16.072
NOW, LET'S SEE
WHAT YOU'VE GOT--

00:12:16.072 --> 00:12:17.374
UNLESS YOU'RE
TOO SCARED.

00:12:17.374 --> 00:12:19.578
VERY WELL...

00:12:19.578 --> 00:12:20.847
IF I MUST!

00:12:20.847 --> 00:12:22.751
I SUMMON GAZELLE,

00:12:22.751 --> 00:12:25.589
THE KING OF
MYTHICAL BEASTS!

00:12:25.589 --> 00:12:26.624
[ROARS]

00:12:26.624 --> 00:12:29.395
NOW, GAZELLE, ATTACK
HIS FACEDOWN CARD!

00:12:29.395 --> 00:12:32.868
[ROARS]

00:12:32.868 --> 00:12:35.606
Yugi: MINE'S A GAZELLE, TOO!

00:12:35.606 --> 00:12:37.676
THEY PLAYED
THE SAME CARD!

00:12:37.676 --> 00:12:39.579
Ironheart:
THEIR HANDS ARE IDENTICAL.

00:12:39.579 --> 00:12:41.082
YUGI, WAIT.

00:12:41.082 --> 00:12:43.686
WE'RE HOLDING THE SAME
CARDS, AREN'T WE?

00:12:43.686 --> 00:12:45.657
LET'S FIND OUT!

00:12:45.657 --> 00:12:49.764
I'LL SUMMON ANOTHER
CARD FACEDOWN!

00:12:49.764 --> 00:12:51.834
DO THESE LOOK
FAMILIAR?!

00:12:51.834 --> 00:12:54.205
POLYMERIZATION
AND BERFOMET!

00:12:54.205 --> 00:12:56.743
NOW I CAN FUSE MY
TWO MONSTERS TOGETHER

00:12:56.743 --> 00:12:58.078
TO FORM CHIMERA...

00:12:58.078 --> 00:13:00.248
THE FLYING MYTHICAL BEAST.

00:13:00.248 --> 00:13:03.855
[SNARLS]

00:13:03.855 --> 00:13:08.964
NEXT, I'LL PLAY ALPHA,
THE MAGNET WARRIOR!

00:13:08.964 --> 00:13:12.002
NOW, ATTACK HIS
FACEDOWN MONSTER!

00:13:12.002 --> 00:13:14.273
[SHRIEKS]

00:13:14.273 --> 00:13:16.778
YOUR DEFENSE IS GONE!

00:13:16.778 --> 00:13:19.983
CHIMERA, ATTACK HIS
LIFE POINTS DIRECTLY!

00:13:19.983 --> 00:13:23.923
OH!

00:13:23.923 --> 00:13:25.626
[THINKING]
THAT'S STRANGE.

00:13:25.626 --> 00:13:27.330
IF WE DO HAVE
THE SAME HAND,

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:30.368
THEN WHY DIDN'T YUGI
PLAY MONSTER REBORN?

00:13:30.368 --> 00:13:32.104
HE COULD HAVE USED IT
TO BRING BACK

00:13:32.104 --> 00:13:34.342
HIS GAZELLE
AND BLOCK MY ATTACK!

00:13:34.342 --> 00:13:36.678
FOR SOME REASON,
HE'S HOLDING BACK.

00:13:36.678 --> 00:13:40.151
COULD YUGI BE TRYING TO
LOSE THE DUEL ON PURPOSE,

00:13:40.151 --> 00:13:41.888
OR IS HE TRYING
TO THROW ME OFF

00:13:41.888 --> 00:13:45.327
WITH A STRATEGY
HE'S NEVER USED BEFORE?

00:13:45.327 --> 00:13:47.364
WHEN YOU DESTROYED
MY SANGAN,

00:13:47.364 --> 00:13:49.935
YOU ACTIVATED ITS
SPECIAL ABILITY...

00:13:49.935 --> 00:13:53.942
LETTING ME MOVE A MONSTER
FROM MY DECK TO MY HAND.

00:13:53.942 --> 00:13:55.646
YES, GOOD MOVE.

00:13:55.646 --> 00:13:57.515
I DON'T NEED
YOUR SUPPORT!

00:13:57.515 --> 00:14:00.887
I PLACE THIS FACEDOWN.

00:14:00.887 --> 00:14:02.624
THEN I'LL PLAY THIS--

00:14:02.624 --> 00:14:04.127
CARD DESTRUCTION!

00:14:04.127 --> 00:14:06.030
BUT WHY!?

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:07.632
SO I CAN START OVER

00:14:07.632 --> 00:14:09.001
AND OUR HANDS
WILL BE DIFFERENT!

00:14:09.001 --> 00:14:10.805
DISAPPOINTED!?

00:14:10.805 --> 00:14:13.008
NOW YOU CAN'T
CHEAT ANYMORE!

00:14:13.008 --> 00:14:14.946
WHY ARE YOU ACTING
LIKE THIS!?

00:14:14.946 --> 00:14:17.283
I'M JUST
A REFLECTION OF YOU!

00:14:17.283 --> 00:14:19.119
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YUGI!?

00:14:19.119 --> 00:14:20.855
YOU DON'T GET IT,
DO YOU?

00:14:20.855 --> 00:14:22.893
YOU AND I ARE
EXACTLY THE SAME.

00:14:22.893 --> 00:14:25.564
SO, THE DARKNESS
THAT'S IN YOUR HEART...

00:14:25.564 --> 00:14:27.500
IS ALSO INSIDE MY HEART.

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:30.372
YUGI, I WISH I
COULD TAKE IT BACK.

00:14:30.372 --> 00:14:31.741
TOO LATE!

00:14:31.741 --> 00:14:34.346
YOU'VE ALREADY SHOWN ME
WHO YOU REALLY ARE--

00:14:34.346 --> 00:14:37.384
AN EVIL PHARAOH WHO CARES
ONLY ABOUT HIMSELF!

00:14:37.384 --> 00:14:39.355
FACE THE FACTS!

00:14:39.355 --> 00:14:41.391
YOU DIDN'T CARE
WHAT HAPPENED TO ME

00:14:41.391 --> 00:14:43.295
SO LONG AS YOU HAD POWER!

00:14:43.295 --> 00:14:44.764
NOW IT'S MY TURN!

00:14:44.764 --> 00:14:46.100
YUGI, WAIT!

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:48.270
ARE YOU HOLDING THE CARD
I THINK YOU ARE!?

00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:50.841
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE
STARTING TO CATCH ON...

00:14:50.841 --> 00:14:53.612
AREN'T YOU, YOUR HIGHNESS?

00:14:53.612 --> 00:14:55.449
THIS DUEL IS
A CHANCE FOR YOU

00:14:55.449 --> 00:14:57.754
TO LOOK AT YOURSELF
FROM THE OUTSIDE.

00:14:57.754 --> 00:15:00.759
AND THERE'S ONLY ONE CARD
THAT CAN MAKE THAT HAPPEN...

00:15:00.759 --> 00:15:02.595
THE SEAL OF ORICHALCOS!

00:15:02.595 --> 00:15:05.600
HUH?!
YUGI, NO!

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:06.735
[GASPS]

00:15:19.955 --> 00:15:23.160
NOW IT'S PAYBACK TIME
FOR TAKING MY SOUL!

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.431
THIS IS A MISTAKE!

00:15:25.431 --> 00:15:26.500
COME ON!

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:28.036
JUST REPLACE YOUR
HAND ALREADY!

00:15:28.036 --> 00:15:29.571
I PLAYED CARD
DESTRUCTION!

00:15:29.571 --> 00:15:30.640
[GROWLS]

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:33.578
OR DON'T YOU REMEMBER!?

00:15:33.578 --> 00:15:35.515
AND NOW,
FOR MY NEXT MOVE:

00:15:35.515 --> 00:15:38.654
I ACTIVATE
MONSTER REBORN!

00:15:38.654 --> 00:15:41.559
AND I'LL USE IT
TO BRING BACK

00:15:41.559 --> 00:15:45.132
MY DARK MAGICIAN GIRL!

00:15:45.132 --> 00:15:51.676
THEN I'LL SUMMON MY
OBNOXIOUS CELTIC GUARDIAN!

00:15:51.676 --> 00:15:53.246
PHARAOH...

00:15:53.246 --> 00:15:54.348
YOU KNOW WHAT
HAPPENS NEXT!

00:15:54.348 --> 00:15:55.850
STOP THIS NOW!

00:15:55.850 --> 00:16:01.894
NOW THE ORICHALCOS
SERVES MY MONSTERS!

00:16:01.894 --> 00:16:04.899
[GROWLS]

00:16:04.899 --> 00:16:07.404
[GROWLS]

00:16:07.404 --> 00:16:09.207
NOW, MY
CELTIC GUARDIAN,

00:16:09.207 --> 00:16:14.951
DESTROY HIS
MAGNET WARRIOR!

00:16:14.951 --> 00:16:17.121
YOUR TURN,
DARK MAGICIAN GIRL...

00:16:17.121 --> 00:16:20.660
INCINERATE HIS

00:16:25.669 --> 00:16:27.906
I'LL USE CHIMERA'S
SPECIAL ABILITY ...

TO SUMMON BERFOMET
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:33.649
BIG DEAL!

00:16:33.649 --> 00:16:34.951
WHAT ELSE HAVE
YOU GOT!?

00:16:34.951 --> 00:16:38.591
I'VE GOT THIS...

00:16:38.591 --> 00:16:41.964
THE MIGHTY BIG SHIELD
GARDNA IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:16:41.964 --> 00:16:43.801
[THINKING]
THIS SHOULD PROTECT
MY LIFE POINTS

00:16:43.801 --> 00:16:46.238
FROM DARK MAGICIAN
GIRL'S ATTACK.

00:16:46.238 --> 00:16:48.208
THAT'S ALL!?

00:16:48.208 --> 00:16:54.186
I PLAY QUEEN'S KNIGHT
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:16:54.186 --> 00:16:55.888
AND TO BOOST
MY FIRE POWER,

00:16:55.888 --> 00:16:58.660
I'LL ACTIVATE
MAGIC FORMULA!

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:04.069
IT RAISES DARK
MAGICIAN GIRL'S
ATTACK POINTS BY 500!

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:06.507
3,000 ATTACK POINTS!?

00:17:06.507 --> 00:17:08.743
QUEEN'S KNIGHT, ATTACK!

00:17:08.743 --> 00:17:13.185
[SCREAMING]

00:17:13.185 --> 00:17:16.090
AND NOW FOR MY
DARK MAGICIAN GIRL!

00:17:16.090 --> 00:17:18.495
TAKE OUT HIS
BIG SHIELD GARDNA!

00:17:18.495 --> 00:17:21.199
[GRUNTING]

00:17:21.199 --> 00:17:23.202
BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE!

00:17:23.202 --> 00:17:25.240
GO, CELTIC GUARDIAN!

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:30.849
[GRUNTING]

00:17:30.849 --> 00:17:33.587
IT WON'T BE LONG
NOW, PHARAOH!

00:17:33.587 --> 00:17:36.592
YUGI, DON'T DO THIS!

00:17:36.592 --> 00:17:38.128
IT HURTS,
DOESN'T IT?

00:17:38.128 --> 00:17:39.764
AND IT ONLY
GETS WORSE.

00:17:39.764 --> 00:17:42.035
SOON YOU'LL BE
LOCKED AWAY FOREVER--

00:17:42.035 --> 00:17:44.973
WHERE YOU BELONG!

00:17:44.973 --> 00:17:47.077
I'LL PLACE ONE
CARD FACEDOWN

00:17:47.077 --> 00:17:51.351
AND SUMMON GIANT SOLDIER
OF STONE IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:17:51.351 --> 00:17:57.729
NEXT, I ACTIVATE MY SWORDS
OF REVEALING LIGHT!

00:17:57.729 --> 00:17:59.465
[THINKING]
THIS GIVES ME 3 TURNS

00:17:59.465 --> 00:18:01.703
TO TALK SOME
SENSE INTO YUGI.

00:18:01.703 --> 00:18:03.739
YOUR SWORDS
MEAN NOTHING!

00:18:03.739 --> 00:18:06.644
I HAVE A CARD THAT CAN
BLAST RIGHT THROUGH THEM!

00:18:06.644 --> 00:18:08.381
YOU SHOULD'VE KNOWN THAT!

00:18:08.381 --> 00:18:11.053
IT'S A CARD YOU'VE
PLAYED BEFORE.

00:18:11.053 --> 00:18:16.295
NOW I SACRIFICE MY GUARDIAN
TO SUMMON CATAPULT TURTLE!

00:18:18.098 --> 00:18:20.201
THIS IS WHAT
I DID LAST TIME!

00:18:20.201 --> 00:18:21.403
EXACTLY!

00:18:21.403 --> 00:18:22.806
SO IT'S TIME FOR YOU

00:18:22.806 --> 00:18:26.012
TO EXPERIENCE
THE CONSEQUENCES
OF YOUR OWN EVIL!

00:18:26.012 --> 00:18:28.182
NOW, YOU'LL NEVER
DUEL AGAIN!

00:18:28.182 --> 00:18:29.684
IT'S ALL OVER!

00:18:29.684 --> 00:18:31.555
ALL RIGHT,
QUEEN'S KNIGHT,

00:18:31.555 --> 00:18:36.464
I SACRIFICE YOU!

00:18:36.464 --> 00:18:38.667
YUGI, NO!

00:18:38.667 --> 00:18:40.303
DARK MAGICIAN GIRL...

00:18:40.303 --> 00:18:41.305
YOUR TURN!

00:18:41.305 --> 00:18:42.807
HUH?

00:18:42.807 --> 00:18:45.178
GO ON!

00:18:45.178 --> 00:18:47.549
LAUNCH CATAPULT TURTLE!

00:18:47.549 --> 00:18:54.495
LAUNCH CATAPULT TURTLE!

00:18:54.495 --> 00:18:56.231
[GRUNTING]

00:18:56.231 --> 00:18:57.266
[SCREAMING]

00:18:57.266 --> 00:18:58.802
OH NO!

00:19:03.444 --> 00:19:04.913
ONE MORE ATTACK,

00:19:04.913 --> 00:19:07.116
AND YOU'LL BECOME
A PRISONER OF
THE ORICHALCOS--

00:19:07.116 --> 00:19:08.118
JUST LIKE ME!

00:19:08.118 --> 00:19:09.487
OH, NO.

00:19:09.487 --> 00:19:11.090
I CAN'T LOSE.

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:12.159
IF I DO...

00:19:12.159 --> 00:19:13.828
THEN I CAN'T
SET YOU FREE

00:19:13.828 --> 00:19:15.565
AND TWO WORLDS
WILL CRUMBLE!

00:19:15.565 --> 00:19:16.733
SO WHAT!?

00:19:16.733 --> 00:19:18.503
YOU'RE EVIL, REMEMBER!

00:19:18.503 --> 00:19:19.605
LAST TIME...

00:19:19.605 --> 00:19:23.545
YOU DIDN'T CARE
WHO SUFFERED!

00:19:23.545 --> 00:19:25.849
YUGI, I'M BEGGING YOU,

00:19:25.849 --> 00:19:27.452
PLEASE DON'T GO
THROUGH WITH THIS!

00:19:27.452 --> 00:19:28.987
TOO LATE.

00:19:28.987 --> 00:19:31.125
ATTACK!

00:19:31.125 --> 00:19:33.096
YUGI, NO!

00:19:33.096 --> 00:19:34.998
I WON'T LET
YOU DO THIS!

00:19:34.998 --> 00:19:37.001
[SCREAMING]

00:19:37.001 --> 00:19:38.872
I ACTIVATE
THE TRAP CARD...

00:19:38.872 --> 00:19:43.813
DIVINE WIND!

00:19:43.813 --> 00:19:45.784
HE DID IT!

00:19:45.784 --> 00:19:47.920
HE WAS ABLE TO
REVERSE MY ATTACK

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:51.327
AND DOUBLE ITS STRENGTH
TO WIN THE DUEL!

00:19:51.327 --> 00:19:52.362
[SCREAMS]

00:19:52.362 --> 00:19:53.798
WHAT HAVE I DONE!?

00:19:53.798 --> 00:19:55.667
YUGI!

00:19:55.667 --> 00:19:56.736
[GROANING]

00:19:56.736 --> 00:20:00.576
IS HE ALL RIGHT?

00:20:00.576 --> 00:20:03.047
YUGI!

00:20:03.047 --> 00:20:04.416
COME ON!

00:20:04.416 --> 00:20:05.952
SPEAK TO ME,
PLEASE!

00:20:05.952 --> 00:20:08.957
YOU PASSED THE TEST, PAL.

00:20:08.957 --> 00:20:10.961
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

00:20:10.961 --> 00:20:13.833
DID YOU PLAN
THIS ALL ALONG?

00:20:13.833 --> 00:20:15.736
IT WAS THE ONLY WAY.

00:20:15.736 --> 00:20:17.272
BY DEFEATING ME,

00:20:17.272 --> 00:20:18.808
YOU WERE ABLE TO
DEFEAT THE DARKNESS

00:20:18.808 --> 00:20:20.010
THAT WAS INSIDE
YOUR HEART.

00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:21.546
IT WASN'T EASY,

00:20:21.546 --> 00:20:25.019
BUT YOU DID WHAT WAS BEST
FOR ME AND FOR MANKIND.

00:20:25.019 --> 00:20:28.400
YOU ACTED LIKE
A TRUE HERO.

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:30.669
BUT NOW WHAT?

00:20:30.669 --> 00:20:32.771
DON'T GIVE UP THIS FIGHT.

00:20:32.771 --> 00:20:33.972
REMEMBER...

00:20:33.972 --> 00:20:39.277
I'M ALWAYS WITH YOU.

00:20:39.277 --> 00:20:42.013
I'LL SAVE YOU...

00:20:42.013 --> 00:20:44.182
NO MATTER WHAT IT TAKES.
