00:11:16.522 --> 00:11:18.459
THERE'S NOTHING
HE CAN DO!

00:11:18.459 --> 00:11:20.296
MAI BACKED JOEY
INTO A CORNER

00:11:20.296 --> 00:11:22.066
AND NOW
HE'S STUCK THERE!

00:11:22.066 --> 00:11:24.470
TRISTAN'S GOT A POINT.

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:26.808
IF JOEY DOESN'T DO
SOMETHING QUICK

00:11:26.808 --> 00:11:28.411
MAI'S GONNA WIN
THE DUEL!

00:11:28.411 --> 00:11:29.881

SO MY PANTHER

00:12:02.642 --> 00:12:04.880
