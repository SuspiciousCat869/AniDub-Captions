00:08:35.153 --> 00:08:37.190
Mikey: WHERE'S MOM??

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:39.361
SHE'S GONE.

00:08:39.361 --> 00:08:40.363
I KNOW.

00:08:40.363 --> 00:08:41.865
WHERE'D SHE GO?

00:08:41.865 --> 00:08:43.836
SHE WAS CAPTURED.

00:08:43.836 --> 00:08:46.774
OH, BUT I PROMISE
THAT WON'T HAPPEN
TO YOU,

00:08:46.774 --> 00:08:48.678
AND SOON
WE'LL FIND MOM.

00:08:48.678 --> 00:08:50.682
BUT UNTIL THEN...

00:08:50.682 --> 00:08:51.684
[EXPLOSION]

00:08:51.684 --> 00:08:53.554
IT'S THE TANKS!

00:08:53.554 --> 00:08:56.193
QUICK,
FOLLOW ME!

00:08:56.193 --> 00:08:57.929
Mikey: HELP!

00:08:57.929 --> 00:08:58.931
MIKEY?

00:08:58.931 --> 00:09:00.835
WHERE ARE YA, PAL?

00:09:00.835 --> 00:09:02.537
THEY TOOK HIM!

00:09:02.537 --> 00:09:04.642
THEY GOT MY BROTHER!

00:09:04.642 --> 00:09:06.712
MIKEY...

00:09:06.712 --> 00:09:09.050
SOON THE REAL DYNA-DUDE
WILL SHOW UP..

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:10.052
DON'T WORRY.

00:09:10.052 --> 00:09:13.024
HE'S GONNA BE HERE SOON.

00:09:13.024 --> 00:09:14.026
[SOBS]

00:09:14.026 --> 00:09:15.228
NOOOOO!

00:09:15.228 --> 00:09:21.373
MIKEY, COME BACK!

00:09:21.373 --> 00:09:23.143
Alister, voice-over:
SOON AFTER HE WAS TAKEN,

00:09:23.143 --> 00:09:25.814
I FOUND OUT WHO
WAS REALLY RESPONSIBLE.

00:09:25.814 --> 00:09:27.484
Man: WE COULDN'T
HAVE DONE THIS

00:09:27.484 --> 00:09:31.893
WITHOUT YOU,
MR. KAIBA.

00:09:31.893 --> 00:09:35.633
Alister, voice-over:
I WOULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING
TO GET MIKEY BACK.

00:09:35.633 --> 00:09:39.473
Male voice:
I CAN HELP YOU, ALISTER.

00:09:39.473 --> 00:09:44.082
I KNOW WHO TOOK YOUR FAMILY
AWAY FROM YOU, MY CHILD.

00:09:44.082 --> 00:09:46.152
AND IF YOU DO AS I SAY,

00:09:46.152 --> 00:09:48.523
YOU'LL SOON BE REUNITED
WITH THEM.

00:09:48.523 --> 00:09:50.427
I WILL?

00:09:50.427 --> 00:09:51.796
WHO ARE YOU?

00:09:51.796 --> 00:09:53.834
I'M A FRIEND--

00:09:53.834 --> 00:09:56.839
A FRIEND WHO WANTS
TO SEE JUSTICE SERVED

00:09:56.839 --> 00:09:58.876
BY HELPING
YOU DESTROY THE MAN

00:09:58.876 --> 00:10:00.680
WHO CREATED
THE VERY TANKS

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:02.516
YOUR ENEMIES USED
TO CAPTURE YOUR BROTHER.

00:10:02.516 --> 00:10:03.518
TELL ME.

00:10:03.518 --> 00:10:04.754
WHO IS IT?

00:10:04.754 --> 00:10:06.557
GOZABURO KAIBA.

00:10:06.557 --> 00:10:10.030
YOUR FATHER DID THIS TO ME.

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:12.101
NOW YOU RUN
HIS EVIL EMPIRE,

00:10:12.101 --> 00:10:15.641
SO IT'S YOUR FAULT, TOO.

00:10:15.641 --> 00:10:17.879
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

00:10:17.879 --> 00:10:20.683
IT'S TIME TO PAY
FOR YOUR FATHER'S CRIME...

00:10:20.683 --> 00:10:24.558
BY GIVING UP YOUR SOUL
TO FEED THE BEAST.

00:10:24.558 --> 00:10:26.795
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

00:10:26.795 --> 00:10:28.298
MY BROTHER'S INNOCENT!

00:10:28.298 --> 00:10:29.901
MOKUBA...

00:10:29.901 --> 00:10:32.372
OUR STEPFATHER
WAS A BIG JERK,

00:10:32.372 --> 00:10:34.342
BUT DON'T BLAME SETO
FOR THAT!

00:10:34.342 --> 00:10:36.847
HE KNEW THAT GOZABURO
WAS WRONG.

00:10:36.847 --> 00:10:39.084
THAT'S WHY SETO TOOK
CONTROL OF KAIBA CORP

00:10:39.084 --> 00:10:41.924
AND CHANGED IT
INTO A COMPANY
THAT HELPS PEOPLE.

00:10:41.924 --> 00:10:46.198
SORRY, ALISTER,
BUT WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU
IS NOT OUR FAULT.

00:10:46.198 --> 00:10:47.935
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

00:10:47.935 --> 00:10:48.937
A LOT!

00:10:48.937 --> 00:10:50.606
YOU MAY NOT KNOW THIS,

00:10:50.606 --> 00:10:53.412
BUT MY BROTHER AND I
GREW UP WITHOUT
A FAMILY, ALSO.

00:10:53.412 --> 00:10:55.215
YOU POOR THING.

00:10:55.215 --> 00:10:56.985
NOW IMAGINE
WHAT YOUR LIFE
WOULD BE LIKE

00:10:56.985 --> 00:10:58.955
IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE
YOUR BROTHER EITHER.

00:10:58.955 --> 00:11:01.360
NO. I CAN'T.

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:03.497
DON'T LISTEN TO HIM,
MOKUBA.

00:11:03.497 --> 00:11:05.033
I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP.

00:11:05.033 --> 00:11:07.036
HOW CUTE.

00:11:07.036 --> 00:11:08.607
A FAMILY SPAT.

00:11:08.607 --> 00:11:10.276
DON'T WORRY, MOKUBA.

00:11:10.276 --> 00:11:12.380
YOUR BROTHER
WON'T PUSH YOU
AROUND ANYMORE...

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:14.484
ONCE I TAKE AWAY
HIS SOUL!

00:11:14.484 --> 00:11:16.120
[CACKLING]

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:22.597
TAKE A LOOK
AT YOURSELF.

00:11:22.597 --> 00:11:25.602
EVERYTHING YOU OWN
WAS PAID FOR BY KAIBA CORP.

00:11:25.602 --> 00:11:28.241
THE CLOTHES YOU WEAR,
THE FOOD YOU EAT.

00:11:28.241 --> 00:11:31.246
THAT SAME MONEY
TOOK MY BROTHER AWAY.

00:11:31.246 --> 00:11:34.052
WELL, IT'S TIME
TO PAY ME BACK

00:11:34.052 --> 00:11:35.955
BY GIVING ME YOUR SOUL.

00:11:35.955 --> 00:11:37.725
WAIT A SEC..

00:11:37.725 --> 00:11:39.294
YOU HAVE A GOOD POINT.

00:11:39.294 --> 00:11:41.599
I AGREE, MY STEPFATHER
WAS A SNAKE

00:11:41.599 --> 00:11:44.271
AND WHAT HE DID TO
YOUR FAMILY WAS WRONG

00:11:44.271 --> 00:11:46.776
AND YOU DESERVE
TO BE PAID FOR THAT.

00:11:46.776 --> 00:11:50.382
THEN AGAIN, I DON'T
REALLY CARE FOR THE WAY
YOU GOT ME HERE

00:11:50.382 --> 00:11:52.720
BY THREATENING TO PUT ME
OUT OF BUSINESS.

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.557
SO WHY DON'T
WE CONTINUE THIS DUEL,

00:11:54.557 --> 00:11:56.226
AND IF YOU'RE LUCKY
ENOUGH TO WIN,

00:11:56.226 --> 00:11:58.330
MAYBE I'LL DECIDE
TO HELP YOU OUT.

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:00.501
WHEN I DEFEAT YOU
IN THIS DUEL,

00:12:00.501 --> 00:12:02.237
YOU WILL HELP ME.

00:12:02.237 --> 00:12:03.607
JUST YOU WAIT.

00:12:03.607 --> 00:12:06.813
I ACTIVATE ROYAL DECREE.

00:12:06.813 --> 00:12:08.650
AS LONG AS
THIS CARD'S IN PLAY,

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:12.089
ALL OTHER TRAP CARDS
ON THE FIELD ARE USELESS.

00:12:12.089 --> 00:12:14.928
Kaiba, voice-over:
BUT I NEED
MY CRUSH CARD TO WIN.

00:12:14.928 --> 00:12:19.036
I HOPE MY LITTLE TRAP CARD
DIDN'T PUT A DAMPER
ON YOUR STRATEGY, KAIBA.

00:12:19.036 --> 00:12:21.507
I END MY TURN.

00:12:21.507 --> 00:12:23.177
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

00:12:23.177 --> 00:12:30.791
ALL RIGHT, GORLAG,
ATTACK HIS DRAGON
WITH FIRESTORM SLASH.

00:12:30.791 --> 00:12:33.429
NOW TRY A TASTE
OF YOUR OWN MONSTER.

00:12:33.429 --> 00:12:35.166
VERSAGO THE DESTROYER,

00:12:35.166 --> 00:12:42.780
ATTACK HIS LIFE POINTS
DIRECTLY!

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:45.518
YOU'RE DOWN
TO YOUR LAST 400 POINTS!

00:12:45.518 --> 00:12:47.956
THANKS TO
MY GORLAG'S ABILITY,

00:12:47.956 --> 00:12:51.162
THE MONSTER YOU JUST
LOST BELONGS TO ME,

00:12:51.162 --> 00:12:54.302
ONLY NOW HE'S STRONGER!

00:12:54.302 --> 00:12:57.607
Kaiba, voice-over:
I HAVE TO SUMMON A PRETTY
STRONG MONSTER TO STOP HIM,

00:12:57.607 --> 00:12:59.778
BUT I HAVE NOTHING
TO SACRIFICE.

00:12:59.778 --> 00:13:02.250
THERE'S ONLY ONE CARD
THAT CAN HELP,

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:08.795
BUT I NEED TO DRAW IT NOW!

00:13:08.795 --> 00:13:11.099
I THINK I'LL START
THIS ROUND OFF

00:13:11.099 --> 00:13:15.441
BY ACTIVATING
A SIMPLE MAGIC CARD
KNOWN AS CARD OF DEMISE.

00:13:15.441 --> 00:13:17.645
THIS LETS ME DRAW
3 CARDS.

00:13:17.645 --> 00:13:19.381
WATCH CLOSELY.

00:13:19.381 --> 00:13:21.787
HERE'S WHERE THINGS
GET COMPLICATED.

00:13:21.787 --> 00:13:25.827
NEXT, I'LL ACTIVATE
WHITE DRAGON RITUAL.

00:13:25.827 --> 00:13:28.365
IT LETS ME PLAY ONE
OF MY FAVORITE CARDS

00:13:28.365 --> 00:13:32.139
AS LONG AS I SACRIFICE
A POWERFUL MONSTER FIRST.

00:13:32.139 --> 00:13:35.211
SO I'LL SEND
MY MIGHTY BLUE-EYES
WHITE DRAGON

00:13:35.211 --> 00:13:37.349
STRAIGHT TO
THE GRAVEYARD,

00:13:37.349 --> 00:13:42.358
ALLOWING ME TO SUMMON
PALADIN OF WHITE DRAGON!

00:13:42.358 --> 00:13:44.896
AND NOW I'LL USE
MONSTER REBORN

00:13:44.896 --> 00:13:50.941
TO BRING BACK MY
BLUE-EYES WHITE DRAGON!

00:13:50.941 --> 00:13:58.388
PALADIN, ATTACK
WITH IONIC SPEAR BURST!

00:13:58.388 --> 00:14:01.060
AND NOW THAT ONE OF YOUR
FIRE MONSTERS IS GONE,

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:05.702
YOUR GORLAG LOSES
500 ATTACK POINTS.

00:14:05.702 --> 00:14:17.123
BLUE-EYES WHITE DRAGON,
DESTROY HIS GORLAG!

00:14:17.123 --> 00:14:19.928
I'M NOT READY FOR
THE FUN TO END JUST YET,

00:14:19.928 --> 00:14:22.266
SO I'VE GOT ONE MORE
SURPRISE FOR YOU.

00:14:22.266 --> 00:14:23.869
NOW I'LL FINISH
THINGS OFF

00:14:23.869 --> 00:14:25.439
BY TRADING IN MY PALADIN

00:14:25.439 --> 00:14:30.849
FOR ANOTHER BLUE-EYES
WHITE DRAGON.

00:14:30.849 --> 00:14:33.687
IF YOU THOUGHT I DEVASTATED
YOU THIS TURN,

00:14:33.687 --> 00:14:35.156
THEN JUST WAIT.

00:14:35.156 --> 00:14:36.793
THE WORST IS AHEAD.

00:14:36.793 --> 00:14:39.933
WHATEVER.

00:14:39.933 --> 00:14:42.370
I'VE GOT ONE WORD
FOR YOUR MOVES--

00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:43.940
PREDICTABLE.

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:47.513
I CAN SEE YOUR LAME STRATEGY
COMING FROM A MILE AWAY.

00:14:47.513 --> 00:14:51.386
IF THAT'S THE CASE,
THEN LET'S SEE YOU
DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

00:14:51.386 --> 00:14:55.061
I'LL PLAY A MAGIC CARD--
MY POT OF GREED.

00:14:55.061 --> 00:14:57.665
IT LETS ME DRAW TWO CARDS.

00:14:57.665 --> 00:15:06.616
THEN I ACTIVATE
ANOTHER MAGIC CARD
CALLED AETONYX FLAME!

00:15:06.616 --> 00:15:09.053
HOW COULD YOU HAVE DESTROYED
BOTH OF MY DRAGONS?

00:15:09.053 --> 00:15:12.360
YOU NEED TO BRUSH UP
ON YOUR DUEL MONSTERS CARDS.

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:15.064
AETONYX FLAME
DESTROYS EVERY CREATURE
ON THE FIELD

00:15:15.064 --> 00:15:17.068
THAT ISN'T A FIRE MONSTER.

00:15:17.068 --> 00:15:18.704
AND AS AN ADDED BONUS,

00:15:18.704 --> 00:15:29.559
IT ALLOWS ME TO BRING
MY GORLAG BACK TO THE FIELD
IN ATTACK MODE.

00:15:29.559 --> 00:15:38.576
NEXT, I'LL ACTIVATE
A MAGIC CARD
KNOWN AS FIRE WHIP.

00:15:38.576 --> 00:15:41.914
MY CARDS!

00:15:41.914 --> 00:15:43.484
THANKS TO MY FIRE WHIP,

00:15:43.484 --> 00:15:45.822
YOUR PRECIOUS BLUE-EYES
BELONG TO ME--

00:15:45.822 --> 00:15:49.295
AND THEY'VE BEEN RESURRECTED
AS CREATURES OF FIRE.

00:15:49.295 --> 00:15:51.366
THOSE DRAGONS ARE MINE!

00:15:51.366 --> 00:15:53.770
CALL ME CRAZY,
BUT LAST I CHECKED

00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:56.342
YOUR DRAGONS WERE ON
MY SIDE OF THE FIELD.

00:15:56.342 --> 00:15:59.881
SOON, I'LL USE
YOUR FAVORITE MONSTERS
TO TAKE YOU DOWN.

00:15:59.881 --> 00:16:07.763
CAN YOU SAY
"PERFECT REVENGE"?

00:16:07.763 --> 00:16:11.503
SINCE MY NEWLY ACQUIRED DRAGONS
ARE ALSO FIRE MONSTERS,

00:16:11.503 --> 00:16:16.913
MY GORLAG GETS
A 1,000 POINT BOOST.

00:16:16.913 --> 00:16:19.852
YOU'RE STARING
INTO THE FACE OF
3 UNSTOPPABLE CREATURES

00:16:19.852 --> 00:16:22.858
WITH A GRAND TOTAL
OF 10,000 POINTS.

00:16:22.858 --> 00:16:25.095
BUT, LUCKY FOR YOU,
I CAN'T ATTACK,

00:16:25.095 --> 00:16:28.769
SO I'LL PLACE
ONE CARD FACE DOWN
AND END MY TURN.

00:16:28.769 --> 00:16:31.708
AND THANKS TO THE SACRED
SEAL OF ORICHALCOS,

00:16:31.708 --> 00:16:33.311
WHEN YOU LOSE
YOUR LIFE POINTS,

00:16:33.311 --> 00:16:36.717
YOU'LL LOSE YOUR SOUL.

00:16:36.717 --> 00:16:38.387
YOU'LL SUFFER
JUST LIKE I DID

00:16:38.387 --> 00:16:40.725
AT THE HANDS
OF YOUR FATHER!

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:48.203
Kaiba, voice-over: I'M DOWN
TO MY LAST 400 LIFE POINTS
AND I'M OUT OF MOVES.

00:16:48.203 --> 00:16:50.908
THERE'S NOT A CARD IN MY DECK
THAT CAN SAVE ME NOW.

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:55.583
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:16:58.956 --> 00:17:01.962
I MUST BE HALLUCINATING.

00:17:04.868 --> 00:17:06.471
Woman's voice: KAIBA,

00:17:06.471 --> 00:17:10.278
YOU HAVE BEEN CHOSEN
TO RELEASE THE MIGHTY CRITIAS.

00:17:10.278 --> 00:17:28.278
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS REMOVE THE SWORD.

00:17:28.278 --> 00:17:30.649
ALL RIGHT,
I'M JUST ABOUT READY

00:17:30.649 --> 00:17:32.285
TO WAKE UP
FROM THIS DREAM.

00:17:32.285 --> 00:17:34.256
Woman's voice:
NOW JOIN FORCES.

00:17:34.256 --> 00:17:41.569
ANYTHING TO SHUT YOU UP.

00:17:41.569 --> 00:17:45.244
HEY! LOOK!

00:17:45.244 --> 00:17:48.148
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR, KAIBA?

00:17:48.148 --> 00:17:58.134
ARE YOU GONNA PLAY
YOUR CARD OR NOT?

00:17:58.134 --> 00:17:59.870
Kaiba, voice-over:
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:02.208
I'M SEEING THINGS AGAIN.

00:18:02.208 --> 00:18:04.914
I NEVER PUT THIS CARD
IN MY DECK,

00:18:04.914 --> 00:18:08.453
AND THE PICTURE LOOKS
EXACTLY LIKE THE DRAGON
I JUST DREAMT ABOUT.

00:18:08.453 --> 00:18:11.358
IS THIS ANOTHER ONE
OF ALISTER'S TRICKS?

00:18:11.358 --> 00:18:13.296
Woman's voice: NO.
PLAY THIS CARD.

00:18:13.296 --> 00:18:15.867
IT'S THE ONLY WAY.

00:18:15.867 --> 00:18:18.506
NOW I PLAY
FANG OF CRITIAS!

00:18:18.506 --> 00:18:20.642
WHAT? YOU DON'T HAVE
THAT CARD.

00:18:20.642 --> 00:18:23.014
WHAT DO YOU CALL THIS?

00:18:23.014 --> 00:18:25.619
NEXT, I'LL MERGE MY DRAGON
WITH MY CRUSH CARD

00:18:25.619 --> 00:18:28.858
TO CREATE A NEW MONSTER.

00:18:28.858 --> 00:18:30.194
NO WAY.

00:18:30.194 --> 00:18:32.932
BUT YOU CAN'T FUSE
A TRAP CARD WITH A MONSTER!

00:18:32.932 --> 00:18:35.637
LOOKS TO ME LIKE
I JUST DID, ALISTER.

00:18:35.637 --> 00:18:38.309
HA HA!

00:18:38.309 --> 00:18:43.886
RISE UP,
DOOM VIRUS DRAGON!

00:18:43.886 --> 00:18:45.089
BIG DEAL.

00:18:45.089 --> 00:18:46.458
MINE ARE STRONGER.

00:18:46.458 --> 00:18:49.831
TRUE, BUT DOOM VIRUS DRAGON
HAS A SPECIAL ABILITY

00:18:49.831 --> 00:18:52.335
THAT AUTOMATICALLY DESTROYS
EVERY MONSTER ON THE FIELD

00:18:52.335 --> 00:18:57.679
WHOSE ATTACK STRENGTH
IS 1,500 OR MORE...

00:18:57.679 --> 00:19:01.419
SO ALL YOUR MONSTERS
ARE GONE.

00:19:01.419 --> 00:19:03.556
NOW, DOOM VIRUS DRAGON,

00:19:03.556 --> 00:19:08.432
ATTACK HIS LIFE POINTS
DIRECTLY!

00:19:08.432 --> 00:19:09.501
[LAUGHS]

00:19:09.501 --> 00:19:11.237
GAME OVER. I WIN.

00:19:11.237 --> 00:19:14.243
YOU DIDN'T
BEAT ME YET, KAIBA.

00:19:14.243 --> 00:19:22.926
I ACTIVATE
CONTAGION OF MADNESS!

00:19:22.926 --> 00:19:24.696
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.

00:19:24.696 --> 00:19:26.933
I LOSE 1,900 LIFE POINTS

00:19:26.933 --> 00:19:29.237
THANKS TO YOUR
VIRUS DRAGON'S ATTACK,

00:19:29.237 --> 00:19:39.023
BUT YOU LOSE 950
THANKS TO MY MAGIC CARD.

00:19:39.023 --> 00:19:43.698
IT'S A DRAW!

00:19:43.698 --> 00:19:46.203
Mokuba: SETO!

00:19:46.203 --> 00:19:47.572
HE'S GONE.

00:19:47.572 --> 00:19:49.041
Alister: THIS ISN'T OVER!

00:19:49.041 --> 00:19:50.611
I'LL BE BACK,

00:19:50.611 --> 00:20:01.397
AND YOU'LL PAY FOR WHAT
YOUR FATHER DID TO ME!

00:20:01.397 --> 00:20:06.608
Joey: ARE WE THERE YET?

00:20:06.608 --> 00:20:08.210
HEY, WHY'D WE STOP, MAN?

00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:09.346
HEY, WAIT!

00:20:09.346 --> 00:20:12.786
WHERE DO YA THINK
YOU'RE GOING?

00:20:12.786 --> 00:20:14.367
THAT'S WEIRD.

00:20:14.367 --> 00:20:16.969
WHY'D WE STOP
AT SOME RUNDOWN
GAS STATION?

00:20:16.969 --> 00:20:19.071
Tristan: I DON'T LIKE
THE LOOKS OF THIS.
