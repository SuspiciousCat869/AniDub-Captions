AND IT ALL STARTS
WITH THIS,

00:00:08.671 --> 00:00:11.774
A MAGIC CARD KNOWN AS
ORICHALCOS MIRROR,

00:00:11.774 --> 00:00:15.445
WHICH IN TURN CALLS
4 KNIGHTS TO THE FIELD
TO PROTECT ME.

I ACTIVATE MY TRAP CARD!

MAGIC CARD IS IN PLAY.

WITH RING OF DESTRUCTION!

ARE DESTROYED,

IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO DEFEAT
ME WITHOUT DESTROYING
THESE MONSTERS,

00:00:43.473 --> 00:00:46.276
AND YOU CAN'T DESTROY

WHAT YOU COULDN'T.

NOW ON TO YOUR FRIENDS.

00:08:06.792 --> 00:08:11.163
IF YOU CAN'T CHOOSE
WHICH ONE TO ATTACK,
THEN I'LL CHOOSE FOR YOU,

00:08:11.163 --> 00:08:12.898
AND I'LL USE THIS,

00:08:12.898 --> 00:08:18.070

TWIN BOW CENTAUR!

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:20.138
NEXT I'LL PICK
TWO MONSTERS--

00:08:20.138 --> 00:08:23.108
ONE ON MY SIDE
OF THE FIELD
AND ONE ON YOURS.

00:08:23.108 --> 00:08:26.211
THEN MY CENTAUR
WILL RANDOMLY
CHOOSE ONE OF THEM

00:08:26.211 --> 00:08:29.448
TO REMOVE FROM THE GAME...
PERMANENTLY.

00:08:29.448 --> 00:08:34.653
I THINK I'LL TARGET
KAIBA'S KAISER GLIDER
AND MIRROR KNIGHT JOSEPH.

00:08:37.355 --> 00:08:39.891
IF THAT ARROW REMOVES
JOEY FROM THE GAME,

00:08:39.891 --> 00:08:41.326
WE'LL NEVER
GET HIM BACK.

00:08:41.326 --> 00:08:42.327
YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:08:42.327 --> 00:08:43.395
AND IF IT HITS SETO,

00:08:43.395 --> 00:08:45.831
HE'LL LOSE MOST
OF HIS LIFE POINTS.

00:08:45.831 --> 00:08:48.500
KAIBA OR JOSEPH--

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:53.572
WHO WILL IT CHOOSE?

00:08:53.572 --> 00:08:59.411
LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE THE UNLUCKY ONE
THIS TIME, MR. KAIBA.

00:08:59.411 --> 00:09:00.479

OH, NO!

00:09:04.449 --> 00:09:07.219
I WOULDN'T WANT
TO END THINGS
ON SUCH A SOUR NOTE,

00:09:07.219 --> 00:09:10.555
SO ALLOW ME TO SHARE WITH YOU
THE UPSIDE OF THIS TRAGEDY.

00:09:10.555 --> 00:09:13.992
MY CARD REQUIRES ME
TO END MY TURN.

00:09:13.992 --> 00:09:16.128
THAT IS GOOD NEWS.

00:09:16.128 --> 00:09:20.632
NOW I CAN DO WHAT
YOUR SIAMESE DONKEY TWINS
SHOULD'VE DONE LAST TURN,

00:09:20.632 --> 00:09:24.002
REMOVE JOEY WHEELER
FROM THE GAME
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

00:09:24.002 --> 00:09:25.003

00:09:25.003 --> 00:09:26.471
JUST SAVE IT.

00:09:26.471 --> 00:09:30.375
THAT SECOND RATE CHUMP
HAS HELD ME BACK
FOR THE LAST TIME.

00:09:30.375 --> 00:09:33.311
DIFFERENT DIMENSION DRAGON,
ATTACK.

00:09:33.311 --> 00:09:34.813
NO! DON'T DO THIS!

00:09:34.813 --> 00:09:39.151
TOO LATE!

00:09:39.151 --> 00:09:40.552
NO WAY.

00:09:40.552 --> 00:09:42.654
THIS TIME,
YUGI PROTECTED JOEY.

00:09:42.654 --> 00:09:44.656
[LAUGHS]

00:09:44.656 --> 00:09:45.724
HOW CUTE.

00:09:45.724 --> 00:09:48.026
MAYBE FRIENDSHIP
DOES CONQUER ALL.

00:09:48.026 --> 00:09:51.062
AND THANKS TO YOUR FRIENDS'
LOYALTY TO ONE ANOTHER,

00:09:51.062 --> 00:09:54.666
I'LL BE ABLE
TO CONQUER YOU TWO.

00:09:54.666 --> 00:09:56.234
THAT'S ENOUGH.

00:09:56.234 --> 00:09:57.903
I WON'T LET YOU
USE THEM

00:09:57.903 --> 00:10:02.707
FOR YOUR OWN
SELFISH SCHEME.

00:10:02.707 --> 00:10:05.777
I ACTIVATE MYSTICAL
SPACE TYPHOON,

00:10:05.777 --> 00:10:08.280
WHICH REMOVES
YOUR CENTAUR
FROM THE FIELD.

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:13.652
THAT ENDS MY TURN.

00:10:13.652 --> 00:10:16.454
YOU POOR FOOL.

00:10:16.454 --> 00:10:20.125
YOU JUST WASTED YOUR TURN
DESTROYING A CREATURE
I DIDN'T NEED,

00:10:20.125 --> 00:10:23.395
AND WAIT TILL YOU SEE
WHAT I'M ABOUT TO
REPLACE HIM WITH.

00:10:23.395 --> 00:10:26.865
I SUMMON
ORICHALCOS MALEVOLENCE!

00:10:32.304 --> 00:10:35.207
AND THANKS TO
THE SECOND LAYER
OF THE SACRED SEAL,

00:10:35.207 --> 00:10:38.710
MY POWER INCREASES BY
ANOTHER 3,000 POINTS.

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:40.712
HE'S GOT OVER
15,000.

00:10:40.712 --> 00:10:43.381
YEAH, AND MY BROTHER'S
ONLY GOT 600.

00:10:43.381 --> 00:10:46.585
ONE MORE ATTACK
AND HE'S TOAST.

00:10:46.585 --> 00:10:51.489
I THINK WE BOTH KNOW
WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN NOW,
MR. KAIBA.

00:10:51.489 --> 00:10:53.058
BUT DON'T YOU FRET,

00:10:53.058 --> 00:10:56.595
'CAUSE I'LL MAKE SURE
THAT SOUL OF YOURS
IS PUT TO GOOD USE

00:10:56.595 --> 00:10:59.631
JUST AS SOON AS IT'S MINE.

00:10:59.631 --> 00:11:05.003
ORICHALCOS MALEVOLENCE,
ATTACK.

00:11:05.003 --> 00:11:07.505
IT'S BEEN A REAL BLAST.

00:11:19.035 --> 00:11:23.072
Roland:
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

00:11:23.072 --> 00:11:24.140
GET BACK HERE!

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:29.245
YOU CAN'T
GO IN THERE!

00:11:29.245 --> 00:11:31.147
HOLD ON, DARTZ.

00:11:31.147 --> 00:11:34.383
I ACTIVATE
ATTACK GUIDANCE BARRIER.

00:11:34.383 --> 00:11:37.653
NOW I CAN
REDIRECT YOUR ATTACK
TO A DIFFERENT MONSTER

00:11:37.653 --> 00:11:40.489
AND RAISE
ITS STRENGTH BY 600,

00:11:40.489 --> 00:11:44.393
AND I KNOW EXACTLY
WHO TO PICK--

00:11:44.393 --> 00:11:49.799
YUGI'S BIG SHIELD GARDNA.

00:11:49.799 --> 00:11:51.467
VERY IMPRESSIVE.

00:11:51.467 --> 00:11:54.971
HOWEVER,
MY LIFE POINTS ARE SAFE,
THANKS TO MY KYUTORA,

00:11:54.971 --> 00:12:00.009
AND YOUR PATHETIC GARDNA
IS FORCED TO SWITCH
INTO ATTACK MODE.

00:12:00.009 --> 00:12:01.544
THAT MAY BE TRUE,

00:12:01.544 --> 00:12:04.313
BUT THANKS TO
KAIBA'S TRAP CARD,
YOUR TURN'S DONE.

00:12:04.313 --> 00:12:06.415
MUST YOU
EXPLAIN EVERYTHING?

00:12:06.415 --> 00:12:07.450
JUST GO!

00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:09.652
YOU BETTER HOPE
NOTHING HAPPENS TO ME,

00:12:09.652 --> 00:12:12.989
'CAUSE YOU CAN'T
DO THIS ALONE.

00:12:12.989 --> 00:12:15.157
Kaiba, voice-over:
I ONLY HAVE 600 POINTS LEFT,

00:12:15.157 --> 00:12:19.462
AND THERE'S NOT A MONSTER
IN MY HAND I CAN SUMMON.

00:12:19.462 --> 00:12:23.633
FIRST, I'LL SWITCH MY DRAGON
INTO DEFENSE MODE,

00:12:23.633 --> 00:12:27.403
AND THEN I'LL END MY TURN BY
PLACING TWO CARDS FACEDOWN.

00:12:27.403 --> 00:12:28.804
IT'S UP TO ME NOW.

00:12:28.804 --> 00:12:30.306
IF YOU WANT TO WIN
THIS DUEL,

00:12:30.306 --> 00:12:34.877
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO ATTACK
THOSE MIRROR KNIGHTS.

00:12:34.877 --> 00:12:39.582
Yami-Yugi, voice-over:
NO, I CAN'T TURN MY BACK
ON YUGI AGAIN.

00:12:39.582 --> 00:12:41.417
YOU HAVE TO ATTACK!

00:12:41.417 --> 00:12:44.253
IT'S THE ONLY WAY!

00:12:44.253 --> 00:12:46.088
WE'LL BE FINE.

00:12:46.088 --> 00:12:49.859
IF YOU DON'T ATTACK,
YOU'LL LOSE,

00:12:49.859 --> 00:12:52.728
AND TOO MANY PEOPLE
ARE DEPENDING ON YOU.

00:12:52.728 --> 00:12:55.731
BUT, YUGI, IF ANY
OF YOU ARE ATTACKED,

00:12:55.731 --> 00:12:59.068
YOUR SOULS MAY BE
LOST FOREVER.

00:12:59.068 --> 00:13:00.736
Yugi, voice-over:
TRUST ME.

00:13:00.736 --> 00:13:02.538
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

00:13:02.538 --> 00:13:05.808
DO YOU REALIZE YOU'RE
TALKING TO A HOLOGRAM
WITH YOUR HEAD ON IT?

00:13:05.808 --> 00:13:11.580
KAIBA, ONCE AGAIN,
YOU'RE CLUELESS.

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:13.082
LET'S GO, PHARAOH.

00:13:13.082 --> 00:13:14.483
EVERYONE IS WAITING.

00:13:14.483 --> 00:13:16.619
FIRST, I'LL SWITCH
MY BIG SHIELD GARDNA

00:13:16.619 --> 00:13:19.655
BACK INTO
DEFENSE MODE.

00:13:19.655 --> 00:13:22.792
AND THEN I'LL PLACE
ONE CARD FACEDOWN.

00:13:22.792 --> 00:13:24.794
WITH THAT,
I SHALL END MY TURN.

00:13:24.794 --> 00:13:26.395
PLEASE TELL ME
THIS IS A JOKE.

00:13:26.395 --> 00:13:28.364
[LAUGHS]

00:13:28.364 --> 00:13:30.299
IT'S QUITE
APPARENT THAT
THERE'S NOTHING

00:13:30.299 --> 00:13:32.368
EITHER OF YOU CAN DO
TO STOP ME,

00:13:32.368 --> 00:13:35.271
SO LET'S PUT YOU
OUT OF YOUR MISERY,
SHALL WE?

00:13:41.677 --> 00:13:43.813
Rafael:
YOU DON'T LOOK HAPPY
TO SEE ME,

00:13:43.813 --> 00:13:46.515
AND AFTER ALL
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH.

00:13:46.515 --> 00:13:48.017
WHERE'S THE LOVE?

00:13:48.017 --> 00:13:49.919
DON'T ANSWER THAT.

00:13:49.919 --> 00:13:52.254
I'VE HEARD ENOUGH LIES
FROM YOU.

00:13:52.254 --> 00:13:54.190
THE PHARAOH OPENED ME UP
TO THE TRUTH.

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:55.524
REALLY?

00:13:55.524 --> 00:13:57.460
YEAH, REALLY.

00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:00.563
THANKS TO HIM,
I WAS ABLE TO ESCAPE
THE SEAL OF ORICHALCOS

00:14:00.563 --> 00:14:02.465
WITH MY SOUL
STILL INTACT--

00:14:02.465 --> 00:14:05.868
UNLIKE THEM AND EVERYONE
ELSE YOU USED.

00:14:05.868 --> 00:14:08.971
NOW SET THEM FREE
BEFORE YOU END UP
ON THAT WALL.

00:14:08.971 --> 00:14:11.140
YOUR SOUL
MAY HAVE BEEN SPARED,

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:13.476
BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE
THE ORICHALCOS TOOK

00:14:13.476 --> 00:14:15.478
WHAT WAS LEFT
OF YOUR BRAIN.

00:14:15.478 --> 00:14:16.979
WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

00:14:16.979 --> 00:14:20.049
IT MEANS YOU'RE
MORE GULLIBLE THAN EVER.

00:14:20.049 --> 00:14:24.053
DO YOU HONESTLY THINK
THE DARKNESS THAT ONCE
CONTROLLED YOU IS GONE?

00:14:24.053 --> 00:14:25.087
YES.

00:14:25.087 --> 00:14:26.756
THE PHARAOH SET ME FREE.

00:14:26.756 --> 00:14:29.125
DID HE...

00:14:29.125 --> 00:14:32.228
OR DID HE JUST TRICK YOU
THE WAY YOU THINK I DID?

00:14:32.228 --> 00:14:33.629
STOP IT!

00:14:33.629 --> 00:14:35.464
YOU'RE MESSING
WITH MY HEAD.

00:14:35.464 --> 00:14:38.467
PERHAPS, OR MAYBE
I'M JUST TRYING TO SHOW YOU

00:14:38.467 --> 00:14:40.970
THAT YOU'RE JUST LIKE
EVERYONE ELSE IN THE WORLD.

00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:44.140
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS LOOK AROUND YOU, RAFAEL.

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:47.743
EACH ONE OF THESE POOR FOOLS
GAVE IN TO THEIR DARK SIDE

00:14:47.743 --> 00:14:51.080
AND WAS TAKEN BY
THE SEAL OF ORICHALCOS.

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:54.750
THEY'RE EVIL,
JUST LIKE ALL HUMANS,

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:57.853
WHICH IS WHY I WAS CHOSEN
TO WIPE THEM OUT--

00:14:57.853 --> 00:14:59.755
AND YOU'RE NO DIFFERENT.

00:14:59.755 --> 00:15:02.224
YOU CAN'T JUST WALK AWAY
FROM THE DARKNESS.

00:15:02.224 --> 00:15:04.060
IT'S PART OF WHO YOU ARE.

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:05.861
THAT'S WHY I HIRED YOU.

00:15:05.861 --> 00:15:10.032
YOUR RAGE MADE YOU
THE PERFECT CANDIDATE
TO CARRY OUT MY PLAN.

00:15:10.032 --> 00:15:13.202
YEAH, WELL,
I'M THROUGH BEING ANGRY
AT THE WORLD.

00:15:13.202 --> 00:15:14.470
THAT'S IT.

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:16.205
THE PHARAOH
AND HIS FRIENDS

00:15:16.205 --> 00:15:19.575
REMINDED ME
WHAT LOYALTY AND TRUST
ARE ALL ABOUT.

00:15:19.575 --> 00:15:21.811
I USED TO BE LIKE THEM

00:15:21.811 --> 00:15:23.813
BEFORE YOU CAME
INTO MY LIFE

00:15:23.813 --> 00:15:26.582
AND POISONED MY MIND
WITH THE ORICHALCOS.

00:15:26.582 --> 00:15:27.917
[CHUCKLES]

00:15:27.917 --> 00:15:29.752
[LAUGHS]

00:15:29.752 --> 00:15:31.420
I MISSED THE JOKE.

00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:33.322
YOU ARE THE JOKE.

00:15:33.322 --> 00:15:35.691
THE ORICHALCOS
DIDN'T POISON YOUR MIND.

00:15:35.691 --> 00:15:38.461
IT EXPOSED
WHAT YOU TRULY ARE
ON THE INSIDE--

00:15:38.461 --> 00:15:40.963
A CORRUPT HUMAN BEING
FULL OF ANGER,

00:15:40.963 --> 00:15:43.466
JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE
IN THIS ROOM.

00:15:43.466 --> 00:15:45.234
WHAT DOES
THAT MAKE YOU?

00:15:45.234 --> 00:15:47.736
WELL, YOU MIGHT SAY
I'M A PIONEER

00:15:47.736 --> 00:15:51.841
CHOSEN BY THE ORICHALCOS
TO CARVE OUT A NEW WORLD,

00:15:51.841 --> 00:15:54.310
AND MY TASK IS NEARLY DONE.

00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:59.381
SOON I'LL HAVE ENOUGH POWER
TO AWAKEN THE LEVIATHAN
AND REBUILD CIVILIZATION.

00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:10.414
FOR 10,000 YEARS
I'VE BEEN GATHERING
THE SPIRITS OF MANKIND

00:16:10.414 --> 00:16:14.185
TO AMASS ENOUGH ENERGY
TO REGENERATE
THE GREAT BEAST.

00:16:14.185 --> 00:16:17.788
BUT TIME WAS RUNNING OUT
AND I NEEDED HELP.

00:16:17.788 --> 00:16:19.690
SO YOU FOUND US?

00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:23.194
I REQUIRED 3 SUBORDINATES
TO CARRY OUT MY PLAN.

00:16:23.194 --> 00:16:25.530
THEY NEEDED TO BE
FILLED WITH ENOUGH ANGER

00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:28.299
TO TAP THE FULL POWER
OF THE ORICHALCOS.

00:16:28.299 --> 00:16:30.034
THEY ALSO NEEDED A REASON

00:16:30.034 --> 00:16:31.469
TO HATE THE PEOPLE
OF THIS WORLD

00:16:31.469 --> 00:16:33.771
AS MUCH AS I DO.

00:16:33.771 --> 00:16:36.974
AS SOON AS I ENCOUNTERED
VALON, ALISTER,
AND YOURSELF,

00:16:36.974 --> 00:16:40.978
I KNEW THAT I'D FOUND EXACTLY
WHAT I HAD BEEN SEARCHING FOR.

00:16:40.978 --> 00:16:42.980
OF COURSE,
IT WAS NECESSARY

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:46.284
TO INFLUENCE CERTAIN EVENTS
IN YOUR LIVES.

00:16:46.284 --> 00:16:48.686
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"INFLUENCE"?

00:16:48.686 --> 00:16:51.722
I SEE I'M GOING TO
NEED TO SPELL
THIS OUT FOR YOU.

00:16:51.722 --> 00:16:55.126
LET'S START WITH ALISTER.

00:16:55.126 --> 00:16:58.629
HIS FAMILY WAS CAPTURED BY
GOZABURO KAIBA'S TANKS

00:16:58.629 --> 00:17:01.299
DURING HIS EFFORT
TO TAKE OVER THEIR TOWNSHIP.

00:17:01.299 --> 00:17:03.167
WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

00:17:03.167 --> 00:17:07.238
IS THAT STORY
TRUE, MOKUBA?

00:17:07.238 --> 00:17:09.707
Mokuba:
UNFORTUNATELY,
IT IS.

00:17:09.707 --> 00:17:12.209
OF COURSE,
WHAT ALISTER DOESN'T KNOW

00:17:12.209 --> 00:17:14.812
IS THAT KAIBA'S FATHER
DIDN'T DO A THING.

00:17:14.812 --> 00:17:19.917
THAT HONOR BELONGS TO ME.

00:17:19.917 --> 00:17:25.790
Man: WE COULDN'T
HAVE DONE THIS
WITHOUT YOU, MR. KAIBA.

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:30.795
[CHUCKLES]

00:17:30.795 --> 00:17:32.863
AND THEN THERE'S POOR VALON,

00:17:32.863 --> 00:17:36.200
WHO PRACTICALLY GREW UP
IN A JUVENILE DETENTION CENTER,

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:38.402
THANKS ONCE AGAIN
TO YOURS TRULY.

00:17:38.402 --> 00:17:41.906
I FRAMED HIM
FOR HIS FIRST CRIME
AT THE AGE OF 9.

00:17:41.906 --> 00:17:44.041
[LAUGHS]

00:17:44.041 --> 00:17:47.211
AND, OF COURSE,
WE CAN'T FORGET
ABOUT YOU, RAFAEL.

00:17:47.211 --> 00:17:49.380
AHH, THAT STORMY NIGHT.

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:50.381
NOT THAT.

00:17:50.381 --> 00:17:53.384
YOU COULDN'T HAVE.

00:17:53.384 --> 00:17:55.353
RAFAEL!

00:17:55.353 --> 00:17:58.356
GUYS!

00:17:58.356 --> 00:18:03.361
Dartz, voice-over:
YOUR CAPTAIN DIDN'T TAKE
YOU INTO THAT TYPHOON.

00:18:03.361 --> 00:18:07.131
IT WAS I WHO LED
YOUR SHIP ASTRAY.

00:18:07.131 --> 00:18:10.067
NO! BUT WHY?

00:18:10.067 --> 00:18:13.771
YOU'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO START PAYING
ATTENTION ONE OF THESE DAYS.

00:18:13.771 --> 00:18:17.174
I WATCHED YOU
MASTER DUEL MONSTERS
AT A YOUNG AGE,

00:18:17.174 --> 00:18:19.944
BUT I NEEDED TO UNLOCK
YOUR INNER FURY.

00:18:19.944 --> 00:18:23.914
IT WAS THE ONLY WAY
TO MAKE SURE THAT
YOU WERE STRONG ENOUGH.

00:18:23.914 --> 00:18:28.252
AFTER ALL, I HAD
THE 3 LEGENDARY DRAGONS
TO CONTEND WITH NOW,

00:18:28.252 --> 00:18:31.022
AND QUITE FRANKLY,
YOUR LIFE WAS A BIT
TOO PERFECT.

00:18:31.022 --> 00:18:33.858
SO I MADE SOME
ADJUSTMENTS.

00:18:33.858 --> 00:18:37.294
RAFAEL, YOU MUSTN'T
LISTEN TO HIM!

00:18:37.294 --> 00:18:39.463
EVERYTHING
IS YOUR FAULT.

00:18:39.463 --> 00:18:41.666
YOU TOOK ME
FROM MY FAMILY.

00:18:45.603 --> 00:18:49.940
I NEEDED YOUR ANGER,
YOUR THIRST FOR REVENGE.

00:18:55.813 --> 00:19:01.619
YOU RUINED MY LIFE,
YOU MONSTER!

00:19:06.624 --> 00:19:09.460
[CHUCKLES]

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:11.362
NO!

00:19:11.362 --> 00:19:13.364
IT'S THE SEAL
OF ORICHALCOS!

00:19:13.364 --> 00:19:16.033
YEAH, BUT I DIDN'T SEE
ANYONE PLAY THAT CARD.

00:19:19.704 --> 00:19:22.707
Yami-Yugi, voice-over:
NO! HIS GUARDIAN EATOS!

00:19:22.707 --> 00:19:25.309
RAFAEL,
CONTROL YOUR ANGER.

00:19:25.309 --> 00:19:28.813
YOU CAN STOP THE SEAL!

00:19:28.813 --> 00:19:30.181
Dartz: WRONG, PHARAOH.

00:19:30.181 --> 00:19:32.016
THE ORICHALCOS
LIVES WITHIN HIM

00:19:32.016 --> 00:19:34.185
AND CAN NEVER BE
EXTINGUISHED.

00:19:34.185 --> 00:19:36.320
ITS GLOW BURNS
IN HIS HEART,

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:38.923
AND I'M AFRAID
THERE'S NO TURNING BACK NOW.

00:19:38.923 --> 00:19:41.525
HIS SOUL BELONGS TO ME.

00:19:51.969 --> 00:19:53.871
[CHUCKLES]

00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:01.812
Mokuba:
HE'S BEEN CAPTURED.

00:20:01.812 --> 00:20:03.080
RAFAEL.

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:04.448
OH, MAN.

00:20:04.448 --> 00:20:05.750
CAN YOU HEAR US?

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:10.755
[DARTZ LAUGHS]

00:20:10.755 --> 00:20:12.356
Dartz: ANOTHER SOUL,

00:20:12.356 --> 00:20:15.292
ANOTHER STEP CLOSER
TO AWAKENING THE GREAT BEAST.

00:20:15.292 --> 00:20:17.995
[LAUGHS]

00:20:17.995 --> 00:20:20.631
ALL RIGHT,
THIS ENDS NOW.

00:20:20.631 --> 00:20:23.467
HOW RIGHT YOU ARE.

00:20:23.467 --> 00:20:25.536
I'M JUST ABOUT DONE.

00:20:25.536 --> 00:20:29.774
ONCE I PLAY THIS CARD,
YOUR FATE WILL BE SEALED,

00:20:29.774 --> 00:20:34.211
FOR THE SEAL OF ORICHALCOS
IS ABOUT TO BECOME
EVEN STRONGER.

00:20:34.211 --> 00:20:36.614
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO,
DARTZ?

00:20:36.614 --> 00:20:38.349
IT CAN'T BE GOOD.

00:20:38.349 --> 00:20:42.720
AND NOW,
IT'S TIME TO EXPERIENCE
THE THIRD LEVEL OF DARKNESS.

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:46.457
GO, ORICHALCOS TRITOS!
