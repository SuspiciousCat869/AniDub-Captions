00:08:59.204 --> 00:09:00.474
OH, REALLY?

00:09:00.474 --> 00:09:01.743
AND WHAT'S THAT?

00:09:01.743 --> 00:09:03.546
YOU'RE USING
THE SAME MONSTERS

00:09:03.546 --> 00:09:04.982
YOU USED
IN OUR FIRST DUEL

00:09:04.982 --> 00:09:06.385
TO MESS WITH MY HEAD.

00:09:06.385 --> 00:09:07.487
NO.

00:09:07.487 --> 00:09:08.856
WHO? ME?

00:09:08.856 --> 00:09:11.962
HONESTLY, YOU'RE THINKING
ABOUT THIS WAY TOO MUCH.

00:09:11.962 --> 00:09:14.967
IS THAT SO?

00:09:14.967 --> 00:09:17.506
WELL, HERE COMES
A LITTLE SOMETHING

00:09:17.506 --> 00:09:19.442
FOR YOU TO THINK ABOUT.

00:09:19.442 --> 00:09:27.257
SPEAR DRAGON, ATTACK
HIS TOON ALLIGATOR
WITH CYCLONE BLAST!

00:09:27.257 --> 00:09:29.695
YOUR PATHETIC
LITTLE TOON IS GONE,

00:09:29.695 --> 00:09:31.398
BUT SINCE
IT WAS IN DEFENSE MODE

00:09:31.398 --> 00:09:33.335
YOUR LIFE POINTS
ARE SAFE, RIGHT?

00:09:33.335 --> 00:09:34.403
WRONG.

00:09:34.403 --> 00:09:36.574
THANKS TO MY DRAGON'S
SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:09:36.574 --> 00:09:40.182
YOU LOSE 300 OF 'EM.

00:09:40.182 --> 00:09:44.623
THEN SPEAR DRAGON
AUTOMATICALLY SWITCHES
TO DEFENSE MODE.

00:09:44.623 --> 00:09:47.162
FINALLY,
I PLACE TWO CARDS
FACE DOWN.

00:09:47.162 --> 00:09:49.566
THAT ENDS ROUND ONE.

00:09:49.566 --> 00:09:54.475
WAY TA GO, SETO!

00:09:54.475 --> 00:09:56.879
[REX AND WEEVIL SHUDDERING]

00:09:56.879 --> 00:09:59.117
Rex: I IAN'T
FEEL MY LEGS..

00:09:59.117 --> 00:10:01.254
Weevil:
THOSE ARE MY LEGS.

00:10:01.254 --> 00:10:04.093
[BOTH SCREAM]

00:10:04.093 --> 00:10:06.230
Man: LOOK WHAT
JUST DROPPED IN.

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:08.267
HEY, WE DON'T WANT
ANY TROUBLE.

00:10:08.267 --> 00:10:10.572
Second man:
YOU TWERPS SHOULD HAVE
THOUGHT ABOUT THAT

00:10:10.572 --> 00:10:12.709
BEFORE YOU LANDED
ON OUR STREET.

00:10:12.709 --> 00:10:15.180
ANY IDEAS?

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:16.717
Rex: HERE'S ONE--

00:10:16.717 --> 00:10:21.559
HEEEEELP!

00:10:21.559 --> 00:10:22.962
EXCELLENT.

00:10:22.962 --> 00:10:25.233
THIS CARD SHOULD
SPICE THINGS UP A BIT.

00:10:25.233 --> 00:10:28.138
HA HA! IT'S A MAGICAL
LITTLE NUMBER

00:10:28.138 --> 00:10:30.643
I LIKE TO CALL
"TOON TABLE OF CONTENTS."

00:10:30.643 --> 00:10:32.714
WHAT ON EARTH IS THAT?

00:10:32.714 --> 00:10:36.454
IT'S A MAGIC CARD
THAT ALLOWS ME TO DRAW
ANY CARD FROM MY DECK

00:10:36.454 --> 00:10:38.725
WITH THE WORD "TOON"
IN THE TITLE.

00:10:38.725 --> 00:10:40.027
NOT AGAIN!

00:10:40.027 --> 00:10:41.263
TOON WORLD?

00:10:41.263 --> 00:10:43.634
DON'T SOUND
SO DISAPPOINTED.

00:10:43.634 --> 00:10:45.638
OF ALL THE CARDS
I'VE CREATED,

00:10:45.638 --> 00:10:47.808
THIS ONE'S BY FAR
MY FAVORITE.

00:10:47.808 --> 00:10:51.750
I'M SURE ONCE YOU SEE IT
YOU'LL CHANGE YOUR TUNE.

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:54.588
PRESENTING TOON WORLD.

00:10:54.588 --> 00:10:56.825
THIS MAGIC CARD
ALLOWS ME TO SUMMON

00:10:56.825 --> 00:11:00.465
ANY AND ALL
OF MY TOON MONSTERS
TO THE FIELD.

00:11:00.465 --> 00:11:03.471
AND ON WORLD'S COST
OF ADMISSION IS
A MERE 1,000 LIFE POINTS!!

00:11:09.816 --> 00:11:11.653
NOW, WHY DON'T
WE START THIS SHOW

00:11:11.653 --> 00:11:13.691
WITH A NEW FAVORITE
OF MINE, SHALL WE?

00:11:13.691 --> 00:11:15.561
TOON MASKED SORCERER!

00:11:15.561 --> 00:11:17.631
HE MAY SEEM HARMLESS,

00:11:17.631 --> 00:11:20.437
BUT HE HAS QUITE THE TEMPER.

00:11:20.437 --> 00:11:21.472
[PEGASUS CACKLING]

00:11:25.707 --> 00:11:28.078
Pegasus: YOU'RE IN
MY WORLD NOW, KAIBA BOY!

00:11:28.078 --> 00:11:31.017
NOW THAT PEGASUS PLAYED
HIS TOON WORLD CARD

00:11:31.017 --> 00:11:33.121
HE CAN SUMMON
ANY TOON MONSTER HE WANTS,

00:11:33.121 --> 00:11:35.459
AND HE'S GOT TONS OF 'EM.

00:11:35.459 --> 00:11:37.864
IT'S TIME
TO GIVE YOU A TASTE

00:11:37.864 --> 00:11:40.368
OF YOUR OWN MEDICINE
WITH THIS--

00:11:40.368 --> 00:11:44.308
MY CLONING TRAP CARD.

00:11:44.308 --> 00:11:47.047
WHY DON'T YOU TRY DUELING
WITH SOME ORIGINALITY?

00:11:47.047 --> 00:11:49.352
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM,
PEGASUS?

00:11:49.352 --> 00:11:52.725
ARE YOU ANNOYED BECAUSE
I'VE MADE IT POINTLESS
FOR YOU TO ATTACK?

00:11:52.725 --> 00:11:54.294
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:11:54.294 --> 00:11:57.800
I MEAN THAT
ONE OF US WAS USING
HIS BRAIN TODAY,

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.071
AND I'M NOT
TALKING ABOUT YOU.

00:12:00.071 --> 00:12:01.875
NOW IF YOU ATTACK ME,

00:12:01.875 --> 00:12:04.146
YOU'LL DESTROY YOUR OWN
MONSTER AS WELL.

00:12:04.146 --> 00:12:05.749
CARE TO GIVE IT A SHOT?

00:12:05.749 --> 00:12:07.686
YOU'VE SAVED YOURSELF
FOR NOW.

00:12:07.686 --> 00:12:09.356
NO KIDDING.

00:12:09.356 --> 00:12:11.627
NEXT, I'LL PLAY
MY FAVORITE CARD.

00:12:11.627 --> 00:12:12.695
READY?

00:12:12.695 --> 00:12:14.732
I SACRIFICE
SPEAR DRAGON

00:12:14.732 --> 00:12:17.070
AND TOON MASKED
SORCERER.

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:18.205
OH, NO!

00:12:18.205 --> 00:12:19.776
IS THAT WHAT
I THINK IT IS?

00:12:19.776 --> 00:12:22.781
I SUMMON MY BLUE-EYES
WHITE DRAGON!

00:12:30.362 --> 00:12:32.199
THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKIN' ABOUT!

00:12:32.199 --> 00:12:36.006
HE'S HUNGRY,
AND YOUR TOON
IS ON THE MENU.

00:12:36.006 --> 00:12:37.575
HE'LL HAVE TO STARVE,

00:12:37.575 --> 00:12:39.312
'CAUSE IN CASE
YOU'VE FORGOTTEN,

00:12:39.312 --> 00:12:42.184
MY TOONS
CAN ONLY BE DESTROYED
BY OTHER TOONS.

00:12:42.184 --> 00:12:44.254
I'M WELL AWARE OF THAT,

00:12:44.254 --> 00:12:47.027
BUT I WON'T LET
A TECHNICALITY STOP ME.

00:12:47.027 --> 00:12:49.431
WELL, THEN MAYBE
I CAN STOP YOU
WITH THIS TRAP.

00:12:49.431 --> 00:12:50.834
WHAT?

00:12:50.834 --> 00:12:57.780
I ACTIVATE TOON MASK.

00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:00.519
THIS CARD LETS ME
TRADE IN MY SORCERER

00:13:00.519 --> 00:13:03.224
FOR A TOON VERSION
OF YOUR MONSTER.

00:13:03.224 --> 00:13:04.526
A WHAT?

00:13:04.526 --> 00:13:11.874
SAY HELLO
TO MY BLUE-EYES
TOON DRAGON.

00:13:11.874 --> 00:13:14.278
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
I HATE THAT THING!

00:13:14.278 --> 00:13:15.947
YOUR CARTOON DRAGON
IS A DISGRACE

00:13:15.947 --> 00:13:17.684
TO THE ORIGINAL
BLUE-EYES!

00:13:17.684 --> 00:13:21.725
DON'T YOU REALIZE
CARTOONS HAVE FEELINGS, TOO?

00:13:21.725 --> 00:13:24.631
WELL, LET'S SEE
HOW HE FEELS ABOUT
MY NEXT CARD.

00:13:24.631 --> 00:13:30.008
I ACTIVATE
THE MAGIC CARD
SHRINK!

00:13:30.008 --> 00:13:35.718
IT MAKES
YOUR PUNY DRAGON
EVEN PUNIER.

00:13:35.718 --> 00:13:36.787
SO WHAT?

00:13:36.787 --> 00:13:38.690
HE'S STILL
INDESTRUCTIBLE.

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:41.563
ALL YOU DID
WAS MAKE MY MONSTER
MORE LOVEABLE.

00:13:41.563 --> 00:13:45.136
I'M THROUGH DEALING WITH
YOUR PITIFUL EXCUSE
FOR A DRAGON,

00:13:45.136 --> 00:13:49.811
SO LET'S FOCUS
ON THE REAL BLUE-EYES.

00:13:49.811 --> 00:13:55.188
THIS CARD
MAKES ITS ATTACK
EVEN MORE FIERCE.

00:13:55.188 --> 00:13:56.791
IT ISN'T GOING TO WORK.

00:13:56.791 --> 00:14:00.665
WHICH PART OF
"TOONS CAN'T BE DESTROYED"
DIDN'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

00:14:00.665 --> 00:14:03.670
BLUE-EYES, ATTACK
WITH WHITE LIGHTNING!

00:14:09.381 --> 00:14:13.289
ARE WE CLEAR NOW
ON THE WHOLE TOONS BEING
INDESTRUCTIBLE THING?

00:14:13.289 --> 00:14:15.560
YES, BUT YOU SEEM
TO HAVE FORGOTTEN

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:18.431
ABOUT MY CHARM
OF LAMENTATION
MAGIC CARD.

00:14:18.431 --> 00:14:19.834
WHAT ABOUT IT?

00:14:19.834 --> 00:14:22.005
AS LONG AS IT REMAINS
ON THE FIELD,

00:14:22.005 --> 00:14:24.342
I GET TO DRAW
ONE CARD FROM MY DECK

00:14:24.342 --> 00:14:26.280
EVERY TIME MY BLUE-EYES
WHITE DRAGON

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:28.017
ATTACKS AND FAILS.

00:14:28.017 --> 00:14:30.086
AND SINCE YOUR TOONS
CAN'T BE DESTROYED,

00:14:30.086 --> 00:14:31.790
I'LL KEEP DRAWING CARDS.

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:34.595
THE KEY TO BEATING
THIS WASHED-UP HAS-BEEN

00:14:34.595 --> 00:14:36.332
IS SOMEWHERE IN MY DECK.

00:14:36.332 --> 00:14:37.935
I JUST HAVE TO KEEP
PICKING CARDS

00:14:37.935 --> 00:14:39.371
TILL I FIND IT.

00:14:39.371 --> 00:14:41.475
BACK TO ME.

00:14:41.475 --> 00:14:45.182
I'LL START BY
GIVING UP 500
OF MY LIFE POINTS.

00:14:45.182 --> 00:14:47.186
THIS ALLOWS
MY BLUE-EYES TOON DRAGON

00:14:47.186 --> 00:14:50.325
TO ATTACK
YOUR LIFE
POINTS DIRECTLY.

00:14:50.325 --> 00:14:54.299
THE TIME HAS COME,
MY ANGRY LITTLE TOON.

00:14:54.299 --> 00:14:57.939
UNLEASH YOUR FURY
UPON KAIBA BOY.

00:14:57.939 --> 00:14:59.910
I DON'T THINK SO.

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:02.414
NEGATE ATTACK!

00:15:02.414 --> 00:15:04.352
YOU'RE NO FUN.

00:15:04.352 --> 00:15:06.088
THIS TRAP CARD

00:15:06.088 --> 00:15:08.025
AUTOMATICALLY
PUTS AN END
TO YOUR ATTACK

00:15:08.025 --> 00:15:10.930
BEFORE IT'S ABLE
TO HIT ITS TARGET,

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:13.302
SO YOU SPENT
YOUR LIFE POINTS
FOR NOTHING.

00:15:13.302 --> 00:15:15.706
I HAVE TO DISAGREE,

00:15:15.706 --> 00:15:22.051
THANKS TO A MAGIC CARD
CALLED TOON ROLLBACK.

00:15:22.051 --> 00:15:23.888
THIS LETS ME
REWIND OUR DUEL,

00:15:23.888 --> 00:15:26.293
GIVING ME A SECOND CHANCE
TO ATTACK.

00:15:26.293 --> 00:15:28.130
HOLD ON.

00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:30.401
THE ROLLBACK CARD
DOESN'T WORK
THAT WAY, PEGASUS.

00:15:30.401 --> 00:15:31.903
YOUR BLUE-EYES
TOON DRAGON

00:15:31.903 --> 00:15:34.341
STILL CAN'T ATTACK
TWICE IN ONE TURN.

00:15:34.341 --> 00:15:36.145
THAT'S NOT MY PLAN.

00:15:36.145 --> 00:15:38.114
SHAME ON YOU.

00:15:38.114 --> 00:15:41.955
I'D SUGGEST PAYING ATTENTION
INSTEAD OF JUMPING
TO CONCLUSIONS.

00:15:41.955 --> 00:15:42.991
JUST GO.

00:15:42.991 --> 00:15:44.627
AS I WAS SAYING,

00:15:44.627 --> 00:15:48.133
I HAVE NO INTENTION
OF ATTACKING YOU
WITH MY DRAGON AGAIN.

00:15:48.133 --> 00:15:52.408
NO, HE'S NO LONGER
OF ANY USE TO ME.

00:15:52.408 --> 00:15:57.819
SO I'VE DECIDED
TO TRADE HIM IN
FOR SOMETHING BETTER.

00:15:57.819 --> 00:16:00.623
OH, TOON
DARK MAGICIAN GIRL...

00:16:06.702 --> 00:16:09.173
ATTACK KAIBA BOY'S
LIFE POINTS, WON'T YOU?

00:16:09.173 --> 00:16:11.043
HI-YAH!

00:16:19.726 --> 00:16:22.497
SHE PACKS QUITE
A LITTLE PUNCH,
DOESN'T SHE?

00:16:24.234 --> 00:16:26.639
AND SO DO I. WATCH THIS.

00:16:26.639 --> 00:16:34.320
BLUE-EYES,
ATTACK HIS TOON
DARK MAGICIAN GIRL.

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:37.359
BUT THOSE TOON MONSTERS
CAN'T BE DESTROYED
BY BLUE-EYES!

00:16:37.359 --> 00:16:45.006
SETO!

00:16:45.006 --> 00:16:52.254
TA-DA!

00:16:52.254 --> 00:16:58.065
REMEMBER,
EVERY TIME MY BLUE-EYES
ATTACK FAILS, I DRAW.

00:16:58.065 --> 00:16:59.133
[CHUCKLES]

00:16:59.133 --> 00:17:01.738
I MUST HAVE
MISSED THE JOKE.

00:17:01.738 --> 00:17:05.178
YOU ARE A JOKE, PEGASUS.

00:17:05.178 --> 00:17:09.152
YOU'RE JUST AS OUTDATED
AS YOUR STRATEGIES.

00:17:09.152 --> 00:17:12.424
YOUR TOON MONSTERS
MAY BE INDESTRUCTIBLE,

00:17:12.424 --> 00:17:16.666
BUT ONLY AS LONG AS YOU
HAVE YOUR TOON WORLD
MAGIC CARD ON THE FIELD.

00:17:16.666 --> 00:17:19.004
WITHOUT IT,
THEY'RE HISTORY.

00:17:19.004 --> 00:17:20.741
SO? WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

00:17:20.741 --> 00:17:22.343
I ACTIVATE
THE MAGIC CARD

00:17:22.343 --> 00:17:27.353
A WINGBEAT
OF GIANT DRAGON.

00:17:27.353 --> 00:17:29.356
WHAT DO YOU PLAN
TO DO WITH THAT?

00:17:29.356 --> 00:17:33.331
FIRST I'LL RETURN
MY BLUE-EYES TO MY HAND.

00:17:33.331 --> 00:17:35.702
THEN I CAN WIPE ALL
MAGIC AND TRAP CARDS

00:17:35.702 --> 00:17:38.073
FROM YOUR SIDE
OF THE FIELD,

00:17:38.073 --> 00:17:41.079
WHICH MEANS
YOUR TOON WORLD
IS TOAST.

00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:55.740
MY PRECIOUS TOON WORLD.

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:57.076
Mokuba:
NICE ONE, SETO!

00:17:57.076 --> 00:17:59.680
YA DID IT.

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:02.953
I NEVER DOUBTED
YA FOR A SECOND.

00:18:02.953 --> 00:18:04.589
I'LL FINISH BY
SUMMONING VERSAGO
THE DESTROYER

00:18:04.589 --> 00:18:07.562
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:18:07.562 --> 00:18:10.333
YOUR MOVE,
PEGASUS.

00:18:10.333 --> 00:18:13.741
HEL-LO?

00:18:13.741 --> 00:18:17.079
LAST CHANCE,
THEN I WIN.

00:18:17.079 --> 00:18:19.183
I'M TAKING YOUR SILENCE
AS A FORFEIT.

00:18:19.183 --> 00:18:20.820
NOT THAT I BLAME YOU.

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:24.460
I'D QUIT, TOO,
IF MY STRATEGY WAS
AS LAME AS YOURS.

00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:26.898
YOU'RE USING
THE EXACT SAME TACTICS

00:18:26.898 --> 00:18:29.469
YOU USED THE FIRST TIME
WE DUELED HERE.

00:18:29.469 --> 00:18:33.077
IN FACT, YOU'VE ALMOST
MADE THE SAME MOVES
CARD FOR CARD.

00:18:33.077 --> 00:18:35.682
WHAT'S THE DEAL,
PEGASUS?

00:18:35.682 --> 00:18:37.217
YOU' A LOT OF THINGS,,

00:18:37.217 --> 00:18:39.088
BUT PREDICTABLE
ISN'T ONE OF 'EM.

00:18:39.088 --> 00:18:42.461
I JUST HAVEN'T BEEN
MYSELF LATELY.

00:18:42.461 --> 00:18:43.930
IN FACT...

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:46.468
[VOICE CHANGES]
I MEAN THAT
QUITE LITERALLY.

00:18:46.468 --> 00:18:47.537
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:18:47.537 --> 00:18:55.085
SURPRISE!

00:18:55.085 --> 00:18:58.491
I'VE WAITED FOR THIS DAY
FOR A LONG TIME, KAIBA BOY.

00:18:58.491 --> 00:19:00.995
YOU'RE GONNA PAY
FOR TRICKING ME
LIKE THAT.

00:19:00.995 --> 00:19:03.233
[AS PEGASUS]
PRETTY GOOD IMITATION, RIGHT?

00:19:03.233 --> 00:19:04.937
IDENTIFY YOURSELF.

00:19:04.937 --> 00:19:07.341
ALISTER'S THE NAME,
KAIBA BOY!

00:19:07.341 --> 00:19:12.852
NOW LET'S DUEL!!

00:19:12.852 --> 00:19:15.990
THIS MAGIC CARD
IS ABOUT TO CHANGE
EVERYTHING.

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:21.200
ACTIVATING
SEAL OF ORICHALCOS.

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:25.575
WHAT'S THAT?

00:19:25.575 --> 00:19:33.189
THIS IS NUTS!

00:19:33.189 --> 00:19:35.928
EXPLAIN YOURSELF NOW!

00:19:35.928 --> 00:19:38.065
OH, AS IF YOU'RE GONNA
BELIEVE ME?

00:19:38.065 --> 00:19:39.601
TRY ME.

00:19:39.601 --> 00:19:42.139
WE'RE TRAPPED IN HERE
TILL THE DUEL'S OVER.

00:19:42.139 --> 00:19:45.345
THEN ONCE I CRUSH YOU,
I'LL BE ABLE TO GET OUT.

00:19:45.345 --> 00:19:47.650
OF COURSE, YOU,
ON THE OTHER HAND,

00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:50.789
WON'T BE QUITE AS LUCKY
AS MYSELF, KAIBA BOY.

00:19:50.789 --> 00:19:52.263
WHAT DO YOU
MEAN?

00:19:52.263 --> 00:19:54.732
WHEN YOU LOSE,

00:19:54.732 --> 00:19:58.503
YOUR SOUL WILL BE
LOCKED AWAY
FOR ALL ETERNITY...

00:19:58.503 --> 00:20:01.406
BUT THIS TIME,
YOU WON'T BE SET FREE.
