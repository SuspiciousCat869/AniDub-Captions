BE CAREFUL!

00:09:11.645 --> 00:09:13.413
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:13.413 --> 00:09:15.215
Yami-Yugi:
WEEVIL UNDERWOOD!

00:09:15.215 --> 00:09:17.117
ARE YOU
BEHIND THIS!?

00:09:17.117 --> 00:09:19.986
YOU'D BETTER START
EXPLAINING YOURSELF!

00:09:19.986 --> 00:09:21.521
Tea: WEEVIL?

00:09:21.521 --> 00:09:23.390

00:09:25.358 --> 00:09:27.561
A REMATCH WITH
THE KING OF GAMES!

00:09:27.561 --> 00:09:29.563
ARE YOU NUTS!?

00:09:29.563 --> 00:09:32.499
I'M JUST IN THE MOOD
FOR A FRIENDLY DUEL.

00:09:32.499 --> 00:09:35.402
WEEVIL, WHO PUT YOU
UP TO THIS?

00:09:35.402 --> 00:09:36.870
NO ONE DID.

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:38.505
I FIGURED
THIS WAS A GOOD TIME

00:09:38.505 --> 00:09:44.945
TO TEST OUT MY NEW SECRET
WEAPON, THAT'S ALL.

00:09:44.945 --> 00:09:46.613

AS LONG AS I HAVE
ULTIMATE POWER!

00:10:05.265 --> 00:10:06.533
YOU'RE WRONG.

00:10:06.533 --> 00:10:08.001
THEN JUST DUEL ME!

00:10:08.001 --> 00:10:09.269
[GRUNTS]

00:10:09.269 --> 00:10:10.737
Tea:
WAIT A MINUTE!

00:10:10.737 --> 00:10:12.372
TEA! NO!

00:10:12.372 --> 00:10:13.607
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS!

00:10:13.607 --> 00:10:15.508
WEEVIL!
DON'T YOU REALIZE

00:10:15.508 --> 00:10:17.310
THAT IF
YOU GO THROUGH
WITH THIS DUEL,

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:19.379
ONE OF YOU GUYS
IS GONNA LOSE
YOUR SOUL FOREVER!?

00:10:19.379 --> 00:10:20.547
TEA!

00:10:20.547 --> 00:10:21.948
OF COURSE I DO!

00:10:21.948 --> 00:10:24.084
THAT'S THE WHOLE REASON
I'M HERE!

00:10:24.084 --> 00:10:27.153
TO MAKE HIM PAY
BY SEALING HIM AWAY!!

00:10:27.153 --> 00:10:28.255
OH, NO!

00:10:28.255 --> 00:10:29.723
DON'T WORRY.

00:10:29.723 --> 00:10:32.859
SOON YOU'LL BE LOCKED AWAY
WITH YOUR FRIEND YUGI, PHARAOH!

00:10:32.859 --> 00:10:34.227

00:10:34.227 --> 00:10:36.730
WHERE IS HE!? TELL ME!

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:39.866
I'M AFRAID THE ONLY WAY
TO FIND OUT IS TO DUEL ME!

00:10:39.866 --> 00:10:41.501
SO IF YOU BACK DOWN NOW,

00:10:41.501 --> 00:10:43.637
THEN YOU'LL NEVER SEE
THAT LITTLE TWERP AGAIN!

00:10:43.637 --> 00:10:44.938
VERY WELL!

00:10:44.938 --> 00:10:46.373
THEN LET'S DUEL!

00:10:46.373 --> 00:10:51.911
HA HA HA HA!
WISE CHOICE, PHARAOH!

00:10:51.911 --> 00:10:53.813

00:11:04.751 --> 00:11:07.654
WEEVIL?

WELL, WE'LL JUST SEE
ABOUT THAT, WON'T WE?

00:11:16.663 --> 00:11:18.498
I'VE BEEN GIVEN

00:11:18.498 --> 00:11:20.534

OH, YEAH?

00:11:44.992 --> 00:11:46.260

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.328
WHEN I ACTIVATE THIS CARD!

00:11:48.328 --> 00:11:49.396

00:12:21.461 --> 00:12:23.997
AHH! HA HA HA!

00:12:23.997 --> 00:12:27.467

THIS DUEL BIG TIME!

00:12:38.478 --> 00:12:40.447

DANKS FOR THE REMINDA.

00:12:40.447 --> 00:12:43.984
LET'S DO THIS.
IT'S PAYBACK TIME!

SORRY, REX.
I WON'T DUEL!

00:12:47.154 --> 00:12:52.826
YOU DON'T HAVE
MUCH CHOICE!

00:12:52.826 --> 00:12:55.162
I'VE IMPROVED
SINCE OUR LAST DUEL.

00:12:55.162 --> 00:12:58.031
BUT YOU'LL SEE THAT
FOR YOURSELF SOON ENOUGH!

00:12:58.031 --> 00:12:59.967
YOU CAN'T DO THIS!

00:12:59.967 --> 00:13:01.601
GET BACK IN THE TRAIN, TEA.

00:13:01.601 --> 00:13:02.970
BUT WHY?

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:05.005
Yami-Yugi:
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS UP HERE,

00:13:05.005 --> 00:13:08.408
AND THERE'S NO TELLING
WHAT WEEVIL WILL DO.

00:13:08.408 --> 00:13:11.311
I WON'T KEEP YOU IN SUSPENSE
ANY LONGER!

00:13:11.311 --> 00:13:13.981
HA HA HA HA!
IT'S MY MOVE!

00:13:13.981 --> 00:13:17.217
AND I THINK I'LL PLAY
THE SEAL OF ORICHALCOS!

00:13:17.217 --> 00:13:20.120
WEEVIL,
DON'T BE A FOOL.

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:22.322
WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE PROBLEM?

00:13:22.322 --> 00:13:25.092
YOU'VE PLAYED THIS CARD
BEFORE, HAVEN'T YOU?

00:13:25.092 --> 00:13:26.660
IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN,

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:31.231
THIS IS WHAT YOU USED
TO LOCK LITTLE YUGI AWAY!

00:13:31.231 --> 00:13:32.733
HA HA HA!

00:13:32.733 --> 00:13:34.668
NOW IT'S MY TURN!

00:13:34.668 --> 00:13:37.904
I NEED TO EXPERIENCE
THIS CARD'S POWER FIRSTHAND!

00:13:37.904 --> 00:13:40.974
AND WHEN YOU LOSE,
YOU'LL JOIN YOUR
LITTLE FRIEND!

IN DANGER ALSO!

I'M READY TO DUEL!

00:14:24.985 --> 00:14:27.754
LOOKS LIKE THE BATTLES
ARE UNDERWAY.

00:14:27.754 --> 00:14:29.990
Rafael: YES, MASTER.
AND IF ALL GOES WELL,

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:33.326
THE SOUL OF THE PHARAOH
WILL SOON BE YOURS.

00:14:33.326 --> 00:14:35.729
OF COURSE, WE WIN
NO MATTER WHAT,

00:14:35.729 --> 00:14:40.267
BECAUSE WHATEVER
THE FINAL OUTCOME IS,
WE GET TWO SOULS.

00:14:40.267 --> 00:14:42.736
HA HA HA HA!

00:14:42.736 --> 00:14:47.074
Weevil:
SINCE I CHALLENGED YOU,
I'LL START THINGS OFF!

00:14:47.074 --> 00:14:48.642
AND I'LL PLAY...

00:14:48.642 --> 00:14:54.381
MY GOOD FRIEND
PHEROMONE WASP!

00:14:54.381 --> 00:14:55.982
IT'S NOT STRONG NOW...

00:14:55.982 --> 00:14:58.318
BUT THE POWER OF
THE SEAL OF ORICHALCOS

00:14:58.318 --> 00:15:00.487
GIVES IT
A 500-POINT BOOST!

00:15:00.487 --> 00:15:05.292
NEXT I'LL PLACE
TWO CARDS FACEDOWN
AND END MY TURN.

00:15:05.292 --> 00:15:09.796
VERY WELL! MY MOVE!

00:15:09.796 --> 00:15:14.968
I SUMMON OBNOXIOUS
CELTIC GUARDIAN!

00:15:14.968 --> 00:15:19.039
A STRONGER MONSTER
THAN YOURS!

00:15:19.039 --> 00:15:20.507
HE BETTER NOT ATTACK!

00:15:20.507 --> 00:15:22.776
WEEVIL HAS
TWO FACEDOWN CARDS!

00:15:22.776 --> 00:15:24.444
HOLD ON! DON'T DO IT!

00:15:24.444 --> 00:15:25.979
CELTIC GUARDIAN,

00:15:25.979 --> 00:15:29.449
CRUSH HIS
PHEROMONE WASP NOW!

00:15:29.449 --> 00:15:33.320
I DON'T THINK SO!
YOU JUST ACTIVATED MY TRAP!

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:36.089
A HANDY LITTLE CARD
CALLED MIMESIS!

00:15:36.089 --> 00:15:37.457
OH, NO!

00:15:37.457 --> 00:15:39.659
YUP! IT ALLOWS ME
TO TRADE IN

00:15:39.659 --> 00:15:42.062
MY INSECT MONSTER
FOR ANOTHER ONE!

00:15:42.062 --> 00:15:44.064
SO I GET TO CHOOSE
WHICH MONSTER

00:15:44.064 --> 00:15:46.833
YOUR OBNOXIOUS CELTIC
GUARDIAN ATTACKS!

00:15:46.833 --> 00:15:50.837
AND NOW, MY PHEROMONE WASP...
RETURN TO MY HAND!

00:15:50.837 --> 00:15:54.307
AND MY PARASITE CATERPILLAR
WILL TAKE ITS PLACE!

00:15:54.307 --> 00:15:55.509
NOT THAT!

00:15:55.509 --> 00:16:00.680
IT HAS THE POWER
TO INFECT MY MONSTER!

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:02.415
HA HA HA HA!

00:16:02.415 --> 00:16:04.317
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT!

00:16:04.317 --> 00:16:10.524
YOUR GUARDIAN'S
BEEN INFECTED!

00:16:10.524 --> 00:16:11.825
NO!

00:16:11.825 --> 00:16:14.060
Weevil: YOU'RE ONLY HALF
THE DUELIST I REMEMBER!

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:16.596
IS THAT 'CAUSE YOU LOST
YOUR OTHER HALF!?

00:16:16.596 --> 00:16:17.831
HA HA HA HA!

00:16:22.563 --> 00:16:24.364
Rex: ARE YOU
GONNA DUEL, WHEELER?

00:16:24.364 --> 00:16:26.300
OR JUST STAND THERE
LIKE A LOSER

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:28.135
WHILE I TAKE YOU APART?

00:16:28.135 --> 00:16:30.070
I GOT NO CHOICE.

00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:33.040
A'RIGHT. I DIDN'T
WANNA DO DIS...

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:34.808
BUT YOU GOT YOURSELF
A DUEL!

00:16:34.808 --> 00:16:36.543
ARE YOU SURE!?

00:16:36.543 --> 00:16:40.047
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
TO SAVE YUGE, SO YES!

00:16:40.047 --> 00:16:41.482
GOOD ANSWER!

00:16:41.482 --> 00:16:44.151
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR
THIS MOMENT FOR YEARS!

00:16:44.151 --> 00:16:46.720
AS MUCH AS I HATE
DIS LITTLE RUNT,

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.989
I CAN'T LET
THE ORICHALCOS TAKE 'IM.

00:16:48.989 --> 00:16:51.225
NO ONE DESERVES DAT!

00:16:51.225 --> 00:16:52.893
BY THE WAY...

00:16:52.893 --> 00:16:59.767
BEFORE MY TURN BEGINS,
I CAN PLAY THIS!

00:16:59.767 --> 00:17:02.136
SAY WHAT!? BEFORE
YOUR TURN BEGINS!?

00:17:02.136 --> 00:17:03.403
THAT'S RIGHT!

00:17:03.403 --> 00:17:05.272
IF I HAVE A GILASAURUS
IN MY HAND,

00:17:05.272 --> 00:17:08.475
IT AUTOMATICALLY JUMPS
TO THE FIELD BEFORE
I MAKE MY MOVE!

00:17:08.475 --> 00:17:10.043
AND I'VE GOT TWO!

00:17:10.043 --> 00:17:13.480
SO YOU'LL HAFTA DEAL WITH
DOUBLE THE DINO NOW!

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:15.816
I'M NOT OFF TO
A GREAT START!

00:17:15.816 --> 00:17:16.850
SO NOW WHAT!?

00:17:16.850 --> 00:17:19.019
I'M NOT FINISHED YET!

00:17:19.019 --> 00:17:22.456
I SUMMON KAITOPTERA!

00:17:22.456 --> 00:17:23.724
AW, MAN!

00:17:23.724 --> 00:17:25.993
DIS GUY'S ALREADY GOT
3 MONSTERS ON THE FIELD

00:17:25.993 --> 00:17:27.261
AND I'VE GOT ZIP!

00:17:27.261 --> 00:17:29.229
PLUS THE SEAL
OF ORICHALCOS

00:17:29.229 --> 00:17:33.700
MAKES MY 3 DINOSAURS
EVEN STRONGER!

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:35.469
HA HA! NOW DAT
I THINK ABOUT IT,

00:17:35.469 --> 00:17:36.904
YOU JUST LUCKED OUT

00:17:36.904 --> 00:17:38.806
BY GETTING DEALT
A GOOD OPENING HAND.

00:17:38.806 --> 00:17:40.774
BUT YOU CAN'T WIN A DUEL
WITH JUST LUCK!

00:17:40.774 --> 00:17:42.042
THAT'S FUNNY!

00:17:42.042 --> 00:17:44.545
YOU ONLY BEAT ME LAST TIME
BECAUSE YOU GOT LUCKY!

00:17:44.545 --> 00:17:46.280
WHAT'D YOU SAY!?

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:48.248
YOU KNOW, HE'S RIGHT!

00:17:48.248 --> 00:17:51.385
TRISTAN! WHOSE SIDE
ARE YOU ON, ANYWAY!

00:17:51.385 --> 00:17:53.020
JUST TELLIN' IT
LIKE IT IS!

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:55.889
I THINK I'LL TAKE IT EASY
ON YOU FOR NOW

00:17:55.889 --> 00:17:58.859
AND FINISH UP BY PLACING
ONE CARD FACEDOWN.

00:17:58.859 --> 00:18:01.895
SO LET'S SEE WHAT YOU GOT!

00:18:01.895 --> 00:18:04.731
I ONLY HAVE ONE MONSTA
IN MY HAND

00:18:04.731 --> 00:18:07.034
DAT CAN STAND UP
TA HIS LIZARDS!

00:18:07.034 --> 00:18:08.836
I SUMMON
PANTHER WARRIOR!

00:18:08.836 --> 00:18:15.475
AND I'LL PUT 'IM
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:18:15.475 --> 00:18:16.877
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS,

00:18:16.877 --> 00:18:18.545
MY PANTHER WARRIOR
CAN'T ATTACK

00:18:18.545 --> 00:18:20.848
UNLESS I SACRIFICE
ANOTHER MONSTER FIRST...

00:18:20.848 --> 00:18:22.916
SO LET'S SEE
WHAT I CAN DO.

00:18:22.916 --> 00:18:25.419
MY SCAPEGOATS'LL
DO DA TRICK!

00:18:25.419 --> 00:18:33.660
A'RIGHT! I'LL PLACE
ONE CARD FACEDOWN
AND THEN END MY TURN!

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:35.996
THIS NEXT INSECT
SHOULD LOOK FAMILIAR.

00:18:35.996 --> 00:18:40.968
IT'S PHEROMONE WASP!

00:18:40.968 --> 00:18:43.003
MY ONLY MONSTER
HAS BEEN INFECTED

00:18:43.003 --> 00:18:45.205
BY HIS PARASITE
CATERPILLAR!

00:18:45.205 --> 00:18:49.076
THAT MEANS
IT'S NO LONGER ABLE TO
DEFEND MY LIFE POINTS!

00:18:49.076 --> 00:18:51.879
GO, MY PHEROMONE WASP!

00:18:58.252 --> 00:18:59.586
YOU OK!?

00:18:59.586 --> 00:19:01.221
THAT'S NOT ALL!

00:19:01.221 --> 00:19:04.992
ATTACKING YOU DIRECTLY
JUST ACTIVATED
HIS SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:19:04.992 --> 00:19:07.327
WHICH MEANS MY WASP
ALLOWS ME TO SUMMON

00:19:07.327 --> 00:19:09.429
ANY INSECT MONSTER
IN MY DECK

00:19:09.429 --> 00:19:10.998
DIRECTLY TO THE FIELD!

00:19:10.998 --> 00:19:14.668
AND I KNOW JUST WHO
I'M GOING TO CHOOSE!

00:19:14.668 --> 00:19:17.437
I SUMMON A LEECH
KNOWN AS LEGHUL!

00:19:24.745 --> 00:19:30.717
THEN I'LL ACTIVATE
THE MAGIC CARD
INSECT BARRIER!

00:19:30.717 --> 00:19:32.819
HA HA HA HA!

00:19:32.819 --> 00:19:33.987
THIS BARRICADE
PROVIDES

00:19:33.987 --> 00:19:35.155
THE PERFECT
PROTECTION

00:19:35.155 --> 00:19:36.490
AGAINST ANY
INSECT MONSTER

00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:38.292
YOU TRY
AND ATTACK WITH!

00:19:38.292 --> 00:19:40.227
OH!
HUH?

00:19:40.227 --> 00:19:41.895
WHAT'S HE
TALKING ABOUT?

00:19:41.895 --> 00:19:44.898
YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY INSECT MONSTERS
IN YOUR DECK!

00:19:44.898 --> 00:19:46.400
THAT'S NOT TRUE!

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:49.002
TAKE A CLOSER LOOK
AT THE FIELD, TEA!

00:19:49.002 --> 00:19:52.873
YOUR CELTIC GUARDIAN'S
BEEN CONTAMINATED
BY MY PARASITE,

00:19:52.873 --> 00:19:54.274
WHICH MAKES HIM
PART INSECT!

00:19:54.274 --> 00:19:55.475
NO!

00:19:55.475 --> 00:19:58.478
HE'S SLOWLY TRANSFORMING
INTO A NEW CREATURE

00:19:58.478 --> 00:20:01.048
KNOWN AS POISON BUTTERFLY!

00:20:01.048 --> 00:20:04.885
AND EVEN THOUGH IT HAS
2,700 ATTACK POINTS...

00:20:04.885 --> 00:20:08.555
IT CAN'T HURT ME
THANKS TO MY INSECT BARRIER.

00:20:08.555 --> 00:20:11.158
AND SINCE IT CAN'T
ATTACK OR DEFEND,

00:20:11.158 --> 00:20:13.327
IT'S VIRTUALLY USELESS!

00:20:13.327 --> 00:20:14.728
HA HA HA HA!

00:20:14.728 --> 00:20:17.965
WEEVIL IS A MUCH
STRONGER DUELIST
THAN I REMEMBER.

00:20:17.965 --> 00:20:21.535
NOW THAT HE'S INFUSED
WITH THE POWER OF THE
ORICHALCOS...

00:20:21.535 --> 00:20:23.403
HE SEEMS UNSTOPPABLE!

00:20:23.403 --> 00:20:27.808
BUT I REFUSE TO LET HIM
STAND IN THE WAY OF
RESCUING YUGI!

00:20:27.808 --> 00:20:33.347
ALRIGHT! MY MOVE!

00:20:33.347 --> 00:20:35.282
HA HA HA HA!

00:20:35.282 --> 00:20:38.352
IT WON'T BE LONG NOW.

00:20:38.352 --> 00:20:42.189
THE SOUL OF THE PHARAOH
IS NEARLY IN MY GRASP.

00:20:42.189 --> 00:20:45.459
AFTER ALL, WE HAVE
THE PERFECT BAIT!

00:20:45.459 --> 00:20:47.861
HA HA HA HA!
