00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:32.074
THE GIRL WAS JUST
HOLDING ME BACK.

00:09:32.074 --> 00:09:34.678
Joey, voice-over:
DIS DARTZ GUY MUST PREY
ON PEOPLES' WEAKNESSES

00:09:34.678 --> 00:09:37.116
BY PROMISING THEM POWER.

00:09:37.116 --> 00:09:39.052
REX, HOLD ON.

00:09:39.052 --> 00:09:40.556
SAVE IT, PUNK.

00:09:40.556 --> 00:09:42.760
YOU'LL NEVER
STOP THIS DUEL.

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:47.669
NOW, HORNED SAURUS,
ATTACK!

00:09:47.669 --> 00:09:49.772
YOU JUST
TRIGGERED MY TRAP.

00:09:49.772 --> 00:09:55.249
ACTIVATE
MAGIC ARM SHIELD!

00:09:55.249 --> 00:09:57.387
GUESS AGAIN, WHEELER.

00:09:57.387 --> 00:09:59.189
I'VE GOT A TRAP, TOO.

00:09:59.189 --> 00:10:01.594
GO, JURASSIC HEART!

00:10:06.737 --> 00:10:08.006
WHAT WAS DAT?

00:10:08.006 --> 00:10:11.378
IT CANCELS OUT ANY TRAP
USED AGAINST A DINOSAUR,

00:10:11.378 --> 00:10:16.889
SO YOUR MONSTER'S HISTORY.

00:10:16.889 --> 00:10:18.893
BUT WAIT, THAT'S NOT ALL.

00:10:18.893 --> 00:10:20.362
GIANT REX, ATTACK!

00:10:20.362 --> 00:10:25.070
TRAMPLE HIS PUNY SCAPEGOAT.

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:28.544
NOW, GILASAURUS,
IT'S TIME TO SEE
WHAT YOU CAN DO.

00:10:33.686 --> 00:10:37.593
NEXT I'LL PLACE
ONE CARD FACE DOWN
AND END MY TURN.

00:10:37.593 --> 00:10:39.964
NOW YOU'RE
ONE ATTACK AWAY

00:10:39.964 --> 00:10:42.535
FROM LOSING
YOUR SOUL FOREVER.

00:10:49.643 --> 00:10:52.683
MY MOVE, REX.

00:10:52.683 --> 00:10:55.187
Joey, voice-over:
IT'S MY RED-EYES
BLACK DRAGON,

00:10:55.187 --> 00:10:57.825
THE CARD I WON FROM REX
BACK IN DUELIST KINGDOM.

00:10:57.825 --> 00:11:01.065
DIS COULD BE
JUST WHAT I NEEDED.

00:11:01.065 --> 00:11:05.005
Joey: I SACRIFICE
MY LAST SCAPEGOAT,

00:11:05.005 --> 00:11:09.012
AND DEN I ACTIVATE
STAR BLASTER.

00:11:09.012 --> 00:11:11.818
NOW ALL I HAFTA DO
IS ADD ONE
TO THE NUMBER I ROLL

00:11:11.818 --> 00:11:14.523
AND I CAN
SUMMON A MONSTER
WIT DAT MANY STARS.

00:11:23.205 --> 00:11:24.207
YES!

00:11:24.207 --> 00:11:25.442
READ IT AND WEEP, PAL.

00:11:25.442 --> 00:11:28.281
LAST I CHECKED,
6 PLUS 1 WAS 7,

00:11:28.281 --> 00:11:31.353
SO HERE COMES
A 7-STAR MONSTA.

00:11:31.353 --> 00:11:34.192
IT'S GONNA TAKE
MORE THAN DUMB LUCK
TO WIN THIS DUEL.

00:11:34.192 --> 00:11:36.396
YOU GOT A POINT THERE,
REX,

00:11:36.396 --> 00:11:42.240
BUT MAYBE DIS CAN HELP.

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.377
LOOK FAMILIAR,
DINO BRAIN?

00:11:44.377 --> 00:11:47.082
IT'S MY RED-EYES
BLACK DRAGON.

00:11:47.082 --> 00:11:49.887
YUP, HE'S BACK
AND BETTA DEN EVA,

00:11:49.887 --> 00:11:53.293
'CAUSE I'M
ENHANCING HIS POWER
WITH MY METALMORPH CARD.

00:11:53.293 --> 00:11:56.566
NOW 'OL RED-EYES
GETS A 300-POINT BOOST.

00:11:56.566 --> 00:11:58.202
PLUS, WHENEVER
HE ATTACKS A MONSTA,

00:11:58.202 --> 00:12:05.115
HE ABSORBS
HALF ITS STRENGTH.

00:12:05.115 --> 00:12:07.119
AND NOW FOR DA FUN PART.

00:12:07.119 --> 00:12:09.357
LET ME
SIMPLIFY DIS FOR YOU.

00:12:09.357 --> 00:12:12.997
WHEN MY DRAGON
BLOWS YOUR OLD FOSSIL
BACK TO DA STONE AGE,

00:12:12.997 --> 00:12:16.570
HIS POWER GROWS BY
HALF OF 2,500.

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:18.239
TAKE IT AWAY, RED-EYES.

00:12:23.983 --> 00:12:26.254
BACK INTO EXTINCTION
FOR YOU.

00:12:26.254 --> 00:12:30.695
NICE ONE, MAN.

00:12:30.695 --> 00:12:33.734
NEXT I'LL PLACE
ONE CARD FACE DOWN,

00:12:33.734 --> 00:12:39.712
AND DAT'S ALL FOR NOW.

00:12:39.712 --> 00:12:43.519
Weevil: MY INSECT ARMY
IS SLOWLY INFESTING
THE PLAYING FIELD.

00:12:43.519 --> 00:12:46.491
JUST A FEW MORE TURNS
AND YOU'RE BUG BAIT.

00:12:46.491 --> 00:12:48.027
WE'LL SEE.

00:12:48.027 --> 00:12:49.931
YEAH,
PEOPLE LIKE YOU
NEVER WIN.

00:12:49.931 --> 00:12:51.099
WHAT'S THIS?

00:12:51.099 --> 00:12:53.303
MORE COMMENTS
FROM THE PEANUT GALLERY?

00:12:53.303 --> 00:12:56.276
TELL ME, WHAT IS
A "PERSON LIKE ME"?

00:12:56.276 --> 00:12:58.513
YOU'RE A GREEDY,
POWER-HUNGRY WORM.

00:12:58.513 --> 00:13:00.516
WHAT'S THAT MAKE YOU?

00:13:00.516 --> 00:13:02.187
CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG,

00:13:02.187 --> 00:13:04.624
BUT AREN'T YOU THE ONE
WHO WANTED POWER?

00:13:04.624 --> 00:13:08.465
SO MUCH THAT YOU SOLD OUT
YOUR BEST FRIEND
JUST FOR A TASTE OF IT?

00:13:08.465 --> 00:13:10.602
WATCH IT BUG-BOY.

00:13:10.602 --> 00:13:13.908
I'M JUST TELLING YOU
WHAT I WITNESSED FIRSTHAND
DURING YOUR LAST DUEL,

00:13:13.908 --> 00:13:15.244
THAT'S ALL.

00:13:15.244 --> 00:13:18.383
YOU WERE DETERMINED TO WIN
AT ALL COSTS, WEREN'T YOU?

00:13:18.383 --> 00:13:21.389
SO YOU ACTIVATED
THE SEAL OF ORICHALCOS

00:13:21.389 --> 00:13:23.526
EVEN THOUGH YOU KNEW
YOU WERE ENDANGERING

00:13:23.526 --> 00:13:26.564
THE LIFE OF SOMEONE
CLOSE TO YOU.

00:13:26.564 --> 00:13:29.937
NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL
POWER-HUNGRY AND GREEDY.

00:13:29.937 --> 00:13:33.778
WELL, THIS TIME THE SEAL
AND ALL OF ITS POWERS
BELONG TO ME.

00:13:33.778 --> 00:13:35.447
HA HA HA!

00:13:35.447 --> 00:13:37.051
YOU'RE NOT
SCARING ANYONE.

00:13:37.051 --> 00:13:39.221
IF YOU THINK
YOU CAN WIN THIS DUEL

00:13:39.221 --> 00:13:40.891
BY PLAYING
YOUR LITTLE HEAD GAMES,

00:13:40.891 --> 00:13:42.995
THEN YOU ARE SORELY
MISTAKEN, WEEVIL.

00:13:42.995 --> 00:13:44.898
I'M TOO SMART FOR THAT.

00:13:44.898 --> 00:13:46.468
WHAT YOU REFER TO
AS HEAD GAMES

00:13:46.468 --> 00:13:48.504
I CALL OPENING YOU UP
TO THE TRUTH.

00:13:48.504 --> 00:13:50.508
AND WHETHER
YOU REALIZE IT OR NOT,

00:13:50.508 --> 00:13:54.082
IT'S CAUSING YOU
TO DOUBT YOURSELF.

00:13:54.082 --> 00:13:56.186
NOT THAT I BLAME YOU.

00:13:56.186 --> 00:13:59.391
I'D BE SHAKING IN FEAR ALSO,

00:13:59.391 --> 00:14:02.664
IF I WERE THE ONE
ABOUT TO LOSE HIS SOUL,
THAT IS.

00:14:02.664 --> 00:14:04.166
HA HA HA!

00:14:11.377 --> 00:14:13.181
NOW DAT RED-EYES
IS HERE,

00:14:13.181 --> 00:14:14.650
YOU'RE AN
ENDANGERED SPECIES.

00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:16.353
IT WAS NICE KNOWIN' YA,
RAPTOR.

00:14:16.353 --> 00:14:19.992
YOU'VE GOT SOME NERVE
USING THAT AGAINST ME.

00:14:19.992 --> 00:14:21.796
THAT DRAGON
WAS MY BEST CARD

00:14:21.796 --> 00:14:24.234
UNTIL YOU TOOK IT
AWAY FROM ME.

00:14:24.234 --> 00:14:25.837
HEY, RELAX.

00:14:25.837 --> 00:14:29.076
I WON THAT CARD
FAIR AND SQUARE.

00:14:29.076 --> 00:14:30.746
GO, TIME WIZARD!

00:14:30.746 --> 00:14:34.754
FOSSILIZE HIS DRAGON!

00:14:34.754 --> 00:14:36.223
RED-EYES?

00:14:36.223 --> 00:14:38.293
YOU FEELING ALRIGHT?

00:14:43.403 --> 00:14:45.940
YOU'VE RUINED MY LIFE.

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:49.447
I USED TO BE A REGIONAL
DUEL MONSTERS CHAMPION.

00:14:49.447 --> 00:14:52.553
AT ONE TIME,
WEEVIL AND I WERE
THE MOST FAMOUS DUELISTS

00:14:52.553 --> 00:14:54.089
IN THE WHOLE COUNTRY.

00:14:54.089 --> 00:14:56.994
WE COULDN'T WALK ONE BLOCK
WITHOUT BEING RECOGNIZED.

00:14:56.994 --> 00:14:58.964
Man: I WANT
THEIR AUTOGRAPHS!

00:14:58.964 --> 00:15:01.269
HEY, DOES ANYONE
HAVE A PEN?

00:15:01.269 --> 00:15:03.406
Second man:
I CAN'T WAIT TO TELL
MY MOM I SAW THEM.

00:15:03.406 --> 00:15:06.779
I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY'RE
WALKIN' DOWN THE STREET
LIKE REGULAR GUYS.

00:15:06.779 --> 00:15:07.914
Fourth man: YEAH.

00:15:07.914 --> 00:15:11.253
YOU'D THINK THEY'D HAVE
A LIMO OR SOMETHING.

00:15:11.253 --> 00:15:14.460
Weevil:
SOON EVERYONE IN THE WORLD
WILL ENVY ME.

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:16.296
I'LL BE BACK ON TOP,

00:15:16.296 --> 00:15:20.204
JUST LIKE I WAS
BEFORE YOU DEFEATED ME
IN DUELIST KINGDOM.

00:15:20.204 --> 00:15:23.175
I'LL BE WEEVIL UNDERWOOD,
THE NEW KING OF GAMES.

00:15:23.175 --> 00:15:25.713
IT HAS A NICE RING,
DOESN'T IT?

00:15:25.713 --> 00:15:30.522
I ALMOST FORGOT
WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO BE
WORSHIPED AND ADORED.

00:15:30.522 --> 00:15:32.726
Boy: WEEVIL? REX?

00:15:32.726 --> 00:15:34.396
COULD I HAVE
YOUR AUTOGRAPHS?

00:15:34.396 --> 00:15:35.999
I'M A HUGE FAN
OF YOUR WORK.

00:15:35.999 --> 00:15:37.635
YOU TALKIN' TA US?

00:15:37.635 --> 00:15:39.973
WELL, OF COURSE HE IS.

00:15:39.973 --> 00:15:42.077
NOW YOU DO
THE HONORS, REX.

00:15:42.077 --> 00:15:43.312
Rex: SURE.

00:15:43.312 --> 00:15:44.581
THANKS A LOT.

00:15:44.581 --> 00:15:45.650
YOU GUYS ROCK.

00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:47.219
AH-AH-AH.

00:15:47.219 --> 00:15:50.826
WE'RE NOT GIVING
THESE THINGS AWAY
FOR FREE, KID.

00:15:50.826 --> 00:15:53.598
IT'LL COST YOU
YOUR RAREST CARD.

00:15:53.598 --> 00:15:57.372
WHAT? MY CARD?

00:15:57.372 --> 00:15:59.275
AH, THANKS...

00:15:59.275 --> 00:16:00.443
I THINK.

00:16:00.443 --> 00:16:03.917
[LAUGHING]

00:16:03.917 --> 00:16:06.789
Rex: UNFORTUNATELY,
MY FAME DIDN'T LAST .

00:16:06.789 --> 00:16:08.358
I BECAME A JOKE.

00:16:08.358 --> 00:16:09.961
HOW COULD I LOSE TA YOU?

00:16:09.961 --> 00:16:12.165
WHATTA YA MEAN BY DAT?

00:16:12.165 --> 00:16:14.403
I WAS SUPPOSED TO WIN
THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS

00:16:14.403 --> 00:16:16.307
DUELING TOURNAMENT
EVER THROWN

00:16:16.307 --> 00:16:18.543
AND INSTEAD
I WAS DEFEATED
BY A ROOKIE.

00:16:18.543 --> 00:16:20.914
I WENT IN AS A CHAMPION,

00:16:20.914 --> 00:16:22.918
BUT I CAME OUT
AS THE LAUGHING STOCK

00:16:22.918 --> 00:16:25.222
OF THE ENTIRE
DUELING WORLD.

00:16:25.222 --> 00:16:29.163
I WAS KNOCKED
OUTTA THE TOURNAMENT
IN ROUND ONE.

00:16:29.163 --> 00:16:30.198
Man: HEY, CHECK IT OUT.

00:16:30.198 --> 00:16:34.573
ITS BUG BOY AND DINO DORK.

00:16:34.573 --> 00:16:38.714
Second man: CAN YOU
BELIEVE THOSE TWO

00:16:38.714 --> 00:16:40.551
Rex, voice-over: SOME FANS.

00:16:40.551 --> 00:16:44.625
THE SECOND WE LOST,
THEY ALL DISAPPEARED.

00:16:44.625 --> 00:16:47.129
Weevil: THIS STINKS.

00:16:47.129 --> 00:16:52.138
WE LOST EVERYTHING
TO A COUPLE 'A NEWCOMERS.

00:16:52.138 --> 00:16:54.209
NO MORE MOVIE PREMIERES.

00:16:54.209 --> 00:16:56.213
Rex: NO MORE
PRIVATE PARTIES.

00:16:56.213 --> 00:16:58.283
Man: HEY,

00:16:58.283 --> 00:16:59.486
WHO'S ASKIN'?

00:16:59.486 --> 00:17:03.259

00:17:03.259 --> 00:17:05.397
IS THIS THE CARD
THEY TOOK FROM YA?

00:17:05.397 --> 00:17:06.699
YUP, THAT'S THE ONE.

00:17:06.699 --> 00:17:08.769
THANKS AGAIN.

00:17:08.769 --> 00:17:11.206
Man: WHAJA DO WITH
THOSE AUTOGRAPHS ANYWAY?

00:17:11.206 --> 00:17:13.644
Boy: PLEASE,
I COULDN'T EVEN GIVE
THOSE THINGS AWAY.

00:17:13.644 --> 00:17:16.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:21.659
Rex, voice-over:
THAT WAS THE LOWEST
POINT OF MY LIFE.

00:17:21.659 --> 00:17:24.932
SINCE THEN,
IT'S BEEN ONE BAD DAY
AFTER ANOTHER.

00:17:24.932 --> 00:17:28.137
I WAS A HOUSEHOLD NAME
AND NOW I'M NOTHING.

00:17:28.137 --> 00:17:32.245
AND I OWE IT ALL TO YOU,
JOEY WHEELER.

00:17:32.245 --> 00:17:33.681
ARE YOU FINISHED YET?

00:17:33.681 --> 00:17:36.687
I'M SICK 'A HEARIN'
YOUR SOB STORY.

00:17:36.687 --> 00:17:38.924
I'M SUPPOSTA
FEEL BAD FOR YOU

00:17:38.924 --> 00:17:41.228
JUST 'CAUSE YOU THINK
IT'S MY FAULT

00:17:41.228 --> 00:17:42.865
YOU'RE NOT POPULAR
ANYMORE?

00:17:42.865 --> 00:17:44.468
GET A LIFE, WILL YA?

00:17:44.468 --> 00:17:45.870
THAT'S THE POINT.

00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:47.440
WHAT'S DA POINT?

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.043
DAT YOU DON'T
HAVE A LIFE?

00:17:49.043 --> 00:17:50.412
EXACTLY!

00:17:50.412 --> 00:17:52.014
YOU TOOK MY LIFE
AWAY FROM ME

I REALIZED A LONG TIME AGO
THAT BEING MR. NICE GUY
GETS YOU NOWHERE.

00:18:41.639 --> 00:18:45.880
THAT'S WHY I DECIDED
TO TEAM UP WITH DARTZ
AND HIS GANG.

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:49.955
THEY GAVE ME SOMETHING
I COULD NEVER GET
JUST BY PLAYING FAIR--
