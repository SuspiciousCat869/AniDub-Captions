00:09:33.278 --> 00:09:36.651
THE WORLD'S BEEN LIKE THIS
FOR THE LAST 10,000 YEARS.

00:09:36.651 --> 00:09:38.921
WE USED TO LIVE IN PARADISE,

00:09:38.921 --> 00:09:41.192
BUT THEN THE ANCIENT STONE
SHOWED UP.

00:09:41.192 --> 00:09:44.666
WHAT ANCIENT STONE
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

00:09:44.666 --> 00:09:47.037
DON'T YOU KNOW?

00:09:47.037 --> 00:09:50.143
I'M TALKING ABOUT
THE STONE OF ORICHALCOS!

00:09:50.143 --> 00:09:52.947
IT CAME TO TEST US,
AND MOST OF US FAILED.

00:09:52.947 --> 00:09:54.918
THE STONE
UNLOCKED THE DARKNESS

00:09:54.918 --> 00:09:57.656
THAT WAS BURIED
IN THE HEARTS OF MANKIND.

00:09:57.656 --> 00:10:00.194
ONLY A FEW
TURNED OUT TO BE PURE.

00:10:00.194 --> 00:10:03.434
A HUGE BATTLE BROKE OUT
BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL,

00:10:03.434 --> 00:10:06.105
AND IN THE END,
THE EVIL SIDE WON.

00:10:06.105 --> 00:10:08.009
WHOEVER TOLD YOU
THAT STORY

00:10:08.009 --> 00:10:09.879
IS LYING TO YOU.

00:10:09.879 --> 00:10:12.116
THE ONLY EVIL
IS AROUND YOUR NECK!

00:10:12.116 --> 00:10:14.722
THAT STONE
IS NOTHING
BUT BAD NEWS!

[LAUGHING]

00:10:18.695 --> 00:10:20.933
YOU'VE GOT IT WRONG.

00:10:20.933 --> 00:10:22.535
THE STONE OF ORICHALCOS

00:10:22.535 --> 00:10:24.740
SIMPLY SHOWS US
THE TRUTH, PHARAOH--

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:26.643
THAT THE MAJORITY
OF THE WORLD

00:10:26.643 --> 00:10:28.213
IS HEARTLESS AND EVIL.

00:10:28.213 --> 00:10:29.615
YOU'RE WRONG!

00:10:29.615 --> 00:10:31.452
HOW WOULD YOU KNOW?

00:10:31.452 --> 00:10:33.890
I HEARD YOUR MEMORIES
WERE ERASED!

00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:36.094
IF THAT'S TRUE,
HOW DO YOU KNOW

00:10:36.094 --> 00:10:37.797
YOU WEREN'T
AN EVIL PHARAOH!?

00:10:37.797 --> 00:10:39.968
THAT CAN'T BE!

00:10:44.839 --> 00:10:48.312
I MAY NOT REMEMBER
MUCH ABOUT MY DAYS
AS PHARAOH,

00:10:48.312 --> 00:10:51.017
BUT I KNOW THAT
I ONCE SAVED MANKIND.

00:10:51.017 --> 00:10:53.455
WELL, THE PEOPLE
YOU SAVED WERE EVIL,

00:10:53.455 --> 00:10:54.991
WHICH MEANS
YOU ARE, TOO!

00:10:54.991 --> 00:10:56.394
THAT'S NOT TRUE!

00:10:56.394 --> 00:10:59.199
5,000 YEARS BEFORE
YOU RULED AS KING,

00:10:59.199 --> 00:11:01.303
THE STONE OF ORICHALCOS
APPEARED...

00:11:01.303 --> 00:11:04.910
AND NEVER LEFT!

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:07.848
THE WORLD WAS DIVIDED
INTO TWO SIDES:

00:11:07.848 --> 00:11:11.522
THE PURE OF HEART
AND THOSE RULED BY DARKNESS.

00:11:11.522 --> 00:11:15.596
THE TWO SIDES
FACED OFF IN THE MOST
DEVASTATING BATTLE

00:11:15.596 --> 00:11:18.735
THE WORLD'S EVER SEEN.

00:11:18.735 --> 00:11:21.140
WE'RE HERE
TO CONTINUE THAT FIGHT

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:22.909
AND MAKE SURE
OUR SIDE WINS!

00:11:22.909 --> 00:11:25.514
AND WHILE WE MAY BE
OUTNUMBERED,

00:11:25.514 --> 00:11:27.985
WE HAVE TWO THINGS
YOU DON'T:

00:11:27.985 --> 00:11:30.089
THE POWER
OF THE ORICHALCOS

00:11:30.089 --> 00:11:32.160
AND THE GREAT LEVIATHAN!

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:35.600
THEREFORE, WE CAN
CAPTURE THE SOULS OF MAN

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:39.908
AND OFFER THEM
TO THE MOST POWERFUL
BEAST THAT EVER LIVED.

00:11:39.908 --> 00:11:42.312
ONLY THEN WILL
THE WORLD RETURN

00:11:42.312 --> 00:11:44.048
TO THE WAY IT WAS--

00:11:44.048 --> 00:11:47.188
A PEACEFUL PLACE
WITH A WORTHY LEADER.

00:11:47.188 --> 00:11:49.959
I'M TELLING YOU,
YOU'VE BEEN BRAINWASHED!

00:11:49.959 --> 00:11:51.696
TAKE A LOOK AROUND.

00:11:51.696 --> 00:11:54.167
IF THINGS CONTINUE
THE WAY THEY ARE,

00:11:54.167 --> 00:11:57.473
THE ENTIRE PLANET'S GONNA
LOOK LIKE THIS DESERT:

00:11:57.473 --> 00:11:59.510
DESOLATE, CRUMBLING,

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:02.716
AND VOID OF
ANY SIGNS OF LIFE!

00:12:02.716 --> 00:12:04.720
BUT THAT'S
NOT GONNA HAPPEN,

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:08.227
BECAUSE I'LL SEE TO IT
THAT JUSTICE IS SERVED.

00:12:08.227 --> 00:12:09.896
AND YOU'RE GONNA HELP ME.

[LAUGHING]

00:12:11.465 --> 00:12:14.405
YA SEE, PHARAOH,
AFTER 5,000 YEARS,

00:12:14.405 --> 00:12:15.874
YOUR SPIRIT DID COME BACK

00:12:15.874 --> 00:12:17.443
SO YOU COULD
SAVE THE WORLD...

00:12:17.443 --> 00:12:20.015
BY SURRENDERING YOUR SOUL!

00:12:20.015 --> 00:12:21.751
NO, THAT'S A LIE.

00:12:21.751 --> 00:12:23.822
ENOUGH! I'M SICK
OF HEARING YOU

00:12:23.822 --> 00:12:26.260
JUSTIFY
YOUR EVIL PLAN!

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.497
I'M AFRAID
IT ISN'T MY PLAN.

00:12:28.497 --> 00:12:40.052
I'M CARRYING OUT
THE WISHES OF MY MASTER.

00:12:40.052 --> 00:12:43.559
JUST WHO IS THIS MASTER
OF YOURS, RAFAEL?

00:12:43.559 --> 00:12:45.428
WELL, FOR STARTERS,

00:12:45.428 --> 00:12:47.733
HE'S A BETTER LEADER
THAN YOU WERE.

00:12:47.733 --> 00:12:49.002
THAT'S RIGHT, PHARAOH.

00:12:49.002 --> 00:12:52.274
MY MASTER TOLD ME
ALL ABOUT YOUR HISTORY

00:12:52.274 --> 00:12:54.011
AS THE KING OF EGYPT;

00:12:54.011 --> 00:12:57.017
HOW YOU RULED
AS AN EVIL DICTATOR

00:12:57.017 --> 00:12:59.221
USING THE POWER
OF THE SHADOW REALM

00:12:59.221 --> 00:13:01.291
TO CONTROL YOUR SUBJECTS.

00:13:01.291 --> 00:13:04.397
WAKE UP. HE LIED.

HOW WOULD YOU KNOW?

00:13:06.334 --> 00:13:08.605
YOU HAVE NO MEMORY
OF YOUR PAST.

00:13:08.605 --> 00:13:10.541
SO ISN'T IT POSSIBLE
THAT YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE

00:13:10.541 --> 00:13:12.445
FOR THE DESTRUCTION
OF EGYPT?!

00:13:12.445 --> 00:13:14.883
THINK ABOUT IT!

00:13:14.883 --> 00:13:16.987
IT CAN'T BE.

00:13:16.987 --> 00:13:19.091
I KNOW I WAS
A WORTHY PHARAOH.

I'M THE ONE WHO LOCKED
THE DARK MAGIC AWAY!

00:13:22.296 --> 00:13:24.902
SO YOU BELIEVE...

00:13:24.902 --> 00:13:27.038
BUT IF YOU TAKE
A CLOSER LOOK AT YOURSELF,

00:13:27.038 --> 00:13:28.909
YOU'LL DISCOVER THE TRUTH.

00:13:28.909 --> 00:13:34.519
YOUR HEART IS DARK,
AND I'M ABOUT TO PROVE IT.

FIRST, I'LL PLACE
ONE CARD FACEDOWN.

00:13:37.424 --> 00:13:39.829
THEN I'LL ACTIVATE
THIS MAGIC CARD!

00:13:39.829 --> 00:13:41.799
IT'S CALLED EXCHANGE!

00:13:41.799 --> 00:13:43.970
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:46.274
NORMALLY, EXCHANGE
ALLOWS BOTH OF US

00:13:46.274 --> 00:13:48.946
TO PICK A CARD FROM
OUR OPPONENT'S HAND.

00:13:48.946 --> 00:13:50.683
BUT YOU'LL NOTICE
WE EACH HAVE

00:13:50.683 --> 00:13:52.419
ONLY ONE CARD LEFT.

00:13:52.419 --> 00:13:55.825

WE SWITCH CARDS.

WAS USELESS TO YOU ANYWAY,

IT KNOWS WHO
THE EVIL ONES ARE.

00:18:23.719 --> 00:18:27.092
REMEMBER MY PURITY
OF THE CEMETERY'S
STILL IN EFFECT!

00:18:27.092 --> 00:18:31.266
SO YOU LOSE
600 LIFE POINTS!

00:18:31.266 --> 00:18:33.971
NOW YOU HAVE
ONE TURN LEFT.

00:18:33.971 --> 00:18:36.309
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO SAVE YOURSELF,

00:18:36.309 --> 00:18:38.245
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

00:18:38.245 --> 00:18:39.982
NOW, PLAY THE CARD
I GAVE YOU!

00:18:39.982 --> 00:18:42.454
Yugi: NO, PHARAOH!
PLEASE!

00:18:42.454 --> 00:18:47.362
THERE'S ANOTHER WAY
OUT OF THIS.

00:18:47.362 --> 00:18:49.233
IF I LOSE NOW,

00:18:49.233 --> 00:18:51.738
THEN TWO WORLDS
WILL BE DESTROYED!

00:18:51.738 --> 00:18:53.942
I WON'T LOSE
THIS DUEL!

00:18:53.942 --> 00:18:56.713
I'LL TAKE YOU DOWN,
RAFAEL!

00:18:56.713 --> 00:19:00.286
SO I ACTIVATE
MY CARD OF SANCTITY!

00:19:00.286 --> 00:19:02.491
BOTH OF US MUST DRAW
FROM OUR DECKS

00:19:02.491 --> 00:19:05.129
UNTIL WE HAVE
6 CARDS
IN OUR HANDS!

00:19:05.129 --> 00:19:08.034
NOW YOU'RE JUST STALLING.

00:19:13.945 --> 00:19:15.681
I'M OUT OF OPTIONS.

00:19:15.681 --> 00:19:17.585
THERE'S ONLY
ONE CARD IN MY HAND

00:19:17.585 --> 00:19:22.294
THAT CAN FREE MY DRAGON
SO I CAN WIN THE DUEL.

00:19:22.294 --> 00:19:28.772
I MUST PLAY
THE SEAL OF ORICHALCOS!

00:19:28.772 --> 00:19:31.010
Yugi: PHARAOH! NO!!

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:32.680
LET GO.

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:34.249
NO. YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING!

00:19:34.249 --> 00:19:35.418
LET GO!

00:19:35.418 --> 00:19:36.821
LISTEN TO ME!

00:19:36.821 --> 00:19:38.390
THIS CARD IS
AFFECTING YOUR MIND!

00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:40.394
WE'RE GOING
TO LOSE THE DUEL!

00:19:40.394 --> 00:19:42.531
CAN'T YOU SEE!?
TRUST ME!

00:19:42.531 --> 00:19:44.468
IT'S THE ONLY WAY,
YUGI!

00:19:44.468 --> 00:19:48.909
WE MUST DO THIS.
NOW, LET ME GO!

00:19:48.909 --> 00:19:51.414
PLEASE, DON'T PLAY
THAT CARD.

00:19:51.414 --> 00:19:58.126
NOW I ACTIVATE
THE SEAL OF ORICHALCOS!

00:19:58.126 --> 00:19:59.830
EXCELLENT.

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:10.315
WHAT HAVE I DONE?

00:20:10.315 --> 00:20:14.857
[SCREAMING]

00:20:14.857 --> 00:20:17.262
NO!

00:20:24.676 --> 00:20:26.812
Joey: DO YOU GUYS
SEE WHAT I SEE!?

00:20:26.812 --> 00:20:28.449
IS THAT LIGHT
WHAT I THINK IT IS!?

00:20:28.449 --> 00:20:32.089
THE SEAL OF ORICHALCOS!

00:20:32.089 --> 00:20:33.993
Rafael:
NICE WORK, PHARAOH!

00:20:33.993 --> 00:20:35.629
I KNEW YOU HAD IT IN YOU.

00:20:35.629 --> 00:20:37.499
NOW LET'S SEE
WHAT THE ORICHALCOS

00:20:37.499 --> 00:20:39.269
REVEALS ABOUT YOU.

00:20:39.269 --> 00:20:42.265
ARE YOU GOOD
OR ARE YOU EVIL?

00:20:45.335 --> 00:20:47.937
SO TELL ME,
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

00:20:47.937 --> 00:20:49.772
