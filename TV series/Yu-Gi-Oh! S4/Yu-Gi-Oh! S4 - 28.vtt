Dartz: GREAT LEVIATHAN...

00:09:03.384 --> 00:09:06.356
I SENSE THE ARRIVAL
OF POWERFUL SOUL.

00:09:06.356 --> 00:09:10.097
LET'S SEE WHO, SHALL WE?

00:09:10.097 --> 00:09:11.200
WELL...

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.471
LOOK WHAT THE ORICHALCOS
DRAGGED IN.

00:09:13.471 --> 00:09:15.643
MY FORMER EMPLOYEE.

00:09:15.643 --> 00:09:18.115
NOW IT'S MS. VALENTINE'S TURN

00:09:18.115 --> 00:09:19.818
TO SEND ME A SOUL...

00:09:19.818 --> 00:09:21.623
OR TO GIVE UP HER OWN.

00:09:21.623 --> 00:09:24.729

00:09:29.873 --> 00:09:31.076
COME BACK...

00:09:31.076 --> 00:09:32.846
VALON...

00:09:32.846 --> 00:09:34.416
Joey: IT'S TOO LATE.

00:09:34.416 --> 00:09:39.360
THE ORICHALCOS
HAS HIM NOW.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.730
Valon: I KNOW THAT DEEP DOWN

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:43.135
YOU FEEL THE SAME
WAY I DO, MAI.

00:09:43.135 --> 00:09:44.905
THAT'S WHY WE
FOUND EACH OTHER.

00:09:44.905 --> 00:09:46.409
YOU'RE JUST LIKE ME--

00:09:46.409 --> 00:09:49.281
LONELY AND MISUNDERSTOOD.

00:09:49.281 --> 00:09:53.457
THAT'S WHY WE
NEED EACH OTHER.

00:09:53.457 --> 00:09:56.463
HEY, MAI...

00:09:56.463 --> 00:09:58.435
WE'LL GET HIM BACK.

00:09:58.435 --> 00:10:00.339
HOW COULD HE DO THIS?

00:10:00.339 --> 00:10:02.009
VALON'S THE ONE
WHO TOLD ME

00:10:02.009 --> 00:10:03.880
YOU HAVE TO DUEL
FOR YOURSELF.

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:05.583
THEN HE TURNS AROUND
AND FIGHTS YOU

00:10:05.583 --> 00:10:07.086
TO PROTECT ME?

00:10:07.086 --> 00:10:08.991
HOW PATHETIC.

00:10:08.991 --> 00:10:10.426
HE DESERVED THIS.

00:10:10.426 --> 00:10:11.897
WHAT?

00:10:11.897 --> 00:10:12.999
LOOK, MAI,

00:10:12.999 --> 00:10:15.104
VALON REALIZED WHAT
HE TOLD YOU WAS WRONG.

00:10:15.104 --> 00:10:17.943
HE FOUND OUT
WHAT DUELING
IS REALLY ABOUT--

00:10:17.943 --> 00:10:19.680
DETERMINATION AND HEART.

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:20.782
HMM!

00:10:20.782 --> 00:10:22.553
HE FOUGHT LIKE
A TRUE DUELIST TODAY.

00:10:22.553 --> 00:10:25.960
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED
TO DESTROY HIM.

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.062
HOLD ON!

00:10:27.062 --> 00:10:28.265
VALON MAY HAVE
ANNOYED ME...

00:10:28.265 --> 00:10:29.835
BUT NO ONE
DESERVES

00:10:29.835 --> 00:10:31.471
TO HAVE THEIR
SOUL TAKEN AWAY

00:10:31.471 --> 00:10:32.607
AND THEN HELD CAPTIVE

00:10:32.607 --> 00:10:34.679
BY SOME POWER-HUNGRY
PSYCHOPATH!

00:10:34.679 --> 00:10:36.216
I DON'T CARE
WHO THEY ARE!

00:10:36.216 --> 00:10:37.986
HA.

00:10:37.986 --> 00:10:39.255
YOU KNOW WHAT,
MAI...

00:10:39.255 --> 00:10:41.259
I REALIZE
SOMETHING NOW.

00:10:41.259 --> 00:10:43.331
AS LONG AS THAT
ORICHALCOS THING

00:10:43.331 --> 00:10:44.833
HAS CONTROL
OVER YOUR MIND,

00:10:44.833 --> 00:10:47.673
I'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO
TALK ANY SENSE INTO YOU!

00:10:47.673 --> 00:10:49.711
AS A MATTER OF FACT,

00:10:49.711 --> 00:10:50.880
THE ONLY WAY I
CAN SAVE YOU

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.383
AT THIS POINT
IS TO DUEL YOU!

00:10:52.383 --> 00:10:53.820
SO, WHAT DO YOU SAY!?

00:10:59.963 --> 00:11:02.602
I SEE. SO,
YOU BEAT THIS LOSER

00:11:02.602 --> 00:11:04.139
AND NOW IT'S GONE
TO YOUR HEAD?

00:11:04.139 --> 00:11:05.943
IT ISN'T LIKE THAT, MAI.

00:11:05.943 --> 00:11:07.780
WHY ELSE WOULD YOU
BE DUMB ENOUGH

00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:09.417
TO CHALLENGE ME
TO A DUEL?

00:11:09.417 --> 00:11:11.020
YOU SHOULD HAVE
LEARNED YOUR LESSON

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:13.893
FROM OUR LAST MATCH!

00:11:13.893 --> 00:11:15.663
THE ONLY WAY I CAN
GET THROUGH TO YOU...

00:11:15.663 --> 00:11:17.568
IS BY DUELING YOU!

00:11:17.568 --> 00:11:20.541
IF YOU SAY SO.

00:11:20.541 --> 00:11:24.950
LET'S DUEL!

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:26.721
WE'VE SEARCHED
EVERY BLOCK!

00:11:26.721 --> 00:11:28.791
AND NO SIGN OF JOEY!

00:11:28.791 --> 00:11:30.897
MAYBE THAT TRACKING
SYSTEM SCREWED UP.

00:11:30.897 --> 00:11:34.504
WE NEED A NEW PLAN!

00:11:34.504 --> 00:11:36.943
Tristan:
YOU ALL RIGHT, YUGI?

00:11:36.943 --> 00:11:38.579
THIS WAY! QUICKLY!

00:11:38.579 --> 00:11:40.016
YUGI, WAIT!

00:11:48.801 --> 00:11:52.142
WE'RE ABOUT A BLOCK
AWAY FROM PARADIUS
HEADQUARTERS.

00:11:52.142 --> 00:11:54.046
AND SO FAR,
THE COAST IS CLEAR.

00:11:54.046 --> 00:11:55.749
I THINK YOU
MAY HAVE SPOKEN

00:11:55.749 --> 00:11:57.420
A LITTLE TOO
SOON, MOKUBA.

00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:59.524
'CAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE
WE'VE GOT SOME COMPANY.

00:12:13.989 --> 00:12:16.427
IS THERE SOMETHING I
CAN HELP YOU BOYS WITH?

00:12:16.427 --> 00:12:17.630
BE CAREFUL!

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:19.667
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU FREAKS ARE

00:12:19.667 --> 00:12:21.504
OR IF YOU EVEN
EXIST AT ALL...

00:12:21.504 --> 00:12:24.110
BUT I DON'T HAVE ANY
TIME TO PLAY GAMES.

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:27.484
SO, I'D SUGGEST
YOU BACK OFF!

YOU GO FIRST, MAI!

BIG MISTAKE!
WATCH THIS!

00:12:39.176 --> 00:12:42.049
I CALL MY CYBER HARPIE
TO THE FIELD

00:12:42.049 --> 00:12:44.587
IN ATTACK MODE,
OF COURSE!

00:12:44.587 --> 00:12:46.491
THAT'S ALL FOR NOW.

00:12:46.491 --> 00:12:49.732

SAY THAT.

00:12:51.469 --> 00:12:53.406

DID A NUMBER ON ME.

I'M EXHAUSTED!

00:12:54.475 --> 00:12:56.379
I CAN BARELY DRAW
MY CARD.

YOUR HARPIES BUSY.

WITHOUT YOUR HELP.

DIDN'T YOU LEARN?

00:13:53.501 --> 00:13:54.938
IF YOU CRAMP MY STYLE,

00:13:54.938 --> 00:13:56.541
YOU END UP IN
A WORLD OF HURT!

00:13:56.541 --> 00:13:59.481

EVERYTHING NOW, MAI.

HUH?

00:14:00.717 --> 00:14:03.121
YOU FORGOT WHAT
DUELING'S ALL ABOUT.

00:14:03.121 --> 00:14:04.625
SO, I'M HEAR TO
REMIND YOU ABOUT

TEACH ME A LESSON

WITH ANOTHER CYBER HARPIE
IN ATTACK MODE!

THEN I'LL PLAY MY

00:16:22.819 --> 00:16:23.922
I WAS LETTING
HER BEAT ME

00:16:23.922 --> 00:16:25.992
'CAUSE I DIDN'T WANT
HER TO GET HURT.

00:16:25.992 --> 00:16:28.598
BUT IT COMPLETELY
BACKFIRED.

00:16:28.598 --> 00:16:32.874
SO, THIS TIME,
I'M GIVING IT ALL I GOT!

00:16:32.874 --> 00:16:37.116
HERE I GO, MAI.

00:16:37.116 --> 00:16:39.555
I SACRIFICE
FLAME SWORDSMAN!

00:16:39.555 --> 00:16:42.161
SO I CAN SUMMON
CYBER-TECH ALLIGATOR

00:16:42.161 --> 00:16:43.830
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:16:49.943 --> 00:16:51.046
HUH?

00:16:51.046 --> 00:16:55.956
CYBER-TECH ALLIGATOR,
ATTACK CYBER HARPIE!

00:16:55.956 --> 00:16:56.992
[GROWL]

00:16:56.992 --> 00:17:01.902
[SCREECH]

00:17:01.902 --> 00:17:03.906
[CHUCKLING]

00:17:03.906 --> 00:17:05.577
NOT TOO BAD.

00:17:05.577 --> 00:17:06.747
HUH?

00:17:06.747 --> 00:17:09.486
FINALLY, YOU'RE GIVING
ME A REAL CHALLENGE!

00:17:09.486 --> 00:17:11.991
BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO DO BETTER THAN THAT!

00:17:11.991 --> 00:17:14.997
'CAUSE BEFORE MY AERO NAIL
GOES TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:17:14.997 --> 00:17:19.673
IT'S TRANSFERRING ITS
POWER TO MY OTHER HARPY!

00:17:19.673 --> 00:17:20.777
FINE!

00:17:20.777 --> 00:17:22.480
I PLACE ONE
CARD FACE DOWN!

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:24.150
GIVE ME YOUR
BEST SHOT!

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:25.486
YOU'RE PRETTY CONFIDENT

00:17:25.486 --> 00:17:26.923
FOR SOMEONE WHO'S
ABOUT TO LOSE!

00:17:26.923 --> 00:17:28.426
NOW, STAND BACK!

00:17:28.426 --> 00:17:31.299
MY MOVE!

00:17:31.299 --> 00:17:33.303
I DREW IT.

00:17:33.303 --> 00:17:34.907
OH, NO!

00:17:34.907 --> 00:17:40.852
YUP! THE SEAL
OF ORICHALCOS!

00:17:40.852 --> 00:17:42.022
[GROAN]

00:17:42.022 --> 00:17:43.859

OH, MAN! JOEY!

00:18:00.026 --> 00:18:02.365
IT'S THE SEAL
OF ORICHALCOS.

00:18:02.365 --> 00:18:04.436
WE ALL KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

00:18:04.436 --> 00:18:06.541
YEAH, IT MEANS
SOMEONE'S GONNA
LOSE THEIR SOUL.

00:18:06.541 --> 00:18:07.576
THEN LET'S GO!

00:18:07.576 --> 00:18:09.247
[GRUNTING]

00:18:17.865 --> 00:18:19.903
WE'RE BOTH LOCKED
IN THE SEAL...

00:18:19.903 --> 00:18:22.141
AND ONLY ONE OF
US WILL ESCAPE!

00:18:22.141 --> 00:18:24.646
NO ONE CAN COME
TO YOUR RESCUE NOW.

00:18:24.646 --> 00:18:26.049
IT'S JUST YOU, ME,

00:18:26.049 --> 00:18:27.719
AND THE MOST
POWERFUL MAGIC CARD

00:18:27.719 --> 00:18:29.557
THAT'S EVER
BEEN CREATED!

00:18:29.557 --> 00:18:30.659
I KNOW.

00:18:30.659 --> 00:18:32.429
I WAS EXPECTING THIS.

00:18:32.429 --> 00:18:34.501
[THINKING]
NOW THAT THE SEAL
OF ORICHALCOS

00:18:34.501 --> 00:18:35.736
IS ON THE FIELD,

00:18:35.736 --> 00:18:37.574
THE EVIL THAT
CONTROLS MAI

00:18:37.574 --> 00:18:39.679
JUST GOT 10
TIMES STRONGER!

00:18:39.679 --> 00:18:42.016
BUT I KNOW THE REAL MAI
IS IN THERE SOMEWHERE,

00:18:42.016 --> 00:18:43.853
AND I'M GONNA
SET HER FREE...

00:18:43.853 --> 00:18:46.059
NO MATTER
WHAT IT TAKES!

00:18:46.059 --> 00:18:47.161
ALL RIGHT!

00:18:47.161 --> 00:18:49.866
NOW I SUMMON ANOTHER
CYBER HARPIE!

00:18:49.866 --> 00:18:54.176
THAT'S TWO, IF YOU'RE
KEEPING SCORE!

00:18:54.176 --> 00:18:56.615
AND THANKS TO MY
SHINY NEW MAGIC CARD,

AN EXTRA 500 ATTACK
POINTS NOW!

00:19:02.159 --> 00:19:03.730
HARPIE, ATTACK!

00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:07.371
TEAR HIS GATOR TO SHREDS
WITH SHADOW NAIL SLICE!

00:19:15.822 --> 00:19:16.958
AND NOW...

00:19:16.958 --> 00:19:19.330
IT'S MONSTER NUMBER
TWO'S TURN!

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:21.567
HOLD YOUR HARPIES!

00:19:21.567 --> 00:19:23.204
GO, SCAPEGOAT!

00:19:23.204 --> 00:19:26.145
YOU'LL HAVE TO
GO THROUGH THEM
TO GET TO ME!

00:19:26.145 --> 00:19:27.814
YOU USE THAT
CARD EVERY DUEL,

00:19:27.814 --> 00:19:30.554
SO FORGIVE ME FOR
NOT BEING SHOCKED.

00:19:30.554 --> 00:19:31.556

NIGHTMARE TRI-MIRROR!

00:19:38.471 --> 00:19:41.310
IT CASTS A REFLECTION
OF YOUR 4 SCAPEGOATS.

00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:43.649
AFTER THAT IT TRANSFORMS
THAT REFLECTION

00:19:43.649 --> 00:19:46.388
INTO 4 NEW MONSTERS ON
MY SIDE OF THE FIELD!

00:19:46.388 --> 00:19:47.990
THAT MEANS, THANKS TO YOU,

00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:52.266
I NOW HAVE 4 MORE CYBER
HARPIES TO ADD TO MY FLOCK!

00:20:05.328 --> 00:20:09.437
CRUSH HIS
SCAPEGOAT TOKEN!

00:20:13.345 --> 00:20:15.183
LUCKY FOR YOU MY
4 NEW HARPIES

00:20:15.183 --> 00:20:17.087
CAN'T ATTACK
UNTIL NEXT TURN.

00:20:17.087 --> 00:20:19.859
SO, I'LL TAKE
A BREAK...FOR NOW.

00:20:19.859 --> 00:20:22.198
BUT YOU BETTER THINK OF
SOME NEW TRICKS, WHEELER.

00:20:22.198 --> 00:20:24.803
BECAUSE I'VE SEEN ALL
OF YOUR MOVES BEFORE.

00:20:24.803 --> 00:20:26.139
YOU HEAR ME?

00:20:26.139 --> 00:20:27.141
LOUD AND CLEAR.

00:20:27.141 --> 00:20:28.376
AND DON'T WORRY,

00:20:28.376 --> 00:20:30.545
I GOT A FEW NEW
TWISTS PLANNED.

00:20:30.545 --> 00:20:31.712
YOU SHOULD KNOW BY NOW,

00:20:31.712 --> 00:20:33.548
YOUR BLUFFS DON'T
WORK ON ME!

00:20:33.548 --> 00:20:35.049
YOU'RE GOING DOWN!

00:20:35.049 --> 00:20:37.585
AND I'M GOING
STRAIGHT TO THE TOP!

00:20:37.585 --> 00:20:40.221
THERE'S NOWHERE
TO RUN, WHEELER!

00:20:40.221 --> 00:20:41.255
[THINKING]
DON'T WORRY.

00:20:41.255 --> 00:20:43.624
I DON'T PLAN ON
RUNNING AWAY.

00:20:43.624 --> 00:20:44.792
I'M GONNA
KEEP FIGHTING

00:20:44.792 --> 00:20:46.527
UNTIL I BREAK
THROUGH TO YOU, MAI.

00:20:46.527 --> 00:20:48.596
OR LOSE MY SOUL TRYING!
