00:08:43.723 --> 00:08:45.358
FOR DESE TWO
WEIRDOES.

00:08:45.358 --> 00:08:47.827
LET'S GO.
GOOD CALL.

00:08:47.827 --> 00:08:49.529
Man: CAN YOU EXPLAIN
THE SUDDEN APPEARANCE...

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:50.997
Woman: THE MAYOR
IS POINTING HIS FINGER
AT KAIBA CORP.

00:08:50.997 --> 00:08:52.331
WHAT DO YOU HAVE
TO SAY ABOUT THAT?

00:08:52.331 --> 00:08:53.566
Second man:
PEOPLE WANT ANSWERS!

00:08:53.566 --> 00:08:55.701
Roland: PLEASE,
ONE AT A TIME.

00:08:55.701 --> 00:08:57.870
IS KAIBA CORP
RESPONSIBLE
FOR ALL THIS?

00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:00.206
THE PEOPLE OF THIS TOWN
DESERVE TO KNOW.

00:09:00.206 --> 00:09:03.976
MR. KAIBA HAS ASSURED ME
THAT HIS COMPANY
IS NOT TO BLAME.

00:09:03.976 --> 00:09:06.679
WE HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENTS
AT THIS TIME.

00:09:06.679 --> 00:09:08.681
MOVE IT.

00:09:08.681 --> 00:09:12.318
MR. KAIBA WILL BE HOLDING
A PRESS CONFERENCE LATER TODAY.

00:09:12.318 --> 00:09:13.653
BUT WE WANT ANSWERS NOW!

00:09:13.653 --> 00:09:15.154
Man: THE CITY IS
IN A STATE OF EMERGENCY!

00:09:15.154 --> 00:09:16.255
Second man:
THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE!

00:09:16.255 --> 00:09:17.256
Third man: I NEED
MORE INFORMATION.

00:09:17.256 --> 00:09:18.257
THIS IS AN OUTRAGE.

00:09:18.257 --> 00:09:20.793
WHOA, IT'S A TOTAL
CIRCUS OVER HERE.

00:09:20.793 --> 00:09:23.029
GUESS WE'RE
NOT GONNA SEE KAIBA.

00:09:25.298 --> 00:09:26.532
Man, on TV:
IN THE LAST 24 HOURS,

00:09:26.532 --> 00:09:28.935
MONSTERS HAVE BEEN SPOTTED
ACROSS THE GLOBE,

00:09:28.935 --> 00:09:32.438
INCLUDING A WINGED DRAGON
THAT WAS SEEN PERCHED
ATOP TAJ MAHAL.

00:09:32.438 --> 00:09:35.641
THESE CREATURES
ARE BELIEVED TO BE
LIFELIKE HOLOGRAMS

00:09:35.641 --> 00:09:38.911
ASSOCIATED
WITH THE POPULAR GAME
DUEL MONSTERS.

00:09:38.911 --> 00:09:41.614
SO DIS MONSTA MESS
IS HAPPENIN'
AROUND THE WORLD.

00:09:41.614 --> 00:09:43.983
AND THERE'S
STILL NO WORD YET
FROM KAIBA.

00:09:43.983 --> 00:09:46.886
WE NOW TAKE YOU LIVE
TO A KAIBA CORP
PRESS CONFERENCE

00:09:46.886 --> 00:09:50.923
WHERE GAMING COMPANY
PRESIDENT SETO KAIBA
WILL MAKE A STATEMENT.

00:09:50.923 --> 00:09:52.125
ABOUT TIME.

00:09:52.125 --> 00:09:53.893
WE'VE DONE EXTENSIVE TESTING

00:09:53.893 --> 00:09:56.395
OF OUR HOLOGRAPHIC
SIMULATION SYSTEMS.

00:09:56.395 --> 00:09:58.397
NOW, I CAN CONFIRM
WITHOUT QUESTION

00:09:58.397 --> 00:10:01.033
THAT THESE SIGHTINGS
ARE UNRELATED TO KAIBA CORP.

00:10:01.033 --> 00:10:02.068
OUR STATE-OF-THE-ART TECHNOLOGY
IS WORKING PERFECTLY.

00:10:02.068 --> 00:10:05.371
News anchor, on TV:
YOU HEARD IT HERE.

00:10:05.371 --> 00:10:06.973
SETO KAIBA CLAIMS
HIS COMPANY

00:10:06.973 --> 00:10:08.274
IS NOT RESPONSIBLE
FOR TODAY'S EVENTS.

00:10:08.274 --> 00:10:10.710
HE'S COVERING UP.

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:12.478
WHO ELSE
HAS THE EQUIPMENT

00:10:12.478 --> 00:10:13.846
TO PROJECT MONSTERS
AROUND THE WORLD?

00:10:13.846 --> 00:10:15.815
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
THOSE MONSTERS OUT THERE

00:10:15.815 --> 00:10:17.850
AREN'T HOLOGRAPHIC
PROJECTIONS AT ALL.

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:19.919
ACTUALLY,
I WAS JUST THINKING

00:10:19.919 --> 00:10:22.155
THE EXACT SAME THING,
TEA.

00:10:22.155 --> 00:10:23.923
PERHAPS THE FORCE I FELT
IN THE MUSEUM

00:10:23.923 --> 00:10:26.626
SOMEHOW TRIGGERED
THE EMERGENCE
OF THESE CREATURES,

00:10:26.626 --> 00:10:29.729
WHICH COULD MEAN
THAT THESE DUEL MONSTERS
ARE REAL.

00:10:29.729 --> 00:10:32.198
I WONDER IF THAT'S
WHAT REX AND WEEVIL
WERE REFERRING TO

00:10:32.198 --> 00:10:35.434
WHEN WE SAW THEM TODAY.

00:10:35.434 --> 00:10:36.836
HEH HEH HEH.

00:10:36.836 --> 00:10:39.305
THE AGE
OF DESTRUCTION
IS HERE.

00:10:39.305 --> 00:10:41.607
SOON YOUR SOULS
WILL BE OFFERED
TO THE GREAT BEAST.

00:10:41.607 --> 00:10:46.746
WAIT, ARE YOU TELLIN' ME
WE'RE UNDER ATTACK
BY ACTUAL MONSTAS?

00:10:46.746 --> 00:10:49.048
I'M NOT SURE
WHAT TO THINK RIGHT NOW.

00:10:49.048 --> 00:10:50.116
[GRANDPA SHOUTS]

00:10:50.116 --> 00:10:51.117
Grandpa: NOOO!

00:10:51.117 --> 00:10:54.120
HOW CAN THIS HAVE HAPPENED?

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.022
Yugi: GRANDPA!
GRANDPA!

00:10:56.022 --> 00:10:57.890
NO!

00:10:57.890 --> 00:10:59.458
HEY, WHAT HAPPENED,

00:10:59.458 --> 00:11:01.561
YUGI, THEY'RE GONE.

00:11:01.561 --> 00:11:03.462
WHO'S GONE, GRANDPA?

00:11:03.462 --> 00:11:04.730

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:06.399
YOUR STRONGEST CARDS.

00:11:06.399 --> 00:11:07.967
THE GOD CARDS?

00:11:07.967 --> 00:11:09.035
WHO DID DIS?

00:11:09.035 --> 00:11:11.437

Joey: GUYS,
YA MIGHT WANNA SEE DIS.

00:11:26.252 --> 00:11:29.155
IT'S OBELISK

00:11:32.124 --> 00:11:34.293
AND IT LOOKS LIKE
HE'S NOT ALONE.

00:11:34.293 --> 00:11:35.795
IT'S SLIFER AND RA.

00:11:35.795 --> 00:11:37.230
Joey:
WHAT KINDA KNUCKLEHEAD

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:39.098

WE'VE BEEN KNOWN
TO FIGHT DIRTY.

IT GONNA BE, MATES?

00:11:57.016 --> 00:11:58.251
YOU DON'T SCARE US.

00:11:58.251 --> 00:12:01.254
THOSE EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS
DON'T BELONG TO YOU!

00:12:01.254 --> 00:12:03.389
SORRY TO DISAPPOINT YOU,

00:12:03.389 --> 00:12:07.193
BUT THEY SERVE
A NEW MASTER NOW, PHARAOH.

00:12:07.193 --> 00:12:08.461
Yugi, voice-over: NO WAY.

00:12:08.461 --> 00:12:10.129
HOW DOES HE KNOW
ABOUT THE PHARAOH?

00:12:10.129 --> 00:12:12.164
IF YOU THINK YOU'VE GOT
WHAT IT TAKES

00:12:12.164 --> 00:12:15.167

00:12:45.231 --> 00:12:48.200
VERY WELL.

I POSSESS SOMETHING
THAT YOU WANT--

00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:55.041
THE 3 EGYPTIAN
GOD CARDS.

00:12:55.041 --> 00:12:58.377
AND YOU POSSESS
SOMETHING THAT I DESIRE--

00:13:00.112 --> 00:13:01.514
JUST HOLD ON.

00:13:01.514 --> 00:13:03.883
THOSE CARDS DO NOT
BELONG TO YOU,

00:13:03.883 --> 00:13:06.619
AND THEY POSSESS
A POWER FAR MORE
DANGEROUS

00:13:06.619 --> 00:13:08.321
THAN YOU COULD EVER
UNDERSTAND.

00:13:08.321 --> 00:13:10.289
I'D SUGGEST
YOU HAND THEM OVER

00:13:10.289 --> 00:13:12.525
BEFORE SOMEONE
GETS HURT.

00:13:12.525 --> 00:13:14.593
I'M WELL AWARE
OF THEIR ANCIENT POWERS,

00:13:14.593 --> 00:13:15.728
AND IF YOU WANT
THEM BACK,

00:13:15.728 --> 00:13:17.496
YOU'LL HAVE TO FACE ME
IN A DUEL.

00:13:17.496 --> 00:13:22.902

BE THRILLED.

AS SOON AS THE PHARAOH'S
LIFE POINTS HIT ZERO,
WE GET HIS SOUL.

00:14:03.843 --> 00:14:06.679

DOESN'T USE

NEVER LOSES.

AND THIS YOUNG MAN
COMES WITH A VERY
SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:14:24.163 --> 00:14:28.267
HE LETS ME AUTOMATICALLY
SUMMON ANOTHER MONSTER
TO THE FIELD TO JOIN HIM,

00:14:28.267 --> 00:14:33.339

00:14:36.876 --> 00:14:38.477
READY?

00:14:38.477 --> 00:14:41.814
THIS CARD HOLDS MORE POWER
THAN ALL 3 EGYPTIAN GODS,

00:14:41.814 --> 00:14:44.183

AS TIME ITSELF--

THE SEAL OF ORICHALCOS!

00:14:48.454 --> 00:14:51.323
THE MAGIC INFUSED
WITHIN THIS CARD

00:14:51.323 --> 00:14:56.195
EXISTED LONG BEFORE
THE SANDS OF ANCIENT EGYPT
WERE FORMED, PHARAOH.

00:14:56.195 --> 00:14:59.398
NOW EXPERIENCE THIS POWER
FOR YOURSELF.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.679

MY FRIENDS!
UNH!

00:15:23.255 --> 00:15:27.793
THE SEAL OF ORICHALCOS
PREVENTS US FROM EXITING

00:15:27.793 --> 00:15:32.097
AND ALL OUTSIDERS
FROM ENTERING
ITS SACRED BOUNDARIES.

00:15:32.097 --> 00:15:38.304
WHEN THE DUEL IS OVER,
ONLY THE VICTOR
MAY PENETRATE THE BORDER,

00:15:38.304 --> 00:15:41.140
BUT THE LOSER
CAN NEVER LEAVE.

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:44.210
HIS SOUL REMAINS
LOCKED INSIDE THE SEAL.

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:47.580
YOU'LL SOON SEE
THAT THE RULES
OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:49.648
NO LONGER APPLY.

00:15:49.648 --> 00:15:50.883
ALL RIGHT.

00:15:50.883 --> 00:15:53.986

I'M NO STRANGER
TO ANCIENT MAGIC.

THE POWER OF
MY MILLENNIUM PUZZLE!

WHAT'S THIS?

00:16:00.659 --> 00:16:04.396
THE ORICHALCOS EXISTED
LONG BEFORE YOUR PUZZLE.

00:16:04.396 --> 00:16:06.198
YOUR TOY IS USELESS

00:16:06.198 --> 00:16:08.367
AND YOUR VICTORY
IS HOPELESS.

00:16:08.367 --> 00:16:11.837
SORRY, BUT IN HERE

NOW, MY MARAUDING CAPTAIN,
ATTACK.

00:16:40.332 --> 00:16:42.501
DESTROY
HIS MAGNET WARRIOR.

00:16:45.271 --> 00:16:47.640
YOU'VE TRIGGERED
MY TRAP.

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:49.708
GO, SOUL ROPE!

00:16:49.708 --> 00:16:53.312
IT ALLOWS ME TO SUMMON
A 4-STAR MONSTER
FROM MY DECK,

00:16:53.312 --> 00:16:57.383
AS LONG AS I'M WILLING
TO GIVE UP 1,000
OF MY LIFE POINTS

00:16:57.383 --> 00:17:00.886
IN EXCHANGE
FOR THIS NEW CREATURE.

00:17:00.886 --> 00:17:04.056
THERE'S NOTHING
IN YOUR DECK
THAT CAN STOP ME.

00:17:04.056 --> 00:17:05.057
WRONG.

00:17:05.057 --> 00:17:08.494
I HAVE GAMMA
THE MAGNET WARRIOR.

00:17:08.494 --> 00:17:13.032
SORRY, BUT YOU'LL HAVE
TO DO BETTER THAN THAT
IF YOU WANT TO DEFEAT ME.

00:17:13.032 --> 00:17:15.401
I'LL PLACE ONE CARD
FACE DOWN.

00:17:15.401 --> 00:17:18.070
WHY DON'T YOU TRY AGAIN,
PHARAOH?

00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:21.006
I PLAN TO DO MORE
THAN TRY.

00:17:21.006 --> 00:17:23.108
FEAST YOU EYES
ON THIS CARD:

00:17:23.108 --> 00:17:26.445
ALPHA
THE MAGNET WARRIOR!

00:17:26.445 --> 00:17:28.280
WHY, THANK YOU.

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:30.883
YOU'VE ACTIVATED
MY HIDDEN SOLDIERS TRAP.

00:17:30.883 --> 00:17:32.418
UNFORTUNATELY FOR YOU,

00:17:32.418 --> 00:17:36.555
THIS CARD ALLOWS ME
TO CONJURE UP A CREATURE
OF ULTIMATE DARKNESS,

00:17:36.555 --> 00:17:41.193
A MONSTER THAT DERIVES
ITS VERY POWER
FROM THE DEEPEST SHADOWS:

00:17:41.193 --> 00:17:43.395
MAKYURA THE DESTRUCTOR.

00:17:43.395 --> 00:17:45.497
AND LIKE ALL MY MONSTERS,

00:17:45.497 --> 00:17:49.868
ITS STRENGTH IS ENHANCED
BY THE ORICHALCOS.

00:17:49.868 --> 00:17:53.539
WELL,
I ALSO HAVE A MAGIC CARD
TO ACTIVATE.

00:17:53.539 --> 00:17:55.908
BEHOLD MY SHALLOW GRAVE!

00:17:55.908 --> 00:17:58.243
IT GIVES US BOTH
THE POWER TO ACCESS

00:17:58.243 --> 00:18:00.713
ANY MONSTER WE CHOOSE
FROM OUR GRAVEYARD

00:18:00.713 --> 00:18:02.781
AND SUMMON IT BACK
TO THE FIELD,

00:18:02.781 --> 00:18:08.153
AND I'VE CHOSEN
BETA THE MAGNET WARRIOR!

00:18:08.153 --> 00:18:10.155
AND YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

00:18:10.155 --> 00:18:13.525
NOW I CAN COMBINE
MY MAGNET WARRIORS
TOGETHER.

00:18:13.525 --> 00:18:16.595
ALPHA, BETA,
AND GAMMA...

00:18:23.068 --> 00:18:26.138
FUSE YOUR
ELECTROMAGNETIC ENERGIES
TOGETHER

00:18:26.138 --> 00:18:32.511
TO FORM VALKYRION
THE MAGNA WARRIOR!

00:18:32.511 --> 00:18:34.580
SINCE YOUR GRAVEYARD
IS EMPTY,

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:37.883
YOU HAVE NO MONSTERS
TO BRING BACK.

00:18:37.883 --> 00:18:39.718
HE BETTER THINK
'A SOMETHIN' QUICK

00:18:39.718 --> 00:18:41.920
OR THE PHARAOH'S
GONNA KICK HIS BUM.

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:43.389
RELAX, VALON.

00:18:43.389 --> 00:18:46.759
THERE'S PLENTY
OF TIME LEFT.

00:18:46.759 --> 00:18:49.395
NOW, VALKYRION,
ATTACK!

00:18:52.364 --> 00:18:55.267
YOUR CAPTAIN IS GONE.

00:18:55.267 --> 00:18:56.602
NICE ONE, MAN!

00:18:56.602 --> 00:18:57.703
A'RIGHT, YUGE!

00:18:57.703 --> 00:18:59.905
THAT CAPED CREEP'S
GOT NOTHIN' ON YOU!

00:18:59.905 --> 00:19:01.874
WELL PLAYED.

00:19:01.874 --> 00:19:03.242
I MUST ADMIT,

00:19:03.242 --> 00:19:06.011
I HAVEN'T FACED
A CHALLENGE LIKE THIS
IN QUITE SOME TIME.

00:19:06.011 --> 00:19:09.181
IT'S ACTUALLY REFRESHING.

00:19:09.181 --> 00:19:13.085
OF COURSE, IN THE END
YOU'LL MEET THE SAME FATE
AS ALL OF MY VICTIMS.

00:19:13.085 --> 00:19:16.121
I'M AFRAID IT'S JUST
A MATTER OF TIME.

00:19:16.121 --> 00:19:18.490
DIS GUY'S BLUFFIN',
YUGE.

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:21.860
YOUR MAGNA WARRIOR'S
GOT 3,500
ATTACK POINTS,

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:23.228
SO THE ONLY DING DAT
COULD BEAT IT

00:19:23.228 --> 00:19:25.564
IS AN EGYPTIAN
GOD CARD.

00:19:25.564 --> 00:19:27.332
OH, NO. YOU CAN'T!

00:19:27.332 --> 00:19:30.502
I CAN AND I WILL,
PHARAOH.

00:19:30.502 --> 00:19:33.739
I'LL DESTROY YOU
WITH YOUR OWN EGYPTIAN GOD!

00:19:33.739 --> 00:19:37.776
FIRST, I'LL BRING
MY MARAUDING CAPTAIN
BACK FROM THE GRAVEYARD

00:19:37.776 --> 00:19:40.612
USING THE MAGIC
OF MONSTER REBORN.

00:19:43.515 --> 00:19:44.516
HOLD ON.

00:19:44.516 --> 00:19:46.885
ONLY CERTAIN DUELISTS
CAN USE THE GODS.

00:19:46.885 --> 00:19:47.953
PLEASE, STOP.

00:19:47.953 --> 00:19:50.122
IT'S TOO LATE
TO STOP ME NOW.

00:19:50.122 --> 00:19:52.791
I SACRIFICE
MY 3 MONSTERS...

00:19:52.791 --> 00:19:53.892
NO! DON'T!

00:19:53.892 --> 00:19:56.762
IN ORDER TO SUMMON
THE EGYPTIAN GOD

00:19:56.762 --> 00:20:00.232
OBELISK THE TORMENTOR.

00:20:00.232 --> 00:20:03.135
[LAUGHING INSANELY]

00:20:06.271 --> 00:20:09.074
[ROARING]

00:20:09.074 --> 00:20:10.409
I WARNED HIM.

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:17.316
OH, NO. THIS CAN'T BE.

00:20:17.316 --> 00:20:19.451
HE'S GOT THAT THING
ON HIS HEAD!

00:20:19.451 --> 00:20:22.254
IT'S WORSE THAN DAT.
HE'S STRONGER NOW.

00:20:22.254 --> 00:20:26.158
[LAUGHING]

00:20:26.158 --> 00:20:30.028
THE POWER OF THE ORICHALCOS
NOW COURSES THROUGH OBELISK,

00:20:30.028 --> 00:20:32.965
MERGING THE MOST POWERFUL
CREATURE THAT EVER EXISTED

00:20:32.965 --> 00:20:36.168
WITH THE MOST INCREDIBLE
FORCE EVER IMAGINED.

00:20:36.168 --> 00:20:39.738
YOU'RE TRAPPED
IN MY CIRCLE OF DOOM,
PHARAOH,

00:20:39.738 --> 00:20:45.177
AND BEFORE LONG
YOUR SOUL WILL BE SEALED
AWAY FOR ALL ETERNITY.
