IF YOU ARE, THEN ALLOW ME
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH.

00:08:42.389 --> 00:08:44.657
THAT ORICHALCOS CARD
DID MORE FOR MAI

THAN YOU EVER COULD!

00:08:45.992 --> 00:08:48.395
SHE WAS WEAK, AND IT
MADE HER STRONG!

00:08:48.395 --> 00:08:52.098
SHE WAS LOST, AND IT
SHOWED HER THE WAY!

YOU TAKING ME HERE...

I OWE YOU ANYTHING.

00:09:31.538 --> 00:09:33.706
IN BEING PART OF
SOME TEAM, VALON.

00:09:33.706 --> 00:09:36.009
I ALREADY MADE
THAT MISTAKE ONCE

00:09:36.009 --> 00:09:37.377
AND YOU KNOW WHERE
IT GOT ME?

00:09:37.377 --> 00:09:39.512

WE'RE BOTH LONERS.

TO ADMIT...

00:09:50.423 --> 00:09:53.226
SOMETIMES IT'S NOT
ALL THAT FUN.

00:09:59.232 --> 00:10:01.067
WHY THE LONG
FACE, MAI?

00:10:01.067 --> 00:10:02.502

YOU DOWN FOR HER.

ONCE YOU'RE OUT
OF THE PICTURE,

00:10:24.257 --> 00:10:25.625
SHE CAN MOVE ON

BETTER THINGS!

ROUGH AROUND THE EDGES,

AN ATTITUDE

I SUMMON ROCKET WARRIOR
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:14.640
ROCKET WARRIOR,
ATTACK HIS OVER BOOST!

00:16:17.109 --> 00:16:19.445

ATTACK DEFLECTION.

Joey: OH, WELL!

00:16:25.751 --> 00:16:27.386
THERE GOES
YOUR SHIELD!

00:16:27.386 --> 00:16:29.355
BUT MY ROCKET
WARRIOR COMES AWAY

00:16:29.355 --> 00:16:31.157
WITHOUT A SCRATCH
'CAUSE I WAS
SMART ENOUGH

00:16:31.157 --> 00:16:32.625
TO PUT HIM IN
INVINCIBLE MODE!

00:16:32.625 --> 00:16:35.728
AND EVEN THOUGH
YOU LOWERED JINZO'S
ATTACK POINTS,

00:16:35.728 --> 00:16:37.396
HE'S STILL
STRONG ENOUGH

00:16:37.396 --> 00:16:38.564
TO DESTROY YOUR
JET GAUNTLET!

00:16:38.564 --> 00:16:40.566
HERE WE GO AGAIN!

00:16:46.772 --> 00:16:47.940
MY JINZO!

DON'T TELL ME...

00:16:53.312 --> 00:16:56.449
THAT WAS YOUR SPECIAL
ABILITY, RIGHT?

00:16:56.449 --> 00:16:59.685
I'M GETTING A LITTLE
TIRED OF THIS, ROBO-BOY!

00:16:59.685 --> 00:17:00.786
[GRUNTS]

00:17:00.786 --> 00:17:02.054
NICE SHOT.

00:17:02.054 --> 00:17:03.890
I WASN'T EXPECTING
THAT ONE.

00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:05.424
I'VE GOT TO ADMIT,

00:17:05.424 --> 00:17:07.693
YOU'RE NOT SUCH A TERRIBLE
DUELIST, WHEELER.

00:17:07.693 --> 00:17:09.328
THANKS, I THINK.

00:17:09.328 --> 00:17:11.097
HA! BUT I'M BETTER.

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:17.103
I KNOW THEY'RE AROUND
HERE SOMEWHERE.

00:17:17.103 --> 00:17:19.572
AND I HAVE TO
STOP THAT DUEL NOW.

00:17:19.572 --> 00:17:21.474
I'D BETTER NOT
BE TOO LATE.

00:17:21.474 --> 00:17:23.543
'CAUSE I'M GONNA
MAKE WHEELER PAY

00:17:23.543 --> 00:17:25.211
FOR WHAT HE DID TO ME.

[LAUGHING]

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:32.685
I CAN'T...

00:17:32.685 --> 00:17:34.954
I'LL NEVER GO BACK
TO THAT PLACE!

00:17:34.954 --> 00:17:37.456
I HAVE TO DESTROY
JOEY WHEELER!

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:43.195
AS SOON AS HE'S
LOCKED AWAY,

00:17:43.195 --> 00:17:46.165
I CAN PUT MY PAST BEHIND
ME ONCE AND FOR ALL!

00:17:46.165 --> 00:17:48.467
THAT PATHETIC FOOL ISN'T
GONNA KNOW WHAT HIT HIM

00:17:48.467 --> 00:17:49.769
TILL IT'S TOO LATE!

00:17:54.206 --> 00:17:56.175
Rebecca: LET'S TRY THIS AGAIN.

00:17:58.744 --> 00:18:00.780
COME ON...

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:02.348
UGH!

00:18:02.348 --> 00:18:03.416
HEY!

00:18:03.416 --> 00:18:05.017
ANY LUCK IN THERE,
REBECCA?

00:18:05.017 --> 00:18:06.986
YOU'VE ASKED
5 TIMES.

00:18:06.986 --> 00:18:08.688
SHE'S WORKING AS
FAST AS SHE CAN.

00:18:08.688 --> 00:18:11.357
AREN'T YOU THE ONE WHO
TOLD US TO HAVE FAITH?

00:18:11.357 --> 00:18:13.726
WHY DON'T YOU GET
OFF MY BACK, DUKE!

00:18:13.726 --> 00:18:15.061
JOEY'S IN TROUBLE,

00:18:15.061 --> 00:18:16.395
AND IF WE
DON'T MOVE FAST

00:18:16.395 --> 00:18:17.863
THINGS COULD
GET EVEN WORSE!

00:18:17.863 --> 00:18:19.532
TAKE IT EASY,
TRISTAN.

00:18:19.532 --> 00:18:20.600
I CAN'T!

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:21.701
DON'T YOU GUYS SEE THAT

00:18:21.701 --> 00:18:23.603
THIS WHOLE THING
IS MY FAULT!

00:18:23.603 --> 00:18:25.104
NO, TRISTAN.

00:18:25.104 --> 00:18:27.440
WHEN JOEY AND I GOT
SEPARATED FROM YOU GUYS,

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:28.941
HE TOLD ME ABOUT HIS PLAN,

00:18:28.941 --> 00:18:30.943
AND I SHOULD HAVE TALKED
HIM OUT OF IT THEN.

00:18:34.747 --> 00:18:36.449
I JUST FIGURED
IT ALL OUT.

00:18:36.449 --> 00:18:37.516
FIGURED WHAT OUT?

00:18:37.516 --> 00:18:40.586
WHY MAI TEAMED UP
WITH THOSE LOW-LIVES.

00:18:40.586 --> 00:18:42.355
IT'S 'CAUSE I WAS
A TERRIBLE FRIEND.

00:18:42.355 --> 00:18:44.223
I LET HER DOWN.

00:18:44.223 --> 00:18:45.324
THAT'S CRAZY.

00:18:45.324 --> 00:18:47.093
BUT IT'S TRUE.

00:18:47.093 --> 00:18:49.395
DARTZ MAY BE THE ONE
THAT BRAINWASHED HER...

00:18:49.395 --> 00:18:51.130
BUT I'M THE ONE
THAT DROVE HER AWAY

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:52.531
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

00:18:52.531 --> 00:18:54.734
NOW I GOTTA GO
AND SET THINGS STRAIGHT

00:18:54.734 --> 00:18:57.303
BY FINDING THESE GUYS
AND BREAKING THAT SPELL!

00:18:57.303 --> 00:18:59.138
BUT HOW?

00:18:59.138 --> 00:19:01.707
AW, MAN.

00:19:01.707 --> 00:19:03.676
WHAT WAS I
THINKING?!

00:19:03.676 --> 00:19:05.478
HOW COULD I LET
HIM DO THIS?

00:19:05.478 --> 00:19:08.414
JOEY'S GOT A MIND
OF HIS OWN, TRISTAN.

00:19:08.414 --> 00:19:11.784
[THINKING]
LET'S JUST HOPE
HE'S USING IT.

00:19:15.788 --> 00:19:18.758
TIME TO CRUSH
YOUR LAST MONSTER!

00:19:18.758 --> 00:19:22.094
I SUMMON BUSTER PYLE!

00:19:22.094 --> 00:19:24.263
WHAT'S THAT,
A REPLACEMENT ARM?

00:19:24.263 --> 00:19:27.900
EXACTLY!

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:30.436

[SCREAMING]

00:19:40.413 --> 00:19:43.716
SINCE YOUR BUSTER PYLE
ONLY HAS 500 POINTS,

00:19:43.716 --> 00:19:45.918
I'LL ASSUME IT'S GOT
A SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:19:45.918 --> 00:19:48.754
YOU'RE VERY
OBSERVANT, WHEELER!

00:19:48.754 --> 00:19:51.223
MY BUSTER PYLE
AUTOMATICALLY WIPES OUT

00:19:51.223 --> 00:19:54.427
ANY MONSTER IT ATTACKS,
REGARDLESS OF POINTS.

00:19:54.427 --> 00:19:57.763
PLUS ITS TAKES AWAY 500
OF YOUR LIFE POINTS.

00:19:58.798 --> 00:20:00.199
AND NOW,

00:20:00.199 --> 00:20:02.435
I'LL END MY TURN
WITH THIS CARD.

00:20:02.435 --> 00:20:06.405
IT'S CALLED DATA BRAIN!

00:20:06.405 --> 00:20:09.775
AND I'LL LINK IT UP WITH
MY PSYCHIC ARMOR HEAD!

00:20:11.043 --> 00:20:13.345

WHAT THIS CAN DO!

THIS GUY'S ABLE TO
BLOW IT SKY HIGH!
