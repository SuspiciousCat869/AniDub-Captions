THIS HAS TO WORK.

ACCESS GRANTED.

00:02:07.294 --> 00:02:09.131
I GOT IN, GRANDPA.

00:02:09.131 --> 00:02:10.132
WELL DONE.

I DIDN'T THINK OF IT
LIKE THAT.

00:02:32.807 --> 00:02:34.143

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:37.783

I KNOW JOEY CAN TAKE
CARE OF HIMSELF.

HE'S BEEN IN TOUGH
SITUATIONS BEFORE.

00:02:43.661 --> 00:02:45.665
NOT THIS TOUGH.

00:02:45.665 --> 00:02:46.833

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:49.204

WE NEED YOUR TALENTS
BACK HERE.

00:03:26.138 --> 00:03:30.012
REBECCA,
AS SOON AS JOEY'S SAFE,
WE'LL FIND YUGI.

00:03:30.012 --> 00:03:32.917
PROMISE ME HE'S ALL RIGHT.

00:03:32.917 --> 00:03:34.687
YUGI'S GOING TO

00:03:35.856 --> 00:03:38.594
PLEASE, TRUST ME.

00:03:38.594 --> 00:03:40.765
COME ON YOU DON'T HAVE
A SECOND TO LOSE,

00:03:40.765 --> 00:03:42.935
SO GO KICK SOME BUTT
AND TAKE NAMES.

00:03:42.935 --> 00:03:44.872
WELL, THAT'S ONE WAY
TO PUT IT.

00:03:44.872 --> 00:03:47.778
LET'S CHIT-CHAT LATER.

00:03:47.778 --> 00:03:49.380
GOOD LUCK
WITH EVERYTHING.

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.683

00:03:50.683 --> 00:03:52.219
Grandpa:
IF YOU NEED US,
JUST CALL.

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:55.091
RIGHT.

00:03:55.091 --> 00:03:56.994
DON'T WORRY,
REBECCA.

00:03:56.994 --> 00:04:00.434
YUGI WILL BE BACK HERE
SAFE AND SOUND
IN NO TIME AT ALL.

00:04:00.434 --> 00:04:02.271
BUT HOW DO YA KNOW?

00:04:02.271 --> 00:04:04.542
BECAUSE I BELIEVE
IN THE PHARAOH,

00:04:04.542 --> 00:04:06.211
AND YOU SHOULD, TOO.

00:04:06.211 --> 00:04:08.115
FINE.

00:04:08.115 --> 00:04:09.784

REBECCA'S HAVING A HARD TIME

FORGIVING THE PHARAOH
FOR WHAT HAPPENED TO YUGI.

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.395
SHE MUST THINK
HE'LL BE TEMPTED BY
EVIL AGAIN.

00:04:15.395 --> 00:04:17.398
LET'S JUST HOPE SHE'S WRONG.

STARE AT THAT CARD
ALL NIGHT, ARE YA?

WHEN YOU ACTUALLY PLAY IT.

00:04:29.787 --> 00:04:32.392
YOU'RE EVEN DUMBER
THAN YOU LOOK,

00:04:32.392 --> 00:04:34.129
BUT YOU ASKED FOR IT.

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:37.268
FIRST I SUMMON
MY BRIGADIER OF LANDSTAR.

00:04:40.975 --> 00:04:45.149
AND THEN I ACTIVATE
MY MONSTER REBORN CARD,

00:04:45.149 --> 00:04:48.188
AND I'M USIN' IT TO BRING
MY ROCKET WARRIOR BACK.

00:04:51.995 --> 00:04:57.972
AND FINALLY, I PLAY THIS,
THE CLAW OF HERMOS.

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:04.751
'BOUT TIME.

00:05:04.751 --> 00:05:06.388
I WAS WAITIN' FOR THAT.

00:05:06.388 --> 00:05:09.259
THIS WAY,
I CAN REALLY PROVE
MY STRENGTH.

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:11.664
SO GO, USE YOUR DRAGON.

00:05:11.664 --> 00:05:16.506
NO MONSTER'S TOO STRONG
FOR MY ARMOR.

00:05:16.506 --> 00:05:18.342
Yami-Yugi:
HOW FAR IS JOEY?

00:05:18.342 --> 00:05:21.348
JUST A FEW BLOCKS,
ACCORDING TO THIS.

00:05:21.348 --> 00:05:23.352
I JUST HOPE I'M READING
THIS THING RIGHT.

00:05:23.352 --> 00:05:26.624

DON'T SAY THAT!

00:05:26.624 --> 00:05:28.194
HOLD ON, GUYS.

00:05:32.702 --> 00:05:37.244
Tristan: JOEY MUST HAVE
PLAYED HIS DRAGON.

00:05:37.244 --> 00:05:41.317
NOW I'LL MERGE
MY CLAW OF HERMOS
WITH MY ROCKET WARRIOR!

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:54.475

00:05:56.946 --> 00:06:01.554
IT'S THE PERFECT ITEM
TO HELP MY BRIGADIER OF
LANDSTAR TAKE YOU DOWN.

COULDN'T EVEN PUT A DENT

HERMOS CANNON!

00:06:27.001 --> 00:06:28.070

OPPONENT ATTACK
UNAVOIDABLE.

PROBABILITY OF
ARMOR DESTRUCTION: 100%.

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:44.800
GUESS IT WORKED.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.905

BLOWN THE ARMOR

00:06:53.816 --> 00:06:55.687
LOOKS LIKE
I'M DA LAST MAN
STANDIN',

00:06:55.687 --> 00:06:57.857
RIGHT, PAL?

00:06:57.857 --> 00:06:59.527
Valon: WRONG.

00:06:59.527 --> 00:07:01.230
NO WAY.

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:06.707
I MAY BE DOWN,
BUT I'M NOT OUT--
THANKS TO MY ARMOR.

00:07:06.707 --> 00:07:07.709
BUT HOW?

00:07:07.709 --> 00:07:09.445
I DESTROYED YOUR ARMOR.

00:07:09.445 --> 00:07:12.116
IT'S GOT SPECIAL
ABILITIES REMEMBER?

00:07:12.116 --> 00:07:14.087
AND WHEN YOU DESTROYED IT
JUST NOW

00:07:14.087 --> 00:07:16.658
YOU LET LOSE
ITS MOST DEVASTATING ONE!

00:07:22.467 --> 00:07:26.107
DON'T YOU HATE
ALWAYS BEING ONE STEP
BEHIND ME?

00:07:26.107 --> 00:07:27.776
I KNOW YOU'RE BLUFFIN'.

00:07:27.776 --> 00:07:29.012

00:07:29.012 --> 00:07:30.114
AND YOU'RE ABOUT
TO LOSE.

00:07:30.114 --> 00:07:31.283
NOW GO!

00:07:31.283 --> 00:07:32.518
NOT QUITE.

00:07:32.518 --> 00:07:35.123
I'M STILL HOLDIN'
MY DATA BRAIN MAGIC CARD.

00:07:35.123 --> 00:07:37.194
OH, RIGHT.

00:07:37.194 --> 00:07:40.367
IT ACTIVATED
WHEN YOU DESTROYED MY ARMOR.

00:07:40.367 --> 00:07:42.971
WHAT'S IT DOIN'
TA MY ROCKET CANNON?

00:07:42.971 --> 00:07:44.474
WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE?

00:07:44.474 --> 00:07:47.212
IT'S ABSORBING INFORMATION.

00:07:47.212 --> 00:07:50.218
AS WE SPEAK,
MY DATA BRAIN IS MEMORIZING

00:07:50.218 --> 00:07:53.223
THE PRECISE
MOLECULAR STRUCTURE
OF YOUR CANNON.

00:07:53.223 --> 00:07:56.696
WHY?

00:07:56.696 --> 00:07:59.567
SO IT CAN CREATE
AN EXACT DUPLICATE
OF YOUR WEAPON

00:07:59.567 --> 00:08:01.471
ON MY SIDE OF THE FIELD.

00:08:01.471 --> 00:08:03.475
BUT I'M NOT DONE YET.

00:08:03.475 --> 00:08:05.780
SAY HELLO TO AN OLD FRIEND.

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:08.718
YOU REMEMBER MY CARD
THAT NEVA GOES AWAY,
DON'T YOU?

00:08:08.718 --> 00:08:11.222
IF NOT,
THIS'LL JOG YOUR MEMORY.

00:08:11.222 --> 00:08:13.627
PSYCHIC ARMOR HEAD,
RETURN!

00:08:18.069 --> 00:08:20.138
AND SINCE YOU'RE SO HAPPY
TO SEE IT,

00:08:20.138 --> 00:08:26.116
I'LL ALSO PLAY
ANOTHER BURNING KNUCKLE,
JUST 'CAUSE I LIKE YA.

00:08:26.116 --> 00:08:28.955
BUT THIS TIME
THINGS ARE GONNA BE
DIFFERENT,

00:08:28.955 --> 00:08:31.793
'CAUSE
I'M UPGRADING MY ARMOR
WITH A NEW WEAPON.

00:08:31.793 --> 00:08:35.667
IT'S THE ONE
I JUST GOT FROM YOU,
WHEELER.

00:08:35.667 --> 00:08:38.573
HOW COULD I EVA REPAY YOU?

00:08:38.573 --> 00:08:40.509
WAIT A SEC--
I THINK I KNOW.

00:08:40.509 --> 00:08:42.680
I'LL USE IT ON YOU.

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:44.015
NO, THANK YOU.

00:08:44.015 --> 00:08:45.384
I INSIST!

00:08:45.384 --> 00:08:47.989
ROCKET HERMOS CANNON,
ATTACK!

00:09:00.178 --> 00:09:04.853
Yami-Yugi: OH, NO.

00:09:04.853 --> 00:09:08.693
Mokuba: IT'S FADING.

00:09:08.693 --> 00:09:13.970
WHEELER.

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:17.710
LUCKY FOR YOU
THIS ROCKET CANNON
ONLY LASTS ONE TURN.

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:18.946
BUT BY THE LOOKS 'A YOU,

00:09:18.946 --> 00:09:20.949
I THINK ONE TURN
WAS ALL I NEEDED

00:09:20.949 --> 00:09:22.619
TO KNOCK YOU DOWN
FOR THE COUNT,

00:09:22.619 --> 00:09:26.960
SO I GUESS THIS MEANS
I WIN THE DUEL, EH?

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:30.868
Joey: JOEY WHEELER
NEVA GIVES UP.

00:09:30.868 --> 00:09:31.869
WHAT?

00:09:31.869 --> 00:09:32.871
LOOK AT YOURSELF, MATE.

00:09:32.871 --> 00:09:33.940
YOU'RE A MESS.

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:36.044
SO WALK AWAY
WHILE YOU STILL CAN.

00:09:36.044 --> 00:09:37.880
NO WAY.

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:39.517
I'M DOIN' DIS FOR MAI,

00:09:39.517 --> 00:09:44.960
'CAUSE WHETHER
SHE KNOWS IT OR NOT,
SHE NEEDS MY HELP.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:48.533
AND IN ORDER TA DO DAT,
I NEED TO WIN.

00:09:48.533 --> 00:09:52.373
Valon, voice-over:
THIS GUY'S EVEN TOUGHER
THAN I THOUGHT.

00:09:52.373 --> 00:09:58.284
I'VE NEVA FACED
AN OPPONENT WITH THIS MUCH
DETERMINATION BEFORE.

00:09:58.284 --> 00:10:02.959
AFTER WHAT I PUT HIM THROUGH,
HE SHOULDA GIVEN UP BY NOW.

00:10:02.959 --> 00:10:05.397
TIME TA TAKE CONTROL
'A DIS DUEL,

00:10:05.397 --> 00:10:07.133
SO LOOK OUT!

00:10:07.133 --> 00:10:10.072
THERE'S TOO MUCH
AT STAKE FOR ME TA LOSE.

00:10:14.981 --> 00:10:17.052
Mai, voice-over:
YOU'RE MINE, WHEELER.

00:10:21.827 --> 00:10:23.096
Mokuba, voice-over:
I LIKE THIS ONE.

00:10:23.096 --> 00:10:24.332
Kaiba, voice-over: FINE.

00:10:24.332 --> 00:10:26.435
WE DON'T HAVE ANY TIME
TO SHOP AROUND, ANYWAY.

00:10:26.435 --> 00:10:29.174
GET IN MOKUBA.

00:10:29.174 --> 00:10:30.777
LET'S PAY DARTZ
A VISIT.

00:10:30.777 --> 00:10:32.346
SOUNDS GOOD TA ME.

00:10:32.346 --> 00:10:34.150
Man:
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:36.053
WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING
IN THIS CAR?

00:10:36.053 --> 00:10:37.589
Mokuba:
WHATTA YA THINK
WE'RE DOING?

00:10:37.589 --> 00:10:39.092
WE'RE BUYING IT.

00:10:39.092 --> 00:10:40.328
WHAT?

00:10:40.328 --> 00:10:42.799
I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO PLAY GAMES YOUNG MAN.

00:10:42.799 --> 00:10:45.770
Kaiba: I THINK
THIS SHOULD COVER IT.

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:47.441
KEEP THE CHANGE.

00:10:47.441 --> 00:10:51.781
GET BACK HERE!

00:10:51.781 --> 00:10:55.054
THERE GOES MY JOB...

00:10:55.054 --> 00:10:59.563
OR MAYBE NOT.

00:10:59.563 --> 00:11:00.765
GREAT IDEA.

00:11:00.765 --> 00:11:04.538
BEATS TAKING THE BUS.

00:11:04.538 --> 00:11:05.540
Kaiba, voice-over:
I HAVE A FEELING

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:08.045
WHEELER'S IN TROUBLE
AGAIN,

00:11:08.045 --> 00:11:10.516
BUT I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO BAIL THAT CHUMP OUT.

00:11:10.516 --> 00:11:12.552
I HAVE BIGGER THINGS
TO DEAL WITH.

00:11:26.508 --> 00:11:28.278
Valon:
TOO WEAK TO MAKE A MOVE?

00:11:28.278 --> 00:11:29.847
Joey: I DON'T THINK SO.

00:11:29.847 --> 00:11:33.020
I PLAY THIS FACE DOWN
AND END MY TURN.

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:35.191
SO I GUESS YOU COULDN'T
FIND A MONSTA

00:11:35.191 --> 00:11:37.528
THAT WAS STRONG ENOUGH
TO TAKE ME DOWN.

00:11:37.528 --> 00:11:40.100
THAT MEANS YOUR LIFE POINTS
ARE WIDE OPEN, MATE,

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:43.773
AND I'VE GOT JUST THE THING
TO HELP ME SMASH THEM
TO SMITHEREENS

00:11:43.773 --> 00:11:46.544
AND END THIS DUEL ALREADY.

00:11:46.544 --> 00:11:47.847
HERE GOES.

00:11:47.847 --> 00:11:51.754
I SUMMON
MY BLACK HOLE SHIELD
IN ATTACK MODE.

00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:03.375
THIS GIVES MY BURNING KNUCKLE
200 EXTRA ATTACK POINTS.

00:12:03.375 --> 00:12:06.147
Computer: SCANNING
OPPONENT'S PLAYING FIELD.

00:12:06.147 --> 00:12:08.651
MONSTER CARDS: ZERO.

00:12:08.651 --> 00:12:11.122
FACE DOWN CARDS: ONE.

00:12:11.122 --> 00:12:14.462
SAY GOOD-BYE
TO THE REST OF YOUR
LIFE POINTS, WHEELER.

00:12:14.462 --> 00:12:18.637
BURNING KNUCKLE,
ATTACK WITH IRON FIST
UPPERCUT!

00:12:18.637 --> 00:12:20.706
IT'S ALL OVER!

00:12:25.782 --> 00:12:30.224
NO WAY!

00:12:30.224 --> 00:12:31.894
YA THOUGHT
YOU WERE THE ONLY ONE

00:12:31.894 --> 00:12:35.901
WITH A SPACE SUIT,
DIDN'T YA?

00:12:35.901 --> 00:12:39.341
WELL, YOU ACTIVATED
MY AURA ARMOR TRAP CARD.

00:12:39.341 --> 00:12:41.912
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDIN' ME.

00:12:41.912 --> 00:12:45.084
Computer:
DETECTING RIVAL ARMOR.

00:12:45.084 --> 00:12:47.021
I DECIDED THE ONLY WAY
TO BEAT YOU

00:12:47.021 --> 00:12:48.724
WAS TO FIGHT
ARMOR WIT ARMOR.

00:12:48.724 --> 00:12:51.897
YA SEE, WHEN AURA ARMOR
IS ON DA FIELD
AND I GET ATTACKED,

00:12:51.897 --> 00:12:54.835
IT ACTIVATES
IF I HAVE UNDER 2000
LIFE POINTS.

00:12:54.835 --> 00:12:56.239
SURE I HAD TO GIVE UP

00:12:56.239 --> 00:12:57.908
HALF 'A THOSE
LIFE POINTS
IN ORDER TO USE IT,

00:12:57.908 --> 00:13:02.416
BUT AS AN ADDED BONUS
I WAS ABLE TO CANCEL OUT
YOUR LAST ATTACK--

00:13:02.416 --> 00:13:04.253
AND GET
THIS SNAZZY SUIT.

00:13:04.253 --> 00:13:06.757
WHY DONCHA TRY
SOMETHING ORIGINAL, HUH?

00:13:06.757 --> 00:13:08.828
'CAUSE NOBODY LIKES
A WANNA-BE.

00:13:08.828 --> 00:13:11.432
DON'T WORRY,
MY ARMOR'S DIFFERENT
THAN YOURS.

00:13:11.432 --> 00:13:13.770
MINE IS DIRECTLY LINKED
TO MY LIFE POINTS,

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:15.941
SO WHEN IT
GETS DESTROYED, I LOSE.

00:13:15.941 --> 00:13:17.710
SO HOW'S DAT
FOR ORIGINAL, HUH?

00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:19.881
NOW, LET'S GO.

00:13:19.881 --> 00:13:20.950
I SEE.

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:23.087
ONE MORE ROUND
AND ONE MORE ATTACK.

00:13:23.087 --> 00:13:25.358
LAST MAN STANDING
WINS THE DUEL.

00:13:25.358 --> 00:13:26.861
I'M IN.

00:13:26.861 --> 00:13:29.565
I LAY ONE CARD FACE DOWN.

00:13:33.005 --> 00:13:35.543
Yami-Yugi, voice-over:
JOEY MUST HAVE SUMMONED
HIS LEGENDARY DRAGON.

00:13:35.543 --> 00:13:37.881
THAT'S WHY MINE WAS GLOWING.

00:13:37.881 --> 00:13:42.890
BUT WHY DID THE LIGHT FADE?

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:44.225
MY MOVE!

00:13:44.225 --> 00:13:45.494
COME ON!

00:13:45.494 --> 00:13:46.663
BINGO.

00:13:46.663 --> 00:13:48.333
NOW CHECK DIS OUT.

00:13:48.333 --> 00:13:53.343
I ACTIVATE ROLL OF FATE!

00:13:53.343 --> 00:13:54.912
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.

00:13:54.912 --> 00:13:56.715
WHATEVER NUMBER
THE DIE LANDS ON,

00:13:56.715 --> 00:13:58.618
I GET TO PICK UP
THAT MANY CARDS,

00:13:58.618 --> 00:14:03.227
BUT I ALSO HAFTA
SEND THAT MANY CARDS
TO THE GRAVE.

00:14:03.227 --> 00:14:05.263
YES! 4!

00:14:12.143 --> 00:14:14.147
Valon, voice-over:
WHAT'S THIS BLOKE UP TO?

00:14:14.147 --> 00:14:17.653
A'RIGHT, I'M GONNA START
DINGS OFF WIT DIS--

00:14:17.653 --> 00:14:20.892
THE MAGIC CARD
RED-EYES TRANSMIGRATION!

00:14:20.892 --> 00:14:24.599
ALL I HAVE TO DO
IS SACRIFICE MY RED-EYES
BLACK DRAGON

00:14:24.599 --> 00:14:26.102
AND YOU'RE DONE.

00:14:26.102 --> 00:14:28.272
IT'S DAT SIMPLE.

00:14:28.272 --> 00:14:30.076
HE'S NOT EVEN ON THE FIELD!

00:14:30.076 --> 00:14:32.547
BUT HE'S IN MY HAND.

00:14:32.547 --> 00:14:36.654
SO I SACRIFICE
MY RED-EYES BLACK DRAGON
AND MY NEW ARMOR CARD

00:14:36.654 --> 00:14:39.460
SO I CAN PLAY
LORD OF THE RED!

00:14:58.727 --> 00:15:00.965
WHAT IN THE WORLD?

00:15:00.965 --> 00:15:06.275
YEAH!

00:15:06.275 --> 00:15:07.344
WHATTA YA THINK?

00:15:07.344 --> 00:15:10.783
I KNOW, YA NEED
A CLOSER LOOK, RIGHT?

00:15:10.783 --> 00:15:13.087
LORD OF THE RED, ATTACK!

00:15:19.533 --> 00:15:22.304
THERE'S NO WAY OUT
THIS TIME!

00:15:22.304 --> 00:15:26.145
THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK!

00:15:26.145 --> 00:15:31.822
GO, BLACK HOLE SHIELD!

00:15:31.822 --> 00:15:37.465
HEY, WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

00:15:37.465 --> 00:15:38.968
YOUR ATTACK FAILED.

00:15:38.968 --> 00:15:40.871
BY SACRIFICING MY SHIELD,

00:15:40.871 --> 00:15:44.444
I PROTECTED MY LIFE POINTS
FROM ANY DAMAGE.

00:15:44.444 --> 00:15:45.547
NO!

00:15:45.547 --> 00:15:48.418
I THOUGHT MY STRATEGY
WAS FOOLPROOF.

00:15:48.418 --> 00:15:51.491
OH, WELL, GUESS NOT.

00:15:51.491 --> 00:15:54.931
Valon, voice-over:
I SAVED MYSELF, BUT BARELY.

00:15:54.931 --> 00:15:56.099
LOOK AT ME.

00:15:56.099 --> 00:15:57.502
I'M SHAKIN'.

00:15:57.502 --> 00:16:00.507
THAT'S NEVA HAPPENED TO ME
DURING A BATTLE BEFORE!

00:16:00.507 --> 00:16:05.015
THIS GUY'S PUSHIN' ME
TO MY DUELIN' LIMITS.

00:16:05.015 --> 00:16:06.484
COME TO THINK OF IT,

00:16:06.484 --> 00:16:09.657
THIS COULD BE
THE GREATEST CHALLENGE
I'VE EVER FACED.

00:16:09.657 --> 00:16:11.293
YA KNOW WHAT, WHEELER?

00:16:11.293 --> 00:16:14.666
I GOTTA ADMIT,
YOU'RE PUTTIN' UP
QUITE A FIGHT.

00:16:14.666 --> 00:16:15.668
YOU, TOO.

00:16:15.668 --> 00:16:17.404
BUTCHA KNOW WHAT, PAL?

00:16:17.404 --> 00:16:19.408
I'M NOT FIGHTIN'
FOR FUN.

00:16:19.408 --> 00:16:22.013
DIS IS ABOUT
SAVIN' MY FRIENDS.

00:16:27.087 --> 00:16:28.322
Valon: HEY, MAI!

00:16:28.322 --> 00:16:30.160
YOU'RE JUST IN TIME
TO CATCH THE END

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.330
OF THE GREATEST DUEL
EVER PLAYED.

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:34.433
YOU AND I HAD A DEAL,
REMEMBER?

00:16:34.433 --> 00:16:36.938
JOEY WHEELER'S MINE.

00:16:36.938 --> 00:16:38.375
MAI, NO!

00:16:38.375 --> 00:16:40.111
LOOK, YOU'VE DONE ENOUGH,

00:16:40.111 --> 00:16:42.382
SO WHY DONCHA TAKE A HIKE
AND LET ME FINISH THIS?

00:16:42.382 --> 00:16:45.320
SORRY, NO CAN DO.

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:48.760
I'M HAVIN'
WAY TOO MUCH FUN OUT HERE
TA STOP NOW.

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:51.031
PLUS, THIS DUEL
IS NO PLACE FOR YOU.

00:16:51.031 --> 00:16:52.700
WHY'S THAT?

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:54.437
THERE'S TOO MUCH AT STAKE.

00:16:54.437 --> 00:16:57.610
I WON'T LET YOU RISK
LOSING EVERYTHING YOU HAVE.

00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:00.381
THAT'S WHY I CHALLENGED
WHEELER IN THE FIRST PLACE--

00:17:00.381 --> 00:17:02.418
TO PROTECT YOU.

00:17:02.418 --> 00:17:06.693
I WANTED TO GET RID OF HIM
SO YOU'D BE ABLE TO
MOVE ON WITH YOUR LIFE,

00:17:06.693 --> 00:17:09.799
AND THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

00:17:09.799 --> 00:17:11.034
GUESS WHAT.

00:17:11.034 --> 00:17:13.372
I'M FIGHTIN'
FOR THE SAME REASON.

00:17:13.372 --> 00:17:14.874
THEN LET'S
GET ON WITH IT!

00:17:14.874 --> 00:17:18.514
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE
WHAT YOU PLAY NEXT.

00:17:18.514 --> 00:17:20.584
YOU'RE GONNA HAFTA WAIT,
PAL,

00:17:20.584 --> 00:17:23.457
'CAUSE I PLAY
ONE CARD FACE DOWN
AND END MY TURN.

00:17:23.457 --> 00:17:26.462
BIG MISTAKE, PAL.

00:17:26.462 --> 00:17:29.201
I ACTIVATE MONSTER REBORN,

00:17:29.201 --> 00:17:32.673
WHICH LETS ME BRING BACK
BUSTER PYLE.

00:17:41.155 --> 00:17:44.762
HERE COMES THE LAST ATTACK
OF THE DUEL, WHEELER.

00:17:44.762 --> 00:17:45.764
NOT QUITE.

00:17:45.764 --> 00:17:46.999
I HAVE THIS!

00:17:46.999 --> 00:17:52.243
I ACTIVATE
MY SCAPEGOAT MAGIC CARD.

00:17:52.243 --> 00:17:53.478
OH, COME ON.

00:17:53.478 --> 00:17:56.150
THOSE PIPSQUEAKS
CAN'T BLOCK MY FIST OF IRON.

00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:57.552
WELL, IT'S A GOOD THING

00:17:57.552 --> 00:18:00.424
THAT'S NOT WHAT
I'M TRYIN' TA DO,
ISN'T IT?

00:18:00.424 --> 00:18:02.428
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:10.241
MY ARMOR'S GOT
A SPECIAL POWER, TOO.

00:18:10.241 --> 00:18:14.383
LORD OF THE RED IS ABLE
TO AUTOMATICALLY DESTROY

00:18:14.383 --> 00:18:16.887
EVERY OTHER MONSTER ON THE FIELD
WHENEVER TWO MAGIC CARDS

00:18:16.887 --> 00:18:18.023
ARE PLAYED IN ONE TURN.

00:18:18.023 --> 00:18:19.192
HOLD ON!

00:18:19.192 --> 00:18:20.427
TWO CARDS?

00:18:20.427 --> 00:18:22.732
BUT YOU ONLY PLAYED
ONE CARD!

00:18:22.732 --> 00:18:25.303
TRUE, BUT YOU PLAYED
MONSTER REBORN,

00:18:25.303 --> 00:18:28.007
WHICH COUNTS AS
THE SECOND MAGIC CARD
I NEEDED.

00:18:28.007 --> 00:18:32.850
Valon: NO!

00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:34.754
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

00:18:34.754 --> 00:18:40.029
I KNOW YOU'RE BLUFFIN',
WHEELER!

00:18:40.029 --> 00:18:42.968
THERE'S NO WAY YOUR ARMOR
CAN BEAT MINE.

00:19:11.287 --> 00:19:13.624
STILL THINK
I WAS BLUFFIN'?

00:19:17.731 --> 00:19:19.267
MY ARMOR'S GONE,

00:19:19.267 --> 00:19:21.738
BUT I STILL HAVE
A FEW LIFE POINTS LEFT,

00:19:21.738 --> 00:19:23.876
SO THIS DUEL'S STILL ON.

00:19:23.876 --> 00:19:26.747
COME ON,
GIMME EVERYTHING
YOU'VE GOT.

00:19:26.747 --> 00:19:28.251
IF YOU SAY SO.

00:19:28.251 --> 00:19:31.122
HERE GOES.

00:19:31.122 --> 00:19:33.393
IT'S BEEN NICE
KNOWIN' YA.

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:38.903
NOT SO FAST.

00:19:38.903 --> 00:19:40.406
ACTIVATE TRAP!

00:19:40.406 --> 00:19:42.376
EXTINCTION FIST!

00:19:42.376 --> 00:19:45.983
THIS CARD ALLOWS ME
TO NEUTRALIZE YOUR ATTACK
RIGHT ON THE SPOT

00:19:45.983 --> 00:19:51.927
AND RID THE FIELD
OF YOUR LORD OF THE RED.

00:19:51.927 --> 00:19:54.532
GO, EXTINCTION FIST!

00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:06.487
IT WAS A GOOD EFFORT.

00:20:06.487 --> 00:20:11.462
UNFORTUNATELY FOR YOU,
I WAS ONE STEP AHEAD AGAIN.

00:20:15.169 --> 00:20:17.674
WELL, I GOTTA HAND IT
TO YA, PAL,

00:20:17.674 --> 00:20:21.113
I DIDN'T SEE THAT ONE
COMIN'.

00:20:21.113 --> 00:20:24.019
WELL, THAT WAS THE POINT.

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:35.373
Mai, voice-over:
THIS IS IT.

00:20:35.373 --> 00:20:37.877
THEY'RE BOTH ONE ATTACK
AWAY FROM DEFEAT.

00:20:37.877 --> 00:20:39.474
IN THE NEXT ROUND,

00:20:39.474 --> 00:20:42.610
ONE OF THEM'S GONNA BE
TRAPPED BY THE SEAL FOREVER.
