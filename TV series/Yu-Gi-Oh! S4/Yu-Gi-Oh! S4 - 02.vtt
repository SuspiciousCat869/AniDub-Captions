00:08:53.803 --> 00:08:56.975
WHICH GIVES HIS MONSTERS
AN INSTANT POWER BOOST.

00:08:56.975 --> 00:08:58.845
Yami-Yugi:
NOW I PLAY WATAPON!

00:08:58.845 --> 00:09:02.085
IT'S STILL MY TURN.

00:09:02.085 --> 00:09:03.620
I'M AWARE OF THAT,

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:05.691
BUT WATAPON'S
SPECIAL ABILITY

00:09:05.691 --> 00:09:08.897
ALLOWS ME TO
AUTOMATICALLY SUMMON IT
TO THE FIELD

00:09:08.897 --> 00:09:10.633
AS SOON AS I DRAW IT.

00:09:10.633 --> 00:09:13.740
HAA! THAT CARD'S
USELESS ANYWAY----

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:15.576
UNLIKE THIS,

00:09:15.576 --> 00:09:20.051
MY WARRIOR
DAI GREPHER.

00:09:20.051 --> 00:09:21.754
AND THANKS TO THE ORICHALCOS,

00:09:21.754 --> 00:09:23.324
HE GAINS 500 POINTS.

00:09:23.324 --> 00:09:26.830
YOU'VE ACTIVATED
MY TRAP!

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:30.704
BEHOLD,
DARK RENEWAL!

00:09:30.704 --> 00:09:33.709
THANKS TO THIS CARD,
I NOW HAVE THE ABILITY

00:09:33.709 --> 00:09:36.715
TO SACRIFICE
ONE OF YOUR MONSTERS
IN ADDITION TO MINE.

00:09:44.797 --> 00:09:49.672
NOW I CAN BRING
A SPELLCASTER BACK
FROM MY GRAVEYARD,

00:09:49.672 --> 00:09:54.948
AND I CHOOSE
MY DARK MAGICIAN.

00:09:54.948 --> 00:09:56.017
BUT HOW?

00:09:56.017 --> 00:09:57.921
THIS MUST BE
SOME SORT OF TRICK.

00:09:57.921 --> 00:10:00.625
I NEVER SENT
YOUR DARK MAGICIAN
TO THE CARD GRAVEYARD.

00:10:00.625 --> 00:10:02.562
NO, BUT I DID

00:10:02.562 --> 00:10:05.568
WHEN I PLAYED
MY GRACEFUL CHARITY
MAGIC CARD.

00:10:05.568 --> 00:10:09.107
NOW HE'S BACK,
AND YOU HAVE NO MONSTERS
TO PROTECT YOU.

00:10:09.107 --> 00:10:10.176
HA!

00:10:10.176 --> 00:10:14.150
THIS FACEDOWN CARD
IS ALL I NEED.

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:15.352
OH, YEAH!

00:10:15.352 --> 00:10:17.289
YUGI'S GONNA
CLEAN HOUSE NOW.

00:10:17.289 --> 00:10:20.161
YOU'RE DONE.

00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:22.532

DARK MAGICIAN!

00:10:22.532 --> 00:10:24.336

HIS LIFE POINTS.

00:10:24.336 --> 00:10:28.276
ACTIVATE SHIELD WALL.

00:10:28.276 --> 00:10:29.378
WHAT'S THAT?

00:10:29.378 --> 00:10:32.283
IT'S QUITE A HANDY
MAGIC CARD.

00:10:32.283 --> 00:10:36.858
SHIELD WALL
REINFORCES MY DEFENSE
WITH 4 NEW MONSTERS.

00:10:36.858 --> 00:10:39.864
YOUR DARK MAGICIAN
WILL NEVER GET
TO MY LIFE POINTS.

00:10:39.864 --> 00:10:41.333
NO.

00:10:41.333 --> 00:10:43.136
HEH HEH! I'M AFRAID SO,

00:10:43.136 --> 00:10:45.107
BUT JUST TO MAKE SURE,

00:10:45.107 --> 00:10:49.114
I THINK I'LL SUMMON
A FEW MORE MONSTERS
TO THE FIELD NOW

00:10:49.114 --> 00:10:54.324
BY UTILIZING THE POWER
OF MY BRONZE KNIGHTS
MAGIC CARD.

00:10:54.324 --> 00:10:57.095
NOW I DISCARD 3 CARDS
FROM MY HAND

00:10:57.095 --> 00:10:58.933
IN ORDER TO SUMMON

00:10:58.933 --> 00:11:00.268
3 BRONZE KNIGHTS

00:11:00.268 --> 00:11:01.704
TO THE FIELD.

00:11:01.704 --> 00:11:03.006
HOLD ON.

00:11:03.006 --> 00:11:04.710
YOU HAVE 6 MONSTERS.

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:06.179
[CHUCKLES]

00:11:06.179 --> 00:11:07.682
THAT'S CHEATING, PAL.

00:11:07.682 --> 00:11:09.117
CHECK DA RULES.

00:11:09.117 --> 00:11:12.290
PAGE 3 OF
THE DUELIST HANDBOOK
CLEARLY STATES,

00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:15.797
"ONLY 5 MONSTERS PER
DUELIST CAN BE
IN PLAY AT ONCE."

00:11:15.797 --> 00:11:18.134
Biker: YOU BETTER
GET YOURSELF
A NEW RULEBOOK,

00:11:18.134 --> 00:11:20.806
'CAUSE IT SOUNDS
LIKE YOURS
IS OUTDATED.

00:11:20.806 --> 00:11:23.711
THE SEAL OF
ORICHALCOS DOUBLES

00:11:23.711 --> 00:11:25.414
THE NUMBER
OF MONSTERS

00:11:25.414 --> 00:11:27.652
ITS HOLDER IS ALLOWED
TO HAVE ON THE FIELD.

00:11:27.652 --> 00:11:29.823
NO WAY.

00:11:29.823 --> 00:11:33.563
THAT MEANS THIS CREEPAZOID
CAN HAVE UP TO 10 MONSTERS
IN PLAY AT ONE TIME.

00:11:33.563 --> 00:11:34.932
CORRECT.

00:11:34.932 --> 00:11:37.603
AND YOU CAN'T ATTACK
MY BACK ROW OF MONSTERS

00:11:37.603 --> 00:11:40.508
WITHOUT FIRST GOING
THROUGH THE FRONT ROW.

00:11:40.508 --> 00:11:42.078
WHAT?

00:11:42.078 --> 00:11:46.486
AND SINCE EVERY
ONE OF MY MONSTERS GAINS
500 EXTRA ATTACK POINTS,

00:11:46.486 --> 00:11:50.460
YOU'LL NEVER TAKE THEM DOWN.

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:55.703
YOUR LONE DARK MAGICIAN
IS NOTHING COMPARED
TO MY ARMY OF CREATURES.

00:11:55.703 --> 00:11:58.241
SAY FAREWELL
TO YOUR SOUL.

00:12:02.848 --> 00:12:04.786
THE ANCIENT MAGIC
THAT ENCIRCLES US

00:12:04.786 --> 00:12:07.590
AFFORDS ME POWERS
YOU COULD NEVER DREAM OF.

00:12:09.461 --> 00:12:11.230
IT'S MY MOVE,

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:13.635
SO I PLACE
TWO CARDS FACEDOWN

00:12:13.635 --> 00:12:16.406
AND SUMMON
QUEEN'S KNIGHT
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:12:16.406 --> 00:12:17.408
VERY WELL.

00:12:17.408 --> 00:12:18.912
NOW WATCH THIS.

00:12:18.912 --> 00:12:20.581
I'M NOT FINISHED
JUST YET.

00:12:20.581 --> 00:12:21.650
WHAT?

00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:24.923
I ACTIVATE
DUST TORNADO.

00:12:24.923 --> 00:12:29.330
THIS GREAT STORM
CAN WIPE OUT ANY MAGIC
OR TRAP CARD I CHOOSE.

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:31.301
NOW, DUST TORNADO,

00:12:31.301 --> 00:12:36.710
ELIMINATE
HIS SEAL OF ORICHALCOS
WITH YOUR MIGHTY WINDS!

00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:41.452
Joey: OL' RED EYES
WON'T BE SO TOUGH
WHEN THIS BLOWS OVER.

00:12:43.456 --> 00:12:45.293

00:12:46.328 --> 00:12:47.330
OH, NO.

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:48.800
IT WASN'T DESTROYED.

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:51.204
DOESN'T HE REALIZE
THE SACRED SEAL

00:12:51.204 --> 00:12:54.509
IS WAY TOO POWERFUL
TO BE BROKEN BY
A MEASLY TRAP CARD?

00:12:54.509 --> 00:12:56.680
I GUESS HE'S
A SLOW LEARNER.

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:58.684
NOW, TAKE THIS.

00:12:58.684 --> 00:13:01.957
IT'S CALLED THE WARRIOR
RETURNING ALIVE.

00:13:01.957 --> 00:13:07.367
IT BRINGS BACK
MY LOST SOLDIER
DAI GREPHER.

00:13:07.367 --> 00:13:09.771
AND LIKE EVERY ONE
OF MY MONSTERS,

00:13:09.771 --> 00:13:16.049

NOT ONLY DOES THIS CARD
GRANT MY NEW SOLDIER
AN EXTRA 800 ATTACK POINTS,

00:13:25.566 --> 00:13:28.572
IT INCREASES THE POWER
OF MY 3 BRONZE KNIGHTS

TO REPLACE HER

WITH MY DARK
MAGICIAN GIRL.

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:02.034

A FEW EXTRA POINTS

HIS SOUL WAS TRAPPED
IN THIS CARD.

00:17:04.969 --> 00:17:07.874
BUT WHERE DOES THIS
POWER COME FROM?

00:17:07.874 --> 00:17:11.381
CHECK THIS OUT, YUGI.

00:17:11.381 --> 00:17:13.385
IT WAS AROUND
THAT GUY'S NECK.

00:17:13.385 --> 00:17:16.491
DO YOU THINK
IT HAS SOMETHING
TO DO WITH ALL THIS?

00:17:21.823 --> 00:17:23.894
TAKE YOUR PAWS OFF ME,
YOU SASQUATCH.

00:17:23.894 --> 00:17:25.998
YEAH, DON'T MAKE ME
GET ALL NINJA
ON YOUR BUTT.

00:17:25.998 --> 00:17:28.336
I GOT AN IDEA, DUDE.

00:17:28.336 --> 00:17:30.506
SEE HOW FAR
WE CAN TOSS THESE DWEEBS?

00:17:30.506 --> 00:17:32.176
Yugi: HOLD ON
A SECOND, GUYS.

00:17:32.176 --> 00:17:34.981
WE GOTTA FIND OUT
WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM.

00:17:34.981 --> 00:17:36.751
ALL RIGHT, NOW TRY
TO REMEMBER

00:17:36.751 --> 00:17:38.354
EVERYTHING
YOU GUYS DID YESTERDAY.

00:17:38.354 --> 00:17:40.558
FIRST I WOKE UP
AND WENT TO THE BATHROOM.

00:17:40.558 --> 00:17:42.361
HE MEANS AFTER THAT.

00:17:42.361 --> 00:17:44.799
EVER HEAR
OF STEPPING ASIDE?

00:17:44.799 --> 00:17:46.067
YEAH, WHAT'S
YOUR PROBLEM?

00:17:46.067 --> 00:17:48.138
THE PROBLEM SHALL BE YOURS,

00:17:48.138 --> 00:17:51.044
WHEN I STRIP YOU TWO FOOLS
OF YOUR SOULS.

00:17:51.044 --> 00:17:54.216
DOES THE GRIM REAPER KNOW
YOU RAIDED HIS WARDROBE?

00:17:54.216 --> 00:17:57.722
QUOD VALEDICO
VESTRUM ANIMUS.

00:17:57.722 --> 00:18:00.527
I TH-THINK
YOU JUST
GOT HIM MAD.

00:18:00.527 --> 00:18:02.531
RISE TO YOUR FEET

00:18:02.531 --> 00:18:05.002
AND DUEL.

00:18:05.002 --> 00:18:07.040
AFTER THAT, WE ALL DUELED,

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:09.644
AND HE SQUASHED WEEVIL
LIKE A COCKROACH.

00:18:09.644 --> 00:18:11.147
REX WAS HOLDING US BACK.

00:18:11.147 --> 00:18:12.584
I WOULD HAVE WON,

00:18:12.584 --> 00:18:13.986
BUT THE GUY PLAYED

00:18:13.986 --> 00:18:15.489
SOME WEIRD CARD CALLED

00:18:15.489 --> 00:18:16.991
THE SEAL OF SOMETHING.

00:18:16.991 --> 00:18:19.095
THE SEAL
OF ORICHALCOS?

00:18:19.095 --> 00:18:20.966
YEAH. THAT'S IT.

00:18:20.966 --> 00:18:23.604
AND I THOUGHT IT
WAS ONE OF THOSE FAKE
KNOCK-OFF CARDS.

00:18:23.604 --> 00:18:25.941
HE DIDN'T HAPPEN
TO MENTION ANYTHING

00:18:25.941 --> 00:18:28.980
ABOUT A PLAN TO STEAL
THE 3 EGYPTIAN
GOD CARDS, DID HE?

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:30.082
WAIT. THEY'RE GONE?

00:18:30.082 --> 00:18:31.652
HE TOOK 'EM.

00:18:31.652 --> 00:18:33.555
WELL, HE AND HIS GANG
OF THUGS DID.

00:18:33.555 --> 00:18:35.459
NO WAY.
SERIOUSLY?

00:18:35.459 --> 00:18:36.728
SERIOUSLY.

00:18:36.728 --> 00:18:39.933
HEY. WE'LL WIN 'EM BACK
1, 2, 3.

00:18:39.933 --> 00:18:41.603
AND YOU TWO BETTER TELL US

00:18:41.603 --> 00:18:44.608
IF YA SEE 3 SUSPICIOUS-LOOKIN'
BIKER PUNKS, ALL RIGHT?

00:18:44.608 --> 00:18:45.677
SURE, WE WILL.

00:18:45.677 --> 00:18:47.848
YOU'LL BE
THE FIRST TO KNOW.

00:18:47.848 --> 00:18:50.119
[CHUCKLES]

00:18:50.119 --> 00:18:51.321
OR NOT.

00:18:51.321 --> 00:18:52.523
ALL RIGHT.

00:18:52.523 --> 00:18:55.529
THE 3 EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS
ARE UP FOR GRABS..

00:18:55.529 --> 00:18:58.000
Both:
SOON THEY'LL BE ALL MINE.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.738
HUH?
HMPH.

00:19:00.738 --> 00:19:03.143
Tristan:
FIRST, THINGS GOT FREAKY
AT THE MUSEUM,

00:19:03.143 --> 00:19:05.581
THEN MONSTERS
STARTED APPEARING
AROUND THE WORLD,

00:19:05.581 --> 00:19:10.423
AND NOW A GANG OF BIKERS
ARE STEALING PEOPLE'S SOULS
WITH A DUEL MONSTERS CARD.

00:19:10.423 --> 00:19:11.925
I'M THINKING
ALL THOSE THINGS

00:19:11.925 --> 00:19:13.562
HAVE SOMETHING TO DO
WITH ONE ANOTHER.

00:19:13.562 --> 00:19:15.332
YEAH, REALLY?

00:19:15.332 --> 00:19:18.938
I'M THINKIN', "WHY DOES
ALL OF THIS WEIRD STUFF
ALWAYS HAPPEN TO US?"

00:19:18.938 --> 00:19:20.875
YOU GOTTA ADMIT,
IT'S TRUE.

00:19:20.875 --> 00:19:22.545
Girl: HEY, YUGI!

00:19:22.545 --> 00:19:25.718
I'VE BEEN LOOKING
ALL OVER FOR YOU.

00:19:25.718 --> 00:19:27.721
UM, HI...YOU.

00:19:27.721 --> 00:19:29.424
OH, NO.

00:19:29.424 --> 00:19:31.260
DON'T TELL ME
YOU FORGOT ABOUT ME

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:34.834
NOW THAT YOU'RE A BIG-TIME
CHAMPION DUELIST.

00:19:34.834 --> 00:19:37.406
YUGI, DO YOU
HAVE ANY IDEA
WHO THIS IS?

00:19:37.406 --> 00:19:38.775
LET'S SEE.

00:19:38.775 --> 00:19:40.378
THIS CARD
SHOULD RING A BELL.

00:19:40.378 --> 00:19:45.220
YOU DID GIVE IT TO ME.

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:46.422
REBECCA!

00:19:46.422 --> 00:19:48.426
Yugi: I WANT YOU
TO HAVE THIS.

00:19:48.426 --> 00:19:51.732
THE TIES
OF FRIENDSHIP?

00:19:51.732 --> 00:19:53.235
CONSIDER IT A GIFT.

00:19:53.235 --> 00:19:54.303
AW, THANK YOU.

00:19:54.303 --> 00:19:55.572
OH, NO!

00:19:55.572 --> 00:19:58.711
YOU'RE THAT BRAT.

00:19:58.711 --> 00:20:00.081
HI.

00:20:00.081 --> 00:20:01.149
YOU LOOK DIFFERENT.

00:20:01.149 --> 00:20:02.886
DID YOU GET A HAIRCUT
OR SOMETHING?

00:20:02.886 --> 00:20:06.125
Tristan: NO, SHE
TRADED HER TEDDY BEAR
FOR GLASSES.

00:20:06.125 --> 00:20:07.961
I DON'T NEED
A TEDDY BEAR,

00:20:07.961 --> 00:20:11.735
BECAUSE NOW I HAVE
A BOYFRIEND TO PROTECT ME.

00:20:11.735 --> 00:20:12.737
EXCUSE ME?

00:20:12.737 --> 00:20:14.073
A BOYFRIEND?

00:20:14.073 --> 00:20:17.479
AND YET ANOTHER WEIRD
EVENT TO ADD TO THE LIST.

00:20:17.479 --> 00:20:20.385
YUP, AND THIS ONE
TOPS 'EM ALL.

00:20:20.385 --> 00:20:22.455
PROBABLY BEST
IF WE STAY
OUT OF IT.

00:20:22.455 --> 00:20:23.824
COME ON.

00:20:23.824 --> 00:20:26.663
MY GRANDPA REALLY
WANTS TO SEE YOU ALSO, YUGI.

00:20:26.663 --> 00:20:28.834
PROFESSOR HAWKINS
WANTS TO SEE ME?

00:20:30.903 --> 00:20:32.607
REMARKABLE,
ISN'T IT?

00:20:32.607 --> 00:20:33.943
THAT'S MY BOY.

00:20:33.943 --> 00:20:35.779
Yugi: HEY, GUYS!

00:20:35.779 --> 00:20:37.816
YUGI MOTO.

00:20:37.816 --> 00:20:40.254
YOU'RE JUST THE PERSON
I NEED TO SEE.

00:20:40.254 --> 00:20:43.093
I HAVE A THEORY
THAT ALL OF THESE
MONSTER SIGHTINGS

00:20:43.093 --> 00:20:46.098
HAVE SOMETHING
TO DO WITH YOU.

00:20:53.178 --> 00:20:54.816
HERE WE ARE, GANG,

00:20:54.816 --> 00:20:56.484
HOME, SWEET HOME.

00:20:56.484 --> 00:20:59.587
WAIT 'TIL THE BOSS HEARS
WE FOUND THE PHARAOH.
