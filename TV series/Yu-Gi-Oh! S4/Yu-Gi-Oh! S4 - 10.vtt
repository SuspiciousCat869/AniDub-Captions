HOW'D SHE
DO THAT?

00:08:27.132 --> 00:08:28.467
HOLD ON!

00:08:28.467 --> 00:08:30.070
IT'S THOSE NUMBERS!

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:32.741
JOEY'S HAMMER WAS CREATED
FROM TIME WIZARD,

00:08:32.741 --> 00:08:36.014
SO I HAVE A FEELING IT DIDN'T
DESTROY MAI'S MONSTERS AT ALL,

00:08:36.014 --> 00:08:38.519
BUT RATHER SENT THEM
INTO THE FUTURE!

00:08:38.519 --> 00:08:40.288
OF COURSE.

00:08:40.288 --> 00:08:42.125
NOW, WHY DIDN'T
I THINK OF THAT!?

00:08:42.125 --> 00:08:44.495
EACH ONE WAS TRANSPORTED
FORWARD IN TIME

00:08:44.495 --> 00:08:45.999
BY A DIFFERENT
NUMBER OF TURNS!

00:08:45.999 --> 00:08:48.202
THAT'S WHY ALL THOSE
NUMBERS SHOWED UP

00:08:48.202 --> 00:08:50.073
WHEN JOEY ATTACKED
WITH HIS HAMMER!

00:08:50.073 --> 00:08:51.742
EACH NUMBER MUST
HAVE REPRESENTED

00:08:51.742 --> 00:08:53.913
A FUTURE TURN IN THE DUEL.

00:08:53.913 --> 00:08:55.482
WHICH MEANS MAI'S MONSTERS

00:08:55.482 --> 00:08:57.853
WON'T SHOW UP UNTIL
THAT TURN STARTS!

00:08:57.853 --> 00:08:59.991
UNFORTUNATELY FOR JOEY,

00:08:59.991 --> 00:09:02.729
HARPIE'S PET DRAGON HAD
THE NUMBER ONE ABOVE IT...

00:09:02.729 --> 00:09:05.867
SO IT SHOWED UP FIRST.

00:09:05.867 --> 00:09:07.470

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:10.743

00:09:17.354 --> 00:09:21.428
THERE'S NOT GONNA BE A NEXT
TIME FOR YOU, PRETTY-BOY!

HARPIE'S PET DRAGON,

00:09:22.998 --> 00:09:24.501
DESTROY HIS FIEND NOW!

00:09:24.501 --> 00:09:26.604

IF I WERE HER.

00:15:34.524 --> 00:15:37.930
Tea: JOEY!

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:39.499
NO WAY!

00:15:39.499 --> 00:15:40.902
THIS IS WEIRD.

00:15:40.902 --> 00:15:42.604
UH, YEAH.

00:15:42.604 --> 00:15:45.744
AND I'D SAY
BORDERLINE CREEPY.

00:15:45.744 --> 00:15:47.647
I HATE THESE TOONS.

00:15:47.647 --> 00:15:48.916
LET'S MAKE THIS
VISIT QUICK.

00:15:48.916 --> 00:15:49.918
AH!!

00:15:49.918 --> 00:15:51.153
IT'S THE JACKPOT!

00:15:51.153 --> 00:15:53.925
PEGASUS PROBABLY STASHED
HIS RAREST CARDS IN HERE!

00:15:53.925 --> 00:15:54.993
YEAH!

00:15:54.993 --> 00:15:58.098
THEN WHY ARE WE
STANDING HERE?

00:15:58.098 --> 00:15:59.201
PEGASUS!?

00:15:59.201 --> 00:16:00.503
NOT QUITE.

00:16:00.503 --> 00:16:01.705
IT'S A HOLOGRAM.

00:16:01.705 --> 00:16:03.576
YUGI-BOY!

00:16:03.576 --> 00:16:06.180
AT LEAST I HOPE IT'S YOU
THAT FOUND THIS ROOM.

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:07.816
BY THE WAY,
IF YOU COULDN'T TELL,

00:16:07.816 --> 00:16:10.254
I DID ALL THE INTERIOR
DECORATING MYSELF.

00:16:10.254 --> 00:16:12.190
PRETTY IMPRESSIVE,
ISN'T IT?

00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:14.862
THIS GUY HAS GOTTA
GET OVER HIMSELF.

00:16:14.862 --> 00:16:16.799
KEEP IT DOWN.
I CAN'T HEAR!

00:16:16.799 --> 00:16:19.003
IF YOU'RE HEARING THIS...

00:16:19.003 --> 00:16:22.342
THAT CAN ONLY MEAN
THE GENTLEMEN WHO
ARE AFTER MY SOUL

00:16:22.342 --> 00:16:24.613
WERE FINALLY ABLE
TO CAPTURE ME.

00:16:24.613 --> 00:16:26.717
SO, PLEASE LISTEN CLOSELY.

00:16:26.717 --> 00:16:27.986
THIS IS IT.

00:16:27.986 --> 00:16:30.390
Pegasus: IT ALL BEGAN
WHEN A MYSTERIOUS MAN

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:32.560
TRIED TO BUY OUT
MY COMPANY.

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:33.829
HOLD ON.

00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:35.532
I GOT DRAGGED INTO
THIS WHOLE MESS

00:16:35.532 --> 00:16:38.604
BECAUSE SOMEONE IS TRYING
TO BUY OUT MY COMPANY ALSO.

00:16:38.604 --> 00:16:39.606
THAT'S RIGHT!

00:16:39.606 --> 00:16:41.576
BUT THERE'S MORE...

00:16:41.576 --> 00:16:44.114
THIS INDIVIDUAL POSSESSES
AN ANCIENT POWER

00:16:44.114 --> 00:16:46.151
STRONGER THAN ANY I'VE SEEN.

00:16:46.151 --> 00:16:47.487
AND HIS NAME...

00:16:47.487 --> 00:16:48.555
IS DARTZ.

00:16:48.555 --> 00:16:49.557
[GASPS]

00:16:49.557 --> 00:16:50.558
WHO'S DARTZ?!

00:16:50.558 --> 00:16:51.761
WHO CARES, YUGI...

00:16:51.761 --> 00:16:53.531
Pegasus:
YOU'RE IN DANGER!!

00:16:53.531 --> 00:16:57.138
DARTZ PLANS TO USE MY GAME
TO DESTROY CIVILIZATION.

00:16:57.138 --> 00:16:58.940
HE MUST BE STOPPED.

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:00.576
AND THE KEY TO
TAKING HIM DOWN

00:17:00.576 --> 00:17:02.814
IS SOMEWHERE
IN THIS ROOM!

00:17:07.787 --> 00:17:09.623
Pegasus: EVER SINCE
MY RETIREMENT BEGAN,

00:17:09.623 --> 00:17:11.593
I'VE HAD A LOT OF
TIME ON MY HANDS.

00:17:11.593 --> 00:17:13.496
SO, I BEGAN TO
FURTHER MY STUDIES

00:17:13.496 --> 00:17:16.669
OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIAN
ORIGINS OF DUEL MONSTERS--

00:17:16.669 --> 00:17:19.507
AND I MADE
AN ASTONISHING DISCOVERY.

00:17:19.507 --> 00:17:21.411
THESE CREATURES
EXISTED LONG BEFORE

00:17:21.411 --> 00:17:23.214
THE PYRAMIDS WERE EVEN BUILT!

00:17:23.214 --> 00:17:25.352
IN THE CITY
OF ATLANTIS.

00:17:25.352 --> 00:17:28.924
AND THAT'S WHERE THIS DARTZ
CHARACTER COMES IN.

00:17:28.924 --> 00:17:30.394
HE'S TRYING TO RESURRECT

00:17:30.394 --> 00:17:33.265
THE MOST TERRIFYING BEAST
EVER TO ROAM THE EARTH...

00:17:33.265 --> 00:17:35.703
THE GREAT LEVIATHAN!

00:17:35.703 --> 00:17:38.174
BY DRAINING THE SOULS
OF MAN AND BEAST

00:17:38.174 --> 00:17:39.877
IN ORDER TO BUILD UP
THE STRENGTH

00:17:39.877 --> 00:17:42.682
OF THIS UNSTOPPABLE MONSTER!

00:17:42.682 --> 00:17:44.284
YES,
OF COURSE!

00:17:44.284 --> 00:17:46.455
THE AGE OF DESTRUCTION
IS HERE.

00:17:46.455 --> 00:17:48.826
THE EARTH SHALL BE
SHROUDED IN DARKNESS..

00:17:48.826 --> 00:17:50.429
AND YOUR VERY SOUL

00:17:50.429 --> 00:17:53.769
SHALL FUEL THE FORCE
THAT DEVASTATES MANKIND.

00:17:53.769 --> 00:17:55.037
WHAT DO YOU
MEAN BY THAT?

00:17:55.037 --> 00:17:56.340
[LAUGHING]

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:59.746
A GREAT BEAST IS NOW AWAKENING
FROM ITS ANCIENT SLUMBER

00:17:59.746 --> 00:18:02.818
TO COMPLETE WHAT IT
BEGAN CENTURIES AGO.

00:18:02.818 --> 00:18:04.454
BUT BEFORE IT CAN ARISE,

00:18:04.454 --> 00:18:07.827
IT MUST FEAST
UPON ENOUGH SOULS.

00:18:07.827 --> 00:18:09.797
IF HIS PLAN WORKS...

00:18:09.797 --> 00:18:11.901
DARTZ WILL HAVE
SUCCEEDED IN UNLEASHING

00:18:11.901 --> 00:18:14.372
A TRULY DEVASTATING POWER...

00:18:14.372 --> 00:18:18.779
THE LIKES OF WHICH HAVE NOT
BEEN SEEN FOR 10,000 YEARS.

00:18:18.779 --> 00:18:20.750
YOU'RE OUR ONLY HOPE!

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:24.423
SO, I'VE CREATED AN EXCLUSIVE
CARD JUST FOR YOU, YUGI-BOY!

00:18:24.423 --> 00:18:27.428
Both: NO WAY!

00:18:27.428 --> 00:18:29.866
Pegasus: I'VE HIDDEN
THIS ONE-OF-A-KIND CARD

00:18:29.866 --> 00:18:31.368
SOMEWHERE IN THIS ROOM.

00:18:31.368 --> 00:18:33.306
THINK STRATEGICALLY NOW.

00:18:33.306 --> 00:18:36.611
WHERE CAN ONE FIND
AN EXTRA CARD?

00:18:36.611 --> 00:18:38.248
POT OF GREED!

00:18:38.248 --> 00:18:39.917
IN THE GAME OF
DUEL MONSTERS,

00:18:39.917 --> 00:18:41.787
THAT LETS YOU DRAW
EXTRA CARDS!

00:18:41.787 --> 00:18:44.559
Both: COME TO PAPA!

[GASPS]

00:18:50.035 --> 00:18:53.007
OH, REAL SPECIAL CARD!

00:18:53.007 --> 00:18:55.745
THIS THING'S
COMPLETELY BLANK, GUYS!

00:18:55.745 --> 00:18:57.983
Kaiba:
THEN IT'S WORTHLESS.

00:18:57.983 --> 00:18:59.685
NOT NECESSARILY.

00:18:59.685 --> 00:19:01.222
Pegasus:
TIME IS RUNNING OUT!

00:19:01.222 --> 00:19:04.394
MY CUTE LITTLE
DUEL MONSTERS...

00:19:04.394 --> 00:19:06.063
SOON THEY'LL BE GONE,

00:19:06.063 --> 00:19:07.934
ALONG WITH THE REST
OF THE WORLD.

00:19:07.934 --> 00:19:10.639
ONLY YOU CAN SAVE
THE POOR CREATURES

00:19:10.639 --> 00:19:12.776
THAT MADE MY GAME FAMOUS!

00:19:14.746 --> 00:19:17.517
Tristan: WHOA,
TALK ABOUT DRAMA.

00:19:17.517 --> 00:19:19.187
AW, MAN!

00:19:19.187 --> 00:19:21.057
THIS CAN'T
BE HAPPENING!

00:19:21.057 --> 00:19:23.528
WHY WOULD MAI
JOIN A PLOT TO
DESTROY THE WORLD!??

00:19:23.528 --> 00:19:25.064
I'M TELLING YOU,

00:19:25.064 --> 00:19:27.435
THEY BRAINWASHED
HER OR SOMETHING!

00:19:27.435 --> 00:19:29.071
WHY DON'T YOU ALL WAKE UP?

00:19:29.071 --> 00:19:30.373
HUH?
HUH?
HUH?

00:19:30.373 --> 00:19:31.910
THIS IS A HOAX...

00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:34.013
ALL DESIGNED
BY PEGASUS.

00:19:34.013 --> 00:19:35.817
THERE'S NO ONE
TRAVELING AROUND

00:19:35.817 --> 00:19:39.524
STEALING PEOPLE'S SOULS
WITH SOME MAGIC PLAYING CARD.

00:19:39.524 --> 00:19:43.397
IT'S THE SAME NONSENSE PEGASUS
PULLED IN DUELIST KINGDOM.

00:19:43.397 --> 00:19:45.667
THINK ABOUT IT!

00:19:45.667 --> 00:19:47.338
HE'S TRYING TO DISTRACT ME

00:19:47.338 --> 00:19:49.742
LONG ENOUGH FOR HIM TO
TAKE OVER KAIBA CORP!

00:19:49.742 --> 00:19:51.111
THAT'S ENOUGH!

00:19:51.111 --> 00:19:52.480
YOU SHOULD WAKE UP!

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:54.550
IT'S NOT ALWAYS
ABOUT YOU!

00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:56.220
THERE'S SOMETHING

THAN ALL OF US...

THESE, TOO...

TO DEFEAT THIS
