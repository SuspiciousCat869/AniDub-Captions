00:18:36.265 --> 00:18:38.869
[GASPING]

00:18:38.869 --> 00:18:44.113
YUGI! NO!

00:18:44.113 --> 00:18:47.118
[GRUNTING]

00:18:47.118 --> 00:18:48.287
HUH?

00:18:48.287 --> 00:18:49.689
WHAT?

00:18:49.689 --> 00:18:53.095
IT'S THAT DRAGON
WE RELEASED!

00:18:53.095 --> 00:18:56.068
NOW I SUMMON...TIMAEUS!

00:19:05.251 --> 00:19:07.188
LOOK AT DA SIZE
'A DAT THING!

00:19:07.188 --> 00:19:09.225
TIMAEUS...

00:19:09.225 --> 00:19:12.230
PROTECT US
FROM THAT MONSTER!

00:19:43.656 --> 00:19:45.125
UHH!

00:19:45.125 --> 00:19:48.130
NO.
THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE.

00:20:03.358 --> 00:20:05.228
WE DID IT.

00:20:05.228 --> 00:20:06.431
HUH?

00:20:06.431 --> 00:20:11.173
WE'VE ONLY
JUST BEGUN.

00:20:11.173 --> 00:20:13.309
THE GREAT BEAST
IS STILL WEAK

00:20:13.309 --> 00:20:15.313
SO HE RETREATED
FOR THE MOMENT.

00:20:15.313 --> 00:20:17.317
AND FOR THAT
MY COMPANIONS AND I

00:20:17.317 --> 00:20:19.722
ARE TRULY GRATEFUL
MY PHARAOH.

00:20:19.722 --> 00:20:23.127
BUT MANY OF US
REMAIN PRISONERS
ON THE OTHER SIDE.

00:20:23.127 --> 00:20:24.931
WHAT'S NEXT?

00:20:24.931 --> 00:20:27.629
THE GREAT BEAST
WILL RETURN AGAIN...

00:20:27.629 --> 00:20:29.765
AND HIS POWER WILL GROW!

00:20:29.765 --> 00:20:32.968
HE MUST BE STOPPED
BEFORE HE IS FULLY
RESTORED!

00:20:32.968 --> 00:20:35.971
TIME IS RUNNING OUT!

00:20:43.945 --> 00:20:45.881
Yugi: SEEMS LIKE
TIMAEUS IS STRONG

00:20:45.881 --> 00:20:47.949
BUT NOT STRONG ENOUGH.

00:20:47.949 --> 00:20:50.152
WE MUST RELEASE
THE OTHER TWO DRAGONS.
