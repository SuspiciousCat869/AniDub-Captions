00:09:17.891 --> 00:09:19.559
AND I'VE GOT 5 MINUTES

00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:23.096
PLUS, I CAN SHOW OFF
A FEW 'A MY NEW

00:09:26.099 --> 00:09:27.267
LET'S HAVE A GO.

00:09:27.934 --> 00:09:28.366
HOLD ON!

00:09:28.902 --> 00:09:29.903
IF YOU'RE DUELIN' HER,

00:09:30.136 --> 00:09:32.539
THEN YOU'RE DUELIN' ME,
TOO, TOUGH GUY.

00:09:33.206 --> 00:09:34.207
PEACHY.

00:09:34.808 --> 00:09:38.545

00:09:40.914 --> 00:09:41.915
THIS IS FOR YOU.

00:09:42.348 --> 00:09:44.818
REMEMBER,
DON'T LET HIM PLAY
THE SEAL OF ORICHALCOS.

00:09:45.485 --> 00:09:46.653

00:09:48.588 --> 00:09:49.956
All: LET'S DUEL!

00:09:53.827 --> 00:09:55.562
Duke: WE'RE GONNA
WIPE THE FLOOR WITH YOU.

00:09:56.229 --> 00:09:57.430
YEAH, THEN YOU'RE
GONNA TELL US

00:09:57.964 --> 00:09:59.566

THAT THING'S GOT
NO ATTACK POINTS.

00:10:18.651 --> 00:10:19.686
I DON'T TRUST THIS GUY.

00:10:20.353 --> 00:10:21.921
YEAH, HE MUST BE
UP TO SOMETHING.

00:10:22.589 --> 00:10:23.957
I BET HE WANTS US
TO ATTACK.

00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:25.992
BUT HE'S IN FOR
A DISAPPOINTMENT.

00:10:26.659 --> 00:10:28.995
THAT'S ALL FOR NOW,
KIDS.

00:10:29.662 --> 00:10:31.498
LET THE FUN BEGIN.

00:10:32.165 --> 00:10:35.335
NOW I ACTIVATE THIS,
MY SUMMON DICE MAGIC CARD.

00:10:36.002 --> 00:10:40.106
BUT BEFORE I CAN USE IT
I HAFTA GIVE UP
1000 LIFE POINTS.

00:10:43.943 --> 00:10:45.478
Duke, voice-over:
IF I ROLL A 1 OR A 2,

00:10:45.578 --> 00:10:49.015
I CAN SUMMON TWO MONSTERS
IN ONE TURN.

00:10:49.682 --> 00:10:54.087
IF I ROLL A 3 OR A 4,
I CAN SUMMON A MONSTER
FROM MY GRAVEYARD.

00:10:55.388 --> 00:10:57.857
BUT I REALLY WANT
A 5 OR A 6.

00:11:00.193 --> 00:11:01.194
OH, YEAH!

00:11:01.461 --> 00:11:02.829
NOW I CAN SUMMON
A POWERFUL MONSTER

00:11:03.463 --> 00:11:05.131
WITHOUT SACRIFICING
SOMETHING FIRST.

00:11:05.798 --> 00:11:07.800
MEET ORGOTH
THE RELENTLESS!

00:11:15.141 --> 00:11:17.043
MY TURN TA KICK
A LITTLE BUTT,

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:23.049
STARTING WITH
LUSTER DRAGON ♪2
IN ATTACK MODE.

00:11:23.716 --> 00:11:28.755
THEN I'LL PLACE
ONE CARD FACE DOWN
AND END MY TURN.

00:11:29.422 --> 00:11:30.957
Rebecca, voice-over:
IT'S HIS MOVE NOW.

00:11:31.057 --> 00:11:32.091
THANKS TO OUR MONSTERS,

00:11:32.759 --> 00:11:34.093
WE SHOULD BE READY
FOR ANYTHING.

00:11:34.127 --> 00:11:35.795
Valon:
IT'S SHOW TIME, FOLKS!

00:11:36.462 --> 00:11:41.568
FIRST I ACTIVATE
MY PSYCHIC ARMOR HEAD'S
SPECIAL EFFECT.

00:11:42.235 --> 00:11:43.503
IN CASE YOU'RE WONDERING,

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:46.639
IT ALLOWS ME TO CHOOSE
ANY ARMOR MONSTER
I WANT FROM MY DECK

00:11:47.307 --> 00:11:50.877
AND MOVE IT TO MY HAND.

00:11:51.544 --> 00:11:53.546
THEN I SACRIFICE
MY PSYCHIC ARMOR HEAD

00:11:54.214 --> 00:11:56.449
TO SUMMON
DOUBLE CLOTH ARMOR!

00:12:05.358 --> 00:12:09.162
NEXT I'LL PLACE
ONE CARD FACEDOWN
AND CALL IT QUITS FOR NOW.

00:12:09.829 --> 00:12:11.564
Duke, voice-over:
WHAT'S THIS GUY THINKING?

00:12:12.131 --> 00:12:14.934
HE SUMMONED ANOTHER MONSTER
WITH ZERO ATTACK POINTS.

00:12:15.568 --> 00:12:17.604
SINCE I ALREADY KNOW
I'M GONNA WIN,

00:12:18.271 --> 00:12:19.772
WHY DON'T I HELP
YOU TWO OUT A BIT

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.475
BY TELLIN' YOU
WHAT MY NEW FRIEND CAN DO.

00:12:23.142 --> 00:12:26.012
IF YOU'RE DUMB ENOUGH
TO ATTACK
MY DOUBLE CLOTH ARMOR,

00:12:26.679 --> 00:12:28.348
YOUR MONSTER
WILL AUTOMATICALLY
BE DESTROYED

00:12:28.715 --> 00:12:30.416
RIGHT ON THE SPOT.

00:12:31.084 --> 00:12:32.585
THEN HALF YOUR MONSTER'S
ATTACK POINTS

00:12:33.253 --> 00:12:34.687
ARE SUBTRACTED
FROM YOUR LIFE POINTS.

00:12:35.288 --> 00:12:36.456
Duke, voice-over:
LET'S SEE.

00:12:37.123 --> 00:12:38.958
THAT MEANS IF I ATTACK
HIS DOUBLE CLOTH ARMOR

00:12:39.125 --> 00:12:40.360
WITH MY ORGOTH
THE RELENTLESS,

00:12:40.627 --> 00:12:43.663
I'LL LOSE
1250 LIFE POINTS.

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:46.299
BUT AFTER THAT,
HE'LL HAVE NOTHING
ON THE FIELD

00:12:46.833 --> 00:12:48.635
TO PROTECT HIMSELF.

00:12:49.302 --> 00:12:51.471
THANKS FOR THE TIP,
BIG SHOT.

00:12:52.138 --> 00:12:53.539
I PLACE THIS FACE DOWN.

00:12:54.207 --> 00:12:55.208
FOR THIS TO WORK,

00:12:55.575 --> 00:12:57.143
I'LL NEED
REBECCA'S HELP.

00:13:00.046 --> 00:13:01.047
ALRIGHT, ORGOTH,

00:13:01.581 --> 00:13:03.216
ATTACK
DOUBLE CLOTH ARMOR

00:13:03.883 --> 00:13:06.953
WITH DIAMOND BLADE
STRIKE.

00:13:08.688 --> 00:13:10.323
I WARNED YA.

00:13:19.399 --> 00:13:20.767
ALRIGHT,
TAKE HIM OUT.

00:13:21.401 --> 00:13:22.969
IT'LL BE MY PLEASURE.

00:13:23.636 --> 00:13:25.972
I PLACE ONE CARD FACE
DOWN.

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:28.441
THEN I SACRIFICE
LUSTER DRAGON ♪2

00:13:29.108 --> 00:13:31.778
TO SUMMON THE ORIGINAL
LUSTER DRAGON.

00:13:36.683 --> 00:13:40.019
LUSTER DRAGON,
ATTACK HIS LIFE POINTS
DIRECTLY.

00:13:40.687 --> 00:13:41.988
Valon:
SORRY TO BURST
YOUR BUBBLE,

00:13:42.655 --> 00:13:43.990
BUT I WAS EXPECTING THAT.

00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:46.492
SO, GO, MAGNET ARMOR!

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.795
THIS LITTLE NUMBER
ALLOWS ME TO SUMMON

00:13:49.462 --> 00:13:52.932
ANY ARMOR MONSTER
I WANT FROM MY GRAVEYARD
BACK TO THE FIELD.

00:13:53.599 --> 00:13:54.734
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS...

00:13:55.368 --> 00:13:58.104
MY DOUBLE CLOTH ARMOR
RETURNS!

00:13:58.771 --> 00:14:00.440
OH, NO!

00:14:13.619 --> 00:14:15.955
Valon:
NOW FOR YOUR LIFE POINTS.

00:14:21.094 --> 00:14:22.362
Duke: ARE YOU ALRIGHT?

00:14:23.029 --> 00:14:25.198
I'M FINE,
AND I'VE GOT ONE
TRAP CARD LEFT...

00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:27.767
ROPE OF LIFE!

00:14:28.401 --> 00:14:31.704
I'LL ACTIVATE IT
BY DISCARDING
MY ENTIRE HAND.

00:14:32.372 --> 00:14:35.208
NOW I CAN USE MY ROPE
TO PULL LUSTER DRAGON
OUT OF THE GRAVEYARD

00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:37.009
AND BACK TO THE FIELD.

00:14:37.677 --> 00:14:41.481
BUT THIS TIME,
IT RETURNS WITH 800
EXTRA ATTACK POINTS.

00:14:44.083 --> 00:14:45.084
NICE WORK, BEC.

00:14:45.651 --> 00:14:46.652
I'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE.

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:48.921
I ACTIVATE SWORD REVIVAL.

00:14:49.589 --> 00:14:50.590
HERE'S THE DEAL.

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:53.326
WHENEVER A DRAGON MONSTER
IS REVIVED FROM THE GRAVEYARD,

00:14:53.993 --> 00:14:54.994
THIS CARD KICKS IN.

00:14:55.328 --> 00:14:57.063
IT LETS ME SACRIFICE
THAT DRAGON

00:14:57.730 --> 00:14:59.732
AND SUMMON ANOTHER DRAGON
IN ITS PLACE,

00:15:00.466 --> 00:15:03.770
AND THE NEW DRAGON
BECOMES REBECCA'S MONSTER.

00:15:08.141 --> 00:15:10.476
MEET DIAMOND HEAD DRAGON!

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:21.687
MY DIAMOND HEAD DRAGON
ABSORBS ALL OF LUSTER DRAGON'S
ATTACK POINTS,

00:15:22.355 --> 00:15:26.325
PLUS IT GETS AN EXTRA
1,000 ATTACK POINTS
ON TOP OF THAT.

00:15:28.594 --> 00:15:30.129
THANKS, DUKE,
YOU'RE THE BEST.

REALLY HAVE LOST

AND DOES THAT MEAN
HE'S TRAPPED SOMEWHERE NOW?
