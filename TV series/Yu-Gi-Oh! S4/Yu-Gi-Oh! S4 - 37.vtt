00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.629
IS TRY MY BEST
TO AVOID HIS ATTACKS

00:07:52.629 --> 00:07:55.131
UNTIL I DRAW
THE RIGHT CARD.

00:07:55.131 --> 00:07:58.468

ONE CARD FACEDOWN
AND END MY TURN!

AND YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

00:08:02.572 --> 00:08:08.478

ANOTHER 1,500 LIFE POINTS!

YES, I KNOW.

AND THEN THERE'S MY DEXIA'S
SPECIAL ABILITY,

ITS STRENGTH IS ALWAYS

ORICHALCOS DEXIA!!

00:08:29.766 --> 00:08:34.771
DESTROY HIS OBNOXIOUS
CELTIC GUARDIAN!

00:08:34.771 --> 00:08:37.440
HOLD ON!
REVEAL TRAP!

00:08:42.378 --> 00:08:45.815
ALL I HAVE TO DO NOW
IS GIVE UP HALF
MY LIFE POINTS,

00:08:45.815 --> 00:08:47.784
AND MY SOUL SHIELD
ACTIVATES...

00:08:47.784 --> 00:08:49.452
BLOCKING
YOUR ATTACK!

00:08:54.791 --> 00:08:58.061
NOT BAD.
BUT WHAT'S THE POINT?

00:08:58.061 --> 00:09:01.598
JUST LOOK AROUND YOU.
YOU'RE ALL ALONE.

00:09:01.598 --> 00:09:05.135
YOUR FRIENDS ARE NO LONGER
ABLE TO SUPPORT YOU.

00:09:05.135 --> 00:09:09.005
AND THE SCOREBOARD
DOESN'T EXACTLY POINT IN
YOUR FAVOR, NOW, DOES IT?

00:09:09.005 --> 00:09:11.307
SO WHY DRAG OUT THIS TORMENT

00:09:11.307 --> 00:09:13.776
WHEN ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS FORFEIT?

00:09:13.776 --> 00:09:15.612
ACCEPT YOUR DESTINY,

00:09:15.612 --> 00:09:18.281
AND JOIN YOUR FRIENDS
ON THE OTHER SIDE.

00:09:18.281 --> 00:09:20.316
Thinking:
MAYBE HE'S RIGHT.

00:09:20.316 --> 00:09:22.619
HE DOES HAVE
20,000 LIFE POINTS

00:09:22.619 --> 00:09:25.221
AND 3 INDESTRUCTIBLE
MONSTERS.

00:09:25.221 --> 00:09:28.892
PERHAPS I CAN DO
MORE FOR MY FRIENDS
BY SURRENDERING

00:09:28.892 --> 00:09:32.795
AND ALLOWING
THE ORICHALCOS TO
TAKE ME WHERE THEY ARE.

00:09:32.795 --> 00:09:35.365
DON'T YOU WANT TO BE
BY THEIR SIDE?

00:09:35.365 --> 00:09:38.234
YOUR FRIENDS ARE
COMPLETELY LOST
WITHOUT YOU.

00:09:38.234 --> 00:09:40.036
DON'T TURN AWAY.

00:09:40.036 --> 00:09:44.474
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS PLACE YOUR HAND OVER
YOUR DUEL DISK AND SUBMIT.

00:09:44.474 --> 00:09:47.310
DECLARE DEFEAT,
AND YOU'LL BE FREE--

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:49.979
FREE TO SEE YOUR FRIENDS
ONE LAST TIME

00:09:49.979 --> 00:09:51.814
BEFORE THE RISE
OF THE BEAST.

00:09:51.814 --> 00:09:55.552
IT'S ABOUT TIME YOU ACCEPTED
YOUR TRUE DESTINY.

00:09:55.552 --> 00:10:00.924
YOU'VE RETURNED TO EARTH
TO PAY FOR THE WRONGS
YOU ONCE COMMITTED!!

00:10:00.924 --> 00:10:02.492
YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE.

00:10:02.492 --> 00:10:05.328
YOU NEARLY DESTROYED
THE WORLD.

00:10:05.328 --> 00:10:08.765
SO IN ORDER TO COMPENSATE FOR
THE MISDEEDS OF YOUR PAST...

00:10:08.765 --> 00:10:12.835
YOU MUST JOIN ME IN
USHERING IN THE AGE
OF THE FUTURE!

00:10:12.835 --> 00:10:17.407
SURRENDER YOUR SPIRIT
SO THAT I MAY REBUILD
PARADISE!

00:10:17.407 --> 00:10:18.975
JUST GIVE UP.

00:10:18.975 --> 00:10:22.912
I MUST SURRENDER
MY SOUL. IT'S MY FATE.

00:10:22.912 --> 00:10:24.480
YES, PHARAOH.

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:28.218
KEEP LISTENING TO THE VOICE
OF REASON INSIDE YOUR HEAD.

00:10:28.218 --> 00:10:30.687
I MUST...GIVE UP.

00:10:30.687 --> 00:10:32.822
YOU'RE ALMOST THERE.

00:10:32.822 --> 00:10:36.326
GIVE IN
AND JOIN YOUR FRIENDS.

00:10:36.326 --> 00:10:37.994
IT CONVERTS
EVERY ONE

00:10:37.994 --> 00:10:39.629
OF MY DRAGON'S

00:10:39.629 --> 00:10:43.032
INTO YOUR LIFE

00:10:43.032 --> 00:10:44.467
Yugi: I'M GOING!

00:10:44.467 --> 00:10:45.802
ARE YOU SURE?
YES.

00:10:45.802 --> 00:10:48.571
THEN I'LL BE RIGHT THERE
BY YOUR SIDE, PAL!

00:10:48.571 --> 00:10:51.074
SO LET'S GO DO THIS!

00:10:51.074 --> 00:10:53.142
IT ONLY NEEDS ONE OF US,

00:10:53.142 --> 00:10:55.678
SO I'M LETTING THE SEAL
TAKE ME INSTEAD.

00:10:55.678 --> 00:10:58.548
NOOOO! YUGI!!

FAREWELL.

ENCIRCLE THE PHARAOH!

HA HA HA HA!

00:11:22.505 --> 00:11:24.307
JUST RELAX.

00:11:24.307 --> 00:11:26.909
LET THE DARKNESS
CONSUME YOU.

00:11:26.909 --> 00:11:30.647
REACH DEEP WITHIN YOUR CORE,
AND SET YOUR SPIRIT FREE.

LOST THE DUEL!

WHY DIDN'T THE SEAL
TAKE YOUR SOUL!?

TELL ME!

YOU FORCED ME TO GAZE
INSIDE MY HEART,

THINKING I WOULD FIND
ONLY DARKNESS.

BUT YOU WERE WRONG.

00:12:24.711 --> 00:12:27.414
THEN YOU GAZED
IN THE WRONG PLACE!

LOOK,
BELIEVE WHAT YOU WISH,

BUT I KNOW THE TRUTH.

00:12:31.618 --> 00:12:34.121
MY HEART IS FILLED WITH
THE LIGHT OF FRIENDSHIP,

00:12:34.121 --> 00:12:36.123
AND NO MAGIC
CAN TAKE THAT AWAY,

NO MATTER
HOW STRONG IT IS.

SO THANK YOU.

YOU REMINDED ME
THAT MY FRIENDS

FROM THE FIELD!

OF YOU CENTURIES AGO!

WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!?
MY PRECIOUS SEAL IS GONE!

YOUR RING OF DARKNESS
IS USELESS IN OUR PRESENCE!

00:14:51.758 --> 00:14:54.161
DID YOU FORGET
OUR LAST ENCOUNTER?

00:14:54.161 --> 00:14:56.230
I CERTAINLY DID NOT.

I SHALL END MY TURN.

00:16:44.404 --> 00:16:47.207
MY DIVINE SERPENT WAS BORN!

00:16:47.207 --> 00:16:49.910
OF COURSE,
THERE'S A PRICE TO PAY.

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:54.281
FIRST, I MUST SEND
EVERY CARD IN MY HAND
TO THE GRAVEYARD.

00:16:54.281 --> 00:16:57.984
AFTER THAT, I'M REQUIRED
TO GIVE UP EVERY ONE

HOWEVER, AS LONG AS

00:17:08.562 --> 00:17:10.630
I REMAIN IN THE GAME.

[GASP] HIS STRENGTH!
IT'S INFINITE!

00:17:16.436 --> 00:17:20.841
WHICH MEANS THERE'S NOT
A MONSTER IN YOUR DECK
THAT CAN STAND UP TO IT.

00:17:20.841 --> 00:17:24.478
AND ONCE IT STRIKES
YOUR KNIGHT...
YOUR SOUL IS MINE.

00:17:32.189 --> 00:17:34.525
Dartz: STARING AT
YOUR DECK WON'T HELP.

00:17:34.525 --> 00:17:36.460
YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY
PLAY SOMETHING.

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:40.531

ON MY WORD.

00:18:03.187 --> 00:18:05.523
VERY WELL. FIRST...

00:18:05.523 --> 00:18:08.192
I DISCARD 10 CARDS
FROM MY DECK

00:18:08.192 --> 00:18:11.529
SO MY NEW MONSTER
CAN ATTACK.

00:18:11.529 --> 00:18:13.430
DIVINE SERPENT, GO!

00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:19.003

THERE WERE TWO.

BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY...

00:18:34.185 --> 00:18:36.587
YOU JUST LOST THE REST
OF YOUR LIFE POINTS,

00:18:36.587 --> 00:18:38.822
SO THE DUEL IS OVER!

00:18:38.822 --> 00:18:41.225

YOU TOLD ME TO PLAY
A CARD, SO I DID.

00:18:59.143 --> 00:19:02.179
IT'S A POWERFUL TRAP
KNOWN AS RELAY SOUL.

00:19:02.179 --> 00:19:04.014
WHEN MY LIFE POINTS
HIT ZERO,

00:19:04.014 --> 00:19:05.649
IT ALLOWED ME
TO STAY IN THE GAME

00:19:05.649 --> 00:19:07.518
BY SUMMONING MY
DARK MAGICIAN GIRL

00:19:07.518 --> 00:19:10.354
AND PUTTING MY FATE
IN HER HANDS.

00:19:10.354 --> 00:19:11.622
HMM.

00:19:11.622 --> 00:19:14.692
SO YOU AND I
ARE IN THE SAME
SITUATION NOW.

00:19:14.692 --> 00:19:16.994
EACH OF US
HAS ONE MONSTER.

00:19:16.994 --> 00:19:19.196
YOU HAVE
YOUR SERPENT,

00:19:19.196 --> 00:19:21.665
AND I HAVE
DARK MAGICIAN GIRL.

00:19:21.665 --> 00:19:25.703
WHEN ONE IS DESTROYED,
THE CARDHOLDER WILL LOSE.

00:19:28.339 --> 00:19:30.040
ALL RIGHT!

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:32.109
LET THE FINAL PHASE
BEGIN!

00:19:32.109 --> 00:19:34.645
YES. BUT UNDERSTAND THIS.

00:19:34.645 --> 00:19:38.015
YOU MAY HAVE ALTERED
THE RULES OF OUR BATTLE,

00:19:38.015 --> 00:19:41.986
BUT YOUR CHANCES OF VICTORY
ARE JUST AS SLIM!

00:19:41.986 --> 00:19:45.923
I HAVE THE SPIRITS
OF MY FRIENDS TO
SUPPORT ME, DARTZ!

00:19:45.923 --> 00:19:49.660
BUT YOU,
ON THE OTHER HAND,
ARE COMPLETELY ALONE!

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:52.663
I POSSESS MORE POWER
THAN YOU OR YOUR FRIENDS!

00:19:52.663 --> 00:19:55.065
AND I'LL PROVE IT
BY PLAYING THIS!

00:19:55.065 --> 00:19:57.668
IMPACT REVIVE!!

00:19:57.668 --> 00:20:01.038
IT BRINGS BACK A MONSTER
THAT WAS DESTROYED THIS TURN

00:20:01.038 --> 00:20:04.008
AND GIVES IT AN EXTRA
500 ATTACK POINTS.

00:20:07.745 --> 00:20:10.547
[PANTING]

00:20:10.547 --> 00:20:13.784
THAT'S MY CARD!
WHY DID YOU
REVIVE TIMAEUS?

00:20:13.784 --> 00:20:16.654
I THOUGHT IT WOULD
BE FUN TO PROVE

00:20:16.654 --> 00:20:19.223
HOW POWERLESS
YOU TRULY ARE.

00:20:19.223 --> 00:20:21.592
OH, AND ONE MORE THING.

00:20:21.592 --> 00:20:25.462
IMPACT REVIVE ALSO LETS
MY MONSTER ATTACK
ONE MORE TIME.

00:20:25.462 --> 00:20:26.830
OH, NO!

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:30.200
I SEND 10 CARDS
FROM MY DECK
TO MY GRAVEYARD.

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:32.469
NOW, DIVINE SERPENT...

00:20:32.469 --> 00:20:34.271
END THIS DUEL!

00:20:42.946 --> 00:20:44.982
Thinking:
HIS SOUL IS MINE.

00:20:44.982 --> 00:20:47.184
Thinking:
IF SHE'S DESTROYED,

00:20:47.184 --> 00:20:48.819
ALL HOPE IS LOST!
