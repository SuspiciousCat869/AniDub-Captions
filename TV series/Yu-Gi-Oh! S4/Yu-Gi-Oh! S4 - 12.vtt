00:10:16.754 --> 00:10:18.890
WHAT A SAD WAY
TO SEE THE WORLD.

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:20.995
YEAH, WELL, LIFE IS SAD,

00:10:20.995 --> 00:10:22.597
AND THE SOONER
YOU REALIZE THAT,

00:10:22.597 --> 00:10:24.233
THE BETTER OFF YOU'LL BE.

00:10:24.233 --> 00:10:25.502
I OUGHTTA KNOW.

00:10:25.502 --> 00:10:28.908
I USED TO HAVE EVERYTHING
A KID COULD EVER WANT,

00:10:28.908 --> 00:10:33.216
UNTIL ONE DAY,
WHEN EVERYTHING
WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM ME.

00:10:33.216 --> 00:10:34.919
Man: DO YOU RECOMMEND
THE ESCARGOT?

00:10:34.919 --> 00:10:37.724
Second man: SO TELL ME
ALL ABOUT YOUR WEEK
IN THE FRENCH RIVIERA.

00:10:37.724 --> 00:10:39.928
Third man:
THE CAVIAR IS SUPERB
TONIGHT, ISN'T IT?

00:10:39.928 --> 00:10:41.264
Fourth man: GARCON,
MORE WATER PLEASE.

00:10:41.264 --> 00:10:42.900
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, RAF!

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:44.202
A PRESENT?

00:10:44.202 --> 00:10:45.204

00:10:52.785 --> 00:10:55.189
IT'S PERFECT.
THANKS!

00:10:55.189 --> 00:10:58.227
WE ONLY HAD
TO GO TO 18 STORES
BEFORE WE FOUND IT.

00:10:58.227 --> 00:11:02.034
THAT'S IT?

00:11:02.034 --> 00:11:04.539
DON'T FORGET TO MAKE
YOUR BIRTHDAY WISH, RAFAEL.

00:11:04.539 --> 00:11:05.541
WHAT'S IT GONNA BE?

00:11:05.541 --> 00:11:07.043

THE STORM WAS OVER

00:11:59.002 --> 00:12:01.072
JUST AS QUICKLY
AS IT STARTED.

00:12:01.072 --> 00:12:03.343
MY FAMILY MADE IT
ON TO A RESCUE BOAT,

00:12:03.343 --> 00:12:10.689
BUT I WAS LEFT BEHIND.

00:12:10.689 --> 00:12:12.660

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:14.696

00:12:19.405 --> 00:12:22.911
I THOUGHT MY MIND
WAS PLAYING TRICKS ON ME,

00:12:22.911 --> 00:12:25.683
BUT SURELY SOMEONE ELSE
WAS ON THIS ISLAND--

00:12:25.683 --> 00:12:30.190
MAYBE EVEN MY FAMILY.

00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:36.803
Young Rafael: MOM! DAD!

00:12:36.803 --> 00:12:41.277

IT DIDN'T TAKE LONG FOR
ME TO REALIZE THAT I WAS ALONE.

00:12:41.277 --> 00:12:44.650
EVERYTHING
I ONCE HAD WAS GONE.

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:45.919
NOOOO!

00:12:45.919 --> 00:12:55.202
Rafael, voice-over:
WHO WOULD WATCH OVER ME NOW?

00:12:55.202 --> 00:12:58.040
ALL I HAD WERE
THE CLOTHES ON MY BACK

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:06.087
AND MY DUEL MONSTERS CARDS.

00:13:06.087 --> 00:13:08.091
I KNEW I HAD TWO CHOICES:

00:13:08.091 --> 00:13:10.729
SIT AROUND AND FEEL
SORRY FOR MYSELF

00:13:10.729 --> 00:13:12.732
OR TOUGHEN UP AND MOVE ON.

00:13:12.732 --> 00:13:16.740
AND IF I WANTED TO SURVIVE,
THE DECISION WAS SIMPLE.

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:20.814
THERE WAS NO TIME FOR WEAKNESS.

00:13:20.814 --> 00:13:24.721
I LEARNED AT A YOUNG AGE
THAT THE WORLD
IS COLD AND LONELY.

00:13:24.721 --> 00:13:26.791
I LOST MY CHILDHOOD,

00:13:26.791 --> 00:13:29.195
BUT I GAINED SOMETHING
MORE IMPORTANT:

00:13:29.195 --> 00:13:31.967
THE TRUTH...

00:13:31.967 --> 00:13:36.175
AND AN UNDYING TRUST
FOR THE ONLY FAMILY I HAD,

00:13:36.175 --> 00:13:39.246
MY 3 GUARDIAN CARDS.

00:13:39.246 --> 00:13:44.422
THESE DUEL MONSTERS
WERE EVERYTHING TO ME.

00:13:44.422 --> 00:13:46.092

AND SANE.

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:02.287
THEY SAVED ME
FROM LOSING MY MIND,

00:14:02.287 --> 00:14:07.764
AND I OWED IT TO THOSE CARDS
TO SAVE THEM.

00:14:07.764 --> 00:14:10.001
WE SHARED A POWERFUL BOND.

00:14:17.381 --> 00:14:22.490
GUARDIAN EATOS, GUARDIAN GRARL,
AND GUARDIAN KEY'EST,

00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:26.364
THESE MONSTERS SAW ME
THROUGH THE HARDEST
YEARS OF MY LIFE,

00:14:26.364 --> 00:14:29.069
AND THEY CONTINUE
TO PROTECT ME.

00:14:32.608 --> 00:14:35.513
RAFAEL, IF YOU TRULY
RESPECT YOUR CARDS,

00:14:35.513 --> 00:14:37.651
THEN WHY DO YOU USE
THEM FOR EVIL?

00:14:37.651 --> 00:14:39.287
EVIL, PHARAOH?

00:14:39.287 --> 00:14:41.090
WHAT YOU CONSIDER EVIL

00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:44.262
I LOOK AT
AS SAVING THE PLANET
FROM FALLING APART

00:14:44.262 --> 00:14:47.401
AT THE HANDS
OF PEOPLE LIKE YOU
AND YOUR LITTLE FRIENDS.

00:14:47.401 --> 00:14:51.575
IT'S MY DESTINY.

00:14:51.575 --> 00:14:53.879
I ALWAYS WONDERED, "WHY ME?"

00:14:53.879 --> 00:14:58.988
AND AFTER SPENDING
3 LONG YEARS ON THAT ISLAND,
I FINALLY GOT MY ANSWER.

00:15:04.732 --> 00:15:06.368
HOW COULD I HAVE MISSED IT?

00:15:06.368 --> 00:15:09.473
THERE WAS AN ENTIRE CITY
RIGHT OFF THE COAST.

00:15:09.473 --> 00:15:11.144
I WAS SAVED.

00:15:20.627 --> 00:15:22.363

00:15:22.363 --> 00:15:24.100
NOT AGAIN!

AAH!

00:15:42.165 --> 00:15:43.166
HELLO?

00:15:43.166 --> 00:15:45.604

FOR WE SHALL MEET AGAIN.

I WOKE UP ON A RESCUE BOAT.

I MADE THE COVER
OF NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES
AROUND THE WORLD--

"MIRACLE BOY REJOINS

STRANDED FOR YEARS."

PLEASE.

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:23.739
THE WORLD I CAME BACK TO
WAS ANYTHING BUT CIVILIZED.

00:16:23.739 --> 00:16:26.477
THAT ISLAND
MAY HAVE BEEN LONELY,

00:16:26.477 --> 00:16:29.816
BUT AT LEAST
IT WAS A PEACEFUL
PLACE TO LIVE.

00:16:29.816 --> 00:16:32.354
AND UNLIKE
THE OUTSIDE WORLD,
PHARAOH,

00:16:32.354 --> 00:16:35.893
THERE WAS NO ONE
ON THAT DESERTED ISLAND
WHO COULD WALK OUT ON ME

00:16:35.893 --> 00:16:38.632
LIKE MY FAMILY DID.

00:16:38.632 --> 00:16:41.170
BUT I HAVE
A NEW FAMILY NOW.

HOW CAN YOU BLAME

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:49.249
FOR WHAT
HAPPENED TO YOU?

00:16:49.249 --> 00:16:52.989
I TOLD YOU,
PEOPLE ARE EVIL!

00:16:52.989 --> 00:16:55.026
BUT IT WASN'T ALWAYS
THAT WAY.

00:16:55.026 --> 00:16:57.730
ONCE,
THE WORLD WAS PERFECT,

00:16:57.730 --> 00:17:00.536
AND WHEN I GOT BACK
FROM THAT DESERT ISLAND,

00:17:00.536 --> 00:17:04.577
I SAW THIS ANCIENT PARADISE
WITH MY OWN EYES.

WE'D MEET AGAIN, RAFAEL.

00:17:11.121 --> 00:17:17.466

YOUR OLD LIFE BEHIND?

CAN COME OF YOUR PLAN.

DON'T WORRY, PHARAOH,

00:17:35.965 --> 00:17:39.004
YOU WON'T BE AROUND
TO SEE HOW MY PLAN TURNS OUT.

GO, RESCUER FROM THE GRAVE!

WELL, FUN FOR ME.

00:19:11.368 --> 00:19:15.442
IT INSTANTLY STOPS
YOUR MONSTER'S ATTACK.

THAT MUST BE
WHY HE TOSSED OUT

BY SEALING AWAY
YOUR VERY SOUL.

00:19:27.297 --> 00:19:30.202
AFTER ALL,
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
TO SUPPLY THE GREAT BEAST

00:19:30.202 --> 00:19:32.906
WITH ENOUGH ENERGY
TO WIPE OUT MANKIND.

00:19:32.906 --> 00:19:35.644
BUT WHY STAND HERE
AND TALK ABOUT IT?

00:19:35.644 --> 00:19:38.049
THE SOONER I WIN THIS DUEL,

00:19:38.049 --> 00:19:40.487
THE SOONER
YOU'LL BE GONE FOREVER.

00:19:40.487 --> 00:19:44.160
AND WITH THAT,
I'LL PLACE
TWO CARDS FACEDOWN.

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:48.200
THEN I'LL PLAY THE MAGIC CARD
PURITY OF THE CEMETERY!

YOU LOSE 100
OF YOUR LIFE POINTS
EACH TURN

00:19:57.985 --> 00:20:01.423
FOR EVERY MONSTER
THAT REMAINS
IN YOUR CARD GRAVEYARD,

00:20:01.423 --> 00:20:04.128
AND AS LONG AS MY GRAVEYARD
IS MONSTER-FREE,

00:20:04.128 --> 00:20:05.732
MY CARD STAYS IN PLAY.

00:20:05.732 --> 00:20:08.002
Yugi, voice-over:
I HAFTA SEND A MONSTER
OF HIS TO THE GRAVEYARD

00:20:08.002 --> 00:20:09.672
OR I'M A GONER.

00:20:09.672 --> 00:20:11.375
NOW I HAVE
ONE MORE THING

00:20:11.375 --> 00:20:13.044
YOU MAY BE
INTERESTED TO KNOW.

00:20:13.044 --> 00:20:15.248
I HAVE NO INTENTION
OF PLAYING

00:20:15.248 --> 00:20:18.788
MY SEAL OF ORICHALCOS
MAGIC CARD,

00:20:18.788 --> 00:20:20.858
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU'RE SAFE.

00:20:20.858 --> 00:20:22.762
NOT BY A LONG SHOT.

00:20:22.762 --> 00:20:24.264
YOUR FATE
IS STILL SEALED,

00:20:24.264 --> 00:20:26.100
AND WHEN YOU LOSE
YOUR SOUL,

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:29.774
IT'LL BE BY
YOUR OWN DOING.

00:20:29.774 --> 00:20:33.280
MY MONSTER
HAS 3000 ATTACK POINTS.

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:35.781
YOUR MULTICOLORED
POM POM SISTERS

00:20:35.781 --> 00:20:39.184
DON'T EVEN COME CLOSE
TO THE POWER OF MY GUARDIAN.

00:20:39.184 --> 00:20:42.020
NOW ATTACK
WITH GRAVITY AXE!

00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:47.292
