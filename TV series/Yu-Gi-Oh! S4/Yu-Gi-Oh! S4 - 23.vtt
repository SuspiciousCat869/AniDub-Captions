00:10:01.514 --> 00:10:02.916
IT MAY COME TRUE.

00:10:02.916 --> 00:10:05.588
FINE,
USE YOUR MAGIC CARD.

00:10:05.588 --> 00:10:08.193
IT WON'T WORK
ON MY ZIGGURAT ANYWAY.

00:10:08.193 --> 00:10:12.200
THAT'S WHY I'M USING IT
ON YOUR TWO LITTLE DOLLIES.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:16.208
NOW I CAN CALL
MY ULTIMATE MONSTER
TO THE FIELD--

00:10:16.208 --> 00:10:19.313
MY BLUE-EYES WHITE DRAGON!

00:10:32.272 --> 00:10:36.145
IT LOOKS LIKE
WE'RE EVEN NOW.

00:10:36.145 --> 00:10:38.149
LOOKS CAN BE DECEIVING.

00:10:38.149 --> 00:10:40.520
YOU TALK A GOOD GAME,
BUT DEEP DOWN

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:43.893
I KNOW YOU REALIZE
THERE'S NO WAY
YOU CAN WIN.

00:10:43.893 --> 00:10:45.629
THINK ABOUT IT.

00:10:45.629 --> 00:10:47.967
OUR MONSTERS ARE EQUAL
IN ATTACK STRENGTH,

00:10:47.967 --> 00:10:49.537
ONLY MINE
CAN'T BE DESTROYED.

00:10:49.537 --> 00:10:51.474
JUST GO.

00:10:51.474 --> 00:10:56.082
FINE!

00:10:56.082 --> 00:10:58.253
I'LL PLACE
A CARD FACE DOWN,

00:10:58.253 --> 00:11:00.891
AND SINCE MY TURN'S DONE
I GET ONE OF THESE--

00:11:00.891 --> 00:11:03.830
ANOTHER ROBOT TOKEN.

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:06.335
HE GETS ONE OF THOSE
EVERY TURN.

00:11:06.335 --> 00:11:09.774
THAT MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE
TO ATTACK HIS ZIGGURAT.

00:11:09.774 --> 00:11:12.312
IT'S TIME TO SAY GOOD-BYE
TO YOUR ROBOT.

00:11:12.312 --> 00:11:16.153
BLUE-EYES,
SEND HIS TIN CAN BACK
TO THE TRASH HEAP

00:11:16.153 --> 00:11:18.758
WITH YOUR WHITE LIGHTNING
ATTACK.

00:11:25.404 --> 00:11:27.608
I PUT THIS FACE DOWN.

00:11:27.608 --> 00:11:28.911
THAT'S ALL.

00:11:28.911 --> 00:11:31.348
THAT WAS YOUR
LAST CHANCE.

00:11:31.348 --> 00:11:34.186
AND NOW IT'S TIME
TO END THIS DUEL

00:11:34.186 --> 00:11:37.994
AND COMPLETE
MY BROTHER'S VENGEANCE.

00:11:37.994 --> 00:11:40.866
Alister, voice-over:
MIKEY, THIS IS FOR YOU.

00:11:40.866 --> 00:11:45.408
AND NOW I ACTIVATE
TOY ROBOT BOX.

00:11:45.408 --> 00:11:48.847
ALL I HAFTA DO
IS DISCARD 3 CARDS
FROM MY HAND,

00:11:48.847 --> 00:11:53.389
WHICH ALLOWS ME
TO SUMMON 3 MORE ROBOTS.

00:11:53.389 --> 00:11:56.261
NEXT, I'LL SACRIFICE 1.

00:11:56.261 --> 00:11:59.400
THIS LETS ME PLAY
MY SPELL CANCELLER.

00:12:03.875 --> 00:12:08.084
THIS MONSTER
PREVENTS YOU FROM USING
ANY OF YOUR MAGIC CARDS,

00:12:08.084 --> 00:12:10.588
AND IT'S MY TICKET
TO VICTORY.

00:12:16.096 --> 00:12:17.765
Alister:
SOON EVERYONE LIKE YOU

00:12:17.765 --> 00:12:19.669
WILL BE ERASED
FROM THIS WORLD.

00:12:19.669 --> 00:12:21.806
BUT I THOUGHT
YOU HATED VIOLENCE?

00:12:21.806 --> 00:12:23.343
I DO.

00:12:23.343 --> 00:12:26.147
THAT'S A LIE!

00:12:26.147 --> 00:12:29.387
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU
AND YOUR ARMY OF REJECTS

00:12:29.387 --> 00:12:30.956
PLAN TO DESTROY EVERY PERSON

00:12:30.956 --> 00:12:34.363
WHO DOESN'T SHARE
THE SAME LAME IDEAS YOU DO.

00:12:34.363 --> 00:12:35.565
YOU'RE WRONG.

00:12:35.565 --> 00:12:37.535
WE'RE SAVING EARTH,

00:12:37.535 --> 00:12:39.973
'CAUSE IF PEOPLE
LIKE YOU CONTINUE
TO EXIST,

00:12:39.973 --> 00:12:41.810
THE WHOLE WORLD'LL
CRUMBLE.

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:44.315
HOW NICE OF YOU.

00:12:44.315 --> 00:12:46.986
BUT WHAT IF YOUR BROTHER
WAS STILL BY YOUR SIDE?

00:12:46.986 --> 00:12:48.222
WHAT'S THAT?

00:12:48.222 --> 00:12:50.459
WOULD YOU STILL TRY
TO WIPE OUT MANKIND

00:12:50.459 --> 00:12:52.297
IF THAT MEANT HURTING HIM?

00:12:52.297 --> 00:12:54.234
HOW DARE YOU?

00:12:54.234 --> 00:12:56.270
IT'S YOUR FAULT
THAT HE'S GONE.

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:57.707
NICE TRY,

00:12:57.707 --> 00:13:00.745
BUT DON'T YOU THINK IT'S TIME
YOU ACCEPTED THE TRUTH?

00:13:00.745 --> 00:13:02.649
WHAT TRUTH?

00:13:02.649 --> 00:13:03.985
YOU BETTER
EXPLAIN YOURSELF.

00:13:03.985 --> 00:13:06.656
AS A BROTHER,
IT WAS YOUR DUTY

00:13:06.656 --> 00:13:09.562
TO PROTECT HIM AT ALL COSTS,
AND YOU FAILED, ALISTER.

00:13:09.562 --> 00:13:12.835
YOUR LITTLE BROTHER
WAS CAPTURED
BECAUSE OF YOU.

00:13:12.835 --> 00:13:15.139
STOP TRYING TO BLAME
EVERYONE ELSE.

00:13:15.139 --> 00:13:17.410
THAT'S IT.

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:19.748
YOU'RE GOING DOWN.

00:13:19.748 --> 00:13:24.156
ZIGGURAT,
ATTACK HIM NOW WITH
YOUR SKY CANNON BLAST.

00:13:24.156 --> 00:13:26.627
YOUR BLUE-EYES
IS HISTORY.

00:13:32.037 --> 00:13:33.674
SETO, NO!

00:13:33.674 --> 00:13:37.047
UNLIKE YOU,
I PLAN TO SAVE MY BROTHER

00:13:37.047 --> 00:13:39.518
BY WINING THIS BATTLE
NO MATTER WHAT.

00:13:39.518 --> 00:13:42.356
SO WHY DON'T YOU
WATCH AND LEARN?

00:13:42.356 --> 00:13:44.360
YOU WERE SO BUSY
RANTING AND RAVING

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:46.531
YOU FAILED TO NOTICE
MY TRAP CARD.

00:13:46.531 --> 00:13:47.700
OH, NO.

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:52.709
I ACTIVATE TYRANT WING.

00:13:52.709 --> 00:13:54.813
BY ADDING THIS CARD
TO MY BLUE-EYES,

00:13:54.813 --> 00:13:57.685
I'VE GIVEN HIM AN EXTRA
400 ATTACK POINTS.

00:13:57.685 --> 00:14:00.524
AND IN CASE
YOU'RE IN TOO MUCH SHOCK
TO DO THE MATH,

00:14:00.524 --> 00:14:04.598
THAT MEANS NOW MY DRAGON
IS STRONG ENOUGH
TO DESTROY YOUR ZIGGURAT.

00:14:04.598 --> 00:14:06.068
YOU CAN'T.

00:14:06.068 --> 00:14:09.140
I WON'T LET YOU ENDANGER
MY BROTHER'S LIFE.

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:11.578
BLUE-EYES, END THIS NOW!

00:14:35.556 --> 00:14:39.430
YOUR FLOATING TRASH HEAP
IS GONE.

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:41.868
BUT THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

00:14:41.868 --> 00:14:45.474
COULDA FOOLED ME.

00:14:45.474 --> 00:14:49.749
AS SOON AS I CRUSH
YOUR PUNY DEFENSE,
YOU'LL HAVE NO MONSTERS.

00:14:49.749 --> 00:14:51.753
WHO NEEDS MONSTERS?

00:14:51.753 --> 00:14:55.693
I'VE GOT THE POWER
OF THE ORICHALCOS
ON MY SIDE,

00:14:55.693 --> 00:14:57.531
AND ONCE
IT DESTROYS THIS PLANE,

00:14:57.531 --> 00:15:01.237
THE SEAL OF ORICHALCOS
WILL ABSORB ALL 3 OF US.

00:15:06.313 --> 00:15:08.350
YOU KNOW
YOU CAN'T WIN THE GAME

00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:10.588
SO YOU'RE JUST GIVING UP?

00:15:10.588 --> 00:15:13.460
YOU'RE THE BIGGEST COWARD
I'VE EVER MET IN MY LIFE!

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:14.930
YOU'RE WRONG.

00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:17.367
I'M DOING ALL THIS
TO SAVE HUMANITY.

00:15:17.367 --> 00:15:19.271
COME ON,
YOU'RE DOING THIS

00:15:19.271 --> 00:15:21.374
'CAUSE YOU'RE TOO SCARED
TO FACE THE TRUTH.

00:15:21.374 --> 00:15:23.612
ALISTER, STOP!

00:15:23.612 --> 00:15:25.082
WHAT WOULD
YOUR LITTLE BROTHER THINK

00:15:25.082 --> 00:15:27.320
IF HE SAW YOU
ACTING LIKE THIS?

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:33.764
LOOK, IT'S DYNA-DUDE,

00:15:33.764 --> 00:15:35.568
AND SOON HE'LL SAVE US.

00:15:35.568 --> 00:15:40.410
MIKEY,
I WANT YOU TO HAVE
THIS PICTURE OF MOM.

00:15:42.348 --> 00:15:47.490
YOU'RE JUST MAD AT YOURSELF
'CAUSE YOU LET HIM DOWN.

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:48.525
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE

00:15:48.525 --> 00:15:50.563
YOU LET YOUR
BROTHER DOWN, TOO,

00:15:50.563 --> 00:15:52.500
'CAUSE YOU CAN'T
SAVE HIM,

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:53.902
EVEN IF WE DO CONTINUE.

00:15:53.902 --> 00:15:55.338
TRY ME.

00:15:55.338 --> 00:15:56.807
BUT, SETO--

00:15:56.807 --> 00:15:58.444
YOU'RE NUTS!

00:15:58.444 --> 00:16:01.516
I HAVE 3 MONSTERS
UP AGAINST
YOUR 1 DRAGON.

00:16:01.516 --> 00:16:04.489
YOU COULD NEVER
DEFEAT ME BEFORE
THIS PLANE GOES DOWN,

00:16:04.489 --> 00:16:06.826
EVEN IF I WERE TO END
MY TURN RIGHT NOW.

00:16:06.826 --> 00:16:08.764
WHATTAYA WAITING FOR?

00:16:08.764 --> 00:16:10.833
LET'S DUEL.

00:16:10.833 --> 00:16:13.506
ALL I NEED
IS ONE MORE TURN.

00:16:13.506 --> 00:16:16.779
GIMME THAT,
AND I'LL TAKE YOU DOWN
AND SAVE MOKUBA.

00:16:16.779 --> 00:16:20.652
ALL RIGHT,
IF YOU'RE SO CONFIDENT,

00:16:20.652 --> 00:16:22.656
THEN GO AHEAD
AND TRY TO STOP ME.

00:16:22.656 --> 00:16:24.492
THIS DUEL IS STILL ON,
KAIBA,

00:16:24.492 --> 00:16:26.763
AND I END MY TURN.

00:16:26.763 --> 00:16:28.967
BIG MISTAKE, ALISTER,

00:16:28.967 --> 00:16:31.105
BUT YOU'LL SEE THAT
FOR YOURSELF

00:16:31.105 --> 00:16:33.209
AS SOON AS I DRAW MY CARD.

00:16:33.209 --> 00:16:35.146
THIS IS IT--

00:16:35.146 --> 00:16:37.584
MY LAST SHOT AT VICTORY.

00:16:37.584 --> 00:16:39.855
COME ON...

00:16:39.855 --> 00:16:42.526
IT ALL ENDS HERE--
WITH THIS!

00:16:49.037 --> 00:16:53.445
NOW I PLAY
THE FANG OF CRITIAS.

00:16:58.588 --> 00:17:02.762
THEN I FUSE IT TOGETHER
WITH MY TYRANT WING TRAP CARD

00:17:02.762 --> 00:17:06.937
TO FORM TYRANT BURST DRAGON!

00:17:06.937 --> 00:17:08.741
BUT IT DOESN'T END THERE.

00:17:08.741 --> 00:17:12.114
NEXT, I'LL COMBINE
MY NEW DRAGON
WITH MY BLUE-EYES

00:17:12.114 --> 00:17:15.185
TO FORM BLUE-EYES
TYRANT DRAGON.

00:17:25.238 --> 00:17:29.546
NOW MY BLUE-EYES,
DESTROY ALL 3
OF HIS MONSTERS!

00:17:44.239 --> 00:17:46.077
IT WORKED.

00:17:46.077 --> 00:17:52.054
YOU WIN.

00:17:52.054 --> 00:17:53.625
Mokuba: OH, NO.

00:17:53.625 --> 00:17:56.096
THAT THING'S GONNA
TAKE HIS SOUL, SETO.

00:17:56.096 --> 00:17:59.469
WE HAFTA DO
SOMETHING QUICK.

00:17:59.469 --> 00:18:01.906
Alister:
MIKEY, IS THAT YOU?

00:18:06.782 --> 00:18:09.153
IT'S ABOUT TIME
I GAVE THIS
BACK TO YOU, BRO.

00:18:09.153 --> 00:18:11.491
THANKS, ALISTER.

00:18:11.491 --> 00:18:14.897
NO SWEAT.

00:18:14.897 --> 00:18:16.934
Mokuba:
ALISTER, NO!

00:18:22.412 --> 00:18:25.383
HE'S GONE.

00:18:25.383 --> 00:18:27.754
I GUESS THE SEAL
CAPTURED HIM.

00:18:27.754 --> 00:18:30.059
[RUMBLING]

00:18:30.059 --> 00:18:31.662
MOKUBA,
WAIT HERE FOR ME.

00:18:31.662 --> 00:18:32.931
SETO!

00:18:38.942 --> 00:18:40.411
I'LL SAVE HIM.

00:18:40.411 --> 00:18:43.084
I WON'T LET
MY BROTHER GET HURT
NO MATTER WHAT.

00:18:43.084 --> 00:18:45.521
DO YOU HEAR ME, ALISTER?

00:18:45.521 --> 00:18:49.795
THIS PLANE WON'T CRASH.

00:18:49.795 --> 00:18:52.835
WHAT'S THIS?

00:18:52.835 --> 00:18:54.839
WHAT? NOT AGAIN.

00:19:00.416 --> 00:19:02.754
TEA, LOOK.

00:19:02.754 --> 00:19:04.656
Joey: WHOA.

00:19:24.059 --> 00:19:25.963
Tea: CHECK IT OUT.

00:19:25.963 --> 00:19:28.468
THOSE DRAGONS
JUST SAVED THAT AIRPLANE.

00:19:28.468 --> 00:19:30.839
Joey: NOW THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU DON'T SEE EVERYDAY.

00:19:30.839 --> 00:19:32.910
JOEY! TRISTAN!

00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:34.312
IT'S TEA.

00:19:34.312 --> 00:19:37.050
AND YUGI.

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:38.287
WAIT A SEC.

00:19:38.287 --> 00:19:40.356
THAT'S ONE
OF KAIBA'S PLANES.

00:19:40.356 --> 00:19:41.860
Tristan:
HEY, YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:46.669
I HOPE EVERYONE'S OK.

00:19:46.669 --> 00:19:48.104
KAIBA.

00:19:48.104 --> 00:19:51.978
OH, GREAT.

00:19:51.978 --> 00:19:53.982
IF IT ISN'T
THE DWEEB PATROL.

00:19:53.982 --> 00:19:55.485
Tea: WHAT HAPPENED
UP THERE?

00:19:55.485 --> 00:19:57.957
ROLAND!

00:19:57.957 --> 00:20:01.864
Joey: SO YOU DUELED DIS GUY
ON TOP OF A MOVING PLANE?

00:20:01.864 --> 00:20:03.533
MAYBE I DID.

00:20:03.533 --> 00:20:05.905
DON'T YOU GEEKS
HAVE SOMEONE ELSE
TO ANNOY?

00:20:05.905 --> 00:20:07.574
KAIBA,
WE CAN'T DO THIS
WITHOUT YOU

00:20:07.574 --> 00:20:08.977
AND YOU KNOW IT.

00:20:08.977 --> 00:20:11.481
SO PLEASE,
ACCEPT YOUR DESTINY

00:20:11.481 --> 00:20:13.285
AND HELP US
TO STOP THIS EVIL.

00:20:13.285 --> 00:20:16.424
IF I HAD A DIME
FOR EVERY TIME

00:20:16.424 --> 00:20:17.927
YOU USED THE WORD
"DESTINY,"

00:20:17.927 --> 00:20:20.598
I'D BE EVEN RICHER.

00:20:20.598 --> 00:20:22.736
MR. KAIBA!
MOKUBA!

00:20:22.736 --> 00:20:23.738
ARE YOU HURT?

00:20:23.738 --> 00:20:24.806
Mokuba: WE'RE FINE.

00:20:24.806 --> 00:20:28.413
GOOD, BUT I'VE GOT
TERRIBLE NEWS.

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:36.228
Man: MASTER DARTZ,
I'VE JUST RECEIVED WORD

00:20:36.228 --> 00:20:37.497

00:20:37.497 --> 00:20:39.370
Dartz: YES, GO ON.

00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:41.105
THE TAKEOVER WAS A SUCCESS.

00:20:41.105 --> 00:20:43.274
