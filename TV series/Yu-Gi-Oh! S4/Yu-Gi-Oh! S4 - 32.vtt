IN HIS HEART!

00:09:55.755 --> 00:10:00.730
SO PERHAPS IF I DESTROY IT,
I CAN SET RAFAEL FREE!

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:02.601
THE POWER
OF UNDERWORLD CIRCLE

00:10:02.601 --> 00:10:07.543
LETS ME BRING BACK
MY DARK MAGICIAN!

00:10:07.543 --> 00:10:10.014
HE MAY HAVE A SHOT
AFTER ALL.

00:10:10.014 --> 00:10:13.019
YEAH. NOW THAT
HE CAN PLAY CARDS
FROM HIS GRAVEYARD,

00:10:13.019 --> 00:10:15.023
HE SHOULD BE ABLE
TO START KICKING
SOME BUTT!

00:10:15.023 --> 00:10:18.362
I PLACE THIS FACEDOWN...
AND THAT ENDS MY TURN!

00:10:18.362 --> 00:10:20.666
YOU'RE DONE, PHARAOH!

00:10:20.666 --> 00:10:23.572
NOT AS LONG AS
MY MAGIC CARD'S
IN PLAY!

00:10:23.572 --> 00:10:25.475
IT LETS ME
BRING BACK

00:10:25.475 --> 00:10:27.412
MY JACK'S KNIGHT
AS WELL!

00:10:27.412 --> 00:10:29.482
THAT'S AWESOME!

00:10:29.482 --> 00:10:32.353
HE CAN SUMMON MONSTERS
ON HIS OPPONENT'S TURN!

00:10:32.353 --> 00:10:34.291
YOU DON'T SCARE ME!

00:10:34.291 --> 00:10:37.797
YOUR PATHETIC MONSTERS
ARE STILL NO MATCH FOR MINE!

00:10:37.797 --> 00:10:41.604
DREADSCYTHE, ATTACK
HIS DARK MAGICIAN NOW!

00:10:41.604 --> 00:10:45.911
NOT SO FAST, RAFAEL!
ACTIVATE ZERO GRAVITY!

00:10:51.455 --> 00:10:53.658
THANKS TO THE POWER
OF MY TRAP CARD,

00:10:53.658 --> 00:10:55.829
EVERY MONSTER
ON THE FIELD
IN ATTACK MODE

00:10:55.829 --> 00:10:58.334
AUTOMATICALLY
SWITCHES TO
DEFENSE MODE!

00:10:58.334 --> 00:11:01.673
HEY! HE JUST STOPPED
THAT ZOMBIE THING

00:11:01.673 --> 00:11:03.343
DEAD IN ITS TRACKS,
YOU GUYS!

00:11:03.343 --> 00:11:05.747
I DON'T THINK SO!

00:11:05.747 --> 00:11:07.016
NO! WHAT NOW!?

00:11:07.016 --> 00:11:10.956
I ACTIVATE MY TRAP
SPIRIT HUNTING!

00:11:10.956 --> 00:11:15.865
THIS CARD SWITCHES
MY GUARDIAN DREADSCYTHE
BACK INTO ATTACK MODE!

00:11:15.865 --> 00:11:19.238
NOW IT CAN PICK UP
WHERE IT LEFT OFF!

00:11:19.238 --> 00:11:20.941
OH, MAN!

00:11:23.779 --> 00:11:24.881
OH!

00:11:31.824 --> 00:11:33.259
AH! OH, NO!

00:11:33.259 --> 00:11:36.332
RAFAEL DESTROYED TWO
OF HIS MONSTERS AT ONCE!

00:11:36.332 --> 00:11:38.135
IT'S MY MOVE!

00:11:38.135 --> 00:11:42.477
AND MY MAGIC CARD
ALLOWS ME TO BRING BACK
MY DARK MAGICIAN GIRL!

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:48.320
NEXT I'LL ACTIVATE
MY ALTAR OF RESTORATION!

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:50.924
BY DISCARDING TWO CARDS
FROM MY DECK,

00:11:50.924 --> 00:11:54.297
I CAN RESCUE
ANOTHER MONSTER
FROM MY GRAVEYARD!

00:11:54.297 --> 00:11:56.268
AND THE CARD
I CHOOSE IS...

00:11:56.268 --> 00:11:57.737
EYE OF TIMAEUS!

00:12:04.049 --> 00:12:07.220
NOW, TIMAEUS AND
DARK MAGICIAN GIRL...

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:12.163
MERGE TOGETHER!

00:12:12.163 --> 00:12:14.300
Thinking:
HE THINKS HE CAN USE

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:15.869
HIS NEW DRAGON'S
SPECIAL EFFECT

00:12:15.869 --> 00:12:18.942
TO DESTROY MY GUARDIAN.

00:12:18.942 --> 00:12:21.547
ALRIGHT, PHARAOH,
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU GOT!

00:12:21.547 --> 00:12:24.385
NOW, DARK MAGICIAN GIRL
THE DRAGON KNIGHT...

00:12:24.385 --> 00:12:26.254
DESTROY HIS DREADSCYTHE!

00:12:37.241 --> 00:12:40.647
I GUESS THAT'S
THE END OF THAT
FREAK OF NATURE!

00:12:40.647 --> 00:12:44.554
Rafael: HA HA!
YOU DON'T LISTEN
VERY WELL, DO YOU!?

00:12:44.554 --> 00:12:47.526
I TOLD YOU DREADSCYTHE
IS INDESTRUCTIBLE.

00:12:47.526 --> 00:12:50.832
Thinking: HE KNEW THAT MONSTER
COULD REVIVE ITSELF,

00:12:50.832 --> 00:12:52.902
SO WHY DID HE ATTACK IT!?

00:12:52.902 --> 00:12:55.941
I PLACE THIS FACEDOWN
AND END MY TURN!

00:12:55.941 --> 00:12:59.414
Thinking:
YUGI BETTER NOT LET THIS CHUMP
DEFEAT HIM AGAIN!

00:12:59.414 --> 00:13:01.786
I'M THE ONLY ONE
WHO DESERVES THAT GLORY!

00:13:01.786 --> 00:13:04.657
TIME TO FINISH YOU OFF!

00:13:04.657 --> 00:13:06.360
Yami-Yugi:
NOT SO FAST!

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.831
I'M USING
MY UNDERWORLD
CIRCLE CARD

00:13:08.831 --> 00:13:11.836
TO BRING BACK
MY QUEEN'S KNIGHT!

00:13:11.836 --> 00:13:15.609
JUST FACE IT!
YOUR STRATEGY'S
NOT WORKING!

00:13:15.609 --> 00:13:18.549
NOW, WATCH THIS!

00:13:18.549 --> 00:13:21.120
BY DISCARDING ONE CARD,

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:24.458
I CAN ACTIVATE
THE ORICHALCOS
SWORD OF SEALING!

00:13:27.364 --> 00:13:29.836
WELL, THAT'S GONNA
LEAVE A MARK...

00:13:29.836 --> 00:13:31.772
WOULDN'T YA SAY,
TIMAEUS?

00:13:31.772 --> 00:13:33.141
AND NOW, DREADSCYTHE,

00:13:33.141 --> 00:13:38.016
ATTACK DARK MAGICIAN GIRL
THE DRAGON KNIGHT!

00:13:38.016 --> 00:13:39.552
NO!
PHARAOH!
PHARAOH!

00:13:39.552 --> 00:13:43.226
THIS DUEL'S OVER!

00:13:43.226 --> 00:13:49.270
[SCREAMING]

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:50.505
HEY, WAIT!!

00:13:50.505 --> 00:13:52.977
HOW CAN YOU
BE STANDING!?

00:13:52.977 --> 00:13:55.448
I'VE ACTIVATED
MY REDUCTION BARRIER!

00:13:55.448 --> 00:13:58.219
WHICH MEANS THE NUMBER
OF LIFE POINTS I LOSE

00:13:58.219 --> 00:14:00.357
IS REDUCED TO 10%.

00:14:00.357 --> 00:14:02.093
HE SAVED
HIMSELF!

00:14:02.093 --> 00:14:04.464
YEAH, BUT HE'S
ONLY GOT 10 LIFE
POINTS LEFT.

00:14:04.464 --> 00:14:05.866
OH, MAN!

00:14:05.866 --> 00:14:07.937
THIS DUEL'S
STILL ON!

00:14:07.937 --> 00:14:10.041
I'LL FIGHT 'TIL
MY LAST POINT
IS GONE!

00:14:10.041 --> 00:14:12.879
AND THAT'S
A PROMISE, RAFAEL!

00:14:12.879 --> 00:14:15.651
SUIT YOURSELF.
IT WON'T BE LONG NOW.

00:14:15.651 --> 00:14:17.387
AND ONCE I CRUSH YOU...

00:14:17.387 --> 00:14:20.058
YOUR SOUL WILL BELONG
TO MASTER DARTZ!

00:14:20.058 --> 00:14:21.895
YOU'VE BEEN
BRAINWASHED!

00:14:21.895 --> 00:14:24.300
BLINDED BY
YOUR OWN DARKNESS!

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:26.938
BUT I BELIEVE
THERE'S STILL
GOOD INSIDE YOU!

00:14:26.938 --> 00:14:29.542
AND I PLAN
TO BRING IT OUT

00:14:29.542 --> 00:14:31.345
WITH THIS MOVE!

00:14:31.345 --> 00:14:34.217
FIRST I'LL USE
THE MAGIC OF
UNDERWORLD CIRCLE

00:14:34.217 --> 00:14:36.321
TO BRING
MY BIG SHIELD GARDNA

00:14:36.321 --> 00:14:39.160
BACK TO THE FIELD!

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.898
THEN I'LL ACTIVATE
MY POT OF GREED!

00:14:41.898 --> 00:14:43.968
THIS LETS ME DRAW
TWO CARDS!

00:14:43.968 --> 00:14:45.738
Thinking: EXCELLENT.

00:14:45.738 --> 00:14:48.643
THAT'S JUST THE CARD
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR!

00:14:48.643 --> 00:14:51.181
TIME TO FACE
WHAT YOU DID...

00:14:51.181 --> 00:14:53.185
WHEN YOU BETRAYED
YOUR HEART!

00:14:53.185 --> 00:14:57.025
FOR NOW I ACTIVATE
THE MAGIC CARD
SPIDER WEB,

00:14:57.025 --> 00:15:00.230
WHICH LETS ME USE A CARD
FROM YOUR GRAVEYARD!

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:02.401
WHAT'S THE POINT
OF ALL THIS!?

00:15:02.401 --> 00:15:04.137
I'M USING
MY SPIDER WEB

00:15:04.137 --> 00:15:07.210
TO BRING BACK
YOUR MONSTER
REBORN CARD!

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:10.382
AND I'M PLANNING ON
USING IT TO SAVE YOU

00:15:10.382 --> 00:15:13.921
BY SETTING YOU FREE
FROM THE DARKNESS!

00:15:13.921 --> 00:15:15.591
YEAH,
WHATEVER.

00:15:15.591 --> 00:15:17.428
I USE MONSTER REBORN

00:15:17.428 --> 00:15:20.266
TO REVIVE A CREATURE
THAT ONCE SAVED YOUR LIFE

00:15:20.266 --> 00:15:22.570
AND THAT YOU, IN TURN,
DESERTED!

00:15:30.384 --> 00:15:32.087
EATOS.

00:15:32.087 --> 00:15:34.591
Tea: WHAT'S HE GONNA
DO WITH THAT CARD?

00:15:34.591 --> 00:15:36.395
Mokuba:
HOPEFULLY WIN.

00:15:36.395 --> 00:15:38.699
ONE MORE THING.

00:15:38.699 --> 00:15:40.102
Thinking: JOEY...

00:15:40.102 --> 00:15:43.809
I CAN ONLY ACCOMPLISH THIS
WITH YOUR HELP.

00:15:43.809 --> 00:15:46.680
I SUMMON THE CLAW OF HERMOS!

00:15:52.256 --> 00:15:54.894
HEY, JOEY!
CHECK IT OUT, MAN!

00:15:54.894 --> 00:15:58.734
HE JUST SUMMONED
YOUR BOY!

00:15:58.734 --> 00:16:01.139
AND NOW,
HERMOS AND QUEEN'S KNIGHT...

00:16:01.139 --> 00:16:05.481
COMBINE TOGETHER
TO FORM GODDESS BOW!

00:16:05.481 --> 00:16:11.157
THAT DOUBLES THE ATTACK POINTS
OF GUARDIAN EATOS!

00:16:11.157 --> 00:16:14.430
AND SINCE EATOS
HAS BEEN REMOVED
FROM YOUR GRAVEYARD,

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:19.105
YOUR DREADSCYTHE
GETS WEAKER!

00:16:19.105 --> 00:16:22.979
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?
OUR MONSTERS ARE EVEN NOW.

00:16:22.979 --> 00:16:25.550
SO IF YOU ATTACK,
THEY'RE BOTH DESTROYED.

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:27.353
BUT MINE COMES BACK!

00:16:27.353 --> 00:16:29.590
WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT!

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:31.728
I HAVE A FEW MORE
SURPRISES PLANNED!

00:16:36.262 --> 00:16:40.671
Yami-Yugi: EATOS,
ATTACK HIS DREADSCYTHE NOW!

00:16:40.671 --> 00:16:44.076
I ACTIVATE THE SPECIAL ABILITY
OF MY GODDESS BOW!

00:16:44.076 --> 00:16:47.983
NOW EVERY TIME YOUR DREADSCYTHE
REVIVES ITSELF,

00:16:47.983 --> 00:16:52.825
EATOS CAN ATTACK AGAIN!

00:16:52.825 --> 00:16:57.500
NO!

00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:58.703
Yami-Yugi:
AND DON'T FORGET,

00:16:58.703 --> 00:17:01.474
WITH EACH ATTACK,
YOU LOSE ANOTHER CARD!

00:17:01.474 --> 00:17:02.810
OF COURSE!

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:04.814
IF RAFAEL RUNS
OUT OF CARDS,

00:17:04.814 --> 00:17:07.552
HIS MONSTER
CAN'T COME BACK!

00:17:07.552 --> 00:17:09.756
Yami-Yugi:
THE DARK FLAME
OF YOUR DREADSCYTHE

00:17:09.756 --> 00:17:14.097
IS NOW EXTINGUISHED.

00:17:14.097 --> 00:17:16.034
COME BACK!

00:17:20.975 --> 00:17:23.313
NOW DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'VE DONE?

00:17:23.313 --> 00:17:25.984
YOU TURNED YOUR BACK
ON YOUR MONSTERS.

00:17:25.984 --> 00:17:28.823
AT ONE TIME, THEY MEANT
THE WORLD TO YOU.

00:17:28.823 --> 00:17:30.726
BUT THEN DARTZ
CONVINCED YOU

00:17:30.726 --> 00:17:33.899
TO ABANDON EVERYTHING
THAT WAS IMPORTANT
TO YOU.

00:17:33.899 --> 00:17:37.471
HE FED YOU LIES
ABOUT YOUR FAMILY
AND FUELED YOUR RAGE.

00:17:37.471 --> 00:17:39.442
AND IN A MOMENT
OF WEAKNESS,

00:17:39.442 --> 00:17:42.113
YOU ALLOWED YOUR HEART
TO BECOME CONSUMED

00:17:42.113 --> 00:17:45.253
BY THE DARK MAGIC
OF THE ORICHALCOS.

00:17:45.253 --> 00:17:46.955
BUT I COULD TELL
THE REAL YOU

00:17:46.955 --> 00:17:49.560
WAS STILL IN THERE
FIGHTING TO BREAK FREE.

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:51.931
AND I KNEW
WHAT I HAD TO DO...

00:17:51.931 --> 00:17:54.169
FORCE YOU TO FACE
THE DARKNESS.

00:17:54.169 --> 00:17:57.007
THERE'S ONLY ONE PROBLEM
WITH YOUR PLAN, PHARAOH.

00:17:57.007 --> 00:18:01.080
THE SEAL OF ORICHALCOS
STILL NEEDS TO CAPTURE
ONE OF OUR SOULS.

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:04.587
SO WHATTA YA SAY
WE FINISH THIS OFF
AND SEE WHO GOES.

00:18:04.587 --> 00:18:06.056
NO! WAIT!

00:18:06.056 --> 00:18:08.861
TOO LATE! MY MOVE!

00:18:08.861 --> 00:18:11.700
I'LL USE THE POWER
OF UNDERWORLD CIRCLE

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:15.540
TO BRING BACK
MY GUARDIAN GRARL!

00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:17.243
WHAT ARE YOU
PLANNING TO DO?

00:18:17.243 --> 00:18:21.785
NEXT I'LL ACTIVATE
MY SOUL CHARGE MAGIC CARD,

00:18:21.785 --> 00:18:26.526
ALLOWING ME TO SUMMON
EVEN MORE MONSTERS
FROM MY GRAVEYARD!

00:18:26.526 --> 00:18:28.897
WHOA! THAT'S
4 MONSTERS!

00:18:28.897 --> 00:18:32.403
LOOK, ANY MONSTER
THAT'S SUMMONED BY
USING SOUL CHARGE

00:18:32.403 --> 00:18:34.875
CAN'T ATTACK
FOR ONE TURN,
SO HE'S SAFE.

00:18:34.875 --> 00:18:37.479
THEN WHY DO IT?
WHAT'S HIS PLAN?

00:18:37.479 --> 00:18:38.982
WELL, THAT'S IT.

00:18:38.982 --> 00:18:41.586
MY GRAVEYARD IS
COMPLETELY EMPTY.

00:18:41.586 --> 00:18:43.089
MY GUARDIANS ARE FREE.

00:18:43.089 --> 00:18:45.794
THAT'S TRUE. NOW WHAT?

00:18:45.794 --> 00:18:48.900
I THINK YOU KNOW, PHARAOH.

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:51.104
EACH MONSTER
I BROUGHT BACK
FROM THE GRAVE

00:18:51.104 --> 00:18:53.775
COST ME 500 POINTS.

00:18:53.775 --> 00:18:56.179
GAME OVER.

00:18:56.179 --> 00:18:57.415
RAFAEL!!

00:18:57.415 --> 00:18:58.450
[GASP]

00:19:08.569 --> 00:19:13.578
IT'S EATOS.

00:19:13.578 --> 00:19:16.416
Yami-Yugi: YOU'VE
MADE THE CORRECT
CHOICE, RAFAEL.

00:19:16.416 --> 00:19:21.391
THE DARKNESS
HAS LIFTED.

00:19:21.391 --> 00:19:24.363
YOU'RE RIGHT. THANK YOU.

00:19:24.363 --> 00:19:25.665
RAFAEL!

00:19:25.665 --> 00:19:27.335
WE MISSED YOU!

00:19:27.335 --> 00:19:28.972
WE'LL SEE YA SOON!

00:19:28.972 --> 00:19:30.708
YEAH! REAL SOON!

00:19:30.708 --> 00:19:33.412
Rafael, thinking:
I GET IT NOW.

00:19:33.412 --> 00:19:35.617
THIS IS A VISION
OF WHAT'S INSIDE MY HEART.

00:19:35.617 --> 00:19:39.423
EVERYONE I TURNED MY BACK ON
IS STILL HERE.

00:19:39.423 --> 00:19:41.894
AND THEY'LL ALWAYS BE
WITH ME.

00:19:56.721 --> 00:19:57.789
HUH?

00:19:57.789 --> 00:20:00.227
RAFAEL!!

00:20:00.227 --> 00:20:02.398
HEY, THE SEAL IS GONE!

00:20:02.398 --> 00:20:04.235
WHERE'D IT GO?

00:20:04.235 --> 00:20:07.206
DOESN'T IT USUALLY
PUT ON A BIG GREEN
LASER SHOW?

00:20:07.206 --> 00:20:10.378
Rafael: YEAH,
AND IT USUALLY TAKES
SOMEONE'S SOUL, TOO.

00:20:10.378 --> 00:20:11.614
Tea: WAIT.

00:20:11.614 --> 00:20:13.217
SO YOU'RE
STILL HERE?!

00:20:13.217 --> 00:20:14.453
I'M LOST.

00:20:14.453 --> 00:20:15.789
Yami-Yugi:
I HAVE A THEORY.

00:20:15.789 --> 00:20:17.091
THE SEAL
OF ORICHALCOS

00:20:17.091 --> 00:20:18.794
IS POWERED
BY THE DARKNESS

00:20:18.794 --> 00:20:21.098
WITHIN THE PERSON
WHO PLAYS IT,

00:20:21.098 --> 00:20:24.270
BUT RAFAEL WAS ABLE TO
CONQUER THAT DARKNESS.

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:29.079
SO MY SOUL WAS SPARED!
I'M FREE.

00:20:29.079 --> 00:20:30.481
[RUMBLING]

00:20:30.481 --> 00:20:32.518
Tea: WHAT'S
GOING ON!?

00:20:32.518 --> 00:20:34.321
OH, NO!

00:20:34.321 --> 00:20:36.358
OH, YES.

00:20:36.358 --> 00:20:38.400
Tristan:
WHAT!? IS IT
AN EARTHQUAKE!?

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:40.702
Yami-Yugi: I'M AFRAID
IT'S MUCH WORSE THAN THAT!
