00:00:05.163 --> 00:00:07.966
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF MY NEWEST SOLDIERS?

00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:10.836
I'M SURE THERE'S NO NEED
FOR ANY INTRODUCTIONS.

THAT'S ENOUGH!

00:00:12.704 --> 00:00:14.773
JUST DROP THE MAGIC ACT

TO LET THEM PLAY ALONG WITH US.

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:30.055
ALRIGHT!
THIS ENDS NOW!

00:00:30.055 --> 00:00:32.624
HOW RIGHT YOU ARE.

00:00:32.624 --> 00:00:36.862
I'M JUST ABOUT DONE.
ONCE I PLAY THIS CARD...

00:00:36.862 --> 00:00:40.632
FOR THE SEAL OF ORICHALCOS

00:02:14.192 --> 00:02:17.229
HOW CAN THE SEAL
POSSIBLY GET ANY
STRONGER!?

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:19.898
WE'RE DEALING
WITH A FORCE GREATER
THAN THE DARKEST SHADOWS

00:02:19.898 --> 00:02:21.600
AND OLDER THAN TIME ITSELF.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.836
DOES THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION?

00:02:24.836 --> 00:02:26.171

THIS IS GOOD-BYE.

00:02:39.251 --> 00:02:41.753
WITH AN ATTACK STRENGTH
OF ONLY 1,400,

00:02:41.753 --> 00:02:43.622
YOUR DRAGON
IS FAR TOO WEAK

00:02:43.622 --> 00:02:44.623
TO DEFEND
YOUR LIFE POINTS.

00:02:44.623 --> 00:02:45.857
SO THAT MEANS...

00:02:45.857 --> 00:02:47.092
YOU LOSE!

00:02:47.092 --> 00:02:50.795

IS IT BEGINNING
TO SINK IN YET?

00:03:01.706 --> 00:03:04.075
WHEN USED PROPERLY,
THE SEAL OF ORICHALCOS

00:03:04.075 --> 00:03:06.578
IS UNMATCHED BY ANY
OTHER CARD IN THE GAME!

00:03:06.578 --> 00:03:08.713
AND DUE TO
ITS THIRD LAYER,

00:03:08.713 --> 00:03:11.283
YOUR MAGIC AND TRAP CARDS
ARE USELESS AGAINST ME!

00:03:11.283 --> 00:03:13.351
Voice-over: DARTZ IS RIGHT.

00:03:13.351 --> 00:03:16.021

THE DUEL--AND WORSE, HIS SOUL!

00:18:18.587 --> 00:18:20.589
HEAR MY CALL.

00:18:20.589 --> 00:18:23.592
ARISE...
OBELISK THE TORMENTOR!!!

00:18:28.698 --> 00:18:30.666
THE GREAT POWER
OF THE SHADOWS...

00:18:30.666 --> 00:18:33.769
IS IN MY HAND!

00:18:33.769 --> 00:18:35.304
OBELISK!

00:18:35.304 --> 00:18:38.474
SUBDUE THIS INTRUDER
WITH YOUR FIST OF FURY!

00:18:43.446 --> 00:18:45.648
WHY ARE WE
WATCHING THIS!?

00:18:45.648 --> 00:18:48.117
BECAUSE IT WAS
ON THIS VERY DAY

00:18:48.117 --> 00:18:50.119
THAT I FIRST REALIZED
THE GREAT LEVIATHAN

00:18:50.119 --> 00:18:51.687
WOULD RISE AGAIN!

00:18:51.687 --> 00:18:53.122
AND IT'S
ALL BECAUSE OF YOU

00:18:53.122 --> 00:18:55.658
AND THE MAGIC THAT
YOU WIELD.

00:18:55.658 --> 00:18:59.595
ONCE ATLANTIS WAS DESTROYED
AND LEVIATHAN WAS LAID TO REST,

00:18:59.595 --> 00:19:02.498
I WAS FORCED TO
WANDER THE EARTH AND WAIT.

00:19:02.498 --> 00:19:05.334
AFTER ALL, I COULDN'T
WIPE OUT MANKIND ON MY OWN.

00:19:05.334 --> 00:19:07.703
I NEEDED POWER.

00:19:07.703 --> 00:19:12.608
THAT'S WHERE YOU CAME IN.

00:19:12.608 --> 00:19:14.376
SEE FOR YOURSELF.

00:19:19.181 --> 00:19:21.350
[YELLING]

00:19:25.755 --> 00:19:27.757
Dartz: I SENSED IT IMMEDIATELY.

00:19:27.757 --> 00:19:31.260
YOUR LIFE ENERGY
WAS EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED.

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:33.462
BUT THE TIME WASN'T RIGHT.

00:19:33.462 --> 00:19:34.830
SO MY WAIT CONTINUED.

00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:36.432
BUT WHY?

00:19:36.432 --> 00:19:38.100
IF YOU NEEDED MY POWER,

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:40.236
THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU
CONFRONT ME BACK THEN?

00:19:40.236 --> 00:19:42.138
BECAUSE THERE WAS
ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL

00:19:42.138 --> 00:19:43.773
THREATENING
TO DESTROY THE PLANET,

00:19:43.773 --> 00:19:46.108
AND QUITE FRANKLY,
HE WAS IN MY WAY.

00:19:46.108 --> 00:19:48.611
BUT I KNEW MY DAY WOULD COME.

00:19:48.611 --> 00:19:50.579
AND IT DID...

00:19:50.579 --> 00:19:54.150
5,000 YEARS LATER
WHEN A NAIVE YOUNG MAN

00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:58.420
UNLOCKED THE DARK MAGIC.

00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:02.124
WITH THAT CAME THE RETURN
OF THE SHADOW GAMES...

00:20:02.124 --> 00:20:04.093
AND THE REBIRTH
OF THE PHARAOH...

00:20:04.093 --> 00:20:07.730
AND HIS RIVALS.

00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:10.065
SO THAT'S WHY YOU'VE
BEEN TARGETING
MY FRIENDS.

00:20:10.065 --> 00:20:11.634
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:20:11.634 --> 00:20:13.135
YOU SHOULD BE FLATTERED.

00:20:13.135 --> 00:20:14.770
NEVER BEFORE
HAVE I ENCOUNTERED

00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:16.472
SUCH A POWERFUL GROUP
OF SOULS.

00:20:16.472 --> 00:20:17.573
YOU'RE SICK!

00:20:17.573 --> 00:20:19.441
OH, I'M THE SICK ONE?

00:20:19.441 --> 00:20:21.544
THE FACT REMAINS
THAT YOU USHERED IN

00:20:21.544 --> 00:20:24.346
THE AGE OF THE SHADOW GAMES
5,000 YEARS AGO

00:20:24.346 --> 00:20:26.148
AND NEARLY WIPED OUT
YOUR WHOLE KINGDOM!

00:20:26.148 --> 00:20:27.550
THAT'S A LIE!

00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:29.718
I SAW IT ALL.

00:20:29.718 --> 00:20:33.522
THE WAY YOU CONJURED UP
CREATURES OF DARKNESS
TO DO YOUR BIDDING.

00:20:33.522 --> 00:20:36.325
YOU'RE EVIL, PHARAOH,
AND THERE'S NO DENYING IT!

00:20:36.325 --> 00:20:38.661
AND SOON YOU'LL GET
WHAT YOU DESERVE

00:20:38.661 --> 00:20:41.530
WHEN I FEED YOUR SOUL
TO THE GREAT LEVIATHAN!

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:45.067
AND COMPLETE THAT WHICH
I STARTED CENTURIES AGO!
