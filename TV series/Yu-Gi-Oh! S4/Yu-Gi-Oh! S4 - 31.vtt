IT'S ABOUT TIME
YOU SHOWED UP
FOR OUR REMATCH.

00:00:06.775 --> 00:00:09.546
THIS DOESN'T
CONCERN YOU, RAFAEL.

I'M HERE TO SEE DARTZ.

AS WE SPEAK,

00:00:12.751 --> 00:00:15.289
THE GREAT LEVIATHAN
LURKS IN THE SHADOWS
ALL OVER THE EARTH,

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:17.360
AND AS SOON
AS I DEFEAT YOU

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.131
YOUR LIFE ENERGY
WILL BE OFFERED
TO THE BEAST.

THIS MADNESS HAS
TO STOP.

00:00:22.202 --> 00:00:25.775
IT'S TIME TO REMIND YOU
WHY I'VE ALREADY
CRUSHED YOU ONCE.

00:00:25.775 --> 00:00:28.313
YOU REMEMBER
GRAVITY AXE, DON'T YOU?

00:00:28.313 --> 00:00:31.720

TO CALL FORTH
THE 5 KURIBOH BROTHERS.

00:00:39.633 --> 00:00:43.407
NOW I PLAY
THE SEAL OF ORICHALCOS.

NO, RAFAEL!

00:00:44.576 --> 00:00:46.412
PLEASE, DON'T!

00:00:46.412 --> 00:00:47.581
SORRY, PHARAOH.

00:00:47.581 --> 00:00:49.752
IT'S TOO LATE FOR THAT NOW.

NOW ONE OF US
IS GOING TO LOSE

OF THE ORICHALCOS
HAS NO EQUAL.

OF ITS BOUNDLESS ENERGY

I JUST ACTIVATED
MY DARK MAGIC CURTAIN.

00:04:17.092 --> 00:04:18.328

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.755

HALF OF HIS LIFE POINTS.

00:04:33.755 --> 00:04:35.826

THE SEAL OF ORICHALCOS
GIVES ME AN EXTRA
ROW OF MONSTERS,

00:04:57.198 --> 00:05:01.138
SO MY TRAP CARD
MOVED ELMA TO THE BACK ROW.

WITHOUT GOING THROUGH

00:05:34.298 --> 00:05:38.238
NOW I'LL DRAW TWO CARDS.

00:05:38.238 --> 00:05:43.648
THE TIME HAS COME
TO PLAY THE CARD
THAT BEAT YOU LAST TIME.

00:05:43.648 --> 00:05:45.919
IT'S MY GUARDIAN EATOS.

00:05:54.668 --> 00:05:57.239
I HAVE TO ACT QUICKLY.

00:05:57.239 --> 00:06:01.681
WITH 500 POINTS LEFT,
I DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME.

00:06:16.741 --> 00:06:19.212
LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE
TO YOUR GUARDIAN.

00:06:19.212 --> 00:06:21.917
IT'S BEEN CONSUMED
BY DARKNESS.

00:06:21.917 --> 00:06:25.190
EXACTLY, AND IT'S MORE
POWERFUL THAN EVER NOW.

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:29.197
NOTHING CAN STOP IT.

00:06:29.197 --> 00:06:31.701
I HAVE TO DISAGREE.

00:06:31.701 --> 00:06:34.773
OBSERVE!

00:06:34.773 --> 00:06:37.044
WHEN KURIBANDIT
IS SACRIFICED,

00:06:37.044 --> 00:06:39.615
I CAN DRAW 5 MORE CARDS.

00:06:39.615 --> 00:06:40.784
HOWEVER,
I'M ONLY ALLOWED

00:06:40.784 --> 00:06:42.921
TO KEEP THE MAGIC
AND TRAP CARDS.

00:06:42.921 --> 00:06:45.860
MY MONSTERS GO STRAIGHT
TO THE GRAVEYARD.

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.429
YUGI, DON'T DO IT.

00:06:47.429 --> 00:06:50.168
THAT'LL JUST MAKE
EATOS MORE POWERFUL.

00:06:50.168 --> 00:06:52.606
THAT'S TRUE,
BUT IT COULD'VE BEEN
WORTH THE RISK

00:06:52.606 --> 00:06:54.375
IF YUGI DREW
THE RIGHT CARD.

00:06:54.375 --> 00:06:56.546
I GUESS
WE'LL FIND OUT NOW.

00:06:56.546 --> 00:06:59.885
Kaiba, voice-over:
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU GOT.

00:06:59.885 --> 00:07:02.523
I KEPT 2
AND DISCARDED 3.

00:07:02.523 --> 00:07:05.228
THEN THE STRENGTH
OF THE 3 MONSTERS
YOU DISCARDED

00:07:05.228 --> 00:07:07.131
IS ADDED TO MY GUARDIAN.

00:07:07.131 --> 00:07:12.140
EATOS, RAISE YOUR SWORD
AND DRAIN HIS MONSTERS' POWER.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.805
7,000? WHAT?

00:07:29.805 --> 00:07:32.544
YOU'RE ABOUT TO BECOME
A TWO-TIME LOSER,

00:07:32.544 --> 00:07:36.751
AND THIS TIME
YOU'RE GONNA PAY UP
WITH YOUR SOUL.

00:07:36.751 --> 00:07:40.892
EATOS ATTACK NOW.

00:07:40.892 --> 00:07:42.762
GAME OVER.

00:07:42.762 --> 00:07:43.764
Both: YUGI!

00:07:43.764 --> 00:07:44.765
Tea: NO!

00:07:50.576 --> 00:07:52.112
SAY WHAT?

00:07:52.112 --> 00:07:54.985
ALLOW ME TO CLEAR
THINGS UP FOR YOU.

00:07:54.985 --> 00:07:58.691
A FEW MOMENTS AGO
I SENT 3 MONSTERS
TO MY GRAVEYARD,

00:07:58.691 --> 00:08:00.027
ONE OF WHICH SAVED ME.

00:08:00.027 --> 00:08:02.498
THAT CARD WAS THIS,

00:08:02.498 --> 00:08:04.836
MY ELECTROMAGNETIC
TURTLE.

00:08:04.836 --> 00:08:06.338
WHEN THIS MONSTER
WAS DESTROYED

00:08:06.338 --> 00:08:08.508
IT CREATED AN
ELECTROMAGNETIC BARRIER,

00:08:08.508 --> 00:08:11.447
SHIELDING MY MAGICIAN
FROM YOUR ATTACK.

00:08:11.447 --> 00:08:12.683
NO WAY.

00:08:12.683 --> 00:08:14.519
HE HAD THAT PLANNED
ALL ALONG.

00:08:14.519 --> 00:08:18.026
IN YOUR FACE,
MEATHEAD.

00:08:18.026 --> 00:08:19.863

00:08:23.268 --> 00:08:25.005
I END MY TURN!

00:08:25.005 --> 00:08:26.675
PERHAPS YOU SHOULD
HAVE THOUGHT TWICE

00:08:26.675 --> 00:08:28.845
BEFORE YOU POISONED
YOUR OWN MONSTERS

00:08:28.845 --> 00:08:31.350
WITH THE DARK POWERS
OF THE ORICHALCOS.

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:33.921
TAKE IT FROM SOMEONE
WITH EXPERIENCE.

00:08:33.921 --> 00:08:37.361
BETRAYING YOUR MONSTERS
ONLY BACKFIRES
IN THE END.

00:08:37.361 --> 00:08:39.932
YOU PLAYED
THE SEAL OF ORICHALCOS ONCE

00:08:39.932 --> 00:08:42.135
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN
YOU'RE AN EXPERT
ON THE SUBJECT?

00:08:42.135 --> 00:08:43.171
JUST GO.

00:08:43.171 --> 00:08:44.573
AS YOU WISH.

00:08:44.573 --> 00:08:50.584
NOW I SUMMON
BIG SHIELD GARDNA
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:08:50.584 --> 00:08:55.693
NEXT I'LL SWITCH
MY DARK MAGICIAN
INTO DEFENSE MODE,

00:08:55.693 --> 00:08:58.899
THEN I'LL PLACE
ONE CARD FACE DOWN
AND END MY TURN.

00:08:58.899 --> 00:09:01.704
IT'S OVER.

00:09:01.704 --> 00:09:04.710
YOU CAN'T WIN A DUEL
WITH DEFENSE, PHARAOH.

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:07.548
ALL YOU'RE DOING
IS STALLING FOR TIME.

00:09:07.548 --> 00:09:10.687
WELL, I'M AFRAID
YOUR TIME'S JUST RUN OUT.

00:09:10.687 --> 00:09:14.160

VALUABLE MONSTER,

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:19.336
THE DARK MAGICIAN.

00:09:19.336 --> 00:09:20.338
OH, NO!

00:09:20.338 --> 00:09:21.340
PHARAOH!

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:22.509
DO SOMETHING!

00:09:22.509 --> 00:09:24.345
MAGICAL HATS, ACTIVATE.

00:09:24.345 --> 00:09:26.249
HIDE MY MONSTERS.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:33.829
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:09:33.829 --> 00:09:34.898
AWESOME.

00:09:34.898 --> 00:09:37.736
MAGICAL HATS SHUFFLED
YUGI'S MONSTERS

00:09:37.736 --> 00:09:40.307
SO BLONDIE BLASTED
THE WRONG ONE.

00:09:40.307 --> 00:09:43.580
THAT'S TRUE,
BUT HE GETS TO
ATTACK AGAIN,

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:46.485
SO YUGI'S MAGICIAN'S
STILL IN DANGER.

00:09:46.485 --> 00:09:51.027
ALL RIGHT, 1 OF THESE
3 REMAINING HATS IS
CONCEALING MY MONSTER,

00:09:51.027 --> 00:09:52.429
SO GO AHEAD.

00:09:52.429 --> 00:09:54.232
HIT ME WITH
YOUR BEST SHOT.

00:09:54.232 --> 00:09:56.370
Rafael, voice-over:
3 HATS AND 1 MONSTER.

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:58.607
I KNOW WHAT I HAFTA DO.

00:09:58.607 --> 00:10:01.245
I'LL USE ELMA
TO IMPROVE MY ODDS,

00:10:01.245 --> 00:10:04.351
THEN I'LL SEND IN GRARL
TO FINISH THINGS OFF.

00:10:04.351 --> 00:10:05.854
GO, ELMA.

00:10:05.854 --> 00:10:11.029
FIND HIS DARK MAGICIAN.

00:10:11.029 --> 00:10:13.200
NOW I HAVE A 50-50 SHOT.

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.404
GUARDIAN GRARL, ATTACK.

00:10:20.881 --> 00:10:22.550
WRONG HAT!

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:23.886
OH, NO.

00:10:23.886 --> 00:10:25.288
WHAT A SHAME.

00:10:25.288 --> 00:10:28.361
LOOKS LIKE YOU USED UP
ALL OF YOUR CHANCES.

00:10:28.361 --> 00:10:30.130
Rafael, voice-over:
HOW COULD I HAVE
MESSED THAT UP?

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:34.137
I WAS ABOUT TO WIN THE DUEL
AND CAPTURE THE PHARAOH.

00:10:34.137 --> 00:10:36.275
MY TURN'S NOT OVER
JUST YET.

00:10:36.275 --> 00:10:42.286
I ACTIVATE
MY ROD OF SILENCE.

00:10:42.286 --> 00:10:45.926
THIS LETS ME PLAY
ANOTHER GUARDIAN MONSTER,

00:10:45.926 --> 00:10:49.199
MY ALL-POWERFUL
GUARDIAN KAY'EST.

00:11:01.086 --> 00:11:03.924
THAT ENDS MY TURN.

00:11:03.924 --> 00:11:05.394
THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE.

00:11:05.394 --> 00:11:09.368
ALL RIGHT,
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING
THAT CAN SAVE HIM NOW.

00:11:09.368 --> 00:11:13.408
LET'S SEE IF HE HAS
WHAT IT TAKES
TO PLAY IT.

00:11:13.408 --> 00:11:14.878
LET'S MOVE ON.

00:11:14.878 --> 00:11:19.553
FIRST, I ACTIVATE
THE MAGIC CARD
GRACEFUL CHARITY.

00:11:19.553 --> 00:11:24.161
THIS ALLOWS ME
TO DRAW 3 NEW CARDS
AS LONG AS I DISCARD 2.

00:11:24.161 --> 00:11:26.398
Yami-Yugi, voice-over:
THIS IS MY FINAL CHANCE.

00:11:26.398 --> 00:11:29.604
PLEASE,
HEART OF THE CARDS,
GUIDE ME.

00:11:35.782 --> 00:11:38.787
SORRY TO DISAPPOINT YOU.

00:11:38.787 --> 00:11:39.956
DON'T TELL ME.

00:11:39.956 --> 00:11:41.993
I'M AFRAID IT'S TRUE.

00:11:41.993 --> 00:11:45.433
I'VE DRAWN
THE EYE OF TIMAEUS!

00:11:45.433 --> 00:11:48.705
AND NOW TIMAEUS, ARISE!

00:11:58.389 --> 00:11:59.892
THIS IS NUTS.

00:11:59.892 --> 00:12:01.696
HE DID IT.

00:12:01.696 --> 00:12:05.369
NOW I MERGE MY DRAGON
WITH MY DARK MAGICIAN.

00:12:05.369 --> 00:12:10.378
COMBINE TO FORM
AMULET DRAGON!

00:12:19.693 --> 00:12:21.797
MY NEW DRAGON
GETS 300 POINTS

00:12:21.797 --> 00:12:23.901
FOR EACH MAGIC CARD
IN MY GRAVEYARD.

00:12:23.901 --> 00:12:25.304
OH, NO.

00:12:25.304 --> 00:12:28.576
AND IN CASE YOU
HAVEN'T BEEN COUNTING,

00:12:28.576 --> 00:12:30.146
THAT'S 8,

00:12:30.146 --> 00:12:31.815
WHICH MEANS
MY AMULET DRAGON

00:12:31.815 --> 00:12:35.922
GETS AN EXTRA 2,400
ATTACK POINTS.

00:12:35.922 --> 00:12:37.425
WHO'S DA MAN?

00:12:37.425 --> 00:12:39.262
HE IS!

00:12:39.262 --> 00:12:40.765
THE TIME HAS COME.

00:12:40.765 --> 00:12:42.835
AMULET DRAGON, ATTACK!

00:12:42.835 --> 00:12:45.206
DESTROY HIS
GUARDIAN EATOS.

00:12:52.352 --> 00:12:55.892
EATOS, NO!

00:12:58.696 --> 00:13:03.105
I STILL NEED YOU.

00:13:03.105 --> 00:13:06.344
COME BACK.

00:13:06.344 --> 00:13:11.921
YOU'RE GONNA BE SORRY,
PHARAOH.

00:13:11.921 --> 00:13:15.527
NOBODY SENDS
MY GUARDIAN EATOS
TO THE GRAVEYARD.

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:22.774
RAFAEL,
WHAT'RE YOU UP TO?

00:13:22.774 --> 00:13:25.512
THAT'S CREEPY.

00:13:25.512 --> 00:13:28.250
Tea: WHY'S THE SEAL
DOING THAT?

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:31.456
Kaiba, voice-over:
IT MUST BE A GLITCH
IN THE HOLOGRAM.

00:13:31.456 --> 00:13:33.927
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:13:33.927 --> 00:13:38.101
MY GUARDIAN EATOS
IS A CREATURE OF LIGHT
AND PURITY,

00:13:38.101 --> 00:13:42.610
AND WHEN IT'S DESTROYED
IT'S REPLACED BY
A DIFFERENT CREATURE--

00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:44.813
A CREATURE OF DARKNESS.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:57.303
WHAT'S THAT?

00:13:57.303 --> 00:13:59.306
I'VE GOT ONE WORD--
NASTY.

00:13:59.306 --> 00:14:04.382
HERE'S 4--
I'M GONNA BE SICK.

00:14:04.382 --> 00:14:07.454
FOR THE LAST TIME,
WHAT IS THAT THING?

00:14:07.454 --> 00:14:09.057
I TOLD YOU.

00:14:09.057 --> 00:14:11.461
WHEN EATOS
GOES TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:14:11.461 --> 00:14:14.901
THIS MONSTER
IS SUMMONED TO THE FIELD
IN ITS PLACE.

00:14:14.901 --> 00:14:20.010
SO SAY HELLO
TO MY GUARDIAN DREADSCYTHE.

00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:22.915
HELLO...AND GOOD-BYE.

00:14:22.915 --> 00:14:25.353
IT'S NO MATCH
FOR MY DRAGON.

00:14:25.353 --> 00:14:27.424
IT WILL BE.

00:14:27.424 --> 00:14:29.527
FIRST, I'LL BOOST
ITS STRENGTH

00:14:29.527 --> 00:14:34.336
WITH MY REAPER SCYTHE
MAGIC CARD.

00:14:34.336 --> 00:14:35.838
NOW FOR THE BEST PART.

00:14:35.838 --> 00:14:37.909
THANKS TO ITS NEW WEAPON,

00:14:37.909 --> 00:14:41.582
MY GUARDIAN OF DARKNESS
GAINS 500 ATTACK POINTS

00:14:41.582 --> 00:14:44.520
FOR EVERY MONSTER
IN MY GRAVEYARD.

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:46.257
BUT WHY?

00:14:46.257 --> 00:14:49.697
I THOUGHT YOU DESPISED
HAVING MONSTERS
IN YOUR GRAVEYARD.

00:14:49.697 --> 00:14:52.369
BUT I DESPISE YOU
EVEN MORE,

00:14:52.369 --> 00:14:55.207
SO WHAT'S A FEW MONSTERS
IN THE GRAVE

00:14:55.207 --> 00:14:58.278
IF IT MEANS
DESTROYING YOU FOREVER?

00:14:58.278 --> 00:15:02.787
AND WITH ONLY
500 LIFE POINTS LEFT,
YOU WON'T LAST LONG.

00:15:02.787 --> 00:15:03.822
TRY ME.

00:15:03.822 --> 00:15:05.258
YOUR MOVE.

00:15:05.258 --> 00:15:08.196
YOU SOUND PRETTY ANXIOUS
TO LOSE YOUR SOUL.

00:15:08.196 --> 00:15:09.533
I'M NOT WORRIED.

00:15:09.533 --> 00:15:11.169
WELL, YOU SHOULD BE.

00:15:11.169 --> 00:15:16.779
NOW I'LL START BY
SWITCHING GUARDIAN DREADSCYTHE
INTO ATTACK MODE.

00:15:16.779 --> 00:15:19.785
THEN I'LL SACRIFICE
EVERY OTHER MONSTER I HAVE

00:15:19.785 --> 00:15:22.689
SO DREADSCYTHE CAN ABSORB
THEIR STRENGTH.

00:15:22.689 --> 00:15:23.958
DON'T DO IT.

00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:26.863
THE ORICHALCOS
IS CLOUDING YOUR MIND.

00:15:30.036 --> 00:15:35.045
RAFAEL, DON'T YOU
UNDERSTAND WHAT
YOU'VE JUST DONE?

00:15:35.045 --> 00:15:38.852
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT I'VE DONE.

00:15:38.852 --> 00:15:45.297
I'VE ADDED
2,000 ATTACK POINTS
TO MY GUARDIAN DREADSCYTHE.

00:15:45.297 --> 00:15:48.001
READ IT AND WEEP,
PHARAOH.

00:15:48.001 --> 00:15:49.572
D'YOU SEE THAT?

00:15:49.572 --> 00:15:52.677
NOW RAFAEL'S MONSTER
IS STRONGER.

00:15:52.677 --> 00:15:54.179
BYE, TIMAEUS.

00:15:54.179 --> 00:15:55.883
IT'S BEEN A BLAST.

00:15:55.883 --> 00:15:57.352
JUST GO.

00:15:57.352 --> 00:15:58.855
YOU GOT IT.

00:15:58.855 --> 00:16:01.159
GO, GUARDIAN DREADSCYTHE.

00:16:01.159 --> 00:16:03.697
RID THE FIELD
OF HIS DRAGON NOW.

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:21.460
YOU'VE GOT NO MONSTERS LEFT
TO PROTECT YOUR LIFE POINTS.

00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:22.795
HE'S RIGHT.

00:16:22.795 --> 00:16:24.298
WHAT'S HE GONNA DO?

00:16:24.298 --> 00:16:26.135
COME ON.

00:16:26.135 --> 00:16:28.473
ALL RIGHT, MY MOVE.

00:16:28.473 --> 00:16:30.042
CHECK IT OUT.

00:16:30.042 --> 00:16:32.279
THE PHARAOH'S
PRETTY CONFIDENT.

00:16:32.279 --> 00:16:34.884
Kaiba, voice-over:
HOW CAN HE WIN
WITHOUT THAT DRAGON?

00:16:34.884 --> 00:16:38.290
FIRST, I ACTIVATE
CARD OF SANCTITY.

00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:42.197
NOW WE BOTH DRAW
FROM OUR DECKS UNTIL
WE'RE HOLDING 6 CARDS.

00:16:46.371 --> 00:16:49.577
NOW THEN,
I SUMMON WATAPON
TO THE FIELD.

00:16:52.649 --> 00:16:54.887
NEXT I'LL SACRIFICE
WATAPON

00:16:54.887 --> 00:16:59.127
IN ORDER TO PLAY
MY DARK MAGICIAN GIRL
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:11.249
THEN I'LL PLAY THIS
AND END MY TURN.

00:17:11.249 --> 00:17:14.556
I THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME
I PUT YOU OUT OF YOUR MISERY,

00:17:14.556 --> 00:17:17.894
SO LET'S END THIS,
SHALL WE?

00:17:17.894 --> 00:17:20.800
AND I HAVE
THE PERFECT CARD TO DO IT--

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:23.004
OBEDIENCE!

00:17:23.004 --> 00:17:25.308
NOW, WHEN MY GUARDIAN ATTACKS,

00:17:25.308 --> 00:17:29.316
I CAN FORCE
YOUR DARK MAGICIAN GIRL TO
SWITCH INTO ATTACK MODE.

00:17:29.316 --> 00:17:33.089
SO WHEN SHE GOES,
SO DO THE REST
OF YOUR LIFE POINTS.

00:17:33.089 --> 00:17:35.760
DREADSCYTHE,
LET THE FUN BEGIN.

00:17:39.467 --> 00:17:41.203
NOW ATTACK.

00:17:41.203 --> 00:17:47.047
WIPE OUT HIS MAGICIAN
AND HIS LIFE POINTS.

00:17:47.047 --> 00:17:49.886
I ACTIVATE
MAGICAL PIGEON!

00:17:58.468 --> 00:18:00.070
WHAT?

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:01.674
ARE YOU CONFUSED?

00:18:01.674 --> 00:18:05.281
THIS MAGIC CARD
CAN ONLY BE USED ON
DARK MAGICIAN GIRL.

00:18:05.281 --> 00:18:06.983
IT PROTECTS HER
FROM AN ATTACK

00:18:06.983 --> 00:18:12.059
BY TRANSFORMING HER
INTO A PIGEON
FOR ONE TURN.

00:18:12.059 --> 00:18:13.628
YOU'RE JUST STALLING.

00:18:13.628 --> 00:18:16.901
I PLACE TWO CARDS FACE DOWN
AND END MY TURN.

00:18:21.476 --> 00:18:25.450
PHARAOH, CAN'T YOU SEE
THAT YOU'RE OUT OF OPTIONS?

00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:28.689
IT'S POINTLESS
TO DRAG THIS OUT.

00:18:28.689 --> 00:18:31.928
I'M WELL AWARE
THAT THE ODDS
ARE IN YOUR FAVOR,

00:18:31.928 --> 00:18:34.533
BUT THAT'S NO REASON
TO GIVE UP.

00:18:34.533 --> 00:18:38.073
RAFAEL, YOU MAY
HAVE THE MAGIC
OF THE ORICHALCOS,

00:18:38.073 --> 00:18:40.611
BUT I HAVE
SOMETHING STRONGER--

00:18:40.611 --> 00:18:44.017
A BELIEF IN
THE HEART OF THE CARDS
AND IN MYSELF.

00:18:44.017 --> 00:18:46.253
HOW SOON WE FORGET.

00:18:46.253 --> 00:18:48.825
YOU WERE ONCE RULED
BY DARKNESS.

00:18:48.825 --> 00:18:51.831
Yami-Yugi, voice-over:
YES, BUT I WAS ABLE
TO CONQUER IT.

00:18:51.831 --> 00:18:54.769
IT'S ABOUT TIME
YOU STARTED TAKING
SOME RESPONSIBILITY

00:18:54.769 --> 00:18:55.938
FOR WHAT
YOU'VE DONE.

00:18:55.938 --> 00:18:57.240
YOU NEED TO BE
A MAN FOR ONCE

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:59.144
AND FACE ME
IN A DUEL NOW.

00:18:59.144 --> 00:19:02.651
I ACTIVATE
THE TRAP CARD
DIVINE WIND.

00:19:02.651 --> 00:19:04.587
YOU PASSED THE TEST,
PAL.

00:19:04.587 --> 00:19:05.789
BY DEFEATING ME,

00:19:05.789 --> 00:19:07.492
YOU WERE ABLE TO
DEFEAT THE DARKNESS

00:19:07.492 --> 00:19:09.229
THAT WAS INSIDE
YOUR HEART.

00:19:09.229 --> 00:19:13.503
I MUST HELP RAFAEL
CONQUER THE DARKNESS
IN HIS HEART.

00:19:13.503 --> 00:19:16.842
THIS DUEL'S
FAR FROM OVER, RAFAEL.

00:19:16.842 --> 00:19:18.011
Yami-Yugi, voice-over:
EXCELLENT.

00:19:18.011 --> 00:19:21.083
NOW I CAN DO FOR HIM
WHAT YUGI DID FOR ME.

00:19:21.083 --> 00:19:24.956
I KNOW FIRST-HAND
WHAT THE ORICHALCOS DOES
TO A PERSON'S HEART

00:19:24.956 --> 00:19:26.860
AND I CAN HELP YOU.

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:30.333
THINK, WHEN EATOS
WAS DESTROYED

00:19:30.333 --> 00:19:33.405
YOU UNLEASHED YOUR ANGER
ON YOUR OTHER MONSTERS.

00:19:33.405 --> 00:19:38.114
YOU LET THE ORICHALCOS
FEED ON YOUR RAGE
LIKE I DID.

00:19:38.114 --> 00:19:41.187
SO? WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

00:19:41.187 --> 00:19:44.025
THAT THIS ISN'T
WHO YOU REALLY ARE.

00:19:44.025 --> 00:19:47.030
THE DARKNESS WITHIN YOU
HAS TAKEN CONTROL,

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:50.470
AND NOW YOU MUST FACE
THAT DARKNESS HEAD ON.

00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:51.872
IT'S THE ONLY WAY

00:19:51.872 --> 00:19:55.312
FOR YOU
TO SAVE YOURSELF.

00:19:55.312 --> 00:19:56.881
YOU NEED TO BE SAVED.

00:19:56.881 --> 00:19:59.052
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE
MY WORDS,

00:19:59.052 --> 00:20:01.656
THEN MAYBE THIS
WILL CONVINCE YOU.

00:20:01.656 --> 00:20:03.761
WHAT ARE YOU HOLDING?

00:20:03.761 --> 00:20:07.133
A CARD THAT FORCES YOU
TO TAKE A CLOSER
LOOK AT YOURSELF--

00:20:07.133 --> 00:20:08.803
UNDERWORLD CIRCLE!

00:20:08.803 --> 00:20:10.639
WHAT ON EARTH DOES THAT DO?

00:20:10.639 --> 00:20:11.875
BEHOLD!

00:20:11.875 --> 00:20:13.879
IT'S TIME TO TAKE
SOME RESPONSIBILITY

00:20:13.879 --> 00:20:16.383
FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE,
RAFAEL!

00:20:16.383 --> 00:20:22.126
UNDERWORLD CIRCLE,
ACTIVATE.

00:20:22.126 --> 00:20:23.830
MY MONSTER'S GONE.

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:26.067
YES, AND SO IS MINE.

00:20:26.067 --> 00:20:29.941
NOW WITNESS
YOUR TRUE DARKNESS.

00:20:36.719 --> 00:20:38.255
I DON'T LIKE
THE LOOKS 'A THAT.

00:20:38.255 --> 00:20:39.491
DITTO.

00:20:39.491 --> 00:20:42.797
WE CAN'T EVEN SEE
WHAT'S GOING ON NOW.

00:20:42.797 --> 00:20:45.171
LET'S JUST HOPE
WHEN THE SMOKE CLEARS,

00:20:45.171 --> 00:20:47.073
IT'S THE PHARAOH
THAT'S STANDING.
