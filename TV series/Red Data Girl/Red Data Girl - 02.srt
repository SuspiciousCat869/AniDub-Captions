[HARUNA] So do you and Sagara
sleep in the same room

4
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:08,958
now that he's
staying at the shrine?

Of course not...!

00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:12,000
His room is out in the lodge...

00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:13,791
We do eat together, though.

[AYUMI] Why don't
you ask him out?

13
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:25,291
[HARUNA] I'd have
too many rivals.

14

Surely he'll try out for

Y'know...?

his ride pick him
up a little later

00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:26,000
Because I can't handle
being somewhere so crowded...

95
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:27,416
I couldn't even
go to Career Day.

thinking about it.

What do you expect
me to do about it...?

This is
confidential stuff...

100

She explicitly
said not to tell

anyone from school.

102
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:38,916
It's a weird request...

103
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,458
but I don't see how you
can refuse to do it.

104
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:44,166
She told me to contact
her using this...

105

[MIYUKI] Why not?

108
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:50,833
The phone will break.

109
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,000
[MIYUKI] What?

110
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,750
Computers and cell phones
all go haywire

whenever I touch them...

112
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:58,125
but there's no turning back
if I break this one.

113
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,500
You're actually being
serious about this,

aren't you...?

115
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,000
Are you telling me
you lived your entire

life unable to
use a computer

117
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,375
or a phone?

118
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:08,458
[IZUMIKO] I have
used a phone...!

119
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:09,750
Just not a cell...

120
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:10,791
Ah, man, it's
like you're

Stone Age.

[IZUMIKO] Sagara, please...

123
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,750
I want you to take
this cell phone and

124
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,250
go see my mother for me.

125
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:18,666
[MIYUKI] You want me to what?

126
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,375
This may be the only
chance we get.

127
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:22,166
We can't waste it...

128
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,708
and besides...

129
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:27,250
You'd probably be better at
winning her over than I would.

130
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:28,875
Oh, come on...

131
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:32,375
Why are you trying to dump all
of this onto my shoulders?

132
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,208
Isn't she going out of
her way to arrange this

133
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:36,583
because she wants to see you...?

134
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:40,125
What if I went by myself
and she didn't show?

135
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:41,833
So then maybe
I do have to go...

136
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:45,000
but will you please
come with me?

137
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:47,333
Since this is obviously
so important to you,

138
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,375
I'm willing to do what I can.

139
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:51,583
All right.

140
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:53,083
Then so am I.

141
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:02,333
Huh...?

142
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:04,541
Wamiya?

143
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,125
He said he wasn't coming.

144
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:09,625
He isn't really the
type of person who goes

145
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:11,083
on fieldtrips and stuff.

146
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:14,125
Now that I think of it he's
kind of like you, I guess.

147
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:15,791
I didn't realize that.

148
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:02,250
Ya want any?

149
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:03,625
Hey, what's the matter?

150
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:05,000
You airsick?

151
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,750
It's behind me...

152
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:13,208
[AYUMI] Is there
something in the back?

153

It's nothing...

00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,458
I'll be okay.

155
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:39,708
[HARUNA] You okay...?

156
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:40,833
You look pale.

157

[IZUMIKO] Haruna...

158
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:44,125
would you mind
getting my luggage?

159
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:46,458
[HARUNA] No problem, but
you don't look so good.

160
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,666
I'll see if I can
find you some medicine.

161
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,791
[MIYUKI] Hey.

162
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:59,250
Are you really sick
or are you just faking...?

163
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:02,083
We aren't due to meet up with
your mom for a while yet.

00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,000
I'll be okay.

165
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:04,333
Did you send her a text?

166
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:05,208
[MIYUKI] Yeah...

167
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:06,833
She already sent a response...

168
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:08,375
Here, look.

169
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:11,208
3:30 at the northern
observatory...

170
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:12,666
But do you think
you'll actually make it?

171
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,750
You do look pretty pale.

172
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:15,583
[IZUMIKO] No...

173
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:17,166
I'm going.

174
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,500
I think I'll be okay, really,

175
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:22,416
I just need to adjust
to them, that's all.

176
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,041
[MIYUKI] The crowds here
in the big, bad city

177
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:25,666
are making you feel sick...?

178
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,250
Is that what this is about?

179
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,291
Don't make it sound
like I'm being a baby...

180
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:31,000
There are so many
weird things here.

181
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:32,208
They scare me.

182
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:34,416
What "weird things"
are you talking about?

183
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,083
Bad things that
follow me wherever I go...

184
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:38,958
They look like smoky shadows...

185
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:41,666
Sinister black figures.

186
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,958
If those things
actually do exist,

187
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,250
You can ask Yukariko
how to deal with them.

188
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:53,166
[NAKAMURA] Okay...!

189
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,875
I'm giving you
some free time now.

190
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:56,541
Meet back here at four...

191
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:59,416
and don't leave the Metropolitan
Government Office Building...

192
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,291
Everyone got that?

193
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:01,791
[STUDENTS] Yes!

194
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:02,833
Hey, do you
feel up to

195
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:05,208
visiting the
observatory?

196
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:06,583
I think so.

197
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:27,416
That one goes to the
southern observatory.

198
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,416
I knew you were going
to screw this up.

199
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,250
She specifically
said the northern one.

200
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:45,541
Well, it's already
half past three.

201
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:48,083
So you're terrified
of strangers.

202
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:49,458
Is that what this is?

203
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:51,125
You think anyone you
don't know is a threat.

204
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:53,250
They're all out to get you.

205
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:56,041
I don't think
everybody is that way.

206
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,291
But...

207
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:59,583
I was telling the truth
about the black figures.

[phone vibrates]

209

It's no good...

210
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,708
It looks like she
can't make it, after all.

211
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:06,791
[IZUMIKO] She can't...?!

212
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,083
Why not?

213
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:10,250
[MIYUKI] "Leave the
observatory immediately...

214

They've already found you."...?

215
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:14,500
Who's found us?

216
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,458
[IZUMIKO]
The creatures I mentioned.

217
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:18,750
They might be
after Mother, as well.

218
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,833
[MIYUKI] Yeah, right!

219
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:22,041
Come on!

220
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,125
We need to get out of
here, like she said!

221
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:25,166
[phone vibrating]

222
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,083
She wants us to go
to her house...?!

223
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:34,708
No way!

224
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:36,458
I can't go there!

225
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:40,125
Okay, I pulled up
the address she gave us.

226
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,375
It's not too far from here.

227
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:42,250
Are you serious?

228
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:43,291
No, we can't!

229
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,000
You want to see
her, don't you...?

230
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:46,500
We've come this far.

[MIYUKI] What the hell
is going on here...?

It's almost like someone is
trying to stop us from leaving!

They may have
found us already.

Who exactly is this
"they" you keep talking about?!

I wouldn't be so scared
if I knew the answer.

But I feel someone...

248
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:43,916
and he's getting closer!

[MIYUKI] Let's get off...

If we don't do something
about those braids,

us off at the wrong place.

[IZUMIKO] What?

261

[MIYUKI] We're just a couple
of blocks off, though.

We can probably walk
there in ten minutes.

It's not
the lightning.

that there might be

if you think it would

make you feel better, I could
chant a mantra for you.

325
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:50,708
Sagara, it's you!

326
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,791
But what are
you doing he--

327
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:54,208
[MIYUKI] Hold on...!

328
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:55,791
Stay right there...!

329
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:58,208
Not one step further until you
prove you're the real Yukimasa.

330
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:00,333
You're starting to make
a fool of yourself...

331
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:01,625
Just look...

332
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:04,708
Izumiko clearly recognizes
I am who I say I am.

333
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,083
But just a
second ago you

334
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:07,125
were terrified
of him!

335
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:08,750
You wanna explain
that to me?

336
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:09,875
Yeah, I know...

337
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:12,583
I was scared, but this
really is Sagara...

338
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:15,333
I guess I was imagining
things, like you said.

339
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:16,541
The whole time
I was frightened

340
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:17,500
for no good reason.

341
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:19,083
Don't give me
that crap!

342
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:21,500
[YUKIMASA] Actually, the fact
she was afraid of me is proof

343
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,500
that I am who I claim to be.

344
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,708
I really, truly
felt something...

345
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:27,708
I don't know what,
exactly, but...

346
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:30,500
I could sense something
bad approaching.

347
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,291
[YUKIMASA] I don't
doubt that you did...

348
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:35,416
You probably sensed someone
other than just me.

349
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,541
There is any number of people
in the world who would like

350
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,375
to make you theirs.

351
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:40,833
[MIYUKI] Okay...

352
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:42,916
but we kept being blocked
from getting to Yukariko...

353
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,625
Were you the one behind that?

354
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:47,041
No, none of that
was my doing...

355
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:49,166
Just so you know, you won't
see her even if you do

356
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,375
go to her house.

357
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:53,208
She gave up on your
meeting when she was unable

358
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:56,291
to reach the
northern observatory.

359
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,458
Even so...

360
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:59,083
the house has a
barrier around it,

361
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,791
which makes it an
ideal place to rest.

362
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:03,083
[IZUMIKO sneezes]

363
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:08,625
[IZUMIKO] Mother
really isn't here...

364
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:09,875
Is she?

365
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:11,708
[YUKIMASA] You mustn't
hold it against her...

366
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:14,541
She thought it would be best if
she acted as a decoy to draw

367
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:16,791
their attention away from you.

368
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:18,625
I guess I should
be used to it by now.

369
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:21,958
Mother's job in public security
always keeps her busy.

370
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:24,000
Taking that job
was wise on her part...

371
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,125
Though Yukariko's aptitude
is also some of what

372
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:27,708
keeps her busy...

373
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:30,333
Now, Izumiko, go upstairs and
look for a change of clothes...

374
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:32,416
And feel free to rest
for a little bit...

375
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,625
You look like you're about
to fall asleep standing up.

376
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:50,750
[YUKIMASA] Don't go
taking your pants off.

377
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:53,250
Keep in mind, this is
somebody else's home.

378
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:54,666
Where would I be
without you here

379
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,583
to point out the obvious?

380
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:59,166
[YUKIMASA] You're always
so angry when I see you.

381
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,500
Have you ever thought
we might try to have

382
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:03,416
a polite conversation
when we're alone?

383
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,958
[MIYUKI] It just pisses me off
how you're always so damn smug.

384
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:09,625
You might've fooled Suzuhara
but you can't fool me...

385
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:11,250
I know what
you're really like...

386
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:12,583
And don't forget it.

387
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:15,208
What are you
talking about now?

388
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:16,833
[MIYUKI] I saw it
with my own eyes:

389
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:19,375
Suzuhara was literally
shaking with fear...

390
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,333
She went back to normal
the second you showed up,

391
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:23,125
but only because of a spell...

392
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:25,375
I know what you did:
you exorcised her!

393
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:26,583
[YUKIMASA] So what?

394
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,250
I bet you're the reason
Yukariko decided not

395
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,291
to show up today.

396
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:31,166
I bet she could
sense your presence!

397
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,041
Yes, well, that
was inevitable...

398
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:34,750
You may not know
this yet, but it's

399
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:36,416
in their nature to run.

400
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,000
Like I told Izumiko earlier,

401
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:40,083
there is an endless list
of people who want to use

402
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:42,750
her powers for their
own personal gain.

403
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:43,625
Businessmen...

404
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:44,875
politicians...

405
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:45,708
academics...

406
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,250
men of religion...

407
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:48,750
even us Mountain Monks.

408
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,375
What type of power
does she have that would

409
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:52,250
attract so much interest?

410
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:53,750
[YUKIMASA] Don't you see...?

411
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:55,916
All that interest is
proof of its rarity...

412
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,416
Fewer and fewer people are
born with the pure power

413
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,791
that Mountain Monks train
all their lives to obtain.

414
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:05,083
This power has been given only
to women since ancient times.

415
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:07,916
A power given only to women?

416
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,291
I don't get it...

417
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,541
She certainly doesn't
seem all that impressive...

418
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:15,041
She's just a big scaredy cat who
can't do anything on her own.

419
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:16,166
[YUKIMASA] True...

420
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,958
I can't say that
she's fully awoken yet.

421
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:20,666
I'm sick of
this crap...

422
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,916
If you really want to
protect Suzuhara so badly,

423
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,583
do it yourself.

424
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:26,083
There is no way
in hell I'm going to work

425
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:27,625
as your lackey...!

426
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:30,416
If I have to, I'll find a way
to see Yukariko myself and--

427
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,000
[MIYUKI] Suzuhara...?

428
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:42,625
You should have warned us
you were coming down.

429
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,166
Suzuhara...?

430
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,500
[YUKIMASA] Get away from her.

431
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:57,125
Now...!

432
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:58,583
You're not dressed to stand in
the presence of Her Highness...

433
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:00,583
Get back!

434
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:02,291
[HIME-GAMI] Oh...

435
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:04,125
Yukimasa...

436
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:05,750
You are here, too?

437
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:07,583
I apologize for
welcoming you in such

438
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:08,875
an unseemly manner...

439
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:11,166
I had not yet made
arrangements to receive you.

440
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,083
Please, forgive me.

441
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:14,750
[HIME-GAMI] All is well...

442
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:19,916
I am the one who arrived
without announcing my intent.

443
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,541
This is my first time
descending into Izumiko.

444
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:27,208
I have not yet
adjusted to this body...

445
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:30,875
It is rather unpleasant, as it
is still too young for me...

446
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,708
Despite that...

447
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:37,625
[HIME-GAMI] I have come...

448
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:40,791
because I sensed something
monumental taking wing.

449
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:43,916
[YUKIMASA] Highness.

450
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,041
Will you stay with
Izumiko henceforth?

451
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:49,166
[HIME-GAMI] Let us
not be hasty...

452
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:52,208
It is not as though
you have caught me yet...

453
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:53,708
Regardless...

454
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:57,250
I would advise you to take
good care of Izumiko's body...

455
00:21:57,333 --> 00:22:00,916
You must look after it well.

456
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,916
This child will likely
serve as my last vessel.

457
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,875
It will come to a
close as soon as that?

458
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:09,583
[HIME-GAMI] It may...

459
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:13,166
I doubt I will go
beyond this generation.

460
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:20,416
Princess!

461
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:26,666
[IZUMIKO] What?!

462
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,666
W-w-why am I wearing this...?

463
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:29,166
I'm...

464
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,625
I...

465
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:31,125
Hush.

466
00:22:31,208 --> 00:22:32,625
Calm down.

467
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:34,833
You don't have to
remember everything now...

468
00:22:34,916 --> 00:22:37,833
It will come back to you
gradually over time.

469
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:39,000
Uh, I...

470
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:40,541
Have to go.

471
00:22:45,291 --> 00:22:47,125
So you're telling me she's
from a line of women who

472
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:49,041
are susceptible to possession?

473
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:50,416
I thought
I was prepared.

474
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,083
I had already
assumed that Izumiko

475
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:53,458
was a very
special child...

476
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:55,416
but I never
considered this.

477
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,208
[MIYUKI] What are
you talking about?

478
00:22:57,291 --> 00:22:58,583
You were right...

479
00:22:58,666 --> 00:23:01,458
Just as you said, protecting
Izumiko will go far beyond

480
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:03,083
what you are capable of.

481
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:05,125
If that's the case, then--

482
