00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:30,166
[explosion]

2
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:37,833
[STUDENTS freaking out]

3
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:44,958
What do you think
just happened?

4
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:48,291
[MAYURA] Masumi...

5
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:50,125
he left me...

6
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:51,208
What's going on...?

7
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:52,958
Is it Manatsu?

8
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,500
The battery's dead...?

9
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:57,500
No way!

10
00:00:57,583 --> 00:00:58,708
[MIYUKI] same here!

11
00:00:58,791 --> 00:00:59,791
[BOY STUDENT 1] I wonder
what's up with this.

12
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:01,166
[GIRL STUDENT 1]
Why isn't it working?

13
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,583
[BOY STUDENT 2] Maybe
there's radio interference?

14
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:04,416
[BOY STUDENT 3] Man, my
camera won't turn on, either.

15
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,166
[HOSHINO] Oh, crap!

16
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,458
Where's Kisaragi now?

17
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:08,000
[SHIBATA] I think she's
at the riding grounds.

18
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:09,166
[MIYUKI] I'm going on patrol.

19
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,708
I'll start there.

20
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:17,583
Computers and cell
phones all go haywire

21
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:19,166
whenever I touch them...

22
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:21,750
[NONOMURA] Miyuki!

23
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,708
Nonomura, hey!

24
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:27,916
Do you think all this
might have something to do

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,041
with Suzuhara?

26
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:30,958
I only wish I could
say for certain...

27
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:33,625
I knew beforehand something
was going to happen today.

28
00:01:33,708 --> 00:01:35,166
But the consequences...?

29
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,916
It has to be connected
to the Hime-gami, doesn't it?

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,291
Izumiko will
awaken today...

31
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:43,000
So says the prophecy
about this festival.

32
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:45,625
The prophecy...

33
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:48,458
So the Hime-gami said that
while possessing Yukariko?

34
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:49,666
[NONOMURA] That's right.

35
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,541
You should
take this with you.

36
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:59,125
Thank you, I will.

37
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:03,875
[MANATSU] Shinkou!

38
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:04,708
What's going on?

39
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:05,583
What was that...?

40
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:06,875
Was it Takayanagi?

41
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:08,083
Hold on one second...

42
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:09,125
You aren't Masumi...

43
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:10,625
are you?

44
00:02:10,708 --> 00:02:12,375
No, Masumi
isn't here.

45
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:14,833
Suzuhara is with
Takayanagi...

46
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:16,833
I'm headed to the riding
grounds, where they are...

47
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:18,416
I want to know what's happening.

48
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,500
I'll come, too...

49
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:21,083
I'm worried about
the horses.

50
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:33,708
[OKOCHI] What the heck...?

51
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:35,541
What am I supposed to do now?

52
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,750
[MIYUKI] That's weird.

53
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:41,458
[MANATSU] An Onmyouji spell?

54
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:45,208
[MIYUKI and MANATSU]
Shelter me!

55
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:47,083
Cloak me in protective armor!

56
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:52,833
[GIRL 1] What the--?

57
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:54,375
[BOY 1] Hey...

58
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:00,791
[MIYUKI] What are
you two doing here?

59
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:03,625
Where did Suzuhara go...?

60
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:05,458
Where did
Takayanagi take her...?

61
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:06,875
Tell me!

62
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:09,958
And where in the world
did this dog come from?

63
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:12,500
[TAKAYANAGI] Watch your tone!

64
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:14,166
Wait, that voice...

65
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,750
You're Takayanagi!

66
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:17,000
[TAKAYANAGI] Of course I am...!

67
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:19,791
And I will not be referred
to as a lowly cur!

68
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:21,166
She is gone...

69
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:24,291
Suzuhara simply vanished and
entered another plane...

70
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:25,291
And look!

71
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:27,333
Look what she did
to Takayanagi!

72
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,958
So these are like
the planes in Togakushi?

73
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:32,541
As far as I can
tell, yes...

74
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:35,250
But we can't pass through
them without Masumi.

75
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:39,291
[MIYUKI]
Wamiya...!

76
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:41,333
Guide me to the place
where Suzuhara is!

77
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:48,833
[WAMIYA] I can take you into
the other land to find her.

78
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:50,166
But I think you should know...

79
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,250
she has absolutely
no desire to come back...

80
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:56,250
and there is a powerful
foe lying in wait for you.

81
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:56,750
[MIYUKI] Who?

82
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:58,250
What foe...?

83
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:00,416
and why are you making it
sound like I've already lost?

84
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,791
Because Masumi is there...

85
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,375
He's waiting on the other side.

86
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:05,041
Wait, what are
you saying?

87
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:06,125
[MANATSU] I...

88
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:07,625
I thought out of
all of us, Masumi was

89
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:09,583
the most unchangeable.

90
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,750
Turns out I was wrong...

91
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:14,041
He managed to find someone.

92
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:17,000
Someone he can love
besides his siblings...

93
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:18,333
Izumiko!

94
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,250
[IZUMIKO] Through all that...

95
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:42,416
I didn't switch places
with the Hime-gami.

96
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,416
Despite everything
that happened...

97
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,708
she wasn't the one
who saved me...

98
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:49,416
I saved myself.

99
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,166
Does that mean that
I've been her all along...?

100
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,833
Was I fooling myself
this whole time...

101
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:57,208
thinking we were
separate entities?

102
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,625
I can't take it...

103
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:03,750
I don't want anyone
to see me like this.

104
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:07,666
I have to stay here,
in this plane.

105
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,708
Then everyone will be okay...

106
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:11,083
I'll never leave...

107
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:13,625
If I don't, maybe I can
escape playing a role

108
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:16,916
in the destruction of humanity.

109
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,791
I wish I'd never even
seen Houjou Academy.

110
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:22,125
[rustling]

111
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:22,791
Who's there...?!

112
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,291
Stay away from me!

113
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:26,500
[MASUMI] And why should I?

114
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:28,458
Oh, it's just you, Masumi.

115
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,500
[MASUMI] You guessed it.

116
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:32,958
[IZUMIKO] Is it a good
idea to leave Mayura...?

117
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,000
Don't you need to be
there helping her win?

118
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:36,708
Yeah, I'm supposed
to be...

119
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:39,583
Only, I'm having a hard
time understanding her...

120
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:41,625
She doesn't mind
sacrificing herself,

121
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,166
and I don't
really get that.

122
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,583
What d'you mean?

123
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:47,125
Ultimately, Mayura has
decided to throw herself away

124
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:51,500
and donate her heart to Manatsu
so she can become one with him.

125
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:52,958
She wouldn't...!

126
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:55,291
[MASUMI] A long time ago,
the three of us made a pact

127
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:57,541
to eventually merge
our identities...

128
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:58,875
but now...

129
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,125
some dissonance is growing
between the other two.

130
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:02,666
[IZUMIKO] In what way?

131
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,708
[MASUMI] They are separately
trying to find an alternative

132
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:06,416
to becoming one
with each other...

133
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,666
but they each hold the other's
survival above their own.

134
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:12,125
[IZUMIKO] I'm a
little jealous...

135
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:14,458
I'm not like them, am I?

136
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,541
No...

137
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,625
I wanted to help
Mayura defeat Takayanagi

138
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,916
in this last battle...

139
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,875
but...

140
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,458
that won't happen.

141
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:23,791
Yeah, why not?

142
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:25,041
[IZUMIKO] Because...

143
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:27,583
I can't go back
to the academy...

144
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:30,250
Apparently I'm
not actually human.

145
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:31,083
Oh, come on.

146
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:32,791
Of course
you're human!

147
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,250
If that is the case...

148
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,708
then what am I
doing here with you?

149
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:38,375
The thing about
divine spirits is,

150
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:40,875
we reside on higher
waves than humans do...

151
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:43,208
I promise, Suzuhara,
you are human.

152
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:44,416
You were just born

153
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,166
with the ability to
heighten your waves...

154
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,333
There used to be a bunch
of people with that a bility

155
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:52,208
a long time ago, but you're
an endangered species now.

156
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:54,375
In fact, your unique
power is what makes you

157
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:56,750
utterly irresistible to me...

158
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,125
You see...

159
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:01,208
What I'm trying to say
is that I love you, Izumiko.

160
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:03,416
[IZUMIKO gasps]

161
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,000
[WAMIYA] Not good.

162
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:07,250
It seems that she's thinking
about staying there permanently.

163
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:08,916
So what, you won't
take me now?

164
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,250
[WAMIYA] As long as you realize
it could be a one-way ticket.

165
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:12,541
Hey, this
isn't a joke!

166
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:14,375
[WAMIYA] You don't
stand much of a chance...

167
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:15,708
Do you still want to try?

168
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:16,916
Yes, you know
I do...!

169
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,750
Now let's go!

170
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:19,000
[MANATSU] Wait, Shinkou!

171
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,583
I'm going to go
with you...!

172
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:23,416
Suzuhara came to get me out when
I was trapped in Togakushi...

173
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,125
It's my turn to
go after her.

174
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:26,333
No, forget it...

175
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:28,041
You need to stay
right here and help Souda...

176
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:29,875
Do you have any idea
what it would do to her

177
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:31,000
if she lost both of you?

178
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:32,000
But Masumi's
my respo--

179
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,541
[MIYUKI]
You are coming.

180
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:36,000
You need to
apologize to Suzuhara...

181
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:38,375
and ask her to
turn you back to normal.

182
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,958
[TAKAYANAGI] It does seem she
and I need to have a chat.

183
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:41,958
[MIYUKI] Come on, Wamiya...

184
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:43,750
Show us the way.

185
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,375
[WAMIYA] As you wish.

186
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:00,000
Here I am with
a bird and a dog...

187
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:02,416
Add a donkey and a cat
and we could head to Bremen.

188
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,958
[TAKAYANAGI] The bird
was a rooster...!

189
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:06,291
And I'm not a dog, thank you!

190
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:08,083
Well, which way
am I supposed to go?

191
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:10,083
[WAMIYA] Directions have
little meaning here...

192
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:11,625
So go wherever you like.

193
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:19,458
[TAKAYANAGI] Now that I
think about it, Suzuhara was

194
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:23,083
very upset about how I used
animals to create shikigami...

195
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:26,083
Could this be her
form of retaliation?

196
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:28,583
[MIYUKI] You're just
now figuring that out?

197
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:30,708
[TAKAYANAGI] Do you think we can
expect the layout of this realm

198
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:32,958
to be similar to
the academy grounds?

199
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:34,000
[MIYUKI] It would make
sense if there were

200
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:36,791
some overlap between the two.

201
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:38,500
[TAKAYANAGI] In that case...

202
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:40,291
those shapes in the distance...

203
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:43,000
They're most likely the
ghosts of Hachiouji, right?

204
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:50,708
[MIYUKI] Wamiya,
are you there...?

205
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:52,958
You don't expect us to
get past them, do you?

206
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,916
[WAMIYA] If you want to
continue on this futile quest,

207
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,166
you'll have to...

208
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,416
If it helps...

209
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,958
the ghosts will vanish
if you can get past them

210
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:01,291
and cross over the rift.

211
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,416
Is this
Masumi's spell?

212
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,166
Stick close to me if you can...

213
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,666
If you can't, then run like
your life depends on it.

214
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:09,333
Rin...

215
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:09,916
byou...

216
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,416
tou...

217
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:10,875
sha...

218
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:11,375
kai...

219
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:11,916
jin...

220
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,375
retsu...

221
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:12,916
zai...

222
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,958
zen.

223
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:26,791
Protect me
and purify me.

224
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,250
Guide me and deliver me.

225
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,666
Cloak me in
protective armor!

226
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,500
[TAKAYANGI] The ghosts
borrow people's mental energy

227
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,916
in order to take form...

228
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,625
They shouldn't be able
to do much harm to one

229
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,208
with a strong mind.

230
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,500
Shelter me now
and give me strength.

231
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:08,458
[WAMIYA] This isn't the
only rift to cross.

232
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:09,833
[MIYUKI] There are more?!

233
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:12,250
[WAMIYA] Your task will only
become more difficult...

234
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:14,208
not easier.

235
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:17,125
The issue is the power with
which you cross the rifts.

236
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:19,875
If you attempt to cross them
with insufficient power...

237
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:22,750
you will keep returning
to this area.

238
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:25,166
[MIYUKI] And what if we aren't
able to reach Suzuhara...?

239
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,833
What will happen?

240
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:27,958
[WAMIYA] That's simple...

241
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:30,458
You can just pull back.

242
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,666
You can give up
at any time.

243
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,250
You'll be free if you do...

244
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,791
Your pain will stop.

245
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:43,791
[MAYURA] It'll be okay...

246
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:45,250
Take deep breaths.

247
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:46,250
[MANATSU] Mayura!

248
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:47,375
[MAYURA] Manatsu?!

249
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:49,875
You're all right!

250
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:50,875
I was so worried!

251
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:51,625
Sorry...

252
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:52,958
I had to go
with Sagara.

253
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:53,500
Why?

254
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:54,666
What happened?

255
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,083
It looks like Suzuhara
and Masumi crossed

256
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:57,875
into another plane.

257
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,625
But why would
they do that?

258
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,833
[MANATSU] He's fallen
in love with her...

259
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,500
with Izumiko.

260
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:05,041
So Masumi-...

261
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:07,541
He isn't going
to be coming back?

262
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,625
[MANATSU] I don't know.

263
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:09,916
[MAYURA] He has to...

264
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,875
He promised he'd
spend the day with me.

265
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,916
I...

266
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,083
I just hate the thought
of him leaving me...

267
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,416
and I hate the thought
of losing you...

268
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,208
We haven't even settled
things with Takayanagi!

269
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,125
It's time to stop
fighting for the top spot...

270
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:30,458
It isn't right, the way
we've been using Masumi.

271
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:32,250
There will
be victims...

272
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:36,291
And Suzuhara might
be one of them!

273
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:38,541
So, you don't like me?

274
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,416
I-it's not
like that, really...

275
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,791
It's just, we don't
know each other very well.

276
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:44,125
[MASUMI] There is
a part of me that knows

277
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,375
you much better
than you think...

278
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:50,041
[IZUMIKO] To Masumi, love means
something very different.

279
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:51,166
[MASUMI] They
can't stay like this.

280
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,416
They're suffering.

281
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,041
They would be better off
if I consumed them...

282
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:57,250
That would count as
a type of love, right?

283
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,458
[MASUMI] I could bring so
much fun into your life...

284
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:00,166
Please!

285
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,166
Just let me show you!

286
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,500
I don't think...

287
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:06,166
I'll ever be able
to have fun again...

288
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,500
Everything has changed somehow.

289
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:20,916
[IZUMIKO] Is this...?

290
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,250
Ujitero Hojo's wife,
Ohisa, was still standing

291
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,333
until the castle fell.

292
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:26,500
But even so...

293
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:29,083
she was never reunited
with her husband.

294
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:32,041
There will never be such
an unhappy ending for you!

295
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:34,416
[FEMALE GHOST 1] Oh, Milady!

296
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,333
It's wonderful to see that
the lord has returned to you!

297
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:38,791
[FEMALE GHOST 2] We have
prepared a small celebration

298
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,041
in your honor.

299
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:43,166
Everyone here has
been so worried about you.

300
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,500
The palace is waiting...

301
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:45,458
Shall we go?

302
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:46,208
[IZUMIKO] Um...

303
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:47,041
sure.

304
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:48,000
[MASUMI] Come on!

305
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:15,625
[TAKAYANAGI] Your costume
is falling apart...

306
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,458
Is that significant...?

307
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:20,333
Are all of these attacks
actually hurting you?

308
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:20,958
No!

309
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,541
I'll be all right.

310
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:24,458
[MIYUKI] This place
doesn't actually exist,

311
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:26,500
so these injuries aren't real...

312
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:30,583
If I start to believe I've been
hurt, it will become true.

313
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:32,708
The fact I'm already
suffering means I don't fully

314
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:35,708
believe this isn't real.

315
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:37,041
But...

316
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,750
does that mean I don't
fully believe in Suzuhara?

317
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:42,083
[TAKAYANAGI] I'm truly
impressed with you, Sagara...

318
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:42,791
I mean it.

319
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:44,750
I sincerely admire you.

320
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:46,625
For how hard you're trying...

321
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:48,416
to bring me to Suzuhara...

322
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,916
so she can make things right.

323
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,083
[MIYUKI] Same to you.

324
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:52,958
I'm truly impressed
with your arrogance.

325
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,708
[TAKAYANAGI] You spoke of
the power needed to cross

326
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:04,708
the rifts...

327
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:07,541
What power did
you mean, exactly?

328
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:10,208
[WAMIYA] The power of your
belief in what you are doing.

329
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:13,000
Your belief in what
the future may hold.

330
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:15,791
[MIYUKI] Suzuhara!

331
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:18,166
Will you bear the weight of the
Hime-gami's burden alone...?

332
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,333
What happened to wanting
to be a normal girl?

333
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,958
Have you thought about
what I proposed earlier?

334
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:35,208
Souda, I can tell
we're a lot alike...

335
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,500
I can see the benefit of
pretending to be your fiancée...

336
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:39,958
Even so...

337
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:42,416
I don't think it's
something we should do.

338
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,958
But why not?

339
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:46,041
[MIYUKI] I understand
that you mean well...

340
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:47,833
and I'm certain it
would be effective...

341
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:49,750
Unfortunately, it would
also harm the people

342
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:52,583
we care most about.

343
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:53,875
[MAYURA] Okay, then...

344
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,541
so what now?

345
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:56,875
Hopefully...

346
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,833
I'll be able to discover
a path for her that nobody

347
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:00,958
has thought of before.

348
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:02,458
[MAYURA] Wait a second...

349
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:05,333
when you say that, are you
talking about Izumiko?

350
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:25,875
[WAMIYA] The power of your
belief in what you are doing.

351
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:29,333
Your belief in what
the future may hold.

352
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:31,166
[MIYUKI yelling] Izumiko...!

353
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,916
You have to know
that I'm here for you!

354
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:38,791
Is something
the matter?

355
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:41,375
[IZUMIKO] I think I just
heard someone call my name.

356
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:43,125
I didn't
hear anything.

357
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:48,083
[MASUMI] A cell phone
isn't going to work here.

358
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:50,125
[MIYUKI] but if you run
into trouble out there ...

359
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:53,208
don't try to handle it
all on your own, okay?

360
00:15:53,291 --> 00:16:00,916
[phone rings]

361
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,541
Hello?

362
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:02,083
[MIYUKI] Suzuhara!

363
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:03,125
Where are you?

364
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:06,166
[IZUMIKO] Miyuki...!

365
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,083
Where are you?

366
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:07,875
[MIYUKI] Say, "Come to me!"...

367
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:09,375
and I will!

368
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:10,083
[IZUMIKO] But...

369
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:10,958
this is...

370
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:12,166
[MIYUKI] Just hurry and say it!

371
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,833
[IZUMIKO] Come to me, Miyuki...!

372
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:18,791
I-I-I... I need you!

373
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:21,458
[phone hangs up]

374
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:31,875
[WAMIYA] You finally called...

375
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,208
so I came to you...

376
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:35,875
but did you really
have to wait so long?

377
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:37,458
Wamiya?

378
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:39,541
[WAMIYA] My gain is your loss...

379
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:42,791
Suzuhara will never belong
to Togakushi or you...

380
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:45,458
Keep trying and you'll
just waste your time.

381
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:47,166
I knew he was here...!

382
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,583
You brought Shinkou...!

383
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:50,500
Just because he's here
doesn't mean I can't be

384
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:52,375
a good host to Suzuhara.

385
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:53,458
[WAMIYA] Don't be greedy...!

386
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:55,833
You already have the siblings.

387
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,541
[MASUMI] That's true.

388
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:59,083
[WAMIYA] Now, go!

389
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:02,541
I'll see you
some other time...

390
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:04,333
Bye for now, Suzuhara.

391
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:09,541
Did you really have
to chase him away like that?

392
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,750
[WAMIYA] I'm about to do
something extraordinary...

393
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:14,208
something I didn't
want him to watch.

394
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,041
[IZUMIKO] Extraordinary?

395
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:25,708
[MIYUKI pants]

396
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:27,000
[IZUMIKO gasps]

397
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:34,416
Are you
really Suzuhara?

398
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,541
[IZUMIKO gasps]

399
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:37,458
[MIYUKI] Izumiko?

400
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:38,958
Are you sure?

401
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:44,291
That's what
I was hoping for.

402
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,958
Are you okay?

403
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:50,041
It's just that I can't
handle it very well

404
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:52,000
when you're dressed up
like the Hime-gami...

405
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:53,958
It sort of makes
my head spin.

406
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:55,083
I'm sorry...

407
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:57,208
My braids came undone.

408
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:00,708
But, you know what...?

409
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:03,666
I finally realized
than I am her...

410
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,041
and that made me so scared...

411
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:08,625
I didn't want
anybody to see me...

412
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:12,708
I thought I'd hide
for the rest of my life.

413
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,083
But...

414
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:17,875
you and Wamiya being here
changes that somehow...

415
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:20,291
I feel a little better.

416
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:23,541
I need you...

417
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:26,916
to tell me that you need me.

418
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,083
I won't know it
if you don't tell me...

419
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,458
and I won't fully believe
in what I do unless I know

420
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:33,583
that you really need me.

421
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,541
What I said
before still stands...

422
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:37,875
I won't become
your servant, ever.

423
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:40,375
But the Hime-gami is
too heavy a burden...

424
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:43,291
You can't carry it on your own.

425
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:45,041
Let me help
you find a path...

426
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,833
a way to avoid becoming
the Hime-gami completely...

427
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:49,833
and destroying
all of humanity...

428
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:51,250
Just tell me!

429
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,208
Say that you need me!

430
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:59,125
But if I tell you that...

431
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:01,875
If you do there will
be no going back.

432
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:12,166
[staff falls]

433
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:36,708
[MANATSU] We change as
we get older, right...?

434
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:39,375
And Masumi changes
along with us...

435
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:42,083
Changing doesn't
mean disappearing.

436
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:43,791
Masumi will
come back...

437
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:46,125
and when he does we'll
see that our bond may alter

438
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:47,708
but it won't vanish.

439
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:48,916
[KISARAGI] There you are!

440
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:52,791
We've all decided we should
go ahead with the last round

441
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:54,458
of the Battle Game, as planned.

442
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:55,583
We're going around
and making sure

443
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,125
that everyone
knows about it.

444
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:58,875
[OKOCHI] We thought it would
be best to distract everyone

445
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:00,083
with a game.

446
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:03,666
[IZUMIKO] This
dog is Takayanagi?

447
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,958
I figured you did it
without realizing it.

448
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,208
Admit what you did...

449
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:09,166
You cast a
spell, right...?

450
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,166
What was in that
hot air balloon?

451
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:14,166
[TAKAYANAGI] It was an
experimental hybrid curse.

452
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:17,333
There were some hallucinogenic
chemicals mixed in, as well.

453
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,208
Suzuhara...

454
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:24,083
I sincerely apologize for
underestimating you...

455
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:26,333
Please turn me
back into a human!

456
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:27,791
Well...

457
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:30,291
it's not that I
don't want to...

458
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,375
I just don't
know if I can.

459
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:35,208
[TAKAYANAGI]
I'm stuck like this?

460
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:37,708
[WAMIYA] Don't forget,
you almost never consciously

461
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:39,166
use your powers.

462
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,833
You need to set
your mind free...

463
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:43,583
and to do that,
you have to dance.

464
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,250
[HAYAKAWA] Uh...

465
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,083
At this point, we are
still unable to determine

466
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:50,500
exactly what is happening.

467
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:51,541
But the games will continue...

468
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:52,958
[BOY STUDENT 1]
What's going on?

469
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:53,791
[GIRL STUDENT 1] They have
arrows coming out of them!

470
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:54,583
[BOY STUDENT 2] Are those...

471
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:55,375
ghosts?

472
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:56,708
[BOY STUDENT 3] For real?

473
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:57,916
[BOY STUDENT 4] I didn't
know ghosts could smile...

474
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,250
[BOY STUDENT 5]
Where are they all going?

475
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,750
Masumi...

476
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:22,500
I'm sorry,
Mayura, but...

477
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:23,958
Well...

478
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:26,250
I found someone else who
could see me and I had to go.

479
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:28,041
How could
you do this...?

480
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:30,833

you down, huh?

done an excellent job dissolving

the spell on the school.

I'd say she's earned
a passing grade...

It's safe to say that she's
