1
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:32,250
[OKOCHI] So this
year's festival theme

2
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:34,333
is The Warring States
Period, from the fifteenth

3
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:36,208
and sixteenth centuries.

4
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:38,291
On the first day, we will
announce the stage events

5
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:41,583
and open the booths, which will
be judged by popular vote.

6
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:44,125
The points earned by this vote
will be distributed accordingly

7
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:45,625
for the following day's event...

8
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:47,250
the Warring States Game.

9
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:50,333
[OKOCHI] Now...

10
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:51,791
the president would like
to make an announcement.

11
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:55,333
As the Board of
Directors has suggested...

12
00:00:55,416 --> 00:00:58,000
Ojitero Houjou is going to
be the theme for the battle

13
00:00:58,083 --> 00:00:59,916
on day two of the festival.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,666
Yeah, sorry,
but what's that?

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,583
[OKOCHI] The ruins of
the Hachiouji Castle from

16
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:08,416
the late Warring States Period
are located near here.

17
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,083
The master of that
castle was Ujiteru Houjou,

18
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:14,041
the last warlord
to defy Hideyoshi.

19
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:16,916
He lost in the end, and
was ordered to commit suicide.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,875
Supposedly the battle
was super bloody!

21
00:01:17,958 --> 00:01:19,375
[KISARAGI] Okay, that's enough!

22
00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:21,750
You already ranted about this
in the Director's Room...

23
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:24,125
What we need to decide
today is how to incorporate

24
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:27,416
the pivotal battle into
some sort of a combat game.

25
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,541
Keep in mind that we
don't have that many days left,

26
00:01:29,625 --> 00:01:32,125
so we'll want to make sure
we manage our time well.

27
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:33,750
And, naturally,
I'll be counting on you

28
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:35,250
to help out with that.

29
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:36,458
Okay?

30
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:39,041
Hey, Kisaragi...!

31
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:40,958
I, like, totally forgot
to tell you something!

32
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:41,833
Hayakawa...!

33
00:01:41,916 --> 00:01:43,125
I'm in a meeting!

34
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:45,000
[HAYAKAWA] Oh, my bad...

Festival Committee Director
requesting assistance from

36
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:48,583
the Executive Committee.

37
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:50,416
It's lookin' like we're
gonna be short-handed for

38
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,000
the Warring States
traditional clothing demo.

39
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:54,875
[KISARAGI] Luckily, I already
planned on lending you

40
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:56,541
some members from the committee.

41
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:58,250
Great, this should
be easy, then...

42
00:01:58,333 --> 00:02:00,375
Do you have a warlord and
a princess we could borrow?

43
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:01,625
What, models?

44
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:03,041
Sure.

45
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:04,458
A little eye candy will
really get the party going...

46
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,625
I bet the crowd would just
eat Souda up if she was

47
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:09,041
our princess model.

48
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:10,125
Oh, please.

49
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:11,333
She couldn't model
to save her life.

50
00:02:11,416 --> 00:02:12,625
Excuse me?

51
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:14,041
[HAYAKAWA] Anyway, I'll
let you talk it out...

52
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:15,375
Thanks a lot!

53
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:17,541
One of these
days that guy is going

54
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,208
to give me a migraine.

55
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:20,666
[MANATSU] You're not supposed
to stand out, remember?

56
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,041
[MAYURA] I didn't say 'yes'!

57
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:24,208
I think you'd be way
better as the princess model.

58
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:25,708
That's ridiculous...

59
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:27,916
as student body president,
I could never do something

60
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,458
like that.

[TAKAYANAGI] Hello, Suzuhara.

Did you enjoy Togakushi?

69
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:24,416
I have a piece of
advice for you...

70
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,958
You should side with me
instead of Souda.

71

Oh, yeah?

72
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:29,333
And what makes you say that?

[TAKAYANAGI] The real battle

the school festival.

[TAKAYANAGI]
The school will open.

77
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:38,375
During the course
of the festival,

the academy's barrier
will be down...

you'll get help from the adults?

82

[TAKAYANAGI] That's not
necessarily what I meant, but,

83
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:51,000
really, none of us will be
standing here on our own

Not someone special.

00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,666
[construction sounds]

162
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,791
I need to head over
to the dressing room soon.

163
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:27,166
[IZUMIKO] So tell me...

164
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,625
why did you agree to fill in
as a model for this?

165
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:31,875
[MAYURA] It sounded easy enough,
and it doesn't hurt my cause

166
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:34,500
to be on the Festival
Committee's good side.

167
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:37,916
Also, Manatsu's out of the way,
off practicing archery...

168
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Which is a good thing because
he hates it when I dress up

169
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:41,333
for some reason.

170
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:43,750
I bet Masumi can't get
enough of it, though, huh?

171
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,500
[IZUMIKO] Have fun!

172
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,333
[MIYUKI] Got a second?

173
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:52,958
[IZUMIKO] What's up?

174
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,416
[MIYUKI] I wanted to know what
you're doing for your costume

175
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,000
on the day of the festival.

176
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:57,916
[IZUMIKO] My costume?

177
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,125
The Executive Committee's
wearing all black, right?

178
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:01,625
I don't mean that...

179
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,666
I want to know how you plan
to deal with your pigtails.

180
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,666
I'll probably be wearing
a hat, so I should be

181
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,000
able to get away with
putting them up in a bun.

182
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:09,541
[MIYUKI] So you're not
going to unbraid them...

183
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,708
no matter what?

184
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:12,666
I'm not sure.

185
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,625
What are you saying...?

186
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,166
How can you not be sure?!

187
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,375
In Togakushi, I realized
that I can unbraid

188
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:18,916
my hair without changing...

189
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,666
without becoming the Hime-gami.

190
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,708
[MIYUKI] But still-

191
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:22,833
I don't want
to spend my whole life

192
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:24,208
with my hair in braids!

193
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:26,708
I have to let it down someday.

194
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:29,083
And I would just like to be
prepared for what'll happen

195
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:30,791
when I do.

196
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:31,958
Oh, come on...

197
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:34,208
Is this a belated
rebellious stage?

198
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:36,500
[IZUMIKO] I have to learn
to look after myself...

199
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:39,166
There won't always be
someone there to help me.

200
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:42,541
I like your
determination...

201
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:45,125
but I think you might be
forgetting something...

202
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:48,166
Onmyouji spells, mantras,
and Ninja techniques...

203
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,333
they're all essentially
the same thing.

204
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:52,666
Spiritual self-defense...

205
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,916
As far as we know, you aren't
able to use your power

206
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,166
to defend yourself.

207
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,750
And as for her...

208
00:09:57,833 --> 00:10:01,791
I think the Hime-gami usually
uses a lower god for protection.

209
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:03,375
Unfortunately, you don't
have anything like

210
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:04,791
that to work with...

211
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:07,666
Do you know what spells
Onmyouji, Shugendou, and Ninpou,

212
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,958
or ninja techniques,
all have in common?

213
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:12,333
No, I don't know
what you're talking about.

214
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:14,416
First, there's Kuji.

215
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,000
Rin...

216
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:15,500
byou...

217
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:16,000
tou...

218
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:16,375
sha...

219
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:16,916
kai...

220
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,458
jin...

221
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:18,166
retsu...

222
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:18,666
zai...

223
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,958
zen.

224
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:21,291
Then there's another version...

225
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:22,708
Hayakuji.

226
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:24,000
Rin...

227
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:24,416
byou...

228
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:24,791
tou...

229
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:25,291
sha...

230
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:25,708
kai...

231
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:26,166
jin...

232
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:26,625
retsu...

233
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:27,041
zai...

234
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,125
zen.

235
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,458
I think it's a good
thing that you want to start

236
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:34,583
looking out for yourself and
fighting your own battles.

237
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:38,041
But you need to learn at least
one form of self-defense first.

238
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:38,833
I want to learn.

239
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:40,416
Please teach me.

240
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,083
[HODAKA] Good afternoon!

241
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:53,875
It's nice
to see you again.

242
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:56,250
Can't place me, huh...?

243
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:57,333
Hold on a second.

244
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:58,583
Maybe this will help.

245
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:01,583
[IZUMIKO] Is that you, Hodaka?!

246
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:02,458
Shh...!

247
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:03,875
Let's keep it on the down-low.

248
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:06,250
I don't want the others students
to know I'm here today.

249
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,208
So you're here
in your official capacity

250
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:09,791
as one of the judges?

251
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:11,541
[HODAKA] I was curious to
see how they were preparing

252
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:12,666
for battle...

253
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,583
So I thought I would
drop by and watch.

254
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:17,083
[IZUMIKO] When you say "they,"
are you talking about Takayanagi

255
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:18,333
and his supporters?

256
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:19,875
Maybe I am,
maybe I'm not...

257
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:23,166
But Souda seems to be
putting up quite a fight.

258
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,958
Ultimately, how she uses you
may be what determines whether

259
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:27,625
she wins or loses.

260
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:30,750
You're a bit of an
unknown entity, you see.

261
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:34,750
Like a hidden treasure
with mysterious properties.

262
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:37,041
How's the snotty brat...?

263
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,541
I mean, your partner...

264
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:41,541
You have truly been
paired up with somebody

265
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,375
unworthy of you, huh?

266
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:45,208
If you're talking
about Sagara...

267
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:47,416
He's doing fine, and
he's every bit as snotty

268
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,875
as he's always been.

269
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,958
Is that what you want to hear?

270
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:51,583
Whoops.

271
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:52,708
Did I hit a nerve?

272
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:53,791
Not at all.

273
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:54,750
Now, that's a lie.

274
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,000
You're angry.

275
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:00,125
As you know,
my position is such that

276
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:02,125
I'm not allowed
to assist anyone.

277
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:04,875
That said, I am terribly curious
to see what role you're going

278
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,666
to play in the festival.

279
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,541
[FEMALE GHOST] Milady!

280
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:08,666
Milady!

281
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,833
Hurry!

282
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:12,708
You have the ability
to see what others can't,

283
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:14,125
don't you...?

284
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:16,666
Well, can you see anything
besides divine spirits...?

285
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,500
Ghosts, for example.

286
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:21,083
I believe only those who
are able to see many things

287
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:23,041
are referred to as Saniwa.

288
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:25,583
Well, then, can you tell me...

289
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:27,666
is there something on campus?

290
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,875
It feels much more
comfortable than before.

291
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:34,208
[ORIKUCHI] Suzuhara!

292
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:35,375
 Good, I found you...!

293
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:37,500
We need you in the
dressing room, quickly!

294
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,958
[ORIKUCHI] Our middle school
model won't be able to make it.

295
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:43,250
I think she had a family
emergency or something.

296
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:44,125
So...

297
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:45,750
I kinda need to ask a favor...

298
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:48,750
You aren't talking about
having me model, are you?

299
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:51,291
I'm gonna fill in there.

300
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:54,583
But I was supposed
to MC the program.

301
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,125
Could you take my job...?

302
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,958
All you have to do
is read the script...

303
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:00,083
Occasionally, throw in some
adlib or ask the speaker

304
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:01,500
for a comment.

305
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,541
If those are my
choices, I'll model.

306
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,083
That's probably a better plan.

307
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:06,541
Have fun, okay?

308
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:08,875
Are you all right...?

309
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:10,791
I know this wasn't something
you were expecting.

310
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,208
[MAYURA] I don't really
think this is a set-up...

311
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:16,375
but I can't be too sure.

312
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:17,708
A set-up?

313
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:19,041
[MAYURA] We don't know
who Takayanagi's recruited

314
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:20,875
to his side, do we?

315
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,291
[DRESSER] Hi there!

316
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:23,958
[MAYURA] Just be careful.

317
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,458
[DRESSER] I'll be
dressing you today...

318
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:28,166
Wow...!

319
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,041
Your hair is so long...

320
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:31,750
First change into
the under-kimono,

321
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:33,041
and then I'll
do your make up.

322
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:34,208
Do you think...

323
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:36,208
I could put a wig
over my braids?

324
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:37,375
[DRESSER] No, sorry.

325
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:40,250
I'm afraid you'll
need to take them out.

326
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,541
[IZUMIKO] Did somebody plan
this to make it easier

327
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:45,666
for the Hime-gami to appear...?

328
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,208
What should I do?

329
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:49,958
Of course!

330
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:50,500
Rin...

331
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:51,208
byou...

332
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:51,708
tou...

333
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:52,291
sha...

334
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:53,000
kai...

335
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:53,583
Jin...

336
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,333
retsu...

337
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:54,916
zai...

338
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,041
zen.

339
00:13:58,750 --> 00:13:59,333
I can do this.

340
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:00,875
I know I can.

341
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:07,125
[HODAKA] So, how have
you been lately...?

342
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:07,833
Doing well?

343
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:08,833
Should be interesting.

344
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:10,500
I cannot wait to see.

345
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:12,958
[MAYURA] Hey, Hayakawa!

346
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:15,750
Oh... hey!

347
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:17,208
Souda, you came...!

348
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,166
Man, is it good to see you.

349
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,916
Boy, you sure oughtta
brighten up the auditorium...

350
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,791
Oh...

351
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:23,958
I'm sorry...

352
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:26,166
May I ask the name
of this other princess?

353
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,625
[MAYURA] Surely your
memory's not that bad...

354
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:32,333
You met her along with
the rest of the committee.

355
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:33,625
[HAYAKAWA] I did...?

356
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:34,791
Wait...

357
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:37,875
Hold on, are you Suzuhara?

358
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:39,333
Oh, wow!

359
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:42,333
[ORIKUCHI] Thank you for
your patience, everybody.

360
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:45,291
At this time, I would like to
invite our models to please

361
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:47,125
take the stage.

362
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:53,708
[applause]

363
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:54,458
Oh, my goodness.

364
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:55,791
Would you look at that?

365
00:14:58,125 --> 00:14:59,250
[IZUMIKO] You
don't have to worry.

366
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,458
I'm not switching
places with her.

367
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:04,916
I can't let that happen
in front of everyone.

368
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,458
[ORIKUCHI] And now, let me
introduce our volunteers...

369
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:10,458
First up, modeling for
Toshije Maeda, we have--

370
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:11,291
Oops...!

371
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:12,250
Uh, Hi...!

372
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:13,750
So, my name's Hayakawa.

373
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:14,500
Aaand...

374
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:15,541
what else...?

375
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,416
This hat is
surprisingly heavy...

376
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,666
And hot, too!

377
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,875
[laughs]

378
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:23,833
[BOY STUDENT 1]
Who's that girl?

379
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:24,791
[BOY STUDENT 2]
On the end...?

380
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:25,875
Beats me.

381
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:28,458
[IZUMIKO] Am I insane?

382
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:29,875
What was I thinking...?

383
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:32,916
Letting myself get
dragged into this.

384
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,625
No, I'll be fine...

385
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:37,833
Besides, I know how
to defend myself now.

386
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:38,708
Hey, over here!

387
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:40,083
Look at the camera, please.

388
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:44,708
Not only is Souda modeling,
but so is Suzuhara...!

389
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:47,041
Best clothing demo ever!

390
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:07,125
[IZUMIKO] I saw you with Hodaka.

391
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:08,708
What were you talking about?

392
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:10,333
[MIYUKI] We were wondering what
the chances were that you were

393
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:12,791
going to do something crazy.

394
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:14,916
Well, I didn't
do anything crazy.

395
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,125
What the heck was
going through your head when

396
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,875
you agreed to be a model?!

397
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:20,208
There are plenty of other
girls who could've done it!

398
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:21,833
Thanks a lot.

399
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,208
[IZUMIKO] I pulled it off
without a hitch,

400
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:26,125
and this is how he reacts?

401
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,250
I just can't win with him.

402
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:30,125
Didn't you realize there are
people out there who would love

403
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:32,583
to use your game of dress-up
as an opportunity to summon

404
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:33,958
the Hime-gami...?

405
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:36,500
I bet you never
even considered it.

406
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:39,041
Even Murakami was stunned that
you left yourself wide open

407
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:40,166
like that.

408
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,583
[HIME-GAMI] Stunned, was he...?

409
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,416
In that case this
was not his doing.

410
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,791
[MIYUKI] I don't see what
the big deal is, anyway.

411
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:46,208
What's wrong with braids...?

412
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,958
I mean, it's not like
they're all that bad.

413
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,041
[HIME-GAMI] Oh...?

414
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:51,791
They're "not all that bad," eh?

415
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:54,500
[MIYUKI gasps]

416
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:57,416
[HIME-GAMI] I find them
quite stifling, actually...

417
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,875
but perhaps one must
become used to them.

418
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:01,916
[MIYUKI] It happened...!

419
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,583
Why now?

420
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:04,833
[HIME-GAMI] A short skirt...!

421
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:06,875
My legs feel so free...!

422
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:08,083
How wonderful...!

423
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,916
I could walk for hours.

424
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,250
What a splendid feeling...

425
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:16,708
It took quite a while, but
here I am, at long last.

426
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:20,416
Why do you wear
a look of such apprehension?

427
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,166
Are you not pleased
to see me again...?

428
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,916
I thought you would be.

429
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,458
The real Suzuhara
is good enough for me...

430
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:27,541
thanks.

431
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:30,541
Oh, come now,
you needn't be shy...

432
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,083
It finally happened...

433
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:35,833
I can now synchronize with this
body as if it were mine...

434
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:38,833
Today is a day to be celebrated.

435
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:40,833
This is my right hand...

436
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:44,000
It is with this hand that
I give to the masses.

437
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,750
This is my left hand...

438
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:50,041
It is with this hand that
I accept offerings from

439
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:51,416
the heavens.

440
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,125
I find both meet my needs...

441
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:55,666
Yes, quite satisfactory...

442
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:56,750
Now then...

443
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:59,750
which of my hands
would you prefer?

444
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:01,791
I don't know what
you're talking about.

445
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:03,875
[HIME-GAMI]
Which would you hold?

446
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:07,750
Hey, listen...!

447
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,208
You need to return to--

448
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:11,625
[HIME-GAMI] Snub me and face
my divine wrath, Sagara...

449
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:14,166
Is that understood?

450
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:16,750
This is the first time
I have been able

451
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,875
to move about freely...

452
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:21,166
As such, I wish to take a walk.

453
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:24,375
Hey...

454
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:25,625
Oh, crap!

455
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:34,416
[HIME-GAMI] Say something.

456
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,083
[MIYUKI] What should I say?

457
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:37,875
Fine.

458
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:39,375
I have a question, then...

459
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:41,916
When you're here,
where does Suzuhara go?

460
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,250
[HIME-GAMI] I would not know...

461
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:45,000
It does not interest me.

462
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:49,583
[MIYUKI] Why does it take a
little while for Suzuhara

463
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:52,208
to remember what happened
when you take over her body?

464
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:53,625
Do you know that?

465
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:56,458
[HIME-GAMI] Perhaps remembering
is too much trouble...

466
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:57,833
Enough of this.

467
00:18:57,916 --> 00:19:00,208
I do not like it when
you speak of other women...

468
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:01,541
If, for example...

469
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:03,916
I was to speak of
nothing but Yukimasa...

470
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,541
how would you feel then?

471
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:06,375
[MIYUKI] No way...

472
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:07,208
that's a totally different--

473
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:08,791
[HIME-GAMI] It is not...!

474
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:12,416
When I am enjoying the present,
do not spoil my fun...

475
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,125
I have so little.

476
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,916
[MIYUKI] Are you happy now...?

477
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,333
This is Hachiouji
Castle's keep...

478
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:29,250
You said you wanted
to come here.

479
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:30,791
[HIME-GAMI] So I did.

480
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:38,958
[HIME-GAMI] Do not be afraid.

481
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:40,458
Nothing is here...

482
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:44,708
There are no what you call
"vengeful spirits" about...

483
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:47,583
If there were,
then it would be I.

484
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:50,875
[MIYUKI] Does that mean...

485
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:53,416
Are you a human who passed away?

486
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,958
[MIYUKI] Did you die
filled with regret?

487
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:59,333
How could I have
passed without regret...?

488
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:01,500
After what I was
responsible for...

489
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:04,166
I brought humanity
to its demise.

490
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,083
[HIME-GAMI] I despaired for what
my species did to the world...

491
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,666
I destroyed it
along with myself...

492
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:14,833
But...

493
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,708
after I had lost my body...

494
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:19,541
I learned that I was able
to travel through the past.

495
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:20,958
I yearned for help...

496
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:24,750
From the very core of my
being, I cried out for it.

497
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:28,083
If the future is not
to end in destruction...

498
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:29,916
I must find someone...

499
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,375
someone who can understand me.

500
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:35,666
After an experiment that spanned
more than a thousand years,

501
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:39,166
I found that only my brain and
ovaries had been preserved.

502
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:42,250
They had become what
is known as World Heritages...

503
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:43,458
However...

504
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:45,666
humanity's dire future
remained unchanged.

505
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,250
World Heritages?

506
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:48,708
Thrice I have done this...

507
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:50,833
Thrice I have passed like
this through thousands

508
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,208
of generations of women...

509
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,625
Because I lack
a body of my own...

510
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:59,208
I am gradually beginning
to forget who I am.

511
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:01,875
And so I doubt there
will be a fourth time...

512
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:04,958
This will be my final chance.

513
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:07,000
You aren't
actually a deity, then...

514
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:09,291
You're a human woman from
Suzuhara's family line,

515
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:11,125
aren't you?

516
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:12,833
I am responsible
for the destruction

517
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:14,583
of the whole human race...

518
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:16,791
How, then, can I be human?

519
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,416
Do you want to know
how frightening my power was...?

520
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,625
I was murdered for it
in my second future...

521
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:24,958
They killed me and
placed me on display.

522
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:27,291
[MIYUKI] What a
terrifying thought.

523
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:29,125
You must understand me...

524
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:32,833
My abilities make me the
antagonist of the human race...

525
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,041
I side with those who
fight for the planet,

526
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:37,125
rather than for humans...

527
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:39,750
I am searching for people
who can comprehend that...

528
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:42,041
and will hold me back.

529
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:43,041
[MIYUKI] Yukimasa...

530
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:44,083
Yukariko...

531
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:45,500
the Mountain Monks...

532
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:48,041
that's what they do?

533
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,250
And you want me ...

534
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:51,875
You want my help
with this, too...

535
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:54,833
Can I please have some time to
think about it before I decide?

536
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,041
Do not be ridiculous.

537
00:21:58,125 --> 00:21:59,875
Wamiya is intended to serve me.

538
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:01,750
I'm in the Sagara family!

539
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:02,708
[HIME-GAMI] True...

540
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:04,666
and yet you are also Wamiya...

541
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,583
Do you not recall how
beautifully you melded

542
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:09,291
at Togakushi?

543
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:11,583
I can remove
him from you easily.

544
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,375
Miyuki Sagara
here does not seem to care

545
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:19,541
for you much.

546
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:21,250
[WAMIYA] Trust me,
the feeling is mutual...

547
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:22,875
I can't stand him, either.

548
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:25,041
I only decided to stay
with him because he was

549
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:27,875
so utterly helpless
and pathetic.

550
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:29,375
[HIME-GAMI] Oh, yes...

551
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:32,041
It has never been in your
nature to look after humans...

552
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:33,375
has it?

553
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:34,916
[WAMIYA] I know you're
starting to forget things,

554
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,125
but that's fine...

555
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:38,125
I just want you to know
I'm here to help you

556
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:39,708
in whatever way you need.

557
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:43,375
Now you are treating
me like a doddering old lady...?

558
00:22:43,458 --> 00:22:44,583
That is enough...

559
00:22:44,666 --> 00:22:45,791
Return now.

560
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:48,750
Look...

561
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:49,916
I'm going to have to put
some serious thought

562
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,416
into Wamiya, too...

563
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,500
Now, please...

564
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:55,166
will you please
return Suzuhara to me?

565
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,625
And if I do not want to?

566
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,833
You cannot force me
to leave against my will.

567
00:22:59,916 --> 00:23:02,666
I am protected
by a self-defense spell.

568
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,541
You remember.

569
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:06,625
The one you taught me earlier.

570
00:23:06,708 --> 00:23:08,333
Besides, what more
could you want

571
00:23:08,416 --> 00:23:09,958
than what you have now...?

572
00:23:10,041 --> 00:23:12,416
Time alone here with me.

573
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:16,791
I release you!

574
00:23:16,875 --> 00:23:18,208
Return now from
the field of battle!

575
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:20,625
Izumiko!

576
00:23:20,708 --> 00:23:21,833
Come back to me...!

577
00:23:21,916 --> 00:23:22,958
Izumiko!

578
00:23:23,041 --> 00:23:23,875
I know you...!

579
00:23:23,958 --> 00:23:24,875
Please...!

580
00:23:24,958 --> 00:23:26,666
You have to make
the right choice!

581
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:33,458
♪

582
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:01,833
[IZUMIKO] It sounds
like you'd rather spend time

583
00:25:01,916 --> 00:25:03,583
with the Hime-gami than with me.
