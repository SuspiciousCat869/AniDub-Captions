I don't understand
what's happening...

Why would Masumi
have taken him away?

I wish I knew...

[PROF. SOUDA] My daughter
likes to keep me informed...

She's told me that both of
you are able to see Masumi.

I hoped you could explain to
me what happened with him...

What did he do?

I'm sorry...

seems to be unique...

00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:04,625
I doubt that anybody
could replicate it...

27

It's not a spell...

28
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:08,833
it seems more like
an innate gift.

[PROF. SOUDA] In this

It appears that a special
form of atavism has emerged

She hates to hear
them speak of Masumi.

birth to them, she can sense

something ominous in the name.

It was strange,
though...

47
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:01,416
Manatsu talked about how you
would live a long life...

48
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,250
like he didn't expect
that for himself.

I guess I shouldn't
be surprised...

50

but see, the thing is...

51
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:10,958
Manatsu has the same heart
problem that took Masumi

our mother doesn't
like to remember Masumi.

57

Manatsu is a lot closer
to Masumi than he is to me...

I've always known that.

I never imagined that
this would happen...

I didn't know that Manatsu
would choose to leave me

he's trying too hard to
do what's best for you...

65
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:40,708
and he's responding with his
heart instead of his head.

66
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:43,416
If he wants so badly
to do what's best for me...

67
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,583
then he should leave Masumi's
plane and come back here.

68
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,416
You know the whole reason
I want to be the top student

What I've been working toward
for as long as I can remember.

understand that.

[IZUMIKO] Do you have a second?

75
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:09,583
I need your advice

Earlier...

00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:13,416
you said nobody could replicate
what Mayura and Manatsu

78
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,000
do to call Masumi.

79
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:15,916
[MIYUKI] That's what I said.

80
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,541
What of it?

81
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:19,416
[IZUMIKO] The Hime-gami.

82
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,583
[MIYUKI] Slow down...

83
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,416
Why are you
bringing her up now?

84
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,958
Maybe she could help us...

85
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:26,833
Don't you think she might
know how to summon Masumi?

86
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:29,166
[MIYUKI] How could you
even suggest that?

87
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,125
[IZUMIKO] I think
it's possible...

88
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:34,458
Obviously, I can't talk to
her or ask her about it...

89
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:35,916
I can't, but you can!

90
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,375
[MIYUKI] Stop right there!

91
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:41,666
This is completely crazy...!

92
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,166
What are you thinking?

93
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,791
I'm thinking about
what it will mean

94
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:48,125
if Manatsu ends up staying
on the other side.

95
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:49,708
You mean...

96
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:53,083
you're referring to the other
plane of existence Masumi made?

97
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,083
Yes...

98
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:55,666
Know what I thought before...?

99
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,958
That I had dragged you into a
world that you weren't meant

100
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:59,500
to be a part of...

101
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:02,791
that you otherwise would've
had nothing to do with.

102
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:06,250
But then I saw how easily you
associated with Masumi...

103
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:09,291
and I started to
wonder if I was right.

104
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:11,541
If I turn into
the Hime-gami...

105
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:12,916
will you do it...?

106
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,291
Will you talk to her?

107
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:15,208
[MIYUKI] Hold on...!

108
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,291
Is that something you can do?

109
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:18,583
I won't know...

110
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:19,875
not until I try.

111
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:21,625
Don't be so
casual about it...!

112
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:23,458
The Hime-gami is dangerous...!

113
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:25,958
She's so dangerous that I can't
even imagine what will happen

114
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:27,416
if she does show up.

115
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,708
I'm scared, too...!

116
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:30,708
The Hime-gami frightens me...

117
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:33,083
Becoming her isn't
something that I want.

118
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:34,458
Not at all...!

119
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:36,333
But we have to try everything
we can think of...!

120
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:39,208
Otherwise we might
lose Manatsu for good.

121
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:41,625
And you're sure...?

122
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,291
Completely?

123
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:44,625
I am...

124
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,291
Mayura's more than my roommate.

125
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:48,166
She's become a true friend...

126
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,458
She really took me under her
wing and helped me fit in

127
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:52,833
at school and with
the Student Council...

128
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:54,083
and now...

129
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:57,125
I have a chance to show
her how grateful I am.

130
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,750
Don't you see...?

131
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:01,166
This is the way I can repay her.

132
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:09,833
[MIYUKI] Okay are you ready?

133
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:32,958
It's still me.

134
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:34,750
We didn't switch.

135
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:36,500
So what, is there
something else we need to do

136
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:38,833
before we can summon her?

137
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,916
[IZUMIKO] Maybe I'm
standing in the wrong spot.

138
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,666
[MIYUKI] She isn't a cell phone.

139
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,458
[IZUMIKO] Hey...!

140
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:46,041
I felt something just ...

141
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,458
now...

142
00:07:58,333 --> 00:07:59,833
[IZUMIKO] Strange...

143
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:01,291
[MASUMI] Hi, Suzuhara...

144
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:04,541
Did you come back
to keep your promise?

145
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:06,208
[IZUMIKO] Is that you,
Masumi...?

146
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:09,333
Why in the world are
you wearing that outfit?

147
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:11,166
[MASUMI] After seeing
Kisaragi in hers,

148
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,083
I thought it might be fun.

149
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,041
You have Manatsu!

150
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,250
Where is he?

151
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:16,791
[MASUMI] Here, but further in.

152
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,666
What do you mean,
"further in"?

153
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,916
Togakushi has a bunch
of different layers in it,

154
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,083
you know.

155
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,416
Why are you trying
to break Mayura's heart?

156
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,666
It's not right...!

157
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,333
Now, send Manatsu
back where he belongs!

158
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:33,583
[MASUMI] I'm trying not
to break Mayura's heart.

159
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:34,708
Have you seen her...?

160
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:37,166
Do you know how sad
she is right now?

161
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,041
[MASUMI] If we part now,
her sorrow will be less...

162
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,458
It will pass...

163
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:44,166
But the longer Manatsu and
I wait to go, the heavier

164
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,333
a burden her grief will become.

165
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:47,625
Oh, really...?

166
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:50,583
Is that what Manatsu
thinks or what you think?

167
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:53,041
We're of a like mind in this.

168
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:55,875
Over time, I've come
to like being Masumi...

169
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:57,708
I don't want to vanish.

170
00:08:57,791 --> 00:09:00,083
But I'm well aware that
Mayura wouldn't hesitate

171
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,916
to choose Manatsu over me.

172
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,208
And in that case...

173
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,250
it makes sense for us
to become one before

174
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,458
she is forced to choose.

175
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:09,791
[IZUMIKO]
But Masumi...

176
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,958
are you going
to vanish?

177
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:15,583
[MASUMI] As long as I remain in
Togakushi, nothing will change.

178
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:16,708
Not for me...

179
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:18,333
but you humans are different...

180
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:19,958
You seem to change
far more quickly than

181
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,666
I would have expected.

182
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,916
[IZUMIKO] Let me
talk to Manatsu.

183
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,708
I don't think you can...

184
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,208
He's inside a cave.

185
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:30,000
[IZUMIKO] Oh.

186
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,041
All right...

187
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:32,625
then you can take me
to the cave.

188
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:35,125
The night is awfully
deep around here...

189
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,125
Are you certain?

190
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,875
Of course I am...

191
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:40,666
It was night the last time
we met, remember?

192
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:45,375
[MASUMI] So, you're the type of
girl who finds her true strength

193
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:47,541
when she's in a
difficult situation.

194
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:48,625
Well, you know...

195
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:49,958
that's very attractive.

196
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:52,625
Which reminds me,
remember how I asked you out?

197
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,625
[IZUMIKO] Yes, I remember.

198
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:58,041
But right now,
Manatsu comes first.

199
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:00,958
All right, all right...

200
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:02,625
Well, come on, then.

201
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,208
Tell me something...

202
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:22,000
If, between you and Manatsu,
only one of you could make it

203
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,166
back from here...

204
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,750
Who would you choose?

205
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,375
I wouldn't choose
either of us...

206
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:29,541
What right would I have
to make that call...?

207
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:31,916
We both have people
waiting for us.

208
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:45,250
Here we are.

209
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:46,791
This is the cave.

210
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:49,208
You'll have to find
a way to open it, though.

211
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,125
[IZUMIKO] Manatsu...!

212
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:01,833
its me if you're in
there please come out!

213
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,666
I want to talk to you.

214
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,250
What's this boulder
doing blocking the entrance...?

215
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:11,750
How could he possibly have
gotten past something this big?

216
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,166
"Spirited behind a boulder"...

217
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,958
These things happen sometimes.

218
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:18,458
However, it would not have
happened if Manatsu hadn't

219
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:20,625
been perfectly willing.

220
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:23,833
He went into that
cave of his own free will.

221
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:27,208
[IZUMIKO] Right.

222
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:28,916
Okay.

223
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,750
[KISARAGI] Just as in the myth
of Ame no Uzume no Mikoto...

224
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:35,791
the tale that tells of this
mountain's beginnings...

225
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:38,583
dance has the power to purify.

226
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,666
[IZUMIKO] I don't know
what else to try...

227
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,000
Dancing may be the answer.

228
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:47,250
[IZUMIKO] Please, Masumi...

229
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,500
Do you have a fan I can have?

230
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,125
[MASUMI] I had a feeling
you'd be asking for one.

231
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:06,958
[IZUMIKO] Manatsu. You shouldn't
become part of this world.

232
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:08,541
Listen to me...

233
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:11,791
Nothing would make us happier
than if you were to come back.

234
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:14,625
Come out of there...

235
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,208
Please!

236
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:32,875
[singing in Japanese]

237
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:44,208
[singing in Japanese]

238
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:45,625
[IZUMIKO] Manatsu...

239
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:48,500
Mayura, your parents,
everyone...

240
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:50,791
we're all worried about you!

241
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,250
[MANATSU] Don't open the cave!

242
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,166
Masumi is on
the other side...!

243
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,041
It has to stay closed!

244
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:12,875
Hold on...!

245
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,625
What are you talking about?

246
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:16,250
But I thought I was with Masumi.

247
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:19,291
Wasn't he the one out here?

248
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:20,458
[MANATSU] You see...

249
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:22,625
I thought we could be one...

250
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,041
We can't...

251
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:27,000
I should never have considered
it in the first place...

252
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:28,250
Never...

253
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,916
He wants to break the
boulder and come out.

254
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,166
But wait...

255
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,833
hasn't he already come
to the outside world?

256
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:38,166
[MANATSU] Masumi is only a
small part of a greater being.

257
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:42,000
If his entire body makes it out,
he won't be Masumi anymore.

258
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,791
Thank you
so much, Suzuhara...

259
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,750
for coming after me.

260
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,083
Who is...?

261
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:56,583
Mayura's here.

262
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:59,833
[MAYURA cries]

263
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:01,500
I'm sorry.

264
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,125
[MAYURA] I'm still going to hit
you and scream at you later.

265
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,208
But for now...

266
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:09,708
it's just so good to see you.

267
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:13,791
[MANATSU] How did
you get here...?

268
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:16,000
when you didn't have
Masumi with you.

269
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:17,041
[MAYURA] I didn't need him.

270
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:18,125
Sagara brought me.

271
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:19,166
[IZUMIKO] Huh?!

272
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,708
What do you mean
Sagara brought you?

273
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:22,041
How could he have done that?

274
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:23,708
We can save the
explanations for later.

275
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:25,250
Look behind you!

276
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,958
[IZUMIKO] What is that?

277
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:51,708
[MIYUKI] Hey, snap out of it...

278
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:54,458
Do you know how to close
the cave's entrance?

279
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:55,875
[IZUMIKO] No idea...

280
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:58,916
All I know is that I was
trying to open it by dancing.

281
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,333
[MIYUKI] How about you two?

282
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:01,625
We don't know either...

283
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,208
We can only summon him.

284
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:05,291
[MIYUKI] You have got
to be kidding me...

285
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:07,291
What the hell are
we gonna do now?

286
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,958
[MIYUKI] Just run for it!

287
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:17,333
[MANATSU] The real Masumi is on
the other side of that boulder!

288
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,625
We're in real trouble...

289
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:21,250
Once he's out he could
easily devour us.

290
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:40,375
[IZUMIKO] You have a staff?

291
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:41,916
[IZUMIKO gasps]

292
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:44,208
Keep running...!

293
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:46,000
We'll catch up later!

294
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:00,916
[IZUMIKO] Oh, no!

295
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:11,333
[MIYUKI] Monsters
and villains...

296
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:15,208
Goblins and devils, Dragons
and poisonous beasts...

297
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:17,125
poisonous insects...

298
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:18,958
Hear the sound
of my staff...!

299
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:20,791
Offer me no harm!

300
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:24,916
Sagara...

301
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,125
you sprouted wings...

302
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:27,791
How is that even possible?

303
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:28,875
[MIYUKI] It isn't.

304
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:30,791
But I can see
them right there.

305
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,208
Well, they aren't real.

306
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,916
Won't you at least try
to explain what you're doing?

307
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,208
Protecting you...

308
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:38,375
That's the best
I can hope to do.

309
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:41,291
There's no way I can force
that thing back into the cave.

310
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:44,541
[HIME-GAMI] So it would seem.

311
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,916
This task is too great for you.

312
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:49,833
It isn't me!

313
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:52,416
[HIME-GAMI] Hand me the
staff that you carry.

314
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:05,000
[HIME-GAMI] You have
suffered long, local deity,

315
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:07,375
for none have been
able to summon you.

316
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:11,666
It is not yet time
for your awakening.

317
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:15,625
But your day will come...

318
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:17,958
And on that day,
Great Nine-Headed Dragon,

319
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:20,958
you will be released
from all that binds you.

320
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,625
For now, return
to your slumber.

321
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:49,083
[HIME-GAMI] This is right.

322
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:51,875
The Great Nine-Headed
Dragon left one head before

323
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:54,333
returning to the cave.

324
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:57,750
You may continue to refer to
the dream seen by that head

325
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:01,625
as "Masumi." Assuming you are
still able to summon him,

326
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:03,166
that is.

327
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,958
[IZUMIKO] Lady Hime-gami!

328
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:12,458
Please ...

329
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:14,375
If it's possible...

330
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:15,625
can we...

331
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:18,125
remain separate
from each other?

332
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:20,833
Instead of turning
into you like before...

333
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:22,125
can I remain myself?

334
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,791
Can I see you
and not become you?

335
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,625
[HIME-GAMI] To ask
a question like that...

336
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:29,291
You still understand nothing.

337
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,541
Ask that of your mother.

338
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:34,875
I can't...

339
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:37,000
I never see my mother!

340
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:50,333
It is you...!

341
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:53,583
But Mom, what are
you doing here?

342
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,750
Is that really her?

343
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:57,750
[YUKARIKO] That wasn't
so bright, you two...

344
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:59,666
What in the world were you
thinking, meddling with

345
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,208
a powerful being like that?

346
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:03,708
What the Hime-gami
said while we

347
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:04,916
were on the other side...

348
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,166
Was she trying to say
that she's with you now?

349
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,625
[YUKARIKO] That's
right, you got it...

350
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:10,666
and that's the reason that
you and I aren't supposed

351
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,291
to see each other
all that frequently...

352
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:14,166
For now...

353
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,125
I carry the Hime-gami...

354
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:19,500
but I don't know how much longer
I'll be able to contain her.

355
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:21,291
[IZUMIKO] Were you okay with
it when you started turning

356
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:22,583
into the Hime-gami?

357
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:24,708
Did you accept it
just like that?

358
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:26,125
Am I being selfish?

359
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:29,500
Is it wrong of me to want
to be like everyone else?

360
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:30,833
No, not at all...

361
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:32,875
Honestly, it'd be strange
if you weren't at least

362
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:34,625
a little hesitant.

363
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,666
[YUKARIKO] I'm afraid
neither of you realize just

364
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,291
how unstable you truly are.

365
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:40,583
You must change...

366
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:43,583
How to do so is the
question that faces you...

367
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:45,916
It is a deadly question
that everybody who has

368
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,458
spiritual powers
must confront.

369
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:51,375
I intervened to settle
things for you this time...

370
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:54,125
So fortunately, your real
trial has been put off

371
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,708
for a little longer.

372
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:57,083
How can I face it...?

373
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:59,583
I don't think I'm
strong enough, Mom.

374
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:00,833
[YUKARIKO] That's right...

375
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:03,541
But I'm strong enough
for both of us, Izumiko.

376
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:07,708
So for as long as I am able
to do so, I'll protect you.

377
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,916
But that isn't
going to last forever.

378
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:14,583
It was good to
see you two...

379
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:16,041
Stay here and wait
for your friends.

380
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:17,625
They'll be along.

381
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:23,500
Wow, Yukariko is really
something else, isn't she?

382
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:24,875
Yeah, she is...

383
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,875
It's kinda difficult for me
to think of her as my mom

384
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,125
sometimes.

385
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:31,666
[MIYUKI] She sure is pretty.

386
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,083
Hey, you know something...?

387
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:34,583
I think you should try to
start making your thoughts

388
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,791
and feelings clearer.

389
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:37,958
It's like everything
always comes

390
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:39,250
out of the blue with you.

391
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,583
You're the one who
doesn't tell anyone anything...!

392
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:43,875
I have no idea what you're
thinking half the time!

393
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:46,666
You bottle up your feelings and
hoard secrets like they're gold!

394
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,583
Well, that's because--

395
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:48,416
[MANATSU] There they are...!

396
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:48,875
Shinkou...!

397
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:50,083
Suzuhara!

398
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:53,041
We were so worried,
but you made it back!

399
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:54,583
[MAYURA] Are you okay?

400
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:55,750
[IZUMIKO] I'm fine.

401
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:57,458
I not hurt or anything.

402
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:59,208
All of a sudden
we were at the shrine...

403
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:02,375
Standing right in front of
the komainu shrine guardians.

404
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:03,958
Man, I'm starving...!

405
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:07,000
I haven't had anything
to eat in two whole days.

406
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,875
There's a noodle
stand by the shrine gates

407
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,375
if you can make it that far.

408
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:11,458
[MANATSU] I dunno...

409
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:12,958
you might have to carry me.

410
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:15,333
[EVERYONE laughs]

411
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,666
[MAYURA] I'll never forget
what you did for Manatsu.

412
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,500
Not for as long as I live.

413

♪

414
00:23:00,791 --> 00:23:03,208
[IZUMIKO] Miyuki and I returned
home to Tamakura Shrine

415
00:23:03,291 --> 00:23:06,541
to spend the second half
of the summer vacation.

416
00:23:06,625 --> 00:23:08,041
I don't know why...

417
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:10,416
but out of the blue, Miyuki
asked me to perform a dance

418
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,083
to summon Wamiya.

419
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:15,750
[MIYUKI] I figured
it wouldn't work.

420
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:16,250
[IZUMIKO] You did?

421
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:17,833
Why?

422
00:23:17,916 --> 00:23:19,916
[MIYUKI] Because you were acting
all buddy-buddy with Masumi...

423
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,541
so Wamiya's sulking now.

424
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:22,375
Huh...?

425
00:23:22,458 --> 00:23:23,875
But how could you know that?

426
00:23:23,958 --> 00:23:25,375
For a while I really
thought we'd seen

427
00:23:25,458 --> 00:23:26,791
the last of Wamiya...

428
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:27,958
but then...

429
00:23:28,041 --> 00:23:31,083
one day a talking crow
flew into my dorm.

430
00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:34,625
He said he lacked the power to
take on human form in Tokyo...

431
00:23:34,708 --> 00:23:36,250
I recognized the voice.

432
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,375
Is that why you
ended up outside the room

433
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:41,541
when Kisaragi
performed at the inn...?

434
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:44,083
And why it looked like you
had black wings after we fled

435
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:45,416
from the cave?

436
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,541
[MIYUKI] He told me if
we wanted to follow you...

437
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:50,166
he and I would have
to combine our powers.

438
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:53,083
I was wondering...

439
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:55,833
when Souda said you had entered
the school as my partner...

440
00:23:55,916 --> 00:23:58,958
how did you feel?

441
00:23:59,041 --> 00:24:00,541
I mean, do you...

442
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:03,166
think of me that way?

443
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:05,375
Well, to be honest
with you, it's hard to say...

444
00:24:05,458 --> 00:24:07,958
In some ways I think
of you as a partner,

445
00:24:08,041 --> 00:24:10,208
but in some ways I don't.

446
00:24:10,291 --> 00:24:11,791
I mean...

447
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:13,666
it's difficult when I get the
feeling that you stay with me

448
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:16,333
in spite of what
you really want.

449
00:24:16,416 --> 00:24:18,625
[MIYUKI] Even I wasn't certain
what I really wanted...

450
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:20,041
I was torn.

451
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,333
That thing with
Souda and Takayanagi...

452
00:24:22,416 --> 00:24:23,583
I don't know...

453
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:25,333
It made me think I'd be
better off just going to

454
00:24:25,416 --> 00:24:27,125
a normal school...

455
00:24:27,208 --> 00:24:28,833
but then the crow
showed up...

456
00:24:28,916 --> 00:24:31,041
and I began to
question that, too.

457
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,416
May I ask you
something...?

458
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,208
Do you find it at all strange
that Wamiya and Takayanagi

459
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:39,916
look so much alike?

460
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,583
Huh...?

461
00:24:40,666 --> 00:24:42,041
Why do you ask?

462
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:44,041
[MIYUKI] It just bothers me
that Wamiya looks so much

463
00:24:44,125 --> 00:24:45,416
like that pompous jerk.

464
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,750
[IZUMIKO] I still don't
see why it's a big deal.

465
00:24:47,833 --> 00:24:49,375
[MIYUKI] To be blunt...

466
00:24:49,458 --> 00:24:51,208
That's the kind of guy
you're attracted to.

467
00:24:51,291 --> 00:24:53,125
Guys who look like
the two of them.

468
00:24:55,375 --> 00:24:57,083
[IZUMIKO] What?!

469
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:02,125
[IZUMIKO] Just so I know,
when you say "you"...

470
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,666
do you mean me...

471
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,041
or do you mean...
