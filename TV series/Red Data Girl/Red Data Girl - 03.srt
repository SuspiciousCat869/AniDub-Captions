1
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:56,416
That's better.

2
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,208
It's nice to be back.

3
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:14,041
[MIYUKI] You sure you should
be up and about already?

4
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:15,583
I'm fine...

5
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:18,666
I think a good night's sleep
in my own bed is all I needed.

6
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,583
[MIYUKI] Yeah, I kinda had a
feeling that might be the case.

7
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:24,291
[IZUMIKO] So, you're
practicing early.

8
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,291
[MIYUKI] I need to
get back to my routine.

9
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:28,000
[IZUMIKO] Oh...

10
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:29,000
Uh...

11
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:30,708
Hey, do you know what?

12
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:33,541
You might be able to
see the ocean from the top of

13
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:35,166
the mountain this morning...

14
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,625
Want to look?

15
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:51,416
[MIYUKI] This is
a nice place, huh?

16
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:54,375
[IZUMIKO] I'm just glad
you got a chance to see it

17
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:55,958
before you left.

18
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:57,541
[MIYUKI] Before I left?

19
00:01:57,625 --> 00:02:00,708
[IZUMIKO] Well, I mean, Sagara
changed his mind, didn't he...?

20
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:03,666
I figured you'd be transferring
back to your old school.

21
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,375
You must be glad.

22
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,250
[MIYUKI] No...

23
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:07,958
I doubt I could go back there.

24
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:09,250
[IZUMIKO] What?

25
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:10,750
[MIYUKI] Well...

26
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:13,375
I guess you could say I don't
miss it enough to go back.

27
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:16,291
I've never been able
to figure Yukimasa out...

28
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:18,708
but I think this whole situation
has cleared some things up

29
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:20,833
for me.

30
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:22,291
So tell me something...

31
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,541
Do you remember what
happened back in Tokyo...

32
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:25,916
with the Hime-gami and all?

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,333
Do I remember...?

34
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:29,958
Well, yes.

35
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:31,083
Except...

36
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:33,625
it doesn't feel like
it was me, you know...

37
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:36,458
It almost felt like
I was just a bystander...

38
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:39,625
I was there, but someone else
was doing all the talking.

39
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:41,708
[MIYUKI] That's more
than I expected...

40
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:44,125
It's actually pretty common
for people not to remember

41
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:45,875
what happens while
they're possessed.

42
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:47,625
[IZUMIKO] Wait, possessed?

43
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:48,958
[MIYUKI] That's what
it's called when a spirit

44
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:51,250
takes over your body.

45
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:52,458
He knows her...

46
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:55,000
Yukimasa knows that spirit.

47
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:56,791
The Hime-gami that
possessed you...

48
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:59,416
that's exactly what
he's been searching for.

49
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:03,291
[IZUMIKO] It's her he's
interested in protecting...

50
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:06,750
I'm not the one
he thinks is special.

51
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:08,625
[MIYUKI] It's probably best
if you try to think of her

52
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:09,833
as a different person.

53
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:11,083
Fine, all right, then...

54
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:13,458
Maybe I'm not the one
Yukimasa cares about...

55
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:15,958
So now can you please stop
giving me such a hard time

56
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:18,833
and saying that
I'm weak and useless?

57
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:24,833
This isn't something
to laugh about.

58
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:26,916
[MIYUKI] Yes...
of course, you're right.

59
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You don't need to worry
about that anymore...

60
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,166
Me teasing you...

61
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,083
I'll be transferring
to Tokyo soon.

62
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:33,291
[IZUMIKO] Tokyo?

63
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:34,916
[MIYUKI] Yeah.

64
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,666
That's where
Houjou Academy is...

65
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,541
It's the school Yukimasa
originally wanted to send me to.

66
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,541
I suspect there's something
about the school that may

67
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:45,250
benefit the Mountain Monks.

68
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:47,625
[IZUMIKO] Houjou Academy...

69
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:50,750
Father actually recommended
it to me, as well.

70
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,833
[MIYUKI] I'm not going to avoid
standing in the same ring

71
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,916
as Yukimasa anymore.

72
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,666
Someday I want to possess
the power of a Mountain Monk

73
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,291
in my own right.

74
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:04,125
[IZUMIKO] I wanted to attend
Sototsugawa High badly enough

75
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:06,458
to go against Father's wishes...

76
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:09,000
but now I don't remember why.

77
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,166
[AYUMI] She's here...!

78
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,375
Hey, Izumiko...!

79
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:18,750
You feeling better?

80
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:19,458
[IZUMIKO] Yeah.

81
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:20,583
[HARUNA] So listen...

82
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,916
there's something
we want to ask you.

83
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,833
[AYUMI] It actually
has to do with Wamiya.

84
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:26,791
[IZUMIKO] Oh...

85
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:27,166
Okay.

86
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,541
Sure.

87
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:29,958
[AYUMI] Well, to be honest,
he's a pretty quiet guy,

88
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:32,125
so it's easy for us to forget
about him sometimes...

89
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:35,208
We kind of feel bad about
ignoring him, so...

90
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:36,666
[MATSUBARA] Here!

91
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,000
[HARUNA] Do us a favor...

92
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:40,708
Give this souvenir to him
on everyone's behalf.

93
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:42,291
[AYUMI] It should be you.

94
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:43,625
After all, you were the first
one who noticed he wasn't there

95
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:44,708
on the field trip.

96
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,000
[HARUNA] Oh, and don't worry...

97
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:48,250
None of us are going
to fight you for him.

98
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:49,333
[IZUMIKO] What do you mean...?

99
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:50,916
Why would I want
to fight with you...?

100
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,583
[AYUMI] Oh, come on, get up your
courage and give it to him...

101
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:56,083
You can't fool us, we could
tell how sad you were that

102
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:58,750
he didn't come on the trip
with the rest of the class.

103
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,458
[IZUMIKO] Oh, um...

104
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:09,875
Hey, Wamiya!

105
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:13,333
For you...

106
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:15,125
It's from the girls.

107
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:17,458
Really...?

108
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:19,833
Wait, are you sure it's for me?

109
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:22,208
Yes. I hope
you'll accept it.

110
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,333
[IZUMIKO] It's a shame you
couldn't come on the field trip

111
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:30,333
with the rest of us, huh?

112
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:31,250
[WAMIYA] Yeah...

113
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,208
What about you?

114
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,000
Are you glad you went?

115
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,500
[IZUMIKO] Some parts of it
were difficult for me...

116
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,041
but still...

117
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:40,833
there were some other parts that
made going totally worth it.

118
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,666
[WAMIYA] Well...

119
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,583
I wish you hadn't gone.

120
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:46,250
[IZUMIKO] What?

121
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,125
[WAMIYA] That
city is corrupt...

122
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:49,166
tainted...

123
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,916
You shouldn't
have gone there...

124
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,791
You seem like a completely
different person

125
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,708
than before
you went.

126
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:55,125
Really?

127
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:57,166
I do?

128
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:00,291
You aren't planning to
leave this town, are you...?

129
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:03,625
I want you to tell me you don't
intend to go back to Tokyo.

130
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:07,458
[IZUMIKO] Why are you
saying stuff like that?

131
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:09,000
I'd like to
remind you...

132
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:12,208
It wasn't very long that ago
you told me you hated Sagara.

133
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:13,541
Well, I did then...

134
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:14,833
but now...

135
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,333
Now you've had
a change in heart.

136
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:28,000
If he is responsible
for what you've become...

137
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:30,916
I will have no choice
but to get rid of him.

138
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:36,166
[MIYUKI] Come on.

139
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,750
What's gotten into you guys?

140
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,916
[YOHEI] We decided we've
put up with you too damn long

141
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,083
and we're sick of it.

142
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:43,875
[TOMOYA] Yeah,
you've got a big, fat ego.

143
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:45,250
I thought I'd been
toning it down.

144
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:46,541
How embarrassing.

145
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:48,500
It's about time for us
to kick your sorry ass

146
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:49,833
outta this school...

147
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:53,000
Wamiya tells us you've
worn out your welcome.

148
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:53,708
Wamiya?

149
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:54,666
Never heard of the guy.

150
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,041
Shut your mouth!

151
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,458
[MIYUKI is punched]

152
00:06:58,541 --> 00:06:59,666
All right...

153
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,333
Just remember,
you threw the first punch~

154
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:10,166
So what, is this Wamiya
guy behind all of this...?

155
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:10,791
Where is he?

156
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:12,166
Lemme talk to him!

157
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,750
You're crazy.

158
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,458
[KAZUTO] We told you to leave.

159
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:24,083
[WAMIYA throu KAZUTO] You're
nothing more than scum...

160
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:27,500
And scum doesn't belong here.

161
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,750
[NONOMURA] Purify the
six roots of perception,

162
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:32,250
cleansing the heart
of all that taints it.

163
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:39,875
Are you all right...?

164
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,666
Any wounds?

165
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:47,208
Oh, no, Miyuki!

166
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:49,458
[MIYUKI] It's nothing serious.

167
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:51,875
[NONOMURA] It was
just as Izumiko said.

168
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,250
[IZUMIKO] You got into
a fight with Wamiya?

169
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:57,041
Who's this
Wamiya guy, anyway?

170
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:58,333
What do you mean,
who is he?

171
00:07:58,416 --> 00:07:59,375
He's Wamiya...

172
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:02,625
Satoru Wamiya,
a classmate of ours.

173
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:04,708
Well, I've never
heard of the kid.

174
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,958
What are you
talking about?

175
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:08,875
[MIYUKI] Roll call
every morning...

176
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:11,791
Since I'm a transfer student,
my name comes at the very end,

177
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:14,250
after all the W's
have been called.

178
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,666
There aren't any
students named Wamiya.

179
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,541
[IZUMIKO] That's impossible!

180
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:20,791
[NONOMURA] Izumiko.

181
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,250
How did you know about this?

182
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,208
What made you think something
bad was going to happen

183
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:26,291
to Miyuki?

184
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,375
[IZUMIKO] I spoke to Wamiya,
and he didn't seem like

185
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,500
his usual self.

186
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,708
[IZUMIKO] He was saying
something about...

187
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:33,791
well...

188
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:35,583
getting rid of you, Miyuki.

189
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:35,958
Really?

190
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:36,958
Why?

191
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:37,958
Well, it's um...

192
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:39,875
it's difficult
to explain, but...

193
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:43,291
a while ago I sort of told
Wamiya that I hated you.

194
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:45,000
And why would you
tell him that?

195
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:45,916
Because at the
time you were

196
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,750
being really
mean to me!

197
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:48,958
Make sure
you're buckled in.

198
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:50,333
I have to floor it.

199
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:52,666
Something is coming after us.

200
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,583
And it isn't human.

201
00:08:58,083 --> 00:08:58,708
What is it?

202
00:08:58,791 --> 00:08:59,791
Is something
out there?

203
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:02,041
Wait, you mean you
really can't see it?

204
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:03,875
[MIYUKI] No...

205
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,333
It just feels like
something's...

206
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:06,250
off...

207
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:07,708
You, Nonomura?

208
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,958
[NONOMURA] I see spiritual
energy converging...

209
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:12,375
It may be a divine spirit.

210
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:13,833
I think that
classmate of yours

211
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:15,416
is no mere boy.

212
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,833
He seems to possess the power
to control the other students.

213
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:20,416
[IZUMIKO] Okay, then...

214
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,125
what does he want from us?

215
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:23,875
[NONOMURA] If he is
a divine spirit...

216
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:27,166
They are known to curse
as well as bless.

217
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,375
As to 'why'...

218
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:30,208
It can be impossible for
a human to know what

219
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,625
will incur their wrath.

220
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:35,208
Now you've had a
change of heart.

221
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:36,458
There's more
to all this than

222
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:37,416
we thought
at first...

223
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,291
It isn't just
you he's mad at.

224
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:41,875
He's angry with me...

225
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:43,208
and it's because
of me that he's

226
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,208
directed that
anger toward you.

227
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:46,916
Could you be
a bit more specific?

228
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,833
It's because
I went to Tokyo.

229
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:50,208
What, for the fieldtrip?

230
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,500
[NONOMURA] I don't think I can
lose him, but I should be able

231
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:56,625
to get us to the
shrine, at least.

232
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:58,500
We must try to make it inside...

233
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,791
The divine protection the
shrine bestows may give us

234
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,333
a fighting chance.

235
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:12,458
[metal crashing against metal]

236
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,541
[MIYUKI] Suzuhara...

237
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,583
you still alive?

238
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:22,500
Are you hurt...?

239
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:23,958
Did you break anything?

240
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:26,750
[IZUMIKO] I'm pretty sore,
but I'll survive.

241
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:29,166
[NONOMURA] No serious
injuries, that's good.

242
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:32,833
I want both of you to get
out of the car carefully.

243
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:34,958
Look out for
gasoline leaks.

244
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:37,958
[IZUMIKO] Nonomura?

245
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:40,166
Y-You're bleeding!

246
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,750
[NONOMURA] I'll be fine.

247
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:44,750
But it does look like it will
take a while for me to get out.

248
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:46,166
What do I do?!

249
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,000
[NONOMURA] Above all,
you must not lose heart.

250
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,958
This is the way of things.

251
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:53,500
Everyone close to the Hime-gami
is expected to risk their lives

252
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:54,666
to protect her...

253
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:55,500
Miyuki...

254
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:57,625
that goes for you, as well.

255
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,666
Tengu mountain deities
can be both protective

256
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,000
and destructive.

257
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:03,708
[WAMIYA] Speculating about
my nature now, are we?

258
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,333
[MIYUKI]
You're Wamiya.

259
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:09,625
Is that right?

260
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:11,875
[WAMIYA] So you can
finally see me, then...

261
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:14,458
What do I look like?

262
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:16,000
Nothing special...

263
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:18,458
Just like a normal
middle schooler.

264
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:21,958
That's because I am
a normal middle school boy.

265
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,791
Well, at any rate...

266
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:27,500
That's what I am for as long
as Suzuhara wants me to be.

267
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:29,250
[IZUMIKO] I don't understand...

268
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:30,458
It's so strange.

269
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:32,166
I was convinced I'd
known you for years--

270
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,375
ever since elementary school.

271
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:36,916
[WAMIYA] I've always been
with you in some way...

272
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,625
Throughout elementary school...

273
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:40,583
and before.

274
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:41,875
Think carefully...

275
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:43,750
When did you first
begin to see me...?

276
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:47,833
It was right after you cut
your bangs, wasn't it?

277
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:51,250
I've existed on this
mountain since ancient times.

278
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:53,958
Parts of me were drifting
about, devoid of form.

279
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:56,791
Until they converged
around Suzuhara's wish,

280
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,875
creating the shape you see now.

281
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:00,125
I made a wish...?

282
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:02,666
I don't remember.

283
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,375
You wished desperately
for a friend, didn't you...?

284
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,625
Somebody who would
truly understand you.

285
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:11,166
I refuse to let you
pretend otherwise.

286
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:14,375
After all, it was that
wish that gave me substance.

287
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:17,500
And I won't let you say
you no longer need me, either.

288
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:24,750
[NONOMURA] Miyuki...

289
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:26,083
Get my staff...

290
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:28,041
It's in the trunk of the car.

291
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:30,000
You must use it!

292
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,000
I can't...

293
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,541
I don't know how.

294
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,791
[NONOMURA] This
spirit is dangerous.

295
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:36,541
He possesses true power...

296
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:39,500
He could kill all of us!

297
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:42,791
Do you actually think
you'll be able to exorcise me?

298
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:53,166
[WAMIYA] This mountain
forest is my sanctuary.

299
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:57,458
[NONOMURA] Hurry, Miyuki...!

300
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:58,875
Get the staff!

301
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:00,083
I can't...

302
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:02,500
I'm not that far along
in my training, yet!

303
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,666
This isn't the time
for self-doubt...

304
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,833
Accept the situation.

305
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:07,375
You have no choice.

306
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:09,291
But I do accept it...

307
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:11,083
That's why I'm so sure...

308
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:12,708
I can't do this!

309
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:16,083
[WAMIYA] You are going
to remain here and attend

310
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:18,791
Sototsugawa High School with me.

311
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:21,500
From now on, everybody
will treat you kindly...

312
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,833
I'll see to that.

313
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:25,083
Well, but...

314
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:27,041
what if I told you that
I'd changed my mind...?

315
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:29,291
What would
happen to us then?

316
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:32,375
[WAMIYA] I'm afraid that
is not one of your options.

317
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,833
If you say that you
intend to abandon me...

318
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:44,208
I'll simply bring a bolt of
lightning crashing down upon us.

319
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,958
[MIYUKI] Wouldn't doing
that defeat your purpose...?

320
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:48,833
I thought you wanted
to help Suzuhara...

321
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:50,458
not hurt her.

322
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:53,708
[WAMIYA] She must pay the
price for using my power.

323
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:58,083
[MIYUKI] Suzuhara...

324
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:59,083

326
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,875
Are you telling me to give in
to the spirit's demands?

327
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:05,666
That's the only way
out of this...!

328

You heard
what he said.

329
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:08,250
He's gonna kill us
if you don't...!

330
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:11,083
Remember, he's the divine
spirit of the mountain!

331
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,875
[IZUMIKO] How could you
say something like that?!

332
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:25,083
What happened to
the Miyuki I used to know?

333
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:27,375

yourself for once...!

00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:31,708
How can you be so selfish?!

336
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:35,083
If you were truly made from my
wish, then bow to my will...!

337
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,916
Never threaten me
like this again!

338
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,125
Do you understand, Wamiya?

339
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:42,375
Leave us alone!

340
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,041
[WAMIYA] And if I refuse...?

341
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:45,916
What then?

342
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,041
Then I will grow
to despise you...

343
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:49,791
Imagine what
that will be like...

344
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:52,875
I won't ever come to visit
this mountain anymore...

345
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,458
Is that really what you want?

346
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:56,875
[WAMIYA] What does it matter
if you despise me or not...?

347
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:59,625
You are going to be leaving
the mountain in any case.

348
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:01,166
That may be so...

349
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,708
but wouldn't it be better if
we parted ways as friends...?

350
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:05,750
Just think about it
and you'll see.

351
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:26,250
[MIYUKI] Hey...

352
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,250
Suzuhara!

353
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:31,916
[IZUMIKO] I'll be fine...

354
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,250
I'm just relieved, that's all.

355
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:40,125
[NONOMURA] If I had
to guess, I'd say Wamiya

356
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:42,375
was probably a familiar.

357
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:43,583
[MIYUKI] What do you mean?

358
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:45,916
[NONOMURA] The
Hime-gami's familiar.

359
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,333
A divine servant who
serves a divine master.

360
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:50,791
While Izumiko
was still unaware

361
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:53,375
of their relationship, the
spirit's powers began to run

362
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:56,833
out of control, becoming
obsessive and dangerous.

363
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:59,875
But she locked him into the true
master-servant relationship

364
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:02,000
just in time.

365
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:04,208
You were magnificent!

366
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,750
[IZUMIKO] In other words...

367
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:11,208
I was both Wamiya's creator
and his destroyer, wasn't I?

368
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:13,291
There is no need
to mourn his loss...

369
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,875
It isn't as though Wamiya
no longer exists...

370
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:19,625
He is probably waiting to form
a new relationship with you.

371
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:26,750
[MIYUKI] When did you decide you
wanted to go to Houjou Academy?

372
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:29,000
[IZUMIKO] I didn't know I had
made up my mind until Wamiya

373
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:31,166
brought it up.

374
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,208
He realized it before
I did and he told me

375
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,291
not to go...

376
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:36,291
I guess that's why...

377
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:37,500
Wait, hold on a second.

378
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,083
Let me see if
I've got this straight...

379
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:41,166
Nonomura and I nearly
got killed...

380
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,208
because you changed your mind
about what school you liked?

381
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:45,916
He was going to
kill me, too,

382
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,208
so I would say
that makes us

383
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:48,291
about even...

384
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,000
and don't forget,
Miyuki, I was the

385
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,708
one who stopped
him in the end.

386
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:54,625
[MIYUKI] It was
all because of her...

387
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:57,958
I didn't realize just how
dangerous the Hime-gami was.

388
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:00,958
Anyway...

389
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:03,125
Seems like I've got
a lot of work to do...

390
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:04,583
I'm gonna train hard...

391
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:07,625
so her little pet can't
get the best of me again.

392
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:09,166
So does that mean
you've decided to

393
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,083
become a Mountain
Monk, after all?

394
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:12,791
I'm gonna
try to, anyway...

395
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:14,125
I'm betting
Houjou Academy

396
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:15,625
is a great
place to start.

397
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:17,541
I know you're nervous,
but I think it'll be a good

398

tell you what it's like.

Thank you...

402
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:27,708
I really appreciate that.

00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:30,250
[WAMIYA] Could you do one
thing for me before you go?

404
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:34,500
I would like for us
to have a proper farewell.

Please release me from
my form as Satoru Wamiya...

need him with you anymore.

Yes, of course, but...

to do that?

[WAMIYA] Think about it...

412

Don't you often dance on the top
of the mountain by yourself...?

413
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:54,083
The dance that bound me should
also be able to release me.

414
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:55,416
It was my dance?

415
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,541
Wait, do you mean...

416
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:57,958
you mean you bound him
without even knowing

417
00:17:58,041 --> 00:17:59,250
what you were doing?

418
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:00,833
Yeah, I guess so...

419
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:03,500
I do dance sometimes, but it's
just supposed to be a workout.

421
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,583
Well, I guess I can't see any
reason for him to lie to us.

422
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,916
Your dancing actually
controlled the divine spirit

423
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,041
of the mountain.

424
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:12,458
[WAMIYA] That's right.

425
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:14,625
Now, will you please do me
the honor of releasing me

426
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:16,458
by performing a dance?

427
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:21,500
[MIYUKI] Uh...

428
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:23,750
why are you wearing that?

429
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:26,416
[IZUMIKO] I guess I didn't
really have to change...

430
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,291
but it's easier to dance when
I have the right sleeves.

00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:30,416
And it's okay...?

432

you don't mind if
I stay and watch?

433
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:34,250
[IZUMIKO] Of course, I can't
think of what difference

434
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:37,458
it will make if I show
two people instead of one.

[IZUMIKO] Now that
I think about it...

I really was yearning to have
somebody in my life who could

understand me as I do myself.

00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:39,750
I was fine
coming here this time.

478
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:40,833
Oh yeah...?

479
00:23:40,916 --> 00:23:42,583
Well, that's certainly
good to hear.

480
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:44,166
I'm glad.

481
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:47,791
[MIYUKI] When the new
trimester starts up...

482
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:50,041
don't tell anybody
about your hometown...

483
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:51,583
or your powers.

484
00:23:51,666 --> 00:23:54,916
[IZUMIKO] I hadn't planned on
it, but why do you say that?

485
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,916
[MIYUKI] You didn't have to take
the entrance exam, right...?

486
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,041
From what I understand,
there aren't very many people

487
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:01,958
who are excused from taking it.

488
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:03,000
Okay...

489
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:05,375
so why was I exempted, then?

490
00:24:05,458 --> 00:24:07,416
Just think about
it for a second.

491
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:15,208
[MIYUKI] Houjou Academy
is no ordinary school...

492
00:24:15,291 --> 00:24:16,708
If it was...

493
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:19,666
why would both Daisei and
Yukimasa be so interested in it?

494
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:37,916
Hello?

495
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,166
[GIRL] Hey...!

496
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:41,833
Are you Suzuhara?

497
00:24:41,916 --> 00:24:43,875
My name's Mayura Souda.

498
00:24:45,125 --> 00:24:47,291
You're so cute...! I mean it!

499
00:24:47,375 --> 00:24:49,250
You are just adorable!

500
00:24:49,333 --> 00:24:52,208
I had no idea I would
get such a cute roommate!

501
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:53,833
I'm so lucky!

502
00:24:53,916 --> 00:24:55,625
[IZUMIKO] I, uh...

503
00:25:02,958 --> 00:25:05,666
[IZUMIKO] Oh, Miyuki, I didn't
realize you knew Mayura.
