00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:47,583
She only possesses you when
she has something dire to say.

165
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,291
It sounds like you
would rather spend time with

166
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:52,291
the Hime-gami than with me.

167
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:53,875
I never said that...!

168
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:55,916
If I wanted to keep you as the
Hime-gami do you really think

169
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,125
I would have gone with her
to the castle ruins and fought

170
00:07:58,208 --> 00:07:59,416
to bring you back?

171
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,625
That's right.

172
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,083
You went out on a date
with her, didn't you...?

173
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:03,833
There was a little
spark there, huh?

174
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:04,875
What's wrong with you?

175
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:06,875
Why are you going off
on me like this?

176
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,375
Just forget it!

177
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:10,750
Mayura understands how I feel
a lot better than you do.

178
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:11,541
Whoa, hold on.

179
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:12,708
What do you mean by that...?

180
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:13,833
You didn't tell her about--

181
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:15,291
So you know...

182
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:16,750
I don't really appreciate
listening to you talk about

183
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:18,875
other girls.

184
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:20,125
[HIME-GAMI] Enough of this.

185
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,541
I do not like it when
you speak of other women

186
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:24,083
[MIYUKI] Suzuhara...

187
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:26,333
have you ever considered that
you and the Hime-gami might

188
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:28,583
have more in common
than you think...?

189
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:29,958
That you're the same?

190
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:32,666
What are you talking about?

191
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,041
It's prob'ly nothing...

192
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:35,708
Just forget it.

193
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:38,041
[KISARAGI] Having the parade
without the princess?

194
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:40,916
I suspect Hayakawa would
be less than pleased.

195
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,958
[REINA] Keep in mind our
foremost obligation is

196
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,791
to respect the
participants' wishes.

197
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,541
[KISARAGI] Yes,
you have a point...

198
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:47,916
Moving on.

199
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,375
Five people have gotten
sick in the Horror House...

200
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:52,791
and all five happened
just this morning.

201
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:55,333
They're recuperating
in the infirmary.

202
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:56,291
What is going on?

203
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:57,958
Did they make it
too frightening?

204
00:08:58,041 --> 00:08:58,833
No.

205
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:00,041
We checked it
out earlier,

206
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,750
and it seems like they
kept it fairly tame.

207
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,583
[KISARAGI] I'm not sure I can
trust your opinion on that.

208
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:05,625
Yeah...?!

209
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:06,875
Then go check it
out for yourself.

210
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:07,416
You'll see--

211
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,958
No way in hell!

212
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:14,000
If you want...

213
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,916
I could go and
investigate.

214
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,083
Oh, really...?

215
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:19,333
I'd appreciate that,
thank you very much.

216
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:20,666
Damn Sagara...

217
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,916
Why couldn't I play the
role of the hero for once?

218
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,541
So the Prez is majorly
scared of ghosts, huh?

219
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:27,625
I'll talk to the middle
schoolers about the parade.

220
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:29,375
Maybe I can talk
some sense into them.

221
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:31,583
[KISARAGI] We've got the right
people on the right jobs...

222
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:32,833
Thanks, guys.

223
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:35,000
[MAYURA] The only people getting
sick in the Haunted House

224
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:36,458
are girls and women...?

225
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:38,583
Something doesn't seem
right about this...

226
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,375
There's that
"curse" thing, too...

227
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,000
[MIYUKI] Think it's Takayanagi?

228
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:44,416
[MAYURA] It's too soon to say.

229
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,583
Sagara!

230
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:49,250
Be sure to keep an
eye on Izumiko, okay?

231
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:50,541
Yeah...

232
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:51,500
Let's go.

233
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:57,416
I'll go.

234
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,333
You wait outside...

235
00:09:58,416 --> 00:09:58,916
Okay?

236
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,583
What...?

237
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:00,875
Why?

238
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:02,500
We know something
strange is going on here...

239
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:03,916
There's no need to take risks...

240
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,041
I'll be back.

241
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:34,041
[BOY 1] Hey...

242
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:35,625
Suzuhara?

243
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,083
[BOY 1] Yeah,
I thought it was you...!

244
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:38,333
Do...

245
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:39,375
you mind if I take your
picture really quick...?

246
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:40,458
Like to remember you by?

247
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:41,125
[IZUMIKO] Huh...?

248
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:41,833
Um, I--

249
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:43,416
[BOY 2] Please?

250
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,333
It's not asking too much to let
my buddy get his photo with you.

251
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:46,833
[BOY 1] Nah man,
I don't actually need to be

252
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:48,041
in it with her.

253
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,833
I just want a shot of
her to send to my folks.

254
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,458
[BOY 1] You looked
great as the princess

255
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:52,375
at the demo.

256
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,000
But this has its own charm.

257
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:56,166
I have some work to
do for the Executive Committee.

258
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,166
I have to go!

259
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,041
[BOY 1]
Please, wait a sec!

260
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:06,333
Why did they
want my picture...?

261
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,583
I could understand
if it was Mayura.

262
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,250
[GIRL screams]

263
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,458
Scary!

264
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:18,916
Let's keep going.

265
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,458
[FEMALE GHOST 1]
It's you, Milady...

266
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:00,750
Oh, thank goodness...!

267
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,583
We couldn't find you.

268
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:03,625
[FEMALE GHOST 2]
We need to hurry...!

269
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:04,708
Please, Milady!

270
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,041
[FEMALE GHOST 3]
We haven't much time...!

271
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,333
The enemy will be
here any moment!

272
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:11,583
[FEMALE GHOST 4]
Quickly, please!

273
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:12,500
Come with us.

274
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:13,125
[FEMALE GHOST 5]
This is the way!

275
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:13,958
Leave me alone!

276
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,416
I don't want to go with you!

277
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,500
[FEMALE GHOST 1]
If only Ojtero were here...

278
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,875
[FEMALE GHOST 3] Then this
never would have come to pass.

279
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:21,750
What are you
talking about...?

280
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:23,541
Please let me go!

281
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:34,333
[FEMALE GHOSTS]
Please, Milady!

282
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:36,625
Hurry, Milady!

283
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:37,958
You must hurry!

284
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:39,916
Please, Milady!

285
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,416
Hurry, Milady!

286
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,541
You must hurry!

287
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,000
Sagara!

288
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:44,958
Milady, this way!

289
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:46,458
Milady!

290
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:48,000
[IZUMIKO] Is it really you?

291
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:51,791
 Help, Sagara!

292
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:55,958
[MAN]
I've got you now.

293
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:07,875
[IZUMIKO screams]

294
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:09,125
[MIYUKI] What's
going on in here?

295
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:12,000
[IZUMIKO cries]

296
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,708
[MAN]
Uh, sorry, man.

297
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:17,291
[MIYUKI] Okay, what did you see
while you were in there...?

298
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:19,583
I'm not mad at you
for blowing me off...

299
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:20,916
Just tell me.

300
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,041
I'm pretty sure I had
my first ghost encounter.

301
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,000
And you didn't defend
yourself, did you...?

302
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,666
I taught you that
technique so you'd use it.

303
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,333
[IZUMIKO] I could tell they
went through something awful.

304
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:33,000
I felt bad.

305
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,625
Unbelievable...

306
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:38,250
May you be healed.

307
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:40,500
May the spiritual wounds
you've suffered be repaired.

308
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:43,500
What was that chant?

309
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:45,583
[MIYUKI] A Mudra, it'll
help you feel better...

310
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:48,125
I hope so, anyway.

311
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:49,250
Well, thank you...

312
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,041
I think I can feel it working.

313
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:52,875
[MIYUKI] Let's go
to the infirmary.

314
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:53,750
But why?

315
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,208
I'm really doing a lot better.

316
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:57,375
I didn't say we were
going there for you...

317
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:59,083
We have
investigating to do.

318
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:05,041
What the heck's
going on here?

319
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:07,083
[IZUMIKO] I think
I might know...

320
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:14,083
Please excuse me for a moment.

321
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:16,166
[MIYUKI] I should've known...

322
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,958
You really are a disgusting
specimen of humanity.

323
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:19,833
I'm volunteering.

324
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:20,833
Is that so bad?

325
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:22,416
[MIYUKI] Don't
give me that crap!

326
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:25,291
You've been crying,
haven't you...?

327
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:25,833
Why?

328
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:26,416
What happened?

329
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,875
Its nothing I uh

330
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:28,583
What?

331
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:29,583
Was it Miyuki's fault?

332
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:31,041
No, of course not...!

333
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:33,500
I was just a little
startled, that's all.

334
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:34,708
We were at the Horror House,

335
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,791
and I saw what I think
were ghosts, so...

336
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:37,875
In other words...

337
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:39,375
You encountered
something frightening,

338
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,625
and Miyuki was
no help whatsoever.

339
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,500
[IZUMIKO] No, you've
got it wrong...

340
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:44,666
It was my fault.

341
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,000
I didn't think
they meant me any harm...

342
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:49,291
Now I know I didn't
handle the situation well.

343
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:50,833
[YUKIMASA] Listen
to me carefully...

344
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:53,750
You must avoid blindly
sympathizing with ghosts...

345
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:56,541
I assure you, no good
will come out of it.

346
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:58,500
What do you mean?

347
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:00,333
[YUKIMASA] I mean, don't
go around feeling sorry

348
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:02,291
for dead people.

349
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,083
The Heavens look
upon the Earth...

350
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:06,375
Sympathy from above.

351
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,625
[IZUMIKO] What is this?

352
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:16,500
[YUKIMASA] We don't want
a halfwit protecting

353
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,291
the Hime-gami.

354
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,250
You think you can get
away with anything you want

355
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:22,000
so long as you say
it's necessary to

356
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:24,625
"protect the Hime-gami."
You really make me sick!

357
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:26,291
The wise man
makes use of every

358
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:27,833
opportunity he gets...

359
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:31,333
She will be highly guarded when
she enters the public eye...

360
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:33,791
You will only be allowed to
interact with Izumiko while

361
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:35,916
she is attending this academy.

362
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,916
What are you talking
about, Sagara...?

363
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,916
That totally contradicts
what you said the other day.

364
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,375
You told me the
Hime-gami chose Miyuki.

365
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,875
[YUKIMASA] Sometimes she has
to reconsider her choices...

366
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:48,291
It's not as though she can
see everything, after all.

367
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:51,041
[IZUMIKO] And all of this
is according to who?

368
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:52,875
According to Yukariko.

369
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:57,416
Don't worry.

370
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,375
You go ahead
and leave.

371
00:15:58,458 --> 00:15:59,500
I'll protect Izumiko.

372
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,041
Stop messing
with his head.

373
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:03,250
Someday you're going
to push him too far!

374
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:08,875
[IZUMIKO] Come back!

375
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,958
 Please just talk to me!

376
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:15,125
I completely understand
why you're angry...

377
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,625
and I'm sorry...

378
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:19,083
I know it's my fault that
Sagara said all that stuff...

379
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:21,250
He was being a total jerk.

380
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:24,791
Please, I don't want you
to avoid me because of it.

381
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:27,458
I'm not avoiding you.

382
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:29,666
It's obvious to me
what he's doing...

383
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,583
Even so...

384
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,416
he still pisses me off.

385
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:36,250
[MIYUKI] What are you doing?

386
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:39,125
[IZUMIKO] I'm just so relieved
that you're not mad at me.

387
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,416
[MIYUKI] You know,
you really are different

388
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,916
than the Hime-gami...

389
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,541
I wonder why that is.

390
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:46,166
I don't think I'm the
one to ask about that.

391
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,666
[MIYUKI] Neither is Yukimasa.

392
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,666
He doesn't know you
all that well...

393
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,125
He doesn't...

394
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:53,875
but with all we've been
through, I certainly do by now.

395
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:58,041
I'll have to
give it some thought.

396
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:16,875
[HAYAKAWA] I knew it was
coming but it still sucks.

397
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,416
Any race is more
entertaining when

398
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,416
the dark horse wins it,
but I just haven't had any

399
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,416
luck there today.

400
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,875
[KISARAGI] Hayakawa!

401
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:26,333
I would like you to explain,
clearly and completely,

402
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:29,041
why you were offering bets
on the poll outcomes.

403
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:30,416
Oh, you heard
about that?

404
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,125
I hear about
a lot, yes.

405
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:33,458
Technically,
it wasn't betting.

406
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:34,958
They were
popularity forecasts.

407
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:37,250
I'm allowed to have a little
fun sometimes, aren't I?

408
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:38,791
[KISARAGI] You're
not here to have fun...

409
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:40,625
[IZUMIKO] Huh. It looks like
Class 1-A got the highest score

410
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:42,625
in the booth division.

411
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,166
[MAYURA] Great job, everyone.

412
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,583
[REINA] Hey Souda,
how was the parade?

413
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:49,083
[MAYURA] The tail end of it just
reached the school grounds...

414
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:50,833
and it went off without a hitch.

415
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:52,333
[KISARAGI] Wonderful!

416
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:56,208
And now, it's time for me
to announce the results!

417
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:58,250
Congratulations!

418
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:00,166
Your class's booth
came out on top.

419
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,000
Which means that pretty
much everyone's attention

420
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:03,500
is now on Takayanagi...

421
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,583
He is the one who
conceptualized, organized,

422
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:07,125
and ran the booth.

423
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:10,625
I was well aware of
the risks when I chose

424
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:12,291
the Executive Committee...

425
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,708
Still, I can't help but feel
like I drew the short straw

426
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,125
this time around.

427
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:18,333
He'll only be favored by
other members of your class,

428
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:19,333
though, right?

429
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:20,958
It's hard to say...

430
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:22,625
It could still
go much further...

431
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:25,541
I imagine he'll be chosen to
serve as the main army's general

432
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:26,916
for the mock battle.

433
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,500
[BOY 3] Hey, Souda!

434
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:30,000
If you don't mind...

435
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:31,875
could you please accompany me
to the Broadcasting booth?

436
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:32,333
Me...?

437
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:33,666
What for?

438
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:34,875
[BOY 3] The Director
probably has some questions

439
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:36,125
about the parade...

440
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:38,416
Suzuhara's welcome
to tag along if she wants.

441
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:41,375
[HAYAKAWA] Well, Souda...

442
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:43,125
The parade presented by
the middle school students

443
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:44,666
was amazing...

444
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,833
It truly made this feel like
a Warring States Festival...!

445
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:49,333
That's obvious from
all the points it earned

446
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,083
in the popularity poll!

447
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:53,250
[MAYURA] Our visitors were
delighted by the parade.

448
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,208
The middle school students
did a great job!

449
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:56,375
[HAYAKAWA] Incidentally...

450
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:58,208
I hear you're
extremely popular among

451
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:00,208
the middle school
girls, Souda...

452
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:01,916
In fact, they see
you as a role model.

453
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
[MAYURA] Really?

454
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:04,750
And who told you that?

455
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,833
I know this might be
a little sudden...

456
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:10,166
but the middle schoolers have a
very special favor to ask you...

457
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,500
They're going to be joining
us here in just a moment.

458
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:13,416
[MAYURA] Huh?

459
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:17,875
[MIDDLE SCHOOL GIRL 3]
We wanted to say thank you

460
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,833
for all your help
with the parade today.

461
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:21,208
[MIDDLE SCHOOL GIRL 2] And...

462
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:23,041
We also wanted to ask
if you'd consider serving as

463
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:25,500
the Princess General for the
middle school's defending army

464
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,041
in tomorrow's mock battle.

465
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,625
[ALL]
Please say you will!

466
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:29,833
Hey, hold on a second...!

467
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:32,375
I can't agree to
something like this here!

468
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:34,041
But it's such
an interesting twist!

469
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:36,458
[MAYURA] I'm a member of
the Executive Committee!

470
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:37,958
I'm well aware...

471
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:40,791
But the princess simply must
be represented in the game.

472
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:42,208
If she isn't...

473
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:45,291
that will affect the integrity
of the entire festival!

474
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:46,750
I suppose
Suzuhara can do it

475
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:48,708
if you aren't willing to.

476
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:49,708
I see what you're doing,

477
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:51,083
so don't drag her into this.

478
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:52,458
I'll be the princess.

479
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:53,833
[HAYAKAWA] Did you
hear that, folks...?

480
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:55,458
There's one more
thing to look forward

481
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:57,125
to in tomorrow's battle...!

482
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:58,291
This broadcast
was brought to you

483
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,916
by Festival Director
Yoshiki Hayakawa.

484
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:07,166
It's like before
with Kisaragi...

485
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:10,375
Is there anything scarier than
a pretty lady when she's angry?

486
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:13,083
I would appreciate an
explanation for this...

487
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:14,666
Right now.

488
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,791
If anything, I think
my actions should have earned

489
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:22,041
your gratitude, not your anger.

490
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:24,250
[MAYURA] Why exactly
should I be grateful?

491
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:26,583
Because I can
see the future...

492
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:29,125
I know who will control
the main army tomorrow...

493
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:31,875
Ichijou Takayanagi.

494
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:33,291
Given that...

495
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:35,291
wouldn't serving as the
general of the defending army

496
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:37,125
be the best position for you?

497
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:40,500
[MAYURA] No way...

498
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:42,458
it can't be...

499
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,250
[HAYAKAWA] Oh yes it can

500
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:45,625
[MAYURA] Ah...!

501
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:47,583
You pulled a fast one on me...!

502
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:49,500
That was very
sneaky of my father.

503
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,041
[IZUMIKO] Your father?

504
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,333
 Wait, does that mean...?

505
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:56,541
Are you actually from
Togakushi, Director Hayakawa?

506
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:00,208
This is the first time
I've understood the saying,

507
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:02,375
"If you want to deceive the
enemy, you should start by

508
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:04,166
deceiving your allies."

509
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,291
But deception or not, thank you.

510
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:07,416
You are now officially

511
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,208
the Princess General, Souda...

512
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:10,166
That said...

513
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:13,000
all I can do is set the stage.

514
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:14,625
Your opponent has
surely set some sort

515
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,458
of trap on campus...

516
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:17,458
Be careful.

517
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:19,041
Oh, I will be.

518
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:29,416
[IZUMIKO] Mayura...?

519
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,458
Isn't it exciting
that you're going to--

520
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,250
Masumi?!

521
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:35,875
Guil-ty!

522
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:37,583
[IZUMIKO] What are
you doing here...?

523
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:40,541
Mayura and Manatsu
haven't summoned you yet.

524
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:41,958
Whether they
summon me or not,

525
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:43,750
I am always there with them...

526
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:46,125
You look cute with
your hair like that.

527
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:47,833
Sorry, I can't help myself.

528
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:50,916
When I see you, I get the
uncontrollable urge to flirt!

529
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,708
You haven't changed
a bit since Togakushi...!

530
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:55,416
Does that mean that
your relationship with

531
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,583
Mayura and Manatsu is
still the same as ever, too?

532
00:21:58,666 --> 00:21:59,583
I don't understand.

533
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:01,166
What do you mean by that?

534
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,541
[IZUMIKO] Do you still
love them like you did

535
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:03,833
before what happened?

536
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:04,708
[MASUMI] Oh...

537
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:05,916
I think I get it.

538
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,541
[IZUMIKO] It's easy
to understand, really...

539
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,083
When we love somebody...

540
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:10,416
we want to be around them.

541
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,916
We want to know about them
and how they're doing.

542
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:17,458
Suzuhara, do you
have a boyfriend?

543
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:18,416
No, I don't...

544
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,958
Why do you ask?

545
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:21,416
Help me
with something...

546
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,791
Let's say I found some wandering
souls, and I thought...

547
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:25,125
"They can't stay like this.

548
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:26,375
They're suffering.

549
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:28,458
They would be better off
if I consumed them."...

550
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:31,208
That would count as
a type of love, right?

551
00:22:31,291 --> 00:22:32,791
[IZUMIKO] I'm not so sure 

552
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:35,041
[MASUMI] If I accept them and
offer to become one with them,

553
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:37,250
doesn't that say something
about how I feel...?

554
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:39,958
Doesn't it mean I love
them after a fashion?

555
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:41,583
I guess, maybe...

556
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:43,958
If you're welcoming them into
yourself out of compassion

557
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:47,291
for their suffering, I suppose
that could be seen as love.

558
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:48,875
[MASUMI] That's
good to hear...!

559
00:22:48,958 --> 00:22:50,666
I'm glad I had
that right...

560
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,333
I was having a really hard
time following Mayura...

561
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:55,041
but I feel much
better now.

562
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:56,375
[IZUMIKO] Mayura?

563
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,083
There was dissonance
between us...

564
00:22:58,166 --> 00:23:00,041
but now I think
it was nothing big.

565
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:02,250
What do you mean
by dissonance?

566
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:05,208
[MASUMI] Isn't Shinkou coming
over for a strategy meeting...?

567
00:23:05,291 --> 00:23:07,375
I should take off for now.

568
00:23:07,458 --> 00:23:09,083
When the other two
summon me, I like to make

569
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:10,125
a grand entrance.

570
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:11,791
It's more fun that way...

571
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:13,166
One more thing...

572
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:15,833
I can sense the presence
of a curse here on campus...

573
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:16,833
but don't you worry.

574
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:18,583
I can disperse it
quickly enough.

575
00:23:18,666 --> 00:23:19,291
Wait, Masumi!

576
00:23:19,375 --> 00:23:20,958
A curse?

577
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:33,416
♪

578
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:00,875
[IZUMIKO] Please stay away...

579
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:02,500
You have to...

580
00:25:02,583 --> 00:25:04,333
or we're all doomed.
