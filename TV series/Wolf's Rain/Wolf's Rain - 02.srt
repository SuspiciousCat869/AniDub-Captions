belongs to you?

158
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,583
That beautiful--

159
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:10,583
Uh, yeah! Yeah, he's mine!

160
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:12,208
But how'd you know about it?

161
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:15,625
Um, I... I heard it from
the lady at the store.

162
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:16,916
What's a name anyway?

163
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,125
A name?

164
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:19,208
[chuckles]

165
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:20,791
The name is Toboe.

166
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,250
Toboe?

167
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:24,083
[chuckles] What a weird name.

168
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:27,541
You think so?
Yeah, I guess it is.

169
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:29,958
My name is Leara.
What's yours?

170
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,791
I just said. It's Toboe.

171
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,541
I thought that was
your dog's name.

172
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,791
Uh... Well we're a lot alike.

173
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:38,875
So I decided to name
him after myself.

174
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,541
You're pretty
weird all right.

175

Your another one.
Just like me.

179
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,458
Move it, kid.

180
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:21,666
Ya find somethin'?

181
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:36,041
[QUENT]
A boy?

182
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:37,250
No.

183
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:38,958
You're not a boy...

184
00:13:58,083 --> 00:13:59,166
Jump!

185
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,250
Hurry up!

186
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,625
Uh, I was getting ready to!

187
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:16,833
That was them.
I finally found 'em.

188
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:24,083
Who the heck was that?
And what's up with his dog?

189
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:25,583
I've no idea.

190
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:27,166
Hey, you're Tsume, right?

191
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,750
This is a first for me.
I've never met a wolf.

192
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:32,083
I mean, other than myself.

193
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:34,375
I heard rumors about you
from the crows though.

194
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,416
Uh, they said you make
friends with humans

195
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,791
and run wild with them.

196

[TOBOE chuckles]

197
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:41,250
Ya heard wrong.
I don't have friends.

198
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:45,250
I'm Toboe. Thanks for
the help back there.

199

Y'know what? I've been living
with human's my whole life--

[TSUME]
Just get lost, will ya?

201
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,166
I'm getting pissed off.

00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,416
And that only happens
when I'm around idiots.

No. You can't.

What in the world
are you doin' in here?

00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:27,250
C'mon, we're friends
now, aren't we?

209
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,708

I didn't mean to
kill him, I swear.

I knew it was yours
and I just wanted to...

[TOBOE]
Granny, she...

00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:39,000
I was all alone at the
entrance to the dome...

227

...and she was so nice to me.

She said I was so little
my eyes had barely opened.

00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:50,083
She gave these to me, and
we lived together ever since.

than an obedient dog.

It's been a long time, Cheza.

my presence, can't you?

Though your eyes do not see me.

set out on our journey.

when he's gotta take a journey.

Just like there are times
