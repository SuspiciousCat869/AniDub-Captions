like they were one of our own.

Soon after we met him,

we started getting attacked
by soldiers without warning.

No matter where we hid,

they'd find us.

How beautiful you are.

166
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,791
Come. Open your eyes.

167
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:36,833
Open them for my Paradise.

168
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:39,250
[CHEZA]
Kiba...

169
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:54,125
My prayers have been
answered. Cheza.

170
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:57,750
We must feast in celebration,
don't you think?

171
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:03,291
[JAGUARA laughing]

172
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,916
Have you seen Blue anywhere?

173
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:18,000
Why would I ask when I can't
understand the answer?

174
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,958
I've seen 'em, you know.

175
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:56,666
The wolves.
They're in this city.

176
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,458
You've had too much
to drink, old man.

177
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:03,083
"I shall tell you now
the words of Red Moon."

178
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:04,291
[SOLDIER B]
Huh?

179
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,875
"Only then will appear
the wretched beast"!

180
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,958
The wolves are everywhere!

181
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:11,125
They're here,
can't you see them?

182
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:13,416
What the hell is wrong
with you people?

183
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,333
Have they got you all
under their spell?

184
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:18,916
Open your eyes,
you spineless coward!

185
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,791
There are wolves all around you!

186
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,083
All over the city!

187
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:23,500
All over the world!

188
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,708
Open your ey--

189
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:38,083
Dumb old fart. Think we
should throw him into jail?

190
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:41,625
This isn't the time to bother
with a nuisance like him.

191
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:44,541
Not when Paradise
is about to open.

192
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:53,500
[QUENT] Did he say Paradise...
is... opening?

193
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,333
[CHER]
Darcia...

194
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:53,666
[CHER]
Wait!

195
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:06,541
[DARCIA] Will you follow me
into the very heart of darkness?

196
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:05,041
The preparations
are now complete.

197
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:08,750
Tell me, am I not beautiful?

198
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,791
Of course, you are, my lady.

199
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:15,083
For the final rite, we will
stoke the Moonlight Crucible

200
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:17,333
with the white wolf's blood.

201
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:40,500
Can you tell me what's
about to happen?

202
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:50,250
[CHEZA]
Kiba... Kiba... Are you alive?

203
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:57,625
[KIBA]
Cheza...

204
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:04,666
[KIBA]
Cheza... Sing for me.

205
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:13,875
[CHEZA singing]

206
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:26,750
It's Cheza.

207
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:28,750
I can hear Cheza's song.

208
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:31,500
Her song?

209
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,458
But why is she crying like that?

210
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:37,625
I don't know. It's so sad.

211
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:39,958
Are you hearing Cheza's voice?

212
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:56,375
You'd both be willing
to die for her.

213
00:17:56,458 --> 00:18:00,583
Why would wolves
sacrifice so much?

214
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:13,375
[singing]

215
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,750
Welcome to the great feast!

216
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:49,416
Tonight, Jaguara's Paradise
will be loosed upon the world!

217
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:54,458
[cheering]

218
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:03,208
[HIGE] I'm sorry
I made you run so much.

219
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:04,791
[BLUE]
It's okay.

220
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:07,708
[HIGE]
Blue. I have to go.

221
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:10,666
[BLUE] You're gonna
save them, aren't you?

222
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:14,625
Yeah. I have to at least try.

223
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:16,000
I guess,

224
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,750
I always thought it was luck
that brought me to them.

225
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:20,333
What a joke.

226
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:22,791
I was nothin' but trouble for
those guys from the beginning.

227
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:24,291
[BLUE]
That's not true.

228
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:25,583
Yes it is.

229
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:28,166
But I honestly didn't
remember anything.

230
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,125
I just thought we could all
make it to Paradise.

231
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:35,500
The whole way here, that's all
that was goin' through my mind.

232
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,958
And then we ended
up in this place.

233
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,500
That's why I have to go.

234
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:51,500
Then I'll go with you.

235
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:55,125
I knew you would say that.
But I can't let you.

236
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:56,541
Why not?

237
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:58,041
[HIGE]
I need you to wait here.

238
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:00,541
No, Hige! Don't leave me behind!

239
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:03,208
I won't! Please, Blue.

240
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:04,458
If I know you're waiting for me,

241
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:07,833
I'll make it back
no matter what!

242
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:10,583
It's the only thing that
can get me through this.

243
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:13,583
If I know you're here,
I won't give up.

244
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:16,291
I'll do whatever it takes
to come back to you.

245
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:19,583
I promise. I'll never
leave you alone, Blue.

246
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:51,625
[KIBA]
Cheza!

247
00:23:17,708 --> 00:23:20,041
[HUBB]
What is Paradise like, I wonder?

248
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:22,208
I'm sure each of us has
his own version of it.

249
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:25,291
For me, Paradise would be
where my beloved wife and I

250
00:23:25,375 --> 00:23:29,125
could treasure our time
alone together... Ha...

251
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:31,458
Come on, what are you
making me read here?
