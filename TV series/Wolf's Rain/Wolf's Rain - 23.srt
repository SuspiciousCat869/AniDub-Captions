00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:38,708
Look at that energy field!

2
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:42,083
Why is there so much of it
concentrated in this one place?

3
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:44,250
Gives me the creeps.

4
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:47,291
A remote stronghold
left from a Golden Age...

5
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:50,666
The Nobles call it...
the Lost City.

6
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,416
...and Jaguara controls it.

7
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:56,666
Her keep is somewhere
inside there, huh?

8
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:03,125
[CHER] What do you intend
to do with Cheza?

[GUARD] Don't stop,
keep the line moving.

12
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:06,500
That's it.

[beeping noise]

Sorry, Sir. Come with me.

15
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,833
Hey... what seems
to be the problem here?

16
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:57,125
[QUENT]
So... it was this...

17
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:20,250
[TOBOE]
Wow! It's so warm!

18
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:23,583
[HIGE] See? Boy, when
I'm right, I am so right!

19
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:24,458
Right?

20
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:26,333
You forgot to mention...

21
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:27,416
It stinks here.

22
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,166
Stop complaining.

23
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,000
How'd you know about this?

24
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:34,041
Hmm... Can't say for sure...

25
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:36,875
Hey, must be my keen instinct.

26
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:38,250
Instinct, huh?

27
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,791
[TOBOE]
Look how high the ceiling is!

28
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:45,708
Man, I've never seen
a dome this big before.

29
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:47,333
[TSUME]
So what's the plan?

30
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:49,708
Cheza's gotta be
somewhere in the keep.

31
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,625
Hmm... Well...

32
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,166
If that's the case,
it should be over there.

33
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,500
How d'you know that?

00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:58,833
[stomach growling]

[HIGE]
Uh...

36
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:02,500
Hey, why don't we
break up into teams?

37
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:04,541
You guys look for
a way in or somethin'

38
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:07,583
and the runt and I will
scope out the joint, 'kay?

00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,458
Don't you mean
scope out the food?

40
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,583
[HIGE laughs]
Don't worry.

41
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:13,875
We'll be sure to bring back
enough for everyone.

42
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:14,625
Right?

43
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:16,583
Mm-hmm!
Leave it to us!

44
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:19,875
We would be less
conspicuous if we split up.

45
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,458
All right.

46
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:23,250
The two of us'll go and check
out the area around the keep.

47
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:24,375
It's a plan.

back here at moonrise.

[BLUE] I gotta bad feeling
about this place...

51
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,833
Doesn't it feel like
we're being watched?

52
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:46,791
[CHER]
Maybe the keep is up there.

53
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:50,000
It looks like you can't get
into the city without an ID.

54
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,708
[BLUE] Well, then I guess
we'd better get some.

55
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:54,458
Easier said than done.

56
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:56,125
What do you suggest?

57
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:57,166

Sure! What do you wanna know?

Do you boys... have any IDs?

Well can't ya tell
by lookin' at us? Hmm?

know what hit 'em.

[BOTH laughing]

103
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,041
[TOBOE] We should be able
to find food and water

104
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:08,708
and just about anything else
in a place like this,

105

don'tcha think?

106
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:12,208
After you turn
the corner up ahead,

107
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,625
there's a big stairway
that leads up.

108

After that...

109
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:17,541
What are you talking about?

110

people like Tsume, too.

117
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:55,708
So what now?

118
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:59,583
Trying to go through the
front gate would be suicide.

119
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,500
Not that that scares me.

120
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:04,583
Just seems kind
of pointless, is all.

121
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:06,041
Why mince words?

122
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:08,083
You wanna find the back door?

123
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:09,666
Well, if you insist...

124
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,125
I suppose we could.

[CHAMBERLAIN]
Pardon, Milady...

126
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:28,708
IIt's come to my
attention that #23's signal

127
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:31,500
has been detected somewhere
within the city walls.

128
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:36,625
What does Milady desire us do?

129
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,958
23?

130
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:43,291
[CHAMBERLAIN]
Yes, Milady.

131
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:46,083
This would mean
they all returned.

132
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:48,791
The long awaited
time has finally arrived.

133

[JAGUARA]
Leave me.

134
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:54,458

Yes, Milady.

light of the moon...

138
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:15,583
What will he
be like, I wonder...?

lead me to Paradise...

Come on, wait up! Hige!

141
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:28,041
And just up ahead
there's a little elevator...

142
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,583
And past that...

143
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,708
[TOBOE]
I don't believe it...

144
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:43,375
This oughta take us
all the way up.

145
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:44,416
Hey...

146
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,166
Shouldn't we be
heading back by now?

147
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,833
Relax. We'll be fine.

148
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:50,125
Let's just see how far
we can go' kay?

149
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:03,208
[TOBOE]
Wow, Hige... how did you know?

150
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:04,791
You've been here before, right?

151
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,125
[HIGE]
Nope.

152
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,208
But when your instincts
are as sharp as mine are,

153
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:09,666
you get a feel for things.

154
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:32,250
I don't like this place...

155
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:49,791
[QUENT]
Humph.

156
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,750
What can I getcha?

157
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:59,458
[QUENT] Vodka. And fill
this up for me, will ya?

158
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:01,208
[SOLDIER B]
So we finally mopped up

159
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:03,750
what was left of
Orkham's troops, huh?

160
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:05,333
[SOLDIER C]
What a miserable way to go.

161
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:08,916
Well, that means the world
belongs to Lady Jaguara now.

what's with the snazzy dresser
that was brought in?

164
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,583
[SOLDIER A]
Oh...

165
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,083
you mean that dandy we captured
with the Flower Maiden?

166
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:18,000
Yeah, Mr. Fancy
Pants keeps claimin'

167
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,625
he's some kind of detective.

168
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:22,458
I always knew detectives
belonged in the dungeon.

169
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,333
[SOLDIERS laughing]

170
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,583
[BARTENDER]
Excuse me, Sir...

171
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:30,125
...but something tells me
you're new to this city.

172
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,083
So where are you from?

173
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:33,958
From the ends of the earth.

174
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:36,291
I came here lookin' for wolves.

175
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:37,625
[SOLDIERS laughing]

176
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:39,875
The old guy says
he's a wolf hunter!

177
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,375
[SOLDIER C] Too bad for him
there're no bounties

178
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:42,875
to be had around here.

179
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:44,166
At least not anymore.

180
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,083
[SOLDIERS laughing]

181
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,958
I ain't here for that.

182
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:50,583
Besides, what difference
would a bounty make?

183
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:52,666
Sorry about that, old man.

184
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,583
We didn't mean to laugh
at you, it's just that...

185
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:57,583
It looks like you
got here a little late.

186
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:01,500
There aren't any wolves.

187
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:04,041
My men and I have already
killed almost all of them.

188
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:08,041
We just got a
"mission complete" notification.

189
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:11,291
It was handed down
from Lady Jaguara herself.

190
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:14,083
Maybe you don't realize
who you've been talking to.

191
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:16,291
We're Special Ops: Anti-wolf.

192
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:19,708
[SOLDIER A] Feel free
to look for 'em if you want,

193
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:22,375
but trust me, pal,
you're not gonna find any.

194
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:23,958
[SOLDIERS laughing]

195
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:26,041
Those things aren't
that easy to kill.

196
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:31,458
There are still
wolves around here.

197
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:33,166
I know it for a fact.

198
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:37,166
[SOLDIERS laughing]

199
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:43,000
Hey...

200
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:45,333
How come there isn't
any scent in this place?

201
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:46,500
[HIGE]
Who knows.

202
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:48,125
Maybe that Jaguara
lady's a clean freak.

203
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,250
[TOBOE]
Wait up, would ya?

204
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:58,625
[TOBOE]
What's the matter?

205
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,666
[HIGE]
Every time I try to think,

206
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,666
my head starts pounding.

207
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,666
Probably not used
to the strain, is all.

208
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:10,708
Hige, please.
Tell me what's wrong.

209
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:12,208
Nothin's wrong, okay?

210
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:14,541
[TOBOE] C'mon, you've been
acting weird since we got here.

211
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,375
Get off my back, will ya?!

212
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:17,416
Hige!

213
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:43,250
[HIGE yells]

214
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:44,375
Hige?

215
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:45,500
[yelling continues]

216
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:46,541
Hige!

217
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:52,750
Hige!

218
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,041
[TOBOE]
Hige!

[door opens]

220
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:00,083
[SHOPKEEP]
Thief!

221
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,166
[BOY 1]
Ha ha!

222
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:03,958
Remind you of anyone?

223
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:06,625
Even this city has
people like the old you.

224
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:09,250
Yeah. Looks that way.

225
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,250
But it's guys like that

226
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,791
who know the back alleys
better than anyone.

227
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,791
What the hell
do you want?!

228
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,000
[TSUME]
I wanna talk.

229
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:21,000
[BOY 1]
Wha--?

230
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:22,583
Keep walkin', pal.

231
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,500
I'm not in the mood
for handouts.

232
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:25,875
Go get your own food!

233
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,166
I just wanna ask
you a question.

234
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,291
Look...

235
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,333
I'm tired and hungry
so leave me alone.

236
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:35,541
What's the deal?

237
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:40,583
Hey, if you guys wanna fight,
it's fine by me.

238
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:43,666
[crash]

239

[gun clicks]

240
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:06,000
Uh... You're the man!

241
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,041
[BOY 1]
Huh?

242
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,125
[BOY 1]
All right, I give.

243
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,291
You guys are too tough
to argue with.

244
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,291
So, where are you from, anyway?

245
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,250
[TSUME]
Oh, here and there.

246
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:18,708
I know the feeling.

247
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,291
Me and "Verbal" here
have been wanderin'

248
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:23,500
from dome to dome ever
since the fat hit the fire.

249
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,333
They said this one was
the best of the lot

250
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:27,166
so we decided to check it out.

251
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,250
I can't say that
I agree with them.

252
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:30,375
Can you?

253
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:36,375
[BOY 1] So... You got
a question? Fire away.

254
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:38,375
[TSUME] We're trying
to get into the keep.

255
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:40,708
Is there a way to do it
without getting spotted?

256
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:41,583
[BOY 1]
Huh?

257
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,041
Are you guys nuts?

258
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:46,375
You don't mean Lady
Jaguara's keep, do ya?

259
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:48,250
[TSUME]
Uh huh.

260
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:49,833
Oh, forget it!

261
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:51,166
I know you're strong and all,

262
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:54,375
but not even the two of you
could get in there.

263
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:55,875
Why the hell would
you even wanna do it

264
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:57,250
in the first place?

265
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,000
They stole a woman from us.

266
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:04,208
And you wanna steal her
back from that Noble?!

267
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:06,291
You must really
think I'm a sucker.

268
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:07,375
We're serious.

269
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,500
But that's suicide!

270
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:13,041
You can't mess around
with a Noble!

271
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:15,083
Especially Lady Jaguara.

272
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:17,166
Word on the street is
she's some kinda witch

273
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,208
who casts all these
whacked out spells.

274
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:22,166
[KIBA] We don't care
who or what she is.

275
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,666
We came all this way
to save Cheza...

276
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,625
and there's nothing
they can do to stop us.

277
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:29,458
Oh man.

278
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:31,333
You're guys are askin' for
a whole mess of trouble,

279
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:32,875
ya know that?

280
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:35,791
But hey, if that's what ya want,
it's not like I give a crap.

281
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:38,041
We can show you the way in,
but that's all.

282
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,458
That'll be enough.

283
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:42,833
Once we're in, I'm sure we
can handle the rest of it.

284
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:45,000
Damn, you're cool.

285
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:46,500
He's the man.

286
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,666
What is this?

287
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,291
Some kind of shakedown?

288
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:53,708
You bitches tricked me!

289
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:55,250
[CHER] Do you want
to get slapped again?

290
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:56,875
All right, enough already!

291
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:59,041
Fine! You can have them!

292
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:00,916
Here. Now get lost.

293
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,708
If you'd done this
in the first place,

294
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,708
you never would have
gotten yourself hurt.

295
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:13,375
Beautiful flowers
always have thorns.

296
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:15,291
You would do well
to remember that.

297
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:29,791
[BOY 1]
This is it.

298
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,958
No one's ever followed it all
the way to the end before,

299
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:33,166
but the cables around here

300
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,416
definitely run
underneath the keep.

301
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,125
With any luck,
they should get you in.

302
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:38,416
[TSUME]
Right.

303
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,916
[BOY 1] Some guy told me
that these things

304
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,708
are supposed to carry energy
into the city or somethin'.

305
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:45,500
Do you feel that?

306
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:46,958
Yeah.

307
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:49,833
It's the complete opposite
of basking in the moonlight.

308
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:53,125
It feels like my strength's
being sucked out.

309
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:56,416
And somethin' tells me it's only
gonna get worse up ahead.

310
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,750
I know.

311
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:58,916
Listen...

312
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,958
Are you really goin' in there?

313
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:02,000
Yeah.

314
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:03,666
Thanks for the help, guys.

315
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:13,541
You know, Tsume...

316
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:15,291
The others might
be waiting for us.

317
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:20,458
[TSUME]
Do you wanna turn back?

318
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,666
[TSUME]
Then let's keep going.

319
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,916
Knowing Hige, I'm sure
he'll catch up with us

320
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,958
sooner or later.

321
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:30,833
We just need to
have a little faith.

322
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,583
Good luck, wolves.

323
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:42,458
You can do it.

324
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:43,500
[BOY 1]
Huh?

325
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:22,500
Damn it!

326
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:24,500
What the hell's
wrong with me?

327
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:25,708
Why am I...?

328
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,916
[HIGE yelling]

329
00:20:58,708 --> 00:20:59,750
[HIGE yells]

330
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:12,625
[SOLDIER D]
#23, huh?

331
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:14,416
[SOLDIER E] Doesn't look like
any others are with him.

332
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:42,125
Why did they spare me?

333
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:43,583
I don't get it...

334
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:47,708
[HIGE groaning]

335
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,083
My head...
What's going on?

336
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:20,291
[HIGE]
Damn, my head hurts!

337
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:22,208
At times like this,
a little temple rub

338
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:25,458
from a cute girl would
fix me up in a flash.

339
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:26,375
Oh well...

340
00:23:26,458 --> 00:23:28,333
There's no sense in dreaming.

341
00:23:28,416 --> 00:23:30,791
Guess I'll have to try
some pickled plums.
