You could say that.

00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:13,625
we were split up.

I know he was.

00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:19,708
That's why he was there.

Isn't she with you?

Y'know, the one you guys
were traveling with?

140
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:32,250
She had a...

141
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,208
a really strange scent.

You mean Cheza?

Cheza...?

145
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,416
[HIGE]
Oh, uh...

146
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,958
about that, well...

147
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:44,125
Let's just say we shouldn't talk
about that right now, okay?

148
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,916
I know! Why don't we
look for some food?!

149
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,666
I mean, we did just bump
into each other and all.

150
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,458
Besides, there's a
whole mess of danger

151
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,625
for a girl on her own
in a town like this.

[TSUME]
Not a chance, porky.

Why not?!

154
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,166
[TSUME]
As if I'd ever hang with her.

155
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,208
She was doing everything
she could to hunt us down.

156

[HIGE]
Yeah, but...

157
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:05,333
You know you're only saying that
because it didn't happen to you.

[BLUE laughs]

159
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,833
Forget it.

160
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:11,208
I don't want to hang out with
a bunch of kids, either.

00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:17,666
Wait up!

166
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,083
[TOBOE]
But, Hige!!

167
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:24,041
His tail wags whenever
there's a girl around.

168
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,625
Just let him go.

169
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,833
When we were back in that city,
she found out she was half wolf.

170
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:30,291
Cheza told her.

171
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:31,458
[TOBOE]
Half wolf?

172
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,666
[KIBA] That side of
her must've woken up

173
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,916
after meeting Cheza.

174
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:37,708
[TOBOE]
Cheza.

175
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:39,458
I wonder what she's doing.

176
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:41,791
You think she's okay?

177
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,291
[HIGE]
Wait up, will ya?

178
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:48,375
You should go back.

179
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:50,125
Your friends are
gonna leave you behind.

180
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:51,291
That's okay.

181
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:53,750
Life's pretty borin'
when it's only guys.

182
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:04,958
[HUBB sighs]

183
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:07,750
I can't believe it held
together this long.

184
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:15,291
[BARTENDER] So... You say
you're from Freeze City.

185
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:16,333
Is that right?

186
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:17,875
[HUBB]
That's right.

187
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:19,166
[BARTENDER] Well, if you've
come all this way to find her,

188
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,666
she must've done somethin'
pretty awful, huh?

189
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:25,500
Yeah, She's a master criminal
with the face of an angel.

190
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:26,666
Hey, wait.

191
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,833
That's the woman.

192
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:29,458
You know, the one
who drank like a fish.

193
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:31,125
You mean, you saw her?

194
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:33,333
Yeah. She came in
here a while ago.

195
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:36,458
She was throwin' 'em back
with that old guy over there.

196
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,125
[BARTENDER B]
Mister!

197
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:41,500
Hey, mister!

198
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:42,833
[QUENT]
Hm?

199
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:44,208
[gasps]

200
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,208
You again.

201
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:54,041
[QUENT] I can't believe she was
the woman you were lookin' for.

202
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:55,041
[HUBB]
How'd she look?

203
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,625
Was she okay?

204
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,625
[QUENT] Well, considering the
amount of booze she was drinkin,

205
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,583
she seemed fine to me.

206
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,041
Oh, is that so?

207
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,875
You'd be better off
to just give up

208
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:06,166
on a headstrong
woman like that.

209
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:09,500
She only seems that way, but
I know how she really is.

210
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:12,166
I've been at her side for as
long as I can remember.

211
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,708
Believe me, it's a big mistake

212
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:15,208
to think that you know
everything about

213
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:18,541
someone just because you're
with them all the time.

214
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:21,583
So I take it your search for
the wolves is going well.

215
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:24,708
And where's your dog?
Was she too headstrong for you?

216
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:28,000
I guess she was.
She ran off on me.

217
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,083
I'm so tired I can
barely think.

218
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:33,500
It's gotten so bad,

219
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:35,875
I don't even know what the hell
I've been searchin' for.

220
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:38,208
Wolves, remember?

221
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:39,791
Yeah.

222
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:41,583
It was the wolves.

223
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:44,666
It's always been wolves.

224
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,333
I'd love to stay and chat, but
I really don't have the time.

225
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:48,625
Excuse me.

226
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:50,750
[QUENT] I've always
had this suspicion...

227
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:53,375
Ever since my boy found
Blue and brought her home,

228
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:55,500
even though she
was just a pup.

229
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:58,458
I figured she had some
wolf blood in her.

230
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:00,583
That's the reason she
was able to track down

231
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:02,625
the wolves so well.

232
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:11,375
I've never been
good with drunks.

233
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,791
[TOBOE]
I wonder where Hige ran off to.

234
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:18,583
[TSUME] Once he gets dumped
he'll come sulking back.

235
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:20,666
[TOBOE exhales]

236
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,291
I'm gonna go look
around for him.

237
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:24,875
Just take it easy
till I get back.

238
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:31,708
[KIBA] That's the same
crest from the castle

239
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,375
where Cheza was held.

240
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:34,875
[TSUME sighs]
This area

241
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:37,583
must still be part of
that Noble's territory.

242
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:40,125
[KIBA] The curse of the
House of Darcia, huh?

243
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:41,458
What?

244
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:44,000
That's what the guy back
there said when he saw us.

245
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:45,166
[TSUME]
Mm.

246
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,291
Humans have always
seen wolves that way.

247
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:50,166
That's why they're
so scared of us.

248
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:53,166
Why didn't you let 'em
have it back there?

249
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,000
I would've expected you to jump

250
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:57,791
at the chance to rip
those humans to pieces.

251
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:59,750
It's not 'cause of
your injuries, is it.

252
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,000
Even if we had killed 'em,

253
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:03,666
I doubt they would have
tasted very good.

254
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:07,875
Can't argue with that.

255
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:10,791
[HIGE] So, how come those guys
were chasin' you, anyway?

256
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:13,041
[BLUE] I thought that
I should work, y'know?

257
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:16,458
[HIGE] Work? I've never
given it much thought.

258
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:18,583
That's how it's
supposed to be, huh?

259
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:22,000
But it's hard to let go of, when
that's all you've ever known.

260
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:25,500
For my entire life,
I've been at Pop's side,

261
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:28,333
always wanting to be
useful to him somehow,

262
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:30,000
if I could.

263
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,666
I'll bet from your
point of view,

264
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:35,625
choosing to live that way must
sound like complete nonsense.

265
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,833
But the thing is,

266
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:39,916
I was always happy
being that way.

267
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,250
[BLUE]
If nothing had happened,

268
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:56,041
I could've stayed
happy forever.

269
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,250
[QUENT]
There were wolves.

270
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:25,125
It was if they were mocking me.

271
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:29,750
They took away everything in
my life that was precious to me.

272
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:36,375
[BLUE]
I don't know what happened,

273
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:39,708
or if it really was wolves
who killed everyone.

274
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:41,166
But even so...

275
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,166
that's what the Pops believes.

276
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,416
[HIGE]
Man.

277
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,000
And just because of that
he hates all wolves?

278
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:50,708
[BLUE] If I had stayed
ignorant of what I was,

279
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:54,583
I would've been able to
remain at Pop's side forever.

280
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:57,083
If I had never met that girl...

281
00:15:57,166 --> 00:16:00,875
I could have kept on living
the way I always had been.

282
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:04,083
If I hadn't learned that
there was some wolf in me...

283
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:05,625
[HIGE]
So what are you gonna do now?

284
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:07,500
You want to go back
to that guy?

285
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,166
[BLUE]
I can't go back.

286
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:12,916
If I did, I'd have to
hunt you guys down again.

287
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,166
[HIGE]
Heh. Sounds nice.

288
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,833
I wouldn't mind being
hunted down by a girl.

289
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:20,916
I'm usually the one
who does all the chasing.

290
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,708
But, somehow, they always
manage to get away.

291
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:26,875
Whenever I get in the mood,
I always have to take a leak.

292
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:28,500
Kinda like right now.

293
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:31,083
Well go somewhere and
do it, that's disgusting.

294
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:32,125
I'll hold it.

295
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:34,416
It looks like you're
ready to run.

296
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:38,375
[BLUE laughs]
You're nice...

297
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:40,458
Gross, but nice.

298
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:44,250
[HIGE]
Yeah. I get that all the time.

299
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,541
[BLUE] Hey, why don't
you come with me?

300
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:48,041
[HIGE]
Where to?

301
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:52,166
Doesn't matter where, does it?

302
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,041
Sounds tempting...

303
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:56,041
Huh?

304
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:57,916
What the hell're
you doin' here?!

305
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,791
I just happened to
be passing by...

[HIGE]
Damn!

311
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:11,625
Hey! What're you doin'?

312
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:13,250
We gotta go!

[THUG C laughs]

314
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,541
Well, lookyhere.
We found us some wolves.

315
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:28,875
Ha. Jaguara's people will pay
us a small fortune for you.

316
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:30,333
Jaguara?

317
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:37,125
They're gone...

Are you okay?

00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:54,916
Don't worry, the bullet
only grazed my arm.

[ELMIRA]
What's the matter?

325
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:58,916
Have you boys been hurt?

326
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,166

Elmira...

329
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,916
You come over here, now.

330
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,708
[KIBA] We have no intention of
hurting either one of you.

331
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:10,916
[ELMIRA] Oh, for heaven's
sake, dear, put the gun down.

332
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,125
They're only children.

[OLD MAN]
Don't be stupid,

334
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,375
they're strays and
they're dangerous!

335
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:18,500
What are you talking about,
have you lost your senses?!

336
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:22,416
Elmira, I may be an old man,
but I am not going senile!

337
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,958
Take a close look at those two!

338
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:26,958

We are not gonna
do anything to you.

341
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:42,416
So just leave us alone.

342
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:47,208
I don't wanna fight
if there's no reason to.

343
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:49,291
I don't wanna kill.

[THUG B]
Did ya see the wolves?!

[THUG C]
Search over there!

346
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:54,375
[TSUME]
Those people want to capture us

347
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:55,708
and sell us to
the highest bidder.

348
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:58,250
It's up to you whether
we can avoid bloodshed.

[OLD MAN]
Die, you damn wolves!

350
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:10,166
Take this!

351
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,875
And this!

352
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:12,958
Did you kill them?!

Stop it! That's enough!

355
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,208
They cast a spell on me!

00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:18,208
I was only--

357
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:20,500
[ELMIRA]
Calm down, it's safe now!

358
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:21,666
Dammit.

359
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,666
Those things are worthless
if they're dead!

360
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,083
[HUBB] Nobody should
ever get married...

361
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,583
Got that right!

362
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,416
A man's better off without
a wife weighin' 'im down.

363
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,541
What the hell is wrong
with being single?!

364
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:35,083
You can live your
life just fine!

365
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,458
Wives do nothin' but
drive a man crazy.

366
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:39,500
There's just no
figurin' 'em out.

367
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:42,333
You think you know 'er, but the
minute the "I do's" are done,

368
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:44,041
she becomes a different person.

369
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:46,083
You are so right.

370
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:49,875
And it's only after the
divorce she loosens up...

371
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:52,666
No sane man should ever
have a family...

372
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,583
[HUBB]
Damn straight.

373
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:57,000
You're better off not
having anything...

374
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:59,416
that's precious to you.

375
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,541
[HUBB]
Oh, Cher,

376
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:04,541
where are you?

377
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,708
[QUENT]
Hey, Detective Dandy.

378
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:24,708
[HUBB]
Huh?

379
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:26,041
[QUENT]
Wanna go up the road?

380
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,541
Check out the next town?

381
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:28,625
[HUBB]
The what?

382
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:30,291
[QUENT]
If she was still in the area,

383
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,250
you should've bumped
into her by now.

384
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:34,500
And since you haven't,
my guess is she's

385
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:38,833
either gone back home, or she's
moved on to the next city.

386
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:43,166
Cher would never go back.
Not with the way things are.

387
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,041
[QUENT]
Well, then...

388
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:45,833
that settles it.

389
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:48,666
[ELMIRA]
Please forgive my husband.

390
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:53,083
I can't believe he thought you
were wolves, of all things.

391
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:56,916
He's starting to get more
and more confused lately.

392
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,166
That's why we came out here
on this little jaunt.

393
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:03,416
"Let's spend the time we have
left on the road", he said.

394
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,750
So now,

395
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:09,375
this trailer is our home,
as well as our coffin.

396
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:11,791
But we've seen such
horrible things.

397
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:14,458
That castle of the Darcias
to the west of here,

398
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:16,416
which must have been
beautiful once,

399
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,375
is nothing but a giant grave.

400
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:20,041
The castle of the Darcias...?

401
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:22,166
It's as if everything
in this world

402
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:25,041
has given up its desire to live.

403
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:27,125
[KIBA]
No, it hasn't.

404
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:30,875
The old man isn't
confused at all.

405
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,416
He's right.

406
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,666
We are wolves.

407
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,750
Y'ready to go?

408
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,125
[TOBOE]
Mm.

409
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:38,291
G'bye, mister. Take care.

410
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,791
Where are you going to go?

411
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:45,125
To the castle in the west.

412
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:19,833
[QUENT] There are times in your
life when you shouldn't drink.

413
00:23:19,916 --> 00:23:21,833
At work and behind the wheel.

414
00:23:21,916 --> 00:23:25,541
Don't drink when you drive and
don't drive when you drink.

415
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:28,666
If you ask me,
I say why buy the car

416
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:31,125
when you can spend the
money on more booze?
