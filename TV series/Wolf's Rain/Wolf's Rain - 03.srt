[DARCIA] We'll meet in Paradise.
If we meet again, that is.

[QUENT]
Look at this.

13
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:53,833
Pretty, ain't it? A souvenir
from an angry wolf.

14
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:55,791
You can't prove it was a wolf.

15
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:58,916
[QUENT] Well, there weren't
any cats or ferrets around.

16
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,750
There was only a young human.

17
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:05,750
That beast turned into a little
boy right in front of my eyes.

18
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,958
He was just a kid.

19

Hey! Snap out of it, would ya?

Is it...? It's gone.

22
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:20,041
You felt that, didn't you?
You heard it, right?

23
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:23,791
Such a sad voice...

24
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:25,833
[TSUME]
It was a machine. That's all.

25
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,333
Probably the dying sounds of
some old robot breaking down.

26
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:37,166
Can you remember at all what
this boy's face looked like?

27
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,416
I'm trying to,

28
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,208
but for some reason my
memory's a little fuzzy.

29
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,333
Maybe I should come
back another time.

30
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:50,958
It'll always be the same.
But I'm not drunk yet tonight.

31
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:54,583
I don't know why I ever thought
I could come to you for advice.

32
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:57,708
You're obsessed with
the wolves, huh?

33
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:58,708
[QUENT chuckles]

34
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:00,583
Yer dyin' to know
everything now.

35
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:02,541
Isn't that right, Detective.

36
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,458
The dog you shot ran away.

37
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,333
What a surprise.

38
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:09,583
And you think it put some
kinda spell on us to escape?

39
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,583
You got it.

40
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,958
Hah. That just isn't possible.

41
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:17,583
[QUENT] These claw marks,
and the fact that you're here

42
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,791
should be proof
enough for anyone.

43
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,000
There're a lot more
of 'em, y' know.

44
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:27,208
People you pass everyday on
the street or in the market.

45
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:29,833
The poor slob sittin'
next to you in a bar.

46
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:32,083
Any one of 'em could be a wolf.

47
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,541
[QUENT] "I tell you now
the words of Red Moon.

48
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:43,833
From the Great Spirit
was born the wolf

49
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:46,875
and man became its messenger."

50
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:50,208
In other words, the human
race was created from wolves.

51
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:53,625
So says the author of
the <i>Book of the Moon.</i>

<i>Book of the Moon?</i>

53
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:57,541
I guess I might as well say it.

54
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,208
Instead of lookin' for wolves,

55
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:01,666
you oughta start
suspecting humans.

Where the hell are we going?

00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:25,000
Just a hunch.

62
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:32,666
[HIGE] Looks like that guy
stole the only clue we had.

63
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:36,416
And the scent of Lunar
Flowers is gone now, too.

64
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,666

Hige, he knew about Paradise.

65

That's why he took her.

Well, we'll just have
to find another Flower.

She can't be the only
one around, right?

That man knew us.

69
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:49,208
He saw what we were the
minute he looked at us.

Why don't we blow this town?
C'mon, let's look for Paradise.

surprised, that's all.

made you feel sad.

be honest with yourself.

Fine, whatever. If you
wanna go, then go.

So, why did you save me then?

101

If you really don't care,
then you should've just left me

102

to recognize me.

I mean, I'm not your
friend or anything.

pretty weird.

00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:20,125
You sold me out?

159
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:23,500
They caught us when we tried
to sneak on the train.

160
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:27,083
We couldn't just let you
get away scot-free.

161
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:28,166
[TSUME]
Heh.

162
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,083
You damn humans.

00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:31,125
[gasps]

164
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:47,666
Dad? Is it okay if I go
look for it a little?

165
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,166
[LEARA'S DAD]
Let it go, Leara.

166
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,083
But it's true, Dad, I swear!
I really did see one of 'em.

167
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:53,583
Enough already!

168
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:56,916
Keep talking like that and
people will think you're crazy.

169
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,208
You already do, don't ya, Dad?

170
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:01,166
Wait. Leara!

171
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,041
Sorry.

172
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,250
Leara!

00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,000
[TOBOE] What does he know?
I'm fine by myself.

175
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,041
[clatter]

176
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:24,833
Uh-oh. Must a taken
a wrong turn.

177
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:25,625
Huh?

178
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:27,458
Hey, hey! One of our own!

179
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:29,333
[KIBA]
Move it, will ya?

180
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,541
That's the last time
I trust your nose.

181
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,000
Well, anyone's nose
would go numb

182
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:34,875
after a night in
that stink hole!

183
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:38,666
[TOBOE] Y-You guys?
No way! Y-You're...

184
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
[TOBOE]
Leara.

185
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:46,291
[TOBOE] Don't be scared.
I won't do anything.

186
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:49,000
I just... wanted
to see you again...

187
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:52,458
I'm so sorry...
about your bird.

Come quick! It's the wolf!

191
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,250
The wolf is here!

00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,291

Daddy, over here!

196
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:19,166
[TOBOE] Stay calm.
Stay calm. Stay calm.

197
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:23,708
Why, Leara? Why did you scream?

198
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:25,750
No! Stay away!

199
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:28,291
There's... There's
something wrong with you.

200
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:31,250
You're not normal! How can
anyone ever trust you?!

201
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:35,250
Leara, please. I only showed
you so you could trust me.

202
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:36,541
Don't come any closer!

203
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:38,625
Why? Didn't you come
here to catch me?!

204
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:39,708
No!

205
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:42,541
Come on!

00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,083
[LEARA'S DAD]
Leara!

207
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:48,666

[growling]

209
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:03,000
You're pretty good.

210
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:26,916
[HUBB] First dogs and now birds.
My allergies are killing me.

211
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,416
The Aviation Bureau says

212
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,250
there weren't any unauthorized
air craft in the vicinity.

213
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,041
[HUBB] Well, the Nobles
are the only ones allowed

214
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,750
to fly anymore.

215
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:37,125
You know, you really
shouldn't talk like that.

216
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:57,625
I told you, I hate
smelly places.

217

[HIGE]
Hey, runt, what's eatin' you?

218
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:05,333
I'm not a runt!
My name's Toboe.

219
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:08,416
That's cool. Well, I'm Hige
and this here's Kiba.

220
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,875
Where're we headed, anyway?

221
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:11,875
Where d'ya think?
The exit, o'course.

222
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:13,166
To the exit?

223
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,666
We're leaving town.

224
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,833
You're leaving town? But
where else're you gonna go?

225
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,583
To Paradise.

226
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:21,375
Paradise?

227
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:25,458
[TOBOE]
Hey, guys, do you know Tsume?

228
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:26,208
[KIBA]
Tsume?

229
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:27,583
Naw, never heard of him.

230
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,500
[KIBA] Is he the one with
the scar on his chest?

231
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:31,625
Yeah, that's Tsume all right!

232
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:33,416
Okay, what about him?

233
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:38,875
He's one of us so I thought
he might wanna leave, too.

234
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:40,125
[HIGE]
Well, I don't know him.

235
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:42,875
Where is he?
Hiding out some place?

236
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:46,375
[TOBOE] I don't know.
We got split up.

237
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:49,583
[HIGE] Sorry, pal, but it's too
late to go back for him now.

238
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:52,000
So, what, is he...
like a friend of yours?

239
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:55,708
No, he's not! He isn't
my friends, but...

240
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,791
So? Ditch 'im already.

241
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,625
[HIGE]
Shake a leg, runt.

242
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:02,041
[TOBOE]
That's Toboe!

243
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,125
[HUBB]
<i>Book of the Moon.</i>

244
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:14,583
No matching records.

[DETECTIVE A]
Hubb.

246
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:16,625
Hey, your dinner's here.

247
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,291
Thanks, I'm starving.

248
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:22,458
Isn't it kinda late to
be going out on a raid?

249
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:24,333
[DETECTIVE A] Ah, it's
that gang of thieves again.

250
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,875
They finally found the
last of their hideouts.

251
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:29,166
They were tracking the leader
this afternoon, a young guy,

252
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:32,958
but then, outta nowhere,
this huge black dog shows up.

253
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:33,958
Dog?

254
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:35,500
Yeah, and the weird thing is,

255
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:39,583
when they lost sight of the
guy, this other dog appeared.

256
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,500
What's wrong?

257
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:42,541
[thud]

00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:44,708
[HUBB]
You!

259
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:58,041
[HIGE] What a crap heap. Why
the hell'd you bring us here?

260
00:16:58,125 --> 00:16:58,791
Tsume?

261
00:16:58,875 --> 00:16:59,708
[TSUME]
You?

262
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:01,583
Wha--? Hey, is this him?

263
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,833
I could smell the blood
from your wound.

264
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:05,083
What?

265
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:06,958
[KIBA] I smelled it all
the way here from town.

266
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:09,375
And you're gonna nurse
me back to health?

267
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:10,958
Well, I don't need your help.

268
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:13,125
Tsume. Look, I...

269
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:16,333
We're leaving the city.

270
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:18,541
I really think you
should come with us.

271
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:21,916
And just where is this
merry band of yours going?

272
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,583
To Paradise.

273
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:25,791
Hah. Ya kiddin' me.

274
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:28,333
You're going with them because
you believe in that crap?

275
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:31,041
Oh, I don't know,
but, if we stay here,

276
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:34,666
we'll have to spend the rest of
our lives in hiding, or worse.

277
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:38,125
We just can't live with the
humans anymore and survive.

278
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:42,125
Look, I hate to interrupt,

279
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:44,875
but a nasty stink
is headed this way.

280
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:46,875
[TSUME]
We're surrounded.

281
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:51,208
Let me ask you. Why did you
guys come to this city?

282
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:54,416
It was because of the
Flower scent, wasn't it?

283
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,500
Well, it's gone now.

284
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:58,541
There's no reason to stay.

285
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:02,791
The Flower has nothing
to do with it.

286
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,833
I'm here because I belong.

287
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:08,416
[KIBA] I can see that.
This city is a dump.

288
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,583
I still have a score
to settle with you.

289
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:12,208
We don't have time for this!

290
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:15,208
The last time we met you said
something about how your pride

291
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:17,333
wouldn't allow you
to pass as a human.

292
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:20,458
Well, you look pretty human
now. Where'd your pride go?

293
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:23,666
Nowhere. Nothing has changed.

294
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,541
Do you have the slightest idea

295
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:27,958
of what leaving
the city would mean?

296
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:29,375
[KIBA]
Yeah.

297
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,416
You'll just die.

298
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,916
Possibly. Everyone's gonna die.

299
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,166
It's a natural part of life.

300
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:39,000
But if your life has no
purpose, you're dead already.

301
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:02,875
[TOBOE]
Thank you.

302
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:04,791
[TSUME]
Go on. Hurry up!

303
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,958
You're really not
coming with us?

304
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:13,583
Tsume!

305
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:19,375
[QUENT] What made you
decide to join me?

306
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:23,375
Wolves don't exist. I'm
only here to prove that.

307
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,791
What the hell're
you stopping for?

308
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:54,541
Tsume!

309
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:58,666
This way!

310
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:16,625
[HIGE]
Jump already!

311
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:18,750
I was getting
ready to, all right?!

312
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:19,291
Move it!

[HUBB]
Hey! Wait a minute!

316
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:34,708
Tsume, what are you waiting
for? Come on, jump!

317
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:37,541
Stop it! You don't have
the right to shoot!

318
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:38,750
You idiot!

319
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:42,375
He's a human, Quent!
He looks human to me!

320
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:45,375
[KIBA]
Are you scared?

321
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,875
Yeah, you wish.

322
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:15,250
I'm not trackin' 'em for
pleasure or curiosity, y'know.

323
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:16,958
It's for revenge.

324
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,541
Now do you believe?

325
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:21,000
[HUBB]
Believe what?

326
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,250
[QUENT chuckles]

327
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:24,833
That you've been
deceived this entire time...

328
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,791
...by a pack of wolves.

329
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:31,083
You're wrong...

330
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,000
It's not possible...

331
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:38,875
[TSUME]
Screw this stupid journey.

332
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:41,500
Paradise can kiss my ass.

333
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:46,041
I'm just... fed up with
this stinking town.

334
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:48,500
It was time to move on anyway.

335
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:20,333
[HUBB] Hay fever season
is almost upon us again.

336
00:23:20,416 --> 00:23:23,791
Overcoming your allergies begins
with improving your lifestyle.

337
00:23:23,875 --> 00:23:25,500
A balanced diet is important.

338
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:27,750
As is a regular
sleeping schedule

339
00:23:27,833 --> 00:23:30,416
and preventing stress
from building up.
