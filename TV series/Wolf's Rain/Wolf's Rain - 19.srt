[gasps]

2
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:26,208
Kiba.

3
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:28,166
Kiba!

4
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:40,500
[TOBOE]
He's gone.

5
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:43,541
Why can't we find him?

6
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:47,041
[HIGE] Listen, we looked
for him everywhere we could.

7
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,916
[TOBOE]
But he... he couldn't be!

8
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,791
[HIGE]
Maybe he is.

9
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:54,000
He might not have made it.

10
00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:00,125
[HIGE]
Tsume, where are you going?

11
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:01,666
[TSUME]
To look for him again.

12
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,000
[HIGE]
What's the point?

13
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,416
You won't find anything.

14
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,041
I'm telling you, even
his scent isn't there.

15
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:10,500
I give up. It's hopeless.

16
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,875
[TSUME]
Give up on what?

17
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:15,875
[HIGE] Paradise. I don't
give a damn anymore.

18
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:16,875
[TSUME]
What are you saying?

19
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:18,666
[HIGE]
I'm sayin', count me out.

20
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,916
[gasps] What?!
You can't be serious!

21
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,166
[HIGE]
I was never really interested

22
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,708
in goin' to Paradise
in the first place.

23
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:26,958
[TSUME]
Really?

24
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:29,791
And you always seemed
so happy to be with us.

25
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:33,333
If I had never met him,

26
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:37,416
none of this would ever
have happened to me.

27
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,125
[TSUME]
You're right.

28
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:40,833
If he hadn't shown
up in the city,

29
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:43,125
I doubt any of us
would have left.

30
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:45,833
We probably could have spent
our whole lives there

31
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:47,708
without too much trouble.

32
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:50,291
[HIGE] Things were a lot
easier, that's for sure.

33
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:53,833
[TSUME] Yeah. Except, we
were pathetic back there.

34
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:56,791
[HIGE] We're pretty
pathetic out here, too.

35
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:03,625
[TOBOE]
C'mon. Cut it out, would you?

36
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:05,000
Isn't it bad enough

37
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:08,000
that our bodies have
been totally wrecked?

38
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:14,541
Why does everybody have
to fight about everything?

39
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:18,500
Arguing and stealing from
each other all the time?

40
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:23,208
I mean, it's a big enough world,
why can't we share it?

41
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:24,166
Wolves,

42
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,416
and humans,

43
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,625
and birds,

44
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:27,875
and flowers,

45
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:30,833
living together, as equals.

46
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:33,208
If we all got to Paradise,

47
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:36,125
that's how it would
be, wouldn't it?

48
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:05,291
[sniffing]

49
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:08,208
[TSUME]
What is it?

50
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:10,708
[TOBOE] I'm not sure,
but it's a familiar scent.

51
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:12,333
[TSUME]
A scent?

52
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:23,750
It's him again.

53
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,833
His body's almost frozen.

54
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:28,416
Just leave him.
It's what he deserves.

55
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:32,416
How can you say that, knowing
how important he is to Blue?

56
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,125
If we don't do something,
he's gonna die.

57
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:39,250
[TOBOE] We couldn't do anything
to save Blue, either, remember?

58
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:40,500
[gasps]

59
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:48,000
[TSUME]
Would you stop it?!

60
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:50,208
Don't take it out on him.

61
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:58,041
We're looking for Kiba,
right? Then let's go.

62
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:01,541
Toboe.

63
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:03,958
[TOBOE] Why don't you go on
ahead. I'll catch up, okay?

64
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:08,791
[HIGE] Don't come cryin' to me
when he wakes up and shoots you.

65
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:09,541
[TSUME]
Hey.

66
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:10,958
Just go on.

67
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:15,666
[TSUME] Don't get too involved.
He's a human, after all.

68
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:40,833
[QUENT grunting]

69
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:42,708
Oh, Blue.

70
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:46,375
There you are, my good girl.

71
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:48,833
Blue...

72
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:52,541
I'm... I'm so sorry...

00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,666

Ruus...

00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:52,041
Who are you?

76
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,458
Who am I?

77
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:56,291
I'm Mew. What's your name?

78
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:04,208
[MEW]
It doesn't really matter.

79
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:08,625
This place doesn't care who you
are or where you came from.

80
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:10,333
[KIBA]
What do you mean by that?

81
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:11,416
Can't you tell?

82
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,291
In this world,
every one can be free.

83
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:31,166
I should've been in
the grave by now.

84
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,541
[HIGE]
The fact of the matter is,

85
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:39,000
it's useless to keep looking.

86
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,166
I mean, do we go back

87
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,875
and search around
the fallen keep again,

88
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:45,416
or go past those huge mountains
and look for him there?

89
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,916
Either way, we still
don't know if he's alive.

90
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,916
[TSUME] I had no idea
you were so worried

91
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,500
about that Blue chick.

92
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:56,000
Hey... Whatta you mean?
I haven't said a word about her.

93
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:57,958
[TSUME] It's because you
haven't said anything.

94
00:08:58,041 --> 00:08:59,583
That proves you're worried.

95
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:02,333
It's not like that.

96
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,416
[gasps]

97
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:12,458
Those are the same guys who
brought down Darcia's keep.

98
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:14,458
Whichever Noble they work for,

99
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:16,291
they're too strong
for us to fight.

100
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:17,416
It's Jaguara.

101
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,458
Jaguara?

102
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:19,750
They must be hers.

103
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:21,958
She's the ruling Noble
to the south.

104
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,416
How do you know?

105
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,750
[HIGE]
I just heard the name, is all.

106
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:29,666
Jaguara. That's what that
human said in the last town.

107
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,166
[HIGE grunts]

108
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:35,041
[TSUME] He made it sound like
she was collecting wolves.

109
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:38,333
But why the hell would
she want to do that?

110
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:51,791

Are you one of
Jaguara's flunkies?

117
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,208
Why is she after us?
What the hell does she want?!

118
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:31,916
Jaguara...?

119
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,875
[TSUME] She's capturing wolves
and I wanna know why!

120
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:40,791
[IYEK laughs]

121
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,916
[TOBOE]
What's the deal?

122
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Why are you laughing at us?!

123
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:48,250
[IYEK]
If you're wolves

124
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:50,916
you shoulda just said
so in the first place.

125
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,916
That's just great. The elder's
gonna have my hide for this.

126
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,625
[IYEK] Sorry about that.
Y'see, some of our friends

127
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:05,166
were attacked last night and
we just assumed it was you.

128
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,416
[TSUME]
Well, it wasn't.

129
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,250
[IYEK] I know. It couldn't
have been wolves.

130
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:11,375
For one thing, they used guns.

131
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:15,250
Besides, we of the Hmong
tribe believe in wolves.

132
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,458
In their existence
and their spirit.

133
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:19,375
[TOBOE]
Believe in us...?

134
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:21,291
[IYEK]
Well, here we are.

135
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,166
[BOY laughs]

136
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,500
[TOBOE]
Everyone lives here?

137
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:34,375
Together, I mean?

138
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:37,083
Yeah. We travel
around as a unit.

139
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:38,041
[TOBOE]
Wow.

140
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,291
Is that so unusual?

141
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:42,208
We live together by
treating every thing

142
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:44,583
as equally as the
next, that's all.

143
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:48,041
Horses and dogs and humans.

144
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:51,083
[IYEK]
So, How's he doing?

145
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:52,416
He's better now.

146
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,958
And he stopped whimpering.

147
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:57,083
[GIRL 2] He drank a whole bunch
of milk a little while ago.

148
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:58,000
He did?!

00:11:58,083 --> 00:11:59,958
[GIRLS giggle]

150
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:03,416
Is he one of your friends
who was attacked?

151
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,958
[IYEK] I don't know if they
were poachers, or what,

152
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:08,166
they just hurt
the dogs and left.

153
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,208
This one kept fighting
up until the very end.

154
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:12,791
We know who might
have done this.

155
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:13,458
[TOBOE]
Huh?

156
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:15,250
That old human.

157
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:16,458
But he couldn't have!

158
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,375
That guy was half frozen.

159
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:21,416
Besides, he knows the difference
between a wolf and a dog.

160
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,208
How come you're trying so
hard to protect that geezer?

161
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:25,916
[TOBOE]
Uh...

162
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,666
He was talking in his sleep.

163
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,833
He said, "Blue, I'm so sorry".

164
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:36,333
Maybe, if they mistook
the dogs for wolves...

165
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:37,666
Jaguara then?

166
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,166
[HIGE] She might be killing
anything she can get

167
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,541
her hands on, even if it
only looks like a wolf.

168
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:47,250
[TSUME] You mentioned earlier
about "believing in wolves."

169
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,083
What exactly did
you mean by that?

170
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:52,333
What'd I mean?
I meant what I said.

171
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:55,125
Wolves are the ancestors
of every human being.

172
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,083
Except the Nobles,
of course.

173
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:58,208
[ELDER]
Iyek.

174
00:12:58,291 --> 00:12:59,458
[IYEK]
Yes, elder.

175
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:03,166
Bring along our
guests, won't you?

176
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:10,125
Don't follow me.

177
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:11,458
But, why not?

178
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,208
Aren't you terrified of me?

179
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:14,208
Not a bit.

180
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:15,958
I'm a wolf, y'know.

181
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:18,583
Well, isn't that obvious, silly?

182
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,958
[MEW laughing]

183
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,833
[KIBA]
Is this... Paradise?

184
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:13,458
[MEW]
Paradise?

185
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:15,458
[KIBA]
A place where you can be free.

186
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:17,875
I've been searching
for it my whole life.

187
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:21,875
[MEW] If that's what you think
it is, then it must be.

188
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:25,250
This is a Paradise
meant just for you.

189
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,500
[gasps]

190
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:40,958
[gasps]

191
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:45,625
Kiba.

192
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:48,291
Will you stay with
me here, forever?

193
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:55,208
If this really is your Paradise,

194
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:57,416
would you stay
with me like this?

195
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,791
[KIBA] You and I.
We're different species.

196
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:02,041
But I can sense your feelings.

197
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:04,833
And you can sense mine.

198
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:06,666
Are you scared?

199
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:08,583
I'm not scared...

200
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:09,916
of anything.

201
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,041
Not even the thought
of dying scares me.

202
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:17,458
Since I was born, death's
been nipping at my heels.

203
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:22,708
It's as if my very birth had
somehow called it there.

204
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:29,291
[howling]

205
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:35,125
[MAN OF THE COLD FIRE]
Kiba... The white soul...

206
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:38,166
Do you wish to speak with me?

207
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,666
[KIBA]
Why did I survive?

208
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:44,250
I've asked myself that
a hundred times.

209
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:49,625
There must be some reason for
me to be here, but what is it?

210
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:53,458
I keep hearing this voice,
from deep within me.

211
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:55,875
It says I can no
longer stay here.

212
00:16:55,958 --> 00:17:02,416
The time has come for you
to set out on a journey.

213
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,916
You did not survive on your own.

214
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,791
The flowers protected you,

215
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:09,750
and the land spared your life.

216
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:13,458
Listen well to the
words of your soul.

217
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:17,250
Your destiny must lie in a
different place than this.

218
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:19,000
[KIBA]
A different place?

219
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:21,916
You must leave this land,

220
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,125
and never look back.

221
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:37,291
[KIBA] I've spent every waking
moment searching for it,

222
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:39,333
for where I'm meant to be.

223
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:48,583
[KIBA]
It's so strange...

224
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:49,750
[MEW]
Hm?

225
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:50,833
[KIBA]
Bein' able to talk

226
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:53,708
about everything that's
happened to me.

227
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:57,166
I guess I've never really
opened up to anyone before.

228
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:00,666
Not to my friends,
or even Cheza.

229
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:05,791
For the first time in my entire
life, I'm finally at peace.

230
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:08,625
It's here. This is Paradise.

231
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:10,375
It must be.

232
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:19,291
[ELDER] Long ago, back when
man was still an animal,

233
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:22,791
there were evil monsters
who ravished this world.

234
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:25,708
Mother Earth opened
the gates to Paradise

235
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:28,916
and set the wolves
upon the land.

236
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,208
The wolves fought bravely
against the evil

237
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:34,666
and vanquished the monsters.

238
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,791
To the ignorant man-beasts
that remained,

239
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:42,166
they taught many things, and
from part of their own bodies,

240
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,708
the wolves created humanity.

241
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,208
This tale has been passed
down in our tribe

242
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:49,000
since ancient times.

243
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:51,541
You mean, humans were
created from wolves?

244
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:53,166
[ELDER]
Yes, little one.

245
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,625
Back when the world was
young, as you are now.

246
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:59,250
When the wolves
seek out Paradise,

247
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:01,666
this world will come to an end.

248
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,833
Or perhaps the world will
end because of their search

249
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:06,625
as they make their way home.

250
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:09,833
It is unclear which
will happen first.

251
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:13,000
Regardless, when
the wolves find it,

252
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:16,458
everything in this world
will cease to be.

253
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:19,250
Who first began this
search, was it you?

254
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:22,708
Was it my idea? No, sir.

255
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:24,250
[ELDER]
Was it you?

256
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:25,916
Not likely.

257
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,250
[ELDER]
You, then?

258
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:31,791
So, we shouldn't be trying
to find Paradise?

259
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:35,708
I mean, if the world ends,
what'll happen to everyone?

260
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:39,500
As to that, no one
can be certain.

261
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:44,791
No matter where nature goes,
our path is to simply follow.

262
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,583
[TOBOE]
Iyek?

263
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:56,416
It's time for us to take off.

264
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,833
[IYEK]
Already?

265
00:19:57,916 --> 00:20:00,333
We're looking for
a friend of ours.

266
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:03,750
But we can't seem to
pick up his scent.

267
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:06,291
Do you know what lies
beyond those mountains?

268
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:09,916
[IYEK] A dangerous land.
No one goes there.

269
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,458
So, It's a place that no one
else would be able to find, huh?

270
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:16,916
Let's go.

271
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:19,666
[IYEK]
Beyond those rocks is a land

272
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,375
called the "Desert's Bones."

273
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:23,208
[TSUME]
Why the Desert's Bones?

274
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:26,125
[IYEK] The earth is so parched,
even the sand has left it.

275
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:29,708
But, it is said whoever ventures
in experiences true happiness.

276
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:32,583
[HIGE] Why the hell would you
find happiness in a desert?

277
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:34,375
[IYEK]
The spirits of the land tell us

278
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:36,000
there's a patch of giant grass

279
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:38,875
that's been growing there
for thousands of years.

280
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,958
It guides anyone who
rests beneath it

281
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:42,708
to the Garden of Eternity.

282
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:44,375
[HIGE]
Garden of Eternity?

283
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,500
[TOBOE] Do you think
that could be Paradise?

284
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:47,916
[IYEK]
I don't know.

285
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,208
No one who's gone there
has ever returned,

286
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:53,541
so we don't really know
what the place is like.

287
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:56,291
Why don't all of you stay
here and live with our tribe?

288
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:58,166
I'm afraid we can't do that.

289
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:02,333
Y'see our friend is the one who
was looking for Paradise.

290
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:05,125
See ya 'round. Let's go.

291
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:11,041
I'm... not going.

292
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:13,125
I...

293
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,916
I wanna stay here.

294
00:23:18,083 --> 00:23:20,875
[QUENT] A man needs something
to satisfy his soul.

295
00:23:20,958 --> 00:23:23,125
Booze? No, not booze.

296
00:23:23,208 --> 00:23:24,125
Love.

297
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:25,833
No matter how old he gets,

298
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:28,333
man lives his life
in love with love.

299
00:23:28,416 --> 00:23:31,375
Regardless of what reality
has to say on the matter.
