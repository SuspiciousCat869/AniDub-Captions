Okay. I'll hold you to that.

reminder of my sin.

168
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,625
[TSUME]
I ran.

169
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,083
My friends were
being slaughtered

170
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,583
and I abandoned them.

171
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:01,333
[snarls]

172
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,583
[TSUME]
They knew what I'd done...

173
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,750
...and banished
me from the pack.

174
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,958
[TSUME]
I didn't need any friends.

175
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:16,250
I never trusted them.

176
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:19,291
All I ever did was betray
the people around me.

177
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:22,750
[TSUME]
Until I met the three of you.

178
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:30,458
[TSUME] I wanted...
to take you to Paradise.

179
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:35,041
You were the one...
who brought me all way here.

180
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:38,333
[TOBOE]
Come on, Tsume, let's go!

181
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:40,791
I believed in you.

182
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:44,708
I won't whine anymore,
and I won't run away.

183
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,958
Yeah... I know, kid.

184
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:50,416
I know.

185
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,666
[TSUME]
Old man?

186
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,541
Take care of the runt for me.

187
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:02,125
See ya.

188
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:15,208
[HUBB pangts]

189
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:17,958
Am I the only one
having trouble breathing?

190
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:20,375
No. We all are.

191
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,583
[BLUE] I think it's
'cause we're so high up.

192
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,458
[CHEZA]
We are almost there.

193
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:27,708
The Tree of All Seeds is
up ahead, waiting for us.

194
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:32,166
[sighs]

195
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:05,291
The Tree of All Seeds has
been alive this whole time.

196
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:08,291
It has felt the world's pain.

197
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:10,166
But no longer.

198
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,500
It can breathe freely now.

199
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:23,125
[HUBB gasps]

200
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:30,833
We thank you.

[HUBB laughs]

202
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,916
The Darcia family crest?

[gasps]

204
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,875
[gasps]
The Tower of the Seal.

205
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:56,416
That's what this place is.

206
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,541
According to the
<i>Book of the Moon</i> ,

207
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:03,208
the Nobles built it in order to
seal off the wolves' Paradise.

208
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,458
[KIBA]
Seal?

209
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:07,625
"The seal is broken."

210
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:09,458
That's what he said to me.

211
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:10,500
[HIGE gasps]

212
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:11,791
And his face...

213
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:14,041
He was starting
to turn into a wolf.

214
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:15,875
You mean Darcia?!

215
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:18,791
One of his eyes is gold.
It's a wolf's eye.

216
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:20,208
He could see it.

217
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:23,000
He knew Jaguara's
Paradise wasn't real.

218
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:26,083
So he gave up on trying
to go there himself.

219
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:27,375
He wants ours.

220
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:30,166
That's why he's trying
to become a wolf.

221
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,791
[gasps]

222
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:35,458
And what if he opens
Paradise first?

223
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,583
Then our future will be lost.

224
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,375
Hey, in that book,

225
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:45,708
is there any description
of what Paradise is like?

226
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:48,458
I've checked,
but there's nothing.

227
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:53,166
It should say at the end,
but the last page is blank.

228
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,458
There it is.

229
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,750
The first mountain.

230
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:59,500
That is the entrance
to Paradise.

Hey, mister, Are you okay?

Uh, yeah, fine.

235
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:46,291
Go ahead, don't worry about me.

236
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,541
I'll be up there
before you know it.

237
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:52,000
Just a little further's a
ledge where you can rest.

[ALL gasp]

244
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,625
[DARCIA] I tell you now
the words of Red Moon.

245
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:25,750
From the Great Spirit
was born the wolf

246
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:28,416
and man became its messenger.

247
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,416
The beast lives
his life in silence,

248
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,583
abiding where the blessing
of the blood of the Gods

249
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:36,458
is bestowed upon him.

250

Hey!

251
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,583
Don't let go!

[HUBB] So much for the
tough talking human.

253
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:48,000
I guess... I won't make it
to Paradise after all.

254
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:50,500
It's too bad. I wanted...

255
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:53,625
...to see this through
with you to the end.

256
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:57,208
But, this is as far...
as I can go.

257
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:58,750
No! You've got to hang on!

258
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:01,208
Stay there! Don't come down!

00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:05,291
It's okay.

00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:08,458
I'm not afraid of dying.

00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:13,041
You wolves... will open
up the next world for us.

00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:17,125
I believe that now,
more than anything.

263
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:21,458
Well I guess... I didn't
need the gun after all.

after winning the favor

It was a long trip,
but now that it's over,

it seemed like the
blink of an eye.
