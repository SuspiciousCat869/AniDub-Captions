1
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:31,375
It's Jaguara's troops.

2
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:16,875
[HUBB] Are you crazy?!
I can't afford that much!

3
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:18,666
[HUBB groaning]

4
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:22,166
Hey, wait a minute!

5
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,750
Not very good at
hagglin', are ya?

6
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:26,583
Well, then help me out here!

7
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:29,166
It wasn't my car that
broke down, now was it?

8
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,500
You're gonna ride
in it, aren't you?!

9
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:33,833
[HUBB]
Hm?

10
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,291
[HUBB] You want that
much, for this?!

11
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:40,500
[LAD]
Believe me pal,

12
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:42,416
you won't find a better
car in this village.

13
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,375
Why do I feel like
I'm being screwed.

14
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:46,125
Tell you what, if you want,

15
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:49,583
I can fill 'er up with enough
gas to get you to the next town.

16
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:52,958
[sighs] For how much?

17
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:55,583
Boy, you catch on quick.

18
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,875
Terrific, now I'm broke.

19
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:01,708
Ah, look on the bright side.

20
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:03,291
Least you got a car that works.

21
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:05,083
Assuming it does.

22
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,458
[TOBOE]
They went that way, right?

23
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,000
They sure did...

24
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:25,541
[TOBOE]
Are we going?

25
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:28,625
Well, yeah, we have to.

26
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,375
So where are you guys headed?

27
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:35,958
We're all tryin' to make
our way to Paradise.

28
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,375
Paradise?

29
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:41,000
It's something every
wolf has to try to do.

30
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:43,708
Oh, right, to find Paradise.

31
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:45,375
You're gonna come with us.

32
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:46,958
Aren't ya, Blue?

33
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:50,750
It sounds tempting,
but I can't go.

34
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:53,166
Well, then I'm not
goin', either.

35
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,000
Hige.

36
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:57,583
[KIBA] You know, you'd
probably be better off

37
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:59,916
if you stayed with the humans.

38
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,875
It's not too late to go back.

39
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:04,000
What the hell are
you sayin', Kiba?!

40
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:07,333
I have no intension
of going back.

41
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:10,166
I can never return to
the way I was before.

42
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,875
Not now.

43
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:13,666
Blue...

44
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,833
[BLUE]
I just,

45
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:18,041
I need to find out
what I really am.

46
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:23,125
Well then, the only thing
you can do is move forward.

47
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:26,000
Yeah, he's right! Ya
gotta move forward!

48
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:27,375
Right? Right?

49
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:30,083
[TSUME] Oh, yeah, I can see
right through ya, porky.

50
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:32,375
Now if only Cheza were with us.

51
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:33,708
U-Uh!

52
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,750
I told you not to say that!

53
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,958
Okay. Now that
everything's settled,

54
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:39,833
time to get a move on!

55
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:40,958
On to Paradis--!

56
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:43,125
We're going this way.

57
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:45,125
[TOBOE]
Paradise isn't over there.

58
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:47,125
But Darcia's keep is.

59
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:48,041
His keep?

60
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:49,000
Yeah.

61
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:51,750
D'you think Cheza's there?

62
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:57,000
Kiba, Cheza left us of her
own free will, you know.

63
00:04:57,083 --> 00:05:00,750
She only did that
to protect us.

64
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:03,166
She's waiting for us,
I know she is.

65
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,000
[TSUME]
That Noble will be there, too.

66
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,291
[KIBA]
I wouldn't doubt it.

67
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:10,500
[TSUME] We all might
get killed this time.

68
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:14,500
If we're meant to die,
then so be it.

69
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:17,833
When that happens,
you'll be on your own.

70
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:20,208
So we're going.
To find Cheza, right?

71
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:22,458
Right. Let's go.

72
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,666
[HIGE]
C'mon.

73
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,791
[HUBB groaning]

74
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:55,583
[QUENT] You're gonna
give yourself wrinkles

75
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:57,875
if you keep that up, lover-boy.

76
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,666
[HUBB]
My head is killin' me.

77
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,291
I usually don't drink that much.

78
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:03,458
[QUENT laughs]

79
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:05,625
[HUBB] Well, you're
certainly in a good mood.

80
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,916
[QUENT] Come on, don't
you think it's hilarious?

81
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
[HUBB]
What is?

82
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:11,708
Here I am trackin'
a pack of wolves,

83
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:14,500
and here you are chasin' a fox.

84
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:19,375
[laughs] We make
one hell of a team.

85
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:23,291
[QUENT] But what's funny is
you're the one who's afraid.

86
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:25,083
You're scared to find her.

87
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:27,500
Would you please get off me?!

88
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:31,125
"Please get off." [laughs]

89
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:34,416
Excuse me, my chickadee.

90
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:36,291
[QUENT]
That's right,

91
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,375
women always run
when you chase 'em.

92
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:41,958
It's been that way
since the dawn of time.

93
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:47,666
How about you drive for a while.

94
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,375
[QUENT]
Huh?

95
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:49,666
We've got a ways to go.

96
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,208
So we'll take turns
behind the wheel.

97
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:54,750
What the hell kind of dumb
thing is that for a cop to say!

98
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:58,208
You're gonna let a
drunken man drive?!

99
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:04,000
So how about now?

100
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:05,375
You're outta yer mind.

101
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,583
And you're forgetting
that I'm not just a cop,

102
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:10,250
I'm also a wanted fugitive.

103
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:17,250
[QUENT growls]
Fine, whatever. See if I care.

104
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:18,500
[HUBB]
Here.

105
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,041
What is it?

106
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:22,208
[HUBB] Swallow it.
It's a sobriety pill.

107
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:23,541
You're kidding,

108
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,791
It breaks down the alcohol
in your system.

109
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:28,291
And it starts working
almost immediately.

110
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:31,416
There are a few side effects,
but nothing to worry about.

111
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,083
It'll let you drive
with a clear head.

112
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:34,791
Why the hell should
I take this thing

113
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:36,958
when I got a perfectly
good buzz goin'?!

114
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,375
It's a damn waste,

115
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,208
Would you prefer if
I left you here?

116
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:50,875
You've had enough!

117
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:51,958
Careful.

118
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:53,541
Now just keep your
eyes on the road.

119
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:58,250
An attentive driver never
regrets the accident he avoids.

120
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:00,541
Do you always have
to talk like a cop?

121
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:03,333
You're on the force,
too, as I recall.

122
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,375
[HUBB] For cryin' out loud, what
would make a man like you

123
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:09,875
want to become a sheriff?

124
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:14,333
[QUENT] Heh. All right then,
what made you become a cop?

125
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:15,875
My folks.

126
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:19,833
Like a good little boy, I did
what I was told. That's all.

127
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:23,375
[laughs] Daddy's little
trooper, huh?

128
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,500
Come on.

129
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,750
Leave some for me, will ya?

130
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:31,666
[HUBB] My parents used to
gang up and lecture me.

131
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,541
"Now Hubb, don't go
getting into trouble."

132
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,416
"There are rules in this world."

133
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,750
"Stick to the rules and
you can never go wrong."

134
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:40,875
[QUENT laughs]

135
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,583
[HUBB]
You think that's funny?

136
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,833
Nothing was ever funny to me.

137
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:46,458
I did exactly what they said,

138
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:49,500
and followed every
rule in the book.

139
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,666
But I still...

140
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,666
Don't chug it!

141
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,791
[coughing]

142
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:58,083
When did I take a wrong turn?

143
00:08:58,166 --> 00:08:59,791
Where the hell did I go wrong?

144
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:03,750
[sighs] So, that include
your marriage?

145
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:04,958
What?

146
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:07,125
Was gettin' married
your parent's idea, too?

147
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:10,375
No, Cher and I were, well,

148
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:12,958
we first met through
a friend of mine.

149
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,666
It was love at first sight.

150
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,208
Huh?

151
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:21,166
[QUENT laughs]

152
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:27,791
--[HUBB coughing]
--[trickling]

153
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,708
You haven't done
anything wrong,

154
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:31,791
and despite your
concerted efforts,

155
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:35,958
believe me, you ain't
such a good little boy.

156
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:42,083
[QUENT]
Didn't you say somethin'

157
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:44,708
about there bein' side
effects to that thing?

158
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:47,291
I'm pissin' a freakin'
river here.

159
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:58,208
Can't see a thing. Damn it.

160
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:04,875
Can't hear, either.
What a night.

161
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:06,833
[QUENT gasps]

162
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:10,500
[QUENT]
Blue!

163
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:12,541
[panting]

164
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:22,250
[HUBB]
What's the matter?!

165
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:25,000
[QUENT]
Forget it. It was nothing.

166
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,375
[BOTH gasp]

167
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:57,708
Damn you!

168
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:02,166
You bastards!

169
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,500
[QUENT] Why the hell
are you so frustrated?

170
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:08,458
[HUBB groans]
Can't you see what's going on?

171
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:11,041
Somewhere out there,
I don't know...

172
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:13,333
Something's happening.

173
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,250
You may think

174
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:19,250
that something unknown is
just playin' games with you,

175
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:22,791
that you're the only one who's
being kept out of the loop.

176
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:26,375
Trust me, that's not the case.

177
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:31,125
All you're doing is watchin'
the scenery go by.

178
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:49,166
[HUBB]
Cher.

179
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,500
You're so beautiful.

180
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:23,791
Sleepy head.

181
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:25,291
Time to wake up.

182
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:27,291
Hey, Hubb.

183
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:29,166
Wake up.

184
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:34,583
[gasps]

185
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,791
There's drool on your chin.

186
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:40,208
You've been smilin'
since you fell asleep.

187
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:44,166
That must have been one
hell of a good dream.

188
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:48,916
No. It was just another sad one.

189
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,583
It's your turn to
take the wheel.

190
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,375
[HUBB] It was two years
after we were married.

191
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:58,583
Cher got a scouting offer from
the Noble's science division

192
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:01,583
to head up their
new research lab.

193
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,041
So, Hubb,

194
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:05,250
what do you think?

195
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:06,833
I dunno.

196
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:09,541
I've never really understood how
the professional world works.

197
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:12,500
How do you feel about it?
You want it, don't you?

198
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:13,708
Yes.

199
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:15,333
It's a big opportunity.

200
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:16,708
And where I am now,

201
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:19,458
I'm already seeing the
limits of my research.

202
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:21,083
Besides...

203
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,416
I could use a change.

204
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,333
Maybe it would get me out of
the rut I've been in lately.

205
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:30,916
You, in a rut?

206
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,625
If you are, then
it's news to me.

207
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:37,041
Cher, you're more alive
than anyone I know.

208
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,000
Do you think so?

209
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:42,500
'Course I do.

210
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:43,875
I guess,

211
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:46,666
I've never really given it
much thought, you know?

212
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,791
About my life, and
what I want to do.

213
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:51,833
Hubb, what about you?

214
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:54,250
You mean what do I want?

215
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:04,083
Look. Just do whatever
you want to do, Cher.

216
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:07,458
I'll be here,
whatever you decide.

217
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:12,916
[HUBB]
Gradually,

218
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,541
she became more and more
absorbed in her research.

219
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:18,083
[QUENT] And like two ships
that pass in the night,

220
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:19,791
you got a divorce.

221
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:21,875
Hm. Talk about cliché.

222
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:23,208
Why couldn't you stop it?

223
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:24,083
[HUBB]
Cheza.

224
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:25,458
[QUENT]
Mm?

225
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:27,416
After a while that was
all she could talk about.

226
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,666
Night and day it was
Cheza, Cheza, Cheza.

227
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,708
Cheza?

228
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:33,458
What the hell is that?

229
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:35,041
[HUBB]
An entity.

230
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:39,083
An original life form created by
highly advanced biotechnology.

231
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:40,291
What do you mean?

232
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:41,791
Well, rom what she told me,

233
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:44,083
she was working on
a research organism

234
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:47,416
that could adapt to and survive
in any given environment.

235
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,125
There was something
about it being created

236
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:53,875
by weaving it from the
essence of a special plant.

237
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,583
The essence of a plant?

238
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:59,250
Made into the form
of a beautiful girl.

239
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:02,750
Beautiful, just like a flower.

240
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:04,083
[gasps]

241
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:05,000
Huh?

242
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:07,208
Hey! Why'd the car stop?

243
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:10,333
It can't possibly be
my turn to drive yet!

244
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:14,541
Quent, why did the car stop?

245
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,208
What a piece of junk.

246
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:23,000
Hey, Quent, I could use
a little help, y'know?!

247
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:38,791
[QUENT] The flower
maiden and the wolves.

248
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,625
It couldn't be.

249
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:50,375
[QUENT]
All right.

250
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:52,458
How 'bout we meet back
here at nightfall.

251
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:53,791
[HUBB]
Sure.

252
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:57,041
We can decide then whether
or not to get a hotel.

253
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:58,333
So what's your plan?

254
00:16:58,416 --> 00:16:59,708
How're ya gonna find her?

255
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:02,500
I'll just act like a cop and
start walkin' the beat.

256
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:03,833
[QUENT]
Heh.

257
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,125
[QUENT]
Fight hard for her,

258
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:09,958
or you'll always regret
what could've been.

259
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,375
[BOTH grunting]

260
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:48,208
[ELMIRA]
Oh, thank you so much!

261
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:50,000
You really helped us out.

262
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:53,000
Please, could we offer
you a cup of coffee?

263
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:55,666
[QUENT]
No, that's all right

264
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,708
[OLD MAN]
Now. Don't be like that.

265
00:17:57,791 --> 00:18:01,083
If we add a little add a little
rum it'll warm your bones.

266
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:01,958
Well,

267
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:03,791
I guess just one.

268
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:06,083
[ELMIRA] So tell us,
where are you headed?

269
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:08,750
[QUENT] Uh. Well, actually,
we only just arrived.

270
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:11,916
[ELMIRA] Sorry to disappoint
you but there's not much here.

271
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,666
Why don't you try the castle
of the Darcias in the west?

272
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:18,000
It sits in the middle of
a lake. It's quite lovely.

273
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:20,458
I didn't exactly come
out here for pleasure.

274
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:24,416
We're off to visit our daughter
and that new husband of hers.

275
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,291
But, hun, Jessica isn't...

276
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:29,583
Well. She's gone, Dear.

277
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:32,125
I wonder if they've
left town already.

278
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,000
Those wolves, I mean.

279
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:35,583
The what?!

280
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:37,000
Oh, it's' nothing.

281
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:40,083
My husband mistook some
boys for wolves.

282
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:41,916
Mistook them?

283
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,166
Don't be silly, Elmira.

284
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,375
They were wolves, all right.

285
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,916
In all my years,

286
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,583
they're the first living
wolves I've ever met.

287
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:51,541
Please, dear...

288
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:53,625
And the pretty black one,

289
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:56,666
you could tell how attached
to people she was.

290
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:02,250
It felt as if my own daughter
was there at my side.

291
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,041
Blue...

292
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,083
[gasps]

293
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:48,750
Hubb!

294
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,125
Cher!

295
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:57,333
Hubb, what are you...

296
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:59,125
How did you...

297
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:01,291
Is this a dream?

298
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:02,291
I can't tell,

299
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:04,833
I've had so many
dreams about you.

300
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,541
[HUBB]
Lord Orkham's been killed.

301
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:12,791
[CHER]
Oh.

302
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:16,083
On the way into town I
saw a military caravan.

303
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:19,458
But I don't have the slightest
idea where they were headed.

304
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:22,458
I think something insane
is about to happen.

305
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:23,625
[CHER]
No,

306
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:25,666
it's been insane all along.

307
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,666
All along? Oh...

308
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,958
Please, Cher. I need to know.

309
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:31,416
What are you trying to do?

310
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,000
I'm going to Lord
Darcia's keep.

311
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:35,583
[HUBB]
Darcia's keep?

312
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:36,833
But why?

313
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:37,958
Because...

314
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,791
That's where Cheza is.

315
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:41,666
No.

316
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:42,666
You're wrong.

317
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,791
I'm not wrong! I saw her.

318
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:46,666
But, no, I...

319
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,416
What else did you see?

320
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,666
Why won't you look
me in the eye?

321
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,833
I met him.

322
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:55,416
I met Darcia.

323
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,958
[HUBB whimpers]

324
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:58,291
[CHER]
I'm sorry, Hubb.

325
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:00,458
I can't tell you how happy I am

326
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:03,625
that you came all this
way to find me,

327
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:05,125
but I have to go.

328
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:06,041
But why, Cher?!

329
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:07,666
[CHER]
I don't know why.

330
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:11,125
It's just... It's something
that I have to do.

331
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:13,166
Please, try and understand,

332
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:16,000
I have to find out
Cheza's true purpose.

333
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:17,666
I'm being drawn to
something, Hubb,

334
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:20,583
and I need to know what it is.

335
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:23,000
All right, then
I'll go with you.

336
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:32,166
Then why the hell did you leave
this thing for me to read?!

337
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,583
I'm going with you.

338
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:40,458
Huh?

339
00:23:18,083 --> 00:23:20,958
[TOBOE] "There are times in your
life when you shouldn't drink.

340
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:23,541
At work and behind the wheel."

341
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:25,500
Hey, that's a great idea!

342
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:28,375
We should drive there,
too! We can't?!

343
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:30,916
What, none of you
guys has a license?
