[laughing]

2
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:03,708
This feels great.

3
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:09,500
The sunlight is so peaceful.
How I've missed it.

4
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:20,291
My love, what're you looking at?

5
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:23,791
How beautifully your hair
shines in the sunlight.

6
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:28,833
And your eyes. So gentle.
And so full of love.

7
00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:33,041
I wish to engrave this
image of you in my heart,

8
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:36,500
so that this moment
will last forever.

9
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:38,041
But why?

10
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:40,583
We are always
together, you and I.

11
00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:45,166
And we always will be.
Together until the end of time.

12
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:49,291
Hamona. Beautiful Hamona.

13
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:53,000
Dearest, I will
give you my word.

14
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:56,875
I promise that one day I
will take you to Paradise.

15
00:01:58,291 --> 00:01:59,875
[HAMONA]
No.

16
00:01:59,958 --> 00:02:03,708
For me, this is Paradise.

17
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:08,291
When you and I are together,
wherever we are,

18
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:10,916
that is always Paradise to me.

19
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:37,541
[DARCIA]
Huh?

20
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:52,416
My Lord, the Lady
Hamona has fallen ill.

21
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,875
Paradise sickness?

22
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:57,666
[NEIGE]
Her soul is slowly fading away.

23
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:02,625
[DARCIA]
Are you telling me

24
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:05,208
she has the curse of my clan?

25
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:14,750
[DARCIA]
You are my only hope.

26
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:18,541
You must guide this
miserable soul from despair.

27
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:25,958
[DARCIA]
Cheza, the Flower Maiden.

28
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,791
[HIGE]
C'mon, runt!

29
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:17,208
Get a move on or
we'll leave you behind!

30
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:22,125
[TOBOE] Hey, doesn't this forest
seem kinda strange to you?

31
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:24,291
There aren't any animals around.

32
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:27,916
Tell me somethin', you do know
that you're a wolf, right?

33
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,625
[TOBOE]
Huh?

34
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:29,958
Think about it, genius.

35
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,541
They probably ran off
when they saw us comin'.

36
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,750
Oh, of course.

37
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:37,583
This is the problem with
takin' city kids to the woods.

38
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:40,458
I was thinkin'. I haven't
smelled the Flower at all

39
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,750
since we left that cave.

40
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:46,208
I wonder if this is
really the right way.

41
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:48,291
You wanna give us a clue here?

42
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:49,958
Sure.

43
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:51,916
Where exactly are we headed?

44
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,083
To Paradise.

45
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:57,875
And just what in the hell
is guiding you there?

46
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,791
I'm goin' on instinct.

47
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,791
Here we go again.

48
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,583
I just wish at least it felt
like we were getting closer.

49
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,833
Not that I'm complaining
or anything.

50
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:14,916
[distant humming]

51
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,791
That noise.

52
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:20,250
It's an airship. It must
be the one of the Noble's.

53
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:22,666
Ugh. I hate that sound.

54
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:38,625
[DARCIA] We're getting close.
Can you sense it?

55
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:41,166
That castle is
where you were born.

56
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:53,916
So they're here.

57
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:03,541
It's a faint signal,
but it's moving.

58
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:06,875
Commander, she must be
somewhere inside that vessel.

59
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:08,625
[COMMANDER]
Can you be certain?

60
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:11,250
I'm sure. These
readings confirm it.

61
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:14,500
Cheza is awake and she's
reacting to something.

62
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:16,666
It's been over a month
since she was stolen.

63
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,291
There's no telling if she's
alive, let alone awake.

64
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,541
[CHER]
He's not going to kill her.

65
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:24,416
It was him we took her away
from in the first place.

66
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:28,875
And now, gentlemen, it is our
sole objective to retrieve it.

67
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:30,666
Fire a warning shot.

68
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:01,000
[TOBOE yelps]

69
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:01,875
What's goin' on?!

70
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:03,875
Man, they're really goin' at it.

71
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:06,916
She's there.

72
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:12,125
Hold it! It's nothing to
do with us! Stay out of it!

73
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:13,791
I can feel it.

74
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,333
Feel what?

75
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:19,833
I'm not sure.
But it's so familiar.

76
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,666
Come on, don't you guys
feel anything at all?!

77
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:24,916

78
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,916

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,791
That guy is hopeless.

80

[KIBA]
The Flower Maiden.

00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:42,833
Look at these readings.

83
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:45,541
Yes, sir!

84

Cheza.

85
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:21,500
Don't do it!

86
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,708
Oh, no!

[TSUME]
Kiba!

00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:07,583
[TOBOE]
Wait for us!

89
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:09,750
That scent.

00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:15,041
[sniffing]

91
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:18,708
The scent is faint,
but it's up there.

92
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,666
Why in the hell are
you so worked up?

93
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,125
Aw, man.

94
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:29,500
It's got the stink of a
Noble mixed in there, too.

95
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:30,916
A Noble?

96
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:37,583
[TOBOE]
Hey, Kiba!

97
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:41,125
Umm. I got this fluttery
feeling in my chest.

98
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:42,833
Is that what you meant?

99
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:44,916
Let's go.

100
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:56,708
[RETRIEVAL LEADER] The crest
of the House of Darcia.

101
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,625
Was this their stronghold?

102
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,125
[CHER]
From I understand,

103
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:03,375
this was just one of many
villas the Darcia Family had.

104
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:06,083
But that was years ago.

105
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:08,041
Yeah, they were
cursed by Paradise

106
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:10,291
and the family fell into ruin.

107
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:12,833
Soon this place'll fall, too.

108
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:14,958
The town is a match
for the Flower Habitat

109
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:17,541
that was depicted in
the <i>Book of the Moon.</i>

110
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:21,250
Cheza was born right here.

111
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:24,875
Still, it's hard to imagine
that Lunar Flowers ever bloomed

112
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,250
on this devastated mountaintop.

113
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:39,958
I don't know why, but
my heart is pounding.

114
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:42,500
And I feel all warm
and tingly inside.

115
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:45,375
This is that cool feeling y'get

116
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:47,708
before pouncin'
on a pretty girl.

117
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,416
Don't let your guard down.

118
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,208
But there's shiver
up my spine, too.

[TOBOE gasps]

[ALL gasp]

121
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:44,166
It's her. It's really her.

122
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,208
My heart just skipped a beat.

123
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:47,583
Who is that?

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,958
Hold on!

Aw, I wanna be
held like that.

Yeah.

130

That's her. That's
the Flower Maiden.

What's goin' on?

00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,208
[CHER]
I don't know.

133
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:10,000
Whatever it is, it's
coming from the garden.

134
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:14,000
But the reading's too large,
I can't get an exact fix on it.

135
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:17,458
Surround the garden immediately!
Mobilize all units now!

136

This way! This way!

137
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:28,625
That's Cheza, all right.
That's the Flower Maiden.

138
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:31,791
She's a flower and a maiden?
That's pretty weird.

[HIGE]
Well, the way I heard it,

140
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:35,250
some Nobles with too
much time on their hands

141
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:39,166
made her from a Lunar
Flower in a lab somewhere.

142
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,791
[TSUME] They made a
human from a flower?

Give me a break, you
really believe all that?

[HIGE] Come on, she's standin'
right there, isn't she?

[TOBOE]
Yeah.

146
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:52,916
And she smells nice,
too. Like a flower.

[HIGE]
Well, I for one believe it.

150
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:03,666
I mean, just think about it.

151
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,416
As crazy as it
seemed at the time,

152

Kiba led us straight to
this place on instinct

or whatever you
wanna call it, right?

Even if it is some
big coincidence,

at least it finally feels
like we're one step closer.

It sure does.

No, of course, I don't know why!

00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,958
I need you to surround the area

162
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:38,541
before we lose the signal,
do you understand?!

163
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:58,333
[CHEZA] This one has
been waiting for you.

164
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:02,708
[CHEZA] This one was born
right here in this place

165
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:04,250
for that reason.

166
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,875
Everybody! This one's home!

167
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:35,708
Oh my. There is...
no one here anymore.

168
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:43,750
They... They all...
withered and died...

169
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:55,958
This one... is the
only one left.

170
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,541
[gunshots]

171
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:03,041
Kiba, we're in serious trouble!

172
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,875
I smell humans all
over the place.

173
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,375
I think we're surrounded.

174
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,333
No! It wasn't her!

175
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:18,583
C'mon guys, we don't
have time for this!

176
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:19,916
We have to escape!

177
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,166
Whadd'ya mean escape?
We're surrounded!

178
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,666
Where the hell are
we suppose to go?!

179
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:25,708
[gasps]

180
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:30,875
Where are you going?!

181
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:32,625
Didn't you hear what I said?!

182
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:37,750
What do we do? Huh?

183
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:39,791
We don't have much of a choice.

184
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,458
[HIGE groans]

185
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:44,375
Kiba's lost it this time.

186
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:45,791
[TOBOE]
Hm?

187
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,416
Kiba, wait for me!

188
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,375
[gunshots]

189
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:51,500
[CHER]
Are you trying to kill her?

190
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:52,666
What's going on?

191
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,041
[SQUADMAN]
Sir, we're being attacked by--

192
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:56,416
[click, static]

193
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,791
Someone is trying
to escape with it.

194
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,625
Darcia.

195
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:02,666
[COMMANDER]
Hm?

196
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:05,125
I don't know.

197
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,791
Man. Look at all those guys!

198
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:21,875
[TSUME]
Damn it.

199
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:41,458
[thud]

200
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:48,625
[HIGE]
We're totally screwed!

201
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,416
They've got that end
totally blocked off!

202
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,583
What do we do?

203
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:53,916
If we left her here,
we could get away.

204
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,250
[gasps] Forget it!

205
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:57,291
[gunshots]

206
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:58,375
[TOBOE]
Guys!

207
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:04,125
[CHEZA]
This way!

208
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:13,916
[COMMANDER]
Can you confirm how many?

209
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,291
[RETRIEVAL LEADER] Information
is still being gathered, sir.

210
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:19,083
A couple of reports said
they saw some boys.

211
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:20,333
Some boys?

212
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:21,875
[beeping]

213
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:24,708
Is she close to here?

214
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:26,041
[gusnhots]

215
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:36,458
[RETRIEVAL LEADER]
Let's go!

216
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,208
She... She was smiling.

217
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:47,583
[HIGE]
What the hell?!

218
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,416
It's no use! There's no way
we can get outta here!

219
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,291
We could always
try surrendering.

220
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:58,916
Heh. I'm kidding, I'm kidding!

221
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:05,000
[CHEZA]
This way.

222
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,000
Where did that giant
hole come from?

223
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:18,791
The wall just moved!

224
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:22,083
Hey, I'm not complainin'.
Let's get outta here.

225
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:25,750
Tsume, come on!

226
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:39,125
[RETRIEVAL LEADER]
They vanished?

227
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:41,458
That's impossible!
Start searching!

228
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:21,333
[DARCIA]
Night is a time of sleep.

229
00:23:21,416 --> 00:23:24,791
However, there are some
tales that can only be told

230
00:23:24,875 --> 00:23:27,208
in the dead of night.

231
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:29,375
You seem exhausted as well.
