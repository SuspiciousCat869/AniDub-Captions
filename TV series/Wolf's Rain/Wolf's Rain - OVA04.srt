is a Paradise for wolves alone.

Though opposite in nature,
are we not both wolves?

[DARCIA] Any Paradise I
attempt to open as a Noble,

133

When I saw Jaguara's
Paradise with my wolf's eye,

134
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:17,500
I understood. It was
nothing but an illusion.

135
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,750
Hamona is not there.

136

No, the Hamona I once
loved no longer exists.

00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:42,125
[DARCIA] In this world,
there are wolves

142
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:45,583
and there are creatures that
were created from them.

143
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:48,958
Not all humans were
born from the wolf.

144
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:52,916
There are also those who began
their existence as wolves,

145
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,375
but they abandoned
their true form

146
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:58,541
and embraced the
guise of humanity.

147
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,958
None of them are aware of this.

148
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:03,291
They have forgotten
what they once were

149
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:05,750
and can never change back.

150
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:09,208
And you're telling me that
you actually remembered?!

151
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:11,958
[DARCIA] A simple
notion occurred to me.

152
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:13,625
Everything that's happened

153
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:16,833
was preparing the
path to guide you here.

154
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:18,125
What?

155
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:21,083
[DARCIA] Why do you
think your clan died out,

156
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:24,000
leaving you as
the sole survivor?

157
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,208
[DARCIA]
You never had a pack.

158
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:30,250
You have always been the
uniquely created wolf.

159
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:31,500
[gasps]

160
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,250
[KIBA] That's a load of
crap and you know it!

161
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:37,500
[DARCIA] You were all that was
ever needed to open Paradise.

162
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:41,375
Those mongrels you dragged
with you weren't necessary.

163
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,083
It's true that I was alone.

164
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:49,500
I was always on my own.

165
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,416
But if I'd stayed that way,
the only thing I could open

166
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,166
would be a world that
was meaningless to me.

167
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:58,166
That kind of Paradise,
is nothing.

168
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:01,791
[DARCIA] You've lost everything
that was precious to you.

169
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,916
[KIBA]
I haven't lost anything.

170
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,208
Not my friends, or my pride
as a wolf, nothing!

171
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:13,250
[barking, growling]

172
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:25,208
[barking, growling continue]

173
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,958
[snarling]

174
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:42,791
[growling]

175
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:51,875
[grunting, panting]

176
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:02,916
[growling]

177
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:11,333
[grunting]

178
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,541
[yells]

179
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:27,458
[growls]

180
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:41,916
[KIBA]
Stop it...

181
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,250
Please, stop...

182
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:50,958
[DARCIA chuckles]

183
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:52,583
[gasps]

184
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:56,666
[KIBA gasps]

185
00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:02,416
[CHEZA] What flows through
this one's veins... is poison.

186
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:06,583
And you are not
protected by the flowers.

187
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:10,000
That poison is within you now.

188
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:15,041
[groans]

189
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,458
[DARCIA]
This is it.

190
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:30,500
The entrance to Paradise.

191
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:35,375
[DARCIA laughs]

192
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:38,500
[screams]

193
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,083
[CHEZA]
Ki... ba...

194
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:08,958
[KIBA]
Cheza... where are you?

195
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,208
[KIBA]
Don't try to move.

196
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:21,125
[CHEZA] Kiba. The ice is
spreading fast now.

197
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:23,250
The world will freeze over.

198
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:33,250
[CHEZA]
Soon... this one will disappear.

199
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:38,833
This one, is a
forged Hanabito.

200
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:41,666
This is not this
one's true form.

201
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,833
[KIBA]
Your true form?

202
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:47,333
Now this one can become...

203
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,916
[KIBA]
Cheza...

204
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,875
[CHEZA] The world...
will close up for a while.

205
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:56,708
And we will be apart
from one another.

206
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:59,041
[KIBA]
What should I do?

207
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:02,625
I don't have anything
left to protect.

208
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:04,916
[CHEZA]
We would not have met,

209
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,125
had the flowers
not protected you.

210
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:11,708
Kiba, because you
protected this one,

211
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:17,166
the flowers will return
and bloom once more.

212
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:21,708
So when the
world is reborn...

213
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:26,708
When Paradise opens...
we will meet again.

214
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:34,041
[CHEZA] This one...
will be waiting for you.

215
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:37,000
Find this one...

216
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:44,291
And next time, the Paradise
you hoped for... will be...

217
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,458
Cheza!

218
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:53,958
[gasps]

219
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:07,833
[gasps, sobs]

220
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:20,333
[yells]

221
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:41,083
[KIBA] They say there's no
such place... as Paradise.

222
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:52,875
[KIBA] Even if you search
to the ends of the earth,

223
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,625
There's nothing there.

224
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:01,166
[KIBA]
No matter how far you walk,

225
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,666
it's always the same road.

226
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,458
It just goes on and on.

227
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,166
[KIBA]
But in spite of that...

228
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,500
Why am I so driven to find it?

229
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,791
[KIBA]
I hear someone's voice...

230
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,625
calling to me.
