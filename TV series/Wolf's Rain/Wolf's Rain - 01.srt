1
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:21,958
[WOLF] They say there's no
such place... as Paradise.

2
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:25,083
Even if you search to
the ends of the earth,

3
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:28,083
there's nothing there.

4
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:32,250
No matter how far you walk,
it's always the same road.

5
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:34,583
It just goes on and on.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,500
[WOLF] But in spite of that,
why am I so driven to find it?

7
00:00:58,833 --> 00:01:03,000
[WOLF]
A voice calls to me. It says:

8
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:05,958
"Search for Paradise."

9
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:30,625
Let's go.

10
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:54,333
Hurry up!

11
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:55,625
Dumbass!

12
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:25,000
[clatter]

13
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:31,166
[GEHL]
Tsume!

14
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:50,291
[REBELS cheering]

15
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:01,083
[SEDO]
That's a Noble's ship.

16
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,166
I hate that sound.

17
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,583
[QUENT]
Vodka.

18
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:30,083
I'll tell you this lousy
city isn't fit for a dog,

19
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:31,375
much less a man.

20
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:33,791
Never thought it'd be
so cold inside a dome.

21
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,541
Well I don't know where
you're from, mister,

22
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:38,333
but I doubt there's anywhere
fit to live these days.

23
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,041
Always helps to have a friend

24
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:46,791
when you're crossin'
the mountains.

25
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:49,583
Never know what
you might run into.

26
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:52,791
Like bears... or wolves.

27
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,333
[BARTENDER]
Wolves?

28
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:56,708
Now there's something I haven't
heard about in a long time.

29
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:59,708
Not since my grandpa was alive.

30
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:00,791
He always used to tell me

31
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,750
when the world finally
comes to an end,

32
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:05,375
Paradise will appear
on the Earth.

33
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:07,708
But the trouble
is that only wolves

34
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:09,500
would know where to find it.

35
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:13,083
Who knows. Maybe the world
is coming to an end right now.

36
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:14,208
[thunk]

37
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,250
Wolves are only
servants of Death!

38
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:19,750
Don't you believe all
that pagan garbage.

39
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,000
Relax, old man.

40
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:23,250
Wolves have been
extinct for 200 years.

41
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:25,166
It's just kids' fairy tales.

42
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,708
[QUENT]
The thing about fairy tales is

43
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:30,125
there's always
some truth in 'em.

44
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,625
What? What is it, Blue?

45
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:52,875
Did you see one?

46
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,166
[CHEN]
Hey, Tsume!

47
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:15,000
Where's the fire?

48
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:18,041
Can't we slow down a little?
There's nobody's following us.

49
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:19,333
I know...

50
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:21,208
Haven't we gotten
enough already?

51
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:24,125
I mean, there's
plenty to go around.

52
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:25,500
The provisions for the Nobles

53
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:27,875
are gonna be passing through
the checkpoint tomorrow.

54
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:29,041
[ALL]
Huh?

55
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:30,958
We're gonna hit 'em again?

56
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:34,708
[TSUME] Chen, Sedo, you're
in the advance squad.

57
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:36,458
Why doesn't that surprise me?

58
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:39,625
Yeah, but we messed it
up bad there last week.

59
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,916
Security's gonna be
even tighter now.

60
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,500
We lost two of us
today as it is.

61
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:47,291
[TSUME]
Ghel, you're on standby.

62
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:50,416
Anyone who isn't willing
to fight should get out now.

63
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,000
[REBELS whispering]

64
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:09,333
[TSUME]
What is it?

65
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:12,166
It's a dog, but I don't
think it's gonna make it.

66
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,208
[gasps]

67
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:18,833
[CHEN]
Maybe it's worth something.

68
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,375
[SEDO]
Maybe we can eat it.

69
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:23,000
[REBEL A] I've never seen a dog
this big. The suckers huge!

70
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:24,708
[TSUME]
That is not a dog.

71
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:25,666
[REBELS]
Huh?

72
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:26,833
[TSUME]
Pull it out.

73
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:31,833
Okay...

74
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:40,916
[yelps]

75
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:45,416
[whimpering]

76
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,375
How interesting.

77
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:31,708
That was quite a stunt.

78
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:35,291
[WOLF] I was protecting
myself. That's all.

79
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,583
[TSUME]
Don't be so quick to kill.

80
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:39,125
[WOLF]
What's wrong with killing?

81
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:42,041
[TSUME] I don't know what
mountain you came down from,

82
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:43,875
but you're in the city now.

83
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,291
There are rules.

84
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:46,708
[WOLF]
Rules?

85
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:49,083
Is running around this
city with a pack of idiots

86
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:51,291
one of the rules?

87
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:52,708
I'm only using 'em.

88
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:55,125
[WOLF] Your rules stink
like this city.

89
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:59,416
What's the point of living if it
means throwing away your pride?

90
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,416
You gotta a big mouth
for someone half dead.

91
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,833
[BOTH gasp]

92
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:17,916
[WOLVES barking]

Are you okay, Tsume?

96
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:51,666
Hey, you're bleeding...

97
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,083
Don't touch me!

98
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:57,458
[TSUME]
And stay outta my business.

99
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:05,958
I wanted to thank you.
You saved my life back there.

100
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,833
I always thought
maybe you didn't care

101
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:10,333
if one of your
friends got killed.

102
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:15,166
I guess I thought, maybe I'd
never be one of your friends.

103
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,958
[TSUME]
We're not friends.

104
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:22,291
It's just... I'm not
like you people.

105
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:37,500
I've never seen this expression
on her face before.

106
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:39,291
Has the solution been altered?

107
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:41,416
No. It's the same as always.

108
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,166
Do you think she's awakened?

109
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,625
[CHER] According to the data
we found, the first thing

110
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:48,583
Cheza's showed a response
to was blood, wasn't it?

111
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,833
[FEMALE SCIENTIST]
Wolf's blood, you mean.

112
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:54,083
[CHER] Yes... The smell
of wolf's blood.

113
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:56,375
[MALE SCIENTIST] But, what
evidence is there that...?

114
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:57,958
[CHER]
None.

115
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:00,208
Many things exist that can't be
explained by scientific proof

116
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:02,083
simply due to a
lack of evidence.

117
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:05,000
Cheza herself is the crowning
achievement of an alchemy

118
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:08,000
that can not be proved.

119
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:11,708
The Flower Maiden and the wolves
are being drawn to one another.

120
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:14,666
Like an ancient
scholar's fairy tale.

121
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:06,125
[siren wailing]

122
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:20,916
[HUBB]
Quent Yaiden.

123
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,333
So tell me, what brings
the sheriff of Kyrios

124
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:26,041
to our humble city?

125
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:28,375
That's some heavy artillery
you've got, there.

126
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:31,458
But I doubt you came all
this way for the hunting.

127
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:34,833
[QUENT]
What did you do with it?

128
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:37,500
Where's the animal I put down?

129
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:38,833
[HUBB]
Dead, apparently.

130
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:40,041
Huh?

131
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:41,666
[HUBB] The carcass will
be disposed of here.

132
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,416
That's impossible!

133
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,208
There's not a chance in
hell that thing is dead.

134
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,208
I have to see it
with my own eyes.

135
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:50,166
Don't you get it? It's a wolf!

136
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,666
You think it's a wolf?

137
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:55,875
[QUENT] It may look like a dog,
but it's not. It's a wolf!

138
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:58,083
You don't honestly believe
that we wiped those things

139
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,333
from the face of the
planet, do you, detective?

140
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:03,916
The last appearance of a
wolf was over 200 years ago.

141
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,791
Just, how do you propose
they survived all this time?

142
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:08,916
The mountains and forests
have been stripped bare.

143
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,166
There's nowhere on earth
they could live or hide.

144
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,833
They're all around us!

145
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:15,708
They've just put us all
under some kind of spell!

146
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:20,333
The wolves exist and we
have to destroy them all.

147
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,000
[HUBB]
I figured this sort of thing

148
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,333
might be under
your jurisdiction.

149
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:21,750
[CHER]
So it's alive?

150
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:25,333
Just barely. But it's
only a matter of time.

151
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:27,833
That sounds like the two of us.

152
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:29,500
We're not over yet.

153
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:31,750
All we have to do
is keep trying.

154
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,458
I'm not so sure.

155
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:37,541
What are you doing?

156
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:39,208
What department are you with?

157
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,458
[HIGE]
Oh, uh, sorry.

158
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,291
I was lookin' for
cleaning supplies.

159
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:45,708
I guess I must've got lost.

160
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:47,166
[HUBB]
The cleaning crew, huh?

161
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,666
Just go out that door.
Supplies are on the right.

162
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,541
[HIGE]
Oh, are they? Thanks.

163
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,875
So, do you think
it's really a wolf?

164
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:02,416
I don't know.

165
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,375
I've never seen
a real one before.

166
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:06,875
But if it is a wolf,

167
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,083
it may be what's causing this
sudden reaction in Cheza.

168
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:12,666
[HUBB]
Oh, please. Not Cheza again.

169
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,625
What's that mean?

170
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:17,083
It's because of her
you and I broke up.

171
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:20,541
Stop acting like an idiot, Hubb,
and bring this up to the lab.

172
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,416
I'll have someone do it later.

173
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,250
Dogs and I don't get
along all that well.

174
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:27,458
I'm kind of allergic to them.

175
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:28,833
[groans]

176
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:32,125
This is the reason you
and I would never work.

177
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:34,958
I dunno, maybe it is
just a matter of time.

178
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:01,708
I'm coming with you guys.
I wanna fight.

179
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,750
I can help you.
Just tell me what to do.

180
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:19,958
Man, you really screwed up.

181
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,083
I mean, I've seen one
of us get caught before,

182
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:26,708
but never this badly.

183
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:29,083
[WOLF] I can get out of here
whenever I feel like it.

184
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:31,500
Uh-huh. So then why
are you in there?

185
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,791
[WOLF] I just needed a place
to rest for a while. That's all.

186
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:36,250
[chuckles]

187
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:38,875
I'm Hige, it's
nice to meet 'cha.

188
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:41,208
[WOLF]
So, why are you here, anyway?

189
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:42,666
No reason.

190
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,750
It smelled like something
interesting was gonna happen

191
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:48,333
and I just followed
my nose, you know?

192
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:50,541
Besides, I got
nowhere else to go.

193
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,041
[WOLF]
That's not your true form.

194
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:53,625
Why do you hide yourself?

195
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:55,791
[HIGE] So I don't
end up where you are.

196
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,500
These people are
terrified of us.

197
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:59,458
So, you know, if
we look like them,

198
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:01,666
they pretty much leave us alone.

199
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,375
[WOLF]
You're living a lie

200
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:06,916
just so you can die a
miserable death in this city?

201
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,500
Gotta do what you can
to survive, right?

202
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:12,416
Keep looking like that,
you'll be back here in no time.

203
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,208
It draws too much attention.

204
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:16,625
[WOLF] Have you given up
your pride as a wolf?

205
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:17,666
[HIGE]
Hm?

206
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:21,166
You're a strange one, all right.

207
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:25,083
But having pride doesn't count
for much if you're dead, y'know?

208
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:32,666
[alarm blaring]

209
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:07,958
[gasps]

210
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:13,375
Tsume!

211
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:22,041
[screaming]

212
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:40,625
[DISPATCH RADIO]
All units,

213
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,500
we have a disturbance
at checkpoint 12.

214
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:45,125
One deceased male, late teens.

215
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:55,291
Sir! That big dog!
It disappeared!

216
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:56,333
[HUBB]
What?

217
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,750
[HUBB] It's gone. Do you
think someone stole it?

218
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:43,125
Could be. Or maybe it
escaped on it's own.

219
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:49,250
[HIGE] Your wounds.
Have they healed?

220
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:53,791
[WOLF] Yeah. After all,
it's a full moon tonight.

221
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:56,958
[HIGE] So, why'd you come to
this crummy town, anyway?

222
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:58,666
[WOLF]
I smelled something.

223
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:02,708
The scent of Lunar Flower.
It's here in this city.

224
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:04,583
[HIGE]
Yeah, I know.

225
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:05,875
My nose can tell

226
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:08,791
when a dog's takin' a dump
ten kilometers away.

227
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:11,250
Yeah? That must really stink.

228
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:12,333
[chuckles]

229
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:13,958
Sure does.

230
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:20,916
[WOLF]
So why did you escape with me?

231
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,041
Oh, I dunno. I just
felt like it, I guess.

232
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:27,458
Besides, you seem
kinda interesting.

233
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,416
So what's next?
Where're ya headed?

234
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,000
To Paradise.

235
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:36,791
There isn't any
moonlight in this place.

236
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,750
Paradise, huh?
That sounds like fun.

237
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:47,041
My name is... Kiba.

238
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:21,041
[BOY] I met the cutest girl by
that garbage dump in the alley.

239
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:23,041
She gave me food
and everything!

240
00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:26,291
She's so nice. Really nice.

241
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:29,250
Oh wait... you don't
know me yet, do ya?

242
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:31,500
Just watch the next
episode. You'll see.
