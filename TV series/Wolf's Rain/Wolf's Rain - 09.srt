[HUBB]
A rumor was going around

2
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:09,166
that there was a theft at
the House of Lord Orkham's

3
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,541
just a month ago.

4
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:13,333
Yet, apparently it was never
reported to the police.

5
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,041
[SNAKE CHARMER] What a silly
reason to come here.

6
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:20,750
The more important question
is why are you shaking?

7
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:23,000
Am I so scary, little boy?

8
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:25,875
[HUBB] No. Ya see,
I'm allergic to snakes.

9
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:27,208
[SNAKE CHARMER chuckles]

10
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:29,375
[SNAKE CHARMER] I've never
heard that one before.

11
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:36,541
Come on, you can talk
about work later, right?

12
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:37,916
Well, the truth is

13
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,875
I always embarrass myself
in situations like this.

14
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:42,708
Pretty sick of it myself.

15
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:45,875
Oh. That's the cutest
line I've ever heard.

16
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:48,041
But never the less,
it's not really customary

17
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:51,625
for a detective to go digging
around in a Noble's affairs.

18
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:53,125
What are you after?

19
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:55,166
I'm looking for someone.

20
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,333
[SNAKE CHARMER]
Your lover?

21
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:58,666
My ex-wife.

22
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,625
Is that so?

23
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,625
It's been said that the thieves
who got into the castle

24
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:18,416
were the last survivors
of a fallen Noble family.

25
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,166
The lord of the manor
has his pride, you know?

26
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,208
I think he wants to
catch them himself.

27
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:25,125
Is that why it wasn't reported?

28
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,000
Perhaps he wanted to keep
whatever was stolen a secret

29
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:31,958
from the police, ya know?

30
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,958
Thank you.

31
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,708
A glass of whatever'll
warm me up.

32
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:57,708
[BARTENDER]
Yes, sir.

33
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,000
I'd like a chilled
sherry, please.

34
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,041
[BARTENDER]
Yes, ma'am.

35
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:16,125
[BOTH]
Hit me again.

36
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:22,041
Looks like ya still got
a fair amount of tourists

37
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:23,458
around this place.

38
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:27,166
All the uninvited
ones, anyway.

39
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:33,333
So what do they
come here to see?

40
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:35,791
That old castle on
the mountaintop?

41
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,166
That place is nothing
but ruins now.

42
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,916
And besides, you can't
get anywhere near it.

43
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,041
Oh?

44
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:44,541
There're wolves up there.

45
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:46,208
[QUENT]
What?

46
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:48,041
[PATRONS laughing]

47
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:49,625
Give me another.

48
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:52,291
[BARTENDER] Don't you
think you've had enough?

49
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,666
I guess.

Cheza?

52
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:33,416
We have a friend, even here.

53
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:44,416
It is all right.

54
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,791
You do not know what
you are. You never did.

55
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,416
Is that not right?

56
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,500
There is some wolf
inside of you, too.

57
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:06,875
[CHEZA] You were alone your
whole life, were you not?

00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:20,750
[KIBA]
Cheza!

59
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,833
[RETRIEVAL LEADER]
No doubt about it, sir.

60
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:36,291
We've pinpointed
the target's location.

61
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,666
Good. Continue to
keep a trace on them.

62
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,166
Should we hit 'em
all at once, sir?

63
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,833
No, make sure the
town's surrounded first.

64
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:44,458
After you've cut off
all their escape routes,

65
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:47,000
I want you to move your men
in and capture the target.

66
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:48,500
Yes, sir!

67
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:49,833
What about the woman?

68
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:53,416
You can ignore her. At
this point she's useless.

69
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,833
This should be a
perfect place to hide.

70
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,583
Once we catch wind
of what they're up to,

71
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:09,708
we'll come right back.

72
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:11,458
Cheza, you stay here with Toboe.

73
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:12,791
Leave it to me!

Don't be too long, okay?!

75
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,041
[TOBOE]
I like this.

76
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:26,250
The idea of friends
waiting for other friends,

77
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:28,125
it's really a nice feeling.

78
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:31,208
If you know what I mean.

79
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:32,458
What is it?

00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,041
This one is stuffed.

81
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:41,208
And you?

00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:43,833
Um... Sure.

carryin' any weapons.

How do you explain
how I got these cuts?

90
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:21,041
They can't possibly be human.

91
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:25,333
They moved almost like
they were wild animals.

Well, now that you mention it,

that woman was saying
weird stuff like that.

00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:31,041
Something about wolves.

About wolves?

Rusu found you somewhere and
brought you home. Look at' cha.

102
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,000
You were nothin' but
a little pup back then.

I told him no again and again,
but he wouldn't listen.

104
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,166
And in the end, he just
stood there in the doorway

105
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,083
not saying a word,

with those big eyes of
his all full of tears.

Ah, damn it, if it's one
thing that kid got from me,

108
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,000
it was my stubbornness.

Well, partner, how many years
would you say it's been?

Anything in particular?

Hypothetically speaking,

125
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:28,333
if a member of the House
of Darcia came back,

126

where exactly do
you think he'd--?

Now that takes me back.

129

The family fell into ruin,
and this city died.

130

It's all their fault.

I doubt if they'll ever
come back here again.

For argument's sake, what if
they happened to come back

133
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:55,875
to get something that
was truly vital to them?

Something like...
like a Lunar Flower.

Well, the castle may be a mess,

but the Darcia family cemetery
at the foot of the mountain

is still intact.

00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:50,291
[GUARD C]
Would you give it a rest?

163
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:51,250
[beeping]

164
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:52,291
Yes, sir.

165
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:55,541
Ah!

166
00:13:58,416 --> 00:13:59,791
Hey.

167
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:02,291
You really spooked me back
there before, you know that?

168
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,416
Now I get to return the favor.

169
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,208
Roger that. We're
going back to base!

170
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:13,875
[whines]

171
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:24,333
[growling]

172
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:35,583
[thud]

173
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,416
Now listen to me, kid, I
know it's important for you

174
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,458
to feel like you're makin'
it on your own, but...

175
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:48,291
[HASU] Oh yeah? And what
would you know about it?

176
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:51,458
I know.

177
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:54,916
And so will you when you have
kids of your own some day.

178
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,083
Yeah, I bet I will.

179
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:59,541
Then, I'll just decide
to take off one day,

180
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,250
sayin' it's for the
good of the family

181
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:05,583
and when my kid tries to stop
me, I'm just gonna ignore him.

182
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,875
You're like that,
too, aren't you?

183
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,458
[HASU] If you're done with
your good deed for the day,

184
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,291
then just leave me alone.

185
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:14,625
I'm sick of being
lectured by people

186
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:16,375
with nothin' better to do.

187
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:23,916
[QUENT]
Be seeing you, kid.

188
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:30,000
[QUENT]
Sorry I bothered you.

189
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:02,458
Ah-ha!

190
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,000
What took you so long?

191
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:07,750
[TOBOE chuckles]

192
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,666
Hey, welcome back.

193
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,000
How did it go?

194
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:13,500
They've really got us
surrounded this time.

195
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:16,333
So we'll have to move at night.

196
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:17,958
There's a place that's
not too far from here

197
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:20,375
that the local humans
call the Forest of Death.

198
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:23,375
Forest of Death.
That doesn't sound good.

199
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:26,125
They say if you get lost
in it, you never come out.

200
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:27,708
Big deal.

201
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:30,333
With our noses that forest will
be a piece of cake, am I right?

202
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:32,041
Right.

203
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:33,458
How's it lookin'?

204
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:35,666
[TSUME] I found an escape
route that'll be perfect.

205
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,666
That settles it.
We'll be leaving tonight.

206
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,583
[TOBOE] All right! We can
finally get outta here!

207
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:03,208
The cemetery of
the House of Darcia.

208
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:10,958
Forest of Death.

209
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:17,500
[gasps]

210
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:27,291
Darcia.

211
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:45,583
We have the area
surrounded, sir.

212
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:47,416
Good, get ready
to storm that thing.

213
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,416
Kill everyone in sight
but the target.

214
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,583
Yes, sir.

215
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,083
They're not here!

216
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:07,916
But how? Where the
hell'd they go?

217
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,166
[GUARD D]
What? Roger.

218
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,125
The Commander says
they got away.

219
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,125
Who got away?

220
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:22,458
They're here! All forces
quickly converge-- Ah!

221
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:24,083
[GUARD E]
There they are! Shoot!

222
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,166
[whistles]

223
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:05,541
That's the boy.

224
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:07,291
No doubt about it!

225
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:15,416
[whimpers]

226
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:18,375
Oh Blue.

227
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:23,708
Blue, I... Hm?

228
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,583
What the hell
happened to you?

229
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:34,125
[howling]

230
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:45,250
I'll be back as soon as
I put an end to this.

231
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:58,000
Shouldn't they be here?

232
00:19:58,083 --> 00:19:58,791
They are here.

233
00:19:58,875 --> 00:19:59,916
Uh...

234
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,083
But where?

235
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,625
Sorry we're late.

236
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,375
Operation successful.

237
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,208
[HIGE chuckling]

238
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:17,708
[QUENT] You damn wolves!
You'll never fool me again!

239
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:33,791
Kiba.

240
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:37,250
He protected her.

241
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:03,375
[yelling]

242
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:10,125
[gunshots]

243
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,125
Blue.

244
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:45,041
[howling]

245
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:52,958
[howling]

246
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:22,375
[CHEZA] Forest of Death.
Another Apple. Grab the Gorilla.

247
00:23:22,458 --> 00:23:26,083
Trumpet Grass Tides.
Old Wise Owl.

248
00:23:26,166 --> 00:23:27,833
True or Not True?

249
00:23:27,916 --> 00:23:30,875
Man in a Mask. Wonder and Wait.
