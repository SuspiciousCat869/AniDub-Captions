1
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:28,958
So, how're your men holding up?

2
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:31,375
If there's anything I
can do to help out...

3
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:33,208
Our own medical staff
is more than enough

4
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:35,000
to handle the situation.

5
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,458
I can't believe that ten
of our men were injured

6
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:42,541
while we let them escape.

7
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:44,541
But they won't be able
to get away from us,

8
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:47,250
not from this aerial city.

9
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:50,166
[CHER] Commander, who do you
think those boys really are?

10
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,750
I would imagine they're some
of Lord Darcia's people.

11
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:56,083
To be honest, I'm not so sure.

12
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:02,000
That expression that the
Flower Maiden had on her face

13
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:04,666
when she was running
with those boys.

14
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,583
Cheza was smiling.

15
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:09,416
She was smiling as if
she were truly happy.

16
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,750
[COMMANDER] Crying, smiling,
it makes no difference.

17
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:15,000
Our mission is to
bring back that Flower

18
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,916
with detectable life signs.

19
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,166
And that's just what
we're gonna do.

20
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:35,916
[gasps]

21
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:41,916
Can't be. That's impossible.

22
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:57,708
[yelps]

23
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,041
She can tell?

24
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:06,041
Well sure, she's a
Flower Maiden, isn't she?

25
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:07,208
Yeah, but how?

26
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:09,208
She uses her antenna, how else?

27
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,958
She doesn't have any of them!

28
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:12,541
know ya can't see
'em or anything,

29
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:14,208
but I bet they're there.

30
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:19,208
I wonder if she's on edge.

31
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:21,916
I mean, around us. But why?

32
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,083
It's because you're all on
edge around her, that's why.

33
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:29,500
Who the hell
wouldn't be on edge?

34
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:32,166
She's not a human
and she's not a wolf.

35
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,791
Or even a Flower.

36
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:37,083
How are we ever supposed to
trust something like that?

37
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:40,000
And even more so
'cause a Noble created it.

38
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:44,875
[TSUME] Are we really
gonna to take her with us?

39
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:45,750
[KIBA]
Yeah.

40
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,125
[TSUME]
What for?

41
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:48,916
[TOBOE] I don't see
anything wrong with it.

42
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,916
It'd be mean to
just leave her here.

43
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,875
And besides, I think
it'd be kinda nice

44
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:55,333
to always have the smell
of Lunar Flowers around.

45
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:56,833
Don't you?

46
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:59,125
[TSUME] Isn't that exactly what
makes her a danger to us?

47
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:02,958
If she stinks up the place
while we're moving around,

48
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:05,416
it's as good as giving
away our location.

49
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,041
A human's sense of smell
isn't that sensitive.

50
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:10,541
But my eyes tell
me she's trouble.

51
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:13,333
What good is she to us anyway?

52
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:16,208
Cheza's more important
to us than anything else.

53
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:18,666
And if you're a wolf, Tsume,
you should know this.

54
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,333
Sorry, but I don't.

55
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:22,541
She's gonna get us to Paradise!

56
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:25,458
I am so sick of
hearing that word!

57

All of a sudden...
I'm feeling...

61
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,583
...really sleepy.

62
00:05:57,791 --> 00:06:00,416
Damn it, Toboe,
don't fall asleep!

63
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,208
[TOBOE]
Too late..

64
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:05,833
My body's already out cold.

65
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:07,125
What's happening?

66
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:09,750
I have no idea what's goin' on.

67
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:10,916
I just...

68
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:25,666

--[cat meows]
--[TOBOE] Huh?

00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:43,791
[gasps]

71
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:51,333
Cats always freak me out.

72
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:03,750
[TOBOE sniffing]

73
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:06,375
Is this where we were
supposed to hook up?

74
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:10,375
What the hell is that thing?

75
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,541
I thought that maybe
she might be cold.

76
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,833
[HIGE] What're you talking
about? She's a Flower.

77
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:19,875
Cold's got nothin'
to do with it.

78
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,791
But still, I-- What're those?

79
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:26,333
I figured the mountain paths
might be a little rough

80
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:27,666
on her delicate feet.

81
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,708
[TOBOE]
Hm. Even if she's a Flower?

82
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:35,416
Come on, let's go.

83
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:49,958
You slept the longest
out of everyone.

84
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:51,833
Did you have sweet dreams?

85
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:54,208
I... don't remember.

86
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:56,541
You were running while
you were sleeping.

87
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,750
It's no use. Those people
are covering every road

88
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,500
that leads off the mountain.

89
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:06,625
We're gonna have to find
another way outta here.

90
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:08,916
Next time, don't leave
it here with me.

91
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,500
I'm not gonna be responsible.

92
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,250
I tried to wake you up,
but you didn't even budge.

93
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:16,125
Besides you seemed pretty
happy wherever you were.

94
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:19,166
Oh, shut up. I was
tired, that's all.

95
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:29,250
Is it just me, or do you get
the feeling we're being watched?

96
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:30,250
Yeah.

97
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:31,916
You don't think
it's them, do ya?

98
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,750
With their stench, I can
smell 'em comin' a mile away.

99
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,833
I heard something
from the cats here.

100
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:39,083
They said there's a
ghost wandering around.

101
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:40,541
You say a ghost?

102

Yeah.

00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:49,333
Is that a ghost?

used some sort of sharp knife.

Very well.

111
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:18,208
I want all of you men to
split up into your squads

112
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:19,833

[SQUADRON]
Sir!

114

Human infiltration tactics?

115
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:28,000
Only because it seems
like a waste of time

116
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:30,458
to wait around for
radar readings.

might still be alive even today?

No, I haven't.

[CHER]
There's a very real possibility

121
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,041
that those boys we saw
aren't ordinary humans.

122
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,041
They could be wolves
who've learned to survive

123
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,666
by deceiving us.

124
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:55,791
Well, well.

was a thin line

and daydreamers,

you to be one of the latter.

some other things, too.

plan to do with that?

Now these are great.

Huh?

162
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:58,500
It's them!

163
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:01,166
I got a feeling we shouldn't
hang around here any longer.

164
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:18,541
Do ya think it's
safe to go with her?

165
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:21,375
If she's like Cheza, we
shouldn't have to worry.

166
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:47,375
[HANABITO]
I felt them within my body,

167
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:50,458
the terrible events
that occurred.

168
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:52,541
And those Hanabito

169
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:56,583
who were the unfortunate
and imperfect ones,

170
00:14:56,666 --> 00:15:01,791
had no choice but
to wither and die.

171
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:06,291
I was fortunate enough to
escape from the castle.

172
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:09,083
In the forest, at the
foot of the mountain,

173
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:14,291
I stayed in hiding
for a long, long time.

174
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:19,583
And before I knew it,
I was left all alone.

175
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:24,416
Even if you don't know
nothing about yourself, I do.

176
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,250
I know you very well, indeed.

177
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:28,791
All this time.

178
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:33,041
This one has been asleep and
waiting, waiting just for him.

179
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:37,250
The wolf seeks out the Flower,

180
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:40,125
and the Flower
seeks out the wolf.

181
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:45,625
And yet, no matter how you feel,
you must not go with them.

182
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:47,083
But why?

183
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:50,083
[HANABITO] It will only
lead to destruction.

184
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:51,083
Are you crazy?!

185
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:53,333
[HANABITO]
I'm not talking to you!

186
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:56,833
Come on, Cheza, let's go.

187
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:04,291
[HANABITO] The faintest
scent a Flower can offer

188
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:06,708
is all I have left now.

189
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:11,000
And soon, it, too,
will fade completely.

190
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:13,208
[CHEZA]
What should this one do, then?

191
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,583
[HANABITO]
You have the ability

192
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:19,000
to sustain the life
of a Hanabito.

193
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:20,708
Stay here.

194
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:22,291
Cheza, don't listen to her!

195
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,333
[HANABITO]
Wolf.

196
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:27,416
Just what precisely
do you hope to achieve

197
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,250
by taking this
precious girl with you?

198
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:32,291
[CHEZA]
To get to Paradise.

199
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:36,041
We are going to Paradise.

200
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:45,125
Shh! Be quiet!

201
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,458
[HIGE] I smelled her
back at the castle.

202
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:53,541
I know I've seen her before,
but I don't know where.

203
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:55,541
What now?

204
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:56,708
Let's go.

205
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:59,416
Cheza, let's go.

206
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:18,583
You're the boys I saw.

207
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:21,458
Who are you?
What's going on here?

208
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,375
[CHER]
Cheza.

209
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:54,208
I found them! I found
the boys who took Cheza!

210
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:55,750
[beeping]

211
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,666
Why is it--? What's going on?

212
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,708
[COMMANDER]
What happened?

213
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:13,583
Does this ridiculous
radar pick up everything,

214
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:15,625
even flowers and trees?

215
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:17,083
Search the town!

216
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:30,916
She is crying.

217
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:34,375
[CHEZA]
She will wither away.

218
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,041
Do you mean the old lady?

219
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:42,500
Kiba, can this one
stay with you?

220
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:47,125
Is it all right that
this one stays with you?

221
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:51,500
Cheza, you have
to stay with us.

222
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:53,916
Hige?

223
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:56,416
[chuckles]

224
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,000
Sure, why not?

225
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:01,291
When you're on a journey,
the more the merrier.

226
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:02,500
Toboe?

227
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:04,708
[chuckling]

228
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:07,291
Tsume?

229
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:12,375
[sighs]

230
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,125
Fine, you can tag along.

231
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:17,291
If it gets us to where we're
goin', I can put up with ya.

232
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:04,416
[gasps]

233
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:09,375
Dear, it's all right.

234
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,291
My having met you was enough.

235
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:19,500
[CHEZA]
This one is going.

236
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,500
With them.

237
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:29,458
With the rest of them.

238
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:31,500
I will pray for you.

239
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:36,041
I will pray for your safety.

240
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:38,416
Ever since this we came here,

241
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,083
this one has heard voices.

242
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:44,375
[HANABITO]
The Flowers are singing.

243
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:47,875
They're always singing.

244
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:53,041
But people never seem to notice.

245
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,958
[CHEZA]
This one's sorry...

246
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:27,250
[TSUME] Did either of you
tell her about Paradise?

247
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:28,458
I didn't.

248
00:23:17,416 --> 00:23:21,416
[CHER] It's said that a Flower's
life is brief. I can relate.

249
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,416
I'm getting to that age
where working all night

250
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,958
takes a toll on your body.

251
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:27,791
There are some nights
when I feel like having

252
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:30,083
a quiet drink alone, all right?
