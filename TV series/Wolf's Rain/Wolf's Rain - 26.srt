00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,166
The wolves didn't kill him!

You've got to believe me.

165
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:10,916
Please, Pops!

Oh, Blue.

[softly howls]

171
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:45,625
[ALCHEMIST A] At last.
Our Paradise is opening!

172
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:49,375
[ALCHEMIST B] Is this the world
brought forth by the Moonstone?

173
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:53,333
[CHEZA]
Goodbye... Kiba.

174
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:54,666
[KIBA]
Cheza.

175
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:59,291
[CHEZA]
This one... is going to wither.

176
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,166
[KIBA]
Cheza!

177
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,416
Hold on!

00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:10,250
[KIBA howls]

[howls]

180
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:32,458
[JAGUARA]
We Nobles have become lost.

181
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:35,791
Disconnected from the
world of our birth,

182
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:39,625
we quietly wait
for a lonely death.

183
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:46,458
But you and I can stop time.
and hold this moment forever.

184
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:55,500
[DARCIA] But in this stale
and stagnant moment of time,

185
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,416
one can neither
long for the past,

186
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:02,041
nor change what is yet to come.

187
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:04,583
[KIBA]
A fabricated Paradise...

188
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:08,166
Such place holds no future.

189
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,375
[JAGUARA]
But what of your grandfather?

190
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:15,583
He too searched for a Paradise
meant only for the Nobles.

191
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:18,458
[DARCIA] That man
thought only of himself.

192
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:22,041
He cared nothing for
those he left behind.

193
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:26,583
That's why he vanished
and our clan was cursed.

194
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:30,166
[KIBA] A Paradise created
from a cursed world

195
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,750
--is meaningless.
--[DARICA] is meaningless.

196
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,208
[JAGUARA]
Liar.

197
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:36,333
You've been deceiving
yourself from the beginning,

198
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:40,000
never once giving your
heart over to the truth.

199
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:44,875
Even now, when what you long
for is right before your eyes.

200
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:48,583
[DARCIA]
It is meaningless.

201
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:50,375
[JAGUARA]
Because of Hamona?

202
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:54,458
[JAGUARA chuckles]
You are not so ignorant.

203
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:58,291
You've always known who
it was for, haven't you?

204
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:01,041
That eye, your blood.

They have longed for Paradise.

--[DARCIA] You're wrong.
--[KIBA] You're wrong.

--This world is not Paradise.

Who are you!
What trickery is this?!

It can't be!

What are you?
I have to know.

Now I understand.

It is not merely that
we search for Paradise.

283

But that Paradise,
is calling for us.

284

[CHER] All things
must come to an end.

285
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:25,500
I suppose even my supple
skin and youthful looks

286
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:27,916
will simply fade away one day.

287
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,166
Life can be so cruel.

00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,250
But it's not over yet.
