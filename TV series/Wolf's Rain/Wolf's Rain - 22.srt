Then, the Flower Maiden is here?

164
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:45,625
[WOMAN]
The time has finally come...

165
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:02,916
[HIGE] Man... It's like
a junk yard for bones.

166
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:07,083
[TSUME] I've got a
bad feelin' about this...

167
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:10,083
That may be, but we
still have to pass through it.

168
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:13,458
I kinda figured you'd
say that. Hm?

169
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:15,625
Toboe?
What happened to your arm?

170
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,583
[TOBOE]
Huh?

171
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,958
Oh, I uh... must've
bumped into something.

172
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:22,208
It's just a scratch.

173
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:24,750
Why don't we
rest for a while.

174
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:27,000
Don't baby me,
I said I'm fine!

175
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:29,291
Come on! Daylight's wastin'!

176
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:32,375
If he's got that much
energy, he must be okay.

177
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,500
But there's no telling what
the smell of fresh blood

178
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:35,583
will attract.

179
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:36,791
Look on the bright side.

180
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,333
If something does
decide to show up,

181
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:39,708
we can always eat it.

182
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,000
All the better
if that something

183
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:43,000
has a lot of red meat on it.

184
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:05,541
[TOBOE panting]

185
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:35,791
[HIGE]
Hey, runt!

186
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,958
You okay over there?

187
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:40,375
Thanks for askin',
I'm just fine.

188
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:51,833

What the hell...?

191
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,416
Toboe, no!

192
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:18,791
[HIGE]
Get out of the water!

193
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:53,625
[KIBA yells]

194
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:54,416
Bastard!

195
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,500
Kiba!

[TOBOE yelling]

00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:38,541
[KIBA]
Toboe, don't do it!

198
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:48,958
Are you all right?

199
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,833
Yeah, where's Toboe?!

200
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:45,208
[TSUME]
That damn kid went crazy!

201
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:48,458
[HIGE] This sucks.
This really sucks.

202
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:51,125
Why is he taking
so long to come back up?

203
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:53,291
Come on, Toboe.

204
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:55,250
Toboe!

205
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:11,833
[TOBOE growling]

206
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:32,583
[HIGE]
Toboe!

207
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:34,083
[HIGE]
Are you okay?!

208
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:35,500
[TSUME]
I can't believe it!

209
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,500
[HIGE]
What got into you?

210
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,458
Something happened...

211
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:50,416
And then... I just... I just...

212
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,916
I dunno, it was like
something deep inside of me

213
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,833
just snapped all of a sudden.

214
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:59,666
[SEA MONSTER]
You must be joking...

215
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:05,083
Not once have I ever been
defeated on this island.

216
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:11,083
I have been here, protecting
it since long, long ago.

217
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:14,625
Even when I was
the only one left.

218
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:21,333
In this world, it's either
kill or be killed.

219
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:23,375
But understand this...

220
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:27,875
I will not die a victim...

221
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,625
I am going...

222
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:33,833
...to save you.

223
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:48,791
[stomach growls]

224
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:49,833
Hige...

225
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:56,041
He's your kill,
so you eat first.

226
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:20,125
[JAGUARA] I tell you now
the words of Red Moon.

227
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:23,000
From the Great Spirit
was born the wolf

228
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:25,833
and man became its messenger.

229
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:28,375
The beast lives
his life in silence,

230
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:31,500
abiding where the blessing
of the blood of the gods

231
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:34,708
is bestowed upon him.

232
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:36,625
The white Flower,

233
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:39,875
after winning the favor
of the lord of the night,

234
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:41,708
will share her scent.

235
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:56,208
Preordained and
eternal in countenance,

236
00:20:56,291 --> 00:21:00,083
her form is of a
lily-white supple maiden.

237
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:02,375
She distills and condenses

238
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:03,875
all of time

239
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:06,875
until it becomes
a precious, frozen mass.

240
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:37,500
Only then will appear...

241
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:39,458
...the wretched beast.

242
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:18,166
[BLUE]
It's a "girls only" road trip.

243
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:20,708
Which, of course, invites
every idiot in a pair of pants

244
00:23:20,791 --> 00:23:22,916
to make a pass at you.
[sighs]

245
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,166
Aren't there any decent
guys around here?

246
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,375
Maybe I'll make the
first move for a change.

247
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:29,666
See what happens when
the tables are turned.
