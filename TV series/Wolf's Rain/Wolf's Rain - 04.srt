1
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:33,875
Ah, man. I sure am hungry.

2
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:37,000
Yeah, you could say that again.

3
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:39,750
How long has it been
since we ate anything?

4
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:41,500
I don't know.

5
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:44,166
I guess it's been
about three days or so.

6
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,541
[TOBOE] We've gone that
long without eating?

7
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,041
[HIGE]
Yep. Not a bite.

8
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:51,833
How much longer before
we get any food?

9
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:55,208
I have no idea. Another
three days, I guess.

10
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:57,666
Will you two quit your
whining, already?

11
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,625
It's only been
three stupid days.

12
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:01,416
[TOBOE] Yeah, but if
we hadn't left the city,

13
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,541
we would have something
to eat right now.

14
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:07,583
[KIBA] We can last a lot longer
if we bask in the moonlight.

15
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:10,416
I traveled a full month
once when I did that.

16
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,916
Did you say a month?

17
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,416
It should stop
snowing anytime now.

18
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,541
Once it does, and night draws
closer, the moon will be out.

19
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:21,416
Well, if worse comes to worse,
we can always eat each other.

20
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,916
[HIGE, TOBOE gasp]

21
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,166
We could start with the runt,
since he's gotten so weak.

22
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,958
And of course there's always
little porky over there.

23
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,708
Wait a second! How come
Kiba isn't on the menu?

24
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:33,875
Because the guy's totally
full of crap that's why.

25
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:38,458
[TOBOE]
Come on, cut it out!

26
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:39,958
You don't mean it!

27
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:42,250
You're just sayin' stuff like
that 'cause you're hungry.

28
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:44,625
Ah!

29
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:57,625
[TOBOE]
I wonder where it came from.

30
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:00,041
I mean it's all
by itself out here.

31
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,541
You' gonna eat that?

32
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:05,500
Yeah, aren't you gonna?

33
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:14,916
You know what?
This tastes pretty good.

34
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,500
It's only a little bit
tougher than hamburger.

35
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:19,708
Hey! Come on, Tsume, have some.

36
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:22,166
We still have a long
way we have to go.

37
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:26,166
[TSUME]
Go? Go where, exactly?

38
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,625
To that Paradise place?

39
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:31,708
Off in the direction
you smell the Flower?

40
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:33,625
Tsume.

41
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:36,458
Come on, Kiba, tell us,
what's Paradise really like?

42
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:38,416
It's an amazing place.

43
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:42,208
The flowers are always in bloom
and there's food everywhere!

44
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:45,000
Oh, and there are beautiful
babes all over the place.

45
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,208
You mean it?

46
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:50,375
Of course there are.
Heh. I hope so, anyway.

47
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:51,875
You don't know.

48
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:55,750
[TSUME] Paradise is just a
totally unfounded fairy tale.

49
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:56,916
And if it isn't,

50
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,833
then it's probably
just some idiot's dream.

51
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:00,875
So then why the hell'd
you come with us?

52
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:03,208
[TOBOE] We'll never know
unless we look for it.

53
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:06,875
How far are you gonna let
this guy string you along?

54
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:09,541
How far are you gonna follow
this guy in pursuit of a place

55
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:11,875
that doesn't even
exist to begin with?

56
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:16,416
That's it. I can't put up
with you losers anymore.

57
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,833
[TOBOE]
Tsume!

58
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:19,791
Hey, where do you think
you're goin' all by yourself?

59
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:22,375
To look for Hell I guess.

60
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:23,708
[KIBA]
Suit yourself.

61
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:26,958
[TOBOE]
Kiba.

62
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,416
But remember,

63
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:32,041
that set of rules you have
doesn't apply way out here.

64
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:34,708
It really pisses me off
when a smug kid like you

65
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:36,541
has that "know it all"
look on his face

66
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,500
and he's actually clueless.

67
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:44,416
[TSUME]
Hmph.

68
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,958
Tsume!

69
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:48,875
Come on, don't leave now. We've
finally made some friends!

70
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:52,041
[TSUME] Play with your buddies
all you want. I'm outta here.

71
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:58,708
If ya ask me, the only one who's
acting like a kid around here

72
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,125
is him.

73
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:04,416
Don't say that. I like
Tsume, he's really nice.

74
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:08,791
Just wait here.
I'm gonna go get him.

75
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:16,666
[TOBOE]
Hey! Wait for me, Tsume!

76
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:19,833
What're you so mad about, huh?

77
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:21,708
Come on, come back
and join us, okay?

78
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:22,958
Shut the hell up!

79
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:25,125
You know it's dangerous
to move around alone.

80
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:27,791
It doesn't matter, does
it? We're always alone.

81
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:29,291
But wait I--

82
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,750
Stop bothering me!

83
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,916
And don't follow me.

84
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:56,291
[TOBOE]
Tsume!

85
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:59,333
Tsume!

86
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:03,250
Tsume!

87
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:04,291
[clink]

88
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:18,833
[TOBOE]
Tsume!

89
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:22,458
Hey! Tsume!

90
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:45,625
[howling]

91
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:51,125
[TOBOE]
Tsume!

92
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:54,000
Tsume!

93
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:57,833
Hey! Tsume!

94
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,875
[explosion]

95
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:39,625
[gasps]

96
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:54,833
[HUBB] He came this
close to shooting the guy

97
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:55,791
right in front of me.

98
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,833
[CHER]
Keep your voice down.

99
00:08:57,916 --> 00:09:00,166
[HUBB]
That man is unbelievable.

100
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,041
He's convinced that
those boys are wolves

101
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,666
and nothing on this earth
is gonna change his mind.

102
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,000
Listen, Hubb.

103
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:08,541
There's something I need
to you to do for me.

104
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:13,250
[CHER]
If it's not too much trouble,

105
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:16,083
could you water the plants in
my apartment while I'm gone?

106
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:17,583
Gone? What do you mean?

107
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:19,958
[CHER] I'm... taking
a little vacation.

108
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,208
I'll be gone for a while.

109
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:23,541
Vacation? Wait a minute,
what's going on?

110
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,666
I thought you said you
were feeling better.

111
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,583
That's why I'm
taking a vacation.

112
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:30,083
I don't understand,
what about... Uh...

113
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:33,291
You know. That thing that you've
sacrificed your whole life for?

114
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:34,583
Including us?

115
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,583
It doesn't really matter
whether I'm here or not.

116
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:38,541
Nothing's ever going to change.

117
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:41,166
Certainly not the lab,
or even the world.

118
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,666
What're you saying?

119
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,291
[CHER]
All this work I've been doing,

120
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,666
I mean, seriously,
what's the point?

121
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:50,250
I feel like everything
around me is an illusion.

122
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:54,208
I just... don't know
what's real anymore, Hubb.

123
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:58,541
So much for light conversation.

124
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,791
[HUBB] You know wolves
may actually exist.

125
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:01,875
But, Hubb.

126
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:04,500
Listen to me, that dog
we saw was not--

127
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,000
Stop it, Hubb.

128
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:08,291
Just hear me out. I think there
may be more of them, Cher.

129
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:09,958
[CHER]
Okay, give it a rest,

130
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:12,208
I don't wanna think
about it right now.

131
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:13,125
I'm going.

132
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:15,916
You're going now? But...

133
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,250
[CHER]
Thanks for dinner.

134
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,500
[HUBB]
Uh.

135
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,583
Oh, Cher, wai-wait a minute!

136
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:55,958
[TSUME groaning]

137
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:56,916
Are you okay?

138
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,333
Stay away!

139
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,041
[humming]

140
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,250
We're gonna have to jump.

141
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:06,291
But...

142
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,583
What the heck is that thing?

143
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,000
How should I know?

144
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:35,666
[TSUME grunts]

145
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,750
Tsume.

146
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:41,208
Dammit.

147
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:44,041
The stench of this place
is startin' to make me sick.

148
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,291
You know, I was thinkin'.

149
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:28,416
We should go ahead
and ditch that guy.

150
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,833
I mean, it's not like he has to
tag along with us, or anything.

151
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:33,875
It was happenstance
that threw us together,

152
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:36,333
and they just ended up
with us, that's all.

153
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:38,125
The same goes for you.

154
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:40,083
I don't know. That Tsume
guy's been giving me

155
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:42,791
a real dangerous vibe
from the start.

156
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:45,583
[KIBA] He's just difference
from us, that's all.

157
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:47,750
He always had
someone else to blame.

158
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:50,625
It's pretty darn lucky,
if you ask me.

159
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:52,625
Give him a break,
he'll come around.

160
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:57,875
Okay, so what the hell
is up with you anyway?

161
00:12:57,958 --> 00:12:59,208
I mean, you're always talkin'

162
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:02,291
like you got an answer
for just about everything.

163
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:04,916
What happened to you
before all this?

164
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,375
Nothin' much.

165
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:09,083
Nothin' much at all.

166
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:16,458
[TOBOE, TSUME yelp]

167
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:18,750
[screams]

168
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:28,791
Hey!

169
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:34,333
Hey, Kiba, do you smell that?

170
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,166
[HIGE]
What's that?

171
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:00,791
Hm. Maybe there used to be
a military base around here.

172
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:08,083
[HIGE]
Hey, Kiba! Wait!

173
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:11,875
[sighs] What a drag.

174
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:13,083
Whatever.

175
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:21,708
[groaning]

176
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:30,250
Stop that! Don't ever touch me.

177
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,000
What's it doing?

178
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:39,333
It's not after us. Looks
like we gave it the slip.

179
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:47,583
[TOBOE]
You're covered in scars.

180
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:52,416
That one. There on your chest.

181
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,541
Man, it's really cool!

182
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:03,125
[TOBOE] I wonder what
happened to Kiba and Hige.

183
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:05,916
I bet they're pretty
worried about us by now.

184
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:09,583
[TSUME]
I don't trust anyone.

185
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:14,833
And because of that
no one has to trust me.

186
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:18,166
That way, it keeps
things nice and simple.

187
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:21,625
I don't care. I still
like you anyway, Tsume.

188
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:32,500
[clanging]

189
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,416
Ah, damn!

190
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,833
Forget about it, Tsume!
You'll get yourself killed!

191
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:46,208
Well at least then you'll
finally have something to eat.

192
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:47,916
Don't be stupid!

193
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,875
I'll act as a decoy
and distract him

194
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:51,791
so you can get away!

195
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:52,916
Don't do it!

196
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:56,208
You can trust me, it's okay.

197
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:44,125
[howling]

198
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,958
[HIGE]
Tsume!

199
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:10,291
This way!

200
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:52,500
Water the plants?
She doesn't have any.

201
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:53,541
Huh?

202
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:56,708
[HIGE]
Hey, you okay?

203
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:58,375
[KIBA]
It's only a scratch.

204
00:20:58,458 --> 00:20:59,666
Yeah, right.

205
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:02,250
Ever since I met you guys,
nothing but trouble.

206
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:03,208
I knew it.

207
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:04,583
Well I wasn't sure,

208
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:07,625
but I had a feeling that you
guys would come for us.

209
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:09,583
Well, don't get
too used to it, kid.

210
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:11,583
[TSUME]
I didn't ask for help.

211
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:15,916
Why would you do that,
risk your life for me?

212
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,750
And don't try telling me that
it's because we're friends.

213
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,375
That's easy.

214
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:24,083
It was just instinct.

215
00:23:17,708 --> 00:23:20,791
[HIGE] It's really a drag being
hungry all the time, ya know?

216
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:22,833
I mean, it's a
crappy way to live.

217
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:26,250
A man needs adventure
and romance in his life.

218
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:29,666
And this one man...
who lives for love.
