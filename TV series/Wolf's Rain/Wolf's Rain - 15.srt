Who knows.

161
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:21,333
I wonder if I'll ever
see Leara again?

162
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:23,958
Hey, you think it'd be okay
if I went to visit her?

163
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:26,625
[TSUME] You saw that look
on her face, didn't you?

164
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:30,083
[TOBOE] She was just... a
little surprised, that's all.

165
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:33,250
[TSUME] You can't be serious!
She was pissing in her pants!

166
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:34,375
[TOBOE]
She was not!

167
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:36,250
That girl was reekin' of it.

168
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:39,083
[TOBOE] Why do you have
to lie about everything?!

169
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:42,791
Why can't you just be honest
with yourself for once!

170
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:44,250
Fine, whatever!

171
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:46,166
If you wanna go, then go.

172
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,625
It's not like I care
what happens to ya.

173
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:51,291
[TOBOE]
So why did you save me, then?

174
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:53,625
If you really don't care then
you should've just left me

175
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,125
or pretended not
to recognize me.

176
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:58,666
I mean, I'm not your
friend or anything.

177
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,750
[TSUME] You're right.
You're not my friend.

178
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:06,166
Yeah, I forgot, you're only
friends with humans.

179
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,000
It's easier that way, isn't it,

180
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:11,541
'cause no human is ever
gonna be as strong as you.

181
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,458
They'll do whatever
you tell them to.

182
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:15,750
You don't know what
you're talking about!

183
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:18,458
You have no idea what it takes
to survive in this city,

184
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:21,125
how dangerous it is. Nothing!

185
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:26,416
Go on. Let's see how
well you do on your own.

186
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,000
Beat it!

187
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:38,250
Being alone doesn't
bother you?

188
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:40,500
Hey, I'm sorry.

189
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:41,833
[gasps]

190
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:44,458
I'm sorry I ever got mixed
up with a kid like you.

191
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:45,541
[TOBOE]
Uh.

192
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:54,000
I'm sick of friends.
Who needs 'em.

193
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,166

[yelps]

198
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,833
You sold me out?

199
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:27,416
They caught us when we tried
to sneak onto the train.

200
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:31,208
We couldn't just let you
get away scot-free.

201
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:33,916
[TSUME]
Heh. You damn humans.

202
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,208
Huh?

203
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:36,791
[OFFICERS panting]

00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:55,291
You're pretty good.

[TSUME whimpering]

208
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:38,250
[HIGE]
What a crap heap.

209
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:39,541
Why the hell'd you
bring us here?

210
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:40,208
Tsume!

211
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,291
[HIGE]
Wha...?

212
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,125
I could smell the blood
from your wound.

213
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:44,500
[TSUME]
What?

214
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,458
[KIBA] I smelled it all
the way here from the town.

215
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:48,750
[TSUME] And you're gonna
nurse me back to health?

216
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,583
Well, I don't need your help.

217
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:52,750
[TOBOE]
Tsume... Look, I...

218
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:54,291
Um.

219
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:55,708
We're leaving the city.

220
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:58,000
I really think you
should come with us.

221
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:01,458
[TSUME] And just where is this
merry band of yours going?

222
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:02,875
[KIBA]
To Paradise.

223
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:04,875
Heh. Y' kiddin' me.

224
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:07,708
You're goin' with them because
you believe in that crap?

225
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:09,541
Oh, I don't know, but...

226
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,958
if we stay here we'll have to
spend the rest of our lives

227
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:13,958
in hiding, or worse!

228
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:17,666
We just can't live with the
humans anymore and survive.

229
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:24,291
Look, I hate to interrupt, but a
nasty stink is headed this way.

230
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:26,250
[TSUME]
We're surrounded.

231
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:27,416
Let me ask you.

232
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,541
Why did you guys
come to this city?

233
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:33,375
It was because of the
flower scent, wasn't it?

234
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,583
Well, it's gone now.

235
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:38,208
There's no reason to stay.

236
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:41,875
The flower has
nothing to do with it.

237
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:44,125
I'm here because I belong.

238
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:47,541
[KIBA] I can see that.
This city is a dump.

239
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:49,916
I still have a score
to settle with you.

240
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,500
We don't have time for this!

241
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:54,583
The last time we met you said
something about how your pride

242
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:56,500
wouldn't allow you
to pass as a human.

243
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:59,750
Well, you look pretty human
now. Where'd your pride go?

244
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:03,000
Nowhere. Nothing has changed.

245
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,916
Do you have the slightest idea

246
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,333
of what leaving
the city would mean?

247
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:08,625
[KIBA]
Yeah.

248
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:10,791
You'll just die.

249
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:15,416
Possibly. Everyone's gonna die.
It's a natural part of life.

250
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,625
But if your life has no
purpose you're dead already.

Go on. Hurry up.

You're really not
coming with us?

you stopping for?

00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:31,666
This way!

00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:49,250
[HIGE]
Jump already!

262
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:51,166
I was getting ready
to, all right?!

263
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:51,791
Move it!

00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:07,416
Tsume, what are you
waiting for, come on, jump!

268
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,708
[KIBA]
Are you scared?

269
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:15,583
Yeah, you wish.

270
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:22,333
[TSUME]
Screw this stupid journey.

271
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:24,791
Paradise can kiss my ass!

272
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:29,583
I'm just fed up with
this stinking town.

273
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:32,250
It was time to move on anyway.

274
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:47,000
[KIBA] I saw them once
before, when I was little.

275
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:49,250
I was still just a cub.

276
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:55,208
In the region where I was born
they had blossomed all over.

277
00:20:55,291 --> 00:21:00,416
White flowers that only
bloomed under a full moon.

278
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,916
They were Lunar Flowers.

279
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,750
They were all burned to ashes.

280
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:10,791
[KIBA]
A fire raged across our land.

281
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:14,875
It burned all the flowers
in an instant, and all...

282
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:20,041
all of my friends whose escape
route was cut off were killed.

283
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:24,416
I was the only
one who survived.

284
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:28,458
Why me? Why just me?

285
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:32,125
I don't have a pack anymore.

286
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:35,333
The only place for me now...

287
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:37,083
is Paradise.

288
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:19,166
[TOBOE] There're all kinds
of things in this world.

289
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:21,833
And you can't really do
much about most if it.

290
00:23:21,916 --> 00:23:24,708
But sometimes just waiting
to see what happens

291
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:27,875
is what makes the journey
fun, don't ya think?

292
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:31,083
I wonder whatever
happened to that girl?
