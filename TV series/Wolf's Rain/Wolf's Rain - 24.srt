#23, huh?

00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:41,333
[SOLDIER E] Doesn't look like
any others are with him.

4
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,250
Why did they spare me?

5
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:06,708
I don't get it...

Don't stop, keep walking.

Damn it, let me go!

[MAN 1]
That bastard!

12
00:01:27,791 --> 00:01:29,458
I paid him a fortune for this!

13
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:37,291
[CHER]
We lucked out.

14
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:39,041
Looks like ours
are the real thing.

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,583
[BLUE] The city looks
a lot different up here

16
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:48,500
than it does down below.

17
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:49,750
[CHER]
Yeah...

18
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:53,583
It's so clean and orderly,
almost antiseptic.

19
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:55,958
But not in a good way.

20
00:01:56,041 --> 00:02:00,125
It's likely to become more
dangerous the further we go in.

21
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:01,250
[BLUE]
Maybe...

22
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:02,791
But it doesn't matter.

23
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:04,208
Cheza's in there.

24
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,875
[TSUME] We've been to all kinds
of places before, but...

25
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:06,458
[KIBA]
But what?

26
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:09,041
[TSUME] I've never felt such a
sense of danger as I do here.

27
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,375
Every hair on my body is on end.

28
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:14,291
This stupid place is freakin'
me out and I don't like it.

29
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:15,541
Well, there's something new.

30
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:16,708
How's that?

31
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:18,916
I never expected
to hear you whine so much.

32
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,125
It's a normal reaction
under the circumstances.

33
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:24,541
Well, why don't you
just go back, then?

34
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:26,416
And leave all
the excitement to you?

35
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,833
Not a chance, pal.

[TOBOE]
Oh man... I'm goin' in circles!

37
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:36,458
Geez... there's no scent
at all in this place.

38
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:39,750
Cleanliness is one thing,
but this is ridiculous!

39
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:43,000
I wonder if Hige
headed back to meet up

40
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,333
with the others already?

[HIGE groaning]

42
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:58,333
Damn it!

43
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,833
What the hell is
going on around here?

44

[HIGE gasps

45
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:29,958
[CHER] I thought we could
get to Jaguara's keep

46
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,250
if we headed for
the center of the city,

47
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:35,083
but all these streets
are so convoluted.

48
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:37,833
Besides the fact that
everything looks the same,

49
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:39,583
it's as if someone's
deliberately trying

50
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:41,166
to make us lost.

51
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,083
There's something
unnerving about this place.

52
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:46,125
It doesn't seem human at all.

53
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:48,916
[CHER]
Ma'am?

54
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Could you help us?

55
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,125
Certainly.

56
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:52,458
Thanks.

57
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm wondering if this is where
we can catch a bus

58
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,291
that will take us to the keep.

59
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:56,208
No, dear.

60
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,583
Do you know where, then?

61
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:01,166
There aren't any
buses like that, dear.

[CHER gasps]

63
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,166
Well, what about
one that goes near it?

64
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,666
I think you're confused, dear.

65
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,458
There's no keep in this city.

66
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:20,833
I... uh...

67
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:23,583
[GIRLS chattering, laughing]

68
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:29,166
What's the deal
with the people here?

69
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,958
It's like they've all
been brainwashed.

70
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:34,166
[BLACK CAT]
Pretty close.

71
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,916
The people in this city
are all zombies.

72
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,416
What do you mean?

73
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,625
[BLACK CAT] They live their
lives in a comfortable daze.

74
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:43,208
They don't think,
they don't feel,

75
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:45,333
and they don't question.

76
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:47,208
So what do you
want to know?

77
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:48,666
Well, a couple of things,

78
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,416
like what's the truth
hiding underneath

79
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,833
the façade of this place?

80
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:55,416
[BLACK CAT]
Come with me.

81
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,333
[BLUE]
Where to?

82
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,833
[CHER]
Blue, what's the matter?

83
00:06:57,916 --> 00:06:59,916
[BLUE] It looks like we might
finally get some answers!

84
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,125
[CHER]
Hey, wait!

85
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,041
A bookstore? Oh, I see.

86
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:09,916
They might have a map
of the city here.

87
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:15,458
Excuse me, Sir.

88
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:17,416
We were hoping you'd
have a city map.

89
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,125
Map, huh?

90
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,666
You must be outsiders.

91
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:26,000
[OLD MAN]
Now don't be alarmed.

92
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:29,250
I was an outsider myself once.

93
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:30,583
Oh...

94
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:33,208
Of course, I was
a lot younger then...

95
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:36,333
[BLACK CAT meows]

96
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:38,916
[OLD MAN] That's right,
boy, so were you.

97
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:43,916
[OLD MAN] Don't get many
requests for maps these days.

98
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,208
The people who live here
don't need 'em.

99
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:47,625
[CHER]
Why is that?

100
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:48,916
[OLD MAN] Because they're
not interested in anything

101
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,083
that doesn't have to do
with their own lives.

102
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:59,583
All right,
we're currently in this area.

103
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:02,666
And over here is where
you'll find Jaguara's keep.

104
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,333
At the heart of the city.

105
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,208
What's this?

106
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:12,583
[OLD MAN] They say that's
where the Crucible lies.

107
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:14,833
It generates the city's energy.

108
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:15,833
Crucible?

109
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:17,208
[OLD MAN]
The Moonlight Crucible.

110
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:18,541
Moonlight Crucible?

111
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:19,958
I've never heard
of such a thing.

112
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:20,875
What is it?

113
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:21,750
[OLD MAN]
Beats me...

114
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,666
No one really talks about it.

115
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,916
How can everyone be
so completely ignorant

116
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,041
about what's happening
in their own city?

117
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,791
Doesn't anybody
even bother to think

118
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,875
about what's happening
around them?

119
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:34,958
[OLD MAN] Thinking only causes
more trouble than it's worth.

120
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:37,791
Why should we care about
things that don't concern us?

121
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,750
[CHER] Do you honestly
believe that this life

122
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,250
will go on forever?

123
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,625
[OLD MAN] Why would I have any
reason to think otherwise?

124
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:44,875
[CHER]
If you've been outside,

125
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,750
then that should
be reason enough!

126
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:49,041
Didn't you see what's
happening to the world?

127
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:50,666
[OLD MAN]
Oh, yes...

128
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,666
It was like a bad dream.

129
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,291
[CHER]
It's not a dream. It's real!

130
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,916
Trust me, once you've
lived here for a while,

131
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,208
you won't care
about anything, either.

132
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:01,875
Just like the rest of us.

133
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:06,791
Fine. I'll just take this.

134
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:09,583
Suit yourself, but I think
you're wasting your money.

135
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,250
[CHER]
Let's go.

136
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:14,375
[OLD MAN] The sooner you
get used to living here,

137
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,708
the happier you'll be.

138
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:17,875
[BLACK CAT]
He may say that,

139
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,083
but he's not used
to this place, either.

140
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:22,125
Not completely, anyway.

141
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:24,458
[BLACK CAT purrs]

142
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:26,708
You don't know
how lucky you are.

143
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:57,166
Even from way up here,
I can't tell where anything is.

144

[TOBOE gasps]

145
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:09,833

I'm so glad.

147
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:20,916

[HIGE yelling]

150
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:12,000
I smell something.

151
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,416
[KIBA]
Tsume!

152
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:22,208
[TSUME]
Kiba! Kiba, can you hear me?!

153
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:29,250
At least we're both
heading for the same place.

154
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:32,583
One thing's for sure...
I smell flowers.

155
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,083
[CHER] I'm starting to think it
really was a waste of money.

156
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:53,333
The roads leading to the keep

157
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:55,791
aren't marked
at all on this thing.

158
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:57,208
Maybe it means
that the only ones

159
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,958
who can go in or out are
the Nobles and those soldiers.

00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,666
I wonder if she's all right...

163
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,833
You don't think they're
hurting her, do you?

164
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:11,958
I know you're worried for her.

165
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:15,000
You wolves have such a
strong affection for Cheza...

166
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:17,333
Why do you think that is?

167
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:19,208
It's because of Paradise.

168
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:21,291
She's going to guide us there.

169
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,916
At least, that's what
Hige and the others believe.

170
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,791
Wolves will open
the way to Paradise...

171
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:29,208
So the story was true.

172
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,791
[BLUE]
Whenever I'm around Cheza...

173
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:36,125
I feel like I really
am a wolf, y'know?

174
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:38,000
Back when I was
living in Kyrios,

175
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:40,708
it never even crossed
my mind that I was wolf.

176
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:42,041
Not once.

177
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:43,583
[CHER]
Kyrios?

178
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:45,916
[BLUE]
It was this nice little town.

179
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,041
We were so happy there...

180
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:49,458
Do you want to go back?

181
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:53,000
No. I wish I could,

182
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:55,666
but it was destroyed
in a fire a long time ago.

183
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:00,375
I see...

184
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:03,041
I guess I don't have
anywhere to go back to, either.

185
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:09,000
I'll go with you.
We'll both go to Paradise.

186
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:35,625
Great, another dead end.

187
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:38,750
What in the world is wrong
with this stupid city?

188
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:42,166
[SOLDIER A] 'Scuse me, Miss.
Are you lost?

189
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,541
[CHER]
No.

190
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:46,041
[SOLDIER C]
What town are you ladies from?

191
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,708
[CHER]
What do you mean?

192
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:48,916
[SOLDIER C]
You don't have to hide it.

193
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,208
If you both have the
proper identification,

194
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:53,916
we don't really care.

195
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,166
And as long as you're not
from Freeze City, that is.

196
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,375
We're from a little
town called Kyrios.

197
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:01,166
Did you say Kyrios?

198
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,916
It's strange that
you'd come from there...

199
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,125
Only because I could've
sworn that Kyrios

200
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:10,583
was wiped from the
planet many years ago.

201
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,125
[SOLDIER B]
Yeah...

202
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:16,041
It was the first town we
attacked after I joined up.

203
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,541
What do you mean?

204
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:20,208
We burned every inch of
that place to the ground.

205
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:21,208
[BOTH gasp]

206
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:23,375
But why on earth
would you do that?

207
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:25,791
[SOLDIER C] A pack of
wolves was hiding there.

208
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:29,125
And it was our mission
to kill 'em all.

209
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:31,791
Man, that was
a beautiful fire...

210
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:44,375
[SOLDIER C yells]

211
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,041
Hey, she's a wolf!

212
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,083
What?

213
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,083
[SOLDIER B]
Damn it!

214
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:13,458
[SOLDIER A]
Relax, will ya?

215
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:14,958
She may have escaped for now,

216
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:17,125
but she'll never get out
of this city alive.

217
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:43,625
Wolves didn't
do it after all, Pops...

218
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:45,041
It wasn't them.

219
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:55,541
[HIGE groans]

220
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:57,625
Hige? Is that you?

221
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:01,875
Hige!

[HIGE]
Blue...

223
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,333
[BLUE] What in the world
happened to you?

224
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,041
Did someone hurt you, Hige?

225
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:10,416
You made it outta
that place in one piece.

226
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,833
I'm glad.

227
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:13,166
[BLUE]
But where are the others?

228
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:16,625
[HIGE]
I don't know. We got split up.

229
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,833
[BLUE]
Oh...

230
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:22,125
I always believed that you and I
would see each other again.

231
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:24,125
But I never thought it
would be in the back alley

232
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:26,166
of this awful place.

233
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:29,958
The only thing I could ask for
now would be to find Pops.

234
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:34,333
Hige...
I could tell him so much!

235
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:35,958
That it was the soldiers
from this city

236
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:38,250
who attacked and
burned our village.

237
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:41,208
They were the ones
who killed my family.

238
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:44,041
The wolves didn't have
anything to do with it.

239
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:46,833
It wasn't them.
It was never them.

240
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:53,500
[HIGE]
Hey, Blue...

241
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:56,208
How about you and I...
get out of this place.

242
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:57,541
[BLUE]
Huh?

243
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:59,333
[HIGE] We can't stay in
a city like this forever.

244
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:02,666
[BLUE] But the others
are still alive, right?

245
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,166
And what about Cheza?

246
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,875
I don't care!

247
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,416
Come on!

248
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,250
[BLUE]
Wait!

249
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:09,375
What's the matter with you?!

250
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:13,333
Hige, what's happened?!

251
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:20,458
They're watching me!

252
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:23,000
They're watching
me again, I know it!

253
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,458
Always...

254
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,416
They've always been watching!

255
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,625
You're starting
to scare me, Hige...

256
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:31,375
[BLUE]
Hige!

257
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,250
We have to get out of here!

258
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,833
The scent is getting stronger!

259
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:54,083

idea which way to go...

That's it! I know where I am!

265
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,416
I can finally go back down!

266
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:49,166
Faster now! And even faster!

Hige... What are we doing?!

268

away from here, fast!

Run away? To where?!

It doesn't matter where!

We never should have come
to this stupid city

What about Cheza?
And everyone else?

Are you really going to
abandon them all like this?
