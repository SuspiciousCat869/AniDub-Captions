They say nobody's ever gone in

It's the Forest of

That's the reason the humans
can't follow us in here.

Well, we don't have to rely
on compasses or whatever,

but shouldn't there at
least be some animals?

You know, like a
rabbit or a fox?

Rabbit, huh? In other

I bet you're hungry, right?

00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,541
Cheza does not eat bugs.

00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:08,375
Well then, what
should we feed her?

Now that you mention it,
I've never seen her eat.

She drank some
water that one time.

This one drinks and basks.

here in this forest, right?

[OWL] You never find

If the searcher were to find

The answer lies
within the darkness.

The answer lies
within confined spaces.

Only those who bravely
enter will be rewarded.

That a riddle?

Birdbrain wants us
to go in the cave.

221
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,666
So does that mean
there's water inside?

You only know the slightest
fraction about Cheza.

Tell me, do you believe

I've seen them.
I've seen wolves.

They were running together
by Cheza's side.

I'm sure of it now.

They were the same wolves
who turned up in the city.

The same ones who first
appeared when Cheza awakened.

320
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:14,333
[TOBOE]
I've had plenty!

321
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:15,291
[HIGE]
Aw, come on!

322
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:16,875
[TSUME]
Hige, leave him alone.

323
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:55,500
[DARCIA] The life of
a Flower is very brief.

324
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:56,916
[CHER]
Huh?

325
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,625
And Lunar Flowers
are no exception.

326
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:07,458
Moonlight will give her
strength to survive for now.

327
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:08,875
However,

328
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:13,333
after basking in the full moon
only a few more times,

329
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:16,750
Cheza's life will
come to an end.

330
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:19,375
[KIBA]
No one really knows

331
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:21,833
what the future has
in store for them.

332
00:23:21,916 --> 00:23:23,541
If they can't avoid it,

333
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:26,833
then why do people always
wanna know what it is?

334
00:23:26,916 --> 00:23:30,458
On the night of the full moon,
the path will be revealed.
