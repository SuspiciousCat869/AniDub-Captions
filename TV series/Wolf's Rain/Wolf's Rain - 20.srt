00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:31,750

Kiba.

you, I can't see.

00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:45,958

9
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:47,125
[KIBA]
Uh.

10
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:50,291
[OWL] Who are you?
Where are you?

11
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:54,583
I don't know. Who!

12
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:34,208
[IYEK]
Beyond those rocks

13
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:36,458
is a land called the
"Desert's Bones."

14
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:38,625
[TSUME]
The "Desert's Bones"?

15
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:40,791
[IYEK] If your friend
really did go in there,

16
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:43,375
looking for him
won't do any good.

17
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:47,458
Why don't you all stay
here and live with us?

18
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:49,291
I'm afraid we can't do that.

19
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:53,500
Y'see our friend is the one who
was looking for Paradise.

20
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:56,250
See ya 'round. Let's go.

21
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:02,250
I'm not going.

22
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,583
I want...

23
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:08,083
I wanna stay here!

24
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:14,375
You're gonna stay here, huh?

25
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:17,541
So, does that mean you don't
want to be with us anymore?

26
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:18,916
[TOBOE] 
Yeah.

27
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:26,333
There's something
about this place,

28
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:28,333
how Iyek and his people live,

29
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,416
that's Paradise to me.

30
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:33,875
Are you sure?

31
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:38,916
Toboe, Is this what you want?

32
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:42,833
Well, if that's really
what you've decided,

33
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:44,500
then it's okay by me, kid.

34
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:45,416
[HIGE] 
Hey!

35
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,083
[TSUME] 
Take care of yourself.

36
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:33,000
[TSUME] 
Since the day I met him,

37
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,958
that kid's wanted
to be with humans.

38
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:38,041
[HIGE] 
Tsume?

39
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:41,541
The runt's always had
a soft spot for 'em.

40
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:44,791
I guess that was pretty obvious.

41
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:48,750
[TSUME] Didn't you say you'd
given up on Paradise, too?

42
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:54,708
[TSUME] Don't feel like you
have to tag along for my sake.

43
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:58,333
You'd keep goin', even if
you had to do it alone?

44
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:04,166
[TSUME]
I want to see it for myself.

45
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,708
If wolves really do
cause the world to end,

46
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:11,208
then I wanna be there
when it happens.

47
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:12,791
Besides...

48
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:15,000
There's no way
I'm givin' up now,

49
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:18,833
not after spending time
with that pigheaded jerk.

50
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:22,125
So, I'm gonna look for him.

51
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:26,666
[HIGE] 
Hey, Tsume.

52
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,041
When did you start
talking like that?

53
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:31,125
You sound like him.

54
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:52,583
[MEW] 
Kiba? What's wrong?

55
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:55,666
[KIBA] 
I can't remember...

56
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,625
I've been hearing all these
different voices... But,

57
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:03,333
I can't remember
who they belong to.

58
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:05,500
I feel like I should know them,

59
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:08,250
but I can't see their faces.

60
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:12,041
Your memory fades,
little by little.

61
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:14,958
And then, you get used to it.

62
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:23,583
[OWL] Yes, little by little,
and little by little, still,

63
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:26,458
then little by little...

64
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:29,750
[MEW]
Don't worry, Kiba. I'm with you.

65
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:31,625
I'll always be with you.

66
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:32,958
[KIBA] 
Sure.

67
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:39,125
[OWL] Where are you?
Who are you?

68
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:42,000
Whether alive, or
whether you're dead,

69
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:46,250
there is nothing.
Nothing matters...

00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:52,208

buried beneath the sand.

[GRANNY] That's my good boy.
Are you ready to eat?

75
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:17,000
[GRANNY] Now, now,
calm down. Stop that!

I can't breath...

Are you sure?

00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,000
[TOBOE]
Hm?

00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:44,833

Oh, it's you.

[HORSE] About not going
to Paradise, I mean.

81
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:52,583
I'm sure. I don't really
have what it takes.

82
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:57,541
[HORSE laughs] Does anyone
ever have what it takes?

83

It's no wonder they all
think I'm a coward.

Not that it matters any.

[TOBOE] I'm sure Kiba
will be all right.

86
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:12,333
And it's not like I have to
worry about Tsume or Hige...

87
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:16,458
I mean, all I ever did
was hold them back.

88

They don't need that.

If I'm here, I won't
get in their way.

[TOBOE] It's coming from
where Tusme and Hige went.

97
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:55,250
Something is definitely wrong.

98
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:57,083
I think it might be them.

99
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,958
You mean the people who
attacked the dogs?

100
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:00,666

And attacked us, too.

The way they're comin' 

103
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:10,333
it's almost like they can track
our moves before we make 'em.

104
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:14,125

00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,666
[TOBOE, HIGE sigh]

163
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,666
I suppose you think
that's funny, huh?!

164
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,125
You scared us half to death!

165
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,375
Where've you been?

166
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:17,291
[KIBA] Someplace peaceful.
It was almost like Paradise.

167
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:20,250
But... It wasn't, right?

168
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:24,458
[KIBA] 
No. They kicked me out.

169
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:25,791
[ALL gasp]

170
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:27,500
Do not worry.

171
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:29,958
Your friend has returned to you.

172
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:31,666
[TSUME, HIGE, TOBOE sigh]

173
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:45,458
[TSUME] We should leave once
Kiba's back on his feet.

174
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:55,000
[HIGE]
What do you wanna do, runt?

175
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,583
[TOBOE]
Mm...

176
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:58,791
[TSUME] No matter how
hard you try to hide,

177
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:02,625
at some point you'll
have to fight.

178
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:05,500
Like it or not,
that's just the way it is.

179
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:08,750
I know. I know that.

180
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:24,458
[TSUME] 
You okay now?

181
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:27,958
[KIBA] 
Yeah. Guess I overslept.

182
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:31,250
I feel like I've been dreaming
for a really long time.

183
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:34,833
A strange and wonderful dream.

184
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:39,125
[ELDER] What your spirit beheld
was the Garden of Eternity.

185
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,291
[KIBA] 
Garden of Eternity?

186
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:44,250
[ELDER] You experienced
joy and tranquility

187
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,958
unlike any you've
known before, yes?

188
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:48,666
[KIBA] 
Yeah.

189
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,958
That is enough to
satisfy most people.

190
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:55,750
They embrace the illusion
and never look back.

191
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:58,583
But for you, that bliss
was not enough...

192
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:01,041
Or you wouldn't have returned.

193
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:05,500
[KIBA] Yes. There's somewhere
else I need to go.

194
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:10,000
Tell me. Why are you
searching for Paradise?

195
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:15,083
I have to, to survive.

196
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:18,625
I see.

197
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:26,000
[TSUME] So what happened to
you in that "garden" place?

198
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:27,500
[KIBA] 
Nothing.

199
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:30,666
Except, I met a nice girl.

200
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:34,416
[HIGE] 
You? Met a girl?! No way!

201
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,833
I should'a guessed.

202
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:37,666
No wonder you seem less uptight.

203
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,500
Wait. I don't get it...

204
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,541
And you won't for a few years.

205
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:44,041
[HIGE] Oh, man, Kiba
has all the luck...

206
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:45,875
[TOBOE]
But why can't I get it now?

207
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,375
When I was there,

208
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:50,208
the whole time it felt like
I was forgetting something.

209
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:51,708
Y'mean Cheza?

210
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:54,583
[KIBA]
Not just her. I mean you guys.

211
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:56,416
Huh?

212
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,625
I... thought your were dead.

213
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:01,416
You've gotta be kidding?!

214
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,791
Do you have any idea how
hard we busted our butts

215
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,500
tryin' to find you?!

216
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:08,333
[KIBA] Oh, ya did?
Sorry, I didn't know.

217
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:12,416
That brain of yours is never
gonna change, is it?

218
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:12,958
[HIGE laughs]

219
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:18,666
[ALL laughing]

220
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:25,458
Let's go.

221
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:29,625
[TOBOE]
I...

222
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:32,791
I...

223
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:35,500
I'm not gonna whine anymore.

224
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:39,416
And I won't run away.

225
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,958
[HIGE]
Wanna bet?

226
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:45,791
No way.

227
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:50,791
You ready? The kid sure is.

228
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,250
Yeah.

229
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:57,750
[IYEK]
Is Paradise far from here?

230
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:59,166
[KIBA] 
I don't know.

231
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:02,000
But there's no doubt in my
mind we're gonna find it.

232
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:03,875
[TOBOE] 
Do you think it's okay,

233
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:05,833
that we're trying to get there?

234
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:10,833
Take comfort in knowing
that the spirits are with you.

235
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:20,208
[KIBA] 
See ya.

236
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:21,250
[IYEK] 
Sure.

237
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:21,958
[TSUME] 
Let's go.

238
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,041
[HIGE] 
Later.

239
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:25,750
[TOBOE]
Well, guess this is goodbye.

240
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:28,625
[HORSE] You've got what it
takes to get to Paradise,

241
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:30,083
and then some.

242
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:34,291
Thanks a lot.

243
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:36,750
[HORSE laughs]

244
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:39,000
[TOBOE laughs]

245
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,041
[TOBOE] 
Iyek?

246
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:44,375
There's something I
need you to do for me.

247
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:45,833
He's got my scent on him,

248
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:48,583
so he shouldn't be
too hard to find.

249
00:19:57,875 --> 00:19:59,333
[stomach growling]

250
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:01,000
[QUENT] 
Ah, shut up.

251
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:05,166
No matter where I am,
it's the same damn snow.

252
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:09,541
Oh well. Death'll
be here soon enough.

253
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:14,666
When he comes for me,
I'll see Ruus again.

254
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,250
[QUENT] 
Who are you?

255
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:44,000
You chugged all of my
restorative potion.

256
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:46,416
[QUENT]
To me, it was the water of life.

257
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,000
Ah. I'm back from the grave.

258
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,708
[IYEK] I was asked as
a favor to rescue you.

259
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:54,583
To rescue me?

260
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:58,000
Yeah. Asked by a wolf.

261
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:03,416
Yeah right, pal. Not likely.

262
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:07,375
[IYEK] Why? Don't you
believe in wolves?

263
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:10,583
[QUENT]
Oh, I believe in 'em all right.

264
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:13,583
I believe they're
servants of the devil.

265
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,458
[IYEK] 
Here's some food.

266
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:21,291
I'll keep my promise
to help you,

267
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:24,041
regardless of what
kind of man you are.

268
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:26,750
Why in the hell

269
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:30,541
would they want to show
me pity at this point?

270
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:39,333
[QUENT] 
Gimme a freakin' break.

271
00:23:17,625 --> 00:23:18,875
[TSUME]
Why are all these idiots

272
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:21,125
going soft over
a bunch of women?

273
00:23:21,208 --> 00:23:23,166
We men have our own world.

274
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:26,291
A world of blood and
grease and gunpowder,

275
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:28,708
that reeks of sweat!

276
00:23:28,791 --> 00:23:31,625
On second thought, I'll take
the one with the women.
