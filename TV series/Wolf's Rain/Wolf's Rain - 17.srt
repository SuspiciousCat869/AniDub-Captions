1
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:44,750
[HIGE]
I've got to admit,

2
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:46,541
the reason I decided
to stay in this city

3
00:01:46,625 --> 00:01:49,208
was 'cause I caught
wind of something.

4
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:51,583
[HIGE]
I'd never smelled it before,

5
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:52,833
but I knew what it was.

6
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:55,291
The scent of Lunar Flowers.

7
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,541
[sniffing]

8
00:01:59,916 --> 00:02:01,083
[HIGE]
To be honest,

9
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:03,041
I don't really have that
much to complain about.

10
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:04,666
I can always find
somethin' to eat,

11
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,125
as long as I'm not too picky.

12
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,375
And even when it's freezin',

13
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:09,208
which is pretty much
all the time,

14
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:10,333
I can handle it.

15
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:12,125
The only thing that kinda sucks

16
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:14,916
is the total lack of
girls around here.

17
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,541
But on that one particular
day, I felt it, all right.

18
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:21,666
That dangerous but amazing
scent was calling me,

19
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,166
I just couldn't
leave it alone.

20
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:33,041
[BABY cooing]

21
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:10,583
Man, you really screwed up.

22
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:13,875
I mean,

23
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:17,000
I have seen one of us get caught
before but never this badly.

24
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:19,583
[KIBA] I can get out of here
whenever I feel like it.

25
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,708
Uh, huh. So then
why are you in there?

26
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:25,166
[KIBA] I just needed a place
to rest for a while. That's all.

27
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:28,916
[laughs] I'm Hige,
it's nice to meet 'cha.

28
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,708
[KIBA]
That's not your true form.

29
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:32,166
Why do you hide yourself?

30
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,250
[HIGE] So I don't end up
where you are.

31
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:37,041
These people are terrified
of us. So, you know,

32
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:39,708
If we look like them, they
pretty much leave us alone.

33
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:41,375
[KIBA]
You're living a lie

34
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:45,083
just so you can die a miserable
death in this city?

35
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:47,541
Gotta do what you can
to survive, right?

36
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:50,500
Keep lookin' like that, you'll
be back here in no time.

37
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:52,333
It draws too much attention.

38
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:54,750
[KIBA] Have you given up
your pride as a wolf?

39
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,708
[HIGE]
Hm?

40
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:59,041
You're a strange
one, all right.

41
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:01,958
But having pride doesn't count
for much if you're dead,

42
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,625
y'know?

43
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,166
[HIGE]
Strange ain't the half of it.

44
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,958
The guy's totally clueless

45
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,458
but he still has confidence
coming' out of his ears.

46
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:14,458
Kiba puts his neck on the line
without a second thought.

47
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,708
I guess it's my own
fault for hangin' out

48
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:19,958
with someone like that,
but what can ya do?

49
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:22,916
At any rate, we finally met her.

50
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Cheza, the Flower Maiden.

51
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:35,458
[DARCIA] There is nothing
to fear. You are awake, now,

52
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,041
at last.

53
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,833
[DARCIA] We can finally
set out on our journey.

54
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:50,291
[CHEZA coughs]

55
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:56,500
[HIGE]
This way.

56
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:00,750
[HIGE]
Uh!

57
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,041
[DARCIA]
Wolves?

58
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:09,375
You have my gratitude,
for it was you who woke her.

59
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:11,333
[KIBA]
What? Who the hell are you?!

60
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:14,750
[DARCIA]
The Flower Maiden is mine.

61
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:17,875
The Maiden?
Is that... Cheza?!

62
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:33,833
[DARCIA] We'll meet in Paradise.
If we meet again, that is.

63
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:39,875
[KIBA gasps]

64
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:46,250
[HIGE]
The scent of flowers was gone.

65
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,500
So we set out in
search of Paradise.

66
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:51,291
That runt, Toboe joined
us along with Tsume,

67
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:55,541
whose bark's as bad as his bite,
though it's mostly just a front.

68
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:58,000
Anyway, we're all
in this together!

69
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:01,708
Go on, give us your best
shot, we can take it!

70
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:06,083
Oh, man. I sure am hungry.

71
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:08,916
Yeah, you could say that again.

72
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,750
[TOBOE] How long it's been
since we ate anything?

73
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:15,291
I don't know, I guess it's
been about three days or so.

74
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,500
[TSUME] Will you two quit
your whining, already?

75
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:19,541
It's only been
three stupid days.

76
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:21,416
[TOBOE] Yeah, but if we
hadn't left the city

77
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,333
we would have something
to eat right now.

78
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,000
[TSUME]
Well, worse comes to worse,

79
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:26,333
we can always eat each other.

80
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:27,833
[HIGE, TOBOE]
Huh?!

81
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:30,000
We could start with the runt,
since he's gotten so weak,

82
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:32,500
and of course there's always
little porky over there.

83
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:33,750
[HIGE]
Eh.

84
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:35,833
Wait a second, how come
Kiba isn't on the menu?

85
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:39,208
Because the guy's totally
full of crap, that's why.

86
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:48,583
[DARCIA]
We're getting close.

87
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:51,083
Can you sense it?

88
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:54,083
That castle is where
you were born.

89
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,875
[HIGE] It wasn't until
after a whole mess

90
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:02,375
of other stuff happened
that we met Cheza again.

91
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:04,208
Uh.

92
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,875
She's there.

93
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:10,666
Hold it, it's nothing to do
with us, stay out of it!

94
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,208
I can feel it

95
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:13,833
Feel what?

96
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:18,416
I'm not sure.
But it's so familiar.

97
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,208
C'mon. Don't you guys
feel anything at all?!

98
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:23,375
[TSUME]
Kiba!

99
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:24,416
Can you?

100
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,666
That guy is hopeless.

101
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:35,250
That scent...

102
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:04,041
[ALL sigh]

103
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:05,125
It's her.

104
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:06,250
It's really her.

105
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:08,250
My heart just skipped a beat.

106
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,708
Who is that?

107
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:17,833
[CHEZA]
This way! This way!

108
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:21,125
That's Cheza, all right.
That's the Flower Maiden.

109
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:24,625
She's a flower and a maiden?
That's pretty weird.

110
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:26,041
[HIGE]
The way I heard it,

111
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:28,083
some Nobles with too much time
on their hands made her

112
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:31,208
from a Lunar Flower
in a lab somewhere.

113
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:33,291
Well, either way
you look at it,

114
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:37,083
she's really not my type
at all. It's such a bummer.

115
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:53,458
[CHEZA] This one has
been waiting for you.

116
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:56,208
This one was born
here in this place,

117
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:58,291
for that reason.

118
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:11,208
[CHEZA]
Everybody! This one's home!

119
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:20,125
[CHEZA] Oh, my. There
is no one here anymore.

120
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:24,708
They all... withered and died.

121
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:34,000
This one is the
only one left.

122
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:43,583
[KIBA]
Tell us. Who are you?

123
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:48,625
[HANABITO] The Hanabito is
what they used to call us.

124
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,875
This one could tell
that from your scent.

125
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,583
But, you are not like this one?

126
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:57,250
[HANABITO] That is true.
You are not like my kind.

127
00:09:57,333 --> 00:10:01,041
You, my dear are a
perfect creation.

128
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:03,625
The wolf seeks out the flower,

129
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:06,250
and the flower
seeks out the wolf.

130
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:09,583
And yet, no matter
how you feel,

131
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:11,458
you must not go with them.

132
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:13,166
[CHEZA]
But, why?

133
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:17,041
[HANABITO] It will only
lead to destruction.

134
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:21,125
Kiba, can this one
stay with you?

135
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:25,125
Is it all right that
this one stays with you?

136
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:30,041
Cheza, you have
to stay with us.

137
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:32,416
Hige?

138
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:36,083
[laughs] Sure, why not?

139
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:39,291
When you're on a journey,
the more the merrier.

140
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:40,500
[CHEZA]
Toboe?

141
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:42,583
[TOBOE laughs]

142
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:45,750
Tsume?

143
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:50,416
[exhales]

144
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,250
Fine, you can tag along.

145
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:55,583
If it gets us to where we're
goin', I can put up with ya.

146
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:02,875
[HIGE] When Cheza was
with the four of us,

147
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:05,041
she looked really happy.

148
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:07,583
We all had a soft spot for her.

149
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:10,666
And it was obvious that
she liked us, too.

150
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:14,708
I bet you're hungry, right?

151
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:17,916
Cheza does not eat bugs.

152
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,375
Well then, what
should we feed her?

153
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:23,166
What is?

154
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,166
This one is stuffed!

155
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,375
And you?

156
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,916
Um. Sure.

157
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:43,541
C'mon, Tsume. Have
Cheza pet you, too.

158
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,791
It feels unbelievable!

159
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:49,416
[HIGE]
Ah, she smells so good!

160
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,750
[TSUME growls]

161
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:54,333
[KIBA gasps]

162
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:55,833
[QUENT growls]

163
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:00,000
[KIBA grunts]

164
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:01,458
Kiba!

165
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:07,458
[CHEZA]
Wait. We'll all go... together.

166
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:16,458
This one can be...
useful, too.

167
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:23,500
Cheza!

168
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:24,875
[TSUME]
Damn it!

169
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,958
[HIGE] But out of all of us,
Kiba was the special one.

170
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:40,458
There's somethin' between
him and Cheza that's,

171
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:42,083
how can I put it?

172
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:45,125
Well, it's different from what
the rest of us have with her.

173
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:47,958
We could all see how
connected they were.

174
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:51,000
But even so, when we
wolves were with Cheza,

175
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:53,333
all of us were happy.

176
00:12:57,208 --> 00:13:00,041
[HIGE]
And then... it happened!

177
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:04,250
[HIGE] Our first full moon
since being with Cheza.

178
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:07,125
Our hearts were pounding like
they were ready to burst!

179
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:08,833
So this is it.

180
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:12,291
Yeah, right about now, I feel
like I could do almost anything!

181
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,666
I mean we've all seen
a full moon before,

182
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,500
but 'cause Cheza's with us, it's
seems different, doesn't it?

183
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:22,625
Uh! Oh man, I just wanna
howl my head off!

184
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:25,291
Somethin's about to happen.

185
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,791
[KIBA gasps]

186
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:25,625
It's the path to Paradise.

187
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,875
Is that really what it is?

188
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:31,458
Amazing! It's amazing!

189
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:13,375
The wolves.
It's been a long time.

190
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:15,916
[TSUME]
That stench... He's a Noble?

191
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,041
What are you doin' here?

192
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,583
[DARCIA]
Was your little dream pleasant?

193
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:22,750
The one where you were
going to Paradise?

194
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,416
What?!

195
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,333
The time has not yet
come for that.

196
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,791
[DARCIA]
Return to me, Cheza.

197
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:32,125
[CHEZA gasping]

198
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:34,541
Get out of our way!

199
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,125
It is futile.

200
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,000
Toboe!

201
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:53,791
[CHEZA gasping]

202
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:03,291
Ah, the blood of the wolves.
How magnificent.

203
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:08,791
[CHEZA gasps]

204
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:19,708
[CHEZA whimpers]

205
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:25,875
Kiba.

206
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:04,666
[CHEZA]
That is enough.

207
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:18,458
[KIBA grunting]

208
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,125
[KIBA]
Don't go!

209
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:27,708
[KIBA]
D-Don't...

210
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:33,833
[CHEZA]
It is all right.

211
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:37,666
[KIBA]
Don't go, Cheza. We're wolves.

212
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,958
We're not afraid to die.

213
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:42,000
[CHEZA]
This one knows that,

214
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:44,333
but this one has decided.

215
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:47,041
It is all right.

216
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:48,166
Kiba.

217
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,958
This one will surely
protect you.

218
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:54,541
[KIBA]
Che... za...

219
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:00,958
[HIGE] What could that
Noble want with Cheza?

220
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:04,791
I mean, what can a human
possibly hope to accomplish

221
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,166
by trying to get to Paradise?

222
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,625
Not that we really cared.

223
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:13,583
In the end, there wasn't
anything we could do about it.

224
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:16,333
Cheza was gone.

225
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,333
[HIGE]
You up an movin' already?

226
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:43,583
C'mon guys, I know we've
been through a lot,

227
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:44,833
but why all the moping?

228
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:46,625
I couldn't sleep, that's why.

229
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,416
Yeah, well, neither could I.

230
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,416
[TSUME growls] You slept
like a dead man, as always.

231
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,541
Look, I'm just as shocked and
frustrated as the rest of you

232
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,666
but none of that is
gonna help us figure out

233
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,000
what the hell to do now.

234
00:18:58,083 --> 00:18:59,750
Are we gonna live
here in a stupor

235
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:02,916
for the rest of our lives?!
Somebody say somethin', dammit!

236
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,166
Kiba!

237
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,875
You haven't said a single
word to any of us

238
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:07,083
since everything happened.

239
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:07,916
[TSUME]
Drop it.

240
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,916
[TOBOE]
Leave him alone.

241
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,916
Kiba was hurt the
worst, remember?

242
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,375
[KIBA]
It's not that.

243
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:17,041
It's just...
I'm really pissed off.

244
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:20,791
[THUG A]
She went that way!

245
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:23,541
[THUG B]
Get her! Come back, dammit!

246
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,583
She's over there!

247
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,291
[ALL gasp]

248
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,000
Wow, what a babe!

249
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:38,750
[THUG B]
She's got friends.

250
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:40,291
[THUGS laugh]

251
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:41,083
[BLUE grunts]

252
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:42,916
Yeah, so what's it to you?

253
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,666
[HIGE] So, how come those guys
were chasing you, anyway?

254
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,875
[BLUE] I thought that
I should work, y'know?

255
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:54,958
[HIGE] Work? I've never
given it much thought.

256
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:57,208
That's how supposed
to be, huh?

257
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:58,875
But it's hard to let go of,

258
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:00,583
when that's all
you've ever known.

259
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:04,041
For my entire life,
I've been at Pop's side,

260
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:08,875
always wanting to be useful
to him somehow, if I could.

261
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,458
I'll bet, from your
point of view,

262
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:14,125
choosing to live that way must
sound like complete nonsense.

263
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:15,458
But the thing is,

264
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:18,458
I was always happy
being that way.

265
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:26,708
[BLUE]
If nothing had happened,

266
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:29,541
I could have stayed
happy forever.

267
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,375
[BLUE]
I don't know what happened,

268
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:37,750
or if it really was wolves
who killed everyone.

269
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:41,333
But even so,
that's what Pops believes.

270
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:42,625
[HIGE]
Man.

271
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:46,041
And just because of that,
he hates all wolves?

272
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:48,791
[BLUE] If I had stayed
ignorant of what I was,

273
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:52,750
I would've been able to remain
at Pop's side forever.

274
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:55,083
If I had never met that girl,

275
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:59,041
I could have kept on living
the way I always had been.

276
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:01,958
If I hadn't learned that
there was some wolf in me.

277
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:03,541
[HIGE]
So what are you gonna do now?

278
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:05,583
You want to go back
to that guy?

279
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:08,541
[BLUE]
I can't go back. If I did,

280
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:10,791
I'd have to hunt
you guys down again.

281
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:13,041
[HIGE]
Heh. Sounds nice.

282
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:15,708
I wouldn't mind being
hunted down by a girl.

283
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:18,250
I'm usually the one who
does all the chasing.

284
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:21,000
But, somehow, they always
manage to get away.

285
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:24,375
Whenever I get in the mood I
always have to take a leak.

286
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:25,791
Kinda like right now.

287
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:28,416
Well go somewhere and
do it, that's disgusting.

288
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,708
I'll hold it. It looks like
you're ready to run.

289
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:37,750
[BLUE laughs]
You're nice. Gross, but nice.

290
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:40,791
[HIGE]
Yeah. I get that all the time.

291
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:43,416
[BLUE]
Hey. Why don't you come with me?

292
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,833
[HIGE]
Where to?

293
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:48,958
Doesn't matter where, does it?

294
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,958
Sounds tempting

295
00:23:17,708 --> 00:23:19,208
[HUBB]
Have you ever wanted to go back

296
00:23:19,291 --> 00:23:21,166
to an earlier part of your life?

297
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:23,250
To when things were happier?

298
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:25,791
No matter how difficult
the present may be,

299
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:28,458
there may come a time when
you find yourself thinking,

300
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:31,291
boy. I really had
it good back then.
