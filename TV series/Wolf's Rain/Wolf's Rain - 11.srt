It's because she used to talk

you're fired up, is it, runt.

But what about Cheza?

upset him that much?

163
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,083
We've got more important
things to do right now

164
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:46,750
than look for
some flower girl!

165
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,625
We will attack Jaguara!

166
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:49,583
[RETRIEVAL LEADER]
But sir...

167
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:51,833
What about our mission?

168
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:53,333
With Lord Orkham gone,

169
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:56,458
our city could suffer the same
ruinous fate as this one.

170
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:58,500
Do you really want
that to happen?

171
00:10:58,583 --> 00:10:59,875
[MEN]
No, sir!

172
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,583
[CHER]
It's magnificent...!

173
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:55,333
If I had use of this device,
I would be able to tap into

174
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:58,250
and communicate
directly with her mind.

175
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:01,375
Just as it was written
in the <i>Book of the Moon.</i>

--[door closing]
--[gasping]

177
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,125
It would appear that
I have granted you

178
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:08,333
too much freedom.

179
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:10,958
The time for dalliance is over.

180
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:15,541
You have soothed the loneliness
of my isolation long enough.

181
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:18,833
I must go now, and retrieve
the Flower Maiden.

182
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:22,458
Uh! Tell me! Do you
know where she is?!

183
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:28,291
I can sense Cheza's presence
within my very soul.

184
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:31,958
Tonight we will see a full moon.

185
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:35,208
[CHER whimpers]

186
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:49,666
So this is it.

187
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:53,041
Yeah. Right about now, I feel
like I could do almost anything!

188
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:55,541
I mean we've all seen
a full moon before,

189
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:58,458
but 'cause Cheza's with us, it's
seems different, doesn't it?

190
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:03,375
Ah! Oh, man, I just wanna
howl my head off!

191
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:06,333
Something's about to happen...

[howling]

193
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,083
[DARCIA]
The <i>Book of the Moon.</i>

194
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:44,416
For my clan, that was where
all of this first started.

195
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:51,750
[DARCIA] Within its pages lies
my grandfather's research.

196
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:56,208
An accumulation of the finest
alchemy of his day.

197
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:58,291
And every last bit of it

198
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:03,250
was intended to be a means
of reaching Paradise.

199
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:07,875
My grandfather disappeared
into Paradise.

200
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:12,583
But what, exactly, is Paradise?

201
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:15,666
[DARCIA] It is a world where
wolves reign supreme.

202
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,000
[CHER gasping]

203
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,125
Paradise will save me.

204
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:22,625
It will lift the horrid
curse that is upon me,

205
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:25,750
and that of the woman I love.

206
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:31,166
My beloved Hamona was ravaged

207
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:34,708
by what is called
Paradise sickness.

208
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,458
Her soul was stolen by Paradise,

209
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:39,791
yet she still lives.

210
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,708
[DARCIA]
Her skin has lost

211
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:47,375
the warmth that yours
still possesses.

212
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:51,541
Are you sure you should be
telling me all of your secrets?

213
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:52,875
[DARCIA]
Hm.

214
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,958
You may wait for me here.

Until I return with Cheza.

My Lord Darcia. It appears
Lord Orkham's keep has fallen.

218
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:18,916
As I thought. Jaguara
has made her move?

219
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,833
So it would seem.

220
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:23,708
The time is ripe...

221
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:35,916
It's the path to Paradise...

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,291
Is that really what it is?

going to Paradise?

yet come for that.

Hi. Lebowski here.

Personal circumstances have
forced me to resign from my job.

Spring has sprung so I'm
setting out on a journey,

where I'm sure only pleasant
encounters await me.
