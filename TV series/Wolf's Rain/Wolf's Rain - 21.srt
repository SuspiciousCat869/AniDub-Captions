00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:19,750
[TOBOE] Did you see that
flash in the clouds just now?

2
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:21,625
Look! There it is again!

3
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:23,875
I don't think it's
clouds that are flashing.

4
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:25,958
They must be reflecting
light from the ground.

5
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:29,416
It smells like
something's on fire.

6
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,208
[gunshots]

7
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:38,541
It's the stench of battle.

8
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,291
It's no use.

9
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:05,333
All communication between us
and the remaining units

10
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:07,125
in every city has been lost.

11
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:09,958
As of this moment,
we're completely cut off.

12
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:11,041
[COMMANDER]
All right.

13
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:12,208
I've heard enough.

14
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:15,458
[RETRIEVAL LEADER]
Jaguara and her damn thugs...

15
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:18,625
[SQUAD B] But... why would
she attack our city now?

16
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:20,666
They said the squad that
took control of the keep

17
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,125
seemed pretty desperate
to find something.

18
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:24,750
Searchin' for wolves...

19
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:28,416
Don't be ridiculous.

20
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,750
Why would they be
looking for something

21
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:32,208
that's been extinct
for 200 years?

22
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:33,833
[RETRIEVAL LEADER]
Don't be so sure.

23
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:35,791
Rumor has it Jaguara
still has squads

24
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:37,666
that specialize
in wolf hunts.

25
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,750
[COMM OFFICER]
Huh?

26
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:40,333
Since you just
joined up with our unit,

27
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,291
you probably haven't heard this.

28
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,333
And it may sound
hard to believe.

29
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:45,750
Our squad saw some boys

30
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:48,166
when we were sent to
Darcia's aerial city.

31
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,708
We had to fight them
when they tried

32
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:51,458
to escape with
the Flower Maiden...

33
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:54,916
And the men who were killed
were covered in claw marks.

34
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,666
[COMM OFFICER gasps]
You mean the wolves...

35
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,500
...can appear as humans?

36
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,458
[COMMANDER]
Impossible!

00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:02,916
[SQUAD B]
Commander...?

38
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,541
[COMMANDER] It's nothing
but superstitious nonsense.

39
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:10,250
If you let that garbage get
to you, you've already lost.

40
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,458
[RETRIEVAL LEADER]
We've lost?

41
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:14,208
But Commander... Lost to what?

42
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:16,833
[COMMANDER] On the battlefield,
a soldier never questions

43
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:18,000
why he's fighting.

44
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:19,125
[SQUAD B]
But the outcome of this battle

45
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:21,208
was clearly decided long ago...

46
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:22,708
So what are we fighting for?

47
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:24,250
Answer me this.

48
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,333
Who exactly do you think we are?

49
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:32,750
[COMMANDER] We're soldiers
who were hired by a Noble.

50
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,208
We still have weapons,

51
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:37,250
and an enemy that
threatens to destroy us.

52
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,166
What more reason do we need?

53
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,333
Sir, we've secured
an attack route

54
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:44,375
to the flotilla
of berthed airships.

55
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:46,791
Good. Alert the men.

56
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:48,833
Unit B will blow up
the airships.

57
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:51,416
Unit A and I will
wait by the exit.

58
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,416
We'll take out anyone
who comes out of the Dome.

59
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,541
[ALL]
Yes, Sir!

00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,291
[ALL yelling]

61
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:52,125
Those stupid humans
are killing each other.

62
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:54,750
And all for a Noble's glory.

63
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:57,041
Kiba, we should go,
don'tcha think?

64
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,458
It's Jaguara's troops.

65
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:06,666
We found 'em.

66
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:42,041
[COMMANDER]
Who are those guys?!

67
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:43,083
Huh?!

68
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:49,875
[COMMANDER groaning]

69
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:19,666
[COMMANDER]
Don't move!

70
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:28,583
[COMMANDER]
All right... Who are you?

71
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:33,958
And why the hell would
you want to rescue us?

72
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:35,666
It was unintentional.

73
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,875
[COMMANDER gasps]

74
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,875
Hey, check it out.

75
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,625
This is one of the guys that
was chasing us back in that city

76
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:44,000
where we first met Cheza.

77
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:45,708
You mean you know about Cheza?!

78
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:47,708
What are you talking about?

79
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:50,375
She's a girl who was
made from Lunar Flowers.

80
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:54,291
You're the boys...
from Darcia's city...

81
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:55,791
See? I told ya.

82
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,750
[KIBA]
Where'd they take her?

83
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,666
[COMMANDER] I thought
the Flower went with you,

84
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,041
and then...

85
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:02,666
She was kidnapped by
people wearing the same armor

86
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,875
as these idiots.

87
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:06,333
[COMMANDER gasps]
You mean Jaguara?

88
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:10,916
It all makes sense now.

89
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I never really
understood why Jaguara

90
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:15,583
would want to attack us...

91
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:19,666
Orkham... Jaguara... Darcia...

92
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,000
The Nobles would
risk everything they had

93
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:24,791
just to get their
hands on that Flower.

94
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:26,666
Look pal,
we don't give a crap

95
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,583
about what the Nobles are doin'.

96
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:29,916
The only thing we wanna know

97
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,291
is whether or not
you've seen Cheza.

98
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:34,916
No, I haven't seen her.

99
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,875
But if they did take
the Flower to Jaguara's keep,

100
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:40,750
you'll find it
by heading that way.

101
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:43,000
Out beyond the sea
of floating ice.

102
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:48,666
Wait a minute!

103
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:51,791
Tell me something...

104
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:54,333
Are you really going
to fight Jaguara alone?

105
00:08:58,083 --> 00:08:59,500
Whether I'm alone or not,

106
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:02,791
I'm always gonna fight to
protect the ones that need me.

107
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,125
No matter what.

108
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:15,958
Commander...

109
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:16,875
Were those...?

110
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:17,875
That's right.

111
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,958
So they do exist...

112
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,750
Assemble the men
from units A &amp; B

113
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,500
that are still inside the dome.

114
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:26,791
Take out any of Jaguara's troops
that got through the blockade.

115
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,166
But why, Sir?

116
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,666
Our boys are dead
thanks to her.

117
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,166
And we're gonna settle
the score right now

118
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,416
by killing the bastards
who did this.

119
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,625
You've been awfully quiet.

120
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:52,958
Are you doing all right?

121
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:54,041
[CHEZA]
Mm-hmm.

122
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:57,166
It is because
this one is not alone.

123
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:01,875
Y'know, I...
I really like your scent a lot.

124
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:03,375
It's funny, but...

125
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:07,083
Whenever I'm around you...
I get the strangest feeling.

126
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:08,916
Even at a time like this.

127
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:12,375
Why did you
let them take you

128
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,875
when they captured this one?

129
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:18,083
You could have escaped easily,
and yet you did not.

130
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:19,416
I guess you're right,

131
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,291
but I just wanted to see
things through, for once.

132
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:25,125
Pops... and Ruus, too...

133
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,916
There was nothing I could do
to protect either one of them.

134
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,708
When they both
needed me the most,

135
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:34,916
I couldn't help them.

136
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,791
Besides... I can't be with them.

137
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:40,041
Not anymore.

138
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:43,791
Because until the day I met you,
back in that city,

139
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:47,583
I'd spent my whole life
not knowing who I really was.

140
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:50,333
So I don't have any of
that wolf's pride in me

141
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:53,291
that Hige and the others
seem to thrive on.

142
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:56,291
But... maybe somewhere
deep in my heart,

143
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:58,916
I always knew what it meant.

144
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,625
That's why I decided that
no matter what happens,

145
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:04,208
I have to protect you.

146
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:06,750
I didn't mean to get
so serious on you.

147
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,000
Sorry.

148
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:12,041
It's amazing I can
talk to you like this.

149
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:14,041
You're almost
too good to be true.

150
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:17,416
Anyway...

151
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,500
I'm positive he'll be
coming for us soon enough.

152
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:20,708
[CHEZA]
Yes.

153
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:23,125
But until then,
I'll be here to protect you.

154
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:25,666
Hige...

155
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,125
You have faith in him,
do you not, Blue?

156
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:29,916
Why would you think that?

157
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,500
Faith in that sexist jerk?
Gimme a break!

158
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:38,750
[CHEZA giggling]

159
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:42,541
[BOTH giggling]

160
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:43,791
Hey Cheza.

161
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:46,958
This "Paradise" place...
What's it really like?

162
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:48,958
[CHEZA]
This one does not know.

163
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,958
[BLUE]
Oh... well...

164
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:53,041
I guess we'll find out
when we get there.

165
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,000
Looks like
they're at it again.

166
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:02,208
What's the plan?

167
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:03,708
Well, one thing's for sure,

168
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,666
we're never gonna get anywhere
if we keep attacking them

169
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,583
one by one like we have been.

170
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:08,750
I know.

171
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:11,000
It's time we headed
for Jaguara's keep.

172
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:12,666
No more distractions.

173
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,333
Cher.

174
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:32,458
What?

175
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:34,666
It's all right.
I'm with you now.

176
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:42,500
Ow!

177
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:45,625
Why do things always
work out this way?

178
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:47,250
It figures the
first chance I get

179
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,875
to have you all to myself

180
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:51,833
is with my hands tied
in the back of a truck.

181
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:52,875
[CHER chuckles]

182
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,125
That reminds me...

183
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,875
I heard some interesting news
during my interrogation.

184
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:01,291
Thanks to the House of Lords,
you and I aren't exes anymore.

185
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:02,750
What are you talking about?

186
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,666
[HUBB] Apparently,
all of the documentation

187
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:08,250
that proved we were ever
married has been destroyed.

188
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:09,416
Which would mean, of course,

189
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,666
that our divorce
never happened, either.

190
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:17,000
It's one of those happy stories
that almost makes you sad, too.

191
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:21,250
[CHER gasps]

192
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:23,958
[HUBB]
Damn it!

193
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,000
Huh?

194
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:31,958
[HUBB]
Hold still.

195
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,458
Hey Hubb...

196
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:46,958
When I get home I want
to bake some bread.

197
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:52,416
If the two of us ever
get out of this alive...

198
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:57,000
Let's go away. Find a place
where no one knows us.

199
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:59,208
[HUBB] We can build
a house by the sea

200
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:02,208
with a red roof
and a garden out back.

201
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:05,458
We'll grow giant tomatoes
and every kind of herb.

202
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:08,166
And a dog. We'll get a dog.

203
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:11,458
And then... after a while...

204
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:15,500
Let's have some kids.
A girl would be nice.

205
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:19,958
With your maternal instincts,
you'll make a terrific mother.

206
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:22,083
And after that...

207
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:23,541
We can all...

208
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,291
Is that what you really want?

209
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:33,416
That's all over now.

210
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,625
At this point it doesn't
matter what I want anymore.

211
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,750
Don't you lie to me, Cher.

212
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:41,083
It isn't over and you know it.

213
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:42,916
Why would you make
all those sacrifices

214
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,916
if you weren't going to
see it through to the end?

215
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,250
You can't give up now.

216
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:52,625
[HUBB] It'll be all right.
I'll protect you.

217
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:53,833
That's why I came.

218
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:56,833
I threw away everything
I had for this.

219
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:58,250
None of it mattered to me.

220
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:00,750
The only thing I ever
cared about was you.

221
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:05,666
Hubb...

222
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:10,958
[BOTH yell]

223
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:12,416
Are you all right?

224
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,166
Yeah, more or less.

225
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:30,916
[CHER]
Those are Lord Orkham's troops.

226
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,291
[HUBB] Whoever they are,
this is our chance.

227
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,291
You're right. Let's take it.

228
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:36,916
We have to find Cheza.

229
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,458
Cher.

230
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,791
[HUBB sneezes]

231
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:58,125
That tingle again...

232
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,541
[HUBB]
This way.

233
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,416
That's way too convenient.

234
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:14,791
Cheza!

235
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:22,000
[CHER gasps]

236
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:29,708
Isn't that Quent's?

237
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:30,625
We'll get you out.

238
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:32,000
[gunshots]

239
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:39,000
[HOBB gasps]

240
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,875
[BLUE] We've gotta
get away from here.

241
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:51,833
[CHEZA gasps]

242
00:16:58,458 --> 00:16:59,583
Hubb, move!

243
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,000
Cheza!

244
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:27,166
Hubb!

245
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,625
[CHER]
Why are you doing this?

246
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:38,583
What's the point?

247
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:41,250
Orkham and Darcia
are both gone.

248
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,333
Yes, I know.

249
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:45,833
But everybody has their
own way of surviving

250
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,166
and this happens to be mine.

251
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,916
I guess I'm just a fool of a man

252
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,583
who can only maintain
his pride through fighting.

253
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:54,125
Your pride?

254
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:56,791
We met those wolves
when Jaguara attacked us.

255
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,500
Wolves that have survived by
casting a spell over humans.

256
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:04,708
I had always believed
it was nothing more

257
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:07,041
than the ramblings
of some dreamer.

258
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,000
I never thought
it would be true.

259
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:14,541
They were all trying
to find the Flower Maiden.

260
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:18,875
The wolves will seek out the
girl created from Lunar Flowers.

261
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:21,166
Everything is happening
exactly as it was written

262
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,708
in the in the
<i>Book of the Moon.</i>

263
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:25,458
While none of us were looking,

264
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:27,666
I guess somehow
we all got mixed up

265
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,125
in a world of legend
and fairy tales.

266
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:35,541
How about we give
you a lift to the nearest city.

267
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:37,250
Thanks, but no.

268
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,541
Would you mind...
if we took that?

269
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:43,166
[COMMANDER]
Suit yourself.

270
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,125
So what now?
Where are you gonna go?

271
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:49,666
We're heading South
straight for Jaguara's keep.

272
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:53,041
I'm looking for something, too,
and I think it might be there.

273
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,416
[COMMANDER]
I understand.

274
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,500
[CHER]
What about you?

275
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:58,541
Us? We're going to Freeze City.

276
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:00,041
Huh?

277
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,916
But Sir, Jaguara's troops
have taken over the whole area.

278
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,833
[COMMANDER] This may prove
to be the one battle

279
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:07,458
that determines our fate as men.

280
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:08,875
That is why I'll fight.

281
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,625
Not for the glory of the Nobles,

282
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:13,708
but for the honor of
protecting our very existence.

283
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:17,833
We'll stand together.

284
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,416
And we'll fight
to save what is ours.

285
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:29,333
[RETRIEVAL LEADER]
Sir! The troops are ready

286
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:30,791
and await your command.

287
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:33,666
[COMMANDER] Good. You may
give the order to move out.

288
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:34,708
[RETRIEVAL LEADER]
Yes, Sir!

289
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:40,833
I'll leave the driving to you.

290
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:09,625
[CHEZA gasps]

291
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,625
What is it?

292
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,333
No doubt about it...

293
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:46,541
Let's go.

294
00:23:17,625 --> 00:23:20,291
[CHER] I can't remember the last
time I was behind the wheel.

295
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:22,666
It's a good thing
I've still got my license.

296
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:25,125
Anyway, I've always
been an excellent driver.

297
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:26,333
Wha--?

298
00:23:26,416 --> 00:23:28,458
Wait a minute, this car
isn't an automatic?

299
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:31,625
Who in the world drives
a stick anymore?
