was to stay with you.

165
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:44,125
It's not like... I believed
what you told me,

166
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:46,833
about what happen to Ruus.

167
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:52,166
I'm not gonna start...
trusting wolves because of you.

168
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:57,041
It may be hard,
but you have to believe.

169
00:10:57,125 --> 00:11:00,625
I know that wolves would never
do anything as cruel as that.

170
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:02,500
[grunts]
For one thing--

171
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:05,291
[gasps]
You alright?

172
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,291
[BLUE grunts]

173
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:10,666
[BLUE]
Talk to me!

174
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,166
Please, Pops,
snap out of it!

175
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:17,250
[grunts]

176
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:20,791
[BLUE]
Don't fall asleep!

177
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:24,458
[grunts]
C'mon! You can make it!

178
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:32,416
[BLUE]
If we keep moving,

179
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,833
I'm sure we'll run
into the others.

180
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:38,875
If we can find them,
I know we'll be...

181
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:52,791
Huh?

182
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,625
Mr. Yaiden, can you see me?

183
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:11,375
Mr. Yaiden, wake up!

184
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:15,416
Well, looks like his eyes
still seem to be working.

185
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,625
[CHER] There aren't
any major fractures,

186
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:19,708
but his brain may
have been damaged.

187
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:21,916
You don't think Pops
is gonna die, do you?

188
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,291
[CHER]
It's alright.

189
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,208
Although, it will
take some time for him

190
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:27,000
to regain his strength.

191
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,458
Oh...

192
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:36,000
[CHER]
I saw Paradise.

193
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:37,916
[HUBB]
What?

194
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,583
[KIBA]
I saw it.

195
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:42,583
The Paradise that the
Nobles tried to open.

196
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:45,041
[TOBOE]
The Nobles' Paradise?

197
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:48,791
[KIBA]
Yeah. But it was a fake.

198
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,291
Now I know.

199
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:55,291
Paradise is something that
must be opened by the wolves.

200
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:59,083
There's only one place that
can be called Paradise.

201
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:02,625
And I suppose that's
the way it should be.

202
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:03,666
[gasps]

203
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:09,375
[HUBB] So that's what the
celebration was for.

204
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,125
[HUBB]
Do you think there is a chance

205
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:14,666
that we can go there, too?

206
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,916
[CHER]
No. I doubt it.

207
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,083
Then, what the hell
are we supposed to do?

208
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:21,458
[CHER]
The only thing we can do.

209
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:23,166
Die out.

210
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,750
[HUBB]
Why?

211
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:28,416
[CHER] Because the world would
become distorted with us in it.

212
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,208
And yet in a new world,

213
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:33,166
one that was created by
the spirit of the wolves.,

214
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,291
I'm sure there'd be
new humans as well.

215
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:39,500
So we're all bunch of pawns
to be thrown away, huh?

216
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:42,291
Ha. That suits me just fine.

217
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:46,208
[CHER] Y'know, I think
I understand now.

218
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,625
Why you and I
never had children.

219
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:53,416
[CHER] On some level, we knew
the world was ending.

220
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,458
It may have seemed like we found
something else to obsess over,

221
00:13:56,541 --> 00:14:00,208
but the truth is,
we'd given up on the future.

222
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:05,083
That's the real reason I was
never able to get pregnant.

223
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:07,291
[HUBB] Do you still
feel that way?

224
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:11,500
What shred of hope am I supposed
to have left after all this?

225
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:14,625
[HUBB] I'm here.
Together, with you.

226
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:18,125
Something that I'd almost given
up hope on has come true.

227
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:20,083
Whatever happens to the world,

228
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:23,083
Cher, I wanna have
faith in the future.

229
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,875
You really have changed.

230
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,083
[BLUE]
Stop! Stop the car!!

231
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:41,958
[TOBOE]
Hige! Hang in there!

232
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:51,416
[BLUE]
Hige!

233
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,083

[gasps]
Cheza...

236
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:21,416
It seems like things
are falling apart

237
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,041
faster than we
could've imagined.

238
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:27,875
Is leaving this stupid planet
the only way to stay alive?

239
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:29,458
If only we could fly away.

240
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:32,500
Maybe find another
world somewhere.

241
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:33,500
[KIBA]
Why?

242
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:34,708
[HUBB]
Huh?

243
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:37,458
[KIBA] Why do humans
always look to the sky?

244
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:39,708
Why do you all try
so hard to fly

245
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:42,166
when you don't have any wings?

246
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,708
We use what we've been given.

247
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:48,666
We'll run on our own legs
for as long as it takes.

248
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:58,208
Where is Kiba? And the others?

249
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:01,958
Don't worry Cheza. It's okay,
they're following us.

250
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:03,250

Hey, Hubb.?

252
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:07,916
[HUBB]
Hm?

253
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,541
[CHER]
Haven't you noticed?

254
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:10,458
[HUBB]
What?

255
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:12,750
[CHER]
You stopped sneezing.

256
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:15,458
Huh? You're right, I have.

257
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:18,916
My allergy's totally gone.
Maybe I built up a tolerance

258
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,375
after being around
wolves all this time.

259
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:23,666
I don't really
think that's how--

260
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:27,458
Who knows, maybe you did.

261
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:31,708
After what we've seen,
I think anything is possible.

262
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:34,458
Yeah. You got that right.

263
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:37,541
[CHER] And the most
impossible thing of all...

265

[CHER]
...Is you.

266
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,541
You gave up everything
to find me.

Oh, Hubb.

You've become...

It's because I have you
to look out for now.

We'll start over.

285
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:41,291
We can begin from scratch.

286
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,208
And this time... we'll have
a house full of kids.

287
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:52,750
Make bread every morning.

288

And then we'll...
we'll get a bird.

A little white one.

It'll be everything
we ever wanted.
