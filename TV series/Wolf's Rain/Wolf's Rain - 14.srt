1
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,208
Kiba!

2
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:16,000
[HIGE]
Damn it, will you wait up?!

3
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:17,875
[panting]

4
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:20,750
C'mon You're goin' too fast.

5
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:22,041
Let's take a break.

6
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:23,583
We don't have time for that.

7
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:26,041
Would you use your
head for once!

8
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:28,291
We've got a girl and
a little kid with us.

9
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:30,500
[BLUE]
I can hear you, y'know.

10
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,875
Don't worry about me.
I can keep up.

11
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:34,500
Yeah, me, too!

12
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:37,083
You realize he's the one who
wants to rest, don't you?

13
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:38,750
I do not! I just...

14
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:41,875
But you've gotta admit,
he does have a point.

15
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:47,666
At this rate, none
of us will make it.

16
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,750
We can take shelter in those
rocks till the storm clears.

17
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:55,375
That settles it, then.

18
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:57,250
Can you guys hang
in a little longer?

19
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,708
[BLUE] Just worry about
yourself, all right?

20
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:02,333
[HIGE]
Yes ma'am. Sorry.

21
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:05,583
Let's go.

22
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:26,500
The sun'll be up soon.

23
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:29,250
We should rest here until then.

24
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,750
What do you say, Kiba?

25
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:33,625
I mean, the storm will blow
itself out by morning.

26
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:35,916
[KIBA]
It already has.

27
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,541
[BOTH gasp]

28
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:40,041
Come on. It'll be fine.

29
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:42,500
Well, none of us will be fine!

30
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,458
Do what you want, I'm leaving.

31
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,125
[BLUE]
Look, I can handle it.

32
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:48,958
[TOBOE]
Yeah. Let's get going.

33
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:50,041
[HIGE]
No!

34
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:52,791
I'm not goin' anywhere
till morning.

35
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:56,041
I understand.

36
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:57,125
Kiba!

37
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:58,125
Let him go.

38
00:03:58,208 --> 00:03:59,416
[TOBOE]
But, why...

39
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,291
Right now, the only thing
he can see is Cheza.

40
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:06,416
It doesn't make any difference
whether we're with him or not.

41
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,125
We'll follow him once
the storm blows over.

42
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:12,583
For now, just get some rest
and don't worry about it.

43
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:17,500
Hige. Y'sure about this?

44
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:19,250
[HIGE exhales]

45
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:20,875
He obsesses too much.

46
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:22,791
What can ya do?

47
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:37,083
[snoring]

48
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,166
So, I take it...

49
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,250
you didn't like the
scarf that much, huh?

50
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:59,000
It's really too bad, I
thought it suited you.

51
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:01,750
Uh. I guess not.

52
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,250
[laughing]

53
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,916
You lunkhead.

54
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,416
[CHER]
Cheza is...

55
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:24,166
a girl made from lunar flowers
by utilizing an ancient alchemy.

56
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:28,333
It was Lord Darcia the
First who created her.

57
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:31,416
[CHER]
She was stolen by Lord Orkham

58
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,333
and brought to the
lab for us to study,

59
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:36,625
hoping that we could awaken her,

60
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:39,375
and open the gates of Paradise.

61
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:42,208
[HUBB]
Paradise...?

62
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:45,583
[CHER] It's a world where
wolves reign supreme.

63
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:47,833
They're drawn to
the Lunar Flower

64
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:49,875
because it's the one
thing that can guide

65
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:53,250
the world's remaining
wolves to Paradise.

66
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,125
Tell me, Cher.

67
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:04,541
Did you know about all of this
from the very beginning?

68
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:06,833
Then who told you?!

69
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,333
Wait a minute.

70
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:12,375
You mean, at the keep
we're headed towards...?

71
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,500
[QUENT]
A world full of wolves, huh?

72
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:21,916
If that's what you
call Paradise,

73
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,458
I'll take my chances in
Hell any day of the week.

74
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:27,541
[HUBB]
Quent, you were awake?

75
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:31,041
[QUENT] Hey, what can I say,
it's too cold to stay drunk.

76
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:32,375
The <i>Book of the Moon.</i>

77
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,833
It isn't just a fairy
tale, you know.

78
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:35,916
[QUENT]
Maybe.

79
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,458
But even if you're right,

80
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:42,458
there's nothing we humans can
do about it now, is there.

81
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:45,333
I'll never be able to
forgive the wolves.

82
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:47,125
Not after what they did.

83
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:50,583
Even if they are the "supreme
rulers" of this rotten world,

84
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:54,041
I'm gonna eradicate
every one of them.

85
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,625
My Lord Darcia. Inside
the keep, there's...

86
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:50,625
[DARCIA]
A wolf?

87
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:53,250
Yes.

88
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:57,375
[DARCIA] My love, now
that I have lost you,

89
00:07:57,458 --> 00:08:02,541
Paradise holds no meaning
for me. And yet...

90
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:04,625
[DARCIA whimpers]

91
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:07,791
[DARCIA]
This wolf's eye throbs...

92
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,708
Why?

93
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:14,375
What is this feeling that
threatens to overwhelm me?

94
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:16,916
My beloved Hamona.

95
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,250
Tell me. What should I...

96
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:38,958
He is here.

97
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,791
So, this is the keep of Darcia.

98
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,666
Place looks like it
should be haunted.

99
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,791
By what...?

100
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:01,041
By the ghosts of all
the cursed Nobles.

101
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,416
C'mon, don't say
stuff like that.

102
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,791
But still,

103
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:07,458
are you sure that girl
is inside of there?

104
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:09,875
[sniffs] The scent is faint,

105
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:12,916
but it's definitely
a Lunar Flower.

106
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:21,500
[TSUME]
He's got visitors.

107
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:25,166
[gasps]

108
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:28,166
Hey, hold on!

109
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,333
Pops is here.

110
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:40,375
[HIGE] Blue, what is it?
What's gotten into you?

111
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:41,583
[TOBOE]
Come on!

112
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:50,750
[HUBB]
Who are the Nobles, anyway?

113
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:52,625
[CHER] There was extensive
literature dealing

114
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,125
with the Nobility,

115
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:57,208
but most of it was lost with
the decline of civilization.

116
00:09:57,291 --> 00:10:00,583
Yet, there are some
things we do know.

117
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:04,125
They say that long before the
world became as it is now,

118
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:07,416
the Nobles extolled the
virtues of this culture.

119
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,916
By using an amazing
form of alchemy,

120
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,166
they blazed a path to the stars

121
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:15,375
and opened the doors
to space and time.

122
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:19,625
But in an instant, all
of it simply vanished.

123
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,875
No one really knows
what happened then,

124
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:24,833
but many people disappeared.

125
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:27,708
The development and
execution of their alchemy

126
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:32,375
came to be a secret known
only to the remaining Nobles

127
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:37,125
that was never to be
passed on to the people.

128
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:40,875
All of that happened
almost 200 years ago.

129
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:45,833
And now what remains of this
world is slowly fading away.

130
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:48,708
Along with the blood red moon.

131
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:53,458
He is here.

132
00:10:58,583 --> 00:10:59,625
[gasps]

133
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:07,791
[gasps]

134
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:11,833
Cheza!

135
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:13,333
Kiba!

136
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:24,583
Why the hell are you
in such a rush?

137
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:27,958
It's Pops. I know he's here.

138
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:30,875
But do you really
wanna see him?

139
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,541
That Pops guy?

140
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:39,000
No. It might be
better if I didn't.

141
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:41,375
But maybe the reason
he's out here...

142
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:43,166
is to find you.

143
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,625
[TSUME]
So... What if he is?

144
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,458
Are you gonna go back to
being that human's dog?

145
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:51,875
Hey, lay off!

146
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:53,500
Yeah, Tsume, be quiet!

147
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:55,000
You don't know what it's like.

148
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,500
Guess I don't.

149
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:59,375
Unlike the two of you, I've
never had the "pleasure"

150
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,541
of being kept as a pet.

151
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:04,333
Now, now. Let's find
Kiba and Cheza.

152
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:06,250
We can fight later.

153
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,833
The flower scent's
comin' from over there.

154
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,791
The worship of wolves, huh?

155
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:23,958
But it's not just a
simple animal cult.

156
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:25,458
It's deeper than that.

157
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:28,500
I think the vision of this
world has split somehow.

158
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:30,541
There's one we humans can see

159
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:33,958
and one we must've lost
sight of at some point.

160
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:37,791
I'm fairly certain the
animals are aware of that.

161
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:40,000
Including the wolves?

[sneezes]

163
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,958
What the hell
brought that on?

164
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:47,208
[HUBB] I have a terrible
allergy to dogs.

165
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:48,916
[sneezes]

166
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,458
That a fact?

167
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:52,666
Then they must be over this way.

168
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,833
Those allergies sure
do come in handy.

169
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,833
[HUBB]
Glad I could help.

170
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:15,458

Cheza!

[DARCIA growls]

175
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:59,916
[DARCIA] So, wolf.
Have you come for revenge?

176
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,875
[KIBA]
You... will not... hurt Cheza!

177
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:07,458
Cheza. She is a being
that we created,

178
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:10,500
the mere embodiment
of a Lunar Flower.

179
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:13,875
Why is it that your desire
for her so desperate?

180
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:16,125
[KIBA] I don't know
who you Nobles are,

181
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:17,875
or what you're tryin' to do.

182
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:20,833
And to be honest,
I don't really care.

183
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:22,791
Cheza's all that matters.

184
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:26,041
She'sgonna show us
the way to Paradise.

185
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:28,125
You damn wolf...

186
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:31,916
All of this first began
with your wretched breed.

187
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:39,000
[HUBB]
What is it?

188
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:40,416
Hey!

189
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:50,125
[DARCIA]
It's because of you...

190
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:53,250
You and your kind stole
everything from me.

191
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:55,791
And in return you
gave me a curse.

192
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:59,208
And grief. And suffering.

193
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:00,833
And my eye

194
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:04,250
transformed into
one such as yours.

195
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:08,041
The price I paid for being
cursed by Paradise.

196
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:09,958
And now...

197
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:13,875
the only thing that
surrounds me is despair.

198
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:15,291
[KIBA]
Don't!

199
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:19,291
What is it, what do you want?!

200
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:21,000
[DARCIA]
Have you found it?

201
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:23,125
Have you found Paradise?

202
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:26,000
[KIBA]
We will. No matter what!

203
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
[DARCIA] And what do you
expect to find there?

204
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:31,666
[KIBA]
A future.

205
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,416
[DARCIA]
A future...?

206
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,958
[KIBA]
Not hope...

207
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:38,833
or despair.

208
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:42,291
Just a future. Nothin' more.

209
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:52,166
I no longer have any need...

210
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:55,833
for a... future.

It's over, wolf.

No, don't!!

Cheza.

We have to hurry.

00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,250
How could you...?

226
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,041
Why, Blue?

227
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:44,875

Did that wolf just
say something?

246
00:23:17,791 --> 00:23:20,458
[NEIGE] A human life
is an ephemeral thing.

247
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:24,083
It is always wise to look back
on one's past from time to time.

248
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:27,625
But perhaps my life is a trifle
too long to dwell upon.

249
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:31,666
And so, I bid you adieu.
