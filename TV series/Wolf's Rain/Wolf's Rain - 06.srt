1
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:03,333
Guess the hunt
has started, huh?

2
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:05,625
Y'know, Zali, if
those kids get caught,

3
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,708
they could be
handed over to you.

4
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:11,291
If that happens, they'll
be forced to work for us.

5
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:13,625
And we're gonna
work 'em like dogs.

6
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:17,125
[MOSS chuckles]

7
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:18,958
They'll feel right at home.

8
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:20,333
And then, before you know it,

9
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:23,083
they'll start thinkin'
this is Paradise.

10
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:24,416
[ZALI]
Tell me,

11
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,833
when did you start lookin'
at things that way?

12
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:27,916
What's that?

13
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,666
Like one fallen so
low and desperate.

14
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:34,166
Yeah right.

15
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,166
[chuckling]

16
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,208
You think you're any different?

17
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:41,416
Come off it, Zali.

18
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,750
We're only acting this way

19
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:45,250
because we're all
following your lead.

20
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:49,416
[MOSS]
Hmph.

21
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:02,250
[TOBOE] This should
hopefully help his wounds

22
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:03,500
heal a little faster.

23
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:07,625
It's typical. He never
thinks first. Damn Kiba.

24
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:12,916
He couldn't watch that without
doing something about it.

25
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:16,375
Still, he shouldn't
have butted in.

26
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:18,500
[TOBOE]
Tsume.

27
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:20,708
Let's just go. Get
the hell out of here.

28
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:23,208
But... we can't
move Kiba now.

29
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:26,708
Which is exactly why we shoulda
gotten outta here yesterday.

30
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:28,166
Whatever happened to,

31
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,708
"Living here had more going
for it than you thought"?

32
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:31,750
[HIGE]
Hmph.

33
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,125
Let's go.

34
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:37,541
Wait. You're not going
anywhere with these wounds

35
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,250
and an empty stomach.

36
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:42,833
Well, I know somebody here
who has a stuffed gut.

37
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:44,875
Hey, you were the
ones who didn't eat.

38
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,500
Cole was nice enough
to bring us food

39
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:48,041
and you turned up your noses.

40
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:50,791
It's rude to let food waste.

41
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:53,000
I had no choice but to
eat it all by myself.

42
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:54,583
Someone had to do it.

43
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:56,750
You coulda left us some.

44
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:58,875
Well, you were the ones who
wandered off by yourselves,

45
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:00,125
not me.

46
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:03,666
Did you have a nice time
on your little date?

47
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,166
I don't know.

48
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,666
There was somethin' about her
that seemed kinna lonely.

49
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,833
[TOBOE sighs]

50
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,208
[TOBOE] So, what do we do?
We gotta do something.

51
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:16,000
Oh, like impose on Cole's
hospitality for a while?

52
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:18,500
No, like you get us
something to eat.

53
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:19,458
By yourself!

54
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,583
By myself?!

55
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:22,625
[TSUME]
Hm-hm.

56
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:23,833
[groans]

57
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:25,750
All right, I'm goin'.

58
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:32,250
[TOBOE] I'll go find more
herbs for his wound.

59
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:50,083
Moss and the others
left to go on patrol.

60
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:54,375
When did our pack
first begin to split?

61
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:56,750
I must've been blind
not to see it coming.

62
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:58,291
Zali.

63
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:01,833
[ZALI] Am I the only one who
didn't notice it was happening?

64
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:03,208
Maybe.

65
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:07,250
Either that or I simply
chose not to see it.

66
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,250
I need to ask you something.

67
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:12,458
Do you really think that living
here is what's best for us?

68
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:14,916
That there's... nothing else?

69
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:21,458
I thought that the
appearance of those boys

70
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:24,458
would change you back
into a man you used to be.

71
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:27,958
When they told us that
they were searching

72
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:29,875
for the way to Paradise,

73
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:31,916
I was hoping that it
would breathe some life

74
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,041
into this city.

75
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,041
They're still very young.

76
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:38,000
And everything we've gone
through is different.

77
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:41,500
No, it's not. They're walking
down the same road you did.

78
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:46,708
[COLE]
Was there really no Paradise?

79
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:53,250
That dream is over,
we've already awakened.

80
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:57,375
We all believed that one day,
we could go to Paradise.

81
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,916
[ZALI]
But the group I lead,

82
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,541
the ones that put trust in me,

83
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:09,833
didn't find the Paradise
they were hoping for.

84
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:13,958
The tunnel was
filled with toxic gas.

85
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:19,375
I lost so many of
my friends that day.

86
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:22,583
I couldn't bear to lose
any more of the pack.

87
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:28,625
I brought back
those who survived,

88
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:31,875
and we carved out a life
for ourselves in this city.

89
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:34,916
And I thought,

90
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,166
when you came back for me,
you'd say, "We found Paradise."

91
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,458
By now I think
everyone's realized.

92
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:46,458
All the island's
machinery is dead.

93
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:49,250
The gas no longer exists!

94
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,500
You could go back to the
path and try it again!

95
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:52,666
[ZALI]
Cole!

96
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,125
It's too late now. It's over.

97
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:24,500
Hey.

98
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,708
You know, we've all wasted
the hell of a lot of time

99
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:29,333
because of you.

100
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:31,375
The others have gone
off to look for food.

101
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:35,333
What were you up to last night?

102
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:38,291
I know you didn't get all
those wounds at the station.

103
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:42,916
Not like I care or anything.

104
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:48,583
[KIBA] I saw them once
before. When I was little.

105
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:49,583
Huh?

106
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,958
I was still just a cub.

107
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:56,208
In the region where I was born,
they had blossomed all over.

108
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:58,083
What're you talking about?

109
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:01,000
[KIBA] White flowers
that only bloomed...

110
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:03,083
...under a full moon.

111
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:05,541
They were Lunar Flowers.

112
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:08,750
They were...
all burned to ashes.

113
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:11,041
What the hell brought this on?

114
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:13,458
A fire raged across our land.

115
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:16,416
It burned all the
flowers in an instant.

116
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,750
And all...

117
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:20,125
...all of my friends whose
escape route was cut off

118
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,750
were killed.

119
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:27,166
I was the only one...
who survived.

120
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:31,291
Why me? Why just me?

121
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:34,875
I don't have... a pack anymore.

122
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:38,083
The only place for me now...

123
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:39,666
...is Paradise.

124
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,500
If it was really that
easy to find food,

125
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:11,000
I guess Zali's pack wouldn't
be doing what they're doing,

126
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,625
now would they?

127
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:13,666
Huh?

128
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:17,500
All right! I smell fresh mutton!

129
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,250
[gasps]

130
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:33,791
[HIGE]
Oh crap! Get me outta here!

131
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,333
My fangs are way too
delicate for this.

132
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,458
[HIGE]
Hm?

133
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:52,458
Oh good, it's you.
I'm glad you're here.

134
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:54,958
So wolves still get
caught in traps like that

135
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:56,416
even today, huh?

136
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,458
[HIGE chuckles]

137
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,625
[HIGE]
Yeah, am I ever embarrassed.

138
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:04,083
Well, that's what happens
when you get all cocky.

139
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:05,375
I'm sorry.

140
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:08,625
So, uh, you think maybe
you can open this, now?

141
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:11,458
Whadd'ya think?
Should we help the kid out?

142
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:14,250
These little brats keep
meddling with our business.

143
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,541
They've been trouble
from the start.

144
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:19,333
[HIGE]
I, uh...

145
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Look! I'm sorry!

146
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,125
Come on, let me out!

147
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:28,583
What's your problem?!

148
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:31,375
Are you gonna just stand
there and watch me die?

149
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:32,916
Why shouldn't I?

150
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,500
You stuck your nose where it
don't belong. This is our turf.

151
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:39,041
Oh, is that right?!

152
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:42,083
Well, I wouldn't want help from
a bunch of old dogs, anyway!

153
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:43,541
What?!

154
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,875
You're not wolves,
you're not even dogs!

155
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:47,291
You're lower than humans!

156
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:48,666
[MOSS]
You little punk!

157
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,958
Hey! Caught one right
off the bat, huh?

158
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:02,625
And it's a big one, good.

159
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:06,041
[MOSS] Nah, it's too wild.
It'd be better to put it down.

160
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:10,458
[TOBOE] What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?

161
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:35,583
Whadd'ya think you're doing?

162
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:39,166
[KIBA]
I'm all right. I can move now.

163
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,291
Kiba! Are you all right?

164
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:44,166
[KIBA]
Yeah... Sorry...

165
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,583
You're by yourself?

166
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:46,750
Where's porky?

167
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:49,000
That's just it! He got caught!

168
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,333
In this really big trap,

169
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:53,625
and then... and then they
took him away somewhere!

170
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:55,625
All he has to do is fool
the humans who caught him

171
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:57,000
and then he can get away.

172
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,333
[TOBOE]
But he can't!

173
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:00,458
He was knocked out by
those wolves that we saw,

174
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:01,833
the ones that live here!

[TSUME gasps]

176
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:06,541
Why the hell would they
do something like that?

177
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:07,583
Where were they headed?

178

[TOBOE]
I don't know!

179
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,875
Why didn't you give us
a warning by howling?

180
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:13,333
And what're you
doing here, anyway?

181
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:14,750
You should've followed them!

[TOBOE]
Oh, yeah, you're right.

183
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,291
[KIBA]
Let's go.

184
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:20,375
Where to?

185
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:21,625
[KIBA]
The city.

186
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:30,291
This is taking forever!

00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,958
Hey, cut it out!

If we don't,
they're gonna kill him!

Tsume, you can put me down.

191
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:48,291
I can walk on my own now.

192
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:54,791
Right, let's get a move on.

193
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:00,833
That's the lady.
The one from yesterday.

194
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:09,291
Well, now.

195
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:11,958
It looks like last night's
beating didn't sink in.

You mean you ordered this?

00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:24,250
[ZALI]
Ordered what?

201
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:25,416
Don't play dumb!

What're ya talking about?

Is it true what we heard?

That you sold out our
friend to those humans?

Just how low will
you mongrels sink?

That guy said to kil him!

209
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,583
I heard you tell those

This is my pack!

Why in the hell did you
sell out their friend?

213
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:06,500
He's an outsider, that's why.

214
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:09,875
Zali. Isn't it you who's been
selling out your friends?

What?!

It's the truth and you know it.

You don't even do a dog's work!

218
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:18,916
Is that how you really feel?

219
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:24,166
[ZALI] I always
thought as the leader,

220
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,625
I did what I had
to do for the pack.

221
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:30,375
Without letting my personal
feelings get in my way.

222
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:33,458
Everything I've done
was to protect the pack.

223
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:36,666
Yeah, well, none of us sees
you as the leader anymore!

Where did they take 'im?

Tell me, where they took
their friend, Moss.

[TSUME] You don't have any idea
where they might've taken him?

234
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,875
They had him on the back
of an orange truck.

235

If you plan to give up
on Paradise and turn back,

now might be the time.

to go back to.

been able to find Paradise,

no doubt in my mind...

like he'd be pretty strong.

Yeah, but it's a royal pain
to tame dogs that big.

impossible to control.

feel sorry for it.

really isn't my thing.

There's nothin' left for me now.

for... ain't here anymore.

So, where are you headed?

00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,625
[QUENT]
Hm. Good question.

271
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:09,958
I'll let my dog lead the way.

272
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:13,041
[BARTENDER] Ha. Seems
pretty haphazard to me.

273
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:16,166
[QUENT] Never underestimate
a dog's nose.

274
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:37,958
You've butched yourself
up a bit, I see.

275
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,833
We need to talk.

276
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:43,041
Well, that's it
for me I'm done.

277
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:44,541

Have you ever seen this?

278
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:45,583
[QUENT]
Heh?

279
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:49,541
Is what's written inside
this just made up?

280
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:53,041
Or black magic? Or a dream?

281
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:54,875
Or reality?

282
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,041
Interpret it however you want.

283
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:09,333
[QUENT] Okay, Blue.
Whadd'ya say we get going?

284
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:10,750
[HUBB]
Just a minute.

285
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:13,166
Cher, the woman who
left this book for me...

286
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,458
...she suddenly disappeared.

287
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:18,333
Something horrible is
happening, isn't it?

288
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:21,125
It's not as if my
life has ever felt

289
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:23,000
that peaceful or anything.

290
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:26,833
I've always had this strange
sense of restlessness inside.

291
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:30,666
But I could never get
a handle on what it was.

292
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,416
[QUENT] Does it seem like
the moon's getting closer?

293
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,166
[HUBB]
Huh?

294
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,875
And glowing red?

295
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:39,500
As if the whole thing
were burning up?

296
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:42,666
[HUBB] Does that mean the
destruction of the moon?

297
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,666
That the world is
coming to an end?

298
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,750
I have no idea.

299
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:50,666
Maybe it just means
my eyes are goin' bad.

300
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:54,916
But as long as I can see, I'm
gonna search for those wolves.

301
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,750
You should look for your woman.

302
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,125
Blue.

303
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:00,416
If she's important
to you, that is.

304
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:08,125
Oh, Cher.

305
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:25,916
[TOBOE]
This is the only way, right?

306
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,541
Are you sure this
tunnel is really safe?

307
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:32,750
I'd say it's better than being
burned up with the trash.

308
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:42,833
This is as far as I plan to go.

309
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:45,541
From here on out,
you're all on your own.

310
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:47,708
You mean you're not
coming with us?

311
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:50,250
You're gonna
keep living here?

312
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,083
[ZALI] I don't know if
the place we tried to find

313
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:54,041
was real or not.

314
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:55,625
But I believe that
there are some

315
00:20:55,708 --> 00:21:00,791
that can make it to Paradise,
and there are some who can't.

316
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:02,625
I'm convinced of that.

317
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:07,208
And it's time for you to
find out for yourselves

318
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:09,250
if the real Paradise does exist

319
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:11,041
somewhere at the
end of this road.

320
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:14,083
[TSUME] You know, you don't
seem like much of a wolf.

321
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:15,000
[KIBA]
Tsume.

322
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:16,666
A wolf protects his own.

323
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,625
It's not natural for it to
look after another pack.

324
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,416
You're right. I guess
I really have fallen.

325
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:34,541
[ZALI]
Flowers are clever things.

326
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:36,291
Even if it looks
like they've vanished,

327
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:38,000
they never really go away.

328
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:41,666
You know, like a pack of wolves.

329
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:45,750
As long as there's a moon,
Flowers will never die.

330
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:47,833
And neither will us wolves.

331
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:22,208
[QUENT] Sometimes you see things
in this world that defy belief.

332
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:25,583
When that happens, you
have only two choices.

333
00:23:25,666 --> 00:23:28,666
You either believe what you
see with your own two eyes,

334
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,458
or you give up drinkin'.
