[HUBB] I hope we're going
in the right direction.

00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:04,083
Paradise is somewhere
up ahead, isn't it?

[CHEZA]
Yes, it is.

Are you in any pain?

Heh. It's so strange.

6
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:16,750
I'm not sure when,

7
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:20,000
but at some point
I started to believe.

8
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:21,041
In all of it.

9
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:26,083
You, the wolves... and Paradise.

10
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:28,875
I'm seeing the world
clearly for the first time,

11
00:01:28,958 --> 00:01:31,208
just as it's about to end.

12
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,375
I'm a little too late, huh?

13
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:35,375
[CHEZA]
It will not end.

14
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:38,166
But simply begin again.

15
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:43,208
[CHEZA] It is so...
that it can be reborn.

It was all just
a misunderstanding.

22
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,416
Wolves didn't do it. Ruus and
Mom didn't die because of them,

23
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,875
and they weren't the
ones who attacked Kyrios.

24
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,208
It was all
because of Jaguara.

It could be severe dehydration.

Either that, or he's convulsing
from internal bleeding.

Is there something
we can do?

This one'll be fine.

Thank you, Cheza,
You've done enough.

56
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:21,791
Looks like he's resting now.

57
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:25,208
Yeah. I'm pretty sure
he'll wake up soon.

58
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:28,291
Well, if he comes to and
sees we're still around,

59
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,458
won't he just pass out again?

60
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,250
The whole idea of going
to Paradise with us

61
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:36,875
isn't gonna sit too well.

62
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:39,541
It'll probably drive the
old guy out of his mind.

63
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,083
[BLUE]
That's not true.

64
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,250
Pops has changed.

65
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:47,500
He accepts me for
what I really am now.

66
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:50,208
Back there on the road,
he protected me.

67
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:53,125
Even after I told him
that I was part wolf.

68
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:55,458
So all the times he
tried to kill us;

69
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:58,583
it was just because of a
simple misunderstanding?

70
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:00,208
It wasn't simple,

71
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:03,833
but it was probably all he
had left to hold on to.

72
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:05,458
Hige...

73
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:07,708
I think his hatred of wolves

74
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:11,166
is the only think that's
kept him going up until now.

75
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:36,291
[gasps]
I was just checking on him.

76
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,958
His body feels a
lot warmer now.

[gasps]

80
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:47,416
When we found him passed out
in the mountains a while ago,

81
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,416
he held onto me as tight as
he could, there in the snow.

82
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,333
He thought I was you.

83
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,208
The whole time I was thinkin',

84
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:59,416
"Blue must really
mean a lot to him."

85
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,375
I have to admit, I was jealous.

ever happens to me,

89
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:11,250
I want you to look
after Pops, okay?

90
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,416

Paradise together, you hear me?

I know, but still...

94
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,250
[TOBOE]
You don't feel sick, do you?

95
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:27,250
No. I just figured that
if something did happen,

96
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,541
out of everybody here,

97
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:31,375
you would be the one
I could leave him to.

98
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:33,166
Well, yeah, but...

99
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:36,458
I mean, of course I'd
look out for him, Blue.

It's okay, he's sleeping.

114
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:08,583
You might as well try
to get some rest, too.

115
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:10,500
We'll check on
him in the morning.

Of course, there's
no way to tell

117
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:14,375
if it's night or day anymore.
Not that it matters.

I'm scared.

Pop's is going to react

when he wakes up
and sees all of us.

I don't think he'll
have any hard feelings.

[HUBB]
Where are you going?

167
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,875
They want to go to
Paradise together, huh?

168
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:36,208
What a nightmare.

169
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:38,750
If you're tellin' me this
is what's really happened,

170
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,458
then you should'a let me die.

171
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:42,041
What's wrong with you?!

172
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:45,541
Do you have the slightest idea
how worried Blue was about you?!

173
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:49,833
I know how much you
want to be with her!

174
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:51,166
Why are you acting like this?!

175
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,458
[QUENT]
Shut up!

176
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:57,541
Blue. You're not my dog anymore.

177
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,958
[gasps]
But you can't.

[QUENT grunts]

179
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:22,125
[HUBB]
Come on, Quent!

180
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:24,708
How long have you been in
league with those animals?

181
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:26,833
[HUBB] You're wrong,
it's not like that!

182
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:30,083
I thought you were trying
to find that woman of yours.

183
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:35,958
[HUBB]
I did.

184
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:37,375
She's here with me.

185
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:43,083
[HUBB]
Don't you remember?

186
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:45,208
She was the one who
found you and Blue.

187
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:52,375
[HUBB]
And then... then she...

188
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:54,041
Don't you understand?!

189
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:57,041
The entire world is
falling apart. It's all over!

190
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:01,375
[HUBB]
There's nowhere left to run.

191
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:05,041
[QUENT] Then you can find
your own place to die.

[QUENT] That's the one
instinct we all share.

194
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,833
[HUBB]
Oh, stop being so stubborn!

195
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:12,541
Now, let's go!

Don't you say
another word to me.

199
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:20,875
Blue's free.

200
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,625
She can do what she wants now.

201
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:24,250
Come on, Quent.

202
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:28,083
Heh! Don't make me feel
worse than I already do.

203
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:29,833
Huh?

[BLUE]
Hige?

207
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:46,166
Where are you planning to go?

208
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:49,708
Well, where do ya think?

209
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:50,750
[BLUE]
It doesn't matter.

210
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:53,791
Wherever it is,
I'm going with you.

211
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,416
But, Blue...

212
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,833
Where you go, I go.

213
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:03,041
I take it, Paradise isn't
on the list, right?

214
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:04,791
Well, I'm still going with you.

215
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:07,625
What are you saying Blue?
You mean you're not gonna--

216
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:10,041
How many times do
I have to say it?!

217
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:15,166
And besides, I doubt I
can get in to Paradise.

218
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:18,083
After all, I'm only part wolf.

219
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,750
Paradise probably
wouldn't take me.

220
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:23,125
But I...

221
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:26,083
I was one of
Jaguara's wolves.

222
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:28,125
There's no way I could
go to the same world

223
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:29,375
as Kiba and the others.

224
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:30,541
Then stay with me.

225
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:33,666
[HIGE] But what about
the old man, Blue?

226
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,666
Is it okay that you won't
be with him anymore?

227
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,125
And that...

228
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:41,000
And that you'll never
get to Paradise?

229
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:44,458
The only thing that
matters now, is you, Hige.

230
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:47,833
If I can be with you
when the world ends,

231
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:49,708
it'll be enough for me!

I've known it from
the very beginning.

235
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:06,958
It was wolves.

236

Standing there in the fire.

237
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:11,833

Mocking me.

238

It's that sound!

and such sadness.

249
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:02,208
[KIBA]
What happened, Cheza?

250
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:04,958
Was something
hurt by that light?

251
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:08,166
We must go to it. Take this one.

252
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,916
[TOBOE] Hige and the others
haven't come back yet!

Kiba, stay close to Cheza.

254
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:17,166
I'll go after Hige and Blue.

[TOBOE]
Got it!

257
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:23,416
So you sensed it, too, huh?

258
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,375
I felt it early on
at Jaguara's keep.

259
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:27,875
At first,

260
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:30,625
I thought he only planned to
leave us after we got there.

261
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:33,750
But this started long before
he got his memory back.

262
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,916
Yeah.

263
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,875
I know all about betrayal.

264
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:40,958
But he didn't betray us.
You know that.

265
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:43,000
[TSUME]
You're right.

266
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:45,625
Hmph. But when it's
all said and done,

267
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:48,708
he was trying to fool us
up until the very end.

268
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:54,958
After all this, he still
couldn't tell us the truth.

269
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:56,958
[KIBA]
But you and I could feel it.

270
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:00,958
We both knew he was
hiding something.

271
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:03,708
Isn't that right?

Heh. It's human nature.

That's just the kind of
stupid creatures we are.

286

We don't have
"righteous dignity"

like you wolves.

288

We gotta to have
something to hold on to.

289
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:57,875
Something we can resent.

290
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:59,250
And hate.

291
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:00,750
And envy.

292
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,125
And something
we can love.

You are not permitted
to enter this land.

[DARCIA]
You can go no further.

310
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,500
I will not allow it.

311
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:14,958
I saw that eye...

312
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:18,291
...glaring at me
through the fire.

313
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:20,583
What the hell are you?

314
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:22,333
A human?

315
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:25,000
Or are you a wolf?

316
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:28,000
[DARCIA] I am neither
man nor beast.

[QUENT]
Well whatever you are,

318
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:32,916
I know a wolf's
eye when I see it.

319
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:38,500
[QUENT] When a human loses
something precious to him,

320
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:42,291
he loses his soul along with it.

321

Do you know what that's like?

322
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,500
[DARCIA]
Indeed I do.

323
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:49,875
[QUENT] You stop at
nothing to take revenge

324
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,375
on the person who
stole it from you.

325
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:54,166
Without mercy.

Yes... and without forgiveness.

[QUENT] The way he leaves this
world is important to a man.

333
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:22,750
Anything's better than
dying in the gutter.

334
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:24,125
If it were up to me,

335
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:27,541
I'd shuffle off these
mortal coils in my own bed.

336
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:28,875
Damn, it's cold.

337
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:31,291
Some vodka would be nice...
