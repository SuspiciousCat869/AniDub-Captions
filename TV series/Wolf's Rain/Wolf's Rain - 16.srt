1
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:53,708
[TOBOE] I never imagined that
I'd be able to come this far.

2
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:57,708
I guess I didn't think I'd
ever set out on a journey.

3
00:01:57,791 --> 00:02:02,250
But one day, I found
myself all alone.

4
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:05,000
I didn't know what
else to do, y'know?

5
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,458
Here. Try some o'these,
they taste better.

6
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:31,916
Come on, you can have 'em.

7
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,250
You're hungry, aren't you?

8
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:42,208
They're not poisoned
or anything.

9
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:45,916
See, it's fine.

10
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:56,833
Where'd you come
from, little fella?

11
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:58,875
If you wander around
here too long,

12
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:01,333
the dog catchers will
get you for sure.

13
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:02,875
Uh!

14
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:10,833
Y'sure are warm,
aren't you, boy.

15
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:11,541
[LEARA'S DAD]
Leara!

16
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:12,833
[gasps]

17
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,291
[LEARA]
Bye, now.

18
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:20,291
[LEARA]
No, stay. Sorry boy,

19
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:26,041
but even if you followed me
home I couldn't keep you.

20
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:30,041
Well that's funny, it's almost
like you can understand me.

21
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:32,250
I'm sorry.

22
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:39,416
[TOBOE]
At that moment,

23
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,416
all I could think about
was how nice she was

24
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,666
and how great it would be
if I could live with her.

25
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:54,500
Uh... Uh!

26
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,375
Thanks a lot, for before.

27
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:57,333
[LEARA]
Huh?

28
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:58,708
For the sausages.

29
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:00,000
[LEARA grunts]

30
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:02,416
Uh. Remember,
back in the alley?

31
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,708
Well, that was my dog
you gave them to.

32
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:07,541
[gasps] That beautiful
dog belongs to you?

33
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:09,833
That beautiful... Uh yeah!

34
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,166
Yeah, he's mine!

35
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,708
But how'd you
know about it?

36
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:14,000
Um, I...

37
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:16,166
I heard it from the
lady at the store.

38
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,416
What's the name anyway?

39
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,833
Uh, name?

40
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:21,458
[laughs] The name is Toboe.

41
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:22,708
Toboe?

42
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:24,750
[laughs] Whatta weird name.

43
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:28,000
You think so? M'yeah,
I guess it is.

44
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:30,583
[LEARA]
My name is Leara. What's yours?

45
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:32,125
I just said. It's Toboe.

46
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:34,000
I thought that was
your dog's name.

47
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:36,500
[TOBOE]
Uh. Well, we're a lot alike.

48
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:38,958
So I decided to name
him after myself.

49
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:41,125
You're pretty weird, all right.

50
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:44,125
[laughs]

51
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,708
[gasps] Leara!

52
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:56,666
Here. It's your bird.

53
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:12,625
[TOBOE]
Hey. Wake up.

54
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,000
Leara.

55
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,125
He's dead.

56
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:20,250
My bird's dead.

57
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:23,666
But I...

58
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,833
I didn't mean to
kill him, I swear!

59
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:27,291
[LEARA]
Uh...

60
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,750
I knew it was yours
and I just wanted to...

61
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:39,958
I didn't... think
it would die.

62
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:53,541
[TSUME gasps]

63
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:12,041
I never meant
to kill anything.

64
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,833
[TOBOE]
Granny she...

65
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:18,916
I was all alone at the
entrance to the dome,

66
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,583
and she was so nice to me.

67
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:26,125
She said I was so little
my eyes had barely opened.

68
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:27,958
She gave these to me,

69
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:30,083
and we lived together
ever since.

70
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:32,541
You mean she kept you as a pet.

71
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,208
That human tamed you.

72
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:36,333
You're nothing more
than an obedient dog.

73
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:37,625
[TOBOE]
I wasn't!

74
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:41,291
I... I only... I wanted
to protect her,

75
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,291
but... she still...

76
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:45,958
[TSUME]
She still threw you out?

77
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:48,625
[TOBOE]
She still died.

78
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,541
She died...

79
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:56,291
[TOBOE]
I... let her die.

80
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:10,500
[TOBOE] What does he know?
I'm fine by myself.

81
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:17,041
Uh, oh. Must have
taken a wrong turn.

82
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:17,833
Huh?

83
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:19,708
Hey! It's one of our own!

Move it, will ya?

85
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:24,125
[sighs] That's the last
time I trust your nose.

86
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:25,708
Well, anyone's nose
would go numb

87

after a night in
that stink hole!

to see you again.

about your bird.

something wrong with you.

You're not normal! How can
anyone ever trust you?!

107
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:18,125

you so you could trust me.

Don't come any closer!

here to catch me?!

No!

Come on!

[TOBOE] If we stay here
we'll have to spend the rest

113
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:34,000
of our lives in
hiding, or worse.

114

We can't live with the humans
anymore and survive.

to, all right?!

[TOBOE]
Our journey had begun.

122
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:53,708
The road is rough and
we've got nothing to eat.

123
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:57,500
It's much harder than when I
was back in the city, but...

124
00:08:57,583 --> 00:09:00,500
I don't know, it's kinda nice.

125
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:03,791
It feels like I've got
my friends with me.

126
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:18,250
[TOBOE] I had a dream
that we reached Paradise.

127
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,000
Oh, it was so amazing.

128
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:22,416
There were all these red 'n
blue flowers blooming

129
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,416
as far as the eye could see.

130
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,166
And you know what, they
were all Lunar Flowers!

131
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,375
Have you ever seen a
Lunar Flower before?

132
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:32,666
Well, no, not really...

133
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,583
The scent is really faint,

134
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,708
but it's Lunar Flowers,
all right.

150
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:36,625
Because they obviously don't
know anything about Paradise.

as Paradise.

We know because
we've been there.

And, I'm tellin' ya,
it wasn't Paradise.

160
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,125
That place was more like hell.

[OLD WOLF] Look. That's
the entrance over there.

[TOBOE]
Huh?

00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:04,833
[OLD WOLF] There have
been many young wolves

164
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,583
that have set out through there.

165
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:11,458
But, sadly enough, not one of
them ever reached Paradise.

166
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:13,291
[HIGE]
Ah, geez, that reeks.

167
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:16,125
Smells like death warmed over.

168
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:21,208
[TOBOE] I wonder what
Paradise is really like?

169
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:25,000
[TSUME] So tell me,
you still believe in it?

170
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:26,458
Believe in what?

171
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:29,458
Paradise. There's
no such place.

172
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:34,916
They said they've been there but
apparently it was no Paradise.

173
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,291
We'd be stupid to keep going.

174
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:38,625
Don't say that.

175
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:42,000
Besides, getting angry
just makes you hungrier.

176
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:45,666
Maybe we can feed off Kiba's
confidence for a while.

177
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,500
[KIBA]
It's not confidence.

I'm not sure what it is.

179
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,291
But it's always there,
screaming inside of me.

180
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:56,250
I just have to know.

181
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:57,500
I have to get there,

182
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:00,375
that's why I've kept on
running all this time.

00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:04,208
I can't imagine living
without believin' in it.

Why the long face?

Given up on going to Paradise?

It's not safe for a kid to

The train makes a quick stop.

It gives the humans

It's the only way we can
