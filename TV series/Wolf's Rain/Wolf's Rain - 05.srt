Doggies!

3
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:50,625
[TOBOE] I had a dream
that we reached Paradise.

4
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:52,375
Oh, it was so amazing.

5
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:54,291
There were all these
red 'n blue flowers

6
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:56,583
blooming as far as
the eye could see.

7
00:00:56,666 --> 00:00:59,333
And you know what, they
were all Lunar Flowers!

8
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:02,541
Have you ever seen a
Lunar Flower before?

9
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:05,416
Well, no, not really.

10
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,166
But Granny was there, too.

11
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,291
And she took care of us
and she cooked for us

12
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:11,333
and made us all kinds
of delicious food.

13
00:01:11,416 --> 00:01:12,875
What're you talking about?

14
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:16,083
I guess he'll be happy being
somebody's pet even in Paradise.

15
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:17,583
It's not what you're thinking.

16
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:20,625
It was like a party and we
were all treated like guests,

17
00:01:20,708 --> 00:01:22,791
and there was great music
playing and everything.

18
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:25,666
It sounds like a city
coffee shop to me.

19
00:01:27,041 --> 00:01:30,041
But it's the truth, Hige!
It was so amazing.

20
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:33,291
It made me think that
this was really Paradise!

21
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:35,833
It's kinda hard to describe.

22
00:01:35,916 --> 00:01:39,166
[HIGE] Well, with a brain
like yours, whadd'ya expect?

23
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,541
Gimme a break.

24
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:42,750
Not even Kiba's told me what
Paradise is really like,

25
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:44,708
so how am I suppose to know?

26
00:01:46,625 --> 00:01:48,833
What color are
Lunar Flowers anyway?

27
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:50,333
Can you tell me that?

28
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:08,291
[TOBOE]
What is it?

29
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:12,750
The ocean.

30
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:32,916
The scent is really faint, but
it's Lunar Flowers, all right.

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,916
Guys, this is it!

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,541
Paradise is right up
ahead, I know it!

33
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,166
You smelled Fowers, huh?

34
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,833
Well, all I smell is the stench
of some old rancid oil.

[TOBOE yelps]

36

Man, what a crappy city.

37
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,041
Do you think they're
all afraid of us?

38
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:16,791
Not used to visitors,
that's for sure.

39
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:20,875
What the hell are we supposed
to find here, anyway?

40
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:23,041
This is some Paradise.

Where are you boys from?

44
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,125
A city to the north.

00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:46,500
[ZALI]
Why are you here?

46
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:48,208
Just passin' through.

47
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:50,458
You don't expect us
to do business here

48
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:52,833
in a dump like this?

49
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:54,833
Well, then, where're you going?

50
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:56,583
Where're we going?

51
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:58,000
To Paradise.

Kiba, why are they laughing?

55
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:13,625
Because they obviously don't
know anything about Paradise.

[TOBOE, HIGE]
Huh?

59
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:29,625
It's nothing but
a stupid legend.

60
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:31,041
[TOBOE]
Legend?

61
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:34,875
That's right, kid, there's
no such thing as Paradise.

62
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:37,000
What makes you say that?

63
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:40,291
Maybe because we've been
there. We've all seen it.

64

[TOBOE, HIGE gasp]

65

And, I'm tellin' ya,
it wasn't Paradise.

66
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,541
That place was more like Hell.

67
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:50,500
Well, that's no surprise.

68
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:54,291
You'll all find out soon enough.

69
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:58,541
You'll see that Paradise
isn't worth looking for.

70
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:01,458
Now, why don't you
all just get lost?

you belong, don't you?

Come on, Kiba, let's go.

73
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:08,875

hang around here.

just gave me the brush off.

Yeah, right, you're not exactly
one to talk, you know.

What'd you say?

00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,125
It's just, in a couple a years,

00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:37,958
we could be just
like those guys.

This city is scary.
Doesn't feel right.

There may be a lotta wolves
that live around here,

but this place is really cold.

Well, maybe they're right,

00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:50,041
the sooner we get out of here,
the better off we'll be.

[KIBA] And where do you think
we should go, exactly?

There has to be something here.

Look how many wolves
are in this city.

89
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,583
I think we should
stay and find out.

[FOREMAN]
Yeah, yeah.

00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:09,291

me is always too old.

the job done, don't they?

Sure, but for how long?

workers or not?

How you used to be
in the old days.

satisfied with our life here?

Yeah, sure I am. This life
suits us all just fine.

[COLE] Can you say that with
as much pride to those boys?

[MOSS] Those kids went off
toward the graveyard.

105
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:06,250
I doubt anyone will see 'em.

106

[ZALI] Fine, just keep
a close eye on 'em

until they leave town.

Don't worry, when they
find they can't get food,

they won't stick
around very long.

Unless, of course, you wanna
train 'em so they can work here.

Leave the thinkin'
to me, got it?

only take care of our business.

Uh? I was only digging
a hole for myself.

137
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:53,041
A hole for yourself?

Are you saying you're
digging a grave?

Well, when you
get to be my age,

you begin to recognize
when your time has come.

141

[TSUME] You might wanna
dig a little faster then.

[TOBOE]
I thought I was a goner, too.

Excuse me,

144
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:09,875
but do you know of any
Lunar Flowers in this city?

145
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:12,458
Ohh... Oh!

146
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:15,166
A Flowerbed that
went on forever.

[OLD WOLF]
Long, long ago,

148
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:21,833
they bloomed all
over this island.

149
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:24,458
But then one day
they were all dug up.

150
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:27,375
And now there isn't
a single petal left.

151
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:29,375
A long time ago, huh?

152
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:32,250
Hey, can you tell us
what color they were?

153
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:33,583
What color?

154
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:37,458
Well, let's see.
The color of the moon.

155
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:41,125
And what about Paradise?
Have you been there?

156
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:43,625
[OLD WOLF] Oh, every wolf
goes in search of it.

157
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:46,458
I myself tried to find it once.

158
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:47,708
What'd you do?

159
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,458
[OLD WOLF] Look. That's
the entrance over there.

[TOBOE]
Huh?

Ah, that reeks.

162
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:12,250
Smells like like
death warmed over.

163
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:15,416
I was kinda hopin'
it'd be a nicer place.

164
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:22,666
I wouldn't.

165
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,750
There have been
many young wolves

166
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:26,666
that have set out through there.

167
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:31,291
But, sadly enough, not one of
them ever reached Paradise.

168
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:34,791
And what's left for
the ones that return

169
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:37,083
is to eke out a living here.

Just like the rest of us.

Okay, old man, I think
you should call it a day.

172
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,791
Don't forget, there's
work to do tomorrow.

173
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:51,666
I see. Well, I've
dug it deep enough.

174

Wait a minute.

175
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,791
When you and your pack
tried to get to Paradise,

176
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,208
is this the path you took?

177
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:58,541
I thought I told you
it doesn't exist.

178

Zali.

I'll show you no mercy.

181
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,958
Now get outta town
before dawn, is that clear?

182
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:27,041
[TSUME] So tell me,
you still believe in it?

183
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,541
Believe in what?

184
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:31,708
Paradise. There's no such place.

185
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:37,666
They said they'd been there, and
apparently it was no Paradise.

186
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:41,875
Well, maybe what they found
wasn't the real Paradise.

187
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:45,500
Ugh. Where the hell does all
that confidence come from?

188
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,958
Anyway, you know it's hopeless.

189
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:51,583
There's absolutely no guarantee

190
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:54,166
that we'll ever
reach it, either.

191
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,250
We'd be stupid
to keep going.

192
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:57,666
Don't say that.

193
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:01,208
Besides, getting angry
just makes you hungrier.

194
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:02,791
Maybe we should just
hang around here

195

and die in the gutter.

196

Start digging some
holes like that old man.

[KIBA]
It's not confidence.

I'm not really sure what it is.

I've kept runnin' all this time.
