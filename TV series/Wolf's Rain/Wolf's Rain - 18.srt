1
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:30,291
[QUENT]
Blue! Don't go too far!

2
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:35,333
[BARTENDER]
Wolves? Heh.

3
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:38,708
I haven't heard about them
since my Grandpa was alive.

4
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:41,000
He always used to tell me
when the world finally

5
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:42,041
comes to an end,

6
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,291
Paradise will appear
on the Earth.

7
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:46,791
But, the trouble is
that only wolves

8
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:48,625
would know
where to find it.

9
00:00:48,708 --> 00:00:49,958
Who knows...

10
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:52,416
maybe the world is coming
to an end right now.

11
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,583
[thud]

12
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:55,625
Wolves are only
servants of Death!

13
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:59,083
Don't you believe all
that pagan garbage!

14
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:00,375
Relax, old man.

15
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:02,541
Wolves have been
extinct for 200 years!

16
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:05,041
It's just a kid's fairy tale.

17
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:07,375
[QUENT] The thing
about a fairy tales is,

18
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:10,291
there's always
some truth in 'em.

19
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,541
[HUBB]
My name is Hubb Lebowski.

20
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:51,708
I'm a detective on the
Freeze City police force.

21
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:54,708
Or, at least, I used to be...

22
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:57,250
My life was pretty
straight forward,

23
00:02:57,333 --> 00:03:02,166
but after meeting this man,
all of that changed.

24
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,500
[HUBB]
Quent Yaiden.

25
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:06,916
So, tell me,

26
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,958
what brings the sheriff of
Kyrios to our humble city?

27
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:12,375
That's a heavy artillery
you've got, there.

28
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:16,833
But I doubt you came all
this way for the hunting.

29
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:19,125
[QUENT]
What did you do with it?

30
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:21,708
Where's the animal I put down?

31
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:22,916
[HUBB]
Dead, apparently.

32
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,125
[QUENT]
Huh?

33
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:25,958
[HUBB] The carcass will
be disposed of here.

34
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:27,625
That's impossible!

35
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,416
There's not a chance in
hell that thing is dead.

36
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,291
Don't you get it, it's a wolf!

37
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:33,916
You think it's a wolf?

38
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,208
[QUENT] It may look like a dog,
but it's not. It's a wolf!

39
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:42,291
These wolves exist and we
have to destroy them all!

40
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:48,125
So, do you think
it's really a wolf?

41
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:49,708
[CHER]
I don't know.

42
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:52,708
I've never seen a
real one before.

43
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:54,125
But if it is a wolf...

44
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:57,416
it may be what's causing
the sudden reaction in Cheza.

45
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,958
[HUBB]
Oh, please. Not Cheza again...

46
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,833
What's that mean?

47
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:04,750
It's because of her
you and I broke up.

48
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,708
[HUBB]
Cheza.

49
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:11,916
The crowning achievement
of an ancient alchemy.

50
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,541
My wife... uh... my ex-wife
was among those in charge

51
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:20,375
of a top-secret research
project for one of the Nobles.

52
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:23,000
The Flower Maiden
and the wolves,

53
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:26,500
two being that existed
only in legend.

54
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:29,625
Was that animal really a wolf?

55
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:35,500
[HUBB] It's gone. Do you
think someone stole it?

56
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:39,625
Could be. Or, maybe it
escaped on it's own.

57
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,541
[QUENT] You're obsessed
with the wolves, huh?

58
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:48,416
Heh, heh. You're dyin'
to know everything, now.

59
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,208
Isn't that right, Detective.

60
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,208
The dog you shot ran away.

61
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:54,125
What a surprise.

62
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:57,375
And you think it put some kind
of a spell on us to escape?

63
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:58,875
You got it.

64
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:01,333
There's a lot more
of 'em, y' know.

65
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:04,583
People you pass everyday on
the street or in the market...

66
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:07,125
The poor slob sittin'
next to you in a bar.

67
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:10,166
Any one of 'em could be a wolf.

68
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:14,208
"I tell you now the
words of Red Moon.

69
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:16,583
From the Great Spirit
was born the wolf

70
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:19,541
and man became its messenger."

71
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:22,958
In other words, the human
race was created from wolves.

72
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:26,208
So says the author of
the <i>Book of the Moon.</i>

73
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:28,000
<i>Book of the Moon?</i>

74
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:30,333
I guess I might as well say it.

75
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,166
Instead of lookin' for wolves,

76
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,041
you oughta start
suspecting humans.

77
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,000
Everything's fine.

78
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,833
The lab's power supply is
independent from the main grid.

79
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:01,041
[DARCIA]
Yes, I know.

80
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:02,541
[CHER]
Uh!

81
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:09,750
[DARCIA] Cheza, is not vital
to you. Is that correct?

82
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:11,083
Uh. Who are you?

83
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:13,708
[DARCIA]
Everyone is resting now.

84
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:16,791
You look exhausted as well.

85
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:23,250
[DARCIA] So tired. You
should rest a while...

86
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:40,541
[HUBB] Cher disappeared, leaving
me the key to her apartment.

87
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:46,583
[HUBB] In the midst of all
that neatness and order,

88
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:49,666
I found something.
the <i>Book of the Moon.</i>

89
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,791
An arcane volume written
by Darcia the First,

90
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,958
an alchemist of
unparalleled genius

91
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:58,333
who had vanished
over 200 years ago.

92
00:06:58,416 --> 00:06:59,750
Why was it here?

93
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:03,541
What was Cher doing with a
book that was now banned?

94
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:12,583
It's a faint signal,
but it's moving.

95
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:15,958
Commander. She must be
somewhere inside that vessel.

96
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:17,916
[COMMANDER]
Can you be certain?

97
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,416
I'm sure. These readings
confirm it.

98
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:24,125
Cheza's awake and she's
reacting to something.

99
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:45,708
[DARCIA]
Don't do it!

100
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,791
Oh, no!

101
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:27,666
I can't believe that 10
of our men were injured

102
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,666
while we let them escape.

103
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,833
But they won't be able
to get away from us,

104
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:33,708
not from this aerial city.

105
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,916
[CHER] Commander, who do you
think those boys really are?

106
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,958
[COMMANDER]
I would imagine

107
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:40,500
they're some of Lord
Darcia's people.

108
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,833
To be honest, I am not so sure.

109
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:44,541
That expression,

110
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,833
that the Flower Maiden had
her own face when she was

111
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:48,833
running with those boys.

112
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:50,875
Cheza was smiling.

113
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:54,166
She was smiling, as if
she were truly happy.

114
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,166
[gasps]

115
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,250
[CHER gasping]

116
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:05,583
[CHER] Have you heard of how
wolves might still be alive,

117
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:07,041
even today?

118
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,208
[COMMANDER]
No, I haven't.

119
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:10,333
[CHER]
There's very real possibility

120
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:11,750
that these boys we saw,

121
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:14,416
aren't ordinary humans.

122
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,416
They could be wolves who've
learned to survive

123
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,250
by deceiving us.

124
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,916
[MEN cheering]

125
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:32,458
A glass of whatever'll
warm me up.

126
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:33,500
[BARTENDER B]
Yes, sir.

127
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:34,791
I'd like a chilled
sherry, please.

128
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,125
[BARTENDER B]
Yes, ma'am.

129
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:42,875
[BOTH exhale]
Hit me again.

130
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,625
[HUBB] I don't know
how long it's been

131
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:47,416
since I started
searching for Cher.

132
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,000
The lab where she
worked was shut down

133
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:54,125
and all the researchers
had gone into hiding.

134
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:56,208
I even took a stab at
getting information

135
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:58,291
concerning the Nobles.

136
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:01,708
At that point I would have
risked almost anything,

137
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:04,625
and then, finally...
I got a lead.

138
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:06,166
[sighs]

139
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:11,458
It's Cheza. She was stolen by
someone over a month ago.

140
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:12,583
[HUBB gasps]

141
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,000
[HUBB]
What about Cher?!

142
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:17,041
Doctor Degre went with
the retrieval team

143
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:19,166
to help find the flower maiden.

144
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,333
[HEAD DETECTIVE]
Let's just leave it at that,

145
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:23,333
shall we, Detective Lebowski?

146
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:24,833
[HUBB grunts]

147
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,958
The House of Lords
has issued a warrant

148
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:29,041
for your immediate arrest.

149
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:31,875
Please, come with me.

150
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:52,833
[HEAD DETECTIVE]
An invasion?!

151
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:55,666
But, Lord Orkham is what?!

152
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:00,958
[DETECTIVE]
Hubb! Are you all right?

153
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:02,541
Don't worry, it's
not you're fault.

154
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:05,125
But still... how
did this happen?

155
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:07,041
I guess I was deceived...

156
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,083
Do you mean by wolves?

157
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:09,875
[explosion]

158
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:11,750
What the hell's goin' on?

159
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,125
[DETECTIVE yelps]

160
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,875
Sorry, pal.

161
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:23,166
[DARCIA] The <i>Book of the</i>
<i>Moon.</i> For my clan...

162
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:26,958
that was where all of
this first started.

163
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:31,416
Within its pages lies
my grandfather's research,

164
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:36,083
an accumulation of the finest
alchemy of his day.

165
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:38,125
And every last bit of it

166
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:42,958
was intended to be a means
of reaching Paradise.

167
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:47,666
My grandfather...
disappeared into Paradise.

168
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:51,958
But what exactly is Paradise?

169
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:55,291
[DARCIA] It is a world
where wolves reign supreme.

170
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:56,708
[gasps]

171
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,875
Paradise will save me.

172
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:02,208
It will lift the horrid
curse that is upon me,

173
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:04,958
and that of the woman I love.

174
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,958
[DARCIA]
My beloved, Hamona,

175
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:13,791
was ravaged by what is
called Paradise sickness.

176
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:20,500
Her soul was stolen by
Paradise, yet she still lives.

177
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:25,250
Her skin has lost the warmth
that yours still possesses.

178
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:31,500
My Lord Darcia, it appears
Lord Orkham's keep has fallen.

179
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:35,041
As I thought. Jaguara
has made her move.

180
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:38,000
The time is ripe.

181
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:45,750
Lord Darcia. Aerial city, huh?

182
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:46,666
Hm?

183
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,916
[gasps]

184
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:52,208
[HUBB]
Wolves,

185
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:54,500
the Flower Maiden,

186
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:58,208
and the blood red moon.

187
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:00,333
One by one, everything
that was written

188
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:03,875
in the <i>Book of the Moon</i>
is coming true.

189
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:07,125
Is this really the
end of the world?

190
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,250
[gasps]

191
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:35,416
[gasps] Lord Darcia,
you're here.

192
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:40,458
[NEIGE] Lady Jaguara's
reach extended even here.

193
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:42,208
Jaguara.

194
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:44,375
[NEIGE]
Please forgive me.

195
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:48,041
I tried, but there was nothing
I could do to protect her.

196
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:50,625
[DARCIA yells]

197
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,875
[BARTENDER A] Well, If you've
come all this way to find her,

198
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:58,166
she must've done something
pretty awful, huh?

199
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:01,875
Yeah. She's a master criminal
with a face of the angel.

200
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:04,208
Hey, wait. That's the woman.

201
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:05,833
You know, the one
who drank like a fish.

202
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:07,458
Y'mean, you saw her?

203
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:08,541
[BARTENDER B]
She was throwin' 'em back

204
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,541
with that old guy over there.

205
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:11,583
Uh!

206
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:15,375
You again.

207
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:18,333
So, I take it your search for
the wolves is going well.

208
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:21,125
And where's your dog? Was she
too headstrong for you?

209
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:24,541
[QUENT] I guess she was.
She ran off on me.

210
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,541
[QUENT] I've always
had this suspicion...

211
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:31,250
Ever since my boy found
Blue and brought her home,

212
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:32,875
even though she
was just a pup.

213
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:35,875
I figured she had some
wolf blood in her.

214
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,416
That's the reason she was able

215
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:42,000
to track down the
wolves so well.

216
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:44,666
Wanna go up the road?
Check out the next town?

217
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,750
The what?

218
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:47,333
[QUENT]
If she was still in the area,

219
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,416
you should've bumped
into her by now.

220
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,708
And since you haven't, my guess
is she's either gone back home,

221
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,916
or she's moved on
to the next city.

222
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,083
Cher would never go back. Not
with the way things they are.

223
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:03,125
[QUENT]
Well then, that settles it.

224
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:11,625
Hubb!

225
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,208
Cher!

226
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:21,875
Hubb, what are you...?
How did you...?

227
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:23,958
Is this a dream?

228
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:25,000
I can't tell.

229
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:28,250
I've had so many
dreams about you.

230
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:30,000
[sneezes]

231
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:37,541
I met him. I met Darcia.

232
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:38,750
[HUBB gasps]

233
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,416
[CHER]
I'm sorry, Hubb.

234
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,333
I can't tell you how happy I am

235
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:45,416
that you came all
this way to find me.

236
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,250
But I have to go.

237
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:48,541
But why, Cher?!

238
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:50,333
[CHER]
Please, try and understand.

239
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:53,208
I have to find out
Cheza's true purpose.

240
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:54,875
I'm being drawn to
something, Hubb,

241
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:57,750
and I need to know what it is.

242
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:00,458
All right, then
I'll go with you.

243
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:05,958
Then why the hell did you leave
this thing for me to read?!

244
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:12,000
I'm going with you.

245
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:35,375
What is it?

246
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:36,666
Hey!

247
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,250
[DARCIA]
It's because of you.

248
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:41,416
You and your kind stole
everything from me.

249
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,958
And in return you
gave me a curse.

250
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:45,541
And grief.

251
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:47,000
And suffering.

252
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:51,916
And my eye transformed
into one such as yours.

253
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,916
The price I paid for being
cursed by Paradise.

254
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,125
And now, the only thing
that surrounds me...

255
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:02,000
is despair.

256
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:07,500
[KIBA] Don't! What is it,
what do you want?!

257
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:11,500
[DARCIA] Have you found it?
Have you found Paradise?

258
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,916
[KIBA]
We will. No matter what!

259
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,208
[DARCIA] And what do you
expect to find there?

260
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:20,000
[KIBA]
A future.

261
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:23,375
[DARCIA]
A future...?

262
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:26,750
[KIBA]
Not hope, or despair.

263
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:30,000
Just a future. Nothin' more.

264
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:40,250
I no longer have any need...

265
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:43,916
for a... future.

266
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:09,875
It's over, wolf.

267
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,125
No, don't!

268
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:15,958
[gasps]

269
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:20,750

00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:32,166
My Lord Darcia!

Cheza!

275
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,625
Blue, no!

276
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,750
How could you...?

277
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:51,000
Why, Blue...?

278
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,625
Blue!

279
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:01,583
[CHER]
Jaguara!

00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:03,041
[growling]

281
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:06,541
[BLUE]
That way!

282
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:07,541
[CHER gasps]

283
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:09,541
Did that wolf just
say something?

284
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:14,208
[CHER whimpers]

285
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:23,500
[DARCIA]
I can see you whenever I like.

286
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:25,708
[HAMONA]
I know we will meet again...

287
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:29,000
[DARCIA]
Yes... someday soon...

288
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:36,541
[HAMONA]
I love you... Darcia...

289
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:10,708
[KIBA] They say there's no
such place as Paradise.

290
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:13,666
Even if you search to
the ends of the earth,

291
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,083
there's nothing there.

292
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:18,041
No matter how
far you walk,

293
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:23,375
it's always the same road.
It just goes on and on.

294
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:28,916
But in spite of that, why
am I so driven to find it?

295
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:47,666
[KIBA]
A voice calls to me. It says...

296
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:51,166
"Search for Paradise."

297
00:23:17,666 --> 00:23:19,500
[KIBA]
I'm afraid you're out of luck.

298
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:21,416
You will not find what you seek

299
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,708
and those you await
will not come.

300
00:23:23,791 --> 00:23:26,375
But there is a hint
of new love in the air.

301
00:23:26,458 --> 00:23:29,208
Now's when your honesty
will be put to the test.

302
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:31,250
Your lucky color is white.
