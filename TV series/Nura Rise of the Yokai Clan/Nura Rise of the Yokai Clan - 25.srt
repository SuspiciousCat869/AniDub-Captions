-They've finally arrived.

00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:59,737
-Yes, it seems so,
Supreme Commander.

00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:00,237
-Hm?

TSURARA: "The Moon
is in the Sky."

00:02:40,837 --> 00:02:42,337
-What is this power?

7
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,204
It's so strong.

-Get back, Shoei.

00:03:08,137 --> 00:03:10,370
-You're in no
condition to fight.

12
00:03:10,404 --> 00:03:14,404
A commander puts his life
on the line, doesn't he?

13
00:03:28,204 --> 00:03:29,970
-Come on let's get going.

14
00:03:47,304 --> 00:03:50,137
-Hey, where are all the yokai?

15
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:50,937
-Huh?

16
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,104
Kiyotsugu.

17
00:03:52,137 --> 00:03:55,304
-Hey, Ienaga, Yura,
you're already here.

18
00:03:55,337 --> 00:03:56,837
YURA: Where were you guys?

19
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,570
IENAGA: We were
trying to reach you.

20
00:03:58,604 --> 00:04:01,570
-In any case, I'm glad
you two could join us.

21
00:04:01,604 --> 00:04:02,904
Now where are all the yokai?

22
00:04:02,937 --> 00:04:04,570
Have you seen any around here?

23
00:04:04,604 --> 00:04:07,637
There are countless posts on
the Kiyojuji Paranormal Patrol

00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:11,570
Homepage about yokai
sightings in this area.

25
00:04:11,604 --> 00:04:14,737
Hey, yokai, where are you?

26
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:15,237
Hey!

27
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:26,737

We can fight to our hearts'
content-- Fear against Fear.

30
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:34,537
-I'm afraid I don't
know of any fools.

31
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:35,904
I have comrades though.

32
00:04:40,004 --> 00:04:43,904
-Anyone who stands at the
top has no need for comrades.

33
00:04:43,937 --> 00:04:46,604
I will be the Lord of
Isolation and reign over

34
00:04:46,637 --> 00:04:49,204
the corpses of all yokai.

35
00:04:49,237 --> 00:04:52,870
-Your eyes are blinded by
arrogance, but I'll fix that.

36
00:04:52,904 --> 00:04:56,470
-Anyone who dares look down on
me cannot be allowed to exist

37
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:57,070
in this world.

38
00:05:00,104 --> 00:05:01,570
-Over there.

39
00:05:01,604 --> 00:05:03,304
Master Rikuo!

40
00:05:03,337 --> 00:05:05,404
-Look at that class
of yokai aura.

41
00:05:05,437 --> 00:05:06,604
-It's unbelievable.

42
00:05:06,637 --> 00:05:09,504
In all my years, I've never
seen a battle like this.

43
00:05:09,537 --> 00:05:11,137
-This is amazing.

44
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:13,037
-Master.

45
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:15,370
Kejoro.

46
00:05:15,404 --> 00:05:19,070
-If I were you, I'd have
faith in the man I love.

47
00:05:24,737 --> 00:05:27,504
-Hey, are you seeing
yokai over there?

48
00:05:27,537 --> 00:05:29,670
-Wait, don't go.

49
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:30,870
-Why not?

50
00:05:30,904 --> 00:05:34,004
-Because what's happening
is way over our heads.

51
00:05:34,037 --> 00:05:35,337
Just forget it.

52
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:40,070
-Well, If an onmyoji herself
says so, who am I to argue?

53
00:05:40,104 --> 00:05:42,670
-Do you think that he'll be OK?

54
00:05:42,704 --> 00:05:43,637
-I don't know.

55
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,704
It's a fight between
two monsters.

56
00:05:45,737 --> 00:05:48,504
-Yeah, but I don't think
of him as a monster at all.

57
00:05:48,537 --> 00:05:49,737
He's different.

58
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:53,604
-Still, he's a bona fide
yokai, you can't deny that.

59
00:05:53,637 --> 00:05:56,837
-But if he goes out of
his way to protect humans,

60
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:01,704
doesn't that mean he must
have a heart like a human?

61
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:03,104
-Absolutely.

62
00:06:03,137 --> 00:06:05,737
We cannot rule out the existence
of yokai who have feelings like

63
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:08,437
humans do, and who
are our allies.

64
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:11,737
After all, not that long
ago, my own young life

65
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:14,237
was saved by a
yokai such as that.

66
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,870
-Oh yeah, that's
right, Kiyotsugu.

67
00:06:15,904 --> 00:06:17,337
-Though it's
doubtful you actually

68
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:19,537
saw yokai since you
were half asleep.

69
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:20,704
[grumble]

70
00:06:20,737 --> 00:06:23,837
-I'm sure you'll get
to see one some day.

71
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:26,270
-So I guess that means
that even among yokai,

72
00:06:26,304 --> 00:06:28,770
there are some monsters who have
lost their hearts and others

73
00:06:28,804 --> 00:06:31,270
who haven't.

74
00:06:31,304 --> 00:06:31,837
-That's right.

75
00:06:42,737 --> 00:06:44,670
-You're a stubborn one.

76
00:06:55,137 --> 00:06:56,304
-It's morning.

77
00:06:56,337 --> 00:06:57,237
-Not good.

78
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,770
Dawn is starting to break.

79
00:06:58,804 --> 00:07:01,070
-Master will be
at a disadvantage.

80
00:07:01,104 --> 00:07:02,270
-This is terrible.

81
00:07:02,304 --> 00:07:05,337
Once the sun rises, Master
Rikuo will transform.

82
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:07,304
-He'll revert back
into his Day form.

83
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:27,670
-Do not fear, Rikuo.

84
00:07:27,704 --> 00:07:30,670
There is a moon even
in broad daylight.

85
00:07:30,704 --> 00:07:32,404
It simply goes unnoticed.

86
00:07:32,437 --> 00:07:35,437
But the moon is
always in the sky,

87
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:39,004
and it always exists
deep inside of you.

88
00:07:49,504 --> 00:07:54,270
-If you can't dodge the next
one, the wound will be fatal.

89
00:07:54,304 --> 00:07:59,204
-Rikuo, after you defeated me,
you became the strongest yokai

90
00:07:59,237 --> 00:08:00,770
in the Nura Clan.

91
00:08:00,804 --> 00:08:03,137
Night and Day.

92
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:06,470
Embrace them both, and you will
become the Lord of Pandemonium.

93
00:08:11,604 --> 00:08:13,637
-I will not lose.

94
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:16,704
All my friends are
depending on me.

95
00:08:16,737 --> 00:08:20,604
-And these friends of yours,
are they human or yokai?

96
00:08:20,637 --> 00:08:21,437
Which are they?

97
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:28,804
Don't tell me you're going
to save both, aren't you?

98
00:08:28,837 --> 00:08:31,737
That silly idea of yours
is what makes you weak.

99
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:34,170
Well, I'll take those
friends of yours

100
00:08:34,204 --> 00:08:36,437
and make them part
of my Night Parade.

101
00:08:41,937 --> 00:08:42,704
-Damn it.

102
00:08:42,737 --> 00:08:44,604
What the hell's going on there?

103
00:08:44,637 --> 00:08:47,037
-Maybe we should
try and help him?

104
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:49,437
-Just how do you propose
we help Master Rikuo

105
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,837
without getting in the way?

106
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,604
-I hate to admit
it, but he's right.

107
00:08:52,637 --> 00:08:54,570
There's nothing much we
can do at this point.

108
00:09:02,004 --> 00:09:02,804
-Don't mess with me.

109
00:09:07,304 --> 00:09:09,404
-I saw cherry blossoms.

110
00:09:12,137 --> 00:09:13,337
-Really?

111
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:17,404
-Wait, I don't see anything
like that over there.

112
00:09:17,437 --> 00:09:19,837
-Master.

113
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:23,004
-Night or Day, it
doesn't matter.

114
00:09:23,037 --> 00:09:25,704
You and I are one.

115
00:09:25,737 --> 00:09:28,770
And we're going to protect
both humans and yokai, right?

116
00:09:28,804 --> 00:09:29,270
-Right.

117
00:09:41,237 --> 00:09:42,204
-Heh heh.

118
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:49,370
And now, Rikuo Nura,
this is the moment

119
00:09:49,404 --> 00:09:53,337
when you become part of my
Night Parade of 100 Demons.

120
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:54,337
Huh?

121
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:57,304
What-- what happened?

122
00:09:57,337 --> 00:10:02,637
-Don't you know, Tamazuki, about
the moon out in broad daylight?

123
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:05,104
-What?

124
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:07,037
-There's a moon in
the morning sky.

125
00:10:12,337 --> 00:10:14,270
-Where did you go?

126
00:10:14,304 --> 00:10:15,270
What's happening?

127
00:10:18,737 --> 00:10:20,370
-What is going on?

128
00:10:20,404 --> 00:10:21,470
-It's there.

129
00:10:21,504 --> 00:10:22,604
I can see it.

130
00:10:22,637 --> 00:10:26,704
-Yes, I can see clearly now too.

131
00:10:26,737 --> 00:10:30,904
-That is, without a doubt,
a flurry of cherry blossoms.

132
00:10:30,937 --> 00:10:34,637
-You know, I can feel my
blood starting to boil.

133
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:38,070
-Shut the hell up!

134
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:39,337
What?

135
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:45,504
I just cut you down, so how
can you still be standing?

136
00:10:45,537 --> 00:10:48,437
-Kyoka Suigetsu.

137
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:51,670
-Another one of
Nurarihyon's techniques.

138
00:10:51,704 --> 00:10:53,370
It doesn't matter.

139
00:10:53,404 --> 00:10:56,170
I am the one who
surpassed my father.

140
00:10:56,204 --> 00:10:57,604
Inugamigyoubu Tanuki!

141
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:07,637
-It's not your father
you need to surpass.

142
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:10,270
The only person you need to
overcome here is yourself.

143
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:19,037
[screaming]

144

-Tamazuki!

145
00:11:32,504 --> 00:11:36,604
-No, my hunter demons,
they're leaving me.

146
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:44,870
My powers are fading.

147
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:45,837
Stop!

148
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:46,337
Stop!

-It's all over.

00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:28,804
-Ah, just in time.

-Gramps?

154
00:12:30,637 --> 00:12:32,570
-Couldn't have cut
it much closer.

155
00:12:32,604 --> 00:12:35,970
-Master Rikuo.

156
00:12:36,004 --> 00:12:37,237
-Enough, Tamazuki.

157
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,770
Stop this immediately.

158
00:12:38,804 --> 00:12:40,137

[interposing voices]

00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:50,370
TAMAZUKI: I see.

162
00:12:50,404 --> 00:12:53,937
it-- it wasn't enough.

Only when I stand
atop the corpse

164
00:12:56,537 --> 00:13:00,570
of my weakening of a father,
will the Devil's Blade

165
00:13:00,604 --> 00:13:03,437
manifest its true power!

166
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:04,937
-What the--?

167
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:05,904
-Oh no.

168
00:13:13,637 --> 00:13:15,537
[gasp]

169
00:13:18,204 --> 00:13:20,737
RIKUO: Some yokai choose
to follow your Fear,

170
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:24,604
and yet you betrayed them.

171
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,370
You should at least take
care of ones who admire you.

172
00:13:37,637 --> 00:13:40,604
-That yokai.

173
00:13:40,637 --> 00:13:43,804
-He's huge.

174
00:13:43,837 --> 00:13:46,470
-You blithering idiot.

175
00:13:49,604 --> 00:13:53,037
You are such a foolish son.

176
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:56,104
-Please, father, put me down.

177
00:14:03,204 --> 00:14:09,670
-I beg you all,
please, forgive my son.

178
00:14:09,704 --> 00:14:14,070
He may have transgressed, but
he's still a dear son of mine.

179
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:17,037
I will see to it that he
makes amends for his behavior.

180
00:14:39,571 --> 00:14:40,960
[alarm clock]

181
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:45,027
RIKUO: Oh no, what time is it?

182
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:48,593
-Rikuo, are you awake?

183
00:14:48,627 --> 00:14:50,160
I'm coming in.

184
00:14:50,193 --> 00:14:52,160
Good morning.

185
00:14:52,193 --> 00:14:54,360
-Oh, morning, mom.

186
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,727
I overslept.

187
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,327
I have to get to school.

188
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,827
-Master.

189
00:14:58,860 --> 00:14:59,327
-Huh?

190
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,260
Yuki Onna.

191
00:15:00,293 --> 00:15:01,927
-It's Sunday morning.

192
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,427
There isn't any school
on the weekends.

193
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:07,693
Besides, you're in no
condition to go anywhere.

194
00:15:07,727 --> 00:15:09,827
-Oh yeah, I guess you're right.

195
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,860
-Do you realize you slept
for two straight days, Master

196
00:15:12,893 --> 00:15:14,160
Rikuo?

197
00:15:14,193 --> 00:15:16,293
-Good morning, Natto Kozo.

198
00:15:16,327 --> 00:15:18,493
-Well, according
to Zen, you should

199
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:21,027
be making a full
recovery in no time.

200
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,327
Oh, I'm not finished
doing the laundry.

201
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,493
Can you two look
after him for me?

202
00:15:25,527 --> 00:15:27,193
BOTH: OK.

203
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:28,693
-Master.

204
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:31,193
-Jeez, mom is so
energetic, isn't she?

205
00:15:31,227 --> 00:15:36,293
-Yes, and Lady Wakana's
smile is very reassuring too.

206
00:15:36,327 --> 00:15:38,993
Even that morning, when
she saw us in shambles,

207
00:15:39,027 --> 00:15:41,893
she greeted us all
with a warm smile.

208
00:15:41,927 --> 00:15:43,593
NATTO KOZO: Master,
the Supreme Commander

209
00:15:43,627 --> 00:15:45,660
asked if you would go
see him once you're awake

210
00:15:45,693 --> 00:15:46,760
and feel up to it.

211
00:15:46,793 --> 00:15:47,393
RIKUO: OK.

212
00:15:47,427 --> 00:15:48,660
I'll be right there.

213
00:15:48,693 --> 00:15:50,393
NATTO KOZO: Oh, but don't
force yourself to get up.

214
00:15:50,427 --> 00:15:52,260
RIKUO: It's better if
I move around a little.

215
00:15:52,293 --> 00:15:53,860
-Are you sure, Master?

216
00:15:53,893 --> 00:15:55,827
-You know, if you
worry too much,

217
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,393
your natto will spill out.

218
00:15:57,427 --> 00:15:57,893
-Uwah.

219
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:01,793
-So?

220
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:04,827
-Oh, uh, what do you mean?

221
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,593
-Well, there's Day
and Night Master,

222
00:16:06,627 --> 00:16:09,527
and the other Master
from that morning.

223
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,660
Who is the one that
you really like?

224
00:16:11,693 --> 00:16:12,793
-I don't understand.

225
00:16:12,827 --> 00:16:14,227
What are you trying to say?

226
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:17,060
-Oh my I can't believe
how much you're blushing.

227
00:16:17,093 --> 00:16:19,827
You have such a pure heart
for someone your age.

228
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:23,760
-You didn't have to add
"for someone your age."

229
00:16:23,793 --> 00:16:28,727
But yes, that morning, Master
Rikuo was absolutely divine.

230
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,427
-OK, OK, stop drooling.

231
00:16:40,627 --> 00:16:43,527
-That old coot Inugamigyoubu
Tanuki and his,

232
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,493
uh-- what was his
son's name again?

233
00:16:46,527 --> 00:16:47,593
-Tamazuki.

234
00:16:47,627 --> 00:16:51,093
-Oh yes, yes,
Tamazuki, that's right.

235
00:16:51,127 --> 00:16:54,560
It seems they returned
home to Shikoku safely.

236
00:16:54,593 --> 00:16:55,727
-I see.

237
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,093
-That old Tanuki.

238
00:16:57,127 --> 00:17:00,360
You know, he was prepared to
see his son died that day.

239
00:17:00,393 --> 00:17:01,993
In fact, he expected it.

240
00:17:05,127 --> 00:17:07,793
However, you put down your
sword without delivering

241
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:09,827
the finishing blow.

242
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:12,327
He told me he will never
forget the compassion

243
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,927
that you showed him.

244
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,727
And then he promised
he would do all

245
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,460
he could to instill that
same compassion in his son.

246
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,893
[slapping]

247
00:17:39,227 --> 00:17:40,560
[dog panting]

248
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:42,360
[barking]

249
00:17:50,193 --> 00:17:53,493
[barking]

250
00:17:53,527 --> 00:17:54,927
-Hm?

251
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,360
What are you doing?

252
00:17:56,393 --> 00:17:58,860
Are you planning on
following me around?

253
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:04,360
What an odd little fellow.

254
00:18:04,393 --> 00:18:07,527
I'm never going to
spoil you, you know?

255
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,993
[bark]

256
00:18:24,393 --> 00:18:27,227
-And so this incident has
been settled by Master Rikuo

257
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:30,127
while striking a bargain
with the Shikoku Yokai,

258
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,660
and is officially over.

259
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:32,560
-What's that?

260
00:18:32,593 --> 00:18:35,993
He struck a bargain?

261
00:18:36,027 --> 00:18:37,693
Shoei, what are you doing?

262
00:18:37,727 --> 00:18:38,527
SHOEI: Sit down.

263
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,660
You're in the way.

264
00:18:43,827 --> 00:18:45,293
-Hey there, Hitotsume.

265
00:18:45,327 --> 00:18:46,660
-Uh, hi.

266
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,593
-OK, thanks for waiting.

267
00:18:58,627 --> 00:19:02,693
-We have all looked forward to
seeing you, Supreme Commander

268
00:19:02,727 --> 00:19:04,827
and Master Rikuo.

269
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,627
-Welcome home, Master.

270
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,460
-Yes, welcome home, Master.

271
00:19:08,493 --> 00:19:10,793
-Welcome home, Master.

272
00:19:10,827 --> 00:19:12,660
-Welcome home, Master.

273
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:13,593
RIKUO: Thank you.

274
00:19:13,627 --> 00:19:15,127
Thank you very much, everyone.

275
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:22,560
-A toast to the debut of
Master Rikuo's own Night Parade

276
00:19:22,593 --> 00:19:24,493
and the prosperity
of the Nura Clan.

277
00:19:27,193 --> 00:19:29,560
Huh?

278
00:19:29,593 --> 00:19:32,160
Hm.

279
00:19:32,193 --> 00:19:32,860
Cheers!

280
00:19:32,893 --> 00:19:33,360
ALL: Cheers!

281
00:19:37,693 --> 00:19:39,160
-Here you go, Yuki.

282
00:19:39,193 --> 00:19:41,293
Drink up.

283
00:19:41,327 --> 00:19:46,160
You know, whenever I'm
at a critical point,

284
00:19:46,193 --> 00:19:49,093
I like to think back to the time
when I fought against at Mt.

285
00:19:49,127 --> 00:19:50,293
Nejireme.

286
00:19:50,327 --> 00:19:52,960
GYUKI: You had reached a
measure of self-realization

287
00:19:52,993 --> 00:19:56,960
even before that time.

288
00:19:56,993 --> 00:20:00,693
You just hadn't accepted it yet.

289
00:20:00,727 --> 00:20:02,027
RIKUO: You're right.

290
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:05,293
I know now that
I'm always myself,

291
00:20:05,327 --> 00:20:07,460
whether it's night or day.

292
00:20:07,493 --> 00:20:11,360
-Yes, that you are.

293
00:20:11,393 --> 00:20:15,960
You have both sides in you,
which is why you're strong.

294
00:20:15,993 --> 00:20:19,060
-I really feel like dancing now.

295
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:20,127
-Now you're talking.

296
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,893
Let's see some of your moves.

297
00:20:21,927 --> 00:20:25,827
-Well then, I think
I'm going to dance too.

298
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,993
-Go for it, Rikuo.

299
00:20:30,827 --> 00:20:33,627
-Heh, it always
ends up like this.

300
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,127
These guys are so lame.

301
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,093
-You say that, but I'll bet
you're itching to join in,

302
00:20:38,127 --> 00:20:39,160
are you, Gozu?

303
00:20:39,193 --> 00:20:41,293
-Don't be ridiculous.

304
00:20:41,327 --> 00:20:41,793
-Ow.

305
00:20:50,411 --> 00:20:53,111
-Well, you two, it seems your
wounds have all healed up.

306
00:20:53,144 --> 00:20:55,511
-It's only going to get
tougher for the Nura Clan.

307
00:20:55,544 --> 00:20:59,777
Without a doubt, your strength
will become essential to us.

308
00:20:59,811 --> 00:21:01,044
-We're counting on you.

309
00:21:01,077 --> 00:21:03,944
-Hmph.

310
00:21:03,977 --> 00:21:05,344
-Hmph.

311
00:21:05,377 --> 00:21:07,577
-And at that moment, in order to
protect the Supreme Commander,

312
00:21:07,611 --> 00:21:10,777
I caught one Shikoku
yokai after another,

313
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:12,644
tearing them up
and tossing them--

314
00:21:12,677 --> 00:21:14,811
-All right, everyone,
time to go inside and eat.

315
00:21:14,844 --> 00:21:16,177
ALL: OK.

316
00:21:16,211 --> 00:21:17,444
-Huh?

317
00:21:17,477 --> 00:21:19,744
-I thought it would be
much wiser to send them

318
00:21:19,777 --> 00:21:22,877
to the dojo instead of
letting them wander.

319
00:21:22,911 --> 00:21:23,677
Oh.

320
00:21:23,711 --> 00:21:26,011
-Great, why today of all days?

321
00:21:32,177 --> 00:21:33,044
-Yoo hoo.

322
00:21:33,077 --> 00:21:34,077
-Hi, Nura.

323
00:21:34,111 --> 00:21:35,744
-We came by for a visit.

324
00:21:35,777 --> 00:21:38,477
-It seems very lively
at your house today.

325
00:21:38,511 --> 00:21:42,377
-Uh, yeah, some of my
relatives are over.

326
00:21:42,411 --> 00:21:47,011
-As usual, this place
reeks with yokai aura.

327
00:21:47,044 --> 00:21:48,944
-Your relatives?

328
00:21:48,977 --> 00:21:51,811
-Ah.

329
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:54,111
-Wha--?

330
00:21:54,144 --> 00:21:54,644
-Huh?

331
00:21:54,677 --> 00:21:55,411
What is it?

332
00:21:55,444 --> 00:21:57,644
What's the matter, Shima?

333
00:21:57,677 --> 00:21:58,144
Hm?

334
00:22:01,977 --> 00:22:02,777
-It's nothing.

335
00:22:09,211 --> 00:22:10,144
-Hm?

336
00:22:10,177 --> 00:22:11,144
-Huh?

337
00:22:11,177 --> 00:22:12,644
-What?

338
00:22:12,677 --> 00:22:15,944
-Rikuo, I'm curious, are you--?

339
00:22:15,977 --> 00:22:17,344
YURA (VOICEOVER): What?

340
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:19,777
Is Ienaga going to kiss him in
front of everyone this time?

341
00:22:24,277 --> 00:22:27,611
-You do, you look
like him a little.

342
00:22:27,644 --> 00:22:28,977
Sort of.

343
00:22:29,011 --> 00:22:31,477
-Like who?

344
00:22:31,511 --> 00:22:31,977
-Hm.

345
00:23:01,777 --> 00:23:05,077
NARRATOR: Rikuo Nura, the
young master of the Nura Clan

346
00:23:05,111 --> 00:23:09,411
that claims 10,000 yokai
followers across the country.

347
00:23:09,444 --> 00:23:12,644
The day he will take over
as the Third Heir may not

348
00:23:12,677 --> 00:23:13,644
be so far away.

349
00:23:49,377 --> 00:23:51,977
NARRATOR: Tamazuki's ambition
is brought to an end.

350
00:23:52,011 --> 00:23:55,111
Some of the yokai returned
home, while many others

351
00:23:55,144 --> 00:23:57,077
returned to the heavens.

352
00:23:57,111 --> 00:23:58,844
As for Rikuo--

353
00:23:58,877 --> 00:24:02,611
