NIGHT RIKUO: Tell me
what's on your mind, Gyuki.

12
00:02:45,746 --> 00:02:47,412
-So you've come after all.

13
00:02:51,912 --> 00:02:53,079
I see.

14
00:02:53,112 --> 00:02:56,079
It seems you really do have
the Supreme Commander's

15
00:02:56,112 --> 00:02:57,712
blood in you.

16

To appear wherever
you like so elusively.

00:03:02,946 --> 00:03:04,079
-Elusively, huh?

18
00:03:06,779 --> 00:03:09,812
Now answer me, Gyuki.

19
00:03:09,846 --> 00:03:11,579
Why?

20
00:03:11,612 --> 00:03:17,912
Why would you be so foolish
as to try and kill me?

21
00:03:17,946 --> 00:03:21,912
You're known for making very
careful but wise decisions.

22
00:03:21,946 --> 00:03:23,346
So why?

23
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:26,646
Were you the one pulling the
strings behind the Kyosu Clan?

24
00:03:29,779 --> 00:03:31,846
-When morning comes
again to the mountain,

25
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:35,779
will you go back to your
weak and fragile human form

26
00:03:35,812 --> 00:03:39,746
and forget everything
while you were a yokai?

27
00:03:39,779 --> 00:03:42,546
If the day does not
recognize your yokai form,

28
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:47,679
are you one person by
day and another by night?

29
00:03:47,712 --> 00:03:49,512
-Perhaps.

30
00:03:49,546 --> 00:03:53,412
Why is it you're so
concerned about me?

31
00:03:53,446 --> 00:03:53,912
-Fool.

32
00:04:08,912 --> 00:04:13,012
-My resolve has
remained the same

33
00:04:13,046 --> 00:04:15,312
since my blood
awakened that day.

34
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:26,746
I will become the third heir
and rule over all yokai.

35
00:04:33,446 --> 00:04:37,146
If I felt like it, I could
easily cut off your head.

36
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:55,879
-You would be wise to
answer my questions, Rikuo.

37
00:04:55,912 --> 00:04:58,579
And answer each one
of them clearly.

38
00:04:58,612 --> 00:05:01,346
If I'm not satisfied
with any of your answers,

39
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:03,646
I'll cut off your ears and arms.

40
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:05,746
You see, you're not
the only one here

41
00:05:05,779 --> 00:05:08,112
who is capable of cutting
off heads if he chooses.

-Did you transform on a whim?

Remember that time
when you killed me too.

45

-Were you aware that the Nura
Clan has weakened considerably

46

since the death of
the second heir?

47
00:05:30,512 --> 00:05:32,879
-Do you have any
intention of taking over?

48
00:05:32,912 --> 00:05:35,112
Answer me now.

49
00:05:35,146 --> 00:05:37,512
-This world has lost
all sense of order.

50
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:40,179
Are you willing to do what
it takes to restore it?

51
00:05:40,212 --> 00:05:41,146
-I want to know.

52
00:05:44,112 --> 00:05:46,012
-Rikuo, answer me.

53
00:05:56,212 --> 00:06:01,179
-Gyuki, what are you planning
to do after you kill me?

54
00:06:01,212 --> 00:06:06,479
-I will kill you, and
then I will die as well.

55
00:06:18,112 --> 00:06:21,279
I have heard that there was a
time when the capital, rather

56
00:06:21,312 --> 00:06:24,646
this entire country, was struck
by frequent natural disasters

57
00:06:24,679 --> 00:06:28,246
and war, and thus was
severely impoverished.

58
00:06:40,012 --> 00:06:40,746
-Look.

59
00:06:40,779 --> 00:06:42,646
Rain has started to fall.

60
00:06:42,679 --> 00:06:44,412
-The rain is a blessing.

61
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:44,912
-Yes.

62
00:06:49,712 --> 00:06:53,446
-The Hiyoshi Gongen shrine is
known for bringing miracles.

63
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:55,646
I'm sure it'll
grant us our wish.

64
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:03,746
GYUKI: Yoshidano Shosho Korefusa
was a high ranking noble,

65
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:06,412
and he had a wife named Hanako.

66
00:07:06,446 --> 00:07:09,079
Hanako had been unable
to conceive a child,

67
00:07:09,112 --> 00:07:10,779
so they set out for
the Hiyoshi Gongen

68
00:07:10,812 --> 00:07:14,179
shrine in the province of
Omi to pray for a blessing.

69
00:07:27,946 --> 00:07:33,212
However, to their dismay,
she remained barren.

70
00:07:33,246 --> 00:07:33,712
Then--

71
00:08:01,812 --> 00:08:04,446
-It was such a strange dream.

72
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,246
But just then, I was
surrounded by a wonderful scent

73
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:09,046
of freshly picked plums.

74
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:11,579
-A scent of plums?

75
00:08:11,612 --> 00:08:14,679
I think that this
must bode well for us.

76
00:08:14,712 --> 00:08:15,546
-I agree.

77
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:16,546
I was thinking that too.

78
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:25,546
GYUKI: The following spring
when the plum blossoms were

79
00:08:25,579 --> 00:08:30,312
in full bloom, a
baby boy was born.

80
00:08:30,346 --> 00:08:32,112
They named him--

81
00:08:32,146 --> 00:08:33,912
-I have decided on Umewakamaru.

82
00:09:17,912 --> 00:09:21,379
-Umewaka, let us get going.

83
00:09:21,412 --> 00:09:24,412
GYUKI: When Umewakamaru
was seven years old,

84
00:09:24,446 --> 00:09:27,112
his father Yoshidano
Shosho Korefusa

85
00:09:27,146 --> 00:09:29,546
was known as a
just man but became

86
00:09:29,579 --> 00:09:31,346
embroiled in political strife.

87
00:09:31,379 --> 00:09:33,912
Officially, his
death was said to be

88
00:09:33,946 --> 00:09:35,379
caused by a grave illness.

89
00:09:45,246 --> 00:09:46,546
-Mother, are you crying?

90
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,679
Mother?

91
00:09:51,712 --> 00:09:53,679
-What is wrong, Umewaka?

92
00:09:53,712 --> 00:09:55,512
Are you not able to sleep?

93
00:09:55,546 --> 00:09:57,912
-Mother, do not worry.

94
00:09:57,946 --> 00:09:59,846
I will devote myself
to knowledge and train

95
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:01,746
in the way of the
sword, and I promise

96
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:04,446
I will always protect
you in father's place.

97
00:10:08,379 --> 00:10:10,479
Mother, you are hurting me.

98
00:10:10,512 --> 00:10:13,412
I can barely breathe.

99
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,412
GYUKI: Umewakamaru
was sent off to pray

100
00:10:15,446 --> 00:10:17,212
for his father's repose.

101
00:10:17,246 --> 00:10:19,546
But the truth was
that his mother

102
00:10:19,579 --> 00:10:22,412
was remarrying in
order to survive.

103
00:10:22,446 --> 00:10:26,012
Thus, Umewakamaru entered
the monastery at Mount Hiei.

104
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:32,312
-Father, Mother.

105
00:10:32,346 --> 00:10:35,412
GYUKI: Time passed,
and as it did,

106
00:10:35,446 --> 00:10:38,512
Umewakamaru matured
into a fine prodigy,

107
00:10:38,546 --> 00:10:41,512
acknowledged by everyone
as a talented youth.

108
00:10:51,812 --> 00:10:54,179
News of his mother's
illness was devastating

109
00:10:54,212 --> 00:10:57,679
to the 12-year-old Umewakamaru.

110
00:10:57,712 --> 00:11:00,346
His desire to see his
mother was so strong

111
00:11:00,379 --> 00:11:03,012
that he was willing to abandon
his studies and his future.

112
00:12:04,352 --> 00:12:05,785
-Pardon me.

113
00:12:05,818 --> 00:12:06,818
Pardon me.

Young man.

115
00:12:14,418 --> 00:12:17,852
Sorry to wake you, but is
your name is Umewakamaru?

116
00:12:17,885 --> 00:12:20,918
GYUKI: The two claimed to have
served Hanako since shortly

117
00:12:20,952 --> 00:12:24,385
after Umewakamaru was sent away.

118
00:12:24,418 --> 00:12:25,752
And--

119
00:12:25,785 --> 00:12:27,918
-Your mother is recuperating
at the residence that

120
00:12:27,952 --> 00:12:30,252
is up the road not
too far from here.

121
00:12:30,285 --> 00:12:31,918
-In spite of her
terrible illness,

122
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:34,252
she has been longing
to see you again.

123
00:12:34,285 --> 00:12:35,752
-Mother is nearby?

124
00:12:35,785 --> 00:12:37,085
-Yes, sir.

125
00:12:37,118 --> 00:12:39,618
She is staying in a mansion
about half way up a mountain

126
00:12:39,652 --> 00:12:42,218
called Mount Nejireme.

127
00:12:42,252 --> 00:12:43,318
-Mount Nejireme.

128
00:12:43,352 --> 00:12:45,185
Let us go there now.

129
00:12:45,218 --> 00:12:47,885
-I know that your mother
will be so surprised.

130
00:12:47,918 --> 00:12:48,618
-She will.

131
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:08,818
-Ladies, how much
longer until we arrive?

132
00:13:14,285 --> 00:13:19,152

to deceive an innocent youth.

-That won't be any use to you.

137
00:13:38,552 --> 00:13:42,552
-Umewakamaru's first
thought was I want to live.

138
00:13:42,585 --> 00:13:45,718
I have to live until I can
see my mother one more time.

-Your mother, how
very interesting.

142
00:13:57,152 --> 00:13:59,518
Could this be who
you're looking for?

143
00:14:07,885 --> 00:14:15,285
You know, noble folk
are so very, very tasty.

144
00:14:15,318 --> 00:14:17,718
GYUKI: The sword that held so
many memories of his father

145
00:14:17,752 --> 00:14:21,252
was useless, and he could
only stand there helpless

146
00:14:21,285 --> 00:14:23,918
as his beloved mother
was devoured by a yokai.

-Lord Gyuki, are you all right?

148
00:15:05,718 --> 00:15:07,552
-I curse all the gods.

149
00:15:07,585 --> 00:15:09,318
I curse the Buddha.

150
00:15:09,352 --> 00:15:13,185
I curse the world that stole
my mother and father from me.

151
00:15:13,218 --> 00:15:18,685
And I swear that from this day
forward, I will become a demon

152
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:22,118
and mourn my parents
by devouring humans.

153
00:15:22,152 --> 00:15:24,018
-Oh please, please spare us.

154
00:15:24,052 --> 00:15:25,485
We did not want to do it.

155
00:15:25,518 --> 00:15:27,585
We were forced by Gyuki
to lure travelers to him.

156
00:15:27,618 --> 00:15:29,152
He said he would
kill us if we didn't.

157
00:15:29,185 --> 00:15:31,818
-We are so grateful you
have exterminated Gyuki.

Thank you, my lord.

159
00:15:33,852 --> 00:15:36,185
-No need for
gratitude because you

will offer your
own precious lives

00:15:38,052 --> 00:15:41,218
in memory of my murdered mother.

162
00:15:41,252 --> 00:15:43,718
[screams]

163
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:55,085
GYUKI: Mourning his
mother, Umewakamaru

164
00:15:55,118 --> 00:15:58,318
attacked humans again and again.

165
00:15:58,352 --> 00:16:01,552
He recruited yokai from
the area to join him

166
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:07,718
and continued his bloody rampage
until he became known as Gyuki.

167
00:16:07,752 --> 00:16:10,985
Several decades,
several centuries

168
00:16:11,018 --> 00:16:15,218
passed, by then,
Umewakamaru, rather Gyuki,

169
00:16:15,252 --> 00:16:18,752
had long forgotten about
the love from his parents.

170
00:16:18,785 --> 00:16:21,818
That is when he
finally appeared.

171
00:16:53,585 --> 00:16:56,585
-So is that Gyuki's
mansion up ahead?

172
00:16:56,618 --> 00:16:57,085
-Yes.

173
00:17:30,752 --> 00:17:31,718
-Supreme Commander.

174
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:07,852
-You must be Gyuki.

175
00:18:07,885 --> 00:18:10,885
-There's no need to tell you my
name when you're about to die.

176
00:18:10,918 --> 00:18:12,352
-Interesting.

177
00:18:12,385 --> 00:18:13,552
No one is to interfere.

178
00:18:13,585 --> 00:18:17,352
This one's my prey.

179
00:18:17,385 --> 00:18:17,852
Huh?

180
00:18:24,718 --> 00:18:27,652
GYUKI: The battle raged on for
three days and three nights.

181
00:18:43,618 --> 00:18:48,785
And I was trounced, defeated
utterly, humiliated.

182
00:18:48,818 --> 00:18:52,618
As the leader of the vanquished,
I was prepared to be executed.

183
00:18:59,018 --> 00:19:00,052
-I must say.

184
00:19:00,085 --> 00:19:01,685
You're very strong.

185
00:19:01,718 --> 00:19:05,118
The rumors were right about
your strength and talent.

186
00:19:05,152 --> 00:19:07,585
Why don't you consider
joining my clan?

187
00:19:07,618 --> 00:19:08,385
How about it?

188
00:19:17,218 --> 00:19:19,752
Perhaps, you can't make
up your mind just yet.

189
00:19:19,785 --> 00:19:21,385
I'll give you two days.

190
00:19:21,418 --> 00:19:23,518
Come see me before
the two days are up.

191
00:19:32,085 --> 00:19:33,052
GYUKI: Two days passed.

192
00:19:39,485 --> 00:19:42,418
[carousing voices]

193
00:19:53,218 --> 00:19:56,585
[hushed whispers]

194
00:20:17,452 --> 00:20:20,185
-I won't allow you to come
any closer to the Supreme

195
00:20:20,218 --> 00:20:21,518
Commander.

196
00:20:21,552 --> 00:20:22,085
-Don't worry.

197
00:20:22,118 --> 00:20:22,952
It's all right.

198
00:20:22,985 --> 00:20:24,518
-But Supreme Commander.

199
00:20:29,518 --> 00:20:30,418
-Supreme Commander?

200
00:20:47,085 --> 00:20:47,952
-You've come at last.

201
00:20:47,985 --> 00:20:49,018
I've been waiting for you.

202
00:21:09,718 --> 00:21:11,185
-I swear my loyalty.

203
00:21:14,185 --> 00:21:16,718
The entire time
he was testing me.

204
00:21:16,752 --> 00:21:20,252
He threw himself
at me and beat me.

205
00:21:20,285 --> 00:21:23,552
And then, acknowledged me.

206
00:21:23,585 --> 00:21:24,952
I completely lost to him.

207
00:21:41,618 --> 00:21:45,185
For as long as I live,
I'll never forget the words

208
00:21:45,218 --> 00:21:48,352
Lord Nurarihyon said
to me that night.

209
00:21:48,385 --> 00:21:48,852
Never.

210
00:22:08,218 --> 00:22:11,651
[theme music]

211
00:23:39,521 --> 00:23:41,255
RIKUO: Hey, Night
Rikuo, how old are you?

212
00:23:41,288 --> 00:23:43,155
NIGHT RIKUO: Yokai aren't
concerned with age?

213
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:45,521
RIKUO: But someday, we'll
also become old like Grandpa.

214
00:23:45,555 --> 00:23:46,888
NIGHT RIKUO: Don't
ever say that.

215
00:23:46,921 --> 00:23:48,421
RIKUO: So you do care.

216
00:23:48,455 --> 00:23:51,555
NIGHT RIKUO: Next time,
"Gyuki's Beloved Nura Clan."
