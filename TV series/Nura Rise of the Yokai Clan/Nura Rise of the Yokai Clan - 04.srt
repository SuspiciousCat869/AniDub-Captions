as the Supreme
Commander of the yokai.

00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,033
They had another name
for him, the Lord

-Damn that girl.

12
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:17,656
She's pretty strong.

13
00:02:19,971 --> 00:02:22,738
NARRATOR: The onmyigo
girl is on a mission.

14
00:02:22,771 --> 00:02:24,471
Her skills will
vanquish the ayakashi.

15
00:02:35,705 --> 00:02:38,438
-That's a good boy, Tanro.

16
00:02:38,471 --> 00:02:40,638
-Hey, Kyuso, who is this girl?

17
00:02:40,671 --> 00:02:43,071
-Yeah.

18
00:02:43,105 --> 00:02:47,338
-Kyuso, giant rat
yokai that devour cats.

19
00:02:47,371 --> 00:02:50,938
I never expected one to
disguise itself as a person.

20
00:02:55,271 --> 00:02:59,138
-I never expected him
to befriend an onmyogi.

The third heir has an
interesting taste in girls,

doesn't he?

23
00:03:08,705 --> 00:03:11,205
Why don't you put away
that dangerous toy?

24
00:03:16,038 --> 00:03:17,871
-Don't touch me, you rat.

25
00:03:21,438 --> 00:03:24,105
-Well, you may be
a skilled onmyogi,

26
00:03:24,138 --> 00:03:28,038
but you're still just
a young little child.

Help me.

-Stop it now.

31
00:03:36,305 --> 00:03:39,671
She has nothing to do with this.

32
00:03:39,705 --> 00:03:42,205
-Seems you were so
distracted by my good looks

33
00:03:42,238 --> 00:03:45,938
that you forgot all about
your little friend over there.

34
00:03:45,971 --> 00:03:48,805
Ah, but there's really no
need to be embarrassed.

35
00:03:48,838 --> 00:03:50,405
You just couldn't help yourself.

-No.

37
00:03:54,538 --> 00:03:57,705

that shikigama of yours away?

00:04:36,171 --> 00:04:38,038
-Thank you for the
help, Yuki Onna.

42

-This is nothing, Lady Wakana.

You know I'm always happy
to help you out with stuff.

-What's wrong, Kubinashi?

45
00:04:51,738 --> 00:04:55,738
-That sewer rat earlier,
he's from the Kyuso Clan.

-Indeed.

47
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:59,905
And speaking of the
Kyuso Clan, they've

48
00:04:59,938 --> 00:05:02,738
seized control of First
Street from the Bakeneko Clan

49
00:05:02,771 --> 00:05:06,371
and are causing trouble there.

50
00:05:06,405 --> 00:05:11,338
Kubinashi, have you heard
from Ryota Neko, head

51
00:05:11,371 --> 00:05:12,605
of the Bakeneko Clan?

52
00:05:17,571 --> 00:05:21,238
-Hey, were you talking
about Ryota Neko?

53
00:05:21,271 --> 00:05:22,638
-Yeah.

54
00:05:22,671 --> 00:05:26,905
You see he's one of Kubinashi's
oldest friends, so I thought--

55
00:05:26,938 --> 00:05:30,338
-The Bakeneko Clan have always
been gamblers, but not the best

56
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:31,471
fighters.

57
00:05:31,505 --> 00:05:33,771
I'm not surprised they
lost to the Kyuso Clan.

58
00:05:33,805 --> 00:05:35,471
-Neither am I.

-What's with this?

00:06:10,538 --> 00:06:11,605
-Boss, go.

64
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:12,838
I'll handle these rats.

65
00:06:12,871 --> 00:06:13,905
Get out of here.

-I'm sorry.

00:06:57,838 --> 00:06:58,971
-What?

71
00:06:59,005 --> 00:07:02,138
Not another rat.

72
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:04,671
-Are you Master Rikuo?

73
00:07:04,705 --> 00:07:05,905
-Oh good.

74
00:07:05,938 --> 00:07:09,138
It looks like you're
friendlier than the last one.

75
00:07:09,171 --> 00:07:11,138
-How do you do, Master Rikuo?

76
00:07:11,171 --> 00:07:15,171
I am a rat who runs errands
on behalf of Kyuso Clan.

77
00:07:15,205 --> 00:07:16,871
-The Kyuso Clan?

78
00:07:16,905 --> 00:07:20,038
-Yes, we are a group
of petty yokai rats

00:07:20,071 --> 00:07:22,305
who live on Ukiyoe
Town's First Street.

-So what business does a
rat like you have with me?

81
00:07:25,905 --> 00:07:29,605
-I've come to inform you of
something that's happened.

82
00:07:29,638 --> 00:07:33,838
I witnessed two of your friends,
Yura Keikain and Kana Ienaga,

83
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:36,405
being abducted by a group
of dangerous criminals.

84
00:07:36,438 --> 00:07:37,305
-What?

85
00:07:37,338 --> 00:07:38,705
Abducted?

86
00:07:38,738 --> 00:07:40,338
You sure about this?

87
00:07:40,371 --> 00:07:40,905
-Yes.

88
00:07:40,938 --> 00:07:42,838
I'm positive.

89
00:07:42,871 --> 00:07:46,071
They were kidnapped
off the street.

This is terrible.

Thank you for coming
here and telling me.

-No, Master Rikuo.

94
00:07:52,971 --> 00:07:55,405
Miss Keikain is an onmyigo.

95
00:07:55,438 --> 00:08:00,038
You can't ask everyone in your
clan to help you save her.

96
00:08:00,071 --> 00:08:01,738
-That's true.

97
00:08:01,771 --> 00:08:02,971
But still--

98
00:08:03,005 --> 00:08:04,305
-It'll be all right.

99
00:08:04,338 --> 00:08:07,038
If something happens, my clan
will be there to help you.

Please, you need
to go by yourself.

-OK.

102
00:08:11,838 --> 00:08:12,805
Let's go.

103
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:20,171
-Where's he going?

104
00:08:38,938 --> 00:08:43,105
The master will get mad if
he finds out I followed him.

105
00:08:43,138 --> 00:08:46,238
That place definitely
smells like bad news.

RIKUO (VOICEOVER): Kana,
Miss Keikain, hold on.

I'll save you.

108
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,799
-How do you do, Master Rikuo?

109
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:15,966
I'm Kyuso, and I'm the head
of the Kyuso Clan of yokai.

110
00:09:15,999 --> 00:09:17,533
It's a pleasure to meet you.

111
00:09:17,566 --> 00:09:21,033
Welcome to our place.

112
00:09:21,066 --> 00:09:22,366
-You tricked me.

113
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,499
-Sorry.

114
00:09:23,533 --> 00:09:25,233
I told my men to give
you a proper welcome,

115
00:09:25,266 --> 00:09:27,766
but they misunderstood.

116
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:31,866
No matter how useless
and cowardly you may be,

117
00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:36,366
you're still, after all, the
third heir of the Nura Clan.

118
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,933
-Let the girls go.

119
00:09:38,966 --> 00:09:42,266
-The emblem of the
Nura Clan no longer

120
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:46,699
has the power to satisfy
the desires of our clan.

121
00:09:46,733 --> 00:09:51,199
No one cares about honor
or about loyalties anymore.

122
00:09:51,233 --> 00:09:54,166
Those are all
things of the past.

123
00:09:54,199 --> 00:09:55,066
Do you understand?

124
00:10:02,533 --> 00:10:03,366
RIKUO: Kana!

125
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:04,299
Miss Keikain.

126
00:10:10,233 --> 00:10:13,099
-I do this for the
sake of your clan.

127
00:10:13,133 --> 00:10:16,666
Your clan won't be able to
survive with the old school

128
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,966
yokai you lead.

129
00:10:18,999 --> 00:10:24,599
I want you to announce that you
will not become the third heir.

130
00:10:24,633 --> 00:10:26,066
-OK.

131
00:10:26,099 --> 00:10:29,366
You'll let the girls
go if I do, right?

132
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:32,133
-By tonight, I want you
to notify all clan leaders

133
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:34,433
in the country of your decision.

134
00:10:34,466 --> 00:10:38,099
And if you fail at completing
what I've just asked of you,

135
00:10:38,133 --> 00:10:42,266
I will kill both of these
girls at the very first light

136
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:42,933
of dawn.

137
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:54,666
-You OK?

138
00:10:54,699 --> 00:10:57,299
Looks like you're hurt.

139
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:59,699
-Master Rikuo, I'm so sorry.

140
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:08,933
My name is Ryota Neko, the
head of the Bakeneko clan.

141
00:11:08,966 --> 00:11:12,699
I was left in charge of First
Street by your grandfather.

142
00:11:12,733 --> 00:11:13,333
-Listen.

143
00:11:13,366 --> 00:11:14,499
You're hurt.

144
00:11:14,533 --> 00:11:16,599
Just try and take it easy, OK.

145
00:11:26,233 --> 00:11:29,033
-Master Rikuo, I
know the things we do

146
00:11:29,066 --> 00:11:34,533
must look terrible to
you, but we do have rules.

147
00:11:34,566 --> 00:11:38,666
We've been very careful not to
take the name of the Nura Clan.

148
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:41,333
-Hey, someone come
out here and help.

149
00:11:41,366 --> 00:11:43,099
-But they're different.

150
00:11:46,299 --> 00:11:47,733
-Master!

151
00:11:47,766 --> 00:11:48,366
-Ryota Neko.

152
00:11:52,433 --> 00:11:54,833
-What a waste.

153
00:11:54,866 --> 00:11:57,466
I mean you're not really going
to return these kittens to him,

154
00:11:57,499 --> 00:11:57,966
are you?

155
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:06,399
-Don't ask me stupid questions.

156
00:12:06,433 --> 00:12:11,033
These beauties are
too good to let go.

157
00:12:11,066 --> 00:12:12,299
Don't worry.

158
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:15,933
We're all going to have
plenty of fun with these two.

159

-[whimpering] This is bad.

160
00:12:20,733 --> 00:12:22,133
-Ah.

161
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:26,299
Onmyogi girl,
finally awake, I see.

162
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,733
-Ienaga.

00:12:28,766 --> 00:12:31,166
I told you she has
nothing to do with this.

164
00:12:31,199 --> 00:12:32,633
Just let her go.

165
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:36,099
-You still don't
understand, do you?

166
00:12:36,133 --> 00:12:39,666
I'm going to teach you that
without your shikigami,

167
00:12:39,699 --> 00:12:41,566
you're just an ordinary girl.

168
00:12:44,466 --> 00:12:47,530
No one's going to
come to your rescue.

169
00:12:52,299 --> 00:12:55,533
KARASU: Master Rikuo, what
is the meaning of this?

170
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:57,499
-It's exactly what you see.

171
00:12:57,533 --> 00:13:00,633
Karasu Tengo, I want you
to send these letters out

172
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:03,266
to every clan leader across
the country right now.

173
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:06,666
If you don't, Kana and Miss
Keikain will be killed.

174
00:13:06,699 --> 00:13:07,166
KARASU: No.

175
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,499
I can't.

176
00:13:08,533 --> 00:13:09,466
Don't do this, master.

177
00:13:09,499 --> 00:13:10,666
You must reconsider.

178
00:13:10,699 --> 00:13:12,666
An official letter
like this is as

179
00:13:12,699 --> 00:13:15,266
absolute as a letter
of excommunication.

180
00:13:15,299 --> 00:13:16,633
-I know that.

181
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:20,366
But in order to save them, this
is something I've got to do.

182
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:20,866
Grandpa.

183
00:13:25,466 --> 00:13:28,133
There's nothing you
can do to stop me,

184
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:30,833
because I've got to save them.

185
00:13:30,866 --> 00:13:33,166
NURARIHYON: The Kyuso Clan, huh?

186
00:13:33,199 --> 00:13:33,666
-Wait.

187
00:13:33,699 --> 00:13:34,733
You knew?

188
00:13:34,766 --> 00:13:36,866
You knew about them, and
yet you ignored this.

189
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,833
Grandpa!

190
00:13:38,866 --> 00:13:40,166
-Well, let's see now.

191
00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:42,666
If I'm not mistaken,
they were some trash,

192
00:13:42,699 --> 00:13:45,533
I removed from the clan.

193
00:13:45,566 --> 00:13:46,233
RIKUO: Dammit.

194
00:13:46,266 --> 00:13:47,399
I hate yokai.

195
00:13:47,433 --> 00:13:48,233
You're all the same.

196
00:13:51,366 --> 00:13:51,933
[whimper]

197
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:59,166
-Rikuo, it's your
responsibility to settle

198
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,966
what happened between
you and the Kyuso Clan.

199
00:14:01,999 --> 00:14:05,166
You do know that, right?

200
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:05,733
-Yes.

201
00:14:05,766 --> 00:14:07,199
I know.

202
00:14:07,233 --> 00:14:08,966
-You won't regret this.

203
00:14:12,099 --> 00:14:14,133
-I don't have any kind of power.

204
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:16,399
This is all I can do.

205
00:14:16,433 --> 00:14:17,833
I have no choice.

206
00:14:17,866 --> 00:14:20,133
RYOTA: Master, you mustn't.

207
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:21,533
-You shouldn't be moving.

208
00:14:21,566 --> 00:14:25,333
-Besides, the Kyuso Clan never
keeps their promises to anyone.

209
00:14:25,366 --> 00:14:26,633
-Ryota Neko.

210
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:33,466
-Supreme Commander,
I'm sorry, but it

211
00:14:33,499 --> 00:14:37,133
was my cowardice that caused
this whole mess to begin with.

212
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:43,166
I swear to you now that will
bring an end to what I started.

213
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,499
-Ryota Neko.

214
00:14:46,533 --> 00:14:47,433
Stop.

215
00:14:47,466 --> 00:14:48,766
What can you do
in your condition?

216
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:55,733
-Master, there are
times in life when

217
00:14:55,766 --> 00:14:58,299
a yokai must stand and
fight even though he

218
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:00,099
knows he will lose the battle.

219
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:00,933
RIKUO: Ryota Neko.

220
00:15:09,266 --> 00:15:10,366
-Kubinashi.

221
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,199
-This will be our first
fight together in ages.

222
00:15:13,233 --> 00:15:14,566
Show a little spirit.

223
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,233
[heartbeat]

224
00:15:26,266 --> 00:15:27,133
-My blood is--

225
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:28,133
[hearbeat]

226
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:28,633
--boiling.

227
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:34,566
NIGHT RIKUO: NIGHT
RIKUO: You already know.

228
00:15:38,433 --> 00:15:40,533
-I don't know.

229
00:15:40,566 --> 00:15:42,933
I have no power.

230
00:15:42,966 --> 00:15:45,233
I'm a human.

231
00:15:45,266 --> 00:15:46,433
NIGHT RIKUO: No.

232
00:15:46,466 --> 00:15:49,899
You should know about the
true power within you.

233
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:08,499
Don't worry.

234
00:16:08,533 --> 00:16:10,766
I'll carry out your fight.

235
00:16:27,266 --> 00:16:28,999
-Aw.

236
00:16:29,033 --> 00:16:29,599
-Wait, you're--

237
00:16:35,366 --> 00:16:38,833
-We're going to go hunt rats
until the break of dawn.

238
00:16:45,099 --> 00:16:48,433
KYUSO: Did you know
that human blood

239
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:52,333
is at its most thick and
delicious just before dawn?

240
00:16:59,366 --> 00:17:01,766
-You stay away from us.

241
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:04,866
If only I had a shikigami.

242
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:07,099
-Wishing you had this
little scrap of paper?

243
00:17:11,533 --> 00:17:12,966
YURA (VOICEOVER): This is bad.

244
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:14,899
Please someone save us.

245
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:28,066
-Hey, Kyuso, what is that?

246
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:30,399
-I've only heard tales of it.

247
00:17:30,433 --> 00:17:36,033
I think that it's the Night
Parade of a Hundred Demons.

248
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:45,533
-What are you doing?

249
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:48,333
Who ordered all of
you to mobilize?

250
00:17:48,366 --> 00:17:51,733
Only the lord can
mobilize the night parade.

251
00:17:51,766 --> 00:17:54,766
-The lord is right before you.

252
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:55,266
-What?

253
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:09,299
-This is the grandson of our
Supreme Commander Nurarihyon.

254
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:13,299
He is to become the
next lord of the yokai.

255
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,866
-So did you send out the
letter like you promised?

256
00:18:19,133 --> 00:18:20,733
-Are you referring to this?

257
00:18:25,499 --> 00:18:26,299
-What are you doing?

258
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:26,799
-Bastard.

259
00:18:30,033 --> 00:18:32,433
-Get back.

260
00:18:32,466 --> 00:18:33,433
-Quickly.

261
00:18:33,466 --> 00:18:36,366
-So that's the
Supreme Commander?

262
00:18:36,399 --> 00:18:38,333
-Yura, we've got to hurry.

263
00:18:38,366 --> 00:18:38,833
-Right.

264
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:43,899
-Seems the cats have escaped.

265
00:18:43,933 --> 00:18:44,733
-Dammit.

266
00:18:44,766 --> 00:18:46,433
You won't get away with this.

267
00:18:46,466 --> 00:18:47,866
I'm going to kill you all.

268
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:53,333
-Hey, Kuro.

269
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:57,333
Let's see which one of us
can take down the most.

270
00:18:57,366 --> 00:18:58,166
-Die.

271
00:18:58,199 --> 00:18:59,766
-Dance of the Black Weapons.

272
00:19:03,133 --> 00:19:04,666
-That's cheating.

273
00:19:04,699 --> 00:19:07,199
-That is the best compliment
you could give me.

274
00:19:07,233 --> 00:19:10,833
I am Kurotabo, the assassin
monk of the Nura Clan.

275
00:19:10,866 --> 00:19:12,099
Huh?

276
00:19:12,133 --> 00:19:14,066
-While you're there
trying to look cool.

277
00:19:14,099 --> 00:19:15,333
I'm scoring points.

278
00:19:24,133 --> 00:19:26,066
-Oh my.

279
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:28,699
Well, if it isn't the
head of the Bakeneko Clan.

280
00:19:28,733 --> 00:19:32,133
I believe your name
was Ryota Neko.

281
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:33,633
Are you injured?

282
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:35,466
-I'm your opponent.

283
00:19:35,499 --> 00:19:37,299
-Master Rikuo, you're
letting him fight.

284
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,533
-Please let me do this, master.

285
00:19:39,566 --> 00:19:42,333
I've got to avenge my henchmen.

286
00:19:42,366 --> 00:19:46,899
I must honor the sacrifices
they all made for my clan.

287
00:19:46,933 --> 00:19:48,899
-Oh, how very old
fashioned of you.

288
00:19:53,199 --> 00:19:54,799
-Ryota Neko, wait!

289
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:08,633
-This is for my henchmen.

290
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:15,299
-Ryota Neko, are you all right?

291
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:16,533
-Of course, I am.

292
00:20:16,566 --> 00:20:18,933
-Is that all you've got.

293
00:20:18,966 --> 00:20:21,199
I'd like to play with you more.

294
00:20:21,233 --> 00:20:23,799
You're mildly amusing for a cat.

295
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,799
But there's just no end to you.

296
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:26,999
-What?

297
00:20:27,033 --> 00:20:29,233
-I'll deal with you two
after I kill your leader.

298
00:20:36,899 --> 00:20:37,599
What is this?

299
00:20:41,756 --> 00:20:46,717
-Meikyou-Shisui "Sakura."

300
00:20:49,197 --> 00:20:52,016
It burns everything
until the ripples quell

301
00:20:52,016 --> 00:20:53,657
and the liquid stills.

302
00:20:54,957 --> 00:20:58,566
If you hadn't come after me,
you may have had a chance.

303
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,578
I wasn't planning
on getting involved.

304
00:21:04,036 --> 00:21:08,316
-The Nura Clan is tied by its
obsolete rules and traditions.

305
00:21:08,316 --> 00:21:10,697
Your clan has no future.

306
00:21:10,697 --> 00:21:12,397
I want it gone.

307
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:14,717
I want freedom.

308
00:21:25,633 --> 00:21:29,133
-The next time we meet,
I promise to defeat you.

309
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,066
-Until then.

310
00:21:36,566 --> 00:21:38,733
NARRATOR: The
morning mist dampens,

311
00:21:38,766 --> 00:21:41,733
leaving the young girls
to their thoughts.

312
00:21:41,766 --> 00:21:43,766
What path will they
take from here?

313
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:45,633
Only time will tell.

314
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:47,866
KANA (VOICEOVER): Why do
I feel like I know him?

315
00:21:50,566 --> 00:21:52,333
NIGHT RIKUO: It's
misty this morning.

316
00:21:52,366 --> 00:21:54,399
It feels good.

317
00:21:54,433 --> 00:21:57,699
What do you say we take a
little walk before heading home?

318
00:21:59,032 --> 00:22:00,230
YUKI ONNA: I'd love to.

319
00:23:39,399 --> 00:23:41,066
RIKUO: Hey, Yuki
Onna, how old are you?

320
00:23:41,099 --> 00:23:41,699
YUKI ONNA: Huh?

321
00:23:41,733 --> 00:23:42,933
Well--

322
00:23:42,966 --> 00:23:44,666
RIKUO: Oh, was it something
I shouldn't have asked?

323
00:23:44,699 --> 00:23:45,366
[crying]

324
00:23:45,399 --> 00:23:46,099
