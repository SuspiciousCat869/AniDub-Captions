1
00:00:09,927 --> 00:00:12,668
NARRATOR: In days of old,
people feared the yokai.

2
00:00:12,668 --> 00:00:16,568
The one who stood at the helm
and led the Night Parade of 100

3
00:00:16,601 --> 00:00:22,434
Demons was known as the
Supreme Commander of the Yokai.

4
00:00:22,468 --> 00:00:25,434
They had another name
for him, the Lord

5
00:00:25,468 --> 00:00:27,568
of Pandemonium-- Nurarihyon.

6
00:00:30,401 --> 00:00:33,501
[theme music]

7
00:02:05,029 --> 00:02:06,595
INUGAMI: You are
the only one fit

8
00:02:06,629 --> 00:02:08,862
to take control of this world.

9
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:10,929
[panting]

10
00:02:10,962 --> 00:02:14,495
Give me the order, and I'll
gladly bring you his head.

11
00:02:17,495 --> 00:02:20,262
Come on, Tamazuki,
let me be your fangs

12
00:02:20,295 --> 00:02:22,695
so I can tear him apart.

13
00:02:22,729 --> 00:02:23,195
-Humph.

14
00:02:26,362 --> 00:02:39,195
GIRL: "The Evil Dog
Howls at the Ruins."

15
00:02:39,229 --> 00:02:41,295
-I, too, no longer
have the energy

16
00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:44,462
to rule over the
100 Demons anymore.

17
00:02:44,495 --> 00:02:47,829
Before I knew it, the
number dropped to 71.

18
00:02:47,862 --> 00:02:50,695
-Yes, well, we both
aged quite a bit.

19
00:02:50,729 --> 00:02:51,829
-No, wait.

20
00:02:51,862 --> 00:02:55,729
Hihi recently died, so
it's actually 70 now.

21
00:02:55,762 --> 00:02:58,562
Killed by a scrawny
yokai named Muchi.

22
00:02:58,595 --> 00:02:59,395
-What?

23
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,929
Did you say Muchi?

24
00:03:01,962 --> 00:03:04,195
So that's why you
came to see me.

25
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:06,962
-I take it that name
is familiar to you?

26
00:03:06,995 --> 00:03:09,795
DANUKI: He works
for my foolish son.

27
00:03:09,829 --> 00:03:11,029
-Your son?

28
00:03:11,062 --> 00:03:12,995
Well, I suspected as much.

29
00:03:13,029 --> 00:03:15,962
DANUKI: Tamazuki is the
8th son of my 88th wife.

30
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:16,895
-Huh?

31
00:03:16,929 --> 00:03:18,195
DANUKI: Of all my
children, he is

32
00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:20,995
the one who has inherited
my supernatural powers most

33
00:03:21,029 --> 00:03:21,495
strongly.

34
00:03:21,529 --> 00:03:22,295
-What?

35
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:24,195
You mean, you have 88 wives?

36
00:03:24,229 --> 00:03:26,562
-That's not what you
should be surprised about.

37
00:03:26,595 --> 00:03:27,829
-Oh, heh.

38
00:03:27,862 --> 00:03:30,729
-Tamazuki is like
me when I was young,

39
00:03:30,762 --> 00:03:33,395
trying everything he can
to gain power and rule

40
00:03:33,429 --> 00:03:36,062
the yokai through fear.

41
00:03:36,095 --> 00:03:39,295
He now leads a group of yokai
known as the Seven Phantom

42
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:40,229
Travelers.

43
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:42,229
-Seven Phantom Travelers, huh?

44
00:03:42,262 --> 00:03:44,395
-Among them is one
known as Inugami.

45
00:03:44,429 --> 00:03:48,229
He is an especially violent
and dangerous yokai.

46
00:03:48,262 --> 00:03:51,462
-The yokai Inugami.

47
00:03:51,495 --> 00:03:53,929
DANUKI: Hate and
malice feeds his power.

48
00:03:53,962 --> 00:03:56,262
Of all of them, he
is one to be feared.

49
00:03:56,295 --> 00:03:57,162
-[grunts]

50
00:04:02,295 --> 00:04:05,229
-Why are you so
fixated on Rikuo Nura?

51
00:04:05,262 --> 00:04:06,629
-Because he's cocky.

52
00:04:06,662 --> 00:04:09,095
He has no real
strength to speak of,

53
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:11,929
yet he still gets to be the
leader of the Nura Clan.

54
00:04:11,962 --> 00:04:13,229
-Yes, he does.

55
00:04:13,262 --> 00:04:15,795
That's why I intended to keep
him as decoration instead

56
00:04:15,829 --> 00:04:16,962
of killing him.

57
00:04:16,995 --> 00:04:18,562
-Not good enough, Tamazuki.

58
00:04:18,595 --> 00:04:20,162
The weak must die.

59
00:04:20,195 --> 00:04:22,962
That is the first law
of the Shikoku yokai.

60
00:04:22,995 --> 00:04:23,995
Isn't that so?

61
00:04:24,029 --> 00:04:25,329
-Hm.

62
00:04:25,362 --> 00:04:26,729
Do as you please.

63
00:04:26,762 --> 00:04:30,995
We both know that your powers
can easily take out Rikuo Nura.

64
00:04:31,029 --> 00:04:31,495
-He-he.

65
00:04:34,395 --> 00:04:36,662
Then I will do as I please.

66
00:04:39,995 --> 00:04:42,262
-Are you going by yourself?

67
00:04:42,295 --> 00:04:43,495
-Yeah.

68
00:04:43,529 --> 00:04:45,795
-You'd do anything for
Tamazuki, no matter what it was,

69
00:04:45,829 --> 00:04:46,462
wouldn't you?

70
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:47,829
-I guess.

71
00:04:47,862 --> 00:04:52,695
-I'm rather curious as to why
you're so loyal to Tamazuki.

72
00:04:52,729 --> 00:04:54,995
-Because Tamazuki
helped change my life.

73
00:04:55,029 --> 00:04:55,929
-Uh!

74
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,495
-He awakened the
awesome power that

75
00:04:57,529 --> 00:04:59,562
had been buried
deep inside of me.

76
00:04:59,595 --> 00:05:00,495
-Hm.

77
00:05:00,529 --> 00:05:02,962
-The power of hatred!

78
00:05:02,995 --> 00:05:05,629
[snarls]

79
00:05:05,662 --> 00:05:08,629
-It's ugly when
Inugami gets serious.

80
00:05:08,662 --> 00:05:12,662
I'd rather not see him use
that power of his. [chuckles]

81
00:05:12,695 --> 00:05:13,495
KIYOTSUGU: What?

82
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:15,629
You got another Nurarihyon card?

83
00:05:15,662 --> 00:05:17,629
I lose!

84
00:05:17,662 --> 00:05:19,529
-51 consecutive losses!

85
00:05:19,562 --> 00:05:22,829
And trumped each and every
time by a Natto Kozo card.

86
00:05:22,862 --> 00:05:24,995
-You know the fact that
you drew the same card

87
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:26,862
each time is actually
pretty amazing.

88
00:05:26,895 --> 00:05:28,962
-Don't they ever get
tired of that game?

89
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:29,795
-Seriously.

90
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,595
-Damn that blasted Natto Kozo!

91
00:05:31,629 --> 00:05:33,329
What does he have against me?

92
00:05:33,362 --> 00:05:35,162
I've never done anything to him!

93
00:05:35,195 --> 00:05:36,095
-Play another around?

94
00:05:36,129 --> 00:05:36,762
-Oh?

95
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:37,929
All right, come on!

96
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:39,829
Bring it on!

97
00:05:39,862 --> 00:05:40,529
What?

98
00:05:40,562 --> 00:05:42,295
I got Natto Kozo again?

99
00:05:42,329 --> 00:05:45,029
SHIMA: 52 straight losses?

100
00:05:45,062 --> 00:05:46,295
-Hah!

101
00:05:46,329 --> 00:05:49,062
Look at them acting all
friendly around those humans.

102
00:05:49,095 --> 00:05:50,662
He's a yokai like us.

103
00:05:50,695 --> 00:05:53,395
How come those idiots seem
to like him so damn much?

104
00:05:53,429 --> 00:05:56,829
-Ahh, huh?

105
00:05:56,862 --> 00:05:58,129
-What's wrong?

106
00:05:58,162 --> 00:05:59,362
We got intruders?

107
00:05:59,395 --> 00:06:02,662
-I thought I sensed unfamiliar
yokai aura just now.

108
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:05,395
-Ugh, well, I don't
see anyone here.

109
00:06:05,429 --> 00:06:06,362
-Me neither.

110
00:06:09,262 --> 00:06:10,962
-You're so well protected.

111
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:13,929
Well, don't think that's
going to last for very long,

112
00:06:13,962 --> 00:06:16,695
Rikuo Nura.

113
00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:17,329
KIYOTSUGU: Aah!

114
00:06:17,362 --> 00:06:18,295
I lost again!

115
00:06:18,329 --> 00:06:19,762
SHIMA: [laughs]

116
00:06:19,795 --> 00:06:21,995
-I can't believe master's
not bored already.

117
00:06:22,029 --> 00:06:23,395
-No kidding.

118
00:06:23,429 --> 00:06:26,462
What's he thinking playing silly
card games at a time like this?

119
00:06:26,495 --> 00:06:28,695
KUBINASHI: You mean you
haven't figured it out?

120
00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:29,629
BOTH: Hm?

121
00:06:29,662 --> 00:06:31,129
-The Shikoku yokai
were originally

122
00:06:31,162 --> 00:06:33,362
plotting to cut
off our resources

123
00:06:33,395 --> 00:06:34,995
by killing the local deities.

124
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:36,029
-Yes.

125
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,295
But we put a stop to
that by taking out

126
00:06:37,329 --> 00:06:39,462
Lord Sodemogi, the
one responsible.

127
00:06:39,495 --> 00:06:42,729
-That's why it's inevitable that
they will make their next move.

128
00:06:42,762 --> 00:06:45,162
-What is their next
move going to be?

129
00:06:45,195 --> 00:06:46,529
-Oh, don't tell me--

130
00:06:46,562 --> 00:06:49,695
-They're going to come after
our leader and try to kill him.

131
00:06:49,729 --> 00:06:52,829
-In other words, they're
going to target Master Rikuo.

132
00:06:52,862 --> 00:06:54,062
-Yes.

133
00:06:54,095 --> 00:06:55,929
And because of that, the
likelihood that they'll also

134
00:06:55,962 --> 00:06:57,895
target our master's
closest human friends

135
00:06:57,929 --> 00:07:00,729
has grown considerably.

136
00:07:00,762 --> 00:07:01,695
-Hm.

137
00:07:01,729 --> 00:07:03,362
-That's why it's
even more critical

138
00:07:03,395 --> 00:07:06,695
that master keep his friends in
this mansion for their safety.

139
00:07:06,729 --> 00:07:08,129
-[grunts]

140
00:07:08,162 --> 00:07:09,595
-Uh.

141
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,529
-Humph.

142
00:07:11,562 --> 00:07:12,495
-Uh, huh, why?

143
00:07:12,529 --> 00:07:15,062
Why Natto Kozo again?

144
00:07:15,095 --> 00:07:16,929
-107 losses.

145
00:07:16,962 --> 00:07:17,729
-Aah!

146
00:07:17,762 --> 00:07:20,395
Why can't I ever win? [sobs]

147
00:07:20,429 --> 00:07:21,795
-Another round?

148
00:07:21,829 --> 00:07:22,529
-Uh.

149
00:07:22,562 --> 00:07:23,429
-Hm.

150
00:07:23,462 --> 00:07:24,595
[dings]

151
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:25,129
-Huh?

152
00:07:25,162 --> 00:07:25,895
-I got mail!

153
00:07:25,929 --> 00:07:27,095
-From who?

154
00:07:27,129 --> 00:07:31,295
-Someone posted something
up on my message board.

155
00:07:31,329 --> 00:07:34,162
As you all know, the official
Kiyojuji Paranormal Patrol

156
00:07:34,195 --> 00:07:37,062
website has a fully interactive
public message board on it,

157
00:07:37,095 --> 00:07:38,729
where people from
all over the country

158
00:07:38,762 --> 00:07:40,862
post information
about yokai sightings.

159
00:07:40,895 --> 00:07:42,495
-Yeah, but most
of them are fake.

160
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:43,895
-That's right.

161
00:07:43,929 --> 00:07:45,229
KIYOTSUGU: As long as there's
a one-in-a-million chance that

162
00:07:45,262 --> 00:07:46,962
any are true, then
that's fine with me.

163
00:07:46,995 --> 00:07:47,462
Hm?

164
00:07:47,495 --> 00:07:48,029
Whoa.

165
00:07:48,062 --> 00:07:48,962
What is this?

166
00:07:48,995 --> 00:07:50,029
NURA: What's the matter?

167
00:07:50,062 --> 00:07:51,829
-This is a post that's
really promising.

168
00:07:51,862 --> 00:07:53,662
-Well, what makes you say that?

169
00:07:53,695 --> 00:07:56,029
-Because it talks about
the old school building.

170
00:07:56,062 --> 00:07:57,395
-The one we went to?

171
00:08:03,662 --> 00:08:04,662
-What are you waiting for?

172
00:08:04,695 --> 00:08:05,962
Come look at this!

Patrol Message Board"?

174
00:08:12,829 --> 00:08:15,095
KIYOTSUGU: "The old building
at Ukiyoe Middle School

175
00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:16,629
is haunted by yokai."

176
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,995
According to the detailed
information on this post,

177
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:21,129
there is a projector inside
Ukiyoe Middle School's

178
00:08:21,162 --> 00:08:22,795
old auditorium building.

179
00:08:22,829 --> 00:08:24,562
And it says that if
you run the projector,

180
00:08:24,595 --> 00:08:26,329
a yokai appears on the screen.

181
00:08:26,362 --> 00:08:28,862
It says it's a 16-millimeter
film projector.

182
00:08:28,895 --> 00:08:30,829
And there's a generator
in the projection room.

183
00:08:30,862 --> 00:08:33,862
All we have to do is start the
generator to turn the power on.

184
00:08:33,895 --> 00:08:36,495
-Well, we haven't gotten around
to checking out the auditorium

185
00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:37,895
yet.

186
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:40,629
-It seems like that old building
was haunted by yokai after all.

187
00:08:40,662 --> 00:08:42,962
This calls for a complete
and thorough investigation

188
00:08:42,995 --> 00:08:43,995
immediately!

189
00:08:44,029 --> 00:08:44,995
-Huh?

190
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:47,729
-Kiyojuji Paranormal
Patrol, roll out!

191

ALL: [groans]

192
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:49,462
-No!

193
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:50,495
No, wait!

194
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:51,762
You can't go!

195
00:08:51,795 --> 00:08:53,129
-And why not?

196
00:08:53,162 --> 00:08:55,595
Is there something you think
you should be telling us, Nura?

197
00:08:55,629 --> 00:08:57,395
-Well, it's getting pretty late.

198
00:08:57,429 --> 00:08:58,429
We shouldn't go.

199
00:08:58,462 --> 00:09:00,095
-What are you talking about?

200
00:09:00,129 --> 00:09:02,895
Everyone knows that nighttime
is when yokai appear.

201
00:09:02,929 --> 00:09:04,162
-Yeah, but.

202
00:09:04,195 --> 00:09:06,095
-Haven't we had enough of
that old school building?

203
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:07,529
-I agree.

204
00:09:07,562 --> 00:09:09,695
-We never got to check
out the auditorium.

205
00:09:09,729 --> 00:09:11,895
Besides, there's
a chance we might

206
00:09:11,929 --> 00:09:13,962
run into the leader
of the 100 Demons.

207
00:09:13,995 --> 00:09:14,462
-Uh!

208
00:09:19,095 --> 00:09:22,362
-But, uh, oh, yeah, it's
almost dinnertime, remember?

209
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:25,429
-Nura, you've been acting
awfully weird all day today,

210
00:09:25,462 --> 00:09:26,329
you know.

211
00:09:26,362 --> 00:09:26,895
-What?

212
00:09:26,929 --> 00:09:28,262
No, I haven't.

213
00:09:28,295 --> 00:09:30,095
-Someone is being
a party pooper.

214
00:09:30,129 --> 00:09:33,895
-Uhh, oh, no, I
mean, I, uh, really

215
00:09:33,929 --> 00:09:35,829
don't feel like going
out of the house today.

216
00:09:35,862 --> 00:09:36,462
That's all.

217
00:09:36,495 --> 00:09:36,962
See?

218
00:09:36,995 --> 00:09:39,462
[chuckles]

219
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:40,462
-Excuse me.

220
00:09:40,495 --> 00:09:42,429
There's a call for
you, Master Rikuo.

221
00:09:42,462 --> 00:09:43,162
-Huh?

222
00:09:43,195 --> 00:09:43,795
For me?

223
00:09:43,829 --> 00:09:44,295
-Uh.

224
00:09:49,062 --> 00:09:50,462
-[chuckles]

225
00:09:50,495 --> 00:09:53,529
-Haah, hah, hah, haah, heeh.

226
00:09:53,562 --> 00:09:54,729
-Hello, this is Rikuo.

227
00:09:54,762 --> 00:09:57,329
Who am I speaking to?

228
00:09:57,362 --> 00:09:58,929
Hello?

229
00:09:58,962 --> 00:09:59,929
Hm.

230
00:09:59,962 --> 00:10:01,895
[static noise]

231
00:10:01,929 --> 00:10:03,262
Who is this?

232
00:10:03,295 --> 00:10:06,329
-We didn't get to talk very much
last time we saw each other.

233
00:10:06,362 --> 00:10:07,529
-You're that yokai.

234
00:10:13,995 --> 00:10:15,329
What is it you want?

235
00:10:15,362 --> 00:10:17,629
INUGAMI: Rikuo Nura,
you should know

236
00:10:17,662 --> 00:10:20,862
that I'm just
itching to kill you.

237
00:10:20,895 --> 00:10:23,995
But you're cooped up in your
house and won't come out.

238
00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:25,062
-Uh.

239
00:10:25,095 --> 00:10:26,429
INUGAMI (ON PHONE):
So I thought, maybe

240
00:10:26,462 --> 00:10:28,729
I just pick on some of your
precious little human friends

241
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:29,262
instead.

242
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,195
How's that?

243
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:31,395
-Ugh.

244
00:10:31,429 --> 00:10:32,695
INUGAMI (ON PHONE): I
prepared something special

245
00:10:32,729 --> 00:10:35,429
that your friends will
be very interested in.

246
00:10:35,462 --> 00:10:36,695
-Uh!

247
00:10:36,729 --> 00:10:38,995
-Come to me, Rikuo Nura.

248
00:10:45,129 --> 00:10:46,429
[slurps]

249
00:10:49,195 --> 00:10:50,829
-Uhh.

250

KIYOTSUGU (VOICEOVER): Nura, the
Kiyojuji Patrol is setting out.

251
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:55,629
We'll meet you at the
old school building.

252
00:10:55,662 --> 00:10:56,829
-No way.

253
00:10:56,862 --> 00:10:58,062
Uh.

254
00:10:58,095 --> 00:10:59,495
Inugami?

255
00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:00,462
Oh, no!

256
00:11:00,495 --> 00:11:03,095
It's a trap. [panting]

257
00:11:16,629 --> 00:11:17,095
-Oh.

258
00:11:20,129 --> 00:11:21,729
-Hey there, Yura.

259
00:11:21,762 --> 00:11:24,195
Thank you for coming out
here on such short notice.

260
00:11:24,229 --> 00:11:25,495
GIRLS: Hey!

261
00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:27,329
-You're going into the
old school building?

262
00:11:27,362 --> 00:11:28,595
-That's right!

263
00:11:28,629 --> 00:11:30,729
We received some very
reliable information about it.

264
00:11:30,762 --> 00:11:33,295
This time, we're going to
prove the existence of yokai,

265
00:11:33,329 --> 00:11:34,429
once and for all!

266
00:11:34,462 --> 00:11:36,162
-It's going to be
getting dark soon.

267
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,229
Won't it be dangerous?

268
00:11:38,262 --> 00:11:39,162
-Don't worry!

269
00:11:39,195 --> 00:11:41,195
If anything happens,
I have this!

270
00:11:41,229 --> 00:11:42,062
-Uh?

271
00:11:42,095 --> 00:11:43,695
-Now, check this bad boy, out!

272
00:11:43,729 --> 00:11:46,529
This sword that I've drawn isn't
just some common ordinary blade

273
00:11:46,562 --> 00:11:49,395
that you could find in any old
merchant shop in any old town.

274
00:11:49,429 --> 00:11:51,529
The Seven-Branched
Sword of Exorcism.

275
00:11:51,562 --> 00:11:54,162
It's a super secret weapon
for exterminating yokai.

276
00:11:54,195 --> 00:11:56,395
En no Ozumu yielded
to nature and trained

277
00:11:56,429 --> 00:11:59,395
in fields and mountains to
establish its asceticism.

278
00:11:59,429 --> 00:12:01,162
A descendant of
the father-in-law

279
00:12:01,195 --> 00:12:02,729
of the grandchild
of his cousin, spent

280
00:12:02,762 --> 00:12:05,295
three days and three nights
forging this mystic sword which

281
00:12:05,329 --> 00:12:07,495
could only be purchased
on the internet.

282
00:12:07,529 --> 00:12:08,429
Ha-ha!

283
00:12:08,462 --> 00:12:09,662
-You've been totally swindled.

284
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:10,929
-It's made of wood.

285
00:12:10,962 --> 00:12:12,762
KIYOTSUGU: It's a wooden sword!

286
00:12:12,795 --> 00:12:13,995
-All right.

287
00:12:14,029 --> 00:12:15,995
I'll go with you.

288
00:12:16,029 --> 00:12:17,529
Are you happy now?

289
00:12:17,562 --> 00:12:18,495
-Oh?

290
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:19,862
Excellent.

291
00:12:19,895 --> 00:12:21,995
With your onmyoji skills and
my sword, we'll be unstoppable.

292
00:12:22,029 --> 00:12:22,495
-Wait.

293
00:12:22,529 --> 00:12:23,295
-What?

294
00:12:23,329 --> 00:12:24,895
-Nura's not with you?

295
00:12:24,929 --> 00:12:26,329
-He's coming to join us later.

296
00:12:26,362 --> 00:12:29,095
By the power of this sword,
protect the Kiyojuji Paranormal

297
00:12:29,129 --> 00:12:30,562
Patrol from harm's way!

298
00:12:39,895 --> 00:12:41,362
Well, here we are.

299

-[groans]

300
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:44,295
Never thought I'd be
coming here again.

301
00:12:44,329 --> 00:12:47,729
-Little do they know, they're
going to be food for us.

302
00:12:47,762 --> 00:12:51,595
[panting]

303
00:12:51,629 --> 00:12:54,662
Remember, just do as I say,
and I will let each of you

304
00:12:54,695 --> 00:12:58,029
stray yokai become a
part of Tamazuki's 88

305
00:12:58,062 --> 00:13:00,362
Demons of Shikoku.

306
00:13:00,395 --> 00:13:02,562
Rikuo Nura, you're a yokai.

307
00:13:02,595 --> 00:13:05,429
So why are you trying to
save those pathetic humans?

308
00:13:05,462 --> 00:13:06,829
It just makes me sick!

309
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:17,929
-[gasping]

310
00:13:32,104 --> 00:13:34,171
KUBINASHI: How could you
let master go by himself?

311
00:13:34,204 --> 00:13:35,704
AOTABO: He was gone
before I knew it.

312
00:13:35,737 --> 00:13:37,304
KEJORO: He left after
that phone call.

313
00:13:37,337 --> 00:13:39,071
-We must hurry to the
old school building.

314
00:13:39,104 --> 00:13:41,471
-Oh, master, please wait for us!

315
00:13:41,504 --> 00:13:45,137
-You know, this place isn't as
scary as the first time around.

316
00:13:45,171 --> 00:13:46,137
KIYOTSUGU: You're right!

00:13:46,171 --> 00:13:46,937
Come on.

318
00:13:46,971 --> 00:13:48,237
The auditorium is this way.

319
00:13:48,271 --> 00:13:50,337
-I didn't know they had
an auditorium in here.

320
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:51,637
KIYOTSUGU: Neither did I, Maki.

321
00:13:51,671 --> 00:13:55,137
You know, according to the
post, the auditorium was already

322
00:13:55,171 --> 00:13:56,837
off-limits to the
students back when

323
00:13:56,871 --> 00:13:59,037
this school building
was still in use.

324
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:00,071
NATSUMI: Off-limits?

325
00:14:00,104 --> 00:14:02,237
Are you sure we
should be going in?

326
00:14:02,271 --> 00:14:03,437
Scary.

327
00:14:03,471 --> 00:14:04,804
YURA (VOICEOVER):
That's strange.

328
00:14:04,837 --> 00:14:07,771
I sense yokai aura
all over this place.

329
00:14:07,804 --> 00:14:10,104
And yet I don't see anything.

330
00:14:16,271 --> 00:14:19,571
[man grunts]

331
00:14:19,604 --> 00:14:21,371
-[moans] Is this the place?

332
00:14:26,537 --> 00:14:27,704
NATSUMI: It smells like mold.

333
00:14:27,737 --> 00:14:29,937
MAKI: There's no projector
anywhere in this room.

334
00:14:29,971 --> 00:14:31,937
KIYOTSUGU: Everyone calm down!

335
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:33,337
The projector wouldn't be here.

336
00:14:33,371 --> 00:14:34,837
It'll be up in the
projection room.

337
00:14:34,871 --> 00:14:36,371
Look at that!

338
00:14:36,404 --> 00:14:37,804
-[panting]

339
00:14:37,837 --> 00:14:38,937
What is it?

340
00:14:38,971 --> 00:14:41,404
Oh, a movie screen?

341
00:14:41,437 --> 00:14:42,937
-Absolutely right, Shima.

342
00:14:42,971 --> 00:14:45,037
That is a projection screen.

343
00:14:45,071 --> 00:14:47,204
The post we got says
that the projection room

344
00:14:47,237 --> 00:14:48,804
is located right
behind the screen.

345
00:14:48,837 --> 00:14:50,704
This whole thing is a
rear projection setup.

346
00:14:50,737 --> 00:14:52,671
I think that's pretty
sassy, don't you?

347
00:14:52,704 --> 00:14:54,437
-Did you say "sassy"?

348
00:14:54,471 --> 00:14:55,571
-All right, Shima.

349
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:58,204
Let's get up there and
set up the projector.

350
00:14:58,237 --> 00:15:00,037
The girls can wait
here until we're ready.

351
00:15:00,071 --> 00:15:01,071
-You got it.

352
00:15:01,104 --> 00:15:03,104
-Hey, are you sure
this is a good idea?

353
00:15:03,137 --> 00:15:04,771
-There's nothing to
worry about, Maki.

354
00:15:04,804 --> 00:15:07,771
Don't forget, I have this
sword to protect us from yokai.

355
00:15:07,804 --> 00:15:09,404
Now, just sit back
and relax while we

356
00:15:09,437 --> 00:15:10,971
get the projector started.

357
00:15:11,004 --> 00:15:12,904

SHIMA: [laughs]

359

YURA (VOICEOVER): I don't
like this feeling I'm getting.

-[gasps]

361
00:15:24,637 --> 00:15:25,304
-Hm?

362
00:15:25,337 --> 00:15:26,671
What's wrong, Shima?

363
00:15:26,704 --> 00:15:28,437
-I feel like there's
something here.

364
00:15:28,471 --> 00:15:29,104
-Huh?

365
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:30,104
What are you saying?

366
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:31,471
The yokai are supposed
to appear when

367
00:15:31,504 --> 00:15:32,771
the projector is turned on.

368
00:15:32,804 --> 00:15:33,537
Not right now.

369
00:15:33,571 --> 00:15:34,837
-Buh-- but, Kiyotsugu--

370
00:15:34,871 --> 00:15:37,504
-Shima, haven't you paid any
attention to what I said?

371
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:40,237
If anything happens, I have
this sword to protect us.

372
00:15:40,271 --> 00:15:42,437
-Uh, uh, I guess so.

373
00:15:42,471 --> 00:15:44,671
-Sheesh, you have to stop
being such a scaredy-cat.

374

-[panting]

375
00:16:03,571 --> 00:16:04,371
-Everyone!

376
00:16:04,404 --> 00:16:05,571
-Oh, Rikuo!

377
00:16:05,604 --> 00:16:07,204
-You're kind of late, you know.

378
00:16:07,237 --> 00:16:08,004
-Huh?

379
00:16:08,037 --> 00:16:09,537
You're here, too, Ms. Keikain?

380
00:16:09,571 --> 00:16:11,304
Where are Kiyotsugu and Shima?

381
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:13,304
-They went up to
the projection room.

382
00:16:13,337 --> 00:16:14,337
-What's wrong, Rikuo?

383
00:16:14,371 --> 00:16:15,837
You look like you're upset.

384
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:18,271
-Uh, no, I'm all right.

385
00:16:18,304 --> 00:16:19,304
-Rikuo, you really are.

386
00:16:19,337 --> 00:16:20,404
INUGAMI: Human friends.

387
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:23,637
I never had any.

388
00:16:23,671 --> 00:16:28,471
I suffered so much just
because I was a yokai.

389
00:16:28,504 --> 00:16:34,504
Rikuo Nura, why aren't you
suffering like I always did?

-Attacking a girl from behind?

-Up ahead!

-Don't they know when to quit?

-We'll just have
to force through!

-What was that?

407
00:17:22,537 --> 00:17:23,704
YURA (VOICEOVER): Yokai aura.

408
00:17:23,737 --> 00:17:26,604
It's coming from everywhere.

409
00:17:26,637 --> 00:17:29,471
From there and even from here.

410
00:17:29,504 --> 00:17:30,137
So many.

411
00:17:34,571 --> 00:17:36,871
-As instructed by the
post, I've changed the bulb

412
00:17:36,904 --> 00:17:39,504
and connected the spare
batteries to the projector.

413
00:17:39,537 --> 00:17:40,704
That ought to do it.

414

I just don't get it.

415
00:17:41,704 --> 00:17:43,304
It's supposed to be working.

416
00:17:43,337 --> 00:17:45,304
-But the thing's
not working at all.

417

-Listen, we should
all get out here now.

418

-What about Kiyotsugu and Shima?

419
00:17:49,771 --> 00:17:50,571
-Don't worry.

420
00:17:50,604 --> 00:17:52,104
I'll go back there and get them.

take these three.

-Hm.

-It can't be helped.

424
00:17:56,571 --> 00:17:58,804
We're just going to have to
revert to our last resort.

425
00:17:58,837 --> 00:18:00,171
-Last resort?

426
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,404
-Mm-hm.

427
00:18:01,437 --> 00:18:03,671
Shima, watch very carefully
for future reference.

Oh, boy.

-Rikuo Nura, you like to
stick your nose into things,

don't you?

441
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:38,504
-Yeah, I guess I do.

442
00:18:38,537 --> 00:18:41,204
-All to save those humans.

443
00:18:41,237 --> 00:18:43,937
How noble of you.

00:18:43,971 --> 00:18:45,471
-What do you want?

445
00:18:45,504 --> 00:18:47,271
-But it's useless.

446
00:18:47,304 --> 00:18:49,404
Those humans are
going to become food

447
00:18:49,437 --> 00:18:51,937
for the hungry yokai
that live in this place.

448
00:18:54,737 --> 00:18:56,071
-What's that?

449
00:18:56,104 --> 00:18:58,904
-Don't underestimate the
skills of a Keikain onmyoji.

450
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:00,237
-Why?

451
00:19:00,271 --> 00:19:02,837
Why is it that a weak, pathetic,
and powerless little brat

452
00:19:02,871 --> 00:19:06,637
like you gets to be accepted
by both humans and yokai alike?

453
00:19:06,671 --> 00:19:07,637
Why?

454
00:19:07,671 --> 00:19:09,004
Answer me!

455
00:19:09,037 --> 00:19:12,037
Why do you side with humans?

456
00:19:12,071 --> 00:19:16,604
Humans are weak creatures
who fear and hate yokai!

457
00:19:16,637 --> 00:19:18,037
-You're wrong!

458
00:19:18,071 --> 00:19:20,604
Not all humans hate yokai!

Well, this is the

be able to act so righteous!

-Hm.

-There are no
humans in this world

who don't detest yokai
and find us disgusting.

00:19:36,304 --> 00:19:38,904
Humans, those damn humans!

466
00:19:38,937 --> 00:19:40,404
Each and every one
of them treated

467

me like I was some
kind of monster!

They treated me like a monster!

Yet they don't
treat you like that.

470
00:19:48,837 --> 00:19:51,637
It's just not fair, you know.

471
00:19:51,671 --> 00:19:54,771
You're far, far
weaker than I am.

472
00:19:54,804 --> 00:19:56,671
You're nothing compared to me.

473
00:19:56,704 --> 00:20:00,604
Yet you have everything that
I want but don't possess!

I refuse to acknowledge you!

change the projector bulb.

00:20:30,537 --> 00:20:32,604
There should be at least
one in here somewhere.

490
00:20:32,637 --> 00:20:33,171
-Really?

491
00:20:33,204 --> 00:20:34,437
You think so?

492
00:20:34,471 --> 00:20:37,104
-I'm going to kill you!

493
00:20:37,137 --> 00:20:38,804
Now, prepare to die.

494
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:39,604
Huh?

495
00:20:39,637 --> 00:20:40,537
-Ugh!

496
00:20:40,571 --> 00:20:41,037
-Agh!

497
00:20:41,071 --> 00:20:41,971
-Ugh!

498
00:20:42,004 --> 00:20:42,471
-Agh!

499
00:20:45,337 --> 00:20:45,804
-Hah!

500
00:20:45,837 --> 00:20:48,671
-Ugh!

501
00:20:48,704 --> 00:20:49,704
-That's enough.

502
00:20:49,737 --> 00:20:51,937
-[growls]

503
00:20:51,971 --> 00:20:52,971
-Wait a minute.

504
00:20:53,004 --> 00:20:56,304
You're that bastard
from the other day.

505
00:20:56,337 --> 00:20:57,737
-Thank you, everyone.

506
00:20:57,771 --> 00:21:00,637
-Oh, "thank you,
everyone." [laughs]

507
00:21:00,671 --> 00:21:02,104
You're so weak and boring!

508
00:21:02,137 --> 00:21:03,171
Damn it!

509
00:21:03,204 --> 00:21:04,937
I'm going to kill
every one of you, too!

510
00:21:04,971 --> 00:21:05,804
-Silence!

511
00:21:05,837 --> 00:21:07,137
We need some answers from you.

512
00:21:07,171 --> 00:21:08,571
And you'd better give them.

513
00:21:08,604 --> 00:21:10,804
Like the strength
of the Shikoku yokai

514
00:21:10,837 --> 00:21:12,871
and the site of
your headquarters.

515
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:15,471
-You are always protected
like this by your comrades,

516
00:21:15,504 --> 00:21:17,337
like the weak little
creature you are.

517
00:21:17,371 --> 00:21:18,904
Stop kidding around!

518
00:21:18,937 --> 00:21:21,637
Quit acting like such
spoiled little brat!

519
00:21:21,671 --> 00:21:22,337
Damn it!

520
00:21:22,371 --> 00:21:24,404
You just make me sick!

521
00:21:24,437 --> 00:21:25,637
I hate you!

522
00:21:25,671 --> 00:21:27,004
I hate you!

523
00:21:27,037 --> 00:21:31,537
Rikuo Nura, I want
to kill you now!

524
00:21:31,571 --> 00:21:32,504
-Um!

525
00:21:32,537 --> 00:21:34,504
[rumbling]

526
00:21:34,537 --> 00:21:36,004
-[gasps]

527
00:21:36,037 --> 00:21:38,971
-[gasps]

528
00:21:39,004 --> 00:21:39,471
-Agh!

529
00:21:43,471 --> 00:21:43,937
-Uh?

530
00:21:51,904 --> 00:21:53,837
[gasps]

531
00:21:53,871 --> 00:21:55,837
-[growls]

532
00:21:55,871 --> 00:21:56,337
-Master!

533
00:22:01,304 --> 00:22:01,771
-Huh!

534
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:11,974
[music playing]

535
00:23:38,318 --> 00:23:39,818
NATSUMI: Hey, Yura,
how tall are you?

536
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:41,018
YURA: 1.43 meters.

537
00:23:41,051 --> 00:23:42,051
NATSUMI: And your weight?

538
00:23:42,084 --> 00:23:42,851
YURA: No comment.

539
00:23:42,884 --> 00:23:43,951
NATSUMI: Then let me guess.

540
00:23:43,984 --> 00:23:45,384
I'd say 34 kilos.

541
00:23:45,418 --> 00:23:46,018
YURA: What?

542
00:23:46,051 --> 00:23:47,584
How can you tell?

543
00:23:47,618 --> 00:23:49,051
RIKUO YOKAI
(VOICEOVER): Next time,

544
00:23:49,084 --> 00:23:51,651
"The Curtain Falls
in the Darkness."
