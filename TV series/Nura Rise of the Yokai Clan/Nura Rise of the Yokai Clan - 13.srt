00:00:09,633 --> 00:00:13,500
NARRATOR: In days of
old, people feared Yokai.

2
00:00:13,533 --> 00:00:16,433
The one who stood at the
helm, and led the night

3
00:00:16,466 --> 00:00:18,966
parade of a hundred
demons was known

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,266
as the Supreme
Commander of the Yokai.

5
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,233
They had another name
for him, the Lord

6
00:00:26,266 --> 00:00:28,500
of Pandemonium-- Nurarihyon.

[theme music]

8
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:07,434
TSURARA (VOICEOVER): The
power of the Nura clan

9
00:02:07,467 --> 00:02:09,367
is known throughout the country.

10
00:02:09,401 --> 00:02:10,867
The Gyuki Clan occupies Mt.

11
00:02:10,901 --> 00:02:13,034
Nejireme located
at the Western end

12
00:02:13,067 --> 00:02:15,167
of the Nura Clan's territory.

13
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:17,934
This is the story of how
its leader, Lord Gyuki,

14
00:02:17,967 --> 00:02:21,267
came to rebel against the
Nura Clan's Third Heir, Master

15
00:02:21,301 --> 00:02:24,801
Rikuo, an incident that has
brought lasting consequences

16
00:02:24,834 --> 00:02:27,934
to the Nura Clan's future.

17
00:02:27,967 --> 00:02:30,701
Lord Gyuki's Rebellion--
The Whole Story.

18
00:02:43,667 --> 00:02:47,401
-You would be wise to
answer my questions, Rikuo,

19
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:49,634
and answer each one
of them clearly.

20
00:02:49,667 --> 00:02:52,301
If I'm not satisfied
with any of your answers,

21
00:02:52,334 --> 00:02:56,467
I'll cut off your ears and arms.

22
00:02:56,501 --> 00:02:57,934
TSURARA (VOICEOVER):
Lord Gyuki was

23
00:02:57,967 --> 00:03:00,534
born as a human being
over a thousand years

24
00:03:00,567 --> 00:03:02,834
ago in what was then the
capital city of Japan.

25
00:03:52,134 --> 00:03:53,601
-Mother, do not worry.

26
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:55,501
I will devote myself
to knowledge and train

27
00:03:55,534 --> 00:03:57,567
in the way of the
sword, I promise

28
00:03:57,601 --> 00:04:00,134
I will always protect
you in father's place.

29

[roaring]

[screaming]

31
00:04:47,167 --> 00:04:49,434
-I curse all the gods.

32
00:04:49,467 --> 00:04:51,034
I curse the Buddha.

33
00:04:51,067 --> 00:04:55,067
I curse the world that stole
my mother and father from me,

34
00:04:55,101 --> 00:05:00,267
and I swear that from this day
forward, I will become a demon,

35
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:03,734
and mourn my parents
by devouring humans.

36
00:05:03,767 --> 00:05:04,234
-No!

37
00:05:07,301 --> 00:05:09,901
TSURARA (VOICEOVER): When Lord
Gyuki lost his mother that day,

38
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:15,434
he renounced the name his father
had given to him, Ume Wakamaru,

39
00:05:15,467 --> 00:05:19,701
and became Gyuki, a malicious
Yokai that devoured humans,

40
00:05:19,734 --> 00:05:21,101
and spewed hate.

41
00:06:05,267 --> 00:06:07,734
[growl]

42
00:06:12,234 --> 00:06:14,201
-Haa!

43
00:06:14,234 --> 00:06:16,034
You must be Gyuki

44
00:06:16,067 --> 00:06:18,634
-There's no need to tell you my
name when you're about to die!

45
00:06:21,634 --> 00:06:24,067
[shout]

46
00:06:43,801 --> 00:06:46,567
-I must say, you're very strong.

47
00:06:46,601 --> 00:06:49,734
The rumors were right about
your strength and talent.

48
00:06:49,767 --> 00:06:52,634
Why don't you consider
joining my clan.

49
00:06:52,667 --> 00:06:53,401
How about it?

50
00:07:52,775 --> 00:07:53,308
-Hey.

51
00:07:53,342 --> 00:07:56,675
Karasu Tengu.

52
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:57,708
-Yes

53
00:07:57,742 --> 00:07:59,055
-Go look into our
clan roster and see

54
00:07:59,055 --> 00:08:01,789
if anyone was in
contact with Chozo.

55
00:08:01,822 --> 00:08:03,489
-You think there's
a traitor among us?

56
00:08:05,822 --> 00:08:07,922
TSURARA (VOICEOVER): Lord
Gyuki carried out his plan

57
00:08:07,955 --> 00:08:10,422
very carefully.

58
00:08:10,455 --> 00:08:14,089
One day Master Rikuo and the
Kiyijuji Paranormal Patrol

59
00:08:14,122 --> 00:08:16,855
went to visit a place
called Ume Rakuen.

60
00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:17,989
However.

61
00:08:18,022 --> 00:08:20,889
Ume Rakuen turned out to
be none other than Mt.

62
00:08:20,922 --> 00:08:21,655
Nejireme.

63
00:08:21,689 --> 00:08:23,455
-What are you talking about?

64
00:08:23,489 --> 00:08:27,089
-It's a small shrine, and
I think a Jizo statue.

65
00:08:38,189 --> 00:08:39,489
-What is all this?

66
00:08:39,522 --> 00:08:40,589
-Those, Miss, are claws.

67
00:08:40,622 --> 00:08:42,022
-Claws?

68
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:45,022
-The Yokai live right up
here on this mountain.

69
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:48,289
You can't let a mere
torn off claw scare you.

70
00:08:48,322 --> 00:08:51,255
And the best part is that the
hero of this mountain's Yokai

71
00:08:51,289 --> 00:08:53,789
legend, Ume Wakamaru,
is up there.

72
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:03,422
-I simply can't believe that
he would actually do that.

73
00:09:03,455 --> 00:09:04,355
Hm.

74
00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:06,689
-Rikuo isn't coming home today?

75
00:09:06,722 --> 00:09:07,689
-No.

76
00:09:07,722 --> 00:09:09,489
He's gone on an
outing with his club.

77
00:09:09,522 --> 00:09:14,255
-Karasu Tengu, why don't
you join me for some tea?

78
00:09:14,289 --> 00:09:14,922
-Yes.

79
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:16,522
I'd really like that.

80
00:09:16,555 --> 00:09:19,689
-So where did Rikuo
and his friends go?

81
00:09:19,722 --> 00:09:23,955
-He said they were all
going to Ume Rakuen.

82
00:09:23,989 --> 00:09:25,555
-He went to Ume Rakuen, eh?

83
00:09:25,589 --> 00:09:27,589
Well, I think that's
a great place.

84
00:09:27,622 --> 00:09:28,389
-Oh.

85
00:09:28,422 --> 00:09:29,455
So you've been there before?

86
00:09:29,489 --> 00:09:31,489
-But supreme commander,
that mountain is--

87
00:09:37,989 --> 00:09:40,055
-The fray has come
to the mountain.

88
00:09:51,855 --> 00:09:54,089
TSURARA (VOICEOVER):
Until finally-- Oh, look.

89
00:09:54,122 --> 00:09:54,889
It's me in there.

90
00:09:58,122 --> 00:10:02,889
-I mean this is a
truly historical spot.

91
00:10:02,922 --> 00:10:03,855
-Watch out, master!

92
00:10:06,489 --> 00:10:07,155
Oh.

93
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,189
It's just a raccoon dog.

94
00:10:13,122 --> 00:10:14,322
-All right.

95
00:10:14,355 --> 00:10:16,955
This is the Yokai spot
known as the One-Eyed Pine.

96
00:10:16,989 --> 00:10:18,389
-Hm?

97
00:10:18,422 --> 00:10:20,122
-Let's pass through
one at a time.

98
00:10:20,155 --> 00:10:21,289
-I'll go first.

99
00:10:21,322 --> 00:10:22,055
-Wait a minute.

100
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:23,322
I wanna go through it first.

101
00:10:23,355 --> 00:10:25,255
I wanna make sure it's
safe and sound before I

102
00:10:25,289 --> 00:10:26,555
let anyone else try it.

103
00:10:32,289 --> 00:10:33,122
-OK.

104
00:10:33,155 --> 00:10:34,289
Let's move on, shall we?

105
00:10:41,489 --> 00:10:42,355
-Yes.

106
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:43,755
Now you get to
see how cool I am.

107
00:10:53,155 --> 00:10:54,122
-It's frozen.

108
00:10:54,155 --> 00:10:55,422
-Who are you?

109
00:10:55,455 --> 00:10:58,822
Do you belong to the Gyuki Clan?

110
00:10:58,855 --> 00:11:00,155
-So what if I do?

111
00:11:00,189 --> 00:11:00,922
-I warn you.

112
00:11:00,955 --> 00:11:02,322
Don't do anything stupid.

113
00:11:02,355 --> 00:11:05,022
Now, do you have
any idea who I am?

114
00:11:05,055 --> 00:11:06,922
-I see.

115
00:11:06,955 --> 00:11:08,889
You're a Yuki Onna.

116
00:11:08,922 --> 00:11:11,989
-If you know, then
put away your sword,

117
00:11:12,022 --> 00:11:15,722
and you will not be
blamed for any of this.

118
00:11:15,755 --> 00:11:18,389
[chuckling]

119
00:11:18,422 --> 00:11:20,689
-What's funny?

120
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:21,889
[chuckling]

121
00:11:21,922 --> 00:11:23,989
-You know, if I were you,
I'd cut the laughing.

122
00:11:24,022 --> 00:11:26,422
You don't seem to realize
who you're messing with.

123
00:11:26,455 --> 00:11:28,555
Who do you think
my master is, huh?

124
00:11:28,589 --> 00:11:30,789
-Why don't you just
shut your damn mouth!?

125
00:11:41,722 --> 00:11:44,022
Don't underestimate our clan.

126
00:11:44,055 --> 00:11:46,355
We're putting our lives
on the line for this.

127
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:50,355
-You mean Lord Gyuki sent
you to kill Master Rikuo?

128
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:59,122
-The ever discrete Lord
Gyuki planned everything!

129
00:11:59,155 --> 00:12:00,922
Die!

130
00:12:00,955 --> 00:12:02,389
RIKUO: Tsurara!

131
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:03,389
-No, master!

132
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:03,863
Run away!

133
00:12:03,896 --> 00:12:05,896
-Tsurara!

134
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:06,896
-You're too late!

135
00:12:34,696 --> 00:12:35,163
-Master.

136
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,663
-You call that a fight?

137
00:12:45,696 --> 00:12:49,063
I feel sorry for the blade.

138
00:12:49,096 --> 00:12:52,563
A coward like you can't
even dodge my claw!

139
00:13:09,396 --> 00:13:10,296
Gozu Shadow Claw!

140
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:22,030
-Master, watch out!

141
00:13:22,063 --> 00:13:22,530
Master!

142
00:13:25,963 --> 00:13:28,330
-Yuki Onna!

143
00:13:28,363 --> 00:13:29,330
Damn it.

144
00:13:38,796 --> 00:13:40,796
-The meaning of the Gyuki
Clan's emblem of terror

145
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:44,663
is to manipulate, bewilder,
lure, and kill humans.

146
00:13:44,696 --> 00:13:49,063
There's no way I'd lose
to a mere human like you!

147
00:13:49,096 --> 00:13:49,963
-Ha.

148
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,230
To a mere human, huh?

149
00:13:52,263 --> 00:13:54,763
-This is the end
for you, Rikuo Nura!

150
00:14:02,863 --> 00:14:06,063
How could I lose to you when
you're not even a Yokai?

151
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,263
-The blood flows through me.

152
00:14:18,296 --> 00:14:21,863
The evil blood of the
Supreme Commander.

153
00:14:21,896 --> 00:14:24,230
That's how.

154
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:26,163
TSURARA (VOICEOVER): I
still have some bruises

155
00:14:26,196 --> 00:14:29,663
from that fight,
but enough about me.

156
00:14:29,696 --> 00:14:32,996
What's really important is
that Master Rikuo and Lord

157
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:36,130
Gyuki were meeting
face to face, alone.

158
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,163
-Where is Zen going?

159
00:14:41,196 --> 00:14:43,896
-He seems like he's in
an awfully big rush.

160
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:47,630
-Supreme Commander.

161
00:14:47,663 --> 00:14:50,896
-Lord Zen.

162
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:52,630
-Is what I heard true?

163
00:14:52,663 --> 00:14:55,896
Has Rikuo-- I mean has
Master RIkuo gone up to Mt.

164
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:57,163
Nejireme?

165
00:14:57,196 --> 00:15:00,896
-It seems that news
reaches you rather quickly.

166
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:02,396
-I know this is
none of my business,

167
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:05,730
but I must have my
say, Supreme Commander.

168
00:15:05,763 --> 00:15:09,596
Recently, I've gotten
a strange feeling

169
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:13,496
from Gyuki and some of the
many Yokai that serve him.

170
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:15,163
Is it wise to ignore this?

171
00:15:18,163 --> 00:15:20,096
-I will leave his
all up to Rikuo.

172
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:22,596
-But, sir.

173
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,430
-Any objections?

174
00:15:31,396 --> 00:15:34,430
-Tell me what's on
your mind, Gyuki.

175
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:46,696
-So you've come after all.

176
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:47,963
I see.

177
00:15:47,996 --> 00:15:50,830
It seems you really do have
the supreme commander's

178
00:15:50,863 --> 00:15:51,430
blood in you.

179
00:15:59,496 --> 00:16:01,230
When morning comes
again to the mountain,

180
00:16:01,263 --> 00:16:04,463
will you go back to your
weak and fragile human form,

181
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:09,163
and forget everything
while you were a Yokai?

182
00:16:09,196 --> 00:16:12,096
If the day does not
recognize your Yokai form,

183
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:17,363
are you one person by
day, and another by night?

184
00:16:17,396 --> 00:16:18,963
-Perhaps.

185
00:16:18,996 --> 00:16:22,630
Why is it you're so
concerned about me?

186
00:16:22,663 --> 00:16:23,130
-Fool.

187
00:16:35,363 --> 00:16:39,396
-My resolve has
remained the same

188
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:41,363
since my blood
awakened that day.

189
00:16:48,263 --> 00:16:52,063
I will become the Third Heir
and rule over all Yokai.

190
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:24,096
-Haa!

191
00:17:50,496 --> 00:17:53,463
-Well done, Master Rikuo.

192
00:18:00,963 --> 00:18:04,163
TSURARA (VOICEOVER): The
duel between two great Yokai

193
00:18:04,196 --> 00:18:06,163
ended with Master
Rikuo's victory.

194
00:18:19,863 --> 00:18:21,496
-Rikuo.

195
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:23,196
-I'm here.

196
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:26,396
GYUKI: Listen carefully.

197
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:27,530
Mt.

198
00:18:27,563 --> 00:18:31,163
Nejireme is the western
border of the Nura Clan.

199
00:18:31,196 --> 00:18:35,896
The clan has no influence with
other Yokai beyond that point.

200
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:38,863
From here I can
see it all clearly.

201
00:18:38,896 --> 00:18:42,930
Unless we act now, our
clan will fall apart

202
00:18:42,963 --> 00:18:47,796
from within and without.

203
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:51,296
That is the reason
for all my actions.

204
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:55,796
I won't tolerate anyone who
dares to try and destroy

205
00:18:55,830 --> 00:19:04,396
my beloved Nura Clan, even
if that person is you.

206
00:19:12,463 --> 00:19:14,330
But I was wrong.

207
00:19:14,363 --> 00:19:17,063
You were able to defeat me.

208
00:19:17,096 --> 00:19:20,430
You have proven to have
the skills and the will.

209
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:26,496
And now I shall finish
what I have started!

210
00:19:44,396 --> 00:19:46,730
Why did you stop me, Rikuo?

211
00:19:56,763 --> 00:19:57,696
Why?

212
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,596
I must take
responsibility for this

213
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,830
as the one who plotted treason.

214
00:20:02,863 --> 00:20:04,930
Why didn't you just let me die?

215
00:20:04,963 --> 00:20:08,563
Now I'll never be able
to face Gozu and Mezu.

216
00:20:08,596 --> 00:20:14,330
-Gyuki, you've made your
reasons quite painfully clear.

217
00:20:14,363 --> 00:20:16,230
Once you confirmed
I was weak, you

218
00:20:16,263 --> 00:20:18,663
would kill me and then yourself.

219
00:20:18,696 --> 00:20:20,996
But I turned out
to be legitimate,

220
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:23,330
and yet you still chose death.

221
00:20:23,363 --> 00:20:28,830
That is very much like
you, but you know what?

222
00:20:28,863 --> 00:20:30,430
There's no need to die.

223
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:31,130
This is nothing.

224
00:20:44,263 --> 00:20:45,430
All right.

225
00:20:45,463 --> 00:20:49,030
Let me be your father
from now on, Ume Wakamaru.

226
00:20:58,963 --> 00:21:02,163
-Honestly I wanna live
in peace, but there

227
00:21:02,196 --> 00:21:04,996
are people I need
to protect, and I

228
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:08,063
know I'm going to have to
rely on this blood to do that.

229
00:21:13,263 --> 00:21:16,630
So, you see, if there's
someone like you around who I

230
00:21:16,663 --> 00:21:21,130
can trust, someone who
loves this clan so much,

231
00:21:21,163 --> 00:21:24,196
I want them to stay, and
be a part of the family.

232
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,430
-Family.

233
00:21:25,463 --> 00:21:26,663
-Yeah.

234
00:21:26,696 --> 00:21:28,363
Anyway, you just get some rest.

235
00:21:36,563 --> 00:21:39,230
Thus, with regard
to this incident,

236
00:21:39,263 --> 00:21:41,230
I judge Gyuki not guilty.

237
00:21:41,263 --> 00:21:44,130
There is no sentence, and
I take full responsibility

238
00:21:44,163 --> 00:21:45,596
for what happened.

239
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:50,763
That is why the Gyuki Clan will
remain a part of our family.

240
00:21:50,796 --> 00:21:52,763
TSURARA (VOICEOVER): Lord
Gyuki finally accepted

241
00:21:52,796 --> 00:21:56,263
Master Rikuo as the Third Heir,
and pledged to support him

242
00:21:56,296 --> 00:21:57,830
and the Nura Clan.

243
00:21:57,863 --> 00:22:00,763
And that's the whole story
behind Lord Gyuki's Rebellion,

244
00:22:00,796 --> 00:22:03,063
an incident that changed
the Nura Clan forever.

245
00:22:05,663 --> 00:22:08,563
[theme music]

246
00:23:46,596 --> 00:23:47,996
TSURARA (VOICEOVER):
Shima, Why do

247
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,263
you hang around with Kiyotsugu?

248
00:23:49,296 --> 00:23:50,630
SHIMA: Because he's super rich.

249
00:23:50,663 --> 00:23:51,630
TSURARA (VOICEOVER): Oh.

250
00:23:51,663 --> 00:23:52,396
SHIMA: No.

251
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,096
Wait.

252
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:54,263
I mean he's super cool.

253
00:23:54,296 --> 00:23:55,430
TSURARA (VOICEOVER): Uh-huh.

254
00:23:55,463 --> 00:23:59,096
-Next time-- the
Inugamigyobu-Tanuki, Tamazuki's

255
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:00,563
Beckoning.
