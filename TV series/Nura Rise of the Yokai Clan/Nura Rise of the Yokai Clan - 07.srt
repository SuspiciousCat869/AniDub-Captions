1
00:00:09,966 --> 00:00:14,166
In days of old,
people feared yokai.

2
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,133
The one who stood at the
helm, and lead the night

3
00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:21,300
parade of 100 demons, was
known as the Supreme Commander

4
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:23,533
of the yokai.

5
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:25,966
They had another name for him.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,700
The Lord of
Pandemonium, Nurarihyon.

7
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:09,032
NARRATOR: As though
they were being

8
00:02:09,066 --> 00:02:12,599
led by strange forces,
Rikuo and his friends

9
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:15,066
climb up Mount Nejireme.

10
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:19,599
However, the mountain was home
to the Gyuki Clan, a faction

11
00:02:19,632 --> 00:02:24,132
of the Nura Clan comprised
of the most hostile yokai.

12
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:28,132
The Gyuki Clan's henchmen lurk
in the shadows, eyeing Rikuo

13
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:31,532
and his friends who
have become separated.

14
00:02:31,566 --> 00:02:34,766
What fate awaits the
unsuspecting group?

15
00:02:53,366 --> 00:02:54,799
-Listen, you bastard.

16
00:02:54,832 --> 00:02:58,032
This woman serves me,
Rikuo Nura, the Nura Clan

17
00:02:58,066 --> 00:02:58,766
theird heir.

18
00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:00,566
She's my subordinate.

19
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:05,332
If you attacked her knowing
that, I will kill you.

20
00:03:22,032 --> 00:03:22,499
-Master.

21
00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:47,399
-Rikuo Nura.

22
00:03:50,332 --> 00:03:51,666
RIKUO (VOICEOVER): It's hot.

23
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:54,832
I feel the heat surging
up inside my body.

24
00:03:54,866 --> 00:03:55,766
My blood is boiling.

25
00:04:04,732 --> 00:04:06,966
-Master!

26
00:04:06,999 --> 00:04:09,599
Master!

27
00:04:09,632 --> 00:04:11,799
I still can't find him.

28
00:04:11,832 --> 00:04:13,766
Am I all alone out here?

29
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:14,599
Hm?

30
00:04:14,632 --> 00:04:22,499
[delirious noises]

31
00:04:22,532 --> 00:04:24,866
-Those are Master's friends.

32
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:27,532
Err, I'm getting a bad feeling.

33
00:04:39,332 --> 00:04:39,799
-Rikuo?

34
00:04:48,799 --> 00:04:51,932
-Master, you must
get away from here.

35
00:04:51,966 --> 00:04:56,599
He came here with every
intention of killing you.

36
00:04:56,632 --> 00:04:58,832
-Just stay still, Yuki-Onna.

37
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:02,066
-But, Master, it's my
duty to protect you.

38
00:05:02,099 --> 00:05:06,732
-It's OK, you don't
have to worry.

39
00:05:06,766 --> 00:05:07,199
-Master?

40
00:05:10,032 --> 00:05:12,699
-Hmph, the rumors are true.

41
00:05:12,732 --> 00:05:16,132
A third heir who needs the
protection of a puny guardian

42
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:17,366
like her.

43
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:18,599
What a laughable joke.

44
00:05:21,466 --> 00:05:24,232
-Are you Yuki's subordinates?

45
00:05:24,266 --> 00:05:25,432
-Yes.

46
00:05:25,466 --> 00:05:27,999
I realize we're overstepping
the bounds of honor.

47
00:05:28,032 --> 00:05:30,832
But right now, this is
what our boss desires.

48
00:05:34,366 --> 00:05:38,532
-Now die, Rikuo Nura!

49
00:05:38,566 --> 00:05:40,499
[explosion]

50
00:05:40,532 --> 00:05:42,966
[screaming]

51
00:05:42,999 --> 00:05:43,932
-Bukyoku!

52
00:05:43,966 --> 00:05:44,432
Go!

53
00:05:47,832 --> 00:05:48,899
-Worry not.

54
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:54,099
By Lady Nura's command,
I shall protect you.

55
00:05:54,132 --> 00:05:55,066
-Damn!

56
00:05:55,099 --> 00:05:56,199
Damn!

57
00:05:56,232 --> 00:05:59,299
What the hell is a
Shikigami user doing here?

58
00:05:59,332 --> 00:06:00,699
-Argh!

59
00:06:00,732 --> 00:06:04,599
I wanted to report my success to
Lord Gyuki before Gozumaru did.

60
00:06:04,632 --> 00:06:05,499
-Give it up!

61
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:06,432
Explode!

62
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:07,832
-Damn it!

63
00:06:07,866 --> 00:06:10,232
-He's flying all over the place.

64
00:06:10,266 --> 00:06:10,732
-Huh?

65
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:19,632
[screaming]

66
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:22,066
-What happened?

67
00:06:22,099 --> 00:06:22,566
Huh?

68
00:06:26,032 --> 00:06:27,466
-What the hell?

69
00:06:27,499 --> 00:06:28,832
Who are you?

70
00:06:28,866 --> 00:06:32,599
-You do not seem to comprehend
who you're speaking to, kid.

71
00:06:32,632 --> 00:06:36,399
I'm sure you've heard the
name, the Karasu Tengu family.

72
00:06:36,432 --> 00:06:38,132
-Karasu Tengu?

73
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:40,366
What are the overseers of
the main family doing here?

74
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,599
-Bro, it doesn't look
like Master's here.

75
00:06:42,632 --> 00:06:46,366
-A yokai who attacks
women's baths, how filthy.

76
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:46,866
-What?

77
00:06:46,899 --> 00:06:47,799
No!

78
00:06:47,832 --> 00:06:50,766
-Ommyoji, we'll call
a truce for now,

79
00:06:50,799 --> 00:06:54,766
I apologize for the trouble.

80
00:06:54,799 --> 00:06:59,232
Kid, there's a few things
I'd like to ask you about.

81
00:06:59,266 --> 00:07:01,432
-Stop!

82
00:07:01,466 --> 00:07:02,766
Put me down!

83
00:07:02,799 --> 00:07:04,932
-You're going to
tell us everything.

84
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,099
We want to know all
about the Kyuso incident,

85
00:07:07,132 --> 00:07:10,366
and about Master's
current whereabouts.

86
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:11,732
-Let's get going, bro.

87
00:07:11,766 --> 00:07:13,499
-Right.

88
00:07:13,532 --> 00:07:14,932
-Hey wait, come back!

89
00:07:14,966 --> 00:07:17,199
-Help, help me Ommyoji!

90
00:07:17,232 --> 00:07:22,066
Don't let them take
me, exterminate them!

91
00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:24,632
-Wha-- What was all that about?

92
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,132
-I don't know.

93
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,099
But, we're safe now aren't we?

94
00:07:28,132 --> 00:07:28,599
-Mm-hmm.

95
00:07:33,566 --> 00:07:38,399
[shrieks] Are you
in here, Master?

96
00:07:38,432 --> 00:07:39,899
-It's another one!

97
00:07:39,932 --> 00:07:41,199
-Identify yourself.

98
00:07:41,232 --> 00:07:42,866
-Oh, crap.

99
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:43,366
-Hold it!

100
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,032
-Are those two dead?

101
00:07:49,999 --> 00:07:51,566
Hey, wake up!

102
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,766
Snap out of it!

103
00:07:54,799 --> 00:07:57,132
[gasps]

104
00:07:57,166 --> 00:08:01,899
[scream]

105
00:08:01,932 --> 00:08:05,199
-They said Master.

106
00:08:05,232 --> 00:08:08,466
Does that mean he's here?

107
00:08:21,299 --> 00:08:22,799
-You call that a fight?

108
00:08:22,832 --> 00:08:26,499
I feel sorry for the blade.

109
00:08:26,532 --> 00:08:29,632
A coward like you can't
even dodge my claw!

110
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:39,666
YUKI (VOICEOVER): Master's
still in his day form.

111
00:08:39,699 --> 00:08:42,399
So how can he fight like that?

112
00:08:42,432 --> 00:08:46,432
RIKUO (VOICEOVER): I've known
for a long time this is--

113
00:08:46,466 --> 00:08:49,599
-My own strength!

114
00:08:49,632 --> 00:08:50,732
-(VOICEOVER): It's strange.

115
00:08:50,766 --> 00:08:52,499
I thought he was
a mere human when

116
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,966
his yokai form hasn't awakened.

117
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:02,066
He's strong.

118
00:09:02,099 --> 00:09:05,532
And quick.

119
00:09:05,566 --> 00:09:07,132
-Well then, I shall
show him a sign

120
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:10,166
of respect in the true form
of a Gyuki Clan member!

121
00:09:13,066 --> 00:09:15,899
Gozu shadow claw!

122
00:09:15,932 --> 00:09:16,399
-Master!

123
00:09:22,132 --> 00:09:27,899
[saying spell in japanese]

124
00:09:27,932 --> 00:09:31,966
-I-- I can't move.

125
00:09:31,999 --> 00:09:33,299
What did you--

126
00:09:33,332 --> 00:09:35,399
-You wouldn't understand
if I told you.

127
00:09:40,832 --> 00:09:42,266
-Master, watch out!

128
00:09:45,266 --> 00:09:45,732
Master!

129
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:51,599
-Yuki-Onna!

130
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:52,566
Damn it!

131
00:10:01,866 --> 00:10:03,866
-The meaning of the Gyuki
Clan's emblem of terror

132
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:07,899
is to manipulate, bewilder,
lure, and kill humans!

133
00:10:07,932 --> 00:10:10,132
There's no way I'd lose
to a mere human like you!

134
00:10:12,932 --> 00:10:15,832
-Heh, to a mere human, huh?

135
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:18,766
-This is the end
for you, Rikuo Nura!

136
00:10:23,132 --> 00:10:26,532
[gasp]

137
00:10:26,566 --> 00:10:29,932
-How could I lose to you
when you're not even a yokai.

138
00:10:39,699 --> 00:10:41,766
-The blood flows through me.

139
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:45,932
The evil blood of the Supreme
Commander, that's how.

140
00:10:50,466 --> 00:10:53,032
-And so my lord, that
is the complete report

141
00:10:53,066 --> 00:10:55,366
I received from my
sons regarding this.

142
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:58,399
What are your orders
now, Supreme Commander?

143
00:11:10,366 --> 00:11:13,632
NARRATOR: Man treched a path
through the cold mountain.

144
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:16,866
Ayakashi live on
the cold mountain.

145
00:11:16,899 --> 00:11:20,166
Even when the summer
comes, the ice remains.

146
00:11:20,199 --> 00:11:22,999
Mist obscures the sunlight.

147
00:11:23,032 --> 00:11:26,732
Those who resemble
us find their way.

148
00:11:26,766 --> 00:11:29,299
Our hearts are not the same.

149
00:11:29,332 --> 00:11:32,366
If your heart and
mine are as one,

150
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,199
inevitably we will
come together.

151
00:12:08,056 --> 00:12:09,556
[sigh]

152
00:12:09,589 --> 00:12:11,856
-They're so lucky.

153
00:12:11,889 --> 00:12:14,922
Yuki-Onna and Aotabo I mean.

154
00:12:14,956 --> 00:12:19,022
I wish I could've gone
to the hot spring, too.

155
00:12:19,056 --> 00:12:21,689
-Hot spring aside, I
don't like the fact

156
00:12:21,722 --> 00:12:25,289
that Ao got to escort him
while I stayed behind.

157
00:12:25,322 --> 00:12:27,356
-Calm down, it really
couldn't be helped.

158
00:12:27,389 --> 00:12:28,822
Those two were sent
because they've

159
00:12:28,856 --> 00:12:32,089
been posing as Master Rikuo's
school friends for years.

160
00:12:32,122 --> 00:12:33,322
-Too bad.

161
00:12:33,356 --> 00:12:35,122
Maybe I should
start accompanying

162
00:12:35,156 --> 00:12:37,856
the master to school as well.

163
00:12:37,889 --> 00:12:40,722
I can wear a school uniform.

164
00:12:40,756 --> 00:12:43,156
-Uh, I think you're
a little too old.

165
00:12:43,189 --> 00:12:43,656
-Huh?

166
00:12:48,256 --> 00:12:50,322
-Where is Zen going?

167
00:12:50,356 --> 00:12:52,189
-It seems like he's in
an awfully big rush.

168
00:12:55,089 --> 00:12:55,822
-Supreme Commander.

169
00:12:58,489 --> 00:13:01,689
-Lord Zen?

170
00:13:01,722 --> 00:13:03,556
-Is what I heard true?

171
00:13:03,589 --> 00:13:06,122
Has Rikuo, I mean,
has Master Rikuo

172
00:13:06,156 --> 00:13:08,089
gone up to Mount Nejireme?

173
00:13:08,122 --> 00:13:11,689
-It seems that news
reaches you rather quickly.

174
00:13:11,722 --> 00:13:13,456
-I know this is
none of my business,

175
00:13:13,489 --> 00:13:16,522
but I must have my
say, Supreme Commander.

176
00:13:16,556 --> 00:13:20,322
Recently, I've gotten
a strange feeling

177
00:13:20,356 --> 00:13:24,289
from Gyuki and some of the
many yokai that serve him.

178
00:13:24,322 --> 00:13:26,089
Is it wise to ignore this?

179
00:13:33,456 --> 00:13:35,822
-I will leave this
all up to Rikuo.

180
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:37,222
-But, sir--

181
00:13:37,256 --> 00:13:39,356
-You can use an
officer of my clan

182
00:13:39,389 --> 00:13:41,722
whom I have greatly
trusted over the years.

183
00:13:41,756 --> 00:13:45,222
I want Rikuo to discern
with his own eyes,

184
00:13:45,256 --> 00:13:47,722
what his true intentions are.

185
00:13:47,756 --> 00:13:48,522
Any objections?

186
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:53,156
-No, of course not.

187
00:13:53,189 --> 00:13:57,022
[coughs]

188
00:13:57,056 --> 00:14:00,556
-In any case, even if I were
to go, I would be of little use

189
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:02,589
to the Master in this condition.

190
00:14:02,622 --> 00:14:05,922
But I have sworn my
loyalty to Master Rikuo,

191
00:14:05,956 --> 00:14:08,556
and I trust his judgment
unconditionally.

192
00:14:08,589 --> 00:14:11,556
-Hmm, you all got that, too?

193
00:14:14,689 --> 00:14:15,556
-Uh, yes?

194
00:14:27,422 --> 00:14:30,889
-Don't worry, you won't be
able to move for a while.

195
00:14:30,922 --> 00:14:34,189
-Master, your appearance.

196
00:14:34,222 --> 00:14:36,522
It's--

197
00:14:36,556 --> 00:14:39,256
-I've known this about myself.

198
00:14:39,289 --> 00:14:45,222
At night, I guess, when I
turn into this yokai form--

199
00:14:45,256 --> 00:14:47,089
-Master.

200
00:14:47,122 --> 00:14:49,522
-Rest, Yuki-Onna.

201
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:50,922
Let me take care of the rest.

202
00:15:06,122 --> 00:15:09,056
[grunting]

203
00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:11,856
-Yura, you were totally amazing!

204
00:15:11,889 --> 00:15:13,789
-Yeah, you really were!

205
00:15:13,822 --> 00:15:15,889
If you hadn't come in
to help, the two of us

206
00:15:15,922 --> 00:15:17,456
would have been goners!

207
00:15:17,489 --> 00:15:19,056
-That's not true.

208
00:15:19,089 --> 00:15:21,222
-Oh, and I think
those bird guys that

209
00:15:21,256 --> 00:15:23,889
swept in and took that creepy
little jerk away were amazing,

210
00:15:23,922 --> 00:15:24,556
too.

211
00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:25,922
-They were awesome!

212
00:15:25,956 --> 00:15:28,789
I mean, just the
fact that they exist.

213
00:15:28,822 --> 00:15:29,989
-Yeah that's for sure.

214
00:15:34,489 --> 00:15:35,956
I can't believe
this is happening!

215
00:15:35,989 --> 00:15:39,256
Don't tell me that you actually
saw a real yokai in action

216
00:15:39,289 --> 00:15:41,156
while I wasn't around
to see them too!

217
00:15:41,189 --> 00:15:43,056
[interposing voices]

218
00:15:43,089 --> 00:15:45,789
-I've got to see her,
let me see her now!

219
00:15:45,822 --> 00:15:47,589
-You guys are weird.

220
00:15:47,622 --> 00:15:49,389
-We haven't heard
from Nura or Kana.

221
00:15:49,422 --> 00:15:51,389
I wonder what happened to them.

222
00:15:51,422 --> 00:15:52,622
I hope they're OK.

223
00:15:52,656 --> 00:15:54,156
-I'm sure they're fine.

224
00:15:54,189 --> 00:15:55,956
There are those bird
people, after all.

225
00:16:06,122 --> 00:16:11,389
-Gee, I've been walking forever,
and I haven't seen anyone.

226
00:16:11,422 --> 00:16:13,289
Where's Kiyotsugu?

227
00:16:13,322 --> 00:16:14,956
And Oikawa, and Rikuo?

228
00:16:14,989 --> 00:16:15,556
[squawk]

229
00:16:15,589 --> 00:16:16,056
-No!

230
00:16:21,089 --> 00:16:22,056
-Oh, no!

231
00:16:34,022 --> 00:16:36,122
I hate this, I never
should have come here.

232
00:16:40,356 --> 00:16:42,689
This is stupid, what am I doing?

233
00:16:53,622 --> 00:16:55,356
Is there someone there?

234
00:17:10,789 --> 00:17:14,722
It's him , the one who saved me.

235
00:17:29,156 --> 00:17:30,089
You're that yokai.

236
00:17:50,422 --> 00:17:50,922
No--

237
00:18:03,756 --> 00:18:06,589
-Be careful, the
night of the new moon

238
00:18:06,622 --> 00:18:08,222
is too dark for humans.

239
00:18:17,822 --> 00:18:21,256
-Oikawa, is she hurt?

240
00:18:21,289 --> 00:18:23,056
-Perfect timing.

241
00:18:23,089 --> 00:18:26,322
Can you take care of her for me?

242
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:28,989
I have somewhere I must go.

243
00:18:29,022 --> 00:18:30,456
-Uh, yes.

244
00:18:38,422 --> 00:18:40,856
These are Rikuo's.

245
00:18:40,889 --> 00:18:42,222
Where is he?

246
00:18:42,256 --> 00:18:44,756
-Don't worry about
him, but you'd better

247
00:18:44,789 --> 00:18:46,222
hurry back to the inn.

248
00:18:52,056 --> 00:18:53,989
Go.

249
00:18:54,022 --> 00:18:55,456
The clouds are
looking rather nasty.

250
00:19:02,956 --> 00:19:04,989
Don't worry, Kana.

251
00:19:05,022 --> 00:19:07,789
If you're scared,
close your eyes.

252
00:19:07,822 --> 00:19:13,489
-Wait a minute, how
do you know my name?

253
00:19:13,522 --> 00:19:17,756
-I've known it for a long time.

254
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:18,589
-For a long time?

255
00:19:27,322 --> 00:19:28,289
Oh, wait!

256
00:19:39,289 --> 00:19:42,256
KANA (VOICEOVER): Why?

257
00:19:42,289 --> 00:19:45,589
Why am I feeling nostalgic?

258
00:20:43,122 --> 00:20:46,056
-Tell me what's on
your mind, Gyuki.

259
00:20:54,756 --> 00:20:56,389
-So you've come.

260
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:57,322
After all.

261
00:21:11,556 --> 00:21:14,656
-Is it getting too
hot for you, father?

262
00:21:14,689 --> 00:21:16,422
-I'm fine, just keep going.

263
00:21:22,589 --> 00:21:27,022
-I see, it seems you really do
have the Supreme Commander's

264
00:21:27,056 --> 00:21:32,122
blood in you, to appear
wherever you like so elusively.

265
00:21:32,156 --> 00:21:33,589
-Hmph.

266
00:21:33,622 --> 00:21:35,056
Elusively, huh?

267
00:23:38,969 --> 00:23:40,835
-Yura, you live alone.

268
00:23:40,869 --> 00:23:42,302
So what do you do
for your meals?

269
00:23:42,335 --> 00:23:45,002
-I go to the convenience
store, the convenience store,

270
00:23:45,035 --> 00:23:46,469
and the convenience store.

271
00:23:46,502 --> 00:23:48,702
-Well, would you like to
come over for dinner tonight?

272
00:23:48,735 --> 00:23:50,302
-Next time,
