NARRATOR: In days of
old, people feared Yokai.

00:00:13,533 --> 00:00:16,433
The one who stood at the helm
and led the Night Parade of 100

3
00:00:16,466 --> 00:00:23,066
Demons was known as the
supreme commander of the Yokai.

4
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:28,500
They had another name for
him, the Lord the Pandemonium,

5
00:00:28,533 --> 00:00:31,233
Nurarihyon.

[theme music]

7
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:12,028
-What was that sound?

8
00:02:12,062 --> 00:02:13,562
It was awfully loud.

9
00:02:13,595 --> 00:02:14,695
Saburo Neko?

10
00:02:14,728 --> 00:02:16,728
What happened to you?

11
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:17,928
-Huh?

12
00:02:17,962 --> 00:02:20,395
Must be from that
last gust of wind.

13
00:02:20,428 --> 00:02:21,562
Anyway, I'm fine.

14
00:02:21,595 --> 00:02:23,595
My clothes just got
a little torn up.

15
00:02:23,628 --> 00:02:24,928
-I see.

16
00:02:24,962 --> 00:02:25,928
-I'm going to go change.

17
00:02:39,562 --> 00:02:41,995
Supreme commander!

18
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:44,362
Master!

19
00:02:44,395 --> 00:02:45,728
-Keep it down, will ya?

20
00:02:45,762 --> 00:02:46,928
What's this all about?

21
00:02:46,962 --> 00:02:48,728
-Something really
strange has happened over

22
00:02:48,762 --> 00:02:50,695
at Bakeneko Alley.

23
00:02:50,728 --> 00:02:51,662
-Oh, man.

24
00:02:51,695 --> 00:02:52,962
There's always
something going on.

25
00:02:52,995 --> 00:02:53,462
Hm?

26
00:02:59,228 --> 00:03:02,495
I smell-- poison?

27
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,395
There's a nasty wind blowing.

00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:17,362
-Here you go.

31
00:03:17,395 --> 00:03:17,836
Here.

32
00:03:21,369 --> 00:03:24,669
-Another incident over
at Bakeneko Alley?

33
00:03:24,703 --> 00:03:25,703
-Yes.

34
00:03:25,736 --> 00:03:27,969
It's probably some
petty Yokai trying

35
00:03:28,003 --> 00:03:30,003
to imitate the Kyuso clan.

36
00:03:30,036 --> 00:03:31,803
There's no need for concern.

37
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:34,536
-I sincerely hope so.

38
00:03:34,569 --> 00:03:36,703
-Say, supreme
commander, would you

39
00:03:36,736 --> 00:03:39,536
consider letting me
handle this case?

40
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:40,736
-What?

41
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:42,569
-I'd like to get to the
bottom of this personally.

42
00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:47,236
-No.

43
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:48,203
That won't be necessary.

44
00:03:48,236 --> 00:03:51,269
Let the young ones
handle this case.

45
00:03:51,303 --> 00:03:54,103
-Seeing Master Rikuo declare
that he would take over

46
00:03:54,136 --> 00:03:56,969
as the third heir
yesterday brought back

47
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:59,303
memories of your younger days.

48
00:03:59,336 --> 00:04:03,436
And it made me want to
stir things up a bit.

49
00:04:03,469 --> 00:04:06,603
It's a little too soon to write
me off as a retired old geezer,

50
00:04:06,636 --> 00:04:08,003
don't you think?

51
00:04:08,036 --> 00:04:09,903
-Do as you please.

52
00:04:09,936 --> 00:04:14,636
But don't come crying
if something goes wrong.

53
00:04:14,669 --> 00:04:17,769
-I'll bring over some fresh
green tea leaves when I'm done.

54
00:04:17,803 --> 00:04:18,869
We'll enjoy them together.

55
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,536
-Wait.

56
00:04:23,569 --> 00:04:26,136
Don't forget the sweets
to go with the tea.

57
00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:28,703
-I know.

58
00:04:28,736 --> 00:04:29,969
-I'll bring your Kofuku Manju.

59
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:39,436
-Oh, Hihi.

60
00:04:39,469 --> 00:04:40,403
You leaving already?

61
00:04:40,436 --> 00:04:41,603
-Yes.

62
00:04:41,636 --> 00:04:44,536
My, you look just like an
ordinary kid like that.

63
00:04:47,769 --> 00:04:48,236
-Huh?

64
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:06,269
-Ryota Neko, tell
us what you know.

65
00:05:06,303 --> 00:05:08,036
-They had come
here to investigate

66
00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:08,903
yesterday's incident.

67
00:05:13,169 --> 00:05:16,803
-It's hard to believe the
great Yokai Lord Hihi could

68
00:05:16,836 --> 00:05:19,069
be killed so easily,
along with his men.

69
00:05:22,003 --> 00:05:24,269
-But look at the clean
cut of this slash.

70
00:05:24,303 --> 00:05:27,236
-A kill like this requires
extraordinary skill

71
00:05:27,269 --> 00:05:29,969
and an extremely sharp blade.

72
00:05:30,003 --> 00:05:31,369
-Or maybe--

73
00:05:31,403 --> 00:05:32,236
-What is it?

74
00:05:32,269 --> 00:05:35,336
-The wind.

75
00:05:35,369 --> 00:05:37,569
There was a tremendous
gust of wind,

76
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:40,236
and when I went
outside to check,

77
00:05:40,269 --> 00:05:43,203
I saw Saburo Neko's
clothes in tatters,

78
00:05:43,236 --> 00:05:46,069
as though he had gone
through a shredder.

79
00:05:46,103 --> 00:05:48,736
At first he seemed
fine, but then he

80
00:05:48,769 --> 00:05:52,469
collapsed, and has yet
to regain consciousness!

81
00:05:52,503 --> 00:05:54,969
-This is obviously
the work of outsiders.

82
00:05:55,003 --> 00:05:58,603
-An enemy force,
totally unknown to us.

83
00:05:58,636 --> 00:06:00,703
-Yes, and they have
boldly challenged

84
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:03,136
the supremacy of the Nura clan.

85
00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:04,736
-We mustn't waste any time.

86
00:06:04,769 --> 00:06:05,936
Let's go.

87
00:06:05,969 --> 00:06:07,003
Take care of the rest.

88
00:06:07,036 --> 00:06:08,103
-Right.

89
00:06:08,136 --> 00:06:10,103
We must notify the main
family immediately.

90
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:11,636
-This is an emergency!

91
00:06:11,669 --> 00:06:14,036
-Have Dad place the top
officials under heavy guard.

92
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:14,536
Hurry!

93
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:29,936
-Master.

94
00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:31,636
-We just heard what
happened to Lord Hihi.

95
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:39,369
-Right after I make up my
mind to become the third heir,

96
00:06:39,403 --> 00:06:42,303
something terrible like
this had to happen.

97
00:06:42,336 --> 00:06:42,803
-Master.

98
00:06:46,769 --> 00:06:48,803
-Why would anyone attack Hihi?

99
00:06:53,703 --> 00:06:55,136
SASAMI: Master!

100
00:06:55,169 --> 00:06:55,636
Master!

101
00:06:58,636 --> 00:06:59,836
Master.

102
00:06:59,869 --> 00:07:01,569
My father calls for you.

103
00:07:01,603 --> 00:07:03,769
-Karasu Tengu does?

104
00:07:03,803 --> 00:07:04,803
-Yes.

105
00:07:04,836 --> 00:07:07,603
And also, he wants
you two, as well.

106
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:09,536
-Increase my bodyguards?

107
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:11,669
-What do you mean,
he needs more guards?

108
00:07:11,703 --> 00:07:14,869
It's our duty to guard Master
Rikuo, and it always has been!

109
00:07:14,903 --> 00:07:16,236
-Yeah, he's right.

110
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,269
Are you insinuating that
we're not strong enough?

111
00:07:18,303 --> 00:07:19,903
-Don't the two of
you care at all

112
00:07:19,936 --> 00:07:22,903
if something terrible
happens to Master Rikuo?

113
00:07:22,936 --> 00:07:24,369
-Of course we do.

114
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:24,969
-We care!

115
00:07:25,003 --> 00:07:26,669
But--

116
00:07:26,703 --> 00:07:29,669
-I'm satisfied with
the way things are.

117
00:07:29,703 --> 00:07:30,869
-No, master!

118
00:07:30,903 --> 00:07:33,303
The fact is you are the
irreplaceable third heir

119
00:07:33,336 --> 00:07:34,536
of the Nura clan.

120
00:07:34,569 --> 00:07:36,969
If something happened to
you, it would be disastrous.

121
00:07:37,003 --> 00:07:38,669
Until we learn
who attacked Hihi,

122
00:07:38,703 --> 00:07:41,636
there will be six bodyguards
assigned to you at all times.

123
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,003
This is my final decision!

124
00:07:55,336 --> 00:07:56,803
-Huh?

125
00:07:56,836 --> 00:07:59,136
Kubinashi?

126
00:07:59,169 --> 00:08:02,303
His head isn't moving.

127
00:08:02,336 --> 00:08:05,736
Is that Kappa?

128
00:08:05,769 --> 00:08:07,703
His webs are showing.

129
00:08:07,736 --> 00:08:08,503
Kejoro?

130
00:08:08,536 --> 00:08:09,203
-Oh, my.

131
00:08:09,236 --> 00:08:10,736
It's so cramped in here.

132
00:08:10,769 --> 00:08:12,769
-Why's she in a
school girl's uniform?

133
00:08:12,803 --> 00:08:13,603
Wait.

134
00:08:13,636 --> 00:08:17,003
Wasn't there one more bodyguard?

135
00:08:17,036 --> 00:08:18,236
KUROTABO (VOICEOVER): Fools.

136
00:08:18,269 --> 00:08:21,436
Don't they know how to
blend in with humans?

137
00:08:21,469 --> 00:08:22,803
Take a good look at me.

138
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,269
I blend in perfectly.

139
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:28,336
I look like a
handsome businessman.

140
00:08:28,369 --> 00:08:29,369
-Shoot!

141
00:08:29,403 --> 00:08:30,503
I'm getting off!

142
00:08:30,536 --> 00:08:32,969
[shouting]

143
00:08:33,003 --> 00:08:34,536
-So who's the last one?

144
00:08:34,569 --> 00:08:36,903
-It's supposed to
be Kurotabo, but--

145
00:08:36,936 --> 00:08:39,669
-That guys probably off
playing hooky somewhere.

146
00:08:39,703 --> 00:08:40,169
-Master!

147
00:08:53,369 --> 00:08:54,103
-Stop it!

148
00:08:54,136 --> 00:08:55,736
-But I have to follow you.

149
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:57,369
I'm your bodyguard.

150
00:08:57,403 --> 00:08:59,036
-I said I don't need one!

151
00:08:59,069 --> 00:09:01,569
I hate when people follow
me around like that.

152
00:09:01,603 --> 00:09:03,369
[coughing]

153
00:09:03,403 --> 00:09:04,869
-Lord Zen?

154
00:09:04,903 --> 00:09:06,303
-What is this?

155
00:09:06,336 --> 00:09:08,903
This runt is really
my bodyguard?

156
00:09:08,936 --> 00:09:13,069
-I may be small, but
I have Yokai power.

157
00:09:13,103 --> 00:09:14,869
-Watch it!

158
00:09:14,903 --> 00:09:15,436
Hot!

159
00:09:15,469 --> 00:09:18,236
Hot, hot, hot!

160
00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:19,269
Cold!

161
00:09:19,303 --> 00:09:20,336
-Oh, wow.

162
00:09:20,369 --> 00:09:21,736
I wonder who we're
going to be guarding?

163
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,769
I hope it's somebody important.

164
00:09:23,803 --> 00:09:25,269
-What are you, an idiot?

165
00:09:25,303 --> 00:09:27,069
We're no more than
hostages around here.

166
00:09:27,103 --> 00:09:28,536
Why are you excited?

167
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:31,903
-Everyone else is, and it's fun.

168
00:09:31,936 --> 00:09:32,736
-Forget I asked.

169
00:09:36,069 --> 00:09:36,669
-Ow!

170
00:09:36,703 --> 00:09:37,736
Why'd you hit me?

171
00:09:37,769 --> 00:09:40,469
-I only guard big
shots, or none at all.

172
00:09:40,503 --> 00:09:43,303
-We're going to have to assign
someone extra strong to protect

173
00:09:43,336 --> 00:09:44,836
you, supreme commander.

174
00:09:44,869 --> 00:09:47,503
-There's no need
for such a fuss.

175
00:09:47,536 --> 00:09:48,036
-You there!

176
00:09:48,069 --> 00:09:49,103
Gozu, Mezu.

177
00:09:49,136 --> 00:09:51,736
I'm putting you to
work right away.

178
00:09:51,769 --> 00:09:53,003
-Yeah!

179
00:09:53,036 --> 00:09:55,736
-You two are going
to be bodyguards.

180
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:57,336
-For that guy?

181
00:09:57,369 --> 00:09:58,903
-That guy, you say?

182
00:09:58,936 --> 00:10:01,603
How dare you refer to
him in that manner.

183
00:10:01,636 --> 00:10:05,269
This Yokai here is-- who, me?

184
00:10:05,303 --> 00:10:06,736
-He's gone!

185
00:10:06,769 --> 00:10:08,036
Why, Sundokuchi?

186
00:10:08,069 --> 00:10:09,069
Supreme commander?

187
00:10:09,103 --> 00:10:11,736
Supreme commander,
where are you?

188
00:10:11,769 --> 00:10:13,403
-This is stupid.

189
00:10:13,436 --> 00:10:14,569
-That Karasu Tengu.

190
00:10:14,603 --> 00:10:17,169
It's his fault Rikuo is
so damned overprotected.

191
00:10:20,303 --> 00:10:21,269
-Look at that.

192
00:10:21,303 --> 00:10:23,269
When did they put
this building up?

193
00:10:23,303 --> 00:10:24,803
It's awfully big.

194
00:10:29,869 --> 00:10:31,503
-Except it lacks beauty.

195
00:10:31,536 --> 00:10:35,436
Those humans just don't get it.

196
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:37,769
[shriek]

197
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:40,469
-Ah, I take that back.

198
00:10:40,503 --> 00:10:42,969
Tall buildings aren't
bad, after all.

199
00:10:43,003 --> 00:10:44,636
-Supreme commander.

200
00:10:44,669 --> 00:10:47,869
-It's almost complete.

201
00:10:47,903 --> 00:10:51,469
We will make this
our sacred ground.

202
00:10:51,503 --> 00:10:55,469
Now we can kill Nurarihyon, the
supreme commander of the Nura

203
00:10:55,503 --> 00:10:55,969
clan.

204
00:11:06,469 --> 00:11:07,369
-Rikuo.

205
00:11:07,403 --> 00:11:08,303
-Huh?

206
00:11:08,336 --> 00:11:09,469
-We're gonna be
late for our club.

207
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:10,269
Let's hurry.

208
00:11:13,369 --> 00:11:15,469
I'm sorry about the other day.

209
00:11:15,503 --> 00:11:19,203
I put you on the spot by asking
so many questions about him.

210
00:11:19,236 --> 00:11:20,936
-Don't worry about it.

211
00:11:20,969 --> 00:11:22,936
-You seem so distracted today.

212
00:11:22,969 --> 00:11:24,303
-Huh?

213
00:11:24,336 --> 00:11:26,269
-You just sat there quietly
in class the whole time today,

214
00:11:26,303 --> 00:11:28,103
and you haven't even
cracked a smile.

215
00:11:28,136 --> 00:11:30,169
Is something wrong, Rikuo?

216
00:11:30,203 --> 00:11:33,136
-No, um, it's nothing.

217
00:11:33,169 --> 00:11:36,669
I really didn't get much
sleep last night, that's all.

218
00:11:36,703 --> 00:11:38,003
-I hope that's it.

219
00:11:38,036 --> 00:11:39,703
You're always so
upbeat and positive,

220
00:11:39,736 --> 00:11:43,136
I just get worried when
you're looking down like this.

221
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,436
RIKUO (VOICEOVER): She's right.

222
00:11:45,469 --> 00:11:49,803
If I'm down, I'll only
make everyone worry.

223
00:11:49,836 --> 00:11:56,303
This is the time when I have
to be strong as the third heir.

224
00:11:56,336 --> 00:11:58,469
-Uh, Rikuo?

225
00:11:58,503 --> 00:12:00,469
-I really appreciate
you worrying so much

226
00:12:00,503 --> 00:12:02,803
about me, Kana, but
I'm perfectly OK.

227
00:12:02,836 --> 00:12:03,303
Really.

228
00:12:06,369 --> 00:12:08,869
-Who Wants the
strawberry flavored one?

229
00:12:08,903 --> 00:12:09,369
-I do!

230
00:12:09,403 --> 00:12:09,903
-I do!

231
00:12:09,936 --> 00:12:10,385
-Me, me, me!

232
00:12:33,046 --> 00:12:34,346
-Supreme commander.

233
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:38,512
Looks like you got lots and
lots of sweets again today.

234
00:12:38,546 --> 00:12:40,946
-There's plenty for
you too, Natto Kozou.

235
00:12:40,979 --> 00:12:43,846
I got some old lady
Uzami's disgusting candy,

236
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:48,546
bean jam buns, rice
crackers, and Kofuku Manju.

237
00:12:48,579 --> 00:12:50,179
-I'll bring your
favorite Kofuku Manju.

238
00:12:55,146 --> 00:12:59,579
-It's so hard to believe
that he is really gone.

239
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,079
That damned fool.

240
00:13:02,112 --> 00:13:04,546
-Supreme Commander.

241
00:13:04,579 --> 00:13:06,879
I wish I could find
some way to console you

242
00:13:06,912 --> 00:13:09,346
about Lord Hihi's passing.

243
00:13:09,379 --> 00:13:10,246
He's gone!

244
00:13:15,479 --> 00:13:16,779
Supreme Commander.

245
00:13:16,812 --> 00:13:20,479
You're not gonna get anything
even if you line up there.

246
00:13:20,512 --> 00:13:20,979
-Really?

247
00:13:21,012 --> 00:13:21,479
Why?

248
00:13:25,312 --> 00:13:31,346
That girl over there
is the Onmyoji.

249
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:32,812
YURA (VOICEOVER):
This is a battle.

250
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:37,712
If I lose, I won't have
anything for dinner tonight.

251
00:13:37,746 --> 00:13:40,246
-We'll begin our limited
time sale right now.

252
00:13:46,212 --> 00:13:47,179
-Ah!

253
00:13:47,212 --> 00:13:48,146
Which is a better deal?

254
00:13:48,179 --> 00:13:49,646
I can't tell.

255
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:52,146
Oh, this is so hard!

256
00:13:55,146 --> 00:13:57,112
There's no time
to think about it.

257
00:14:00,646 --> 00:14:01,612
I lost.

258
00:14:01,646 --> 00:14:02,979
-Thank you very much.

259
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:08,379
-Mad rush, wasn't it?

260
00:14:08,412 --> 00:14:09,212
-Wait.

261
00:14:09,246 --> 00:14:11,112
Aren't you Nura's grandfather?

262
00:14:15,012 --> 00:14:15,979
-Mm.

263
00:14:16,012 --> 00:14:17,612
I see.

264
00:14:17,646 --> 00:14:19,946
So, you actually
came to Tokyo alone

265
00:14:19,979 --> 00:14:21,912
to train and become
a great Onmyoji?

266
00:14:21,946 --> 00:14:22,546
Admirable.

267
00:14:22,579 --> 00:14:24,446
-No, not at all.

268
00:14:27,346 --> 00:14:31,279
-However, the Keikain
are very famous Onmyoji.

269
00:14:31,312 --> 00:14:34,179
Isn't it rather harsh of
them to make you do this?

270
00:14:34,212 --> 00:14:34,712
-No.

271
00:14:34,746 --> 00:14:36,612
It's OK.

272
00:14:36,646 --> 00:14:37,446
They didn't make me.

273
00:14:37,479 --> 00:14:38,612
I chose to do this.

274
00:14:41,546 --> 00:14:43,812
I'm going to stay
motivated, and one day

275
00:14:43,846 --> 00:14:46,679
defeat the great
Nurarihyon, the Yokai leader

276
00:14:46,712 --> 00:14:49,146
who's said to
reside in this town.

277
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:49,879
-Ah.

278
00:14:49,912 --> 00:14:52,212
You are very ambitious.

279
00:14:52,246 --> 00:14:53,779
-This is such a weird situation.

280
00:14:59,312 --> 00:15:01,379
-Well, that was the plan.

281
00:15:01,412 --> 00:15:01,879
-Hm?

282
00:15:04,546 --> 00:15:07,579
-But after I arrived
here, I lost my touch.

283
00:15:07,612 --> 00:15:10,312
I totally misread the
presence of Yokai,

284
00:15:10,346 --> 00:15:12,912
I got myself captured while
trying to protect people

285
00:15:12,946 --> 00:15:16,179
from Yokai, and on top of that--

286
00:15:16,212 --> 00:15:17,112
-Hm?

287
00:15:17,146 --> 00:15:18,512
YURA (VOICEOVER):
I can't say it.

288
00:15:18,546 --> 00:15:21,646
To admit being saved by a Yokai
is a disgrace for an Onmyoji.

289
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:22,912
-What's the matter?

290
00:15:22,946 --> 00:15:23,612
-Oh, don't worry.

291
00:15:23,646 --> 00:15:24,679
It's nothing, really.

292
00:15:30,646 --> 00:15:32,312
YURA (VOICEOVER):
Why did that Yokai

293
00:15:32,346 --> 00:15:34,679
come to our rescue like that?

294
00:15:34,712 --> 00:15:36,479
-Can I ask you something?

295
00:15:36,512 --> 00:15:38,512
Yokai are evil
creatures, aren't they?

296
00:15:38,546 --> 00:15:40,179
-Why do you ask?

297
00:15:40,212 --> 00:15:41,412
-Yokai are evil.

298
00:15:41,446 --> 00:15:43,712
I was taught that and fought
against them until now.

299
00:15:43,746 --> 00:15:46,679
But a lot of things have
happened since I came here.

300
00:15:53,612 --> 00:15:56,246
And I've become-- I
don't know-- confused.

301
00:15:59,946 --> 00:16:02,012
-There's really no need
to dwell over it, my dear.

302
00:16:02,046 --> 00:16:04,712
Yokai are evil creatures.

303
00:16:04,746 --> 00:16:07,379
I mean, they are what
they are, after all.

304
00:16:07,412 --> 00:16:08,679
-Mr. Nura.

305
00:16:08,712 --> 00:16:10,612
You're absolutely right.

306
00:16:10,646 --> 00:16:12,312
Yokai are Yokai.

307
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:14,646
Their mere existence
is terrible.

308
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:16,779
I mean, what's there
to doubt, right?

309
00:16:16,812 --> 00:16:17,546
-Yes.

310
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:19,246
There's nothing to doubt.

311
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,212
-Thank you so much, Mr. Nura.

312
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:24,179
I feel a lot better after
talking to you like this.

313
00:16:24,212 --> 00:16:25,712
-Well, you're doing your best.

314
00:16:25,746 --> 00:16:26,779
-Supreme Commander.

315
00:16:26,812 --> 00:16:28,712
What are you doing
encouraging an Onmyoji?

316
00:16:31,546 --> 00:16:33,646
-You know, if you're
ever troubled by Yokai,

317
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:35,712
please don't
hesitate to tell me.

318
00:16:35,746 --> 00:16:37,879
I'll come and help
you, I promise.

319
00:16:37,912 --> 00:16:38,712
-Thank you.

320
00:16:38,746 --> 00:16:41,146
Keep an eye on Rikuo too, OK?

321
00:16:41,179 --> 00:16:42,579
-Of course.

322
00:16:42,612 --> 00:16:45,779
I have a feeling you and I are
going to become good friends.

323
00:16:45,812 --> 00:16:47,512
-Well, I'm happy
to hear that, dear.

324
00:16:56,246 --> 00:16:58,946
-What was that strange wind?

325
00:16:58,979 --> 00:17:01,512
-It's probably an eddy
created by the closeness

326
00:17:01,546 --> 00:17:02,212
of the buildings.

327
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,112
-Mr. Nura, look out!

328
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:13,512
-Shima and Yura are not coming?

329
00:17:22,412 --> 00:17:22,946
-All right!

330
00:17:22,979 --> 00:17:23,946
It's all done!

331
00:17:23,979 --> 00:17:25,412
-Kiyotsugu, you made
something again?

332
00:17:25,446 --> 00:17:25,894
-Yep.

333
00:17:25,928 --> 00:17:26,694
Here.

334
00:17:26,728 --> 00:17:27,661
Take a look for yourself.

335
00:17:27,694 --> 00:17:28,994
-A map of Japan?

336
00:17:29,028 --> 00:17:30,594
KIYOTSUGU: Not exactly.

337
00:17:30,628 --> 00:17:32,894
This is a graph showing
the areas in Japan that

338
00:17:32,928 --> 00:17:34,728
have had Yokai
sightings, and I've

339
00:17:34,761 --> 00:17:37,828
included all data about
Yokai throughout the country.

340
00:17:37,861 --> 00:17:41,028
-Looking at this graph, there
seems to be a lot in the west,

341
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:43,528
especially in Kyoto and Shikoku.

342
00:17:43,561 --> 00:17:44,728
-That's right.

343
00:17:44,761 --> 00:17:46,628
Shikoku has the largest
number of Yokai sightings

344
00:17:46,661 --> 00:17:47,761
in the country.

345
00:17:47,794 --> 00:17:49,561
I mean, you could easily
call it one big Yokai

346
00:17:49,594 --> 00:17:51,761
kingdom if you wanted.

347
00:17:51,794 --> 00:17:53,194
-I figured as much.

348
00:17:53,228 --> 00:17:54,394
There are so many.

349
00:17:54,428 --> 00:17:55,461
-Now for the best part.

350
00:17:55,494 --> 00:17:59,261
Using all the data I
collected, I made this.

351
00:17:59,294 --> 00:18:00,528
-Onmyoji what?

352
00:18:00,561 --> 00:18:02,728
KIYOTSUGU: It's a game
featuring the Onmyoji girl that

353
00:18:02,761 --> 00:18:04,861
covers all the Yokai data
in Japan as you play.

354
00:18:04,894 --> 00:18:07,361
We can have fun and
learn about Yokai too.

355
00:18:07,394 --> 00:18:10,928
It's killing two
birds with one stone!

356
00:18:10,961 --> 00:18:12,128
-Wow.

357
00:18:12,161 --> 00:18:13,828
You really do like Yokai,
don't you, Kiyotsugu?

358
00:18:13,861 --> 00:18:15,494
-More like obsessed with it.

359
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:18,228
Can you show me what
Yuki Onna looks like?

360
00:18:18,261 --> 00:18:20,728
-I wonder if the Yokai I'm
looking for is in here?

361
00:18:26,628 --> 00:18:28,494
-Are you all right, Mr. Nura?

362
00:18:28,528 --> 00:18:29,861
-Yeah.

363
00:18:29,894 --> 00:18:30,861
-Oh, so you [inaudible].

364
00:18:34,828 --> 00:18:36,828
You have some good reflexes.

365
00:18:39,928 --> 00:18:41,528
-Who is that fellow?

366
00:18:41,561 --> 00:18:44,061
-Kamaitachi, the Yokai
that manipulates wind?

367
00:18:44,094 --> 00:18:47,161
-You know a lot about
Yokai, Mr. Nura.

368
00:18:47,194 --> 00:18:48,494
-Oh yes, well--

369
00:18:48,528 --> 00:18:50,594
-But that's not
Kamaitachi over there.

370
00:18:50,628 --> 00:18:51,894
It's someone else.

371
00:18:51,928 --> 00:18:54,428
I've seen him in one
of the books I studied.

372
00:18:54,461 --> 00:18:56,261
This one is a wind
Yokai that makes

373
00:18:56,294 --> 00:18:58,494
a sharp sound like a whip.

374
00:18:58,528 --> 00:19:00,794
This whipping wind is
poisonous, and if you

375
00:19:00,828 --> 00:19:03,861
sustain a deep wound,
it can kill you.

376
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:06,894
Its one of the Yokai found
in Shikoku, named Muchi.

377
00:19:11,394 --> 00:19:13,328
Mr. Nura, run away!

378
00:19:25,761 --> 00:19:26,428
-Karasu Tengu?

379
00:19:26,461 --> 00:19:27,261
-Supreme Commander!

380
00:19:27,294 --> 00:19:30,528
Where have you run off to?

381
00:19:30,561 --> 00:19:32,894
I wonder if there's more
trouble in the clan again.

382
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:41,594
Wind formation,
striking sand whip!

383
00:19:41,628 --> 00:19:43,894
-Look out, Mr. Nura!

384
00:19:43,928 --> 00:19:45,294
-Hey.

385
00:19:45,328 --> 00:19:46,828
Never mind about me.

386
00:19:46,861 --> 00:19:48,294
-Can't do that!

387
00:19:48,328 --> 00:19:50,661
YURA (VOICEOVER): I can't
protect him like this.

388
00:19:50,694 --> 00:19:51,228
-Mr. Nura.

389
00:19:51,261 --> 00:19:52,628
Hang onto this!

390
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:57,861
Rokuson!

391
00:19:57,894 --> 00:19:58,394
-A Shikigami?

392
00:20:03,228 --> 00:20:04,161
-Get him!

393
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:14,861
-Thank you for your
help, young girl.

394
00:20:14,894 --> 00:20:16,861
-Supreme Commander!

395
00:20:16,894 --> 00:20:18,694
-She may be a
Keikain clan Onmyoji,

396
00:20:18,728 --> 00:20:21,828
but she is clearly outnumbered.

397
00:20:21,861 --> 00:20:24,461
-Now you're going to
be the first to die.

398
00:20:33,094 --> 00:20:36,494
-That's what she gets for
using a Shikigami to help me.

399
00:20:36,528 --> 00:20:38,928
-No, Supreme Commander, don't!

400
00:20:38,961 --> 00:20:41,361
You can't reveal your
true self to her!

401
00:20:41,394 --> 00:20:41,861
-Huh?

402
00:20:48,694 --> 00:20:49,194
-Hm?

403
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:56,061
-Good.

404
00:20:56,094 --> 00:20:58,628
I'm finally free
of my heavy burden.

405
00:21:05,994 --> 00:21:07,961
-Three Shinigami?

406
00:21:07,994 --> 00:21:08,894
Unbelievable.

407
00:21:08,928 --> 00:21:11,894
To summon this many at her age.

408
00:21:11,928 --> 00:21:13,594
She has amazing skills.

409
00:21:13,628 --> 00:21:16,994
-Tanro, Go and devour
every one of them!

410
00:21:20,961 --> 00:21:22,894
Rentei!

411
00:21:22,928 --> 00:21:26,094
A fourth one?

412
00:21:26,128 --> 00:21:27,494
-Shikigami convert!

413
00:21:30,994 --> 00:21:32,928
-Jinshiki Synthesis!

414
00:21:36,394 --> 00:21:39,294
Keikain style, Onmyo jutsu!

415
00:21:39,328 --> 00:21:41,261
Banish to the Abyss, Yura Max!

416
00:21:51,161 --> 00:21:54,194
Did you think a young girl
like me was easy to defeat?

417
00:21:54,228 --> 00:21:57,028
NARRATOR: Standing strong
in the face of evil.

418
00:21:57,061 --> 00:21:59,461
Will the Onmyoji
girl's power put an end

419
00:21:59,494 --> 00:22:01,728
to the wind Yokai
Muchi's bloodlust?

420
00:22:07,889 --> 00:22:10,555
[theme music]

421
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,807
RIKUO: Say, Kubinashi,
are you a heartbreaker?

422
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,840
KUBINASHI: Huh?

423
00:23:41,874 --> 00:23:43,407
RIKUO: Kejoro said
that's what you are.

424
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,340
KUBINASHI: Ah, did she?

425
00:23:45,374 --> 00:23:47,407
Actually, I think that's
more like you, Master.

426
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,674
RIKUO: Huh?

427
00:23:48,707 --> 00:23:52,607
NARRATOR: Next time, Tamazuki
and the Seven Shadows.
