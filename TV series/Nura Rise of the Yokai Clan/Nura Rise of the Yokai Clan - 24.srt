1
00:00:08,966 --> 00:00:13,133
-In days of old,
people feared Yokai.

2
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:15,966
The one who stood at the helm
and led the Night Parade of 100

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,933
Demons was known as the
supreme commander of the Yokai.

4
00:00:22,966 --> 00:00:25,966
They had another name
for him, the Lord

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,633
of Pandemonium, Nurarihyon.

00:02:04,241 --> 00:02:05,674
[horn]

8
00:02:11,674 --> 00:02:14,841
-I might not make it
in time to stop you.

9
00:02:14,874 --> 00:02:16,641
Huh, Tamazuki?

10
00:02:16,674 --> 00:02:17,141
-Hm?

11
00:02:24,141 --> 00:02:25,607
GIRL (VOICEOVER):
The Devil's Blade.

12
00:02:28,641 --> 00:02:31,941
-I sense the presence of Yokai.

13
00:02:31,974 --> 00:02:35,374
A whole lot of them.

14
00:02:35,407 --> 00:02:36,374
KANA: Wait!

15
00:02:36,407 --> 00:02:37,341
Yura!

16
00:02:37,374 --> 00:02:39,207
-You don't need to come, Ienaga.

17
00:02:39,241 --> 00:02:39,841
It's dangerous.

18
00:03:08,407 --> 00:03:09,641
[groan]

19
00:03:12,374 --> 00:03:12,974
-There.

20
00:03:13,007 --> 00:03:14,074
That should do it.

21
00:03:14,107 --> 00:03:15,341
SHOEI: Take care of these guys!

22
00:03:18,241 --> 00:03:20,841
You need to tend to
them quickly, OK?

23
00:03:20,874 --> 00:03:21,941
-Shoei.

24
00:03:21,974 --> 00:03:22,741
What about you?

25
00:03:22,774 --> 00:03:23,941
Are you all right?

26
00:03:23,974 --> 00:03:25,241
-I'm fine.

27
00:03:25,274 --> 00:03:26,807
Hurry up and see to them.

28
00:03:26,841 --> 00:03:30,507
-I just can't believe that
even Gozumaru and Mezumaru have

29
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:32,907
been wounded badly like this.

30
00:03:32,941 --> 00:03:35,707
-Stop running and
fight me, Kappa!

31
00:03:35,741 --> 00:03:38,441
-What, so I can make this
little game easier for you?

32
00:03:38,474 --> 00:03:39,407
Forget it!

33
00:03:43,907 --> 00:03:47,307
-Aotabo, you and I are gonna
settle our little score today,

34
00:03:47,341 --> 00:03:49,974
once and for all.

35
00:03:50,007 --> 00:03:53,074
Well, it seems like I am
the stronger one here.

36
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:54,274
Wouldn't you agree?

37
00:03:58,074 --> 00:04:00,107
Ha ha ha ha ha!

38
00:04:00,141 --> 00:04:02,741
-He took out the Nura
clan's strike team leader!

39
00:04:02,774 --> 00:04:05,241
-I guess I just proved
that I'm the strongest

40
00:04:05,274 --> 00:04:07,941
Yokai in all of Japan!

41
00:04:07,974 --> 00:04:09,207
-Prepare to die!

42
00:04:11,741 --> 00:04:14,174
-There's nowhere left
for you to run now!

43
00:04:14,207 --> 00:04:15,807
-I wasn't running away.

44
00:04:15,841 --> 00:04:19,141
I was looking for more water
to create a bigger attack.

45
00:04:19,174 --> 00:04:19,907
Like this!

46
00:04:25,774 --> 00:04:29,707
Kappa Ninja Special,
Mizuchi Ball!

47
00:04:29,741 --> 00:04:30,207
Yeah!

48
00:04:35,574 --> 00:04:38,041
[scream]

49
00:04:38,074 --> 00:04:40,574
-No one bailed
you out this time.

50
00:04:40,607 --> 00:04:41,474
Heh, heh.

51
00:04:41,507 --> 00:04:42,841
That was pretty fun.

52
00:04:42,874 --> 00:04:44,207
[laughter]

53
00:04:44,241 --> 00:04:46,807
-This is like taking
candy from a baby.

54
00:04:52,074 --> 00:04:53,007
[squish]

55
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:54,907
-Huh?

56
00:04:54,941 --> 00:04:58,041
My-- my arms.

57
00:04:58,074 --> 00:05:00,374
No-- my shoulders!

58
00:05:00,407 --> 00:05:04,141
-I had completely
forgotten my own strength.

59
00:05:04,174 --> 00:05:07,441
You see, I have to keep my
powers in check at all times

60
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:10,041
to avoid causing problems
in the human world,

61
00:05:10,074 --> 00:05:12,207
because I'm too strong.

62
00:05:12,241 --> 00:05:14,841
I'll show you just how
strong I really am.

63
00:05:24,507 --> 00:05:26,841
[groan]

64
00:05:30,341 --> 00:05:31,741
-I guess it's true.

65
00:05:31,774 --> 00:05:34,941
The weaker you are, the more
you want to be part of a pack.

66
00:05:45,307 --> 00:05:49,474
I, Kurotabo, the Assassin Monk,
show no mercy to my enemies.

67
00:05:49,507 --> 00:05:52,607
Who else wishes to taste my
Dance of the Black Weapons?

68
00:05:57,074 --> 00:05:58,741
-Give up already?

69
00:05:58,774 --> 00:06:01,741
You guys don't stand a
chance against the Nura clan.

70
00:06:01,774 --> 00:06:03,907
Not in numbers, or
in sheer strength.

71
00:06:03,941 --> 00:06:05,641
Not to mention beauty.

72
00:06:05,674 --> 00:06:07,041
-Grr.

73
00:06:07,074 --> 00:06:08,841
Untangle me!

74
00:06:08,874 --> 00:06:10,041
-It's useless.

75
00:06:10,074 --> 00:06:12,241
These strings are made
out of Kejoro's obsession

76
00:06:12,274 --> 00:06:15,474
to not let go of her loved ones,
combined with a joro spider's

77
00:06:15,507 --> 00:06:17,641
relentlessly possessive nature.

78
00:06:17,674 --> 00:06:20,241
-If you're going to give
up, now is the time.

79
00:06:20,274 --> 00:06:20,974
-Not a chance.

80
00:06:21,007 --> 00:06:22,141
I'm not giving up!

81
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:24,907
The Shikoku Yokai is
destined to be victorious,

82
00:06:24,941 --> 00:06:26,874
and will rule over all Yokai.

83
00:06:26,907 --> 00:06:29,507
-Why do you want to
keep fighting so badly?

84
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:32,707
I mean, is your commander
really all that charismatic?

85
00:06:32,741 --> 00:06:33,407
-What?

86
00:06:33,441 --> 00:06:34,974
Yes, of course he is.

87
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:37,041
Lord Tamazuki's
powerful command of fear

88
00:06:37,074 --> 00:06:39,607
brings everyone to their
knees and inspires them.

89
00:06:39,641 --> 00:06:41,341
-Command of fear, huh?

90
00:06:41,374 --> 00:06:46,241
-Tamazuki is going to create
a glorious new Yokai world!

91
00:06:46,274 --> 00:06:50,141
-Well, it looks like the battle
is beginning to go against us.

92
00:06:50,174 --> 00:06:52,541
-But that doesn't
seem to bother you.

93
00:06:52,574 --> 00:06:55,574
-Because I expected
this would happen.

94
00:06:55,607 --> 00:06:56,741
-What?

95
00:06:56,774 --> 00:07:01,174
-They're all weakness,
each and every one of them.

96
00:07:01,207 --> 00:07:02,807
I never thought for
a moment that we'd

97
00:07:02,841 --> 00:07:04,641
have a chance against you.

98
00:07:10,141 --> 00:07:11,474
-Tend to my wounds later.

99
00:07:11,507 --> 00:07:12,941
-Don't be a fool.

100
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,674
You'll die.

101
00:07:14,707 --> 00:07:18,607
-We need to let Rikuo
know right away.

102
00:07:18,641 --> 00:07:23,874
-However, even a hopeless lot
can be quite useful sometimes.

103
00:07:23,907 --> 00:07:25,307
-Master Rikuo!

104
00:07:25,341 --> 00:07:27,241
-Stay back, Yuki Onna.

105
00:07:27,274 --> 00:07:28,907
-Yes, that's right.

106
00:07:28,941 --> 00:07:30,507
I'm going to use you all.

107
00:07:44,307 --> 00:07:46,307
-This-- this Yokai aura--

108
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:47,707
-It's Tamazuki.

109
00:07:47,741 --> 00:07:48,607
-Huh?

110
00:07:48,641 --> 00:07:50,541
-Tamazuki!

111
00:07:50,574 --> 00:07:51,941
-Dammit!

112
00:07:51,974 --> 00:07:52,474
-Tamazuki!

113
00:08:00,174 --> 00:08:01,241
-Lord Tamazuki?

114
00:08:01,274 --> 00:08:03,407
-Why is your leader
slaughtering everyone

115
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:04,707
in his own Night Parade?

116
00:08:15,674 --> 00:08:18,607
-That sword of his-- it's alive.

117
00:08:18,641 --> 00:08:19,174
-Master!

118
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,107
It's dangerous.

119
00:08:20,141 --> 00:08:23,474
Please, step back now.

120
00:08:23,507 --> 00:08:24,107
-Lord Tamazuki!

121
00:08:24,141 --> 00:08:25,574
They're your own people!

122
00:08:25,607 --> 00:08:29,074
Please stop!

123
00:08:29,107 --> 00:08:32,041
Weren't you going to take us
all to a brand new Yokai--

124
00:08:41,474 --> 00:08:42,941
-Lord Tamazuki--

125
00:08:47,374 --> 00:08:48,574
HARI (VOICEOVER): That's right.

126
00:08:48,607 --> 00:08:54,507
I always knew-- but I just
didn't want to admit it.

127
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:58,374
I wasn't drawn to
Tamazuki's fear.

128
00:08:58,407 --> 00:09:02,074
I was just plain
scared, so I obeyed him.

129
00:09:05,907 --> 00:09:08,607
Inugami-- what about you?

130
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:23,541
-Tamazuki!

131
00:09:23,574 --> 00:09:25,841
You call yourself a leader--

132
00:09:25,874 --> 00:09:26,874
-Kubinashi!

133
00:09:26,907 --> 00:09:28,074
-Don't, Kejoro!

134
00:09:28,107 --> 00:09:29,807
Get back!

135
00:09:29,841 --> 00:09:31,074
-Hey, let go of me!

136
00:09:31,107 --> 00:09:34,374
I won't be satisfied until
I slap his stupid face!

137
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,774
[laughter]

138
00:09:37,807 --> 00:09:38,274
-Rikuo!

139
00:09:42,574 --> 00:09:43,174
-Wait.

140
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,607
The devil's blade?

141
00:09:44,641 --> 00:09:45,374
-That's right.

142
00:09:45,407 --> 00:09:47,274
It's Tamazuki's sword.

143
00:09:47,307 --> 00:09:49,841
-The sacred sword
of Shikoku legends.

144
00:09:49,874 --> 00:09:52,574
It's said that with it, you
can destroy Yokai and conquer

145
00:09:52,607 --> 00:09:53,907
the world.

146
00:09:53,941 --> 00:09:56,374
It gains power by absorbing
the strength of every Yokai

147
00:09:56,407 --> 00:09:56,974
it kills.

148
00:09:57,007 --> 00:09:58,441
-I see.

149
00:09:58,474 --> 00:09:58,941
Hm.

150
00:10:06,374 --> 00:10:07,341
-Lord Tamazuki!

151
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:08,841
-Please, stop this!

152
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:10,807
-We beg of you!

153
00:10:10,841 --> 00:10:14,274
[shouting]

154
00:10:48,769 --> 00:10:50,703
-Come on, hurry up, everyone.

155
00:10:50,736 --> 00:10:54,003
The Yokai are waiting
for us, so let's go!

156
00:10:54,036 --> 00:10:56,969
-I don't exactly wan them to
wait, if you know what I mean.

157
00:10:57,003 --> 00:10:59,603
-I don't get why
we have to go, too.

158
00:10:59,636 --> 00:11:00,636
-Oh, man.

159
00:11:00,669 --> 00:11:02,936
I can't believe how
fast Kiyotsugu is.

160
00:11:07,203 --> 00:11:08,069
-Hold on.

161
00:11:08,103 --> 00:11:09,503
What's this hideous Yokai aura?

162
00:11:13,869 --> 00:11:16,203
-I'm getting a weird feeling.

163
00:11:16,236 --> 00:11:16,703
-Yeah.

164
00:11:16,736 --> 00:11:17,469
Me, too.

165
00:11:17,503 --> 00:11:19,436
-You two better get back.

166
00:11:19,469 --> 00:11:21,903
-Huh?

167
00:11:21,936 --> 00:11:24,336
-There you are, Yokai!

168
00:11:24,369 --> 00:11:25,336
Go!

169
00:11:25,369 --> 00:11:27,269
Tanro!

170
00:11:27,303 --> 00:11:32,103
[roar] Rokuson!

171
00:11:32,136 --> 00:11:34,536
-What's that girl doing there?

172
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:37,036
-Uh, was that a deer?

173
00:11:37,069 --> 00:11:37,736
No way.

174
00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:40,003
It couldn't be, could it?

175
00:11:40,036 --> 00:11:41,969
YURA: Bukyoku!

176
00:11:42,003 --> 00:11:42,469
Rentei!

177
00:11:45,969 --> 00:11:46,769
Stop!

178
00:11:46,803 --> 00:11:49,936
You're not going any further!

179
00:11:49,969 --> 00:11:51,403
Vanish into the abyss!

180
00:11:51,436 --> 00:11:51,903
Yura Max!

181
00:12:04,803 --> 00:12:05,203
Huh?

182
00:12:11,236 --> 00:12:12,736
-It's Yura.

183
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:14,569
And wait, is that-- a Yokai?

184
00:12:18,169 --> 00:12:19,536
-What is this guy?

185
00:12:28,036 --> 00:12:30,969
YURA (VOICEOVER): His
Yokai aura is massive,

186
00:12:31,003 --> 00:12:32,836
but I have to exterminate him.

187
00:12:32,869 --> 00:12:33,803
I must.

188
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:34,869
I can do it.

189
00:12:34,903 --> 00:12:36,769
Have faith!

190
00:12:36,803 --> 00:12:41,436
Remember, I am the heir to
the Keikain clan of Onmyoji.

191
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,003
-An Onmyoji?

192
00:12:43,036 --> 00:12:44,336
Ah, yes.

193
00:12:44,369 --> 00:12:46,603
You're a Keikain, wasn't it?

194
00:12:46,636 --> 00:12:49,436
-Your rampage ends
right here, evil Yokai!

195
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:52,836
I will not allow you to spread
distruction and hurt people.

196
00:12:52,869 --> 00:12:53,336
Yura Ma--

197
00:13:16,203 --> 00:13:17,636
[shout]

198
00:13:34,403 --> 00:13:36,536
-Heh, heh.

199
00:13:36,569 --> 00:13:38,703
-Get back, or you'll be killed.

200
00:13:38,736 --> 00:13:41,303
-It's you, the
lord of all Yokai.

201
00:13:41,336 --> 00:13:43,303
-I'll take care of this guy.

202
00:13:43,336 --> 00:13:45,569
You go and protect the humans.

203
00:13:45,603 --> 00:13:48,236
-I don't take
orders from a Yokai.

204
00:13:48,269 --> 00:13:49,069
Wait a minute.

205
00:13:49,103 --> 00:13:51,769
Did you just say protect humans?

206
00:13:51,803 --> 00:13:55,803
But you're an evil Yokai.

207
00:13:55,836 --> 00:14:00,103
-He swept in and protected Yura.

208
00:14:00,136 --> 00:14:05,336
MAN: My shameful son Tamazuki
is trying to surpass me.

209
00:14:05,369 --> 00:14:06,136
BOY: Huh?

210
00:14:06,169 --> 00:14:08,336
What do you mean by that?

211
00:14:08,369 --> 00:14:10,869
MAN: Remember the
300-year-old story

212
00:14:10,903 --> 00:14:13,769
I told you earlier,
about the huge Yokai

213
00:14:13,803 --> 00:14:15,536
army that was
annihilated by humans?

214
00:14:23,736 --> 00:14:28,803
The commander of the vanquished
army sits here before you.

215
00:14:28,836 --> 00:14:30,003
-Huh?

216
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,469
-Tamazuki is ashamed
of me because I

217
00:14:32,503 --> 00:14:35,069
was defeated by humans,
and still continue

218
00:14:35,103 --> 00:14:36,603
to lose my strength.

219
00:14:36,636 --> 00:14:39,203
That's why he's
doing all this now.

220
00:14:39,236 --> 00:14:42,303
-I obtained the devil's
blade that defeated my father

221
00:14:42,336 --> 00:14:45,836
centuries ago, and through
its ability to multiply power,

222
00:14:45,869 --> 00:14:47,469
I became strong.

223
00:14:47,503 --> 00:14:49,403
And Yokai followed me.

224
00:14:49,436 --> 00:14:51,336
This is what fear means.

225
00:14:51,369 --> 00:14:53,836
This is fear!

226
00:14:53,869 --> 00:14:57,103
I came to realize
that, and now my fear

227
00:14:57,136 --> 00:14:59,936
has finally surpassed
that of the Nura clan's

228
00:14:59,969 --> 00:15:00,769
supreme commander!

229
00:15:11,769 --> 00:15:13,269
-It's all over, Tamazuki.

230
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:29,103
-Stop!

231
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:31,403
Let me go!

232
00:15:31,436 --> 00:15:31,903
-Bastard!

233
00:15:37,969 --> 00:15:40,203
-The tables have turned now.

234
00:15:40,236 --> 00:15:42,236
-Let the girl go, Inugami.

235
00:15:42,269 --> 00:15:43,836
[laughter]

236
00:15:43,869 --> 00:15:45,503
-Humans always seem
to distract you

237
00:15:45,536 --> 00:15:48,269
right at the most
critical moments.

238
00:15:48,303 --> 00:15:50,636
It's all because of
your ridiculous ideas

239
00:15:50,669 --> 00:15:52,803
about protecting them.

240
00:15:52,836 --> 00:15:54,169
-Protect humans?

241
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:54,703
Really?

242
00:15:57,569 --> 00:15:59,836
-Humans and Yokai
can never coexist!

243
00:15:59,869 --> 00:16:01,636
Never!

244
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:04,203
-You lose!

245
00:16:04,236 --> 00:16:05,236
What's the matter?

246
00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:07,403
Make your move, if you dare!

247
00:16:07,436 --> 00:16:09,436
Now's your chance, Tamazuki!

248
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:12,636
Go on, kill him!

249
00:16:12,669 --> 00:16:16,203
-Not a very elegant way
of doing this, is it?

250
00:16:16,236 --> 00:16:17,636
INUZAMI: Do it, Tamazuki!

251
00:16:17,669 --> 00:16:18,736
Hurry!

252
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:21,603
Chop this sorry excuse
into little pieces!

253
00:16:21,636 --> 00:16:24,603
Tamazuki will open
up a whole new world

254
00:16:24,636 --> 00:16:28,936
where Yokai will be superior,
and rule over humans!

255
00:16:28,969 --> 00:16:33,069
The dawn of the
Shikoku Yokai is here!

256
00:16:33,103 --> 00:16:34,069
-No!

257
00:16:34,103 --> 00:16:36,536
RIKUO: Don't worry.

258
00:16:36,569 --> 00:16:38,803
-You shouldn't act
so brave, you know?

259
00:16:38,836 --> 00:16:41,603
-Kana, if you're
scared, close your eyes.

260
00:16:44,836 --> 00:16:49,269
If you're scared,
just close your eyes.

261
00:16:49,303 --> 00:16:51,269
[tires squealing]

262
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:53,269
[crash]

263
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:54,736
[car horn]

264
00:16:58,769 --> 00:16:59,503
BOY: It hurts!

265
00:17:07,536 --> 00:17:09,403
-I crave some fongoli.

266
00:17:09,436 --> 00:17:12,903
Yeah, that's right-- fongoli.

267
00:17:12,936 --> 00:17:15,136
-You're still alive.

268
00:17:15,169 --> 00:17:16,603
Ha ha ha!

269
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:18,036
I'll kill everyone.

270
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:20,669
Sending all of you children
to the depths of hell

271
00:17:20,703 --> 00:17:22,836
is what I enjoy doing.

272
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:23,636
-Master!

273
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:24,669
We made it in time.

274
00:17:27,903 --> 00:17:31,803
-Gagoze, a Yokai that
kills little children.

275
00:17:31,836 --> 00:17:35,203
I'm glad everyone is OK.

276
00:17:35,236 --> 00:17:36,769
-Who are you?

277
00:17:36,803 --> 00:17:38,036
Tell me.

278
00:17:38,069 --> 00:17:39,136
-Huh?

279
00:17:39,169 --> 00:17:42,036
-If you're scared,
just close your eyes.

280
00:17:44,836 --> 00:17:47,636
Taking pleasure from
killing the weak,

281
00:17:47,669 --> 00:17:50,669
harming people and
stepping on corpses.

282
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:53,636
Well, now you must answer to me.

283
00:17:53,669 --> 00:17:54,603
-You're just a kid.

284
00:17:54,636 --> 00:17:56,069
Don't get so damn cocky!

285
00:18:00,936 --> 00:18:04,403
[groan]

286
00:18:04,436 --> 00:18:06,869
-Let it be known
to every Yokai, I

287
00:18:06,903 --> 00:18:09,036
shall be the Lord
of Pandemonium.

288
00:18:09,069 --> 00:18:15,003
Follow me and be part of my
Night Parade of 100 Demons.

289
00:18:15,036 --> 00:18:15,936
-Huh?

290
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:18,303
[groan]

291
00:18:18,336 --> 00:18:19,269
KANA: That's right.

292
00:18:19,303 --> 00:18:20,703
I remember now.

293
00:18:20,736 --> 00:18:25,569
Even back then, he protected us.

294
00:18:25,603 --> 00:18:26,503
I'm OK.

295
00:18:26,536 --> 00:18:28,336
I trust you completely now.

296
00:18:28,369 --> 00:18:30,603
So I'm not scared at all.

297
00:18:30,636 --> 00:18:31,436
-Quit your nonsense!

298
00:18:34,936 --> 00:18:37,736
If you can still act that
brave after he's dead and gone,

299
00:18:37,769 --> 00:18:41,103
then I might just
consider praising you.

300
00:18:41,136 --> 00:18:42,903
I'm going to kill
him and complete

301
00:18:42,936 --> 00:18:45,069
Tamazuki's collection of fear.

302
00:18:45,103 --> 00:18:47,069
Our time has finally come!

303
00:18:47,103 --> 00:18:49,469
Now take me to the
new Yokai world!

304
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:52,336
I swear I will follow
you until the very end!

305
00:18:58,103 --> 00:19:00,303
INAZAMI (VOICEOVER): I'm
going to follow Tamazuki.

306
00:19:00,336 --> 00:19:04,736
He was the one who awakened
my sleeping powers.

307
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:10,303
And he promised me that he would
take me to a brand new world.

308
00:19:10,336 --> 00:19:13,669
I want to see that world.

309
00:19:13,703 --> 00:19:16,869
I'm very glad that I met him.

310
00:19:16,903 --> 00:19:22,369
-Inugami, there's no one in
this world more loyal than you.

311
00:19:22,403 --> 00:19:22,869
-Heh.

312
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:30,736
[coughing]

313
00:19:36,169 --> 00:19:38,236
-Tamazuki, what's the matter?

314
00:19:38,269 --> 00:19:40,403
Why are you doing this to me?

315
00:19:40,436 --> 00:19:41,869
Tamazuki?

316
00:19:41,903 --> 00:19:42,836
Why?

317
00:19:42,869 --> 00:19:43,803
Why?

318
00:19:43,836 --> 00:19:47,703
TAMAZUKI: I'm grateful to you.

319
00:19:47,736 --> 00:19:49,603
[groan]

320
00:19:49,636 --> 00:19:54,869
-With your strength, the devil's
blade will attain perfection.

321
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:58,536
You were a truly
loyal dog to me.

322
00:19:58,569 --> 00:20:02,603
However, I don't
like dirty methods.

323
00:20:02,636 --> 00:20:06,636
-But-- but I-- I
did it all for you.

324
00:20:15,869 --> 00:20:17,303
TAMAZUKI: I feel it.

325
00:20:17,336 --> 00:20:19,269
This power.

326
00:20:19,303 --> 00:20:21,936
This is fear!

327
00:20:21,969 --> 00:20:27,469
-Tamazuki, this fear you
keep harping about-- tell me,

328
00:20:27,503 --> 00:20:30,536
are we supposed to feel
it emanating from you?

329
00:20:30,569 --> 00:20:32,069
No one's going to
follow a guy who

330
00:20:32,103 --> 00:20:34,936
bears the corpses
of his comrades.

331
00:20:34,969 --> 00:20:37,636
The supreme commander of
Yokai isn't like that.

332
00:20:40,369 --> 00:20:41,703
TSURARA: He's strong.

333
00:20:41,736 --> 00:20:43,336
KEJORO: Intelligent.

334
00:20:43,369 --> 00:20:45,269
AOTABO: And you
just can't hate him.

335
00:20:45,303 --> 00:20:46,569
MAN: That's why we all--

336
00:20:46,603 --> 00:20:47,236
MAN: Follow him.

337
00:20:50,969 --> 00:20:55,203
-I took a liking to the
supreme command, Nurarihyon.

338
00:20:55,236 --> 00:20:59,669
I may be physically stronger,
but I'm no match for him.

339
00:20:59,703 --> 00:21:05,703
He is a true Yokai, and yet he
understands the human heart.

340
00:21:05,736 --> 00:21:08,036
-I get it now, Dad.

341
00:21:08,069 --> 00:21:09,569
Fear is--

342
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:11,236
-Admiration.

343
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:12,036
[laughter]

344
00:21:12,069 --> 00:21:14,069
-You and I are alike.

345
00:21:14,103 --> 00:21:16,203
At least, that's
what I believed.

346
00:21:19,269 --> 00:21:20,003
-No.

347
00:21:20,036 --> 00:21:21,603
You are nothing like him.

348
00:21:21,636 --> 00:21:23,269
-She's right.

349
00:21:23,303 --> 00:21:25,536
-It seems I was wrong.

350
00:21:25,569 --> 00:21:28,503
We are destined to
be on opposite sides,

351
00:21:28,536 --> 00:21:30,969
so let us end this
fight right now.

352
00:21:31,003 --> 00:21:34,803
And I will build my own
new world for Yokai!

353
00:21:34,836 --> 00:21:37,736
Now, awaken, devil's blade!

354
00:22:08,317 --> 00:22:13,717
[theme music]

355
00:23:38,465 --> 00:23:42,399
GIRL: The Shikoku Yokai,
Inugamigyobu Tanuki Tamazuki

356
00:23:42,432 --> 00:23:46,199
versus the Nura clan's young
heir, Master Rikuo Nura.

357
00:23:46,232 --> 00:23:48,232
Their fight finally
comes to an end.

358
00:23:48,265 --> 00:23:51,799
NARRATOR: Next time,
The Moon Is In The Sky.
