1
00:00:06,266 --> 00:00:07,766
-You're--

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,466
-Forgive me for the other day.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,933
I thought I'd come over
here to officially offer you

4
00:00:12,966 --> 00:00:15,366
my greetings.

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,100
NARRATOR: This mysterious
group of beings

6
00:00:17,133 --> 00:00:21,166
are known as the Seven Phantom
Travelers, Yokai originating

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,866
from the Shikoku region
of western Japan.

8
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,433
Normally they are not
visible to human eye,

9
00:00:26,466 --> 00:00:28,300
but it is said they
can be seen if you

10
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:31,533
peer at them through the
space between two objects.

11
00:00:31,566 --> 00:00:35,600
It is also said that
misfortune and maybe even death

12
00:00:35,633 --> 00:00:39,566
would befall any who
encounters this group of Yokai.

13
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,700
-She'll make a sufficient foe!

14
00:00:41,733 --> 00:00:45,433
NARRATOR: Inuhoo, a Yokai
that manipulates fire, and is

15
00:00:45,466 --> 00:00:48,233
the self-appointed brains of
the Seven Phantom Travelers.

16
00:00:53,533 --> 00:00:55,233
-You expect to
beat me in the sky?

17
00:00:55,266 --> 00:00:57,833
Not in a million years!

18
00:00:57,866 --> 00:01:00,400
-So are things busy
for you as usual?

19
00:01:00,433 --> 00:01:02,800
NARRATOR: Kagibari
Onna, a female Yokai

20
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:05,900
who uses her needle hair
to take men captive.

21
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:08,433
-Your hair's a complete
and total mess, you know.

22
00:01:08,466 --> 00:01:11,933
-How dare you, you
ridiculous cougar!

23
00:01:11,966 --> 00:01:16,633
Passionate Woman-Killer
Needle Hell!

24
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:18,033
-My name is--

25
00:01:18,066 --> 00:01:21,766
NARRATOR: Gangi Kozo wields
the power to control water.

26
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,500
He is formidable,
especially in the rain

27
00:01:24,533 --> 00:01:28,000
where drug is at his
power's disposable.

28
00:01:28,033 --> 00:01:32,466
Tearai-oni, he is the
strongest in all of Shikoku,

29
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,000
maybe even in all of Japan.

30
00:01:35,033 --> 00:01:38,466
He has the ability to
grow in size at will.

31
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,066
his arch-enemy is the
Nura Clan strike team

32
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,333
leader, the mighty Aotabo.

33
00:01:45,933 --> 00:01:49,533
Lord Sodemogi, as his
appearance may suggest,

34
00:01:49,566 --> 00:01:53,433
he is physically weak, but he
should not be underestimated.

35
00:01:53,466 --> 00:01:56,766
He is a fearful statue who has
the power to curse and kill

36
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,666
anyone who responds
to his calling.

37
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:02,000
-Praying to a rusty old deity
like this won't work, you know.

38
00:02:02,033 --> 00:02:04,900
You should call my name instead.

39
00:02:04,933 --> 00:02:06,400
I am Lord Sodemogi.

40
00:02:09,766 --> 00:02:12,433
Call out my name now!

41
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:16,400
NARRATOR: Yosuzume, this Yokai's
but feather's steal light, so

42
00:02:16,433 --> 00:02:18,333
that anything they
touch is plunged

43
00:02:18,366 --> 00:02:21,133
into a deep,
disorienting darkness.

44
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:24,300
She is a silent Yokai who
never speaks or even utters

45
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:25,366
the smallest sound.

46
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,333
-So here you are, master.

47
00:02:27,366 --> 00:02:29,300
I was worried about you.

48
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:32,666
I thought you came into
contact with Yosuzume.

49
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,133
-Yosuzume?

50
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:35,500
-That's right.

51
00:02:35,533 --> 00:02:37,766
I've heard that the feather
of the Yokai known as Yosuzume

52
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,466
can slip into the eye through
the tiniest of openings,

53
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,766
and create total darkness
for whoever encounters it.

54
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,566
-A girl on each arm, eh?

55
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,466
NARRATOR: Inugami, a tortured
yet lonely stray dog Yokai

56
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,033
who turns hatred and
spite into strength.

57
00:02:52,066 --> 00:02:53,533
-You creep.

58
00:02:53,566 --> 00:02:55,700
NARRATOR: Inugami's story
is the most sad and tragic

59
00:02:55,733 --> 00:02:59,233
of all the Yokai serving
Inugamigyoubu Tanuki Tamazuki.

60
00:03:03,566 --> 00:03:07,566
And finally there is
Inugamigyoubu Tanuki Tamazuki

61
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,533
who leads the Seven
Phantom Travelers.

62
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:13,200
As the son of
Inugamigyoubu Tanuki

63
00:03:13,233 --> 00:03:16,266
who has reigned over
the 88 Demons of Shikoku

64
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,133
for the last several
hundred years,

65
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,500
Tamazuki is a boy
who inherited much

66
00:03:21,533 --> 00:03:24,466
of his father's great powers.

67
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,100
Though he was originally
named Tamazusa,

68
00:03:27,133 --> 00:03:29,433
he decided to change
it to Tamazuki,

69
00:03:29,466 --> 00:03:32,500
which means to covet
the throne, thereby

70
00:03:32,533 --> 00:03:34,800
manifesting his
ambition, and setting

71
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:36,333
the stage for what was to come.

72
00:03:40,966 --> 00:03:44,866
In days of old,
people feared Yokai.

73
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,900
The one who stood at the
helm, and led the night

74
00:03:47,933 --> 00:03:50,533
parade of a hundred
demons was known

75
00:03:50,566 --> 00:03:54,733
as the Supreme
Commander of the Yokai.

76
00:03:54,766 --> 00:03:57,700
They had another name
for him, the Lord

77
00:03:57,733 --> 00:04:02,866
of Pandemonium-- Nurarihyon.

78
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,787
[theme music]

79
00:05:38,788 --> 00:05:41,288
NARRATOR: The Seven Phantom
Travelers made their way

80
00:05:41,322 --> 00:05:45,255
into eastern Japan, creeping
into the Nura Clan's territory

81
00:05:45,288 --> 00:05:48,355
and headquarters to
fulfill Tamazuki's ambition

82
00:05:48,388 --> 00:05:51,055
of conquering the entire nation.

83
00:06:03,555 --> 00:06:04,088
-Oh.

84
00:06:04,122 --> 00:06:06,188
Uh-- excuse me.

85
00:06:06,222 --> 00:06:08,455
-Hello.

86
00:06:08,488 --> 00:06:13,155
You're Rikuo Nura,
isn't that right?

87
00:06:13,188 --> 00:06:15,355
-Uh, Rikuo, do you know him?

88
00:06:15,388 --> 00:06:17,222
-No, I don't.

89
00:06:17,255 --> 00:06:18,688
-I guess I didn't need to ask.

90
00:06:21,822 --> 00:06:24,822
I could tell just
by looking at you,

91
00:06:24,855 --> 00:06:30,222
we have much in common--
young and full of potential,

92
00:06:30,255 --> 00:06:33,955
but most of all, we both
inherited the blood.

93
00:07:10,822 --> 00:07:14,755
-You're Kana Ienaga, aren't you?

94
00:07:14,788 --> 00:07:16,622
-Please, tell me.

95
00:07:16,655 --> 00:07:18,622
-What?

96
00:07:18,655 --> 00:07:19,355
-You know.

97
00:07:19,388 --> 00:07:19,955
About him.

98
00:07:22,622 --> 00:07:26,188
-Well he and I are much alike.

99
00:07:26,222 --> 00:07:29,355
You see that, don't you?

100
00:07:29,388 --> 00:07:31,388
He and I have a lot in common.

101
00:07:31,422 --> 00:07:34,322
We've both been entrusted with
the responsibility and power

102
00:07:34,355 --> 00:07:35,488
to rule over Yokai.

103
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:36,888
-You're wrong.

104
00:07:36,922 --> 00:07:38,622
He isn't anything like you are.

105
00:07:44,055 --> 00:07:45,655
NARRATOR: These
two girls continue

106
00:07:45,688 --> 00:07:49,955
to be caught in the crossfire of
the fight between the Nura Clan

107
00:07:49,988 --> 00:07:54,422
and the encroaching
88 Demons of Shikoku.

108
00:07:54,455 --> 00:07:55,255
-Perfect timing.

109
00:07:55,288 --> 00:07:57,488
Now you listen to me, Yokai.

110
00:07:57,522 --> 00:08:00,022
I don't care what you
Yokai do among yourselves.

111
00:08:00,055 --> 00:08:02,255
Go ahead and kill each
other all you want.

112
00:08:02,288 --> 00:08:04,822
It'll make my job
that much easier.

113
00:08:04,855 --> 00:08:06,955
However, I will not allow
you to harm any humans

114
00:08:06,988 --> 00:08:08,455
while you fight your little war.

115
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,955
You remember that.

116
00:08:11,988 --> 00:08:13,088
Here too.

117
00:08:13,122 --> 00:08:15,022
NARRATOR: This
girl, Yura Keikain,

118
00:08:15,055 --> 00:08:18,488
is a descendant of the
Keikain Clan of onmyoji,

119
00:08:18,522 --> 00:08:21,355
Yokai exterminators from Kyoto.

120
00:08:21,388 --> 00:08:24,855
Yura was sent to Ukiyoe Town
to hone her skills in Yokai

121
00:08:24,888 --> 00:08:27,688
extermination, so she could
fulfill her future role

122
00:08:27,722 --> 00:08:30,222
as head of the Keikain Clan.

123
00:08:30,255 --> 00:08:31,322
-Last night?

124
00:08:31,355 --> 00:08:33,055
-There's a good chance
that Yokai may still

125
00:08:33,088 --> 00:08:34,222
be lurking around here.

126
00:08:34,255 --> 00:08:36,655
So let's split up and search.

127
00:08:36,688 --> 00:08:37,288
-OK.

128
00:08:37,322 --> 00:08:39,155
Let's go that way.

129
00:08:39,188 --> 00:08:40,655
-Come with us, Kana.

130
00:08:40,688 --> 00:08:41,655
-OK.

131
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,455
-This whipping
wind is poisonous,

132
00:08:43,488 --> 00:08:47,222
and if you sustain a deep
wound, it can kill you.

133
00:08:47,255 --> 00:08:50,122
It's one of the Yokai found
in Shikoku named Muchi.

134
00:08:54,122 --> 00:08:55,555
Mr. Nura, run away!

135
00:08:59,055 --> 00:08:59,988
Hang on to this!

136
00:09:03,955 --> 00:09:04,888
Rokuzan!

137
00:09:04,922 --> 00:09:05,422
-A shikigami?

138
00:09:09,355 --> 00:09:10,355
-Good.

139
00:09:10,388 --> 00:09:12,855
I'm finally free
of my heavy burden.

140
00:09:20,988 --> 00:09:25,055
NARRATOR: Kana Ienaga, Rikuo's
closest friend since childhood.

141
00:09:25,088 --> 00:09:28,655
When the two of them were
young, Rikuo saved her life

142
00:09:28,688 --> 00:09:31,388
from a an attack
by an evil Yokai.

143
00:09:31,422 --> 00:09:34,688
For some reason, Kana has no
recollection of that event.

144
00:09:41,088 --> 00:09:42,488
-You're still alive.

145
00:09:42,522 --> 00:09:43,888
[chuckling]

146
00:09:43,922 --> 00:09:45,788
-I'll kill everyone.

147
00:09:45,822 --> 00:09:48,155
Sending all of you children
to the depths of hell

148
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:50,255
is what I enjoy doing.

149
00:09:50,288 --> 00:09:52,488
-Master, we made it in time.

150
00:09:55,488 --> 00:09:58,922
-Gagoze, a Yokai that
kills little children.

151
00:09:58,955 --> 00:10:00,888
I'm glad everyone is OK.

152
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:09,288
If you're scared, you just
need to close your eyes.

153
00:10:18,222 --> 00:10:20,822
Let it be known
to every Yokai-- I

154
00:10:20,855 --> 00:10:22,855
shall be the Lord
of Pandemonium.

155
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:26,055
Follow me, and be part of
my night parade of a hundred

156
00:10:26,088 --> 00:10:26,555
demons.

157
00:10:43,988 --> 00:10:46,455
-This feels so good.
i haven't had a chance

158
00:10:46,488 --> 00:10:49,388
to relax in a
bathtub for a while.

159
00:10:49,422 --> 00:10:51,455
-It's rough being an
onmyoji, isn't it?

160
00:10:51,488 --> 00:10:52,222
-Yeah.

161
00:10:52,255 --> 00:10:54,955
And I'm still in training.

162
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:58,255
Ienaga, why didn't you run when
that suspicious looking guy

163
00:10:58,288 --> 00:10:59,322
started talking to you?

164
00:11:01,955 --> 00:11:06,155
-Because he reminded
me of another person.

165
00:11:11,555 --> 00:11:14,955
But he turned out to
be nothing like him.

166
00:11:14,988 --> 00:11:18,422
The person I know
is really scary,

167
00:11:18,455 --> 00:11:21,888
but he makes me feel safe.

168
00:11:21,922 --> 00:11:27,355
That guy Tamazuki
is very different.

169
00:11:27,388 --> 00:11:30,355
He was really creepy.

170
00:11:30,388 --> 00:11:32,822
Just thinking about him
makes me sick to my stomach.

171
00:11:40,822 --> 00:11:42,788
I can't tell you
how awfully relieved

172
00:11:42,822 --> 00:11:44,622
I was when you
told me that you'd

173
00:11:44,655 --> 00:11:47,288
come over and spend
the night with me

174
00:11:47,322 --> 00:11:50,622
-Ienaga, this person
you keep talking of,

175
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:54,588
is he the same Yokai
who saved us that day?

176
00:11:54,622 --> 00:11:56,388
-Mhm.

177
00:11:56,422 --> 00:11:57,055
-I knew it.

178
00:11:59,988 --> 00:12:00,955
I better get out.

179
00:12:00,988 --> 00:12:02,388
I'm feeling a little dizzy.

180
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:20,704
-Supreme Commander!

181
00:12:20,737 --> 00:12:22,204
NARRATOR: This
dangerous showdown

182
00:12:22,237 --> 00:12:25,570
between the young Yokai heirs
motivates Supreme Commander

183
00:12:25,604 --> 00:12:29,537
Nurarihyon to seek out his old
rival, Inugamigyoubu Tanuki.

184
00:12:33,804 --> 00:12:35,937
-It's been 300 years.

185
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:40,037
Inugamigyoubu Tanuki,
you've changed quite a bit.

186
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:44,104
-And you also, Supreme
Commander of the Nura Clan.

187
00:12:44,137 --> 00:12:45,637
Instead of victory--

188
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:49,937
NARRATOR: 300 years ago,
the 88 Demons of Shikoku,

189
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:56,204
led by Inugamigyoubu Tanuki,
attacked a human castle.

190
00:12:56,237 --> 00:13:00,470
The humans didn't seem to stand
a chance against the Yokai army

191
00:13:00,504 --> 00:13:04,670
whose powers exceeded
all human capability.

192
00:13:04,704 --> 00:13:07,970
However, the Tanuki
Yokai were massacred

193
00:13:08,004 --> 00:13:12,004
by a single weapon used
by the humans, the legacy

194
00:13:12,037 --> 00:13:16,870
of the conqueror,
the Devil's Blade.

195
00:13:16,904 --> 00:13:22,304
But now, this sword lay
in the hands of Tamazuki.

196
00:13:22,337 --> 00:13:24,204
-Lord Tamazuki awaits us.

197
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:32,904
-What's he doing?

198
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:42,870
-The Devil's Blade is
crying out for more.

199
00:13:42,904 --> 00:13:47,970
What it wants is more blood,
more hatred to feed upon.

200
00:13:48,004 --> 00:13:49,337
NARRATOR: And now
I must tell you

201
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:53,137
more about the tortured lonely
Yokai I mentioned earlier,

202
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:58,337
a follower of Tamazuki who did
his bidding, One of the Seven

203
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:01,437
Phantom Travelers, Inugami.

204
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:04,570
His heart was marred with
intense jealousy and hatred

205
00:14:04,604 --> 00:14:05,970
for Rikuo.

206
00:14:06,004 --> 00:14:07,737
INUGAMI (VOICEOVER):
So I tried desperately

207
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:09,037
to act like one of them.

208
00:14:12,404 --> 00:14:13,504
INUGAMI: Um.

209
00:14:13,537 --> 00:14:15,037
GIRL: What's with this guy?

210
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:16,237
He's scary.

211
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,970
GIRL: Ew. what a creep.

212
00:14:18,004 --> 00:14:19,637
BOY: Man, he's annoying.

213
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,670
INUGAMI (VOICEOVER): But
they wouldn't accept me.

214
00:14:21,704 --> 00:14:24,137
I spent my entire
life being ostracized.

215
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:29,604
All because I was born
a Yokai and not a human.

216
00:14:29,637 --> 00:14:33,170
Back then I wasn't even aware of
that a world for Yokai existed.

217
00:14:33,204 --> 00:14:36,337
NARRATOR: Now, are you
all familiar with the word

218
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:38,537
"koduku"?

219
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:41,804
If you put poisonous
insects in a single dish,

220
00:14:41,837 --> 00:14:46,637
they will eat each other
until only one insect remains.

221
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:49,504
That last poisonous
insect is infused

222
00:14:49,537 --> 00:14:52,604
with the hatred and curse
of the dead insects,

223
00:14:52,637 --> 00:14:56,570
and the poison created
is known as koduku.

224
00:14:56,604 --> 00:15:01,737
The koduku poison is a perfect
analogy to the Yokai Inugami.

225
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:05,037
-And he promised me
that he would take me

226
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,737
to a brand new world.

227
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:11,204
I want to see that world.

228
00:15:11,237 --> 00:15:14,504
I'm very glad that I met him.

229
00:15:14,537 --> 00:15:20,170
-Inugami, there's no one in this
world more loyalty than you.

230
00:15:20,204 --> 00:15:24,170
[chuckling]

231
00:15:24,204 --> 00:15:26,670
[theme music]

232
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:54,437
-Rikuo Nura, you like to
stick your nose into things,

233
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:55,737
don't you?

234
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:56,304
-Yeah.

235
00:16:56,337 --> 00:16:57,804
I guess I do.

236
00:16:57,837 --> 00:17:00,404
-All to save those humans?

237
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:03,404
How noble of you.

238
00:17:03,437 --> 00:17:04,870
-What do you want?

239
00:17:04,904 --> 00:17:06,670
-But it's useless.

240
00:17:06,704 --> 00:17:08,470
Those humans are
going to become food

241
00:17:08,504 --> 00:17:11,537
for the hungry Yokai
that live in this place.

242
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:12,870
Why?

243
00:17:12,904 --> 00:17:15,504
Why is it that a weak, pathetic
and powerless little brat

244
00:17:15,537 --> 00:17:19,104
like you gets to be accepted
by both humans and Yokai alike?

245
00:17:19,137 --> 00:17:20,704
Why?

246
00:17:20,737 --> 00:17:21,770
Answer me!

247
00:17:21,804 --> 00:17:24,537
Why do you side with humans?

248
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:29,470
Humans are weak creatures
who fear and hate Yokai!

249
00:17:29,504 --> 00:17:30,870
-You're wrong.

250
00:17:30,904 --> 00:17:33,537
Not all human hate Yokai.

251
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:35,237
[chuckling]

252
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:37,604
-Well this is the
last day you'll ever

253
00:17:37,637 --> 00:17:38,970
be able to act so righteous.

254
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:48,904
Why would you do this?

255
00:17:48,937 --> 00:17:50,370
Why?

256
00:17:50,404 --> 00:17:52,537
Why do you have to put
me through all this crap?

257
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:56,937
-It's quite simple.

258
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:59,804
I want to see how
strong you are.

259
00:17:59,837 --> 00:18:01,737
-How strong?

260
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:04,637
I'm not strong at all.

261
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:09,104
TAMAZUKI: Then do
you want to die?

262
00:18:09,137 --> 00:18:10,870
-There are no
humans in this world

263
00:18:10,904 --> 00:18:13,837
who don't detest Yokai
and find us disgusting.

264
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:16,537
Humans, those damn humans.

265
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:18,037
Each and every one
of them treated

266
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:20,937
me like I was some
kind of monster!

267
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:25,070
I'm gonna kill him, and complete
Tamazuki's collection of fear.

268
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,937
Our time has finally come!

269
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:29,470
Now take me to the
new Yokai world.

270
00:18:29,504 --> 00:18:31,770
I swear I will follow
you until the very end!

271
00:18:35,437 --> 00:18:39,070
You are the only one fit to
take control of this world.

272
00:18:39,104 --> 00:18:42,870
Shall i prove it to them?

273
00:18:42,904 --> 00:18:47,037
Give me the order, and I'll
gladly bring you his head.

274
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:49,870
We must show that damn Nura
Clan the vast difference

275
00:18:49,904 --> 00:18:53,970
between Rikuo Nura
and you, Tamazuki.

276
00:18:54,004 --> 00:18:55,704
Come on, Tamazuki.

277
00:18:55,737 --> 00:18:57,870
Let me be your thing,
so I can tear him apart.

278
00:19:10,737 --> 00:19:13,637
Tamazuki, what's the matter?

279
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:15,704
Why are you doing this to me?

280
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:17,304
Tamazuki?

281
00:19:17,337 --> 00:19:18,304
Why?

282
00:19:18,337 --> 00:19:19,337
Why?

283
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:20,570
TAMAZUKI: I'm grateful to you.

284
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:27,670
With your strength, the Devil's
Blade will attain perfection.

285
00:19:30,304 --> 00:19:33,704
You were a truly
loyal dog to me.

286
00:19:33,737 --> 00:19:37,937
-But-- but I-- I
did it all for you.

287
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:50,904
-I feel it-- this power.

288
00:19:50,937 --> 00:19:53,304
This is fear!

289
00:19:53,337 --> 00:19:57,604
NARRATOR: Tamazuki, this
fear you keep harping about,

290
00:19:57,637 --> 00:19:58,837
tell me.

291
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:01,904
Are we supposed to feel
it emanating from you?

292
00:20:01,937 --> 00:20:03,837
No one's gonna follow
a guy who bears

293
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,337
the corpses of his comrades.

294
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:10,170
-That is without a doubt a
flurry of cherry blossoms.

295
00:20:10,204 --> 00:20:13,970
-Shut the hell up!

296
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,270
What?

297
00:20:15,304 --> 00:20:20,604
I just cut you down, so how
can you still be standing?

298
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:23,604
-Kyoka Suigetsu.

299
00:20:23,637 --> 00:20:26,937
TAMAZUKI (VOICEOVER): Another
one of Nurarihyon's techniques?

300
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:28,370
It doesn't matter.

301
00:20:28,404 --> 00:20:33,070
I am the one who surpassed my
father, Inugamigyoubu Tanuki!

302
00:20:39,837 --> 00:20:42,504
-It's not your father
you need to surpass.

303
00:20:42,537 --> 00:20:44,904
The only person you need to
overcome here is yourself!

304
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:54,470
[scream]

305
00:20:54,504 --> 00:20:54,970
-Tamazuki!

306
00:20:58,970 --> 00:20:59,970
-No!

307
00:21:00,004 --> 00:21:03,370
My hundred demons,
they're leaving me!

308
00:21:06,837 --> 00:21:08,804
-Tamazuki.

309
00:21:08,837 --> 00:21:11,770
-My powers are fading.

310
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:14,770
NARRATOR: During the battle,
Inugami lost his life,

311
00:21:14,804 --> 00:21:17,504
and Tamazuki's dream
of conquering all Japan

312
00:21:17,537 --> 00:21:19,304
finally came to an ignoble end.

313
00:21:35,504 --> 00:21:37,237
[barking]

314
00:21:43,137 --> 00:21:47,537
NARRATOR: Might this puppy be
the reincarnation of Inugami?

315
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:51,404
Of course, nobody can know for
certain one way or another.

316
00:21:51,437 --> 00:21:54,004
Perhaps it's just
