NARRATOR: In days of
old, people feared Yokai.

2
00:00:13,748 --> 00:00:17,948
The one who stood at the helm
and led the Night Parade of 100

3
00:00:17,982 --> 00:00:22,982
demons was known as the
Supreme Commander of the Yokai

4
00:00:23,015 --> 00:00:25,948
They had another name for him.

5
00:00:25,982 --> 00:00:28,748
The Lord of Pandemonium.

6
00:00:28,782 --> 00:00:30,582
Nurarihyon.

Nurarihyon.

10
00:02:49,009 --> 00:02:52,109
Are you familiar with
the tamazusa plant?

11
00:02:52,143 --> 00:02:54,376
-You mean the snake gourd?

12
00:02:54,409 --> 00:02:57,976
Tamazusa is what we
call a letter today.

13
00:02:58,009 --> 00:02:59,743
The shape of the
snake gourd seed

14
00:02:59,776 --> 00:03:02,709
bears a striking resemblance
to a knotted letter.

15
00:03:02,743 --> 00:03:06,109
And so, tamazusa was given as
an alternate name to that plant.

16
00:03:06,143 --> 00:03:07,109
-Wow.

17
00:03:07,143 --> 00:03:08,476
Looks like your useless
trivia knowledge

18
00:03:08,509 --> 00:03:10,243
came in handy this time.

19
00:03:10,276 --> 00:03:11,509
-Be quiet, Natto.

20
00:03:11,543 --> 00:03:14,543
-A millennium ago, the
retired Emperor Sutoku

21
00:03:14,576 --> 00:03:17,909
raised a large army to try and
unseat the reigning Emperor

22
00:03:17,943 --> 00:03:19,876
Go-Shirakawa.

23
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:24,776
His tragic defeat led to his
exile, here to Sanuki province.

24
00:03:24,809 --> 00:03:27,043
For the rest of his
life, Sutoku became

25
00:03:27,076 --> 00:03:30,076
teary-eyed when he heard the
chirping of the nightingale,

26
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:33,676
which brought back memories of
the ancient capital he left.

27
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:37,009
Legend has it, the nightingale
was so saddened by this,

28
00:03:37,043 --> 00:03:40,709
it wrapped the leaf of the
tamazusa around its beak

29
00:03:40,743 --> 00:03:44,243
in order to force
itself to be silent.

30
00:03:44,276 --> 00:03:47,543
-He knows quite a
bit of trivia, too.

31
00:03:47,576 --> 00:03:50,009
-It is because of
that legend I decided

32
00:03:50,043 --> 00:03:52,443
to name my son Tamazusa.

33
00:03:52,476 --> 00:03:55,143
I wanted him to grow
up to be understanding.

34
00:03:55,176 --> 00:03:57,209
To know right from wrong.

35
00:03:57,243 --> 00:04:00,309
But instead, my son
decided to change his name

36
00:04:00,343 --> 00:04:03,743
to Tamazuki, which means
"to covet the throne."

37
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:06,776
And now he seeks to rule
over all Yokai in the land.

-He's one of us.

50
00:05:03,609 --> 00:05:04,443
Let him come through.

51
00:05:04,476 --> 00:05:05,276
Do not attack him.

52
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:11,343
-I bring a message.

-That can wait.

You need to get treated.

00:05:13,976 --> 00:05:15,309
-Master.

56
00:05:15,343 --> 00:05:17,176
He was desperate to deliver
whenever news he has for you,

57
00:05:17,209 --> 00:05:19,109
despite his grave injuries.

58
00:05:19,143 --> 00:05:21,043
You must hear him
out, right away.

59
00:05:21,076 --> 00:05:22,009
-All right, then.

60
00:05:22,043 --> 00:05:23,709
Tell me.

61
00:05:23,743 --> 00:05:27,543
-Right before sunrise this
morning, Shikoku Yokai

62
00:05:27,576 --> 00:05:29,876
crossed Chichibo Pass
with a large army.

63
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:33,209
-The Chichibo Pass?

64
00:05:33,243 --> 00:05:35,543
-See to this Yokai's injuries!

65
00:05:35,576 --> 00:05:39,009
-Move out of the way.

66
00:05:39,043 --> 00:05:41,676
-Well, it's just as well,
because I'm itching to flight.

67
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:43,576
-The fortress at
Chichibo was supposed

68
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:45,943
to be cleared out because
of the imminent danger.

69
00:05:45,976 --> 00:05:48,176
So why would a messenger
come from there?

70
00:05:48,209 --> 00:05:51,443
-In order to relay news
until the very last moment,

71
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,609
some chose to risk
their lives and stay.

72
00:05:53,643 --> 00:05:54,876
-Just for us?

73
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:57,609
-That was a very foolish
thing for them to do.

74
00:05:57,643 --> 00:05:59,509
-I'm going to go help Kujoru.

75
00:05:59,543 --> 00:06:00,743
-I'm coming with you.

76
00:06:00,776 --> 00:06:02,876
-You know, if we'd just
been able to stop them

77
00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:06,843
at Mount Nejireme, the situation
may not have come to this.

78
00:06:06,876 --> 00:06:08,876
-Those guys knew that
the Nura clan was still

79
00:06:08,909 --> 00:06:10,609
recovering from
the internal feud

80
00:06:10,643 --> 00:06:12,143
and used it to their advantage.

81
00:06:12,176 --> 00:06:14,176
-This really pisses me off.

82
00:06:14,209 --> 00:06:16,643
-Me too.

83
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:20,176
-Shikoku was once home
to countless Yokai.

84
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:22,409
And for Tanuki
Yokai especially it

85
00:06:22,443 --> 00:06:24,976
was considered a
virtual paradise.

86
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:26,076
-Ugh.

87
00:06:26,109 --> 00:06:27,509
I wonder If I should
speak up and tell him

88
00:06:27,543 --> 00:06:29,043
that his tail is still showing.

89
00:06:29,076 --> 00:06:32,276
-There was a time when Tanuki
Yokai outnumbered humans

90
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:33,209
in your territory.

91
00:06:33,243 --> 00:06:34,109
Isn't that right?

92
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,609
-Yes, that's true.

93
00:06:35,643 --> 00:06:38,776
But 300 years ago, an
ill-omened incident

94
00:06:38,809 --> 00:06:41,376
occurred that changed
all that forever.

95
00:06:41,409 --> 00:06:42,743
-Oh.

96
00:06:42,776 --> 00:06:46,576
-We, the Tanuki Yokai,
attempted to usurp a castle

97
00:06:46,609 --> 00:06:47,343
from the humans.

98
00:06:47,376 --> 00:06:48,576
-A human castle?

99
00:06:53,676 --> 00:06:56,343
-Our foes were
mere human beings.

100
00:06:56,376 --> 00:06:59,243
In contrast, we were
a large Tanuki Yokai

101
00:06:59,276 --> 00:07:00,576
army with supernatural powers.

102
00:07:03,243 --> 00:07:05,409
For us, nothing
seemed more certain

103
00:07:05,443 --> 00:07:07,609
than a decisive victory.

104
00:07:07,643 --> 00:07:12,676
However, instead of victory,
our army of Yokai was massacred.

105
00:07:12,709 --> 00:07:14,476
-They were massacred?

106
00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:16,943
You mean every one
of them was killed?

107
00:07:16,976 --> 00:07:18,276
-That's right.

108
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:21,543
We were defeated by a single
blade wielded by the humans.

109
00:07:21,576 --> 00:07:22,409
-Hmm.

110
00:07:22,443 --> 00:07:24,176
You mean the Devil's Blade?

111
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:25,843
The legacy of the conqueror.

112
00:07:32,309 --> 00:07:34,843
-We've received word that our
reinforcements have passed

113
00:07:34,876 --> 00:07:37,643
through the entrance to
Kanto, Chichibo Pass.

114
00:07:37,676 --> 00:07:41,009
They are expected to arrive at
Ukiyoe Town before midnight.

115
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,943
-Goo.

116
00:07:42,976 --> 00:07:45,176
Is there something
else, Kagibari?

117
00:07:45,209 --> 00:07:49,676
-You haven't asked a
thing about Inugami.

118
00:07:49,709 --> 00:07:50,376
-All right.

119
00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:51,909
What is he doing now?

120
00:07:51,943 --> 00:07:54,676
-He's just sitting
there, not moving at all.

121
00:07:54,709 --> 00:07:56,743
It's as though he's
waiting for his moment

122
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:59,709
to come with every
fiber of his being.

123
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:01,009
-Huh.

124
00:08:01,043 --> 00:08:03,276
Are you scared, Kagibari?

125
00:08:03,309 --> 00:08:04,009
-No.

126
00:08:04,043 --> 00:08:05,609
Of course not.

127
00:08:05,643 --> 00:08:09,809
What's there to fear when
we have you to lead us?

128
00:08:09,843 --> 00:08:12,743
[panting]

129
00:08:21,143 --> 00:08:23,909
-So this is a
sleeper train, huh?

130
00:08:23,943 --> 00:08:27,176
I always wondered what it
was like to ride in one.

131
00:08:27,209 --> 00:08:28,543
-Huh?

132
00:08:28,576 --> 00:08:30,509
-Since it's a private room, I
thought I'd get comfortable.

133
00:08:33,109 --> 00:08:37,209
You know about
kodoku, don't you?

134
00:08:37,243 --> 00:08:37,976
-Yes.

135
00:08:38,009 --> 00:08:40,009
Of course I know about it.

136
00:08:40,043 --> 00:08:42,043
-The "ko" in the
word "kodoku" is

137
00:08:42,076 --> 00:08:46,643
there to signify the presence
of many poisonous insects mixed

138
00:08:46,676 --> 00:08:49,176
together on a single plate.

139
00:08:49,209 --> 00:08:51,276
To survive, the
poisonous insects

140
00:08:51,309 --> 00:08:54,576
kill each other off
until only one remains.

141
00:08:54,609 --> 00:08:58,076
That last insect is infused
with the hatred and curse

142
00:08:58,109 --> 00:08:59,476
of those who were killed.

143
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:03,809
And thus, the cursed creature
known as kodoku is created.

144
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:05,209
-Huh?

145
00:09:05,243 --> 00:09:06,543
Woah, jeez!

146
00:09:06,576 --> 00:09:08,843
-The Devil's Blade
your son possesses

147
00:09:08,876 --> 00:09:12,276
can strengthen itself with
the blood, flesh, and hatred

148
00:09:12,309 --> 00:09:13,943
of all of those who
are killed by it.

149
00:09:13,976 --> 00:09:15,676
Just like koduku.

150
00:09:15,709 --> 00:09:16,876
-Precisely.

151
00:09:16,909 --> 00:09:20,176
I've not seen a more
terrifying weapon.

152
00:09:20,209 --> 00:09:23,176
-The blade that massacred
the army of Tanuki Yokai

153
00:09:23,209 --> 00:09:24,609
in one swoop.

154
00:09:24,643 --> 00:09:25,409
The Devil's Blade!

155
00:09:42,843 --> 00:09:46,176
-Natto Kozo, pass me a
can of beer, will you?

156
00:09:46,209 --> 00:09:47,476
-Huh?

157
00:09:47,509 --> 00:09:48,343
-You heard me.

158
00:09:48,376 --> 00:09:49,143
Now hurry up.

159
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:56,143

00:10:28,576 --> 00:10:29,609
-Don't worry.

165
00:10:29,643 --> 00:10:31,409
I don't have a long
tongue like Inugami.

166
00:10:31,443 --> 00:10:34,709
And I won't try to
lick you like he did.

167
00:10:34,743 --> 00:10:36,776
[whimpering]

168
00:10:36,809 --> 00:10:39,743
-Don't you want to
know about that Yokai?

169
00:10:39,776 --> 00:10:41,043
-What Yokai?

170
00:10:41,076 --> 00:10:42,243
-Well, who do you think?

171
00:10:58,609 --> 00:11:02,509
KANA (VOICEOVER): He has the
same feel as that other person.

172
00:11:02,543 --> 00:11:03,609
TAMAZUKI (VOICEOVER): Hmm.

173
00:11:03,643 --> 00:11:05,909
He's trying to protect
someone like her?

174
00:11:05,943 --> 00:11:08,409
What a strange guy.

175
00:11:08,443 --> 00:11:10,309
What does he see in this human?

176
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,276
-Please tell me.

177
00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:20,409
-What?

178
00:11:20,443 --> 00:11:21,376
-You know.

179
00:11:21,409 --> 00:11:23,176
About him.

180
00:11:23,209 --> 00:11:24,076
-Hmm.

181
00:11:24,109 --> 00:11:27,809
Well, he and I are much alike.

182
00:11:27,843 --> 00:11:30,743
You see that, don't you?

183
00:11:30,776 --> 00:11:32,943
He and I have a lot in common.

184
00:11:32,976 --> 00:11:35,876
We've both been entrusted with
the responsibility and power

185
00:11:35,909 --> 00:11:36,776
to rules over Yokai.

186
00:11:36,809 --> 00:11:38,676
-You're wrong.

187
00:11:38,709 --> 00:11:40,909
He isn't anything like you are.

188
00:11:40,943 --> 00:11:41,743
-Really?

189
00:11:41,776 --> 00:11:42,576
That's interesting.

190
00:11:42,609 --> 00:11:44,043
What's different about us?

191
00:11:44,076 --> 00:11:46,043
Just what do you know about him?

192
00:11:46,076 --> 00:11:46,676
Do tell.

193
00:11:46,709 --> 00:11:49,509
I'm very curious.

194
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:51,776
Are you afraid of me?

195
00:11:51,809 --> 00:11:53,009
-No, of course not.

196
00:11:53,043 --> 00:11:54,443
Why should I be?

197
00:11:54,476 --> 00:11:55,443
-Oh?

198
00:11:55,476 --> 00:11:57,143
-I don't like you, that's all.

199
00:11:57,176 --> 00:11:58,009
-Hmm.

200
00:11:58,043 --> 00:11:59,809
-You and he are very different.

201
00:11:59,843 --> 00:12:03,943
I mean, I don't know why,
but I can say this much.

202
00:12:03,976 --> 00:12:05,876
I'm sure that inside
he's a good person.

203
00:12:05,909 --> 00:12:06,809
-Huh.

204
00:12:06,843 --> 00:12:09,576
-Oh.

205
00:12:09,609 --> 00:12:10,576
-Um.

206
00:12:10,609 --> 00:12:12,943
That's what I think.

207
00:12:12,976 --> 00:12:13,943
-If you say so.

208
00:12:17,343 --> 00:12:19,276
[gasping]

209
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:21,709
-Get the hell away from her.

210
00:12:21,743 --> 00:12:23,143
You're a Yokai, aren't you?

211
00:12:23,176 --> 00:12:24,409
-Well, well, well.

212
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:26,609
If it isn't the Onmyoji girl.

213
00:12:26,643 --> 00:12:27,609
-Ienaga.

214
00:12:27,643 --> 00:12:29,276
Are you all right?

215
00:12:29,309 --> 00:12:30,043
-Yeah.

216
00:12:30,076 --> 00:12:30,876
-Perfect timing.

217
00:12:30,909 --> 00:12:32,876
Now, you listen to me, Yokai.

218
00:12:32,909 --> 00:12:35,709
I don't care what you
Yokai do among yourselves.

219
00:12:35,743 --> 00:12:37,976
Go ahead and kill each
other all you want.

220
00:12:38,009 --> 00:12:40,209
It'll make my job
that much easier.

221
00:12:40,243 --> 00:12:42,976
However, I will not allow
you to harm any humans

222
00:12:43,009 --> 00:12:44,343
while you fight your little war.

223
00:12:44,376 --> 00:12:45,709
You remember that.

224
00:12:45,743 --> 00:12:48,443
-It's been worthwhile seeing
just what it is that the enemy

225
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,476
Commander cherishes so much.

226
00:12:50,509 --> 00:12:52,776
And quite nauseating.

227
00:12:52,809 --> 00:12:56,176
I assure you, the next time
we meet, I'll show no mercy.

228
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:58,509
[gasp]

229
00:12:58,543 --> 00:12:59,443
-Now, then.

230
00:12:59,476 --> 00:13:00,976
What was your name again?

231
00:13:01,009 --> 00:13:02,276
-Yura Keikain.

232
00:13:02,309 --> 00:13:03,309
Onmyoji.

233
00:13:03,343 --> 00:13:04,776
Remember it well.

234
00:13:04,809 --> 00:13:09,309
-Until we meet
again, Miss Keikain.

235
00:13:09,343 --> 00:13:09,809
-Oh!

236
00:13:15,676 --> 00:13:16,209
OK

237
00:13:16,243 --> 00:13:19,643
[theme music]

[background chatter]

239
00:13:39,177 --> 00:13:42,210
-I shouldn't just be lying here.

240
00:13:42,244 --> 00:13:43,277
-Did you hear?

241
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:44,077
-Yeah.

242
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:45,310
We're finally going to war.

243
00:13:45,344 --> 00:13:47,544
-But the Supreme
Commander isn't back yet.

244
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:49,477
-Can we rely on
Master Rikuo alone?

245
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,910
-Of all times for
him to be away.

246
00:13:51,944 --> 00:13:55,310
-I hear the enemy's destroyed
our fortress at Chichibo Pass.

247
00:13:55,344 --> 00:13:58,310
[shouting]

248
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:07,810
-The Shikoku Yokai could
attack us at any moment now.

249
00:14:07,844 --> 00:14:09,810
What is keeping the
Supreme Commander?

250
00:14:09,844 --> 00:14:12,310
How could he be missing
at a time like this?

251
00:14:12,344 --> 00:14:14,044
-Never during the
past few hundred years

252
00:14:14,077 --> 00:14:17,244
did I ever imagine that the Nura
clan would come under attack.

253
00:14:17,277 --> 00:14:18,577
-I'm scared.

254
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:20,077
-There's no point
in complaining.

255
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,877
In fact, I say it's time we
stand behind the third heir,

256
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,577
and take the fight to our enemy.

257
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:25,777
-Not so fast, Zen.

258
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:27,844
You're putting the
cart before the horse.

259
00:14:27,877 --> 00:14:30,744
We need to know how
Master Rikuo feels first.

260
00:14:30,777 --> 00:14:32,577
-Hmm.

261
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:33,244
-Fine.

262
00:14:33,277 --> 00:14:34,377
I agree.

263
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:36,577
Let's go ask Rikuo, I
mean, the third heir,

264
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,477
what he thinks we
should do right now.

265
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,710
-Someone!

266
00:14:40,744 --> 00:14:41,577
-You summoned?

267
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:44,077
-Where is the third heir?

268
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:46,310
-Well, I think he's--

269
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:46,977
[sigh]

270
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:48,477
-What's the matter?

271
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,777
-In the foyer.

272
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:51,077
-The foyer?

273
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:51,577

-Hey, there.

278
00:15:17,577 --> 00:15:19,044
How about it?

279
00:15:19,077 --> 00:15:20,744
Want to join me
for a little drink?

280
00:15:20,777 --> 00:15:23,577
[humming]

281
00:15:27,444 --> 00:15:28,044
-Yes.

282
00:15:28,077 --> 00:15:29,377
Thank you, Master.

283
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:30,944
-I would be honored to join you.

284
00:15:30,977 --> 00:15:32,510
-Me first, Master.

285
00:15:32,544 --> 00:15:33,977
-I don't believe it.

286
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:36,344
Is that really Rikuo?

287
00:15:36,377 --> 00:15:39,244
-Our young Master is
becoming quite the leader.

288
00:15:39,277 --> 00:15:41,177
Don't you agree, Hitotsume?

289
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:42,044
-Ha.

290
00:15:42,077 --> 00:15:43,377
He's hopeless if
he thinks he can

291
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,310
save the clan with
a bluff like that.

292
00:15:50,477 --> 00:15:52,377
-Hmm.

293
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,044
-I'm coming in, Lord Shoei.

294
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:01,177
-Did something happen?

295
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,710
The mood suddenly seems to
have changed quite a bit

296
00:16:03,744 --> 00:16:05,310
around the mansion.

297
00:16:05,344 --> 00:16:06,577
-Yes.

298
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:08,977
And it's all thanks
to Master Rikuo.

299
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,210
-Huh?

300
00:16:10,244 --> 00:16:14,944
-I'm certain now that Master
Rikuo will do something.

301
00:16:14,977 --> 00:16:15,444
-Ha.

302
00:16:29,777 --> 00:16:31,210
-The time has come.

303
00:16:31,244 --> 00:16:34,477
Our curse will
finally be broken.

304
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:37,444
[panting]

305
00:16:40,444 --> 00:16:42,410
-Inugami.

306
00:16:42,444 --> 00:16:45,244
I inherited my father's
supernatural powers

307
00:16:45,277 --> 00:16:47,110
when I was born.

308
00:16:47,144 --> 00:16:50,110
But I quickly learned that
such powers were useless,

309
00:16:50,144 --> 00:16:54,410
especially to a clan who'd lost
their edge 300 years earlier.

310
00:16:54,444 --> 00:16:57,977
There wasn't a single thing
for me to do in the clan.

311
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:03,010
Such intense eyes aren't needed
in today's Shikoku, Tamazuki.

312
00:17:03,044 --> 00:17:05,810
That was the value
placed upon me.

313
00:17:05,844 --> 00:17:09,177
I will never forgive all
of those who shunned me.

314
00:17:16,044 --> 00:17:18,944
Today I understood a little
of the jealousy that you feel.

315
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:25,977
Inugami.

316
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:29,044
I will surpass my father today.

317
00:17:29,077 --> 00:17:33,344
Crushing the Nura clan is
only just the beginning.

318
00:17:33,377 --> 00:17:36,644
[growling]

00:17:39,877 --> 00:17:40,710
-What's he doing?

-The Devil's Blade is
crying out for more.

321
00:17:51,277 --> 00:17:53,410
What it wants is more blood.

322
00:17:53,444 --> 00:17:55,477
More hatred to feed upon.

323
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:56,544
-Oh!

324
00:17:56,577 --> 00:17:59,544
-Behold, my brave
Shikoku Yokai warriors!

325
00:17:59,577 --> 00:18:02,777
Our glorious moment of
victory is now at hand!

326
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:05,044
Have no fear of the Nura clan!

327
00:18:05,077 --> 00:18:07,944
Kill to your heart's content!

328
00:18:07,977 --> 00:18:08,444
-Yeah!

329
00:18:12,377 --> 00:18:14,877
-The Shikoku Yokai
are on the move now.

330
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:17,110
-They're marching towards
the main street in Ukiyoe.

331
00:18:20,377 --> 00:18:21,810
-That's far enough.

332
00:18:21,844 --> 00:18:23,010
-Lord Hitotsume.

333
00:18:23,044 --> 00:18:25,210
-Please, wait, young Master.

334
00:18:25,244 --> 00:18:27,110
-What is the meaning
of this, Hitotsume?

335
00:18:27,144 --> 00:18:29,477
You don't intend to block
Master's way, do you?

336
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:31,510
-Please make way for
us, Lord Hitotsume.

337
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:33,610
-Yeah!

338
00:18:33,644 --> 00:18:34,610
-Be silent.

339
00:18:34,644 --> 00:18:38,877
I'm talking to Master
Rikuo right now.

340
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:39,510
-Master.

341
00:18:39,544 --> 00:18:40,844
What is all this?

342
00:18:40,877 --> 00:18:42,510
What do you think
you're doing here?

343
00:18:42,544 --> 00:18:46,077
Taking on the Shikoku Yokai
in the untimely absence

344
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:49,444
of the Supreme Commander, and
without the express consent

345
00:18:49,477 --> 00:18:51,077
of the clan's
executive committee,

346
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:54,310
is an exercise of sheer folly.

347
00:18:54,344 --> 00:18:55,610
-You're right, Hitotsume.

348
00:18:55,644 --> 00:18:56,110
-Huh?

349
00:18:56,144 --> 00:18:56,910
-So, then.

350
00:18:56,944 --> 00:18:58,444
You're in agreement with me.

351
00:18:58,477 --> 00:18:59,110
-Come on.

352
00:18:59,144 --> 00:19:00,810
Not you, too, Gyuki.

353
00:19:00,844 --> 00:19:04,077
We can't sit back and do nothing
at a critical time like this.

354
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,510
-It is because we were at
such a critical juncture

355
00:19:06,544 --> 00:19:09,477
that we must proceed
with the utmost care.

356
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:11,744
Now, if Master Rikuo
were to mobilize

357
00:19:11,777 --> 00:19:14,977
only his own Night
Parade of 100 demons--

358
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:15,810
-Huh?

359
00:19:15,844 --> 00:19:16,377
-Hey.

360
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:17,444
Wait a minute.

361
00:19:17,477 --> 00:19:19,477
-Heading out to battle
becomes an option.

362
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:21,777
We cannot stop
Master Rikuo then.

363
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:26,944
-Grr.

364
00:19:26,977 --> 00:19:27,577
Fine.

365
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:28,877
You have a point.

366
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:31,377
If the third heir takes only
those pledged to him then

367
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:34,844
he can do whatever he wants
at his own discretion.

368
00:19:34,877 --> 00:19:36,844
Of course, it remains
to be seen how

369
00:19:36,877 --> 00:19:39,877
many will actually joining him.

370
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:41,777
And even if everyone
here in the mansion

371
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:44,010
opts to go on this
foolish mission,

372
00:19:44,044 --> 00:19:46,610
the numbers will still
fall rather short.

373
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:50,244
Do you still think we have a
chance to defeat their army?

374
00:19:50,277 --> 00:19:50,810
-Huh?

375
00:19:50,844 --> 00:19:53,044
-We can't win?

376
00:19:53,077 --> 00:19:53,977
-Third heir.

377
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:57,377
I would like to
hear your answer.

378
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:59,610
Do you really think we
actually have a chance

379
00:19:59,644 --> 00:20:01,144
to win this fight?

380
00:20:01,177 --> 00:20:03,044
-The Nura clan can never lose.

381
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:04,744
-Quiet, Aotabo!

382
00:20:04,777 --> 00:20:09,544
We should never take the 88
demons of Shikoku lightly.

383
00:20:09,577 --> 00:20:12,510
And you should
know that, Aotabo.

384
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,810
[birds cawing]

385
00:20:14,844 --> 00:20:16,010
-Oh.

386
00:20:16,044 --> 00:20:18,444
-A large mass of Yokai
aura is coming towards us

387
00:20:18,477 --> 00:20:19,244
from the southeast.

388
00:20:19,277 --> 00:20:20,844
-It is?

389
00:20:20,877 --> 00:20:24,344
-There's more coming from
the northwest as well.

390
00:20:24,377 --> 00:20:26,177
Wait, from the northeast, too.

391
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:27,610
-Oh, no!

392
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:28,910
The enemy is attacking already?

393
00:20:28,944 --> 00:20:29,410
-Oh!

394
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:34,644
-It seems they made it in time.

395
00:20:34,677 --> 00:20:35,144
-Huh?

396
00:20:38,044 --> 00:20:39,077
-Master.

397
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:41,344
In response to the
circular you sent out,

398
00:20:41,377 --> 00:20:44,310
many clans have sent proxies
who have hastened to join us.

399
00:20:44,344 --> 00:20:45,177
-Thank you.

400
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:46,177
Excellent work.

401
00:20:55,344 --> 00:20:56,744
-This Yokai aura.

402
00:20:56,777 --> 00:20:58,977
The sheer quantity
is extraordinary.

403
00:20:59,010 --> 00:20:59,677
-Oh, yeah.

404
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:01,044
Now we're talking.

405
00:21:01,077 --> 00:21:02,910
-Master never
ceases to amaze me.

406
00:21:02,944 --> 00:21:05,177
-I'm in love all over again.

407
00:21:12,277 --> 00:21:13,544
-Gozumaru.

408
00:21:13,577 --> 00:21:16,177
Are we just going to sit
around here and do nothing?

409
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:17,444
-Pff.

410
00:21:17,477 --> 00:21:19,577
Weren't you listening to
what Lord Gyuki just said?

411
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:20,777
-Huh?

412
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:21,710
-Let's go.

413
00:21:21,744 --> 00:21:22,944
-Right.

414
00:21:22,977 --> 00:21:24,244
-Come on, everyone.

415
00:21:24,277 --> 00:21:25,677
Let's go!

416
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:27,577
-Yeah!

417
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:30,844
-Oh, you foolhardy sons of mine.

418
00:21:30,877 --> 00:21:34,577
I've never been more proud
to be your father than today.

419
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:35,410
[crying]

420
00:21:35,444 --> 00:21:36,644
-Cripes.

421
00:21:36,677 --> 00:21:38,510
Old men are such sentimental
softies, aren't they?

422
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:51,610
-Oh.

423
00:22:08,199 --> 00:22:11,632
[theme music]

424
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,580
-Lenaga.

425
00:23:39,614 --> 00:23:40,947
You really treasure your
hand mirror, don't you?

426
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,814
-Mirror, mirror, in my hand.

427
00:23:42,847 --> 00:23:44,814
Who is the prettiest human
or Yokai in the land?

428
00:23:44,847 --> 00:23:46,114
-You, Kana.

429
00:23:46,147 --> 00:23:46,680
-OK.

430
00:23:46,714 --> 00:23:47,747
That was weird.

431
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,814
-Next time.
