NARRATOR: In days of old,
people feared the yokai.

2
00:00:13,883 --> 00:00:17,716
The one who stood at the helm
and led the Night Parade of 100

3
00:00:17,749 --> 00:00:23,316
Demons was known as the
Supreme Commander of the Yokai.

4
00:00:23,349 --> 00:00:26,649
They had another name
for him, the Lord

5
00:00:26,683 --> 00:00:29,316
of Pandemonium-- Nurarihyon.

[yokai growling]

8
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:32,460
-Lord Tamazuki awaits us.

9
00:02:32,493 --> 00:02:34,060
-Yes, we must hurry to his side.

10
00:02:39,193 --> 00:02:40,893
RIKUO: I've drawn
Tamazuki's attention

11
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:43,160
and don't have to worry about
him targeting my friends

12
00:02:43,193 --> 00:02:44,727
or people in the town.

13
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,327
But we should still
be real careful.

14
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,693
-The yokai aura in this town
is becoming more intense.

15
00:02:49,727 --> 00:02:51,993
We mustn't let down our guard.

16
00:02:52,027 --> 00:02:52,760
-She's right.

17
00:02:52,793 --> 00:02:53,793
Those guys are ruthless.

18
00:02:53,827 --> 00:02:55,227
I wouldn't put
anything past them.

19
00:02:57,893 --> 00:02:59,527
KIYOTSUGU: Jeez,
how disappointing!

20
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,760
-Huh?

21
00:03:00,793 --> 00:03:02,693
-There are dozens and dozens
of posts on my web page

22
00:03:02,727 --> 00:03:05,193
about yokai sightings
all over this town.

23
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:07,260
Yet I still haven't
managed to see even

24
00:03:07,293 --> 00:03:09,493
a single, solitary one!

25
00:03:09,527 --> 00:03:12,527
-Well, all I can say is
you're one lucky guy.

26
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,427
We've been scared out of our
wits too many times already.

27
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,927
-Yeah, we've had
enough of yokai.

28
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,227
Right, Kana?

29
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,360
-Huh?

30
00:03:19,393 --> 00:03:21,193
KIYOTSUGU: However, I've
made a solemn promise

31
00:03:21,227 --> 00:03:24,360
to undeniably prove
the existence of yokai!

32
00:03:24,393 --> 00:03:27,827
And I won't be satisfied
until I see them with my eyes.

33
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,393
You understand, right, Shima?

34
00:03:29,427 --> 00:03:30,560
-I do!

35
00:03:30,593 --> 00:03:32,460
KIYOTSUGU: Then the
Kiyojuji Paranormal Patrol

36
00:03:32,493 --> 00:03:35,260
will have another training camp
at Nura's house this weekend.

37
00:03:35,293 --> 00:03:35,760
-Huh?

38
00:03:35,793 --> 00:03:36,793
-Uh?

39
00:03:36,827 --> 00:03:38,727
-Uh, can you give
us a break already?

40
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,493
Huh?

41
00:03:39,527 --> 00:03:40,893
[chuckles nervously]

42
00:03:40,927 --> 00:03:42,227
-I'll pass, too.

43
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,827
-Yeah, count me out.

44
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,527
[sighs]

45
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,260
-Wait, what are you saying?

46
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:50,393
The Kiyojuji Paranormal
Patrol has to stick together!

47
00:03:50,427 --> 00:03:51,527
-We'd be imposing.

48
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,127
Right, Nura?

49
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,660
-Nura, don't you
want us to come?

50
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:56,860
-Just tell him no
and be done with it.

51
00:03:56,893 --> 00:03:59,260
-You're not against
my idea, are you?

52
00:03:59,293 --> 00:04:00,593
MAKI: Let's go already.

53
00:04:00,627 --> 00:04:03,493
KIYOTSUGU: Nura!

MAMEDANUKI: You stink!

57
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,427
You smell like
fermented mapo beans!

58
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,360
NATTO KOZO: Of course!

59
00:04:19,393 --> 00:04:21,360
I'm Natto Kozo, after all!

60
00:04:21,393 --> 00:04:22,060
MAMEDANUKI: Wait!

61
00:04:22,093 --> 00:04:22,460
NATTO KOZO: Get away!

62
00:04:22,493 --> 00:04:23,560
-Wait!

63
00:04:23,593 --> 00:04:25,360
-I don't want to play
with you anymore!

64
00:04:25,393 --> 00:04:26,460
NURARIHYON: What?

65
00:04:26,493 --> 00:04:28,993
Legendary treasure, you say?

66
00:04:29,027 --> 00:04:30,360
DANUKI: Yeah.

67
00:04:30,393 --> 00:04:31,860
-Are you sure of this?

68
00:04:31,893 --> 00:04:32,993
-Positive.

69
00:04:33,027 --> 00:04:35,493
I have reason to believe
that my son Tamazuki has

70
00:04:35,527 --> 00:04:38,160
come into possession of
a legendary treasure.

71
00:04:38,193 --> 00:04:40,493
NURARIHYON: And what
is this treasure?

72
00:04:40,527 --> 00:04:43,260
-[grunts]

73
00:04:43,293 --> 00:04:46,627
-It wouldn't happen to be
the Devil's Blade, would it?

74
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,393
DANUKI: [grunts]

75
00:04:48,427 --> 00:04:50,293
-You mean, it is?

76
00:04:50,327 --> 00:04:53,093
-I'm not sure.

77
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:56,227
But I know that since
the day he got his hands

78
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:00,860
on whatever this treasure
is, Tamazuki has changed.

79
00:05:00,893 --> 00:05:02,860
He's become a
cold-blooded yokai who

80
00:05:02,893 --> 00:05:04,460
couldn't care less
about his comrades.

81
00:05:08,493 --> 00:05:12,460
-I thank you all for
gathering here tonight.

82
00:05:12,493 --> 00:05:16,193
The time has finally come
for us 88 Demons of Shikoku

83
00:05:16,227 --> 00:05:18,393
to step out of the shadows.

84
00:05:18,427 --> 00:05:24,493
Let us go forward with
this blade to lead us!

85
00:05:24,527 --> 00:05:25,660
-What is that?

86
00:05:25,693 --> 00:05:27,527
-The Legacy of the Conqueror.

87
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,860
-Indeed, it is.

88
00:05:28,893 --> 00:05:31,127
It's been known through the
ages as the Devil's Blade.

89
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,927
And now, it has found its
rightful master, Lord Tamazuki,

90
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,327
the undisputed lord of
the 88 Demons of Shikoku!

91

[yokai growling]

92
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,693
-Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup.

93
00:05:55,793 --> 00:05:57,960
-This yokai aura.

94
00:05:57,993 --> 00:05:58,960
One thing is certain.

95
00:05:58,993 --> 00:06:01,560
The Shikoku yokai are amassing.

96
00:06:01,593 --> 00:06:03,827
-Not just the Seven
Phantom Travelers.

97
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,993
Tamazuki is trying to
gather all of his followers.

98
00:06:07,027 --> 00:06:09,560
-It's obvious they
mean business.

99
00:06:09,593 --> 00:06:12,360
-We have opposition
within our clan.

100
00:06:12,393 --> 00:06:14,160
And now, from
outside, an invasion

101
00:06:14,193 --> 00:06:16,860
by the 88 Demons of Shikoku.

102
00:06:16,893 --> 00:06:21,760
This is what it must mean by
trouble at home and abroad.

103
00:06:21,793 --> 00:06:25,793
-The enemy will attempt
an all-out attack.

RIKUO (VOICEOVER):
I must stay strong.

106
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,927
I must unify the clan
while Grandpa is gone.

107
00:06:35,793 --> 00:06:36,893
I have to do it.

108
00:06:36,927 --> 00:06:38,160
I'm the grandson of Nurarihyon.

109
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:45,893
WOMAN: Shoei?

110
00:06:45,927 --> 00:06:46,393
-Hm?

111
00:06:49,293 --> 00:06:49,893
Lady Tsurara.

112
00:06:53,893 --> 00:06:56,693
To be perfectly honest,
I had no intention

113
00:06:56,727 --> 00:06:58,393
of remaining in the yokai world.

114
00:06:58,427 --> 00:06:59,693
-Hm?

115
00:06:59,727 --> 00:07:01,493
-I would have been
perfectly content

116
00:07:01,527 --> 00:07:05,927
if I had been able to blend in
with humans and live in peace.

117
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,327
But then after what
happened to my old man,

118
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:15,493
I felt my blood, my yokai
blood thirst for vengeance.

119
00:07:15,527 --> 00:07:17,793
-So that's why you came back.

120
00:07:17,827 --> 00:07:20,860
-But the Third Heir, what
the hell is he thinking?

121
00:07:20,893 --> 00:07:22,260
-Oh.

122
00:07:22,293 --> 00:07:25,693
-Not once has he encouraged me
in any way to avenge my father!

123
00:07:25,727 --> 00:07:29,427
Nor does it seem like he's
willing to do it himself!

124
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,893
I'm going crazy.

125
00:07:30,927 --> 00:07:33,827
I have to do something, or else!

126
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,127
-Shoei.

127
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,893
-Uhh.

128
00:07:38,927 --> 00:07:43,093
--[chuckles] Thanks to you, most
of the local deities have been

129
00:07:43,127 --> 00:07:44,427
crushed out of existence.

130
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:48,127
And I now have a good idea
of the Nura Clan's strength.

131
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,460
It's clear to me that
Rikuo Nura lacks the power

132
00:07:51,493 --> 00:07:54,527
to withstand the full
force of our attack.

133
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,760
INUGAMI: Tamazuki, you used
me as a foil, didn't you?

134
00:07:58,793 --> 00:08:01,660
-And you did extremely
well, Inugami.

135
00:08:01,693 --> 00:08:03,427
What you did was
necessary in order

136
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,193
to measure how strong
the Nura Clan is.

137
00:08:06,227 --> 00:08:07,560
-Yeah, well, damn it!

138
00:08:07,593 --> 00:08:10,327
I'm nowhere near
done with Rikuo Nura.

139
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,460
-There's no need
to rush, Inugami.

140
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:14,860
We'll soon begin a
full-scale attack.

Huh?

-Yuki Onna, is something wrong?

144
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:51,427
-I have this uneasy feeling.

145
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:54,127
-Yeah, so do I. I
mean, who can sleep

146
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,993
with so much bad
aura flowing around.

147
00:08:57,027 --> 00:08:58,660
It's totally unsettling.

148
00:08:58,693 --> 00:09:01,493
-Mm-hm.

149
00:09:01,527 --> 00:09:02,927
[footsteps approach]

150
00:09:05,727 --> 00:09:07,260
-So this is where
they're hiding.

151
00:09:11,693 --> 00:09:13,293
Watch me, Dad.

152
00:09:13,327 --> 00:09:15,460
They'll pay for what
they did to you.

153
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,927
MALE SPEAKER: Well
well, who dares

154
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,360
to walk straight into
the lion's den all alone?

155
00:09:36,393 --> 00:09:38,227
-This is Nura territory here.

156
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:41,027
I have no need to tell
outsiders my name!

MALE SPEAKER: [chuckles]

158
00:09:42,193 --> 00:09:44,927
You have a big mouth to
go with that big body.

159
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,027
SHOEI (VOICEOVER): Where
is that voice coming from?

160
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,660
MALE SPEAKER: In
any case, you're

161
00:09:48,693 --> 00:09:51,227
name's not important,
brat, because you're

162
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,927
going to die right now!

163
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,593
-Hah!

164
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:55,093
Ugh!

165
00:10:03,527 --> 00:10:05,893
[groans]

166
00:10:12,127 --> 00:10:14,627
-You fiddle with
your bonsai all day.

167
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:19,193
Must be pretty easy being
a yokai these days, hm?

168
00:10:19,227 --> 00:10:20,427
I mean look at yourself.

169
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,860
You act like an old human.

170
00:10:21,893 --> 00:10:24,093
-An old human, eh?

171
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:27,860
That's not bad at all.

172
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:32,727
Shoei, do you know why I
chose to join the Nura Clan?

173
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:37,493
I took a liking to the
Supreme Commander Nurarihyon.

174
00:10:37,527 --> 00:10:42,160
I may be physically stronger,
but I'm no match for him.

175
00:10:42,193 --> 00:10:44,293
He is a true yokai.

176
00:10:44,327 --> 00:10:48,293
And yet he understands
the human heart.

177
00:10:48,327 --> 00:10:49,493
-Huh?

178
00:10:49,527 --> 00:10:51,427
What is that supposed to mean?

179
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,260
-Huh?

180
00:10:52,293 --> 00:10:54,060
You will understand some day.

181
00:10:54,093 --> 00:10:56,760
When that time comes,
make your own choice

182
00:10:56,793 --> 00:10:58,493
and follow that path.

183
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,160
-Damn it.

184
00:11:03,193 --> 00:11:06,460
I failed you, Dad.

185
00:11:06,493 --> 00:11:07,560
-What?

186
00:11:07,593 --> 00:11:08,627
You're not dead yet?

187
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:11,493
You're a real stubborn
one, aren't you?

188
00:11:11,527 --> 00:11:12,960
-Aagh!

189
00:11:12,993 --> 00:11:15,893
-I'll put you out of
your misery right now!

190
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,260
Ahh, arrgh!

191
00:11:25,693 --> 00:11:28,327
What the-- I'll break you again!

192
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,427
-This is Nura Clan territory!

193
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,093
We will not let
you do as you like!

194
00:11:32,127 --> 00:11:33,460
-Come back!

195
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:34,860
Ugh!

196
00:11:34,893 --> 00:11:35,793
[grunts]

197
00:11:38,627 --> 00:11:40,127
-Let them go, Tearai Oni.

198
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,027
-Lord Tamazuki.

199
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,093
[grunts]

200
00:11:46,993 --> 00:11:49,727
-We'll settle all of this
during our final battle.

201
00:12:02,328 --> 00:12:04,922
-[panting]

202
00:12:04,922 --> 00:12:06,922
Where's Shoei?

203
00:12:06,955 --> 00:12:09,755
-Master!

204
00:12:09,789 --> 00:12:12,355
-How is he?

205
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:13,655
What happened?

206
00:12:13,689 --> 00:12:16,722
-He marched right into the
hideout of the Shikoku yokai.

207
00:12:16,755 --> 00:12:18,155
-[gasps]

208
00:12:18,189 --> 00:12:19,689
-All alone.

209
00:12:19,722 --> 00:12:20,589
-[sighs]

210
00:12:25,922 --> 00:12:29,089
It's all my fault.

211
00:12:29,122 --> 00:12:32,755
I'm to blame because I'm
so weak and ineffective.

212
00:12:32,789 --> 00:12:34,055
MALE SPEAKER: Shut the hell up!

213
00:12:34,089 --> 00:12:34,989
-Huh?

214
00:12:35,022 --> 00:12:36,455
-If Shoei could
speak now, that's

215
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:38,155
exactly what he'd say to you.

216
00:12:38,189 --> 00:12:40,289
Do you really think he'd
blame others for something

217
00:12:40,322 --> 00:12:42,122
he brought upon himself?

218
00:12:42,155 --> 00:12:45,155
What happens in a family
is settled by the family.

219
00:12:45,189 --> 00:12:46,255
So he took action.

220
00:12:46,289 --> 00:12:47,455
That's all.

221
00:12:47,489 --> 00:12:49,455
-Then what am I supposed to do?

222
00:12:49,489 --> 00:12:52,989
Hihi was a sworn brother who
pledged his loyalty to Grandpa.

223
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,722
Isn't he family?

224
00:12:54,755 --> 00:12:57,455
And that also makes his son,
Shoei, a part of my family,

225
00:12:57,489 --> 00:12:58,622
too.

226
00:12:58,655 --> 00:13:01,089
And yet, I didn't--

227
00:13:01,122 --> 00:13:03,422
-If you feel that way,
then stand up and fight!

228
00:13:03,455 --> 00:13:04,822
-Uh!

229
00:13:04,855 --> 00:13:08,355
-With your own Night
Parade of 100 Demons.

230
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:11,522
-All of us swore our loyalty to
the Supreme Commander as well

231
00:13:11,555 --> 00:13:14,022
as your father, the
previous leader.

232
00:13:14,055 --> 00:13:18,622
Thus, being their kin, that
loyalty includes you as well.

233
00:13:18,655 --> 00:13:21,255
-As it stands now, we
all extend our loyalty

234
00:13:21,289 --> 00:13:23,922
to you because of the
Supreme Commander.

235
00:13:23,955 --> 00:13:25,189
-He is correct.

236
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:27,089
We all stand with you as equals.

237
00:13:27,122 --> 00:13:29,255
But understand, it is
the Supreme Commander

238
00:13:29,289 --> 00:13:31,589
who is the true
focus of our loyalty.

239
00:13:31,622 --> 00:13:35,089
We are not your Night
Parade of 100 Demons.

240
00:13:35,122 --> 00:13:39,589
-You're saying I should form my
own Night Parade of 100 Demons?

241
00:13:39,622 --> 00:13:40,622
-Exactly!

242
00:13:40,655 --> 00:13:42,189
You should exchange
cups of loyalty

243
00:13:42,222 --> 00:13:45,489
with everyone, just as I
did, but not as equals--

244
00:13:45,522 --> 00:13:48,655
as a 7:3 pledge between
master and servant.

245
00:13:48,689 --> 00:13:50,089
-Master and servant?

246
00:13:50,122 --> 00:13:54,722
DARUMA: Yes, lead
your own Night Parade.

247
00:13:54,755 --> 00:13:58,289
-But the big problem with that
is that my yokai powers only

248
00:13:58,322 --> 00:14:00,722
awaken during the night.

249
00:14:00,755 --> 00:14:04,389
I can't believe anyone would
follow someone like me.

250
00:14:04,422 --> 00:14:05,655
-Then you're a fool!

251
00:14:09,155 --> 00:14:10,689
-What is your problem?

252
00:14:10,722 --> 00:14:14,455
-Why don't you quit whining
and stand up for yourself?

253
00:14:14,489 --> 00:14:16,122
-I know that.

254
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:18,222
I don't want to
stay weak forever.

255
00:14:18,255 --> 00:14:20,422
I want to do something.

256
00:14:20,455 --> 00:14:21,722
-Uh!

257
00:14:21,755 --> 00:14:25,622
I like the look in
your eyes, Rikuo.

258
00:14:25,655 --> 00:14:28,889
Day or night, you
are who you are.

259
00:14:28,922 --> 00:14:29,922
-Huh?

260
00:14:29,955 --> 00:14:31,022
ZEN: The time of day
will have nothing

261
00:14:31,055 --> 00:14:33,189
to do with your Night
Parade of 100 Demons.

262
00:14:33,222 --> 00:14:36,622
It's you that will draw
everyone to your side--

263
00:14:36,655 --> 00:14:38,022
the exact same way I did.

264
00:14:44,255 --> 00:14:44,722
-Uh?

265
00:14:47,655 --> 00:14:48,955
Rikuo?

266
00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:52,955
What are you doing up
and around at this hour?

267
00:14:52,989 --> 00:14:53,555
-It's nothing.

268
00:14:55,955 --> 00:14:56,422
-Hm.

269
00:15:13,222 --> 00:15:14,122
-Wait!

270
00:15:14,155 --> 00:15:15,489
Uhh, Grandpa, wait!

271
00:15:15,522 --> 00:15:17,289
I want to come with you!

272
00:15:17,322 --> 00:15:20,389
-You are still too
young to join, Rikuo.

273
00:15:20,422 --> 00:15:22,289
-But why?

274
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:24,889
-Because we, yokai,
use ghostly jutsu

275
00:15:24,922 --> 00:15:26,955
as we dance through the skies.

276
00:15:26,989 --> 00:15:28,989
We appear and disappear at will.

277
00:15:29,022 --> 00:15:31,655
We are masters of
fighting and can easily

278
00:15:31,689 --> 00:15:34,822
change our forms and appearance,
all beyond the imagination

279
00:15:34,855 --> 00:15:36,655
of the humans.

280
00:15:36,689 --> 00:15:41,055
You are still far too young
to comprehend such things.

281
00:15:41,089 --> 00:15:44,755
-But I'm the grandson
of the great Nurarihyon.

282
00:15:44,789 --> 00:15:47,089
NURARIHYON: Being the
grandson of Nurarihyon

283
00:15:47,122 --> 00:15:49,889
does not decide who and
what you will become.

284
00:15:49,922 --> 00:15:54,322
That is for you
to choose, Rikuo.

285
00:15:54,355 --> 00:15:55,655
-Grandpa was right.

286
00:15:55,689 --> 00:15:59,255
I'm not doing this because
I'm Nurarihyon's grandson.

287
00:15:59,289 --> 00:16:03,122
It's because I don't want to
see anybody get hurt anymore.

288
00:16:03,155 --> 00:16:03,889
That's my wish!

289
00:16:10,755 --> 00:16:11,989
-Master.

290
00:16:12,022 --> 00:16:14,989
-Huh?

291
00:16:15,022 --> 00:16:16,355
I, uh--

292
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:17,422
-Don't worry.

293
00:16:17,455 --> 00:16:19,722
Lord Zen told us everything.

294
00:16:19,755 --> 00:16:22,622
-I've been waiting for
this day to come, Master.

295
00:16:22,655 --> 00:16:24,422
-Me, too, Master.

296
00:16:24,455 --> 00:16:27,122
-Nothing would make
us happier, Master.

297
00:16:27,155 --> 00:16:27,622
-Hm.

298
00:16:46,955 --> 00:16:49,555
-Whether you are
human or yokai, we

299
00:16:49,589 --> 00:16:52,122
accept you as our lord
and master, and pledge

300
00:16:52,155 --> 00:16:54,589
to follow you for the
rest of our lives.

301
00:16:54,622 --> 00:16:55,155
-Yeah.

302
00:16:55,189 --> 00:16:56,222
-That's right.

303
00:16:56,255 --> 00:16:57,322
-Yes.

304
00:16:57,355 --> 00:16:59,189
-Please try to always
be true to yourself

305
00:16:59,222 --> 00:17:01,822
and to always follow your
heart on whatever path

306
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:03,255
you decide to walk.

307
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:05,755
KUROTABO: And if you
encounter danger on that road,

308
00:17:05,789 --> 00:17:08,089
we shall all be there
to clear the way.

309
00:17:08,122 --> 00:17:08,922
-Thank you all.

310
00:17:29,322 --> 00:17:29,789
-Huh?

311
00:17:29,822 --> 00:17:30,289
Ahh.

312
00:17:34,789 --> 00:17:35,255
Huh?

313
00:17:40,722 --> 00:17:42,155
Hah.

314
00:17:42,189 --> 00:17:42,655
Oh.

315
00:17:45,489 --> 00:17:47,189
-I'm counting on you, Yuki Onna.

316
00:17:52,589 --> 00:17:53,589
-What's wrong?

317
00:17:53,622 --> 00:17:54,555
-Huh?

318
00:17:54,589 --> 00:17:56,055
Oh, it's nothing.

319
00:18:04,055 --> 00:18:05,022
-Mm, mm.

320
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:36,422
-Humph.

321
00:18:36,455 --> 00:18:38,789
So you're leading your
own Night Parade, huh?

322
00:18:38,822 --> 00:18:39,722
-Mm-hm.

323
00:18:39,755 --> 00:18:41,855
No more hesitation.

324
00:18:41,889 --> 00:18:45,055
RIKUO YOKAI: I wonder what
you, a mere human, can do?

325
00:18:45,089 --> 00:18:46,889
-Good question.

326
00:18:46,922 --> 00:18:50,555
It's really hard
to become like you.

327
00:18:50,589 --> 00:18:55,155
You're really strong
and fearsome and scary.

328
00:18:55,189 --> 00:19:00,889
But I have no intention of
letting you have all of me.

329
00:19:00,922 --> 00:19:04,422
I want to protect
humans and yokai.

330
00:19:04,455 --> 00:19:06,089
And I can't let
you take over that.

331
00:19:09,055 --> 00:19:09,522
-Hm.

332
00:19:14,422 --> 00:19:15,489
All right.

333
00:19:15,522 --> 00:19:17,855
Then I'll let you take
care of the humans.

334
00:19:17,889 --> 00:19:21,622
You can leave the yokai to me.

335
00:19:21,655 --> 00:19:26,755
-Some day, I'd like to see the
world from up on that branch

336
00:19:26,789 --> 00:19:28,922
that you always sit on.

337
00:19:28,955 --> 00:19:32,222
-It's way too soon
for a kid like you.

338
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:34,355
-Hey, I'm not a kid anymore.

339
00:19:34,389 --> 00:19:36,522
RIKUO YOKAI: I called you
a kid because you are one.

340
00:19:42,522 --> 00:19:43,989
[thuds]

341
00:19:44,022 --> 00:19:45,489
Uh?

342
00:19:45,522 --> 00:19:49,422
-[grunts]

343
00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:50,122
-Wait!

344
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:50,789
Shoei!

345
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:51,622
What are you doing?

346
00:19:51,655 --> 00:19:53,189
You shouldn't be moving around!

347
00:19:53,222 --> 00:19:55,522
-Be quiet, you soft weakling.

348
00:19:55,555 --> 00:19:58,589
[groans]

349
00:19:58,622 --> 00:19:59,622
-Shoei, please!

350
00:19:59,655 --> 00:20:01,289
-No, I have to go back there!

351
00:20:01,322 --> 00:20:02,589
-[gasps]

352
00:20:07,389 --> 00:20:10,289
If you're planning to raid
the Shikoku yokai again,

353
00:20:10,322 --> 00:20:12,122
I'm coming with you.

354
00:20:12,155 --> 00:20:12,622
-Huh?

355
00:20:17,489 --> 00:20:20,855
-What is impossible for
one can be done together

356
00:20:20,889 --> 00:20:23,755
with the Night
Parade of 100 Demons.

357
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:24,255
I promise.

358
00:20:27,222 --> 00:20:28,722
RIKUO YOKAI: There's
nothing to fear.

359
00:20:28,755 --> 00:20:31,989
Our enemy is just a
bunch of demon tanuki.

360
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,822
Don't even plan on dying.

361
00:20:33,855 --> 00:20:36,389
They're not worth it.

362
00:20:36,422 --> 00:20:39,989
After all, you
belong to our family.

363
00:20:40,022 --> 00:20:41,722
-Huh?

364
00:20:41,755 --> 00:20:42,789
-That's right.

365
00:20:42,822 --> 00:20:44,089
You're our family.

366
00:20:47,989 --> 00:20:51,722
-Avenge your old man and take
the hide of his murderer.

367
00:20:51,755 --> 00:20:53,689
Don't worry, we have
your back covered.

368
00:20:53,722 --> 00:20:56,022
-[gasps]

369
00:20:56,055 --> 00:20:57,922
-Master!

370
00:20:57,955 --> 00:21:00,889
-Master, what happened?

371
00:21:00,922 --> 00:21:02,022
-Hm.

372
00:21:02,055 --> 00:21:03,955
All right, this is the
beginning of our Night

373
00:21:03,989 --> 00:21:05,789
Parade of 100 Demons.

374
00:21:05,822 --> 00:21:06,755
All of us, together.

375
00:21:19,255 --> 00:21:21,155
-It's a beginning.

376
00:21:21,189 --> 00:21:24,889
But I'm afraid it's still
a very small Night Parade.

377
00:21:24,922 --> 00:21:27,889
-It will become a
formidable power in time.

378
00:21:27,922 --> 00:21:30,655
-Now, go get them, Rikuo.

379
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:34,189
SHOEI (VOICEOVER): Dad,
I've finally chosen the path

380
00:21:34,222 --> 00:21:35,289
that I wish to follow.

381
00:21:42,489 --> 00:21:49,755
-Look, Inugami, it's the
dawn of the Shikoku era.

382
00:21:49,789 --> 00:21:52,722
-This time I swear, I'll
bite his ugly head off

383
00:21:52,755 --> 00:21:54,822
and prove we're superior.

384
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:57,889
-Now, the great war
of the yokai begins.

385
00:22:10,744 --> 00:22:14,744
[music playing]

386
00:23:38,302 --> 00:23:39,469
MAKI: What?

387
00:23:39,502 --> 00:23:41,869
You're a soccer representative
for Japan, Shima?

388
00:23:41,902 --> 00:23:43,302
SHIMA: Yup, the under-14 group.

389
00:23:43,336 --> 00:23:45,536
MAKI: Then what are you
doing looking for yokai?

390
00:23:45,569 --> 00:23:46,669
SHIMA: What do you mean?

391
00:23:46,702 --> 00:23:48,502
RIKUO YOKAI: You should
be focusing on soccer.

392
00:23:48,536 --> 00:23:52,236
RIKUO YOKAI (VOICEOVER): Next
time, "Towards the Sunrise."
