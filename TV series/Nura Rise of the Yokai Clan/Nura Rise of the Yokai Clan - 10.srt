NARRATOR: In days of
old, people feared Yokai.

00:00:13,466 --> 00:00:16,466
The one who stood at the helm
and led the Night Parade of 100

3
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:23,300
Demons was known as the
supreme commander of the Yokai.

4
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:28,533
They had another name for
him-- the Lord of Pandemonium,

5
00:00:28,566 --> 00:00:31,266
Nurarihyon.

00:02:08,285 --> 00:02:09,051
Ah.

8
00:02:09,085 --> 00:02:11,285
What are you up to, master?

9
00:02:11,318 --> 00:02:13,151
-Yuki Onna.

10
00:02:13,185 --> 00:02:14,885
I was looking at the moon.

11
00:02:14,918 --> 00:02:16,951
Isn't it pretty?

12
00:02:16,985 --> 00:02:18,985
-Yes, it is.

13
00:02:19,018 --> 00:02:22,651
-You know, I wish every day was
quiet and peaceful like this.

14
00:02:22,685 --> 00:02:24,851
-It's the perfect night
to go scare people!

15
00:02:24,885 --> 00:02:31,551
-Uh, well-- yeah, it is.

16
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:34,751
NARRATOR: Rikuo has demonstrated
his strong resolve and kindness

17
00:02:34,785 --> 00:02:37,785
by forgiving Yuki's treason.

18
00:02:37,818 --> 00:02:42,318
However, unbeknownst
to Rikuo, ominous winds

19
00:02:42,351 --> 00:02:46,085
were already beginning to sir
and blow in from the west.

GIRL: Eating The Fruit From
Beyond The Evil Mirror.

00:03:02,651 --> 00:03:03,585

MALE VOICE: Kana.

24
00:03:06,051 --> 00:03:08,451
Kana.

25
00:03:08,485 --> 00:03:10,951
Let's play again sometime.

26
00:03:19,151 --> 00:03:21,285
-I had that terrible
dream again.

27
00:03:21,318 --> 00:03:26,551
The same dream I've been having
since I was six years old.

28
00:03:26,585 --> 00:03:30,785
It's my birthday, and I had
to wake up feeling like this.

29
00:03:37,351 --> 00:03:38,285
Huh?

30
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:40,685
KANA (VOICEOVER): I'm so sleepy.

31
00:03:40,718 --> 00:03:45,751
I didn't sleep well because
of that creepy dream.

MALE VOICE: Kana.

33
00:03:47,851 --> 00:03:50,518
You're still six years old.

34
00:03:50,551 --> 00:03:54,318
When you're older,
let's play again.

35
00:03:54,351 --> 00:04:00,918
I promise, I'll come
and get you on your--

36
00:04:00,951 --> 00:04:02,118
KANA (VOICEOVER): Promise?

37
00:04:02,151 --> 00:04:03,518
What promise?

38
00:04:03,551 --> 00:04:04,285
I can't remember.

39
00:04:07,985 --> 00:04:08,885
[whistle]

40
00:04:08,918 --> 00:04:10,151
-Nice, Shima!

41
00:04:10,185 --> 00:04:13,785
-Way to go, Japan's under
14 soccer representative.

42
00:04:13,818 --> 00:04:14,285
-Go!

43
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:15,318
Go!

44
00:04:15,351 --> 00:04:16,385
-Thanks a lot for
helping out, Aotabo.

45
00:04:16,418 --> 00:04:17,818
I mean, Kurata.

46
00:04:17,851 --> 00:04:18,685
-No problem.

47
00:04:18,718 --> 00:04:19,651
This is nothing.

48
00:04:19,685 --> 00:04:20,518
-Hooray!

49
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:21,851
Hooray!

50
00:04:21,885 --> 00:04:23,451
Faster!

51
00:04:23,485 --> 00:04:25,785
-You can stop that now, Tsurara.

52
00:04:25,818 --> 00:04:27,318
-You've got it wrong.

53
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:28,451
One more time.

54
00:04:28,485 --> 00:04:29,618
Don't be embarrassed.

55
00:04:29,651 --> 00:04:32,751
The uho stuff will help
protect you from Yokai.

56
00:04:32,785 --> 00:04:35,651
This one's designed for
beginnings like yourself.

57
00:04:35,685 --> 00:04:37,718
-Why on earth do we have to--

58
00:04:37,751 --> 00:04:40,585
-Learn how to do something
as weird as this?

59
00:04:40,618 --> 00:04:42,285
-It's for your own good.

60
00:04:42,318 --> 00:04:44,751
Do you wanna be assaulted
in the nude again?

61
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:47,385
[groaning]

62
00:04:47,418 --> 00:04:49,218
KANA (VOICEOVER): What was it?

63
00:04:49,251 --> 00:04:49,951
The promise.

64
00:04:52,951 --> 00:04:53,751
-Come on.

65
00:04:53,785 --> 00:04:55,285
You should learn it too, Ienaga.

66
00:04:55,318 --> 00:04:55,818
-Huh?

67
00:04:55,851 --> 00:04:56,785
Wait.

68
00:04:56,818 --> 00:04:58,451
-In fact, you're
the one who needs

69
00:04:58,485 --> 00:05:00,618
to learn it more than
anyone else here.

70
00:05:00,651 --> 00:05:02,485
'Cause you always
seem to encounter

71
00:05:02,518 --> 00:05:04,085
Yokai wherever you go.

72
00:05:04,118 --> 00:05:07,251
Now, copy me.

73
00:05:07,285 --> 00:05:08,985
MAN: I see you're
all working hard!

74
00:05:12,285 --> 00:05:14,585
-That's not ninpo.

75
00:05:14,618 --> 00:05:18,118
-Practicing Onmyoji's self
defense jutsu under blue skies,

76
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:21,618
oh, the magnificent sight of
energetic youth in action!

77
00:05:21,651 --> 00:05:22,785
All right!

78
00:05:22,818 --> 00:05:25,251
I've got new Yokai
encounter stories to share.

79
00:05:25,285 --> 00:05:26,285
GIRLS: Oh, boy.

80
00:05:26,318 --> 00:05:29,351
-But before all that--

81
00:05:29,385 --> 00:05:30,785
-What is it?

82
00:05:30,818 --> 00:05:34,485
-Ienaga, today is the happy day
you were born into this world.

83
00:05:34,518 --> 00:05:37,085
Happy birthday.

84
00:05:37,118 --> 00:05:38,318
-Wow, it's your birthday?

85
00:05:38,351 --> 00:05:40,151
-Oh, happy birthday.

86
00:05:40,185 --> 00:05:41,518
-But you didn't have to.

87
00:05:41,551 --> 00:05:44,051
-Come on, Ienaga,
no need to feel shy.

88
00:05:44,085 --> 00:05:45,218
You're part of this group.

89
00:05:45,251 --> 00:05:46,851
I want you to accept it.

90
00:05:46,885 --> 00:05:49,051
-Well then, thank you.

91
00:05:49,085 --> 00:05:50,018
-Well, open it.

92
00:05:50,051 --> 00:05:52,318
I wanna see what you got.

93
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:53,518
-Wow, that box.

94
00:05:53,551 --> 00:05:54,985
It's a fancy brand!

95
00:05:58,751 --> 00:06:01,118
-Uh-- is that a voodoo doll?

96
00:06:01,151 --> 00:06:03,251
-What is this thing?

97
00:06:03,285 --> 00:06:06,251
-It's a little doll
of you in Yokai form!

98
00:06:06,285 --> 00:06:07,085
What do you think?

99
00:06:07,118 --> 00:06:09,318
It is amazingly cute, isn't it?

100
00:06:09,351 --> 00:06:09,885
-Yuck!

101
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:10,951
Who'd want that?

102
00:06:10,985 --> 00:06:12,085
-What?

103
00:06:12,118 --> 00:06:13,818
But I had this doll made
by a famous designer.

104
00:06:13,851 --> 00:06:15,718
-What a big waste
of their talent.

105
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:17,818
-Thank you for the
gift, Kyotsugu.

106
00:06:17,851 --> 00:06:19,818
Excuse me, I have to go now.

107
00:06:19,851 --> 00:06:20,985
-Huh?

108
00:06:21,018 --> 00:06:23,051
Aren't you going to stay
for our Yokai discussion?

109
00:06:23,085 --> 00:06:25,851
-I'm sorry I'm
really sleepy today.

110
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:26,651
-There.

111
00:06:26,685 --> 00:06:28,451
I'm all done.

112
00:06:28,485 --> 00:06:30,685
I just have to return
these to the classroom.

113
00:06:30,718 --> 00:06:32,318
You guys can go on ahead.

114
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:33,451
-But master--

115
00:06:33,485 --> 00:06:35,451
-You're in charge of
making dinner, right?

116
00:06:35,485 --> 00:06:36,651
Head on back to the house.

117
00:06:36,685 --> 00:06:38,651
You don't have to
worry about me.

118
00:06:38,685 --> 00:06:39,585
-Yeah.

119
00:06:39,618 --> 00:06:40,585
Just leave it to me.

120
00:06:40,618 --> 00:06:42,051
I'll take care of the master.

121
00:06:42,085 --> 00:06:43,151
-Kay.

122
00:06:43,185 --> 00:06:45,651
Well, I guess I'll be
going on home, then.

123
00:06:45,685 --> 00:06:47,685
Just don't stay
out too late, OK?

124
00:06:47,718 --> 00:06:48,318
-Don't worry.

125
00:06:48,351 --> 00:06:48,985
I won't.

126
00:06:49,018 --> 00:06:50,851
-Please hurry home!

127
00:06:50,885 --> 00:06:51,351
All right?

128
00:06:56,651 --> 00:06:58,385
KANA: It's sweet how
he brought me a gift,

129
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,585
but this is kind of-- well--

KIYOTSUGU (VOICEOVER):
Happy birthday!

MALE VOICE: On your
birthday, I'll come for you.

132
00:07:09,718 --> 00:07:11,151
-I'd better hurry home.

133
00:07:14,151 --> 00:07:16,951
-Have any of you heard the
story of the purple mirror?

134
00:07:16,985 --> 00:07:17,518
-Uh-uh.

135
00:07:17,551 --> 00:07:18,751
What is it about?

136
00:07:18,785 --> 00:07:22,185
-It's about the
Yokai Ungaikyo, also

137
00:07:22,218 --> 00:07:26,618
known as the purple mirror, the
mirror that reveals all demons.

138
00:07:26,651 --> 00:07:28,751
It it said that if you
look into this mirror,

139
00:07:28,785 --> 00:07:30,851
you will be killed on
your 13th birthday.

140
00:07:34,618 --> 00:07:35,985
KANA (VOICEOVER):
I don't remember

141
00:07:36,018 --> 00:07:39,951
the station being this far away.

142
00:07:39,985 --> 00:07:41,751
GIRL: Killed?

143
00:07:41,785 --> 00:07:43,851
Why on the 13th birthday?

144
00:07:43,885 --> 00:07:46,785
-In the Yokai world,
you're considered an adult

145
00:07:46,818 --> 00:07:48,751
as soon as you
turn 13 years old.

146
00:07:48,785 --> 00:07:49,551
-Oh.

147
00:07:49,585 --> 00:07:51,385
That makes sense.

148
00:07:51,418 --> 00:07:53,718
-So once you become an
adult, it kills you?

149
00:07:53,751 --> 00:07:54,918
-Yes.

150
00:07:54,951 --> 00:07:56,951
Like eating a piece
of ripe fruit.

151
00:07:56,985 --> 00:07:59,118
-Yeah, well we're not fruit, OK?

152
00:07:59,151 --> 00:08:02,051
-Sorry I'm late.

153
00:08:02,085 --> 00:08:02,918
KIYOTSUGU: Hey, Nura!

154
00:08:02,951 --> 00:08:03,785
What took you?

155
00:08:03,818 --> 00:08:05,851
-I was cleanup monitor today.

156
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:07,185
Say, where's Kana?

157
00:08:10,018 --> 00:08:10,918
[bells]

[bells]

159
00:08:18,351 --> 00:08:19,818
-Found you.

160
00:08:26,718 --> 00:08:30,618
A very happy 13th
birthday to you.

161
00:08:30,651 --> 00:08:34,885
As I promised, I've
come for you, Kana.

162
00:08:34,918 --> 00:08:35,885
-No!

163
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:37,351
-Let's play, Kana.

164
00:08:37,385 --> 00:08:40,785
Let's pick up where we
left off seven years ago.

165
00:08:40,818 --> 00:08:42,751
-I don't know what
you're talking about!

166
00:08:42,785 --> 00:08:43,751
What's happening?

167
00:08:43,785 --> 00:08:45,251
It's like from my dream.

168
00:08:45,285 --> 00:08:46,218
But why?

169
00:08:46,251 --> 00:08:48,185
How?

170
00:08:48,218 --> 00:08:49,218
-A game of tag?

171
00:08:49,251 --> 00:08:52,651
You can't escape me, Kana.

172
00:08:52,685 --> 00:08:53,151
-I know.

173
00:08:53,185 --> 00:08:54,651
I'll do uho.

174
00:08:54,685 --> 00:08:55,651
Oh, no!

175
00:08:55,685 --> 00:08:58,618
I forgot how to do it!

176
00:08:58,651 --> 00:09:01,085
[laughter]

177
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:07,018
-Kana!

178
00:09:07,051 --> 00:09:07,518
-No!

179
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:13,418
The school?

180
00:09:13,451 --> 00:09:14,918
Why?

181
00:09:14,951 --> 00:09:19,851
-A lovely game of tag,
inside the mirror.

182
00:09:19,885 --> 00:09:21,351
[scream]

183
00:09:25,818 --> 00:09:27,518
KANA: How did I get here?

184
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:30,318
I was walking-- no, running
towards the train station.

185
00:09:30,351 --> 00:09:33,051
And yet, somehow I'm
back here at the school.

186
00:09:46,551 --> 00:09:47,251
A purple mirror?

187
00:09:50,118 --> 00:09:54,385
-Kana, you're still
six years old.

188
00:09:54,418 --> 00:09:58,218
When you're older,
let's play again.

189
00:09:58,251 --> 00:10:00,151
I promise, Kana.

190
00:10:00,185 --> 00:10:07,318
I'll come and get you on the
day of your 13th birthday.

191
00:10:07,351 --> 00:10:10,651
-I remember!

192
00:10:10,685 --> 00:10:15,585
-Kana, this room
doesn't have a mirror.

193
00:10:15,618 --> 00:10:16,785
It's cramped.

194
00:10:16,818 --> 00:10:19,951
So cramped!

195
00:10:19,985 --> 00:10:20,985
RIKUO: Ungaikyo?

196
00:10:21,018 --> 00:10:22,318
KIYOTSUGU: You know about it?

197
00:10:22,351 --> 00:10:23,385
-Mm-mm.

198
00:10:23,418 --> 00:10:24,818
RIKUO (VOICEOVER):
I've never heard of it.

199
00:10:24,851 --> 00:10:28,985
Maybe it's a rogue Yokai that
was expelled from another clan.

200
00:10:29,018 --> 00:10:32,551
So anyway, you were saying that
it's Kana's birthday today?

201
00:10:32,585 --> 00:10:33,585
-That's right.

202
00:10:33,618 --> 00:10:36,151
I just gave her a
great birthday present.

203
00:10:36,185 --> 00:10:37,951
I have one just like it, myself.

204
00:10:37,985 --> 00:10:39,318
-That's really gross.

205
00:10:39,351 --> 00:10:40,585
-That's so rude!

206
00:10:40,618 --> 00:10:43,585
It's a very cute doll
of me as a Yokai.

207
00:10:43,618 --> 00:10:45,518
But that's not all.

208
00:10:45,551 --> 00:10:46,918
-Gah.

209
00:10:46,951 --> 00:10:49,485
I can't get out!

210
00:10:49,518 --> 00:10:49,985
-No!

211
00:10:54,451 --> 00:10:55,318
Mirrors.

212
00:10:55,351 --> 00:10:57,485
He comes out through mirrors.

213
00:10:57,518 --> 00:11:00,451
I have to run!

214
00:11:00,485 --> 00:11:03,818
[buzzing] What's that?

215
00:11:03,851 --> 00:11:04,585
What's going on?

216
00:11:07,951 --> 00:11:08,651
KIYOTSUGU: Hello!

217
00:11:08,685 --> 00:11:11,118
Can you hear me?

218
00:11:11,151 --> 00:11:12,651
-Kiyotsugu?

219
00:11:12,685 --> 00:11:14,351
[laughter]

220
00:11:14,385 --> 00:11:15,718
-Did I surprise you?

221
00:11:15,751 --> 00:11:17,685
That cute Yokai doll
I gave you today

222
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:19,718
has a cellphone built into it.

223
00:11:19,751 --> 00:11:22,718
It's how the Kiyojuji paranormal
patrol will communicate.

224
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:25,618
-Are you there?

225
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:26,551
-Ah!

226
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:27,018
Help!

227
00:11:27,051 --> 00:11:28,451
Help me!

228
00:11:28,485 --> 00:11:32,285
I'm being attacked by a monster
A horrible mirror monster!

229
00:11:32,318 --> 00:11:33,251
-Ienaga!

230
00:11:33,285 --> 00:11:35,651
-A mirror monster?

231
00:11:35,685 --> 00:11:38,851
-You mean-- Kana, where are you?

232
00:11:38,885 --> 00:11:42,651
-In one of the boys
restrooms on campus.

233
00:11:42,685 --> 00:11:44,051
-Found you!

234
00:11:44,085 --> 00:11:45,818
Ha ha ha ha!

235
00:11:45,851 --> 00:11:46,518
KIYOTSUGU: Hello?

236
00:11:46,551 --> 00:11:49,451
Hello?

237
00:11:49,485 --> 00:11:49,951
Ienaga!

238
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:06,925
-Hurry!

239
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,259
We have to find her!

240
00:12:08,292 --> 00:12:09,025
-All right.

241
00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:10,392
Which boys restroom?

242
00:12:10,425 --> 00:12:11,725
-Kiyotsugu, you go that way.

243
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:15,425
I'll look this way.

244
00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:15,992
-Ah--

245
00:12:16,025 --> 00:12:16,925
-She's not here.

246
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:21,959
-You in here?

247
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:23,025
-Kiyotsugu!

248
00:12:23,059 --> 00:12:24,825
Hey, wait, I'm here!

249
00:12:24,859 --> 00:12:27,525
Why can't you see me?

250
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:30,859
-She's not here, either.

251
00:12:30,892 --> 00:12:33,592
-No one will come for you.

252
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,125
No one.

253
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:36,059
Let's play.

254
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:39,492
Kana!

255
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:40,492
[scream]

256
00:12:40,525 --> 00:12:42,759
RIKUO: Kana!

257
00:12:42,792 --> 00:12:43,959
-Rikuo!

258
00:12:43,992 --> 00:12:47,159
-How can he see us in here?

259
00:12:47,192 --> 00:12:49,492
This place is just
for me and Kana!

260
00:12:54,425 --> 00:12:54,892
-No!

261
00:12:59,359 --> 00:13:01,292
-Kana!

262
00:13:01,325 --> 00:13:04,225
-I'm-- being pulled in!

263
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:05,192
[laughter]

264
00:13:05,225 --> 00:13:05,692
-No!

265
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:17,225
It's you again.

266
00:13:17,259 --> 00:13:21,392
-Never lay a hand on a
woman in my territory.

267
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:22,559
-Who are you?

268
00:13:22,592 --> 00:13:25,292
A Yokai?

269
00:13:25,325 --> 00:13:27,125
Don't get in my way!

270
00:13:30,992 --> 00:13:34,825
[laughter] How's this?

271
00:13:34,859 --> 00:13:38,159
I bet you can't tell
which one is me!

272
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:38,692
-You fool.

273
00:13:49,859 --> 00:13:54,325
Since I don't know, I'll just
destroy all of you at once.

274
00:13:54,359 --> 00:13:56,259
[groan]

275
00:14:05,259 --> 00:14:06,025
-Th-- thank you.

276
00:14:09,525 --> 00:14:10,459
Um--

277
00:14:10,492 --> 00:14:12,692
KIYOTSUGU: Ienaga!

278
00:14:12,725 --> 00:14:13,525
-Did you find her?

279
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:14,859
-No, not yet.

280
00:14:14,892 --> 00:14:17,059
-Damn, where the
heck could she be?

281
00:14:17,092 --> 00:14:17,692
KANA: Everyone!

282
00:14:17,725 --> 00:14:19,625
-Huh?

283
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:20,559
-Ienaga!

284
00:14:20,592 --> 00:14:22,192
-Where's the Yokai?

285
00:14:22,225 --> 00:14:23,125
-Oh, sorry.

286
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:25,859
Um, I, uh, I made a mistake.

287
00:14:25,892 --> 00:14:30,125
I kind of dozed off, and thought
this doll was a real Yokai.

288
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:32,259
So everything's fine, really.

289
00:14:32,292 --> 00:14:33,559
See you tomorow.

290
00:14:33,592 --> 00:14:36,425
-Huh?

291
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:36,925
-Hey!

292
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:37,425
Wait!

293
00:14:41,325 --> 00:14:43,859
Tell me, who are you?

294
00:14:43,892 --> 00:14:46,292
You came when that
rat Yokai trapped us,

295
00:14:46,325 --> 00:14:48,759
and then once again
on our field trip.

296
00:14:48,792 --> 00:14:53,425
And now-- it seems wherever
Rikuo is, you appear.

297
00:14:53,459 --> 00:15:02,525
Are you-- could
you be-- don't go.

298
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:07,659
Can you stay with
me a little longer?

299
00:15:07,692 --> 00:15:12,259
Please tell me more
about yourself.

300
00:15:12,292 --> 00:15:13,892
-So, you don't mind?

301
00:15:13,925 --> 00:15:14,925
Being scared?

302
00:15:30,825 --> 00:15:32,925
This way.

303
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:33,925
Is something wrong?

304
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:34,892
Are you too scared?

305
00:15:38,092 --> 00:15:39,525
-Mm-mm.

306
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:41,392
I'm not because I'm here.

307
00:15:41,425 --> 00:15:41,892
With you.

308
00:15:46,059 --> 00:15:47,825
-After you.

309
00:15:47,859 --> 00:15:49,792
-Um, where are we?

310
00:15:49,825 --> 00:15:52,359
-You want to know
more about me, right?

311
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:01,825
I'll show you everything
you want to know.

312
00:16:01,859 --> 00:16:03,025
-Uh, well, OK.

313
00:16:18,992 --> 00:16:21,892
-Good evening!

314
00:16:21,925 --> 00:16:25,125
Welcome to our
place, Bakenekoya,

315
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:27,659
the best Yokai
restaurant there is.

316
00:16:27,692 --> 00:16:29,259
-Come on in!

317
00:16:29,292 --> 00:16:30,459
-Hey, there.

318
00:16:30,492 --> 00:16:31,292
-Master.

319
00:16:31,325 --> 00:16:32,959
-You've got quite a place here.

320
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,925
Looks like business is good.

321
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,359
-You can count on me.

322
00:16:36,392 --> 00:16:38,325
I promise, I'll
never screw up again.

323
00:16:42,092 --> 00:16:44,292
Say, master, isn't she
the same human girl

324
00:16:44,325 --> 00:16:46,392
who was kidnapped by Kyuso?

325
00:16:46,425 --> 00:16:50,292
You sure it's OK to bring
her to a place like this?

326
00:16:50,325 --> 00:16:53,425
-Say, Ryota Neko, I
need a favor from you.

327
00:16:56,192 --> 00:16:58,225
-There's Yokai everywhere.

328
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:00,759
-You're such a sly dog,
aren't you, master?

329
00:17:00,792 --> 00:17:03,325
-Look at the cute
lover he brought today.

330
00:17:03,359 --> 00:17:04,092
-Lover?

331
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:06,559
GIRL: I'm so jealous.

332
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:08,892
KANA (VOICEOVER): They're
calling him master.

333
00:17:08,925 --> 00:17:12,225
So he really is a Yokai.

334
00:17:12,259 --> 00:17:14,692
-Well, here you go.

335
00:17:14,725 --> 00:17:17,259
So, what might your name be?

336
00:17:17,292 --> 00:17:18,725
-Kana.

337
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:19,959
-How old are you?

338
00:17:19,992 --> 00:17:20,659
I'm 12.

339
00:17:20,692 --> 00:17:22,625
Actually, I'm 13 today.

340
00:17:22,659 --> 00:17:23,759
WAITER: It's your birthday?

341
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,692
Hey, that's great!

342
00:17:25,725 --> 00:17:27,925
-So you just became
an adult today?

343
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:29,725
I think that's wonderful!

344
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:32,392
-I'm sure you'll make
a terrific Yokai.

345
00:17:32,425 --> 00:17:35,025
-So what kind of Yokai are you?

346
00:17:35,059 --> 00:17:36,425
-Um, I--

347
00:17:36,459 --> 00:17:38,325
-If they find out
that you're human,

348
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:42,092
they might decide to eat you.

349
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:43,225
-Master--

350
00:17:43,259 --> 00:17:45,259
-Come on, don't
leave us hanging.

351
00:17:45,292 --> 00:17:47,692
-Well, um-- you see--

352
00:17:47,725 --> 00:17:48,925
KANA (VOICEOVER): What'll I do?

353
00:17:48,959 --> 00:17:52,292
Would they really eat me?

354
00:17:52,325 --> 00:17:55,225
-A mirror!

355
00:17:55,259 --> 00:17:57,792
Is-- this for me?

356
00:17:57,825 --> 00:18:00,059
-It's your birthday.

357
00:18:00,092 --> 00:18:01,259
So just take it.

358
00:18:01,292 --> 00:18:01,759
-Thank you.

359
00:18:01,792 --> 00:18:02,759
I love it.

360
00:18:07,259 --> 00:18:09,225
GIRL: Oh!

361
00:18:09,259 --> 00:18:11,659
This doll is so cute.

362
00:18:11,692 --> 00:18:13,159
Where do they sell these?

363
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:14,525
-Oh, well, that's--

364
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:15,659
-Let me see it.

365
00:18:15,692 --> 00:18:17,059
-Oh, so cute!

366
00:18:17,092 --> 00:18:19,192
-I want one, too.

367
00:18:19,225 --> 00:18:22,292
KANA (VOICEOVER): So this is
what the Yokai world is like.

368
00:18:22,325 --> 00:18:25,692
It's now how I imagined it.

369
00:18:25,725 --> 00:18:26,392
-Oh.

370
00:18:26,425 --> 00:18:27,992
So cute.

371
00:18:28,025 --> 00:18:30,959
Is this little
child a Yokai, too?

372
00:18:30,992 --> 00:18:31,825
-Yeah.

373
00:18:31,859 --> 00:18:32,592
He's tasty.

374
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:34,925
-Don't say that!

375
00:18:34,959 --> 00:18:37,225
-Wow, there are so
many kinds of Yokai.

376
00:18:41,192 --> 00:18:42,659
-My, my.

377
00:18:42,692 --> 00:18:43,992
I'm stuffed.

378
00:18:44,025 --> 00:18:46,992
The old lady at the sweet
shop sure can cook up a storm.

379
00:18:50,025 --> 00:18:51,625
Eh?

380
00:18:51,659 --> 00:18:53,425
-I'm so worried
about the master.

381
00:18:53,459 --> 00:18:56,559
I can't believe how
late he's staying out.

382
00:18:56,592 --> 00:18:58,992
You said, leave it to me,
I'll take care of the master.

383
00:18:59,025 --> 00:19:02,359
How could you just
lose him like that?

384
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:04,725
[groan]

385
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:05,225
-Ow!

386
00:19:09,525 --> 00:19:13,992
-Can I have another glass
of catnip juice, please?

387
00:19:14,025 --> 00:19:17,659
-Well, I'm very glad she had
a good time here tonight.

388
00:19:17,692 --> 00:19:20,392
-Yeah.

389
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:21,325
Thanks for the food.

390
00:19:30,925 --> 00:19:31,992
-Hm.

391
00:19:32,025 --> 00:19:35,192
So, Rikuo didn't come
home until morning?

392
00:19:35,225 --> 00:19:36,025
-No.

393
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:37,792
It seems he didn't.

394
00:19:37,825 --> 00:19:39,592
[laughter]

395
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,825
-The boy is becoming
quite busy, eh?

396
00:19:41,859 --> 00:19:42,692
-Yes.

397
00:19:42,725 --> 00:19:45,159
I suppose you're right, Father.

398
00:19:45,192 --> 00:19:47,359
RIKUO (VOICEOVER): Oh,
what was I thinking?

399
00:19:47,392 --> 00:19:49,859
I shouldn't have done
what I did last night.

400
00:19:49,892 --> 00:19:51,159
-Pardon me.

401
00:19:51,192 --> 00:19:54,459
Mater, what were you doing
until so early this morning?

402
00:19:54,492 --> 00:19:55,459
-Huh?

403
00:19:55,492 --> 00:19:57,225
Well, um, you see--

404
00:19:57,259 --> 00:19:58,059
KANA: Morning.

405
00:19:58,092 --> 00:19:58,892
-Oh.

406
00:19:58,925 --> 00:19:59,592
Kana.

407
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:00,959
Sorry about last night.

408
00:20:00,992 --> 00:20:01,892
I mean--

409
00:20:01,925 --> 00:20:03,125
-Last night!

410
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:09,292
-Um, say, Rikuo-- I want
to ask you something.

411
00:20:09,325 --> 00:20:12,192
Come on.

412
00:20:12,225 --> 00:20:13,159
-What happened?

413
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:19,625
-So Kana, you wanted
to ask me something?

414
00:20:19,659 --> 00:20:21,525
-I've been going over
and over everything

415
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:23,659
that's been happening up to now.

416
00:20:23,692 --> 00:20:26,492
And it seems whenever
you're there, he's there.

417
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:29,259
Even yesterday.

418
00:20:29,292 --> 00:20:33,159
Rikuo, could it be
that he and you--

419
00:20:33,192 --> 00:20:34,559
RIKUO (VOICEOVER): This is bad.

420
00:20:34,592 --> 00:20:37,359
She knows?

421
00:20:37,392 --> 00:20:39,592
-Are friends with each other?

422
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,559
-Ah?

423
00:20:41,592 --> 00:20:42,959
Huh?

424
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:45,659
-Please, tell me more about him.

425
00:20:45,692 --> 00:20:47,625
-I don't understand.

426
00:20:47,659 --> 00:20:49,525
Why do you want to know?

427
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:52,059
-Well, does it really matter?

428
00:20:52,092 --> 00:20:55,259
It's got nothing to do with you.

429
00:20:55,292 --> 00:20:58,892
[screaming]

430
00:20:58,925 --> 00:20:59,392
-Hm.

431
00:21:04,892 --> 00:21:07,025
[humming]

432
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:11,559
-Oh, sorry.

433
00:21:11,592 --> 00:21:12,925
We won't be open for a while.

434
00:21:12,959 --> 00:21:13,425
Ah!

435
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:19,925
-What was that sound?

436
00:21:19,959 --> 00:21:21,492
It was awfully loud.

437
00:21:21,525 --> 00:21:22,959
Saburo Neko?

438
00:21:22,992 --> 00:21:24,559
What happened to you?

439
00:21:24,592 --> 00:21:25,825
-Huh?

440
00:21:25,859 --> 00:21:28,392
Must be from that
last gust of wind.

441
00:21:28,425 --> 00:21:29,525
Anyway, I'm fine.

442
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:31,525
My clothes just got
a little torn up.

443
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:32,892
-I see.

444
00:21:32,925 --> 00:21:33,992
-I'm going to go change.

445
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:41,825
MAN: A little torn up?

446
00:21:41,859 --> 00:21:44,892
They're so clueless.

447
00:21:44,925 --> 00:21:46,359
-The rumors were right.

448
00:21:46,392 --> 00:21:48,459
The Nura clan is a
bunch of softies.

449
00:21:48,492 --> 00:21:51,459
Good thing we came
to spy on them.

450
00:21:51,492 --> 00:21:53,159
-Ukiyoe Town.

451
00:21:53,192 --> 00:21:55,459
The headquarters
of the Nura clan.

452
00:21:55,492 --> 00:21:58,625
They don't realize their
days are numbered here.

453
00:21:58,659 --> 00:22:02,059
They've got a week at most.

454
00:22:02,092 --> 00:22:03,025
[laughter]

455
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:12,997
[theme music]

456
00:23:38,835 --> 00:23:41,135
AOTABO: The button on the
school uniform is killing me.

457
00:23:41,168 --> 00:23:42,601
TSURARA: Stop
being so silly, Ao.

458
00:23:42,635 --> 00:23:45,068
You have that thing
unbuttoned all the time.

459
00:23:45,101 --> 00:23:47,035
AOTABO: Not as silly
as that scarf of yours.

460
00:23:47,068 --> 00:23:48,235
RIKUO: Come on, you guys.

461
00:23:48,268 --> 00:23:52,401
Next time, The Vanguard
Wind Blows From The West.
