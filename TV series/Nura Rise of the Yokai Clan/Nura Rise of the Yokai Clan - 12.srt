1
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,500
NARRATOR: In days of
old, people feared Yokai.

2
00:00:13,533 --> 00:00:17,866
The one who stood at the helm
and led the night parade of 100

3
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:23,233
demons was known as the
supreme commander of the Yokai.

4
00:00:23,266 --> 00:00:28,433
They had another name for
him-- the Lord of Pandemonium.

5
00:00:28,466 --> 00:00:31,266
Nurarihyon.

6
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,300
[theme song]

7
00:02:26,908 --> 00:02:32,642
MAN: The time has come when
we can finally leave this land

8
00:02:32,675 --> 00:02:36,175
and ascend to the capital
to take our rightful place.

9
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:40,742
MAN: It is all because of
Inugamigyobu's beckoning.

10
00:02:40,775 --> 00:02:46,208
He is, without doubt, destined
to rule over this world.

11
00:02:46,242 --> 00:02:48,442
MAN: The seven
phantom travelers--

12
00:02:48,475 --> 00:02:50,842
normally they are not
visible to the human eye.

13
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:54,275
But it is said they can be seen
if you peer between something--

14
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:56,408
like a cow's legs, for example.

15
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:59,375
Misfortune befalls
all who are unlucky

16
00:02:59,408 --> 00:03:01,975
enough to encounter this group.

17
00:03:02,008 --> 00:03:05,175
Such an encounter could
even result in death.

18
00:03:14,675 --> 00:03:16,675
GIRL: Tamazuki and
the Seven Shadows.

19
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:20,375
-Hm?

20
00:03:24,042 --> 00:03:25,175
-Karasu Tengu?

21
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:27,775
-Supreme Commander, where
have you run off to?

22
00:03:35,475 --> 00:03:36,975
-Karasu Tengu.

23
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:38,542
Which way did he go?

24
00:03:38,575 --> 00:03:39,908
-Master.

25
00:03:39,942 --> 00:03:42,042
-Ao, Kubinashi.

26
00:03:42,075 --> 00:03:44,842
-Did you see Lord Karasu Tengu
flying by the school just now?

27
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:45,608
-Yeah.

28
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,775
He looked upset.

29
00:03:47,808 --> 00:03:49,208
-Do you know what's going on?

30
00:03:49,242 --> 00:03:50,342
-No.

31
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:51,942
I mean, he flew right
by and didn't even seem

32
00:03:51,975 --> 00:03:53,542
to notice us at all.

33
00:03:53,575 --> 00:03:55,642
-But it must be
something very serious

34
00:03:55,675 --> 00:03:58,342
for him to have
gone off like that.

35
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,242
-I'm gonna go talk to him.

36
00:04:00,275 --> 00:04:01,008
-All right.

37
00:04:01,042 --> 00:04:01,875
I'll go with you, master.

38
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,442
-Don't bother.

39
00:04:04,475 --> 00:04:05,108
-Gozu.

40
00:04:05,142 --> 00:04:07,608
Mezu.

41
00:04:07,642 --> 00:04:09,175
-What are you guys doing here?

42
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:12,308
-Karasu is making
us work like slaves.

43
00:04:12,342 --> 00:04:14,708
That old geezer of yours
went and disappeared,

44
00:04:14,742 --> 00:04:16,542
so we gotta go out
and look for him now.

45
00:04:16,575 --> 00:04:18,408
-What's the big deal?

46
00:04:18,442 --> 00:04:20,508
Grandpa disappears all the time.

47
00:04:20,542 --> 00:04:21,742
-Yes, that's true.

48
00:04:21,775 --> 00:04:23,975
But Lord Hihi's unfortunate
demise just happened.

49
00:04:24,008 --> 00:04:26,475
If something should happen
to the Supreme Commander

50
00:04:26,508 --> 00:04:28,308
while he was out unattended--

51
00:04:28,342 --> 00:04:31,142
-Kubinashi, cut it out.

52
00:04:31,175 --> 00:04:32,475
Grandpa will be just fine.

53
00:04:32,508 --> 00:04:36,908
-In any case, we'll help
Karasu look for the old geezer.

54
00:04:36,942 --> 00:04:39,775
There's no need for you to
go wandering around too.

55
00:04:39,808 --> 00:04:41,075
-That's right.

56
00:04:41,108 --> 00:04:44,208
Especially when you're so
helpless during the daytime.

57
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,408
-I understand.

58
00:04:45,442 --> 00:04:48,542
I'm counting on
you, Gozu and Mezu.

59
00:04:48,575 --> 00:04:49,675
-Hm?

60
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:52,408
It's a big pain in the
ass, but what the heck.

61
00:04:52,442 --> 00:04:53,742
Damn it all.

62
00:04:53,775 --> 00:04:55,575
When you've got to
guard the main family,

63
00:04:55,608 --> 00:04:57,375
you've really got no choice.

64
00:04:57,408 --> 00:05:00,308
-Hey, Gozumaru, you're blushing.

65
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:02,942
-Uh-- would you just
shut up already?

66
00:05:02,975 --> 00:05:03,775
-Ow!

67
00:05:03,808 --> 00:05:04,842
-Come on, let's go.

68
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:06,708
-All right.

69
00:05:06,742 --> 00:05:08,442
-What's with those two?

70
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:09,442
-I really don't know.

71
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,242
But they seem to be
quite dependable.

72
00:05:11,275 --> 00:05:12,308
-Yeah.

73
00:05:12,342 --> 00:05:14,175
And not only that,
Gyuki trust's them more

74
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:17,008
than anyone else in his clan.

75
00:05:17,042 --> 00:05:21,642
I know I said he'd be all right,
but where'd Grandpa go, anyway?

76
00:05:21,675 --> 00:05:23,308
Everyone's so worried.

77
00:05:23,342 --> 00:05:26,075
-He's probably just
out walking around.

78
00:05:26,108 --> 00:05:27,708
He'll stop somewhere
for some good food

79
00:05:27,742 --> 00:05:29,308
and then make his
way back home again.

80
00:05:29,342 --> 00:05:32,842
-I sure hope so.

81
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,875
-Hey, we're back.

82
00:05:34,908 --> 00:05:36,675
-Oh, you two.

83
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:38,108
Where did you guys run off to?

84
00:05:38,142 --> 00:05:39,808
I wasn't done talking yet.

85
00:05:39,842 --> 00:05:41,608
-Huh?

86
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:42,775
We're sorry.

87
00:05:42,808 --> 00:05:43,842
-They're always together.

88
00:05:47,008 --> 00:05:49,508
-We ran into a mutual
friend that we haven't

89
00:05:49,542 --> 00:05:51,742
seen in a really long
time, and we just

90
00:05:51,775 --> 00:05:53,275
got to talking and stuff.

91
00:05:53,308 --> 00:05:54,675
Isn't that right, Nura?

92
00:05:54,708 --> 00:06:00,675
-Uh, yes, well-- ah, ah, Kana.

93
00:06:13,408 --> 00:06:15,842
-Did you think a young girl
like me was easy to defeat?

94
00:06:22,542 --> 00:06:25,608
-Supreme Commander,
did you see that?

95
00:06:25,642 --> 00:06:26,575
-Not bad.

96
00:06:30,408 --> 00:06:31,342
Behind you!

97
00:06:41,842 --> 00:06:42,842
YURA (VOICEOVER): Dammit.

98
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:45,975
I failed to take out the boss.

99
00:06:46,008 --> 00:06:47,408
-Lady Yura.

100
00:06:47,442 --> 00:06:48,042
-I'm all right.

101
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:50,475
This is nothing.

102
00:06:50,508 --> 00:06:52,442
YURA (VOICEOVER): This is bad.

103
00:06:52,475 --> 00:06:55,575
When he attacked I got
some of his poison on me.

104
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:01,142
-Tanro, Rokuson!

105
00:07:01,175 --> 00:07:04,208
If I could create an
opening for just an instant.

106
00:07:04,242 --> 00:07:05,308
-You mustn't.

107
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:06,608
-Bukyoku--

108
00:07:06,642 --> 00:07:09,242
-You cannot continue to control
four shikigami at the same

109
00:07:09,275 --> 00:07:10,275
time.

110
00:07:10,308 --> 00:07:12,475
Your body will not
hold out, Lady Yura.

111
00:07:12,508 --> 00:07:13,508
-What are you saying?

112
00:07:13,542 --> 00:07:15,442
Risking one's life
to exterminate Yokai

113
00:07:15,475 --> 00:07:17,908
is the duty of an onmyouji.

114
00:07:17,942 --> 00:07:18,408
Rokuson!

115
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:22,875
Tanro, no!

116
00:07:26,342 --> 00:07:26,808
Bukyoku!

117
00:07:30,308 --> 00:07:31,275
Bukyoku!

118
00:07:31,308 --> 00:07:32,275
Enough!

119
00:07:32,308 --> 00:07:33,708
Get back right now!

120
00:07:36,275 --> 00:07:38,975
-Unfortunately, I can't
keep wasting my time playing

121
00:07:39,008 --> 00:07:40,175
with you.

122
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:41,208
So long.

123
00:07:41,242 --> 00:07:41,742
-Hold it!

124
00:07:47,542 --> 00:07:48,008
Mr. Nura!

125
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:54,675
-Natto Kozo!

126
00:07:57,442 --> 00:08:00,808
[laughter]

127
00:08:00,842 --> 00:08:03,308
-I'm so sorry to
keep you waiting.

128
00:08:03,342 --> 00:08:04,775
-Supreme Commander!

129
00:08:13,908 --> 00:08:14,375
-Dammit!

130
00:08:18,575 --> 00:08:22,175
-That girl won't be able to make
it up here for a little while.

131
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:24,242
You'd thought you'd
escape, but instead you've

132
00:08:24,275 --> 00:08:25,875
been driven into a
corner, Nurarihyon.

133
00:08:33,742 --> 00:08:35,642
-You hear that?

134
00:08:35,675 --> 00:08:37,042
-I do.

135
00:08:37,075 --> 00:08:41,642
It's the sound of
Muchi's poisonous wind.

136
00:08:41,675 --> 00:08:44,908
-The present Nura
clan is vulnerable.

137
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:49,208
Take out its current leader and
it will completely fall apart.

138
00:08:49,242 --> 00:08:54,008
And that will spell the end
of the Nura clan's night

139
00:08:54,042 --> 00:08:55,708
parade of 100 demons.

140
00:08:59,075 --> 00:09:02,742
-Tell me, Muchi, are you
the one who killed Hihi?

141
00:09:06,008 --> 00:09:07,942
How regrettable.

142
00:09:07,975 --> 00:09:11,275
He pledged loyalty to
me a long time ago,

143
00:09:11,308 --> 00:09:14,575
and was one of the clan's
most respected veterans.

144
00:09:14,608 --> 00:09:16,475
We would hang out
from time to time,

145
00:09:16,508 --> 00:09:18,908
going to cafes for a cup of tea.

146
00:09:18,942 --> 00:09:20,575
-He was right.

147
00:09:20,608 --> 00:09:22,642
The Nura clan is so lax.

148
00:09:33,675 --> 00:09:35,842
After all, their most
high-ranking officer

149
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,408
was nothing but a weakling!

150
00:09:40,108 --> 00:09:42,408
It won't even take a
week to destroy you all!

151
00:09:55,942 --> 00:09:57,942
-Do you know what you lack?

152
00:09:57,975 --> 00:09:58,416
Elegance.

153
00:10:04,549 --> 00:10:05,416
-Oh yeah?

154
00:10:11,949 --> 00:10:14,349
You're running away from
my whip, but it's no use!

155
00:10:18,716 --> 00:10:19,183
-Whoa.

156
00:10:23,383 --> 00:10:26,416
-I'm trembling with excitement.

157
00:10:26,449 --> 00:10:29,649
Now I get to have the honor
of killing a big-shot like you

158
00:10:29,683 --> 00:10:31,883
with my own hands!

159
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,683
There's nowhere to run.

160
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,649
You will be sucked into
my whirlpool of wind

161
00:10:35,683 --> 00:10:38,616
and be torn to shreds!

162
00:10:38,649 --> 00:10:40,383
Mystic, eight balls of wind!

163
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,316
It's useless!

164
00:10:47,349 --> 00:10:49,449
Even if you manage
to block my wind,

165
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:51,916
you can't escape
from this poison!

166
00:10:51,949 --> 00:10:53,383
[cackling]

167
00:11:04,249 --> 00:11:06,216
He bounced the wind back.

168
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:07,049
No.

169
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,549
There's no way he could do that.

170
00:11:12,849 --> 00:11:14,016
He's gone?

171
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:15,383
Impossible.

172
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:16,783
I know I had him cornered.

173
00:11:20,849 --> 00:11:22,416
He's here.

174
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:23,249
He's here.

175
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:25,249
I know it.

176
00:11:25,283 --> 00:11:28,016
He's walking in front of me.

177
00:11:28,049 --> 00:11:34,316
And yet-- why-- why
can't I see where he is?

178
00:11:34,349 --> 00:11:40,249
NURARIHYON: You cannot see as
long as you don't try to see.

179
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:44,116
No matter who you are, when
you encounter an existence that

180
00:11:44,149 --> 00:11:48,616
is far greater than yourself
the fear begins to take over.

181
00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:51,449
Your mind stops to
notice everything else.

182
00:11:51,483 --> 00:11:54,216
So, even if you are
able to see, you

183
00:11:54,249 --> 00:11:56,016
lose the ability to recognize.

184
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:04,183
That is my power.

185
00:12:08,383 --> 00:12:10,349
Nurarihyons, meikyo shizui.

186
00:12:16,749 --> 00:12:21,549
Like the calm surface of
water without any ripples.

187
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:24,916
So, how do you like
my style of fighting?

188
00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:27,049
Quite elegant, eh?

189
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,883
-Damn you.

190
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,549
-Don't bother trying.

191
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,949
My dagger has cut you down,
and so you will not survive.

192
00:12:33,983 --> 00:12:36,249
Tell me one thing
before you die.

193
00:12:36,283 --> 00:12:39,549
Why would a Yokai from Shikoku
go through all this trouble

194
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,716
just to come after me?

195
00:12:41,749 --> 00:12:44,749
-The wind hasn't died down yet.

196
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:15,060
-Mr. Nura!

197
00:13:15,093 --> 00:13:16,860
-Huh?

198
00:13:16,893 --> 00:13:18,027
Oh, young girl.

199
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,627
-Are you all right, Mr. Nura?

200
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,360
You're safe now.

201
00:13:24,393 --> 00:13:26,227
I'm here to protect you.

202
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,593
Where's the Yokai?

203
00:13:31,627 --> 00:13:32,560
Where'd it go?

204
00:13:32,593 --> 00:13:33,527
-Huh?

205
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,727
Oh, that's thing.

206
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,827
It was here and
then it went away.

207
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,660
There's no need
to worry yourself.

208
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:41,727
Nothing really happened.

209
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,193
-It didn't?

210
00:13:48,993 --> 00:13:50,393
-Oh, no, that's impossible!

211
00:13:50,427 --> 00:13:52,560
Something must have happened
while it was up here!

212
00:13:52,593 --> 00:13:53,960
I know something happened!

213
00:13:53,993 --> 00:13:55,393
I know it!

214
00:13:55,427 --> 00:13:57,493
-Oh, now, now.

215
00:13:57,527 --> 00:13:59,927
I was hiding when
he stormed up here.

216
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,827
It went on a horrible, violent
rampage, and after a while

217
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:05,427
it just went away,
like the wind.

218
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,293
-Huh.

219
00:14:06,327 --> 00:14:07,360
Like the wind?

220
00:14:07,393 --> 00:14:08,393
-Yes, yes.

221
00:14:08,427 --> 00:14:09,060
That's right.

222
00:14:09,093 --> 00:14:09,727
And you see?

223
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,660
I'm not hurt at all.

224
00:14:10,693 --> 00:14:12,493
I'm perfectly fine.

225
00:14:12,527 --> 00:14:13,293
-Ugh.

226
00:14:13,327 --> 00:14:15,260
I let another Yokai escape.

227
00:14:15,293 --> 00:14:18,393
And it's all because I'm
so weak and hopeless.

228
00:14:18,427 --> 00:14:20,760
I'm just no good as an onmyouji.

229
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:21,460
-That's not true.

230
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:22,793
You saved me.

231
00:14:22,827 --> 00:14:24,760
Without your kind help I would
have most certainly died.

232
00:14:24,793 --> 00:14:25,560
-Really?

233
00:14:25,593 --> 00:14:27,427
You really do feel that way?

234
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,927
You're sure you're not hurt?

235
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,393
You're not sick or anything?

236
00:14:35,393 --> 00:14:36,927
I'm so glad.

237
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,960
I'm glad that I
could protect you.

238
00:14:39,993 --> 00:14:43,560
A very good man like you.

239
00:14:43,593 --> 00:14:46,860
-I know you'll become a
fine onmyouji some day.

240
00:14:46,893 --> 00:14:48,793
-Oh, I feel so much better!

241
00:14:48,827 --> 00:14:50,527
And I'm getting hungry, too.

242
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,227
Say, Mr. Nura, how
about coming over

243
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,427
to my house for
some eggs over rice?

244
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,693
I'll even add some natto.

245
00:14:59,293 --> 00:14:59,760
Mr. Nura?

246
00:15:08,827 --> 00:15:10,260
-Oh, Supreme Commander!

247
00:15:10,293 --> 00:15:12,127
I'm so glad you're OK.

248
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,460
-I'm happy to see that you
fared well yourself, Natto.

249
00:15:15,493 --> 00:15:17,393
-Oh, no, never mind me.

250
00:15:17,427 --> 00:15:19,193
We need to hurry
home right away.

251
00:15:19,227 --> 00:15:21,493
Karasu will scold us
if he learns something

252
00:15:21,527 --> 00:15:23,093
like this has happened to you.

253
00:15:23,127 --> 00:15:24,493
-I'm not going home.

254
00:15:24,527 --> 00:15:25,727
-Huh?

255
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,227
-There's something I want
to personally look into.

256
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:32,060
Tell them I won't be coming
home for a little while.

257
00:15:32,093 --> 00:15:32,693
-What?

258
00:15:32,727 --> 00:15:33,793
You can't do that!

259
00:15:33,827 --> 00:15:36,993
-Or would you prefer
to come with me, Natto?

260
00:15:37,027 --> 00:15:38,993
I could certainly
use some company.

261
00:15:39,027 --> 00:15:39,793
-Wait!

262
00:15:39,827 --> 00:15:40,760
Supreme Commander!

263
00:15:49,927 --> 00:15:52,260
-Hey, Rikuo, is
something bothering you?

264
00:15:52,293 --> 00:15:53,060
-Oh.

265
00:15:53,093 --> 00:15:55,727
No, it's nothing.

266
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,827
-Are you sure?

267
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,393
I mean, you left the
club all of a sudden,

268
00:15:58,427 --> 00:16:01,393
and then you've been really
quiet ever since you came back.

269
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:02,660
Something happen with Oikawa?

270
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,627
-No, you see, Kiyotsugu was
just rambling on and on today.

271
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,293
And I just got
tired of listening.

272
00:16:13,327 --> 00:16:15,693
So I decided to take a break--

273
00:16:15,727 --> 00:16:18,160
-Being a bodyguard is so boring.

274
00:16:18,193 --> 00:16:19,893
-Shh.

275
00:16:19,927 --> 00:16:22,727
-I have to say, the Yokai
knowledge he demonstrated today

276
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,460
was really impressive.

277
00:16:24,493 --> 00:16:26,960
I wonder where he finds
those interesting facts.

278
00:16:26,993 --> 00:16:29,127
-Considering how much you
dislike Yokai and all,

279
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,993
his stories must
be very unpleasant

280
00:16:31,027 --> 00:16:32,693
for you to listen to, Ienaga.

281
00:16:32,727 --> 00:16:33,627
-Oh, no, no.

282
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,960
Not at all.

283
00:16:35,993 --> 00:16:38,293
I think it's really educational.

284
00:16:38,327 --> 00:16:39,793
And-- how can I put it?

285
00:16:39,827 --> 00:16:42,827
The more I learn about them,
the scarier they seem to me.

286
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:46,527
Yokai are supposed to be scary,
and that's perfectly normal.

287
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,227
And rather appealing.

288
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,127
-What the hell is
she talking about?

289
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:51,927
-Oh, man.

290
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,893
This is bad.

291
00:16:53,927 --> 00:16:55,360
-Master--

292
00:16:55,393 --> 00:16:56,827
-What is it, Tsurara?

293
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:57,827
You look mad.

294
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,193
-Spill it, master.

295
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:01,593
What exactly happened
between you and that-- that

296
00:17:01,627 --> 00:17:02,727
girl the other night?

297
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,893
-Hey, take it easy.

298
00:17:03,927 --> 00:17:04,693
Nothing happened.

299
00:17:04,727 --> 00:17:06,260
Really.

300
00:17:06,293 --> 00:17:07,093
-No, master.

301
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:10,060
A woman can sense these things.

302
00:17:10,093 --> 00:17:12,560
That girl-- ever since that
day all she talks about

303
00:17:12,593 --> 00:17:13,893
is your night form.

304
00:17:13,927 --> 00:17:19,693
Maybe you haven't noticed, but
she's in L, in O, in V and E

305
00:17:19,727 --> 00:17:20,660
with you!

306
00:17:20,693 --> 00:17:21,793
-Huh?

307
00:17:21,827 --> 00:17:23,527
Well, that's just crazy!

308
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,893
Besides, this isn't the time
to bring up stuff like that.

309
00:17:25,927 --> 00:17:27,360
-You can't fool me anymore!

310
00:17:27,393 --> 00:17:29,393
What happened that
night between you two?

311
00:17:29,427 --> 00:17:30,860
Tell me the truth.

312
00:17:30,893 --> 00:17:31,560
I want details!

313
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:33,260
-We didn't do anything.

314
00:17:33,293 --> 00:17:35,160
-Why don't you just
come clean already?

315
00:17:35,193 --> 00:17:35,660
-Ao!

316
00:17:39,793 --> 00:17:40,493
Oh.

317
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:41,293
No, no.

318
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:48,327
This is-- girls?

319
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,727
-Oikawa, is your
house this way, too?

320
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,193
The same way as Rikuo?

321
00:17:55,227 --> 00:17:57,127
-Yes it is, Ienaga.

322
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,627
Didn't you know that?

323
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,593
I mean, I thought you and
Nura were good old childhood

324
00:18:01,627 --> 00:18:02,093
friends.

325
00:18:06,093 --> 00:18:08,060
-They seem to be having fun.

326
00:18:08,093 --> 00:18:09,660
-The master is quite
the heartbreaker.

327
00:18:09,693 --> 00:18:11,993
-Yeah, like you should talk.

328
00:18:12,027 --> 00:18:13,593
What's the matter, Kappa?

329
00:18:17,493 --> 00:18:20,160
-What's this Yokai
aura I'm feeling?

330
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,293
-After it!

331
00:18:42,293 --> 00:18:44,460
No one's here.

332
00:18:44,493 --> 00:18:48,093
But I'm sure I sense
the presence of a Yokai.

333
00:18:52,427 --> 00:18:54,760
-Hey, time out.

334
00:18:54,793 --> 00:18:56,627
Why don't the two
of you calm down?

335
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,760
-Uh--

336
00:18:57,793 --> 00:18:58,260
-Master!

337
00:19:03,127 --> 00:19:05,593
-Oh, uh-- excuse me.

338
00:19:05,627 --> 00:19:08,460
-Hello.

339
00:19:08,493 --> 00:19:10,260
You're Rikuo Nura.

340
00:19:10,293 --> 00:19:11,593
Isn't that right?

341
00:19:11,627 --> 00:19:12,927
-Huh?

342
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,593
-And who the hell are you, kid?

343
00:19:15,627 --> 00:19:16,293
-No, Ao.

344
00:19:16,327 --> 00:19:17,460
I mean, uh, Kurata.

345
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,360
-Uh, Rikuo, do you know him?

346
00:19:28,393 --> 00:19:29,627
-No, I don't.

347
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,093
-I guess I didn't need to ask.

348
00:19:34,993 --> 00:19:37,760
I could tell just
by looking at you.

349
00:19:37,793 --> 00:19:39,593
We have much in common.

350
00:19:39,627 --> 00:19:43,060
Young and full of potential.

351
00:19:43,093 --> 00:19:46,860
But most of all, we both
inherited the blood.

352
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:59,360
However, you had
everything handed to you

353
00:19:59,393 --> 00:20:02,327
from the beginning, didn't you?

354
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,427
Whereas Ao sees
everything starting now.

355
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,093
-What do you mean
I had everything

356
00:20:08,127 --> 00:20:09,760
from the very beginning?

357
00:20:09,793 --> 00:20:11,693
-Am I wrong?

358
00:20:11,727 --> 00:20:14,793
The way I see it you were
satisfied with your environment

359
00:20:14,827 --> 00:20:18,793
and did nothing until
it was too late.

360
00:20:18,827 --> 00:20:19,593
-Who are you?

361
00:20:19,627 --> 00:20:22,893
What do you want?

362
00:20:22,927 --> 00:20:24,260
-Just watch me.

363
00:20:24,293 --> 00:20:28,860
I'll gather more fear than you
could ever hope to dream of.

364
00:20:28,893 --> 00:20:29,793
-Gather fear?

365
00:20:34,993 --> 00:20:35,960
-Wait, what do you mean?

366
00:20:41,227 --> 00:20:43,393
-A girl on each arm, eh?

367
00:20:43,427 --> 00:20:47,460
Must be great being
such a bigshot.

368
00:20:47,493 --> 00:20:48,660
[scream]

369
00:20:48,693 --> 00:20:49,593
-Kana!

370
00:20:49,627 --> 00:20:51,927
-You creep.

371
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,893
-You let go of her.

372
00:20:54,927 --> 00:20:59,960
-So, she's your precious
little human, I gather?

373
00:20:59,993 --> 00:21:01,660
-Inugami.

374
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:03,793
That's enough fun
for the time being.

375
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,727
-Are you all right?

376
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:16,727
It's OK.

377
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,827
I'm fine.

378
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,627
What's that?

379
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,960
-Wha-- what's going on?

380
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:29,927
There-- there wasn't
anything like that

381
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,827
when I looked a minute ago.

382
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:37,227
-So you've arrived, my
seven phantom travelers.

383
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:43,627
Or should I say the officers
of the 88 demons of Shikoku?

384
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,093
We can do it.

385
00:21:45,127 --> 00:21:49,660
We're going to take
over this land.

386
00:21:49,693 --> 00:21:54,827
We're the ones who will rise.

387
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,627
NARRATOR: The seven
phantom travelers

388
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,927
have made themselves
known to the Nura clan.

389
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:03,393
What is their leader,
Inugamigyobu Tanuki Tamazuki's,

390
00:22:03,427 --> 00:22:05,227
true goal?

391
00:22:08,302 --> 00:22:11,069
[music playing]

392
00:23:38,965 --> 00:23:40,932
GIRL: Here's a Nura clan quiz.

393
00:23:40,965 --> 00:23:44,599
There are approximately 10,000
Yokai members in the Nura clan.

394
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:46,865
How many groups are
affiliated with the clan?

395
00:23:46,899 --> 00:23:48,532
Find out the answer
in the next episode,

396
00:23:48,565 --> 00:23:52,132
Lord Gyuki's Rebellion--
The Whole Story.
