-In days of old,
people feared Yokai.

The one who stood at the helm
and led the Night Parade of 100

00:00:17,433 --> 00:00:23,300
demons was known as the
Supreme Commander of the Yokai.

They had another name for him.

-I, too, was once human.

00:02:22,496 --> 00:02:26,396
One who fought because
he wanted to live.

10
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:32,663
However, humans do not have the
power to stand up to demons!

[grunt]

00:02:39,396 --> 00:02:41,263
-Tell me, Rikuo.

13
00:02:41,296 --> 00:02:43,896
Will you continue to
reject the way of a Yokai

14
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:48,863
and live your life
completely as a human?

15
00:02:48,896 --> 00:02:51,196
If so, I will risk
my very existence

16
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:53,130
and kill you right now!

17
00:02:53,163 --> 00:02:55,896
But if you intend to become
the third heir, the Supreme

Commander of the Nura
Clan, and live as a Yokai,

then show that
resolve and defeat me.

20
00:03:01,263 --> 00:03:03,396
Give yourself over
to evil, Rikuo.

21
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,230
Abandon your humanity.

22
00:03:05,263 --> 00:03:07,196
As I did!

I am going to become

-Listen carefully.

37
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:39,463
Mount Nejireme is the western
border of the Nura clan.

38
00:04:39,496 --> 00:04:44,163
The clan has no influence with
other Yokai beyond that point.

39
00:04:44,196 --> 00:04:47,130
From here, I can
see it all clearly.

40
00:04:47,163 --> 00:04:51,230
Unless we act now, our
clan will fall apart

from within and without.

42
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:59,530
That is the reason
for all my actions.

43
00:04:59,563 --> 00:05:04,130
I won't tolerate anyone who
dares to try and destroy

44

my beloved Nura clan.

What is the meaning of all this?

56
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:42,863
He dared turn his sword on you.

57
00:05:42,896 --> 00:05:43,696
-Yes.

58
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:46,163
And I do not regret my actions.

The future of the Nura
clan was about to be

62
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,696
entrusted to a fool.

63
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:58,463
A fool who refuses to
accept that he is a Yokai.

64
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,396
But I was wrong.

65
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:07,563
You were able to defeat me.

66
00:06:07,596 --> 00:06:10,563
You have proven to have
the skills and the will.

67
00:06:17,263 --> 00:06:18,630
-Master Rikuo.

68
00:06:18,663 --> 00:06:19,830
Please step back from him.

69
00:06:19,863 --> 00:06:21,130
-He's still dangerous.

70
00:06:21,163 --> 00:06:24,563
-It seems there's no need
for further consideration.

-Master!

-Why did you stop me, Rikuo?

75
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:10,930
Why?

76
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:13,896
I must take
responsibility for this

77
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:16,296
as the one who plotted treason.

78
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:18,396
Why didn't you just let me die?

79
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:22,063
Now I'll never be able
to face Gozu and Mezu.

00:07:22,096 --> 00:07:23,363
-Gyuki.

81
00:07:23,396 --> 00:07:27,663
You've made your reasons
quite painfully clear.

82
00:07:27,696 --> 00:07:30,030
Once you confirmed
I was weak, you

83
00:07:30,063 --> 00:07:32,196
would kill me and then yourself.

84
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:34,230
But I turned out
to be legitimate,

85
00:07:34,263 --> 00:07:36,730
and yet you still chose death.

86
00:07:36,763 --> 00:07:39,563
That is very much like you.

87
00:07:39,596 --> 00:07:42,296
But you know what?

88
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:43,863
There's no need to die.

89
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:45,930
This is nothing.

90
00:07:45,963 --> 00:07:47,730
-What is Master thinking?

91
00:07:47,763 --> 00:07:49,996
-This is a very
serious incident.

92
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:50,596
-Gyuki.

93
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,263

You hear me?

95
00:07:53,496 --> 00:07:55,263
I won't allow a
member of my clan

96
00:07:55,296 --> 00:07:58,530
to die over a small
matter like this one.

-You can get more answers
from my human form.

00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:07,230
If you're not satisfied, then
do whatever you feel is right.

100
00:08:07,263 --> 00:08:08,830
You can kill me for all I care.

GYUKI (VOICEOVER):
I lost my father

102
00:08:14,663 --> 00:08:16,163
when I was five years old.

103
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:19,430
And I was separated from
my mother was I was seven.

104
00:08:19,463 --> 00:08:20,663
I barely remember them.

105
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:29,063
That's all the more reason
why Lord Norarihyon's words

106
00:08:29,096 --> 00:08:32,663
from that day still remain
deep within my heart.

107
00:08:52,563 --> 00:08:53,863
-All right.

108
00:08:53,896 --> 00:08:56,863
Let me be your
father from now on.

You're up.

Well, now.

You're looking much better.

back to your other form

-That's right.

120
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,396
I'm human now.

121
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:31,963
-Do you remember what happens
to you during the night?

122
00:09:31,996 --> 00:09:33,363
-Yes, I remember.

123
00:09:33,396 --> 00:09:37,430
All about Hebidayu and
about the Kyuso clan.

124
00:09:37,463 --> 00:09:43,063
And Mount Nejireme I know
about all the things I did.

125
00:09:43,096 --> 00:09:46,363
When I'm my Yokai form,
my blood seems to boil.

126
00:09:46,396 --> 00:09:47,896
And I lose control of myself.

127
00:09:51,763 --> 00:09:52,463
-Rikuo.

128
00:09:52,496 --> 00:09:54,363
You know you're a--

129
00:09:54,396 --> 00:09:56,230
-I know.

130
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:59,363
I really am a Yokai.

131
00:09:59,396 --> 00:10:02,196
Maybe it's time I
made up my mind.

132
00:10:07,363 --> 00:10:10,163
Honestly, I want
to live in peace.

133
00:10:10,196 --> 00:10:13,096
But there are people
I need to protect.

134
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:16,396
And I know I'm going to have to
rely on this blood to do that.

135
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:27,963
So you see, if there's
someone like you around who I

136
00:10:27,996 --> 00:10:32,396
can trust, someone who
loves this clan so much--

137
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:35,496
I want them to stay and
be a part of the family.

138
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:36,763
-Family.

139
00:10:36,796 --> 00:10:38,030
-Yeah.

140
00:10:38,063 --> 00:10:39,663
Anyway, you just get some rest.

-Hmm.

144
00:10:58,963 --> 00:11:00,696
-Master.

145
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:03,163
How is Lord Gyuki's
condition this morning?

146
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:06,030
-Well, he seems to be
doing a lot better today.

147
00:11:06,063 --> 00:11:07,996
I think that he's
going to be just fine.

148
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:10,096
-Are you sure
about this, Master?

149
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:12,896
Allowing somebody who rebelled
and turned his sword on you

150
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:14,630
to stay in the clan?

151
00:11:14,663 --> 00:11:16,963
-But isn't Gyuki a
member of our family?

152
00:11:16,996 --> 00:11:18,263
-Mmm.

153
00:11:18,296 --> 00:11:19,763
-Oh, by the way.

154
00:11:19,796 --> 00:11:20,896
Kana and the others.

155
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,063
Are they OK?

156
00:11:23,096 --> 00:11:24,063
-Yes.

157
00:11:24,096 --> 00:11:25,063
You don't have to
worry about them.

158
00:11:25,096 --> 00:11:26,163
They're fine.

159
00:11:26,196 --> 00:11:30,263
-We got all of them back
home, safe and sound.

160
00:11:30,296 --> 00:11:31,296
-Grr!

161
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:33,896
Why did you take us to
such an awful place?

162
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:34,830
-Yeah.

163
00:11:34,863 --> 00:11:35,830
When the Yokai
came to attack us,

164
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:37,430
I thought we were all done for.

Honestly, I'm quite
jealous of you all.

168
00:11:42,763 --> 00:11:45,530
I really wish I could have
seen it with my own eyes.

169
00:11:45,563 --> 00:11:46,963
-So what were they like?

170
00:11:46,996 --> 00:11:49,963
-I don't know, and I don't
want to remember, either.

171
00:11:49,996 --> 00:11:51,230
-Yeah, no kidding.

172
00:11:51,263 --> 00:11:53,796
I never want to go through
anything that scary again

173
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:56,063
as long as I live.

174
00:11:56,096 --> 00:11:59,463
I wonder why Nura didn't
show up for school today.

175
00:11:59,496 --> 00:12:02,130
Maybe he's hiding something.

176
00:12:02,163 --> 00:12:02,630
-Huh?

177
00:12:07,963 --> 00:12:09,863
-What do you mean?

178
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,196
-I think this is going to
warrant further investigation.

179
00:12:15,063 --> 00:12:18,163
-It's strange.

180
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:20,463
He wasn't at all scary.

181
00:12:20,496 --> 00:12:23,896
Like that rat Yokai was.

182
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:26,096
-Is something wrong, Ienaga?

183
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:26,830
-Oh.

184
00:12:26,863 --> 00:12:27,996
Um, no.

185
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,230
Nothing at all.

186
00:12:29,263 --> 00:12:30,630
-All right, everyone.

187
00:12:30,663 --> 00:12:33,763
It's time for all of us to go
out again and search for Yokai!

188
00:12:33,796 --> 00:12:34,930
-Yes, sir!

189
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:35,830
-Oh, come on.

190
00:12:35,863 --> 00:12:37,163
You've got to be joking.

191
00:12:37,196 --> 00:12:38,563
-Really?

192
00:12:38,596 --> 00:12:41,296
-I'd be happy to go out
and look for more Yokai.

193
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:42,363
-Huh?

194
00:12:42,396 --> 00:12:44,496
-Wait, Yura, you're
really going to go?

195
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:45,596
-Mmm-hmm.

196
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:48,263
-Now that's what I call
an active onmiyouji!

197
00:12:48,296 --> 00:12:49,230
Let's go!

198
00:12:49,263 --> 00:12:49,730
Shima!

199
00:12:49,763 --> 00:12:50,230
Keikain!

200
00:12:50,263 --> 00:12:51,263
-OK.

201
00:12:51,296 --> 00:12:52,563
-Right.

202
00:12:52,596 --> 00:12:53,096
-Maki!

203
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:53,563
Tori!

204
00:12:53,596 --> 00:12:55,196
Come on!

205
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:55,696
-OK.

206
00:13:01,096 --> 00:13:03,496
-Aww.

207
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:05,963
I guess I'm going to be
bombarded with questions again

208
00:13:05,996 --> 00:13:07,730
at school.

209
00:13:07,763 --> 00:13:09,863
-Rikuo.

210
00:13:09,896 --> 00:13:10,463
-Oh!

211
00:13:10,496 --> 00:13:11,596
Grandpa.

212
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:14,863
-I'd like to have a
few words with you.

213
00:13:14,896 --> 00:13:17,496
-What is it?

214
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,863
-Is your injury healing well?

215
00:13:20,896 --> 00:13:24,763
[gasp]

216
00:13:24,796 --> 00:13:27,763
-Still, that Gyuki has
done the unforgivable.

217
00:13:27,796 --> 00:13:31,096
After everything I've done for
him, how dare he draw his sword

218
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:32,363
and attack you?

219
00:13:32,396 --> 00:13:33,663
-Huh?

220
00:13:33,696 --> 00:13:35,696
-I'll expel him.

221
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:36,963
-No, don't!

222
00:13:36,996 --> 00:13:40,330
-And after I do this, I'll
have him commit hara-kiri.

223
00:13:40,363 --> 00:13:41,230
-No, Grandpa.

224
00:13:41,263 --> 00:13:42,396
Please, wait a minute.

225
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:47,096
Gyuki was only thinking
about the clan.

226
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:48,996
-Well, then, Rikuo.

227
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:52,096
You shall be the one to
pass final judgment on all

228
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:55,363
of Gyuki's actions at the
clan's next General Assembly

229
00:13:55,396 --> 00:13:57,530
as the next Supreme Commander.

230
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:05,863
-I understand, Grandpa.

231
00:14:08,863 --> 00:14:11,230
[theme music]

232
00:14:21,455 --> 00:14:22,121
-All right.

233
00:14:22,155 --> 00:14:24,388
We need to hurry up now.

234
00:14:24,421 --> 00:14:26,655
Everyone is going
to be here soon.

235
00:14:26,688 --> 00:14:27,488
Oh!

236
00:14:27,521 --> 00:14:28,788
[glass breaking]

237
00:14:28,821 --> 00:14:31,255
-Oh, I'm so sorry.

238
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:33,821
-Lady Wakana, we
appreciate your help,

239
00:14:33,855 --> 00:14:35,688
but we can handle the rest.

240
00:14:35,721 --> 00:14:37,555
-No, that's all right.

241
00:14:37,588 --> 00:14:39,555
I really enjoy helping out here.

242
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:40,621
-No, ma'am.

243
00:14:40,655 --> 00:14:41,421
Really.

244
00:14:41,455 --> 00:14:42,588
-This goes over here, right?

245
00:14:42,621 --> 00:14:43,155
Oh!

246
00:14:43,188 --> 00:14:44,688
[glass breaking]

247
00:14:44,721 --> 00:14:46,921
-We don't have much
time, so please

248
00:14:46,955 --> 00:14:48,455
don't give us any
more work to do.

249
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:49,121
[glass breaking]

250
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:50,888
-Whoops!

251
00:14:50,921 --> 00:14:52,821
-I'm really worried.

252
00:14:52,855 --> 00:14:55,721
What do we do if Master totally
bungles up today's General

253
00:14:55,755 --> 00:14:58,021
Assembly?

254
00:14:58,055 --> 00:14:59,521
Hmm?

255
00:14:59,555 --> 00:15:00,055
-Look.

256
00:15:00,088 --> 00:15:01,555
It's Snow Girl.

257
00:15:01,588 --> 00:15:02,788
Hi.

258
00:15:02,821 --> 00:15:04,055
-What?

259
00:15:04,088 --> 00:15:06,155
Gozumaru and Mezumaru?

260
00:15:06,188 --> 00:15:08,055
-You're so useless,
yet they still

261
00:15:08,088 --> 00:15:09,921
keep you around as an attendant?

262
00:15:09,955 --> 00:15:11,488
-What did you say to me?

263
00:15:11,521 --> 00:15:14,221
More importantly, what
are you doing here?

264
00:15:14,255 --> 00:15:15,288
-Haha.

265
00:15:15,321 --> 00:15:16,621
The two of us are going
to be staying here

266
00:15:16,655 --> 00:15:19,088
with the main family
for a little while.

267
00:15:19,121 --> 00:15:21,755
-Ah!

268
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:23,788
-That's the way it
is for now, anyway.

269
00:15:23,821 --> 00:15:26,455
So see you around, Snow Girl.

270
00:15:26,488 --> 00:15:26,955
-Yeah.

271
00:15:26,988 --> 00:15:27,455
See you.

272
00:15:32,521 --> 00:15:34,221
-No way.

273
00:15:34,255 --> 00:15:36,021
This can't be happening.

274
00:15:36,055 --> 00:15:37,588
I won't accept it.

275
00:15:37,621 --> 00:15:38,088
Master!

276
00:15:54,555 --> 00:15:58,088
-The General Assembly of the
Nura clan is now in session.

277
00:16:00,855 --> 00:16:01,655
-Oh.

278
00:16:01,688 --> 00:16:03,821
Master Rikuo is in attendance.

279
00:16:03,855 --> 00:16:04,621
-Yes.

280
00:16:04,655 --> 00:16:06,788
It's been such a long time.

281
00:16:06,821 --> 00:16:08,288
-Gyuki is here, too.

282
00:16:08,321 --> 00:16:12,188
According to rumors, he turned
his sword on Master Rikuo.

283
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,921
-Then why has he come
to the General Assembly?

284
00:16:14,955 --> 00:16:18,055
-There's probably going to
be some kind of judgment.

285
00:16:18,088 --> 00:16:21,088
Let's just watch and
see what happens.

286
00:16:21,121 --> 00:16:22,388
-This is impressive.

287
00:16:22,421 --> 00:16:24,721
All of the big shots are here.

288
00:16:24,755 --> 00:16:28,121
-Do you think Master
is going to be OK?

289
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:30,621
-What are you two doing there?

290
00:16:30,655 --> 00:16:31,488
-Oh!

291
00:16:31,521 --> 00:16:32,721
Lady Wakana.

292
00:16:32,755 --> 00:16:35,821
-Well, it's a very important
day for Master Rikuo,

293
00:16:35,855 --> 00:16:37,521
so we were just, um--

294
00:16:37,555 --> 00:16:39,988
-At this assembly,
it will be decided

295
00:16:40,021 --> 00:16:43,421
whether Master becomes
the third heir or not.

296
00:16:43,455 --> 00:16:44,588
-Well, then!

297
00:16:44,621 --> 00:16:47,255
I'm very glad that I
made red-bean rice today.

298
00:16:47,288 --> 00:16:49,955
It's the perfect dish
for big celebrations.

299
00:16:49,988 --> 00:16:51,255
-Huh.

300
00:16:51,288 --> 00:16:52,688
-Celebration, huh?

301
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:56,221
-As usual, Lady Wakana is
so cheerful and optimistic

302
00:16:56,255 --> 00:16:57,921
about everything.

303
00:16:57,955 --> 00:16:58,921
-Yeah.

304
00:16:58,955 --> 00:17:00,855
Nothing ever seems
to bring her down.

305
00:17:00,888 --> 00:17:04,021
-She has faith in our master.

306
00:17:04,055 --> 00:17:07,888
He is, after all, her son.

307
00:17:07,921 --> 00:17:10,055
-Master Rikuo, why
can't you attend

308
00:17:10,088 --> 00:17:13,121
this most important
meeting in your Yokai form?

309
00:17:13,155 --> 00:17:15,088
-It's not like I can
switch back and forth

310
00:17:15,121 --> 00:17:17,155
at the snap of my
fingers, you know?

311
00:17:17,188 --> 00:17:19,788
-But Master, they just
won't take you seriously

312
00:17:19,821 --> 00:17:21,355
if you walk in
looking like that.

313
00:17:21,388 --> 00:17:23,555
-But there's nothing
I can do about it.

314
00:17:23,588 --> 00:17:26,121
-What is the purpose of
this General Assembly?

315
00:17:29,055 --> 00:17:32,188
If this meeting of the clan
is what I think it's for,

316
00:17:32,221 --> 00:17:33,988
then this is hardly
the time for us

317
00:17:34,021 --> 00:17:35,988
to be celebrating
with such a feast.

318
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:38,755
-What do you mean, Hitotsume?

319
00:17:38,788 --> 00:17:41,988
-I say this for the
sake of the Nura clan.

320
00:17:42,021 --> 00:17:44,421
It's time that we
settled things.

321
00:17:44,455 --> 00:17:46,721
Once and for all.

322
00:17:46,755 --> 00:17:47,888
-I fully agree.

323
00:17:47,921 --> 00:17:50,921
So shall we begin?

324
00:17:50,955 --> 00:17:54,321
I summoned you all here
today for one single purpose.

325
00:17:54,355 --> 00:17:56,655
To strengthen the Nura clan.

326
00:17:56,688 --> 00:17:58,988
To achieve this, I
plan to officially name

327
00:17:59,021 --> 00:18:03,055
Rikuo Nura as the third heir
and next Supreme Commander.

328
00:18:03,088 --> 00:18:05,555
-This is rather sudden,
don't you think?

329
00:18:05,588 --> 00:18:06,788
-On the contrary.

330
00:18:06,821 --> 00:18:09,688
I've been far too
idle until now.

331
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:13,655
The time has come for you
to take charge, Rikuo.

332
00:18:13,688 --> 00:18:16,355
-But, Supreme Commander.

333
00:18:16,388 --> 00:18:19,555
Before that, we must settle
this unfortunate issue

334
00:18:19,588 --> 00:18:21,955
regarding Gyuki and his clan.

335
00:18:21,988 --> 00:18:23,155
-Yes.

336
00:18:23,188 --> 00:18:25,321
And it is my intention to
leave the final decision

337
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:27,688
on that to Rikuo.

338
00:18:27,721 --> 00:18:30,655
-Isn't it a little too late to
place such high hopes on Master

339
00:18:30,688 --> 00:18:31,788
Rikuo?

340
00:18:31,821 --> 00:18:33,588
-Stand firm, Master Rikuo.

341
00:18:33,621 --> 00:18:34,521
-Don't push me.

342
00:18:34,555 --> 00:18:36,788
-I'm not!

343
00:18:36,821 --> 00:18:38,721
-All right, Rikuo.

344
00:18:38,755 --> 00:18:41,955
Tell us what your verdict is.

345
00:18:41,988 --> 00:18:42,455
-OK.

346
00:18:53,155 --> 00:18:56,055
On this most auspicious
day of the lunar calendar,

347
00:18:56,088 --> 00:18:59,488
it is my pleasure to welcome
you to the Nura clan's General

348
00:18:59,521 --> 00:19:00,021
Assembly.

349
00:19:02,721 --> 00:19:08,221
I beg your pardon for addressing
you from this raised position.

350
00:19:08,255 --> 00:19:10,855
I will accept the
responsibilities

351
00:19:10,888 --> 00:19:13,188
as the third heir
of the Nura clan

352
00:19:13,221 --> 00:19:16,688
and swear to live up
to its proud name.

353
00:19:16,721 --> 00:19:20,388
However, I am a novice,
still in training

354
00:19:20,421 --> 00:19:23,588
in the valiant
ways of the Yokai.

355
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:28,288
So if I misspeak, or am somehow
discourteous in my dealings,

356
00:19:28,321 --> 00:19:31,288
I humbly ask for
your forgiveness.

357
00:19:31,321 --> 00:19:32,921
Now, then.

358
00:19:32,955 --> 00:19:35,988
Please allow me to explain
Gyuki's insurrection,

359
00:19:36,021 --> 00:19:39,555
as it explains my decision.

360
00:19:39,588 --> 00:19:42,888
As you may have
heard by now, Gyuki

361
00:19:42,921 --> 00:19:46,021
did indeed cross swords with me.

362
00:19:46,055 --> 00:19:48,355
Furthermore, it is
also true that he

363
00:19:48,388 --> 00:19:51,655
used Kyuso, who had been
previously expelled,

364
00:19:51,688 --> 00:19:53,755
and tried to
circulate a petition

365
00:19:53,788 --> 00:19:56,055
to force my retirement.

366
00:19:56,088 --> 00:19:58,355
-So it's true after all.

367
00:19:58,388 --> 00:20:00,355
-What a fool.

368
00:20:00,388 --> 00:20:03,921
Gyuki you won't get
off easily from this.

369
00:20:03,955 --> 00:20:08,188
-However, it's indisputable that
he acted out of total devotion

370
00:20:08,221 --> 00:20:09,855
to the Nura clan.

371
00:20:09,888 --> 00:20:15,455
His actions resulted from
my apparent incompetence.

372
00:20:15,488 --> 00:20:17,921
Thus, with regard
to this incident,

373
00:20:17,955 --> 00:20:20,021
I judge Gyuki not guilty.

374
00:20:20,055 --> 00:20:22,788
There is no sentence, and
I take full responsibility

375
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:24,421
for what happened.

376
00:20:24,455 --> 00:20:25,488
-Ridiculous!

377
00:20:25,521 --> 00:20:27,521
How could you say
something like that?

378
00:20:27,555 --> 00:20:28,821
-It's my decision.

379
00:20:28,855 --> 00:20:30,655
Do you question it?

380
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:31,355
-Yes.

381
00:20:31,388 --> 00:20:32,821
Of course I do!

382
00:20:32,855 --> 00:20:34,888
It's simple common
sense to punish

383
00:20:34,921 --> 00:20:37,488
someone who commits treason.

384
00:20:37,521 --> 00:20:41,588
-What Gyuki did was not treason.

385
00:20:41,621 --> 00:20:44,588
-And what are you
basing that opinion on?

386
00:20:44,621 --> 00:20:46,721
-As you are well
aware, the Nura clan

387
00:20:46,755 --> 00:20:50,088
does not have any territory
west of Mount Nejireme which

388
00:20:50,121 --> 00:20:51,621
Gyuki protects.

389
00:20:51,655 --> 00:20:53,821
That mountain is
our clan's border.

390
00:20:53,855 --> 00:20:56,521
It must be protected
at all costs.

391
00:20:56,555 --> 00:21:01,555
In my mind, there is no one
but Gyuki who can do so.

392
00:21:01,588 --> 00:21:04,588
Isn't that right, Gyuki?

393
00:21:04,621 --> 00:21:08,921
-I would give my
life to protect it.

394
00:21:08,955 --> 00:21:15,088
-That is why the Gyuki clan will
remain a part of our family.

395
00:21:15,121 --> 00:21:15,588
OK.

396
00:21:15,621 --> 00:21:16,988
I'm done.

397
00:21:17,021 --> 00:21:20,588
Sorry to take up so much time.

398
00:21:20,621 --> 00:21:22,188
-Grr.

399
00:21:22,221 --> 00:21:22,688
-Hmm.

400
00:21:31,021 --> 00:21:32,988
-Hmm.

401
00:21:33,021 --> 00:21:33,921
-Now, then.

402
00:21:33,955 --> 00:21:37,221
We hereby decree
Master Rikuo to be

403
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:40,221
an official candidate
for the third heir.

404
00:21:40,255 --> 00:21:42,855
And if no other
candidate appears

405
00:21:42,888 --> 00:21:47,188
before his 13th birthday, the
coming of age for a Yokai,

406
00:21:47,221 --> 00:21:50,055
Master Rikuo will
officially take over

407
00:21:50,088 --> 00:21:53,355
and become the third Supreme
Commander of the Nura clan.

408
00:21:56,021 --> 00:21:59,988
-Though a cloud of distrust
still hangs over the Nura clan,

409
00:22:00,021 --> 00:22:02,255
Rikuo has embraced his destiny.

410
00:22:02,288 --> 00:22:05,888
But is he truly ready
to lead the clan?

411
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:11,492
[theme music - in japanese]

412
00:23:38,345 --> 00:23:41,445
-Would it be great if there
was a fashion Yokai who

413
00:23:41,478 --> 00:23:42,778
could make anybody look cute?

414
00:23:42,812 --> 00:23:43,678
-That sounds stupid.

415
00:23:43,712 --> 00:23:44,412
Right, Kiyotsugu?

416
00:23:44,445 --> 00:23:44,978
-No.

417
00:23:45,012 --> 00:23:45,678
It's brilliant.

418
00:23:45,712 --> 00:23:46,945
I'd love to meet one.

419
00:23:46,978 --> 00:23:48,612
-Are you serious?

420
00:23:48,645 --> 00:23:50,545
-Next time.
