00:00:09,311 --> 00:00:13,444
NARRATOR: In days of
old, people feared Yokai.

2
00:00:13,478 --> 00:00:16,411
The one who stood at the
helm, and led the night

3
00:00:16,444 --> 00:00:19,111
parade of a hundred
demons was known

4
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:23,244
as the Supreme
Commander of the Yokai.

5
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:26,244
They had another name
for him, the Lord

6
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:28,878
of Pandemonium-- Nurarihyon.

[theme music]

8
00:02:04,412 --> 00:02:07,912
-Tamazuki is like I
was when I was young,

9
00:02:07,946 --> 00:02:11,812
trying everything he can to gain
power, and rule through fear.

10
00:02:11,846 --> 00:02:15,546
He now leads a group of Yokai
known as the Seven Phantom

11
00:02:15,579 --> 00:02:16,612
Travelers.

12
00:02:16,646 --> 00:02:18,746
-Seven Phantom Travelers, eh?

13
00:02:18,779 --> 00:02:20,879
-Among them is one
known as Inugami.

14
00:02:20,912 --> 00:02:24,746
He is an especially violent
and dangerous Yokai.

15
00:02:24,779 --> 00:02:26,079
-Inugami.

16
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:28,546
-Hate and malice
feeds his power.

17
00:02:28,579 --> 00:02:30,946
Of all of them, he
is one to be feared.

18
00:02:34,346 --> 00:02:36,279
NARRATOR: A dark force
threatens the lives

19
00:02:36,312 --> 00:02:38,412
of Rikuo and his friends.

20
00:02:38,446 --> 00:02:43,346
His name-- Inugamigyoubu
Tanuki Tamazuki.

21
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:45,946
He and the Seven Phantom
Travelers of Shikoku

22
00:02:45,979 --> 00:02:49,312
have declared war against
the Nura Clan in an attempt

23
00:02:49,346 --> 00:02:52,179
to take over their
territory before conquering

24
00:02:52,212 --> 00:02:54,846
the whole country.

25
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:55,479
-That's enough.

26
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:03,012
-Long ago, I wanted to
fit in with human society,

27
00:03:03,046 --> 00:03:05,779
so I tried desperately
to act like one of them.

28
00:03:10,179 --> 00:03:11,512
WOMAN: What's with this guy?

29
00:03:11,546 --> 00:03:12,479
He's scary.

30
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,046
GIRL: Eww.

31
00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:14,612
What a creep.

32
00:03:14,646 --> 00:03:16,312
MAN: Man, he's annoying.

33
00:03:16,346 --> 00:03:18,312
-But they wouldn't accept me.

34
00:03:18,346 --> 00:03:21,579
I spent my entire life being
ostracized, all because I

35
00:03:21,612 --> 00:03:26,379
was born a Yokai
and not a human.

36
00:03:26,412 --> 00:03:29,679
Back then, I wasn't even aware
that a world for Yokai existed.

37
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:34,412
I had no friends.

38
00:03:34,446 --> 00:03:39,612
I was alone with nowhere
to go until that day.

TSURARA (VOICEOVER): The
Curtain Falls in the Darkness.

00:03:56,779 --> 00:03:58,046
-I hate you.

41
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:00,779
I hate you, Rikuo Nura!

42
00:04:00,812 --> 00:04:02,246
I want to kill you now!

43
00:04:22,312 --> 00:04:23,279
-Look.

44
00:04:23,312 --> 00:04:24,746
His head.

45
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:25,246
-Die!

46
00:04:33,679 --> 00:04:35,612
-They're coming after us!

47
00:04:35,646 --> 00:04:37,579
-What do we do?

48
00:04:37,612 --> 00:04:40,046
-Don't worry.

49
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:42,046
-Be careful.

50
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:45,512
-I'll clear them
out in one sweep.

Yura Max!

56
00:05:14,146 --> 00:05:17,246
There are too many of them.

57
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:19,279
-I got the light bulb replaced.

58
00:05:19,312 --> 00:05:19,979
-Yeah.

59
00:05:20,012 --> 00:05:21,712
It seems to be working.

60
00:05:21,746 --> 00:05:22,879
-What now?

61
00:05:22,912 --> 00:05:23,579
-Right.

62
00:05:23,612 --> 00:05:24,679
Back to the auditorium.

63
00:05:24,712 --> 00:05:25,679
-Huh?

64
00:05:25,712 --> 00:05:27,412
-The Yokai should
be appearing soon.

65
00:05:27,446 --> 00:05:30,746
-But Kiyotsugu, what if Yokai
really do appear out there?

66
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:31,712
-Don't worry, Shima.

67
00:05:31,746 --> 00:05:33,679
I've got everything
under control.

68
00:05:33,712 --> 00:05:36,946
Remember I have this-- the Seven
Branched Sword of Exorcism!

69
00:05:41,446 --> 00:05:42,746
-Oh no.

70
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:43,679
-It's out again!

71
00:05:52,746 --> 00:05:54,879
-Master Rikuo,
are you all right?

72
00:05:54,912 --> 00:05:55,412
-Yeah.

73
00:05:55,446 --> 00:05:56,779
Thanks.

74
00:05:56,812 --> 00:05:58,146
-How dare you interfere!

75
00:06:01,046 --> 00:06:03,279
I won't miss this time!

76
00:06:03,312 --> 00:06:03,957
-Master!

77
00:06:07,212 --> 00:06:08,146
-Master!

78
00:06:08,179 --> 00:06:11,546
-Yuki Onna, no!

79
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:12,046
-Die!

80
00:06:17,446 --> 00:06:20,479
What is this?

81
00:06:20,512 --> 00:06:21,412
-That was close.

82
00:06:25,679 --> 00:06:27,946
-You think you're so
damn smart, don't you?

83
00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:29,812
But a string like
this is nothing.

84
00:06:29,846 --> 00:06:31,712
-It's useless.

85
00:06:31,746 --> 00:06:33,779
The more you struggle
to escape, the tighter

86
00:06:33,812 --> 00:06:35,579
this string winds around you.

87
00:06:35,612 --> 00:06:41,046
-Kubinashi's string,
isn't just for

88
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:43,846
-Bastard!

89
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:44,512
Damn it!

90
00:06:44,546 --> 00:06:46,446
I can't move.

91
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,979
Damn it!

92
00:06:49,012 --> 00:06:51,512
-On that day, I learned
for the first time

93
00:06:51,546 --> 00:06:57,279
that Yokai had their own
society, just like humans.

94
00:06:57,312 --> 00:07:00,612
-I want you to join,
and be part of my group.

95
00:07:00,646 --> 00:07:04,179
After all, you're
a Yokai too, right?

96
00:07:04,212 --> 00:07:06,812
-Join you?

97
00:07:06,846 --> 00:07:14,346
If you want me to join
you, why would you do this?

98
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:18,246
Why?

99
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:20,246
Why do you have to put
me through all this crap?

100
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:24,879
-It's quite simple.

101
00:07:24,912 --> 00:07:27,912
I want to see how strong you.

102
00:07:27,946 --> 00:07:29,579
-How strong?

103
00:07:29,612 --> 00:07:32,812
I'm not strong at all.

104
00:07:32,846 --> 00:07:37,446
-Then do you want to die?

105
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:40,846
A weak Yokai simply
doesn't deserve to live,

106
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:43,646
because he'll only end up
being shunned and despised

107
00:07:43,679 --> 00:07:46,446
instead of feared by humans.

108
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,212
Or do you want to go
back to your old life?

109
00:07:52,312 --> 00:07:52,779
-No.

110
00:07:52,812 --> 00:07:55,046
I don't.

111
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:56,279
And I don't want to die!

112
00:08:02,512 --> 00:08:03,979
Damn it.

113
00:08:04,012 --> 00:08:06,012
They're all the same.

114
00:08:06,046 --> 00:08:07,446
I didn't ask to be this way!

115

[screaming]

116
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:38,212
-That was incredible.

117
00:08:38,246 --> 00:08:40,912
The more your hatred
for humans builds,

118
00:08:40,946 --> 00:08:42,546
the greater your power becomes.

119
00:08:55,512 --> 00:08:56,846
-Come with me.

120
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:57,979
Let me show you.

121
00:09:00,912 --> 00:09:05,412
Come and see the new
world of the Yokai.

122
00:09:05,446 --> 00:09:10,079
-Tamazuki turned me, someone
who is neither human nor Yokai,

123
00:09:10,112 --> 00:09:13,046
into a true Yokai with power!

124
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:16,279
-Tamazuki, leader of
the Shikoku Yokai.

125
00:09:16,312 --> 00:09:20,846
-Tamazuki is the one who
inspires true fear, the one who

126
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:23,046
should rule over the Yokai.

127
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:25,479
Compared to him, you're nothing.

128
00:09:25,512 --> 00:09:29,879
You waste your efforts trying
to blend in with the humans.

129
00:09:29,912 --> 00:09:32,546
Even when he was among
the human society,

130
00:09:32,579 --> 00:09:35,479
Tamazuki stood out as a leader.

131
00:09:35,512 --> 00:09:39,512
He drew them in with
his power and charisma.

132
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:41,946
Unlike you who has his
guards to protect him,

133
00:09:41,979 --> 00:09:45,379
and who chooses to play around
with his little human friends.

134
00:09:45,412 --> 00:09:46,212
-Don't move.

135
00:09:49,079 --> 00:09:50,346
-Inugami, listen to me.

136
00:09:50,379 --> 00:09:52,812
You've been taken
in by Tamazuki.

137
00:09:52,846 --> 00:09:53,446
-Ha.

138
00:09:53,479 --> 00:09:55,879
Taken in?

139
00:09:55,912 --> 00:09:58,346
Tamazuki is the sly
tanuki who doesn't

140
00:09:58,379 --> 00:10:00,579
hesitate to put on
sheep's clothing.

141
00:10:00,612 --> 00:10:04,412
I've known that from
the very beginning.

142
00:10:04,446 --> 00:10:07,112
Still, Tamazuki is
the one who taught me

143
00:10:07,146 --> 00:10:12,046
that Yokai stand above humans,
that I have power inside of me,

144
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,646
that there is a place for me.

145
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:17,646
He taught me all that.

146
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:20,446
-Then he taught you
something very wrong.

147
00:10:20,479 --> 00:10:23,479
Yokai are no better or
worse than humans are.

148
00:10:23,512 --> 00:10:24,046
-No!

149
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:24,979
He's not wrong!

150
00:10:34,412 --> 00:10:34,946
-What?

151
00:10:34,979 --> 00:10:36,346
What is that?

152
00:10:36,379 --> 00:10:37,512
-Huh?

153
00:10:37,546 --> 00:10:38,879
What's going on here?

154
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:48,979
-Hatred and anger have finally
awakened Inugami's true power,

155
00:10:49,012 --> 00:10:52,579
making him unstoppable now.

156
00:10:52,612 --> 00:10:54,546
[chuckling]

157
00:10:58,046 --> 00:10:59,512
-He acknowledged me.

158
00:10:59,546 --> 00:11:01,979
Tamazuki is the only
one in this entire world

159
00:11:02,012 --> 00:11:04,146
who accepted me for what I am!

160
00:11:04,179 --> 00:11:05,612
He's not wrong!

161
00:11:15,379 --> 00:11:16,346
-No.

162
00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:17,312
This is bad.

163
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:23,079
-I will not acknowledge you.

164
00:11:23,112 --> 00:11:25,779
I'll never acknowledge
the existence of a Yokai

165

who is liked by everyone.

00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:29,912
-It's useless.

167
00:11:29,946 --> 00:11:31,912
My strings cannot be
broken that easily.

168
00:12:04,112 --> 00:12:06,879
-Master, please step back.

169
00:12:06,912 --> 00:12:09,512
-I am Tamazuki's loyal servant.

170
00:12:09,546 --> 00:12:12,712
I am the Yokai, Inugami!

172
00:12:33,999 --> 00:12:35,066
-Aw.

173
00:12:35,099 --> 00:12:38,466
It doesn't seem to be
working at all now.

174
00:12:38,499 --> 00:12:38,966
Huh?

175
00:12:41,966 --> 00:12:42,999
Hear that?

176
00:12:43,032 --> 00:12:45,832
-What was it?

177
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:48,366
-It seems to be coming
from the auditorium.

178
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,266
Shima, go check it out, and
find out what's going on.

179
00:12:51,299 --> 00:12:52,399
-Huh?

180
00:12:52,432 --> 00:12:54,566
-I'm busy here trying to
get this darn projector

181
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:55,999
to work properly.

182
00:12:56,032 --> 00:12:59,132
Who else is there to do it?

183
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:00,032
-All right.

184
00:13:00,066 --> 00:13:03,099
I'll go check it out.

00:13:03,966 --> 00:13:04,966
He's such a slave driver.

187
00:13:09,232 --> 00:13:10,932
Was the screen always
torn like that?

It is real!

191
00:13:28,632 --> 00:13:29,899
Kiyotsugu, it's here.

192
00:13:29,932 --> 00:13:30,566
It's here.

193
00:13:30,599 --> 00:13:32,699
It's a Yokai!

194
00:13:32,732 --> 00:13:33,632
-What?

195
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:35,699
A Yokai's really
appeared in there?

196
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:36,732
-Help.

197
00:13:36,766 --> 00:13:39,899
There's a huge Yokai
in the auditorium.

198
00:13:39,932 --> 00:13:40,566
-All right.

199
00:13:40,599 --> 00:13:41,399
I'll be right there!

200
00:13:58,866 --> 00:14:00,832
-Master, are you OK?

201
00:14:00,866 --> 00:14:01,466
-Yeah.

202
00:14:01,499 --> 00:14:01,966
Thanks a lot.

203
00:14:01,999 --> 00:14:02,799
I'm fine.

204
00:14:02,832 --> 00:14:05,499
-Master Rikuo, please get back.

205
00:14:05,532 --> 00:14:07,799
-Kubinashi, what's
happening to him?

206
00:14:11,599 --> 00:14:12,966
-I don't believe it.

207
00:14:12,999 --> 00:14:13,866
He's become huge.

208
00:14:22,966 --> 00:14:24,732
-His head has re-attached.

209
00:14:24,766 --> 00:14:26,199
-What the hell?

210
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:27,199
What is he?

211
00:14:35,566 --> 00:14:37,499
KIYOTSUGU: Shima, what's
going on out there?

212
00:14:37,532 --> 00:14:38,966
The door won't open, Shima.

213
00:14:38,999 --> 00:14:41,399
You there?

214
00:14:41,432 --> 00:14:44,299
-The door's blocked by
some concrete rubble.

215
00:14:44,332 --> 00:14:45,899
I'll be right there.

216

-This is bad.

00:14:57,566 --> 00:14:59,732
-Protect Master Rikuo.

221
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:00,466
-Right.

222
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:02,066
-Leave it to us.

223
00:15:02,099 --> 00:15:03,366
-I'll protect you.

-The weak must die.

225
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,266
That is the code of
the Shikoku Yokai.

-Master, please.

227
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,399
You've gotta get out of here..

228
00:15:17,432 --> 00:15:18,399
-Let us handle this guy.

00:15:47,366 --> 00:15:49,166
-No one will save you now.

00:15:53,499 --> 00:15:55,032
-Master, run away.

235
00:16:16,766 --> 00:16:18,632
-Now, time for you to die.

236
00:16:30,999 --> 00:16:31,466
-No!

237
00:16:41,499 --> 00:16:45,466
[laughter]

238
00:16:45,499 --> 00:16:48,999
-I've killed Rikuo Nura!

Huh?

240
00:16:52,932 --> 00:16:53,866
What is this?

241
00:17:03,966 --> 00:17:16,732
-The darkness signals
the curtain to fall.

242
00:17:21,866 --> 00:17:26,632
Time to get you off
this stage, dog breath.

243
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:28,599
-Master is OK.

244
00:17:28,632 --> 00:17:29,532
He's alive.

245
00:17:29,566 --> 00:17:30,132
Oh.

246
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:32,066
Thank goodness.

247
00:17:32,099 --> 00:17:35,166
-Are you Rikuo Nura?

248
00:17:35,199 --> 00:17:36,766
-You've been putting
on quite a show,

249
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,499
getting real carried
away with yourself.

250
00:17:42,632 --> 00:17:44,999
-I don't care who
the hell you are.

251
00:17:45,032 --> 00:17:45,899
I'll kill you!

252
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:58,266
-I think you've got the wrong
idea that having a big body

253
00:17:58,299 --> 00:17:59,199
makes you strong.

254
00:18:02,032 --> 00:18:03,899
-Don't mess with me.

255
00:18:03,932 --> 00:18:06,966
How can someone like
you have so much power.

256
00:18:06,999 --> 00:18:08,599
I can't accept that.

257
00:18:08,632 --> 00:18:10,399
I refuse to accept it!

258
00:18:18,199 --> 00:18:22,066
-Shima, are you all right?

259
00:18:22,099 --> 00:18:23,532
Hey, Shima.

260
00:18:23,566 --> 00:18:27,166
-Kiyotsugu, there's a
Yokai in the auditorium.

-Leave it to me with my Seven
Branch Sword of Exorcism!

262
00:18:36,499 --> 00:18:39,199
As the proud captain of the
Kiyojuji Paranormal Patrol,

263
00:18:39,232 --> 00:18:42,032
I shall go forth and
exterminate the Yokai!

264
00:18:42,066 --> 00:18:42,532
Haa!

265
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:47,866
Huh?

266
00:18:47,899 --> 00:18:49,332
Where's my Yokai!?

267
00:18:55,699 --> 00:18:56,399
-Are we safe?

268
00:18:56,432 --> 00:18:57,232
-No.

269
00:18:57,266 --> 00:18:58,399
Let's get out of here right now.

270
00:18:58,432 --> 00:18:58,899
-Right.

271
00:19:05,532 --> 00:19:05,999
-Wait.

272
00:19:06,032 --> 00:19:06,499
That's--

273
00:19:23,999 --> 00:19:27,066
-Why don't you quit
running around already?

274
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:28,032
-Shut up!

275
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:42,899
-Hey.

276
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:44,666
Not bad.

277
00:19:44,699 --> 00:19:48,266
-You're nothing but
a low level Yokai.

278
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:51,099
Die!

279
00:19:51,132 --> 00:19:52,599
-I'm really getting
tired of hearing

280
00:19:52,632 --> 00:19:54,599
you whine about who's better.

281
00:19:54,632 --> 00:19:55,432
-Huh?

282
00:19:55,466 --> 00:19:57,699
-So I have some news for you.

283

You're not the only
one who's in imperfect!

-What?

285
00:20:16,199 --> 00:20:17,299
-Damn it.

286
00:20:17,332 --> 00:20:19,732
I won't lose to you.

287
00:20:40,299 --> 00:20:43,732
-Are you all right, Inugami?

288
00:20:43,766 --> 00:20:47,932
-Tamazuki, I haven't
lost this fight yet.

289
00:20:47,966 --> 00:20:50,566
-You're a valuable
comrade, Inugami.

290
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:54,666
I have no plans of
letting you die just yet.

291
00:20:54,699 --> 00:20:55,932
-Enough with this charade.

292
00:21:00,066 --> 00:21:03,832
-Is that really you, Rikuo Nura?

293
00:21:03,866 --> 00:21:08,666
I wasn't expecting such an
impressive transformation.

294
00:21:08,699 --> 00:21:09,899
Well, well.

295
00:21:09,932 --> 00:21:13,566
It appears I underestimated
you and your abilities.

296
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:17,299
-What are you really
after, Tamazuki?

297
00:21:17,332 --> 00:21:19,632
-Didn't I tell you already?

298
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:22,632
I intend to steal
away your fear,

299
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:26,299
and use it to stand
above all Yokai.

300
00:21:26,332 --> 00:21:27,432
-Funny.

301
00:21:27,466 --> 00:21:30,599
I was thinking the same
thing, little tanuki.

302

-Well then, I think the time
has come to call it a night.

303
00:21:36,632 --> 00:21:41,166
However, I promise the
next time you and I meet,

304
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:41,999
I'll take your life.

-Inugamigyoubu Tanuki
Tamazuki, he certainly

My beloved Nura Clan?

it at his own expense.
