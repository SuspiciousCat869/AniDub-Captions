1
00:00:09,893 --> 00:00:14,026
-In days of old,
people feared Yokai.

2
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:17,860
The one who stood at the helm
and led the Night Parade of 100

3
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:23,360
demons was known as the
Supreme Commander of the Yokai.

4
00:00:23,393 --> 00:00:26,493
They had another name for him.

5
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:29,126
The Lord of Pandemonium.

6
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,660
Nurarihyon.

7
00:00:31,693 --> 00:00:33,393
[theme music - in japanese]

8
00:02:04,301 --> 00:02:06,367
-Supreme Commander!

9
00:02:06,401 --> 00:02:09,667
Supreme Commander
please, answer me!

10
00:02:09,701 --> 00:02:11,267
Where are you?

11
00:02:11,301 --> 00:02:13,367
Where have you gone,
Supreme Commander?

12
00:02:13,401 --> 00:02:15,567
Supreme Commander!

13
00:02:15,601 --> 00:02:17,667
Supreme Commander!

14
00:02:17,701 --> 00:02:18,867
-Oh, boy.

15
00:02:18,901 --> 00:02:20,601
I hope this doesn't turn
into something really bad.

16
00:02:20,634 --> 00:02:21,101
-Yeah.

17
00:02:21,134 --> 00:02:23,901
Me too.

18
00:02:23,934 --> 00:02:24,899
-Thank you for the food.

19
00:02:24,933 --> 00:02:25,733
Huh?

20
00:02:25,766 --> 00:02:27,899
-Huh?

21
00:02:27,933 --> 00:02:30,166
[crying]

22
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,499
-He's not here either.

23
00:02:31,533 --> 00:02:34,099
The Supreme Commander is gone.

24
00:02:34,133 --> 00:02:35,166
[sigh]

25
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:37,033
-He wouldn't be in
there, of all places.

26
00:02:37,066 --> 00:02:38,299
-He's right.

27
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:40,933
You'll never find him in there.

28
00:02:40,966 --> 00:02:42,266
-Oh, Supreme Commander.

29
00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:43,766
Where have you gone off to?

30
00:02:43,799 --> 00:02:45,566
I'm so worried about you!

31
00:02:49,066 --> 00:02:51,533
-Now, calm down, Karasu Tengu.

32
00:02:51,566 --> 00:02:52,133
-Yes.

33
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:53,099
Don't worry.

34
00:02:53,133 --> 00:02:54,666
Father always
disappears suddenly,

35
00:02:54,699 --> 00:02:57,333
often for days at a time,
then shows up again.

36
00:02:57,366 --> 00:02:59,333
-I know, but how
could he do this now?

37
00:02:59,366 --> 00:03:01,599
Where could he possibly
go at a time like this?

38
00:03:01,633 --> 00:03:03,833
Supreme Commander, come
out wherever you are.

39
00:03:03,866 --> 00:03:06,533
Come out, please!

40
00:03:06,566 --> 00:03:10,366
[sigh]

41
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:12,699
-Watch me.

42
00:03:12,733 --> 00:03:17,466
I'll gather more fear than you
could ever hope to dream of.

43
00:03:17,499 --> 00:03:19,666
[grunt]

44
00:03:28,633 --> 00:03:30,833
-We finally arrived
at the place where

45
00:03:30,866 --> 00:03:34,499
all our dreams can be fulfilled.

46
00:03:34,533 --> 00:03:35,966
-Tell me.

47
00:03:35,999 --> 00:03:38,266
Is it true that
Nurarihyon has gone

48
00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:40,599
missing after battling Muchi?

49
00:03:40,633 --> 00:03:41,733
-Yes.

50
00:03:41,766 --> 00:03:43,699
We will take
advantage of the chaos

51
00:03:43,733 --> 00:03:46,633
to destroy the Nura
clan in one blow.

52
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:48,033
[laughter]

53
00:03:48,066 --> 00:03:51,133
-Still, the Nura clan
has within its ranks

54
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:54,099
many strong and
distinguished warriors.

55
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:56,099
Surely it won't be that easy.

56
00:03:56,133 --> 00:03:57,099
-Ha.

57
00:03:57,133 --> 00:03:58,233
They're nothing.

58
00:03:58,266 --> 00:04:01,266
-Another thing to consider
is that Tochigami,

59
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:04,299
the deities of this region,
are the ones who actually

60
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:06,866
gather the people's
faith and fear.

61
00:04:06,899 --> 00:04:09,633
The humans have developed
a deep bond with them

62
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,066
over a long period of time.

63
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:14,066
Because of that,
these deities can

64
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:17,199
be considered a valuable
asset to the Nura clan.

65
00:04:17,233 --> 00:04:19,266
-Then the first thing
we do is wipe out

66
00:04:19,299 --> 00:04:21,333
each and every one of them.

67
00:04:21,366 --> 00:04:24,566
And then watch the Nura
clan's foundation crumble.

68
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:26,466
[laughter]

69
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:28,199
-Mere local deities.

70
00:04:28,233 --> 00:04:30,699
Let them attack in droves.

71
00:04:30,733 --> 00:04:34,133
I'll crush them one by
one with my own hands.

72
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:38,199
-This will be such
an easy conquest.

73
00:04:38,233 --> 00:04:39,533
-You're right about that.

74
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:45,633
[laughter]

75
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:47,033
-All right.

76
00:04:47,066 --> 00:04:49,866
I think it's time we all
went on a little rampage

77
00:04:49,899 --> 00:04:54,199
through Ukiyoe Town, and create
a little diversion to lure

78
00:04:54,233 --> 00:04:56,133
in their strongest fighters.

79
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:58,999
[laughter]

80
00:04:59,033 --> 00:05:01,933
[loud shout]

81
00:05:10,266 --> 00:05:11,166
[screaming]

82
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,533
-I didn't realize
how late it was.

83
00:05:12,566 --> 00:05:13,633
-Mmm.

84
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:16,133
I have to hurry home
before my dad gets mad.

85
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:18,066
[gasps]

86
00:05:21,466 --> 00:05:23,366
-What's going on?

87
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:25,733
[laughter]

88
00:05:25,766 --> 00:05:28,166
-S-- someone help!

89
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:28,999
-What?

90
00:05:29,033 --> 00:05:30,199
What's the matter?

91
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,999
-There's no mistaking it.

92
00:05:35,033 --> 00:05:35,499
Yokai.

93
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:42,466
-Damn it.

94
00:05:42,499 --> 00:05:44,499
Who the hell are these guys?

95
00:05:44,533 --> 00:05:46,799
-They've got some nerve
coming here and storming

96
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,099
our territory.

97
00:05:48,133 --> 00:05:49,799
What do you think they're up to?

98
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:52,299
-At this rate, it'll
turn into a war.

99
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:53,699
-They spell trouble.

100
00:05:56,766 --> 00:05:59,466
-It could be them.

101
00:05:59,499 --> 00:06:01,066
The Shikoku Yokai.

102
00:06:01,099 --> 00:06:02,599
The Seven Phantom Travelers.

103
00:06:02,633 --> 00:06:04,166
-The Seven Phantom Travelers?

104
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:06,566
-That name sounds familiar.

105
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:09,333
-They're Yokai who
represent Shikoku.

106
00:06:09,366 --> 00:06:12,033
-Could they be the ones
who killed Lord Hihi?

107
00:06:12,066 --> 00:06:14,866
-I'm not sure, but--

108
00:06:14,899 --> 00:06:18,499
-Well, it certainly
is a possibility.

109
00:06:18,533 --> 00:06:21,666
-Fortunately for us,
the humans are still

110
00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:25,933
unaware that Yokai are behind
this latest disturbance.

111
00:06:25,966 --> 00:06:28,866
-We must hurry and do something.

112
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:32,866
-So what's our plan, Master?

113
00:06:33,697 --> 00:06:34,897
-Say, did you hear?

114
00:06:34,931 --> 00:06:37,964
The Shikoku Yokai have shown
up and are running amok

115
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:39,131
all over town.

116
00:06:39,164 --> 00:06:40,197
-I heard, I heard.

117
00:06:40,231 --> 00:06:42,031
They're not ordinary Yokai.

118
00:06:42,064 --> 00:06:43,764
They're just
incorrigible brutes.

119
00:06:43,797 --> 00:06:45,797
-Yeah, a bunch of hooligans.

120
00:06:45,831 --> 00:06:47,964
-But why are they doing this?

121
00:06:47,997 --> 00:06:49,297
-Isn't it obvious?

122
00:06:49,331 --> 00:06:51,031
They plan to take
over our territory.

123
00:06:51,064 --> 00:06:51,564
-Ah!

124
00:06:51,597 --> 00:06:52,497
-Take over?

125
00:06:52,531 --> 00:06:54,231
-Yeah, and if they
succeed, it'll

126
00:06:54,264 --> 00:06:55,931
spell the end of the Nura clan.

127
00:06:55,964 --> 00:06:58,431
-Ahhh!

128
00:06:58,464 --> 00:07:02,731
-Making such a fuss over some
Yokai bumpkins from Shikoku.

129
00:07:02,764 --> 00:07:03,597
-Yeah.

130
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:04,997
Unlike the Gyuki
clan, this place

131
00:07:05,031 --> 00:07:06,464
is full of good-for-nothings.

132
00:07:06,497 --> 00:07:09,097
-How sad to think that
they're the main family.

133
00:07:09,131 --> 00:07:09,797
-That's for sure.

134
00:07:15,897 --> 00:07:17,964
-What'll happen to us?

135
00:07:17,997 --> 00:07:19,497
-You guys'll
probably end up being

136
00:07:19,531 --> 00:07:21,597
sliced up and served as sashimi.

137
00:07:21,631 --> 00:07:23,097
-Oh, no!

138
00:07:23,131 --> 00:07:25,764
-Oh, where's the Supreme
Commander when we need him?

139
00:07:25,797 --> 00:07:27,464
-Come on, everyone.

140
00:07:27,497 --> 00:07:29,064
Calm down.

141
00:07:29,097 --> 00:07:31,964
The Nura clan's going
to be absolutely fine.

142
00:07:31,997 --> 00:07:34,864
After all, we have someone
very special on our side.

143
00:07:34,897 --> 00:07:35,464
-Oh, really?

144
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:36,964
Who is it?

145
00:07:36,997 --> 00:07:40,464
-Aotabo or maybe Kurotabo?

146
00:07:40,497 --> 00:07:40,964
-Ha.

147
00:07:40,997 --> 00:07:42,097
The Master.

148
00:07:42,131 --> 00:07:44,364
Who else would I
be talking about?

149
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:46,797
As long as we have
Master Rikuo, there's

150
00:07:46,831 --> 00:07:49,264
absolutely nothing to fear,

151
00:07:49,297 --> 00:07:50,797
-Hmm.

152
00:07:50,831 --> 00:07:52,231
-Well, I suppose.

153
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:53,997
If you say so.

154
00:07:54,031 --> 00:07:54,897
Right?

155
00:07:54,931 --> 00:07:57,664
-Uh-- well, yes.

156
00:07:57,697 --> 00:07:58,997
What a relief.

157
00:07:59,031 --> 00:08:00,764
I guess.

158
00:08:00,797 --> 00:08:01,597
-Yes.

159
00:08:01,631 --> 00:08:02,731
Of course.

160
00:08:02,764 --> 00:08:03,964
Thank goodness.

161
00:08:03,997 --> 00:08:05,464
-Yes, it is.

162
00:08:05,497 --> 00:08:06,731
Just trust me.

163
00:08:06,764 --> 00:08:09,397
So let's not all jump to a
bunch of silly conclusions,

164
00:08:09,431 --> 00:08:11,831
and just stick to carrying
out our chores like always.

165
00:08:11,864 --> 00:08:12,664
OK?

166
00:08:12,697 --> 00:08:13,164
Hmm?

167
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,197
(VOICEOVER) Still, I can't
help but worry a little.

168
00:08:20,231 --> 00:08:24,197
What's going to happen to us?

169
00:08:24,231 --> 00:08:24,697
Hmm.

170
00:08:30,597 --> 00:08:31,931
-I wonder.

171
00:08:31,964 --> 00:08:35,031
Are those Shikoku Yokai serious
about taking over our clan?

172
00:08:45,064 --> 00:08:46,097
Gyuki.

173
00:08:46,131 --> 00:08:49,264
-Quite a predicament, isn't it?

174
00:08:49,297 --> 00:08:52,564
This is when your worth to the
Nura clan as the third heir

175
00:08:52,597 --> 00:08:55,131
will be called into question.

176
00:08:55,164 --> 00:08:56,964
[sigh]

177
00:08:56,997 --> 00:08:57,664
-Tread carefully.

178
00:09:01,597 --> 00:09:03,497
-Hmm.

179
00:09:03,531 --> 00:09:03,997
-Master!

180
00:09:08,897 --> 00:09:10,431
Are you sure about this?

181
00:09:10,464 --> 00:09:11,997
Considering what's
going on, I don't

182
00:09:12,031 --> 00:09:14,297
think you should be
leaving the house.

183
00:09:14,331 --> 00:09:16,397
-There's no telling
what may happen.

184
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:19,531
It's dangerous for
you to be outside.

185
00:09:19,564 --> 00:09:23,131
-The enemy is trying
to agitate us.

186
00:09:23,164 --> 00:09:25,297
It's important that
we don't panic,

187
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:27,764
because that's what
they want us to do.

188
00:09:27,797 --> 00:09:29,964
[sigh]

189
00:09:29,997 --> 00:09:32,731
-So we need to keep on living
our lives just like we always

190
00:09:32,764 --> 00:09:34,031
do.

191
00:09:34,064 --> 00:09:37,297
And wait until the enemy
shows us their true colors.

192
00:09:37,331 --> 00:09:39,297
-Master.

193
00:09:39,331 --> 00:09:39,797
-Understood.

194
00:09:46,264 --> 00:09:49,164
[bells ringing]

195
00:09:49,197 --> 00:09:49,731
-Hey, guys!

196
00:09:49,764 --> 00:09:50,864
Come over here.

197
00:09:50,897 --> 00:09:52,831
You've all got to
check this out.

198
00:09:52,864 --> 00:09:57,431
-Yokai are behind Ukiyoe
Town's calamities?

199
00:09:57,464 --> 00:09:59,431
-Wha-- what is this?

200
00:09:59,464 --> 00:10:01,431
-Countless posts about
the mysterious accidents

201
00:10:01,464 --> 00:10:02,797
and calamities
that have occurred

202
00:10:02,831 --> 00:10:05,564
all Ukiyoe Town since yesterday.

203
00:10:05,597 --> 00:10:08,997
And nearly all of them say
that they witnessed Yokai.

204
00:10:09,031 --> 00:10:09,564
-Really?

205
00:10:09,597 --> 00:10:11,097
This is scary.

206
00:10:11,131 --> 00:10:13,964
-So we're talking
about Yokai again?

207
00:10:13,997 --> 00:10:15,964
Don't you ever get tired?

208
00:10:15,997 --> 00:10:17,864
[laughter]

209
00:10:17,897 --> 00:10:19,264
-I don't believe it!

210
00:10:19,297 --> 00:10:21,931
You guys still don't understand
how serious all of this is,

211
00:10:21,964 --> 00:10:23,231
do you?

212
00:10:23,264 --> 00:10:25,531
There are even a bunch of
very detailed posts talking

213
00:10:25,564 --> 00:10:29,097
about indisputable sightings
of the infamous Shikoku Yokai,

214
00:10:29,131 --> 00:10:31,531
otherwise known as the
Seven Phantom Travelers.

215
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:33,731
Can't refute that, can you?

216
00:10:33,764 --> 00:10:34,297
Huh?

217
00:10:34,331 --> 00:10:35,664
Well, can you?

218
00:10:35,697 --> 00:10:38,331
-Who are the Seven
Phantom Travelers?

219
00:10:38,364 --> 00:10:41,297
-The Seven Phantom Travelers
are the most powerful and feared

220
00:10:41,331 --> 00:10:43,631
Yokai group in Shikoku.

221
00:10:43,664 --> 00:10:46,331
The story goes that anyone who
sees them on a mountain road

222
00:10:46,364 --> 00:10:48,264
will not return to
their village alive.

223
00:10:48,297 --> 00:10:48,797
[gasp]

224
00:10:48,831 --> 00:10:49,631
-Village?

225
00:10:49,664 --> 00:10:51,997
What era is that story from?

226
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:54,164
-You don't understand
anything, do you?

227
00:10:54,197 --> 00:10:56,531
You don't get it at all!

228
00:10:56,564 --> 00:10:58,664
-It's kind of scary how
those accidents took place

229
00:10:58,697 --> 00:10:59,531
all at once.

230
00:10:59,564 --> 00:11:02,931
Do you think it's a coincidence?

231
00:11:02,964 --> 00:11:05,497
Or was a Yokai really
behind all of it?

232
00:11:10,797 --> 00:11:13,097
Those Yokai.

233
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:15,564
-Everyone was talking
about the incident.

234
00:11:15,597 --> 00:11:16,097
-Yeah.

235
00:11:22,397 --> 00:11:25,264
-I just hope that nothing more
like that happens tonight.

236
00:11:25,297 --> 00:11:26,664
-It'll be OK.

237
00:11:26,697 --> 00:11:28,431
I told everyone to
keep their eyes open

238
00:11:28,464 --> 00:11:29,331
and be extra vigilant.

239
00:11:45,397 --> 00:11:47,497
-Pathetic humans.

240
00:11:47,531 --> 00:11:49,497
With the coming of
night, terror and chaos

241
00:11:49,531 --> 00:11:51,897
shall descend upon you.

242
00:11:51,931 --> 00:11:54,897
Ah!

243
00:11:54,931 --> 00:12:00,364
[shouting and screaming]

244
00:12:00,397 --> 00:12:01,864
-What was that?

245
00:12:01,897 --> 00:12:02,864
Come on, Yura.

246
00:12:02,897 --> 00:12:04,131
-Get back!

247
00:12:04,164 --> 00:12:04,597
-What?

248
00:12:04,631 --> 00:12:05,397
But--

249
00:12:05,431 --> 00:12:06,464
-I'll be fine.

250
00:12:06,497 --> 00:12:06,964
Go!

251
00:12:15,831 --> 00:12:18,631
-Her shikigame and onmyoji, eh?

252
00:12:18,664 --> 00:12:20,031
She'll make a sufficient foe.

253
00:12:20,064 --> 00:12:21,331
-I'll take you on.

254
00:12:24,031 --> 00:12:26,764
-Caw!

255
00:12:26,797 --> 00:12:28,897
-He's a fire-wielder.

256
00:12:28,931 --> 00:12:32,397
-I'm not averse to feisty girls.

257
00:12:32,431 --> 00:12:34,864
Caw!

258
00:12:34,897 --> 00:12:36,864
-Yura!

00:12:36,897 --> 00:12:37,364
[growl]

260
00:12:37,397 --> 00:12:38,464
-Hold it.

261
00:12:38,497 --> 00:12:39,164
-What?

262
00:12:39,197 --> 00:12:40,264
-You must deal with us.

263
00:12:40,297 --> 00:12:41,397
-Prepare yourself.

264
00:12:41,431 --> 00:12:42,331
-Who are you?

265
00:12:42,364 --> 00:12:43,797
-We are the Nura clan.

266
00:12:43,831 --> 00:12:44,797
Sanba Garasu!

267
00:12:56,597 --> 00:12:58,064
-Yura!

268
00:12:58,097 --> 00:12:59,464
Are you all right?

269
00:12:59,497 --> 00:13:00,531
-Yes.

270
00:13:00,564 --> 00:13:01,831
It's just a minor burn.

271
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:11,959
[theme music]

272
00:13:13,535 --> 00:13:14,469
-What?

273
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:15,769
Miss Kakine was injured?

274
00:13:15,802 --> 00:13:16,835
-Yes.

275
00:13:16,869 --> 00:13:18,633
In the park on the
way home from school.

276
00:13:18,667 --> 00:13:20,467
I think it was a Yokai.

277
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,100
It suddenly attacked
us from the sky.

278
00:13:22,133 --> 00:13:23,533
But we were saved.

279
00:13:23,567 --> 00:13:25,000
-Huh?

280
00:13:25,033 --> 00:13:28,000
-I don't know, but I'm pretty
sure our rescuers were also

281
00:13:28,033 --> 00:13:29,333
Yokai.

282
00:13:29,367 --> 00:13:32,000
They looked like a group
of really big black birds.

283
00:13:32,033 --> 00:13:33,267
-Black birds?

284
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,467
Crows?

285
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,267
-Yes, like crows.

286
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,900
-I see.

287
00:13:37,933 --> 00:13:46,333
-Rikuo You know I-- I think,
maybe, that Yokai really do

288
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,400
exist.

-So please, Rikuo.

00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,867
Be very careful.

292
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,300
-Um, yeah.

293
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,067
I sure will, Kana.

294
00:14:05,633 --> 00:14:06,800
Hmm?

295
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,500
-The top officers are
gathering in the mansion.

296
00:14:08,533 --> 00:14:13,167
They will likely expect some
answers from you, Rikuo.

297
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,033
-Hmm.

298

[growls and grunts]

301

-Back then, my Yokai blood
had awakened already.

302
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,000
But for a very long
time, I was in denial,

303
00:14:40,033 --> 00:14:42,433
because I had lots of friends.

304
00:14:42,467 --> 00:14:44,367
They were very
precious to me and I

305
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,367
wanted to be human
just like them.

306
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,967
But I also have a family
who are just as precious.

307
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,467
Just as important to me.

308
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,433
My Yokai family.

309
00:14:56,467 --> 00:14:58,800
And that's why I
will never forgive

310
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:02,800
anyone who dares to try to
hurt my friends and family.

311
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:03,700
Human or Yokai.

Gyuki.

00:15:07,967 --> 00:15:11,700
I'm not going to
run away anymore.

00:15:11,733 --> 00:15:13,467
-Good work, everyone.

315
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,633
You fired a brilliant
opening round of fireworks.

316
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:20,367
And now the curtain has
risen on our next act.

317
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,300
The stage is our
enemy's headquarters.

318
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:24,800
The Nura clan's mansion.

[panting]

320
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:38,900
-Well, well, brothers.

321
00:15:38,933 --> 00:15:41,033
I see you've all
come here as well.

322
00:15:41,067 --> 00:15:42,367
-Cut the act.

323
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,333
You're the one that arranged
this assembly, didn't you?

324
00:15:45,367 --> 00:15:48,333
-This is the most serious affair
since our clan was formed.

325
00:15:48,367 --> 00:15:49,800
I did what was necessary.

Surely you're not complaining.

-Damn it!

00:15:54,933 --> 00:15:58,600
How long must we
waste our time here?

If it isn't Shoei.

How you've grown since
the last I saw you.

Back then, you were still--

336
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:15,600
-Forget that.

337
00:16:15,633 --> 00:16:17,700
My old man was killed, remember?

338
00:16:17,733 --> 00:16:18,433
-Yes.

339
00:16:18,467 --> 00:16:19,100
Of course.

340
00:16:19,133 --> 00:16:21,100
You have my condolences.

341
00:16:21,133 --> 00:16:22,667
You're mad.

342
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,033
I know you feel.

343
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:25,400
And it really pains me.

344
00:16:25,433 --> 00:16:27,833
Who could blame you for
wanting to exact revenge

345
00:16:27,867 --> 00:16:29,267
on those who did this?

346
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,167
I would want the
same if I were you.

347
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,333
-Then let me go and do it.

348
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:36,367
Let me find my old man's
killers and make them pay.

349
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,533
-But in the absence of
the Supreme Commander,

350
00:16:38,567 --> 00:16:42,133
we have no one to rely
on but that Master.

351
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,400
-Hmm.

352
00:16:44,433 --> 00:16:47,167
-I don't care what
the Master thinks.

353
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,333
I will avenge my old man.

354
00:16:49,367 --> 00:16:50,200
-Yes.

355
00:16:50,233 --> 00:16:51,867
Well said, son of Hihi.

356
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,633
Spoken like a true
warrior of the clan.

357
00:16:54,667 --> 00:16:57,867
You're such a refreshing
change from our weak Master.

358
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,167
Don't you all agree?

359
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,533
It's very reassuring.

360
00:17:00,567 --> 00:17:03,233
[laughter]

361
00:17:03,267 --> 00:17:06,567
-Lord Hitotsume has a big mouth
to match that big head of his.

362
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,000
-He's making things
difficult for the Master.

363
00:17:09,033 --> 00:17:10,633
-But he does have a point.

364
00:17:10,667 --> 00:17:14,133
We need Master Rikuo to
take decisive action soon.

365
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:15,133
-Yeah.

366
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:18,033
You're right about that.

367
00:17:18,067 --> 00:17:20,267
-Mmm.

368
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:20,767
Huh?

369
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,200
Master!

370
00:17:22,233 --> 00:17:22,700
-Huh?

371
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,400
-I kept you waiting.

372
00:17:29,433 --> 00:17:30,567
Sorry.

373
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,467
-If it isn't Master Rikuo.

374
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,067
You're rather late,
don't you think?

375
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,533
-And you were awfully
early, Hitotsume.

376
00:17:37,567 --> 00:17:38,733
Weren't you?

377
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:41,633
-This is a serious affair
for the whole family.

378
00:17:41,667 --> 00:17:44,567
I dropped everything and
rushed over right away.

379
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,533
-Good.

380
00:17:45,567 --> 00:17:46,867
Then listen to
what I have to say.

381
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,100
From now on, no one is to
take any unauthorized action.

382
00:17:50,133 --> 00:17:51,667
You are not to act alone.

383
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,600
No matter what
happens, the Nura clan

384
00:17:53,633 --> 00:17:56,733
will be united and
face the enemy as one.

385
00:17:56,767 --> 00:17:58,500
Is that clear, Shoei?

386
00:17:58,533 --> 00:18:01,667
You must not go out and seek
vengeance all by yourself.

387
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,800
-But, Master!

388
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:05,433
By all rights, this has
to be an eye for an eye!

389
00:18:05,467 --> 00:18:07,133
-I don't blame you, Shoei.

390
00:18:07,167 --> 00:18:09,133
You're his son.

391
00:18:09,167 --> 00:18:12,333
-Shoei, I feel the
same way as you do.

392
00:18:12,367 --> 00:18:15,033
And that's why we just can't
let anything or anyone split

393
00:18:15,067 --> 00:18:16,100
us apart.

394
00:18:16,133 --> 00:18:17,567
Don't you get it?

395
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,667
That's exactly what
the enemy wants.

396
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,667
If Hihi were here now, he
would say the same thing.

397
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,967
[grunt]

398
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,067
-In any case, there's only
one way to deal with all this.

399
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,767
The clan must remain
strong and unyielding.

400
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:35,667
And so-- And so-- I
will lead the clan

401
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,133
in my grandfather's absence!

402
00:18:38,167 --> 00:18:41,967
[gasps]

403
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,933
-As the third heir
of the Nura clan.

404
00:18:43,967 --> 00:18:45,100
-Master!

405
00:18:45,133 --> 00:18:45,900
-Oh, yeah.

406
00:18:45,933 --> 00:18:47,600
Now you're talking, Master.

407
00:18:47,633 --> 00:18:51,033
-We're counting on you, Master.

408
00:18:51,067 --> 00:18:52,267
-Master.

409
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,233
I will follow your command.

410
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:56,400
-Thank you, Shoei.

411
00:18:56,433 --> 00:18:58,600
-However, even as
we speak, the enemy

412
00:18:58,633 --> 00:19:00,800
is continuing to
attack our land.

413
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:02,667
You say we will
not yield, but what

414
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,900
specific strategy do you have?

415
00:19:04,933 --> 00:19:07,500
-First of all, we will
tighten up security

416
00:19:07,533 --> 00:19:09,433
throughout our territory.

417
00:19:09,467 --> 00:19:11,667
You will all take
steps to do that.

418
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,833
-Ha.

419
00:19:12,867 --> 00:19:14,967
A strategy neither
interesting nor amusing.

420
00:19:17,667 --> 00:19:18,667
-You idiot.

421
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,267
You can't win a war
with only defense.

422
00:19:23,633 --> 00:19:26,533
[shouts and screams]

423
00:19:26,567 --> 00:19:27,500
[gasp]

424
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:29,467
-Hmm?

425
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,433
[gasp]

426
00:19:31,467 --> 00:19:32,400
Oh, honey.

427
00:19:32,433 --> 00:19:33,367
Why?

428
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,367
Why?

429
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,767
My honey.

430
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,367
-How could anyone do this?

431
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,000
-What happened here?

432
00:19:42,033 --> 00:19:42,933
-What's that?

433
00:19:42,967 --> 00:19:45,700
Intruder!

434
00:19:45,733 --> 00:19:48,300
The enemy has
infiltrated the house.

435
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:49,200
It's over!

436
00:19:49,233 --> 00:19:50,533
It's the end of the Nura clan!

437
00:19:50,567 --> 00:19:51,100
-Be quiet!

438
00:19:51,133 --> 00:19:52,133
That's enough.

439
00:19:52,167 --> 00:19:53,867
Stop making such a big ruckus.

440
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,767
What's important is to
find the one who did this.

441
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,167
-Rikuo Nura.

442
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,700
I am going to take your life.

443
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:01,200
-Huh?

444
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,667
-Come back here!

445
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,167
-Master!

-So.

452
00:21:10,967 --> 00:21:13,200
We meet again, Rikuo Nura.

453
00:21:39,433 --> 00:21:42,833
I've come to officially
offer my greetings.

454
00:21:42,867 --> 00:21:45,233
-Your greetings?

455
00:21:45,267 --> 00:21:46,000
-Yes.

456
00:21:46,033 --> 00:21:48,200
That's correct.

457
00:21:48,233 --> 00:21:50,967
(VOICEOVER) The Shikoku Yokai's
Seven Phantom Travelers,

led by the Inugamigyobu-Tanuki
Tamazuki, present themselves.

459
00:21:55,033 --> 00:21:58,433
A bloody battle without
honor is about to begin.

[theme music - in japanese]

-Tsurara, is your
body as cold as snow?

462
00:23:36,411 --> 00:23:37,511
-Yes, pretty much.

463
00:23:37,545 --> 00:23:39,578
-Then if we held hands,
would I get frostbite?

464
00:23:39,611 --> 00:23:40,511
-Oh, it's OK.

465
00:23:40,545 --> 00:23:41,745
You get used to
it after a while.

466
00:23:41,778 --> 00:23:42,245
See?

467
00:23:42,278 --> 00:23:42,845
-Ah!

468
00:23:42,878 --> 00:23:44,378
It's cold Tsurara.

Fire and Sudden Rain."
