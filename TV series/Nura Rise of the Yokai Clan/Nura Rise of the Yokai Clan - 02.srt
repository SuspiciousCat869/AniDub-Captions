00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:13,133
NARRATOR: In days of
old, people feared yokai.

2
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:17,066
The one who stood at the helm
and lead the night grave of 100

3
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:23,000
demons, was known as the
Supreme Commander of the yokai.

4
00:00:23,033 --> 00:00:25,433
They had another name for him.

5
00:00:25,466 --> 00:00:28,566
The Lord of
Pandemonium, Nurarihyon.

00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:33,500
[theme music]

7
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,250
-Why the long face?

8
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:42,530
-I-- I couldn't protect her.

9
00:02:42,563 --> 00:02:47,063
-So, you want to become strong?

10
00:02:47,096 --> 00:02:49,730
-Yeah, I guess so.

11
00:02:49,763 --> 00:02:52,063
-You don't even know
what being strong means,

12
00:02:52,096 --> 00:02:53,863
yet you wanna be strong, huh?

13
00:02:57,263 --> 00:02:57,730
-Huh?

14
00:03:27,363 --> 00:03:30,163
-Those things are
a damn nuisance.

15
00:03:30,196 --> 00:03:31,730
-Lord Zen, here you are.

16
00:03:31,763 --> 00:03:33,330
I've been looking for you.

17
00:03:33,363 --> 00:03:35,530
You mustn't overexert yourself.

18
00:03:35,563 --> 00:03:37,930
-I know.

19
00:03:37,963 --> 00:03:41,230
NARRATOR: An eerie shadow
lurks through the morning mist.

20
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:43,896
The footsteps of beings
not of this world

21
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,130
suddenly approach
the Nura mansion.

22
00:04:00,996 --> 00:04:03,263
-Supreme commander,
Lord Zen is here!

23
00:04:08,263 --> 00:04:10,996
[panting]

24
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,196
-Oh, Lord Zen!

25
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:13,430
What a pleasant surprise!

26
00:04:13,463 --> 00:04:16,296
-Oh, hey Yuki-Onna

27
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:17,796
-I'm glad you've come.

28
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:21,530
-Thank you, it's been quite
a while, Supreme Commander.

29
00:04:21,563 --> 00:04:24,430
-Rikuo should be returning
home shortly, too.

30
00:04:24,463 --> 00:04:26,763
ZEN: Excellent, I'm
greatly looking forward

31
00:04:26,796 --> 00:04:28,263
to seeing the third.

32
00:04:28,296 --> 00:04:30,596
-Mm-hmm.

33
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:34,163
-I'm afraid he hasn't been
formally installed yet.

34
00:04:34,196 --> 00:04:37,930
It's a little premature
to call him that.

35
00:04:37,963 --> 00:04:40,563
-I see nothing wrong with
addressing him respectfully

36
00:04:40,596 --> 00:04:42,796
by his future honorific.

37
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:45,730
He'll bear the responsibilities
of Nura Clans third air

38
00:04:45,763 --> 00:04:47,063
soon enough.

39
00:04:47,096 --> 00:04:51,630
-That Rikuo is giving
me such a hard time.

40
00:04:51,663 --> 00:04:53,696
I've told him time
and time again

41
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:58,630
it is his duty to succeed
me and become a yokai.

42
00:04:58,663 --> 00:05:00,496
One completely devoted to evil.

43
00:05:04,696 --> 00:05:05,230
-I'm home.

44
00:05:15,563 --> 00:05:18,430
-Wait a minute, where'd you
get those expensive sweets?

45
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:22,496
-Oh, Rikuo, don't tell me you
went to school again, huh?

46
00:05:25,496 --> 00:05:27,430
-Don't tell me you
went out and stole them

47
00:05:27,463 --> 00:05:28,696
from somewhere again.

48
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:31,430
I told you I wanted you to
go easy on the evil deeds!

49
00:05:31,463 --> 00:05:33,130
And I don't care that
your signature move

50
00:05:33,163 --> 00:05:34,830
is to take things
without being noticed.

51
00:05:34,863 --> 00:05:38,263
-Master, you've
got it all wrong.

52
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:41,496
These sweets are a generous
gift from Lord Zen.

53
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:42,496
-Huh?

54
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:44,563
Lord Zen is here right now?

55
00:05:44,596 --> 00:05:46,363
-Mm-hmm.

56
00:05:46,396 --> 00:05:48,363
-He's in the parlor?

57
00:05:48,396 --> 00:05:50,830
-You guys ate my share of mangu.

58
00:05:53,763 --> 00:05:55,030
-I wonder why he's here.

59
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:09,830
-Master?

60
00:06:09,863 --> 00:06:11,563
-Uh, yes?

61
00:06:11,596 --> 00:06:13,696
-It's been such a long time.

62
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:15,296
Master, it is I, Zen.

63
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:16,863
-Greetings, Lord Zen.

64
00:06:16,896 --> 00:06:18,663
It's good to see you.

65
00:06:18,696 --> 00:06:20,096
[laughs]

66
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,363
-No need to be so formal.

67
00:06:21,396 --> 00:06:24,430
Call me Zen.

68
00:06:24,463 --> 00:06:26,830
-So who is that yokai anyway?

69
00:06:26,863 --> 00:06:29,696
-Yes, and how does
he know our master?

70
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,530
-He's the head of the Zen Group.

71
00:06:31,563 --> 00:06:33,263
He used to come and
play with Master Rikuo

72
00:06:33,296 --> 00:06:34,896
when he was little.

73
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:38,696
He was like a big
brother to the Master.

74
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:39,196
-Excuse me?

75
00:06:44,996 --> 00:06:46,530
I have brought some tea for you.

76
00:06:52,862 --> 00:06:53,430
[boing]

77
00:06:53,463 --> 00:06:55,996
[crash]

78
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,463
-Oh no, master, I'm sorry!

79
00:06:57,496 --> 00:06:59,430
I'm sorry!

80
00:06:59,463 --> 00:07:03,330
[wind]

81
00:07:03,363 --> 00:07:04,430
-Yukeona!

82
00:07:04,463 --> 00:07:06,196
What are you doing?

83
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,430
How dare you treat
Master Rikuo my sworn

84
00:07:08,463 --> 00:07:09,430
brother with disrespect!

85
00:07:09,463 --> 00:07:11,830
There will be no mercy for you!

86
00:07:11,863 --> 00:07:13,296
-Please forgive me!

87
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:20,496
-Well, now that we've
got that out of the way,

88
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:22,896
what pranks have you
pulled today, Master?

89
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:24,530
-Uh, none.

90
00:07:24,563 --> 00:07:26,463
-By the way, I'm
very sorry I haven't

91
00:07:26,496 --> 00:07:28,863
been able to attend the
clan's general assembly.

92
00:07:28,896 --> 00:07:29,663
-Huh?

93
00:07:29,696 --> 00:07:31,163
Oh, don't worry about that.

94
00:07:31,196 --> 00:07:34,730
All they do there is brag
about their latest evil deeds.

95
00:07:34,763 --> 00:07:36,530
-Now, now, Master,
you know you really

96
00:07:36,563 --> 00:07:38,796
mustn't be saying
things like that.

97
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:41,196
After all, we both know
that you will one day

98
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,363
become the leader of all yokai.

99
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:44,563
-Uh--

100
00:07:44,596 --> 00:07:46,763
-Personally, I can't
wait for the glorious day

101
00:07:46,796 --> 00:07:49,830
when you finally take over
as the rightful third era

102
00:07:49,863 --> 00:07:50,930
of the Nura Clan.

103
00:07:50,963 --> 00:07:51,930
-Stop it, Zen.

104
00:07:51,963 --> 00:07:53,896
I'm not the successor, OK?

105
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,763
Besides, I'm human.

106
00:07:56,796 --> 00:07:58,296
-Don't you lie to me!

107
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:00,563
I've heard every one
of the rumors, Rikuo!

108
00:08:00,596 --> 00:08:01,963
[gasp]

109
00:08:01,996 --> 00:08:04,563
-Many in the clan believe that
you're some kind of a coward,

110
00:08:04,596 --> 00:08:07,963
and that none of the top brass
supports you as the heir.

111
00:08:07,996 --> 00:08:10,596
-Oh, you knew all that?

112
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:11,996
-Of course I knew.

113
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:14,363
So why don't you tell me
what's going on with you.

114
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,230
-Well, wouldn't it be weird
if the leader of all yokai

115
00:08:19,263 --> 00:08:20,263
was human?

116
00:08:20,296 --> 00:08:22,596
That's why I can't
be the successor.

117
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,996
It's impossible.

118
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:26,063
-Impossible?

119
00:08:26,096 --> 00:08:28,296
I will kill you,
you cowardly fool!

120
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:31,396
When did you turn
into such a weakling!

121
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,296
-Stop him, someone!

122
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:35,663
[yelling]

123
00:08:35,696 --> 00:08:39,730
-Lord Zen's wings are
poisonous, don't touch them!

124
00:08:39,763 --> 00:08:43,430
-I didn't pledge my life
to serve a loser like you!

125
00:08:43,463 --> 00:08:44,896
[coughs]

126
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:47,663
-Lord Zen!

127
00:08:47,696 --> 00:08:48,130
-Get away!

128
00:09:06,396 --> 00:09:09,330
-Um, excuse me?

129
00:09:09,363 --> 00:09:13,796
Is Rikuo at home right now?

130
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:14,763
Oh?

131
00:09:14,796 --> 00:09:20,257
[wind howling]

132
00:09:26,196 --> 00:09:26,863
-Oh, wow!

133
00:09:26,896 --> 00:09:29,830
What was that?

134
00:09:29,863 --> 00:09:32,796
-The Ayakashi known as
Zen is a bird yokai,

135
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:36,296
leader of the Zen Group, and a
master of potions and poisons.

136
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,130
When its wings are
soaked in sake,

137
00:09:38,163 --> 00:09:39,863
they turn into a
deadly poison that

138
00:09:39,896 --> 00:09:42,796
causes the internal
organs to fester.

139
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:45,663
Any medicine can
turn toxic over time.

140
00:09:45,696 --> 00:09:47,496
Similarly, members
of the Zen group

141
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:49,563
are said to be
beautiful at birth.

142
00:09:49,596 --> 00:09:52,463
But as they reach manhood,
their wings and feathers

143
00:09:52,496 --> 00:09:56,096
change into that of poison.

144
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:58,630
However, perhaps due
to this special treat,

145
00:09:58,663 --> 00:10:01,430
this Yokai group
is physically weak,

146
00:10:01,463 --> 00:10:04,363
and at any time could fade away.

147
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:08,196
They are ephemeral,
fragile yokai.

148
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:10,830
-Are you feeling
all right, Lord Zen?

149
00:10:10,863 --> 00:10:13,296
The third heir to the
Nura Clan is nothing more

150
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:15,896
than a spineless
and immature fool.

151
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:17,996
After you went through
such pains to see him.

152
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:24,163
-Let us succeed and break
away from the Nura Clan.

153
00:10:24,196 --> 00:10:26,430
You do not need the
influence of the Nura

154
00:10:26,463 --> 00:10:28,396
to make it on your own.

155
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:30,896
-You asked him to
come, didn't you?

156
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:31,863
-Huh?

157
00:10:31,896 --> 00:10:34,063
-Well, I suppose
you figured it out.

158
00:10:34,096 --> 00:10:35,796
-What the heck
were you thinking?

159
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:38,696
Lord Zen should not be
traveling in his condition.

160
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,163
You're terrible!

161
00:10:40,196 --> 00:10:41,963
-Terrible, huh?

162
00:10:41,996 --> 00:10:45,796
If that is what you think of
me, what you believe I am,

163
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:47,663
you won't inherit my Nura Clan.

164
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:53,830
-Good, because that's exactly
what I've been begging you for.

165
00:10:53,863 --> 00:10:56,463
And by the way, it's
not your Nura Clan.

166
00:10:56,496 --> 00:10:59,430
It's just a bunch of
trouble making yokai.

167
00:10:59,463 --> 00:11:01,496
-Master Rikuo, you
are sadly mistaken.

168
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,830
ZEN: Thank you, Hebidayu.

169
00:11:06,863 --> 00:11:12,196
We the Zen group, are greatly
indebted to the Nura Clan.

170
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:14,630
My father, my
grandfather, and myself

171
00:11:14,663 --> 00:11:16,530
were all physically weak.

172
00:11:16,563 --> 00:11:19,463
It was none other than Master
Nurarihyon and his clan

173
00:11:19,496 --> 00:11:22,430
who went out of their
way to protect us.

174
00:11:22,463 --> 00:11:25,796
And they treated us
equally as fellow yokai

175
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:27,830
-This is a map of
the Nura Clan's night

176
00:11:27,863 --> 00:11:29,663
parade of 100 demons.

177
00:11:29,696 --> 00:11:31,630
Here is the Nura Clan.

178
00:11:31,663 --> 00:11:33,163
There are many
other yokai groups

179
00:11:33,196 --> 00:11:35,130
which are affiliated
with our clans.

180
00:11:35,163 --> 00:11:40,130
Lord Mokugyo Daruma's Daruma
Group, and Lord Zen's Zen

181
00:11:40,163 --> 00:11:41,530
Group, for example.

182
00:11:41,563 --> 00:11:45,663
From ancient times, Japan
has been home to many yokai.

183
00:11:45,696 --> 00:11:49,363
Yokai of the sea, the mountains,
and inanimate objects.

184
00:11:49,396 --> 00:11:51,296
Nearly every one of
them are weak creatures

185
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:55,630
who dwell within the darkness,
protecting all those yokai who

186
00:11:55,663 --> 00:11:58,830
are weak has been one of the
duties of Master Nurari's

187
00:11:58,863 --> 00:11:59,830
Jones' Nura Clan.

188
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:07,396
-I have no more desire
to uphold that honor.

189
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:09,663
Not to that boy.

190
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:12,730
And the supreme commander
is getting older.

191
00:12:12,763 --> 00:12:15,963
Perhaps the end of
the Nura Clan is near.

192
00:12:15,996 --> 00:12:17,596
-As is yours.

193
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,096
-Huh?

194
00:12:30,692 --> 00:12:32,459
-Karasu Tengu, do
you really think

195
00:12:32,492 --> 00:12:34,092
we can catch up
to the Gloom Cart?

196
00:12:34,126 --> 00:12:36,826
-Yes, just leave
everything to me.

197
00:12:36,859 --> 00:12:37,926
Master, come this way.

198
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:39,692
It's the shortcut.

199
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:41,426
-I should have been
more honest with them

200
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:42,892
and told them how I really felt.

201
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:53,226
-Hebidayu.

202
00:12:55,926 --> 00:12:59,159
I suppose the anti-Rikuo
faction put you up to this.

203
00:13:02,926 --> 00:13:05,759
-No doubt Zen will ally
himself with Rikuo.

204
00:13:05,792 --> 00:13:07,059
-Yes.

205
00:13:07,092 --> 00:13:10,026
-If you cannot handle him,
I will send reinforcements.

206
00:13:10,059 --> 00:13:12,692
-I assure you
won't be necessary.

207
00:13:12,726 --> 00:13:16,359
I can handle that pathetic
weakling all by myself.

208
00:13:16,392 --> 00:13:19,526
Besides, I get the
pleasure of finishing off

209
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:21,892
someone who was once my boss.

210
00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:30,526
-Master Rikuo.

211
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,992
I see them.

212
00:13:32,026 --> 00:13:33,526
-So there they are.

213
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:35,292
-Please wait.

214
00:13:35,326 --> 00:13:38,292
Something is amiss.

215
00:13:38,326 --> 00:13:39,859
-What happened to
that pledge you

216
00:13:39,892 --> 00:13:42,626
made when we exchanged
cuts of loyalty.

217
00:13:42,659 --> 00:13:44,759
-Loyalty?

218
00:13:44,792 --> 00:13:46,492
What are you talking about?

219
00:13:46,526 --> 00:13:50,026
-You are a pitiful,
cowardly traitor.

220
00:13:50,059 --> 00:13:52,992
-The way I see it,
you betrayed me first.

221
00:13:53,026 --> 00:13:54,426
-How's that?

222
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:56,492
-I would have enjoyed
my current position

223
00:13:56,526 --> 00:14:00,326
if you had bothered to become
more powerful and influential.

224
00:14:00,359 --> 00:14:03,059
But no, you always put
the Nura Clan first,

225
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,992
it was always for their sake.

226
00:14:05,026 --> 00:14:08,992
You don't have a shred of
ambition in your weak body.

227
00:14:09,026 --> 00:14:11,459
I'm sick of you.

228
00:14:11,492 --> 00:14:14,759
-Guess what, They'll have no
use for you once I'm dead.

229
00:14:14,792 --> 00:14:17,026
-That may be true.

230
00:14:17,059 --> 00:14:19,059
When that happens, so be it.

231
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:22,126
But now, this is
what I have to do.

232
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:23,659
-I see.

233
00:14:23,692 --> 00:14:27,459
But I still have unfinished
business to take care of.

234
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:29,459
[coughs]

235
00:14:29,492 --> 00:14:32,492
-You're talking about that
idiot son of the Nura Clan.

236
00:14:32,526 --> 00:14:36,126
You're still harping
on about him.

237
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:39,659
-I can't-- I can't let you
kill me here in the middle

238
00:14:39,692 --> 00:14:41,992
of nowhere, I refuse
to let it happen.

239
00:14:42,026 --> 00:14:44,659
-Flap your little wings and
fight as much as you like,

240
00:14:44,692 --> 00:14:46,459
but right now your going to die!

241
00:14:56,892 --> 00:14:58,926
-Karasu Tengu.

242
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,526
-Lord Zen, are you all right?

243
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:01,892
-What are you doing out here?

244
00:15:01,926 --> 00:15:03,592
-I had to apologize to you.

245
00:15:03,626 --> 00:15:06,326
I wanted to make you
understand, so I came after you.

246
00:15:06,359 --> 00:15:08,092
-Where are your bodyguards?

247
00:15:08,126 --> 00:15:12,692
You know that I'm not
capable of protecting you.

248
00:15:12,726 --> 00:15:14,826
-Karasu Tengu, who is that?

249
00:15:14,859 --> 00:15:19,226
-An officer of the
Zen Group, Hebidayu.

250
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:21,426
-What a perfect opportunity.

251
00:15:21,459 --> 00:15:25,259
I'll kill Nurarihyon's
grandson and win ultimate glory

252
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:30,026
for myself as the head of
the new Hebidayu group.

253
00:15:30,059 --> 00:15:32,659
-Hebidayu, you're unforgivable.

254
00:15:32,692 --> 00:15:34,426
Rikuo, get away.

255
00:15:34,459 --> 00:15:35,759
You can't win against him.

256
00:15:35,792 --> 00:15:37,692
-Die!

257
00:15:37,726 --> 00:15:38,626
-Rikuo!

258
00:15:38,659 --> 00:15:40,092
-You just stay still.

259
00:15:40,126 --> 00:15:40,859
-What the?

260
00:15:43,826 --> 00:15:44,292
You're--

261
00:15:50,321 --> 00:15:56,059
-If you had within even
an ounce of Zen's honor,

262
00:15:56,092 --> 00:15:58,859
I might have at least spared
your miserable little life.

263
00:16:18,626 --> 00:16:21,059
-Just who are you?

264
00:16:21,092 --> 00:16:23,359
-It's Master Rikuo.

265
00:16:23,392 --> 00:16:23,959
-That's Rikuo?

266
00:16:28,592 --> 00:16:29,992
-Zen, what's up?

267
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:36,626
ZEN: I see.

268
00:16:40,926 --> 00:16:46,492
So the stories of you being
one-fourth yokai are true.

269
00:16:46,526 --> 00:16:49,726
And yet here I am,
full-fledged, full-blooded yokai

270
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,826
and yet I was totally helpless.

271
00:16:54,659 --> 00:16:57,326
Hey Rikuo, the way
you are right now,

272
00:16:57,359 --> 00:16:59,859
you could become
the third, you know?

273
00:16:59,892 --> 00:17:03,059
It would be great to
see you lead the clan.

274
00:17:03,092 --> 00:17:03,959
While I'm still alive.

275
00:17:08,126 --> 00:17:09,226
-You wanna drink?

276
00:17:09,259 --> 00:17:10,792
-Yes, I'd like that.

277
00:17:10,826 --> 00:17:12,492
Would you pour one for me?

278
00:17:18,426 --> 00:17:21,592
-I feel bad about
Hebidayu, and it's all

279
00:17:21,626 --> 00:17:23,826
because I'm such a weak leader.

280
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:26,092
It must've been
unbearably hard on him.

281
00:17:29,592 --> 00:17:33,626
Exchange sake cups
with me, Rikuo.

282
00:17:33,659 --> 00:17:36,759
I want to officially
become your sworn brother.

283
00:17:36,792 --> 00:17:41,292
If i'm going to die anyway
I want to die serving you,

284
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:42,892
and no one else.

285
00:17:42,926 --> 00:17:46,059
-You sure about that?

286
00:17:46,092 --> 00:17:47,726
-I am.

287
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:51,226
And I'll stake whatever
life I have left on you.

288
00:17:51,259 --> 00:17:52,426
As you are now.

289
00:17:57,592 --> 00:18:00,992
-All right, you're a weak
yokai, so I'll protect you.

290
00:18:01,026 --> 00:18:03,959
And you will support me.

291
00:18:03,992 --> 00:18:08,392
Besides, there's a good reason
why you can't die, isn't there?

292
00:18:08,426 --> 00:18:10,126
-So, you were eavesdropping?

293
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:10,592
-Heh.

294
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:14,726
-How mischievous of you.

295
00:18:29,626 --> 00:18:31,092
-Ah--

296
00:18:31,126 --> 00:18:33,092
-Karasu.

297
00:18:33,126 --> 00:18:34,759
-Yes, Master?

298
00:18:34,792 --> 00:18:38,359
-With how many yokai must
I exchange cups of loyalty

299
00:18:38,392 --> 00:18:40,126
before they acknowledge me?

300
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:40,659
-Huh?

301
00:18:44,659 --> 00:18:49,259
I am going to become
the third heir.

302
00:18:49,292 --> 00:18:50,492
-Yes sir!

303
00:18:50,526 --> 00:18:53,826
What a pity, when dawn
breaks, he'll become human.

304
00:18:53,859 --> 00:18:55,592
[sobs]

305
00:18:55,626 --> 00:18:58,459
-Such a pity indeed!

306
00:18:58,492 --> 00:19:00,826
-I'm off to school!

307
00:19:00,859 --> 00:19:01,326
-Hurry up!

308
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:02,259
-Right!

309
00:19:02,292 --> 00:19:03,626
-Can you do me a favor?

310
00:19:03,659 --> 00:19:06,592
Rikuo forgot to take
his lunch again.

311
00:19:06,626 --> 00:19:08,359
-Oh sure, of course I will.

312
00:19:08,392 --> 00:19:09,492
Huh?

313
00:19:09,526 --> 00:19:11,926
-The other two lunches
are for you and Aotabo.

314
00:19:11,959 --> 00:19:16,059
I'm sorry, I mean they are
for Kurata and you, Tsurara.

315
00:19:16,092 --> 00:19:17,659
-Thank you.

316
00:19:17,692 --> 00:19:18,626
We're off!

317
00:19:27,126 --> 00:19:28,459
-Ah, man.

318
00:19:28,492 --> 00:19:30,559
My head feels all fuzzy.

319
00:19:30,592 --> 00:19:33,926
What exactly
happened last night?

320
00:19:33,959 --> 00:19:35,726
Ah, good morning Kana.

321
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:37,092
-Ah, good morning.

322
00:19:37,126 --> 00:19:39,626
Guess we both got
here early today.

323
00:19:39,659 --> 00:19:42,326
RIKUO (VOICEOVER): It's nice
whenever I get to see Kana,

324
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:44,559
it makes me feel
like a normal human.

325
00:19:44,592 --> 00:19:46,026
-Ah, hi guys.

326
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:47,992
I haven't seen you
since that night.

327
00:19:48,026 --> 00:19:49,392
-Hey, Kiyotsugu.

328
00:19:49,426 --> 00:19:51,692
-Both of you saw those
things there, didn't you?

329
00:19:51,726 --> 00:19:52,259
-Huh?

330
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:53,626
-Uh, saw what?

331
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:55,292
They were supposed
to have been there,

332
00:19:55,326 --> 00:19:57,292
inside the old school building.

333
00:19:57,326 --> 00:19:58,459
I mean yokai!

334
00:19:58,492 --> 00:19:59,292
Right?

335
00:19:59,326 --> 00:20:00,959
You saw the yokai, right Rikuo?

336
00:20:00,992 --> 00:20:02,459
-(GASPING) I can't breathe!

337
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:04,559
-So then are you
saying that you didn't

338
00:20:04,592 --> 00:20:06,792
see these yokai yourself?

339
00:20:06,826 --> 00:20:07,326
-Huh?

340
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:08,092
Who are you?

341
00:20:08,126 --> 00:20:10,326
-My name's Tsurara Oikawa.

342
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:12,959
The two of you are Kiyotsugu
and Shima from the next class,

343
00:20:12,992 --> 00:20:13,859
aren't you?

344
00:20:13,892 --> 00:20:16,426
-So, Tsurara Oikawa, huh?

345
00:20:16,459 --> 00:20:19,992
-Maybe you panicked and ran
away and didn't see them?

346
00:20:20,026 --> 00:20:21,126
-No, not at all.

347
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:23,159
I stayed until the very
end, but regretfully I

348
00:20:23,192 --> 00:20:24,792
didn't see anything.

349
00:20:24,826 --> 00:20:26,959
So I guess there
weren't any yokai there.

350
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:29,159
No yokai in the old
school building.

351
00:20:29,192 --> 00:20:31,192
[laughs]

352
00:20:31,226 --> 00:20:32,792
-Yuki-Onna.

353
00:20:32,826 --> 00:20:35,126
-Oh, Master!

354
00:20:35,159 --> 00:20:37,259
From now on, please
don't leave for school

355
00:20:37,292 --> 00:20:38,626
without the two of us with you.

356
00:20:38,659 --> 00:20:40,026
Oh, and take this.

357
00:20:40,059 --> 00:20:41,259
It's your lunch box.

358
00:20:41,292 --> 00:20:43,392
Your mother asked us to make
sure that you've got it.

359
00:20:55,692 --> 00:20:57,559
-What are you doing?

360
00:20:57,592 --> 00:20:59,892
-I don't want you hanging
around me like that.

361
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:01,892
-I will always be by your side.

362
00:21:01,926 --> 00:21:04,492
-I just want to spend my
days at school in peace.

363
00:21:04,526 --> 00:21:06,559
-Yes, I promise no
one in school will

364
00:21:06,592 --> 00:21:08,092
learn the secret of your body.

365
00:21:08,126 --> 00:21:10,326
-The-- the secret of my body?

366
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:11,926
What does that mean?

367
00:21:11,959 --> 00:21:14,226
-Hmm.

368
00:21:14,259 --> 00:21:16,526
-Uh-- All right, fine.

369
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,092
But just don't call me Master
here or outside of the house,

370
00:21:19,126 --> 00:21:19,926
OK?

371
00:21:19,959 --> 00:21:21,159
-OK, I won't.

372
00:21:21,192 --> 00:21:23,392
And you can go ahead
and call me Tsurara.

373
00:21:23,426 --> 00:21:24,926
-Tsu-- Tsurara?

374
00:21:24,959 --> 00:21:25,426
-Yes.

375
00:21:28,492 --> 00:21:30,626
-I've seen them in somewhere.

376
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:34,026
Why is she bringing
him his lunch?

377
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:36,959
I guess there's a lot of things
I don't know about Rikuo.

378
00:21:41,726 --> 00:21:44,692
-I'm from Kyoto.

379
00:21:44,726 --> 00:21:47,026
My name is Yura Keikain.

380
00:21:47,059 --> 00:21:49,892
It's nice to meet all of you.

381
00:21:49,926 --> 00:21:53,726
-She's so pretty.

382
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:56,126
[sigh]

383
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,726
-Rikuo had no recollection
of having transformed.

384
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:03,159
And what is the true
identity of this strange girl

385
00:22:03,192 --> 00:22:06,292
who suddenly appeared?

386
00:22:09,527 --> 00:22:12,927
[theme music]

387
00:23:38,681 --> 00:23:40,915
-Do you know why Master's
hair stands sideways

388
00:23:40,948 --> 00:23:41,781
in its night form?

389
00:23:41,815 --> 00:23:42,281
-Huh?

390
00:23:42,315 --> 00:23:43,648
Why, why?

391
00:23:43,681 --> 00:23:45,948
-I hear it's simply because
his head is long to the side.

392
00:23:45,981 --> 00:23:47,915
-That's just terrible.

393
00:23:47,948 --> 00:23:52,781
-Next time, Yura Keikain and
the Kiyojuji Paranormal Patrol.
