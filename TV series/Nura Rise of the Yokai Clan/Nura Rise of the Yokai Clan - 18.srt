1
00:00:09,411 --> 00:00:13,544
(VOICEOVER) In days of
old, people feared Yokai.

2
00:00:13,578 --> 00:00:17,478
The one who stood at the helm
and led the Night Parade of 100

3
00:00:17,511 --> 00:00:23,244
demons was known as the
Supreme Commander of the Yokai.

4
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:25,844
They had another name for him.

5
00:00:25,878 --> 00:00:28,111
The Lord of Pandemonium.

6
00:00:28,144 --> 00:00:28,611
Nurarihyon.

00:00:31,578 --> 00:00:33,478
[theme music - in japanese]

8
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:07,525
-This one's destroyed, too.

9
00:02:07,559 --> 00:02:09,292
-This is the second one today.

10
00:02:09,325 --> 00:02:11,592
You think a Yokai is
behind all of this?

11
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:14,592
-That's what we're going to find
out with this investigation.

12
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:17,359
We can't let Yura and the
girls beat us to the answer.

13
00:02:17,392 --> 00:02:18,625
-Oh, right!

14
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:21,025
-This was their plan all along.

15
00:02:21,059 --> 00:02:23,459
To destroy the local
deities and weaken

16
00:02:23,492 --> 00:02:25,425
the Nura clan's source of power.

17
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:27,859
They carefully executed
it so that we wouldn't

18
00:02:27,892 --> 00:02:29,659
realize what's really happening.

19
00:02:29,692 --> 00:02:34,525
The 88 Demons of Shikoku and
Inugami Gyoubu-danuki Tamazuki.

20
00:02:51,992 --> 00:02:54,792
-Hey, it's kind of
dark and scary here.

21
00:02:54,825 --> 00:02:59,559
-Yeah, especially since we're
right behind the hospital.

22
00:02:59,592 --> 00:03:00,292
-Hey.

23
00:03:00,325 --> 00:03:03,225
I think we found one.

24
00:03:03,259 --> 00:03:03,725
-Oh.

25
00:03:08,392 --> 00:03:09,992
-It's filthy.

26
00:03:10,025 --> 00:03:12,759
It's so old it's hard to tell
if it's been wrecked by someone

27
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:13,892
or not.

28
00:03:13,925 --> 00:03:16,425
-The deity of this
shrine must be ancient.

29
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:18,792
Maybe people stopped
coming and the shrine just

30
00:03:18,825 --> 00:03:22,025
collapsed because
it was neglected.

31
00:03:22,059 --> 00:03:24,292
-I never knew this shrine
existed in our territory.

32
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:29,492
-Hey there, everyone!

33
00:03:29,525 --> 00:03:31,759
-Huh?

34
00:03:31,792 --> 00:03:33,859
-What do you say
we call it a day?

35
00:03:33,892 --> 00:03:36,692
We should go back to the
house before it gets too dark.

36
00:03:36,725 --> 00:03:37,692
-How come?

37
00:03:37,725 --> 00:03:39,725
Do you have some
sort of curfew, Nura?

38
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:42,625
-No, it's just that my mom
will have dinner ready soon.

39
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:44,092
-Hey, I've got a great idea.

40
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,825
Yura, why don't you
come over to the house

41
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:47,525
too and have dinner with us?

42
00:03:47,559 --> 00:03:48,359
-Huh?

43
00:03:48,392 --> 00:03:49,892
-It's not your house, you know.

44
00:03:49,925 --> 00:03:51,425
-You really should join us.

45
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:54,425
Wakana's cooking
is totally awesome.

46
00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:56,625
-Yeah, her doughnuts
were fantastic.

47
00:03:56,659 --> 00:03:58,725
Maybe I will join you after all.

48
00:03:58,759 --> 00:03:59,592
-Huh?

49
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:01,459
-Hey, what's the matter, Rikuo?

50
00:04:01,492 --> 00:04:03,592
-Oh, uh, it's nothing at all.

51
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:05,025
-You're not worried
that your mom's

52
00:04:05,059 --> 00:04:06,992
going to break more
dishes, are you?

53
00:04:07,025 --> 00:04:09,025
-Let's go back, then.

54
00:04:09,059 --> 00:04:11,792
Everyone stay alert
for any signs of Yokai.

55
00:04:11,825 --> 00:04:15,892
We'll keep investigating
until we get home.

56
00:04:15,925 --> 00:04:19,025
-Our plan seems to be
moving along smoothly.

57
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:21,692
-But Tamazuki, those
Nura-clan weaklings

58
00:04:21,725 --> 00:04:23,225
are onto our strategy.

59
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:25,292
Last night, they
didn't take the bait

60
00:04:25,325 --> 00:04:27,259
during the ruckus
at Yokai Alley.

61
00:04:27,292 --> 00:04:30,892
Not only that, they managed
to take down Inu Hou-ou.

62
00:04:30,925 --> 00:04:32,359
-Calm down, Tearai Oni.

63
00:04:32,392 --> 00:04:34,559
-There is no need to panic.

64
00:04:34,592 --> 00:04:36,592
-Huh?

65
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:37,592
-Fool.

66
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:38,725
You turned around
and looked at him.

67
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:41,292
-Give him your sleeve
before it's too late.

68
00:04:41,325 --> 00:04:42,225
-Huh?

69
00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:44,159
Oh!

70
00:04:44,192 --> 00:04:45,759
-Take it easy.

71
00:04:45,792 --> 00:04:48,892
Last night we had
interference, but today I

72
00:04:48,925 --> 00:04:52,425
promise to exterminate all the
local deities of this town.

73
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,359
-That's some
confidence you have.

74
00:04:54,392 --> 00:04:57,959
With that spirit, you won't
be needing to have any guards.

75
00:04:57,992 --> 00:05:00,425
[panting]

76
00:05:06,425 --> 00:05:07,392
-All right.

77
00:05:07,425 --> 00:05:08,625
Gather around, everyone.

78
00:05:08,659 --> 00:05:11,492
It's time for our daily
Kiyotsugu Yokai storytelling

79
00:05:11,525 --> 00:05:12,459
session.

80
00:05:12,492 --> 00:05:13,392
-OK.

81
00:05:13,425 --> 00:05:14,592
-Sorry, count me out.

82
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,359
I'm going to go help Mrs. Nura.

83
00:05:16,392 --> 00:05:17,325
-Hey, come back!

84
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:17,992
-Boy.

85
00:05:18,025 --> 00:05:19,525
Another tiring day.

86
00:05:19,559 --> 00:05:20,892
I'd better touch up my makeup.

87
00:05:20,925 --> 00:05:21,825
Huh?

88
00:05:21,859 --> 00:05:23,725
What are you doing, Natsume?

89
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:24,825
-Oh, it's nothing.

90
00:05:27,559 --> 00:05:28,059
-Oh.

91
00:05:28,092 --> 00:05:29,125
Origami!

92
00:05:29,159 --> 00:05:30,559
-Hey, come on.

93
00:05:30,592 --> 00:05:32,392
What are you doing over there?

94
00:05:32,425 --> 00:05:33,792
And where's Oikawa?

95
00:05:33,825 --> 00:05:35,359
Has anyone seen her?

96
00:05:35,392 --> 00:05:35,992
-Oh, yeah.

97
00:05:36,025 --> 00:05:37,659
Where did she go?

98
00:05:37,692 --> 00:05:38,725
-Here you are.

99
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:39,992
I've been looking for you.

100
00:05:40,025 --> 00:05:41,125
-Yeah.

101
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:41,959
Don't worry.

102
00:05:41,992 --> 00:05:43,692
I'll go back in soon.

103
00:05:43,725 --> 00:05:46,792
-Are you thinking about
last night's Yokai?

104
00:05:46,825 --> 00:05:50,859
-Grandpa told me the local
deities-- they're frail.

105
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:54,792
But they provided support
to the Nura clan for ages.

106
00:05:54,825 --> 00:05:56,259
-Master.

107
00:05:56,292 --> 00:05:58,692
-That's why we have
to put a stop to this.

108
00:06:02,325 --> 00:06:03,692
Kuromaru.

109
00:06:03,725 --> 00:06:05,159
-As you ordered.

110
00:06:05,192 --> 00:06:07,359
We've tightened the
security around every shrine

111
00:06:07,392 --> 00:06:10,292
in this area where local
deities are known to live.

112
00:06:10,325 --> 00:06:11,059
-Good.

113
00:06:11,092 --> 00:06:12,292
Thank you.

114
00:06:12,325 --> 00:06:15,425
You know, we put guards
at just about every site,

115
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:18,025
but it just doesn't
seem to be enough.

116
00:06:18,059 --> 00:06:20,159
-We're using crows
from all over town

117
00:06:20,192 --> 00:06:22,425
to keep an eye on
every location we can.

118
00:06:22,459 --> 00:06:25,992
But our territory is enormous
and includes dozens and dozens

119
00:06:26,025 --> 00:06:29,259
of smaller local deities
that we aren't even aware of.

120
00:06:29,292 --> 00:06:30,492
-Master.

121
00:06:30,525 --> 00:06:32,759
-Speaking of smaller shines
we never knew about--

122
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:33,259
-Huh?

123
00:06:37,059 --> 00:06:40,325
[giggle]

124
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:41,892
-That Ao is unbelievable.

125
00:06:41,925 --> 00:06:43,559
He was supposed to
trade shifts with me,

126
00:06:43,592 --> 00:06:45,325
only to show up 20 minutes late.

127
00:06:45,359 --> 00:06:46,259
He's always like that.

128
00:06:46,292 --> 00:06:47,059
It drives me crazy.

129
00:06:49,592 --> 00:06:50,125
-Huh?

130
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,059
-Huh?

131
00:06:51,092 --> 00:06:52,992
-Oh!

132
00:06:53,025 --> 00:06:56,292
Oh, I'm so sorry!

133
00:06:56,325 --> 00:06:56,992
-Damn!

134
00:06:57,025 --> 00:06:59,325
It's Master's classmate!

135
00:06:59,359 --> 00:07:00,825
-Uh--

136
00:07:00,859 --> 00:07:03,792
-Uh--

137
00:07:03,825 --> 00:07:06,292
[giggle]

138
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:12,725
[sigh]

139
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:13,225
-Huh?

140
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:20,825
-Hmm.

141
00:07:20,859 --> 00:07:23,692
That is probably the
shrine of Lord Senba.

142
00:07:23,725 --> 00:07:24,692
-Lord Senba?

143
00:07:24,725 --> 00:07:26,892
-I've never heard
that name before.

144
00:07:26,925 --> 00:07:29,625
Can you tell us what
kind of deity he is?

145
00:07:29,659 --> 00:07:31,725
-He is an ancient
local deity who

146
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,392
was said to possess
healing powers.

147
00:07:33,425 --> 00:07:36,492
He used to gather a lot
of the people's faith.

148
00:07:36,525 --> 00:07:38,125
-I see.

149
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:40,592
[gasp]

150
00:07:52,092 --> 00:07:53,359
-Hey!

151
00:07:53,392 --> 00:07:55,792
Nura, Oikawa., where have
you two been all this time?

152
00:07:55,825 --> 00:07:57,125
-Yeah, Oikawa?

153
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:59,292
-Oh, we just uh-- huh?

154
00:07:59,325 --> 00:08:01,592
Where did Kana and Tori go?

155
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:03,892
-Kana is helping
your mom with dinner.

156
00:08:03,925 --> 00:08:08,459
Nastume is-- I have no
idea where she ran off to.

157
00:08:08,492 --> 00:08:09,959
-What?

158
00:08:09,992 --> 00:08:12,425
-Until a while ago,
Tori was folding origami

159
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:15,625
and not paying any attention at
all to the story I was telling.

160
00:08:15,659 --> 00:08:17,159
-Yeah, paper cranes!

161
00:08:17,192 --> 00:08:20,959
Oh my best day, I can only
fold a simple sailboat.

162
00:08:20,992 --> 00:08:22,925
[running footsteps]

163
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:24,359
-Not again.

164
00:08:24,392 --> 00:08:25,159
-Man.

165
00:08:25,192 --> 00:08:28,292
What is their problem?

00:08:28,325 --> 00:08:30,059
-Hmm.

167
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:33,092
-I'm sorry I haven't
been coming by lately.

168
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:34,559
Lord Senba?

169
00:08:34,592 --> 00:08:39,059
I want to thank you for
that time you helped us.

170
00:08:39,092 --> 00:08:39,525
Hmm.

171
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,492
There.

-Stop!

00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,359
-Oh!

176
00:08:55,392 --> 00:08:59,292
-Praying to a rusty old deity
like this won't work, you know.

177
00:08:59,325 --> 00:09:02,325
You should call my name instead.

178
00:09:02,359 --> 00:09:05,092
I am Lord Sodemogi.

Who the hell are you?

A Yokai from the Nura clan?

-Tori won't die, will she?

-She'll be OK.

197
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,766
I won't let that happen.

198
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,600
But, Rikuo--

199
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,100
-Really?

200
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,300
You really meant
it, right, Nura?

201
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:40,300
-Hmm.

202
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:41,900
Stay here, everyone.

203
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:43,133
You too, Oikawa.

204
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:43,633
-Huh?

205
00:10:50,266 --> 00:10:50,733
-Huh?

-Kuro!

-Master!

208
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,733
Please forgive me.

209
00:10:55,766 --> 00:10:58,366
I was near, and yet
I allowed our enemy

210
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,300
to endanger the
life of your friend.

211

I swear to you,
right here and now,

212
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:06,700
that I will find that
Jizo Yokai and force

213
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:10,366
him to tell us a way
to save the girl.

214
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,633
-Unfortunately--

215
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:12,566
-Huh?

216
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,766
-Who is there?

217
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,233
-That may not be possible.

218
00:11:21,066 --> 00:11:26,466
I am Senba, the ancient local
deity who is enshrined here.

219
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,900
Master Rikuo.

220
00:11:27,933 --> 00:11:29,700
I am honored to meet you.

-Lord Senba.

222
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:32,400
You're him?

223
00:11:32,433 --> 00:11:33,466
-Yes.

224
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,200
I've lived in these
parts for a long time,

225
00:11:36,233 --> 00:11:40,366
healing the illnesses of all
those who came here to pray.

226
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,766
-Well, then, can't you
use your healing powers

227
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,600
to save Master Rikuo's friend?

228
00:11:45,633 --> 00:11:46,733
-No.

229
00:11:46,766 --> 00:11:49,900
What ails that girl is a curse.

230
00:11:49,933 --> 00:11:52,300
At this time, I am
not powerful enough

231
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,233
to break such a strong curse.

232
00:11:54,266 --> 00:11:56,733
I'm sorry, but I
cannot heal her.

233
00:11:56,766 --> 00:11:59,600
-Are you saying there's
nothing we can do to save her?

234
00:11:59,633 --> 00:12:03,200
Not even with the
power of a local deity?

235
00:12:03,233 --> 00:12:05,133
-In that case,
we'll have to break

236
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:09,433
the curse by defeating Sodemogi.

237
00:12:09,466 --> 00:12:10,800
-Yes.

238
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:14,466
-Then we have no time to waste.

239
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,000
-Good thing the moon is rising.

240
00:12:23,266 --> 00:12:24,700
Oh.

241
00:12:24,733 --> 00:12:25,200
Hmm.

242
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:49,166
-You summoned us, Master Rikuo?

243
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,433
-I want you to go
and find Sodemogi.

244
00:12:52,466 --> 00:12:54,600
He and I have a big
score to settle.

245
00:12:54,633 --> 00:12:55,100
-Right.

246
00:12:59,033 --> 00:13:02,466
-Just leave the fighting to us.

247
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,700
Come on, Kuro.

248
00:13:03,733 --> 00:13:04,300
-Yes, sir.

Master Rikuo.

256
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:48,833
I found him in the woods.

beat you to it, Tosakamaru.

-There's no use in
fretting like that.

The only thing we can do is stay
positive and try and support

just the right things.

you are dealing with?

you crave belongs to me.

1,000 origami cranes

333
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,900
to pray for Tori's recovery.

334
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:45,733
-What are her vitals?

335
00:18:45,766 --> 00:18:47,200
-It's gone below 100, Doctor.

336
00:18:47,233 --> 00:18:48,900
Diastolic pressure is under 60.

337
00:18:48,933 --> 00:18:49,366
-Oxygen.

338
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,366
Stat.

339
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,833
-Her saturation
level is decreasing.

340
00:18:51,866 --> 00:18:54,133
Start an IV.

341
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,233
Under 85 now.

342
00:18:55,266 --> 00:18:56,600
-Hurry with level one.

343
00:18:56,633 --> 00:18:58,200
-She's on oxygen now.

344
00:18:58,233 --> 00:19:00,100
-Watch for SPO2.

345
00:19:00,133 --> 00:19:01,533
TORI (VOICEOVER)
What's happening?

346
00:19:01,566 --> 00:19:02,533
Am I going to die?

347
00:19:06,066 --> 00:19:07,533
[gasp]

348
00:19:07,566 --> 00:19:09,033
-Natsume.

349
00:19:09,066 --> 00:19:11,033
Natsume.

350
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,033
-Who's there?

351
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,966
Lord Senba?

352
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,066
-I am a weak deity.

353
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:32,500
But as long as someone believes
in me, I will not disappear.

354
00:19:32,533 --> 00:19:35,866
The depth of people's wishes
makes my power stronger.

355
00:19:48,133 --> 00:19:50,566
-It seems we made it
just in the nick of time.

356
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,833
-Yeah.

357
00:19:51,866 --> 00:19:53,266
In time for me, too.

358
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,733
-I heard Lord
Sodemogi got killed.

359
00:20:01,766 --> 00:20:02,433
-Don't worry.

360
00:20:02,466 --> 00:20:04,233
It's according to plan.

361
00:20:04,266 --> 00:20:06,000
But it's disturbing
how well the clan

362
00:20:06,033 --> 00:20:10,100
is faring without their
Supreme Commander leading them.

363
00:20:10,133 --> 00:20:13,033
Rikuo Nura, huh?

364
00:20:13,066 --> 00:20:16,933
-You are the only one fit to
take control of this world.

365
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:20,466
Shall I prove it to them?

366
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:24,633
Give me the order, and I'll
gladly bring you his head.

367
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:27,566
-No, there's no need
to kill him right now.

368
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,566
He's merely a piece
of decoration.

369
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,533
-It is necessary.

370
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:36,366
We must show that damn Nura
clan the vast difference

371
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,466
between Rikuo Nura
and you, Tamazuki.

372
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,233
Come on, Tamazuki.

373
00:20:42,266 --> 00:20:45,833
Let me be your fangs so
I can tear him apart.

374
00:20:45,866 --> 00:20:47,266
-Hmm.

375
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:50,200
[panting]

376
00:21:14,433 --> 00:21:14,900
-Mmm.

377
00:21:18,766 --> 00:21:20,833
-Is it OK for you to
be running like that?

378
00:21:20,866 --> 00:21:21,433
-Yeah.

379
00:21:21,466 --> 00:21:23,433
I feel just fine.

380
00:21:23,466 --> 00:21:26,166
-But it's like there was
nothing ever wrong with you.

381
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,133
It's so strange.

382
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:29,966
-I believe that this
is also connected

383
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,633
to the rash of
Yokai incidents that

384
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,500
have been happening
all over town.

385
00:21:33,533 --> 00:21:34,366
-There's a good
chance that you're

386
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,600
right about that, Kiyotsugu.

387
00:21:35,633 --> 00:21:38,000
-You guys always think
there's Yokai involved.

388
00:21:38,033 --> 00:21:39,133
-Yeah.

389
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:42,133
But thanks, everyone,
for being there for me.

390
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:44,700
-However, I think
the one who really

391
00:21:44,733 --> 00:21:48,533
saved her was the
deity of this shrine.

392
00:21:48,566 --> 00:21:49,033
-Hmm.

393
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:01,033
(VOICEOVER) A gentle
breeze fills the air,

394
00:22:01,066 --> 00:22:04,700
carrying with it
the scent of summer.

395
00:22:08,090 --> 00:23:37,894
[theme music - in japanese]

396
00:23:38,618 --> 00:23:39,652
-Say, Maki.

397
00:23:39,685 --> 00:23:41,585
We've seen quite a
few Yokai, haven't we?

398
00:23:41,618 --> 00:23:42,818
-You are so right.

399
00:23:42,852 --> 00:23:45,285
-So how come Kyotsugu
hasn't seen any yet?

400
00:23:45,318 --> 00:23:46,252
-I don't know.

401
00:23:46,285 --> 00:23:48,152
Maybe the Yokai just
can't stand him.

402
00:23:48,185 --> 00:23:49,885
-Next time.
