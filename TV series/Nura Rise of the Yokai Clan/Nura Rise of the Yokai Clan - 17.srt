1
00:00:09,874 --> 00:00:13,607
NARRATOR: In days of
old, people feared Yokai.

2
00:00:13,641 --> 00:00:16,641
The one who stood at the
helm, and led the night

3
00:00:16,674 --> 00:00:19,274
parade of a hundred
demons was known

4
00:00:19,307 --> 00:00:23,341
as the Supreme
Commander of the Yokai.

5
00:00:23,374 --> 00:00:26,407
They had another name
for him, the Lord

6
00:00:26,441 --> 00:00:31,441
of Pandemonium-- Nurarihyon.

7
00:00:31,474 --> 00:02:00,601
[theme music] had

8
00:02:13,859 --> 00:02:17,225
TAMAZUKI: So Rikuo
Nura appeared.

9
00:02:17,259 --> 00:02:20,259
-Yes, and he's no ordinary brat.

10
00:02:20,292 --> 00:02:23,725
-I didn't expect to
hear you say that.

11
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:25,392
It just makes all
of us coming here

12
00:02:25,425 --> 00:02:29,059
to Ukiyoe Town that much
more worthwhile, however,

13
00:02:29,092 --> 00:02:32,625
he doesn't have a clue that he's
already imprisoned in my trap,

14
00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:37,125
and is being completely
manipulated by me.

15
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:40,025
-I wonder when the stupid
little brat will realize it?

16
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:42,759
-When he finally does,
it'll be way too late.

17
00:02:42,792 --> 00:02:44,525
-I hope that all of
you will continue

18
00:02:44,559 --> 00:02:46,159
to show your support for me.

19
00:02:46,192 --> 00:02:47,459
I'm counting on you.

20
00:02:47,492 --> 00:02:48,725
-Yes, of course.

21
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:51,825
-We will gladly give our
lives to carry out your order.

22
00:02:51,859 --> 00:02:56,159
That will give rise to the
dawn of the Shikoku Yokai.

23
00:03:01,725 --> 00:03:03,992
TSURARA (VOICEOVER): "The
Sublime Spirit Burns Crimson.

24
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:11,192
-Do you really think
that these interlopers

25
00:03:11,225 --> 00:03:14,125
are attempting to
destroy the Nura Clan?

26
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,192
-Our clansmen are being
attacked one after another.

27
00:03:17,225 --> 00:03:19,759
Isn't that the
obvious conclusion?

28
00:03:19,792 --> 00:03:21,159
-No.

29
00:03:21,192 --> 00:03:23,159
Think about it for a moment.

30
00:03:23,192 --> 00:03:24,992
Would the destruction
of the Nura Clan

31
00:03:25,025 --> 00:03:27,459
really benefit
the Shikoku Yokai?

32
00:03:27,492 --> 00:03:28,525
-Hm.

33
00:03:28,559 --> 00:03:30,759
If they seriously
considered their future,

34
00:03:30,792 --> 00:03:32,792
they would want to rule
over us, and increase

35
00:03:32,825 --> 00:03:34,192
their military power.

36
00:03:34,225 --> 00:03:37,225
KARASU: Then what is the true
aim of these Shikoku Yokai?

37
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:37,859
-I don't know.

38
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:42,892
-It's dawn.

39
00:03:50,225 --> 00:03:51,892
-Gyuki is right.

40
00:03:51,925 --> 00:03:54,325
If they intended to
destroy the Nura Clan,

41
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,425
they would have made
an all out attack.

42
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:01,859
The fact that they haven't means
they're after something else.

43
00:04:01,892 --> 00:04:03,625
I have to settle
this before Kana

44
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:05,225
and everyone else
are put in danger.

45
00:04:09,725 --> 00:04:11,125
-That was a really close call.

46
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:12,125
-Yeah.

47
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,825
I'm gonna get that
middle aged broad.

48
00:04:13,859 --> 00:04:16,559
I'll totally pulverize
her next time we meet.

49
00:04:16,592 --> 00:04:19,325
-Well thank goodness master
showed up and saved you.

50
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:20,925
KEJORO: No kidding.

51
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,092
Who would've imagined
that Master Rikuo would

52
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:25,359
come to my rescue.

53
00:04:25,392 --> 00:04:27,359
I was so surprised
when he arrived.

54
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:31,692
I suppose that this means he
does cherish me after all.

55
00:04:31,725 --> 00:04:36,825
He was so handsome and dashing.

56
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:37,459
-Oh.

57
00:04:37,492 --> 00:04:38,592
Sorry about that.

58
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:41,259
Now try not to be quite
so reckless from now on.

59
00:04:41,292 --> 00:04:45,592
You're not quite as
young as you used to be.

60
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,692
[humming]

61
00:04:50,992 --> 00:04:51,392
-Huh?

62
00:05:09,659 --> 00:05:13,925
KIYOTSUGU: Kiyojuji
Paranormal Patrol assemble!

63
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:15,559
Take a look at this!

64
00:05:15,592 --> 00:05:16,559
-What is that?

65
00:05:16,592 --> 00:05:18,159
-A map of Ukiyoe Town?

66
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:20,025
-What do all those
X marks on it mean?

67
00:05:20,059 --> 00:05:21,759
-That's an excellent
question, Shima!

68
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:24,025
What you see here is
a compilation of data

69
00:05:24,059 --> 00:05:27,259
I came up with using my
intelligence network.

70
00:05:27,292 --> 00:05:29,392
It shows all the
shrines in Ukiyoe Town,

71
00:05:29,425 --> 00:05:30,825
including the small
ones that have

72
00:05:30,859 --> 00:05:33,325
been destroyed by
some unknown vandal.

73
00:05:33,359 --> 00:05:34,425
-Huh?

74
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,292
Did you just say they've
all been destroyed?

75
00:05:36,325 --> 00:05:37,425
-Yes.

76
00:05:37,459 --> 00:05:38,992
There's been a rash of
these incidents in town.

77
00:05:45,059 --> 00:05:46,625
-So what about it?

78
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:48,492
KIYOTSUGU: That's a
silly question, Ienaga.

79
00:05:48,525 --> 00:05:51,259
This is undoubtedly
the work of Yokai.

80
00:05:51,292 --> 00:05:52,192
-No.

81
00:05:52,225 --> 00:05:54,459
It's probably a
drunk of something.

82
00:05:54,492 --> 00:05:57,559
-The Kiyojuji Paranormal Patrol
will get to the bottom of this

83
00:05:57,592 --> 00:06:01,125
by finding the Yokai responsible
for this blatant vandalism!

84
00:06:01,159 --> 00:06:01,992
We begin now!

85
00:06:02,025 --> 00:06:04,159
Kiyojuji Patrol, move out!

86
00:06:04,192 --> 00:06:05,292
-Right.

87
00:06:05,325 --> 00:06:05,859
-What?

88
00:06:05,892 --> 00:06:06,392
KIYOTSUGU: OK.

89
00:06:06,425 --> 00:06:07,359
Let's go.

90
00:06:07,392 --> 00:06:08,525
SHIMA:You mean
right this instant?

91
00:06:08,559 --> 00:06:09,992
KIYOTSUGU: Of
course, this instant.

92
00:06:10,025 --> 00:06:10,625
-Wait a minute.

93
00:06:10,659 --> 00:06:11,559
Don't leave here.

94
00:06:11,592 --> 00:06:12,792
It's dangerous outside.

95
00:06:17,525 --> 00:06:19,159
-What'll we do?

96
00:06:19,192 --> 00:06:20,625
-I have to go protect them.

97
00:06:20,659 --> 00:06:21,592
-By yourself?

98
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:22,325
-No.

99
00:06:22,359 --> 00:06:25,125
Sanba Garasu, Aotabo.

100
00:06:25,159 --> 00:06:27,159
-At your service, Master Rikuo.

101
00:06:27,192 --> 00:06:29,925
-I need an escort.

102
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:30,559
-Oh.

103
00:06:30,592 --> 00:06:31,159
Are you going out?

104
00:06:31,192 --> 00:06:31,925
-Yes.

105
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:34,025
For Kiyojuji Patrol work!

106
00:06:34,059 --> 00:06:34,825
-I see.

107
00:06:34,859 --> 00:06:36,492
Please be careful out there.

108
00:06:36,525 --> 00:06:40,459
-Thank you, Mrs. Nura!

109
00:06:40,492 --> 00:06:41,159
-Wait.

110
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:44,425
We're coming with you.

111
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:46,792
-The clan is facing
a serious crisis,

112
00:06:46,825 --> 00:06:49,559
and Rikuo is going
out with his friends?

113
00:06:49,592 --> 00:06:50,292
How irresponsible.

114
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:05,792
-Here to.

115
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:08,492
What exactly is
happening to Ukiyoe Town?

116
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:16,159
-Look, look, look!

117
00:07:16,192 --> 00:07:17,459
-Kiyotsugu?

118
00:07:17,492 --> 00:07:20,325
-This shrine was perfectly
fine yesterday afternoon.

119
00:07:20,359 --> 00:07:22,292
All this damage was
done last night.

120
00:07:22,325 --> 00:07:23,525
-Last night?

121
00:07:23,559 --> 00:07:25,425
-There's a good chance
that Yokai may still

122
00:07:25,459 --> 00:07:28,925
be lurking around here, so
let's split up and search.

123
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:29,792
SAORI: OK.

124
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:30,925
NATSUMI: Let's go that way.

125
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:32,892
SAORI: Mhm, Come with us, Kana.

126
00:07:32,925 --> 00:07:33,592
KANA: OK.

127
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:34,159
KIYOTSUGU: C'mon.

128
00:07:34,192 --> 00:07:35,292
Let's go, Shima.

129
00:07:35,325 --> 00:07:38,159
I'm gonna make sure I
encounter a Yokai today!

130
00:07:38,192 --> 00:07:40,059
-Oikawa.

131
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:44,725
-I suppose there's really
no need to hide from them.

132
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:45,859
-Let's start from here.

133
00:07:45,892 --> 00:07:48,659
-OK.

134
00:07:48,692 --> 00:07:50,525
-The shrine is
starting to crumble.

135
00:07:50,559 --> 00:07:53,425
-And there are no signs
of the local deity.

136
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:54,459
I'd say--

137
00:07:54,492 --> 00:07:56,525
-It's the work of some Yokai.

138
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:57,459
-Wait a minute.

139
00:07:57,492 --> 00:07:58,792
What are they whispering about?

140
00:08:01,825 --> 00:08:04,592
-Look at this cloth.

141
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:05,625
What do you think?

142
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:09,159
-A piece torn from a kimono?

143
00:08:09,192 --> 00:08:12,259
-Are they kissing in
a place like this?

144
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:14,959
Those two have something going?

145
00:08:14,992 --> 00:08:18,125
I can't see from this side.

146
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:21,892
-So do you think that this is
the work of the Shikoku Yokai?

147
00:08:21,925 --> 00:08:22,992
-I'm confused.

148
00:08:23,025 --> 00:08:25,859
I thought that Nura
and Ienaga were dating.

149
00:08:25,892 --> 00:08:26,559
He's two-timing?!

150
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:30,425
-Oh no, master.

151
00:08:30,459 --> 00:08:32,159
What if she heard
what we were saying?

152
00:08:32,192 --> 00:08:34,192
-Wha-- what do we do?

153
00:08:34,225 --> 00:08:37,325
-Why if it isn't Yura.

154
00:08:37,359 --> 00:08:38,159
-Hi, Yura.

155
00:08:38,192 --> 00:08:40,492
Is your injury feeling better?

156
00:08:40,525 --> 00:08:42,659
-Nura.

157
00:08:42,692 --> 00:08:43,459
-Uh-- yes?

158
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,592
-He who runs after two
hares will catch neither.

159
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:49,425
-What?

160
00:08:49,459 --> 00:08:52,759
-Don't underestimate rabbits.

161
00:08:52,792 --> 00:08:53,259
-Uh.

162
00:09:01,059 --> 00:09:02,925
-What's the matter with Yura?

163
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,392
-I don't know.

164
00:09:04,425 --> 00:09:04,892
-Oh.

165
00:09:04,925 --> 00:09:07,192
Um-- here.

166
00:09:07,225 --> 00:09:08,025
-Hm?

167
00:09:08,059 --> 00:09:08,692
Wow!

168
00:09:08,725 --> 00:09:09,925
Excellent job, Nura!

169
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:12,459
You found a clue to
the Yokai who did this!

170
00:09:12,492 --> 00:09:14,625
-I don't if it's a clue or not.

171
00:09:14,659 --> 00:09:16,492
-We'll leave it to my
intelligence network

172
00:09:16,525 --> 00:09:17,692
to find out.

173
00:09:17,725 --> 00:09:20,792
We are going to check
this clue out thoroughly.

174
00:09:20,825 --> 00:09:23,359
[laughter]

175
00:09:29,292 --> 00:09:33,492
NARRATOR: Meanwhile, over
in the Shikoku mountains.

176
00:09:33,525 --> 00:09:35,025
-Something is odd.

177
00:09:35,059 --> 00:09:35,525
-What?

178
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:36,892
Again?

179
00:09:36,925 --> 00:09:39,659
What is it that's bothering
you so much about this place?

180
00:09:39,692 --> 00:09:41,625
I don't sense anything
odd around here at all.

181
00:09:45,225 --> 00:09:47,992
-It stinks.

182
00:09:48,025 --> 00:09:50,392
I've been on guard
here for 200 years,

183
00:09:50,425 --> 00:09:53,825
but I've never smelled
anything like this stench.

184
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:55,525
Wait a minute.

185
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:56,892
It's natto.

186
00:09:56,925 --> 00:10:01,125
There shouldn't be a smell
like this anywhere around here.

187
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:03,059
-This is an odd place after all.

188
00:10:03,092 --> 00:10:05,525
I can't believe they
don't have natto beans.

189
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:08,759
-That's not what I meant when
I said something's odd, Natto.

190
00:10:08,792 --> 00:10:12,392
This area used be much
more dangerous than this.

191
00:10:12,425 --> 00:10:13,092
-It was?

192
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,492
-Outsiders can't pass.

193
00:10:17,525 --> 00:10:19,425
-Ow.

194
00:10:19,459 --> 00:10:21,625
-Get back here you, brat.

195
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:23,559
-Wait for me, Supreme Commander!

196
00:10:26,925 --> 00:10:28,825
-You can't hide from me.

197
00:10:28,859 --> 00:10:36,025
I know this place
much better than you

198
00:10:36,059 --> 00:10:36,992
-Supreme Commander!

199
00:10:53,192 --> 00:10:56,959
-It's been 300 years,
Inugamigyoubu Tanuki.

200
00:10:56,992 --> 00:10:59,259
You've changed quite a bit.

201
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:02,492
-And you also, Supreme
Commander of the Nura Clan.

202
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:08,259
-What is this.

203
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:10,325
There's so many.

204
00:11:10,359 --> 00:11:12,725
-It seems there are
less than before.

205
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:13,292
-Oh.

206
00:11:13,325 --> 00:11:14,492
Is that right?

207
00:11:14,525 --> 00:11:18,625
-Long ago, there
were 108 of these.

208
00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:20,159
-Where are we?

209
00:11:20,192 --> 00:11:23,692
-This is the home of the kingpin
of the Shikoku's Yokai's clans,

210
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:27,892
the headquarters of the 88
Demons of the Shikoku Yamaguchi

211
00:11:27,925 --> 00:11:29,525
Holy Shrine.

212
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:31,592
Isn't that so?

213
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:32,092
-Yes.

214
00:11:34,925 --> 00:11:35,992
-Hey, boss.

215
00:11:36,025 --> 00:11:38,792
Do you really know this
weird old man here?

216
00:11:38,825 --> 00:11:39,825
-Yes, I do.

217
00:11:39,859 --> 00:11:41,925
Now you go and play
with this little child

218
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:43,359
that came with him.

219
00:11:43,392 --> 00:11:44,059
-Oh, ho-ho.

220
00:11:44,092 --> 00:11:45,759
He really stinks too!

221
00:11:45,792 --> 00:11:46,525
-Hey!

222
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:49,759
Wait! you'll get used to it!

223
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,925
-So it's been quite a long time.

224
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:55,025
Sorry, but that's not
a cushion to sit on.

225
00:11:55,059 --> 00:11:56,525
-Huh?

226
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:57,959
Oh.

227
00:11:57,992 --> 00:11:59,392
I beg you pardon.

228
00:11:59,425 --> 00:12:01,192
-There is much to talk about.

229
00:12:01,225 --> 00:12:02,859
But first, sake.

230
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:18,723
SAORI: We walked so much
my legs are swollen.

231
00:12:18,757 --> 00:12:20,623
KANA: I'll make you
a cold compress.

232
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:21,757
Shima, come on.

233
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:22,490
It's your turn.

234
00:12:22,523 --> 00:12:23,090
SHIMA: I know.

235
00:12:23,123 --> 00:12:24,490
I know.

236
00:12:24,523 --> 00:12:27,990
-I'm writing you in search
for news about Yokai.

237
00:12:28,023 --> 00:12:29,857
And now to send.

238
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,123
-Nurika be Ace.

239
00:12:31,157 --> 00:12:31,623
-I doubt it!

240
00:12:35,123 --> 00:12:36,557
-I thought Rikuo would be here.

241
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,423
Isn't he coming?

242
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:38,757
-I wonder what's keeping him?

243
00:12:51,557 --> 00:12:53,257
RIKUO (VOICEOVER): The
shrines in our town

244
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:58,257
are being destroyed, and our
clansmen are being attacked.

245
00:12:58,290 --> 00:12:59,423
Could they all be connected?

246
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:16,757
-Huh?

247
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:22,157
-Thank you for helping me
out of a dangerous situation

248
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:22,657
yesterday.

249
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:27,457
-Any time.

250
00:13:31,357 --> 00:13:32,890
That's it!

251
00:13:32,923 --> 00:13:35,957
Yesterday you were being
attacked by Kagibari Onna,

252
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:38,957
so I rushed over to help you.

253
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:41,357
At that same time, that
shrine was being destroyed.

254
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:46,357
I wonder.

255
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,557
-Master Rikuo?

256
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:48,923
-Thank you, Kejoro.

257
00:13:48,957 --> 00:13:50,923
I know what the Shikoku
Yokai are after.

258
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:55,957
Gather everyone.

259
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:57,523
Listen up, everyone.

260
00:13:57,557 --> 00:13:59,690
Split up and assign a
guard to every shrine

261
00:13:59,723 --> 00:14:01,623
that has not been destroyed yet.

262
00:14:01,657 --> 00:14:03,757
Do not leave your stations.

263
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,790
The enemy may try
something showy,

264
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,723
but that'll just be a diversion.

265
00:14:07,757 --> 00:14:08,923
-A diversion?

266
00:14:08,957 --> 00:14:10,157
-That's right.

267
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,723
They'll do something flashy
to get our attention,

268
00:14:11,757 --> 00:14:13,590
while they carry out
their true purpose

269
00:14:13,623 --> 00:14:16,823
for coming to Ukiyoe Town.

270
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:18,357
-And that would be?

271
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,623
-To attack the local deities.

272
00:14:20,657 --> 00:14:22,723
They're trying to
cleverly undermine

273
00:14:22,757 --> 00:14:24,590
the power of our clan.

274
00:14:24,623 --> 00:14:27,690
Local deities garner the
beliefs and fears of humans,

275
00:14:27,723 --> 00:14:30,490
and thus support the
foundation of the clan.

276
00:14:30,523 --> 00:14:32,357
-If those deities
are eliminated,

277
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:34,523
the people will turn
to the Shikoku Yokai

278
00:14:34,557 --> 00:14:36,957
to appease their
beliefs and fears.

279
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:39,990
-They'll weaken the framework
of the Nura Clan from beneath.

280
00:14:40,023 --> 00:14:41,290
-Not only our clan.

281
00:14:41,323 --> 00:14:44,757
They want control
of the whole town.

282
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:47,257
-We're not going to let
them have their way anymore.

283
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:48,390
I'm counting on you all.

284
00:14:48,423 --> 00:14:48,890
Right.

285
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:57,190
-Master, everyone has
taken their positions.

286
00:14:57,223 --> 00:14:58,523
-That's good.

287
00:14:58,557 --> 00:14:59,890
Now all we do is wait.

288
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:25,423
-Huh?

289
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:27,023
-Do you really think it
was all right to leave

290
00:15:27,057 --> 00:15:30,090
Nura's house like this?

291
00:15:30,123 --> 00:15:31,023
-Shima.

292
00:15:31,057 --> 00:15:31,990
-Yeah?

293
00:15:32,023 --> 00:15:33,823
-It's master's school friends.

294
00:15:33,857 --> 00:15:34,990
-Why are they here?

295
00:15:35,023 --> 00:15:35,923
-Shima.

296
00:15:35,957 --> 00:15:39,023
You saw the map, didn't you?

297
00:15:39,057 --> 00:15:41,057
-What about it?

298
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:43,523
-When you connect
all the shrine ruins,

299
00:15:43,557 --> 00:15:46,223
in the order in which
they were destroyed,

300
00:15:46,257 --> 00:15:49,023
the arrows form of
tightening spiral.

301
00:15:49,057 --> 00:15:51,757
So, in other words, the
next undamaged shrine

302
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:55,323
in the path of the arrows is
bound to be the next target.

303
00:15:55,357 --> 00:15:58,257
And this is that shrine!

304
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,557
Mark my words.

305
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:02,457
Today is the day that I will
finally meet with a Yokai!

306
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:09,657
[shriek]

307
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:12,590
-So Kagibari Onna
went into Yokai Alley.

308
00:16:12,623 --> 00:16:15,923
-Yes., but she ran
away pretty quickly.

309
00:16:15,957 --> 00:16:18,257
-The enemy has begun
its diversions,

310
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:21,390
which means that a shrine
somewhere will soon be--

311
00:16:21,423 --> 00:16:25,242
-Actually, master, we
may have a big problem.

312
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:26,575
Aotabo just called.

313
00:16:26,609 --> 00:16:27,209
-Huh?

314
00:16:27,242 --> 00:16:28,542
What happened?

315
00:16:28,575 --> 00:16:30,309
Kiyotsugu and Shima
left the mansion

316
00:16:30,342 --> 00:16:32,709
despite all the
warnings I gave them?

317
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:33,742
-I see.

318
00:16:33,775 --> 00:16:36,142
Looks like I figured
it all out, Shima.

319
00:16:36,175 --> 00:16:38,309
I received data
about that torn cloth

320
00:16:38,342 --> 00:16:41,609
from a Yokai professor
who lives over in Shikoku.

321
00:16:41,642 --> 00:16:42,475
-Shikoku?

322
00:16:42,509 --> 00:16:42,975
-Yes.

323
00:16:43,009 --> 00:16:43,942
Shikoku!

324
00:16:43,975 --> 00:16:45,409
There's a Yokai that
comes from there

325
00:16:45,442 --> 00:16:48,009
who is known for eating
kimonos and clothing.

326
00:16:48,042 --> 00:16:49,509
This is him!

327
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:50,942
-Huh?

328
00:16:50,975 --> 00:16:52,509
-Lord Sodemogi.

329
00:16:52,542 --> 00:16:55,742
This Yokai specializes
in killing local deities.

330
00:16:55,775 --> 00:16:59,109
You see, every town has local
deities, supernatural beings

331
00:16:59,142 --> 00:17:01,309
that watch over
the land, and live

332
00:17:01,342 --> 00:17:03,442
in these kinds of
hollowed shrines.

333
00:17:03,475 --> 00:17:07,109
They're also known
as native deities.

334
00:17:07,142 --> 00:17:11,442
-This one has a strange
and unusual appearance.

335
00:17:11,475 --> 00:17:14,709
He must be the local
deity of this shrine.

336
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:19,042
-It says here that Lord Sodemogi
usually appears from behind,

337
00:17:19,075 --> 00:17:21,642
then he reaches out
and pulls your sleeve.

338
00:17:21,675 --> 00:17:23,142
If you turn and
look at his face,

339
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:25,175
you immediately become cursed!

340
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:27,675
If you don't wanna be
cursed, be docile, and let

341
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:28,775
him have the sleeve.

342
00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:31,442
You're not supposed to resist.

343
00:17:31,475 --> 00:17:32,809
-No way!

344
00:17:32,842 --> 00:17:35,575
-What are those two doing?

345
00:17:35,609 --> 00:17:37,975
-Hey, Shima, don't
pull at me like that.

346
00:17:38,009 --> 00:17:39,975
I can't I type when you do that.

347
00:17:40,009 --> 00:17:42,942
-Kiyotsugu, behind you.

348
00:17:42,975 --> 00:17:43,475
-Behind me?

349
00:17:43,509 --> 00:17:44,109
-No!

350
00:17:44,142 --> 00:17:45,242
Don't look at it!

351
00:17:45,275 --> 00:17:46,842
-Calm down, will you?

352
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:48,142
Don't bother me.

353
00:17:48,175 --> 00:17:49,142
Shima, please!

354
00:17:49,175 --> 00:17:50,242
SHIMA (VOICEOVER): Oh, oh.

355
00:17:50,275 --> 00:17:51,075
What do I do?

356
00:17:51,109 --> 00:17:52,575
If I don't do something fast.

357
00:17:52,609 --> 00:17:55,309
Kiyotsugu will be cursed!

358
00:17:55,342 --> 00:17:56,309
Of course.

359
00:17:56,342 --> 00:17:57,509
I can use this.

360
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:05,942
The best of Japan's
under 14 soccer players.

361
00:18:05,975 --> 00:18:07,209
-You're so annoying!

362
00:18:11,542 --> 00:18:14,475
-This is my world
cup, so take that.

363
00:18:14,509 --> 00:18:15,442
-You're bothering me.

364
00:18:18,775 --> 00:18:20,742
-Kiyotsugu, are you all right?

365
00:18:20,775 --> 00:18:22,709
-What's the big idea Shima?

366
00:18:22,742 --> 00:18:24,975
-A Yokai, there was
a Yokai behind you.

367
00:18:25,009 --> 00:18:26,742
-What?

368
00:18:26,775 --> 00:18:28,542
-Those two destroyed the shrine.

369
00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:30,442
-So this whole time
is was their doing?

370
00:18:30,475 --> 00:18:31,709
-I doubt that.

371
00:18:31,742 --> 00:18:32,975
Let's keep watch a bit longer.

372
00:18:39,109 --> 00:18:39,575
-Wait.

373
00:18:39,609 --> 00:18:40,475
Isn't that?

374
00:18:40,509 --> 00:18:42,609
-I'm sure of it.

375
00:18:42,642 --> 00:18:44,509
[giggling]

376
00:18:44,542 --> 00:18:46,175
-Stop!

377
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:46,742
-Where?

378
00:18:46,775 --> 00:18:48,309
Where did it go?

379
00:18:48,342 --> 00:18:50,542
-I think it went
that way over there.

380
00:18:50,575 --> 00:18:52,375
-Looks like they're
both all right.

381
00:18:52,409 --> 00:18:54,242
Tsurara, get them out of here.

382
00:18:54,275 --> 00:18:54,809
-Right.

383
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:55,375
Leave it to me.

384
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:03,942
-Damn it.

385
00:19:03,975 --> 00:19:05,009
Is this the Yokai's doing too?

386
00:19:09,775 --> 00:19:10,809
[giggling]

387
00:19:10,842 --> 00:19:13,142
-So you're the one
who's responsible!

388
00:19:13,175 --> 00:19:14,975
-You won't get away with it.

389
00:19:15,009 --> 00:19:16,209
-What are you waiting for?

390
00:19:16,242 --> 00:19:17,409
An engraved invitation?

391
00:19:17,442 --> 00:19:18,909
Get out here and
help me already!

392
00:19:24,542 --> 00:19:27,109
You can take over now.

393
00:19:27,142 --> 00:19:31,109
-You won't pass, because
protecting Lord Sodemogi--

394
00:19:31,142 --> 00:19:33,542
-Is our mission.

395
00:19:33,575 --> 00:19:34,442
-Master, get away!

396
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:39,042
-Aotabo!

397
00:19:39,075 --> 00:19:42,242
-Leave this overgrown oaf to me.

398
00:19:42,275 --> 00:19:44,175
-You're the crows
from the other day.

399
00:19:44,209 --> 00:19:45,142
-You're surrounded.

400
00:19:45,175 --> 00:19:46,175
Give up.

401
00:19:46,209 --> 00:19:48,809
-I, Inuhoo will
neither run, nor hide.

402
00:19:48,842 --> 00:19:49,375
-C'mon.

403
00:19:49,409 --> 00:19:50,342
Let's get him.

404
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,542
-I'll make you
regret those words.

405
00:19:52,575 --> 00:19:53,909
-Stop acting brave.

406
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:55,242
[chuckling]

407
00:19:55,275 --> 00:19:57,409
-My flames are invincible.

408
00:19:57,442 --> 00:20:00,442
They will devour any
who dares to oppose me.

409
00:20:00,475 --> 00:20:03,575
Turn to ashes and
scatter in the wind!

410
00:20:03,609 --> 00:20:05,275
-You know who
you're dealing with?

411
00:20:05,309 --> 00:20:09,075
I am Tearai-oni, the strongest
Yokai in all of Shikoku.

412
00:20:09,109 --> 00:20:11,609
-Pretty impressive, but
you're not the only one

413
00:20:11,642 --> 00:20:13,242
with brute strength around here.

414
00:20:13,275 --> 00:20:14,942
Just in case you
don't know, the name's

415
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:18,442
Aotabo, the apostate monk
who wears an iron blue robe.

416
00:20:22,909 --> 00:20:23,375
-Huh?

417
00:20:26,342 --> 00:20:27,775
Uh-- mom?

418
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:28,742
MRS. NURA: What is it?

419
00:20:28,775 --> 00:20:29,242
I'm busy.

420
00:20:34,675 --> 00:20:36,109
[laughter]

421
00:20:36,142 --> 00:20:38,275
-You expect to
beat me in the sky?

422
00:20:38,309 --> 00:20:40,675
Not in a million years!

423
00:20:40,709 --> 00:20:41,642
-Die!

424
00:20:41,675 --> 00:20:43,642
-Look out!

425
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:45,109
[laughter]

426
00:20:45,142 --> 00:20:48,275
-You won't even
make good yakitori!

427
00:20:48,309 --> 00:20:50,342
-That bird's tougher
than I thought.

428
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,309
-This guy has
absolute confidence

429
00:20:52,342 --> 00:20:53,975
in the power of his fire.

430
00:20:54,009 --> 00:20:55,642
-He doesn't believe
for a minute that he

431
00:20:55,675 --> 00:20:58,409
can be defeated by us in battle.

432
00:20:58,442 --> 00:20:59,609
-Yes.

433
00:20:59,642 --> 00:21:02,209
And that blatant arrogance
will be his downfall.

434
00:21:02,242 --> 00:21:04,909
Let's go.

435
00:21:04,942 --> 00:21:07,942
-And now for the final blow!

436
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:11,542
Die at the hands of Inuhoo, the
most skillful of the Shikoku

437
00:21:11,575 --> 00:21:12,375
Yokai.

438
00:21:12,409 --> 00:21:14,475
I Consider yourselves blessed!

439
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:28,309
What?!

440
00:21:28,342 --> 00:21:31,975
How could I, the
great Inuhoo burn?

441
00:21:32,009 --> 00:21:35,375
Done in by a bunch
of mere crows?

442
00:21:35,409 --> 00:21:38,409
-You were burned by your
own ego and arrogance.

443
00:21:38,442 --> 00:21:41,175
-Hoo the Firebird is
too good a name for you.

444
00:21:41,209 --> 00:21:44,209
-After all, you're just a
dog, not even good yakitori.

445
00:21:49,442 --> 00:21:50,809
-Time to go.

446
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:54,509
We'll settle out
little fight next time.

447
00:21:54,542 --> 00:21:55,109
-They escaped.

448
00:22:01,042 --> 00:22:04,463

Kejoro, you're

452
00:23:37,383 --> 00:23:38,683
wearing a schoolgirl's uniform?

it so I can guard master.

00:23:40,983 --> 00:23:42,083
how do I look?

pretty good, in a way.
