NARRATOR: In days of
old, people feared Yokai.

The one who stood at the
helm, and led the night

00:00:16,659 --> 00:00:20,892
parade of a hundred demons was
known as the Supreme Commander

the Yokai.

00:00:23,292 --> 00:00:26,425
They had another name
for him, the Lord

00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:25,133
-Forgive me for the other day.

10
00:02:25,167 --> 00:02:27,600
I thought I'd come over
here to officially offer you

11
00:02:27,633 --> 00:02:31,833
my greetings, but
apparently Inugami

12
00:02:31,867 --> 00:02:34,167
has been kind enough to
do that for us already.

13

Let me introduce myself.

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,867
I am the leader of the
88 demons of Shikoku,

15
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,833
and the son of the
Kingpin of the 808 Tanuki.

I am Inugamigyoubu

00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,667
-So why are you doing all this?

TAMAZUKI: Have you've
forgotten already?

20
00:03:01,533 --> 00:03:05,600
I'm going to gather more fear in
this town than you ever could,

21
00:03:05,633 --> 00:03:08,900
and take over this place.

22
00:03:08,933 --> 00:03:11,400
I'm going to make you
stand behind my night

-So it was you!?

25
00:03:16,133 --> 00:03:19,333
You killed my old man!

-Killed who?

27
00:03:24,867 --> 00:03:29,367

-I see.

29
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:35,100
You're the heir of that weak
and feeble Hihi Clan leader.

-You are dead!

-Haa!

-Oh no.

34
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,900
We must stop the
fire from spreading.

-The next time we meet it'll
be far worse than this was.

You want to invite your human
friends to come here again?

43
00:04:44,633 --> 00:04:47,300
I think it'd be safer if we
gathered them all in one place.

-But Master Rikuo, why bring
them here to the main house?

45
00:04:50,933 --> 00:04:53,067
-Because this is
the safest place.

never allow something like this

-All right.

is going to make it.

-Dunno.

She's still recovering
from those burns.

-Yeah.

saw her all bandaged up.

gonna go ask her later.

research right now,

bad as it could have been.

really nothing unusual about it.

-You're wrong.

we're gonna find

while Lord Gyuki is staying

167
00:09:45,633 --> 00:09:47,600
with the Nura
Clan's main family--

168
00:09:47,633 --> 00:09:48,500
-Yeah.

169
00:09:48,533 --> 00:09:51,167
Lord Gyuki will be very pleased.

170
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,067
But more importantly--

171
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:53,600
-Yes.

172
00:09:53,633 --> 00:09:54,433
I know.

173
00:09:54,467 --> 00:09:58,167
It'll be payback for yesterday.

174
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,233
-Hey, mom.

175
00:09:59,267 --> 00:10:00,233
My friends are here!

176
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,267
-Oh. welcome.

177
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,000
Please make yourselves at home.

178
00:10:06,033 --> 00:10:07,600
-Thank you very much, ma'am.

179
00:10:07,633 --> 00:10:09,700
I noticed your gate
was being repaired.

180
00:10:09,733 --> 00:10:10,267
-Yeah.

181
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,233
That's right.

182
00:10:11,267 --> 00:10:12,833
We're fixing up
the main house too.

183
00:10:12,867 --> 00:10:17,400
It's very old, and it's really
starting to show its age.

184
00:10:17,433 --> 00:10:21,333
-Mrs. Nura, I'm sorry we came
over at a time like this.

185
00:10:21,367 --> 00:10:22,600
-It's no problem.

186
00:10:22,633 --> 00:10:24,567
You're always welcome to
come here to our home,

187
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,100
and stay as much as you want.

188
00:10:26,133 --> 00:10:30,733
-Um-- Mrs. Nura, is
Oikawa here already?

189
00:10:30,767 --> 00:10:31,867
-Huh?

190
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:35,200
Oh, Yuki On-- I mean,
Tsurara Oikawa, right?

191
00:10:35,233 --> 00:10:35,867
Yes.

192
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,333
She's already here.

193
00:10:37,367 --> 00:10:38,433
-Fantastic!

194
00:10:38,467 --> 00:10:40,167
-You guys can head
on over to my room.

195
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,200
I'll meet you there.

196
00:10:41,233 --> 00:10:42,000
See you.

197
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,567
-What happened here?

198
00:11:12,233 --> 00:11:14,200
This is still fresh.

199
00:11:14,233 --> 00:11:15,500
It was destroyed just recently.

200
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:22,100
Question is how come?

201
00:11:22,133 --> 00:11:22,600
-What?

202
00:11:22,633 --> 00:11:24,000
Bodyguard?

203
00:11:24,033 --> 00:11:27,467
You want me to sit around, and
guard that L-O-V-E girl and her

204
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,000
ridiculous human friends?

205
00:11:29,033 --> 00:11:32,967
-Yuki Onna, can you please
stop saying L-O-V-E like that

206
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,300
already?

207
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:37,600
Anyway, I think they'll be
safer staying here at the house,

208
00:11:37,633 --> 00:11:40,867
just in case
something bad happens.

209
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,567
-Is that an order master?

210
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,367
-Yes.

211
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,900
It's an order

212
00:11:45,933 --> 00:11:46,500
-I understand.

213
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,133
-I'm counting on you.

214
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,533
-This guy's a little weakling.

215
00:12:19,567 --> 00:12:21,433
-Mezumaru, don't kill him yet.

216
00:12:21,467 --> 00:12:25,900
We'll just capture him, and
pump him for information first.

217
00:12:25,933 --> 00:12:30,167
-And so due to the renovations
being done on the house,

218
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,167
the Yokai expedition
is canceled.

219
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,133
-What do you mean?

220
00:12:35,167 --> 00:12:36,800
That's not what
you promised, Nura!

221
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,767
Look at all this
equipment I brought!

222
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,733
We would have been able
to find Yokai around

223
00:12:40,767 --> 00:12:42,633
here this time for sure!

224
00:12:42,667 --> 00:12:43,200
-Oh.

225
00:12:43,233 --> 00:12:44,467
But you see--

226
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,900
-Nura, you gotta admit.

227
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:47,300
Kiyotsugu is right.

228
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,967
What's the point of
coming to your place

229
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,700
if we can't do an expedition?

230
00:12:50,733 --> 00:12:51,200
-Oh.

231
00:12:51,233 --> 00:12:51,767
Good.

232
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,700
You all came.

233
00:12:52,733 --> 00:12:54,167
-Hi, Oikawa.

234
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,000
-There are a lot of
things to do around here

235
00:12:56,033 --> 00:12:57,767
besides an expedition, you know.

236
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,667
-You're absolutely
right, Oikawa.

237
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,267
Kiyotsugu, aren't
there other things

238
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,033
we can do besides finding Yokai?

239
00:13:03,067 --> 00:13:03,633
KIYOTSUGU: No!

240
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:18,699
-The Nura Clan is probably in
an uproar right around now.

241
00:13:18,733 --> 00:13:23,266
It's rather unfortunate that
we are not there to witness it.

242
00:13:23,299 --> 00:13:26,866
-And they haven't caught on to
Lord Sodemogi's activity yet?

243
00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:28,166
-No.

244
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:31,233
But they will all find out
what he's doing in due time.

245
00:13:31,266 --> 00:13:34,033
But by then-- well--

246
00:13:34,066 --> 00:13:36,399
-It will be too
late to do anything.

247
00:13:36,433 --> 00:13:37,933
-Exactly.

248
00:13:37,966 --> 00:13:40,066
-Pretty roundabout
way of doing it.

249
00:13:40,099 --> 00:13:43,266
Why waste our time when I
could just go kill them myself?

250
00:13:43,299 --> 00:13:45,133
-Inugami, don't you worry.

251
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:47,999
You and I will have
our turns in due time.

252
00:13:48,033 --> 00:13:49,266
You shouldn't be too hasty.

253
00:13:56,633 --> 00:13:59,033
-I just can't wait to
go on a rampage again.

254
00:14:10,699 --> 00:14:12,766
-Lord Hitotsume, please wait.

255
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:13,833
We beg you.

256
00:14:13,866 --> 00:14:16,566
Just try and be patient.

257
00:14:16,599 --> 00:14:20,333
-This is the clan's main house,
the headquarters of the Nura

258
00:14:20,366 --> 00:14:24,066
Clan which leads 72 Yokai
families with over 10,000

259
00:14:24,099 --> 00:14:25,399
members.

260
00:14:25,433 --> 00:14:27,999
And you're telling me that
I, Lord Hitotsume, a top clan

261
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:31,033
official, can not walk
freely through its halls?

262
00:14:31,066 --> 00:14:32,366
What insolence!

263
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,099
-If you go out now,
master's-- or rather the Third

264
00:14:36,133 --> 00:14:38,933
Heir's current efforts
will be all but wasted.

265
00:14:38,966 --> 00:14:39,933
-Silence!

266
00:14:39,966 --> 00:14:41,233
Out of my way!

267
00:14:41,266 --> 00:14:43,166
-Wait, Hitotsume.

268
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,466
-What, Daruma?

269
00:14:44,499 --> 00:14:46,699
Are you siding with
these petty greenhorns?

270
00:14:46,733 --> 00:14:48,233
-Calm down.

271
00:14:48,266 --> 00:14:51,699
I am just as upset over
this incident as you are.

272
00:14:51,733 --> 00:14:56,199
However, in the untimely absence
of the Supreme Commander,

273
00:14:56,233 --> 00:15:00,199
we have received an open
challenge from the Shikoku 808

274
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:03,899
Tanuki, so it behooves us
to stand united, and support

275
00:15:03,933 --> 00:15:06,866
the wishes of Master
Rikuo, the Third Heir.

276
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:09,066
HITOTSUME: So you expect
me to put up with this?

277
00:15:09,099 --> 00:15:10,066
DARUMA: Yes.

278
00:15:10,099 --> 00:15:12,133
The Nura Clan's
existence is at stake.

279
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:13,466
Please bear with it, Hitotsume.

280
00:15:23,633 --> 00:15:25,099
-Haa!

281
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:27,366
How did a weak and
puny Yokai like you

282
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:29,099
manage to become one
of the Seven Phantom

283
00:15:29,133 --> 00:15:30,799
Travelers of Shikoku?

284
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,733
-If you talk, we'll
spare your life.

285
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:34,466
Now tell me all about
your little group

286
00:15:34,499 --> 00:15:36,099
and what their plans are.

287
00:15:36,133 --> 00:15:36,599
-Damn!

288
00:15:42,533 --> 00:15:50,699
[whimpering]

289
00:15:50,733 --> 00:15:51,633
-Yummy.

290
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:52,899
-I can't believe
that you actually

291
00:15:52,933 --> 00:15:54,966
made this from
scratch, Mrs. Nura.

292
00:15:54,999 --> 00:15:55,533
-I'll say.

293
00:15:55,566 --> 00:15:56,633
This is great!

294
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:57,933
This cake is wonderful.

295
00:15:57,966 --> 00:16:00,666
It rivals any cake made by
a pastry chef of the finest

296
00:16:00,699 --> 00:16:01,166
restaurant!

297
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:08,266
-Excuse me.

298
00:16:08,299 --> 00:16:09,533
I should tend to the laundry.

299
00:16:09,566 --> 00:16:09,966
-Oh.

300
00:16:09,999 --> 00:16:10,533
Here.

301
00:16:10,566 --> 00:16:10,999
Let me help you.

302
00:16:15,066 --> 00:16:16,799
-Kana, can you get those?

303
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:17,533
-Sure thing.

304
00:16:17,566 --> 00:16:18,166
-Hey.

305
00:16:18,199 --> 00:16:18,999
Look at those two.

306
00:16:19,033 --> 00:16:20,299
They seem like a mother--

307
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:22,233
-And her close
daughter-in-law, right?

308
00:16:35,033 --> 00:16:37,933
[chuckling]

309
00:16:37,966 --> 00:16:39,366
-Why are you laughing?

310
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:42,433
Did giving up make you
crazy or something?

311
00:16:42,466 --> 00:16:45,899
-Earlier you asked me
how it was that I became

312
00:16:45,933 --> 00:16:50,499
a member of the Seven
Phantom Travelers of Shikoku.

313
00:16:50,533 --> 00:16:53,033
My name is Gangi Kozo.

314
00:16:57,999 --> 00:16:58,733
-Oh, man.

315
00:16:58,766 --> 00:17:00,299
What the hell is going on?

316
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:00,999
-Damn it.

317
00:17:01,033 --> 00:17:01,933
This isn't good at all.

318
00:17:01,966 --> 00:17:04,166
I've heard of the
name Gangi Kozo.

319
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:08,699
[laughter]

320
00:17:08,733 --> 00:17:10,666
[screaming]

321
00:17:10,699 --> 00:17:14,166
-Gozumaru, you didn't tell
me this was gonna happen.

322
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,399
-Gangi Kozo is a Yokai
that manipulates water.

323
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:21,733
-Well, why didn't
you say so sooner?

324
00:17:39,366 --> 00:17:41,799
[screaming]

325
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:48,299
-Not Natto Kozo again!

326
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:49,599
GIRL: What is with you?

327
00:17:49,633 --> 00:17:50,699
You always get him, right?

328
00:17:50,733 --> 00:17:52,266
-It's uncanny, you know?

329
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:56,666
-I'm going to the bathroom.

330
00:17:56,699 --> 00:17:58,199
-Nura, come right back.

331
00:17:58,233 --> 00:18:00,233
We're just now getting
to the fun part.

332
00:18:00,266 --> 00:18:00,733
-OK.

333
00:18:07,699 --> 00:18:08,866
All right then.

334
00:18:08,899 --> 00:18:10,433
I'm gonna go too.

335
00:18:10,466 --> 00:18:12,866
-Sorry for all the
trouble, Third Heir.

336
00:18:16,899 --> 00:18:17,866
KIYOTSUGU: All right.

337
00:18:17,899 --> 00:18:19,099
Bring it on!

338
00:18:19,133 --> 00:18:19,933
-OK, Kiyotsugu.

339
00:18:33,066 --> 00:18:34,099
[chuckling]

340
00:18:34,133 --> 00:18:37,933
-As long as I have
water, I'm in charge.

341
00:18:37,966 --> 00:18:39,133
Huh?

342
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:39,633
Who's there?

343
00:18:42,733 --> 00:18:44,566
-Kappa?

344
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:46,566
Kappa, are you here?

345
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:48,233
Kappa?

346
00:18:48,266 --> 00:18:49,633
Hey, where is Kappa?

347
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:50,566
-Kappa?

348
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:52,633
-Is that what's on my card?

349
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:53,666
-Mesumaru, you idiot.

350
00:18:56,766 --> 00:18:57,433
-Agh!

351
00:18:57,466 --> 00:19:00,233
It's Natto Kozo, again!

352
00:19:00,266 --> 00:19:02,099
-Hey, we need to talk to you.

353
00:19:02,133 --> 00:19:03,699
Aren't you in there, Kappa?

354
00:19:03,733 --> 00:19:06,366
-Where is he when we need him?

355
00:19:06,399 --> 00:19:07,733
-Hey you.

356
00:19:07,766 --> 00:19:10,866
Are you scheming to create
a panic in Ukioe town

357
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:14,099
by destroying the water
purification plant?

358
00:19:14,133 --> 00:19:14,899
-Eh.

359
00:19:14,933 --> 00:19:18,233
A Kappa, eh?

360
00:19:18,266 --> 00:19:19,966
-I've got to hand
it to you, Kappa.

361
00:19:19,999 --> 00:19:23,966
He appeared, just like
you said he would.

362
00:19:23,999 --> 00:19:25,266
Now listen up.

363
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:28,033
Don't destroy the
purification plant.

364
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:31,766
it'll just be a hassle
later, but other

365
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:34,766
than that anything goes, OK?

366
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,999
-Well, that's a pretty
tall order, Third Heir.

367
00:19:39,033 --> 00:19:41,899
But I'll do what I can.

368
00:19:41,933 --> 00:19:42,433
-So cocky.

369
00:19:54,533 --> 00:19:55,966
-What is that?

370
00:19:55,999 --> 00:19:57,966
So much Yokai aura.

371
00:19:57,999 --> 00:19:58,966
Wha?

372
00:19:58,999 --> 00:19:59,966
Huh?

373
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:00,966
It's him!

374
00:20:20,933 --> 00:20:22,133
-Damn!

375
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:24,033
-If a water Yokai escapes
to the sky, it's over.

376
00:20:30,466 --> 00:20:32,399
-Hm?

377
00:20:32,433 --> 00:20:33,133
What a pain.

378
00:20:48,233 --> 00:20:51,333
I can't believe you disrupted
a really good fight.

379
00:20:51,366 --> 00:20:54,999
You Shkoku Yokai have
no sense of honor.

380
00:20:55,033 --> 00:20:57,933
-This is a trifling matter
before an important event.

381
00:20:57,966 --> 00:20:59,699
We're getting out of here.

382
00:20:59,733 --> 00:21:01,266
-Thanks, Inuhoo.

383
00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:02,933
I owe you one.

384
00:21:02,966 --> 00:21:03,899
-Hey.

385
00:21:03,933 --> 00:21:05,566
We're not done here
yet, Gangi Kozo.

386
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:07,433
Are you just gonna run off now?

387
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:09,366
-Don't you worry, Kappa.

388
00:21:09,399 --> 00:21:13,966
When the time comes, we'll
settle this once and for all.

389
00:21:13,999 --> 00:21:16,099
-We have no choice.

390
00:21:16,133 --> 00:21:20,266
Shall we head back
home too, Third Heir?

391
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:21,833
-I guess so.

392
00:21:21,866 --> 00:21:23,466
There are people
waiting for me anyway.

393
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:39,299
-Yeah.

394
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:40,299
I think so.

395
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:41,233
-Sorry.

396
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:43,499
-Man. what took
you so long, Nura?

397
00:21:43,533 --> 00:21:47,766
-Oh-- uh-- my mom asked
me to go on an errand.

398
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:48,399
-Wow.

399
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:50,566
That looks yummy!

war between the Nura Clan

403
00:23:34,867 --> 00:23:36,601
-Hey Yura, where do
you do your laundry?

404
00:23:36,634 --> 00:23:38,349
-I got to the laundromat?

405
00:23:38,382 --> 00:23:38,882
Why?

406
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:40,082
Do I smell?

407
00:23:40,116 --> 00:23:40,616
-No.

408
00:23:40,649 --> 00:23:41,482
Not at all.

409
00:23:41,516 --> 00:23:42,682
-You're gonna do
my laundry for me?

410
00:23:42,716 --> 00:23:43,882
-I never said that.
