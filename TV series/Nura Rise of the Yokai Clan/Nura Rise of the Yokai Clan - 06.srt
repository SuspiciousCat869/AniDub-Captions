1
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:14,100
NARRATOR: In days of
old, people feared Yokai.

2
00:00:14,133 --> 00:00:17,466
The one who stood at the helm
and lead the Night Parade

3
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:22,418
to 100 Demons was known as the
supreme commander of the Yokai.

4
00:00:23,933 --> 00:00:27,000
They had another name
for him, the Lord

5
00:00:27,033 --> 00:00:28,800
of Pandemonium, Nurarihyon.

6
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:37,400
[theme music]

7
00:02:05,133 --> 00:02:08,699
A Yokai that attacks and
devours lost travelers

8
00:02:08,733 --> 00:02:12,499
lives up here on this mountain.

9
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:15,433
Its original name was Mt.

10
00:02:15,466 --> 00:02:17,353
Nejireme.

11
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:23,166
NARRATOR: A beautiful mountain
where plum blossoms dance,

12
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:27,102
but it is actually
home to menacing Yokai.

13
00:02:27,102 --> 00:02:28,202
-The Yokai who lives on Mt.

14
00:02:28,236 --> 00:02:30,636
Nejireme is him.

15
00:02:30,669 --> 00:02:31,136
It's Gyuki.

16
00:02:34,136 --> 00:02:35,969
NARRATOR: Was it a trap,
or sheer coincidence

17
00:02:36,002 --> 00:02:39,236
that they had wandered onto
the territory of Gyuki,

18
00:02:39,269 --> 00:02:41,936
an officer of the Nura clan?

19
00:02:41,969 --> 00:02:45,002
An ominous wind blows
across the eerie slopes

20
00:02:45,036 --> 00:02:48,636
of the evil mountain.

21
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:51,369
GIRL (VOICEOVER): A Trap Is
Set On The Evil Mountain.

22
00:02:55,602 --> 00:02:58,536
GIRL: Hey, are you
sure it's safe up here?

23
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:01,002
GIRL: I don't know, but
one thing is certain.

24
00:03:01,036 --> 00:03:02,702
It's no ordinary mountain.

25
00:03:02,736 --> 00:03:03,702
BOY: Are you serious?

26
00:03:03,736 --> 00:03:04,636
-It's creepy!

27
00:03:04,669 --> 00:03:06,436
-I wanna go home!

28
00:03:06,469 --> 00:03:07,369
[laughter]

29
00:03:07,402 --> 00:03:08,569
-Aw, come on.

30
00:03:08,602 --> 00:03:10,136
Why are you guys so freaked out?

31
00:03:10,169 --> 00:03:13,269
It's finally starting to
feel like a real Yokai tour!

32
00:03:13,302 --> 00:03:14,469
-But Kiyotsugu--

33
00:03:14,502 --> 00:03:16,436
-A huge claw like that
would kill us all.

34
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:19,602
-Yeah, and we'd all be devoured!

35
00:03:19,636 --> 00:03:20,769
-Calm down, you two.

36
00:03:20,802 --> 00:03:21,669
All right?

37
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,802
-But we're scared!

38
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:27,469
-The Gyuki clan, the most
militant faction of our clan.

39
00:03:27,502 --> 00:03:29,869
There's a chance they
may attack the master

40
00:03:29,902 --> 00:03:32,036
without knowing who he is.

41
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:34,369
After all, he's still
in his day form.

42
00:03:34,402 --> 00:03:38,269
Without Ao here, things
could get really ugly.

43
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:42,302
If it does, I must
protect master.

44
00:03:42,336 --> 00:03:45,602
-Oikawa is staring
at Rikuo agian.

45
00:03:45,636 --> 00:03:48,636
Kyotsugu, I think Maki and
Torii are absolutely right.

46
00:03:48,669 --> 00:03:50,636
We should turn around
right now and go home.

47
00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:53,136
-Now, let's get out of here!

48
00:03:53,169 --> 00:03:55,036
-Hey, hold on!

49
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:56,502
Even if we leave
the mountain now,

50
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:58,336
there won't be
any buses running.

51
00:03:58,369 --> 00:03:59,536
-Aw.

52
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:01,369
-There's an exclusive
Japanese inn just up ahead

53
00:04:01,402 --> 00:04:04,136
that Professor Adashibara
reserved for us.

54
00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:06,902
A relaxing hot spring and a
delicious multi course meal

55
00:04:06,936 --> 00:04:08,169
await us there!

56
00:04:08,202 --> 00:04:10,436
Naturally, all costs will
be covered by yours truly,

57
00:04:10,469 --> 00:04:11,402
all right?

58
00:04:11,436 --> 00:04:13,169
-Hot spring?

59
00:04:13,202 --> 00:04:15,036
-A multi course meal?

60
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:16,502
-For free?

61
00:04:16,536 --> 00:04:17,536
That's so cool!

62
00:04:17,569 --> 00:04:18,869
-No, listen!

63
00:04:18,902 --> 00:04:20,436
It's better we all go home!

64
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:22,669
[laughter]

65
00:04:22,702 --> 00:04:26,269
-The story of Gyuki is no
more than a simple legend,

66
00:04:26,302 --> 00:04:29,802
and those big claws you all
saw were probably fake, anyway.

67
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:30,802
-Yes, but--

68
00:04:30,836 --> 00:04:32,336
-Besides, the inn
is fully equipped

69
00:04:32,369 --> 00:04:34,602
with a security
system against Yokai.

70
00:04:34,636 --> 00:04:37,136
There's nothing to
be worried about.

71
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:38,269
-Security?

72
00:04:38,302 --> 00:04:38,969
Against Yokai?

73
00:04:39,002 --> 00:04:40,202
-It's has not only that.

74
00:04:40,236 --> 00:04:42,236
If, by chance, we are
attacked while we're there,

75
00:04:42,269 --> 00:04:44,602
we have Yura Keikain,
our very own Onmioji,

76
00:04:44,636 --> 00:04:46,169
to step in and protect us.

77
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:47,469
Isn't that right?

78
00:04:47,502 --> 00:04:48,336
-Yeah.

79
00:04:48,369 --> 00:04:49,769
-Hey, you're right!

80
00:04:49,802 --> 00:04:52,669
-I will redeem my
honor as Onmyoji.

81
00:04:52,702 --> 00:04:56,636
Better separate my Shikigami
from my old receipts.

82
00:04:56,669 --> 00:04:59,369
No, this coupon expires soon!

83
00:05:02,202 --> 00:05:04,836
-All right, then, if there
are no more objections,

84
00:05:04,869 --> 00:05:07,202
let's continue with the
Keiyojuji Paranormal Patrol

85
00:05:07,236 --> 00:05:08,436
field trip!

86
00:05:08,469 --> 00:05:09,536
TOGETHER: Yay!

87
00:05:09,569 --> 00:05:12,702
We're continuing on!

88
00:05:12,736 --> 00:05:14,636
-Well, I guess
I'll be going now.

89
00:05:14,669 --> 00:05:16,702
I hope you all enjoy yourselves.

90
00:05:16,736 --> 00:05:17,802
Goodbye.

91
00:05:17,836 --> 00:05:19,002
-Please join us, professor.

92
00:05:19,036 --> 00:05:21,702
We wanna hear more of
your great Yokai stories.

93
00:05:21,736 --> 00:05:22,602
-No, no.

94
00:05:22,636 --> 00:05:23,736
By job here is done.

95
00:05:23,769 --> 00:05:26,336
I really have to get going.

96
00:05:26,369 --> 00:05:27,402
Oh yes.

97
00:05:27,436 --> 00:05:29,369
It's almost sundown.

98
00:05:29,402 --> 00:05:34,102
Once the mountain grows dark,
you must not go outside.

99
00:05:34,136 --> 00:05:34,936
-Well.

100
00:05:34,969 --> 00:05:37,036
That went smoothly.

101
00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:37,669
-Huh?

102
00:05:37,702 --> 00:05:39,102
Who could that be?

103
00:05:41,802 --> 00:05:42,802
-Damn it all.

104
00:05:42,836 --> 00:05:45,302
I got separated
from master Rikuo.

105
00:05:45,336 --> 00:05:46,769
Huh?

106
00:05:46,802 --> 00:05:47,902
Oh.

107
00:05:47,936 --> 00:05:50,669
Excuse me, do you know
the way to [inaudible]?

108
00:05:50,702 --> 00:05:53,902
-Oh, it's, uh--

109
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:55,269
-Thank you very much.

110
00:05:55,302 --> 00:05:58,369
-Don't mention it.

111
00:05:58,402 --> 00:05:59,836
Take care.

112
00:05:59,869 --> 00:06:00,936
Heh, heh, heh.

113
00:06:03,802 --> 00:06:04,669
-Yes.

114
00:06:04,702 --> 00:06:05,669
Nicely done.

115
00:06:11,102 --> 00:06:15,436
-What am I doing here like this?

116
00:06:15,469 --> 00:06:15,936
Huh?

117
00:06:32,069 --> 00:06:34,369
-You fooled them well, Mezumaru

118
00:06:34,402 --> 00:06:37,369
-Yeah, but it wasn't
easy, Gozumaru.

119
00:06:37,402 --> 00:06:39,502
-So, what do we do now?

120
00:06:39,536 --> 00:06:43,102
-First, we'll separate
them all, and then I'll

121
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:45,736
find and kill Rikuo's aid.

122
00:06:45,769 --> 00:06:49,069
-You can leave all the weaklings
to me, and I'll get rid of them

123
00:06:49,102 --> 00:06:50,102
quickly.

124
00:06:50,136 --> 00:06:53,502
-The night of the
full moon end storm.

125
00:06:53,536 --> 00:06:55,802
The perfect time to hunt
for a leader's head.

126
00:07:01,502 --> 00:07:02,536
-Good evening.

127
00:07:02,569 --> 00:07:05,002
We are honored to
welcome you to Togyobo.

128
00:07:05,036 --> 00:07:06,169
-Good evening to you.

129
00:07:06,202 --> 00:07:07,702
We're glad to be here.

130
00:07:07,736 --> 00:07:10,302
-Thanks for having us!

131
00:07:10,336 --> 00:07:12,302
RIKUO (VOICEOVER): This
place feels sorta weird.

132
00:07:21,669 --> 00:07:23,002
-What's the matter, Rikuo?

133
00:07:23,036 --> 00:07:23,802
Is something wrong?

134
00:07:23,836 --> 00:07:25,002
-Uh, no, no.

135
00:07:25,036 --> 00:07:26,002
Nothing at all.

136
00:07:26,036 --> 00:07:27,636
It's a very nice
place, isn't it?

137
00:07:27,669 --> 00:07:28,969
-It is.

138
00:07:29,002 --> 00:07:32,669
It looks like a really elegant
and well established inn.

139
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,869
-A talisman to ward off Yokai.

140
00:07:34,902 --> 00:07:35,569
You see?

141
00:07:35,602 --> 00:07:36,769
The professor was right.

142
00:07:36,802 --> 00:07:39,002
The Yokai security
here is perfect.

143
00:07:39,036 --> 00:07:39,502
-Ah!

144
00:07:44,202 --> 00:07:44,836
-Wait.

145
00:07:44,869 --> 00:07:47,436
That's the talisman?

146
00:07:47,469 --> 00:07:48,902
KIYOTSUGU: Aren't
you glad we came?

147
00:07:48,936 --> 00:07:51,869
A chance to stay in an exclusive
inn like this is so rare!

148
00:07:51,902 --> 00:07:54,902
And it's all thanks to Professor
Adashibara's connections.

149
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:06,969
RIKUO (VOICEOVER): I can't
let everyone get scared.

150
00:08:07,002 --> 00:08:11,436
I have to act natural, and
stay on alert for danger.

151
00:08:11,469 --> 00:08:15,336
-Um, can we go in the
hot springs right away?

152
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:16,636
-Oh yes.

153
00:08:16,669 --> 00:08:18,836
There's a natural outdoor bath
where you and your friends

154
00:08:18,869 --> 00:08:20,602
can soak any time you wish.

155
00:08:20,636 --> 00:08:21,636
-Yahoo!

156
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:23,869
-Let's go straight
to the outdoor bath!

157
00:08:23,902 --> 00:08:24,902
-Outdoor bath?

158
00:08:28,269 --> 00:08:30,602
-Wow.

159
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:33,536
How cool.

160
00:08:33,569 --> 00:08:35,736
-Kana, don't lag behind.

161
00:08:35,769 --> 00:08:37,436
-Where's Oikawa and Yura?

162
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:39,469
-They're-- Oh, they
were just here.

163
00:08:39,502 --> 00:08:42,869
-Yuki Onna soaking in hot
water is like suicide.

164
00:08:42,902 --> 00:08:45,402
-The girls are probably
enjoying the hot spring

165
00:08:45,436 --> 00:08:46,669
right around now.

166
00:08:46,702 --> 00:08:48,402
-That's right, Kiyotsugu.

167
00:08:48,436 --> 00:08:49,136
-Now's our chance.

168
00:08:49,169 --> 00:08:50,002
-You bet.

169
00:08:50,036 --> 00:08:51,602
Let's go out and
do it right now.

170
00:08:51,636 --> 00:08:54,069
If we time it right, I'll be
able to see Oikawa's beauty!

171
00:08:58,436 --> 00:09:00,602
-OK, Shima, time
for us to get going!

172
00:09:00,636 --> 00:09:01,436
-Right.

173
00:09:01,469 --> 00:09:03,169
We're gonna go look for Yokai!

174
00:09:03,202 --> 00:09:04,102
-Huh?

175
00:09:04,136 --> 00:09:07,936
-Uh, we're looking for Yokai?

176
00:09:07,969 --> 00:09:10,802
KIYOTSUGU: Remember Professor
Adashibara's last words?

177
00:09:10,836 --> 00:09:13,302
He said not to go out once
the mountain grows dark,

178
00:09:13,336 --> 00:09:15,102
meaning that's
when Yokai appear!

179
00:09:15,136 --> 00:09:16,036
Come on, Shima.

180
00:09:16,069 --> 00:09:16,969
Let's go!

181
00:09:17,002 --> 00:09:17,936
-No, wait!

182
00:09:17,969 --> 00:09:19,302
You shouldn't go
out there right now.

183
00:09:19,336 --> 00:09:21,902
You guys aren't taking
the Yokai seriously.

184
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:24,402
There really some Yokai
that attack humans.

185
00:09:24,436 --> 00:09:25,402
-Nura?

186
00:09:25,436 --> 00:09:26,769
-What the heck are
you saying, Nura?

187
00:09:26,802 --> 00:09:29,836
What would you know
about Yokai anyway?

188
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:31,402
Don't try to stop us.

189
00:09:31,436 --> 00:09:33,202
Unlike you, I'm
totally committed

190
00:09:33,236 --> 00:09:34,536
to my search for Yokai!

191
00:09:34,569 --> 00:09:37,336
-If you insist on
going, I'm coming too.

192
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:39,436
-It's too dangerous with
just the two of you.

193
00:09:39,469 --> 00:09:41,136
-Well, if you are
going, then I'm going.

194
00:09:41,169 --> 00:09:41,769
-Tsurara.

195
00:09:41,802 --> 00:09:44,469
-Oikawa.

196
00:09:44,502 --> 00:09:44,969
Right.

197
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:45,602
Let's go.

198
00:09:56,002 --> 00:09:58,369
-Finally, we'll get to
encounter some Yokai!

199
00:09:58,402 --> 00:09:59,436
I'm so excited.

200
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:03,202
-Hm?

201
00:10:14,436 --> 00:10:16,136
-This really is heavenly.

202
00:10:16,169 --> 00:10:17,736
-This hot spring is the best.

203
00:10:17,769 --> 00:10:20,569
-Yura and Tsurara should
be here bathing with us.

204
00:10:20,602 --> 00:10:21,569
Don't you think?

205
00:10:21,602 --> 00:10:24,869
-Yeah, they're missing out.

206
00:10:24,902 --> 00:10:26,302
KANA (VOICEOVER): Oikawa.

207
00:10:26,336 --> 00:10:29,602
Does she like Rikuo?

208
00:10:29,636 --> 00:10:32,402
Why am I so concerned?

209
00:10:32,436 --> 00:10:33,769
It's none of my business.

210
00:10:38,136 --> 00:10:40,702
Maybe Oikawa isn't here
with us because she's

211
00:10:40,736 --> 00:10:43,469
meeting up with Rikuo.

212
00:10:43,502 --> 00:10:45,669
Oh, stupid me.

213
00:10:45,702 --> 00:10:47,736
Why do I care, anyway?

214
00:10:47,769 --> 00:10:48,902
-Kana.

215
00:10:48,936 --> 00:10:51,936
Hey, Kana.

216
00:10:51,969 --> 00:10:54,236
What's the matter with you?

217
00:10:54,269 --> 00:10:57,436
-Well, I, um-- I'm getting out.

218
00:10:57,469 --> 00:10:58,302
-So soon?

219
00:10:58,336 --> 00:11:00,469
-You should soak
a little longer.

220
00:11:00,502 --> 00:11:00,969
Hey!

221
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:10,602
-Yes.

222
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:12,336
It's almost time for us to
have our dinner, isn't it?

223
00:11:27,969 --> 00:11:29,402
All right, everyone.

224
00:11:29,436 --> 00:11:31,302
Let's go down there
and fill our bellies.

225
00:11:47,932 --> 00:11:49,565
KANA (VOICEOVER):
They must be together.

226
00:11:56,532 --> 00:11:57,565
I just wanna confirm.

227
00:11:57,599 --> 00:12:00,132
That's all I wanna do.

228
00:12:15,099 --> 00:12:15,932
KIYOTSUGU: All right!

229
00:12:15,965 --> 00:12:17,565
Here we go!

230
00:12:17,599 --> 00:12:20,199
Kiyojuji Paranormal
Patrol, move out!

231
00:12:20,232 --> 00:12:21,165
Ha ha ha!

232
00:12:33,865 --> 00:12:38,932
LORD GYUKI: We'll lure
Rikuo Nura to this mountain.

233
00:12:38,965 --> 00:12:41,932
-Lord Gyuki, does
mean you're finally--

234
00:12:41,965 --> 00:12:42,432
-Yes.

235
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,332
-Mezumar, are you
trembling there?

236
00:12:49,365 --> 00:12:49,965
-No.

237
00:12:49,999 --> 00:12:53,299
I'm just excited.

238
00:12:53,332 --> 00:12:57,199
I have absolutely no objections
to your plan, my Lord Gyuki.

239
00:12:57,232 --> 00:12:59,632
Order me, and I
shall gladly obey.

240
00:12:59,665 --> 00:13:02,065
-And you, Gozumaru?

241
00:13:02,099 --> 00:13:05,132
-To defy the main family
is against our code,

242
00:13:05,165 --> 00:13:07,065
but our ultimate
duty is to carry out

243
00:13:07,099 --> 00:13:09,432
your orders, Lord Gyuki.

244
00:13:09,465 --> 00:13:11,499
We pledged our loyalty to you.

245
00:13:11,532 --> 00:13:14,265
We shall not fail in
our service to you,

246
00:13:14,299 --> 00:13:16,465
if this is the decision
you've reached, Lord Gyuki.

247
00:13:16,499 --> 00:13:18,299
-Yes, it is.

248
00:13:21,565 --> 00:13:27,132
After a very long and
careful deliberation.

249
00:13:27,165 --> 00:13:29,732
MAN: If Rikuo Nura dies on Mt.

250
00:13:29,765 --> 00:13:31,565
Nejireme, it will
be obvious that it

251
00:13:31,599 --> 00:13:34,165
was the doing of the Gyuki clan.

252
00:13:34,199 --> 00:13:37,832
There will be no
turning back for us.

253
00:13:37,865 --> 00:13:40,132
But if the decision
Lord Gyuki has reached

254
00:13:40,165 --> 00:13:42,899
is to go through with
this plan, then I

255
00:13:42,932 --> 00:13:45,465
shall accompany my lord
until the very end.

256
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:52,065
-This place is strange.

257
00:13:52,099 --> 00:13:54,232
And there doesn't seem
to be any other guests.

258
00:14:07,932 --> 00:14:09,965
-Hey, what's the matter?

259
00:14:09,999 --> 00:14:12,032
Don't tell me it's
a peeping Tom.

260
00:14:12,065 --> 00:14:14,932
I'm gonna kill those guys.

261
00:14:14,965 --> 00:14:15,732
Hey, you perverts.

262
00:14:15,765 --> 00:14:17,432
Are you peeking out there--

263
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:27,999
[scream]

264
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:37,232
-Don't come any closer!

265
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:42,165
[laughing]

266
00:14:42,199 --> 00:14:43,232
-You fools.

267
00:14:43,265 --> 00:14:46,632
I put up that talisman myself.

268
00:14:46,665 --> 00:14:47,832
-Huh?

269
00:14:47,865 --> 00:14:50,032
-This is Lord Gyuki's
territory, so that's here

270
00:14:50,065 --> 00:14:52,165
to ward off Yokai
from other clans.

271
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:56,032
-You mean this Yokai security
was made by you guys?

272
00:14:56,065 --> 00:14:58,299
-Yeah, that's right.

273
00:14:58,332 --> 00:14:59,565
So don't peel it off!

274
00:15:02,299 --> 00:15:02,765
-Rokuson!

275
00:15:09,632 --> 00:15:11,065
-A Shinigami?

276
00:15:11,099 --> 00:15:12,999
-It's Yura!

277
00:15:13,032 --> 00:15:14,999
-You Yokai have a lot
of nerve attacking girls

278
00:15:15,032 --> 00:15:16,699
who are in the
middle of bathing!

279
00:15:16,732 --> 00:15:17,899
KIYOTSUGU: Look!

280
00:15:17,932 --> 00:15:21,999
Down there is a Yokai
spot, the Ushigakure Cave!

281
00:15:22,032 --> 00:15:24,032
Legend has it that
long ago, a priest who

282
00:15:24,065 --> 00:15:25,632
was being attacked
by a group of Yokai

283
00:15:25,665 --> 00:15:27,932
took refuge in this very place.

284
00:15:27,965 --> 00:15:31,432
I mean, this is a
truly historical spot!

285
00:15:31,465 --> 00:15:32,732
Shima, go down there.

286
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,165
-Not a chance.

287
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,565
-Watch out, Master!

288
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:41,332
Oh, it's just a racoon dog.

289
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:49,599
-What a loser.

290
00:15:49,632 --> 00:15:52,099
And he's the grandson
of Nurarihyon?

291
00:15:52,132 --> 00:15:55,565
-All right, now, there are other
Yokai spots we can explore.

292
00:15:55,599 --> 00:15:58,365
-Nura, you're pretty clumsy,
so be careful where you walk.

293
00:16:14,032 --> 00:16:14,765
-Ah!

294
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:16,499
Master Rikuo, it's a trap!

295
00:16:16,532 --> 00:16:17,165
A trap!

296
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:18,465
Run away, run away!

297
00:16:18,499 --> 00:16:20,965
-It's just a spiderweb.

298
00:16:20,999 --> 00:16:21,465
-Oh.

299
00:16:25,699 --> 00:16:26,899
All right.

300
00:16:26,932 --> 00:16:31,665
This is the Yokai spot
known as the one-eyed pine!

301
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,665
Let's pass through
one at a time.

302
00:16:33,699 --> 00:16:34,765
-I'll go first.

303
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:36,799
-Wait a minute, I wanna
go through it first.

304
00:16:36,832 --> 00:16:38,899
I wanna make sure it's
safe and sound before I

305
00:16:38,932 --> 00:16:40,365
let anyone else try it.

306
00:16:49,265 --> 00:16:50,032
-Hey.

307
00:16:50,065 --> 00:16:51,599
What exactly are you up to?

308
00:16:51,632 --> 00:16:53,799
I'm just trying to
protect you, Master.

309
00:16:53,832 --> 00:16:56,365
I mean, that is my
sworn duty, after all.

310
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,432
-Well, that's really nice of
you, but you don't have to.

311
00:16:59,465 --> 00:17:00,232
-What?

312
00:17:00,265 --> 00:17:01,199
What are you talking about?

313
00:17:01,232 --> 00:17:02,265
Of course I do.

314
00:17:02,299 --> 00:17:04,432
At present, you are
in your human form,

315
00:17:04,465 --> 00:17:07,065
we're in a dangerous place,
and I don't know where Ao is.

316
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:09,199
And that means right now,
I'm the only aid here

317
00:17:09,232 --> 00:17:10,332
to protect you, sir.

318
00:17:10,365 --> 00:17:11,565
-Master.

319
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,799
Master!

320
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:15,665
Where are you, Master?

321
00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:17,532
Master!

322
00:17:17,565 --> 00:17:18,232
Seriously.

323
00:17:18,265 --> 00:17:21,432
Where in the hell am I?

324
00:17:21,465 --> 00:17:21,999
-Look.

325
00:17:22,032 --> 00:17:23,265
Never mind me.

326
00:17:23,299 --> 00:17:25,165
Think about how we can
