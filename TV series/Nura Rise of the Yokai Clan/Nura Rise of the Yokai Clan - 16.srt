NARRATOR: In days of
old, people feared Yokai.

The one who stood at the
helm, and led the night

00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:18,833
parade of a hundred
demons was known

4
00:00:18,866 --> 00:00:22,766
as the Supreme
Commander of the Yokai.

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,966
They had another name
for him, the Lord

of Pandemonium-- Nurarihyon.

00:02:22,015 --> 00:02:23,181
-Good evening and welcome.

9
00:02:23,215 --> 00:02:24,015
Oh.

10
00:02:24,048 --> 00:02:26,148
Thanks for patrolling the area.

11
00:02:26,181 --> 00:02:27,548
-Anything suspicious?

12
00:02:27,581 --> 00:02:28,148
-No.

13
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:28,715
Nothing.

14
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:29,281
Thank goodness.

15
00:02:33,881 --> 00:02:34,648
-Enjoy your stay.

16
00:02:39,981 --> 00:02:41,715
-You don't look familiar.

17
00:02:41,748 --> 00:02:43,348
Are you new?

18
00:02:43,381 --> 00:02:44,415
-Yes.

19
00:02:44,448 --> 00:02:46,848
I only just started
working here recently.

20
00:02:46,881 --> 00:02:47,881
Very nice to meet you.

21
00:02:50,781 --> 00:02:53,381
-An unusual type to be
working at this place.

22
00:02:53,415 --> 00:02:55,881
-Actually, she's turned
out to be popular.

23
00:02:55,915 --> 00:02:57,081
-These are dangerous times.

24
00:02:57,115 --> 00:02:59,481
Be careful who you allow in.

25
00:02:59,515 --> 00:03:00,181
-I will.

00:03:00,915 --> 00:03:01,481

WOMAN: Over there.

29
00:03:08,881 --> 00:03:11,315
-Huh.

30
00:03:11,348 --> 00:03:14,248
-There's been an attack
near Oiteke Canal.

31
00:03:14,281 --> 00:03:16,415
-Something happened
in the forest.

32
00:03:16,448 --> 00:03:18,581
-It seems a top official
of the Nura Clan

33
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:19,715
was attacked in the forest.

TAMAZUKI: The Nura Clan must
be in turmoil about now.

37
00:03:37,948 --> 00:03:40,381
This is fun, don't
you agree, Inugami?

38
00:03:43,081 --> 00:03:45,881
Now then, let's see how
well you handle this.

39
00:03:48,748 --> 00:03:50,481
-Looks like everyone
is here, so I

40
00:03:50,515 --> 00:03:53,881
will start by reporting
what we know so far.

41
00:03:53,915 --> 00:03:56,815
The victims are Lord
What-A-Waste Obake,

42
00:03:56,848 --> 00:03:59,548
leader of the Obake Clan,
along with his three

43
00:03:59,581 --> 00:04:02,181
personal bodyguards
from the clan.

44
00:04:02,215 --> 00:04:04,315
The injuries they sustained
are quite serious.

45
00:04:04,348 --> 00:04:05,448
-What's going on?

46
00:04:05,481 --> 00:04:07,548
All this happened
in just one night?

47
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:10,248
First it's Hihi, and now
even What-A-Waste Obake

48
00:04:10,281 --> 00:04:12,281
has been gravely wounded.

49
00:04:12,315 --> 00:04:15,115
I'm holding you
responsible for all this.

50
00:04:15,148 --> 00:04:19,181
-Hitotsume, shouldn't
we be discussing

51
00:04:19,215 --> 00:04:21,448
how to deal with the
situation instead?

52
00:04:21,481 --> 00:04:22,015
-What?

53
00:04:22,048 --> 00:04:22,581
How dare you.

54
00:04:28,515 --> 00:04:29,381
-This is terrible.

55
00:04:29,415 --> 00:04:30,981
How could this happen?

56
00:04:31,015 --> 00:04:33,181
-From my father's
investigation, it

57
00:04:33,215 --> 00:04:35,848
appears that all the crimes took
place in the short span of time

58
00:04:35,881 --> 00:04:37,115
when security was shorthanded.

59
00:04:39,715 --> 00:04:42,681
Furthermore, in the case
of Lord What-A-Waste Obake,

60
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:46,948
it seems he was ambushed
on his way home from here.

61
00:04:46,981 --> 00:04:48,781
-Are you saying that
someone from our side

62
00:04:48,815 --> 00:04:50,481
leaked information?

63
00:04:50,515 --> 00:04:51,515
-That's unforgivable!

64
00:04:51,548 --> 00:04:52,748
Who was it?

65
00:04:52,781 --> 00:04:57,081
-Master, we have to
conduct a thorough search.

66
00:04:57,115 --> 00:04:58,848
-Settle down.

67
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:01,548
We don't know
anything definite yet.

68
00:05:01,581 --> 00:05:03,181
Let Karasu Tengu handle this.

69
00:05:03,215 --> 00:05:05,515
The rest of you continue
to maintain tight security.

70
00:05:08,415 --> 00:05:10,248
We will find the culprit.

71
00:05:10,281 --> 00:05:10,748
-Yes, sir.

72
00:05:17,081 --> 00:05:20,115
-Master, things have gotten
pretty bad haven't they?

73
00:05:20,148 --> 00:05:21,048
-Yeah.

74
00:05:21,081 --> 00:05:22,681
I hate to ask, but
please continue

75
00:05:22,715 --> 00:05:25,148
to look after Kiyotsugu
and the others.

76
00:05:25,181 --> 00:05:26,115
-Of course.

77
00:05:26,148 --> 00:05:27,215
I'll never let them
out of my sight

78
00:05:27,248 --> 00:05:28,681
so that you can
focus on fulfilling

79
00:05:28,715 --> 00:05:32,248
your duties as the Third Heir.

80
00:05:32,281 --> 00:05:33,181
-Never, huh?

81
00:05:36,581 --> 00:05:38,615
-I'm so totally bored.

82
00:05:38,648 --> 00:05:40,615
-Then allow me to
share a Yokai story.

83
00:05:40,648 --> 00:05:41,981
-We've listened
to you all night.

84
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,081
I think that's enough.

85
00:05:43,115 --> 00:05:45,181
-I know Nura told us
not to, but we're bored,

86
00:05:45,215 --> 00:05:47,181
and this place begs
for an expedition.

87
00:05:47,215 --> 00:05:47,848
-Absolutely not.

88
00:05:50,215 --> 00:05:50,881
-Why not, Oikawa?

89
00:05:53,615 --> 00:05:54,948
-It's so nice outside.

90
00:05:54,981 --> 00:05:58,648
Let's do some exercises
out in the yard.

91
00:05:58,681 --> 00:05:59,781
-You're amazing, Oikawa.

92
00:05:59,815 --> 00:06:02,115
Fantastic idea!

93
00:06:02,148 --> 00:06:03,248
-Might as well.

94
00:06:03,281 --> 00:06:04,081
You?

95
00:06:04,115 --> 00:06:04,915
-Why not?

96
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,481
-I haven't exercised in a while.

97
00:06:10,448 --> 00:06:13,448
-What I saw the order day
was a battle between Yokai.

98
00:06:13,481 --> 00:06:14,581
I'm sure of it.

99
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:27,381
What exactly is
happening in this town?

100
00:06:27,415 --> 00:06:29,248
No use thinking
about it too much.

101
00:06:29,281 --> 00:06:32,015
If humans get caught in that
battle, it could be terrible.

102
00:06:35,415 --> 00:06:37,081
And I'd never let that happen.

103
00:06:46,848 --> 00:06:47,715
Yokai I aura.

104
00:06:51,081 --> 00:06:51,948
Was it my imagination?

105
00:07:01,348 --> 00:07:04,281
Excuse me, old lady.

106
00:07:04,315 --> 00:07:05,981
-Old lady?

107
00:07:06,015 --> 00:07:09,581
How unfortunate that your young
life must come to an end all

108
00:07:09,615 --> 00:07:11,615
because you saw me.

109
00:07:11,648 --> 00:07:12,815
-So you're a Yokai,

110
00:07:12,848 --> 00:07:15,348
-When and if you're
reborn, make sure you

111
00:07:15,381 --> 00:07:16,515
watch your tongue next time!

112
00:07:19,348 --> 00:07:20,881
What are you?

113
00:07:20,915 --> 00:07:23,715
You can't be an onmyoji?

114
00:07:23,748 --> 00:07:26,415
So you're the one
who fought Inuhoo?

115
00:07:26,448 --> 00:07:28,815
-Prepare to die!

116
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:29,781
-Damn it.

117
00:07:29,815 --> 00:07:32,048
I must'nt create
a scene out here.

118
00:07:32,081 --> 00:07:33,581
Until next time, little girl.

119
00:07:33,615 --> 00:07:34,081
-Wait!

120
00:07:56,115 --> 00:07:57,781
Yokai aura this way.

121
00:08:00,748 --> 00:08:01,215
This is--

122
00:08:08,881 --> 00:08:09,481
-Oh.

123
00:08:09,515 --> 00:08:10,381
If it isn't Yura.

124
00:08:10,415 --> 00:08:11,815
I'm glad you came to join us.

125
00:08:11,848 --> 00:08:12,315
-Oh.

126
00:08:12,348 --> 00:08:13,115
Hi Yura.

-Yo!

U!

00:08:38,681 --> 00:08:40,315

MRS. NURA: I'm so
glad you could come.

-Hi Mrs. Nura.

142
00:08:46,215 --> 00:08:47,781
How are you?

143
00:08:47,815 --> 00:08:51,581
-Please, have some
fresh homemade donuts.

144
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:52,081
-Thanks!

145

-Oh.

146
00:08:59,715 --> 00:09:01,048
Hi.

147
00:09:01,081 --> 00:09:04,415
Ms. Keikain, have you changed
your mind about joining us?

148
00:09:04,448 --> 00:09:05,381
-No.

149
00:09:05,415 --> 00:09:07,115
I was chasing a
Yokai, but somehow I

150
00:09:07,148 --> 00:09:09,848
ended up here for some reason.

151
00:09:09,881 --> 00:09:10,548
-Oh.

152
00:09:10,581 --> 00:09:11,915
Is that what happened?

153
00:09:11,948 --> 00:09:14,681
-I'm almost certainly it was a
Shikoku Yokai known as Kagibari

154
00:09:14,715 --> 00:09:18,181
Onna, but I can't figure out
what she'd be doing there.

155
00:09:18,215 --> 00:09:21,448
RIKUO (VOICEOVER): Did she
just say a Shikoku Yokai?

156
00:09:21,481 --> 00:09:22,515
-Hey.

157
00:09:22,548 --> 00:09:24,615
What can you tell me
about Kagibari Onna?

158
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:27,415
-She appeared from a back
alley in Ukiyoe Town.

159
00:09:27,448 --> 00:09:29,481
She may have thought
she was in disguise,

160
00:09:29,515 --> 00:09:31,515
but I could see through it.

161
00:09:31,548 --> 00:09:33,915
RIKUO (VOICEOVER): A back
alley in Ukiyoe Town?

162
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:34,681
-What is it?

163
00:09:34,715 --> 00:09:36,781
You're interested in this?

164
00:09:36,815 --> 00:09:38,281
-Not at all.

165
00:09:38,315 --> 00:09:42,015
I uh-- well I just remembered
something that I have to do.

166
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:43,315
Please, stay and relax.

167
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:51,681
Get Karasu Tengu right away.

168
00:09:51,715 --> 00:09:52,648
-Right.

169
00:09:52,681 --> 00:09:54,081
-You've been spotted
by the onmyoji?

170
00:09:56,648 --> 00:09:57,648
-Yes.

171
00:09:57,681 --> 00:09:59,748
It was the same one
who fought Inuhoo.

172
00:09:59,781 --> 00:10:01,115
I'm certain.

173
00:10:01,148 --> 00:10:03,648
-So it's that little
girl again, huh?

174
00:10:03,681 --> 00:10:06,881
There must be a connection
between her and the Nura Clan.

175
00:10:06,915 --> 00:10:09,648
But she's becoming a nuisance.

176
00:10:09,681 --> 00:10:13,281
-If I see her again I'll
be sure to get rid of her.

177
00:10:13,315 --> 00:10:14,215
-Good.

178
00:10:14,248 --> 00:10:16,515
I'm counting on you.

179
00:10:16,548 --> 00:10:18,181
-Yes.

180
00:10:18,215 --> 00:10:20,115
-Well I should be going now.

181
00:10:20,148 --> 00:10:22,515
-Yura, how's your injury doing?

182
00:10:22,548 --> 00:10:23,381
-I'm just fine.

183
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:24,781
You don't need to worry.

184
00:10:24,815 --> 00:10:25,281
-OK.

185
00:10:25,315 --> 00:10:26,681
I'm glad.

186
00:10:26,715 --> 00:10:29,648
I'll do my best to manage on my
own until you're all healed up.

187
00:10:29,681 --> 00:10:32,115
-Just try not to
overdo it, all right?

188
00:10:32,148 --> 00:10:33,081
-OK.

189
00:10:33,115 --> 00:10:33,981
RIKUO: See you.

190
00:10:34,015 --> 00:10:35,315
-See you later.

191
00:10:35,348 --> 00:10:37,481
-I'm supposed to
guard an onmyoji?

192
00:10:37,515 --> 00:10:41,415
I'm not so sure this is a good
idea, but orders are orders.

193
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,381
-Now then, we have to become
proficient at escaping

194
00:10:51,415 --> 00:10:52,481
from Yokai.

195
00:10:52,515 --> 00:10:54,381
So let's all practice uho.

196
00:10:54,415 --> 00:10:54,915
Come on.

197
00:10:54,948 --> 00:10:55,515
You too, Nura.

198
00:10:58,615 --> 00:10:59,148
-Sorry.

199
00:10:59,181 --> 00:11:00,681
I have to go.

200
00:11:00,715 --> 00:11:02,448
-Nura, wait a sec.

201
00:11:02,481 --> 00:11:03,415
-Hey!

202
00:11:03,448 --> 00:11:05,015
This uho stuff sounds like fun.

203
00:11:05,048 --> 00:11:06,015
Can you teach me?

204
00:11:06,048 --> 00:11:06,581
-Wow.

205
00:11:06,615 --> 00:11:07,681
I'm impressed.

206
00:11:07,715 --> 00:11:10,115
You're really into this,
aren't you, Oikawa?

207
00:11:10,148 --> 00:11:11,615
TSURARA (VOICEOVER):
A Yokai like me

208
00:11:11,648 --> 00:11:13,748
learning onmyoji tricks?

209
00:11:13,781 --> 00:11:17,648
Master, what will become of
me when this is all over?

210
00:11:17,681 --> 00:11:20,648
-This is a sketch
of Kagibari Onna.

211
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:23,281
After you gave us the tip,
we searched the Yokai Town

212
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:26,715
districts, and this woman
was seen at Bakenekoya.

213
00:11:26,748 --> 00:11:28,815
I asked around, and,
apparently, she frequently

214
00:11:28,848 --> 00:11:32,381
approached customers, especially
top officials of the Nura Clan.

215
00:11:32,415 --> 00:11:35,048
I'm convinced she's
Kagibari Onna.

216
00:11:35,081 --> 00:11:37,181
-So she's been spying,
and feeding information

217
00:11:37,215 --> 00:11:38,981
to the Shikoku Yokai.

218
00:11:39,015 --> 00:11:41,315
-She snuck into our territory
to ensnare our people!

219
00:11:41,348 --> 00:11:43,048
This is outrageous!

220
00:11:43,081 --> 00:11:46,148
Master, we must not
waste anymore time.

221
00:11:46,181 --> 00:11:49,148
-You're right, Karasu.

222
00:11:49,181 --> 00:11:49,981
Come on.

223
00:11:53,481 --> 00:11:54,648
It's time for work.

224
00:12:13,549 --> 00:12:15,967
-So are things busy
for you as usual?

225
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:16,834
[chuckling]

226
00:12:16,867 --> 00:12:18,101
-Sort of.

227
00:12:18,134 --> 00:12:22,301
There's another gathering
of officials tomorrow too.

228
00:12:22,334 --> 00:12:23,501
-How exciting.

229
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:24,001
Where at?

230
00:12:28,001 --> 00:12:29,367
-This looks like a woman's hair.

231
00:12:34,034 --> 00:12:35,967
-What's the matter?

232
00:12:36,001 --> 00:12:38,634
KAGIBARI ONNA (VOICEOVER):
What is this fear?

233
00:12:38,667 --> 00:12:41,067
-This wasn't here when
we passed earlier.

234
00:12:41,101 --> 00:12:44,434
-We'll probably run
into something up ahead.

235
00:12:44,467 --> 00:12:46,534
-Let's go.

236
00:12:46,567 --> 00:12:48,034
-They know.

237
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:49,001
-Huh?

238
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:50,501
Hey.

239
00:12:50,534 --> 00:12:51,501
-What's the matter?

240
00:12:57,034 --> 00:12:58,267
-Damn it.

241
00:12:58,301 --> 00:12:59,134
-Well now.

242
00:12:59,167 --> 00:13:02,834
Fancy meeting you here.

243
00:13:02,867 --> 00:13:04,834
-Oh don't tell me.

244
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,434
Was that woman the?

245
00:13:06,467 --> 00:13:07,101
-There.

246
00:13:07,134 --> 00:13:10,134
-She won't get away.

247
00:13:10,167 --> 00:13:12,401
-Just when things
were going well.

248
00:13:12,434 --> 00:13:13,434
But how did they know?

249
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:21,767
That meddling little brat!

250
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,034
I'll make her into a
souvenir for Lord Tamazuki!

251
00:13:26,934 --> 00:13:30,401
-I can't believe she was
getting information from you.

252
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:32,567
How do you intend to
clean up this mess?

253
00:13:32,601 --> 00:13:34,934
Well?

254
00:13:34,967 --> 00:13:35,901
-That's enough of that.

255
00:13:35,934 --> 00:13:37,901
What he did wasn't intentional.

256
00:13:37,934 --> 00:13:39,534
-You can't blame only me.

257
00:13:39,567 --> 00:13:41,134
This all happened
in the first place

258
00:13:41,167 --> 00:13:43,234
because our clan has
grown weak and vulnerable,

259
00:13:43,267 --> 00:13:44,867
and our leader can't unite us!

260
00:13:49,834 --> 00:13:51,601
-He got that right.

261
00:13:51,634 --> 00:13:52,101
-Master.

262
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:55,967
[glass shattering]

263
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,301
[gasp]

264
00:13:57,334 --> 00:13:58,934
-Are you all right?

265
00:13:58,967 --> 00:13:59,767
Here.

266
00:13:59,801 --> 00:14:01,634
Let me clean that up for you.

267
00:14:01,667 --> 00:14:02,767
-Thank you, Kana.

268
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:04,767
You're being a really
big help to me.

269
00:14:04,801 --> 00:14:06,001
-This is nothing.

270
00:14:06,034 --> 00:14:07,367
You've been really kind to us.

271
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:13,834
-I heard you had a run-in with
some scary Yokai recently.

272
00:14:13,867 --> 00:14:15,834
What an ordeal
that must've been.

273
00:14:15,867 --> 00:14:16,967
-Oh yes.

274
00:14:17,001 --> 00:14:18,134
Well--

275
00:14:18,167 --> 00:14:20,767
-Not all Yokai are
scary, you know.

276
00:14:20,801 --> 00:14:21,967
-Huh?

277
00:14:22,001 --> 00:14:32,034
[giggle]

278
00:14:32,034 --> 00:14:51,434
[giggle]

279
00:14:51,467 --> 00:14:51,934
Wait!

280
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:02,667
-No way.

281
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:06,167
-It's true, and then-- Kana,
where were you just now?

282
00:15:06,201 --> 00:15:08,501
-She was helping
Rikuo's mom, right?

283
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:09,734
-That's very admirable.

284
00:15:09,767 --> 00:15:11,567
You could learn a
thing or two from her.

285
00:15:11,601 --> 00:15:12,734
-Oh shut up.

286
00:15:12,767 --> 00:15:13,434
-Hey.

287
00:15:13,467 --> 00:15:16,267
Have you seen Oikawa?

288
00:15:16,301 --> 00:15:17,601
-Is something the matter?

289
00:15:17,634 --> 00:15:20,967
-Have you noticed some
strange stuff too?

290
00:15:21,001 --> 00:15:23,367
-You see earlier
outside the bathroom--

291
00:15:27,401 --> 00:15:28,234
-Here.

292
00:15:28,267 --> 00:15:29,601
-Thank you.

293
00:15:29,634 --> 00:15:32,001
SHIMA (VOICEOVER): As I was
drying my hands, I looked and--

294
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:37,867
-You must have been in the
presence of an actual Yokai!

295
00:15:37,901 --> 00:15:39,834
Why was it you and not me!?

296
00:15:39,867 --> 00:15:42,167
-Speaking of which, I've
had this eerie feeling

297
00:15:42,201 --> 00:15:43,567
since we got here.

298
00:15:43,601 --> 00:15:44,567
-Me too.

299
00:15:44,601 --> 00:15:46,467
There's gotta be
something in the house.

300
00:15:46,501 --> 00:15:47,801
-Did something happen, Kana?

301
00:15:50,701 --> 00:15:52,067
-Are you serious?

302
00:15:52,101 --> 00:15:53,701
Why hasn't anything
happened to me!?

303
00:15:53,734 --> 00:15:57,734
-You don't have a sixth sense?

304
00:15:57,767 --> 00:15:59,401
I need to go and
check on something.

305
00:16:04,634 --> 00:16:14,634
Search for "ways to meet Yokai"
Did you want something, Shima?

306
00:16:14,667 --> 00:16:15,134
-No.

307
00:16:15,167 --> 00:16:15,801
Nothing.

308
00:16:15,834 --> 00:16:16,634
Not at all.

309
00:16:23,067 --> 00:16:27,234
-Why do I have to be
the one doing this?

310
00:16:27,267 --> 00:16:27,967
Oh no.

311
00:16:28,001 --> 00:16:29,001
A split end.

312
00:16:36,634 --> 00:16:38,134
-This is where I
first met Mr. Nura.

313
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:43,601
I didn't see him
at his home today.

314
00:16:54,367 --> 00:16:55,334
-Finally found you.

315
00:16:59,334 --> 00:17:00,267
-Oh no.

316
00:17:00,301 --> 00:17:02,534
It's that Yokai again.

317
00:17:02,567 --> 00:17:03,067
This is bad.

318
00:17:09,434 --> 00:17:10,267
-I lost her.

319
00:17:29,934 --> 00:17:31,634
-This place should be fine.

320
00:17:36,501 --> 00:17:37,867
So it's you after all.

321
00:17:37,901 --> 00:17:41,401
-What's an onmyoji doing
taking sides with a Yokai Clan?

322
00:17:41,434 --> 00:17:43,034
-Siding with Yokai?

323
00:17:43,067 --> 00:17:44,634
I'd never do that.

324
00:17:44,667 --> 00:17:47,301
Now tell me, Yokai. what
is it you're scheming?

325
00:17:47,334 --> 00:17:49,767
-That's none of your business.

326
00:17:49,801 --> 00:17:52,134
Better get ready, little girl.

327
00:17:52,167 --> 00:17:54,734
I'll show you the power of
Kagibari Onna, proud member

328
00:17:54,767 --> 00:17:56,301
of the Seven Phantom Travelers!

329
00:17:56,334 --> 00:17:59,901
-In the name of the
Keikain Clan of onmyoji,

330
00:17:59,934 --> 00:18:02,401
I will exterminate all you
Ayakashi from this world!

331
00:18:09,201 --> 00:18:10,134
-Where is she?

332
00:18:16,134 --> 00:18:19,234
-Master, we've
located Kagibari Onna.

333
00:18:19,267 --> 00:18:20,634
-Is she alone?

334
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:21,134
-Actually--

335
00:18:29,434 --> 00:18:35,767
-Shikigami Roku-- My Shikigami--

336
00:18:35,801 --> 00:18:39,501
-You disappoint me, you
pathetic little girl!

337
00:18:39,534 --> 00:18:40,401
You can go to hell!

338
00:18:45,401 --> 00:18:49,301
[laughter]

339
00:18:49,334 --> 00:18:52,234
-Die!

340
00:18:52,267 --> 00:18:55,401
Who's there?

341
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:56,334
-Who is that?

342
00:19:04,134 --> 00:19:06,734
-You're with the Nura Clan.

343
00:19:06,767 --> 00:19:09,034
-You're Shikoku Yokai?

344
00:19:09,067 --> 00:19:10,967
What an unsightly
old hag you are.

345
00:19:11,001 --> 00:19:13,634
Your hair's a complete
and total mess, you know.

346
00:19:13,667 --> 00:19:17,301
-How dare you, you
ridiculous cougar!

347
00:19:17,334 --> 00:19:19,934
I'll send you to hell
along with the little girl!

of the Courtesan!

350
00:19:49,134 --> 00:19:50,867
-As if I'd lose to you.

351
00:19:50,901 --> 00:19:55,301
Now-- what was that?

352
00:19:55,334 --> 00:19:55,834
No.

353
00:19:55,867 --> 00:19:56,801
It can't be.

354
00:20:05,301 --> 00:20:07,901
-I found you, Kagibari Onna.

355
00:20:07,934 --> 00:20:09,801
-Rikuo Nura?

356
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:10,301
-Master.

357
00:20:16,001 --> 00:20:18,834
-I'll show you the power
of the Seven Phantom

358
00:20:18,867 --> 00:20:20,701
Travelers of Shikoku.

359
00:20:23,401 --> 00:20:24,667
-We'll see about that.

360
00:20:29,301 --> 00:20:30,534
-What is this guy?

361
00:20:43,667 --> 00:20:47,034
-I'm not killing you.

362
00:20:47,067 --> 00:20:49,767
Tell this to
Tamazuki-- don't use

363
00:20:49,801 --> 00:20:53,767
women to do your dirty work.

364
00:20:53,801 --> 00:20:55,234
Do this again, and you're dead.

365
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:07,934
Take Kejoro home.

366
00:21:28,234 --> 00:21:30,801
-Hey.

367
00:21:30,834 --> 00:21:33,667
-What are you doing
sitting up there?

368
00:21:33,701 --> 00:21:35,134
Where is Kagibari Onna?

369
00:21:40,101 --> 00:21:41,701
-You should take
care of your injury.

370
00:21:53,434 --> 00:21:55,734
-Just who are you anyway?

371
00:21:55,767 --> 00:21:57,534
What is it you're trying to do?

372

--[inaudible] what do your
school friends call you?

374
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:40,650
-Karata by the guys, and
some girls call me Kura.

375
00:23:40,683 --> 00:23:41,850
-Hmph.

376
00:23:41,883 --> 00:23:43,850
I should've been the one
to infiltrate the school.
