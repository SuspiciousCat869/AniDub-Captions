NARRATOR: In days of
old, people feared Yokai.

2
00:00:13,266 --> 00:00:16,600
The one who stood at the
helm and led the night

3
00:00:16,633 --> 00:00:18,933
parade of a hundred
demons was known

4
00:00:18,966 --> 00:00:22,400
as the Supreme
Commander of the Yokai.

5
00:00:22,433 --> 00:00:28,233
They had another name for
him-- The Lord of Pandemonium--

6
00:00:28,266 --> 00:00:28,733
Nurarihyon.

7
00:02:04,701 --> 00:02:10,633
[thunder]

00:02:12,421 --> 00:02:13,461

[thunder]

10
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:37,036
-Tell me what's on
your mind, Yuki.

11
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:37,802
-So.

12
00:02:37,836 --> 00:02:39,636
You've come after all.

13
00:02:39,669 --> 00:02:41,469
Then it's true.

14
00:02:41,502 --> 00:02:44,202
There's no doubt that the
blood of the Supreme Commander

15
00:02:44,236 --> 00:02:45,269
flows through you.

16
00:02:52,736 --> 00:02:55,436
And yet, when the
new morning comes,

17
00:02:55,469 --> 00:02:58,402
you will return to being
a human once again.

18
00:02:58,436 --> 00:03:01,502
And then, will you completely
forget that you are a Yokai?

19
00:03:04,036 --> 00:03:07,169
If the day does not
recognize your Yokai form,

20
00:03:07,202 --> 00:03:10,802
are you one person by
day and another by night?

21
00:03:10,836 --> 00:03:12,069
-Perhaps.

22
00:03:12,102 --> 00:03:16,636
Why is it you're so
concerned about me?

23
00:03:16,669 --> 00:03:18,169
YUKI: Fool.

remained the same.

26
00:03:37,669 --> 00:03:39,069
Since my blood
awakened that day--

[grunts]

28
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:52,669
I will become the third heir,
and rule over all Yokai.

00:04:01,636 --> 00:04:02,602
-(SLEEPILY) Huh?

30
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:24,777
NARRATOR: The handsome knight
Rikuo is only 12 years old.

31
00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:30,169
The question is, will he be
the one to lead all Yokai

32
00:04:30,202 --> 00:04:33,502
and inspire true fear?

33

[thunder]

34
00:04:34,536 --> 00:04:37,969
-All Yokai will
follow me and become

35
00:04:38,002 --> 00:04:41,236
my night parade of 100 demons.

00:04:53,469 --> 00:04:54,202
RIKUO: All right.

40
00:04:54,236 --> 00:04:56,669
Is everyone here?

41
00:04:56,702 --> 00:04:57,802
-Yes.

42
00:04:57,836 --> 00:05:00,336
Every member of the Nura
clan is in attendance.

43
00:05:00,369 --> 00:05:01,502
-Thank you, Master.

44
00:05:01,536 --> 00:05:03,736
It's great that you've
summoned us here.

45
00:05:03,769 --> 00:05:06,969
-We couldn't be more
honored as your retainers.

46
00:05:07,002 --> 00:05:08,536
-It is fitting that
you, as the third,

47
00:05:08,569 --> 00:05:09,936
have called us all together.

48
00:05:09,969 --> 00:05:11,402
Yes, yes, indeed.

49
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:12,102
-Come on.

50
00:05:12,136 --> 00:05:13,102
You're being dramatic.

51
00:05:13,136 --> 00:05:13,736
C

52
00:05:13,769 --> 00:05:15,636
-OK, Master Rikuo.

53
00:05:15,669 --> 00:05:16,836
Who are we up against?

54
00:05:16,869 --> 00:05:18,502
Give us the order and
we'll go kick their butt.

55
00:05:18,536 --> 00:05:20,236
-It's nothing like that.

56
00:05:20,269 --> 00:05:23,036
I called you together to
make a request to all of you.

57
00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:24,336
-Request?

58
00:05:24,369 --> 00:05:26,302
-You have a request for us?

59
00:05:26,336 --> 00:05:27,102
-Yes.

60
00:05:27,136 --> 00:05:28,502
Now listen.

61
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,769
You're all forbidden from going
near the old junior high school

62
00:05:30,802 --> 00:05:32,202
building tonight, understand?

63
00:05:32,236 --> 00:05:35,702
-You mean the building that
stands right behind the school?

64
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:36,502
-Mm-hm.

65
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:38,136
You all know the one I mean?

66
00:05:38,169 --> 00:05:39,936
-But how come we can't go there?

67
00:05:39,969 --> 00:05:41,302
-Because I said so.

68
00:05:41,336 --> 00:05:44,636
Anyway, just stay away from
there and do not go near it.

69
00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:47,202
I'm off to school now.

70
00:05:47,236 --> 00:05:49,236
-Uh, you're up early, Rikuo.

71
00:05:49,269 --> 00:05:50,869
I haven't packed your lunch yet.

72
00:05:50,902 --> 00:05:51,702
-It's OK.

73
00:05:51,736 --> 00:05:54,969
I'll buy something at school.

74
00:05:55,002 --> 00:05:55,636
-Please!

75
00:05:55,669 --> 00:05:57,069
Wait a moment, Master.

76
00:05:57,102 --> 00:06:00,269
It's dangerous for you
to walk outside alone.

77
00:06:00,302 --> 00:06:02,436
You should at least
take a sword with you.

78
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:03,202
-I'll be fine.

79
00:06:03,236 --> 00:06:04,069
I'm just going to school.

-Well, well.

83
00:06:15,869 --> 00:06:18,269
If it isn't Master.

84
00:06:18,302 --> 00:06:19,602
-It's been a while.

85
00:06:19,636 --> 00:06:21,102
How are you?

86
00:06:21,136 --> 00:06:23,502
-I'm glad to see that you
are looking very well today,

87
00:06:23,536 --> 00:06:24,769
Master Rikuo.

88
00:06:24,802 --> 00:06:27,736
Nothing could please me more.

89
00:06:27,769 --> 00:06:32,102
-Well, got to go to school now.

90
00:06:32,136 --> 00:06:33,069
RIKUO (VOICEOVER): Boy.

91
00:06:33,102 --> 00:06:36,269
Yuki always looks so scary.

92
00:06:36,302 --> 00:06:37,436
-Lord Yuki.

93
00:06:37,469 --> 00:06:38,802
-It's a pleasure
to see you, sir.

94
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:45,436
-I know this might sound
rather far-fetched,

95
00:06:45,469 --> 00:06:48,536
but Lord Yuki wouldn't try
to usurp Master's position

96
00:06:48,569 --> 00:06:50,602
as the third, would he?

97
00:06:50,636 --> 00:06:54,402
-He could try, but I'd
never allow such a thing.

98

[sound of water running]

YUKI: Greetings,
Supreme Commander.

100
00:07:06,602 --> 00:07:07,969
-So you've come, Yuki.

101
00:07:13,036 --> 00:07:15,669
-His appearance has
always been human,

102
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:20,969
but Master Rikuo even
thinks like he's one.

103
00:07:21,002 --> 00:07:25,469
In any age, we Yokai should be
held in awe by humans, dreaded,

104
00:07:25,502 --> 00:07:30,602
in fact, as ones who are
capable of instilling true fear.

105
00:07:30,636 --> 00:07:33,236
We live in strange
and difficult times.

106
00:07:33,269 --> 00:07:36,169
Perhaps we should now
reaffirm the solemn oath

107
00:07:36,202 --> 00:07:38,902
we made on your emblem.

108
00:07:38,936 --> 00:07:39,902
-Master!

109
00:07:39,936 --> 00:07:42,269
You must succeed the
Nura clan, or else.

110
00:07:42,302 --> 00:07:43,369
-Enough.

111
00:07:43,402 --> 00:07:44,836
Will you stop following
me around, please?

112
00:07:44,869 --> 00:07:45,336
-Oh!

113
00:07:55,269 --> 00:07:56,069
-Humph.

114
00:07:56,102 --> 00:07:57,869
Why should I care about Yokai?

115
00:07:57,902 --> 00:08:00,636
I just want to be an
average human and--

116
00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:01,736
-Kana!

117
00:08:01,769 --> 00:08:03,269
Did you hear about the
old school building?

118
00:08:03,302 --> 00:08:04,369
-The old school building?

119
00:08:04,402 --> 00:08:05,802
What's that?

120
00:08:05,836 --> 00:08:07,402
-It's right here on
the school grounds,

121
00:08:07,436 --> 00:08:09,736
but no one is allowed
to go inside of it.

122
00:08:09,769 --> 00:08:12,036
I hear that it's
haunted by Yokai.

123
00:08:12,069 --> 00:08:13,536
-That's so scary!

124
00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:14,869
-Yeah.

125
00:08:14,902 --> 00:08:15,936
-Oh, come on.

126
00:08:15,969 --> 00:08:21,102
There's no such thing as
Yokai, is there, Rikuo?

127
00:08:21,136 --> 00:08:24,936
-Uh, r-- right.

00:08:29,736 --> 00:08:33,402
-By the way, guys, are you all
going to make it for tonight?

131
00:08:33,436 --> 00:08:35,402
-You bet I am, Kiyotsugu!

132
00:08:35,436 --> 00:08:36,936
You're going too, right?

133
00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:37,836
-Mm-hm.

134
00:08:37,869 --> 00:08:38,936
-All right.

135
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:40,269
What are you talking about?

136
00:08:40,302 --> 00:08:43,269
-Tonight, we are going
to explore the old school

137
00:08:43,302 --> 00:08:44,102
building.

138
00:08:44,136 --> 00:08:45,869
We're going to look for Yokai!

139
00:08:45,902 --> 00:08:46,736
GIRL'S VOICE: Huh?

140
00:08:46,769 --> 00:08:48,069
Really?

141
00:08:48,102 --> 00:08:50,669
-You're really into
this Yokai stuff.

142
00:08:50,702 --> 00:08:52,269
I don't get it.

143
00:08:52,302 --> 00:08:53,969
It's just an empty building.

144
00:08:54,002 --> 00:08:56,302
You probably started the
rumors about it yourself.

145
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:57,602
-They're not rumors.

146
00:08:57,636 --> 00:09:00,469
I saw them with my own
eyes, four years ago.

147
00:09:00,502 --> 00:09:03,302
Yokai really do exist.

GIRL'S VOICE:
You're lying, right?

149
00:09:04,736 --> 00:09:07,236
Come on, there's no
such thing, right?

150
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:08,869
KIYOTSUGU: I know
what's going on here.

151
00:09:08,902 --> 00:09:10,936
You guys are just
afraid of Yokai.

152
00:09:10,969 --> 00:09:12,369
-Not really.

153
00:09:12,402 --> 00:09:13,902
We don't know
anything about Yokai,

154
00:09:13,936 --> 00:09:15,802
so how could we
be afraid of them?

155
00:09:19,436 --> 00:09:20,636
Right, Rikuo?

156
00:09:20,669 --> 00:09:21,969
-Mm-hm.

157
00:09:22,002 --> 00:09:24,702
KIYOTSUGU: In that case, why
don't you come and join us?

158
00:09:24,736 --> 00:09:27,869
It's your big chance
to learn about Yokai.

159
00:09:27,902 --> 00:09:29,802
-Uh, but it's too
dangerous for girls.

160
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:30,736
-It's OK.

161
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:31,836
I don't mind going there.

162
00:09:31,869 --> 00:09:34,936
And besides, there's
no such thing as Yokai.

It's a good thing

I'll be fine.

There's no such thing
as Yokai, anyway.

I'm sure of it.

00:12:10,975 --> 00:12:12,842
There's got to be Yokai in here.

-Oh, no.

It seems I'm feeling a
little scared after all.

-Uh, don't worry, Kana.

We won't see any Yokai tonight.

-Why is that?

246
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:24,875
-Oh, that, um, well, it's
because if anything happens

that for, Nura?

something, Rikuo?

-Don't you lay a
hand on our master.

335
00:16:36,475 --> 00:16:39,275
We are your opponents.

336
00:16:39,309 --> 00:16:40,542
YUKI: Supreme Commander.

337
00:16:40,575 --> 00:16:42,575
Do you know how
many years it's been

338
00:16:42,609 --> 00:16:45,009
since the second
heir passed away?

339
00:16:45,042 --> 00:16:46,975
You were already retired.

340
00:16:47,009 --> 00:16:50,575
How long will you continue
to stand in for him?

341
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:53,175
-I have told you all
time and time again.

342
00:16:53,209 --> 00:16:58,209
The third heir to lead the Nura
clan and its 72 organizations

343
00:16:58,242 --> 00:17:03,975
comprised of 10,000 Yokai
will be my grandson, Rikuo.

344
00:17:04,009 --> 00:17:07,109
-Yes, but Master Rikuo
is still so very young.

345
00:17:07,142 --> 00:17:10,375
-And I have heard that
Master Rikuo has no desire

346
00:17:10,409 --> 00:17:12,575
to succeed you.

347
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:13,775
-Unbelievable.

348
00:17:13,809 --> 00:17:15,842
-Supreme Commander, is what
they speak of the truth?

349
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,709
-I have also heard that
he awakened his Yokai

350
00:17:17,742 --> 00:17:19,242
self only once.

351
00:17:19,275 --> 00:17:22,475
And that was four years ago.

352
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:25,075
YUKI: Everyone
makes a valid point.

However, the character
fear is written

355
00:17:33,042 --> 00:17:35,275
as a demon holding a whip.

356
00:17:35,309 --> 00:17:40,575
Namely, it represents the
ruler of the world of darkness.

357
00:17:40,609 --> 00:17:44,390
Let us wait for the
day when Master Rikuo

358
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:49,467
takes hold of the whip
and inspires true fear.

RIKUO: All right, you two.

366
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:31,042
Why did you come here?

367
00:18:31,075 --> 00:18:33,409
-Master, we've been
guarding and protecting you

368
00:18:33,442 --> 00:18:36,109
since that fateful
day four years ago.

369
00:18:36,142 --> 00:18:38,475
-And we're always by your side.

370
00:18:38,509 --> 00:18:40,009
-Always?

371
00:18:40,042 --> 00:18:41,542
-We'll explain it later.

372
00:18:41,575 --> 00:18:45,109
Our first priority is
to get you out of here.

Oh.

-You see, we both watch over
you wherever you go, ever

377
00:19:00,742 --> 00:19:02,142
since that night
when you awakened

378
00:19:02,175 --> 00:19:05,475
to your other
self, Master Rikuo.

379
00:19:05,509 --> 00:19:09,309
Does this appearance
look familiar to you?

380
00:19:09,342 --> 00:19:09,809
-Huh?

381
00:19:24,242 --> 00:19:28,075
Oikawa and Kurata
from class one?

-Yes.

383
00:19:29,442 --> 00:19:33,042
Master, it is very important
that you succeed your father

384
00:19:33,075 --> 00:19:35,209
as the third heir.

385
00:19:35,242 --> 00:19:38,142
-We will wait however
long it takes.

386
00:19:38,175 --> 00:19:38,642
-Oh.

387
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:46,042
-We'll wait for the
glorious day when

388
00:19:46,075 --> 00:19:49,175
you will rise up and lead the
night parade of 100 demons,

389
00:19:49,209 --> 00:19:53,342
just as you did four years ago.

I told you.

391
00:19:54,742 --> 00:19:58,042
I don't remember a single
thing about that day.

392
00:19:58,075 --> 00:20:00,975
I'm just a human being.

-Master.

that way, as human.

It's all right, Kana.

There weren't any Yokai there.
