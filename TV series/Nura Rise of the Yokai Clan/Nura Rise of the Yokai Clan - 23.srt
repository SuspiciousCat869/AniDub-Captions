00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,866
NARRATOR: In days of
old, people feared Yokai.

2
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,000
The who stood at the helm and
led the Night Parade of 100

3
00:00:17,033 --> 00:00:22,966
Demons was known as the
supreme commander of the Yokai.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,966
They had another name
for him, the Lord

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,433
of Pandemonium, Nurarihyon.

6
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,133
[theme music]

7
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:09,467
NARRATOR: For the Nura
clan and its third heir,

8
00:02:09,467 --> 00:02:14,900
Rikuo Nura, a long, fierce
night was about to begin.

9
00:02:24,367 --> 00:02:26,400
-I'll go in first and
distract the enemy,

10
00:02:26,434 --> 00:02:28,834
then you guys go
in for the attack.

11
00:02:28,867 --> 00:02:30,634
-I will keep Master Rikuo safe.

12
00:02:39,734 --> 00:02:42,667
-Just leave all those who are
wounded in battle to my care.

13
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,800
-We'll meet you
guys there after we

14
00:02:53,834 --> 00:02:55,467
take care of things on our end.

15
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,267
-Sounds good.

16
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,534
-A hazy moon.

17
00:03:05,567 --> 00:03:08,600
Looks like it's going
to be a long night.

18
00:03:08,634 --> 00:03:11,000
As long as that
moon is visible, I

19
00:03:11,034 --> 00:03:13,634
want you to entrust
your lives to me.

20
00:03:13,667 --> 00:03:14,134
ALL: Yeah!

21
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,600
GIRL (VOICEOVER):
Darkness And Ice.

22
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,334
-Hurry up, Mezu.

23
00:03:27,367 --> 00:03:29,034
You've got to keep up with me.

24
00:03:29,067 --> 00:03:29,534
-I know.

25
00:03:29,567 --> 00:03:30,034
I am.

26
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,934
KANA: Something wrong, Yura?

27
00:03:35,967 --> 00:03:39,534
-Oh, it's nothing.

28
00:03:39,567 --> 00:03:40,867
This feels so good.

29
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:44,867
I haven't had a chance to
relax in a bathtub for a while.

30
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,834
-It's rough being an
Onmyoji, isn't it?

31
00:03:46,867 --> 00:03:47,600
-Yeah.

32
00:03:47,634 --> 00:03:50,634
And I'm still in training.

33
00:03:50,667 --> 00:03:53,900
Ienaga, why didn't you run when
that suspicious looking guy

34
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:57,534
started talking to you?

35
00:03:57,567 --> 00:04:01,834
-Because he reminded
me of another person.

36
00:04:07,667 --> 00:04:10,700
But he turned out to
be nothing like him.

37
00:04:10,734 --> 00:04:14,500
The person I know
is really scary,

38
00:04:14,534 --> 00:04:17,767
but he makes me feel safe.

39
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:22,734
That guy, Tamazuki,
was very different.

40
00:04:22,767 --> 00:04:25,600
He was really creepy.

41
00:04:25,634 --> 00:04:28,334
Just thinking about him
makes me sick to my stomach.

42
00:04:36,834 --> 00:04:39,400
That's why I was really happy
when you came to my rescue,

43
00:04:39,434 --> 00:04:41,167
and then you said you'd
come over and spend

44
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,467
the night with me.

45
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,934
-Ienaga, this person
you keep talking of--

46
00:04:46,967 --> 00:04:50,900
is he the same Yokai
who saved us that day?

47
00:04:50,934 --> 00:04:52,134
-Mm-hm.

48
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:53,100
-I knew it.

49
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,200
I'd better get out.

50
00:04:57,234 --> 00:04:58,600
I'm feeling a little dizzy.

51
00:05:08,834 --> 00:05:12,934
BOY: This was the one
thing I didn't want to do.

52
00:05:12,967 --> 00:05:13,734
Everyone?

53
00:05:13,767 --> 00:05:14,234
-Huh?

54
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:22,100
-We brought all
of you some food.

55
00:05:22,134 --> 00:05:24,900
Being disguised as a girl
is so damn embarrassing.

56
00:05:24,934 --> 00:05:27,000
Stupid Gozumaru.

57
00:05:27,034 --> 00:05:30,567
-I'm in disguise, too.

58
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,500
-You call thing a disguise?

59
00:05:32,534 --> 00:05:34,400
-This is the best I can do.

60
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:37,867
-So, did Lord Tamazuki hire you
to bring us some provisions?

61
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,000
You're pretty cute
up close, you know?

62
00:05:40,034 --> 00:05:42,400
-Oh, really?

63
00:05:42,434 --> 00:05:43,167
-Wow.

64
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,667
There are so many of you.

65
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,567
Got to hand it to Lord Tamazuki.

66
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,134
-Well, he is the one
who got his hands

67
00:05:48,167 --> 00:05:49,900
on the Legacy of the Conqueror.

68
00:05:49,934 --> 00:05:52,534
-The Legacy of the Conqueror?

69
00:05:52,567 --> 00:05:54,100
-You're absolutely right.

70
00:05:54,134 --> 00:05:56,234
-With the devil's blade
in his possession,

71
00:05:56,267 --> 00:05:58,167
a Shikoku victory is certain.

72
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,200
MAN: The enemy is coming!

73
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:00,067
Get ready!

74
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,834
-What?

75
00:06:01,867 --> 00:06:04,367
Let's go grab a drink
after the fight.

76
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,134
[nervous laughter]

77
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:08,700
-The devil's blade, huh?

78
00:06:08,734 --> 00:06:09,800
-Now hold it, Gozumaru.

79
00:06:09,834 --> 00:06:10,934
You're not gonna--

80
00:06:10,967 --> 00:06:12,800
-This Legacy of
the Conqueror seems

81
00:06:12,834 --> 00:06:15,234
to be the source of
Tamazuki's power, right?

82
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,367
Let's steal it, then impress
the guys back at the main house.

83
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,900
-I knew it.

84
00:06:22,934 --> 00:06:23,767
-Now's our chance.

85
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,700
[crash]

86
00:06:24,734 --> 00:06:25,200
-Huh?

87
00:06:34,467 --> 00:06:37,400
-I hate guys who
are too talkative.

88
00:06:37,434 --> 00:06:42,067
So I thought I'd teach them a
lesson in manners using this.

89
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,700
BOY: Summon the devil?

90
00:06:45,734 --> 00:06:48,167
-And in just a
moment, the two of you

91
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,567
will feel the power
of this blade, too.

92
00:07:20,067 --> 00:07:23,067
I've been expecting
you, Rikuo Nura!

93
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,500
[laughter]

94
00:07:25,534 --> 00:07:27,100
How nice.

95
00:07:27,134 --> 00:07:28,534
You have the eyes
of a challenger

96
00:07:28,567 --> 00:07:30,700
who doesn't know his own limits.

97
00:07:30,734 --> 00:07:34,000
However, that's all
going to end here.

98
00:07:34,034 --> 00:07:36,400
Now behold, the
power of Tamazuki!

99
00:07:45,834 --> 00:07:48,300
-Look at Lord Tamazuki!

100
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:51,234
-He's transformed
into his Yokai form!

101
00:07:51,267 --> 00:07:53,467
-You mean that's his true form?

102
00:08:01,134 --> 00:08:04,034
-The time has come
to realize my dream.

103
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:06,967
In the name of 88
demons of Shikoku,

104
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,234
I shall now take your
life, and your fear,

105
00:08:10,267 --> 00:08:12,200
as I promised you I would.

106
00:08:14,867 --> 00:08:16,800
-Are you done
talking now, Tanuki?

107
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:21,900
-Yes!

108
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:24,034
The glory is all mine!

109
00:08:24,067 --> 00:08:25,034
-I got this.

110
00:08:35,334 --> 00:08:35,800
-Move it!

111
00:08:39,767 --> 00:08:44,434
-Now, the great Battle of
the Night Parades will begin.

112
00:08:44,467 --> 00:08:45,734
Go, my Yokai!

113
00:08:45,767 --> 00:08:47,934
Go and lay down
your life for me!

114
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:49,867
-Let's go get him, everyone!

115
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,300
[shouting]

116
00:08:52,334 --> 00:08:52,967
-Master!

117
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
What are you doing?

118
00:08:57,034 --> 00:08:57,967
-Master!

119
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,300
Please wait!

120
00:08:59,334 --> 00:09:00,900
-Look, their
commander's all alone.

121
00:09:00,934 --> 00:09:02,867
-We'll be heroes if we kill him.

122
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,434
TAMAZUKI (VOICEOVER):
Has he gone mad?

123
00:09:04,467 --> 00:09:05,934
He's supposed to
be their commander.

124
00:09:08,867 --> 00:09:09,934
-Rikuo Nura!

125
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:12,067
Hey Tamazuki, he's mine.

126
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,100
I'm tear him to pieces!

127
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,700
-Very well, Inugami.

128
00:09:17,734 --> 00:09:20,634
Then bring me his head.

129
00:09:20,667 --> 00:09:25,934
[shouting]

130
00:09:25,967 --> 00:09:28,334
TAMAZUKI (VOICEOVER): He's
making himself an easy target.

131
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:29,434
What a fool.

132
00:09:29,467 --> 00:09:33,300
I think this battle
will end very quickly.

133
00:09:33,334 --> 00:09:34,300
-Follow Master Rikuo!

134
00:09:39,267 --> 00:09:42,234
-I shall protect you, master!

135
00:09:42,267 --> 00:09:45,467
-We'll go this way,
for a surprise attack!

136
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,434
Who's there?

137
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,834
-A Dance of the Black Weapons!

138
00:10:03,234 --> 00:10:05,567
It turns out you're pretty
useful just sitting there

139
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,100
like that.

140
00:10:10,134 --> 00:10:11,600
-Hold it.

141
00:10:11,634 --> 00:10:13,767
Your opponent is
standing right here.

142
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,100
I guess you still haven't
learned your lesson, old lady?

143
00:10:17,134 --> 00:10:18,334
Fine, then.

144
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:21,000
Let's settle this
right here and now.

145
00:10:21,034 --> 00:10:21,900
-Take this.

146
00:10:21,934 --> 00:10:24,534
Needle Hell!

147
00:10:24,567 --> 00:10:26,734
-You'll have to do
better than that.

148
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,534
-Master?

149
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:36,667
Where'd he go?

150
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,567
[shouting]

151
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,367
-Pick on someone your own size.

152
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,800
Hurry up and go to Master Rikuo.

153
00:10:45,834 --> 00:10:47,467
-Where are you?

154
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:47,967
Riko Nura!

155
00:10:50,934 --> 00:10:51,767
Show yourself!

156
00:10:54,767 --> 00:10:57,300
-Where is he?

157
00:10:57,334 --> 00:10:59,234
-I can't say for
certain, but perhaps he's

158
00:10:59,267 --> 00:11:01,267
already been killed
by one of our men.

159
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,067
-Lord Tamazuki, what is it?

160
00:11:16,534 --> 00:11:18,434
-What are you all doing?

161
00:11:18,467 --> 00:11:21,034
The enemy commander's
walking past you!

162
00:11:21,067 --> 00:11:22,967
Why isn't anyone attacking?

163
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,467
Can they not see
him walking there?

164
00:11:27,067 --> 00:11:27,508
-Hey.

165
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:34,708
-Huh?

166
00:11:34,741 --> 00:11:37,675
Why are the two commanders
going head to head?

167
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:38,708
-I see.

168
00:11:38,741 --> 00:11:40,641
Your presence
overwhelms your enemies

169
00:11:40,675 --> 00:11:43,408
to the point where they
can't even see you anymore.

170
00:11:43,441 --> 00:11:45,941
So this is the
fear you possess--

171
00:11:45,975 --> 00:11:48,875
the power of Nurarihyon!

172
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:50,308
-Master!

173
00:11:50,341 --> 00:11:52,741
-There you are, Rikuo Nura!

174
00:11:57,608 --> 00:12:01,741
-I will not allow you to
get close to our master.

175
00:12:01,775 --> 00:12:03,175
-Hold on, master.

176
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:04,108
I'm coming!

177
00:12:19,407 --> 00:12:23,841
-Strawberry milk hits the
spot after a hot bath.

178
00:12:23,874 --> 00:12:26,007
-Yokai.

179
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:27,807
-Um, hey, Yura?

180
00:12:27,841 --> 00:12:28,607
What are you doing?

181
00:12:33,074 --> 00:12:34,407
-Peanuts?

182
00:12:34,441 --> 00:12:37,507
Don't tell me you and that Yokai
leader were in here eating?

183
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:38,374
-Huh?

184
00:12:38,407 --> 00:12:39,807
Why in the world
would I do that?

185
00:12:39,841 --> 00:12:42,507
I mean, I don't
even know who he is.

186
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:45,041
-Listen, I know you like
him, but he's bad news.

187
00:12:45,074 --> 00:12:45,841
-Huh?

188
00:12:45,874 --> 00:12:47,941
-Yokai will always be evil.

189
00:12:47,974 --> 00:12:50,841
You'll only get yourself hurt.

190
00:12:50,874 --> 00:12:51,507
-I don't know.

191
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:52,541
Maybe you're right.

192
00:12:52,574 --> 00:12:54,674
But you know what?

193
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:58,274
That's something that I
need to find out for myself.

194
00:12:58,307 --> 00:13:01,174
Please try to understand.

195
00:13:01,207 --> 00:13:03,174
-I see.

196
00:13:03,207 --> 00:13:05,641
[gasp]

197
00:13:05,674 --> 00:13:07,507
-What's the matter?

198
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:09,741
-I don't believe this.

199
00:13:09,774 --> 00:13:14,607
I've never sensed Such
massive Yokai aura.

200
00:13:14,641 --> 00:13:15,974
I have to go.

201
00:13:16,007 --> 00:13:19,141
Something terrible is
starting to happen out there.

202
00:13:22,107 --> 00:13:25,974
[car horns]

203
00:13:32,407 --> 00:13:33,841
-Aw.

204
00:13:33,874 --> 00:13:36,541
What happened just now?

205
00:13:36,574 --> 00:13:38,741
-I just got a case
of the chills.

206
00:13:38,774 --> 00:13:40,774
-Tell me why we're
having club activities

207
00:13:40,807 --> 00:13:42,207
in the park at night.

208
00:13:42,241 --> 00:13:44,541
And I can't seem to
reach Kana, either.

209
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:46,341
-Well, the chances
of seeing Yokai

210
00:13:46,374 --> 00:13:49,374
are a lot better at night.

211
00:13:49,407 --> 00:13:50,207
-Hey.

212
00:13:50,241 --> 00:13:51,541
What's the matter, Kiyotsugu?

213
00:13:51,574 --> 00:13:52,941
-Wow, look at this, Shima.

214
00:13:52,974 --> 00:13:54,207
-Huh?

215
00:13:54,241 --> 00:13:56,541
-Lots of reports of Yokai
sightings in Ukiyoe Town!

216
00:13:56,574 --> 00:13:57,474
-Amazing.

217
00:13:57,507 --> 00:13:58,541
-What is this?

218
00:13:58,574 --> 00:14:00,641
It's going so fast,
I can't read it.

219
00:14:03,307 --> 00:14:03,841
-Hm?

220
00:14:03,874 --> 00:14:04,841
-OK, let's go!

221
00:14:04,874 --> 00:14:06,174
-Uh, go where?

222
00:14:06,207 --> 00:14:07,507
You don't mean--

223
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:08,707
-Yes, that's right!

224
00:14:08,741 --> 00:14:11,841
We're going on a Yokai
field trip to Ukiyoe Town!

225
00:14:11,874 --> 00:14:13,341
[laughter]

226
00:14:31,807 --> 00:14:32,774
-Heh, heh.

227
00:14:38,841 --> 00:14:41,207
You were careless.

228
00:14:41,241 --> 00:14:45,841
Now, you shall learn the
power of those who follow me.

229
00:14:49,907 --> 00:14:52,507
-What is this?

230
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,874
My eyes!

231
00:14:54,907 --> 00:14:56,874
TAMAZUKI: Get him!

232
00:14:56,907 --> 00:14:57,774
-Meikyo Shisui Sakura!

233
00:15:03,641 --> 00:15:04,107
-What--

234
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,474
[screaming]

235
00:15:10,507 --> 00:15:12,441
TAMAZUKI: Impressive,
Rikuo Nura.

236
00:15:12,474 --> 00:15:16,841
However, that's
as far as you go.

237
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:18,341
-It's dark.

238
00:15:18,374 --> 00:15:19,841
I can't see a thing.

239
00:15:19,874 --> 00:15:23,507
TAMAZUKI: The principals of yin
and yang exist in this world.

240
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:26,974
That is to say, there
is darkness and light.

241
00:15:27,007 --> 00:15:29,741
The darkness signifies Yokai.

242
00:15:29,774 --> 00:15:32,841
We make ourselves disappear
into the darkness.

243
00:15:32,874 --> 00:15:36,141
We are the shadows of the world.

244
00:15:36,174 --> 00:15:39,707
Light signifies humans.

245
00:15:39,741 --> 00:15:44,141
They live in the sunlight
and fear the darkness.

246
00:15:44,174 --> 00:15:48,774
Light dispels darkness, and
the darkness devours light.

247
00:15:48,807 --> 00:15:52,007
In other words, it's
impossible for humans and Yokai

248
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:54,674
to exist at the same time.

249
00:15:54,707 --> 00:15:57,607
And so your existence
too is not possible.

250
00:16:00,974 --> 00:16:05,674
Abandon the light and come
into the world of darkness.

251
00:16:05,707 --> 00:16:10,874
Then you will finally
become a complete being.

252
00:16:10,907 --> 00:16:13,574
This world has become
far too bright,

253
00:16:13,607 --> 00:16:16,774
but together, you and I
can fill it with darkness.

254
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:27,507
Let me ask you,
Rikuo Nura, won't you

255
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:32,974
become part of my 88
demons of Shikoku?

256
00:16:33,007 --> 00:16:36,441
-I refuse.

257
00:16:36,474 --> 00:16:39,707
Light is radiant because
there is darkness.

258
00:16:39,741 --> 00:16:43,741
And darkness is sublime
because there is light.

259
00:16:43,774 --> 00:16:44,841
-I see.

260
00:16:44,874 --> 00:16:47,207
What a shame.

261
00:16:47,241 --> 00:16:49,574
Then I'll just kill you!

262
00:16:49,607 --> 00:16:50,541
-I can't see.

263
00:16:50,574 --> 00:16:52,041
I'm being swallowed
by the darkness.

264
00:16:57,374 --> 00:16:59,307
-You will not lay a hand on him.

265
00:16:59,341 --> 00:17:00,641
-What is this?

266
00:17:00,674 --> 00:17:02,907
It's cold.

267
00:17:02,941 --> 00:17:07,241
It's like the time
when I was little.

268
00:17:07,274 --> 00:17:09,207
(CHILD'S VOICE) I was
playing in the garden,

269
00:17:09,241 --> 00:17:13,741
and before I knew it, everything
turned black around me.

270
00:17:13,774 --> 00:17:14,707
I couldn't see a thing.

271
00:17:17,707 --> 00:17:25,474
Except in one spot, skin
as white a snow stood out.

272
00:17:30,974 --> 00:17:32,907
-So here you are, Master.

273
00:17:32,941 --> 00:17:34,907
Master, snap out of it!

274
00:17:34,941 --> 00:17:35,807
-Such impudence.

275
00:17:35,841 --> 00:17:36,874
Prepare to die!

276
00:17:36,907 --> 00:17:40,274
-This way.

277
00:17:40,307 --> 00:17:41,941
-Yuki Onna.

278
00:17:41,974 --> 00:17:42,741
You idiot.

279
00:17:42,774 --> 00:17:43,941
Stay back.

280
00:17:43,974 --> 00:17:47,307
This is between me and him.

281
00:17:47,341 --> 00:17:48,907
-It's your eyes, isn't it?

282
00:17:48,941 --> 00:17:51,507
-Just stay back!

283
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:53,341
-Stop trying to act so tough!

284
00:17:53,374 --> 00:17:55,374
You would be lying
dead right now

285
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,107
if I hadn't shown
up to save you.

286
00:17:57,141 --> 00:17:59,407
You are so exasperating.

287
00:17:59,441 --> 00:18:00,141
Listen up!

288
00:18:00,174 --> 00:18:01,274
I'm your opponent now!

289
00:18:01,307 --> 00:18:01,774
-No.

290
00:18:01,807 --> 00:18:02,607
Get out.

291
00:18:02,641 --> 00:18:04,874
-Rikuo Nura's guardian.

292
00:18:04,907 --> 00:18:08,541
You can show us just how
loyal you really are.

293
00:18:08,574 --> 00:18:10,241
Get her.

294
00:18:10,274 --> 00:18:11,107
-Run away, Yuki Onna.

295
00:18:11,141 --> 00:18:12,707
That Yokai's Yosuzume.

296
00:18:12,741 --> 00:18:13,207
-Huh?

297
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:27,007
This is Yosuzume

298
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:28,974
MAN: It's pitch black!

299
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:31,441
MAN: What is this?

300
00:18:31,474 --> 00:18:32,107
-What?

301
00:18:32,141 --> 00:18:33,407
-I can't see a thing.

302
00:18:40,841 --> 00:18:42,307
-So, here you are, Master.

303
00:18:42,341 --> 00:18:44,741
I was worried about you.

304
00:18:44,774 --> 00:18:47,707
I thought you came into
contact with Yosuzume.

305
00:18:47,741 --> 00:18:48,707
-Yosuzume?

306
00:18:48,741 --> 00:18:50,074
-That's right.

307
00:18:50,107 --> 00:18:53,207
I've heard that the feather
of the Yokai known as Yosuzume

308
00:18:53,241 --> 00:18:55,774
can slip into the eye through
the tiniest of openings

309
00:18:55,807 --> 00:18:58,641
and create total darkness
for whoever encounters him.

310
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:05,207
-Is that the best of
your so-called loyalty?

311
00:19:05,241 --> 00:19:06,507
Pathetic.

312
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:08,074
Your guardian is useless.

313
00:19:13,341 --> 00:19:14,641
-Yosuzume.

314
00:19:14,674 --> 00:19:16,374
Show them what
you can really do.

315
00:19:27,107 --> 00:19:30,141
-It's awfully quiet
all of the sudden.

316
00:19:30,174 --> 00:19:31,241
What is that?

317
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:36,541
Gozumaru?

318
00:19:36,574 --> 00:19:37,407
Mezumaru?

319
00:19:37,441 --> 00:19:38,074
What happened?

320
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:44,307
Take them to Lord Zen.

321
00:19:44,341 --> 00:19:44,807
-OK.

322
00:19:50,574 --> 00:19:52,707
-Yuki Onna, run!

323
00:19:52,741 --> 00:19:55,107
-Rikuo Nura.

324
00:19:55,141 --> 00:19:56,874
it's time for the
curtain to fall.

325
00:20:01,107 --> 00:20:03,041
TAMAZUKI: It's his fear.

326
00:20:03,074 --> 00:20:04,541
Dammit.

327
00:20:04,574 --> 00:20:06,274
He's disappearing again.

328
00:20:15,341 --> 00:20:18,574
RIKUO (VOICEOVER):
What is that sword?

329
00:20:18,607 --> 00:20:20,174
-Yuki Onna.

330
00:20:20,207 --> 00:20:21,974
Is that you there?

331
00:20:22,007 --> 00:20:22,541
-Yes.

332
00:20:22,574 --> 00:20:24,374
I'm behind you.

333
00:20:24,407 --> 00:20:26,174
-I thought I told
you to run away.

334
00:20:26,207 --> 00:20:30,407
-Yeah, like I would
ever do such a thing.

335
00:20:30,441 --> 00:20:33,241
I shall protect you forever.

336
00:20:33,274 --> 00:20:35,641
I pledged my complete
and total loyalty to you.

337
00:20:39,974 --> 00:20:42,907
-All right then, Yuki Onna.

338
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:44,341
You cover my back.

339
00:20:44,374 --> 00:20:45,241
-Yes, sir.

340
00:20:45,274 --> 00:20:46,507
You can count on me.

341
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:50,941
I'm going to stop Yosuzume's
Yokai spell of darkness.

342
00:20:50,974 --> 00:20:54,574
-What do you think you can
do in your sorry state?

343
00:20:54,607 --> 00:20:56,241
Go, Yosuzume!

344
00:20:56,274 --> 00:20:57,074
Finish them off!

345
00:21:05,841 --> 00:21:07,374
-She froze her left eye.

346
00:21:07,407 --> 00:21:09,607
The feather didn't penetrate?

347
00:21:09,641 --> 00:21:10,107
RIKUO: Stop!

348
00:21:10,141 --> 00:21:12,041
Yosuzume!

349
00:21:12,074 --> 00:21:14,407
-I've been waiting
for this exact moment.

350
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:19,074
Gather and freeze, my minions.

351
00:21:19,107 --> 00:21:21,907
A cold greeting for
otherworldly guests.

352
00:21:21,941 --> 00:21:24,107
Shine white in all the darkness.

353
00:21:24,141 --> 00:21:27,041
Tremble in fear before
this freezing wind!

354
00:21:27,074 --> 00:21:28,507
Cursed blizzard.

355
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:29,474
Chilling wind!

356
00:21:35,907 --> 00:21:37,141
-I can see.

357
00:21:37,174 --> 00:21:39,107
My sight's back again.

358
00:21:44,607 --> 00:21:45,574
-Oh wow.

359
00:21:45,607 --> 00:21:47,074
I actually did it!

360
00:21:47,107 --> 00:21:48,074
Master Rikuo!

361
00:21:51,074 --> 00:21:52,541
-Not bad, Yuki Onna.

362
00:21:57,541 --> 00:22:02,474
Well, looks like it's
the beginning of act two.

363
00:22:08,422 --> 00:22:11,388
[theme music]

364
00:23:38,924 --> 00:23:39,945
KIYOTSUGU: Hey
Oikawa, What do you

365
00:23:39,945 --> 00:23:41,845
think of these Yokai
playing cards I designed?

366
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:43,011
TSURARA: Wow.

367
00:23:43,045 --> 00:23:44,645
It has all the Yokai's
power and techniques listed.

368
00:23:44,678 --> 00:23:46,878
KIYOTSUGU: I'm also planning
to add their age as well.

369
00:23:46,911 --> 00:23:49,111
TSURARA: I don't think you
need to write their age

370
00:23:49,145 --> 00:23:50,145
KIYOTSUGU: Huh?

371
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:52,845
NARRATOR: Next time,
The Devil's Blade.
