1
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,133
NARRATOR: In days of
old, people feared Yokai.

2
00:00:14,166 --> 00:00:18,533
The one who stood at the helm
and led the Night Parade of 100

3
00:00:18,566 --> 00:00:23,966
Demons was known as the
supreme commander of the Yokai.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
They had another name
for him, the Lord

5
00:00:27,033 --> 00:00:31,600
of Pandemonium, Nurarihyon.

6
00:00:31,633 --> 00:00:34,600
[theme music]

7
00:02:05,311 --> 00:02:07,745
NARRATOR: Rikuo awakens
to his Yokai form,

8
00:02:07,778 --> 00:02:10,478
rescuing his friends
from certain doom.

9
00:02:10,511 --> 00:02:13,211
But things were far from over.

10
00:02:13,245 --> 00:02:18,911
The premonition of danger
still lingered in the air.

11
00:02:18,945 --> 00:02:22,311
-So, you finally decided.

12
00:02:22,345 --> 00:02:26,978
-Then we will put our lives on
the line to fulfill your wish.

13
00:02:27,011 --> 00:02:29,911
The death of the third heir.

14
00:02:40,311 --> 00:02:43,878
GIRL: Red Plum Blossoms
on the Demon's Mountain.

15
00:02:53,311 --> 00:02:56,311
-Ienaga, I'm sorry.

16
00:02:56,345 --> 00:02:58,578
For putting you
through that nightmare.

17
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:01,345
If only I was stronger,
I could've protected you.

18
00:03:01,378 --> 00:03:02,278
-Mm-mm.

19
00:03:02,311 --> 00:03:04,078
It's not your fault, Yura.

20
00:03:04,111 --> 00:03:05,511
Don't worry about it.

21
00:03:05,545 --> 00:03:11,045
And besides, I was
definitely afraid of Yokai

22
00:03:11,078 --> 00:03:12,745
before, but that man.

23
00:03:20,011 --> 00:03:20,945
He was different.

24
00:03:20,978 --> 00:03:23,678
He was there to save us both.

25
00:03:23,711 --> 00:03:26,211
Maybe there are Yokai
who aren't scary.

26
00:03:26,245 --> 00:03:27,911
YURA (VOICEOVER):
Being saved by a Yokai.

27
00:03:27,945 --> 00:03:30,578
What a disgrace for an Onmyoji.

28
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:32,845
Some day, I will redeem myself.

29
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:35,145
-Oh, here you guys are!

30
00:03:35,178 --> 00:03:37,145
-Kiyotsugu just called.

31
00:03:37,178 --> 00:03:39,578
The Kiyojuji Paranomal
Patrol is having a meeting.

32
00:03:47,645 --> 00:03:48,411
-Good.

33
00:03:48,445 --> 00:03:49,711
Looks like everyone's here.

34
00:03:49,745 --> 00:03:51,811
I have a huge
announcement to make.

35
00:03:51,845 --> 00:03:53,445
-What sort of announcement?

36
00:03:53,478 --> 00:03:54,278
-What is it?

37
00:03:54,311 --> 00:03:55,045
Tell us.

38
00:03:55,078 --> 00:03:56,378
-You'll love this, guy's.

39
00:03:56,411 --> 00:04:00,111
This weekend, we, the Kiyojuji
Paranormal Patrol, will--

40
00:04:00,145 --> 00:04:01,111
-Huh?

41
00:04:01,145 --> 00:04:03,411
One of our members
seems to be missing.

42
00:04:03,445 --> 00:04:04,278
-Huh?

43
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:06,278
Where is Nura?

44
00:04:06,311 --> 00:04:06,778
-Huh?

45
00:04:06,811 --> 00:04:07,845
Master?

46
00:04:07,878 --> 00:04:09,178
Oh, my!

47
00:04:09,211 --> 00:04:12,211
Now that I think of it, I
haven't seen the Master all day

48
00:04:12,245 --> 00:04:13,845
today!

49
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:14,745
-It's so cold.

50
00:04:17,045 --> 00:04:19,011
-Natto Kozou, When you're
done with the laundry,

51
00:04:19,045 --> 00:04:21,178
gather some medicinal
herbs for the Master.

52
00:04:21,211 --> 00:04:22,345
-Gotcha.

53
00:04:22,378 --> 00:04:23,878
You go hurry and take
that water to the Master.

54
00:04:31,411 --> 00:04:33,378
-You still have a
pretty high fever.

55
00:04:33,411 --> 00:04:35,545
You should try and get
a little more sleep.

56
00:04:35,578 --> 00:04:37,178
-OK.

57
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:38,545
-I brought you some cold water.

58
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:39,411
-Thank you, Kubinashi.

59
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:47,278
-Hey, Zen.

60
00:04:59,078 --> 00:05:02,411
-I can't believe how pathetic
you are during the day.

61
00:05:02,445 --> 00:05:04,778
You overdo it a little
and you get a fever?

62
00:05:04,811 --> 00:05:05,678
-Look who's talking.

63
00:05:05,711 --> 00:05:09,311
You're more sickly than I am.

64
00:05:09,345 --> 00:05:11,678
-So, is it true that
you really don't

65
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:13,978
remember the fight you had?

66
00:05:14,011 --> 00:05:15,011
-Well, I, um--

67
00:05:29,645 --> 00:05:31,578
-That's too bad.

68
00:05:31,611 --> 00:05:33,478
I really want the
Rikuo that came out

69
00:05:33,511 --> 00:05:35,078
that night to become
the third heir.

70
00:05:47,478 --> 00:05:48,645
I'm going now.

71
00:05:48,678 --> 00:05:50,011
Take care, Rikuo.

72
00:05:50,045 --> 00:05:50,978
-Master!

73
00:05:51,011 --> 00:05:51,978
I'm so sorry.

74
00:05:52,011 --> 00:05:54,278
I'm supposed to be
your closest aid,

75
00:05:54,311 --> 00:05:56,778
and yet I didn't notice that
you never came to school today.

76
00:05:56,811 --> 00:05:59,645
I spent the whole day
completely unaware!

77
00:05:59,678 --> 00:06:03,478
Punish me in whatever
way you see fit.

78
00:06:03,511 --> 00:06:05,978
[screaming]

79
00:06:10,045 --> 00:06:14,745
-I believe that Kyuso was hired
by someone to cause this mess.

80
00:06:14,778 --> 00:06:17,611
Someone who definitely
does not want Master Rikuo

81
00:06:17,645 --> 00:06:19,678
to become the third heir.

82
00:06:19,711 --> 00:06:23,711
-It's well known that Rikuo has
reawakened as a Yokai again.

83
00:06:23,745 --> 00:06:25,811
It must be someone
who is not pleased

84
00:06:25,845 --> 00:06:27,711
with the new development.

85
00:06:27,745 --> 00:06:29,578
-Gyuki, what do you think?

86
00:06:36,278 --> 00:06:38,378
-The Master thoroughly
defeated Kyuso.

87
00:06:38,411 --> 00:06:41,011
There is no doubting his
formidable skills as a Yokai.

88
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:47,511
However, the simple fact
remains that he can only

89
00:06:47,545 --> 00:06:49,911
maintain that state for
a quarter of the day

90
00:06:49,945 --> 00:06:51,745
at the very most.

91
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:54,378
We must wait and
see how he develops.

92
00:06:54,411 --> 00:06:56,945
For now, we should
talk about this matter

93
00:06:56,978 --> 00:06:59,245
slowly and carefully.

94
00:06:59,278 --> 00:07:00,045
-Hmph.

95
00:07:00,078 --> 00:07:04,011
Acting all goody goody, huh?

96
00:07:04,045 --> 00:07:05,078
-This'll do the trick.

97
00:07:05,111 --> 00:07:06,711
It's my special ice compress.

98
00:07:06,745 --> 00:07:08,811
It'll make your
fever go away fast.

99
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:11,111
Now I'm gonna get you some
medicine, so just relax 'til

100
00:07:11,145 --> 00:07:13,945
I get back.

101
00:07:13,978 --> 00:07:16,178
-It's heavy.

102
00:07:16,211 --> 00:07:18,211
Tsurara, There's
way too much ice.

103
00:07:18,245 --> 00:07:20,778
Can you melt it
down a little bit?

104
00:07:20,811 --> 00:07:21,278
KANA: Huh?

105
00:07:21,311 --> 00:07:21,778
Tsurara?

106
00:07:21,811 --> 00:07:22,411
-Huh?

107
00:07:22,445 --> 00:07:23,778
Kana!

108
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:24,878
-Ienaga isn't alone.

109
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:27,011
We all decided to come too!

110
00:07:27,045 --> 00:07:27,545
-Hey there.

111
00:07:27,578 --> 00:07:28,060
-Hello.

112
00:07:28,093 --> 00:07:28,778
-Hello.

113
00:07:28,811 --> 00:07:30,945
-Why are you guys all here?

114
00:07:30,978 --> 00:07:32,511
-Well, isn't that obvious?

115
00:07:32,545 --> 00:07:35,311
We came to see how
you're feeling, Nura.

116
00:07:35,345 --> 00:07:36,111
You're pathetic.

117
00:07:36,145 --> 00:07:38,078
Only fools catch cold.

118
00:07:38,111 --> 00:07:41,011
-Well, I guess
I'll excuse myself.

119
00:07:41,045 --> 00:07:42,278
-Thank you, Miss Housekeeper.

120
00:07:42,311 --> 00:07:42,778
Goodbye.

121
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:49,611
-Say, Rikuo, did you just
mistake me for someone else?

122
00:07:49,645 --> 00:07:50,245
-Huh?

123
00:07:50,278 --> 00:07:51,078
What do you mean?

124
00:07:51,111 --> 00:07:53,245
I think you called me Tsurara.

125
00:07:53,278 --> 00:07:54,878
-Oh, are you all right, Rikuo?

126
00:07:54,911 --> 00:07:56,045
Have you taken any medicine?

127
00:07:56,078 --> 00:07:57,011
-No, not yet.

128
00:07:57,045 --> 00:07:58,178
-Wait right here and relxas.

129
00:07:58,211 --> 00:07:59,478
I'll go get some for you.

130
00:07:59,511 --> 00:08:01,645
If I'm not mistaken, the
kitchen is this way, right?

131
00:08:01,678 --> 00:08:02,878
I'll be back in a minute.

132
00:08:02,911 --> 00:08:04,445
-No, Kana, wait a second.

133
00:08:08,111 --> 00:08:10,178
-Uh, Oikawa?

134
00:08:10,211 --> 00:08:11,545
-Ienaga?

135
00:08:11,578 --> 00:08:12,445
-Huh?

136
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:15,578
-W--what are you doing here?

137
00:08:15,611 --> 00:08:17,378
TSURARA (VOICEOVER):
Calm down, Yuki Onna.

138
00:08:17,411 --> 00:08:21,111
Don't even think about
freezing them and wiping them

139
00:08:21,145 --> 00:08:22,411
of the face of the earth.

140
00:08:26,578 --> 00:08:29,711
-Uh, well, you see,
she's just here to--

141
00:08:29,745 --> 00:08:30,878
-I get it.

142
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:32,778
You decided to come
visit and got here first.

143
00:08:32,811 --> 00:08:34,645
-Yeah, yeah, that's it.

144
00:08:34,678 --> 00:08:37,311
She got here just before
you about 10 minutes ago.

145
00:08:37,345 --> 00:08:39,145
-Yeah, that's right, I did!

146
00:08:39,178 --> 00:08:40,278
Ha ha!

147
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:40,945
OK.

148
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:43,078
Please get up now.

149
00:08:43,111 --> 00:08:44,811
-Oikawa?

150
00:08:44,845 --> 00:08:45,411
-Open wide.

151
00:08:48,378 --> 00:08:49,211
-Thanks, Tsurara.

152
00:08:49,245 --> 00:08:50,445
-No problem.

153
00:08:53,778 --> 00:08:55,045
-I was right, then.

154
00:08:55,078 --> 00:08:57,011
You did say Tsurara.

155
00:08:57,045 --> 00:08:59,078
-OK, enough with
the nursemaid stuff.

156
00:08:59,111 --> 00:09:01,678
Now that the Kiyojuji Paranormal
Patrol is all together

157
00:09:01,711 --> 00:09:05,045
in one place, I want to announce
this weekend's big, exciting

158
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:05,911
schedule.

159
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:07,078
-This weekend?

160
00:09:07,111 --> 00:09:08,178
-Yes.

161
00:09:08,211 --> 00:09:09,511
You probably don't have
plans anyway, right?

162
00:09:09,545 --> 00:09:11,945
Unlike me, who's so busy.

163
00:09:11,978 --> 00:09:14,945
I've been in touch with an
expert on all things Yokai,

164
00:09:14,978 --> 00:09:16,978
and we're gonna have the
privilege of meeting him

165
00:09:17,011 --> 00:09:18,078
this weekend.

166
00:09:18,111 --> 00:09:18,911
-Huh?

167
00:09:18,945 --> 00:09:20,745
-Re you serious?

168
00:09:20,778 --> 00:09:23,511
-And this Yokai expert has even
reserved rooms for all of us

169
00:09:23,545 --> 00:09:25,178
at a wonderful inn.

170
00:09:25,211 --> 00:09:27,478
A Yokai adventure!

171
00:09:27,511 --> 00:09:30,378
-A what?

172
00:09:30,411 --> 00:09:31,511
Should we go?

173
00:09:31,545 --> 00:09:33,278
-I'm free this weekend,
so I don't mind going.

174
00:09:33,311 --> 00:09:35,611
Kana?

175
00:09:35,645 --> 00:09:36,645
-Me?

176
00:09:36,678 --> 00:09:38,111
I, um--

177
00:09:38,743 --> 00:09:40,309
-Well, it sounds to
me like it's going

178
00:09:40,343 --> 00:09:41,776
to be a fun little outing.

179
00:09:41,809 --> 00:09:44,509
Of course you're going
too, right Rikuo?

180
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:45,209
-Mm-hm.

181
00:09:45,243 --> 00:09:47,209
If my fever goes down.

182
00:09:47,243 --> 00:09:48,043
-Huh?

183
00:09:48,076 --> 00:09:49,243
All right!

184
00:09:49,276 --> 00:09:51,043
Yura has already
agreed to join me,

185
00:09:51,076 --> 00:09:53,543
and I'm also counting
Nura and Oikawa in!

186
00:09:53,576 --> 00:09:54,309
-I'll go too.

187
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:57,043
-Yeah, I'll be going too.

188
00:09:57,076 --> 00:09:57,776
-What do you say?

189
00:09:57,809 --> 00:09:59,043
You wanna go to?

190
00:09:59,076 --> 00:09:59,976
-Yeah, let's go.

191
00:10:00,009 --> 00:10:01,676
-OK, then we're set.

192
00:10:01,709 --> 00:10:05,309
We'll be meeting our Yokai
expert at Ume Rakuen Garden.

193
00:10:05,343 --> 00:10:07,676
That's where the Kiyojuji
paranormal patrol

194
00:10:07,709 --> 00:10:10,976
will go for its first
Yokai field trip!

195
00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:12,909
-I guess it's OK.

196
00:10:15,843 --> 00:10:16,943
-Ume Rakuen, huh?

197
00:10:31,276 --> 00:10:32,276
-Hey, Karasu Tengu.

198
00:10:34,943 --> 00:10:36,043
-Yes?

199
00:10:36,076 --> 00:10:37,676
-Go look into our
clan roster to see

200
00:10:37,709 --> 00:10:40,343
if anyone was in
contact with Kyuso.

201
00:10:40,376 --> 00:10:43,943
-You think there's
a traitor among us?

202
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,309
Very well, sir.

203
00:10:45,343 --> 00:10:49,143
Then I'll dispatch my foolhardy
sons, the Sanba Garasu,

204
00:10:49,176 --> 00:10:50,643
to investigate all this.

205
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:55,143
-I wonder what will turn up.

206
00:10:55,176 --> 00:10:56,776
A demon or a snake.

207
00:10:56,809 --> 00:10:58,543
[gurgling]

208
00:10:58,576 --> 00:10:59,309
Now then.

209
00:10:59,343 --> 00:11:00,576
I'm feeling a bit hungry.

210
00:11:00,609 --> 00:11:03,376
I think I'll go find some
place I can eat for free.

211
00:11:25,417 --> 00:11:28,817
-Rikuo and Oikawa.

212
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:31,250
Those two seemed really close.

213
00:11:40,184 --> 00:11:42,017
What am I thinking?

214
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:46,584
[phone ringing]

215
00:11:46,617 --> 00:11:48,817
-Rikuo?

216
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:49,384
Hello?

217
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,417
This is Kana.

218
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:53,284
-Um, about the
field trip tomorrow.

219
00:11:53,317 --> 00:11:56,417
What would a normal girl usually
take to something like that?

220
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:57,784
-What do you mean by normal?

221
00:11:57,817 --> 00:12:00,817
I mean, why do you need to know
something like that, Rikuo?

222
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,117
-Oh, uh, well--

223
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:07,317
-Not that it really matters.

224
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,350
-Let's see.

225
00:12:08,384 --> 00:12:10,350
A change of clothes,
some night cream.

226
00:12:10,384 --> 00:12:12,017
-Yeah, OK.

227
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:13,750
anything else?

228
00:12:13,784 --> 00:12:14,717
-Hey, Master Rikuo.

229
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,184
Who are you talking
to over there?

230
00:12:16,217 --> 00:12:17,484
-Uh, Rikuo.

231
00:12:17,517 --> 00:12:19,884
That wasn't Oikawa's voice
I just heard, was it?

232
00:12:19,917 --> 00:12:21,150
RIKUO (ON PHONE): Oh, no!

233
00:12:21,184 --> 00:12:24,017
That was, um, uh,
just my mom talking.

234
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:24,984
Thanks a lot.

235
00:12:25,017 --> 00:12:25,950
See you tomorrow.

236
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:31,750
-Here.

237
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:33,150
I hope this will
be enough for you.

238
00:12:33,184 --> 00:12:35,450
-Thank you, Lady Wakana!

239
00:12:35,484 --> 00:12:36,517
-By the way.

240
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,984
Where are you all going
for this field trip?

241
00:12:38,017 --> 00:12:39,817
-Some place called Ume Rakuen.

242
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:42,084
-Doesn't it sounds like it's
going to be a lot of fun?

243
00:12:42,117 --> 00:12:44,384
-Ume Rakuen?

244
00:12:44,417 --> 00:12:46,017
-Have you been there before?

245
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:48,284
-Mm-mm.

246
00:12:48,317 --> 00:12:51,117
But I think I've heard
the name somewhere.

247
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,517
I'm sure was nothing.

248
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,984
Anyway, have fun, you two.

249
00:12:54,017 --> 00:12:54,484
-OK!

250
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:14,084
-Good.

251
00:13:14,117 --> 00:13:14,884
Now then.

252
00:13:14,917 --> 00:13:16,417
Is everybody ready to do this?

253
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:17,884
-Mm-hm.

254
00:13:17,917 --> 00:13:19,184
-Right then, let's do.

255
00:13:19,217 --> 00:13:22,017
Ready, set!

256
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:25,684
Dammit, it's Natto Kozou again!

257
00:13:25,717 --> 00:13:27,484
-Man, Nura won again.

258
00:13:27,517 --> 00:13:29,917
You've got an awful lot of
luck with Yokai, don't you?

259
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:31,950
How can anyone win
20 consecutive times

260
00:13:31,984 --> 00:13:33,784
in Yokai poker?

261
00:13:33,817 --> 00:13:35,950
It's just sheer
coincidence, really.

262
00:13:35,984 --> 00:13:37,284
Oh!

263
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,350
Master is the future leader
of all the Yokai after all.

264
00:13:39,384 --> 00:13:42,550
Even in a Yokai card game,
he naturally takes the lead.

265
00:13:42,584 --> 00:13:46,384
KANA (VOICEOVER): There she goes
again, giving Rikuo that look.

266
00:13:46,417 --> 00:13:49,250
What's the deal between them?

267
00:13:49,284 --> 00:13:52,323
-Are there really
Yokai at Ume Rakuen?

268
00:13:56,684 --> 00:13:57,650
-Master.

269
00:13:57,684 --> 00:13:59,550
I, Aotabo, will
accompany you everywhere

270
00:13:59,584 --> 00:14:01,417
you go to the ends of the Earth.

271
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:09,450
-How many times do we
have to transfer trains?

272
00:14:09,484 --> 00:14:12,850
-My back hurts.

273
00:14:12,884 --> 00:14:13,917
-OK, everyone!

274
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:14,617
Take a look.

275
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:15,617
There's our destination.

276
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:19,450
-Wow.

277
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:20,850
The plum blossoms
are still in bloom.

278
00:14:20,884 --> 00:14:21,950
SAORI: It's beautiful.

279
00:14:21,984 --> 00:14:23,550
-I thought that this
was gonna be a garden,

280
00:14:23,584 --> 00:14:24,717
but it's a mountain.

281
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,650
-All right now.

282
00:14:25,684 --> 00:14:26,884
Don't worry about
the small stuff.

283
00:14:26,917 --> 00:14:28,017
Let's go.

284
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:29,684
First we're meeting up
with a Yokai professor

285
00:14:29,717 --> 00:14:31,217
at Umewakamaru Shrine!

286
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,117
-A shrine?

287
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:32,950
-Which way is it?

288
00:14:32,984 --> 00:14:34,084
-I don't know.

289
00:14:34,117 --> 00:14:35,584
We're just gonna have to
find it for ourselves.

290
00:14:35,617 --> 00:14:37,384
It's somewhere on this mountain.

291
00:14:37,417 --> 00:14:38,417
-What?

292
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:40,017
We have to search
the whole mountain?

293
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:42,684
[sigh]

294
00:14:42,717 --> 00:14:47,850
-I don't sense any Yokai energy,
but I can't let my guard down.

295
00:14:47,884 --> 00:14:48,950
-Oikawa!

296
00:14:48,984 --> 00:14:50,450
You want me to carry
your backpack for you?

297
00:14:50,484 --> 00:14:51,450
-No, it's all right.

298
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:01,984
Wow, it's beautiful.

299
00:15:02,017 --> 00:15:03,684
It's almost like a
paradise, isn't it?

300
00:15:03,717 --> 00:15:05,517
I'm so glad we came.

301
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:07,884
Well, let's get going, shall we?

302
00:15:24,084 --> 00:15:24,984
-Oh, man.

303
00:15:25,017 --> 00:15:26,884
It's all mountain.

304
00:15:26,917 --> 00:15:28,217
-My feet hurt.

305
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,350
Are you sure this is
the meeting place?

306
00:15:30,384 --> 00:15:31,350
-Yeah.

307
00:15:31,384 --> 00:15:32,884
There doesn't seem
to be anyone here.

308
00:15:32,917 --> 00:15:34,550
-Oh, come on, don't
be stupid, Shima.

309
00:15:34,584 --> 00:15:37,084
It's because there aren't
people here that Yokai appear,

310
00:15:37,117 --> 00:15:37,650
probably.

311
00:15:37,684 --> 00:15:39,217
-Probably, huh?

312
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,517
-I'd rather they didn't appear.

313
00:15:43,384 --> 00:15:43,917
-Master?

314
00:15:47,984 --> 00:15:49,550
-Hey, what is that over here?

315
00:15:49,584 --> 00:15:51,317
-What are you talking about?

316
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:55,317
-It's a small shrine, and
I think a jizo statue.

317
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:56,350
-Where?

318
00:15:56,384 --> 00:15:58,884
-It's hard to see
from here, but there's

319
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:02,150
something written on it,
I'll go and check it out.

320
00:16:02,184 --> 00:16:03,017
-It says Umewakamaru.

321
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,384
-How can you see that?

322
00:16:13,917 --> 00:16:15,017
-Well, Miss Keikain?

323
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:15,584
-Wow.

324
00:16:15,617 --> 00:16:16,684
You're right.

325
00:16:16,717 --> 00:16:17,950
-This is the shrine
we've been looking for!

326
00:16:17,984 --> 00:16:19,384
Isn't it great?

327
00:16:19,417 --> 00:16:20,817
We did it, Yura!

328
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:22,250
-Is that--

329
00:16:22,284 --> 00:16:23,450
-Yes, I'm afraid so.

330
00:16:23,484 --> 00:16:26,484
this mountain really may
have some lurking about.

331
00:16:26,517 --> 00:16:28,784
YURA (VOICEOVER): I
feel something ominous.

332
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,050
-Who's that filthy looking man?

333
00:16:55,084 --> 00:16:56,117
-Don't be stupid.

334
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:58,017
He's the writer and
Yokai researcher,

335
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,750
Professor Adashibara.

336
00:16:59,784 --> 00:17:02,284
-Hey, you guys found
the Umewakamaru shrine

337
00:17:02,317 --> 00:17:03,484
pretty quickly.

338
00:17:03,517 --> 00:17:06,917
Good job, Kiyojuji
paranormal patrol.

339
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:08,550
-I'm very honored to meet you.

340
00:17:08,584 --> 00:17:09,850
-Yes.

341
00:17:09,884 --> 00:17:13,717
Um, who is this Umewakamaru
that's enshrined here?

342
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,117
-Umewakamaru is the hero
of the ancient Yokai

343
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:19,650
legend about this mountain and
the creatures who inhabit it.

344
00:17:19,684 --> 00:17:20,784
-A Yokai legend?

345
00:17:20,817 --> 00:17:21,784
-Follow me.

346
00:17:24,984 --> 00:17:28,650
-Would you mind repeating
that, my foolhardy sons?

347
00:17:28,684 --> 00:17:31,150
-It's just deciding, that's all.

348
00:17:31,184 --> 00:17:33,684
It doesn't mean he's
behind all this yet.

349
00:17:33,717 --> 00:17:37,084
But the crows of Ukiyoe
Town were watching.

350
00:17:37,117 --> 00:17:37,684
-I see.

351
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:18,517
-What is that?

352
00:18:24,117 --> 00:18:25,650
What is all this?

353
00:18:25,684 --> 00:18:26,984
-Those, miss, are claws.

354
00:18:27,017 --> 00:18:28,484
-Claws?

355
00:18:28,517 --> 00:18:31,584
-The Yokai live right up
here on this mountain.

356
00:18:31,617 --> 00:18:34,317
You can't let a mere
torn off claw scare you.

357
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:34,817
-Yes!

358
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,057
I knew it.

359
00:18:36,057 --> 00:18:38,491
I knew this mountain
would have Yokai on it.

360
00:18:38,524 --> 00:18:39,182
-Oh no.

361
00:18:39,182 --> 00:18:41,915
What are we gonna do
if one really appears?

362
00:18:41,948 --> 00:18:45,701
-And the best part is that the
hero of this mountain's Yokai

363
00:18:45,735 --> 00:18:48,135
legend, Umewakamaru is up there.

364
00:18:54,268 --> 00:18:59,101
-I simply can't believe that
he would actually do that.

365
00:18:59,135 --> 00:19:01,668
-Rikuo isn't coming home today?

366
00:19:01,701 --> 00:19:04,568
-No, he's gone on an
outing with his club.

367
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:07,201
-Karasu Tengu, why don't
you join me for some tea?

368
00:19:10,635 --> 00:19:11,335
-Yes.

369
00:19:11,368 --> 00:19:12,368
I'd really like that.

370
00:19:17,968 --> 00:19:21,001
-So, where did Rikuo
and his friends go?

371
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:25,001
-He said they were all
going to Ume Rakuen.

372
00:19:25,035 --> 00:19:27,001
-They went to Ume Rakuen, eh?

373
00:19:27,035 --> 00:19:29,135
Well, I think that's
a great place.

374
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,535
-Oh, so you've
been there before?

375
00:19:31,568 --> 00:19:32,668
-But Supreme Commander.

376
00:19:32,701 --> 00:19:34,768
That mountain is-- No,
no I can't linger here.

377
00:19:34,801 --> 00:19:35,468
-Hey!

378
00:19:35,501 --> 00:19:36,868
Foolhardy sons of mine!

379
00:19:46,868 --> 00:19:47,335
-Master.

380
00:19:50,968 --> 00:19:55,535
-See, many ages ago, Ume Rakuen
was known by another name.

381
00:19:55,568 --> 00:19:56,901
-Why was that?

382
00:19:56,935 --> 00:20:00,135
-People believed that a Yokai
who attacks lost travelers

383
00:20:00,168 --> 00:20:01,668
lived on this mountain.

384
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:04,101
The rumors spread, and
pretty soon, people

385
00:20:04,135 --> 00:20:06,035
began to avoid the area.

386
00:20:06,068 --> 00:20:08,668
In order to quell all the
fear and put the rumor

387
00:20:08,701 --> 00:20:11,435
to rest once and for all,
the hopeful residents

388
00:20:11,468 --> 00:20:15,468
began calling this place a
paradise of plum blossoms.

389
00:20:15,501 --> 00:20:18,535
Its original name was Mt.

390
00:20:18,568 --> 00:20:19,035
Nejireme.

391
00:20:23,301 --> 00:20:23,835
-Master.

392
00:20:23,868 --> 00:20:24,668
That means--

393
00:20:24,701 --> 00:20:25,435
-That's right.

394
00:20:25,468 --> 00:20:26,535
The Yokai who lives on Mt.

395
00:20:26,568 --> 00:20:28,168
Nejireme is him.

396
00:20:33,035 --> 00:20:33,901
It's Gyuki.

397
00:20:49,401 --> 00:20:51,368
-The prey has come
to the mountain.

398
00:21:01,835 --> 00:21:04,635
-I knew I had heard
of Ume Rakuen before.

399
00:21:04,668 --> 00:21:06,601
I just hadn't made
the connection.

400
00:21:06,635 --> 00:21:07,801
I've always known it as Mt.

401
00:21:07,835 --> 00:21:10,568
Nejireme, the mountain
where Gyuki lives.

402
00:21:10,601 --> 00:21:14,568
I hope Gyuki will be happy
to see Rikuo and his friends.

403
00:21:14,601 --> 00:21:17,001
-I'm most certain that he will
warmly welcome all of them.

404
00:21:22,835 --> 00:21:25,635
-So, it seems it was Gyuki
who was manipulating Kyuso

405
00:21:25,668 --> 00:21:26,601
after all.

406
00:21:30,335 --> 00:21:32,735
I'll just sit back
and watch you at work.

407
00:21:53,035 --> 00:21:55,201
-Master.

408
00:21:55,235 --> 00:21:55,768
NARRATOR: Mt.

409
00:21:55,801 --> 00:21:56,701
Nejireme.

410
00:21:56,735 --> 00:21:59,335
A dark, mysterious
mountain where

411
00:21:59,368 --> 00:22:02,435
a frightening Yokai who devours
lost travellers resides.

412
00:22:08,897 --> 00:22:11,763
[theme music]

413
00:23:38,771 --> 00:23:40,938
MAN: You're standing out
from the other students, Ao.

414
00:23:40,971 --> 00:23:42,038
AOTABO: Why?

415
00:23:42,071 --> 00:23:43,605
I'm dressed like any
middle schools would be.

416
00:23:43,638 --> 00:23:46,471
MAN: Actually, I think
I'd look better in it.

417
00:23:46,505 --> 00:23:48,605
AOTABO: Wait, you wanna
wear a school uniform?

418
00:23:48,638 --> 00:23:49,938
MAN: Uh--

419
00:23:49,971 --> 00:23:53,138
NARRATOR: Next time, A Trap
is Set on the Evil Mountain.
