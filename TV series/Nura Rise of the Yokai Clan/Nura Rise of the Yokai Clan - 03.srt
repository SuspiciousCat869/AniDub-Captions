NARRATOR: In days of
old, people feared yokai.

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,200
The one who stood at the
helm and led the night

4
00:00:16,233 --> 00:00:18,866
parade of a hundred
demons was known

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,933
as the Supreme
Commander of the Yokai.

6
00:00:22,966 --> 00:00:26,066
They had another name
for him, the Lord

7
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:31,066
of Pandemonium, Nurarihyon.

NARRATOR: A frightful scream
pierces through the dark night.

13
00:02:45,913 --> 00:02:49,146
Who is this ominous
shadow that feasts

14
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,713
on these cries of terror?

15

YUKI ONNA: "Yura Keikain and
the Kiyojuji Paranormal Patrol."

16
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:02,046
-All right, everyone.

17
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,980
Here's a yokai quiz for you.

18
00:03:05,013 --> 00:03:06,880
Which one of the
following fire yokai

19
00:03:06,913 --> 00:03:09,113
can fly and control birds?

20
00:03:09,146 --> 00:03:10,346
A, Tsurubebi?

21
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,546
B, Furaribi?

22
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,980
C, Ubagabi.

23
00:03:13,013 --> 00:03:15,213
-It's C, ubagabi.

24
00:03:15,246 --> 00:03:16,146
KIYOTSUGU: Wrong.

25
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:19,013
The correct answer
is B, Furaribi.

26
00:03:19,046 --> 00:03:22,013
You still have a
lot to learn, Shima.

27
00:03:22,046 --> 00:03:24,946
Oh, and by the way, it is said
that these fire yokai make up

28
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,813
one third of the entire yokai.

29
00:03:26,846 --> 00:03:28,513
Do you know what their goal is?

30
00:03:28,546 --> 00:03:32,446
-To invoke fear in
the hearts of man.

31
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,646
-You seem to know an awful
lot about them newbie.

32
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,913
What was your name?

33
00:03:38,946 --> 00:03:41,713
-My name is Yura Keikain.

34
00:03:41,746 --> 00:03:45,446
Just so you know, animals
that have turned into yokai

35
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,913
are said to be the most
hostile of them all.

36
00:03:47,946 --> 00:03:51,613
Many of them are intelligent,
but they have no rationality.

37
00:03:51,646 --> 00:03:54,146
These traits make them
extremely dangerous.

38
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,446
-Whoa.

39
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,780
-Amazing.

40
00:03:56,813 --> 00:03:59,080
-You know a lot about
yokai, Miss Keikain.

41
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:01,980
-Thank you, but you
can call me Yura.

42
00:04:02,013 --> 00:04:03,446
NATSUMI: How did
you know all that?

43
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,780
RIKUO (VOICEOVER): Is that
girl a yokai fanatic too?

44
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:09,980
-Sounds like you've done a lot
of research on yokai, Yura.

45
00:04:10,013 --> 00:04:11,413
-Yes, I suppose.

46
00:04:11,446 --> 00:04:14,013
It's important to note
that these animals turned

47
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:16,846
yokai will always follow their
primal instincts to deceive,

48
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,946
curse, attack, and devour
humans as they please.

49
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,880
So you should always
make it a point

50
00:04:21,913 --> 00:04:23,980
to avoid them at all costs.

51
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,380
-OK.

52
00:04:25,413 --> 00:04:26,913
-You are fantastic.

53
00:04:26,946 --> 00:04:29,813
I've been looking forever
for someone just like you.

54
00:04:29,846 --> 00:04:32,580
Please you have to join the
Kiyojuji Paranormal Patrol.

55
00:04:32,613 --> 00:04:34,280
I insist.

56
00:04:34,313 --> 00:04:37,180
-What's the Kiyojuji
Paranormal Patrol?

57
00:04:37,213 --> 00:04:39,213
-It's a group that I
just recently started.

58
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:41,746
Our main activity is
to search for yokai.

59
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,013
-Nura, don't worry.

60
00:04:43,046 --> 00:04:44,780
You're already one
of our members.

61
00:04:44,813 --> 00:04:46,146
-What?

62
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,746
-Naturally, the same
goes for you Ienaga.

63
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,346
And by the way,
newbie, I mean Yura,

64
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,780
we're going to celebrate the
formation of the Kiyojuji

65
00:04:54,813 --> 00:04:55,980
Paranormal Patrol.

66
00:04:56,013 --> 00:04:58,646
Interested in joining us?

67
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,346
I was thinking it
would be a good idea

68
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:03,180
if we held a ceremony
over at Nura's house.

69
00:05:03,213 --> 00:05:05,113
-Wha-- what do
you mean my house?

70
00:05:05,146 --> 00:05:08,480
-Well, I heard your
house is very, very old.

71
00:05:08,513 --> 00:05:10,280
And according to all
the rumors I've heard,

72
00:05:10,313 --> 00:05:13,313
the neighbors think your
place is teeming with yokai.

73
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:16,480
-Teeming with yokai, huh?

74
00:05:16,513 --> 00:05:17,480
-No way.

75
00:05:17,513 --> 00:05:19,446
I've never heard
rumors like that.

76
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,546
-No.

77
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,380
Sorry, but my information
is quite reliable.

78
00:05:22,413 --> 00:05:22,880
-Yep.

79
00:05:22,913 --> 00:05:23,946
It is.

80
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,080
KIYOTSUGU: It's settled.

81
00:05:25,113 --> 00:05:26,946
Tonight, the Kiyojuji
Paranormal Patrol

82
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,346
will have its first
gathering at Nura's house.

83
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,446
SHIMA: OK, boss.

84
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,913
Whatever you say.

85
00:05:32,946 --> 00:05:34,380
-Wait a second.

86
00:05:34,413 --> 00:05:36,446
-Well, if that's the
case, then I'll go too.

87
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,446
-What?

88
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,946
-You know your house
really does look

89
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,913
a lot like a
haunted house, Nura.

90
00:05:40,946 --> 00:05:43,246
It sounds like it
could be a lot of fun.

91
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,180
-If what Kana says
is true, then I

92
00:05:45,213 --> 00:05:46,846
think I'll be
joining you as well.

93
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,113
-Huh?

94
00:05:48,146 --> 00:05:49,846
-It looks like
master's gotten himself

95
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,613
into another tricky situation.

96
00:05:51,646 --> 00:05:52,113
-Yeah.

97
00:05:58,913 --> 00:06:01,813
[groan]

98
00:06:01,846 --> 00:06:03,346
-What should I do?

99
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:06,046
Everyone is coming
over to my house.

100
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,780
-Don't worry.

101
00:06:06,813 --> 00:06:08,146
It'll be all right, master.

102
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,346
We'll make sure to let
everyone know that they're

103
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,880
going to need to keep things
really quiet around the house

104
00:06:12,913 --> 00:06:13,980
tonight while they're there.

105
00:06:14,013 --> 00:06:14,746
-Mhm.

106
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,246
-What about Miss Keikain?

107
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,880
She seems to know
a lot about yokai.

108
00:06:18,913 --> 00:06:20,413
She worries me.

109
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:21,646
-You have a point.

110
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,213
I'm a bit concerned
her about myself.

111
00:06:24,246 --> 00:06:27,080
She seems to have a
strange aura around her.

112
00:06:27,113 --> 00:06:28,446
-You think so?

113
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,313
[laughter]

114
00:06:31,346 --> 00:06:32,913
-What's that noise?

115
00:06:32,946 --> 00:06:34,880
-It sounds like it's
coming from the house.

116
00:06:34,913 --> 00:06:37,013
-I just can't believe
how big a ruckus

117
00:06:37,046 --> 00:06:39,046
they're making at
this time of the day.

118
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:39,813
-No!

119
00:06:39,846 --> 00:06:41,546
We have to make them stop.

120
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,746
I need them to stay quiet.

121
00:06:57,746 --> 00:06:59,680
-[laughing] Come on, everyone.

122
00:06:59,713 --> 00:07:01,146
Drink up.

123
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:04,646
-You drink too, Natto.

124
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,646
-How about some
more sake over here?

125
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,180
-All right.

126
00:07:07,213 --> 00:07:08,413
Here you go.

127
00:07:08,446 --> 00:07:09,480
-Oh dear.

128
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:10,846
Looks like we're going
to need more sake.

129
00:07:13,446 --> 00:07:17,713
-Everyone, what the
heck is going on here?

130
00:07:17,746 --> 00:07:20,046
-Why, if it isn't Master Rikuo.

131
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,046
-Welcome home, Master Rikuo.

132
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,846
-We've been waiting
for you to arrive.

133
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,713
Tonight, your loyal
yokai have gathered

134
00:07:25,746 --> 00:07:27,846
to drink sake in your honor.

135
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,346
-In my honor?

136
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,046
-Yes.

137
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,346
That's right, master.

138
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,646
We all heard that you made
a magnificent transformation

139
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,646
last night.

140
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,980
-It definitely calls
for a celebration.

141
00:07:37,013 --> 00:07:38,146
-Come on now, master.

142
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,413
It's almost nighttime.

143
00:07:39,446 --> 00:07:40,346
Please.

144
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,513
We all want to
see you transform,

145
00:07:41,546 --> 00:07:42,813
just like you did last night.

146
00:07:42,846 --> 00:07:43,313
-Yeah.

147
00:07:43,346 --> 00:07:44,446
Show us.

148
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,046
-But I don't want
to transform again.

149
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,280
Never mind that.

150
00:07:48,313 --> 00:07:50,013
You've got to hide right away.

151
00:07:50,046 --> 00:07:54,213
My friends from school
are coming over tonight.

152
00:07:54,246 --> 00:07:57,013
-Master, did you just say
your friends are coming over?

153
00:07:57,046 --> 00:07:58,046
-Yeah.

154
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,213
That's right, and
they can't find out

155
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:00,746
that yokai are
living in my house,

156
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,346
or I'll be in big trouble.

157
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,613
-You heard him, guys.

158
00:08:03,646 --> 00:08:04,813
Please cooperate.

159
00:08:04,846 --> 00:08:07,046
-We have to do this
for the master.

160
00:08:11,013 --> 00:08:14,980
-We were all so excited
to have a big sake party.

161
00:08:15,013 --> 00:08:16,280
-Now, now.

162
00:08:16,313 --> 00:08:18,480
We're just going to have to
celebrate some other time.

163
00:08:20,946 --> 00:08:21,913
-Look.

164
00:08:21,946 --> 00:08:23,513
I'm sorry, everybody,
but I just don't

165
00:08:23,546 --> 00:08:25,646
want any of my friends
to find out about us.

166
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,946
That's all.

167
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,646
KIYOTSUGU: Hey, Nura.

168
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,880
We're all here.

169
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:34,813
-They're here.

170
00:08:38,113 --> 00:08:39,880
-Hey, how you doing, Nura?

171
00:08:39,913 --> 00:08:42,213
Thanks for inviting
us over tonight.

172
00:08:42,246 --> 00:08:44,446
-I didn't really invite you.

173
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,480
-Are these your friends, Rikuo?

174
00:08:46,513 --> 00:08:48,746
It's a very nice
to meet all of you.

175
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,780
This is wonderful,
because it's very rare

176
00:08:50,813 --> 00:08:52,846
that we have human visitors.

177
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,413
-Human visitors?

178
00:08:54,446 --> 00:08:55,113
-Uh.

179
00:08:55,146 --> 00:08:56,146
Come on in, everybody.

180
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:56,680
Come in.

181
00:08:56,713 --> 00:08:57,380
Come on in.

182
00:08:57,413 --> 00:08:57,946
EVERYBODY: Thank you.

183
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,046
-This house piques my interest.

184
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,446
It's quite common for yokai to
prefer living in old mansions

185
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,880
just like this one.

186
00:09:07,913 --> 00:09:08,446
-Oh yeah?

187
00:09:18,946 --> 00:09:19,713
-Wow.

188
00:09:19,746 --> 00:09:21,213
This place is enormous.

189
00:09:21,246 --> 00:09:22,346
-Yeah.

190
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,113
It's kinda like being
in a samurai film.

191
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,780
-Just as the rumors
said, it really

192
00:09:25,813 --> 00:09:28,380
does look like a
genuine haunted house.

193
00:09:28,413 --> 00:09:29,546
-Yes.

194
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,980
And I'm definitely sensing
traces of yokai aura

195
00:09:32,013 --> 00:09:33,246
all around us.

196
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:37,546
-It's probably just your
imagination. [nervous laughter]

197
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,080
-It seems to me like
she's already figured out

198
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:42,146
this really is a haunted house.

199
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,980
-Well, that makes things easier.

200
00:09:44,013 --> 00:09:46,880
Let's just scare them until
they all run out of here.

201
00:09:46,913 --> 00:09:48,513
-Forget about that, Natto Kozo.

202
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:52,380
It would be against
the master's wishes.

203
00:09:52,413 --> 00:09:53,113
-Up there.

204
00:09:58,246 --> 00:09:59,246
Maybe I imagined it.

205
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,713
-It feels like something's
really going to appear.

206
00:10:14,746 --> 00:10:19,313
--[deep breath] What
a great atmosphere.

207
00:10:19,346 --> 00:10:22,013
This is the perfect place to
hold the Kiyojuji Paranormal

208
00:10:22,046 --> 00:10:24,313
Patrol's first official meeting.

209
00:10:24,346 --> 00:10:25,013
OK.

210
00:10:25,046 --> 00:10:26,213
So let's get started.

211
00:10:26,246 --> 00:10:27,613
Shall we?

212
00:10:27,646 --> 00:10:30,013
First off, I want to announce
the very interesting results

213
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,546
of my yokai research.

214
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,246
-Wait.

215
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,713
You did yokai research?

216
00:10:33,746 --> 00:10:34,813
-Yes.

217
00:10:34,846 --> 00:10:37,080
Yokai are separated
into several categories.

218
00:10:37,113 --> 00:10:39,880
These include yokai taking
on the form of a human being

219
00:10:39,913 --> 00:10:43,246
to supernatural beings such
as demons, tengu, and kappa,

220
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:47,446
and even physical manifestations
of supernatural phenomena.

221
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,113
-I've made some
tea for all of you.

222
00:10:51,146 --> 00:10:52,880
Please have some while it's hot.

223
00:10:58,746 --> 00:11:00,180
Here you go.

224
00:11:00,213 --> 00:11:02,146
And one for you.

225
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,046
-That's OK.

226
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,813
I'll handle the rest.

227
00:11:04,846 --> 00:11:06,413
-Make yourselves at home.

228
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,546
-Oh wow, Nura.

229
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:14,713
How come you never told me you
had such a hot older sister?

230
00:11:14,746 --> 00:11:16,080
-You have a sister?

231
00:11:16,113 --> 00:11:17,346
-Uh.

232
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,780
No, she's just someone who
helps around the house.

233
00:11:19,813 --> 00:11:21,113
That's all.

234
00:11:21,146 --> 00:11:22,046
-What?

235
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,446
You have maids working here?

236
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,046
Are you rich or something?

237
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,780
-No.

238
00:11:25,813 --> 00:11:27,646
No, not really.

239
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,846
-You know what?

240
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,746
There's something very
strange about this house.

241
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,046
-Oh come on.

242
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,380
Don't be saying stuff like that.

243
00:11:34,413 --> 00:11:35,213
-Sorry.

244
00:11:35,246 --> 00:11:36,480
I need to go to the bathroom.

245
00:11:41,013 --> 00:11:42,180
[knock]

246
00:11:42,213 --> 00:11:42,746
-Yes.

247
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,446
-Hey, Kejoro.

248
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,013
NARRATOR: Master,
what's the matter?

249
00:11:47,046 --> 00:11:49,313
-What the hell were you
thinking back there?

250
00:11:49,346 --> 00:11:51,313
I told you not to show
yourself to my friends

251
00:11:51,346 --> 00:11:52,546
while they were here tonight.

252
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,180
And then, you went
and did it any way.

253
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,346
-Oh, I'm very sorry, master.

254
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,813
The kitchen wasn't notified.

255
00:11:57,846 --> 00:12:00,046
And I thought your guests
would like some tea.

256
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,413
RIKUO: Well, anyway,
don't come out any more.

257
00:12:02,446 --> 00:12:03,913
I'm begging you.

258
00:12:03,946 --> 00:12:05,580
[door sliding shut]

259
00:12:05,613 --> 00:12:07,446
[sighing]

260
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,138
-Dammit.

261
00:12:16,113 --> 00:12:19,880
-Sorry to keep you-- huh?

262
00:12:19,913 --> 00:12:22,246
-Yura, where are we going?

263
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,680
-Is it all right for
us to be walking around

264
00:12:24,713 --> 00:12:26,546
without Nura's permission?

265
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,380
-Oh no.

266
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,780
They're nosing around the house.

267
00:12:28,813 --> 00:12:30,646
-This could be bad.

268
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:34,446
-We all better hide
before they find us.

269
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,146
-This sure is getting hectic.

270
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,246
-We have no choice.

271
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,580
We're doing this for the master.

272
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:43,980
-Hey, everyone.

273
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,246
So this is where you were.

274
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:51,513
-I sense a great amount
of yokai aura here.

275
00:12:51,546 --> 00:12:53,080
No mistake about it.

276
00:12:53,113 --> 00:12:54,880
I feel the presence of a yokai.

277
00:12:54,913 --> 00:12:56,446
RIKUO (VOICEOVER):
How could she tell?

278
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,346
Who is this girl?

279
00:13:11,903 --> 00:13:14,270
-Man, your house is
really big, Nura.

280
00:13:14,303 --> 00:13:15,103
-Yeah.

281
00:13:15,137 --> 00:13:16,437
It's not as big as mine though.

282
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:19,370
-I'd get lost if I
were here by myself.

283
00:13:19,403 --> 00:13:22,537
-Uh, say, why don't we all
head back to the parlor

284
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:23,603
and have our tea?

285
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:24,803
-No.

286
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:26,070
I want to look around
your house a little more

287
00:13:26,103 --> 00:13:27,370
if you don't mind.

288
00:13:27,403 --> 00:13:28,303
[groan]

289
00:13:31,137 --> 00:13:32,970
-This is the bath, isn't it?

290
00:13:33,003 --> 00:13:34,637
RIKUO (VOICEOVER):
I'm a little worried.

291
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,837
I hope no one's in there.

292
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:37,637
-Excuse me.

293
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:44,137
There's nothing in here.

294
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:45,903
-Thank goodness.

295
00:13:45,937 --> 00:13:48,770
Well, of course, there
aren't yokai in here.

296
00:13:48,803 --> 00:13:50,103
Shall we go?

297
00:14:07,803 --> 00:14:08,837
-Is that a natto?

298
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:11,970
-Natto Kozo to be exact.

299
00:14:12,003 --> 00:14:13,070
-All right.

300
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:14,270
We're going to check
out every single nook

301
00:14:14,303 --> 00:14:15,870
and cranny of this house.

302
00:14:15,903 --> 00:14:16,370
-Huh?

303
00:14:16,403 --> 00:14:18,737
No, don't.

304
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:21,970
-[growling]

305
00:14:22,003 --> 00:14:24,470
I can't believe the third
heir of the Nura clan

306
00:14:24,503 --> 00:14:26,637
is hanging around with humans.

307
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:27,837
How pathetic!

308
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,570
RIKUO (VOICEOVER): I can
guess what he's thinking.

309
00:14:35,337 --> 00:14:38,570
-Hey, are you still
going to look around?

310
00:14:38,603 --> 00:14:39,803
-Wait.

311
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:42,370
I'm sensing something
suspicious from this room.

312
00:14:42,403 --> 00:14:43,837
-Huh?

313
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:45,937
KIYOTSUGU: Wow.

314
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:48,870
What a magnificent
Buddha statue.

315
00:14:48,903 --> 00:14:50,337
-Oh wow.

316
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:52,003
-This is world class.

317
00:14:52,037 --> 00:14:54,603
-You really are filthy
rich, aren't you?

318
00:14:54,637 --> 00:14:55,170
-No.

319
00:14:55,203 --> 00:14:56,070
Really, I'm not.

320
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:56,937
Hey, guys.

321
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:58,970
Wait a minute.

322
00:14:59,003 --> 00:15:00,803
-This Buddha statue.

323
00:15:00,837 --> 00:15:01,370
-What about it?

324
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:18,970
Please don't let
her find you guys.

325
00:15:19,003 --> 00:15:20,403
-That's very odd.

326
00:15:20,437 --> 00:15:22,303
I definitely sense
some yokai aura.

327
00:15:32,137 --> 00:15:33,203
-Listen.

328
00:15:33,237 --> 00:15:34,570
My grandpa told me that
under no circumstances

329
00:15:34,603 --> 00:15:37,137
should anyone ever
touch this statue.

330
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,837
-Your grandfather?

331
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,270
-Hello, Rikuo.

332
00:15:40,303 --> 00:15:42,037
Are these your friends?

333
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:42,670
-Yes.

334
00:15:42,703 --> 00:15:43,737
Nice to meet you.

335
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:45,037
RIKUO (VOICEOVER):
The Supreme Commander

336
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,703
of the yokai has arrived.

337
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,537
-Want some candy?

338
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,003
-Oh, thank you.

339
00:15:50,037 --> 00:15:50,970
-I'll have some.

340
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:58,003
-Well, hello there.

341
00:15:58,037 --> 00:16:01,703
It looks like my grandson
has made some good friends.

342
00:16:01,737 --> 00:16:02,503
KIYOTSUGU: Yes.

343
00:16:02,537 --> 00:16:04,403
We are the best of friends.

344
00:16:04,437 --> 00:16:08,070
By the way, this
candy tastes terrible.

345
00:16:08,103 --> 00:16:09,803
RIKUO (VOICEOVER):
They didn't notice.

346
00:16:09,837 --> 00:16:11,870
NURARIHYON: Why don't you
make yourselves at home?

347
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:17,837
-Oh wow.

348
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,270
I can't believe how
much Nura's grandfather

349
00:16:19,303 --> 00:16:21,270
looks like a real yokai.

350
00:16:21,303 --> 00:16:22,470
-Oh, come on now.

351
00:16:22,503 --> 00:16:23,337
He's not.

352
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:25,503
He's human like us.

353
00:16:25,537 --> 00:16:27,103
YURA: How suspicious.

354
00:16:27,137 --> 00:16:29,270
ZEEN is said that
high ranking yokai

355
00:16:29,303 --> 00:16:33,237
are very good at hiding their
yokai aura from detection.

356
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,403
-Hey, come on.

357
00:16:34,437 --> 00:16:35,903
Why don't we stop
looking for yokai

358
00:16:35,937 --> 00:16:37,903
and head back to the room?

359
00:16:37,937 --> 00:16:39,570
-Hm.

360
00:16:39,603 --> 00:16:41,137
RIKUO: Is there something else?

361
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:45,837
YURA: I feel like
we're being watched.

362
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:48,537
[hissing]

363
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:50,470
[screaming]

364
00:16:53,837 --> 00:16:54,770
-Hold it.

365
00:16:54,803 --> 00:16:55,737
-Kana!

366
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:58,137
-I hate rats.

367
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:00,037
-Ienaga, would you
mind getting off me?

368
00:17:04,537 --> 00:17:05,903
-Wait up, Miss Keikain.

369
00:17:05,937 --> 00:17:06,403
Come back.

370
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:16,070
-Hold it.

371
00:17:16,103 --> 00:17:17,870
You're a yokai, aren't you?

372
00:17:29,303 --> 00:17:29,770
-Master.

373
00:17:37,737 --> 00:17:41,737
-In the name of the
Keikain clan onmyogi,

374
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:46,037
I shall wipe out all ayakashi
from the face of the Earth.

375
00:17:52,837 --> 00:17:53,303
Destroy!

376
00:17:58,203 --> 00:17:59,237
-Wait!

377
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:01,603
You mean you're an
onmyogi, the ones that

378
00:18:01,637 --> 00:18:05,770
exterminate yokai for a living?

379
00:18:05,803 --> 00:18:07,537
KIYOTSUGU: An onmyogi?

380
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:10,437
Hey, Yura, is that what
you just said you are?

381
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,037
-Yes.

382
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:11,837
-Then it's true.

383
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:12,770
I knew it all along.

384
00:18:12,803 --> 00:18:16,503
Onmyogi and yokai
really do exist.

385
00:18:16,537 --> 00:18:18,537
-Amazing!

386
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:21,837
-Yes, I am a direct descendant
of the respected Keikain clan

387
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:25,270
onmyogi who hunt
for yokai in Kyoto.

388
00:18:25,303 --> 00:18:26,703
-You know, now that
you mention it.

389
00:18:26,737 --> 00:18:30,137
I think I've heard the
name Keikain on TV before.

390
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:33,470
YURA: That was probably my
grandfather, Hidemoto Keikain.

391
00:18:33,503 --> 00:18:34,870
-I don't get it.

392
00:18:34,903 --> 00:18:37,837
Why would someone famous like
you suddenly move to this town?

393
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:40,470
-I came here,
because Ukiyoe Town

394
00:18:40,503 --> 00:18:43,437
is famous for its frequent
supernatural occurrences.

395
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:45,937
According to rumors,
the Lord of all yokai

396
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:48,770
lives right here in this town.

397
00:18:48,803 --> 00:18:52,503
I was sent here by my clan as a
test of my skills and training

398
00:18:52,537 --> 00:18:56,070
to seal as many yokai
as I can, and then, I

399
00:18:56,103 --> 00:18:58,003
can become the head
of the Keikain clan

400
00:18:58,037 --> 00:19:00,603
as the top onmyogi in the land.

401
00:19:00,637 --> 00:19:02,437
-No way.

402
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,437
That's amazing.

403
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:05,137
A real onmyogi has
come to our town.

404
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:06,837
RIKUO (VOICEOVER): I
don't really get it.

405
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:08,770
But I think things
just got really bad.

406
00:19:08,803 --> 00:19:10,303
KIYOTSUGU: As of
this moment, you're

407
00:19:10,337 --> 00:19:14,703
an official member of the
Kiyojuji Paranormal Patrol.

408
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:16,937
-Sorry for the trouble
I caused today.

409
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:17,937
-Why?

410
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:21,537
Today has been quite
a successful day.

411
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:22,870
-Come and visit us again soon.

412
00:19:22,903 --> 00:19:23,570
OK.

413
00:19:23,603 --> 00:19:24,770
-Bye.

414
00:19:24,803 --> 00:19:25,837
-Yes.

415
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:28,603
I'm positive that
we'll all come again.

416
00:19:28,637 --> 00:19:30,670
-Rikuo, hurry on in, all right.

417
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:36,970
-Master, I missed that
suspicious looking rat.

418
00:19:37,003 --> 00:19:38,337
I'm very sorry.

419
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:39,637
-It's OK.

420
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:42,370
-But I'm certain it
wasn't from here.

421
00:19:42,403 --> 00:19:43,303
-I thought so.

422
00:19:43,337 --> 00:19:44,837
-Who was that rat?

423
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:45,737
-I don't know.

424
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:48,503
I've never seen him before.

425
00:19:48,537 --> 00:19:49,103
Wait a minute.

426
00:19:57,137 --> 00:19:59,937
-That rat sure was
scary, wasn't it?

427
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:02,170
-I'm so sorry for scaring you.

428
00:20:02,203 --> 00:20:02,703
-What?

429
00:20:02,737 --> 00:20:03,370
Not at all.

430
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:04,603
It's all right.

431
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:05,137
-Excuse me.

432
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:11,070
-Let's go.

433
00:20:14,137 --> 00:20:17,537
So you're living by yourself?

434
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:18,770
That sounds cool.

435
00:20:18,803 --> 00:20:20,470
I'd love to have my own place.

436
00:20:20,503 --> 00:20:21,503
-Yeah.

437
00:20:21,537 --> 00:20:22,803
Well, it's really
not all that great.

438
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,403
-Looks like I found
us some cuties.

439
00:20:33,003 --> 00:20:35,970
-You smell bad.

440
00:20:36,003 --> 00:20:39,037
-What did you say?

441
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,770
-Yura, who are these guys?

442
00:20:40,803 --> 00:20:43,937
-They're the types I
talked about earlier today.

443
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:46,237
The ones with plenty
of intelligence,

444
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,970
but no rationality.

445
00:20:48,003 --> 00:20:49,470
-They're yokai?

446
00:20:49,503 --> 00:20:52,637
-Ah, now don't be so
unfriendly, my kittens.

447
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:55,737
You're friends with the
third heir, aren't you?

448
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:57,770
The night is long.

449
00:20:57,803 --> 00:21:01,003
Let's gnaw on you until
you're nothing but bones.

-Don't get fresh with me.

454
00:21:13,603 --> 00:21:17,237
I'm not a big fan of rodents.

455
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,003
-Get them.

456
00:21:21,203 --> 00:21:22,103

Tanro.

464
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,637
-So, you use shikigami?

465
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:50,070
You're an onmyogi.

NARRATOR: The girl reveals her
true identity as an onmyogi.

467
00:21:53,703 --> 00:21:56,137
Will she be able
to defeat her enemy

468
00:21:56,170 --> 00:22:00,703
with her skillful movements
and intense flames?

469

to devour all the rats.

Kozo, how old are you?

NATTO KOZO: Who knows?

473
00:23:42,445 --> 00:23:44,011
I'm not sure myself anymore.

00:23:44,045 --> 00:23:45,811
RIKUO: But doesn't
"kozo" mean kid?

475
00:23:45,845 --> 00:23:48,545
NATTO KOZO: Well, I guess
that means I'm forever young.
