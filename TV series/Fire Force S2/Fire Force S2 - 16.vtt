That one is so much bigger!

00:00:28.236 --> 00:00:30.447 position:50% align:center
[MAKI] If the White-Clad
decided to show up here,

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:31.614 position:50% align:center
you can guarantee they're trying

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:33.908 position:50% align:center
to get their hands
on the Adolla Burst.

00:00:33.992 --> 00:00:37.120 position:50% align:center
So is the best course of action
to team up with Haijima

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:41.416 position:50% align:center
and change the dynamic from
this three-way battle situation?

[DOMINIONS LADY] In the name
of the Great God Sol,

00:00:43.418 --> 00:00:45.462 position:50% align:center
I'll punish you!

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:08.568 position:50% align:center
What the--? Didn't work?

00:01:08.651 --> 00:01:11.029 position:50% align:center
Must be some kind of insulation.

[ARROW]
Haumea, please get back.

00:01:15.492 --> 00:01:18.578 position:50% align:center
Tch. This is none
of your beeswax!

00:01:27.629 --> 00:01:29.923 position:50% align:center
[ARROW]
This one. She's relentless.

00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:33.551 position:50% align:center
I need to get some
distance between us.

00:01:33.635 --> 00:01:35.929 position:50% align:center
But I can't seem to
pull away from her.

00:01:36.012 --> 00:01:39.557 position:50% align:center
She's got the upper hand.
Is she going to--?

00:01:41.393 --> 00:01:42.769 position:50% align:center
What's the the matter
with you, Arrow?

00:01:42.852 --> 00:01:45.939 position:50% align:center
You can't seriously be
this freakin' pathetic?

00:01:49.025 --> 00:01:49.984 position:50% align:center
[ARROW]
Forgive me.

00:01:50.068 --> 00:01:51.861 position:50% align:center
And you call yourself
a protector?

00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:53.822 position:50% align:center
[ARROW] According to the buddy
system we'd established

00:01:53.905 --> 00:01:55.365 position:50% align:center
with Pillars and
their protectors,

00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:58.618 position:50% align:center
I should be with Commander Sho,
and you with Charon.

00:01:58.702 --> 00:02:00.245 position:50% align:center
These pairings were
based on the idea

00:02:00.328 --> 00:02:02.455 position:50% align:center
that those were the most
complementary matches.

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:03.540 position:50% align:center
And now that we're
ignoring them,

00:02:03.623 --> 00:02:05.834 position:50% align:center
we find ourselves out of sync.

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.423 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't you rather
be paired with a buddy

00:02:11.506 --> 00:02:14.092 position:50% align:center
that'll give you a full-body
vibrating massage?

00:02:14.175 --> 00:02:16.386 position:50% align:center
Because you know
I got you, girl.

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:18.346 position:50% align:center
I can see sparks
coming off that lady,

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.473 position:50% align:center
so is she trying to
electrocute her?

00:02:20.557 --> 00:02:24.019 position:50% align:center
Looks like it. So stay back.

00:02:24.102 --> 00:02:28.440 position:50% align:center
[HAUMEA] I don't wanna hear any
of your lame excuses, Arrow.

00:02:28.523 --> 00:02:32.318 position:50% align:center
So you'd better protect me,
or you're dead meat.

00:02:32.402 --> 00:02:33.611 position:50% align:center
Wonderful!

00:02:33.695 --> 00:02:35.530 position:50% align:center
My generator is
getting warmed up.

00:02:35.613 --> 00:02:38.825 position:50% align:center
Punishing you is
gonna be so fun!

00:02:38.908 --> 00:02:41.619 position:50% align:center
[HAUMEA] Charon will be taking
the Sixth Pillar any minute now.

00:02:41.703 --> 00:02:44.998 position:50% align:center
So stop with all the moping
around, you hear me?

00:02:45.081 --> 00:02:46.082 position:50% align:center

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:48.752 position:50% align:center
Let's go ham on these losers!

If that White-Clad chick uses
her toxic EM waves, we're toast!

The plasma density's risin'
over this whole area.

I've gotta hurry up!

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:00.138 position:50% align:center

00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:01.723 position:50% align:center
Walk!

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:05.560 position:50% align:center
Snap!

00:03:08.271 --> 00:03:10.774 position:50% align:center
Where's Nataku?

Let me go!

Yeah, the kid's right
over here, see?

Out of my way.

I need to get to those
feeble little ones first.

Oh, yeah? What about Nataku?

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:32.003 position:50% align:center

to fight the weak?

What do we do?

00:03:55.485 --> 00:03:57.070 position:50% align:center

Hold your horses, Ritsu.

some raw materials.

power, Miss Inca,

Oh, man!

I have to admit, you're a real
pain in the ass to fight.

There has to be someone here
who's more to my liking.

[RITSU] Hmm... This raw material
will definitely work.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:42.337 position:50% align:center
Now all I need is an Infernal
to supply the base.

here will be perfect.

the heebie-jeebies.

00:11:33.276 --> 00:11:38.865 position:50% align:center
[NATAKU] My hopes are up,
but my feelings are down.

00:11:38.948 --> 00:11:43.745 position:50% align:center
He keeps on building the fire,
and it's pushing me up and up.

00:11:43.828 --> 00:11:48.375 position:50% align:center
Forcing me closer to that
thick smoke above.

00:11:48.458 --> 00:11:52.379 position:50% align:center
But that's where my hopes are.

00:11:52.462 --> 00:11:55.131 position:50% align:center
My hopes are up there.

00:11:55.215 --> 00:11:57.509 position:50% align:center
Is that really true, though?

00:11:57.592 --> 00:12:02.180 position:50% align:center
I'm going up into the smoke,
but it's so hard to breathe.

00:12:02.263 --> 00:12:06.226 position:50% align:center
My hopes are up.
My feelings are down.

00:12:06.309 --> 00:12:11.690 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna suffocate.
I can't catch my breath.

00:12:11.773 --> 00:12:16.486 position:50% align:center
This is it. I'm really
gonna suffocate.

00:12:18.154 --> 00:12:23.368 position:50% align:center
[NATAKU] I'm suffocating...
on my infected imagination.

00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:35.255 position:50% align:center
My hopes are suffocating!

00:12:35.338 --> 00:12:38.383 position:50% align:center
And I want you all to
suffocate with them!

00:12:38.466 --> 00:12:39.801 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:12:41.428 --> 00:12:46.808 position:50% align:center
What's happening to him?
It's like he's out of his mind.

00:12:46.891 --> 00:12:50.687 position:50% align:center
Haumea. She must've
done something.

00:12:52.814 --> 00:12:53.982 position:50% align:center
[HAUMEA]
Motor Head.

00:12:54.065 --> 00:12:56.151 position:50% align:center
Sometimes you've gotta
goose the dopamine

00:12:56.234 --> 00:12:58.528 position:50% align:center
and beta-endorphins
in someone's brain.

00:12:58.611 --> 00:13:01.698 position:50% align:center
Turn up the pressure and
make things exciting!

00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:03.533 position:50% align:center
The kid's pretty prone
to this stuff anyway

00:13:03.616 --> 00:13:05.952 position:50% align:center
so it's not gonna
break the bank.

00:13:06.036 --> 00:13:08.955 position:50% align:center
His "infected imagination"
is kinda like a manifestation

00:13:09.039 --> 00:13:11.833 position:50% align:center
of the pressure he's
always felt inside of him.

00:13:11.916 --> 00:13:15.503 position:50% align:center
I want everyone to suffocate!

00:13:34.981 --> 00:13:37.275 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN] Holy crap,
you gotta be kiddin' me!

00:13:37.359 --> 00:13:39.110 position:50% align:center
Things are rampin' up, Captain!

00:13:39.194 --> 00:13:41.154 position:50% align:center
You need to get away
from there, right now!

00:13:41.237 --> 00:13:44.032 position:50% align:center
[OBI] What are you saying,
Vulcan? What's going on?

00:13:44.115 --> 00:13:46.368 position:50% align:center
Radiation readings are
startin' to climb.

00:13:46.451 --> 00:13:48.745 position:50% align:center
Anyone unpowered has to go!

00:13:48.828 --> 00:13:50.872 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Sister, Licht, stay with me!

00:13:50.955 --> 00:13:53.708 position:50% align:center
I know that crazy White-
Clad chick's behind this.

00:13:53.792 --> 00:13:55.835 position:50% align:center
Gonna need Arthur
to counter her.

00:13:55.919 --> 00:13:58.797 position:50% align:center
I'll go pick him up and
head over your way!

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:02.759 position:50% align:center
Arthur! Where are you,
Arthur? Hey!

00:14:02.842 --> 00:14:04.844 position:50% align:center
High-ho, Silver!

00:14:04.928 --> 00:14:08.682 position:50% align:center
Fine, I'll be your "Silver."
You just gotta help me out, man!

00:14:08.765 --> 00:14:10.642 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
Heh.

00:14:10.725 --> 00:14:13.186 position:50% align:center
[OBI] How far do we need
to be from the radiation?

00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:15.313 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] We unpowered folks
will probably be fine

00:14:15.397 --> 00:14:18.191 position:50% align:center
if we stay about 200
meters or so from it.

00:14:18.274 --> 00:14:20.443 position:50% align:center
But the pyrokinetics battling
that big ol' thing

00:14:20.527 --> 00:14:22.946 position:50% align:center
are in a pretty dicey situation.

00:14:28.952 --> 00:14:31.996 position:50% align:center
The radiation's coming from
a third-generation's ability,

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.665 position:50% align:center
so those of us who
are pyrokinetics

00:14:33.748 --> 00:14:35.834 position:50% align:center
shouldn't be hurt by it.

00:14:35.917 --> 00:14:38.420 position:50% align:center
But even still, if it
keeps on getting stronger,

00:14:38.503 --> 00:14:40.839 position:50% align:center
we're all gonna be
in big trouble.

00:14:40.922 --> 00:14:43.258 position:50% align:center
Hey, the heck's goin'
on with your giant?

00:14:43.341 --> 00:14:45.093 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, Miss Inca,

00:14:45.176 --> 00:14:47.512 position:50% align:center
but it's too dangerous for you
to be down here with us.

00:14:47.595 --> 00:14:50.098 position:50% align:center
Oh, come on, that
thing won't attack me.

00:14:50.181 --> 00:14:53.601 position:50% align:center
[RITSU] Well, Haumea messed
with the Sixth Pillar's brain.

00:14:53.685 --> 00:14:56.146 position:50% align:center
Plus, those heat rays
appear to be radioactive.

00:14:56.229 --> 00:14:58.982 position:50% align:center
Oh, really? That is dangerous.

00:14:59.065 --> 00:15:00.900 position:50% align:center
So I believe it would be
for the best if you--

00:15:00.984 --> 00:15:02.610 position:50% align:center
Uh, you're gonna die
if you stay there.

00:15:02.694 --> 00:15:04.654 position:50% align:center
What? Really?

00:15:08.033 --> 00:15:09.409 position:50% align:center
This is such a pain.

00:15:09.492 --> 00:15:10.785 position:50% align:center
How are we supposed to
get the Sixth Pillar?

00:15:10.869 --> 00:15:14.372 position:50% align:center
Awesome! Haumea is so much
more fun than I thought!

00:15:14.456 --> 00:15:18.335 position:50% align:center
Not surprising. Haumea had
to make things complicated.

00:15:18.418 --> 00:15:23.465 position:50% align:center
The giant Infernal's gone crazy.
It's just destroying everything.

00:15:23.548 --> 00:15:26.217 position:50% align:center
All right! We're
stopping Nataku.

00:15:26.301 --> 00:15:29.387 position:50% align:center
The only way... is kill him.

00:15:29.471 --> 00:15:32.015 position:50% align:center
I thought he was, like,
super important to Haijima!

00:15:32.098 --> 00:15:33.600 position:50% align:center
You really gonna go against
the company like that?

00:15:33.683 --> 00:15:34.809 position:50% align:center
You my boss?

00:15:34.893 --> 00:15:36.102 position:50% align:center
Can you stop thinking
about hurting people

00:15:36.186 --> 00:15:38.271 position:50% align:center
for just one second
and focus on your job?

00:15:38.355 --> 00:15:39.856 position:50% align:center
You my boss?

00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:42.734 position:50% align:center
We're gonna have to take down
the giant and get Nataku out.

00:15:42.817 --> 00:15:44.110 position:50% align:center
Let's go!

00:15:48.281 --> 00:15:50.033 position:50% align:center
Rock hard!

00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:58.792 position:50% align:center
Kurono!

00:15:58.875 --> 00:16:01.002 position:50% align:center
I'll draw the laser's fire
and give you an opening!

00:16:01.086 --> 00:16:02.504 position:50% align:center
You go and--

00:16:10.011 --> 00:16:11.721 position:50% align:center
Too strong.

00:16:14.265 --> 00:16:17.811 position:50% align:center
Way too strong. No good.

00:16:20.647 --> 00:16:22.941 position:50% align:center
Need to get a new job.

00:16:23.024 --> 00:16:25.151 position:50% align:center
Like, come on, are you serious?

00:16:25.235 --> 00:16:26.736 position:50% align:center
What is your deal, man?!

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:29.114 position:50% align:center
You're supposed to
be helping me out!

00:16:29.197 --> 00:16:30.323 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA yells]

00:16:31.574 --> 00:16:32.909 position:50% align:center
Uh-oh!

00:16:44.212 --> 00:16:45.380 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Wow, thanks!

00:16:45.463 --> 00:16:48.133 position:50% align:center
[CHARON] It's my duty
to protect the Pillars.

00:16:49.175 --> 00:16:51.511 position:50% align:center
That means you.

00:16:51.594 --> 00:16:52.762 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:52.846 --> 00:16:57.767 position:50% align:center
[GREAT FLAMING ONE groaning]

00:16:57.851 --> 00:17:00.937 position:50% align:center
So while I cover,
you can use your speed.

00:17:01.021 --> 00:17:02.355 position:50% align:center
Get up close and pull him out.

00:17:02.439 --> 00:17:05.150 position:50% align:center
I don't really need
your protection for that.

00:17:05.233 --> 00:17:06.693 position:50% align:center
I just don't get it.

00:17:06.776 --> 00:17:09.154 position:50% align:center
Most men are like
little boys at heart,

00:17:09.237 --> 00:17:13.158 position:50% align:center
so why do they waste their
energy on getting stronger?

00:17:13.241 --> 00:17:17.162 position:50% align:center
Amazing! You're a superstar,
Taku! And so strong.

00:17:17.245 --> 00:17:20.749 position:50% align:center
Let 'em have it!
Just give it a try!

00:17:23.084 --> 00:17:25.587 position:50% align:center
All of us are still
hanging in there,

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:27.964 position:50% align:center
but if this radiation
doesn't start falling soon,

00:17:28.048 --> 00:17:30.258 position:50% align:center
we're gonna be in
a world of hurt.

00:17:30.342 --> 00:17:33.053 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN] Aw, man, we are
runnin' out of time fast!

00:17:33.136 --> 00:17:35.805 position:50% align:center
I gotta get Arthur
over there, ASAP!

00:17:35.889 --> 00:17:37.724 position:50% align:center
So what do you need
me to do and where?

00:17:37.807 --> 00:17:40.602 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN] I need to you be
the legendary knight you are!

00:17:40.685 --> 00:17:42.270 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:17:42.354 --> 00:17:47.025 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah? A knight?
A legendary one? For real?

00:17:47.108 --> 00:17:51.446 position:50% align:center
Where? Where?! Come on! Take me!

00:17:51.529 --> 00:17:52.655 position:50% align:center
Where are we going, Vulcan?

00:17:52.739 --> 00:17:54.407 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
Will you stop that?

00:17:54.491 --> 00:17:57.118 position:50% align:center
We're goin' to a place where
you can be a legendary knight!

00:17:57.202 --> 00:17:58.119 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
What are you waiting for?

00:17:58.203 --> 00:18:00.330 position:50% align:center
We gotta get there right now!

00:18:04.209 --> 00:18:06.586 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
Yup! Very knightly!

00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:09.297 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
I'm just on top of the Matchbox.

00:18:09.381 --> 00:18:10.965 position:50% align:center
Hold on...

00:18:11.049 --> 00:18:13.176 position:50% align:center
You're not just tryin' to
trick me again, are you?

00:18:13.259 --> 00:18:16.179 position:50% align:center
Is this like that time
with Sil-burro, or what?

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:20.225 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
No, it's nothin' scandalous.

00:18:20.308 --> 00:18:22.977 position:50% align:center
Just trust me, okay?

00:18:23.061 --> 00:18:26.439 position:50% align:center
Now, can you see the little slot
in the middle of the hatch?

00:18:26.523 --> 00:18:28.233 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
Yeah, 'course I see it.

00:18:28.316 --> 00:18:30.235 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN] I want you
to take your Excalibur

00:18:30.318 --> 00:18:32.070 position:50% align:center
and stick it right in there.

00:18:32.153 --> 00:18:34.239 position:50% align:center
Everyone's heard the tale
about the legendary knight

00:18:34.322 --> 00:18:38.368 position:50% align:center
that thrusts his legendary blade
into somethin', haven't they?

00:18:38.451 --> 00:18:40.995 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:46.001 --> 00:18:47.085 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
You mean the tale

00:18:47.168 --> 00:18:49.629 position:50% align:center
of the sword-thrusting
legendary knight?

00:18:49.713 --> 00:18:51.715 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN] Underneath
that slot is a machine.

00:18:51.798 --> 00:18:54.259 position:50% align:center
It'll take the plasma generated
by Arthur's Excalibur

00:18:54.342 --> 00:18:55.719 position:50% align:center
and amplify it.

00:18:55.802 --> 00:18:57.679 position:50% align:center
The plan is for the
amplified plasma

00:18:57.762 --> 00:18:59.472 position:50% align:center
to disrupt the zap happy chick.

00:18:59.556 --> 00:19:01.141 position:50% align:center
It'll create a kind
of pseudo EMP attack

00:19:01.224 --> 00:19:04.019 position:50% align:center
that's gonna shut out
her waves completely.

00:19:05.979 --> 00:19:07.522 position:50% align:center
Hang on, it's backwards!

00:19:07.605 --> 00:19:10.233 position:50% align:center
The legendary knight pulls
his blade outta something.

00:19:10.316 --> 00:19:11.609 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
Tch.

00:19:11.693 --> 00:19:13.903 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN] Damn it, the one
thing he actually knows.

00:19:13.987 --> 00:19:15.822 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN] So all you
gotta do is stick it in,

00:19:15.905 --> 00:19:17.115 position:50% align:center
and then you can pull it out!

00:19:17.198 --> 00:19:20.660 position:50% align:center
Say what? You're not
making any sense, Vulcan.

00:19:20.744 --> 00:19:21.494 position:50% align:center
It's dumb.

00:19:21.578 --> 00:19:22.787 position:50% align:center
How do you not understand?!

00:19:22.871 --> 00:19:25.540 position:50% align:center
Look, you've got a legendary
sword, don't you?

00:19:25.623 --> 00:19:28.293 position:50% align:center
But you never had to pull it
outta anything like this.

00:19:28.376 --> 00:19:29.502 position:50% align:center
So if you put it in there,

00:19:29.586 --> 00:19:31.129 position:50% align:center
this will give you a
chance to pull it out

00:19:31.212 --> 00:19:35.508 position:50% align:center
and fulfill your destiny as
a legendary knight, ya know?

00:19:35.592 --> 00:19:41.431 position:50% align:center
Yeah. So, like, what
you're telling me is...

00:19:41.514 --> 00:19:44.184 position:50% align:center
...this little trinket
I carry has actually been

00:19:44.267 --> 00:19:46.561 position:50% align:center
a legendary weapon
this entire time?

00:19:46.644 --> 00:19:48.813 position:50% align:center
That's exactly what I'm sayin'!

00:19:48.897 --> 00:19:50.398 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
A "little trinket"?

00:19:50.482 --> 00:19:53.360 position:50% align:center
I mean, I thought Excalibur was,
like, insanely important to him.

00:19:53.443 --> 00:19:55.695 position:50% align:center
Tch. His mind is a
total mystery to me.

00:19:55.779 --> 00:19:58.198 position:50% align:center
The hell is goin' on in there?

00:19:58.281 --> 00:20:01.242 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
Mh-hm.

00:20:01.326 --> 00:20:02.869 position:50% align:center
Then I'll be a
legendary knight?

00:20:02.952 --> 00:20:03.703 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
Yes!

00:20:03.787 --> 00:20:05.955 position:50% align:center
I get it! Mission accepted!

00:20:06.039 --> 00:20:08.249 position:50% align:center
Then do it, you big dummy!

00:20:12.295 --> 00:20:14.881 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
Electromagnetic Pulse!

00:20:17.217 --> 00:20:19.427 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
Amplification!

00:20:22.722 --> 00:20:23.973 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:20:27.394 --> 00:20:31.606 position:50% align:center
Oh, son of a-- Bet it's that
stupid plasma boy's doing.

00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:33.650 position:50% align:center
Guess Vulcan and
Arthur pulled it off!

00:20:33.733 --> 00:20:36.569 position:50% align:center
So that was the interference
wave thingy, huh?

00:20:36.653 --> 00:20:38.697 position:50% align:center
[HAUMEA]
Arrow!

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:41.074 position:50% align:center
Those jerks blocked my EM waves,

00:20:41.157 --> 00:20:42.992 position:50% align:center
so we gotta clobber that jammer

00:20:43.076 --> 00:20:45.537 position:50% align:center
and make the little
rugrat freak out again.

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:46.705 position:50% align:center
[ARROW]
If you ask me,

00:20:46.788 --> 00:20:49.374 position:50% align:center
it would be better
if she stayed blocked.

00:20:52.377 --> 00:20:54.504 position:50% align:center
No way!

00:20:54.587 --> 00:20:58.341 position:50% align:center
But that EMP means I can't
send the Tekkyo after her.

00:21:00.719 --> 00:21:02.220 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIONS LADY]
I see what's going on here.

00:21:02.303 --> 00:21:04.764 position:50% align:center
We need to stop that naughty
girl from running away.

00:21:04.848 --> 00:21:06.933 position:50% align:center
Wait, your puppet
can still move?

00:21:07.017 --> 00:21:09.644 position:50% align:center
My darling little Dominions
are flame powered,

00:21:09.728 --> 00:21:12.397 position:50% align:center
so no electricity needed.

00:21:14.691 --> 00:21:16.359 position:50% align:center
[HAUMEA]
There he is!

00:21:20.155 --> 00:21:21.990 position:50% align:center
No fair!

00:21:22.073 --> 00:21:23.533 position:50% align:center
[gasps] We just got made!

00:21:23.616 --> 00:21:25.201 position:50% align:center
So, uh, can I pull this out yet?

00:21:25.285 --> 00:21:26.411 position:50% align:center
Nope!

00:21:26.494 --> 00:21:28.621 position:50% align:center
Since Excalibur's a
legendary sword and all,

00:21:28.705 --> 00:21:30.373 position:50% align:center
it won't come out that easily!

00:21:30.457 --> 00:21:33.209 position:50% align:center
Right. Makes sense.

00:21:33.293 --> 00:21:34.711 position:50% align:center
So I was wondering.

00:21:34.794 --> 00:21:37.047 position:50% align:center
Why does the sacred stone
with the legendary sword in it

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:38.757 position:50% align:center
have a driver's seat?

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:40.842 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:21:40.925 --> 00:21:42.093 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
What's going on?

00:21:42.177 --> 00:21:44.471 position:50% align:center
Why's the stone moving?
This isn't right!

00:21:44.554 --> 00:21:46.639 position:50% align:center
[VOICE]
EMP intensity declining.

00:21:46.723 --> 00:21:47.640 position:50% align:center
Uh-oh!

00:21:47.724 --> 00:21:49.100 position:50% align:center
And Arthur's
role-playing fantasy

00:21:49.184 --> 00:21:51.186 position:50% align:center
is startin' to fade, too!

00:21:54.272 --> 00:21:55.273 position:50% align:center
Listen!

00:21:55.357 --> 00:21:56.900 position:50% align:center
Turns out the sword's
not in a stone,

00:21:56.983 --> 00:21:58.818 position:50% align:center
it's in the back
of a huge snake!

00:21:58.902 --> 00:22:00.528 position:50% align:center
Don't let that thing
shake ya off!

00:22:00.612 --> 00:22:01.821 position:50% align:center
A serpent?

00:22:01.905 --> 00:22:03.531 position:50% align:center
Yeah, yeah, sure!

00:22:05.658 --> 00:22:09.621 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN] Check it out!
Extreme Technique: Sidewinder!

00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:15.251 position:50% align:center
What the--? Think I heard
somethin' whiz by.

00:22:15.335 --> 00:22:16.711 position:50% align:center
[ARROW]
I missed them.

00:22:16.795 --> 00:22:19.923 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
Agh! Curse you, giant serpent!

00:22:20.006 --> 00:22:21.174 position:50% align:center
Vile beast!

00:22:21.257 --> 00:22:23.093 position:50% align:center
You may try to throw off
the Knight King Arthur,

00:22:23.176 --> 00:22:25.637 position:50% align:center
but your struggle
will be in vain!

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:28.640 position:50% align:center
The legendary sacred sword
shall not be moved!

00:22:28.723 --> 00:22:31.267 position:50% align:center
[VOICE] Radioactive
concentration still climbing.

00:22:31.351 --> 00:22:32.936 position:50% align:center
Shinra.

00:22:33.019 --> 00:22:36.648 position:50% align:center
We need you to do something
while we still have time!

00:24:20.877 --> 00:24:23.421 position:50% align:center
[IRIS] Nataku is swallowed
up by the giant Infernal

00:24:23.505 --> 00:24:25.173 position:50% align:center
at a dark place in his mind.

00:24:25.256 --> 00:24:27.509 position:50% align:center
And the radiation keeps
on getting stronger.

00:24:27.592 --> 00:24:29.511 position:50% align:center
This situation is
extremely dangerous!

00:24:29.594 --> 00:24:31.513 position:50% align:center
Please! You have to stop him!

00:24:31.596 --> 00:24:34.182 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
You dumbass!

00:24:34.265 --> 00:24:36.017 position:50% align:center
