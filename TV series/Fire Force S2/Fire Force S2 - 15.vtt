[OBI] Causes of death
are many and varied.

00:00:22.313 --> 00:00:25.734 position:50% align:center
Old age. Illness. Suicide.

00:00:25.817 --> 00:00:27.485 position:50% align:center
But out of that long,
morbid list,

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:31.281 position:50% align:center
there's one end that people
fear above all others.

00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:35.410 position:50% align:center line:10%
[OBI]
Death by fire.

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:44.627 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:46.171 position:50% align:center
We need you in the
special care room, stat!

00:00:46.254 --> 00:00:48.548 position:50% align:center
Something weird's going
on with Nataku!

00:00:52.427 --> 00:00:54.846 position:50% align:center
[NATAKU]
My right arm... It's burning!

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:57.140 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:01:02.187 --> 00:01:03.480 position:50% align:center
Is that...?

00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:07.233 position:50% align:center
I'm on fire.

00:01:07.317 --> 00:01:09.069 position:50% align:center
We have confirmation
of an Adolla Burst

00:01:09.152 --> 00:01:11.363 position:50% align:center
in the special care
room from Nataku.

00:01:11.446 --> 00:01:15.116 position:50% align:center
You don't say? So he's
here after all, huh?

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.828 position:50% align:center
That's classified.
I can't discuss it with you.

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:19.954 position:50% align:center
Hey, Kurono! Stop...

00:01:20.038 --> 00:01:21.581 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Seems as though
the Adolla Burst

00:01:21.664 --> 00:01:24.959 position:50% align:center
has awakened in
the Sixth Pillar.

00:01:25.043 --> 00:01:29.130 position:50% align:center
I wonder if Shinra's burst
triggered it in the little guy.

00:01:32.008 --> 00:01:33.510 position:50% align:center
D'you read me?

00:01:33.593 --> 00:01:36.554 position:50% align:center
Captain Obi, are you there?

00:01:36.638 --> 00:01:39.140 position:50% align:center
There's been a new development.

00:01:41.643 --> 00:01:43.978 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN yells]

00:01:44.062 --> 00:01:45.313 position:50% align:center
What the--?

00:01:45.397 --> 00:01:47.357 position:50% align:center
Shinra and Licht are in trouble!
We gotta hurry up!

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.067 position:50% align:center
If anything happens
to either of them,

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.361 position:50% align:center
Haijima is in for
a world of hurt!

00:01:51.444 --> 00:01:54.114 position:50% align:center
This is war, you dumb bastards!

00:01:56.282 --> 00:01:58.159 position:50% align:center
A Matchbox broke through
the security gate!

00:01:58.243 --> 00:02:00.537 position:50% align:center
Trying to identify
who's inside now!

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.955 position:50% align:center
[LICHT sighs]

00:02:02.038 --> 00:02:04.541 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] All I said was there's
been a new development.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.804 position:50% align:center
[RESEARCHER C]
What's happening in there?

00:03:40.887 --> 00:03:41.596 position:50% align:center
[OPERATOR B]
The room temperature

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.972 position:50% align:center
is continuing to rise.

00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:44.474 position:50% align:center
[RESEARCHER C]
What are they doing?

00:03:44.557 --> 00:03:45.433 position:50% align:center
[OPERATOR A]
We're monitoring them,

00:03:45.517 --> 00:03:47.477 position:50% align:center
but there's been no change.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.439 position:50% align:center
You won't on my watch.
I promise I'll protect you.

00:03:51.523 --> 00:03:53.775 position:50% align:center
Even though you may
be a Haijima spy,

00:03:53.858 --> 00:03:55.985 position:50% align:center
you've helped me out before.

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.155 position:50% align:center
We definitely would hate to
lose you back at the 8th.

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.116 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] They put their lives
on the line for a friend

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:03.034 position:50% align:center
without hesitation.

00:04:03.118 --> 00:04:05.787 position:50% align:center
That's what makes them the 8th.

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.163 position:50% align:center
It's weird.

00:04:07.247 --> 00:04:08.957 position:50% align:center
I don't know if it's because
I've been there so long,

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.711 position:50% align:center
but that feeling's
rubbed off on me.

00:04:12.794 --> 00:04:14.546 position:50% align:center
Maybe I should just go with it.

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:18.425 position:50% align:center
Kurono, listen to me.
You need to head over to Nataku.

00:04:18.508 --> 00:04:19.718 position:50% align:center
[OPERATORS gasp]

00:04:24.556 --> 00:04:25.849 position:50% align:center
--Stop that!
--Shinra!

00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:27.892 position:50% align:center
You don't have to play along
with all this anymore!

00:04:27.976 --> 00:04:29.519 position:50% align:center
Let's get outta here!

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:33.523 position:50% align:center
[RESEARCHER C]
No you don't!

00:04:34.816 --> 00:04:38.361 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but I just can't be taken
down by a fellow nerd, okay?

00:04:38.445 --> 00:04:40.447 position:50% align:center
[SECURITY GUARD B]
Uh! Grab him!

00:04:41.781 --> 00:04:42.741 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:04:42.824 --> 00:04:45.285 position:50% align:center
Nataku has been here all along.

00:04:45.368 --> 00:04:48.413 position:50% align:center
And it sounds like his Adolla
Burst has awakened.

00:04:50.373 --> 00:04:52.417 position:50% align:center
I knew they were
hiding something!

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.587 position:50% align:center
That was a real cry for help
through the Adolla Link.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.381 position:50% align:center
Company 8's gotta
protect him now!

00:05:04.929 --> 00:05:07.223 position:50% align:center
What's going on here?

00:05:10.852 --> 00:05:12.812 position:50% align:center
The 8th has broken
into the facility.

00:05:12.896 --> 00:05:15.315 position:50% align:center
Don't let them get to Nataku!

00:05:15.398 --> 00:05:17.233 position:50% align:center
Special Fire Force?

00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:21.154 position:50% align:center
There's bound to be a few
weaklings in that bunch.

00:05:21.237 --> 00:05:24.824 position:50% align:center
The first order of business
is to take them out.

00:05:26.951 --> 00:05:29.329 position:50% align:center
Do you know where they might be?

00:05:29.412 --> 00:05:31.873 position:50% align:center
Vulcan, eyes forward.

00:05:31.956 --> 00:05:33.458 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN] You talkin'
'bout that little doll?

00:05:33.541 --> 00:05:35.293 position:50% align:center
I'll just run it over!

00:05:37.462 --> 00:05:39.547 position:50% align:center
[IRIS, TAMAKI scream]

00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:43.009 position:50% align:center
Launch Spider Wire!

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.647 position:50% align:center
Is everyone okay?

00:05:57.607 --> 00:05:58.983 position:50% align:center
[MAKI]
What was that?

00:06:02.987 --> 00:06:06.324 position:50% align:center
Enemy detected.
Tekkyo's been deployed.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.870 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me it's all
because of that thing.

00:06:10.954 --> 00:06:12.288 position:50% align:center
[MAKI]
What do you mean?

00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:14.958 position:50% align:center
I mean, that tiny guy just
flipped over the Matchbox.

00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:18.920 position:50% align:center
How can it be so small
and so powerful?

00:06:19.004 --> 00:06:20.839 position:50% align:center
What kinda crazy,
souped-up generator

00:06:20.922 --> 00:06:23.049 position:50% align:center
is Haijima puttin' in there?

00:06:23.133 --> 00:06:26.803 position:50% align:center
Look! See that? There are
cables leading off of it.

00:06:30.473 --> 00:06:34.519 position:50% align:center
Oh, my goodness. We have some
surprise guests here today.

00:06:34.602 --> 00:06:36.104 position:50% align:center
I've been baby-sitting
the kiddos,

00:06:36.187 --> 00:06:38.273 position:50% align:center
since they're scared
of mean ol' Kurono.

00:06:38.356 --> 00:06:39.649 position:50% align:center
And now it looks like
I'll be teaching

00:06:39.733 --> 00:06:42.110 position:50% align:center
the Fire Force
some manners, too.

00:06:43.695 --> 00:06:46.322 position:50% align:center
You know why I wear this
cute Angel belt buckle?

00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:48.324 position:50% align:center
Because I'm a nice lady!

00:06:48.408 --> 00:06:50.952 position:50% align:center
Okay. I got your back, Maki.

00:06:51.036 --> 00:06:55.373 position:50% align:center
I'm not about to be shown up
by some stupid Haijima mech.

00:06:55.457 --> 00:06:56.875 position:50% align:center
Now, Dominions.

00:06:56.958 --> 00:07:00.128 position:50% align:center
It's time to play a little game
with our grown-up friends!

00:07:01.921 --> 00:07:03.089 position:50% align:center
So where is Nataku?

00:07:03.173 --> 00:07:05.759 position:50% align:center
They said he's in the
special care room.

00:07:05.842 --> 00:07:09.304 position:50% align:center
[SECURITY GUARD C] We gotta make
sure they don't get to the kid.

00:07:09.387 --> 00:07:10.430 position:50% align:center
Hear that?

00:07:10.513 --> 00:07:12.974 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Yeah. Guess he's over this way.

00:07:13.058 --> 00:07:14.309 position:50% align:center
Whoa.

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:17.520 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:07:17.604 --> 00:07:20.815 position:50% align:center
[KURONO] You should know better
than to do that to the guards.

00:07:20.899 --> 00:07:24.402 position:50% align:center
Ow. Please. Let me go!

00:07:25.737 --> 00:07:28.323 position:50% align:center
You didn't make it in time.

00:07:28.406 --> 00:07:29.824 position:50% align:center
Sputter, Flare, go!

00:07:29.908 --> 00:07:32.911 position:50% align:center
--[SPUTTER] Sputter, sputter...!
--[FLARE] Flare, flare...!

00:07:32.994 --> 00:07:35.288 position:50% align:center
Pow!

00:07:35.372 --> 00:07:37.916 position:50% align:center
She knocked them away?

00:07:37.999 --> 00:07:39.959 position:50% align:center
How 'bout now?

00:07:41.961 --> 00:07:43.880 position:50% align:center
The thing shot 'em?

00:07:45.298 --> 00:07:48.718 position:50% align:center
Let 'er rip one more time.
Fire Poot-Poot Blaster!

00:07:48.802 --> 00:07:50.220 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Poot-Poot Blaster?

00:07:50.303 --> 00:07:53.223 position:50% align:center
[DOMINION A]
Poo! Whee!

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:59.270 position:50% align:center
That is just crude.
I do not wanna get hit by it.

00:07:59.354 --> 00:08:02.357 position:50% align:center
Come now, the kiddos
absolutely love that one.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:03.858 position:50% align:center
You would think that
the Fire Force,

00:08:03.942 --> 00:08:07.445 position:50% align:center
the heroes of kids all over
the Empire, would know that.

00:08:07.529 --> 00:08:09.572 position:50% align:center
Dominions and I heard there
were some frowns here

00:08:09.656 --> 00:08:11.199 position:50% align:center
that needed to be
turned upside down,

00:08:11.282 --> 00:08:12.742 position:50% align:center
so we came running!

00:08:12.826 --> 00:08:15.954 position:50% align:center
Do you really wanna make those
poor, sweet children cry again?

00:08:16.037 --> 00:08:17.288 position:50% align:center
Well, the Fire Force
came runnin'

00:08:17.372 --> 00:08:19.749 position:50% align:center
because we heard you were
abusin' those children.

00:08:19.833 --> 00:08:23.211 position:50% align:center
I'm not gonna fall for
your crap! You hear me?

00:08:24.671 --> 00:08:26.131 position:50% align:center
So your cute little mechs,

00:08:26.214 --> 00:08:28.842 position:50% align:center
surely they have
a name, don't they?

00:08:28.925 --> 00:08:31.011 position:50% align:center
What?

00:08:31.094 --> 00:08:33.847 position:50% align:center
Open your ears.
I asked for their name.

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:36.891 position:50% align:center
They're the Twin Hover
Units--called Tekkyo!

00:08:36.975 --> 00:08:38.852 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIONS LADY]
No, that's way too complicated.

00:08:38.935 --> 00:08:41.271 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN] Too complicated
for who, exactly?

00:08:41.354 --> 00:08:44.566 position:50% align:center
That's too hard for the children
to follow, silly goose.

00:08:44.649 --> 00:08:48.653 position:50% align:center
Now... let me see.

00:08:48.737 --> 00:08:52.323 position:50% align:center
Going by the way they look,
it'd be better to call 'em...

00:08:52.407 --> 00:08:53.908 position:50% align:center
Ooh! "Caterpillies"!

00:08:53.992 --> 00:08:55.910 position:50% align:center
[MAKI]
That's adorable! I love it!

00:08:55.994 --> 00:08:57.370 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
Hell no!

00:08:57.454 --> 00:08:58.329 position:50% align:center
Why not?

00:08:58.413 --> 00:08:59.497 position:50% align:center
It's still an animal name,

00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:01.332 position:50% align:center
so I really don't see
any kinda problem.

00:09:01.416 --> 00:09:03.668 position:50% align:center
There's obviously a
huge problem here.

00:09:03.752 --> 00:09:05.754 position:50% align:center
Listen, namin' a mech
after a living creature

00:09:05.837 --> 00:09:09.007 position:50% align:center
helps grant the inorganic mech
a kinda--how would you say this?

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:11.176 position:50% align:center
I don't know... Kinda charm.

00:09:11.259 --> 00:09:13.595 position:50% align:center
That's the whole reason
for givin' 'em a name!

00:09:13.678 --> 00:09:15.764 position:50% align:center
But "Caterpillies" is just
out of the question!

00:09:15.847 --> 00:09:17.223 position:50% align:center
It doesn't fit the image!

00:09:17.307 --> 00:09:19.934 position:50% align:center
It's a mech--there's no
reason for it to be cutesy.

00:09:20.018 --> 00:09:21.019 position:50% align:center
It needs to have strength

00:09:21.102 --> 00:09:22.854 position:50% align:center
and a certain kinda
cool detachment!

00:09:22.937 --> 00:09:26.316 position:50% align:center
In that sense, Tekkyo the
Iron Owl is the perfect name!

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:28.902 position:50% align:center
Ugh. An annnoying otaku.

00:09:28.985 --> 00:09:30.236 position:50% align:center
--[MAKI] Mh-hm.
--[VULCAN] Wha--?!

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.073 position:50% align:center
Mech's about dreams!
You just don't get it.

00:09:33.156 --> 00:09:35.283 position:50% align:center
Anyone who calls a mech
"buddy" or "little guy"

00:09:35.367 --> 00:09:36.618 position:50% align:center
will never get it!

00:09:36.701 --> 00:09:38.036 position:50% align:center
And anyone who gives a mech
a precious, girly name

00:09:38.119 --> 00:09:39.496 position:50% align:center
has got somethin'
wrong with 'em!

00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:40.372 position:50% align:center
A sicko!

00:09:40.455 --> 00:09:41.873 position:50% align:center
What's the harm?

00:09:41.956 --> 00:09:44.209 position:50% align:center
If you give your mech a cute
name and treat it with love,

00:09:44.292 --> 00:09:46.711 position:50% align:center
it'll surely return it
right back to you.

00:09:46.795 --> 00:09:48.713 position:50% align:center
And if you build your
relationship on trust,

00:09:48.797 --> 00:09:51.132 position:50% align:center
it'll perform better than
you ever even imagined!

00:09:51.216 --> 00:09:52.467 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
That's the most ridiculous thing

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:53.718 position:50% align:center
I've heard in my life!

00:09:53.802 --> 00:09:55.553 position:50% align:center
You make it sound all
mystical! It's gross!

00:09:55.637 --> 00:09:57.389 position:50% align:center
Mechs are tools and
machines for us to use;

00:09:57.472 --> 00:09:59.265 position:50% align:center
they're not supposed
to be our friends!

00:09:59.349 --> 00:10:00.850 position:50% align:center
You treat 'em right
by maintaining them

00:10:00.934 --> 00:10:03.061 position:50% align:center
so they don't just suddenly
break down on you.

00:10:03.144 --> 00:10:05.480 position:50% align:center
Otherwise, you're just
gonna be disappointed.

00:10:05.563 --> 00:10:07.774 position:50% align:center
Well, people can
disappoint you, too.

00:10:07.857 --> 00:10:10.360 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's why I build
my relationships of trust

00:10:10.443 --> 00:10:11.653 position:50% align:center
with real people!

00:10:11.736 --> 00:10:12.987 position:50% align:center
You've got this, man.

00:10:13.071 --> 00:10:15.782 position:50% align:center
We're gonna go get
Shinra outta there.

00:10:17.617 --> 00:10:20.870 position:50% align:center
That is exactly the kinda
thing I'm talkin' about!

00:10:20.954 --> 00:10:22.580 position:50% align:center
Now give us back our guys!

00:10:22.664 --> 00:10:25.500 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, but you're the one
who really doesn't understand.

00:10:25.583 --> 00:10:27.502 position:50% align:center
It's not so much that
I try to treat my mech

00:10:27.585 --> 00:10:29.379 position:50% align:center
as if they were people.

00:10:29.462 --> 00:10:32.382 position:50% align:center
It's that I see mech and
people as being the same.

00:10:32.465 --> 00:10:34.259 position:50% align:center
Especially true for kids!

00:10:34.342 --> 00:10:36.219 position:50% align:center
[MAKI]
What's that mean?

00:10:36.302 --> 00:10:39.055 position:50% align:center
If you entertain some kids,
then they will be happy.

00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:41.099 position:50% align:center
Be mean to them
and they get angry.

00:10:41.182 --> 00:10:43.059 position:50% align:center
Their actions are
so predictable,

00:10:43.143 --> 00:10:44.978 position:50% align:center
which makes them
easy to control.

00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:46.312 position:50% align:center
So in that way,

00:10:46.396 --> 00:10:48.857 position:50% align:center
mech and children are both
like tools for adults.

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:50.942 position:50% align:center
[SPUTTER] Sputter, sputter,
sputter, sputte, sputter!

00:10:51.026 --> 00:10:53.445 position:50% align:center
[FLARE]
Flare, flare, flare, flare!

00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:57.866 position:50% align:center
She's making it look so easy.

00:10:57.949 --> 00:10:59.451 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
I get it.

00:10:59.534 --> 00:11:02.495 position:50% align:center
I'm willin' to bet that this
lady's a third generation.

00:11:02.579 --> 00:11:04.372 position:50% align:center
That's the only logical way
I can see her gettin'

00:11:04.456 --> 00:11:07.042 position:50% align:center
that much power outta such
a tiny little machine.

00:11:07.125 --> 00:11:08.585 position:50% align:center
[SPUTTER] Sputter, sputter,
sputter, sputter!

00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:10.712 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN] As long as she has
the upper hand in that regard,

00:11:10.795 --> 00:11:12.464 position:50% align:center
there's no point
in this kinda fight.

00:11:12.547 --> 00:11:16.259 position:50% align:center
[MAKI] Maybe, but she can't
just treat the kids like that.

00:11:19.179 --> 00:11:21.139 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIONS LADY] Okay, I think
I've collected enough data

00:11:21.222 --> 00:11:22.932 position:50% align:center
on their Caterpillies.

00:11:23.016 --> 00:11:24.184 position:50% align:center
Their power output's stable

00:11:24.267 --> 00:11:27.062 position:50% align:center
and their firepower
is fairly consistent.

00:11:27.145 --> 00:11:28.813 position:50% align:center
So she must be a
second generation

00:11:28.897 --> 00:11:30.648 position:50% align:center
who can only control flames.

00:11:30.732 --> 00:11:33.943 position:50% align:center
Which means my Dominions
have the advantage here.

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:38.656 position:50% align:center
What are we gonna do?

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:39.949 position:50% align:center
Take both Tekkyo

00:11:40.033 --> 00:11:41.951 position:50% align:center
and put everything you
have into one big hit!

00:11:42.035 --> 00:11:43.244 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:43.328 --> 00:11:45.789 position:50% align:center
Sounds like an
excellent idea, Vulcan.

00:11:45.872 --> 00:11:48.958 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIONS LADY] Dominions
and I have already won.

00:11:50.794 --> 00:11:54.005 position:50% align:center
Goodness, there they go,
running away.

00:11:57.676 --> 00:12:00.679 position:50% align:center
[MAKI] Tekkyo switching
to Fire Scene Mode!

00:12:03.014 --> 00:12:06.059 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
Charge superthermal power!

00:12:06.142 --> 00:12:11.523 position:50% align:center
Jet throttle circuits now
online. All ports are open.

00:12:11.606 --> 00:12:15.110 position:50% align:center
Sanchin-style launch
ready now!

00:12:15.193 --> 00:12:20.198 position:50% align:center
Twin unit coordinates locked!
Engines powered to full!

00:12:20.281 --> 00:12:24.577 position:50% align:center
Maximum thrust in
three, two, one.

00:12:24.661 --> 00:12:26.538 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIONS LADY] Going by
this configuration of data,

00:12:26.621 --> 00:12:29.833 position:50% align:center
I can figure out their
critical power.

00:12:29.916 --> 00:12:31.292 position:50% align:center
And what do you know?

00:12:31.376 --> 00:12:33.670 position:50% align:center
Little Dominions and I are
still totally in the clear!

00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:35.046 position:50% align:center
All my time watching children

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:37.173 position:50% align:center
and I've never once
been surprised.

00:12:37.257 --> 00:12:39.300 position:50% align:center
And you two are just
like a couple of kids,

00:12:39.384 --> 00:12:41.469 position:50% align:center
absolutely predictable.

00:12:41.553 --> 00:12:45.724 position:50% align:center
Dominions, blast
another Poot-Poot!

00:12:45.807 --> 00:12:49.185 position:50% align:center
All right! We're at
critical power! Let's go!

00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:52.731 position:50% align:center
Tekkyo maximum output!

00:12:52.814 --> 00:12:54.899 position:50% align:center
And 90... A hundred.

00:12:54.983 --> 00:12:58.445 position:50% align:center
It's better than I expected,
but not good enough.

00:12:58.528 --> 00:13:01.197 position:50% align:center
Violent but Deadly
Poot-Poot Blaster!

00:13:01.281 --> 00:13:04.159 position:50% align:center
[DOMINION A]
Poo! Whee!

00:13:04.242 --> 00:13:06.578 position:50% align:center
--[SPUTTER] Sputter, sputter...!
--[FLARE] Flare, flare...!

00:13:06.661 --> 00:13:09.706 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIONS LADY] That's it! Keep
on coming and get wiped out!

00:13:09.789 --> 00:13:12.459 position:50% align:center
[DOMINION A]
Whee!

00:13:12.542 --> 00:13:15.795 position:50% align:center
Come on, Sputter and Flare!
You've got this!

00:13:22.927 --> 00:13:24.387 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:24.471 --> 00:13:30.018 position:50% align:center
Output 100. Now 110, 120.
And still climbing?

00:13:30.101 --> 00:13:31.603 position:50% align:center
[SPUTTER]
Sputter, sputter...!

00:13:31.686 --> 00:13:33.146 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIONS LADY]
150?

00:13:33.229 --> 00:13:34.606 position:50% align:center
You gotta be kidding!

00:13:34.689 --> 00:13:38.943 position:50% align:center
You're not just up against
a mech, lady. We're humans!

00:13:39.027 --> 00:13:42.739 position:50% align:center
[MAKI] This is Vulcan's mech,
no way we're gonna lose.

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:52.123 position:50% align:center
Where were those little guys
hiding all that power?

00:13:52.207 --> 00:13:55.085 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
That was awesome, Maki!

00:13:55.168 --> 00:13:57.879 position:50% align:center
You, too, Tekkyo!

00:13:57.962 --> 00:13:59.964 position:50% align:center
I can't believe how
reckless you both are.

00:14:00.048 --> 00:14:01.216 position:50% align:center
I mean, if you had lost,

00:14:01.299 --> 00:14:03.677 position:50% align:center
you would've been blown
into tiny little pieces.

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:05.178 position:50% align:center
Does that mean you somehow knew

00:14:05.261 --> 00:14:06.846 position:50% align:center
everything would
turn out this way?

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:10.058 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't call it
"knowledge." It was trust.

00:14:10.141 --> 00:14:11.768 position:50% align:center
That's it, all right.

00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:13.853 position:50% align:center
I knew the numbers
were against us,

00:14:13.937 --> 00:14:15.689 position:50% align:center
but I believed Maki could do it.

00:14:15.772 --> 00:14:16.940 position:50% align:center
I trusted she could
beat the odds

00:14:17.023 --> 00:14:18.650 position:50% align:center
because she's kick
ass like that!

00:14:18.733 --> 00:14:20.026 position:50% align:center
Same for me.

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:23.655 position:50% align:center
I believed in his plan,
and Tekkyo, too, of course.

00:14:26.324 --> 00:14:27.617 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:14:27.701 --> 00:14:30.704 position:50% align:center
Wow. Color me surprised.

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:33.707 position:50% align:center
We should go find the others.

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:36.001 position:50% align:center
Copy that. Let's go!

00:14:38.753 --> 00:14:42.590 position:50% align:center
Now wait a tic. Our playtime
isn't over yet, you sillies!

00:14:42.674 --> 00:14:43.883 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:45.552 --> 00:14:48.179 position:50% align:center
What makes you think
you've beat me?

00:14:48.263 --> 00:14:50.348 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:14:52.726 --> 00:14:53.935 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:14:54.019 --> 00:14:57.522 position:50% align:center
We just had a hell of
a time with one of 'em!

00:14:57.605 --> 00:15:00.275 position:50% align:center
The name should've let you
know there was more than one.

00:15:00.358 --> 00:15:04.779 position:50% align:center
Dominions, right?
It's like so obviously plural.

00:15:13.621 --> 00:15:15.582 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Licht, what's your 20?

00:15:15.665 --> 00:15:17.584 position:50% align:center
Hey, Licht, come in!

00:15:17.667 --> 00:15:18.918 position:50% align:center
[click]

00:15:19.002 --> 00:15:21.755 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Captain, we're in
the special care room--

00:15:21.838 --> 00:15:24.758 position:50% align:center
Currently engaging
Haijima staff in combat.

00:15:24.841 --> 00:15:26.301 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
What's the building look like?

00:15:26.384 --> 00:15:32.015 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Sorry, Captain--but
because of--visibility is poor.

00:15:32.098 --> 00:15:33.850 position:50% align:center
"Visibility's poor"?

00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:38.313 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Northwest from the--the gate.

00:15:38.396 --> 00:15:39.898 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA]
Hmm.

00:15:40.899 --> 00:15:43.360 position:50% align:center
Shinra! Licht!

00:15:44.444 --> 00:15:45.653 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
Black smoke?

00:15:45.737 --> 00:15:47.572 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Keep back, all right?

00:15:47.655 --> 00:15:49.282 position:50% align:center
[KURONO]
Get out of my way.

00:15:49.366 --> 00:15:53.411 position:50% align:center
I wanna get a crack at that
skinny guy behind you.

00:15:53.495 --> 00:15:54.871 position:50% align:center
Captain Obi!

00:15:54.954 --> 00:15:57.749 position:50% align:center
Hey, Licht, get over there.

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:06.341 position:50% align:center
Okay. We're here.
You guys all right?

00:16:06.424 --> 00:16:07.759 position:50% align:center
Yeah, we're fine.

00:16:07.842 --> 00:16:09.594 position:50% align:center
We were able to find Nataku,

00:16:09.678 --> 00:16:13.098 position:50% align:center
but this Haijima
freak got him first.

00:16:13.181 --> 00:16:14.849 position:50% align:center
Ah, so this is Company 8.

00:16:14.933 --> 00:16:18.478 position:50% align:center
Please! Let me go!
I haven't done anything!

00:16:20.522 --> 00:16:23.191 position:50% align:center
Not doing anything
isn't good enough!

00:16:23.274 --> 00:16:27.487 position:50% align:center
You gotta get fired
up! Fire it up!

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:29.906 position:50% align:center
It's in you! Now let's see it!

00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:32.742 position:50% align:center
[OBI] Your days of
abusing kids are over.

00:16:32.826 --> 00:16:34.452 position:50% align:center
Let the boy go.

00:16:34.536 --> 00:16:38.164 position:50% align:center
You may call my methods
abuse, but it's my job.

00:16:38.248 --> 00:16:39.874 position:50% align:center
Stay behind me, Iris!

00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:41.167 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:16:43.503 --> 00:16:46.548 position:50% align:center
[KURONO] I'm surprised to see
such a frail, weak thing

00:16:46.631 --> 00:16:48.800 position:50% align:center
in the Fire Force.

00:16:51.594 --> 00:16:52.554 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
What the--?

00:16:52.637 --> 00:16:53.972 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
Try not to breathe it in!

00:16:56.016 --> 00:16:57.642 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
I'll protect you!

00:17:00.353 --> 00:17:03.773 position:50% align:center
Why would you shelter the weak?
It's a waste of time.

00:17:03.857 --> 00:17:06.192 position:50% align:center
You're sick!
What is wrong with you?

00:17:06.276 --> 00:17:08.236 position:50% align:center
[KURONO]
I have a simple philosophy.

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:10.947 position:50% align:center
"Crush the weak so the
strong may thrive."

00:17:11.031 --> 00:17:14.075 position:50% align:center
That's how the whole
world should operate.

00:17:14.159 --> 00:17:16.995 position:50% align:center
[INCA] Oh, yeah.
Everybody's in one place.

00:17:17.078 --> 00:17:20.790 position:50% align:center
And just as I predicted,
we've found the Sixth Pillar.

00:17:20.874 --> 00:17:21.958 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:17:22.042 --> 00:17:23.752 position:50% align:center
Look at that.

00:17:23.835 --> 00:17:25.420 position:50% align:center
Which one is the Sixth Pillar?

00:17:25.503 --> 00:17:27.756 position:50% align:center
[INCA] I still don't know
why you came along.

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:29.591 position:50% align:center
Like, shouldn't you
be with Haumea?

00:17:29.674 --> 00:17:31.092 position:50% align:center
Technically, I should.

00:17:31.176 --> 00:17:35.680 position:50% align:center
She's my Pillar, and I swore
an oath to be her protector.

00:17:35.764 --> 00:17:41.186 position:50% align:center
Alas, she got annoyed with me
earlier and told me to get lost.

00:17:41.269 --> 00:17:42.937 position:50% align:center
[INCA]
Sounds normal to me.

00:17:43.021 --> 00:17:46.107 position:50% align:center
My dad and I actually went
through the same exact thing.

00:17:46.191 --> 00:17:49.069 position:50% align:center
Kinda too bad he died
before I got over it.

00:17:49.152 --> 00:17:50.987 position:50% align:center
[CHARON] So you're saying
that all girls your age

00:17:51.071 --> 00:17:52.572 position:50% align:center
go through this sort of thing?

00:17:52.655 --> 00:17:54.157 position:50% align:center
That's rough.

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:55.784 position:50% align:center
[INCA] But none of that means
you had to tag along with me.

00:17:55.867 --> 00:17:58.870 position:50% align:center
You coulda just waited quietly
until she needed you.

00:17:58.953 --> 00:18:02.248 position:50% align:center
[CHARON] So you don't want me
hanging around either, Inca?

00:18:02.332 --> 00:18:04.209 position:50% align:center
[RITSU]
That's pretty obvious, Charon.

00:18:04.292 --> 00:18:07.462 position:50% align:center
After all, I'm here to
keep Miss Inca safe.

00:18:08.838 --> 00:18:11.091 position:50% align:center
I'm her protector maid.

00:18:11.174 --> 00:18:13.134 position:50% align:center
Look, Ritsu,
we're both protectors.

00:18:13.218 --> 00:18:15.929 position:50% align:center
Let's work together and
guard the new Pillar, okay?

00:18:16.012 --> 00:18:19.099 position:50% align:center
Be quiet, you oaf. I only take
orders from my mistress.

00:18:19.182 --> 00:18:21.476 position:50% align:center
Uh. Say what?

00:18:21.559 --> 00:18:25.021 position:50% align:center
Fine. Stay here and
watch over Inca.

00:18:25.105 --> 00:18:26.690 position:50% align:center
Which one's the next Pillar?

00:18:26.773 --> 00:18:30.110 position:50% align:center
[INCA] It's the little brat
being held by the creep.

00:18:32.237 --> 00:18:35.198 position:50% align:center
We can finally have
some fun again.

00:18:35.281 --> 00:18:37.492 position:50% align:center
It's showtime.

00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:41.371 position:50% align:center
You'd better stop
treating Nataku so rough.

00:18:41.454 --> 00:18:43.373 position:50% align:center
[KURONO]
I'm only gonna warn you once.

00:18:43.456 --> 00:18:47.711 position:50% align:center
If you're strong, get outta here
and leave the weak ones behind.

00:18:50.296 --> 00:18:51.297 position:50% align:center
You again?

00:18:51.381 --> 00:18:54.259 position:50% align:center
The Sixth Pillar
belongs to us now!

00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:59.514 position:50% align:center
[KURONO]
Didn't even faze him!

00:19:01.182 --> 00:19:03.351 position:50% align:center
[CHARON]
Clap!

00:19:03.435 --> 00:19:04.352 position:50% align:center
Grab the Sixth Pillar!

00:19:04.436 --> 00:19:05.437 position:50% align:center
[CHARON'S MAN A]
Sir!

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:08.732 position:50% align:center
No! Please! Let me go!
Somebody, help!

00:19:08.815 --> 00:19:11.943 position:50% align:center
What are all these
White-Clad doing here?

00:19:12.027 --> 00:19:14.904 position:50% align:center
[KURONO] And why don't
my blades hurt him?

00:19:16.406 --> 00:19:17.907 position:50% align:center
[KURONO]
The hell's going on?

00:19:17.991 --> 00:19:19.534 position:50% align:center
No one invited you, Charon!

00:19:19.617 --> 00:19:21.995 position:50% align:center
Sorry, fire-rat,
but you're wrong.

00:19:22.078 --> 00:19:24.164 position:50% align:center
I'm here to claim
the Sixth Pillar.

00:19:24.247 --> 00:19:27.959 position:50% align:center
But how did you know there
would be an Adolla Burst here?

00:19:28.043 --> 00:19:29.836 position:50% align:center
I know... Inca.

00:19:29.919 --> 00:19:31.004 position:50% align:center
[INCA]
Hello!

00:19:31.087 --> 00:19:32.297 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
I knew it!

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:33.590 position:50% align:center
[INCA] Let's watch a whole
crap load of people

00:19:33.673 --> 00:19:35.300 position:50% align:center
die again together!

00:19:35.383 --> 00:19:37.093 position:50% align:center
Please don't stand
so close to the edge.

00:19:37.177 --> 00:19:38.511 position:50% align:center
It's dangerous, Mistress.

00:19:38.595 --> 00:19:41.139 position:50% align:center
[INCA]
You're such a worrywart, Ritsu.

00:19:41.222 --> 00:19:43.308 position:50% align:center
Ya know, it's too much.

00:19:43.391 --> 00:19:45.852 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't sweat
the small stuff.

00:19:52.275 --> 00:19:56.613 position:50% align:center
Oh. Yeah. Because there's
real danger everywhere.

00:19:59.449 --> 00:20:01.910 position:50% align:center
How are we supposed to take on
this many of these things?

00:20:01.993 --> 00:20:04.371 position:50% align:center
It's probably better
that we run.

00:20:04.454 --> 00:20:06.498 position:50% align:center
Don't be such a party pooper.

00:20:06.581 --> 00:20:10.585 position:50% align:center
I've got a special puppet
show just for you!

00:20:10.669 --> 00:20:11.961 position:50% align:center
[DOMINIONS LADY screams]

00:20:14.297 --> 00:20:17.467 position:50% align:center
Aww! What have you done
to my poor Dominions?

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:20.095 position:50% align:center
Haijima stuff sure is crappy!

00:20:20.178 --> 00:20:22.472 position:50% align:center
[ARROW] If you had let me
snipe them from far away,

00:20:22.555 --> 00:20:24.599 position:50% align:center
we wouldn't have to risk
having you so close

00:20:24.683 --> 00:20:26.559 position:50% align:center
and out in the open like this.

00:20:26.643 --> 00:20:29.104 position:50% align:center
Well, you're protecting me
instead of little Sho today,

00:20:29.187 --> 00:20:30.814 position:50% align:center
so you just gotta deal with it.

00:20:30.897 --> 00:20:32.607 position:50% align:center
We clear, Arrow?

00:20:32.691 --> 00:20:34.442 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
Ugh, White-Clad?

00:20:34.526 --> 00:20:36.736 position:50% align:center
That plasma user's bad news.

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:40.198 position:50% align:center
We need Arthur ASAP,
or things'll get ugly.

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:46.121 position:50% align:center
Aw, rats. She destroyed them
like it was child's play.

00:20:46.204 --> 00:20:48.123 position:50% align:center
How's that for some irony?

00:20:48.206 --> 00:20:50.667 position:50% align:center
[HAUMEA] We're here to grab
Nataku, the Sixth Pillar,

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:52.419 position:50% align:center
and nobody is gonna stop us.

00:20:52.502 --> 00:20:56.256 position:50% align:center
Not you, or your creep-tastic
toys, ya feel me?

00:20:56.339 --> 00:20:58.091 position:50% align:center
Did nobody teach you
it's a big no-no

00:20:58.174 --> 00:20:59.759 position:50% align:center
to break other people's things?

00:20:59.843 --> 00:21:01.970 position:50% align:center
What a naughty
little girl you are.

00:21:02.053 --> 00:21:05.015 position:50% align:center
Heh. I think this grandma
here is about to snap.

00:21:05.098 --> 00:21:08.268 position:50% align:center
C'mon, Arrow, take a shot
at a fellow meemaw.

00:21:08.351 --> 00:21:11.771 position:50% align:center
I can hold them off a while.
Go get Arthur.

00:21:13.273 --> 00:21:15.191 position:50% align:center
I'll leave the Tekkyo here.

00:21:15.275 --> 00:21:16.735 position:50% align:center
But they're gonna need
time to cool down

00:21:16.818 --> 00:21:18.695 position:50% align:center
before we can use 'em again.

00:21:23.408 --> 00:21:24.534 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:21:24.617 --> 00:21:28.788 position:50% align:center
I think we can safely
say playtime's over.

00:21:28.872 --> 00:21:32.292 position:50% align:center
It's time to teach someone
how to mind her manners.

00:21:32.375 --> 00:21:36.880 position:50% align:center
Now, ready? Punisher
Dominion, I need you!

00:22:38.775 --> 00:22:41.069 position:50% align:center
That one is so much bigger!

00:24:19.042 --> 00:24:20.669 position:50% align:center
[IRIS]
As the battle between the 8th,

00:24:20.752 --> 00:24:23.588 position:50% align:center
Haijima's forces, and
the White-Clad unfolds,

00:24:23.672 --> 00:24:25.632 position:50% align:center
Ritsu's ability puts
sweet little Nataku

00:24:25.715 --> 00:24:27.258 position:50% align:center
in a bad situation.

00:24:27.342 --> 00:24:30.220 position:50% align:center
I think this is getting
way too scary!

00:24:30.303 --> 00:24:33.056 position:50% align:center
[KURONO]
Time for a new job.

00:24:33.139 --> 00:24:34.974 position:50% align:center
[IRIS]
Next time on <i>Fire Force</i> ,
