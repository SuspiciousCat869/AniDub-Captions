00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.491 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN IN BLACK]
I hear your plea,

00:00:33.575 --> 00:00:37.245 position:50% align:center
and I would help... if I could.

00:00:37.328 --> 00:00:38.788 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA gasps]

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:44.711 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN IN BLACK] However...
my power is... all but depleted.

00:00:44.794 --> 00:00:51.134 position:50% align:center
If I lent you Grace, it would
last for... but a second.

00:00:54.346 --> 00:00:57.932 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN IN BLACK] What could
you do in a single second?

00:01:00.393 --> 00:01:06.858 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN IN BLACK] Such a trifling
gift would be... useless.

00:01:25.168 --> 00:01:27.962 position:50% align:center
One second is all
the time I need.

00:03:08.897 --> 00:03:10.690 position:50% align:center
Shinra, you gonna
leave me hanging?

00:03:10.774 --> 00:03:11.983 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:13.234 --> 00:03:15.153 position:50% align:center
[OGUN]
Hurry up, man!

00:03:18.448 --> 00:03:20.533 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Just one second.

00:03:25.288 --> 00:03:27.332 position:50% align:center
Such a short time.

00:03:27.415 --> 00:03:32.796 position:50% align:center
Tell me, what will
you do in one second?

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.006 position:50% align:center
I'll protect the forest.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.926 position:50% align:center
The feeling I get from you
reminds me of Adolla--

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:39.886 position:50% align:center
of the Evangelist.

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:43.098 position:50% align:center
So who exactly are you?

00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:48.395 position:50% align:center
Who am I? One who is
no different than you.

00:03:48.478 --> 00:03:50.438 position:50% align:center
Do not fear.

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:53.900 position:50% align:center
You told the creatures
here that you had come

00:03:53.983 --> 00:03:56.403 position:50% align:center
to "create this world anew."

00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:58.988 position:50% align:center
Then what's the
Evangelist trying to do?

00:04:00.573 --> 00:04:02.367 position:50% align:center
What she wants.

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:10.375 position:50% align:center
Her final goal... is to perform
a terrible and arcane act.

00:04:10.458 --> 00:04:17.966 position:50% align:center
One that would engulf this land
in fire, destroying everything.

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:23.013 position:50% align:center
All I have done is to
create a place of refuge.

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:28.184 position:50% align:center
One that will last until the
destruction that she seeks

00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:30.812 position:50% align:center
comes to fruition.

00:04:30.895 --> 00:04:32.981 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Destroying the Earth with fire?

00:04:33.064 --> 00:04:35.567 position:50% align:center
That's what Rekka
was talking about.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.528 position:50% align:center
The time is growing
ever more thin.

00:04:38.611 --> 00:04:41.156 position:50% align:center
I shall grant you Grace.

00:04:54.836 --> 00:04:57.047 position:50% align:center
Ogun, I'm ready now!

00:05:18.526 --> 00:05:20.528 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA yells]

00:05:23.615 --> 00:05:25.200 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
When I link with Grace,

00:05:25.283 --> 00:05:28.870 position:50% align:center
my body basically breaks
down into particles.

00:05:28.953 --> 00:05:32.707 position:50% align:center
As I go beyond light speed,
time runs backwards.

00:05:32.791 --> 00:05:36.336 position:50% align:center
The particles reassemble to
how they were in the past.

00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:54.562 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
These images...

00:05:54.646 --> 00:05:57.857 position:50% align:center
Are they Tempe's memories?

00:05:57.941 --> 00:06:01.027 position:50% align:center
Why am I the only one?

00:06:01.111 --> 00:06:03.071 position:50% align:center
Why me?

00:06:07.951 --> 00:06:12.080 position:50% align:center
The Great Cataclysm took away
everything I held dear.

00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:16.835 position:50% align:center
All my wealth, my property,
and my family.

00:06:16.918 --> 00:06:20.714 position:50% align:center
Why am I the sole survivor?

00:06:20.797 --> 00:06:23.842 position:50% align:center
I hate it! Damn the
Great Cataclysm!

00:06:23.925 --> 00:06:26.511 position:50% align:center
It's stripped away
my status, my family,

00:06:26.594 --> 00:06:29.431 position:50% align:center
and worst of all, my fortune!

00:06:36.646 --> 00:06:38.690 position:50% align:center
I'm here.

00:06:40.775 --> 00:06:44.112 position:50% align:center
[TEMPE] I've arrived
at the spatial rift.

00:06:49.075 --> 00:06:50.785 position:50% align:center
It feels rigid.

00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:54.039 position:50% align:center
Is there not any way for
me to move beyond it?

00:06:54.122 --> 00:06:59.127 position:50% align:center
What if what lies ahead is a
place forbidden to humankind?

00:07:01.212 --> 00:07:03.214 position:50% align:center
What's left for me?

00:07:06.718 --> 00:07:07.969 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:13.475 --> 00:07:16.895 position:50% align:center
Somebody came through. But how?

00:07:16.978 --> 00:07:21.316 position:50% align:center
Who? Or... what?

00:07:21.399 --> 00:07:23.985 position:50% align:center
What are you?

00:07:25.653 --> 00:07:28.823 position:50% align:center
[TEMPE]
Wait, could it be?

00:07:28.907 --> 00:07:31.868 position:50% align:center
You're... You're God?

00:07:31.951 --> 00:07:34.204 position:50% align:center
That's it!

00:07:34.287 --> 00:07:35.789 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
The Evangelist.

00:07:35.872 --> 00:07:38.375 position:50% align:center
Dear God, you've seen
the hardships I've endured

00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:40.293 position:50% align:center
and you've crossed over
to the earthly plane

00:07:40.377 --> 00:07:42.420 position:50% align:center
to grant me your blessing.

00:07:42.504 --> 00:07:45.715 position:50% align:center
The Great Cataclysm has cost
me my status and wealth.

00:07:45.799 --> 00:07:48.426 position:50% align:center
Please bless me with that
kind of joy once again.

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:51.596 position:50% align:center
I beseech you.
Please, hear my prayer.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:56.101 position:50% align:center
Grant me the salvation
I so desperately crave!

00:07:56.184 --> 00:07:58.061 position:50% align:center
I am ready!

00:08:00.689 --> 00:08:03.566 position:50% align:center
[TEMPE groaning]

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:08.655 position:50% align:center
[screaming]

00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:15.537 position:50% align:center
[TEMPE]
I have received God's blessing.

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:19.749 position:50% align:center
The pain! The burning!
It's magnificent!

00:08:19.833 --> 00:08:22.293 position:50% align:center
Now I shall become
a god as well,

00:08:22.377 --> 00:08:26.923 position:50% align:center
and proclaim the greatness
of the highest deity!

00:08:27.007 --> 00:08:30.760 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] So the Evangelist came
through the spatial rift, too.

00:08:30.844 --> 00:08:34.681 position:50% align:center
Anyway, this man Tempe
here is beyond hope.

00:08:34.764 --> 00:08:38.768 position:50% align:center
Return to the great
flame... of fire!

00:08:38.852 --> 00:08:41.855 position:50% align:center
[TEMPE screams]

00:08:53.908 --> 00:08:56.244 position:50% align:center
Uh. What happened?

00:08:56.327 --> 00:08:57.746 position:50% align:center
[OGUN]
Where's the demon?

00:08:57.829 --> 00:09:00.665 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT]
I don't see Shinra either.

00:09:00.749 --> 00:09:04.002 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI] Did he take out
the demon that quickly?

00:09:04.085 --> 00:09:08.840 position:50% align:center
Oh, man. Adolla Bursts are
so powerful, it's crazy.

00:09:10.133 --> 00:09:13.261 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Looks like I got
way outside of the forest.

00:09:13.345 --> 00:09:15.638 position:50% align:center
I need to get back
to the others.

00:09:20.685 --> 00:09:24.481 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] If the Evangelist did
come from beyond the rift,

00:09:24.564 --> 00:09:27.233 position:50% align:center
does that mean she
isn't from our world?

00:09:29.444 --> 00:09:32.364 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN IN BLACK] Fire Soldier,
in just one second...

00:09:32.447 --> 00:09:35.116 position:50% align:center
...you wiped out the demon.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.495 position:50% align:center
I was told that you came
from beyond the rift as well.

00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:42.499 position:50% align:center
And there's something that
reminds me of the Evangelist.

00:09:42.582 --> 00:09:45.210 position:50% align:center
Are you a being
from Adolla, too?

00:09:45.293 --> 00:09:47.712 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN IN BLACK] You sense
that for I've spent ages

00:09:47.796 --> 00:09:52.425 position:50% align:center
inside the Tabernacle,
enkindled by an Adolla Burst.

00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:54.010 position:50% align:center
The longer I burned,

00:09:54.094 --> 00:09:58.223 position:50% align:center
the more intense the
"presence" of Adolla became.

00:09:58.306 --> 00:10:02.102 position:50% align:center
I began my life
as a human being.

00:10:02.185 --> 00:10:07.399 position:50% align:center
No different than you
or the demon Tempe.

00:10:10.193 --> 00:10:13.905 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN IN BLACK] I was set
alight with an Adolla Burst

00:10:13.988 --> 00:10:16.616 position:50% align:center
from one of the
Evangelist's insects.

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:21.996 position:50% align:center
She and I traveled
to this world together.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.832 position:50% align:center
You want to know--

00:10:23.915 --> 00:10:27.711 position:50% align:center
to find the connection between
me and the Evangelist.

00:10:27.794 --> 00:10:29.587 position:50% align:center
But know this:

00:10:29.671 --> 00:10:33.717 position:50% align:center
I'm merely someone she
brought here on a whim.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:37.637 position:50% align:center
There's nothing more
to it than that.

00:10:37.721 --> 00:10:41.307 position:50% align:center
I did repair the Tabernacle,

00:10:41.391 --> 00:10:43.977 position:50% align:center
but it was already
established here

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:49.482 position:50% align:center
250 years ago,
when I first arrived.

00:10:49.566 --> 00:10:54.154 position:50% align:center
The animals living here,
they were in agony.

00:10:54.237 --> 00:10:58.324 position:50% align:center
I used the Tabernacle's
energy to create an oasis

00:10:58.408 --> 00:11:00.493 position:50% align:center
where they could
live their lives

00:11:00.577 --> 00:11:05.290 position:50% align:center
surrounded by tranquil
beauty and peace.

00:11:05.373 --> 00:11:10.420 position:50% align:center
Since ancient times, mankind
has established many religions,

00:11:10.503 --> 00:11:12.756 position:50% align:center
each envisioning
different interpretations

00:11:12.839 --> 00:11:16.968 position:50% align:center
of Heaven and Hell,
God and the Devil.

00:11:19.763 --> 00:11:22.140 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN IN BLACK] Though they
hail from different lands,

00:11:22.223 --> 00:11:26.811 position:50% align:center
speak different languages, they
share certain commonalities.

00:11:26.895 --> 00:11:30.440 position:50% align:center
All have concepts
of gods and demons,

00:11:30.523 --> 00:11:34.194 position:50% align:center
personifications
of good and evil.

00:11:35.653 --> 00:11:39.115 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN IN BLACK] If this
is true, and all religions

00:11:39.199 --> 00:11:44.162 position:50% align:center
that have existed in this world
are based on visions of Adolla,

00:11:44.245 --> 00:11:47.457 position:50% align:center
ones that she has shown others,

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:51.211 position:50% align:center
then perhaps,
since ancient times--

00:11:51.294 --> 00:11:54.005 position:50% align:center
further back than
you could imagine--

00:11:54.089 --> 00:11:59.636 position:50% align:center
the Evangelist has been at work,
shaping mankind's ideologies.

00:11:59.719 --> 00:12:03.598 position:50% align:center
All from behind the
scenes of history.

00:12:03.682 --> 00:12:08.812 position:50% align:center
One could proclaim that the gods
humanity has dreamed of,

00:12:08.895 --> 00:12:13.608 position:50% align:center
those they have worshipped,
are merely her inventions.

00:12:18.905 --> 00:12:21.658 position:50% align:center
This is your enemy.

00:12:21.741 --> 00:12:27.247 position:50% align:center
The very being who created the
image of the deity you worship.

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:30.417 position:50% align:center
Your idea of God.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.836 position:50% align:center
So be warned.

00:12:32.919 --> 00:12:34.504 position:50% align:center
God, huh?

00:12:34.587 --> 00:12:35.964 position:50% align:center
No matter who it is,

00:12:36.047 --> 00:12:38.383 position:50% align:center
if they're bringing
calamity to this world,

00:12:38.466 --> 00:12:41.970 position:50% align:center
it's a Fire Soldier's
sworn duty to stop 'em.

00:12:43.555 --> 00:12:48.268 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN IN BLACK]
That creed is the reason...

00:12:48.351 --> 00:12:52.856 position:50% align:center
...why this forest
has been saved.

00:12:59.154 --> 00:13:03.366 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN IN BLACK] That won't
be forgotten. Thank you.

00:13:18.048 --> 00:13:20.633 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] That was some
ginormous explosion.

00:13:20.717 --> 00:13:21.259 position:50% align:center
Ogun.

00:13:21.343 --> 00:13:22.135 position:50% align:center
Sir?

00:13:22.218 --> 00:13:23.511 position:50% align:center
[PAN]
Everyone all right?

00:13:23.595 --> 00:13:26.806 position:50% align:center
Lieutenant Pan, we took care
of business out here.

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:29.642 position:50% align:center
In fact, Shinra just
put the demon to rest.

00:13:29.726 --> 00:13:30.727 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Hey!

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:32.896 position:50% align:center
Well, speak of the devil.

00:13:34.898 --> 00:13:36.149 position:50% align:center
Lieutenant Pan!

00:13:36.232 --> 00:13:39.235 position:50% align:center
So what's in there?
You done investigating?

00:13:39.319 --> 00:13:41.488 position:50% align:center
We hit the motherload.

00:13:51.873 --> 00:13:54.876 position:50% align:center
I don't hear her voice anymore.

00:13:54.959 --> 00:13:57.879 position:50% align:center
I wonder if she's
gone back to sleep.

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:02.217 position:50% align:center
Thanks to your help,
the demon's at rest.

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:03.760 position:50% align:center
I'm grateful.

00:14:06.638 --> 00:14:09.140 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Can't believe how
much we've learned here.

00:14:09.224 --> 00:14:12.352 position:50% align:center
This investigation's taken us
a giant leap forward.

00:14:12.435 --> 00:14:15.480 position:50% align:center
If Tokyo's Amaterasu
is set up the same way,

00:14:15.563 --> 00:14:18.983 position:50% align:center
then it'll also have a human
power source at the core.

00:14:19.067 --> 00:14:20.235 position:50% align:center
And that excites you?

00:14:20.318 --> 00:14:21.277 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Uh!

00:14:21.361 --> 00:14:23.238 position:50% align:center
Anyway... if Amaterasu's
power source

00:14:23.321 --> 00:14:25.115 position:50% align:center
comes from someone
with an Adolla Burst,

00:14:25.198 --> 00:14:26.908 position:50% align:center
then the Eight
Pillars would be...

00:14:26.991 --> 00:14:29.035 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Sacrifices.

00:14:29.119 --> 00:14:30.412 position:50% align:center
And if that's really the case,

00:14:30.495 --> 00:14:33.957 position:50% align:center
then the word "pillar"
fits perfectly.

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:35.834 position:50% align:center
We've been calling that
girl who linked with me

00:14:35.917 --> 00:14:38.378 position:50% align:center
the "First Pillar."

00:14:38.461 --> 00:14:41.840 position:50% align:center
If you're right, and there's
someone inside Amaterasu,

00:14:41.923 --> 00:14:45.468 position:50% align:center
then that girl, she could've
been a sacrifice.

00:14:46.594 --> 00:14:50.682 position:50% align:center
I got such an intense feeling
of burning hatred from her.

00:14:50.765 --> 00:14:54.686 position:50% align:center
She could hate humanity for
making her into a sacrifice.

00:14:54.769 --> 00:14:58.523 position:50% align:center
So she's not like the woman in
black inside the Tabernacle.

00:14:58.606 --> 00:15:03.194 position:50% align:center
Maybe it wasn't her choice.
She was forced against her will.

00:15:03.278 --> 00:15:06.281 position:50% align:center
Amaterasu was built
by the Holy Sol Temple

00:15:06.364 --> 00:15:08.158 position:50% align:center
and Haijima Industries.

00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:10.952 position:50% align:center
Seems like they're
hiding something.

00:15:11.036 --> 00:15:13.705 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Those eight arrows
we found at the core

00:15:13.788 --> 00:15:16.041 position:50% align:center
look to be some kinda keys.

00:15:17.167 --> 00:15:21.629 position:50% align:center
And Dr. Giovanni stole that
memory stick from Vulcan.

00:15:21.713 --> 00:15:24.716 position:50% align:center
Maybe that has info on
the "key" to Amaterasu.

00:15:24.799 --> 00:15:27.218 position:50% align:center
Like its own version
of those arrows.

00:15:27.302 --> 00:15:29.179 position:50% align:center
Could be, but this
series of numbers

00:15:29.262 --> 00:15:32.974 position:50% align:center
is a real head scratcher.

00:15:33.058 --> 00:15:34.601 position:50% align:center
Arthur says he thinks it's pi,

00:15:34.684 --> 00:15:39.189 position:50% align:center
but until we get back home to
Tokyo and we can verify that,

00:15:39.272 --> 00:15:42.067 position:50% align:center
can't say for sure,
and even if it is,

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:44.611 position:50% align:center
we still don't really know
if the two are related.

00:15:44.694 --> 00:15:46.946 position:50% align:center
Well, whatever the case,
I'm sure things are going

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:50.283 position:50% align:center
exactly how the
Evangelist wants.

00:15:50.367 --> 00:15:52.869 position:50% align:center
Sacrificing the eight
Adolla Bursts

00:15:52.952 --> 00:15:56.873 position:50% align:center
and using Amaterasu to kick off
another Great Cataclysm.

00:15:58.792 --> 00:16:01.628 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] We're starting to get
a clear picture of her goal,

00:16:01.711 --> 00:16:03.338 position:50% align:center
but I swear I will not let her

00:16:03.421 --> 00:16:06.007 position:50% align:center
wrap us around
her finger anymore.

00:16:06.091 --> 00:16:09.761 position:50% align:center
She may be God,
but I'm stopping her.

00:16:23.775 --> 00:16:24.859 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:26.277 --> 00:16:28.488 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA, ARTHUR, OGUN snoring]

00:16:41.001 --> 00:16:42.794 position:50% align:center
[YATA]
You're leaving already?

00:16:42.877 --> 00:16:45.380 position:50% align:center
Like, right now?
You can't stay longer?

00:16:45.463 --> 00:16:48.174 position:50% align:center
We heroes are busy people.

00:16:48.258 --> 00:16:50.385 position:50% align:center
Real heroes.

00:16:50.468 --> 00:16:52.470 position:50% align:center
You're really amazing, Shinra.

00:16:52.554 --> 00:16:57.100 position:50% align:center
I'm such a dang weakling.
I always have to ask for help.

00:16:57.183 --> 00:16:59.519 position:50% align:center
I can barely do
anything on my own.

00:16:59.602 --> 00:17:03.815 position:50% align:center
And I'm way too scared
to fight. I'm just a coward.

00:17:05.275 --> 00:17:07.235 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] What's too much
for you is too much for you,

00:17:07.318 --> 00:17:08.653 position:50% align:center
that's how it is.

00:17:08.737 --> 00:17:11.656 position:50% align:center
There's no reason to beat
yourself up about it.

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:14.993 position:50% align:center
Getting in over your head will
make you miserable anyway.

00:17:16.661 --> 00:17:19.873 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] All you wanted to do
is save the forest, right?

00:17:21.166 --> 00:17:24.252 position:50% align:center
Nothing wrong with asking people
to help you to do that.

00:17:24.336 --> 00:17:26.755 position:50% align:center
Matter of fact, being able
to face your weaknesses,

00:17:26.838 --> 00:17:29.466 position:50% align:center
and know what they are,
is its own kind of strength.

00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:31.968 position:50% align:center
And asking for help
takes courage.

00:17:36.097 --> 00:17:37.849 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
If things get rough,

00:17:37.932 --> 00:17:40.685 position:50% align:center
now you've got some
heroes to call on.

00:17:42.395 --> 00:17:43.855 position:50% align:center
[OGUN chuckles]

00:17:47.859 --> 00:17:50.737 position:50% align:center
I'll dig a thousand holes a day
to make myself stronger!

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:54.366 position:50% align:center
And if that doesn't get me
there, then I'll call for help!

00:17:56.368 --> 00:17:58.912 position:50% align:center
[SCOP]
See ya later!

00:18:02.499 --> 00:18:05.001 position:50% align:center
--[ALL] Hell yeah!
--[whistle blows]

00:18:05.085 --> 00:18:07.962 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] You guys really should
be wearing your masks, you know.

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.230 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
The First Pillar?

00:18:26.523 --> 00:18:29.776 position:50% align:center
Are you inside Amaterasu?

00:18:29.859 --> 00:18:32.278 position:50% align:center
Or wait...

00:18:32.362 --> 00:18:35.156 position:50% align:center
Are you Amaterasu, itself?

00:18:37.784 --> 00:18:39.160 position:50% align:center
[PAN]
Shinra.

00:18:41.204 --> 00:18:43.164 position:50% align:center
We're back in Tokyo, so get up.

00:18:43.248 --> 00:18:44.958 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Yes, sir.

00:18:47.419 --> 00:18:50.255 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] That girl showed up
in my dreams again.

00:18:55.844 --> 00:18:58.054 position:50% align:center
I guess your mom and dad
are relieved now, huh?

00:18:58.138 --> 00:19:01.266 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT] Yep! I told them
all about Scop and the others.

00:19:01.349 --> 00:19:03.184 position:50% align:center
All 'em critters is
back in the oasis,

00:19:03.268 --> 00:19:04.477 position:50% align:center
so they ain't got no dang reason

00:19:04.561 --> 00:19:06.229 position:50% align:center
to go and raid our
taters no more.

00:19:06.312 --> 00:19:07.772 position:50% align:center
Everything's peachy.

00:19:07.856 --> 00:19:09.649 position:50% align:center
If we knew their
bellies was rumblin',

00:19:09.733 --> 00:19:12.652 position:50% align:center
we coulda just slid 'em over
some taters, doncha know?

00:19:12.736 --> 00:19:13.820 position:50% align:center
[whistle blows]

00:19:13.903 --> 00:19:15.071 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm glad you got
to see your folks.

00:19:15.155 --> 00:19:16.239 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT]
Me, too.

00:19:16.322 --> 00:19:17.574 position:50% align:center
And the potatoes were
doing really good!

00:19:17.657 --> 00:19:19.826 position:50% align:center
I wanted way more adventure.

00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:21.786 position:50% align:center
I want more giggle gas.

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:23.079 position:50% align:center
[whistle blows]

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:26.374 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
That girl from my dream...

00:19:28.043 --> 00:19:31.004 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] She was surrounded
by all this evaporating water.

00:19:31.087 --> 00:19:33.548 position:50% align:center
And it looked like
she was crying.

00:19:35.717 --> 00:19:39.846 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Amaterasu...
I wonder who she really is.

00:19:40.889 --> 00:19:42.557 position:50% align:center
If it's true that there's
actually someone

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.809 position:50% align:center
inside Amaterasu,

00:19:44.893 --> 00:19:46.394 position:50% align:center
it means there's a contradiction

00:19:46.478 --> 00:19:48.355 position:50% align:center
in the scripture of
the Holy Sol Temple,

00:19:48.438 --> 00:19:51.649 position:50% align:center
which has guided
the Tokyo Empire.

00:19:51.733 --> 00:19:54.277 position:50% align:center
Remember what the prologue says?

00:19:54.361 --> 00:19:59.074 position:50% align:center
"Many years ago, mankind
faced a divine fury."

00:20:03.995 --> 00:20:07.957 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Many years ago,
mankind faced a divine fury.

00:20:08.041 --> 00:20:10.919 position:50% align:center
In an event known as
the Day of the Cataclysm,

00:20:11.002 --> 00:20:13.630 position:50% align:center
our entire world was burned.

00:20:13.713 --> 00:20:15.548 position:50% align:center
The fire raged with an intensity

00:20:15.632 --> 00:20:18.301 position:50% align:center
that threatened to
reduce mankind to ash.

00:20:18.385 --> 00:20:20.720 position:50% align:center
The places they lived,
the languages they spoke,

00:20:20.804 --> 00:20:25.642 position:50% align:center
the culture they had built,
none could escape its wrath.

00:20:25.725 --> 00:20:28.520 position:50% align:center
As the world man had
built was buried in ash,

00:20:28.603 --> 00:20:30.897 position:50% align:center
a leader appeared.

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:34.818 position:50% align:center
A man who would later be
known as Raffles the 1st.

00:20:34.901 --> 00:20:37.362 position:50% align:center
Raffles and his disciples
embarked on a quest

00:20:37.445 --> 00:20:40.281 position:50% align:center
to find new light, and they did.

00:20:40.365 --> 00:20:44.119 position:50% align:center
What Raffles found was
an unsullied flame.

00:20:44.202 --> 00:20:47.372 position:50% align:center
The spark that would
kindle an empire.

00:20:53.503 --> 00:20:56.089 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Raffles saw at once
that the unsullied flame

00:20:56.172 --> 00:20:58.008 position:50% align:center
was a gift from the Great Sol.

00:20:58.091 --> 00:21:01.052 position:50% align:center
He resolved to harness its
power with technology

00:21:01.136 --> 00:21:03.805 position:50% align:center
and created Amaterasu.

00:21:03.888 --> 00:21:06.391 position:50% align:center
By the light of
Amaterasu's sacred flame,

00:21:06.474 --> 00:21:08.727 position:50% align:center
the people began to rebuild.

00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:13.648 position:50% align:center
With its power, they established
a new state in the Far East.

00:21:28.329 --> 00:21:30.415 position:50% align:center
Catch you guys later!

00:21:50.727 --> 00:21:52.520 position:50% align:center
[bell chimes]

00:21:52.604 --> 00:21:55.023 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER A] Currently,
Amaterasu is operating

00:21:55.106 --> 00:21:57.192 position:50% align:center
at full efficiency.

00:22:01.446 --> 00:22:03.239 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Amaterasu was a driving force

00:22:03.323 --> 00:22:05.825 position:50% align:center
behind our country's
development.

00:22:05.909 --> 00:22:07.369 position:50% align:center
But...

00:22:07.452 --> 00:22:09.746 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] If it turns out the
Evangelist was actually the one

00:22:09.829 --> 00:22:12.665 position:50% align:center
who gave mankind
the Adolla Bursts...

00:22:14.125 --> 00:22:16.378 position:50% align:center
...then you could argue
that the Evangelist

00:22:16.461 --> 00:22:18.088 position:50% align:center
developed this country.

00:22:18.171 --> 00:22:21.383 position:50% align:center
So why would she be trying
to destroy it now?

00:22:22.342 --> 00:22:23.468 position:50% align:center
It's weird.

00:22:23.551 --> 00:22:24.678 position:50% align:center
Kinda makes you wonder

00:22:24.761 --> 00:22:27.722 position:50% align:center
if the Holy Sol Temple
is hiding something.

00:22:30.684 --> 00:22:33.645 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Let's go in and give
our report to Captain Obi.

[IRIS]
The city of Tokyo is swimming

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:23.797 position:50% align:center
with every manner of intrigue,
deceit, and corruption.

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:25.840 position:50% align:center
But there is one man
who risked life and limb

00:24:25.924 --> 00:24:27.509 position:50% align:center
to fight the forces of evil.

00:24:27.592 --> 00:24:30.387 position:50% align:center
Hey, Licht, what
is this all about?
