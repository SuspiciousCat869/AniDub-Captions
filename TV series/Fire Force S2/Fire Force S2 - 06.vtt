[OBI] Causes of death
are many and varied.

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:25.400 position:50% align:center
Old age. Illness. Suicide.

00:00:25.483 --> 00:00:27.193 position:50% align:center
But out of that long,
morbid list,

00:00:27.277 --> 00:00:30.905 position:50% align:center
there's one end that people
fear above all others.

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:35.994 position:50% align:center line:10%
[OBI]
Death by fire.

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:49.841 position:50% align:center
What is that? It looks
like a huge pillar of ice.

00:00:49.924 --> 00:00:52.385 position:50% align:center
What the hell is
happening right now?

00:00:53.762 --> 00:00:56.264 position:50% align:center
It's terrifying!

00:00:56.348 --> 00:00:58.308 position:50% align:center
You're the first person
that's been able to hurt me.

00:00:58.391 --> 00:01:00.727 position:50% align:center
That's quite an accomplishment.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.646 position:50% align:center
And you better believe
I'll do it again.

Charon. Time to make tracks.

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:15.950 position:50% align:center
The flames are dying down

00:01:16.034 --> 00:01:18.328 position:50% align:center
and the fire punks aren't
quite so busy anymore.

00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:20.955 position:50% align:center
So grab that Fifth
Pillar, won't ya?

Hang on!

00:01:37.263 --> 00:01:40.850 position:50% align:center
Did she just use magnetism
to slow down her fall?

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:44.229 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Hold it!

00:01:44.312 --> 00:01:47.232 position:50% align:center
I said the Fire Force
will take care of her.

Your name's Inca, right?

00:01:49.025 --> 00:01:51.820 position:50% align:center
You know you can use your power
to burn up those restraints.

00:01:51.903 --> 00:01:53.279 position:50% align:center
Come with me!

00:03:29.584 --> 00:03:30.794 position:50% align:center
[CHARON]
I figured out your strategy

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:33.838 position:50% align:center
is to try to go after
my counterattacks.

00:03:33.922 --> 00:03:35.965 position:50% align:center
And I won't fall for it again.

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:37.759 position:50% align:center
So what're you gonna do now?

00:03:37.842 --> 00:03:40.136 position:50% align:center
Better think fast.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.680 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
He's right.

00:03:41.763 --> 00:03:45.058 position:50% align:center
Since he knows what I'm doing,
I can't get the upper hand,

00:03:45.141 --> 00:03:47.435 position:50% align:center
and I can't just charge
at him blindly.

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.730 position:50% align:center
There's got to be some way
to get Inca outta here.

00:03:50.814 --> 00:03:51.898 position:50% align:center
Um, sir?

00:03:51.981 --> 00:03:53.858 position:50% align:center
Haumea keeps flooding
our brainwaves,

00:03:53.942 --> 00:03:55.402 position:50% align:center
telling us to hurry up!

00:03:55.485 --> 00:03:56.319 position:50% align:center
Let's go!

00:03:56.403 --> 00:03:58.530 position:50% align:center
Inca! Come on!

00:03:58.613 --> 00:04:02.534 position:50% align:center
I can help! Use your
power to break free!

00:04:05.036 --> 00:04:08.873 position:50% align:center
[INCA] I can wiggle my
finger and start a fire.

00:04:08.957 --> 00:04:12.919 position:50% align:center
Just trace the lines to
the end, and then, "boom."

00:04:13.003 --> 00:04:15.547 position:50% align:center
But I can't see those
lines right now.

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.634 position:50% align:center
Which means, I can't
start a fire, either.

00:04:19.718 --> 00:04:22.095 position:50% align:center
At least, not at this moment.

00:04:22.178 --> 00:04:24.264 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty sure my
ability lets me see

00:04:24.347 --> 00:04:27.183 position:50% align:center
what's going to happen
in the future.

00:04:28.518 --> 00:04:31.062 position:50% align:center
[INCA] It feels weird to
decide what to do now.

00:04:31.146 --> 00:04:33.940 position:50% align:center
I mean, I can tell
what's coming up next.

00:04:34.024 --> 00:04:37.318 position:50% align:center
And the lines just aren't
showing up for me.

00:04:37.402 --> 00:04:39.320 position:50% align:center
Which can only mean,

00:04:39.404 --> 00:04:42.115 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna go with
these sketchy guys,

00:04:42.198 --> 00:04:45.285 position:50% align:center
and I'm not gonna
put up any fight.

00:04:45.368 --> 00:04:47.704 position:50% align:center
These people kidnapped
my baby brother.

00:04:47.787 --> 00:04:49.664 position:50% align:center
Stole the life he should've had!

00:04:49.748 --> 00:04:51.958 position:50% align:center
You're not like them, Inca.

00:04:52.042 --> 00:04:54.044 position:50% align:center
[INCA]
He can say whatever he wants,

00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:57.339 position:50% align:center
but it doesn't matter because I
can see how it's gonna go down.

00:04:57.422 --> 00:04:59.132 position:50% align:center
They'll find out I'm
the Fireground Thief

00:04:59.215 --> 00:05:01.468 position:50% align:center
and there goes my freedom.

00:05:01.551 --> 00:05:04.220 position:50% align:center
Actually, I'm gonna
lose it either way.

00:05:08.391 --> 00:05:09.726 position:50% align:center
[INCA]
I get it.

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:11.269 position:50% align:center
If I take his hand,

00:05:11.353 --> 00:05:14.022 position:50% align:center
I'll definitely have
to pay for my crimes,

00:05:14.105 --> 00:05:18.318 position:50% align:center
but I'll still have a life
of safety waiting for me.

00:05:23.114 --> 00:05:24.908 position:50% align:center
[INCA] But if I go
with these other guys,

00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:28.078 position:50% align:center
it'll be a very different life.

00:05:33.291 --> 00:05:34.501 position:50% align:center

Hey!

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.295 position:50% align:center
I love danger.

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:40.715 position:50% align:center
And going with them will
give me plenty of that.

00:05:40.799 --> 00:05:44.302 position:50% align:center
What? Are you kidding?
Just look around you!

00:05:44.386 --> 00:05:46.221 position:50% align:center
This is what the White-Clads
were willing to do

00:05:46.304 --> 00:05:49.349 position:50% align:center
to get you in their clutches.

00:05:49.432 --> 00:05:51.267 position:50% align:center
People who were
desperate to live

00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:53.770 position:50% align:center

00:05:53.853 --> 00:05:55.480 position:50% align:center
And you're throwing yours away?

00:05:55.563 --> 00:05:58.233 position:50% align:center
What in the hell is the
matter with you, Inca?

00:05:58.316 --> 00:06:00.151 position:50% align:center
What do you take your life for?

00:06:00.235 --> 00:06:02.237 position:50% align:center
That won't work on me!

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.280 position:50% align:center
What happened isn't my business!

00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:06.908 position:50% align:center
And my life doesn't
belong to anyone else!

00:06:06.991 --> 00:06:09.327 position:50% align:center
Don't you dare compare
me to those losers!

00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:10.912 position:50% align:center
I'm not throwing it away!

00:06:10.995 --> 00:06:12.580 position:50% align:center
I'm doing what I
want to with it!

00:06:12.664 --> 00:06:14.124 position:50% align:center
I value my own life!

00:06:14.207 --> 00:06:16.251 position:50% align:center
That's why I love
danger so much, okay?!

00:06:16.334 --> 00:06:19.754 position:50% align:center

how much mine is worth to me!

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:12.672 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Yeah, we're coming'!

00:11:16.551 --> 00:11:18.219 position:50% align:center
[CITIZEN A]
Thank you!

00:11:19.763 --> 00:11:21.473 position:50% align:center
[CITIZEN B]
You're all so brave!

00:11:21.556 --> 00:11:24.100 position:50% align:center
[CITIZEN D] Without your help,
I'd be dead right now!

00:11:24.184 --> 00:11:25.769 position:50% align:center
[CITIZEN C]
We owe our lives to you!

00:11:25.852 --> 00:11:26.936 position:50% align:center
Yes, it's true!

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:28.855 position:50% align:center
You saved us all!

00:11:30.523 --> 00:11:31.983 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Captain Hague from the 4th

00:11:32.067 --> 00:11:35.028 position:50% align:center
told me about how seeing the
destruction from the Great Fire

00:11:35.111 --> 00:11:37.822 position:50% align:center
had changed him.

00:11:37.906 --> 00:11:40.408 position:50% align:center
How it made him realize
there were so many people

00:11:40.492 --> 00:11:43.620 position:50% align:center
whose lives he couldn't save.

00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:47.123 position:50% align:center
Still, the first time
I heard all the praise,

00:11:47.207 --> 00:11:49.668 position:50% align:center
it was like music to my ears.

00:11:57.926 --> 00:11:59.219 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] If the Evangelist
and the White-Clad

00:11:59.302 --> 00:12:03.264 position:50% align:center
had never existed,
could I have saved Inca?

00:12:03.348 --> 00:12:05.767 position:50% align:center
Would she have taken my hand?

00:12:17.612 --> 00:12:19.823 position:50% align:center
[PAN] Sir, I have the
report on the casualties

00:12:19.906 --> 00:12:24.411 position:50% align:center
from yesterday's fire:
19 dead, 58 injured.

00:12:24.494 --> 00:12:28.248 position:50% align:center
134 buildings were
lost in the blaze.

00:12:28.331 --> 00:12:30.208 position:50% align:center
In addition, the total
count on Infernals

00:12:30.291 --> 00:12:32.877 position:50% align:center
that were put to rest is 39.

00:12:35.338 --> 00:12:38.091 position:50% align:center
I can take small comfort
in those numbers.

00:12:38.174 --> 00:12:41.970 position:50% align:center
We could've had casualties
on par with the Great Fire.

00:12:42.053 --> 00:12:43.346 position:50% align:center
However...

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:46.307 position:50% align:center
Our company's response
was an embarrassment.

00:12:46.391 --> 00:12:49.019 position:50% align:center
We moved far too slowly.

00:12:50.687 --> 00:12:52.689 position:50% align:center
[ONYANGO] I understand the
8th is working on a plan

00:12:52.772 --> 00:12:55.400 position:50% align:center
to take on the Evangelist.

00:12:55.483 --> 00:12:57.986 position:50% align:center
[BURNS]
That sounds like Obi to me.

00:12:58.069 --> 00:13:01.781 position:50% align:center
We have our Holy Sol Temple
discipline tying our hands,

00:13:01.865 --> 00:13:04.826 position:50% align:center
in contrast to the 8th, where
there's no hardheaded cardinal

00:13:04.909 --> 00:13:06.786 position:50% align:center
slowing them down.

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:12.876 position:50% align:center
Is that so? I'll pretend
like I didn't hear that.

00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:15.503 position:50% align:center
Will the 1st aid
in their mission?

00:13:15.587 --> 00:13:18.256 position:50% align:center
[BURNS] Karim appears to have
been sneaking over to the 8th,

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:21.343 position:50% align:center
and Tamaki is there under the
pretext of being suspended.

00:13:21.426 --> 00:13:23.928 position:50% align:center
I don't believe there's
much more we can do.

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:26.973 position:50% align:center
[LI]
So, were all of the fires

00:13:27.057 --> 00:13:30.310 position:50% align:center
the other day
started artificially?

00:13:30.393 --> 00:13:31.728 position:50% align:center
[KARIM]
Yeah.

00:13:31.811 --> 00:13:34.981 position:50% align:center
By the ones responsible for
your arm and Rekka, yes.

00:13:37.734 --> 00:13:41.446 position:50% align:center
I wanna get payback
with revenge.

00:13:41.529 --> 00:13:45.784 position:50% align:center
My right arm is like a trial
bestowed upon me by God himself.

00:13:45.867 --> 00:13:48.286 position:50% align:center
Don't get too upset.

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:51.289 position:50% align:center
I've got one arm, but there're
still a lot of things I can do,

00:13:51.373 --> 00:13:53.333 position:50% align:center
except tent my hands.

00:13:53.416 --> 00:13:55.168 position:50% align:center
Although...

00:13:55.251 --> 00:13:57.629 position:50% align:center
Return to the great
flame of fire.

00:13:57.712 --> 00:13:59.214 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
<i>Látom.</i>

00:13:59.297 --> 00:14:01.091 position:50% align:center
[LI]
I've got you to help with that.

00:14:01.174 --> 00:14:02.467 position:50% align:center
[KARIM]
Come on, I feel guilty already

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:04.427 position:50% align:center
because I think it's my fault!

00:14:04.511 --> 00:14:07.889 position:50% align:center
[GUSTAV]
Oh! It's burning!

00:14:07.972 --> 00:14:09.391 position:50% align:center
Captain Honda, sir.

00:14:09.474 --> 00:14:11.518 position:50% align:center
Am I to understand we are
providing arrangements

00:14:11.601 --> 00:14:13.770 position:50% align:center
for the Imperial garrison?

00:14:13.853 --> 00:14:15.730 position:50% align:center
Given the 2nd's ties
to the military,

00:14:15.814 --> 00:14:19.526 position:50% align:center
we're in the best position
to move things quickly.

00:14:19.609 --> 00:14:23.029 position:50% align:center
Besides, we have a rookie here
who hails from the peninsula.

00:14:23.113 --> 00:14:24.781 position:50% align:center
He should be of help.

00:14:35.542 --> 00:14:37.335 position:50% align:center
[BOTH sigh]

00:14:44.551 --> 00:14:47.345 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI] Whew. I haven't
performed ablutions in a while.

00:14:47.429 --> 00:14:48.722 position:50% align:center
[IRIS]
You're doing well.

00:14:48.805 --> 00:14:50.974 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
You deserve the praise, Iris.

00:14:51.057 --> 00:14:54.019 position:50% align:center
Being the only Sister here
is a huge responsibility.

00:14:54.102 --> 00:14:57.522 position:50% align:center
Something could happen again,
where you'd need some backup.

00:14:57.605 --> 00:14:59.899 position:50% align:center
Know what I mean?
So I need to stay pure.

00:14:59.983 --> 00:15:02.569 position:50% align:center
So I can help with prayers
to put Infernals to rest.

00:15:02.652 --> 00:15:03.236 position:50% align:center
[IRIS gasps]

00:15:03.319 --> 00:15:04.446 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI yelps]

00:15:06.281 --> 00:15:09.367 position:50% align:center
That's like.. see through.

00:15:09.451 --> 00:15:12.912 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
Ah! Screw you!

00:15:12.996 --> 00:15:14.330 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
<i>Látom.</i>

00:15:14.414 --> 00:15:15.957 position:50% align:center
No, no.

00:15:17.792 --> 00:15:19.544 position:50% align:center
[JOKER]
So you're going, then?

00:15:19.627 --> 00:15:21.129 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
You betcha.

00:15:21.212 --> 00:15:23.048 position:50% align:center
Gonna see it with my own eyes.

00:15:23.131 --> 00:15:25.884 position:50% align:center
But holy smokes,
I'll be a busy bee.

00:15:25.967 --> 00:15:29.304 position:50% align:center
How will I ever decide what
I'm gonna bring with me?

00:15:29.387 --> 00:15:31.806 position:50% align:center
I'd love to make
the journey, too,

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:34.684 position:50% align:center
but I would never make it
past the checkpoints.

00:15:34.768 --> 00:15:38.271 position:50% align:center
You should've become a Fire
Soldier like me, Joker.

00:15:42.525 --> 00:15:45.195 position:50% align:center
An interesting idea.

00:15:45.278 --> 00:15:47.322 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I worked with
Hibana of the 5th

00:15:47.405 --> 00:15:49.240 position:50% align:center
and we made an educated guess.

00:15:49.324 --> 00:15:53.119 position:50% align:center
So I'll go there and
see what I can find out.

00:15:53.203 --> 00:15:55.455 position:50% align:center
[JOKER]
Heh.

00:15:55.538 --> 00:15:58.249 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA]
I've handed over my data.

00:15:58.333 --> 00:15:59.793 position:50% align:center
Hopefully, they're
able to figure out

00:15:59.876 --> 00:16:02.003 position:50% align:center
some lead on Adolla Bursts.

00:16:02.087 --> 00:16:05.507 position:50% align:center
As a scientist, it bothers me
that I have to stay back here,

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:07.759 position:50% align:center
but as captain,
I have obligations.

00:16:07.842 --> 00:16:10.345 position:50% align:center
No choice but to remain.

00:16:12.097 --> 00:16:13.848 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Listen up!

00:16:13.932 --> 00:16:15.100 position:50% align:center
It's new mission time.

00:16:15.183 --> 00:16:16.434 position:50% align:center
We're doin' a joint operation

00:16:16.518 --> 00:16:18.603 position:50% align:center
with some of the
other companies.

00:16:18.687 --> 00:16:21.189 position:50% align:center
The 8th will be sending
four of our crewmen.

00:16:21.272 --> 00:16:22.982 position:50% align:center
By that, I mean you four.

00:16:23.066 --> 00:16:26.528 position:50% align:center
A joint operation?
What'll we be doing?

00:16:26.611 --> 00:16:27.987 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Conducting an investigation

00:16:28.071 --> 00:16:30.824 position:50% align:center
into the Evangelist
and Adolla Bursts.

00:16:30.907 --> 00:16:33.243 position:50% align:center
The White-Clad have been busy
gathering what they call

00:16:33.326 --> 00:16:37.330 position:50% align:center
the "Eight Pillars," each of
whom possesses an Adolla Burst.

00:16:37.414 --> 00:16:39.541 position:50% align:center
We know who some of
them are already.

00:16:39.624 --> 00:16:41.418 position:50% align:center
For example,
Shinra and his brother

00:16:41.501 --> 00:16:43.378 position:50% align:center
have both been identified,

00:16:43.461 --> 00:16:45.755 position:50% align:center
but what was made clear
by Inca's emergence,

00:16:45.839 --> 00:16:48.633 position:50% align:center
is there are more
to be activated.

00:16:48.717 --> 00:16:51.428 position:50% align:center
Right now, we are only
aware of Shinra,

00:16:51.511 --> 00:16:54.514 position:50% align:center
Sho, Inca, and that Haumea.

00:16:54.597 --> 00:16:57.017 position:50% align:center
Those who serve the Evangelist
are trying to gather

00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:01.146 position:50% align:center
the Eight Pillars and their
Adolla Bursts for one goal:

00:17:01.229 --> 00:17:06.693 position:50% align:center
To once again trigger the Great
Cataclysm from 250 years ago.

00:17:17.328 --> 00:17:18.955 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
It was such a massive disaster,

00:17:19.039 --> 00:17:21.833 position:50% align:center
it changed the layout
of our world forever.

00:17:21.916 --> 00:17:24.544 position:50% align:center
I can't imagine why they'd
want that to happen again,

00:17:24.627 --> 00:17:28.465 position:50% align:center
but we have to do whatever
it takes to stop them.

00:17:28.548 --> 00:17:30.133 position:50% align:center
There's so much
that we don't know

00:17:30.216 --> 00:17:33.511 position:50% align:center
about what actually happened
during the Great Cataclysm.

00:17:33.595 --> 00:17:36.514 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, we've been
a step behind in preventing

00:17:36.598 --> 00:17:38.892 position:50% align:center
the White-Clad from finding
and capturing those

00:17:38.975 --> 00:17:40.685 position:50% align:center
who have an Adolla Burst.

00:17:40.769 --> 00:17:42.729 position:50% align:center
That's why we need
to find out more

00:17:42.812 --> 00:17:44.564 position:50% align:center
about that worldwide
catastrophe.

00:17:44.647 --> 00:17:45.982 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
The good news is,

00:17:46.066 --> 00:17:48.985 position:50% align:center
I've already figured out
the best starting point.

00:17:49.069 --> 00:17:51.696 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI] Okay. So
where are we going, sir?

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:53.073 position:50% align:center
Far away.

00:17:53.156 --> 00:17:56.493 position:50% align:center
Somewhere with unknown terrain
and unknown ecology.

00:17:56.576 --> 00:17:59.496 position:50% align:center
I mean, it's seriously unknown.

00:18:01.581 --> 00:18:02.791 position:50% align:center
--[LICHT] Huh?
--[TAMAKI gasps]

00:18:02.874 --> 00:18:08.296 position:50% align:center
The Chinese Peninsula!
Outside the Tokyo Empire.

00:18:14.969 --> 00:18:17.305 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Oh, yeah!

00:18:17.389 --> 00:18:18.682 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:18:18.765 --> 00:18:21.351 position:50% align:center
Kinda can't believe we're
getting away from Tokyo.

00:18:21.434 --> 00:18:24.521 position:50% align:center
I've always wondered what
the outside world is like.

00:18:35.115 --> 00:18:38.618 position:50% align:center
We're really gonna cross
the ocean in that!

00:18:38.702 --> 00:18:40.662 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
Kusakabe! Fall in!

00:18:40.745 --> 00:18:41.955 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Hm?

00:18:42.038 --> 00:18:43.623 position:50% align:center
Coming! Sorry!

00:18:43.707 --> 00:18:45.500 position:50% align:center
[whistle blows]

00:18:45.583 --> 00:18:48.169 position:50% align:center
[PAN] Is everyone here?
I'm taking roll call.

00:18:48.253 --> 00:18:53.508 position:50% align:center
[whistle blowing]

00:18:53.591 --> 00:18:55.176 position:50% align:center
[whistle blows]

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:58.847 position:50% align:center
Now then, we've been chosen
for a serious mission.

00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:01.599 position:50% align:center
As you know, the thrust
of this investigation

00:19:01.683 --> 00:19:06.229 position:50% align:center
is to discover clues about the
Evangelist and Adolla Bursts.

00:19:06.312 --> 00:19:10.775 position:50% align:center
Upon our findings, we,
the Special Fire Force, will...

00:19:10.859 --> 00:19:13.319 position:50% align:center
[whistle blowing]

00:19:13.403 --> 00:19:17.240 position:50% align:center
[OGUN] You gotta say the
important part out loud, sir!

00:19:17.323 --> 00:19:19.951 position:50% align:center
All right, please take
care of yourselves.

00:19:20.035 --> 00:19:22.746 position:50% align:center
I've known most of these crewmen
since their days at the Academy,

00:19:22.829 --> 00:19:25.457 position:50% align:center
so we can handle
whatever comes our way.

00:19:27.709 --> 00:19:29.753 position:50% align:center
Crewman Kotatsu.

00:19:29.836 --> 00:19:31.129 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Juggernaut,

00:19:31.212 --> 00:19:32.839 position:50% align:center
your family lives on the
Chinese Peninsula, right?

00:19:32.922 --> 00:19:37.093 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Actually, I grew up
on a potato farm over there.

00:19:37.177 --> 00:19:40.096 position:50% align:center
That's reason they chose me to
be the guide on this mission.

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:41.389 position:50% align:center
Although, honestly,

00:19:41.473 --> 00:19:43.516 position:50% align:center
I've never even been near
the place we're going,

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:46.436 position:50% align:center
so I'm really not too sure
how this is gonna work out.

00:19:46.519 --> 00:19:49.481 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you'll do
great. No sweat.

00:19:51.983 --> 00:19:54.652 position:50% align:center
I've never been inside
a ship before.

00:19:54.736 --> 00:19:57.822 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT]
Whoa! These are our potatoes!

00:19:57.906 --> 00:19:59.491 position:50% align:center
I had no idea it
was even possible

00:19:59.574 --> 00:20:01.368 position:50% align:center
to grow potatoes in a wasteland.

00:20:01.451 --> 00:20:02.869 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, totally!

00:20:02.952 --> 00:20:04.579 position:50% align:center
Potatoes are a super
high-yield crop

00:20:04.662 --> 00:20:07.540 position:50% align:center
that can thrive in the
harshest soil conditions.

00:20:07.624 --> 00:20:08.583 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Huh.

00:20:08.667 --> 00:20:09.918 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT]
The green skin and buds

00:20:10.001 --> 00:20:12.128 position:50% align:center
contain the glycoalkaloids
solanine and chaconine,

00:20:12.212 --> 00:20:14.464 position:50% align:center
which are poisonous, so you
gotta watch out for those.

00:20:14.547 --> 00:20:15.882 position:50% align:center
But they're rich in nutrients--

00:20:15.965 --> 00:20:18.635 position:50% align:center
Vitamin C, B-complexes,
potassium, and dietary fiber--

00:20:18.718 --> 00:20:19.844 position:50% align:center
so they're super healthy!

00:20:19.928 --> 00:20:21.221 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
You don't say...

00:20:21.304 --> 00:20:22.806 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT] If you're trying
to make potato starch,

00:20:22.889 --> 00:20:26.226 position:50% align:center
you can get about 15 grams from
around 100 grams of potatoes.

00:20:26.309 --> 00:20:27.769 position:50% align:center
You may be surprised
that calorie-wise,

00:20:27.852 --> 00:20:30.063 position:50% align:center
it only comes in at
a low 76 calories,

00:20:30.146 --> 00:20:32.816 position:50% align:center
which you can easily burn off
with 30 minutes of walking.

00:20:32.899 --> 00:20:34.442 position:50% align:center
And the flowers
are really pretty.

00:20:34.526 --> 00:20:36.736 position:50% align:center
They're white, or light purple,
and just looking at them

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:38.196 position:50% align:center
can make you really
happy, you know?

00:20:38.279 --> 00:20:39.239 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
I'll bet...

00:20:39.322 --> 00:20:40.824 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT]
Oh, and listen to this.

00:20:40.907 --> 00:20:43.368 position:50% align:center
Potatoes are actually-- Holy!
You scared the crap outta me.

00:20:43.451 --> 00:20:46.538 position:50% align:center
What are you doing down here?
We're about to shove off.

00:20:46.621 --> 00:20:48.331 position:50% align:center
They said we were free
to use the ship's cabins

00:20:48.415 --> 00:20:49.666 position:50% align:center
until we get there.

00:20:49.749 --> 00:20:52.544 position:50% align:center
So your instructor--meaning me--

00:20:52.627 --> 00:20:54.546 position:50% align:center
will pay respects
to the captain.

00:20:54.629 --> 00:20:56.172 position:50% align:center
Now tell the others, would ya?

00:20:56.256 --> 00:20:57.507 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA, JUGGERNAUT]
Roger.

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:01.177 position:50% align:center
You think we can go up
and check out the deck?

00:21:01.261 --> 00:21:03.096 position:50% align:center
The Imperial Armed
Forces are there.

00:21:03.179 --> 00:21:04.472 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid if we get too excited

00:21:04.556 --> 00:21:05.724 position:50% align:center
and run around
looking at everything,

00:21:05.807 --> 00:21:07.934 position:50% align:center
we're gonna get on their nerves.

00:21:08.018 --> 00:21:10.645 position:50% align:center
But once the ship takes
off, let's do it.

00:21:20.739 --> 00:21:22.490 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA gasps]

00:21:26.411 --> 00:21:27.746 position:50% align:center
Good luck!

00:21:27.829 --> 00:21:30.290 position:50% align:center
Make sure you follow Lieutenant
Pan's orders, got it?

00:21:30.373 --> 00:21:32.208 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Aye!

00:21:32.292 --> 00:21:34.627 position:50% align:center
Here we go!

00:21:43.428 --> 00:21:46.806 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Crazy, we're
actually leaving Tokyo.

00:21:58.985 --> 00:22:03.615 position:50% align:center
Whoa, so cool! We're
surrounded by the ocean!

00:22:03.698 --> 00:22:06.659 position:50% align:center
Huh? What's that?

00:22:06.743 --> 00:22:08.787 position:50% align:center
[OGUN]
Looks like a submarine volcano.

00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:11.206 position:50% align:center
Never even heard of that.

00:22:12.499 --> 00:22:14.084 position:50% align:center
[OGUN] Probably formed
all those years ago

00:22:14.167 --> 00:22:16.920 position:50% align:center
in the Great Cataclysm.

00:22:17.003 --> 00:22:19.255 position:50% align:center
The Great Cataclysm.

00:22:20.757 --> 00:22:22.592 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
It's such a mystery.

00:22:22.676 --> 00:22:26.096 position:50% align:center
But we're gonna find out
what happened way back then.

00:24:19.793 --> 00:24:21.503 position:50% align:center
[IRIS] The group leaves
the Tokyo Empire

00:24:21.586 --> 00:24:23.338 position:50% align:center
for the Chinese Peninsula.

00:24:23.421 --> 00:24:25.215 position:50% align:center
There, they run into
mysterious creatures

00:24:25.298 --> 00:24:27.550 position:50% align:center
in an unknown territory.

00:24:27.634 --> 00:24:30.220 position:50% align:center
Aw, I wish I could've
gone with them.

00:24:30.303 --> 00:24:32.389 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Whoa! Holy crap!

00:24:32.472 --> 00:24:34.557 position:50% align:center
I can actually see it now!

00:24:34.641 --> 00:24:36.226 position:50% align:center
[IRIS]
