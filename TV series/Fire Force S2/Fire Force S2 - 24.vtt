00:00:18.875 --> 00:00:21.417 align:middle
[OBI] Causes of death
are many and varied.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.833 align:middle
Old age. Illness. Suicide.

00:00:24.917 --> 00:00:26.625 align:middle
But out of that long,
morbid list,

00:00:26.708 --> 00:00:30.500 align:middle
there's one end that people
fear above all others...

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.292 align:middle line:7%
[OBI]
Death by fire.

00:00:39.375 --> 00:00:41.458 align:middle
[SHINRA, ARTHUR]
So hot!

00:00:43.083 --> 00:00:44.750 align:middle
Where did you go,
Captain Shinmon?!

00:00:44.833 --> 00:00:45.583 align:middle
You can't leave us here!

00:00:45.667 --> 00:00:46.667 align:middle
If I didn't know better,

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.958 align:middle
I'd think he's forgotten
all about us!

00:00:58.375 --> 00:01:00.208 align:middle
[sighs]

00:02:37.917 --> 00:02:42.917 align:middle
[SHINRA, ARTHUR yelling]

00:02:46.875 --> 00:02:48.292 align:middle
Come on!

00:02:48.375 --> 00:02:50.083 align:middle
We came here to train and
learn about Hysterical Strength!

00:02:50.167 --> 00:02:51.292 align:middle
But the only thing you've done

00:02:51.375 --> 00:02:53.542 align:middle
is torture us all day
and night, Captain!

00:02:53.625 --> 00:02:55.792 align:middle
What the hell's
the point of this?

00:02:56.833 --> 00:02:58.375 align:middle
If you don't mind me asking,

00:02:58.458 --> 00:03:00.125 align:middle
what is the point
of this, Captain?

00:03:00.208 --> 00:03:04.542 align:middle
I dunno. Proto-nationalist
hazing, really.

00:03:04.625 --> 00:03:07.208 align:middle
But to tap into the Hysterical
Strength of a Fire Scene,

00:03:07.292 --> 00:03:10.250 align:middle
you have to go
beyond your limits.

00:03:10.333 --> 00:03:11.875 align:middle
So this kind of
training is a part

00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:15.542 align:middle
of overcoming the limits
of one's own strength.

00:03:15.625 --> 00:03:18.500 align:middle
Konro did the same to
me when I was young.

00:03:18.583 --> 00:03:19.958 align:middle
Oh...

00:03:20.042 --> 00:03:24.333 align:middle
[KIDS laughing]

00:03:24.417 --> 00:03:27.375 align:middle
[yelling]

00:03:34.083 --> 00:03:36.750 align:middle
Hysterical Strength is
invaluable at a fire scene.

00:03:36.833 --> 00:03:38.000 align:middle
I'll say this:

00:03:38.083 --> 00:03:40.292 align:middle
When somebody can freely
use this power at will,

00:03:40.375 --> 00:03:43.042 align:middle
they become the pinnacle
of a <i>hikeshi</i> .

00:03:43.125 --> 00:03:45.833 align:middle
The captain of the 8th,
for example.

00:03:45.917 --> 00:03:49.125 align:middle
He's practically the embodiment
of Hysterical Strength.

00:03:49.208 --> 00:03:51.250 align:middle
I believe he's what every
<i>hikeshi</i> on the Force

00:03:51.333 --> 00:03:53.083 align:middle
should strive to be.

00:03:53.167 --> 00:03:54.875 align:middle
Our own Captain Obi?

00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.792 align:middle
Even though he may
technically be unpowered,

00:03:57.875 --> 00:03:59.417 align:middle
no one does what he can.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.625 align:middle
Hey! I don't think
this is help--

00:04:03.208 --> 00:04:03.875 align:middle
What is...

00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:04.792 align:middle
Please stop!

00:04:04.875 --> 00:04:05.458 align:middle
...the point...

00:04:05.542 --> 00:04:06.500 align:middle
Please stop!

00:04:06.583 --> 00:04:07.208 align:middle
...of this?

00:04:07.292 --> 00:04:08.167 align:middle
Please stop!

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.000 align:middle
What is...

00:04:09.083 --> 00:04:09.792 align:middle
[ARTHUR]
Please stop!

00:04:09.875 --> 00:04:10.875 align:middle
[SHINRA]
...the point?

00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.333 align:middle
[ARTHUR]
Please stop!

00:04:14.833 --> 00:04:17.000 align:middle
[SHINRA]
We've been roasted over a fire,

00:04:17.083 --> 00:04:21.167 align:middle
smoked on a cross,
dragged by a wagon,

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:26.375 align:middle
dipped naked into water,
headfirst, spun around...

00:04:26.458 --> 00:04:29.875 align:middle
So tell me, what's
the point of it all?

00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.708 align:middle
To reach your
Hysterical Strength,

00:04:31.792 --> 00:04:34.125 align:middle
you have to go far beyond
your furthest limits.

00:04:34.208 --> 00:04:36.208 align:middle
[SHINRA]
Right.

00:04:36.292 --> 00:04:38.500 align:middle
Konro said the same
thing back then.

00:04:38.583 --> 00:04:40.500 align:middle
And then what?

00:04:42.917 --> 00:04:47.000 align:middle
Hmm. There's gotta be some
reason for all this.

00:04:47.083 --> 00:04:49.208 align:middle
I never actually
found out, though.

00:04:49.292 --> 00:04:50.625 align:middle
[SHINRA]
"Huh?"

00:04:52.458 --> 00:04:54.750 align:middle
[BENIMARU]
Okay, let's do this.

00:04:54.833 --> 00:04:57.792 align:middle
There really wasn't a point to
all of that, was there, Captain?

00:04:57.875 --> 00:05:01.167 align:middle
Ugh, come on. Does every
small thing get to you?

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.958 align:middle
--[ARTHUR] Are you kidding me?
--[SHINRA] What in the hell?

00:05:03.042 --> 00:05:04.750 align:middle
--I will strike you down!
--You're abusing your power!

00:05:04.833 --> 00:05:05.833 align:middle
[BENIMARU]
Could be the hazing,

00:05:05.917 --> 00:05:08.958 align:middle
but you have a lot
of pent-up anger.

00:05:09.042 --> 00:05:10.250 align:middle
That's good.

00:05:10.333 --> 00:05:11.917 align:middle
I can actually feel
the breath of life

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.333 align:middle
in every one of your attacks.

00:05:13.417 --> 00:05:15.292 align:middle
I can sense that you're
really trying to kill me.

00:05:15.375 --> 00:05:16.458 align:middle
[SHINRA]
Of course!

00:05:16.542 --> 00:05:19.042 align:middle
Because we freakin'
hate you right now!

00:05:24.083 --> 00:05:25.958 align:middle
Kusakabe!

00:05:30.292 --> 00:05:32.542 align:middle
Brute! That's too much!

00:05:34.667 --> 00:05:37.042 align:middle
Anger just begets more anger.

00:05:37.125 --> 00:05:39.458 align:middle
If you've turned your
bloodlust on someone,

00:05:39.542 --> 00:05:42.833 align:middle
then you've guaranteed it'll
come right back on you.

00:05:45.583 --> 00:05:48.458 align:middle
I taught both of you
about the breath of life,

00:05:48.542 --> 00:05:51.875 align:middle
and the value of your friends'
and even your enemies' lives.

00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:56.125 align:middle
They're all important.
But you still don't get it.

00:05:58.458 --> 00:06:01.792 align:middle
Facing the fury of
a raging inferno...

00:06:01.875 --> 00:06:04.625 align:middle
...is like throwing yourselves
into the purifying flames

00:06:04.708 --> 00:06:06.375 align:middle
of the Immovable Lord.

00:06:06.458 --> 00:06:09.542 align:middle
The Wisdom King, Acala.

00:06:09.625 --> 00:06:12.833 align:middle
Fight or flight, let down
your guard and you die.

00:06:12.917 --> 00:06:15.292 align:middle
Your precious breath of life
instantly snuffed out

00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:18.000 align:middle
by Acala's flames.

00:06:18.083 --> 00:06:20.125 align:middle
What you feel next...

00:06:20.208 --> 00:06:23.292 align:middle
What's beyond the
breath of life is...

00:06:28.792 --> 00:06:33.458 align:middle
You had better look alive,
or Acala will strike you dead.

00:06:35.083 --> 00:06:38.375 align:middle
[SHINRA]
He's faster than my Rapid? How?

00:06:43.625 --> 00:06:45.958 align:middle
He took them both
down so easily.

00:06:46.042 --> 00:06:49.083 align:middle
Is that what Hysterical
Strength does for you?

00:06:49.167 --> 00:06:50.958 align:middle
--[SHINRA] We're not...
--[ARTHUR] ...done yet!

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.625 align:middle
[explosions]

00:06:56.708 --> 00:06:59.500 align:middle
[thudding]

00:07:24.458 --> 00:07:25.958 align:middle
I'm not done.

00:07:30.875 --> 00:07:32.833 align:middle
Not... yet...

00:07:32.917 --> 00:07:35.042 align:middle
They've been going
for five hours.

00:07:35.125 --> 00:07:38.333 align:middle
I think they've used up
all of their oxygen.

00:07:38.417 --> 00:07:40.708 align:middle
They're both starting
to black out.

00:07:40.792 --> 00:07:44.750 align:middle
If they don't stop right now,
they're gonna get tephrosis.

00:07:44.833 --> 00:07:47.125 align:middle
You got overheated, did you?

00:07:48.792 --> 00:07:50.750 align:middle
Excuse me, Captain Shinmon,

00:07:50.833 --> 00:07:52.667 align:middle
but isn't that enough
for one day?

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:56.417 align:middle
[BENIMARU] Enough? Heh.
We haven't even started yet.

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:58.292 align:middle
Huh?

00:07:58.375 --> 00:08:02.708 align:middle
Get up. Your training
begins now.

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:09.792 align:middle
Lieutenant Konro, you here?

00:08:09.875 --> 00:08:12.792 align:middle
What the--? It's the
captain of the 5th!

00:08:12.875 --> 00:08:15.458 align:middle
Is Waka supposed to be
training you today, too?

00:08:15.542 --> 00:08:17.042 align:middle
Don't be ridiculous.

00:08:17.125 --> 00:08:20.375 align:middle
A researcher like me doesn't
engage in such foolishness.

00:08:20.458 --> 00:08:23.125 align:middle
I was hoping you'd be gracious
enough to elaborate further

00:08:23.208 --> 00:08:25.625 align:middle
on that demon encounter
you had mentioned yesterday.

00:08:25.708 --> 00:08:30.708 align:middle
Oh? You're here to talk to me?
That "doppelganger" business?

00:08:30.792 --> 00:08:32.208 align:middle
Yes, that's correct.

00:08:32.292 --> 00:08:34.833 align:middle
I'd like to know more about it,
if you don't mind sharing.

00:08:34.917 --> 00:08:37.833 align:middle
You came all this way
to hear the story?

00:08:37.917 --> 00:08:40.958 align:middle
Honestly, I really don't know
what else to say about it.

00:08:41.042 --> 00:08:43.500 align:middle
Anyway, why don't you come in?

00:08:43.583 --> 00:08:47.500 align:middle
If you're short on words,
we can learn more another way.

00:08:47.583 --> 00:08:49.375 align:middle
Go ahead and enter.

00:08:49.458 --> 00:08:51.792 align:middle
You've brought someone
else with you?

00:08:53.083 --> 00:08:57.750 align:middle
I'm with Special Fire Force
Company 6. Captain Kayoko Huang.

00:08:57.833 --> 00:09:00.458 align:middle
Captain Huang, that's our man.

00:09:00.542 --> 00:09:02.208 align:middle
I'll start with palpation.

00:09:02.292 --> 00:09:04.458 align:middle
[KONRO]
What are they gonna do to me?

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:09.875 align:middle
Hey, I said "get up," so get up.

00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.667 align:middle
You haven't even started
training them yet?

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:14.208 align:middle
But won't it make
them get tephrosis

00:09:14.292 --> 00:09:15.750 align:middle
if you push them too far?

00:09:15.833 --> 00:09:17.292 align:middle
The entire point of my training

00:09:17.375 --> 00:09:19.667 align:middle
is to push them
beyond their limits.

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:21.333 align:middle
Now, get up!

00:09:26.167 --> 00:09:29.750 align:middle
I was never... gonna quit.

00:09:29.833 --> 00:09:35.417 align:middle
No, sir. No way in hell.

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:38.792 align:middle
That just sounds like
a bunch of tough talk to me.

00:09:49.417 --> 00:09:51.333 align:middle
At least quitting
is doing something.

00:09:51.417 --> 00:09:53.208 align:middle
Both of you are just
standing there.

00:09:53.292 --> 00:09:57.458 align:middle
[thudding]

00:09:57.542 --> 00:09:59.667 align:middle
What the hell is wrong with you?

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:04.208 align:middle
You move or else you die.
Your enemy won't wait around.

00:10:04.292 --> 00:10:08.500 align:middle
I'm well aware,
sir. Move or die.

00:10:18.792 --> 00:10:21.542 align:middle
[SHINRA]
I've used up all my oxygen.

00:10:21.625 --> 00:10:29.375 align:middle
I can't breathe. I can feel...
my life... burning away.

00:10:29.458 --> 00:10:34.000 align:middle
Everything's going
dark. I'm fading.

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:42.292 align:middle
[SHINRA]
A fire?

00:10:44.083 --> 00:10:46.875 align:middle
[SHINRA]
The purifying flame of Acala.

00:10:48.917 --> 00:10:51.375 align:middle
[SHINRA]
I'm at the scene of a fire.

00:10:51.458 --> 00:10:53.500 align:middle
Right in the middle of it.

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:56.000 align:middle
Shinra.

00:10:58.833 --> 00:11:00.417 align:middle
Shinra!

00:11:09.625 --> 00:11:12.208 align:middle
I'm back home?

00:11:12.292 --> 00:11:15.792 align:middle
But I was in... Asakusa.

00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:26.167 align:middle
[SHINRA]
Sho. Mom.

00:11:28.167 --> 00:11:31.583 align:middle
It's time to do or die.

00:11:31.667 --> 00:11:35.250 align:middle
Or else I'm gonna
lose them again.

00:11:35.333 --> 00:11:39.792 align:middle
[SHINRA] Life is precious.
It's irreplaceable.

00:11:39.875 --> 00:11:43.833 align:middle
Once it's gone,
you'll never get it back.

00:11:46.667 --> 00:11:50.708 align:middle
[SHINRA] My body is paralyzed
with fear. I can't move.

00:11:50.792 --> 00:11:53.375 align:middle
But if I don't, I'll die.

00:11:53.458 --> 00:11:57.208 align:middle
And then it's too late.
That's the end of my story.

00:11:57.292 --> 00:11:58.958 align:middle
It's all over.

00:12:00.583 --> 00:12:02.542 align:middle
[SHINRA]
Am I a coward?

00:12:02.625 --> 00:12:06.333 align:middle
The kind of person who'd just
let it end without fighting?

00:12:07.833 --> 00:12:10.000 align:middle
[SHINRA]
What choice do I have?

00:12:10.083 --> 00:12:14.125 align:middle
What can I do?
I've used up everything.

00:12:14.208 --> 00:12:16.208 align:middle
There's nothing left.

00:12:17.917 --> 00:12:20.167 align:middle
[SHINRA]
So what can I do?

00:12:24.417 --> 00:12:25.667 align:middle
[TAMAKI gasps]

00:12:30.083 --> 00:12:33.083 align:middle
[SHINRA]
Survival instinct.

00:12:33.167 --> 00:12:34.875 align:middle
My nerves.

00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:38.417 align:middle
The press of death
is making me smile.

00:12:39.917 --> 00:12:43.167 align:middle
[SHINRA]
A Pinch of Energy.

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:46.083 align:middle
What does the fear
of death give me?

00:13:00.792 --> 00:13:02.917 align:middle
And here come those flames.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.458 align:middle
Yeah, now we're
gettin' somewhere.

00:13:26.625 --> 00:13:28.583 align:middle
[KONRO]
You learn anything new?

00:13:28.667 --> 00:13:30.875 align:middle
[HUANG]
No, not really, and your flame,

00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:34.083 align:middle
it's no different from that
of other pyrokinetics.

00:13:34.167 --> 00:13:37.333 align:middle
And if your flame has
no unique characteristic,

00:13:37.417 --> 00:13:40.417 align:middle
something else must be
triggering the Adolla Link.

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:44.208 align:middle
Lieutenant Konro, both you
and Captain Hague from the 4th

00:13:44.292 --> 00:13:48.500 align:middle
experienced your Adolla Links
during the Great Fire.

00:13:48.583 --> 00:13:52.958 align:middle
A massive conflagration,
large-scale loss of human life.

00:13:53.042 --> 00:13:56.167 align:middle
Perhaps one of those
served as the catalyst.

00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:59.208 align:middle
Captain Huang, to springboard
off what you said

00:13:59.292 --> 00:14:01.375 align:middle
about his flame
not being unusual.

00:14:01.458 --> 00:14:02.792 align:middle
From firsthand experience,

00:14:02.875 --> 00:14:04.583 align:middle
is there something
tangibly different

00:14:04.667 --> 00:14:07.958 align:middle
about an Adolla Burst
that sets it apart?

00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:14.375 align:middle
[yells]

00:14:19.417 --> 00:14:20.625 align:middle
Is something wrong?

00:14:20.708 --> 00:14:21.750 align:middle
It's nothing.

00:14:21.833 --> 00:14:24.542 align:middle
Anyway, I'll need
to check with others

00:14:24.625 --> 00:14:26.500 align:middle
who have had an Adolla Link.

00:14:26.583 --> 00:14:30.458 align:middle
I know that Captain Hague
carries a stigma as well.

00:14:30.542 --> 00:14:33.167 align:middle
Meeting with him might
reveal something.

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:34.583 align:middle
I've got this "holy scar,"

00:14:34.667 --> 00:14:36.917 align:middle
and the White-Clad
came after me.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.458 align:middle
Are we sure Captain
Hague will be safe?

00:14:39.542 --> 00:14:40.917 align:middle
Let's hurry.

00:14:47.417 --> 00:14:48.958 align:middle
[HAGUE]
Oh!

00:14:49.042 --> 00:14:54.000 align:middle
Mmm, that's so good. So good!

00:14:54.083 --> 00:14:56.875 align:middle
You know exactly how
to do it. What a touch.

00:14:56.958 --> 00:15:00.250 align:middle
Who are you? One of the
White-Clad, I presume?

00:15:01.792 --> 00:15:06.292 align:middle
[GOLD] You who bear a stigma,
I have come for you.

00:15:08.083 --> 00:15:11.167 align:middle
You have a lovely golden arm.

00:15:17.042 --> 00:15:20.417 align:middle
But how are you behind me?

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:23.125 align:middle
[GOLD]
There is nothing behind you.

00:15:23.208 --> 00:15:24.667 align:middle
You should know,

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:28.875 align:middle
the Evangelist has more than
protectors at her disposal.

00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:33.917 align:middle
Who are you?
Or rather, what are you?

00:15:35.125 --> 00:15:37.167 align:middle
[GOLD]
A Destroyer.

00:15:41.417 --> 00:15:43.000 align:middle
[HAGUE]
A Fire Soldier's sacred duty

00:15:43.083 --> 00:15:47.250 align:middle
is to protect both human
lives and their property.

00:15:47.333 --> 00:15:49.833 align:middle
But never forget the life
you must value and protect

00:15:49.917 --> 00:15:51.917 align:middle
above all else is your own.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.625 align:middle
For when your life
has been snuffed out,

00:15:53.708 --> 00:15:58.125 align:middle
it's no longer possible
to save those of others.

[HAGUE, PAN]
<i>Látom.</i>

00:16:04.708 --> 00:16:08.208 align:middle
Losing a man is never easy.

00:16:08.292 --> 00:16:15.042 align:middle
Pan, always think rationally,
always act sensibly,

00:16:15.125 --> 00:16:19.250 align:middle
and always treat your own
life with the greatest care.

00:16:19.333 --> 00:16:22.292 align:middle
Fire Soldiers are
not mythical heroes.

00:16:22.375 --> 00:16:27.042 align:middle
We are human. Exactly like
the victims of those fires.

00:16:27.125 --> 00:16:29.417 align:middle
Mythical hero.
Wish you were one?

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:32.375 align:middle
Good question.

00:16:32.458 --> 00:16:34.042 align:middle
I think it would be
a wonderful thing

00:16:34.125 --> 00:16:37.792 align:middle
if such beings exist
beyond our understanding.

00:16:48.917 --> 00:16:50.125 align:middle
[whistle blows]

00:16:51.833 --> 00:16:53.500 align:middle
Help me get him down from there.

00:16:53.583 --> 00:16:55.125 align:middle
Yes, sir.

00:17:04.417 --> 00:17:07.208 align:middle
No signs of a
break-in or struggle.

00:17:07.292 --> 00:17:10.417 align:middle
Is it possible the captain
committed suicide?

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:12.208 align:middle
I don't believe so.

00:17:12.292 --> 00:17:16.208 align:middle
Although the great fire changed
the captain profoundly,

00:17:16.292 --> 00:17:20.542 align:middle
he'd never willingly throw
away his own life.

00:17:20.625 --> 00:17:21.750 align:middle
[KARIN]
So you're saying--

00:17:21.833 --> 00:17:23.667 align:middle
[PAN] I'm saying Captain
Hague was murdered,

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:27.167 align:middle
without any chance at
all of fighting back,

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:29.875 align:middle
by an extremely dangerous foe.

00:17:33.417 --> 00:17:36.208 align:middle
Never seen a flame
like this one.

00:17:36.292 --> 00:17:39.417 align:middle
So quiet and unbelievably hot.

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:42.000 align:middle
He's getting the
hang of it now.

00:17:51.125 --> 00:17:53.667 align:middle
[SHINRA]
Captain Hague?

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:55.542 align:middle
An Adolla Link?

00:18:04.542 --> 00:18:07.792 align:middle
I'm not done yet! I'm not
done yet! Not done yet!

00:18:07.875 --> 00:18:11.167 align:middle
Not yet! Not yet!
Not yet! Not yet!

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:13.875 align:middle
[SHINRA] So this is what
it's like to die.

I can't die yet! I'm not done!

00:18:28.625 --> 00:18:31.792 align:middle
Is that it, Captain
Shinmon? Did they just--?

00:18:31.875 --> 00:18:33.125 align:middle
They did.

00:18:33.208 --> 00:18:36.625 align:middle
They found the flame beyond
their furthest limits.

00:18:36.708 --> 00:18:38.542 align:middle
They're doin' it, huh?

00:18:38.625 --> 00:18:41.583 align:middle
All right, that's enough, guys.

00:18:41.667 --> 00:18:43.417 align:middle
Very good work.

00:18:48.958 --> 00:18:51.708 align:middle
Now you need to be able
to call that up at any time.

00:18:51.792 --> 00:18:56.083 align:middle
What the hell?
What did I just do?

00:18:56.167 --> 00:18:57.458 align:middle
Looks like the
training is running

00:18:57.542 --> 00:18:58.958 align:middle
right on schedule for day one.

00:18:59.042 --> 00:19:02.625 align:middle
Huh? What's wrong, Shinra?

00:19:02.708 --> 00:19:05.667 align:middle
[SHINRA]
That was the "Press of Death."

00:19:11.208 --> 00:19:14.250 align:middle
Is Captain Hague really dead?

00:19:18.375 --> 00:19:20.708 align:middle
[whistle blows]

00:19:31.708 --> 00:19:34.417 align:middle
[SHINRA] Due to Captain Hague's
history of masochism,

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:36.417 align:middle
his death was determined
to be the result

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:38.833 align:middle
of self-inflicted wounds.

00:19:38.917 --> 00:19:41.875 align:middle
But the scene was so gruesome,

00:19:41.958 --> 00:19:45.708 align:middle
and his body was pierced head
to toe with all those stakes.

00:19:45.792 --> 00:19:48.792 align:middle
The suicide ruling
makes zero sense.

00:19:51.667 --> 00:19:53.417 align:middle
All right, then.

00:19:54.583 --> 00:19:55.333 align:middle

Those White-Clad bastards are
gonna come around here again.

00:20:02.875 --> 00:20:06.917 align:middle
Konro, don't go off on your
own without telling me.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.542 align:middle
Shinra and the others

00:20:09.625 --> 00:20:12.250 align:middle
it's time for the Empire

You have a stigma as

so please be careful.

Perhaps you should take
on a security detail.

00:20:51.375 --> 00:20:53.375 align:middle
[BURNS] What we face is
a trial presented to us

One for all devotees of the
Holy Sol Temple to follow.

00:21:03.167 --> 00:21:05.167 align:middle
Through our conduct
and discipline,

00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:07.542 align:middle
we must demonstrate that
we will never back down

00:21:07.625 --> 00:21:11.333 align:middle
from such cowardly
acts of terrorism.

00:21:11.417 --> 00:21:14.292 align:middle

To dispel the darkness.

Now, let us go forth and
take back this Empire.

[SHINRA]
Incredible.

00:22:16.417 --> 00:22:19.167 align:middle
When we started, the 8th was
fighting our battles alone.

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:20.500 align:middle
But we kept going and gained

all these wonderful
allies along the way.

00:22:48.958 --> 00:22:52.542 align:middle
Our enemy is powerful,
and still a mystery.
