about your opponents' lives.

but the blades move
so haphazardly,

00:17:09.904 --> 00:17:11.614 position:50% align:center
they're messing with
the air currents,

00:17:11.698 --> 00:17:15.368 position:50% align:center

where the fire will go next.

you use up all the cards.

That's how I play.

back out of the game now?

Hm?

00:17:59.496 --> 00:18:02.499 position:50% align:center
You should know this
isn't a silly game.

I didn't come all the way
down here to mess around.

to one day rip off the

[JOKER]
Five and two.

00:18:34.698 --> 00:18:36.991 position:50% align:center
Using this deck of 52 cards,

00:18:37.075 --> 00:18:39.953 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna put an end
to your miserable life.

00:18:42.497 --> 00:18:44.374 position:50% align:center
So why don't you just
keep on counting

00:18:44.457 --> 00:18:46.668 position:50% align:center
until your life is over?

00:18:47.711 --> 00:18:50.130 position:50% align:center
How many left now?

00:18:57.053 --> 00:18:58.304 position:50% align:center
Those of us in the collective

00:18:58.388 --> 00:19:01.474 position:50% align:center
have the strength of
unity on our side.

00:19:01.558 --> 00:19:02.892 position:50% align:center
Though we may split up,

00:19:02.976 --> 00:19:06.312 position:50% align:center
we will always return to
become a single unit again.

00:19:06.396 --> 00:19:09.899 position:50% align:center
The individual simply falls
wherever he may stand.

00:19:09.983 --> 00:19:13.486 position:50% align:center
So you should be the
one counting, Five-two.

00:19:14.487 --> 00:19:18.491 position:50% align:center
How many cards do you have left
before your life is forfeit?

00:19:21.119 --> 00:19:24.539 position:50% align:center
Seems you've lost the majority
of your cards, Five-two.

00:19:24.622 --> 00:19:26.041 position:50% align:center
In fact, it appears
you only have

00:19:26.124 --> 00:19:29.127 position:50% align:center
a handful of them remaining.

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:31.921 position:50% align:center
You deluded yourself by
thinking you left the group.

00:19:32.005 --> 00:19:34.299 position:50% align:center
You wanted some kind of freedom.

00:19:34.382 --> 00:19:35.967 position:50% align:center
The truth is,
you're just a weakling

00:19:36.051 --> 00:19:39.137 position:50% align:center
who couldn't handle
living in our collective.

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:42.223 position:50% align:center
I knew way back then
you'd always be a loser.

00:19:42.307 --> 00:19:45.143 position:50% align:center
And a sorry mutt like you
who abandons the collective

00:19:45.226 --> 00:19:47.520 position:50% align:center
can never be a winner.

00:19:49.981 --> 00:19:53.026 position:50% align:center
You haven't forgotten I'm the
one who trained you, have you?

00:19:53.109 --> 00:19:56.654 position:50% align:center
I know all the tricks
up your sleeve.

00:19:56.738 --> 00:19:59.199 position:50% align:center
How many cards
does that leave you?

00:19:59.282 --> 00:20:00.992 position:50% align:center

Just two of 'em.

done, so are you.

How does it feel to know
that certain death

00:20:06.039 --> 00:20:08.667 position:50% align:center

the final card in your hand,
