[footsteps]

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:38.038 position:50% align:center
No surprise.

00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:40.457 position:50% align:center
If I wanna get my hands
on those scriptures,

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.085 position:50% align:center
I guess I'm gonna have to go
though you first, aren't I?

00:00:44.169 --> 00:00:47.339 position:50% align:center
You've kept quiet and out of
the spotlight for a long time,

00:00:47.422 --> 00:00:50.842 position:50% align:center
but it appears you've decided
to make a bold entrance.

00:00:50.925 --> 00:00:53.720 position:50% align:center
I couldn't stand having the
truth being hidden any longer,

00:00:53.803 --> 00:00:55.597 position:50% align:center
so here we are.

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:01.353 position:50% align:center
[BURNS]
Come on.

00:02:39.576 --> 00:02:42.996 position:50% align:center
If you're doing this,
I want a piece of the fight.

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.248 position:50% align:center
Sounds like a good time.

00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:47.500 position:50% align:center
[BURNS]
Captain Shinmon.

00:02:49.085 --> 00:02:52.881 position:50% align:center
There a problem?
Or just gettin' cold feet?

00:02:52.964 --> 00:02:55.717 position:50% align:center
[BURNS sighs]

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.386 position:50% align:center
This is no time for
us to be fighting.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.846 position:50% align:center
I'd like to hear what
you have to say.

00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:00.972 position:50% align:center
What?!

00:03:01.056 --> 00:03:02.807 position:50% align:center
So you realized I had
the toughest guy

00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:04.934 position:50% align:center
on the force with me
and folded, huh?

00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:06.644 position:50% align:center
I thought that of
all the captains,

00:03:06.728 --> 00:03:08.521 position:50% align:center
you'd be the one to
actually prove to be

00:03:08.605 --> 00:03:10.774 position:50% align:center
a bit of a challenge for me.

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:14.027 position:50% align:center
Though I hear they keep
the biggest fish at Haijima.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.072 position:50% align:center
[JOKER] If you're not gonna
fight, then why are you here?

00:03:19.741 --> 00:03:22.994 position:50% align:center
You're looking to uncover
secrets of the Holy Sol Temple,

00:03:23.078 --> 00:03:25.747 position:50% align:center
so I thought I would provide
you with some leads.

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.332 position:50% align:center
[JOKER]
Oh, yeah?

00:03:27.415 --> 00:03:29.501 position:50% align:center
I'm completely lost right now.

00:03:29.584 --> 00:03:32.796 position:50% align:center
Why is the captain of
the 1st here, anyway?

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.882 position:50% align:center
And how do the two of you
even know each other?

00:03:35.965 --> 00:03:37.676 position:50% align:center
[JOKER] You could say
Burns was a liaison

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:41.554 position:50% align:center
between the Holy Sol Temple's
face and its underbelly.

00:03:41.638 --> 00:03:45.725 position:50% align:center
And he used to look after me
when I was down here.

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:49.396 position:50% align:center
At least, till we had our
Adolla Link, that is.

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:51.147 position:50% align:center
D'ya say "Adolla Link"?

00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:54.275 position:50% align:center
Shinra from the 8th talked
about the same thing.

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:55.777 position:50% align:center
It happened to us

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.738 position:50% align:center
when there was a major outbreak
of Infernals at Amaterasu.

00:03:58.822 --> 00:04:00.782 position:50% align:center
That seems like a big deal.

00:04:00.865 --> 00:04:03.743 position:50% align:center
I've never heard of anything
like that happening there.

00:04:03.827 --> 00:04:06.246 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it is a big deal.

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:09.749 position:50% align:center
Which is precisely the reason
why you've never heard of it.

00:04:09.833 --> 00:04:13.003 position:50% align:center
We have to believe
that Amaterasu's safe.

00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:15.755 position:50% align:center
So to keep the general
public in the dark,

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:18.174 position:50% align:center
they called in the Shadows.

00:04:20.427 --> 00:04:22.053 position:50% align:center
Only one left.

00:04:22.137 --> 00:04:25.598 position:50% align:center
The other Shadows should've
finished off the rest of them.

00:04:25.682 --> 00:04:28.018 position:50% align:center
[BURNS]
The target's nearby.

00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:29.728 position:50% align:center
[JOKER]
Here it comes.

00:04:32.313 --> 00:04:34.566 position:50% align:center
I'll handle it.

00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:36.276 position:50% align:center
[BURNS]
Wait, something feels off.

00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:37.402 position:50% align:center
I got it!

00:04:37.485 --> 00:04:39.362 position:50% align:center
[wails]

00:04:39.446 --> 00:04:44.951 position:50% align:center
[BOTH grunting]

00:04:45.035 --> 00:04:51.041 position:50% align:center
[JOKER screams]

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.174 position:50% align:center
[JOKER] Hey, Burns, what's it
like in the outside world?

00:04:59.257 --> 00:05:01.718 position:50% align:center
Human combustion is
still going on, right?

00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:03.094 position:50% align:center
Sadly, yes.

00:05:03.178 --> 00:05:05.930 position:50% align:center
Infernal outbreaks are
continuing to happen.

00:05:06.014 --> 00:05:07.766 position:50% align:center
So not only does it
suck in the Nether,

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:09.893 position:50% align:center
things are bad on the surface.

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:14.272 position:50% align:center
Our world is rife with suffering
and cries for Sol's salvation.

00:05:14.356 --> 00:05:17.776 position:50% align:center
You really believe that praying
to God will fix everything?

00:05:17.859 --> 00:05:18.985 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:21.154 position:50% align:center
Not me.

00:05:21.237 --> 00:05:25.116 position:50% align:center
I don't wanna rely on anything
or to beg for salvation.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.619 position:50% align:center
I want something that's
way more clear.

00:05:27.702 --> 00:05:29.996 position:50% align:center
So much evil in this world.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.249 position:50% align:center
Religion. Government.

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:35.460 position:50% align:center
All of those who manipulate
people's goodwill

00:05:35.543 --> 00:05:40.674 position:50% align:center
for their own advantage make
the world an even worse place.

00:05:40.757 --> 00:05:43.009 position:50% align:center
I wanna know why it
has to be like this.

00:05:43.093 --> 00:05:47.263 position:50% align:center
Why does the world suck so much?
I wanna know the truth!

00:05:53.812 --> 00:05:56.648 position:50% align:center
[BURNS groans]

00:06:01.986 --> 00:06:03.697 position:50% align:center
[BURNS]
A higher dimension.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:04.572 position:50% align:center
[JOKER]
The world.

00:06:04.656 --> 00:06:05.865 position:50% align:center
[BURNS]
Truth.

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:10.412 position:50% align:center
--[JOKER] Law. Mathematics.
--[BURNS] Insects.

00:06:10.495 --> 00:06:12.122 position:50% align:center
[JOKER]
Hell.

00:06:13.623 --> 00:06:14.958 position:50% align:center
God.

[screaming]

00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:22.882 position:50% align:center
Hey, Five-two!

00:06:22.966 --> 00:06:25.093 position:50% align:center
My eye!

00:06:26.094 --> 00:06:27.887 position:50% align:center
[BURNS yells]

00:06:29.973 --> 00:06:32.183 position:50% align:center
[BURNS]
Five-two! Are you okay?

00:06:36.104 --> 00:06:41.317 position:50% align:center
Was that a dream...
or a hallucination?

00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:43.069 position:50% align:center
What did we see?

00:06:43.153 --> 00:06:46.698 position:50% align:center
It's real. It wasn't a dream.

00:06:46.781 --> 00:06:50.410 position:50% align:center
We were both just pulled into
a completely different realm.

00:06:51.995 --> 00:06:53.496 position:50% align:center
[JOKER]
Look at this.

00:06:54.664 --> 00:06:57.667 position:50% align:center
The world we saw...

00:06:57.751 --> 00:07:00.045 position:50% align:center
...it really exists!

00:07:06.301 --> 00:07:08.053 position:50% align:center
[JOKER]
You still have the stone?

00:07:08.136 --> 00:07:11.056 position:50% align:center
The one that you brought
back from Adolla?

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:15.352 position:50% align:center
I've kept it sealed in a jar.
It burns to this very day.

00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:18.897 position:50% align:center
Both of us saw a being
from a higher dimension.

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.023 position:50% align:center
And we know the Temple

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:22.776 position:50% align:center
is hiding something
big from everyone.

00:07:24.527 --> 00:07:27.614 position:50% align:center
You're searching for the truth
and I've got clues for you.

00:07:27.697 --> 00:07:29.866 position:50% align:center
They're in here.

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:32.494 position:50% align:center
Look through this.

00:07:32.577 --> 00:07:33.745 position:50% align:center
[JOKER]
What is it?

00:07:33.828 --> 00:07:35.914 position:50% align:center
[BURNS] The diary of the
wife of Raffles the 1st,

00:07:35.997 --> 00:07:38.249 position:50% align:center
founder of the Holy Sol Temple.

00:07:38.333 --> 00:07:40.669 position:50% align:center
Her diary?

00:07:40.752 --> 00:07:43.797 position:50% align:center
I put myself through this crap
to find hidden scriptures.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.132 position:50% align:center
Those simply do not exist.

00:07:46.216 --> 00:07:49.177 position:50% align:center
And how can you be
so sure about that?

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.179 position:50% align:center
Because just like you,

00:07:51.262 --> 00:07:55.475 position:50% align:center
I've been looking into the Holy
Sol Temple for a long time.

00:07:55.558 --> 00:07:58.770 position:50% align:center
Since the day of
our Adolla Link.

00:07:58.853 --> 00:08:03.149 position:50% align:center
What we saw made me question
everything I thought I knew.

00:08:03.233 --> 00:08:05.318 position:50% align:center
Shattered my preconceptions.

00:08:05.402 --> 00:08:08.279 position:50% align:center
And I began searching
for the truth as well.

00:08:09.948 --> 00:08:12.784 position:50% align:center
[BURNS] As a result
of my investigations,

00:08:12.867 --> 00:08:16.037 position:50% align:center
I discovered this book.

00:08:16.121 --> 00:08:18.415 position:50% align:center
I leveraged my position
as captain of the 1st

00:08:18.498 --> 00:08:22.043 position:50% align:center
to get my hands on any
information I could.

00:08:22.127 --> 00:08:23.628 position:50% align:center
But I found nothing
in the church

00:08:23.712 --> 00:08:27.882 position:50% align:center
that provided any new insight
into the Holy Sol Temple's past.

00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:34.055 position:50% align:center
[BURNS] However, one day,
while exploring various ruins

00:08:34.139 --> 00:08:35.974 position:50% align:center
and parts of the
forgotten nether,

00:08:36.057 --> 00:08:38.768 position:50% align:center
I happened to stumble
upon the diary.

00:08:40.478 --> 00:08:42.230 position:50% align:center
And you're telling me
it really belonged

00:08:42.313 --> 00:08:45.025 position:50% align:center
to the wife of Raffles the 1st?

00:08:45.108 --> 00:08:47.152 position:50% align:center
Yes, I believe it does.

00:08:47.235 --> 00:08:49.571 position:50% align:center
It chronicles the time from
the Day of the Cataclysm

00:08:49.654 --> 00:08:52.782 position:50% align:center
till the founding of
the Temple and Empire.

00:08:52.866 --> 00:08:54.034 position:50% align:center
There is quite a
bit of information

00:08:54.117 --> 00:08:56.995 position:50% align:center
on the founder, Raffles the 1st.

00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:00.707 position:50% align:center
[JOKER]
Huh.

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:03.668 position:50% align:center
[BURNS] Her account of the
founding of the Tokyo Empire

00:09:03.752 --> 00:09:06.421 position:50% align:center
is the same one that we
citizens have all been told

00:09:06.504 --> 00:09:09.966 position:50% align:center
and is just as it appears
in the scriptures.

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:12.552 position:50% align:center
A caravan led by
Raffles the 1st

00:09:12.635 --> 00:09:15.722 position:50% align:center
discovered an Adolla Burst
at the end of a long journey

00:09:15.805 --> 00:09:17.891 position:50% align:center
and built Amaterasu,

00:09:17.974 --> 00:09:21.061 position:50% align:center
which would become the
cornerstone of the Empire.

00:09:21.144 --> 00:09:23.104 position:50% align:center
Basically what
you're telling us

00:09:23.188 --> 00:09:26.900 position:50% align:center
is the Holy Sol Temple isn't
hiding anything at all.

00:09:26.983 --> 00:09:28.985 position:50% align:center
That's hard to believe.

00:09:29.069 --> 00:09:31.404 position:50% align:center
[BURNS] You shouldn't focus
on the lager picture.

00:09:31.488 --> 00:09:35.742 position:50% align:center
But rather, the way Raffles was
behaving according to his wife.

00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:38.787 position:50% align:center
"The caravan that had been
making the journey with Raffles

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:42.582 position:50% align:center
had been completely wiped out
somewhere along the way.

00:09:42.665 --> 00:09:45.126 position:50% align:center
Of course, I was relieved
that my beloved husband

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:47.629 position:50% align:center
had managed to come
back home safely.

00:09:47.712 --> 00:09:51.883 position:50% align:center
However, since his return, he's
been acting quite strangely.

00:09:51.966 --> 00:09:56.596 position:50% align:center
Like he's become a completely
different person altogether."

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.515 position:50% align:center
[BURNS] "Though his
appearance is unchanged,

00:09:58.598 --> 00:10:00.266 position:50% align:center
his mannerisms
and idiosyncrasies

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:02.977 position:50% align:center
are that of another man.

00:10:03.061 --> 00:10:04.813 position:50% align:center
I cannot believe
he is the person

00:10:04.896 --> 00:10:07.482 position:50% align:center
to whom I've been
married for 30 years.

00:10:07.565 --> 00:10:10.068 position:50% align:center
The only answer is, he's not."

00:10:10.151 --> 00:10:12.445 position:50% align:center
Even if you assume that
the experience he went through

00:10:12.529 --> 00:10:14.489 position:50% align:center
on the journey was traumatic,

00:10:14.572 --> 00:10:16.783 position:50% align:center
would it be enough to alter
something so unique

00:10:16.866 --> 00:10:18.493 position:50% align:center
as his mannerisms?

00:10:18.576 --> 00:10:23.248 position:50% align:center
You know, I feel like I've
heard all of this before.

00:10:23.331 --> 00:10:25.542 position:50% align:center
In Asakusa, there was
someone who had the ability

00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:28.294 position:50% align:center
to turn himself and others
into different people.

00:10:28.378 --> 00:10:31.631 position:50% align:center
That whole thing went down
pretty recently, though.

00:10:31.715 --> 00:10:35.552 position:50% align:center
This Raffles stuff
was 250 years ago.

00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:37.637 position:50% align:center
Infernals don't die like us.

00:10:37.721 --> 00:10:40.724 position:50% align:center
It's quite possible
that this being

00:10:40.807 --> 00:10:42.892 position:50% align:center
is an inhuman from
another dimension,

00:10:42.976 --> 00:10:45.311 position:50% align:center
much like the Evangelist.

00:10:48.565 --> 00:10:50.692 position:50% align:center
[BURNS] If that's true,
then the Holy Sol Temple

00:10:50.775 --> 00:10:53.945 position:50% align:center
may be a religion that was
set up by such a creature.

00:10:54.029 --> 00:10:56.573 position:50% align:center
One who had taken
Raffles' place.

00:10:56.656 --> 00:10:58.450 position:50% align:center
Which is an even more
compelling reason

00:10:58.533 --> 00:11:01.286 position:50% align:center
why we should burn this whole
damn religion to the ground.

00:11:01.369 --> 00:11:02.662 position:50% align:center
But wait a second.

00:11:02.746 --> 00:11:06.166 position:50% align:center
Are you positive that we
can even trust this book?

00:11:06.249 --> 00:11:08.376 position:50% align:center
Whatever its origin,
the fact is,

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:12.672 position:50% align:center
the Holy Sol Temple now
offers solace to the people.

00:11:12.756 --> 00:11:15.050 position:50% align:center
Bringing it down
would cause chaos.

00:11:15.133 --> 00:11:18.178 position:50% align:center
[JOKER] So first, the caravan
is completely wiped out,

00:11:18.261 --> 00:11:21.514 position:50% align:center
then ol' Raffles
comes back changed.

00:11:21.598 --> 00:11:23.058 position:50% align:center
I mean, that's all
just according

00:11:23.141 --> 00:11:27.854 position:50% align:center
to this one lady's diary,
which you believe to be true.

00:11:27.937 --> 00:11:29.564 position:50% align:center
But these days,
do the higher-ups

00:11:29.647 --> 00:11:32.233 position:50% align:center
in the Holy Sol Temple
know about this?

00:11:32.317 --> 00:11:33.818 position:50% align:center
Not sure.

00:11:33.902 --> 00:11:37.739 position:50% align:center
It's quite possible that Raffles
the 3rd himself doesn't know.

00:11:37.822 --> 00:11:39.657 position:50% align:center
I'd imagine that no
one knows the truth

00:11:39.741 --> 00:11:43.453 position:50% align:center
about what happened
250 years ago.

00:11:43.536 --> 00:11:44.704 position:50% align:center
[JOKER]
Which means we could search

00:11:44.788 --> 00:11:47.415 position:50% align:center
every nook and cranny
of the Holy Sol Temple

00:11:47.499 --> 00:11:51.378 position:50% align:center
and not find a single thing
connecting it to the Evangelist.

00:11:53.213 --> 00:11:54.089 position:50% align:center
[INCA]
Huh?!

00:11:54.172 --> 00:11:55.757 position:50% align:center
Yona?

00:11:59.094 --> 00:12:01.513 position:50% align:center
You actually turned yourself
into Raffles the 1st

00:12:01.596 --> 00:12:04.599 position:50% align:center
and founded the Holy Sol Temple?

00:12:04.683 --> 00:12:06.101 position:50% align:center
Indeed.

00:12:06.184 --> 00:12:10.230 position:50% align:center
The Raffles you read about
in the holy scriptures was me.

00:12:10.313 --> 00:12:12.607 position:50% align:center
The Holy Sol Temple
is a religion I started

00:12:12.691 --> 00:12:14.567 position:50% align:center
under orders from
the Evangelist

00:12:14.651 --> 00:12:17.487 position:50% align:center
to exploit human will
to our advantage

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:20.281 position:50% align:center
and lead them to Adolla.

00:12:20.365 --> 00:12:24.285 position:50% align:center
Everything was guided by
the hand of the Evangelist.

00:12:25.286 --> 00:12:28.456 position:50% align:center
I can sweep today's little
incident under the rug.

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:30.125 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:12:30.208 --> 00:12:33.628 position:50% align:center
I've heard stories about
the 7th's Captain Shinmon,

00:12:33.712 --> 00:12:35.797 position:50% align:center
but you're more of a
tough guy than they say.

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:39.259 position:50% align:center
I'm not so sure what
exactly you mean by that,

00:12:39.342 --> 00:12:41.594 position:50% align:center
but that's a compliment
where I'm from.

00:12:41.678 --> 00:12:43.763 position:50% align:center
Luckily, you pulled your
punches to some degree,

00:12:43.847 --> 00:12:46.057 position:50% align:center
so there's just minimal damage.

00:12:46.141 --> 00:12:49.769 position:50% align:center
Plus the fact that this group
has been hidden in the shadows.

00:12:49.853 --> 00:12:51.896 position:50% align:center
And only one fatality.

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:54.149 position:50% align:center
I can keep this under wraps.

00:12:56.276 --> 00:12:59.571 position:50% align:center
Tell me, what's your next move?

00:12:59.654 --> 00:13:03.450 position:50% align:center
The truth, much like the eye
you lost, remains in the dark.

00:13:03.533 --> 00:13:08.204 position:50% align:center
Well, it's a good thing I can
see the truth with only one eye.

00:13:08.288 --> 00:13:10.957 position:50% align:center
Let's go, Mr. Almighty.

00:13:11.041 --> 00:13:15.128 position:50% align:center
There are still a whole lot of
things I want to investigate.

00:13:15.211 --> 00:13:19.299 position:50% align:center
Sounds to me like you know where
you'll train that eye next.

00:13:19.382 --> 00:13:22.218 position:50% align:center
Next? Yeah.

00:13:22.302 --> 00:13:24.679 position:50% align:center
Haijima Industries.

00:13:25.805 --> 00:13:27.390 position:50% align:center
Since they worked hand in hand

00:13:27.474 --> 00:13:30.185 position:50% align:center
with the Holy Sol Temple
to build Amaterasu,

00:13:30.268 --> 00:13:33.480 position:50% align:center
I've got a hunch they're
the link to the Evangelist.

00:13:33.563 --> 00:13:37.108 position:50% align:center
You might find clues to Raffles
the 1st's true identity.

00:13:37.192 --> 00:13:40.612 position:50% align:center
But still, Haijima's
a big company.

00:13:40.695 --> 00:13:44.532 position:50% align:center
They have facilities spread out
all over the Tokyo Empire.

00:13:44.616 --> 00:13:47.535 position:50% align:center
How would you know
where to look first?

00:13:47.619 --> 00:13:50.997 position:50% align:center
I guess I'll just have to
hit 'em up one at a time.

00:13:51.081 --> 00:13:52.415 position:50% align:center
Haijima, huh?

00:13:52.499 --> 00:13:55.251 position:50% align:center
They make the medicine that
Lieutenant Konro needs.

00:13:55.335 --> 00:13:57.504 position:50% align:center
I can't cause trouble there.

00:13:58.463 --> 00:13:59.798 position:50% align:center
You, uh, you didn't think that

00:13:59.881 --> 00:14:03.218 position:50% align:center
because of the ties between
them and the Temple,

00:14:03.301 --> 00:14:06.680 position:50% align:center
today's excursion might make
them cut off his supply?

00:14:06.763 --> 00:14:08.848 position:50% align:center
Never crossed my mind.

00:14:08.932 --> 00:14:12.644 position:50% align:center
Don't you worry. I'll take
care of that, as well.

00:14:12.727 --> 00:14:15.772 position:50% align:center
But I want you to check
out Haijima, in return.

00:14:15.855 --> 00:14:18.358 position:50% align:center
My position does constrain me.

00:14:18.441 --> 00:14:21.736 position:50% align:center
At least regarding any
action against Haijima.

he mean by "try it out"?

00:18:09.839 --> 00:18:11.383 position:50% align:center
And the Temple leaders,

00:18:11.466 --> 00:18:14.010 position:50% align:center
even they don't know
anything about it?

00:18:14.094 --> 00:18:16.054 position:50% align:center
Since that's the case,
there's no reason

00:18:16.137 --> 00:18:18.848 position:50% align:center
to delve further
into the Temple, huh?

00:18:18.932 --> 00:18:22.060 position:50% align:center
Now we're not a hundred percent
on the veracity of this intel,

00:18:22.143 --> 00:18:23.770 position:50% align:center
but it's likely to be true.

00:18:23.853 --> 00:18:25.730 position:50% align:center
[LISA]
'Scuse me. If I may.

00:18:25.814 --> 00:18:27.148 position:50% align:center
Yes?

00:18:27.232 --> 00:18:30.777 position:50% align:center
You may not believe me,
but in my own experience,

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:33.154 position:50% align:center
I didn't ever see any
kind of connection

00:18:33.238 --> 00:18:35.532 position:50% align:center
between the Evangelist
and the Temple.

00:18:35.615 --> 00:18:36.700 position:50% align:center
Also--

00:18:41.705 --> 00:18:45.000 position:50% align:center
Thank you for tellin' us.
But don't push yourself.

00:18:45.083 --> 00:18:46.876 position:50% align:center
Let's go take a little break.

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.545 position:50% align:center
[LISA]
Uh-huh.

00:18:51.381 --> 00:18:53.591 position:50% align:center
'Scuse us. She needs rest.

00:18:53.675 --> 00:18:54.884 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Sure.

00:18:56.803 --> 00:18:59.681 position:50% align:center
Dr. Giovanni has a long
history with Haijima,

00:18:59.764 --> 00:19:02.183 position:50% align:center
so connection there wouldn't
surprise me in the least.

00:19:02.267 --> 00:19:05.770 position:50% align:center
That's true. But investigating
Haijima will be tough.

00:19:05.854 --> 00:19:06.354 position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:19:06.438 --> 00:19:07.605 position:50% align:center
What do ya mean?

00:19:07.689 --> 00:19:09.733 position:50% align:center
We just gotta charge
in there like Benimaru

00:19:09.816 --> 00:19:10.859 position:50% align:center
and bust some heads.

00:19:10.942 --> 00:19:12.068 position:50% align:center
That's crazy!

00:19:12.152 --> 00:19:14.237 position:50% align:center
Just where the hell are
you gonna charge into?

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.113 position:50% align:center
Man, you're dumb!

00:19:15.196 --> 00:19:16.740 position:50% align:center
Have you even been listening?

00:19:16.823 --> 00:19:19.993 position:50% align:center
We can charge right through
Haijima's front door, stupid!

00:19:20.076 --> 00:19:23.163 position:50% align:center
Fact is, Haijima's
a huge conglomerate,

00:19:23.246 --> 00:19:24.956 position:50% align:center
and they've got their
claws in just about

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:27.292 position:50% align:center
every industry in
the Tokyo Empire.

00:19:27.375 --> 00:19:29.544 position:50% align:center
When you add in all
the subsidiaries,

00:19:29.627 --> 00:19:31.504 position:50% align:center
it's basically taking
up countless roles

00:19:31.588 --> 00:19:35.675 position:50% align:center
in the supply chain in about
every kind of business there is.

00:19:35.759 --> 00:19:37.385 position:50% align:center
Take clothing, for example.

00:19:37.469 --> 00:19:40.680 position:50% align:center
Haijima has a key role
in materials, design,

00:19:40.764 --> 00:19:42.098 position:50% align:center
and production.

00:19:42.182 --> 00:19:44.517 position:50% align:center
Food? They source
the raw materials,

00:19:44.601 --> 00:19:46.686 position:50% align:center
they make the cookware
and kitchen supplies,

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:49.022 position:50% align:center
and even build stores
and restaurants.

00:19:49.105 --> 00:19:50.815 position:50% align:center
When you look at
the bigger picture,

00:19:50.899 --> 00:19:53.818 position:50% align:center
roughly 70% of the
Empire's population

00:19:53.902 --> 00:19:56.112 position:50% align:center
works at a Haijima-
related company.

00:19:56.196 --> 00:19:57.238 position:50% align:center
Whoa.

00:19:57.322 --> 00:19:59.157 position:50% align:center
Even the Special Fire
Force is a part.

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:01.826 position:50% align:center
Haijima has a great deal
of influence over us.

00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:03.912 position:50% align:center
Does that make me a suspect?

00:20:03.995 --> 00:20:06.498 position:50% align:center
And since it's everywhere,
it's practically impossible

00:20:06.581 --> 00:20:08.667 position:50% align:center
to get the full scope
of the company.

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:11.378 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't even know
where we would begin.

00:20:11.461 --> 00:20:12.962 position:50% align:center
Do we know someone
who has insight

00:20:13.046 --> 00:20:15.715 position:50% align:center
into their inner workings?

00:20:15.799 --> 00:20:18.677 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Inspector Licht!

00:20:20.053 --> 00:20:21.513 position:50% align:center
He would know.

00:20:21.596 --> 00:20:24.057 position:50% align:center
But he's not here.
Where is he?

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:26.351 position:50% align:center
Coincidentally, he's
meeting with Haijima

00:20:26.434 --> 00:20:29.604 position:50% align:center
concerning his report on
the Chinese Peninsula.

00:20:30.689 --> 00:20:32.148 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:20:39.364 --> 00:20:43.702 position:50% align:center
Uh. Look. It's Captain Hibana.
Top of the morning.

00:20:43.785 --> 00:20:46.371 position:50% align:center
Your report, I read it.

00:20:46.454 --> 00:20:50.125 position:50% align:center
Amaterasu's energy source and
Haijima's abilities program

00:20:50.208 --> 00:20:53.336 position:50% align:center
didn't really need
to be included.

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:55.338 position:50% align:center
That's actually the
reason why the president

00:20:55.422 --> 00:20:57.048 position:50% align:center
called me in today.

00:20:57.132 --> 00:21:00.427 position:50% align:center
He moves around so much
I gotta say I'm flattered.

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:04.180 position:50% align:center
Careful. They'll wipe you out.

00:21:04.264 --> 00:21:06.641 position:50% align:center
I thought you were
Haijima's faithful lapdog,

00:21:06.725 --> 00:21:09.811 position:50% align:center
but you've bit
your master's hand.

00:21:09.894 --> 00:21:11.855 position:50% align:center
What are you after?

00:21:22.407 --> 00:21:25.410 position:50% align:center
We need to talk
about your report.

00:21:25.493 --> 00:21:27.245 position:50% align:center
Your job is to be our mole

00:21:27.328 --> 00:21:30.832 position:50% align:center
inside Special Fire Force
Company 8, is it not?

00:21:33.168 --> 00:21:36.713 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir, and to keep an
eye on Shinra Kusakabe.

00:21:36.796 --> 00:21:39.341 position:50% align:center
This generator on
the Chinese Peninsula,

00:21:39.424 --> 00:21:43.094 position:50% align:center
even if it does somehow run off
a person with an Adolla Burst,

00:21:43.178 --> 00:21:46.639 position:50% align:center
you can't assert that the
Empire's Amaterasu is the same.

00:21:46.723 --> 00:21:49.851 position:50% align:center
What's more, it's irresponsible
to claim that this fuel source

00:21:49.934 --> 00:21:51.603 position:50% align:center
is linked to Haijima's
charitable work

00:21:51.686 --> 00:21:53.063 position:50% align:center
with pyrokinetic orphans.

00:21:53.146 --> 00:21:55.315 position:50% align:center
They're not!

00:21:55.398 --> 00:21:57.150 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
It's all right.

00:21:57.233 --> 00:22:02.197 position:50% align:center
The real reason I asked you here
today is to do a job for us.

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:06.785 position:50% align:center
We need you to bring Shinra
Kusakabe to our laboratory.

00:22:09.579 --> 00:22:12.082 position:50% align:center
Please excuse me, gentlemen.

00:22:16.336 --> 00:22:19.005 position:50% align:center
[EXECUTIVE A] That man is far
too curious for his own good.

00:22:19.089 --> 00:22:20.965 position:50% align:center
We should take him
out of the picture.

00:22:21.049 --> 00:22:22.967 position:50% align:center
[EXECUTIVE B]
Fortunately, he's unpowered.

00:22:23.051 --> 00:22:26.096 position:50% align:center
We can say he's just another
victim of human combustion.

00:22:26.179 --> 00:22:29.724 position:50% align:center
If we do it on the premises,
it'll be quite easy to cover up.

00:22:29.808 --> 00:22:32.477 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
Yes. I agree.

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:34.896 position:50% align:center
He'll deliver Kusakabe,

00:22:34.979 --> 00:22:38.316 position:50% align:center
but as soon as we are able
to split the two of them up,

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:40.610 position:50% align:center
then we'll kill him.

00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:20.752 position:50% align:center
[IRIS]
The 8th begins investigating

00:24:20.835 --> 00:24:23.546 position:50% align:center
Haijima Industries,
but the suspicious facility

00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:25.465 position:50% align:center
that Shinra and Licht
are called into

00:24:25.548 --> 00:24:27.967 position:50% align:center
houses an extremely
dangerous man.

00:24:28.051 --> 00:24:30.845 position:50% align:center
Wait, Shinra, do you
actually know him?

00:24:30.929 --> 00:24:34.474 position:50% align:center
[KURONO] Punishing the weak
is my favorite thing to do.
