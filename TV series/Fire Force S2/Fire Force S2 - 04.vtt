Maki, now there's a demon.
We're in a bind here.

00:11:27.187 --> 00:11:28.313 position:50% align:center
[MAKI]
Copy!

00:11:28.396 --> 00:11:30.940 position:50% align:center
The Sister is on her way!
Just hold tight!

00:11:31.024 --> 00:11:33.526 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
Tch. Easy for her to say.

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:38.531 position:50% align:center
What're we supposed to do
with just the two of us?

00:11:38.615 --> 00:11:39.908 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:11:39.991 --> 00:11:41.868 position:50% align:center
I got here as fast as I could!

00:11:41.951 --> 00:11:44.871 position:50% align:center
It was kinda tough to
get changed so quickly!

00:11:44.954 --> 00:11:47.791 position:50% align:center
I didn't know you'd gone
through Sisters' training, too.

00:11:47.874 --> 00:11:50.126 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI] Well, I did come
from the 1st, after all.

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:52.420 position:50% align:center
Though I've never put anyone
to rest in the field.

00:11:52.504 --> 00:11:53.338 position:50% align:center
You got this.

00:11:53.421 --> 00:11:55.298 position:50% align:center
Right! Let me at 'em!

00:11:55.382 --> 00:11:57.634 position:50% align:center
Whoa!

00:11:57.717 --> 00:11:58.843 position:50% align:center
Meow!

00:11:58.927 --> 00:12:00.470 position:50% align:center
Just my luck.

00:12:00.553 --> 00:12:02.597 position:50% align:center
Everything from the neck down?

00:12:02.681 --> 00:12:05.475 position:50% align:center
Yet somehow, the veil
managed to stay on?

00:12:05.558 --> 00:12:08.687 position:50% align:center
The bikini-and-veil's
a pretty specific kink.

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:10.563 position:50% align:center
But if that's how
you get to heaven,

00:12:10.647 --> 00:12:12.232 position:50% align:center
there's gotta be worse ways.

00:12:12.315 --> 00:12:14.901 position:50% align:center
Be professional. Come on.

00:12:17.904 --> 00:12:19.072 position:50% align:center
Look out!

00:12:19.155 --> 00:12:20.323 position:50% align:center
We can't put 'em to rest,
so what do we do?

00:12:20.407 --> 00:12:21.866 position:50% align:center
Hold on a second!

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:23.368 position:50% align:center
Uh, I'm getting dressed now!

00:12:23.451 --> 00:12:24.661 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:31.918 position:50% align:center
Hang tight, Vulcan.

00:12:32.002 --> 00:12:35.213 position:50% align:center
Right! This is one hell of
a bad situation, isn't it?

00:12:35.296 --> 00:12:36.381 position:50% align:center
Don't give up yet.

00:12:36.464 --> 00:12:39.801 position:50% align:center
I'm just about ready!
Wait a second! Ah!

00:12:39.884 --> 00:12:41.219 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
Oh, crap!

00:12:41.302 --> 00:12:42.095 position:50% align:center
Vulcan!

00:12:42.178 --> 00:12:43.304 position:50% align:center
Damn it, I'm toast!

00:12:43.388 --> 00:12:45.682 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:12:56.401 --> 00:12:59.571 position:50% align:center
[KARIM] Guess habits are
hard to break, Tamaki.

00:12:59.654 --> 00:13:02.907 position:50% align:center
You never even change
when you change.

00:13:02.991 --> 00:13:05.035 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
Lieutenant Karim!

00:13:14.794 --> 00:13:15.962 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA]
This is Hinawa.

00:13:16.046 --> 00:13:18.506 position:50% align:center
Lieutenant Karim from
the 1st has joined us.

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:20.842 position:50% align:center
[OBI] He's here now?
That's a huge help.

00:13:20.925 --> 00:13:22.260 position:50% align:center
I thought none of
the other companies

00:13:22.344 --> 00:13:24.596 position:50% align:center
were going to support us.

00:13:24.679 --> 00:13:26.681 position:50% align:center
Well, no, not officially.

00:13:26.765 --> 00:13:29.893 position:50% align:center
But I did make a few
personal requests.

00:13:29.976 --> 00:13:32.479 position:50% align:center
Apparently, you're short
on clerical support.

00:13:32.562 --> 00:13:34.105 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
I'm so glad you're here!

00:13:34.189 --> 00:13:36.691 position:50% align:center
We can put these
Infernals to rest!

00:13:38.485 --> 00:13:40.653 position:50% align:center
Right! Let's go!

00:13:51.247 --> 00:13:53.208 position:50% align:center
I need you to run after
the one who fled.

00:13:53.291 --> 00:13:54.167 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:56.544 position:50% align:center
Hey! Hold on!

00:13:56.628 --> 00:13:57.837 position:50% align:center
Move it!

00:13:58.797 --> 00:14:00.423 position:50% align:center
Let go of me!

00:14:00.507 --> 00:14:01.966 position:50% align:center
[CHARON'S MAN B]
Get down!

00:14:04.969 --> 00:14:07.138 position:50% align:center
[SHRINA yells]

00:14:09.349 --> 00:14:10.725 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Wait.

00:14:11.726 --> 00:14:14.979 position:50% align:center
Backdraft Bubblish Gum
should do the trick.

00:14:19.109 --> 00:14:21.569 position:50% align:center
It's you! From the 5th!

00:14:21.653 --> 00:14:23.238 position:50% align:center
Toru Kishiri!

00:14:23.321 --> 00:14:25.615 position:50% align:center
I got a message that things
were gettin' a little sticky

00:14:25.699 --> 00:14:27.951 position:50% align:center
for you guys over here.

00:14:28.034 --> 00:14:29.327 position:50% align:center
[CHARON'S MAN A]
Ah, another one.

00:14:29.411 --> 00:14:31.496 position:50% align:center
Hey, now calm down, fellas.

00:14:31.579 --> 00:14:33.123 position:50% align:center
I just happened to be
in the neighborhood

00:14:33.206 --> 00:14:34.457 position:50% align:center
and heard some commotion.

00:14:34.541 --> 00:14:36.167 position:50% align:center
I swear.

00:14:41.715 --> 00:14:44.759 position:50% align:center
Oh, snap. Hell of a show.

00:14:44.843 --> 00:14:46.511 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT]
Man, this is super dangerous,

00:14:46.594 --> 00:14:49.931 position:50% align:center
but I'm here... for some reason.

00:14:50.015 --> 00:14:52.475 position:50% align:center
Juggernaut, you, too?

00:14:52.559 --> 00:14:53.518 position:50% align:center
Get 'em!

00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:56.229 position:50% align:center
[whimpering]

00:15:01.901 --> 00:15:04.362 position:50% align:center
Guess we can't rush 'em.

[CHARON'S MEN scream]

00:15:17.584 --> 00:15:19.002 position:50% align:center
We're a pretty awesome team.

00:15:19.085 --> 00:15:20.462 position:50% align:center
I'll make sure they
give us some room,

00:15:20.545 --> 00:15:23.757 position:50% align:center
and you just keep on backin'
away and lettin' 'em rip!

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.967 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT]
Don't let them near us!

00:15:26.051 --> 00:15:28.011 position:50% align:center
We'll attack from
long range then.

00:15:28.094 --> 00:15:29.554 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir!

00:15:34.059 --> 00:15:36.770 position:50% align:center

I said stay back!

but you got this!

[JUGGERNAUT]
What?!

00:15:47.238 --> 00:15:49.532 position:50% align:center
I won't let them lay
a finger on that girl!

00:15:49.616 --> 00:15:53.828 position:50% align:center
Wait. Shinra Kusakabe,
where are you going?

00:15:53.912 --> 00:15:55.830 position:50% align:center
You chasing after Inca?

00:15:55.914 --> 00:15:58.208 position:50% align:center
Answer me, boy!

00:15:58.291 --> 00:16:01.294 position:50% align:center
I asked you a question!
So tell me!

Shut up, would ya?

00:16:24.776 --> 00:16:27.195 position:50% align:center
Stop that! Let the girl go!

00:16:27.278 --> 00:16:28.405 position:50% align:center
Just butt out!

00:16:28.488 --> 00:16:30.323 position:50% align:center
I told you I don't want
your boring safety.

00:16:30.407 --> 00:16:32.283 position:50% align:center
I want danger!

00:16:32.367 --> 00:16:35.537 position:50% align:center
But why? That's crazy.

[OBI] Sister, we gotta
put the next one to rest.

[IRIS]
Yes, sir.

00:16:59.853 --> 00:17:00.979 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
We call it a prayer,

00:17:01.062 --> 00:17:04.691 position:50% align:center
but she puts her entire
soul into her pleas.

00:17:04.774 --> 00:17:08.236 position:50% align:center
Even her strength and
concentration have their limits.

00:17:09.487 --> 00:17:11.114 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Are you okay, Sister?

00:17:11.197 --> 00:17:15.243 position:50% align:center
Oh. Well, there's nothing
wrong with me right now, sir.

[1ST SISTER A]
The flame is the soul's breath.

All right, Company 5,

00:17:36.973 --> 00:17:39.142 position:50% align:center
I need you to secure
an evacuation route!

[TAGUCHI] Captain Obi, I'm

here from the 5th.

00:17:55.784 --> 00:17:57.786 position:50% align:center
Thank you for answering my call.

00:17:57.869 --> 00:18:00.747 position:50% align:center
I truly appreciate your
assistance with this.

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:02.916 position:50% align:center
I'm just glad to
be of help, sir.

00:18:02.999 --> 00:18:06.920 position:50% align:center
Heard a lot about you since
your days as a firefighter.

00:18:07.003 --> 00:18:08.838 position:50% align:center
It's a real honor.

00:18:10.674 --> 00:18:13.468 position:50% align:center
Company 2, let's put
those Infernals to rest!

00:18:13.551 --> 00:18:15.053 position:50% align:center
[TOKUYAMA]
Company 5, secure the route

00:18:15.136 --> 00:18:16.805 position:50% align:center

[CREW MEMBERS]
Yes, sir!

Wow, Captain, there are
so many. It's amazing, huh?

00:18:24.479 --> 00:18:26.189 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:18:26.272 --> 00:18:30.610 position:50% align:center
We're all working to protect
the people--it's what unites us.

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:38.159 position:50% align:center
Look at it all burn.

00:18:38.243 --> 00:18:41.162 position:50% align:center
There's nothing more
beautiful, if you ask me.

00:18:41.246 --> 00:18:43.456 position:50% align:center
Throw as many Fire Soldiers
as you want at it,

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:46.501 position:50% align:center
it's not gonna help one bit.

Oh, crap. It's you again.

Take her out.

00:19:01.808 --> 00:19:05.145 position:50% align:center
Heh. So you're the
enemy commander, huh?

00:19:05.228 --> 00:19:08.523 position:50% align:center
I challenge you to
a duel! One on one!

00:19:08.606 --> 00:19:12.027 position:50% align:center
Yo. I've got a problem here,
Charon. Hurry it up.

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:14.446 position:50% align:center
I am not joining up with
either one of you guys!

00:19:14.529 --> 00:19:17.198 position:50% align:center
So you better get your grabby
hands off me right now!

00:19:17.282 --> 00:19:19.159 position:50% align:center

I've had just about enough
of you, you big oaf!

00:19:30.837 --> 00:19:33.173 position:50% align:center
So get lost!

00:19:34.299 --> 00:19:35.759 position:50% align:center

Screw you. Shut your mouth!

[SHINRA] Still, it doesn't
seem like my Rapid

00:20:01.076 --> 00:20:03.370 position:50% align:center
has any kind of effect on him.

00:20:08.625 --> 00:20:12.253 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] He triggers
explosions just by walking.

00:20:12.337 --> 00:20:15.173 position:50% align:center
So could I, if I put
my mind to it.

00:20:15.256 --> 00:20:17.258 position:50% align:center
Let's give it a try.

00:20:20.512 --> 00:20:23.056 position:50% align:center
The flame is the soul's breath.

00:20:23.139 --> 00:20:25.517 position:50% align:center
The black smoke is
the soul's release.

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:27.394 position:50% align:center
Fire!

00:20:29.521 --> 00:20:31.314 position:50% align:center
[SISTERS]
Ashes thou wert and art.

00:20:31.398 --> 00:20:35.694 position:50% align:center
May thy soul return to
the great flame of fire.

00:20:35.777 --> 00:20:37.320 position:50% align:center
<i>Látom.</i>

00:20:43.952 --> 00:20:46.454 position:50% align:center
Captain Obi, the Infernals
are being put to rest

00:20:46.538 --> 00:20:48.206 position:50% align:center
like clockwork now.

00:20:48.289 --> 00:20:51.251 position:50% align:center
But I'm wondering how we'll
handle all these fires.

00:20:51.334 --> 00:20:54.754 position:50% align:center
[OBI] The way things are headed,
the whole town's gonna burn.

00:21:04.097 --> 00:21:06.266 position:50% align:center
Return to the great
flame of fire.

00:21:06.349 --> 00:21:08.101 position:50% align:center
<i>Látom.</i>

00:21:09.102 --> 00:21:11.646 position:50% align:center
Now, all we gotta deal with

00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:14.482 position:50% align:center
is this one-horned
bastard over here.

00:21:17.402 --> 00:21:20.280 position:50% align:center
[roars]

00:21:25.827 --> 00:21:27.245 position:50% align:center
This sucks!

00:21:27.328 --> 00:21:30.373 position:50% align:center
I can't send out any orders
when you're around, ya know?

00:21:30.457 --> 00:21:33.084 position:50% align:center
Well, it's about to get
a lot worse for you.

00:21:33.168 --> 00:21:33.877 position:50% align:center
[HAUMEA]
Hmph.

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:36.004 position:50% align:center
Oh, you really think so?

00:21:36.087 --> 00:21:40.383 position:50% align:center
Well, the Fifth Pillar
is ours already.

00:21:40.467 --> 00:21:41.676 position:50% align:center
Which means we're on our way

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:44.512 position:50% align:center
to assembling the
Eight Key Pillars.

00:21:44.596 --> 00:21:47.307 position:50% align:center
Let me go!
I'm no one's property!

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:50.018 position:50% align:center
Release me, or you're
gonna be sorry!

00:21:50.101 --> 00:21:53.772 position:50% align:center
So that just leaves
you, Fourth Pillar.

00:21:55.982 --> 00:21:58.777 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] I'm not gonna
beat him like this.

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:02.697 position:50% align:center
But... when I was training
with Captain Shinmon,

00:22:02.781 --> 00:22:07.577 position:50% align:center
there was one particular kata
that caused an explosion.

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:10.330 position:50% align:center
You wanna learn the
devil-horn Corna, huh?

00:22:10.413 --> 00:22:11.539 position:50% align:center
It's as simple as stickin' out

00:22:11.623 --> 00:22:13.875 position:50% align:center
your index and pinky
fingers like so.

00:22:13.958 --> 00:22:16.544 position:50% align:center
That'll fill ya with
the power of rock.

00:22:19.255 --> 00:22:21.925 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Guess I'll give it a try.

00:22:22.008 --> 00:22:25.178 position:50% align:center
I've got some heat
for ya, ya big gorilla!

00:22:29.099 --> 00:22:32.936 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] The form I learned
from Captain Obi himself.

00:22:35.897 --> 00:22:37.774 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
The Corna!

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:23.463 position:50% align:center
[IRIS] Shinra faces off against
the White-Clad Charon.

00:24:23.546 --> 00:24:25.507 position:50% align:center
And while fighting an uphill
battle against a foe

00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:27.133 position:50% align:center
he can't seem to
lay a scratch on,

00:24:27.217 --> 00:24:29.344 position:50% align:center
he finally figures
out the secret.

00:24:29.427 --> 00:24:32.263 position:50% align:center
Now, Shinra! It's time to
rock your finishing move!

00:24:32.347 --> 00:24:35.058 position:50% align:center
[CHARON]
You're not gonna touch me!

00:24:35.141 --> 00:24:36.893 position:50% align:center
