00:11:02.495 --> 00:11:06.499 position:50% align:center
My servants, we cannot
allow anyone to interfere.

00:11:06.583 --> 00:11:09.919 position:50% align:center
It is time for you to
perform your final labor!

00:11:10.003 --> 00:11:12.213 position:50% align:center
Repose and glory
in the afterlife

00:11:12.297 --> 00:11:15.467 position:50% align:center
will only be granted to those
who served me in this life.

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:20.138 position:50% align:center
Your unyielding devotion will
be rewarded for all eternity!

00:11:20.221 --> 00:11:22.265 position:50% align:center
I call on you in
this time of need.

00:11:22.349 --> 00:11:25.352 position:50% align:center
Perform one last labor
to show your loyalty!

00:11:25.435 --> 00:11:29.064 position:50% align:center
Kill anyone who would
dare stand in our way!

00:11:29.147 --> 00:11:30.565 position:50% align:center
Do this for me.

00:11:30.648 --> 00:11:34.110 position:50% align:center
Kneel down before me
and bow your heads to me!

00:11:34.194 --> 00:11:37.072 position:50% align:center
This is the path to salvation!

00:11:37.155 --> 00:11:39.657 position:50% align:center
The only way to be released
from your suffering,

00:11:39.741 --> 00:11:41.701 position:50% align:center
from these burning bodies!

00:11:41.785 --> 00:11:43.703 position:50% align:center
[INFERNALS]
For thee.

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:50.335 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI] Return to the
great flame of fire.

00:11:50.418 --> 00:11:52.295 position:50% align:center
<i>LÃ¡tom.</i>

00:11:52.379 --> 00:11:54.547 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA, OGUN sigh]

00:11:54.631 --> 00:11:56.466 position:50% align:center
So here's the situation.

00:11:56.549 --> 00:12:00.178 position:50% align:center
From what we know so far,
they plan to use the Tabernacle

00:12:00.261 --> 00:12:02.472 position:50% align:center
to try and destroy
the entire world.

00:12:02.555 --> 00:12:05.934 position:50% align:center
That's right, but since they
haven't made it happen yet,

00:12:06.017 --> 00:12:08.228 position:50% align:center
you gotta wonder if these
guys still might be missing

00:12:08.311 --> 00:12:10.397 position:50% align:center
some critical piece
of the puzzle.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.566 position:50% align:center
Well, Scop, is there anything
else you can think of?

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:15.193 position:50% align:center
Anything could help.

00:12:15.276 --> 00:12:18.697 position:50% align:center
[SCOP]
Hmm... Yeah, let's see.

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:20.031 position:50% align:center
[YATA]
I just remembered.

00:12:20.115 --> 00:12:22.701 position:50% align:center
I have seen them collecting
those stone tablets.

00:12:22.784 --> 00:12:24.786 position:50% align:center
[SCOP]
You're right, so have I.

00:12:24.869 --> 00:12:26.287 position:50% align:center
Oh, really?

00:12:26.371 --> 00:12:28.039 position:50% align:center
[SCOP] Yeah, and from the rate
they were collecting them,

00:12:28.123 --> 00:12:30.333 position:50% align:center
they probably have a
bunch of them by now.

00:12:30.417 --> 00:12:31.835 position:50% align:center
Well, maybe they're a key.

00:12:31.918 --> 00:12:34.421 position:50% align:center
Some means to activate
the Tabernacle's power.

00:12:34.504 --> 00:12:35.714 position:50% align:center
[YATA]
I don't know.

00:12:35.797 --> 00:12:37.924 position:50% align:center
But I'm positive these
so-called "Infernals"

00:12:38.008 --> 00:12:41.511 position:50% align:center
were instructed to gather
the tablets by their leader.

00:12:41.594 --> 00:12:44.180 position:50% align:center
The one that has two
terrifyingly pointy horns

00:12:44.264 --> 00:12:45.974 position:50% align:center
growing out of his
head like this.

00:12:46.057 --> 00:12:46.766 position:50% align:center
What?

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:47.642 position:50% align:center
He's got horns?

00:12:47.726 --> 00:12:49.352 position:50% align:center
That mean he's a demon Infernal.

00:12:49.436 --> 00:12:50.812 position:50% align:center
[SCOP]
A demon?

00:12:50.895 --> 00:12:53.565 position:50% align:center
Well, if that's the case,
then it sure changes things.

00:12:53.648 --> 00:12:54.858 position:50% align:center
[whistle blows]

00:12:54.941 --> 00:12:57.610 position:50% align:center
[YATA] Why? Are they
that much stronger?

00:12:57.694 --> 00:12:59.154 position:50% align:center
From what I know about demons,

00:12:59.237 --> 00:13:02.032 position:50% align:center
it takes a crapload of
firepower to put one down.

00:13:02.115 --> 00:13:05.618 position:50% align:center
Impossible for our
little group to pull off.

00:13:07.662 --> 00:13:10.206 position:50% align:center
The only real option we
have is to turn back.

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:13.460 position:50% align:center
[PAN] If there's a demon here,
we can't control the area.

00:13:13.543 --> 00:13:17.213 position:50% align:center
[whistle blows]

00:13:17.297 --> 00:13:20.633 position:50% align:center
However, we can't ignore what
they're trying to accomplish--

00:13:20.717 --> 00:13:23.553 position:50% align:center
using the Tabernacle to
trigger a cataclysm.

00:13:23.636 --> 00:13:25.847 position:50% align:center
Come on, Licht, you've
gotta have some ideas

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:27.724 position:50% align:center
about how to beat the demon.

00:13:27.807 --> 00:13:31.770 position:50% align:center
Let's see, last time, it was
a miracle we had all that help.

00:13:31.853 --> 00:13:35.357 position:50% align:center
Tons of people working together
to put that one to rest.

00:13:36.858 --> 00:13:38.693 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Anyway, the amount
of firepower we would need

00:13:38.777 --> 00:13:40.278 position:50% align:center
would roast the whole forest.

00:13:40.362 --> 00:13:42.614 position:50% align:center
Say what? No way in hell!

00:13:42.697 --> 00:13:44.115 position:50% align:center
Hold up a second.

00:13:44.199 --> 00:13:45.909 position:50% align:center
I thought we were only here
to check out the Tabernacle,

00:13:45.992 --> 00:13:46.993 position:50% align:center
so why the hell're
we talkin' 'bout

00:13:47.077 --> 00:13:48.203 position:50% align:center
putting this demon to rest?

00:13:48.286 --> 00:13:51.247 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Because we can't
let this happen!

00:13:51.331 --> 00:13:53.500 position:50% align:center
Listen, if we can't
put it to rest,

00:13:53.583 --> 00:13:55.585 position:50% align:center
we can at least slow it down.

00:13:55.669 --> 00:13:57.253 position:50% align:center
We can distract it somehow

00:13:57.337 --> 00:14:00.548 position:50% align:center
n'see what's up with the
Tabernacle while it's busy.

00:14:02.092 --> 00:14:04.928 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty good at
raising hell, ya know.

00:14:05.011 --> 00:14:06.346 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:14:06.429 --> 00:14:07.764 position:50% align:center
Here's what we'll do.

00:14:07.847 --> 00:14:09.808 position:50% align:center
A team will go inside
the Tabernacle.

00:14:09.891 --> 00:14:13.436 position:50% align:center
Shinra and Ogun will use their
mobility to distract the demon.

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:14.854 position:50% align:center
While that happens,

00:14:14.938 --> 00:14:17.941 position:50% align:center
Arthur, Tamaki, and
Juggernaut will stand guard.

00:14:18.024 --> 00:14:19.526 position:50% align:center
[OTHERS]
Yes, sir!

00:14:19.609 --> 00:14:23.363 position:50% align:center
That means Inspector Licht and I
will investigate the Tabernacle.

00:14:23.446 --> 00:14:26.032 position:50% align:center
Are you sure you can't just
get rid of those ghouls?

00:14:26.116 --> 00:14:28.326 position:50% align:center
[PAN] We're here,
so we'll do our best.

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:30.912 position:50% align:center
Which is to put a
stop to their plan.

00:14:30.995 --> 00:14:35.333 position:50% align:center
That's all we can hope for.
At least, with our manpower.

00:14:38.003 --> 00:14:39.963 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Don't worry, Scop.

00:14:40.046 --> 00:14:41.715 position:50% align:center
I'll take this place
back for you.

00:14:41.798 --> 00:14:43.925 position:50% align:center
[SCOP]
You mean it?

00:14:44.009 --> 00:14:46.428 position:50% align:center
And take the demon
down as a bonus.

00:14:46.511 --> 00:14:48.471 position:50% align:center
After all, I'm a hero.

00:14:48.555 --> 00:14:49.973 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:50.056 --> 00:14:52.308 position:50% align:center
Hero!

00:14:58.773 --> 00:15:01.735 position:50% align:center
[SCOP] That's the entrance
to the Tabernacle.

00:15:05.655 --> 00:15:07.699 position:50% align:center
Nobody's around.

00:15:07.782 --> 00:15:10.452 position:50% align:center
All right, we're
gonna go in now.

00:15:27.218 --> 00:15:28.345 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
Anything?

00:15:28.428 --> 00:15:30.055 position:50% align:center
Well, we scoped out the place,

00:15:30.138 --> 00:15:33.183 position:50% align:center
but there's no sign of the
demon or any other Infernals.

00:15:33.266 --> 00:15:35.393 position:50% align:center
It's clear all the way
to the inner chambers.

00:15:35.477 --> 00:15:38.021 position:50% align:center
That's good.
In fact, it's perfect.

00:15:38.104 --> 00:15:39.856 position:50% align:center
Let's change up the plan.

00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:42.442 position:50% align:center
Shinra, Ogun,
Tamaki, Juggernaut,

00:15:42.525 --> 00:15:45.028 position:50% align:center
you'll stand guard outside.

00:15:45.111 --> 00:15:48.031 position:50% align:center
Arthur, you'll be coming
with Licht and me,

00:15:48.114 --> 00:15:49.491 position:50% align:center
in case we need you.

00:15:49.574 --> 00:15:50.825 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR, TAMAKI]
Roger.

00:15:50.909 --> 00:15:53.244 position:50% align:center
Now let's split up.

00:15:53.328 --> 00:15:54.454 position:50% align:center
[whistle blows]

00:15:54.537 --> 00:15:55.914 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
Shh.

00:15:55.997 --> 00:15:57.123 position:50% align:center
[YATA]
Idiot!

00:15:57.207 --> 00:15:59.459 position:50% align:center
My bad, sorry.

00:16:06.508 --> 00:16:09.010 position:50% align:center
It's dark, but it's
in pretty good shape.

00:16:09.094 --> 00:16:11.388 position:50% align:center
This place has been
here for 250 years?

00:16:11.471 --> 00:16:13.556 position:50% align:center
[YATA] Well, it's no
coincidence, braniac.

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:16.893 position:50% align:center
That's because we've been taking
care of it the whole time.

00:16:18.603 --> 00:16:20.939 position:50% align:center
I guess these are the tablets.

00:16:21.022 --> 00:16:23.149 position:50% align:center
What do the numbers mean?

00:16:31.408 --> 00:16:32.534 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:16:32.617 --> 00:16:34.285 position:50% align:center
It's a trap.

00:16:37.539 --> 00:16:38.623 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:16:41.209 --> 00:16:42.335 position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:16:45.505 --> 00:16:47.549 position:50% align:center
Some behind us, too.

00:16:47.632 --> 00:16:50.093 position:50% align:center
They've got us surrounded.

00:16:50.176 --> 00:16:51.678 position:50% align:center
[TEMPE laughing]

00:16:51.761 --> 00:16:53.638 position:50% align:center
[TEMPE]
Walked right into it.

00:16:53.722 --> 00:16:57.225 position:50% align:center
I'd heard there were some
nosy humans lurking around.

00:16:57.308 --> 00:16:59.686 position:50% align:center
Did these Infernals
really set a trap for us?

00:16:59.769 --> 00:17:02.939 position:50% align:center
I mean, I thought that
they couldn't think.

00:17:03.023 --> 00:17:05.025 position:50% align:center
Hey, look! That one!

00:17:07.068 --> 00:17:07.944 position:50% align:center
Those horns.

00:17:08.028 --> 00:17:09.362 position:50% align:center
Demon.

00:17:09.446 --> 00:17:11.031 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT] Oh, this is bad,
you guys. We gotta run!

00:17:11.114 --> 00:17:12.949 position:50% align:center
We can't leave the rest
of the team inside there,

00:17:13.033 --> 00:17:14.242 position:50% align:center
you scaredy-cat!

00:17:14.325 --> 00:17:18.538 position:50% align:center
[TEMPE] How dare you violate
our sacred ground!

00:17:18.621 --> 00:17:20.457 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
We have to buy some more time.

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:23.126 position:50% align:center
No matter what, we can't
let them get inside!

00:17:23.209 --> 00:17:27.714 position:50% align:center
[TEMPE] Now! Kill those
who stand in our way!

00:17:32.552 --> 00:17:35.722 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT]
Why do they all wanna chase me?!

00:17:37.182 --> 00:17:39.601 position:50% align:center
[TEMPE] This is our temple
on sacred ground.

00:17:39.684 --> 00:17:42.228 position:50% align:center
You will not violate it
under any circumstance!

00:17:42.312 --> 00:17:43.855 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah?

00:17:46.483 --> 00:17:49.319 position:50% align:center
It belongs to the animals!
It's their oasis!

00:17:49.402 --> 00:17:52.238 position:50% align:center
You're the ones who came
in here and violated it!

00:17:52.322 --> 00:17:53.948 position:50% align:center
So you don't get a say!

00:17:54.032 --> 00:17:56.493 position:50% align:center
You should've coexisted
with them!

00:17:56.576 --> 00:17:58.244 position:50% align:center
[TEMPE]
Are you insane?

00:17:58.328 --> 00:18:02.290 position:50% align:center
What you call the "Tabernacle"
is a weapon of mass destruction!

00:18:02.374 --> 00:18:06.586 position:50% align:center
Using it to create an oasis
goes against its purpose.

00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:12.717 position:50% align:center
Instead, I will burn
this all to ashes!

00:18:14.928 --> 00:18:17.347 position:50% align:center
Why the hell do you wanna
destroy the world, anyway?

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:22.060 position:50% align:center
[TEMPE] Because that's how
I'll achieve eternal salvation!

00:18:27.691 --> 00:18:29.776 position:50% align:center
Come on. We're trying
to save the forest!

00:18:29.859 --> 00:18:30.735 position:50% align:center
Sorry!

00:18:30.819 --> 00:18:32.237 position:50% align:center
For eternal salvation?

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.114 position:50% align:center
What are you talking about?

00:18:34.197 --> 00:18:36.408 position:50% align:center
[TEMPE] I've wandered since
the Great Cataclysm,

00:18:36.491 --> 00:18:39.994 position:50% align:center
unable to die, for two
and a half centuries.

00:18:40.078 --> 00:18:42.914 position:50% align:center
All I want is death to take me!

00:18:42.997 --> 00:18:44.457 position:50% align:center
But for that to happen,

00:18:44.541 --> 00:18:47.794 position:50% align:center
I need an explosion so large
it would raze this very temple.

00:18:47.877 --> 00:18:50.547 position:50% align:center
And when one as grand
as I passes on,

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:53.174 position:50% align:center
they require servants to
care for them in Heaven.

00:18:53.258 --> 00:18:55.552 position:50% align:center
The aftershock of the blast
may wipe out everything

00:18:55.635 --> 00:18:57.470 position:50% align:center
as far as your seaport,

00:18:57.554 --> 00:18:59.973 position:50% align:center
but I will allow those
who lose their lives

00:19:00.056 --> 00:19:02.809 position:50% align:center
the honor of serving
me in the afterlife.

00:19:02.892 --> 00:19:05.186 position:50% align:center
[CLOAKED INFERNALS]
Oh, Master Tempe!

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:07.647 position:50% align:center
We will follow you to
the end and beyond!

00:19:07.731 --> 00:19:10.817 position:50% align:center
[TEMPE] Will you join me in
my journey to the afterlife?

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:14.154 position:50% align:center
I can find some worthwhile
way you can serve me there!

00:19:14.237 --> 00:19:16.781 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT] All I can do is
grow potatoes, Master Tempe!

00:19:16.865 --> 00:19:18.783 position:50% align:center
Are you saying you
wanna serve him?!

00:19:18.867 --> 00:19:20.326 position:50% align:center
I can't believe you
would seriously

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:22.996 position:50% align:center
take away the lives of others
just so you could die.

00:19:23.079 --> 00:19:24.330 position:50% align:center
Screw you, buddy!

00:19:24.414 --> 00:19:26.958 position:50% align:center
If you wanna die,
you do it on your own!

00:19:27.042 --> 00:19:30.503 position:50% align:center
You're right, but
that's hard to pull off.

00:19:30.587 --> 00:19:31.838 position:50% align:center
He said it.

00:19:31.921 --> 00:19:34.591 position:50% align:center
The firepower to take him
out is about the same

00:19:34.674 --> 00:19:37.594 position:50% align:center
as what would eliminate this
entire forest, at least.

00:19:37.677 --> 00:19:41.014 position:50% align:center
So you mean... we would have
to sacrifice the forest?

00:19:41.097 --> 00:19:43.933 position:50% align:center
What are we gonna do about
a demon we can't put to rest?

00:19:44.017 --> 00:19:46.436 position:50% align:center
There's nothing else we can do!

00:19:46.519 --> 00:19:48.521 position:50% align:center
Our only option is to fight!

00:19:48.605 --> 00:19:50.190 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:19:51.149 --> 00:19:53.485 position:50% align:center
[TEMPE]
What do you think you're doing?

00:19:55.487 --> 00:19:59.449 position:50% align:center
[TEMPE]
Tempe's Holy Light!

00:19:59.532 --> 00:20:01.785 position:50% align:center
[INFERNAL A, INFERNAL B]
For thee!

00:20:01.868 --> 00:20:03.828 position:50% align:center
[TEMPE]
This is the blessing of light.

00:20:03.912 --> 00:20:10.460 position:50% align:center
One only granted to those
chosen to perish with me!

00:20:15.215 --> 00:20:16.549 position:50% align:center
[SCOP]
Huh? Shinra!

00:20:16.633 --> 00:20:18.635 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI] We can't beat
that demon on our own!

00:20:18.718 --> 00:20:19.886 position:50% align:center
The best we can hope for now

00:20:19.969 --> 00:20:22.222 position:50% align:center
is to try and buy
a little more time!

00:20:22.305 --> 00:20:24.474 position:50% align:center
Buying time isn't
going to cut it!

00:20:24.557 --> 00:20:26.142 position:50% align:center
If we don't stop him
right here and now,

00:20:26.226 --> 00:20:27.560 position:50% align:center
he's gonna blow up
the Tabernacle

00:20:27.644 --> 00:20:29.145 position:50% align:center
and lives will be lost!

00:20:29.229 --> 00:20:31.022 position:50% align:center
Ours and everybody in town!

00:20:31.106 --> 00:20:32.273 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT]
Yeah!

00:20:32.357 --> 00:20:33.525 position:50% align:center
And it'll burn up all
those precious potatoes!

00:20:33.608 --> 00:20:35.902 position:50% align:center
There are bigger things
to worry about, ya know!

00:20:35.985 --> 00:20:37.654 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT]
I know, but still.

00:20:37.737 --> 00:20:39.823 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] We've got two
things we need to do:

00:20:39.906 --> 00:20:43.785 position:50% align:center
Investigate the Tabernacle
and put this demon to rest.

00:20:43.868 --> 00:20:45.161 position:50% align:center
Let's go.

00:20:45.245 --> 00:20:47.539 position:50% align:center
We gotta throw all the firepower
we have at this guy.

00:20:47.622 --> 00:20:48.248 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:20:48.331 --> 00:20:48.957 position:50% align:center
You got it!

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:50.500 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT whines]

00:20:50.583 --> 00:20:52.002 position:50% align:center
[TEMPE]
By going against me,

00:20:52.085 --> 00:20:54.379 position:50% align:center
you will lose your
status in Heaven.

00:20:54.462 --> 00:20:56.172 position:50% align:center
Go to hell!

00:20:56.256 --> 00:20:57.757 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Okay.

00:20:57.841 --> 00:21:00.635 position:50% align:center
How is our little group gonna
put down this demon for good?

00:21:00.719 --> 00:21:02.804 position:50% align:center
What can we do to get
the same kinda firepower

00:21:02.887 --> 00:21:05.640 position:50% align:center
as Captain Shinmon?

00:21:05.724 --> 00:21:07.142 position:50% align:center
The Adolla Link!

00:21:07.225 --> 00:21:09.310 position:50% align:center
If I can somehow get the
Grace of the Evangelist,

00:21:09.394 --> 00:21:12.188 position:50% align:center
like that time with Sho,
that might be enough.

00:21:12.272 --> 00:21:15.859 position:50% align:center
Not gonna happen. The Evangelist
isn't even on our side.

00:21:15.942 --> 00:21:19.487 position:50% align:center
Besides, I'm way out here,
probably too far to get a link.

00:21:19.571 --> 00:21:20.822 position:50% align:center
Lieutenant Pan and the others

00:21:20.905 --> 00:21:22.991 position:50% align:center
are probably coming outta
there any minute now.

00:21:23.074 --> 00:21:25.368 position:50% align:center
Once they do, I can
get a power-up buff.

00:21:25.452 --> 00:21:26.578 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:26.661 --> 00:21:28.872 position:50% align:center
What's up? Have a plan?

00:21:36.796 --> 00:21:39.883 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
That was weird. An Adolla Link?

00:21:40.925 --> 00:21:42.052 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
Now what?

00:21:42.135 --> 00:21:44.637 position:50% align:center
I can get us outta here
with my Excalibur.

00:21:44.721 --> 00:21:46.514 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Yeah, I vote that
we let Shinra and them

00:21:46.598 --> 00:21:47.807 position:50% align:center
deal with the ruckus outside

00:21:47.891 --> 00:21:49.392 position:50% align:center
while we stay in here
to investigate.

00:21:49.476 --> 00:21:50.560 position:50% align:center
[PAN]
Agreed.

00:21:50.643 --> 00:21:52.562 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
I'll admit, I'm not exactly sure

00:21:52.645 --> 00:21:55.815 position:50% align:center
what these number sequences
are supposed to mean.

00:21:55.899 --> 00:21:58.401 position:50% align:center
They stretch out all
the way over there.

00:21:58.485 --> 00:22:00.779 position:50% align:center
You think it could be a code?

00:22:00.862 --> 00:22:02.364 position:50% align:center
I don't.

00:22:02.447 --> 00:22:05.116 position:50% align:center
If it were a code, there would
be some regular pattern to them.

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:08.745 position:50% align:center
But from what I see, these
numbers are all over the place.

00:22:08.828 --> 00:22:09.829 position:50% align:center
Caw!

00:22:09.913 --> 00:22:10.955 position:50% align:center
We've seen these before,

00:22:11.039 --> 00:22:13.333 position:50% align:center
but they don't seem
to mean anything.

00:22:13.416 --> 00:22:15.752 position:50% align:center
They may not mean
anything to you and me,

00:22:15.835 --> 00:22:17.671 position:50% align:center
but they meant something
to whoever decided

00:22:17.754 --> 00:22:19.798 position:50% align:center
to put 'em on these tablets.

00:22:19.881 --> 00:22:22.967 position:50% align:center
Look, there's more
numbers up there.

00:22:23.051 --> 00:22:24.969 position:50% align:center
They're everywhere.

00:22:25.053 --> 00:22:27.138 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Random number sequences.

00:22:27.222 --> 00:22:28.181 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
Hark...

00:22:28.264 --> 00:22:29.265 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Figuring out what they mean

00:22:29.349 --> 00:22:30.892 position:50% align:center
is not gonna be a
walk in the park.

00:22:30.975 --> 00:22:32.686 position:50% align:center
[LICHT, PAN]
Hm?

00:22:32.769 --> 00:22:35.647 position:50% align:center
Courageous Arthur Died Epically.

00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:38.858 position:50% align:center
Hey, guys. This is pi, right?

00:22:41.903 --> 00:22:43.488 position:50% align:center
--[LICHT] Aww.
--[PAN] Huh?

00:24:19.918 --> 00:24:21.961 position:50% align:center
[IRIS] Arthur and the others
inside the Tabernacle

00:24:22.045 --> 00:24:24.964 position:50% align:center
finally make their way
to the central core.

00:24:25.048 --> 00:24:29.177 position:50% align:center
There, they hear an eerie pulse
echoing, like a heartbeat.

00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:31.471 position:50% align:center
That's actually kinda scary.

00:24:31.554 --> 00:24:33.598 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Is there something
alive in there?

00:24:33.682 --> 00:24:35.308 position:50% align:center
[IRIS]
