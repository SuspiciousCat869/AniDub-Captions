00:00:11.803 --> 00:00:14.597 position:50% align:center
Then do it, you big dummy!

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:16.224 position:50% align:center

[gasps]

00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:33.236 position:50% align:center
This thing's really
freakin' tough!

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.865 position:50% align:center
Please, go away. Go away!

00:02:37.907 --> 00:02:39.868 position:50% align:center
The radioactive decay's
just not stopping.

00:02:39.951 --> 00:02:42.162 position:50% align:center
Radioactivity level's
still climbing like crazy!

00:02:42.245 --> 00:02:44.706 position:50% align:center
We gotta end this
quickly, Shinra!

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:46.249 position:50% align:center
Try to calm down, Nataku!

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:48.126 position:50% align:center
[whimpering]

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.047 position:50% align:center

I'm doing the best I can!

00:02:53.923 --> 00:02:56.760 position:50% align:center
[NATAKU]
Please! I can't do anymore!

00:02:58.928 --> 00:03:00.263 position:50% align:center
[NATAKU'S MOTHER]
Another hundred!

00:03:00.347 --> 00:03:03.475 position:50% align:center
You're so amazing!
Always working so hard!

00:03:03.558 --> 00:03:05.435 position:50% align:center
And someday, you're
going to be a doctor;

00:03:05.518 --> 00:03:07.937 position:50% align:center
saving lives just
like your father.

00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:09.147 position:50% align:center
I know you can do it!

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.941 position:50% align:center
You've got such a bright
future ahead of you!

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:14.819 position:50% align:center
[NATAKU]
No, Mom. You don't understand.

00:03:14.903 --> 00:03:17.322 position:50% align:center
I have to because
you expect so much.

00:03:17.405 --> 00:03:21.868 position:50% align:center
I mean, remember that one
time I got a bad grade?

00:03:21.951 --> 00:03:25.580 position:50% align:center
Ugh! What am I going
to tell your father?

00:03:25.663 --> 00:03:26.915 position:50% align:center
[NATAKU'S FATHER]
You're starting to let him slip;

00:03:26.998 --> 00:03:28.124 position:50% align:center
you're too easy on him!

00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:29.834 position:50% align:center
[NATAKU]
I'm sorry, Mom.

00:03:29.918 --> 00:03:34.422 position:50% align:center
I'll try harder next time,
I promise. Please.

00:03:35.256 --> 00:03:36.508 position:50% align:center
[NATAKU'S MOTHER]
Are you serious?

00:03:36.591 --> 00:03:39.511 position:50% align:center
Nataku is a third generation?

00:03:39.594 --> 00:03:42.305 position:50% align:center
You're taking him to
a Haijima facility?

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:45.141 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, I know
you'll be home real soon.

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:48.103 position:50% align:center
You won't let a little flame
get the best of you.

00:03:48.186 --> 00:03:51.981 position:50% align:center
You've got this.
You can do it, right?

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:54.067 position:50% align:center
Yes, I can.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.735 position:50% align:center
You promise me?

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:57.737 position:50% align:center
Yes, Mother.

00:03:58.655 --> 00:04:02.117 position:50% align:center
[RESEARCHER A] Okay,
let's begin the experiment.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.370 position:50% align:center
We're hoping for
something good today.

00:04:05.453 --> 00:04:07.372 position:50% align:center
You can do it?

00:04:07.455 --> 00:04:08.748 position:50% align:center
Yes, Mom.

00:04:08.832 --> 00:04:10.709 position:50% align:center
[NATAKU] I can do it,
I can do it, I can do it...

00:04:10.792 --> 00:04:12.669 position:50% align:center
[REKKA] You can do it,
you can do it, you can do it.

00:04:12.752 --> 00:04:15.213 position:50% align:center
You can do it, you can do it!

00:04:15.296 --> 00:04:18.800 position:50% align:center
You ready for a test with
your Uncle Reaper today?

00:04:18.883 --> 00:04:22.971 position:50% align:center
There's a chance that you
might die, but you can do it.

00:04:23.054 --> 00:04:24.472 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir.

00:04:24.556 --> 00:04:27.350 position:50% align:center
[NATAKU] I will.
Don't worry, I know I can.

00:04:27.434 --> 00:04:29.644 position:50% align:center
[REKKA]
Do it!

00:04:29.728 --> 00:04:31.146 position:50% align:center
[NATAKU]
I don't have a choice.

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:34.816 position:50% align:center
I have to be smarter.
I have to be stronger.

00:04:34.899 --> 00:04:36.651 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Nataku.

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:43.533 position:50% align:center
Just now, what was that?
Such a weird feeling...

00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:45.744 position:50% align:center
Just take it easy, okay?
Listen to me for just a--!

00:04:45.827 --> 00:04:49.581 position:50% align:center
Stop it! Stop looking
inside my head!

00:04:49.664 --> 00:04:51.458 position:50% align:center
Don't let your power
consume you!

00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:53.251 position:50% align:center
It'll be okay, because
you're strong enough to--

00:04:53.335 --> 00:04:54.961 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you bet I am!

00:04:55.045 --> 00:04:59.924 position:50% align:center
That's why I can do it!
I know I can! Just watch me!

00:05:00.008 --> 00:05:04.012 position:50% align:center
The radiation level spiked!
Shinra! Get outta there, now!

00:05:04.095 --> 00:05:06.514 position:50% align:center
You've gotta be kidding me.

00:05:06.598 --> 00:05:10.769 position:50% align:center
That's a ridiculous amount
of energy. It's insane.

00:05:10.852 --> 00:05:12.604 position:50% align:center
[INCA gasps]

00:05:15.732 --> 00:05:17.776 position:50% align:center
I can see what's gonna happen.

00:05:17.859 --> 00:05:19.611 position:50% align:center
If that thing lands
a direct hit,

00:05:19.694 --> 00:05:22.489 position:50% align:center
it'll blast a crater
500 kilometers wide.

00:05:22.572 --> 00:05:25.658 position:50% align:center
There's no way we could run
away from something that big!

00:05:28.244 --> 00:05:30.455 position:50% align:center
[OBI] You stay over
here, Sister, okay?

00:05:30.538 --> 00:05:31.790 position:50% align:center
[IRIS]
Yes, sir.

00:05:31.873 --> 00:05:34.000 position:50% align:center
Yeah, no. That won't help.

00:05:34.084 --> 00:05:36.711 position:50% align:center
We don't have a snowball's
chance right now.

00:05:36.795 --> 00:05:39.381 position:50% align:center

Take shelter at once!

[gasps]

00:05:43.927 --> 00:05:47.138 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA] How the hell are
we gonna get away from that?

00:05:50.225 --> 00:05:54.187 position:50% align:center
Watch me. You'll see!
I'm gonna do it!

00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:57.565 position:50% align:center
No, don't!

00:05:57.649 --> 00:06:01.611 position:50% align:center
No way! I can do this!
Because I have the power!

00:06:01.695 --> 00:06:04.155 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna blow this city away!

00:06:04.239 --> 00:06:05.824 position:50% align:center
No one can stop me!

00:06:05.907 --> 00:06:08.368 position:50% align:center

I am a protector!

Charon!

00:06:22.924 --> 00:06:28.972 position:50% align:center
All the Pillars, they...
they must be protected.

No matter what the cost may be!

00:06:31.933 --> 00:06:33.393 position:50% align:center
No way.

[HAUMEA]
Whoa.

00:06:53.204 --> 00:06:57.500 position:50% align:center
That's wild. Yeah,
maybe I went too far.

00:06:57.584 --> 00:06:59.085 position:50% align:center
Although...

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:01.588 position:50% align:center
...Pillars and their protectors
are all about teamwork, amirite?

00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:05.467 position:50% align:center
Good luck cleanin' up
my mess, Charon. Peace!

00:07:16.936 --> 00:07:18.438 position:50% align:center
Please, Haumea.

00:07:18.521 --> 00:07:21.066 position:50% align:center
Would it hurt for you to listen
to me just this one time?

00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:24.361 position:50% align:center
I'm sick of all your whining!
Just shut up already!

00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:26.154 position:50% align:center
Charon, you know, man,

00:07:26.237 --> 00:07:30.241 position:50% align:center
I can see everything that goes
on in that big head of yours.

00:07:30.325 --> 00:07:34.788 position:50% align:center
So stop worrying about me
all the dang time, okay?

00:07:34.871 --> 00:07:37.707 position:50% align:center
Damn it all. This is ridiculous.

00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:41.169 position:50% align:center
My life is flashing before
my eyes and there she is.

00:07:41.252 --> 00:07:45.298 position:50% align:center
I can't help but take
my calling very seriously.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.427 position:50% align:center
[CHARON] That's why
I have no other choice!

00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:53.056 position:50% align:center
[CHARON]
I <i>will</i> protect the Pillars!

00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:55.475 position:50% align:center

[CHARON groaning]

00:08:34.222 --> 00:08:36.182 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:08:36.266 --> 00:08:38.768 position:50% align:center

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:49.863 position:50% align:center
You'll have to stop the
Sixth Pillar for me.

00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:55.285 position:50% align:center
That was close.

00:08:55.368 --> 00:08:58.371 position:50% align:center
That was way too close.

00:08:58.455 --> 00:09:00.582 position:50% align:center
We were seconds away

00:09:00.665 --> 00:09:02.751 position:50% align:center
from having all the weak
people in the city

00:09:02.834 --> 00:09:05.378 position:50% align:center
just wiped out at once.

00:09:05.462 --> 00:09:09.591 position:50% align:center
You... You almost
took them from me.

00:09:12.344 --> 00:09:13.720 position:50% align:center
[KURONO]
And after this,

00:09:13.803 --> 00:09:17.599 position:50% align:center
Haijima is going to owe
me one hell of a bonus.

00:09:17.682 --> 00:09:20.185 position:50% align:center
I can do it. I gotta!

00:09:20.268 --> 00:09:22.854 position:50% align:center
Give me a chance, Kurono!

00:09:34.407 --> 00:09:35.450 position:50% align:center
Oh, whoa.

00:09:35.533 --> 00:09:37.285 position:50% align:center
He cut through my Flaming One.

00:09:37.369 --> 00:09:40.205 position:50% align:center
It's not demon-class, but that
armor is still insanely tough!

00:09:40.288 --> 00:09:41.206 position:50% align:center
I know.

00:09:41.289 --> 00:09:44.167 position:50% align:center
[gasps] My arm!

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:55.261 position:50% align:center
Don't get stronger. Hear me?

00:09:55.345 --> 00:09:59.766 position:50% align:center
I'm disappointed in you.
You're just hopeless.

00:09:59.849 --> 00:10:01.976 position:50% align:center
[NATAKU] Please don't
say things like that!

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:04.604 position:50% align:center
I'll do it, I promise!

00:10:04.688 --> 00:10:06.731 position:50% align:center
I know that I can
beat you, Kurono!

00:10:06.815 --> 00:10:09.567 position:50% align:center
And it's gonna be
super easy for me!

00:10:23.665 --> 00:10:27.752 position:50% align:center
You can do it, right, son?
I know you'd never let me down.

00:10:27.836 --> 00:10:29.963 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I can! Just watch me, Mom!

00:10:30.046 --> 00:10:31.297 position:50% align:center
[NATAKU'S MOTHER]
Oh, no.

00:10:31.381 --> 00:10:34.259 position:50% align:center
Everything'll be okay, Mom!
So please don't cry!

00:10:34.342 --> 00:10:37.595 position:50% align:center
I know can handle it! I have to!

00:10:43.518 --> 00:10:44.853 position:50% align:center
[REKKA]
You can do it!

00:10:44.936 --> 00:10:45.895 position:50% align:center
Yes, I can.

[REKKA]
You can do it! Get...

00:10:47.188 --> 00:10:51.192 position:50% align:center
I got this. I can.

00:10:51.276 --> 00:10:53.445 position:50% align:center

I have to do it!

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:04.873 position:50% align:center
I just have to! I owe it to Mom!

00:11:04.956 --> 00:11:07.125 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna do it!

00:11:09.794 --> 00:11:11.588 position:50% align:center
Kurono, stop!

00:11:18.136 --> 00:11:20.305 position:50% align:center
Let me go, Kurono!

00:11:20.388 --> 00:11:24.517 position:50% align:center
This isn't all I've got
in me! I can do better!

00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:26.102 position:50% align:center
I'm stronger!

00:11:26.186 --> 00:11:29.522 position:50% align:center
Everybody's expecting something
from me! I can't let them down.

00:11:29.606 --> 00:11:31.066 position:50% align:center
I can do it, okay?!

00:11:31.149 --> 00:11:31.858 position:50% align:center
Not now.

00:11:31.941 --> 00:11:32.901 position:50% align:center
[NATAKU]
But why?

00:11:32.984 --> 00:11:34.069 position:50% align:center
You and everyone else want me

00:11:34.152 --> 00:11:36.571 position:50% align:center
to use my Adolla Burst
thing, don't you?

00:11:36.654 --> 00:11:39.824 position:50% align:center
So just let me!
I won't fail you! I swear!

00:11:39.908 --> 00:11:42.243 position:50% align:center
I can do more!

00:11:42.327 --> 00:11:43.328 position:50% align:center
You've done enough.

00:11:43.411 --> 00:11:44.788 position:50% align:center
But that's what you want!

00:11:44.871 --> 00:11:48.792 position:50% align:center
Don't get stronger.
That's all I want.

00:11:51.836 --> 00:11:56.341 position:50% align:center
[NATAKU]
What? Why are you saying that?

00:11:56.424 --> 00:11:59.552 position:50% align:center
[KURONO] Because I like
to bully the weak.

00:11:59.636 --> 00:12:01.846 position:50% align:center
You're still just
a kid, aren't you?

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:04.891 position:50% align:center
You don't need to be stronger.

00:12:04.974 --> 00:12:08.353 position:50% align:center
[NATAKU] Are you saying you
don't expect anything from me?

00:12:08.436 --> 00:12:11.856 position:50% align:center
"I wanna do this."
"I wanna be that."

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:13.650 position:50% align:center
"I'm gonna become whatever".

00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:15.026 position:50% align:center
That kind of thinking

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:18.279 position:50% align:center
makes little brats get
stronger too soon.

00:12:18.363 --> 00:12:20.532 position:50% align:center
What's the big rush, anyway?

00:12:20.615 --> 00:12:23.910 position:50% align:center
I think you should hang on to
that weakness and vulnerability.

00:12:23.993 --> 00:12:27.455 position:50% align:center
The very thing that makes
me wanna bully you.

00:12:27.539 --> 00:12:29.290 position:50% align:center
It's such a fleeting thing,

00:12:29.374 --> 00:12:32.335 position:50% align:center
which is why it's
rare and precious.

00:12:33.336 --> 00:12:37.549 position:50% align:center
What I want is for you to
stay as weak as you are now.

00:12:38.466 --> 00:12:43.722 position:50% align:center
I can't believe it. I've never
heard anything like that.

00:12:43.805 --> 00:12:47.058 position:50% align:center
Mom and Dad always expected
so much out of me.

00:12:47.142 --> 00:12:50.228 position:50% align:center
They always said,
"You can do it, right?"

00:12:50.311 --> 00:12:51.438 position:50% align:center
But when I couldn't
do something,

00:12:51.521 --> 00:12:53.565 position:50% align:center
they would be so disappointed.

00:12:53.648 --> 00:12:56.234 position:50% align:center
It made me feel terrible.

00:12:57.736 --> 00:13:00.405 position:50% align:center
[NATAKU] I was so scared
of letting them down.

00:13:00.488 --> 00:13:04.367 position:50% align:center
Now this crazy man in my head
won't leave me alone.

00:13:04.451 --> 00:13:07.537 position:50% align:center
You're still just
a weak little kid.

00:13:11.666 --> 00:13:15.587 position:50% align:center
Tell me, is it okay
for me to be weak?

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:20.633 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I'd like you to be weak
enough for me to pick on.

00:13:23.011 --> 00:13:25.555 position:50% align:center
[NATAKU]
Thank you so much.

00:13:28.183 --> 00:13:29.976 position:50% align:center
[KURONO]
Hmph.

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:33.146 position:50% align:center
The radiation levels
are finally dropping.

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:36.358 position:50% align:center
Kurono stopped him.

00:13:36.441 --> 00:13:38.109 position:50% align:center
Ninety-nine percent
of people out there

00:13:38.193 --> 00:13:42.030 position:50% align:center
would take one look at this and
say it's a weird relationship.

00:13:42.113 --> 00:13:43.865 position:50% align:center
But for those of us
in the minority,

00:13:43.948 --> 00:13:46.826 position:50% align:center
this is the best thing
that could happen.

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:49.245 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:13:49.329 --> 00:13:53.583 position:50% align:center
Seems to me that we've found
the Sixth Pillar's protector.

00:13:54.501 --> 00:13:56.252 position:50% align:center
I'm completely exhausted.

00:13:56.336 --> 00:13:58.171 position:50% align:center
Let's leave the
kid with Haijima.

00:13:58.254 --> 00:14:00.465 position:50% align:center
At least, for the time being.

00:14:02.676 --> 00:14:06.513 position:50% align:center
[INCA]
You can stay right here for now.

00:14:06.596 --> 00:14:11.226 position:50% align:center
Because after all...
I can see your future.

00:14:11.309 --> 00:14:13.019 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:14:15.021 --> 00:14:16.314 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA gasps]

00:14:20.443 --> 00:14:22.362 position:50% align:center
They just left?

00:14:34.582 --> 00:14:35.792 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
The battle that day,

00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:38.670 position:50% align:center
between the 8th, Haijima,
and the White-Clad,

00:14:38.753 --> 00:14:41.506 position:50% align:center
was over for now.

00:14:41.589 --> 00:14:44.050 position:50% align:center
Thirty-two people
lost their lives.

00:14:44.134 --> 00:14:45.844 position:50% align:center
The official statement
to the public said

00:14:45.927 --> 00:14:50.181 position:50% align:center
that an accident occurred during
an Adolla Burst experiment.

00:14:50.265 --> 00:14:53.143 position:50% align:center
It ended up leaving a
huge crater on the moon.

00:14:53.226 --> 00:14:54.769 position:50% align:center
But since the people of
Earth had already dealt

00:14:54.853 --> 00:14:57.605 position:50% align:center
with the catastrophic damage
of the Great Cataclysm,

00:14:57.689 --> 00:15:00.859 position:50% align:center
nobody made that big
of a fuss about it.

00:15:00.942 --> 00:15:04.112 position:50% align:center
There are still kids being held
at the Haijima laboratory.

00:15:04.195 --> 00:15:06.573 position:50% align:center
All Company 8 could really
do was urge Haijima

00:15:06.656 --> 00:15:08.616 position:50% align:center
to stop their
extreme experiments

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:11.745 position:50% align:center
and quit trying to
create Adolla Bursts.

00:15:11.828 --> 00:15:14.873 position:50% align:center
I was surprised it was Kurono
who stopped Nataku.

00:15:14.956 --> 00:15:19.252 position:50% align:center
Basically, all I did was stand
around and watch it happen.

00:15:19.336 --> 00:15:21.296 position:50% align:center
That guy is super messed up,

00:15:21.379 --> 00:15:23.214 position:50% align:center
but somehow, he seems
to be a good partner

00:15:23.298 --> 00:15:26.092 position:50% align:center
for keeping Nataku
balanced, mentally.

00:15:26.176 --> 00:15:27.969 position:50% align:center
This investigation
was to find a link

00:15:28.053 --> 00:15:29.929 position:50% align:center
between Haijima
and the Evangelist,

00:15:30.013 --> 00:15:31.639 position:50% align:center
but seeing how this
all played out,

00:15:31.723 --> 00:15:34.225 position:50% align:center
it doesn't look
like there is one.

00:15:34.309 --> 00:15:38.396 position:50% align:center
And now, today, Inspector
Licht, Captain Obi, and I

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.565 position:50% align:center
were all summoned to Haijima

00:15:40.648 --> 00:15:44.402 position:50% align:center
to have a discussion
about what went down.

00:15:44.486 --> 00:15:45.987 position:50% align:center
Come in.

00:15:49.074 --> 00:15:53.370 position:50% align:center
[OBI] President Haijima,
thank you for bringing us here.

00:15:55.038 --> 00:15:59.334 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA] Regarding the recent
incident, I have this to say...

00:15:59.417 --> 00:16:02.545 position:50% align:center
...you have really
stepped in it this time.

00:16:04.964 --> 00:16:07.008 position:50% align:center
Do you expect to
survive in the Empire

00:16:07.092 --> 00:16:09.511 position:50% align:center
after making an
enemy of Haijima?

00:16:09.594 --> 00:16:11.304 position:50% align:center
Is that some kind of threat?

00:16:11.388 --> 00:16:13.264 position:50% align:center
I would consider
continuing our battle

00:16:13.348 --> 00:16:15.892 position:50% align:center
as a waste of time
and resources.

00:16:15.975 --> 00:16:18.561 position:50% align:center
Instead, I think it'd be
best to form an alliance

00:16:18.645 --> 00:16:20.397 position:50% align:center
against the Evangelist.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.273 position:50% align:center
If you would agree
to work with Haijima

00:16:22.357 --> 00:16:23.983 position:50% align:center
against our common enemy,

00:16:24.067 --> 00:16:26.403 position:50% align:center
I'd be willing to rescind
the execution order

00:16:26.486 --> 00:16:28.780 position:50% align:center
that's been placed
on Inspector Licht.

00:16:28.863 --> 00:16:30.949 position:50% align:center
Tell me what's gonna
happen to Nataku.

00:16:31.032 --> 00:16:32.867 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA] You're the crewman
with the Adolla Burst,

00:16:32.951 --> 00:16:34.202 position:50% align:center
are you not?

00:16:34.285 --> 00:16:35.912 position:50% align:center
Agree to aid us in our research

00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:37.747 position:50% align:center
and I'll make this
pledge to you.

00:16:37.831 --> 00:16:42.252 position:50% align:center
The experiments we do in the
children's facility will change.

00:16:42.335 --> 00:16:44.045 position:50% align:center
I think this is a
fair deal as it is,

00:16:44.129 --> 00:16:45.964 position:50% align:center
but I'll go a step further.

00:16:46.047 --> 00:16:48.758 position:50% align:center
How about I drop all the charges
against you and Licht?

00:16:48.842 --> 00:16:50.260 position:50% align:center
Have you forgotten
that you were the one

00:16:50.343 --> 00:16:51.928 position:50% align:center
who started this
whole fight, sir?

00:16:52.012 --> 00:16:54.305 position:50% align:center
Don't let your emotions
get the best of you.

00:16:54.389 --> 00:16:56.683 position:50% align:center
We're discussing matters
of great importance.

00:16:56.766 --> 00:17:00.437 position:50% align:center
Ones that will affect the
very future of the Empire.

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:03.940 position:50% align:center
[OBI] I assume you must know
the function of Company 8.

00:17:04.024 --> 00:17:05.984 position:50% align:center
We carry out internal
investigations

00:17:06.067 --> 00:17:09.612 position:50% align:center
into matters concerning
the Special Fire Force.

00:17:09.696 --> 00:17:12.323 position:50% align:center
We suspect that Haijima
is somehow connected

00:17:12.407 --> 00:17:13.533 position:50% align:center
to the Evangelist.

00:17:13.616 --> 00:17:16.244 position:50% align:center
You're hiding something
about Amaterasu.

00:17:16.327 --> 00:17:18.038 position:50% align:center
We have learned that
there were non-humans

00:17:18.121 --> 00:17:21.124 position:50% align:center
involved in the founding
of the Holy Sol Temple.

00:17:21.207 --> 00:17:23.960 position:50% align:center
And since these beings were
tied to the Evangelist,

00:17:24.044 --> 00:17:25.545 position:50% align:center
then it would come
as no surprise

00:17:25.628 --> 00:17:28.631 position:50% align:center
that Haijima shared these ties.

00:17:28.715 --> 00:17:30.342 position:50% align:center
The Holy Sol Temple
worked together

00:17:30.425 --> 00:17:32.594 position:50% align:center
with Haijima to build Amaterasu.

00:17:32.677 --> 00:17:36.056 position:50% align:center
You're saying Haijima <i>does</i> have
a connection to the Evangelist?

00:17:36.139 --> 00:17:39.809 position:50% align:center
So were you aware there was
a person inside Amaterasu?

00:17:39.893 --> 00:17:41.311 position:50% align:center
Yes, of course.

00:17:41.394 --> 00:17:44.606 position:50% align:center
After all, Amaterasu is
powered by a human being

00:17:44.689 --> 00:17:47.442 position:50% align:center
that possesses an Adolla Burst.

00:17:49.611 --> 00:17:52.197 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
But so what if it does?

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.991 position:50% align:center
Just shutting it down
is not an option.

00:17:55.075 --> 00:17:57.118 position:50% align:center
The entire Tokyo Empire
has been built

00:17:57.202 --> 00:17:59.746 position:50% align:center
upon the sacrifice
made by one person.

00:17:59.829 --> 00:18:02.165 position:50% align:center
If we chose to cease
its operation,

00:18:02.248 --> 00:18:06.002 position:50% align:center
then what would become of our
countrymen who depend on it?

00:18:06.086 --> 00:18:08.880 position:50% align:center
If their energy source were
to suddenly vanish,

00:18:08.963 --> 00:18:12.008 position:50% align:center
surely rampant chaos
would ensue.

00:18:12.092 --> 00:18:15.470 position:50% align:center
The Evangelist's adherents
just attacked our facility.

00:18:15.553 --> 00:18:17.722 position:50% align:center
Does this incident not
disprove your theory

00:18:17.806 --> 00:18:20.266 position:50% align:center
that we're somehow
in league with them?

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:23.770 position:50% align:center
Haijima has a great deal
of influence over Company 3.

00:18:23.853 --> 00:18:27.315 position:50% align:center
Dr. Giovanni has proven
ties with the Evangelist.

00:18:27.399 --> 00:18:30.193 position:50% align:center
The matter with the 3rd
is extremely unfortunate.

00:18:30.276 --> 00:18:31.778 position:50% align:center
But remember that 70% percent

00:18:31.861 --> 00:18:35.657 position:50% align:center
of the Empire's population
works for Haijima.

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:39.577 position:50% align:center
It would be an impossible feat
to keep track of all of them.

00:18:39.661 --> 00:18:41.996 position:50% align:center
The Evangelist is attempting
to monopolize control

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:43.456 position:50% align:center
over Adolla Bursts.

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:45.417 position:50% align:center
That is becoming
a nuisance for us.

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:46.751 position:50% align:center
You'd be wise to destroy them

00:18:46.835 --> 00:18:49.921 position:50% align:center
and stop this Haijima
witch hunt.

00:18:50.005 --> 00:18:51.923 position:50% align:center
[OBI grunts]

00:18:52.007 --> 00:18:56.094 position:50% align:center
Wanna tell us why Haijima
wants an Adolla Burst so badly?

00:18:56.177 --> 00:18:59.806 position:50% align:center
It's in order to power
a second Amaterasu.

00:19:01.182 --> 00:19:03.184 position:50% align:center
Do you not value human lives?

00:19:03.268 --> 00:19:06.021 position:50% align:center
Having an Adolla Burst doesn't
make you less of a person!

00:19:06.104 --> 00:19:07.439 position:50% align:center
But it does make it possible

00:19:07.522 --> 00:19:10.150 position:50% align:center
to save 15 million
of your fellow men.

00:19:10.233 --> 00:19:15.071 position:50% align:center
Amaterasu is what keeps this
entire Empire from collapse.

00:19:15.155 --> 00:19:18.491 position:50% align:center
I'll ask you as one
possessing an Adolla Burst.

00:19:18.575 --> 00:19:21.619 position:50% align:center
If you could give your life in
order to save 15 million others,

00:19:21.703 --> 00:19:24.372 position:50% align:center
would you not make
that sacrifice?

00:19:24.456 --> 00:19:26.041 position:50% align:center
Since you became a Fire Soldier,

00:19:26.124 --> 00:19:28.126 position:50% align:center
it would seem you've
already made the decision

00:19:28.209 --> 00:19:30.378 position:50% align:center
to pay the ultimate
price to save another.

00:19:30.462 --> 00:19:32.422 position:50% align:center
I would proudly
lay down my life!

00:19:32.505 --> 00:19:34.299 position:50% align:center
If the sacrifice
of one Fire Soldier

00:19:34.382 --> 00:19:35.633 position:50% align:center
was all it took to save everyo--

00:19:35.717 --> 00:19:37.886 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
No, Shinra.

00:19:37.969 --> 00:19:40.388 position:50% align:center
Fire Soldiers'
lives are valuable.

00:19:40.472 --> 00:19:43.016 position:50% align:center
I mean, you can't really expect
to save anybody's life

00:19:43.099 --> 00:19:44.392 position:50% align:center
if you're dead.

00:19:44.476 --> 00:19:46.811 position:50% align:center
Matter of fact,
you might be able to save

00:19:46.895 --> 00:19:50.190 position:50% align:center
more than 15 million
people if you keep at it.

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:54.694 position:50% align:center
There is another way! I'm gonna
build my own generator!

00:19:54.778 --> 00:19:57.322 position:50% align:center
One better than Amaterasu,
and no one has to die!

00:19:57.405 --> 00:19:59.699 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA GUARD A]
Hey. Hold it, pal!

00:19:59.783 --> 00:20:01.659 position:50% align:center
Now don't you worry, Shinra!

00:20:01.743 --> 00:20:04.120 position:50% align:center
There's no way I'm gonna let you
be sacrificed by these ghouls!

00:20:04.204 --> 00:20:05.663 position:50% align:center
Vulcan.

00:20:05.747 --> 00:20:08.583 position:50% align:center
A member of the Joseph family
that built Amaterasu.

00:20:08.667 --> 00:20:12.253 position:50% align:center
That so? All right. Let him in.

00:20:12.337 --> 00:20:13.922 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
Hands off!

00:20:17.133 --> 00:20:19.386 position:50% align:center
So you're the top dog
around here, huh?

00:20:19.469 --> 00:20:21.096 position:50% align:center
You claim you can
build a generator

00:20:21.179 --> 00:20:24.474 position:50% align:center
superior to Amaterasu
that requires no sacrifice?

00:20:24.557 --> 00:20:27.560 position:50% align:center
Yeah. All I want is to bring
the world back to life.

00:20:27.644 --> 00:20:30.939 position:50% align:center
And we're gonna need way more
than Amaterasu to do that.

00:20:31.022 --> 00:20:34.150 position:50% align:center
We're not sacrificing
Shinra, no matter what.

00:20:34.234 --> 00:20:37.153 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna protect him
if it's the last thing I do.

00:20:37.237 --> 00:20:40.281 position:50% align:center
Thank you, guys. Really.

00:20:41.449 --> 00:20:43.952 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Charon did say that the Pillars

00:20:44.035 --> 00:20:46.413 position:50% align:center
all had their protectors.

00:20:46.496 --> 00:20:50.875 position:50% align:center
And it looks like mine...
is everybody at the 8th.

00:20:50.959 --> 00:20:53.044 position:50% align:center
That's quite a bold claim.

00:20:53.128 --> 00:20:54.713 position:50% align:center
If you can make
good on your plan,

00:20:54.796 --> 00:20:58.550 position:50% align:center
that would be a dream come
true for Haijima, as well.

00:20:59.718 --> 00:21:03.263 position:50% align:center
We'll back you 100%.
That also goes for the 8th.

00:21:03.346 --> 00:21:04.723 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:05.849 --> 00:21:09.227 position:50% align:center
Tell me this,
you sure you can do it?

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:12.022 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Hell yeah, sir!

00:21:12.105 --> 00:21:14.024 position:50% align:center
There's only one condition.

00:21:14.107 --> 00:21:17.569 position:50% align:center
We'll have rights equal to the
proportion of our investment.

00:21:17.652 --> 00:21:19.112 position:50% align:center
Just give me the
materials I need

00:21:19.195 --> 00:21:21.114 position:50% align:center
and you can own the whole thing.

00:21:21.197 --> 00:21:24.200 position:50% align:center
I'm savin' the world,
not cashin' in.

00:21:26.077 --> 00:21:27.829 position:50% align:center
[HAIJIMA]
It's settled, then.

00:21:27.912 --> 00:21:31.458 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Haijima might only be
motivated by turning a profit,

00:21:31.541 --> 00:21:35.086 position:50% align:center
but I don't think they have any
connection to the Evangelist,

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:38.340 position:50% align:center
so I guess we're gonna
be workin' with them.

00:21:38.423 --> 00:21:40.759 position:50% align:center
So what's goin' on with Nataku?

00:21:40.842 --> 00:21:42.302 position:50% align:center
He's just fine.

00:21:42.385 --> 00:21:45.889 position:50% align:center
He's taking part in another
Adolla Burst experiment today.

00:21:45.972 --> 00:21:47.432 position:50% align:center
You mean you're
still torturing him?

00:21:47.515 --> 00:21:49.517 position:50% align:center
We're taking great
care with the boy.

00:21:49.601 --> 00:21:51.686 position:50% align:center
There's no need to worry.

00:21:54.064 --> 00:21:55.065 position:50% align:center
[RESEARCHER A]
You've learned how to control

00:21:55.148 --> 00:21:57.150 position:50% align:center
your flame pretty well, huh?

00:21:57.233 --> 00:22:01.321 position:50% align:center
No, uh... I'm still scared
without my fireproof cloak.

00:22:01.404 --> 00:22:04.407 position:50% align:center
[RESEARCHER A] Well, that's
all right. You can do this.

00:22:04.491 --> 00:22:06.659 position:50% align:center
--Yes, I can.
--[REKKA] Yes, you can.

00:22:09.913 --> 00:22:11.664 position:50% align:center
[KURONO] All right,
are you ready to play

00:22:11.748 --> 00:22:14.459 position:50% align:center
with your Uncle
Reaper again today?

00:22:15.377 --> 00:22:16.920 position:50% align:center
I am.

00:22:17.003 --> 00:22:18.880 position:50% align:center
Just try to relax.

00:22:18.963 --> 00:22:22.384 position:50% align:center
Stay nice and weak
for me. Please.

00:22:22.467 --> 00:22:23.802 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:22:27.931 --> 00:22:29.391 position:50% align:center
[NATAKU]
Yes, sir!

00:24:10.533 --> 00:24:13.203 position:50% align:center
[IRIS] The Holy Sol Temple has
provided salvation to those

00:24:13.286 --> 00:24:15.413 position:50% align:center
who fear the terror
of the flame.

00:24:15.497 --> 00:24:17.248 position:50% align:center
But something bothers me.

00:24:17.332 --> 00:24:21.836 position:50% align:center
Great Sol, has my faith and
devotion to you been a mistake?

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:24.464 position:50% align:center
Will you pray with me?

00:24:24.547 --> 00:24:26.299 position:50% align:center
Next time on <i>Fire Force</i> ,

00:24:26.383 --> 00:24:30.762 position:50% align:center
Season Two, Episode Eighteen:
"The Holy Woman's Anguish."

00:24:30.845 --> 00:24:34.015 position:50% align:center
Return to the great
flame of fire. <i>Látom</i> .
