00:00:20.395 --> 00:00:22.480 position:50% align:center
Get out of me right now!

00:00:22.564 --> 00:00:24.149 position:50% align:center
What a letdown.

00:00:24.232 --> 00:00:26.901 position:50% align:center
I guess that was all the
killer instinct you had.

00:00:26.985 --> 00:00:29.696 position:50% align:center
At least I had more fun
than I thought I would.

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:31.156 position:50% align:center
Wait a sec!

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:34.284 position:50% align:center
Earlier, you told me that you
knew how to find my mom.

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:35.702 position:50% align:center
Is that true?

00:00:35.785 --> 00:00:39.414 position:50% align:center
Is she still somewhere out
there, or were you lying?

00:00:39.497 --> 00:00:41.791 position:50% align:center
[FIRST PILLAR chuckles]

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:43.376 position:50% align:center
That's a good question.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.463 position:50% align:center
But seeing as you just rejected
me, I don't feel like answering.

00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:48.256 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Come back!

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:49.507 position:50% align:center
[FIRST PILLAR]
Oh, by the way.

00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:52.218 position:50% align:center
We've had Haumea, Sho, you,

00:00:52.302 --> 00:00:55.347 position:50% align:center
and now, it looks like a new
Pillar is about to be born.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.265 position:50% align:center
I think I'll go play
with them now.

00:00:57.349 --> 00:01:00.727 position:50% align:center
A new Pillar? You mean
someone with an Adolla Burst?

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:01.853 position:50% align:center
[FIRST PILLAR]
If I'm able to sense

00:01:01.936 --> 00:01:03.063 position:50% align:center
that a new Pillar is coming,

00:01:03.146 --> 00:01:05.690 position:50% align:center
you can bet that the
Evangelist knows, too.

00:01:05.774 --> 00:01:08.318 position:50% align:center
The Fire Force
or the White-Clad,

00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:10.570 position:50% align:center
which one of you will
reach it first?

00:01:10.653 --> 00:01:11.905 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:01:11.988 --> 00:01:14.115 position:50% align:center
Just who the hell are you?

00:01:15.408 --> 00:01:17.535 position:50% align:center
[FIRST PILLAR] Someone who's
been watching this Empire

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:19.621 position:50% align:center
for a long time!

00:01:22.832 --> 00:01:24.793 position:50% align:center
[ASAKO]
Pupil response is normal.

00:01:24.876 --> 00:01:26.920 position:50% align:center
And you seem to be lucid now.

00:01:27.003 --> 00:01:29.089 position:50% align:center
They're gonna be perfectly fine.

00:01:29.172 --> 00:01:31.424 position:50% align:center
[KARIN]
Did something happen to us?

00:01:31.508 --> 00:01:33.885 position:50% align:center
I don't remember anything.

00:01:33.968 --> 00:01:37.847 position:50% align:center
Apparently, someone took both
your bodies for a joyride.

00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:40.225 position:50% align:center
[OGUN] Ya think it was the same
person who possessed Shinra?

00:01:40.308 --> 00:01:42.769 position:50% align:center
I don't. They had
a different energy.

00:01:42.852 --> 00:01:45.563 position:50% align:center
Your guys were possessed
by that electric girl.

00:01:46.648 --> 00:01:49.442 position:50% align:center
[HAUMEA] It looks like
the First Pillar took off,

00:01:49.526 --> 00:01:52.487 position:50% align:center
so I went ahead and released
the guys from the 4th.

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.406 position:50% align:center
[HAUMEA laughs]

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:56.074 position:50% align:center
[HAUMEA]
I'm glad we came out here.

00:01:56.157 --> 00:01:58.410 position:50% align:center
The First Pillar said
something interesting.

00:01:58.493 --> 00:01:59.869 position:50% align:center
You'll tell me what, right?

00:01:59.953 --> 00:02:01.538 position:50% align:center
She said she could
sense the coming birth

00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:03.164 position:50% align:center
of the world's fifth
Adolla Burster.

00:02:03.248 --> 00:02:05.875 position:50% align:center
Huh? The Fifth Pillar
is coming? Soon?

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:07.627 position:50% align:center
You're kidding.
Is this for real?

00:02:07.711 --> 00:02:08.920 position:50% align:center
And what does it mean
for us, should--?

00:02:09.004 --> 00:02:10.171 position:50% align:center
[HAUMEA]
Shut up!

00:02:10.255 --> 00:02:11.756 position:50% align:center
And get ready.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.260 position:50% align:center
We're about to scramble against
those Fire Force punks.

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:51.314 position:50% align:center
So the angel told you
that another wielder

00:03:51.398 --> 00:03:53.566 position:50% align:center
of the Adolla Burst
is about to be born?

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.362 position:50% align:center
And she warned you that the
Evangelist is aware of this.

00:03:57.445 --> 00:03:58.905 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Yes, sir.

00:03:58.988 --> 00:04:01.741 position:50% align:center
I don't know if this is true,
but from what they've said,

00:04:01.825 --> 00:04:04.661 position:50% align:center
the White-Clad want to
collect every Adolla Burst.

00:04:04.744 --> 00:04:08.164 position:50% align:center
And then use us to trigger a
repeat of the Great Cataclysm.

00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:10.000 position:50% align:center
We would have to be
fools to take the word

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:11.876 position:50% align:center
of our enemy at face value,

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.047 position:50% align:center
but it would be equally foolish
to disregard them entirely.

00:04:17.173 --> 00:04:19.342 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] I'm truly sorry
about my conduct, sir.

00:04:19.426 --> 00:04:21.636 position:50% align:center
I promise to submit
a written apology.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.515 position:50% align:center
That's all right. Why don't we
sweep this one under the rug?

00:04:25.598 --> 00:04:26.933 position:50% align:center
No one died,

00:04:27.017 --> 00:04:30.812 position:50% align:center
and your flames helped me
steal a glimpse of Adolla.

00:04:30.895 --> 00:04:32.856 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] I have one more
question, about Adolla.

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:34.357 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:04:34.441 --> 00:04:37.569 position:50% align:center
Why do you think you
saw it the first time?

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.450 position:50% align:center
In the red storm of the Great
Fire, I came close to the truth.

00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:45.827 position:50% align:center
I think that's why.

00:04:50.665 --> 00:04:53.126 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Thanks for
helping me, Lieutenant.

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:55.045 position:50% align:center
[ASAKO]
I was happy to assist.

00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:57.088 position:50% align:center
Sorry about all the trouble.

00:04:57.172 --> 00:05:00.008 position:50% align:center
Oh. I'm just glad that
everybody's okay now.

00:05:00.091 --> 00:05:03.636 position:50% align:center
Anyway, best of luck with your
mission. The 6th is with you!

00:05:08.558 --> 00:05:10.310 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] That psycho girl
used an Adolla Link

00:05:10.393 --> 00:05:11.978 position:50% align:center
to screw with my head.

00:05:12.062 --> 00:05:16.566 position:50% align:center
I have no reason to trust her,
but if she did tell the truth,

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:18.485 position:50% align:center
then the Fifth Pillar is coming,

00:05:18.568 --> 00:05:21.488 position:50% align:center
and we have to protect them
from the Evangelist.

00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:23.448 position:50% align:center
Can't believe you
let that happen.

00:05:23.531 --> 00:05:26.659 position:50% align:center
You're lucky I was around
to smack you out of it.

00:05:30.121 --> 00:05:33.583 position:50% align:center
Yeah. This one was
on me. Sorry, Arthur.

00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:34.417 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:35.960 position:50% align:center
What the--?!

00:05:36.044 --> 00:05:37.921 position:50% align:center
The real Shinra isn't
half this agreeable.

00:05:38.004 --> 00:05:40.632 position:50% align:center
Huh? What do you mean?
I'm a nice guy!

00:05:40.715 --> 00:05:43.551 position:50% align:center
When I'm not dealing with
jerks like you, at least.

00:05:46.096 --> 00:05:47.347 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
Hmph.

00:05:50.934 --> 00:05:54.062 position:50% align:center
We aren't gonna find the truth
just by thinking about it.

00:05:54.145 --> 00:05:55.522 position:50% align:center
We need to act.

00:05:55.605 --> 00:05:57.440 position:50% align:center
For me, that means
saving my family

00:05:57.524 --> 00:06:00.026 position:50% align:center
and protecting
this Fifth Pillar.

00:06:02.237 --> 00:06:05.073 position:50% align:center
Because that's my
duty as a hero.

00:06:06.116 --> 00:06:07.742 position:50% align:center
[OBI] Now that we know
what the Evangelist

00:06:07.826 --> 00:06:09.119 position:50% align:center
and White-Clad are after,

00:06:09.202 --> 00:06:10.912 position:50% align:center
we should bring all
the companies together

00:06:10.995 --> 00:06:12.914 position:50% align:center
and take 'em out.

00:06:12.997 --> 00:06:15.333 position:50% align:center
Listen, I've already talked
to the other companies,

00:06:15.417 --> 00:06:18.920 position:50% align:center
and most have your White-Clad
on the backburner right now.

00:06:22.007 --> 00:06:25.301 position:50% align:center
That isn't all. Another Adolla
Burst might be born soon.

00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:26.761 position:50% align:center
We need to secure it.

00:06:26.845 --> 00:06:29.681 position:50% align:center
It's not easy to get
people to buy all this.

00:06:29.764 --> 00:06:31.516 position:50% align:center
Our friends at
Haijima Industries

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:33.893 position:50% align:center
have been especially
uncooperative.

00:06:33.977 --> 00:06:36.062 position:50% align:center
The White-Clad are turning
people into Infernals

00:06:36.146 --> 00:06:38.440 position:50% align:center
as we speak--they need
to be stopped.

00:06:38.523 --> 00:06:41.276 position:50% align:center
Everyone agrees that
this group is a problem,

00:06:41.359 --> 00:06:43.486 position:50% align:center
but the scope of the
threat isn't clear yet.

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.657 position:50% align:center
We aren't sure if they <i>can</i>
cause another Great Cataclysm.

00:06:47.741 --> 00:06:49.492 position:50% align:center
I can't mobilize all
eight companies

00:06:49.576 --> 00:06:51.244 position:50% align:center
unless you find hard evidence.

00:06:51.327 --> 00:06:52.704 position:50% align:center
That won't exist
till it's too late.

00:06:52.787 --> 00:06:54.581 position:50% align:center
You're absolutely right.

00:06:54.664 --> 00:06:58.501 position:50% align:center
And that's why I've given
you a company of your own.

00:06:58.585 --> 00:07:00.378 position:50% align:center
You're free to take the
8th where you please,

00:07:00.462 --> 00:07:02.255 position:50% align:center
same as you have been.

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:04.716 position:50% align:center
I'll deal with the consequences.

00:07:04.799 --> 00:07:06.676 position:50% align:center
So even though the stakes
couldn't be higher,

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.596 position:50% align:center
we still can't
expect more support.

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:12.474 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Understood, sir.

00:07:12.557 --> 00:07:15.810 position:50% align:center
The 8th will continue
to investigate alone.

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:18.688 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Thank you for your time.

00:07:18.772 --> 00:07:21.691 position:50% align:center
You're becoming a lot
more reasonable, Obi.

00:07:21.775 --> 00:07:24.736 position:50% align:center
Does this mean you're
finally growing up?

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:27.072 position:50% align:center
[OBI] I'm quicker to shut
up about my frustrations

00:07:27.155 --> 00:07:29.199 position:50% align:center
and shove my complaints aside.

00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:30.909 position:50% align:center
But that doesn't make
me more mature.

00:07:30.992 --> 00:07:32.994 position:50% align:center
Sure sounds like maturity to me.

00:07:33.078 --> 00:07:35.914 position:50% align:center
What the hell does
growing up mean to you?

00:07:35.997 --> 00:07:38.041 position:50% align:center
Caring more deeply and broadly.

00:07:38.124 --> 00:07:42.671 position:50% align:center
I will never give up on
protecting this world, sir.

00:07:42.754 --> 00:07:44.297 position:50% align:center
See ya later.

00:07:46.841 --> 00:07:49.302 position:50% align:center
Yeah, he would say that.

00:07:49.386 --> 00:07:52.305 position:50% align:center
Fact is, the man's right.

00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:55.100 position:50% align:center
We can't let this
carnage continue.

00:07:55.183 --> 00:07:59.187 position:50% align:center
We have to snuff out
this fire at the source.

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:01.022 position:50% align:center
[FRIEND A] You know that
senior who just moved in?

00:08:01.106 --> 00:08:02.232 position:50% align:center
[FRIEND B]
Uh-huh.

00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:03.942 position:50% align:center
He's like ugly,
but hot, ya know?

00:08:04.025 --> 00:08:06.778 position:50% align:center
Definitely not. Your
taste in guys is weird.

00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:08.154 position:50% align:center
[FRIEND A]
What? That's not true.

00:08:08.238 --> 00:08:09.531 position:50% align:center
[FRIEND B]
Girl, you dated a hobo.

00:08:09.614 --> 00:08:11.199 position:50% align:center
[FRIEND A] He wasn't
homeless. He had a car!

00:08:11.282 --> 00:08:12.075 position:50% align:center
[FRIEND B]
He smelled.

00:08:12.158 --> 00:08:15.078 position:50% align:center
Inca, care to weigh in?

00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:16.955 position:50% align:center
[FRIEND B]
Inca? You good?

00:08:17.038 --> 00:08:19.791 position:50% align:center
[INCA] Sorry, I left
something at school.

00:08:19.874 --> 00:08:21.334 position:50% align:center
Just go on without me!

00:08:21.418 --> 00:08:22.836 position:50% align:center
[FRIEND A]
Uh?

00:08:25.755 --> 00:08:28.466 position:50% align:center
[INCA]
Such a fragrant aroma.

00:08:34.055 --> 00:08:35.807 position:50% align:center
[INCA]
No doubt about it.

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.601 position:50% align:center
So what's the word?
Is it comin' soon?

00:08:38.685 --> 00:08:40.270 position:50% align:center
That'd be some welcome news.

00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:42.522 position:50% align:center
You two had better not
show up this late again.

00:08:42.605 --> 00:08:44.899 position:50% align:center
Sorry, boss. We'll be
quicker next time.

00:08:44.983 --> 00:08:48.862 position:50% align:center
Panda just had some trouble
getting his butt into gear.

00:08:48.945 --> 00:08:50.780 position:50% align:center
The smell is getting
stronger now.

00:08:50.864 --> 00:08:53.241 position:50% align:center
Panda, Sancho! We're on!

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:55.702 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:08:55.785 --> 00:08:58.038 position:50% align:center
If lady luck is with us,
it'll be a rich guy's house

00:08:58.121 --> 00:09:00.373 position:50% align:center
that catches fire this time.

00:09:06.796 --> 00:09:09.841 position:50% align:center
This is the place.
There should be an easy in.

00:09:09.924 --> 00:09:13.011 position:50% align:center
Heh. The flames should
start any second.

00:09:13.094 --> 00:09:14.929 position:50% align:center
Then let's get to it.

00:09:15.013 --> 00:09:16.473 position:50% align:center
[PANDA]
Yeah.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.726 position:50% align:center
[INCA]
Time to make some money.

00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:36.618 position:50% align:center
[OLD MAN A]
Hm?

00:09:36.701 --> 00:09:38.953 position:50% align:center
Is something burning?

00:09:39.037 --> 00:09:40.121 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:40.205 --> 00:09:43.333 position:50% align:center
Oh, no. It's a fire.
My house is on fire!

00:09:43.416 --> 00:09:45.377 position:50% align:center
[INCA]
It seems pretty bad down there.

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:47.462 position:50% align:center
I bet the floor could
give out any second.

00:09:47.545 --> 00:09:48.922 position:50% align:center
[OLD MAN A] Oh, thank
goodness you're here!

00:09:49.005 --> 00:09:50.674 position:50% align:center
Help me, please!

00:09:50.757 --> 00:09:53.843 position:50% align:center
[INCA] I'll get you out of
here safely, if you want.

00:09:53.927 --> 00:09:57.806 position:50% align:center
But only if you make it
worth my while. Understand?

00:09:57.889 --> 00:10:00.308 position:50% align:center
What are you talking about?
Everything I have is burning!

00:10:00.392 --> 00:10:03.019 position:50% align:center
[INCA] Yeah, so there isn't
much time to think on it.

00:10:03.103 --> 00:10:07.357 position:50% align:center
If you want my help, you'll
give me everything you've got.

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:11.820 position:50% align:center
Um. There's a pen tray inside
the bottom drawer in there.

00:10:11.903 --> 00:10:13.446 position:50% align:center
My money's right under it.

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:14.864 position:50% align:center
You can take whatever you want.

00:10:14.948 --> 00:10:18.034 position:50% align:center
I have a bum leg.
I won't make it alone!

00:10:19.703 --> 00:10:20.537 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.914 position:50% align:center
[INCA]
Nice.

00:10:22.997 --> 00:10:26.334 position:50% align:center
[PANDA] Whew. You're
one heavy old geezer.

00:10:26.418 --> 00:10:29.045 position:50% align:center
[OLD MAN A]
I'm okay. I'm okay.

00:10:29.129 --> 00:10:32.882 position:50% align:center
Welp. We're done here. Let's go.

00:10:32.966 --> 00:10:36.177 position:50% align:center
We'll split it 20, 20, 60. Cool?

00:10:36.261 --> 00:10:37.512 position:50% align:center
Wait, how is that fair?

00:10:37.595 --> 00:10:39.973 position:50% align:center
Because you couldn't have
done this without me.

00:10:40.056 --> 00:10:41.558 position:50% align:center
Yeah. She has a point.

00:10:41.641 --> 00:10:42.767 position:50% align:center
We can only do this

00:10:42.851 --> 00:10:44.769 position:50% align:center
'cause she knows where
the fires'll break out.

00:10:44.853 --> 00:10:46.896 position:50% align:center
I've been wondering:
How's that work?

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:48.565 position:50% align:center
Are you like a pyrokinetic?

00:10:48.648 --> 00:10:50.775 position:50% align:center
I didn't think there was a
generation that could guess

00:10:50.859 --> 00:10:52.360 position:50% align:center
where fires would break out.

00:10:52.444 --> 00:10:53.862 position:50% align:center
[INCA]
So there's first gens--

00:10:53.945 --> 00:10:56.322 position:50% align:center
they burst into flame
and become Infernals.

00:10:56.406 --> 00:10:59.701 position:50% align:center
Second gens can manipulate
and control existing flames.

00:10:59.784 --> 00:11:01.327 position:50% align:center
And then there's third gens--

00:11:01.411 --> 00:11:05.290 position:50% align:center
they can ignite their own flames
and adjust how they burn.

00:11:05.373 --> 00:11:08.835 position:50% align:center
But I don't have any
control over fire at all.

00:11:08.918 --> 00:11:10.587 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Which means.

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:13.923 position:50% align:center
It's possible that I'm the first
member of the fourth generation.

00:11:14.007 --> 00:11:16.509 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Oh, man, that'd be insane!

00:11:16.593 --> 00:11:21.598 position:50% align:center
So that fire two years back?
That burned up all those people?

00:11:21.681 --> 00:11:25.226 position:50% align:center
Not to mention all
their valuables...

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:28.146 position:50% align:center
Before that fire, I didn't
know why I'd been born,

00:11:28.229 --> 00:11:30.106 position:50% align:center
or what the point of living was.

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:34.027 position:50% align:center
I honestly hoped I would just
spontaneously combust one day.

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:36.988 position:50% align:center
Go out in a blaze of glory.

00:11:37.072 --> 00:11:41.659 position:50% align:center
Flames sprang up one by one
as if fueled by the newly dead.

00:11:41.743 --> 00:11:44.371 position:50% align:center
I'd never been in such
a hopeless situation,

00:11:44.454 --> 00:11:47.624 position:50% align:center
and it made me think,
for the first time,

00:11:47.707 --> 00:11:50.669 position:50% align:center
"I want to live."

00:11:50.752 --> 00:11:52.587 position:50% align:center
The terror and the
warmth of the flames

00:11:52.671 --> 00:11:55.298 position:50% align:center
engulfed my entire being.

00:11:57.133 --> 00:12:00.345 position:50% align:center
[INCA] It was exhilarating.
Like nothing I'd ever felt.

00:12:00.428 --> 00:12:03.306 position:50% align:center
[OTHERS yelp, scream]

00:12:04.933 --> 00:12:08.269 position:50% align:center
Guess I'd better leave.
Let's see, uh...

00:12:10.021 --> 00:12:12.357 position:50% align:center
Uh-oh. Hey. I wouldn't--

00:12:14.484 --> 00:12:16.319 position:50% align:center
Huh? Another?

00:12:18.321 --> 00:12:20.615 position:50% align:center
That's weird.

00:12:20.699 --> 00:12:24.494 position:50% align:center
I can tell where the flames
will flare up next.

00:12:24.577 --> 00:12:29.290 position:50% align:center
The scent becomes a
line that I can see.

00:12:29.374 --> 00:12:31.793 position:50% align:center
There. Oh, whoa.

00:12:31.876 --> 00:12:33.378 position:50% align:center
[INCA]
I get it.

00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:37.382 position:50% align:center
The flames appear wherever the
light is thickest and brightest.

00:12:37.465 --> 00:12:40.969 position:50% align:center
Now that I understand,
this is easy!

00:12:43.013 --> 00:12:45.890 position:50% align:center
[INCA] The Great Fire took
a lot of things on that day,

00:12:45.974 --> 00:12:49.310 position:50% align:center
but it also gave me
this amazing power.

00:12:49.394 --> 00:12:51.021 position:50% align:center
And then you decided
to use that power

00:12:51.104 --> 00:12:52.856 position:50% align:center
to take advantage
of the helpless.

00:12:52.939 --> 00:12:54.566 position:50% align:center
Think it's called
fireground robbery.

00:12:54.649 --> 00:12:56.651 position:50% align:center
Nothing's more precious
than life, right?

00:12:56.735 --> 00:12:58.153 position:50% align:center
If these people want
me to save them,

00:12:58.236 --> 00:13:00.655 position:50% align:center
then handing over their shinies
is the least they can do.

00:13:00.739 --> 00:13:03.533 position:50% align:center
Okay, but, it kinda seems like
you're doing this for the thrill

00:13:03.616 --> 00:13:04.826 position:50% align:center
more than the money.

00:13:04.909 --> 00:13:06.953 position:50% align:center
The Great Fire made
you feel alive.

00:13:07.037 --> 00:13:09.914 position:50% align:center
Gave you a rush, right? And you
wanna feel that rush again.

00:13:09.998 --> 00:13:12.292 position:50% align:center
So now you charge into
housefires for fun.

00:13:12.375 --> 00:13:15.170 position:50% align:center
I feel like you might be
an adrenaline junkie.

00:13:15.253 --> 00:13:16.963 position:50% align:center
[INCA]
Hmm.

00:13:17.047 --> 00:13:19.382 position:50% align:center
Well, I do enjoy
the thrill of danger.

00:13:19.466 --> 00:13:22.594 position:50% align:center
And the greater the danger,
the bigger the thrill!

00:13:22.677 --> 00:13:23.887 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:25.722 position:50% align:center
Well then, you're in
for a wonderful surprise.

00:13:25.805 --> 00:13:28.099 position:50% align:center
Because you're about to be
scared out of your little head.

00:13:28.183 --> 00:13:30.310 position:50% align:center
If danger's what you
want, then buckle up.

00:13:30.393 --> 00:13:31.895 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:31.978 --> 00:13:37.525 position:50% align:center
You're about to be in all the
danger you could possibly want.

00:13:37.609 --> 00:13:38.651 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:13:38.735 --> 00:13:40.653 position:50% align:center
Is something wrong?
You look spooked.

00:13:40.737 --> 00:13:41.863 position:50% align:center
[INCA]
Who was that?

00:13:41.946 --> 00:13:45.492 position:50% align:center
She kinda came off like
an unhinged psycho.

00:13:45.575 --> 00:13:48.203 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna be in danger soon?

00:13:52.082 --> 00:13:54.042 position:50% align:center
Hell yeah.

00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:00.632 position:50% align:center
[FIRST PILLAR]
It's time.

00:14:00.715 --> 00:14:03.551 position:50% align:center
The Fifth Pillar is
about to be born.

00:14:03.635 --> 00:14:05.303 position:50% align:center
Better hurry.

00:14:05.387 --> 00:14:07.097 position:50% align:center
Hold on. You again?

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:08.973 position:50% align:center
All right, we're gonna
head back home.

00:14:09.057 --> 00:14:10.266 position:50% align:center
Call us next time
ya smell a job.

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:11.601 position:50% align:center
Hold on.

00:14:11.685 --> 00:14:13.561 position:50% align:center
Everything okay?

00:14:14.896 --> 00:14:19.109 position:50% align:center
[INCA] No. Everything's
going straight to hell!

00:14:22.195 --> 00:14:23.655 position:50% align:center
[INCA]
But why?

00:14:23.738 --> 00:14:26.616 position:50% align:center
Why are so many massive
fires about to break out?

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:27.659 position:50% align:center
I don't like this.

00:14:27.742 --> 00:14:30.245 position:50% align:center
Hold on. How many do you see?

00:14:30.328 --> 00:14:32.956 position:50% align:center
[INCA] Enough to kill lots
of people and make us rich!

00:14:33.039 --> 00:14:36.126 position:50% align:center
The whole area's gonna become
a raging sea of flame!

00:14:36.209 --> 00:14:39.212 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:42.841 position:50% align:center
The "Fireground
Thief Schoolgirl"?

00:14:42.924 --> 00:14:45.010 position:50% align:center
Whole Empire knows about her.

00:14:45.093 --> 00:14:48.763 position:50% align:center
She's been beating firefighters
to the scenes of burning houses.

00:14:48.847 --> 00:14:51.391 position:50% align:center
It was thought that she'd
set the fires herself,

00:14:51.474 --> 00:14:53.935 position:50% align:center
but witness testimony
would suggest otherwise.

00:14:54.019 --> 00:14:55.478 position:50% align:center
So, what?

00:14:55.562 --> 00:14:57.981 position:50% align:center
You think she can sense
where the fires will appear?

00:14:58.064 --> 00:15:00.567 position:50% align:center
Ah. Right there.

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:02.277 position:50% align:center
Followed by--

00:15:03.862 --> 00:15:06.114 position:50% align:center
[OBI] I just got a report
of someone who was extorted

00:15:06.197 --> 00:15:09.325 position:50% align:center
and rescued by a strange girl.

00:15:09.409 --> 00:15:11.244 position:50% align:center
This girl is near
the scene of the fire

00:15:11.327 --> 00:15:12.912 position:50% align:center
we're currently heading to.

00:15:12.996 --> 00:15:16.833 position:50% align:center
--[explosions]
--[humming]

00:15:16.916 --> 00:15:18.460 position:50% align:center
Could one of you
grab me a stick?

00:15:18.543 --> 00:15:20.295 position:50% align:center
I wanna conduct the show!

00:15:20.378 --> 00:15:22.213 position:50% align:center
Given this girl's
unusual ability,

00:15:22.297 --> 00:15:24.883 position:50% align:center
there's a good chance
she's the Fifth Pillar.

00:15:24.966 --> 00:15:28.053 position:50% align:center
She saves peoples' lives
but also robs them?

00:15:28.136 --> 00:15:31.097 position:50% align:center
Can't tell if
that's evil or not.

00:15:31.181 --> 00:15:33.808 position:50% align:center
[FIRST PILLAR] The Fire Force
or the White-Clad,

00:15:33.892 --> 00:15:37.228 position:50% align:center
which of you will
reach it first?

00:15:37.312 --> 00:15:39.397 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] If this girl really
is the Fifth Pillar,

00:15:39.481 --> 00:15:42.275 position:50% align:center
we have to keep the
White-Clad away from her.

00:15:42.359 --> 00:15:45.278 position:50% align:center
They'll take her down
the wrong path.

00:15:45.362 --> 00:15:47.530 position:50% align:center
Just like they did to Sho.

00:15:51.284 --> 00:15:53.203 position:50% align:center
Look sharp. We're
almost at the scene.

00:15:53.286 --> 00:15:55.705 position:50% align:center
Hey, guys, better
check your equipment.

00:15:55.789 --> 00:15:57.874 position:50% align:center
Maki, let's use the Owl Eyes.

00:15:57.957 --> 00:15:58.541 position:50% align:center
On it.

00:15:58.625 --> 00:15:59.834 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Huh?

00:16:04.839 --> 00:16:07.550 position:50% align:center
[MAKI]
Owl Eyes are online.

00:16:07.634 --> 00:16:09.052 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Whoa.

00:16:09.135 --> 00:16:11.680 position:50% align:center
I equipped the hover units
with ultra-telephoto cameras.

00:16:11.763 --> 00:16:13.807 position:50% align:center
Can you see the fire scene yet?

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:15.850 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Yeah. It looks bad.

00:16:15.934 --> 00:16:17.435 position:50% align:center
Judging from the size
of these fires

00:16:17.519 --> 00:16:19.354 position:50% align:center
and the way they're spread out,

00:16:19.437 --> 00:16:21.690 position:50% align:center
I'm betting the White-Clad
did this with their bugs.

00:16:21.773 --> 00:16:22.982 position:50% align:center
Wait a second.

00:16:23.066 --> 00:16:25.443 position:50% align:center
We have to fight Infernals
and the White-Clad?

00:16:25.527 --> 00:16:28.530 position:50% align:center
Not to be a downer,
but don't we need more people?

00:16:31.074 --> 00:16:33.952 position:50% align:center
We're here to save lives
and put Infernals to rest.

00:16:34.035 --> 00:16:35.662 position:50% align:center
Maki and Vulcan will
keep us informed

00:16:35.745 --> 00:16:37.539 position:50% align:center
so we can coordinate
our movements.

00:16:37.622 --> 00:16:39.124 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:16:39.207 --> 00:16:41.543 position:50% align:center
As far as I can tell, we've got
eight Infernals on the scene.

00:16:41.626 --> 00:16:44.295 position:50% align:center
One of them is approaching our
position from three o'clock.

00:16:44.379 --> 00:16:45.505 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Hmm.

00:16:45.588 --> 00:16:48.008 position:50% align:center
I have separate missions
for the two of you.

00:16:48.091 --> 00:16:51.052 position:50% align:center
Shinra, find and secure
the Fifth Pillar.

00:16:51.136 --> 00:16:52.303 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir.

00:16:52.387 --> 00:16:56.349 position:50% align:center
[OBI] Arthur, you deal
with that electric girl.

00:16:56.433 --> 00:16:59.894 position:50% align:center
All right. Anyone
have questions?

00:16:59.978 --> 00:17:02.272 position:50% align:center
Company 8, move out!

00:17:02.355 --> 00:17:03.690 position:50% align:center
[COMPANY 8]
Yeah!

00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:08.403 position:50% align:center
How are there this many fires?

00:17:08.486 --> 00:17:09.779 position:50% align:center
We're gonna make a killing!

00:17:09.863 --> 00:17:11.406 position:50% align:center
I think we should
get somewhere safe.

00:17:11.489 --> 00:17:13.783 position:50% align:center
What are you talking about?
This is our chance to get rich!

00:17:13.867 --> 00:17:16.745 position:50% align:center
What are you talking about?
We'd just get ourselves killed!

00:17:16.828 --> 00:17:17.996 position:50% align:center
We don't have the
power to predict

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:20.290 position:50% align:center
where a fire will spring
out next like you do.

00:17:20.373 --> 00:17:23.209 position:50% align:center
We're just regular guys.

00:17:23.293 --> 00:17:25.837 position:50% align:center
'Kay. Fine. I'll go
by myself then.

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.255 position:50% align:center
Wait a sec, don't do it!

00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:29.257 position:50% align:center
There'll be firefighters
down there!

00:17:29.341 --> 00:17:30.925 position:50% align:center
[INCA]
I'll get rich all by myself.

00:17:31.009 --> 00:17:32.677 position:50% align:center
No, don't!

00:17:32.761 --> 00:17:36.431 position:50% align:center
[INCA] A thrill like this?
How can I not jump in?

00:17:36.514 --> 00:17:38.016 position:50% align:center
[HAUMEA]
Antenna is quivering.

00:17:38.099 --> 00:17:39.434 position:50% align:center
Thoughts are a-poppin'.

00:17:39.517 --> 00:17:43.188 position:50% align:center
Brainwaves from all over
town are flowing toward me.

00:17:43.271 --> 00:17:45.023 position:50% align:center
"Oh no, it's a cockroach!"

00:17:45.106 --> 00:17:46.691 position:50% align:center
"This is a little too watery."

00:17:46.775 --> 00:17:48.818 position:50% align:center
"Let's throw in a
bit'a chili and bam!"

00:17:48.902 --> 00:17:51.029 position:50% align:center
Hey, found you.

00:17:51.112 --> 00:17:54.699 position:50% align:center
Now! Guerilla Radio!
Radio Head time!

00:17:54.783 --> 00:17:57.660 position:50% align:center
Sending thoughts your way,
Charon. You copy?

00:17:59.287 --> 00:18:01.873 position:50% align:center
She's standing in the park
at the top of the hill.

00:18:01.956 --> 00:18:04.209 position:50% align:center
I read you. We're on our way.

00:18:04.292 --> 00:18:05.585 position:50% align:center
[CHARON'S MEN]
Yeah!

00:18:05.669 --> 00:18:06.878 position:50% align:center
[PANDA]
I can't let you do this!

00:18:06.961 --> 00:18:08.296 position:50% align:center
[INCA]
Let go of me!

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:10.173 position:50% align:center
I've lived through a much
bigger fire than this one.

00:18:10.256 --> 00:18:12.717 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but that doesn't mean
you have to push your luck.

00:18:12.801 --> 00:18:13.885 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:17.764 --> 00:18:20.475 position:50% align:center
I take it you're
the Fifth Pillar.

00:18:23.395 --> 00:18:25.063 position:50% align:center
Wait. Am I wrong?

00:18:25.146 --> 00:18:27.357 position:50% align:center
Speak up. What is your
name? I'm after "Inca."

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.859 position:50% align:center
So, you know, tell me
if I found you.

00:18:29.943 --> 00:18:31.903 position:50% align:center
Yo. Are you the Fifth
Pillar or not?

00:18:31.986 --> 00:18:33.405 position:50% align:center
I need to know right now.

00:18:33.488 --> 00:18:35.407 position:50% align:center
Hey, what the hell do you
think you're doing?

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:36.574 position:50% align:center
[INCA gasps]

00:18:41.913 --> 00:18:45.291 position:50% align:center
No. No. Sancho!

00:18:45.375 --> 00:18:49.379 position:50% align:center
[INCA]
I can't... breathe. My chest...

00:18:49.462 --> 00:18:51.089 position:50% align:center
[CHARON]
What's the matter, Inca?

00:18:51.172 --> 00:18:55.218 position:50% align:center
Oh. I see. You'll get used
to that pretty quick.

00:18:55.301 --> 00:18:57.095 position:50% align:center
Used to it...

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:01.891 position:50% align:center
All right. Gotta find her.

00:19:01.975 --> 00:19:05.103 position:50% align:center
Come on. The Evangelist
awaits you, kid.

00:19:05.186 --> 00:19:06.688 position:50% align:center
[INCA]
Get used to what?

00:19:06.771 --> 00:19:09.816 position:50% align:center
The sea of flames?
The smell of blood?

00:19:09.899 --> 00:19:12.902 position:50% align:center
Will I just keep chasing
bigger dangers?

00:19:12.986 --> 00:19:16.823 position:50% align:center
It's time to go. We need
you, so come along.

00:19:18.116 --> 00:19:22.162 position:50% align:center
Need me, huh? That's weird.

00:19:22.245 --> 00:19:24.330 position:50% align:center
What do you mean by "we"?

00:19:24.414 --> 00:19:26.207 position:50% align:center
And what is it you
think you need me for?

00:19:26.291 --> 00:19:29.711 position:50% align:center
Oh. I'm with the White-Clad
and we serve the Evangelist.

00:19:29.794 --> 00:19:31.504 position:50% align:center
We're gathering the Pillars
so we can recreate

00:19:31.588 --> 00:19:35.175 position:50% align:center
the Great Cataclysm
from 250 years ago.

00:19:37.886 --> 00:19:40.638 position:50% align:center
[INCA] Huh. I've never seen
a line with words on it.

00:19:40.722 --> 00:19:42.557 position:50% align:center
Start...

00:19:46.644 --> 00:19:48.438 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:48.521 --> 00:19:49.647 position:50% align:center
[INCA]
There's another.

00:19:49.731 --> 00:19:51.232 position:50% align:center
What the--?

00:19:54.694 --> 00:19:55.695 position:50% align:center
[CHARON]
Way to go, kid.

00:19:55.779 --> 00:19:58.281 position:50% align:center
Seems you've awakened
to your powers.

00:19:58.365 --> 00:19:59.783 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:19:59.866 --> 00:20:02.160 position:50% align:center
You need to run for it, Panda.
I'm the one they're after!

00:20:03.203 --> 00:20:04.913 position:50% align:center
You won't escape.

00:20:06.664 --> 00:20:09.209 position:50% align:center
[INCA] "Evangelist"?
"Great Cataclysm"?

00:20:09.292 --> 00:20:11.086 position:50% align:center
What the hell's a "Pillar"?

00:20:11.169 --> 00:20:12.587 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:12.671 --> 00:20:14.798 position:50% align:center
[INCA] That's a weaker line
than the others, but still.

00:20:14.881 --> 00:20:15.715 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:20:15.799 --> 00:20:17.050 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:17.133 --> 00:20:20.303 position:50% align:center
So you can predict faint
traces of heat, too.

00:20:20.387 --> 00:20:22.138 position:50% align:center
I'm impressed.

00:20:28.353 --> 00:20:31.314 position:50% align:center
You don't have anywhere
to run to. Just give up.

00:20:31.398 --> 00:20:32.357 position:50% align:center
We're here, sir.

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.358 position:50% align:center
'Bout time.

00:20:33.441 --> 00:20:34.442 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:34.526 --> 00:20:36.986 position:50% align:center
What do you see?
Is it another fire?

00:20:38.697 --> 00:20:40.740 position:50% align:center
Hey. Tell me what you see!

00:20:40.824 --> 00:20:43.326 position:50% align:center
C'mon. What does it look like?

00:20:44.411 --> 00:20:46.746 position:50% align:center
Wait. Are you just
pullin' my leg?

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:48.790 position:50% align:center
The hero has arrived!

00:20:50.709 --> 00:20:51.751 position:50% align:center
It's okay now.

00:20:51.835 --> 00:20:53.086 position:50% align:center
You're with the Fire Force.

00:20:53.169 --> 00:20:55.964 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I am, and you must
be the Fifth Pillar.

00:20:56.047 --> 00:20:57.132 position:50% align:center
I'm here to secure you.

00:20:57.215 --> 00:20:58.508 position:50% align:center
Wait. The Fifth Pillar?

00:20:58.591 --> 00:21:02.178 position:50% align:center
Why is the Fire Force
after me now?

00:21:02.262 --> 00:21:06.016 position:50% align:center
You wanna "secure me"?
Yeah, we'll see about that.

00:21:06.099 --> 00:21:08.893 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Take it easy.
Leave these guys to me.

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.772 position:50% align:center
All right. Shinra Kusakabe.

00:21:12.856 --> 00:21:15.316 position:50% align:center
The Fourth Pillar comes
to take the Fifth.

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:18.611 position:50% align:center
If I beat you here,
I can bring you both in.

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:20.822 position:50% align:center
[CHARON'S MEN]
One!

00:21:20.905 --> 00:21:21.531 position:50% align:center

[CHARON'S MEN]
Three!

00:21:23.366 --> 00:21:24.034 position:50% align:center
Overwhelm!

One!

00:21:27.495 --> 00:21:28.121 position:50% align:center
Run him through!

[CHARON'S MEN]
Two!

00:21:28.747 --> 00:21:29.414 position:50% align:center
Run him through!

[CHARON'S MEN]
Three!

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:30.707 position:50% align:center
Run him through!

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:31.166 position:50% align:center
[CHARON'S MEN]
Four!

00:21:31.249 --> 00:21:33.335 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:21:41.968 --> 00:21:45.472 position:50% align:center
You're as fast as
they say, Shinra.

00:21:56.816 --> 00:21:59.444 position:50% align:center
I heard you stood your
ground against Sho.

00:21:59.527 --> 00:22:01.863 position:50% align:center
But that was with the
Evangelist's grace.

00:22:01.946 --> 00:22:04.866 position:50% align:center
Right now, you're just
a nimble little fire rat.

00:22:04.949 --> 00:22:06.368 position:50% align:center
Walk!

00:22:15.168 --> 00:22:17.671 position:50% align:center
[HAUMEA] Welp, looks like
Charon's on the warpath.

00:22:17.754 --> 00:22:19.255 position:50% align:center
You're up, Mr. Hero.

00:22:19.339 --> 00:22:22.008 position:50% align:center
Let's see if you can
save the schoolgirl.

00:22:22.092 --> 00:22:23.635 position:50% align:center
I'm betting you'll choke.

00:22:23.718 --> 00:22:26.930 position:50% align:center
Little Inca's gonna
come home with us.

00:22:30.433 --> 00:22:35.230 position:50% align:center
Go on, fire rat. Use those fast
feet of yours to run away.

00:22:35.313 --> 00:22:37.148 position:50% align:center
Why the hell should I?

00:22:37.232 --> 00:22:41.403 position:50% align:center
You're just a noisy gorilla.
I've got this in the bag.

00:24:19.292 --> 00:24:21.378 position:50% align:center
[IRIS] Fires spread
throughout the district,

Company 8 fights hard to thwart
the White-Clad's plans,

00:24:26.424 --> 00:24:27.842 position:50% align:center
but when a Demon
Infernal appears,

00:24:27.926 --> 00:24:30.762 position:50% align:center
it becomes clear they
can't win without help.

00:24:30.845 --> 00:24:32.514 position:50% align:center

Hey, Fire Soldiers!

00:24:32.597 --> 00:24:34.933 position:50% align:center
Keep your weird rope play
