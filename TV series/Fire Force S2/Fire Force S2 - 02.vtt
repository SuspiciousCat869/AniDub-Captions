[OBI] So this is our pic
for the nude calendar.

00:00:20.437 --> 00:00:22.522 position:50% align:center
Look at that
provocative expression.

00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:24.232 position:50% align:center
Way to go, Shinra!

00:00:24.315 --> 00:00:26.026 position:50% align:center
It wasn't deliberate, sir.

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:30.030 position:50% align:center
I was just nervous about
taking my picture naked.

00:00:30.113 --> 00:00:31.823 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Well, back to business.

00:00:31.906 --> 00:00:35.285 position:50% align:center
You're gonna get your sit-down
with Captain Hague of the 4th.

00:00:35.368 --> 00:00:37.162 position:50% align:center
If you're right
about what you saw,

00:00:37.245 --> 00:00:39.456 position:50% align:center
he may be able to help
you understand Adolla

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:42.334 position:50% align:center
or find out the identity
of the Evangelist.

00:00:42.417 --> 00:00:43.918 position:50% align:center
He agreed to meet?

00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:45.170 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Tomorrow.

00:00:45.253 --> 00:00:46.963 position:50% align:center
It probably would've been
harder to arrange,

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:49.758 position:50% align:center
but the captain's granddaughter,
Lieutenant Asako,

00:00:49.841 --> 00:00:52.135 position:50% align:center
helped make it happen for you.

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:55.513 position:50% align:center
She plans to accompany
you, by the way.

00:00:55.597 --> 00:00:57.474 position:50% align:center
Are you familiar with the 4th?

00:00:57.557 --> 00:00:59.392 position:50% align:center
I know a few of
the people there.

00:00:59.476 --> 00:01:01.436 position:50% align:center
I was trained at
the 4th's Academy.

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:03.855 position:50% align:center
It is the only one in
the Force after all.

00:01:03.938 --> 00:01:06.900 position:50% align:center
By the way, why does
the 4th handle training?

00:01:06.983 --> 00:01:09.277 position:50% align:center
[OBI] The Fire Defense
Agency commands the 4th

00:01:09.361 --> 00:01:11.279 position:50% align:center
and regular firefighters.

00:01:11.363 --> 00:01:13.323 position:50% align:center
It's in charge of
the Academy, too,

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:15.950 position:50% align:center
and it uses the 4th
to manage it.

00:01:16.034 --> 00:01:17.994 position:50% align:center
So you say that you
saw Captain Hague

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:20.205 position:50% align:center
while you were having
an Adolla Link.

00:01:20.288 --> 00:01:21.998 position:50% align:center
It could be that
he agreed to see you

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:24.918 position:50% align:center
because he's interested
in your Adolla Burst.

00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:26.878 position:50% align:center
Whatever his motives may be,

00:01:26.961 --> 00:01:29.839 position:50% align:center
this meeting should
be in our favor.

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:32.050 position:50% align:center
Best of luck, Shinra.

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:38.223 position:50% align:center

flame of salvation.

00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:14.778 position:50% align:center

00:03:18.656 --> 00:03:19.699 position:50% align:center
Please excuse us.

00:03:19.783 --> 00:03:21.659 position:50% align:center
We hate to interrupt
your training.

Instructor Pan!

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.916 position:50% align:center
It's been a while, Kusakabe.

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:30.794 position:50% align:center
Forgive me. I should call
you Lieutenant Pan now.

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:32.837 position:50% align:center
I thought they flushed
you down to the 8th--

00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:35.340 position:50% align:center
the cesspool where the
Force sends all its crap.

00:03:35.423 --> 00:03:36.383 position:50% align:center
A roach.

00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:37.509 position:50% align:center
They'd love to flush
you somewhere,

00:03:37.592 --> 00:03:39.219 position:50% align:center
but you'd just crawl
back up the pipes.

00:03:39.302 --> 00:03:40.428 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:03:40.512 --> 00:03:42.472 position:50% align:center
You watch your damn
mouth, mother-killer.

00:03:45.016 --> 00:03:47.143 position:50% align:center
I guess Company 4
doesn't teach this,

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:48.812 position:50% align:center
but if you grab
someone carelessly,

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:50.730 position:50% align:center
ya get joint-locked and thrown.

00:03:50.814 --> 00:03:52.565 position:50% align:center
It's just common
sense at the 8th.

break the wuss's arm.

Calm it down, guys.
Karin's the one who started it.

[KARIN growls]

00:04:02.325 --> 00:04:04.411 position:50% align:center
Kusakabe, you haven't
changed a bit.

Ogun!

00:04:05.578 --> 00:04:07.247 position:50% align:center
You caught me off
guard, that's all.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.165 position:50% align:center
That sounds like
something you'd say.

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:15.255 position:50% align:center
[whistle blowing]

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.092 position:50% align:center
Sorry, sir?

00:04:19.175 --> 00:04:20.552 position:50% align:center
Please use your words.

00:04:20.635 --> 00:04:23.221 position:50% align:center
It's really hard to guess
what you mean from context.

00:04:23.304 --> 00:04:25.974 position:50% align:center
That's the Instructor
Pan I remember.

00:04:26.057 --> 00:04:30.145 position:50% align:center
You actually know quite
a few people here, don't you?

00:04:30.228 --> 00:04:33.273 position:50% align:center
This is my buddy Ogun.
He was at the top of our class.

00:04:33.356 --> 00:04:35.066 position:50% align:center
Shinra here didn't
have any friends,

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.028 position:50% align:center
so Arthur and I decided
to let him run with us.

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:40.155 position:50% align:center
You know that Arthur and
I aren't friends, right?

00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:41.740 position:50% align:center
'Course you aren't.

00:04:41.823 --> 00:04:43.616 position:50% align:center

you're doin' well.

00:04:50.373 --> 00:04:51.916 position:50% align:center
Lieutenant Pan said
he can take a minute

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.418 position:50% align:center
to show us to the captain.

00:04:53.501 --> 00:04:55.128 position:50% align:center
I'd appreciate that, sir.

00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:57.672 position:50% align:center
You can actually
understand him?

[whistle blowing]

00:05:01.926 --> 00:05:03.595 position:50% align:center
So tell me, Lieutenant Asako,

00:05:03.678 --> 00:05:06.556 position:50% align:center
what business do you and the
8th have with Captain Hague?

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:08.099 position:50% align:center
[ASAKO]
I wanted to ask my grandfather

00:05:08.183 --> 00:05:10.101 position:50% align:center
about the scar on his face.

00:05:10.185 --> 00:05:12.395 position:50% align:center
And about why he changed
after getting it.

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:15.732 position:50% align:center
The captain's a great man
and a great leader.

00:05:15.815 --> 00:05:17.692 position:50% align:center
He was the first ever
regular firefighter

00:05:17.776 --> 00:05:21.071 position:50% align:center
to be promoted into the
ranks of the Fire Force.

00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:25.200 position:50% align:center
He's earned the full respect
of all of us here at the 4th.

00:05:25.283 --> 00:05:28.328 position:50% align:center
That still holds true, even now.

00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:31.915 position:50% align:center
Here's his office. He wants
to see you alone, Kusakabe.

[SHINRA]
Do you know why?

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:34.876 position:50% align:center
[ASAKO] I told him that
you wanted to talk

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:37.253 position:50% align:center
about Adolla Bursts,
and since that isn't a subject,

00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:38.672 position:50% align:center
I know much about,

00:05:38.755 --> 00:05:41.007 position:50% align:center
I think its best if I stay
out of the way for now.

00:05:41.091 --> 00:05:43.009 position:50% align:center
I'll talk to him later.

00:05:43.093 --> 00:05:45.929 position:50% align:center

Let's get right to the point.
I'd like to see your flames.

Actually, I'd like
to feel their heat.

Oh, that didn't
startle you, did it?

00:06:14.582 --> 00:06:15.834 position:50% align:center
Of course it did, forgive me.

00:06:15.917 --> 00:06:17.460 position:50% align:center
I should've spoken
more carefully.

00:06:17.544 --> 00:06:19.629 position:50% align:center
The last thing I want is
to make you uncomfortable,

00:06:19.713 --> 00:06:22.424 position:50% align:center
so why don't I try that again?

00:06:22.507 --> 00:06:25.427 position:50% align:center

killing the demon

It was a magnificent experience.

00:08:32.012 --> 00:08:33.471 position:50% align:center
Captain Burns had one, too.

00:08:33.555 --> 00:08:35.807 position:50% align:center
He said he paid for it
with his right eye.

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:37.100 position:50% align:center
What price did you pay?

00:08:37.183 --> 00:08:39.519 position:50% align:center
Does it have to do
with your scar?

00:08:39.602 --> 00:08:42.230 position:50% align:center
Until that day, I had spent
my life working hard

00:08:42.313 --> 00:08:45.567 position:50% align:center
and doing my damnedest to
protect all the people I could.

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:51.197 position:50% align:center
But then, around two years ago,
my way of thinking was changed.

00:08:51.281 --> 00:08:53.408 position:50% align:center
The Great Fire was ravenous.

00:08:53.491 --> 00:08:57.454 position:50% align:center
It swallowed up the whole city,
taking countless lives.

00:08:57.537 --> 00:08:58.872 position:50% align:center
It forced me to recognize

00:08:58.955 --> 00:09:02.667 position:50% align:center
that I'd failed many more
people than I'd saved.

00:09:05.503 --> 00:09:07.505 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:07.589 --> 00:09:08.840 position:50% align:center
[HAGUE]
In that moment,

00:09:08.923 --> 00:09:11.801 position:50% align:center
I felt a hope that was
much like despair.

00:09:11.885 --> 00:09:14.346 position:50% align:center
A sense of liberation.

00:09:14.429 --> 00:09:17.474 position:50% align:center
It was like everything
had been saved.

00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:19.059 position:50% align:center
An "Adolla Link."

00:09:19.142 --> 00:09:21.770 position:50% align:center
Is that what such a
baptism is called?

00:09:21.853 --> 00:09:23.730 position:50% align:center
What I saw there was
not the sunlight

00:09:23.813 --> 00:09:26.858 position:50% align:center
I've been told to
revere by the Temple.

00:09:26.941 --> 00:09:30.987 position:50% align:center
It was the blessed light of God.

00:09:31.071 --> 00:09:32.322 position:50% align:center
I believe that divine realm

00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:35.700 position:50% align:center
to be the very
salvation of mankind.

00:09:35.784 --> 00:09:38.036 position:50% align:center
This claw mark is my stigmata.

00:09:38.119 --> 00:09:40.497 position:50% align:center
It's the truth
carved into my being.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.957 position:50% align:center
The scar that opened my eyes.

00:09:43.041 --> 00:09:44.709 position:50% align:center
Forgive me,
but I must ask again.

00:09:44.793 --> 00:09:47.921 position:50% align:center
Please, Kusakabe, set me
alight with your holy flames!

00:09:48.004 --> 00:09:50.256 position:50% align:center
Let me see that
divine realm again!

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:51.591 position:50% align:center
Hold on just a minute.

00:09:51.675 --> 00:09:53.468 position:50% align:center
Captain Hague, are you
seriously saying you think

00:09:53.551 --> 00:09:56.930 position:50% align:center
that unearthly hellscape
is actually holy?

00:09:57.013 --> 00:09:59.224 position:50% align:center
Whether that realm is
considered sacred or profane

00:09:59.307 --> 00:10:01.309 position:50% align:center
means nothing to me.

00:10:01.393 --> 00:10:03.895 position:50% align:center
The gods and devils mortals
imagine unto themselves

00:10:03.978 --> 00:10:06.815 position:50% align:center
are mere imitations of Adolla.

00:10:06.898 --> 00:10:09.943 position:50% align:center
Be it heaven or hell,
it was the truth.

00:10:10.026 --> 00:10:11.569 position:50% align:center
I only wish I could
share that truth

00:10:11.653 --> 00:10:14.030 position:50% align:center
so that all the world
could be enlightened!

00:10:14.114 --> 00:10:15.990 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] I didn't feel
anything like salvation

00:10:16.074 --> 00:10:18.535 position:50% align:center
when I had my Adolla links.

00:10:18.618 --> 00:10:19.786 position:50% align:center
[HAGUE]
You hold an Adolla Burst,

00:10:19.869 --> 00:10:22.372 position:50% align:center
so it may well feel
mundane to you.

00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:26.001 position:50% align:center
However, I am but a human being.

00:10:27.335 --> 00:10:29.379 position:50% align:center
I'm as human as you are.

00:10:29.462 --> 00:10:31.339 position:50% align:center
[ASAKO screams]

00:10:35.343 --> 00:10:37.012 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
The mascots?

00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:42.809 position:50% align:center
Shinra Kusakabe. Prepare to die.

00:10:42.892 --> 00:10:44.853 position:50% align:center
Are you serious right now?

00:10:44.936 --> 00:10:46.146 position:50% align:center
You can't really be that upset

00:10:46.229 --> 00:10:48.148 position:50% align:center
just 'cause I flipped
you on your back.

00:10:48.231 --> 00:10:49.733 position:50% align:center
This is your chance.

00:10:49.816 --> 00:10:53.028 position:50% align:center
If that twerp wants a fight to
the death, then give him one.

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:57.032 position:50% align:center
[HAGUE]
What's come over you three?

00:10:57.115 --> 00:10:58.324 position:50% align:center
[FIRST PILLAR]
Kill him.

00:10:58.408 --> 00:11:01.077 position:50% align:center
You finally have a target
for your rage, Shinra.

00:11:01.161 --> 00:11:03.413 position:50% align:center
So let it out. Burn him.

00:11:03.496 --> 00:11:05.373 position:50% align:center
Burn them all.

00:11:05.457 --> 00:11:07.625 position:50% align:center
I should burn everything.

00:11:07.709 --> 00:11:09.127 position:50% align:center
What did you just say?

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:11.338 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's what
I'm talkin' about!

00:11:11.421 --> 00:11:13.548 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
I'll burn it all down!

00:11:13.631 --> 00:11:15.800 position:50% align:center
Do it.

00:11:15.884 --> 00:11:19.220 position:50% align:center
[HAGUE]
So this is your Adolla Burst.

00:11:19.304 --> 00:11:21.639 position:50% align:center
I love it. I love it!

00:11:21.723 --> 00:11:23.391 position:50% align:center
--[whistle blows]
--[ASAKO] Grandpa!

00:11:23.475 --> 00:11:25.435 position:50% align:center
Seems like our crewmen
have lost their minds.

00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:27.437 position:50% align:center
Kusakabe's acting strange, too.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:30.315 position:50% align:center
It's almost like the four
of them have been possessed.

00:11:30.398 --> 00:11:31.816 position:50% align:center
--[VOICE C] Mother-killer!
--[VOICE A] He's such a creep.

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:33.401 position:50% align:center
--[VOICE D] Devil!
--[VOICE B] You're a devil!

00:11:33.485 --> 00:11:36.613 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] They said all that crap
even though they knew nothing.

00:11:36.696 --> 00:11:38.990 position:50% align:center
Or maybe I'm the one
who knew nothing.

00:11:39.074 --> 00:11:42.911 position:50% align:center
Like it matters.
I've had enough.

00:11:42.994 --> 00:11:46.206 position:50% align:center
All of you can drop dead.

00:11:46.289 --> 00:11:48.708 position:50% align:center
You need to start
behaving yourselves.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.972 position:50% align:center
I just wanted to use
some Company 4 soldiers

00:12:03.056 --> 00:12:04.432 position:50% align:center
to get under Shinra's skin,

00:12:04.516 --> 00:12:06.810 position:50% align:center
but it looks like the First
Pillar's beaten me to it.

00:12:06.893 --> 00:12:08.311 position:50% align:center
Wait, the First Pillar?

00:12:08.395 --> 00:12:10.772 position:50% align:center
Hey, Haumea, did you actually
just say the First Pillar?

00:12:10.855 --> 00:12:12.565 position:50% align:center
"Under his skin"?
Well, how do you mean?

00:12:12.649 --> 00:12:14.776 position:50% align:center
Is she using an Adolla Link
to contact him or what?

00:12:14.859 --> 00:12:15.860 position:50% align:center
You've gotta tell me!

00:12:15.944 --> 00:12:17.153 position:50% align:center
[HAUMEA]
Shut up, Charon!

00:12:17.237 --> 00:12:18.363 position:50% align:center
If you're gonna
be this annoying,

00:12:18.446 --> 00:12:19.781 position:50% align:center
you may as well just die!

00:12:19.864 --> 00:12:20.824 position:50% align:center
[CHARON]
Come on, just tell me

00:12:20.907 --> 00:12:21.950 position:50% align:center
if she came through
an Adolla Link!

00:12:22.033 --> 00:12:23.952 position:50% align:center
[HAUMEA]
Yes! Of course it was, dumbass!

00:12:24.035 --> 00:12:24.994 position:50% align:center
Are you stupid?

00:12:25.078 --> 00:12:26.996 position:50% align:center
We know where the
First Pillar is.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.248 position:50% align:center
And since we know she's there,

00:12:28.331 --> 00:12:30.542 position:50% align:center
she obviously didn't
come here in person.

00:12:30.625 --> 00:12:32.919 position:50% align:center
She's using an Adolla
Link to possess Shinra.

00:12:33.003 --> 00:12:35.005 position:50% align:center
His hate and anger
caught her attention,

00:12:35.088 --> 00:12:36.798 position:50% align:center
so she mixed it with her own.

00:12:36.881 --> 00:12:39.634 position:50% align:center
Now she's got him in perfect
sync with her craziness.

00:12:39.718 --> 00:12:42.053 position:50% align:center
Against them, we have that
old elite fireman captain

00:12:42.137 --> 00:12:44.931 position:50% align:center
and his buff-slinging
lieutenant.

00:12:45.015 --> 00:12:46.516 position:50% align:center
[whistle blows]

00:12:49.978 --> 00:12:54.315 position:50% align:center
Know what? I'd like to
take this out of my office.

00:12:54.399 --> 00:12:57.068 position:50% align:center
I'd like to avoid burning
down my fire station.

00:12:57.152 --> 00:12:58.570 position:50% align:center
Type One Fire Axes!

00:12:58.653 --> 00:13:00.196 position:50% align:center
[whistle blows]

00:13:02.699 --> 00:13:05.785 position:50% align:center
It feels like I'm up against
a beast in human clothing.

00:13:05.869 --> 00:13:08.371 position:50% align:center
There's no need
to hold back anymore.

00:13:08.455 --> 00:13:11.791 position:50% align:center
Let's kill them.
Whoever gets in our way.

00:13:11.875 --> 00:13:13.501 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Who is this girl?

00:13:13.585 --> 00:13:17.797 position:50% align:center
How can she feel so much
hatred? It's overpowering.

00:13:20.008 --> 00:13:21.676 position:50% align:center
[HAGUE yells]

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.428 position:50% align:center
[HAGUE]
It's hot! Ahh!

00:13:23.511 --> 00:13:25.930 position:50% align:center
Adolla! Adolla!

00:13:26.014 --> 00:13:27.182 position:50% align:center
[PAN]
What are you doing, Captain?

00:13:27.265 --> 00:13:28.725 position:50% align:center
You should've been
able to avoid that!

00:13:28.808 --> 00:13:30.226 position:50% align:center
[whistle blows]

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:33.063 position:50% align:center
[HAGUE]
It's good. So very good.

00:13:33.146 --> 00:13:34.564 position:50% align:center
Even knowing that it'll kill me

00:13:34.647 --> 00:13:37.359 position:50% align:center
if I bask in its warmth
for too long...

00:13:37.442 --> 00:13:39.569 position:50% align:center
...I want more. Yes, I do.

00:13:39.652 --> 00:13:40.862 position:50% align:center
Something's wrong with him.

00:13:40.945 --> 00:13:43.573 position:50% align:center
Pull it together, sir!
He really could kill you!

00:13:43.656 --> 00:13:44.908 position:50% align:center
[HAGUE]
Kill me?

00:13:44.991 --> 00:13:48.495 position:50% align:center
No, I need to stick around
for the sake of the 4th.

00:13:48.578 --> 00:13:50.121 position:50% align:center
[whistle blows]

00:13:50.205 --> 00:13:51.831 position:50% align:center
[HAGUE] Ah, that's incredible
in its own right!

00:13:51.915 --> 00:13:53.041 position:50% align:center
[whistle blows]

00:13:53.124 --> 00:13:54.542 position:50% align:center
Even with me boosting
his heat resistance,

00:13:54.626 --> 00:13:56.586 position:50% align:center
the captain won't
last much longer.

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:59.089 position:50% align:center
[PAN]
Just dodge.

00:13:59.172 --> 00:14:01.174 position:50% align:center
I know those flame spears.

00:14:01.257 --> 00:14:04.177 position:50% align:center
This guy thinks he can visit my
company and trash the place.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.763 position:50% align:center
I can't even take my eyes
off him for a minute.

00:14:06.846 --> 00:14:08.682 position:50% align:center
You made it just in time, Ogun!

00:14:08.765 --> 00:14:10.433 position:50% align:center
And... Arthur?

00:14:10.517 --> 00:14:12.644 position:50% align:center
My captain thought the
electricity user we fought

00:14:12.727 --> 00:14:15.146 position:50% align:center
in the Nether might
try to come after Shinra.

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:18.775 position:50% align:center
So he asked me to follow Shinra
here and play bodyguard.

00:14:22.362 --> 00:14:25.115 position:50% align:center
Something's not right.
Is that really you, Shinra?

00:14:25.198 --> 00:14:26.449 position:50% align:center
What happened?

00:14:26.533 --> 00:14:28.910 position:50% align:center
Is that woman from the
Nether making you do this?

00:14:28.993 --> 00:14:33.164 position:50% align:center
No, wait. I'm sensing yet
another presence inside you.

00:14:33.248 --> 00:14:35.709 position:50% align:center
Burn you. Burn you.

00:14:35.792 --> 00:14:39.045 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
You look hideous. As usual.

00:14:39.129 --> 00:14:40.505 position:50% align:center
Time for a devil hunt.

00:14:40.588 --> 00:14:41.881 position:50% align:center
Slow down.

00:14:41.965 --> 00:14:44.175 position:50% align:center
Step one is to try 'n bring
him back to his senses.

00:14:44.259 --> 00:14:46.386 position:50% align:center
That's easy to say,
but where do we start?

00:14:46.469 --> 00:14:48.805 position:50% align:center
If it was an Adolla Link
that caused Kusakabe

00:14:48.888 --> 00:14:50.515 position:50% align:center
to start acting this way,

00:14:50.598 --> 00:14:52.559 position:50% align:center
then perhaps we should
break that link.

00:14:52.642 --> 00:14:55.020 position:50% align:center
Hang back, sir, you're like
a moth to his flames.

00:14:55.103 --> 00:14:57.522 position:50% align:center
You two stop him before
he can cause more damage.

00:14:57.605 --> 00:14:58.440 position:50% align:center
I'll back you up!

00:14:58.523 --> 00:15:00.066 position:50% align:center
He's coming.

00:15:01.776 --> 00:15:02.819 position:50% align:center
[whistle blows]

00:15:02.902 --> 00:15:06.448 position:50% align:center
He's that fast?
No way. I couldn't see--

00:15:06.531 --> 00:15:07.574 position:50% align:center
[OGUN coughing]

00:15:07.657 --> 00:15:09.242 position:50% align:center
I used my
muscle-enhancing whistle

00:15:09.325 --> 00:15:10.869 position:50% align:center
to increase your durability.

00:15:10.952 --> 00:15:12.871 position:50% align:center
Yeah, well, it hurt
like hell anyway.

00:15:12.954 --> 00:15:15.206 position:50% align:center
Hey, now, no fair.

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:17.834 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR] So that's what it's
like to get hit by the Rapid.

You're acting weird.

He's fine. In fact,
this is what we want.

mad dumb right now.

Are you simply excited to

you're a blueblood?

household did you grow up in?

But seeing as you rejected me,
I don't feel like answering.

[SHINRA]
Come back!

00:22:18.213 --> 00:22:22.050 position:50% align:center
[FIRST PILLAR] Oh! By the way,
we've had Haumea, Sho, you,

00:22:22.133 --> 00:22:25.178 position:50% align:center
and now, it looks like a new
Pillar is about to be born.

00:22:25.261 --> 00:22:26.346 position:50% align:center
A new Pillar?

00:22:26.429 --> 00:22:28.556 position:50% align:center
You mean someone who
has an Adolla Burst?

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:29.724 position:50% align:center
[FIRST PILLAR]
If I'm able to sense

00:22:29.808 --> 00:22:31.643 position:50% align:center
that a new Pillar is coming,

00:22:31.726 --> 00:22:34.854 position:50% align:center
you can bet that the
Evangelist knows, too.

00:22:34.938 --> 00:22:37.565 position:50% align:center
The Fire Force
or the White-Clad,

00:22:37.649 --> 00:22:40.402 position:50% align:center
which of you will
reach it first?

00:22:40.485 --> 00:22:42.612 position:50% align:center
I wonder...

00:24:19.042 --> 00:24:20.877 position:50% align:center
[IRIS] The mysterious girl
who possessed Shinra

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:23.338 position:50% align:center
predicted the appearance
of another Adolla Burst.

00:24:23.421 --> 00:24:25.006 position:50% align:center
It seems likely that
this new Pillar

00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:27.634 position:50% align:center
will be a schoolgirl known
as the "Fireground Thief."

00:24:27.717 --> 00:24:29.594 position:50% align:center
Wait, but she's a delinquent!

00:24:29.678 --> 00:24:32.514 position:50% align:center
[INCA] I can get you out of
here safely if you want.

00:24:32.597 --> 00:24:35.975 position:50% align:center
But only if you make it
worth my while, understand?
