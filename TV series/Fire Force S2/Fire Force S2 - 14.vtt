00:00:21.312 --> 00:00:23.606 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN] Lisa, can ya
please hand me my gauge?

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.734 position:50% align:center
[LISA]
Okay. Here ya go.

00:00:25.817 --> 00:00:27.068 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
Thank you.

00:00:27.152 --> 00:00:30.447 position:50% align:center
Hey, are you gonna build
something new for us?

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:31.781 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
Yeah, there's no tellin'

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:34.743 position:50% align:center
when the Evangelist's
cronies will pop up again.

00:00:34.826 --> 00:00:37.704 position:50% align:center
Perfect. Thanks,
that's all for today.

00:00:37.787 --> 00:00:40.248 position:50% align:center
[LISA] All right.
I'm here if you need me.

00:00:40.331 --> 00:00:41.624 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:00:44.586 --> 00:00:47.839 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN] Haijima's gotten away
with a lot of twisted crap.

00:00:47.922 --> 00:00:50.425 position:50% align:center
But after what Dr.
Giovanni did to her,

00:00:50.508 --> 00:00:52.510 position:50% align:center
I'm going to make damn
sure those bastards

00:00:52.594 --> 00:00:54.554 position:50% align:center
get what's comin' to 'em.

00:00:54.637 --> 00:00:57.057 position:50% align:center
Sound good.
We should make 'em pay.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.350 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:01:00.393 --> 00:01:03.063 position:50% align:center
Shinra, before you started
at the training academy,

00:01:03.146 --> 00:01:05.315 position:50% align:center
you were at a Haijima
facility, right?

00:01:05.398 --> 00:01:07.150 position:50% align:center
That means you could be a spy!

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:08.902 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, of course I'm a spy.

00:01:08.985 --> 00:01:12.197 position:50% align:center
And I signed up to be one just
so I could assassinate you!

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.908 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR] Well, it's all
over now! Come at me!

00:01:14.991 --> 00:01:17.160 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] You just came
at me, Sir Dorks-a-lot!

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:18.453 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR] You'll never
best the swordsmanship

00:01:18.536 --> 00:01:20.246 position:50% align:center
of the Knight King!

00:01:21.623 --> 00:01:22.874 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
You actually hit me, Devil!

00:01:22.957 --> 00:01:24.125 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
You're the one who hit me first!

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:25.418 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
Shut up, demon breath!

00:01:25.502 --> 00:01:27.712 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Go join the knights
of the dumb table!

00:01:29.464 --> 00:01:30.799 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Uh?

00:01:33.176 --> 00:01:35.720 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN] Shinra, you really
used to be at Haijima?

00:01:35.804 --> 00:01:38.223 position:50% align:center
Well, yeah, I was
there for a while.

00:01:38.306 --> 00:01:41.267 position:50% align:center
My abilities showed up
after the fire 12 years ago.

00:01:41.351 --> 00:01:42.560 position:50% align:center
And there was a period of time

00:01:42.644 --> 00:01:45.647 position:50% align:center
when I really couldn't
control them very well.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.609 position:50% align:center
So I got sent to a Haijima
pyrokinesis development place

00:01:49.693 --> 00:01:51.736 position:50% align:center
and they did experiments on me.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.823 position:50% align:center
I'll never forget how
cold everyone was.

00:01:54.906 --> 00:01:57.867 position:50% align:center
Me and the other kids were
just test subjects to them.

00:01:57.951 --> 00:02:01.371 position:50% align:center
They didn't care about
anything except our abilities.

00:02:01.454 --> 00:02:04.708 position:50% align:center
I guess it could've been worse,
but it was a bad place to be.

00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:05.500 position:50% align:center
Hey, Shinra.

00:02:05.583 --> 00:02:07.293 position:50% align:center
Uh! Why would you do that?

00:02:07.377 --> 00:02:08.336 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
There's kind of a thing

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.879 position:50% align:center
I need to talk
to everyone about.

00:02:09.963 --> 00:02:11.464 position:50% align:center
Could you gather the troops?

00:02:11.548 --> 00:02:13.717 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sure, no problem.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.343 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Thanks.

00:03:57.487 --> 00:04:00.740 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] So, uh, what did
you need to talk about?

00:04:01.866 --> 00:04:04.619 position:50% align:center
This will be extremely
hard for me to say,

00:04:04.703 --> 00:04:07.789 position:50% align:center
and I offer my most
heartfelt apologies,

00:04:07.872 --> 00:04:10.375 position:50% align:center
but I, Viktor Licht,

00:04:10.458 --> 00:04:14.504 position:50% align:center
was embedded with you here
at the 8th as a Haijima spy.

00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:16.131 position:50% align:center
[IRIS gasps]

00:04:19.843 --> 00:04:22.053 position:50% align:center
So... bombshell, no response?

00:04:22.137 --> 00:04:24.305 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Mhm. We knew.

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:25.890 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Wha--?

00:04:25.974 --> 00:04:27.767 position:50% align:center
Why blow your cover now?

00:04:27.851 --> 00:04:30.645 position:50% align:center
I mean you never officially
joined Company 8.

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:32.272 position:50% align:center
You've always been with Haijima.

00:04:32.355 --> 00:04:33.732 position:50% align:center
Hah. Yeah, that's true.

00:04:33.815 --> 00:04:36.401 position:50% align:center
Uh! Does that mean Licht
isn't really one of us?

00:04:36.484 --> 00:04:39.738 position:50% align:center
Uh, don't worry.
As you were, Sister, okay?

00:04:39.821 --> 00:04:42.282 position:50% align:center
Then that makes
this much easier.

00:04:42.365 --> 00:04:44.284 position:50% align:center
My primary objective
in coming to the 8th

00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:48.830 position:50% align:center
was to observe our little buddy
Shinra and his Adolla Burst.

00:04:48.913 --> 00:04:51.916 position:50% align:center
Much like the Evangelist,
Haijima has been very interested

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.252 position:50% align:center
in tracking down the
next Adolla Burster.

00:04:54.336 --> 00:04:55.545 position:50% align:center
And for that reason,

00:04:55.628 --> 00:04:57.422 position:50% align:center
they sent me here to keep
an eye on this one.

00:04:57.505 --> 00:04:59.883 position:50% align:center
But Shinra had already
been at Haijima, right?

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:01.134 position:50% align:center
It seems to me like they let him

00:05:01.217 --> 00:05:03.011 position:50% align:center
get away from them
pretty easily.

00:05:03.094 --> 00:05:07.557 position:50% align:center
Yup, and that's why I wanted
to talk to everyone today.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.726 position:50% align:center
Shinra, after your
house burned down,

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:11.978 position:50% align:center
the Haijima pyrokinesis
development institute

00:05:12.062 --> 00:05:13.271 position:50% align:center
took you in.

00:05:13.355 --> 00:05:16.524 position:50% align:center
They did. I was
there till I was 12.

00:05:16.608 --> 00:05:19.903 position:50% align:center
When I was 13, I enrolled at
the Fire Force Training Academy.

00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:21.363 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Now, as it happens,

00:05:21.446 --> 00:05:23.656 position:50% align:center
it's true that they were
researching Adolla Bursts

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.785 position:50% align:center
at the facility where you lived,
but for whatever reason,

00:05:26.868 --> 00:05:29.162 position:50% align:center
they could never identify
your flame as being one.

00:05:29.245 --> 00:05:31.122 position:50% align:center
They just totally missed it.

00:05:31.206 --> 00:05:32.457 position:50% align:center
Heh. Lightweight.

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:33.583 position:50% align:center
Oh, shut up.

00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:35.502 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't be
laughing, dweeb.

00:05:35.585 --> 00:05:38.254 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] And that's where
the problem started.

00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:39.756 position:50% align:center
Once they figured out
that they let one

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:42.133 position:50% align:center
slip through their fingers,
they got a lot more extreme

00:05:42.217 --> 00:05:43.885 position:50% align:center
with their methods
of experimentation,

00:05:43.968 --> 00:05:48.139 position:50% align:center
and kids are gettin'
pretty hurt.

00:05:48.223 --> 00:05:51.393 position:50% align:center
Some to the extent that they
will never fully recover.

00:05:51.476 --> 00:05:52.936 position:50% align:center
All because Haijima's so afraid

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:54.813 position:50% align:center
of missing another
one like Shinra.

00:05:54.896 --> 00:05:58.149 position:50% align:center
Really? 'Cause of me?

00:05:58.233 --> 00:06:00.777 position:50% align:center
And now, they've
finally ordered me

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.612 position:50% align:center
to bring Shinra back to them.

00:06:02.696 --> 00:06:05.448 position:50% align:center
There's no way in hell we're
selling out one of our crewmen.

00:06:05.532 --> 00:06:08.451 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] I won't pretend this
isn't a precarious situation.

00:06:08.535 --> 00:06:10.370 position:50% align:center
It most certainly is.

00:06:10.453 --> 00:06:12.247 position:50% align:center
Obviously, they're after
his Adolla Burst,

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.124 position:50% align:center
but this could be
our only opportunity

00:06:14.207 --> 00:06:16.209 position:50% align:center
to investigate Haijima.

00:06:16.292 --> 00:06:18.545 position:50% align:center
None of their employees
know the nuts and bolts

00:06:18.628 --> 00:06:21.548 position:50% align:center
of the development facility,
myself included.

00:06:21.631 --> 00:06:23.425 position:50% align:center
But if we agree to go along,

00:06:23.508 --> 00:06:26.094 position:50% align:center
we may be able to find the
connection to the Evangelist

00:06:26.177 --> 00:06:27.637 position:50% align:center
that we're looking for.

00:06:27.721 --> 00:06:28.805 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Hmm...

00:06:28.888 --> 00:06:30.807 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
You're a spy for Haijima.

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:32.809 position:50% align:center
so why should any
of us trust you?

00:06:32.892 --> 00:06:34.477 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Hold on, Vulcan.

00:06:34.561 --> 00:06:36.896 position:50% align:center
If what he's telling us is true,

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:40.275 position:50% align:center
then I can't just leave all
those kids there to suffer.

00:06:40.358 --> 00:06:43.737 position:50% align:center
Captain Obi, I'm down with this.

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.781 position:50% align:center
Part of being a hero is
keeping children safe.

00:06:46.865 --> 00:06:49.325 position:50% align:center
Shinra, don't rush into this.

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:53.079 position:50% align:center
It'll be three years before the
truth about Amaterasu gets out.

00:06:53.163 --> 00:06:55.457 position:50% align:center
Do you think the Evangelist
is gonna sit back till then

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:56.708 position:50% align:center
and do nothing?

00:06:56.791 --> 00:06:59.044 position:50% align:center
We can't waste time
by playing it safe!

00:06:59.127 --> 00:07:00.962 position:50% align:center
She still has my brother.

00:07:01.046 --> 00:07:02.630 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Inspector Licht,

00:07:02.714 --> 00:07:06.134 position:50% align:center
we need to know whose
side you're really on.

00:07:06.217 --> 00:07:08.011 position:50% align:center
Are your loyalties
still with Haijima,

00:07:08.094 --> 00:07:09.679 position:50% align:center
or are they with us?

00:07:09.763 --> 00:07:11.681 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I'm on both sides.

00:07:11.765 --> 00:07:14.434 position:50% align:center
I signed up with Haijima
so I could look for the truth,

00:07:14.517 --> 00:07:16.519 position:50% align:center
but right now, I'm leaning
towards the 8th.

00:07:16.603 --> 00:07:18.021 position:50% align:center
Stickin' with you
guys instead of them

00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:19.647 position:50% align:center
could get me closer to my goal.

00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:21.900 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA, MAKI, IRIS]
Uh.

00:07:21.983 --> 00:07:24.027 position:50% align:center
[OBI] Sounds to me like
you're not really

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:26.946 position:50% align:center
on anyone's side but your own.

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:28.907 position:50% align:center
Very perceptive.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:32.619 position:50% align:center
[OBI] Shinra, I can't let you
go to Haijima on your own.

00:07:32.702 --> 00:07:34.537 position:50% align:center
It's too dangerous.

00:07:34.621 --> 00:07:36.956 position:50% align:center
So that means I will be
sending all of Company 8

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:37.874 position:50% align:center
on this mission.

00:07:37.957 --> 00:07:39.417 position:50% align:center
[COMPANY 8]
Yes, sir!

00:07:39.501 --> 00:07:42.504 position:50% align:center
The investigation of
Haijima starts now!

00:07:42.587 --> 00:07:43.963 position:50% align:center
[COMPANY 8]
Roger!

00:07:48.593 --> 00:07:52.180 position:50% align:center
'Kay, Nataku,
this is a combat test.

00:07:52.263 --> 00:07:54.849 position:50% align:center
[RESEARCHER A] Are you ready
to get started, Kurono?

00:08:06.611 --> 00:08:10.740 position:50% align:center
So, Nataku, you wanna go
a round with Uncle Reaper?

00:08:10.824 --> 00:08:12.575 position:50% align:center
[NATAKU]
Uh. Sure.

00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:38.101 position:50% align:center
[RESEARCHER B] So this is his
third combat test, huh?

00:08:38.184 --> 00:08:40.562 position:50% align:center
[RESEARCHER A] I know he's kind
of a bonus from the incident,

00:08:40.645 --> 00:08:43.023 position:50% align:center
but please try not to break him.

00:08:51.031 --> 00:08:53.283 position:50% align:center
[RESEARCHER A]
All right, you may begin.

00:08:54.951 --> 00:08:56.453 position:50% align:center
[KURONO]
Come on, Uncle Reaper needs you

00:08:56.536 --> 00:08:58.830 position:50% align:center
to try out this experiment.

00:08:58.913 --> 00:09:02.292 position:50% align:center
Can you tell me something,
Uncle Reaper?

00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:05.879 position:50% align:center
I wanna know when
I can go back home.

00:09:05.962 --> 00:09:10.258 position:50% align:center
You know what this symbol
represents? The Grim Reaper.

00:09:10.342 --> 00:09:13.678 position:50% align:center
You won't go home alive.

00:09:13.762 --> 00:09:16.639 position:50% align:center
And since this is the third
time we're doing this,

00:09:16.723 --> 00:09:18.975 position:50% align:center
I'm done playing around.

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:23.688 position:50% align:center
[KURONO] Which means you're
gonna have to get serious, too,

00:09:23.772 --> 00:09:26.358 position:50% align:center
or you're going home
in a body bag.

00:09:26.441 --> 00:09:29.944 position:50% align:center
So show me what you can do.
Your real power.

00:09:31.196 --> 00:09:32.197 position:50% align:center
[REKKA]
My stars!

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:35.909 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah! Get fired up!
You got this!

00:09:35.992 --> 00:09:37.827 position:50% align:center
I mean, the bug
chose you, didn't it?

00:09:37.911 --> 00:09:40.789 position:50% align:center
Show 'em all what being
hot-blooded really means!

00:09:40.872 --> 00:09:44.209 position:50% align:center
It's in you! That fiery spirit!

00:09:44.292 --> 00:09:48.588 position:50% align:center
Fire!

00:09:48.672 --> 00:09:52.133 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:09:52.217 --> 00:09:54.094 position:50% align:center
I feel the fire! Yeah!

00:09:54.177 --> 00:09:56.388 position:50% align:center
That's right! Fire! My stars!

00:09:56.471 --> 00:09:59.391 position:50% align:center
[NATAKU yelling]

00:10:01.309 --> 00:10:05.397 position:50% align:center
Fire! Fire!

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:11.528 position:50% align:center
[yelling]

00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:14.781 position:50% align:center
That's more like it! You're
just like a shootin' star!

00:10:14.864 --> 00:10:19.327 position:50% align:center
Let that fire keep on burnin'
hotter and hotter! Yeah!

00:10:19.411 --> 00:10:21.955 position:50% align:center
Now let it out! Make it explode!

00:10:22.038 --> 00:10:24.582 position:50% align:center
I know you've got it
in you! Gimme a roar!

00:10:24.666 --> 00:10:25.458 position:50% align:center
[REKKA yelling]

00:10:25.542 --> 00:10:31.548 position:50% align:center
[yelling]

00:10:34.592 --> 00:10:36.344 position:50% align:center
[OPERATOR A]
Flame output intensifying.

00:10:36.428 --> 00:10:38.930 position:50% align:center
However, no Adolla
Burst detected.

00:10:39.014 --> 00:10:41.766 position:50% align:center
[OPERATOR B] His mental state
is becoming unstable.

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:45.395 position:50% align:center
Some kind of PTSD?
What now? Do we stop?

00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:47.105 position:50% align:center
Well, from the
stories I've heard,

00:10:47.188 --> 00:10:50.984 position:50% align:center
Shinra Kusakabe's Adolla Burst
finally sparked during combat.

00:10:51.067 --> 00:10:54.654 position:50% align:center
Keep going. And if this
kid breaks, he breaks.

00:10:54.738 --> 00:10:56.865 position:50% align:center
It would be a shame, though.

00:11:12.088 --> 00:11:15.633 position:50% align:center
Get up. We're still
not done here.

00:11:17.469 --> 00:11:20.972 position:50% align:center
[KURONO] Look, this is Uncle
Reaper's job. You understand.

00:11:21.056 --> 00:11:23.141 position:50% align:center
So I'm gonna need you
to help me do it right.

00:11:23.224 --> 00:11:25.226 position:50% align:center
Now, on your feet.

00:11:28.063 --> 00:11:29.522 position:50% align:center
[RESEARCHER B]
This is hard to watch.

00:11:29.606 --> 00:11:31.441 position:50% align:center
I don't get how he can
go through with it.

00:11:31.524 --> 00:11:34.402 position:50% align:center
[RESEARCHER A] Yeah, apparently
to him, this is his dream job.

00:11:34.486 --> 00:11:37.947 position:50% align:center
His skills are good enough to
be a part of a real combat unit,

00:11:38.031 --> 00:11:41.951 position:50% align:center
but from what I understand,
he requested to stay here.

00:11:42.035 --> 00:11:44.371 position:50% align:center
Just so he can pick on children.

00:11:44.454 --> 00:11:47.457 position:50% align:center
His right arm is totally
carbonized from tephrosis,

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:50.335 position:50% align:center
but he still can't get
enough destruction.

00:11:50.418 --> 00:11:52.504 position:50% align:center
So he's out of his mind, then?

00:11:52.587 --> 00:11:54.631 position:50% align:center
His abilities are
off the charts.

00:11:54.714 --> 00:11:59.469 position:50% align:center
They say he could even keep up
with the captain of the 7th.

00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:02.597 position:50% align:center
All right, Kurono. We're done.

00:12:18.988 --> 00:12:20.699 position:50% align:center
[RESEARCHER A]
Nice work in there, Kurono.

00:12:20.782 --> 00:12:22.492 position:50% align:center
[RESEARCHER B]
Yeah, very impressive.

00:12:22.575 --> 00:12:26.579 position:50% align:center
But doesn't beating up kids
make you feel a little weird?

00:12:26.663 --> 00:12:30.417 position:50% align:center
Punishing the weak's
my favorite thing to do.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.043 position:50% align:center
And the weaker my opponent,

00:12:32.127 --> 00:12:34.337 position:50% align:center
the smaller my risk
of getting hurt.

00:12:34.421 --> 00:12:35.422 position:50% align:center
That must be why you're willing

00:12:35.505 --> 00:12:38.341 position:50% align:center
to follow orders
from your superiors.

00:12:39.926 --> 00:12:42.137 position:50% align:center
You're really getting
under my skin.

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:44.139 position:50% align:center
Do you not realize
when I say "the weak"

00:12:44.222 --> 00:12:46.599 position:50% align:center
that I'm talking
about you, as well?

00:12:46.683 --> 00:12:50.812 position:50% align:center
And I'm incredibly good at
crushing weak people like you.

00:12:50.895 --> 00:12:53.606 position:50% align:center
Sorry about that.
He doesn't understand.

00:12:54.858 --> 00:12:56.568 position:50% align:center
Didn't mean to do that!

00:12:59.988 --> 00:13:03.408 position:50% align:center
Rumor is, Shinra Kusakabe
will be coming here.

00:13:03.491 --> 00:13:06.911 position:50% align:center
I expect that he'll be going
a few rounds with me.

00:13:11.082 --> 00:13:14.127 position:50% align:center
He is amazingly weak, after all.

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:20.467 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
I appreciate you coming, Shinra.

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:22.302 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Don't mention it.

00:13:22.385 --> 00:13:24.095 position:50% align:center
When you first brought
up the facility,

00:13:24.179 --> 00:13:27.140 position:50% align:center
it made me think of
someone I saw there.

00:13:27.223 --> 00:13:30.810 position:50% align:center
This guy being treated
for severe tephrosis.

00:13:30.894 --> 00:13:34.105 position:50% align:center
I could never forget
what a psycho he was.

00:13:47.243 --> 00:13:48.370 position:50% align:center
[thud]

00:13:50.413 --> 00:13:55.752 position:50% align:center
Stop! Calm down now! Are you
listening to me? You better...

00:13:55.835 --> 00:13:58.880 position:50% align:center
You guys get to
have all the fun.

00:13:58.963 --> 00:14:02.634 position:50% align:center
It's just not fair.
I wanna play, too.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:05.303 position:50% align:center
[LICHT sighs]

00:14:05.387 --> 00:14:07.055 position:50% align:center
That sounds like Kurono to me.

00:14:07.138 --> 00:14:11.351 position:50% align:center
He's got quite a reputation
around that place.

00:14:11.434 --> 00:14:13.353 position:50% align:center
Just like Captain
Shinmon of the 7th

00:14:13.436 --> 00:14:15.814 position:50% align:center
is often referred to
as the "mightiest,"

00:14:15.897 --> 00:14:17.399 position:50% align:center
this Kurono guy seems
to have a lock

00:14:17.482 --> 00:14:20.443 position:50% align:center
on being called the
"maddest" pyrokinetic.

00:14:23.988 --> 00:14:27.033 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] We're here...
Any memories comin' back?

00:14:27.117 --> 00:14:29.452 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Huh? Was this the place?

00:14:29.536 --> 00:14:30.995 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Oh, right.

00:14:31.079 --> 00:14:33.540 position:50% align:center
They do change the locations
of their labs from time to time.

00:14:33.623 --> 00:14:35.291 position:50% align:center
Keeps away those pryin' eyes.

00:14:35.375 --> 00:14:38.128 position:50% align:center
'Cause they know what they're
doing's totally messed up.

00:14:38.211 --> 00:14:39.963 position:50% align:center
Let's go in.

00:14:41.381 --> 00:14:43.091 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Viktor Licht, chief researcher,

00:14:43.174 --> 00:14:45.677 position:50% align:center
applied pyrokinesiology lab.

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:48.096 position:50% align:center
Ah, we've been expecting you.

00:14:53.143 --> 00:14:54.519 position:50% align:center
Have you noticed yet?

00:14:54.602 --> 00:14:56.521 position:50% align:center
What'd you expect?

00:14:56.604 --> 00:14:59.899 position:50% align:center
Of course security's gonna
watch us like hawks.

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:06.448 position:50% align:center
They may as well just say,
"You're not gettin' outta here."

00:15:06.531 --> 00:15:08.408 position:50% align:center
Truth be told,
I'm pretty stoked

00:15:08.491 --> 00:15:10.952 position:50% align:center
about getting to see such
a shady place first-hand.

00:15:11.036 --> 00:15:12.287 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Whoa.

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:13.747 position:50% align:center
Are you sure you should be
saying that out loud?

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:16.207 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm gonna get
killed here anyway.

00:15:16.291 --> 00:15:19.794 position:50% align:center
You won't on my watch.
I promise I'll protect you.

00:15:19.878 --> 00:15:22.339 position:50% align:center
Even though you may
be a Haijima spy,

00:15:22.422 --> 00:15:24.424 position:50% align:center
you've helped me out before.

00:15:24.507 --> 00:15:27.552 position:50% align:center
We definitely would hate to
lose you back at the 8th.

00:15:29.679 --> 00:15:31.514 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Wow, that's nice to hear.

00:15:31.598 --> 00:15:33.016 position:50% align:center
At least I can die happy.

00:15:33.099 --> 00:15:35.894 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Don't even think about it.

00:15:35.977 --> 00:15:37.020 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
What I wouldn't give

00:15:37.103 --> 00:15:39.147 position:50% align:center
for you to have
heard that, Joker.

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:43.193 position:50% align:center
I may have to leave
you for the 8th.

00:15:43.276 --> 00:15:44.944 position:50% align:center
I can't let Joker
be the only one

00:15:45.028 --> 00:15:46.696 position:50% align:center
putting his neck on the line.

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:48.490 position:50% align:center
That's why I wrote
that ridiculous report

00:15:48.573 --> 00:15:52.827 position:50% align:center
to rankle the top brass and
get some juicy dirt on Haijima.

00:15:52.911 --> 00:15:54.788 position:50% align:center
I'm more than willing
to exploit the good will

00:15:54.871 --> 00:15:57.290 position:50% align:center
of the 8th and Shinra

00:15:57.374 --> 00:16:00.502 position:50% align:center
if it means getting my
hands on the truth.

00:16:02.253 --> 00:16:04.631 position:50% align:center
[RESEARCHER C] Welcome to the
pyrokinesis development lab.

00:16:04.714 --> 00:16:07.300 position:50% align:center
We're glad you're here and
the kids will be so happy.

00:16:07.384 --> 00:16:09.511 position:50% align:center
Do you really think those kids
you're torturing in there

00:16:09.594 --> 00:16:10.845 position:50% align:center
are gonna be happy?

00:16:10.929 --> 00:16:14.516 position:50% align:center
I understand. You wanna
meet the children ASAP.

00:16:14.599 --> 00:16:16.309 position:50% align:center
Well, come on in.

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:22.899 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow! He's so funny!

00:16:22.982 --> 00:16:24.651 position:50% align:center
He's great! Hey, I wanna try!

00:16:24.734 --> 00:16:26.152 position:50% align:center
[CHILD C]
Me, too!

00:16:26.236 --> 00:16:28.822 position:50% align:center
So you see, our job
is taking care of kids

00:16:28.905 --> 00:16:31.408 position:50% align:center
who don't know how to
control their abilities.

00:16:31.491 --> 00:16:33.535 position:50% align:center
I requested to visit
with the boy you took in

00:16:33.618 --> 00:16:38.665 position:50% align:center
after the Rekka Hoshimiya
incident, but it was denied.

00:16:38.748 --> 00:16:41.376 position:50% align:center
Is it possible for me
to see how he's doing?

00:16:41.459 --> 00:16:44.212 position:50% align:center
Oh, you must mean Nataku.

00:16:44.295 --> 00:16:46.172 position:50% align:center
Since he's somewhat
of a special case,

00:16:46.256 --> 00:16:48.591 position:50% align:center
he's not at this facility.

00:16:48.675 --> 00:16:50.260 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Hmm.

00:16:51.386 --> 00:16:54.389 position:50% align:center
[NATAKU]
Help me! Someone, please!

00:16:54.472 --> 00:16:56.224 position:50% align:center
An Adolla Link!

00:16:56.307 --> 00:16:59.185 position:50% align:center
[NATAKU]
I wanna go home!

00:16:59.269 --> 00:17:00.937 position:50% align:center
Nataku?

00:17:03.898 --> 00:17:05.608 position:50% align:center
You had one?

00:17:05.692 --> 00:17:08.987 position:50% align:center
Yeah. There's no doubt.

00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:12.657 position:50% align:center
"Not at this facility."
I'm not buying that crap.

00:17:12.741 --> 00:17:16.578 position:50% align:center
He's here. They're hiding
something for sure.

00:17:16.661 --> 00:17:18.830 position:50% align:center
I think we should play
along with them for a while

00:17:18.913 --> 00:17:21.166 position:50% align:center
and see what we can dig up.

00:17:26.546 --> 00:17:28.465 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:17:30.925 --> 00:17:32.427 position:50% align:center
[RESEARCHER C]
Crewman Kusakabe,

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:34.929 position:50% align:center
we appreciate you allowing us
to observe your Adolla Burst.

00:17:35.013 --> 00:17:38.224 position:50% align:center
This will be a simulated battle
test, if you don't mind.

00:17:42.187 --> 00:17:44.898 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Back in a cold,
empty room again.

00:17:44.981 --> 00:17:48.401 position:50% align:center
The whole thing gives me
chills right down to my soul.

00:17:48.485 --> 00:17:51.529 position:50% align:center
They're treating me like a
subject, some kind of lab rat,

00:17:51.613 --> 00:17:53.823 position:50% align:center
stripping away my humanity.

00:17:53.907 --> 00:17:57.535 position:50% align:center
Baring my teeth with
this weird smile.

00:17:58.787 --> 00:18:01.414 position:50% align:center
[buzzing]

00:18:05.043 --> 00:18:07.754 position:50% align:center
[KURONO] I look forward
to working with you today.

00:18:10.131 --> 00:18:12.467 position:50% align:center
[KURONO]
Don't be a waste of my time.

00:18:14.177 --> 00:18:15.887 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
I'll never forget those eyes,

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:18.932 position:50% align:center
or that look of
staring down prey.

00:18:19.015 --> 00:18:21.393 position:50% align:center
I knew he was here.

00:18:21.476 --> 00:18:23.186 position:50% align:center
[KURONO]
I remember you.

00:18:23.269 --> 00:18:25.814 position:50% align:center
I used to see you around
the lab years ago.

00:18:25.897 --> 00:18:29.526 position:50% align:center
I wish I could've played
with you back then.

00:18:29.609 --> 00:18:32.862 position:50% align:center
Now look at you, all grown up.

00:18:32.946 --> 00:18:34.114 position:50% align:center
I wanted to devour you

00:18:34.197 --> 00:18:37.242 position:50% align:center
when you were a scrawny
and clumsy little thing.

00:18:37.325 --> 00:18:39.452 position:50% align:center
Why the hell wouldn't they
let me have a go at you

00:18:39.536 --> 00:18:41.579 position:50% align:center
when you were still a kid?

00:18:43.707 --> 00:18:47.002 position:50% align:center
[KURONO] You're nearly as tall
as I am these days, huh?

00:18:48.128 --> 00:18:53.174 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but I can almost smell
the weakness on you.

00:18:54.718 --> 00:18:58.805 position:50% align:center
Oh. You have the strength
of a grown man.

00:18:58.888 --> 00:19:01.641 position:50% align:center
It's really too bad you couldn't
stay weak and pitiful.

00:19:01.725 --> 00:19:04.394 position:50% align:center
What a shame.

00:19:04.477 --> 00:19:05.603 position:50% align:center
Can I get started?

00:19:05.687 --> 00:19:08.606 position:50% align:center
Of course. Ready, Kusakabe?

00:19:09.858 --> 00:19:12.819 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] I can't wait
to kick this freak's ass.

00:19:14.821 --> 00:19:17.407 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] His tephrosis is
way worse than I imagined.

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:20.493 position:50% align:center
Is that why he's putting out
all that black smoke?

00:19:25.415 --> 00:19:28.043 position:50% align:center
[KURONO]
Right Hand Eclipse.

00:19:30.128 --> 00:19:31.921 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:19:33.465 --> 00:19:35.008 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
What was that?

00:19:35.091 --> 00:19:38.303 position:50% align:center
He kinda swung his fist,
but it didn't land.

00:19:38.386 --> 00:19:40.680 position:50% align:center
He didn't use much
force, either.

00:19:40.764 --> 00:19:43.099 position:50% align:center
Did anything touch me?

00:19:43.183 --> 00:19:48.396 position:50% align:center
As weird as it sounds...
I think it was the smoke.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:51.858 position:50% align:center
I need to figure out what he's
doing so I can counter him.

00:19:51.941 --> 00:19:54.152 position:50% align:center
I can't just keep
taking hits, though.

00:19:54.235 --> 00:19:56.404 position:50% align:center
I'd better use my Rapid!

00:20:02.535 --> 00:20:03.453 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:03.536 --> 00:20:04.954 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
He was able to block that?

00:20:05.038 --> 00:20:06.706 position:50% align:center
Well, how about this?

00:20:14.381 --> 00:20:15.924 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
How can he react to Rapid

00:20:16.007 --> 00:20:18.677 position:50% align:center
if this is the first
time he's seen it?

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:23.556 position:50% align:center
You've been torturing the
children here, haven't you?

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:25.308 position:50% align:center
That ends today!

00:20:25.392 --> 00:20:26.476 position:50% align:center
[RESEARCHER C]
Come on, Shinra,

00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:28.144 position:50% align:center
we need you to show us
that Adolla Burst!

00:20:28.228 --> 00:20:30.188 position:50% align:center
I'll show it to you, all right!

00:20:30.271 --> 00:20:31.564 position:50% align:center
It'll be the last thing you see

00:20:31.648 --> 00:20:33.608 position:50% align:center
when I come over there
and kick your ass!

00:20:33.692 --> 00:20:36.236 position:50% align:center
[RESEARCHER C]
Well, that's terrifying.

00:20:40.031 --> 00:20:42.158 position:50% align:center
What's the deal
with that black smoke?

00:20:42.242 --> 00:20:44.119 position:50% align:center
It's no big secret.

00:20:44.202 --> 00:20:48.415 position:50% align:center
Once I tell you, it still
won't do you any good.

00:20:48.498 --> 00:20:50.625 position:50% align:center
This black smoke links
with my senses,

00:20:50.709 --> 00:20:54.087 position:50% align:center
allowing me to detect the
smallest vibrations in the air.

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:57.340 position:50% align:center
That's how I reacted
to your speed attacks.

00:20:57.424 --> 00:21:01.011 position:50% align:center
You know, throwing weak little
kids around is a lot of fun.

00:21:01.094 --> 00:21:04.097 position:50% align:center
You should see 'em fly.

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:06.141 position:50% align:center
I think you would
get into it, too.

00:21:06.224 --> 00:21:07.684 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:21:07.767 --> 00:21:09.019 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Screw you!

00:21:09.102 --> 00:21:10.812 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] I'll hit him with
so many chained attacks

00:21:10.895 --> 00:21:12.897 position:50% align:center
he won't know what's happening.

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:22.073 position:50% align:center
His firepower grows
with each spin.

00:21:22.157 --> 00:21:24.492 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Let's feakin' go!

00:21:34.252 --> 00:21:36.463 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
His smoke's solidifying.

00:21:43.928 --> 00:21:44.929 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:54.564 --> 00:21:57.067 position:50% align:center
[KURONO]
Eclipse Veil!

00:22:04.199 --> 00:22:06.117 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA groans]

00:22:06.201 --> 00:22:09.454 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Did he concentrate
that smoke to make weapons?

00:22:09.537 --> 00:22:11.623 position:50% align:center
You're not done yet.

00:22:11.706 --> 00:22:12.999 position:50% align:center
Though I would
absolutely love it

00:22:13.083 --> 00:22:15.460 position:50% align:center
if that were all it
took to destroy you.

00:22:15.543 --> 00:22:17.712 position:50% align:center
[RESEARCHER C] Okay, Kurono,
that's enough for today.

00:22:17.796 --> 00:22:19.839 position:50% align:center
We've gotten plenty of data.

00:22:23.343 --> 00:22:25.637 position:50% align:center
Wait a sec, what
the hell's he doing?

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:27.806 position:50% align:center
[OPERATOR B]
Room temperature is rising.

00:22:27.889 --> 00:22:30.100 position:50% align:center
[KURONO] But then,
the more I wear you down,

00:22:30.183 --> 00:22:32.268 position:50% align:center
the more I enjoy this.

00:22:33.311 --> 00:22:38.942 position:50% align:center
Let's keep going.
This will be fun.

00:24:20.126 --> 00:24:22.962 position:50% align:center
[IRIS] Researchers at the lab
rush into the chaotic test site.

00:24:23.046 --> 00:24:24.714 position:50% align:center
And little Nataku has changed?

00:24:24.798 --> 00:24:26.883 position:50% align:center
A strange lady gets
in the way of the 8th.

00:24:26.966 --> 00:24:29.511 position:50% align:center
And to top it off, the
White-Clad show up again!

00:24:29.594 --> 00:24:31.429 position:50% align:center
What else is going to happen?

00:24:31.513 --> 00:24:34.599 position:50% align:center
[NATAKU]
Fire!

00:24:34.683 --> 00:24:36.351 position:50% align:center
[IRIS]
