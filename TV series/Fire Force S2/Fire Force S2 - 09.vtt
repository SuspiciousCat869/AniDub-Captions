00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:32.657 position:50% align:center
[IRIS] Many years ago,
mankind faced a divine fury.

00:00:32.741 --> 00:00:35.410 position:50% align:center
In an event known as
the Day of the Cataclysm,

00:00:35.493 --> 00:00:38.079 position:50% align:center
our entire world was burned.

00:00:38.163 --> 00:00:39.831 position:50% align:center
The fire raged with an intensity

00:00:39.914 --> 00:00:42.542 position:50% align:center
that threatened to
reduce mankind to ash.

00:00:42.625 --> 00:00:45.337 position:50% align:center
The places they lived,
the languages they spoke,

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.425 position:50% align:center
the culture they had built,
none could escape its wrath.

00:00:50.508 --> 00:00:53.261 position:50% align:center
As the world man had built
was buried in ash,

00:00:53.345 --> 00:00:55.555 position:50% align:center
a leader appeared.

00:00:55.638 --> 00:00:59.976 position:50% align:center
A man who would later be
known as Raffles the 1st.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.437 position:50% align:center
Raffles and his disciples
embarked on a quest

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.856 position:50% align:center
to find new light, and they did.

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:07.859 position:50% align:center
What Raffles found was
an unsullied flame.

00:01:07.942 --> 00:01:10.945 position:50% align:center
The spark that would
kindle an empire.

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:19.954 position:50% align:center
[IRIS] Raffles saw at once
that the Unsullied Flame

00:01:20.038 --> 00:01:22.165 position:50% align:center
was a gift from the Great Sol.

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:24.918 position:50% align:center
He resolved to harness
its power with technology

00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:27.796 position:50% align:center
and created Amaterasu.

00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:30.423 position:50% align:center
By the light of
Amaterasu's sacred flame,

00:01:30.507 --> 00:01:32.425 position:50% align:center
the people began to rebuild.

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:33.677 position:50% align:center
With its power,

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.930 position:50% align:center
they established a new
state in the Far East.

00:01:55.615 --> 00:01:57.784 position:50% align:center
Wait, what are you doing?

00:01:57.867 --> 00:01:59.327 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR] You need a word
starting with "A"

00:01:59.411 --> 00:02:01.037 position:50% align:center
for the number one.

00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:03.206 position:50% align:center
"B" for two. And so on.

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:04.749 position:50% align:center
This part of pi goes,

00:02:04.833 --> 00:02:06.918 position:50% align:center
"I'm going to cleave
brigands gallantly."

00:02:07.002 --> 00:02:09.379 position:50% align:center
So, you've memorized pi, huh?

00:02:09.462 --> 00:02:11.256 position:50% align:center
To be honest, I can
barely even believe

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:13.508 position:50% align:center
he's familiar with
the concept of pi.

00:02:13.591 --> 00:02:15.927 position:50% align:center
Take him with a grain of salt.

00:02:16.011 --> 00:02:18.930 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
'Kay... but that said,

00:02:19.014 --> 00:02:22.350 position:50% align:center
it's a crazy-long series of
seemingly random numbers.

00:02:22.434 --> 00:02:26.021 position:50% align:center
I'd say there's a real
possibility that he's right.

00:02:26.104 --> 00:02:28.940 position:50% align:center
Why would you spend your
time memorizing this?

00:02:29.024 --> 00:02:31.651 position:50% align:center
Because it's a coded tale
of the Round Table.

00:02:31.735 --> 00:02:33.987 position:50% align:center
Regarding the exploits
of Sir Cumference.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.282 position:50% align:center
Circumference.
You believe that's a person.

00:02:37.365 --> 00:02:39.284 position:50% align:center
That is so you, Arthur.

00:02:39.367 --> 00:02:39.993 position:50% align:center
Question for you.

00:02:40.076 --> 00:02:41.327 position:50% align:center
[BOTH grunt]

00:02:44.122 --> 00:02:48.168 position:50% align:center
Was pi the horse of Sir
Cumference? Or just his friend?

00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:49.627 position:50% align:center
Do you know?

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.557 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Okay... how can I put this?

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.518 position:50% align:center
Pi is what we call the number
of times the width of a circle

00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:30.020 position:50% align:center
can fit into its perimeter.

00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:33.231 position:50% align:center
It usually gets
shortened to 3.14.

00:04:33.314 --> 00:04:36.067 position:50% align:center
But its precise value
is still under calculation.

00:04:36.151 --> 00:04:39.696 position:50% align:center
It just keeps gettin' longer.

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:41.072 position:50% align:center
I trust you,

00:04:41.156 --> 00:04:42.866 position:50% align:center
but we're dealing with some
high-stakes stuff here,

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:44.451 position:50% align:center
so I'm gonna document
these sequences

00:04:44.534 --> 00:04:46.369 position:50% align:center
and take 'em back to Tokyo.

00:04:46.453 --> 00:04:48.997 position:50% align:center
Just to confirm
that you're right.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.582 position:50% align:center
Do you think these
tablets could be used

00:04:50.665 --> 00:04:52.167 position:50% align:center
to affect the Tabernacle?

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.377 position:50% align:center
Awaken its destructive side?

00:04:54.461 --> 00:04:56.963 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] I have a hard time
seeing how lining up

00:04:57.047 --> 00:04:58.089 position:50% align:center
a bunch of rocks like this

00:04:58.173 --> 00:05:00.342 position:50% align:center
could make this
place go kablooey,

00:05:00.425 --> 00:05:02.844 position:50% align:center
but that doesn't mean
there isn't a real catalyst

00:05:02.927 --> 00:05:04.596 position:50% align:center
somewhere else in here.

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:06.139 position:50% align:center
Let's look around.

00:05:07.432 --> 00:05:11.686 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
That was... another Adolla Link.

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.404 position:50% align:center

She had a devilish smile.

down this demon or not?

Get to work!

00:05:33.583 --> 00:05:34.834 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Right. Sorry.

00:05:34.918 --> 00:05:36.878 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT] They're coming
from this way, too!

00:05:36.961 --> 00:05:38.380 position:50% align:center

We're surrounded, idiot!

00:05:38.463 --> 00:05:41.299 position:50% align:center

Fire-Cat's Tails!

00:05:45.261 --> 00:05:48.181 position:50% align:center
The flame is the soul's breath.

00:05:48.264 --> 00:05:51.768 position:50% align:center
The black smoke is
the soul's release.

00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:53.853 position:50% align:center
Ashes thou wert and art.

00:05:53.937 --> 00:05:56.022 position:50% align:center
May thy soul...

00:05:56.106 --> 00:05:59.401 position:50% align:center
...return to the
great flame of fire.

00:05:59.484 --> 00:06:01.986 position:50% align:center
She started the prayer.
Let's get to it!

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:03.238 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.621 position:50% align:center

00:06:20.714 --> 00:06:22.841 position:50% align:center
Let's take out the trash!

00:06:29.347 --> 00:06:32.017 position:50% align:center
Return to the great
flame of fire.

00:06:36.104 --> 00:06:38.606 position:50% align:center
Yeah, get in there, hero!

[SHINRA]
I'm gonna get help!

[JUGGERNAUT] Don't bother.
This is for the best.

00:07:22.484 --> 00:07:24.903 position:50% align:center
Stop talking like that!
Just hang in there, please!

[JUGGERNAUT]
Oh.

00:07:29.366 --> 00:07:31.326 position:50% align:center

Huh?

00:07:35.038 --> 00:07:37.832 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT]
I sure am glad I bundled up.

00:07:37.916 --> 00:07:39.542 position:50% align:center
I think this goes
past wearing layers!

00:07:39.626 --> 00:07:41.294 position:50% align:center

on in those clothes?!

This time he's dead for sure!

How did you do that?

[JUGGERNAUT] It's a good
thing I'm warmly dressed.

You're kidding.

a basic configuration

00:11:29.689 --> 00:11:31.608 position:50% align:center
Eight, huh?

00:11:32.692 --> 00:11:37.072 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] So then, there's one
for each of the Pillars.

00:11:37.155 --> 00:11:40.784 position:50% align:center
And I know full-well what
those arrows signify.

00:11:42.202 --> 00:11:44.329 position:50% align:center
"Sacrifice."

00:11:45.872 --> 00:11:48.458 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] In old Japan, that kind
of arrow in the roof of a house

00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:50.126 position:50% align:center
meant someone inside
had been chosen

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:53.922 position:50% align:center
as a human pillar--a sacrifice.

00:11:54.005 --> 00:11:58.301 position:50% align:center
This core has a pulse.
Something's alive in there.

00:11:58.385 --> 00:12:01.680 position:50% align:center
If the Tabernacle
and Amaterasu

00:12:01.763 --> 00:12:07.227 position:50% align:center
are both powered
by Adolla Bursts...

00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:09.771 position:50% align:center
...then the results of
Joker's secret investigation

00:12:09.854 --> 00:12:15.235 position:50% align:center
were accurate and the source
of Amaterasu's power...

00:12:15.318 --> 00:12:19.280 position:50% align:center
...is a human being
with an Adolla Burst.

00:12:19.364 --> 00:12:21.157 position:50% align:center
[PAN]
Sacrifice?

00:12:21.241 --> 00:12:22.492 position:50% align:center
Wait, are you saying--?

00:12:22.575 --> 00:12:23.868 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Yeah.

00:12:23.952 --> 00:12:25.787 position:50% align:center
There's a solid chance that
it's the woman in black

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.998 position:50% align:center
Scop and Yata told us about.

00:12:29.082 --> 00:12:32.585 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR] Didn't Scop say they
were waiting for her to return?

00:12:32.669 --> 00:12:36.172 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] True, but I don't think
he knew where she'd gone.

00:12:36.256 --> 00:12:38.717 position:50% align:center
And if she is in there,
that would definitely explain

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.635 position:50% align:center
why Shinra's been
having Adolla Links.

00:12:40.719 --> 00:12:42.721 position:50% align:center
She's calling to him.

00:12:44.889 --> 00:12:47.350 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
You're in there, right?

00:12:47.434 --> 00:12:48.727 position:50% align:center
Are you who I think--?

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:51.855 position:50% align:center
The woman who taught Scop
and the others to talk?

00:12:56.568 --> 00:12:58.820 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
This feels familiar.

00:12:58.903 --> 00:13:02.032 position:50% align:center
It's like the Evangelist,
but strangely gentle.

00:13:02.115 --> 00:13:04.075 position:50% align:center
Soothing even.

00:13:05.368 --> 00:13:07.287 position:50% align:center
Just who are you?

00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:27.682 position:50% align:center
Uh, hey, Shinra!

00:13:34.356 --> 00:13:35.815 position:50% align:center
Not to interrupt your
daydreamin', bro,

00:13:35.899 --> 00:13:37.150 position:50% align:center
but I could really
use a hand here!

00:13:37.233 --> 00:13:39.152 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Sorry, but I need
you to buy me some time.

00:13:39.235 --> 00:13:41.780 position:50% align:center
If this works, I might be able
to put that demon to rest.

00:13:41.863 --> 00:13:42.530 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:13:42.614 --> 00:13:44.115 position:50% align:center
Trust me.

00:13:46.326 --> 00:13:49.037 position:50% align:center
Talk to me!
Scop told me about you!

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.998 position:50% align:center
It was you that brought this
place back to life, right?

00:13:54.167 --> 00:13:57.879 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] If so, I'm hoping
you can hand out Grace.

00:13:57.962 --> 00:13:59.923 position:50% align:center
Just like the Evangelist does.

00:14:00.006 --> 00:14:01.466 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:14:01.549 --> 00:14:04.844 position:50% align:center
Don't know what that means,
but yeah, I can buy some time.

00:14:04.928 --> 00:14:07.097 position:50% align:center
Ogun, do you want me to help?

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:10.809 position:50% align:center
[OGUN] Nah. I can
handle this by myself.

00:14:20.026 --> 00:14:22.654 position:50% align:center
Let's crank up the heat!

00:14:23.655 --> 00:14:26.449 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:14:26.533 --> 00:14:29.911 position:50% align:center
Now! Flamy Ink!

00:14:33.498 --> 00:14:35.500 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:14:39.295 --> 00:14:43.591 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:14:50.682 --> 00:14:52.100 position:50% align:center
If all you need is more time...

00:14:52.183 --> 00:14:53.810 position:50% align:center
[OGUN yells]

00:14:57.105 --> 00:15:00.108 position:50% align:center
[OGUN] ...then I'm damn
sure I can keep him busy.

00:15:00.191 --> 00:15:03.361 position:50% align:center
I'll keep chaining combos
till you can tag in.

00:15:05.488 --> 00:15:08.450 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT]
Wow. He's so strong.

00:15:08.533 --> 00:15:12.120 position:50% align:center
I get it now. The rumors
I heard were about Ogun.

00:15:12.203 --> 00:15:14.164 position:50% align:center
People say that the 4th
has a new recruit

00:15:14.247 --> 00:15:17.792 position:50% align:center
who can temporarily generate
as much heat as Captain Burns.

00:15:17.876 --> 00:15:21.796 position:50% align:center
[OGUN]
Dam, dam, dam, dam...!

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:23.548 position:50% align:center
It's amazing to see,

00:15:23.631 --> 00:15:25.342 position:50% align:center
but I can't really make
heads or tails of it.

00:15:25.425 --> 00:15:27.344 position:50% align:center
I mean, just what is he doing?

00:15:27.427 --> 00:15:30.263 position:50% align:center
Unless the rumors are wrong,
those bands of flame on his skin

00:15:30.347 --> 00:15:32.891 position:50% align:center
allow him to ramp up
his physical strength.

00:15:32.974 --> 00:15:34.809 position:50% align:center
The only downside is
that it can eventually

00:15:34.893 --> 00:15:36.394 position:50% align:center
cause him to overheat.

00:15:36.478 --> 00:15:37.771 position:50% align:center
But...

00:15:37.854 --> 00:15:40.315 position:50% align:center
I wonder, how long
can he do this?

00:15:40.398 --> 00:15:42.192 position:50% align:center
I wish I could do
something to help.

00:15:42.275 --> 00:15:45.278 position:50% align:center
But when I look at how
quickly he's moving,

00:15:45.362 --> 00:15:48.281 position:50% align:center
I feel like I'd just get
in the way if I tried.

00:15:50.325 --> 00:15:54.621 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:15:59.542 --> 00:16:04.464 position:50% align:center

00:16:17.811 --> 00:16:20.146 position:50% align:center

You slippery little--

00:16:21.856 --> 00:16:26.861 position:50% align:center
[yelling]

00:16:32.325 --> 00:16:36.871 position:50% align:center

[growls]

00:16:44.504 --> 00:16:46.840 position:50% align:center
Ogun.

00:16:46.923 --> 00:16:49.384 position:50% align:center
[TEMPE] You're persistent,
I'll give you that,

00:16:49.467 --> 00:16:52.262 position:50% align:center
but it's time I showed you
the difference in our power.

00:16:52.345 --> 00:16:54.347 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
Hey! You're up against me, too!

00:16:54.431 --> 00:16:54.806 position:50% align:center
Tamaki!

00:16:54.889 --> 00:16:56.349 position:50% align:center
Nekomata!

00:16:56.433 --> 00:16:58.393 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:17:00.103 --> 00:17:04.065 position:50% align:center
Get ready, Juggernaut!
I need your help!

00:17:04.149 --> 00:17:06.568 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT]
Huh? Ah!

00:17:06.651 --> 00:17:08.820 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI] This'll only work
if we fight together!

00:17:08.903 --> 00:17:09.988 position:50% align:center
[OGUN]
No, get back!

00:17:10.071 --> 00:17:11.364 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:17:11.448 --> 00:17:13.616 position:50% align:center
[TEMPE] You have no
hope of defeating me.

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:15.326 position:50% align:center
I realize that!

00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:17.037 position:50% align:center
But with Juggernaut's help,

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:20.415 position:50% align:center
I can make your day
go from bad to worse!

00:17:20.498 --> 00:17:21.541 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT]
Oh, no.

00:17:21.624 --> 00:17:23.626 position:50% align:center
Oh, no, he's coming!

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:27.047 position:50% align:center
Get away from me!

00:17:31.509 --> 00:17:34.179 position:50% align:center
Hey! Stop trashin' my forest!

00:17:34.262 --> 00:17:36.431 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT]
Uh. Sorry!

00:17:37.682 --> 00:17:38.808 position:50% align:center
[OGUN]
Heh.

00:17:38.892 --> 00:17:40.226 position:50% align:center
Nice work.

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:42.979 position:50% align:center
If you don't cool off,
you'll get tephrosis!

00:17:43.063 --> 00:17:45.357 position:50% align:center
Nah, I'll be just fine.

00:17:47.567 --> 00:17:51.905 position:50% align:center
[OGUN] In fact...
I'mma crank it up even more!

00:17:51.988 --> 00:17:53.865 position:50% align:center
Take this!

00:17:59.162 --> 00:18:00.914 position:50% align:center
[OGUN]
Ogun's racin' across the court!

00:18:00.997 --> 00:18:02.832 position:50% align:center
The ball's burnin' in his hands!

00:18:02.916 --> 00:18:08.922 position:50% align:center
He lobs it up and... slams!

00:18:09.005 --> 00:18:10.715 position:50% align:center
[TEMPE groans]

00:18:16.137 --> 00:18:17.305 position:50% align:center

How's it comin,' Shinra?

00:18:52.382 --> 00:18:55.093 position:50% align:center
I'm bustin' my ass, but I
can't keep this up forever.

00:18:55.176 --> 00:18:57.846 position:50% align:center
Whatever it is you're plannin',
you need to make it happen fast!

00:18:57.929 --> 00:18:59.639 position:50% align:center
Uh. Right!

00:18:59.723 --> 00:19:02.017 position:50% align:center
[TEMPE] You should stop
pressing your luck.

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:05.645 position:50% align:center
Unless you're ready
to die, that is.

00:19:09.941 --> 00:19:11.401 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:19:11.484 --> 00:19:13.069 position:50% align:center
Take this!

00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:22.245 position:50% align:center
[groaning]

00:19:22.328 --> 00:19:23.872 position:50% align:center
[OGUN]
You like that?

00:19:26.166 --> 00:19:30.086 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Come on! I know
you're there! Just answer!

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:32.047 position:50% align:center
Scop and the others
are waiting for you!

00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:33.840 position:50% align:center
[SCOP]
Hey, who are you talkin' to?

00:19:33.923 --> 00:19:35.967 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me you found <i>her</i> .

00:19:36.051 --> 00:19:38.303 position:50% align:center
Yeah. The woman
who gave you fire,

00:19:38.386 --> 00:19:40.972 position:50% align:center
she's operating the
Tabernacle from inside.

00:19:41.056 --> 00:19:42.265 position:50% align:center
You think she's in there?

00:19:42.349 --> 00:19:44.392 position:50% align:center
If that's true, then she's
been burning herself

00:19:44.476 --> 00:19:47.354 position:50% align:center
to keep the forest
alive this whole time.

00:19:47.437 --> 00:19:49.481 position:50% align:center
You should call her out, too.

00:19:49.564 --> 00:19:51.399 position:50% align:center
I think I can get rid
of that demon,

00:19:51.483 --> 00:19:53.443 position:50% align:center
but I'm gonna need
her power to do it.

00:19:53.526 --> 00:19:55.278 position:50% align:center
[SCOP]
Hm.

00:19:56.363 --> 00:19:58.406 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] When you brought
life to this wasteland,

00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:00.367 position:50% align:center
you worked a miracle!

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:01.910 position:50% align:center
You've been
protecting the forest

00:20:01.993 --> 00:20:03.953 position:50% align:center
and the animals
inside it, right?

00:20:04.037 --> 00:20:06.498 position:50% align:center
Well, I wanna protect them, too!

00:20:08.416 --> 00:20:10.168 position:50% align:center
Shinra.

00:20:16.466 --> 00:20:18.635 position:50% align:center
This wouldn't be the first
time you've saved me!

00:20:18.718 --> 00:20:21.262 position:50% align:center
Fact is, my friends and I
owe you our lives and more!

00:20:21.346 --> 00:20:24.599 position:50% align:center
But even so, I'm begging
you to help us again!

00:20:39.114 --> 00:20:41.991 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN IN BLACK]
I hear your plea,

00:20:42.075 --> 00:20:46.287 position:50% align:center
and I would help... if I could.

00:20:46.371 --> 00:20:47.831 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA gasps]

00:20:47.914 --> 00:20:55.588 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN IN BLACK] However...
my power is... all but depleted.

00:20:55.672 --> 00:21:01.803 position:50% align:center
I only have enough left...
to sustain the forest.

00:21:07.559 --> 00:21:10.311 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN IN BLACK]
Perhaps...

00:21:10.395 --> 00:21:16.151 position:50% align:center
...I could lend you a shred
of Adolla's Grace,

00:21:16.234 --> 00:21:22.615 position:50% align:center
but it would be... far too
little to make a difference.

00:21:23.992 --> 00:21:28.204 position:50% align:center
Hang on, I think I might
need less than you think.

00:21:29.581 --> 00:21:31.916 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN IN BLACK]
No.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.211 position:50% align:center
As I am now,

00:21:35.295 --> 00:21:42.093 position:50% align:center
if I lent you Grace, it would
last for... but a second.

00:21:45.055 --> 00:21:48.808 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN IN BLACK] What could
you do in a single second?

00:21:51.186 --> 00:21:55.774 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN IN BLACK]
Such a trifling gift would be...

00:21:55.857 --> 00:21:57.692 position:50% align:center
...useless.

00:22:03.031 --> 00:22:06.826 position:50% align:center
That's all? One second?

00:22:10.622 --> 00:22:14.459 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN IN BLACK]
I am so sorry.

00:22:14.542 --> 00:22:19.756 position:50% align:center
I wish I... could've helped you.

00:22:37.732 --> 00:22:40.568 position:50% align:center
One second is all
the time I need.

00:24:21.628 --> 00:24:24.172 position:50% align:center
