00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:32.866 position:50% align:center
[IRIS] Many years ago,
mankind faced a divine fury.

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:35.577 position:50% align:center
In an event known as the
"Day of the Cataclysm,"

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.288 position:50% align:center
our entire world was burned.

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:40.081 position:50% align:center
The fire raged with an intensity

00:00:40.165 --> 00:00:42.751 position:50% align:center
that threatened to
reduce mankind to ash.

00:00:42.834 --> 00:00:45.587 position:50% align:center
The places they lived,
the languages they spoke,

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.633 position:50% align:center
the culture they had built--
none could escape its wrath.

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:53.470 position:50% align:center
As the world man had built
was buried in ash,

00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:55.764 position:50% align:center
a leader appeared.

00:00:55.847 --> 00:01:00.143 position:50% align:center
A man who would later be
known as Raffles the 1st.

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:02.604 position:50% align:center
Raffles and his disciples
embarked on a quest

00:01:02.687 --> 00:01:05.023 position:50% align:center
to find new light, and they did.

00:01:05.106 --> 00:01:08.068 position:50% align:center
What Raffles found was
an unsullied flame.

00:01:08.151 --> 00:01:11.112 position:50% align:center
The spark that would
kindle an Empire.

00:01:17.786 --> 00:01:20.205 position:50% align:center
[IRIS] Raffles saw at once
that the unsullied flame

00:01:20.288 --> 00:01:22.332 position:50% align:center
was a gift from the Great Sol.

00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:25.126 position:50% align:center
He resolved to harness
its power with technology

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.004 position:50% align:center
and created Amaterasu.

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:30.674 position:50% align:center
By the light of Amaterasu's
sacred flame,

00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:32.592 position:50% align:center
the people began to rebuild.

00:01:32.676 --> 00:01:37.138 position:50% align:center
With its power, they established
a new state in the Far East.

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:08.837 position:50% align:center
[HEBIO] Crewman Shinra,
I'm Lieutenant Hebio.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.755 position:50% align:center
Thanks for joining us.

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:12.757 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Happy to be of service.

00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:15.635 position:50% align:center
[HEBIO] Word is, you have some
experience in the Nether.

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:17.387 position:50% align:center
We'll be counting on you.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.805 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Yes, sir.

00:02:22.183 --> 00:02:25.186 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] The 8th has never split
up for a mission like this.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.024 position:50% align:center
Not sure putting Arthur on
another squad is a great idea.

00:02:29.107 --> 00:02:31.484 position:50% align:center
Hope those tips I gave
them will be enough.

00:02:31.568 --> 00:02:33.820 position:50% align:center
Harken to my voice, gentlemen!

00:02:33.903 --> 00:02:36.448 position:50% align:center
I am Arthur Boyle
the Knight King!

00:02:36.531 --> 00:02:38.116 position:50% align:center
You will heed my commands!

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:39.909 position:50% align:center
[HECKLER]
I'm runnin' this squad!

00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:41.244 position:50% align:center
What?

00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:43.621 position:50% align:center
Stop all your babbling.
And bow your foolish head!

00:02:43.705 --> 00:02:45.498 position:50% align:center
[HECKLER]
What did you say?

00:02:45.582 --> 00:02:47.208 position:50% align:center
[2ND CREWMAN A]
Lieutenant Heckler, sir!

00:02:47.292 --> 00:02:48.501 position:50% align:center
According to Company 8's

00:02:48.585 --> 00:02:50.879 position:50% align:center
"Care and Feeding for
Arthur Boyle" manual,

00:02:50.962 --> 00:02:53.256 position:50% align:center
if you just humor his
delusions and play along,

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.383 position:50% align:center
he'll probably comply
to some degree.

00:02:55.467 --> 00:02:58.428 position:50% align:center
[HECKLER grunts, sighs]

00:02:58.511 --> 00:03:01.765 position:50% align:center
[HECKLER] King Arthur,
I, uh, Knight Heckler

00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:04.225 position:50% align:center
have been granted the title
"Head of the Order."

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:06.853 position:50% align:center
Very well. You may take command.

00:03:06.936 --> 00:03:10.774 position:50% align:center
[ENGO] Lieutenant Hinawa, very
glad to have you along today.

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:14.152 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA] I'm happy to be of
assistance in any way I can.

00:03:14.235 --> 00:03:15.695 position:50% align:center
[2ND CREWMAN B]
Hey, what are you doing?

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:18.365 position:50% align:center
[TAKIGI] I'm joining this
mission, so let me through!

00:03:18.448 --> 00:03:22.535 position:50% align:center
Takigi Oze, CID. Here to
assist in this operation.

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:24.829 position:50% align:center
Are you sure that you're
in the condition to join?

00:03:24.913 --> 00:03:28.291 position:50% align:center
Yes, I'm sure!
I won't slow you down.

00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:31.419 position:50% align:center
I need to see this
investigation to the end.

00:03:31.503 --> 00:03:32.545 position:50% align:center
That's fine.

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:34.255 position:50% align:center
You're Lieutenant
Hinawa, aren't you?

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:35.840 position:50% align:center
The one who tricked Maki.

00:03:35.924 --> 00:03:37.842 position:50% align:center
Tricked her?

00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:39.636 position:50% align:center
I offer you personal protection

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:41.054 position:50% align:center
so you can focus
on your invest--

00:03:41.137 --> 00:03:43.056 position:50% align:center
[TAKIGI]
I may not be a Fire Soldier,

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:45.433 position:50% align:center
but I can handle myself!

00:03:48.937 --> 00:03:51.398 position:50% align:center
Still, wear this turnout coat.

00:03:52.857 --> 00:03:54.442 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:03:56.444 --> 00:03:58.780 position:50% align:center
We're gonna lean on your
experience down there.

00:03:58.863 --> 00:04:01.199 position:50% align:center
I'll do my best to help, sir.

00:04:05.662 --> 00:04:08.331 position:50% align:center
Okay! We're goin' in!

00:04:19.718 --> 00:04:21.011 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI groans]

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:26.433 position:50% align:center
A dead shopping mall in
the Nether? It's so creepy.

00:04:26.516 --> 00:04:29.144 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT] Yes! I'm on
the same squad as her!

00:04:29.227 --> 00:04:31.646 position:50% align:center
You're being weirdly
calm today, Juggernaut.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.314 position:50% align:center
We're in the Nether, you know.

00:04:33.398 --> 00:04:35.358 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT]
Uh! Yeah, well, uh.

00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:38.153 position:50% align:center
I grew up out in the boonies
where it was always dark,

00:04:38.236 --> 00:04:40.739 position:50% align:center
so this kinda stuff
doesn't really bother me.

00:04:40.822 --> 00:04:42.907 position:50% align:center
It doesn't, huh?

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:45.410 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT gasps]

00:04:45.493 --> 00:04:47.328 position:50% align:center
Well, it's a little
too dark for me.

00:04:47.412 --> 00:04:48.580 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT]
Oh my gosh!

00:04:48.663 --> 00:04:51.166 position:50% align:center
Kotatsu is holding on to me!

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:54.669 position:50% align:center
Why'd I have to wear
so many freakin' layers?

00:04:54.753 --> 00:04:55.754 position:50% align:center
[HAJIKI]
Huh?

00:04:55.837 --> 00:04:57.339 position:50% align:center
Juggernaut, is this
the same Kotatsu

00:04:57.422 --> 00:04:59.049 position:50% align:center
that you're always
goin' on about?

00:04:59.132 --> 00:05:00.842 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT]
Now, h-hold on, Hajiki!

00:05:00.925 --> 00:05:02.886 position:50% align:center
[HAJIKI] First Class Fire
Soldier of the 2nd,

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:05.138 position:50% align:center
Platoon Leader Hajiki.

00:05:07.223 --> 00:05:11.061 position:50% align:center
I'm forgetful, but please
don't hold that against me.

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:12.062 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI squeals]

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:13.229 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT]
What the heck, sir?

00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:15.398 position:50% align:center
Please be respectful
to our team member!

00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:17.942 position:50% align:center
[HAJIKI]
What? Oh, did I do that?

00:05:18.026 --> 00:05:21.237 position:50% align:center
Ugh, my Lucky Lecher
Lure strikes again!

00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:24.657 position:50% align:center
What's going on here?
Why is she undressed?

00:05:24.741 --> 00:05:26.493 position:50% align:center
Did I lose my memory?

00:05:26.576 --> 00:05:28.745 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT] Hajiki,
I'm surprised and appalled!

00:05:28.828 --> 00:05:30.497 position:50% align:center
[HAJIKI] I really don't
know what happened.

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.291 position:50% align:center
Like I lost my head for
a second or something.

00:05:33.375 --> 00:05:34.501 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI wailing]

00:05:34.584 --> 00:05:37.337 position:50% align:center
Weird. Guess there's
no hospital down here.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:38.588 position:50% align:center
[KAGENASHI SQUAD yells]

00:05:38.672 --> 00:05:40.882 position:50% align:center
--Holy--! What was that?
--[TAMAKI] An explosion?

00:05:40.965 --> 00:05:43.885 position:50% align:center
That came outta nowhere!

00:05:43.968 --> 00:05:46.930 position:50% align:center
[2ND CREWMAN C]
Medic! We need a medic!

00:05:50.475 --> 00:05:52.936 position:50% align:center
You get your thermal
sensors all set up?

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:54.938 position:50% align:center
That was the last one.

00:05:55.021 --> 00:06:00.360 position:50% align:center
Oh, man. Kinda feel like I'm
in a zombie movie right now.

00:06:00.443 --> 00:06:01.695 position:50% align:center
Lieutenant Ohana!

00:06:01.778 --> 00:06:02.862 position:50% align:center
Yeah, what?

00:06:02.946 --> 00:06:04.948 position:50% align:center
We need you over here!

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:08.618 position:50% align:center
[OHANA gasps]

00:06:08.702 --> 00:06:10.286 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Aww...

00:06:16.126 --> 00:06:17.961 position:50% align:center
There are Infernals
in the Nether?

00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:20.213 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
How can there be so many?

00:06:25.051 --> 00:06:25.677 position:50% align:center
Oh, no!

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.804 position:50% align:center
[2ND CREWMAN E screams]

00:06:30.432 --> 00:06:32.058 position:50% align:center
[RITSU]
I love the Nether.

00:06:32.142 --> 00:06:35.270 position:50% align:center
The Great Cataclysm has turned
it into a treasure trove--

00:06:35.353 --> 00:06:37.981 position:50% align:center
full of dead bodies.

00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:40.442 position:50% align:center
There are many who
serve the Evangelist.

00:06:40.525 --> 00:06:43.695 position:50% align:center
You know the Knights
of the Ashen Flame...

00:06:43.778 --> 00:06:47.699 position:50% align:center
We're the Knights
of the Purple Haze.

00:06:51.286 --> 00:06:53.955 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:08:29.676 --> 00:08:31.261 position:50% align:center
Ashes thou wert and art.

00:08:31.344 --> 00:08:35.765 position:50% align:center
May thy soul return...
to the great flame of fire.

<i>Látom.</i>

00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:44.107 position:50% align:center
Hey, Natasha, once this
next mission is over,

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:45.567 position:50% align:center
let's get married.

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:50.739 position:50% align:center
Jonas. Do you mean it? Oh, yes!

00:08:50.822 --> 00:08:52.032 position:50% align:center
[JONAS gasps, yells]

00:08:52.115 --> 00:08:53.700 position:50% align:center
Jonas, no!

00:08:56.369 --> 00:08:59.748 position:50% align:center
[2ND CREWMAN F]
Those bastards got to Jonas!

00:08:59.831 --> 00:09:01.374 position:50% align:center
No!

00:09:02.667 --> 00:09:05.879 position:50% align:center
I'll be home for the baby;
wouldn't miss it for the world.

00:09:05.962 --> 00:09:08.048 position:50% align:center
[ANTON'S WIFE]
He'll be brave and handsome.

00:09:08.131 --> 00:09:10.258 position:50% align:center
Just like you, Anton.

00:09:11.676 --> 00:09:13.386 position:50% align:center
[2ND CREWMAN F]
Anton!

00:09:14.929 --> 00:09:16.806 position:50% align:center
Damn you!

00:09:18.266 --> 00:09:20.268 position:50% align:center
When I get back
from this mission,

00:09:20.352 --> 00:09:23.688 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna show everybody
my brand-new kicks.

00:09:30.236 --> 00:09:31.780 position:50% align:center
Hey, crewman! Watch yourself!

00:09:31.863 --> 00:09:33.156 position:50% align:center
[2ND CREWMAN F] My life
flashed before my eyes

00:09:33.239 --> 00:09:35.575 position:50% align:center
and it was pathetic,
so I'll be fine.

00:09:41.831 --> 00:09:44.584 position:50% align:center
Anton... why?

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.468 position:50% align:center

00:10:00.892 --> 00:10:03.895 position:50% align:center
Those are the dead Fire
Soldiers attacking us!

00:10:03.978 --> 00:10:06.606 position:50% align:center
It's gotta be that one
White-Clad we fought at Haijima.

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:09.609 position:50% align:center
She had the power
to control corpses.

00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:14.989 position:50% align:center
[OHANA] I'll just have
to stop her, then!

00:10:18.118 --> 00:10:19.494 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Uh.

00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:27.252 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:30.046 position:50% align:center
Aw, come on!

Somebody from the 8th,
please help me!

[RITSU giggles]

00:10:37.429 --> 00:10:44.269 position:50% align:center

crewmen. Kill your friends.

Let go of me! I don't wanna die!

Juggernaut!

00:10:47.689 --> 00:10:50.400 position:50% align:center
Ah, jeez. At least
I'm here to bail you out.

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:55.488 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT]
What's the big idea?

00:10:55.572 --> 00:10:57.657 position:50% align:center
You could've filled me full
of holes, you know?

00:10:57.741 --> 00:11:00.577 position:50% align:center
I'm just glad I had all these
layers on to protect me!

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:03.371 position:50% align:center
[HAJIKI] Relax, man. I know
what's what inside there.

00:11:03.455 --> 00:11:04.998 position:50% align:center
You always lean a bit
to the left anyway.

00:11:05.081 --> 00:11:06.791 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT]
No! To the right!

00:11:06.875 --> 00:11:09.502 position:50% align:center
Your forgetfulness
almost got me killed!

00:11:09.586 --> 00:11:12.422 position:50% align:center
All those bullets and
not a single one hit you?

00:11:12.505 --> 00:11:13.631 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT] Well, it
would've been pretty tough

00:11:13.715 --> 00:11:16.051 position:50% align:center
to get through to me
with all these layers.

00:11:16.134 --> 00:11:17.427 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:11:20.263 --> 00:11:23.099 position:50% align:center
All right, guys, both of
you need to stay behind me.

00:11:23.183 --> 00:11:26.353 position:50% align:center
Start the prayer, if you would,
Crewman Kotatsu.

00:11:26.436 --> 00:11:27.520 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:11:38.323 --> 00:11:41.368 position:50% align:center
Look out, Hajiki! Behind you!

00:11:45.663 --> 00:11:48.083 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow! He's a great shot!

00:11:48.166 --> 00:11:51.294 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT] Beautiful, right?
I wish I had those skills.

00:11:51.378 --> 00:11:54.964 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it's incredible. How does
he make it look so easy?

00:11:55.048 --> 00:11:57.842 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT] As far as I know,
he's always been this good.

00:11:57.926 --> 00:11:59.636 position:50% align:center
I mean, he was the unpowered MVP

00:11:59.719 --> 00:12:02.055 position:50% align:center
at the Rookie Games five
years ago, after all.

00:12:02.138 --> 00:12:04.140 position:50% align:center
Huh? Hajiki's unpowered?

00:12:04.224 --> 00:12:08.186 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT] Well...
his memory is not very good.

00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:10.271 position:50% align:center
Apparently, he just
forgot about his ability

00:12:10.355 --> 00:12:12.399 position:50% align:center
when he applied to participate.

00:12:12.482 --> 00:12:16.403 position:50% align:center
It's is in his eyes.
He's got like, super vision.

00:12:18.363 --> 00:12:20.990 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT] He can see the heat
that radiates from everything,

00:12:21.074 --> 00:12:23.076 position:50% align:center
like a human thermal scope.

00:12:23.159 --> 00:12:25.870 position:50% align:center
He can even see targets
through walls and stuff.

00:12:25.954 --> 00:12:28.373 position:50% align:center
Apparently, at that
year's Rookie Games,

00:12:28.456 --> 00:12:30.750 position:50% align:center
he went straight to the goal.

00:12:30.834 --> 00:12:33.128 position:50% align:center
[INSTRUCTOR A] Get past the
obstacles, rescue anyone,

00:12:33.211 --> 00:12:36.423 position:50% align:center
and be the first to reach the
crewman posing as an Infernal.

00:12:36.506 --> 00:12:38.675 position:50% align:center
[HAJIKI]
Up there on the fourth floor.

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:45.598 position:50% align:center
Explains what happened with you.

00:12:45.682 --> 00:12:47.434 position:50% align:center
How he could fire so many rounds

00:12:47.517 --> 00:12:49.352 position:50% align:center
and still not fill
you full of holes.

00:12:49.436 --> 00:12:51.938 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT] Yup, he can see
through all of my layers,

00:12:52.022 --> 00:12:54.858 position:50% align:center
so it's hard not be
self-conscious around him.

00:13:16.004 --> 00:13:17.213 position:50% align:center
[HAJIKI]
Well, that's that.

00:13:17.297 --> 00:13:20.592 position:50% align:center
Infernals have
been extinguished.

00:13:20.675 --> 00:13:22.177 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT]
You saved our lives!

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.722 position:50% align:center
Did I mention how happy
I am to be on your squad?

00:13:25.805 --> 00:13:27.098 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
Platoon Leader Hajiki.

00:13:27.182 --> 00:13:28.433 position:50% align:center
That was incredible!

00:13:28.516 --> 00:13:29.768 position:50% align:center
Can you use your ability to see

00:13:29.851 --> 00:13:32.812 position:50% align:center
where the other squads
and crewmen are right now?

00:13:32.896 --> 00:13:34.064 position:50% align:center
[HAJIKI]
I sure can.

00:13:34.147 --> 00:13:36.024 position:50% align:center
Let's go join back up with them.

00:13:36.107 --> 00:13:37.359 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:39.652 --> 00:13:41.279 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT]
A White-Clad!

00:13:41.363 --> 00:13:43.239 position:50% align:center
Wait, stay right there.

00:13:46.368 --> 00:13:47.660 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:56.753 --> 00:13:58.004 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:02.634 --> 00:14:05.428 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT screaming]

00:14:05.512 --> 00:14:08.431 position:50% align:center
[OROCHI] I am Orochi,
a Knight of the Purple Haze,

00:14:08.515 --> 00:14:11.142 position:50% align:center
known as "she who tears
her foes asunder."

00:14:11.226 --> 00:14:15.438 position:50% align:center
Cease your lamentations, for
you will be joining him soon.

00:14:17.148 --> 00:14:18.983 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT]
This can't be happening!

00:14:19.067 --> 00:14:21.820 position:50% align:center
Hajiki. His head just--

00:14:21.903 --> 00:14:23.405 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
This is bad.

00:14:23.488 --> 00:14:26.074 position:50% align:center
Juggernaut's gone
into total panic mode.

00:14:26.157 --> 00:14:28.618 position:50% align:center
It's up to me to do something.

00:14:32.455 --> 00:14:34.124 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI] Platoon Leader
Hajiki got taken out

00:14:34.207 --> 00:14:36.001 position:50% align:center
in the blink of an eye.

00:14:37.794 --> 00:14:40.964 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI] How'd she do it?
I didn't see her weapon.

00:14:41.047 --> 00:14:43.091 position:50% align:center
He had superhuman vision,

00:14:43.174 --> 00:14:45.969 position:50% align:center
and if he couldn't
avoid her attack...

00:14:46.052 --> 00:14:48.555 position:50% align:center
...then I don't have
a snowball's chance.

00:14:48.638 --> 00:14:50.515 position:50% align:center
But if she hit him
with a flame attack,

00:14:50.598 --> 00:14:53.768 position:50% align:center
I may be able to withstand it
thanks my resistance to fire.

00:14:53.852 --> 00:14:55.478 position:50% align:center
It's my only hope.

00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:59.899 position:50% align:center
[OROCHI]
Ah. The plot thickens.

00:15:04.612 --> 00:15:07.157 position:50% align:center
[OROCHI]
But how long can you last?

00:15:13.955 --> 00:15:15.331 position:50% align:center
[OROCHI]
How fascinating.

00:15:15.415 --> 00:15:17.542 position:50% align:center
I'm putting tremendous
force into every strike,

00:15:17.625 --> 00:15:19.085 position:50% align:center
but they're simply bouncing off,

00:15:19.169 --> 00:15:22.255 position:50% align:center
as though I'm attacking
a rubber ball.

00:15:22.339 --> 00:15:23.631 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI yells]

00:15:25.425 --> 00:15:27.344 position:50% align:center
[OROCHI] I suppose I'll
have to run you through.

00:15:27.427 --> 00:15:30.263 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI sceams]

00:15:30.347 --> 00:15:31.681 position:50% align:center
[OROCHI]
It's just a matter of time

00:15:31.765 --> 00:15:33.933 position:50% align:center
before I hollow
out your insides.

00:15:34.017 --> 00:15:35.518 position:50% align:center
Your seeming resistance to flame

00:15:35.602 --> 00:15:38.563 position:50% align:center
only means you'll
end up suffering more.

00:15:38.646 --> 00:15:41.316 position:50% align:center
But it will be over soon.

00:15:41.399 --> 00:15:42.984 position:50% align:center
If you end up needing
to be saved,

00:15:43.068 --> 00:15:45.487 position:50% align:center
call for me and I'll come.

00:15:47.113 --> 00:15:49.449 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
Kusakabe.

00:15:52.327 --> 00:15:54.621 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
Help me...

00:15:57.582 --> 00:15:59.751 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
...hero.

00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:29.948 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
Two?

00:16:31.866 --> 00:16:33.451 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT]
You!

00:16:45.171 --> 00:16:46.381 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:57.267 --> 00:16:58.309 position:50% align:center
[whimpering]

00:16:58.393 --> 00:16:58.935 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:16:59.019 --> 00:17:00.562 position:50% align:center
Fire! Help me!

00:17:00.645 --> 00:17:02.022 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:17:02.105 --> 00:17:04.482 position:50% align:center
Are you really that afraid
of this lighter's flame?

00:17:04.566 --> 00:17:05.650 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT]
If you're scared of something,

00:17:05.734 --> 00:17:07.819 position:50% align:center
it doesn't matter
how small it is!

00:17:07.902 --> 00:17:10.655 position:50% align:center
[HAJIKI] Even considering
how big you are?

00:17:13.366 --> 00:17:14.576 position:50% align:center
The ladies won't
see you as a hero

00:17:14.659 --> 00:17:16.745 position:50% align:center
if you act like a scaredy-cat.

00:17:16.828 --> 00:17:18.329 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:17:18.413 --> 00:17:20.707 position:50% align:center
Come on, like a girl would ever
give me a second look anyway.

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:24.002 position:50% align:center
Ugh. Have some
faith in yourself.

00:17:24.085 --> 00:17:27.505 position:50% align:center
You have an incredible amount
of firepower inside of you, man.

00:17:27.589 --> 00:17:31.009 position:50% align:center
Somewhere in there, there's
courage that matches your size.

00:17:33.261 --> 00:17:36.014 position:50% align:center
[HAJIKI] So don't be afraid
of a little flame.

00:17:36.973 --> 00:17:39.059 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT]
I'm sorry, Hajiki.

00:17:39.142 --> 00:17:42.228 position:50% align:center
I've been such a
pathetic little baby.

00:17:42.312 --> 00:17:45.899 position:50% align:center
I have to stop whining about
everything all the time.

00:17:45.982 --> 00:17:48.943 position:50% align:center
I have to protect Kotatsu!

00:17:57.869 --> 00:17:59.287 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT]
I can do this!

00:17:59.371 --> 00:18:02.248 position:50% align:center
I'm a big, strong man!

00:18:04.793 --> 00:18:08.672 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:12.175 position:50% align:center
Medusa Whip!

00:18:13.802 --> 00:18:15.887 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT] How can she
deflect all my bullets?

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:19.015 position:50% align:center
My Medusa Whip's strands
spin with great power.

00:18:19.099 --> 00:18:20.600 position:50% align:center
Bask in awe!

00:18:24.354 --> 00:18:27.565 position:50% align:center
I can create a solid barrier
with its gyrations,

00:18:27.649 --> 00:18:28.983 position:50% align:center
while at the same time attack

00:18:29.067 --> 00:18:30.985 position:50% align:center
with the full force
of every lash.

00:18:31.069 --> 00:18:33.738 position:50% align:center
That's the power
of the Medusa Whip.

00:18:35.657 --> 00:18:37.701 position:50% align:center
Now, relent.

00:18:37.784 --> 00:18:40.078 position:50% align:center
For your tactic of merely
scattering attacks

00:18:40.161 --> 00:18:42.372 position:50% align:center
will be defeated with haste.

00:18:42.455 --> 00:18:44.165 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT]
How 'bout this?

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:56.177 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT]
No! Really?

00:18:56.261 --> 00:18:58.138 position:50% align:center
Surface dwellers are
simply pathetic.

00:18:58.221 --> 00:19:00.265 position:50% align:center
We're in the Nether, you fool!

00:19:02.267 --> 00:19:04.686 position:50% align:center
What exactly is
going on in there?

00:19:04.769 --> 00:19:06.771 position:50% align:center
You should be torn to shreds!

00:19:06.855 --> 00:19:09.566 position:50% align:center
First, I face a girl almost
impervious to flame,

00:19:09.649 --> 00:19:11.735 position:50% align:center
and now a hollow man?

00:19:11.818 --> 00:19:14.779 position:50% align:center
A small obstacle
to striking you down!

00:19:17.323 --> 00:19:18.908 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:18.992 --> 00:19:21.745 position:50% align:center
Ah, seems I've hit you at last.

00:19:23.163 --> 00:19:25.999 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT]
She's tough.

00:19:26.082 --> 00:19:29.210 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
J-Juggernaut.

00:19:29.294 --> 00:19:32.047 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT] Kotatsu!
Just hang in there, okay?

00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:33.882 position:50% align:center
I promise, I'm not gonna lose.

00:19:33.965 --> 00:19:37.969 position:50% align:center
I'll protect you
and avenge Hajiki!

00:19:38.053 --> 00:19:41.765 position:50% align:center
I can't be a coward forever!

00:19:41.848 --> 00:19:43.224 position:50% align:center
[MRS. NOTO]
Hey.

00:19:43.308 --> 00:19:46.269 position:50% align:center
I been lookin' all over hell
and creation for ya, son.

00:19:46.353 --> 00:19:49.731 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT] Mama,
I don't wanna join no army.

00:19:49.814 --> 00:19:52.108 position:50% align:center
I just wanna raise
up some taters.

00:19:52.192 --> 00:19:54.110 position:50% align:center
Ya ain't gotta choice in it.

00:19:54.194 --> 00:19:56.613 position:50% align:center
You got that dang
fire magic after all.

00:19:56.696 --> 00:19:58.823 position:50% align:center
Ya gotta go join that
ol' Tokyo Fire Force

00:19:58.907 --> 00:20:01.117 position:50% align:center
and make the world
less dangerous.

00:20:01.201 --> 00:20:04.496 position:50% align:center
Them tater fields could get
burnt up--you can't abide that.

00:20:04.579 --> 00:20:05.997 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT sighs]

00:20:06.081 --> 00:20:09.542 position:50% align:center
Come on. Be a man, would ya?

00:20:09.626 --> 00:20:11.836 position:50% align:center
And stop freakin'
out all the time.

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:12.921 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT]
But, Hajiki,

00:20:13.004 --> 00:20:15.465 position:50% align:center
that's impossible
for a guy like me.

00:20:15.548 --> 00:20:18.677 position:50% align:center
You joined the Fire Force
to protect people, didn't you?

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:20.261 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT]
I didn't become a Fire Soldier

00:20:20.345 --> 00:20:21.888 position:50% align:center
because I wanted to.

00:20:21.971 --> 00:20:24.641 position:50% align:center
I joined because I didn't
have any other choice.

But to be perfectly honest,

00:20:30.063 --> 00:20:32.315 position:50% align:center
I don't think I'm
really cut out for it.
