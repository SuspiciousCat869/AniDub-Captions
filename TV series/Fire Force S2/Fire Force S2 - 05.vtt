[yells]

00:00:27.235 --> 00:00:28.695 position:50% align:center
[HAUMEA]
Charon!

00:00:28.778 --> 00:00:31.156 position:50% align:center
I've still got my hands kinda
full with this pest up here.

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:33.408 position:50% align:center
So hurry up and grab the Pillar!

00:00:33.491 --> 00:00:36.286 position:50% align:center
I read you. Will do.

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:40.165 position:50% align:center
Bastard!

00:00:42.334 --> 00:00:44.919 position:50% align:center
You can't win, so give up!

00:00:49.758 --> 00:00:51.968 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
It's like fighting a boulder.

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:54.804 position:50% align:center
None of my attacks are
even making him flinch.

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:56.973 position:50% align:center
Nothing seems to hurt him.

00:00:58.975 --> 00:00:59.559 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Again?

00:00:59.642 --> 00:01:01.311 position:50% align:center
Snap!

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.070 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Damn it.

00:01:10.153 --> 00:01:13.782 position:50% align:center
After all this, there's
still not a scratch on him.

00:01:13.865 --> 00:01:15.992 position:50% align:center
I'm putting out tons
of energy with my kicks,

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:18.828 position:50% align:center
so where is all that going?

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:22.582 position:50% align:center
Plus, he's got that explosive
pyrokinetic ability.

00:01:22.665 --> 00:01:23.667 position:50% align:center
I mean when he walks,

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.212 position:50% align:center
he triggers explosions
with his feet.

00:01:27.295 --> 00:01:29.964 position:50% align:center
But he's walking quietly now.

00:01:30.048 --> 00:01:33.760 position:50% align:center
Did those explosions
use up all his juice?

00:01:37.055 --> 00:01:39.224 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Something's not adding up here.

00:01:39.307 --> 00:01:41.309 position:50% align:center
Need to think back and
reconsider everything

00:01:41.393 --> 00:01:43.395 position:50% align:center
from the start.

00:01:43.478 --> 00:01:46.189 position:50% align:center
There's energy that
just seems to vanish.

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:50.860 position:50% align:center
His explosions. And the way
he calls out his attacks.

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:52.821 position:50% align:center
He made a big show of
that first explosion

00:01:52.904 --> 00:01:55.824 position:50% align:center
at the beginning of our fight.

00:01:55.907 --> 00:01:59.244 position:50% align:center
All that lead me to believe
he was a third gen,

00:01:59.327 --> 00:02:01.079 position:50% align:center
but was I wrong?

00:02:03.331 --> 00:02:06.668 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Tell me, what
generation are you?

00:03:57.862 --> 00:04:00.824 position:50% align:center
[snarls]

00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:03.660 position:50% align:center
All of you get back
and stay back.

00:04:26.057 --> 00:04:27.976 position:50% align:center
Nice job. Incredible.

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:31.229 position:50% align:center
It's really no big deal.

00:04:31.312 --> 00:04:33.940 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA] You turned that
demon's flames into sound,

00:04:34.024 --> 00:04:36.276 position:50% align:center
and then turned
that sound into ice.

00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:38.695 position:50% align:center
Us second gens all have
our own specialties,

00:04:38.778 --> 00:04:41.156 position:50% align:center
but yours is like
nothing I've ever seen.

00:04:41.239 --> 00:04:43.366 position:50% align:center
Thanks, but I wish I
could fine-tune my power

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.578 position:50% align:center
to have the kind of ultra-fine
control you do over flames.

00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:50.915 position:50% align:center
All you second generations sure
do have some radical abilities.

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:53.501 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA] We may not be able
to create our own flames,

00:04:53.585 --> 00:04:54.961 position:50% align:center
but if we're facing a third gen,

00:04:55.045 --> 00:04:58.089 position:50% align:center
we can use their
fire against them.

00:04:58.173 --> 00:05:01.009 position:50% align:center
That's why a common tactic
we use when fighting them

00:05:01.092 --> 00:05:02.969 position:50% align:center
is to hide what we are.

00:05:03.053 --> 00:05:04.846 position:50% align:center
We can goad them into
creating the fire

00:05:04.929 --> 00:05:07.307 position:50% align:center
and send it right back at 'em.

00:05:08.683 --> 00:05:10.977 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
I know what's going on.

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.856 position:50% align:center
You set off that huge
explosion at the start

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:17.984 position:50% align:center
to fool me into thinking
you were a third gen.

00:05:18.068 --> 00:05:19.486 position:50% align:center
But what's really going on is

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:22.655 position:50% align:center
you convert the kinetic energy
from my attack into heat,

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:25.116 position:50% align:center
then release it
as your own attack.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.952 position:50% align:center
That right? You're a second gen.

00:05:28.036 --> 00:05:28.953 position:50% align:center
I just thought you were

00:05:29.037 --> 00:05:31.373 position:50% align:center
a typical muscle-headed
tough guy.

00:05:31.456 --> 00:05:34.626 position:50% align:center
Yep, hit the nail
on the head, kid.

00:05:38.838 --> 00:05:42.175 position:50% align:center
So how is that gonna
help you now?!

00:05:43.635 --> 00:05:45.470 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
He's got a point.

00:05:45.553 --> 00:05:47.472 position:50% align:center
I may have figured out
what he's doing,

00:05:47.555 --> 00:05:50.767 position:50% align:center
but still, that doesn't mean
I'm landing any attacks.

00:05:53.978 --> 00:05:57.691 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] If I wanna protect
Inca, I have to beat this guy.

00:05:57.774 --> 00:05:58.733 position:50% align:center
How?

00:05:58.817 --> 00:06:00.318 position:50% align:center
All hitting him does
is give him fuel

00:06:00.402 --> 00:06:02.278 position:50% align:center
for an explosive counterattack.

00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:05.240 position:50% align:center
But if I just stand here,
he's gonna beat me to a pulp.

00:06:05.323 --> 00:06:06.658 position:50% align:center
Something wrong?

00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:09.369 position:50% align:center
Are you too afraid of my
counters to even put up a fight?

00:06:09.452 --> 00:06:10.537 position:50% align:center
You know you're eventually

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.164 position:50% align:center
gonna have to attack me
to win, don't you?

00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:17.335 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
C'mon, think.

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:18.878 position:50% align:center
As long as I don't
lay a hand on him,

00:06:18.962 --> 00:06:20.130 position:50% align:center
he can't hit me back that hard.

00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:22.298 position:50% align:center
Help me out, men!

00:06:23.967 --> 00:06:25.969 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Seriously?

00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:36.021 position:50% align:center
[CHARON yells]

00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:44.237 position:50% align:center
[yelling]

00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:49.743 position:50% align:center
[CHARON]
Stamp!

00:06:58.543 --> 00:07:01.129 position:50% align:center
[CHARON'S MEN chuckle]

00:07:04.507 --> 00:07:06.468 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Hang on.

00:07:08.762 --> 00:07:12.057 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] I got it.
It's all about timing.

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.934 position:50% align:center
He absorbs energy,
pulling it inward,

00:07:15.018 --> 00:07:17.604 position:50% align:center
but at the moment he
releases that energy,

00:07:17.687 --> 00:07:20.065 position:50% align:center
his second-generation
control over the flames

00:07:20.148 --> 00:07:22.067 position:50% align:center
is directed outward.

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:25.820 position:50% align:center
So I have to counter his
counter at just the right time.

00:07:25.904 --> 00:07:31.284 position:50% align:center
I'm not 100% sure it'll work,
but it's worth trying.

00:07:31.368 --> 00:07:34.496 position:50% align:center
And that's all I
can do right now.

00:07:34.579 --> 00:07:36.623 position:50% align:center
Using the Corna!

00:07:37.707 --> 00:07:39.084 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:07:48.468 --> 00:07:52.639 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] I'll knock him down.
Right on his ass!

00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:00.230 position:50% align:center
Clap!

00:08:00.313 --> 00:08:01.564 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Now!

00:08:04.192 --> 00:08:06.611 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
No, it didn't work.

00:08:06.695 --> 00:08:09.614 position:50% align:center
It caused an explosion
when I used it in Asakusa.

00:08:09.698 --> 00:08:11.408 position:50% align:center
What changed?

00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:17.455 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] I know. I've gotta
be more psyched up.

00:08:17.539 --> 00:08:19.791 position:50% align:center
All right, let's do this!

00:08:21.459 --> 00:08:24.254 position:50% align:center
Blow up, damn you!

00:08:26.464 --> 00:08:27.924 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA yells]

00:08:38.601 --> 00:08:40.895 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Why the hell did
Captain Obi even tell me

00:08:40.979 --> 00:08:43.815 position:50% align:center
about the Corna
in the first place?

00:08:47.444 --> 00:08:49.821 position:50% align:center
[OBI] Different people have
called it different things.

00:08:49.904 --> 00:08:53.616 position:50% align:center
The "Maloik Sign," the "Devil's
Sign," or the "Corna."

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:57.704 position:50% align:center
But the two fingers sticking up
look like the horns of a devil.

00:08:57.787 --> 00:08:59.456 position:50% align:center
When we Fire Soldiers
lose heart,

00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:02.083 position:50% align:center
it's the beginning
of the end for us.

00:09:02.167 --> 00:09:03.668 position:50% align:center
So when you feel
things slipping,

00:09:03.752 --> 00:09:05.587 position:50% align:center
flash this sign and
let it fill you up

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:06.963 position:50% align:center
with the fighting spirit.

00:09:07.047 --> 00:09:08.923 position:50% align:center
But I don't understand why, sir.

00:09:09.007 --> 00:09:12.260 position:50% align:center
'Cause I'm trying to do my best
to be a hero, not a devil.

00:09:12.344 --> 00:09:13.762 position:50% align:center
How 'bout this?

00:09:13.845 --> 00:09:16.348 position:50% align:center
A long time ago, there was rock,
which was a type of music,

00:09:16.431 --> 00:09:18.975 position:50% align:center
and the performers
used this sign.

00:09:19.059 --> 00:09:21.227 position:50% align:center
Now, it's only in audio
files at the museum,

00:09:21.311 --> 00:09:24.773 position:50% align:center
but back in the day,
it got people pumped up!

00:09:25.857 --> 00:09:28.485 position:50% align:center
So when you're in a pinch,
just remember "rock,"

00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:30.195 position:50% align:center
and then flash this sign.

00:09:30.278 --> 00:09:33.114 position:50% align:center
It'll fill you with
the power of rock!

00:09:33.198 --> 00:09:35.158 position:50% align:center
That's pretty cool, isn't it?

00:09:35.241 --> 00:09:37.952 position:50% align:center
It's kinda like your
own trademark.

00:09:41.706 --> 00:09:43.958 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
I've got this sinking feeling

00:09:44.042 --> 00:09:47.337 position:50% align:center
that if I go down here,
I may never get up.

00:09:49.005 --> 00:09:51.925 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] If I miss the timing
by a fraction of a second,

00:09:52.008 --> 00:09:56.054 position:50% align:center
it'll all come back
on me even harder.

00:09:56.137 --> 00:10:00.725 position:50% align:center
Can I really pull this off?
Is it actually gonna work?

00:10:02.977 --> 00:10:05.689 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] I'm not afraid
and I'm not freaking out.

00:10:05.772 --> 00:10:08.942 position:50% align:center
I just wanna be sure
the odds are in my favor.

00:10:09.025 --> 00:10:12.570 position:50% align:center
Which is why I need to put forth
the effort to make it work.

00:10:12.654 --> 00:10:16.157 position:50% align:center
And find the courage
I need to pull it off.

00:10:16.241 --> 00:10:17.992 position:50% align:center
No matter how much I fight it,

00:10:18.076 --> 00:10:21.496 position:50% align:center
this devil thing
keeps following me.

00:10:21.579 --> 00:10:25.041 position:50% align:center
Fine. That means...

00:10:25.125 --> 00:10:28.962 position:50% align:center
...I gotta be a devil
that fights evil!

00:10:35.385 --> 00:10:38.013 position:50% align:center
--Corna!
--Now, Clap!

00:10:38.096 --> 00:10:42.142 position:50% align:center
Is that...? No way.

00:10:43.935 --> 00:10:48.148 position:50% align:center
Choke on this: Flames of Hell!

00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:58.366 position:50% align:center
[CHARON'S MEN]
No, Charon!

00:11:10.795 --> 00:11:13.590 position:50% align:center
Rock and roll!

00:11:26.144 --> 00:11:28.855 position:50% align:center
Charon the Reflector's
really down?

00:11:28.938 --> 00:11:30.023 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Let the girl go!

00:11:30.106 --> 00:11:31.441 position:50% align:center
[CHARON'S MEN gasp]

00:11:34.152 --> 00:11:36.821 position:50% align:center
The Fire Force will
take care of her.

00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:43.495 position:50% align:center
[CHARON'S MEN chuckle]

00:12:01.137 --> 00:12:02.389 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.527 position:50% align:center
[KARIM] He already broke
out of my ice already.

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:17.445 position:50% align:center
I was hoping my ice
would buy us more time.

00:12:17.529 --> 00:12:19.864 position:50% align:center
Everybody needs to stand back.

00:12:23.576 --> 00:12:25.954 position:50% align:center
[TAGUCHI] We'll create
a firewall for protection.

00:12:26.037 --> 00:12:29.749 position:50% align:center
Second gens, team up and
take defensive positions.

00:12:34.087 --> 00:12:35.839 position:50% align:center
A real demon.

00:12:35.922 --> 00:12:38.967 position:50% align:center
How are we supposed to take
out somethin' like that?

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:40.385 position:50% align:center
As far as I know,

00:12:40.468 --> 00:12:43.638 position:50% align:center
the Special Fire Force has
only beaten a demon twice.

00:12:43.722 --> 00:12:46.474 position:50% align:center
Both were in Asakusa,
when Lieutenant Konro

00:12:46.558 --> 00:12:49.477 position:50% align:center
used the insane firepower
of Crimson Moon,

00:12:49.561 --> 00:12:53.314 position:50% align:center
and then again when
Captain Shinmon used it.

00:12:53.398 --> 00:12:56.109 position:50% align:center
I mean, theoretically,
it's possible.

00:12:56.192 --> 00:12:58.820 position:50% align:center
We just gotta cook up
that much power.

00:12:58.903 --> 00:13:01.239 position:50% align:center
[OBI] How can we get up
to that level, though?

00:13:01.322 --> 00:13:03.491 position:50% align:center
You got any thoughts
on that, Licht?

00:13:03.575 --> 00:13:05.535 position:50% align:center
My thought is, you're
asking the wrong guy.

00:13:05.618 --> 00:13:07.620 position:50% align:center
Why didn't you call
Company 7 to help us, sir?

00:13:07.704 --> 00:13:11.416 position:50% align:center
I did call! But those
guys never answer!

00:13:11.499 --> 00:13:15.628 position:50% align:center
We've got tons of flames!
Should I freeze him again?

00:13:16.838 --> 00:13:18.548 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Uhh...

00:13:22.594 --> 00:13:24.346 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:36.524 position:50% align:center
We've got all the flames
we would ever need.

00:13:36.608 --> 00:13:37.609 position:50% align:center
Lightbulb!

00:13:37.692 --> 00:13:39.110 position:50% align:center
Eh?

00:13:39.194 --> 00:13:41.112 position:50% align:center
I thought of a plan that'll kill
two birds with one stone--

00:13:41.196 --> 00:13:43.073 position:50% align:center
the flames and the demon.

00:13:43.156 --> 00:13:45.909 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Okay, so how do we do that?

00:13:45.992 --> 00:13:50.038 position:50% align:center
We use the layout of the city,
plus all the second generations,

00:13:50.121 --> 00:13:51.581 position:50% align:center
to round up all
the burning flames

00:13:51.664 --> 00:13:54.751 position:50% align:center
and take the demon with them.

00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:57.462 position:50% align:center
Let's get started! He!

00:14:10.183 --> 00:14:12.143 position:50% align:center
[2ND CREWMAN A] This is
Yamazaki. Target point reached.

00:14:12.227 --> 00:14:14.062 position:50% align:center
[2ND CREWMAN B]
This is Yamamoto! In position.

00:14:14.145 --> 00:14:16.064 position:50% align:center
[2ND CREWMAN C] Moritani here.
At the target point.

00:14:16.147 --> 00:14:20.652 position:50% align:center
2nd Platoon Leader Taguchi.
I've reached the target point.

00:14:20.735 --> 00:14:22.737 position:50% align:center
[TOKUYAMA] This is 5th
Platoon Leader Tokuyama.

00:14:22.821 --> 00:14:24.406 position:50% align:center
We've all reached
our target points.

00:14:24.489 --> 00:14:25.782 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
Copy!

00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:28.868 position:50% align:center
The 2nd and 5th platoon
members are all in position.

00:14:28.952 --> 00:14:31.079 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Hinawa! You're on the demon!

00:14:31.162 --> 00:14:32.831 position:50% align:center
Roger that.

00:14:37.293 --> 00:14:38.753 position:50% align:center
Come on.

00:14:41.756 --> 00:14:44.968 position:50% align:center
Hey, are you sure I shouldn't
be doing anything right now?

00:14:45.051 --> 00:14:46.428 position:50% align:center
Yeah, 'cause we're
counting on you

00:14:46.511 --> 00:14:49.139 position:50% align:center
to put on the finishing
touch, Lieutenant.

00:14:49.222 --> 00:14:50.765 position:50% align:center
The flames are
burning like crazy

00:14:50.849 --> 00:14:53.476 position:50% align:center
all over the city at the moment.

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.311 position:50% align:center
So we'll gather them
up into one place

00:14:55.395 --> 00:14:57.439 position:50% align:center
and extinguish them all at once.

00:14:57.522 --> 00:14:59.065 position:50% align:center
Sounds easy when you
say it like that,

00:14:59.149 --> 00:15:00.900 position:50% align:center
but it's gonna be easier
said than done.

00:15:00.984 --> 00:15:03.236 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Since we have so many
second generations on hand

00:15:03.319 --> 00:15:05.321 position:50% align:center
who can manipulate
and control flames,

00:15:05.405 --> 00:15:06.656 position:50% align:center
we're gonna harness that

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:09.743 position:50% align:center
and pair it with the town's
inherent wind power.

00:15:09.826 --> 00:15:11.745 position:50% align:center
Say what?

00:15:11.828 --> 00:15:14.289 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Places have several
different kinds of wind.

00:15:14.372 --> 00:15:16.458 position:50% align:center
And this place specifically

00:15:16.541 --> 00:15:20.962 position:50% align:center
has valley winds that blow
between high-rise buildings.

00:15:21.046 --> 00:15:24.758 position:50% align:center
And street winds that whizz
down the main thoroughfares.

00:15:24.841 --> 00:15:27.927 position:50% align:center
Those two types eventually
meet up right about here.

00:15:28.011 --> 00:15:30.513 position:50% align:center
Smack dab in the central square.

00:15:30.597 --> 00:15:32.515 position:50% align:center
That's the terminal point
where the winds blowing in

00:15:32.599 --> 00:15:35.852 position:50% align:center
from two directions
combine their forces.

00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:37.145 position:50% align:center
Huh.

00:15:37.228 --> 00:15:38.563 position:50% align:center
That means if we shepherd
the flame to a place

00:15:38.646 --> 00:15:40.523 position:50% align:center
where they can ride
those air currents,

00:15:40.607 --> 00:15:41.691 position:50% align:center
we can use that force

00:15:41.775 --> 00:15:43.151 position:50% align:center
with the power of the
second generations

00:15:43.234 --> 00:15:45.695 position:50% align:center
to concentrate all
the fire together.

00:15:45.779 --> 00:15:47.113 position:50% align:center
You see?

00:15:47.197 --> 00:15:50.992 position:50% align:center
The winds will move them
down to the central square.

00:15:51.076 --> 00:15:54.954 position:50% align:center
That's where crewman Maki
will be waiting for them.

00:15:57.665 --> 00:15:59.626 position:50% align:center
[FIRE SOLDIER A]
Everybody, please stay back!

00:15:59.709 --> 00:16:01.294 position:50% align:center
Stay back!

00:16:01.378 --> 00:16:03.254 position:50% align:center
Please go to a safe location!

00:16:03.338 --> 00:16:06.508 position:50% align:center
Stay calm! And be cautious!

00:16:06.591 --> 00:16:08.510 position:50% align:center
[CITIZEN A]
This town needs your help.

00:16:08.593 --> 00:16:11.429 position:50% align:center
It's the only home
I've ever known.

00:16:11.513 --> 00:16:13.056 position:50% align:center
Just leave it to us.

00:16:13.139 --> 00:16:16.142 position:50% align:center
The Special Fire Force
will keep you safe.

00:16:20.522 --> 00:16:22.357 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] In order to put
the demon to rest,

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.900 position:50% align:center
we'll create a kind
of phenomenon

00:16:23.983 --> 00:16:26.236 position:50% align:center
with those concentrated flames.

00:16:26.319 --> 00:16:29.656 position:50% align:center
It's usually really bad when
this happens, a total disaster,

00:16:29.739 --> 00:16:32.033 position:50% align:center
but if crewman Maki can
keep it all under control,

00:16:32.117 --> 00:16:34.285 position:50% align:center
which we're <i>definitely</i>
counting on,

00:16:34.369 --> 00:16:36.621 position:50% align:center
the winds blowing into the
square from different directions

00:16:36.705 --> 00:16:40.750 position:50% align:center
will feed those hungry flames
and form a vortex of fire.

00:16:40.834 --> 00:16:43.003 position:50% align:center
And that is what we call...

00:16:43.086 --> 00:16:44.963 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:16:50.218 --> 00:16:52.637 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
...a firestorm.

00:16:52.721 --> 00:16:54.139 position:50% align:center
[KARIM] I've read reports
about these before

00:16:54.222 --> 00:16:56.933 position:50% align:center
in fire scene reports,
but you really made one?

00:16:57.017 --> 00:16:57.684 position:50% align:center
That's unreal!

00:16:57.767 --> 00:16:58.935 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Yes!

00:16:59.019 --> 00:17:00.812 position:50% align:center
My calculations,
and our amazing witch Maki,

00:17:00.895 --> 00:17:02.439 position:50% align:center
actually made it happen!

00:17:02.522 --> 00:17:07.110 position:50% align:center
It's exactly like Licht told
us--a huge fire tornado.

00:17:08.028 --> 00:17:12.240 position:50% align:center
What now? How do we get the
demon inside of that thing?

00:17:14.617 --> 00:17:15.827 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:17.537 --> 00:17:19.664 position:50% align:center
[MAKI]
Lieutenant Hinawa!

00:17:19.748 --> 00:17:23.251 position:50% align:center
Okay then. This is
not gonna be easy.

00:17:23.335 --> 00:17:24.753 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:17:24.836 --> 00:17:26.588 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
C'mon, big guy!

00:17:26.671 --> 00:17:28.673 position:50% align:center
Argh, hot!

00:17:32.302 --> 00:17:33.553 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Ah! What a scorcher!

00:17:33.636 --> 00:17:36.681 position:50% align:center
Please, sir.
We can't be reckless.

00:17:36.765 --> 00:17:38.266 position:50% align:center
But what can we do?

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:40.643 position:50% align:center
We have to get him
in there by force.

00:17:40.727 --> 00:17:44.314 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Hinawa, you keep him occupied.

00:17:44.397 --> 00:17:45.565 position:50% align:center
Where are you, Vulcan?

00:17:45.648 --> 00:17:47.400 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
Pulling up, sir!

00:17:51.071 --> 00:17:52.572 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA]
The Matchbox?

00:17:52.655 --> 00:17:53.990 position:50% align:center
What're you thinking, Captain?

00:17:54.074 --> 00:17:55.241 position:50% align:center
I'm thinkin' about that

00:17:55.325 --> 00:17:57.077 position:50% align:center
hare-brained fire
extinguisher Vulcan built.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:00.205 position:50% align:center
Wait. You're really
going to use that?

00:18:02.207 --> 00:18:06.044 position:50% align:center
Almost ready. Setting
the anchors now.

00:18:10.965 --> 00:18:13.468 position:50% align:center
I just need to keep this thing
distracted till you're ready?

00:18:13.551 --> 00:18:15.011 position:50% align:center
I can help you with that!

00:18:15.095 --> 00:18:17.263 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
Deploying extinguisher!

00:18:19.265 --> 00:18:21.810 position:50% align:center
[OBI] That ridiculous thing
has such an insane amount

00:18:21.893 --> 00:18:24.771 position:50% align:center
of water pressure that it
also destroys the target.

00:18:24.854 --> 00:18:26.940 position:50% align:center
Captain Obi, you take
the gunner's seat!

00:18:27.023 --> 00:18:28.983 position:50% align:center
What?! You want me to shoot it?

00:18:29.067 --> 00:18:31.611 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN] The aim assist will
automatically follow the sight.

00:18:31.695 --> 00:18:34.072 position:50% align:center
That means all you have to
do is to target the center

00:18:34.155 --> 00:18:36.574 position:50% align:center
and push the button.

00:18:36.658 --> 00:18:38.702 position:50% align:center
You sure about this?

00:18:41.705 --> 00:18:46.001 position:50% align:center
Wow. Okay, harder
than it sounds.

00:18:47.627 --> 00:18:51.006 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN] All right, Captain!
Now! Hit that button!

00:18:51.089 --> 00:18:53.049 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Uhh...

00:18:53.133 --> 00:18:55.301 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
Captain. Is there a problem?

00:18:55.385 --> 00:18:57.053 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Uh... I got it.

00:18:57.137 --> 00:18:58.013 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
Is somethin' wrong?

00:18:58.096 --> 00:19:00.557 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
That's it, right? Er...

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:01.933 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
Come on, Captain!

00:19:02.017 --> 00:19:04.310 position:50% align:center
You got this! Shoot! Now!

00:19:04.394 --> 00:19:08.148 position:50% align:center
Fire away! Right there!
Like now! Come on! Do it!

00:19:08.231 --> 00:19:10.400 position:50% align:center
What?!

00:19:10.483 --> 00:19:13.153 position:50% align:center
Hey, Captain Obi!
What are you waitin' for?

00:19:13.236 --> 00:19:14.404 position:50% align:center
Just shoot it already!

00:19:14.487 --> 00:19:16.614 position:50% align:center
[OBI] I've always sucked
at these kinds of games!

00:19:16.698 --> 00:19:18.283 position:50% align:center
All you gotta do
is shoot the thing.

00:19:18.366 --> 00:19:19.951 position:50% align:center
That's the part
I'm the worst at!

00:19:20.035 --> 00:19:21.786 position:50% align:center
A game would be way
harder than this!

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:24.706 position:50% align:center
Oh, is this it?

00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:26.416 position:50% align:center
Boop.

00:19:26.499 --> 00:19:28.585 position:50% align:center
Agh! Come on!

00:19:29.669 --> 00:19:31.296 position:50% align:center
Hey, what the hell
are you doing?!

00:19:31.379 --> 00:19:33.256 position:50% align:center
It's not makin' it easier
to aim, ya know!

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:36.760 position:50% align:center
I'm making it so you don't
even have to aim, okay?

00:19:39.596 --> 00:19:40.930 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
Gotcha!

00:19:42.724 --> 00:19:45.518 position:50% align:center
He's right in front
of you! Now go!

00:19:45.602 --> 00:19:48.229 position:50% align:center
You're goin' down!

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:56.905 position:50% align:center
The wind is whirling
around in that firestorm

00:19:56.988 --> 00:19:59.199 position:50% align:center
at approximately 60
meters per second!

00:19:59.282 --> 00:20:01.242 position:50% align:center
There's no way he's
gettin' outta that!

00:20:01.326 --> 00:20:02.118 position:50% align:center
Now!

00:20:02.202 --> 00:20:03.995 position:50% align:center
I'll take it from here, Captain.

00:20:10.085 --> 00:20:12.045 position:50% align:center
Trajectory Control.

00:20:14.005 --> 00:20:16.466 position:50% align:center
This firestorm is a testament
of the bond shared

00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:18.927 position:50% align:center
by the entire Fire Force.

00:20:20.553 --> 00:20:24.849 position:50% align:center
Come on, 8th, you can do this.

00:20:24.933 --> 00:20:26.726 position:50% align:center
What an amazing thing to watch!

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:28.895 position:50% align:center
The lieutenant's using
the firestorm as fuel

00:20:28.978 --> 00:20:31.940 position:50% align:center
to accelerate the
projectile's velocity!

00:20:32.023 --> 00:20:34.609 position:50% align:center
Ah, it's like the barrel
of a humongous railgun

00:20:34.693 --> 00:20:37.195 position:50% align:center
made completely outta fire.

00:20:44.619 --> 00:20:48.581 position:50% align:center
From this point, the Fire Force
will be united as one.

00:20:57.298 --> 00:20:58.425 position:50% align:center
[LICHT yelps]

00:20:58.508 --> 00:20:59.968 position:50% align:center
Hey, Lieutenant Karim.

00:21:00.051 --> 00:21:02.345 position:50% align:center
I think that's about
all I can do right now!

00:21:02.429 --> 00:21:06.016 position:50% align:center
Very well done! I can
take it over from here!

00:21:13.773 --> 00:21:15.442 position:50% align:center
That's gotta be
Lieutenant Karim!

00:21:15.525 --> 00:21:18.319 position:50% align:center
He froze it in an instant, huh?

00:21:23.324 --> 00:21:26.411 position:50% align:center
That's a lifetime of ice
to last a lifetime.

00:21:26.494 --> 00:21:29.122 position:50% align:center
Company 7's captain and
lieutenant are incredible.

00:21:29.205 --> 00:21:32.208 position:50% align:center
They put one of those demons
to rest by themselves.

00:21:32.292 --> 00:21:34.961 position:50% align:center
Kinda hard to believe.

00:21:35.045 --> 00:21:36.755 position:50% align:center
[TAGUCHI]
It's over.

00:21:38.214 --> 00:21:41.051 position:50% align:center
That was on the scale of the
Great Fire two years ago,

00:21:41.134 --> 00:21:44.054 position:50% align:center
and he still kept the damage
down to a minimum.

00:21:44.137 --> 00:21:49.100 position:50% align:center
I see. That's the greatness
of Captain Obi.

00:21:49.184 --> 00:21:51.811 position:50% align:center
And the amazing
strength of the 8th.

00:21:53.688 --> 00:21:55.440 position:50% align:center
You did well. Thanks.

00:21:55.523 --> 00:21:57.233 position:50% align:center
And thank you, Lieutenant.

00:21:57.317 --> 00:22:01.488 position:50% align:center
It was so awesome to see
a firestorm from this close!

00:22:01.571 --> 00:22:04.532 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN] That cool breeze
is just what I needed.

00:22:04.616 --> 00:22:07.452 position:50% align:center
[OBI] Don't forget the help we
got from the other companies.

00:22:07.535 --> 00:22:09.829 position:50% align:center
We couldn't have
done it without them.

00:22:09.913 --> 00:22:11.164 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:22:11.247 --> 00:22:14.334 position:50% align:center
But we still gotta deal
with the White-Clad goons.

00:22:14.417 --> 00:22:19.422 position:50% align:center
Shinra, Arthur,
it's up to you guys.

00:22:19.506 --> 00:22:22.801 position:50% align:center
[INCA] Where'd that huge
pillar of ice come from?

00:22:22.884 --> 00:22:26.554 position:50% align:center
What the hell is
happening right now?

00:22:26.638 --> 00:22:29.015 position:50% align:center
It's terrifying.

00:22:29.099 --> 00:22:31.643 position:50% align:center
You're the first person
that's been able to hurt me.

00:22:31.726 --> 00:22:34.187 position:50% align:center
That's quite an accomplishment.

00:22:35.438 --> 00:22:38.441 position:50% align:center
And you better believe
I'll do it again.

00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:20.794 position:50% align:center
[IRIS]
Shinra gives it all he's got

00:24:20.877 --> 00:24:24.464 position:50% align:center
to protect the Fifth Pillar,
a fiery girl named Inca.

00:24:24.547 --> 00:24:27.092 position:50% align:center
But what's her story?
What does she want?

00:24:27.175 --> 00:24:30.220 position:50% align:center
And I wonder, whose side
is she really on?

00:24:30.303 --> 00:24:32.764 position:50% align:center
[INCA] If you're a man of
your word, then come find me.

00:24:32.847 --> 00:24:34.557 position:50% align:center
I'll be waiting.

00:24:34.641 --> 00:24:36.226 position:50% align:center
[IRIS]
