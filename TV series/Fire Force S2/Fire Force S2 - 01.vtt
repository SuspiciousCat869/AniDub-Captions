00:00:19.227 --> 00:00:21.771 position:50% align:center
[OBI] Causes of death
are many and varied.

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:25.191 position:50% align:center
Old age. Illness. Suicide.

00:00:25.275 --> 00:00:26.985 position:50% align:center
But out of that long,
morbid list,

00:00:27.068 --> 00:00:30.739 position:50% align:center
there's one end that people
fear above all others.

00:00:33.658 --> 00:00:35.660 position:50% align:center line:10%
[OBI]
Death by fire.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.019 position:50% align:center
[PEOPLE chattering]

00:01:01.102 --> 00:01:02.687 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:01:02.771 --> 00:01:05.815 position:50% align:center
So! Where to next?

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:09.611 position:50% align:center
I think they're selling
ice cream over that way.

00:01:09.694 --> 00:01:11.237 position:50% align:center
It looked really good, too.

00:01:11.321 --> 00:01:12.072 position:50% align:center
C'mon!

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:13.573 position:50% align:center
Aw, they're so lucky.

00:01:13.656 --> 00:01:16.326 position:50% align:center
The two of them both look so
cute and feminine, ya know?

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.536 position:50% align:center
If you wanna wear girly
stuff, you should do it.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:19.579 position:50% align:center
I bet you'd look great.

00:01:19.662 --> 00:01:21.456 position:50% align:center
I guess I could.

00:01:26.211 --> 00:01:28.171 position:50% align:center
Then again, maybe not.

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:29.673 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:01:37.222 --> 00:01:40.975 position:50% align:center
[inaudible]

00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:44.145 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] It's like the fight
in the Nether never happened.

00:01:53.363 --> 00:01:55.824 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Everyone in this crowd
is afraid that one day

00:01:55.907 --> 00:01:59.411 position:50% align:center
they could turn Infernal.

00:01:59.494 --> 00:02:03.832 position:50% align:center
I don't want those happy smiles
to turn into forced ones.

00:02:03.915 --> 00:02:05.834 position:50% align:center
I'll find a way
to cure Infernals,

00:02:05.917 --> 00:02:08.336 position:50% align:center
learn the secrets of the
Evangelist and Adolla,

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.965 position:50% align:center
and make spontaneous human
combustion a thing of the past.

00:02:12.048 --> 00:02:15.010 position:50% align:center
What's goin' on? Why're ya
makin' that weird face?

00:02:15.093 --> 00:02:16.720 position:50% align:center
You just had a crepe, right?

00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:19.681 position:50% align:center
How can you eat all these
sweets and not get sick?

00:02:19.764 --> 00:02:24.227 position:50% align:center
Hey, guys, listen. I think
I might have a fun idea.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.105 position:50% align:center
Operation: Make Over
the Lieutenant.

00:02:30.358 --> 00:02:33.319 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] It's been a while
since my last day off.

00:02:33.403 --> 00:02:35.655 position:50% align:center
I could brush up on
my soccer skills.

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.408 position:50% align:center
[MAKI] Wanna check out that
place I told you 'bout?

00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:39.743 position:50% align:center
For sure, let's do it!

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:41.453 position:50% align:center
Cool. We can shop for some
new clothes together.

00:02:41.536 --> 00:02:44.080 position:50% align:center
I'll be up for whatever as long
as we get ice cream, too.

00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:46.750 position:50% align:center
A girl's day out. I can't wait!

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:49.836 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
They're all going shopping? Hm.

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:51.338 position:50% align:center
Enjoy your time off.

00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:53.590 position:50% align:center
[IRIS] The three of us were
planning to go out tomorrow.

00:02:53.673 --> 00:02:55.967 position:50% align:center
You're welcome to join
us if you'd like to.

00:02:56.051 --> 00:02:59.346 position:50% align:center
Seriously? Are you sure
you wouldn't mind?

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:01.306 position:50% align:center
Why'd you invite him, Iris?

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:03.308 position:50% align:center
Well, do you have
anything else going on?

00:03:03.391 --> 00:03:06.061 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Uh, no. Not really.

00:03:07.604 --> 00:03:08.605 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS]
Good afternoon, Lieutenant.

00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:10.023 position:50% align:center
Good afternoon, sir!

00:03:10.106 --> 00:03:12.067 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA]
You're all going shopping?

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.487 position:50% align:center
That sounds nice. You
kids have a good time.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.448 position:50% align:center
[OTHERS]
Yes, sir.

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:20.617 position:50% align:center
His outfits are as
out there as ever.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.369 position:50% align:center
Even if he has no
fashion sense,

00:03:22.452 --> 00:03:23.620 position:50% align:center
he knows how to read, right?

00:03:23.703 --> 00:03:24.913 position:50% align:center
I feel like he's the one

00:03:24.996 --> 00:03:28.124 position:50% align:center
who should be shopping
for new clothes tomorrow.

00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:29.584 position:50% align:center
Instead of shopping
for ourselves,

00:03:29.668 --> 00:03:31.753 position:50% align:center
let's find some stylish
clothes for the lieutenant.

00:03:31.836 --> 00:03:32.837 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that sounds like fun!

00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:34.214 position:50% align:center
Let's do it!

00:03:34.297 --> 00:03:39.386 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Sorry, sir. They've
turned you into a game.

00:03:42.013 --> 00:03:43.473 position:50% align:center
[MAMORU-KUN]
Oh, my.

00:03:43.556 --> 00:03:44.683 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
What do you think of this one?

00:03:44.766 --> 00:03:46.476 position:50% align:center
[MAKI] That's great,
but check out this.

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:47.560 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
Wait, look!

00:03:47.644 --> 00:03:48.812 position:50% align:center
You don't think we could
get him to wear

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:50.438 position:50% align:center
something like this, do you?

00:03:50.522 --> 00:03:54.067 position:50% align:center
A bald helmet? Even he
would turn that down.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.819 position:50% align:center
I don't feel like the
lieutenant's likely

00:03:55.902 --> 00:03:56.986 position:50% align:center
to put anything on his head

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.863 position:50% align:center
that isn't officially
considered a hat.

00:03:58.947 --> 00:04:02.158 position:50% align:center
[IRIS]
Well then, how about this?

00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:04.494 position:50% align:center
Oh... Is that what we're doing?

00:04:04.577 --> 00:04:06.037 position:50% align:center
Well, I hate to
burst your bubble,

00:04:06.121 --> 00:04:09.207 position:50% align:center
but a stuffed animal head
might be pushing it, too.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.167 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI, IRIS sigh]

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.756 position:50% align:center
That being said, I'm just
as curious as you two are

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.717 position:50% align:center
about where he might
draw the line.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.177 position:50% align:center
I wanna get him an outfit
that really pushes it.

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:23.596 position:50% align:center
I love the lieutenant--
this is so fun!

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.931 position:50% align:center
Hold on a second.

00:04:25.015 --> 00:04:27.142 position:50% align:center
What happened to trying
to help him dress better?

00:04:27.225 --> 00:04:28.977 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Wait, if we were
actually planning

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.689 position:50% align:center
to help him look cool,
why'd we come to this store?

00:04:33.732 --> 00:04:36.317 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Right. Because Maki picked it.

00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:38.319 position:50% align:center
[IRIS] I think you'd look
good in this, Shinra.

00:04:38.403 --> 00:04:40.280 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA gasps]

00:04:41.489 --> 00:04:44.325 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
She's... so close.

00:04:47.704 --> 00:04:49.372 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:04:49.456 --> 00:04:51.458 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
This is fun.

00:04:53.376 --> 00:04:55.128 position:50% align:center
Stop being gross.

00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:55.795 position:50% align:center
What's your problem?!

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:58.006 position:50% align:center
You are, skeezeball!

00:04:58.089 --> 00:04:59.966 position:50% align:center
Man, that girl's aggravating.

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.177 position:50% align:center
[IRIS] Listen, Tamaki was
just as worried about you

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.678 position:50% align:center
as Maki and I were.

00:05:03.762 --> 00:05:05.805 position:50% align:center
We all heard about
your mother, Shinra.

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:07.140 position:50% align:center
You can count on our help.

00:05:07.223 --> 00:05:09.100 position:50% align:center
I'm sure we'll find a way
to save her together.

00:05:09.184 --> 00:05:12.020 position:50% align:center
You were hurt so badly, and yet
you managed to pull through.

00:05:12.103 --> 00:05:14.606 position:50% align:center
I know you'll see Sho again.

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:18.860 position:50% align:center
Thanks a bunch, you two.

00:05:18.943 --> 00:05:24.074 position:50% align:center
I really am glad that
all of us are with the 8th.

00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:26.576 position:50% align:center
Do you really think
he's gonna wear it?

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:31.706 position:50% align:center
[PEOPLE screaming]

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:32.624 position:50% align:center
What's the plan?

00:05:32.707 --> 00:05:33.875 position:50% align:center
We need to ascertain the threat

00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.710 position:50% align:center
and make sure these
people are safe.

00:05:35.794 --> 00:05:38.296 position:50% align:center
Shinra, fly to the site
and scout it out.

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.465 position:50% align:center
Help any civilians
that are still there.

00:05:40.548 --> 00:05:42.008 position:50% align:center
You two are with me.

00:05:42.092 --> 00:05:44.969 position:50% align:center
We need to secure evacuation
routes for the civilians here.

00:05:45.053 --> 00:05:46.388 position:50% align:center
[OTHERS]
Understood!

00:06:27.721 --> 00:06:29.097 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA yells]

00:06:55.707 --> 00:06:56.875 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:59.461 --> 00:07:03.673 position:50% align:center
Excalibur!

00:07:08.053 --> 00:07:09.929 position:50% align:center
Uh, thanks.

00:07:14.351 --> 00:07:17.020 position:50% align:center
I am sworn to protect
the weak--devils included.

00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:18.188 position:50% align:center
You're welcome.

00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:20.190 position:50% align:center
Are ya sworn to be
a smug jerk about it?

00:07:37.123 --> 00:07:38.583 position:50% align:center
Are you all right, Shinra?

00:07:38.667 --> 00:07:40.752 position:50% align:center
Uh. Yeah!

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:56.726 position:50% align:center
Is that really an Infernal?

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:58.687 position:50% align:center
I didn't know they
could get this big.

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:00.313 position:50% align:center
We're ready, Captain.
What do we do?

00:08:00.397 --> 00:08:02.857 position:50% align:center
Now that the civilian
evacuation is complete,

00:08:02.941 --> 00:08:04.567 position:50% align:center
we can get right to it.

00:08:04.651 --> 00:08:06.277 position:50% align:center
Go put on your
bunker gear, Shinra.

00:08:06.361 --> 00:08:07.195 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir!

00:08:07.278 --> 00:08:08.571 position:50% align:center
Licht and Vulcan,

00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:10.907 position:50% align:center
I want you to focus on
finding that monster's core.

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:12.701 position:50% align:center
--All over it, sir.
--Leave it to us.

00:08:12.784 --> 00:08:14.661 position:50% align:center
[OBI] Be ready to start
the prayer, Sister.

00:08:14.744 --> 00:08:16.162 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir.

00:08:16.246 --> 00:08:18.164 position:50% align:center
I need the rest of you to
help me keep this thing busy.

00:08:18.248 --> 00:08:19.791 position:50% align:center
[OTHERS]
Understood!

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:09.424 position:50% align:center
Hold on, is this even possible?

00:09:09.507 --> 00:09:11.593 position:50% align:center
It's happenin', so it must be!

00:09:13.136 --> 00:09:14.471 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN, LICHT gasp]

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:18.933 position:50% align:center
Not good, not good, not good!

00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:26.691 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA yelps]

00:09:33.615 --> 00:09:34.783 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:41.331 --> 00:09:43.333 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
No you don't!

00:10:03.687 --> 00:10:05.397 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Have you turned up anything yet?

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.482 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, we got him
all figured out.

00:10:07.565 --> 00:10:10.193 position:50% align:center
Believe it or not, this
Infernal has multiple cores.

00:10:10.276 --> 00:10:12.362 position:50% align:center
So like a couple? Or more?

00:10:12.445 --> 00:10:14.155 position:50% align:center
To be precise, it has five.

00:10:14.239 --> 00:10:16.199 position:50% align:center
There's one in each
of its arms and legs,

00:10:16.282 --> 00:10:17.992 position:50% align:center
plus a reinforced main core.

00:10:18.076 --> 00:10:20.704 position:50% align:center
That one's in its chest
and its extra sturdy.

00:10:20.787 --> 00:10:22.956 position:50% align:center
[OBI] And the only way
to put this giant to rest

00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:24.958 position:50% align:center
is to take out all five cores?

00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:26.251 position:50% align:center
Yup, that's correct.

00:10:26.334 --> 00:10:28.128 position:50% align:center
I recommend that ya
start by takin' out

00:10:28.211 --> 00:10:29.963 position:50% align:center
the arms and legs
to immobilize it.

00:10:30.046 --> 00:10:32.716 position:50% align:center
That'll make it easier
to target the main core.

00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:35.176 position:50% align:center
If he's able to get a clean
shot at maximum firepower,

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.221 position:50% align:center
Shinra should be able
to bust through it.

00:10:38.304 --> 00:10:39.180 position:50% align:center
All right.

00:10:39.264 --> 00:10:40.849 position:50% align:center
Hinawa, Tamaki, and Maki,

00:10:40.932 --> 00:10:44.144 position:50% align:center
you have ranged attacks
so you'll take out the arms.

00:10:44.227 --> 00:10:46.438 position:50% align:center
Arthur and I'll get the legs.

00:10:46.521 --> 00:10:47.939 position:50% align:center
You'll end it, Shinra.

00:10:48.023 --> 00:10:49.107 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir!

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:50.525 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA] We can't afford
to waste any time.

00:10:50.608 --> 00:10:52.235 position:50% align:center
Let's move in together.

00:10:52.318 --> 00:10:53.737 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Commence the operation.

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:56.364 position:50% align:center
Note the time as 1420!

00:10:56.448 --> 00:10:57.907 position:50% align:center
[OTHERS]
Yes, sir!

00:10:59.993 --> 00:11:02.287 position:50% align:center
So that's the core, huh?

00:11:14.299 --> 00:11:17.135 position:50% align:center
[roars]

00:11:19.554 --> 00:11:20.513 position:50% align:center
[MAKI]
He's fast!

00:11:20.597 --> 00:11:22.807 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
I'll stop him in his tracks!

00:11:33.193 --> 00:11:34.611 position:50% align:center
All right, you two!
Let's get to work!

00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:36.905 position:50% align:center
--[SPUTTER] Sputter!
--[FLARE] Flare!

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:47.248 position:50% align:center
[MAKI]
Maximum power!

00:11:49.918 --> 00:11:54.214 position:50% align:center
[yelling]

00:11:54.297 --> 00:11:55.131 position:50% align:center
[SPUTTER]
Sputter!

00:11:55.215 --> 00:11:56.591 position:50% align:center
[FLARE]
Flare!

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:17.696 position:50% align:center
[INFERNAL A groaning]

00:12:17.779 --> 00:12:21.741 position:50% align:center
Thou art a fool to bare your
fangs to the Knight King.

00:12:21.825 --> 00:12:23.952 position:50% align:center
I am known as Sir Arthur Boyle.

00:12:24.035 --> 00:12:26.162 position:50% align:center
I'm captain of the Order
of the Round Table

00:12:26.246 --> 00:12:29.624 position:50% align:center
and the rightful
sovereign of Camelot.

00:12:41.678 --> 00:12:43.513 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Well done, everyone!

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:50.270 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
My turn.

00:13:02.282 --> 00:13:05.326 position:50% align:center
I train every day...

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:07.996 position:50% align:center
...so I can do stuff like this!

00:13:13.626 --> 00:13:16.338 position:50% align:center
Shinra! The rest is up to you!

00:13:16.421 --> 00:13:17.422 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:13:17.505 --> 00:13:19.758 position:50% align:center
The flame is the soul's breath.

00:13:19.841 --> 00:13:23.011 position:50% align:center
The black smoke is
the soul's release.

00:13:26.514 --> 00:13:28.850 position:50% align:center
Ashes thou wert and art.

00:13:28.933 --> 00:13:30.477 position:50% align:center
May thy soul return....

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:31.394 position:50% align:center
With this flame...

00:13:31.478 --> 00:13:34.105 position:50% align:center
...to the great flame of fire.

00:13:34.189 --> 00:13:37.776 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
...I'll set your soul free!

00:13:48.328 --> 00:13:50.038 position:50% align:center
[IRIS]
<i>Látom.</i>

00:15:25.425 --> 00:15:28.178 position:50% align:center
Oh, come on! Even you should
know not to wear that!

00:15:28.261 --> 00:15:30.013 position:50% align:center
Where's your sense of dignity?

00:15:30.096 --> 00:15:31.723 position:50% align:center
I'm terribly sorry, sir.

00:15:31.806 --> 00:15:34.225 position:50% align:center
[OBI] Didja come straight here
from some freaky night job

00:15:34.309 --> 00:15:34.893 position:50% align:center
you've been working?

00:15:34.976 --> 00:15:36.102 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA]
No, sir.

00:15:36.186 --> 00:15:37.729 position:50% align:center
I didn't realize the
outfit was a problem.

00:15:37.812 --> 00:15:40.023 position:50% align:center
[OBI] What the hell is
the matter with you?!

00:15:40.106 --> 00:15:42.567 position:50% align:center
Wonder what's makin' the
captain go off like that.

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:43.902 position:50% align:center
He sounds furious.

00:15:43.985 --> 00:15:46.696 position:50% align:center
Yeah, and with Lieutenant
Hinawa of all people.

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:48.239 position:50% align:center
What the heck are we gonna do?

00:15:48.323 --> 00:15:50.033 position:50% align:center
He's getting in a ton of trouble
and it's all because of us!

00:15:50.116 --> 00:15:51.910 position:50% align:center
But we never thought
he'd actually wear it!

00:15:51.993 --> 00:15:53.620 position:50% align:center
O, Lord. Please help us.

00:15:53.703 --> 00:15:56.831 position:50% align:center
Tell me, are you aware of what
the words on that cap say?

00:15:56.915 --> 00:16:00.126 position:50% align:center
No, sir. The cap's front never
entered my line of vision.

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:02.587 position:50% align:center
Where'd you even find
these ridiculous clothes?

00:16:02.671 --> 00:16:04.172 position:50% align:center
Did you buy all
this for yourself?

00:16:04.255 --> 00:16:05.840 position:50% align:center
This is bad. He's about
to find us out!

00:16:05.924 --> 00:16:06.591 position:50% align:center
What do we do?

00:16:06.675 --> 00:16:07.842 position:50% align:center
We'll apologize.

00:16:07.926 --> 00:16:10.303 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir. I bought all
these clothes myself.

00:16:10.387 --> 00:16:11.638 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS gasp]

00:16:11.721 --> 00:16:13.264 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Thanks, Lieutenant.
You're the coolest!

00:16:13.348 --> 00:16:14.599 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
I see.

00:16:14.683 --> 00:16:17.185 position:50% align:center
Well, in that case...

00:16:17.268 --> 00:16:19.813 position:50% align:center
Maki! Iris! Tamaki! Shinra!

00:16:19.896 --> 00:16:20.522 position:50% align:center
Come here!

00:16:20.605 --> 00:16:23.650 position:50% align:center
Aw. He worked it out.

00:16:23.733 --> 00:16:26.361 position:50% align:center
I know you gave these
clothes to the lieutenant.

00:16:26.444 --> 00:16:29.489 position:50% align:center
You took advantage of Hinawa's
utter indifference to fashion

00:16:29.572 --> 00:16:32.659 position:50% align:center
<i>and</i> of the trust he
gives his comrades.

00:16:32.742 --> 00:16:36.538 position:50% align:center
Now tell me which one of you
planned this ridiculous stunt!

00:16:38.123 --> 00:16:39.833 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] The girls asked me
to go shopping with them

00:16:39.916 --> 00:16:41.584 position:50% align:center
because they care about me.

00:16:41.668 --> 00:16:45.005 position:50% align:center
They're my Company 8
comrades, and my friends.

00:16:45.088 --> 00:16:48.258 position:50% align:center
The lieutenant wouldn't sell
them out, and I won't either.

00:16:48.341 --> 00:16:51.011 position:50% align:center
[MAKI, TAMAKI]
It was definitely Shinra.

00:16:53.138 --> 00:16:55.390 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Mom.

00:16:55.473 --> 00:16:59.477 position:50% align:center
Girls can be... terrifying.

00:17:07.694 --> 00:17:10.530 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Shinra, come here for a minute!

00:17:10.613 --> 00:17:11.823 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Yes, sir.

00:17:11.906 --> 00:17:14.034 position:50% align:center
Uhh...

00:17:14.117 --> 00:17:15.493 position:50% align:center
It's that part of
the year again,

00:17:15.577 --> 00:17:17.454 position:50% align:center
and this time around,
we're doin' it right.

00:17:17.537 --> 00:17:18.872 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Uh. Doing what?

00:17:18.955 --> 00:17:22.083 position:50% align:center
Our page in the Special
Fire Force nude calendar.

00:17:22.167 --> 00:17:24.377 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:17:26.963 --> 00:17:32.260 position:50% align:center
Wait, so the Special Fire Force
puts out its own nude calendar?

00:17:33.678 --> 00:17:37.891 position:50% align:center
You bet your ass, kid.

00:17:37.974 --> 00:17:41.561 position:50% align:center
It helps civvies get to know us.
Makes us more approachable.

00:17:41.644 --> 00:17:43.355 position:50% align:center
Okay, and you're saying
the photoshoot

00:17:43.438 --> 00:17:45.065 position:50% align:center
for this year's calendar
is coming up?

00:17:45.148 --> 00:17:46.107 position:50% align:center
In total, there are currently

00:17:46.191 --> 00:17:48.693 position:50% align:center
eight Special Fire
Force companies.

00:17:48.777 --> 00:17:50.278 position:50% align:center
Each company is
assigned one month

00:17:50.362 --> 00:17:52.280 position:50% align:center
between January and August.

00:17:52.364 --> 00:17:54.449 position:50% align:center
Company 8 is responsible
for August.

00:17:54.532 --> 00:17:56.868 position:50% align:center
So what do they do for
September through December?

00:17:56.951 --> 00:17:59.287 position:50% align:center
Those four months are
done by popularity.

00:17:59.371 --> 00:18:03.083 position:50% align:center
The top four start in September
and then go in ascending order.

00:18:03.166 --> 00:18:05.418 position:50% align:center
Whoever gets first place
takes December.

00:18:05.502 --> 00:18:08.755 position:50% align:center
Got it. What place did
the 8th get last year?

00:18:12.634 --> 00:18:13.843 position:50% align:center
Was it last place?

00:18:13.927 --> 00:18:15.053 position:50% align:center
Maybe.

00:18:15.136 --> 00:18:16.846 position:50% align:center
Mind if I take a look?

00:18:17.764 --> 00:18:19.224 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna do it.

00:18:19.307 --> 00:18:21.518 position:50% align:center
Uh, ya said it was
August, right?

00:18:21.601 --> 00:18:22.977 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:24.896 --> 00:18:26.648 position:50% align:center
You sure were enthusiastic.

00:18:26.731 --> 00:18:29.234 position:50% align:center
We go hard. The 8th always has.

00:18:29.317 --> 00:18:30.902 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:18:30.985 --> 00:18:32.862 position:50% align:center
Okay, who ended up in first?

00:18:32.946 --> 00:18:34.948 position:50% align:center
You said that I'd find
them in December?

00:18:35.031 --> 00:18:38.243 position:50% align:center
That company's popularity
is unrivaled.

00:18:42.622 --> 00:18:43.540 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA gasps]

00:18:43.623 --> 00:18:44.791 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Rekka!

00:18:44.874 --> 00:18:46.751 position:50% align:center
Their crowd favorite Rekka
did us a big favor

00:18:46.835 --> 00:18:48.128 position:50% align:center
by getting himself killed.

00:18:48.211 --> 00:18:50.005 position:50% align:center
I think we actually stand
a chance this year.

00:18:50.088 --> 00:18:51.756 position:50% align:center
That's right. It's our time.

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:55.176 position:50% align:center
That's kinda messed up to say,
even if the guy was a traitor.

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:58.013 position:50% align:center
N' speakin' of, Dr. Giovanni
should be in here.

00:18:58.096 --> 00:19:00.181 position:50% align:center
Did he show off his components?

00:19:04.436 --> 00:19:06.104 position:50% align:center
Yeah, this picture
must've been doctored.

00:19:06.187 --> 00:19:08.314 position:50% align:center
Damn you, Giovanni!

00:19:08.398 --> 00:19:10.525 position:50% align:center
So, everyone did this?

00:19:10.608 --> 00:19:11.818 position:50% align:center
Well, then...

00:19:11.901 --> 00:19:14.154 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA moans]

00:19:14.237 --> 00:19:15.655 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
That would include the 5th.

00:19:15.739 --> 00:19:17.449 position:50% align:center
Which means that
one of these pages

00:19:17.532 --> 00:19:21.494 position:50% align:center
could reveal the glory of
Captain Hibana's naked form.

00:19:22.871 --> 00:19:24.122 position:50% align:center
Who are these guys?!

00:19:24.205 --> 00:19:26.041 position:50% align:center
No one cares about them!
They're just human gravel!

00:19:26.124 --> 00:19:28.543 position:50% align:center
Were you hoping to find
something different, Shinra?

00:19:28.626 --> 00:19:31.254 position:50% align:center
The Fire Force calendar
is all male.

00:19:31.338 --> 00:19:33.131 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA]
Ohh!

00:19:33.214 --> 00:19:35.383 position:50% align:center
He'll be stark naked!

00:19:35.467 --> 00:19:37.927 position:50% align:center
I want to gaze upon
Shinra's calendar picture.

00:19:38.011 --> 00:19:39.095 position:50% align:center
I want to!

00:19:39.179 --> 00:19:43.475 position:50% align:center
I want to so bad,
but on the other hand...

00:19:43.558 --> 00:19:45.894 position:50% align:center
Everyone else will see, too!

00:19:45.977 --> 00:19:47.103 position:50% align:center
When that happens,

00:19:47.187 --> 00:19:49.397 position:50% align:center
the whole world will
understand his appeal.

00:19:49.481 --> 00:19:50.732 position:50% align:center
And from that day on,

00:19:50.815 --> 00:19:53.360 position:50% align:center
my dear Shinra won't just
belong to me anymore.

00:19:53.443 --> 00:19:55.653 position:50% align:center
Is this fate inevitable?

00:19:55.737 --> 00:19:57.989 position:50% align:center
Have I no choice
but to accept it?

00:19:58.073 --> 00:19:59.574 position:50% align:center
Excuse me, but we need you
to approve this year's--

00:19:59.657 --> 00:20:02.118 position:50% align:center
Silence, gravel!
Go with whatever!

00:20:02.202 --> 00:20:04.871 position:50% align:center
[IRIS laughing]

00:20:04.954 --> 00:20:07.791 position:50% align:center
I'm surprised you're
all so into this.

00:20:07.874 --> 00:20:10.877 position:50% align:center
Wait, there's no way the 7th
cares about this, right?

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:13.630 position:50% align:center
Captain Shinmon's picture
was actually pretty popular.

00:20:13.713 --> 00:20:16.341 position:50% align:center
Huh?! Captain Shinmon
posed for this thing?!

00:20:16.424 --> 00:20:18.301 position:50% align:center
I can understand why
people would like him,

00:20:18.385 --> 00:20:20.595 position:50% align:center
but how did they talk
him into doing it?

00:20:20.679 --> 00:20:22.639 position:50% align:center
He'll be July, right?

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:26.434 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Did they take
this without asking?

00:20:29.771 --> 00:20:31.398 position:50% align:center
[KONRO]
Hey. Where's Waka?

00:20:31.481 --> 00:20:33.483 position:50% align:center
Just saw him head
to the bathhouse.

00:20:33.566 --> 00:20:36.611 position:50% align:center
Is it time for his
next calendar shoot?

00:20:36.695 --> 00:20:40.115 position:50% align:center
I'll do whatever it takes to
make sure those Empire dirtbags

00:20:40.198 --> 00:20:42.033 position:50% align:center
don't show us up.

00:20:42.117 --> 00:20:45.245 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna use this to
snap some hot pics.

00:20:45.328 --> 00:20:48.206 position:50% align:center
Best of luck, Lieutenant.
I've got high expectations.

00:20:48.289 --> 00:20:50.333 position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:20:50.417 --> 00:20:52.836 position:50% align:center
You got me real good
last year, Konro.

00:20:52.919 --> 00:20:56.297 position:50% align:center
But did you actually think
I wouldn't find out?

00:20:56.381 --> 00:21:00.051 position:50% align:center
[KONRO] The people are waiting
for a strong, brash warrior

00:21:00.135 --> 00:21:03.054 position:50% align:center
who can win them all
over without trying.

00:21:03.138 --> 00:21:06.558 position:50% align:center
And I only know one man
who fits that bill.

00:21:08.059 --> 00:21:10.729 position:50% align:center
No one can do this
but you! Understand?

00:21:10.812 --> 00:21:12.230 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU]
Me?

00:21:13.523 --> 00:21:19.779 position:50% align:center
[BOTH shouting]

00:21:19.863 --> 00:21:21.698 position:50% align:center
A doctored photo,
an illicit one,

00:21:21.781 --> 00:21:23.825 position:50% align:center
and the gravel brigade.

00:21:23.908 --> 00:21:26.244 position:50% align:center
What does it say about us
that we lost to this mess?

00:21:26.327 --> 00:21:27.912 position:50% align:center
That's all behind us.

00:21:27.996 --> 00:21:30.415 position:50% align:center
This is a new year
and a new company.

00:21:30.498 --> 00:21:32.375 position:50% align:center
I trust our recruits
to do us proud!

00:21:32.459 --> 00:21:34.544 position:50% align:center
The 8th's calendar days
are just starting!

00:21:34.627 --> 00:21:36.171 position:50% align:center
--[ARTHUR] Heh.
--Call us the beef squad.

00:21:36.254 --> 00:21:37.005 position:50% align:center
That could help.

00:21:37.088 --> 00:21:38.214 position:50% align:center
I mean, in last year's pic,

00:21:38.298 --> 00:21:40.842 position:50% align:center
it was just Captain Obi
and Lieutenant Hinawa.

00:21:40.925 --> 00:21:42.344 position:50% align:center
And that does seem
a little lonely

00:21:42.427 --> 00:21:45.055 position:50% align:center
compared to some of
these other pictures.

00:21:45.138 --> 00:21:47.349 position:50% align:center
Sorry, sir, but I feel
like I've gotta ask...

00:21:47.432 --> 00:21:48.350 position:50% align:center
What's that pose?

00:21:48.433 --> 00:21:51.311 position:50% align:center
It's a little trick I learned.

00:21:51.394 --> 00:21:53.563 position:50% align:center
Where this here python...

00:21:53.646 --> 00:21:56.441 position:50% align:center
...becomes a... cobra.

00:21:56.524 --> 00:21:58.068 position:50% align:center
[OBI grunts]

00:21:59.027 --> 00:22:01.654 position:50% align:center
[BOTH laughing]

00:22:01.738 --> 00:22:02.822 position:50% align:center
There. See?

00:22:02.906 --> 00:22:04.366 position:50% align:center
It's an awesome pose--
the ladies dig it.

00:22:04.449 --> 00:22:06.868 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
No, no, no. Two ladies "dig" it.

00:22:06.951 --> 00:22:07.994 position:50% align:center
You can't base your picture

00:22:08.078 --> 00:22:09.371 position:50% align:center
off an inside joke
no one's gonna hear.

00:22:09.454 --> 00:22:11.247 position:50% align:center
What's the deal, Shinra?
Why the dead fish eyes?

00:22:11.331 --> 00:22:13.249 position:50% align:center
Not sure what you
expect, sir.

00:22:13.333 --> 00:22:15.877 position:50% align:center
Relax, I've got a plan that
guarantees our victory.

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:17.671 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] You mean you've come
up with a new weird joke?

00:22:17.754 --> 00:22:19.381 position:50% align:center
Whoever masters this technique

00:22:19.464 --> 00:22:21.508 position:50% align:center
will get to stand
front and center.

00:22:21.591 --> 00:22:23.760 position:50% align:center
So take a good look.

00:22:26.388 --> 00:22:30.517 position:50% align:center
Make your python a cobra.

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:32.227 position:50% align:center
And then...

00:22:33.228 --> 00:22:35.313 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
...bring out his twin.

00:22:38.525 --> 00:22:40.527 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Dead last.

00:24:18.667 --> 00:24:21.127 position:50% align:center
[IRIS] Shinra visits Captain
Hague of Company 4

00:24:21.211 --> 00:24:23.713 position:50% align:center
in search of information
about Adolla Bursts.

00:24:23.797 --> 00:24:26.174 position:50% align:center
The captain's strange
demeanor takes him aback,

00:24:26.257 --> 00:24:28.593 position:50% align:center
then something strange
comes over him.

00:24:28.677 --> 00:24:30.345 position:50% align:center
What's happened to you, Shinra?

00:24:30.428 --> 00:24:31.846 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
I've had enough.

00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:34.265 position:50% align:center
All of you can drop dead.

00:24:34.349 --> 00:24:35.975 position:50% align:center
