[growls]

00:00:10.802 --> 00:00:13.972 position:50% align:center
[OROCHI] I don't understand.
Why can't I stop him?

00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:43.376 position:50% align:center
You okay, Juggernaut?

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:49.591 position:50% align:center
Talk to me.

00:00:53.261 --> 00:00:54.637 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:58.058 position:50% align:center
We-We gotta stop the bleeding
and get outta here quick

00:00:58.141 --> 00:01:00.727 position:50% align:center
before more Infernals
come along.

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:03.730 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT]
Just go, Kotatsu.

00:01:03.813 --> 00:01:07.192 position:50% align:center
Leave me here. Save yourself.

00:01:07.275 --> 00:01:12.447 position:50% align:center
I can't feel my left leg.
I don't think I can stand up.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.366 position:50% align:center
Don't let me slow you down.

00:01:14.449 --> 00:01:17.035 position:50% align:center
There's no way I'm
leaving you here!

00:01:17.118 --> 00:01:20.997 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT]
You need to get away, right now.

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:25.460 position:50% align:center
I'm just dead weight--
way too big for you to carry.

00:01:25.543 --> 00:01:28.338 position:50% align:center
You'd never make it outta here.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.011 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT] It's okay. I did
what I was supposed to do.

00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:37.889 position:50% align:center
Finally found the courage
to match my size.

00:01:37.972 --> 00:01:40.392 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT coughing]

00:01:40.475 --> 00:01:42.394 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you did.

00:01:42.477 --> 00:01:45.146 position:50% align:center
You took down a White-Clad
all by yourself.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.192 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT]
No. I-I didn't do it alone.

00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:53.697 position:50% align:center
I was able to avenge
Hajiki... because of you.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.573 position:50% align:center
You gave me courage.

00:01:55.657 --> 00:01:59.119 position:50% align:center
You helped me be the
man I wanted to be,

00:01:59.202 --> 00:02:01.162 position:50% align:center
that I needed to be.

00:02:01.246 --> 00:02:05.709 position:50% align:center
Thanks to your help, I can
die without any regrets.

00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:08.461 position:50% align:center
I would like to have seen
my potato fields back home

00:02:08.545 --> 00:02:11.923 position:50% align:center
one last time, though.

00:02:12.007 --> 00:02:15.135 position:50% align:center
But having you here
for just a moment...

00:02:15.218 --> 00:02:18.388 position:50% align:center
...that's good enough for me.

00:02:18.471 --> 00:02:24.394 position:50% align:center
I can die happy, underground,
just like a potato.

00:02:24.477 --> 00:02:25.854 position:50% align:center
No way!

00:02:25.937 --> 00:02:27.939 position:50% align:center
You know you have to dig up
your potatoes, don't you?

00:02:28.023 --> 00:02:31.109 position:50% align:center
They have to last until
they're above ground!

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.239 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
Juggernaut?

00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:41.327 position:50% align:center
[INFERNALS snarling]

00:02:46.875 --> 00:02:48.209 position:50% align:center
I promise.

00:02:48.293 --> 00:02:51.629 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna take Juggernaut
back up to the surface!

00:04:27.183 --> 00:04:28.810 position:50% align:center
[2ND CREWMAN A]
Oh, man, we're toast!

00:04:28.893 --> 00:04:32.731 position:50% align:center
Shoot him! Now!
They're already dead, so fire!

00:04:32.814 --> 00:04:34.524 position:50% align:center
[2ND CREWMAN A yells]

00:04:34.607 --> 00:04:36.818 position:50% align:center
The Evangelist
is behind all this.

00:04:36.901 --> 00:04:38.111 position:50% align:center
I just can't believe that Maki

00:04:38.194 --> 00:04:40.780 position:50% align:center
was fighting against
these monsters.

00:04:40.864 --> 00:04:42.449 position:50% align:center
I assume you had her
providing support

00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:44.034 position:50% align:center
safely from the rear, Sergeant.

00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:46.911 position:50% align:center
Actually, we had her up front
and center as a meat shield.

00:04:46.995 --> 00:04:50.040 position:50% align:center
You used my baby sister
as a meat shield?

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:52.125 position:50% align:center
[TAKIGI screams]

00:04:55.003 --> 00:04:57.213 position:50% align:center
We're on the battlefield.
You can't lose focus.

00:04:57.297 --> 00:04:59.507 position:50% align:center
How could I after what you--?!

00:05:00.675 --> 00:05:03.219 position:50% align:center
It's like there's
no end to this.

00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:05.138 position:50% align:center
What was that?

00:05:10.894 --> 00:05:14.397 position:50% align:center
[IRON] I am Iron,
Knight of the Purple Haze!

00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:16.858 position:50% align:center
You surface dwelling
scum will burn!

00:05:16.941 --> 00:05:19.069 position:50% align:center
He's with the White-Clad.

00:05:22.197 --> 00:05:24.616 position:50% align:center
Just came into battle
and announced himself.

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:27.035 position:50% align:center
Is he as stupid as Arthur?

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:30.955 position:50% align:center
[IRON]
Ha! Felt like mosquito bites.

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:33.875 position:50% align:center
Seems guns don't work
on him. So, what next?

00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.378 position:50% align:center
I have a lot more
questions about Maki, too.

00:05:36.461 --> 00:05:38.296 position:50% align:center
Don't get yourself killed.

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:39.839 position:50% align:center
[IRON]
Dream on!

00:05:39.923 --> 00:05:43.885 position:50% align:center
You think your puny weapons
could scratch my body of steel?

00:05:43.968 --> 00:05:47.180 position:50% align:center
[IRON roars]

00:05:49.808 --> 00:05:52.686 position:50% align:center
Guess my squad got
freaked out and ran.

00:05:54.396 --> 00:05:56.940 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] How many lives have
died down here already?

00:05:57.023 --> 00:05:59.734 position:50% align:center
All those lives
just snuffed out.

00:05:59.818 --> 00:06:02.779 position:50% align:center
Concentrate.
Feel the life around you.

00:06:02.862 --> 00:06:03.988 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:09.452 position:50% align:center
Who's there?

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:24.009 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] It's been quite
a while, Shinra Kusakabe.

00:06:24.092 --> 00:06:25.885 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Dr. Giovanni!

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:28.054 position:50% align:center
What the hell are you
plotting this time?

00:06:28.138 --> 00:06:31.182 position:50% align:center
The lab Detective Oze discovered
was yours, wasn't it?

00:06:31.266 --> 00:06:34.477 position:50% align:center
How many've you killed?!
What are you doing down here?

00:06:34.561 --> 00:06:35.979 position:50% align:center
Answer me!

00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:37.897 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
That lab was but a trap.

00:06:37.981 --> 00:06:40.066 position:50% align:center
I was "chumming the
water," if you will.

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:44.279 position:50% align:center
And the Fire Force fell for it--
hook, line, and sinker.

00:06:44.362 --> 00:06:45.405 position:50% align:center
Say what?

00:06:45.488 --> 00:06:47.824 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
And now, Shinra Kusakabe,

00:06:47.907 --> 00:06:49.951 position:50% align:center
you will follow in the
footsteps of your brother

00:06:50.035 --> 00:06:52.245 position:50% align:center
and become one of us.

00:06:52.328 --> 00:06:53.997 position:50% align:center
Tell me where he is!

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.416 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
I've been customized for combat.

00:06:56.499 --> 00:06:59.294 position:50% align:center
This won't be like last time.

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:04.049 position:50% align:center
The hell?

00:07:06.926 --> 00:07:08.887 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] I told you
things were different.

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:10.764 position:50% align:center
I've improved myself.

00:07:10.847 --> 00:07:13.892 position:50% align:center
My body is more compatible
with the insects.

00:07:13.975 --> 00:07:16.144 position:50% align:center
More compatible?

00:07:16.227 --> 00:07:19.397 position:50% align:center
I don't get it. What'd you do?

00:07:22.317 --> 00:07:23.610 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER A]
Did you hear the news?

00:07:23.693 --> 00:07:26.279 position:50% align:center
The 2nd and 8th are on joint
operation in the Nether.

00:07:26.363 --> 00:07:27.530 position:50% align:center
Does this mean
we're gonna find out

00:07:27.614 --> 00:07:29.783 position:50% align:center
who the White-Clad really are?

00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:35.288 position:50% align:center
[MAKI]
Can't believe they went back.

00:07:37.248 --> 00:07:39.417 position:50% align:center
[2ND CREWMAN C]
Kusakabe! Are you okay?

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.837 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
This doesn't concern you.

00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:45.548 position:50% align:center
How can you just kill like that?

00:07:45.632 --> 00:07:49.094 position:50% align:center
Tell me! What have
you done to yourself?

00:07:55.392 --> 00:07:57.352 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Insect legs.

00:07:59.354 --> 00:08:00.730 position:50% align:center
[2ND CREWMAN D]
Now we're fighting real monsters

00:08:00.814 --> 00:08:02.065 position:50% align:center
down here?

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:04.484 position:50% align:center
[2ND CREWMAN E]
Fire! Fire!

00:08:13.451 --> 00:08:16.162 position:50% align:center
Get back! I'll handle him!

00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:21.543 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] We gotta get
this guy to safety,

00:08:21.626 --> 00:08:24.754 position:50% align:center
so I need to draw Giovanni away.

00:08:24.838 --> 00:08:27.632 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] You're planning to
protect the wounded, are you?

00:08:27.716 --> 00:08:30.552 position:50% align:center
Our main objective
here is collecting you.

00:08:30.635 --> 00:08:34.639 position:50% align:center
I suggest you worry
about yourself.

00:08:34.723 --> 00:08:36.766 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] I can use my speed
to close the distance

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:38.268 position:50% align:center
and knock him back a--

00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:40.395 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] You put far too much
faith in your speed, boy.

00:08:40.478 --> 00:08:42.772 position:50% align:center
You'll have to do better
than just charge at me.

00:08:42.856 --> 00:08:43.982 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:44.065 --> 00:08:46.735 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] How did he know
what I was thinking?

00:08:46.818 --> 00:08:49.738 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
Hair-pencils.

00:08:49.821 --> 00:08:52.907 position:50% align:center
Pheromone transmitting
structures.

00:08:52.991 --> 00:08:57.871 position:50% align:center
They're able to both release and
detect these chemical signals.

00:08:57.954 --> 00:09:01.416 position:50% align:center
I expanded upon their function
and developed the ability

00:09:01.499 --> 00:09:05.378 position:50% align:center
to read human emotional
and psychological states.

00:09:05.462 --> 00:09:08.923 position:50% align:center
So, in short, I know exactly
what you're thinking.

00:09:09.007 --> 00:09:11.926 position:50% align:center
You could say "a little
bug told me."

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:16.264 position:50% align:center
It's always insects with you.
What the hell is your deal?

00:09:16.348 --> 00:09:18.475 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
Surely you've heard the theory.

00:09:18.558 --> 00:09:21.519 position:50% align:center
Insects are an
extraterrestrial life form.

00:09:21.603 --> 00:09:24.105 position:50% align:center
They were bought here as
eggs attached to a meteor

00:09:24.189 --> 00:09:26.316 position:50% align:center
which crashed into the Earth.

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:30.320 position:50% align:center
In other words, they are
creatures not of this world.

00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:32.572 position:50% align:center
In fact, they hail from Adolla.

00:09:32.655 --> 00:09:35.241 position:50% align:center
I have been performing
experiments to prove

00:09:35.325 --> 00:09:38.286 position:50% align:center
that if you fuse an Adollan
insect with a human,

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:40.872 position:50% align:center
it will bring said human
closer to Adolla.

00:09:40.955 --> 00:09:42.916 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] So you
experimented on yourself

00:09:42.999 --> 00:09:46.044 position:50% align:center
to make you more compatible
with insects and Adolla?

00:09:46.127 --> 00:09:49.172 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] I will show you
the result of my research.

00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:52.926 position:50% align:center
I know you're dying to see it!

00:09:54.594 --> 00:09:57.639 position:50% align:center
The time's come for the Knight
King to act as rearguard.

00:09:57.722 --> 00:10:00.642 position:50% align:center
Gather the wounded and flee
to the surface at once.

00:10:00.725 --> 00:10:01.559 position:50% align:center
Thanks, buddy.

00:10:01.643 --> 00:10:05.188 position:50% align:center
[roaring]

00:10:14.781 --> 00:10:16.783 position:50% align:center
In battle, I'm a
one-man cavalry!

00:10:16.866 --> 00:10:19.160 position:50% align:center
My sword possessed
by divine frenzy!

00:10:19.244 --> 00:10:23.206 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR yells]

00:10:27.919 --> 00:10:29.587 position:50% align:center
He just left.

00:10:29.671 --> 00:10:32.424 position:50% align:center
Does he know what
"rearguard" means?

00:10:32.507 --> 00:10:34.426 position:50% align:center
He missed one!

00:10:34.509 --> 00:10:36.428 position:50% align:center
[2ND CREWMAN F]
C'mon! Fall back!

00:10:40.056 --> 00:10:41.975 position:50% align:center
I won't let you
get away with this!

00:10:42.058 --> 00:10:44.185 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] How will you
stop me, pray tell?

00:10:44.269 --> 00:10:47.605 position:50% align:center
You have all been
ensnared in our trap.

00:10:54.654 --> 00:10:57.282 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
That plasma user.

00:10:57.365 --> 00:11:00.952 position:50% align:center
Arthur. What are you doing?
Where's the rest of your squad?

00:11:01.036 --> 00:11:03.204 position:50% align:center
The Knight King simply
acted as their rearguard

00:11:03.288 --> 00:11:04.998 position:50% align:center
so they could flee to safety.

00:11:05.081 --> 00:11:07.292 position:50% align:center
You're pretty far away
to be their rearguard.

00:11:07.375 --> 00:11:11.129 position:50% align:center
Hmph. As expected, you're
unclear on the concept.

00:11:11.212 --> 00:11:14.257 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] Seems my opponents
have doubled in number.

00:11:14.341 --> 00:11:16.259 position:50% align:center
It matters not.

00:11:16.343 --> 00:11:20.972 position:50% align:center
I now have something to
occupy all of these legs.

00:11:32.776 --> 00:11:35.653 position:50% align:center
This one's dangerous.
Stay behind me.

00:11:39.908 --> 00:11:42.952 position:50% align:center
It seems as though you
should stay behind me!

00:11:53.963 --> 00:11:55.131 position:50% align:center
They bounced off.

00:11:55.215 --> 00:11:57.467 position:50% align:center
Sergeant, are you sure
you even hit him?

00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:00.553 position:50% align:center
I have some real doubts
about your marksmanship.

00:12:00.637 --> 00:12:02.222 position:50% align:center
You lured Maki into
the Fire Force,

00:12:02.305 --> 00:12:04.933 position:50% align:center
though she's clearly not
cut out for that work.

00:12:05.016 --> 00:12:08.395 position:50% align:center
Your eye for judging people
is as poor as your aim.

00:12:13.233 --> 00:12:14.984 position:50% align:center
All this steam is from him?

00:12:15.068 --> 00:12:17.987 position:50% align:center
He must be some kind of
third-generation pyrokinetic

00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:20.115 position:50% align:center
who activates internally.

00:12:20.198 --> 00:12:22.784 position:50% align:center
[IRON]
That won't work! Nothing will!

00:12:22.867 --> 00:12:29.124 position:50% align:center
My body is harder than the
strongest steel! Oh, yeah!

00:12:29.207 --> 00:12:31.835 position:50% align:center
Martensite!

00:12:33.253 --> 00:12:36.840 position:50% align:center
No way! Is this guy
even human, or what?

00:12:38.675 --> 00:12:40.385 position:50% align:center
[IRON yells]

00:12:41.636 --> 00:12:46.975 position:50% align:center
Repels bullets and
smashes through concrete.

00:12:47.058 --> 00:12:50.228 position:50% align:center
He's hardened his body somehow.

00:12:50.311 --> 00:12:53.773 position:50% align:center
[IRON] Ironclad observation!
You are correct!

00:12:53.857 --> 00:12:57.736 position:50% align:center
You've heard of the process
of tempering metal, haven't you?

00:12:57.819 --> 00:13:00.280 position:50% align:center
By heating metal to a
very high temperature

00:13:00.363 --> 00:13:03.116 position:50% align:center
and then rapidly cooling it,
the metal develops into

00:13:03.199 --> 00:13:06.828 position:50% align:center
a super tough crystalline
structure called martensite.

00:13:06.911 --> 00:13:09.998 position:50% align:center
It becomes much stronger
than before it was heated.

00:13:10.081 --> 00:13:14.586 position:50% align:center
Using my pyrokinesis, I heat up
the iron content inside me,

00:13:14.669 --> 00:13:16.838 position:50% align:center
then, by quickly cooling myself,

00:13:16.921 --> 00:13:19.674 position:50% align:center
I can manipulate the
hardness of my body!

00:13:19.758 --> 00:13:21.926 position:50% align:center
I can make myself
harder than a rock!

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:25.764 position:50% align:center
My body literally becomes as
hard as the strongest steel!

00:13:25.847 --> 00:13:28.516 position:50% align:center
Check it out!

00:13:30.602 --> 00:13:32.020 position:50% align:center
Tell me, Sergeant!

00:13:32.103 --> 00:13:34.898 position:50% align:center
You had Maki go face to face
with monsters like this guy?

00:13:34.981 --> 00:13:36.983 position:50% align:center
We all trained
in man-to-man combat.

00:13:37.067 --> 00:13:39.569 position:50% align:center
Against men! Does
that apply to him?

00:13:39.652 --> 00:13:41.738 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA] If your opponent
has joints in his limbs,

00:13:41.821 --> 00:13:43.448 position:50% align:center
that's really all that matters.

00:13:43.531 --> 00:13:44.657 position:50% align:center
Look, Sergeant--

00:13:44.741 --> 00:13:46.993 position:50% align:center
I am a lieutenant with
the 8th these days.

00:13:47.077 --> 00:13:53.333 position:50% align:center
[IRON]
Flames! Parentheses extra-hard!

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:56.211 position:50% align:center
We'll come back to Maki later.

00:13:56.294 --> 00:13:58.755 position:50% align:center
We need to focus on
the enemy before us!

00:13:58.838 --> 00:14:00.173 position:50% align:center
At least, I wish I could.

00:14:00.256 --> 00:14:01.841 position:50% align:center
I've got questions
that need answers!

00:14:01.925 --> 00:14:03.385 position:50% align:center
Please try to focus.

00:14:03.468 --> 00:14:06.388 position:50% align:center
You obviously don't understand
the first thing about Maki!

00:14:06.471 --> 00:14:09.891 position:50% align:center
She's a sweet little flower
inside! She's not made for this!

00:14:09.974 --> 00:14:11.393 position:50% align:center
Get it together.

00:14:11.476 --> 00:14:14.104 position:50% align:center
The Fire Force claims to value
human life above all else,

00:14:14.187 --> 00:14:15.647 position:50% align:center
but I don't believe that's true!

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:18.608 position:50% align:center
You guys in the 8th are
addicted to fighting!

00:14:18.692 --> 00:14:22.696 position:50% align:center
You're just a bunch of savages.
Stay away from my family!

00:14:24.197 --> 00:14:27.450 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA] The 8th isn't full
of battle-hungry freaks.

00:14:27.534 --> 00:14:30.912 position:50% align:center
I mean, I happen to be one,
but not the 8th as a whole.

00:14:30.995 --> 00:14:35.083 position:50% align:center
You're all barbarians
who only deal in violence.

00:14:35.166 --> 00:14:37.335 position:50% align:center
Watch out! Get behind me!

00:14:38.294 --> 00:14:40.213 position:50% align:center
[TAKIGI]
We were right to pull Maki out.

00:14:40.296 --> 00:14:42.966 position:50% align:center
I won't let her get close
to danger again!

00:14:46.928 --> 00:14:49.014 position:50% align:center
She's not just some fragile
little girl anymore,

00:14:49.097 --> 00:14:50.015 position:50% align:center
Lieutenant Oze.

00:14:50.098 --> 00:14:51.558 position:50% align:center
No, I wouldn't think so.

00:14:51.641 --> 00:14:54.853 position:50% align:center
Not after what you and your
goons have put her through!

00:14:56.104 --> 00:14:57.480 position:50% align:center
[IRON]
Flames!

00:14:57.564 --> 00:15:01.234 position:50% align:center
Parentheses
extra-full-strength-hard!

00:15:07.198 --> 00:15:09.451 position:50% align:center
When are you gonna give up
on that peashooter, Sergeant?

00:15:09.534 --> 00:15:10.869 position:50% align:center
It doesn't do a damn thing!

00:15:10.952 --> 00:15:12.954 position:50% align:center
If I wanna hit his weak points,

00:15:13.038 --> 00:15:15.665 position:50% align:center
then I need to do it
before his guard's up.

00:15:15.749 --> 00:15:19.002 position:50% align:center
[IRON] Here comes...
flaming crispy-hard...!

00:15:19.085 --> 00:15:21.504 position:50% align:center
Would you shut up and
let me talk about my sister?

00:15:21.588 --> 00:15:25.508 position:50% align:center
I'm sick of your flames,
so I'll take them away!

00:15:25.592 --> 00:15:29.012 position:50% align:center
I think you need to
shut up, Lieutenant.

00:15:33.058 --> 00:15:35.018 position:50% align:center
Ricochet Control.

00:15:40.774 --> 00:15:43.109 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA] No matter how hard
you make your body,

00:15:43.193 --> 00:15:44.611 position:50% align:center
you can't do the same
with your joints

00:15:44.694 --> 00:15:47.072 position:50% align:center
if you still wanna move around.

00:15:47.155 --> 00:15:48.782 position:50% align:center
[IRON]
Got me there.

00:15:48.865 --> 00:15:52.118 position:50% align:center
That's the reason I couldn't
be a Pillar protector,

00:15:52.202 --> 00:15:56.331 position:50% align:center
even though I'm...
the hardest one.

00:15:56.414 --> 00:15:58.583 position:50% align:center
Not fair.

00:16:01.795 --> 00:16:03.922 position:50% align:center
[TAKIGI] If our family let
Maki stay with the 8th,

00:16:04.005 --> 00:16:07.842 position:50% align:center
she could've ended up
as freakish as this guy.

00:16:07.926 --> 00:16:09.678 position:50% align:center
Leave the Ozes alone.

00:16:09.761 --> 00:16:11.846 position:50% align:center
Just focus, would you?

00:16:16.976 --> 00:16:19.479 position:50% align:center
Ashes thou wert and art.

00:16:19.562 --> 00:16:21.564 position:50% align:center
May thy soul...

00:16:22.941 --> 00:16:27.696 position:50% align:center
...return to the great
flame of fire. <i>Látom</i> .

00:16:28.988 --> 00:16:31.741 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
Damn it, they just don't stop!

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:36.204 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
Juggernaut.

00:16:36.287 --> 00:16:37.372 position:50% align:center
Hang in there.

00:16:37.455 --> 00:16:40.125 position:50% align:center
I promise I'll get you
out of this place!

00:16:43.003 --> 00:16:45.088 position:50% align:center
[PURPLE HAZE A]
I don't see Orochi around.

00:16:45.171 --> 00:16:46.673 position:50% align:center
Where has she gone?

00:16:46.756 --> 00:16:49.509 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI] Two more of those
pointy hood guys?

00:16:49.592 --> 00:16:52.303 position:50% align:center
[PURPLE HAZE A]
Hold on. There's a survivor.

00:16:52.387 --> 00:16:56.850 position:50% align:center
[SASORI] Tell me, girl,
did you somehow defeat Orochi?

00:16:59.686 --> 00:17:01.730 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
They're too strong.

00:17:07.694 --> 00:17:09.863 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI] I don't have a
chance of beating them.

00:17:09.946 --> 00:17:13.950 position:50% align:center
The only thing I can do is run.

00:17:14.034 --> 00:17:18.246 position:50% align:center
But I'd only save myself.

00:17:18.329 --> 00:17:22.625 position:50% align:center
No! I can't leave
Juggernaut behind!

00:17:31.926 --> 00:17:34.179 position:50% align:center
[SASORI] I'm impressed that a
ridiculous little thing like you

00:17:34.262 --> 00:17:36.681 position:50% align:center
lasted so long in here.

00:17:36.765 --> 00:17:39.017 position:50% align:center
Were you lucky, or did
someone protect you?

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:42.729 position:50% align:center
Either way, your luck's
run out. Now die.

00:17:51.613 --> 00:17:53.531 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
Tamaki, are you okay?

00:17:53.615 --> 00:17:55.367 position:50% align:center
[IRIS]
Thank goodness!

00:17:56.868 --> 00:17:58.787 position:50% align:center
Juggernaut.

00:18:00.997 --> 00:18:03.875 position:50% align:center
You made me proud. Good work!

00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:06.002 position:50% align:center
But you gotta stay behind me.

00:18:06.086 --> 00:18:08.129 position:50% align:center
Captain Obi.

00:18:09.422 --> 00:18:11.299 position:50% align:center
[SASORI]
"Captain," eh?

00:18:12.634 --> 00:18:14.302 position:50% align:center
Well, how convenient.

00:18:14.386 --> 00:18:17.138 position:50% align:center
We were just about
to go hunting for you.

00:18:17.222 --> 00:18:18.848 position:50% align:center
I'm here now, pal.

00:18:18.932 --> 00:18:21.267 position:50% align:center
[SASORI]
Captain of the 8th.

00:18:21.351 --> 00:18:23.436 position:50% align:center
I wonder, what does an
unpowered buffoon like you

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.230 position:50% align:center
plan to do to we
who wield flames?

00:18:25.313 --> 00:18:28.024 position:50% align:center
Now, Captain Obi.
Keep your guard up!

00:18:28.108 --> 00:18:29.401 position:50% align:center
Ha!

00:18:29.484 --> 00:18:31.236 position:50% align:center
Until you can create enough
flame to light a match,

00:18:31.319 --> 00:18:33.571 position:50% align:center
you should stay
out of the Nether.

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:35.907 position:50% align:center
[SASORI yells]

00:18:48.545 --> 00:18:50.797 position:50% align:center
I train for this every day!

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.591 position:50% align:center
I train until my
muscles are on fire!

00:18:53.675 --> 00:18:56.344 position:50% align:center
[PURPLE HAZE A] He took out
Sasori with one blow?

00:18:56.428 --> 00:18:58.013 position:50% align:center
I beg your pardon.

00:18:58.096 --> 00:18:59.514 position:50% align:center
Even without powers,

00:18:59.597 --> 00:19:02.183 position:50% align:center
you still carry the weight
of the 8th on your shoulders.

00:19:02.267 --> 00:19:06.730 position:50% align:center
[PURPLE HAZE A] It's not over.
I won't go down so easily!

00:19:08.398 --> 00:19:10.859 position:50% align:center
[PURPLE HAZE A groans]

00:19:10.942 --> 00:19:12.694 position:50% align:center
Doskoi!

00:19:14.237 --> 00:19:17.949 position:50% align:center
Whoa. They're crazy strong.

00:19:18.033 --> 00:19:21.703 position:50% align:center
Guess there's a reason
they're both captains.

00:19:21.786 --> 00:19:23.496 position:50% align:center
[OBI] We got worried
when we lost contact

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:25.790 position:50% align:center
with Lieutenant Kagenashi.

00:19:25.874 --> 00:19:28.126 position:50% align:center
I'm glad you're okay.

00:19:28.209 --> 00:19:29.878 position:50% align:center
I'm so pathetic.

00:19:29.961 --> 00:19:33.631 position:50% align:center
I mean, I always need
someone to help me.

00:19:33.715 --> 00:19:37.552 position:50% align:center
If you and the others hadn't
come just now, I'd be dead.

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:40.055 position:50% align:center
It's fine.

00:19:40.138 --> 00:19:42.724 position:50% align:center
You must have a "Lucky Savior
Lure," too, don't ya?

00:19:44.934 --> 00:19:47.437 position:50% align:center
--No! I'm the worst!
--Uh. Hey, sorry.

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.147 position:50% align:center
--I'm no good!
--Wow, Vulcan.

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:53.193 position:50% align:center
Bad timing. That was not
what she needed to hear.

00:19:53.276 --> 00:19:56.488 position:50% align:center
[OBI] No. What makes a good
Fire Soldier is survival.

00:19:56.571 --> 00:19:58.365 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:19:58.448 --> 00:20:00.992 position:50% align:center
You're a valuable member
of the Fire Force.

00:20:01.076 --> 00:20:04.412 position:50% align:center
We're all alive to foil
the enemy's plans.

00:20:06.122 --> 00:20:07.707 position:50% align:center
Sir!

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:14.255 position:50% align:center
[HONDA] Get this message out
to every squad of Company 2!

00:20:14.339 --> 00:20:16.758 position:50% align:center
All units, assemble!

00:20:16.841 --> 00:20:19.594 position:50% align:center
[LICHT panting]

00:20:19.678 --> 00:20:22.722 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] All my life, people have
made fun of the way I run.

00:20:22.806 --> 00:20:25.600 position:50% align:center
That's why I hate
running so much.

00:20:25.684 --> 00:20:29.229 position:50% align:center
But right now, it's the only
thing keeping me alive.

00:20:29.312 --> 00:20:32.941 position:50% align:center
If those Infernals
catch me, I'm a goner!

00:20:33.024 --> 00:20:36.277 position:50% align:center
I can't croak before I learn
the truth about the world.

00:20:36.361 --> 00:20:41.074 position:50% align:center
So as ridiculous as I may look,
I gotta keep running.

00:20:42.701 --> 00:20:44.244 position:50% align:center
[LICHT yelps]

00:20:44.327 --> 00:20:45.161 position:50% align:center
[VOICE A]
Yeah...

00:20:45.245 --> 00:20:46.955 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI wheezes]

00:20:48.206 --> 00:20:49.249 position:50% align:center
Tamaki!

00:20:49.332 --> 00:20:50.792 position:50% align:center
Licht, it's you? Hey...

00:20:50.875 --> 00:20:54.379 position:50% align:center
First lechery, then heroics,
then back to lechery.

00:20:54.462 --> 00:20:55.922 position:50% align:center
Sounds exhausting.

00:20:56.006 --> 00:20:57.674 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
...at least show some gratitude!

00:20:57.757 --> 00:21:00.510 position:50% align:center
Hey, Licht, where
is Lieutenant Ohana?

00:21:00.593 --> 00:21:03.972 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Oh... uh, the whole
squad was wiped out.

00:21:04.055 --> 00:21:07.600 position:50% align:center
Well, everyone but me,
obviously. I just ran for it.

00:21:07.684 --> 00:21:09.894 position:50% align:center
Is that so?

00:21:09.978 --> 00:21:11.771 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
You got here just in time.

00:21:11.855 --> 00:21:13.106 position:50% align:center
Take a look at this.

00:21:13.189 --> 00:21:15.316 position:50% align:center
Can't even catch my breath.

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:16.985 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN] It's a graph
of the thermal sensors

00:21:17.068 --> 00:21:19.446 position:50% align:center
placed by each group.

00:21:19.529 --> 00:21:21.573 position:50% align:center
I think these heat
sources are Infernals,

00:21:21.656 --> 00:21:23.867 position:50% align:center
but they're so regulated.

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:25.702 position:50% align:center
If they're mindless Infernals,

00:21:25.785 --> 00:21:28.246 position:50% align:center
would they behave in
such an orderly fashion?

00:21:28.329 --> 00:21:30.457 position:50% align:center
I can't be sure from
just looking at this.

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:32.208 position:50% align:center
But it is strange.

00:21:32.292 --> 00:21:34.586 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN] The Infernals
suddenly stopped attacking.

00:21:34.669 --> 00:21:36.796 position:50% align:center
They've just fallen silent.

00:21:38.673 --> 00:21:42.469 position:50% align:center
Heat signatures of Infernals,
lined up at regular intervals.

00:21:42.552 --> 00:21:44.012 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:44.095 --> 00:21:45.597 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] The enemy's gonna blow
up everything in the Nether!

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:46.389 position:50% align:center
Are you serious?!

00:21:46.473 --> 00:21:47.724 position:50% align:center
Dead serious!

00:21:47.807 --> 00:21:50.727 position:50% align:center
Gotta do something! Immediately!

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:57.192 position:50% align:center
What pathetic fools.

00:21:57.275 --> 00:21:58.526 position:50% align:center
They never even suspected

00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:01.196 position:50% align:center
they were being lured
into our Nether trap.

00:22:01.279 --> 00:22:04.324 position:50% align:center
With my ability, Necro Pyro,

00:22:04.407 --> 00:22:08.536 position:50% align:center
I'll sink all of Tokyo
into the ground.

00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:10.830 position:50% align:center
I was lacking fuel earlier,

00:22:10.914 --> 00:22:13.708 position:50% align:center
but now I have these
infernalized Fire Soldiers--

00:22:13.792 --> 00:22:16.878 position:50% align:center
led in like lambs to slaughter.

00:22:16.961 --> 00:22:19.839 position:50% align:center
Lucky for us, they came down
here in large numbers,

00:22:19.923 --> 00:22:22.133 position:50% align:center
only to become my human bombs.

00:22:22.217 --> 00:22:24.469 position:50% align:center
It's beautiful.

00:22:24.552 --> 00:22:28.056 position:50% align:center
And now, we just need to
secure the Fourth Pillar:

00:22:28.139 --> 00:22:30.850 position:50% align:center
Shinra Kusakabe.

00:24:06.029 --> 00:24:09.366 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] The Tokyo Empire
will be annihilated.

00:24:09.449 --> 00:24:11.159 position:50% align:center
[IRIS]
