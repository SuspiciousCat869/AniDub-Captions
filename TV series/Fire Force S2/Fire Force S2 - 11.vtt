00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:32.615 position:50% align:center
[IRIS] Many years ago,
mankind faced a divine fury.

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:35.368 position:50% align:center
In an event known as
the Day of the Cataclysm,

00:00:35.452 --> 00:00:38.079 position:50% align:center
our entire world was burned.

00:00:38.163 --> 00:00:39.831 position:50% align:center
The fire raged with an intensity

00:00:39.914 --> 00:00:42.542 position:50% align:center
that threatened to
reduce mankind to ash.

00:00:42.625 --> 00:00:45.337 position:50% align:center
The places they lived,
the languages they spoke,

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.425 position:50% align:center
the culture they had built,
none could escape its wrath.

00:00:50.508 --> 00:00:53.261 position:50% align:center
As the world man had
built was buried in ash,

00:00:53.345 --> 00:00:55.555 position:50% align:center
a leader appeared.

00:00:55.638 --> 00:00:59.934 position:50% align:center
A man who would later be
known as Raffles the 1st.

00:01:00.018 --> 00:01:02.395 position:50% align:center
Raffles and his disciples
embarked on a quest

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:04.856 position:50% align:center
to find new light, and they did.

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:07.859 position:50% align:center
What Raffles found was
an unsullied flame.

00:01:07.942 --> 00:01:10.820 position:50% align:center
The spark that would
kindle an empire.

00:01:17.577 --> 00:01:19.996 position:50% align:center
[IRIS] Raffles saw at once
that the unsullied flame

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.165 position:50% align:center
was a gift from the great Sol.

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:24.918 position:50% align:center
He resolved to harness
its power with technology

00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:27.796 position:50% align:center
and created Amaterasu.

00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:30.423 position:50% align:center
By the light of
Amaterasu's sacred flame,

00:01:30.507 --> 00:01:32.384 position:50% align:center
the people began to rebuild.

00:01:32.467 --> 00:01:36.971 position:50% align:center
With its power, they established
a new state in the Far East.

00:02:26.771 --> 00:02:29.065 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] In the course
of our investigation,

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:30.608 position:50% align:center
we discovered a somewhat smaller

00:02:30.692 --> 00:02:32.902 position:50% align:center
and much older version
of Amaterasu.

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:34.320 position:50% align:center
The plant was functional.

00:02:34.404 --> 00:02:35.613 position:50% align:center
We determined that
it was powered

00:02:35.697 --> 00:02:38.199 position:50% align:center
by a person with
an Adolla Burst.

00:02:48.793 --> 00:02:51.963 position:50% align:center
Therefore, though we
can't prove it yet,

00:02:52.047 --> 00:02:54.841 position:50% align:center
we suspect that Amaterasu
works the same way.

00:02:54.924 --> 00:02:57.052 position:50% align:center
My guess is that it's
powered by the girl

00:02:57.135 --> 00:02:58.178 position:50% align:center
I linked with at the 4th--

00:02:58.261 --> 00:03:00.597 position:50% align:center
who we believe to be
the First Pillar.

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:03.308 position:50% align:center
Hold on.

00:03:03.391 --> 00:03:04.726 position:50% align:center
What would that tell us
about the scriptures

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:06.936 position:50% align:center
of the Holy Sol Temple?

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:12.901 position:50% align:center
Either I'm misreading something,

00:03:12.984 --> 00:03:16.321 position:50% align:center
or the scriptures are incorrect
on several major points.

00:03:17.364 --> 00:03:18.907 position:50% align:center
Just about everyone
in the Empire

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.785 position:50% align:center
was raised to have faith
in those teachings.

00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:23.536 position:50% align:center
Are you sayin'
they're all made up?

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.080 position:50% align:center
You're damn right they are!

00:03:25.163 --> 00:03:27.957 position:50% align:center
It's my family that built
Amaterasu, remember?

00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:30.502 position:50% align:center
The Temple doesn't
even mention us.

00:03:31.586 --> 00:03:33.129 position:50% align:center
But to think that
there's a living person

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:35.674 position:50% align:center
burning up inside of there...

00:03:35.757 --> 00:03:38.802 position:50% align:center
Just what were my
ancestors involved with?

00:03:40.261 --> 00:03:42.555 position:50% align:center
If the Temple really is lying,

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:44.224 position:50% align:center
then the question is
whether it might have

00:03:44.307 --> 00:03:47.519 position:50% align:center
some secret connection
to the Evangelist.

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:55.151 position:50% align:center
Shinra. Arthur. Tamaki.

00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:58.113 position:50% align:center
Great work out there.
You've done us proud.

00:03:58.196 --> 00:04:00.407 position:50% align:center
I'll report this to the
brass as soon as possible

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.702 position:50% align:center
and see how they wanna proceed.

00:04:03.785 --> 00:04:04.828 position:50% align:center
We done here?

00:04:04.911 --> 00:04:06.705 position:50% align:center
Yes, that concludes
today's meeting.

00:04:06.788 --> 00:04:09.374 position:50% align:center
You can now all
resume normal duties.

00:04:14.087 --> 00:04:15.588 position:50% align:center
[IRIS grunts]

00:04:15.672 --> 00:04:18.341 position:50% align:center
That was a lot. Are you okay?

00:04:18.425 --> 00:04:22.470 position:50% align:center
Someone might be burning alive
so that our country can prosper.

00:04:22.554 --> 00:04:24.806 position:50% align:center
It's not an easy pill
to swallow for anyone,

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:27.809 position:50% align:center
and that goes
double for us nuns.

00:04:27.892 --> 00:04:29.060 position:50% align:center
So what does this mean?

00:04:29.144 --> 00:04:31.312 position:50% align:center
Sir, do you think
the Temple is evil?

00:04:31.396 --> 00:04:33.481 position:50% align:center
Someone inside might be.

00:04:33.565 --> 00:04:36.026 position:50% align:center
But even so, the Temple
does more than most

00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:38.695 position:50% align:center
to lift up the
Empire's populace.

00:04:38.778 --> 00:04:42.073 position:50% align:center
I'm grateful for Sol's
blessings, no matter what.

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:45.577 position:50% align:center
Thanks for the
reassurance, sir.

00:04:46.995 --> 00:04:49.122 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
I have to find the truth.

00:04:49.205 --> 00:04:52.167 position:50% align:center
For Iris and devout
believers like her.

00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:38.421 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:39.964 position:50% align:center
There's no doubt about it.

00:05:40.048 --> 00:05:42.467 position:50% align:center
Our knight-king was
right on the mark.

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.220 position:50% align:center
It's the legend
of Sir Cumference.

00:05:47.305 --> 00:05:48.932 position:50% align:center
Trouble is, I still have no idea

00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:52.018 position:50% align:center
what pi has to do
with Amaterasu.

00:06:07.033 --> 00:06:08.618 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] The Holy Sol
Temple's scriptures

00:06:08.702 --> 00:06:10.870 position:50% align:center
are just a pack of lies.

00:06:10.954 --> 00:06:15.000 position:50% align:center
Lies which are baked into the
foundation Tokyo was built on.

00:06:16.292 --> 00:06:18.878 position:50% align:center
And now, there's no way
to dig those lies out

00:06:18.962 --> 00:06:21.923 position:50% align:center
without destabilizing
the country.

00:06:22.007 --> 00:06:24.759 position:50% align:center
If what we've discovered here
becomes public knowledge,

00:06:24.843 --> 00:06:27.637 position:50% align:center
it'll send some serious
waves through the Empire.

00:06:27.721 --> 00:06:30.557 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you aren't wrong.
This intel's sensitive.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.976 position:50% align:center
We need to treat it
with due caution.

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:36.896 position:50% align:center
Well, it's not like going public
with the truth is a real option.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.773 position:50% align:center
The story'll just get
brushed under the rug

00:06:38.857 --> 00:06:40.817 position:50% align:center
and that'll be that.

00:06:47.782 --> 00:06:49.409 position:50% align:center
[LIGHT]
Seems I've done everything I can

00:06:49.492 --> 00:06:51.411 position:50% align:center
with the Fire Force.

00:06:52.912 --> 00:06:54.247 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:06:55.999 --> 00:06:59.085 position:50% align:center
Guess I should start
playing a little rougher.

00:07:15.643 --> 00:07:18.396 position:50% align:center
You're gonna break into
the Holy Sol Temple?

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.608 position:50% align:center
Just to pray, right?
You're keeping it wholesome?

00:07:24.027 --> 00:07:26.613 position:50% align:center
[JOKER]
Why don't you come and see?

00:07:26.696 --> 00:07:30.075 position:50% align:center
All right, enough
with the allusions.

00:07:30.158 --> 00:07:31.701 position:50% align:center
Who are you?

00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:38.249 position:50% align:center
Just call me a dark hero.

00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:20.560 position:50% align:center
You're aware the Temple is
hiding something, right?

00:09:20.643 --> 00:09:22.437 position:50% align:center
Don't you find that suspicious?

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.315 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU] No more
suspicious than I find you.

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:53.301 position:50% align:center
That said, you do
have my attention.

00:09:53.385 --> 00:09:56.054 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:09:56.137 --> 00:09:59.015 position:50% align:center
So, why'd you ask me to come?

00:09:59.099 --> 00:10:00.433 position:50% align:center
[JOKER] Because you've
already had a taste

00:10:00.517 --> 00:10:02.811 position:50% align:center
of the Temple's true nature.

00:10:02.894 --> 00:10:06.856 position:50% align:center
It's behind the oppression of
you proto-nationalists, right?

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:10.193 position:50% align:center
I was hopin' you might
have a grudge to settle.

00:10:15.782 --> 00:10:16.950 position:50% align:center
What do you say?

00:10:17.033 --> 00:10:19.744 position:50% align:center
I know you're an Imperial
Fire Soldier now,

00:10:19.828 --> 00:10:22.330 position:50% align:center
but does that mean you're
on the Emperor's leash?

00:10:22.414 --> 00:10:23.707 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:10:34.634 --> 00:10:35.719 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER A]
This is an announcement

00:10:35.802 --> 00:10:38.054 position:50% align:center
from Armed Forces
Security Enforcement.

00:10:38.138 --> 00:10:41.391 position:50% align:center
Please refrain from giving
money to solicitors.

00:10:41.474 --> 00:10:43.977 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] What is right
and what is wrong?

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.312 position:50% align:center
It's an age-old question.

00:10:46.396 --> 00:10:49.232 position:50% align:center
And the answer's still
out of my grasp.

00:10:52.527 --> 00:10:54.738 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] I can't settle
for some vague concept

00:10:54.821 --> 00:10:57.073 position:50% align:center
revealed by a god.

00:10:57.157 --> 00:10:59.325 position:50% align:center
The real truth is out there,

00:10:59.409 --> 00:11:02.579 position:50% align:center
and it transcends all
concepts of divinity.

00:11:02.662 --> 00:11:06.332 position:50% align:center
I'll start with the truth
behind human combustion.

00:11:06.416 --> 00:11:09.753 position:50% align:center
And then, I'll find out what's
happening to our world.

00:11:29.356 --> 00:11:30.732 position:50% align:center
Hey, Licht.

00:11:30.815 --> 00:11:33.151 position:50% align:center
I just finished reading your
paper on human combustion.

00:11:33.234 --> 00:11:34.778 position:50% align:center
Color me impressed.

00:11:34.861 --> 00:11:38.406 position:50% align:center
I'm curious what prompted you
to look into that theory.

00:11:42.619 --> 00:11:44.996 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.915 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:11:46.998 --> 00:11:49.834 position:50% align:center
Hey, is something wrong?

00:11:51.795 --> 00:11:55.006 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Stop. I'm fine.

00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:58.051 position:50% align:center
I'm just looking
for an answer, okay?

00:11:59.886 --> 00:12:02.389 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] All I want is
the objective truth.

00:12:02.472 --> 00:12:04.641 position:50% align:center
Something I can trust.

00:12:09.145 --> 00:12:11.856 position:50% align:center
I take it this is
your brand of justice?

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:14.609 position:50% align:center
Not bad, Viktor Licht.

00:12:14.693 --> 00:12:16.611 position:50% align:center
You found me again, huh?

00:12:16.695 --> 00:12:19.656 position:50% align:center
Look, justice is a fuzzy
concept. I don't need it.

00:12:19.739 --> 00:12:21.991 position:50% align:center
I'm searching for
a concrete truth.

00:12:22.075 --> 00:12:24.369 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:12:24.452 --> 00:12:27.831 position:50% align:center
A hero deals in
truth and justice.

00:12:59.529 --> 00:13:00.613 position:50% align:center
[bang]

00:13:00.697 --> 00:13:02.449 position:50% align:center
They're keeping it
secret? But why, sir?

00:13:02.532 --> 00:13:04.492 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
The obvious reasons.

00:13:04.576 --> 00:13:07.495 position:50% align:center
The facts you uncovered on that
mission are disturbing enough

00:13:07.579 --> 00:13:09.998 position:50% align:center
that they might cause
the people to panic.

00:13:10.081 --> 00:13:11.291 position:50% align:center
So before we go public,

00:13:11.374 --> 00:13:13.626 position:50% align:center
we have to follow
certain procedures.

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:15.962 position:50% align:center
They think it'll
make people panic?

00:13:16.046 --> 00:13:19.591 position:50% align:center
I hate this as much as you do,
but the decision has been made.

00:13:19.674 --> 00:13:21.509 position:50% align:center
We're gonna have to
wait for three years.

00:13:21.593 --> 00:13:23.595 position:50% align:center
The brass says that's how
long it'll take the church

00:13:23.678 --> 00:13:26.765 position:50% align:center
to reveal the truth themselves
without causing chaos.

00:13:26.848 --> 00:13:29.351 position:50% align:center
What? They want three years?

00:13:29.434 --> 00:13:30.560 position:50% align:center
Hang on.

00:13:30.643 --> 00:13:31.770 position:50% align:center
They're ordering us to
keep our mouths shut

00:13:31.853 --> 00:13:33.521 position:50% align:center
and pretend that
everything's fine?

00:13:33.605 --> 00:13:35.482 position:50% align:center
Three years is way
too long, sir!

00:13:35.565 --> 00:13:36.816 position:50% align:center
If we have to hide our findings,

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:38.276 position:50% align:center
then why did we even
investigate this...?

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.695 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] It's not unusual for
the truth to be suppressed

00:13:40.779 --> 00:13:42.989 position:50% align:center
in order to preserve
the status quo.

00:13:43.073 --> 00:13:46.409 position:50% align:center
These "Imperial dogs"
just got kenneled.

00:13:46.493 --> 00:13:51.331 position:50% align:center

looking for him, too.

What's he up to?

00:14:09.182 --> 00:14:11.851 position:50% align:center
Even when he's on a bender,
he doesn't stay out this late.

00:14:11.935 --> 00:14:12.977 position:50% align:center
That jerk.

00:14:13.061 --> 00:14:14.479 position:50% align:center

he'll come back home

00:14:14.562 --> 00:14:16.314 position:50% align:center

for breakfast.

a little too quiet lately.

[BENIMARU]
So this is it.

00:14:45.844 --> 00:14:48.513 position:50% align:center
[JOKER] As you can see,
the approach is exposed

00:14:48.596 --> 00:14:50.890 position:50% align:center

00:14:50.974 --> 00:14:54.436 position:50% align:center

quite an option.

With that in mind,

I don't give a damn about

I have a right to know
what's really going on here.

doesn't want us to see.

you know about them?

00:17:44.647 --> 00:17:46.316 position:50% align:center

on the discipline

00:17:48.777 --> 00:17:52.572 position:50% align:center
Societies were united by the

In somewhat more recent times,

00:17:54.449 --> 00:17:56.576 position:50% align:center
