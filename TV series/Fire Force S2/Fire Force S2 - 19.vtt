00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.268 position:50% align:center
[DANRO]
What?

00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:20.687 position:50% align:center
Leaving the army?

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.897 position:50% align:center
[MAKI] There's a new company
that's still understaffed--

00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:25.442 position:50% align:center
it seems like they need
all the help they can get.

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:27.902 position:50% align:center
I thought it'd be a great place
for someone as green as I am

00:00:27.986 --> 00:00:29.487 position:50% align:center
to get started.

00:00:29.571 --> 00:00:32.282 position:50% align:center
You're not happy with
your work in the military?

00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:33.950 position:50% align:center
[MAKI]
Mh-mh.

00:00:35.326 --> 00:00:37.412 position:50% align:center
I think I'd do a better
job of protecting people

00:00:37.495 --> 00:00:39.748 position:50% align:center
as part of the Fire Force.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.305 position:50% align:center
General Oze, we've received
our periodic report

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:21.266 position:50% align:center
from the Special Fire Force.

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:22.851 position:50% align:center
Oh?

00:02:24.894 --> 00:02:26.271 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:02:30.275 --> 00:02:32.986 position:50% align:center
The Special Fire Force, you say?

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.864 position:50% align:center
They have something to tell us?

00:02:35.947 --> 00:02:37.574 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:02:40.285 --> 00:02:42.704 position:50% align:center
Uh, yes, sir.

00:02:44.497 --> 00:02:45.540 position:50% align:center
Man, he's scary.

00:02:45.623 --> 00:02:47.792 position:50% align:center
Hm? Is something the matter?

00:02:47.876 --> 00:02:50.545 position:50% align:center
Oh, uh, I was delivering
the periodic report

00:02:50.628 --> 00:02:54.966 position:50% align:center
from the Special Fire Force, and
General Oze was pretty intense.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.261 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, been there before.

00:02:58.345 --> 00:03:00.263 position:50% align:center
His daughter's a cutie,
though, huh?

00:03:00.347 --> 00:03:02.265 position:50% align:center
She still at Yokota Air Base?

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.768 position:50% align:center
Actually, I heard
she left the military.

00:03:04.851 --> 00:03:07.437 position:50% align:center
She joined Special
Fire Force Company 8.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.106 position:50% align:center
Over his objections, of course.

00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:27.248 position:50% align:center
[MAKI]
Hm?

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.127 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:35.965 position:50% align:center
Have I always been this beefy?

00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:43.890 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:03:47.894 --> 00:03:49.187 position:50% align:center
Hey, I'm here!

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.690 position:50% align:center
[MAID A] Goodness. I wasn't
expecting you so soon.

00:03:51.773 --> 00:03:54.651 position:50% align:center
[TAKIGI] Well, I went in early,
and my relief did, too, so.

00:03:54.734 --> 00:03:56.695 position:50% align:center
[MAID A]
I'll take your coat.

00:03:56.778 --> 00:03:59.698 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:03:59.781 --> 00:04:02.617 position:50% align:center
The CID is no walk in the park.

00:04:05.453 --> 00:04:07.914 position:50% align:center
[MAID A] Your mother is getting
dinner ready right now.

00:04:07.997 --> 00:04:09.040 position:50% align:center
It's been quite a while

00:04:09.124 --> 00:04:11.376 position:50% align:center
since the whole family's
gotten together.

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.837 position:50% align:center
Yeah. It sure has.

00:04:19.926 --> 00:04:21.886 position:50% align:center
Wow, this is amazing!

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.139 position:50% align:center
You're really throwing
a big feast here, Mom!

00:04:24.222 --> 00:04:26.599 position:50% align:center
Well, we are all eating
together tonight.

00:04:26.683 --> 00:04:29.185 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Hi, sweetie!

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:32.105 position:50% align:center
[MAKI]
Dad!

00:04:32.188 --> 00:04:34.065 position:50% align:center
[grumbles]

00:04:35.817 --> 00:04:37.569 position:50% align:center
It's been so long since
we've had dinner

00:04:37.652 --> 00:04:40.530 position:50% align:center
with our sweet little baby!

00:04:40.613 --> 00:04:42.657 position:50% align:center
Mom really went
for it, didn't she?

00:04:42.741 --> 00:04:44.325 position:50% align:center
You think we can eat it all?

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:47.162 position:50% align:center
General Oze, scowling
guardian of the Empire,

00:04:47.245 --> 00:04:48.997 position:50% align:center
is no match for his daughter.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.789 position:50% align:center
[DANRO coughs]

00:04:49.873 --> 00:04:52.125 position:50% align:center
Yes, well. Hello, Takigi.

00:04:52.208 --> 00:04:55.462 position:50% align:center
I'm glad he goes from
"General" to "Dad" at home.

00:04:55.545 --> 00:04:58.340 position:50% align:center
Dig in before it
gets cold everyone.

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:01.426 position:50% align:center
Oh, it's so good!

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:03.136 position:50% align:center
You've outdone yourself again.

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:06.389 position:50% align:center
Few things in life are better
than a real family dinner.

00:05:06.473 --> 00:05:07.557 position:50% align:center
The lieutenant's the only one

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.476 position:50% align:center
who can come close
to Mom's cooking.

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:11.686 position:50% align:center
[DANRO]
Hmm? The lieutenant?

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.855 position:50% align:center
Hinawa, wasn't it?

00:05:13.938 --> 00:05:14.981 position:50% align:center
The same man who lured you

00:05:15.065 --> 00:05:17.609 position:50% align:center
into that dangerous
Fire Force racket?

00:05:17.692 --> 00:05:19.361 position:50% align:center
[MAKI]
Aw, don't worry.

00:05:19.444 --> 00:05:22.197 position:50% align:center
I'm not a puny little
thing anymore.

00:05:23.948 --> 00:05:25.325 position:50% align:center
Twin Cobras--

00:05:25.408 --> 00:05:27.952 position:50% align:center
[TAKIGI] Yeah, I guess you have
put on some weight, huh?

00:05:28.036 --> 00:05:29.579 position:50% align:center
That's totally uncalled for.

00:05:29.662 --> 00:05:31.414 position:50% align:center
Well, then let's see 'em again.

00:05:31.498 --> 00:05:32.791 position:50% align:center
They're like, as big as my--

00:05:32.874 --> 00:05:34.334 position:50% align:center
[MAKI] They're not that big!
You can't say stuff...

00:05:34.417 --> 00:05:38.171 position:50% align:center
Taki, please don't point your
fork at your sister, okay?

00:05:38.254 --> 00:05:42.384 position:50% align:center
Maki, are you sure you aren't
overdoing your weight training?

00:05:42.467 --> 00:05:44.636 position:50% align:center
Careful you don't scare
all the guys away.

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:47.222 position:50% align:center
[MAKI] Do you have to
be such a butthead?

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.892 position:50% align:center
I know that someday, a handsome
prince on a white horse

00:05:50.975 --> 00:05:53.019 position:50% align:center
will come along and
sweep me off my feet!

00:05:53.103 --> 00:05:54.979 position:50% align:center
My little girl may
be as tough as nails,

00:05:55.063 --> 00:05:57.232 position:50% align:center
but she still believes
in fairy tales.

00:05:57.315 --> 00:05:58.316 position:50% align:center
[BOTH chuckle]

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.901 position:50% align:center
[TAKIGI]
Easy to see where she gets it.

00:05:59.984 --> 00:06:02.696 position:50% align:center
Try not to get so carried away
while we're eating, you two.

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:04.489 position:50% align:center
Oh, my girlfriend.

00:06:04.572 --> 00:06:05.990 position:50% align:center
It's Taki-waki.

00:06:06.074 --> 00:06:08.535 position:50% align:center
Having a widdle din-din with
my par-wents wight now!

00:06:08.618 --> 00:06:11.621 position:50% align:center
Can he not see it in himself?
Stop with all the stupid...

00:06:11.705 --> 00:06:14.249 position:50% align:center
It is so nice to talk
with each other,

00:06:14.332 --> 00:06:16.626 position:50% align:center
but please try to
mind your manners.

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.254 position:50% align:center
[MAKI] Does your girlfriend
actually like that?

00:06:20.547 --> 00:06:24.134 position:50% align:center
Hey, you jerks! I told you to
mind your freakin' manners!

00:06:26.428 --> 00:06:28.096 position:50% align:center
[DANRO]
What a lovely meal, darling.

00:06:28.179 --> 00:06:29.014 position:50% align:center
[MAKI]
Tis!

00:06:29.097 --> 00:06:30.765 position:50% align:center
[TAKIGI]
This steak is exquisite.

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:34.144 position:50% align:center
[DANRO] Oh, Maki was such
a cute little girl.

00:06:38.356 --> 00:06:39.858 position:50% align:center
[TAKIGI]
Oh, thank you.

00:06:39.941 --> 00:06:43.153 position:50% align:center
Hey, you've been to the Nether
before, haven't you?

00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:43.987 position:50% align:center
[MAKI]
Mh-hm.

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.364 position:50% align:center
Is this about your new case?

00:06:46.448 --> 00:06:47.824 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh.

00:06:47.907 --> 00:06:50.952 position:50% align:center
We've had a lot of people
go missing in this one area,

00:06:51.036 --> 00:06:53.621 position:50% align:center
and there's talk--
reports of strange smells

00:06:53.705 --> 00:06:56.416 position:50% align:center
coming from the
Nether around there.

00:06:56.499 --> 00:06:58.710 position:50% align:center
That place is super scary.

00:06:58.793 --> 00:07:02.047 position:50% align:center
I've heard the 8th had a fairly
significant enemy engagement

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:03.590 position:50% align:center
in the Nether.

00:07:04.716 --> 00:07:08.553 position:50% align:center
Lotta rumors about
what you've been up to.

00:07:08.636 --> 00:07:11.097 position:50% align:center
These investigations are
another part of our duty

00:07:11.181 --> 00:07:12.474 position:50% align:center
as Fire Soldiers.

00:07:12.557 --> 00:07:14.517 position:50% align:center
And how's that going?

00:07:19.022 --> 00:07:21.316 position:50% align:center
Company 8's extremely strong.

00:07:21.399 --> 00:07:23.818 position:50% align:center
I mean, of course the captain
and lieutenant are tough,

00:07:23.902 --> 00:07:25.987 position:50% align:center
but even our rookies are
the cream of the crop,

00:07:26.071 --> 00:07:29.449 position:50% align:center
and we have one of the world's
top engineers with us, too.

00:07:33.703 --> 00:07:35.705 position:50% align:center
[grumbles]

00:07:50.637 --> 00:07:52.597 position:50% align:center
[TAKIGI'S PARTNER] We can
access the Nether here, right?

00:07:52.681 --> 00:07:55.517 position:50% align:center
[TAKIGI] I'm shocked we
actually got a search warrant.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.894 position:50% align:center
They seem serious
about the Evangelist.

00:07:57.977 --> 00:08:02.065 position:50% align:center
The Empire's taking them as a
credible threat, at the least.

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:03.650 position:50% align:center
You went back home yesterday?

00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:07.237 position:50% align:center
It's the first family dinner
we've had together in a while.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:08.822 position:50% align:center
[TAKIGI'S PARTNER]
So Maki was there, too.

00:08:08.905 --> 00:08:10.949 position:50% align:center
Did she talk about
the Nether at all?

00:08:11.032 --> 00:08:11.950 position:50% align:center
[TAKIGI]
Yeah.

00:08:12.033 --> 00:08:14.202 position:50% align:center
She never wants to
come here again.

00:08:14.285 --> 00:08:16.246 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:24.587 position:50% align:center
Watch yourself.

00:08:24.671 --> 00:08:27.298 position:50% align:center
This place looks like
it's about to fall apart.

00:08:27.382 --> 00:08:29.300 position:50% align:center
The reports mentioned
strange smells

00:08:29.384 --> 00:08:31.803 position:50% align:center
that were coming up
from the Nether.

00:08:31.886 --> 00:08:33.388 position:50% align:center
Well, ya know,

00:08:33.471 --> 00:08:38.184 position:50% align:center
there was a ton of stuff down
here before the Great Cataclysm.

00:08:38.268 --> 00:08:41.229 position:50% align:center
Ugh. Can't believe I'm
actually in the Nether.

00:08:41.312 --> 00:08:44.149 position:50% align:center
My mother's probably
turning over in her grave.

00:08:44.232 --> 00:08:47.360 position:50% align:center
[TAKIGI] They said the smell
was coming from that direction.

00:08:50.071 --> 00:08:51.781 position:50% align:center
[TAKIGI'S PARTNER]
This place is a friggin' maze.

00:08:51.865 --> 00:08:53.408 position:50% align:center
Halls everywhere.

00:08:53.491 --> 00:08:56.453 position:50% align:center
It'd be better to turn
back now than get lost.

00:08:56.536 --> 00:08:58.830 position:50% align:center
You ain't lyin'.

00:08:58.913 --> 00:09:00.415 position:50% align:center
Hey, wait.

00:09:00.498 --> 00:09:04.419 position:50% align:center
These tracks in the dirt. Looks
like something was dragged off.

00:09:04.502 --> 00:09:06.296 position:50% align:center
They're still pretty fresh.

00:09:06.379 --> 00:09:08.590 position:50% align:center
They keep on goin' that way.

00:09:10.467 --> 00:09:13.386 position:50% align:center
[TAKIGI'S PARTNER]
"Equipment room." Is this it?

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:14.262 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:14.346 --> 00:09:16.264 position:50% align:center
I can hear something in there.

00:09:23.772 --> 00:09:25.148 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:31.446 position:50% align:center
The hell? What is this?

00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:37.035 position:50% align:center
[TAKIGI'S PARTNER]
What's goin' on in here?

00:09:37.118 --> 00:09:39.120 position:50% align:center
Some kinda laboratory?

00:09:39.204 --> 00:09:40.705 position:50% align:center
[TAKIGI]
No idea.

00:09:40.789 --> 00:09:42.123 position:50% align:center
You know as well as I do

00:09:42.207 --> 00:09:45.418 position:50% align:center
the military has zero
reliable intel on this place.

00:09:46.461 --> 00:09:47.962 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:48.046 --> 00:09:48.838 position:50% align:center
You see that over there?

00:09:48.922 --> 00:09:50.340 position:50% align:center
[TAKIGI'S PARTNER]
Huh?

00:09:52.592 --> 00:09:54.052 position:50% align:center
[TAKIGI'S PARTNER]
Insects.

00:09:54.135 --> 00:09:56.346 position:50% align:center
I've read about these
things in my research,

00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:59.099 position:50% align:center
but I never thought I'd see one.

00:09:59.182 --> 00:10:02.268 position:50% align:center
Apparently, the White-Clad have
been using these insects

00:10:02.352 --> 00:10:05.313 position:50% align:center
to artificially
create Infernals.

00:10:05.397 --> 00:10:07.899 position:50% align:center
[TAKIGI'S PARTNER] So this
really is a White-Clad lab.

00:10:07.982 --> 00:10:09.651 position:50% align:center
[TAKIGI]
Yeah, I'd bet on that.

00:10:09.734 --> 00:10:11.444 position:50% align:center
Let's see what else we can find.

00:10:11.528 --> 00:10:13.613 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:10:13.697 --> 00:10:15.156 position:50% align:center
[TAKIGI]
Who's there?

00:10:16.116 --> 00:10:17.909 position:50% align:center
All right, stay sharp.

00:10:17.992 --> 00:10:19.869 position:50% align:center
Uh. Right.

00:10:19.953 --> 00:10:21.746 position:50% align:center
--[crunch]
--Huh?

00:10:22.997 --> 00:10:24.666 position:50% align:center
Charred corpse?

00:10:24.749 --> 00:10:26.751 position:50% align:center
No, an Infernal.

00:10:26.835 --> 00:10:30.171 position:50% align:center
What the hell? Its core's
intact, but it's dead.

00:10:32.048 --> 00:10:33.633 position:50% align:center
[bang]

00:10:33.717 --> 00:10:36.011 position:50% align:center
[TAKIGI] Come on out!
We know you're there!

00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:41.141 position:50% align:center
--Bomb!
--[TAKIGI] Get back!

00:10:49.983 --> 00:10:52.694 position:50% align:center
[TAKIGI'S PARTNER groans]

00:10:52.777 --> 00:10:55.697 position:50% align:center
[TAKIGI'S PARTNER coughing]

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:59.367 position:50% align:center
Hey. Hey!

00:10:59.451 --> 00:11:01.286 position:50% align:center
Oze!

00:11:04.581 --> 00:11:08.168 position:50% align:center
[TAKIGI'S PARTNER] Burns to the
right arm, fractured left arm,

00:11:08.251 --> 00:11:11.671 position:50% align:center
facial lacerations,
and bruising all over.

00:11:11.755 --> 00:11:13.173 position:50% align:center
You're lookin' at three
months of recovery,

00:11:13.256 --> 00:11:15.633 position:50% align:center
but you're lucky to be alive.

00:11:15.717 --> 00:11:18.053 position:50% align:center
I'm just happy
you're okay, buddy.

00:11:18.136 --> 00:11:20.889 position:50% align:center
It's all thanks to you.

00:11:20.972 --> 00:11:22.807 position:50% align:center
[TAKIGI]
And what about the scene?

00:11:22.891 --> 00:11:26.353 position:50% align:center
[TAKIGI'S PARTNER] The suicide
bomber completely destroyed it.

00:11:26.436 --> 00:11:29.189 position:50% align:center
So that's the White-Clad, huh.

00:11:29.272 --> 00:11:33.401 position:50% align:center
I knew they were dangerous, but
it's much worse than I thought.

00:11:33.485 --> 00:11:37.989 position:50% align:center
It's crazy. These are the guys
that Maki's goin' up against?

00:11:38.073 --> 00:11:40.283 position:50% align:center
I can't believe that this
Lieutenant Hinawa was able

00:11:40.367 --> 00:11:43.745 position:50% align:center
to rope my little sister
into whatever all this is.

00:11:47.248 --> 00:11:50.126 position:50% align:center
[DANRO]
I see. So my son is all right.

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:54.673 position:50% align:center
But it's troubling. The hell's
going on in the Nether?

00:11:55.799 --> 00:11:58.051 position:50% align:center
[DANRO] Thus far, all
military organizations

00:11:58.134 --> 00:12:01.429 position:50% align:center
have been left in the dark
concerning the White-Clad.

00:12:03.181 --> 00:12:06.601 position:50% align:center
[DANRO] However, as
defenders of this Empire,

00:12:06.685 --> 00:12:10.689 position:50% align:center
it is imperative that we
be enlightened at once.

00:12:10.772 --> 00:12:13.858 position:50% align:center
Get me Captain Honda
with Company 2!

00:12:13.942 --> 00:12:18.613 position:50% align:center
Surely he wants to make
progress on this as well.

00:12:18.697 --> 00:12:22.826 position:50% align:center
I'm giving the 2nd a mission
to investigate the Nether.

00:12:36.172 --> 00:12:38.758 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR] Thanks for always
keeping watch, Sil-burro.

00:12:38.842 --> 00:12:40.927 position:50% align:center
Are you really still
doing that bit?

00:12:41.011 --> 00:12:42.429 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
Hmph.

00:12:42.512 --> 00:12:45.015 position:50% align:center
Hinawa's vile experiments made
Sil-burro grow bull horns

00:12:45.098 --> 00:12:47.142 position:50% align:center
and left my steed traumatized.

00:12:47.225 --> 00:12:49.144 position:50% align:center
But now that the benevolent
Knight King Arthur

00:12:49.227 --> 00:12:50.603 position:50% align:center
has taken him in, he's happy.

00:12:50.687 --> 00:12:52.522 position:50% align:center
[SIL-BURRO grunting]

00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:53.648 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:12:53.732 --> 00:12:54.816 position:50% align:center
I can't believe you
went and put trash

00:12:54.899 --> 00:12:56.735 position:50% align:center
in his mouth like that again.

00:12:56.818 --> 00:12:57.986 position:50% align:center
You depraved devil!

00:12:58.069 --> 00:12:59.446 position:50% align:center
How can you abuse a poor
defenseless animal?

00:12:59.529 --> 00:13:01.281 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Just take that ugly thing down!

00:13:01.364 --> 00:13:02.574 position:50% align:center
And why the hell would...

00:13:02.657 --> 00:13:05.660 position:50% align:center
Some things never change.

00:13:05.744 --> 00:13:08.955 position:50% align:center
Hey, Sil-burro.
Time for a little snack!

00:13:10.248 --> 00:13:12.375 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
See, I told you it wasn't me!

00:13:12.459 --> 00:13:14.210 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR] Hmph. How could I
ever trust what a devil...

00:13:14.294 --> 00:13:17.213 position:50% align:center
I remember Vulcan telling us
donkeys don't eat paper.

00:13:17.297 --> 00:13:18.882 position:50% align:center
Shouldn't feed it
to them or goats.

00:13:18.965 --> 00:13:21.593 position:50% align:center
I thought that goats were
supposed to eat everything.

00:13:21.676 --> 00:13:24.012 position:50% align:center
So is this a typical
morning at the 8th?

00:13:24.095 --> 00:13:26.598 position:50% align:center
They're all idiots.

00:13:26.681 --> 00:13:28.641 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Hinawa.

00:13:28.725 --> 00:13:31.311 position:50% align:center
A moment?

00:13:31.394 --> 00:13:35.523 position:50% align:center
Look at this. From the
Imperial Armed Forces.

00:13:39.277 --> 00:13:40.487 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA]
Hmm.

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:43.156 position:50% align:center
Investigating facilities
in the Nether.

00:13:43.239 --> 00:13:45.742 position:50% align:center
Does it mean the military's
planning to go down there?

00:13:45.825 --> 00:13:47.744 position:50% align:center
Specifically,
it's Company 2 going,

00:13:47.827 --> 00:13:49.913 position:50% align:center
but we're gonna be joining them.

00:13:49.996 --> 00:13:52.457 position:50% align:center
They've requested our
assistance on the mission.

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:54.959 position:50% align:center
I'd imagine it's because
of our previous experience

00:13:55.043 --> 00:13:56.044 position:50% align:center
in the Nether.

00:13:56.127 --> 00:13:57.170 position:50% align:center
No doubt.

00:13:57.253 --> 00:13:58.672 position:50% align:center
But what I wanted
to discuss with you

00:13:58.755 --> 00:14:01.424 position:50% align:center
is what's mentioned at
the end of the letter.

00:14:01.508 --> 00:14:03.051 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:03.134 --> 00:14:06.388 position:50% align:center
Company 8's under the
Fire Defense Agency,

00:14:06.471 --> 00:14:09.891 position:50% align:center
so we can refuse a request
from the military.

00:14:11.601 --> 00:14:14.646 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Hinawa, what should we do?

00:14:17.482 --> 00:14:19.067 position:50% align:center
[MAKI]
Yes, sir?

00:14:23.029 --> 00:14:26.866 position:50% align:center
Huh. From the Armed Forces.

00:14:28.993 --> 00:14:31.663 position:50% align:center
Wait. Hold on, sir. Is this a--?

00:14:31.746 --> 00:14:33.915 position:50% align:center
It's an order for you to
return to the military.

00:14:33.998 --> 00:14:36.543 position:50% align:center
But I'm not with them anymore.
I'm a Fire Soldier!

00:14:36.626 --> 00:14:38.378 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's true.

00:14:38.461 --> 00:14:40.922 position:50% align:center
But look, this request
is coming straight

00:14:41.006 --> 00:14:42.882 position:50% align:center
from your father, General Oze.

00:14:42.966 --> 00:14:44.759 position:50% align:center
And so what if it did?

00:14:44.843 --> 00:14:47.137 position:50% align:center
I mean, obviously, I'm not
just gonna leave the 8th.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.014 position:50% align:center
I hear your brother in the CID

00:14:49.097 --> 00:14:51.349 position:50% align:center
was badly hurt
investigating the Nether.

00:14:51.433 --> 00:14:53.476 position:50% align:center
[MAKI] He was, but
nothing life-threatening!

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.061 position:50% align:center
Every day the
White-Clad's tactics

00:14:55.145 --> 00:14:57.397 position:50% align:center
are becoming more
and more extreme.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:58.857 position:50% align:center
Your father's probably
just worried

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:01.151 position:50% align:center
about you getting hurt, too.

00:15:01.234 --> 00:15:04.904 position:50% align:center
[MAKI] I'm sure he is,
but I can handle myself.

00:15:04.988 --> 00:15:07.991 position:50% align:center
It's simple. The lieutenant
recruited me for the 8th.

00:15:08.074 --> 00:15:10.994 position:50% align:center
And I am a proud
member of this company.

00:15:11.077 --> 00:15:12.912 position:50% align:center
Right, Lieutenant?

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:19.836 position:50% align:center
Maki, please go back.

00:15:21.171 --> 00:15:22.839 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:15:25.967 --> 00:15:29.471 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT] So we've got a
joint mission with the 8th, huh?

00:15:29.554 --> 00:15:31.890 position:50% align:center
I hear it's a large-scale
investigation of the Nether.

00:15:31.973 --> 00:15:33.391 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:15:33.475 --> 00:15:36.519 position:50% align:center
Focused on uncovering the
White-Clad's testing facilities.

00:15:36.603 --> 00:15:38.688 position:50% align:center
I hope Tamaki's coming, too.

00:15:38.772 --> 00:15:39.564 position:50% align:center
[HAJIKI]
Hm?

00:15:39.647 --> 00:15:41.608 position:50% align:center
Oh, uh, it's nothing, really!

00:15:42.484 --> 00:15:45.487 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
Come on, you stupid lid!

00:15:46.488 --> 00:15:48.490 position:50% align:center
Morning, everyone.

00:15:48.573 --> 00:15:49.949 position:50% align:center
What are you doing?

00:15:50.033 --> 00:15:53.286 position:50% align:center
Trying to get a pickle.
This lid is so tight.

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:55.163 position:50% align:center
I used to always get
Maki to help me out

00:15:55.246 --> 00:15:57.415 position:50% align:center
with stuff like this.

00:15:57.499 --> 00:16:01.044 position:50% align:center
Did she really have to go
back the day the order came?

00:16:05.674 --> 00:16:08.885 position:50% align:center
[OBI] Maki's the daughter of an
Imperial Armed Forces general.

00:16:08.968 --> 00:16:10.178 position:50% align:center
I'll bet he's trying
to make sure

00:16:10.261 --> 00:16:13.098 position:50% align:center
that she doesn't join
the mission in the--

00:16:13.181 --> 00:16:14.641 position:50% align:center
Whoops, my bad.

00:16:14.724 --> 00:16:20.230 position:50% align:center
That's exactly why I always
asked Maki to do it. Not you.

00:16:20.313 --> 00:16:23.400 position:50% align:center
So, Maki, when's
she coming back?

00:16:26.027 --> 00:16:28.405 position:50% align:center
Never. It's not gonna happen.

00:16:28.488 --> 00:16:29.656 position:50% align:center
--Liar.
--Hey, man!

00:16:29.739 --> 00:16:30.740 position:50% align:center
She made the decision herself!

00:16:30.824 --> 00:16:32.158 position:50% align:center
Can't hear you!

00:16:32.242 --> 00:16:33.827 position:50% align:center
Maki chose to go back, okay?

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:35.745 position:50% align:center
La-la-la-la-la!

00:16:35.829 --> 00:16:38.957 position:50% align:center
What's your deal?
Are you a child?

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.417 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI sighs]

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:44.754 position:50% align:center
Yeah, this sucks. But it's
true. She left the 8th.

00:16:50.176 --> 00:16:52.095 position:50% align:center
[MAKI]
Eleven already.

00:16:52.178 --> 00:16:56.725 position:50% align:center
Usually, we'd finish our office
work and start daily training.

00:17:05.442 --> 00:17:08.528 position:50% align:center
Go back to the military?

00:17:11.823 --> 00:17:15.035 position:50% align:center
The White-Clad are more
dangerous than ever before.

00:17:15.118 --> 00:17:18.371 position:50% align:center
This isn't a mission for
"Daddy's precious girl."

00:17:26.171 --> 00:17:28.214 position:50% align:center
Understood.

00:17:29.632 --> 00:17:32.093 position:50% align:center
[MAKI] The lieutenant
thinks I'm not up to this.

00:17:32.177 --> 00:17:34.387 position:50% align:center
That I'm still too green.

00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:40.643 position:50% align:center
[HIRAOKA] Secretary Oze.
I'm Captain Hiraoka!

00:17:40.727 --> 00:17:41.895 position:50% align:center
Thanks for all your hard work!

00:17:41.978 --> 00:17:44.773 position:50% align:center
Oh, good morning,
Captain Hiraoka.

00:17:44.856 --> 00:17:46.733 position:50% align:center
[MAKI chuckles]

00:17:46.816 --> 00:17:48.860 position:50% align:center
[MAKI] They're all
so careful around me.

00:17:48.943 --> 00:17:50.904 position:50% align:center
Is that Oze's daughter?

00:17:50.987 --> 00:17:53.740 position:50% align:center
Yeah, such a cutie.

00:17:53.823 --> 00:17:59.120 position:50% align:center
That old cuss...
made something beautiful.

00:17:59.204 --> 00:18:00.705 position:50% align:center
[SECRETARY A]
Hello there.

00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:02.415 position:50% align:center
[MAKI]
Did you have the morning off?

00:18:02.499 --> 00:18:05.126 position:50% align:center
Well, there wasn't
much for me to do.

00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:07.754 position:50% align:center
This job is actually
pretty cushy, huh?

00:18:07.837 --> 00:18:10.298 position:50% align:center
We're surrounded by these
cute elite soldiers.

00:18:10.382 --> 00:18:11.883 position:50% align:center
It pays really well.

00:18:11.966 --> 00:18:14.344 position:50% align:center
This is peak princess's
privilege, ya know?

00:18:14.427 --> 00:18:16.888 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I suppose it is, huh?

00:18:16.971 --> 00:18:18.348 position:50% align:center
You and I both spent our lives

00:18:18.431 --> 00:18:20.225 position:50% align:center
being coddled by
everyone around us,

00:18:20.308 --> 00:18:23.395 position:50% align:center
always being told how
adorable and sweet we are.

00:18:23.478 --> 00:18:25.230 position:50% align:center
We had a ton of positive
reinforcement

00:18:25.313 --> 00:18:26.523 position:50% align:center
when we were young,

00:18:26.606 --> 00:18:29.025 position:50% align:center
so we grew up to be nicer
than a lot of folks.

00:18:29.109 --> 00:18:30.860 position:50% align:center
And on top of all that,
we're smart.

00:18:30.944 --> 00:18:34.447 position:50% align:center
Making us the perfect people
to put in the elite's showcase.

00:18:34.531 --> 00:18:38.618 position:50% align:center
Welcome to the stereotype--
we really type here.

00:18:48.086 --> 00:18:50.130 position:50% align:center
Go back, Maki.

00:18:52.132 --> 00:18:54.759 position:50% align:center
What is that?
Company 8's insignia?

00:18:54.843 --> 00:18:56.302 position:50% align:center
Oh. Yeah, it is.

00:18:56.386 --> 00:19:00.974 position:50% align:center
It was a gift. A going-away
present from them.

00:19:07.856 --> 00:19:09.899 position:50% align:center
[DANRO]
Good morning, Maki sweetie.

00:19:09.983 --> 00:19:11.234 position:50% align:center
[SECRETARY A]
Huh?

00:19:11.317 --> 00:19:14.487 position:50% align:center
Wait, did I hear that right?
He called her what?

00:19:14.571 --> 00:19:17.449 position:50% align:center
The fearsome General Oze,
Nio Guardian of the Empire,

00:19:17.532 --> 00:19:19.409 position:50% align:center
still baby-talks his
grown-up daughter?

00:19:19.492 --> 00:19:20.660 position:50% align:center
[grumbles]

00:19:20.744 --> 00:19:22.871 position:50% align:center
Uh! I think I'll step
out for a moment, sir!

00:19:22.954 --> 00:19:24.539 position:50% align:center
[DANRO]
Thank you.

00:19:27.083 --> 00:19:29.794 position:50% align:center
I hope you know how
happy I am you're here.

00:19:29.878 --> 00:19:33.340 position:50% align:center
All I did was come back
to my rightful place.

00:19:34.341 --> 00:19:37.844 position:50% align:center
Your little bird is
back in her cage.

00:19:37.927 --> 00:19:41.097 position:50% align:center
[DANRO] Now, honey,
I know you're upset with me.

00:19:41.181 --> 00:19:43.975 position:50% align:center
When you left, the deal was
that you'd be protecting people.

00:19:44.059 --> 00:19:45.769 position:50% align:center
This dangerous battle
with the White-Clad

00:19:45.852 --> 00:19:48.646 position:50% align:center
wasn't part of our agreement.

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:50.899 position:50% align:center
You've never been the kind
of person to be deceptive

00:19:50.982 --> 00:19:53.318 position:50% align:center
or go back on your word.

00:19:56.613 --> 00:20:00.742 position:50% align:center
So I assume you must've been
tricked by Lieutenant Hinawa.

00:20:00.825 --> 00:20:02.243 position:50% align:center
Hm.

00:20:02.327 --> 00:20:05.538 position:50% align:center
Whatever the case, I'm still
very happy that you're back.

00:20:05.622 --> 00:20:07.832 position:50% align:center
We'll talk more
about this later.

00:20:17.717 --> 00:20:19.761 position:50% align:center
[MAKI]
This isn't Dad's fault.

00:20:19.844 --> 00:20:22.138 position:50% align:center
He's only worried about me.

00:20:22.222 --> 00:20:24.808 position:50% align:center
It's the same for
Lieutenant Hinawa.

00:20:24.891 --> 00:20:29.396 position:50% align:center
I'm just not up to the task
at hand. Not good enough.

00:20:29.479 --> 00:20:31.314 position:50% align:center
It's on me.

00:20:32.315 --> 00:20:34.984 position:50% align:center
I was doing my best, too...

00:20:35.068 --> 00:20:38.279 position:50% align:center
But they're both
so tough to please.

00:20:38.363 --> 00:20:39.656 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't have
to work so hard

00:20:39.739 --> 00:20:41.157 position:50% align:center
to get through your training.

00:20:41.241 --> 00:20:43.868 position:50% align:center
It needs to be easier for you.

00:20:43.952 --> 00:20:47.205 position:50% align:center
Yep, so demanding.

00:20:48.164 --> 00:20:51.418 position:50% align:center
Or maybe I'm pushing
myself too much.

00:20:53.169 --> 00:20:55.714 position:50% align:center
[SECRETARY A] Even caged
birds like us have problems.

00:20:55.797 --> 00:20:58.216 position:50% align:center
Other people don't understand.

00:21:03.596 --> 00:21:06.307 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasping]

00:21:07.892 --> 00:21:10.770 position:50% align:center
[HONDA] Just doing a little
head and neck training.

00:21:10.854 --> 00:21:13.273 position:50% align:center
Don't mind me--please begin.

00:21:13.356 --> 00:21:14.858 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:21:14.941 --> 00:21:17.152 position:50% align:center
There are a few things for us
to consider on this mission--

00:21:19.487 --> 00:21:22.240 position:50% align:center
Yes? Please go on.

00:21:23.658 --> 00:21:26.578 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] There are a plethora of
facilities in Tokyo's Nether,

00:21:26.661 --> 00:21:29.080 position:50% align:center
but during the Great Cataclysm,
most of them were buried

00:21:29.164 --> 00:21:32.876 position:50% align:center
and can't be reached unless
you tunnel through the rubble.

00:21:32.959 --> 00:21:35.879 position:50% align:center
As such, we're trying to find
a location that can be reached

00:21:35.962 --> 00:21:38.298 position:50% align:center
without any excavation.

00:21:38.381 --> 00:21:40.300 position:50% align:center
So that considerably
narrows down the points

00:21:40.383 --> 00:21:42.177 position:50% align:center
we need to search.

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:44.512 position:50% align:center
Thanks to Lieutenant
Oze of the CID,

00:21:44.596 --> 00:21:46.056 position:50% align:center
we have a good idea
where to look.

00:21:46.139 --> 00:21:47.724 position:50% align:center
[HONDA]
Mh-hm.

00:21:47.807 --> 00:21:49.476 position:50% align:center
If we investigate
them one by one,

00:21:49.559 --> 00:21:52.228 position:50% align:center
there's a fair chance that
we'll tip off the enemy.

00:21:52.312 --> 00:21:53.646 position:50% align:center
Therefore, the best
plan would be

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:56.149 position:50% align:center
to begin searching
them all at once.

00:21:56.232 --> 00:21:59.903 position:50% align:center
You're suggesting we deploy
multiple units at the same time?

00:21:59.986 --> 00:22:01.780 position:50% align:center
Lieutenant Ayabe here.

00:22:01.863 --> 00:22:04.741 position:50% align:center
Since the 8th does have some
experience in the Nether,

00:22:04.824 --> 00:22:07.577 position:50% align:center
perhaps you should split up
and have a member in each unit.

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:08.453 position:50% align:center
All right.

00:22:08.536 --> 00:22:09.579 position:50% align:center
We just need to have every group

00:22:09.662 --> 00:22:13.041 position:50% align:center
investigate these spots
simultaneously.

00:22:13.124 --> 00:22:14.793 position:50% align:center
[HONDA yells]

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:18.546 position:50% align:center
Attention, Fire Force Company 2!

00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:21.508 position:50% align:center
This is an order to
all our crewmen.

00:22:21.591 --> 00:22:26.721 position:50% align:center
Tomorrow at 0800, we begin
Operation Nether Investigation.

00:22:28.431 --> 00:22:30.308 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
So we from the 8th,

00:22:30.392 --> 00:22:33.478 position:50% align:center
we'll mobilize separately
with groups from the 2nd?

00:22:33.561 --> 00:22:34.562 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Mh-hm.

00:22:34.646 --> 00:22:37.273 position:50% align:center
It's our first mission
without Maki.

00:22:37.357 --> 00:22:39.109 position:50% align:center
Let's stay sharp and focused!

00:22:39.192 --> 00:22:40.777 position:50% align:center
[8TH]
Yes, sir!

00:24:17.749 --> 00:24:20.502 position:50% align:center
Both of you, stay behind me!

00:24:20.585 --> 00:24:22.212 position:50% align:center
[IRIS]
