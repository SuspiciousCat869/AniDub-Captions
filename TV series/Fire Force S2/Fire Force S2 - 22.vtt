[GIOVANNI groans]

00:00:35.744 --> 00:00:37.412 position:50% align:center
Violet Flash!

00:00:41.624 --> 00:00:42.500 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:00:42.584 --> 00:00:44.377 position:50% align:center
How did he avoid that?

00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:46.296 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
It certainly wasn't easy.

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.632 position:50% align:center
I doubt I could've managed it
without reading your pheromones.

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:51.426 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
You're so gross!

00:00:53.511 --> 00:00:56.056 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
Bombardier Beetle.

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:00.852 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
What's your problem?

00:01:00.935 --> 00:01:02.354 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
It's hot. Shinra, it's hot!

00:01:02.437 --> 00:01:03.980 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] I am not gonna
die with you, idiot!

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:07.776 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] Superheated gas.
There's no escaping it.

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:09.069 position:50% align:center
What are you White-Clad goons

00:01:09.152 --> 00:01:11.988 position:50% align:center
sneaking around in
the Nether for anyway?

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:14.115 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] We be won't
be here much longer.

00:01:14.199 --> 00:01:17.160 position:50% align:center
Our preparations are
all-but complete.

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:18.578 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
What?

00:01:18.661 --> 00:01:21.956 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] The destruction
of this world is at hand.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.125 position:50% align:center
The Pillars will be assembled,

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:27.128 position:50% align:center
and the Evangelist's
plan enacted.

00:01:27.212 --> 00:01:29.881 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] We know that plan,
and we're gonna stop it!

00:01:29.964 --> 00:01:31.383 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
Have your investigations

00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:32.926 position:50% align:center
taught you nothing?

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:35.845 position:50% align:center
The Tokyo Empire itself
was built in accordance

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:38.348 position:50% align:center
with the Evangelist's design.

00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:41.559 position:50% align:center
The Holy Sol Temple, Amaterasu--

00:01:41.643 --> 00:01:44.479 position:50% align:center
all were built with
this moment in mind.

00:01:44.562 --> 00:01:46.940 position:50% align:center
And it's become quite clear
that humanity itself

00:01:47.023 --> 00:01:49.109 position:50% align:center
yearns for annihilation.

00:01:49.192 --> 00:01:52.278 position:50% align:center
There's no stopping her plan.

00:01:52.362 --> 00:01:54.698 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] You're saying
humanity wants to die out?

00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:56.574 position:50% align:center
Well, tell that to
the people I've saved.

00:01:56.658 --> 00:01:59.577 position:50% align:center
They seemed pretty friggin'
glad to be alive to me.

00:01:59.661 --> 00:02:02.122 position:50% align:center
You don't get to
decide what they want!

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.542 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
Through destruction,

00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:09.045 position:50% align:center
mankind has a chance
to reach a higher plane.

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:12.007 position:50% align:center
Would you rob us of that chance?

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.806 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] Oh, well. You'll
be made to understand soon.

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:23.143 position:50% align:center
Just as your dear brother was.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.022 position:50% align:center
What did you do to Sho?

00:02:27.105 --> 00:02:29.107 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
He's been neutralized.

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.360 position:50% align:center
He now sits as still as a doll.

00:02:32.444 --> 00:02:38.408 position:50% align:center
[HAUMEA singing]

00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:42.287 position:50% align:center
Heh. I always wanted to
have a doll of my own.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.165 position:50% align:center
This one sure is pretty,
don't'cha think?

00:02:48.126 --> 00:02:50.295 position:50% align:center
You don't get to
look away from this.

00:02:50.378 --> 00:02:51.671 position:50% align:center
You're going to stand right here

00:02:51.755 --> 00:02:54.382 position:50% align:center
with your mouth shut
and watch us.

00:02:55.508 --> 00:03:00.055 position:50% align:center
Yeah. You're gonna see just
how much fun we can have.

00:04:41.364 --> 00:04:45.618 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Tell me--where
are you keeping Sho?

00:04:45.702 --> 00:04:48.204 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] That Pillar is
waiting in his proper place

00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:51.916 position:50% align:center
for the coming of the
new Great Cataclysm.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.712 position:50% align:center
Your brother is a
well-behaved, obedient boy.

00:04:55.795 --> 00:05:00.300 position:50% align:center
Unlike you. I imagine Haumea
has claimed him as her toy.

00:05:00.383 --> 00:05:02.802 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI laughs]

00:05:04.429 --> 00:05:05.889 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
So what if you can read my mind?

00:05:05.972 --> 00:05:08.641 position:50% align:center
I can still move faster
than you can react!

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:14.481 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] I don't see
anyone. Did he leave?

00:05:14.564 --> 00:05:16.483 position:50% align:center
No. I'm right here.

00:05:16.566 --> 00:05:20.445 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI yells]

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.785 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
Such tremendous acceleration.

00:05:36.211 --> 00:05:39.339 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] I take it you
don't plan to come quietly.

00:05:39.422 --> 00:05:40.632 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
I sensed your bloodthirst

00:05:40.715 --> 00:05:42.926 position:50% align:center
back at Vulcan's workshop.

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:44.594 position:50% align:center
There's no way I would
ever trust someone

00:05:44.678 --> 00:05:46.179 position:50% align:center
with a heart as
sinister as yours!

00:05:46.262 --> 00:05:49.766 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] What was that?
You "sensed" my bloodthirst?

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:52.435 position:50% align:center
Then you and I were connected--
through an Adolla Link.

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:55.522 position:50% align:center
Are you sure?
Did you hear my voice?

00:05:55.605 --> 00:05:57.232 position:50% align:center
Yeah. What's it matter if I did?

00:05:57.315 --> 00:05:59.484 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI laughs]

00:05:59.567 --> 00:06:01.653 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] Incredible.
This is marvelous news!

00:06:01.736 --> 00:06:03.530 position:50% align:center
Thank you! Thank you!

00:06:03.613 --> 00:06:05.281 position:50% align:center
You're saying that
a mere human like me

00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:07.659 position:50% align:center
was able to connect
to you through Adolla!

00:06:07.742 --> 00:06:09.744 position:50% align:center
But only those with
a connection to Adolla

00:06:09.828 --> 00:06:11.871 position:50% align:center
can undergo an Adolla Link!

00:06:11.955 --> 00:06:14.249 position:50% align:center
My insect experiments
have borne fruit!

00:06:14.332 --> 00:06:17.377 position:50% align:center
Through my labors I've
come closer to Adolla!

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.505 position:50% align:center
Hold on, so for me to
connect to someone like that,

00:06:20.588 --> 00:06:21.798 position:50% align:center
they have to be tied to Adolla?

00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:23.842 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
It stands to reason, yes!

00:06:23.925 --> 00:06:26.094 position:50% align:center
Adolla Links can only
be achieved by those

00:06:26.177 --> 00:06:27.637 position:50% align:center
who have Adolla Bursts,

00:06:27.721 --> 00:06:31.224 position:50% align:center
or by those who have somehow
come into contact with Adolla.

00:06:31.307 --> 00:06:34.102 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI laughs]

00:06:34.185 --> 00:06:36.479 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] But...
I've heard people's voices

00:06:36.563 --> 00:06:38.440 position:50% align:center
through Adolla Links
twice before.

00:06:38.523 --> 00:06:41.151 position:50% align:center
First with Dr. Giovanni.

00:06:41.234 --> 00:06:43.278 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
Vulcan must be killed.

00:06:43.361 --> 00:06:45.030 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
And one other time...

00:06:45.113 --> 00:06:49.200 position:50% align:center
Protect him, Shinra!

00:06:49.284 --> 00:06:51.453 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
...with Lieutenant Konro.

00:06:51.536 --> 00:06:54.247 position:50% align:center
Since I was able to form
an Adolla Link with him,

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.875 position:50% align:center
does that mean he's been
close to Adolla, too?

00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.460 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
Something troubling you?

00:06:58.543 --> 00:07:00.337 position:50% align:center
Shut up!

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.714 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] The Evangelist
resides not in this world,

00:07:02.797 --> 00:07:04.799 position:50% align:center
but in Adolla.

00:07:04.883 --> 00:07:06.843 position:50% align:center
And since she is
not of this world,

00:07:06.926 --> 00:07:09.554 position:50% align:center
I daresay you lack the
means to fight her.

00:07:09.637 --> 00:07:12.390 position:50% align:center
Your power lets you peer
into the higher plane,

00:07:12.474 --> 00:07:15.185 position:50% align:center
but that's as far
as it will get you.

00:07:15.268 --> 00:07:18.438 position:50% align:center
Are you saying it's impossible
for us to go to Adolla?

00:07:18.521 --> 00:07:20.065 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
Tell me, Fire Soldier.

00:07:20.148 --> 00:07:21.983 position:50% align:center
How do you intend
to put out the flames

00:07:22.067 --> 00:07:24.319 position:50% align:center
when you can't reach the scene?

00:07:24.402 --> 00:07:27.697 position:50% align:center
The earth will burn,
there's no stopping it.

00:07:27.781 --> 00:07:30.325 position:50% align:center
We humans are but fuel
to feed the fire

00:07:30.408 --> 00:07:32.285 position:50% align:center
that will consume this world.

00:07:32.369 --> 00:07:34.621 position:50% align:center
Humanity worships
the sun above all.

00:07:34.704 --> 00:07:39.125 position:50% align:center
We'd never refuse the chance to
burn brightly in its likeness.

00:07:39.209 --> 00:07:41.920 position:50% align:center
But it was the Evangelist
who created our religion, right?

00:07:42.003 --> 00:07:45.131 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] Ritsu will be
ready any moment now.

00:07:45.215 --> 00:07:47.634 position:50% align:center
Allow us to give you
a demonstration.

00:07:47.717 --> 00:07:52.138 position:50% align:center
Proof that humans are
implements of destruction.

00:07:52.222 --> 00:07:54.808 position:50% align:center
We will utilize the
labyrinthian Nether

00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:59.062 position:50% align:center
to utterly demolish
the Tokyo Empire.

00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:02.107 position:50% align:center
A large-scale demolition?
Are you sure?

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:04.317 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Pretty sure.

00:08:04.401 --> 00:08:06.277 position:50% align:center
The White-Clad wanna
form a shaped charge

00:08:06.361 --> 00:08:08.196 position:50% align:center
using all these Infernals.

00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:09.698 position:50% align:center
A shaped charge?

00:08:09.781 --> 00:08:12.534 position:50% align:center
Yeah, from what Vulcan's
sensors were able to pick up,

00:08:12.617 --> 00:08:13.868 position:50% align:center
it looks like the Infernals

00:08:13.952 --> 00:08:17.455 position:50% align:center
are positioned in a conical
formation, like so.

00:08:17.539 --> 00:08:20.000 position:50% align:center
[HONDA] Is there some
significance to this formation?

00:08:20.083 --> 00:08:22.460 position:50% align:center
It's commonly used for
controlled demolition.

00:08:22.544 --> 00:08:25.463 position:50% align:center
Demo teams employ what's known
as the Munroe-Neumann Effect

00:08:25.547 --> 00:08:28.967 position:50% align:center
using cone-shaped explosives to
get more bang for their booms.

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:31.761 position:50% align:center
Basically, you shape your
explosive like a reverse cone

00:08:31.845 --> 00:08:33.888 position:50% align:center
and line it with a
thin layer of metal.

00:08:33.972 --> 00:08:36.266 position:50% align:center
Then, when you detonate
near the point of the cone,

00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:37.434 position:50% align:center
you create a weak spot

00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:39.936 position:50% align:center
for all of the explosion's
force to escape.

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:41.438 position:50% align:center
This funnels the entire blast

00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:43.940 position:50% align:center
into a metal-tipped jet
of destructive energy,

00:08:44.024 --> 00:08:47.110 position:50% align:center
punching a hole through
anything in its path.

00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:48.987 position:50% align:center
They're using countless
Infernals to do this

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:50.488 position:50% align:center
on a massive scale.

00:08:50.572 --> 00:08:52.449 position:50% align:center
Maximizing the output
of what's already

00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:54.701 position:50% align:center
a large amount of firepower.

00:08:54.784 --> 00:08:57.454 position:50% align:center
And unfortunately, we're
right beneath the center

00:08:57.537 --> 00:08:59.164 position:50% align:center
of the Tokyo Empire.

00:08:59.247 --> 00:09:01.833 position:50% align:center
The damage will be tremendous.

00:09:01.916 --> 00:09:03.251 position:50% align:center
All right.

00:09:03.335 --> 00:09:06.588 position:50% align:center
What level of catastrophe
are we talking about here?

00:09:06.671 --> 00:09:09.507 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] The whole Empire
could be wiped out.

00:09:10.967 --> 00:09:12.344 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:09:12.427 --> 00:09:15.138 position:50% align:center
So what can we do to prevent it?

00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:17.307 position:50% align:center
I heard everything as I came in.

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:18.892 position:50% align:center
I apologize for our tardiness--

00:09:18.975 --> 00:09:21.019 position:50% align:center
a certain someone
was dragging his feet.

00:09:21.102 --> 00:09:22.562 position:50% align:center
[HONDA]
Detective Oze.

00:09:22.645 --> 00:09:25.273 position:50% align:center
I've more or less memorized
the layout of the whole Nether.

00:09:25.357 --> 00:09:27.359 position:50% align:center
Is there anything
that I can do to help?

00:09:27.442 --> 00:09:30.820 position:50% align:center
All the power of a shaped charge
is pushed into the main jet.

00:09:30.904 --> 00:09:34.157 position:50% align:center
We need to disrupt that jet's
formation or change its path.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.742 position:50% align:center
But to do that,
we'll need a second gen

00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:38.661 position:50% align:center
who can control a whole
lotta flame at once.

00:09:38.745 --> 00:09:40.163 position:50% align:center
[TAKIGI grumbles]

is best suited for
pinpoint precision.

00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.919 position:50% align:center
I don't think this
is a job for him.

00:09:46.002 --> 00:09:48.380 position:50% align:center
[TAKIGI]
Of course you'd be useless.

00:09:48.463 --> 00:09:50.131 position:50% align:center
Wait. This is serious!

00:09:50.215 --> 00:09:52.425 position:50% align:center
We don't have time to stand
around chattin', guys!

00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:53.635 position:50% align:center
They're gonna blow soon!

00:09:53.718 --> 00:09:55.095 position:50% align:center
Come on! Are there no other

00:09:55.178 --> 00:09:57.764 position:50% align:center
second-generation
pyrokinetics down here?

00:09:57.847 --> 00:10:00.725 position:50% align:center
None who can handle flame
on this large a scale at least.

00:10:00.809 --> 00:10:03.019 position:50% align:center
There's no denying that
this is quite the challenge,

00:10:03.103 --> 00:10:06.356 position:50% align:center
but... there is someone who can.

00:10:06.439 --> 00:10:08.983 position:50% align:center
First Class Fire Soldier
Maki Oze-- Ooh...

00:10:09.067 --> 00:10:11.069 position:50% align:center
Make that Secretary Oze.

00:10:11.152 --> 00:10:13.822 position:50% align:center
Who I recall you taking
away from us, Detec--

00:10:13.905 --> 00:10:16.574 position:50% align:center
I see no point in bringing up
people who aren't even around!

00:10:16.658 --> 00:10:19.285 position:50% align:center
We'll just have to make do with
the second gens we have here!

00:10:19.369 --> 00:10:21.371 position:50% align:center
Lieutenant Hinawa,
you ready for this?

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:23.415 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA]
No. Busy being useless.

00:10:23.498 --> 00:10:27.002 position:50% align:center
Urgh! I guess the 8th is just
a gang of brutes after all.

00:10:27.085 --> 00:10:28.795 position:50% align:center
So much for all that
self-righteous blather

00:10:28.878 --> 00:10:30.296 position:50% align:center
about putting lives first!

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:34.801 position:50% align:center
We do put lives first.
We will find a way to stop this.

00:10:34.884 --> 00:10:39.305 position:50% align:center
Because letting the people of
Tokyo die is not an option.

00:10:39.389 --> 00:10:40.098 position:50% align:center
Vulcan!

00:10:40.181 --> 00:10:41.850 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
It's done, sir.

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:45.437 position:50% align:center
We don't care about protocol.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:49.482 position:50% align:center
Not when there are lives
on the line. Right...

00:10:49.566 --> 00:10:50.567 position:50% align:center
...Maki?

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:51.735 position:50% align:center
--[TAKIGI] Maki?
--[TAMAKI] Maki!

00:10:51.818 --> 00:10:53.987 position:50% align:center
Um, sorry I'm late, guys.

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:55.864 position:50% align:center
I'm fully caught up
on the situation,

00:10:55.947 --> 00:10:57.532 position:50% align:center
thanks to this communicator.

00:10:57.615 --> 00:10:59.951 position:50% align:center
There are no secrets
between members of the 8th.

00:11:00.035 --> 00:11:01.536 position:50% align:center
You sure about this?

00:11:01.619 --> 00:11:03.455 position:50% align:center
--Yes, sir.
--What are you doing here, Maki?

00:11:03.538 --> 00:11:04.831 position:50% align:center
It's too dangerous!

00:11:04.914 --> 00:11:06.541 position:50% align:center
I don't need
protecting right now.

00:11:06.624 --> 00:11:08.209 position:50% align:center
But the civilians above do.

00:11:08.293 --> 00:11:10.712 position:50% align:center
You can help people without
putting your own life at risk!

00:11:10.795 --> 00:11:11.963 position:50% align:center
Don't be dense--

00:11:12.047 --> 00:11:13.298 position:50% align:center
I'm not taking any more
of a risk than you are!

00:11:13.381 --> 00:11:15.842 position:50% align:center
But I'm not a girl!

00:11:15.925 --> 00:11:18.053 position:50% align:center
I don't think the flames
care what gender I am.

00:11:18.136 --> 00:11:21.431 position:50% align:center
You might've forced Mom off the
frontlines, but I'm different.

00:11:21.514 --> 00:11:25.143 position:50% align:center
Shut up and watch. I have
the power to save lives.

00:11:25.226 --> 00:11:26.978 position:50% align:center
I'll wait for your
signal, Vulcan.

00:11:27.062 --> 00:11:29.105 position:50% align:center
No problem.
It won't be long now.

00:11:29.189 --> 00:11:30.482 position:50% align:center
I'll tell you when
to brace for it.

00:11:30.565 --> 00:11:34.194 position:50% align:center
Wait. You still have time.
Please get outta here.

00:11:34.277 --> 00:11:35.236 position:50% align:center
Maki!

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.113 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Hey! Hold up!

00:11:37.197 --> 00:11:38.448 position:50% align:center
With Maki's help,

00:11:38.531 --> 00:11:40.492 position:50% align:center
we can stop the shaped
charge from blasting Tokyo,

00:11:40.575 --> 00:11:44.746 position:50% align:center
but that leaves us a bunch of
fire that has nowhere to go.

00:11:44.829 --> 00:11:45.789 position:50% align:center
Those flames are gonna

00:11:45.872 --> 00:11:48.291 position:50% align:center
completely tear
through the Nether.

00:11:48.375 --> 00:11:49.542 position:50% align:center
Meaning?

00:11:49.626 --> 00:11:52.212 position:50% align:center
Well, for those of us
who aren't fireproof,

00:11:52.295 --> 00:11:55.465 position:50% align:center
it means we're about to be
roasted where we stand.

00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:57.092 position:50% align:center
We're screwed!

00:12:05.016 --> 00:12:06.810 position:50% align:center
[OBI] What the hell
are you saying, Licht?

00:12:06.893 --> 00:12:08.561 position:50% align:center
Are we all dead no matter what?

00:12:08.645 --> 00:12:10.105 position:50% align:center
So if Maki does her thing,

00:12:10.188 --> 00:12:11.481 position:50% align:center
these tunnels
and the city above us

00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:13.483 position:50% align:center
should all come out
of it unscathed.

00:12:13.566 --> 00:12:14.859 position:50% align:center
But that isn't to say
she's gonna make

00:12:14.943 --> 00:12:16.820 position:50% align:center
all that fire go away!

00:12:16.903 --> 00:12:19.072 position:50% align:center
And since the flames won't be
funneled out to the surface,

00:12:19.155 --> 00:12:21.199 position:50% align:center
they're gonna fill these small,
cramped tunnels instead

00:12:21.282 --> 00:12:23.702 position:50% align:center
and burn everyone inside them
into blackened crisps.

00:12:23.785 --> 00:12:26.913 position:50% align:center
Except... Except Tamaki.
She's super heat tolerant.

00:12:26.996 --> 00:12:28.498 position:50% align:center
Are you serious?

00:12:28.581 --> 00:12:30.709 position:50% align:center
Sol, save us.

00:12:30.792 --> 00:12:33.503 position:50% align:center
[2ND CREWMAN A]
So, what do we do?

00:12:33.586 --> 00:12:35.088 position:50% align:center
We stay till the job's done.

00:12:35.171 --> 00:12:37.215 position:50% align:center
We're prepared to do whatever
it takes to save lives,

00:12:37.298 --> 00:12:40.427 position:50% align:center
that's why we wear
the blue stripes.

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:41.845 position:50% align:center
Vulcan, time yet?

00:12:41.928 --> 00:12:44.472 position:50% align:center
[VULCAN]
It'll be real soon.

00:12:44.556 --> 00:12:46.808 position:50% align:center
Well, Captain?
You okay with this?

00:12:46.891 --> 00:12:48.309 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:12:48.393 --> 00:12:52.063 position:50% align:center
But trust me when I say that
we'll find a way to survive.

00:12:52.147 --> 00:12:55.483 position:50% align:center
Yeah, heroics are great,
but I don't wanna die, so, um...

00:12:55.567 --> 00:12:57.694 position:50% align:center
Ideally, we'd just look
for a spot in the Nether

00:12:57.777 --> 00:12:59.821 position:50% align:center
to dump all that heat.

00:12:59.904 --> 00:13:03.116 position:50% align:center
Too bad it's a ruinous maze
that defies rhyme and reason.

00:13:03.199 --> 00:13:04.617 position:50% align:center
During my investigation,

00:13:04.701 --> 00:13:07.328 position:50% align:center
I memorized every map of
the Nether I could find.

00:13:07.412 --> 00:13:09.456 position:50% align:center
If we can breach
the caved in parts,

00:13:09.539 --> 00:13:12.167 position:50% align:center
there might be room to keep
the flames away from us.

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:15.003 position:50% align:center
Well, if you know your way
around as well as you say...

00:13:15.086 --> 00:13:19.549 position:50% align:center
We can use geothermic
dissipation. Create a heat sink.

00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:20.800 position:50% align:center
Get ready, guys.

00:13:20.884 --> 00:13:22.385 position:50% align:center
Okay, there's no time to
explain how this works,

00:13:22.469 --> 00:13:24.179 position:50% align:center
so just do as I say!

00:13:28.099 --> 00:13:29.184 position:50% align:center
You're helping me?

00:13:29.267 --> 00:13:31.436 position:50% align:center
You just focus on
controlling the blast.

00:13:31.519 --> 00:13:34.189 position:50% align:center
It's critical that the
two of you work in sync.

00:13:34.272 --> 00:13:35.899 position:50% align:center
You use your knowledge
of the Nether's layout

00:13:35.982 --> 00:13:37.859 position:50% align:center
to help Maki direct
the flames away from us

00:13:37.942 --> 00:13:39.527 position:50% align:center
while she keeps
them under control!

00:13:39.611 --> 00:13:41.071 position:50% align:center
Understood.

00:13:42.113 --> 00:13:43.365 position:50% align:center
Got a huge reading.

00:13:43.448 --> 00:13:46.284 position:50% align:center
Heat sources within three
kilometers are spiking.

00:13:51.498 --> 00:13:53.541 position:50% align:center
[RITSU laughs]

00:13:53.625 --> 00:13:55.043 position:50% align:center
Explode!

00:14:02.217 --> 00:14:03.677 position:50% align:center
Here goes!

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:06.012 position:50% align:center
First, you need to change the
main explosion's trajectory.

00:14:06.096 --> 00:14:07.681 position:50% align:center
The key is that you push
that initial blast

00:14:07.764 --> 00:14:09.432 position:50% align:center
away from the center
of the cone.

00:14:09.516 --> 00:14:10.934 position:50% align:center
And what should
we do after that?

00:14:11.017 --> 00:14:12.560 position:50% align:center
Where do you want us
to redirect the flames?

00:14:12.644 --> 00:14:14.062 position:50% align:center
[ALL yell]

00:14:15.397 --> 00:14:16.773 position:50% align:center
[screaming]

00:14:16.856 --> 00:14:19.401 position:50% align:center
Send them as deep into the
ground as you can get them!

00:14:19.484 --> 00:14:20.694 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:14:21.986 --> 00:14:27.158 position:50% align:center
[MAKI] I'll take hold of the
flames and I won't let them go.

00:14:27.242 --> 00:14:29.619 position:50% align:center
All the fire around me...

00:14:34.416 --> 00:14:36.710 position:50% align:center
[MAKI]
...is now at my command.

00:14:40.714 --> 00:14:43.508 position:50% align:center
Naturally, this is
only the beginning.

00:14:43.591 --> 00:14:48.513 position:50% align:center
Tokyo's true destruction will
be wrought in due time.

00:14:48.596 --> 00:14:51.266 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:14:51.349 --> 00:14:52.726 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:14:56.229 --> 00:14:59.357 position:50% align:center
All right. You hold the flames
and I'll guide them down.

00:14:59.441 --> 00:15:00.817 position:50% align:center
Got it.

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:02.110 position:50% align:center
[TAKIGI] These passages may
be inaccessible to people,

00:15:02.193 --> 00:15:03.778 position:50% align:center
but not to fire.

00:15:06.823 --> 00:15:09.909 position:50% align:center
Keep it up, you two.
Push that stuff down!

00:15:09.993 --> 00:15:11.911 position:50% align:center
If we encounter a point where
the walls have collapsed

00:15:11.995 --> 00:15:14.205 position:50% align:center
and bare earth is exposed...

00:15:15.832 --> 00:15:18.918 position:50% align:center
...then we can cool the flames
via geothermic dissipation.

00:15:19.002 --> 00:15:20.545 position:50% align:center
Ya care to explain that?

00:15:20.628 --> 00:15:22.047 position:50% align:center
Down at this depth,

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:24.090 position:50% align:center
temperatures above or below
that of the surrounding soil

00:15:24.174 --> 00:15:25.383 position:50% align:center
are gradually absorbed.

00:15:25.467 --> 00:15:26.843 position:50% align:center
Oh. I get it.

00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:29.387 position:50% align:center
Hear that? Just push
the flames down.

00:15:29.471 --> 00:15:30.597 position:50% align:center
[MAKI]
Right!

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.807 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Yeah, corral all
of it into the dirt.

00:15:32.891 --> 00:15:33.975 position:50% align:center
With your power as siblings

00:15:34.059 --> 00:15:37.312 position:50% align:center
and the laws of geothermal
energy combined,

00:15:37.395 --> 00:15:38.563 position:50% align:center
all we need is time

00:15:38.646 --> 00:15:41.483 position:50% align:center
and the earth will cool
those flames for us.

00:15:53.578 --> 00:15:56.289 position:50% align:center
Looks like you pulled it off.

00:15:56.373 --> 00:15:58.583 position:50% align:center
Hinawa, without Maki,

00:15:58.667 --> 00:16:01.878 position:50% align:center
we'd be ash in a Tokyo-sized
crater right now.

00:16:01.961 --> 00:16:04.506 position:50% align:center
She's the very model
of a Fire Soldier,

00:16:04.589 --> 00:16:08.301 position:50% align:center
and a truly essential
member of Company 8.

00:16:08.385 --> 00:16:11.221 position:50% align:center
You were right to
recruit her, Lieutenant.

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:15.892 position:50% align:center
We actually did it.

00:16:15.975 --> 00:16:18.144 position:50% align:center
Listen to me.

00:16:18.228 --> 00:16:22.941 position:50% align:center
This is what I do.
This is what the 8th does.

00:16:27.529 --> 00:16:29.531 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
They failed?

00:16:29.614 --> 00:16:30.949 position:50% align:center
Sucks to suck.

00:16:31.032 --> 00:16:32.784 position:50% align:center
I've got no idea what your
friends were trying to do,

00:16:32.867 --> 00:16:34.369 position:50% align:center
but it sounds like
they came up against

00:16:34.452 --> 00:16:37.330 position:50% align:center
some good old Fire Soldier
teamwork and got folded.

00:16:37.414 --> 00:16:38.498 position:50% align:center
Get down here, Arthur.

00:16:38.581 --> 00:16:41.292 position:50% align:center
Let's give him a taste
of our teamwork.

00:16:45.213 --> 00:16:46.464 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
Non-self.

00:16:46.548 --> 00:16:47.590 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
When did he--?

00:16:47.674 --> 00:16:49.676 position:50% align:center
So much for that plan.

00:16:51.678 --> 00:16:54.347 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
Nirvana. Deliverance.

00:16:54.431 --> 00:16:56.182 position:50% align:center
My mind is beyond reading;

00:16:56.266 --> 00:16:59.811 position:50% align:center
my sword has reached the
realm of the Bodhisattvas.

00:16:59.894 --> 00:17:02.564 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
your brain is just empty.

00:17:02.647 --> 00:17:05.483 position:50% align:center
Also, this is so
not a knight thing.

00:17:05.567 --> 00:17:06.526 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
Non-self.

00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:08.319 position:50% align:center
Without drawing
the breath of life,

00:17:08.403 --> 00:17:10.572 position:50% align:center
a life-taking blow is struck.

00:17:10.655 --> 00:17:12.657 position:50% align:center
Even to a master
of breath-reading,

00:17:12.741 --> 00:17:14.743 position:50% align:center
this blow is
impossible to predict,

00:17:14.826 --> 00:17:18.288 position:50% align:center
and that makes it
all the more fatal.

00:17:18.371 --> 00:17:21.249 position:50% align:center
Heh. Now die, villain.

00:17:21.332 --> 00:17:23.126 position:50% align:center
You didn't hesitate
for a second.

00:17:23.209 --> 00:17:24.544 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI]
Hah.

00:17:24.627 --> 00:17:29.049 position:50% align:center
So even the 8th employs a
cold-blooded professional.

00:17:29.132 --> 00:17:31.801 position:50% align:center
I suppose I was
underestimating you.

00:17:31.885 --> 00:17:35.096 position:50% align:center
Subconsciously, at least.

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:38.725 position:50% align:center
Ew. It's a whole swarm of bugs!

00:17:38.808 --> 00:17:40.393 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
Damn it!

00:17:40.477 --> 00:17:43.229 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI chuckling]

00:17:46.691 --> 00:17:48.360 position:50% align:center
Where'd he go?

00:17:49.402 --> 00:17:50.528 position:50% align:center
Got him.

00:17:50.612 --> 00:17:51.946 position:50% align:center
His head, you dumbass!
That's just a shell!

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:54.115 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI chuckles]

00:17:54.199 --> 00:17:57.702 position:50% align:center
[GIOVANNI] To think I took
part in an Adolla Link.

00:17:57.786 --> 00:18:00.497 position:50% align:center
My research has
been most fruitful.

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:02.874 position:50% align:center
We'll meet again.

00:18:04.084 --> 00:18:06.878 position:50% align:center
[OBI] Have all of your men
been accounted for yet?

00:18:06.961 --> 00:18:09.506 position:50% align:center
[HONDA] We lost more than
I ever could've imagined.

00:18:09.589 --> 00:18:11.174 position:50% align:center
But now I know just
how dangerous

00:18:11.257 --> 00:18:13.635 position:50% align:center
these White-Clad radicals are.

00:18:13.718 --> 00:18:15.387 position:50% align:center
And without Crewman
Oze's assistance,

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:18.014 position:50% align:center
I doubt there'd be anyone
left to mourn them.

00:18:18.098 --> 00:18:20.684 position:50% align:center
Get it? I'm needed.

00:18:20.767 --> 00:18:22.519 position:50% align:center
Do you understand now?

00:18:22.602 --> 00:18:26.439 position:50% align:center
Why my work with the 8th
means so much to me?

00:18:26.523 --> 00:18:29.484 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I see.

00:18:29.567 --> 00:18:30.985 position:50% align:center
But that guy's still garbage!

00:18:31.069 --> 00:18:33.363 position:50% align:center
He just wants to use you
as a human meat shield.

00:18:33.446 --> 00:18:36.324 position:50% align:center
Yeah, uh, listen, sir.

00:18:44.165 --> 00:18:48.420 position:50% align:center
I'd like... to transfer
back to the 8th.

00:18:48.503 --> 00:18:49.629 position:50% align:center
[HINAWA]
Maybe you should.

00:18:49.713 --> 00:18:53.299 position:50% align:center
Your powers make you a
good fit for the Force.

00:18:53.383 --> 00:18:56.136 position:50% align:center
No, sir. My powers aren't
why I fit in here.

00:18:56.219 --> 00:18:58.596 position:50% align:center
It's my ambition and resolve!

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:00.348 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:19:00.432 --> 00:19:01.516 position:50% align:center
Then I'll file the paperwork

00:19:01.599 --> 00:19:03.977 position:50% align:center
to have you transferred
back immediately.

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:07.772 position:50% align:center
Sir, was this some
kind of test, or what?

00:19:07.856 --> 00:19:10.608 position:50% align:center
The White-Clad get more
radical by the day.

00:19:10.692 --> 00:19:12.819 position:50% align:center
I wasn't convinced that
a sheltered girl like you

00:19:12.902 --> 00:19:14.738 position:50% align:center
could deal with them.

00:19:14.821 --> 00:19:15.739 position:50% align:center
Good work today.

00:19:15.822 --> 00:19:17.449 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:21.036 position:50% align:center
Thank you very much, sir.

00:19:21.119 --> 00:19:23.496 position:50% align:center
Back off! You stay
away from her!

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:24.664 position:50% align:center
[MAKI grumbles]

00:19:24.748 --> 00:19:27.042 position:50% align:center
I'm not pickin' up
any more heat sources.

00:19:27.125 --> 00:19:28.752 position:50% align:center
We're out of the woods now.

00:19:28.835 --> 00:19:31.796 position:50% align:center
Search for the remains of those
who fell in the line of duty.

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:34.341 position:50% align:center
Find as many of them as you can.

00:19:34.424 --> 00:19:36.009 position:50% align:center
I'll see that our
wounded comrades

00:19:36.092 --> 00:19:38.261 position:50% align:center
are brought back to base.

00:19:39.804 --> 00:19:41.765 position:50% align:center
To the surface.

00:19:45.685 --> 00:19:49.022 position:50% align:center
It sure is a relief to
see the sun again, huh?

00:19:49.105 --> 00:19:52.108 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] I can't stop thinking
about what Giovanni said.

00:19:52.192 --> 00:19:54.319 position:50% align:center
You can only form an Adolla
Link with someone

00:19:54.402 --> 00:19:56.112 position:50% align:center
who has an Adolla Burst,

00:19:56.196 --> 00:19:59.574 position:50% align:center
or who's been
connected to Adolla.

00:19:59.657 --> 00:20:01.743 position:50% align:center
If that's true...

00:20:03.578 --> 00:20:05.372 position:50% align:center
[2ND CREWMAN B]
He's more or less okay.

00:20:05.455 --> 00:20:06.998 position:50% align:center
He lost his right
hand and left leg

00:20:07.082 --> 00:20:09.626 position:50% align:center
and the rest of him is
either cut or burned,

00:20:09.709 --> 00:20:11.169 position:50% align:center
but his condition's stable.

00:20:11.252 --> 00:20:14.089 position:50% align:center
The kid's got a potato's
will to live.

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:17.467 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI] I'm proud of you
for hanging in there...

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:19.386 position:50% align:center
...till help could come.

00:20:19.469 --> 00:20:20.804 position:50% align:center
Crewman Kotatsu.

00:20:20.887 --> 00:20:24.349 position:50% align:center
It's thanks to your courage
that Juggernaut's alive.

00:20:24.432 --> 00:20:26.559 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:20:26.643 --> 00:20:29.688 position:50% align:center
Honestly, it's me who
should be grateful.

00:20:29.771 --> 00:20:33.274 position:50% align:center
If it weren't for Platoon Leader
Hajiki and Crewman Noto,

00:20:33.358 --> 00:20:36.861 position:50% align:center
I, uh... wouldn't
be here either.

00:20:36.945 --> 00:20:39.406 position:50% align:center
Company 2 was dealt
a stunning blow today,

00:20:39.489 --> 00:20:41.616 position:50% align:center
but the 8th saved us.

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:45.036 position:50% align:center
The army needs to stand
beside the Fire Force.

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:47.330 position:50% align:center
Tokyo has to unite.

00:20:47.414 --> 00:20:50.208 position:50% align:center
I am heartened to see that
we made it through this

00:20:50.291 --> 00:20:53.211 position:50% align:center
without losing you
young crewmen.

00:20:56.214 --> 00:20:58.550 position:50% align:center
[MADOKA]
What is it? Thinking about Maki?

00:20:58.633 --> 00:21:00.635 position:50% align:center
[DANRO grunts]

00:21:00.719 --> 00:21:04.055 position:50% align:center
I understand that she returned
to the Fire Force today.

00:21:04.139 --> 00:21:06.141 position:50% align:center
Are you still worried about her?

00:21:06.224 --> 00:21:10.228 position:50% align:center
I want my daughter to have the
freedom to follow her dreams,

00:21:10.311 --> 00:21:14.232 position:50% align:center
so even though I worry...
I also have faith in her.

00:21:14.315 --> 00:21:17.027 position:50% align:center
After all, she has
superpowers like her mother.

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:19.029 position:50% align:center
I'm not nearly that strong.

00:21:19.112 --> 00:21:20.780 position:50% align:center
Were you unhappy
as well, Madoka?

00:21:20.864 --> 00:21:24.534 position:50% align:center
Giving up the military for
this domestic lifestyle?

00:21:25.744 --> 00:21:29.247 position:50% align:center
Keeping a safe home for my
family is enough for me.

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:33.752 position:50% align:center
But our Maki, she has a
different kind of spirit.

00:21:33.835 --> 00:21:37.505 position:50% align:center
We'll always see her as our
adorable, delicate little girl,

00:21:37.589 --> 00:21:41.426 position:50% align:center
but she has great strength
and a powerful will.

00:21:41.509 --> 00:21:44.471 position:50% align:center
And that is something
she got from you.

00:21:44.554 --> 00:21:46.264 position:50% align:center
[DANRO]
Hm.

00:21:46.348 --> 00:21:48.516 position:50% align:center
[MADOKA] All we can do
now is watch her grow

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:50.560 position:50% align:center
and cheer her on.

00:21:53.605 --> 00:21:56.524 position:50% align:center
[MAKI] Who are you
callin' a gorilla cyclops?!

00:22:00.528 --> 00:22:02.822 position:50% align:center
So you finally made
platoon leader, huh?

00:22:02.906 --> 00:22:06.242 position:50% align:center
We're real happy for ya, Maki.

00:22:06.326 --> 00:22:08.370 position:50% align:center
There's no platoon
to lead, guys.

00:22:08.453 --> 00:22:09.829 position:50% align:center
What's your point?

00:22:09.913 --> 00:22:12.082 position:50% align:center
My point is that nothing
has changed at all.

00:22:12.165 --> 00:22:13.958 position:50% align:center
[ALL laughing]

00:22:14.042 --> 00:22:16.419 position:50% align:center
Seriously, Company 8?
This seems funny to you?

00:22:16.503 --> 00:22:18.213 position:50% align:center
Yeah, little bit.

00:22:21.049 --> 00:22:22.717 position:50% align:center
It feels like the 8th
is just playing

00:22:22.801 --> 00:22:24.427 position:50% align:center
like it's in the Fire Force.

00:22:24.511 --> 00:22:26.346 position:50% align:center
Yeah, they're pretty
much a bunch of idiots.

00:22:26.429 --> 00:22:28.640 position:50% align:center
Well, then why did
you recruit them?

00:22:28.723 --> 00:22:30.350 position:50% align:center
Because...

00:22:34.437 --> 00:22:36.898 position:50% align:center
...those guys are the real deal.

00:24:18.041 --> 00:24:20.001 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
I will try harder, too!

00:24:20.085 --> 00:24:21.711 position:50% align:center
[IRIS]
Next time on <i>Fire Force</i> ,

00:24:21.795 --> 00:24:25.924 position:50% align:center
Season Two, Episode
