00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.188 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Shinra.

00:00:22.272 --> 00:00:24.941 position:50% align:center
I know you had a run in with
Dr. Giovanni in the Nether.

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:26.526 position:50% align:center
What did he say
to you down there?

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:27.902 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Well, sir...

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:32.699 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] He said an Adolla
Link can only happen

00:00:32.782 --> 00:00:34.993 position:50% align:center
between people with
an Adolla Burst,

00:00:35.076 --> 00:00:37.162 position:50% align:center
or those who've been
in contact with Adolla.

00:00:37.245 --> 00:00:39.247 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] So far, you've connected
through an Adolla Link

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.626 position:50% align:center
with Dr. Giovanni... and, uh...

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.421 position:50% align:center
With Lieutenant
Konro of the 7th.

00:00:46.504 --> 00:00:48.340 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Hmm.

00:00:48.423 --> 00:00:51.259 position:50% align:center
Then it seems Lieutenant
Konro is questionable.

00:00:51.343 --> 00:00:52.802 position:50% align:center
Never in a million years!

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:54.387 position:50% align:center
Standing around
arguing about him

00:00:54.471 --> 00:00:56.681 position:50% align:center
is not gonna get
us anywhere, okay?

00:00:56.765 --> 00:00:59.351 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] So I'll go over there
and talk to him in person.

00:00:59.434 --> 00:01:02.145 position:50% align:center
If I can find out why I shared
an Adolla Link with him,

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:05.565 position:50% align:center
it might shed some light
on the Evangelist.

00:01:05.648 --> 00:01:08.485 position:50% align:center
In fact, I'll go over
and see him right now.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.905 position:50% align:center
[VENDOR A]
Hey-hey there, folks!

00:01:11.988 --> 00:01:14.866 position:50% align:center
I'm in a good mood today.
Buy one, get one free!

00:01:14.949 --> 00:01:15.825 position:50% align:center
[GUY A]
You tried that yet?

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:17.494 position:50% align:center
[GUY B]
Thinkin' about it.

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:25.210 position:50% align:center
Man, Asakusa's really
hoppin' today.

00:01:25.293 --> 00:01:28.171 position:50% align:center
Are you sure we shouldn't have
made an appointment first?

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:32.050 position:50% align:center
The guys in Company 7 aren't
all that big on formalities.

00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:35.845 position:50% align:center
So anyway, is there a
reason you came along?

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:38.473 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA] Konro could have
ties to the Evangelist.

00:01:38.556 --> 00:01:40.225 position:50% align:center
And your naive, trusting nature

00:01:40.308 --> 00:01:42.310 position:50% align:center
leads you to get
fooled rather easily.

00:01:42.394 --> 00:01:43.687 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Say what you will about me,

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.399 position:50% align:center
but Lieutenant Konro
is totally on the level.

00:01:47.482 --> 00:01:51.111 position:50% align:center
Oh. The guy from the 8th!
What brings ya here, buddy?

00:01:51.194 --> 00:01:52.654 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] I need to talk
to Lieutenant Konro

00:01:52.737 --> 00:01:54.030 position:50% align:center
about something.

00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:55.949 position:50% align:center
Well, he's not here right now.

00:01:56.032 --> 00:01:58.284 position:50% align:center
He went down the river
over to our storage shed

00:01:58.368 --> 00:01:59.744 position:50% align:center
just outside of town.

00:01:59.828 --> 00:02:03.248 position:50% align:center
Okay, I'll go look for him
there. Good seeing ya!

00:02:03.331 --> 00:02:06.501 position:50% align:center
By the way, you brought this
hottie along for the stroll,

00:02:06.584 --> 00:02:08.044 position:50% align:center
ya naughty devil!

00:02:08.128 --> 00:02:09.129 position:50% align:center
Girlfriend?

00:02:09.212 --> 00:02:10.171 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA]
Girlfriend?

00:02:10.255 --> 00:02:11.297 position:50% align:center
What the hell, man?

00:02:11.381 --> 00:02:13.508 position:50% align:center
This is Captain Hibana
from Company 5!

00:02:13.591 --> 00:02:14.509 position:50% align:center
The captain?

00:02:14.592 --> 00:02:16.302 position:50% align:center
Oh, I'm blushing.

00:02:16.386 --> 00:02:17.512 position:50% align:center
If you want my opinion,

00:02:17.595 --> 00:02:20.306 position:50% align:center
she doesn't seem all
that upset by the idea.

00:02:23.601 --> 00:02:26.146 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA] So he just happened
to run off to this remote shed

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:27.897 position:50% align:center
with no one else around, huh?

00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:30.025 position:50% align:center
Seems highly suspicious to me.

00:02:30.108 --> 00:02:32.402 position:50% align:center
Suspicious? He's just
running errands.

00:02:32.485 --> 00:02:35.071 position:50% align:center
Him being a proto-nationalist
is a red flag, too.

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:36.406 position:50% align:center
Who knows what
he could be doing?

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.491 position:50% align:center
Uh. Hold on.

00:02:38.575 --> 00:02:40.076 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA gasps]

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.494 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA]
A White-Clad?

00:02:41.578 --> 00:02:44.039 position:50% align:center
See, I told you he was iffy!

00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:47.959 position:50% align:center
[KONRO] You've been following
me for days, haven't you?

00:02:48.043 --> 00:02:51.546 position:50% align:center
[WHITE-CLAD A] Ah. You knew
and yet still came here alone?

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:55.383 position:50% align:center
A samurai rendered
a weakling by tephrosis.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.057 position:50% align:center
Let's do this.
I'm sick of waiting around.

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:38.903 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
He's being attacked!

00:04:38.987 --> 00:04:41.364 position:50% align:center
We gotta run over and save
him before it's too late!

00:04:41.448 --> 00:04:44.325 position:50% align:center
Don't be hasty! This may be our
chance to catch him in the act!

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:45.660 position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:04:46.828 --> 00:04:49.581 position:50% align:center
But his tephrosis
makes him vulnerable!

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:53.835 position:50% align:center
[coughs]

00:04:53.918 --> 00:04:57.797 position:50% align:center
[WHITE-CLAD A] Lieutenant
of the 7th, prepare to die!

00:05:12.437 --> 00:05:13.563 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Lieutenant Konro!

00:05:13.646 --> 00:05:15.732 position:50% align:center
[KONRO]
Huh? Shinra?

00:05:19.027 --> 00:05:20.487 position:50% align:center
[KONRO]
All right, so what you're saying

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.406 position:50% align:center
is you and I shared one of
these "Adolla Link" things?

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.075 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:27.410 position:50% align:center
Tell me, have you
had any visions

00:05:27.494 --> 00:05:30.163 position:50% align:center
of a kind of hellish,
alternate world?

00:05:30.246 --> 00:05:31.664 position:50% align:center
[KONRO]
Hmm.

00:05:35.293 --> 00:05:36.753 position:50% align:center
I have, yeah.

00:05:36.836 --> 00:05:40.048 position:50% align:center
Two years ago during the
Great Fire of Asakusa.

00:05:40.131 --> 00:05:42.592 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] When you encountered
the demon, right?

00:05:42.676 --> 00:05:46.971 position:50% align:center
It was. It's also when I came
down with my tephrosis.

00:06:03.196 --> 00:06:04.322 position:50% align:center
[KONRO]
This Infernal,

00:06:04.406 --> 00:06:08.159 position:50% align:center
he was different
from the all others.

00:06:08.243 --> 00:06:12.163 position:50% align:center
But more like...
a mirror image of myself.

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:21.256 position:50% align:center
Did you come here
to take my place?

00:06:25.051 --> 00:06:27.971 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm not gonna
let that happen.

00:06:30.932 --> 00:06:33.226 position:50% align:center
[DEMON INFERNAL A laughs]

00:06:34.936 --> 00:06:37.272 position:50% align:center
[KONRO]
Crimson Moon!

00:06:39.774 --> 00:06:42.527 position:50% align:center
I'll send you back to hell!

00:06:54.622 --> 00:06:56.374 position:50% align:center
If that was some other world,

00:06:56.458 --> 00:06:59.627 position:50% align:center
then I guess I do
have an Adolla Link.

00:06:59.711 --> 00:07:02.047 position:50% align:center
You said that the demon
was like a mirror image.

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.507 position:50% align:center
You felt it was a sort
of doppelganger?

00:07:04.591 --> 00:07:06.968 position:50% align:center
A what? I'm not
familiar with that.

00:07:07.052 --> 00:07:10.055 position:50% align:center
Essentially, a person's double.

00:07:10.138 --> 00:07:12.766 position:50% align:center
There's an old wives' tale that
says somewhere out in the world

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:15.518 position:50% align:center
there's a person who
looks exactly like you,

00:07:15.602 --> 00:07:17.312 position:50% align:center
down to the last detail.

00:07:17.395 --> 00:07:18.605 position:50% align:center
Another "self."

00:07:18.688 --> 00:07:20.857 position:50% align:center
It's a silly fantasy, of course,

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.650 position:50% align:center
but apparently, if you
ever encounter them,

00:07:22.734 --> 00:07:24.152 position:50% align:center
it's either kill or be killed.

00:07:24.235 --> 00:07:25.695 position:50% align:center
Say what?

00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:28.448 position:50% align:center
I definitely got the feeling
that he came here to kill me.

00:07:28.531 --> 00:07:30.742 position:50% align:center
But since you're a big,
tough Fire Soldier,

00:07:30.825 --> 00:07:32.702 position:50% align:center
the demon was slain
instead that day.

00:07:32.786 --> 00:07:34.996 position:50% align:center
Of course you wouldn't
lose, Lieutenant.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.915 position:50% align:center
[KONRO]
Give me a break.

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:42.837 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA] I believe I need
to do some research

00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:44.756 position:50% align:center
into this doppelganger theory.

00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:47.842 position:50% align:center
[KONRO] So you're
sophisticated and smart, huh?

00:07:47.926 --> 00:07:50.845 position:50% align:center
Anyway, why'd the
White-Clad target me?

00:07:50.929 --> 00:07:52.639 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Maybe it has something
to do with the fact

00:07:52.722 --> 00:07:54.683 position:50% align:center
that you've seen Adolla?

00:07:55.642 --> 00:07:56.935 position:50% align:center
Your scar.

00:07:57.018 --> 00:07:59.104 position:50% align:center
From what I can tell,
those who've seen Adolla

00:07:59.187 --> 00:08:01.815 position:50% align:center
tend to get some kind
of disfigurement.

00:08:02.857 --> 00:08:05.735 position:50% align:center
[KONRO]
Ah, I'm not the only one.

00:08:05.819 --> 00:08:07.445 position:50% align:center
Still, why us, then?

00:08:07.529 --> 00:08:09.155 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA]
Does it pose some threat to them

00:08:09.239 --> 00:08:12.492 position:50% align:center
for there to be people out
there who've seen Adolla?

00:08:15.578 --> 00:08:18.331 position:50% align:center
Really? Konro,
you were attacked?

00:08:18.415 --> 00:08:20.250 position:50% align:center
He'd been tailing
me for a while.

00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:22.877 position:50% align:center
I figured he wouldn't do
anything until I was alone.

00:08:22.961 --> 00:08:26.464 position:50% align:center
You shoulda seen it!
He took him down in one blow!

00:08:28.675 --> 00:08:31.678 position:50% align:center
What was that all
about, you barbarian?

00:08:31.761 --> 00:08:33.138 position:50% align:center
Dodged it in time.

00:08:33.221 --> 00:08:35.098 position:50% align:center
Only because you taught
me how to listen

00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:37.017 position:50% align:center
for the breath of life, Captain.

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:38.643 position:50% align:center
I guess that means
your fighting skills

00:08:38.727 --> 00:08:40.562 position:50% align:center
are finally worth a damn, huh?

00:08:40.645 --> 00:08:44.315 position:50% align:center
Maybe, but the White-Clad
are becoming more powerful, too.

00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:48.028 position:50% align:center
Even my Rapid and Corna
won't work on some of them.

00:08:48.111 --> 00:08:49.779 position:50% align:center
So let me ask you,

00:08:49.863 --> 00:08:52.782 position:50% align:center
how would you fight against
someone like that?

00:08:53.908 --> 00:08:56.119 position:50% align:center
Perhaps you can pull it off now.

00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:57.579 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:02.125 position:50% align:center
The Hysterical Strength
of Fight or Flight.

00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:04.127 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] "Hysterical
Strength"? What's that?

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:05.420 position:50% align:center
[HIBANA]
In that moment of crisis

00:09:05.503 --> 00:09:06.796 position:50% align:center
when you overcome your limits

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.007 position:50% align:center
and release all the power
deep inside of you,

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:12.218 position:50% align:center
it's known as tapping into
your "Hysterical Strength."

00:09:12.302 --> 00:09:14.179 position:50% align:center
Yeah? How do you make it happen?

00:09:14.262 --> 00:09:16.931 position:50% align:center
I don't know. Figure it out.

00:09:17.015 --> 00:09:21.394 position:50% align:center
Now, Waka, you can't just bring
it up and leave it at that.

00:09:21.478 --> 00:09:23.104 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:09:24.606 --> 00:09:26.983 position:50% align:center
Go round up the rooks
in your company,

00:09:27.067 --> 00:09:29.736 position:50% align:center
'cause I do not wanna explain
this more than once.

00:09:29.819 --> 00:09:31.112 position:50% align:center
Lucky dog.

00:09:31.196 --> 00:09:33.490 position:50% align:center
Waka's gonna give you his
personal training again.

00:09:33.573 --> 00:09:36.201 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Thank you, sir!

00:09:36.284 --> 00:09:38.620 position:50% align:center
I can't wait to get stronger!

00:09:45.126 --> 00:09:46.294 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:09:46.378 --> 00:09:50.298 position:50% align:center
The Knight-Samurai
returns to grace Asakusa.

00:09:50.382 --> 00:09:52.467 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't Samurai-Knight
make more sense?

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:55.428 position:50% align:center
I mean, you're
becoming a samurai.

00:09:55.512 --> 00:09:59.015 position:50% align:center
Why do I take the bait?
Let's go in!

00:09:59.099 --> 00:10:00.642 position:50% align:center
Hey, we're here
for the training!

00:10:00.725 --> 00:10:02.310 position:50% align:center
You're here early.

00:10:02.394 --> 00:10:05.146 position:50% align:center
Is it an Empire thing to
show up ahead of time?

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:07.315 position:50% align:center
And I see you brought
topknot with you.

00:10:07.399 --> 00:10:09.609 position:50% align:center
Actually, there's another one.

00:10:09.693 --> 00:10:10.985 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:10:13.113 --> 00:10:14.739 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
Crewman Kotatsu, reporting!

00:10:14.823 --> 00:10:17.659 position:50% align:center
I ask that you please
train me, as well!

00:10:42.058 --> 00:10:45.145 position:50% align:center
Here already? Way too early.

00:10:45.228 --> 00:10:47.772 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Thanks again
for agreeing to train us.

00:10:49.899 --> 00:10:54.195 position:50% align:center
Hm. Hold on. There's
another one with you?

00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:55.822 position:50% align:center
I'm well aware that
I'm not at the level

00:10:55.905 --> 00:10:58.366 position:50% align:center
where I'm ready to receive
your training, Captain.

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:01.870 position:50% align:center
But still, I wanna grow past
the weak person I am now.

00:11:01.953 --> 00:11:04.831 position:50% align:center
So would you please
allow me to observe?

00:11:04.914 --> 00:11:06.833 position:50% align:center
Wanna get stronger, huh?

00:11:06.916 --> 00:11:08.501 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir!

00:11:08.585 --> 00:11:10.086 position:50% align:center
Why is that?

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:13.006 position:50% align:center
Because I'm sick
of being helpless.

00:11:13.089 --> 00:11:15.759 position:50% align:center
I'm a burden on the
all other crewmen.

00:11:15.842 --> 00:11:17.761 position:50% align:center
And there have been lives lost
that could've been saved

00:11:17.844 --> 00:11:20.847 position:50% align:center
if I were stronger
and more capable.

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:23.224 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU]
So you're giving me a sob story?

00:11:23.308 --> 00:11:27.645 position:50% align:center
I'm not, sir!
I'm resolving to give more!

00:11:27.729 --> 00:11:29.564 position:50% align:center
I understand.

00:11:29.647 --> 00:11:31.358 position:50% align:center
But I'm afraid that
just observing us

00:11:31.441 --> 00:11:33.610 position:50% align:center
is likely to bore you
out of your mind.

00:11:33.693 --> 00:11:34.903 position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:11:36.196 --> 00:11:37.489 position:50% align:center
[HIKAGE, HINATA]
What is it, Waka?

00:11:37.572 --> 00:11:39.783 position:50% align:center
Go and have some fun
with that girl, would you?

00:11:39.866 --> 00:11:41.409 position:50% align:center
[HIKAGE, HINATA]
Who? The airhead?

00:11:41.493 --> 00:11:42.118 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:11:42.202 --> 00:11:45.997 position:50% align:center
[BOTH laugh]

00:11:46.081 --> 00:11:48.291 position:50% align:center
So what game do you
wanna play, you hussy?

00:11:48.375 --> 00:11:50.126 position:50% align:center
Whatever it is,
it better be fun,

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:51.378 position:50% align:center
you hear me, you tramp?

00:11:51.461 --> 00:11:53.797 position:50% align:center
Uh, wha--? Kusakabe?

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:56.925 position:50% align:center
You will definitely not
be bored with those two.

00:11:57.008 --> 00:11:59.260 position:50% align:center
Listen, it's an exercise.

00:11:59.344 --> 00:12:02.514 position:50% align:center
I'm going to gauge your strength
by the way you play with them.

00:12:02.597 --> 00:12:04.766 position:50% align:center
Uh. Okay.

00:12:06.976 --> 00:12:08.603 position:50% align:center
[7TH CREWMAN A] Lieutenant,
aren't you going to watch

00:12:08.687 --> 00:12:10.355 position:50% align:center
the rookies from the 8th?

00:12:10.438 --> 00:12:12.774 position:50% align:center
I'll go and watch once
I'm finished with this.

00:12:12.857 --> 00:12:15.735 position:50% align:center
[7TH CREWMAN A] I can take care
of that for you. Enjoy yourself.

00:12:15.819 --> 00:12:18.613 position:50% align:center
[KONRO] It's my chore
today. I don't mind.

00:12:23.493 --> 00:12:24.828 position:50% align:center
All right, twerp.

00:12:24.911 --> 00:12:27.414 position:50% align:center
Waka says you gotta keep away
from us for one minute.

00:12:27.497 --> 00:12:28.748 position:50% align:center
Just like a game of tag!

00:12:28.832 --> 00:12:30.291 position:50% align:center
[HIKAGE, HINATA]
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry...!

00:12:30.375 --> 00:12:32.043 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
Okay, okay, I get it already.

00:12:32.127 --> 00:12:34.713 position:50% align:center
I do know how to play tag.

00:12:34.796 --> 00:12:36.631 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI] I should probably
go easy on them.

00:12:36.715 --> 00:12:38.842 position:50% align:center
If I outran them so quickly
that it made them cry,

00:12:38.925 --> 00:12:40.510 position:50% align:center
it would be pretty awkward.

00:12:40.593 --> 00:12:41.886 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
Here I go!

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:43.888 position:50% align:center
[HIKAGE, HINATA]
Don't screw with us!

00:12:43.972 --> 00:12:45.557 position:50% align:center
Jeez! That hurt!

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:46.641 position:50% align:center
[HIKAGE, HINATA]
Run like you mean it,

00:12:46.725 --> 00:12:47.892 position:50% align:center
or we're gonna kill you!

00:12:47.976 --> 00:12:49.811 position:50% align:center
Damn it. Little brats.

00:12:49.894 --> 00:12:51.187 position:50% align:center
You know that ladies
shouldn't use

00:12:51.271 --> 00:12:52.731 position:50% align:center
potty language like "damn it"!

00:12:52.814 --> 00:12:54.107 position:50% align:center
And if you call us names,

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:56.192 position:50% align:center
we'll dump you right
in the Sumida River.

00:12:56.276 --> 00:12:58.028 position:50% align:center
You want me to run
like I mean it?

00:12:58.111 --> 00:13:01.948 position:50% align:center
Well, don't come cryin'
to me if you can't keep up!

00:13:02.032 --> 00:13:04.117 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI] This is stupid.
What's the point?

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.829 position:50% align:center
I didn't come all the way here
to play children's games.

00:13:07.912 --> 00:13:10.123 position:50% align:center
I need to close the gap
with Shinra and Arthur,

00:13:10.206 --> 00:13:11.791 position:50% align:center
even just a little bit.

00:13:11.875 --> 00:13:12.959 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:18.465 position:50% align:center
[HIKAGE] We told you not
to hold back, you ugly pig.

00:13:18.548 --> 00:13:19.841 position:50% align:center
Do you really wanna
get stronger,

00:13:19.924 --> 00:13:21.509 position:50% align:center
or keep being a piece of crap?

00:13:21.593 --> 00:13:23.678 position:50% align:center
Trust me, we're being
nice right now.

00:13:23.762 --> 00:13:25.972 position:50% align:center
So don't take us lightly.

00:13:26.056 --> 00:13:29.351 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI] Okay, these
girls are kinda scary.

00:13:32.187 --> 00:13:34.647 position:50% align:center
Suppose we should get started.

00:13:34.731 --> 00:13:37.275 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir, I'm ready!

00:13:37.359 --> 00:13:39.110 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:13:39.194 --> 00:13:41.529 position:50% align:center
[PEOPLE chattering]

00:13:41.613 --> 00:13:44.449 position:50% align:center
Captain Shinmon,
is this really training?

00:13:52.207 --> 00:13:55.877 position:50% align:center
I reckon I haven't seen a sight
quite like this in a dog's age.

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:59.506 position:50% align:center
Another peaceful,
quiet day in Asakusa.

00:13:59.589 --> 00:14:01.675 position:50% align:center
Oh, this sucks! Like, for real!

00:14:01.758 --> 00:14:04.552 position:50% align:center
It's so hot,
I can barely stand it!

00:14:04.636 --> 00:14:07.514 position:50% align:center
Kind of a day where you
forget your troubles.

00:14:08.973 --> 00:14:11.017 position:50% align:center
[groaning]

00:14:11.101 --> 00:14:14.562 position:50% align:center
[HIKAGE, HINATA] Eight seconds!
That's nowhere near a minute!

00:14:14.646 --> 00:14:16.147 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I get it.

00:14:16.231 --> 00:14:18.566 position:50% align:center
Well, just wait till
you get a load of this!

00:14:22.904 --> 00:14:24.197 position:50% align:center
Playtime's over.

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:27.617 position:50% align:center
Go on and catch me if you
can, you little weirdos!

00:14:27.701 --> 00:14:29.619 position:50% align:center
Guess she's fired up now, Hina.

00:14:29.703 --> 00:14:32.288 position:50% align:center
We should get moving, too, Hika.

00:14:33.998 --> 00:14:35.917 position:50% align:center
Here we come!

00:14:37.627 --> 00:14:39.796 position:50% align:center
Woo-hoo!

00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:42.007 position:50% align:center
Don't blame me for
burning your kimonos.

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:43.383 position:50% align:center
[HINATA]
Dream on!

00:14:43.466 --> 00:14:44.843 position:50% align:center
Five seconds!

00:14:44.926 --> 00:14:47.345 position:50% align:center
How lame. Worse than last time.

00:14:47.429 --> 00:14:50.306 position:50% align:center
Her "getting serious"
is pretty funny.

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:52.976 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
That was a warmup. Let's go!

00:14:53.059 --> 00:14:55.729 position:50% align:center
I think a minute might be
totally out of her reach.

00:14:55.812 --> 00:14:58.064 position:50% align:center
Thirty seconds'd be a miracle.

00:14:58.148 --> 00:15:03.737 position:50% align:center
I'll show these brats.
I'm a real Fire Soldier.

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:06.114 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI'S MOTHER]
How's school going, Tamaki?

00:15:06.197 --> 00:15:07.949 position:50% align:center
You getting your
nun's credentials?

00:15:08.033 --> 00:15:09.200 position:50% align:center
We're not a clerical family,

00:15:09.284 --> 00:15:11.369 position:50% align:center
so that means I have to
take a lot more tests,

00:15:11.453 --> 00:15:13.371 position:50% align:center
but the teacher says
I'm doing just fine.

00:15:13.455 --> 00:15:16.082 position:50% align:center
Don't push yourself too hard.

00:15:16.166 --> 00:15:19.961 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI] Just because...
Mom and Dad wanted me to.

00:15:20.045 --> 00:15:22.881 position:50% align:center
[CLASSMATE A]
Hey, Tamaki! Good morning!

00:15:22.964 --> 00:15:24.257 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
Good morning.

00:15:24.341 --> 00:15:25.842 position:50% align:center
Oh, your badge!

00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:28.720 position:50% align:center
Cool, huh? I'm officially
a Sister now!

00:15:28.803 --> 00:15:30.555 position:50% align:center
I still have to take
the written test

00:15:30.638 --> 00:15:31.639 position:50% align:center
and go through the interview

00:15:31.723 --> 00:15:33.683 position:50% align:center
before it becomes
official for me.

00:15:33.767 --> 00:15:36.019 position:50% align:center
Well, you're a smart cookie,
so you'll do fine.

00:15:36.102 --> 00:15:38.730 position:50% align:center
Just hang in there. Remember...

00:15:38.813 --> 00:15:42.734 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI] And because
everyone else was doing it.

00:15:42.817 --> 00:15:44.194 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:15:44.277 --> 00:15:46.071 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Tamaki!

00:15:46.154 --> 00:15:48.448 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI] And because I
tripped at the right time.

00:15:48.531 --> 00:15:50.742 position:50% align:center
Are you okay? That looked
like it really hurt.

00:15:50.825 --> 00:15:51.910 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:51.993 --> 00:15:53.953 position:50% align:center
Something the matter?

00:15:54.037 --> 00:15:57.374 position:50% align:center
[CLASSMATE A] There's fire
coming from your bottom!

00:15:57.457 --> 00:16:00.460 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI] And because
I started making flames.

00:16:01.419 --> 00:16:02.045 position:50% align:center
[BOTH laugh]

00:16:02.128 --> 00:16:03.421 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI yells]

00:16:03.505 --> 00:16:05.215 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
Crap! How long was that?

00:16:05.298 --> 00:16:06.257 position:50% align:center
[HIKAGE]
Twelve seconds.

00:16:06.341 --> 00:16:07.384 position:50% align:center
[HINATA]
Better than the other times.

00:16:07.467 --> 00:16:09.969 position:50% align:center
Let's go again!

00:16:10.053 --> 00:16:11.429 position:50% align:center
[CLASSMATE B]
That is so amazing!

00:16:11.513 --> 00:16:12.681 position:50% align:center
If you're a third gen,

00:16:12.764 --> 00:16:14.265 position:50% align:center
does that mean you're
gonna be a Fire Soldier?

00:16:14.349 --> 00:16:15.892 position:50% align:center
[CLASSMATE C]
A Fire Soldier Sister?

00:16:15.975 --> 00:16:17.310 position:50% align:center
That would be awesome!

00:16:17.394 --> 00:16:19.771 position:50% align:center
You'd enlist with
the 1st, wouldn't you?

00:16:19.854 --> 00:16:22.440 position:50% align:center
Are they the best one?

00:16:22.524 --> 00:16:23.525 position:50% align:center
Look there!

00:16:23.608 --> 00:16:25.318 position:50% align:center
Wow!

00:16:25.402 --> 00:16:28.113 position:50% align:center
[CLASSMATE A]
It's Lieutenant Rekka Hoshimiya!

00:16:28.196 --> 00:16:30.115 position:50% align:center
He's so cool.

00:16:30.198 --> 00:16:31.908 position:50% align:center
Ah, what's going on, girls?

00:16:31.991 --> 00:16:34.703 position:50% align:center
If you wanna get a closer look,
just come over here!

00:16:34.786 --> 00:16:36.162 position:50% align:center
And we'd love for you to enlist,

00:16:36.246 --> 00:16:38.915 position:50% align:center
'cause the 1st is always
lookin' for tomorrow's stars!

00:16:38.998 --> 00:16:39.958 position:50% align:center
Oh, no, he saw us!

00:16:40.041 --> 00:16:41.042 position:50% align:center
What do we do?

00:16:41.126 --> 00:16:42.794 position:50% align:center
Run away?

00:16:42.877 --> 00:16:44.879 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
Also, just like everybody else,

00:16:44.963 --> 00:16:48.466 position:50% align:center
I looked up to Lieutenant Rekka.

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:53.513 position:50% align:center
It was all simply because...
I wanted to make everyone happy.

00:16:54.764 --> 00:16:56.099 position:50% align:center
Mom and Dad!

00:16:56.182 --> 00:16:59.978 position:50% align:center
I wanna become a Sister
and enlist in Company 1!

00:17:02.355 --> 00:17:05.025 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI] That's why I
became a Fire Soldier.

00:17:05.108 --> 00:17:06.484 position:50% align:center
[REKKA]
I'll be right beside you,

00:17:06.568 --> 00:17:08.945 position:50% align:center
all the way to the
end, okay, Tamaki?

00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:11.281 position:50% align:center
You said you would
do anything for me,

00:17:11.364 --> 00:17:14.117 position:50% align:center
so die in my place!

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.453 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
Please. Defeat him.

00:17:16.536 --> 00:17:19.873 position:50% align:center
You can't let
Lieutenant Rekka win.

00:17:19.956 --> 00:17:23.084 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Don't worry.
The hero always wins.

00:17:23.168 --> 00:17:25.170 position:50% align:center
I'll show 'em all!

00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:31.134 position:50% align:center
--[HINATA] Too bad!
--Eighteen seconds, hussy!

00:17:31.217 --> 00:17:32.385 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
I wanna change!

00:17:32.469 --> 00:17:33.303 position:50% align:center
Hika.

00:17:33.386 --> 00:17:34.846 position:50% align:center
Hina.

00:17:34.929 --> 00:17:38.266 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI] Everyone else has been
carrying me this whole time.

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:41.603 position:50% align:center
I know it's not going to be
that easy for me to change,

00:17:41.686 --> 00:17:45.106 position:50% align:center
but all the others
are trying so hard.

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:48.360 position:50% align:center
So that means...
I gotta do it, too.

00:17:48.443 --> 00:17:50.737 position:50% align:center
I've gotta try even harder!

00:17:53.406 --> 00:17:55.408 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI gasps]

00:17:55.492 --> 00:17:56.993 position:50% align:center
[HINATA]
Thirty seconds left.

00:17:57.077 --> 00:17:59.704 position:50% align:center
[HIKAGE]
So we're gonna go all out, too.

00:17:59.788 --> 00:18:03.041 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI] There's no way
I'll let you catch me.

00:18:03.124 --> 00:18:04.334 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI yelps]

00:18:06.169 --> 00:18:07.921 position:50% align:center
Oh, I'm so sorry!

00:18:08.004 --> 00:18:10.965 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI] No, it's my fault.
It was my Lecher Lure.

00:18:14.886 --> 00:18:15.845 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI gasps]

00:18:15.929 --> 00:18:17.347 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you
already knew this,

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:21.351 position:50% align:center
but that guy you pounced on
earlier, he's my boyfriend.

00:18:21.434 --> 00:18:22.936 position:50% align:center
And this "Lecher Lure" crap?

00:18:23.019 --> 00:18:26.481 position:50% align:center
Admit you did it on
purpose, you ugly skank!

00:18:26.564 --> 00:18:31.277 position:50% align:center
Sorry. But it really was just
an accident, I promise.

00:18:32.779 --> 00:18:36.491 position:50% align:center
You should go sit in the corner
so you don't bother anyone else!

00:18:40.036 --> 00:18:41.037 position:50% align:center
[CLASSMATE E]
Can't believe you still wear

00:18:41.121 --> 00:18:42.997 position:50% align:center
twin-tails in middle school.

00:18:43.081 --> 00:18:46.501 position:50% align:center
Trying to flirt with those,
you cow? Get over there!

00:18:47.669 --> 00:18:50.755 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI] Are twin-tails
supposed to be flirty?

00:18:50.839 --> 00:18:54.759 position:50% align:center
They're fun, like
floppy animal ears.

00:18:58.555 --> 00:19:00.682 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
Being a cat must be nice.

00:19:00.765 --> 00:19:03.560 position:50% align:center
They don't get creeped on.

00:19:03.643 --> 00:19:10.150 position:50% align:center
I wish I could be like
them... quick and agile.

00:19:10.233 --> 00:19:11.901 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
Just like a cat!

00:19:14.696 --> 00:19:15.780 position:50% align:center
[MAN A]
Hey!

00:19:29.586 --> 00:19:30.628 position:50% align:center
[HINATA]
Forty seconds!

00:19:30.712 --> 00:19:33.048 position:50% align:center
This is bad, Hika.
She might get away!

00:19:33.131 --> 00:19:34.883 position:50% align:center
[HIKAGE]
Not gonna happen!

00:19:36.092 --> 00:19:37.635 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
They're catching up!

00:19:39.179 --> 00:19:42.182 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
I wanna be nimble like a cat!

00:19:43.391 --> 00:19:45.435 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
Fifteen seconds left!

00:19:53.902 --> 00:19:55.612 position:50% align:center
[clatter]

00:19:55.695 --> 00:19:57.822 position:50% align:center
Why're you in the
corner by yourself?

00:19:57.906 --> 00:19:59.324 position:50% align:center
Come and sit with me.

00:19:59.407 --> 00:20:00.700 position:50% align:center
If I sit over there,

00:20:00.784 --> 00:20:03.745 position:50% align:center
my Lecher Lure is just gonna
cause problems for you.

00:20:03.828 --> 00:20:05.372 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA sighs]

00:20:08.917 --> 00:20:09.834 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI gasps]

00:20:09.918 --> 00:20:11.670 position:50% align:center
Well, then I'll
sit in the corner.

00:20:11.753 --> 00:20:13.463 position:50% align:center
You can have the table.

00:20:13.546 --> 00:20:15.674 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
Nah, It's okay. I'm used to it.

00:20:15.757 --> 00:20:18.259 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] I bet I'm more used
to sitting in the corner.

00:20:18.343 --> 00:20:20.595 position:50% align:center
Give the "devil" his due.

00:20:21.429 --> 00:20:22.555 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
Stop!

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:26.434 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
Put me down!

00:20:26.518 --> 00:20:28.353 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
What's even happening?

00:20:28.436 --> 00:20:31.106 position:50% align:center
Look, things are better if
I stay in the corner, okay?

00:20:31.189 --> 00:20:33.358 position:50% align:center
I'm not gonna pretend
things don't get awkward,

00:20:33.441 --> 00:20:35.944 position:50% align:center
but you don't have
to stay away forever.

00:20:37.654 --> 00:20:38.822 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
I mean, look at that idiot.

00:20:38.905 --> 00:20:40.865 position:50% align:center
He's a peon, but he sits
at the head of the table

00:20:40.949 --> 00:20:42.951 position:50% align:center
like it's his personal banquet.

00:20:43.034 --> 00:20:45.120 position:50% align:center
You just need some confidence.

00:20:52.627 --> 00:20:55.463 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI] My days of skulking
in the corner are over!

00:20:55.547 --> 00:20:57.382 position:50% align:center
[HIKAGE]
Why'd you stop all of a sudden?

00:20:57.465 --> 00:20:59.634 position:50% align:center
[HINATA]
This mean you're giving up?

00:20:59.718 --> 00:21:03.596 position:50% align:center
These last ten seconds...
I'm not gonna run away!

00:21:06.016 --> 00:21:07.767 position:50% align:center
I'm bustin' through.

00:21:07.851 --> 00:21:09.644 position:50% align:center
[HINATA]
She's coming after us, huh?

00:21:09.728 --> 00:21:11.896 position:50% align:center
[HIKAGE] She had a better
chance running away.

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:13.523 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Unite!

00:21:15.525 --> 00:21:17.485 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Mother Fox!

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:22.574 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna tear right
through you!

00:21:23.616 --> 00:21:26.619 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
Nekomata Fireball!

00:21:32.917 --> 00:21:35.253 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
We're not done yet, damn you!

00:21:35.337 --> 00:21:37.213 position:50% align:center
That was 60 seconds.

00:21:37.297 --> 00:21:38.757 position:50% align:center
I'm not quite sure why,

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:42.010 position:50% align:center
but you seem to have a habit
of suppressing your own power.

00:21:42.093 --> 00:21:44.471 position:50% align:center
Captain Shinmon, you're here?

00:21:45.972 --> 00:21:48.683 position:50% align:center
But you're starting
to shed that habit.

00:21:50.977 --> 00:21:52.479 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
Thanks for your help, sir.

00:21:52.562 --> 00:21:54.689 position:50% align:center
But that's shedding
a little too much.

00:21:54.773 --> 00:21:56.066 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, sir!

00:21:56.149 --> 00:21:58.068 position:50% align:center
[HINATA, HIKAGE]
Hussy!

00:21:58.151 --> 00:22:00.111 position:50% align:center
Is just a simple
game of tag enough

00:22:00.195 --> 00:22:03.448 position:50% align:center
to really make a
lasting change in me?

00:22:03.531 --> 00:22:06.409 position:50% align:center
[BENIMARU] If you can't take a
simple game like this seriously,

00:22:06.493 --> 00:22:09.704 position:50% align:center
I doubt you'd have a chance when
you're really playing for keeps.

00:22:09.788 --> 00:22:13.458 position:50% align:center
But now, you've finally
taken up the gauntlet.

00:22:13.541 --> 00:22:15.001 position:50% align:center
Keep at it.

00:22:18.755 --> 00:22:20.882 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
Thank you very much, sir!

00:22:20.965 --> 00:22:24.302 position:50% align:center
How exactly am I supposed
to respond to that?

00:22:25.387 --> 00:22:27.013 position:50% align:center
[MAMORU-KUN]
Oh, my.

00:22:35.814 --> 00:22:37.440 position:50% align:center
Where did you go,
Captain Shinmon?!

00:22:37.524 --> 00:22:38.692 position:50% align:center
You can't leave us here!

00:22:38.775 --> 00:22:39.776 position:50% align:center
If I didn't know better,

00:22:39.859 --> 00:22:42.112 position:50% align:center
I'd think he's forgotten
all about us!

00:24:15.038 --> 00:24:19.292 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] In the face of death,
my nerves make me smile.

00:24:19.376 --> 00:24:21.211 position:50% align:center
[IRIS]
