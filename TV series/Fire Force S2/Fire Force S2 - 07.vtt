00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:21.771 position:50% align:center
[OBI] Causes of death
are many and varied.

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:25.191 position:50% align:center
Old age. Illness. Suicide.

00:00:25.275 --> 00:00:27.027 position:50% align:center
But out of that long,
morbid list,

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.739 position:50% align:center
there's one end that people
fear above all others.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.785 position:50% align:center line:10%
[OBI]
Death by fire.

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:45.920 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Whoa! Holy crap!

00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:47.088 position:50% align:center
I can actually see it now!

00:00:47.172 --> 00:00:48.131 position:50% align:center
So awesome!

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:49.507 position:50% align:center
Wow!

00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:51.301 position:50% align:center
Our Avalon draws near.

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:54.012 position:50% align:center
It looks more like the Empire
than I thought it would.

00:00:54.095 --> 00:00:55.597 position:50% align:center
In fact, it's a bit prettier.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.141 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT]
It's good to be back home.

00:00:58.224 --> 00:01:01.019 position:50% align:center
[whistle blowing]

00:01:08.985 --> 00:01:11.696 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Oh, yeah! First!

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.949 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA, ARTHUR] Woo! We just
set foot on Chinese soil!

00:01:15.033 --> 00:01:17.702 position:50% align:center
[OGUN] Have we though?
We're still on the dock.

00:01:17.786 --> 00:01:19.746 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Let's find some soil!

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:20.288 position:50% align:center
Nice!

00:01:20.372 --> 00:01:21.623 position:50% align:center
It's beautiful!

00:01:21.706 --> 00:01:24.334 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it almost looks
good enough to eat, right?

00:01:25.293 --> 00:01:26.378 position:50% align:center
Yummy!

00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:28.630 position:50% align:center
No, it's not! It just
tastes like dirt!

00:01:28.713 --> 00:01:31.132 position:50% align:center
Think you guys need
to calm it down a bit.

00:01:31.216 --> 00:01:33.051 position:50% align:center
Hey, Lieutenant Pa--

00:01:33.134 --> 00:01:34.511 position:50% align:center
[PAN] It feels like we're
back at the academy.

00:01:34.594 --> 00:01:36.805 position:50% align:center
The heck did you
teach them there?

00:01:36.888 --> 00:01:38.932 position:50% align:center
[whistle blows]

00:01:39.015 --> 00:01:41.351 position:50% align:center
Enjoy New Qingdao while
you can, all right?

00:01:41.434 --> 00:01:43.228 position:50% align:center
Once I get supplies
from the garrison,

00:01:43.311 --> 00:01:44.938 position:50% align:center
we're gonna have
to roll on through.

00:01:45.021 --> 00:01:45.897 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT]
I'll show you the way.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.357 position:50% align:center
Howdy, Takeru!

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.275 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT]
Uh. Ma!

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:51.277 position:50% align:center
Ya come out here
just to meet me?

00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:52.654 position:50% align:center
You bet'cher tater!

00:01:52.737 --> 00:01:55.073 position:50% align:center
My son done come home,
don't'cha know?

00:01:55.156 --> 00:01:57.659 position:50% align:center
Hi there. So you're Noto's mom?

00:01:57.742 --> 00:01:59.160 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT]
She sure is.

00:01:59.244 --> 00:02:01.162 position:50% align:center
Ya make out the
family resemblance?

00:02:01.246 --> 00:02:04.165 position:50% align:center
He's my pride 'n joy.
'Preciate ya watchin' him.

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:05.500 position:50% align:center
Glad to help, ma'am.

00:02:05.583 --> 00:02:07.293 position:50% align:center
Say, why don't the
two of you catch up

00:02:07.377 --> 00:02:09.129 position:50% align:center
while I get our
supplies together?

00:02:09.212 --> 00:02:10.964 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT]
Huh? Ya sure 'bout that?

00:02:11.047 --> 00:02:13.550 position:50% align:center
Thanks so much.
We mighty grateful.

00:02:16.594 --> 00:02:20.140 position:50% align:center
Well, Takeru. Seems to me
ya done got even bigger.

00:02:20.223 --> 00:02:22.642 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT]
Oh. Ya reckon?

00:02:22.726 --> 00:02:25.478 position:50% align:center
Well, anyway, how's Pa
been holdin' up?

00:02:25.562 --> 00:02:26.813 position:50% align:center
You got your own troubles now,

00:02:26.896 --> 00:02:28.857 position:50% align:center
so don't'cha go
frettin' about us.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.066 position:50% align:center
Just work hard 'n find yourself

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.444 position:50% align:center
a purdy lil' Tokyo
bride to bring home.

00:02:32.527 --> 00:02:35.113 position:50% align:center
That'll make us happy as larks.

00:02:35.196 --> 00:02:36.740 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT]
Is somethin' wrong, Ma?

00:02:36.823 --> 00:02:39.034 position:50% align:center
Ya look a lil' wore down.

00:02:39.117 --> 00:02:41.828 position:50% align:center
Nothin' gets past you.
It's fine though.

00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:45.123 position:50% align:center
Ya came here to do a mission,
right? Just keep mindin' that.

00:02:45.206 --> 00:02:46.750 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT]
So somethin' is wrong!

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:48.585 position:50% align:center
You gotta tell me.

00:02:50.545 --> 00:02:53.715 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT] Well, golly Bob!
Somebody done tore up the field.

00:02:53.798 --> 00:02:55.633 position:50% align:center
[MRS. NOTO]
Just a mite bit of it.

00:02:55.717 --> 00:02:57.594 position:50% align:center
We're friendly with all
the folk round here,

00:02:57.677 --> 00:02:59.888 position:50% align:center
which just makes this
more perplexin'.

00:02:59.971 --> 00:03:01.848 position:50% align:center
Who in tarnation would do this?

00:03:01.931 --> 00:03:04.100 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:05.977 position:50% align:center
[PAN]
Thank you very much.

00:03:06.061 --> 00:03:07.896 position:50% align:center
Just where is your team heading?

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:09.773 position:50% align:center
A fair distance west of here.

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:12.400 position:50% align:center
We'll drive till we
hit the spatial rift.

00:03:13.735 --> 00:03:15.862 position:50% align:center
Well, keep an eye out
for bandits on the road.

00:03:15.945 --> 00:03:19.616 position:50% align:center
Also, there's a strange gas
that comes up from the ground.

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:20.950 position:50% align:center
A gas?

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:22.285 position:50% align:center
Looks like we're
gonna be drivin'

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:24.496 position:50% align:center
pretty far inland, doesn't it?

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.790 position:50% align:center
Why does the land look like
it got cut out and moved?

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:28.208 position:50% align:center
[whistle blows]

00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:30.126 position:50% align:center
Okay, Juggernaut.
You lead the way.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.253 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT]
Oh. Yes, sir!

00:03:32.337 --> 00:03:34.422 position:50% align:center
Sorry, Ma. Sorry, Pa.

00:03:34.506 --> 00:03:37.133 position:50% align:center
I sure do wish I could help ya
hunt down your tater thief,

00:03:37.217 --> 00:03:39.094 position:50% align:center
but I gotta get
back to work now.

00:03:39.177 --> 00:03:40.595 position:50% align:center
Never you mind that.

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:43.932 position:50% align:center
It's plain to see you got
more important things to handle.

00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:48.144 position:50% align:center
Just work hard and do us proud,
Takeru. And don't fall behind.

00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:49.145 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT]
Yes, ma'am!

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:52.107 position:50% align:center
I'm a Fire Soldier! I got this.

00:03:53.775 --> 00:03:55.151 position:50% align:center
Finish up your goodbyes!

00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:56.653 position:50% align:center
Come back 'n see us soon!

a pretty wife with ya.

Oh, jeez, Ma! You can't just--

00:04:02.033 --> 00:04:05.870 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] We're about to uncover
the secrets of the Evangelist.

You know, I warned them

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:54.229 position:50% align:center
that the air would
get to their heads.

00:05:54.312 --> 00:05:55.814 position:50% align:center

Yeah!

00:06:02.028 --> 00:06:04.364 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Why didn't they
put on gas masks?

00:06:04.447 --> 00:06:06.783 position:50% align:center
It's almost like they
wanted to inhale

00:06:06.866 --> 00:06:09.369 position:50% align:center
copious amounts of
a euphoric stimulant.

00:06:09.452 --> 00:06:11.413 position:50% align:center

Hell yeah!

00:06:11.496 --> 00:06:14.290 position:50% align:center

Hello? Mama?

Here's the thing. I'm not
gonna make it home tonight.

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:24.592 position:50% align:center
Huh? Where am I gonna stay then?
I can't tell--it's a secret!

00:06:24.676 --> 00:06:27.053 position:50% align:center
Hold up, I'm on the
Chinese Peninsula!

00:06:27.137 --> 00:06:29.222 position:50% align:center
No way is that phone
call getting through!

00:06:29.305 --> 00:06:30.849 position:50% align:center
Let's go! It's hot!

00:06:30.932 --> 00:06:33.643 position:50% align:center
And when it's hot,
I gotta dance!

00:06:33.727 --> 00:06:37.230 position:50% align:center
I have cleared my mind,
and thus, I am cool.

Aha! Hostile rocks sighted!

00:06:39.858 --> 00:06:41.943 position:50% align:center

we've got this.

Yeah!

00:06:52.495 --> 00:06:53.705 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Interesting.

00:06:53.788 --> 00:06:55.290 position:50% align:center
You can actually
see where the gases

00:06:55.373 --> 00:06:57.375 position:50% align:center
are coming up from the ground.

00:06:57.459 --> 00:06:59.044 position:50% align:center
Hey, Lieutenant Pan?

00:06:59.127 --> 00:07:01.463 position:50% align:center
You do remember what we
came here to do, right?

00:07:01.546 --> 00:07:04.257 position:50% align:center
We're here to identify the
cause of the Great Cataclysm

00:07:04.341 --> 00:07:06.217 position:50% align:center
that occurred 200 years ago.

00:07:06.301 --> 00:07:08.094 position:50% align:center
And learn what we can
about Adolla Bursts

00:07:08.178 --> 00:07:09.512 position:50% align:center
around the spatial rift.

00:07:09.596 --> 00:07:11.222 position:50% align:center
Duh.

00:07:11.306 --> 00:07:13.350 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] At least we're
clear about that much.

00:07:13.433 --> 00:07:15.352 position:50% align:center
Why wouldn't we be?

[whistle blows]

00:07:16.561 --> 00:07:17.979 position:50% align:center
All right, you brats!

00:07:18.063 --> 00:07:21.107 position:50% align:center
Stop with the horseplay and
behave yourselves, or else!

00:07:21.191 --> 00:07:23.485 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
All right, Instructor Pan.

00:07:23.568 --> 00:07:25.987 position:50% align:center
Hang on, where are
we going again?

00:07:26.071 --> 00:07:28.823 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Our destination
is west-northwest of here.

00:07:28.907 --> 00:07:32.285 position:50% align:center
We measured a great deal of
Adolla Burst activity there.

00:07:32.369 --> 00:07:34.871 position:50% align:center
We have a lengthy
road-trip ahead of us,

00:07:34.954 --> 00:07:37.791 position:50% align:center
so don't use up all your
energy goofing around.

00:07:37.874 --> 00:07:40.919 position:50% align:center
I was hoping we'd
get there soon.

00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:45.548 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] We're trying to find
out if and how Adolla Bursts

00:07:45.632 --> 00:07:47.967 position:50% align:center
are related to the
Great Cataclysm.

00:07:48.051 --> 00:07:52.263 position:50% align:center
If we're lucky, this info could
lead us to the Evangelist.

00:07:52.347 --> 00:07:53.264 position:50% align:center
What the--?

00:07:53.348 --> 00:07:55.308 position:50% align:center
Hey, guys, this
might sound weird,

00:07:55.392 --> 00:07:57.727 position:50% align:center
but I feel like that rock
might be staring at us.

00:07:57.811 --> 00:08:00.063 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Aww, is it scaring you?

00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:02.023 position:50% align:center
I hope it eats you first.

00:08:02.107 --> 00:08:05.276 position:50% align:center
[OGUN] The shape's too regular
to be caused by erosion.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.153 position:50% align:center
Normal rocks don't
look like that.

00:08:07.237 --> 00:08:09.239 position:50% align:center
Not unless someone
carves them up.

00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:11.366 position:50% align:center
Wonder if that shape
got seared into it

00:08:11.449 --> 00:08:12.951 position:50% align:center
during the Great Cataclysm.

00:08:13.034 --> 00:08:16.037 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT] It's okay, Tamaki.
It scares me, too.

00:08:16.121 --> 00:08:18.540 position:50% align:center
[ARTHUR]
My mind is too clear. I'm cold.

00:08:18.623 --> 00:08:20.125 position:50% align:center
Put a sock in it.

00:08:20.208 --> 00:08:23.253 position:50% align:center

00:08:50.864 --> 00:08:53.575 position:50% align:center

Wrong! It was me!

Yup. That's the gist of it.

much food out here,

you had to resort to stealing.

00:14:18.733 --> 00:14:20.777 position:50% align:center

00:15:45.737 --> 00:15:48.448 position:50% align:center
One wrong step and
you'll fall in the lava.

00:15:48.531 --> 00:15:50.533 position:50% align:center
Just leave them be.

00:15:51.534 --> 00:15:53.703 position:50% align:center
I still don't understand
what you are.

00:15:53.787 --> 00:15:55.830 position:50% align:center
[YATA]
Honestly, neither do I.

00:15:55.914 --> 00:15:57.832 position:50% align:center
My friends and I never
cared to think about it

00:15:57.916 --> 00:15:59.626 position:50% align:center
until we encountered
humans like you

00:15:59.709 --> 00:16:02.962 position:50% align:center
and learned our intelligence
was abnormal.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:12.347 position:50% align:center
Each light is a person in pain.

00:16:14.683 --> 00:16:16.643 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] These aren't
the only ones, either.

00:16:16.726 --> 00:16:18.520 position:50% align:center
There are others just like them,

00:16:18.603 --> 00:16:21.898 position:50% align:center
endlessly burning,
all over the world.

00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:24.734 position:50% align:center
And each one is another reason
that we have to find the truth

00:16:24.818 --> 00:16:27.946 position:50% align:center
about Adolla and
the Great Cataclysm.

00:16:28.029 --> 00:16:29.823 position:50% align:center
I'll go and find Tamaki.

00:16:29.906 --> 00:16:32.575 position:50% align:center
For now, she can pray for them.

00:16:42.502 --> 00:16:44.379 position:50% align:center
We've almost reached the oasis.

00:16:44.462 --> 00:16:47.799 position:50% align:center
You had a quiet trip thanks to
the directions we've given ya.

00:16:47.882 --> 00:16:50.635 position:50% align:center
Hopefully, this means you're
starting to trust us a little.

00:16:50.719 --> 00:16:52.262 position:50% align:center
I guess that's one
way to put it.

00:16:52.345 --> 00:16:55.181 position:50% align:center
There's just too much we don't
know about this region.

00:16:55.265 --> 00:16:59.060 position:50% align:center
So we'll take any helping hand,
or claw, that's offered.

00:16:59.144 --> 00:17:00.729 position:50% align:center
[SCOP] Once we reach
the top of that crag,

00:17:00.812 --> 00:17:02.731 position:50% align:center
we'll have a view
of the whole oasis.

00:17:02.814 --> 00:17:03.982 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT]
Aww...

00:17:04.065 --> 00:17:05.984 position:50% align:center
We have to climb this thing?

00:17:06.067 --> 00:17:08.028 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
I don't feel like I can.

00:17:08.111 --> 00:17:10.030 position:50% align:center
[YATA]
I'll go assess the situation.

00:17:10.113 --> 00:17:11.531 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
I'll head up there with him.

00:17:11.614 --> 00:17:13.241 position:50% align:center
[PAN]
Be careful.

00:17:14.325 --> 00:17:15.744 position:50% align:center
'Kay. Let's do this.

00:17:15.827 --> 00:17:18.329 position:50% align:center
I've never met a human
who could fly before.

00:17:18.413 --> 00:17:20.582 position:50% align:center
Hey. You with the
mask and the hair.

00:17:20.665 --> 00:17:22.292 position:50% align:center
Now that we're this
close to the oasis,

00:17:22.375 --> 00:17:24.336 position:50% align:center
you don't have to
worry about the gas.

00:17:24.419 --> 00:17:25.670 position:50% align:center
[LICHT]
Really?

00:17:27.589 --> 00:17:30.050 position:50% align:center
You're right. The air's
perfectly fine here.

00:17:30.133 --> 00:17:31.384 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT]
If there really is water here,

00:17:31.468 --> 00:17:33.345 position:50% align:center
this would be a great
spot to grow potatoes.

00:17:33.428 --> 00:17:35.013 position:50% align:center
[SCOP] Your big on
the tates, aren't ya?

00:17:35.096 --> 00:17:38.266 position:50% align:center
Y'know, the air doesn't feel
as dry as it did on the road.

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:39.768 position:50% align:center
[YATA]
We need to move quietly.

00:17:39.851 --> 00:17:40.977 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Not a problem.

00:17:41.061 --> 00:17:42.687 position:50% align:center
[YATA] We'll scout the
place out from here.

00:17:42.771 --> 00:17:44.439 position:50% align:center
Keep your head down.

00:17:47.984 --> 00:17:51.071 position:50% align:center
Amazing. There really
are plants growing here.

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:54.199 position:50% align:center
It's the Tabernacle
that gives it life.

00:17:54.282 --> 00:17:55.658 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Tabernacle?

00:17:55.742 --> 00:17:57.410 position:50% align:center
You can see it
over there, right?

00:17:57.494 --> 00:17:59.287 position:50% align:center
Well, what does it look like?

00:17:59.371 --> 00:18:00.455 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:00.538 --> 00:18:01.790 position:50% align:center
How the hell

00:18:01.873 --> 00:18:03.833 position:50% align:center
--did that get here?
--Hey, get down, you idiot.

00:18:03.917 --> 00:18:06.586 position:50% align:center
You recognize the Tabernacle?

00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:08.672 position:50% align:center
Yeah, of course I do.

00:18:08.755 --> 00:18:12.550 position:50% align:center
It's the keystone of
the Tokyo Empire.

00:18:12.634 --> 00:18:15.762 position:50% align:center
It's Amaterasu. It must be.

00:18:15.845 --> 00:18:18.098 position:50% align:center
But how did it get here?

00:18:18.181 --> 00:18:19.557 position:50% align:center
This doesn't make sense.

00:18:19.641 --> 00:18:20.433 position:50% align:center
[YATA]
Get down!

00:18:20.517 --> 00:18:23.019 position:50% align:center
We don't need to draw attention.

00:18:23.103 --> 00:18:24.396 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Wait...

00:18:24.479 --> 00:18:27.816 position:50% align:center
I thought Amaterasu was
built by Vulcan's ancestors.

00:18:27.899 --> 00:18:30.026 position:50% align:center
Shinra's assessment is dead on.

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:32.904 position:50% align:center
That's a small, weathered
version of Amaterasu.

00:18:32.987 --> 00:18:34.739 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI] Is it another
perpetual generator?

00:18:34.823 --> 00:18:36.157 position:50% align:center
[OGUN]
Even if not,

00:18:36.241 --> 00:18:39.703 position:50% align:center
what's an Amaterasu look-a-
like doin' way out here?

00:18:39.786 --> 00:18:41.788 position:50% align:center
We'll just have to
check it out in person.

00:18:41.871 --> 00:18:44.624 position:50% align:center
The Tabernacle is right in
the middle of the oasis.

00:18:44.708 --> 00:18:47.252 position:50% align:center
Follow me and I'll
show you the way.

00:18:51.756 --> 00:18:54.509 position:50% align:center
[JUGGERNAUT] I'm noticing
a lot of manmade objects.

00:18:54.592 --> 00:18:56.761 position:50% align:center
[OGUN]
Yeah. Peep that one.

00:18:56.845 --> 00:19:00.098 position:50% align:center
A lot of this stuff is from
before the Great Cataclysm.

00:19:00.181 --> 00:19:02.976 position:50% align:center
All the trees out here seem
to be in really good health.

00:19:03.059 --> 00:19:06.730 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] The Tabernacle is just
a bit northwest of here.

00:19:06.813 --> 00:19:10.316 position:50% align:center
Hey, so if this "Tabernacle" of
theirs is related to Amaterasu,

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:13.611 position:50% align:center
then it's probably powered by an
Adolla Burst, don't you think?

00:19:13.695 --> 00:19:15.613 position:50% align:center
And that means it's because
of an Adolla Burst

00:19:15.697 --> 00:19:17.073 position:50% align:center
that the forest grew back.

00:19:17.157 --> 00:19:19.034 position:50% align:center
Think Vulcan's family
came through?

00:19:19.117 --> 00:19:21.411 position:50% align:center
They built Amaterasu,
didn't they?

00:19:21.494 --> 00:19:23.872 position:50% align:center
[LICHT] Uh, the official story
is that the Holy Sol Temple

00:19:23.955 --> 00:19:26.041 position:50% align:center
designed it with the help
of Vulcan's ancestors,

00:19:26.124 --> 00:19:29.627 position:50% align:center
but if this Tabernacle was
built before Amaterasu,

00:19:29.711 --> 00:19:31.838 position:50% align:center
that probably isn't true.

00:19:31.921 --> 00:19:34.883 position:50% align:center
You think Amaterasu was
based offa this place?

00:19:34.966 --> 00:19:37.886 position:50% align:center
Well, either way, it's cool
to see that this much life

00:19:37.969 --> 00:19:39.763 position:50% align:center
was created by an Adolla Burst.

00:19:39.846 --> 00:19:41.931 position:50% align:center
It feels like proof that
these flames have the power

00:19:42.015 --> 00:19:43.641 position:50% align:center
to help restore the world.

00:19:43.725 --> 00:19:45.143 position:50% align:center
Amazing.

00:19:45.226 --> 00:19:47.854 position:50% align:center
It's no wonder Adolla Bursts
are considered sacred, huh?

00:19:47.937 --> 00:19:50.523 position:50% align:center
Flipside: There's a pretty good
chance that they're what

00:19:50.607 --> 00:19:52.400 position:50% align:center
wrecked this world
in the first place.

00:19:52.484 --> 00:19:53.943 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:19:54.027 --> 00:19:57.405 position:50% align:center
We should hit the middle of
the oasis any minute now.

00:19:58.948 --> 00:19:59.991 position:50% align:center
Hold up.

00:20:00.075 --> 00:20:01.993 position:50% align:center
We made it to one
of the pillars, see?

00:20:02.077 --> 00:20:03.036 position:50% align:center
There are more just like it

00:20:03.119 --> 00:20:04.996 position:50% align:center
all around the
Tabernacle's perimeter.

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:07.749 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] That means we're
really close, right?

00:20:07.832 --> 00:20:09.084 position:50% align:center
[SCOP]
Yeah, but it also means,

00:20:09.167 --> 00:20:11.586 position:50% align:center
soon you'll meet the jerks
who ran me outta here.

00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:13.129 position:50% align:center

We came to investigate.

00:20:13.213 --> 00:20:15.006 position:50% align:center
I don't wanna fight
if we can avoid it.

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:16.633 position:50% align:center
Well, if you're hopin'
they'll negotiate,

00:20:16.716 --> 00:20:17.634 position:50% align:center
you'll be disappointed.

00:20:17.717 --> 00:20:18.885 position:50% align:center

He's right.

00:20:18.968 --> 00:20:22.055 position:50% align:center
These invaders have no
interest in diplomacy.

00:20:23.056 --> 00:20:25.892 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, Lieutenant,
but we can't turn back.

00:20:25.975 --> 00:20:27.143 position:50% align:center
We're closing in on the mystery

00:20:27.227 --> 00:20:29.646 position:50% align:center
behind spontaneous
human combustion

00:20:29.729 --> 00:20:34.401 position:50% align:center
Even if Scop is right and these
guys are unwilling to negotiate,

00:20:34.484 --> 00:20:36.986 position:50% align:center
that just means we should
be ready to fight them.

Yeah, that's the spirit!
This guy's my hero!

far to give up now.
