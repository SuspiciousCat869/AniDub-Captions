00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:26.693 position:50% align:center
Seems it was caused

Unfortunately,
there's been a casualty.

00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:30.030 position:50% align:center

Make sure that you're
prepared, Sister.

[SHINRA]
Either I'm misreading something,

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:59.202 position:50% align:center
or the scriptures are incorrect
on several major points.

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:01.746 position:50% align:center
The Holy Sol Temple might have
some secret connection

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.790 position:50% align:center
to the Evangelist.

00:02:07.043 --> 00:02:09.754 position:50% align:center
I can't dwell on
worldly matters.

00:03:47.102 --> 00:03:48.520 position:50% align:center
[OBI]
Okay.

00:03:48.603 --> 00:03:50.480 position:50% align:center
Those flechettes, as well?

00:03:50.563 --> 00:03:53.108 position:50% align:center
Correct, sir.
And that's all of it.

00:03:53.191 --> 00:03:55.694 position:50% align:center
I guess we've had a lot
of callouts lately,

00:03:55.777 --> 00:03:59.072 position:50% align:center
which means we're behind
on baptizing the gear.

00:03:59.155 --> 00:04:01.991 position:50% align:center
But the Sister can't carry
all of this by herself.

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:03.326 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:04.869 position:50% align:center
You want me to go with her
to the Central Church

00:04:04.953 --> 00:04:06.413 position:50% align:center
to baptize our equipment?

00:04:06.496 --> 00:04:09.541 position:50% align:center
[OBI] Yeah. It's also called
the Baptism Church.

00:04:09.624 --> 00:04:11.793 position:50% align:center
You've never been there
before, have you?

00:04:11.876 --> 00:04:13.128 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
No, sir.

00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:15.547 position:50% align:center
[OBI] All the gear we need
baptized is in there.

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.090 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Got it, sir.

00:04:17.173 --> 00:04:19.676 position:50% align:center
[IRIS] Excuse me.
I'm ready to go when you are.

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:20.927 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Looking forward to it!

00:04:21.011 --> 00:04:24.806 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Let's go
rock n' roll! Yay!

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:27.934 position:50% align:center
Too freakin' cute!

00:04:28.018 --> 00:04:29.936 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
I'm going on a date.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.272 position:50% align:center
A church date with Sister Iris.

00:04:32.355 --> 00:04:33.898 position:50% align:center
[IRIS] That stuff isn't
too heavy, is it?

00:04:33.982 --> 00:04:35.984 position:50% align:center
Nope, not for me!

00:04:36.067 --> 00:04:38.278 position:50% align:center
Must be tough doing
this alone, huh?

00:04:38.361 --> 00:04:41.156 position:50% align:center
[IRIS] There usually isn't
this much to carry.

00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:45.744 position:50% align:center
I need to start hitting the gym

00:04:45.827 --> 00:04:47.537 position:50% align:center
so the rest of you
don't show me up.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.124 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Her skin is like
cream and so supple.

00:04:51.207 --> 00:04:55.128 position:50% align:center
No! This is wrong.
I can't look at her like this!

00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:59.299 position:50% align:center
It's not just off limits,
that Power Cobra is forbidden!

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:05.930 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] So this is the
Baptism Church, huh?

00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:12.395 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow. Is all this
water used for baptisms?

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.731 position:50% align:center
It'll take a little time
for me to finish,

00:05:14.814 --> 00:05:17.233 position:50% align:center
so feel free to have a
look around the church.

00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:19.903 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Okay. I'll see you in a bit.

00:05:22.947 --> 00:05:24.699 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA sighs]

00:05:24.783 --> 00:05:26.743 position:50% align:center
I guess there's not gonna
be any time for a stroll

00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:28.328 position:50% align:center
with the Sister.

00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:31.581 position:50% align:center
What did I expect? This is work.

00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.960 position:50% align:center
This place is really beautiful.

00:05:36.044 --> 00:05:39.881 position:50% align:center
But it still has the stain
of the Evangelist on it.

00:05:39.964 --> 00:05:43.259 position:50% align:center
Sister Iris is acting
as cheerful as usual,

00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:47.806 position:50% align:center
but there's a sadness
inside her smile.

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:49.307 position:50% align:center
If something's bothering her,

00:05:49.391 --> 00:05:52.852 position:50% align:center
I'd be happy to help her
out in any way I can.

00:05:52.936 --> 00:05:54.521 position:50% align:center
O merciful and hallowed Lord

00:05:54.604 --> 00:05:56.648 position:50% align:center
who shineth brightly
in the heavens,

00:05:56.731 --> 00:06:00.235 position:50% align:center
may those that reach thy
presence receive thy blessing...

00:06:00.318 --> 00:06:02.779 position:50% align:center
[IRIS] If the Holy Sol Temple
was originally founded

00:06:02.862 --> 00:06:07.492 position:50% align:center
by the Evangelist, then who
exactly am I praying to?

00:06:07.575 --> 00:06:11.079 position:50% align:center
Sister Iris.
Something's distracting you.

00:06:11.162 --> 00:06:12.706 position:50% align:center
[IRIS]
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:15.000 position:50% align:center
Please grant the blessing
of thy baptism to all--

00:06:15.083 --> 00:06:17.085 position:50% align:center
These grounds are
really something else.

00:06:17.168 --> 00:06:19.754 position:50% align:center
[LI] Well, if it isn't
Kusakabe from the 8th.

00:06:19.838 --> 00:06:22.424 position:50% align:center
Hello, Lieutenant!
It's good to see you!

00:06:22.507 --> 00:06:24.134 position:50% align:center
I didn't expect to
run into you here.

00:06:24.217 --> 00:06:25.510 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:30.098 position:50% align:center
I'm just helping get some
of our equipment baptized.

00:06:30.181 --> 00:06:31.182 position:50% align:center
[LI]
I'm glad to hear the 8th

00:06:31.266 --> 00:06:33.143 position:50% align:center
is still committed
to such practices.

00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:34.853 position:50% align:center
What do you mean by that?

00:06:34.936 --> 00:06:37.022 position:50% align:center
Surely you've heard
the rumors by now.

00:06:37.105 --> 00:06:39.649 position:50% align:center
About the Temple
and the Evangelist.

00:06:39.733 --> 00:06:41.067 position:50% align:center
Well, unfortunately,

00:06:41.151 --> 00:06:43.820 position:50% align:center
it's led to some units
neglecting their sacred rites.

00:06:43.903 --> 00:06:44.779 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:44.863 --> 00:06:46.573 position:50% align:center
Karim, for example.

00:06:46.656 --> 00:06:50.827 position:50% align:center
It's not hard to tell, his faith
is definitely being tested.

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:53.621 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Is that what's
bothering the Sister?

00:06:53.705 --> 00:06:55.498 position:50% align:center
I'd like to know your
thoughts, Lieutenant.

00:06:55.582 --> 00:06:56.750 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:59.836 --> 00:07:01.963 position:50% align:center
[LI] I'll admit, when I heard
the Holy Sol Temple

00:07:02.047 --> 00:07:05.884 position:50% align:center
may have been founded by the
Evangelist, I was shocked.

00:07:05.967 --> 00:07:09.763 position:50% align:center
However, the Temple exalts the
glory of the Sun and its fire,

00:07:09.846 --> 00:07:11.264 position:50% align:center
not the Evangelist.

00:07:11.348 --> 00:07:12.891 position:50% align:center
I've worshipped
the Sun all my life,

00:07:12.974 --> 00:07:16.519 position:50% align:center
and as long as it remains,
so will my faith.

00:07:16.603 --> 00:07:19.773 position:50% align:center
On the other hand, I've had
a startling revelation.

00:07:19.856 --> 00:07:21.900 position:50% align:center
If the Evangelist
was simply a fraud,

00:07:21.983 --> 00:07:24.319 position:50% align:center
she'd be enriching herself
and setting herself up

00:07:24.402 --> 00:07:26.529 position:50% align:center
to be worshipped by the masses.

00:07:26.613 --> 00:07:27.906 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:27.989 --> 00:07:29.741 position:50% align:center
That's true.

00:07:29.824 --> 00:07:31.159 position:50% align:center
[LI]
But the reality is,

00:07:31.242 --> 00:07:34.996 position:50% align:center
the Evangelist lurks in
the shadows, out of sight.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.874 position:50% align:center
So that gives some
credence to what's said

00:07:37.957 --> 00:07:40.919 position:50% align:center
to be her ultimate goal:
The end of the world.

00:07:41.002 --> 00:07:43.880 position:50% align:center
You're saying our
faith's dangerous?

00:07:48.343 --> 00:07:51.680 position:50% align:center
[LI]
Faith is crucial.

00:07:51.763 --> 00:07:54.432 position:50% align:center
People need to believe
in something.

00:07:57.143 --> 00:07:58.561 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Tell me, Lieutenant.

00:07:58.645 --> 00:08:00.021 position:50% align:center
Was it your faith
that spurred you

00:08:00.105 --> 00:08:03.274 position:50% align:center
to protect Lieutenant Karim
without a second thought?

00:08:06.277 --> 00:08:07.904 position:50% align:center
[LI]
I suppose it was.

00:08:07.987 --> 00:08:10.532 position:50% align:center
I strongly believe in
the Holy Sol Temple,

00:08:10.615 --> 00:08:13.368 position:50% align:center
as well as in Lieutenant Karim.

00:08:13.451 --> 00:08:19.082 position:50% align:center
Losing something or someone
so dear is devastating.

00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:21.209 position:50% align:center
If you have the
power to believe,

00:08:21.292 --> 00:08:23.294 position:50% align:center
you can save your friends.

00:08:23.378 --> 00:08:26.715 position:50% align:center
Having the power to believe.

00:08:26.798 --> 00:08:28.550 position:50% align:center
That'll be your duty now...

00:08:28.633 --> 00:08:30.719 position:50% align:center
Remember, no matter
what goes down here,

00:08:30.802 --> 00:08:32.012 position:50% align:center
Asakusa is your town.

00:08:32.095 --> 00:08:34.723 position:50% align:center
The people aren't waiting
for me. It's Beni...

00:08:34.806 --> 00:08:36.766 position:50% align:center
As Soldiers, you
should understand.

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:38.685 position:50% align:center
This life of mine
isn't worth much,

00:08:38.768 --> 00:08:41.980 position:50% align:center
so if I can help Waka,
I'll put it on the line.

00:08:42.063 --> 00:08:44.024 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
The 7th has that power

00:08:44.107 --> 00:08:47.277 position:50% align:center
because their strength
comes from their hearts.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:51.281 position:50% align:center
But if you lose the
things you believe in...

00:08:51.364 --> 00:08:53.658 position:50% align:center
Apologies for making you wait.

00:08:53.742 --> 00:08:57.037 position:50% align:center
I was a little distracted
and Sister scolded me for it.

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.582 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Oh, it's okay.
Happens to everyone.

00:09:00.665 --> 00:09:04.002 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] So even she's
shaken up by all this.

00:09:04.085 --> 00:09:05.211 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Well, wanna head back?

00:09:05.295 --> 00:09:07.047 position:50% align:center
Oh, I, uh--

00:09:08.173 --> 00:09:11.968 position:50% align:center
I have a quick little stop that
I'd like to make on the way.

00:09:13.762 --> 00:09:14.846 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
This place.

00:09:14.929 --> 00:09:16.973 position:50% align:center
[IRIS] Yes, the National
Holy Sol Cemetery

00:09:17.057 --> 00:09:18.767 position:50% align:center
is where the clergy get buried.

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:20.352 position:50% align:center
Whoa.

00:09:20.435 --> 00:09:24.606 position:50% align:center
I always stop by here after
I'm done with the baptisms.

00:09:24.689 --> 00:09:27.859 position:50% align:center
It's mainly to visit the shrine
of the Sisters from the convent

00:09:27.942 --> 00:09:30.195 position:50% align:center
where I grew up.

00:09:30.278 --> 00:09:33.365 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Wow! Look at all the sunflowers!

00:09:33.448 --> 00:09:36.951 position:50% align:center
[IRIS] Aren't they wonderful?
They bloom facing the sun.

00:09:37.035 --> 00:09:37.786 position:50% align:center
You see?

00:09:37.869 --> 00:09:39.079 position:50% align:center
They're planted near shrines

00:09:39.162 --> 00:09:40.955 position:50% align:center
so the dead can find
the way to the Sun.

00:09:41.039 --> 00:09:43.208 position:50% align:center
To guide their spirits.

00:09:45.251 --> 00:09:48.254 position:50% align:center
[IRIS] Here, do you mind
praying with me?

00:09:48.338 --> 00:09:50.298 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Not at all!

00:09:52.133 --> 00:09:53.468 position:50% align:center
[IRIS grunts]

00:09:56.137 --> 00:09:58.056 position:50% align:center
Well, that's a pretty
flashy shrine.

00:09:58.139 --> 00:10:01.059 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid that would
be Hibana's doing.

00:10:01.142 --> 00:10:03.019 position:50% align:center
How can the dead
rest with all this?

00:10:03.103 --> 00:10:05.188 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't have expected her.

00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:07.023 position:50% align:center
These flowers are still fresh.

00:10:07.107 --> 00:10:09.150 position:50% align:center
Looks like she just
came by recently.

00:10:09.234 --> 00:10:10.735 position:50% align:center
Surprising as it may seem,

00:10:10.819 --> 00:10:14.030 position:50% align:center
she truly did love everyone
from the convent.

00:10:14.114 --> 00:10:16.908 position:50% align:center
She comes here to
visit quite frequently.

00:10:16.991 --> 00:10:19.744 position:50% align:center
But subtlety is not her forte.

00:10:21.705 --> 00:10:23.540 position:50% align:center
[IRIS]
I hope you're all doing well.

00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:27.627 position:50% align:center
Sister Clematis, please
remember to not overindulge.

00:10:27.711 --> 00:10:31.464 position:50% align:center
And Sister Sakura,
try not to stay up too late.

00:10:31.548 --> 00:10:32.632 position:50% align:center
Next time I'll come see you

00:10:32.716 --> 00:10:35.802 position:50% align:center
before Hibana does
her razzle-dazzle.

00:10:37.387 --> 00:10:38.805 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Sister Iris?

00:10:38.888 --> 00:10:40.557 position:50% align:center
[IRIS]
Uh. Yes?

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.351 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] I hope I'm
not outta line here...

00:10:44.686 --> 00:10:46.438 position:50% align:center
But if there's
anything troubling you,

00:10:46.521 --> 00:10:49.274 position:50% align:center
I'd be more than happy to help.

00:10:49.357 --> 00:10:51.776 position:50% align:center
I mean, it's the
Evangelist, right?

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:54.195 position:50% align:center
My goodness, is it
really that obvious?

00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:56.573 position:50% align:center
I guess hiding things
isn't my forte.

00:10:56.656 --> 00:10:59.200 position:50% align:center
You're good at always
pushing Vulcan's buttons.

00:10:59.284 --> 00:11:01.369 position:50% align:center
Cutting to the chase
on what you want.

00:11:01.453 --> 00:11:04.622 position:50% align:center
I'd never accuse you
of being hard to read.

00:11:04.706 --> 00:11:07.792 position:50% align:center
Uh, but hear me out! I'm not
saying that's a bad thing!

00:11:07.876 --> 00:11:12.088 position:50% align:center
You're honest and sincere.
People love that about you!

00:11:13.548 --> 00:11:18.511 position:50% align:center
[IRIS] Shinra, what do you think
about the Holy Sol Temple?

00:11:18.595 --> 00:11:21.056 position:50% align:center
And those of us who
strongly believe in it?

00:11:21.139 --> 00:11:22.182 position:50% align:center
The people like me?

00:11:22.265 --> 00:11:23.475 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:23.558 --> 00:11:24.184 position:50% align:center
What do I--?

00:11:24.267 --> 00:11:25.727 position:50% align:center
[SISTER B screams]

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:27.979 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
What's that?

00:11:28.063 --> 00:11:30.482 position:50% align:center
Father, no.

00:11:30.565 --> 00:11:31.983 position:50% align:center
[IRIS]
What happened?

00:11:32.067 --> 00:11:35.111 position:50% align:center
[SISTER B]
Father. All of a sudden, he--

00:11:35.195 --> 00:11:37.447 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
An Infernal.

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:38.823 position:50% align:center
But how?

00:11:38.907 --> 00:11:41.951 position:50% align:center
He's so steadfast in his faith.
He's always in prayer.

00:11:42.035 --> 00:11:46.081 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] I'll take care of him.
Please, keep back!

00:11:49.209 --> 00:11:52.253 position:50% align:center
[roars]

00:11:53.338 --> 00:11:55.006 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Sister! The prayer!

00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:56.383 position:50% align:center
[IRIS]
Right, of course!

00:11:56.466 --> 00:11:59.552 position:50% align:center
Um. The flame is
the soul's breath.

00:11:59.636 --> 00:12:02.639 position:50% align:center
The black smoke is
the soul's release.

00:12:02.722 --> 00:12:06.351 position:50% align:center
Ashes thou wert and art.
May thy soul return...

00:12:11.481 --> 00:12:16.361 position:50% align:center
Return to the great
flame... of fire!

00:12:22.575 --> 00:12:23.576 position:50% align:center
<i>Látom.</i>

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:25.453 position:50% align:center
[SISTER B crying]

00:12:25.537 --> 00:12:27.997 position:50% align:center
[SISTER B]
Oh, Father! Why?

00:12:28.081 --> 00:12:29.874 position:50% align:center
Why did this happen?

00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.210 position:50% align:center
He offered up his prayers
and devotions to God

00:12:32.293 --> 00:12:34.045 position:50% align:center
every day without fail.

00:12:34.129 --> 00:12:37.090 position:50% align:center
But in the end it still
didn't do him any good!

00:12:37.173 --> 00:12:39.092 position:50% align:center
Sister.

00:12:39.175 --> 00:12:41.970 position:50% align:center
Does God not have any mercy?

00:12:45.724 --> 00:12:47.308 position:50% align:center
[FATHER A]
<i>Látom.</i>

00:12:49.853 --> 00:12:53.314 position:50% align:center
[FATHER A] What a blessing there
was a Fire Soldier here to help.

00:12:53.398 --> 00:12:54.566 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Well, I--

00:12:54.649 --> 00:12:56.484 position:50% align:center
[SISTER B] The Father
was such a devout man.

00:12:56.568 --> 00:12:58.445 position:50% align:center
What good did
praying do for him?

00:12:58.528 --> 00:13:01.114 position:50% align:center
Was God even listening to him?

00:13:04.701 --> 00:13:07.746 position:50% align:center
[IRIS] Earlier we were
discussing something.

00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:11.458 position:50% align:center
If the Evangelist did indeed
create the Holy Sol Temple,

00:13:11.541 --> 00:13:13.585 position:50% align:center
does that mean the
God we worship...

00:13:13.668 --> 00:13:16.713 position:50% align:center
Are we all just praying
to the Evangelist?

00:13:16.796 --> 00:13:18.923 position:50% align:center
The Evangelist?

00:13:20.884 --> 00:13:23.762 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] An inhuman being
beyond our comprehension.

00:13:23.845 --> 00:13:26.598 position:50% align:center
That's what I felt during
that Adolla Link we shared.

00:13:26.681 --> 00:13:29.517 position:50% align:center
That she was something
from a whole other world.

00:13:29.601 --> 00:13:31.644 position:50% align:center
Honestly, it's not
all that different

00:13:31.728 --> 00:13:33.980 position:50% align:center
than how we might picture
God in our minds.

00:13:34.064 --> 00:13:37.400 position:50% align:center
But this God wants
to destroy the world.

00:13:37.484 --> 00:13:39.903 position:50% align:center
She wants people
to suffer and die.

00:13:39.986 --> 00:13:41.571 position:50% align:center
Those of us in the clergy,

00:13:41.654 --> 00:13:46.201 position:50% align:center
if we just blindly put our
faith in her teachings...

00:13:46.284 --> 00:13:49.746 position:50% align:center
...then aren't we just leading
people to their deaths?

00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:52.499 position:50% align:center
No, you're not.

00:13:52.582 --> 00:13:54.042 position:50% align:center
I'm the one who kills.

00:13:54.125 --> 00:13:55.627 position:50% align:center
Shinra!

00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:58.463 position:50% align:center
You release those poor people
from the torment of the flames!

00:13:58.546 --> 00:14:02.092 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] Just now, we had no
choice but to end his suffering.

00:14:02.175 --> 00:14:03.843 position:50% align:center
I believe that.

00:14:03.927 --> 00:14:06.930 position:50% align:center
But I still feel my heart
throbbing in my chest

00:14:07.013 --> 00:14:10.517 position:50% align:center
and my feet clenching up.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.728 position:50% align:center
Captain Obi said
something to me once.

00:14:13.812 --> 00:14:15.563 position:50% align:center
He said, "The worst
thing this job can do

00:14:15.647 --> 00:14:18.191 position:50% align:center
is make you numb to it."

00:14:18.274 --> 00:14:20.443 position:50% align:center
I mean, I always hoped it
would get a little easier,

00:14:20.527 --> 00:14:23.488 position:50% align:center
but it didn't.

00:14:23.571 --> 00:14:24.906 position:50% align:center
It's still painful.

00:14:24.989 --> 00:14:28.201 position:50% align:center
And that's why we Fire
Soldiers need Sisters to help.

00:14:28.284 --> 00:14:31.204 position:50% align:center
I ran into Lieutenant
Li from the 1st.

00:14:31.287 --> 00:14:32.622 position:50% align:center
We talked about this.

00:14:32.706 --> 00:14:35.875 position:50% align:center
He told me that he only
worships the glory of the Sun.

00:14:35.959 --> 00:14:39.879 position:50% align:center
His faith is not tied in
any way to the Evangelist.

00:14:39.963 --> 00:14:41.965 position:50% align:center
Yes, that's true.

00:14:42.048 --> 00:14:46.094 position:50% align:center
You see? So don't let
this get you down.

00:14:48.888 --> 00:14:51.516 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Keep looking to the Sun.

00:14:51.599 --> 00:14:53.351 position:50% align:center
The rest of us
can keep fighting

00:14:53.435 --> 00:14:55.854 position:50% align:center
because you're guiding
us to the light.

00:14:55.937 --> 00:15:00.567 position:50% align:center
For all of us at the 8th,
you're like our sunflower.

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:05.864 position:50% align:center
Really? I'm the 8th's sunflower?

00:15:09.868 --> 00:15:11.411 position:50% align:center
[IRIS]
But I've always been an "Iris."

00:15:11.494 --> 00:15:14.414 position:50% align:center
Uh. Yeah, very funny.

00:15:16.124 --> 00:15:18.460 position:50% align:center
I really do appreciate that.

00:15:18.543 --> 00:15:21.671 position:50% align:center
It's sweet. Thanks, Shinra.

00:15:21.755 --> 00:15:25.091 position:50% align:center
But still, go easy
on yourself, okay?

00:15:25.175 --> 00:15:26.718 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:15:31.014 --> 00:15:33.391 position:50% align:center
[IRIS]
I think I'll be fine.

00:15:36.061 --> 00:15:37.687 position:50% align:center
Well done, Sister Iris.

00:15:37.771 --> 00:15:40.940 position:50% align:center
You offered up your
prayers beautifully.

00:15:41.024 --> 00:15:43.860 position:50% align:center
Thank you very much.

00:15:43.943 --> 00:15:45.487 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Okay.

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:47.072 position:50% align:center
[IRIS]
Do you need me to help?

00:15:47.155 --> 00:15:50.283 position:50% align:center
Oh, no. I'm supposed to handle
all the heavy lifting, right?

00:15:50.367 --> 00:15:52.911 position:50% align:center
I'd even carry you back
if you needed me to.

00:15:52.994 --> 00:15:54.621 position:50% align:center
'Cause I'm a macho man!

00:15:54.704 --> 00:15:55.997 position:50% align:center
Uh. I'd never make you!

00:15:56.081 --> 00:15:57.248 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA]
Well, I can handle it!

00:15:57.332 --> 00:15:58.875 position:50% align:center
Come hop on!

00:15:59.793 --> 00:16:01.336 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm on.

00:16:01.419 --> 00:16:02.921 position:50% align:center
Right, no sweat.

00:16:03.004 --> 00:16:04.089 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:16:04.172 --> 00:16:06.216 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA yells]

00:16:06.299 --> 00:16:07.467 position:50% align:center
[IRIS]
Are you okay?

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:09.010 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA] After carrying
all the captain's gear,

00:16:09.094 --> 00:16:11.012 position:50% align:center
this is a breeze!

00:16:12.138 --> 00:16:14.432 position:50% align:center
Hey, Shinra.

00:16:14.516 --> 00:16:16.851 position:50% align:center
Next time something's
on my mind,

00:16:16.935 --> 00:16:19.270 position:50% align:center
you'll be the first one
I talk to about it.

00:16:19.354 --> 00:16:21.815 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Sure thing.

00:16:21.898 --> 00:16:23.525 position:50% align:center
[SHINRA grunts]

00:16:26.986 --> 00:16:28.822 position:50% align:center
Definitely.

00:16:32.534 --> 00:16:35.286 position:50% align:center
[WHITE-CLAD C] What? His
training has been completed?

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:36.621 position:50% align:center
[WHITE-CLAD A]
Indeed.

00:16:36.705 --> 00:16:39.541 position:50% align:center
[WHITE-CLAD B] At last,
the time has finally come!

00:16:39.624 --> 00:16:42.085 position:50% align:center
[YONA]
The 8th doesn't stand a chance.

00:16:42.168 --> 00:16:45.255 position:50% align:center
The Bloody Incendiary
Round departs.

00:16:45.338 --> 00:16:49.092 position:50% align:center
Or should I say, sets off.

00:17:01.104 --> 00:17:03.898 position:50% align:center
[ASSAULT] During our clash
with the 8th in the Nether,

00:17:03.982 --> 00:17:06.443 position:50% align:center
I was sent in to be
the Exterminator.

00:17:06.526 --> 00:17:12.282 position:50% align:center
However, I ran into an
unforeseen assassin.

00:17:12.365 --> 00:17:14.117 position:50% align:center
Tamaki Kotatsu.

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.744 position:50% align:center
Her innocence is fake.

00:17:15.827 --> 00:17:18.747 position:50% align:center
It belies a terrifying
level of shamelessness.

00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:20.081 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:17:20.165 --> 00:17:21.750 position:50% align:center
[ASSAULT]
It makes me shiver.

00:17:21.833 --> 00:17:23.793 position:50% align:center
If I'm going to bring
down the 8th,

00:17:23.877 --> 00:17:27.005 position:50% align:center
she has to be my first target.

00:17:27.088 --> 00:17:29.549 position:50% align:center
My training has been crucial.

00:17:29.632 --> 00:17:34.679 position:50% align:center
Day in and day out, sunup
to sundown, I worked at it.

00:17:34.763 --> 00:17:38.016 position:50% align:center
All so I could resist that
damn lascivious woman!

00:17:38.099 --> 00:17:41.770 position:50% align:center
I pored over dirty
magazines and books.

00:17:41.853 --> 00:17:44.689 position:50% align:center
I even had adult videos
playing nonstop.

00:17:44.773 --> 00:17:48.568 position:50% align:center
I've seen every centimeter
of skin there is.

00:17:48.651 --> 00:17:51.946 position:50% align:center
I am now immune to
the female form.

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:56.951 position:50% align:center
You won't stop me, Tamaki
Kotatsu. Not this time!

00:18:01.456 --> 00:18:03.708 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
What is this?

00:18:03.792 --> 00:18:04.959 position:50% align:center
"You will meet me

00:18:05.043 --> 00:18:07.921 position:50% align:center
at the picturesque vacant
lot in two-chome."

00:18:08.004 --> 00:18:11.508 position:50% align:center
Wait, is this some
weird love letter?

00:18:11.591 --> 00:18:16.137 position:50% align:center
It's you. You're Assault!
The Bloody "something"!

00:18:16.221 --> 00:18:18.723 position:50% align:center
[ASSAULT] You're quite
brave to come here alone,

00:18:18.807 --> 00:18:19.808 position:50% align:center
Tamaki Kotatsu.

00:18:19.891 --> 00:18:21.393 position:50% align:center
But why are you here?

00:18:21.476 --> 00:18:25.271 position:50% align:center
Ha! Why waste time explaining
myself to one so close to death?

00:18:25.355 --> 00:18:26.106 position:50% align:center
Die!

00:18:26.189 --> 00:18:27.649 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:29.442 --> 00:18:32.737 position:50% align:center
[ASSAULT] The wrinkle in her
panties. It's mesmerizing!

00:18:32.821 --> 00:18:36.950 position:50% align:center
Damn it! She's
simply too powerful!

00:18:37.033 --> 00:18:41.913 position:50% align:center
Off I go. I was not prepared
for the real thing.

00:18:47.043 --> 00:18:50.130 position:50% align:center
[WHITE-CLAD C] What?
Assault's mission was a failure?

00:18:50.213 --> 00:18:53.675 position:50% align:center
[WHITE-CLAD A] Even he was
no match for this target.

00:18:53.758 --> 00:18:57.178 position:50% align:center
[WHITE-CLAD B] Does anyone
know where he is right now?

00:18:57.262 --> 00:19:00.265 position:50% align:center
[WHITE-CLAD D] He's set off
on a new training mission.

00:19:02.308 --> 00:19:04.561 position:50% align:center
[ASSAULT] It was naive to
think pictures and video

00:19:04.644 --> 00:19:05.979 position:50% align:center
would prepare me.

00:19:06.062 --> 00:19:07.522 position:50% align:center
Not even close.

00:19:07.605 --> 00:19:11.026 position:50% align:center
It is simply no
substitute for the flesh.

00:19:11.109 --> 00:19:13.361 position:50% align:center
To that end... off I go!

00:19:13.445 --> 00:19:15.238 position:50% align:center
Inside!

00:19:15.321 --> 00:19:16.322 position:50% align:center
[OWNER A]
Welcome, sir.

00:19:16.406 --> 00:19:17.532 position:50% align:center
[CABARET GIRL A]
Welcome, sir.

00:19:17.615 --> 00:19:18.783 position:50% align:center
[OWNER A]
Here for anyone in particular?

00:19:18.867 --> 00:19:20.326 position:50% align:center
[CABARET GIRL B]
One bottle coming up!

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:22.245 position:50% align:center
[CUSTOMER A] You've definitely
got more bounce than last time.

00:19:22.328 --> 00:19:23.997 position:50% align:center
[CABARET GIRL C]
Ha! Oh, you!

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.415 position:50% align:center
[CABARET GIRL D]
What's wrong, Scythe?

00:19:25.498 --> 00:19:27.667 position:50% align:center
Why are you crying again?

00:19:27.751 --> 00:19:30.754 position:50% align:center
[SCYTHE] Because my daughter
treats me like I don't exist!

00:19:30.837 --> 00:19:33.006 position:50% align:center
[ASSAULT] This place is
making my heart race

00:19:33.089 --> 00:19:34.674 position:50% align:center
and my skin tingle.

00:19:34.758 --> 00:19:37.344 position:50% align:center
[SCYTHE]
I love my Maka so much, though.

00:19:37.427 --> 00:19:38.970 position:50% align:center
I try to be a good
father at least!

00:19:39.054 --> 00:19:40.972 position:50% align:center
[SAKI]
Good evening, sir.

00:19:41.056 --> 00:19:44.642 position:50% align:center
I'm Saki. It's so
nice to meet you.

00:19:44.726 --> 00:19:46.561 position:50% align:center
[ASSAULT]
This girl is dynamite.

00:19:46.644 --> 00:19:50.273 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow. You look so
debonair in that tuxedo.

00:19:50.357 --> 00:19:51.941 position:50% align:center
Leave a wedding to come here?

00:19:52.025 --> 00:19:55.153 position:50% align:center
I can already tell that you're
nothing like the other guys.

00:19:55.236 --> 00:19:56.571 position:50% align:center
[ASSAULT]
Um, you can?

00:19:56.654 --> 00:20:00.325 position:50% align:center
Yeah, there's something
special about you, obviously.

00:20:01.409 --> 00:20:03.370 position:50% align:center
[ASSAULT]
I'm really not like other men,

00:20:03.453 --> 00:20:07.999 position:50% align:center
so there's no reason why I
can't beat Tamaki Kotatsu.

00:20:08.083 --> 00:20:11.628 position:50% align:center
I'm much better at talking to
women than I'd ever imagined.

00:20:11.711 --> 00:20:15.799 position:50% align:center
Interesting. Maybe I have a gift
with the ladies, after all.

00:20:15.882 --> 00:20:19.302 position:50% align:center
I'm ready this time,
Tamaki Kotatsu.

00:20:19.386 --> 00:20:20.887 position:50% align:center
Away!

00:20:22.305 --> 00:20:24.140 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
What? No!

00:20:24.224 --> 00:20:26.476 position:50% align:center
Ugh, why me?

00:20:27.811 --> 00:20:30.772 position:50% align:center
Hey. Don't look.

00:20:31.981 --> 00:20:33.024 position:50% align:center
[ASSAULT]
What's happening?

00:20:33.108 --> 00:20:35.819 position:50% align:center
She's so bashful and innocent!

00:20:35.902 --> 00:20:38.279 position:50% align:center
I'm weak against amateurs!

00:20:38.363 --> 00:20:39.656 position:50% align:center
Heh?

00:20:42.826 --> 00:20:45.578 position:50% align:center
[ASSAULT]
She's too good. The best.

00:20:45.662 --> 00:20:50.667 position:50% align:center
By far the most formidable foe
I've ever gone up against.

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:54.004 position:50% align:center
I can't let her beat me
off like this anymore.

00:20:54.087 --> 00:20:56.256 position:50% align:center
I am the Assassin of the Abyss.

00:20:56.339 --> 00:21:01.386 position:50% align:center
I'm Assault, damn it!
The Bloody Incendiary Round!

00:21:03.054 --> 00:21:04.681 position:50% align:center
[ASSAULT]
After my third defeat,

00:21:04.764 --> 00:21:06.474 position:50% align:center
I went to a place
where strong winds

00:21:06.558 --> 00:21:08.518 position:50% align:center
made skirts and
cover ups fly away

00:21:08.601 --> 00:21:10.562 position:50% align:center
and waited with bated breath.

00:21:10.645 --> 00:21:13.815 position:50% align:center
Nothing would slip by my
finely-honed visual acuity

00:21:13.898 --> 00:21:15.400 position:50% align:center
and situational awareness.

00:21:15.483 --> 00:21:17.277 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN B] Ah! This wind
has a mind of its own!

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:18.862 position:50% align:center
[ASSAULT]
All these amateur panties!

00:21:18.945 --> 00:21:23.450 position:50% align:center
I must see them and turn
myself to steel against them!

00:21:23.533 --> 00:21:25.076 position:50% align:center
My training is complete.

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:28.121 position:50% align:center
I've prepared for every
conceivable factor.

00:21:28.204 --> 00:21:31.291 position:50% align:center
At last. You've truly
conquered your weakness?

00:21:31.374 --> 00:21:33.043 position:50% align:center
I have.

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:37.088 position:50% align:center
[YONA gasps]

00:21:37.172 --> 00:21:39.424 position:50% align:center
He neutralized my attack
with a single finger.

00:21:39.507 --> 00:21:42.385 position:50% align:center
And his senses are razor sharp.

00:21:42.469 --> 00:21:46.014 position:50% align:center
Now, Assault. Off you go.

00:21:49.225 --> 00:21:50.810 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:53.605 --> 00:21:56.649 position:50% align:center
[ASSAULT]
Off I go.

00:21:56.733 --> 00:21:59.444 position:50% align:center
He can't be beat.

00:22:00.904 --> 00:22:02.197 position:50% align:center
[TAMAKI]
Ugh! You again?!

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:03.823 position:50% align:center
What in the hell
is your problem?

00:22:03.907 --> 00:22:06.368 position:50% align:center
It's our last encounter.

00:22:06.451 --> 00:22:08.203 position:50% align:center
[VOICE A]
Peek-a-boo.

00:22:08.286 --> 00:22:10.538 position:50% align:center
[ASSAULT]
This has been a time of growth.

00:22:10.622 --> 00:22:12.707 position:50% align:center
I have a handle on myself.

00:22:12.791 --> 00:22:15.543 position:50% align:center
You're goin' down,
jerk, you know that?

00:22:15.627 --> 00:22:17.587 position:50% align:center
Oh, am I now?

00:22:17.671 --> 00:22:20.757 position:50% align:center
I will make myself
as hard as steel.

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:22.092 position:50% align:center
[ASSAULT]
She's right.

00:22:22.175 --> 00:22:25.512 position:50% align:center
I'll wilt as soon as her
secret weapon is revealed.

00:22:25.595 --> 00:22:30.892 position:50% align:center
I can try until I go blind,
but I don't have a chance.

00:22:30.975 --> 00:22:35.689 position:50% align:center
Feelings for an opponent
make things quite different.

00:22:35.772 --> 00:22:37.315 position:50% align:center
[ASSAULT]
Away!

00:24:21.836 --> 00:24:23.588 position:50% align:center
[IRIS] The 8th receives
an urgent message

00:24:23.672 --> 00:24:25.423 position:50% align:center
from the Imperial Armed Forces.

00:24:25.507 --> 00:24:28.301 position:50% align:center
It's an invitation to join
them in a new war.

00:24:28.385 --> 00:24:31.930 position:50% align:center
Really? Oh, no,
this is terrible!

00:24:32.013 --> 00:24:34.808 position:50% align:center
[MAKI]
Go back to the army?

00:24:34.891 --> 00:24:36.518 position:50% align:center
[IRIS]
Next time on <i>Fire Force</i> ,

00:24:36.601 --> 00:24:40.355 position:50% align:center
Season Two, Episode Nineteen:
"The Oze Family."

00:24:40.438 --> 00:24:44.025 position:50% align:center
Return to the great
