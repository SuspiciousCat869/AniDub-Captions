[MICHAEL]
Stop your trembling!

4
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:51,208
Show some courage.

5
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:54,041
Or are you not the
vanguard of the gods?

6
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:15,500
[MICHAEL] This is a portent
of Bahamut's revival.

7
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:17,916
You must act quickly,
maiden of Orleans,

receiver of my light and
divine revelation.

[JEANNE]
Is that you, Lavalley?

11
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:48,041
[LAVALLEY]
These winds are brutal.

12
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:49,416
They've cut off
all communication

13
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,958
with our contingent.

14
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:53,416
It seems our only option is to
wait for the storm to pass.

15
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,708
[JEANNE]
This is no ordinary storm.

16
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:57,166
Look.

17
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,416
What does it mean?

18
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,958
[JEANNE] Now that the God Key
has been removed

19
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:03,916
from holy ground,
the balance between

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,833
gods and demons
is collapsing.

21
00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:07,666
[LAVALLEY] Are we no longer
protected by the grace

22
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,291
of the gods, then?

23
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:18,083
I fear that we're not.

You won't...

27
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:09,791
I refuse...

28
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,083
...to let that...

Curse you, Pazuzu.

00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,375
You're such a showoff.

34
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:04,708
Yeah, we can't let him
take all the credit this time!

35

[AZAZEL]
Down, girl.

36
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:07,833
You stink like a dog.

Ah!

That's not very nice.

You're lucky my little ones
are out on a walk.

40
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:14,791
You're lucky I let you indoors.

It's my castle, you know.

42
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:17,875
Jeez, you're uptight.

47
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:26,166
Yeah? Oh, that's great! Where?

48
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:30,125
A town! In fog! It's called
Nebelville, ARF! ARF!

00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:31,375
Really?

50
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:33,541
Can we kill them now?
Can we, please?!

51
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,375
You seem to forget
our orders, Cerberus.

52
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:38,541
We need to find out
who she's working for.

53
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:41,583
Why don't we just capture
and cripple her?!

54
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:44,625
We can still have
some fun watching.

55

Wait and see.

56
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:50,958

Am I lucky or what?

Only I would run into
a gigantic monster

while picking a damn plant.

of restorative arts.

91

What's that mean?

92
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,000
[FAVARO]
It's a type of sorcery.

93

Weird spells and stuff.

94
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:01,916
So, we need to have antidotes
ready, just to be safe.

going to eat the monster?

Are you feeling
better now, sir?

I'm sure it's confusing
waking up like this.

to join us, if you're up for it.

you got freaking wings!

You could've saved me
all the trouble

116
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:19,000
and flown up to
get this yourself!

00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:21,000
No, I couldn't have.

There, you see?

I lost one during the incident.

121
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:28,666
Now I can't fly...

122
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,750
Wait, what incident?

123
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,625
The incident.

124
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,541
This is it.

125
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:44,666
The sacred God Key.

00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:46,500
Yeah.

132
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:49,916
[FAVARO] So that's what that
royal tin can was talking about.

133
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,958
[GAURIN] We don't rest until
that God Key is found!

134
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,583
You're telling me
you flew up there

135
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,541
and slipped past all those
gods all by yourself?

136
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:57,916
That's right.

137
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,708
You don't believe me?

138
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:02,750
[MICHAEL] I can't explain this,
but it did happen.

139
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:05,208
She infiltrated our
sacred chambers.

140
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:07,291
She walked upon holy ground.

141
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,833
That should have been
impossible for a demon.

142
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:12,125
She broke the key's
ancient and powerful seal

143
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:13,833
by using the divine magic.

144
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:15,708
But only a god could do that.

145
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:17,125
Then she somehow got away,

146
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,875
despite all of the
gods' defenses!

147
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:21,708
Okay, if you really did
steal this thing,

148
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:25,125
then prove it to me; where are
you keeping this fancy key?

149
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:26,500
It's resting right here.

150
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,291
There? Really?

151
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:29,583
Let me see-- [grunts]

152
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:32,083
The God Key is not a
physical object.

153
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:34,125
[groans]

154
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:35,458
I took the key.

155
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:38,541
By absorbing its essence,
its soul, into my own.

156
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:41,000
Which means,
for all practical purposes...

157
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:46,416
She has altered
its very nature.

158
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,375
[groans]

159
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:52,708
...I am the God Key now.

160
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,208
[RITA'S DAD] We're just
simple folk in this village.

161
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:00,375
 I'm sorry we can't
offer you a fancier meal.

162
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:01,875
This is perfect.

163
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:04,833
I'm just grateful that you came
to a total stranger's aid.

164
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:06,041
I'm in your debt.

165
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,041
[RITA] I'm the one
who brought you here.

166
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,208
Well, dig in.

172

ask you for a favor too.

173
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,250
[KAISAR]
Of course.

174
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,083
We've been under attack.

175
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:35,583
Horrible monsters have
been terrorizing our village.

176
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:36,833
Monsters?

177
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:38,833
[RITA'S DAD] Trolls...
Or something like them.

178
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:42,250
They live in the forest, and
come out every morning, at dawn.

179
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:44,791
They ravage our fields,
eat our livestock,

180
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:47,541
and... take our children.

181
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:48,625
Yes.

182
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:50,375
Rita's the only child
that survived.

00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:03,416
As a Lidfard,

188
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,333
I will repay this great kindness
your family has shown me

189
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:07,958
by slaying these
monsters for you.

[BOTH gasp]

191

[RITA'S MOM]
What's wrong, Rita?

192
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,708
You haven't touched your food.

193
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:17,375
"Food" is a pretty
generous word for this, Mother.

194
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:19,208
I'm not eating maggot soup.

195

[RITA'S DAD]
Rita!

196
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,250
[KAISAR]
I'll talk to her.

197
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:43,083
You really shouldn't speak to
your parents like that, Rita.

198
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:44,916
[RITA]
Did you eat that filth?

199
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,666
Of course I did, it brought
back memories of my family.

200
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,666
[RITA]
You'll regret that.

201
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,166
What about that meal was so bad?

202
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,916
Where should I start?

203
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,041
I could only fool
myself for so long.

204
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:00,416
I'm sick of playing family;
it's a farce.

205
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,125
You're quite the thinker.

206
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,708
So how old are you?
Should I guess?

207
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:05,958
[RITA]
I don't even remember.

208
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,458
But I'm definitely
older than you.

209
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:10,125
I'm trying to be serious.

210
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:12,583
Maybe I understand you
more than you think.

211
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:17,708
You see, I used to think
my family was annoying, too.

212
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:20,125
I come from a
long line of knights,

213
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:23,791
and my upbringing was strict,
not much time for fun.

214
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:26,625
I was angry a lot,
mostly at my father,

215
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:28,708
and I stayed away when I could.

216
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:31,541
Like you. With your family now.

217
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:35,125
[KAISAR] But one day,
my father was tasked

218
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,958
with guarding our city's
tribute to the king,

219
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,958
and there was
trouble on the road.

220
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:42,708
Bandits ambushed
and stole the tribute.

221
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:45,583
My father, as leader
of the guard,

222
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:48,083
was held responsible
for the lost treasure.

223
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:49,583
And they hanged him.

224
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:55,583
[KAISAR]
I saw him die.

225
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,958
[KAISAR]
The prestigious Lidfard family

226
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:01,708
was stripped of its
titles and knighthood.

227
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:05,791
We were banished to the
lower quarter, like criminals.

228
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:09,916
My mother cried every night
for a full year and a half,

229
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,916
then threw herself into a lake.

230
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,083
And it wasn't until
that moment when she died

231
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,625
that I realized...

232
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,083
...how much I'd actually
loved my family.

233
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:23,708
How much they'd meant to me.
But it was... too late.

234

[KAISAR]

323
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:58,875
[KAISAR sobs softly]

324
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:01,458
[RITA grunts]

325
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:05,791
[BACCHUS]
Here you go.

326
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,916
Seven hundred and fifty Rupies.

327
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,416
--[FAVARO] You're getting cheap.
--[AMIRA] Come here!

328
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,958
[HAMSA] No, you mad woman!
Get away from me!

329
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:12,333
Hey! Don't eat the duck!

330
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:13,750
[BACCHUS]
New bounties came in,

331
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:16,458
which you might
find interesting.

332
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,541
Oh yeah? Any easy pickings?

333
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:19,875
What the hell?!

334
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:21,458
--[BACCHUS chuckles]
--Damn... Royal... Knights!

335
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:24,541
That's fine, I've got
plenty more here.

336
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:26,208
See?

337
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:28,625
Ooh, wow. Those poster
artists are terrible!

338
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:30,125
That could be anybody, right?

339
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:32,833
[BACCHUS] So, I heard the
girl mention Helheim.

340
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,166
Oh, yeah, she's freaking
obsessed with getting there--

341
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,958
[gasps]

342
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:38,583
They've got some great booze.

343
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:40,708
It's one of my
favorite places to drink.

344
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:42,875
[laughs]

345
00:23:18,916 --> 00:23:20,625
[RITA]
Can you slow down a little?

346
00:23:20,708 --> 00:23:24,041
You're walking too fast.

347
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:27,416
[KAISAR] You do realize I never
asked you to follow me, right?

348
00:23:28,916 --> 00:23:32,041
[RITA] You're supposed to
respect the dead.

349
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:35,375
You kids today have no manners.

350
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:39,250
[sighs]
Suit yourself.

351
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:42,250
[RITA] So, why didn't you lop
off my head before I turned?

352
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:43,666
[KAISAR]
I don't cut the dead.

353
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,250
It would taint my sword.

354
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:47,875
[RITA] You had no problem
plowing through my zombies.

355
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:50,166
[KAISAR] I said the dead,
not the undead.

356
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:52,000
That's a different matter.

357
00:23:56,166 --> 00:23:58,083
[KAISAR] I think everyone's
starting to realize it!

358
00:23:58,166 --> 00:23:59,291
[FAVARO]
Realize what?

359
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:00,500
[KAISAR] These previews
aren't that serious!

360
00:24:00,583 --> 00:24:01,833
[FAVARO]
Hey, I'll race ya. GO!

361
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:03,291
[BOTH] On the next
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis:

362
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:04,416
Reunion at Yesmenport!

363
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,833
--[FAVARO] Yes!
--[KAISAR] You cheated.
