1
00:00:56,916 --> 00:00:58,541
Brace yourselves, humans.

2
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:01,291
The time for fun
and games is over.

3
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:08,916
More demons.
They want the God Key!

4
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,791
The angel Michael commanded
me to keep it safe.

5
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:14,291
Tell them our
defenses can't fail!

6
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:52,375
That's a lot of riders.

7
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:57,208
[FAVARO yelps]

8
00:01:57,291 --> 00:02:00,000
Hey! Where've you been,
and why'd you sneak out?

9
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:01,000
Old man!

10
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:02,000
What?

11
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:04,083
I met the old man!

12
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:07,625
Look, that's pretty vague.
And it sounds creepy at night.

13
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:10,583
Hold on--old man? Are you
talking about a dad? Whose dad?

14
00:02:10,666 --> 00:02:14,833
My dad, he's here!
I met him just now!

15
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:16,875
You're saying your father
is in the capital?

16
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:19,958
[sound of stomach rumbling]

17
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:23,250
I'm really hungry!

18
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:26,458
Tch! You can't just say
something crazy like that

19
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:28,000
and run off!

20
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:01,083
[SOLDIER 7A]
Lower the drawbridge!

21
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,458
You're late.

22
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:13,333
[LAVALLEY] I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

23
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:16,291
What's our strategy,
Saint Jeanne?

24
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:17,708
[JEANNE] You'll
defend the outer wall

25
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,458
with the sorcerer and catapult
divisions, Sir Gaurin.

26
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:22,583
Sir Lavalley, you'll
lead the dragon knights

27
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:25,041
against invaders
at the second wall.

28
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:31,458
I'll remain here, and protect
the castle with His Majesty.

29
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,000
[LAVALLEY and GAURIN]
Sir!

30
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:39,291
Move out!

31
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,875
[FAVARO]
Amira, where'd you go?

32
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:47,000
That girl needs a collar...
with a bell. Eh?

33
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:58,041
[FAVARO groans]

34
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,916
Found him.

35
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Favaro.

36
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:03,291
[FAVARO]
Great, we're all here.

37
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:06,458
Um, where's Lady Amira? Hm?

38
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,958
Oh, good. Did she
say what happened?

39
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:14,375
[FAVARO] Well, according
to her, she met her father.

40
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:16,083
And now she's all hyped up.

41
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:18,375
What, her father?
In the castle?

42
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:21,250
[RITA] So it's a
celebration meal?

43
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,166
There, you satisfied now?

44
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,208
[AMIRA sighs]

45
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:37,541
[AMIRA hiccups]

46
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:38,791
[AMIRA giggles]

47
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:40,916
[FAVARO] How big
is your stomach?

48
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,791
[GIANT GHOUL roars]

49
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,291
[GIANT GHOUL roars]

50
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,750
Don't give up!

51
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:20,666
We must stop the demon
invasion, no matter what!

52
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:24,750
Don't tell me...

53
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:45,583
Archers release!

54
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:56,958
Meddlesome flies.

55
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:21,125
Decent work. Seems she
poses the only real threat.

56
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:23,416
[PAZUZU]
Leave her to me.

57
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,291
Just don't botch it up.

58
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:26,833
[PAZUZU]
Hm.

59
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:35,166
Get out of our city!

60
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:44,291
[JEANNE]
The bridge!

61
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:49,750
[PAZUZU] Compared to us, you're
little more than pond scum.

62
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:51,791
It's time for you to learn

63
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:56,166
exactly how trivial
your human powers are.

64
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:18,041
[AMIRA] I don't wanna, I don't
wanna, I don't wanna!

65
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:21,208
I'm not done eating--let go!

66
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:23,875
You already ate enough
for ten people, come on!

67
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:26,000
Lady Amira,
the city's under attack!

68
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,375
We need to make
sure you're safe!

69
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:30,625
[all three yell]

70
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:38,000
Man! Ow! What the hell?
She really is like a little kid.

71
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:41,000
I doubt she's even aware
of the situation she's in.

72
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:42,541
[FAVARO]
Hm?

73
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:46,083
You saw how worried those
angels were about her safety.

74
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:48,208
We must prevent the
revival of Bahamut,

75
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:50,166
no matter what the costs.

76
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:54,166
Keep the God Key safe.
It's up to you, o valiant ones!

77
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,958
[RITA] Clearly these
demons have come for her.

78
00:08:58,041 --> 00:08:59,458
Clearly.

79
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:01,083
So, what should we do?

80
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,666
I'm not sure.

81
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,708
But for now, let's try to move
her to a better hiding place.

82
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:06,000
Too late for that.

83
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:07,541
[FAVARO and KAISAR gasp]

84
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:24,458
It's you again!

85
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:35,666
[FAVARO] It was him.
Now I'm sure of it.

86
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,250
There's no need
to struggle.

87
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:40,458
Just be good little humans
and hand over the God Key.

88
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:41,791
Not a chance!

89
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:44,458
[AZAZEL] Oh, dear, is that
your "chivalry" talking?

90
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:48,333
Noble to a fault,
just like your father was.

91
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:51,875
You still haven't explained
how you knew my father.

92
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:54,000
And what if I told you
I was the reason

93
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:56,291
he was sent to the gallows?

94
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:58,083
[FAVARO gasps]

95
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:00,291
[AZAZEL]
Oh, I remember it well.

96
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:03,458
[indistinct distant screaming]

97
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:06,750
[AZAZEL] The vicious jeers the
people showered on your father.

98
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,833
That delicious fire
in their eyes...

99
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:11,833
That contempt in their voices!

100
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:15,083
"Let that pathetic
knight swing till dead!"

101
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:18,333
If I could bottle that malice,
I would drink it all day.

102
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:20,708
You arranged it? Why?

103
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:23,541
Those gemstones were
toys of mine, actually.

104
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:25,666
When I planned it,
I thought Amon's betrayal

105
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,708
would be the best part.
Those villagers...

106
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:31,583
They made your
father's death so fun.

107
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,291
I'll never forget those shouts.

108
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:34,833
[KAISAR shudders]

109
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:38,291
[FAVARO] You got a real gift
for storytelling, wing-boy,

110
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,083
but let's get
the facts straight.

111
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:43,208
The bastard who got
his old man killed...

112
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,666
That bastard
is right here.

113
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,666
Am I supposed to laugh?

114
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,291
What are you doing?
He just said...

115
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:52,791
Listen, Kaisar, I've got
a little mission for you.

116
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:54,750
Take Amira and run for it.

117
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:57,875
I'm leaving it to you to
get her safely to Helheim.

118
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:03,666
Go on, get out. This is a
battle between two demons now.

119
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,291
--He'll kill you!
--[RITA] Hey.

120
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,125
Do what he says.

121
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:18,583
Between two demons,
you say? How interesting.

122
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:21,291
[FAVARO grunts]

123
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,541
Seize the God Key, darlings.

124
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,750
Hey! Come on, that's cheating!

125
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:37,166
I am a demon, aren't I?

126
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:46,333
[PAZUZU]
What's the matter?

127
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:50,125
Is the human's heralded
warrior already done?

128
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,458
[JEANNE]
Ngh!

129
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:58,583
[JEANNE grunts softly]

130
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:02,333
[PAZUZU] Fighting you is beneath
me, but it's almost over.

131
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:08,791
This is the end of your baseless
bravado. This is when you die!

132
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:15,583
[SOLDIER 7F]
Saint Jeanne!

133
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:17,541
[PAZUZU]
Barely a fight.

134
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:29,708
Come! Maltet!

135
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:35,333
[PAZUZU]
Impossible!

136
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:38,500
[JEANNE yells]

137
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:42,333
[PAZUZU groans]

138
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:44,375
Now tremble before
my sacred power,

139
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:47,375
you abomination of
darkness and impurity!

140
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:50,166
[SOLDIER 7G]
She got him!

141
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:56,333
[PAZUZU laughs]

142
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:58,625
Does your death amuse you?

143
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:02,583
[PAZUZU] I wouldn't count this
as a victory if I were you.

144
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:05,333
We'll get what we came for.

145
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:08,500
The God Key!

146
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:15,958
Saint Jeanne.

147
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:17,208
Lavalley.

148
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:18,791
Are you injured?

149
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:22,500
It's fine, I'll live. The only
thing that matters is the girl.

150
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,583
Yes, captain, understood.

151
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:41,833
[FAVARO pants, grunts]

152
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:45,916
[FAVARO]
A... Ah!

153
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:53,541
Aw, great! A fork's
not gonna work here!

154
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:04,500
For a moment I thought
you'd actually challenge me.

155
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:09,875
But since you're so
disappointing,

156
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:12,375
I guess I'll just
take the Key now.

157
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:27,541
Kaisar!

158
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,416
[KAISAR] I swiped one
of your bombs earlier.

159
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,041
Thought I'd use it on you.

160
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:35,208
Guess even knights can get
a case of the sticky fingers.

161
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,416
So where's Amira?

162
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,125
In good hands.

163
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:44,083
[moaning and roaring]

164
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:49,625
[FAVARO] Not that
I'm ungrateful,

165
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,166
but why'd you come back?

166
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,458
[KAISAR]
For revenge, Favaro.

167
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,458
[FAVARO]
Uh-- Uh...

168
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:57,333
Can't let this demon kill you.
Or I'd never have

169
00:14:57,416 --> 00:15:00,333
my vengeance for what you
did to my father, would I?

170
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:03,208
[AZAZEL laughs]

171
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:05,041
Oh, Favaro, that's right!

172
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:07,875
You're that thief Barossa's
son--I almost forgot!

173
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:11,083
This is almost too
hilarious for words!

174
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:13,333
Your little dynamic is
starting to make sense.

175
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:15,291
So you took on this
role of "sworn enemy"

176
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,000
to give him a reason to live!

177
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,500
What?

178
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,375
Only humans can
manage such touching

179
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:23,500
and melodramatic nonsense.
That's why I like to come here.

180
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:25,750
You could say it's
my guilty pleasure.

181
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,208
This makes me feels proud.

182
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:29,291
I'm responsible for
both your father's deaths

183
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:31,833
and you've been fighting
for years because of me!

184
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:35,916
Very well, we can
play for a little bit.

185
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I am busy, but this theater
is too good to resist!

186
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:42,416
You got a screwy
view of things, pal.

187
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,583
My old man's dead because he
messed up, simple as that.

188
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:48,250
Avenging him, giving
Kaisar a reason to live--

189
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,208
I don't give a damn about that.

190
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:55,500
I don't live for some ideal.
I'm not wasting my time

191
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:59,250
trying to fix an old wrong or
make somebody else feel happier.

192
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:03,083
[FAVARO] I live for myself.
And that's it.

193
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,416
Favaro.

194
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,500
[FAVARO] You're not
my arch-enemy.

195
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,083
You're not my anything.

196
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:13,000
You're just a stupid demon
who happens to be in my way.

197
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:16,708
You'll pay for
that disrespect.

198
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:21,625
I suppose that's what
makes us so different.

199
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:25,750
I have my way of seeing
the world and you have yours.

200
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:26,916
Well I'll give him one thing--

201
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,250
he's right about
you being dramatic.

202
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:32,125
I can't change how I am.

203
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:33,791
Yeah, I know.

204
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:47,833
Yet another
desperate smoke screen.

205
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:50,666
[AZAZEL]
Nice try.

206
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:53,708
You okay, Kaisar?

207
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:56,791
Perhaps you should be
more worried about yourself.

208
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:01,666
Now you die.

209
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:05,250
You know what?
I'm finally learning

210
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:06,625
how to use this thing.

211
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:08,541
You have a tail?

212
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:11,666
It's like I told you.
This is a fight between demons.

213
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,041
[FAVARO]
Boogedy boogedy boogedy...

214
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:19,708
Don't let a measly contract
spell go to your head.

215
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,875
[KAISAR]
No.

216
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,583
This is a battle between
human and demon!

217
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:32,166
Two humans and a
demon, to be exact!

218
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,708
[KAISAR yells]

219
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,708
[AZAZEL groans]

220
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:41,625
Did that kill him?

221
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:45,000
Just kidding.

222
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:46,541
[KAISAR and FAVARO gasp]

223
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:55,250
[AZAZEL] So sorry
to disappoint you,

224
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:59,166
but I can't be killed
with human steel.

225
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,958
[FAVARO snarls]

226
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:05,083
[AZAZEL] Seems that
overgrown flying cat

227
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:08,750
has failed me;
how disappointing.

228
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:12,041
No matter. I'll simply
have to kill you both now

229
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,208
and finish this myself.

230
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:16,166
Son of a bitch.

231
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:20,541
Gotta be somethin' we can
do to kill this jerkoff.

232
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:37,500
[KAISAR]
I'm changing the plan.

233
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:38,708
[FAVARO]
Huh?

234
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,583
[KAISAR] You take her
to Helheim, Favaro.

235
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:45,291
I'll take care of him.

236
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:49,250
[KAISAR yells]

237
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,708
Get ready to
join your father.

238
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,875
[KAISAR grunts]

239
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:03,083
[KAISAR grunts, yells]

240
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:06,416
[FAVARO gasps]

241
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,625
[FAVARO]
Kaisar!

242
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:12,958
The shortcomings
of my own kind

243
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:15,250
are what caused
my father's death.

244
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:21,083
You're not his killer.
You're a coward

245
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:25,208
whispering from the shadows.
A little demon in the dark.

246
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:29,000
And now, you'll meet the light.

247
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:36,416
[AZAZEL screams]

248
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:41,958
[AZAZEL groans]

249
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:46,500
Miserable humans!

250
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:48,791
[AZAZEL screams]

251
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:53,000
[JEANNE exhales]

252
00:19:53,083 --> 00:20:01,750
[SOLDIERS cheer]

253
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:05,250
Your Majesty,
the demons are defeated!

254
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:08,541
We must give
thanks to the gods.

255
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:11,666
We did it, Saint Jeanne.
Good work.

256
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,500
Those two bounty hunters we
captured with the girl...

257
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:16,291
Tell me their names again?

258
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:36,625
[FAVARO groans heavily]

259
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,750
Favaro...?

260
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:41,166
Can you hurry up and
climb, you dumbass?!

261
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:44,750
I'm about to split
in friggin' two!

262
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:47,333
[FAVARO yelps and whimpers]

263
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:48,875
[KAISAR] Right.

264
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:58,041
[LAVALLEY] Amira.
You need to wake up.

265
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:07,750
[AMIRA] Father?
Is that you?

266
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,416
Finally.

267
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:16,125
It's over. Now let's
get you back to your...

268
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:20,708
Perfect.

269
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:04,541
[AMIRA] Father? Father?
Where'd you go?

270
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:57,291
--[BACCHUS] Admit it!
--[HAMSA] What?

271
00:23:57,375 --> 00:23:58,625
[BACCHUS]
You're a damn duck!

272
00:23:58,708 --> 00:23:59,750
--[HAMSA] I am not a duck!
--[BACCHUS] Nonsense!

273
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:01,208
[HAMSA] What if
I talk like this:

274
00:24:01,291 --> 00:24:04,291
On the next Rage of Bahamut:
Genesis: Beyond the Storm.

275
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:05,875
--[BACCHUS] Still a duck.
--[HAMSA] Drunk.
