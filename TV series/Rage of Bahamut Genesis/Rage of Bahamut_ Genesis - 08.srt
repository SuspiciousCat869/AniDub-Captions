1
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:10,250
[AMIRA screams]

2
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:12,166
Lady Amira!

3
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,916
[URIEL] I feared the
humans would not be able

4
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,625
to protect the
God Key on their own.

5
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:19,250
[RAPHAEL] Jeanne D'Arc
may indeed be capable

6
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:22,000
of becoming a Holy Knight.

7
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:24,375
[MICHAEL] Yes, and this
conflict surrounding Bahamut

8
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:26,833
will surely resolve through her.

9
00:01:26,916 --> 00:01:29,458
[GABRIEL] No. We will
be the ones to end it.

10
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:31,625
She is merely an instrument.

11
00:01:31,708 --> 00:01:33,666
We've yet to identify
the demon masterminds,

12
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,833
or their end objective,
but that will soon come.

13
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:39,125
What matters now is that
we assert our control,

14
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:40,791
as our kind should.

15
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:43,375
We must reclaim the God Key.

16
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,333
[CHARIOCE] Saint Jeanne,
holiest of maidens.

17
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:31,666
You've served your king in war
magnificently, once again.

18
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,750
As a reward, I shall grant
you a territory of your own.

19
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:39,708
What would you like?
Baruzo? Ruelle?

20
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:43,291
I'm grateful, sire.
But I must humbly decline.

21
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:46,875
Decline? Are you sure?

22
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:49,166
I have no doubt, sire.

23
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,416
There is, however, one
request I would make instead.

24
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:55,750
[AMIRA]
Ah...!

25
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:57,583
[KAISAR] Are you
all right, my lady?

26
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,583
[AMIRA]
What happened?

27
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:06,750
[KAISAR] You fainted by the
statue. We're not sure why.

28
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:09,500
I'm pretty sure I know why.
She drank a whole barrel.

29
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,250
It's not helpful
when you talk.

30
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:15,208
I, uh... I had a dream.

31
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:17,125
About when I came
out of my cocoon.

32
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:18,625
Cocoon?

33
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:19,958
I was sleeping there.

34
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:22,875
Growing inside it for
who knows how long.

35
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:28,500
[MARTINET]
Wake up, Amira.

36
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:46,208
You are one of the most special
beings in all of creation.

37
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:49,208
I am... special?

38
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:55,208
[MARTINET] You must fulfill
your mission, my dear Amira.

39
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:57,416
Do so faithfully,
and your greatest wish

40
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,541
will most certainly come true.

41
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:03,916
She waits for you now, in
the promised land of Helheim.

42
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,250
Go to... Helheim?

43
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,750
[MARTINET] She is the
key to your happiness.

44
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:13,833
She is all you desire.
Go to her.

45
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:15,625
[AMIRA]
My mother...

46
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:21,500
You said before that pendant
helps you remember her, right?

47
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:24,583
[KAISAR] I'm sure you miss
your family a great deal.

48
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:25,958
[AMIRA]
Father!

49
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:28,500
Hey now, no more disappearing.
Where are you going?

50
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:30,750
My father was calling
for me when I fainted!

51
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:34,583
Calm down. You want to see
your dad; I can understand that.

52
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:36,500
But it's not safe to
go wandering around.

53
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,916
[door creaks]

54
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,625
What about her father?
What are you talking about?

55
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:45,250
Oh, nothing. We're just
telling stories.

56
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:47,083
You come here for a reason?

57
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:51,208
The king wants to see you.
At the steps of his throne.

58
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:52,750
[FAVARO]
Wha...?

59
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,250
Anyone want to guess
what this is about?

60
00:05:58,333 --> 00:05:59,708
[RITA]
How would I know?

61
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:01,875
Maybe he's going to send us
to the gallows after all.

62
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,750
That's easy to joke
about for a zombie,

63
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:05,125
since you're already dead.

64
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:06,125
[AMIRA yelps]

65
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:07,250
Huh? Now what?

66
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,875
That's my father!
By the woman!

67
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:12,875
[RITA] Are you kidding? That's
Jeanne D'Arc's lieutenant.

68
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:14,083
Father!

69
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,291
Can we talk before you
cause a royal scene?

70
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,916
Do you seriously think
that big shot is your dad?

71
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,666
If that's true, it's
significant. For starters...

72
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,958
it would mean he's
not really a human.

73
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:26,333
A demon in disguise?
I'd buy that.

74
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:27,541
[KAISAR]
No.

75
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,416
He can't be a demon.

76
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,833
Yeah. That'd be crazy.

77
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:34,083
--[FAVARO yells]
--[RITA] Make up your mind.

78
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:37,083
I met him once before,
in the city of Wytearp.

79
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:39,750
I was close to giving up.

80
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:43,333
Desperation is a powerful force.
It can make a man stronger.

81
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:45,541
Don't ever forget that.

82
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:50,833
[KAISAR] He inspired me
when I needed it most.

83
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:56,083
He's a proud and
honorable knight.

84
00:06:57,416 --> 00:07:00,375
[CHARIOCE] Favaro Leone.
Kaisar Lidfard.

85
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:03,041
My kingdom is in your debt.

86
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:05,791
For your heroics against
the demon raiders,

87
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:08,750
I confer on both of you
the title of knight.

88
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:09,750
[FAVARO]
Huh?!

89
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:11,958
[KAISAR]
Knighthood? For us?

90
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:13,541
[FAVARO]
Your Maj....

91
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:15,375
Thanks for the gesture, but that
sounds like way more hassle--

92
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:17,541
[KAISAR] We gratefully
accept, sire!

93
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:24,000
[FAVARO gasps, groans]

94
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:28,375
[MINISTER 8A]
Hear ye!

95
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:31,375
The ceremony of knighthood
shall now commence.

96
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:34,583
[CHARIOCE] As king of this
realm, I hereby appoint you both

97
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:37,500
to the royal order of
the Orléans Knights.

98
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,958
[KAISAR] You honor
us too much, sire.

99
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:41,750
Yeah, you shouldn't have.

100
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:01,541
[FAVARO chuckles]

101
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:03,416
[KAISAR]
Hm.

102
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:07,416
At long last,
I have fulfilled my oath.

103
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,208
I'll never have to
hunt bounties again.

104
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:12,875
That's too bad. Cause you
can't take off that bracelet.

105
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,458
I mean, you can't even
break it with a sword.

106
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:15,666
[KAISAR]
What?

107
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,458
Not unless you're in
that drunk's presence.

108
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:19,000
Who knows what tavern he's at?

109
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:21,875
--[BACCHUS sneezes]
--[HAMSA] Bless you!

110
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:24,000
[CHARIOCE] Saint Jeanne, these
are the courageous warriors

111
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:27,375
who fought the demon invaders
with us. I have no doubt

112
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:30,458
they will make my royal
Orléans Knights even stronger.

113
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:32,875
[JEANNE] Most wise,
Your Majesty.

114
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:39,958
[CHARIOCE]
The angel Michael!

115
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:47,750
You have battled magnificently,
o valiant humans.

116
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,833
You are serving the gods well.

117
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:52,541
Of course. It is our
honor to serve.

118
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:55,125
As long as the God Key
is on human ground,

119
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:56,875
there will be more
activity from the demons,

120
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:59,208
and you must be well-armed.

121
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:05,791
Thank you.

122
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:14,458
[MICHAEL] The Précieuse, a sword
capable of both blessedness

123
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:18,250
and malevolence.
It can even slay a god.

124
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,625
I bestow it unto you,
Saint Jeanne.

125
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:23,125
May you use its
power righteously.

126
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:25,375
I swear that I shall.

127
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:28,000
Michael. And what about me?

128
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:31,750
Yes, Your good faith
will be rewarded.

129
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:34,666
Continue to serve us piously,
and your endeavors

130
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,250
will have the
blessing of the gods.

131
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:46,916
[AMIRA gasps]

132
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:58,500
[AZAZEL groans]

133
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:08,958
[BEELZEBUB] You are
truly pathetic, Azazel.

134
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:16,708
[AZAZEL]
Beezlebub!

135
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:23,291
You deceived me!

136
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:26,208
[AZAZEL yells]

137
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:30,416
[AZAZEL screams]

138
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,750
The puppet's usefulness
comes to an end.

139
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:41,333
[AZAZEL] What end are
you trying to achieve?

140
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:44,166
Why are you betraying
Lord Lucifer?

141
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,375
[BEELZEBUB] All realms
will know soon enough,

142
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:48,541
for the moment is nigh.

143
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:53,208
Moment? What moment?

144
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:57,583
[BEELZEBUB]
The moment of judgment.

145
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,833
[CHARIOCE]
Curse that usurping woman!

146
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:15,416
The king of Anatae is
the proxy for the gods!

147
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,875
They should only
be speaking to me!

148
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:19,625
She rejected my
offer for land,

149
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:21,791
which would have gotten
her out of my city!

150
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:24,041
And now Michael
openly humiliates me

151
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:26,666
by giving her that
holy sword instead!

152
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:35,083
Oh, tell me, Mother, please!
Who is the most revered

153
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:38,291
in the capital? Who do
the people love more?

154
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:45,250
[IZVELLIA] You must
be careful, my son.

155
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,750
[CHARIOCE gasps]

156
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,791
[CHARIOCE]
Mother!

157
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,875
[IZVELLIA] There is a
traitor in your midst.

158
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:57,291
A viper who wants
to take your life.

159
00:11:57,375 --> 00:12:01,583
Who wants to kill me?
Who is it, mother?

160
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:05,041
You know the
answer, son. Look!

161
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:10,333
[CHARIOCE]
Jeanne D'Arc?!

162
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:19,125
[CHARIOCE yells]

163
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:20,375
This is a warning.

164
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:23,208
A vision of what will
very soon come to pass.

165
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:24,750
Jeanne will come.

166
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:27,500
She will strike you down and
steal your kingdom for herself.

167
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:30,125
I won't let her!
I don't want to die!

168
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:33,041
[CITIZENS' VOICES] Saint Jeanne!
Saint Jeanne! Saint Jeanne!...

169
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:34,666
[CITIZEN 8A] All hail
the maiden saint!

170
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,250
[CITIZEN 8B]
She's the light of Anatae!

171
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,500
[CITIZEN 8C] The king
is dead! Good riddance!

172
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:41,500
[CHARIOCE] I won't
allow it! I won't!

173
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:47,291
I'm the king.
It's not right!

174
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,875
[FAVARO]
Hey.

175
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:02,500
[FAVARO chokes, grunts]

176
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,083
I can't breathe!

177
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:05,708
[AMIRA]
Oh, it's you.

178
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:08,000
[FAVARO grunts]

179
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:09,458
Damn it...

180
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:12,208
I said to stay put!
How was that not clear?

181
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,708
I'm sorry, it's just...

182
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:16,500
[RITA] You can finally
see your father,

183
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:19,041
and it's hard for you
to pass that up.

184
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:24,041
[FAVARO sighs]

185
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,458
[FAVARO]
Come on. Let's go.

186
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:33,125
[RITA] This isn't the
way to our quarters.

187
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:35,666
[FAVARO]
Yeah, yeah, I know.

188
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:41,333
If my information's right, then
your old man should be up there.

189
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:43,833
You won't be happy till
you see him, right?

190
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:45,291
[AMIRA]
Mm.

191
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:47,708
Then go up and do it
already, would ya?

192
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:51,708
[AMIRA giggles]

193
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:53,625
Thank you, Fava!

194
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:56,666
I'll be damned.

195
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,083
That's the first time
she ever said my name.

196
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:04,083
Well, she forgot the "ro,"
but you know, baby steps.

197
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:06,791
Hey, what are you doing?
This isn't a group trip!

198
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:09,708
[RITA] If you think I'm going
to miss this, you're insane.

199
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,250
Yeah, fair point.

200
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:18,958
[AMIRA]
Um... Father?

201
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:33,500
You're here,
Amira. I'm glad.

202
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:37,000
I had to come.

203
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:39,750
It's hard to believe you
were a baby five years ago.

204
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:43,166
[FAVARO]
Five years? Uh...

205
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,958
[FAVARO laughs]

206
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:47,041
Sorry about that. My bad.

207
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:48,625
Leone. From what
I understand,

208
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,958
you've saved her life
more than once.

209
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:53,833
I'm sure this was more
than you bargained for.

210
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:55,708
Thank you for
keeping her safe.

211
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,291
He had help.

212
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:01,791
Amira. We need
to talk now.

213
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:05,333
It's high time you learned the
truth about you and your mother.

214
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:12,583
The gods of war
have been wiped out?

215
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:14,916
[MICHAEL] It doesn't appear
to be the work of Azazel

216
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,208
or his lord.
But whoever did it--

217
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,416
[GABRIEL] Is the
mastermind behind

218
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,583
the theft of
the key, obviously.

219
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:23,416
[MICHAEL] Gabriel,
what should we do?

220
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,125
[GABRIEL] Instruct the
humans to increase

221
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:28,416
security in their capital.
We must prevent the key girl

222
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,833
from being abducted while we
prepare for our next move.

223
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:39,958
[GABRIEL] If Lucifer isn't
behind this, who could it be?

224
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:48,083
It's been a long time,
Beelzebub.

225
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:51,083
[BEELZEBUB] Azazel has
failed you miserably.

226
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:54,250
Demonkind cannot afford
more blunders, Lucifer.

227
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:57,666
[LUCIFER] A real pity. I'll
just have to send someone else.

228
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:01,875
[BEELZEBUB] No need.
I will take over from here.

229
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:03,458
[LUCIFER]
Is that so?

230
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:05,250
[BEELZEBUB] Do you
object to that?

231
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:06,875
No.

232
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:08,458
[BEELZEBUB]
Once I retrieve the girl,

233
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:10,583
we will have both
sides of the Key.

234
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:14,791
Then the re-manifestation
of Lord Satan can begin.

235
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:23,916
[LAVALLEY] As the angels said,
Amira is remarkably special,

236
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,916
born from a union
between demon and god.

237
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,083
Yeah! I've been
wondering about that,

238
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:31,416
So a demon and a god
actually hooked up?

239
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,541
Do their parts
even line up right?

240
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,125
Do they even have parts?

241
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:36,833
So what does
that make you?

242
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:38,291
[FAVARO groans]

243
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:39,500
[FAVARO]
Eh?

244
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:42,833
I do know Amira,
but I'm not her father.

245
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:44,333
I am an ordinary human.

246
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:45,666
[AMIRA gasps]

247
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,833
[LAVALLEY] It was five
years ago. I was assigned

248
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:50,625
as a bodyguard for an angel
who needed assistance.

249
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:55,166
Her name was Nicole,
Amira. Your mother.

250
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,791
She had been cast out of Heaven,
forbidden to ever return

251
00:16:57,875 --> 00:17:01,708
to her kind. Despite this,
she looked so happy.

252
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:05,625
Because she had
you in her arms.

253
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:08,458
As her guard, we faced
relentless demon attacks,

254
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:11,166
and we were exhausted.
But seeing the two of you

255
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:14,916
in our camp gave us the hope
we needed to survive.

256
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,500
But then...

257
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,375
[LAVALLEY] After you
were kidnapped,

258
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:35,000
Nicole left for the
demon realm on her own,

259
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:37,500
determined
to get you back.

260
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:43,833
She left this pendant
with me, to keep safe.

261
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:47,541
I was reassigned, and continued
fighting in other campaigns.

262
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:52,625
For a time I searched for Nicole
on my own, but to no avail.

263
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:55,333
And then, that day
at the bridge...

264
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:00,666
The pendant told me
all I needed to know.

265
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,500
You had grown, but there
was no mistaking it.

266
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,791
You were Nicole's daughter.

267
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:09,250
Fascinating tale. So the demons
kidnapped her as a baby

268
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,416
and sped her growth so
they wouldn't have to wait.

269
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,333
That explains why
she's so childish.

270
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:15,125
I just thought she was weird.

271
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:19,000
So what now? I was told over
and over I could see her again.

272
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:20,958
As soon as I took
the key to Helheim!

273
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:22,250
[LAVALLEY] And now
that you know the truth,

274
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,291
you're right not to
trust those words.

275
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:28,083
Helheim is a demon stronghold;
a god couldn't survive there.

276
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:30,708
But if she's not there,
where is she?

277
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:33,583
Your pendant.
Let me see it.

278
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,416
Well, I certainly didn't know

279
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,458
her little keepsake
could do that.

280
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:55,000
That's it. Her true location.
In the valley of Prudisia.

281
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:56,166
You know that place?

282
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,666
No.

283
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,500
If you let this be your guide,
then you can reach

284
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:03,166
your mother at last.
Please take it with you.

285
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:06,666
Another compass. I won't
break it this time.

286
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,958
Your mother had a power that
was unusual, even among gods.

287
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:11,375
and I believe
that's another reason

288
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:13,875
the demons were after her.

289
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:16,291
If it's possible to
free you of the God Key,

290
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:18,750
then she's the one
who can do it.

291
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:21,666
It's settled.
Of course I'll go.

292
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,500
What? Seriously?

293
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,000
That should mean
she'll remove your tail.

294
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:27,750
Oh, yeah! I think
it's a great plan.

295
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,458
Believe me, Amira, I would
go with you if I could.

296
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:34,375
Yes, I know that. Your soldiers
need you here. I understand.

297
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:36,375
I'm sorry. When you find her,

298
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:38,416
be sure to thank her for
the faith she had in me.

299
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,791
No.

300
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:41,791
I'm going to bring
her back with me.

301
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,958
So you can thank her in person!

302
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,125
Sounds good.

303
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:47,416
[FAVARO sniffs]

304
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,916
I didn't know you
were such a softy.

305
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,833
[FAVARO]
Yeah.

306
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:54,958
Just the thought of finally
getting rid of this tail...

307
00:19:57,666 --> 00:20:00,333
And you'll go with me.
Right, Fava?

308
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:03,583
[FAVARO] Hell, no! I'd rather
jump in a damn fire!

309
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:06,625
Wish I could. I bet
your mom's a real looker.

310
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:09,041
It'd be great to meet
her at least once.

311
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,291
But I've got other plans
I just can't get out of!

312
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:12,500
You sure?

313
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:14,416
[FAVARO] Yeah, I mean,
it breaks my heart,

314
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,291
but I've got
responsibilities, you know.

315
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:17,666
Well, too bad.

316
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,166
[FAVARO sighs]

317
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:22,916
That's nice. Are you gonna
tell Kaisar about this?

318
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,583
He's back to being
a fancy tin can now.

319
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:28,166
He's got no reason to hang
around with us anymore.

320
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,250
Guess that means
the three of us'll

321
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:33,166
have to be your
send-off party.

322
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,083
Though I highly doubt we
can sneak her out of here

323
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:37,625
without some
serious distraction.

324
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:40,875
[FAVARO]
Heh.

325
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:50,916
More demons?

326
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,333
[RITA] Honestly.
Just 'cause I'm a zombie

327
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:19,208
doesn't mean they can
work me like a slave.

328
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:22,000
[FAVARO] Sneaking out the
underground water channels.

329
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:24,250
Lavalley's clever,
I'll give him that.

330
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:28,000
[FAVARO breathes deeply]

331
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:29,916
[FAVARO] I still can't
believe that tiny little lie

332
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
got me into all this crap.

333
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:38,375
But now it's finally over!
Now get this tail off me!

334
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:42,416
Oh, no. What's with
the wavy hand?

335
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,375
Well, you did say you wanted
to meet my mother, didn't you?

336
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:49,583
[FAVARO]
Aahhh...!

337
00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:35,416
[CHARIOCE] The soldiers are in
a frenzy! What's going on now?

338
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,041
What? Who's there?

339
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,708
Oh, it's you.
Thank goodness.

340
00:23:52,541 --> 00:23:56,375
[CHARIOCE screams]

341
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:57,708
[JEANNE]
Should I get dreadlocks too?

342
00:23:57,791 --> 00:23:59,166
[LAVALLEY]
I don't think so.

343
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:01,125
[JEANNE] On the next
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis...

344
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:03,375
[LAVALLEY] Decision
in the Wailing Woods.

345
00:24:03,458 --> 00:24:04,833
[JEANNE] Your answer
wounds me deeply.

346
00:24:04,916 --> 00:24:05,916
[LAVALLEY]
Eh?
