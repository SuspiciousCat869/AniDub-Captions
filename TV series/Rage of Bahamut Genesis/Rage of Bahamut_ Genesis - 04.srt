1
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:47,500
These look so tasty...

2
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:50,291
Hey. Keep up, would ya?

3
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:51,416
I thought you were in a rush.

4
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,541
I am.

5
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:53,916
And you never said
anything about us

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,791
having to sail to
get to Helheim.

7
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:58,250
Ah! Yeah, well... uhhh...

8
00:01:00,958 --> 00:01:02,916
[FAVARO]
Did I just hear you right?

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,500
You sure did, they've got
some killer booze there!

10
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:06,750
No! Not that part!

11
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:07,958
[HAMSA]
Stop it!

12
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:09,041
I mean the route!

13
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:11,083
Do you really know
how to get there?

14
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:12,416
'Course I know the way.

15
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,250
Who do you think
you're talking to?

16
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:17,500
A "G-O-D" God.

17
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:18,958
[sighs]

18
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:21,583
And you're a dumbass.

19
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:23,958
Because I just remembered
an even shorter shortcut,

20
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:25,208
that's all!

21
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:26,875
All we need to do
is get on the boat,

22
00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:28,791
and then we'll be in
Helheim in no time!

23
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:32,708
[FAVARO]
I know that death stare.

24
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:34,333
You still don't trust me.

25
00:01:34,416 --> 00:01:37,583
Look in these eyes and you tell
me they're the eyes of a liar.

26
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:39,041
Ow!

27
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:13,541
A merchant ship
going to Helheim?

28
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:15,000
Not that I know of.

29
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:18,458
What's a Helheim?
If it tastes good, I'll try it.

30
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:20,083
--How would I know?
--Don't ask me!

31
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,375
Which boat?

32
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:24,291
Keep your hair on,
I've got this under control!

33
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:26,833
It prob'ly just
hasn't sailed in yet!

34
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:28,416
[growls]

35
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,291
[FAVARO] Bacchus,
you lousy drunk.

36
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:32,375
Did you give me a bogus tip?

37
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,208
[gasps]

38
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,500
I love seafood.

39
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:41,416
[FAVARO]
Great...

40
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,041
If I don't come up with
something quick,

41
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:46,416
she's gonna know I've been
lying to her this whole time!

42
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,791
[YOGI] Did I hear you
need passage to Helheim?

43
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,750
The boat's right over there.

44
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:58,458
Uh... Oh, of course!

45
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:02,666
Silly me, I remember!
It's right over there, yeah!

46
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,166
What a relief.

47
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,166
[AZAZEL]
They lost them?

48
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,333
[CERBERUS] They followed the
trail all the way to Nebelville,

49
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:18,833
that's worth something, right?

50
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,708
Then their scent
just vanished, ARF!

51
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:22,791
It's strange, ARF!

52
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:24,166
[PAZUZU]
That's what you get for relying

53
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,125
on those glorified mittens.

54
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:28,083
[MALE DOG]
He's talking trash, ARF!

55
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,000
[FEMALE DOG]
He is trash, you're right, ARF!

56
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:30,750
[PAZUZU]
What?!

57
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:31,666
[BOTH squeal]

58
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,291
[AZAZEL]
That's enough, children.

59
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:36,666
Someone must have intervened
to help cover their tracks.

60
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,375
It could have been the gods.

61
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:40,541
Or one of their human pets.

62
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,875
Or perhaps it was a demon.

63
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:45,041
[PAZUZU] You think someone
could be making a move

64
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:46,750
against Lord Lucifer?

65
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:48,041
It is possible.

66
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:49,916
With dear old Satan
out of the picture,

67
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,833
the God Key could be a big deal.

68
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:54,583
Maybe someone wants to use it
put their butt on the throne!

69
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:57,666
Send down your dogs to
resume their search.

70
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,333
You look, too, Pazuzu.

71
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,333
We will find her.

72
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:08,250
And then we'll learn
exactly what she's planning.

73
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:11,958
Oh yeah, here we go!

74
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:14,416
This is the boat
to Helheim, I knew it!

75
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:26,291
That's reassuring...

76
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:30,208
The Celephales. Yes.
And that's her captain.

77
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:31,750
The one with the beard.

78
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:34,875
[FAVARO]
Hmm...?

79
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:37,291
[CAPTAIN]
Hm?

80
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:40,000
[FAVARO growls]

81
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:42,791
[CAPTAIN]
Hmmm...?

82
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:43,666
[gasps]

83
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,583

[BOTH laugh]

85
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:50,708
Amon! You bastard,
you're alive?!

86
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:52,458
[AMON]
Hey, that's my line!

87
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:54,458
[AMON]
What in the hell, Favaro?!

88
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:56,375
What are you doing
in these parts?!

89
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:01,416
[AMON grunts]

90
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,875
[FAVARO growls]

91
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:07,625
Who's that? Is that your mother?

92
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:10,916
--Of course he's not!
--Of course I'm not!

93
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,958
Been three years, huh?

94
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:35,083
What're you up to these days?

95
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:39,208
So you're not following in
your old man's footsteps?

96
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:42,041
'Cause that's what Barossa
would've wanted for you.

97
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:43,750
Yeah, well, too bad.

98
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,166
[FAVARO]
I was never into the whole

99
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:50,333
leader of the "honorable,
merry bandits" career path.

100
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:53,208
"Rob from the rich,
to give to the poor?"

101
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:56,541
Sorry, but that's
not really my thing.

102
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,416
I like being in
business for myself,

103
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,333
it keeps life simple
and doesn't cramp my style.

104
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:03,791
Well, then who's your friend?

105
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:06,416
Dragging a young girl
around while bounty hunting

106
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,416
doesn't sound simple to me.

107
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,583
[FAVARO]
True.

108
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:12,416
But I kind of just
fell into it, you know?

109
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,541
[KAISAR]
Have you seen this miscreant?

110
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:18,333
Yeah, I have, actually.
Looking for a boat.

111
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:20,333
[growls]
A boat to where?!

112
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:22,291
[MAN A]
Uh, I forget.

113
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:25,666
But he's probably
long gone by now.

114
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,541
Well, that's a shame.

115
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,125
Sounds like we
got here too late.

116
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:30,583
[KAISAR growls]

117
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:33,833
[KAISAR]
Why are you following me?

118
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:35,416
[RITA]
To pass the time.

119
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,041
[KAISAR growls]

120
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:39,125
I'm just kidding.

121
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,958
I was alone in that
village so long--

122
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:42,833
you can't know what that's like.

123
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:46,583
There's nothing left for me
there, and you seem nice enough.

124
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:47,750
So what will you do?

125
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,750
[growls]
Whatever it takes!

126
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:52,708
I don't care if it takes me
to the far edge of the world!

127
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:54,458
I'll hunt him down.

128
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:55,958
I swear it!

129
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:58,750
For it to matter that much
you must really hate him a lot.

130
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,166
How come?

131
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,458
It's a long... story.

132
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:04,041
[YOGI]
Pardon me, Sir.

133
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:05,666
I think I can help you.

134
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,291
For a... fee.

You don't look tasty.

[FAVARO] Hey you, Miss
Catch-and-Release-Fisherman.

00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:42,791
Does This creature
look familiar to you?

143
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,875
[AMIRA]
A duck?

[FAVARO]
Tch! What?! No!

145
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:50,125
It's like huge,
and scaley, you know?

146
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:51,416
[AMIRA]
An alligator.

147
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,875
Aw. Come on, no!
It's way bigger!

148
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:56,458
Like, like the size
of a mountain!

149
00:08:56,541 --> 00:09:00,666
And it breathes fire, and it can
burn whole cities to a crisp!

[sighs]

151
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:02,625
It doesn't look tasty.

152
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,125
Honestly, how hungry
is this girl?

[AMON]
Favaro.

154
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:09,333
How 'bout we knock one
back together?

155
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,333
I got some food in there, too.

--[gasps]
--Yeah, sure!

157
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:15,416
As luck would have it,
I am feeling parched.

00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,000
Hey, slow down!

159
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:18,583
He asked me!

160
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:26,083
You were going to say something
about that nemesis of yours?

161
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,958
For an undead girl,
you're certainly curious.

162
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:31,750
[KAISAR]
Whoa! [yells]

163
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:33,500
Okay, fine!

164
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,916
Favaro and I were
childhood friends.

165
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,958
[growls]

166
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:44,166
[AMON]
What do you remember?

167
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,166
About that final heist
we did with Barossa?

168
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:50,000
Stealing that hefty
tribute to the king.

169
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:51,958
And all that followed.

170
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:54,041
I belonged to a
family of knights.

171
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:56,083
His family were carpenters.

172
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:58,166
Despite the difference
in our classes,

173
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,958
we got along very well together.

174
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:02,458
We saw each other
almost every single day.

175
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:10,291
[KAISAR] I told him everything,
including about my father,

176
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:14,166
because I... thought
we were best friends.

177
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,916
That snake!

178
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,166
[HORSES whinny]

179
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:23,291
He used me.

180
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:25,833
Deceived me for all those years.

181
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,875
His father was
actually a thief.

182
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:31,458
And he'd just been waiting
to get information from me!

183
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:32,500
I failed.

184
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:35,333
He used me to
sabotage my father.

185
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:38,875
He ruined our lives!

186
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:39,958
That night.

187
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:43,041
My old man was
killed on the road.

188
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:46,458
[AMON] Part of the tribute was
a case of strange gemstones,

189
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:48,708
containing powerful magic,

190
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,833
and just by handling
the damn things,

191
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,666
we summoned a horrible demon.

192
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:57,791
[gasps]

193
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:59,250
[thunder cracks]

194
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:07,250
[AMON] Our whole raiding party
was slaughtered in minutes.

195
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,500
I was the only one
who made it out alive.

196
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:14,250
It was your old man who saved
my life, that heroic bastard.

197
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:15,708
[FAVARO]
Hmph.

198
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,958
Favaro.

199
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:20,541
I'm gonna get you to Helheim;

200
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:23,500
it's the least I can do
to repay my debt.

201
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:24,958
[FAVARO]
Thanks, Amon.

202
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:36,000
[AMIRA]
Who's this "old man?"

203
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:37,166
[FAVARO]
What old man?

204
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,916
That wrinkly guy
back at the port?

205
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,125
Not him!

206
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:42,541
The one you were talking
about in your story!

207
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:45,791
[FAVARO] Oh. That's what
I call my father.

208
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,041
Your father?

209
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:50,041
Yeah, my freaking
father, okay?!

210
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:51,916
You got one, right?

211
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,083
I'm not sure.

212
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:56,916
What is a father, exactly?

213
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Now how the hell
do I answer that one?

214
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:01,416
You know, it's just
your parent who's a guy!

215
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,541
It's your dad, your pops,
your mom's husband!

216
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:04,666
[AMIRA]
Husband?

217
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,791
What's that?

218
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:07,000
Okay...

219
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:08,916
You're just messing
with me, aren't you?

220
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,375
My old man. My husband.

221
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:14,875
Oh boy. No, not
your husband, your mom's!

222
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:16,333
My father...

223
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:21,750
[yelps

224
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:22,416
What's that?!

225
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,875
[gasps]

226
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:44,583
[SEPER] Sorry to interrupt
this heart-to-heart.

227
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:48,000
But it's time you went
for a little dip in the sea.

228
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:49,333
What are you talking about?

229
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:51,625
[SEPER] Hand over your
valuables before you jump.

230
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:53,000
And we'll take the girl.

231
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:56,125
She'll fetch an even higher
price than your sword.

232
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,625
So you're pirates?

233
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:59,083
I should've known.

234
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:00,916
You'll regret this.

235
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,541
You can carry on that
tough guy act all you want--

236
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,291
from the bottom of
the sea floor.

237
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:06,375
[yells]

238
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:10,166
[grunting, yelling]

239
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:13,000
You bastard! Yaah!

240
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,458
[grunts]

00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,375
[SEPER]
Nice moves, Bounty Hunter.

242
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:19,833
But that's enough.

243
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:21,458
Throw down your sword.

244
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:22,958
[KAISAR growls]

245
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:26,041
[SEPER]
Sorry to break it to you, pal,

246
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:28,000
but your luck has
finally run out.

247
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,291
[KAISAR] It seems like
you're the unlucky one.

248
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:31,458
If you ask me.

249
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:32,750
Huh?

250
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:35,416
[snarls]

251
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,750
Whoa!

252
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,583
Giant freaking crab!

00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:40,958
Oh, delicious!

254
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:43,958
[FAVARO] Huh?! I mean it
does have nice color to it,

255
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:45,750
but it's also tryin' to kill us!

256
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:57,708
[AMON]
It's called the Shipwrecker!

They say it's sunk
countless vessels!

[FAVARO]
We've gotta fight it!

259
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,041
Where are your weapons?!

260
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:03,791
[AMON]
We don't have weapons!

261
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:07,416
--She's a damn cargo ship!
--[FAVARO] Oh, right!

Look what we found!

00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:52,541
[retches]
It's not tasty...

00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,541
Oh. Good to know.

268
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:57,041
What in the hell was that?!

269
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,458
[FAVARO]
Huh? Oh, it was nothing!

270
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:00,666
Uh...

271
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,250
Or it was something
but not a bad something,

272
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:03,625
it's just kinda hard to explain.

273
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:05,666
[AMON] Does it have anything
to do with that tail?

274
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:06,541
[FAVARO]
What?

275
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:07,708
[gasps]

276
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:09,458
Uh, I can explain that, too.

277
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,166
It's not really a tail, see?

278
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,083
I mean it is, but, heh--

279
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:15,375
Well, color me surprised.

280
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:17,833
So you've been dancing
with demons, too.

281
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,291

[whimpers]

286
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:33,625
[AMON] You stay right
where you are, little lady.

287
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:36,541
Amon! You dirtbag!

288
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:39,791
[AMON]
Had myself a career change.

289
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:42,125
I went from being a thief.

290
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,000
To a demon's ward!

291
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,458
[AMON laughs]

292
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:48,458
[AMON] It was all
planned from the start.

293
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:51,333
Lidfard's execution
for failing to protect

294
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:53,000
all of that beautiful treasure.

295
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,000
And the slaughtering of
Barossa and his men

296
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,916
by a mysterious
demon on the road.

297
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,958
That same demon
granted me magic powers.

298
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,458
I arranged the
whole thing for him!

299
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:02,875
Their blood was the price I paid

300
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:05,041
and it was worth
every last drop!

301
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,500
You betrayed my old man?

302
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,083
Got him killed?

303
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:12,250
I'm not cut out to be an
honorable bandit either, boy.

304
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,250
You're dad was always
such a goodie-goodie

305
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:15,916
when I just wanted to get rich.

306
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,666
It was suffocating,
just being around the guy.

307
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,333
So, anyway, imagine
how surprised I was

308
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:24,125
when I heard you were at
the port, looking for a ride.

309
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:27,416
Now I get to profit off

Of course you're really
more like the appetizer.

312
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:32,166
In terms of bounty,

313
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,333
the girl's definitely
the main course.

314
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:36,041
Who is this million-Rupie girl?

315
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:38,333
I don't know who she is,
I just met her, okay?

316
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:41,500
[AMON] Fine. Then there's
no reason to keep you alive.

Get out of here!

320
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:46,833
And how would I run?

321
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:49,083
I'm tied up,

00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:00,916
[KAISAR] You can control zombies
without your spell book?

324
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,500
Unfortunately for my victims,

325
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,500
I have more than
one tool for the job.

326
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,708
But you're a zombie
yourself now.

327
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:09,041
Why aren't you
mindless like them?

328
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:10,083
[RITA]
You should hold on tight.

That damn kid!

Where the hell did he go?!

333
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:26,583
[AMON]
Don't let 'em escape! Move!

Favaro!

[FAVARO]
Kaisar?

339
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,000
Wait. You?

340
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:48,208
Aren't you Lidfard's son?!

341
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:50,583
I am. Who are you?!

342
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:53,083
So you're a
bounty hunter, too, now?

343
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:55,291
Well, hands off!
Those two are mine!

Well, this is a first.

Favaro!

00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:23,708
I will be taking the girl!

351
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,875
This guy's mine.

[yells]

353
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:44,791
Know what your dad...
hated... the most?!

354
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,916
He hated rich guys and
the people in charge.

355
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,250
And demons!

356
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,250
And that's why he refused
to learn about magic,

357
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:52,708
despite its power!

358
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:54,416
It's because of
that stubbornness

359
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,166
that he wound up dead!

Would you be careful?!

364
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,416
I could've died, man!

365
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:08,041
Hah! It's over now, Favaro.

366
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:09,958
Curse your bad luck.

367
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:12,708
The same way that Barossa did
that night on the road.

You're the one
with the bad luck.

[BACCHUS] Hamsa. Did I just
hear you say something?

383
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:21,541
[BACCHUS]
We gave 'em a lift here

384
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:23,458
so they wouldn't
attract attention.
