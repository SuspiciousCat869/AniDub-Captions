1
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:35,208
[MARTINET] You must
fulfill your mission.

2
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:37,916
My dear Amira.

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,291
Do so faithfully,
and your greatest wish

4
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:42,708
will most certainly come true.

5
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:47,833
She waits for you now, in the
promised land of Helheim.

6
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:50,125
My mo... ther...

7
00:00:57,708 --> 00:01:00,000
No sleeping, Amira.
You gotta hold on.

8
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:01,375
We're right
here with you!

9
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:03,750
Take me... to her.

10
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:06,750
What?
I can't hear you.

11
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:08,333
Easy on the hair! Easy!

12
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:14,708
Take me to her. Please.
Take me to... Hel... heim.

13
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:16,250
Quickly!

14
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:22,291
I'd love to, but I'm
thinking that won't fly.

15
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,750
Just once I'd like
to escape a crisis

16
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:31,875
without falling into another.

17
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:13,750
Sir Gaurin. Why am I not seeing
Sir Lavalley in the line?

18
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:15,625
He left the ranks earlier
to check on something,

19
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:18,541
Saint Jeanne, but I believe that
he'll catch up with us soon.

20
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:20,708
What is he checking on?

21
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:26,041
[KAISAR] Favaro,
where is your bracelet?

22
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:28,666
Oh, yeah!
Must've slipped off!

23
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,583
He destroyed it to
get help from Bacchus.

24
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:32,875
So we could reach
Gregor and save you.

25
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:35,625
You should work on
keeping your mouth shut!

26
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:40,041
He's the one responsible for
your father's death, right?

27
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:42,458
So why don't you
kill him already?

28
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:43,708
I don't have my sword.

29
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:45,458
Then strangle him,
it's not that hard!

30
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:48,166
That's for thieves,
and I'm a knight.

31
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,708
Besides...

32
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:55,500
We have an agreement.
Isn't that right?

33
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:56,625
[FAVARO]
Hm.

34
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:59,000
So what's the agreement?

35
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,750
Not your concern.

36
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:03,833
What about her, why's she
want to go to Helheim anyway?

37
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:06,166
From what I understand
it's an inhospitable place

38
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,958
completely covered in ice,
so I hardly see the appeal.

39
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:12,208
Well, apparently that's
where Amira's mother is.

40
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:14,250
Don't ask me what
she's doing there.

41
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:26,041
[MARTINET] Fancy
seeing you here.

42
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:31,208
[AZAZEL]
Martinet.

43
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:32,708
[MARTINET] Do you intend
to have an audience

44
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:37,166
with Lord Lucifer, Azazel?
Is that why you've come? Mm?

45
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,375
If I were you I would watch
where I stick my nose.

46
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:45,208
[AZAZEL shudders, gasps]

47
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:47,333
[MARTINET laughs]

48
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:49,250
I'm amazed you have
the gall to waltz back

49
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,125
to the capital like this
after being ambushed

50
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,833
and thoroughly humiliated
by those humans.

51
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,916
Do you honestly think
Lord Lucifer would deign

52
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,500
to meet with such
an abject failure?

53
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,125
You're an
embarrassment, arf!

54
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:01,791
Yeah! Get lost, arf!

55
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:04,875
I see the news
has traveled quickly.

56
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:09,166
Then I'll skip the conversation
and move straight to the task.

57
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,916
Getting back the God Key.

58
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:18,708
His Royal Majesty
Charioce the Eighth.

59
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:20,416
King of our land!

60
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:23,333
Good tidings, Jeanne D'Arc.

61
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:25,791
Our maiden saint blessed
by the gods in heaven.

62
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:28,541
I'm told you have accomplished
another great feat.

63
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:31,250
Your King is as grateful
and as proud of you as ever.

64
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,916
[JEANNE] I'm pleased
to hear it, sire.

65
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,541
Present the prisoners
to the king!

66
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:37,750
[KAISAR and FAVARO grunt]

67
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:40,875
[FAVARO] That's the king?

68
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:43,958
[LAVALLEY] Silence! You're
in His Majesty's presence!

69
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:50,791
She's the thief
we've been after.

70
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,541
[AMIRA groans]

71
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,291
Her? Are you sure of that?

72
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:57,166
Certainly looks like
an ordinary girl to me.

73
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:09,083
[AMIRA trembles]

74
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,750
I can't explain it, the gems
we use to spot demons

75
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:13,625
don't react to her, sire.

76
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,083
Oh...

77
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:19,333
And that is precisely
how the key was stolen.

78
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:20,875
[JEANNE gasps]

79
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:40,083
[CHARIOCE] Three angels...
descending at once?

80
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,375
Well, well. Get a load of
the fancy-ass cloud-dwellers.

81
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:45,416
[RITA]
Shh!

82
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,333
And I thought
Bacchus was classy.

83
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,250
[BACCHUS snores]

84
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:50,708
[HAMSA squawks]

85
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:53,791
[MICHAEL] Even we, the gods,
were fooled by this girl.

86
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:55,791
For that is her talent.

87
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:59,000
[AMIRA shudders]

88
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:04,333
[AMIRA screams]

89
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:11,500
[MICHAEL] This is how she
circumvented our defenses.

90
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:13,458
With the forbidden
power to transform

91
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:16,500
between god and
demon, at will.

92
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:19,500
So Lady Amira...
is an angel?

93
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:20,625
She's a demon, dumb ass!

94
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:22,541
Guys, she's both.

95
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,416
[AMIRA wails, whimpers]

96
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:29,833
Although she's only half,

97
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,250
the fact that the key is now
entangled with demon blood

98
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:34,791
means we cannot take her
back to the sacred Ark.

99
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:37,208
King Charioce. You will
keep her under heavy guard

100
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:39,041
in your royal
capital of Anatae.

101
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:43,416
[CHARIOCE] Yes, of course.
I shall guard her with my life.

102
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,583
But what of them? The vagabonds
who were traveling with her.

103
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,750
I assume we should treat
them as co-conspirators,

104
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:51,458
and put them to death?

105
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:53,208
What? Put to death?

106
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:56,541
How could one stupid lie
get me into so much trouble?

107
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,083
And now I'm gonna die for it?

108
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,208
So not fair!

109
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:02,833
[MICHAEL] You must
not take their lives.

110
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,875
[CHARIOCE] Indeed,
your wish is my command.

111
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:06,833
They will be dead
by the morning.

112
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:09,375
Lock them up and
prepare the gallows...

113
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:10,708
Wait. what did you say?

114
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:13,166
All four of them must
remain in your city.

115
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,708
It is imperative that
your forces protect them.

116
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:17,166
Protect them?

117
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,291
Yes! I knew you angels were
decent, I always said so!

118
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:21,208
Ow!

119
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:23,708
[MICHAEL]
Behold!

120
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:25,791
[CHARIOCE]
What? What is that?

121
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:27,500
[MICHAEL] Signs of
Bahamut's revival,

122
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:29,916
which grow ever more intense.

123
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,541
Bahamut? Who's that?

124
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:36,000
[RAPHAEL] Though it gains
strength, it cannot wake yet.

125
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:38,541
Its unsealing requires
the Transcendent Key,

126
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:41,083
the union of the two keys
that the Supreme God Zeus

127
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:43,875
and the Demon Lord Satan
formed from themselves.

128
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:46,208
[URIEL] Should the Transcendent
Key be brought to Bahamut,

129
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:48,916
horrendous catastrophes will
befall creation on a scale

130
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,541
your minds cannot fathom,
and life will be pushed

131
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:55,875
to the brink of extinction
as it was so many years ago.

132
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:58,125
[MICHAEL] It is thus
unwise to take the lives

133
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:01,041
of her companions.
The girl's emotional strain

134
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:04,666
could have unforeseen
consequences.

135
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:08,458
We must prevent the revival of
Bahamut, no matter the costs.

136
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:12,500
Keep the God Key safe.
It's up to you, o valiant ones!

137
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:14,125
[CHARIOCE]
As you command!

138
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:17,291
Well, what are you waiting for?
Release them at once!

139
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:18,833
[SOLDIERS]
Yes, sire!

140
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:25,000
Now, freedom is yours as long
as you remain in the city.

141
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:27,708
May our hospitality
soothe you weary travelers.

142
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:28,708
[FAVARO sobs]

143
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,083
[GAURIN]
Insolent cur!

144
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:32,125
Thank you, your
merciful majesty-ship,

145
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:33,500
I promise you won't regret this!

146
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,291
[SOLDIER 6B] Fool, you
don't touch the king!!

147
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:38,708
[FAVARO] Thank you, thank you!
Long live the king!

148
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:40,875
[AMIRA]
I hate this place!

149
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:45,291
I need to get to Helheim!
I have to see my mother!

150
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:47,750
[FAVARO] Come on, can you
tone down the crazy?

151
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:50,375
You're in no condition
to go anywhere right now.

152
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,666
Does your word
mean nothing to you?

153
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,916
You promised you'd
take me to Helheim!

154
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,083
Yeah, but...

155
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:58,416
You promised, you
promised, you promised!!

156
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,416
And I've been trying, okay?
But just so we're clear,

157
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,041
it's only 'cause you
put a dumb curse on me!

158
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:09,250
What? I'll be damned.

159
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:12,375
Isn't that interesting?
He's almost like a demon.

160
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:13,541
Almost?

161
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,250
[RITA] Don't you
listen to anything?

162
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:18,208
She cursed him, with some kind
of contract spell, presumably.

163
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:20,750
He's a run-of-the-mill
human, after all.

164
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:24,416
Favaro's human?
You're sure?

165
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,250
Of course I'm human, stupid,
you grew up with me!

166
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:28,958
Just a normal
former bounty hunter

167
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:30,458
who's had enough
of this crap!

168
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,083
And I'm not taking
you to Helheim.

169
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:33,541
I'm tired of risking my neck!

170

[AMIRA gasps]

171
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:36,416
So if you wanna go to
that wasteland so bad,

172
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,583
then go by yourself!
But first...

173
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:41,541
You need to get this damn
tail off me, right now!

174
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,458
Then a "thank you"
would be nice!

175
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,583
You liar!

176

[AMIRA sobs]

177
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:58,458
Oww... Something feels broken.

00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:03,583
[GAURIN]
Fiores Mondo Malit.

179
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:06,583
She can't leave these
quarters now. We'll keep her

180
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,333
under guard here until her
wounds have fully healed.

181
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:11,333
The rest of you can
use the room next door.

182
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:13,958
Actually, I would rather
have a private room as well.

183
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,375
[GAURIN]
Don't push your luck.

184
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:18,125
Under any other circumstances
we'd have hanged you.

185
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:19,458
Of course, we'll be
keeping your weapons

186
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,208
while you're in the castle.

187
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:22,208
[KAISAR]
Huh?

188
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:24,500
[FAVARO]
Damn it...

189

[bell rings]

190
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:30,458
What is that?
Some kind of signal?

191
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:35,791
It's a warning bell.
Means demons are approaching.

192
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,625
[bell continues ringing]

[GIANT GHOUL roars]

00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:55,000
[JEANNE]
They're ghouls?

196
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,208
[LAVALLEY]
That's the report--

197
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:58,000
and they're much
larger than before.

198
00:11:58,083 --> 00:11:59,916
[JEANNE] Then I'll
destroy them with Maltet.

199
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,250
They're nothing against
the spear of the gods.

200
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,000
[LAVALLEY] I'm not
sure that's wise,

201
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:05,875
going into battle by yourself.

202
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,458
[JEANNE]
I'm sure.

203
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:09,541
I can hear the gods
speaking to me now,

204
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:11,416
and their message is plain.

205
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,125
They're telling me to
attack without fear.

206

[GIANT GHOUL roars]

210
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:43,000
Those shots only
targeted the demons.

211
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:44,875
Her strength
keeps increasing.

212
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:47,083
She seems more powerful
now than ever.

213
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,708
[LAVALLEY] Maybe it's the
presence of the God Key.

214
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,458
It's hard to believe.

215
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:53,958
Demonkind is no
match for us now!

216
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:56,125
We have the blessings
of the gods to shield us!

217

[SOLDIERS cheer]

218
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:05,791

[CHARIOCE sighs]

220
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,083
[RAPHAEL] Containing Bahamut
has been more manageable

221
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:18,541
since her rescue.

222
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:20,250
It definitely seems
the girl's well-being

223
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:23,250
is now vital to maintaining
the ancient seal on the beast.

224
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:25,333
Indeed. But we still
can't afford to leave

225
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:29,125
the Key in the human's
custody forever.

226
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,416
[RAPHAEL] The human, Jeanne
D'Arc, was chosen to serve us

227
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,500
in the resealing,
should it come to that.

228
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,541
You'll have a grave
price to pay, Michael,

229
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,666
if that half-god,
half-demon keeps us

230
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,708
from carrying out our plans.

231
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:43,333
She surprised me.

232
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:10,166
She was protected
by powerful magic.

233
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,375
I believe someone
else was behind it.

234
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:14,250
[GABRIEL] The one
scheming to steal the key

235
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:17,000
and break Bahamut's seal.

236
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,083
[MICHAEL] I've received
word from the knights.

237
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:22,458
They say the girl was
on her way to Helheim.

238
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:27,333
To the location of the
other key, as we suspected.

239
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:28,791
If we continue
to hold the girl

240
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:31,000
within the royal
capital of Anatae...

241
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:33,500
the schemer will almost
certainly make a move.

242
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:36,583
This is the perfect chance
to expose who's behind this.

243
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,958
We will use her
to our advantage

244
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:41,708
and draw our enemy
from the shadows.

[FAVARO]
Now this is the life!

When they caught us,
I expected hell!

247
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:55,666
Ah, yeah. And instead I'm
in heaven with you angels.

248
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:56,833
It's great!

I don't understand
either one of you idiots.

If you hate him, why
aren't you doing anything?

No, I swear! I've been through
all kinds of danger and seen

256

tons of beautiful women, but
none are as pretty as you two!

257

You are too much!

258
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,416
So tell us, what's the most
dangerous place you've been to?

259
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,125
[FAVARO]
Let me think.

260
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:30,000
It's too hard to pick.

261
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:32,375
Hey. This could come in handy.

262
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:36,291
[LAVALLEY]
Poor thing.

263
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:38,208
[AMIRA]
Huh?

00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:42,458

tortured, from inside and out.

[AMIRA]
Who's there?

266
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:46,041
[LAVALLEY] You seek answers,
don't you? You wish to know

267
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:49,208
the real reason you were
brought into this existence.

268
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:52,541
And I am someone who
can grant you that wish.

269
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,750
No! Come back!

270
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:12,333
[FAVARO] Aw, man, I could
not drink another drop.

[KAISAR]
Huh?

00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:39,041
This is the perfect
chance for revenge.

276
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:41,666
That's what you
want, isn't it?

277
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,875
[KAISAR]
I'm not so sure. Maybe.

278
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:46,125
[FAVARO]
Huh...

279
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:48,500
I don't even know what
the truth is anymore.

280
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:51,250
I don't know how I should feel
or what I should do, and...

281
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:54,041
the more I think,
the more I get confused.

282
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:57,125
Tell me. Why did you
come to my rescue?

283
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:59,666
I've been chasing you all this
time. I'm clearly a hindrance.

284
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:03,708
And... And it seems
Lady Amira is too. So why?

285
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:05,666
What kind of person
are you, Favaro?

286
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:06,958
What's the truth?

287
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:11,000
[FAVARO] Isn't it obvious?
You know what I am.

[KAISAR]
Huh?

is so high-maintenance.

from my dreams.

Of all the people in the
capital, I had to run into her!

313
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:49,291
[FAVARO] Oh, just taking a
stroll to clear my head. See ya!

314
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:52,291
You came to Bahamut.
Do you know about it?

315
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:54,916
Uh-- Wait, did
you say Bahamut?

316
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,500
The great destroyer.

317
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:59,333
The one that would bring
about the end of our world.

318
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:03,000
Neither god nor demon,
its power surpasses us all.

319
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:06,791
It is said that mountains
will crumble, seas will boil,

320
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:09,125
and all realms will
be reduced to nothingness

321
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:10,708
once its power awakens.

322
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:13,958
That's Bahamut?
That's what they meant?

323
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:17,458
It happened many
centuries ago.

324
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:20,500
Bahamut appeared from
the skies without warning,

325
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:22,208
and turned the world
into a living hell

326
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:25,750
in the blink of an eye.
It set the lands ablaze,

327
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:29,666
nearly exterminating all
life in its merciless fury.

328
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,750
But then, just
as gods, demons,

329
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:34,875
and humans alike
had abandoned hope...

330
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:37,041
a miracle was performed.

331
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:42,833
[JEANNE] The Supreme God Zeus
and the Demon Lord Satan

332
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:45,833
transformed themselves
into a God and Demon Key,

333
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:50,916
sacrificing their physical
forms to seal Bahamut in Abos.

334
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,500
This stone statue was
carved in remembrance.

335
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,750
Now it's a mecca.
People come here

336
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:59,333
to offer prayers and
achieve inner peace.

337
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:01,125
[FAVARO]
They pray to a monster?

338
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:05,708
Not at all. They pray
to a knight. Up there.

339
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:08,500
A holy knight,
prophesied by the gods.

340
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,500
[FAVARO] And what's
the prophecy?

341
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:13,583
[JEANNE] When Bahamut revives,
a knight of high valor

342
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:17,458
will appear to face the doom,
and restore peace to the land.

343
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:19,166
The citizens of
the royal capital

344
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,666
believe in
this prophecy.

345
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,000
They also believe the
awakening is coming soon,

346
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:24,458
and that I am that knight.

347
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:27,208
It is my earnest hope that
I will not let them down.

348
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:30,958
I pray I can be their promised
savior if that day does come.

349
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:33,541
[FAVARO] Good, then it
has nothing to do with me.

350
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,125
[JEANNE]
Why do you say that?

351
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:36,750
I wound up here
'cause I got mixed up

352
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,666
with a weird demon girl
and I stupidly tried

353
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,291
to play for some action.
The three things I care about

354
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:44,041
are women, freedom, and booze,
and life as a bounty hunter

355
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:46,458
was perfect for me
before I screwed that up.

356
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:48,000
All this stuff
about holy knights

357
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:51,541
and world-ending monsters...
that's a world apart from me.

358
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,000
[JEANNE]
I wouldn't be so sure.

359
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:54,125
Huh?

360
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:55,916
I began my life as
a simple farm girl,

361
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,666
in a small, remote village
you couldn't find on a map.

362
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,958
Despite that humble
start I received the light

363
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:04,416
and revelation of the gods
and was awakened to my mission.

364
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,958
We're all born into
this world for a reason.

365
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:09,000
We're all meant to play a role.

366
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:15,625
And I believe that
yours is a crucial one.

367
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,916
It was no accident
that you met the girl.

368
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,125
Your destiny is
already calling.

369
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:25,666
Destiny, my ass.
Yeah, right.

370
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,958
There's no reason
to any of this.

371
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,750
Who are you? Tell me!

372
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:36,583
Why do you have
the same pendant?

373
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:38,458
[LAVALLEY] I was asked
to keep it safe...

374
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:40,333
by your own mother.

375
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:43,833
By my mother?
Then you know her?

376
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:47,208
Does that mean...?

377
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:50,500
Yeah, my freaking father, okay!
You got one, right?

378
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:55,125
[bell rings, AMIRA gasps]

379
00:21:55,208 --> 00:22:00,166
[bell continues]

380
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,125
[FAVARO]
Great, demons again?

381
00:23:50,916 --> 00:23:52,541
[AZAZEL] Brace
yourselves, humans.

382
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:55,250
The time for fun
and games is over.

383
00:23:56,291 --> 00:23:57,541
[FAVARO]
I love machinery.

384
00:23:57,625 --> 00:23:58,750
My clock sword
is my masterpiece.

385
00:23:58,833 --> 00:23:59,833
[KAISAR] But your
clock's broken!

386
00:23:59,916 --> 00:24:01,041
[FAVARO] Shut up!
What are you into?

387
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:02,500
--[KAISAR] Oh! Uh--
--[FAVARO] Nobody cares!

388
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:04,375
On the next Rage of Bahamut:
Genesis: The Storm Rages!

389
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:06,041
--[KAISAR] I love meat!
--[FAVARO] Good for you.
