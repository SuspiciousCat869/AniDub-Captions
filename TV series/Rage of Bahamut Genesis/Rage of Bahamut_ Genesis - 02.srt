00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:38,666
[FAVARO]
Huh? Y-Yeah.

162
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:42,416
[FAVARO] Trying to kill this
girl might be a bad idea.

163
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,666
At least, if she sees it comin'.

164
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,166
[BACCHUS]
Okay, here's your reward.

165
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,750
Took down a big
one this time,

166
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:52,708
you've impressed me.

167
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:54,666
[FAVARO]
Yeah.

168
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,458
Hey. Look, uh...

169
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:58,583
Stop starin' at me like that?

170
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:00,458
I'm getting nervous.

171
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:03,333
You look tasty.

172
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:04,541
Hands off, sweetie.

173
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:06,125
That's Hamsa the talking duck.

174
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,416
And he's Captain Drunkard's
favorite pet.

175
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,625
Eating him is not allowed!

176
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:11,833
[HAMSA] Stupid, clueless
human, how dare you!

177
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:13,666
I'm not a duck or a pet!

178
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,666
I'm a god! A god, incarnate!

179
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,625
[BACCHUS]
Where you going, Puff Ball Head?

180
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,500
[FAVARO]
Gotta run. See ya, Bacchus!

181
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:20,291
[BACCHUS]
Yeah whatever,

182
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:21,708
[FAVARO]
Just ignore him.

183
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:25,416
[BACCHUS] Hey, close
the door! Damn human...

184
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:29,625
Puff Ball Head's keeping
strange company these days.

185
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:31,625
[FAVARO] We've gotta get
you some new clothes.

186
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:33,708
You smell like a sweaty bandit.

187
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:35,625
[AMIRA]
Well, you smell like that ram.

188

Oh yeah, and who's
fault is that, huh?

189

[FAVARO]
Hm...

[laughs]

191
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:47,416
Uh...

192
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,583
Huh.

193

[FAVARO]
Hm...

00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,166
[AMIRA]
What's in the cup?

196
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,583
This? It's just a little wine.

197
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:17,916
Hey, hey!

[gasps]

199
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:29,000
Ah, it tastes good.

200
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:31,000
Wait, don't tell me
this is the first time

201
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,000
you've ever had wine.

202
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:33,458
Ah...

203
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:35,541
Then you've got some
catching up to do!

204
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:38,916
Hey! More drinks,
keep 'em comin'!

205

[hiccups]

206
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,250
And that's why
I love this town,

207
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:49,916
the drinks can't be beat!

[gasps]

209
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:52,125
What are they doing?

210
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:53,583
That's called dancing.

211
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:56,750
The way they dance in this
town can't be beat, either!

Ah!

[TAVERN PATRONS cheer]

218
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:39,333
[AMIRA laughing] Drinking is
great! And dancing is the best!

219
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:45,208
[AMIRA sighs]
The water feels so good.

220
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:50,208
Hey. You think that's nice?

221
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:54,125
Check out all those stars.
Beautiful, huh?

222
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:02,791
You're right. They are.

223
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:09,916
Gotcha.

224
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:12,583
[FAVARO]
Now's my chance.

225
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,875
If I kill her, I break
the curse for sure.

226
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:18,208
Then it's goodbye, tail!

227
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:23,958
What the--? Of all
the times to mess up!

228
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:25,500
What's messed up?

229
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,750
Oh, uh. Nothing!
Everything's fine!

230
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,958
I just said it's messed up
we've spent all this

231
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:32,041
time together and haven't
introduced ourselves.

232
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:35,208
My name's Favaro. Favaro Leone.

233
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,458
And you are?

234
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,458
I'm Amira.

235
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:43,083
Ah, Amira!

236
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:45,291
A beautiful name for
a beautiful woman!

237
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:47,291
Well, it beats the hell
out of my mom's name,

238
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:48,333
she got stuck with "Bunyon."

239
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:49,833
Bunyon?

240
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,666
So, now that we're
getting familiar,

241
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,458
why do you wanna go
to Helheim, anyway?

242
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:55,125
It's an icy hellhole,
most people

243
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:56,541
would choose any other
town in the world,

244
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:58,500
which would be fine
with me, by the way,

245
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:00,916
if you wanted to
change our deal.

246
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,791
[FAVARO]
Crap, that wasn't smooth.

247
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,750
Did I make her suspicious?

248
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:07,000
I have to reach Helheim.

249
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:10,083
That's where my mother is.

250
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:12,083
Your mother?

251
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:18,500
She has one just like this.
This pendant, I mean.

252
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:21,750
When I hold it, I can
see her, just barely.

253
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:27,458
A memory I've half-forgotten.
The gentle look on her face.

254
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:29,000
My teacher told me,

255
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:32,875
I'd be with her again one day,
as long as I held onto this.

256
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:36,291
So, that's why-- that's why
I have to get to Helheim.

257
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:39,208
I need to see her!

you were a demon!

so we can cover more ground.

It tingled?

320
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:47,416
[GAURIN] Find her, men!
Find the demon!

321
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,416
Don't let her get away!

322
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,958
Okay, whatever--
just come with me!

323
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:05,125
[AMIRA panting]

324
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:07,208
[FAVARO yelps]

325
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,166
That's a problem.

326
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,791
Only a bounty hunter
would have the nerve

327
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:17,750
to scam royal knights.
Now, you will die.

328
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:21,208
Ha! I don't know what
you're talking about!

329
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:22,833
But you'd better not move!

330
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:24,416
[gasps]

331
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,875
[FAVARO] I know, I'm surrounded,
outnumbered, blah, blah, blah.

332
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:27,875
But you don't wanna risk

333
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:29,916
losing your little
treasure, right?

334
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,041
That double-crossing liar!

335
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:33,458
Liar?

336
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:34,916
[FAVARO]
Hey, Amira.

337
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,250
You with me?

338
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:40,250
'Cause I say we take
another dip in the water.

339
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:41,208
Yeah!

340
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:43,166
This is gonna be fun!

341
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:46,458
[growls] You die, now!

342
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:48,583
Wait! Don't shoot!

343
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,000
[FAVARO, AMIRA yelp]

344
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:23,291
[FAVARO panting]

345
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:24,833
That was dumb.

346
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:27,416
Why did I just risk
my neck to save her life?

347
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,625
If I'd stayed out of it,
that damn curse would be broken.

348
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:33,500
And I'd be rid of
this freakshow tail.

349
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,291
[AMIRA]
He called you a liar.

350
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:38,291
Are you? Are you a liar?

351
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:39,458
Forget what he said!

352
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:43,291
Just look into my eyes!
Am I lying?

353
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:45,083
[FAVARO giggles]

354
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:47,125
[slap]

355
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,500
[BACCHUS]
See ya around, Senor Barrettes.

356
00:23:25,291 --> 00:23:26,958
[KAISAR]
Lady Amira.

357
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:30,166
Favaro's made them think
you're an outlaw, too.

358
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:34,083
I'll save you from
that demon. I swear it.

359
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,500
[CERBERUS] Hmm. She doesn't seem
to be in this town anymore.

360
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:45,041
We've gotta track
her down! Arf!

361
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:46,625
Yeah! Grab her
and stab her! Arf!

362
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:50,625
[PAZUZU] No need to rush.
She'll turn up soon enough.

363
00:23:55,916 --> 00:23:58,458
The most important thing
is that we learn the truth.

364
00:23:58,541 --> 00:24:01,291
Where is she taking the God Key?

365
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:03,083
And to whom?

366
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:07,041
[KAISAR]
Favaro!

367
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:08,041
[FAVARO]
Kaisar!

368
00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:09,083
[KAISAR]
Favaro!

369
00:24:09,166 --> 00:24:10,625
[FAVARO]
You're making my ears bleed!

370
00:24:10,708 --> 00:24:13,208
[KAISAR] On the next
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis:

371
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:14,208
Fog of Nebelville!

372
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:15,833
[FAVARO]
Inside voice.
