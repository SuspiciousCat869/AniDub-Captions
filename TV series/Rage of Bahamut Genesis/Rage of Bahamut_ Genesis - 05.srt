1
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:54,583
We must endure!

2
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:56,875
Reinforcement from Heaven
will arrive soon!

3
00:00:56,958 --> 00:00:59,625
But until they do,
the barrier must hold!

4
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:20,125
[ARCHANGEL A]
All this power,

5
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:21,666
and these are
nothing but tremors

6
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,416
from the mere
possibility of revival.

7
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,916
This beast surpasses
gods and demons alike.

8
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,333
If Bahamut should
actually awaken...

9
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:36,458
[ARCHANGEL A] ...what will
happen to the world?

10
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:45,083
Where'd they go?

[FAVARO]
Ow!

14
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:50,583
You're that damn necromancer!

15
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:52,583
[RITA]
That monster's name is Gregor.

16
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:55,333
He's a living, flying
castle for Azazel.

17
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:57,208
Which century did
you learn that one?

18
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:59,125
You know I'm escaping
with you, doncha?

19
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:02,000
[RITA]
Escape? I'm going after them.

20
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:05,500
[groans] You want to chase
a flying beast-castle?

21
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,125
In a dinghy?

22
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:08,125
Are you freaking stu--

00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:11,375
[grunts]

24
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:14,333
[RITA] If you're not planning
to help me, then get lost.

[growls]

26
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:37,833
[FAVARO]
We're talking about a demon girl

27
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:40,625
who put a curse on me, and a
guy who wakes up every morning

28
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:44,708
chanting, "Must kill Favaro."
My life would be a hell of a lot

29
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:46,625
easier without 'em.

30
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,083
Do you want one?

31
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:55,125
So what's the
big plan here, Rita?

32
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,041
I mean, how you gonna chase 'em?

33
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:00,625
You do know rowboats
aren't exactly

34
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:02,416
high-speed transport, don't you?

[sighs]

36
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:11,041
You feel that?

37
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:12,583
Strong wind.

to steal the God Key?!

Who sent you into the Ark?!

43
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:09,958
[PAZUZU]
Answer me!

44
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:12,416
[KAISAR]
Stop, you foul demon!

45
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,833
Torturing a defenseless
girl--have you no shame?!

[AMIRA groans]

47
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:21,666
[PAZUZU] Abandon all
hope of escaping this.

48
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,708
Gregor's poison has
sapped your strength!

[PAZUZU]
Hmph. Not again.

53
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:40,333
Come on, aren't you done yet?

54
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,000
Let us have a turn at her, ARF!

55
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:43,458
Your torture sucks!

56
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:45,625
[BOTH] You need less bark
and more bite, ARF!

57
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:52,791
Maybe she's an ignorant pawn
who doesn't even know her king.

58
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,291
[MALE DOG]
Let us torture her, ARF!

59
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:56,166
[FEMALE DOG] There's all
sorts of things to try, ARF!

60
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,416
Fire and bullwhips!

61
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,625
Stab em with a stick!

62
00:05:58,708 --> 00:05:59,916
[MALE DOG]
Torture chairs and boots!

63

[FEMALE DOG]
Iron maidens!

Hot irons and bone saws!

Neck violins!

68
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:08,125
That does sound
painful! I love it!

69
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:09,875
[KAISAR] How many times
do I have to tell you?!

70
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,666
That girl hasn't done anything!

71
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,333
She was manipulated
by a demon named Favaro!

72
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:15,208
That's it!

73

[AZAZEL]
Priceless, isn't he?

76
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,125
Now you can see why
I've kept him alive.

77
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:24,375
--He's hilarious!

What's so funny?!

Relax, my human plaything.

81
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:33,000
I'll let you in on the truth.
Let's see how you feel

82
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:37,291
after you know what she
really is and what she's done.

84

[BACCHUS]
Funny way to say hello.

85
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,958
What is this, Puff Ball Head?

86
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:52,000
We need you to
lend us your carriage.

87
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:54,458
People ask a god for a
favor with an offering,

88
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:55,750
not a blade at his neck.

89
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,916
I had to make sure
you'd pay attention.

90
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,666
I'll never ask
for anything else.

91
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,375
Please, just hear us out.

92
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:02,541
I don't think so.

00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,500
[BACCHUS] Unless you bring
me some Helheim booze.

95
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,083
I might listen to you then.

96
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:08,791
[FAVARO] If I could go to
Helheim for booze

97
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:10,791
I wouldn't need your help
getting to freaking Helheim!

98
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:12,041
And you owe me!

99
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,583
Your tip about the boats
going there was bogus!

100
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,166
[BACCHUS]
Oh, really?

101
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,291
[FAVARO] Damn it, what kind of
god just screws with people?!

All right!

103
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:20,666
If you want a ride,
let's see you pay the fare.

104
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,083
The fare?

105
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:24,625
[BACCHUS]
The price is conviction.

106
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:26,416
[BACCHUS chuckles]

107
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,208
[BACCHUS] Can you show me
how serious you really are?

YOU IDIOT!

00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:13,833
That was dangerous, damn it!

114
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,375
[RITA]
You're a bore, you know that?

115
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:35,375
You should at least have
chopped off your arm

116
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:37,041
to show him how serious you are.

117
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:38,833
And how would
I play the heroic,

Kids today.

120
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:44,916
[sighs]
This is pathetic.

121
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,083
The great Bacchus
has lost his edge.

122
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:49,166
What's pathetic is your
decision-making, boy!

123
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,458
Now that you've
shattered your bracelet,

124
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:51,791
you're just a common outlaw

125
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,333
and can never go back
to being a bounty hunter!

126
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:53,875
You talk way too much, duck.

[HIMSA screams]

128
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:58,291
So what's your plan?

129

How are you going to
make a living now?

130
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,125
Well, if I live
through this rescue,

00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,208
I'm sure I'll come up
with something.

You sure are a
happy-go-lucky bastard.

133

I'd like to meet the parents
who brought you up.

Humph!

00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,458
I wish you could.

136
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,833
My old man did teach me a lot.

137
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:16,916
[BAROSSA]
Feel that, Favaro?

138

You know which way
the wind is blowing?

139

Toward tomorrow.

Get it?

[RITA]
No. Do you know what he meant?

142

[FAVARO]
No idea.

[KAISAR]
Lady Amira's a traitor?

144
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:38,666
It can't be...

145
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,875
She stole this God Key from...

146

...from Heaven's sacred ground?

147

[AZAZEL] While her actions
could be beneficial to us,

148
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:45,958
we have to be careful.

I can't believe this girl
could have pulled off

150
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,208
such a feat on her own.

151

[PAZUZU] Someone else is pulling
the strings from the shadows!

And we need to know who
so we can plan our next move.

If that's true, then I know the
schemer that you're looking for!

It's that demon Favaro!

I can't believe
I didn't know about him!

161
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:11,708
[CERBERUS]
What a joke!

162
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:14,375
You can laugh out of
ignorance all you want!

163
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:16,000
Till he ruins you!

164
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:19,250
That's right, just like
he ruined me!

165
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:22,041
I thought Favaro Leone
was harmless, too.

166
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:24,958
But he betrayed me and
set a trap for my father!

167
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:28,083
He drove the Lidfard family
into poverty and shame!

168
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:30,250
He's evil!

169
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:33,541
[AZAZEL]
Did you say "Lidfard"?

170
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,708
[grunts]

171
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:36,875
[AZAZEL]
I see.

172
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:40,041
So, you're the son
of Laurus Lidfard.

173
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:41,708
How'd you--?

174
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,833
[AZAZEL]
Which means this Favaro of yours

175
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:46,583
must be the son of
Barossa the thief.

176

Just who in the hell are you?!

180
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:58,500
When your die, you'll have
accomplished nothing.

181
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,833
Exactly like your
pitiful father.

[AZAZEL laughs]

183
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:13,083
[BACCHUS] Azazel is
the right-hand of Lucifer,

184
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:15,083
chief of the fallen angels.

185
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:17,375
There's no question
where he's headed:

186
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:20,291
The demon capital of Cocytus.

187
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:24,416
Far to the west, in a barren
land called Sword Valley,

188
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:28,041
there's a demonic gate
that leads to Cocytus.

189
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:32,375
I'll take you that far, but then
I'm washing my hands of this.

190
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,458
The rest is up to you.

191
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:36,791
Best of luck, Puff ball head.

192
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:39,333
This is the last time
we'll meet.

193
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:43,375
You're light!

194
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:45,125
[RITA]
All zombies are.

195
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:46,375
What's wrong?

196
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:47,833
Ah, nothin'.

197
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:52,125
Here we go!

198
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,333
I still can't believe
I'm in this mess.

199
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:00,875
[FAVARO]
This is all her fault.

200
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:05,666
Never should've
asked her to kiss meeee!

Just hold on.

205
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,041
I'll save you and
these demons will pay.

206
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:21,833
I swear it.

207
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:34,791
[CERBERUS] Are you sure we
should be relaxing out here?

208
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:36,000
[FEMALE DOG]
What about torture?

209
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:38,291
[FEMALE, MALE DOG]
We're happy to try!

210
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:39,958
After all, we still
haven't gotten

211
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:41,958
a lick of information
out of her yet.

212

It doesn't matter.

213
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,625
Even if we don't learn
who she's allied with,

214
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:47,208
we have possession
of her body

215
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:49,375
and that means
we have the God Key.

216
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:51,583
There's no reason to brood.

You know what to do.

Are you sure we're going the
right way in this maze?

221
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:07,458
[RITA] I'd say so,
judging by the smell.

222
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:09,208

[RITA]
You never told me.

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,166
Why'd you decide to save them?

226
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,625

Beats me!

[CERBERUS]
I'm surprised.

How'd they even get on board?

00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,416
[PAZUZU]
They're like rats on a ship.

I'll take care of them myself.

[AZAZEL]
Well, I think it's amusing.

233

It's what makes humans
so enjoyable.

The opportunity to avenge
the father you loved so much.

him, and got his father killed.

And yet here you are
risking your life to save him.

Even though he still
wants to kill you.

00:17:58,208 --> 00:18:00,916
[LAVALLEY]
Archers! Release!

320
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:15,125
[LAVALLEY]
Dragon Knights! Take flight!

321
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:20,583
[LAVALLEY] Find the one-winged
demon, and bring her to us!

322
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:23,958
[LAVALLEY] Catapults and
sorcerer divisions,

323
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:27,625
fire at will to give the
Dragon Knights sustained cover!

324
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:29,875
Keep those wyverns at bay!

325
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:35,250
Sounds like some
serious action out there.

326
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:37,166
Would you two hurry up?

327
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,750
[PAZUZU growls]

328
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:42,375
[FAVARO] Aw, damn,
he's a big one!

329
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:45,208
[PAZUZU]
Playtime's over, human scum.

330
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,041
[PAZUZU]
What?! Where is she?

331
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:52,208
Miserable wretches!
Where did you hide the girl?!

332
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:53,666
[gasps]

333
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:00,916
Hey, Kaisar.

334
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,250
Help me, just this once.

335
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,708
What? Some nerve!
You actually think that I'd--

336
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:06,041
[FAVARO] You wanna
save Amira or not?

337
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,458
Huh?

338
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:09,458
And as soon as we get
out of this flying horror show,

339
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:13,375
we can settle things between us
once and for all, okay?

340
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:15,250
I won't run this time.

341
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:17,416
I promise.

342
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,875
[KAISAR] You'd better not
forget those words.

343
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:24,208
[PAZUZU sniffs]
There you are.

344
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:28,458
[FAVARO, KAISAR yell]

345
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:32,208
[FAVARO grunts]

346
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:34,958
[PAZUZU]
You dare challenge me?!

347
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,375
Goodnight, you ugly
son of a bitch!

348
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:44,166
[PAZUZU grunts]

349
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:47,791
[PAZUZU] You lowly,
bottom-feeding worm!

350
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:01,000
It looks like we're not
out of the fire yet.

351
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,958
[AZAZEL]
That's far enough.

352
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:05,958
I'm afraid I can't
let you take the girl.

353
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,375
[RITA]
Azazel.

354
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:12,250
Don't tell me...

355
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:20,916
[AZAZEL chuckles]

356
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:28,208
Can't be... No...

357
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:32,750
[AMIRA grunts]

358
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:33,750
Amira!

359
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,208
Leave her alone!

360
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:41,708
Now then.

361
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:43,291
Come to me.

362
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:46,541
[AZAZEL grunts]

363
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,708
[AZAZEL]
I see.

364
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:56,791
So that explains it.

365
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:02,958
[RITA] Does anyone have
a clue what that was?

366
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:09,875
O, Michael, angel of war!

367
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:13,625
Bless this holy spear of Maltet
with thy heavenly grace!

368
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:30,291
[FAVARO]
Nice one, Rita!

369
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:32,333
I didn't know you could
control one of these puppies!

370
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,083
[RITA]
As long as they're dead.

371
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:36,291
Don't move her.

372
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:38,750
It'll take time for
the poison to wear off.

373
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:41,833
[KAISAR] Those flags--
They're the Orléans Knights!

374
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:44,291
Favaro, don't tell me
you sent for them!

375
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:45,875
[FAVARO]
'Course not.

376
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:48,458
The wind just happened
to blow our way.

377
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,541
The wind?

378
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:53,375
[chuckles]

379
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:56,458
[FAVARO]
Yeah. The wind of tomorrow.

380
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:58,166
[AMIRA] I shopped on my own
for the first time.

381
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,000
[RITA]
What'd you buy?

382
00:23:59,083 --> 00:23:59,791
[AMIRA]
Meat.

383
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:01,041
[RITA]
Meat?

384
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:02,541
[BOTH] On the next Rage of
Bahamut: Genesis:

385
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:03,583
Legendary Saint.

386
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:04,791
[AMIRA]
I'm sure you eat meat.

387
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:05,875
[RITA]
Is that a zombie joke?
