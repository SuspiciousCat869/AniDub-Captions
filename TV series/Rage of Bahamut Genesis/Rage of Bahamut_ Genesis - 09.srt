162
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:45,125
[MARTINET] Wouldn't you
like to know the truth?

163
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:46,916
The truth the gods
are hiding from you

164
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,916
and all the other
pitiable sheep?

165
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,500
Drink this elixir.

166
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:54,916
It will lift the veil and show
you the world as it truly is.

167
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,666
I will not listen to the
filthy words of a demon!

168
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:02,083
[MARTINET] All right, all right.
No pressure, of course!

169
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:05,375
Unlike those puppeteer gods,
I respect you,

170
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:08,333
and I want you to make
your own decisions.

171
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:11,416
But let me leave you
with a little advice.

172
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,000
No matter how much you suffer,
no matter the depths

173
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,458
of your agony, or the
shrillness of your screams,

174
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:20,000
don't expect your "merciful"
guardian angel to save you.

175
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:23,125
Because he won't! He won't!

What was that? Where'd they go?

178
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:38,041
What sort of place is this?

179

--[SOLDIER 9E] Retreat!
--[KAISAR] Wait!

180

[KAISAR] Can't you see me?
I'm right here! Help us!

181
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:48,791
Oh, great.

182
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,625
Well, that's hired
help for you, right?

183
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:52,916
Can't be trusted.

What's that?

187
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:05,666
[FAVARO]
You got me.

Okay, why not.

195
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:29,541
I don't even know why
we're doing this,

196
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:32,125
and there's no way
I can pull it ou--

197
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:35,375
Uh? I'll be damned.

198
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:38,500
Don't be sad, most people
are wimps compared to me.

199
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,791
Hey. What's wrong?

200
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:43,166
Now, don't get hostile.
That was only a joke.

[FAVARO gasps]

205
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:59,791
[FAVARO yelps]
Dangit.

206
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:06,000
[FOREST DRAGON] I feel so much
better without that barb in me.

207
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,083
[FAVARO]
A barb?

208
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:07,875
[FOREST DRAGON]
It's been bothering me

209
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:10,875
for the last 2,000 years.

210
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:11,875
Who is this geezer?

211
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,958
You should probably be polite.

212
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:16,416
Who are you, uh, geezer, sir?

213
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,875
[FOREST DRAGON]
I am a dragon.

214
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:20,750
[FAVARO, KAISAR, AMIRA]
We knew that.

215
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:23,500
[FOREST DRAGON] What you pulled
from me has a great power.

216
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,208
So we're skipping
introductions, huh?

217
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:27,875
[FOREST DRAGON] It is a
barb from Bahamut itself.

218
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:29,458
Wow. Really?

219
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,541
[FOREST DRAGON]
All those passing centuries,

220
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:34,666
yet it was never
removed until now.

221
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:38,208
It seems it was fated
to guide you here.

222
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:39,875
That's crazy.

223
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:43,083
[FOREST DRAGON]
Bahamut has appeared many times,

224
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:46,000
over the long span of existence.

225
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:50,625
And each occurrence brought
death and ruin to the world.

226
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,166
Its last appearance

227
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:56,416
was around 2,000 years ago.
That time, in what could only

228
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,625
be called a miracle,
the gods and demons

229
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,833
allied to seal Bahamut,

230
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:05,291
thus preventing
a greater destruction.

231
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:06,791
It was in that moment

232
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:09,708
that this barb
lodged in my foot.

233
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:12,791
It tore through the very
fabric of space-time,

234
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:16,000
and reached me in
this alternate plane.

235
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:20,083
Bahamut's power is
like nothing else.

236
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:21,625
The world has been spared

237
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:25,041
the destroyer's wrath all
this time, but now Bahamut

238
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:29,125
is on the verge of awakening,
and wreaking havoc once again.

239
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:32,541
And it is this young girl
who would unseal it.

240
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,541
[KAISAR]
Then you know about Lady Amira?

241
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,000
[FOREST DRAGON]
Indeed I do.

242
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:39,083
I am an eternal
observer, after all.

243
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:43,291
She is now half the Key,
and will soon become the whole.

244
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:44,625
[AMIRA gasps]

245
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:46,500
[FOREST DRAGON] If the
completed Transcendent Key

246
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:49,625
and the seal are brought
together, Bahamut will awaken

247
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:54,083
and destroy the world, just as
it has so many times before.

248
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:55,458
We won't let that happen.

249
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:56,500
[FOREST DRAGON]
The gods and demons

250
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:58,916
are amassing forces as we speak.

251
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,375
Destruction has a
momentum of its own.

252
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:07,750
[GABRIEL]
The humans have failed us.

253
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:09,208
They have lost the Key.

254
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:11,458
If the girl reaches
her demon allies,

255
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,041
I'm convinced they'll
march on Abos

256
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:16,416
and put the whole world at risk!
Heroic warriors of light!

257
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:20,208
We cannot let this happen!
Prepare yourselves for battle!

258
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:24,875
[BEEZLEBUB] The God Key
has left the human city!

259
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:27,750
The scheming angels have
decided our damnation

260
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:30,250
is not enough, and they
plan to use Bahamut

261
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:32,166
to destroy us completely!

262
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:35,625
My fallen brothers and
sisters of the darkness!

263
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:38,250
We must take up our
swords and fight!

264
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:42,500
What exactly are you
scheming, Beezlebub?

265
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:45,666
[BEEZLEBUB] This time, when the
gods try to crush us under foot,

266
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,541
they will find they are
stepping on our blades!

267
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:52,875
So, we're doomed?

268
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:54,458
Relax would'ja?

269
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:57,583
Any back-alley fortuneteller can
predict the end of the world.

270
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,750
[FOREST DRAGON]
Destruction is your fate.

271
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,916
And fate cannot be changed.

272
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,541
[gasps]

273
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:04,875
Favaro, what is it?

274
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:07,250
It's nothing, okay?

275
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:10,791
[AMIRA] So the whole world's
going to be ruined,

276
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:15,625
because of me?
Everyone's going to die?

277
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,208
[FOREST DRAGON]
Yes.

278
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:20,791
And my mother, too?

279
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:22,791
[FOREST DRAGON]
No one will remain.

280
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:25,416
[AMIRA whimpers]

281
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:30,458
[FOREST DRAGON]
But it was also fate

282
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:33,041
that you stumbled
into this place.

283
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:36,166
And so, there may be one way
to prevent your lives

284
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:39,500
from unfolding down
their destructive path.

285
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,208
You mean it?

286
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,833
[FOREST DRAGON]
You can remove yourselves

287
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:45,333
from your own destinies,
by remaining

288
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:49,791
in this separate plain
of existence, forever.

289
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:56,750
Live here? For good?

290
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:59,250
But, if I do that,
then what about my mother?

291
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:02,375
[FOREST DRAGON sighs]

292
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:04,750
How will I ever see her?

[sobbing]

299

[FAVARO]
Okay, screw this.

300
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:38,500
[FAVARO]
Listen, dragon.

301
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:41,875
I say to hell with fate!

302
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:44,666
[FOREST DRAGON growls]

303
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:45,875
Easy.

304
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,333
I didn't go through
all this for nothing,

305
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:50,833
we're too close to finding
your mom to give up, Amira.

306
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:54,833
If I go on, then
she'll die. He said so!

307
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:57,291
[FAVARO] Forget that!
These are our lives!

308
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,833
We call the shots!

309
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:01,375
Listen up, you wrinkly lizard!

310
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:04,291
I'm tired of all
this destiny crap!

311
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,250
We can change our
so-called fate.

312
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:10,041
Whenever and however
we want! You got that?

313
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:11,083
We can change it?

314
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:13,291
[FAVARO]
Of course! And we will.

315
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,916
Our future's not
written in stone,

316
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,333
it can change like
the breeze. Ha!

317
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:20,125
That's what my old man
meant all along.

[BAROSSA]
Feel that, Favaro?

319
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,083
Know which way the
wind is blowing?

320
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:26,125
Toward tomorrow!

321
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:28,875
[FAVARO]
Heh.

322
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:32,916
[FOREST DRAGON]
My word.

323
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,333
That actually worked.

324
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:36,000
[AMIRA]
Fava!

325
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:39,000
Favaro. For once,
I agree with you.

326
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:40,750
I couldn't have said it better.

327
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:44,875
[FOREST DRAGON laughs]
You surprise me, young human.

328
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,083
That was wonderful!

329
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,875
[FAVARO] There I go
being impulsive again.

330
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:50,125
Hope I don't regret it.

331
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:51,750
[FOREST DRAGON]
I understand.

332
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:54,333
Now go forth,
and meet your future.

333
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:55,958
[AMIRA]
You won't stop us?

334
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:58,625
[FOREST DRAGON] I am only
an observer, nothing more.

335
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:01,416
It is not my place to stop you.

336
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,250
Take that barb of
Bahamut with you.

337
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:07,208
If it can tear through
the planes of reality,

338
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:10,666
perhaps it can tear
through fate, as well.

339
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:15,666
Well, thanks for your
help, ya old bastard!

340
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:19,291
We won't forget you, Mr. Geezer!

341
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:21,833
We'll make you proud.
Oh, great one.

342
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:30,583
[FOREST DRAGON] You and I have
more to discuss, bold knight.

343
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:32,166
[CITIZEN 9A] Saint Jeanne is
being burned at the stake?

344
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,333
[CITIZEN 9B]
But that's madness!

345
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:34,666
[CITIZEN 9C]
Can't possibly be a traitor!

346
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:37,333
She's the Holy Knight!
She's supposed to save us!

347
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:38,916
[SOLDIER 9B]
Shut up, all of you!

348
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,375
Oppose the king's decree, and
you can burn right next to her!

349
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,333
Huh?

350
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:47,166
[BACCHUS]
Hm?

351
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,083
[burps]

352
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:49,708
Gross!

353
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:54,166
Please have mercy, Your Majesty.

354
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,833
This must be a mistake.
She would never act against you.

355
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:58,708
[CHARIOCE]
Silence!

356
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:00,375
From now on, anyone who praises

357
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:03,541
that witch is a traitor!
Seize every last one of them!

358
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:06,750
And if they don't recant,
then kill them, too!

359
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:14,416
I'm in.

360
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,916
[RITA]
Fungus, Foxglove, mandrake root.

361
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,541
Cockatrice gizzard?
Basilisk heart?

362
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:25,833
[RITA] These are pretty
shady ingredients

363
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:28,625
to be stockpiling
in a royal castle.

364
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:35,208
[RITA]
Hm?

365
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,958
Someone's been
performing magic here.

366
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:42,041
And it looks like
a powerful spell.

367
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:44,708
[MARTINET]
Looking for something, madam?

368
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:48,916
[MARTINET]
Too bad for you.

369
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:57,875
This is it? The place
where my mother lives?

370
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,333
[KAISAR]
Prudisia.

371
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:05,041
What's the matter, Favaro?
Losing your nerve?

372
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:06,875
[AMIRA]
Don't worry. I'm strong!

373
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:09,083
[KAISAR]
You certainly are.

374
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:13,083
[FOREST DRAGON] You and I have
more to discuss, bold knight.

375
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:15,708
As long as the girl
is the Key's vessel,

376
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:19,208
the miracle of 2,000
years ago cannot repeat.

377
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,708
What? What's that mean?

378
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:25,000
[FOREST DRAGON] Zeus and Satan
now exist only as Keys.

379
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,333
Bahamut's seal has
become unstable,

380
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:28,791
the god and demon lords

381
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:31,875
must be restored to their
bodies to seal the creature.

382
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:35,166
But only the blood of a
human vessel can restore them.

383
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,375
Since the girl has
no human blood,

384
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:39,041
she cannot make this happen.

385
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:40,250
Well, that's great.

386
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:42,083
So 'cause she's a god
and demon halfbreed,

387
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:44,416
she could steal the Key, but she
can't use it the right way?

388
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,833
[FOREST DRAGON]
Correct.

389
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:48,291
And if the Transendent Key
and Bahamut come together

390
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:52,083
with that girl as the vessel,
they will be permanently joined.

391
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:56,666
Zeus and Satan will be lost, and
a new seal will be impossible.

392
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,333
That much is certain.

393
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:00,958
So how come you're
tellin' me all this?

394
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:02,958
[FOREST DRAGON growls]

395
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:04,458
[FOREST DRAGON]
You're the one who's convinced

396
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:08,333
he can change his fate.
So you need to know the facts.

397
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:10,583
If you truly want
to stop Bahamut,

398
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:12,250
and the world's destruction...

399
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:15,583
Hey! Can you hear me,
Mother? I made it!

400
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:17,916
I'll be there soon!

401
00:22:19,416 --> 00:22:20,916
[FAVARO gasps]

402
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,666
[FOREST DRAGON]
You must kill the girl.

403
00:23:56,333 --> 00:23:57,041
[LUCIFER]
I'm Lucifer.

404
00:23:57,125 --> 00:23:58,500
[AZAZEL]
I'm Azazel.

405
00:23:58,583 --> 00:23:59,500
[LUCIFER, AZAZEL] And we're
the Fallen Angel Brothers!

406
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:00,583
[LUCIFER]
But I'm still your boss.

407
00:24:00,666 --> 00:24:01,666
[AZAZEL]
I love your feathers.

408
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,166
[LUCIFER]
Don't change the subject.

409
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,458
[LUCIFER, AZAZEL] On the next
Rage of Bahamut: Genesis:

410
00:24:04,541 --> 00:24:05,916
Helheim, Land of Lies.
