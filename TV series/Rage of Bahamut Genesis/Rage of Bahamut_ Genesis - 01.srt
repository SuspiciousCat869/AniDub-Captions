a monumental pain in the--

317
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:16,333
Uh. What?

318
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:17,333
[GHOS GIRL laughs]

319
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:17,916
Who're you?

320
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,250
The name's Ghos.

321
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:20,833
And you're gonna suffer
for what you did

322
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:21,791
to my kid brother, Garth!

323
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:25,083
Ghos? Kid brother? Hang on.

324
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:29,791
Oh, I get it!

325
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:32,500
So that's why Bacchus only
paid me half of the bounty!

326
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:33,958
Listen.

327
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:36,166
I don't have time for this,
just tell me the way to--

328
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,916
Hold your horses, honey.

329
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,458
I gotta take care of some
unfinished business here.

330
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,541
And then, we'll get
back to that kiss.

331
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:45,166
Fool! The only thing
you'll be kissing...

332
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,333
...is your ass goodbye!

333
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:59,291
[roars]

334
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:03,250
You're joking, right?

335
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,166
You think you can scare me
with that puny thing?

336
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:08,541
Your kid brother could
summon way better than...

337
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:13,000
Nevermind!

338
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:16,125
Tear him apart,
one limb at a time!

339
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:18,416
[FAVARO grunting]

340
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:23,208
You got some serious
power there, bud!

341
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:25,375
You should get work
as a castle crusher!

[FAVARO grunts]

348
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,291
Big bastard.

349
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:48,791
[FAVARO]
My sword!

350
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:53,625
[FAVARO] Run, you idiot!
You'll get killed!

351
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:55,708
You can't be my guide
if you're dead.

352
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:57,208
[FAVARO]
Huh?

353
00:17:57,291 --> 00:18:01,375
[AMIRA] Stay back and find
some cover. I'll handle this.

354
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:07,208

The hell?

357
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:35,958
[gasps] She's a demon?

Huh?

[gasps, groans]

361
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:10,916
Tch.

362
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,083
[GHOS groans]
You bastard. You fight dirty.

363
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:21,666
Making that mountain-sized
demon look tiny

364
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,458
at first was a way
dirtier trick, in my book.

365
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:27,375
So. You two come as a package?

366
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,500
[GHOS GIRLS gasp, scream]

367
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:32,583
Aw, come on, I haven't
done anything yet!

368
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:44,083
[FAVARO]
Ugh. That was close.

369
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:45,916
[FAVARO groans]

370
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,916
Spoke too soon.

371
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:58,708
[FAVARO pants]
A demon?

372

[FAVARO chuckles]

Seein' things.

374
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,083
This is where I realize
I have a drinking problem.

Jeez. Crazy dream.

380
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:15,416
Oh. You're finally up.
About time.

381
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,958
[FAVARO]
Where am I?

382
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:18,750
[TAVERN GIRL 1A]
You're in the tavern's attic.

383
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:21,125
Found you on the ground outside.

384
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:24,875
Hauling you up here was no
easy task, I'll have you know.

385
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:26,375
Don't you remember?

386
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:28,541
Huh...

387
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:30,166
Oh...

388
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,208
Heh. I guess I had too much
of that ale and blacked out.

389
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:36,125
Had some weird dreams, too.

390
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:38,083
Well, I ran a bath
for you, earlier.

391
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:39,708
You should splash water
on your face.

392
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:41,208
Yeah, thanks.

393
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:43,916
Maybe I'll wash the rest
of me while I'm at it.

[FAVARO] Not the reaction
I usually get, but uh.

397
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:01,666
Heh. I'll take it.

398
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,666
[TAVERN GIRL 1A]
That's... That's a tail!

Wow. Uh, thanks, I guess?

[screams] Demon!

401
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,416
Huh? A demon?

402
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,458
Where? Where?

403
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:13,416
Uh--

Hey, Kaisar, know what's bad?

[KAISAR]
What's bad?

407
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,541
[FAVARO] I've gotta read
the next episode title

408
00:23:59,625 --> 00:24:00,625
and I don't think
there's enough time!

409
00:24:00,708 --> 00:24:01,791
[KAISAR]
Well, you're wasting time, now!

410
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:03,083
[FAVARO]
Right!

Rage of Bahamut: Genesis:
Escape From Livian!

412
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:05,916
[KAISAR]
That wasn't hard at all.
