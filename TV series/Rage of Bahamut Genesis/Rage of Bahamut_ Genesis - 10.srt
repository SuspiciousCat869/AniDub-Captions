00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:39,083
[MARTINET]
Looking for something, Madam?

2
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:41,333
Too bad for you.

3
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,875
[RITA] Don't worry about me.
I was just about to leave.

4
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:46,833
[MARTINET] Ha. As if I'd
let you leave here alive.

5
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:48,833
[RITA] You don't have to
worry about that, either.

6
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:50,958
I mean, since I am a zombie.

7
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:54,708
[MARTINET] Oh really? So the
nosy girl already died?

8
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:56,208
Well then.

9
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:59,083
Perhaps I'll slice her up
and add her to my collection.

10
00:01:06,791 --> 00:01:08,125

[AMIRA giggles]

13
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:55,958
He said she'll
recognize me if we hug!

14
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:57,208
What?

15
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:58,750
He said she'll know
that I'm her daughter.

16
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:03,541
because it's a special power
all mothers have! Right, Fava?

17
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,708
Yeah. That's what Fava told you.

18
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:07,791
I'm so excited to see her!

19
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:09,166
I hope we find her soon!

20
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,875
Never fear, my lady.

21
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:13,291
I'm on the job. And trust me,

22
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:16,291
ahe's very close and we'll
get there before you know it,

23
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:17,666
and when we do...

24
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,291
Then we can change our fate!

25
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:20,750
Favaro.

26
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,916
You're the one who opened
our eyes to this path.

27
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You opened our eyes, yeah!

28
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:26,125
Right.

29
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:29,041
It's more like I
opened my big mouth.

30
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,416
[FOREST DRAGON] If you truly
want to stop Bahamut,

31
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,625
and the world's destruction.

32
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:36,041
You must kill the girl.

33
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:39,541
[FAVARO] Can't someone
give me a break, for once?

34
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:41,416
Why's it gotta be me?

35
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,291
[CITIZENS shouting]

36
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:45,666
[CITIZEN 10B]
This has to be a mistake!

37
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:50,875
[CHARIOCE]
People of Anatae!

38
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:54,125
This woman bound before
you is not a saint!

39
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,458
She is an agent of
darkness and evil.

40
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:58,500
bent on destroying this kingdom!

41
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,500
She is a serpent
in human guise!

42
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:02,375
She has infiltrated
the capital...

43
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:05,333
It's hard to tell if the
man's a heretic or a fool.

44
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:07,541
[CHARIOCE] We must act!
As king of this land,

45
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:09,708
I hereby sentence
Joan D'Arc the witch

46
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:13,375
to be burned at the
stake for her sins!

47
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:15,458
[CITIZEN 10C]
Stop! Jeanne isn't a witch!

48
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:17,875
[CITIZEN 10D] She's our
savior! The Holy Knight!

49
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:21,291
In these purifying flames
may your sins be atoned.

50
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:25,500
In the name of the Holy Spirit,
may your soul be cleansed.

51
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:28,333
[CITIZENS scream]

[CITIZENS shouting]

53
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:36,458
They defy their holy king?

54
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:39,791
Any person who sides with that
witch is a coconspirator!

55
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:42,500
Kill them! Crush the rebellion!

56
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:46,041
What is the king doing?

57
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:50,291
[JEANNE]
Gods in heaven, stop this!

58
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:54,166
All these innocent lives.
How can you let this happen?

59
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:57,250
Why aren't you protecting
the people you claim to love?

60
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,666
[JEANNE]
Why, Gods?

61
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,541
[GABRIEL] A Holy Knight
is an offering to the gods,

62
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:06,333
nothing more.

63
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:09,250
[URIEL] We only wanted you as
a vessel to bring back Zeus,

64
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:10,791
then we would throw you away.

65
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:13,541
[RAPHAEL] Humans are only pawns
to be used for our purposes,

66
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,041
your little lives
mean nothing to us.

67
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:17,583
No! But we worship you!

68
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:19,833
[MICHAEL]
Don't delude yourself, Jeanne.

69
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:23,916
The gods have no love
for humans whatsoever.

70
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:30,375
[JEANNE screams]

71
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:40,458
It's time you accept the
world as it actually is.

72
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:44,083
If you want salvation
for your fellow humans,

73
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:46,541
you'll have to take it by force.

slay that monster!

Look at that.

00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,250
The saint went and
turned into a demon.

85
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:07,875
[RITA] So, any chance
you're marginally sober?

86
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:09,375
[BACCHUS]
It's you again.

87
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:13,125
Yeah, me. And I've got
another favor to ask you.

88
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:18,708
[FAVARO]
That'll do. I hope.

89
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:21,791
Considering the barb's power,
that should make quite a weapon.

90
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:25,458
Heh... This place feels dead.

91
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:26,958
You sure we're
goin' the right way?

92
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:29,958
[KAISAR] Of course I'm sure.
I'm following this compass.

00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:32,875
Lady Amira's mother
should be very close.

Just hang on!

[FAVARO yelps]

99
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:54,458
What's your little
compass say about this?

100
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:24,541
[KAISAR] Everything's changed!
What is this place?

101
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,041
[FAVARO]
That fog!

102
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:28,541
It must've been just like
that stuff in Nebelville!

103
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:30,416
[MARTINET]
Can you hear it?

104
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,666
That beautiful moaning
in the wind?

105
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:37,375
It's the voice of the
Demon Key crying out

106
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:40,916
to fulfill its purpose
and become one with you now.

107
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,625
Amira.

108
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:51,583
[BACCHUS] Hm. A spell that
turns humans into demons?

109
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:53,625
[RITA] That's what happened
to Jeanne D'Arc at the stake,

110
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:55,458
you saw it for yourself.

111
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:59,333
I've seen humans make pacts with
demons to get magic powers.

112
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:00,791
But this...

113
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,625
You've been around
a long time, you ever

114
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:07,333
heard of a human, who was turned
into a full-fledged demon?

115
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:09,583
Now that you mention it,
there are rumors.

116
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:11,625
Some claim there's
a guy with a bounty

117
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:13,666
who mastered a spell
that can do that.

118
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,916
[RITA]
A bounty?

119
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,833
Yeah. No one knows if
he's a human or a demon.

120
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:22,833
But the rumors all agree:
he's obsessed with death.

121
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:24,666
He can change his
appearance at will,

122
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,125
and he's an expert
at manipulating others.

123
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,708
He's left a mountain
of corpses in his wake.

124
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:32,000
But his most fearsome
power of all...

125
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:34,791
...is a spell that
turns men into demons?

126
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:37,083
[BACCHUS] Yeah, but like
I said, they're rumors.

127
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:39,791
As the story goes, no one's
ever met him and survived

128
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:41,375
which makes it hard to verify.

129
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:43,458
So, does this
ghost-story-bounty man

130
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,333
have a name?

131
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,583
Yeah. Word is he calls himself--

[HAMSA, BACCHUS yelp]

you're goin', dumbass!

What is he doing here?

137
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:17,791
Teacher?

138
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:19,458
My teacher told me

139
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:23,458
I'd be with her again one day,
as long as I held onto this.

140
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,041
[FAVARO]
That's the guy?

141
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,666
[MARTINET] I've been
waiting for you, Amira.

142
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,375
Somewhat impatiently, to be
honest. Right here, in--

143
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:33,375
H-E-L-heim.

144
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:35,541
What? Helheim?

145
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:37,041
So you are joking, right?

146
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,250
That can't be true!

147
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:40,500
We followed the compass
the whole way here.

148
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:43,541
It's been leading us
straight to Prudisia!

Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

Just because it was
pretty and glowed?

152
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,375
The fact is you've
been heading here

153
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:54,333
from the moment you
stepped out of Anatae!

you talking about?

00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:14,916
who shall rule the world!

160
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,083
Since the Demon Lord Satan
is about to be gone forever,

161
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:21,083
he will soon lay claim
to the Demon Throne,

162
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:25,083
and be crowned Lord Beelzebub!

163
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,208
[KAISAR]
Beezlebub?

164
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:36,666
[KAISAR grunts]

165
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,875
What the hell is this?
I can't move!

166
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:45,208
Amira. It is time to
fulfill your purpose.

167
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:48,916
As an instrument for
breaking Bahamut's seal.

168
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,375
Sorry, but no.

169
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:53,416
Oh?

170
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,791
[AMIRA]
I've made up my mind.

171
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:57,500
I'm going to change our fate!

172
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:00,083
I'm taking my mother
and leaving this place!

173
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:01,750
She's going to take
the key out of me

174
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:03,583
and then we'll be happy again!

175
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:08,208
[MARTINET] Hm. That's an
interesting idea. Yes.

176
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:11,000
Why don't you try
asking her right now?

177
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,291
[gasps]

178
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:21,625
[MARTINET] Dear Mother and
daughter, reunited at last.

179
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:25,791
[yells]

180
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:28,166
[pants]

181
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:31,166
[RITA]
Oh. You did survive.

182
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,000
[AZAZEL]
Necromancer Rita.

183
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:34,375
I'm a zombie now.

184
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:37,791
[BACCHUS]
I'm warning you to behave.

185
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:40,208
If you try anything
funny in here,

186
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:42,791
we'll finish you for good.

187
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:46,291
What are you playing at?
Why bother dragging me in here?

188
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,666
We have some questions
to ask you, that's all.

189
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,875
[AZAZEL]
And you're stupid enough

190
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:51,541
to think I'll answer them?

191
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,291
It might be in your interest.

192
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,000
It's about the people
behind this plot

193
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:57,000
with Amira and the God Key.

194
00:12:57,083 --> 00:13:00,041
And I get the sense you've
been left out of the party.

195
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:09,708
[AMIRA]
Mother? Are you okay?

196
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:17,125
[MARTINET]
Go on, what are you waiting for?

197
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:22,166
Go to her! Isn't that
what you want?

198
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,666
I thought you missed her
with all of your heart!

199
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,583
[KAISAR]
Is that really her?

200
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:29,208
Prob'ly. They sure
do look alike.

201
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:30,541
Oh!

202
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:32,791
Perhaps you're worried
it's too good to be true!

203
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:37,208
Well let me reassure you.
She is the real deal.

204
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:47,958
[MARTINET]
That's it, don't be shy!

205
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:49,916
Let the reunion commence!

206
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,291
What is this?

207
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:54,333
He's clearly playing her
but I can't figure out why.

208
00:13:57,166 --> 00:14:00,250
[AMIRA]
Can you hear me? Mom?

209
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:05,500
Say something. I need to
know if it's really you.

210
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:11,625
Please, answer me. Mom?

211
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:15,625
[screams]

212
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:24,416
What's wrong? Don't...
Don't you want to see me?

213
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:30,041
[cackles] Why the frown,
Amira? Are you surprised?

214
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:32,458
Is this not the fairytale
reunion you expected

215
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:34,916
after going through so much
trouble to get here?

216
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,791
Go on, ask her
to remove the Key!

217
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,625
Ask the woman who despises you

218
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:42,041
more than anything
else in existence!

219
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:44,041
No, you're lying!

220
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:47,125
I know you are,
because I remember.

221
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:50,125
My mother loved me!
I know she...

222
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:51,791
[AMIRA gasps]

223
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,125
[AMIRA gasps]

224
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:25,875
Now you've seen
what really happened.

225
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,541
You weren't born
from that angel.

226
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,333
You were extracted.

227
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:31,791
Like a parasite,
you bored into her soul

228
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:33,750
and ripped out the
parts we needed.

229
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,541
If anyone is responsible
for your birth,

230
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:39,166
it's the great
Beelzebub, not her.

231
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,083
Liar.

232
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:41,000
[MARTINET]
And that pendant.

233
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:42,500
No!

234
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:43,791
[MARTINET] You know why it
helped you remember your mother?

235
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,791
Because that's what
I designed it to do!

236
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,291
No--

237
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:48,791
[MARTINET] I used magic to
implant those memories in it --

238
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:52,666
all false, of course -- and it's
been feeding them to you!

239
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,833
Liar.

240
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:55,333
Though I have to admit, I hoped

241
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:56,916
it would do the trick
but I never dreamed

242
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,333
it would work that well.

243
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:01,125
I mean you ate those memories
like candy, didn't you!

244
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:04,750
You liar, you liar,
you liar, you liar, you liar!

245
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,458
If you're interested
I'd be happy to create

246
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:08,333
more memories for you to enjoy.

247
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:10,125
I consider myself
something of an artist

248
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:13,750
and I just love it when
someone appreciates my work!

249
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:20,208
[gasps]

250
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:23,125
[AMIRA]
Liar!

251
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:25,416
Heartless monster!

252
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:30,666
[KAISAR screaming]

253
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,166
You bastards!

254
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,833
[MARTINET] Truth is, you're
not really a person at all.

255
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:38,916
You're a tool we created.
A means to an end, nothing more!

256
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,958
You're the vessel for
the Transcendent Key

257
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,500
that will soon revive Bahamut!

258
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:45,541
Transcendent Key...
That's what this is all about.

259
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:48,500
[AMIRA]
I'll hug her.

260
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:50,041
[gasps]

261
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:54,791
[AMIRA]
That's all I have to do...

262
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,541
And then she'll know.

263
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:58,416
[gasps]

264
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,541
She'll know that I'm hers.

265
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:03,083
'Cause that's how
mothers are, right?

266
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,041
Don't do it.

267
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:26,291
Amira! No! It's
a trap! Stay away!

268
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:29,500
[screams]

269
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
[yells]

270
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:34,083
[NICOLE]
Amira.

271
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,541
Mother?

272
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,750
[gasps]

273
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:50,041
[AMIRA]
Mother!

274
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:06,416
[gasping]

275
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:14,666
Amira!

276
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:21,000
[screams]

277
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,625
[gasps]

278
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:52,750
What the hell is that?

279
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,083
Damn it!

280
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:57,791
If things keep going like
this, we'll have no chance

281
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:00,208
of stopping Bahamut's awakening.

282
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:01,291
Tell me everything you know

283
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:03,375
about who's behind
this, and fast.

284
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:04,958
I'd laugh if it didn't hurt.

285
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:08,333
Whoever heard of a zombie trying
to stop the world from ending?

286
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,166
Don't give a damn
about the world.

287
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,708
I only care about those boys.
They're too young to die.

288
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:15,375
[AZAZEL chuckles] Well I agree
with you on the first part.

289
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:20,708
But the only life I care about
is my own. Make a deal?

290
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:22,666
What kind of deal?

291
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:26,791
Not much. Passage to Abos
is all that I'll need.

292
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:56,166
[MARTINET] The Transcendent Key
is now complete, my lord.

293
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,458
And now we will wake Bahamut.

294
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:01,875
Those devils.
How could they do that?

295
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:04,916
[FAVARO] Guess this means
there's only one option left.

296
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,500
[KAISAR]
What option? You've got a plan?

297
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:10,583
Yeah. Hey!

298
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:12,708
[MARTINET]
Huh?

299
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:16,125
Question for you.
How 'bout we team up?

300
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:52,750
[FAVARO] I'm serious-- please!
I wanna switch sides!

301
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:54,625
Favaro! You rat!

302
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:56,500
You're willing to
abandon your friends?

303
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,500
Just to save your
own miserable neck?

304
00:22:58,583 --> 00:22:59,750
Hell yeah!

305
00:22:59,833 --> 00:23:01,625
They were never really
friends to begin with!

306
00:23:01,708 --> 00:23:03,750
I know when I'm on
a sinking ship!

307
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:05,666
He amuses me.

308
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,583
[FAVARO grunts]

309
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:17,166
[MARTINET]
Drink this, if you're ready.

310
00:23:19,083 --> 00:23:20,916
Ah, heh.

311
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:26,916
Catching others off guard
to gain the advantage.

312
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,708
I'm obviously far more familiar

313
00:23:28,791 --> 00:23:33,083
with your tactics than
you realize, my dear Favaro.

314
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:34,875
[FAVARO groans]

315
00:23:39,958 --> 00:23:49,708
[FAVARO groans, gags]
