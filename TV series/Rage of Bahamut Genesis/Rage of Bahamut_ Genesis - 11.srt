Michael!

8
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,166
Don't lose focus!

9
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,083
But, this means.

10
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:51,250
I know what it means.

11
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:53,458
The moment we feared has come.

12
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:56,458
The Transcendent Key
has been formed.

13
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:07,416
[BACCHUS] Beezlebub? He's a
high-ranking demon, right?

14
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,791
In charge of overseeing Helheim?

15
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,875
He was the one pulling the
girl's strings from the start.

16
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,375
[RITA] But this has been
too big of a puppet show.

17
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:22,083
He must've had some help.

18
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:24,583
[AZAZEL] His lackey,
Martinet, has been helping.

19
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:26,333
Ah? Martinet?

20
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:28,875
What an elegant name,
I bet she's a cute one!

21
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:30,125
[AZAZEL]
She's a he.

[HAMSA groans]

23
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:33,750
You think that could be
another name he uses?

24
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,333
[BACCHUS]
You mean that bounty guy?

25
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:36,958
It's possible, I guess.

26
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:39,250
If anyone can turn
humans into demons,

27
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,291
I'd say he'd have the best shot.

28
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:44,083
[RITA] Or maybe he's not a
demon, he's just posing as one.

29
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:46,625
After all, if a little zombie
girl from nowhere-ville

30
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:50,041
can figure out his spells, how
sophisticated can he really be?

31
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:55,375
We should hurry.

32
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:57,958
I don't think saving existence
is the sort of thing

33
00:04:58,041 --> 00:04:58,916
you should be late for.

No need to despair!

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,708
The key must make contact
with Bahamut for it to work!

37
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:15,708
As long as we maintain
this barrier, we'll prevail!

But why? How could
Jeanne do that?

43
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:56,125
No. That isn't Jeanne.

44
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:58,208
Or rather, it is and it isn't.

45
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,708
Her soul is in there,
but she's changed.

46
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:02,375
She's overflowing
with demonic energy.

But how did this happen?

You can't have stooped that low!

Are you really going to let
those worthless monsters

71
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:56,041
conquer your spirit
with a lousy spell?

72
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:59,833
What about Lady Amira?
What about changing our fate?

But why does she
look like that?

87
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:52,333
She's not a saint now.

88
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:54,500
She's been turned into
a demon through sorcery.

[KAISAR gasps]
Not her, too.

Oh, crap. Hey guys?
We've been spotted.

judgment has come.

are you still alive?

00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:27,208
[KAISAR]
Azazel! What are you doing here?

99
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:28,666
I'd love to stay here and chat

100
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,125
while I methodically
slice you into pieces.

101
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:34,125
Sadly, I have a prior
engagement up there.

102
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:37,208
It's tragic, being too
busy to crush a bug.

103
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:38,375
Fine then.

104
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:40,125
If you can stomach
leaving things this way,

105
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,833
well that's your choice.

106

If you run off now,

108
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,583
that makes your loss
to us permanent.

First, you pitiful
humans never beat me,

And the next time we meet--

If there is a next time.

The world's on the
brink of destruction.

113

We may never cross paths again.

It's all right, Jeanne.

This is our punishment.

my spirit will
always be with you.

164
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,666
You will not be
alone, my Jeanne.

165
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,541
Michael, no!

166
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:36,958
[BACCHUS] At least we don't have
to worry about her anymore.

167
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:39,291
Bacchus, look!
They're closin' in!

168
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:44,208
There's still time.

169
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:45,583
All right.

170
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:47,500
Just have to figure out
where to park the carriage.

171
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:49,458
[RITA] Actually, we're
not parking it at all.

172
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:50,791
--[BACCHUS] What?
--[HAMSA] Say what?

173
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:53,208
We're going to run it
right into those bastards.

174
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:17,125
They still think they
can make a difference.

175
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:20,375
Angels are such
a stubborn breed.

176
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:24,916
But it's time for them to go
and let the new age begin.

177
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,083
Beezlebub!

178
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,750
[AZAZEL]
You gave me some pretty bruises.

179
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:35,333
Now it's my turn!

180
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:38,250
[BEEZLEBUB] So you're in league
with the gods and humans now?

181
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:42,208
You are a fool to the
very core. Azazel.

182
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:59,000
[HAMSA squaking]

183
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,875
Great. You know what?

184
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:10,291
As a demon, you're
even more of a pain.

185
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:14,208
[gasps]

186
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:17,958
[BACCHUS]
You dumbass!

187
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:20,708
[HAMSA squaking]

188
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:23,541
A god riding a god --
I'm honored to be attracting

189
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,375
so much divine attention.

190
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:29,125
[BACCHUS] You and those
damned concoctions.

191
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:07,458
[KAISAR gasps]

192
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:13,291
[KAISAR] We've crossed swords
so many times in our lives.

193
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,625
We've been through
so much together.

194
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:18,916
I know you better than anyone,
and I can tell, Favaro.

195
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,041
By your moves alone.
You really have become a demon.

196
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:32,041
[KAISAR]
I do this for you, old friend.

197
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:14,083
Lady Amira.

198
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,125
[LAVALLEY]
Hello, Kaisar.

199
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:18,875
Lieutenant Lavalley.
What are you doing here?

200
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:21,041
The Orléans Knights
followed Jeanne to Abos,

201
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,375
and boarded this castle when
we saw they held the Key.

202
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,625
In a few more minutes,
we'll seize control of it

203
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,500
and that will be the
end of the threat.

204
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:28,583
So we're safe?

205
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:31,500
That's right.
You've served us well.

206
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:33,750
Take a look at what's happening.

207
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:44,041
[KAISAR] The gods!
They're all descending!

208
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,875
Everything's going to be fine.

209
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:57,541
Come on. Let's get
her back home.

210
00:19:57,625 --> 00:20:00,250
[RITA] Don't trust him!
He's just buying time!

211
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:06,291
--Time for what?
--[rumbling]

212
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:07,958
[yelps]

213
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,500
--[RITA yelps]
--[roaring]

214
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:12,833
--[roaring]

215
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,666
[KAISAR grunts

216
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:41,000
[KAISAR]
Lady Amira!

217
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:44,416
[KAISAR groans]

218
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:51,041
[screams]

219
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,083
Desperation is a powerful force

220
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:55,416
that can make a man very strong.

221
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:53,250
And when I take away what
they're desperate for,

222
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:56,083
it's the greatest
pleasure in the world!

223
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,625
Fava...
