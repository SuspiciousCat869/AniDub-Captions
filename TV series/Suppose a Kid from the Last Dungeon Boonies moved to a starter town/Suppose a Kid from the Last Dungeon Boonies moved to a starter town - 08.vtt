00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.372 position:50% align:center
This lake epitomizes beauty.

00:00:39.456 --> 00:00:41.082 position:50% align:center
Uh, sure does.

00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:42.834 position:50% align:center
Okay, sweetie,
for future reference,

00:00:42.917 --> 00:00:45.462 position:50% align:center
the customary response here is:
"it doesn't compare to you."

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:47.589 position:50% align:center
Aren't we standing
a little close?

00:00:47.672 --> 00:00:49.716 position:50% align:center
It's just an act.

00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:52.260 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:00:52.344 --> 00:00:54.012 position:50% align:center
And like any act,
we expect people to believe,

00:00:54.095 --> 00:00:56.514 position:50% align:center
so we need it to
appear 100% real.

00:00:56.598 --> 00:00:58.141 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD]
Right. Of course.

00:00:58.224 --> 00:01:00.518 position:50% align:center
Oh, um, the lake is
indeed beautiful,

00:01:00.602 --> 00:01:02.145 position:50% align:center
but it doesn't compare to you.

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:06.066 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Why, Lloyd!
Is this a marriage proposal?

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:07.192 position:50% align:center
Let us be wed immediatel--

00:01:07.275 --> 00:01:08.693 position:50% align:center
[SELEN yelps]

00:01:08.777 --> 00:01:10.945 position:50% align:center
Getting a little carried away
by your role there, champ?

00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:14.157 position:50% align:center
We were just getting
to the dÃ©nouement.

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:53.882 position:50% align:center
[COBA]
A proxy?

00:02:53.965 --> 00:02:58.136 position:50% align:center
Why wouldn't Threonine let his
real son be interviewed?

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:01.890 position:50% align:center
By hook or by crook,
I will figure this out!

00:03:01.973 --> 00:03:04.434 position:50% align:center
[RIHO] You do remember the point
of this charade, right?

00:03:04.517 --> 00:03:06.394 position:50% align:center
To ensnare Sir Lloyd
in marriage!

00:03:06.478 --> 00:03:08.396 position:50% align:center
I mean to, uh, investigate.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.273 position:50% align:center
[RIHO] Glad you've got
your priorities straight.

00:03:10.357 --> 00:03:12.734 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA]
Someone looks intense!

00:03:12.817 --> 00:03:14.694 position:50% align:center
I thought you were supposed
to be hotel staff!

00:03:14.778 --> 00:03:17.864 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Shoma!

00:03:17.947 --> 00:03:21.910 position:50% align:center
Look at you! Sportin' those
threads like a noble!

00:03:21.993 --> 00:03:23.286 position:50% align:center
What're you even doing here?

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.790 position:50% align:center
Ah! Someone ordered a bunch
of incendiary devices.

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:28.875 position:50% align:center
Things are gonna
go up in flames!

00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.210 position:50% align:center
[SELEN gasps]

00:03:30.293 --> 00:03:31.753 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA] Whoever it was
bought 'em on rush order.

00:03:31.836 --> 00:03:34.589 position:50% align:center
Super intense, right? Well,
client satisfaction is the name

00:03:34.673 --> 00:03:37.842 position:50% align:center
of the game, so I hauled up
all my best explosives!

00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:39.469 position:50% align:center
Why do I know this was you?

00:03:39.552 --> 00:03:41.304 position:50% align:center
Uh, what are you implying?

00:03:41.388 --> 00:03:45.266 position:50% align:center
Firebombs! How scary!
Hold me, Sir Lloyd!

00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:49.479 position:50% align:center
[RIHO]
What's this guy's story?

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:52.023 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD] Sorry.
This is my old friend Shoma,

00:03:52.107 --> 00:03:53.441 position:50% align:center
from back home in Kunlun.

00:03:53.525 --> 00:03:55.694 position:50% align:center
He's basically like
a big brother to me.

00:03:55.777 --> 00:03:58.988 position:50% align:center
These are my classmates from
the academy, Selen and Riho.

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:01.574 position:50% align:center
[RIHO] They grew up together?
Oh, no wonder.

00:04:01.658 --> 00:04:04.536 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah! I haven't told
you yet. I got accepted!

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:08.540 position:50% align:center
Wow! Heh! Intense!
Proud of ya, squirt! Congrats!

00:04:08.623 --> 00:04:10.542 position:50% align:center
Ha... Thanks!

00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:13.086 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I'd love to hear
why you're dressed like that,

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:14.754 position:50% align:center
'cause I'm sure
it's crazy intense,

00:04:14.838 --> 00:04:16.798 position:50% align:center
but think I gotta roll.
Another time.

00:04:16.881 --> 00:04:18.717 position:50% align:center
Aw, you can't stay
a little while?

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.719 position:50% align:center
Drop these off
for me like a pal?

00:04:20.802 --> 00:04:22.804 position:50% align:center
[RIHO]
Excuse me?

00:04:23.972 --> 00:04:26.266 position:50% align:center
[RIHO]
So, what do we do with these?

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:28.018 position:50% align:center
You're going to
transport them gently,

00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:29.602 position:50% align:center
because they're
extraordinarily volatile

00:04:29.686 --> 00:04:31.187 position:50% align:center
and prone to ignite
without warning.

00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:33.523 position:50% align:center
We'll continue our date!

00:04:33.606 --> 00:04:36.901 position:50% align:center
[gasps] You're supposed
to be investigating!

00:04:36.985 --> 00:04:38.361 position:50% align:center
[SELEN]
Try my ice cream!

00:04:38.445 --> 00:04:42.073 position:50% align:center
Take off your shoes!
Rest your head.

00:04:47.537 --> 00:04:49.914 position:50% align:center
My face was covered
up for so long,

00:04:49.998 --> 00:04:53.126 position:50% align:center
I'd given up any hope of ever
going on a date.

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:54.711 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD]
Huh?

00:04:54.794 --> 00:04:57.464 position:50% align:center
[SELEN] My father used to
collect cursed antiques.

00:04:57.547 --> 00:04:59.090 position:50% align:center
This belt was one of them.

00:04:59.174 --> 00:05:01.885 position:50% align:center
After it bound itself to me,
I was an outcast.

00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:05.472 position:50% align:center
Everywhere I went,
people would point and laugh.

00:05:05.555 --> 00:05:07.599 position:50% align:center
Eventually, I became a shut-in.

00:05:07.682 --> 00:05:11.269 position:50% align:center
All I did was train, hoping
I could beat the curse.

00:05:11.353 --> 00:05:15.523 position:50% align:center
My father did everything
in his power to help, but--

00:05:15.607 --> 00:05:17.984 position:50% align:center
The second it comes off, he
tries to pair me up with Alan,

00:05:18.068 --> 00:05:19.152 position:50% align:center
like I have nothing
better to do

00:05:19.235 --> 00:05:21.613 position:50% align:center
than be some greasy
pig's trophy wife!

00:05:21.696 --> 00:05:24.115 position:50% align:center
Still, we came together
because of it.

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:27.285 position:50% align:center
I'm grateful for the role
it played in our destiny.

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:32.165 position:50% align:center
All in all, I'd say the
tradeoff worked in my favor.

00:05:32.248 --> 00:05:35.669 position:50% align:center
As long as I'm with you, somehow
I feel certain that everything

00:05:35.752 --> 00:05:39.214 position:50% align:center
will all work out,
and I know for a fact

00:05:39.297 --> 00:05:42.050 position:50% align:center
Riho and others
feel the same way.

00:05:42.133 --> 00:05:44.803 position:50% align:center
Did I say something wrong?

00:05:44.886 --> 00:05:47.806 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD]
I'm nobody, Selen.

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:51.976 position:50% align:center
Worse than that, I'm a burden.
I can't do anything on my own.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.480 position:50% align:center
Miss Marie and the chief
have to help me all the time.

00:05:55.563 --> 00:05:57.816 position:50% align:center
I'm just-- I'm just a stupid kid

00:05:57.899 --> 00:06:00.860 position:50% align:center
who thinks he'll be
a soldier someday.

00:06:00.944 --> 00:06:04.030 position:50% align:center
Oh, Sir Lloyd...

00:06:04.114 --> 00:06:05.407 position:50% align:center
[SELEN] You poor thing.

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.702 position:50% align:center
You honestly have no idea
what you mean to us.

00:06:08.785 --> 00:06:10.286 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.372 position:50% align:center
Why do you think
we want to help?

00:06:12.455 --> 00:06:15.291 position:50% align:center
We're trying to pay back
the good you've done.

00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:19.379 position:50% align:center
Think about it. You inspire us
to be better people.

00:06:19.462 --> 00:06:22.298 position:50% align:center
Really? But I--

00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:24.009 position:50% align:center
Really!

00:06:24.092 --> 00:06:27.345 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD]
Huh... Well, that's--

00:06:27.429 --> 00:06:29.055 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:31.474 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD]
Listen. Do me a favor, huh?

00:06:31.558 --> 00:06:33.143 position:50% align:center
Don't tell anyone
we had this talk.

00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:35.061 position:50% align:center
[SELEN yelps]
We share a secret now?

00:06:35.145 --> 00:06:36.730 position:50% align:center
Marriage is
practically inevitable!

00:06:36.813 --> 00:06:39.441 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD] Careful, Miss Selen!
We're gonna capsize!

00:06:39.524 --> 00:06:40.859 position:50% align:center
Look, I can't abandon the guy,

00:06:40.942 --> 00:06:43.570 position:50% align:center
he's clearly just a victim
of circumstance.

00:06:43.653 --> 00:06:47.073 position:50% align:center
Question is, what do
I do with the parasite?

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.871 position:50% align:center
[KIKYOU] I have to find a way
to catch him off guard.

00:06:55.999 --> 00:06:57.792 position:50% align:center
Bingo!

00:06:58.793 --> 00:07:00.670 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:07:03.548 --> 00:07:05.216 position:50% align:center
I thought it was you
I was hearing.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.010 position:50% align:center
[KIKYOU]
But I was in stealth mode!

00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:09.262 position:50% align:center
So what brings you
out here, Miss Kikyou?

00:07:09.346 --> 00:07:12.390 position:50% align:center
Oh. I, uh-- It's my job
to reward you for all the

00:07:12.474 --> 00:07:16.227 position:50% align:center
hard work. With a relaxing
deep-tissue full-body massage!

00:07:16.311 --> 00:07:17.812 position:50% align:center
I've never had one before!

00:07:17.896 --> 00:07:19.773 position:50% align:center
Well, combined
with that footbath,

00:07:19.856 --> 00:07:21.399 position:50% align:center
it'll make you feel awesome!

00:07:21.483 --> 00:07:22.650 position:50% align:center
Perfect timing, actually!

00:07:22.734 --> 00:07:24.861 position:50% align:center
I was hoping to learn
more about massage.

00:07:24.944 --> 00:07:26.237 position:50% align:center
You... you were?

00:07:26.321 --> 00:07:28.490 position:50% align:center
Teach me everything,
Miss! Pretty please?

00:07:28.573 --> 00:07:30.992 position:50% align:center
Yeah sure!
Your boss knows best!

00:07:31.076 --> 00:07:32.452 position:50% align:center
Awesome! Where do I start?

00:07:32.535 --> 00:07:34.204 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:07:37.707 --> 00:07:41.878 position:50% align:center
[KIKYOU] Okay, parasite,
where are you hiding?

00:07:41.961 --> 00:07:43.838 position:50% align:center
Come on, work with me!

00:07:43.922 --> 00:07:46.591 position:50% align:center
Uh, is it supposed to tickle?

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:52.097 position:50% align:center
[KIKYOU]
Oh, god. Oh, god.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.933 position:50% align:center
That's a little on
the nose for a treant.

00:07:58.728 --> 00:08:00.355 position:50% align:center
[gulps]

00:08:04.651 --> 00:08:06.111 position:50% align:center
[KIKYOU gasps]

00:08:07.779 --> 00:08:09.614 position:50% align:center
[SELEN]
Do my eyes deceive me,

00:08:09.698 --> 00:08:12.951 position:50% align:center
or were you just
trying to cop a feel?

00:08:13.034 --> 00:08:15.495 position:50% align:center
Oh, great. She's a psychopath.

00:08:15.578 --> 00:08:17.080 position:50% align:center
Bye now.

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:20.583 position:50% align:center
Dammit! I was so close
to extraction!

00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:23.670 position:50% align:center
Using a diversionary
tactic, are we?

00:08:23.753 --> 00:08:26.297 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Where did she go?

00:08:26.381 --> 00:08:29.009 position:50% align:center
[KIKYOU grunts, yells]

00:08:30.552 --> 00:08:31.970 position:50% align:center
Had enough yet?

00:08:32.053 --> 00:08:38.101 position:50% align:center
Heh! No attack you can levy
at me is true love's equal.

00:08:38.184 --> 00:08:41.062 position:50% align:center
Seriously? What are you,
some kind of monster?

00:08:41.146 --> 00:08:42.147 position:50% align:center
Perhaps.

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:45.358 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD]
Wow, massages are aggressive.

00:08:45.442 --> 00:08:48.778 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Sir Lloyd, please!
Cover up! Er, take cover!

00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:50.447 position:50% align:center
[KIKYOU]
Kikyou, out!

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:51.823 position:50% align:center
[SELEN screams]

00:08:51.906 --> 00:08:53.533 position:50% align:center
That's weird. Did something
come up all of a sudden?

00:08:53.616 --> 00:08:55.618 position:50% align:center
Why on earth are
you half naked?

00:08:55.702 --> 00:08:57.412 position:50% align:center
My supervisor was
just showing me

00:08:57.495 --> 00:08:59.539 position:50% align:center
how to give our clients
a proper massage.

00:08:59.622 --> 00:09:02.542 position:50% align:center
[SELEN] Seems to require
a lot of lubrication.

00:09:02.625 --> 00:09:04.169 position:50% align:center
[SELEN gasps]
Idea!

00:09:04.252 --> 00:09:06.921 position:50% align:center
Why don't we avail ourselves
of the resort's hot springs?

00:09:07.005 --> 00:09:10.383 position:50% align:center
I understand the outdoor bath
has a splendid view!

00:09:10.467 --> 00:09:11.718 position:50% align:center
[SELEN]
And it's unisex.

00:09:11.801 --> 00:09:14.262 position:50% align:center
That sounds great!
I wouldn't want to mess up my

00:09:14.346 --> 00:09:16.639 position:50% align:center
costume rental with
all this body oil.

00:09:16.723 --> 00:09:18.183 position:50% align:center
[SELEN]
Score!

00:09:19.517 --> 00:09:21.227 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD sighs]

00:09:21.311 --> 00:09:24.022 position:50% align:center
[SELEN] Hey! You're supposed
to be investigating!

00:09:24.105 --> 00:09:26.107 position:50% align:center
[RIHO]
Um, yeah. So are you.

00:09:26.191 --> 00:09:27.859 position:50% align:center
I'll have you know
we are keeping watch,

00:09:27.942 --> 00:09:30.362 position:50% align:center
a strategy best conducted
by two people!

00:09:30.445 --> 00:09:31.988 position:50% align:center
Um, could we, like, not?

00:09:32.072 --> 00:09:35.492 position:50% align:center
[ALKA] Make way! My darling

you can't get up again?

00:09:39.871 --> 00:09:41.956 position:50% align:center
When did the two
of you get here?

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:45.335 position:50% align:center
Come on, guys! We talked
about this, remember?

00:09:45.418 --> 00:09:47.837 position:50% align:center
I know, sweetie, but the
water's good for my joints!

00:09:47.921 --> 00:09:49.673 position:50% align:center
By which she means
osteoporosis,

00:09:49.756 --> 00:09:52.550 position:50% align:center
rheumatoid arthritis,
and occasional gout.

00:09:52.634 --> 00:09:53.468 position:50% align:center
[PHYLLO]
Move it.

00:09:53.551 --> 00:09:54.678 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:09:55.679 --> 00:09:57.597 position:50% align:center
Note to self. Steak,
while delicious,

00:09:57.681 --> 00:10:00.308 position:50% align:center
is prone to put you
in a food coma.

00:10:00.392 --> 00:10:02.811 position:50% align:center
You have a lot of gall
showing your faces here.

00:10:02.894 --> 00:10:06.147 position:50% align:center
That ass-whoopin' at
the match not enough?

Oh, dear me, no one's
told you yet.

00:10:08.942 --> 00:10:11.486 position:50% align:center
See, we're here as agents
of the kingdom, in a way,

00:10:11.569 --> 00:10:13.947 position:50% align:center
which incidentally
means that Phyllo

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:15.615 position:50% align:center
will be joining your class!

00:10:15.699 --> 00:10:17.200 position:50% align:center
Hello again.

00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:20.662 position:50% align:center
I intend to be Lloyd's protÃ©gÃ©.
Also, at some point his wife.

[MENA] We've been hired
to look into things.

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:27.919 position:50% align:center
Evidently, the royal
family's very concerned

00:10:28.003 --> 00:10:29.337 position:50% align:center
about what's been
going on here.

00:10:29.421 --> 00:10:31.589 position:50% align:center
The situation's
that big of a deal?

00:10:31.673 --> 00:10:34.134 position:50% align:center
What can I say?
Enough people fall into comas,

00:10:34.217 --> 00:10:37.929 position:50% align:center
and before long, even
the government starts to care.

00:10:38.013 --> 00:10:39.723 position:50% align:center
[SELEN] Keep those paws
to yourself, trollop!

00:10:39.806 --> 00:10:41.933 position:50% align:center
[MENA] Actually, the comas
are only part of it.

00:10:42.017 --> 00:10:44.644 position:50% align:center
There's something even more
sinister going on.

00:10:44.728 --> 00:10:46.021 position:50% align:center
Like what, exactly?

00:10:46.104 --> 00:10:48.732 position:50% align:center
Well, like illegal
treant cultivation.

00:10:48.815 --> 00:10:50.817 position:50% align:center
That, and a troublesome
seedling was stolen.

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:54.112 position:50% align:center
A particularly nasty
customer, I'm told.

00:10:54.195 --> 00:10:57.073 position:50% align:center
[ALKA] Hmm. Based on what I'm
hearing, the coma victims

00:10:57.157 --> 00:11:00.910 position:50% align:center
do seem somewhat consistent
with your standard treant MO.

00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:04.039 position:50% align:center
Nip it in the bud, or this
place'll be overrun soon.

00:11:04.122 --> 00:11:06.332 position:50% align:center
Wait a sec. You're talking
about those creatures

00:11:06.416 --> 00:11:08.293 position:50% align:center
that grow wild outside
the village?

00:11:08.376 --> 00:11:09.502 position:50% align:center
[ALKA]
Yep.

00:11:09.586 --> 00:11:11.755 position:50% align:center
Sorry, quick question.
Who're you exactly?

00:11:11.838 --> 00:11:15.008 position:50% align:center
They call me Alka,
Kunlun village's chief.

00:11:15.091 --> 00:11:16.384 position:50% align:center
Is she for real?

00:11:16.468 --> 00:11:18.970 position:50% align:center
Trust me. Don't overthink it.

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:25.268 position:50% align:center
Understood! Brain

00:11:25.352 --> 00:11:26.978 position:50% align:center
If treants are
really behind this,

00:11:27.062 --> 00:11:28.813 position:50% align:center
I mean, Alan fell
unconscious inside,

00:11:28.897 --> 00:11:29.856 position:50% align:center
you're telling me these things

are using the hotel
as a nursery?

00:11:31.608 --> 00:11:35.236 position:50% align:center
The sapling in question has
likely already infested a human.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:39.115 position:50% align:center
Worst case scenario, this entire
map would need updating.

00:11:39.199 --> 00:11:40.950 position:50% align:center
Oh, no! That does it!

00:11:41.034 --> 00:11:45.622 position:50% align:center
We have to stop the treants
before it's too late!

Oh, don't scold the woman.

00:11:59.386 --> 00:12:01.971 position:50% align:center
It's not polite to ogle
someone's nether region.

Yeah. Besides,
take my word for it,

00:12:04.057 --> 00:12:05.684 position:50% align:center
she's had that coming
for quite a while.

no point in playing dumb,

the word "infested."

If this boot-licking sycophant's

There's got to be
some way for us

00:16:37.163 --> 00:16:38.581 position:50% align:center

follow his example!

[SHOMA] I took the
liberty of burying you

so you wouldn't catch a cold.

understand what it means

to strike a deal with his kind!

Au contraire. Sure I can.

should be apologizing

for having doubted your motives.

Though, your continued patronage
would be appreciated.

Happy to oblige, my good man,

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:29.706 position:50% align:center
and feel free to keep
Kikyou in your employ.

What?!

00:21:32.625 --> 00:21:35.920 position:50% align:center
[ROBIN] Forgive me for
trying to marry you off.

Oh, that lovely face.
It's been so long.

00:21:42.969 --> 00:21:44.846 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Father.

00:21:44.929 --> 00:21:47.682 position:50% align:center
It was wrong of me to
treat you like a pawn.

00:21:47.766 --> 00:21:52.020 position:50% align:center
You are my daughter.
My pride and joy.

00:21:53.938 --> 00:21:56.649 position:50% align:center
Do your best. Right?

00:21:56.733 --> 00:21:59.152 position:50% align:center
Of course. Always!

married already!

this is not okay!

Gracious. Ugh, I'm so
terribly exhausted.

I don't know about anyone else,

but after all that repair magic,
I could use a massage.

Oh! Hey, Chief!

00:22:18.088 --> 00:22:20.131 position:50% align:center
Actually, I could give you
a massage if you want!

00:22:20.215 --> 00:22:22.717 position:50% align:center
Precisely what I hoped
you'd say, darling!

I just learned the
technique yesterday!

00:22:24.803 --> 00:22:29.057 position:50% align:center
Oh-ho! I'm sure it's marvelous!

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:31.393 position:50% align:center

where this is going!
