00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.372 position:50% align:center
This lake epitomizes beauty.

00:00:39.456 --> 00:00:41.082 position:50% align:center
Uh, sure does.

00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:42.834 position:50% align:center
Okay, sweetie,
for future reference,

00:00:42.917 --> 00:00:45.462 position:50% align:center
the customary response here is:
"it doesn't compare to you."

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:47.589 position:50% align:center
Aren't we standing
a little close?

00:00:47.672 --> 00:00:49.716 position:50% align:center
It's just an act.

00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:52.260 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:00:52.344 --> 00:00:54.012 position:50% align:center
And like any act,
we expect people to believe,

00:00:54.095 --> 00:00:56.514 position:50% align:center
so we need it to
appear 100% real.

00:00:56.598 --> 00:00:58.141 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD]
Right. Of course.

00:00:58.224 --> 00:01:00.518 position:50% align:center
Oh, um, the lake is
indeed beautiful,

00:01:00.602 --> 00:01:02.145 position:50% align:center
but it doesn't compare to you.

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:06.066 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Why, Lloyd!
Is this a marriage proposal?

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:07.192 position:50% align:center
Let us be wed immediatel--

00:01:07.275 --> 00:01:08.693 position:50% align:center
[SELEN yelps]

00:01:08.777 --> 00:01:10.945 position:50% align:center
Getting a little carried away
by your role there, champ?

00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:14.157 position:50% align:center
We were just getting
to the dénouement.

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:53.882 position:50% align:center
[COBA]
A proxy?

00:02:53.965 --> 00:02:58.136 position:50% align:center
Why wouldn't Threonine let his
real son be interviewed?

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:01.890 position:50% align:center
By hook or by crook,
I will figure this out!

00:03:01.973 --> 00:03:04.434 position:50% align:center
[RIHO] You do remember the point
of this charade, right?

00:03:04.517 --> 00:03:06.394 position:50% align:center
To ensnare Sir Lloyd
in marriage!

00:03:06.478 --> 00:03:08.396 position:50% align:center
I mean to, uh, investigate.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.273 position:50% align:center
[RIHO] Glad you've got
your priorities straight.

00:03:10.357 --> 00:03:12.734 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA]
Someone looks intense!

00:03:12.817 --> 00:03:14.694 position:50% align:center
I thought you were supposed
to be hotel staff!

00:03:14.778 --> 00:03:17.864 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Shoma!

00:03:17.947 --> 00:03:21.910 position:50% align:center
Look at you! Sportin' those
threads like a noble!

00:03:21.993 --> 00:03:23.286 position:50% align:center
What're you even doing here?

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.790 position:50% align:center
Ah! Someone ordered a bunch
of incendiary devices.

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:28.875 position:50% align:center
Things are gonna
go up in flames!

00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.210 position:50% align:center
[SELEN gasps]

00:03:30.293 --> 00:03:31.753 position:50% align:center
[SHOMA] Whoever it was
bought 'em on rush order.

00:03:31.836 --> 00:03:34.589 position:50% align:center
Super intense, right? Well,
client satisfaction is the name

00:03:34.673 --> 00:03:37.842 position:50% align:center
of the game, so I hauled up
all my best explosives!

00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:39.469 position:50% align:center
Why do I know this was you?

00:03:39.552 --> 00:03:41.304 position:50% align:center
Uh, what are you implying?

00:03:41.388 --> 00:03:45.266 position:50% align:center
Firebombs! How scary!
Hold me, Sir Lloyd!

00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:49.479 position:50% align:center
[RIHO]
What's this guy's story?

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:52.023 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD] Sorry.
This is my old friend Shoma,

00:03:52.107 --> 00:03:53.441 position:50% align:center
from back home in Kunlun.

00:03:53.525 --> 00:03:55.694 position:50% align:center
He's basically like
a big brother to me.

00:03:55.777 --> 00:03:58.988 position:50% align:center
These are my classmates from
the academy, Selen and Riho.

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:01.574 position:50% align:center
[RIHO] They grew up together?
Oh, no wonder.

00:04:01.658 --> 00:04:04.536 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah! I haven't told
you yet. I got accepted!

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:08.540 position:50% align:center
Wow! Heh! Intense!
Proud of ya, squirt! Congrats!

00:04:08.623 --> 00:04:10.542 position:50% align:center
Ha... Thanks!

00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:13.086 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I'd love to hear
why you're dressed like that,

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:14.754 position:50% align:center
'cause I'm sure
it's crazy intense,

00:04:14.838 --> 00:04:16.798 position:50% align:center
but think I gotta roll.
Another time.

00:04:16.881 --> 00:04:18.717 position:50% align:center
Aw, you can't stay
a little while?

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.719 position:50% align:center
Drop these off
for me like a pal?

00:04:20.802 --> 00:04:22.804 position:50% align:center
[RIHO]
Excuse me?

00:04:23.972 --> 00:04:26.266 position:50% align:center
[RIHO]
So, what do we do with these?

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:28.018 position:50% align:center
You're going to
transport them gently,

00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:29.602 position:50% align:center
because they're
extraordinarily volatile

00:04:29.686 --> 00:04:31.187 position:50% align:center
and prone to ignite
without warning.

00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:33.523 position:50% align:center
We'll continue our date!

00:04:33.606 --> 00:04:36.901 position:50% align:center
[gasps] You're supposed
to be investigating!

00:04:36.985 --> 00:04:38.361 position:50% align:center
[SELEN]
Try my ice cream!

00:04:38.445 --> 00:04:42.073 position:50% align:center
Take off your shoes!
Rest your head.

00:04:47.537 --> 00:04:49.914 position:50% align:center
My face was covered
up for so long,

00:04:49.998 --> 00:04:53.126 position:50% align:center
I'd given up any hope of ever
going on a date.

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:54.711 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD]
Huh?

00:04:54.794 --> 00:04:57.464 position:50% align:center
[SELEN] My father used to
collect cursed antiques.

00:04:57.547 --> 00:04:59.090 position:50% align:center
This belt was one of them.

00:04:59.174 --> 00:05:01.885 position:50% align:center
After it bound itself to me,
I was an outcast.

00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:05.472 position:50% align:center
Everywhere I went,
people would point and laugh.

00:05:05.555 --> 00:05:07.599 position:50% align:center
Eventually, I became a shut-in.

00:05:07.682 --> 00:05:11.269 position:50% align:center
All I did was train, hoping
I could beat the curse.

00:05:11.353 --> 00:05:15.523 position:50% align:center
My father did everything
in his power to help, but--

00:05:15.607 --> 00:05:17.984 position:50% align:center
The second it comes off, he
tries to pair me up with Alan,

00:05:18.068 --> 00:05:19.152 position:50% align:center
like I have nothing
better to do

00:05:19.235 --> 00:05:21.613 position:50% align:center
than be some greasy
pig's trophy wife!

00:05:21.696 --> 00:05:24.115 position:50% align:center
Still, we came together
because of it.

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:27.285 position:50% align:center
I'm grateful for the role
it played in our destiny.

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:32.165 position:50% align:center
All in all, I'd say the
tradeoff worked in my favor.

00:05:32.248 --> 00:05:35.669 position:50% align:center
As long as I'm with you, somehow
I feel certain that everything

00:05:35.752 --> 00:05:39.214 position:50% align:center
will all work out,
and I know for a fact

00:05:39.297 --> 00:05:42.050 position:50% align:center
Riho and others
feel the same way.

00:05:42.133 --> 00:05:44.803 position:50% align:center
Did I say something wrong?

00:05:44.886 --> 00:05:47.806 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD]
I'm nobody, Selen.

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:51.976 position:50% align:center
Worse than that, I'm a burden.
I can't do anything on my own.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.480 position:50% align:center
Miss Marie and the chief
have to help me all the time.

00:05:55.563 --> 00:05:57.816 position:50% align:center
I'm just-- I'm just a stupid kid

00:05:57.899 --> 00:06:00.860 position:50% align:center
who thinks he'll be
a soldier someday.

00:06:00.944 --> 00:06:04.030 position:50% align:center
Oh, Sir Lloyd...

00:06:04.114 --> 00:06:05.407 position:50% align:center
[SELEN] You poor thing.

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.702 position:50% align:center
You honestly have no idea
what you mean to us.

00:06:08.785 --> 00:06:10.286 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.372 position:50% align:center
Why do you think
we want to help?

00:06:12.455 --> 00:06:15.291 position:50% align:center
We're trying to pay back
the good you've done.

00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:19.379 position:50% align:center
Think about it. You inspire us
to be better people.

00:06:19.462 --> 00:06:22.298 position:50% align:center
Really? But I--

00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:24.009 position:50% align:center
Really!

00:06:24.092 --> 00:06:27.345 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD]
Huh... Well, that's--

00:06:27.429 --> 00:06:29.055 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:31.474 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD]
Listen. Do me a favor, huh?

00:06:31.558 --> 00:06:33.143 position:50% align:center
Don't tell anyone
we had this talk.

00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:35.061 position:50% align:center
[SELEN yelps]
We share a secret now?

00:06:35.145 --> 00:06:36.730 position:50% align:center
Marriage is
practically inevitable!

00:06:36.813 --> 00:06:39.441 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD] Careful, Miss Selen!
We're gonna capsize!

00:06:39.524 --> 00:06:40.859 position:50% align:center
Look, I can't abandon the guy,

00:06:40.942 --> 00:06:43.570 position:50% align:center
he's clearly just a victim
of circumstance.

00:06:43.653 --> 00:06:47.073 position:50% align:center
Question is, what do
I do with the parasite?

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.871 position:50% align:center
[KIKYOU] I have to find a way
to catch him off guard.

00:06:55.999 --> 00:06:57.792 position:50% align:center
Bingo!

00:06:58.793 --> 00:07:00.670 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:07:03.548 --> 00:07:05.216 position:50% align:center
I thought it was you
I was hearing.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.010 position:50% align:center
[KIKYOU]
But I was in stealth mode!

00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:09.262 position:50% align:center
So what brings you
out here, Miss Kikyou?

00:07:09.346 --> 00:07:12.390 position:50% align:center
Oh. I, uh-- It's my job
to reward you for all the

00:07:12.474 --> 00:07:16.227 position:50% align:center
hard work. With a relaxing
deep-tissue full-body massage!

00:07:16.311 --> 00:07:17.812 position:50% align:center
I've never had one before!

00:07:17.896 --> 00:07:19.773 position:50% align:center
Well, combined
with that footbath,

00:07:19.856 --> 00:07:21.399 position:50% align:center
it'll make you feel awesome!

00:07:21.483 --> 00:07:22.650 position:50% align:center
Perfect timing, actually!

00:07:22.734 --> 00:07:24.861 position:50% align:center
I was hoping to learn
more about massage.

00:07:24.944 --> 00:07:26.237 position:50% align:center
You... you were?

00:07:26.321 --> 00:07:28.490 position:50% align:center
Teach me everything,
Miss! Pretty please?

00:07:28.573 --> 00:07:30.992 position:50% align:center
Yeah sure!
Your boss knows best!

00:07:31.076 --> 00:07:32.452 position:50% align:center
Awesome! Where do I start?

00:07:32.535 --> 00:07:34.204 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:07:37.707 --> 00:07:41.878 position:50% align:center
[KIKYOU] Okay, parasite,
where are you hiding?

00:07:41.961 --> 00:07:43.838 position:50% align:center
Come on, work with me!

00:07:43.922 --> 00:07:46.591 position:50% align:center
Uh, is it supposed to tickle?

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:52.097 position:50% align:center
[KIKYOU]
Oh, god. Oh, god.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.933 position:50% align:center
That's a little on
the nose for a treant.

00:07:58.728 --> 00:08:00.355 position:50% align:center
[gulps]

00:08:04.651 --> 00:08:06.111 position:50% align:center
[KIKYOU gasps]

00:08:07.779 --> 00:08:09.614 position:50% align:center
[SELEN]
Do my eyes deceive me,

00:08:09.698 --> 00:08:12.951 position:50% align:center
or were you just
trying to cop a feel?

00:08:13.034 --> 00:08:15.495 position:50% align:center
Oh, great. She's a psychopath.

00:08:15.578 --> 00:08:17.080 position:50% align:center
Bye now.

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:20.583 position:50% align:center
Dammit! I was so close
to extraction!

00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:23.670 position:50% align:center
Using a diversionary
tactic, are we?

00:08:23.753 --> 00:08:26.297 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Where did she go?

00:08:26.381 --> 00:08:29.009 position:50% align:center
[KIKYOU grunts, yells]

00:08:30.552 --> 00:08:31.970 position:50% align:center
Had enough yet?

00:08:32.053 --> 00:08:38.101 position:50% align:center
Heh! No attack you can levy
at me is true love's equal.

00:08:38.184 --> 00:08:41.062 position:50% align:center
Seriously? What are you,
some kind of monster?

00:08:41.146 --> 00:08:42.147 position:50% align:center
Perhaps.

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:45.358 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD]
Wow, massages are aggressive.

00:08:45.442 --> 00:08:48.778 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Sir Lloyd, please!
Cover up! Er, take cover!

00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:50.447 position:50% align:center
[KIKYOU]
Kikyou, out!

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:51.823 position:50% align:center
[SELEN screams]

00:08:51.906 --> 00:08:53.533 position:50% align:center
That's weird. Did something
come up all of a sudden?

00:08:53.616 --> 00:08:55.618 position:50% align:center
Why on earth are
you half naked?

00:08:55.702 --> 00:08:57.412 position:50% align:center
My supervisor was
just showing me

00:08:57.495 --> 00:08:59.539 position:50% align:center
how to give our clients
a proper massage.

00:08:59.622 --> 00:09:02.542 position:50% align:center
[SELEN] Seems to require
a lot of lubrication.

00:09:02.625 --> 00:09:04.169 position:50% align:center
[SELEN gasps]
Idea!

00:09:04.252 --> 00:09:06.921 position:50% align:center
Why don't we avail ourselves
of the resort's hot springs?

00:09:07.005 --> 00:09:10.383 position:50% align:center
I understand the outdoor bath
has a splendid view!

00:09:10.467 --> 00:09:11.718 position:50% align:center
[SELEN]
And it's unisex.

00:09:11.801 --> 00:09:14.262 position:50% align:center
That sounds great!
I wouldn't want to mess up my

00:09:14.346 --> 00:09:16.639 position:50% align:center
costume rental with
all this body oil.

00:09:16.723 --> 00:09:18.183 position:50% align:center
[SELEN]
Score!

00:09:19.517 --> 00:09:21.227 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD sighs]

00:09:21.311 --> 00:09:24.022 position:50% align:center
[SELEN] Hey! You're supposed
to be investigating!

00:09:24.105 --> 00:09:26.107 position:50% align:center
[RIHO]
Um, yeah. So are you.

00:09:26.191 --> 00:09:27.859 position:50% align:center
I'll have you know
we are keeping watch,

00:09:27.942 --> 00:09:30.362 position:50% align:center
a strategy best conducted
by two people!

00:09:30.445 --> 00:09:31.988 position:50% align:center
Um, could we, like, not?

00:09:32.072 --> 00:09:35.492 position:50% align:center
[ALKA] Make way! My darling
needs me to scrub his back!

Have you fallen and
you can't get up again?

00:09:39.871 --> 00:09:41.956 position:50% align:center
When did the two
of you get here?

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:45.335 position:50% align:center
Come on, guys! We talked
about this, remember?

00:09:45.418 --> 00:09:47.837 position:50% align:center
I know, sweetie, but the
water's good for my joints!

00:09:47.921 --> 00:09:49.673 position:50% align:center
By which she means
osteoporosis,

00:09:49.756 --> 00:09:52.550 position:50% align:center
rheumatoid arthritis,
and occasional gout.

00:09:52.634 --> 00:09:53.468 position:50% align:center
[PHYLLO]
Move it.

00:09:53.551 --> 00:09:54.678 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:09:55.679 --> 00:09:57.597 position:50% align:center
Note to self. Steak,
while delicious,

00:09:57.681 --> 00:10:00.308 position:50% align:center
is prone to put you
in a food coma.

00:10:00.392 --> 00:10:02.811 position:50% align:center
You have a lot of gall
showing your faces here.

00:10:02.894 --> 00:10:06.147 position:50% align:center
That ass-whoopin' at
the match not enough?

00:10:06.231 --> 00:10:08.858 position:50% align:center
Oh, dear me, no one's
told you yet.

00:10:08.942 --> 00:10:11.486 position:50% align:center
See, we're here as agents
of the kingdom, in a way,

00:10:11.569 --> 00:10:13.947 position:50% align:center
which incidentally
means that Phyllo

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:15.615 position:50% align:center
will be joining your class!

00:10:15.699 --> 00:10:17.200 position:50% align:center
Hello again.

00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:20.662 position:50% align:center
I intend to be Lloyd's protégé.
Also, at some point his wife.

[SELEN, RIHO growl]

[MENA] We've been hired
to look into things.

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:27.919 position:50% align:center
Evidently, the royal
family's very concerned

00:10:28.003 --> 00:10:29.337 position:50% align:center
about what's been
going on here.

00:10:29.421 --> 00:10:31.589 position:50% align:center
The situation's
that big of a deal?

00:10:31.673 --> 00:10:34.134 position:50% align:center
What can I say?
Enough people fall into comas,

00:10:34.217 --> 00:10:37.929 position:50% align:center
and before long, even
the government starts to care.

00:10:38.013 --> 00:10:39.723 position:50% align:center
[SELEN] Keep those paws
to yourself, trollop!

00:10:39.806 --> 00:10:41.933 position:50% align:center
[MENA] Actually, the comas
are only part of it.

00:10:42.017 --> 00:10:44.644 position:50% align:center
There's something even more
sinister going on.

00:10:44.728 --> 00:10:46.021 position:50% align:center
Like what, exactly?

00:10:46.104 --> 00:10:48.732 position:50% align:center
Well, like illegal
treant cultivation.

00:10:48.815 --> 00:10:50.817 position:50% align:center
That, and a troublesome
seedling was stolen.

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:54.112 position:50% align:center
A particularly nasty
customer, I'm told.

00:10:54.195 --> 00:10:57.073 position:50% align:center
[ALKA] Hmm. Based on what I'm
hearing, the coma victims

00:10:57.157 --> 00:11:00.910 position:50% align:center
do seem somewhat consistent
with your standard treant MO.

00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:04.039 position:50% align:center
Nip it in the bud, or this
place'll be overrun soon.

00:11:04.122 --> 00:11:06.332 position:50% align:center
Wait a sec. You're talking
about those creatures

00:11:06.416 --> 00:11:08.293 position:50% align:center
that grow wild outside
the village?

00:11:08.376 --> 00:11:09.502 position:50% align:center
[ALKA]
Yep.

00:11:09.586 --> 00:11:11.755 position:50% align:center
Sorry, quick question.
Who're you exactly?

00:11:11.838 --> 00:11:15.008 position:50% align:center
They call me Alka,
Kunlun village's chief.

00:11:15.091 --> 00:11:16.384 position:50% align:center
Is she for real?

00:11:16.468 --> 00:11:18.970 position:50% align:center
Trust me. Don't overthink it.

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:25.268 position:50% align:center
Understood! Brain
switched to sleep mode.

00:11:25.352 --> 00:11:26.978 position:50% align:center
If treants are
really behind this,

00:11:27.062 --> 00:11:28.813 position:50% align:center
I mean, Alan fell
unconscious inside,

00:11:28.897 --> 00:11:29.856 position:50% align:center
you're telling me these things

00:11:29.939 --> 00:11:31.524 position:50% align:center
are using the hotel
as a nursery?

00:11:31.608 --> 00:11:35.236 position:50% align:center
The sapling in question has
likely already infested a human.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:39.115 position:50% align:center
Worst case scenario, this entire
map would need updating.

00:11:39.199 --> 00:11:40.950 position:50% align:center
Oh, no! That does it!

00:11:41.034 --> 00:11:45.622 position:50% align:center
We have to stop the treants
before it's too late!

It's not polite to throw

Oh, don't scold the woman.

00:11:59.386 --> 00:12:01.971 position:50% align:center
It's not polite to ogle
someone's nether region.

00:12:02.055 --> 00:12:03.973 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Besides,
take my word for it,

00:12:04.057 --> 00:12:05.684 position:50% align:center
she's had that coming
for quite a while.

00:12:28.915 --> 00:12:32.377 position:50% align:center

no point in playing dumb,

the word "infested."

If this boot-licking sycophant's

been the host all along, then,
what's the deal with Lloyd?

There's got to be
some way for us

should be apologizing

Kikyou in your employ.

Thank you, Father.

00:21:44.929 --> 00:21:47.682 position:50% align:center
It was wrong of me to
treat you like a pawn.

You are my daughter.

I could use a massage.

a massage if you want!

Precisely what I hoped
you'd say, darling!

technique yesterday!
