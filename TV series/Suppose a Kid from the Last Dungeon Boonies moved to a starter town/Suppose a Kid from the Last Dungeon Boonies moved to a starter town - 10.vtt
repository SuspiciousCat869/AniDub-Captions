[KING]
Yes! I rather like this idea

00:00:35.744 --> 00:00:38.538 position:50% align:center
of an exhibition match
between Azami and Jiou!

00:00:38.621 --> 00:00:40.623 position:50% align:center
What a splendidly
unambiguous way

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:41.833 position:50% align:center
to show the world
we're committed

00:00:41.916 --> 00:00:44.919 position:50% align:center
to being good neighbors!

00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:47.172 position:50% align:center
In fact, as a sign
of good faith,

00:00:47.255 --> 00:00:50.467 position:50% align:center
we shall send them
our very best warrior.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.179 position:50% align:center
An absolute unit!
Someone fierce! Legendary!

00:00:54.262 --> 00:00:56.014 position:50% align:center
And that would be who?

00:02:31.776 --> 00:02:33.778 position:50% align:center
I'm excited to see
your hometown!

00:02:33.862 --> 00:02:35.822 position:50% align:center
Ha, ha. Manage
your expectations.

00:02:35.905 --> 00:02:37.282 position:50% align:center
Oh, come on.

00:02:37.365 --> 00:02:38.533 position:50% align:center
Hey, why do we have to take

00:02:38.616 --> 00:02:40.910 position:50% align:center
a weird scenic route
like this, chief?

00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:43.997 position:50% align:center
I had intended to use my magic
and teleport us there

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.290 position:50% align:center
in one fell swoop,

00:02:45.373 --> 00:02:47.792 position:50% align:center
but I'm afraid that's
not an option right now.

00:02:47.876 --> 00:02:49.794 position:50% align:center
We have to rendezvous
with a dwarf.

00:02:49.878 --> 00:02:51.629 position:50% align:center
Should be fun.

00:02:51.713 --> 00:02:53.840 position:50% align:center
Kunlun, Kunlun, Kunlun!

00:02:53.923 --> 00:02:56.468 position:50% align:center
Hoards of treasure as
far as the eye can see!

00:02:56.551 --> 00:02:59.763 position:50% align:center
One marriage license form in
my jacket, one in my shirt,

00:02:59.846 --> 00:03:03.058 position:50% align:center
one behind my back,
and one under my skirt!

00:03:03.141 --> 00:03:04.309 position:50% align:center
I am gonna go toe-to-toe

00:03:04.392 --> 00:03:06.269 position:50% align:center
with something
exceptionally tough!

00:03:06.353 --> 00:03:07.645 position:50% align:center
Marriage, here I come!

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:09.147 position:50% align:center
Treasure, hoard here I come!

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.565 position:50% align:center
Toughness, here I come!

00:03:10.648 --> 00:03:13.526 position:50% align:center
I'll meet Sir Lloyd's family.
Secure their blessing!

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.365 position:50% align:center
Silence! We're going to
Kunlun to restore Vritra!

00:03:18.448 --> 00:03:21.951 position:50% align:center
Not to be a hall monitor, but
should Chrome even be here?

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:23.119 position:50% align:center
I thought the castle had you

00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:25.205 position:50% align:center
drowning in work up
to your sideburns.

00:03:25.288 --> 00:03:27.207 position:50% align:center
Funny you should say that.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.044 position:50% align:center
[ALAN]
Ahh! Sir Lloyd!

00:03:31.127 --> 00:03:32.128 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:34.005 position:50% align:center
Cast Aqua Whip!

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:35.965 position:50% align:center
[ALAN groans, sighs]

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:36.883 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:03:36.966 --> 00:03:39.344 position:50% align:center
Not my first rodeo.

00:03:39.427 --> 00:03:42.347 position:50% align:center
The king wants to see Alan
the Immortal Destroyer.

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.683 position:50% align:center
Consider yourself an
honored guest of the crown

00:03:44.766 --> 00:03:46.309 position:50% align:center
until the exhibition
match is over.

00:03:46.393 --> 00:03:48.937 position:50% align:center
[gasps] He's fighting in
the exhibition match?

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.814 position:50% align:center
That is so unbelievably cool!

00:03:50.897 --> 00:03:52.399 position:50% align:center
[ALAN]
Is it, though?

00:03:52.482 --> 00:03:54.818 position:50% align:center
[MENA] I've been instructed to
keep you on a very tight leash,

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:57.153 position:50% align:center
Mister Crimson
Jewel of Darkness.

00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:59.322 position:50% align:center
[ALAN] How many nicknames
are you giving me?

00:03:59.406 --> 00:04:02.158 position:50% align:center
[MENA] Well, that depends on
how many the king makes up.

00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:05.620 position:50% align:center
Why they gotta be so extra?
Do something, Sir Lloyd!

00:04:05.704 --> 00:04:08.039 position:50% align:center
Don't be the guy that
just stands there!

00:04:08.123 --> 00:04:10.291 position:50% align:center
I'm begging you--

00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:12.919 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD] Don't you worry!
I'll be there to cheer you on!

00:04:13.003 --> 00:04:15.755 position:50% align:center
You've totally got this, Alan!

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:19.634 position:50% align:center
In summation, Mena is more
than capable of covering for me.

00:04:19.718 --> 00:04:21.261 position:50% align:center
[CHOLINE]
Thank you, Mena.

00:04:21.344 --> 00:04:23.513 position:50% align:center
[MARIE]
Best of luck, Alan.

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:28.893 position:50% align:center
[ALKA]
Here we are.

00:04:28.977 --> 00:04:30.770 position:50% align:center
All right, then.

00:04:32.772 --> 00:04:35.150 position:50% align:center
It's me, Eug! Come on out now!

00:04:41.364 --> 00:04:43.450 position:50% align:center
Greetings and salutations, all!

00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:45.452 position:50% align:center
Professor Eug at your service.

00:04:45.535 --> 00:04:47.328 position:50% align:center
For the record
I'm dwarven royalty,

00:04:47.412 --> 00:04:49.164 position:50% align:center
but no need to make
a big deal out of it.

00:04:49.247 --> 00:04:52.709 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Uhh...

00:04:52.792 --> 00:04:54.919 position:50% align:center
Few more people than
we agreed on, Alk.

00:04:55.003 --> 00:04:57.672 position:50% align:center
Shocking, you've already found
something to complain about.

00:04:57.756 --> 00:04:59.424 position:50% align:center
Is this person really a dwarf?

00:04:59.507 --> 00:05:01.760 position:50% align:center
I'm having more trouble
with the royalty thing.

00:05:01.843 --> 00:05:03.511 position:50% align:center
A boring formality.

00:05:03.595 --> 00:05:06.306 position:50% align:center
Even in my hundies, I've got
the best damn skills of anyone

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:07.891 position:50% align:center
in the game, and
that's not a game

00:05:07.974 --> 00:05:09.267 position:50% align:center
you're allowed to quit.

00:05:09.351 --> 00:05:10.602 position:50% align:center
Did you say hundies?

00:05:10.685 --> 00:05:12.437 position:50% align:center
In other words, I'm old.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.273 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Uhh...

00:05:15.357 --> 00:05:18.568 position:50% align:center
Then that must put you around
the same age as the chief.

00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:20.153 position:50% align:center
I'd be very careful
about lumping me

00:05:20.236 --> 00:05:22.322 position:50% align:center
in the same category
as Alka if I were you.

00:05:22.405 --> 00:05:24.949 position:50% align:center
Uh... My bad!
You're nothing alike!

00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:27.452 position:50% align:center
[EUG]
Forgiven. Hey there, Vri.

00:05:27.535 --> 00:05:29.037 position:50% align:center
[VRITRA]
Huh?

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.497 position:50% align:center
What made you think
it'd be a good idea

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.332 position:50% align:center
to go wandering
outside the village?

00:05:32.415 --> 00:05:34.584 position:50% align:center
You've completely derailed
my master plan!

00:05:34.668 --> 00:05:36.378 position:50% align:center
[VRITRA]
It was Alka's fault!

00:05:36.461 --> 00:05:37.712 position:50% align:center
Of course it was Alka's fault!

00:05:37.796 --> 00:05:39.214 position:50% align:center
When is it ever
not Alka's fault?

00:05:39.297 --> 00:05:41.675 position:50% align:center
She's the root of all evil
and the embodiment of idiocy!

00:05:41.758 --> 00:05:43.677 position:50% align:center
How many times have I
told you that as Guardian,

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.512 position:50% align:center
it's your job to
bear that in mind?

00:05:45.595 --> 00:05:47.639 position:50% align:center
[ALKA] Excuse me, in case
it slipped your memory,

00:05:47.722 --> 00:05:49.766 position:50% align:center
making an apron out of
his skin was your idea

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:52.310 position:50% align:center
in the first place! If I'm
the "embodiment of idiocy,"

00:05:52.394 --> 00:05:53.687 position:50% align:center
it's only because
I listened to you

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.690 position:50% align:center
tell me it'd be
a great gift for Lloyd!

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:03.446 position:50% align:center
Whadd'ya say we put this
behind us and move forward?

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.573 position:50% align:center
Specifically to Kunlun!

00:06:05.657 --> 00:06:08.827 position:50% align:center
[GROUP screams]

00:06:09.828 --> 00:06:11.037 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:17.752 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow!

00:06:17.836 --> 00:06:20.714 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD]
Well, there it is!

00:06:22.757 --> 00:06:24.926 position:50% align:center
I've never breathed
air so unsullied.

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:27.679 position:50% align:center
I pictured something way more
terrifying! This is nice!

00:06:27.762 --> 00:06:28.805 position:50% align:center
And quite tranquil.

00:06:28.888 --> 00:06:31.349 position:50% align:center
Huh. Everything
looks so ordinary.

00:06:31.433 --> 00:06:33.184 position:50% align:center
I thought there'd be
houses made of gold,

00:06:33.268 --> 00:06:36.021 position:50% align:center
or roads paved
with divine artifacts.

00:06:36.104 --> 00:06:38.982 position:50% align:center
Don't let your guard down.
Your eyes might pop out.

00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:41.526 position:50% align:center

Yeah, I know.

It feels like death is
around every corner!

Goodness gracious,
where did I leave it now?

00:07:01.838 --> 00:07:04.341 position:50% align:center
Oh, upstairs probably!

00:07:04.424 --> 00:07:05.342 position:50% align:center

Teach me your ways,

Yes. With all respect,
I practice the Pyrid Style.

And her soul just
left her body.

Welp, I guess one person's MMA

Well aren't you considerate.

Not quite long enough for us

Don't be ashamed.

00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:14.883 position:50% align:center
We all have to relieve
ourselves every now

I will have you know
that my passion

only been a pawn,

a traveling merchant.
He gave me an egg.

From that moment, the thought
of consequences seemed remote,

impulses outside of myself.

that time that you asked me

00:21:55.774 --> 00:21:57.442 position:50% align:center
but I just didn't listen.

00:21:57.525 --> 00:22:00.987 position:50% align:center
What can you tell me about this
so-called merchant's appearance?

00:22:01.071 --> 00:22:04.157 position:50% align:center
[MERTHOPHAN]
Well, he was in his thirties.

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:05.909 position:50% align:center
Or was it his sixties?

00:22:05.992 --> 00:22:07.827 position:50% align:center
Wait, how does that work?

00:22:07.911 --> 00:22:09.537 position:50% align:center
[MERTHOPHAN]
My memory of him is fuzzy.

00:22:09.621 --> 00:22:11.748 position:50% align:center
[MARIE] But we can assume
this was the man behind

00:22:11.831 --> 00:22:14.084 position:50% align:center
the Demon Lord who
possessed my father?

00:22:14.167 --> 00:22:16.169 position:50% align:center
[MERTHOPHAN]
Hold on. It's coming back.

00:22:16.252 --> 00:22:19.047 position:50% align:center
I-- "Kindly describe
how I appear."

00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:20.590 position:50% align:center
That's how he phrased it!

00:22:20.674 --> 00:22:22.050 position:50% align:center
[MARIE, CHROME gasp]

00:22:22.133 --> 00:22:25.595 position:50% align:center
[MARIE]
Why does that sound... familiar?

00:23:58.063 --> 00:23:59.230 position:50% align:center
My darling!

00:23:59.314 --> 00:24:01.691 position:50% align:center
Why in the world are you
out and about so late?

00:24:01.775 --> 00:24:06.029 position:50% align:center
Oh. I'm, uh-- Takin' a walk?
