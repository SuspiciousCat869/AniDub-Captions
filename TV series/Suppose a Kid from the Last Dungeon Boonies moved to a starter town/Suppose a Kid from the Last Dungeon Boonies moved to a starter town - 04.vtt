[CROWD screaming]

00:00:44.792 --> 00:00:47.542 align:middle
[LLOYD] Everyone says the city's
been overrun with monsters

00:00:47.625 --> 00:00:50.917 align:middle
lately, but all I'm seeing
are these bugs.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.542 align:middle
[ALKA]
Right...

00:00:52.625 --> 00:00:57.917 align:middle
They've got to be around here
somewhere. Hmm, wait a minute.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.667 align:middle
So annoying.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.625 align:middle
These stupid locusts ruined
a perfectly good night out.

00:01:03.708 --> 00:01:06.917 align:middle
Hmm... Are they from...?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.167 align:middle
[LLOYD] Chief. Sorry,
I hate to ditch like this,

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.125 align:middle
but I have to find Miss Marie.
She might be in trouble.

00:01:16.208 --> 00:01:18.542 align:middle
Darling, I'm sure your
heart's in the right place,

00:01:18.625 --> 00:01:20.875 align:middle
but what on earth do you think
you'll accomplish on your own?

00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:21.917 align:middle
[LLOYD]
Whatever I can!

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.542 align:middle
[ALKA groans]

00:01:23.625 --> 00:01:26.792 align:middle
[LLOYD] Look, I realize
she'll be mad at me,

00:01:26.875 --> 00:01:30.583 align:middle
and I know you don't want me
to go, that I'm a weakling.

00:01:30.667 --> 00:01:33.625 align:middle
All the same, I have to try!

00:03:10.708 --> 00:03:12.833 align:middle
D-Demon Lord?

00:03:12.917 --> 00:03:16.250 align:middle
Oh, yes! Tremble
in abject terror!

00:03:16.333 --> 00:03:20.375 align:middle
[laughing]

00:03:20.458 --> 00:03:22.500 align:middle
[ALKA] The villagers of Kunlun
do not intervene

00:03:22.583 --> 00:03:25.208 align:middle
in affairs of this nature.
We only concern ourselves with

00:03:25.292 --> 00:03:29.000 align:middle
threats beyond human
comprehension, like demon lords.

00:03:29.083 --> 00:03:32.333 align:middle
This is not a great time
to be zoning out.

00:03:32.417 --> 00:03:33.958 align:middle
[MARIE]
Unbelievable.

00:03:34.042 --> 00:03:35.208 align:middle
[ABADDON]
What?

00:03:35.292 --> 00:03:38.958 align:middle
Why didn't you tell me
what you are sooner?!

00:03:39.042 --> 00:03:42.917 align:middle
Something like you qualifies
as grounds for intervention!

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.708 align:middle
[ABADDON] Not the reaction
I was expecting...

00:03:45.792 --> 00:03:47.958 align:middle
Most folks quail,
or slip quietly into

00:03:48.042 --> 00:03:49.000 align:middle
the depths of despair!

00:03:49.083 --> 00:03:51.042 align:middle
Yeah, well I get
royally pissed off!

00:03:51.125 --> 00:03:52.542 align:middle
If I had known what I
was up against there

00:03:52.625 --> 00:03:54.750 align:middle
would have been no reason
to treat Lloyd the way I did!

00:03:54.833 --> 00:03:56.208 align:middle
Things could have moved
in an orderly fashion

00:03:56.292 --> 00:03:59.167 align:middle
without me having to make
him feel like a burden!

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.750 align:middle
I'm the worst!

00:04:00.833 --> 00:04:04.750 align:middle
Okay. Bizarre choice for
last words, but I suppose--

00:04:04.833 --> 00:04:06.250 align:middle
Hold on, where are you going?

00:04:06.333 --> 00:04:08.042 align:middle
I thought royals
worthy of the title

00:04:08.125 --> 00:04:09.333 align:middle
never backed down from a fight!

00:04:09.417 --> 00:04:10.917 align:middle
People say a lot during
the heat of battle,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.583 align:middle
and that was before I knew this
didn't have to all be on me!

00:04:13.667 --> 00:04:15.458 align:middle
You are going to rue
the day, mister!

00:04:15.542 --> 00:04:18.833 align:middle
What kind of thing is that
to say while in full retreat?

00:04:18.917 --> 00:04:22.792 align:middle
Slow down!

00:04:22.875 --> 00:04:24.542 align:middle
[MARIE]
Time to call in reinforcements!

00:04:24.625 --> 00:04:28.792 align:middle
I've got to find the harpy,
or better yet... Lloyd!

00:04:38.417 --> 00:04:41.167 align:middle
What the-- You're that kid!

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.458 align:middle
Oh, hey, I know you.
We almost fought the other day.

00:04:45.542 --> 00:04:46.875 align:middle
[ALAN laughs]

00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.875 align:middle
Well, this is an embarrassing
situation, isn't it?

00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:54.083 align:middle
So, uh, at first blush you
probably assume I was hiding.

00:04:54.167 --> 00:04:55.792 align:middle
And you would be right.

00:04:55.875 --> 00:05:01.167 align:middle
I'm scared out of my mind.
Ugh, I'm so ashamed.

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.833 align:middle
I've never gone toe-to-toe
with a monster before.

00:05:04.917 --> 00:05:09.417 align:middle
I had no idea what to do.
My body just wouldn't move.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.667 align:middle
[LLOYD gasps]
Been there.

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:18.167 align:middle
I felt the same way with my
first monster. I was petrified.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.333 align:middle
Nothing prepares you
for a moment like that.

00:05:20.417 --> 00:05:21.667 align:middle
[gasps]

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.958 align:middle
[LLOYD] But there's no shame
in being scared.

00:05:24.042 --> 00:05:28.167 align:middle
Fear is just how a soldier knows
they're facing a challenge.

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.750 align:middle
You wanted to become a soldier.
What happened with that?

00:05:32.833 --> 00:05:36.125 align:middle
Guess I wasn't as ready for
the entrance exam as I hoped.

00:05:36.208 --> 00:05:37.458 align:middle
I didn't make the cut.

00:05:37.542 --> 00:05:39.042 align:middle
Doesn't mean I can't
stick around

00:05:39.125 --> 00:05:40.792 align:middle
and do my part, though.

00:05:40.875 --> 00:05:42.625 align:middle
[ALAN]
Behind you! Look out!

00:05:42.708 --> 00:05:45.458 align:middle
Excuse me, we're trying
to have a conversation.

00:05:45.542 --> 00:05:46.458 align:middle
[ALAN]
Huh?!

00:05:46.542 --> 00:05:48.542 align:middle
Point is, monsters
are terrifying!

00:05:48.625 --> 00:05:50.833 align:middle
They can actually
kill you! When--

00:05:50.917 --> 00:05:52.042 align:middle
[ALAN]
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:05:52.125 --> 00:05:54.083 align:middle
You just brushed one off
like it was nothin'!

00:05:54.167 --> 00:05:56.167 align:middle
Uh. Are you talking about
the bug just now?

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.958 align:middle
Say what? That's a bug to you?

00:05:59.042 --> 00:06:01.667 align:middle
Hey, hey! Look at that!
Your body's moving just fine!

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.417 align:middle
[ALAN]
Uh.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.542 align:middle
[LLOYD] Monsters or no monsters,
you're a soldier.

00:06:09.625 --> 00:06:12.708 align:middle
And you're stronger than me.

00:06:12.792 --> 00:06:14.917 align:middle
Anyway, best of luck!

00:06:19.125 --> 00:06:22.833 align:middle
[ALAN] What was that about?
Could he have been serious?

00:06:22.917 --> 00:06:27.625 align:middle
[screaming] Please, no,
don't let it eat me!

00:06:28.667 --> 00:06:31.542 align:middle
[LLOYD] You're a soldier,
and you're stronger than me.

00:06:31.625 --> 00:06:33.833 align:middle
Anyway, best of luck!

00:06:36.833 --> 00:06:38.292 align:middle
[ALAN] Fear is just how
a soldier knows

00:06:38.375 --> 00:06:43.167 align:middle
they're facing a challenge.
And I am a...

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:45.042 align:middle
...soldier!

00:06:49.167 --> 00:06:54.125 align:middle
[ALAN] Okay, then. That wasn't
all that difficult. Heh!

00:06:55.167 --> 00:06:56.542 align:middle
[gasps]

00:07:00.125 --> 00:07:02.750 align:middle
[ALAN] What's with
the giant magic circle?

00:07:02.833 --> 00:07:04.875 align:middle
Ah-ha. Just as I thought,

00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.458 align:middle
these are Abaddon's
ravenous minions.

00:07:07.542 --> 00:07:11.375 align:middle
If a Demon Lord's involved,
I'm obligated to deal myself in.

00:07:11.458 --> 00:07:14.542 align:middle
Though, I'd have done
something anyway.

00:07:14.625 --> 00:07:17.667 align:middle
There's a price for spoiling
my festival date-night

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:21.083 align:middle
with Sir Lloyd. And it is death!

00:07:25.042 --> 00:07:27.500 align:middle
Oopsies! That one's on me!

00:07:27.583 --> 00:07:31.583 align:middle
[MERTHOPHAN, CHROME grunting]

00:07:34.125 --> 00:07:35.750 align:middle
Aw, hell!

00:07:41.125 --> 00:07:42.958 align:middle
No, Riho!

00:07:43.042 --> 00:07:46.792 align:middle
[RIHO] Okay, then, this guy's
strength is on another level.

00:07:46.875 --> 00:07:51.458 align:middle
Hey, how 'bout we quit playin'
for time, call for backup?

00:07:51.542 --> 00:07:53.167 align:middle
Good strategy, I agree.

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:56.750 align:middle
Let us summon Lloyd.
Observe my evocation.

00:07:56.833 --> 00:07:59.500 align:middle
[RIHO]
Oh, no. What are you doing?

00:07:59.583 --> 00:08:01.833 align:middle
I would think it was obvious.

00:08:01.917 --> 00:08:04.583 align:middle
Giving him a foolproof
reason to show up!

00:08:04.667 --> 00:08:07.875 align:middle
Quit dawdling,
Merthophan! Attack me!

00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.583 align:middle
--Huh...?
--She's insane!

00:08:09.667 --> 00:08:11.000 align:middle
[SELEN]
When the maiden is in distress,

00:08:11.083 --> 00:08:12.917 align:middle
the hero appears without fail!

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.625 align:middle
Come, I invite you
to bring me within

00:08:14.708 --> 00:08:16.583 align:middle
a hair's breadth
of crushing defeat!

00:08:16.667 --> 00:08:18.167 align:middle
Should my clothing be
suggestively torn

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:19.625 align:middle
in the process,
so much the better!

00:08:19.708 --> 00:08:21.000 align:middle
That's not how this works!

00:08:21.083 --> 00:08:23.750 align:middle
Please, keep things
tasteful if you would.

00:08:23.833 --> 00:08:25.667 align:middle
[growls]

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:27.333 align:middle
Selen, no!

00:08:27.417 --> 00:08:28.292 align:middle
[laughs]

00:08:28.375 --> 00:08:29.333 align:middle
What?

00:08:29.417 --> 00:08:31.208 align:middle
The attack was blocked
by her belt?

00:08:31.292 --> 00:08:32.833 align:middle
Oh, did I mention?

00:08:32.917 --> 00:08:36.333 align:middle
This charming accessory binds
my fate to that of Sir Lloyd.

00:08:36.417 --> 00:08:40.375 align:middle
Now attack me! Leave me
tattered and half naked!

00:08:40.458 --> 00:08:43.875 align:middle
[SELEN laughing]

00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:47.208 align:middle
[RIHO] Hey, uh, I hate
to criticize your plan,

00:08:47.292 --> 00:08:49.292 align:middle
but I think maybe the
belt isn't cool with

00:08:49.375 --> 00:08:51.292 align:middle
letting this guy
ruin your outfit.

00:08:51.375 --> 00:08:53.958 align:middle
What? No! Stop
defending me so well!

00:08:54.042 --> 00:08:55.792 align:middle
I can't end up nude
in Sir Lloyd's arms

00:08:55.875 --> 00:08:58.292 align:middle
while still fully corseted!
It's a contradiction in terms!

00:08:58.375 --> 00:08:59.708 align:middle
Yeah, whatever.

00:08:59.792 --> 00:09:01.625 align:middle
Look, you're doing a great job
of keepin' him occupied.

00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:04.583 align:middle
Stick with that for now.
I'll go find Lloyd!

00:09:07.083 --> 00:09:08.542 align:middle
[gasps]

00:09:08.625 --> 00:09:11.542 align:middle
Sorry, I know it's late,
but-- Oh, hi, Miss Riho.

00:09:11.625 --> 00:09:13.875 align:middle
Uh, hello?

00:09:16.833 --> 00:09:18.875 align:middle
Aw, what do I do now?

00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.500 align:middle
Can't you at least manage
to expose my shoulder?

00:09:21.583 --> 00:09:22.750 align:middle
[LLOYD]
Miss Selen!

00:09:22.833 --> 00:09:23.708 align:middle
Sir Lloyd!

00:09:23.792 --> 00:09:25.625 align:middle
I'm relieved you're okay!

00:09:25.708 --> 00:09:28.500 align:middle
[SELEN]
I knew you'd come for me!

00:09:28.583 --> 00:09:30.792 align:middle
[LLOYD laughing]

00:09:30.875 --> 00:09:35.000 align:middle
Sir, what are you doing here?
Have you been hurt or something?

00:09:35.083 --> 00:09:38.375 align:middle
Oh, I'll be all right. Question
is, what are you doing here?

00:09:38.458 --> 00:09:41.625 align:middle
I just came to try and help.

00:09:41.708 --> 00:09:44.333 align:middle
[MERTHOPHAN growling]

00:09:52.042 --> 00:09:54.208 align:middle
[LLOYD]
I get it. What's going on here

00:09:54.292 --> 00:09:57.792 align:middle
seems pretty cut and dry.
I'm disappointed in you, sir.

00:09:57.875 --> 00:09:59.750 align:middle
[MERTHOPHAN growls]

00:09:59.833 --> 00:10:02.500 align:middle
[LLOYD] You're a soldier. You're
supposed to serve the king--

00:10:02.583 --> 00:10:04.708 align:middle
[MERTHOPHAN roars]

00:10:04.792 --> 00:10:07.000 align:middle
Don't interrupt me, it's rude!

00:10:07.083 --> 00:10:09.167 align:middle
I'm trying to have a
serious conversation.

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:10.917 align:middle
[MERTHOPHAN grunting]

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.625 align:middle
For me, a soldier's duty
represents a sacred trust.

00:10:15.708 --> 00:10:19.083 align:middle
Their job is to protect people
who can't defend themselves.

00:10:19.167 --> 00:10:21.750 align:middle
Cheesy as it sounds,
I look up to soldiers

00:10:21.833 --> 00:10:24.375 align:middle
who take that trust seriously.

00:10:24.458 --> 00:10:26.125 align:middle
You...

00:10:29.083 --> 00:10:31.042 align:middle
He might actually be
getting through to the guy.

00:10:31.125 --> 00:10:33.500 align:middle
So, what about you?

00:10:33.583 --> 00:10:36.750 align:middle
[MERTHOPHAN]
I-- I don't know.

00:10:36.833 --> 00:10:39.542 align:middle
[LLOYD] What was in your heart
the moment you decided,

00:10:39.625 --> 00:10:42.083 align:middle
when you knew you
wanted to be a soldier?

00:10:42.167 --> 00:10:43.500 align:middle
What did you want?

00:10:43.583 --> 00:10:46.000 align:middle
[MERTHOPHAN]
What was in my heart?

00:10:46.083 --> 00:10:46.958 align:middle
That's right.

00:10:47.042 --> 00:10:49.000 align:middle
Whatever it may have been,

00:10:49.083 --> 00:10:51.458 align:middle
well, I bet it looked
nothing like this.

00:10:51.542 --> 00:10:55.417 align:middle
No, I-- No, it didn't.

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.708 align:middle
Merthophan!

00:10:57.792 --> 00:11:02.083 align:middle
[MERTHOPHAN] I wanted--
I wanted to protect my people,

00:11:02.167 --> 00:11:05.083 align:middle
to preserve the things
that made them happy.

00:11:05.167 --> 00:11:07.250 align:middle
Because they were
your whole world.

00:11:07.333 --> 00:11:09.292 align:middle
[MERTHOPHAN]
I wanted to bring hope,

00:11:09.375 --> 00:11:14.250 align:middle
to deliver them from starvation.

00:11:14.333 --> 00:11:20.250 align:middle
I wanted their lives to be
peaceful. That's all. Peaceful!

00:11:20.333 --> 00:11:21.917 align:middle
Of course you did.

00:11:24.042 --> 00:11:27.500 align:middle
[LLOYD]
And yet, here you are...

00:11:27.583 --> 00:11:29.000 align:middle
...a ranking member
of the military,

00:11:29.083 --> 00:11:31.500 align:middle
so carried away by the festival,
he let himself get drunk,

00:11:31.583 --> 00:11:32.750 align:middle
put on a silly costume

00:11:32.833 --> 00:11:34.292 align:middle
and ran around scaring
people half to death!

00:11:34.375 --> 00:11:36.458 align:middle
[ALL screaming]

00:11:36.542 --> 00:11:38.250 align:middle
Really! You oughta be
ashamed of yourself.

00:11:38.333 --> 00:11:41.458 align:middle
You're so plastered you can't
even form your words properly!

00:11:41.542 --> 00:11:43.333 align:middle
How many drinks did
you serve him?

00:11:43.417 --> 00:11:44.667 align:middle
Huh?

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:48.542 align:middle
[MERTHOPHAN]
I wasn't drinking!

00:11:48.625 --> 00:11:49.500 align:middle
[SELEN]
Uh-oh.

00:11:49.583 --> 00:11:50.792 align:middle
Way to undo all the good

00:11:50.875 --> 00:11:53.125 align:middle
your heartfelt little
speech just did. Bravo.

00:11:53.208 --> 00:11:54.417 align:middle
[CHROME]
Lloyd, please!

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:57.583 align:middle
Take it again from the top
before we lose him!

00:11:57.667 --> 00:11:58.792 align:middle
Take it from the top?

00:11:58.875 --> 00:12:00.417 align:middle
Can't I just skip to
the part about him

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:02.875 align:middle
gettin' hammered and wearin'
that weird-looking outfit?

00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:06.083 align:middle
I wasn't drinking!

00:12:06.167 --> 00:12:10.250 align:middle
Ah, some people just can't
admit when they're wrong.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.417 align:middle
Being called out doesn't
give you the right

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:17.917 align:middle
to act like a jerk.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.500 align:middle
[MERTHOPHAN]
...huh?

00:12:20.583 --> 00:12:21.458 align:middle
Oh, dear.

00:12:21.542 --> 00:12:22.458 align:middle
Uh-- Ah--

00:12:22.542 --> 00:12:23.708 align:middle
Merthophan!

00:12:23.792 --> 00:12:25.417 align:middle
I don't believe it,
he just fell asleep.

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:28.417 align:middle
Oh, by the way, have any
of you seen Miss Marie?

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:30.333 align:middle
The whole reason I'm
here was to find her.

00:12:30.417 --> 00:12:34.500 align:middle
[CHROME] Um, right. She, uh,
ran inside to fight a monster.

00:12:34.583 --> 00:12:36.083 align:middle
By herself? I shouldn't have

00:12:36.167 --> 00:12:38.542 align:middle
wasted so much time here!
I gotta find her!

00:12:38.625 --> 00:12:42.208 align:middle
[MARIE]
Run for your life!

00:12:42.292 --> 00:12:43.167 align:middle
[LLOYD]
Miss Marie?

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:45.750 align:middle
Ahh-- Uh?

00:12:45.833 --> 00:12:47.375 align:middle
[MERTHOPHAN grunts]

00:12:50.625 --> 00:12:53.958 align:middle
I'm so sorry! You said
I'd just get in the way,

00:12:54.042 --> 00:12:55.167 align:middle
and you were right, but--

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:59.083 align:middle
Oh, Lloyd! Thank you
for not listening to me!

00:12:59.167 --> 00:13:01.208 align:middle
Wait, you--
You're not upset I'm here?

00:13:01.292 --> 00:13:04.917 align:middle
Not even a little.
As a matter of fact--

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.417 align:middle
No one dares run
away from Abaddon!

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:08.375 align:middle
[gasps]

00:13:08.458 --> 00:13:12.292 align:middle
[ABADDON panting]

00:13:15.125 --> 00:13:17.583 align:middle
Listen carefully, I don't
mean to frighten you,

00:13:17.667 --> 00:13:20.208 align:middle
but there are monsters nearby.

00:13:20.292 --> 00:13:23.250 align:middle
Um, no offense, but have
you been drinking?

00:13:23.333 --> 00:13:26.292 align:middle
It's just that you're in cosplay
and your eyes look all funny.

00:13:26.375 --> 00:13:28.500 align:middle
Wha... What cosplay?

00:13:28.583 --> 00:13:30.792 align:middle
I'll have you know this
is the real thing!

00:13:30.875 --> 00:13:33.792 align:middle
Ah! Getting rid of that
monster possessing the king

00:13:33.875 --> 00:13:36.000 align:middle
sure took a lot of work!

00:13:36.083 --> 00:13:38.542 align:middle
Wait a minute,
are trying to tell me you--?

00:13:38.625 --> 00:13:40.083 align:middle
Defeated him? Oh, yes.

00:13:40.167 --> 00:13:42.792 align:middle
Things were touch and go there
for a moment, but I managed.

00:13:42.875 --> 00:13:44.167 align:middle
Wait! But she--

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:46.625 align:middle
Of course, then this
snockered imbecile staggers

00:13:46.708 --> 00:13:48.333 align:middle
in while I'm busy trying
to recover from

00:13:48.417 --> 00:13:51.125 align:middle
the fight of my life.
He's so rude.

00:13:51.208 --> 00:13:53.125 align:middle
And wouldn't you know it,
clown that he is,

00:13:53.208 --> 00:13:55.625 align:middle
he starts laying into me
for doing my job!

00:13:55.708 --> 00:13:57.083 align:middle
That is not how it went down!

00:13:57.167 --> 00:14:00.000 align:middle
[MARIE] Note the telltale signs
on his hands and face.

00:14:00.083 --> 00:14:02.417 align:middle
He's stone drunk.

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:04.667 align:middle
Let's at least help him
get cleaned up.

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:07.375 align:middle
Perfect! I know just
what to use. My trick!

00:14:07.458 --> 00:14:09.292 align:middle
Excuse me?

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:13.625 align:middle
[ABADDON] Wait, that's not a
trick! It's an ancient rune!

00:14:13.708 --> 00:14:15.292 align:middle
[laughs]

00:14:15.375 --> 00:14:17.125 align:middle
You stay away from me!

00:14:17.208 --> 00:14:19.375 align:middle
[LLOYD] Don't worry,
you'll feel like a new man!

00:14:19.458 --> 00:14:20.500 align:middle
[grunts]

00:14:21.625 --> 00:14:24.792 align:middle
Aw, c'mon, trust me!
This is for your own good!

00:14:24.875 --> 00:14:27.417 align:middle
Take one step closer, and I--

00:14:28.792 --> 00:14:33.542 align:middle
[screams] I'm fading!
What a world, what a world!

00:14:33.625 --> 00:14:35.958 align:middle
And that is how you
deal with those

00:14:36.042 --> 00:14:37.167 align:middle
tough-to-remove Demon Lords.

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:39.458 align:middle
Curse you all!

00:14:39.542 --> 00:14:42.667 align:middle
Don't act so shocked to
have lost, hateful thing!

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:45.000 align:middle
To mess with my family
is to court ruin.

00:14:45.083 --> 00:14:50.625 align:middle
But... mess with my friends
and you court death, meow!

00:14:50.708 --> 00:14:54.667 align:middle
[ABADDON]
Why did you meow?

00:14:57.708 --> 00:15:01.292 align:middle
[exhales] It is done.

00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:04.125 align:middle
You've been hurt.

00:15:04.208 --> 00:15:05.375 align:middle
Uh.

00:15:05.458 --> 00:15:09.083 align:middle
I'm sorry, I shouldn't
have let this happen.

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:14.917 align:middle
Oh, oh, okay! I, uh, yeah...

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000 align:middle
I'm in your debt forever,
Lloyd. Thank you.

00:15:19.083 --> 00:15:21.125 align:middle
[RIHO]
Sounds personal. Heh.

00:15:21.208 --> 00:15:23.458 align:middle
But you told us that
Lloyd wasn't supposed

00:15:23.542 --> 00:15:25.375 align:middle
to get mixed up in
this nonsense!

00:15:25.458 --> 00:15:27.750 align:middle
[MARIE chuckles nervously]
Woops...

00:15:27.833 --> 00:15:30.250 align:middle
[SELEN] Unhand him and
explain yourself this instant!

00:15:30.333 --> 00:15:32.792 align:middle
I demand answers!

00:15:40.708 --> 00:15:42.208 align:middle
All's well that ends well,

00:15:42.292 --> 00:15:45.417 align:middle
and the Festival's back on
track, so that's good.

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:48.250 align:middle
[SHOMA]
Lloyd?

00:15:48.333 --> 00:15:49.875 align:middle
Oh my gosh!

00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:52.458 align:middle
I just knew it had
to be you! Ha, ha!

00:15:52.542 --> 00:15:57.042 align:middle
[LLOYD laughs]
Shoma! It's been so long!

00:15:59.708 --> 00:16:01.542 align:middle
[LLOYD] What are you doing
out here in the city?

00:16:01.625 --> 00:16:03.708 align:middle
Nothing too exciting,
just delivering some goods

00:16:03.792 --> 00:16:06.958 align:middle
to the local vendors.
But never mind about that.

00:16:07.042 --> 00:16:09.083 align:middle
Look at you,
you've become a giant!

00:16:09.167 --> 00:16:11.042 align:middle
Wow, you're growing so fast!

00:16:11.125 --> 00:16:13.750 align:middle
Word is, you even
took down Abaddon.

00:16:13.833 --> 00:16:15.750 align:middle
That's, like, super intense!

00:16:15.833 --> 00:16:17.875 align:middle
[LLOYD]
Eh?

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:23.917 align:middle
[ALKA]
Lloyd!

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.542 align:middle
[laughing]

00:16:25.625 --> 00:16:26.917 align:middle
Hey there, Chief.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.083 align:middle
[ALKA] Lookie, lookie!
I got us some choco-bananas!

00:16:29.167 --> 00:16:31.250 align:middle
Believe me, they're just divine!

00:16:31.333 --> 00:16:35.500 align:middle
Sorry I left you by
yourself for so long.

00:16:35.583 --> 00:16:37.833 align:middle
I've been with Shoma. Huh?

00:16:37.917 --> 00:16:40.583 align:middle
You don't say, Shoma's around?

00:16:40.667 --> 00:16:44.208 align:middle
Yeah, at least he was
till a second ago.

00:16:44.292 --> 00:16:45.500 align:middle
[ALKA grunts]

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.750 align:middle
[CHOLINE]
The uniform suits you!

00:16:49.833 --> 00:16:52.417 align:middle
Yes, it does indeed. Thanks.

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:56.833 align:middle
[laughs] That look on your face
is giving me worry lines.

00:16:56.917 --> 00:17:00.708 align:middle
So, uh, you're doing
this for Merthophan?

00:17:00.792 --> 00:17:02.208 align:middle
More or less, I suppose.

00:17:02.292 --> 00:17:05.417 align:middle
It's the least I owe for not
being able to stop him.

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:08.667 align:middle
Yes, but... what about
the man himself?

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:10.917 align:middle
You asking as his
colleague or his lover?

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.333 align:middle
[CHOLINE yelps]

00:17:12.417 --> 00:17:16.792 align:middle
[CHROME] Ha! Surely you've not
been trying to hide it?

00:17:16.875 --> 00:17:19.833 align:middle
A word to the wise...
You are the new man on campus,

00:17:19.917 --> 00:17:21.542 align:middle
whereas I, being
chief instructor,

00:17:21.625 --> 00:17:23.083 align:middle
considerably outrank you.

00:17:23.167 --> 00:17:24.875 align:middle
So, you know, just
something to be aware of

00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:26.542 align:middle
when you're trying to be cute.

00:17:26.625 --> 00:17:29.333 align:middle
[CHROME]
Understood!

00:17:29.417 --> 00:17:32.708 align:middle
I'm just curious where he is.

00:17:33.792 --> 00:17:36.583 align:middle
[CHROME] The royal family packed
him off to the boonies.

00:17:36.667 --> 00:17:38.167 align:middle
They felt he needed
an environment

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:39.833 align:middle
that would keep him on his toes.

00:17:39.917 --> 00:17:41.708 align:middle
[MERTHOPHAN yelps]

00:17:41.792 --> 00:17:43.875 align:middle
[ALKA grunts]

00:17:45.167 --> 00:17:47.458 align:middle
This-- This place
is sheer madness!

00:17:47.542 --> 00:17:49.542 align:middle
That's enough
hunter-gatherer for now.

00:17:49.625 --> 00:17:51.042 align:middle
Let's get you over
to the wheat fields

00:17:51.125 --> 00:17:53.500 align:middle
so you can work the land!

00:17:54.958 --> 00:17:57.167 align:middle
[MERTHOPHAN]
I don't-- Wheat fields?

00:17:57.250 --> 00:17:58.500 align:middle
[ALKA]
Impressive, huh?

00:17:58.583 --> 00:17:59.917 align:middle
A Demon Lord spread famine

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.042 align:middle
over the entire continent
a while back.

00:18:02.125 --> 00:18:03.542 align:middle
I used runes to breed
a farm that can

00:18:03.625 --> 00:18:05.958 align:middle
bounce back from locusts
and grow year-round.

00:18:06.042 --> 00:18:08.042 align:middle
Not bad, if I do say so myself.

00:18:08.125 --> 00:18:10.458 align:middle
Manicuring it nonstop
season after season

00:18:10.542 --> 00:18:11.625 align:middle
got to be too much,

00:18:11.708 --> 00:18:13.708 align:middle
so now I just
let it grow freely.

00:18:13.792 --> 00:18:16.083 align:middle
The entire continent?

00:18:22.833 --> 00:18:24.292 align:middle
[MERTHOPHAN]
Did you...?

00:18:25.375 --> 00:18:27.000 align:middle
Was it you who--

00:18:27.083 --> 00:18:30.250 align:middle
who delivered wheat to
starving villagers when--

00:18:30.333 --> 00:18:31.958 align:middle
It was just a
routine precaution.

00:18:32.042 --> 00:18:33.875 align:middle
Should the Demon Lord return,
we don't want him

00:18:33.958 --> 00:18:35.208 align:middle
getting his hooks into desperate

00:18:35.292 --> 00:18:37.750 align:middle
but otherwise well-meaning
people like yourself.

00:18:37.833 --> 00:18:39.583 align:middle
No denying it's hard work,

00:18:39.667 --> 00:18:42.167 align:middle
but I'm sure you're
up to the task.

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:46.250 align:middle
[gasps] Yes, ma'am!

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:50.458 align:middle
[ALKA]
And... action!

00:18:50.542 --> 00:18:53.125 align:middle
[LLOYD gasps]

00:18:53.208 --> 00:18:59.667 align:middle
Heh! Coming in for the close-up,
darling! Just act natural.

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:01.750 align:middle
What in the hell do you
think you're doing?

00:19:01.833 --> 00:19:03.042 align:middle
[ALKA grunts]

00:19:04.875 --> 00:19:07.000 align:middle
Master, tell me this
isn't why you want

00:19:07.083 --> 00:19:08.917 align:middle
Lloyd to become a soldier.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.958 align:middle
[ALKA] Ugh. Oh, lighten up!
You think he's cute now?

00:19:12.042 --> 00:19:14.750 align:middle
Just imagine Lloyd
in full military garb!

00:19:14.833 --> 00:19:17.875 align:middle
In other words, your reasons
are ridiculous. What a shock.

00:19:17.958 --> 00:19:19.833 align:middle
[ALKA]
I'm getting some great shots!

00:19:19.917 --> 00:19:22.417 align:middle
[MARIE] And I'm counting
the second till you leave.

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:25.958 align:middle
Speaking of, are you returning
to the castle anytime soon?

00:19:26.042 --> 00:19:27.542 align:middle
Not just yet, no.

00:19:27.625 --> 00:19:30.958 align:middle
I'm, uh, giving dad a chance
to get back on his feet,

00:19:31.042 --> 00:19:33.750 align:middle
re-familiarize himself
with statecraft.

00:19:33.833 --> 00:19:37.167 align:middle
Well, that and I've gotten
used to this way of life.

00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:41.125 align:middle
No more being a princess
for me, thanks.

00:19:41.208 --> 00:19:43.417 align:middle
[LLOYD]
Sorry it took so long.

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:45.250 align:middle
[gasping]

00:19:45.333 --> 00:19:48.000 align:middle
Congrats on being that
much closer to your dream.

00:19:48.083 --> 00:19:50.083 align:middle
Thanks!

00:19:50.167 --> 00:19:53.208 align:middle
[MARIE] Still, it's not quite
clear who got Lloyd into

00:19:53.292 --> 00:19:56.458 align:middle
the academy. The rumor mill has
it someone was petitioning

00:19:56.542 --> 00:19:58.417 align:middle
for him before Selen and Riho.

00:19:58.500 --> 00:19:59.833 align:middle
[SELEN]
We're here!

00:19:59.917 --> 00:20:01.667 align:middle
Uh?

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:04.333 align:middle
Sorry, give me just a few more
minutes if you don't mind.

00:20:04.417 --> 00:20:06.250 align:middle
[RIHO]
No prob.

00:20:06.333 --> 00:20:09.208 align:middle
[SELEN] You and that uniform
were made for each other!

00:20:09.292 --> 00:20:10.708 align:middle
[ALKA] Sorry, should I
know who you are?

00:20:10.792 --> 00:20:12.792 align:middle
Not unless Sir Lloyd
felt the need to tell you.

00:20:12.875 --> 00:20:14.458 align:middle
Oh, yeah. I haven't
introduced you.

00:20:14.542 --> 00:20:16.333 align:middle
This is Alka,
the chief of my village.

00:20:16.417 --> 00:20:19.500 align:middle
These are my good friends, Riho
and Selen, from the academy.

00:20:19.583 --> 00:20:21.250 align:middle
[ALKA]
How good are we talking here?

00:20:21.333 --> 00:20:23.125 align:middle
Good enough for you
to be worried, sister.

00:20:23.208 --> 00:20:26.292 align:middle
[RIHO] Yo, just a suggestion,
Selen, but maybe this

00:20:26.375 --> 00:20:28.917 align:middle
isn't someone you
ought to provoke?

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.625 align:middle
Hear that, girl?
Listen to your friend.

00:20:30.708 --> 00:20:31.875 align:middle
Thanks for the advice.

00:20:31.958 --> 00:20:34.042 align:middle
What was that you were
trying to do just now?

00:20:34.125 --> 00:20:35.583 align:middle
[ALKA]
Oh, nothing.

00:20:35.667 --> 00:20:38.458 align:middle
I just like to deal with bad
apples as swiftly as possible.

00:20:38.542 --> 00:20:40.208 align:middle
If you find yourself
wracked with tummy aches

00:20:40.292 --> 00:20:41.708 align:middle
for the next few days,
along with that

00:20:41.792 --> 00:20:43.750 align:middle
"ring of fire" sensation
creeping through your

00:20:43.833 --> 00:20:45.542 align:middle
lower GI tract and
out your bum-bum,

00:20:45.625 --> 00:20:47.583 align:middle
that would be the rune-based
curse I just threw.

00:20:47.667 --> 00:20:50.375 align:middle
Ha! I'm sure it would have
been impressively uncomfortable,

00:20:50.458 --> 00:20:52.375 align:middle
but this charming accessory,
which incidentally

00:20:52.458 --> 00:20:54.042 align:middle
also binds me to the
fate of Sir Lloyd,

00:20:54.125 --> 00:20:56.167 align:middle
renders your malicious
magic null and void!

00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:59.333 align:middle
Hold on, that's made
from the skin of Vritra!

00:20:59.417 --> 00:21:01.208 align:middle
Your belt is a
legendary artifact

00:21:01.292 --> 00:21:02.417 align:middle
from the village of Kunlun,

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:04.417 align:middle
designed to protect
the wearer from evil!

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:06.667 align:middle
Wait, then what is it
doing out here?

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:08.708 align:middle
[ALKA]
Actually, that's a long story.

00:21:08.792 --> 00:21:11.125 align:middle
[ALAN] Excuse me!
Good morning, Sir Lloyd!

00:21:11.208 --> 00:21:13.667 align:middle
[LLOYD] Mr. Alan!
Thank you for the help earlier,

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:15.625 align:middle
I really appreciate it!

00:21:15.708 --> 00:21:16.958 align:middle
What'd he do?

00:21:17.042 --> 00:21:19.000 align:middle
Oh, didn't I tell you?
Mr. Alan is how I wound up

00:21:19.083 --> 00:21:21.208 align:middle
getting accepted
into the academy!

00:21:21.292 --> 00:21:22.292 align:middle
[GROUP gasps]

00:21:22.375 --> 00:21:24.583 align:middle
Aw, it was nothing--
really the least

00:21:24.667 --> 00:21:26.833 align:middle
I owed him after what
he did for me.

00:21:26.917 --> 00:21:29.417 align:middle
See, I'd done exceptionally well
in class that afternoon,

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:31.292 align:middle
and the teachers
wanted to reward me.

00:21:31.375 --> 00:21:32.958 align:middle
Naturally, the first
thing I thought of

00:21:33.042 --> 00:21:35.458 align:middle
was asking them to
enroll Sir Lloyd.

00:21:35.542 --> 00:21:37.208 align:middle
I'm surprised you didn't
fall on your knees

00:21:37.292 --> 00:21:38.542 align:middle
and beg for a promotion.

00:21:38.625 --> 00:21:40.042 align:middle
Yeah, well the old me
would have,

00:21:40.125 --> 00:21:41.625 align:middle
but I'm a changed man.

00:21:41.708 --> 00:21:44.542 align:middle
I realize now that being selfish
only gets in the way of helping

00:21:44.625 --> 00:21:46.417 align:middle
the master to his destiny.

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:48.000 align:middle
[RIHO]
Master?

00:21:48.083 --> 00:21:51.208 align:middle
Yes, he resisted my offer out
of modesty, but I'm persistent!

00:21:51.292 --> 00:21:53.875 align:middle
This making anyone else
a tiny bit uncomfortable?

00:21:53.958 --> 00:21:56.875 align:middle
[ALKA whistles]
Stop it! I'm cursing you!

00:21:56.958 --> 00:21:59.083 align:middle
Ha! You think I'm just going
to let you slide by?

00:21:59.167 --> 00:22:01.750 align:middle
What if I just destroy this
whole stupid kingdom instead?

00:22:01.833 --> 00:22:02.833 align:middle
Can your accessory handle that?

00:22:02.917 --> 00:22:04.208 align:middle
[MARIE]
Please don't.

00:22:04.292 --> 00:22:06.583 align:middle
Sir Lloyd! I beg you to take
me on as your protégé!

00:22:06.667 --> 00:22:08.500 align:middle
I'm, uh, kinda busy!

00:22:08.583 --> 00:22:10.000 align:middle
[RIHO]
This is awkward.

00:22:10.083 --> 00:22:11.583 align:middle
[ALKA]
Darling, your hair's a mess!

00:22:11.667 --> 00:22:13.542 align:middle
Stand still and let me
straighten that cowlick.

00:22:13.625 --> 00:22:16.583 align:middle
[LLOYD] That's okay, I can take
care of it myself, thanks!

00:22:16.667 --> 00:22:19.000 align:middle
[ALAN] Here, let me
carry your bags, Master!

00:22:19.083 --> 00:22:22.333 align:middle
Ugh, all of you shut up!

00:22:22.417 --> 00:22:24.250 align:middle
Go home and leave him alone!

00:22:24.333 --> 00:22:26.667 align:middle
And as for the rest
of you morons...

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:28.625 align:middle
Get all your butts to school!

00:22:28.708 --> 00:22:31.875 align:middle
Ha, ha! Right!

00:22:31.958 --> 00:22:33.917 align:middle
Let's go!
