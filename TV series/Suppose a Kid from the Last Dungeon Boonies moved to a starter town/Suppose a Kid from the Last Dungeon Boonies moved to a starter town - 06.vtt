[CROWD cheering]

00:00:34.458 --> 00:00:37.417 align:middle
Where the hell do you get
off brandishing that sword?

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.583 align:middle
It's not a toy!

00:00:38.667 --> 00:00:39.750 align:middle
Well. I, uh--

00:00:39.833 --> 00:00:43.292 align:middle
[CHOLINE]
Okay, she seems really invested.

00:00:43.375 --> 00:00:46.417 align:middle
The sword is rather a sore spot.
It's why she has a prosthetic.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.792 align:middle
[CHOLINE]
Do what?!

00:00:48.833 --> 00:00:51.958 align:middle
If that's the prize,
I shall compete personally!

00:00:52.042 --> 00:00:54.042 align:middle
[CHOLINE]
Huh?

00:00:54.125 --> 00:00:56.625 align:middle
And I won't be playing nice.

00:00:59.875 --> 00:01:03.208 align:middle
Huh. 'Kay, guess we'll be
throwing Lloyd into the mix.

00:01:03.292 --> 00:01:05.708 align:middle
Look, if we're gonna cheat,
we might as well get an A.

00:01:05.792 --> 00:01:07.917 align:middle
Stop making that face.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.292 align:middle
This is wonderful news,
Sir Lloyd!

00:01:10.375 --> 00:01:12.917 align:middle
Not to put more pressure on you,
but I need a favor.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.500 align:middle
Huh?

00:01:14.583 --> 00:01:18.000 align:middle
Please, Colonel, teach me what
you know about healing magic.

00:02:54.333 --> 00:02:56.542 align:middle
[ALKA] And where do you
think you're going?

00:02:56.625 --> 00:02:58.958 align:middle
Specifically? I was
heading to market.

00:02:59.042 --> 00:03:01.750 align:middle
Liar! You're attending the
tournament to watch Lloyd!

00:03:01.833 --> 00:03:03.375 align:middle
You're keeping it
a secret from me

00:03:03.458 --> 00:03:05.333 align:middle
because you know I can't go!

00:03:05.417 --> 00:03:08.375 align:middle
Ugh! Where do you get
your information from?

00:03:08.458 --> 00:03:11.542 align:middle
Oh, look at that,
you're being summoned.

00:03:13.208 --> 00:03:16.208 align:middle
Yeah, I should probably still
curse you just to be safe.

00:03:16.292 --> 00:03:17.792 align:middle
Nothing personal,
you understand.

00:03:17.875 --> 00:03:21.250 align:middle
[MARIE screams] Why do you
always have to be such a harpy?

00:03:21.333 --> 00:03:24.125 align:middle
There. Mild intestinal
spasms every ten minutes.

00:03:24.208 --> 00:03:26.417 align:middle
Unless you grovel non-stop
before the crystal ball,

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.708 align:middle
in which case I'll reconsider.

00:03:28.792 --> 00:03:30.417 align:middle
Toodles!

00:03:31.667 --> 00:03:35.750 align:middle
[MARIE groans]
She can't keep doing this!

00:03:35.833 --> 00:03:39.375 align:middle
Rune magic is too
dangerous! Ugh!

00:03:40.833 --> 00:03:42.625 align:middle
[REFEREE A]
All battles are one-on-one.

00:03:42.708 --> 00:03:45.125 align:middle
The first team to win
twice claims the victory.

00:03:45.208 --> 00:03:46.958 align:middle
Anything may be
equipped for defense,

00:03:47.042 --> 00:03:48.542 align:middle
but you may only
attack with magic,

00:03:48.625 --> 00:03:51.417 align:middle
or magical items such
as staves or stones.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.208 align:middle
Any physical attack
such as punching

00:03:53.292 --> 00:03:56.125 align:middle
or kicking is cause for
immediate disqualification.

00:03:56.208 --> 00:03:58.917 align:middle
Ha. Clearly you scraped
the bottom of the barrel

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.333 align:middle
in choosing that boy.

00:04:00.417 --> 00:04:01.833 align:middle
Ha! Yeah, well that barrel

00:04:01.917 --> 00:04:04.833 align:middle
isn't half as deep as you
think it is, so there!

00:04:04.917 --> 00:04:08.958 align:middle
All right. First two
competitors, come forward!

00:04:09.042 --> 00:04:11.208 align:middle
[SELEN] This girl's behavior
toward Sir Lloyd leaves me

00:04:11.292 --> 00:04:14.667 align:middle
no alternative.
I must break her!

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.000 align:middle
[REFEREE A]
Begin!

00:04:17.083 --> 00:04:19.958 align:middle
[SELEN laughs]
Do you fancy me easily scared?

00:04:20.042 --> 00:04:22.042 align:middle
This belt, i.e. my bond
with Sir Lloyd,

00:04:22.125 --> 00:04:24.042 align:middle
will protect me
against your rock!

00:04:24.125 --> 00:04:25.875 align:middle
Thunder magic.

00:04:30.458 --> 00:04:33.500 align:middle
[SELEN gasping, screams]

00:04:33.583 --> 00:04:35.917 align:middle
What is wrong with you?
Why aren't you reacting?

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.833 align:middle
You have one job--
protect me from all malice!

00:04:38.917 --> 00:04:40.292 align:middle
Is that so much to ask?

00:04:40.375 --> 00:04:42.208 align:middle
Why are you struggling with
that arrangement now?

00:04:42.292 --> 00:04:44.750 align:middle
You're embarrassing me!

00:04:44.833 --> 00:04:46.458 align:middle
[PHYLLO]
And... Flame.

00:04:46.542 --> 00:04:48.958 align:middle
[SELEN screams]

00:04:49.042 --> 00:04:50.875 align:middle
Okay, maybe my tone
was an itsy bit harsh.

00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.917 align:middle
I'm sorry! But still!

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.583 align:middle
[PHYLLO]
Flame. Flame. Flame. Flame.

00:04:57.667 --> 00:04:58.792 align:middle
[SELEN panting]

00:04:58.875 --> 00:05:00.167 align:middle
Come on!

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.792 align:middle
If she's not the personification
of malice, what is?

00:05:02.875 --> 00:05:04.042 align:middle
Thunder.

00:05:04.125 --> 00:05:05.333 align:middle
Any time you feel like
jumping in to ward off

00:05:05.417 --> 00:05:07.167 align:middle
my obliteration,
that'd be great, thanks!

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.375 align:middle
Do you have any idea the
humiliation I've endured

00:05:09.458 --> 00:05:11.208 align:middle
for the past ten years
on account of you?

00:05:11.292 --> 00:05:12.833 align:middle
"Look, there goes
the Belt Princess!

00:05:12.917 --> 00:05:14.000 align:middle
Isn't that getup hilarious?"

00:05:14.083 --> 00:05:15.625 align:middle
The payoff was having
a magical item

00:05:15.708 --> 00:05:17.792 align:middle
act as my guardian, but the
point is totally nullified

00:05:17.875 --> 00:05:20.000 align:middle
if you're going
to be persnickety!

00:05:20.083 --> 00:05:21.583 align:middle
Thunder.

00:05:31.542 --> 00:05:34.833 align:middle
[CROWD cheers]

00:05:34.917 --> 00:05:37.208 align:middle
Achievement unlocked. Ha! Yes!

00:05:37.292 --> 00:05:39.917 align:middle
The belt is tamed;
your powers are useless!

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.333 align:middle
Thunder.

00:05:42.417 --> 00:05:45.833 align:middle
Oh, come! You're only going to
make a spectacle of yourself.

00:05:45.917 --> 00:05:50.333 align:middle
Give up! Now, time for a
blistering counter attack!

00:05:57.833 --> 00:06:00.208 align:middle
I believe the victory
goes to moi?

00:06:00.292 --> 00:06:02.333 align:middle
[PHYLLO grunts]

00:06:02.417 --> 00:06:06.083 align:middle
[REFEREE A]
Stop! Hemein is disqualified!

00:06:06.167 --> 00:06:07.125 align:middle
[ALL]
Huh?

00:06:07.208 --> 00:06:09.000 align:middle
All physical attacks
are prohibited.

00:06:09.083 --> 00:06:11.542 align:middle
That belt is not
a regulation item.

00:06:11.625 --> 00:06:12.500 align:middle
[SELEN gasps]

00:06:12.583 --> 00:06:13.958 align:middle
Quinone wins by forfeit.

00:06:14.042 --> 00:06:17.792 align:middle
[CROWD cheers]

00:06:17.875 --> 00:06:22.583 align:middle
Don't sulk. This isn't over yet.
Victory can still be ours!

00:06:22.667 --> 00:06:24.417 align:middle
[REFEREE A] The next
contestants have entered!

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.333 align:middle
[MENA] Ah, imagine me getting
to fight such a beast.

00:06:28.417 --> 00:06:30.542 align:middle
Yeah well, uh, good match!

00:06:30.625 --> 00:06:32.917 align:middle
[MENA] He took Phyllo down
a peg the other day,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.500 align:middle
but I have my tricks.

00:06:35.583 --> 00:06:37.667 align:middle
Begin!

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:41.125 align:middle
Ha! Now, prepare yourself for
something deliciously fun,

00:06:41.208 --> 00:06:42.958 align:middle
for me, at least.

00:06:48.875 --> 00:06:50.375 align:middle
What's she doing?

00:06:50.458 --> 00:06:53.583 align:middle
That minx. She's pressuring him
to concede before he suffocates.

00:07:01.083 --> 00:07:03.292 align:middle
[MENA] That does it!
I'm calling shenanigans!

00:07:03.375 --> 00:07:05.500 align:middle
He has to be cheating!

00:07:07.167 --> 00:07:10.542 align:middle
Excuse me, Lloyd.
But are you, like, deceased?

00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.542 align:middle
Um, he's alive!

00:07:13.625 --> 00:07:18.125 align:middle
[MENA grunts] My compliments
to your stamina. However!

00:07:18.208 --> 00:07:19.375 align:middle
[gasps]

00:07:19.458 --> 00:07:22.208 align:middle
[MENA]
Isolation magic. Aqua Wall!

00:07:22.292 --> 00:07:23.625 align:middle
[gasps]

00:07:30.667 --> 00:07:32.833 align:middle
A column of water and fog!

00:07:32.917 --> 00:07:35.458 align:middle
It's a decoy tactic
for her next move.

00:07:35.542 --> 00:07:40.458 align:middle
[MENA] O great water, I call
upon thee in the lands beyond.

00:07:40.542 --> 00:07:43.083 align:middle
My words are my sacrifice,

00:07:43.167 --> 00:07:44.917 align:middle
and your power shall
wipe away the...

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.417 align:middle
[LLOYD] She's casting a spell!
I should probably try one, too.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:53.500 align:middle
[LLOYD]
Stir with great fury. Hairy Toe!

00:07:53.583 --> 00:07:56.667 align:middle
[MENA gasping, screams]

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:58.542 align:middle
Mena!

00:07:58.625 --> 00:08:01.042 align:middle
The incantation was
all wrong, but...

00:08:01.125 --> 00:08:05.333 align:middle
...he still forced
Mena to implode!

00:08:05.417 --> 00:08:09.208 align:middle
[LLOYD]
Why can't I remember the words?

00:08:09.292 --> 00:08:11.000 align:middle
And Mena's out of commission.

00:08:11.083 --> 00:08:13.167 align:middle
Making Lloyd Belladonna
the winner!

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:17.208 align:middle
[CROWD cheers]

00:08:17.292 --> 00:08:19.042 align:middle
So strong.

00:08:20.375 --> 00:08:23.375 align:middle
[REFEREE A] Next up,
our last two contestants.

00:08:23.458 --> 00:08:24.833 align:middle
Begin!

00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.125 align:middle
[ROL] I'll give you this, the
magic pouring out of your arm

00:08:30.208 --> 00:08:31.583 align:middle
is nothing to sneeze at.

00:08:31.667 --> 00:08:35.125 align:middle
That said, how long
can you hold up?

00:08:37.292 --> 00:08:39.500 align:middle
[CHOLINE]
Come on! That snake!

00:08:39.583 --> 00:08:42.167 align:middle
She's just wearing Riho out!

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:45.292 align:middle
Just surrender
and call it a day.

00:08:45.375 --> 00:08:47.708 align:middle
Not on your life!

00:08:47.792 --> 00:08:49.083 align:middle
[RIHO grunts]

00:08:56.042 --> 00:08:59.792 align:middle
Heh, my next move
will decide this match.

00:08:59.875 --> 00:09:01.333 align:middle
Defense maneuvers are futile.

00:09:01.417 --> 00:09:04.208 align:middle
I can negate them
without batting an eye.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:09.250 align:middle
Farewell, dear Riho.
You were garbage.

00:09:13.583 --> 00:09:15.042 align:middle
[RIHO grunting]

00:09:15.125 --> 00:09:16.125 align:middle
[BOTH]
Riho!

00:09:16.208 --> 00:09:17.458 align:middle
What have you done to me?

00:09:17.542 --> 00:09:19.208 align:middle
That arm was mine to give you,

00:09:19.292 --> 00:09:21.750 align:middle
and it is mine to take
away as I please.

00:09:21.833 --> 00:09:24.792 align:middle
So sorry, I believe
that's a win for me.

00:09:24.875 --> 00:09:26.833 align:middle
Better luck next time.

00:09:29.792 --> 00:09:31.208 align:middle
[RIHO]
A word of advice:

00:09:31.292 --> 00:09:34.583 align:middle
Never stand within reach of
the person you're taunting.

00:09:42.625 --> 00:09:44.667 align:middle
I-- But you!

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:47.208 align:middle
How the hell did you
just do that?

00:09:49.083 --> 00:09:52.708 align:middle
[RIHO] Just a little something
I picked up from an old friend.

00:09:52.792 --> 00:09:54.167 align:middle
[gasps]

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:55.875 align:middle
[RIHO] You've gotta be careful
about treating injuries

00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:58.792 align:middle
with healing magic. Foreign
objects can be an issue.

00:09:58.875 --> 00:10:00.917 align:middle
Seal a wound up without
first clearing it out,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.375 align:middle
you end up with
all sorts of crap

00:10:02.458 --> 00:10:03.958 align:middle
embedded under the skin.

00:10:04.042 --> 00:10:05.667 align:middle
You might be surprised
how long something

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:07.333 align:middle
like that can go undetected.

00:10:07.417 --> 00:10:11.125 align:middle
Then again, you taught me.
So maybe not.

00:10:11.208 --> 00:10:12.542 align:middle
[gasps] You're mad!

00:10:12.625 --> 00:10:14.167 align:middle
You gouged a hole
in your own flesh

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:16.250 align:middle
and stuffed
a magic stone inside?

00:10:16.333 --> 00:10:17.542 align:middle
You would do that?

00:10:17.625 --> 00:10:19.125 align:middle
Don't get all squeamish on me.

00:10:19.208 --> 00:10:22.375 align:middle
I cast a delayed
healing spell, too.

00:10:22.458 --> 00:10:24.292 align:middle
No! But how?

00:10:24.375 --> 00:10:27.917 align:middle
[RIHO] O great water, I call
upon thee in the lands beyond.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.792 align:middle
You can't be proficient
enough in chant--

00:10:29.875 --> 00:10:31.792 align:middle
[RIHO]
My words are my sacrifice.

00:10:31.875 --> 00:10:34.208 align:middle
May I be the vessel of
your indomitable wrath!

00:10:34.292 --> 00:10:36.458 align:middle
No! Please!
Don't do this, I beg you!

00:10:36.542 --> 00:10:38.667 align:middle
[RIHO]
Heed my words, great waterfall.

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:39.917 align:middle
I call upon thy power!

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.750 align:middle
--I-- I take it all back! Riho!
--Tidal Wave!

00:10:46.833 --> 00:10:49.250 align:middle
[sighs] Hey, what's
the matter with you?

00:10:49.333 --> 00:10:52.500 align:middle
Jeez, you know damn well I
can't use high-class magic.

00:10:52.583 --> 00:10:54.917 align:middle
'Course, when it comes
to lying my ass off,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000 align:middle
I learned from the best.

00:10:57.083 --> 00:11:00.542 align:middle
The winner is Riho Flavin!

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:08.500 align:middle
[ROL] I'm defeated. No matter.
Just a minor setback.

00:11:08.583 --> 00:11:12.000 align:middle
My climb to the top continues.

00:11:12.083 --> 00:11:14.625 align:middle
I crawled my way out of
that filthy orphanage.

00:11:14.708 --> 00:11:16.917 align:middle
I bent over backwards
for a scholarship.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.042 align:middle
I used every trick in the book
to become headmaster.

00:11:20.125 --> 00:11:23.333 align:middle
Throw in the towel over
some idiotic tournament?

00:11:23.417 --> 00:11:24.833 align:middle
Perish the thought.

00:11:24.917 --> 00:11:26.333 align:middle
[SOU]
Indeed.

00:11:26.417 --> 00:11:28.542 align:middle
A shame you don't belong here.

00:11:28.625 --> 00:11:33.167 align:middle
The top is reserved for heroes,
not abject failures.

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:37.208 align:middle
Only those who wield
the Holy Sword may ascend.

00:11:37.292 --> 00:11:41.417 align:middle
All others must resign
to be ruled by them.

00:11:42.917 --> 00:11:47.583 align:middle
[ROL]
Oh, yes. Believe me. I know.

00:11:47.667 --> 00:11:50.083 align:middle
I have only to claim it.

00:11:50.167 --> 00:11:52.917 align:middle
And the world will be mine!

00:11:55.708 --> 00:11:56.708 align:middle
[STUDENT A]
Headmaster?

00:11:56.792 --> 00:11:58.750 align:middle
Yes? What is the sword's status?

00:11:58.833 --> 00:12:00.583 align:middle
Well, according to
the information I have,

00:12:00.667 --> 00:12:03.167 align:middle
Riho Flavin and Selen Hemein
are in the infirmary,

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:05.500 align:middle
so Lloyd Belladonna
is keeping the sword

00:12:05.583 --> 00:12:07.042 align:middle
while they convalesce.

00:12:07.125 --> 00:12:10.792 align:middle
Far from ideal. Ugh, I don't
dare challenge the boy.

00:12:10.875 --> 00:12:12.583 align:middle
Not in my current condition.

00:12:12.667 --> 00:12:14.583 align:middle
[STUDENT A] I have intel about
the person responsible

00:12:14.667 --> 00:12:15.917 align:middle
for extracting the sword.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.167 align:middle
Evidently, it was some shady
underworld character

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:19.875 align:middle
known as "The Witch
of the East Side."

00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:22.583 align:middle
A witch? Give me more details.

00:12:22.667 --> 00:12:24.833 align:middle
[STUDENT A] Seems she's overly
protective of her ward,

00:12:24.917 --> 00:12:26.583 align:middle
sort of an auntie nephew thing.

00:12:26.667 --> 00:12:31.708 align:middle
I see. Let us hope she can be
persuaded over to our side.

00:12:33.208 --> 00:12:34.083 align:middle
[ROL]
Phyllo.

00:12:34.167 --> 00:12:35.292 align:middle
[PHYLLO]
Mm.

00:12:35.375 --> 00:12:37.833 align:middle
Go to Azami at once.
Pay the witch a visit.

00:12:37.917 --> 00:12:41.333 align:middle
Bring me this young ward of whom
she's so "overly protective."

00:12:41.417 --> 00:12:42.792 align:middle
[PHYLLO]
Understood.

00:12:44.875 --> 00:12:47.125 align:middle
All due respect,
is this the job for her?

00:12:47.208 --> 00:12:50.500 align:middle
She owes me on account of her
sister having lost the match.

00:12:50.583 --> 00:12:53.375 align:middle
Besides, she has incentive.

00:12:57.375 --> 00:12:59.875 align:middle
[MARIE grunting]

00:13:01.042 --> 00:13:04.250 align:middle
[MARIE] I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

00:13:04.333 --> 00:13:07.125 align:middle
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

00:13:07.208 --> 00:13:08.875 align:middle
[MARIE whimpers]

00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:13.250 align:middle
[MARIE] Give me a break.
The tsunami is overkill.

00:13:13.333 --> 00:13:14.875 align:middle
[ALKA]
Yay!

00:13:30.042 --> 00:13:31.500 align:middle
What's all the fuss about?

00:13:31.583 --> 00:13:34.083 align:middle
A single kick would have
this thing in pieces.

00:13:34.167 --> 00:13:37.333 align:middle
Oh, yeah, "overly
protective" is right.

00:13:40.417 --> 00:13:44.250 align:middle
Hello, ma'am, I'm home!
D'you want me to--

00:13:44.333 --> 00:13:46.208 align:middle
Miss Marie?

00:13:47.667 --> 00:13:54.000 align:middle
Uh? What the...? She never
just leaves this lying around.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.208 align:middle
[LLOYD] "We have someone
who is precious to you."

00:13:58.292 --> 00:14:00.333 align:middle
"To get them back,
steal the Holy Sword

00:14:00.417 --> 00:14:01.875 align:middle
by whatever means necessary.

00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:04.125 align:middle
Bring it to the lighthouse
on the South Side.

00:14:04.208 --> 00:14:06.292 align:middle
The Quinone Sisters."

00:14:06.375 --> 00:14:07.292 align:middle
Is this...?

00:14:07.375 --> 00:14:09.125 align:middle
[ALAN]
Not to bother you, madam.

00:14:09.208 --> 00:14:12.417 align:middle
But my hemorrhoids have been
flaring up lately-- Oh!

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:13.917 align:middle
Uh, sorry, I--

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.083 align:middle
Something terrible has happened!
Marie has been kidnapped!

00:14:18.167 --> 00:14:19.750 align:middle
[PHYLLO]
Wait. This isn't it?

00:14:19.833 --> 00:14:21.292 align:middle
[ROL]
Of course it's not!

00:14:21.375 --> 00:14:24.333 align:middle
Ugh, I should know better
than to give a halfwit a task.

00:14:24.417 --> 00:14:25.875 align:middle
[STUDENT A]
Headmaster!

00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.583 align:middle
That pipsqueak from
the Witch's house

00:14:27.667 --> 00:14:29.042 align:middle
and some bow-legged nobleman

00:14:29.125 --> 00:14:31.875 align:middle
just showed up
carrying the Holy Sword!

00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:34.458 align:middle
Hey! Excuse me!

00:14:36.917 --> 00:14:39.750 align:middle
Bonus round!

Get down there, now!

Right!

Uh. You're from Rokujou!

00:14:55.542 --> 00:14:58.292 align:middle
[LLOYD] What have you done
with Miss Marie? Tell us!

00:14:58.375 --> 00:15:04.333 align:middle
Who's that? Meh, who really
cares. Let's you and me fight!

00:15:04.417 --> 00:15:06.458 align:middle
[yells]

00:15:11.208 --> 00:15:14.833 align:middle
[laughs] I knew from the moment
you defeated my sister.

00:15:14.917 --> 00:15:17.708 align:middle
You're an adversary worth
fighting to the death.

00:15:17.792 --> 00:15:19.667 align:middle
You're crazy.

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:24.625 align:middle
Heh. A martial artist
can't go out normally.

00:15:24.708 --> 00:15:26.333 align:middle
If you won't take me
on as your protégé,

I'll settle for the next best
thing--letting you kill me!

[LLOYD] I literally don't
understand what you're saying!

00:15:36.792 --> 00:15:38.375 align:middle
Lloyd, look out!

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.583 align:middle
[gasps]

00:15:42.667 --> 00:15:46.833 align:middle
Okay, then. If that's how
you want to play it.

00:15:46.917 --> 00:15:49.208 align:middle
[laughing]

00:15:49.292 --> 00:15:51.417 align:middle
[LLOYD]
But on one condition.

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:55.125 align:middle
If I win, you have to tell me
where to find Miss Marie.

00:15:55.208 --> 00:15:57.208 align:middle
[PHYLLO] If that's what it's
gonna take for you to fight.

Am I even qualified?

00:16:02.375 --> 00:16:04.875 align:middle
She's not after the sword.
She's after me.

00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:06.958 align:middle
I'll guard it well.

00:16:07.042 --> 00:16:09.833 align:middle
[LLOYD] I have to win this
for Miss Marie's sake.

00:16:09.917 --> 00:16:14.042 align:middle
But what are my chances? Back
home, a girl broke my arm once,

00:16:14.125 --> 00:16:15.250 align:middle
and all she did was tap me.

00:16:15.333 --> 00:16:16.625 align:middle
It won't hurt. Promise!

00:16:16.708 --> 00:16:18.333 align:middle
[LLOYD yelps]

00:16:18.417 --> 00:16:21.458 align:middle
[LLOYD]
There's got to be a way...

00:16:23.417 --> 00:16:24.875 align:middle
I challenge you
to arm wrestle!

00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:25.875 align:middle
[PHYLLO]
What?

00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:27.417 align:middle
Like my gramps
always used to say,

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:29.583 align:middle
"in this village, we settle
disputes by sitting down

00:16:29.667 --> 00:16:32.083 align:middle
and grappling, one-armed,
over an apple crate!"

00:16:32.167 --> 00:16:33.583 align:middle
Who's "gramps"?

00:16:33.667 --> 00:16:36.708 align:middle
Grandpa Pyrid, the man who's
raised me since I was a boy!

00:16:36.792 --> 00:16:39.042 align:middle
Wait a minute.
You're from... where?

00:16:39.125 --> 00:16:40.625 align:middle
The village of Kunlun.

00:16:40.708 --> 00:16:44.625 align:middle
[laughs] Of course you are!

00:16:44.708 --> 00:16:46.375 align:middle
That would explain
your strength!

00:16:46.458 --> 00:16:50.000 align:middle
Very well! I'll play by
your village's terms!

Hey! What was that for?

You! Unhand the Holy Sword.

Not a chance! Sir Lloyd

[LLOYD] Uh-oh. The rules

Please marry me.

I know it's sudden, but hear
me out. It makes sense.

You said you're from Kunlun,
yes? You're strong.

00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:23.083 align:middle
You okay?

00:19:23.167 --> 00:19:25.875 align:middle
Better than that. I know
who I'm getting married to.

00:19:25.958 --> 00:19:28.458 align:middle
[MENA]
What?

00:19:28.542 --> 00:19:32.417 align:middle
Ugh! Why is everyone
so damn useless?

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:37.125 align:middle
[ALKA]
Ah, ha! Hello, darling!

00:19:39.667 --> 00:19:40.958 align:middle
Where is my Lloyd?

00:19:41.042 --> 00:19:42.875 align:middle
Uh, I-- Who the hell are you?

00:19:42.958 --> 00:19:44.125 align:middle
I asked you a question!

00:19:44.208 --> 00:19:45.375 align:middle
I don't know!

00:19:45.458 --> 00:19:46.667 align:middle
Where is Lloyd?

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:48.625 align:middle
I don't know and I
don't give a damn!

00:19:48.708 --> 00:19:52.583 align:middle
[ALKA growls] See, I think
you do know and are trying

00:19:52.667 --> 00:19:54.667 align:middle
to drive a wedge between us.

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:56.375 align:middle
Listen to me. I have no idea.

00:19:56.458 --> 00:20:00.667 align:middle
[ALKA]
Where... is... Lloyd?!

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:01.917 align:middle
[ALAN]
What the...?

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.042 align:middle
Whoa! Those were some
serious pyrotechnics!

00:20:04.125 --> 00:20:05.042 align:middle
[gasps] Is that...?

00:20:05.125 --> 00:20:08.167 align:middle
[MENA]
Hm? Headmaster Rol?

00:20:10.375 --> 00:20:13.208 align:middle
Oh, no! Here's your
sword back, Lloyd!

00:20:13.292 --> 00:20:16.292 align:middle
Hey, don't waste your time!
She's the villain.

00:20:16.375 --> 00:20:18.292 align:middle
She needs help!

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:21.083 align:middle
[laughs]

00:20:23.542 --> 00:20:26.042 align:middle
[CHROME]
Not a slow news day, I see.

00:20:26.125 --> 00:20:29.542 align:middle
No kidding. Hey, where do you
have the sword tucked away now?

00:20:29.625 --> 00:20:32.542 align:middle
I thought it best if we kept
it in the castle treasury.

00:20:32.625 --> 00:20:35.583 align:middle
Imagine if we'd thought of
doing that from the start.

00:20:40.375 --> 00:20:45.417 align:middle
There, you'll be just fine. So
long as you get enough rest.

00:20:50.125 --> 00:20:53.458 align:middle
[ROL] Can I pinpoint
where it all went wrong?

00:20:55.792 --> 00:20:58.958 align:middle
Aw, man. I'll never
get this right.

00:21:00.625 --> 00:21:02.125 align:middle
[ROL]
Not with that attitude.

00:21:02.208 --> 00:21:04.542 align:middle
[gasps] Rol.

00:21:04.625 --> 00:21:06.792 align:middle
Hey! What kind of magic are
you teaching me today?

00:21:06.875 --> 00:21:08.583 align:middle
I'm gonna learn about healing?

00:21:08.667 --> 00:21:10.583 align:middle
What did I say?
You're not ready yet!

00:21:10.667 --> 00:21:13.042 align:middle
Healing magic takes
time and dedication.

00:21:13.125 --> 00:21:14.833 align:middle
All sorts of nasty stuff
can go wrong

00:21:14.917 --> 00:21:16.333 align:middle
if you don't know
what you're doing.

00:21:16.417 --> 00:21:18.833 align:middle
Like sealing debris
in a fresh wound.

00:21:18.917 --> 00:21:20.375 align:middle
That sounds cool.

00:21:20.458 --> 00:21:22.542 align:middle
[ROL] Stick with the basics
and work your way up.

00:21:22.625 --> 00:21:25.042 align:middle
You've got potential,
you just need patience.

00:21:25.125 --> 00:21:27.875 align:middle
[RIHO] I just wanna get to where
I can be as helpful as you are.

00:21:27.958 --> 00:21:29.583 align:middle
[ROL] Don't worry,
when I'm headmaster,

00:21:29.667 --> 00:21:31.833 align:middle
we'll get you in
on a scholarship!

00:21:31.917 --> 00:21:33.000 align:middle
Then we can come home

00:21:33.083 --> 00:21:35.292 align:middle
and use what you know
to fix this place!

00:21:35.375 --> 00:21:38.458 align:middle
Oh, we'll do more than that!
Once we're on top,

00:21:38.542 --> 00:21:41.958 align:middle
we're gonna rebuild this
orphanage from the ground up!

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.417 align:middle
[ROL] What happened?
How did I lose sight of that?

00:21:57.333 --> 00:21:59.750 align:middle
[ROL]
Riho.

00:21:59.833 --> 00:22:04.042 align:middle
[RIHO]
Damn it. I'll be back.

00:22:04.125 --> 00:22:08.125 align:middle
[ROL] Look at that.
You've gotten it down to an art.

00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:43.833 align:middle
[SOU] It would appear my master
plan has flown off the rails.

00:23:43.917 --> 00:23:45.875 align:middle
Their memories are
sufficiently altered,

00:23:45.958 --> 00:23:49.875 align:middle
so at the very least I'm under
no threat of being discovered.

00:23:49.958 --> 00:23:53.000 align:middle
The problem is how to
transport the Holy Sword.

00:23:53.083 --> 00:23:54.500 align:middle
Such a quandary.

00:23:54.583 --> 00:23:56.500 align:middle
Sometimes I wonder if my pursuit

00:23:56.583 --> 00:24:00.208 align:middle
of the Last Dungeon
amounts to a fool's errand.

00:24:00.292 --> 00:24:04.167 align:middle
But then my thoughts turn to
Alka, and the glorious day

00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:05.958 align:middle
when I'll kill her.
