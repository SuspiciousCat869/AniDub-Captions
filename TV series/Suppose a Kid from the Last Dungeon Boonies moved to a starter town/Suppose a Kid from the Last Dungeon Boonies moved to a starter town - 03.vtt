00:00:32.375 --> 00:00:37.208 align:middle
[gasping] Miss Marie?

00:00:43.292 --> 00:00:44.792 align:middle
[grunts]

00:00:44.875 --> 00:00:47.000 align:middle
That was a close one.

00:00:48.042 --> 00:00:49.333 align:middle
[MERTHOPHAN]
Where did that thing come from?

00:00:49.417 --> 00:00:50.500 align:middle
[SELEN]
Better yet, where'd it go?

00:00:50.583 --> 00:00:51.542 align:middle
[RIHO]
Lloyd?

00:00:51.625 --> 00:00:53.208 align:middle
[LLOYD]
Oh, I get it.

00:00:53.292 --> 00:00:55.583 align:middle
Miss Marie swooped down
and rescued me.

00:00:55.667 --> 00:00:58.292 align:middle
[inhales] I have no idea
what was going through

00:00:58.375 --> 00:01:00.083 align:middle
your mind back there,
but I'm very disappointed!

00:01:00.167 --> 00:01:04.000 align:middle
I'm sorry, Miss! I-- I promise
it won't happen again!

00:01:04.083 --> 00:01:05.458 align:middle
I'll never be able
to repay you.

00:01:05.542 --> 00:01:08.333 align:middle
You didn't just get me out
of a jam, you saved my life!

00:01:08.417 --> 00:01:09.792 align:middle
[gasping]

00:01:09.875 --> 00:01:11.750 align:middle
Ugh, knock it off, it's not like

00:01:11.833 --> 00:01:14.542 align:middle
that was a life-or-death
situation or anything.

00:01:14.625 --> 00:01:16.000 align:middle
[LLOYD]
Sure it was!

00:01:16.083 --> 00:01:18.500 align:middle
Don't give people so
much credit, Lloyd.

00:01:18.583 --> 00:01:20.708 align:middle
Someone like me
might take advantage.

00:01:20.792 --> 00:01:22.083 align:middle
What? Come on!

00:01:22.167 --> 00:01:24.167 align:middle
You're like the sweetest
person I've ever met!

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.792 align:middle
[MARIE grunts]

00:01:25.875 --> 00:01:27.083 align:middle
[chuckles]

00:01:27.167 --> 00:01:29.458 align:middle
[MARIE screams]

00:01:29.542 --> 00:01:31.167 align:middle
Are you okay?

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.458 align:middle
[MARIE]
Fine, nothing to see here.

00:01:33.542 --> 00:01:35.042 align:middle
[CHROME]
Lloyd!

00:01:41.542 --> 00:01:43.167 align:middle
[CHROME]
Sorry to break up the party,

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.875 align:middle
but I need you back
in the kitchen.

00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:48.333 align:middle
Yessir, on my way now!

00:01:48.417 --> 00:01:51.458 align:middle
So, uh, that little
cyclone was your doing.

00:01:51.542 --> 00:01:52.917 align:middle
Thought it looked familiar.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.667 align:middle
Been awhile, huh, old friend.

00:01:56.917 --> 00:02:00.125 align:middle
An honor, as always,
and a relief to see you.

00:02:00.208 --> 00:02:02.708 align:middle
Things haven't been the same
since you took your leave.

00:02:02.792 --> 00:02:04.833 align:middle
It's good to know that
you're still out there.

00:02:04.917 --> 00:02:07.708 align:middle
What are you doing with
yourself these days?

00:02:07.792 --> 00:02:09.083 align:middle
After you vanished,

00:02:09.167 --> 00:02:11.458 align:middle
I had no choice but to resign
from my post in shame.

00:02:11.542 --> 00:02:14.625 align:middle
I maintain a low profile
working in hospitality.

00:02:14.708 --> 00:02:17.333 align:middle
But it's just a front.
Behind the scenes, I've been

00:02:17.417 --> 00:02:19.333 align:middle
piecing together what
happened to His Majesty.

00:02:19.417 --> 00:02:22.375 align:middle
I see, looks like we
share a pastime.

00:02:22.458 --> 00:02:25.292 align:middle
Thankfully, it's all about
to come to a head.

00:02:25.375 --> 00:02:26.583 align:middle
[gasps]

00:02:26.667 --> 00:02:28.583 align:middle
[MARIE] I'm thinking
the international summit,

00:02:28.667 --> 00:02:31.083 align:middle
third day of the Festival.
Has to be.

00:02:31.167 --> 00:02:32.917 align:middle
Our culprit won't
miss the chance.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.833 align:middle
It's the perfect setup for
declaring war on Jiou.

00:02:35.917 --> 00:02:37.958 align:middle
Unless... we make
the king see reason.

00:02:38.042 --> 00:02:39.958 align:middle
Time's not on our side here.

00:02:40.042 --> 00:02:42.167 align:middle
Do you know who's
pulling the strings?

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.750 align:middle
[MARIE]
Mm-mm.

00:02:43.833 --> 00:02:47.500 align:middle
Not at the moment, no.
I was hoping you could help.

00:02:47.583 --> 00:02:49.792 align:middle
I thought you'd never ask.

00:04:30.583 --> 00:04:33.458 align:middle
Uh-huh, still fine-tuning
the regimen, I see.

00:04:33.542 --> 00:04:35.375 align:middle
You know a break
wouldn't kill ya.

00:04:35.458 --> 00:04:37.583 align:middle
The kingdom's peace
is at stake.

00:04:37.667 --> 00:04:39.667 align:middle
Hey, I know it's none
of my business,

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.375 align:middle
but why are you so
single-minded?

00:04:43.458 --> 00:04:46.750 align:middle
[MERTHOPHAN] You ever known
starvation, Choline?

00:04:46.833 --> 00:04:50.375 align:middle
My hometown was ravaged
by famine when I was young.

00:04:50.458 --> 00:04:51.958 align:middle
It was hell on earth.

00:04:52.042 --> 00:04:54.083 align:middle
What few provisions we
could scrape together

00:04:54.167 --> 00:04:56.083 align:middle
were pillaged by Jiou militants.

00:04:56.167 --> 00:04:57.667 align:middle
We were on the brink
of annihilation,

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.208 align:middle
and they showed us no mercy.

00:05:01.708 --> 00:05:05.375 align:middle
[MERTHOPHAN]
Never again, not on my watch,

00:05:05.458 --> 00:05:08.542 align:middle
not if I have to move
heaven and earth.

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.917 align:middle
[SELEN] I had him!
So close and yet so far.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.042 align:middle
Can't you just see each
other whenever you want?

00:05:16.125 --> 00:05:19.250 align:middle
Yes! Our fates are intertwined!
That's the meaning of Destiny!

00:05:19.333 --> 00:05:22.083 align:middle
Um, it's not, actually,
but never mind.

00:05:22.167 --> 00:05:24.125 align:middle
If we want your knight in
shining armor admitted

00:05:24.208 --> 00:05:25.833 align:middle
to the academy,
we have to track down

00:05:25.917 --> 00:05:27.542 align:middle
this missing princess
and claim the prize.

00:05:27.625 --> 00:05:31.667 align:middle
Thanks, I'm aware of that.
Why do you think we're here?

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.458 align:middle
We need a witch,
particularly one

00:05:33.542 --> 00:05:37.417 align:middle
with a reputation for
peddling information.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.917 align:middle
[LLOYD]
Coming!

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.417 align:middle
Hey!

00:05:45.125 --> 00:05:46.583 align:middle
I simply refuse to believe it.

00:05:46.667 --> 00:05:49.000 align:middle
How could Sir Lloyd consent to
living under the roof of a--

00:05:49.083 --> 00:05:51.333 align:middle
Careful. I take it this is
the first you're hearing

00:05:51.417 --> 00:05:53.542 align:middle
of their, let's call it,
"special arrangement"?

00:05:53.625 --> 00:05:54.625 align:middle
I had no idea!

00:05:54.708 --> 00:05:56.292 align:middle
Sketchy. I thought
the two of you

00:05:56.375 --> 00:05:58.250 align:middle
were supposed to be
boyfriend and girlfriend.

00:05:58.333 --> 00:06:01.833 align:middle
We are! We're deeply in love!
Our destinies bind us together!

00:06:01.917 --> 00:06:03.333 align:middle
And while it's only been a week,

00:06:03.417 --> 00:06:05.458 align:middle
I shall remember the day we
met for the rest of my life!

00:06:05.542 --> 00:06:08.708 align:middle
[RIHO]
Wait, it's only been a week?

00:06:08.792 --> 00:06:10.917 align:middle
[LLOYD] Give it a sec,
it's fresh off the stove.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.833 align:middle
I will show the utmost deferred
gratification, Sir Lloyd!

00:06:13.917 --> 00:06:15.917 align:middle
[RIHO] I think I've got
this figured out.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.875 align:middle
Lloyd's power must've somehow
unlocked her chastity belt,

00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.250 align:middle
or whatever that thing is,

00:06:20.333 --> 00:06:22.458 align:middle
and now she thinks
they're "meant to be."

00:06:22.542 --> 00:06:24.917 align:middle
Bad enough he could rip me
apart at a moment's notice.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.708 align:middle
Now I've got to worry about her
throwing hands to protect him?

00:06:27.792 --> 00:06:30.333 align:middle
[MARIE] I'm home!
And not a moment too soon.

00:06:30.417 --> 00:06:32.417 align:middle
Lloyd, if you could work your
ice magic on some beer,

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:33.625 align:middle
that'd be great.

00:06:33.708 --> 00:06:35.542 align:middle
[LLOYD] Sure thing!
You want some edamame?

00:06:35.625 --> 00:06:37.792 align:middle
Ooh, that sounds delish--!

00:06:37.875 --> 00:06:39.250 align:middle
Why are you entertaining guests?

00:06:39.333 --> 00:06:41.250 align:middle
Oh, these are just some
friends from the academy,

00:06:41.333 --> 00:06:42.750 align:middle
Riho and Selen!

00:06:42.833 --> 00:06:44.083 align:middle
Hey, what's up?

00:06:44.167 --> 00:06:46.625 align:middle
And apparently I'm
his "friend," Selen.

00:06:46.708 --> 00:06:48.750 align:middle
Sorry to intrude like this.

00:06:48.833 --> 00:06:50.458 align:middle
[MARIE]
What's wrong with her eyes?

00:06:50.542 --> 00:06:51.833 align:middle
Um, technically they stopped by

00:06:51.917 --> 00:06:53.583 align:middle
to pick your brain
about something.

00:06:53.667 --> 00:06:55.625 align:middle
Well, they've come to
the right place, then.

00:06:55.708 --> 00:06:59.833 align:middle
[RIHO] Hang on, I've seen
that face before.

00:07:01.542 --> 00:07:03.583 align:middle
What exactly is it
you'd like to know?

00:07:03.667 --> 00:07:05.417 align:middle
We're trying to pinpoint
the current whereabouts

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:11.375 align:middle
of a certain missing person.
This is the last known photo.

00:07:11.458 --> 00:07:14.125 align:middle
Whatever you've got, we'll pay.

00:07:14.208 --> 00:07:16.250 align:middle
[MARIE] Sorry, but I'm afraid
missing princesses

00:07:16.333 --> 00:07:17.833 align:middle
aren't my area of expertise.

00:07:17.917 --> 00:07:20.458 align:middle
Oh, yeah? When did I say
she was a princess?

00:07:20.542 --> 00:07:23.000 align:middle
Uhh, you didn't,
I just made a guess?

00:07:23.083 --> 00:07:24.917 align:middle
[RIHO] I can't quite
put my finger on it,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.625 align:middle
but something's off.

00:07:26.708 --> 00:07:29.667 align:middle
[MARIE] Pull yourself together,
woman! They're onto you!

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:32.208 align:middle
[RIHO]
Who does she remind me of?

00:07:32.292 --> 00:07:35.000 align:middle
[SELEN]
So! I'm curious, Miss Marie.

00:07:35.083 --> 00:07:37.042 align:middle
Tell us more about yourself!

00:07:37.125 --> 00:07:38.292 align:middle
Uhh...

00:07:38.375 --> 00:07:40.833 align:middle
Like how long you've
lived here, for example.

00:07:40.917 --> 00:07:42.458 align:middle
Um, about two years?

00:07:42.542 --> 00:07:44.125 align:middle
[SELEN]
Two years!

00:07:46.208 --> 00:07:47.250 align:middle
Uh?

00:07:47.333 --> 00:07:49.750 align:middle
[MARIE]
Oh, no, what have I done?

00:07:49.833 --> 00:07:53.417 align:middle
Look at me, a royal princess
playing dress up,

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.125 align:middle
all while her father
lets himself

00:07:55.208 --> 00:07:58.208 align:middle
be talked into waging war.

00:07:58.292 --> 00:08:00.417 align:middle
I won't say that
I'm not crushed,

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:01.667 align:middle
but don't think me so crushed

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:04.500 align:middle
I haven't the strength
to demand the truth!

00:08:04.583 --> 00:08:08.250 align:middle
[MARIE] She's so determined.
What kind of princess would I be

00:08:08.333 --> 00:08:13.167 align:middle
to ignore the tears of such a
passionate, steadfast citizen?

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:16.792 align:middle
Very well. There's no
point in denying it.

00:08:16.875 --> 00:08:17.917 align:middle
Go on.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.375 align:middle
I am the one you seek.
It's me.

00:08:19.458 --> 00:08:21.375 align:middle
But are you married
to Sir Lloyd?

00:08:21.458 --> 00:08:23.167 align:middle
Are... you good?

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:25.625 align:middle
[RIHO] It should not have taken
me this long to realize it.

00:08:25.708 --> 00:08:28.500 align:middle
Married? Heh! God no,
nothing like that!

00:08:28.583 --> 00:08:31.000 align:middle
We have more of an
auntie-nephew relationship.

00:08:31.083 --> 00:08:32.208 align:middle
So you aren't involved!

00:08:32.292 --> 00:08:33.958 align:middle
Whoa, whoa, can we back
up a second, please?

00:08:34.042 --> 00:08:35.292 align:middle
You're the one we seek?

00:08:35.375 --> 00:08:37.458 align:middle
Whatever are you talking about?
I didn't say that!

00:08:37.542 --> 00:08:41.625 align:middle
What I meant was, dear oh
dear, look at that stain!

00:08:41.708 --> 00:08:43.250 align:middle
[SELEN]
Okay, let's start over.

00:08:43.333 --> 00:08:45.083 align:middle
Anything you have
regarding the princess

00:08:45.167 --> 00:08:46.417 align:middle
would be appreciated.

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:49.583 align:middle
It's imperative we find her
as soon as possible!

00:08:49.667 --> 00:08:51.167 align:middle
But why do you care?

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:52.708 align:middle
Because the reward
for finding her

00:08:52.792 --> 00:08:55.625 align:middle
is Sir Lloyd's enrollment
into the military academy!

00:08:55.708 --> 00:08:57.000 align:middle
[gasps]

00:08:58.833 --> 00:09:01.583 align:middle
Oh, so you're
doing this for him!

00:09:01.667 --> 00:09:02.917 align:middle
[RIHO]
Hmm...

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.333 align:middle
Uh! I propose that we work
this out quid pro quo.

00:09:07.417 --> 00:09:09.125 align:middle
You mean, like a trade?

00:09:09.208 --> 00:09:11.000 align:middle
[MARIE]
Information for information.

00:09:11.083 --> 00:09:13.250 align:middle
You keep me up to date on
the king, the academy,

00:09:13.333 --> 00:09:15.458 align:middle
the military--I want details,

00:09:15.542 --> 00:09:17.917 align:middle
however insignificant
or frivolous.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.458 align:middle
Anything. Our kingdom
is in grave danger

00:09:20.542 --> 00:09:21.917 align:middle
unless we do something.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.167 align:middle
Strikes me as a fair deal,

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:25.083 align:middle
there's just one,
tiny little problem.

00:09:25.167 --> 00:09:28.417 align:middle
Who are you really? Come clean.

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.708 align:middle
Yes, of course.
I imagine you've already

00:09:30.792 --> 00:09:34.625 align:middle
figured it out.
You do know, right?

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.458 align:middle
[LLOYD]
They're not the only ones.

00:09:38.542 --> 00:09:42.250 align:middle
I've had my suspicions for a
while. Sorry, ma'am, no offense.

00:09:42.333 --> 00:09:43.667 align:middle
[MARIE, RIHO gasp]

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.458 align:middle
[LLOYD] I didn't want to
say anything because I

00:09:45.542 --> 00:09:49.917 align:middle
wasn't certain. But now?
Well, there's no doubt.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.500 align:middle
Who do you think...?

00:09:51.583 --> 00:09:53.958 align:middle
The hero! You're the
savior of this kingdom!

00:09:54.042 --> 00:09:55.625 align:middle
Sweetie, what are you
talking about?

00:09:55.708 --> 00:09:57.958 align:middle
Please, Miss! It's no
use trying to hide it!

00:09:58.042 --> 00:10:00.708 align:middle
I knew who you were the moment
you rescued me from that fight!

00:10:00.792 --> 00:10:02.250 align:middle
I'm not following.

00:10:02.333 --> 00:10:04.875 align:middle
I saw you sneak into a back
alley where only moments later

00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.500 align:middle
someone single-handedly
defeated a vicious monster!

00:10:07.583 --> 00:10:09.042 align:middle
Lloyd, I really don't know.

00:10:09.125 --> 00:10:11.083 align:middle
[LLOYD] And you didn't even
stick around to take the credit!

00:10:11.167 --> 00:10:13.875 align:middle
You've been defending the city
in secret this whole time,

00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.333 align:middle
just like a hero would!

00:10:15.417 --> 00:10:16.417 align:middle
Oh dear.

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:17.667 align:middle
Look, miss, please.

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:20.667 align:middle
You said the kingdom's
in danger. Well, then--

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:25.167 align:middle
Let me fight alongside you to
protect it! I'm begging you!

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:27.000 align:middle
You mean that?

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:35.250 align:middle
[MARIE laughs]
Oh, Lloyd, oh honey.

00:10:35.333 --> 00:10:36.667 align:middle
What's so funny?

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:39.083 align:middle
[MARIE]
You've got me dead to rights.

00:10:39.167 --> 00:10:43.000 align:middle
I am she. Marie,
the Legendary Savior.

00:10:43.083 --> 00:10:46.000 align:middle
Hey! What are you
playing at here?

00:10:49.125 --> 00:10:51.167 align:middle
And as the Savior, it is my duty

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:53.917 align:middle
to tell you you're
not strong enough.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.250 align:middle
That doesn't mean
I can't help you!

00:10:56.333 --> 00:10:59.250 align:middle
Yes, I'm a weakling. I get it,
okay, but the person I want

00:10:59.333 --> 00:11:00.958 align:middle
to be wouldn't
let that stop them!

00:11:01.042 --> 00:11:03.792 align:middle
And if you give me an
opportunity, I can improve!

00:11:03.875 --> 00:11:06.833 align:middle
Whatever it takes, I'm game!
I'll do my absolute best!

00:11:06.917 --> 00:11:12.167 align:middle
[MARIE] Shut up! A rousing
speech isn't going to cut it.

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:14.417 align:middle
It doesn't matter what you
think you're capable of.

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:17.083 align:middle
Reality doesn't care how
badly you want to be a hero.

00:11:17.167 --> 00:11:19.417 align:middle
You don't have-- [gasps]

00:11:27.792 --> 00:11:32.167 align:middle
I know it's harsh, but the truth
is you'd only get in the way.

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:36.292 align:middle
I stepped out of line.
I apologize.

00:11:39.542 --> 00:11:41.042 align:middle
She didn't mean--

00:11:41.125 --> 00:11:43.083 align:middle
[MARIE sighs] I'm glad you
were here to see that.

00:11:43.167 --> 00:11:45.417 align:middle
It helps drive home the point.

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:47.000 align:middle
I need your help.

00:11:47.083 --> 00:11:51.375 align:middle
The warmongers must be
stopped before it's too late.

00:11:51.458 --> 00:11:56.917 align:middle
I ask, not as a witch,
but a princess: Maria Azami.

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:02.875 align:middle
[SELEN] You mean to tell us
you're the missing princess?

00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.625 align:middle
You'll have to excuse
my associate,

00:12:04.708 --> 00:12:07.083 align:middle
she's not the sharpest saber
in the armory rack.

00:12:07.167 --> 00:12:10.000 align:middle
But anyway, I'm glad you
found it in your heart

00:12:10.083 --> 00:12:13.333 align:middle
to be square with us.
Just one question.

00:12:13.417 --> 00:12:15.542 align:middle
You know damn good and well
that kid is a powerhouse!

00:12:15.625 --> 00:12:17.583 align:middle
Why the hell would you
treat him that way?

00:12:17.667 --> 00:12:19.333 align:middle
For crying out loud,
you live together!

00:12:19.417 --> 00:12:21.750 align:middle
You of all people must know
what he's capable of!

00:12:21.833 --> 00:12:24.167 align:middle
And to think you're of noble
blood! Refusing the aid

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:25.750 align:middle
of so gifted a warrior
when your kingdom

00:12:25.833 --> 00:12:27.542 align:middle
hangs in the balance
is unconscionable!

00:12:27.625 --> 00:12:29.625 align:middle
That's hardly the conduct
of a royal princess!

00:12:29.708 --> 00:12:31.125 align:middle
Appreciate the input, Selen,

00:12:31.208 --> 00:12:33.500 align:middle
but the grownups are talking,
so maybe just don't.

00:12:33.583 --> 00:12:35.083 align:middle
[SELEN] Um, excuse me,
it just so happens

00:12:35.167 --> 00:12:36.250 align:middle
I was trying to make a point.

00:12:36.333 --> 00:12:37.917 align:middle
[RIHO]
So was I when you chimed in!

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.542 align:middle
[SELEN] Because it seemed
like the appropriate place

00:12:39.625 --> 00:12:40.792 align:middle
to bring up mine!

00:12:40.875 --> 00:12:43.208 align:middle
--[RIHO growls] Don't laugh!
--[laughs]

00:12:43.292 --> 00:12:45.083 align:middle
Sorry, I didn't mean to be rude.

00:12:45.167 --> 00:12:46.750 align:middle
It's just nice to see
the two of you

00:12:46.833 --> 00:12:48.333 align:middle
get worked up over
Lloyd like this.

00:12:48.417 --> 00:12:49.583 align:middle
Am not!

00:12:50.542 --> 00:12:53.375 align:middle
I don't suppose you're familiar
with the village of Kunlun?

00:12:53.458 --> 00:12:55.042 align:middle
[SELEN]
From the fairy tale?

00:12:55.125 --> 00:12:56.250 align:middle
[RIHO]
Sure, I've heard the name.

00:12:56.333 --> 00:12:58.708 align:middle
I assure you it's real,
and believe it or not,

00:12:58.792 --> 00:13:00.500 align:middle
that's where Lloyd is from.

00:13:00.583 --> 00:13:03.333 align:middle
You've got to be kidding.
But then again,

00:13:03.417 --> 00:13:05.917 align:middle
that would explain
the origin of Lloyd's power.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.625 align:middle
When it comes to
worldly matters,

00:13:07.708 --> 00:13:10.208 align:middle
Kunlun imposes a strict
rule of detachment.

00:13:10.292 --> 00:13:13.042 align:middle
The villagers stay out
of human affairs.

00:13:13.125 --> 00:13:16.625 align:middle
That's why Lloyd can't
get mixed up in this.

00:13:16.708 --> 00:13:18.542 align:middle
If he's caught intervening,

00:13:18.625 --> 00:13:21.167 align:middle
he'll be forced to give up
his dream and go home.

00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:23.042 align:middle
I will not let it come to that!

00:13:23.125 --> 00:13:25.625 align:middle
So that's what your
little scene was about.

00:13:25.708 --> 00:13:27.583 align:middle
Right now, cadets
and street thugs are

00:13:27.667 --> 00:13:30.583 align:middle
tearing the Central Zone apart.
They're hastily searching for me

00:13:30.667 --> 00:13:33.000 align:middle
on the assumption I'm
an enemy of the people.

00:13:33.083 --> 00:13:36.167 align:middle
The conditions of my capture,
according to the rumor mill are,

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:39.583 align:middle
and I quote,
"Wanted dead or alive."

00:13:39.667 --> 00:13:41.583 align:middle
[RIHO] That's a slap
in the face, huh?

00:13:41.667 --> 00:13:44.000 align:middle
[SELEN] Who would issue
such a vile decree?

00:13:44.083 --> 00:13:46.875 align:middle
[MARIE] Most likely whoever's
advocating for war.

00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.792 align:middle
The last thing they want
is for me to become

00:13:48.875 --> 00:13:52.583 align:middle
a rallying point for
the opposition.

00:13:52.667 --> 00:13:55.250 align:middle
[MARIE]
Hence my excess of caution.

00:13:55.333 --> 00:13:57.042 align:middle
Hence why you need our help.

00:13:57.125 --> 00:13:59.333 align:middle
[MARIE]
Can I count on you?

00:14:00.917 --> 00:14:02.917 align:middle
Eh, why not. You only live once.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.083 align:middle
I can think of worse things than
having a royal owe me a favor.

00:14:06.167 --> 00:14:08.417 align:middle
I'll help because
it's the right thing.

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:10.208 align:middle
Thank you both.

00:14:11.625 --> 00:14:14.250 align:middle
[LLOYD]
Yeah. Deep down I always knew

00:14:14.333 --> 00:14:18.875 align:middle
it would never really happen.
I just don't have what it takes.

00:14:28.583 --> 00:14:30.500 align:middle
[MARIE]
Focus, Marie.

00:14:30.583 --> 00:14:34.375 align:middle
Invoke the Disenchant rune
and release your father.

00:14:37.708 --> 00:14:39.125 align:middle
[MARIE]
You can do this.

00:14:39.208 --> 00:14:40.458 align:middle
Hello, dear.

00:14:40.542 --> 00:14:42.833 align:middle
[MARIE] Master!
Oh, what a pleasant surprise!

00:14:42.917 --> 00:14:44.833 align:middle
Forgive me,
I was eavesdropping.

00:14:44.917 --> 00:14:46.625 align:middle
Though, I am pleased
you're committed

00:14:46.708 --> 00:14:48.958 align:middle
to keeping Lloyd out
of this as I asked.

00:14:49.042 --> 00:14:52.000 align:middle
No, no, forgive me for ever
giving you cause to fret!

00:14:52.083 --> 00:14:55.250 align:middle
You're right, it's my problem.
I should fix it myself!

00:14:55.333 --> 00:14:57.667 align:middle
[ALKA]
Indeed.

00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:00.958 align:middle
Was it necessary to throw
my crystal down the well,

00:15:01.042 --> 00:15:02.875 align:middle
or just spite?

00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:04.167 align:middle
[MARIE gasping]

00:15:06.125 --> 00:15:08.708 align:middle
Quite the jarring experience,
I can tell you!

00:15:08.792 --> 00:15:11.542 align:middle
One moment, I'm contemplating
a friendly visit, and the next,

00:15:11.625 --> 00:15:15.292 align:middle
I'm thrashing about
like a wounded mermaid!

00:15:15.375 --> 00:15:17.833 align:middle
[MARIE] A rare lapse
in judgment, master.

00:15:17.917 --> 00:15:20.875 align:middle
I wasn't in my right mind.
Please don't--

00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.750 align:middle
Oh, I'm not mad, you're fine!

00:15:22.833 --> 00:15:25.542 align:middle
Nothing an innocent curse won't
fix. Incidentally, you'll now

00:15:25.625 --> 00:15:28.125 align:middle
finish every tenth
sentence with "meow."

00:15:28.208 --> 00:15:29.375 align:middle
Also, just so you know,

00:15:29.458 --> 00:15:32.083 align:middle
I'll be taking Lloyd to
the Foundation Festival.

00:15:32.167 --> 00:15:34.792 align:middle
Ta-ta! If you'll excuse me,
I have to get ready!

00:15:34.875 --> 00:15:38.625 align:middle
I-- Master! Surely
now isn't the time

00:15:38.708 --> 00:15:43.583 align:middle
for a night of fun
and frolic? Meow!

00:15:51.208 --> 00:15:54.958 align:middle
[THUG A] Hey! Look, I'm telling
you I never laid eyes on him.

00:15:55.042 --> 00:15:57.708 align:middle
All I know is he kept
repeating the same phrase!

00:15:57.792 --> 00:15:59.042 align:middle
[RIHO]
Go on.

00:15:59.125 --> 00:16:02.125 align:middle
It was weird, something
about the need for peace!

00:16:07.458 --> 00:16:11.375 align:middle
[ALKA gasping]
This is so exciting!

00:16:13.667 --> 00:16:17.000 align:middle
[ALKA] Aw, he's still
depressed. Poor fella.

00:16:17.083 --> 00:16:18.500 align:middle
Can't say I blame him.

00:16:18.583 --> 00:16:22.083 align:middle
The kingdom's in peril and he
can't do a thing about it.

00:16:22.167 --> 00:16:26.000 align:middle
Tough to take when you have a
firm sense of right and wrong.

00:16:26.083 --> 00:16:30.667 align:middle
He's so sad.
It's just... just...

00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:34.083 align:middle
Such an absolute perfect setup!

00:16:34.167 --> 00:16:35.458 align:middle
[VENDOR gasps]

00:16:35.542 --> 00:16:37.417 align:middle
[ALKA] I get to be the lucky
so-and-so to snatch him

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:39.792 align:middle
from the jaws of despair!

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.625 align:middle
[ALKA] When I'm done,
he'll associate me

00:16:43.708 --> 00:16:45.583 align:middle
with good times
and happy thoughts!

00:16:45.667 --> 00:16:50.292 align:middle

00:16:50.375 --> 00:16:53.542 align:middle
Okay, what shall
we do next, Lloyd?

00:16:56.750 --> 00:17:01.458 align:middle
Ah, of course!
I know just the thing!

00:17:01.542 --> 00:17:06.458 align:middle
Prepare your taste buds!
It's Choco-banana Yum Time!

00:17:06.542 --> 00:17:08.750 align:middle
So sinful you could just die!

00:17:08.833 --> 00:17:10.208 align:middle
Okay.

00:17:10.292 --> 00:17:13.917 align:middle
[ALKA] Apologies in advance
for your outfit.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.208 align:middle
This stuff gets everywhere!

[CHROME]
If it pleases Your Majesty,

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.750 align:middle
I'd like to be reinstated
into military service.

00:17:31.833 --> 00:17:32.875 align:middle
Did he...?

00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:35.833 align:middle
Will that be all?
You have been heard.

00:17:35.917 --> 00:17:38.875 align:middle
Doubtless, the king will
duly consider your request.

00:17:38.958 --> 00:17:41.917 align:middle
He'll respond in his own time.
Return home and await news.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.375 align:middle
[CHROME]
Have I been heard?

00:17:43.458 --> 00:17:45.250 align:middle
[gasps] Of course.

00:17:45.333 --> 00:17:49.875 align:middle
Fine, this didn't come from me,
but I've seen the princess.

00:17:49.958 --> 00:17:51.958 align:middle
She and her ragtag
band of cohorts

00:17:52.042 --> 00:17:54.417 align:middle
are adamant the king
is under a spell.

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:56.500 align:middle
They intend to flush out
the evildoer before

00:17:56.583 --> 00:18:00.208 align:middle
His Majesty can be goaded
into declaring war on Jiou.

00:18:00.292 --> 00:18:02.958 align:middle
Upon their search,
they've discovered a vital clue.

00:18:03.042 --> 00:18:05.333 align:middle
It seems the culprit enlisted
several street thugs

00:18:05.417 --> 00:18:06.667 align:middle
to apprehend the princess,

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:09.500 align:middle
and in so doing used
the following words:

00:18:09.583 --> 00:18:12.958 align:middle
"Bring her back at all
costs, dead or alive."

00:18:13.042 --> 00:18:15.333 align:middle
He also said, "for the
peace of our kingdom,"

00:18:15.417 --> 00:18:17.625 align:middle
over and over again.

I've heard that before.

Let's not play games with
each other. You're their man.

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:27.375 align:middle
--Correct.
--But why?

00:18:27.458 --> 00:18:29.167 align:middle
[MERTHOPHAN]
Simple foresight.

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:31.625 align:middle
A ruler who delegates
his kingdom to fools

00:18:31.708 --> 00:18:35.917 align:middle
cannot tell enemy from ally.
He's more prop than sovereign.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.958 align:middle
Why not let him be a prop
for the greater good?

00:18:39.042 --> 00:18:41.375 align:middle
[RIHO] What's the difference
between a villain monologue

00:18:41.458 --> 00:18:42.500 align:middle
and a confession?

00:18:42.583 --> 00:18:44.375 align:middle
[SELEN]
Your audience.

00:18:44.458 --> 00:18:48.375 align:middle
[MERTHOPHAN] Riho Flavin.
Selen Hemein. Why are you two--

00:18:48.458 --> 00:18:52.708 align:middle
It's not nice to meet you, but
it does give a sense of closure.

00:18:52.792 --> 00:18:56.292 align:middle
Call me Maria. If you prefer
a professional title,

00:18:56.375 --> 00:18:58.208 align:middle

00:19:14.125 --> 00:19:18.875 align:middle
I told you, the king
you see is only a prop--

00:19:18.958 --> 00:19:20.833 align:middle
Foolish cretin. Ha!

00:19:20.917 --> 00:19:24.042 align:middle
Let no man presume to
be in control of me.

00:19:24.125 --> 00:19:25.750 align:middle
You are under my power.

00:19:25.833 --> 00:19:28.333 align:middle

[MERTHOPHAN grunting]

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:31.833 align:middle
[ABADDON] I orchestrated
the attack on your village

00:19:31.917 --> 00:19:33.333 align:middle
all those years ago.

00:19:33.417 --> 00:19:37.000 align:middle
Your hatred of the Jiou
Empire is my design.

still get your precious war.

Aw, such a shame.

have been yours. However--

here tonight, Princess.

Royals worthy of the title don't
easily lie down and die.

[ABADDON]
An admirable sentiment.

But alas, it's all for naught.

and gnash in the clutches

the demon lord, Abaddon!
