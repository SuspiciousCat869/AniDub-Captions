00:00:37.208 --> 00:00:40.500 align:middle
Whoa! The stars are
absolutely beautiful!

00:00:40.583 --> 00:00:42.250 align:middle
[MARIE giggles]
Aw...

00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:43.375 align:middle
If I haven't told you yet,

00:00:43.458 --> 00:00:45.000 align:middle
thanks for coming
out here with us.

00:00:45.083 --> 00:00:48.375 align:middle
Oh, I'm always happy to help
with trash pickup. No problem!

00:00:48.458 --> 00:00:51.458 align:middle
[MARIE] Little does he know what
we're really doing tonight.

00:00:51.542 --> 00:00:53.958 align:middle
[MAYOR] What do you think
you're doing? Get out of here!

00:00:54.042 --> 00:00:56.667 align:middle
I didn't sign off on this!
You're trespassing!

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.542 align:middle
[CHROME] I may be wrong,
but that's the Holy Sword, yes?

00:00:59.625 --> 00:01:01.875 align:middle
The one that can only be
removed by powerful magic?

00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:05.583 align:middle
[MARIE] Yep. Legend says whoever
wields it shall rule the world.

00:01:05.667 --> 00:01:07.458 align:middle
Personally, I'm inclined
to call shenanigans

00:01:07.542 --> 00:01:09.958 align:middle
on that last little detail.
Methinks the mayor just likes

00:01:10.042 --> 00:01:12.583 align:middle
subsidizing his treasure
trove with tourist money.

00:01:12.667 --> 00:01:14.750 align:middle
[MAYOR]
You did not just do that!

00:01:14.833 --> 00:01:15.583 align:middle
[MARIE]
Whoops...

00:01:15.667 --> 00:01:17.958 align:middle
[CHROME]
Uh-huh.

00:01:18.042 --> 00:01:20.417 align:middle
[MAYOR] There goes the
Holy Sword campground!

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.292 align:middle
The museum! The Holy Sword
Four Star Vacation Resort!

00:01:24.375 --> 00:01:26.833 align:middle
You think people flock to
this godforsaken backwater

00:01:26.917 --> 00:01:28.417 align:middle
for the foliage?

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.292 align:middle
Well, I'm satisfied.
We can go now!

00:01:31.375 --> 00:01:33.625 align:middle
What d'you think we should
do about the sword?

00:01:33.708 --> 00:01:36.708 align:middle
[MARIE] Mm... Probably get
the word out before Mr. Chamber

00:01:36.792 --> 00:01:39.708 align:middle
of Commerce over there
makes a cheap knock-off.

00:01:39.792 --> 00:01:42.167 align:middle
Good luck with that, by the way.
I'm counting on you.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:43.875 align:middle
Huh?

00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.583 align:middle
[RIHO sighs]

00:03:28.667 --> 00:03:31.833 align:middle
Talk about fun. I love training!

00:03:31.917 --> 00:03:33.417 align:middle
You're a natural, Sir Lloyd.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.042 align:middle
I'm not crazy about
hitting the books,

00:03:35.125 --> 00:03:37.125 align:middle
but at least we'll have a
chance to catch a break--

00:03:37.208 --> 00:03:39.042 align:middle
Attention!

00:03:39.125 --> 00:03:40.625 align:middle
[CHOLINE]
Today we toss the books!

00:03:40.708 --> 00:03:43.250 align:middle
In place of dry theory, we'll
be running practical exercises

00:03:43.333 --> 00:03:47.500 align:middle
to prepare us for the match
against Rokujou Sorcery Academy!

00:03:48.542 --> 00:03:50.375 align:middle
--Huh?
--What kind of match?

00:03:50.458 --> 00:03:52.333 align:middle
It's a contest of magical skill.

00:03:52.417 --> 00:03:55.583 align:middle
Azami's been on a losing streak
the past several years.

00:03:55.667 --> 00:03:59.750 align:middle
We will kick our rivals'
butts! That's an order!

00:03:59.833 --> 00:04:01.167 align:middle
All right, as you all know,

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.625 align:middle
there are three types
of magical technique.

00:04:03.708 --> 00:04:06.000 align:middle
First, we have word
magic, or "chanting."

00:04:06.083 --> 00:04:07.250 align:middle
Next, there are signs
and symbols,

00:04:07.333 --> 00:04:08.750 align:middle
also known as "sigils."

00:04:08.833 --> 00:04:11.333 align:middle
Third, "conduits,"
or magical items.

00:04:11.417 --> 00:04:13.333 align:middle
With each technique
come certain advantages

00:04:13.417 --> 00:04:16.583 align:middle
and drawbacks, so it's
best to be eclectic.

00:04:16.667 --> 00:04:18.167 align:middle
Are we ready?!

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:19.625 align:middle
[STUDENTS]
Yes.

00:04:19.708 --> 00:04:23.667 align:middle
[SELEN]
Burn to ash. Flame magic!

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:24.708 align:middle
[SELEN laughs]

00:04:24.792 --> 00:04:27.833 align:middle
[RIHO]
Burn to ash. Flame magic!

00:04:29.583 --> 00:04:31.125 align:middle
Huh. Okay, then.

00:04:31.208 --> 00:04:34.083 align:middle
Nicely done you two.
Show me what you got, Lloyd.

00:04:34.167 --> 00:04:38.125 align:middle
Yes, ma'am! Here I go.

00:04:38.208 --> 00:04:40.250 align:middle
Urn shoe bash, maim tragic!

00:04:40.333 --> 00:04:42.333 align:middle
--[CHOLINE, RIHO] Oh, no!
--[SELEN] So cute!

00:04:45.042 --> 00:04:49.583 align:middle
Ah! Aw, man,
I totally botched it!

00:04:49.667 --> 00:04:52.250 align:middle
[STUDENTS]
He thinks that was a fail?

00:04:57.792 --> 00:05:00.958 align:middle
Right-o, you'll compete
using wind magic.

00:05:01.042 --> 00:05:02.250 align:middle
Are you crazy?

00:05:02.333 --> 00:05:03.500 align:middle
We're not supposed to
compete to the death!

00:05:03.583 --> 00:05:06.667 align:middle
Oh, calm down!
He didn't kill me, did he?

00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:12.542 align:middle
[CHOLINE] Bad news, kid.
You won't be representing us.

00:05:15.333 --> 00:05:18.250 align:middle
Excuse me! Sorry to
trouble you, Colonel.

00:05:18.333 --> 00:05:20.042 align:middle
I'd be interested to
learn healing magic,

00:05:20.125 --> 00:05:22.083 align:middle
and I understand you're
an expert in the field?

00:05:22.167 --> 00:05:24.083 align:middle
And why do you want
to learn healing magic?

00:05:24.167 --> 00:05:26.208 align:middle
Well, because tending
to someone's injury brings you

00:05:26.292 --> 00:05:29.708 align:middle
closer to them! It can be
a very intimate experience!

00:05:29.792 --> 00:05:31.042 align:middle
[CHOLINE]
Huh...

00:05:31.125 --> 00:05:32.417 align:middle
[RIHO] Hey, don't go thinking
that kind of thing

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.208 align:middle
is a cinch to pin down.
You'd be surprised how many

00:05:35.292 --> 00:05:37.708 align:middle
would-be adepts get
frustrated and quit.

00:05:37.792 --> 00:05:39.792 align:middle
You have no idea
what can go wrong.

00:05:39.875 --> 00:05:42.042 align:middle
Accidentally seal a wound
with debris inside,

00:05:42.125 --> 00:05:43.708 align:middle
and we're talking
major infection.

00:05:43.792 --> 00:05:45.125 align:middle
You're right back
where you started,

00:05:45.208 --> 00:05:46.500 align:middle
if they don't lose a limb.

00:05:46.583 --> 00:05:48.625 align:middle
Wow, Riho. You really
know your stuff!

00:05:48.708 --> 00:05:50.292 align:middle
Uhh, only what I've heard.

00:05:50.375 --> 00:05:52.083 align:middle
[ALAN]
So it's hard, okay.

00:05:52.167 --> 00:05:54.333 align:middle
All the more reason
to start early.

00:05:54.417 --> 00:05:57.250 align:middle
Seems like good expertise
to have it, if you ask me.

00:05:57.333 --> 00:05:59.417 align:middle
Totally agree,
I wanna learn, too!

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:00.625 align:middle
[CHOLINE]
Hmph. Great!

00:06:00.708 --> 00:06:03.042 align:middle
I propose a healing
magic boot camp sesh!

00:06:03.125 --> 00:06:05.833 align:middle
We'll need someone with
an injury we can work on.

00:06:05.917 --> 00:06:07.125 align:middle
[ALAN]
Hm?

00:06:07.208 --> 00:06:09.042 align:middle
Oh, if we only knew where
to find the poor soul!

00:06:09.125 --> 00:06:10.333 align:middle
We'll just have to be vigilant.

00:06:10.417 --> 00:06:13.583 align:middle
[ALAN groans]
My thoughts exactly!

00:06:13.667 --> 00:06:15.333 align:middle
There's a larger lesson
to be learned here!

00:06:15.417 --> 00:06:17.583 align:middle
The price of every
victory is sacrifice!

00:06:17.667 --> 00:06:18.750 align:middle
I don't follow.

00:06:18.833 --> 00:06:20.917 align:middle
Oh, wait. No, that's
a different lesson.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.833 align:middle
Yeah, I meant the cure can
be worse than the ailment.

00:06:23.917 --> 00:06:27.250 align:middle
[ALAN]
Colonel!

00:06:35.167 --> 00:06:36.333 align:middle
[MARIE]
Hello!

00:06:36.417 --> 00:06:39.583 align:middle
[MENA] Sorry, we didn't
mean to frighten you.

00:06:39.667 --> 00:06:41.875 align:middle
Just doing a little
window shopping.

00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:45.750 align:middle
Oh, I-- Well, please,
do come in.

00:06:45.833 --> 00:06:47.583 align:middle
My name is Mena Quinone.

00:06:47.667 --> 00:06:49.917 align:middle
This is my sibling,
Phyllo Quinone.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.750 align:middle
[gasps] The Mercenary
Sisters of Rokujou.

00:06:52.833 --> 00:06:55.250 align:middle
Ding-ding! I'll never
get used to being

00:06:55.333 --> 00:06:58.625 align:middle
so well known.
We're still students!

00:06:58.708 --> 00:07:02.375 align:middle
[MARIE] And what brings you
ladies to my humble abode?

00:07:02.458 --> 00:07:04.042 align:middle
[MENA]
We're looking for her.

00:07:04.125 --> 00:07:05.208 align:middle
[gasps]

00:07:05.292 --> 00:07:08.667 align:middle
So, you are familiar.

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:09.875 align:middle
[PHYLLO gasps]

00:07:14.208 --> 00:07:16.708 align:middle
Hi! Sorry I'm late!

00:07:16.792 --> 00:07:17.792 align:middle
Uh?

00:07:22.125 --> 00:07:25.000 align:middle
Lloyd, no!

00:07:25.083 --> 00:07:26.958 align:middle
Hello.

00:07:27.042 --> 00:07:28.167 align:middle
Huh?

00:07:32.458 --> 00:07:34.333 align:middle
Ah-ha! That's what that was!

00:07:34.417 --> 00:07:35.250 align:middle
[PHYLLO]
Huh?

00:07:35.333 --> 00:07:36.458 align:middle
[LLOYD]
Sorry I got in the way!

00:07:36.542 --> 00:07:39.375 align:middle
You'd have caught it if
I wasn't such a klutz!

00:07:39.458 --> 00:07:41.708 align:middle
[MARIE]
You're lucky it was only him.

00:07:41.792 --> 00:07:43.167 align:middle
[MENA]
Huh?

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:44.667 align:middle
Oh, hey.

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:47.000 align:middle
That's a pretty cool picture
of Miss Riho you got there.

00:07:47.083 --> 00:07:48.292 align:middle
You know this person?

00:07:48.375 --> 00:07:50.625 align:middle
Yeah! Me and her go to
the military academy.

00:07:50.708 --> 00:07:53.292 align:middle
Uh, maybe don't be so--

00:07:53.375 --> 00:07:54.667 align:middle
[PHYLLO]
Accept me as your protégé.

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:56.000 align:middle
--[LLOYD] Huh?
--[MARIE] Eh?

00:07:56.083 --> 00:07:58.167 align:middle
I will cook your meals,
clean house,

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:00.458 align:middle
murder your foes,
whatever you require.

00:08:00.542 --> 00:08:02.542 align:middle
That's really nice of
you to offer and all,

00:08:02.625 --> 00:08:05.417 align:middle
but this is Miss Marie's
house, so, uh--

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.792 align:middle
My name is Phyllo
and I live here now.

00:08:07.875 --> 00:08:10.167 align:middle
--[MARIE] You do?
--Agreed? Good.

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:13.083 align:middle
[PHYLLO] Now then. I shall
scrub the master's back.

00:08:13.167 --> 00:08:14.667 align:middle
--Oh, gosh!
--Where is your bath?

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:16.792 align:middle
This is making me
very uncomfortable!

00:08:16.875 --> 00:08:18.333 align:middle
[MARIE]
Out!

00:08:18.417 --> 00:08:20.625 align:middle
Cleansing salt banish!

00:08:21.375 --> 00:08:22.625 align:middle
[MARIE grunting]

00:08:22.708 --> 00:08:24.750 align:middle
[LLOYD]
Ow.

00:08:24.833 --> 00:08:26.250 align:middle
[MARIE]
Sweetie, are you okay?

00:08:26.333 --> 00:08:29.542 align:middle
I think that girl
broke one of my ribs.

00:08:29.625 --> 00:08:31.875 align:middle
[MARIE]
She did?

00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.875 align:middle
Let's fix it so you're
not in any pain!

00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.458 align:middle
Ah, it's no big deal, really.

00:08:35.542 --> 00:08:38.833 align:middle
Ha. It'll heal on its own
in a couple of hours.

00:08:38.917 --> 00:08:40.375 align:middle
What?

00:08:40.458 --> 00:08:44.292 align:middle
I'm fine, I promise. 'Sides,
I gotta get started on dinner!

00:08:44.375 --> 00:08:46.250 align:middle
I've gotta get used to this,

00:08:46.333 --> 00:08:47.708 align:middle
especially if we're
living together

00:08:47.792 --> 00:08:49.125 align:middle
for who knows how long.

00:08:49.208 --> 00:08:52.625 align:middle
I mean, it could be
several months.

00:08:52.708 --> 00:08:55.375 align:middle
[MARIE]
Possibly forever!

00:08:55.458 --> 00:08:56.583 align:middle
Uh--

00:08:56.667 --> 00:08:58.792 align:middle
So I hear you and Lloyd
paid a little visit

00:08:58.875 --> 00:09:00.208 align:middle
to the Village of
the Holy Sword.

00:09:00.292 --> 00:09:01.792 align:middle
It was work-related.

00:09:01.875 --> 00:09:06.000 align:middle
Uh-huh, and I'm sure you and my
darling had fun all the same!

00:09:06.083 --> 00:09:08.042 align:middle
Yeah, we did.

00:09:08.125 --> 00:09:12.250 align:middle
I knew it! You were
on a date! Curses!

00:09:12.333 --> 00:09:14.125 align:middle
I didn't hear you
come in, chief.

00:09:14.208 --> 00:09:17.375 align:middle
How are things? Where--
Where's Miss Marie?

00:09:17.458 --> 00:09:22.750 align:middle
No idea. But what is that
heavenly smell from the kitchen?

00:09:26.667 --> 00:09:28.917 align:middle
[MARIE]
Who does the harpy think she is?

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.083 align:middle
Some little brat could have
ripped my wings off--

00:09:39.083 --> 00:09:42.125 align:middle
[gasping]

00:09:46.333 --> 00:09:48.250 align:middle
[MARIE]
Maybe I'll die!

00:09:49.417 --> 00:09:52.167 align:middle
[CHOLINE] Okay, let's get
this show on the road!

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:55.625 align:middle
[CHROME]
Hm? The match is soon.

00:09:55.708 --> 00:09:57.500 align:middle
I should think of a way
to reward these kids

00:09:57.583 --> 00:10:02.917 align:middle
for all their hard work.
Yes, of course!

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.625 align:middle
[RIHO] I'm curious. Why do you
want to win this so badly?

00:10:06.708 --> 00:10:09.667 align:middle
No reason, certainly not
because that absolute snake

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:12.125 align:middle
of a woman just became
Rokujou's headmaster.

00:10:12.208 --> 00:10:13.375 align:middle
And that would be...?

00:10:13.458 --> 00:10:16.750 align:middle
[ROL]
Depends on who's asking.

00:10:16.833 --> 00:10:17.792 align:middle
[CHOLINE]
Rol?

00:10:17.875 --> 00:10:19.292 align:middle
Mind your manners, Riho.

00:10:19.375 --> 00:10:20.833 align:middle
That's no way to
greet an old friend.

00:10:20.917 --> 00:10:22.708 align:middle
We've known each other too long.

00:10:22.792 --> 00:10:26.208 align:middle
You're not supposed to be here!
The match hasn't started!

00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:29.042 align:middle
I've been looking
everywhere for you, Riho.

00:10:29.125 --> 00:10:31.000 align:middle
I'm relieved that
you're all right.

00:10:31.083 --> 00:10:33.708 align:middle
I see the mithril arm
is holding up nicely.

00:10:33.792 --> 00:10:35.542 align:middle
[RIHO]
How dare you...

00:10:35.625 --> 00:10:38.042 align:middle
Is this someone we should
be concerned about?

00:10:38.125 --> 00:10:43.292 align:middle
[CHOLINE] Most definitely. Rol
Calcife, headmaster of Rokujou.

00:10:43.375 --> 00:10:45.667 align:middle
We used to be classmates
back in the day.

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:48.708 align:middle
Some people schmooze and
connive their way to the top.

00:10:48.792 --> 00:10:51.375 align:middle
She clawed.

00:10:51.458 --> 00:10:55.000 align:middle
It's about time to come
home, don't you think?

00:10:55.083 --> 00:10:57.083 align:middle
But then again,
perhaps you get off

00:10:57.167 --> 00:10:59.583 align:middle
on losing things you hold dear.

00:10:59.667 --> 00:11:02.083 align:middle
Don't threaten me! I'm not
going to be strong-armed.

00:11:02.167 --> 00:11:06.125 align:middle
A deliciously ironic figure
of speech in your case.

00:11:07.583 --> 00:11:09.083 align:middle
There's no rush, love.

00:11:09.167 --> 00:11:13.542 align:middle
I'm happy to wait for an answer
on the day of the match. Bye!

00:11:17.875 --> 00:11:21.292 align:middle
Same for me, Master.

00:11:21.375 --> 00:11:22.750 align:middle
[screams]

00:11:22.833 --> 00:11:24.125 align:middle
Who is this floozy?!

00:11:24.208 --> 00:11:26.958 align:middle
Let us be on our
way now, Phyllo.

00:11:28.792 --> 00:11:30.333 align:middle
I'm sure there's a
reasonable explanation

00:11:30.417 --> 00:11:32.458 align:middle
for that exchange
and I am here for it!

00:11:32.542 --> 00:11:35.208 align:middle
I have no clue what
her deal is, actually.

00:11:35.292 --> 00:11:38.583 align:middle
I think she wants to come
live with us or something?

00:11:38.667 --> 00:11:44.083 align:middle
[growling] Over my dead body!

00:11:53.042 --> 00:11:56.500 align:middle
[MARIE] Oh, wow! Every time
you cook, you outdo yourself!

00:11:56.583 --> 00:11:58.417 align:middle
Bravo, Lloyd!

00:12:00.375 --> 00:12:03.042 align:middle
Glad you're happy with it, miss.

00:12:03.125 --> 00:12:07.583 align:middle
[MARIE] Oh, god! He's thinking
about the other night!

00:12:07.667 --> 00:12:09.500 align:middle
Um, can I ask you something?

00:12:09.583 --> 00:12:10.958 align:middle
Why, yes, of course!

00:12:11.042 --> 00:12:14.208 align:middle
It's just, someone I know
needs cheering up.

00:12:14.292 --> 00:12:17.958 align:middle
Trouble is, I'm not really
sure how to go about it.

00:12:18.042 --> 00:12:22.167 align:middle
[MARIE] Is it me?
Do I need cheering up?

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:25.125 align:middle
Ah-hem. Are we
talking about a girl?

00:12:25.208 --> 00:12:26.375 align:middle
Yes.

00:12:26.458 --> 00:12:28.667 align:middle
[MARIE]
He's so sweet!

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:30.208 align:middle
Well, let's see, then.

00:12:30.292 --> 00:12:33.000 align:middle
Asking her out to tea might be
a good way to lift her spirits.

00:12:33.083 --> 00:12:34.875 align:middle
Huh, that sounds kind of nice.

00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:37.250 align:middle
[MARIE]
Doesn't it, though? Like a date!

00:12:37.333 --> 00:12:39.500 align:middle
Like a date?
Uh-oh. That's, uh--

00:12:39.583 --> 00:12:41.542 align:middle
I mean, girls don't want
to waste their time

00:12:41.625 --> 00:12:43.875 align:middle
going out with a
weakling like me, right?

00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:46.375 align:middle
I better come up
with a different plan.

00:12:46.458 --> 00:12:48.042 align:middle
Stop being so down on yourself!

00:12:48.125 --> 00:12:50.125 align:middle
Brute strength isn't
the end all be all.

00:12:50.208 --> 00:12:52.583 align:middle
We also like thoughtful,
and kind.

00:12:52.667 --> 00:12:54.000 align:middle
That's two out of three!

00:12:54.083 --> 00:12:56.792 align:middle
You really think so? Thank you
for putting it that way.

00:12:56.875 --> 00:12:58.000 align:middle
No prob.

00:12:58.083 --> 00:12:59.583 align:middle
Huh, that settles it, then.

00:12:59.667 --> 00:13:02.833 align:middle
Tomorrow I'm asking
Miss Riho out for tea!

00:13:05.375 --> 00:13:06.625 align:middle
What?

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:09.917 align:middle
[SELEN]
Snap out of it, Riho!

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.375 align:middle
This funk is distracting Sir
Lloyd from more important

00:13:12.458 --> 00:13:15.333 align:middle
things, like paying
attention to me!

00:13:16.833 --> 00:13:18.875 align:middle
[SELEN]
Lookie, lookie!

00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:21.500 align:middle
Isn't this just the most
undeniably adorable photo

00:13:21.583 --> 00:13:25.583 align:middle
of Sir Lloyd you ever laid eyes
on? Are you cheered up yet?

00:13:27.042 --> 00:13:29.167 align:middle
[ALAN] Now, now, you're
doin' it all wrong, Selen.

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:31.708 align:middle
The way to a person's heart
is to tell them a dirty joke--

00:13:31.792 --> 00:13:33.708 align:middle
[RIHO groans]

00:13:33.792 --> 00:13:35.792 align:middle
[ALAN] Should've waited till
my wounds were healed.

00:13:35.875 --> 00:13:37.333 align:middle
[LLOYD]
Miss Riho?

00:13:37.417 --> 00:13:40.250 align:middle
Could everyone stop treating me
like I need an ice cream cone?

00:13:40.333 --> 00:13:42.625 align:middle
Would you go out on
a date with me?

00:13:42.708 --> 00:13:45.250 align:middle
[SELEN screams]

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.083 align:middle
[LLOYD] If you...
hate donuts, it's fine.

00:13:52.167 --> 00:13:53.292 align:middle
It's not that.

00:13:53.375 --> 00:13:56.333 align:middle
Okay, then, well,
I'm a good listener.

00:13:56.417 --> 00:13:58.250 align:middle
Why don't you try
telling me what's wrong?

00:13:58.333 --> 00:13:59.708 align:middle
Wha--?

00:13:59.792 --> 00:14:02.458 align:middle
[LLOYD] I understand if it's
hard to talk about, but...

00:14:02.542 --> 00:14:04.083 align:middle
I'm just worried about you!

00:14:04.167 --> 00:14:07.375 align:middle
You haven't really been
yourself since the other day.

00:14:07.458 --> 00:14:09.458 align:middle
Lloyd, I--

00:14:10.542 --> 00:14:12.333 align:middle
Why did she agree to
go through with this?

00:14:12.417 --> 00:14:15.875 align:middle
The two of them have
such good chemistry!

00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:19.375 align:middle
[ALAN] That's the biggest roach
I've ever wait a minute!

00:14:19.458 --> 00:14:22.708 align:middle
[ALAN groaning]

00:14:22.792 --> 00:14:25.458 align:middle
[LLOYD]
I thought this might help.

00:14:25.542 --> 00:14:29.125 align:middle
Oh, that's why we're
sitting in a tearoom.

00:14:29.208 --> 00:14:30.875 align:middle
[RIHO sighs]
Fine, I'll spill.

00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:32.458 align:middle
Ha!

00:14:35.375 --> 00:14:38.792 align:middle
[RIHO] So, yeah.
I grew up in an orphanage.

00:14:38.875 --> 00:14:41.125 align:middle
That's where I met Rol.

00:14:41.208 --> 00:14:45.292 align:middle
She had a real knack
for magic. Still does.

00:14:45.375 --> 00:14:49.625 align:middle
Just about everything I know,
I picked up from her.

00:14:49.708 --> 00:14:52.292 align:middle
See, us orphans
take care of our own.

00:14:52.375 --> 00:14:56.042 align:middle
Problem was, missing an arm
meant I was a liability.

00:14:56.125 --> 00:15:00.417 align:middle
One day when Rol came home,
she had a present for me.

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:03.750 align:middle
A prosthetic arm
made of mithril.

00:15:06.042 --> 00:15:07.500 align:middle
[RIHO]
I was so excited.

00:15:07.583 --> 00:15:10.708 align:middle
Finally I could go out,
get a job, earn my keep,

00:15:10.792 --> 00:15:13.958 align:middle
maybe even work side-by-side
with my best friend!

00:15:14.042 --> 00:15:17.917 align:middle
But no. Instead I ran away.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.833 align:middle
[RIHO] Rol is a user.
She didn't give me this arm

00:15:20.917 --> 00:15:22.500 align:middle
out of the goodness
of her heart.

00:15:22.583 --> 00:15:24.125 align:middle
She wanted to
signal boost my magic

00:15:24.208 --> 00:15:26.250 align:middle
so I could extract
the Holy Sword.

00:15:26.333 --> 00:15:27.750 align:middle
But that--

00:15:27.833 --> 00:15:30.000 align:middle
Could kill a mere
mortal like me, yeah.

00:15:30.083 --> 00:15:32.792 align:middle
Did I mention mithril can't
be touched with bare hands?

00:15:32.875 --> 00:15:35.042 align:middle
[LLOYD]
So, that arm--

00:15:35.125 --> 00:15:37.042 align:middle
[RIHO] Is like a plant
with its roots in me,

00:15:37.125 --> 00:15:39.333 align:middle
slowly draining my magic.

00:15:39.417 --> 00:15:41.375 align:middle
And there's nothing you
can do to get it off?

00:15:41.458 --> 00:15:44.708 align:middle
[RIHO] Nothing. Why do you think
I've been running my whole life?

00:15:44.792 --> 00:15:47.042 align:middle
All those warrants for
my arrest are her doing.

00:15:47.125 --> 00:15:49.875 align:middle
Not one of them is
for an actual crime.

00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:52.583 align:middle
I used to look up to
her when I was kid.

00:15:52.667 --> 00:15:55.625 align:middle
She just saw me as
a means to an end.

00:15:55.708 --> 00:15:59.833 align:middle
Taught me a hard
lesson about trust.

00:15:59.917 --> 00:16:02.583 align:middle
Wait? Were you listening to me?
You can't touch it!

00:16:02.667 --> 00:16:03.500 align:middle
It's okay.

00:16:03.583 --> 00:16:04.708 align:middle
[gasps]

00:16:04.792 --> 00:16:06.625 align:middle
[LLOYD] I may just be
a low-ranking cadet

00:16:06.708 --> 00:16:09.625 align:middle
who squeaked into
the academy on pity,

00:16:09.708 --> 00:16:13.250 align:middle
but I swear to you that
one day I will be useful!

00:16:13.333 --> 00:16:16.167 align:middle
Trust me, please.

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:19.333 align:middle
You and me are friends.
I could never betray you.

00:16:19.417 --> 00:16:22.167 align:middle
L-Lloyd.

00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:23.125 align:middle
[SELEN grunts]

00:16:23.208 --> 00:16:25.500 align:middle
You have betrayed me!

00:16:25.583 --> 00:16:26.833 align:middle
How long have you been hovering?

00:16:26.917 --> 00:16:29.250 align:middle
Shame on you! I would think
I was owed the respect

00:16:29.333 --> 00:16:31.333 align:middle
of being told that
story much sooner!

00:16:31.417 --> 00:16:33.042 align:middle
Wait a second,
this is about me?

00:16:33.125 --> 00:16:35.167 align:middle
I too am the foil
of false allegations.

00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:37.125 align:middle
Our mutual hardships
are the mast upon which

00:16:37.208 --> 00:16:39.250 align:middle
we may hang the sail
of deeper friendship!

00:16:39.333 --> 00:16:41.292 align:middle
They say I'm a stalker,
of all things!

00:16:41.375 --> 00:16:42.667 align:middle
Kind of a different situation.

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:44.917 align:middle
Life at the academy
would be absolutely,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.625 align:middle
unspeakably dull
without a Riho at my side.

00:16:47.708 --> 00:16:48.667 align:middle
[RIHO gasps]

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:50.417 align:middle
Thus our foes shall
feel our wrath!

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:52.958 align:middle
May their mothers rue the very
day they conceived them!

00:16:53.042 --> 00:16:56.417 align:middle
Yeah! Just not the
mother part, maybe?

00:16:56.500 --> 00:17:00.542 align:middle
This is stupid, what on earth
has gotten into you guys?

00:17:00.625 --> 00:17:04.167 align:middle
Still... You only live once.

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:07.167 align:middle
[MENA]
Now then, which cadets

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:09.292 align:middle
will have the honor
of representing you?

00:17:09.375 --> 00:17:12.458 align:middle
The two you're
looking at right now.

00:17:12.542 --> 00:17:14.875 align:middle
Choose me, Master.
Teach me well.

00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:16.667 align:middle
I will gouge her eyes
out with a spoon!

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:19.625 align:middle
Actually, Lloyd won't
be participating.

00:17:19.708 --> 00:17:25.458 align:middle
[MICONA laughs] Colonel Choline
appears to have a dilemma!

00:17:25.542 --> 00:17:27.917 align:middle
[CHOLINE] Please tell me the
rest of you heard that, too.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.167 align:middle
[MICONA]
I'm up here!

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:32.250 align:middle
[gasping] Who are you?

00:17:32.333 --> 00:17:34.667 align:middle
[MICONA grunts]

00:17:38.792 --> 00:17:39.750 align:middle
Who am I?

00:17:39.833 --> 00:17:41.625 align:middle
Only the much-celebrated
Micona Zol,

00:17:41.708 --> 00:17:44.542 align:middle
head of the second-year class.
As if you didn't know.

00:17:44.625 --> 00:17:47.500 align:middle
Why are we letting
children participate?

00:17:47.583 --> 00:17:52.875 align:middle
I shall represent Azami.
Not this mewling boy!

00:17:52.958 --> 00:17:55.583 align:middle
Lloyd Belladonna.

00:17:55.667 --> 00:17:56.833 align:middle
[LLOYD]
U-Uh...

00:17:56.917 --> 00:17:58.958 align:middle
Prepare to be humbled as
you sit on the sidelines

00:17:59.042 --> 00:18:01.667 align:middle
and witness the skills
of your superior!

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:04.250 align:middle
I think putting you in sounds
like an excellent idea!

00:18:04.333 --> 00:18:06.042 align:middle
[RIHO, CHROME]
Hooray!

00:18:07.333 --> 00:18:10.875 align:middle
All right! Kicking off with
the practice match! And go!

00:18:10.958 --> 00:18:14.208 align:middle
[MICONA yells]

00:18:14.292 --> 00:18:15.708 align:middle
--That.
--Looks powerful.

00:18:15.792 --> 00:18:18.208 align:middle
[MICONA yelling]

00:18:18.292 --> 00:18:19.583 align:middle
[RIHO]
Is that a magic stone?

00:18:19.667 --> 00:18:21.500 align:middle
[SELEN]
She's using a conduit!

00:18:21.583 --> 00:18:24.750 align:middle
Magical items augment her
proficiency in close combat.

00:18:24.833 --> 00:18:26.042 align:middle
[CHOLINE]
They're about to start.

00:18:26.125 --> 00:18:29.750 align:middle
[MICONA yelling]

00:18:29.833 --> 00:18:31.833 align:middle
Flame!

00:18:31.917 --> 00:18:33.250 align:middle
Water.

00:18:36.875 --> 00:18:38.417 align:middle
[RIHO, SELEN]
That didn't take long.

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:39.458 align:middle
[ALL gasp]

00:18:39.542 --> 00:18:41.292 align:middle
I'm afraid I have to call it.

00:18:41.375 --> 00:18:46.000 align:middle
No. Wait. Please.
I can't be out.

00:18:46.083 --> 00:18:49.458 align:middle
[LLOYD] Are you hurt?
You need healing.

00:18:49.542 --> 00:18:53.583 align:middle
How dare you look down upon me?
Remember your place.

00:18:53.667 --> 00:18:57.083 align:middle
I will not be patronized
by a useless scrub!

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:16.333 align:middle
[gasps] Micona? Oh my goodness!

00:19:16.417 --> 00:19:19.958 align:middle
Let's just be glad you
weren't seriously hurt.

00:19:20.042 --> 00:19:22.542 align:middle
There we go.
You'll heal up fine.

00:19:22.625 --> 00:19:24.958 align:middle
[screams] I can't
thank you enough.

00:19:25.042 --> 00:19:26.625 align:middle
[MARIE] Where have you
been all this time?

00:19:26.708 --> 00:19:31.667 align:middle
I used to see you every day.
Must mean you've improved.

00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:32.750 align:middle
Yeah.

00:19:32.833 --> 00:19:34.583 align:middle
Can I make you some coffee?

00:19:34.667 --> 00:19:35.958 align:middle
[MICONA]
Please.

00:19:36.042 --> 00:19:37.500 align:middle
[MARIE laughs]

00:19:39.375 --> 00:19:40.958 align:middle
[MARIE]
Black coffee.

00:19:41.042 --> 00:19:42.500 align:middle
Some folks like cream and sugar,

00:19:42.583 --> 00:19:46.333 align:middle
but no frills for
the two of us, eh?

00:19:46.417 --> 00:19:49.917 align:middle
[sighs] How I've missed this.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.125 align:middle
Uh? Are you feeling all right?

00:19:52.208 --> 00:19:53.458 align:middle
Uh. Sure!

00:19:53.542 --> 00:19:56.583 align:middle
You seem unusually flushed.
Those red cheeks...

00:19:56.667 --> 00:19:59.125 align:middle
Sweetheart, are you coming
down with a fever?

00:19:59.208 --> 00:20:02.583 align:middle
[MICONA gasping]

00:20:02.667 --> 00:20:04.583 align:middle
Well, not as warm as you look.

00:20:04.667 --> 00:20:06.042 align:middle
[MICONA] For a fleeting
moment we drew breath

00:20:06.125 --> 00:20:07.500 align:middle
from the same volume of air!

00:20:07.583 --> 00:20:09.542 align:middle
This is the greatest
day of my life!

00:20:09.625 --> 00:20:11.625 align:middle
I'm home.
What a crazy afternoon!

00:20:11.708 --> 00:20:13.458 align:middle
Oh. Miss Micona.

00:20:13.542 --> 00:20:14.792 align:middle
You know each other?

00:20:14.875 --> 00:20:18.208 align:middle
Kinda. We met during
practice for the big match.

00:20:18.292 --> 00:20:21.375 align:middle
Right, that's coming up soon!
Sounds like it'll be exciting.

00:20:21.458 --> 00:20:22.750 align:middle
[LLOYD]
Sure does!

00:20:22.833 --> 00:20:24.083 align:middle
[MARIE] Anyway, don't let me
keep you from dinner!

00:20:24.167 --> 00:20:26.000 align:middle
[LLOYD] Yes, ma'am.
Shouldn't take too long.

00:20:26.083 --> 00:20:28.375 align:middle
[MARIE]
Thank heavens! I'm starving!

00:20:28.458 --> 00:20:29.875 align:middle
What's on the menu this evening?

00:20:29.958 --> 00:20:31.542 align:middle
[LLOYD] You'll see. I don't
want to spoil the surprise,

00:20:31.625 --> 00:20:33.042 align:middle
but I think you'll like it.

00:20:33.125 --> 00:20:35.000 align:middle
[MARIE]
Duh! I love everything you make!

00:20:35.083 --> 00:20:36.833 align:middle
Especially when
you use tomatoes.

00:20:36.917 --> 00:20:38.375 align:middle
Does tonight's
culinary masterpiece

00:20:38.458 --> 00:20:40.708 align:middle
involve tomatoes, perchance?

00:20:40.792 --> 00:20:43.208 align:middle
[LLOYD] Did you start drinking
a little early today?

00:20:43.292 --> 00:20:45.208 align:middle
[MARIE]
Yep!

00:20:51.167 --> 00:20:52.917 align:middle
[CHROME]
Welcome, competitors!

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.917 align:middle
Now begins the interschool
match between

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.583 align:middle
the cadets of Azami, and
Rokujou Sorcery Academy!

00:20:58.667 --> 00:21:01.625 align:middle
Have you made up your mind?

00:21:01.708 --> 00:21:03.875 align:middle
Not so long ago, I would
have forfeited my life

00:21:03.958 --> 00:21:05.292 align:middle
for that orphanage.

00:21:05.375 --> 00:21:08.042 align:middle
Bear that in mind when you
think about this arm, Rol.

00:21:08.125 --> 00:21:09.208 align:middle
[ROL]
Wise choice.

00:21:09.292 --> 00:21:10.292 align:middle
[RIHO grunts]

00:21:10.375 --> 00:21:11.500 align:middle
[RIHO]
For the friend I thought I knew,

00:21:11.583 --> 00:21:13.000 align:middle
I'd have done anything.

00:21:13.083 --> 00:21:15.667 align:middle
But greedy, backstabbing snakes
that shed their conscience

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:19.250 align:middle
and take advantage of people
get nothing from me!

00:21:19.333 --> 00:21:20.833 align:middle
[ROL]
Tread lightly, Riho.

00:21:20.917 --> 00:21:23.375 align:middle
You may be forfeiting
more than your life.

00:21:23.458 --> 00:21:25.833 align:middle
You wanna test my resolve,
go ahead. I swear,

00:21:25.917 --> 00:21:28.333 align:middle
I'll protect those children
with everything I've got!

00:21:28.417 --> 00:21:31.500 align:middle
[ROL] Heh! I am sincerely
going to enjoy seeing you

00:21:31.583 --> 00:21:32.750 align:middle
reduced you to a puddle.

00:21:32.833 --> 00:21:34.833 align:middle
Before we begin,
allow me to showcase

00:21:34.917 --> 00:21:36.125 align:middle
what goes to the winner.

00:21:36.208 --> 00:21:37.167 align:middle
[BOTH]
Hm?

00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:39.250 align:middle
The Holy Sword!
Recently extracted!

00:21:39.333 --> 00:21:43.167 align:middle
Included but not shown is
a generous cash prize.

00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:46.000 align:middle
[RIHO, ROL]
Are you kidding me?!

00:23:23.042 --> 00:23:27.833 align:middle
[MICONA] Oh, Miss Marie.
Why him of all people?

00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:33.042 align:middle
[MICONA cries]

00:23:33.125 --> 00:23:34.542 align:middle
[SHOMA]
Something wrong?

00:23:34.625 --> 00:23:37.375 align:middle
[MICONA]
Hm?

00:23:37.458 --> 00:23:42.583 align:middle
You know, this rain isn't
gonna let up anytime soon.

00:23:42.667 --> 00:23:45.458 align:middle
Might as well tell me
what's bothering you.

00:23:47.958 --> 00:23:50.625 align:middle
[SHOMA] If it's a long story,
so much the better,

00:23:50.708 --> 00:23:52.958 align:middle
and if you were worried about
someone overhearing,

00:23:53.042 --> 00:23:55.875 align:middle
I'd say the ambient
noise has you covered.

00:24:00.625 --> 00:24:04.917 align:middle
[MICONA] My love...
My love has been stolen.
