[footsteps]

00:00:40.957 --> 00:00:43.501 position:50% align:center
Well, he's alive.
Better than I expected.

00:00:43.585 --> 00:00:45.879 position:50% align:center
Huh. You think it
was the treants?

00:00:45.962 --> 00:00:48.340 position:50% align:center
Well, no visible wounds,
so probably.

00:00:48.423 --> 00:00:51.384 position:50% align:center
And here I was, hoping this
would be an easy assignment.

00:00:51.468 --> 00:00:52.886 position:50% align:center
Careful with the attitude.

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:54.554 position:50% align:center
You're right, I should be glad.

00:00:54.637 --> 00:00:57.182 position:50% align:center
After all, it's a royal mission,
and a royal mission

00:00:57.265 --> 00:01:01.227 position:50% align:center
is a terribly serious thing.
We can write off our expenses.

00:01:01.311 --> 00:01:02.729 position:50% align:center
[PHYLLO]
Mm.

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:05.982 position:50% align:center
[MENA] You know,
it just occurred to me.

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:11.571 position:50% align:center
A serious mission requires
serious food. You hungry?

00:01:11.654 --> 00:01:14.491 position:50% align:center
A steak sounds pretty serious.

00:01:14.574 --> 00:01:17.077 position:50% align:center
Red meat and I have
been too casual lately.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.788 position:50% align:center
[MENA] Aww, then I'd
say it's about time

00:01:19.871 --> 00:01:23.083 position:50% align:center
to bring your relationship
to the next level.

00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:25.335 position:50% align:center
After visiting the
infirmary, of course.

00:01:25.418 --> 00:01:27.003 position:50% align:center
[PHYLLO]
Mm.

00:03:07.437 --> 00:03:09.481 position:50% align:center
[RIHO]
Uhh, hey Lloyd...

00:03:09.564 --> 00:03:12.901 position:50% align:center
So, I, uh-- I mean,
our break starts tomorrow

00:03:12.984 --> 00:03:16.821 position:50% align:center
and I was wondering--wanna
catch a horse race, maybe?

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:21.368 position:50% align:center
[screams] Hi, Selen--

00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:23.578 position:50% align:center
Our first vacation, and I
have been called home,

00:03:23.661 --> 00:03:25.455 position:50% align:center
summoned like a chambermaid.

00:03:25.538 --> 00:03:28.333 position:50% align:center
My family insists I avail myself
of their unparalleled

00:03:28.416 --> 00:03:32.170 position:50% align:center
companionship. I must cancel
my plans with Sir Lloyd.

00:03:32.253 --> 00:03:35.715 position:50% align:center
My dream of hot springs
has been crushed!

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:39.928 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Ah! Unless I firebomb
our ancestral home!

00:03:40.011 --> 00:03:42.013 position:50% align:center
Then they'd have no choice
but to send me back!

00:03:42.097 --> 00:03:45.141 position:50% align:center
Strike what I said earlier,
hot springs are still a go!

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:48.853 position:50% align:center
Wow, I'm sincerely flattered,
but I kinda already got plans.

00:03:48.937 --> 00:03:51.606 position:50% align:center
You said you're flattered! Which
means you'll take a rain check!

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:52.982 position:50% align:center
Which means marriage.

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:54.984 position:50% align:center
Not to be a storm cloud,
but you might be

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:56.361 position:50% align:center
getting ahead of yourself there.

00:03:56.444 --> 00:03:57.821 position:50% align:center
Don't think I didn't
over hear you

00:03:57.904 --> 00:03:59.864 position:50% align:center
flagrantly proposition
Sir Lloyd for a date!

00:03:59.948 --> 00:04:02.367 position:50% align:center
What are your intentions
with the man of my destiny?

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.453 position:50% align:center
You're out of your mind.
It wasn't a date. Good grief.

00:04:05.537 --> 00:04:07.455 position:50% align:center
[ALAN]
Woe betide me!

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:09.165 position:50% align:center
Whatever shall I do?

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:12.836 position:50% align:center
Who would've dared imagine?
Dear-oh-dear!

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:14.587 position:50% align:center
Is something the matter,
Mr. Allan?

00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:17.340 position:50% align:center
I am a failure as your
apprentice. An embarrassment.

00:04:17.424 --> 00:04:20.844 position:50% align:center
It is my duty to stand by you
during vacation. And yet,

00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:24.180 position:50% align:center
I've been roped into a meeting
I simply can't get out of.

00:04:24.264 --> 00:04:26.016 position:50% align:center
Sounds like important business!

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:29.811 position:50% align:center
Indeed. It's an interview
for marriage.

00:04:29.894 --> 00:04:31.563 position:50% align:center
They asked for me, naturally.

00:04:31.646 --> 00:04:33.773 position:50% align:center
Our families have arranged
the whole affair.

00:04:33.857 --> 00:04:35.984 position:50% align:center
For all I know, my bride-to-be
is a gargoyle,

00:04:36.067 --> 00:04:38.945 position:50% align:center
but propriety demands
I give a fair hearing.

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:41.740 position:50% align:center
I presume her ladyship must
come from excellent stock.

00:04:41.823 --> 00:04:45.118 position:50% align:center
Mayhaps our talk will
develop into romance.

00:04:46.536 --> 00:04:48.121 position:50% align:center
[RIHO]
Hmph. That'll be the day.

00:04:48.204 --> 00:04:50.290 position:50% align:center
[SELEN]
Whoever she is, I pity her.

00:04:50.373 --> 00:04:53.335 position:50% align:center
Hey! I am a snack
and you know it!

00:04:54.336 --> 00:04:56.212 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD]
I'm home.

00:04:58.089 --> 00:05:00.008 position:50% align:center
Hey, chief, what's goin' on?

00:05:00.091 --> 00:05:02.969 position:50% align:center
Just having a pleasant
chat with Marie.

00:05:03.053 --> 00:05:07.599 position:50% align:center
We're discussing our
plans for the holiday.

00:05:07.682 --> 00:05:12.062 position:50% align:center
Uh? Oh, yeah, I forgot.
I'm going out of town for a job.

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:13.480 position:50% align:center
[MARIE, ALKA grunt]

00:05:13.563 --> 00:05:15.815 position:50% align:center
[MARIE] As in a job that's not
in Chrome's cafeteria?

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:18.568 position:50% align:center
That's right, except I guess
it's more of an assignment.

00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:21.446 position:50% align:center
He's sending me to work at
a big fancy resort hotel.

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:22.947 position:50% align:center
[MARIE]
For the whole vacation?

00:05:23.031 --> 00:05:25.033 position:50% align:center
They're short staffed.
The place needs me.

00:05:25.116 --> 00:05:26.618 position:50% align:center
Somebody's got to
help out in the kitchen

00:05:26.701 --> 00:05:28.495 position:50% align:center
and pick up the slack
with housekeeping.

00:05:28.578 --> 00:05:30.955 position:50% align:center
All well and good, but why
does it have to be you?

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:32.165 position:50% align:center
[MARIE]
If Chrome is so concerned,

00:05:32.248 --> 00:05:34.167 position:50% align:center
then why can't he do it himself?

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.337 position:50% align:center
Come on, helping folks
is what I do best.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.756 position:50% align:center
[MARIE, ALKA gasping]

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:41.841 position:50% align:center
Well-argued, darling.
Excellent point!

00:05:41.925 --> 00:05:44.094 position:50% align:center
I suppose the honorable
thing would be for me

00:05:44.177 --> 00:05:45.762 position:50% align:center
to accompany you
on this "assignment."

00:05:45.845 --> 00:05:47.764 position:50% align:center
A fancy resort hotel?

00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:51.226 position:50% align:center
I am overdue for
a luxury getaway.

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:53.978 position:50% align:center
Look, I'm sorry. I know you
mean well, that you're

00:05:54.062 --> 00:05:57.148 position:50% align:center
just worried about me,
but I wanna do this alone.

00:05:57.232 --> 00:05:59.776 position:50% align:center
[MARIE, ALKA scream]

00:05:59.859 --> 00:06:03.405 position:50% align:center
Everyone's so useful. I need to
learn what that feels like.

00:06:03.488 --> 00:06:08.827 position:50% align:center
And with you around, I'd have
too much of a safety net. Sorry.

00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:19.337 position:50% align:center
Ugh, any minute now.
I can't wait around all day.

00:06:21.715 --> 00:06:23.842 position:50% align:center
[COBA] Good lord!
That presence! I'm done for!

00:06:23.925 --> 00:06:25.844 position:50% align:center
Sorry I'm late, have you
been waiting long?

00:06:25.927 --> 00:06:28.179 position:50% align:center
[COBA screams]
And you are?

00:06:28.263 --> 00:06:29.764 position:50% align:center
Oh, I'm your new part time help.

00:06:29.848 --> 00:06:31.975 position:50% align:center
Mr. Chrome sent me
from his cafeteria.

00:06:32.058 --> 00:06:33.977 position:50% align:center
My name's Lloyd Belladonna!

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.687 position:50% align:center
[COBA]
Damn that lumbering oaf!

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:38.940 position:50% align:center
Why didn't he tell me
this child was a beast?

00:06:39.024 --> 00:06:41.317 position:50% align:center
[COBA] Yes, well, pleasure
to meet you, Lloyd.

00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:44.612 position:50% align:center
I am Coba Lamin, owner
of this fine establishment.

00:06:44.696 --> 00:06:46.031 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD]
Mr. Chrome tells me

00:06:46.114 --> 00:06:49.367 position:50% align:center
you were a soldier in the
royal army, just like him!

00:06:49.451 --> 00:06:52.203 position:50% align:center
Yes, I was a captain
of the Royal Guard.

00:06:52.287 --> 00:06:54.914 position:50% align:center
Wow! That sounds
super dangerous!

00:06:54.998 --> 00:06:59.502 position:50% align:center
Perhaps, but not half so arduous
as running a resort hotel.

00:06:59.586 --> 00:07:04.132 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD] I'll bet!
This place is gargantuan!

00:07:04.215 --> 00:07:05.383 position:50% align:center
[COBA] Don't I know it?

00:07:05.467 --> 00:07:07.093 position:50% align:center
We've become quite
the fashionable

00:07:07.177 --> 00:07:10.305 position:50% align:center
vacation spot as of late.
Which makes the odd goings on

00:07:10.388 --> 00:07:13.683 position:50% align:center
all the more, shall we say,
disquieting.

00:07:13.767 --> 00:07:16.561 position:50% align:center
Guests and staff members have
been discovered comatose,

00:07:16.644 --> 00:07:18.438 position:50% align:center
with no explanation as to why.

00:07:18.521 --> 00:07:20.023 position:50% align:center
That's really strange.

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:23.443 position:50% align:center
I'm just grateful the situation
hasn't resulted in a fatality.

00:07:23.526 --> 00:07:26.446 position:50% align:center
I put in a formal request for
help from the government.

00:07:26.529 --> 00:07:29.449 position:50% align:center
Heh. Chrome agreed to send
someone he thought could help.

00:07:29.532 --> 00:07:32.702 position:50% align:center
As a cadet, I won't turn a
blind eye to your troubles.

00:07:32.786 --> 00:07:35.789 position:50% align:center
Anything you need, I'm your man!

00:07:35.872 --> 00:07:37.749 position:50% align:center
I'd prefer for you
to start right away,

00:07:37.832 --> 00:07:39.876 position:50% align:center
so that's good to hear.

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:51.304 position:50% align:center
[COBA]
Kikyou! What are you doing?

00:07:51.388 --> 00:07:55.058 position:50% align:center
Hi there, boss! You're
looking stately today.

00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:58.144 position:50% align:center
And you my dear look like
a consummate slacker.

00:07:58.228 --> 00:07:59.062 position:50% align:center
Young Lloyd?

00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:00.438 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:08:00.522 --> 00:08:03.108 position:50% align:center
[COBA] This is your immediate
supervisor, Kikyou.

00:08:03.191 --> 00:08:05.402 position:50% align:center
You must be the new
part-timer they told me about.

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:07.112 position:50% align:center
Nice to meet'cha. Welcome!

00:08:07.195 --> 00:08:09.572 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD] My name is Lloyd.
I won't be around long,

00:08:09.656 --> 00:08:11.366 position:50% align:center
but I'm happy to be of service.

00:08:11.449 --> 00:08:13.868 position:50% align:center
[KIKYOU] Goodness, that's a
first-class attitude there.

00:08:13.952 --> 00:08:16.121 position:50% align:center
I'm counting on you
to show him the ropes.

00:08:16.204 --> 00:08:17.163 position:50% align:center
[KIKYOU]
Sure thing!

00:08:17.247 --> 00:08:18.748 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:08:18.832 --> 00:08:20.041 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD]
Uh?

00:08:20.125 --> 00:08:22.043 position:50% align:center
I assume you're
familiar with sweeping.

00:08:22.127 --> 00:08:23.878 position:50% align:center
You want me to clean
this entire room?

00:08:23.962 --> 00:08:25.714 position:50% align:center
We all gotta pull
our weight, kiddo.

00:08:25.797 --> 00:08:27.215 position:50% align:center
No free lunches here.

00:08:27.298 --> 00:08:29.217 position:50% align:center
Our clientele have
grown accustomed to

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.261 position:50% align:center
an absurdly high
standard of service.

00:08:31.344 --> 00:08:33.221 position:50% align:center
Unless we can each
function as team members,

00:08:33.304 --> 00:08:35.265 position:50% align:center
and as individuals,
everything goes to hell.

00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:36.850 position:50% align:center
Done! What's next?

00:08:36.933 --> 00:08:39.269 position:50% align:center
Ah, so you're some kind
of joker, I see?

00:08:39.352 --> 00:08:42.856 position:50% align:center
[KIKYOU gasping]

00:08:43.898 --> 00:08:46.401 position:50% align:center
Did I go too fast
and miss a spot?

00:08:46.484 --> 00:08:50.196 position:50% align:center
Oh! I forgot to clean the
skylights! I'm so sorry!

00:08:51.948 --> 00:08:53.867 position:50% align:center
How are you doing that?!

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:55.326 position:50% align:center
Sorry to bother you, Lloyd,

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:59.039 position:50% align:center
I realize that you must be
busy--good lord, that glare!

00:08:59.122 --> 00:09:01.875 position:50% align:center
Ha! Mr. Coba! I'm just
finishing up here.

00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:05.211 position:50% align:center
Ah, now that's impressive. Uh?

00:09:05.295 --> 00:09:08.506 position:50% align:center
Um, sir? What in the world's
the story with this kid?

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:10.216 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:09:11.343 --> 00:09:13.386 position:50% align:center
Classified information.

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:14.596 position:50% align:center
[KIKYOU]
Huh?

00:09:14.679 --> 00:09:16.431 position:50% align:center
Let's give you a real
challenge, shall we?

00:09:16.514 --> 00:09:19.267 position:50% align:center
Yes sir!

00:09:19.351 --> 00:09:23.355 position:50% align:center
Oh! You wear that
uniform like a pro!

00:09:23.438 --> 00:09:25.857 position:50% align:center
So, I'm the face of hospitality?

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:27.650 position:50% align:center
[COBA] One of our most
illustrious clients

00:09:27.734 --> 00:09:29.736 position:50% align:center
is arriving a day
ahead of schedule.

00:09:29.819 --> 00:09:31.863 position:50% align:center
You'll be his concierge.

00:09:31.946 --> 00:09:33.615 position:50% align:center
Is that a fancy word for grunt?

00:09:33.698 --> 00:09:36.826 position:50% align:center
The nobility are a notoriously
fickle lot, so be warned.

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:39.788 position:50% align:center
They daren't be left
unattended for a moment.

00:09:39.871 --> 00:09:43.291 position:50% align:center
No pressure, just indulge
his whims with a smile.

00:09:43.375 --> 00:09:45.669 position:50% align:center
Lord Threonine.
Your early arrival

00:09:45.752 --> 00:09:48.213 position:50% align:center
is both an honor and a joy.

00:09:48.296 --> 00:09:49.923 position:50% align:center
I presume your
business concluded

00:09:50.006 --> 00:09:51.966 position:50% align:center
with auspicious dispatch?

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:54.052 position:50% align:center
Such language. If I
didn't know better,

00:09:54.135 --> 00:09:55.595 position:50% align:center
I'd think you were
calling me a hassle.

00:09:55.679 --> 00:10:00.475 position:50% align:center
[COBA] I assure you nothing
could be further from the truth!

00:10:00.558 --> 00:10:02.352 position:50% align:center
You are an obsequious ass.

00:10:02.435 --> 00:10:05.438 position:50% align:center
I am more than equal to the task
of decanting my own wine.

00:10:05.522 --> 00:10:08.900 position:50% align:center
But of course, my lord.
I'm sure few can do it so well.

00:10:08.983 --> 00:10:12.070 position:50% align:center
[THREONINE] Ah, nothing like a
glass in view of the cypresses.

00:10:12.153 --> 00:10:14.781 position:50% align:center
Right you are, my lord!
And may I be so bold as to say

00:10:14.864 --> 00:10:17.659 position:50% align:center
your eye for the natural
landscape is unsurpassed.

00:10:17.742 --> 00:10:18.868 position:50% align:center
Leave me be!

00:10:18.952 --> 00:10:20.412 position:50% align:center
That was not an entry
to the conversation.

00:10:20.495 --> 00:10:23.373 position:50% align:center
Quite! I'll make myself
scarce as a scarecrow.

00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:25.709 position:50% align:center
No doubt his lordship
is aware the forest

00:10:25.792 --> 00:10:27.210 position:50% align:center
is soon to be designated as

00:10:27.293 --> 00:10:29.963 position:50% align:center
a national landmark
for all to enjoy.

00:10:30.046 --> 00:10:33.717 position:50% align:center
Yes, a tourist trap.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:34.968 position:50% align:center
What do you think, boy?

00:10:35.051 --> 00:10:37.012 position:50% align:center
Should these trees be
subjected to the public?

00:10:37.095 --> 00:10:41.683 position:50% align:center
Uh. Well, they're certainly
very beautiful.

00:10:41.766 --> 00:10:45.353 position:50% align:center
Of course, people do
take things for granted.

00:10:45.437 --> 00:10:46.688 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:10:46.771 --> 00:10:48.440 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD] And it's a shame
how much the trees

00:10:48.523 --> 00:10:51.109 position:50% align:center
would have to be pruned.
If you ask me,

00:10:51.192 --> 00:10:53.820 position:50% align:center
it's better when they're
allowed to grow free.

00:10:53.903 --> 00:10:56.197 position:50% align:center
Oh, you seem to know
your dendrology, son!

00:10:56.281 --> 00:10:58.241 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure what that
means, but I picked up

00:10:58.324 --> 00:11:00.535 position:50% align:center
a few things from the
lumberjacks back home.

00:11:00.618 --> 00:11:03.038 position:50% align:center
[THREONINE] Yes, well,
I'm sure they engrained

00:11:03.121 --> 00:11:05.498 position:50% align:center
how unforgiving
forestry can be.

00:11:05.582 --> 00:11:07.625 position:50% align:center
My ancestors were
woodsmen, you see,

00:11:07.709 --> 00:11:09.669 position:50% align:center
before distinguishing
themselves in battle.

00:11:09.753 --> 00:11:11.463 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD]
You don't say!

00:11:11.546 --> 00:11:13.840 position:50% align:center
[COBA]
He's taken a liking to the boy!

00:11:13.923 --> 00:11:17.469 position:50% align:center
I forever lament mankind's
inability to let natural beauty

00:11:17.552 --> 00:11:20.472 position:50% align:center
speak for itself. To warp
a landscape for the sake

00:11:20.555 --> 00:11:24.017 position:50% align:center
of public accessibility
defeats its purpose.

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:27.562 position:50% align:center
That aside, it hinders
our investigation.

00:11:27.645 --> 00:11:28.813 position:50% align:center
[COBA]
I beg your pardon?

00:11:28.897 --> 00:11:30.774 position:50% align:center
You know, I have
an empty-headed,

00:11:30.857 --> 00:11:33.151 position:50% align:center
ne'er-do-well son
around your age.

00:11:33.234 --> 00:11:34.903 position:50% align:center
Damn fool's been
letting the attention

00:11:34.986 --> 00:11:37.697 position:50% align:center
he gets at school inflate
his sense of self-worth.

00:11:37.781 --> 00:11:40.283 position:50% align:center
Ha! It's refreshing to know
there are still young people

00:11:40.367 --> 00:11:42.285 position:50% align:center
in the world capable of
thinking about something

00:11:42.369 --> 00:11:43.953 position:50% align:center
other than themselves.

00:11:44.037 --> 00:11:47.290 position:50% align:center
Nature, for example!
Good show, my boy!

00:11:47.374 --> 00:11:49.376 position:50% align:center
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

00:11:51.127 --> 00:11:54.172 position:50% align:center
[KIKYOU] Pardon me. Nice
to see you, Mr. Threonine.

00:11:54.255 --> 00:11:56.966 position:50% align:center
[THREONINE] I understand
there's been another victim.

00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:59.844 position:50% align:center
Any other developments
to report?

00:11:59.928 --> 00:12:02.806 position:50% align:center
Nothing worth your time, really.

00:12:02.889 --> 00:12:05.684 position:50% align:center
To be expected, given
the owner's background.

00:12:05.767 --> 00:12:08.019 position:50% align:center
Military men play it
close to the vest.

00:12:08.103 --> 00:12:11.272 position:50% align:center
How can you be sure you're not
just being overly paranoid?

00:12:11.356 --> 00:12:14.609 position:50% align:center
Illegal treant cultivation seems
a bit of a stretch to me.

00:12:14.693 --> 00:12:16.653 position:50% align:center
The forest is close by.

00:12:16.736 --> 00:12:18.863 position:50% align:center
The hotel's proprietor
is a former soldier

00:12:18.947 --> 00:12:21.074 position:50% align:center
hailing from
war-mongering Azami.

00:12:21.157 --> 00:12:22.951 position:50% align:center
The victims have all
displayed symptoms

00:12:23.034 --> 00:12:25.286 position:50% align:center
consistent with treant attacks.

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:28.289 position:50% align:center
What you call paranoid,
I call astute.

00:12:28.373 --> 00:12:29.791 position:50% align:center
[KIKYOU]
Whatever you say.

00:12:29.874 --> 00:12:33.670 position:50% align:center
We'll investigate before the
area becomes a tourist trap.

00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:35.171 position:50% align:center
This region could be
on the verge

00:12:35.255 --> 00:12:37.549 position:50% align:center
of becoming a treant dungeon.

00:12:37.632 --> 00:12:40.635 position:50% align:center
By the way, I meant to ask you
why you got here so early.

00:12:40.719 --> 00:12:43.054 position:50% align:center
My intel was rather
time sensitive.

00:12:43.138 --> 00:12:46.599 position:50% align:center
A local lord wishes to marry
his daughter to my idiot son.

00:12:46.683 --> 00:12:49.019 position:50% align:center
I've come to take part
in the interview.

00:12:49.102 --> 00:12:50.437 position:50% align:center
He's a treant dealer.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:53.106 position:50% align:center
My sources tell me he's
amassed a small fortune.

00:12:53.189 --> 00:12:55.233 position:50% align:center
So he's the one
behind the attacks?

00:12:55.316 --> 00:12:57.027 position:50% align:center
The remains of a
vanquished treant

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:59.070 position:50% align:center
often make for
high-quality lumber.

00:12:59.154 --> 00:13:01.990 position:50% align:center
Selling it isn't illegal, but
the volume our friend trades in

00:13:02.073 --> 00:13:03.616 position:50% align:center
is rather suspicious.

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.619 position:50% align:center
There must be a connection
to this rash of comas.

00:13:06.703 --> 00:13:08.997 position:50% align:center
And you're baiting him
with an arranged marriage.

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:12.459 position:50% align:center
Sadly. I'm ashamed to dangle
my son in such a way,

00:13:12.542 --> 00:13:15.253 position:50% align:center
but it's necessary to
collect hard evidence.

00:13:15.337 --> 00:13:16.921 position:50% align:center
My hands are tied.

00:13:17.005 --> 00:13:19.883 position:50% align:center
A treant sapling known as
the Demon Lord's Seedling

00:13:19.966 --> 00:13:22.093 position:50% align:center
was recently pilfered
from our research lab.

00:13:22.177 --> 00:13:24.721 position:50% align:center
Imagine a demon lord
in this day and age.

00:13:24.804 --> 00:13:26.973 position:50% align:center
[THREONINE]
The thief's identity is unknown,

00:13:27.057 --> 00:13:29.559 position:50% align:center
but my sources tell me
that a traveling merchant

00:13:29.642 --> 00:13:32.187 position:50% align:center
was seen bringing
the sapling here.

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:34.481 position:50% align:center
[KIKYOU] Around the time
people started randomly

00:13:34.564 --> 00:13:36.274 position:50% align:center
falling into comas.

00:13:36.358 --> 00:13:40.278 position:50% align:center
Correct. Scholars agree the
sapling is parasitic in nature,

00:13:40.362 --> 00:13:42.155 position:50% align:center
using human beings
to disseminate.

00:13:42.238 --> 00:13:45.116 position:50% align:center
In turn, the host's powers
are greatly amplified.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.160 position:50% align:center
Speed and dexterity
in particular.

00:13:47.243 --> 00:13:51.164 position:50% align:center
[gasps] No way!
Could it be the new guy?

00:13:51.247 --> 00:13:53.041 position:50% align:center
I take it someone you
know fits the bill?

00:13:53.124 --> 00:13:55.835 position:50% align:center
Yeah. It might be
the new part-timer Coba

00:13:55.919 --> 00:13:57.921 position:50% align:center
just brought on this afternoon.

00:13:58.004 --> 00:14:00.006 position:50% align:center
[THREONINE]
I had a feeling.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.093 position:50% align:center
[THREONINE]
Use this on him.

00:14:03.176 --> 00:14:04.552 position:50% align:center
What is that?

00:14:04.636 --> 00:14:06.429 position:50% align:center
[THREONINE] An herbal
remedy that will relieve

00:14:06.513 --> 00:14:09.557 position:50% align:center
the poor lad from
playing unwitting host.

00:14:09.641 --> 00:14:14.521 position:50% align:center
Once ingested, it will expunge
the treant from his body.

00:14:14.604 --> 00:14:16.147 position:50% align:center
[KIKYOU]
Understood.

00:14:18.149 --> 00:14:20.235 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD]
All done.

00:14:22.153 --> 00:14:26.324 position:50% align:center
[KIKYOU] Well, that cinches it.
In no sense is that kid normal!

00:14:26.408 --> 00:14:29.035 position:50% align:center
Okay, play it cool.

00:14:29.119 --> 00:14:31.371 position:50% align:center
Nice work there, young
fella, you're a natural.

00:14:31.454 --> 00:14:33.039 position:50% align:center
How 'bout a cup of tea?

00:14:33.123 --> 00:14:34.374 position:50% align:center
Good evening, ma'am.

00:14:34.457 --> 00:14:36.626 position:50% align:center
I'm kinda surprised to
see you working this late.

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:38.211 position:50% align:center
[KIKYOU]
There've been a lot of people

00:14:38.294 --> 00:14:41.172 position:50% align:center
falling into torpor around here
lately. Gotta keep a lookout.

00:14:41.256 --> 00:14:44.676 position:50% align:center
The owner told me about that.
As a cadet, I feel it's my duty

00:14:44.759 --> 00:14:46.553 position:50% align:center
to help you uncover
what's going on!

00:14:46.636 --> 00:14:49.514 position:50% align:center
Wait, are you telling me
you're a soldier in training?

00:14:49.597 --> 00:14:50.849 position:50% align:center
Yes, ma'am!

00:14:50.932 --> 00:14:53.518 position:50% align:center
[KIKYOU] Tragic. They're
just using this poor kid.

00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:57.981 position:50% align:center
He's been hoodwinked into
the role of a treant host.

00:14:58.064 --> 00:14:59.774 position:50% align:center
[KIKYOU] Here, why don't you
drink your tea

00:14:59.858 --> 00:15:00.859 position:50% align:center
before it gets cold?

00:15:00.942 --> 00:15:04.487 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Miss Kikyou,
I appreciate it!

00:15:04.571 --> 00:15:08.616 position:50% align:center
[KIKYOU] Atta boy, down the
hatch. Let's see that sapling.

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:11.286 position:50% align:center
I've turned this place
upside down looking for you!

00:15:11.369 --> 00:15:14.330 position:50% align:center
Kikyou, I mean. Not you, Lloyd.
In fact, get some sleep.

00:15:14.414 --> 00:15:21.046 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir. Thank you, and have
a pleasant evening, Mr. Coba.

00:15:21.129 --> 00:15:22.255 position:50% align:center
Uhh...

00:15:22.339 --> 00:15:24.591 position:50% align:center
[COBA] We're on high alert,
not high tea!

00:15:24.674 --> 00:15:26.009 position:50% align:center
What, this? This isn't...

00:15:26.092 --> 00:15:28.011 position:50% align:center
[COBA]
One of these days.

00:15:28.094 --> 00:15:29.637 position:50% align:center
[KIKYOU gasps]

00:15:29.721 --> 00:15:32.182 position:50% align:center
[coughs] Good lord!

00:15:32.265 --> 00:15:35.143 position:50% align:center
Oh, it tastes like the
bottom of a hiking boot!

00:15:35.226 --> 00:15:37.145 position:50% align:center
Trying to poison someone?

00:15:37.228 --> 00:15:40.023 position:50% align:center
[crash]

00:15:40.106 --> 00:15:43.026 position:50% align:center
No point sticking around
if my cover's been blown.

00:15:43.109 --> 00:15:46.196 position:50% align:center
[KIKYOU]
Time to duck out and regroup.

00:15:46.279 --> 00:15:49.491 position:50% align:center
[COBA]
You've lost your mind!

00:15:49.574 --> 00:15:52.660 position:50% align:center
Damn it all, I knew in my gut
she had something to do

00:15:52.744 --> 00:15:55.622 position:50% align:center
with this! She's in
cahoots with Threonine!

00:15:55.705 --> 00:16:00.126 position:50% align:center
I don't know precisely what's
going on, but I will find out!

00:16:03.296 --> 00:16:08.093 position:50% align:center
[RIHO] Whoa! That's what I
call a breathtaking view!

00:16:08.176 --> 00:16:10.845 position:50% align:center
The room ain't half bad, either.

00:16:10.929 --> 00:16:14.516 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'm definitely
entitled to spoil myself.

00:16:14.599 --> 00:16:18.978 position:50% align:center
Case in point, lookie, lookie!
An actual telephone!

00:16:19.062 --> 00:16:21.731 position:50% align:center
I'm totally ordering a massage.

00:16:21.815 --> 00:16:23.066 position:50% align:center
[MALE A]
Good morning. Front desk.

00:16:23.149 --> 00:16:27.028 position:50% align:center
Oh! Uh. I, uh--

00:16:27.112 --> 00:16:29.656 position:50% align:center
[EMPLOYEE D] Lloyd, would mind
taking care of this for me?

00:16:29.739 --> 00:16:31.533 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD]
You got it!

00:16:39.499 --> 00:16:42.502 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD] Hello, I believe
you requested a massage?

00:16:42.585 --> 00:16:44.796 position:50% align:center
[RIHO] Ah, excellent!
You're finally here!

00:16:44.879 --> 00:16:46.673 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Uh?

00:16:46.756 --> 00:16:49.092 position:50% align:center
So, when you told us
you had plans,

00:16:49.175 --> 00:16:51.219 position:50% align:center
you meant you were coming
here to work part time?

00:16:51.302 --> 00:16:54.305 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD] Yeah, funny!
I gotta admit, though,

00:16:54.389 --> 00:16:56.850 position:50% align:center
never thought I'd see you
in a luxury suite!

00:16:56.933 --> 00:16:58.727 position:50% align:center
Yeah, well, it's not
like that cash prize

00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:01.229 position:50% align:center
from the tournament was
gonna spend itself, right?

00:17:01.312 --> 00:17:04.357 position:50% align:center
So, you're a bellhop?
Must keep you on your toes.

00:17:04.441 --> 00:17:06.693 position:50% align:center
Is the job as glamorous
as it seems?

00:17:06.776 --> 00:17:09.988 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD] I'm really here
to help solve a mystery.

00:17:10.071 --> 00:17:11.573 position:50% align:center
In other words,
you're sticking your nose

00:17:11.656 --> 00:17:13.450 position:50% align:center
into someone else's mess.

00:17:13.533 --> 00:17:16.202 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD] People are in danger.
I have to do something.

00:17:16.286 --> 00:17:18.621 position:50% align:center
'Kay! Let's get started.

00:17:18.705 --> 00:17:19.706 position:50% align:center
On what?

00:17:19.789 --> 00:17:20.999 position:50% align:center
Your massage, remember?

00:17:21.082 --> 00:17:22.500 position:50% align:center
--[RIHO] Huh?
--[LLOYD] Huh?

00:17:22.584 --> 00:17:24.044 position:50% align:center
[RIHO]
Wha--?!

00:17:24.127 --> 00:17:27.547 position:50% align:center
[RIHO sighs]
Ugh. This feels amazing.

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:28.757 position:50% align:center
[RIHO]
Sorry! I can't!

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:31.384 position:50% align:center
This is too awkward!
I've changed my mind!

00:17:31.468 --> 00:17:32.635 position:50% align:center
We're alone in here!

00:17:32.719 --> 00:17:34.763 position:50% align:center
I can't just let you run
your paws all over me!

00:17:34.846 --> 00:17:35.972 position:50% align:center
I don't understand.

00:17:36.056 --> 00:17:37.599 position:50% align:center
Send in someone else!

00:17:37.682 --> 00:17:40.310 position:50% align:center
Uh? I promise I know
what I'm doing!

00:17:40.393 --> 00:17:44.522 position:50% align:center
I don't want you
to massage me!

00:17:47.942 --> 00:17:51.613 position:50% align:center
Sorry to be pushy. I guess
I'm not a very good masseuse.

00:17:51.696 --> 00:17:53.114 position:50% align:center
[RIHO] No, that has
nothing to do with it--

00:17:53.198 --> 00:17:53.948 position:50% align:center
[MAID A screams]

00:17:54.032 --> 00:17:55.533 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:18:02.832 --> 00:18:06.211 position:50% align:center
Father, please. Surely I'm
responsible enough to be given

00:18:06.294 --> 00:18:08.213 position:50% align:center
some indication of
where we're going?

00:18:08.296 --> 00:18:10.548 position:50% align:center
Don't take it personally, dear.

00:18:10.632 --> 00:18:14.678 position:50% align:center
No destination is as important
as our quality time together.

00:18:14.761 --> 00:18:17.263 position:50% align:center
[SELEN]
Ah. Indeed.

00:18:22.894 --> 00:18:25.188 position:50% align:center
It's an honor to have
you with us, sir.

00:18:25.271 --> 00:18:27.065 position:50% align:center
A fresh change of
clothes at once.

00:18:27.148 --> 00:18:29.943 position:50% align:center
Our pleasure, sir.

00:18:30.026 --> 00:18:32.070 position:50% align:center
[SELEN] I understand
the dress code is strict,

00:18:32.153 --> 00:18:34.656 position:50% align:center
but doesn't this seem
just a bit over the top?

00:18:34.739 --> 00:18:37.200 position:50% align:center
[BOTH] Best of luck with the
nuptial arrangements, princess!

00:18:37.283 --> 00:18:38.952 position:50% align:center
Did they just say "nuptial?"

00:18:39.035 --> 00:18:42.664 position:50% align:center
Come now.
He's a military man.

00:18:42.747 --> 00:18:45.375 position:50% align:center
[SELEN grunts]

00:18:45.458 --> 00:18:48.795 position:50% align:center
[SELEN] If you'll excuse me,
I'm feeling unwell.

00:18:48.878 --> 00:18:51.464 position:50% align:center
Ah! Please don't
ever do that again.

00:18:51.548 --> 00:18:52.674 position:50% align:center
You're attending.

00:18:52.757 --> 00:18:54.426 position:50% align:center
My doing so would
be an imposture.

00:18:54.509 --> 00:18:57.137 position:50% align:center
I'm already betrothed to
someone at the academy!

00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:59.222 position:50% align:center
The gentleman we're
interviewing this afternoon

00:18:59.305 --> 00:19:01.099 position:50% align:center
is an elite, and
quite photogenic.

00:19:01.182 --> 00:19:02.475 position:50% align:center
Oh, father! How could you?

00:19:02.559 --> 00:19:04.269 position:50% align:center
Of all the men in the world
to whom could entrust

00:19:04.352 --> 00:19:05.729 position:50% align:center
your precious
little girl's future,

00:19:05.812 --> 00:19:07.939 position:50% align:center
you choose a boorish,
self-important man-child?

00:19:08.023 --> 00:19:10.734 position:50% align:center
[ROBIN] He's the first of
many potential suitors.

00:19:10.817 --> 00:19:15.822 position:50% align:center
Collect yourself.
Think of this as a rehearsal.

00:19:15.905 --> 00:19:18.491 position:50% align:center
[SELEN] Of course he'd
have an ulterior motive.

00:19:18.575 --> 00:19:20.243 position:50% align:center
Why is he like this?

00:19:20.326 --> 00:19:25.165 position:50% align:center
What's become of the
father I once knew?

00:19:25.248 --> 00:19:27.834 position:50% align:center
Kindly forgive the
tardiness of my son.

00:19:27.917 --> 00:19:31.087 position:50% align:center
It would appear his wardrobe
is rather complicated.

00:19:31.171 --> 00:19:33.840 position:50% align:center
[SELEN] I must prove that my
love for Sir Lloyd is pure.

00:19:33.923 --> 00:19:37.093 position:50% align:center
Where the hell are those
firebombs I ordered?

00:19:37.177 --> 00:19:39.220 position:50% align:center
The very idea of
being wedded to Allan

00:19:39.304 --> 00:19:41.139 position:50% align:center
is a blight on everything good!

00:19:41.222 --> 00:19:44.476 position:50% align:center
Should I kill him?
I should kill him.

00:19:44.559 --> 00:19:47.145 position:50% align:center
My belt can catapult me
to the door as he enters.

00:19:47.228 --> 00:19:51.483 position:50% align:center
I can run him through
the heart with cutlery!

00:19:51.566 --> 00:19:54.694 position:50% align:center
I believe he's
seen fit to join us.

00:19:54.778 --> 00:19:56.780 position:50% align:center
[SELEN]
True love must prevail.

00:19:56.863 --> 00:20:00.450 position:50% align:center
If blood must be spilled,
so be it! Sir Lloyd!

00:20:00.533 --> 00:20:02.827 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD]
So sorry I'm late!

00:20:07.374 --> 00:20:09.834 position:50% align:center
There is a god after all!

00:20:09.918 --> 00:20:12.170 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD]
Miss Selen?

00:20:12.253 --> 00:20:13.672 position:50% align:center
What on earth?

00:20:13.755 --> 00:20:16.132 position:50% align:center
She cleared that distance
like a professional.

00:20:16.216 --> 00:20:17.550 position:50% align:center
If you'll excuse me,
this young man

00:20:17.634 --> 00:20:21.930 position:50% align:center
and I have a date
with destiny! Bye!

00:20:22.013 --> 00:20:23.723 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Uh...

00:20:23.807 --> 00:20:26.059 position:50% align:center
Well, uh, given this
turn of events,

00:20:26.142 --> 00:20:29.354 position:50% align:center
you and I have much to discuss.
Would you not agree?

00:20:29.437 --> 00:20:33.942 position:50% align:center
Yes. There are a few details
to clear up, I think.

00:20:34.025 --> 00:20:36.569 position:50% align:center
[SELEN panting]

00:20:36.653 --> 00:20:38.571 position:50% align:center
Are you okay?
You seem out of breath.

00:20:38.655 --> 00:20:40.073 position:50% align:center
Because I'm overcome!

00:20:40.156 --> 00:20:42.742 position:50% align:center
The universe has heard my
request and given me an answer!

00:20:42.826 --> 00:20:45.745 position:50% align:center
Let's give this linen closet
a run for its money! Hey!

00:20:45.829 --> 00:20:47.080 position:50% align:center
[RIHO]
Whoa up, girl.

00:20:47.163 --> 00:20:50.667 position:50% align:center
The staff has enough to do,
thank you very much.

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:53.169 position:50% align:center
Miss Riho? What are you
even doing here?

00:20:53.253 --> 00:20:55.046 position:50% align:center
[RIHO]
That's the question you ask?

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:57.674 position:50% align:center
Not why Lloyd showed
up instead of Allan?

00:20:57.757 --> 00:21:00.343 position:50% align:center
Think maybe you're
a little bit fixated?

00:21:00.427 --> 00:21:01.761 position:50% align:center
I just assumed
Lloyd's appearance

00:21:01.845 --> 00:21:04.139 position:50% align:center
was a gift from the heavens!

00:21:04.222 --> 00:21:06.266 position:50% align:center
A lot's been going on.

00:21:06.349 --> 00:21:08.309 position:50% align:center
[MAID A screams]

00:21:08.393 --> 00:21:11.896 position:50% align:center
[THREONINE] Allan! What are you
doing? Snap out of it!

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:15.025 position:50% align:center
[COBA] Quickly!
Take him to the infirmary!

00:21:15.108 --> 00:21:16.526 position:50% align:center
What is it, what's going on?

00:21:16.609 --> 00:21:18.903 position:50% align:center
I just came in to clean
the room as I always do.

00:21:18.987 --> 00:21:21.614 position:50% align:center
The young master was unconscious
in the outdoor bath!

00:21:21.698 --> 00:21:25.326 position:50% align:center
Wait, is that...?

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:26.494 position:50% align:center
Mr. Allan.

00:21:26.578 --> 00:21:28.538 position:50% align:center
[MINOKI]
Good heavens!

00:21:28.621 --> 00:21:32.250 position:50% align:center
Lord Threonine. How can I help?

00:21:32.334 --> 00:21:33.501 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD]
Are you okay?

00:21:33.585 --> 00:21:37.297 position:50% align:center
Uh. Lloyd.

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:39.758 position:50% align:center
Ah-ha!

00:21:39.841 --> 00:21:40.759 position:50% align:center
Long story short,

00:21:40.842 --> 00:21:42.260 position:50% align:center
the old guy took
a shine to Lloyd.

00:21:42.344 --> 00:21:44.804 position:50% align:center
He asked him to fill in for
Allan during your interview.

00:21:44.888 --> 00:21:46.848 position:50% align:center
Meanwhile, I got suckered
into filling in

00:21:46.931 --> 00:21:48.266 position:50% align:center
for Lloyd on grunt detail.

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:50.894 position:50% align:center
I can't get over how handsome
you look in that outfit.

00:21:50.977 --> 00:21:52.145 position:50% align:center
Are you even listening?

00:21:52.228 --> 00:21:54.022 position:50% align:center
I regret not seeing
you as a bellboy,

00:21:54.105 --> 00:21:55.940 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you were adorable!

00:21:56.024 --> 00:21:57.859 position:50% align:center
You're focusing on
the wrong thing!

00:21:57.942 --> 00:22:00.487 position:50% align:center
As a hotel employee,
I have to help them.

00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:02.864 position:50% align:center
It's my job to get to
the bottom of this.

00:22:02.947 --> 00:22:05.450 position:50% align:center
In that case, I have
an exceptional idea!

00:22:05.533 --> 00:22:07.869 position:50% align:center
You're standing in for
my prospective fiancé.

00:22:07.952 --> 00:22:09.621 position:50% align:center
Very well. So, how about we use

00:22:09.704 --> 00:22:12.082 position:50% align:center
our courtship as a pretext
for investigating!

00:22:12.165 --> 00:22:14.959 position:50% align:center
That's not investigating, you're
just asking him out on a date!

00:22:15.043 --> 00:22:17.587 position:50% align:center
The culprit is likely
to make another move.

00:22:17.671 --> 00:22:19.964 position:50% align:center
We can tour this resort in
the guise of getting to know

00:22:20.048 --> 00:22:22.175 position:50% align:center
one another, and Riho
can snoop around

00:22:22.258 --> 00:22:23.426 position:50% align:center
while playing a cleaning lady!

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:24.928 position:50% align:center
Why does it feel
like I'm getting

00:22:25.011 --> 00:22:27.013 position:50% align:center
the raw end of this deal?

00:22:27.097 --> 00:22:28.932 position:50% align:center
That's not a bad idea.

00:22:29.015 --> 00:22:31.726 position:50% align:center
In fact, it's an excellent
way to avoid suspicion!

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:33.895 position:50% align:center
[SELEN]
I did good?

00:22:33.978 --> 00:22:36.064 position:50% align:center
This is nuts.
