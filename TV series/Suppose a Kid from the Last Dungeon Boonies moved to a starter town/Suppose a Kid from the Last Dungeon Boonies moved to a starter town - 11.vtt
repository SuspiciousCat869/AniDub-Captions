00:00:36.494 --> 00:00:40.749 position:50% align:center
[yawns] What could
possibly be so important

00:00:40.832 --> 00:00:42.751 position:50% align:center
that I had to wake up
at the crack of dawn?

00:00:42.834 --> 00:00:44.502 position:50% align:center
[VRITRA]
Resurrecting my body, you imp!

00:00:44.586 --> 00:00:46.379 position:50% align:center
My current form is too unstable!

00:00:46.463 --> 00:00:49.215 position:50% align:center
I could dissolve to nothing
at a moment's notice!

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:52.552 position:50% align:center
If that happens, you--yes, you--
lose control of your powers!

00:00:52.635 --> 00:00:55.472 position:50% align:center
Worst-case scenario, the
Last Dungeon will be unlocked!

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:57.265 position:50% align:center
Oh. Right. I forgot.

00:00:57.349 --> 00:00:58.433 position:50% align:center
[VRITRA]
Rage!

00:00:58.516 --> 00:01:00.852 position:50% align:center
Why are you like this?
You don't listen!

00:01:00.935 --> 00:01:02.437 position:50% align:center
If you do listen,
you don't remember.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.230 position:50% align:center
If you remember, you don't care.

00:01:04.314 --> 00:01:05.982 position:50% align:center
You are the pinnacle
of narcissism!

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:07.067 position:50% align:center
Excuse me, but--

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.111 position:50% align:center
[VRITRA]
I am not done chastising you!

00:01:10.195 --> 00:01:12.489 position:50% align:center
Isn't that right, Lloyd?

00:01:13.823 --> 00:01:15.033 position:50% align:center
[ALKA]
Uh?

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:17.911 position:50% align:center
--Huh?
--Uh...

00:01:19.037 --> 00:01:22.165 position:50% align:center
Heh. 'S goin' on here?
Something happen?

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:23.875 position:50% align:center
--[RIHO] No! Why do you ask?
--I didn't see anyone naked!

00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:25.126 position:50% align:center
Last night was just
like any other night!

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.670 position:50% align:center
[ALKA]
Not a persuasive answer.

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:29.589 position:50% align:center
[VRITRA] Could we stay focused
on my resurrection, please?

00:01:31.675 --> 00:01:33.218 position:50% align:center
There she is.

00:01:33.301 --> 00:01:36.054 position:50% align:center
Feast your eyes,
ladies n' germs.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.724 position:50% align:center
[EUG]
The Last Dungeon.

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:17.614 position:50% align:center
[SELEN]
This is a dungeon?

00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:20.450 position:50% align:center
[ALKA] We call it "the prison
at the end of the world."

00:03:20.533 --> 00:03:22.452 position:50% align:center
Or "The Last Dungeon."

00:03:22.535 --> 00:03:25.538 position:50% align:center
It's not like any prison
I've ever seen.

00:03:25.622 --> 00:03:26.998 position:50% align:center
What a fabulous name!

00:03:27.082 --> 00:03:29.793 position:50% align:center
There must be mountains of
treasure behind those walls!

00:03:29.876 --> 00:03:31.795 position:50% align:center
[ALKA] The only thing you'll
find behind those walls

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:33.088 position:50% align:center
are demon lords.

00:03:33.171 --> 00:03:36.591 position:50% align:center
[RIHO grunts]

00:03:36.675 --> 00:03:38.176 position:50% align:center
[EUG]
Don't let the name fool you.

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:40.762 position:50% align:center
This ain't the standard "slay
the monster, yoink the loot"

00:03:40.845 --> 00:03:43.682 position:50% align:center
hoosegow you probably
have in mind.

00:03:43.765 --> 00:03:46.851 position:50% align:center
In fact, the sorta dungeons
you're used to are all decoys,

00:03:46.935 --> 00:03:49.396 position:50% align:center
cleverly built by us dwarves
to keep The Last Dungeon

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:51.523 position:50% align:center
from slipping into
public knowledge.

00:03:51.606 --> 00:03:54.776 position:50% align:center
Man, this stuff would never
get published in a textbook.

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:57.278 position:50% align:center
You'd have to convince
people Kunlun existed,

00:03:57.362 --> 00:04:00.615 position:50% align:center
or for that matter,
that dwarves are real.

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:03.159 position:50% align:center
[ALKA] The residents of Kunlun
keep watch over this place

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:06.079 position:50% align:center
and subdue the demon lords'
cunning enough to escape.

00:04:06.162 --> 00:04:07.997 position:50% align:center
I didn't know that. Wow.

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:09.916 position:50% align:center
Guess they don't really
let you in on these things

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.584 position:50% align:center
till you've beaten
your first monster.

00:04:11.668 --> 00:04:12.794 position:50% align:center
[PHYLLO, SELEN
chuckle nervously]

00:04:12.877 --> 00:04:14.879 position:50% align:center
[EUG] Vritra is the guardian
beast of Kunlun.

00:04:14.963 --> 00:04:16.840 position:50% align:center
Alka's lighting rod.

00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:19.718 position:50% align:center
Whatever damage she takes,
she can transfer to him.

00:04:19.801 --> 00:04:22.220 position:50% align:center
That's the secret behind her
ability to harness the power

00:04:22.303 --> 00:04:23.847 position:50% align:center
emanating from this place.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.348 position:50% align:center
Must be convenient.

00:04:25.432 --> 00:04:27.350 position:50% align:center
[RIHO] I understand what
all those words mean,

00:04:27.434 --> 00:04:28.977 position:50% align:center
just not together.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.770 position:50% align:center
Ah! Let me explain!

00:04:30.854 --> 00:04:32.355 position:50% align:center
The Last Dungeon is powerful,

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:35.191 position:50% align:center
so powerful that it shapes
the collective unconscious.

00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:36.651 position:50% align:center
Think of it as
the unacknowledged

00:04:36.735 --> 00:04:38.987 position:50% align:center
common denominator
behind your worldview.

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.822 position:50% align:center
Throw in a few ancient texts.

00:04:40.905 --> 00:04:45.035 position:50% align:center
some fairy tales, and then
you get Alka and the rest.

00:04:45.118 --> 00:04:46.661 position:50% align:center
Um. Okay, try this.

00:04:46.745 --> 00:04:48.830 position:50% align:center
Super magic powers,
crazy awesome runes,

00:04:48.913 --> 00:04:51.708 position:50% align:center
the whole shebang,
but on a global scale.

00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:54.627 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure what
"global scale" means.

00:04:55.754 --> 00:04:57.172 position:50% align:center
I'll tell you what, kids.

00:04:57.255 --> 00:04:59.674 position:50% align:center
Gimme a hundred years and
I'll spell out the fundamentals.

00:04:59.758 --> 00:05:01.134 position:50% align:center
Let's stick to what's relevant.

00:05:01.217 --> 00:05:03.303 position:50% align:center
Chief forgot all that
and flayed Vritra.

00:05:03.386 --> 00:05:06.014 position:50% align:center
If I had to guess, I'd say this
kind of thing happens frequently

00:05:06.097 --> 00:05:08.016 position:50% align:center
and that's why
we're in this mess.

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:10.769 position:50% align:center
For the record, I would never
have tried to take his skin off

00:05:10.852 --> 00:05:12.103 position:50% align:center
if Eug hadn't told me
it would make

00:05:12.187 --> 00:05:13.313 position:50% align:center
a great stain-resistant apron!

00:05:13.396 --> 00:05:14.314 position:50% align:center
Shifting blame.

00:05:14.397 --> 00:05:15.607 position:50% align:center
Damn right I am!

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.193 position:50% align:center
[EUG] The point is,
with Vritra in this state,

00:05:18.276 --> 00:05:21.237 position:50% align:center
Alka's power has run amok,
so badly that if, for example,

00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:23.448 position:50% align:center
we were to open The Last Dungeon
with our special key,

00:05:23.531 --> 00:05:26.451 position:50% align:center
the demon lords locked away
inside would come pouring out.

00:05:26.534 --> 00:05:27.494 position:50% align:center
[RIHO]
What key?

00:05:27.577 --> 00:05:28.453 position:50% align:center
The sword.

00:05:28.536 --> 00:05:29.371 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:05:29.454 --> 00:05:31.289 position:50% align:center
Oh, you mean that sword.

00:05:31.373 --> 00:05:33.833 position:50% align:center
Huh. Well, I learned something.

00:05:33.917 --> 00:05:36.002 position:50% align:center
[EUG] No clue how it got free,
or who snagged it,

00:05:36.086 --> 00:05:39.422 position:50% align:center
but what's done is done.
Any idea where it is?

00:05:39.506 --> 00:05:42.008 position:50% align:center
At the moment it's placed
in the castle treasury.

00:05:42.092 --> 00:05:45.845 position:50% align:center
Smart move. Just be sure
to keep it safe. Heh.

00:05:45.929 --> 00:05:47.013 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:05:47.097 --> 00:05:49.724 position:50% align:center
All right. Gimme Vritra.

00:05:52.894 --> 00:05:54.771 position:50% align:center
You were a loyal protector.

00:05:54.854 --> 00:05:58.316 position:50% align:center
Thank you, old friend.
Remember me fondly.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.859 position:50% align:center
[VRITRA]
My sweet child.

00:05:59.943 --> 00:06:02.487 position:50% align:center
Words fail to encapsulate
the depths of my grief

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:06.491 position:50% align:center
at having to leave
your side! Sad face!

00:06:06.574 --> 00:06:11.705 position:50% align:center
Cool! Let's fire up the ritual
of Vritra's resurrection!

00:06:16.001 --> 00:06:17.127 position:50% align:center
[RIHO]
Um...

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.629 position:50% align:center
[EUG] We start with boneless
ribs as a base.

00:06:19.713 --> 00:06:20.964 position:50% align:center
What are you doing?

00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:22.674 position:50% align:center
[EUG]
Vigorously tenderize.

00:06:22.757 --> 00:06:25.552 position:50% align:center
Wrap well to ensure the
meat holds its shape.

00:06:25.635 --> 00:06:26.803 position:50% align:center
[VRITRA]
Eh?

00:06:26.886 --> 00:06:29.639 position:50% align:center
[EUG] Sear with clarified butter
over medium heat

00:06:29.723 --> 00:06:33.351 position:50% align:center
until the outside is
a nice, golden brown.

00:06:33.435 --> 00:06:35.437 position:50% align:center
That looks good.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.022 position:50% align:center
[EUG]
Set meat aside.

00:06:37.105 --> 00:06:40.150 position:50% align:center
To a large pot, add soy sauce,
cooking sherry, ginger slices,

00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:41.860 position:50% align:center
and, of course, green onion.

00:06:41.943 --> 00:06:43.945 position:50% align:center
Let simmer a few minutes
on low before adding in

00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:46.156 position:50% align:center
my special sauce. Recipe
available upon request.

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:47.282 position:50% align:center
What the hell?

00:06:47.365 --> 00:06:49.159 position:50% align:center
That's not a ritual,
that's pork roast!

00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:50.452 position:50% align:center
Busted.

00:06:50.535 --> 00:06:52.662 position:50% align:center
Seriously, though,
the best part is coming up.

00:06:52.746 --> 00:06:53.997 position:50% align:center
Just bear with me!

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.124 position:50% align:center
[VRITRA] Hey! Some would
call this assault!

00:06:56.207 --> 00:06:58.835 position:50% align:center
Or, uh, just salt.

00:06:58.918 --> 00:07:01.629 position:50% align:center
[EUG]
Check it out. This is fun.

00:07:03.131 --> 00:07:04.716 position:50% align:center
[EUG]
Plonk! Bring to a boil,

00:07:04.799 --> 00:07:09.137 position:50% align:center
then reduce the heat and
let simmer for three hours.

00:07:14.851 --> 00:07:17.187 position:50% align:center
[EUG]
Bone apple tea.

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:20.023 position:50% align:center
Now what?

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:21.399 position:50% align:center
[EUG]
Hey, Alka.

00:07:21.483 --> 00:07:22.859 position:50% align:center
[ALKA]
Hm?

00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:26.654 position:50% align:center
What the--? Ow!

00:07:26.738 --> 00:07:28.698 position:50% align:center
I felt that! Holy crap!

00:07:28.782 --> 00:07:32.660 position:50% align:center
And once again, my genius
speaks for itself.

00:07:32.744 --> 00:07:36.247 position:50% align:center
Uh! You don't look so good,
Chief. What's wrong?

00:07:36.331 --> 00:07:39.501 position:50% align:center
[ALKA]
My body... It feels so weak.

00:07:39.584 --> 00:07:41.419 position:50% align:center
[EUG]
That's the intended effect.

00:07:41.503 --> 00:07:44.464 position:50% align:center
Means you've been cut off
from the Last Dungeon.

00:07:44.547 --> 00:07:46.841 position:50% align:center
That's a good thing! Alka's
meant to have the stamina

00:07:46.925 --> 00:07:50.345 position:50% align:center
of a child. It's her intellect
that's supposed to be so OP.

00:07:50.428 --> 00:07:52.972 position:50% align:center
And, either way,
she has no common sense.

00:07:53.056 --> 00:07:54.474 position:50% align:center
So I can call her a harpy?

00:07:54.557 --> 00:07:56.101 position:50% align:center
Or Madam Bad Touch.

00:07:56.184 --> 00:07:57.102 position:50% align:center
How about creep?

00:07:57.185 --> 00:07:58.103 position:50% align:center
Super skeez?

00:07:58.186 --> 00:07:59.729 position:50% align:center
Why you little...!

00:07:59.813 --> 00:08:01.106 position:50% align:center
Don't hold back!

00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:02.816 position:50% align:center
If you've got shade to throw,
this is your moment.

00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:04.734 position:50% align:center
Hell yeah! Bring it on!

00:08:04.818 --> 00:08:06.111 position:50% align:center
[ALKA growls]

00:08:08.071 --> 00:08:09.239 position:50% align:center
[MARIE whimpers]

00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:10.824 position:50% align:center
[ALKA roaring]

00:08:10.907 --> 00:08:13.368 position:50% align:center
[MARIE panting]
No...

00:08:13.451 --> 00:08:14.703 position:50% align:center
[RIHO]
Wuss.

00:08:15.704 --> 00:08:17.372 position:50% align:center
I think my work here is done.

00:08:17.455 --> 00:08:19.791 position:50% align:center
Isn't it about time for you guys
to be schlepping back?

00:08:19.874 --> 00:08:22.210 position:50% align:center
The exhibition match
is tomorrow.

00:08:22.293 --> 00:08:25.338 position:50% align:center
Right! We're supposed to go
and cheer on Mr. Alan!

00:08:25.422 --> 00:08:27.215 position:50% align:center
That, and there's
much work to do.

00:08:27.298 --> 00:08:30.051 position:50% align:center
The Stadium must be
decked out to the nines.

00:08:30.135 --> 00:08:32.262 position:50% align:center
Mind if I watch from
the stands as I wait?

00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:33.847 position:50% align:center
Vritra'll be a while.

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:35.432 position:50% align:center
[ALKA] Since when have you
been interested

00:08:35.515 --> 00:08:37.809 position:50% align:center
in lowbrow contests of skill?

00:08:37.892 --> 00:08:39.728 position:50% align:center
What? I can be well-rounded.

00:08:39.811 --> 00:08:41.730 position:50% align:center
[CHROME]
Well then, let's push off!

00:08:41.813 --> 00:08:43.189 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD]
Go on ahead.

00:08:43.273 --> 00:08:45.775 position:50% align:center
I'll pop by the village and
say bye to everyone first.

00:08:45.859 --> 00:08:47.360 position:50% align:center
[EUG]
Alka.

00:08:47.444 --> 00:08:50.447 position:50% align:center
If you wouldn't mind giving me
just a few minutes of your time.

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:54.075 position:50% align:center
There are a few details we
need to iron out in private.

00:08:59.289 --> 00:09:02.083 position:50% align:center
Whatever it is, if we can do
it quickly, that'd be great.

00:09:02.167 --> 00:09:03.710 position:50% align:center
The sooner I play up
my weakness,

00:09:03.793 --> 00:09:05.712 position:50% align:center
the sooner Lloyd will pity me!

00:09:05.795 --> 00:09:08.006 position:50% align:center
[EUG] In my defense,
you were a glass cannon

00:09:08.089 --> 00:09:13.261 position:50% align:center
long before I turned
you squishy. Fact.

00:09:13.345 --> 00:09:16.306 position:50% align:center
It's why we've
never been friends.

00:09:17.349 --> 00:09:20.602 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Eug.

00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:31.488 position:50% align:center
Is this your idea of a joke?

00:09:31.571 --> 00:09:34.824 position:50% align:center
Because if so,
this is a bridge too far!

00:09:34.908 --> 00:09:36.576 position:50% align:center
Do you hear me laughing?

00:09:36.659 --> 00:09:38.828 position:50% align:center
This is more a
declaration of war.

00:09:38.912 --> 00:09:40.246 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:41.915 position:50% align:center
[EUG] Once I knew the
whereabouts of the Holy Sword,

00:09:41.998 --> 00:09:44.668 position:50% align:center
diminishing your power for a
day or two was the only thing

00:09:44.751 --> 00:09:48.046 position:50% align:center
standing between me and
releasing the demon lords.

00:09:48.129 --> 00:09:50.048 position:50% align:center
[ALKA] You didn't resurrect
Vritra at all!

00:09:50.131 --> 00:09:51.424 position:50% align:center
You sealed him up!

00:09:51.508 --> 00:09:52.926 position:50% align:center
[EUG]
Bingo.

00:09:53.009 --> 00:09:56.429 position:50% align:center
Not much of a chore after
you've handled a few baddies.

00:09:56.513 --> 00:09:58.765 position:50% align:center
[ALKA] So what exactly
is your endgame?

00:09:58.848 --> 00:10:02.268 position:50% align:center
To give this world the reboot
it so desperately needs!

00:10:02.352 --> 00:10:05.980 position:50% align:center
And don't worry.
I've thought of every detail.

00:10:06.064 --> 00:10:08.066 position:50% align:center
My new hero
really fits the bill.

00:10:08.149 --> 00:10:11.069 position:50% align:center
You fiend...
You can't mean Shoma?

00:10:11.152 --> 00:10:13.697 position:50% align:center
Did I go and spoil the reveal?

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:16.032 position:50% align:center
Maybe by the time you get out
of here, you'll have forgotten.

00:10:16.116 --> 00:10:19.994 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Eug! Don't do this!

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:22.747 position:50% align:center
[MARIE]
Uh?

00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:27.919 position:50% align:center
Unusual as this place is,
I'm already starting to miss it.

00:10:28.003 --> 00:10:30.380 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I feel that same way.

00:10:30.463 --> 00:10:31.631 position:50% align:center
Glad we're going home, though.

00:10:31.715 --> 00:10:34.134 position:50% align:center
Too much longer and we'd
have lost our minds.

00:10:34.217 --> 00:10:36.553 position:50% align:center
[SELEN] I will grow accustomed
to life among these people,

00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:37.637 position:50% align:center
as Sir Lloyd's wife.

00:10:37.721 --> 00:10:39.389 position:50% align:center
[PHYLLO]
When I marry the master,

00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:41.558 position:50% align:center
I'll grow accustomed
to being a legend.

00:10:41.641 --> 00:10:43.268 position:50% align:center
[RIHO]
I rest my case.

00:10:43.351 --> 00:10:45.311 position:50% align:center
Okay, campers. You ready?

00:10:45.395 --> 00:10:47.313 position:50% align:center
[MARIE]
Wait. Where's the chief?

00:10:47.397 --> 00:10:49.899 position:50% align:center
[EUG] Figured she'd have joined
up with you all by now.

00:10:49.983 --> 00:10:52.944 position:50% align:center
Or, you know, on second thought,
maybe she's plotting.

00:10:53.028 --> 00:10:55.697 position:50% align:center
Think she'd be mad enough to
kill over what you said earlier?

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:58.742 position:50% align:center
[MARIE grunts]
Come! We must return to Azami!

00:10:58.825 --> 00:10:59.868 position:50% align:center
[screaming]

00:10:59.951 --> 00:11:00.785 position:50% align:center
Miss Marie!

00:11:00.869 --> 00:11:02.871 position:50% align:center
[CHOLINE]
Uh, I mean, okay.

00:11:02.954 --> 00:11:05.040 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'd scram if I were you.

00:11:05.123 --> 00:11:06.583 position:50% align:center
[SELEN]
What about Sir Lloyd?

00:11:06.666 --> 00:11:08.376 position:50% align:center
No worries. I'll wait for him.

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:11.713 position:50% align:center
'Sides, I need to have a
chat with him about Alka.

00:11:11.796 --> 00:11:13.757 position:50% align:center
I'll send him along
after we're done.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:16.134 position:50% align:center
Another matter not for our ears?

00:11:16.217 --> 00:11:17.927 position:50% align:center
[EUG]
Ding, ding!

00:11:18.011 --> 00:11:20.388 position:50% align:center
[SELEN]
Very well, then.

00:11:25.185 --> 00:11:27.103 position:50% align:center
Sorry, guys!

00:11:27.187 --> 00:11:29.731 position:50% align:center
Didn't mean to take
so long saying goodbye.

00:11:29.814 --> 00:11:31.358 position:50% align:center
They've already gone.

00:11:31.441 --> 00:11:33.818 position:50% align:center
Speaking of which,
have you seen Alka?

00:11:33.902 --> 00:11:36.279 position:50% align:center
No. She's not here yet?

00:11:36.363 --> 00:11:39.240 position:50% align:center
Remember, for the time being
she's in a weakened state.

00:11:39.324 --> 00:11:41.076 position:50% align:center
She might've
collapsed somewhere.

00:11:41.159 --> 00:11:44.120 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD] Uh! That's a thing
that can happen? Oh, no!

00:11:44.204 --> 00:11:45.497 position:50% align:center
I better go find her!

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:47.707 position:50% align:center
Yeah, good idea!

00:11:54.297 --> 00:11:56.466 position:50% align:center
Wow, that took no time at all.

00:11:56.549 --> 00:11:58.551 position:50% align:center
Nice, huh?

00:11:58.635 --> 00:12:02.764 position:50% align:center
I never got to say farewell
to Merthophan. Poor freak.

00:12:03.765 --> 00:12:05.809 position:50% align:center
[MERTHOPHAN]
You called?

00:12:05.892 --> 00:12:07.310 position:50% align:center
What are you doing?

00:12:07.394 --> 00:12:09.145 position:50% align:center
What the--? How are you here?

00:12:09.229 --> 00:12:11.022 position:50% align:center
Crap! Are there others?

00:12:11.106 --> 00:12:13.191 position:50% align:center
Nah, just me.

00:12:13.274 --> 00:12:15.819 position:50% align:center
I wanted to give Miss Marie
a parting gift.

00:12:15.902 --> 00:12:18.363 position:50% align:center
Didn't have time for
a change of clothes.

00:12:18.446 --> 00:12:20.115 position:50% align:center
--Ah...
--Everything cool?

00:12:20.198 --> 00:12:21.533 position:50% align:center
Yeah, yeah, sure!

00:12:21.616 --> 00:12:25.078 position:50% align:center
I just didn't want the villagers
to get turned around.

00:12:25.161 --> 00:12:28.748 position:50% align:center
Oh. I'm sure they could find
their way home just fine.

00:12:28.832 --> 00:12:30.959 position:50% align:center
But I'll double check
when I go back through.

00:12:31.042 --> 00:12:33.253 position:50% align:center
[EUG] Uh. Sorry,
the gate's closed now.

00:12:33.336 --> 00:12:34.671 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasps]

00:12:34.754 --> 00:12:36.548 position:50% align:center
[EUG] We don't want Alka here
if she's on the warpath.

00:12:36.631 --> 00:12:38.049 position:50% align:center
But Sir Lloyd!

00:12:38.133 --> 00:12:41.720 position:50% align:center
What real choice did I have?
I left him to distract her.

00:12:41.803 --> 00:12:43.555 position:50% align:center
This can't be!

00:12:43.638 --> 00:12:46.599 position:50% align:center
He will stay in my
thoughts forever.

00:12:46.683 --> 00:12:48.685 position:50% align:center
Did I mention it's
just for one day?

00:12:48.768 --> 00:12:51.271 position:50% align:center
[MERTHOPHAN]
Hm... Damn. My crop.

00:12:51.354 --> 00:12:54.524 position:50% align:center
Aw, man. What a bummer.
I guess you're stuck.

00:12:54.607 --> 00:12:56.359 position:50% align:center
Why don't we make
the most of it?

00:12:56.443 --> 00:12:58.486 position:50% align:center
[MERTHOPHAN] Don't you need
to prep the exhibition match?

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:00.238 position:50% align:center
[CHOLINE]
Oh, Chrome can handle all that.

00:13:00.321 --> 00:13:04.701 position:50% align:center
--Eh? Wait! I can? Hey!
--[CHOLINE] Bye!

00:13:04.784 --> 00:13:08.329 position:50% align:center
[exhales] You three are
volunteering to help.

00:13:08.413 --> 00:13:10.123 position:50% align:center
[RIHO]
Huh?

00:13:10.206 --> 00:13:12.292 position:50% align:center
[CHROME] She hasn't smiled
like that in months.

00:13:12.375 --> 00:13:14.544 position:50% align:center
I'm not making her work.

00:13:18.506 --> 00:13:22.010 position:50% align:center
[EUG]
The plan's still intact. Mostly.

00:13:23.303 --> 00:13:26.473 position:50% align:center
This haul is about to make
me a very rich woman.

00:13:26.556 --> 00:13:29.100 position:50% align:center
[EUG]
You short on cash?

00:13:29.184 --> 00:13:31.436 position:50% align:center
Your gauntlet.
It's mithril, right?

00:13:31.519 --> 00:13:34.647 position:50% align:center
Say I made you a special
offer as a mutual of Alka's.

00:13:34.731 --> 00:13:36.608 position:50% align:center
I'd even be willing to fix up
the arm underneath

00:13:36.691 --> 00:13:39.110 position:50% align:center
if it's not too
sensitive a topic.

00:13:39.194 --> 00:13:41.780 position:50% align:center
I'm having trouble working out
whether being Alka's friend

00:13:41.863 --> 00:13:45.992 position:50% align:center
makes the offer better or worse.
Let me think it over for a bit.

00:13:46.076 --> 00:13:49.579 position:50% align:center
Take your time. If you're
interested, hit me up.

00:13:51.414 --> 00:13:54.501 position:50% align:center
"Fix up the arm underneath,"
huh? Weird.

00:13:54.584 --> 00:13:56.503 position:50% align:center
Dwarves must be able to
sense that kind of thing

00:13:56.586 --> 00:13:58.129 position:50% align:center
without looking.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:07.263 position:50% align:center
[RIHO laughing]
I am going to treat myself!

00:14:11.601 --> 00:14:14.145 position:50% align:center
This one's not gonna
be easy to unload.

00:14:14.229 --> 00:14:16.648 position:50% align:center
The silk's made by
magical spiders.

00:14:16.731 --> 00:14:18.858 position:50% align:center
Could an expert tell
I've worn them?

00:14:18.942 --> 00:14:20.068 position:50% align:center
Do I charge extra?

00:14:20.151 --> 00:14:21.736 position:50% align:center

Oh, Miss Mena. Hi.

00:14:25.532 --> 00:14:27.826 position:50% align:center
So, are you selling them
as a novelty item?

00:14:27.909 --> 00:14:29.327 position:50% align:center
What're you talking about?

00:14:29.411 --> 00:14:30.704 position:50% align:center
I dunno. Maybe?

00:14:30.787 --> 00:14:32.539 position:50% align:center
[MENA]
Huh?

00:14:32.622 --> 00:14:36.418 position:50% align:center
Huh. So the fairy tales
weren't so wild after all.

00:14:36.501 --> 00:14:38.837 position:50% align:center
Ha. If anything,
they were too tame.

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:41.965 position:50% align:center
No one would believe the truth.

00:14:42.048 --> 00:14:43.883 position:50% align:center
Aren't you supposed
to be working?

00:14:43.967 --> 00:14:45.051 position:50% align:center
Prepping for the match?

00:14:45.135 --> 00:14:47.053 position:50% align:center
Actually, I'm out on patrol.

00:14:47.137 --> 00:14:49.014 position:50% align:center
Huh...?

00:14:50.265 --> 00:14:55.103 position:50% align:center
Oh! Oh, these?
These are... gifts?

00:14:55.186 --> 00:14:56.855 position:50% align:center
[RIHO]
Like, for someone not you?

00:14:56.938 --> 00:15:00.150 position:50% align:center

Great. I have to buy more.

00:15:01.985 --> 00:15:04.446 position:50% align:center

Hm? Enter.

00:15:04.529 --> 00:15:06.281 position:50% align:center
How're we feeling today, Rol?

00:15:06.364 --> 00:15:07.782 position:50% align:center
Not bad. Thanks.

Here! Have some shish kabob.

00:15:11.494 --> 00:15:15.790 position:50% align:center
I might've helped myself to
one or two. Wha'cha doing?

00:15:15.874 --> 00:15:18.418 position:50% align:center
I just thought I'd be productive
with all this spare time,

00:15:18.501 --> 00:15:20.253 position:50% align:center
and write a book.

00:15:20.337 --> 00:15:23.631 position:50% align:center

you're on the road

Luckily, this Holy Sword

Oh! Have you, uh, been able
to remember anything about

00:15:48.365 --> 00:15:51.034 position:50% align:center
the guy who wanted you
to snag it for him?

an odd sound behind me.

Odd, how?

I'm not entirely sure, but I
feel as though we weren't alone.

00:16:18.895 --> 00:16:22.023 position:50% align:center
There was a small child
standing nearby.

00:16:22.107 --> 00:16:24.234 position:50% align:center
And it was the child
making the noise.

00:16:24.317 --> 00:16:26.361 position:50% align:center
Like a clicking, perhaps?

00:16:26.444 --> 00:16:28.196 position:50% align:center
Was the child eating candy?

00:16:28.279 --> 00:16:31.408 position:50% align:center

I'll be found, but only a fool

00:19:44.726 --> 00:19:49.522 position:50% align:center

00:19:49.606 --> 00:19:50.607 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD]
There you are!

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:53.026 position:50% align:center
I've been looking
all over for you!

00:19:55.195 --> 00:19:58.156 position:50% align:center
But how did you--?

00:19:58.239 --> 00:19:59.532 position:50% align:center
I thought you left!

00:19:59.616 --> 00:20:01.076 position:50% align:center
Eug told me I
ought'a look for you,

00:20:01.159 --> 00:20:03.119 position:50% align:center
so I tried the village first,

00:20:03.203 --> 00:20:05.747 position:50% align:center
and when you didn't turn up
there I searched the mountains.

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:07.165 position:50% align:center
You really shouldn't be
running around

00:20:07.248 --> 00:20:08.541 position:50% align:center
while your powers
are diminished.

00:20:08.625 --> 00:20:10.794 position:50% align:center
But what gave it away
that I was here?

00:20:10.877 --> 00:20:13.421 position:50% align:center
That's easy. Folks don't
usually come this far.

00:20:13.505 --> 00:20:16.049 position:50% align:center
I was afraid you'd
fallen in a hole.

00:20:16.132 --> 00:20:18.176 position:50% align:center
I fell into this same one
when I was a little kid

00:20:18.259 --> 00:20:19.052 position:50% align:center
and couldn't get out.

00:20:19.135 --> 00:20:20.720 position:50% align:center
Once I got that idea in my head,

00:20:20.804 --> 00:20:22.263 position:50% align:center
this was the first
place I looked.

00:20:22.347 --> 00:20:24.724 position:50% align:center
[ALKA] So in other words,
you got lucky.

00:20:24.808 --> 00:20:27.268 position:50% align:center
Well, that and the
rock looks fake.

00:20:27.352 --> 00:20:28.895 position:50% align:center
[ALKA]
It does?

00:20:28.978 --> 00:20:31.064 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD] Actually,
this is where I decided

00:20:31.147 --> 00:20:33.400 position:50% align:center
to follow in my
hero's footsteps.

00:20:33.483 --> 00:20:35.151 position:50% align:center
[ALKA]
Uh?

00:20:35.235 --> 00:20:38.363 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD] When I was rescued,
seeing everyone's faces was

00:20:38.446 --> 00:20:43.076 position:50% align:center
the best part. That's when
I knew I had to change.

00:20:43.159 --> 00:20:46.579 position:50% align:center
I chose right then and there to
be like the soldier in my book.

00:20:46.663 --> 00:20:47.956 position:50% align:center
For them.

00:20:48.039 --> 00:20:50.458 position:50% align:center
And you. Everyone.

00:20:50.542 --> 00:20:53.420 position:50% align:center
I had to be strong so I could
help where I was needed,

00:20:53.503 --> 00:20:55.797 position:50% align:center
to be a face in the light.

00:20:57.924 --> 00:21:01.511 position:50% align:center
That probably sounded arrogant,
'specially as weak as I am.

00:21:01.594 --> 00:21:04.055 position:50% align:center
Sorry.

00:21:04.139 --> 00:21:05.557 position:50% align:center

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:10.603 position:50% align:center

to do than you.

00:21:10.687 --> 00:21:15.066 position:50% align:center
Thank you...

00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:17.819 position:50% align:center

is worth saving.

Anyone who thinks I'm
going to let them destroy it

00:21:20.196 --> 00:21:22.282 position:50% align:center

Professor. How goes it?

00:21:26.911 --> 00:21:30.165 position:50% align:center
Marvelously.

00:21:30.248 --> 00:21:32.125 position:50% align:center
No more surprises.

00:21:32.208 --> 00:21:33.626 position:50% align:center

sewn up on your end...

00:21:49.142 --> 00:21:50.810 position:50% align:center
And that makes her ready?

00:21:50.894 --> 00:21:54.314 position:50% align:center
Not quite, but her
compulsory obedience does.

00:21:54.397 --> 00:21:58.693 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh. Well, almost time.

00:21:58.777 --> 00:22:02.864 position:50% align:center
Tomorrow, it's all or nothing.

00:22:06.201 --> 00:22:07.994 position:50% align:center
I talked to Grampa Pyrid
before I left.

00:22:08.078 --> 00:22:10.747 position:50% align:center
He told me that the gate
to Azami is broken.

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:13.750 position:50% align:center
Yep. That definitely
fits Eug's MO.

00:22:13.833 --> 00:22:15.126 position:50% align:center
Aw, man.

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:18.588 position:50% align:center
I told Alan I'd cheer him on
in the exhibition match.

00:22:18.672 --> 00:22:20.048 position:50% align:center
I made a promise!

00:22:20.131 --> 00:22:22.050 position:50% align:center
Heh. You're so adorable.

00:22:22.133 --> 00:22:24.344 position:50% align:center
Thank you? But what do we do?

00:22:24.427 --> 00:22:28.181 position:50% align:center
[ALKA] Fear not!
Alka has cooked up a plan.

00:22:28.264 --> 00:22:31.309 position:50% align:center
Onward to the village,
post haste!

00:22:31.393 --> 00:22:32.852 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD]
You got it!
