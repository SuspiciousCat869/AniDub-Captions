00:08:50.739 --> 00:08:53.533 position:50% align:center
such as "hero," "immortal,"
and yes, "human."

00:08:53.616 --> 00:08:56.953 position:50% align:center
Runes? Hold on.
What is it you're trying to say?

00:08:57.037 --> 00:09:00.123 position:50% align:center
[SOU] Long ago, when
the world thrashed in chaos,

00:09:00.206 --> 00:09:04.085 position:50% align:center
I was created as a beacon
of hope for humanity.

00:09:04.169 --> 00:09:07.213 position:50% align:center
By Alka, using
the ancient runes.

00:09:07.297 --> 00:09:10.508 position:50% align:center
Once order was restored,
I was meant to vanish.

00:09:10.592 --> 00:09:15.013 position:50% align:center
And yet, I endured.

00:09:15.096 --> 00:09:18.933 position:50% align:center
Yoked like a beast of burden
to an obsolete existence,

00:09:19.017 --> 00:09:23.646 position:50% align:center
I was a pathetic phantom,
a shell of a hero.

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:24.856 position:50% align:center
As time wore on,

00:09:24.939 --> 00:09:28.485 position:50% align:center
the contours of my very
being began to fade.

00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:34.115 position:50% align:center
So unstable became my presence
that no two people saw me alike.

00:09:34.199 --> 00:09:36.659 position:50% align:center
If there's even a fraction
of truth to all this,

00:09:36.743 --> 00:09:39.037 position:50% align:center
what could conceivably
drive a former hero

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.955 position:50% align:center
to such wicked behavior?

00:09:41.039 --> 00:09:45.543 position:50% align:center
The promise of blessed oblivion.
To vanish completely.

00:09:45.627 --> 00:09:47.837 position:50% align:center
I must slay Alka, anoint a hero,

00:09:47.921 --> 00:09:50.924 position:50% align:center
and become
the root of all evil.

00:09:51.007 --> 00:09:54.886 position:50% align:center
Only when I cease to be
the hero am I free to die.

00:09:54.969 --> 00:09:58.390 position:50% align:center
And just whom will you "anoint?"

00:09:58.473 --> 00:10:01.226 position:50% align:center
Who else? Lloyd Belladonna.

He made it!

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:25.667 position:50% align:center
I had no doubt!

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:27.043 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow.

Wait! That's not fair!

Eh...?

00:10:36.052 --> 00:10:38.346 position:50% align:center
See, I promised Sir Alan
I'd be here to cheer him on,

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:39.889 position:50% align:center
but I kinda got sidetracked.

00:10:39.973 --> 00:10:41.558 position:50% align:center
I had to call in
a bunch of favors

00:10:41.641 --> 00:10:43.601 position:50% align:center
from the folks back home
to make it at all.

00:10:43.685 --> 00:10:45.228 position:50% align:center
[EUG]
Nuh-uh! No way getting here

00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:47.313 position:50% align:center
was just a matter
of networking!

00:10:47.397 --> 00:10:49.024 position:50% align:center
Oh. Ms. Eug.

00:10:49.107 --> 00:10:51.651 position:50% align:center
Um, the Chief had a
lot to say about you.

00:10:51.735 --> 00:10:53.987 position:50% align:center
Heh. Well, that's a little
disappointing. Meh.

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:57.657 position:50% align:center
Don't take it too seriously,
she's prone to exaggerate.

00:10:58.742 --> 00:11:00.618 position:50% align:center
If you couldn't bring
Vritra back like you said,

00:11:00.702 --> 00:11:02.120 position:50% align:center
you should've owned up
to it and stayed behind

00:11:02.203 --> 00:11:04.080 position:50% align:center
to help us figure things out
instead of running away

00:11:04.164 --> 00:11:05.290 position:50% align:center
and sealing the gate

00:11:05.373 --> 00:11:07.459 position:50% align:center
like that's the answer
to all life's problems!

00:11:07.542 --> 00:11:08.418 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:09.836 position:50% align:center
Don't you "huh" me!

[EUG]
Kid, you've got it backwards!

00:11:14.049 --> 00:11:16.509 position:50% align:center
I refused to revive
Vritra on purpose!

00:11:16.593 --> 00:11:18.762 position:50% align:center
Look, my master plan is
to bring the world to heel

00:11:18.845 --> 00:11:20.513 position:50% align:center
by filling it with Demon Lords.

00:11:22.265 --> 00:11:24.768 position:50% align:center

stuff up! I'm not stupid.

00:11:24.851 --> 00:11:26.936 position:50% align:center

We're in a bit of
a pickle right now.

You might have noticed the bugs?

00:11:36.363 --> 00:11:39.157 position:50% align:center
Turns out Eug smuggled in some
eggs and now they've hatched.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.659 position:50% align:center
Can't start the match till
the stadium's de-loused.

00:11:41.743 --> 00:11:44.162 position:50% align:center
Huh? You know, I thought
there were more locusts

this time of year.

00:11:45.872 --> 00:11:46.790 position:50% align:center
Exactly!

Speaking of eggs,
that reminds me

00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:51.086 position:50% align:center
of something else the chief
said. I need to destroy the one

you've got Vritra
imprisoned in!

00:11:53.546 --> 00:11:55.674 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna ask you
very nicely, Eug!

00:11:55.757 --> 00:11:58.009 position:50% align:center
Give it to me without
making a big fuss.

00:17:58.286 --> 00:17:59.746 position:50% align:center
this whole debacle
is your fault!

00:17:59.829 --> 00:18:01.539 position:50% align:center
Now come out of there
and make things right!

00:18:01.623 --> 00:18:04.042 position:50% align:center
Or are you above heeding
your master all of a sudden?

00:18:04.125 --> 00:18:05.251 position:50% align:center
[EUG]
Um, excuse me.

00:18:05.335 --> 00:18:07.128 position:50% align:center
[SELEN]
Fine! Have it your way!

00:18:07.212 --> 00:18:09.089 position:50% align:center
To wit, let us review
the sacred teachings

00:18:09.172 --> 00:18:11.591 position:50% align:center
of Sir Lloyd the Inevitable,
chapters 1 through 73,

00:18:11.675 --> 00:18:12.842 position:50% align:center
beginning with
a nightly recitation

00:18:12.926 --> 00:18:14.427 position:50% align:center
of his vital statistics
such as height, weight,

00:18:14.511 --> 00:18:16.429 position:50% align:center
eye color, shoe size
and personal hygiene.

00:18:16.513 --> 00:18:17.931 position:50% align:center
You will be expected
to draw a tasteful,

00:18:18.014 --> 00:18:19.099 position:50% align:center
lifelike rendering of Sir Lloyd

00:18:19.182 --> 00:18:20.558 position:50% align:center
every morning
with your eyes closed.

00:18:20.642 --> 00:18:21.976 position:50% align:center
And in the afternoon.
And in the evening.

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:23.645 position:50% align:center
At bedtime.
The medium will be charcoal.

00:18:23.728 --> 00:18:25.021 position:50% align:center
The Teachings, Chapter One:

00:18:25.105 --> 00:18:27.357 position:50% align:center
his smile is as the sun after
a frightful tempest.

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.484 position:50% align:center
His laughter, the peel of bells
cast from molten gold,

00:18:29.567 --> 00:18:30.819 position:50% align:center
signifying an
economic miracle.

00:18:30.902 --> 00:18:32.904 position:50% align:center
His heartbeat, the rhythm
of all living things.

00:18:32.987 --> 00:18:34.948 position:50% align:center
His footfalls, the record
of creation itself.

00:18:35.031 --> 00:18:36.658 position:50% align:center
We so blessed with
the privilege of study

00:18:36.741 --> 00:18:38.993 position:50% align:center
must commit his deeds to memory,
that they may live on.

00:18:39.077 --> 00:18:40.870 position:50% align:center
We raise our voices in song,
from dawn to dusk,

00:18:40.954 --> 00:18:42.539 position:50% align:center
cradle to grave,
flagstone to window,

00:18:42.622 --> 00:18:44.499 position:50% align:center
forever letting ring out
for all and sundry to hear.

00:18:44.582 --> 00:18:46.584 position:50% align:center
Sir Lloyd! Sir Lloyd!
Sir Lloyd!

00:18:46.668 --> 00:18:49.838 position:50% align:center
[VRITRA screaming] Enough!
I can't take it anymore!

00:18:49.921 --> 00:18:50.922 position:50% align:center
I'll do anything you ask!

00:18:51.006 --> 00:18:53.341 position:50% align:center
Just please stop talking
about Sir Lloyd!

00:18:53.425 --> 00:18:55.677 position:50% align:center
How did he unseal himself?

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:57.387 position:50% align:center
The benefits of education.

00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:59.305 position:50% align:center
[EUG]
What education?!

00:18:59.389 --> 00:19:00.890 position:50% align:center

Blow away! Aero!

00:19:18.241 --> 00:19:19.993 position:50% align:center
He got him!

00:19:20.076 --> 00:19:21.202 position:50% align:center
I knew he would!

00:19:21.286 --> 00:19:22.996 position:50% align:center
He... He crushed my golem!

00:19:23.079 --> 00:19:24.706 position:50% align:center
A little help here? Guys?

00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:27.208 position:50% align:center
Mind coming down here
and taking these jerks out?

00:19:27.292 --> 00:19:29.044 position:50% align:center
[SOU]
A new generation of hero

Azami from danger.

00:19:31.796 --> 00:19:35.050 position:50% align:center
Yes! The first phase
is executed flawlessly!

Looks like we're almost
there, big guy!

Over here, Lloyd!
Smile for the shot!

Shoma, is that you?

00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:45.810 position:50% align:center
Lloyd! Yes. You. There. Boy.
Kindly describe how I appear!

00:19:45.894 --> 00:19:48.897 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD] You're that evil-looking
guy from the other day!

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:50.940 position:50% align:center
Truthful words said plainly.

00:19:51.024 --> 00:19:53.651 position:50% align:center
A most worthy successor
has been confirmed!

00:19:53.735 --> 00:19:55.236 position:50% align:center
Super intense!

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:56.738 position:50% align:center
[EUG]
Oh, right.

00:19:56.821 --> 00:19:58.823 position:50% align:center
The only reason these clowns
helped me in the first place

00:19:58.907 --> 00:20:00.617 position:50% align:center
was to make Lloyd a hero.

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:02.035 position:50% align:center
Curse you, Alka.

00:20:02.118 --> 00:20:04.954 position:50% align:center
You knew this would happen!
That's why you sent him!

00:20:15.882 --> 00:20:19.886 position:50% align:center
[ALKA] So, uh... Now would be
a good time to surrender.

00:20:19.969 --> 00:20:21.054 position:50% align:center
Shut up!

00:20:21.137 --> 00:20:23.306 position:50% align:center
Eug does not roll over
and call it quits!

The power of the Last
Dungeon will be mine!

00:20:26.643 --> 00:20:30.230 position:50% align:center
I'll remake this world
a thousand times if I have to!

[ALKA] See, that's where you
and I part ways.

00:20:32.691 --> 00:20:37.070 position:50% align:center
I'm of the opinion
the world is fine as is.

00:20:37.153 --> 00:20:41.741 position:50% align:center
You're at liberty to disagree,
but that's about it.

[ALKA]
Shoma. Sou?

00:20:45.286 --> 00:20:48.164 position:50% align:center
Much as I'd like to kill you,
the hour is not ripe.

00:20:48.248 --> 00:20:50.250 position:50% align:center
My day will come, old friend.

00:20:50.333 --> 00:20:52.043 position:50% align:center
In the meantime,
I shall occupy myself

00:20:52.127 --> 00:20:54.462 position:50% align:center
by editing footage of Sir Lloyd.

00:20:54.546 --> 00:20:55.505 position:50% align:center
Same here!

00:20:55.588 --> 00:20:57.173 position:50% align:center
Don't think me
going on the DL means

00:20:57.257 --> 00:21:00.343 position:50% align:center
I'm not watching out
for you, little bro!

[SOU]
Our future misdeeds will be,

00:21:02.595 --> 00:21:06.891 position:50% align:center
as Shoma would
say, "super intense."

00:21:31.875 --> 00:21:34.210 position:50% align:center
[MARIE] Lloyd! You sure you
don't need any help?

Nah, I'm fine, thanks.

without stepping on my head?!

00:21:43.261 --> 00:21:45.055 position:50% align:center

Forgive the haste.

Are you? Well, by all means
do your worst, fledgling!

Incidentally,
given your forked tongue,

00:21:59.402 --> 00:22:00.779 position:50% align:center
with the appropriate
rune I think

00:22:00.862 --> 00:22:02.447 position:50% align:center
you'd make an excellent lizard.

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:03.698 position:50% align:center
That's funny.

00:22:03.782 --> 00:22:05.450 position:50% align:center
I was just thinking the
same thing about you.

Bring it on, neophyte!

Could you not toss off jokes
about the end of humanity?

00:22:14.292 --> 00:22:15.377 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

Hey! Why'd you clock me?

00:22:17.045 --> 00:22:19.297 position:50% align:center
You were blocking the entryway,
what else was I supposed to do?

00:22:19.381 --> 00:22:22.008 position:50% align:center
Sheesh. Lloyd! I'd love a black
coffee, if you don't mind.

Gee, hope I made enough!
