Hey, hey!

Look who I found.

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:48.506 position:50% align:center
Very good. Kindly describe
how I appear to you.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:54.262 position:50% align:center
Well, I guess...
you're some kind of priest.

00:00:54.346 --> 00:00:57.849 position:50% align:center
[SOU] Hm... Inaccurate,
but not wide of the mark.

00:00:57.932 --> 00:01:00.602 position:50% align:center
I suppose the
resemblance is strong.

00:01:00.685 --> 00:01:04.230 position:50% align:center
It's so sad. Some rude jerk's
gone and broken her heart.

00:01:04.314 --> 00:01:07.317 position:50% align:center
I see. What would
she like to do?

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.446 position:50% align:center
I want him dead,
and by my hand!

00:01:11.529 --> 00:01:13.406 position:50% align:center
Only when his life
has been snuffed out

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.992 position:50% align:center

Mm-hm... Give her the items.

What are these?

00:01:23.792 --> 00:01:26.795 position:50% align:center
Medicine. Knock 'em back, and
you'll get crazy intense powers.

00:01:26.878 --> 00:01:28.755 position:50% align:center
Yep. One is essence of treant.

00:01:28.838 --> 00:01:32.008 position:50% align:center
The other is Abaddon's Curse.

00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:36.513 position:50% align:center

00:04:06.746 --> 00:04:08.289 position:50% align:center
Go on.

Don't give her ideas.

Sorry. That was rude of me.

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.644 position:50% align:center
I should have told you they were
dropping by to pick me up.

00:04:29.728 --> 00:04:31.187 position:50% align:center
To do what?

00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:33.815 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah. Check it out. We've
been summoned to the castle.

00:04:33.898 --> 00:04:35.150 position:50% align:center
Neat, huh?

00:04:35.233 --> 00:04:38.820 position:50% align:center
[MARIE] The king wants you
to find a giant snake?

00:04:38.903 --> 00:04:42.073 position:50% align:center
[RIHO] Cool, right? It's lurking
in a nearby dungeon.

You're actively putting Lloyd

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:56.087 position:50% align:center
in danger! Wait.
Why am I worried?

00:04:56.171 --> 00:04:58.465 position:50% align:center
I'll admit I'm garbage
at exploring dungeons.

But hey, I have to learn
one way or the other.

00:05:01.176 --> 00:05:03.386 position:50% align:center

know how to track.

You're getting carried
away by a dumb fantasy.

After all, you've been

you a massage at the hotel!

Well, I for one would
like an explanation!

But why, though?

What's a treant doing...?

00:09:39.996 --> 00:09:42.082 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:42.165 --> 00:09:44.417 position:50% align:center
[MARIE]
Micona!

00:09:46.127 --> 00:09:49.381 position:50% align:center
[MARIE]
Oh, no! How did this happen?

00:09:49.464 --> 00:09:51.841 position:50% align:center
Does she have a parasite?

00:09:54.594 --> 00:09:55.428 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:55.512 --> 00:09:57.889 position:50% align:center
Miss Marie! It's really you!

00:09:57.972 --> 00:10:00.809 position:50% align:center
I never thought I'd see you
in a place like this!

00:10:00.892 --> 00:10:05.522 position:50% align:center
[MARIE] Likewise!
What in the world is going on?

00:10:05.605 --> 00:10:09.109 position:50% align:center
I'm waiting for someone.
I must have vengeance.

00:10:09.192 --> 00:10:10.694 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:10.777 --> 00:10:13.071 position:50% align:center
[MARIE]
She's been infested by a treant.

00:10:13.154 --> 00:10:16.032 position:50% align:center
I can't handle this on my own.

00:10:16.116 --> 00:10:19.411 position:50% align:center
[MARIE] Um, may I ask
who you're waiting for?

00:10:19.494 --> 00:10:20.954 position:50% align:center
[MICONA]
An insidious thief.

00:10:21.037 --> 00:10:23.081 position:50% align:center
He stole the object
of my desire.

00:10:23.164 --> 00:10:26.001 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Did I just walk
into a love triangle?

00:10:26.084 --> 00:10:28.795 position:50% align:center
My heart was in tatters.
I felt lost.

00:10:28.878 --> 00:10:31.089 position:50% align:center
[MARIE] Right. That's awful.
Totally get it.

00:10:31.172 --> 00:10:33.508 position:50% align:center
But, um, I'm still waiting
to hear a name,

00:10:33.591 --> 00:10:35.677 position:50% align:center
if you're comfortable sharing?

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.263 position:50% align:center
[MICONA]
Lloyd Belladonna.

00:10:38.346 --> 00:10:39.347 position:50% align:center
[MARIE]
Huh...?

00:10:39.431 --> 00:10:41.057 position:50% align:center
Lloyd came between
Micona and the man

00:10:41.141 --> 00:10:43.852 position:50% align:center
of her dreams? But, oh god!

00:10:43.935 --> 00:10:45.937 position:50% align:center
I mean he's a catch,
no question,

00:10:46.021 --> 00:10:48.064 position:50% align:center
and those homemaking skills?
Chef's kiss.

00:10:48.148 --> 00:10:50.567 position:50% align:center
But I have to say,
I did not see that coming!

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:52.652 position:50% align:center
So, who is it you
have a thing for?

00:10:52.736 --> 00:10:54.404 position:50% align:center
[MARIE]
He'd better treat him right!

00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:56.322 position:50% align:center
No, please! I can't say!

00:10:56.406 --> 00:10:58.533 position:50% align:center
Hey, it's fine. No pressure.

00:10:58.616 --> 00:11:02.954 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry... Forgive me!

00:11:03.038 --> 00:11:04.039 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Micona!

00:11:04.122 --> 00:11:05.623 position:50% align:center
[MICONA panting]

00:11:05.707 --> 00:11:07.208 position:50% align:center
[MICONA]
Don't worry.

00:11:07.292 --> 00:11:09.961 position:50% align:center
I won't drain your life force.
I just need to put you in peril

00:11:10.045 --> 00:11:11.880 position:50% align:center
so Lloyd will come
to the rescue!

00:11:11.963 --> 00:11:13.381 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty worried!

00:11:13.465 --> 00:11:15.425 position:50% align:center
You need to put me down
right this instant!

00:11:15.508 --> 00:11:16.593 position:50% align:center
But I can't!

00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:18.803 position:50% align:center
This is the awful burden
of a broken heart!

00:11:18.887 --> 00:11:20.055 position:50% align:center
Come, Sir Lloyd!

00:11:20.138 --> 00:11:22.599 position:50% align:center
Answer my challenge--
when it's convenient.

00:11:22.682 --> 00:11:24.267 position:50% align:center
[MARIE]
When it's what?

00:11:24.351 --> 00:11:25.602 position:50% align:center
[MARIE]
She's gone mad.

00:11:25.685 --> 00:11:28.646 position:50% align:center
The treant must've dug
its roots into her brain!

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:32.484 position:50% align:center
[MICONA gasping]
Marie! I've dreamed of this.

00:11:32.567 --> 00:11:36.571 position:50% align:center
[MARIE whimpers]
A little help here, Lloyd!

00:11:37.864 --> 00:11:39.282 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD]
Miss Marie!

00:11:39.366 --> 00:11:40.992 position:50% align:center
Oh! That didn't take long!

00:11:41.076 --> 00:11:42.494 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD]
I knew something was off.

00:11:42.577 --> 00:11:45.121 position:50% align:center
[MICONA] Tch. You could've
given us a few minutes.

00:11:45.205 --> 00:11:46.956 position:50% align:center
I thought he was
the whole point!

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.250 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD]
Miss Micona. Is this...?

00:11:49.334 --> 00:11:52.128 position:50% align:center
[MICONA] Hmph. Behold the
vessel of your destruction.

00:11:52.212 --> 00:11:54.547 position:50% align:center
Today you die!

00:11:57.801 --> 00:11:59.219 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD]
I would really appreciate it

00:11:59.302 --> 00:12:00.679 position:50% align:center
if you'd put Miss Marie down.

00:12:00.762 --> 00:12:01.846 position:50% align:center
[MICONA]
Ugh...

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:03.264 position:50% align:center
Owie!

00:12:03.348 --> 00:12:05.850 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Fight me, Sir Lloyd!
Show me what you've got.

00:12:05.934 --> 00:12:09.229 position:50% align:center
Otherwise I shall do unspeakable
things to this poor woman,

00:12:09.312 --> 00:12:10.980 position:50% align:center
meaning it's perfectly
all right if you don't.

00:12:11.064 --> 00:12:12.482 position:50% align:center
[MARIE]
Um, we can hear you.

00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:13.733 position:50% align:center
And I'm validated.

00:12:13.817 --> 00:12:14.609 position:50% align:center
[MARIE]
Huh?

00:12:14.693 --> 00:12:16.903 position:50% align:center
Have it your way. Let's do this.

00:12:16.986 --> 00:12:18.446 position:50% align:center
Excellent idea!

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:20.198 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:12:25.537 --> 00:12:28.081 position:50% align:center
I will rip you to shreds!

00:12:35.505 --> 00:12:37.298 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD]
Take that!

00:12:38.299 --> 00:12:42.971 position:50% align:center
Time to pull out the reserve
arsenal! Godspeed!

00:12:43.054 --> 00:12:44.889 position:50% align:center
[MICONA yells]

00:12:46.975 --> 00:12:47.809 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:12:47.892 --> 00:12:50.061 position:50% align:center
I've got you!

00:12:50.145 --> 00:12:52.355 position:50% align:center
Your back's against the wall!

00:12:52.439 --> 00:12:54.190 position:50% align:center
[MARIE]
Stop it! This isn't who you are!

00:12:54.274 --> 00:12:56.026 position:50% align:center
He only has himself to blame!

00:12:56.109 --> 00:12:59.654 position:50% align:center
You hear that?
You turned me into a monster!

00:13:01.656 --> 00:13:03.908 position:50% align:center
[MICONA grunts]

00:13:03.992 --> 00:13:06.995 position:50% align:center
[MICONA] What the...? Damn it!
Why aren't you pulverized yet?

00:13:07.078 --> 00:13:10.165 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD] Yeah. This kind of thing
happens a lot back home.

00:13:10.248 --> 00:13:11.458 position:50% align:center
That's crazy talk!

00:13:11.541 --> 00:13:14.377 position:50% align:center
What sort of backwater place
are you even from?

00:13:14.461 --> 00:13:15.503 position:50% align:center
Just Kunlun.

00:13:15.587 --> 00:13:17.088 position:50% align:center
[MICONA panting]

00:13:17.172 --> 00:13:19.132 position:50% align:center
No! That's a fairy story!

00:13:19.215 --> 00:13:22.427 position:50% align:center
You're mocking me!

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:23.803 position:50% align:center
Where do you think
you're going?

00:13:23.887 --> 00:13:25.680 position:50% align:center
This discussion
is far from over!

00:13:25.764 --> 00:13:27.182 position:50% align:center
Would you it a rest?

00:13:27.265 --> 00:13:30.935 position:50% align:center
We'll never find the snake
if I keep indulging you morons!

00:13:31.019 --> 00:13:31.936 position:50% align:center
What is that?

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:34.731 position:50% align:center
No earthly idea,
but it sounds big.

00:13:36.524 --> 00:13:39.319 position:50% align:center
Call me negative, but I feel
like that's not a good sign.

00:13:39.402 --> 00:13:42.989 position:50% align:center
I hope they're okay.
C'mon guys.

00:13:43.073 --> 00:13:44.657 position:50% align:center
[RIHO]
Holy!

00:13:47.077 --> 00:13:50.246 position:50% align:center
Quickly! Run for cover!

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:51.331 position:50% align:center
That's my cue.

00:13:51.414 --> 00:13:52.874 position:50% align:center
[gaps] Look out!

00:13:52.957 --> 00:13:54.334 position:50% align:center
[MICONA groans]

00:13:54.793 --> 00:13:55.669 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD grunts]

00:13:55.752 --> 00:13:57.337 position:50% align:center
--Lloyd, no!
--My darling!

00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:58.588 position:50% align:center
[PHYLLO]
Master!

00:13:58.672 --> 00:13:59.631 position:50% align:center
[RIHO]
Is that the snake?

00:13:59.714 --> 00:14:01.883 position:50% align:center
[SELEN]
No! That's Micona!

00:14:01.966 --> 00:14:03.426 position:50% align:center
[RIHO]
But why?

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:07.472 position:50% align:center
[MICONA laughs] Let this be
a lesson to you, Belladonna!

00:14:07.555 --> 00:14:08.848 position:50% align:center
Friends make you weak!

00:14:08.932 --> 00:14:11.851 position:50% align:center
You take that back!
That's not true!

00:14:11.935 --> 00:14:13.561 position:50% align:center
They make you invincible!

00:14:13.645 --> 00:14:15.146 position:50% align:center
[MICONA]
What?

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:18.274 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD] I might not be strong.
I might not ever be a soldier!

00:14:18.358 --> 00:14:21.111 position:50% align:center
But ya know what?
I won't be alone, either!

00:14:21.194 --> 00:14:23.655 position:50% align:center
Maybe you don't
need people, but I do.

00:14:23.738 --> 00:14:26.783 position:50% align:center
In fact, I owe my
friends everything!

00:14:26.866 --> 00:14:29.285 position:50% align:center
They're the people
I wanna be strong for!

00:14:29.369 --> 00:14:32.205 position:50% align:center
My heroes. So I'm
gonna deal with you,

00:14:32.288 --> 00:14:35.709 position:50% align:center
beat the giant snake, and work
my butt off to be worthy

00:14:35.792 --> 00:14:38.003 position:50% align:center
of the support
they've given me!

00:14:38.086 --> 00:14:38.878 position:50% align:center
[RIHO]
Lloyd...

00:14:38.962 --> 00:14:40.005 position:50% align:center
[PHYLLO]
Master...

00:14:40.088 --> 00:14:41.506 position:50% align:center
That was beautiful.

00:14:41.589 --> 00:14:43.216 position:50% align:center
It sure was.

00:14:43.299 --> 00:14:45.844 position:50% align:center
Shut up! Stop spouting
sentimental crap

00:14:45.927 --> 00:14:48.304 position:50% align:center
and accept defeat!

00:14:48.388 --> 00:14:50.181 position:50% align:center
[MICONA yelling]

00:14:50.265 --> 00:14:52.350 position:50% align:center

[LLOYD yelling]

00:14:55.812 --> 00:14:59.232 position:50% align:center
I will erase your existence!

00:15:02.193 --> 00:15:03.069 position:50% align:center
We have to leave.

00:15:03.153 --> 00:15:05.488 position:50% align:center
Make a run for the tunnel!

00:15:05.572 --> 00:15:07.699 position:50% align:center
[MARIE screams]

00:15:08.908 --> 00:15:13.663 position:50% align:center
[ALL screaming]

00:15:20.045 --> 00:15:20.837 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD grunts]

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:23.715 position:50% align:center
Out of fancy tricks, are we?

00:15:23.798 --> 00:15:26.134 position:50% align:center
You've been a surprising foe,

00:15:26.217 --> 00:15:29.596 position:50% align:center
but the time has
come to end this!

00:15:33.516 --> 00:15:37.062 position:50% align:center
Well said. I couldn't agree
more, Micona. It's over.

00:15:37.145 --> 00:15:38.355 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:40.523 --> 00:15:41.983 position:50% align:center
[MICONA]
What the--?

00:15:43.026 --> 00:15:44.903 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD]
Here we go!

00:15:44.986 --> 00:15:47.822 position:50% align:center
[screaming] This is impossible!

00:15:47.906 --> 00:15:51.785 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD yelling]

00:15:52.827 --> 00:15:55.080 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD]
This is goodbye!

00:15:55.163 --> 00:15:55.997 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD yells]

00:15:56.081 --> 00:16:01.378 position:50% align:center
[MICONA screaming]

00:16:02.504 --> 00:16:07.217 position:50% align:center
[panting] I did it.

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:08.385 position:50% align:center
[MARIE]
Lloyd!

00:16:08.468 --> 00:16:09.552 position:50% align:center
Nice job!

00:16:09.636 --> 00:16:11.262 position:50% align:center
I've never seen a more
impressive fight!

00:16:11.346 --> 00:16:14.057 position:50% align:center
Kudos, Master.

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:18.019 position:50% align:center
[VRITRA] I'd say that's a
significant understatement.

00:16:18.103 --> 00:16:21.272 position:50% align:center
It stirred me from my slumber!

00:16:21.356 --> 00:16:24.275 position:50% align:center
Goodness! Look at
how big you are.

00:16:24.359 --> 00:16:26.236 position:50% align:center
You've sprouted like a spruce!

00:16:26.319 --> 00:16:27.237 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Huh...?

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:29.739 position:50% align:center
Have, uh, have we met?

00:16:29.823 --> 00:16:33.243 position:50% align:center
[VRITRA] Heh, heh. Seriously?
Must've slipped your memory.

00:16:33.326 --> 00:16:35.286 position:50% align:center
Then again, you were small.

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:37.956 position:50% align:center
[SELEN]
Uh, are you the giant snake?

00:16:38.039 --> 00:16:40.500 position:50% align:center
[VRITRA]
How uncivilized of me.

00:16:40.583 --> 00:16:45.296 position:50% align:center
I failed to introduce myself.
I am Vritra, Guardian of Kunlun.

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:46.631 position:50% align:center
What does that mean?

00:16:46.715 --> 00:16:49.426 position:50% align:center
[VRITRA] Essentially,
I protect magical seals

00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:51.636 position:50% align:center
and safeguard Alka's power.

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:53.805 position:50% align:center
[MARIE]
Huh! Didn't know that.

00:16:53.888 --> 00:16:55.807 position:50% align:center
Okay, so what are
you doing here?

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:58.309 position:50% align:center
[VRITRA]
Wait! Haven't you heard?

00:16:58.393 --> 00:17:00.937 position:50% align:center
I assumed she would have said.

00:17:01.021 --> 00:17:04.858 position:50% align:center
So conspicuously
spurious of her.

00:17:04.941 --> 00:17:07.027 position:50% align:center
That senile sprite!

00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:09.404 position:50% align:center
Do you know she once tried to
make an apron out of my skin?

00:17:09.487 --> 00:17:14.784 position:50% align:center
She sliced me with Excalibur!
Me! The Guardian of Kunlun!

00:17:14.868 --> 00:17:19.372 position:50% align:center
Needless to say, she
sorely tests my patience!

00:17:19.456 --> 00:17:23.626 position:50% align:center
Ooh, oh, so sorry. That was
severely discourteous.

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:25.920 position:50% align:center
[MARIE]
She has that effect on people.

00:17:26.004 --> 00:17:29.632 position:50% align:center
But I don't understand why
you gave Micona the treant.

00:17:29.716 --> 00:17:32.344 position:50% align:center
[SOU]
That was my doing.

00:17:39.851 --> 00:17:44.439 position:50% align:center
[SOU] Boy. Kindly describe
how I appear to you.

00:17:48.026 --> 00:17:50.528 position:50% align:center
Tell you the truth?
You look evil.

00:17:50.612 --> 00:17:55.742 position:50% align:center
[SOU] Ah, do I?
Perhaps it's you. Tell me!

00:17:55.825 --> 00:17:58.578 position:50% align:center
Does your every thought
hinge on becoming a hero?

00:17:58.661 --> 00:18:01.373 position:50% align:center
Are you a seeker of strength?
Are you good?

00:18:01.456 --> 00:18:04.834 position:50% align:center
Do you wish to fight evil?
To protect what you love?

00:18:04.918 --> 00:18:07.087 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD] That's why I
enlisted to be a soldier.

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:09.464 position:50% align:center
[SOU]
Then you must--

00:18:09.547 --> 00:18:10.590 position:50% align:center
[GROUP yelps]

00:18:10.674 --> 00:18:13.259 position:50% align:center
There you are, Sou! Ha!

00:18:13.343 --> 00:18:15.470 position:50% align:center
[MARIE grunting]

00:18:15.553 --> 00:18:16.596 position:50% align:center
Who's he?

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:18.765 position:50% align:center
You haven't changed
a bit, have you?

00:18:18.848 --> 00:18:20.308 position:50% align:center
Calm yourself, Alka.

00:18:20.392 --> 00:18:22.727 position:50% align:center
We're in the company
of an old acquaintance.

00:18:22.811 --> 00:18:24.479 position:50% align:center
What are you talking about?

00:18:24.562 --> 00:18:26.898 position:50% align:center
Hm? Vritra! Why are you here?

00:18:26.981 --> 00:18:29.943 position:50% align:center
[VRITRA] I would choose
your words cautiously.

00:18:30.026 --> 00:18:32.153 position:50% align:center
Oh. I mean, hey?

00:18:32.237 --> 00:18:35.156 position:50% align:center
[VRITRA] Satyr! How can
you be so insensitive?

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:38.493 position:50% align:center
I think a better word
would be sociopath.

00:18:38.576 --> 00:18:41.621 position:50% align:center
[VRITRA grunts]
What are you doing?

00:18:41.705 --> 00:18:43.456 position:50% align:center
Jumping at an excellent chance.

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:45.625 position:50% align:center
You let yourself get
distracted, my friend.

00:18:45.709 --> 00:18:47.836 position:50% align:center
[VRITRA]
What?

00:18:47.919 --> 00:18:49.254 position:50% align:center
Stop it! What are you doing?

00:18:49.337 --> 00:18:52.924 position:50% align:center
Diminishing your power,
what else? The seal is broken.

00:18:53.008 --> 00:18:55.885 position:50% align:center
[VRITRA] The world would be
turned upside down!

00:18:55.969 --> 00:18:59.014 position:50% align:center
[SOU]
Precisely my intention!

00:19:00.098 --> 00:19:03.435 position:50% align:center
[VRITRA groans]

00:19:03.518 --> 00:19:05.353 position:50% align:center
[ALKA]
Vritra!

00:19:05.437 --> 00:19:08.440 position:50% align:center
[SOU laughs] With Kunlun's
Guardian destroyed,

00:19:08.523 --> 00:19:10.150 position:50% align:center
Alka is rendered helpless!

00:19:10.233 --> 00:19:12.569 position:50% align:center
All that's left for me
is to open the door!

00:19:12.652 --> 00:19:14.988 position:50% align:center
Murderer!

00:19:16.531 --> 00:19:18.491 position:50% align:center
Have a little dignity--

00:19:23.163 --> 00:19:25.206 position:50% align:center
I... I don't understand,

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:27.125 position:50% align:center
his strength
should have left you!

00:19:27.208 --> 00:19:29.127 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Good point.

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:31.671 position:50% align:center
[VRITRA] Whew.
Thought I was a goner!

00:19:31.755 --> 00:19:33.089 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Since when does it talk?

00:19:33.173 --> 00:19:34.257 position:50% align:center
[VRITRA]
Forgive me!

00:19:34.341 --> 00:19:36.593 position:50% align:center
I was compelled to
inhabit your accessory.

00:19:36.676 --> 00:19:38.803 position:50% align:center
I don't believe it!
You made a belt?

00:19:38.887 --> 00:19:41.681 position:50% align:center
And persuaded this young
lady to wear it in secret?

00:19:41.765 --> 00:19:43.308 position:50% align:center
I did? Oh, right!

00:19:43.391 --> 00:19:45.810 position:50% align:center
I made a really cool apron
out of Vritra's skin,

00:19:45.894 --> 00:19:48.605 position:50% align:center
but then I cut it up. Long
story, I was rolling pasta.

00:19:48.688 --> 00:19:50.732 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I said it was cursed
and sold it to some collector

00:19:50.815 --> 00:19:52.108 position:50% align:center
for a few bucks--

00:19:52.192 --> 00:19:54.069 position:50% align:center
[VRITRA] And I'm still
waiting for an apology,

00:19:54.152 --> 00:19:56.112 position:50% align:center
you bumbling, no-good idiot!

00:19:56.196 --> 00:19:58.656 position:50% align:center
This seems like a choice
moment to make my escape.

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:01.284 position:50% align:center
However, Kunlun's seal
will be broken,

00:20:01.368 --> 00:20:04.329 position:50% align:center
and I shall unveil
the final dungeon!

00:20:04.412 --> 00:20:06.998 position:50% align:center
[ALKA]
Coward! We're not done!

00:20:08.833 --> 00:20:11.628 position:50% align:center
Hold tight, everybody!
We're coming for you!

00:20:11.711 --> 00:20:12.837 position:50% align:center
Damn it.

00:20:12.921 --> 00:20:15.340 position:50% align:center
He's probably fine,
but I have to be sure!

00:20:15.423 --> 00:20:16.758 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:21.513 position:50% align:center
This is what I hoped
to avoid! Aw, man!

00:20:21.596 --> 00:20:24.307 position:50% align:center
What am I saying?
Snap out of it, Alan!

00:20:24.391 --> 00:20:25.892 position:50% align:center
Sir Lloyd wouldn't run.

00:20:25.975 --> 00:20:29.396 position:50% align:center
Now suck it up, grab your axe,
and show this thing who's boss!

00:20:29.479 --> 00:20:31.398 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Bring it on!

00:20:31.481 --> 00:20:34.984 position:50% align:center
I'll look amazing
in snakeskin brogues!

00:20:36.236 --> 00:20:39.614 position:50% align:center
Is he collapsing the dungeon
by sheer force of willpower?

00:20:39.698 --> 00:20:41.491 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER A] He'll take out
the monster in one move!

00:20:41.574 --> 00:20:42.742 position:50% align:center
[ALAN]
Do what now?

00:20:42.826 --> 00:20:44.452 position:50% align:center
[BOTH] You can do it, sir!
We believe in you!

00:20:44.536 --> 00:20:46.204 position:50% align:center
[ALAN]
What?!

00:20:46.287 --> 00:20:47.997 position:50% align:center
[ALKA]
Okay, what blithering idiot

00:20:48.081 --> 00:20:49.541 position:50% align:center
is trying to bury us alive?

00:20:49.624 --> 00:20:50.959 position:50% align:center
[MARIE]
I think you compromised

00:20:51.042 --> 00:20:52.752 position:50% align:center
the structure by
busting your way in.

00:20:52.836 --> 00:20:53.586 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS groan]

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:55.088 position:50% align:center
[ALKA whistles]

00:20:55.171 --> 00:20:57.340 position:50% align:center
[ALKA] Never mind.
I have an emergency exit.

00:20:57.424 --> 00:21:00.176 position:50% align:center
All aboard! You can
thank me on the other side!

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:01.720 position:50% align:center
You're the one
who made this mess!

00:21:01.803 --> 00:21:04.347 position:50% align:center
[RIHO]
Duly noted. Let's go!

00:21:13.106 --> 00:21:14.983 position:50% align:center
[KING]
Allan Toin Lidocaine.

00:21:15.066 --> 00:21:16.151 position:50% align:center
[ALAN]
Uh, you're Majesty?

00:21:16.234 --> 00:21:18.194 position:50% align:center
[KING] We commend your
triumphant return!

00:21:18.278 --> 00:21:21.197 position:50% align:center
Your unparalleled bravery in
the face of overwhelming odds

00:21:21.281 --> 00:21:22.907 position:50% align:center
has reduced the
dungeon to rubble

00:21:22.991 --> 00:21:26.077 position:50% align:center
and driven the foul serpent
from our domain!

00:21:26.161 --> 00:21:29.622 position:50% align:center
The kingdom is in your debt,
its people are at your service,

00:21:29.706 --> 00:21:32.125 position:50% align:center
and thus accolades
shall rain down upon you!

00:21:32.208 --> 00:21:34.085 position:50% align:center
That won't be necessary,
Your Majesty!

00:21:34.169 --> 00:21:35.545 position:50% align:center
I wasn't all that brave!

00:21:35.628 --> 00:21:39.174 position:50% align:center
Young man. Are you refusing me?
Rejecting praise?

00:21:39.257 --> 00:21:41.343 position:50% align:center
Such humility is
an example to us all!

00:21:41.426 --> 00:21:42.218 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow!

00:21:42.302 --> 00:21:44.471 position:50% align:center
I wanna be just like you!

00:21:44.554 --> 00:21:45.347 position:50% align:center
[KING]
Sir Alan!

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:46.348 position:50% align:center
Majesty!

00:21:46.431 --> 00:21:48.308 position:50% align:center
To honor your legendary deeds,

00:21:48.391 --> 00:21:52.187 position:50% align:center
I do hereby anoint you with
the title of Dragon Slayer!

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:55.398 position:50% align:center
[ALAN]
But I didn't slay a dragon!

00:22:01.988 --> 00:22:03.782 position:50% align:center
That guy...

00:22:05.283 --> 00:22:10.538 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD] Is he named after
the hero in my book, or--?

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:14.751 position:50% align:center
[MARIE]
Let's get this party started!

00:22:14.834 --> 00:22:16.628 position:50% align:center
[ALKA]
Just point me to the alcohol!

00:22:16.711 --> 00:22:18.004 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD]
Uh, hey, Chief!

00:22:18.088 --> 00:22:20.090 position:50% align:center
[RIHO] You are all about
popping up without warning.

00:22:20.173 --> 00:22:24.052 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Impressive, huh?
Bing bong!

00:22:24.135 --> 00:22:26.012 position:50% align:center
[SELEN gasps] Wha--?
What is the meaning of this?

00:22:26.096 --> 00:22:28.848 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you're coming with me
to Kunlun for a while.

00:22:28.932 --> 00:22:30.225 position:50% align:center
It'll be super fun!

00:22:30.308 --> 00:22:31.226 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:22:31.309 --> 00:22:32.852 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Huh...?

00:22:32.936 --> 00:22:35.814 position:50% align:center
What?!
