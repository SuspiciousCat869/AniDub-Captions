00:00:34.417 --> 00:00:35.792 align:middle
Right. Cool.

00:00:35.875 --> 00:00:38.208 align:middle
That just about does
it for orientation.

00:00:38.292 --> 00:00:40.542 align:middle
Are there any questions?

00:00:40.625 --> 00:00:42.500 align:middle
[SELEN]
Where could he possibly be?

00:00:42.583 --> 00:00:44.542 align:middle
[RIHO] Why would they flunk
someone as valuable as...

00:00:44.625 --> 00:00:46.000 align:middle
[RIHO, SELEN]
...Lloyd!

00:00:46.083 --> 00:00:48.708 align:middle
[RIHO] What the hell is
Merthophan playing at?

00:00:48.792 --> 00:00:50.875 align:middle
[MERTHOPHAN grunting]

00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:53.375 align:middle
[RIHO]
He doesn't even know!

00:00:53.458 --> 00:00:57.542 align:middle
Look at him! The man's got
no clue where Lloyd is!

00:00:57.625 --> 00:01:00.667 align:middle
All right then, moving on.
The floor is yours.

00:01:04.458 --> 00:01:06.833 align:middle
Yes. Commencing with roll call.

00:01:06.917 --> 00:01:10.083 align:middle
Anyone not present,
raise your hand!

00:01:10.167 --> 00:01:11.958 align:middle
For the love of god,
get ahold of yourself!

00:01:12.042 --> 00:01:14.083 align:middle
Quit yammering
and pass these out!

00:01:14.167 --> 00:01:17.667 align:middle
[MERTHOPHAN groaning]
Glad to.

00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.708 align:middle
[CHOLINE] As I'm sure
most of you are aware,

00:01:20.792 --> 00:01:22.042 align:middle
these are uncertain times.

00:01:22.125 --> 00:01:23.917 align:middle
The Kingdom of Azami
currently stands

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.750 align:middle
on the brink of war
with the Jiou Empire...

00:01:26.833 --> 00:01:28.417 align:middle
[MERTHOPHAN]
Uncertain times, my foot!

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.000 align:middle
Without Lloyd Belladonna,
we're screwed.

00:01:31.083 --> 00:01:34.875 align:middle
[RIHO] I was gonna retire on the
money I bilked off that kid!

00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.417 align:middle
[SELEN]
I need him. I need him.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.500 align:middle
I need him. I need him. I need
him. I need him. I need him.

00:01:38.583 --> 00:01:39.750 align:middle
And it gets worse.

00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:41.958 align:middle
As if the coming storm
weren't headache enough,

00:01:42.042 --> 00:01:45.333 align:middle
Princess Maria has been
missing for five years.

00:01:45.417 --> 00:01:46.958 align:middle
Where is he?

00:01:47.042 --> 00:01:49.042 align:middle
[RIHO]
This makes no sense.

00:01:49.125 --> 00:01:51.708 align:middle
[SELEN] I need him. I need him.
I need him. I need him.

00:01:51.792 --> 00:01:54.125 align:middle
[ALL]
I need him!

00:01:54.208 --> 00:01:56.583 align:middle
Here's the deal:
Anyone who recovers the Princess

00:01:56.667 --> 00:01:58.542 align:middle
will be given an instant
promotion with benefits,

00:01:58.625 --> 00:02:00.625 align:middle
a sizable cash reward,

00:02:00.708 --> 00:02:03.250 align:middle
and duly granted any
wish within reason.

00:02:03.333 --> 00:02:06.500 align:middle
[RIHO, SELEN gasp]
Are you serious?

00:03:46.417 --> 00:03:49.292 align:middle
The written portion was just as
hard as the one on martial arts,

00:03:49.375 --> 00:03:51.833 align:middle
so it's no surprise
I didn't make the cut.

00:03:51.917 --> 00:03:55.042 align:middle
[sighs] Still
disappointing, though.

00:03:57.083 --> 00:03:58.417 align:middle
Uh?

00:04:04.542 --> 00:04:06.375 align:middle
[LLOYD]
Could you not?

00:04:08.417 --> 00:04:10.042 align:middle
[LLOYD]
Huh.

00:04:12.292 --> 00:04:14.208 align:middle
[LLOYD]
This is the place.

00:04:16.292 --> 00:04:19.083 align:middle
Um, I'm sorry to bother you.

00:04:20.792 --> 00:04:22.417 align:middle
[LLOYD]
Anyone home?

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.292 align:middle
[CHROME]
Who goes there?

00:04:24.375 --> 00:04:25.292 align:middle
Huh?

00:04:25.375 --> 00:04:28.667 align:middle
[CHROME yells]

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.458 align:middle
[CHROME]
What the--?

00:04:30.542 --> 00:04:35.292 align:middle
Uh? Sorry. Right now is
clearly not a good time!

00:04:35.375 --> 00:04:36.625 align:middle
[CHROME gasps]

00:04:36.708 --> 00:04:40.083 align:middle
[CHROME] Who is this kid?
Better yet, what is he?

00:04:40.167 --> 00:04:41.583 align:middle
The sheer magnitude of his power

00:04:41.667 --> 00:04:45.292 align:middle
compelled me to
attack on instinct!

00:04:45.375 --> 00:04:48.208 align:middle
What's he after? Information?

00:04:48.292 --> 00:04:51.250 align:middle
Has he come to intimidate
a former royal guard?

00:04:51.333 --> 00:04:56.208 align:middle
I, uh, I just saw your poster
about part-time work!

00:04:56.292 --> 00:04:57.333 align:middle
Beg pardon?

00:04:57.417 --> 00:04:59.083 align:middle
I need a job.

00:04:59.167 --> 00:05:01.542 align:middle
[CHROME]
An obvious ruse.

00:05:01.625 --> 00:05:04.542 align:middle
Er, yes, provided you have
the right qualifications.

00:05:04.625 --> 00:05:06.250 align:middle
And relevant experience.

00:05:06.333 --> 00:05:09.583 align:middle
I know how to cook.
And I can clean.

00:05:09.667 --> 00:05:12.042 align:middle
What does that mean?
Perhaps a code?

00:05:12.125 --> 00:05:14.708 align:middle
The gang back home always
said I was a natural.

00:05:14.792 --> 00:05:17.750 align:middle
[CHROME]
He used to be part of a gang?

00:05:17.833 --> 00:05:21.625 align:middle
Yes, well, I'm sure you wouldn't
mind giving a demonstration.

00:05:21.708 --> 00:05:24.667 align:middle
Sure thing! I can hit the ground
running at a moment's notice!

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:30.083 align:middle
[CHROME] Can you now?
Let's see what you've got!

00:05:30.167 --> 00:05:31.792 align:middle
How 'bout a nice risotto?

00:05:31.875 --> 00:05:32.833 align:middle
Huh?

00:05:32.917 --> 00:05:35.083 align:middle
Just let me get
the lay of things.

00:05:35.167 --> 00:05:36.500 align:middle
[CHROME]
Eh?

00:05:40.167 --> 00:05:44.792 align:middle
[CHROME] He's actually making
risotto. Bizarre tactic.

00:05:44.875 --> 00:05:48.208 align:middle
Full disclosure, I came
here to join the military,

00:05:48.292 --> 00:05:49.833 align:middle
but I botched the exam.

00:05:49.917 --> 00:05:51.500 align:middle
[CHROME]
Sure you did.

00:05:51.583 --> 00:05:54.292 align:middle
[LLOYD] Thing is, my village
went all out for my going

00:05:54.375 --> 00:05:56.833 align:middle
away party. I'd feel
awful if I went back

00:05:56.917 --> 00:05:58.542 align:middle
empty-handed, y'know?

00:05:58.625 --> 00:06:01.708 align:middle
Figured I'd make myself
at home in the capital.

00:06:01.792 --> 00:06:05.625 align:middle
Try again. It's only a year.
I can hold out that long.

00:06:05.708 --> 00:06:08.500 align:middle
[CHROME] Hang on,
is he just a regular kid?

00:06:08.583 --> 00:06:12.625 align:middle
Impossible,
not with those reflexes.

00:06:12.708 --> 00:06:16.250 align:middle
No, this has to be an act.

00:06:17.542 --> 00:06:20.958 align:middle
[MERTHOPHAN]
Hm... He answered with--

00:06:21.042 --> 00:06:22.875 align:middle
[RIHO]
Doodles, yeah.

00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:27.958 align:middle
[SELEN] So? It's probably just
Sir Lloyd's idea of a joke!

00:06:28.042 --> 00:06:30.500 align:middle
Why are you so fixated?

00:06:30.583 --> 00:06:34.583 align:middle
Ugh. Sir Lloyd this, Sir Lloyd
that. What's with you three?

00:06:34.667 --> 00:06:36.000 align:middle
Perhaps he struggles to contain

00:06:36.083 --> 00:06:38.333 align:middle
the artistic genius
within his soul!

00:06:38.417 --> 00:06:41.583 align:middle
Forgive her, Colonel. Lights
are on, but no one's home.

00:06:41.667 --> 00:06:44.750 align:middle
Hold on a second,
is that his test? Ah!

00:06:44.833 --> 00:06:47.458 align:middle
Yeah. Seems he never
really had a prayer.

00:06:47.542 --> 00:06:49.667 align:middle
[CHOLINE]
Are you crazy?!

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:53.417 align:middle
These aren't doodles,
they're ancient runes!

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.542 align:middle
Is that good news or bad news?

00:06:55.625 --> 00:06:57.167 align:middle
It's chicken scratch.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:58.000 align:middle
Eh...?

00:06:58.083 --> 00:06:59.083 align:middle
[CHOLINE grunts]

00:06:59.167 --> 00:07:00.667 align:middle
[MERTHOPHAN groaning]

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:02.250 align:middle
How in the world
do you not know

00:07:02.333 --> 00:07:03.750 align:middle
ancient runes when you see them?

00:07:03.833 --> 00:07:06.167 align:middle
You're the one who told me
to brush up on the subject!

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:08.458 align:middle
"For the good of the kingdom,"
you said!

00:07:08.542 --> 00:07:10.250 align:middle
Huh. Oh, yeah.

00:07:10.333 --> 00:07:14.000 align:middle
So where is he? We need
to find this kid yesterday.

00:07:14.083 --> 00:07:15.250 align:middle
That's just it...

00:07:15.333 --> 00:07:17.792 align:middle
We have no idea where he is.

00:07:17.875 --> 00:07:19.208 align:middle
[LLOYD]
Sorry for the wait.

00:07:19.292 --> 00:07:22.250 align:middle
White fish risotto in
tomato basil sauce.

00:07:22.333 --> 00:07:25.708 align:middle
[CHROME] He did it.
He literally made risotto.

00:07:25.792 --> 00:07:27.708 align:middle
Do tomatoes not
agree with you, sir?

00:07:27.792 --> 00:07:29.792 align:middle
No, they're fine.
This looks delicious.

00:07:29.875 --> 00:07:31.833 align:middle
[LLOYD laughs]

00:07:31.917 --> 00:07:34.375 align:middle
[CHROME] I'm no fool.
He plans to strike me down

00:07:34.458 --> 00:07:37.125 align:middle
when I'm most vulnerable. Lunch!

00:07:38.333 --> 00:07:39.583 align:middle
[CHROME]
So be it.

00:07:39.667 --> 00:07:41.417 align:middle
As former head of
the royal guard,

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.792 align:middle
I have but one course of action.

00:07:45.417 --> 00:07:48.542 align:middle
[CHROME]
To accept his challenge!

00:07:49.833 --> 00:07:52.958 align:middle
Yeah, so, what exactly
are these things good for?

00:07:53.042 --> 00:07:55.958 align:middle
They have power
beyond imagining.

00:07:56.042 --> 00:07:58.083 align:middle
In the hands of an
accomplished caster,

00:07:58.167 --> 00:07:59.917 align:middle
someone really talented,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.833 align:middle
there's almost no limit
to what ancient runes can do.

00:08:03.917 --> 00:08:04.875 align:middle
--[SELEN] Whoa.
--[RIHO] Cool.

00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.333 align:middle
Is it too much to
hope you talked

00:08:06.417 --> 00:08:08.500 align:middle
with the admin who interviewed
our little prodigy?

00:08:08.583 --> 00:08:11.708 align:middle
Ah, well, as a matter of fact...

00:08:11.792 --> 00:08:13.000 align:middle
[yelps]

00:08:13.083 --> 00:08:15.042 align:middle
Hey, there. How you doin'?

00:08:15.125 --> 00:08:17.333 align:middle
I wonder if you might indulge me
with a few questions.

00:08:17.417 --> 00:08:19.000 align:middle
[INTERVIEWER A grunting]

00:08:19.083 --> 00:08:22.333 align:middle
This random flashback is
making me uncomfortable.

00:08:22.417 --> 00:08:24.167 align:middle
Apart from his written test...

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:26.292 align:middle
Well, it's a little suspicious,

00:08:26.375 --> 00:08:29.583 align:middle
but apparently Lloyd claimed
the ability to summon rain.

00:08:29.667 --> 00:08:31.625 align:middle
Sounds like an ambitious lie.

00:08:31.708 --> 00:08:34.417 align:middle
[CHOLINE] Not necessarily.
Think about it.

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:37.500 align:middle
Knowledge of ancient runes may
just be the tip of the iceberg.

00:08:37.583 --> 00:08:40.292 align:middle
Who knows what else
the kid is capable of?

00:08:40.375 --> 00:08:41.125 align:middle
[RIHO]
Whoa...

00:08:41.208 --> 00:08:42.500 align:middle
Amazing.

00:08:42.583 --> 00:08:44.917 align:middle
None of us knows
the first thing about Lloyd,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.875 align:middle
except that he may have powers
beyond all reckoning.

00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:54.625 align:middle
[CHROME] This might be the most
incredible meal I've ever eaten!

00:08:54.708 --> 00:08:56.708 align:middle
I used way too much
basil, didn't I?

00:08:56.792 --> 00:08:58.958 align:middle
No! Not at all!
It was delicious!

00:08:59.042 --> 00:09:00.667 align:middle
So you enjoyed it, then?

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:04.542 align:middle
[CHROME] Hm. Is he really
just here about the job?

00:09:04.625 --> 00:09:08.208 align:middle
Uh, so, my name is Chrome
Molybdenum, the proprietor.

00:09:08.292 --> 00:09:09.583 align:middle
Yourself?

00:09:09.667 --> 00:09:13.375 align:middle
Oh, I didn't say? Lloyd
Belladonna, at your service!

00:09:13.458 --> 00:09:16.667 align:middle
[CHROME] Well, he does need
the work, I guess,

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:19.458 align:middle
but I won't dare
leave him unattended.

00:09:19.542 --> 00:09:20.875 align:middle
[LLOYD gasping]

00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:24.083 align:middle
[CHROME] Welcome aboard, Lloyd.
Consider yourself hired.

00:09:24.167 --> 00:09:29.292 align:middle
Ha! You- You won't
regret it, sir! [laughs]

00:09:29.375 --> 00:09:31.625 align:middle
[CHOLINE] Man...
If we weren't so obsessed

00:09:31.708 --> 00:09:33.208 align:middle
with standardized testing,

00:09:33.292 --> 00:09:36.125 align:middle
Lloyd would be here right now
teaching me how to use runes.

00:09:36.208 --> 00:09:38.125 align:middle
[SELEN]
Worry not! We have a plan!

00:09:38.208 --> 00:09:40.500 align:middle
Indeed, Lloyd shall
attend this academy.

00:09:40.583 --> 00:09:42.083 align:middle
His enrollment will
be our reward

00:09:42.167 --> 00:09:44.333 align:middle
upon recovering the
vanished princess!

00:09:44.417 --> 00:09:46.875 align:middle
I'm fairly surprised by
how smart that sounds.

00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:50.917 align:middle
And of course the fat cash prize
is nothing to sneeze at, either.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.458 align:middle
[MARIE]
You failed the exam?!

00:09:53.542 --> 00:09:54.750 align:middle
Yeah...

00:09:54.833 --> 00:09:57.500 align:middle
[BOTH gasping]

00:09:57.583 --> 00:10:00.208 align:middle
Time to burn this
kingdom to ash.

00:10:00.292 --> 00:10:02.375 align:middle
That is not something
we joke about!

00:10:02.458 --> 00:10:06.208 align:middle
[ALKA] Oh lighten up, Little
Miss Sunshine! I wasn't joking.

00:10:06.292 --> 00:10:08.000 align:middle
I think you're missing
the point, Alka.

00:10:08.083 --> 00:10:09.458 align:middle
Am I really, though?

00:10:09.542 --> 00:10:10.708 align:middle
[MARIE squeaks]

00:10:10.792 --> 00:10:13.167 align:middle
Uh, Ma'am, if you please.

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:17.500 align:middle
I'd like to try again,
when they give it next year.

00:10:17.583 --> 00:10:19.875 align:middle
Yes! Meanwhile we can
head back home

00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:22.375 align:middle
so I can cuddle you like the
adorable puppers you are!

00:10:22.458 --> 00:10:24.750 align:middle
--[LLOYD] No thanks.
--Huh?!

00:10:24.833 --> 00:10:27.500 align:middle
If it's okay,
I'd like to stay here.

00:10:27.583 --> 00:10:30.792 align:middle
I'm sorry, Miss! If it's too
much to ask, just say no!

00:10:30.875 --> 00:10:32.292 align:middle
Huh?

00:10:32.375 --> 00:10:34.750 align:middle
So you don't want
to go with me?

00:10:34.833 --> 00:10:36.875 align:middle
I'm more than happy to pay rent.

00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:42.542 align:middle
I found a part-time job.
Please, Marie! I mean, ma'am!

00:10:42.625 --> 00:10:47.042 align:middle
Uh, I guess I'm fine with it,
if everyone else is.

00:10:47.125 --> 00:10:48.542 align:middle
[gasps]

00:10:51.708 --> 00:10:55.042 align:middle
I can't deny you.
You may do as you see fit.

00:10:55.125 --> 00:10:56.042 align:middle
Really?

00:10:56.125 --> 00:10:57.042 align:middle
[ALKA]
Yes.

00:10:57.125 --> 00:10:59.292 align:middle
Thank you so much!
Thanks, ma'am!

00:10:59.375 --> 00:11:00.917 align:middle
I-- I don't know
what else to say,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.500 align:middle
so I'll go make us
some dinner! [laughs]

00:11:05.583 --> 00:11:09.208 align:middle
I'm amazed you allowed that.
Your old age making you soft?

00:11:09.292 --> 00:11:13.583 align:middle
Ah, no one in her right mind
could say no to that face.

00:11:13.667 --> 00:11:16.625 align:middle
Goodness, it won't be easy
making myself at home here,

00:11:16.708 --> 00:11:19.042 align:middle
but I suppose I'll
manage for his sake.

00:11:19.125 --> 00:11:20.458 align:middle
[MARIE]
What?!

00:11:20.542 --> 00:11:22.583 align:middle
What if I turned the guest bed
into a double so I can

00:11:22.667 --> 00:11:28.167 align:middle
cradle him in my arms like a
baby as he drifts off to sleep?

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:30.750 align:middle
Forgive me, but with
all due respect, chief,

00:11:30.833 --> 00:11:36.292 align:middle
maybe your magic could
be put to better use?

00:11:36.375 --> 00:11:38.542 align:middle
Like saving this kingdom.

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:42.833 align:middle
Just how bad have
things gotten here?

00:11:42.917 --> 00:11:45.000 align:middle
Bad, and they're getting worse.

00:11:45.083 --> 00:11:48.208 align:middle
King Azami started advocating
for war five years ago.

00:11:48.292 --> 00:11:49.667 align:middle
I suspect the one responsible

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:51.167 align:middle
for putting the
idea into his head

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:55.125 align:middle
will officially declare war
at the Foundation Festival.

00:11:55.208 --> 00:11:56.125 align:middle
Ah...

00:11:56.208 --> 00:11:57.833 align:middle
The timing is pure theatre.

00:11:57.917 --> 00:11:59.417 align:middle
Once they receive invitations,

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:01.875 align:middle
foreign officials will flock
to the Festival in droves

00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.375 align:middle
from all over the realm.

00:12:03.458 --> 00:12:07.417 align:middle
So war with the Jiou Empire
is all but a certainty, huh.

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:08.750 align:middle
That's correct.

00:12:08.833 --> 00:12:12.833 align:middle
Unless this witch has
anything to say about it!

00:12:12.917 --> 00:12:16.167 align:middle
My dear. How often
must I tell you this?

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:18.083 align:middle
The villagers of Kunlun do not

00:12:18.167 --> 00:12:20.458 align:middle
intervene in affairs
of this nature.

00:12:20.542 --> 00:12:22.375 align:middle
We only concern
ourselves with threats

00:12:22.458 --> 00:12:26.208 align:middle
beyond human comprehension,
like demon lords.

00:12:26.292 --> 00:12:29.583 align:middle
The wounded pride of little
souls inevitably leads to war.

00:12:29.667 --> 00:12:31.792 align:middle
We can't get sucked
into petty squabbles.

00:12:31.875 --> 00:12:34.292 align:middle
What a waste of our
time that would be.

00:12:34.375 --> 00:12:37.250 align:middle
I understand. Why do you
think I risked my life

00:12:37.333 --> 00:12:40.208 align:middle
five years ago learning
the Disenchant Rune?

00:12:40.292 --> 00:12:43.167 align:middle
I knew the price of
your knowledge.

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:44.750 align:middle
Believe me,
I'm more than happy

00:12:44.833 --> 00:12:46.833 align:middle
to take matters
into my own hands.

00:12:46.917 --> 00:12:48.708 align:middle
I've been exploring
the capital lately

00:12:48.792 --> 00:12:51.583 align:middle
with the intention of flushing
the warmonger out.

00:12:51.667 --> 00:12:53.500 align:middle
I get where you're coming from,

00:12:53.583 --> 00:12:56.083 align:middle
and I'm not unsympathetic
to the cause.

00:12:56.167 --> 00:12:58.583 align:middle
But I've seen many a
noble intention fail,

00:12:58.667 --> 00:13:01.042 align:middle
all because they didn't
wait for their moment.

00:13:01.125 --> 00:13:03.917 align:middle
I appreciate that, I really do.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.875 align:middle
[ALKA]
Hm... I'm not convinced, Marie.

00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:10.083 align:middle
If you get Lloyd wrapped up
in all this I won't hesitate.

00:13:10.167 --> 00:13:12.458 align:middle
I'll spirit the boy back
to Kunlun so fast

00:13:12.542 --> 00:13:15.292 align:middle
your head will spin.

00:13:15.375 --> 00:13:17.458 align:middle
[MARIE]
Understood.

00:13:17.542 --> 00:13:19.833 align:middle
So, do what you gotta
do and move on.

00:13:19.917 --> 00:13:21.583 align:middle
See to it that Lloyd
gets himself enrolled

00:13:21.667 --> 00:13:24.167 align:middle
in the military
academy. Tick-tock!

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:27.625 align:middle
You say that like it's easy!
Why's his military career

00:13:27.708 --> 00:13:29.958 align:middle
so important to you
in the first place?

00:13:30.042 --> 00:13:31.917 align:middle
Um, none of your bees wax.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.750 align:middle
Let's just say I'm fulfilling
my deepest wish.

00:13:34.833 --> 00:13:36.917 align:middle
[MARIE] In other words,
it's just a whim.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.792 align:middle
Anyhoo, I best get back home

00:13:38.875 --> 00:13:41.500 align:middle
before the other villagers
start making a fuss.

00:13:41.583 --> 00:13:44.667 align:middle
Lloyd, hon!
I'll be back real soon!

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:46.208 align:middle
[LLOYD]
Bye!

00:13:47.792 --> 00:13:52.625 align:middle
[sighs] Hopefully by "soon," you
mean the opposite. Loli Hag.

00:13:52.708 --> 00:13:54.917 align:middle
[ALKA] Oh, I forgot!
I've arranged it so

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.708 align:middle
every time you make
a crack about my age

00:13:56.792 --> 00:13:59.208 align:middle
you'll be hit with
moderate bad luck.

00:13:59.292 --> 00:14:02.917 align:middle
Uh? That's not--

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.792 align:middle
[screaming] A Charlie horse
is moderate bad luck?

00:14:06.875 --> 00:14:12.167 align:middle
[groaning] That withered
old crone!

00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:14.417 align:middle
[MARIE screams]

00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:35.375 align:middle
[RIHO] I say we let Selen
worry about Lloyd.

00:14:35.458 --> 00:14:39.125 align:middle
Weird as it seems, they have
some sort of connection.

00:14:39.208 --> 00:14:40.167 align:middle
Seriously?

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:42.417 align:middle
[RIHO]
Mm-hm. I've seen it myself.

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:43.792 align:middle
According to her,
the two of them

00:14:43.875 --> 00:14:45.250 align:middle
are destined for each other.

00:14:45.333 --> 00:14:47.167 align:middle
She couldn't wait to
be done with her test.

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:49.667 align:middle
Had to run right out
and go find her man.

00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:50.917 align:middle
Fascinating.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.083 align:middle
Let her handle him,
you and I can focus

00:14:53.167 --> 00:14:55.417 align:middle
on finding the princess,
then you throw

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:59.625 align:middle
your weight around with
the brass to get him in.

00:14:59.708 --> 00:15:03.333 align:middle
With Lloyd on our side, this
nation can maintain peace.

00:15:03.417 --> 00:15:06.708 align:middle
He's our only hope at
avoiding all-out war.

00:15:06.792 --> 00:15:09.167 align:middle
Huh?

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:12.375 align:middle
Ah, that's rather unusual.
This place is packed.

00:15:12.458 --> 00:15:14.833 align:middle
[RIHO] Huh? What are you
talking about? It's lunchtime.

00:15:14.917 --> 00:15:16.875 align:middle
This is a cafeteria.

00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:19.792 align:middle
[MERTHOPHAN] Known for large
portions and rock bottom prices,

00:15:19.875 --> 00:15:21.917 align:middle
not the quality of its fare.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.583 align:middle
Cadets only dine here
when they've exhausted

00:15:23.667 --> 00:15:27.042 align:middle
all other possible options,
but normally it's deserted.

00:15:27.125 --> 00:15:28.500 align:middle
[RIHO grunting]

00:15:28.583 --> 00:15:30.875 align:middle
Also, the floors used
to be caked with grease.

00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:32.125 align:middle
Now they're clean.

00:15:32.208 --> 00:15:34.417 align:middle
More than that,
they're sparkling.

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:38.125 align:middle
[RIHO] You say that
like it's a bad thing.

00:15:38.208 --> 00:15:40.083 align:middle
Incidentally,
who's the meathead?

00:15:40.167 --> 00:15:43.000 align:middle
Humble barkeep? I think not.

00:15:43.083 --> 00:15:45.583 align:middle
Head of the Royal Guard.
Or used to be.

00:15:45.667 --> 00:15:47.583 align:middle
Former escort to the princess.

00:15:47.667 --> 00:15:49.708 align:middle
Fascinating.

00:15:49.792 --> 00:15:52.417 align:middle
[BOTH grunt]

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:53.917 align:middle
Shut up and eat.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.083 align:middle
[BOTH gasp]

00:15:55.167 --> 00:15:57.250 align:middle
[RIHO]
This looks amazing!

00:15:57.333 --> 00:15:58.958 align:middle
[MERTHOPHAN]
Yeah.

00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:08.292 align:middle
[MERTHOPHAN]
What's going on here, Chrome?!

00:16:08.375 --> 00:16:09.958 align:middle
Your food's never
been this edible!

00:16:10.042 --> 00:16:11.583 align:middle
I hired a new part-timer.

00:16:11.667 --> 00:16:12.833 align:middle
My ass!

00:16:12.917 --> 00:16:14.542 align:middle
No self-respecting member
of the labor force

00:16:14.625 --> 00:16:16.417 align:middle
would subject themselves
to this sinkhole!

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:18.083 align:middle
What idiot wants
to work for you?

00:16:18.167 --> 00:16:22.042 align:middle
[LLOYD] Order up!
One fluffy rice omelet!

00:16:23.458 --> 00:16:26.208 align:middle
Thank you, Lloyd. Now go
take out the garbage.

00:16:26.292 --> 00:16:28.125 align:middle
Right away, sir.

00:16:30.125 --> 00:16:34.458 align:middle
Explain yourself! How is
that boy your employee?

00:16:34.542 --> 00:16:38.083 align:middle
Wait a minute! How do you
even know who he is?!

00:16:38.167 --> 00:16:39.125 align:middle
I don't.

00:16:39.208 --> 00:16:40.833 align:middle
[CHROME grunts]

00:16:40.917 --> 00:16:43.750 align:middle
That said, I'm fairly familiar
with what he's capable of.

00:16:43.833 --> 00:16:46.292 align:middle
So I'm not paranoid!
That's good.

00:16:46.375 --> 00:16:49.833 align:middle
I've been walking on eggshells
just waiting for him to attack!

00:16:49.917 --> 00:16:51.750 align:middle
How the hell'd he end up here?

00:16:51.833 --> 00:16:54.583 align:middle
You let a specimen like that
slip through your fingers?

00:16:54.667 --> 00:16:58.708 align:middle
[LLOYD sighs]
Dang it. We've got bugs.

00:16:58.792 --> 00:17:01.500 align:middle
Shouldn't have let
the trash pile up.

00:17:03.542 --> 00:17:06.250 align:middle
Guess I'll take it
to the incinerator.

00:17:12.042 --> 00:17:13.292 align:middle
[LLOYD]
Hm?

00:17:16.042 --> 00:17:18.833 align:middle
[LLOYD]
Miss Marie? That's weird.

00:17:20.583 --> 00:17:22.833 align:middle
Could be out shopping
or something.

00:17:22.917 --> 00:17:24.292 align:middle
[STUDENT A]
Where they'd say the fight is?

00:17:24.375 --> 00:17:25.708 align:middle
[STUDENT B]
Just up ahead!

00:17:25.792 --> 00:17:26.833 align:middle
[STUDENT A] Please tell me
someone didn't smuggle in

00:17:26.917 --> 00:17:28.292 align:middle
another monster.

00:17:28.375 --> 00:17:31.000 align:middle
[STUDENT B] Right? This is
starting to get out of hand!

00:17:36.125 --> 00:17:38.417 align:middle
[ALAN]
That does it! Enough!

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:41.458 align:middle
You're jeopardizing the
reputation of fellow cadets!

00:17:41.542 --> 00:17:43.333 align:middle
I won't stand for it!

00:17:43.417 --> 00:17:45.667 align:middle
The classmate you're
defending is a rake!

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:48.000 align:middle
When asked if he knew the
whereabouts of Sir Lloyd,

00:17:48.083 --> 00:17:51.417 align:middle
he insisted I follow him only to
shamelessly make a pass at me!

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:53.708 align:middle
Thus, I decided to make
an example,

00:17:53.792 --> 00:17:56.167 align:middle
and yank out his chest hair.

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:58.667 align:middle
Ah! It burns like fire!

00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:01.542 align:middle
You don't just deprive
a man of his front rug!

00:18:01.625 --> 00:18:03.792 align:middle
You are the scion of
a noble bloodline,

00:18:03.875 --> 00:18:06.667 align:middle
which means everything
you do reflects upon me!

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:07.833 align:middle
[SELEN]
Hmph.

00:18:09.667 --> 00:18:12.542 align:middle
[ALAN] And if you refuse
to be reasoned with...

00:18:12.625 --> 00:18:14.375 align:middle
I'd be honored to
persuade you,

00:18:14.458 --> 00:18:19.625 align:middle
by much older means!
Unsheathe your weapon!

00:18:19.708 --> 00:18:21.583 align:middle
[SELEN]
I accept your challenge.

00:18:21.667 --> 00:18:25.500 align:middle
Be warned, I too am skilled
in the persuasive arts.

00:18:25.583 --> 00:18:28.208 align:middle
Upon my search,
no man shall impinge!

00:18:28.292 --> 00:18:31.792 align:middle
Let those foolhardy enough
feel the cold steel--

00:18:33.167 --> 00:18:34.417 align:middle
Heh.

00:18:35.583 --> 00:18:36.625 align:middle
[SELEN]
So fast!

00:18:36.708 --> 00:18:40.292 align:middle
[ALAN yelling]

00:18:45.417 --> 00:18:46.542 align:middle
[BOTH gasp]

00:18:46.625 --> 00:18:48.333 align:middle
[ALL gasping]

00:18:54.875 --> 00:18:57.417 align:middle
What the--? That's her belt!

00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:02.750 align:middle
Huh... It's a sign.

00:19:02.833 --> 00:19:05.333 align:middle
I've been given
Sir Lloyd's blessing!

00:19:05.417 --> 00:19:06.625 align:middle
[ALL]
Eh?

00:19:06.708 --> 00:19:08.917 align:middle
Our lives are entwined
by the threads of fate!

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000 align:middle
This is a clear manifestation
of our shared destiny!

00:19:12.083 --> 00:19:13.667 align:middle
[LLOYD]
Um, excuse me?

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:14.917 align:middle
Could it be?

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.458 align:middle
[LLOYD]
Sorry to intrude.

00:19:16.542 --> 00:19:18.542 align:middle
I heard there was a monster
over here somewhere?

00:19:18.625 --> 00:19:21.375 align:middle
--[SELEN] Sir Lloyd!
--Huh? Miss Selen?

00:19:21.458 --> 00:19:22.750 align:middle
Eh?

00:19:26.417 --> 00:19:27.875 align:middle
Oh, Sir Lloyd!

00:19:27.958 --> 00:19:29.375 align:middle
I knew in my heart of hearts
that we'd meet again one day!

00:19:29.458 --> 00:19:31.375 align:middle
And miracle of miracles,
you appear in my hour of need

00:19:31.458 --> 00:19:32.750 align:middle
to snatch me from the
jaws of certain death

00:19:32.833 --> 00:19:34.208 align:middle
like a knight in shining armor!

00:19:34.292 --> 00:19:37.250 align:middle
This is destiny.
Destiny times two!

00:19:37.333 --> 00:19:40.208 align:middle
[LLOYD]
Um, what exactly is going on?

00:19:40.292 --> 00:19:42.750 align:middle
This is the guy she's
been up in arms about?

00:19:42.833 --> 00:19:45.000 align:middle
[CHOLINE]
What is the meaning of this?

00:19:45.083 --> 00:19:48.292 align:middle
Our cadets do not fight
amongst themselves!

00:19:48.375 --> 00:19:49.625 align:middle
[MERTHOPHAN]
What seems to be the problem?

00:19:49.708 --> 00:19:50.792 align:middle
[CHOLINE]
I just said.

00:19:50.875 --> 00:19:51.833 align:middle
[GROUP gasping]

00:19:51.917 --> 00:19:52.875 align:middle
There he is!

00:19:52.958 --> 00:19:54.667 align:middle
Guess she wasn't
playing around, huh?

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:56.333 align:middle
Selen actually found her man.

00:19:56.417 --> 00:19:57.958 align:middle
Isn't it just wonderful?

00:19:58.042 --> 00:20:00.125 align:middle
Lloyd has agreed
to defend my honor

00:20:00.208 --> 00:20:04.583 align:middle
by thrashing this self-important
thug within an inch of his life!

00:20:04.667 --> 00:20:05.708 align:middle
Uhh...

00:20:05.792 --> 00:20:07.375 align:middle
Can she be serious?

00:20:07.458 --> 00:20:10.083 align:middle
You're actually going
one on one with Lloyd?

00:20:10.167 --> 00:20:11.375 align:middle
Negative, Colonel!

00:20:11.458 --> 00:20:13.625 align:middle
As a part of the military,
albeit of low rank,

00:20:13.708 --> 00:20:15.500 align:middle
I am forbidden from
pummeling a civilian.

00:20:15.583 --> 00:20:17.333 align:middle
Shut your face!

00:20:17.417 --> 00:20:19.333 align:middle
Are you that much a
stickler for the rules,

00:20:19.417 --> 00:20:21.500 align:middle
or are you just afraid of
getting your ass kicked?

00:20:21.583 --> 00:20:23.500 align:middle
[ALAN screams]

00:20:23.583 --> 00:20:25.833 align:middle
Since when does Merthophan
advocate dueling?

00:20:25.917 --> 00:20:27.417 align:middle
"A soldier must
never raise a hand

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:29.125 align:middle
to those they've
sworn to protect."

00:20:29.208 --> 00:20:31.583 align:middle
That's you, by the way.
That's my impression of you.

00:20:31.667 --> 00:20:33.500 align:middle
Just keep quiet and
follow my lead.

00:20:33.583 --> 00:20:35.083 align:middle
Do you want Lloyd
enrolled or not?

00:20:35.167 --> 00:20:38.042 align:middle
[gasps] And... En guard!

00:20:38.125 --> 00:20:41.542 align:middle
[gasps] Why are you
two making me do this?

00:20:41.625 --> 00:20:44.042 align:middle
[ALAN gasps]
Of course!

00:20:44.125 --> 00:20:46.417 align:middle
I'm a Lidocaine!
A born warrior!

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:47.750 align:middle
It's only natural they'd want

00:20:47.833 --> 00:20:50.625 align:middle
to see my legendary battle
prowess put to the test!

00:20:50.708 --> 00:20:53.333 align:middle
Nothing personal, but I'm
totally fighting you.

00:20:53.417 --> 00:20:55.708 align:middle
Uh. But I'm just a weakling.

00:20:55.792 --> 00:20:57.708 align:middle
[ALAN] Sure, sure. Look,
kid, I have ambitions.

00:20:57.792 --> 00:20:59.250 align:middle
Work with me here!

00:20:59.333 --> 00:21:01.792 align:middle
Whoa! Okay, whatever! We'll
fight. Just please calm down!

00:21:01.875 --> 00:21:04.917 align:middle
[laughs] I won't forget
this kindness!

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.042 align:middle
Okay, uh,
so just humor me here.

00:21:07.125 --> 00:21:08.750 align:middle
What are the actual odds of Alan

00:21:08.833 --> 00:21:10.792 align:middle
surviving this friendly
little head-to-head?

00:21:10.875 --> 00:21:13.208 align:middle
Ah. Well, he's known
far and wide for his

00:21:13.292 --> 00:21:16.125 align:middle
considerable strength. As long
as he avoids letting Lloyd

00:21:16.208 --> 00:21:19.250 align:middle
punch him square in the
face, he should be fine.

00:21:19.333 --> 00:21:20.708 align:middle
[ALAN]
Fair is fair.

00:21:20.792 --> 00:21:22.542 align:middle
Since I outclass you, I'll
let you take the first shot.

00:21:22.625 --> 00:21:24.042 align:middle
[BOTH gasp]

00:21:24.125 --> 00:21:26.000 align:middle
You see, I'm widely known for
my considerable strength,

00:21:26.083 --> 00:21:28.917 align:middle
so if you like, feel free to
punch me square in the face.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.958 align:middle
Oh. Um, 'kay. I'll do my best.

00:21:32.042 --> 00:21:34.292 align:middle
[BOTH]
Uhh...

00:21:34.375 --> 00:21:35.875 align:middle
[ALAN chuckles]

00:21:35.958 --> 00:21:37.000 align:middle
[LLOYD grunts]

00:21:40.792 --> 00:21:42.375 align:middle
Right.

00:21:42.458 --> 00:21:44.500 align:middle
Mr. Merthophan?

00:21:44.583 --> 00:21:46.667 align:middle
I know. He's dead.

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:48.917 align:middle
Don't just stand there!
Say something!

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.083 align:middle
[LLOYD]
Hope you're ready!

00:21:51.167 --> 00:21:53.750 align:middle
[ALL]
He's not ready!

00:22:00.208 --> 00:22:01.750 align:middle
[BOTH gasp]

00:22:03.375 --> 00:22:06.375 align:middle
[ALL grunting]

00:22:06.458 --> 00:22:08.875 align:middle
What the hell?
This is wind magic!

00:22:08.958 --> 00:22:10.250 align:middle
[CHROME grunts]

00:22:11.667 --> 00:22:12.875 align:middle
[gasps]

00:22:15.042 --> 00:22:16.042 align:middle
[ALL gasp]

00:22:16.125 --> 00:22:18.125 align:middle
Oh, no! Sir Lloyd has vanished!

00:22:18.208 --> 00:22:19.875 align:middle
He did what?

00:22:22.875 --> 00:22:24.542 align:middle
[CHROME]
Was that...?

00:22:26.917 --> 00:22:29.708 align:middle
Huh? Uh...

00:22:32.083 --> 00:22:33.833 align:middle
[LLOYD]
Miss Marie?
