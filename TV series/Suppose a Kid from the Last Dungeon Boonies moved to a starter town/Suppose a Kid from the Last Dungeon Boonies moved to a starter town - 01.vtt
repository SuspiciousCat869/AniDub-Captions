Lloyd!

Gramps is waiting for us.
We should head back.

00:01:56.533 --> 00:01:58.284 position:50% align:center
Okay!

00:02:00.203 --> 00:02:03.498 position:50% align:center
So is living out here
as awesome as it looks?

strike out on his own.

Uh-huh!

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.963 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, I've been working
extra hard so you can.

00:02:10.046 --> 00:02:10.797 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.842 position:50% align:center
[grunts] Oh, yeah.

00:02:13.925 --> 00:02:16.344 position:50% align:center
Almost forgot. For you!

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:26.354 position:50% align:center
Wow! You're the best big
brother ever! [laughs]

00:02:26.438 --> 00:02:29.065 position:50% align:center
What'cha waiting for,
slow poke? Come on!

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:30.942 position:50% align:center

Right behind you!

[gasps]

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.812 position:50% align:center
Hi there, sorry to bother you.

00:03:17.072 --> 00:03:24.621 position:50% align:center
You're, um, the Witch of the
East Side? I mean, Marie, right?

00:03:27.832 --> 00:03:29.250 position:50% align:center
Sorry! I've come here to--

00:03:29.334 --> 00:03:31.920 position:50% align:center
[MARIE] Your heart's desire
is child's play to a witch,

00:03:32.003 --> 00:03:35.590 position:50% align:center
but not free. Unless you come
prepared to make a sacrifice,

00:03:35.674 --> 00:03:37.300 position:50% align:center
I suggest you be on your way.

00:03:37.384 --> 00:03:38.885 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.600 position:50% align:center
[MARIE] You understand the cost
of getting what you want, then?

00:03:45.684 --> 00:03:48.269 position:50% align:center
So be it.

00:03:48.353 --> 00:03:50.105 position:50% align:center
For what purpose are
you willing to pay

00:03:50.188 --> 00:03:53.149 position:50% align:center
the unthinkable ransom required?

00:03:56.861 --> 00:03:59.614 position:50% align:center
Well... My name is
Lloyd Belladonna,

00:03:59.698 --> 00:04:01.074 position:50% align:center
and I've traveled here
from the countryside

00:04:01.157 --> 00:04:02.742 position:50% align:center
in hopes of becoming
a soldier, ma'am!

00:04:02.826 --> 00:04:06.246 position:50% align:center
Also, I've come to be your ward!

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:07.789 position:50% align:center
Hm?

00:04:11.418 --> 00:04:12.919 position:50% align:center
[MARIE] Your heart's desire
is child's play to a--

00:04:13.003 --> 00:04:15.672 position:50% align:center
Yeah, we've kinda been
through that part already.

00:04:15.755 --> 00:04:18.091 position:50% align:center
If I'm so predictable, you can
"journey" to the nearest inn

00:04:18.174 --> 00:04:19.801 position:50% align:center
and take your chances there!

00:04:19.884 --> 00:04:21.720 position:50% align:center
Ugh, bad enough these yokels

00:04:21.803 --> 00:04:23.847 position:50% align:center
think I'm a glorified
serving wench.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.683 position:50% align:center
What backwater hellhole did
you say you were from again?

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:29.310 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD] Uh, I didn't.
It's called Kunlun.

00:04:29.394 --> 00:04:31.646 position:50% align:center
Well now, when you crawl
back tell them witches

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.025 position:50% align:center
aren't to be trifled with,
that your heart's desire--

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:37.736 position:50% align:center
Wait a minute.

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:39.237 position:50% align:center
What's the name of
your village chief?

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.240 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD]
Huh? Alka.

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:48.538 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, that reminds me.
I'm supposed to show you this.

00:04:48.621 --> 00:04:50.165 position:50% align:center
You did not just
bring that crystal

00:04:50.248 --> 00:04:52.709 position:50% align:center
nonchalantly into my house!

00:04:54.044 --> 00:04:55.170 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:55.253 --> 00:04:56.796 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD]
Ahh...

00:05:05.722 --> 00:05:10.518 position:50% align:center
Ha... Hey, sweetheart!
Long time no see!

00:05:10.602 --> 00:05:12.604 position:50% align:center
Surely you haven't
forgotten your master.

00:05:12.687 --> 00:05:14.022 position:50% align:center
Does Alka ring a bell?

00:05:14.105 --> 00:05:15.857 position:50% align:center
[MARIE]
Ugh...

00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:18.401 position:50% align:center
[ALKA]
Anywho, that's the lowdown.

00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:19.944 position:50% align:center
Take good care
of Lloyd, darling.

00:05:20.028 --> 00:05:21.946 position:50% align:center
He's simply too
precious for words.

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.616 position:50% align:center
You realize this means I'm
counting on you, right?

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:27.160 position:50% align:center
As you decree,
so shall it be done.

00:05:27.243 --> 00:05:30.955 position:50% align:center
Also, if I might trouble master
with a teensy little question.

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:32.916 position:50% align:center
Oh, by the way, I
should mention this

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:36.252 position:50% align:center
is all a prerecorded message.
So if you have any questions,

00:05:36.336 --> 00:05:38.046 position:50% align:center
you're out of luck.
Sorry, Marie.

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:39.589 position:50% align:center
You waltz in here
like you own the place

00:05:39.673 --> 00:05:40.965 position:50% align:center
and scare me half to
death with a rerun?

00:05:41.049 --> 00:05:42.050 position:50% align:center
You slack-jawed...

00:05:42.133 --> 00:05:45.428 position:50% align:center
[ALKA]
Just kidding, it's in real time.

00:05:45.512 --> 00:05:47.847 position:50% align:center
Hm. How often do I
have to grill you about

00:05:47.931 --> 00:05:49.849 position:50% align:center
not letting your
guard down so easily?

00:05:49.933 --> 00:05:51.267 position:50% align:center
Ugh...

00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:54.979 position:50% align:center
So, there's that. Lloyd,
my dear, if you ever get lonely,

00:05:55.063 --> 00:05:59.150 position:50% align:center
feel free to pop by for
a snuggle. 'Kay now bye!

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:08.910 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:06:13.456 --> 00:06:17.919 position:50% align:center
That lousy hag!

00:06:18.003 --> 00:06:20.130 position:50% align:center
I finally break free of your
loli-grandma shenanigans

00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:23.591 position:50% align:center
and out of nowhere you hit me
with this? Dress your age!

00:06:23.675 --> 00:06:25.802 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:06:25.885 --> 00:06:30.807 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, I didn't realize
she was gonna upset you.

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:34.811 position:50% align:center
That's okay, it's not your fault
she and I have a history.

00:06:34.894 --> 00:06:37.313 position:50% align:center
So then, you said
your name is Lloyd?

00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:38.648 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD]
Yes, ma'am!

00:06:38.732 --> 00:06:40.859 position:50% align:center
Suppose I'm stuck with you,
least till it's time

00:06:40.942 --> 00:06:43.319 position:50% align:center
for you to have a crack
at the entrance exam.

00:06:43.403 --> 00:06:45.572 position:50% align:center
I assume sleeping in the
backroom will suffice?

00:06:45.655 --> 00:06:50.160 position:50% align:center
I'm sure it'll be perfect,
thanks! Ha, ha!

00:06:50.243 --> 00:06:52.162 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:55.874 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD] Um-- I'm looking
forward to our time together.

00:06:55.957 --> 00:06:58.001 position:50% align:center
You seem nice!

00:07:00.628 --> 00:07:03.465 position:50% align:center
[MARIE] Decent enough li'l fella
once you give him a chance.

00:07:03.548 --> 00:07:05.884 position:50% align:center
Too bad he's connected
with the harpy.

00:07:05.967 --> 00:07:07.677 position:50% align:center
[ALKA]
Hands to yourself.

00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:10.430 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:07:10.513 --> 00:07:12.265 position:50% align:center
Give him so much
as a sideways glance

00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:13.767 position:50% align:center
and I'll turn you into a frog.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.186 position:50% align:center
[whimpering] How--?!
How are you here?

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:17.729 position:50% align:center
Teleportation.

00:07:17.812 --> 00:07:19.647 position:50% align:center
This crystal doubles
as a gateway.

00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:20.899 position:50% align:center
[MARIE]
You can't just go around

00:07:20.982 --> 00:07:23.485 position:50% align:center
using magic like it's
an everyday thing!

00:07:23.568 --> 00:07:26.154 position:50% align:center
Yeah, as you can see,
Lloyd Belladonna

00:07:26.237 --> 00:07:28.740 position:50% align:center
is almost impossibly pure
in his innocence.

00:07:28.823 --> 00:07:30.992 position:50% align:center
Calling him angel would
be an understatement.

00:07:31.076 --> 00:07:33.244 position:50% align:center
No funny stuff between
you two, got it?

00:07:33.328 --> 00:07:36.081 position:50% align:center
Not going to be an issue.

00:07:36.164 --> 00:07:38.541 position:50% align:center
And, so we're clear,
I totally picked up

00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:41.336 position:50% align:center
on the loli-grandma
comment earlier.

00:07:41.419 --> 00:07:43.630 position:50% align:center
I think the Curse of
Repeated Small Misfortunes

00:07:43.713 --> 00:07:46.883 position:50% align:center
is in order, don't you agree?
I love ancient rune magic.

00:07:46.966 --> 00:07:49.302 position:50% align:center
[MARIE] Kind of extreme
if you ask me--

00:07:52.847 --> 00:07:55.433 position:50% align:center
[MARIE]
I do not need this!

00:07:55.517 --> 00:07:57.268 position:50% align:center
She's playing with fire!

00:07:57.352 --> 00:07:59.521 position:50% align:center
Runes come from an
ancient civilization!

00:07:59.604 --> 00:08:02.732 position:50% align:center
One wrong move and the whole
world could be destroyed!

00:08:02.816 --> 00:08:05.860 position:50% align:center
Decimated! You don't
use them for something

00:08:05.944 --> 00:08:09.489 position:50% align:center
as petty as The Curse of
Repeated Small Misfortunes--

00:08:11.866 --> 00:08:15.245 position:50% align:center
[MARIE]
Harpy!

00:08:18.915 --> 00:08:21.126 position:50% align:center
[MARIE grunting]

00:08:26.423 --> 00:08:28.758 position:50% align:center
Where did this...?

00:08:28.842 --> 00:08:30.010 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD]
Good morning.

00:08:30.093 --> 00:08:32.262 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, sure, uh--

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.390 position:50% align:center
Hope you don't mind!

00:08:35.473 --> 00:08:37.684 position:50% align:center
I sorta made myself at
home in your kitchen.

00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:40.186 position:50% align:center
Well, I don't see a problem.

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:42.022 position:50% align:center
I tried to make some
breakfast for you,

00:08:42.105 --> 00:08:45.066 position:50% align:center
but it didn't quite
turn out the way I wanted.

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:48.611 position:50% align:center
Nothing special, but it should
get you through to lunch.

00:08:48.695 --> 00:08:51.406 position:50% align:center
Oh, gosh, I knew it. You don't
like pancakes, do you?

00:08:51.489 --> 00:08:53.241 position:50% align:center
[MARIE]
Are you kidding?

00:08:53.324 --> 00:08:57.120 position:50% align:center
If I could, I'd eat
pancakes for every meal!

00:08:57.203 --> 00:08:58.580 position:50% align:center
So good!

00:08:58.663 --> 00:09:00.540 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:09:01.499 --> 00:09:03.293 position:50% align:center
[MARIE]
Not to sound rude, but...

00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:05.920 position:50% align:center
You actually intend to try
and join the military?

00:09:06.004 --> 00:09:08.506 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I know. Dumb idea, right?

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:11.968 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Hey! I didn't mean
it like that, I just--

00:09:12.052 --> 00:09:14.596 position:50% align:center
It's fine, I have
to be realistic.

00:09:14.679 --> 00:09:16.264 position:50% align:center
[MARIE]
Hey, now--

00:09:16.348 --> 00:09:19.559 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD] Seriously,
I'm the runt of my village.

00:09:19.642 --> 00:09:22.395 position:50% align:center
I can't gather wood.
I can't fish.

00:09:22.479 --> 00:09:24.898 position:50% align:center
The one time I sparred
with my older brother,

00:09:24.981 --> 00:09:28.568 position:50% align:center
I was out of commission
the whole day.

00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:31.905 position:50% align:center
But... There's this
person I look up to,

00:09:31.988 --> 00:09:35.200 position:50% align:center
a real true-to-life hero.
Their adventures are even

00:09:35.283 --> 00:09:38.119 position:50% align:center
the basis of a
popular book series!

00:09:38.203 --> 00:09:39.954 position:50% align:center
A warrior whose stony demeanor

00:09:40.038 --> 00:09:43.833 position:50% align:center
in the face of death
is an inspiration.

00:09:43.917 --> 00:09:45.794 position:50% align:center
That's why you want to do this?

00:09:45.877 --> 00:09:48.213 position:50% align:center
I have to give it my best,
and if my best

00:09:48.296 --> 00:09:51.007 position:50% align:center
isn't good enough,
then at least I gave it a shot.

00:09:51.091 --> 00:09:52.175 position:50% align:center
Do you know what acceptance

00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:54.511 position:50% align:center
into Azami's military
academy calls for?

00:09:54.594 --> 00:09:56.554 position:50% align:center
Let's see, there's
a combat test,

00:09:56.638 --> 00:09:57.806 position:50% align:center
a written section on magic,

00:09:57.889 --> 00:10:00.475 position:50% align:center
and some kind of
interview process, I think?

00:10:00.558 --> 00:10:02.977 position:50% align:center
Exactly, and as you might guess,

00:10:03.061 --> 00:10:05.063 position:50% align:center
the part involving
combat is key.

00:10:05.146 --> 00:10:08.191 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'll have my
work cut out for me.

00:10:08.274 --> 00:10:12.570 position:50% align:center
To be honest, my stamina
makes fighting kind of an issue.

00:10:12.654 --> 00:10:16.533 position:50% align:center
I'm ashamed to admit it,
but this trip took six days.

00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:20.203 position:50% align:center
Given how far Kunlun is from
Azami that isn't so bad.

00:10:20.286 --> 00:10:22.789 position:50% align:center
Especially by train, you
must've really lucked out

00:10:22.872 --> 00:10:24.374 position:50% align:center
on the transfers.

00:10:24.457 --> 00:10:27.752 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD] Huh?
Oh, I didn't use any. I ran!

00:10:27.836 --> 00:10:30.505 position:50% align:center
[MARIE] You did what?!
Are you serious?!

00:10:30.588 --> 00:10:33.550 position:50% align:center
I know. Under normal
circumstances,

00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:35.343 position:50% align:center
I'd have gotten here
in half the time.

00:10:35.427 --> 00:10:38.221 position:50% align:center
Okay, just so you know,
that's incredible stamina!

00:10:38.304 --> 00:10:40.098 position:50% align:center
Not by my grandfather's
standards.

00:10:40.181 --> 00:10:42.183 position:50% align:center
He'd have made it in two days.

00:10:42.267 --> 00:10:44.519 position:50% align:center
Quick question for you,
if I may be so bold.

00:10:44.602 --> 00:10:45.770 position:50% align:center
Yes, ma'am?

00:10:45.854 --> 00:10:47.522 position:50% align:center
You didn't happen to run
afoul of any monsters

00:10:47.605 --> 00:10:49.190 position:50% align:center
on the way to Azami, did you?

00:10:49.274 --> 00:10:51.359 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD] Nah, no monsters,
which struck me as weird

00:10:51.443 --> 00:10:54.154 position:50% align:center
considering all the
warnings about travel.

00:10:54.237 --> 00:10:55.697 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:58.033 position:50% align:center
I stumbled across a few wild
animals along the way, though.

00:10:58.116 --> 00:11:00.785 position:50% align:center
Giant locusts.
Fire-breathing lizards!

00:11:00.869 --> 00:11:03.204 position:50% align:center
Wait! Those don't fit
your definition of monster?

00:11:03.288 --> 00:11:06.041 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD laughs] Come on,
even I know the difference

00:11:06.124 --> 00:11:08.835 position:50% align:center
between a wild animal
and a real monster.

00:11:08.918 --> 00:11:13.214 position:50% align:center
Monsters always talk a certain
way--"Tremble before me!"--

00:11:13.298 --> 00:11:14.674 position:50% align:center
and scary stuff like that.

00:11:14.758 --> 00:11:17.719 position:50% align:center
[MARIE] Those are demon lords!
And that's hot coffee!

00:11:17.802 --> 00:11:20.263 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD] Careful, Miss Marie!
You'll burn yourself!

00:11:20.347 --> 00:11:25.393 position:50% align:center
This is crazy. You have zero
concept of your own strength.

00:11:25.477 --> 00:11:27.395 position:50% align:center
That's very nice of you.

00:11:27.479 --> 00:11:30.148 position:50% align:center
But I have to be objective
about my self-improvement.

00:11:30.231 --> 00:11:32.650 position:50% align:center
You're also
ridiculously insecure.

00:11:32.734 --> 00:11:34.986 position:50% align:center
Uh. Wait a minute,
why does my skin

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:37.489 position:50% align:center
feel so much smoother
all of a sudden?

00:11:37.572 --> 00:11:40.867 position:50% align:center
[gasping] And my complexion
is breathtaking!

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:42.035 position:50% align:center
Every blemish has been erased,

00:11:42.118 --> 00:11:44.245 position:50% align:center
every wrinkle banished
from existence!

00:11:44.329 --> 00:11:47.624 position:50% align:center
Huh? That's probably
because I used this!

00:11:47.707 --> 00:11:50.043 position:50% align:center
[MARIE] What's it called, and
where can I buy it in bulk?

00:11:50.126 --> 00:11:52.879 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD] It's just
an upgraded handkerchief.

00:11:52.962 --> 00:11:54.756 position:50% align:center
So it's like a homemade remedy?

00:11:54.839 --> 00:11:57.717 position:50% align:center
That's one way of lookin' at it.

00:11:57.801 --> 00:12:01.221 position:50% align:center
It's simple, all I do is apply
this handy ancient rune,

00:12:01.304 --> 00:12:07.227 position:50% align:center
and even the toughest stains
are a thing of the past!

00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:09.354 position:50% align:center
[MARIE]
That is not a homemade remedy!

00:12:09.437 --> 00:12:12.190 position:50% align:center
That's the "Disenchant" rune,
and it doesn't remove stains,

00:12:12.273 --> 00:12:13.775 position:50% align:center
it removes curses.

00:12:13.858 --> 00:12:16.361 position:50% align:center
I spent three years of my life
trying to master the damn thing!

00:12:16.444 --> 00:12:17.987 position:50% align:center
What is my life?

00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:19.948 position:50% align:center
You're right,
it's nothing special.

00:12:20.031 --> 00:12:22.492 position:50% align:center
I shouldn't get excited over
something so basic.

00:12:22.575 --> 00:12:24.703 position:50% align:center
My mistake.

00:12:24.786 --> 00:12:27.122 position:50% align:center
It just seemed more impressive
than my other thing.

00:12:27.205 --> 00:12:29.416 position:50% align:center
Y'know, the ability
to summon rain at will.

00:12:29.499 --> 00:12:31.292 position:50% align:center
For the record, Lloyd,
that's not something

00:12:31.376 --> 00:12:33.461 position:50% align:center
just anyone can do!

00:12:36.006 --> 00:12:38.216 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD]
Miss Marie! Are you all right?

00:12:38.299 --> 00:12:39.801 position:50% align:center
[MARIE]
Here's the plan.

00:12:39.884 --> 00:12:40.885 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:12:40.969 --> 00:12:42.721 position:50% align:center
[MARIE]
Starting tomorrow,

00:12:42.804 --> 00:12:45.181 position:50% align:center
I'm giving you a crash course
in common sense.

00:12:45.265 --> 00:12:48.309 position:50% align:center
Yes, ma'am!
It would be my honor!

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:55.191 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD gasps]
The big city!

00:12:56.985 --> 00:12:59.112 position:50% align:center
Look at this place!

00:12:59.195 --> 00:13:00.280 position:50% align:center
[MALE A]
Quite a crowd.

00:13:00.363 --> 00:13:02.407 position:50% align:center
Must be for the
Foundation Festival today.

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:03.783 position:50% align:center
You should see all
the folks lining up

00:13:03.867 --> 00:13:05.785 position:50% align:center
outside the military academy.

00:13:05.869 --> 00:13:07.412 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:13:07.495 --> 00:13:11.291 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD] Huh, didn't realize
there'd be so many.

00:13:11.374 --> 00:13:13.418 position:50% align:center
If you ask me, they're
nothing but trouble.

00:13:13.501 --> 00:13:15.337 position:50% align:center
Whole city's crawling
with spies now.

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:17.464 position:50% align:center
Worse than that,
they say some shady bastards

00:13:17.547 --> 00:13:19.257 position:50% align:center
are trying to
smuggle in monsters.

00:13:19.341 --> 00:13:22.469 position:50% align:center
Smuggling monsters?

00:13:22.552 --> 00:13:27.098 position:50% align:center
You have to focus! You're
on a mission! Stay sharp!

00:13:31.728 --> 00:13:33.396 position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:13:34.647 --> 00:13:37.901 position:50% align:center
Wait a minute, I know that face.

00:13:37.984 --> 00:13:40.278 position:50% align:center
Looks like the rumors
are true after all.

00:13:40.362 --> 00:13:44.157 position:50% align:center
The Belt Princess really is
applying to the academy.

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.743 position:50% align:center
That's right, just ignore me!
Who cares if you've made

00:13:46.826 --> 00:13:48.912 position:50% align:center
the nobility a
laughing stock, right?

00:13:48.995 --> 00:13:50.914 position:50% align:center
Do whatever you want!

00:13:53.541 --> 00:13:54.709 position:50% align:center
[ALAN]
Hmph.

00:14:01.216 --> 00:14:02.342 position:50% align:center
[roar]

00:14:02.425 --> 00:14:03.176 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:03.259 --> 00:14:06.096 position:50% align:center
[heavy footsteps]

00:14:14.396 --> 00:14:15.605 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:49.347 --> 00:14:50.515 position:50% align:center
[LLOYD grunts]

00:14:53.059 --> 00:14:56.104 position:50% align:center
You wouldn't think there'd be
so many insects in a city!

00:14:56.187 --> 00:14:57.480 position:50% align:center
[SELEN gasps]

00:14:59.024 --> 00:15:01.568 position:50% align:center
Sorry about that, you okay?

00:15:04.696 --> 00:15:07.157 position:50% align:center
Those things can really
take you by surprise.

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:10.118 position:50% align:center
Hm? Uh-oh.

00:15:10.201 --> 00:15:12.245 position:50% align:center
You've got some
dirt on your gear.

00:15:14.914 --> 00:15:16.124 position:50% align:center
That ought'a do it.

00:15:16.207 --> 00:15:20.378 position:50% align:center
[SELEN gasping]

00:15:20.462 --> 00:15:22.380 position:50% align:center
Now if you'll excuse me,
I hate to be rude,

00:15:22.464 --> 00:15:24.549 position:50% align:center
but I'm on a really
important mission.

00:15:24.632 --> 00:15:28.303 position:50% align:center
[SELEN] Wait, I-- Thank you for
the help, my name's Selen!

00:15:28.386 --> 00:15:32.599 position:50% align:center
Ha! No trouble at all, my
name's Lloyd. See ya round!

00:15:49.115 --> 00:15:51.534 position:50% align:center
[inaudible]

00:15:54.996 --> 00:15:57.165 position:50% align:center
It wouldn't kill me to
put on a little makeup,

00:15:57.248 --> 00:16:00.168 position:50% align:center
just in case I run
into him again.

00:16:09.219 --> 00:16:11.012 position:50% align:center
[MAN A]
Just look at that face!

00:16:11.096 --> 00:16:14.516 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN A] And there's no way to
take it off? Can you imagine?

00:16:14.599 --> 00:16:16.893 position:50% align:center
[MAN B] I'm telling you,
the girl is cursed.

00:16:16.976 --> 00:16:20.063 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN B]
Some life for a princess!

00:16:20.146 --> 00:16:21.815 position:50% align:center
[SELEN'S FATHER]
Please, Elder!

00:16:21.898 --> 00:16:24.567 position:50% align:center
Bless my child with
words of salvation!

00:16:24.651 --> 00:16:27.195 position:50% align:center
[PASTOR] Alas, my benedictions
are of no use

00:16:27.278 --> 00:16:31.366 position:50% align:center
to such a pitiable creature.
Only strength can save her.

00:16:31.449 --> 00:16:36.538 position:50% align:center
Strength will come by the slow
and steady march of time.

00:16:36.621 --> 00:16:38.289 position:50% align:center
[SELEN]
From that moment on,

00:16:38.373 --> 00:16:43.294 position:50% align:center
I pushed myself harder
and harder every day!

00:16:43.378 --> 00:16:48.967 position:50% align:center
Constantly! And what have
I got to show for it?

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:53.304 position:50% align:center
If I could, I'd rip this
belt off like a scab!

00:16:53.388 --> 00:16:54.639 position:50% align:center
I'll break this curse!

00:16:54.723 --> 00:16:57.559 position:50% align:center
Who cares if my skin
comes off in the process!

00:17:04.858 --> 00:17:07.068 position:50% align:center
How did I--?

00:17:07.152 --> 00:17:10.405 position:50% align:center
[SELEN gasps]
That stranger...

00:17:12.699 --> 00:17:14.743 position:50% align:center
[SELEN]
He did this.

00:17:19.372 --> 00:17:21.124 position:50% align:center
It was never me.

00:17:21.207 --> 00:17:24.627 position:50% align:center
My destiny's always
relied on someone else.

00:17:29.174 --> 00:17:32.010 position:50% align:center
[MARIE] Okay, you know
your way around a market!

00:17:32.093 --> 00:17:34.262 position:50% align:center
It wasn't so difficult.

00:17:34.346 --> 00:17:37.599 position:50% align:center
I bought a little souvenir with
the money I had left over.

00:17:39.809 --> 00:17:41.353 position:50% align:center
Are you giving that to me?

00:17:41.436 --> 00:17:44.439 position:50% align:center
'Course I am!

00:17:44.522 --> 00:17:46.316 position:50% align:center
Thanks, very thoughtful of you.

00:17:46.399 --> 00:17:49.444 position:50% align:center
'Bout time for me to
get started on dinner.

00:17:56.326 --> 00:18:01.790 position:50% align:center
[CHOLINE] Wow, way more people
this year. Lots of variety.

00:18:01.873 --> 00:18:02.957 position:50% align:center
Good haul.

00:18:03.041 --> 00:18:04.626 position:50% align:center
I've got to hand it to you,
Merthophan,

00:18:04.709 --> 00:18:06.795 position:50% align:center
you must've scoured
far and wide.

00:18:06.878 --> 00:18:08.755 position:50% align:center
[MERTHOPHAN]
We need a strong military.

00:18:08.838 --> 00:18:11.508 position:50% align:center
The peace of our kingdom
teeters on a razor's edge.

00:18:11.591 --> 00:18:14.928 position:50% align:center
Foreign relations unravel by
the hour, and lest we forget,

00:18:15.011 --> 00:18:18.139 position:50% align:center
the princess's whereabouts
are still unknown.

00:18:18.223 --> 00:18:23.269 position:50% align:center
I see your point.
Some of these people, though...

00:18:23.353 --> 00:18:27.399 position:50% align:center
For example, Riho Flavin,
the "One-Armed Mercenary."

00:18:27.482 --> 00:18:30.902 position:50% align:center
Hot-tempered, maladjusted,
notoriously fickle.

00:18:30.985 --> 00:18:32.445 position:50% align:center
Wanted on multiple
counts of assault

00:18:32.529 --> 00:18:34.823 position:50% align:center
against clients who
don't like her methods.

00:18:34.906 --> 00:18:36.658 position:50% align:center
Also has several
outstanding warrants

00:18:36.741 --> 00:18:38.118 position:50% align:center
for jumping the border.

00:18:38.201 --> 00:18:39.619 position:50% align:center
[MERTHOPHAN]
I know the type.

00:18:39.703 --> 00:18:42.789 position:50% align:center
Put a solid contract in front
of her and she'll be fine.

00:18:42.872 --> 00:18:44.666 position:50% align:center
Do I wanna know
what that means?

00:18:44.749 --> 00:18:48.420 position:50% align:center
[MERTHOPHAN] I had all charges
dropped as a signing bonus.

00:18:48.503 --> 00:18:50.296 position:50% align:center
That's one way of doing it.

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:51.673 position:50% align:center

You can't fool me!

[gasps] That must be nobleman
Alan Toin Lidocaine,

00:18:55.135 --> 00:18:57.429 position:50% align:center
eldest son of the
prestigious military family.

00:18:57.512 --> 00:18:59.264 position:50% align:center
He has something
of a reputation.

00:18:59.347 --> 00:19:00.432 position:50% align:center
[MERTHOPHAN]
He does.

00:19:00.515 --> 00:19:02.934 position:50% align:center
[CHOLINE]
Who's that he's facing off with?

00:19:03.018 --> 00:19:05.520 position:50% align:center
You were never under any curse.
You can take off that

00:19:05.603 --> 00:19:09.107 position:50% align:center
preposterous belt
whenever you please.

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:11.776 position:50% align:center
[CHOLINE]
Never mind, I think I know.

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:13.028 position:50% align:center
Who in their right
mind goes around

00:19:13.111 --> 00:19:14.988 position:50% align:center
playing on the sympathy
of strangers?

00:19:15.071 --> 00:19:17.365 position:50% align:center
You're spoiling my
chances at promotion!

00:19:17.449 --> 00:19:19.868 position:50% align:center
Now there's a man who wears
his heart on his sleeve.

00:19:19.951 --> 00:19:21.286 position:50% align:center
[MERTHOPHAN]
He's ambitious, all right,

00:19:21.369 --> 00:19:23.329 position:50% align:center
and he doesn't care who knows.

00:19:23.413 --> 00:19:25.957 position:50% align:center
When I told him he'd make
officer just for enlisting,

00:19:26.041 --> 00:19:29.044 position:50% align:center
he signed on without giving
it a second thought.

00:19:29.127 --> 00:19:30.754 position:50% align:center
Well, he seems useful,

00:19:30.837 --> 00:19:34.299 position:50% align:center
so it's probably a good idea
to have him around.

00:19:34.382 --> 00:19:37.218 position:50% align:center
[RIHO]
Hm... So that's how it is.

00:19:37.302 --> 00:19:39.346 position:50% align:center
Makes sense that
competition would be stiff.

00:19:39.429 --> 00:19:41.306 position:50% align:center
They've canvassed the
realm for candidates.

00:19:41.389 --> 00:19:48.855 position:50% align:center
And that's fine, I can hold
my own. Just not with him!

00:19:48.938 --> 00:19:51.149 position:50% align:center
He may look like your
garden-variety pipsqueak,

00:19:51.232 --> 00:19:53.401 position:50% align:center
but behind that innocent
façade lurks a monster!

00:19:53.485 --> 00:19:57.280 position:50% align:center
Uh! I'm getting
butterflies in my tummy.

00:19:57.364 --> 00:19:59.908 position:50% align:center
[RIHO whimpers] It's official!
I've clearly underestimated

00:19:59.991 --> 00:20:01.576 position:50% align:center
the caliber of people
who showed up for this!

00:20:01.659 --> 00:20:04.537 position:50% align:center
Hi, there, are you
as nervous as I am?

00:20:04.621 --> 00:20:06.039 position:50% align:center
Um, no?

00:20:06.122 --> 00:20:08.583 position:50% align:center
Anyone ever tell you
how cool that arm is?

00:20:08.667 --> 00:20:12.003 position:50% align:center
[RIHO] What am I doing?
He'll think I'm challenging him!

00:20:12.087 --> 00:20:13.672 position:50% align:center
--Oh!

I'm totally dead.

I'm sorry, I haven't
properly introduced myself.

00:20:18.176 --> 00:20:20.470 position:50% align:center
Lloyd Belladonna,
at your service.

00:20:20.553 --> 00:20:25.892 position:50% align:center
Uh... Oh, um, my
name's Riho Flavin--

00:20:28.436 --> 00:20:29.771 position:50% align:center
Oh, Sir Lloyd!

00:20:29.854 --> 00:20:32.315 position:50% align:center
I knew the hand of fate
would push us together again!

00:20:32.399 --> 00:20:34.818 position:50% align:center
Uh. You're that person from
the other day, aren't you?

00:20:34.901 --> 00:20:37.404 position:50% align:center
Selen Hemein: truly
and faithfully yours!

00:20:37.487 --> 00:20:39.781 position:50% align:center
Hey, are you applying to
the military academy, too?

00:20:39.864 --> 00:20:43.034 position:50% align:center
Selen Hemein: truly
and faithfully yours!

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:48.373 position:50% align:center
Um, beg your pardon.
Who is this supposed to be?

00:20:48.456 --> 00:20:50.208 position:50% align:center
[RIHO]
Fantastic, this one's bonkers!

00:20:50.291 --> 00:20:52.794 position:50% align:center
Was that sarcastic or
are you just blind?

00:20:52.877 --> 00:20:53.962 position:50% align:center
[RIHO]
Oh, god, help!

00:20:54.045 --> 00:20:55.964 position:50% align:center
That's Miss Riho.
She's another candidate.

00:20:56.047 --> 00:20:58.216 position:50% align:center
We both just met
a few moments ago.

00:20:58.299 --> 00:21:01.553 position:50% align:center
Silly me, of course you did.
Isn't that nice.

00:21:01.636 --> 00:21:03.680 position:50% align:center
[RIHO]
Huh...?

00:21:03.763 --> 00:21:07.726 position:50% align:center
What's the story with those two?
A country bumpkin and a noble?

00:21:07.809 --> 00:21:12.272 position:50% align:center
Someone's trying to
make Daddy mad. Good.

00:21:12.355 --> 00:21:15.108 position:50% align:center
'Cause where there's
rebellion, there's money!

00:21:16.234 --> 00:21:17.694 position:50% align:center
Look alive!

00:21:17.777 --> 00:21:20.113 position:50% align:center
The field combat portion of
the entrance exam begins now!

[STUDENTS chatter]

00:21:21.197 --> 00:21:22.407 position:50% align:center
Candidates will
attack this dummy

[STUDENT A]
What?

00:21:25.618 --> 00:21:27.495 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT B] Think they covered
it with enough metal plates?

00:21:31.207 --> 00:21:32.876 position:50% align:center
[MERTHOPHAN]
Hmm...

00:21:34.127 --> 00:21:35.795 position:50% align:center
S'cuse me, Mr. Merthophan?

00:21:35.879 --> 00:21:38.590 position:50% align:center
Don't bother saying it.
You're quitting.

00:21:38.673 --> 00:21:41.384 position:50% align:center
And to think I let myself
expect better of you.

00:21:41.468 --> 00:21:43.720 position:50% align:center
Like I don't know a good
thing when I see it.

00:21:43.803 --> 00:21:45.930 position:50% align:center
I'm not about to pass up
a golden opportunity

00:21:46.014 --> 00:21:48.850 position:50% align:center
to clear my record while also
doin' what I'm good at.

00:21:48.933 --> 00:21:52.062 position:50% align:center
Especially when I can grab
a little cash in the process.

00:21:52.145 --> 00:21:54.064 position:50% align:center
[MERTHOPHAN]
Then how may I help you?

00:21:54.147 --> 00:21:57.108 position:50% align:center
[RIHO] Nothing major,
just a quick question.

00:21:57.192 --> 00:21:58.485 position:50% align:center
What is that kid?

00:21:58.568 --> 00:22:00.028 position:50% align:center
No idea.

00:22:00.111 --> 00:22:01.780 position:50% align:center
What do you mean "no idea"?
You're the one who vetted us!

00:22:01.863 --> 00:22:03.782 position:50% align:center
I didn't scout him, he's just
some random volunteer!

00:22:03.865 --> 00:22:06.284 position:50% align:center
For all I know, he could be
a demon lord in disguise!

00:22:06.368 --> 00:22:08.203 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I've been
twisting myself into knots

00:22:08.286 --> 00:22:09.621 position:50% align:center
ever since he showed up!

00:22:09.704 --> 00:22:11.664 position:50% align:center
[RIHO]
Great...

00:22:11.748 --> 00:22:13.208 position:50% align:center
[MERTHOPHAN]
I say this in confidence,

00:22:13.291 --> 00:22:15.919 position:50% align:center
but I'm not sure the combined
forces of everyone here

00:22:16.002 --> 00:22:17.087 position:50% align:center
could take him.

00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:18.463 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER 1B]
Group C, you're up.

00:22:18.546 --> 00:22:20.757 position:50% align:center

if you don't mind!

00:22:39.859 --> 00:22:41.277 position:50% align:center
Right this second?!

00:22:41.361 --> 00:22:42.904 position:50% align:center
No need to get all snippy.

[MERTHOPHAN grumbles]

00:22:44.364 --> 00:22:45.490 position:50% align:center
[MERTHOPHAN]
Very well,

00:22:45.573 --> 00:22:48.243 position:50% align:center
I shouldn't fixate on
a single candidate.

00:22:48.326 --> 00:22:51.162 position:50% align:center
I'm overthinking it.
The boy's got talent.

00:22:51.246 --> 00:22:53.915 position:50% align:center
He'll be an asset. Surely.

00:22:53.998 --> 00:22:54.749 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER A]
Begin!

00:22:54.833 --> 00:22:56.501 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir!

00:22:59.087 --> 00:23:01.006 position:50% align:center
[MARIE] They should be posting
Lloyd's test results

00:23:01.089 --> 00:23:03.091 position:50% align:center
before too long.

00:23:03.174 --> 00:23:05.301 position:50% align:center
I'd love some coffee if it's
not too much trouble!

00:23:05.385 --> 00:23:06.970 position:50% align:center
Why are you back already?

00:23:07.053 --> 00:23:10.640 position:50% align:center
Oh, uh, I was just anxious to
know how Lloyd did on the exam.

00:23:10.724 --> 00:23:12.517 position:50% align:center
Patience isn't my thing.

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:14.811 position:50% align:center
What could you possibly
be worried about?

00:23:14.894 --> 00:23:17.022 position:50% align:center
He might think of himself
as weak and unexceptional,

00:23:17.105 --> 00:23:20.442 position:50% align:center
but my goodness--
he's off the charts!

00:23:21.901 --> 00:23:23.486 position:50% align:center
You do know that
bringing your own cup

00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:26.072 position:50% align:center
implies you think
mine are disgusting!

00:23:26.156 --> 00:23:29.284 position:50% align:center
Ugh, as I was saying,
it's only natural

00:23:29.367 --> 00:23:31.786 position:50% align:center
for Lloyd to be such a
remarkably talented boy.

00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:33.496 position:50% align:center
His village is where
the saviors journeyed

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:36.833 position:50% align:center
to take refuge
from civilization.

00:23:36.916 --> 00:23:38.918 position:50% align:center
Kunlun, the place of legend

00:23:39.002 --> 00:23:42.088 position:50% align:center
just outside the sinister
"Last Dungeon."
