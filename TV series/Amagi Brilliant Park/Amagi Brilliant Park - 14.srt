1
00:00:22,976 --> 00:00:23,640
What is it?

2
00:00:24,193 --> 00:00:25,176
Isuzu-ron?

3
00:00:25,245 --> 00:00:26,902
Is the plan still on for tonight?

4
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,841
Yes, go ahead and proceed, please.

5
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:30,801
Gotcha! See ya later.

6
00:02:19,605 --> 00:02:20,140
Good morning...

7
00:02:20,165 --> 00:02:21,505
Perfect as usual.

8
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,667
Don't you get tired of doing that every day?

9
00:02:23,692 --> 00:02:25,294
Nope. Not in the slightest!

10
00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:26,271
Oh.

11
00:02:26,296 --> 00:02:29,005
By the way... When is the AC gonna be fixed?

12
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,718
Tomorrow at the earliest.

13
00:02:31,174 --> 00:02:32,236
Ugh...

14
00:02:34,086 --> 00:02:36,814
B-by the way Kanie, I wanted to give you a...

15
00:02:37,429 --> 00:02:38,320
Hold that thought.

16
00:02:39,524 --> 00:02:40,354
It's Kanie.

17
00:02:41,353 --> 00:02:42,377
Oh, good morning.

18
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:46,931
Right now? Oh no, it's not a problem.

19
00:02:46,956 --> 00:02:47,906
I'll be right over.

20
00:02:48,805 --> 00:02:50,611
Latifah says she needs to talk to me.

21
00:02:51,328 --> 00:02:52,526
Um, Kanie?

22
00:02:52,642 --> 00:02:53,243
What is it?

23
00:02:54,703 --> 00:02:56,983
I um... no, never-mind.

24
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,317
Okay. See ya.

25
00:03:08,843 --> 00:03:10,919
I can't wait to see his face!

26
00:03:10,944 --> 00:03:12,509
It's gonna be so awesome!

27
00:03:12,534 --> 00:03:13,709
Morning-moff.

28
00:03:13,734 --> 00:03:14,600
Morning-mii.

29
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:15,609
Morning-ron.

30
00:03:15,878 --> 00:03:17,578
What's with the tuxedo?

31
00:03:17,701 --> 00:03:20,115
PR work at Wakuwaku Preschool.

32
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,023
Wakuwaku Preschool-mii?!

33
00:03:22,048 --> 00:03:25,054
That's right, I forgot! Today's the yearly visit!

34
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:29,160
Moff... I was thinking I'd take those
three new girls as part of their training.

35
00:03:29,185 --> 00:03:30,314
Hope they make it.

36
00:03:30,352 --> 00:03:32,846
If they survive, they're ready for anything.

37
00:03:32,871 --> 00:03:34,872
Take care of everything while I'm gone.

38
00:03:35,025 --> 00:03:36,025
No problem!

39
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,449
What about tonight?

40
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:41,425
Under control. I got catering
from a really good Italian place.

41
00:03:41,807 --> 00:03:43,915
Good! Thanks for taking care of it.

42
00:03:45,277 --> 00:03:47,975
I'm sorry I made you come all the way here, Miss Isuzu.

43
00:03:48,093 --> 00:03:50,423
It's fine... So what was the problem?

44
00:03:50,585 --> 00:03:52,076
Well, I slept funny...

45
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,629
And now my neck's twisted!

46
00:03:54,696 --> 00:03:57,055
Okay... that's not good...

47
00:03:58,523 --> 00:04:02,199
Listen. Do you really think I have
what it takes to do Mr. Moffle's job?

48
00:04:02,305 --> 00:04:04,414
All you have to do is wave-mii!

49
00:04:04,508 --> 00:04:05,281
Right.

50
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,973
Um, I think my legs are showing.

51
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:15,606
Hmm... Eh, it's fine.

52
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:16,797
Eiko Adachi!

53
00:04:16,822 --> 00:04:17,531
Present!

54
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,389
Biino Bando!

55
00:04:18,414 --> 00:04:19,217
Present!

56
00:04:19,242 --> 00:04:20,120
Shiina Chujo!

57
00:04:20,145 --> 00:04:21,080
I'm here!

58
00:04:21,105 --> 00:04:23,571
Moff... I'm glad all three of you showed up.

59
00:04:23,915 --> 00:04:27,427
Excuse me, Mr. Moffle... What exactly are we doing today?

60
00:04:27,681 --> 00:04:31,058
We're doing some off-grounds
PR work as part of your training.

61
00:04:31,202 --> 00:04:33,313
PR work... off-grounds?

62
00:04:33,338 --> 00:04:36,430
We're visiting Wakuwaku Preschool in Amagi City.

63
00:04:36,534 --> 00:04:40,892
The goal is to make a good impression so
they'll decide to come for their fall field trip.

64
00:04:40,917 --> 00:04:41,757
S-sounds good.

65
00:04:42,129 --> 00:04:43,471
That's what I like to hear.

66
00:04:43,503 --> 00:04:44,890
Get ready to-aaaghh!

67
00:04:44,994 --> 00:04:45,681
Hmm?

68
00:04:46,088 --> 00:04:48,454
Moff it all! I forgot something!

69
00:04:48,638 --> 00:04:49,369
What was it?

70
00:04:49,533 --> 00:04:51,713
They're expecting us to bring a prize.

71
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:55,271
Bando... I think it's in the
admin room, could you grab it?

72
00:04:55,306 --> 00:04:56,921
Just leave it to me sir!

73
00:04:58,914 --> 00:05:02,189
Here's the information on the
Maple Land Senate Budgetary Committee.

74
00:05:02,932 --> 00:05:06,671
Oh thanks... I was pretty sure I
told Ashe to handle this for me though.

75
00:05:07,047 --> 00:05:11,122
Well, I know my way around these kinds of
files anyway, so I went ahead and located it.

76
00:05:11,435 --> 00:05:13,476
I wanted to be of use to you somehow.

77
00:05:14,294 --> 00:05:14,741
Hmm?

78
00:05:17,004 --> 00:05:18,281
It's from Sento.

79
00:05:18,315 --> 00:05:18,984
Go on.

80
00:05:19,302 --> 00:05:19,927
Sorry.

81
00:05:21,952 --> 00:05:22,985
Ah jeez.

82
00:05:23,382 --> 00:05:24,451
Did something happen?

83
00:05:24,946 --> 00:05:27,129
Muse twisted her neck pretty bad last night...

84
00:05:27,338 --> 00:05:29,166
So she's not gonna be able to perform.

85
00:05:29,271 --> 00:05:30,118
Oh...

86
00:05:32,636 --> 00:05:33,852
Please excuse me!

87
00:05:34,226 --> 00:05:36,346
Huh? Nobody's in here...

88
00:05:37,029 --> 00:05:38,462
I wonder where it could be...

89
00:05:38,542 --> 00:05:39,763
Oh, right there!

90
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,164
Gotcha!

91
00:05:52,315 --> 00:05:53,181
So hot...

92
00:05:53,275 --> 00:05:56,007
Look mommy, I can see the man inside the Moffle suit!

93
00:05:56,032 --> 00:05:58,384
Shush! Just pretend you don't notice it!

94
00:05:58,577 --> 00:05:59,795
Sorry for the wait!

95
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,316
Oh is that the prize?

96
00:06:01,388 --> 00:06:01,859
Yep!

97
00:06:02,191 --> 00:06:04,453
Moff... smaller than I thought.

98
00:06:12,817 --> 00:06:13,699
Okay, got it.

99
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:16,437
We just need someone to replace Muse, right?

100
00:06:16,804 --> 00:06:18,474
That's basically it, yes.

101
00:06:18,598 --> 00:06:19,795
Here's what we'll do.

102
00:06:25,113 --> 00:06:29,338
Sento's got fairly good reflexes, and
Latifah can handle the paperwork for a while.

103
00:06:29,606 --> 00:06:31,267
Muse, you go rest up in the garden.

104
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,824
Can I really pull this off?

105
00:06:33,863 --> 00:06:35,267
I-I'll do what I can!

106
00:06:35,405 --> 00:06:38,204
Are you sure it's okay for me to be wearing this dress?

107
00:06:38,267 --> 00:06:41,623
I get that we need somebody to
fill in for Muse and Miss Isuzu but...

108
00:06:41,732 --> 00:06:43,870
doesn't the princess just kinda sit there?

109
00:06:44,607 --> 00:06:46,400
Salama, that was rude!

110
00:06:47,022 --> 00:06:48,535
S-sorry princess!

111
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,730
Oh no... that's correct, actually.

112
00:06:51,171 --> 00:06:53,405
I will need you to make the croquettes though.

113
00:06:53,877 --> 00:06:56,023
Sir Nick can explain the details.

114
00:06:56,197 --> 00:06:57,360
Um... okay!

115
00:06:57,464 --> 00:06:58,620
That should settle it then.

116
00:07:00,305 --> 00:07:02,883
This concludes the first performance of the day.

117
00:07:02,908 --> 00:07:04,503
We hope you enjoyed the show.

118
00:07:08,724 --> 00:07:09,612
What's up?

119
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:11,413
The catering place-ron?

120
00:07:11,438 --> 00:07:13,493
Yeah we're still planning to do it this evening.

121
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,437
Huh?! What do you mean you're gonna have to cancel?!

122
00:07:16,968 --> 00:07:19,885
Mass food poisoning?! Are you kidding me-ron?!

123
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:22,090
Why's he wobbling?

124
00:07:28,241 --> 00:07:30,346
Whoa! Did you pee-mii?!

125
00:07:30,371 --> 00:07:32,538
No it's sweat, I swear...

126
00:07:37,438 --> 00:07:41,053
Now... let's all welcome our
guests from Amagi Brilliant Park.

127
00:07:43,126 --> 00:07:44,996
Hello there everybody!

128
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:48,833
Ah, Mr. Moffle?

129
00:07:48,987 --> 00:07:51,598
Those girls don't look like they're tough enough for this.

130
00:07:51,623 --> 00:07:54,019
It'll be a good learning experience.

131
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:55,552
Alright...

132
00:07:56,771 --> 00:07:57,805
Hey AmaBri!

133
00:07:57,905 --> 00:07:59,632
You losers better step off!

134
00:07:59,657 --> 00:08:01,853
Yeah, the fall field trip is ours!

135
00:08:01,878 --> 00:08:04,488
These kids are comin' to Tama Kartland!

136
00:08:04,726 --> 00:08:07,184
Hmph... Stupid marsupials.

137
00:08:07,209 --> 00:08:08,999
Wh-who are those guys?

138
00:08:09,277 --> 00:08:10,924
Oh, that's the enemy team.

139
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:11,871
Huh?

140
00:08:11,896 --> 00:08:14,957
It's time to head on over to Wakuwaku Coliseum.

141
00:08:15,149 --> 00:08:15,848
YAY!

142
00:08:20,008 --> 00:08:21,680
I need you to sort these files.

143
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,914
Put everything that has to do with
Animus in its own individual stack.

144
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:26,542
I think I can manage that.

145
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,904
Ugh. It's like an oven in here! I hope you'll be okay.

146
00:08:31,182 --> 00:08:34,954
Oh yes... I brought a Nix Wind
Chime with me, so I'm almost chilly.

147
00:08:35,718 --> 00:08:36,241
Really?

148
00:08:36,405 --> 00:08:37,970
I don't feel any different.

149
00:08:38,079 --> 00:08:39,396
Oh, it isn't working?

150
00:08:40,446 --> 00:08:43,114
Perhaps it doesn't affect
inhabitants of the natural world.

151
00:08:43,605 --> 00:08:44,495
Hmmm...

152
00:08:44,971 --> 00:08:48,946
Anyway, I'll watch over the office, so
please do whatever you need to do today.

153
00:08:49,234 --> 00:08:49,981
Okay...

154
00:08:51,212 --> 00:08:53,024
If you're sure, I guess I'll go.

155
00:08:53,112 --> 00:08:55,116
Of course! Take care then!

156
00:09:02,752 --> 00:09:05,376
I'm the water spirit... Call me Muse.

157
00:09:06,807 --> 00:09:08,431
Welcome to Elementario.

158
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,380
Your delivery is terrible.

159
00:09:10,428 --> 00:09:11,344
Again.

160
00:09:19,671 --> 00:09:21,385
I could get used to this...

161
00:09:21,433 --> 00:09:22,671
Hey, there you are.

162
00:09:23,383 --> 00:09:26,286
I'm supposed to teach you how to make croquettes.

163
00:09:27,727 --> 00:09:34,401
Kick their butts! Kick their butts! Kick their butts!

164
00:09:34,426 --> 00:09:40,480
Here at Wakuwaku Preschool our policy is "fight for
what you want and beat up anyone who gets in your way"

165
00:09:40,505 --> 00:09:44,126
so if you want that field trip,
better fight like you mean it!

166
00:09:44,151 --> 00:09:46,792
She's not kidding. Get ready for a moffin' bloodbath.

167
00:09:47,696 --> 00:09:50,168
This is what PR work is all about.

168
00:09:50,193 --> 00:09:51,271
I won't let you down!

169
00:09:51,296 --> 00:09:52,028
Huh?!

170
00:09:52,238 --> 00:09:53,501
You're first, Eiko!

171
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:56,098
Show those koala creeps who's boss!

172
00:09:56,206 --> 00:09:57,254
O-okay...

173
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,937
Round 1 starts now!

174
00:09:59,002 --> 00:10:02,035
Welcome the first challenger from Amagi Brilliant Park...

175
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,881
Miss Eiko Adachi!

176
00:10:03,906 --> 00:10:06,063
And in Tama Kartland's corner...

177
00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:08,517
the dreaded King Crimson!

178
00:10:29,917 --> 00:10:31,013
Hey, you're up next!

179
00:10:31,038 --> 00:10:32,033
Hm? Okay!

180
00:10:33,371 --> 00:10:34,209
Yes, tonight...

181
00:10:34,242 --> 00:10:36,176
I've been turned down by 4 places now.

182
00:10:36,201 --> 00:10:38,425
No wait a sec! Can't we make a deal?

183
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:39,485
C'mon, be a pal-ron...

184
00:10:39,512 --> 00:10:40,966
That was a bad idea.

185
00:10:42,765 --> 00:10:45,449
Prepare for a world of pain!

186
00:10:46,026 --> 00:10:47,084
Anything goes!

187
00:10:47,109 --> 00:10:48,071
Wahoo!

188
00:10:48,096 --> 00:10:49,545
Pulverize her!

189
00:10:51,866 --> 00:10:52,831
That girl...

190
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:54,178
From the theme park...

191
00:10:54,203 --> 00:10:55,448
She's close!

192
00:10:56,604 --> 00:10:59,801
They like to market that red guy as a laid-back character.

193
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:03,049
But once he snaps he gets pretty bloodthirsty.

194
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,051
Uh-oh...

195
00:11:05,227 --> 00:11:06,387
Oh no! Eiko!

196
00:11:06,412 --> 00:11:09,126
1! 2! 3!

197
00:11:13,615 --> 00:11:17,184
This goes here... And that goes there.

198
00:11:20,733 --> 00:11:22,246
That's the end of that box.

199
00:11:24,721 --> 00:11:25,976
Secretary's desk?

200
00:11:26,502 --> 00:11:29,160
Hm? It's about the written estimate for the parade?

201
00:11:30,033 --> 00:11:30,810
Let's see...

202
00:11:34,232 --> 00:11:36,550
I'm the earth spirit... Kobory.

203
00:11:36,584 --> 00:11:38,981
I hope you enjoy the show today.

204
00:11:39,006 --> 00:11:40,795
That's just as bad as before.

205
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:41,720
Again!

206
00:11:44,828 --> 00:11:45,237
Huh?

207
00:11:45,262 --> 00:11:47,734
First I need you to mince all these onions.

208
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:49,671
This whole box? By myself?

209
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:51,909
Princess Latifah never has trouble with it.

210
00:11:58,389 --> 00:12:01,330
Please proceed according to the schedule I sent.

211
00:12:01,355 --> 00:12:02,494
Yes, I'm bowing with...

212
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:03,731
Product samples are here.

213
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,495
This is accounting.

214
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,608
Of course, give me one moment.

215
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,650
I'm pulling that invoice for you.

216
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:12,772
Ah yes, this is the one...

217
00:12:13,109 --> 00:12:15,609
Right, the payment hasn't been processed yet.

218
00:12:15,738 --> 00:12:17,517
Yes... Have a great day.

219
00:12:18,007 --> 00:12:21,460
Excuse me sir, I need to get something
from that drawer if you don't mind.

220
00:12:22,109 --> 00:12:22,783
Sure.

221
00:12:23,022 --> 00:12:24,136
One second please.

222
00:12:26,825 --> 00:12:27,578
Thank you.

223
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:28,555
Mm-hm.

224
00:12:36,111 --> 00:12:38,092
Moving on to round two!

225
00:12:38,197 --> 00:12:41,190
Biino Bando versus Grand Blue!

226
00:12:41,224 --> 00:12:43,565
I'm gonna eat you alive!

227
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:50,286
The blue koala supposedly has a relaxed personality,
but once that moffer loses his temper it's all over.

228
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:53,017
But that's exactly the same as the first one!

229
00:12:53,042 --> 00:12:54,947
True. Except...

230
00:12:55,114 --> 00:12:57,903
You've got nowhere to run, you little rat!

231
00:12:59,724 --> 00:13:00,944
Ow, that hurt...

232
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:06,725
the guy's terrified of blood.

233
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:10,770
Grand Blue down! Biino Bando wins!

234
00:13:11,266 --> 00:13:12,025
Yayyyy!

235
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:12,858
Look everybody!

236
00:13:12,883 --> 00:13:14,714
All's well that ends well.

237
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:21,263
A clock?

238
00:13:21,288 --> 00:13:22,516
That's stupid.

239
00:13:22,779 --> 00:13:24,441
Hey... how 'bout this?

240
00:13:27,635 --> 00:13:29,860
Please, you're my last option-ron!

241
00:13:29,948 --> 00:13:31,867
I'll throw in a little extra...

242
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:33,997
Agh... DAMMIT!

243
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,387
I see, so you'd like to change
tomorrow's meeting from 1 to 3?

244
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:40,237
Excuse me, I'm here about the advertisement schedule...

245
00:13:40,604 --> 00:13:41,824
Princess Latifah?

246
00:13:42,542 --> 00:13:43,466
I'm so sorry!

247
00:13:43,491 --> 00:13:44,830
Um, just a minute please!

248
00:13:45,301 --> 00:13:49,195
Hey Missy, I need a signature
for the... Hey what's with the line?

249
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,258
Hunch over and wait.

250
00:13:51,668 --> 00:13:53,270
Yes... Yes...

251
00:13:54,385 --> 00:13:56,041
Oh, you have two separate meetings?

252
00:13:59,361 --> 00:14:01,658
Spirit of the wind... I'm Sylphy.

253
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,235
Want to be friends?

254
00:14:03,419 --> 00:14:05,101
That was the worst yet!

255
00:14:05,236 --> 00:14:06,196
Again!

256
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,772
You done with the onions?

257
00:14:16,868 --> 00:14:17,954
Ah, yes!

258
00:14:19,528 --> 00:14:19,983
Huh?

259
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:22,657
Now peel all the potatoes in this box.

260
00:14:22,682 --> 00:14:23,417
All this? Myself?!

261
00:14:23,442 --> 00:14:26,455
Princess Latifah never has trouble with it.

262
00:14:31,532 --> 00:14:32,777
I'm from Marukawa.

263
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:35,440
Where should I put all these key holders you guys ordered?

264
00:14:37,295 --> 00:14:37,938
Got it.

265
00:14:39,034 --> 00:14:40,497
Hey I'm from Hinode Sewing.

266
00:14:40,522 --> 00:14:43,868
Is there a certain place you'd like me to
put the Moffle, Macaron and Tiramy dolls?

267
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:44,974
Got it.

268
00:14:44,999 --> 00:14:47,757
I'm from Amagi Transport.
Could you sign for these, please?

269
00:14:48,627 --> 00:14:50,812
Excuse me sir, but the unloading area's full.

270
00:14:50,837 --> 00:14:52,469
Where would you like me to put these?

271
00:14:52,697 --> 00:14:54,560
Oh, I can just leave 'em right here, huh?

272
00:14:54,828 --> 00:14:56,236
Okay thanks, have a good day.

273
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,984
Sorry to interrupt you sir,
but can I leave these here too?

274
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:01,083
Perfect. Thanks a lot.

275
00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:06,767
It's time for the final round!

276
00:15:06,941 --> 00:15:10,048
Shiina Chujo versus Stay Gold!

277
00:15:10,887 --> 00:15:12,481
I'll crush your bones to dust!

278
00:15:12,506 --> 00:15:16,281
Looks like his personality's a little
different than the other two, but yeah,

279
00:15:16,306 --> 00:15:19,314
it's basically the same deal whenever he gets angry.

280
00:15:19,428 --> 00:15:20,696
I'll remember that, sir!

281
00:15:20,789 --> 00:15:24,098
I wasn't aware it was acceptable
to attack your opponent with a chain.

282
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:26,482
Moff, who cares as long as she wins?

283
00:15:26,715 --> 00:15:27,898
Good thinking, sir!

284
00:15:27,923 --> 00:15:29,113
You're mine!

285
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:42,796
There it is! The winner is Shiina
Chujo! Amagi Brilliant Park wins 2-1!

286
00:15:44,453 --> 00:15:46,938
You put up a spectacular fight, AmaBri.

287
00:15:47,683 --> 00:15:49,399
We'll be seeing you in the fall.

288
00:15:49,711 --> 00:15:50,420
Thank you.

289
00:15:50,445 --> 00:15:52,486
You also get both of the prizes...

290
00:15:52,511 --> 00:15:54,604
Thank you again for coming today.

291
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:56,460
I appreciate that.

292
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:02,082
B-b-but I thought those p-prizes
were f-for the p-preschoolers!

293
00:16:02,216 --> 00:16:04,215
Would you have come if you had known?

294
00:16:05,888 --> 00:16:09,153
U-unfortunately the person in
charge isn't available that day...

295
00:16:09,178 --> 00:16:10,753
so I don't believe we'll be able to, um...

296
00:16:11,021 --> 00:16:12,223
Your Highness!

297
00:16:12,883 --> 00:16:15,098
Oh! Lady Ashe! I'm so sorry to keep you waiting!

298
00:16:15,456 --> 00:16:17,633
Um, do you need some help?

299
00:16:18,084 --> 00:16:20,641
Y-yes, if you don't mind! Thank you very much!

300
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:27,030
I'm the fire spirit... Salama.

301
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:29,294
I like internet flame wars...?

302
00:16:29,319 --> 00:16:32,183
Why are you so bad?! Start over from the top!

303
00:16:34,649 --> 00:16:36,626
But it's well into the evening by now.

304
00:16:36,651 --> 00:16:38,305
Welp! Guess we're not performing today.

305
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,110
Caspian Sea Monster!

306
00:16:45,396 --> 00:16:46,328
Jeez.

307
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:50,787
Huh?

308
00:16:59,008 --> 00:17:00,708
MIIIII!

309
00:17:08,783 --> 00:17:11,512
Ugh... she's way tougher than I thought.

310
00:17:12,683 --> 00:17:14,935
How does she do this by herself?!

311
00:17:25,594 --> 00:17:27,399
Moff, you're dismissed.

312
00:17:27,424 --> 00:17:30,410
Bando, could you go put the prizes in the admin room?

313
00:17:30,435 --> 00:17:31,224
Sure!

314
00:17:31,641 --> 00:17:32,450
Whew...

315
00:17:32,897 --> 00:17:34,737
I finally finished it...

316
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,757
I'd better go report to Sir Kanie now.

317
00:17:41,288 --> 00:17:42,469
Oh Princess!

318
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:44,398
Hello there, I was just going out...

319
00:17:44,423 --> 00:17:46,115
Shall I leave this door open?

320
00:17:46,204 --> 00:17:48,094
Sure. I'll close it when I get done.

321
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:49,723
Excellent. Take care then.

322
00:17:50,001 --> 00:17:51,360
Thanks; You too!

323
00:17:53,613 --> 00:17:55,532
Whew, there we go.

324
00:18:00,197 --> 00:18:02,276
Hey there Seiya, what are you up to?

325
00:18:02,786 --> 00:18:05,477
Working. The AC's broken in the admin room.

326
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:09,431
Moff... Well just so you know,
we got the preschool field trip.

327
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:11,199
Really? That's good to hear!

328
00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:13,721
It was all thanks to those three new part-timers...

329
00:18:13,761 --> 00:18:15,044
Make sure you thank'em.

330
00:18:15,148 --> 00:18:17,075
Sure thing. Thanks for your help today.

331
00:18:17,149 --> 00:18:17,896
Moff.

332
00:18:26,938 --> 00:18:28,407
Good work, everyone.

333
00:18:35,118 --> 00:18:37,990
We should probably stick to what we do best from now on.

334
00:18:38,178 --> 00:18:39,354
I agree with that.

335
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:43,141
Oh that's right, is your neck feeling better?

336
00:18:43,488 --> 00:18:46,358
Yeah, I'm totally fine now. Thanks for asking.

337
00:18:48,788 --> 00:18:52,536
Ah... So the preschool visit turned out to be a success.

338
00:19:08,653 --> 00:19:09,431
Sir Kanie?

339
00:19:09,456 --> 00:19:09,860
Hm?

340
00:19:10,103 --> 00:19:12,387
I don't suppose you could spare a brief moment?

341
00:19:12,665 --> 00:19:14,394
I guess... What do you two need?

342
00:19:14,632 --> 00:19:16,236
You'll have to see for yourself.

343
00:19:17,811 --> 00:19:21,156
Happy Birthday! Thanks for all you do!

344
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:24,572
Huh...?

345
00:19:24,949 --> 00:19:28,042
Ha! Check it out! He's so
surprised he can't even talk straight!

346
00:19:28,151 --> 00:19:30,609
The ambush mission was a success!

347
00:19:30,694 --> 00:19:31,836
He's crying!

348
00:19:31,906 --> 00:19:33,715
N-no I'm not! Don't be stupid!

349
00:19:36,285 --> 00:19:39,259
W-well, I guess I should
probably thank you knuckleheads...

350
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:43,870
Did you know about this too, princess?

351
00:19:44,076 --> 00:19:45,442
Yes, I'm sorry...

352
00:19:45,467 --> 00:19:48,265
Everyone asked me to keep it secret. I had no choice.

353
00:19:48,537 --> 00:19:51,511
Like it or not, we're here to
celebrate your birthday, Sir Kanie!

354
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,277
Yeah!

355
00:20:01,623 --> 00:20:02,977
Hmm... not bad.

356
00:20:03,473 --> 00:20:05,742
Why are we having somen noodles-mii?

357
00:20:05,806 --> 00:20:07,798
It's the only thing I could get.

358
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,209
Her Majesty has retired for the night.

359
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:04,109
That's good. You know, that really did surprise me.

360
00:21:04,157 --> 00:21:06,727
I've never had a birthday
party like that in my whole life.

361
00:21:07,167 --> 00:21:08,374
You really haven't?

362
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:11,942
Those guys are way too busy to
put something like this together.

363
00:21:12,017 --> 00:21:13,381
What am I gonna do with them?

364
00:21:16,235 --> 00:21:17,637
Check out what Latifah gave me.

365
00:21:18,499 --> 00:21:20,236
They're some kind of scented candles.

366
00:21:20,415 --> 00:21:20,951
Oh.

367
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:24,765
Actually...

368
00:21:24,829 --> 00:21:25,401
Hm?

369
00:21:25,491 --> 00:21:27,726
I-I got you a present too.

370
00:21:28,507 --> 00:21:30,455
So, um... you know...

371
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:30,958
Huh?

372
00:21:31,817 --> 00:21:33,210
It's not much, but... I...

373
00:21:34,009 --> 00:21:36,134
I just thought it...

374
00:21:37,994 --> 00:21:39,138
kind of suited you...

375
00:21:43,713 --> 00:21:45,229
So if you wouldn't mind...

376
00:21:45,571 --> 00:21:47,709
I... I want you to have it.

377
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:49,606
Um, okay...

378
00:21:51,722 --> 00:21:53,235
Well... goodnight!

379
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,334
Hm?!

380
00:22:07,716 --> 00:22:09,415
Cicada shells?
