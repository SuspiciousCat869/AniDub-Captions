1
00:00:08,089 --> 00:00:09,693
We don't have enough staff!

2
00:00:09,833 --> 00:00:13,394
Aw, moff! First, it was money, now it's personnel?

3
00:00:13,541 --> 00:00:17,274
But, sir, you only just hired
several new employees a few days ago.

4
00:00:17,299 --> 00:00:20,535
With no consideration for the
cost of paying them all, I might add.

5
00:00:22,454 --> 00:00:26,545
Okay, so we did hire a few more people, but
that was only in that one specialized area.

6
00:00:26,766 --> 00:00:28,402
We just need more in general.

7
00:00:28,622 --> 00:00:31,230
So, you're suggesting that we do some new recruiting?

8
00:00:31,261 --> 00:00:34,727
I'm not so sure about that. Do you
really think we'll get enough applicants?

9
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,475
We won't know until we try.

10
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,445
There might be a whole flock of
beautiful girls just dying to work here.

11
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,257
If that happens, I'll be bowing down in gratitude.

12
00:00:44,062 --> 00:00:47,578
Who knows, one of them might even rival you, Miss Isuzu.

13
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:49,452
Possibly.

14
00:00:49,735 --> 00:00:53,065
But if anyone who applies is more
suited for the position than I am,

15
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,211
I'll gladly surrender my post on the spot.

16
00:00:55,269 --> 00:00:56,815
Uh...

17
00:00:57,467 --> 00:01:00,204
I'm sorry, Miss Isuzu, that was a joke.

18
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,789
Well, anyway, we can start looking tomorrow.

19
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:08,326
That'll be all!

20
00:02:43,113 --> 00:02:45,946
Mr. Kanie!

21
00:02:47,211 --> 00:02:49,046
You need a new secretary?

22
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:50,346
I can do it!

23
00:02:50,452 --> 00:02:52,180
Pick me!

24
00:02:52,384 --> 00:02:53,113
Huh?

25
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,546
You're hired! All of you start immediately!

26
00:02:59,009 --> 00:02:59,880
Wait a minute...

27
00:02:59,905 --> 00:03:02,969
I had a feeling this interview
process would cause some pressure.

28
00:03:03,212 --> 00:03:06,347
So you three just keep on pressuring me, okay?

29
00:03:09,313 --> 00:03:12,546
Stop this right now! It isn't professional!

30
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,742
Oh, hey, Sento. You're still here?

31
00:03:17,885 --> 00:03:19,439
I don't need you anymore.

32
00:03:22,697 --> 00:03:23,470
No!

33
00:03:30,846 --> 00:03:31,840
A dream?

34
00:03:38,741 --> 00:03:40,856
<i>Why would I dream something like that?</i>

35
00:03:41,644 --> 00:03:44,326
You know, I've been through my share of setbacks too.

36
00:03:45,052 --> 00:03:47,413
If it gets us one more visitor, then it's worth it!

37
00:03:47,754 --> 00:03:50,132
I'm ready to do whatever it takes.

38
00:03:50,331 --> 00:03:52,746
I... well, uh...

39
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,402
I couldn't deal with high places, not anymore.

40
00:04:31,401 --> 00:04:34,633
Whoa, I can't believe you actually eat the curry here.

41
00:04:35,306 --> 00:04:36,955
Oh, good morning, Macaron.

42
00:04:37,119 --> 00:04:38,253
Good morning, ron.

43
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:40,620
Don't tell me you really like that garbage.

44
00:04:40,716 --> 00:04:43,825
I don't know, I just felt like
having something else today.

45
00:04:43,854 --> 00:04:46,211
Okay, it's your funeral.

46
00:04:46,276 --> 00:04:50,222
One time, Wanipee-ron exploded
out both ends after eating that junk.

47
00:04:50,247 --> 00:04:51,460
Mind if I sit here?

48
00:04:51,485 --> 00:04:51,958
Sure.

49
00:04:54,976 --> 00:04:57,321
Curry for breakfast is gonna make you fat.

50
00:04:57,555 --> 00:04:59,234
That doesn't really concern me.

51
00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:02,268
And you look like a pathetic
loner when you eat by yourself.

52
00:05:02,293 --> 00:05:04,062
That doesn't concern me either.

53
00:05:04,334 --> 00:05:08,326
Oh, come on, it's almost like
you're being boring on purpose!

54
00:05:08,824 --> 00:05:13,425
You're the kind of person who over-thinks
everything and gets all word-constipated, right?!

55
00:05:15,827 --> 00:05:17,681
That doesn't concern me either.

56
00:05:20,905 --> 00:05:22,799
Look, there's Kanie-ron!

57
00:05:38,063 --> 00:05:39,691
Never mind! That wasn't him.

58
00:05:40,161 --> 00:05:40,818
Oh...

59
00:05:47,467 --> 00:05:48,425
Yes!

60
00:05:52,378 --> 00:05:53,928
Hey, wait up, Sento!

61
00:05:54,591 --> 00:05:56,298
You seem kinda sad today.

62
00:05:56,553 --> 00:05:58,889
Yes, I had a terrible dream,

63
00:05:58,914 --> 00:06:00,688
breakfast tasted disgusting,

64
00:06:00,772 --> 00:06:02,544
my colleague criticized me,

65
00:06:02,804 --> 00:06:05,365
and my job's going as badly as it possibly can.

66
00:06:05,546 --> 00:06:07,446
Oh, wow, that sounds pretty tough.

67
00:06:07,627 --> 00:06:08,655
Of course it is!

68
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,627
And I'm supposed to be assisting Kanie with his work,

69
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:14,130
what if I'm not meeting his expectations?

70
00:06:14,155 --> 00:06:16,273
I'm so afraid he might decide to...

71
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:21,394
Wait, did you say "Kanie"? What's he got to...

72
00:06:21,426 --> 00:06:22,834
What's wrong, Sento?

73
00:06:24,177 --> 00:06:25,162
I have to go!

74
00:06:27,212 --> 00:06:27,900
Whoa!

75
00:06:30,364 --> 00:06:35,536
One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two...

76
00:06:35,624 --> 00:06:37,045
And finish!

77
00:06:39,385 --> 00:06:41,791
Only Sylphy got it right, as usual.

78
00:06:42,058 --> 00:06:43,220
Back to one!

79
00:06:43,292 --> 00:06:44,635
Aww...

80
00:06:45,244 --> 00:06:46,489
No way, mii!

81
00:06:46,514 --> 00:06:49,202
How did you get Isuzu to swallow a ponesty bean?!

82
00:06:49,315 --> 00:06:51,296
I snuck it into her food this morning.

83
00:06:51,421 --> 00:06:53,545
But, Macaron, I only gave you that bean...

84
00:06:53,575 --> 00:06:56,841
because you told me you wanted to find out
how your daughter really feels about you, mii!

85
00:06:57,006 --> 00:07:00,940
I thought you were gonna try to get
custody back from your ex-wife, remember?

86
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,083
Oh yeah, that's still the plan.

87
00:07:03,174 --> 00:07:06,624
But I wanted to test it on Isuzu-ron
first, in case it's dangerous.

88
00:07:06,649 --> 00:07:08,880
Ooh, you ARE bad!

89
00:07:09,356 --> 00:07:13,016
Poor Isuzu must be spilling her
guts all over the place today, mii!

90
00:07:13,543 --> 00:07:17,597
Too bad she went off to school before I
could see what kinda funny stuff it made her say.

91
00:07:17,622 --> 00:07:19,629
Aw man, that's a bummer!

92
00:07:19,992 --> 00:07:21,534
Dude, if it were me,

93
00:07:21,559 --> 00:07:23,692
I would've asked her how many
times a week she slaps the flap!

94
00:07:23,717 --> 00:07:24,970
You're so nasty!

95
00:07:24,995 --> 00:07:26,099
If you asked her something like that,

96
00:07:26,124 --> 00:07:28,251
she'd blow your brains out!

97
00:07:28,797 --> 00:07:30,296
Don't worry about that.

98
00:07:33,442 --> 00:07:36,421
If you want, I'll get it over with right now!

99
00:07:40,077 --> 00:07:41,540
What did you do now?

100
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:48,079
I had to. They slipped me a ponesty bean

101
00:07:48,104 --> 00:07:50,293
so they could ask me inappropriate questions.

102
00:07:50,318 --> 00:07:51,389
Inappropriate?

103
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:53,089
Like how many times a week...

104
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:55,634
Just forget it!

105
00:07:56,604 --> 00:07:58,884
I still don't understand, but whatever.

106
00:07:59,105 --> 00:08:00,964
As soon as you clean up all the bodies,

107
00:08:00,989 --> 00:08:02,590
could you meet me in the administration building?

108
00:08:02,686 --> 00:08:04,385
We're starting the interviews at 1.

109
00:08:05,794 --> 00:08:07,091
I forgot?!

110
00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:09,570
What? Do you have a problem with that?

111
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:11,620
I have several problems with that!

112
00:08:11,719 --> 00:08:13,891
I can't keep from speaking my mind!

113
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:17,344
I'm scared I might accidentally reveal
these strange feelings I have for you-

114
00:08:17,369 --> 00:08:17,896
Ah!

115
00:08:22,763 --> 00:08:23,916
Are you okay there?

116
00:08:23,985 --> 00:08:25,389
Of course I'm not!

117
00:08:25,483 --> 00:08:29,081
Let me call in sick! If I stay
here, you might find out how I feel...

118
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:36,504
You look like you've got plenty of energy to me, Sento.

119
00:08:36,845 --> 00:08:38,803
Anyway, don't be late.

120
00:08:52,898 --> 00:08:56,744
Well, y'see folks, I didn't do so hot in
the mayoral election the other day, so...

121
00:08:56,774 --> 00:09:01,510
I was hoping I could just work here until I find
myself and maybe shoot for prime minister next time.

122
00:09:01,535 --> 00:09:02,668
Good luck with that!

123
00:09:02,891 --> 00:09:04,217
He's so determined.

124
00:09:04,263 --> 00:09:05,468
Yeah, we could hire him.

125
00:09:05,469 --> 00:09:07,369
Are you moffin' serious?!

126
00:09:07,757 --> 00:09:11,303
I figure somebody who's that resilient
is less likely to walk out on us.

127
00:09:11,328 --> 00:09:12,354
Moff...

128
00:09:14,439 --> 00:09:19,436
Why? WHY did I decide to make that
stupid pitch in the very last inning?!

129
00:09:19,461 --> 00:09:21,144
I'm so ashamed!

130
00:09:21,169 --> 00:09:23,632
And how does that make you qualified?

131
00:09:23,657 --> 00:09:26,503
High school athletes DO create some interesting drama.

132
00:09:26,763 --> 00:09:27,402
Okay, let's hire him.

133
00:09:27,427 --> 00:09:28,573
What?!

134
00:09:28,598 --> 00:09:31,382
Cast members are expected to be
entertaining for the guests, right?

135
00:09:31,407 --> 00:09:32,405
Moff...

136
00:09:32,615 --> 00:09:35,936
I was recently fired from my
job as a professional wrestler.

137
00:09:36,219 --> 00:09:38,332
See, I've always been a little sensitive.

138
00:09:38,582 --> 00:09:41,445
So I didn't really like doing
wrestling techniques on people.

139
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:42,969
I mean, I never wanted to hurt anybody.

140
00:09:42,994 --> 00:09:44,760
A wrestler who doesn't wrestle.

141
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:47,418
But Okuro in security is already a masked man.

142
00:09:47,443 --> 00:09:48,444
And we can't have two.

143
00:09:48,469 --> 00:09:50,103
THAT'S what you have a problem with?!

144
00:09:50,306 --> 00:09:52,397
You mean, I don't get the job?

145
00:09:52,635 --> 00:09:54,515
Well, you could take it off.

146
00:09:54,634 --> 00:09:55,684
I refuse!

147
00:09:55,709 --> 00:09:56,401
That was sudden!

148
00:09:56,426 --> 00:09:59,650
Sorry, but you look too similar to a
character we already have on the payroll.

149
00:09:59,675 --> 00:10:02,267
I would rather die than remove my mask!

150
00:10:04,252 --> 00:10:05,924
We need to get Okuro in here.

151
00:10:08,285 --> 00:10:10,043
I thought you couldn't hurt anybody?

152
00:10:11,056 --> 00:10:13,065
His pro-wrestler instincts took over.

153
00:10:13,485 --> 00:10:14,161
Hired.

154
00:10:14,186 --> 00:10:17,744
Didn't know the requirements were
literally just living and breathing.

155
00:10:17,769 --> 00:10:20,871
I told you we were desperate for new hires, stupid rat.

156
00:10:20,896 --> 00:10:22,633
I am the legendary shadow of Iga,

157
00:10:22,658 --> 00:10:25,094
prepared to lay down my life for my lord at any time.

158
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:25,730
Hired.

159
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,356
Earth is mostly water...

160
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,035
Hired!

161
00:10:28,036 --> 00:10:29,810
Hayoooooooooooooo!!

162
00:10:29,835 --> 00:10:30,377
Hired.

163
00:10:30,856 --> 00:10:31,948
Excuse me.

164
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:41,007
My name is Eiko Adachi. Thank you
for taking the time to see me today.

165
00:10:41,971 --> 00:10:43,203
She's normal!

166
00:10:43,228 --> 00:10:45,889
And I was starting to think
all of them would be crazy people.

167
00:10:50,112 --> 00:10:50,804
She...

168
00:10:51,703 --> 00:10:53,263
She was in my dream!

169
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:59,896
Uh, right, let's see, Eiko Adachi...

170
00:11:00,207 --> 00:11:03,212
Oh, it says here you used to work with a talent agency,

171
00:11:03,237 --> 00:11:05,235
and that you've performed in a few films.

172
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:08,216
Can you tell us a little bit about
the kind of movies you've starred in?

173
00:11:08,964 --> 00:11:11,185
Sure! I did AV.

174
00:11:11,451 --> 00:11:12,508
That's pretty cool.

175
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:13,668
Wait, what?

176
00:11:13,669 --> 00:11:14,860
I did AV.

177
00:11:17,463 --> 00:11:18,322
I see...

178
00:11:18,794 --> 00:11:20,670
Uh, did you do a lot of those?

179
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:24,004
Oh, no, I only ever worked on about ten films.

180
00:11:24,029 --> 00:11:25,612
Only ten films?!

181
00:11:25,637 --> 00:11:26,091
Right.

182
00:11:26,116 --> 00:11:26,835
Moff!

183
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:29,640
She did adult video?! Ask for her stage name!

184
00:11:29,665 --> 00:11:31,171
I'm not asking her for that!

185
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,047
For what?

186
00:11:32,072 --> 00:11:33,762
Ah, nothing! Nothing at all!

187
00:11:33,787 --> 00:11:38,046
Sorry about that, we were just a little
surprised by your unusual work history, that's all.

188
00:11:38,071 --> 00:11:40,323
I get that all the time, to tell you the truth.

189
00:11:40,348 --> 00:11:43,123
So please don't worry. I'm used to it by now.

190
00:11:43,338 --> 00:11:45,058
Uh, so glad to hear that...

191
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:48,105
Why are YOU sweating? She's
the one who's getting interviewed!

192
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:51,006
Now hurry up and ask her what her porn name is!

193
00:11:51,031 --> 00:11:52,700
Quit acting like such a creep!

194
00:11:54,936 --> 00:11:56,983
Moff, moff...

195
00:12:00,109 --> 00:12:01,852
S-Sento, what should we do?

196
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:05,912
Do not rely on me for advice today, Kanie!

197
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:07,485
I am a mess right now!

198
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,646
I'm sitting here about to die from shock...

199
00:12:09,671 --> 00:12:12,693
because that woman looks just like the
one from the nightmare I had last night!

200
00:12:12,718 --> 00:12:15,776
And here you are getting all
excited about her adult video career!

201
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:17,674
I understand that she's got bigger breasts than I do,

202
00:12:17,699 --> 00:12:20,592
and that she looks like one of
those mature, comforting types

203
00:12:20,617 --> 00:12:23,157
and that her level of sexual
experience is probably off the charts,

204
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,872
but you don't even know her!

205
00:12:25,223 --> 00:12:27,834
Don't tell me! You're thinking
about making her your new...

206
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:34,037
Uh, Sento?

207
00:12:35,703 --> 00:12:37,264
So, why did you apply?

208
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:40,003
Uh, oh, yeah, good question.

209
00:12:40,028 --> 00:12:42,706
Could you tell us why you're
interested in working at our park?

210
00:12:42,933 --> 00:12:44,772
Well, to be perfectly honest with you,

211
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:46,569
I wasn't very good at my last job.

212
00:12:46,812 --> 00:12:48,707
Although it was satisfying.

213
00:12:48,732 --> 00:12:50,220
Satisfying?!

214
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,818
But then I decided it would be a lot more fulfilling

215
00:12:52,843 --> 00:12:56,278
if I could see it with my own eyes
when the customers enjoy the work I do.

216
00:12:56,682 --> 00:12:59,436
Oh, but that isn't much of a reason, now is it?

217
00:12:59,461 --> 00:13:02,433
Oh, no, I think it's a perfectly good reason actually.

218
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:04,303
So why did she come HERE?

219
00:13:04,397 --> 00:13:05,320
Who cares!

220
00:13:05,716 --> 00:13:06,826
You've been hired.

221
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,769
Thank you very much!

222
00:13:14,073 --> 00:13:15,330
So, what's that about?

223
00:13:15,421 --> 00:13:20,008
Moff, I sent Triken a picture of
Eiko Adachi so he could track her down.

224
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,869
He's kind of a porn expert.

225
00:13:22,255 --> 00:13:24,603
Oh, I see, that's interesting.

226
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:27,204
Anyway, who we got next?

227
00:13:27,383 --> 00:13:28,158
He found it?

228
00:13:28,299 --> 00:13:29,150
Found what?

229
00:13:30,716 --> 00:13:33,312
You know, uh, did he find out the...

230
00:13:33,573 --> 00:13:36,355
Oh, yeah, he figured out her stage name and everything.

231
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:37,948
You're so nasty.

232
00:13:38,408 --> 00:13:38,953
Look...

233
00:13:39,214 --> 00:13:40,567
I'm sorry I'm late!

234
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:42,303
Hi there!

235
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:46,071
My name's Biino Bando. Thank you for seeing me today!

236
00:13:46,547 --> 00:13:48,881
Again?! She was there too!

237
00:13:51,321 --> 00:13:52,758
She seems enthusiasm...

238
00:13:53,495 --> 00:13:54,720
Uh, Ms. Bando?

239
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:55,711
Yes, sir?

240
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:57,037
Are you bleeding?

241
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:00,941
Oh, sorry about that, I was in such a rush.

242
00:14:01,167 --> 00:14:02,284
Are you okay?!

243
00:14:02,619 --> 00:14:03,831
Of course, I'm fine!

244
00:14:03,856 --> 00:14:06,057
It's nothing but a scratch! I promise!

245
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:07,837
Uhhh...

246
00:14:09,812 --> 00:14:12,008
Moff! Looks like a stab wound.

247
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:15,010
I'd say she's lost about a liter's worth of blood so far.

248
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:15,970
She needs help!

249
00:14:16,192 --> 00:14:18,263
No really, I don't need any help.

250
00:14:18,296 --> 00:14:20,999
I'm putting everything on the line for this interview...

251
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:25,316
It's not worth your life! Trust me!

252
00:14:26,313 --> 00:14:28,623
No, I'll die before I give this up...

253
00:14:31,706 --> 00:14:34,201
All right, fine, you're hired! You've got the job!

254
00:14:34,226 --> 00:14:36,688
Now, please let me call an ambulance before you die!

255
00:14:39,764 --> 00:14:40,759
Who is this guy?!

256
00:14:40,784 --> 00:14:42,140
He's my older brother.

257
00:14:42,165 --> 00:14:43,350
Your older brother?!

258
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:46,012
He said he didn't want me to take on a part time job.

259
00:14:46,301 --> 00:14:49,225
He wanted to stop me from coming to the interview so he...

260
00:14:49,492 --> 00:14:50,917
I'm really worried about you...

261
00:14:50,942 --> 00:14:52,419
What do you think we should do with him?

262
00:14:52,444 --> 00:14:53,758
You got the job!

263
00:14:53,783 --> 00:14:54,801
No way!

264
00:14:59,493 --> 00:15:01,193
Hey, control your brother!

265
00:15:05,001 --> 00:15:05,987
Moff!

266
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,070
He's gonna be eating through a tube from now on.

267
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:25,782
I wonder if we're gonna regret hiring that one?

268
00:15:25,807 --> 00:15:26,738
Um...

269
00:15:26,763 --> 00:15:28,536
I think we made the right choice.

270
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:32,662
I know it's not normally rational to hire
someone after an interview goes that badly,

271
00:15:32,687 --> 00:15:34,942
but she had the incredible composure and fortitude...

272
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:37,661
to keep smiling despite having just been stabbed,

273
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,965
and I believe the park could benefit from that.

274
00:15:41,095 --> 00:15:41,798
What's wrong?

275
00:15:41,946 --> 00:15:43,959
Nothing, I think what you're saying makes sense.

276
00:15:44,003 --> 00:15:46,726
But if you're really that good
at deciding what's best for Amabri,

277
00:15:46,751 --> 00:15:49,698
maybe you should take a look at your
own behavior while you're at it, huh?

278
00:15:49,969 --> 00:15:53,043
If only your brain was as big as your boobs.

279
00:15:53,355 --> 00:15:54,610
Now you're both dead!

280
00:15:54,635 --> 00:15:56,212
THAT'S what we're talking about!

281
00:15:58,614 --> 00:15:59,980
Wait a second; Who's that?

282
00:16:00,005 --> 00:16:01,913
E-E-E-Excuse me!

283
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,533
She was in my dream too!

284
00:16:06,624 --> 00:16:09,264
Dream? What the heck is going on with you today?

285
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:11,117
I'm perfectly fine.

286
00:16:11,264 --> 00:16:13,421
Anyway, this is the last applicant.

287
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:16,052
Isn't that the Amagi High uniform?

288
00:16:16,171 --> 00:16:19,192
Y-Yes! M-M-My name's Sh-Sh-Shiina Chujo!

289
00:16:20,657 --> 00:16:24,227
U-um, the reason I wanted
t-t-to work here is b-because I...

290
00:16:24,252 --> 00:16:25,228
Stop panicking!

291
00:16:26,526 --> 00:16:28,119
Ah! I-I'm s-sorry...

292
00:16:28,913 --> 00:16:30,021
So, what do you think?

293
00:16:30,168 --> 00:16:33,924
I think she'll do. We didn't end
up hiring very many girls today.

294
00:16:33,949 --> 00:16:36,548
And she doesn't look like the
type who'd try to seduce you...

295
00:16:40,008 --> 00:16:45,503
Moff, I'm not sure if she'd be okay talking to
guests with a scaredy-cat personality like that.

296
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:47,508
But sure, let's give her a shot.

297
00:16:47,826 --> 00:16:49,994
And here I was expecting you to turn this one down.

298
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:52,383
After all the circus freaks we've seen today,

299
00:16:52,408 --> 00:16:53,990
I don't think I care anymore.

300
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:54,701
Good point.

301
00:16:55,228 --> 00:16:56,566
Well, I guess that settles it then.

302
00:16:56,591 --> 00:16:58,947
Shiina Chujo, welcome aboard.

303
00:16:59,781 --> 00:17:02,883
Th-thank you so much, sir! I appreciate it!

304
00:17:15,555 --> 00:17:16,730
That should be all of it.

305
00:17:28,705 --> 00:17:29,527
Need something?

306
00:17:30,612 --> 00:17:31,692
What you said before...

307
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:32,628
Before?

308
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,417
Macaron said something like that today too.

309
00:17:35,442 --> 00:17:38,441
He says that I over-think things and get tongue-tied.

310
00:17:41,597 --> 00:17:45,231
I've never been very good at
interacting with other people face-to-face.

311
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,348
Hence, the gun.

312
00:17:46,373 --> 00:17:47,158
That's right.

313
00:17:47,183 --> 00:17:50,863
If I'm the one who's in control, then I
can think about the situation logically.

314
00:17:52,487 --> 00:17:55,234
Technically, I criticized your judgment of character,

315
00:17:55,259 --> 00:17:57,155
not your ability to talk to people.

316
00:17:58,814 --> 00:18:01,202
So quit moping around, jeez.

317
00:18:02,032 --> 00:18:04,832
I suppose this is your backhanded way of cheering me up?

318
00:18:04,857 --> 00:18:05,822
Cheering you up?

319
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:07,222
Why would I do that?

320
00:18:10,842 --> 00:18:13,490
I'm envious of you in more ways than one, you know.

321
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:16,979
To me, Kanie, you're very...

322
00:18:17,726 --> 00:18:19,080
Not that again!

323
00:18:19,417 --> 00:18:23,605
Don't feel bad. I can totally understand
you being jealous of my superior genius.

324
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:25,869
Don't you think you ought to do something about the way...

325
00:18:25,894 --> 00:18:28,552
you always talk down to everyone as
though you're better than they are?

326
00:18:29,103 --> 00:18:31,621
But that's the thing. I AM better than everybody else.

327
00:18:31,646 --> 00:18:32,768
What do you expect me to do?

328
00:18:32,793 --> 00:18:36,126
Goddess Libra, please unleash
your wrath on this wretched man.

329
00:18:36,318 --> 00:18:37,228
What did you say?

330
00:18:37,712 --> 00:18:39,046
None of your business.

331
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:41,309
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'd better go.

332
00:18:56,181 --> 00:18:58,627
She was acting like such a weirdo today.

333
00:19:03,241 --> 00:19:03,851
Huh...

334
00:19:11,574 --> 00:19:12,910
What's with that emoji?

335
00:19:13,401 --> 00:19:15,185
What a dumb-ass, ron!

336
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,748
How could anybody mistake this...

337
00:19:17,773 --> 00:19:18,992
for THIS?!

338
00:19:19,114 --> 00:19:22,971
I guess the aspect ratio got moffed
up when I sent Triken that picture.

339
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:25,276
We might as well watch it anyway, mii!

340
00:19:25,301 --> 00:19:26,306
No way!

341
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:27,957
Yeah, not my thing.

342
00:19:27,982 --> 00:19:30,298
Eh, I can dig it.

343
00:19:59,793 --> 00:20:02,108
Aw, look, it's a baby lamb!

344
00:20:02,589 --> 00:20:06,736
It's amazing the way it sucks and sucks
on its mother's nipple for dear life!

345
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:08,826
And look at those kittens!

346
00:20:08,947 --> 00:20:10,966
They love drinking their mother's milk!

347
00:20:11,146 --> 00:20:12,459
Next, we have piglets.

348
00:20:12,565 --> 00:20:15,011
Oh my goodness, they're fighting over their mommy!

349
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,209
Oh, so AV means "animal video".

350
00:20:25,197 --> 00:20:26,597
It's Moffle!

351
00:20:26,622 --> 00:20:27,971
The famous trio!

352
00:20:29,326 --> 00:20:30,884
Shut your pie-holes!

353
00:20:31,308 --> 00:20:33,076
And don't look so happy.

354
00:20:33,418 --> 00:20:35,332
I want you maggots in a straight line!

355
00:20:35,474 --> 00:20:36,841
Listen up, punks!

356
00:20:36,866 --> 00:20:39,953
From this day forward, you are no longer human beings.

357
00:20:39,978 --> 00:20:42,480
You are lower than scum! Do you understand me?!

358
00:20:42,505 --> 00:20:46,647
We're gonna beat you senseless with everything you
need to know about excellent customer service, ron!

359
00:20:46,672 --> 00:20:51,150
There's nothing more satisfying to us than watching
you losers break down and cry after you fail, mii!

360
00:20:51,175 --> 00:20:52,354
Lesson Number One:

361
00:20:52,409 --> 00:20:55,156
The first and last words out of your mouth are "sir!"

362
00:20:55,181 --> 00:20:56,194
You got that?

363
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:58,808
S-Sir! Yes, sir!

364
00:20:59,674 --> 00:21:01,199
I can't hear you!

365
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,773
I want you to say it loud and clear! Say it!

366
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:06,663
Sir, yes, sir!

367
00:21:06,688 --> 00:21:07,516
Not loud enough!

368
00:21:07,944 --> 00:21:09,394
Sir, yes, sir!

369
00:21:10,205 --> 00:21:12,632
You sound like a bunch of wussy little girls!

370
00:21:12,657 --> 00:21:14,589
You better learn to...

371
00:21:14,672 --> 00:21:17,610
Stop scaring them! What's gonna
happen if all of them quit?!

372
00:21:18,351 --> 00:21:19,700
Perfect timing.

373
00:21:19,725 --> 00:21:21,224
I'll make an example outta you!

374
00:21:21,249 --> 00:21:23,982
Somebody needs to cut you down to size, rat face!

375
00:21:27,233 --> 00:21:28,803
No fighting.

376
00:21:30,912 --> 00:21:32,851
Does anyone have questions?

377
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,919
Time for the attractions spotlight.

378
00:23:46,678 --> 00:23:48,595
Today we have Tomb Ranger,

379
00:23:48,628 --> 00:23:50,938
the crowd-favorite attraction of Wild Valley.

380
00:23:51,389 --> 00:23:56,138
Visitors are invited to join Jack Randy
on a Wild West treasure-hunting adventure.

381
00:23:56,336 --> 00:23:58,371
Oh, one of those exploration-type rides.

382
00:23:58,403 --> 00:24:00,417
Those are fun. What's the story like?

383
00:24:00,649 --> 00:24:02,105
You fight pirates.

384
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:03,576
It's set in Japan.

385
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,068
What?

386
00:24:04,172 --> 00:24:06,280
And the treasure is miso rice crackers.

387
00:24:06,376 --> 00:24:08,484
Wait, how is that a Wild West adventure?!
