1
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,503
We're having a soccer match!

2
00:00:16,217 --> 00:00:18,296
Finally lost your moffin' marbles, huh?

3
00:00:18,321 --> 00:00:19,114
No!

4
00:00:19,564 --> 00:00:20,512
Check this out.

5
00:00:24,292 --> 00:00:25,962
You know that stadium to the south?

6
00:00:26,861 --> 00:00:28,520
We'll hold a soccer match there.

7
00:00:28,766 --> 00:00:32,770
That's our only shot at getting
100,000 people in only ten days.

8
00:00:32,891 --> 00:00:35,219
You mean we're hosting a professional match?

9
00:00:35,473 --> 00:00:38,913
That's right... That stadium can hold 50,000 people.

10
00:00:39,413 --> 00:00:41,328
This is the perfect chance to use it.

11
00:00:41,645 --> 00:00:44,145
As I'm sure some of you have already surmised,

12
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:49,068
going by the current rate, it's impossible
to reach half a million visitors by July 31st.

13
00:00:49,302 --> 00:00:52,716
But if we account for the projected
number of soccer spectators...

14
00:00:54,949 --> 00:00:55,552
Triken!

15
00:00:55,919 --> 00:00:58,594
SIR! As per the acting manager's orders...

16
00:00:58,619 --> 00:01:00,094
secretly I might add...

17
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:03,368
... I've been conducting research for quite some time now.

18
00:01:04,426 --> 00:01:07,310
I followed the few leads I had all across Japan,

19
00:01:07,335 --> 00:01:09,692
to the north, south, east, and west.

20
00:01:09,717 --> 00:01:12,711
Oh yes, I went to such great
pains during this whole process...

21
00:01:12,743 --> 00:01:15,359
that I only wish I could bow to myself in recogniti...

22
00:01:15,877 --> 00:01:17,431
Hurry and get to the point.

23
00:01:17,456 --> 00:01:19,736
But Miss Isuzu, I was up all night preparing...

24
00:01:19,761 --> 00:01:20,625
What's that?

25
00:02:52,655 --> 00:02:57,115
Basically, I wanted an event that would make
use of the stadium and bring in more guests...

26
00:02:57,271 --> 00:02:59,996
I was actually on the lookout for a long time until now.

27
00:03:00,191 --> 00:03:02,491
I had no idea you were up to something.

28
00:03:02,679 --> 00:03:05,390
I didn't think there was much chance of finding anything.

29
00:03:05,503 --> 00:03:06,703
However...!

30
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:10,444
Last night I received a positive
response from one of my contacts.

31
00:03:10,798 --> 00:03:14,813
This is the home stadium of
Division One team Grandira Tokyo.

32
00:03:15,415 --> 00:03:18,342
The turf is ragged, so it's scheduled for refurbishing...

33
00:03:19,447 --> 00:03:23,179
but it's taking them too long which means
that the venue won't be ready in time...

34
00:03:23,204 --> 00:03:25,531
for the commemorative match on July 31st.

35
00:03:25,556 --> 00:03:27,190
July 31st, huh?

36
00:03:27,259 --> 00:03:31,584
That's the date the team was founded, so
they were hoping to hold the match on that day.

37
00:03:32,288 --> 00:03:34,871
From what we understand, the
annual match between the current...

38
00:03:34,896 --> 00:03:38,974
and retired champion teams
tends to attract about 50,000 fans.

39
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:44,060
As you might've guessed, they're
in a hurry to find another venue.

40
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:46,562
So we'll invite them to come here.

41
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:47,927
But, sir...

42
00:03:47,952 --> 00:03:52,486
I assume we would need to have some kind of special
license to host a professional match, wouldn't we?

43
00:03:52,692 --> 00:03:54,926
I don't think it's going to be an official game.

44
00:03:55,007 --> 00:03:57,348
I'm sure it'll work out if we negotiate properly.

45
00:03:57,753 --> 00:03:59,797
We'll tell you more after we discuss it with them.

46
00:04:00,135 --> 00:04:02,362
We're gonna be busy if it happens.

47
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:03,912
So you'd better be ready!

48
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:13,169
Are you sure you'd like ME to act
as Amabri's main representative, sir?

49
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:17,131
They won't take us seriously with
a high school student in charge.

50
00:04:17,976 --> 00:04:20,748
Hey, Triken. Did you bring that Rarapazzi thing?

51
00:04:20,845 --> 00:04:25,270
Of course. As long as I have this
they won't even care that I'm a dinosaur.

52
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:28,471
One question.

53
00:04:28,626 --> 00:04:29,178
Hm?

54
00:04:29,342 --> 00:04:30,924
Tell me honestly please...

55
00:04:31,013 --> 00:04:33,410
How much of a chance do you think we have?

56
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:36,400
I just don't know.

57
00:04:44,212 --> 00:04:46,088
It looks like it's the right size.

58
00:04:46,113 --> 00:04:47,480
We'll have to see the turf.

59
00:04:50,366 --> 00:04:51,832
What do you think, sirs?

60
00:04:51,857 --> 00:04:55,848
I'm confident that the capacity of the
stadium will be enough to meet your needs.

61
00:04:55,948 --> 00:04:59,640
From the looks of it, the building
was established quite a long time ago.

62
00:04:59,665 --> 00:05:00,699
Ah yes...

63
00:05:00,724 --> 00:05:02,889
I‐it's about 20 years old.

64
00:05:02,914 --> 00:05:05,613
I understand the space hasn't been used much but...

65
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,798
what kind of regular maintenance have you been doing?

66
00:05:07,823 --> 00:05:10,278
Um... Well, let me consult my notes here...

67
00:05:10,303 --> 00:05:12,182
What about access from the train station?

68
00:05:12,207 --> 00:05:14,665
How will you manage 50,000 patrons?

69
00:05:15,411 --> 00:05:18,613
Um, I‐I was thinking hard work
and determination would suffice...

70
00:05:18,638 --> 00:05:20,798
But the most crucial issue here is the turf...

71
00:05:20,848 --> 00:05:23,585
It has to be all‐natural and perfectly maintained...

72
00:05:23,689 --> 00:05:25,683
Without that, there can be no match.

73
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,351
But I'm sure you know that.

74
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,720
Yes of course I know that...

75
00:05:29,745 --> 00:05:32,084
The turf is very important... I know.

76
00:05:32,257 --> 00:05:33,286
No, you didn't.

77
00:05:33,425 --> 00:05:37,139
My concern is that it's a multipurpose
stadium instead of a sports stadium.

78
00:05:37,615 --> 00:05:39,897
Could you tell us more about the turf maintenance?

79
00:05:41,131 --> 00:05:45,782
Ah, actually I'm only the Chief of Sales,
so I wouldn't know the details, sir...

80
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:51,015
Well then, I appreciate you all taking
the time to come speak with us today.

81
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,120
I think we've heard enough for now.

82
00:05:54,306 --> 00:05:56,517
We'll get back to you with a final decision in a few days.

83
00:05:56,542 --> 00:05:58,091
Wait! Please wait a moment!

84
00:05:58,116 --> 00:06:01,491
I urge you to look over our
proposal one more time, please!

85
00:06:01,523 --> 00:06:03,031
It would mean a lot!

86
00:06:04,161 --> 00:06:06,678
First off... you asked us about maintenance?

87
00:06:07,357 --> 00:06:11,789
The park employees are very dedicated to
keeping the stadium in top-notch condition.

88
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:13,352
We could do it tomorrow if you wanted.

89
00:06:14,296 --> 00:06:15,196
Oh?

90
00:06:15,221 --> 00:06:16,913
Then the matter of accessibility.

91
00:06:17,163 --> 00:06:21,063
We'd be glad to ask a local bus
company to allocate some shuttle buses.

92
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:24,610
And our parking lot has enough space for 5,000 cars.

93
00:06:27,142 --> 00:06:30,293
And we actually have a specialist
on site who takes care of the turf.

94
00:06:30,485 --> 00:06:34,572
It's immaculately kept and 100%
natural, so there's no need to worry.

95
00:06:35,524 --> 00:06:36,773
I'm not so sure.

96
00:06:36,857 --> 00:06:39,057
I invite you to come see for yourselves...

97
00:06:39,082 --> 00:06:40,373
You won't be disappointed.

98
00:06:41,895 --> 00:06:42,463
Huh...

99
00:06:43,115 --> 00:06:45,131
That's all well and good, but...

100
00:06:45,156 --> 00:06:48,635
We'd rather not work with a venue with no experience.

101
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:53,491
<i>Honestly, the main issue is how much this'll cost us.</i>

102
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:58,101
<i>With all the salary increases,
we're struggling to stay afloat.</i>

103
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,345
<i>We can't afford this.</i>

104
00:07:01,659 --> 00:07:04,510
<i>We couldn't even afford to finish the turf replacement.</i>

105
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:08,917
<i>I'm starting to doubt that we'll be
able to pay all the bills this month.</i>

106
00:07:10,426 --> 00:07:15,244
<i>We need to talk the price down as much as
possible without divulging our financial problem.</i>

107
00:07:16,012 --> 00:07:18,142
Oh, that's right. I forgot to mention something.

108
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,334
I've discussed this with the rest of our team...

109
00:07:20,381 --> 00:07:24,799
and we've decided we'd like to waive the fees
and allow you to use the stadium free of charge.

110
00:07:24,952 --> 00:07:26,207
No charge?!

111
00:07:26,935 --> 00:07:28,177
That's not all, either...

112
00:07:28,413 --> 00:07:34,164
We recognize bus rentals, security personnel,
advertising, and ticket printing can be expensive,

113
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:38,300
so we're prepared to cover a portion of
those costs as well if that's alright with you.

114
00:07:38,411 --> 00:07:40,784
Y‐you're offering to pay US money?!

115
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:41,574
That's right...

116
00:07:41,677 --> 00:07:45,624
In other words, Amagi Brilliant Park is
asking to participate as a sort of sponsor.

117
00:07:45,743 --> 00:07:48,793
A‐are you sure we can promise that, Mr. Kanie?

118
00:07:48,826 --> 00:07:52,935
Well, then we'd be interested in hearing what
kind of numbers you have in mind specifically.

119
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:54,259
Hm...

120
00:07:56,552 --> 00:07:57,860
I think this is reasonable.

121
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:01,847
That sound about right?

122
00:08:01,872 --> 00:08:05,382
W‐wait a minute, are you sure that
isn't some kind of gross miscalculation?

123
00:08:05,797 --> 00:08:07,282
Absolutely positive...

124
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:10,507
These instructions come directly from the manager herself.

125
00:08:12,089 --> 00:08:13,916
It still seems a little high...

126
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:17,156
Of course it's extremely appealing to us, but...

127
00:08:17,181 --> 00:08:19,565
Aren't you going to suffer a serious loss?

128
00:08:20,007 --> 00:08:23,266
I assure you gentlemen, our manager
is in full support of the sponsorship...

129
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,720
as long as it serves to bring in some new customers.

130
00:08:25,745 --> 00:08:29,551
She'd like us to host these soccer fans
regardless of how much it costs the park.

131
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:31,268
That's exactly what she said.

132
00:08:34,174 --> 00:08:36,138
We do have one small request, though.

133
00:08:36,668 --> 00:08:37,661
And what's that?

134
00:08:38,225 --> 00:08:41,813
We'd like all the spectators to
go in through the park's main gate.

135
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:47,064
Of course, if they have a soccer ticket, they'll
be granted the free admission to the park as well.

136
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,050
Why would you want to do that?

137
00:08:49,075 --> 00:08:52,269
It looks like the stadium has its
own separate entrance, doesn't it?

138
00:08:52,427 --> 00:08:54,564
It's too complicated to explain that...

139
00:08:54,589 --> 00:08:58,172
but I'm afraid this particular
request is absolutely nonnegotiable.

140
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:01,651
Well, I don't see any reason to take issue with that.

141
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,161
What do you say, gentlemen?

142
00:09:04,931 --> 00:09:06,720
Why don't you come pay us a visit soon?

143
00:09:06,935 --> 00:09:09,810
That way you can approve the facility for yourselves.

144
00:09:10,935 --> 00:09:12,795
Are you sure that was wise?

145
00:09:12,829 --> 00:09:14,967
Promising to pay the expenses as well?

146
00:09:14,992 --> 00:09:18,725
You must be well aware of
Amabri's financial situation, yes?

147
00:09:18,882 --> 00:09:19,971
I have a plan.

148
00:09:20,464 --> 00:09:21,241
Trust me.

149
00:09:24,114 --> 00:09:25,957
What about the turf maintenance?

150
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,765
I'm not familiar with any "specialist".

151
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:30,126
What better landscaper than a flower fairy?

152
00:09:30,461 --> 00:09:32,023
He's got quite the green thumb.

153
00:09:35,943 --> 00:09:37,022
Alright!

154
00:09:37,047 --> 00:09:38,977
Just leave everything to mii!

155
00:09:42,891 --> 00:09:44,713
Mii!

156
00:09:47,597 --> 00:09:49,664
Killer plaaant!

157
00:09:53,651 --> 00:09:55,683
I was expecting something like that.

158
00:09:55,778 --> 00:09:57,243
Are you guys ready?

159
00:09:57,684 --> 00:09:59,513
Take it down!

160
00:10:08,948 --> 00:10:10,868
Crisis averted, boss!

161
00:10:11,462 --> 00:10:12,592
That's wonderful.

162
00:10:12,861 --> 00:10:13,543
Yeah.

163
00:10:14,222 --> 00:10:15,481
This oughta do the trick.

164
00:10:54,082 --> 00:10:55,957
The turf is what really sold us!

165
00:10:55,982 --> 00:10:59,078
I only wish I could convince
you all to tell us your secret.

166
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:00,984
Everything's not exactly perfect...

167
00:11:01,302 --> 00:11:03,482
but we can iron out the details later on.

168
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:09,127
There's not much time to prepare, but working together,
I think we'll be able to pull this off quite nicely.

169
00:11:09,815 --> 00:11:11,438
I do appreciate that, sir...

170
00:11:11,549 --> 00:11:13,314
We'll do everything we can to help out.

171
00:11:13,424 --> 00:11:16,102
We respectfully bow to you fine gentlemen.

172
00:11:16,158 --> 00:11:17,477
Thank you so much...

173
00:11:17,502 --> 00:11:19,578
We look forward to working with you as well.

174
00:11:23,485 --> 00:11:25,202
That was nerve‐wracking.

175
00:11:25,321 --> 00:11:30,482
Sento... tell everybody to gather on the roof of
Maple Castle as soon as the park closes tonight...

176
00:11:30,615 --> 00:11:31,985
I'm breaking the news.

177
00:11:32,144 --> 00:11:32,993
I'll do that.

178
00:11:34,449 --> 00:11:35,829
What news is that?

179
00:11:42,815 --> 00:11:43,981
Attention!

180
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:47,425
I have something I need to tell you.

181
00:11:50,697 --> 00:11:51,951
It's important.

182
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,517
We're selling off the south area!

183
00:12:02,557 --> 00:12:06,033
Y‐you say the south area's gonna be sold‐mii?

184
00:12:06,495 --> 00:12:07,128
Right.

185
00:12:07,703 --> 00:12:09,057
It's not up for discussion.

186
00:12:10,455 --> 00:12:12,471
I was looking for a buyer for a while...

187
00:12:13,463 --> 00:12:15,546
...and the other day I finally found one.

188
00:12:17,702 --> 00:12:20,876
The money we make from that should
take care of our financial issue...

189
00:12:21,773 --> 00:12:23,413
I'm sure you all understand.

190
00:12:24,273 --> 00:12:27,336
Heh, there ya go droppin' another bomb on us.

191
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:31,547
But Mr. Kanie, the southern area's
almost as big as the main section!

192
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:32,268
You can't...

193
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,806
I can and I will.

194
00:12:34,607 --> 00:12:37,824
I always thought Amabri would
get back on its feet one day...

195
00:12:37,849 --> 00:12:40,794
and maybe we could build some
nice attractions over in that area.

196
00:12:40,819 --> 00:12:43,116
Me too, I figured that was the plan.

197
00:12:43,274 --> 00:12:47,413
Yeah, if we could've expanded, it would've
really put Amabri on the map once and for all.

198
00:12:47,612 --> 00:12:49,727
None of that stuff is ever gonna happen!

199
00:12:49,949 --> 00:12:52,443
Not before this park runs itself into the ground!

200
00:12:52,468 --> 00:12:56,066
If we have to cut off a limb to
survive, then that's exactly what we'll do!

201
00:12:56,956 --> 00:12:59,633
We can't afford to think about what happens after this.

202
00:13:01,743 --> 00:13:02,351
Okay.

203
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:02,980
Huh?

204
00:13:03,207 --> 00:13:05,840
Maybe it's not such a bad idea‐ y'know?

205
00:13:06,189 --> 00:13:07,443
Mr. Moffle...

206
00:13:10,646 --> 00:13:14,697
That's true, maybe hanging onto land
we're not using is kind of a waste‐ron.

207
00:13:14,757 --> 00:13:15,840
Fair enough...

208
00:13:15,865 --> 00:13:17,653
Guess I'm on board‐mii.

209
00:13:18,069 --> 00:13:21,427
It does make a lot of sense from
an accounting perspective as well...

210
00:13:21,585 --> 00:13:23,862
It's better if we can solve everything at once.

211
00:13:24,256 --> 00:13:28,498
Maybe you're right... I just think it'll
be sad to give up half of the property.

212
00:13:28,697 --> 00:13:31,008
I know, but it's for the good of the park.

213
00:13:31,167 --> 00:13:33,884
Sounds like the best way for
us to keep working together...

214
00:13:34,011 --> 00:13:35,617
so I can't really complain.

215
00:13:36,614 --> 00:13:39,555
You can't make an omelet without breaking eggs!

216
00:13:43,473 --> 00:13:45,921
Right! Lose the battle, win the war!

217
00:13:47,104 --> 00:13:47,620
Good!

218
00:13:47,973 --> 00:13:49,804
That's all I needed to tell you.

219
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:53,269
We've got 9 days left, and there's still a lot to do!

220
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:57,002
Starting tonight, nobody's going home or taking days off!

221
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,682
Now get to work, everyone!

222
00:13:59,986 --> 00:14:02,071
YEAH!

223
00:14:48,374 --> 00:14:50,064
How are the preparations going?

224
00:14:50,921 --> 00:14:54,003
Well, I can't say it's a walk in
the park, but I think we can manage it.

225
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,432
That's wonderful to hear, Sir Kanie.

226
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:58,615
I'm uh... sorry.

227
00:14:58,940 --> 00:14:59,705
About what?

228
00:15:00,173 --> 00:15:03,294
About my decision I made to sell
almost half of the park property.

229
00:15:03,437 --> 00:15:05,381
I know I discussed it with you before hand...

230
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,149
but I'm sorry it had to happen.

231
00:15:08,466 --> 00:15:10,272
How many times must I say it?

232
00:15:10,446 --> 00:15:13,099
You are the manager of our precious park, Sir Kanie.

233
00:15:13,393 --> 00:15:15,830
We trust you to serve its best interest.

234
00:15:17,494 --> 00:15:20,295
More importantly, isn't there something I can do to help?

235
00:15:20,534 --> 00:15:24,552
I feel terrible sitting here doing nothing
while you're all working so diligently.

236
00:15:24,987 --> 00:15:27,108
For now, your job is to get some rest...

237
00:15:27,205 --> 00:15:29,159
So don't worry about anything else.

238
00:15:29,357 --> 00:15:30,217
I don't know...

239
00:15:30,423 --> 00:15:33,370
What? Now you can't follow the acting manager's orders?

240
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:35,252
Very well then.

241
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,833
Just sit back and relax.

242
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:40,416
I mean... think about how much better
this place is doing lately all because of me.

243
00:15:40,637 --> 00:15:42,695
And once we get to August, it'll be even bet...

244
00:15:44,832 --> 00:15:46,596
Oh wait... the first of August...

245
00:15:46,827 --> 00:15:49,316
That's when you're gonna lose
all your memories again, isn't it?

246
00:15:50,014 --> 00:15:51,578
Even if the park stays open.

247
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:53,937
Please don't let it trouble you.

248
00:15:54,548 --> 00:15:56,767
It's just something that happens every year.

249
00:15:57,124 --> 00:16:00,803
I can't believe you've been living your
life this way for such a long time now.

250
00:16:01,031 --> 00:16:04,851
Yes... At the stroke of midnight
on the first day of August...

251
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:08,700
my physical body as well as my
memories are set back by a year.

252
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:12,301
My uncle explained the situation
to me when it happened the last time.

253
00:16:12,492 --> 00:16:16,358
The reason I'm here... and what's happened up until now.

254
00:16:18,163 --> 00:16:22,342
I'm sure I must have met the Digerry
Clan and Sir Rubrum at some point as well...

255
00:16:23,096 --> 00:16:25,186
but I don't have any memory of that.

256
00:16:25,741 --> 00:16:26,440
Oh.

257
00:16:26,884 --> 00:16:29,246
But I know that as long as this park exists,

258
00:16:29,271 --> 00:16:30,707
I'll always be here.

259
00:16:30,787 --> 00:16:32,471
Always and forever.

260
00:16:34,903 --> 00:16:36,007
So please...

261
00:16:36,404 --> 00:16:40,114
Come back and visit me whenever you
can, even after you finish working here.

262
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:43,095
For some odd reason I never forget how to make croquettes.

263
00:16:43,467 --> 00:16:46,058
Okay... I do like your croquettes.

264
00:16:46,553 --> 00:16:49,649
Right! We can ride the Ferris wheel again too!

265
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:51,579
Ah! Uh, maybe not that.

266
00:16:51,722 --> 00:16:52,849
Oh, I forgot!

267
00:16:52,874 --> 00:16:53,739
I'm sorry.

268
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:01,193
Hey there, it's been a while.

269
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,347
You know, you're always barging in.

270
00:17:04,672 --> 00:17:07,152
I just came to check the old visitor counter.

271
00:17:07,364 --> 00:17:09,707
Not giving up, that's sweet.

272
00:17:10,465 --> 00:17:12,950
Yeah, I think we'll just barely make 500,000.

273
00:17:13,649 --> 00:17:18,161
Just to make this clear... the contract
deadline is at closing time on the last day,

274
00:17:18,186 --> 00:17:19,766
which is 9 o'clock sharp.

275
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:22,899
No extensions allowed... Please remember that.

276
00:17:23,153 --> 00:17:25,505
Well the soccer match kicks off at 6 PM...

277
00:17:25,561 --> 00:17:27,523
So there's nothing to worry about.

278
00:17:27,856 --> 00:17:30,271
I'll send one of my staff the day of...

279
00:17:30,509 --> 00:17:32,678
July 31st at 9 P. M.

280
00:17:34,903 --> 00:17:36,585
I'll be looking forward to it.

281
00:18:04,376 --> 00:18:06,455
Kanie... It's time to go.

282
00:18:06,828 --> 00:18:07,336
Right.

283
00:18:08,772 --> 00:18:10,481
Unlock the gate!

284
00:18:10,902 --> 00:18:12,211
We're open!

285
00:18:23,472 --> 00:18:24,442
Oh my, they're lovely!

286
00:18:24,466 --> 00:18:25,206
How did he do that?

287
00:18:25,231 --> 00:18:27,439
Ro‐Ron! Ron ron...

288
00:18:28,368 --> 00:18:29,709
Keep our planet clean!

289
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:33,140
Over here. Look at me so I can
take your picture with the ferret guy!

290
00:18:34,556 --> 00:18:35,581
Hey guys!

291
00:18:35,606 --> 00:18:36,728
Ready?

292
00:18:39,939 --> 00:18:41,594
That's awesome!

293
00:18:41,619 --> 00:18:44,175
We sure hope all of you enjoy the show today!

294
00:18:52,688 --> 00:18:54,394
The numbers really are climbing up.

295
00:18:54,704 --> 00:18:56,656
Yeah, I'm pretty sure we'll get even more.

296
00:18:56,826 --> 00:18:57,921
We have to get more.

297
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:13,747
Current wait time is 20 minutes!

298
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:17,113
I repeat, the current wait time is 20 minutes!

299
00:19:19,066 --> 00:19:20,055
Miii!!!

300
00:19:20,252 --> 00:19:22,103
Aw, he's so cute!

301
00:19:22,191 --> 00:19:25,925
Mii! Mii! Mii‐heehee!

302
00:19:26,856 --> 00:19:29,129
Jeez, when's it gonna be over...

303
00:19:29,184 --> 00:19:30,806
Mommy! It's Tiramy!

304
00:19:30,831 --> 00:19:32,353
Another one?!

305
00:19:32,528 --> 00:19:36,199
ENCORE ENCORE...

306
00:19:36,224 --> 00:19:38,599
How many encores do they want from me‐ron?

307
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:43,404
Moff! All units follow me!

308
00:19:48,195 --> 00:19:49,223
Hyahhhh!

309
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,639
I'm sorry, we're full!

310
00:19:51,664 --> 00:19:54,020
but please feel free to wait for the next showtime!

311
00:19:55,790 --> 00:20:03,361
I need 2 carbonaras, an order of hotcakes, 3 udon
bowls, and what was that other thing... 2 bowls of ramen!

312
00:20:03,394 --> 00:20:06,875
W‐w‐wait a minute, there's
no way I can remember all thaaat!

313
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,101
Hey Shiina! We're running low on meat again!

314
00:20:09,164 --> 00:20:11,095
Go pick some up from that store pronto!

315
00:20:11,186 --> 00:20:12,005
Not again!

316
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:13,772
Go ahead and get as much as you can carry!

317
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:16,370
We're gonna need at least 200 pounds of it this time!

318
00:20:18,872 --> 00:20:20,605
We don't have enough personnel!

319
00:20:20,707 --> 00:20:23,956
Send some backup to the Lost Child Center ASAP!

320
00:20:23,981 --> 00:20:27,439
Ugh, I'm so exhausted.

321
00:20:27,722 --> 00:20:31,107
I've never even seen this many
people at comic conventions.

322
00:20:31,806 --> 00:20:34,213
This has gotta be some kind of park record.

323
00:20:34,262 --> 00:20:36,563
I can't feel my feet, mii.

324
00:20:36,882 --> 00:20:39,083
Sure wish a nice girl would give me a massage.

325
00:20:39,108 --> 00:20:40,927
Sorry! That's never gonna happen.

326
00:20:40,952 --> 00:20:43,559
It's only gonna get busier in the afternoon.

327
00:20:43,964 --> 00:20:46,130
We'll just have to stick it out.

328
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,879
It's time for the special event...

329
00:20:49,904 --> 00:20:52,472
All cast members please be on standby.

330
00:20:52,686 --> 00:20:53,797
Already?!

331
00:21:16,793 --> 00:21:17,768
Come on dad!

332
00:21:17,802 --> 00:21:19,271
It's almost time!

333
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,747
Slow down buddy, we'll get there.

334
00:21:27,539 --> 00:21:31,629
Someday we'll be this crowded
without the help of some soccer match.

335
00:21:32,584 --> 00:21:33,244
Yeah.

336
00:21:35,415 --> 00:21:36,428
It's over there!

337
00:21:36,492 --> 00:21:37,853
Sweet, let's go!

338
00:21:37,933 --> 00:21:41,084
The people who came in on the
last bus just went through the gate.

339
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:46,679
Kanie!

340
00:22:03,275 --> 00:22:04,322
We fell short.

341
00:23:42,594 --> 00:23:44,951
Time for the attractions spotlight.

342
00:23:45,729 --> 00:23:47,935
Today's feature is Fisherman's Dive.

343
00:23:48,252 --> 00:23:49,610
Is this really necessary?

344
00:23:49,698 --> 00:23:51,509
The park might be about to shut down.

345
00:23:51,628 --> 00:23:53,607
That's exactly why it's important.

346
00:23:53,821 --> 00:23:54,569
Fine.

347
00:23:55,275 --> 00:23:56,831
So, what's Fisherman's Dive?

348
00:23:57,458 --> 00:24:02,076
A coaster ride in Splash Ocean,
based on Hemingway's famous masterpiece.

349
00:24:02,765 --> 00:24:07,451
Visitors struggle desperately to catch an
impressive marlin only to be thwarted by sharks.

350
00:24:07,722 --> 00:24:08,952
That's not fun!
