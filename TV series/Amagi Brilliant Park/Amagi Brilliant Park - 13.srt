1
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:17,989
Come meet the lovable mascot characters
from Maple Land, the kingdom of dreams!

2
00:00:18,108 --> 00:00:20,365
Where fairy tales come to life!

3
00:00:22,934 --> 00:00:25,343
With so many great attractions...

4
00:00:26,048 --> 00:00:28,925
there's always something fun for the whole family!

5
00:00:31,646 --> 00:00:34,092
The memories will last a lifetime.

6
00:00:48,594 --> 00:00:51,853
So plan your visit to Amagi Brilliant Park today!

7
00:00:56,231 --> 00:00:57,766
So what do you think of it?

8
00:00:57,897 --> 00:01:02,535
I wanted this promotional video to be perfect
so I poured my blood sweat and tears into it.

9
00:01:02,783 --> 00:01:06,159
It's okay... Not bad, but not good either.

10
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:08,574
Actually, the whole thing is pretty bland.

11
00:01:08,798 --> 00:01:10,132
So you don't like it?

12
00:01:10,157 --> 00:01:11,429
No, not at all...

13
00:01:11,893 --> 00:01:15,759
It looks like you created a visual
representation of your boring personality.

14
00:01:17,097 --> 00:01:18,371
I see this happen a lot.

15
00:01:19,308 --> 00:01:22,389
All the fundamentals are there,
but it still puts me to sleep.

16
00:01:23,885 --> 00:01:28,061
To be totally frank, the product is boring
because the person who made it is boring.

17
00:01:29,078 --> 00:01:29,790
You get it?

18
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:32,607
And he wonders why he has no friends.

19
00:01:32,632 --> 00:01:33,888
Did you say something to me?

20
00:01:33,912 --> 00:01:34,765
Not at all!

21
00:01:35,015 --> 00:01:36,497
Here's the thing, Triken,

22
00:01:36,553 --> 00:01:39,523
I am way too busy to hold your
hand through all of this today.

23
00:01:39,867 --> 00:01:40,542
Sento.

24
00:01:40,876 --> 00:01:41,656
Yes?

25
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:43,190
You were listening, weren't you?

26
00:01:43,868 --> 00:01:45,623
Tell Triken what he needs to do.

27
00:01:46,132 --> 00:01:47,974
Well alright... but to be fair,

28
00:01:47,999 --> 00:01:50,179
I don't know anything about making videos.

29
00:01:50,422 --> 00:01:52,315
Yeah, but two heads are better than one.

30
00:01:53,585 --> 00:01:54,489
Understood.

31
00:01:54,703 --> 00:01:57,667
It might be smart to ask the
other workers for their input too...

32
00:01:57,954 --> 00:02:00,472
I'll look over the final product
when you're finished it up.

33
00:02:00,665 --> 00:02:02,401
Thank you for your assistance!

34
00:02:02,481 --> 00:02:05,844
Excuse me... It's time to hunch over and work!

35
00:03:36,772 --> 00:03:40,088
PV... "Promotional video" is that right?

36
00:03:40,204 --> 00:03:42,604
Unfortunately, as I told you before...

37
00:03:42,711 --> 00:03:44,714
I don't know the first thing about this.

38
00:03:44,992 --> 00:03:48,278
I don't understand what makes the video so unsatisfactory.

39
00:03:48,378 --> 00:03:51,111
But I do agree with Kanie that something's not right.

40
00:03:51,316 --> 00:03:53,178
Oh, so you think so too.

41
00:03:53,484 --> 00:03:58,678
I believe the logical first step is to follow his
advice and gather input from the rest of the cast.

42
00:03:58,768 --> 00:04:01,358
Input? What do you mean "input"?

43
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:04,098
Why don't we go see what our star mascots think?

44
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:09,772
Moff, this is no good at all.

45
00:04:09,907 --> 00:04:11,647
You didn't like it either.

46
00:04:11,711 --> 00:04:14,679
How do I describe it? Too plain?

47
00:04:14,775 --> 00:04:16,129
This happens a lot.

48
00:04:16,826 --> 00:04:20,238
All the fundamentals are there
but it still puts me to sleep.

49
00:04:20,597 --> 00:04:25,002
It's like you've created a visual
representation of your boring personality.

50
00:04:25,027 --> 00:04:27,578
He just said exactly what Mr. Kanie said...

51
00:04:27,659 --> 00:04:28,925
They're BOTH terrible.

52
00:04:29,393 --> 00:04:30,888
Did you say something?

53
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,861
Not at all!

54
00:04:32,257 --> 00:04:36,290
If I had to pick out the biggest
problem, I'd say it needs more action.

55
00:04:36,572 --> 00:04:40,818
Like the fireworks at the
beginning... explosions would be better.

56
00:04:40,956 --> 00:04:43,280
Did... you say explosions?

57
00:04:43,305 --> 00:04:46,783
All you need is a bit of gasoline and then MOFF!

58
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:51,968
Get a shot of somebody running past a bunch
of explosions and jumping straight off a cliff!

59
00:04:51,993 --> 00:04:55,753
Then at the end you see the park
logo in front of the aftermath!

60
00:04:55,915 --> 00:04:57,586
Are you sure that's wise?

61
00:04:57,642 --> 00:04:59,666
This park's supposed to be family-friendly.

62
00:04:59,709 --> 00:05:01,178
Don't think about too much.

63
00:05:01,203 --> 00:05:03,483
Let's just try it and see what happens!

64
00:05:23,491 --> 00:05:24,142
Moff.

65
00:05:40,294 --> 00:05:41,139
Ron!

66
00:06:00,303 --> 00:06:01,470
Heheh...

67
00:06:04,305 --> 00:06:05,902
Is this any better?

68
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,106
Let's see... I can't say for certain...

69
00:06:09,317 --> 00:06:10,453
but I think so.

70
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:12,226
Oh...! That's surprising.

71
00:06:12,318 --> 00:06:15,130
For one... it's definitely not boring now.

72
00:06:15,202 --> 00:06:18,125
And the explosion scenes are especially convincing.

73
00:06:18,437 --> 00:06:20,587
You should proceed along these lines.

74
00:06:20,691 --> 00:06:24,076
Yes Miss Isuzu... I'll see what else we can add to it.

75
00:06:25,444 --> 00:06:26,544
Hmm...

76
00:06:27,641 --> 00:06:33,205
This is okay I guess but doesn't tell the audience about
the kind of music I perform at the music theater-ron.

77
00:06:33,504 --> 00:06:34,602
Oh, I see.

78
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:39,483
If you ask me, the visuals AND the soundtrack
could benefit from a more "aggressive" tone.

79
00:06:39,508 --> 00:06:41,740
What do you mean by "aggressive"?

80
00:06:43,067 --> 00:06:45,690
I'm thinkin' you gotta crank up the libido-mii!

81
00:06:45,721 --> 00:06:47,521
Uh... libido as in sex drive...?

82
00:06:47,546 --> 00:06:49,419
That's right. You know what I'm talking about.

83
00:06:49,444 --> 00:06:52,076
To put it in simple terms I think we need to go lewder.

84
00:06:52,101 --> 00:06:54,233
Lewdness?! Now THAT I understand!

85
00:06:54,287 --> 00:06:56,581
Swimsuits! Short skirts! Low angles!

86
00:06:56,606 --> 00:07:00,744
All you gotta do is squeeze in as much
fanservice as you can legally get away with-mii!

87
00:07:01,309 --> 00:07:05,899
But... we don't exactly have enough
room in the budget to hire any models.

88
00:07:06,078 --> 00:07:07,278
No problem!

89
00:07:07,819 --> 00:07:11,462
Lucky for you I've been building
my sexy secret stash for years!

90
00:07:11,844 --> 00:07:13,330
Secret stash?!

91
00:07:14,503 --> 00:07:18,544
Who needs to hire a model when there's
this many gorgeous babes on the payroll?

92
00:07:20,498 --> 00:07:22,273
It's about a terabyte's worth...

93
00:07:22,606 --> 00:07:25,587
Perfectly organized, tagged, and thumbnailed of course!

94
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:29,018
I'll just go ahead and give you complete access to
the server so you can do whatever you want with 'em...

95
00:07:29,066 --> 00:07:31,234
and I do mean whatever-mii.

96
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:32,568
This is wonderful!

97
00:07:32,593 --> 00:07:36,023
The Goddess Libra will surely
bless your generosity, my friend!

98
00:07:37,776 --> 00:07:39,552
Ooh, right there...!

99
00:07:39,577 --> 00:07:41,051
Ahhh that's good...

100
00:07:41,076 --> 00:07:42,699
Ahh hah hah hah...

101
00:07:42,724 --> 00:07:44,447
Yeeeees! Ohhhh!

102
00:08:00,248 --> 00:08:03,500
How do you like that?! I'd say it's a masterpiece!

103
00:08:03,556 --> 00:08:06,029
Since I'm clearly not the target audience...

104
00:08:06,054 --> 00:08:09,278
I shouldn't complain... It's not my place to argue.

105
00:08:09,579 --> 00:08:12,765
Personally... I think it's extremely revolting but...

106
00:08:12,836 --> 00:08:15,662
Oh well... I guess that's just how the world works.

107
00:08:15,687 --> 00:08:18,391
I appreciate your understanding, Miss Isuzu.

108
00:08:18,445 --> 00:08:21,771
You know... a few of these
outfits look strangely familiar...

109
00:08:21,796 --> 00:08:24,175
I get the feeling I've seen them before...

110
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:26,800
But you hired models for this project right?

111
00:08:26,825 --> 00:08:28,584
Oh yes...! Of course I did!

112
00:08:28,724 --> 00:08:31,695
These thighs, for example. They're bothering me.

113
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:33,202
You and me both!

114
00:08:33,745 --> 00:08:36,379
Fair enough... We'll keep this part in.

115
00:08:36,404 --> 00:08:38,170
Thank you so much, Miss Isuzu!

116
00:08:38,242 --> 00:08:39,038
Look, I'm hunched...

117
00:08:39,067 --> 00:08:43,254
Anyway... It seems a little unfair to
cater exclusively to the male guests.

118
00:08:43,351 --> 00:08:45,164
What do you propose we do?

119
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,621
Let's get some advice from the girls next.

120
00:08:56,808 --> 00:08:58,584
This looks kinda familiar to me.

121
00:08:58,688 --> 00:08:59,670
No it doesn't.

122
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:03,296
It's just... explosions and sexy pictures of girls.

123
00:09:03,321 --> 00:09:05,244
Yeah, I'm kinda grossed out now.

124
00:09:05,514 --> 00:09:07,981
Let's see what the internet thinks about this.

125
00:09:08,224 --> 00:09:10,819
Ok... how can I make it better?

126
00:09:11,746 --> 00:09:13,083
Where do I start?

127
00:09:13,805 --> 00:09:18,199
Uh, listen... This is... just a... suggestion...

128
00:09:18,504 --> 00:09:23,110
but right now there's nothing at all in
this video that appeals to a female audience.

129
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:29,430
So um... We need male nudity as
many hot naked guys as possible!

130
00:09:29,563 --> 00:09:32,849
Girls want to see lots of
guy-on-guy action and tiny speedos...!

131
00:09:32,874 --> 00:09:35,876
Oh and plenty of close-up shots
of their bulging muscles too!

132
00:09:35,948 --> 00:09:38,190
I think that's just what YOU want to see.

133
00:09:38,489 --> 00:09:42,676
Oh no, any suggestions you girls
can give are more than welcome.

134
00:09:43,033 --> 00:09:44,784
After all, that's what I'm here for.

135
00:09:46,302 --> 00:09:49,966
Well, if you're asking what we like,
I wouldn't mind some shots of water.

136
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:52,572
You just mean normal water scenes, right?

137
00:09:52,628 --> 00:09:55,569
Yes! Looking at the water is so relaxing.

138
00:09:55,686 --> 00:09:59,169
I have lots of footage of rivers and
oceans if you want me to send them to you.

139
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:04,515
If that's the case, I think I
might have a contribution to make too!

140
00:10:05,195 --> 00:10:06,073
Oh?

141
00:10:07,596 --> 00:10:09,366
I'm pretty sure you'll like it.

142
00:10:14,501 --> 00:10:16,498
Why do you have that? Delete it right now...

143
00:10:16,707 --> 00:10:19,257
They're from that sleepover at your place.

144
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,051
I just sent them to you, Triken.

145
00:10:22,076 --> 00:10:24,264
Hopefully you'll be able to use them for something good.

146
00:10:24,289 --> 00:10:27,191
Yes ma'am...! I assure you they'll be VERY beneficial.

147
00:10:27,359 --> 00:10:29,091
No way! I won't let you have them!

148
00:11:02,112 --> 00:11:03,718
So what do you think of it?

149
00:11:03,798 --> 00:11:06,526
I'm not... sure WHAT to think.

150
00:11:07,077 --> 00:11:09,554
I can't believe these are the models you selected.

151
00:11:09,701 --> 00:11:14,871
Well... actually we were low on funding after
I DEFINITELY hired models for the first one,

152
00:11:14,896 --> 00:11:16,997
so I asked the gentlemen from security to help us out.

153
00:11:17,045 --> 00:11:18,954
You mean Okuro and the others?

154
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:23,130
Yes, luckily some of the new
part-timers were willing to play along too.

155
00:11:24,072 --> 00:11:26,219
Couldn't you have enlisted someone else?

156
00:11:26,451 --> 00:11:30,000
Surely they're not the most
attractive men you could've asked.

157
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:32,640
Oh? Is there anyone in particular?

158
00:11:33,062 --> 00:11:33,673
Well...

159
00:11:36,428 --> 00:11:37,266
Nevermind.

160
00:11:37,431 --> 00:11:39,820
You were talking about Mr. Kanie, weren't you?

161
00:11:39,845 --> 00:11:40,505
Shut your mouth.

162
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:42,018
I nailed it, didn't I?!

163
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:44,011
Nothing gets past old Triken!

164
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:44,976
Don't even bother trying...

165
00:11:45,001 --> 00:11:46,223
I said shut it.

166
00:11:46,262 --> 00:11:47,524
Consider it shut then.

167
00:11:47,997 --> 00:11:52,423
Anyway... do we really need footage
of a river flowing or Muse taking a nap?

168
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:56,531
Surprisingly, Sylphy's contribution is the most relevant.

169
00:11:56,561 --> 00:11:59,504
Oh, you're right, that's kind
of an unexpected twist, isn't it?

170
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:02,523
I think we need to ask for other people's opinions now.

171
00:12:03,201 --> 00:12:04,879
What about the most important person?

172
00:12:05,229 --> 00:12:06,463
Talk to her next.

173
00:12:06,638 --> 00:12:08,929
The most important person, you say?

174
00:12:11,726 --> 00:12:14,194
Yes...? You really need my help?

175
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:23,422
Some kind of promotional video? I'm sorry...

176
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:26,155
but I wouldn't know how to help with something like that.

177
00:12:26,187 --> 00:12:27,706
Anything will be helpful...

178
00:12:27,808 --> 00:12:31,655
Perhaps you could tell me what sort of
things you'd like the video to be about.

179
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:32,614
Hmm...

180
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:34,379
Oh I know...!

181
00:12:34,489 --> 00:12:36,250
This is the perfect opportunity...!

182
00:12:36,614 --> 00:12:39,328
Why don't you feature the park
employees who work behind the scenes,

183
00:12:39,353 --> 00:12:41,803
so they can have a chance to shine for a change?

184
00:12:46,698 --> 00:12:48,802
A promo? Well I'll be!

185
00:12:49,586 --> 00:12:51,498
Maybe this is what you're looking for.

186
00:12:51,689 --> 00:12:52,667
I see...

187
00:12:54,245 --> 00:12:55,640
You're making a video?

188
00:12:56,186 --> 00:12:58,989
That's right...! Do you think I
could get a shot of you cooking?

189
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:01,127
No thanks... too much effort.

190
00:13:02,245 --> 00:13:04,182
Excuse me, Mr. Wrench.

191
00:13:04,212 --> 00:13:06,527
Dammit all, can'tcha see I'm busy?!

192
00:13:06,712 --> 00:13:08,713
Huh? You're filming again?

193
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:13,215
Yes. But this time I want to focus
on the security force as a whole.

194
00:13:13,621 --> 00:13:18,842
Perhaps I'll get some footage of you working the
gate or training other employees, things of that nature.

195
00:13:19,318 --> 00:13:21,516
Oh really? That sounds good.

196
00:13:21,596 --> 00:13:26,116
I'm sorry, I'm not sure how to make accounting
look interesting on video... So what should I do?

197
00:13:27,151 --> 00:13:30,119
That's alright, Miss Ashe, it doesn't have to be your job;

198
00:13:30,151 --> 00:13:31,965
It could be something you do on your days off.

199
00:13:32,013 --> 00:13:32,275
Yes!

200
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,787
It just needs to represent who you are as a person.

201
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:35,986
Who I am?

202
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:37,762
Well then...

203
00:13:39,891 --> 00:13:41,927
I might have something interesting...

204
00:13:42,044 --> 00:13:43,845
from back in my school days.

205
00:13:43,972 --> 00:13:46,171
Ah... and what is that?

206
00:13:46,565 --> 00:13:48,711
Footage of my club activities.

207
00:13:50,516 --> 00:13:52,143
You need help with a promo?

208
00:13:52,723 --> 00:13:56,751
Right, I'm looking for suggestions
from as many park employees as possible.

209
00:13:56,945 --> 00:14:00,489
I'd love to come up with something
unique that makes a big impact.

210
00:14:00,787 --> 00:14:03,048
Wouldn't you know it I have just the thing.

211
00:14:03,197 --> 00:14:06,650
It's something I made with a
group of like-minded individuals.

212
00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:12,791
If you gimme some time... I'll go on a
wild west adventure and film it for ya.

213
00:14:14,022 --> 00:14:18,083
I think this noble endeavor could greatly
benefit from the spirit of the samurai!

214
00:14:18,155 --> 00:14:22,655
Aye lads, an' I'd wager a fine pirate
like meself'd be a perfect addition.

215
00:14:22,918 --> 00:14:26,062
What about a hard-hitting drama about saving the earth?

216
00:14:27,488 --> 00:14:31,200
Hello... Mr. Codain? What do you think?

217
00:14:31,699 --> 00:14:36,057
Do you ever talk at all? Ah! What's that?

218
00:14:48,622 --> 00:14:52,374
Okay, today I'm gonna demonstrate
the proper method for slicing meat...

219
00:14:52,443 --> 00:14:55,523
First you hold the knife just like this and then...

220
00:14:55,548 --> 00:14:57,259
I SAID BEAT IT!

221
00:15:11,431 --> 00:15:12,775
That's awesome!

222
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,216
I feel so inspired now!

223
00:15:15,241 --> 00:15:16,702
Totally worth the trip!

224
00:15:16,727 --> 00:15:19,457
Look this way, guys, you're on video!

225
00:15:36,922 --> 00:15:37,535
Hyahhhh!

226
00:15:45,773 --> 00:15:50,440
In my final hour... my humble
heart is cleansed of all regret.

227
00:15:50,965 --> 00:15:55,354
For I know I sacrifice my life
for the sake of countless others.

228
00:16:20,695 --> 00:16:24,157
I didn't understand that... but I think it works.

229
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,624
What?! THIS is what we want?

230
00:16:26,664 --> 00:16:28,601
I'm curious about Ashe's part...

231
00:16:28,682 --> 00:16:30,201
What on earth was she doing?

232
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:33,124
It's a competitive sport known as extreme ironing...

233
00:16:33,282 --> 00:16:36,295
Apparently you're supposed to
iron clothes in bizarre places.

234
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,904
Well, I suppose we all have our hobbies, don't we?

235
00:16:38,929 --> 00:16:42,391
I didn't really understand the part
with Dornell visiting the dam either.

236
00:16:42,481 --> 00:16:47,079
I wasn't aware of it before, but it
turns out there's quite a fan base for dams.

237
00:16:48,788 --> 00:16:52,188
Well alright then... Each part of the
video does seem special in its own way,

238
00:16:52,213 --> 00:16:54,331
so it covers a wide range of interests.

239
00:16:54,802 --> 00:16:59,421
Indeed... and I believe we have enough footage
to work with at this point, wouldn't you agree?

240
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,417
Oh I don't think I'd say that yet...

241
00:17:01,489 --> 00:17:05,594
The next step is to hear the opinion of
someone who's closer to a visitor's viewpoint.

242
00:17:05,633 --> 00:17:07,488
And where are we going to get that?

243
00:17:07,513 --> 00:17:09,804
Talk to those three girls we hired recently.

244
00:17:11,129 --> 00:17:13,356
I'd say it needs more blood and guts!

245
00:17:13,381 --> 00:17:14,802
Why blood and guts?!

246
00:17:14,891 --> 00:17:18,396
You know...! Everybody likes to watch
things that creep them out, don't they?

247
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:21,870
So just throw in a bit of
violence and it'll be a masterpiece.

248
00:17:21,989 --> 00:17:25,781
Trust me on this one... It's
gonna be a big hit with the visitors.

249
00:17:25,806 --> 00:17:28,860
Well... i-if you're sure about it...

250
00:17:31,191 --> 00:17:33,835
I... I think the video looks fonderwul!

251
00:17:34,259 --> 00:17:35,997
N-no wait I mean... W-wonderful!

252
00:17:36,077 --> 00:17:37,615
Is that how you honestly feel?

253
00:17:38,864 --> 00:17:41,870
W-well... maybe... you uh...

254
00:17:42,634 --> 00:17:43,926
Actually nevermind, don't worry about it!

255
00:17:45,788 --> 00:17:49,069
Wow Triken... I think you've
done a beautiful job with this.

256
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,427
You think it's beautiful?

257
00:17:50,632 --> 00:17:52,522
Of course...! Although...

258
00:17:52,808 --> 00:17:55,697
if you wouldn't mind me stating my own personal opinion...

259
00:17:55,792 --> 00:18:00,281
I just can't help but feel that it's lacking a
certain emotional quality in its current state.

260
00:18:00,588 --> 00:18:02,969
Emotional? Do you have an example?

261
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:06,476
You see... I happen to be quite interested in horses.

262
00:18:06,639 --> 00:18:09,829
They've been a hobby of mine since I was a girl, actually.

263
00:18:09,854 --> 00:18:10,360
Huh.

264
00:18:10,594 --> 00:18:15,227
And not too long ago, I was lucky enough to have
a chance to witness a mother horse giving birth.

265
00:18:15,643 --> 00:18:18,840
It was a horse that's been very special
to me since I was in high school...

266
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:21,157
Her name's Kikuno Scepter, isn't that sweet?

267
00:18:21,182 --> 00:18:22,588
That's an interesting name...

268
00:18:22,651 --> 00:18:26,930
The delivery was extremely
difficult... but now she's a proud mother!

269
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:31,206
In all my life... I've never been so moved!

270
00:18:37,592 --> 00:18:38,678
Finished!

271
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:40,672
It's amazing!

272
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:23,793
Moff.

273
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:26,410
Ron!

274
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:30,579
Heheh...

275
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:34,369
That's awesome!

276
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:37,194
I feel so inspired now!

277
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:38,585
Totally worth the trip!

278
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:39,910
Look this way guys.

279
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:42,744
Hyahhh!

280
00:19:59,133 --> 00:20:01,755
First you hold the knife just like this and then...

281
00:20:01,983 --> 00:20:03,982
I SAID BEAT IT!

282
00:20:34,082 --> 00:20:35,491
It's taking too long!

283
00:20:35,828 --> 00:20:37,869
If this keeps up, Kikuno won't make it!

284
00:20:37,894 --> 00:20:38,985
Let's pull it out!

285
00:20:39,442 --> 00:20:41,370
It's a tough angle, but I think we're gonna have to...

286
00:20:41,654 --> 00:20:42,393
Get ready!

287
00:20:42,418 --> 00:20:42,988
Right!

288
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:44,586
Hang in there, Kikuno!

289
00:20:44,616 --> 00:20:45,687
Kikuno, push!

290
00:20:46,533 --> 00:20:47,847
Come on out, we're almost there!

291
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:48,953
She's standing up!

292
00:21:06,656 --> 00:21:08,347
What the hell did you do?!

293
00:21:08,502 --> 00:21:11,572
Ah yes, I knew I'd get a big reaction from you, Mr. Kanie.

294
00:21:11,597 --> 00:21:14,685
Sento...! You were supposed
to be supervising this project!

295
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:15,776
What were you doing?!

296
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:17,899
I'm so moved!

297
00:21:17,988 --> 00:21:18,643
What?!

298
00:21:18,668 --> 00:21:20,141
It's a touching story...

299
00:21:20,718 --> 00:21:22,220
of dreams coming true...

300
00:21:23,393 --> 00:21:24,898
What's not to like about it?

301
00:21:27,644 --> 00:21:28,790
Everything!

302
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,680
Moff, not enough action.

303
00:21:39,801 --> 00:21:41,765
Yeah and what happened to the dam, man?

304
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:44,532
Nah, the real problem is the music selection-ron.

305
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,163
I thought you were gonna use our footage.

306
00:21:47,301 --> 00:21:50,086
Where's my collection of sexy pictures-mii?

307
00:21:50,111 --> 00:21:53,717
I don't understand why nobody
bothered asking ME for an idea.

308
00:21:53,742 --> 00:21:54,886
Quit complaining...!

309
00:21:54,926 --> 00:21:56,230
We can't use that one.

310
00:21:57,723 --> 00:22:02,534
Actually Mr. Kanie, I took it upon myself to
upload the other video to the internet as well.

311
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:03,343
You what?!

312
00:22:03,477 --> 00:22:05,015
And it's going viral.

313
00:22:08,477 --> 00:22:09,625
No way!

314
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,531
Time for the attractions spotlight.

315
00:23:44,126 --> 00:23:45,965
Today's feature is Whip Antique.

316
00:23:46,628 --> 00:23:49,969
Wait, this was the last episode.
And why does it say "no image"?

317
00:23:50,168 --> 00:23:51,405
Don't worry about it.

318
00:23:51,604 --> 00:23:54,475
Whip Antique. Where fantasies come true.

319
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,216
Everybody loves Whip Antique.

320
00:23:56,241 --> 00:23:57,511
Did you need to repeat that?

321
00:23:57,536 --> 00:23:59,520
Come on down to Whip Antique.

322
00:23:59,545 --> 00:24:02,210
Oh I get it. This is some kind of advertisement.

323
00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:04,739
Remember, it's Whip Antique.

324
00:24:04,824 --> 00:24:07,854
I'm not sure what kind of shop
it is, or what they sell though.

325
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:09,387
Don't you think that's important?!
