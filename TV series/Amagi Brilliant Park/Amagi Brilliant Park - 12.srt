1
00:00:13,508 --> 00:00:15,685
What? But we made sure...

2
00:00:15,801 --> 00:00:17,688
It's the ticket utilization rate.

3
00:00:18,305 --> 00:00:19,526
Utilization?

4
00:00:19,708 --> 00:00:23,313
I was expecting a couple of the tickets
they sold to end up being no‐shows...

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,208
but I didn't think the number would be so high!

6
00:00:26,918 --> 00:00:29,206
I miscalculated! Damn it!

7
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:34,692
We'll never get 252 people by 9 o'clock!

8
00:00:34,756 --> 00:00:38,042
Princess... I think this may be the end!

9
00:02:13,499 --> 00:02:14,745
Please help!

10
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,538
C'mon... we're not asking for much here!

11
00:02:18,576 --> 00:02:20,284
It'll only take a second!

12
00:02:20,309 --> 00:02:21,564
Just come in for a minuet.

13
00:02:21,589 --> 00:02:22,907
We beseech you, sir!

14
00:02:22,932 --> 00:02:25,459
You'll be doing our world a service!

15
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:26,908
How about you ladies?

16
00:02:26,943 --> 00:02:30,228
Would you and your little ones please
come visit AmaBri for just a quick second?

17
00:02:30,487 --> 00:02:32,686
Sorry... we're about to be late for dinner!

18
00:02:32,711 --> 00:02:33,572
It won't take long!

19
00:02:33,597 --> 00:02:34,807
We're desperate!

20
00:02:34,832 --> 00:02:35,825
Sorry!

21
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,915
Yes, immediately.

22
00:02:39,121 --> 00:02:41,021
We're inviting you to Amagi Brilliant Park.

23
00:02:41,046 --> 00:02:42,142
Absolutely free!

24
00:02:42,449 --> 00:02:43,069
Yes... yes...

25
00:02:43,393 --> 00:02:44,326
That's right sir...

26
00:02:44,351 --> 00:02:45,832
it won't cost you anything.

27
00:02:45,857 --> 00:02:47,979
Of course not... That's not my intention.

28
00:02:48,772 --> 00:02:49,735
Sorry to bother you.

29
00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:51,779
No good.

30
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:53,061
I got turned down again.

31
00:02:53,293 --> 00:02:54,742
No luck here either.

32
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,200
Wanipee and the girls are advertising at
the station right now, but... we'll see.

33
00:03:02,005 --> 00:03:03,820
There's gotta be something we can do!

34
00:03:08,382 --> 00:03:11,989
Come on now! Don't you kids think it's
about time for you to throw in the towel?

35
00:03:15,632 --> 00:03:17,109
It's not over yet!

36
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:19,745
We've still got a moffin' chance at this!

37
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:21,683
Let's fight 'til the end!

38
00:03:22,941 --> 00:03:23,407
But...

39
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,650
Hey Takami, sorry to call you at work.

40
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,751
Yeah it's me. Listen.

41
00:03:29,836 --> 00:03:33,457
Could you bring every single customer
you have over to AmaBri right now?

42
00:03:33,563 --> 00:03:35,052
It's really important.

43
00:03:35,373 --> 00:03:36,347
Huh? Hey!

44
00:03:36,377 --> 00:03:38,314
Tell 'em I'll pay their tabs if they come.

45
00:03:38,612 --> 00:03:40,430
We came up short on visitors.

46
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,901
I'll never ask you for moffin' else!

47
00:03:43,668 --> 00:03:46,735
Uh‐huh... Thanks a lot... See ya.

48
00:03:47,948 --> 00:03:49,384
Don't just stand there!

49
00:03:49,511 --> 00:03:50,904
Start calling!

50
00:03:51,021 --> 00:03:53,200
Everyone you know!

51
00:03:54,185 --> 00:03:56,254
You're serious? Cold‐calling?

52
00:03:56,318 --> 00:03:57,914
Hey... Pachinko Parlor?

53
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:59,834
Shizue? Is that you‐mii?

54
00:03:59,881 --> 00:04:01,705
Hello Grandma‐this is Muse.

55
00:04:01,797 --> 00:04:04,137
Sorry to bother you. Is the con over yet?

56
00:04:04,243 --> 00:04:07,875
Most people scroll right past stuff like this, but... eh.

57
00:04:09,732 --> 00:04:11,025
Tally ho!

58
00:04:14,303 --> 00:04:15,129
Hello there.

59
00:04:15,162 --> 00:04:16,365
I know it's been a while,

60
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,501
but I actually have a bit of a favor to ask of you.

61
00:04:18,526 --> 00:04:20,442
It's 252 people...

62
00:04:20,474 --> 00:04:23,184
I highly doubt this'll make enough difference.

63
00:04:23,499 --> 00:04:25,379
Sento, you're in on this too?

64
00:04:25,527 --> 00:04:27,601
I'm telling the cast to help out.

65
00:04:29,031 --> 00:04:31,440
Hey buddy, long time no see.

66
00:04:31,684 --> 00:04:33,989
There's a little somethin' I need from ya...

67
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:34,962
Good evening!

68
00:04:35,321 --> 00:04:37,675
No, I don't need to order supplies today.

69
00:04:37,897 --> 00:04:39,101
Thank you very much!

70
00:04:39,126 --> 00:04:41,276
I do appreciate your support.

71
00:04:41,301 --> 00:04:44,381
Arr, if ye refuse it's the gallows fer ya!

72
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:47,307
Come on, pops! I'm only askin' for two or three head!

73
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:49,871
Yeah, I'll take a medium Margherita pizza.

74
00:04:49,926 --> 00:04:52,583
Oh and make sure you bring it
through the main gate please.

75
00:04:52,687 --> 00:04:55,391
Ecological emergency... mhm.

76
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:00,424
Hello? Hellooo?

77
00:05:16,018 --> 00:05:17,182
Fine, I'll do it!

78
00:05:18,721 --> 00:05:21,731
Uh... hey... is this Terano? It's Kanie.

79
00:05:21,776 --> 00:05:24,917
I was wondering if... What? No, it's not that.

80
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:29,599
Listen. I still don't really understand
what happened but... I'm so sorry.

81
00:05:30,014 --> 00:05:34,337
A‐anyway, I need to ask a favor of
you and it has to be done right NOW, okay?

82
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,231
Moff!

83
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,304
Takami!

84
00:05:57,489 --> 00:05:59,357
Hey. sorry it took us so long!

85
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,585
Sorry to put you out.

86
00:06:04,622 --> 00:06:05,565
Don't mention it.

87
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:07,674
I could never say no to a regular in trouble!

88
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:09,267
Look! It's them‐ron!

89
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,265
What's up?

90
00:06:10,531 --> 00:06:11,727
Who are they‐mii?

91
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:13,923
They work at my favorite pachinko place!

92
00:06:15,852 --> 00:06:17,500
What the moff is this?

93
00:06:17,564 --> 00:06:20,320
Heh. I told all their husbands they were cheating on 'em.

94
00:06:23,809 --> 00:06:25,341
You really went all out...

95
00:06:25,366 --> 00:06:27,884
Oh no. This isn't the half of it‐mii!

96
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:29,585
That bastard messed with my wife!

97
00:06:29,827 --> 00:06:32,649
See? Double the numbers‐mii!

98
00:06:33,343 --> 00:06:35,826
Look mommy. They're having a grownup discussion!

99
00:06:35,851 --> 00:06:38,441
Shush. Just pretend you don't see anything.

100
00:06:43,155 --> 00:06:44,559
That's my grandma!

101
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:48,159
Sorry dear... none of my friends could make it.

102
00:06:48,184 --> 00:06:51,024
Mm‐mm... I'm just glad you're here, Grandma!

103
00:06:51,198 --> 00:06:52,583
Gang's all here, Salama!

104
00:06:52,608 --> 00:06:54,222
Oh wow! my followers!

105
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,073
Sorry we're late, Kobory.

106
00:06:56,098 --> 00:06:57,658
You brought the whole club!

107
00:06:57,923 --> 00:06:59,403
Shirukooooo!

108
00:06:59,428 --> 00:07:00,207
Huh?!

109
00:07:02,274 --> 00:07:04,265
Shiruko is taking the stage!

110
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,122
Do I wanna know?

111
00:07:06,302 --> 00:07:08,612
Apparently she's an internet celebrity‐ron.

112
00:07:08,713 --> 00:07:10,247
A million hits?!

113
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,979
We just need 8 more people.

114
00:07:41,004 --> 00:07:42,366
We might make it!

115
00:07:42,391 --> 00:07:43,956
Kanie!

116
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:45,953
Okay we're here, now what?

117
00:07:46,297 --> 00:07:47,174
Terano!

118
00:07:47,576 --> 00:07:50,057
I‐I'm sorry. I could only get so many people to come.

119
00:07:50,194 --> 00:07:51,594
No... this is great!

120
00:07:51,827 --> 00:07:54,204
What the heck kinda goofy outfits are those?

121
00:07:55,072 --> 00:07:56,860
Don't worry about that.

122
00:07:57,162 --> 00:07:59,188
Moff! Only three more!

123
00:08:01,491 --> 00:08:02,264
What is it?

124
00:08:02,904 --> 00:08:04,476
They were the last people...

125
00:08:05,427 --> 00:08:07,458
That's everyone we contacted.

126
00:08:13,203 --> 00:08:15,537
But I don't have anyone else to call!

127
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:16,589
Neither do I-ron!

128
00:08:16,614 --> 00:08:18,352
I'll try posting again!

129
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:20,009
But we can't lose now!

130
00:08:20,034 --> 00:08:21,264
Somebody please!

131
00:08:22,195 --> 00:08:23,847
No, it's all over...!

132
00:08:23,872 --> 00:08:26,493
I'm gonna disappear forever!

133
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:28,065
Moff!

134
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,415
Just three more!

135
00:08:29,993 --> 00:08:32,263
Someone! Anyone!

136
00:08:33,276 --> 00:08:35,797
Again... I failed her again!

137
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,475
Mommy, I'm tired...

138
00:08:41,965 --> 00:08:44,093
We'll be home soon, okay?

139
00:08:44,209 --> 00:08:44,994
Huh?

140
00:08:47,112 --> 00:08:49,473
IT'S A GIRLLLL!

141
00:08:50,018 --> 00:08:51,716
Wahoo!

142
00:08:53,427 --> 00:08:54,612
Don't you move.

143
00:08:58,272 --> 00:08:59,005
Hah!

144
00:08:59,441 --> 00:09:00,665
Yahoo!

145
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:01,653
Yeahhh!

146
00:09:07,504 --> 00:09:09,136
We... we won...

147
00:09:09,474 --> 00:09:11,231
Moffin' barely...

148
00:09:13,077 --> 00:09:16,188
500,000! The park is saved!

149
00:09:18,634 --> 00:09:20,597
That was awesome‐mii!

150
00:09:40,344 --> 00:09:40,987
Hmph...

151
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:50,399
All tuckered out?

152
00:09:51,325 --> 00:09:52,278
No I'm not...

153
00:09:52,357 --> 00:09:53,018
Seiya.

154
00:09:53,909 --> 00:09:55,123
I gotta admit...

155
00:09:55,186 --> 00:09:57,686
We have you to thank for saving us.

156
00:10:03,318 --> 00:10:04,578
Mr. Kanie!

157
00:10:04,603 --> 00:10:06,291
Thank-you-thank-you-thank-you!

158
00:10:07,846 --> 00:10:09,305
It's... it's a miracle!

159
00:10:09,336 --> 00:10:12,314
I'm practically hunched over in tears...

160
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:16,269
Hey! get off of me ya bunch of goofballs!

161
00:10:16,294 --> 00:10:19,973
Sir Kanie... Thank you...

162
00:10:20,396 --> 00:10:22,309
Thank you so much for all you've done!

163
00:10:30,267 --> 00:10:30,907
Alright!

164
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:35,485
Here's to pulling together to save
the earth from total destruction! Cheers!

165
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,906
Cheers!

166
00:10:39,019 --> 00:10:40,003
Everything's settled.

167
00:10:40,038 --> 00:10:42,867
Yes, sir! the park will be open tomorrow as normal.

168
00:10:43,507 --> 00:10:44,858
Now, about selling the land...

169
00:10:46,118 --> 00:10:48,202
Oh that's excellent, thank you so much!

170
00:10:48,687 --> 00:10:50,403
We'll send someone over in a few days.

171
00:10:51,098 --> 00:10:52,368
Okay, say moff!

172
00:10:52,393 --> 00:10:53,561
Moff!

173
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:56,478
Thank you so much, Princess Latifah!

174
00:10:56,672 --> 00:10:57,405
It's my pleasure.

175
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,981
Th‐thank you for t‐taking it, M‐Mr. Moffle!

176
00:11:00,306 --> 00:11:02,057
Moff, no trouble at all.

177
00:11:02,137 --> 00:11:03,456
We'll see you later!

178
00:11:12,752 --> 00:11:14,245
Can I get everyone's attention?

179
00:11:15,276 --> 00:11:16,626
We have today's guest count.

180
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:21,522
Turns out we had 54976 people.

181
00:11:22,464 --> 00:11:24,571
As I told everybody when this whole thing started,

182
00:11:24,596 --> 00:11:27,129
I'll be stepping down as manager from this day forward.

183
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:28,180
Huh?

184
00:11:29,017 --> 00:11:32,491
I remember I was so shocked
when I saw how bad this place was.

185
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:34,854
Well it's still pretty bad!

186
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,086
Seriously, you losers had better be glad I'm a genius!

187
00:11:40,197 --> 00:11:41,881
What a stuck‐up jerk‐ron!

188
00:11:41,906 --> 00:11:43,792
Ehh, we'll let it slide today!

189
00:11:47,715 --> 00:11:48,265
But...

190
00:11:49,907 --> 00:11:51,155
But when the chips were down...

191
00:11:52,381 --> 00:11:55,187
I was totally powerless to carry you guys through it.

192
00:11:57,706 --> 00:12:01,649
But because of all of you...
we came out on the other side.

193
00:12:02,934 --> 00:12:05,906
So... I wanna thank you...

194
00:12:10,222 --> 00:12:11,212
Wha‐?!

195
00:12:11,889 --> 00:12:12,401
Huh?!

196
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,059
B‐be quiet!

197
00:12:15,084 --> 00:12:17,055
Anyway, I have another big announcement!

198
00:12:17,594 --> 00:12:22,206
Earlier this evening, we officially closed the
deal to sell off the secondary park to the south!

199
00:12:22,619 --> 00:12:24,633
The property was purchased by Moll Mart.

200
00:12:25,827 --> 00:12:30,318
Wait a minute, there's no way you're talking about
that supermarket chain that's famous around the world‐mii!

201
00:12:30,748 --> 00:12:31,244
Yep.

202
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:36,872
It won't be any time soon, but eventually they're
gonna build a giant shopping mall right next to AmaBri.

203
00:12:37,152 --> 00:12:40,213
That should lead to a nice
customer spillover on both sides.

204
00:12:40,792 --> 00:12:42,286
It'll be perfect synergy!

205
00:12:43,148 --> 00:12:46,847
So when that happens, you clowns are
gonna be so busy you won't have time to think!

206
00:12:54,593 --> 00:12:56,752
Oh boy, this is my chance to really be popular!

207
00:12:56,782 --> 00:12:57,857
Something wrong?

208
00:12:58,381 --> 00:12:59,085
It's nothing.

209
00:13:05,813 --> 00:13:06,829
What do you want?

210
00:13:08,197 --> 00:13:09,906
Very impressive.

211
00:13:10,868 --> 00:13:14,023
It looks like that prophecy was right about you after all.

212
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:16,195
So how do you know about that?

213
00:13:16,226 --> 00:13:17,751
You tell me, Champ.

214
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:22,492
Oops. I guess you can't read my mind anymore.

215
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:26,692
You may have gotten lucky this time, my
friend, but you can't rest on your laurels forever.

216
00:13:26,988 --> 00:13:31,628
No matter how many visitors the park may
get, the princess will still be losing Animus.

217
00:13:32,236 --> 00:13:35,022
In less than half an hour the date will change over.

218
00:13:35,078 --> 00:13:37,908
And a brand new year will start from page one.

219
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:42,133
Glimpsing an ember of hope only
to have it dashed before your eyes.

220
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:45,110
I can practically taste your despair.

221
00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:48,576
And I intend to savor every morsel!

222
00:13:52,201 --> 00:13:53,029
Kanie!

223
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,040
Moff!

224
00:13:58,533 --> 00:14:01,023
So all this time! It was him!

225
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:04,056
Moff my words, I'll crush that bastard!

226
00:14:04,081 --> 00:14:04,575
What the...?

227
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,494
He's the one who cast the curse...

228
00:14:06,566 --> 00:14:08,851
The sorcerer I told you about.

229
00:14:24,503 --> 00:14:25,573
It's almost time.

230
00:14:25,673 --> 00:14:26,250
Yeah.

231
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:27,640
I should say...

232
00:14:27,921 --> 00:14:28,655
Y‐yes?

233
00:14:29,311 --> 00:14:31,536
Thank you for everything, Lady Isuzu.

234
00:14:31,689 --> 00:14:35,789
I'm not certain who I'm going to be when
tomorrow comes but... I hope you'll support me.

235
00:14:36,636 --> 00:14:38,749
Yes... upon my life.

236
00:14:41,034 --> 00:14:41,867
And Uncle?

237
00:14:42,308 --> 00:14:43,122
Moff...

238
00:14:43,201 --> 00:14:44,854
Try not to drink so much.

239
00:14:46,282 --> 00:14:47,848
Okay, I'll try.

240
00:14:54,516 --> 00:14:56,177
Please take care, you three.

241
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,051
Lord Moffle...

242
00:15:15,309 --> 00:15:16,364
Sir Kanie.

243
00:15:17,763 --> 00:15:19,821
I don't think I can ever thank you enough.

244
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:20,742
Uh‐huh...

245
00:15:21,419 --> 00:15:23,122
You seem a little upset.

246
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:24,665
You think so?

247
00:15:24,935 --> 00:15:28,706
Yes! You haven't even boasted
about your "supreme intellect" yet.

248
00:15:41,146 --> 00:15:42,536
The truth is...

249
00:15:43,523 --> 00:15:45,696
This isn't what I want at all!

250
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:51,372
Not after I met you... not
after the happy days we all shared!

251
00:15:51,748 --> 00:15:54,961
And not after the wonderful miracle I witnessed tonight!

252
00:15:56,252 --> 00:15:59,894
I just can't bear the fact
that I'm about to forget it all!

253
00:16:14,592 --> 00:16:18,391
It's not much... but this is all I can do.

254
00:16:23,954 --> 00:16:25,083
It helps.

255
00:17:08,771 --> 00:17:09,685
That tree...

256
00:17:11,595 --> 00:17:13,935
I don't think it's ever bloomed that much.

257
00:17:22,532 --> 00:17:25,214
I failed her again... I couldn't...

258
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:37,632
Sir Kanie...?

259
00:17:37,663 --> 00:17:38,513
Moff?!

260
00:17:38,578 --> 00:17:39,713
You know who I am?!

261
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,277
Well of course I do...

262
00:17:49,456 --> 00:17:50,906
I DO remember!

263
00:17:55,448 --> 00:17:56,510
Latifah...

264
00:18:07,638 --> 00:18:12,053
That tree is called Elpis. It
thrives on Animus for energy.

265
00:18:12,548 --> 00:18:16,375
The amount it consumed in these three
months was enough to make it bloom.

266
00:18:16,853 --> 00:18:19,644
Animus also alleviates Her Majesty's curse...

267
00:18:19,776 --> 00:18:25,695
so I can only imagine the combined happy thoughts of
all the park visitors were what saved her in the end.

268
00:18:31,982 --> 00:18:32,712
Kanie!

269
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:34,978
Sento... What's up?

270
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:37,914
Are you... leaving now?

271
00:18:38,629 --> 00:18:40,398
Yep! Good riddance!

272
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,236
Look... Sento...

273
00:18:53,261 --> 00:18:54,304
Ah! Wh‐what?

274
00:18:54,329 --> 00:18:55,329
Here's the thing...

275
00:18:55,386 --> 00:18:56,019
Yes?

276
00:18:58,899 --> 00:19:00,586
It's nothing! Bye!

277
00:19:31,419 --> 00:19:32,752
Agh, dammit!

278
00:19:38,429 --> 00:19:40,096
Hey, sorry it's so late.

279
00:19:40,414 --> 00:19:41,905
How'd things go at work?

280
00:19:42,217 --> 00:19:44,053
Good, we delivered ahead of schedule.

281
00:19:44,757 --> 00:19:45,505
Ohh.

282
00:19:45,821 --> 00:19:47,319
Guess YOU had a rough day.

283
00:19:47,902 --> 00:19:48,702
I quit.

284
00:19:48,802 --> 00:19:50,526
You quit?! Already?!

285
00:19:50,598 --> 00:19:51,775
Well, that's a shame.

286
00:19:51,981 --> 00:19:52,786
Why's that?

287
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:54,866
You just looked like you were having fun.

288
00:19:54,906 --> 00:19:55,483
Huh?

289
00:19:56,139 --> 00:19:57,693
Yeah. you seemed excited!

290
00:19:57,773 --> 00:19:59,270
Ever since you first started.

291
00:19:59,903 --> 00:20:02,190
And you've never been excited about anything.

292
00:20:03,283 --> 00:20:04,532
Does that surprise you?

293
00:20:12,873 --> 00:20:14,631
I'm gonna puke‐mii...

294
00:20:14,656 --> 00:20:16,010
Oh good morning, you two!

295
00:20:16,344 --> 00:20:17,572
You don't look well...

296
00:20:17,597 --> 00:20:18,473
Are you hungover?

297
00:20:18,498 --> 00:20:21,142
Here comes the miracle dribble past 11 opponents!

298
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:23,001
Ah, youth‐ron...

299
00:20:23,026 --> 00:20:25,849
I'm not doin' squat today...

300
00:20:25,874 --> 00:20:27,831
Hey, no lying down on the job!

301
00:20:27,947 --> 00:20:28,889
Kanie!

302
00:20:29,838 --> 00:20:31,267
I thought you quit yesterday!

303
00:20:31,292 --> 00:20:32,383
I changed my mind.

304
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:36,388
Without me, you'll go back to slacking off all the time...

305
00:20:36,476 --> 00:20:38,841
I'll be keeping an eye on you from now on.

306
00:20:39,143 --> 00:20:40,085
Seriously?

307
00:20:40,157 --> 00:20:42,027
He's gone full Big Brother!

308
00:20:42,176 --> 00:20:44,322
Quiet! It's almost time to open.

309
00:20:44,347 --> 00:20:45,040
Moff?

310
00:20:45,301 --> 00:20:47,350
We've got work to do, you lousy rat.

311
00:20:47,781 --> 00:20:48,627
Get busy.

312
00:20:50,174 --> 00:20:51,899
Well, I'll be moffed.

313
00:20:55,628 --> 00:20:57,663
Perfect... Not that I'm surprised.

314
00:20:58,525 --> 00:20:59,579
You came back...

315
00:20:59,986 --> 00:21:01,739
Sento... Late, I see.

316
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:03,294
Did I miss something?

317
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:05,608
Yeah, this place is a disaster.

318
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:09,769
If we let our guard down just because we
reached the goal, it'll ruin everything.

319
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:11,747
You mean... you're...?

320
00:21:11,778 --> 00:21:15,528
Yeah yeah... Enough chit‐chat! How's the schedule today?

321
00:21:15,623 --> 00:21:19,106
Ah... first we have a pre‐shift
meeting with all the cast members.

322
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,138
Then let's go.

323
00:21:27,943 --> 00:21:29,086
Sir Kanie!

324
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,643
I'm here to stay.

325
00:21:31,199 --> 00:21:34,224
Well, at least until everyone finally
gets their sorry selves together.

326
00:21:35,515 --> 00:21:36,275
Great!

327
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,649
I hope you're grateful!

328
00:21:37,895 --> 00:21:40,536
I'm going out of my way to bless you with my skills!

329
00:21:44,422 --> 00:21:45,821
Is everything ready to go?!

330
00:21:45,974 --> 00:21:47,488
Yeah!

331
00:21:47,513 --> 00:21:49,207
I want you to give it all you've got!

332
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,168
Open the gates!

333
00:21:53,033 --> 00:21:54,210
Come on in!

334
00:21:54,524 --> 00:21:57,322
Enjoy your day at Amagi Brilliant Park!

335
00:23:43,334 --> 00:23:45,134
Attractions Spotlight!

336
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:48,864
The park is still open! You wanna do the honors, Sento?

337
00:23:49,028 --> 00:23:54,651
Of course. Today's feature is Space Captain
a thrilling retro sci‐fi adventure ride.

338
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:58,778
The hero embarks on an epic
quest to the far ends of the galaxy.

339
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:02,223
Let me guess, you're about to tell me
something lame that ruins the whole thing.

340
00:24:02,481 --> 00:24:03,403
How did you know?

341
00:24:03,629 --> 00:24:07,787
The ride is currently shut down because
the Captain is suffering from lower back pain.

342
00:24:07,896 --> 00:24:08,980
I knew it.
