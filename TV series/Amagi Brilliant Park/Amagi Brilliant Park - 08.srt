1
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:07,589
Amagi Transport says they can add more buses.

2
00:00:08,028 --> 00:00:09,800
And as for the sports stadium...

3
00:00:09,825 --> 00:00:12,114
I haven't gotten a definite response yet.

4
00:00:12,426 --> 00:00:14,144
Sounds good... Keep it up.

5
00:00:14,663 --> 00:00:18,738
I did get an answer from Moll
Mart about the... other thing.

6
00:00:19,108 --> 00:00:19,887
Kanie?

7
00:00:20,221 --> 00:00:23,199
Sorry... I feel kinda dizzy...

8
00:00:26,356 --> 00:00:27,965
Kanie! What's wrong?!

9
00:01:59,612 --> 00:02:01,578
Mr. Kanie passed out?!

10
00:02:01,612 --> 00:02:03,060
What'd the doctor say?

11
00:02:03,085 --> 00:02:05,380
Probably just exhaustion mixed with a cold.

12
00:02:05,405 --> 00:02:07,317
Good, that's not too serious.

13
00:02:07,342 --> 00:02:09,474
We'd be in trouble if he had to go to the hospital.

14
00:02:10,525 --> 00:02:12,090
I wonder if we can help him.

15
00:02:12,263 --> 00:02:15,293
I know! I could keep him hydrated with my water spells!

16
00:02:15,438 --> 00:02:17,258
And I'll keep him warm with my fire.

17
00:02:17,823 --> 00:02:19,866
And I'll bury him to leech out the poison.

18
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:22,432
I don't think that'll work for a cold...

19
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:25,041
I'm sorry, I won't let you.

20
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:28,703
But it's just a little cold. The paperwork's piling up...

21
00:02:28,728 --> 00:02:33,153
Absolutely not. I command you to remain at
home until you've made a complete recovery.

22
00:02:33,233 --> 00:02:35,868
Let me guess-you're not gonna let me go to school either.

23
00:02:36,218 --> 00:02:37,176
Sir Kanie.

24
00:02:38,128 --> 00:02:40,702
Do not underestimate the importance of your health.

25
00:02:45,644 --> 00:02:47,002
I hope you feel better soon...

26
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:48,776
Now get some rest.

27
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:56,979
Well that's great...

28
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,295
How are you feeling, Kanie?

29
00:03:04,098 --> 00:03:05,035
Hey Sento.

30
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,404
Look, could you please tell that
princess of yours not to worry so much?

31
00:03:11,236 --> 00:03:13,697
Hold on... What's that weird thing on your head?

32
00:03:14,754 --> 00:03:15,881
Just ignore it.

33
00:03:17,193 --> 00:03:19,113
I've missed a lot of school days already.

34
00:03:19,267 --> 00:03:21,040
I can't afford to take any more till...

35
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,365
S-Sento?!

36
00:03:23,565 --> 00:03:24,191
Hey!

37
00:03:25,816 --> 00:03:28,985
I want to be more than just your secretary-Kanie...

38
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,821
Whoa, I think this summer heat's getting to your head!

39
00:03:31,846 --> 00:03:32,905
Don't pull away.

40
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:35,833
I need to tell you... I... I want you...

41
00:03:37,904 --> 00:03:40,602
Just kidding... it was me all along mii!

42
00:03:40,627 --> 00:03:41,621
You sucker-ron!

43
00:03:41,646 --> 00:03:42,393
What the...?

44
00:03:43,859 --> 00:03:44,593
How did you...

45
00:03:46,995 --> 00:03:49,008
It's a magic Isuzu costume!

46
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:54,523
Yeah, we modified it from the ones
they use in the Diggery Clan-ron!

47
00:03:55,247 --> 00:03:56,117
That's messed up.

48
00:03:56,197 --> 00:03:59,321
Well at least now you don't have to
worry about missing your classes-mii!

49
00:03:59,915 --> 00:04:01,210
I can't believe what I'm hearing.

50
00:04:01,235 --> 00:04:02,719
You guys want to make a costume of me and go to my...

51
00:04:02,744 --> 00:04:05,686
Mhm! That's right-we wanna go to school in your place!

52
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,776
It's a pretty complete prototype.

53
00:04:07,801 --> 00:04:11,750
Unfortunately we weren't able to get an exact
reference for the parts underneath the clothes...

54
00:04:11,775 --> 00:04:13,712
so we used our imaginations-mii!

55
00:04:16,936 --> 00:04:19,574
Oh... when'd you get here Isuzu?

56
00:04:24,254 --> 00:04:26,555
Moff... I don't think it's a bad idea.

57
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,494
I mean-what else are you gonna do?

58
00:04:28,661 --> 00:04:30,909
It's not like you have any friends.

59
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:32,956
It'll be fine if they keep quiet.

60
00:04:33,054 --> 00:04:33,903
Ugh...

61
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,241
Then it's settled.

62
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:37,852
Oh, I know.

63
00:04:39,175 --> 00:04:40,536
What about spaghetti?

64
00:04:40,717 --> 00:04:42,141
What an amazing item...

65
00:04:42,772 --> 00:04:44,470
It's exactly like the original.

66
00:04:46,016 --> 00:04:49,351
Wahoo! Heh heh!

67
00:04:49,739 --> 00:04:50,590
Jackpot!

68
00:04:50,615 --> 00:04:52,129
I smell a girl!

69
00:04:55,517 --> 00:04:56,470
False alarm.

70
00:04:59,603 --> 00:05:01,050
K... Kanie?

71
00:05:01,817 --> 00:05:03,015
Good morning, sir!

72
00:05:03,063 --> 00:05:05,551
I heard you passed out from a cold recently and um...

73
00:05:05,765 --> 00:05:06,926
Wait. What's that?

74
00:05:06,951 --> 00:05:08,574
G-good morning, Miss Chujo...

75
00:05:08,635 --> 00:05:09,631
It's nothing.

76
00:05:09,736 --> 00:05:10,194
What?

77
00:05:10,219 --> 00:05:12,825
Ah, I mean, good morning, Chujo...

78
00:05:12,881 --> 00:05:14,613
And yeah, I'm not sick anymore.

79
00:05:14,783 --> 00:05:15,303
Oh...

80
00:05:15,328 --> 00:05:17,779
Anyway do I look nice and handsome today?

81
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:20,175
I'm not sure how to respond to that...

82
00:05:20,249 --> 00:05:22,414
Oh, but you seem like you're in a good mood!

83
00:05:22,448 --> 00:05:23,083
You think so?

84
00:05:23,108 --> 00:05:23,503
Yeah...

85
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:26,239
I mean, most of the time you just kind of ignore me.

86
00:05:26,264 --> 00:05:27,616
So I... I'm uh...

87
00:05:28,112 --> 00:05:29,552
I'm happy, I guess!

88
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:33,244
Goodness...

89
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,106
Kanie must really treat that girl poorly.

90
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:39,756
Hm?

91
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,895
"I've liked you ever since my first year."

92
00:05:50,252 --> 00:05:51,943
No matter what people say about you,

93
00:05:52,005 --> 00:05:53,843
I can tell you're a really nice person.

94
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:55,605
If it isn't too much trouble,

95
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:59,178
I'd like you to meet me behind the
gymnasium after school this afternoon.

96
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:01,765
Please give me the chance to tell you how I feel"?!

97
00:06:06,064 --> 00:06:07,184
What should I do?

98
00:06:07,758 --> 00:06:10,811
I thought of texting Kanie to see what he thinks about it,

99
00:06:10,836 --> 00:06:13,478
but he's still resting and I'd hate to bother him.

100
00:06:14,855 --> 00:06:17,293
This concept is sure to be on your test.

101
00:06:18,894 --> 00:06:19,811
It was a mistake?

102
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:24,761
Yeah, I could've sworn that shoebox
belonged to Kimura from class 2-5.

103
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:27,617
So I never meant for that love letter to go to you.

104
00:06:28,628 --> 00:06:30,785
Um... what's that on your head?

105
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:31,618
Just ignore it.

106
00:06:31,643 --> 00:06:34,394
Uh, so what you're saying is
you're not in love with Kanie...

107
00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:36,767
I mean, so I'm not the guy you're in love with huh?

108
00:06:36,838 --> 00:06:41,346
No... I guess you're upset...
I really am sorry about this!

109
00:06:41,465 --> 00:06:42,515
It's quite alright.

110
00:06:42,627 --> 00:06:43,296
Huh?

111
00:06:43,297 --> 00:06:44,909
Everyone makes mistakes sometimes.

112
00:06:44,934 --> 00:06:48,313
You didn't sign the letter, so you could've
just run away when you realized what happened,

113
00:06:48,338 --> 00:06:50,781
but you went out of your way to
apologize and set things right.

114
00:06:50,806 --> 00:06:52,055
That was very professional.

115
00:06:52,501 --> 00:06:54,118
Does that mean you forgive me?

116
00:06:54,154 --> 00:06:55,893
There's nothing to forgive you for...

117
00:06:55,941 --> 00:06:57,520
Thanks for being considerate.

118
00:06:57,545 --> 00:06:59,578
Wow, thank you so much, Kanie.

119
00:06:59,603 --> 00:07:00,979
When I realized what I had done,

120
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:03,579
I was so afraid you were going to yell at me or something.

121
00:07:03,808 --> 00:07:08,153
It's fine... In fact... I wish you the best
in all your endeavors, Miss Kanae Tsuchida.

122
00:07:08,383 --> 00:07:12,324
You know... I'm kind of happy I misplaced that letter.

123
00:07:12,436 --> 00:07:13,870
Well, goodbye for now!

124
00:07:16,252 --> 00:07:17,130
"For now"?

125
00:07:18,712 --> 00:07:20,952
So you didn't have any major issues?

126
00:07:20,977 --> 00:07:23,126
No, there was nothing worth reporting...

127
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,338
I hope you'll be as successful tomorrow.

128
00:07:25,434 --> 00:07:28,523
Ah high school... so many memories-ron!

129
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:32,019
I don't suppose you've ever heard of
Dokidoki Melody High School in Maple Land?

130
00:07:32,044 --> 00:07:34,669
It's super-famous for being full of troublemakers-ron.

131
00:07:34,694 --> 00:07:37,421
Yes, I'm always hearing about violent incidents.

132
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:41,496
I was top sheep back in the day.
Got expelled halfway through, though.

133
00:07:41,933 --> 00:07:44,871
We had a little scrap with some guys
from another school so they gave me the boot-

134
00:07:44,896 --> 00:07:45,925
I'm not interested.

135
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:46,742
Oh. Well.

136
00:07:46,782 --> 00:07:49,005
Just try not to cause any problems.

137
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,179
Don't worry about me.

138
00:07:50,204 --> 00:07:52,371
I can blend right in with those youngsters-ron.

139
00:07:56,608 --> 00:07:58,988
Ah... Listen, son...

140
00:07:59,368 --> 00:08:02,370
You can't do that in class...
and what's that on your head?

141
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:06,149
Just ignore it and focus on doing your job, old man.

142
00:08:06,174 --> 00:08:07,700
Wh... what did you say?!

143
00:08:07,725 --> 00:08:09,674
You're such a drag-ron!

144
00:08:10,304 --> 00:08:11,850
S-stay back!

145
00:08:12,427 --> 00:08:13,306
I don't want to fight...

146
00:08:13,331 --> 00:08:17,170
Hey teach... I'm not feelin' so
good, so I'm gonna go see the nurse now.

147
00:08:17,976 --> 00:08:18,660
See ya.

148
00:08:18,726 --> 00:08:19,333
Huh?

149
00:08:24,683 --> 00:08:27,480
Um, is that you, Mr. Kanie?

150
00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:30,365
Hm? Oh... it's you-ron.

151
00:08:30,394 --> 00:08:32,124
You-ron? I don't...

152
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:34,487
I forgot you were my classmate-ron.

153
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:35,447
What?

154
00:08:35,864 --> 00:08:37,105
Lunchtime already, huh?

155
00:08:37,545 --> 00:08:40,196
Man, this place is so boring
I can't even smoke a cigarette.

156
00:08:40,221 --> 00:08:42,270
I don't know how much I can take before I snap.

157
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:43,644
Did you say "snap"?

158
00:08:43,864 --> 00:08:45,360
Hey, wanna skip class with me?

159
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,433
I'm gonna go play some pachinko later.

160
00:08:48,511 --> 00:08:50,673
N-no thanks, I'm good, bye!

161
00:08:51,518 --> 00:08:53,526
Jeez, was it something I said?

162
00:08:54,332 --> 00:08:56,109
What do you mean, mistake?

163
00:08:56,448 --> 00:08:58,660
Terano told me you were planning to give me a letter...

164
00:08:58,751 --> 00:08:59,877
What happened to that?

165
00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:03,837
I was going to... but now I
can't figure out my true feelings.

166
00:09:03,862 --> 00:09:06,950
I'm having trouble deciding if
that's what I really want to do.

167
00:09:06,975 --> 00:09:08,344
But how can you say that?!

168
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:11,463
If you had asked me out, I
would've said yes in a heartbeat!

169
00:09:11,732 --> 00:09:13,836
I know, but things have changed...

170
00:09:14,464 --> 00:09:17,105
They could use some love advice from yours truly-ron.

171
00:09:17,466 --> 00:09:19,035
Take it easy there, son.

172
00:09:19,623 --> 00:09:20,436
Kanie?!

173
00:09:21,026 --> 00:09:22,574
Were you spying on us?!

174
00:09:22,807 --> 00:09:24,503
Oh, don't have a cow, ron.

175
00:09:24,745 --> 00:09:25,295
"Ron"?

176
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,491
I mean, uh...

177
00:09:27,223 --> 00:09:31,126
Take it from me kid, the harder you
chase after a lady the faster she runs away.

178
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,149
You just gotta be cool... Better to step aside
and let her collect her thoughts for a while...

179
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:37,286
than make an ass of yourself-ron... Understand?

180
00:09:37,311 --> 00:09:39,217
Who asked you?! And what's that?!

181
00:09:39,539 --> 00:09:40,615
Just ignore it.

182
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:44,293
I don't need advice from the guy who
got Tsuchida's love letter by mistake!

183
00:09:44,432 --> 00:09:45,084
Huh?!

184
00:09:45,397 --> 00:09:49,144
She had her eye on me in the first
place, and then THIS had to happen!

185
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,599
You're the last person I want to
talk to about this, you got that?!

186
00:09:52,718 --> 00:09:53,665
Wait a sec...

187
00:09:53,811 --> 00:09:55,789
Did you say she gave me a letter?

188
00:09:56,278 --> 00:09:56,875
Y-yes.

189
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:02,172
I wasn't trying to make you guys fight over me or anything
bad like that... but you were just so nice to me...

190
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:04,303
and now I can't decide who I like!

191
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:07,154
I don't remember any of this from the report.

192
00:10:07,179 --> 00:10:09,209
Maybe it happened a while ago...

193
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:11,592
Why are you trying to pretend like you don't remember?!

194
00:10:11,617 --> 00:10:12,769
What, are you making fun of me?!

195
00:10:12,794 --> 00:10:13,674
Don't be silly.

196
00:10:13,699 --> 00:10:15,442
I would never make fun of you, buddy-ron.

197
00:10:15,467 --> 00:10:17,602
It sure as heck sounds like you are to me!

198
00:10:17,818 --> 00:10:21,127
I'm heartbroken... You jerk... You're gonna pay!

199
00:10:21,152 --> 00:10:23,754
Too slow! I could easily beat this guy-ggh!

200
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:27,347
Huh?

201
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:31,797
Huh... That was a pretty good punch,
but it's still kinda flimsy if you ask me.

202
00:10:31,973 --> 00:10:35,203
You're never gonna knock out the king
of Doki-Melo High with an arm like that.

203
00:10:36,105 --> 00:10:37,306
Uh, Kanie...

204
00:10:37,331 --> 00:10:38,118
What's up?

205
00:10:38,212 --> 00:10:39,893
Your head is sort of uh...

206
00:10:40,193 --> 00:10:42,291
Hm? Oh jeez, you're right.

207
00:10:43,781 --> 00:10:45,918
Anyway, what was I just talking about?

208
00:10:47,922 --> 00:10:48,932
See ya...

209
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,230
Um, are you sure you're okay?

210
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:52,696
Oh, yeah I'm alright...

211
00:10:52,721 --> 00:10:54,577
Just really flexible, is all.

212
00:10:54,602 --> 00:10:56,436
I-I guess that makes sense... Good to hear.

213
00:10:56,514 --> 00:11:00,717
This girl's got serious issues
if she's willing to believe that.

214
00:11:01,344 --> 00:11:04,766
I'm sorry, Kanie. You didn't do anything to deserve that.

215
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:05,735
Don't sweat it...

216
00:11:05,902 --> 00:11:07,615
Everybody makes mistakes, don't they?

217
00:11:07,975 --> 00:11:08,510
But I...

218
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:09,756
Look honey-ron,

219
00:11:09,781 --> 00:11:12,238
I learned a lot about this
kinda thing from being divorced...

220
00:11:12,263 --> 00:11:13,701
D... divorced?!

221
00:11:13,726 --> 00:11:16,748
It's always better if you can have
a third party for your arguments.

222
00:11:17,661 --> 00:11:21,814
If it's just the two of you fighting about it,
you tend to get emotional and not solve anything.

223
00:11:22,466 --> 00:11:23,109
Oh...

224
00:11:23,347 --> 00:11:27,663
Find a friend both of you trust and discuss
everything over coffee or something like that.

225
00:11:28,202 --> 00:11:31,395
You're less likely to lose your
cool in front of a friend. Bye!

226
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,182
One more thing, Kanie!

227
00:11:33,536 --> 00:11:36,288
That could've been really bad if
you hadn't stepped in like that.

228
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,069
Thank you so much!

229
00:11:38,391 --> 00:11:41,946
Don't bow... It makes you look weak
and you're a lot stronger than that.

230
00:11:43,687 --> 00:11:44,306
Right!

231
00:11:44,667 --> 00:11:46,831
You didn't have any catastrophes then?

232
00:11:47,021 --> 00:11:51,500
Well, I did have a few hiccups here and there, but I
don't think it was anything worth getting concerned about.

233
00:11:51,612 --> 00:11:53,122
Tomorrow's my turn!

234
00:11:53,147 --> 00:11:57,045
This really takes me back to my days
at Wakuwaku Garden High School-mii!

235
00:11:57,093 --> 00:12:00,830
Oh wow, Tiramy-ron, I had no idea you
went to such a competitive high school!

236
00:12:01,008 --> 00:12:04,875
If I remember correctly, that school
had some kind of explosion years ago.

237
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:07,524
Yeah that may or may not have been me-mii.

238
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:12,841
I was in the science club back in high school and I used
to like to mess around with magical explosives for fun.

239
00:12:13,198 --> 00:12:17,379
But I didn't know how strong it was and it
sorta blew the whole building to kingdom come.

240
00:12:18,152 --> 00:12:20,296
I felt pretty bad about it when it happened...

241
00:12:20,713 --> 00:12:22,577
It doesn't sound like you felt bad enough.

242
00:12:22,637 --> 00:12:24,375
That's an interesting story, Tiramy.

243
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:28,478
Don't encourage him. You'd better hope
you don't blow up Kanie's school or else.

244
00:12:28,507 --> 00:12:31,893
Don't worry, I know exactly how
to think like a high school boy-mii!

245
00:12:43,873 --> 00:12:44,938
Hot damn!

246
00:12:44,971 --> 00:12:47,827
This place is just crawling with cute girls in miniskirts!

247
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,948
Ahhh, how'm I gonna behave myself-mii?

248
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,733
Um, Kanie?

249
00:12:53,194 --> 00:12:53,927
Mii?

250
00:12:54,118 --> 00:12:57,270
Um... I was hoping I could have a little chat with you.

251
00:12:57,776 --> 00:12:59,010
Do you mind?

252
00:13:02,424 --> 00:13:03,386
Yes please!

253
00:13:03,442 --> 00:13:04,358
S-sure...

254
00:13:09,003 --> 00:13:12,136
YES! Yes yes yes yes yes!

255
00:13:12,582 --> 00:13:13,982
Attaboy, Kanie!

256
00:13:14,007 --> 00:13:17,108
I never knew you were friends with such a gorgeous babe!

257
00:13:17,148 --> 00:13:19,177
I'm gonna bag her for sure-mii!

258
00:13:19,613 --> 00:13:21,113
Let me ask you something.

259
00:13:21,454 --> 00:13:22,094
Yes?

260
00:13:24,306 --> 00:13:25,950
Your name... what is it?

261
00:13:26,779 --> 00:13:29,100
My name's Kanae Tsuchida...

262
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:30,834
How could you forget already?

263
00:13:30,859 --> 00:13:32,502
Aw, I didn't forget it!

264
00:13:32,697 --> 00:13:35,558
I just like to hear you say it with your sexy voice-mii.

265
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:36,128
"Mii"?

266
00:13:36,153 --> 00:13:37,721
Yeah you. Now say it again...

267
00:13:37,863 --> 00:13:38,787
What's your name?

268
00:13:40,646 --> 00:13:42,729
Kanae... Tsuchida.

269
00:13:42,848 --> 00:13:46,214
Yeah... that was beautiful... I wanna hear it again!

270
00:13:46,239 --> 00:13:48,152
Stop teasing me, Kanie!

271
00:13:48,614 --> 00:13:53,058
No way... How could I possibly stop teasing
you when you're just so deliciously cute-mii?

272
00:13:54,151 --> 00:13:55,852
Come on... Follow mii.

273
00:13:56,858 --> 00:13:57,988
The stairway?

274
00:13:58,013 --> 00:13:58,689
Hehehe...

275
00:13:58,714 --> 00:14:01,407
I wanna go some place quiet so I can tease you more.

276
00:14:01,432 --> 00:14:01,956
Huh?

277
00:14:03,605 --> 00:14:05,153
No need to be scared-mii...

278
00:14:05,646 --> 00:14:08,067
I'll hold your hand every step of the way, okay?

279
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:14,180
Damn, that was easy, mii! This costume
is gonna come in real handy from now on!

280
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,471
Mr. Kanie?

281
00:14:15,641 --> 00:14:16,170
Mii?

282
00:14:16,539 --> 00:14:17,768
Oh... Hey Shiina.

283
00:14:18,648 --> 00:14:20,124
Um, who is she?

284
00:14:20,149 --> 00:14:22,698
Come on, do I really have to spell it out for you-mii?

285
00:14:22,771 --> 00:14:25,120
Me and this cutie are about to get busy!

286
00:14:25,145 --> 00:14:26,259
K-Kanie!

287
00:14:26,284 --> 00:14:27,337
Trust mii.

288
00:14:29,913 --> 00:14:30,900
Sorry babe...

289
00:14:30,925 --> 00:14:33,680
You're just gonna have to wait
in line for the next time... Mii!

290
00:14:33,705 --> 00:14:36,249
That's gross! How can you talk like that?!

291
00:14:36,523 --> 00:14:37,927
You'll be sorry.

292
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:41,461
I'm telling Miss Sento!

293
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,428
Shiina's acting weird today-mii.

294
00:14:43,513 --> 00:14:45,692
Kanie, how do you know that girl?

295
00:14:45,717 --> 00:14:47,707
She's just some chick I work with-mii.

296
00:14:47,779 --> 00:14:50,088
Anyway, I think we're alone now so why don't you...

297
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:51,146
What now-mii?

298
00:14:51,171 --> 00:14:54,676
I don't know what to think of you saying
"mii" every 10 seconds like that, Kanie.

299
00:14:54,701 --> 00:14:58,870
Who cares-mii? Now come over here and
let me show you the meaning of pleasure-mii!

300
00:14:58,895 --> 00:15:01,253
What kind of relationship do you have with her?

301
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:05,948
Plus, isn't Sento that quiet girl who's
been really friendly with you lately?

302
00:15:05,973 --> 00:15:08,027
Does that make me girlfriend number 3?

303
00:15:08,052 --> 00:15:11,025
Listen baby, the whole thing's
pretty complicated, alright?

304
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:13,456
You've been acting really weird
these past couple of days...

305
00:15:13,481 --> 00:15:16,785
I'm starting to get the idea you mess
around with girls' hearts all the time.

306
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:18,945
And I just thought you were more trustworthy than that.

307
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:22,289
I am trustworthy! I promise I can be faithful-mii!

308
00:15:22,804 --> 00:15:25,073
Okay... Then what's my name?

309
00:15:25,098 --> 00:15:26,203
Ah...

310
00:15:26,287 --> 00:15:27,258
Uh...

311
00:15:27,953 --> 00:15:29,815
It's uh... Sanae!

312
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,885
I'm going home.

313
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:34,467
But I was so close...

314
00:15:34,932 --> 00:15:35,446
Mii...

315
00:15:35,816 --> 00:15:37,239
Nothing happened at all?

316
00:15:37,657 --> 00:15:38,471
You're sure?

317
00:15:38,496 --> 00:15:42,496
Something almost happened, but rest
assured, absolutely nothing happened.

318
00:15:42,521 --> 00:15:43,326
Well that's good.

319
00:15:43,351 --> 00:15:44,715
You're next, Lord Moffle.

320
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,913
High school...

321
00:15:45,938 --> 00:15:47,840
That sure brings back memories.

322
00:15:47,993 --> 00:15:52,315
I went to a strict boarding school
called Fuwafuwa Military Academy.

323
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:54,269
The upperclassmen were all so...

324
00:15:54,294 --> 00:15:55,037
I've heard enough.

325
00:15:55,062 --> 00:15:55,655
Moff?

326
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,488
Just get through it with no trouble.

327
00:16:02,448 --> 00:16:04,130
What the moff is going on?

328
00:16:04,155 --> 00:16:07,071
I don't know. They just asked us to meet them here.

329
00:16:07,096 --> 00:16:08,426
Kanie and Sento...

330
00:16:08,451 --> 00:16:12,173
I heard one of my classmates got
her feelings hurt by you two jerks.

331
00:16:12,261 --> 00:16:13,870
And what's that weird thing on your head?

332
00:16:14,303 --> 00:16:15,730
Moff-just ignore it...

333
00:16:15,755 --> 00:16:17,879
Anyway, I don't understand what you're mad about...

334
00:16:17,925 --> 00:16:18,688
Don't play dumb!

335
00:16:19,002 --> 00:16:21,810
It's okay Terano, it really doesn't bother me that much.

336
00:16:21,835 --> 00:16:22,971
Doesn't bother you?

337
00:16:22,996 --> 00:16:26,300
I thought you said this guy tried to put
the moves on you in the stairwell yesterday!

338
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:31,228
That Sento girl and some first-year
named Chujo are both Kanie's girlfriends.

339
00:16:31,253 --> 00:16:33,329
They worked together to break your heart!

340
00:16:33,431 --> 00:16:35,899
But I... but I never said that!

341
00:16:36,007 --> 00:16:37,686
But that's pretty much what happened.

342
00:16:37,821 --> 00:16:43,585
That's ridiculous! I swear upon the Goddess Libra
that Kanie and I have done no such thing to this girl!

343
00:16:43,687 --> 00:16:47,315
And you expect me to believe that? Besides, who's Libra?

344
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:50,880
If you wish to behold the wrath
of Libra, then I'll show it to you.

345
00:16:51,204 --> 00:16:52,213
What are you doing?

346
00:16:52,238 --> 00:16:53,222
Hold it... moff.

347
00:16:53,427 --> 00:16:54,424
Are you sure?

348
00:16:54,725 --> 00:16:55,740
What's with the "moff" thing?

349
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:56,383
Let me handle this.

350
00:16:56,407 --> 00:16:57,615
Whatever, I don't care.

351
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,724
Just hurry up and apologize to Kanae. Right now!

352
00:16:59,781 --> 00:17:00,602
I'm sorry.

353
00:17:00,638 --> 00:17:03,888
Eh, moff, who cares about the kid's pride, anyway?

354
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:06,215
No way. I want you to grovel!

355
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,687
Okay... how's this?

356
00:17:07,712 --> 00:17:08,676
Too easy!

357
00:17:08,821 --> 00:17:09,861
Where's your pride?

358
00:17:09,893 --> 00:17:12,032
Don't you dare talk to her ever again!

359
00:17:12,161 --> 00:17:16,377
As moff as my witness, from the bottom
of my heart, I really do apologize.

360
00:17:16,564 --> 00:17:17,646
No... wait...

361
00:17:17,734 --> 00:17:20,028
I'm starting to think he's making fun of us.

362
00:17:20,124 --> 00:17:21,965
No, I honestly feel bad about it.

363
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:24,617
Yeah right. You're just saying whatever you have to say!

364
00:17:24,642 --> 00:17:27,471
You obviously don't care about
this poor girl's feelings for you!

365
00:17:27,496 --> 00:17:30,837
I mean nothing you've said or done
has had a shred of sincerity to it!

366
00:17:30,893 --> 00:17:33,237
It's like you knocked it off from a TV show!

367
00:17:35,211 --> 00:17:36,086
You...

368
00:17:37,251 --> 00:17:39,027
You just said the worst thing possible.

369
00:17:39,052 --> 00:17:39,595
Huh?

370
00:17:40,146 --> 00:17:43,087
Hearing the word "knock-off"
is extremely problematic for him.

371
00:17:43,112 --> 00:17:46,074
I have had enough of you
arrogant bitches and your bullshit!

372
00:17:46,718 --> 00:17:49,049
Running your mouths about love and sincerity...

373
00:17:49,113 --> 00:17:51,678
You can't just throw those
words around like they're nothing!

374
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:53,461
You're a bunch of kids!

375
00:17:53,535 --> 00:17:54,604
Don't make me laugh.

376
00:17:54,629 --> 00:17:57,157
You three don't know the first moffin' thing about love!

377
00:17:57,182 --> 00:17:58,957
Please don't get upset, Lord Moffle.

378
00:17:58,982 --> 00:18:03,796
You date some boy you barely know, you think you're
in love, then you complain about heartbreak afterwards?!

379
00:18:04,174 --> 00:18:05,746
You think life's that easy?!

380
00:18:06,306 --> 00:18:10,283
What, does it make you feel cool to pretend
to be angry for your friend's sake, is that it?

381
00:18:10,313 --> 00:18:11,779
You're full of it!

382
00:18:16,249 --> 00:18:17,077
Whoa!

383
00:18:17,537 --> 00:18:19,978
When the pain is bad enough to
make you wish you were dead...

384
00:18:20,239 --> 00:18:23,050
THAT... THAT'S what love is!

385
00:18:23,214 --> 00:18:26,815
Wait 'til the woman you've loved for over
ten years gets married to some bastard you hate!

386
00:18:26,844 --> 00:18:29,463
You can't even imagine the agony I felt that day!

387
00:18:29,531 --> 00:18:33,327
And then ten years later, she comes
and asks me to take care of her daughter?

388
00:18:33,553 --> 00:18:35,149
Do you know how that feels?!

389
00:18:35,274 --> 00:18:36,952
No! Because you're children!

390
00:18:36,979 --> 00:18:37,886
Wait a minute sir.

391
00:18:37,911 --> 00:18:40,116
Is this in reference to Princess Latifah's mother?

392
00:18:40,439 --> 00:18:42,830
Shut the moff up, it's hypothetical!

393
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:44,004
What's his problem?!

394
00:18:44,157 --> 00:18:46,015
Yeah. He's really creeping me out.

395
00:18:46,045 --> 00:18:47,455
And what does "moff" mean?

396
00:18:47,504 --> 00:18:48,696
Stop it, guys!

397
00:18:50,764 --> 00:18:51,597
Kimura!

398
00:18:52,071 --> 00:18:52,981
I'm sorry...

399
00:18:53,139 --> 00:18:55,783
The only reason Kanie acted like that was for my sake!

400
00:18:55,808 --> 00:18:56,591
Huh?!

401
00:18:57,162 --> 00:19:01,527
He said all those crazy things and acted like a
scumbag on purpose to make Tsuchida hate his guts!

402
00:19:01,862 --> 00:19:04,257
That way maybe she'd want to be with me instead!

403
00:19:05,128 --> 00:19:06,254
Right, Kanie?

404
00:19:06,335 --> 00:19:08,558
I what...? Uhhh, yeah...

405
00:19:08,637 --> 00:19:12,142
When I asked Kanie for advice about how
to patch everything up with Tsuchida...

406
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:17,202
he had a plan... He said the only way to get things
back to normal was to make her not like him anymore.

407
00:19:17,423 --> 00:19:20,192
I know this mess ended up making me look bad too...

408
00:19:20,217 --> 00:19:23,201
But I swear I'll try really
hard to be the best guy for you.

409
00:19:23,226 --> 00:19:25,473
So do you think maybe you could give me a chance?

410
00:19:25,569 --> 00:19:28,495
O-okay... If you're sure that's what you want too.

411
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:31,408
Well then if the two of you don't
have anything left to be upset over...

412
00:19:31,433 --> 00:19:33,383
I guess I have nothing to say.

413
00:19:33,474 --> 00:19:34,215
Awesome!

414
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,267
Thank you for understanding!

415
00:19:36,307 --> 00:19:37,943
It's nice to have friends, huh?

416
00:19:44,428 --> 00:19:45,924
Thanks for the heads-up, Chujo...

417
00:19:46,554 --> 00:19:48,038
It all worked out, thanks to you.

418
00:19:48,332 --> 00:19:51,512
Sure... I knew something weird must be going on...

419
00:19:51,647 --> 00:19:54,452
It's a good thing I was able to get in contact with you.

420
00:19:54,931 --> 00:19:56,165
I appreciate it.

421
00:19:56,497 --> 00:19:59,920
Hopefully I can figure out a way
to explain all this to Kimura later.

422
00:19:59,992 --> 00:20:03,096
I'm surprised you didn't get mad
at Mr. Moffle and the other two.

423
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:06,145
You almost made a lot of enemies because of this mess.

424
00:20:06,196 --> 00:20:07,776
Nah... I'm not mad...

425
00:20:08,025 --> 00:20:10,996
Either way, those idiots only did
it because they wanted to help me out.

426
00:20:11,269 --> 00:20:12,539
How could I be mad at that?

427
00:20:14,655 --> 00:20:15,021
What?

428
00:20:15,329 --> 00:20:16,053
Oh it's nothing.

429
00:20:16,078 --> 00:20:19,880
I was just thinking how you
reacted the way I expected you would.

430
00:20:19,905 --> 00:20:20,379
Huh?

431
00:20:20,606 --> 00:20:21,780
It's no big deal...

432
00:20:21,844 --> 00:20:22,992
I gotta go!

433
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:31,887
Sento. You made it.

434
00:20:32,681 --> 00:20:34,659
It's good to see that you're back on the job...

435
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,625
I take it you've fully recovered then.

436
00:20:36,942 --> 00:20:40,764
Look at this, Lady Isuzu... Sir Kanie is very peculiar!

437
00:20:41,331 --> 00:20:42,388
Did something happen?

438
00:20:42,649 --> 00:20:47,877
Just look at the way he tries his best to preserve
the strawberry on top until the last possible moment!

439
00:20:48,427 --> 00:20:49,589
What? Is that weird?

440
00:20:50,009 --> 00:20:52,923
You appear to be healthy enough
to return to school tomorrow.

441
00:20:53,394 --> 00:20:55,333
Oh yeah. I'm perfectly fine now...

442
00:20:55,413 --> 00:20:56,668
Sorry for the trouble. Sento.

443
00:20:57,252 --> 00:21:00,622
No... I probably wasn't of
very much help to you in the end.

444
00:21:00,747 --> 00:21:02,898
In fact, I may have caused YOU trouble.

445
00:21:04,133 --> 00:21:07,006
Well, you can fill me in later... Are you hungry?

446
00:21:07,545 --> 00:21:09,241
Yes, we have croquettes!

447
00:21:09,388 --> 00:21:10,313
Thank you.

448
00:21:10,601 --> 00:21:13,750
Speaking of which, I've thought of a new croquette recipe!

449
00:21:14,152 --> 00:21:19,561
If I add sugar to the batter... they'll be even more
appealing to visitors with a sweet tooth won't they?

450
00:21:19,764 --> 00:21:23,365
Sounds good... I think the Maple
Kitchen could benefit from a new menu item.

451
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:28,677
Then would it be alright if you sampled the new recipe to
make sure it's perfect before we serve it to the guests?

452
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:30,952
Oh I get it. So I'm a guinea pig now.

453
00:21:30,977 --> 00:21:33,184
Oh no...! I didn't mean it that way!

454
00:21:34,091 --> 00:21:34,939
It's fine.

455
00:21:34,964 --> 00:21:37,535
Then I'll go ahead and make a
few first thing in the morning.

456
00:21:37,835 --> 00:21:38,978
Can't wait to try 'em.

457
00:21:39,003 --> 00:21:39,802
Perfect!

458
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:41,403
I'm sure you'll like them.

459
00:22:08,575 --> 00:22:10,629
It's not good enough!

460
00:23:43,123 --> 00:23:45,145
Time for the attractions spotlight.

461
00:23:46,098 --> 00:23:48,328
Today's feature is Save the Earth.

462
00:23:48,414 --> 00:23:51,198
It's a fun-filled presentation about Earth science.

463
00:23:51,476 --> 00:23:53,967
Oh okay, so it's like a documentary type thing?

464
00:23:54,113 --> 00:23:59,462
Sort of. The audience experiences a lengthy
lecture from Future the globe about the many ways...

465
00:23:59,487 --> 00:24:01,885
in which humanity destroys our precious planet.

466
00:24:01,918 --> 00:24:03,878
That doesn't sound fun at all.

467
00:24:03,916 --> 00:24:07,635
And then after the show, he demands a
2,000 yen donation from each visitor.

468
00:24:07,701 --> 00:24:09,365
We should shut that down!
