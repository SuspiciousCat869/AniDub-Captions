1
00:00:07,108 --> 00:00:08,781
Oh, no, it's all right.

2
00:00:08,806 --> 00:00:10,977
I just got a little dizzy and fell down.

3
00:00:11,314 --> 00:00:12,197
I was worried.

4
00:00:12,532 --> 00:00:14,268
I heard you fainted, so I came running.

5
00:00:15,806 --> 00:00:18,812
Everyone here can be so dramatic sometimes.

6
00:00:19,366 --> 00:00:22,108
But I do appreciate you being concerned for me.

7
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:25,210
As you might've guessed,

8
00:00:25,235 --> 00:00:27,495
Her Majesty's health is in critical condition.

9
00:00:28,816 --> 00:00:29,724
Let me guess:

10
00:00:29,749 --> 00:00:32,127
Because I made her go out in that stupid swimsuit, right?

11
00:00:33,278 --> 00:00:34,965
I don't think that's it.

12
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:37,958
Listen...

13
00:00:39,616 --> 00:00:41,525
This does happen from time to time,

14
00:00:41,568 --> 00:00:42,981
so keep it in mind.

15
00:02:15,245 --> 00:02:20,031
Ron-ron-ron...

16
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:23,793
Mi, mi, miii!

17
00:02:23,876 --> 00:02:27,441
Moff, moff, moff... Moff!

18
00:02:28,168 --> 00:02:31,066
Perfect, the mascots are really stepping up their game.

19
00:02:31,225 --> 00:02:34,789
That's true, but some of them aren't
quite as motivated as the others.

20
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,544
Please tell me the visitor count's up today.

21
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,589
It's rising. The 30 yen campaign must be working.

22
00:02:42,614 --> 00:02:43,703
Huh?

23
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:47,871
Incoming!

24
00:02:49,133 --> 00:02:50,674
Field trip!

25
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,094
Let's beat 'em up!

26
00:02:54,683 --> 00:02:57,005
Field trip groups are always a challenge.

27
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:58,878
This is brutal.

28
00:02:59,678 --> 00:03:00,444
We should help.

29
00:03:01,844 --> 00:03:02,526
You okay?

30
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:04,035
Yes.

31
00:03:04,469 --> 00:03:06,560
They're the same as any other customers.

32
00:03:07,289 --> 00:03:08,930
What? Is this too hard for you?

33
00:03:09,198 --> 00:03:11,224
Of course not! Don't be ridiculous.

34
00:03:11,546 --> 00:03:12,615
You just watch.

35
00:03:14,383 --> 00:03:16,095
Thank you for visiting Amabri.

36
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,016
Is there anything I can help you with?

37
00:03:18,313 --> 00:03:20,063
A girl!

38
00:03:22,591 --> 00:03:23,837
Gimme, lady!

39
00:03:27,281 --> 00:03:30,589
Hurry, there's a long list of
issues that need to be addressed.

40
00:03:30,689 --> 00:03:31,829
I am hurrying.

41
00:03:32,886 --> 00:03:35,714
We have to see the Sales
Department about the new info board...

42
00:03:35,795 --> 00:03:37,816
I know. We're on the way.

43
00:03:38,655 --> 00:03:39,282
Oh...

44
00:03:40,581 --> 00:03:42,639
I apologize for troubling you.

45
00:03:42,664 --> 00:03:45,237
I just wanted to talk about the new info board.

46
00:03:45,362 --> 00:03:46,678
Do you have a design yet?

47
00:03:47,054 --> 00:03:49,626
Yes, I've got five drafts right here.

48
00:03:56,594 --> 00:03:57,613
None of these work.

49
00:03:57,831 --> 00:03:59,909
Huh?! Oh, dear...

50
00:04:00,385 --> 00:04:03,585
But, Kanie, it took him a whole
week to create those designs.

51
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,331
Let me try.

52
00:04:04,615 --> 00:04:06,141
See, this is how you need to do it.

53
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:10,434
One... two... three. Much better!

54
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:11,992
Oh my, yes!

55
00:04:12,017 --> 00:04:13,427
I quite agree.

56
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,875
I bow to your superior expertise!

57
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,566
You can iron out the details.

58
00:04:17,792 --> 00:04:19,218
Hurry up, Sento, let's go.

59
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:23,505
Jeez, Manager, what took ya so long?

60
00:04:23,644 --> 00:04:25,653
Sorry. So, how's the stock?

61
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:28,333
This is all we've got left.

62
00:04:29,203 --> 00:04:31,715
At this rate, we're gonna be outta food by next week!

63
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,992
And the usual supplier couldn't
do anything to help us out.

64
00:04:35,017 --> 00:04:37,540
Okay, then we'll just have to look for a new supplier.

65
00:04:37,582 --> 00:04:39,403
We should try to come up with a solution before next we...

66
00:04:39,428 --> 00:04:40,661
Amagi Brilliant Park...

67
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,915
This is Kanie. I spoke with you before.

68
00:04:43,103 --> 00:04:44,778
We do need your help after all.

69
00:04:45,042 --> 00:04:47,022
I'll pass the phone to the chief of food service.

70
00:04:47,063 --> 00:04:47,569
Huh?

71
00:04:47,995 --> 00:04:49,648
Go on, order what you need.

72
00:04:49,745 --> 00:04:51,500
Uh, thanks I guess.

73
00:04:51,654 --> 00:04:52,958
Keep moving, Sento.

74
00:04:54,565 --> 00:04:57,517
Some expenses on the budget estimate might be...

75
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,442
a little unnecessary.

76
00:04:59,776 --> 00:05:00,767
And what are those?

77
00:05:00,862 --> 00:05:03,131
All of these have to do with costume repair.

78
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,134
If you look at...

79
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:09,807
So you mean this, this, and this?

80
00:05:10,696 --> 00:05:11,551
Yes, sir.

81
00:05:12,046 --> 00:05:14,152
It's not unnecessary. Leave it on there.

82
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:16,264
Right, I'll do that.

83
00:05:16,512 --> 00:05:17,474
What's next?

84
00:05:19,532 --> 00:05:23,099
These ol' pumps are startin' to get
mighty rickety here lately, Manager.

85
00:05:23,124 --> 00:05:24,689
Then, we'll contact the manufacturer...

86
00:05:24,714 --> 00:05:28,353
We're too broke. Shut one of them down
and use the parts to run the other two.

87
00:05:28,591 --> 00:05:29,611
Are you sure?

88
00:05:29,716 --> 00:05:31,349
What'll we do if something goes wrong?

89
00:05:31,374 --> 00:05:32,616
That's a problem for later.

90
00:05:32,993 --> 00:05:34,552
Whatever you say, boss.

91
00:05:34,581 --> 00:05:35,240
Next!

92
00:05:35,741 --> 00:05:38,075
We're running out of space for merchandise.

93
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,602
This spot's free. Move it all there.

94
00:05:42,223 --> 00:05:44,273
Our security equipment is broken.

95
00:05:45,355 --> 00:05:46,223
No, it isn't!

96
00:05:47,086 --> 00:05:49,591
The guests don't like the liver and chive stir-fry.

97
00:05:49,662 --> 00:05:51,286
Change the recipe!

98
00:05:52,372 --> 00:05:54,802
His favorite pop star spent the night with a man.

99
00:05:55,163 --> 00:05:57,167
Toss out the damn magazine.

100
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,428
What's next on the agenda?

101
00:06:02,215 --> 00:06:06,440
Finishing this stack of paperwork, and then
a meeting about which attractions to renew.

102
00:06:06,822 --> 00:06:08,629
A meeting? Who's going?

103
00:06:08,914 --> 00:06:11,164
Just Moffle, Macaron, and Tiramy.

104
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:14,164
Great, those three. Maybe I'll leave the meeting to you.

105
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:15,440
Are you sure?

106
00:06:15,568 --> 00:06:16,998
I'm exhausted as it is.

107
00:06:17,023 --> 00:06:18,985
I don't have the energy for those clowns today.

108
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:20,994
Just Let me take care of the paperwork.

109
00:06:21,164 --> 00:06:22,143
As you wish.

110
00:06:23,745 --> 00:06:24,826
Hey, Sento?

111
00:06:27,078 --> 00:06:29,218
Try to make everything go smoothly, okay?

112
00:06:29,316 --> 00:06:30,184
You understand?

113
00:06:30,964 --> 00:06:33,115
I don't need you to explain that to me.

114
00:06:34,717 --> 00:06:36,090
Huh? You okay, Sento?

115
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:39,746
What's her problem?

116
00:06:43,741 --> 00:06:45,718
Um, excuse us, sir!

117
00:06:45,824 --> 00:06:47,754
The door's open; Come on in.

118
00:06:49,106 --> 00:06:49,961
Uh...

119
00:06:52,823 --> 00:06:53,502
What's up?

120
00:06:54,495 --> 00:06:57,870
Well, uh, it's kind of a sensitive problem, sir,

121
00:06:57,895 --> 00:07:00,307
but we were hoping we could talk to you for a minute?

122
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:04,032
Actually, I'm pretty busy figuring
out all this paperwork right now.

123
00:07:04,226 --> 00:07:06,440
Maybe you should go talk to Sento about it?

124
00:07:06,664 --> 00:07:09,559
Nah, if we could talk to her, then
we wouldn't have bothered with you.

125
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,624
Oh, no, she didn't mean that the way it sounded!

126
00:07:12,673 --> 00:07:14,885
We just wanted to come speak to you directly.

127
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:15,920
So what's the problem?

128
00:07:15,945 --> 00:07:18,520
Uh, well, you see, sir, it's just that, um...

129
00:07:19,018 --> 00:07:23,113
All right fine, you win. You just tell me what you want.

130
00:07:23,138 --> 00:07:25,952
Okay, let's see, how can I explain this delicately?

131
00:07:26,103 --> 00:07:29,146
Um, maybe we'd better let him see it for himself.

132
00:07:29,262 --> 00:07:30,961
Oh, that's a good idea!

133
00:07:31,771 --> 00:07:33,515
Can we borrow you for a bit, sir?

134
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,974
This is embarrassing.

135
00:07:35,999 --> 00:07:37,495
It's all busted up!

136
00:07:37,694 --> 00:07:41,119
What's it gonna take to convince
you to invest in some new equipment?!

137
00:07:41,144 --> 00:07:43,397
I can't. I told you we don't have the money.

138
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:48,415
Come on! The kids aren't gonna wanna
play with an old broken water gun like this!

139
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,478
As a mascot, you have control over the guests' experience.

140
00:07:51,503 --> 00:07:53,703
You'll just have to blow them away with your charisma.

141
00:07:53,728 --> 00:07:55,044
"Blow them away"?!

142
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:59,587
And I have more than enough of these bullets to go around.

143
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:00,836
Moffu...

144
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,777
I can't work like this!

145
00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:08,064
My accordi-ron broke and I need a new one!

146
00:08:08,097 --> 00:08:10,895
No, make do with your other instruments.

147
00:08:11,059 --> 00:08:14,613
Aw, man! But the whole audience
is gonna run for the hills!

148
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:17,923
Well, if that happens, then
you'll just have to run them down.

149
00:08:18,026 --> 00:08:19,234
"Run them down"?

150
00:08:19,805 --> 00:08:22,795
I want you to take your job seriously. Got that?

151
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,146
Ron...

152
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,321
Hey, look at this!

153
00:08:30,372 --> 00:08:31,872
What are you asking for?

154
00:08:31,897 --> 00:08:34,128
Oops, wrong thing. Here!

155
00:08:34,704 --> 00:08:37,669
This talking flower broke. I think it might be dead!

156
00:08:38,581 --> 00:08:40,239
Maybe we can save it!

157
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:42,270
No we can't. Deal with it.

158
00:08:42,434 --> 00:08:43,791
But... but...

159
00:08:43,816 --> 00:08:45,179
I said deal.

160
00:08:46,065 --> 00:08:47,716
Bon appetit? Oui!

161
00:08:48,049 --> 00:08:49,749
She's been acting weird!

162
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,841
We can't ask her for anything.

163
00:08:52,089 --> 00:08:53,161
What's this about?

164
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:56,003
Nothing, nothing at all!

165
00:08:56,171 --> 00:08:58,078
We were only making conversation!

166
00:08:58,348 --> 00:09:00,306
I'll listen to all your complaints.

167
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,424
There's no need for you to bother Kanie.

168
00:09:02,724 --> 00:09:04,866
We didn't! We just wanted to...

169
00:09:06,729 --> 00:09:08,434
Sento, let's talk.

170
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:09,513
Comment allez-vous?

171
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:13,360
I told you to make sure things went smoothly.

172
00:09:13,631 --> 00:09:16,563
Right, I prevented any conflicts from arising.

173
00:09:17,229 --> 00:09:20,230
Prevented? You just threatened them all into submission.

174
00:09:20,521 --> 00:09:22,934
Just like the time you forced me to come to this park.

175
00:09:24,121 --> 00:09:25,388
You can't threaten people.

176
00:09:25,753 --> 00:09:27,755
You have to find a way to compromise with them.

177
00:09:28,255 --> 00:09:30,784
What you're doing is oppressive and it has to stop.

178
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:34,195
What? Don't you think you're being oppressive too?!

179
00:09:34,547 --> 00:09:37,458
Oh, I am, but I make sure they understand the reason why.

180
00:09:40,033 --> 00:09:44,205
I sure hope this isn't the way you handled
conflicts when you were the acting manager for a year.

181
00:09:44,966 --> 00:09:46,685
You think that's any of your business?!

182
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:47,403
Yes!

183
00:09:48,316 --> 00:09:49,683
You're my secretary now.

184
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:52,617
I'm not gonna let you keep dragging me down like this.

185
00:09:53,608 --> 00:09:55,964
You think that I drag you down?

186
00:09:56,714 --> 00:09:57,471
Really?

187
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,545
At this rate, yeah.

188
00:10:05,024 --> 00:10:08,718
Okay, then what else can I possibly be doing?!

189
00:10:10,146 --> 00:10:11,278
Sento...

190
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:17,656
Sento, wait!

191
00:10:19,649 --> 00:10:21,359
Seriously, what's her deal?

192
00:10:46,501 --> 00:10:47,996
Yes? Come in.

193
00:10:49,401 --> 00:10:50,975
Latifah, are you...

194
00:10:52,427 --> 00:10:54,201
Oh, S-Sir Kanie?!

195
00:10:54,301 --> 00:10:56,186
Oh, crap... Sorry.

196
00:10:56,534 --> 00:10:57,521
It's all right.

197
00:10:59,695 --> 00:11:01,044
You surprised me.

198
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,419
Are you feeling any better, ma'am?

199
00:11:03,554 --> 00:11:05,453
I've been getting a little restless in here,

200
00:11:05,482 --> 00:11:08,472
so I was just about to go
outside and take in some fresh air.

201
00:11:08,908 --> 00:11:10,944
Oh, okay, that sounds like a good idea.

202
00:11:12,535 --> 00:11:16,075
Well, actually, would you mind
giving me a moment of your time, please?

203
00:11:18,334 --> 00:11:20,774
This old ride is still so lovely.

204
00:11:20,937 --> 00:11:21,932
Yeah...

205
00:11:21,957 --> 00:11:24,240
I've wanted to ride it with you for a while now.

206
00:11:24,445 --> 00:11:26,734
It almost feels like we're out on a date.

207
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:28,105
Uh, I guess so...

208
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:30,195
Look, there's the main entrance.

209
00:11:31,777 --> 00:11:33,865
Oh, and there's Etcet Land.

210
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:34,567
Uh-huh...

211
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:37,134
And Wild Valley's right next to it, and...

212
00:11:37,234 --> 00:11:37,917
Yeah...

213
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,442
Uh, are you all right there?

214
00:11:42,467 --> 00:11:43,260
Sure I am.

215
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:45,709
Man, just look at that view!

216
00:11:46,152 --> 00:11:47,609
Is it possible you're afraid of...

217
00:11:47,642 --> 00:11:51,315
No way! As if somebody as awesome
as me would have that problem!

218
00:12:02,268 --> 00:12:03,357
Sir Kanie?

219
00:12:07,027 --> 00:12:12,614
S-sorry, but to tell the truth
I'm extremely afraid of heights.

220
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,393
There's no need to fear.

221
00:12:17,601 --> 00:12:18,935
Try to relax.

222
00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:25,848
I'm so sorry. If I had known about this,

223
00:12:25,873 --> 00:12:27,752
I wouldn't have asked you to come with me.

224
00:12:28,612 --> 00:12:30,139
My ego got the best of me.

225
00:12:30,172 --> 00:12:31,489
It wasn't your fault.

226
00:12:31,902 --> 00:12:32,733
But...

227
00:12:32,765 --> 00:12:35,352
Anyway, you think we could just keep this between us?

228
00:12:35,524 --> 00:12:36,432
Of course.

229
00:12:37,847 --> 00:12:41,072
Wouldn't it be pertinent to at
least tell Lady Isuzu about it?

230
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:43,710
Are you kidding me?! especially not her!

231
00:12:44,021 --> 00:12:45,688
Ah, right.

232
00:12:48,698 --> 00:12:51,820
I apologize for laughing, it's just so funny...

233
00:12:58,968 --> 00:13:00,051
Hey, Latifah?

234
00:13:00,226 --> 00:13:00,933
Yes?

235
00:13:01,172 --> 00:13:03,777
Is there some chance we knew each other a long time ago?

236
00:13:04,765 --> 00:13:06,734
You're asking if we've met before?

237
00:13:06,794 --> 00:13:07,454
Yeah.

238
00:13:10,402 --> 00:13:12,644
I'm sorry, I don't think so.

239
00:13:16,867 --> 00:13:18,197
Nothing's happened.

240
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:21,201
Let's keep watching just in case.

241
00:13:21,569 --> 00:13:23,133
She's not safe out here.

242
00:13:23,214 --> 00:13:24,253
Yeah, right.

243
00:13:24,278 --> 00:13:27,350
You just don't like that she's up
there alone with the manager-ron.

244
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,223
Hey.

245
00:14:01,368 --> 00:14:02,737
So much rain...

246
00:14:03,365 --> 00:14:05,292
It's kind of unusual, isn't it?

247
00:14:05,317 --> 00:14:07,379
At least, we can take a little break right now.

248
00:14:07,462 --> 00:14:10,051
Yeah, but we can't get visitors if the park's rained out!

249
00:14:10,076 --> 00:14:14,044
Hey, you're a water spirit, aren't
you, sweet stuff? Stop the rain, mii!

250
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:17,281
I can't. All I can do is cute
little tricks like this. Miiii!

251
00:14:17,306 --> 00:14:19,385
Bad news! Bad news!

252
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:20,702
BAD NEWS!

253
00:14:20,956 --> 00:14:23,413
What's wrong with you? You're gonna rust!

254
00:14:24,469 --> 00:14:26,434
It's the drainage system!

255
00:14:28,053 --> 00:14:30,916
Bucket o' bolts gave out on me with all this rain.

256
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:34,632
If it keeps up, the underground
facilities are gonna flood!

257
00:14:34,973 --> 00:14:35,589
What?!

258
00:14:36,034 --> 00:14:37,356
That's terrible!

259
00:14:37,381 --> 00:14:39,498
We'd have to close down for a month!

260
00:14:39,697 --> 00:14:41,947
Why did these things have to quit NOW of all times?

261
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:45,531
Uh, boss? We talked about this yesterday.

262
00:14:45,556 --> 00:14:47,833
You told me to shut one of 'em down.

263
00:14:48,405 --> 00:14:50,187
What'll we do if something goes wrong?

264
00:14:50,212 --> 00:14:52,700
So that must've made the other two pumps work too hard.

265
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,076
Yeah, I reckon.

266
00:14:55,167 --> 00:14:57,676
We have to do something about this, and fast!

267
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,397
I know!

268
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:01,219
We'd better move all the merchandise first.

269
00:15:01,729 --> 00:15:03,422
No wait, safety's more important.

270
00:15:04,068 --> 00:15:08,190
Either way, we have to stop it before it
floods or we'll be done before we can even reopen.

271
00:15:08,321 --> 00:15:10,267
We'll set up an emergency base.

272
00:15:12,527 --> 00:15:13,401
Sento!

273
00:15:15,213 --> 00:15:17,503
Everything's ready. Just come with me.

274
00:15:21,728 --> 00:15:25,225
We'll need fire extinguishing
pumps in ten crucial locations.

275
00:15:25,769 --> 00:15:29,352
This is the Music Theater. We've got the pumps, Isuzu-ron!

276
00:15:29,534 --> 00:15:33,627
Flood control units, please continue
the bucket relay until the pumps arrive.

277
00:15:34,918 --> 00:15:37,766
In the meantime, use sandbags to prevent more flooding.

278
00:15:37,928 --> 00:15:41,730
Facilities Unit! We stopped
the 4th corridor from goin' under!

279
00:15:41,893 --> 00:15:44,403
Now head for the west side of the 5th corridor.

280
00:15:44,428 --> 00:15:45,286
Ten-four!

281
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:46,802
All the pumps have been set up.

282
00:15:47,009 --> 00:15:47,955
Excellent.

283
00:15:48,507 --> 00:15:50,651
Ready? Begin drainage!

284
00:15:51,088 --> 00:15:52,026
Roger!

285
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,452
Please begin drainage!

286
00:15:53,481 --> 00:15:55,100
Begin drainage!

287
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:56,037
Ron!

288
00:15:56,319 --> 00:15:57,234
Mii!

289
00:15:57,584 --> 00:15:59,531
Now, let's do this!

290
00:16:02,465 --> 00:16:04,586
Th-this is the Elementario Unit!

291
00:16:04,611 --> 00:16:07,040
We've been keeping up the bucket relay for a while now.

292
00:16:07,065 --> 00:16:09,428
Could you please send us a pump as soon as you can?

293
00:16:09,825 --> 00:16:13,203
We can't afford to move the pumps
away from the badly affected areas.

294
00:16:13,228 --> 00:16:14,828
I'll send security over.

295
00:16:15,292 --> 00:16:16,544
Go help them, Okuro.

296
00:16:16,973 --> 00:16:17,800
Yes, ma'am!

297
00:16:18,238 --> 00:16:20,775
Hold on for another 20 minutes.

298
00:16:21,535 --> 00:16:23,920
Miss Isuzu, the unit's immobilized!

299
00:16:23,945 --> 00:16:25,491
Don't abandon your post. If you do, I'll gun you down.

300
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:29,496
Hey, Ashe, let me take over here while you
go get everyone some food and a place to rest.

301
00:16:29,565 --> 00:16:30,461
Yes, sir.

302
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,685
Facilities Unit to HQ, the
drainage system's back in business!

303
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:57,923
Repeat, the drainage system's back in business!

304
00:16:58,808 --> 00:17:00,012
Message received.

305
00:17:02,831 --> 00:17:04,047
Well, good work.

306
00:17:04,412 --> 00:17:06,276
Nah, I can't take the credit.

307
00:17:06,582 --> 00:17:08,751
Good job, Miss Former Manager.

308
00:17:09,622 --> 00:17:11,962
Well, I better get back to work. Over and out.

309
00:17:21,344 --> 00:17:22,666
No issues over here.

310
00:17:23,233 --> 00:17:23,882
Good.

311
00:17:24,422 --> 00:17:25,745
Is this the of 'em?

312
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:26,628
That's right.

313
00:17:29,997 --> 00:17:31,155
Look, Kanie...

314
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:31,799
Uh-huh?

315
00:17:32,367 --> 00:17:34,723
I don't exactly have a problem with you.

316
00:17:35,338 --> 00:17:36,054
No?

317
00:17:37,066 --> 00:17:39,517
The problem is with me, actually.

318
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:44,299
Before this, I worked as the acting
manager of Amagi Brilliant Park.

319
00:17:45,953 --> 00:17:50,160
Since I was a soldier, I thought I
could solve every problem with brute force.

320
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:52,416
"Soldier"?

321
00:17:53,043 --> 00:17:54,892
I'm a member of the Royal Guard.

322
00:17:55,396 --> 00:17:59,706
I grew up in a military household, so I
never thought twice about becoming a soldier.

323
00:18:00,654 --> 00:18:04,321
I came here because I was
commanded to re-energize this park.

324
00:18:04,748 --> 00:18:06,410
That's kind of a tall order, isn't it?

325
00:18:07,876 --> 00:18:09,110
Yes, it is.

326
00:18:09,804 --> 00:18:10,852
And I knew that.

327
00:18:11,086 --> 00:18:13,784
I knew I wasn't cut out for a mission like this.

328
00:18:15,206 --> 00:18:15,849
But...

329
00:18:17,018 --> 00:18:21,263
I didn't want to disappoint or dishonor
my family, so I did my best anyway.

330
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,212
And I failed.

331
00:18:29,277 --> 00:18:32,455
So I take it that was your first
big setback as a member of the elite.

332
00:18:32,974 --> 00:18:35,382
A setback? Perhaps.

333
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:39,155
Then, why didn't you just run away and
forget what your family wanted you to do?

334
00:18:40,489 --> 00:18:41,279
Sento?

335
00:18:42,096 --> 00:18:42,909
Run away?

336
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:45,214
That never even crossed my mind.

337
00:18:45,313 --> 00:18:46,248
Jeez...

338
00:18:46,407 --> 00:18:49,107
Well, in any case, I ended up failing.

339
00:18:50,347 --> 00:18:53,667
And I couldn't decide how to
reconcile that fact within myself.

340
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,549
I know the cast members all hate me now.

341
00:18:59,036 --> 00:19:01,669
You know, I've been through my share of setbacks too.

342
00:19:05,693 --> 00:19:06,729
Uh...

343
00:19:10,111 --> 00:19:12,783
The truth is I'm afraid of heights.

344
00:19:14,728 --> 00:19:17,465
Just when I was getting popular as a child actor...

345
00:19:19,418 --> 00:19:20,298
Well, I...

346
00:19:21,195 --> 00:19:23,392
I just couldn't deal with high places anymore.

347
00:19:25,362 --> 00:19:27,092
It was kinda like your thing.

348
00:19:28,572 --> 00:19:31,945
Maybe I was scared of making
my parents sad, or losing fans...

349
00:19:33,732 --> 00:19:35,631
When I look back, it doesn't make sense.

350
00:19:39,405 --> 00:19:42,281
Being afraid of heights wasn't
the only reason or anything,

351
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:44,482
but I quit show business around that time.

352
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:48,688
And of course they were disappointed and yelled,
and the whole thing caused a lot of problems.

353
00:19:49,426 --> 00:19:51,009
It wasn't a fun time.

354
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,418
It sounds difficult.

355
00:19:56,057 --> 00:19:57,659
But all of that aside...

356
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,224
My point is...

357
00:20:01,211 --> 00:20:02,604
Those setbacks...

358
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:04,709
That's all they really are!

359
00:20:05,479 --> 00:20:08,412
That kind of stupid crap happens to people every day!

360
00:20:09,055 --> 00:20:11,935
If you're upset about something
like that, then you're just weak!

361
00:20:12,423 --> 00:20:16,309
Hear me?! Weak! Right?!

362
00:20:16,817 --> 00:20:18,186
What do you think about THAT?!

363
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:25,071
I see...

364
00:20:26,567 --> 00:20:29,053
Well then, I suppose that means I'm weak.

365
00:20:29,078 --> 00:20:30,535
I'm glad you understand.

366
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:36,150
Still, I never would've expected you to tell me
about something so personal as your fear of heights.

367
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:39,389
Oh yeah, I did. That's funny.

368
00:20:40,528 --> 00:20:41,306
But why?

369
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:45,009
Oh well, now you know.

370
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:49,208
Miss Isuzu!

371
00:20:49,631 --> 00:20:51,498
That was amazing, mii!

372
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:53,998
That's our Miss Isuzu-ron!

373
00:20:55,063 --> 00:20:56,267
We're all tired,

374
00:20:56,313 --> 00:20:58,635
but we wanted to take a moment to say thank you!

375
00:21:02,399 --> 00:21:05,740
Hey, weren't you trying to tell me
earlier that all the cast members hated you?

376
00:21:06,317 --> 00:21:07,696
How do you explain this?

377
00:21:18,817 --> 00:21:20,211
Oh, I almost forgot!

378
00:21:20,273 --> 00:21:23,211
I heard you rode on the Ferris
wheel with Her Majesty yesterday.

379
00:21:23,236 --> 00:21:26,756
Ah, uh... So you know about that, huh?

380
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:28,542
Macaron told me.

381
00:21:29,493 --> 00:21:32,615
So? I assume you must've been terrified of the height?

382
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:35,364
Don't go there.

383
00:21:35,692 --> 00:21:37,387
Does that mean you've gotten over it?

384
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,473
Look, it's not important.

385
00:21:39,544 --> 00:21:41,605
It is! I'm very interested.

386
00:21:43,332 --> 00:21:44,780
Just gimme a break.

387
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:46,457
Time for the attractions spotlight.

388
00:23:47,183 --> 00:23:50,924
This is Elementario, the home of the four nature spirits.

389
00:23:50,949 --> 00:23:53,041
Can't they use their powers to make the show better?

390
00:23:53,066 --> 00:23:56,290
Not indoors. The flames would set the place on fire,

391
00:23:56,421 --> 00:24:00,309
water's difficult to clean up, and they
can't very well dig holes through the floor.

392
00:24:00,377 --> 00:24:02,150
What about Sylphy's wind magic?

393
00:24:02,334 --> 00:24:05,563
They use it sometimes, but it's so
drafty in there during the winter,

394
00:24:05,588 --> 00:24:07,549
it ends up making the audience freeze.

395
00:24:07,574 --> 00:24:08,865
Then get it fixed!
