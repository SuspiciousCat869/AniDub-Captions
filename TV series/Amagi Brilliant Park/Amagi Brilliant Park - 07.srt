1
00:00:15,454 --> 00:00:17,343
I want some ice cream!

2
00:00:24,867 --> 00:00:27,799
Hope you enjoy it! Strawberry's the best kind!

3
00:00:28,703 --> 00:00:29,830
Moff!

4
00:00:34,197 --> 00:00:36,656
Moff! Moff, moff, moff!

5
00:00:36,681 --> 00:00:38,741
Wow, did you hear that, boys and girls?

6
00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:42,694
Moffle wants to thank every one of
you for coming out to Amabri today!

7
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:47,147
Ron, ron, rooooon!

8
00:00:47,424 --> 00:00:49,171
Macaron wants to play!

9
00:00:49,525 --> 00:00:51,731
Mii, mii, miiiiii!

10
00:00:51,756 --> 00:00:53,570
Tiramy's happy too!

11
00:00:54,734 --> 00:00:56,215
Here we go!

12
00:01:05,192 --> 00:01:06,937
Still not enough turnout.

13
00:01:08,175 --> 00:01:12,658
Okay, then we're just gonna have to kick
the entertainment factor up another notch.

14
00:01:15,753 --> 00:01:18,043
That's what we're here for, isn't it?

15
00:01:23,218 --> 00:01:24,350
Definitely.

16
00:01:26,894 --> 00:01:27,767
Don't screw up.

17
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:32,161
What's wrong?

18
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:34,883
Nothing.

19
00:01:41,094 --> 00:01:43,274
Look! I see Moffle!

20
00:01:43,593 --> 00:01:44,267
Moff! Moff...

21
00:01:44,292 --> 00:01:45,269
Wow!

22
00:01:47,894 --> 00:01:50,108
I wanna go get a closer look at him!

23
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:53,132
A shark?

24
00:01:53,418 --> 00:01:55,398
I wonder if he's part of the show too?

25
00:03:39,634 --> 00:03:41,085
Why would you do that, Jaw?

26
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,618
I thought I told you to always stay behind the scenes!

27
00:03:44,302 --> 00:03:45,934
I apologize, sir!

28
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:49,021
Really, I do! But I am a man of the sea!

29
00:03:49,132 --> 00:03:52,939
And so I assumed that the pool was the
most appropriate place for me to greet...

30
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:57,091
Well, yeah, it wouldn't be a problem if
you could be tiny and adorable all the time,

31
00:03:57,116 --> 00:03:58,554
But whenever you get wet...

32
00:04:01,876 --> 00:04:04,164
You've never seen yourself?!

33
00:04:04,243 --> 00:04:06,648
Ah, just go hide in the machine room!

34
00:04:08,638 --> 00:04:10,424
I'm a disgrace.

35
00:04:11,283 --> 00:04:15,529
I always thought it was my
destiny to live at sea, and now...

36
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,865
Umm...

37
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:33,449
What in Neptune's name is this?

38
00:04:33,474 --> 00:04:37,573
Oh, this is actually a magic portal that
connects Amabri directly to Maple Land.

39
00:04:38,446 --> 00:04:39,998
When the park was first built,

40
00:04:40,023 --> 00:04:43,271
This gate was set up so we
could easily transport supplies.

41
00:04:45,782 --> 00:04:48,537
M-M-Maple Land, that's the m-m-magical k-k-kingdom...

42
00:04:48,562 --> 00:04:51,529
All of you used to I-I-live in, isn't that r-right?

43
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:53,263
Yeah, exactly.

44
00:04:53,506 --> 00:04:55,775
But then we decided to have the portal sealed shut,

45
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,277
Since we don't really have any
use for it anymore, you know?

46
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,606
Oh hey, there's water leaking out.

47
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,816
Well anyway, I'll get the Facilities
guys to come take a look at it.

48
00:05:09,423 --> 00:05:11,353
You two keep an eye on it, okay?

49
00:05:33,229 --> 00:05:35,491
Aye, this be good land.

50
00:05:35,516 --> 00:05:38,627
So me crew 'n' I'll be takin' it fer ourselves!

51
00:05:39,154 --> 00:05:43,162
Now, all ye filthy bilge-rats better
take heed to what we tell ye to do!

52
00:05:43,526 --> 00:05:45,193
And if'n ye won't listen,

53
00:05:45,607 --> 00:05:50,312
you'll answer to ME, the Dread
Lady Pirate, Captain Isuzulha!

54
00:05:51,546 --> 00:05:52,419
What happened?

55
00:05:52,444 --> 00:05:56,388
Waa ah ah ah ah...

56
00:05:56,754 --> 00:05:58,568
Ah, she's moffin' terrible at this.

57
00:05:58,601 --> 00:06:01,662
Avast, ye faithful crew!

58
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,819
Whoever makes a fuss is walkin' the plank!

59
00:06:04,847 --> 00:06:06,535
Aye aye, Captain!

60
00:06:09,799 --> 00:06:12,337
Moff moff moff moff!

61
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:14,543
We won't go easy on you, pirates!

62
00:06:14,568 --> 00:06:15,934
Moff! Moff!

63
00:06:18,224 --> 00:06:21,918
Arrr, ye scallywags! You're gonna swab the poop deck!

64
00:06:23,505 --> 00:06:25,703
Those boys are definitely lovers.

65
00:06:27,729 --> 00:06:29,813
What? You're one of my followers?

66
00:06:29,838 --> 00:06:33,286
I'm a huge fan! I've seen all of your flame wars!

67
00:06:33,835 --> 00:06:35,799
Ye Maaa...

68
00:06:36,417 --> 00:06:38,458
Fen Zongggg...

69
00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:41,196
Sssshhhhhwwww!

70
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:44,697
Oh my, it looks like the performance is already underway!

71
00:06:45,315 --> 00:06:47,893
Yes, I can't wait for the bows.

72
00:06:49,133 --> 00:06:51,237
I shouldn't have made you sneak around with me.

73
00:06:51,395 --> 00:06:52,608
Forgive me, Triken.

74
00:06:53,192 --> 00:06:56,625
Oh, no, I bow down before you, Princess.

75
00:06:57,175 --> 00:06:59,424
But only out of respect, obviously.

76
00:07:02,918 --> 00:07:04,486
Sorry it took so long!

77
00:07:07,173 --> 00:07:08,537
Dad-gum!

78
00:07:08,823 --> 00:07:11,289
It should only take a few minutes, right?

79
00:07:11,314 --> 00:07:12,511
Are you crazy?!

80
00:07:20,192 --> 00:07:21,107
Whoa!

81
00:07:27,596 --> 00:07:28,744
Get 'em, get 'em!

82
00:07:31,061 --> 00:07:32,805
Oh, no that's not good!

83
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:35,173
Moffle and his friends have just been captured!

84
00:07:35,198 --> 00:07:36,710
But all of us can help!

85
00:07:36,798 --> 00:07:38,308
Let's all cheer!

86
00:07:58,608 --> 00:08:01,118
At last, we've found ourselves a port.

87
00:08:02,512 --> 00:08:04,284
Whoa, what's going on over here?!

88
00:08:04,505 --> 00:08:07,001
That big ugly guy's name is Ironbeard.

89
00:08:07,026 --> 00:08:10,803
Back in Maple Land, he's known as
the meanest bully on the high seas.

90
00:08:11,182 --> 00:08:13,150
He must've gotten out through the underground gate.

91
00:08:13,804 --> 00:08:14,751
Probably.

92
00:08:16,113 --> 00:08:19,935
Arr, I was hopin' to find myself
some treasure beyond the portal.

93
00:08:20,536 --> 00:08:26,500
Ah, well, sellin' off the wenches 'n brats oughta
bring in a pretty pile o' gold doubloons at least.

94
00:08:29,673 --> 00:08:32,910
I be the fearsome pirate they call Ironbeard!

95
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:36,772
And I've come here to pillage and pilfer the lot of ye!

96
00:08:36,797 --> 00:08:38,666
So don't bother puttin' up a fight!

97
00:08:41,481 --> 00:08:43,236
What's he doing, Mommy?

98
00:08:43,261 --> 00:08:45,696
Uh-oh, looks like the bad guys are here!

99
00:08:45,849 --> 00:08:47,805
Moff! Moff, moff, moff!

100
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,813
He says "You won't get away with this!"

101
00:08:50,691 --> 00:08:53,505
Ye might as well come along quietly, mateys!

102
00:08:53,569 --> 00:08:55,641
I might even let ye join my crew!

103
00:08:55,942 --> 00:08:57,520
Mii! Mii! Mii!

104
00:08:57,545 --> 00:08:59,781
"No way, we'd never work for you!"

105
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:01,536
A cryin' shame, that.

106
00:09:01,622 --> 00:09:05,162
And I was gonna let ye have
yer fun with any wench ye like.

107
00:09:06,565 --> 00:09:07,704
Resistance be futile!

108
00:09:07,729 --> 00:09:09,541
MOFF! Tiramy!

109
00:09:09,566 --> 00:09:10,494
Traitor-ron!

110
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:12,375
Look, I know what I want, okay?!

111
00:09:12,888 --> 00:09:14,995
Now, me hearties! Grab 'em!

112
00:09:20,716 --> 00:09:22,587
Fire in the hole!

113
00:09:22,612 --> 00:09:24,111
MOFF!

114
00:09:24,136 --> 00:09:24,772
RON!

115
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:25,944
I won't repeat that!

116
00:09:27,337 --> 00:09:28,213
Haa! Yah!

117
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:32,407
Zuo You Lou Xi Ao Bu...

118
00:09:32,628 --> 00:09:35,835
Pr-Princess Latifah, you have to get out of here!

119
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,754
It's too dangerous!

120
00:09:41,071 --> 00:09:42,466
Hyahhhh!

121
00:09:45,405 --> 00:09:47,291
Quit yer wigglin' about!

122
00:10:01,907 --> 00:10:03,166
Sir Kanie!

123
00:10:03,694 --> 00:10:05,519
Um, this isn't good.

124
00:10:07,795 --> 00:10:11,787
Oh, no, Princess Latifah's been kidnapped by the pirates!

125
00:10:19,521 --> 00:10:22,519
Avast! It's time to celebrate!

126
00:10:22,929 --> 00:10:24,712
Miiii!!

127
00:10:26,103 --> 00:10:27,187
This fella says.

128
00:10:27,212 --> 00:10:29,921
"Two more drinks over here,
little lady, and make it snappy!"

129
00:10:29,946 --> 00:10:33,284
Uh, okay! Be right over!

130
00:10:34,723 --> 00:10:35,987
And this gentleman says.

131
00:10:36,012 --> 00:10:39,071
"Hey there, honey, whip us up one
strawberry and one lemon on the double!"

132
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:40,779
Coming up! Hold on a minute!

133
00:10:40,804 --> 00:10:42,246
I thought that was all scripted,

134
00:10:42,271 --> 00:10:44,525
So how is she translating for the seals?

135
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:48,438
In all me years o' debauchery,

136
00:10:48,463 --> 00:10:53,047
I never thought we'd manage to make a
hostage outta the Princess of Maple Land!

137
00:10:55,165 --> 00:10:57,696
Ahoy, what's with all the dillydally?

138
00:10:57,771 --> 00:11:00,294
Fetch me another drink, ye wretched dogs!

139
00:11:01,701 --> 00:11:04,205
Zhuan Shen Ban Ian Chui.

140
00:11:08,407 --> 00:11:10,922
J-Just take the bottle, little Missy!

141
00:11:11,374 --> 00:11:12,131
Right.

142
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:13,357
Here.

143
00:11:21,331 --> 00:11:23,618
They really went all out with whatever this is!

144
00:11:23,643 --> 00:11:25,583
Ron! Now what?!

145
00:11:25,788 --> 00:11:30,179
Our paws are tied. We'll just have to
sit tight and see how everything plays out.

146
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:45,712
I'm alive...

147
00:11:48,299 --> 00:11:49,711
Hey, what's Jaw doing here?

148
00:11:50,785 --> 00:11:51,755
Chujo?!

149
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:54,185
You're eating people now?! You monster!

150
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:55,129
Huh?

151
00:11:56,241 --> 00:11:58,387
N-n-n-no, wait! You've g-g-got it all wrong!

152
00:11:58,595 --> 00:12:01,733
M-M-Mr. Jaw was actually t-t-t-trying to save my I-life,

153
00:12:01,758 --> 00:12:03,693
So that's w-w-why I was-

154
00:12:03,729 --> 00:12:05,687
M-Mr. Jaaaaaaaaah!

155
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:09,764
Acting manager! It's good to see you're okay!

156
00:12:11,371 --> 00:12:12,635
Glad you guys made it!

157
00:12:26,066 --> 00:12:29,247
Well, boys, it seems the time has come!

158
00:12:31,142 --> 00:12:33,018
They're very excited!

159
00:12:37,783 --> 00:12:38,880
PEH!

160
00:12:39,693 --> 00:12:41,886
Ye three louts walk the plank.

161
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:44,188
Bosun, do the honors.

162
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:45,256
Me?

163
00:12:45,596 --> 00:12:46,725
Mii!

164
00:12:47,804 --> 00:12:55,136
"Walk the plank! Walk the plank!"

165
00:13:03,906 --> 00:13:07,396
Ow! Tiramy, how could you do this to me, ron?!

166
00:13:07,421 --> 00:13:09,651
Please don't let it end like this!

167
00:13:10,578 --> 00:13:14,079
Listen! It's okay, mii.

168
00:13:14,469 --> 00:13:18,437
You know I would never push my best
pal into a pool of squishy death, right?

169
00:13:19,664 --> 00:13:21,220
Thanks, Tiramy.

170
00:13:21,446 --> 00:13:25,654
So, you just follow my lead and I promise
I'll get you out of this mess somehow, okay, mii?

171
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:26,981
Okay, got it.

172
00:13:27,219 --> 00:13:28,373
What's the plan now?

173
00:13:28,832 --> 00:13:31,444
Betrayal!

174
00:13:40,045 --> 00:13:42,401
They're saying "Look at him suffer!"

175
00:13:42,499 --> 00:13:44,799
Oh, no! Macaroooon!

176
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:49,584
"Walk the plank! Walk the plank!"

177
00:13:52,989 --> 00:13:56,075
The best way to trick your enemy
is to trick your friends first.

178
00:13:56,142 --> 00:13:58,382
Our comeback starts right now, mii.

179
00:13:58,669 --> 00:14:01,223
Moff, as if I'd fall for that.

180
00:14:03,739 --> 00:14:06,877
Now, just stand right here at the edge of the plank...

181
00:14:10,081 --> 00:14:11,354
Moff!

182
00:14:11,454 --> 00:14:15,386
Mii! Miiiiiiiiii!

183
00:14:20,418 --> 00:14:21,542
MOFF!

184
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,521
<i>That's what I'll do.</i>

185
00:14:25,747 --> 00:14:28,522
Now, just stand at the edge of the plank...

186
00:14:30,132 --> 00:14:31,274
Moff!

187
00:14:33,107 --> 00:14:35,910
Moooofffff!

188
00:14:42,694 --> 00:14:44,394
They love it!

189
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:48,935
Dude, what exactly were you trying to do just now?

190
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:52,523
Okay, your turn! They saved the best for last.

191
00:14:52,633 --> 00:14:55,287
I think I have a plan, if you'll just, um...

192
00:15:00,393 --> 00:15:01,406
M-mii...

193
00:15:39,019 --> 00:15:40,290
Now he's walking?

194
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:41,456
Guess so.

195
00:15:42,626 --> 00:15:43,384
Fire!

196
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:44,529
Hmm?

197
00:15:49,133 --> 00:15:53,820
Yaaaah!

198
00:15:54,876 --> 00:15:56,304
Who's shooting the cannon?!

199
00:15:56,865 --> 00:15:57,654
Kanie?!

200
00:15:58,423 --> 00:16:00,895
On yer feet! Yer comin' with me!

201
00:16:01,652 --> 00:16:02,800
The princess!

202
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,456
Are you okay there, Miss Manager?

203
00:16:11,609 --> 00:16:13,289
I'm all right, thank you.

204
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:14,907
Here we go!

205
00:16:16,187 --> 00:16:18,029
It's time for a little payback!

206
00:16:18,054 --> 00:16:19,587
Ronnn!

207
00:16:19,612 --> 00:16:21,202
Moff!

208
00:16:23,089 --> 00:16:26,166
Look at that, boys and girls,
our friends are here to rescue us!

209
00:16:26,238 --> 00:16:29,193
So, I want you all to cheer nice and loud for them, okay?

210
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:34,597
Uh-oh, whose side should I take now?

211
00:16:34,645 --> 00:16:37,636
Arr, you'll pay for this!

212
00:16:37,771 --> 00:16:38,960
ARRR!

213
00:16:40,887 --> 00:16:41,708
Hyah!

214
00:16:42,331 --> 00:16:44,358
I knew this guy was tough!

215
00:16:46,021 --> 00:16:47,935
Avoid the left side of the stage!

216
00:16:48,002 --> 00:16:49,766
That's where most of the guests are!

217
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:51,821
Third cannon, get it together!

218
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:54,021
Second cannon, reload!

219
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,424
Ah, right away, Captain!

220
00:17:04,207 --> 00:17:06,851
Ready! Fire away!

221
00:17:26,842 --> 00:17:28,321
It's a shark!

222
00:17:28,346 --> 00:17:29,913
St-stay away from me!

223
00:17:29,938 --> 00:17:32,002
Have mercy, I beg ye!

224
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:49,887
Ironbeard and his gang of pirates have surrendered!

225
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:52,330
I really love a happy ending!

226
00:17:53,159 --> 00:17:57,086
Ew, strawberry syrup is so sticky!

227
00:17:58,172 --> 00:18:02,503
Yer a blitherin' fool if ye think ye
can treat the great Ironbeard this way.

228
00:18:02,818 --> 00:18:05,950
Sure I can. You just cost us a fortune in damages.

229
00:18:06,212 --> 00:18:07,954
And I'm gonna make sure you pay.

230
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:09,487
Whatever it takes.

231
00:18:10,164 --> 00:18:12,562
I'd like to see ye try. Yer a...

232
00:18:12,587 --> 00:18:13,955
That's enough out of you!

233
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,836
Unless you want double your punishment!

234
00:18:16,071 --> 00:18:18,376
Ah, beggin' yer pardon, sir.

235
00:18:19,597 --> 00:18:22,048
Today was exciting, huh?

236
00:18:22,073 --> 00:18:23,580
I had a lot of fun!

237
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,936
Can we come back soon, Mommy?

238
00:18:25,961 --> 00:18:27,428
Of course!

239
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:30,987
Fine then, you guys'll work here all summer long.

240
00:18:31,062 --> 00:18:32,614
Without any compensation!

241
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:35,191
And I expect every guest to be entertained.

242
00:18:35,318 --> 00:18:37,285
I'll do no such thing, ye...

243
00:18:37,322 --> 00:18:39,032
Stop your bellyaching.

244
00:18:39,057 --> 00:18:41,101
A-aye, sir.

245
00:18:42,725 --> 00:18:44,800
Jaw... A-at your service!

246
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:47,332
I'd like you to serve as their team leader from now on.

247
00:18:47,357 --> 00:18:48,325
Would you do that for me?

248
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:50,181
Are you sure you want ME, sir?!

249
00:18:50,566 --> 00:18:54,186
Yep! I need you to watch out for them, onstage and off.

250
00:18:56,983 --> 00:18:59,543
Right! I won't let you down!

251
00:18:59,568 --> 00:19:02,657
M-M-Mr. Jaw, c-congratulations!

252
00:19:02,687 --> 00:19:04,472
I'm truly greatful!

253
00:19:04,497 --> 00:19:06,267
Thank you so much! It's an honor!

254
00:19:06,292 --> 00:19:07,399
Sir Kanie...

255
00:19:08,284 --> 00:19:11,697
I just wanted to apologize to you
for all that happened here today.

256
00:19:11,801 --> 00:19:15,549
It's entirely my fault that everything
got out of hand. I'm terribly sorry.

257
00:19:18,886 --> 00:19:20,150
Latifah...

258
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:23,794
What are you talking about?

259
00:19:24,342 --> 00:19:26,047
I should say thank you!

260
00:19:26,675 --> 00:19:28,299
Well, just take a look around!

261
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:31,067
A new side attraction...

262
00:19:31,622 --> 00:19:32,921
New cast members...

263
00:19:33,382 --> 00:19:34,537
A pirate ship!

264
00:19:35,105 --> 00:19:37,100
And we basically got it all for free!

265
00:19:37,942 --> 00:19:39,248
It's kinda funny!

266
00:19:45,754 --> 00:19:46,555
Oh...

267
00:19:50,235 --> 00:19:52,287
All's well that ends well, mii!

268
00:19:52,507 --> 00:19:56,069
You know what? Nobody has anything to be sorry for!

269
00:19:57,455 --> 00:19:59,207
But you do.

270
00:19:59,714 --> 00:20:00,958
Wh-Who, mii?

271
00:20:02,438 --> 00:20:03,463
Lady Isuzu?

272
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:06,058
Please, try not to be too harsh on him.

273
00:20:06,492 --> 00:20:08,091
As you wish, Princess.

274
00:20:09,702 --> 00:20:11,010
You're lucky, Tiramy.

275
00:20:11,394 --> 00:20:13,867
I'll let you say some parting words before you die.

276
00:20:13,924 --> 00:20:16,635
I just wanna say that I have faith in all of you!

277
00:20:17,055 --> 00:20:20,986
I know you guys would never do something
like this to one of your own, right, mii?!

278
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:23,301
Ha! That's a good one, buddy-ron.

279
00:20:23,502 --> 00:20:26,948
Yeah, if that's the case, then it's
a good thing you're not one of us.

280
00:20:27,301 --> 00:20:29,133
Mii!

281
00:20:30,613 --> 00:20:36,343
MMMIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII!!!

282
00:20:52,911 --> 00:20:54,310
Well, well, well!

283
00:20:55,111 --> 00:20:57,667
Never thought you'd end up being acting manager.

284
00:21:00,567 --> 00:21:02,630
Look, is there anything I can do for you?

285
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:04,265
No, not really.

286
00:21:04,411 --> 00:21:06,575
I just wanted to peek in on you for a bit.

287
00:21:06,947 --> 00:21:12,096
From what I understand, your visitor count's been looking
a little more optimistic since the last time I saw you.

288
00:21:12,792 --> 00:21:14,093
I think I get it.

289
00:21:14,478 --> 00:21:17,027
I really don't know that I've done much of anything yet.

290
00:21:18,761 --> 00:21:23,136
Well, then, I suggest you give it
your best shot, Mister Celebrity.

291
00:21:23,277 --> 00:21:24,348
Tick-tock!

292
00:21:52,501 --> 00:21:54,864
All right, let's do one last check!

293
00:21:57,786 --> 00:21:58,593
Front!

294
00:21:59,478 --> 00:22:00,156
Back!

295
00:22:01,485 --> 00:22:02,583
Skirt!

296
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:05,892
Good! It's gonna be perfect!

297
00:23:43,138 --> 00:23:45,476
Time for the attractions spotlight.

298
00:23:46,099 --> 00:23:48,138
Today's feature is Blue Ocean.

299
00:23:48,334 --> 00:23:51,192
It's useful for drawing in customers during the summer.

300
00:23:51,217 --> 00:23:53,023
Better than anything else does, I guess.

301
00:23:53,048 --> 00:23:54,783
But just like what happened today,

302
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:57,441
It does connect to other worlds from time to time.

303
00:23:57,466 --> 00:24:00,804
We've already had to deal with
a kraken and a giant octopus.

304
00:24:00,829 --> 00:24:02,592
And it wasn't all over the news?!

305
00:24:02,617 --> 00:24:05,148
Genjuro, the dolphin, always feels responsible,

306
00:24:05,173 --> 00:24:07,580
So he usually commits ritual suicide.

307
00:24:07,605 --> 00:24:09,325
He usually does?!
