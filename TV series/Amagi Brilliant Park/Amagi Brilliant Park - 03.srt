1
00:00:13,896 --> 00:00:15,607
<i>I look great in anything.</i>

2
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:06,668
Seiya Kanieeee!

3
00:02:08,312 --> 00:02:10,328
You have to stop this now!

4
00:02:10,361 --> 00:02:11,288
Stop what?!

5
00:02:11,313 --> 00:02:12,798
Closing for the day!

6
00:02:12,823 --> 00:02:15,146
And what makes you think I'm taking orders from you?!

7
00:02:15,237 --> 00:02:20,329
In all twenty-nine years of operation, this
park has never once been closed without notice!

8
00:02:20,451 --> 00:02:22,873
The public's come to trust us for that.

9
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:25,360
But now... you...

10
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,453
You're gonna pay for this!

11
00:02:28,478 --> 00:02:29,723
Hyaaah!

12
00:02:30,012 --> 00:02:31,694
<i>Wait, I see a pattern!</i>

13
00:02:31,932 --> 00:02:33,364
You scumbag...

14
00:02:33,415 --> 00:02:35,336
Now it's YOUR turn to pay!

15
00:02:36,905 --> 00:02:38,192
No fighting.

16
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:40,875
How did you fire twice from a muzzleloader?

17
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,748
Try to calm down, Lord Moffle.

18
00:02:42,773 --> 00:02:45,316
How can you tell me to calm down?

19
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:50,068
Thanks to him, we're gonna have to
disappoint all the attendees who show up today!

20
00:02:50,119 --> 00:02:52,930
I refuse to let this guy disrespect our park!

21
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,924
We have to clean up the place.

22
00:02:55,151 --> 00:02:56,534
That's the first step.

23
00:02:56,738 --> 00:03:03,149
Shut your mouth! What does a wise guy like you know
about a park he's only been at for the last two days?!

24
00:03:05,529 --> 00:03:08,086
I hate to admit it, but you bring up a good point.

25
00:03:08,525 --> 00:03:10,773
Maybe you'd better go take care of the guests then.

26
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,844
Moff?!

27
00:03:11,878 --> 00:03:13,313
I don't care how you do it.

28
00:03:13,834 --> 00:03:17,195
Just go entertain the guests in
the square outside the main entrance.

29
00:03:17,606 --> 00:03:21,706
Huh? But what am I gonna do in that big empty space?

30
00:03:21,756 --> 00:03:23,241
What? You can't do it?

31
00:03:23,311 --> 00:03:25,679
Uh! O-Of course I can!

32
00:03:27,343 --> 00:03:28,834
Watch and learn!

33
00:03:30,636 --> 00:03:32,736
<i>This building is kept up pretty well.</i>

34
00:03:33,042 --> 00:03:36,636
<i>It looks like the little rat DOES
take his job seriously after all.</i>

35
00:03:37,055 --> 00:03:40,811
Don't you still have a lot of attractions
you wanted us to inspect today, Kanie?

36
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:41,876
I know.

37
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,173
I see you all made it.

38
00:03:51,777 --> 00:03:54,102
Let's get this administration meeting started.

39
00:03:54,815 --> 00:03:57,286
Keeping it short, we've got three goals.

40
00:03:57,973 --> 00:03:59,070
Number one!

41
00:03:59,414 --> 00:04:01,424
I want the park to stay open later!

42
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:02,391
Boo...

43
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:04,804
Stop complaining like a bunch of kids!

44
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:08,853
Well, I figure that all depends on
how much later we're talkin' about here.

45
00:04:09,017 --> 00:04:12,480
We ain't got the facilities to
keep this place runnin' after dark,

46
00:04:12,505 --> 00:04:15,377
so I reckon after sundown it'll be a no-go.

47
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:17,089
I already thought of that.

48
00:04:17,347 --> 00:04:20,615
First, we'll extend the park hours to 7 pm instead of 5.

49
00:04:20,745 --> 00:04:24,905
In the meantime, we can start setting up whatever
facilities we need so that we can operate at night.

50
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,493
And THEN we'll stretch it to 9 pm when we're ready.

51
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:28,387
How's that?

52
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:31,193
Well, I guess that doesn't sound too bad.

53
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,190
Second! There's no more regular days off!

54
00:04:34,215 --> 00:04:35,155
Boo...

55
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,113
Jeez, you people are such babies!

56
00:04:37,138 --> 00:04:41,507
I mean, seriously, how do you expect your
business to succeed if you're closed on FRIDAYS?!

57
00:04:41,655 --> 00:04:43,644
You never heard of TGIF?

58
00:04:44,703 --> 00:04:48,278
Forget it! That's the best
possible time to rake in the cash!

59
00:04:48,303 --> 00:04:51,223
Listen! From tomorrow morning until July 31st,

60
00:04:51,248 --> 00:04:53,186
not one of you is getting a single day off!

61
00:04:53,211 --> 00:04:54,123
You understand?!

62
00:04:54,304 --> 00:04:55,517
Fine.

63
00:04:55,663 --> 00:04:57,710
I guess we should have seen that coming.

64
00:04:57,806 --> 00:05:00,332
Third! And this is the big one.

65
00:05:01,053 --> 00:05:03,528
I've decided that from now until the end of July,

66
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:07,106
access to the park and all attractions
will be totally free of charge!

67
00:05:07,131 --> 00:05:10,485
HUH?!

68
00:05:11,425 --> 00:05:12,729
You're kidding me!

69
00:05:12,768 --> 00:05:13,427
Nope.

70
00:05:14,827 --> 00:05:18,125
With all due respect, as Chief
of Accounting, I must disagree.

71
00:05:18,535 --> 00:05:23,189
With Amabri consistently in the red, there's
no way we can afford to do something like that.

72
00:05:23,495 --> 00:05:26,730
Can't pay the bills on free admission, boss man.

73
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,219
Besides, we're pros.

74
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:34,054
You can't expect us to entertain
without some kind of paycheck.

75
00:05:34,246 --> 00:05:36,939
Ha, you call punching people entertainment?

76
00:05:37,061 --> 00:05:40,168
Argh! I apologize for what I did, all right?

77
00:05:40,867 --> 00:05:43,847
But regardless of what we're
doing, we can't do it for nothing.

78
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:46,912
If we make everything free, even temporarily,

79
00:05:46,937 --> 00:05:49,690
we'll never get people to pay money for it again.

80
00:05:50,156 --> 00:05:52,856
That'll be the end of Amabri for sure.

81
00:05:53,981 --> 00:05:58,007
Hmm... Well, I knew you guys
wouldn't be too happy with the changes.

82
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:00,401
And your concerns here are pretty valid.

83
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,623
Let me think...

84
00:06:03,414 --> 00:06:06,716
Okay, instead of nothing, we'll
charge 30 yen for everything.

85
00:06:06,903 --> 00:06:07,871
Huh?!

86
00:06:07,905 --> 00:06:09,995
Why 30 of all things?

87
00:06:10,185 --> 00:06:13,560
Because I hear this park's about to
hit its 30th anniversary next year.

88
00:06:14,746 --> 00:06:19,828
I'm sorry, but charging them 30 yen for everything is
essentially the same concept as charging nothing at all.

89
00:06:19,884 --> 00:06:22,490
Look, we need visitors more than cash right now.

90
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:25,681
If we screw up, there won't BE a park to pay bills on.

91
00:06:27,185 --> 00:06:31,323
Now unless you have more questions, I'll adjourn
the meeting so you can get back to your posts.

92
00:06:31,628 --> 00:06:32,604
Carry on!

93
00:06:40,335 --> 00:06:42,670
30 yen is pocket change!

94
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:43,994
You said that already.

95
00:06:44,025 --> 00:06:45,562
Moffin' hard-ass!

96
00:06:45,587 --> 00:06:48,528
That basically tells us our
skills are worth nothing to him!

97
00:06:48,553 --> 00:06:50,109
I won't stand for this!

98
00:06:50,134 --> 00:06:52,062
There's no point in getting angry, Ron.

99
00:06:52,367 --> 00:06:55,016
Come on, Macaron, aren't you mad at all?

100
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:56,793
Think about it this way, Moffle-ron,

101
00:06:56,818 --> 00:06:59,203
if we don't get visitors in the door, we'll be done for,

102
00:06:59,307 --> 00:07:02,249
so we gotta do whatever we can do to survive for a while.

103
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:12,195
You ready to rock the house, Mr. Sweets Fairy-ron?

104
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:15,906
I wouldn't have it any other way, Mr. Music Fairy.

105
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:21,844
Okay, let's put this behind us for a minute

106
00:07:21,869 --> 00:07:24,453
and give those kids a moffin' good show!

107
00:07:27,062 --> 00:07:28,347
Moff!

108
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:31,866
You're stupiiiiiiid!

109
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,412
I wanted to go to Digimarland,

110
00:07:36,437 --> 00:07:38,961
and then we come here and you're not even OPEN?!

111
00:07:39,056 --> 00:07:40,903
Say you're sorry, ya knockoff!

112
00:07:42,173 --> 00:07:44,528
I'm really sorry, little guy.

113
00:07:44,934 --> 00:07:47,632
Stop kicking that thing, Takeshi!

114
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:49,895
Must be his mom.

115
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,753
Good thing she stopped him or I might've killed him.

116
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:56,073
A lot of people put their grubby
hands on these costumes, dear.

117
00:07:56,098 --> 00:07:58,934
Don't touch it or you might get
a disease! Do you understand me?

118
00:07:59,417 --> 00:08:00,779
Yes, ma'am.

119
00:08:01,138 --> 00:08:04,858
If anything happens to my little boy,
your park will be hearing from my lawyer.

120
00:08:04,967 --> 00:08:07,210
You'd better watch yourself, knockoff!

121
00:08:08,116 --> 00:08:09,604
Hashtag brutal!

122
00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:11,636
Please don't start another flame war.

123
00:08:11,661 --> 00:08:15,481
Oh, so you were just worried
about your precious hellspawn.

124
00:08:16,451 --> 00:08:17,705
But...

125
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,601
You picked the wrong mouse!

126
00:08:21,707 --> 00:08:24,872
I don't think so, mister. I'll
make you regret toying with me!

127
00:08:24,986 --> 00:08:26,462
Wait, did you just talk?

128
00:08:26,487 --> 00:08:27,594
Uh-oh, Ron.

129
00:08:28,683 --> 00:08:29,487
Daddy!

130
00:08:29,528 --> 00:08:30,926
Yeah, little man?

131
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:35,648
Would you believe this disgusting
park employee just assaulted me?

132
00:08:35,912 --> 00:08:37,097
Oh, yeah?

133
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,203
Didn't your boss ever tell ya the customer's always right?

134
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:46,162
Lose the stupid costume and I'll
teach you a lesson, ya knockoff!

135
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:48,554
Every customer is a god.

136
00:08:48,784 --> 00:08:49,590
Huh?

137
00:08:50,181 --> 00:08:52,872
But still, whether you're a god or not...

138
00:08:52,897 --> 00:08:54,793
Speak up, I can't hear ya.

139
00:08:54,818 --> 00:08:57,403
There's certain things that shouldn't be said!

140
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:58,897
What's that look for?

141
00:08:59,013 --> 00:09:01,791
Do ya want me to give ya an ass-kickin'? Is that it?

142
00:09:02,267 --> 00:09:04,889
All right... Then say your prayers!

143
00:09:04,913 --> 00:09:06,835
Don't do iiiiit!

144
00:09:14,591 --> 00:09:16,762
Crap! I was too late, Ron!

145
00:09:17,064 --> 00:09:19,752
Hey, Mommy, there's something funny about that mascot.

146
00:09:19,777 --> 00:09:22,304
Shush! What did I tell you about these things?

147
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:24,831
You just take a little nap, okay?

148
00:09:30,143 --> 00:09:32,275
Now it's your turn to learn something.

149
00:09:32,699 --> 00:09:35,874
Get ready to find out what
happens to mouthy humans like you

150
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:38,678
who dare to accuse me of being a knockoff!

151
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:44,947
Thanks for visiting Amagi Brilliant Park!

152
00:09:46,139 --> 00:09:47,746
I don't think so!

153
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:58,472
Forgotten Realm Bullets, they're memory erasers.

154
00:09:58,497 --> 00:09:59,795
I'm sure they'll wake up soon.

155
00:10:00,296 --> 00:10:02,578
Oh God, I just witnessed a crime...

156
00:10:03,599 --> 00:10:05,706
Ah, you get used to it eventually.

157
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:07,138
Yeah, I doubt that!

158
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:11,456
More importantly, why in the hell did you have
to use violence on customers in the first place?!

159
00:10:11,481 --> 00:10:13,566
If the public finds out, we'll be screwed!

160
00:10:13,591 --> 00:10:14,862
What were you thinking?!

161
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:17,792
I know it was a dumb thing to do, all right?

162
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:21,233
Please don't tell me this is
like an everyday thing for you.

163
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:23,806
Not quite.

164
00:10:24,764 --> 00:10:27,262
Yeah, it's more like once every year or so.

165
00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:30,867
I'm surprised the park's made it this far.

166
00:10:31,338 --> 00:10:34,449
Moff... Well, anyway I'm sorry.

167
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:36,962
Go ahead and fire me if you want.

168
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:41,344
<i>He's only saying that because he
knows how much we need him around here.</i>

169
00:10:47,029 --> 00:10:48,156
All right, fine.

170
00:10:48,923 --> 00:10:51,719
I'll let it slide just this once.

171
00:10:52,533 --> 00:10:54,671
But next time, I'll fire you on the spot.

172
00:10:55,725 --> 00:10:56,529
You got that?

173
00:10:59,163 --> 00:11:00,094
Moff!

174
00:11:00,755 --> 00:11:02,262
I thought he was a goner.

175
00:11:02,563 --> 00:11:04,057
He's our top character.

176
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:07,439
Plus, those memory-wiping bullets
of yours came in pretty handy too.

177
00:11:07,464 --> 00:11:09,428
Oh, right, about that...

178
00:11:09,645 --> 00:11:10,669
Yeah, what is it?

179
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:14,940
Well, these Forgotten Realm Bullets
happen to be ridiculously hard to come by.

180
00:11:15,464 --> 00:11:17,787
It takes a whole year just to make one.

181
00:11:18,141 --> 00:11:20,638
They're limited, so we can't afford to waste them.

182
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:24,885
Oh jeez, I had no idea those
things were so valuable. Wait...

183
00:11:25,401 --> 00:11:29,873
What about those super-painful ones you keep on
firing at me and Moffle like it's going outta style?

184
00:11:29,911 --> 00:11:31,429
Those were Pain Bringers.

185
00:11:31,932 --> 00:11:34,008
They cost 30 yen for a 10-pack.

186
00:11:35,024 --> 00:11:35,755
Really?!

187
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:39,611
I'm just saying that certain ammunition
is intended to be used more sparingly.

188
00:11:40,239 --> 00:11:43,890
All right... Anyway, I really
appreciate you saving our butts back there.

189
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:44,995
Oh, no...

190
00:11:45,406 --> 00:11:49,325
Regardless of what happens, I've already
decided to do everything in my power.

191
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:54,495
I see. Then, I may need another body for something soon.

192
00:12:03,205 --> 00:12:06,898
I didn't realize THIS was what he
meant when he said that he needed a body!

193
00:12:11,612 --> 00:12:14,325
Aren't these... a little bit too revealing?

194
00:12:14,907 --> 00:12:18,918
WTF, guys? He actually expects us to walk around in these?

195
00:12:18,943 --> 00:12:20,982
Hashtag pervert, post.

196
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:23,495
Yeah, why couldn't it be hot guys instead?

197
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,684
Vrksasana is the tree pose!

198
00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:28,793
Whoa there, Sylphy! You can't do yoga with your wings on.

199
00:12:30,313 --> 00:12:30,911
Oh!

200
00:12:31,218 --> 00:12:32,784
I didn't know those could come off!

201
00:12:32,809 --> 00:12:34,783
Oh yeah, they're just part of the costume.

202
00:12:34,808 --> 00:12:39,531
They are?! How can a place with actual
magic be so full of cheap gimmicks?

203
00:12:39,716 --> 00:12:44,978
Sir Kanie, are you certain it's all right for
me to be involved with an operation like this?

204
00:12:45,003 --> 00:12:49,119
Sure, I don't mind. Actually, I was really
grateful that you agreed to help me out with it.

205
00:12:49,318 --> 00:12:50,534
Now, get ready!

206
00:12:51,031 --> 00:12:53,396
One, two, three, go!

207
00:12:53,445 --> 00:12:58,818
We're the Amabri girls and we're happy to
say just for 30 yen, you can play all day.

208
00:12:58,843 --> 00:13:00,573
Let me see some more energy!

209
00:13:00,685 --> 00:13:02,218
Ready... go!

210
00:13:02,318 --> 00:13:07,284
We're the Amabri girls and we're happy to
say for just 30 yen, you can play all day!

211
00:13:07,309 --> 00:13:10,262
Latifah, try not to look so stiff.

212
00:13:11,135 --> 00:13:12,651
Even more energy!

213
00:13:12,687 --> 00:13:13,884
Aaand go!

214
00:13:13,948 --> 00:13:19,133
We're the Amabri girls and we're happy to
say, for just 30 yen, you can play all day!

215
00:13:19,223 --> 00:13:21,654
Come on, Sento, you're not even smiling.

216
00:13:22,109 --> 00:13:23,493
One more time!

217
00:13:23,518 --> 00:13:28,663
We're the Amabri girls and we're happy to
say, for just 30 yen, you can play all day!

218
00:13:29,788 --> 00:13:33,346
Oh yes, this will do, this will do just fine!

219
00:13:33,371 --> 00:13:35,778
In fact, I'm hunched over with joy!

220
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:38,626
You don't LOOK hunched over, but great.

221
00:13:38,873 --> 00:13:43,700
You know, I was surprised Mr. Moffle
allowed Princess Latifah to be in the video.

222
00:13:43,838 --> 00:13:45,470
Huh? Wait, what do you mean?

223
00:13:45,735 --> 00:13:47,928
Oh, that's right, perhaps nobody told you.

224
00:13:48,098 --> 00:13:49,719
Mr. Moffle is actually the princess'...

225
00:13:49,744 --> 00:13:51,918
Seiya Kanieeeee!

226
00:13:53,697 --> 00:13:55,651
You have to stop this now!

227
00:13:55,676 --> 00:13:56,586
Now what's wrong?!

228
00:13:56,611 --> 00:13:58,265
That ad is obscene!

229
00:13:58,408 --> 00:14:01,108
I told you, I'm not taking orders from you!

230
00:14:01,133 --> 00:14:03,984
How dare you treat my Latifah like that?!

231
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,618
You little...

232
00:14:05,905 --> 00:14:09,643
I'm gonna make you pay for this!

233
00:14:09,676 --> 00:14:11,084
Hyaaaah!

234
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:12,984
<i>Wait, I see his pattern!</i>

235
00:14:13,781 --> 00:14:14,940
You're mine!

236
00:14:16,611 --> 00:14:17,808
No fighting.

237
00:14:18,652 --> 00:14:19,825
This feels familiar.

238
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:21,793
Try to calm down, Lord Moffle.

239
00:14:22,205 --> 00:14:23,602
Calm down?

240
00:14:24,145 --> 00:14:25,884
Latifah's in bad health.

241
00:14:26,129 --> 00:14:27,727
She was too exposed!

242
00:14:28,152 --> 00:14:29,872
I can't forgive that!

243
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,565
What do you mean bad health?

244
00:14:31,956 --> 00:14:35,118
Besides, I told her she didn't
have to do it if she didn't want to.

245
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:37,471
Latifah's a very sweet girl.

246
00:14:37,496 --> 00:14:40,902
She doesn't know how to say no.
And you took advantage of that!

247
00:14:40,927 --> 00:14:45,186
Relax. Her Highness knew what was
expected of her before she agreed.

248
00:14:45,842 --> 00:14:47,880
Well, even if she did, she...

249
00:14:47,905 --> 00:14:50,004
I've told you this several times.

250
00:14:50,029 --> 00:14:54,082
Making a fuss about things like this will
only make Her Majesty even more miserable.

251
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,718
You've got a point.

252
00:14:58,025 --> 00:15:02,453
But please don't take her out of the rooftop
garden anymore if at all possible, all right?

253
00:15:02,612 --> 00:15:04,332
That's her magic barrier.

254
00:15:04,906 --> 00:15:06,843
Of course, I know that.

255
00:15:07,009 --> 00:15:08,618
Why? What happens?

256
00:15:11,696 --> 00:15:14,226
Why should I even bother explaining that to you?

257
00:15:14,251 --> 00:15:16,425
You'll be gone in three months, right?

258
00:15:18,795 --> 00:15:22,513
The truth is Princess Latifah
suffers from certain complications...

259
00:15:22,538 --> 00:15:26,200
that make it difficult for her to leave
the magic protection of the rooftop garden.

260
00:15:26,501 --> 00:15:29,823
And is it such a big secret that you
can't even tell me what's wrong with her?

261
00:15:30,022 --> 00:15:31,535
No, not exactly.

262
00:15:31,884 --> 00:15:35,338
It's just... it's not the sort of
thing a lot of people should know about.

263
00:15:35,363 --> 00:15:38,555
I don't think it'll get in the way
of your management responsibilities,

264
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:41,192
but I do recommend that you keep it in mind from now on.

265
00:15:46,366 --> 00:15:49,069
What do you propose we do, Acting Manager?

266
00:15:49,297 --> 00:15:50,918
Finish it like we planned.

267
00:15:51,119 --> 00:15:53,386
I've got another video I want you to edit after that,

268
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:55,450
so get this one done as quick as you can.

269
00:15:56,074 --> 00:15:57,166
Understood.

270
00:16:08,026 --> 00:16:11,742
I gotta say, that video's not
getting very many views so far.

271
00:16:11,767 --> 00:16:12,751
Stop looking at it!

272
00:16:12,776 --> 00:16:13,645
Okay!

273
00:16:15,496 --> 00:16:17,067
No surprise there.

274
00:16:17,415 --> 00:16:21,120
Even swimsuits aren't enough to
get the public's attention these days.

275
00:16:27,426 --> 00:16:28,178
Sento...

276
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:29,727
Yes?

277
00:16:30,235 --> 00:16:32,578
Could you tell me the total visitor count for today?

278
00:16:32,933 --> 00:16:36,084
198, no different than normal.

279
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,633
Thank you.

280
00:16:46,008 --> 00:16:48,491
So about the swimsuit video we posted...

281
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:52,107
Well, it appears we've had an
unexpected turn of events overnight.

282
00:16:53,184 --> 00:16:54,102
Oh, I know.

283
00:16:54,276 --> 00:16:55,144
You do?

284
00:16:55,227 --> 00:16:58,104
Good, then maybe we can deal with it quickly.

285
00:16:58,205 --> 00:17:00,177
Moff o' the morning!

286
00:17:01,034 --> 00:17:02,718
Check this out!

287
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:06,862
Yes, I was just about to break the news to Kanie actually.

288
00:17:06,911 --> 00:17:11,255
Aw, man! I'm a star mascot no matter what I'm doing!

289
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:16,020
My charm can even turn the stickiest
of situations into golden opportunities!

290
00:17:16,094 --> 00:17:18,673
I'm so talented, I scare myself.

291
00:17:19,096 --> 00:17:22,272
Say, how many hits does that swimsuit video have now?

292
00:17:22,352 --> 00:17:25,160
Last time I checked, it was over 12,000.

293
00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:28,114
But look at MY video!

294
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:30,824
Ta-da! 200 K!

295
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:33,068
Which means yours is probably just getting attention,

296
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:36,392
because it comes up as related
whenever somebody clicks on mine!

297
00:17:36,417 --> 00:17:39,464
Sure sucks to be you right now, doesn't it?

298
00:17:40,947 --> 00:17:42,305
What's with you?

299
00:17:46,945 --> 00:17:49,126
Wh-what's so moffin' funny?!

300
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:51,432
Did you see who posted the video?

301
00:17:52,459 --> 00:17:54,738
A, Y, I, E, S...

302
00:17:55,553 --> 00:17:56,817
"Ayies"?

303
00:17:57,372 --> 00:17:59,199
What's that s'posed to be?

304
00:17:59,224 --> 00:18:01,018
Try reading it backwards.

305
00:18:01,311 --> 00:18:02,370
Seiya!

306
00:18:02,395 --> 00:18:03,571
You didn't!

307
00:18:03,596 --> 00:18:05,090
Believe it or not, I did.

308
00:18:05,115 --> 00:18:07,424
I was the one who posted that video!

309
00:18:07,508 --> 00:18:08,503
Right, Triken?

310
00:18:08,783 --> 00:18:09,461
Right!

311
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:12,757
You see, Miss Salama captured the footage of the fight

312
00:18:12,782 --> 00:18:15,817
and then the acting manager and
I did the editing and posted it.

313
00:18:15,842 --> 00:18:17,284
So, there you have it.

314
00:18:17,802 --> 00:18:19,497
"Star mascot" huh?

315
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:21,773
If Triken and I hadn't posted that video,

316
00:18:21,798 --> 00:18:25,153
then nobody would've ever found out
that you did anything in the first place!

317
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:26,418
And your charm?

318
00:18:26,804 --> 00:18:28,184
If we hadn't cut it to look like you were the good guy,

319
00:18:28,284 --> 00:18:31,366
the Internet would hate your little rat guts by now!

320
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:37,557
So, it looks like I'M the one who knows how to turn
the stickiest of situations into golden opportunities.

321
00:18:37,582 --> 00:18:39,599
I'm so good I scare myself.

322
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,690
Lord Moffle's video aside,

323
00:18:42,715 --> 00:18:45,781
the fact remains that not many
people have seen the swimsuit ad yet.

324
00:18:46,246 --> 00:18:48,064
Will this really attract more people?

325
00:18:48,821 --> 00:18:51,188
Even if it does, it won't be that many.

326
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:56,971
My statistical knowledge tells me that
fewer than 1% of the people who saw that ad...

327
00:18:57,006 --> 00:18:58,797
will actually decide to come here.

328
00:18:59,379 --> 00:19:02,823
Then why did you make us wear
those embarrassing bathing suits?!

329
00:19:04,147 --> 00:19:06,841
Because if it gets us one more visitor, it's worth it!

330
00:19:06,866 --> 00:19:07,650
Huh?!

331
00:19:09,259 --> 00:19:11,537
I'm ready to do whatever it takes.

332
00:19:18,571 --> 00:19:19,818
I have to go.

333
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,282
The guests are waiting for me.

334
00:19:40,569 --> 00:19:43,770
Oh, good evening, Mr. Acting
Manager. It's nice to see you.

335
00:19:43,795 --> 00:19:45,902
Hey, how's today's visitor count looking?

336
00:19:46,029 --> 00:19:47,835
We managed to get a few more today.

337
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:49,607
223!

338
00:19:49,909 --> 00:19:53,266
That's great! It looks like the
changes are already starting to pay off.

339
00:19:53,536 --> 00:19:55,409
Yeah, and that's not all.

340
00:19:58,758 --> 00:19:59,488
Yeah?

341
00:20:00,112 --> 00:20:03,318
Mr. Moffle seems like he's
extra fired up today or something.

342
00:20:04,577 --> 00:20:06,144
He's doing a great job.

343
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:07,288
Moff!

344
00:20:07,313 --> 00:20:08,795
The kids look really happy.

345
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:13,474
That's our star mascot for you.

346
00:20:19,271 --> 00:20:21,144
I was told this was a party...

347
00:20:21,668 --> 00:20:23,729
for boosting everyone's morale.

348
00:20:24,247 --> 00:20:26,211
So why are there only four of us?

349
00:20:26,306 --> 00:20:28,538
Nobody else wanted to come.

350
00:20:28,658 --> 00:20:31,611
That's because bonding over
booze is something old people do!

351
00:20:31,636 --> 00:20:32,617
Didn't you know that?

352
00:20:33,051 --> 00:20:35,772
Well, anyway, good work today, guys! Moff...

353
00:20:36,412 --> 00:20:37,613
Cheers!

354
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:38,790
Chee...

355
00:20:41,862 --> 00:20:44,793
Maybe you're not so popular after all, Moffle-ron.

356
00:20:45,385 --> 00:20:47,907
Yeah, some Cast Leader you are!

357
00:20:49,074 --> 00:20:51,281
Plus, there's that sister complex, Mii.

358
00:20:51,413 --> 00:20:53,253
What are you talking about?

359
00:20:53,278 --> 00:20:54,717
Everybody knows it.

360
00:20:54,902 --> 00:20:57,569
The only reason you're so
protective of Princess Latifah-ron

361
00:20:57,594 --> 00:21:00,266
is because she's the spitting
image of your sister, and you...

362
00:21:04,019 --> 00:21:07,246
You punks got a problem with me caring about my niece?!

363
00:21:07,271 --> 00:21:08,698
Oh, now you've done it!

364
00:21:09,005 --> 00:21:10,655
You wanna piece of Mii?!

365
00:21:12,392 --> 00:21:14,509
You're goin' down!

366
00:21:14,534 --> 00:21:15,662
Not today!

367
00:21:17,733 --> 00:21:18,484
No fighting.

368
00:21:18,509 --> 00:21:21,416
Jeez, Isuzu, a girl should be more gentle, Mii!

369
00:21:21,834 --> 00:21:24,998
What do I care about how you think girls should behave?

370
00:21:25,506 --> 00:21:28,607
Isuzu, you seem like you're in a bad mood.

371
00:21:28,644 --> 00:21:30,619
This is about Kanie, isn't it?

372
00:21:31,106 --> 00:21:33,679
Why would you be bringing up Kanie all of a sudden?

373
00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:37,484
Well, it's just that I noticed that
every time you were around him today,

374
00:21:37,509 --> 00:21:39,288
you looked a little sad, that's all.

375
00:21:39,351 --> 00:21:41,507
Ooh, that sounds like a scandal, Mii!

376
00:21:41,608 --> 00:21:43,362
That dirty dog, Ron!

377
00:21:43,796 --> 00:21:44,750
That was nothing.

378
00:21:44,775 --> 00:21:49,346
You know, Macaron, I heard she spent the
night over at Kanie's place not too long ago!

379
00:21:49,371 --> 00:21:50,349
Oh, really?

380
00:21:50,374 --> 00:21:51,814
So they're shackin' up?!

381
00:21:55,983 --> 00:21:57,989
What'll we dooooo?!

382
00:21:58,618 --> 00:22:00,211
Princess Latifah, she...

383
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:01,068
Moffu?!

384
00:23:45,636 --> 00:23:47,920
Time for the attractions spotlight.

385
00:23:48,991 --> 00:23:51,739
Today's feature is Tiramy's Flower Adventure.

386
00:23:52,528 --> 00:23:54,991
You mean the super-uncomfortable gondola ride?

387
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:57,693
Apparently, Tiramy offers a backstage tour.

388
00:23:57,961 --> 00:23:59,543
What do you mean "apparently"?

389
00:23:59,829 --> 00:24:01,304
Shouldn't you know that for sure?

390
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:05,796
Rumor has it the tour's only
available to attractive female visitors.

391
00:24:06,223 --> 00:24:07,500
Oh, of course it is!

392
00:24:07,565 --> 00:24:08,714
Shut it down!
