1
00:00:19,257 --> 00:00:21,677
I know it's sudden, Seiya Kanie, but...

2
00:00:22,348 --> 00:00:23,663
Are you free next Sunday?

3
00:00:23,688 --> 00:00:25,964
I want to go to a theme park together with you.

4
00:00:29,337 --> 00:00:31,632
Is this your way of asking me on a date or something?

5
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:32,128
Sure.

6
00:00:32,297 --> 00:00:33,807
And why are you packing heat?

7
00:00:33,832 --> 00:00:35,053
To keep you from running.

8
00:00:35,231 --> 00:00:36,631
You'll shoot if I say no?

9
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,535
Correct. Your answer?

10
00:00:38,655 --> 00:00:40,559
Look, you can't expect me to...

11
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:44,024
Kanie...

12
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:46,423
Answer me.

13
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:29,705
Mm‐hm!

14
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,606
How's it going today, handsome?

15
00:02:33,943 --> 00:02:35,694
Lookin' good as usual.

16
00:02:35,836 --> 00:02:37,505
Since I am a total stud.

17
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,781
And I'm one of the smartest students in the school.

18
00:02:39,806 --> 00:02:44,813
The fact that I was asked out on a date by
some transfer student I've never spoken to before,

19
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:46,344
just doesn't surprise me.

20
00:02:49,089 --> 00:02:49,931
Let's go.

21
00:02:50,616 --> 00:02:52,146
O‐okay...

22
00:02:55,582 --> 00:02:56,697
Isuzu Sento...

23
00:02:56,722 --> 00:02:57,602
That's my name.

24
00:02:57,894 --> 00:02:59,461
Where exactly are we going?

25
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,010
Amabri.

26
00:03:01,357 --> 00:03:02,002
Amabri?

27
00:03:02,271 --> 00:03:04,017
Amagi brilliant park.

28
00:03:04,147 --> 00:03:06,416
There's a bus that goes straight to it from here.

29
00:03:06,537 --> 00:03:07,268
See ya.

30
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,152
Mommy!

31
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:13,031
That pretty lady's got blue stripes on her panties.

32
00:03:13,062 --> 00:03:13,993
Look over there!

33
00:03:14,683 --> 00:03:17,607
Just be like everybody else
and pretend like you don't see it.

34
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,514
So if I don't come with you, I'm dead?

35
00:03:19,539 --> 00:03:20,569
That's the idea.

36
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,015
What's so great about this amusement park anyway?

37
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,378
To put it more clearly, it's a theme park.

38
00:03:25,403 --> 00:03:26,486
What's the difference?

39
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:29,601
And besides, don't you think you
owe me an explanation for all of this?

40
00:03:30,148 --> 00:03:33,018
It hasn't been that long since
you transferred to our school,

41
00:03:33,045 --> 00:03:34,583
and you're trying this hard to get a date?

42
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,018
I mean I know I'm devilishly good‐looking,

43
00:03:37,043 --> 00:03:38,516
but there's gotta be some other reason!

44
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:39,952
What are you trying to accomplish here?

45
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:43,011
Why does it have to be that specific park of all places?

46
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,192
Did you pull that out of your...

47
00:03:49,127 --> 00:03:51,327
Amagi brilliant park, huh?

48
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,690
Have you ever been there before, Kanie?

49
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:56,427
I think I might've been to it
one time when I was really little,

50
00:03:56,452 --> 00:03:57,668
but I'm not sure if I...

51
00:03:59,418 --> 00:04:00,617
Doesn't look that bad.

52
00:04:01,724 --> 00:04:03,725
Next stop, Amagi Brilliant Park.

53
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,844
I repeat, Amagi Brilliant Park.

54
00:04:05,869 --> 00:04:06,447
Wait.

55
00:04:06,472 --> 00:04:07,597
Please take all your belongings...

56
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:08,743
it's the next one.

57
00:04:08,944 --> 00:04:10,795
Then what's that big, fancy castle thing?

58
00:04:10,929 --> 00:04:12,148
A love hotel.

59
00:04:12,305 --> 00:04:13,723
Oh... what?!

60
00:04:13,803 --> 00:04:14,631
A love hotel.

61
00:04:14,714 --> 00:04:15,826
Yeah, I get it!

62
00:04:15,851 --> 00:04:17,200
It's a common mistake.

63
00:04:17,343 --> 00:04:19,986
The main park entrance used to be at that stop,

64
00:04:20,097 --> 00:04:22,544
until the park was renovated ten years ago.

65
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,542
The love hotel was built on that land shortly after that.

66
00:04:27,677 --> 00:04:28,722
That's misleading!

67
00:04:28,939 --> 00:04:31,386
Why don't they just change the name of the bus stop then?

68
00:04:31,599 --> 00:04:33,472
That request was made a while ago,

69
00:04:33,514 --> 00:04:35,991
but it keeps getting put off for some reason.

70
00:04:36,232 --> 00:04:39,240
Despite how many guests get off the bus back there.

71
00:04:39,301 --> 00:04:40,322
Wait, "guests"?

72
00:04:40,371 --> 00:04:41,787
You know, customers.

73
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:43,799
That's what they're called at most theme parks.

74
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:47,531
The customers are guests, and
the staff are called cast members.

75
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:48,742
Try to remember that.

76
00:04:48,842 --> 00:04:50,305
Isuzu Sento,

77
00:04:50,535 --> 00:04:52,791
you're kind of a strange girl, you know that?

78
00:05:11,546 --> 00:05:12,983
Here we are, Kanie.

79
00:05:20,315 --> 00:05:22,018
It's this dead on a Sunday?

80
00:05:22,134 --> 00:05:26,093
Typical count on weekend days is 2,110.

81
00:05:26,381 --> 00:05:27,669
That's precise.

82
00:05:28,131 --> 00:05:30,362
Let's go to sorcerer's hill first.

83
00:05:30,445 --> 00:05:31,701
"Sorcerer's hill"?

84
00:05:31,997 --> 00:05:34,000
It's one of the areas of Amabri.

85
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:38,726
Since it's home to the lovable mascot
characters of the magical kingdom of maple land,

86
00:05:38,751 --> 00:05:40,586
it's bursting with dreams and happiness.

87
00:05:40,615 --> 00:05:43,703
The way you said that just now makes
me think it's bursting with boredom.

88
00:05:45,197 --> 00:05:47,301
This is Tiramy's flower adventure.

89
00:05:47,562 --> 00:05:49,167
Tiramy's a flower fairy.

90
00:05:50,027 --> 00:05:52,596
I'd like to recommend climbing aboard the fancy train.

91
00:05:52,621 --> 00:05:55,787
It'll whisk you away to a delightful
world full of love and cheer.

92
00:05:55,812 --> 00:05:57,190
Like I told you the first time,

93
00:05:57,222 --> 00:05:59,464
you're not making it sound very delightful at all.

94
00:05:59,698 --> 00:06:01,316
Welcome...

95
00:06:01,341 --> 00:06:02,405
Two, please.

96
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,261
Sure.

97
00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:12,515
Seems the rails are misaligned.

98
00:06:12,562 --> 00:06:13,476
That's dangerous!

99
00:06:13,548 --> 00:06:14,364
I quite agree.

100
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:18,169
Weeelcome to Tiiiiramy's floooweerrrr adventuuuure!

101
00:06:18,194 --> 00:06:24,337
Weeelcome to Tiiiiramy's floooweerrrr adventuuuure!

102
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,209
What the...

103
00:06:25,275 --> 00:06:27,464
This is the part where Tiramy's supposed to come out

104
00:06:27,489 --> 00:06:28,764
and wave at everyone.

105
00:06:28,795 --> 00:06:30,271
But he's missing again.

106
00:06:30,425 --> 00:06:32,288
Again? Wait a minute,

107
00:06:32,313 --> 00:06:34,222
how many times have you been to this place?

108
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:37,726
So, how was that?

109
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,216
Oh, god...

110
00:06:40,841 --> 00:06:43,146
Next we have Macaron's music theater.

111
00:06:43,219 --> 00:06:44,573
He's a music fairy.

112
00:06:45,275 --> 00:06:48,997
Macaron's performances feature
sweet melodies and uplifting rhythms.

113
00:06:49,022 --> 00:06:51,304
It's guaranteed to make your heart sing with delight.

114
00:06:51,335 --> 00:06:52,986
We need to have a talk about this.

115
00:06:53,905 --> 00:06:55,734
He only works when he feels like it.

116
00:06:55,822 --> 00:06:57,296
That's an artist for you.

117
00:06:57,321 --> 00:06:58,420
Seriously?!

118
00:06:59,837 --> 00:07:01,820
This is Moffle's sweets house.

119
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:05,697
Moffle is a sweets fairy as
well as the most popular mascot.

120
00:07:06,395 --> 00:07:08,083
Just one bite of these treats,

121
00:07:08,108 --> 00:07:09,814
and you'll be floating through a world of bliss.

122
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:10,743
Oh, come on!

123
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:13,306
Welcome to Moffle's sweets house!

124
00:07:13,331 --> 00:07:16,551
Uh‐oh, the shop is full of mischievous mice!

125
00:07:16,576 --> 00:07:19,315
Use the magic water guns to teach them a lesson!

126
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,024
So it's some kind of shooting game?

127
00:07:21,219 --> 00:07:23,300
All I have to do is shoot the mice with this gun?

128
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:24,166
Correct.

129
00:07:24,624 --> 00:07:26,314
I'm a pro at these kinds of games.

130
00:07:26,438 --> 00:07:29,042
Get ready to marvel at the work of a true master.

131
00:07:29,067 --> 00:07:30,515
Let the slaughter begin!

132
00:07:30,603 --> 00:07:31,822
Did she say "slaughter"?!

133
00:07:41,392 --> 00:07:42,120
They're fast!

134
00:07:45,091 --> 00:07:45,883
I got one!

135
00:07:45,908 --> 00:07:47,209
We're headed for the pantry.

136
00:07:47,297 --> 00:07:48,431
Don't let your guard down.

137
00:07:50,936 --> 00:07:52,773
This game is freaking impossible!

138
00:07:52,798 --> 00:07:54,044
Just try harder.

139
00:07:55,687 --> 00:07:58,661
Okay, that was... way too hard...

140
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:01,246
Aww, darn! You didn't kill very many!

141
00:08:01,271 --> 00:08:02,765
Wait! I was killing them?!

142
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,567
But you said I was just teaching them a lesson!

143
00:08:04,592 --> 00:08:06,710
Right, the more mice you kill,

144
00:08:06,735 --> 00:08:09,225
the bigger the reward you can get for their corpses.

145
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,970
Do you even realize how violent you sound right now?

146
00:08:12,105 --> 00:08:16,230
Family‐friendly places like this aren't
supposed to use words like "kill" or "corpses."

147
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,914
But Moffle appreciates all your help!

148
00:08:19,002 --> 00:08:22,121
Be sure to take a photo with
him in the next room before you go!

149
00:08:22,219 --> 00:08:25,047
This is the room where you get
your picture taken with Moffle.

150
00:08:25,135 --> 00:08:28,709
I don't really care to take pictures
with a guy in a rat suit or whatever.

151
00:08:28,813 --> 00:08:31,726
Just say hello. It'll be fun, I promise.

152
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:35,108
Are you telling me there are people
who find this crazy death game fun?

153
00:08:35,196 --> 00:08:36,202
Of course.

154
00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:40,128
Those are photos of all the guests
who have gotten high scores in the past.

155
00:08:40,428 --> 00:08:42,902
Looks like it appeals to a specific kind of person.

156
00:08:48,933 --> 00:08:49,953
Moff!

157
00:08:56,455 --> 00:08:58,081
Moffle, the sweets fairy.

158
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:00,417
He's the most popular mascot here.

159
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:01,690
Huh...

160
00:09:04,512 --> 00:09:05,471
Something wrong?

161
00:09:05,929 --> 00:09:06,689
No...

162
00:09:07,132 --> 00:09:09,099
He just irks me for some reason.

163
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,807
We'd like to take a photo with you, all right?

164
00:09:11,888 --> 00:09:12,554
Moff.

165
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,005
Wait, what's the point if you're not in it?!

166
00:09:17,138 --> 00:09:19,011
Why are you copping an attitude?!

167
00:09:19,036 --> 00:09:20,452
I'm a customer, buddy!

168
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:22,291
Try to calm down, Kanie.

169
00:09:22,316 --> 00:09:23,050
Right...

170
00:09:23,336 --> 00:09:25,036
Don't worry, I can be calm.

171
00:09:25,228 --> 00:09:26,887
I promise I won't lose my cool.

172
00:09:28,804 --> 00:09:33,019
Whatever, I'm out. I'm not gonna sit here
and take this crap from a knockoff like...

173
00:09:34,328 --> 00:09:37,526
There's nothing Moffle despises
more than being called a knockoff.

174
00:09:37,766 --> 00:09:40,202
So that makes it okay to throw
a camera at a customer's head?!

175
00:09:40,418 --> 00:09:42,683
Why's he standing there like he's ready to punch me out?!

176
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:43,523
Wahhhhahah!

177
00:09:46,793 --> 00:09:48,423
All right, that's it.

178
00:09:48,908 --> 00:09:50,045
Now I'm angry!

179
00:09:51,617 --> 00:09:52,518
That's better.

180
00:09:53,216 --> 00:09:55,031
<i>That crazy woman just shot me!</i>

181
00:09:55,231 --> 00:09:56,864
<i>She actually shot me!</i>

182
00:09:57,331 --> 00:10:01,461
<i>Am I really gonna die because of
some stupid guy in a mascot suit?!</i>

183
00:10:02,213 --> 00:10:02,944
I lived...

184
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:05,635
You two were about to engage in a fight to the death.

185
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:09,292
And I won't allow you to sully the
sweets house of happiness with your blood.

186
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,962
I don't see any happiness in here!

187
00:10:10,987 --> 00:10:14,199
And besides, you've got no right
to talk, little miss sharpshooter!

188
00:10:14,224 --> 00:10:15,722
Right. Well, Kanie,

189
00:10:15,747 --> 00:10:18,980
did you have a good time bonding with
Moffle through friendly competition?

190
00:10:19,005 --> 00:10:20,405
Is that what you're calling it?!

191
00:10:20,433 --> 00:10:21,356
You'll get along, right?

192
00:10:21,381 --> 00:10:22,083
No way!

193
00:10:22,108 --> 00:10:24,067
Took the words right out of my mouth.

194
00:10:24,092 --> 00:10:25,701
Wait a second, he talks too?

195
00:10:25,726 --> 00:10:27,099
Well, that's enough for now.

196
00:10:27,124 --> 00:10:29,900
We got our souvenir photo, so let's get moving.

197
00:10:30,227 --> 00:10:31,250
We got what?

198
00:10:33,313 --> 00:10:35,315
That sucked! He's a total jerk!

199
00:10:35,608 --> 00:10:36,615
You really think so?

200
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:40,085
Why does this park need an angry
mouse character wearing a goofy hat?

201
00:10:40,236 --> 00:10:43,580
Seriously, the guy inside the suit
must have some kind of attitude problem.

202
00:10:43,605 --> 00:10:45,113
There's nobody inside the suit.

203
00:10:45,284 --> 00:10:45,840
'Scuse me?

204
00:10:46,029 --> 00:10:47,134
It's only Moffle.

205
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:49,236
There's nobody inside the suit.

206
00:10:49,284 --> 00:10:51,389
Oh, right, I get it now.

207
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,068
You're supposed to tell everybody

208
00:10:53,093 --> 00:10:55,791
it's a real magical mouse
thing instead of a guy in a suit,

209
00:10:55,816 --> 00:10:58,313
so the kids don't stop believing
in Santa Claus or whatever.

210
00:10:58,338 --> 00:10:59,310
Is that what's going on?

211
00:10:59,335 --> 00:11:01,968
No, I'm saying there's no one inside the suit.

212
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:04,960
Moffle is a real resident of the magical kingdom.

213
00:11:04,985 --> 00:11:06,285
"Magical kingdom"?

214
00:11:06,837 --> 00:11:09,909
All right, you win, if it means that much to you.

215
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,829
This is the elementario theater.

216
00:11:13,127 --> 00:11:19,655
Here, the four elemental spirits perform beautifully
choreographed dance numbers and unbelievable wire stunts.

217
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:22,535
My name is muse, the water spirit!

218
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:27,660
We hope you enjoy the elementario spectacular!

219
00:11:27,685 --> 00:11:29,104
You can call me sylphy.

220
00:11:29,129 --> 00:11:32,007
I'm the spirit of wind. You wanna be friends?

221
00:11:32,048 --> 00:11:34,498
I'm the earth spirit known as kobory.

222
00:11:34,838 --> 00:11:37,130
Uhmm... it's lovely to meet you.

223
00:11:37,247 --> 00:11:38,937
What's up? I'm salama.

224
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:40,739
I'm the fire spirit.

225
00:11:40,803 --> 00:11:43,181
All right, having fun?!

226
00:11:45,817 --> 00:11:48,080
Wow, it sure sounds like you are!

227
00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:49,926
Let's get this show on the road!

228
00:11:49,956 --> 00:11:50,892
This is sad.

229
00:11:50,917 --> 00:11:52,299
That's about how it always is.

230
00:11:52,353 --> 00:11:53,836
Let's continue the tour.

231
00:11:55,123 --> 00:11:56,514
The thrill coaster...

232
00:11:56,667 --> 00:12:00,368
A heart‐pounding adventure aboard
a speeding train of fun and thrills.

233
00:12:00,731 --> 00:12:01,619
Are you scared?

234
00:12:01,859 --> 00:12:03,271
You've gotta be joking.

235
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,180
Good, let's take a ride.

236
00:12:16,855 --> 00:12:18,143
Were you terrified?

237
00:12:18,168 --> 00:12:18,922
Not really.

238
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:20,733
Oh, well, let's keep moving.

239
00:12:22,213 --> 00:12:23,523
Brilliant market...

240
00:12:23,917 --> 00:12:26,187
Check out Amabri's hottest merchandise.

241
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:27,911
This place looks really outdated.

242
00:12:29,641 --> 00:12:30,720
Kiddie play...

243
00:12:30,822 --> 00:12:33,939
A spacious play area glowing with the smiles of children.

244
00:12:33,964 --> 00:12:34,919
Obviously.

245
00:12:36,518 --> 00:12:37,588
Free fall...

246
00:12:37,635 --> 00:12:40,891
They slowed it down so it wouldn't
scare the little kids too much.

247
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:42,208
So it's an elevator.

248
00:12:43,424 --> 00:12:44,493
The coffee cups...

249
00:12:44,518 --> 00:12:46,720
They're famous for their extreme speed.

250
00:12:47,075 --> 00:12:48,481
I think I'm gonna puke...

251
00:12:48,989 --> 00:12:50,004
I hate this!

252
00:12:50,029 --> 00:12:51,366
Seems like you're upset.

253
00:12:51,391 --> 00:12:52,285
Why wouldn't I be?

254
00:12:52,417 --> 00:12:55,326
Every single attraction in
this park is a lame piece of crap!

255
00:12:55,595 --> 00:12:57,754
Nothing works right, the service is terrible...

256
00:12:57,785 --> 00:12:59,811
At least the love hotel looks nice!

257
00:12:59,836 --> 00:13:04,152
And the worst part of it is the people running this
place don't know the first thing about entertainment!

258
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:07,352
Do they really think kids are
fooled by stupid gags like this?

259
00:13:08,091 --> 00:13:10,561
Kids are a lot harder to trick than you might think!

260
00:13:10,907 --> 00:13:13,142
It's not something you can just pull out of your ass!

261
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,029
You have to work hard and commit to it!

262
00:13:15,404 --> 00:13:17,862
But no, this place doesn't even come close to that!

263
00:13:18,413 --> 00:13:20,230
If they want to make dreams come true,

264
00:13:20,347 --> 00:13:23,660
the people who work here have to
believe in their own dreams first!

265
00:13:23,685 --> 00:13:24,315
I mean...

266
00:13:34,293 --> 00:13:36,403
If you want to make dreams come true,

267
00:13:36,428 --> 00:13:39,254
then the first thing you have to
do is believe in dreams yourself.

268
00:13:39,466 --> 00:13:41,690
You said it harshly, but you're right.

269
00:13:42,308 --> 00:13:46,311
But that doesn't sound like something your
normal everyday high school student would say.

270
00:13:46,513 --> 00:13:49,141
Just forget it. I copied it from a book.

271
00:13:49,486 --> 00:13:50,359
You know, at first,

272
00:13:50,384 --> 00:13:53,482
I assumed that the reason you were
acting so irritated was because...

273
00:13:53,507 --> 00:13:57,575
a strange girl forced you to come to a
theme park and wander around with her all day.

274
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:01,271
So you do know you're being a
huge inconvenience to me then.

275
00:14:01,296 --> 00:14:05,204
But you're obviously frustrated because
of another issue entirely, aren't you?

276
00:14:05,329 --> 00:14:07,472
It's like you're angry at the park itself.

277
00:14:11,837 --> 00:14:16,649
Seiya Kanie... amagi high school class 2‐4, age 16.

278
00:14:16,704 --> 00:14:18,639
Currently resides with his aunt.

279
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,627
How did you know that?

280
00:14:19,751 --> 00:14:23,109
Attractive, intelligent, superior athletic skills.

281
00:14:23,134 --> 00:14:24,667
True, but what's your point?

282
00:14:24,774 --> 00:14:30,902
A man of many talents can succeed at
almost anything, but notoriously narcissistic.

283
00:14:30,932 --> 00:14:33,698
Loves himself so much it's disgusting.

284
00:14:33,723 --> 00:14:35,692
That's why you don't have friends or a girlfriend.

285
00:14:35,717 --> 00:14:36,664
Hey, wait!

286
00:14:36,689 --> 00:14:39,778
You always eat your lunch by
yourself because no one likes you.

287
00:14:41,677 --> 00:14:44,045
Where did you get all this info about my life?

288
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:45,910
I've been doing extensive research.

289
00:14:45,935 --> 00:14:48,477
Okay, but why did you do all that research?!

290
00:14:48,591 --> 00:14:49,932
Seiya Kodama...

291
00:14:52,522 --> 00:14:53,697
From what I've heard,

292
00:14:53,722 --> 00:14:56,651
there was a successful child
actor by that name a few years ago.

293
00:14:57,017 --> 00:14:59,435
Any adult would've called him the perfect child.

294
00:14:59,737 --> 00:15:03,853
But for whatever reason, Seiya
Kodama suddenly retired five years ago.

295
00:15:05,523 --> 00:15:07,610
He should be in high school by now, right?

296
00:15:08,025 --> 00:15:10,618
What do you think he would say if he saw this place?

297
00:15:13,735 --> 00:15:18,677
Now I get it... you made me come here,
because you knew about that from the start.

298
00:15:18,965 --> 00:15:20,033
That's correct.

299
00:15:20,209 --> 00:15:22,558
Look, I don't know what it is you're trying to pull here,

300
00:15:22,723 --> 00:15:25,687
but Seiya Kodama's been dead for a long time, all right?

301
00:15:25,775 --> 00:15:26,893
He disappeared.

302
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:29,517
So if you think you can use him to your advantage somehow,

303
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:31,537
then you're wasting your time.

304
00:15:32,117 --> 00:15:35,897
That's it. Try to shoot me if
you want, but I'm outta here.

305
00:15:35,946 --> 00:15:36,726
Wait!

306
00:15:37,777 --> 00:15:39,744
You have to eat these before you go.

307
00:15:39,769 --> 00:15:40,937
They'll be cold soon.

308
00:15:41,229 --> 00:15:42,765
I don't care about your croquettes.

309
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,190
Just eat them, please.

310
00:15:53,323 --> 00:15:55,834
<i>The crust isn't very thick, but the crunch is exquisite.</i>

311
00:15:56,019 --> 00:15:57,831
<i>The inside is juicy and warm.</i>

312
00:15:58,036 --> 00:16:01,517
<i>Plus, the minced meat and mashed
potatoes make a perfect combo of flavors!</i>

313
00:16:05,355 --> 00:16:06,234
Do you like them?

314
00:16:07,736 --> 00:16:08,271
Yeah...

315
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:10,414
Those are exclusive to this park.

316
00:16:10,515 --> 00:16:12,279
You can't get them anywhere else.

317
00:16:12,479 --> 00:16:14,100
Wow, did you make these?

318
00:16:14,134 --> 00:16:14,940
I didn't.

319
00:16:15,219 --> 00:16:17,103
But would you like to meet the one who did?

320
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,281
How are you affiliated with this park?

321
00:16:29,844 --> 00:16:31,103
Did I say I was?

322
00:16:31,214 --> 00:16:32,944
No, I just kinda figured it out.

323
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:38,578
Where are we going?

324
00:16:38,735 --> 00:16:40,098
To the roof of maple castle.

325
00:16:40,446 --> 00:16:42,682
You said you wanted to meet the park manager.

326
00:16:42,843 --> 00:16:43,745
I did?

327
00:16:57,754 --> 00:16:58,682
Kanie?

328
00:16:59,016 --> 00:16:59,916
Something wrong?

329
00:16:59,949 --> 00:17:01,746
Uh, no, I'm okay.

330
00:17:01,843 --> 00:17:02,560
Good...

331
00:17:02,816 --> 00:17:05,288
Then you should go say hello to her highness.

332
00:17:05,313 --> 00:17:05,815
Huh?

333
00:17:05,981 --> 00:17:06,602
Go on.

334
00:17:17,153 --> 00:17:19,665
Hello, you must be sir Seiya Kanie.

335
00:17:19,814 --> 00:17:21,606
Uh, that's me.

336
00:17:21,912 --> 00:17:24,700
I'm pleased to meet you. My name is latifah Fullanza.

337
00:17:24,725 --> 00:17:27,404
And I happen to be the manager of this park.

338
00:17:27,522 --> 00:17:28,526
Manager?

339
00:17:28,774 --> 00:17:33,809
Yes, I do so appreciate you taking the
time to come and visit our grounds today.

340
00:17:34,187 --> 00:17:36,001
Uh, sure.

341
00:17:38,496 --> 00:17:40,644
So you're the one who made those croquettes?

342
00:17:40,716 --> 00:17:42,974
Oh, yes, I make them every day.

343
00:17:43,213 --> 00:17:46,954
I like to do what I can to help
our guests enjoy themselves here.

344
00:17:47,402 --> 00:17:51,398
Um, don't take this the wrong
way, but what is it you want?

345
00:17:51,768 --> 00:17:53,200
And who exactly are you?

346
00:17:55,163 --> 00:17:57,116
The park is quite expansive.

347
00:17:57,331 --> 00:17:59,040
Have you already seen all of it?

348
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:02,219
Uh‐huh, more than I wanted to.

349
00:18:02,497 --> 00:18:03,552
What did you think?

350
00:18:05,165 --> 00:18:07,245
Well, where do I start?

351
00:18:10,899 --> 00:18:14,462
Say no more, I'm certain it was far from ideal.

352
00:18:16,633 --> 00:18:17,803
Sir Kanie...

353
00:18:18,605 --> 00:18:20,385
Please grant me this one favor.

354
00:18:20,655 --> 00:18:26,569
Our precious park is in danger of closing down, and
I was hoping that you could be the one to rescue it.

355
00:18:26,649 --> 00:18:27,513
What?

356
00:18:27,617 --> 00:18:29,951
Amagi brilliant park needs your leadership.

357
00:18:30,113 --> 00:18:31,977
Please say you'll be the manager for us!

358
00:18:32,095 --> 00:18:34,532
You mean you want me to be in charge of this place?

359
00:18:35,058 --> 00:18:36,059
Yes...

360
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:40,058
You have what it takes to save this park from ruin.

361
00:18:40,129 --> 00:18:43,290
That is what the oracle has made clear to us.

362
00:18:43,442 --> 00:18:44,335
"Oracle"?

363
00:18:44,448 --> 00:18:45,419
That's right.

364
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,011
We are residents of maple land, a kingdom of magic.

365
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:51,886
Are you serious?

366
00:18:52,734 --> 00:18:56,808
Yes. You see, the kingdom where I was
born is different from the world you live in,

367
00:18:56,928 --> 00:18:59,773
because magical happenings tend to be commonplace.

368
00:19:00,078 --> 00:19:02,326
To tell you the truth, most of the cast members

369
00:19:02,351 --> 00:19:04,360
who live and work here at amagi brilliant park

370
00:19:04,385 --> 00:19:07,424
are actually native to that magical land the same as I am.

371
00:19:08,828 --> 00:19:09,532
Huh?

372
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:14,143
However, if we don't succeed
in welcoming 250,000 visitors,

373
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:16,763
then the park will close in three months.

374
00:19:17,145 --> 00:19:21,176
If that happens, the people of maple
land will have nowhere left to go,

375
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:23,546
which means we will cease to exist forever.

376
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:28,045
Wait a second, you can't just expect me
to believe all this magic stuff is real.

377
00:19:29,942 --> 00:19:31,822
I understand this is difficult.

378
00:19:32,114 --> 00:19:33,231
That's why I...

379
00:19:40,324 --> 00:19:44,302
That's why I'm going to demonstrate a
bit of magic for you right now, all right?

380
00:19:44,327 --> 00:19:44,888
Magic?

381
00:19:44,918 --> 00:19:45,831
Indeed.

382
00:19:54,562 --> 00:19:55,870
Now, Sir Kanie,

383
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:58,853
I need you to stay still please.

384
00:20:12,335 --> 00:20:13,995
Oh no, Sir Kanie!

385
00:20:14,078 --> 00:20:15,108
Are you hurt?!

386
00:20:15,133 --> 00:20:17,066
Please help me, lady Isuzu!

387
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:18,917
We must move him inside at once!

388
00:20:19,171 --> 00:20:21,039
Sir Kanie, wake up!

389
00:20:29,939 --> 00:20:32,644
Oh, I'm in my room?

390
00:20:38,088 --> 00:20:39,131
Better wash up.

391
00:20:56,624 --> 00:20:58,518
Hey, aunt Aisu! I know you're in there!

392
00:20:58,543 --> 00:21:02,002
Open up, I need to talk to
you! Aunt Aisu! Come out, hurry!

393
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,607
What in the world do you want at this hour?

394
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:08,748
Aunt Aisu, why is that girl here?!

395
00:21:08,773 --> 00:21:10,258
Oh, you mean Isuzu?

396
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,836
She brought you home last night after
the last train was gone so I let her stay.

397
00:21:14,861 --> 00:21:17,399
I think she told me you tripped and knocked yourself out.

398
00:21:17,816 --> 00:21:20,117
<i>Can't believe Seiya had a date with a girl.</i>

399
00:21:20,142 --> 00:21:21,919
<i>He's really changed his ways.</i>

400
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:26,504
<i>Not that long ago, he thought of
every girl he met as his nemesis.</i>

401
00:21:26,553 --> 00:21:29,568
<i>Well, as his guardian, I have to say I'm pleased.</i>

402
00:21:30,129 --> 00:21:31,406
That was really weird.

403
00:21:31,407 --> 00:21:31,901
Huh?

404
00:21:32,233 --> 00:21:33,684
Did you say something just now?

405
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:35,957
Something about me changing my ways?

406
00:21:36,746 --> 00:21:37,727
What?! Nothing!

407
00:21:37,752 --> 00:21:39,182
Wh‐what are you talking about?!

408
00:21:39,207 --> 00:21:41,741
It looked like you had your mouth
closed, but I know I heard your voice.

409
00:21:41,766 --> 00:21:43,152
Oh, that's right!

410
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:45,012
I must be really hungover right now!

411
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:47,180
I should probably go back to sleep for a while.

412
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:49,551
And you'd better be getting
ready for school, don't you think?

413
00:21:49,836 --> 00:21:50,554
See ya!

414
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,322
Kanie!

415
00:21:53,431 --> 00:21:56,375
It would appear that you've
just awakened to a magic ability.

416
00:21:56,599 --> 00:21:57,454
Huh?!

417
00:22:01,432 --> 00:22:03,816
I assume you believe what I told you now?

418
00:23:44,129 --> 00:23:46,833
Time for the attractions spotlight.

419
00:23:47,226 --> 00:23:51,720
This segment will showcase all the
exciting attractions Amabri has to offer.

420
00:23:51,745 --> 00:23:52,673
You don't sound excited.

421
00:23:52,698 --> 00:23:55,182
Our first feature is Moffle's sweets house.

422
00:23:55,426 --> 00:23:57,583
The difficulty is actually adjustable.

423
00:23:57,608 --> 00:23:58,508
It is?

424
00:23:58,533 --> 00:23:59,920
Easy, normal, hard,

425
00:23:59,945 --> 00:24:02,155
and for the toughest challengers, insane.

426
00:24:02,337 --> 00:24:05,329
Insane is so brutal that some guests lose their senses.

427
00:24:05,354 --> 00:24:06,448
I wouldn't advertise that.

428
00:24:06,484 --> 00:24:09,105
Oh, and Kanie, you played on easy this time.

429
00:24:09,348 --> 00:24:10,198
Easy?!
