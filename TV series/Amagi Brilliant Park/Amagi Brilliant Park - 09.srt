1
00:00:02,611 --> 00:00:05,616
And so peace was restored to the enchanted forest.

2
00:00:05,641 --> 00:00:11,267
And the miracle brought about by the four
spirits became known as the Legend of Elementario!

3
00:00:14,731 --> 00:00:15,976
Ah, jeez...

4
00:00:16,015 --> 00:00:17,180
Wh-whoaaa!

5
00:00:20,584 --> 00:00:21,887
Thank you everyone!

6
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:23,469
See you soon!

7
00:00:23,494 --> 00:00:25,746
W-we hope you liked the performance...

8
00:00:25,771 --> 00:00:27,125
Yeah! Whatever.

9
00:00:27,238 --> 00:00:30,374
Dhanyavadah te!

10
00:00:30,414 --> 00:00:31,584
This is terrible.

11
00:00:31,801 --> 00:00:34,585
It seems the four of you don't
know the meaning of harmony.

12
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:35,951
We're sorry.

13
00:00:36,114 --> 00:00:39,015
Moff... Do you even get along with each other?

14
00:02:12,104 --> 00:02:14,593
Why would the princess invite us all to dinner?

15
00:02:15,832 --> 00:02:17,646
Maybe we're about to get fired.

16
00:02:17,743 --> 00:02:19,398
Oh! I certainly hope not...

17
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:23,368
What is it, Sylphy?

18
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:28,766
Is it just me or does this tree
have more flowers than it did before?

19
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:30,512
Now that you mention it...

20
00:02:31,034 --> 00:02:32,095
Welcome!

21
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:33,402
The princess.

22
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,313
I'm so glad you all could attend!

23
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,478
Please help yourselves to whatever you like.

24
00:02:39,581 --> 00:02:41,119
Thank you so much Your Highness!

25
00:02:41,144 --> 00:02:42,494
Don't mind if I do!

26
00:02:43,087 --> 00:02:43,726
Ahhh...

27
00:02:47,686 --> 00:02:49,503
So uh... Your Majesty?

28
00:02:49,551 --> 00:02:50,220
Yes?

29
00:02:50,412 --> 00:02:52,107
Why did you invite us here?

30
00:02:52,623 --> 00:02:56,616
I heard from Sir Kanie that you ladies were
having difficulties rehearsing your new show.

31
00:02:56,641 --> 00:02:58,584
So I invited you over for sukiyaki.

32
00:02:58,701 --> 00:03:00,814
I thought it might help you relax.

33
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:02,174
That's the reason?

34
00:03:02,426 --> 00:03:03,389
Of course!

35
00:03:03,477 --> 00:03:05,226
Sheesh who cares why?

36
00:03:05,294 --> 00:03:06,829
Don't say that, Salama!

37
00:03:06,925 --> 00:03:10,752
It's rude, and you shouldn't be messing
around on your phone in front of Her Majesty!

38
00:03:11,004 --> 00:03:12,667
Fine. Sorry, princess,

39
00:03:12,716 --> 00:03:14,462
I just need to finish this post.

40
00:03:15,542 --> 00:03:18,239
Oh dear! Perhaps this wasn't a good idea after all.

41
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:19,569
No! Of course it is.

42
00:03:19,594 --> 00:03:20,882
We're having a great time!

43
00:03:20,907 --> 00:03:22,057
Having fun, Kobory?

44
00:03:22,397 --> 00:03:23,964
Sylphy too... Tell her!

45
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:24,962
Oishii ne!

46
00:03:24,987 --> 00:03:27,913
And Salama might LOOK bored,
but check out what she's typing!

47
00:03:27,938 --> 00:03:29,372
She's raving about it!

48
00:03:33,751 --> 00:03:35,500
Alright then! If you're certain.

49
00:03:35,525 --> 00:03:38,333
Come on Muse, quit acting so prim and proper.

50
00:03:38,367 --> 00:03:41,892
I'm sure the princess would want us to be upfront
with each other whether she's listening or not!

51
00:03:44,697 --> 00:03:47,790
You all formed your performance
troupe less than six months ago.

52
00:03:47,815 --> 00:03:48,779
Isn't that correct?

53
00:03:48,945 --> 00:03:49,597
Y-yes...

54
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:53,324
The original performers quit out of
nowhere so they asked us to replace them.

55
00:03:53,447 --> 00:03:56,896
You know Moffle and the others were
the ones who suggested we meet like this.

56
00:03:56,921 --> 00:03:57,511
That's right!

57
00:03:57,536 --> 00:03:58,924
He does like to bond over drinks.

58
00:03:58,949 --> 00:04:00,183
That's so lame.

59
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:02,784
Why do you have to say such negative things?

60
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:05,018
Mr. Moffle's obviously worried about us!

61
00:04:05,086 --> 00:04:05,984
Well sorry...

62
00:04:06,072 --> 00:04:07,866
Little Miss Goody Two-Shoes.

63
00:04:08,345 --> 00:04:10,348
At least I KNOW how to be nice.

64
00:04:10,373 --> 00:04:12,461
No! Stop... please don't fight! Okay?

65
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:13,331
What's that supposed to mean?

66
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:14,590
Sylphy! Make them stop.

67
00:04:14,615 --> 00:04:17,101
Like you're being extra nice in front of the princess.

68
00:04:17,126 --> 00:04:18,285
Will you drop it?

69
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,585
You should be honored to...

70
00:04:21,547 --> 00:04:23,205
Please excuse me! Ladies.

71
00:04:23,262 --> 00:04:26,207
But unfortunately, this is all the sauce we have left.

72
00:04:26,236 --> 00:04:27,177
Okay, then I'll just...

73
00:04:27,202 --> 00:04:27,819
No!

74
00:04:27,954 --> 00:04:30,588
I have to be a proper hostess for my guests.

75
00:04:30,613 --> 00:04:32,918
But we couldn't possibly make you go out!

76
00:04:32,998 --> 00:04:35,659
It's quite alright... Please wait here.

77
00:04:38,267 --> 00:04:39,889
W-What's the matter, Your Highness?

78
00:04:39,924 --> 00:04:42,969
I almost forgot to tell you all something very important.

79
00:04:43,105 --> 00:04:44,613
That red button over there...

80
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,472
Whatever you do,

81
00:04:46,733 --> 00:04:48,812
please do not touch it.

82
00:04:48,885 --> 00:04:50,371
Um... okay?

83
00:04:50,742 --> 00:04:52,625
It controls a crucial mechanism.

84
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,917
Am I clear?

85
00:04:54,587 --> 00:04:58,596
No matter what happens, you must never touch that button.

86
00:05:00,715 --> 00:05:02,890
Great. Now I'm starting to get curious.

87
00:05:02,994 --> 00:05:05,110
I wonder what would happen if we touched it.

88
00:05:05,746 --> 00:05:07,871
Welp! Only one way to find out!

89
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:10,744
Stop it Salama, she said not to...

90
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:12,675
WHAT PART OF 'STOP IT' DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?!

91
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,775
Ah! Whoaaaa!

92
00:05:16,404 --> 00:05:17,206
Ow!

93
00:05:18,019 --> 00:05:19,161
Hey watch it!

94
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:20,547
Aaah!

95
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,083
Oh goodness! What's happening?

96
00:05:36,483 --> 00:05:37,478
It couldn't be!

97
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:03,131
Luchaaa!

98
00:06:03,619 --> 00:06:05,564
There's an automated defense mode?

99
00:06:06,103 --> 00:06:08,301
Yes, as soon as someone activates it...

100
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:12,931
the system automatically eradicates anyone or
anything attempting to gain entry to the castle.

101
00:06:13,016 --> 00:06:16,275
Why would a theme park castle come
equipped with such a dangerous system?

102
00:06:16,728 --> 00:06:17,786
Because...

103
00:06:17,873 --> 00:06:20,406
It's designed for Princess Latifah's protection...

104
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:23,230
You never know when an enemy might try to infiltrate.

105
00:06:23,491 --> 00:06:25,424
Right! Aim to the right!

106
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:28,319
She's a member of the Maple Land royal family...

107
00:06:28,477 --> 00:06:30,959
so we have to take the necessary precautions.

108
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:33,154
Chaaarge!

109
00:06:33,223 --> 00:06:35,919
The automatic cannons are devastatingly accurate.

110
00:06:38,032 --> 00:06:40,178
But wait-the four spirits are inside the castle.

111
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,979
Maybe we can get in touch with them somehow.

112
00:06:42,004 --> 00:06:46,178
Apparently they have internet access,
but they're not able to get out of the room.

113
00:06:46,354 --> 00:06:51,838
Ugh, great, so the whole point of this thing is to
protect Latifah, but she's sitting outside with us.

114
00:06:51,863 --> 00:06:53,309
What good does that do?

115
00:06:53,672 --> 00:06:54,413
Ah...

116
00:06:54,709 --> 00:06:59,568
In any case, it'll be nearly impossible
to get past that cannon without casualties.

117
00:07:01,466 --> 00:07:03,361
So what, it's gonna be like this forever?

118
00:07:03,386 --> 00:07:04,097
No...

119
00:07:04,127 --> 00:07:08,105
It says here that the system deactivates after 24 hours.

120
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:10,729
All we can do for now is wait it out, I suppose.

121
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:12,617
Until 9 PM tomorrow?

122
00:07:12,855 --> 00:07:13,555
Yes...

123
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:17,012
It'll fire on anyone who gets close to the castle...

124
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:20,124
which means we have no choice but
to close the park in the meantime.

125
00:07:20,849 --> 00:07:23,327
Seriously?! Tomorrow's Saturday!

126
00:07:23,695 --> 00:07:25,647
The visitor count's been on a steady climb,

127
00:07:25,672 --> 00:07:27,702
there's no way we're not closing a whole day.

128
00:07:27,997 --> 00:07:30,144
You'd rather endanger guests?

129
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,271
She's not your girlfriend!

130
00:07:32,942 --> 00:07:35,752
Hmph... What a buncha moffin' amateurs.

131
00:07:36,429 --> 00:07:37,049
Moffle?

132
00:07:37,514 --> 00:07:39,168
Leave this to me, you hear?

133
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:40,964
What are you planning to do?

134
00:07:41,806 --> 00:07:45,295
I can't attack from the ground,
but I've still got the sky!

135
00:07:45,533 --> 00:07:46,214
Rubrum!

136
00:07:51,922 --> 00:07:52,901
Sorry...

137
00:07:52,926 --> 00:07:57,167
I'm sort of an indoor-type dragon
so flying's not really my thing...

138
00:07:57,425 --> 00:07:59,301
Yeah, well it's about to be!

139
00:08:00,818 --> 00:08:02,200
Let's go!

140
00:08:02,558 --> 00:08:03,819
O-okay!

141
00:08:05,743 --> 00:08:08,462
Lightning God Blast Technique!

142
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:14,922
Incredible!

143
00:08:14,947 --> 00:08:16,902
Hmph... piece o' moffin' cake.

144
00:08:16,927 --> 00:08:18,174
Alright! I'd better...

145
00:08:21,677 --> 00:08:23,697
M-Mr. Moffle!

146
00:08:27,201 --> 00:08:28,847
We didn't make it.

147
00:08:28,872 --> 00:08:29,965
Obviously.

148
00:08:30,152 --> 00:08:34,484
That means all we can do now is try to
flip the emergency stop switch from the inside.

149
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,333
Emergency stop switch?

150
00:08:36,406 --> 00:08:39,958
If it was that easy then why didn't
you say so in the first place, mii!

151
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:44,085
It would seem there's a hidden
passage in Her Majesty's bedroom.

152
00:08:45,215 --> 00:08:47,641
It leads to the room where the switch is located.

153
00:08:48,085 --> 00:08:49,927
Oh really? I wasn't aware of that!

154
00:08:49,952 --> 00:08:50,633
Yes...

155
00:08:51,216 --> 00:08:54,941
It also says that activating
the switch requires four people.

156
00:08:55,439 --> 00:08:56,517
And you didn't know?

157
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:02,334
Well, I suppose there's a possibility
that I knew about it previously.

158
00:09:02,359 --> 00:09:02,728
Hm?

159
00:09:03,329 --> 00:09:06,470
Then the best course of action is
to try to get in contact with them.

160
00:09:07,372 --> 00:09:11,384
Light blue vase, got it. You just want me to turn it?

161
00:09:11,725 --> 00:09:13,815
Okay then... If you say so, ma'am.

162
00:09:20,094 --> 00:09:20,915
What's that?

163
00:09:22,451 --> 00:09:23,176
Wow...

164
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:35,728
So the emergency stop switch is at the end of this tunnel?

165
00:09:36,056 --> 00:09:37,595
That's what she told me.

166
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:39,855
But I wonder why it needs four people?

167
00:09:41,533 --> 00:09:43,199
"The first challenge."

168
00:09:44,656 --> 00:09:45,706
Well, here goes.

169
00:09:45,731 --> 00:09:47,060
Be careful, Muse.

170
00:09:48,997 --> 00:09:49,542
Huh?

171
00:09:51,907 --> 00:09:53,400
What is this?!

172
00:09:53,525 --> 00:09:55,578
Why is there a karaoke room in here?

173
00:09:55,789 --> 00:09:56,851
Who knows?

174
00:09:59,823 --> 00:10:02,830
"All four have to sing to reach 300 points"...

175
00:10:02,855 --> 00:10:03,833
Oh, gosh...

176
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,370
What do they mean by "painful punishment"?

177
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:08,984
Anddd there!

178
00:10:09,088 --> 00:10:11,131
I think I set this thing up right, mii.

179
00:10:11,256 --> 00:10:12,717
I see the girls-ron!

180
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:18,780
FUN! TASY Time, FUN! TASY Fly, Fun...

181
00:10:18,837 --> 00:10:20,663
Why are they singing karaoke?

182
00:10:20,727 --> 00:10:25,561
In order to reach the stop switch... the four
of them have to overcome a series of challenges.

183
00:10:26,528 --> 00:10:28,403
And the the first one is karaoke.

184
00:10:28,831 --> 00:10:32,665
I can always tell when you've been thinkin'...

185
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,805
Muse is killin' it, mii!

186
00:10:35,856 --> 00:10:37,808
At this rate, they're sure to succeed!

187
00:10:37,838 --> 00:10:39,095
I'm not so sure.

188
00:10:39,747 --> 00:10:40,594
Why is that?

189
00:10:40,627 --> 00:10:43,681
If they pass it or not, is based
on the total of all their scores.

190
00:10:43,706 --> 00:10:48,238
Which means that if even one is a poor
singer, the entire operation will fail.

191
00:10:50,823 --> 00:10:56,578
If you're too afraid to go,
there's no way you'll ever know.

192
00:10:56,603 --> 00:11:02,128
It's not hard to learn the dance, if you take a chance.

193
00:11:02,153 --> 00:11:07,617
Hold on tight to what you love,
like a precious little dove.

194
00:11:07,642 --> 00:11:14,312
It can set you free, just believe me.

195
00:11:14,624 --> 00:11:20,291
It's a wonderful wonderful
wonderful wonderful world just for you.

196
00:11:20,387 --> 00:11:22,409
They're surprisingly good singers!

197
00:11:22,434 --> 00:11:25,329
Yeah! I thought Kobory-ron was dull as a wet paper bag.

198
00:11:25,354 --> 00:11:26,811
That was uncalled for...

199
00:11:27,281 --> 00:11:29,913
Moff, that's a pretty good score so far.

200
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:36,045
And it lives inside of you and me.

201
00:11:36,124 --> 00:11:39,566
Catch my heart.

202
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:43,344
FUN! TASY Time, FUN! TASY Fly, Fun...

203
00:11:49,319 --> 00:11:51,553
Looks like Sylphy-ron's up next.

204
00:11:52,223 --> 00:11:56,395
Couldn't bear to see you looking so sad.

205
00:11:57,582 --> 00:12:01,657
All I wanted was to take you by the hand.

206
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,792
Hmm... her voice is unique, but not bad.

207
00:12:04,939 --> 00:12:07,408
Uniqueness won't get her a high score.

208
00:12:07,822 --> 00:12:10,674
But everything should be alright
if she gets a DECENT score.

209
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,927
Let's see how Salama performs.

210
00:12:14,589 --> 00:12:19,976
Hadn't seen you in a while, but you wouldn't even smile.

211
00:12:20,001 --> 00:12:22,780
Made me wanna take that frown, turn it upside down.

212
00:12:22,805 --> 00:12:25,197
Oh my god... It's over.

213
00:12:25,447 --> 00:12:29,545
I always wondered why she never came
with us to karaoke but I think I get it now.

214
00:12:29,771 --> 00:12:30,913
Poor Salama.

215
00:12:31,338 --> 00:12:34,493
They can still make it if she racks up at least 50 points.

216
00:12:37,874 --> 00:12:43,397
It's a wonderful wonderful
wonderful wonderful world just for you.

217
00:12:43,422 --> 00:12:49,617
And just when you think you've seen
it all, you'll find something new.

218
00:12:55,614 --> 00:12:58,264
Am I supposed to be able to see their skeletons?!

219
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:00,981
Unfortunately, they failed the challenge.

220
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:04,391
Hey look, I think Muse-ron's ready to try again.

221
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:08,989
Oh no...

222
00:13:09,014 --> 00:13:11,622
I guess we have no choice but to give it another go.

223
00:13:11,647 --> 00:13:13,004
What good will that do?!

224
00:13:13,029 --> 00:13:15,756
I'm so sorry you guys. I'm just not a good singer.

225
00:13:21,476 --> 00:13:22,589
Don't you worry...

226
00:13:22,614 --> 00:13:23,494
I've got you!

227
00:13:27,441 --> 00:13:32,977
Feel the wind and kiss the
rain, let them take away the pain.

228
00:13:33,002 --> 00:13:38,534
Think of flowers every day,
or a flame that lights your way.

229
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:44,358
Every miracle here on Earth,
can't you see what they're worth.

230
00:13:44,383 --> 00:13:45,656
Your dreams can be reality...

231
00:13:45,681 --> 00:13:46,499
Much better.

232
00:13:47,009 --> 00:13:48,823
She sings so beautifully!

233
00:13:48,987 --> 00:13:52,217
If you only believe.

234
00:13:52,524 --> 00:13:57,925
It's a wonderful wonderful
wonderful wonderful world just for you.

235
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:03,478
And just when you think you've seen
it all, you'll find something new.

236
00:14:03,503 --> 00:14:09,024
It's a wonderful wonderful wonderful
wonderful world don't you see.

237
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:13,891
And it lives inside of you and me.

238
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:17,292
Catch my heart!

239
00:14:23,188 --> 00:14:24,773
We did it!

240
00:14:24,798 --> 00:14:26,168
A hundred points?!

241
00:14:26,224 --> 00:14:28,946
I knew Muse would be enough to pull them through!

242
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:35,661
Um... thanks for that.

243
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:37,186
Oh, sure.

244
00:14:43,161 --> 00:14:46,189
"All four have to dance to reach 300 points."

245
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:47,989
Again with the punishment?!

246
00:14:48,698 --> 00:14:50,905
Oh no!! Anything but dancing!

247
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:52,720
At least it's not more singing.

248
00:14:55,911 --> 00:14:58,964
Interesting, so Kobory's the weakest link this time.

249
00:14:58,989 --> 00:15:01,916
Yeah that girl couldn't dance if her life depended on it.

250
00:15:01,941 --> 00:15:04,738
That's too bad since that's exactly what's happening here.

251
00:15:16,446 --> 00:15:19,201
I-It's moving too fast! I can't keep up!

252
00:15:58,329 --> 00:15:59,822
Flour of all things?

253
00:15:59,855 --> 00:16:01,145
I'm so sorry!

254
00:16:01,218 --> 00:16:03,355
Saw that comin' a mile away.

255
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,958
But they're working so hard, this isn't fair at all!

256
00:16:06,361 --> 00:16:10,940
I still don't understand why an emergency security
system needs a goofy entertainment feature like this.

257
00:16:10,965 --> 00:16:15,203
Whoever designed this castle a long
time ago seemed to think it was necessary.

258
00:16:16,201 --> 00:16:19,597
Perhaps they thought it was
appropriate since this is a theme park.

259
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,868
Not again!

260
00:16:35,884 --> 00:16:37,580
I knew I would fail this...

261
00:16:39,013 --> 00:16:40,395
I got your back!

262
00:16:46,981 --> 00:16:48,321
I sure hope so.

263
00:17:13,181 --> 00:17:14,052
Yeah!

264
00:17:26,989 --> 00:17:27,520
Mhm!

265
00:17:30,893 --> 00:17:32,786
They managed to get through another round.

266
00:17:32,888 --> 00:17:36,766
That's interesting. They've all got different
strengths and weaknesses don't they-ron?

267
00:17:36,924 --> 00:17:41,578
Watching those brave girls put their heads
together to help each other succeed is truly touching!

268
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:44,440
There's still a chance they could moff up the next round.

269
00:17:45,725 --> 00:17:48,897
"Aim for 300 points by how fast you can type"?

270
00:17:53,957 --> 00:17:55,251
Um... ah...!

271
00:18:03,725 --> 00:18:05,856
These penalties are starting to feel lazy.

272
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:08,986
Muse is the worst typist I've ever seen-mii.

273
00:18:09,011 --> 00:18:11,575
But Salama-ron's finally found her true calling.

274
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,332
Got it!

275
00:18:27,651 --> 00:18:28,259
There!

276
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:35,017
Wow! Look at Salama's points.

277
00:18:35,123 --> 00:18:36,356
She maxed out!

278
00:18:37,815 --> 00:18:39,419
Aww yeah!

279
00:18:40,163 --> 00:18:42,478
We passed! Salama, you saved us!

280
00:18:42,557 --> 00:18:44,136
Eh, it was nothing.

281
00:18:44,221 --> 00:18:45,797
No, really, you were great!

282
00:18:54,136 --> 00:18:56,201
Tough little moffers aren't they?

283
00:18:56,314 --> 00:18:58,406
Everything's so perfect it's kinda boring.

284
00:18:58,508 --> 00:19:01,596
I agree! I would've expected
'em to give up a long time ago.

285
00:19:01,623 --> 00:19:02,680
You guys suck.

286
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:06,365
Well, according to the manual...
this is the final challenge.

287
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:10,245
I guess we're each supposed to get into one of these pods.

288
00:19:12,216 --> 00:19:13,402
Here goes.

289
00:19:21,199 --> 00:19:23,942
"Sacrifice"... Huh?

290
00:19:27,746 --> 00:19:29,114
I don't like this at all!

291
00:19:29,144 --> 00:19:32,426
The system will prompt each person
to vote for one of their peers...

292
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:35,439
whoever gets the most votes
will fall victim to a giant drill.

293
00:19:35,487 --> 00:19:36,320
But wait...

294
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:37,282
What is it now?

295
00:19:37,283 --> 00:19:39,835
If none of the candidates are voted for more than once,

296
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:42,799
then all four drills will be deactivated
and everyone will be released immediately.

297
00:19:42,824 --> 00:19:45,488
So basically if they all want to make it out in one piece

298
00:19:45,513 --> 00:19:48,546
the safest strategy is for everybody to
vote for themselves as the sacrifice, right?

299
00:19:48,571 --> 00:19:53,807
But they can't see each other, so if even
one of them betrays the other, somebody dies.

300
00:19:55,253 --> 00:19:56,289
What should I do?

301
00:19:57,912 --> 00:19:59,644
Choose a sacrifice...

302
00:20:00,176 --> 00:20:02,093
Maybe I should choose myself?

303
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,193
Or...

304
00:20:05,609 --> 00:20:06,556
I should...

305
00:20:13,344 --> 00:20:14,238
Right.

306
00:20:17,146 --> 00:20:21,046
All I want is for the four of us to
stand in the spotlight together again.

307
00:20:24,247 --> 00:20:25,112
That's why...

308
00:20:45,836 --> 00:20:48,526
Oh! Come on that was a total cop-out!

309
00:20:48,551 --> 00:20:50,535
Yeah! Where's the bloodshed-ron!

310
00:20:50,753 --> 00:20:53,121
Shut up, you two, I'm glad it worked out.

311
00:20:53,146 --> 00:20:55,259
What a beautiful ending this is!

312
00:20:55,932 --> 00:20:58,756
I guess that sukiyaki worked its magic after all.

313
00:20:59,795 --> 00:21:01,511
They opened up to each other.

314
00:21:01,619 --> 00:21:02,203
Yeah.

315
00:21:03,047 --> 00:21:08,147
Alright, get all cast members besides the rescue
squad over to the castle so they can fix things up.

316
00:21:08,686 --> 00:21:09,886
We're about to be busy.

317
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,728
And so peace was restored to the enchanted forest.

318
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:23,542
And the miracle brought about by the four
spirits became known as the Legend of Elementario!

319
00:21:31,394 --> 00:21:33,506
Thank you! Everybody! Come again!

320
00:21:33,538 --> 00:21:35,326
We hope you enjoyed the show today!

321
00:21:35,351 --> 00:21:37,097
See ya again soon dudes!

322
00:21:37,122 --> 00:21:39,225
Dhanyavadah te!

323
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:52,419
Their show sold out today.

324
00:21:52,953 --> 00:21:55,822
The other attractions are gaining in popularity as well.

325
00:21:57,035 --> 00:21:57,828
Wonderful.

326
00:21:58,313 --> 00:22:01,508
It seems there may still be a miracle in store for us.

327
00:22:04,346 --> 00:22:05,778
Remember, Lady Isuzu...

328
00:22:05,813 --> 00:22:08,182
there's one thing you mustn't tell Sir Kanie.

329
00:22:08,286 --> 00:22:09,199
Of course.

330
00:23:43,407 --> 00:23:45,941
Time for the attractions spotlight.

331
00:23:46,618 --> 00:23:49,161
I'm sure you're familiar with Maple Castle now.

332
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:51,342
Princess Latifah resides here.

333
00:23:51,367 --> 00:23:54,024
Does it really need all those extra security features?

334
00:23:54,148 --> 00:23:57,098
The king of Maple Land has a tendency to worry...

335
00:23:57,242 --> 00:24:00,544
His life motto has always been "better safe than sorry."

336
00:24:01,009 --> 00:24:04,502
Maybe we can make that alarm system
into something interesting for the guests.

337
00:24:04,738 --> 00:24:07,702
It costs us 2 million yen every time it goes off.

338
00:24:07,727 --> 00:24:09,473
Whoa, never-mind!
