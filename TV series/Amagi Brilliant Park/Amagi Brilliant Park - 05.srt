1
00:00:16,382 --> 00:00:17,523
We're out of money.

2
00:00:19,975 --> 00:00:22,762
I told you the 30 yen plan was a bad idea.

3
00:00:23,744 --> 00:00:26,073
Look, the point is, I'm really sorry,

4
00:00:26,098 --> 00:00:28,585
but we're not gonna be able to
pay anybody for this past month.

5
00:00:29,581 --> 00:00:31,580
You're not giving us a paycheck?!

6
00:00:31,605 --> 00:00:33,297
What's with that, mii?!

7
00:00:34,006 --> 00:00:36,482
Forget it! We can't give you money we don't have!

8
00:00:36,507 --> 00:00:39,577
But I have to go to the bars
and pick up all the loose women!

9
00:00:39,602 --> 00:00:40,545
No, you don't.

10
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:42,705
And I have to play pachinko!

11
00:00:42,753 --> 00:00:44,153
Again, no, you don't!

12
00:00:44,178 --> 00:00:48,975
Listen up! I need you to help me brainstorm
some ideas to help bring in some quick revenue.

13
00:00:49,348 --> 00:00:50,912
Betting on horses!

14
00:00:51,111 --> 00:00:52,180
No gambling!

15
00:00:52,501 --> 00:00:55,047
Ooh! Adults-only attractions!

16
00:00:55,496 --> 00:00:57,092
That's probably illegal.

17
00:00:57,619 --> 00:00:59,201
Moffle Punching Bag!

18
00:00:59,262 --> 00:01:00,945
You're just gonna punch right back.

19
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:02,959
I have the solution here.

20
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,566
Uh, I'm not sure what that is...

21
00:01:05,642 --> 00:01:08,278
Come on, think! There's gotta be another way!

22
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:09,845
Hmm...

23
00:01:10,165 --> 00:01:12,365
Ron! Here's an idea!

24
00:01:12,612 --> 00:01:15,015
Let's pay a visit to Dornell's Cave!

25
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:16,475
Dornell's Cave?

26
00:01:16,565 --> 00:01:18,951
You know about the secondary park, don't you?

27
00:01:19,103 --> 00:01:21,682
Yeah, I did read a little bit about it.

28
00:01:21,924 --> 00:01:23,020
So, what's the big deal?

29
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:25,611
Dornell's Cave is inside that park!

30
00:01:26,889 --> 00:01:31,303
Moff! A while back, there was a flower
fairy working here by the name of Dornell.

31
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:37,516
But one dark night, he got drunk, and set off
on a test of courage with some of his buddies.

32
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:39,365
I don't have time for the whole novel.

33
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:44,729
Anyway, they found some treasure in that cave.

34
00:03:17,581 --> 00:03:20,194
Hey, there... Could we get two crepes please?

35
00:03:22,516 --> 00:03:24,126
Uh, hello?

36
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:32,100
Huh? Didn't think it would be this grand.

37
00:03:33,218 --> 00:03:37,496
The southern region was supposed to
be a second park with a focus on sports.

38
00:03:38,592 --> 00:03:41,253
This stadium was the first element they built.

39
00:03:42,793 --> 00:03:47,413
But after the bubble burst, the plan fell
apart and they just kinda left the building here.

40
00:03:47,814 --> 00:03:49,410
It was quite disappointing.

41
00:03:49,435 --> 00:03:53,576
Ever since that happened, the entire
southern area's been completely untouched.

42
00:04:00,899 --> 00:04:05,002
And rumor has it Dornell never came
out of the cave again after that night?

43
00:04:05,047 --> 00:04:06,094
That's right.

44
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:16,221
Wait, you never told us what happened
to the friends who came in here with him.

45
00:04:16,893 --> 00:04:19,419
They looked pretty beat-up when they were found.

46
00:04:19,473 --> 00:04:20,524
One guy said:

47
00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:24,083
"There's a frickin' huge labyrinth in there, dude."

48
00:04:26,243 --> 00:04:28,377
Does that mean they ended up finding the treasure?

49
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:31,499
If that's true, we're gonna be rich, mii!

50
00:04:31,827 --> 00:04:33,330
Don't get too excited.

51
00:04:35,628 --> 00:04:36,735
It's a dead end.

52
00:04:37,127 --> 00:04:39,576
But what about the moolah?!

53
00:04:41,269 --> 00:04:43,502
Tiramy, this is embarrassing.

54
00:04:43,527 --> 00:04:47,327
I can't believe I wasted all this time
on that ridiculous story you guys told me.

55
00:04:47,451 --> 00:04:48,319
Come on, let's go.

56
00:04:48,344 --> 00:04:49,161
Check it out!

57
00:04:49,186 --> 00:04:50,797
I found a secret switch, mii!

58
00:04:50,822 --> 00:04:52,026
You call that secret?!

59
00:04:52,027 --> 00:04:54,127
Now, let's see what happens when we push it!

60
00:04:54,173 --> 00:04:55,402
No! Wait a second!

61
00:04:59,764 --> 00:05:02,012
Whoa!

62
00:05:05,651 --> 00:05:07,417
Moff! Seems legit.

63
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,308
I feel like a bad-ass, ron!

64
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:12,521
Aw, yeah! That's what I'm talkin' about, mii!

65
00:05:12,802 --> 00:05:13,882
Shall we go?

66
00:05:14,693 --> 00:05:17,760
Wait, Sento! Shouldn't we check
the place out before we just...

67
00:05:22,507 --> 00:05:25,039
We locked ourselves iiiiiin!

68
00:05:25,064 --> 00:05:26,584
We're gonna die in here!

69
00:05:26,609 --> 00:05:28,872
It was a trap, mii!

70
00:05:28,897 --> 00:05:30,607
I told you idiots!

71
00:05:32,251 --> 00:05:34,303
No way to go but forward, I guess.

72
00:05:36,331 --> 00:05:41,613
Can we come in? Mr. Kanie, we were just
hoping we could talk to you about a new show...

73
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:42,925
Huh?

74
00:05:43,227 --> 00:05:44,431
Woohoooooo!

75
00:05:44,456 --> 00:05:47,468
Miss Isuzu and Mr. Kanie must've stepped away.

76
00:05:47,493 --> 00:05:49,663
Maybe you should try texting them real quick.

77
00:05:51,373 --> 00:05:52,902
Let's see here...

78
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,538
I'm surprised we have a signal.

79
00:06:03,193 --> 00:06:05,727
Super Sylphy is at the top of her game today!

80
00:06:05,756 --> 00:06:07,097
Does that say "hole"?

81
00:06:07,122 --> 00:06:09,248
What kinda weird emoji is that?

82
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,394
Skeletooooon!

83
00:06:14,464 --> 00:06:15,387
What the...

84
00:06:15,836 --> 00:06:19,108
Whoa!

85
00:06:20,515 --> 00:06:23,068
I am the guardian of this accursed realm.

86
00:06:23,093 --> 00:06:27,227
Come, adventurers, enter the Forsaken Labyrinth of Doom!

87
00:06:27,252 --> 00:06:28,392
Did he just talk?!

88
00:06:28,417 --> 00:06:29,359
Oh my, ron!

89
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,321
Such a thing defies scientific possibility, mii!

90
00:06:32,346 --> 00:06:35,284
Oh, yeah, sure! This coming from the talking pink cat!

91
00:06:41,893 --> 00:06:43,460
Wow!

92
00:06:43,667 --> 00:06:45,871
Choose one of these coffins.

93
00:06:46,141 --> 00:06:49,017
You will be granted a weapon of ultimate power!

94
00:06:50,821 --> 00:06:53,437
Is he seriously just handing out weapons, mii?!

95
00:06:53,462 --> 00:06:56,103
I hope we don't get eternally cursed or something.

96
00:07:00,988 --> 00:07:01,805
A shovel?

97
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:03,644
And I got a stun gun.

98
00:07:04,193 --> 00:07:06,093
Check out this huge metal bat!

99
00:07:06,274 --> 00:07:08,543
Molotov cocktails! That's awesome!

100
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:10,960
Mine had a chain.

101
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:13,935
This stuff seems oddly violent for a family theme park.

102
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,293
Proceed into the darkness, fearless heroes!

103
00:07:17,318 --> 00:07:18,098
You may go!

104
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,857
I feel like something's gonna jump up out of nowhere.

105
00:07:25,093 --> 00:07:26,676
Don't let your guard down.

106
00:07:28,056 --> 00:07:29,051
What'd I step on?

107
00:07:32,331 --> 00:07:35,559
Oh man, that was close! I thought we were goners, ron!

108
00:07:35,823 --> 00:07:37,854
Y-yeah, I don't wanna be rich after all!

109
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:39,345
Let's just go home now, mii!

110
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,406
Go home?! How?!

111
00:07:41,593 --> 00:07:43,129
Calm the moff down.

112
00:07:43,154 --> 00:07:45,884
First, we need to come up with a survival strategy.

113
00:07:46,201 --> 00:07:46,908
Isuzu!

114
00:07:48,767 --> 00:07:49,588
I'm ready!

115
00:07:49,816 --> 00:07:51,496
Tiramy, we'll take the front!

116
00:07:51,808 --> 00:07:54,960
Macaron, bring up the rear and keep an eye out for traps.

117
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,948
Isuzu, protect the kid!

118
00:07:57,278 --> 00:07:59,272
Roger that, Captain Moffle!

119
00:07:59,565 --> 00:08:01,098
Do you guys hear how dumb you sound?

120
00:08:01,123 --> 00:08:03,089
Now, let's get a moff on!

121
00:08:05,164 --> 00:08:06,751
I think I just moffed up.

122
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:08,226
You what?!

123
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:10,929
Huh?

124
00:08:14,014 --> 00:08:16,281
At 12 o' clock!

125
00:08:16,736 --> 00:08:18,494
All units retreat!

126
00:08:26,354 --> 00:08:28,987
Whoo, Super Sylphy takes the lead again!

127
00:08:29,016 --> 00:08:31,703
Like I said, I don't get her choice of emoji.

128
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,073
Kanie!

129
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,586
Sento!

130
00:09:03,472 --> 00:09:05,023
Sento!

131
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,231
You're more of a jerk than I thought.

132
00:09:07,861 --> 00:09:10,251
Moff! Let's get outta here!

133
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:18,734
They got her...

134
00:09:19,194 --> 00:09:21,189
No time to cry about that.

135
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,756
We have to find a way out of this crazy place first.

136
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:26,321
I know, I just...

137
00:09:26,952 --> 00:09:28,089
Wait, mii!

138
00:09:28,278 --> 00:09:30,095
Sounds like we got company.

139
00:09:43,344 --> 00:09:44,705
What are those things?

140
00:09:44,883 --> 00:09:46,973
They're about to get their butts kicked.

141
00:09:47,258 --> 00:09:48,705
Let's moff 'em up!

142
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,557
Why would you pick a fight with them?!

143
00:09:51,994 --> 00:09:54,668
Let the men handle this, chicken boy.

144
00:09:59,892 --> 00:10:01,164
Here they come!

145
00:10:01,398 --> 00:10:02,809
Eat this!

146
00:10:05,014 --> 00:10:06,914
NOW, DANCE!

147
00:10:13,364 --> 00:10:14,898
Heh-heh-heh...

148
00:10:14,926 --> 00:10:17,043
Let the bloodbath begin!

149
00:10:17,144 --> 00:10:19,991
I'm gonna make you punks beg
for the sweet release of death!

150
00:10:20,289 --> 00:10:21,569
Can we just go?

151
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,275
Where are we?

152
00:10:32,991 --> 00:10:34,800
Some kind of holding cell.

153
00:10:35,112 --> 00:10:36,979
I need a nice long bath.

154
00:10:37,122 --> 00:10:39,080
Not till we get out of here.

155
00:10:40,904 --> 00:10:42,456
Now, how do we open this?

156
00:10:43,061 --> 00:10:44,985
Do you have like a hairpin or something to...

157
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,547
I've got something much better.

158
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,471
I always liked you, ron.

159
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,978
That's odd. Why is it so quiet?

160
00:10:56,146 --> 00:10:58,708
You'd think an alarm would go off or something like that.

161
00:11:00,085 --> 00:11:02,513
This picture is priceless!

162
00:11:11,441 --> 00:11:13,791
What kind of place is this?

163
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:16,067
Huh? Food's here already?

164
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,247
Dornell-Ron!

165
00:11:18,795 --> 00:11:20,112
You're still alive?!

166
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,224
I'm so exhausted...

167
00:11:33,251 --> 00:11:34,630
I can't dig anymore.

168
00:11:35,402 --> 00:11:38,102
I'm all out of Molotov cocktails.

169
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,438
If only there was some chemical fertilizer lying around...

170
00:11:41,811 --> 00:11:45,291
I could whip up some sick explosives
and wipe this place out, mii.

171
00:11:45,316 --> 00:11:47,915
Great, the giant, pink kitten makes bombs.

172
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,719
There's more of them!

173
00:11:52,744 --> 00:11:54,997
Are you moffin' serious?!

174
00:11:55,504 --> 00:11:57,160
And now here I am.

175
00:11:57,683 --> 00:12:00,721
So, you're telling us no one ever came here to rescue you?

176
00:12:00,884 --> 00:12:04,722
And you've spent all this time
collecting figures and watching anime,

177
00:12:04,747 --> 00:12:07,766
even getting them to set up
internet so you could play games?

178
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:12,248
And you've been down here for ten years.

179
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,868
Uh-huh! It's so comfy down here.

180
00:12:18,276 --> 00:12:20,865
Hey, would you mind bringing me something to snack on?

181
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:23,107
I'm in the mood for some potato chips today.

182
00:12:23,515 --> 00:12:25,863
Oh, and some oolong tea and three cups.

183
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:27,186
Thanks a bunch!

184
00:12:27,889 --> 00:12:30,247
Listen... Don't you have a problem with the fact that...

185
00:12:30,271 --> 00:12:33,493
everybody in the park thought you
were dead for the past ten years?

186
00:12:33,848 --> 00:12:36,010
Why didn't you tell anyone you were alive?

187
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:40,089
At first I just wanted it to be a long vacation.

188
00:12:41,122 --> 00:12:43,898
But after a while, it was too awkward to tell anyone.

189
00:12:44,674 --> 00:12:48,060
Plus, that was around the same time I got hooked on MMOs.

190
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,975
What's an MMO?

191
00:12:50,624 --> 00:12:52,440
You know, online games.

192
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:56,473
For a while there, I was logging
in for like 20 hours every day.

193
00:12:56,702 --> 00:12:58,589
That's pretty disgusting, ron.

194
00:12:58,614 --> 00:13:03,373
But how did you live your life in solitude for
all these years Without interacting with anyone?

195
00:13:03,473 --> 00:13:06,155
Well, I play as a girl, so I'm kinda popular.

196
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,115
I'm not sure how to respond to that...

197
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,188
Pardon me.

198
00:13:09,213 --> 00:13:10,002
Huh?

199
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:13,873
I brought you the chips and oolong tea you asked for.

200
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:16,127
Oh, perfect, thank you so much!

201
00:13:16,427 --> 00:13:18,181
He's even got a servant?

202
00:13:27,213 --> 00:13:30,933
I can't believe we almost died over some stupid treasure!

203
00:13:37,543 --> 00:13:39,218
A-A-A dragon?!

204
00:13:42,805 --> 00:13:45,928
Moff, it's just one thing after another today.

205
00:13:45,953 --> 00:13:47,630
We're dead, mii!

206
00:13:48,102 --> 00:13:50,033
I am known as Rubrum.

207
00:13:50,656 --> 00:13:53,095
My wisdom surpasses that of man.

208
00:13:53,758 --> 00:13:57,051
Tell me, why have you disturbed my slumber?

209
00:13:57,076 --> 00:13:59,252
Oh God, what do we do now?! He's gonna eat us!

210
00:13:59,277 --> 00:14:00,368
Just calm down.

211
00:14:00,393 --> 00:14:02,467
Man up and look him right in the eye!

212
00:14:02,546 --> 00:14:05,517
If you're so brave, stop using me as a meat shield!

213
00:14:06,017 --> 00:14:09,171
We're sorry for bothering you, Mr. Rubrum, sir.

214
00:14:09,235 --> 00:14:11,277
I promise you we're not here to make trouble.

215
00:14:11,449 --> 00:14:13,870
You see, the thing is we kinda lost our way.

216
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:16,572
So all we're trying to do is
get back to our friends safely.

217
00:14:16,683 --> 00:14:20,011
As I told you, I surpass human wisdom.

218
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:22,790
How can you hope to fool me with lies?

219
00:14:23,092 --> 00:14:25,812
You have only come here to obtain the hidden treasure!

220
00:14:25,876 --> 00:14:28,226
No, sir! I'm the acting manager of this park.

221
00:14:28,292 --> 00:14:31,042
I'm just here to do a routine
inspection of all the attractions!

222
00:14:31,067 --> 00:14:37,074
Ha! I have lived in this world for eons now,
and my intelligenceis far greater than your own.

223
00:14:37,098 --> 00:14:38,701
You cannot deceive me!

224
00:14:38,726 --> 00:14:41,810
Yeah, yeah, we get it! You're
smart or whatever. Can we move on now?

225
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:42,767
Tiramy!

226
00:14:42,871 --> 00:14:44,946
You dare insult me?

227
00:14:45,168 --> 00:14:49,610
Then, you will pay for your impertinence with your lives!

228
00:14:53,954 --> 00:14:55,829
We're in trouble now, mii!

229
00:14:55,972 --> 00:14:59,509
If I'm goin' down, I'm takin'
all these jokers down with me!

230
00:14:59,574 --> 00:15:01,811
Wait, I've got an idea.

231
00:15:01,836 --> 00:15:06,574
Hey, Rubrum! You keep telling us you're more
intelligent than all of mankind, isn't that right?

232
00:15:06,734 --> 00:15:09,767
Don't make me laugh! I can tell you're a liar!

233
00:15:11,659 --> 00:15:13,658
What did you say, human?

234
00:15:13,683 --> 00:15:17,210
I'm a hell of a lot smarter
than you are, you overgrown lizard!

235
00:15:17,547 --> 00:15:20,214
I'd certainly like to see you prove it.

236
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:22,941
You bet! Ask me any question you want.

237
00:15:23,179 --> 00:15:26,479
But if I get the right answer,
then you have to let us go free.

238
00:15:26,657 --> 00:15:28,830
Deal? Very well.

239
00:15:29,057 --> 00:15:33,692
But if you cannot answer correctly, you
had better be prepared to face my wrath.

240
00:15:33,717 --> 00:15:35,425
You got it. Let's go!

241
00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:41,267
Then answer me this, you pitiful fool of a mortal.

242
00:15:41,428 --> 00:15:43,899
It has to do with an ancient legend.

243
00:15:46,318 --> 00:15:50,233
Back in the olden days, Illimo the
First from the land of Legnum Sonim...

244
00:15:50,258 --> 00:15:56,287
<i>This little whelp couldn't possibly know the Holy
Grail of Noitomorp Runostargnoc the Wise, still...</i>

245
00:15:56,312 --> 00:16:00,030
The Holy Grail of Noitomorp Runostargnoc the Wise.

246
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:04,866
What?! B-but I haven't even finished
asking you the full question yet.

247
00:16:04,891 --> 00:16:06,569
But I was correct, wasn't I?

248
00:16:06,784 --> 00:16:08,157
Uh, well, uh...

249
00:16:08,221 --> 00:16:09,741
Was I right or not?

250
00:16:09,904 --> 00:16:11,046
You were.

251
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:11,608
Moff!

252
00:16:11,633 --> 00:16:15,950
That was absolutely incredible!
How did you know the answer to that?!

253
00:16:16,026 --> 00:16:17,926
Ha! Trade secret.

254
00:16:18,464 --> 00:16:21,472
Th-there must be some mistake! That question is taken...

255
00:16:21,497 --> 00:16:26,888
from the elite Schuvert Agricultural University's
entrance exam for the Livestock Alchemy department!

256
00:16:27,074 --> 00:16:29,069
There was no way you could have known that!

257
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:30,625
It's an exam question?

258
00:16:30,649 --> 00:16:31,362
Nerd.

259
00:16:31,387 --> 00:16:33,604
Ah, don't make fun of me!

260
00:16:33,629 --> 00:16:36,627
Regardless, I cannot allow you to leave alive!

261
00:16:36,652 --> 00:16:39,261
You know, he's not that intimidating anymore.

262
00:16:39,523 --> 00:16:40,652
That's a good point!

263
00:16:40,893 --> 00:16:43,423
I feel like I can actually take this guy now.

264
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:53,489
You're tougher than I thought. Fine!

265
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:54,492
Stop, Moffle.

266
00:16:54,517 --> 00:16:56,465
Get ready for some pain!

267
00:16:56,509 --> 00:16:59,400
Dragon Slayer Technique!

268
00:16:59,425 --> 00:17:00,627
I said stop!

269
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,487
What's your problem?!

270
00:17:02,515 --> 00:17:03,910
You're wasting your breath.

271
00:17:04,988 --> 00:17:08,597
I'm really sorry, all right? I just
got a little too carried away, that's all!

272
00:17:08,622 --> 00:17:10,746
But still, you didn't have to hit me like that!

273
00:17:10,771 --> 00:17:13,677
I mean, to be fair, I shouldn't
have let myself get all worked up

274
00:17:13,702 --> 00:17:16,362
just because you're the first
guests I've had in several years.

275
00:17:16,387 --> 00:17:17,588
Wait, "guests"?

276
00:17:17,941 --> 00:17:22,393
Yes, you're only the second group of
adventurers to visit Rubrum's Chamber of Trials...

277
00:17:22,418 --> 00:17:24,997
since this attraction came into existence.

278
00:17:25,116 --> 00:17:26,735
It wasn't real?!

279
00:17:27,364 --> 00:17:29,057
Rubrum's telling the truth.

280
00:17:29,628 --> 00:17:32,574
Sento! I'm so glad you guys are alive, mii!

281
00:17:33,613 --> 00:17:36,115
Hey, wait, that's... that's Dornell!

282
00:17:36,401 --> 00:17:38,630
Why are you guys so obsessed with me?

283
00:17:38,876 --> 00:17:41,419
Whew, boy!

284
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:50,170
An attraction that never opened?

285
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,334
Let me explain everything in detail.

286
00:17:55,602 --> 00:17:57,983
Name's Taramo. Nice to meet ya!

287
00:17:58,094 --> 00:18:00,859
I happen to be the leader of the Digerry clan.

288
00:18:01,141 --> 00:18:04,528
So you're the one in charge here? All right, I'm all ears.

289
00:18:05,225 --> 00:18:08,333
But I don't have all day, so
keep it to 20 seconds or less.

290
00:18:08,567 --> 00:18:10,077
O-kay!

291
00:18:10,633 --> 00:18:13,306
While my people have a great talent for construction,

292
00:18:13,437 --> 00:18:16,644
we've always been kinda pushed
around by the powers that be.

293
00:18:16,779 --> 00:18:21,194
Just when things were gettin' rough, the park
authorities agreed to let us take refuge here.

294
00:18:22,069 --> 00:18:25,180
But we had to make it appear on paper as an "attraction".

295
00:18:25,632 --> 00:18:27,981
There ya go, with time to spare.

296
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,377
I'm lost.

297
00:18:30,637 --> 00:18:36,317
The Digerry clan was starting to get a lot of crap from
a bunch of bullies who call themselves the Polytia Empire.

298
00:18:36,476 --> 00:18:38,923
From what I understand, it was supposed to be a secret...

299
00:18:38,948 --> 00:18:41,206
that Amabri helped get the clan out of trouble with them.

300
00:18:41,464 --> 00:18:44,282
Something suspicious was happening with money as well.

301
00:18:44,449 --> 00:18:46,241
You mean the park spent money on this?

302
00:18:46,434 --> 00:18:49,525
They gave us some construction
funds to live on at the beginning,

303
00:18:49,716 --> 00:18:53,288
but when that was gone we had to dip into our assets.

304
00:18:53,471 --> 00:18:55,769
Assets? Are you referring to...

305
00:18:56,057 --> 00:18:59,472
Oh yeah, our treasure used to
fill up this entire main hall,

306
00:18:59,497 --> 00:19:01,199
but we spent every last bit of it.

307
00:19:01,228 --> 00:19:03,058
Whaaaat?!

308
00:19:03,425 --> 00:19:05,454
That's no fair, mii!

309
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:09,093
So we came all the way down here
for nothing and risked our lives?!

310
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:14,633
Rah, rah, rah! Whoo!

311
00:19:14,895 --> 00:19:16,521
Do you think she's really okay?

312
00:19:16,546 --> 00:19:18,418
Bobsled!

313
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,432
I hear you all had quite the adventure today.

314
00:19:28,179 --> 00:19:31,103
Yeah, I wanted to talk to you about that actually.

315
00:19:35,505 --> 00:19:36,656
That's about it.

316
00:19:38,748 --> 00:19:41,269
Oh my goodness, that's quite a story.

317
00:19:46,305 --> 00:19:48,397
To tell you the truth, well, I...

318
00:19:48,861 --> 00:19:50,010
Hey!

319
00:19:51,109 --> 00:19:52,885
Miss Manager!

320
00:19:54,768 --> 00:19:55,842
Whoa, there!

321
00:19:55,867 --> 00:19:58,346
'Scuse me, coming through, sorry everybody!

322
00:19:58,701 --> 00:20:03,081
Please forgive me, friends. You see, I
wasn't able to fit through the staff corridor...

323
00:20:03,224 --> 00:20:06,382
Did you just fly your giant
dragon self over a public road?!

324
00:20:06,434 --> 00:20:07,892
Evening, Miss Manager.

325
00:20:08,543 --> 00:20:10,749
It's a pleasure to get to speak with you.

326
00:20:11,392 --> 00:20:13,814
Oh, no, the pleasure's all mine.

327
00:20:16,207 --> 00:20:17,720
Kanie, mii!

328
00:20:18,315 --> 00:20:20,009
We need to make an announcement.

329
00:20:20,473 --> 00:20:21,868
Did something bad happen?

330
00:20:22,023 --> 00:20:27,479
We did some digging, and it turns out the Polytia
Empire fell apart after a pretty nasty uprising.

331
00:20:27,504 --> 00:20:31,163
Which means the Digerry clan's got
nothing to be afraid of anymore, mii!

332
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,920
Well, that's convenient, isn't it?

333
00:20:33,051 --> 00:20:35,204
Really? Are you sure that's true?!

334
00:20:35,318 --> 00:20:35,906
Yup!

335
00:20:36,867 --> 00:20:38,683
So, we're finally free.

336
00:20:39,222 --> 00:20:43,012
In that case, would you please
consider giving all of us a job?

337
00:20:43,037 --> 00:20:43,809
A job?!

338
00:20:43,834 --> 00:20:45,841
I'd like to be employed here as well.

339
00:20:45,889 --> 00:20:48,998
I promise I'll do my VERY best to scare the visitors!

340
00:20:50,126 --> 00:20:51,009
Interesting...

341
00:20:51,259 --> 00:20:53,309
What do you say to that, Sir Kanie?

342
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:58,234
Sure, I can put you guys to work.

343
00:20:58,259 --> 00:20:59,887
Gosh, you mean it?

344
00:20:59,912 --> 00:21:01,328
Yeah, but fair warning,

345
00:21:01,353 --> 00:21:03,197
I'm gonna work you to the bone every day.

346
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:06,295
Hurray! Way to go!

347
00:21:06,577 --> 00:21:08,790
But, Kanie, what'll we do about the money?

348
00:21:09,318 --> 00:21:13,092
Oh! Just leave everything to yours truly, ron.

349
00:21:20,465 --> 00:21:22,615
Did they really build that thing overnight?!

350
00:21:23,714 --> 00:21:25,176
Yep, that's the total.

351
00:21:27,408 --> 00:21:32,657
Stop! Stop! Stop! Come back!

352
00:21:33,288 --> 00:21:37,031
Selling off Dornell's collection ought
to get us through the month at least.

353
00:21:37,602 --> 00:21:38,136
Good.

354
00:21:38,789 --> 00:21:41,397
But that doesn't exactly take care of our biggest problem.

355
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,500
What are you going to do now?

356
00:21:57,203 --> 00:21:59,735
I got the goods right here, mii!

357
00:22:00,616 --> 00:22:02,804
Sweet, I can't wait to try these babies out!

358
00:22:02,829 --> 00:22:04,680
This is gonna be killer...

359
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,471
Time for the attractions spotlight.

360
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:48,516
Today's feature is Planet Dinosaur,

361
00:23:48,574 --> 00:23:51,809
a prehistoric adventure where
dinosaurs still roam the Earth.

362
00:23:51,834 --> 00:23:54,474
I hear Triken makes an appearance here sometimes.

363
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:56,764
Oh, I thought he was just Chief of Sales.

364
00:23:56,789 --> 00:24:00,561
Kids and parents alike can't get
enough of this educational thrill ride

365
00:24:00,586 --> 00:24:03,031
from the Triassic to the Cretaceous Period.

366
00:24:03,063 --> 00:24:05,486
I see. Is there like a grand finale, too?

367
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,373
Yes, they go extinct.

368
00:24:07,493 --> 00:24:08,806
That's not fun at all!
