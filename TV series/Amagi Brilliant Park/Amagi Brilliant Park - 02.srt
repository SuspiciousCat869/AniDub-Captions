1
00:00:02,105 --> 00:00:06,005
<i>Darn, that cute office girl</i><i>isn't here today.</i>

2
00:00:06,093 --> 00:00:09,139
<i>Oh, no, I hope this skirt isn't too short.</i>

3
00:00:09,208 --> 00:00:10,876
<i>Yoritomo, 1185...</i>

4
00:00:10,901 --> 00:00:12,323
No! What happened?

5
00:00:12,423 --> 00:00:15,176
It's 1192! He's got his years mixed up!

6
00:00:15,276 --> 00:00:17,342
Just leave him alone.

7
00:00:17,447 --> 00:00:19,715
Can I assume you believe what I've told you now?

8
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:24,791
A kiss from a member of the Maple Land royal
family has the ability to grant magic powers.

9
00:00:25,922 --> 00:00:27,516
Did you say "royal family"?

10
00:00:27,615 --> 00:00:29,230
Yes, she's a Princess.

11
00:00:29,255 --> 00:00:33,426
It would appear that you've been given the power
to perceive what the people around you are thinking.

12
00:00:33,451 --> 00:00:34,348
Try it on me.

13
00:00:35,965 --> 00:00:39,080
<i>There was one other person who
possessed this power in the past,</i>

14
00:00:39,153 --> 00:00:41,875
<i>but it could never work more
than once on the same individual.</i>

15
00:00:42,192 --> 00:00:45,091
Wait, you mean if I tried to read your mind again later...

16
00:00:45,116 --> 00:00:46,017
It wouldn't work.

17
00:00:46,043 --> 00:00:49,519
You tricked me into doing it this time, so
that I'll never know what you're thinking.

18
00:00:49,622 --> 00:00:50,787
That might be the reason.

19
00:00:51,064 --> 00:00:53,771
But why would you guys want to
give me some superpower like this?

20
00:00:53,908 --> 00:00:56,495
So you'd be more inclined to take the manager position.

21
00:00:56,627 --> 00:00:58,595
We'll be returning to the park after school.

22
00:00:58,707 --> 00:00:59,546
No way...

23
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:44,999
Uncle!

24
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,329
I'm sorry I couldn't stop by
and visit you yesterday, Latifah.

25
00:02:50,354 --> 00:02:52,092
Oh, no, that's all right.

26
00:02:52,117 --> 00:02:54,415
Did you get acquainted with that Kanie kid?

27
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,058
Yes, but he fell unconscious
during the magic-granting ritual.

28
00:02:58,088 --> 00:03:01,270
So, I asked lady Isuzu to watch over him after that.

29
00:03:01,576 --> 00:03:04,488
Moff, that means he and Latifah must've...

30
00:03:04,513 --> 00:03:05,134
What?

31
00:03:05,249 --> 00:03:06,443
Don't worry about it.

32
00:03:06,926 --> 00:03:09,426
I just hope he's not inappropriate with Isuzu.

33
00:03:09,503 --> 00:03:11,367
What do you mean by "inappropriate"?

34
00:03:11,392 --> 00:03:15,681
Moff! Uh, well, you'll understand when you're older...

35
00:03:16,617 --> 00:03:18,890
Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot.

36
00:03:21,773 --> 00:03:23,673
I know it might not happen this year,

37
00:03:23,698 --> 00:03:25,581
but I'll keep on wishing for it.

38
00:03:26,342 --> 00:03:28,610
I believe that, with Sir Kanie's help,

39
00:03:28,635 --> 00:03:30,589
things might just turn around for us.

40
00:03:31,656 --> 00:03:32,561
Moff...

41
00:03:33,892 --> 00:03:35,411
Macaron!

42
00:03:35,495 --> 00:03:36,529
Tiramy!

43
00:03:36,608 --> 00:03:37,419
Ron!

44
00:03:37,608 --> 00:03:38,564
Mii!

45
00:03:38,672 --> 00:03:41,628
Aw, isn't that sweet? You've got them all to yourselves.

46
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:43,120
That was fun!

47
00:03:43,145 --> 00:03:44,089
I wanna stay, mom!

48
00:03:44,114 --> 00:03:45,337
Ron! Ron!

49
00:03:45,362 --> 00:03:46,114
Mii!

50
00:03:48,892 --> 00:03:52,259
I swear I was this close to murderlize those little brats!

51
00:03:52,284 --> 00:03:53,536
Try to relax.

52
00:03:53,621 --> 00:03:54,920
You'll never make it in this business,

53
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:57,273
if you get upset every time the kids beat you up.

54
00:03:57,381 --> 00:03:59,420
But they kept punching the crap out of me like this!

55
00:03:59,445 --> 00:04:01,042
And then they were hitting me like that!

56
00:04:01,586 --> 00:04:03,015
Hit me again, punk!

57
00:04:03,124 --> 00:04:04,507
First, they came at me like that and that...

58
00:04:04,532 --> 00:04:06,494
It's too moffin' early for this.

59
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:07,818
Oh, hey, it's Moffle!

60
00:04:07,843 --> 00:04:09,060
Good morning, Mii!

61
00:04:10,302 --> 00:04:12,834
You look even more cranky than usual.

62
00:04:12,859 --> 00:04:14,411
Yeah, it's about the kid.

63
00:04:14,492 --> 00:04:17,147
Oh, you mean the one Isuzu was giving the grand tour?

64
00:04:17,172 --> 00:04:18,857
So, what did you think of him?

65
00:04:18,968 --> 00:04:21,437
He's a narcissist with a bad attitude.

66
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:23,731
Just thinking about him pisses me off.

67
00:04:23,756 --> 00:04:25,320
Folk, good morning, everybody!

68
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:29,104
Oh, wow, you look cute as always, Muse!

69
00:04:29,615 --> 00:04:32,351
And Kobory, you're as elegant as usual.

70
00:04:32,376 --> 00:04:32,840
Thank you.

71
00:04:32,865 --> 00:04:34,926
Salama, you're as callous as ever.

72
00:04:35,452 --> 00:04:37,950
And of course Sylphy's not listening at all!

73
00:04:37,975 --> 00:04:39,553
I'm a helicopter!

74
00:04:39,578 --> 00:04:41,577
Are you girls off to Elementario?

75
00:04:41,602 --> 00:04:43,416
Yes, it's time for the first show of the day...

76
00:04:43,441 --> 00:04:45,257
If that little takes over,

77
00:04:45,282 --> 00:04:46,878
we don't stand a chance.

78
00:04:47,615 --> 00:04:49,412
I still have a ton of questions.

79
00:04:49,713 --> 00:04:52,476
I mean, what kind of place is this Maple Land anyway?

80
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:55,452
It's a magical kingdom resting
on the edge of land and water,

81
00:04:55,555 --> 00:04:57,557
and Latifah happens to be its Princess.

82
00:04:57,605 --> 00:05:01,355
Actually, there was another thing she said
before I passed out that struck me as weird.

83
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:04,063
I think she was talking about
losing the power to live or something?

84
00:05:04,184 --> 00:05:05,448
That would be Animus.

85
00:05:05,493 --> 00:05:06,313
Animus?

86
00:05:06,754 --> 00:05:10,243
It's the crystallized happiness of
all the guests who visit the park.

87
00:05:10,908 --> 00:05:13,212
Basically, Animus is our life energy.

88
00:05:14,617 --> 00:05:17,722
Amabri is a facility used to gather the Animus we need.

89
00:05:17,796 --> 00:05:21,882
All of the establishments that exist
for that purpose are what we call Argels.

90
00:05:22,035 --> 00:05:23,161
Are you trying to tell me that...

91
00:05:23,186 --> 00:05:27,402
whether or not they decide to close that old
rundown park is a life-or-death situation for you people?

92
00:05:27,476 --> 00:05:28,621
Yes, of course.

93
00:05:29,118 --> 00:05:32,367
Several other theme parks are secretly Argels as well.

94
00:05:33,002 --> 00:05:36,112
You mean Maple Land built all
those other big parks in the area too?

95
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,810
Oh, no, there are multiple magical worlds,

96
00:05:38,835 --> 00:05:41,647
so each one of them establishes an Argel for themselves.

97
00:05:41,672 --> 00:05:44,871
Magical realms are powerless without a supply of Animus.

98
00:05:44,896 --> 00:05:47,220
That's why the parks are so desperate to get guests.

99
00:05:47,724 --> 00:05:50,088
And what happens if the kingdom runs out of Animus?

100
00:05:52,322 --> 00:05:53,875
Then we cease to exist.

101
00:05:57,396 --> 00:05:59,439
How are you doing this morning, Miss Isuzu?

102
00:05:59,655 --> 00:06:00,290
Hello.

103
00:06:02,008 --> 00:06:03,911
Is that guy from the magical land?

104
00:06:04,075 --> 00:06:06,991
No, actually Okuro's an ordinary human being.

105
00:06:07,027 --> 00:06:10,691
There are several other non-magical
residents working at Amabri as well.

106
00:06:10,956 --> 00:06:11,595
What's this?

107
00:06:11,703 --> 00:06:13,931
Staff housing. I also live in there.

108
00:06:14,322 --> 00:06:17,735
But the place I wanted you to visit
today is the administrative building.

109
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,418
Here we are.

110
00:06:23,124 --> 00:06:24,031
Moff...

111
00:06:25,368 --> 00:06:26,566
Are you going to fight?

112
00:06:26,799 --> 00:06:27,922
No getting around it.

113
00:06:31,911 --> 00:06:33,559
Moff moff moff moff!

114
00:06:33,584 --> 00:06:34,654
Bring it on!

115
00:06:36,254 --> 00:06:37,962
Are you two done bonding now?

116
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,020
You really think this is bonding?!

117
00:06:40,229 --> 00:06:41,133
We should go.

118
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:42,581
We'll be late if we don't hurry up.

119
00:06:42,606 --> 00:06:44,862
Great, now what are you gonna put me through?

120
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:47,195
I want to introduce you to the enemy.

121
00:06:47,275 --> 00:06:47,972
Huh?

122
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:51,882
My name is Takaya Kurisu.

123
00:06:52,007 --> 00:06:54,152
I'm here from Amagi development.

124
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,944
Uh, thank you.

125
00:06:56,086 --> 00:06:57,641
I don't think we've met before.

126
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:59,954
That's Seiya Kanie; He's an intern.

127
00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:01,834
Shouldn't the manager be here as well?

128
00:07:01,859 --> 00:07:03,913
She wasn't feeling very well today.

129
00:07:04,106 --> 00:07:08,119
Since I'm the acting manager, I'll
be the one to consider your proposal.

130
00:07:08,323 --> 00:07:10,383
I see; That's all right then.

131
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:13,041
I'm sure you already know this,

132
00:07:13,256 --> 00:07:19,283
but your contract stipulates that the annual visitor count
must be calculated beginning on August 1st of every year,

133
00:07:19,308 --> 00:07:22,562
and that if you fall short of half a
million guests for five years in a row,

134
00:07:22,587 --> 00:07:25,079
Amagi development receives full control of the park.

135
00:07:25,104 --> 00:07:25,762
Yes.

136
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:30,558
The park has fallen below 500,000
attendees for four consecutive years now.

137
00:07:30,735 --> 00:07:33,618
You're at 250,000 for the year.

138
00:07:33,862 --> 00:07:35,176
And it's already May.

139
00:07:35,448 --> 00:07:38,043
I'm afraid you have less than three months remaining.

140
00:07:38,695 --> 00:07:41,169
And you see, from where I'm standing,

141
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:43,823
you haven't even begun preparations to shut down.

142
00:07:44,016 --> 00:07:46,451
That's correct. Because we can't be certain that...

143
00:07:46,481 --> 00:07:49,801
the visitor count won't surpass
500,000 before the deadline is up.

144
00:07:51,588 --> 00:07:53,328
Tell me you're not serious.

145
00:07:53,408 --> 00:07:56,029
Summer break is just around
the corner. I'm sure we'll get...

146
00:07:56,066 --> 00:07:58,352
Summer break starts in late July.

147
00:07:58,789 --> 00:08:01,579
Two weeks won't be enough to save your park.

148
00:08:02,293 --> 00:08:04,643
You're generating a considerable deficit.

149
00:08:04,963 --> 00:08:07,751
If I were you, I'd start getting my assets in order.

150
00:08:08,485 --> 00:08:10,833
Allow me to give you a little example here.

151
00:08:10,873 --> 00:08:15,089
Let's say a family of four takes
a vacation to Amagi Brilliant Park.

152
00:08:15,186 --> 00:08:18,421
Would you make a profit based on last year's attendance?

153
00:08:18,446 --> 00:08:22,332
Well, it depends on how much the
family needs to spend every day,

154
00:08:22,357 --> 00:08:23,416
which is...

155
00:08:23,907 --> 00:08:25,179
85,000 yen.

156
00:08:29,372 --> 00:08:31,152
That's almost on the nose.

157
00:08:31,376 --> 00:08:33,993
It's actually 83,200.

158
00:08:35,282 --> 00:08:36,573
That was quite impressive.

159
00:08:36,777 --> 00:08:38,675
How would you like to come work with us?

160
00:08:38,777 --> 00:08:40,869
Nah, don't think I'm interested.

161
00:08:41,214 --> 00:08:42,332
Well that's a shame.

162
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,640
In any case, those are the numbers we're looking at here.

163
00:08:46,082 --> 00:08:49,420
You just can't keep up this
indulgence of yours for much longer.

164
00:08:49,885 --> 00:08:53,370
But, sir, if you give us a chance, then maybe we could...

165
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:55,379
A chance, huh?

166
00:08:56,094 --> 00:08:58,650
Face it, the only thing you can do now is pray that...

167
00:08:58,675 --> 00:09:03,079
another quarter million people are stupid
enough to waste their time at this dump.

168
00:09:03,104 --> 00:09:04,333
No offense.

169
00:09:12,987 --> 00:09:15,118
You didn't tell me you were the acting manager.

170
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,388
Princess Latifah needed me to do
it for a year to take her place.

171
00:09:21,526 --> 00:09:26,578
Did you come up with the 85,000 yen because
you were reading Mr. Kurisu's mind earlier?

172
00:09:26,603 --> 00:09:31,035
No, all I did was make a rough estimate based on
the size of the park and yesterday's visitor count.

173
00:09:31,217 --> 00:09:33,469
It's a little math trick called a Fermi estimate.

174
00:09:33,918 --> 00:09:34,866
I don't understand.

175
00:09:34,936 --> 00:09:36,118
Look it up sometime.

176
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:39,348
More importantly, why did you bring
me here to meet with those people?

177
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,617
If you're going to be the manager of Amabri,

178
00:09:44,761 --> 00:09:47,147
you'll need to know who we're up against.

179
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:49,796
Would you just drop it?

180
00:09:52,849 --> 00:09:55,578
You take away my free time
after school and on the weekends,

181
00:09:55,603 --> 00:09:58,060
you repeatedly threaten me
with that ridiculous gun of yours,

182
00:09:58,085 --> 00:10:01,154
and yet you still expect me to
help you save this stupid theme park?

183
00:10:01,222 --> 00:10:03,828
Who in their right mind would say yes after all that?

184
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:09,822
I'm sorry, I'm not quite accustomed to this world yet.

185
00:10:09,851 --> 00:10:13,060
I don't know the appropriate
way to ask for someone's help.

186
00:10:13,376 --> 00:10:14,892
So you shoot them?

187
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:15,657
Yes.

188
00:10:16,247 --> 00:10:20,448
Steinberger is a magical weapon
compatible with several types of bullets.

189
00:10:20,473 --> 00:10:21,378
Put that away!

190
00:10:21,403 --> 00:10:24,244
The bullet I shot you with
before was called a Pain Bringer.

191
00:10:24,269 --> 00:10:28,205
That variety is enough to cause double the
amount of pain of stubbing your pinky toe.

192
00:10:28,277 --> 00:10:29,249
Put it down!

193
00:10:29,345 --> 00:10:33,678
Plus I don't see why you would ask me instead of
somebody with professional management experience.

194
00:10:33,806 --> 00:10:36,065
We tried that, but then they all quit on us.

195
00:10:36,449 --> 00:10:37,027
Why?

196
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:38,910
Perhaps they didn't like being shot at.

197
00:10:38,935 --> 00:10:39,469
Really?!

198
00:10:39,494 --> 00:10:41,123
I feel like this is all my fault.

199
00:10:41,225 --> 00:10:42,849
That's why I came to your school.

200
00:10:42,923 --> 00:10:46,698
I was so desperate, I needed you to
agree to help no matter what the cost!

201
00:10:49,494 --> 00:10:50,597
I've had enough.

202
00:10:51,124 --> 00:10:51,878
You're leaving?!

203
00:10:51,915 --> 00:10:52,281
Yep.

204
00:10:52,383 --> 00:10:55,283
But you can't! You're the only chance we've got, Kanie!

205
00:10:55,308 --> 00:10:56,357
Please save our park!

206
00:10:56,382 --> 00:10:57,306
I can't help you.

207
00:10:57,331 --> 00:10:58,624
But what about the Princess?!

208
00:11:14,468 --> 00:11:15,298
Hey, there.

209
00:11:16,262 --> 00:11:16,869
Hey.

210
00:11:24,403 --> 00:11:25,231
What now?

211
00:11:25,378 --> 00:11:27,682
You're Seiya Kodama, the child actor!

212
00:11:28,924 --> 00:11:29,930
You're mistaken.

213
00:11:30,497 --> 00:11:31,930
No, no, I'm sure.

214
00:11:32,139 --> 00:11:37,369
But why's a big celebrity like you
working part-time in a rundown amusement park?

215
00:11:37,394 --> 00:11:38,231
I said-

216
00:11:40,647 --> 00:11:41,951
It's none of your business.

217
00:11:42,574 --> 00:11:44,710
Well, I'm sure you've got your reasons,

218
00:11:44,735 --> 00:11:45,960
but here's some advice:

219
00:11:46,224 --> 00:11:47,659
Don't be stupid, all right?

220
00:11:49,105 --> 00:11:51,249
If you spend your time around losers,

221
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:53,427
you'll end up a loser yourself.

222
00:11:54,777 --> 00:11:55,849
Take care.

223
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,444
I guess the corners are round so kids don't get hurt.

224
00:12:29,246 --> 00:12:33,216
How can they have time for little details
like that when the place is such a wreck?

225
00:12:34,572 --> 00:12:37,308
Jeez, get your priorities in order.

226
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:49,282
Either way, I should get them to do
something about these crazy psychic powers.

227
00:13:00,391 --> 00:13:03,120
I hope they're not gonna give us some kind of bad news.

228
00:13:03,501 --> 00:13:06,302
I'm surprised you haven't
already heard something, Mr. Moffle.

229
00:13:06,671 --> 00:13:08,907
What's your take on it, Mr. Cast-Leader?

230
00:13:08,975 --> 00:13:12,439
Moff, I bet it's exactly what you think it is.

231
00:13:13,403 --> 00:13:15,594
Everyone, your attention please!

232
00:13:16,114 --> 00:13:20,236
The first Princess of Maple Land,
her royal highness Latifah Fullanza,

233
00:13:20,261 --> 00:13:21,936
would like to address her subjects!

234
00:13:22,202 --> 00:13:23,875
This is an important message!

235
00:13:23,982 --> 00:13:25,971
All right, let's get this over with.

236
00:13:25,996 --> 00:13:27,793
I had a feeling this was coming.

237
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:29,881
These people sure do give up easily.

238
00:13:29,906 --> 00:13:31,420
Can't really blame 'em.

239
00:13:34,621 --> 00:13:40,694
Good evening, my friends. It is with a heavy heart
that I must impart some very upsetting news today.

240
00:13:41,073 --> 00:13:45,572
In three months' time, our Amagi
Brilliant Park will be permanently shut down.

241
00:13:47,499 --> 00:13:49,384
I know it hurts to say goodbye,

242
00:13:49,883 --> 00:13:53,727
but I promise I'll do everything I can
to find new jobs for every one of you.

243
00:13:54,486 --> 00:13:57,567
And even though the road ahead is
certain to introduce some challenges...

244
00:13:57,593 --> 00:13:59,282
Challenges, really?!

245
00:13:59,412 --> 00:14:03,032
But, your majesty, hardly anybody
out there even knows who I am!

246
00:14:03,063 --> 00:14:05,256
It's too late for me to build up a fan base now!

247
00:14:05,281 --> 00:14:06,215
What am I gonna do?!

248
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:06,871
Well I...

249
00:14:08,096 --> 00:14:10,074
I'm not quite sure, but if you try hard then...

250
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,793
What's the use of trying?!

251
00:14:11,969 --> 00:14:15,823
I'll just wind up passing out tissues
in front of some train station anyway!

252
00:14:16,129 --> 00:14:17,575
And then before you know it,

253
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,855
Everybody'll forget about me forever!

254
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,646
Without fans, I'll just disappear!

255
00:14:24,676 --> 00:14:27,402
How could you let us down like this, Princess?!

256
00:14:28,097 --> 00:14:30,244
Put a sock in it, Wanipee.

257
00:14:30,408 --> 00:14:31,709
But I'm sad!

258
00:14:31,811 --> 00:14:34,241
How many years have you worked at Amabri?

259
00:14:34,405 --> 00:14:35,680
About 12.

260
00:14:36,514 --> 00:14:39,280
Then you've had more than enough chances.

261
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:42,101
It's your own fault you relied too much on the park

262
00:14:42,138 --> 00:14:44,878
and didn't establish your own fan base.

263
00:14:45,065 --> 00:14:47,127
So why are you making a scene?

264
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:51,844
Because... becaaaaause!

265
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:55,066
Don't worry, Wanipee.

266
00:14:55,107 --> 00:14:58,353
I'll be right there passing out tissues with you, okay?

267
00:14:58,574 --> 00:15:04,091
If you work hard, you still have a chance of being
successful as a local mascot or something like that.

268
00:15:04,805 --> 00:15:06,460
Easy for you to say.

269
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:07,765
Moff?

270
00:15:08,068 --> 00:15:12,634
Come on, Moffle, we both know you could
easily move on to some other theme park.

271
00:15:12,659 --> 00:15:14,709
Why would I do a fool thing like that?

272
00:15:14,734 --> 00:15:18,364
You're practically identical
to Macky at Urayasu Digimarland!

273
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:20,060
Did you really think nobody noticed?!

274
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:20,821
Moff...

275
00:15:20,922 --> 00:15:22,294
He's a mouse too, I'm sure you could get a good gig as...

276
00:15:22,319 --> 00:15:24,299
I'm nobody's sidekick! Got it?!

277
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:26,945
I've built my career on originality!

278
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:29,301
I'm not a knockoff or a sidekick, buster!

279
00:15:29,326 --> 00:15:31,034
That hurts! Let me go!

280
00:15:31,059 --> 00:15:32,503
Both of you, cut it out!

281
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:35,309
We're in front of the Princess, Ron!

282
00:15:36,294 --> 00:15:38,596
She's suffering more than anybody right now.

283
00:15:38,621 --> 00:15:40,139
Can't you two see that?

284
00:15:43,313 --> 00:15:45,125
Sorry I got upset.

285
00:15:46,197 --> 00:15:46,888
No...

286
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,338
This is all my fault.

287
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:51,727
I've failed.

288
00:15:52,116 --> 00:15:53,623
I'm so sorry!

289
00:15:54,122 --> 00:15:56,863
If only I'd been able to save this place...

290
00:15:57,537 --> 00:15:59,250
I know it's not enough, but...

291
00:15:59,539 --> 00:16:01,443
I truly do apologize.

292
00:16:02,287 --> 00:16:03,261
And I hope...

293
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:05,760
I hope you'll all forgive me...

294
00:16:06,504 --> 00:16:07,758
If you can.

295
00:16:12,311 --> 00:16:14,957
Don't you think it's a little early for you to apologize?

296
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:25,188
You really are a hopeless bunch.

297
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:27,094
If you're gonna feel sorry for yourselves,

298
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:29,307
at least wait until you've actually lost.

299
00:16:29,403 --> 00:16:31,955
Is he the one the prophesy told us about?

300
00:16:32,233 --> 00:16:32,766
Huh?

301
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:36,548
What are you doing back here, punk?

302
00:16:36,573 --> 00:16:37,846
If I remember correctly,

303
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:40,176
you clowns forced me to come here against my will.

304
00:16:40,201 --> 00:16:42,467
They told me you turned down the manager position.

305
00:16:42,492 --> 00:16:44,163
Just get lost already!

306
00:16:44,188 --> 00:16:48,374
I don't think so. I'm actually in the mood to
help you losers with your little problem now.

307
00:16:48,992 --> 00:16:51,010
We can handle it just fine on our own!

308
00:16:51,035 --> 00:16:53,133
We don't need help from the likes of you!

309
00:16:53,158 --> 00:16:55,348
Heh! Yeah, you look like you're handling it.

310
00:16:55,373 --> 00:16:56,374
Moffu?

311
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:57,299
Come on!

312
00:16:57,424 --> 00:16:59,173
Every one of you is useless!

313
00:16:59,523 --> 00:17:01,488
You can't attract business or make money,

314
00:17:01,513 --> 00:17:03,745
and now you're all about to lose your jobs!

315
00:17:03,892 --> 00:17:07,169
Oh, and guess what that guy from
Amagi development said to me earlier.

316
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,475
That you'd have to be a moron to
spend your money at this trash heap!

317
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:11,841
He's right!

318
00:17:11,871 --> 00:17:15,157
The poor, misguided saps who do come
are wasting their hard-earned cash...

319
00:17:15,181 --> 00:17:19,621
on a pitiful excuse for an amusement park
that's not even bad enough to be so-bad-it's-good!

320
00:17:19,646 --> 00:17:21,766
Seriously, even I don't know what to say to that!

321
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,462
And what have you idiots been doing in the meantime?

322
00:17:24,831 --> 00:17:27,643
Nothing! You're just whining and complaining!

323
00:17:27,673 --> 00:17:31,992
It's true! I'd feel pretty stupid if I
gave my money to a pathetic lot like you!

324
00:17:32,197 --> 00:17:34,289
All right, now I'm really getting mad!

325
00:17:34,314 --> 00:17:35,725
Please stand down.

326
00:17:35,816 --> 00:17:37,894
I do apologize, Sir Kanie.

327
00:17:38,133 --> 00:17:40,698
Would you please come and join us on the balcony?

328
00:17:41,072 --> 00:17:41,959
Heh...

329
00:17:45,383 --> 00:17:47,178
I should introduce myself.

330
00:17:47,386 --> 00:17:48,958
Name's Seiya Kanie.

331
00:17:48,983 --> 00:17:51,882
And I don't even have to read your
minds to know what you're all thinking.

332
00:17:52,001 --> 00:17:53,400
Let me see here, uh...

333
00:17:53,507 --> 00:17:56,452
Aha! That's right, you hate my guts already, don't you?

334
00:17:56,515 --> 00:17:57,948
"Where'd this jerk come from?"

335
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:00,800
"How can we entrust him with our precious park?"

336
00:18:01,027 --> 00:18:03,456
"What could he possibly do in three months?"

337
00:18:04,164 --> 00:18:05,568
And that's not all!

338
00:18:05,593 --> 00:18:08,203
"Princess Latifah with a jackass like him?"

339
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,027
"I can't bear to think about it!"

340
00:18:10,704 --> 00:18:12,767
Have I pissed you off enough? Good!

341
00:18:13,116 --> 00:18:15,747
From now on, it's not in your hands anymore.

342
00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:17,823
I'm your new dictator!

343
00:18:18,485 --> 00:18:21,067
If you don't like that, I'll fire you right now!

344
00:18:21,096 --> 00:18:23,237
You will do exactly as I tell you to do!

345
00:18:23,481 --> 00:18:25,806
This lousy park is gonna close down either way,

346
00:18:25,831 --> 00:18:27,379
so I might as well do what I want!

347
00:18:27,486 --> 00:18:31,002
That said, I guarantee you'll be amazed in the end.

348
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:37,356
In these three months, this random kid you hate
is gonna pull off a miracle like you've never seen!

349
00:18:38,036 --> 00:18:40,949
I'll get you those 250,000 customers.

350
00:18:41,272 --> 00:18:43,123
And that prophesy or whatever?

351
00:18:43,148 --> 00:18:44,941
I will make it come true!

352
00:18:49,994 --> 00:18:51,003
A stunt?

353
00:18:51,189 --> 00:18:53,855
Yeah, I made them angry on purpose.

354
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:55,416
Why would you do that?

355
00:18:56,102 --> 00:18:58,722
Well, when I told them your customers were all morons,

356
00:18:58,747 --> 00:19:00,524
that made the cast get really mad.

357
00:19:00,915 --> 00:19:04,497
The fact that they were that offended
by me talking smack about the customers...

358
00:19:04,522 --> 00:19:05,925
means they're serious.

359
00:19:06,072 --> 00:19:07,340
So, there's still hope.

360
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:10,120
Oh, I never thought of that.

361
00:19:10,145 --> 00:19:12,566
You mean, you've decided to help us out after all?

362
00:19:12,989 --> 00:19:13,738
Yeah.

363
00:19:14,481 --> 00:19:16,698
Three months, no more, no less.

364
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,616
After that, I'm washing my hands of all of this.

365
00:19:19,989 --> 00:19:23,060
Right. You have my deepest gratitude.

366
00:19:25,204 --> 00:19:27,071
Don't go thanking me just yet.

367
00:19:27,825 --> 00:19:29,908
Well, I'm gonna give it my best shot, but...

368
00:19:30,155 --> 00:19:31,738
Just don't get your hopes up.

369
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:33,689
It's virtually impossible.

370
00:19:33,789 --> 00:19:35,730
But what about your big speech earlier?!

371
00:19:35,755 --> 00:19:37,265
I said what I had to.

372
00:19:38,818 --> 00:19:42,081
If we want to succeed here, we
need them to have a little hope left.

373
00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:46,822
Well, in that case, I won't give up either.

374
00:19:47,027 --> 00:19:49,689
Because your prophesy tells
you I'm gonna make this happen?

375
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:50,801
No.

376
00:19:51,192 --> 00:19:54,755
The oracle does give us a little guidance for our lives,

377
00:19:54,779 --> 00:19:58,089
but I have no idea what the future truly holds for us.

378
00:19:58,181 --> 00:19:59,476
Then what's your reason?

379
00:19:59,855 --> 00:20:02,636
Because you agreed to help us save the park, Sir Kanie.

380
00:20:02,936 --> 00:20:05,014
I know things are going to change.

381
00:20:05,989 --> 00:20:09,665
And I believe that Amabri has a
chance to make a brighter future.

382
00:20:13,594 --> 00:20:15,602
These are the documents you asked for.

383
00:20:15,829 --> 00:20:16,577
Thanks.

384
00:20:16,688 --> 00:20:18,010
Is there anything else?

385
00:20:18,282 --> 00:20:18,991
No.

386
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,181
Did you let your family know
you wouldn't be going home tonight?

387
00:20:23,782 --> 00:20:24,541
Yeah.

388
00:20:25,001 --> 00:20:27,601
I'll leave a blanket for you so you can get some sleep.

389
00:20:27,869 --> 00:20:28,593
'Kay.

390
00:20:32,002 --> 00:20:32,966
And Kanie?

391
00:20:35,512 --> 00:20:36,549
Thanks for this.

392
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,423
Sure.

393
00:20:43,781 --> 00:20:46,334
Hey! Good to see you again, Mr. Moffle!

394
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:47,816
Chilled tomatoes and a beer.

395
00:20:47,841 --> 00:20:48,629
'Kay!

396
00:20:49,794 --> 00:20:52,104
Yo buddy, Ron! Started without ya.

397
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,579
Mii, what took ya?

398
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:54,826
Moff!

399
00:20:54,946 --> 00:20:57,694
Sorry to keep you waiting, sir. I brought you a beer!

400
00:20:57,719 --> 00:20:58,266
Moff.

401
00:20:58,296 --> 00:21:01,239
Hey, baby, Ron, could you bring
us two more of those, please?

402
00:21:01,263 --> 00:21:01,937
Uh-huh.

403
00:21:01,999 --> 00:21:04,428
And hurry back with that sweet ass, Mii!

404
00:21:04,452 --> 00:21:05,273
Oh, you!

405
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:08,535
You really ought to watch your language
when you go out in public, Tiramy.

406
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,001
You never know who might be listening to what you say.

407
00:21:11,026 --> 00:21:14,292
Relax, that's what these Rarapazzi charms are for.

408
00:21:14,378 --> 00:21:16,377
As long as we're wearing these babies,

409
00:21:16,402 --> 00:21:17,966
Nobody'll find out we're fairies!

410
00:21:18,074 --> 00:21:20,346
Those only change your appearance, you knucklehead.

411
00:21:20,371 --> 00:21:23,270
We'd be in hot water if word got out that an Amabri mascot

412
00:21:23,295 --> 00:21:26,018
was drinking beer and checking out women's butts!

413
00:21:26,228 --> 00:21:29,288
Mii! Stop tellin' me how to live my life!

414
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:33,054
What's the fun of goin' out drinkin'
if you can't check out the tits and ass?!

415
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:34,746
You better zip that dirty mouth!

416
00:21:34,771 --> 00:21:36,421
Stop acting so stupid!

417
00:21:36,446 --> 00:21:37,909
We're sorry.

418
00:21:38,023 --> 00:21:39,939
And cheers!

419
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,079
What's gotcha down today, Moff-man?

420
00:21:42,104 --> 00:21:43,740
Is it that Kanie kid again?

421
00:21:44,253 --> 00:21:44,973
Moff!

422
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:47,982
Well, we might as well stick it out till the end, right?

423
00:21:48,136 --> 00:21:51,022
I'm kinda curious to see what his game plan is, honestly.

424
00:22:00,647 --> 00:22:04,525
What the hell does that rat bastard think he's doing?!

425
00:23:45,878 --> 00:23:48,458
Time for the attractions spotlight.

426
00:23:49,685 --> 00:23:52,760
Today's feature is Macaron's music theatre.

427
00:23:52,793 --> 00:23:55,265
I haven't been in there yet. What's it like?

428
00:23:55,296 --> 00:23:59,765
A sanctuary of sound filled to the
brim with the most prestigious of legends.

429
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:03,050
Wow, that sounds pretty
sophisticated. What kind of legends?

430
00:24:03,075 --> 00:24:07,923
Like when Macaron got into a fist-fight with some
rude audience members and the whole stage collapsed.

431
00:24:07,948 --> 00:24:09,450
That's prestigious?!
