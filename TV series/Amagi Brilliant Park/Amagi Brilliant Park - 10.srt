1
00:00:05,137 --> 00:00:06,470
Moff! Moff!

2
00:00:06,495 --> 00:00:07,862
Ro‐Ron! Ro‐Ron!

3
00:00:07,887 --> 00:00:09,021
Mii!

4
00:00:14,422 --> 00:00:16,690
I'll be takin' this pool fer me own!

5
00:00:16,715 --> 00:00:18,283
Somebody rescue me!

6
00:00:18,308 --> 00:00:21,166
Oh no! The pirates are taking that mermaid hostage!

7
00:00:21,191 --> 00:00:22,224
What should we do?

8
00:00:22,249 --> 00:00:23,035
I'm scared!

9
00:00:23,862 --> 00:00:25,530
Quiet, ye barnacles...!

10
00:00:25,555 --> 00:00:28,757
Cross me and ye'll all be sleepin' with the fishes!

11
00:00:29,009 --> 00:00:30,714
Not so fast, pirate!

12
00:00:32,713 --> 00:00:34,102
What the blazes...?

13
00:00:36,225 --> 00:00:37,859
Curse ye, scurvy sea‐worm!

14
00:00:37,884 --> 00:00:40,169
Genjuro the dolphin's here to save the day!

15
00:00:40,194 --> 00:00:41,387
Let's give him a hand!

16
00:00:41,412 --> 00:00:43,424
Come get your Popsicle!

17
00:00:44,726 --> 00:00:46,593
Wow! They look super real!

18
00:00:46,618 --> 00:00:48,015
Ew, get it away!

19
00:00:49,598 --> 00:00:51,708
I far exceed human intelligence.

20
00:00:51,733 --> 00:00:53,969
How dare you raise your blade to me?

21
00:00:55,523 --> 00:00:57,549
Impudent fools!

22
00:00:58,276 --> 00:00:59,476
Omigod I love this!

23
00:00:59,501 --> 00:01:01,782
Me too! How do they do this stuff?

24
00:01:12,129 --> 00:01:12,853
Welcome...

25
00:01:13,255 --> 00:01:15,360
...to Amagi Brilliant Park!

26
00:01:16,752 --> 00:01:18,902
The Starlight World show starts...

27
00:01:19,034 --> 00:01:19,767
...now!

28
00:01:19,792 --> 00:01:21,156
Ron! Moff! Miiii!!!

29
00:01:39,693 --> 00:01:41,476
Evening hours are working out okay.

30
00:01:41,758 --> 00:01:44,649
Yes... We haven't had any issues so far.

31
00:01:44,874 --> 00:01:46,128
I think it's a good move.

32
00:03:23,384 --> 00:03:25,151
So how are the renewals coming along?

33
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:26,940
Let me give you a quick update.

34
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,009
Whoa!

35
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,153
We added more audience interaction.

36
00:03:32,528 --> 00:03:33,593
I don't think so!

37
00:03:39,374 --> 00:03:42,207
Heavy metal music is much more participatory.

38
00:03:42,315 --> 00:03:43,897
Why are they all in sync?!

39
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:48,180
Sweet, guns!

40
00:03:48,822 --> 00:03:50,325
Let's slaughter 'em!

41
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,064
Moff!

42
00:04:00,213 --> 00:04:00,625
Mission completed.

43
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,544
This one was highly requested by visitors.

44
00:04:02,569 --> 00:04:03,871
Which visitors?!

45
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:06,436
A girl!

46
00:04:06,461 --> 00:04:07,040
Yeah!

47
00:04:07,065 --> 00:04:07,749
Kidnap her!

48
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,325
Heheh!

49
00:04:10,446 --> 00:04:12,980
How could every single one of these be so terrible?

50
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:15,452
They ARE performing well with the guests.

51
00:04:16,588 --> 00:04:19,848
Summer break is coming up soon,
so attendance should keep improving.

52
00:04:23,193 --> 00:04:24,008
I guess so.

53
00:04:25,352 --> 00:04:27,781
There you are, Mr. Kanie!

54
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,977
I couldn't find you!

55
00:04:30,131 --> 00:04:31,585
Sorry, Triken.

56
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,560
The TV station is here to film.

57
00:04:33,997 --> 00:04:35,469
Okay... Be right there.

58
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:38,505
Oh and... that thing you mentioned...

59
00:04:38,654 --> 00:04:40,389
Right! Did you find something?

60
00:04:41,996 --> 00:04:44,406
Well, it doesn't look very promising, sir.

61
00:04:45,046 --> 00:04:45,727
I see.

62
00:04:47,256 --> 00:04:48,902
Anyway... keep working hard.

63
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:50,040
Absolutely!

64
00:04:51,077 --> 00:04:54,204
What a great crowd... especially for a weekday!

65
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:58,082
Amagi Brilliant Park is enjoying a surge in popularity,

66
00:04:58,107 --> 00:05:00,557
so let's see what the hype's all about!

67
00:05:00,586 --> 00:05:05,024
This little guy's not only cute,
but he's a super great juggler too!

68
00:05:05,049 --> 00:05:06,890
Wow...! Hey, I think I see...

69
00:05:06,915 --> 00:05:09,398
That reporter there certainly has some impressive assets.

70
00:05:09,423 --> 00:05:12,316
That's it. I'm gonna find
somebody else to show her around.

71
00:05:13,093 --> 00:05:13,727
That's not fair!

72
00:05:13,752 --> 00:05:17,316
More importantly, there's a magazine
coming to do a special on us tomorrow.

73
00:05:17,423 --> 00:05:18,991
You've got the schedule, right?

74
00:05:19,332 --> 00:05:22,130
Right! And I've seen tomorrow's representative...

75
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,161
Her assets are even better so...

76
00:05:24,474 --> 00:05:24,930
I'll be hunched over with...

77
00:05:24,955 --> 00:05:27,365
Great. Then I'll find somebody else to speak with her.

78
00:05:27,982 --> 00:05:29,364
I take it back!

79
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:34,584
Ahhh!

80
00:05:34,609 --> 00:05:35,329
Moff!

81
00:05:36,728 --> 00:05:39,288
Hey Takami, we're ready to order now.

82
00:05:40,582 --> 00:05:41,323
Coming!

83
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:42,261
Hey sexy!

84
00:05:42,286 --> 00:05:43,235
What'll it be?

85
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:47,244
More beers, edamame, and miso cucumbers, right?

86
00:05:47,501 --> 00:05:48,399
Yes please.

87
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:49,905
And some octopus‐ron.

88
00:05:50,008 --> 00:05:50,649
Right!

89
00:05:50,877 --> 00:05:52,453
I'll take the Takami special!

90
00:05:52,487 --> 00:05:53,182
No sir.

91
00:05:53,183 --> 00:05:54,687
Takami soup and salad?

92
00:05:54,711 --> 00:05:55,298
No sir.

93
00:05:55,623 --> 00:05:57,151
Takami sandwi...

94
00:05:57,176 --> 00:05:58,533
Great... What else?

95
00:05:58,558 --> 00:05:59,770
Cold tofu‐ron.

96
00:05:59,795 --> 00:06:01,630
And maybe some omelet rolls too.

97
00:06:01,655 --> 00:06:02,500
You got it!

98
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:03,691
That'll be all.

99
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:04,548
Thanks.

100
00:06:04,868 --> 00:06:07,827
I tell ya, the drinks taste even
better now that business is so good!

101
00:06:07,927 --> 00:06:10,175
We're getting more and more visitors every day!

102
00:06:10,211 --> 00:06:14,356
Right‐mii...! If this keeps up we
might not be totally doomed after all!

103
00:06:14,381 --> 00:06:15,725
Yeah!

104
00:06:17,937 --> 00:06:18,838
Lord Moffle?

105
00:06:20,223 --> 00:06:22,396
Man, I better stop drinkin' so much, I'm gettin' fat!

106
00:06:22,436 --> 00:06:25,672
He's right. The guest count IS going up, but...

107
00:06:27,335 --> 00:06:28,045
I know.

108
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:31,461
At this rate, there's a chance that...

109
00:06:31,821 --> 00:06:32,739
Ahhh!

110
00:06:32,764 --> 00:06:34,660
Now THAT'S how you knock back
a cold one, Mac, you're a champ!

111
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:35,698
Sorry we're late!

112
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,466
Hey you guys.

113
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:38,915
Lay back!

114
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,029
Heyyy...

115
00:06:40,054 --> 00:06:42,053
I got a seat for ya...

116
00:06:42,078 --> 00:06:43,109
Just sit anywhere.

117
00:06:43,134 --> 00:06:43,696
Thanks.

118
00:06:43,721 --> 00:06:45,834
Takami, we got some more for ya!

119
00:06:45,859 --> 00:06:46,499
'Kay!

120
00:06:54,785 --> 00:06:55,761
They're perfect.

121
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,396
They're orange croquettes.

122
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,728
I added a little touch of marmalade.

123
00:07:00,317 --> 00:07:03,458
The tea croquettes are almost
done, so please try those too.

124
00:07:03,522 --> 00:07:04,499
Of course.

125
00:07:06,808 --> 00:07:12,857
You know, recently... whenever I open a window I can
hear guests and workers laughing all the way in here.

126
00:07:13,336 --> 00:07:14,312
That's lovely.

127
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:20,530
How has Sir Kanie been lately? He must be terribly busy.

128
00:07:20,997 --> 00:07:21,679
Yes...

129
00:07:22,493 --> 00:07:23,955
He's been working hard.

130
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:28,488
I understand.

131
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:30,098
Oh, Lady Isuzu...?

132
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:33,129
Would you take a few of these
croquettes to Sir Kanie for me?

133
00:07:33,993 --> 00:07:36,021
I'd like him to sample them as well.

134
00:07:37,863 --> 00:07:38,414
Right.

135
00:07:39,077 --> 00:07:40,903
Great. They're almost finished now...

136
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:42,073
You'll enjoy these...

137
00:07:42,098 --> 00:07:46,152
I made them with Earl... Grey...

138
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:49,851
Your Majesty!

139
00:07:54,219 --> 00:07:55,590
I'm alright...

140
00:07:55,653 --> 00:08:00,453
I'm just feeling a little... dizzy...
nothing more... please don't worry.

141
00:08:02,043 --> 00:08:04,111
Princess?! Princess!

142
00:08:13,706 --> 00:08:14,508
How is she?

143
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,737
She's getting some rest for now.

144
00:08:17,935 --> 00:08:18,601
That's good.

145
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:21,896
So what's wrong...?

146
00:08:22,225 --> 00:08:23,867
Does she have some kind of illness?

147
00:08:25,845 --> 00:08:28,048
Does she...? Tell me the truth.

148
00:08:28,543 --> 00:08:30,491
No... Don't worry about it.

149
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,928
She'll be fine when she's rested up.

150
00:08:34,953 --> 00:08:36,581
Hey...! Moffle!

151
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:42,578
You know what's going on here, don't you?

152
00:08:44,448 --> 00:08:45,566
Say something!

153
00:08:52,822 --> 00:08:55,743
Maple Land's residents can't live without Animus...

154
00:08:56,207 --> 00:09:00,159
...the feelings of fun and happiness
experienced by the people of this world.

155
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,184
You already told me all that.

156
00:09:04,713 --> 00:09:06,381
A long time ago...

157
00:09:07,623 --> 00:09:11,575
Maple Land fell under attack... by a fearsome dragon.

158
00:09:11,939 --> 00:09:12,696
A dragon...?

159
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,219
As in a dragon like Rubrum?

160
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:17,720
It was a lot bigger than Rubrum.

161
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:19,495
Oh...

162
00:09:21,006 --> 00:09:25,067
The army did everything they could, but
they were unable to defeat such an imposing foe.

163
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:29,584
That was when the King was visited by a sorcerer.

164
00:09:30,796 --> 00:09:36,248
He promised the King that he would slay the
dragon in exchange for the princess' hand in marriage.

165
00:09:37,514 --> 00:09:38,690
The king agreed.

166
00:09:41,116 --> 00:09:43,951
And so the sorcerer made quick work of the dragon.

167
00:09:48,544 --> 00:09:50,632
I'm guessing they didn't live happily ever after.

168
00:09:53,102 --> 00:09:55,702
The King didn't want to surrender his daughter's hand...

169
00:09:55,904 --> 00:09:58,454
so he sent the army to attack the sorcerer.

170
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:05,079
Wounded and filled with rage, the
sorcerer placed a curse upon the princess...

171
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:08,962
that slowly drained her Animus
supply just before he fell off a cliff.

172
00:10:12,806 --> 00:10:14,843
So she's... really cursed?

173
00:10:17,419 --> 00:10:20,624
There was only one way to save
the princess from certain death.

174
00:10:21,116 --> 00:10:26,924
She was sent to this world to recuperate because there's
an abundant amount of Animus here to keep her healthy.

175
00:10:30,557 --> 00:10:32,080
And that's what the park is for.

176
00:10:34,915 --> 00:10:35,802
Correct.

177
00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:39,708
Which means... if AmaBri has to shut down...!

178
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:46,605
She won't make it.

179
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:56,940
How do you feel?

180
00:10:58,066 --> 00:10:59,685
Sorry to make you worry.

181
00:11:00,343 --> 00:11:02,498
I'll be alright if I rest a little.

182
00:11:03,651 --> 00:11:04,477
Good to hear.

183
00:11:10,065 --> 00:11:13,569
I understand you heard about my condition from Lady Isuzu.

184
00:11:13,594 --> 00:11:14,298
Is that true?

185
00:11:15,078 --> 00:11:15,610
Yeah.

186
00:11:16,783 --> 00:11:18,698
I told everyone not to tell you...

187
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:21,909
I was afraid that you would be
worried about me if you knew it.

188
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:24,904
I'm so sorry.

189
00:11:29,171 --> 00:11:32,078
I'm sorry I kept it a secret, Sir Kanie.

190
00:11:34,521 --> 00:11:35,387
It's fine.

191
00:11:37,003 --> 00:11:39,136
How are things in the park these days?

192
00:11:40,153 --> 00:11:42,131
Everyone's working hard out there.

193
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:43,388
But uh...

194
00:11:43,413 --> 00:11:43,902
Hm?

195
00:11:44,157 --> 00:11:49,703
If something doesn't change... getting enough
visitors to stay open is probably... not possible.

196
00:11:50,951 --> 00:11:51,777
I see.

197
00:11:58,199 --> 00:11:59,210
What's with you?

198
00:11:59,410 --> 00:11:59,915
Hm?

199
00:12:00,676 --> 00:12:03,842
How can you possibly be calm at a time like this?!

200
00:12:03,893 --> 00:12:06,086
If AmaBri closes down, you're gonna...

201
00:12:10,887 --> 00:12:12,000
You have a point...

202
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:14,923
I know I probably won't be alive much longer.

203
00:12:15,296 --> 00:12:16,202
So why...?!

204
00:12:16,786 --> 00:12:18,493
But I refuse to give up hope...

205
00:12:19,056 --> 00:12:20,470
not yet.

206
00:12:22,004 --> 00:12:23,743
I told you it doesn't look good.

207
00:12:24,456 --> 00:12:27,557
What's the point of waiting for a
miracle that probably won't happen?

208
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:30,914
But a miracle already did happen.

209
00:12:31,727 --> 00:12:33,827
Just take a look at everyone in the park...

210
00:12:34,081 --> 00:12:37,643
Everything started changing when you came into our lives,

211
00:12:37,984 --> 00:12:38,559
Really?

212
00:12:39,089 --> 00:12:39,819
Yes!

213
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:42,424
You've filled our beloved park
with the smiles and laughter of...

214
00:12:42,475 --> 00:12:45,214
... so many happy visitors since you came to work here.

215
00:12:45,504 --> 00:12:47,595
I don't know if I would consider that a miracle.

216
00:12:47,876 --> 00:12:48,960
Sir Kanie...

217
00:12:49,543 --> 00:12:53,094
I realize it may not seem like
anything special in your eyes but...

218
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:55,545
...to me, what you've done for us...

219
00:12:56,205 --> 00:12:57,893
it means the whole world!

220
00:13:02,798 --> 00:13:05,727
Yeah but... you're still in serious trouble and...

221
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:17,523
Sir Kanie?

222
00:13:18,288 --> 00:13:19,647
Is everything alright?

223
00:13:23,714 --> 00:13:24,542
Latifah.

224
00:13:26,735 --> 00:13:28,466
Are you really okay with this?

225
00:13:31,897 --> 00:13:32,566
Yes.

226
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:34,391
Are you sure?

227
00:13:37,978 --> 00:13:39,259
Certainly.

228
00:13:45,103 --> 00:13:45,908
Okay then.

229
00:13:52,011 --> 00:13:53,644
These ideas all suck!

230
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:58,113
B‐but the visitor count's been getting
better since we started working at night.

231
00:13:58,138 --> 00:13:59,355
So if we stretch it to 24 hours then...

232
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,847
Yeah maybe in the long term...

233
00:14:00,872 --> 00:14:03,753
But that won't make enough of a
difference before the deadline!

234
00:14:03,784 --> 00:14:05,895
Unless you can give me a clear guarantee!

235
00:14:06,397 --> 00:14:07,686
W‐well uh...

236
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,436
And promoting outside the park?

237
00:14:09,852 --> 00:14:11,116
It's good publicity.

238
00:14:11,294 --> 00:14:14,606
Advertising takes way too long
to bring in actual results...!

239
00:14:14,631 --> 00:14:16,490
We don't have time for stuff like that!

240
00:14:16,515 --> 00:14:19,891
For right now, we have to do whatever
it takes to get that visitor count up!

241
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:21,054
And you guys!

242
00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:23,091
The 0 yen campaign!

243
00:14:23,194 --> 00:14:26,145
That's no different from the
30 yen push we're doing NOW...!

244
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:27,980
It won't give us enough of a boost!

245
00:14:29,659 --> 00:14:32,116
You're right; I'm sorry that's a dumb idea...

246
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,983
It's almost July 31st...

247
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:39,976
What this park needs right now is a solid
idea that'll guarantee 134,000 guests before then.

248
00:14:40,001 --> 00:14:41,450
Come up with something better!

249
00:14:42,331 --> 00:14:43,632
He was outta line!

250
00:14:43,657 --> 00:14:46,812
It wasn't nice of him to yell
at us when we're trying to help!

251
00:14:46,837 --> 00:14:48,750
Yeah that was #rude.

252
00:14:48,775 --> 00:14:49,790
Calm down, you guys...

253
00:14:49,815 --> 00:14:52,409
I don't know. Maybe something's been bothering him.

254
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,785
He's just aggro over the deadline.

255
00:14:58,463 --> 00:15:01,014
The classic boy‐in‐a desperate‐situation scenario!

256
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:02,209
Oooooh... Aaaahhhh...

257
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,514
We should pair him with a guy who's more experienced!

258
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:06,993
It's not a boy-love manga...

259
00:15:07,267 --> 00:15:08,377
Let's get going.

260
00:15:56,932 --> 00:15:59,296
You're making a lot of enemies lately.

261
00:15:59,379 --> 00:16:00,281
I know!

262
00:16:00,609 --> 00:16:04,664
But if I don't pull out all the stops, we're
not gonna sell enough tickets before the deadline.

263
00:16:04,752 --> 00:16:07,109
Gettin' all moffin' mad won't help.

264
00:16:07,677 --> 00:16:09,763
Everybody's trying their hardest.

265
00:16:11,249 --> 00:16:12,947
I don't need you to tell me that.

266
00:16:13,849 --> 00:16:17,347
But if we don't have something to show
for it, they might as well be doing nothing!

267
00:16:18,235 --> 00:16:20,202
What happened to what you said before?

268
00:16:20,262 --> 00:16:23,217
"Whatever it takes to get even one more guest"?

269
00:16:23,757 --> 00:16:24,551
You're right...

270
00:16:24,861 --> 00:16:27,538
That kinda crap is why we're about to fail here!

271
00:16:27,563 --> 00:16:28,715
Moff!

272
00:16:29,331 --> 00:16:30,339
Lord Moffle!

273
00:16:31,405 --> 00:16:35,081
Even if AmaBri closes down, the
cast members can find another job.

274
00:16:37,911 --> 00:16:39,709
But Latifah's not so lucky.

275
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,711
You told him, didn't you?

276
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:47,023
Yes.

277
00:17:04,763 --> 00:17:06,047
I'm exhausted.

278
00:17:07,205 --> 00:17:08,490
Working too hard, huh?

279
00:17:09,588 --> 00:17:10,822
Something like that.

280
00:17:15,143 --> 00:17:16,256
Ahhh...

281
00:17:16,764 --> 00:17:17,759
Hey Aunt Aisu?

282
00:17:18,006 --> 00:17:18,697
Yeah?

283
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:21,076
Being a magazine editor...

284
00:17:21,223 --> 00:17:22,146
is it hard?

285
00:17:22,223 --> 00:17:23,318
Not really.

286
00:17:23,974 --> 00:17:26,973
Except when the manuscripts are
late and the printers get pissed.

287
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:29,484
And sometimes authors straight‐up run from us.

288
00:17:30,411 --> 00:17:31,156
So uh...

289
00:17:31,738 --> 00:17:33,809
whenever something goes wrong at work...

290
00:17:33,908 --> 00:17:35,375
is there anything you can do about it?

291
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:37,036
Grab a beer and forget it!

292
00:17:37,528 --> 00:17:38,255
What?!

293
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:45,709
Now, have a safe summer break and set the best example
you can for your fellow students, okay? You're excused.

294
00:17:46,053 --> 00:17:47,654
Don't forget your books!

295
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:08,940
You're 10 years too young to
be lookin' this depressed, Kid.

296
00:18:13,428 --> 00:18:14,442
What's this about?

297
00:18:14,695 --> 00:18:16,031
Don't worry about it.

298
00:18:22,295 --> 00:18:23,464
That'll cost ya.

299
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,219
You expect me to pay?!

300
00:18:25,284 --> 00:18:26,641
Just moffin' ya.

301
00:18:30,432 --> 00:18:32,548
I really can't stand you. You know that?

302
00:18:33,146 --> 00:18:34,346
Right back atcha.

303
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:37,321
I don't get it.

304
00:18:37,728 --> 00:18:38,581
What do you mean?

305
00:18:39,072 --> 00:18:41,520
Why are you so desperate to fix this?

306
00:18:43,056 --> 00:18:44,873
I met Latifah a long time ago.

307
00:18:45,101 --> 00:18:45,975
Moff?

308
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:47,227
When I was a kid.

309
00:18:47,654 --> 00:18:49,675
I wandered into the garden by mistake...

310
00:18:50,826 --> 00:18:52,270
She was sitting there crying.

311
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:58,770
When I asked her what was wrong, she told
me some story about a sorcerer's curse...

312
00:18:59,727 --> 00:19:01,295
and how she was really lonely.

313
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:03,372
She told you?

314
00:19:03,487 --> 00:19:04,235
Yeah.

315
00:19:04,665 --> 00:19:08,966
I wanted her to stop crying so I showed her
my impression of the legendary Prince Shotoku...

316
00:19:08,991 --> 00:19:10,630
What?! I wanna see!

317
00:19:10,655 --> 00:19:11,558
Not now.

318
00:19:12,369 --> 00:19:13,394
What's your problem?

319
00:19:14,246 --> 00:19:18,035
As I was saying, I was so desperate
to put a smile on her face that day.

320
00:19:18,439 --> 00:19:19,352
But I failed.

321
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:20,949
You failed?

322
00:19:21,795 --> 00:19:24,161
Well, she did smile when she saw my impression...

323
00:19:25,358 --> 00:19:26,624
...but it was a sad smile.

324
00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:31,687
Like she was just trying to make me feel better.

325
00:19:33,277 --> 00:19:35,527
That's the kind of person she is.

326
00:19:35,552 --> 00:19:36,749
When I saw that...

327
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:40,120
I promised Latifah that I would find a way to save her.

328
00:19:46,193 --> 00:19:47,275
Come to think of it...

329
00:19:47,497 --> 00:19:51,750
I was noticing that she looks exactly the same as
she did when I first met her all those years ago.

330
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:54,915
Do the people of Maple Land just not age or something?

331
00:19:56,324 --> 00:19:58,366
Latifah's a special case.

332
00:20:01,209 --> 00:20:03,669
That curse does more than make her weak.

333
00:20:05,414 --> 00:20:09,429
Every year, it erases a whole year's
worth of memories and physical growth,

334
00:20:09,545 --> 00:20:11,432
which makes her eternally young.

335
00:20:12,624 --> 00:20:13,282
Wha...?

336
00:20:13,511 --> 00:20:17,792
For more than a decade now, she's
been living as a 14‐year‐old girl.

337
00:20:21,505 --> 00:20:24,252
So that's why her looks haven't changed since we met.

338
00:20:25,219 --> 00:20:26,208
That's right.

339
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:29,946
August 1st is the anniversary of Latifah's curse.

340
00:20:30,639 --> 00:20:33,607
And when that day gets here, she'll forget you too.

341
00:20:41,011 --> 00:20:44,111
Who cares... if she forgets me?

342
00:20:44,216 --> 00:20:45,059
Moff?

343
00:20:45,262 --> 00:20:46,888
This is my problem to solve.

344
00:20:47,207 --> 00:20:51,211
After I was lucky enough to be given
another chance to make Latifah smile.

345
00:20:51,236 --> 00:20:52,579
I can't fail her again.

346
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:55,366
Wait and see... I can do this!

347
00:20:57,785 --> 00:20:59,022
Moff...

348
00:20:59,898 --> 00:21:01,926
Why do YOU care so much about Latifah?

349
00:21:03,339 --> 00:21:05,760
Because Latifah's my niece, of course.

350
00:21:06,444 --> 00:21:07,709
Like, by blood?!

351
00:21:08,107 --> 00:21:09,237
Yeah. What about it?

352
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,304
Never mind.

353
00:21:12,185 --> 00:21:13,351
Not long ago...

354
00:21:13,431 --> 00:21:17,499
the plan was to take her with me when the
park closed down and become a street performer.

355
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:21,227
I figured a simple life like that wouldn't be so bad.

356
00:21:22,622 --> 00:21:24,681
Even if it couldn't last for long.

357
00:21:25,767 --> 00:21:27,092
I'd accepted it.

358
00:21:28,627 --> 00:21:30,919
But when you showed up, you changed my mind.

359
00:21:31,372 --> 00:21:32,904
Even if we go down...

360
00:21:33,931 --> 00:21:36,533
I want to fight to the moffin' end.

361
00:21:37,849 --> 00:21:39,113
What are you gonna do?

362
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:55,007
Right!

363
00:21:58,726 --> 00:21:59,878
I found one...!

364
00:21:59,955 --> 00:22:02,008
I did it, Mr. Kanie!

365
00:22:02,064 --> 00:22:04,671
We just might reach our goal after all!

366
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:46,504
Time for the attractions spotlight.

367
00:23:46,928 --> 00:23:49,715
Today we have Rubrum's Chamber of Trials.

368
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:51,307
We've been to this one before.

369
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:54,288
I'm glad to see it's getting more popular these days.

370
00:23:54,483 --> 00:23:57,494
The traps we fell into the first time are still intact.

371
00:23:57,711 --> 00:24:00,174
Rubrum's excited to have more work to do as well.

372
00:24:00,228 --> 00:24:01,809
Are the prison cells still there?

373
00:24:01,874 --> 00:24:07,333
Yes. I hear the hospitality's so good that some
visitors refuse to leave at the end of the day.

374
00:24:07,429 --> 00:24:09,134
It's not a hotel!
