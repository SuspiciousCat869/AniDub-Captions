That's right.

[SHIRASAWA] I am Shirasawa,
the elder of this village.

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.120
It was I who summoned
for your assistance.

00:03:24.705 --> 00:03:28.208
As you can see, this is a
humble and isolated place.

Our village is shadowed at the

Those mountains keep
this a very quiet place.

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.968
On snowy nights like this one,

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:42.472
words and whispers, and
even the wind can disappear.

00:03:42.514 --> 00:03:45.100
It is at times like this
when some villagers

00:03:45.142 --> 00:03:47.436

Hmm.

For the most part, no.
It's usually just one.

I've seen these symptoms before.

00:04:13.962 --> 00:04:16.256
This mucus...

00:04:16.298 --> 00:04:19.926
It's an infection...
caused by <i>mushi.</i>

00:04:19.968 --> 00:04:21.303
What's that?

00:04:21.344 --> 00:04:23.054
[GINKO]
They're called <i>"un."</i>

00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:27.267
They're a type of <i>mushi</i>
that consumes sound.

00:04:27.309 --> 00:04:28.852
They normally dwell in forests

00:04:28.894 --> 00:04:31.021
and subsist on
the sound there.

00:04:31.062 --> 00:04:34.483
But in winter, the snow
absorbs most sound.

00:04:34.524 --> 00:04:36.193
That leaves them hungry.

00:04:36.234 --> 00:04:38.445
They've come here
looking for food.

00:04:44.493 --> 00:04:48.121
Ah... Now what do we have here?

00:04:48.163 --> 00:04:50.874
Quite a sizeable colony
has built a nest.

00:04:50.916 --> 00:04:54.169
They're competing for every
morsel of sound to be had.

00:04:58.632 --> 00:04:59.841
But if there isn't enough,

00:04:59.883 --> 00:05:03.887
Some will leave the nest to look
for a home in a living host.

00:05:14.356 --> 00:05:16.441
[GINKO] Did you know that
you have an organ in each ear

that looks just like a snail?

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.403
It looks inviting
to a hungry <i>un,</i>

00:05:20.445 --> 00:05:24.241
so it abandons its old shell and
adopts the organ as its new one.

00:05:24.282 --> 00:05:26.827
Then it eats all
the incoming sound.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.910
If one is infected with the <i>ah,</i>

00:08:13.952 --> 00:08:16.371
they lose the ability to make
out sounds close to them.

drowns out normal hearing.

Mostly. In my opinion.

We humans have
pretty bad hearing.

But animals?

00:10:06.314 --> 00:10:08.608
Their hearing is
much more sensitive.

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:11.736
They can hear noises that
we would never notice.

But... there is a spectrum
of sound so minute

that even the
animals can't hear.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.911
That's the voices of the <i>mushi.</i>

00:10:19.953 --> 00:10:22.122
Huh, really?
They don't sound quiet.

00:10:22.163 --> 00:10:24.332
They're pretty loud
if you ask me.

[GINKO]
Actually, they're not.

00:10:26.042 --> 00:10:29.045
Individually, <i>mushi</i>
make very little noise.

Even though their size and
their sound might be small,

they create a big noise when
they all start talking together.

00:10:40.431 --> 00:10:43.643
That noise builds in
volume, like an echo,

I remembered that one day

00:11:28.104 --> 00:11:30.690
and decided to try
it out for myself.

00:11:30.732 --> 00:11:32.567
So I did it.

00:11:32.609 --> 00:11:34.611
That's when it happened.

00:11:34.652 --> 00:11:38.031
The horns grew out of
my head all of a sudden.

00:11:38.072 --> 00:11:40.700
Your mother would...
cover her ears?

00:11:42.202 --> 00:11:44.287
[GINKO]
Why did she do that?

00:11:44.329 --> 00:11:46.414
I don't really know.

00:11:46.456 --> 00:11:48.625
I can't remember why she did it.

00:11:48.666 --> 00:11:51.377
Mother suffered from the
same sickness I have.

00:11:51.419 --> 00:11:53.213
She had horns as well.

00:11:53.254 --> 00:11:55.340
So even if she covered her ears,

00:11:55.381 --> 00:11:59.010
she wouldn't have been able
to shut out the noises.

00:11:59.052 --> 00:12:03.139
Shortly before Mother died,
she tried to tell me something.

00:12:05.725 --> 00:12:08.061
[MAHO] She was really
weak at that point,

00:12:08.102 --> 00:12:10.688
but somehow Mother managed
to raise both of her hands

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:13.233
and cover my ears with them.

00:12:13.274 --> 00:12:14.651
I wish...

00:12:14.692 --> 00:12:17.695
I wish I could remember
what she said.

00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:20.073
I try really hard to remember...

00:12:20.114 --> 00:12:22.784
...and sometimes
I think I almost do.

00:12:23.993 --> 00:12:25.870
[MAHO] But then those
other noises in my head

00:12:25.912 --> 00:12:28.414
come rushing in and
I can't hear her...

00:12:28.456 --> 00:12:30.750
[sobs]

00:12:30.792 --> 00:12:32.126
[GINKO]
I see...

00:12:34.087 --> 00:12:36.547
[GINKO]
I do feel sorry for the boy.

00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:38.925
The only good thing is that
we've discovered a connection

00:12:38.967 --> 00:12:41.469
between his sickness
and that of his mother.

00:12:41.511 --> 00:12:43.012
But a cure?

00:12:43.054 --> 00:12:45.098
That's going to be the
real challenge, isn't it?

00:12:53.439 --> 00:12:56.818
[SHIRASAWA] Oh, my dear,
sweet daughter, Matsu...

00:12:58.069 --> 00:13:01.406
[SHIRASAWA] It broke my
heart, watching her suffer.

00:13:01.447 --> 00:13:04.284
With that constant
noise tormenting her,

00:13:04.325 --> 00:13:06.661
she was unable to sleep.

00:13:06.703 --> 00:13:09.497
She'd never say it
in front of Maho...

00:13:10.915 --> 00:13:13.584
...but she would
constantly tell me:

00:13:13.626 --> 00:13:16.671
[MATSU] All I want to
do is sleep peacefully,

00:13:16.713 --> 00:13:20.049
in a place where no
sound will intrude...

00:13:20.091 --> 00:13:22.510
It was just as in the
case you mentioned.

00:13:22.552 --> 00:13:26.014
She held on through the end
of the following winter.

00:13:26.055 --> 00:13:30.143
Then she finally went to that
place for which she so longed.

00:13:30.184 --> 00:13:31.644
Did her condition ever change,

00:13:31.686 --> 00:13:33.730
or did she suffer
to the very end?

00:13:33.771 --> 00:13:35.940
[SHIRASAWA]
It never changed.

00:13:35.982 --> 00:13:37.483
Wait...

00:13:37.525 --> 00:13:39.402
No, now that I think about it...

00:13:39.444 --> 00:13:40.528
Near the end,

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:43.740
Matsu looked up at me and
said something strange.

00:13:44.741 --> 00:13:46.868
[MATSU]
Mother, the noises!

00:13:46.909 --> 00:13:48.578
They've gone away!

00:13:48.619 --> 00:13:50.872
I can't hear a thing!

00:13:50.913 --> 00:13:53.791
Absolutely nothing...

00:13:53.833 --> 00:13:55.877
I'm frightened!

00:13:55.918 --> 00:13:57.628
Now that they're gone, I...

00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:00.298
...actually miss
those awful sounds!

00:14:02.675 --> 00:14:05.636
After that, she claimed
all sound faded.

00:14:05.678 --> 00:14:07.555
So did her spirit.

00:14:07.597 --> 00:14:09.682
It was such a tragic loss.

00:14:09.724 --> 00:14:11.267
So if I understand
you correctly,

00:14:11.309 --> 00:14:12.769
your daughter couldn't
hear anything at all

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:14.812
right before she passed away?

00:14:14.854 --> 00:14:16.606
[SHIRASAWA]
Yes. That's right.

00:14:16.647 --> 00:14:18.399
Is there anything else?

00:14:18.441 --> 00:14:21.152
[SHIRASAWA] No, just
the story Maho told you.

00:14:21.194 --> 00:14:22.528
It was this time last year

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:24.822
when Matsu put her
hands over his ears.

00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:25.907
I paid it little mind,

00:14:25.948 --> 00:14:29.077
but I remember thinking
it was strange.

00:14:29.118 --> 00:14:32.622
Just what would possess my
daughter to do such a thing?

00:14:34.791 --> 00:14:38.044
[GINKO] So she couldn't hear
anything right before she died.

00:14:38.086 --> 00:14:39.879
Did the <i>ah</i> know she was dying

00:14:39.921 --> 00:14:43.049
and leave her body
before she expired?

00:14:43.091 --> 00:14:44.342
No...

00:14:44.384 --> 00:14:47.720
If that were so, her hearing
would have been restored.

00:14:47.762 --> 00:14:50.014
Why wasn't she able
to hear anything?

00:14:51.682 --> 00:14:53.518
[GINKO]
And if she couldn't hear...

00:14:53.559 --> 00:14:55.728
...why would she bother
to cover her ears?

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:57.230
[door slides]

00:14:59.107 --> 00:15:01.359
[GINKO]
Where do you think you're going?

00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:03.736
Oh, wait... he can't hear me.

00:15:03.778 --> 00:15:05.405
[MAHO yelps]

00:15:05.446 --> 00:15:07.907
Uh...

00:15:07.949 --> 00:15:09.492
Please don't tell.

00:15:09.534 --> 00:15:13.371
I'm just going out for--
for a little walk.

00:15:13.413 --> 00:15:15.623
Don't tell Grandmother, okay?

00:15:15.665 --> 00:15:17.208
I have to get outside.

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:19.293
If I stay cooped up
in the house any longer,

00:15:19.335 --> 00:15:21.921
I think I'll go crazy...!

00:15:21.963 --> 00:15:25.216
I... I just...

00:15:25.258 --> 00:15:26.634
[sighs]

00:15:26.676 --> 00:15:27.718
...keep thinking...

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.930
...about my mother and
the sickness that killed her.

00:15:30.972 --> 00:15:33.099
Will it kill me, as well?

00:15:39.105 --> 00:15:41.524
[GINKO]
I don't blame him...

00:15:41.566 --> 00:15:43.025
After all he's been through,

00:15:43.067 --> 00:15:46.612
I'd be asking the same question
if I were in his place.

00:15:53.578 --> 00:15:55.455
[GINKO]
Snowing again...

00:15:55.496 --> 00:15:57.373
Maybe I shouldn't
have let him go.

00:15:57.415 --> 00:16:00.293
[SHIRASAWA]
Maho? Maho?

00:16:00.334 --> 00:16:04.255
Oh! I'm sorry, sir.
Have you seen Maho anywhere?

00:16:04.297 --> 00:16:05.423
[GINKO]
Don't worry.

00:16:05.465 --> 00:16:06.924
I saw the direction
he was heading.

00:16:06.966 --> 00:16:07.925
[SHIRASAWA gasps]

00:16:07.967 --> 00:16:09.719
Why did you let him leave?!

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:11.095
[GINKO]
I'll find him.

00:16:11.137 --> 00:16:12.472
Trust me.

00:16:16.893 --> 00:16:18.352
[GINKO]
It's quiet...

00:16:21.898 --> 00:16:26.402
[GINKO] However, sound
is not totally absent.

00:16:26.444 --> 00:16:27.862
Though it might be faint,

00:16:27.904 --> 00:16:30.698
even falling snow
creates a sound.

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:32.825
Nothing is ever truly silent.

00:16:32.867 --> 00:16:34.368
If it's quiet enough,

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:36.871
you can even hear the
beating of your heart.

00:16:38.623 --> 00:16:39.540
[GINKO]
But...

00:16:39.582 --> 00:16:42.668
Maho is unable to hear
natural sounds like that.

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:45.671
He can only hear the
sounds of faraway <i>mushi.</i>

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:48.841
[GINKO]
And if that imbalance

00:16:48.883 --> 00:16:51.469
grew worse and
worse over time...

00:16:51.511 --> 00:16:53.888
Perhaps...

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:55.556
Just perhaps...

00:16:55.598 --> 00:16:59.101
...it could make all sound
disappear and fade away.

00:17:00.102 --> 00:17:02.188
[GINKO]
Now I get it.

00:17:04.774 --> 00:17:05.775
[GINKO]
Hm?

00:17:07.151 --> 00:17:11.489
--[footsteps crunching]
--[fire crackling]

00:17:13.157 --> 00:17:14.534
[MAHO gasps]

00:17:14.575 --> 00:17:15.701
[sighs]

00:17:15.743 --> 00:17:17.954
[MAHO] I'm sorry you had
to come looking for me.

00:17:17.995 --> 00:17:21.374
I didn't plan to stay gone
for so long, I swear.

00:17:21.415 --> 00:17:24.585
But it started snowing
really hard outside,

00:17:24.627 --> 00:17:28.839
so I came here... to wait
it out until it slowed down.

00:17:28.881 --> 00:17:29.799
It didn't...

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:33.010
It just kept coming down
harder and harder...

00:17:33.052 --> 00:17:35.471
[GINKO]
What's happening to his voice?!

00:17:50.194 --> 00:17:51.404
[MAHO gasps]

00:17:53.239 --> 00:17:54.865
[GINKO]
Easy there...

00:17:54.907 --> 00:17:57.743
Stop fighting over me, okay?

00:17:57.785 --> 00:18:00.121
Now which one of you is <i>ah?</i>

00:18:00.162 --> 00:18:03.708
<i>Un</i> is coiled clockwise...
<i>Ah</i> counterclockwise...

00:18:03.749 --> 00:18:05.042
So...

00:18:05.084 --> 00:18:06.377
There you are.

00:18:13.426 --> 00:18:14.635
[MAHO gasps]

00:18:23.269 --> 00:18:24.437
[GINKO]
Hey, Maho...

00:18:24.478 --> 00:18:27.398
It's okay. Give me your hands.

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:30.234
Put them on my ears
just like your mother did.

00:18:38.576 --> 00:18:41.078
[muffled rumbling]

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:42.163
[MAHO]
Like this?

00:18:42.204 --> 00:18:48.586
[thumping]

00:18:48.628 --> 00:18:50.379
[rumbling, pop]

00:18:53.215 --> 00:18:54.759
It dissolved!

00:18:56.886 --> 00:18:58.471
[GINKO]
Even if you cover your ears,

00:18:58.512 --> 00:19:00.723
you can't extinguish all sound.

00:19:01.974 --> 00:19:03.976
[GINKO] It must have appeared as
if your daughter was trying to

00:19:04.018 --> 00:19:06.937
shut out any noise
before she died.

00:19:06.979 --> 00:19:08.606
But on the contrary,

00:19:08.648 --> 00:19:12.026
she was trying to listen to
a sound she wanted to hear.

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:16.447
[GINKO]
Do you hear it?

00:19:16.489 --> 00:19:17.907
[SHIRASAWA]
Yes...

00:19:17.948 --> 00:19:20.868
It's like a small rumbling.

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:21.744
Exactly.

00:19:21.786 --> 00:19:22.787
What you're hearing is the sound

00:19:22.828 --> 00:19:25.539
of the muscles in
your wrists moving.

00:19:25.581 --> 00:19:27.375
The <i>ah</i> feed on silence,

00:19:27.416 --> 00:19:30.002
so noise is its
natural weakness.

00:19:30.044 --> 00:19:31.921
As you just heard for yourself,

00:19:31.962 --> 00:19:34.965
the body is always
making constant noise.

00:19:35.007 --> 00:19:38.094
Therefore, if the <i>ah</i>
burrowed into a living host,

00:19:38.135 --> 00:19:41.180
it would be a very
uncomfortable and noisy home.

00:19:41.222 --> 00:19:44.308
That's what the <i>ah</i>
is trying to do--

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:45.768
Erase the body's sound.

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:49.480
If it fails, it will
dissolve or leave.

00:19:49.522 --> 00:19:52.775
If it's successful, the <i>ah</i> takes
its toll on the host's body,

00:19:52.817 --> 00:19:55.361
which dies from depression.

00:19:55.403 --> 00:19:58.823
This struggle between
<i>ah</i> and host takes a year.

00:19:58.864 --> 00:20:00.116
I have the feeling your daughter

00:20:00.157 --> 00:20:03.494
probably realized
this towards the end.

00:20:03.536 --> 00:20:07.039
But at that point,
she was too weak.

00:20:07.081 --> 00:20:08.791
[MATSU]
Maho...

00:20:09.959 --> 00:20:13.629
[MATSU] Can you hear it?
This is my sound.

00:20:13.671 --> 00:20:15.506
[low rumbling]

00:20:15.548 --> 00:20:17.258
Long ago...

00:20:17.299 --> 00:20:20.136
Your father and I journeyed.

00:20:20.177 --> 00:20:22.471
We saw a mountain...

00:20:22.513 --> 00:20:24.640
...and it spewed fire.

00:20:24.682 --> 00:20:28.269
My sound is exactly
like that of the lava

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:30.688
flowing from the mountain.

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:34.525
[MATSU]
That's why...

00:20:34.567 --> 00:20:36.986
...when I'm overwhelmed
by the other sounds so much

00:20:37.027 --> 00:20:39.071
I want to disappear...

00:20:39.113 --> 00:20:41.866
I listen for my sound.

00:20:41.907 --> 00:20:46.328
The sound of lava, which
can melt anything...

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:48.622
Nothing can withstand it.

00:20:48.664 --> 00:20:55.045
It can melt fear, sadness,
all of the bad things in life.

00:20:55.087 --> 00:20:56.714
Come now...

00:20:56.756 --> 00:20:58.841
You must listen.

00:20:58.883 --> 00:21:01.677
The lava flows within
you as well, Maho.

00:21:01.719 --> 00:21:03.596
[rumbling continues]

00:21:13.731 --> 00:21:14.899
[SHIRASAWA gasps]

00:21:16.859 --> 00:21:18.444
[MAHO]
The lava...

00:21:18.486 --> 00:21:19.695
[SHIRASAWA]
Maho...?

00:21:21.447 --> 00:21:25.159
[MAHO]
Mother was right about the lava.

00:21:25.201 --> 00:21:27.286
It's flowing...

00:21:31.624 --> 00:21:35.836
[GINKO] Now as for the matter
of my fee, these will suffice.

00:21:35.878 --> 00:21:39.465
[SHIRASAWA] Is... Is that
adequate compensation?

00:21:39.507 --> 00:21:40.925
[GINKO]
That it is.

00:21:40.966 --> 00:21:43.552
Is that all right
with you, Maho?

00:21:43.594 --> 00:21:44.804
[MAHO]
Hm.

00:21:54.355 --> 00:21:55.356
[MAHO]
Huh?

00:21:59.568 --> 00:22:00.986
[MAHO]
Huh...?

00:22:01.028 --> 00:22:04.782
[GINKO] Maho, the world can
be a pretty quiet place,

00:22:04.824 --> 00:22:06.534
especially in winter.

00:22:06.575 --> 00:22:08.619
It's going to take
some getting used to,

00:22:08.661 --> 00:22:12.081
and you may even miss the
old sounds you used to hear.

00:22:12.122 --> 00:22:13.415
But just wait...

00:22:13.457 --> 00:22:15.209
With spring comes
the sounds of life

00:22:15.251 --> 00:22:17.545
and you'll forget those
old sounds in time.

00:22:19.046 --> 00:22:20.548
I don't think...

00:22:20.589 --> 00:22:22.424
I'll ever forget it.

00:22:24.009 --> 00:22:27.388
[MAHO] I've listened
to it for so long...

00:22:27.429 --> 00:22:30.182
...the same sound Mother heard.

00:22:30.224 --> 00:22:33.477
It's actually very pretty.

00:22:33.519 --> 00:22:35.938
It gives me the chills...

00:23:48.469 --> 00:23:51.513
