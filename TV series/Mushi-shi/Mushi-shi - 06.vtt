00:12:27.205 --> 00:12:28.456
[GINKO]
There it is.

00:12:43.846 --> 00:12:45.265
[NAGI]
Akoya?

00:12:48.393 --> 00:12:50.478
Na... gi?

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.230
Akoya!

00:12:52.272 --> 00:12:55.733
It's you! It's really you.

00:13:03.199 --> 00:13:06.369
But... Why would Father do that?

00:13:06.411 --> 00:13:09.122
Akoya. Let's run away.

00:13:09.163 --> 00:13:11.874
The next spring tide
comes in three days.

00:13:11.916 --> 00:13:13.626
You must keep the fact
that you've been healed

00:13:13.668 --> 00:13:16.838
a secret until we
can leave this island.

00:13:16.879 --> 00:13:20.675
But I love it here.
This is my home.

00:13:20.717 --> 00:13:25.388
I'm sure that Father will be
sorry for the things he did.

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:28.057
If I leave,
someone else will end up

00:13:28.099 --> 00:13:30.476
having to become the Living God.

00:13:30.518 --> 00:13:32.729
Then you should
reveal what causes this.

00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:37.358
to stop the abuse of this
island's <i>mushi</i> and its people.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.653
Do you remember the day
you became the Living God?

00:13:40.695 --> 00:13:41.863
Yes, I do.

00:13:41.904 --> 00:13:43.948
My Father had summoned me.

00:13:45.533 --> 00:13:46.659
[AKOYA'S FATHER]
Akoya!

00:13:46.701 --> 00:13:50.079
I picked this special
flower just for you!

00:13:54.542 --> 00:13:56.878
[AKOYA]
It's beautiful!

00:13:56.919 --> 00:13:59.130
[AKOYA'S FATHER]
And it smells wonderful!

00:13:59.172 --> 00:14:01.632
Go ahead! Try it!

00:14:06.262 --> 00:14:07.930
It had a strong scent?

00:14:07.972 --> 00:14:10.266
And it looked
like a morning glory?

00:14:10.308 --> 00:14:12.810
I've seen flowers
like that in the cave.

00:14:12.852 --> 00:14:15.521
They were blooming in the dark.

00:14:15.563 --> 00:14:17.982
Is that the cause?

00:14:18.024 --> 00:14:20.151
Three days, right?

00:14:20.193 --> 00:14:21.069
Akoya.

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:24.405
We have to make sure your father
doesn't notice a change in you.

00:14:24.447 --> 00:14:28.076
Just keep pretending you're
the Living God until then.

00:14:28.117 --> 00:14:32.663
[VILLAGERS whispering]

00:14:44.425 --> 00:14:45.343
[GINKO]
What's wrong?

00:14:45.385 --> 00:14:47.387
Still not feeling like yourself?

00:14:51.641 --> 00:14:54.852
[AKOYA]
I feel anxious. Uneasy.

00:14:54.894 --> 00:14:56.479
When I was the Living God,

00:14:56.521 --> 00:14:59.565
after the sun would set
and I'd begin to age,

00:14:59.607 --> 00:15:01.651
I could always close
my eyes with a feeling

00:15:01.692 --> 00:15:03.778
of great satisfaction.

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:06.322
It was comforting, somehow.

00:15:06.364 --> 00:15:09.075
But now, I'm frightened.

00:15:09.117 --> 00:15:10.535
When I wake up,

00:15:10.576 --> 00:15:12.703
all that awaits me
is the continuation

00:15:12.745 --> 00:15:15.540
of the previous day.

00:15:15.581 --> 00:15:18.209
I feel overpowered
by the uncertainty

00:15:18.251 --> 00:15:20.795
of everything that
lies in front of me.

00:15:22.755 --> 00:15:23.673
Perhaps...

00:15:23.714 --> 00:15:25.967
You were living in
the <i>mushi</i>'s frame of time.

00:15:27.885 --> 00:15:31.347
This particular <i>mushi</i> harmonizes
its host's biological clock

00:15:31.389 --> 00:15:33.391
with its own.

00:15:33.433 --> 00:15:36.269
All living things have
a different life span.

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:38.521
Even so, it's said that
the number of heartbeats

00:15:38.563 --> 00:15:40.773
each being makes is the same.

00:15:40.815 --> 00:15:44.527
In other words, the density of
time runs at different rates.

00:15:44.569 --> 00:15:47.280
This <i>mushi</i>'s life span
was just one day.

00:15:47.321 --> 00:15:52.034
You experienced the entirety
of its life every single day.

00:15:52.076 --> 00:15:54.996
So... Maybe
that's the reason...

00:15:59.792 --> 00:16:04.255
[AKOYA] Day after day,
and hour after hour...

00:16:04.297 --> 00:16:08.342
I felt fresh and new
with every breath.

00:16:08.384 --> 00:16:12.513
When I tried to think,
I couldn't keep up.

00:16:19.604 --> 00:16:23.399
But I was always content.

00:16:23.441 --> 00:16:26.527
My heart felt fulfilled
and full of life.

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:35.203
[NAGI] In another hour,
we'll be able to go in.

00:16:40.625 --> 00:16:41.250
Akoya...

00:16:41.292 --> 00:16:42.210
[AKOYA gasps]

00:16:42.251 --> 00:16:44.253
It's odd that I
should find you like this.

00:16:44.295 --> 00:16:47.381
I would have expected you
to be old and weak by this hour.

00:16:47.423 --> 00:16:49.300
[AKOYA]
Father, it's strange.

00:16:49.342 --> 00:16:51.052
I'm not exactly sure
how it happened,

00:16:51.093 --> 00:16:52.970
but I've been cured somehow.

00:16:53.012 --> 00:16:54.055
Silence!

00:16:54.096 --> 00:16:57.350
I've heard that Nagi
has returned to the island.

00:16:57.391 --> 00:16:59.852
You know where
he went, don't you?

00:17:01.771 --> 00:17:03.648
[AKOYA'S FATHER]
Ah, yes!

00:17:03.689 --> 00:17:05.733
Today is the spring tide.

00:17:18.037 --> 00:17:19.580
Growing in the darkness.

00:17:19.622 --> 00:17:21.332
Their scent is strong.

00:17:22.291 --> 00:17:24.710
[GINKO]
So this is the <i>mushi</i>'s nest.

00:17:24.752 --> 00:17:27.171
Using an animal host
must increase the offspring's

00:17:27.213 --> 00:17:29.090
chances of survival.

00:17:29.131 --> 00:17:30.091
[rustling]

00:17:30.132 --> 00:17:31.592
Someone's coming!

00:17:36.889 --> 00:17:38.599
[MAN 1]
Hey, it's the Living God!

00:17:38.641 --> 00:17:40.393
Where are you going?

00:17:40.434 --> 00:17:42.645
Excuse me, but could you
tell me where I could find

00:17:42.687 --> 00:17:45.064
the cave that's at
the tip of the cape?

00:17:47.316 --> 00:17:49.151
[MAN 1] The Living God
just said something!

00:17:49.193 --> 00:17:50.278
I'm so sorry!

00:17:50.319 --> 00:17:54.574
I'll tell you everything!
Please! Just help me!

00:17:54.615 --> 00:17:56.534
Help me save Nagi!

00:17:59.537 --> 00:18:01.122
[AKOYA'S FATHER]
Nagi. You've returned.

00:18:01.163 --> 00:18:02.665
What are you doing here?

00:18:02.707 --> 00:18:03.374
[NAGI]
It's you!

00:18:03.416 --> 00:18:04.875
How could you do that to Akoya?!

00:18:04.917 --> 00:18:05.668
[GINKO]
Nagi, wait!

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:08.087
This won't help. Let them be.

00:18:08.129 --> 00:18:10.798
Their days are numbered anyway.

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:14.010
Those who continue to use
the <i>mushi</i> for their own needs

00:18:14.051 --> 00:18:16.387
slowly lose their sanity.

00:18:16.429 --> 00:18:19.015
And soon after that,
they'll die.

00:18:19.056 --> 00:18:22.602
You don't have what it takes to
handle the <i>mushi</i>.

00:18:22.643 --> 00:18:24.395
[NAGI]
He's trying to provoke them.

00:18:24.437 --> 00:18:26.564
He must have some kind
of plan worked out.

00:18:26.606 --> 00:18:27.481
Ready, Nagi?

00:18:27.523 --> 00:18:28.065
[NAGI]
Yeah.

00:18:28.107 --> 00:18:29.108
[GINKO]
Run!

00:18:31.068 --> 00:18:31.611
Go!

00:18:31.652 --> 00:18:32.236
[MAN 2]
Yes sir!

00:18:32.278 --> 00:18:34.530
Make sure no one
will find their bodies.

00:18:40.661 --> 00:18:42.997
[AKOYA'S FATHER]
I'll just have to do this again.

00:18:49.295 --> 00:18:50.880
[MAN 3] Look!
He's got one of those flowers!

00:18:50.921 --> 00:18:54.008
[MAN 1] Yeah, just like the one
Akoya said he's been using.

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:55.718
[MAN 3]
It's unforgivable.

00:19:00.139 --> 00:19:02.099
It looks like we've lost them.

00:19:02.141 --> 00:19:03.684
But the tide's rising.

00:19:03.726 --> 00:19:04.852
Damn it.

00:19:04.894 --> 00:19:06.729
We've got an hour, at the most.

00:19:10.066 --> 00:19:10.816
[MAN 4]
It's them!

00:19:10.858 --> 00:19:12.652
Over here! I found them!

00:19:12.693 --> 00:19:16.572
Hey! Stand clear! We're gonna
widen this opening!

00:19:30.044 --> 00:19:32.129
Father...

00:19:32.171 --> 00:19:36.384
It's my fault. I killed you.

00:19:37.635 --> 00:19:39.053
Father...

00:19:39.095 --> 00:19:40.221
[AKOYA'S FATHER]
Akoya!

00:19:40.262 --> 00:19:43.349
I picked this special
flower just for you!

00:19:43.391 --> 00:19:44.475
[NAGI (CHILD)]
Remember that.

00:19:44.517 --> 00:19:46.936
And don't look so sad, okay?

00:19:50.856 --> 00:19:53.526
[AKOYA'S FATHER]
And it smells wonderful!

00:19:53.567 --> 00:19:56.112
Go ahead! Try it!

00:20:01.075 --> 00:20:02.410
Akoya!

00:20:04.495 --> 00:20:08.374
But why?! Tell me!

00:20:08.416 --> 00:20:09.917
[AKOYA]
Nagi...

00:20:09.959 --> 00:20:13.045
I'm... sorry.

00:20:13.087 --> 00:20:14.839
On this side...

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:17.883
I can live... like before.

00:20:19.719 --> 00:20:22.513
It's embedded
deeper than last time.

00:20:22.555 --> 00:20:24.390
It'll be hard to remove.

00:20:28.561 --> 00:20:30.062
It's okay.

00:20:43.117 --> 00:20:46.537
[NAGI] The only time Akoya
ever looked truly happy

00:20:46.579 --> 00:20:49.081
was when she was the Living God.

00:20:57.006 --> 00:20:59.967
[NARRATOR]
Today the sun will rise and set,

00:21:00.009 --> 00:21:02.303
just as it always does.

00:21:02.344 --> 00:21:07.558
Morning blossoms fall,
flower by flower.

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:11.145
Once again, the sun
will set and rise,

00:21:11.187 --> 00:21:13.147
just as it always does.

00:21:13.189 --> 00:21:16.776
And flowers will
bloom everywhere.

00:21:16.817 --> 00:21:19.945
They are different from
the flowers of yesterday.

00:21:19.987 --> 00:21:24.658
But the flowers of today
are just as beautiful.

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:27.161
[NAGI] That day,
Ginko missed his chance

00:21:27.203 --> 00:21:29.246
to leave with the spring tide,

00:21:29.288 --> 00:21:32.082
so he stayed on
the island for a month.

00:21:32.124 --> 00:21:33.417
During that time,

00:21:33.459 --> 00:21:36.629
he was able to treat
all the people on the cape.

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:40.007
But even so, whenever
the spring tide came

00:21:40.049 --> 00:21:41.801
and the cave opened up,

00:21:41.842 --> 00:21:46.222
someone became the
Living God once again.

00:21:46.263 --> 00:21:47.723
[GINKO] There are
most likely some people

00:21:47.765 --> 00:21:50.100
that won't appreciate
the treatment.

00:21:50.142 --> 00:21:53.479
They'll probably
smell the flower again.

00:21:53.521 --> 00:21:55.481
[GINKO]
Akoya said...

00:21:55.523 --> 00:21:57.441
[AKOYA]
I'm frightened.

00:21:57.483 --> 00:22:00.820
I feel overpowered by the
uncertainty of everything

00:22:00.861 --> 00:22:03.906
that lies in front of me.

00:22:03.948 --> 00:22:06.992
She and I are not all
that different, are we?

00:22:07.034 --> 00:22:08.494
Just look at me.

00:22:08.536 --> 00:22:12.456
I have no idea what I'm
supposed to do from now on.

00:22:12.498 --> 00:22:15.960
You should just
live a normal life.

00:22:16.001 --> 00:22:18.963
Things will be a little
better once you're able to fish.

00:22:19.004 --> 00:22:21.090
You should get everyone
to help you open up the cave

00:22:21.131 --> 00:22:23.968
to allow more boats
to go out to sea.

00:22:24.009 --> 00:22:26.095
It's not going to be easy.

00:22:29.723 --> 00:22:33.269
But there's one thing you can
count on to be on your side...

00:22:35.855 --> 00:22:39.608
The endless amount of time
that waits in front of you.
