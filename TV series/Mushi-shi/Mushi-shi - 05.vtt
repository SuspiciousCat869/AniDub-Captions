Hmm...

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.910
A <i>mushi</i> that devours silence...

One that causes horns
to grow on its living host?

It's quite rare...

Quite rare indeed.

Hey, what's that?

[GINKO] The cup of a

A living swamp?

[GINKO] As I traveled
through the mountains...

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:05.936
I encountered many swamps.

[GINKO]
Every time I went around one,

00:03:22.994 --> 00:03:24.329
I would glance over my shoulder

00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:26.415
and notice something
very puzzling.

00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.085
[GINKO] The swamp had
completely vanished,

00:03:30.127 --> 00:03:33.130

Then when I crossed
the next mountain,

00:03:35.173 --> 00:03:37.217
I was met with
another surprise...

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:41.054
A swamp exactly like
the one I'd just seen.

It's you again.

I saw you at the last swamp.
That was you, wasn't it?

there's a shortcut

this unearthly green.

[gasps]

00:04:21.052 --> 00:04:22.846
[GINKO] It seemed as if
the waters of the swamp

00:04:22.888 --> 00:04:25.182
had saturated it to the root.

Excuse me?

00:04:39.738 --> 00:04:41.782
What lies in this direction?

00:04:41.823 --> 00:04:43.784
Beyond the next hill?

00:04:43.825 --> 00:04:44.785
[GINKO]
Hm?

00:04:44.826 --> 00:04:47.746
I'll answer. But only if
you let me ask a question.

00:04:47.788 --> 00:04:49.122
Is that fair enough?

00:04:50.207 --> 00:04:51.708
[GINKO]
This swamp we're in.

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.544
There's nothing ordinary
about it, is there?

00:04:58.089 --> 00:04:59.716
[IO]
This swamp...

00:04:59.758 --> 00:05:02.302
It travels, you see.

00:05:02.344 --> 00:05:04.721
It comes up, sinks
down in the ground,

00:05:04.763 --> 00:05:07.182
and then resurfaces
in a new spot.

00:05:07.224 --> 00:05:09.142
It's on a very
important journey.

00:05:09.184 --> 00:05:12.270
Like you, it seeks a passage
through these mountains.

00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:14.648
Huh... A living swamp.

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:16.066
That's incredible.

00:05:16.107 --> 00:05:19.194
So, are you moving along
with it as it travels?

00:05:20.445 --> 00:05:22.072
[GINKO]
Why?

00:05:22.113 --> 00:05:23.406
What for?

00:05:26.243 --> 00:05:27.911
[GINKO]
Well, then, anyway...

00:05:27.953 --> 00:05:29.454
If you keep heading
in that direction,

00:05:29.496 --> 00:05:31.331
you'll reach the sea.

00:05:31.373 --> 00:05:35.168
I'm headed to a fishing village
there to see an old friend.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:36.837
Once the swamp reaches the sea,

00:05:36.878 --> 00:05:39.714
it'll be impossible for you
to travel with it, you know?

00:05:41.383 --> 00:05:42.676
[GINKO]
Oh, by the way...

00:05:42.717 --> 00:05:43.885
If it's all right with you...

tell right now...

But it might be a new species.

think you would believe me...

Let's just say I'm...

00:06:03.822 --> 00:06:06.700
...used to strange things
in my line of work.

Line of work?

00:06:09.244 --> 00:06:10.912
[GINKO]
I'm a <i>mushi</i> master.

00:06:10.954 --> 00:06:13.373
<i>Mushi</i> and their
related phenomena...

00:06:13.415 --> 00:06:15.292
They're all pretty strange.

00:06:15.333 --> 00:06:17.085
Let's take the <i>suiko,</i>
for example.

00:06:17.127 --> 00:06:18.670
A species of <i>mushi...</i>

00:06:18.712 --> 00:06:21.423
...that exists as a liquid.

00:06:21.464 --> 00:06:23.925
<i>Suiko</i> is clear and colorless...

00:06:23.967 --> 00:06:25.093
...yet alive.

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.931
[GINKO] It dwells primarily
in old water veins.

00:06:29.973 --> 00:06:32.392
Sometimes even in
ponds and wells.

00:06:32.434 --> 00:06:35.395
If one mistakes <i>suiko</i> for
water and keeps drinking it,

00:06:35.437 --> 00:06:36.771
they soon become
unable to breathe

00:06:36.813 --> 00:06:38.356
unless they're immersed in it.

00:06:38.398 --> 00:06:42.235
And even worse, their body
becomes transparent.

00:06:42.277 --> 00:06:46.489
Eventually, the body turns to
liquid... and then flows away.

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.784
[GINKO]
The <i>mushi</i> then disappears.

00:06:49.826 --> 00:06:53.538
To where is anyone's guess.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.707
So if things like
that can exist...

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:59.002
...the idea of a traveling
swamp isn't too hard to swallow.

00:06:59.044 --> 00:07:00.879
You get used to it.

00:07:00.921 --> 00:07:02.589
What about you?

00:07:02.631 --> 00:07:05.175

this to be frightening?

In fact, the first

00:07:18.021 --> 00:07:20.273

different impression.

It's a small price
to pay, though.

I'd be dead if it
weren't for this swamp.

It said, "You may live."

00:08:40.603 --> 00:08:44.149
It granted me a new life
and I'll never leave it.

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:47.569

I can ever call home.

00:11:48.791 --> 00:11:49.959
[GINKO]
You...

00:11:54.422 --> 00:11:56.507
[GINKO]
You wanted to live, didn't you?

00:12:12.065 --> 00:12:13.900
[GINKO]
This living swamp...

00:12:13.942 --> 00:12:15.860
It's heading for the sea.

00:12:18.196 --> 00:12:19.447
[ADASHINO]
Hm...

00:12:19.489 --> 00:12:21.741
A swamp heading for the sea?

00:12:21.783 --> 00:12:23.785
Have you ever heard of this?

00:12:23.826 --> 00:12:24.827
[ADASHINO]
Well, now that you mention it,

00:12:24.869 --> 00:12:26.496
I think I just might have.

00:12:26.537 --> 00:12:28.873
An old fisherman told
me a story years ago

00:12:28.915 --> 00:12:32.293
about a big green something that
followed the river to the sea.

00:12:32.335 --> 00:12:33.711
It was larger than a whale

00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:36.172
and when it reached the sea,
it disintegrated.

00:12:36.214 --> 00:12:38.591
Just melted away.

00:12:38.633 --> 00:12:39.425
This man...

00:12:39.467 --> 00:12:41.803
...never claimed
to see the thing.

00:12:41.844 --> 00:12:43.429
But his father did.

00:12:43.471 --> 00:12:47.183
In his opinion, it was
looking for a place to die.

00:12:47.225 --> 00:12:49.519
Come. Time is of the essence.

00:12:50.645 --> 00:12:52.272
[ADASHINO] Since we haven't
heard any commotion

00:12:52.313 --> 00:12:53.189
from the fishermen,

00:12:53.231 --> 00:12:56.484
I'll wager that your swamp
hasn't arrived here as of yet.

00:12:59.862 --> 00:13:02.198
Ah, here it is!

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:05.034
A map of the underground
water veins in the area.

00:13:05.076 --> 00:13:07.161
It's quite rare.

00:13:07.203 --> 00:13:08.830
It was drafted based
on the findings

00:13:08.871 --> 00:13:10.707
of dowsing rods a few years ago.

00:13:10.748 --> 00:13:12.292
[GINKO]
How accurate is it?

00:13:12.333 --> 00:13:13.960
[ADASHINO] Judging by some
test wells that were dug,

00:13:14.002 --> 00:13:15.712
I'd say fifty-fifty.

00:13:15.753 --> 00:13:17.380
[GINKO] The locations
of the swamps I saw

00:13:17.422 --> 00:13:19.465
correspond with
these water veins.

00:13:19.507 --> 00:13:23.428
Does the <i>suiko</i> travel along
them as if they were roads?

00:13:23.469 --> 00:13:26.180
This vein... It looks
like it goes to the sea.

00:13:26.222 --> 00:13:26.973
But it forks here.

00:13:27.015 --> 00:13:29.600
Makes the swamp's location
hard to pin down.

00:13:29.642 --> 00:13:30.476
Ginko.

00:13:30.518 --> 00:13:31.894
Up here.

00:13:31.936 --> 00:13:33.730
I've got another map.

00:13:33.771 --> 00:13:35.606
It's an older one--
also quite rare--

00:13:35.648 --> 00:13:38.526
and it shows where the rivers
were thousands of years ago.

00:13:38.568 --> 00:13:40.528
The estuaries are
still in the same place,

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:42.530
but the rivers have
significantly changed.

00:13:42.572 --> 00:13:44.282
[GINKO]
Enough, already.

00:13:44.324 --> 00:13:45.825
Quit boasting about
your collection

00:13:45.867 --> 00:13:47.660
and come down here and
help me figure this--

00:13:50.121 --> 00:13:51.331
Let me see that.

00:13:56.711 --> 00:13:58.171
They're identical.

00:13:58.212 --> 00:13:59.756
Interesting...

00:13:59.797 --> 00:14:03.217
These water veins were
a river a long time ago.

00:14:03.259 --> 00:14:04.844
But at some point,
it dried up.

00:14:04.886 --> 00:14:06.095
Over time, all that remained was

00:14:06.137 --> 00:14:09.223
a layer of stones
buried underground.

00:14:09.265 --> 00:14:10.641
Rainwater drains into the ground

00:14:10.683 --> 00:14:12.727
and then seeps towards
that layer of rock.

00:14:14.479 --> 00:14:15.605
[GINKO]
Once it's there,

00:14:15.646 --> 00:14:18.149
it gathers in the form
of these water veins.

00:14:18.191 --> 00:14:20.151
An underground river...

00:14:21.569 --> 00:14:23.196
[GINKO]
If that swamp is ancient,

00:14:23.237 --> 00:14:24.989
it may very well be
following its memory

00:14:25.031 --> 00:14:27.158
of how the old river flowed.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.994
Heading for a predestined
place to... die.

00:14:30.036 --> 00:14:32.872
Just like a salmon
or a sweetfish.

00:14:32.914 --> 00:14:36.542
[GINKO] If it follows this vein,
it will emerge in this estuary.

00:14:36.584 --> 00:14:39.337
If it reaches the sea,
it's too late.

00:14:39.379 --> 00:14:40.129
Adashino!

00:14:40.171 --> 00:14:40.797
[ADASHINO]
Hm?

00:14:40.838 --> 00:14:42.131
[GINKO]
Get as many people as you can

00:14:42.173 --> 00:14:44.425
and the biggest fishing
nets in the village!

00:14:46.636 --> 00:14:47.929
That's it...!

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:49.180
Pull it...!

00:14:49.222 --> 00:14:50.223
Come on!

00:14:50.264 --> 00:14:52.225
[FISHERMAN yell]

00:14:54.352 --> 00:14:56.354
[ADASHINO] So many of you
turned out to help us.

00:14:56.396 --> 00:14:57.730
Thank you so much.

00:14:57.772 --> 00:14:58.398
You're welcome.

00:14:58.439 --> 00:15:00.233
Besides, we fishermen
have a lot of idle time

00:15:00.274 --> 00:15:01.734
on our hands right now.

00:15:01.776 --> 00:15:03.986
This time of year, there's so
few fish in these waters

00:15:04.028 --> 00:15:06.114
that you'd think the sea
had gone and died.

00:15:06.155 --> 00:15:07.448
After all you've done for us,

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:10.201
we'd do anything
for you, Dr. Adashino.

00:15:10.243 --> 00:15:12.370
[GINKO] Being a doctor
bought you this loyalty?

00:15:12.412 --> 00:15:13.496
Not just that.

00:15:13.538 --> 00:15:14.622
Don't forget...

00:15:14.664 --> 00:15:15.998
I'm charming.

00:15:18.626 --> 00:15:19.502
[ADASHINO]
Be honest.

00:15:19.544 --> 00:15:21.754
Even after all this effort,
you really don't know

00:15:21.796 --> 00:15:24.465
if these nets will actually
snag that girl, do you?

00:15:24.507 --> 00:15:25.508
[GINKO]
No...

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:28.636
But it's the only chance I
think we have at saving her.

00:15:28.678 --> 00:15:29.345
[ADASHINO]
Tell me...

00:15:29.387 --> 00:15:31.973
Why is this so
important to you?

00:15:32.014 --> 00:15:32.682
This girl...

00:15:32.723 --> 00:15:35.393
Why does she weigh so
heavy on your conscience?

00:15:37.728 --> 00:15:39.772
[ADASHINO] I could sympathize
with your concern better

00:15:39.814 --> 00:15:41.983
if the girl had said
she wanted to live.

00:15:42.024 --> 00:15:43.151
But from what you told me,

00:15:43.192 --> 00:15:46.654
it sounds like her sole desire
was to become part of the swamp.

00:15:46.696 --> 00:15:49.824
Perhaps this path she has
chosen brings her happiness.

00:15:49.866 --> 00:15:53.161
And if that's so,
should we deny her fate?

00:15:53.202 --> 00:15:55.538
However cruel it may seem?

00:15:57.707 --> 00:15:59.959
You know that green cup
that I brought you?

00:16:00.001 --> 00:16:00.918
[ADASHINO]
Huh?

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:02.211
It's a re-creation of one

00:16:02.253 --> 00:16:05.089
that belonged to that
young man's grandmother.

00:16:05.131 --> 00:16:07.091
She brought the original
to a <i>mushi</i> banquet that

00:16:07.133 --> 00:16:09.260
was unfortunately cut short.

00:16:09.302 --> 00:16:11.971
That left her trapped in
limbo between two worlds,

00:16:12.013 --> 00:16:15.224
and in a ghostly state that
was neither <i>mushi</i> nor human.

00:16:16.434 --> 00:16:17.685
[GINKO]
Re-creating that cup

00:16:17.727 --> 00:16:20.188
allowed her grandson
to see her again.

00:16:21.439 --> 00:16:23.566
[GINKO]
But that stole her humanity.

00:16:23.608 --> 00:16:26.736
I made her <i>mushi</i> because
she requested it.

00:16:26.777 --> 00:16:27.361
But I...

00:16:27.403 --> 00:16:29.906
I question if I did
the right thing or not.

00:16:31.449 --> 00:16:34.368
[GINKO] Becoming <i>mushi</i> isn't
like a traditional death.

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:38.331
<i>Mushi</i> occupy a spot between
the living and the dead.

00:16:38.372 --> 00:16:42.960
That means, the person
still lives in one sense...

00:16:43.002 --> 00:16:45.129
But then they're dead
in yet another.

00:16:45.171 --> 00:16:48.466
Imagine what
that must be like.

00:16:48.508 --> 00:16:50.343
Wouldn't a natural death
be more tolerable

00:16:50.384 --> 00:16:52.470
than living for eons?

00:16:52.512 --> 00:16:54.388
A life where everything
that made you human

00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:57.600
is whittled away, bit by bit,

00:16:57.642 --> 00:17:01.354
until absolutely
none of it remains?

00:17:01.395 --> 00:17:04.440
That's the sad fate for
which the girl is headed.

00:17:04.482 --> 00:17:07.276
She even dressed up
for the occasion.

00:17:07.318 --> 00:17:09.445
Her kimono would suit a wedding.

00:17:09.487 --> 00:17:12.865
Or in her case,
someone's funeral.

00:17:12.907 --> 00:17:16.202
So yes, this
cruel fate of hers...

00:17:16.244 --> 00:17:18.246
It is one to be denied.

00:17:20.831 --> 00:17:23.334
If you ask me,
there's nothing out there.

00:20:20.261 --> 00:20:23.097
...was so terrified of dying.

00:20:23.139 --> 00:20:25.141
But I was also...

00:20:25.182 --> 00:20:28.644
...so very sad that
the-- the swamp...

00:20:28.686 --> 00:20:32.398
It was dying all around me...

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:34.525
And now it's gone...

00:20:34.567 --> 00:20:39.321
[sobs]

00:20:39.363 --> 00:20:42.158
That swamp lived for
thousands of years.

00:20:42.199 --> 00:20:45.369
It chose you to accompany
it on its final journey.

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:50.207
[GINKO]
You're very fortunate.

00:20:54.712 --> 00:20:56.172
[IO]
Yes...

00:20:59.759 --> 00:21:00.801
[GIRLS laughing]

00:21:00.843 --> 00:21:01.886
Io!

00:21:01.927 --> 00:21:03.971
Hey there!

00:21:04.013 --> 00:21:05.931
Dr. Adashino! Hello!

00:21:08.726 --> 00:21:11.145
[ADASHINO] Ah! Looks like
Another big catch today?

00:21:11.187 --> 00:21:12.146
[IO]
Yes...

00:21:12.188 --> 00:21:14.607
Fish are still swarming
in from all around.

00:21:14.648 --> 00:21:16.650
The swamp's remains
draw them here.

00:21:16.692 --> 00:21:18.444
They feast on it.

00:21:19.445 --> 00:21:22.281
So... I see that your
hair has changed.

00:21:22.323 --> 00:21:23.240
It has...

00:21:23.282 --> 00:21:24.200
And that's not all.

00:21:24.241 --> 00:21:27.703
I can't breathe underwater
anymore, either.

00:21:27.745 --> 00:21:30.581
But I've come to accept that.

00:21:30.623 --> 00:21:33.125
I'll live a happy life here...

00:21:33.167 --> 00:21:35.252
...on the shores of the sea...

00:21:35.294 --> 00:21:36.921
...where the swamp died.

00:21:41.801 --> 00:21:43.594
More swamps. Terrific.

00:21:44.637 --> 00:21:48.015
[GINKO]
One... two... three... four...

00:21:48.057 --> 00:21:50.976
And here I thought that
it left no trace of itself.

00:21:51.018 --> 00:21:52.102
[scoffs]

00:21:53.145 --> 00:21:54.605
[GINKO]
It was coming up to the surface

00:21:54.647 --> 00:21:56.857
to leave its children behind.

00:22:00.277 --> 00:22:02.446
[NARRATOR]
A swamp is born...

00:22:02.488 --> 00:22:04.824
...but eventually goes dry.

00:22:04.865 --> 00:22:07.743
Such is the life of a swamp.

00:22:07.785 --> 00:22:11.664
But the swamp does not always
accept its fate with good cheer.

00:22:11.705 --> 00:22:14.750
When the life within its
waters begins to fade...

00:22:14.792 --> 00:22:16.752
...it sometimes walks away.

00:23:47.927 --> 00:23:51.764
