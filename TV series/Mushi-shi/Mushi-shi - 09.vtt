We don't give

It's not every year
that we have a good crop.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.953
So when we do, everything
that we harvest is stored away.

Huh...

00:03:23.912 --> 00:03:27.833
So this year's crop is a little
better than usual, I take it?

Yeah, it is.

My village always honors and
celebrates our ancestors.

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:34.589
That's why they've
continued to watch over us

and protect us from harm.

00:03:39.177 --> 00:03:40.262
And in exchange,

they take the life of
someone in the village, right?

00:03:44.683 --> 00:03:48.520

Would you mind
telling me about it?

[SANE] Every time this village
suffers a natural disaster,

00:04:07.164 --> 00:04:09.124
its crops flourish.

00:04:09.166 --> 00:04:12.753
I've heard this has been
happening for many, many years.

00:04:12.794 --> 00:04:14.337
In the fall of these years,

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:16.798
someone in the village
always grows a <i>Mizuha</i>,

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.967
an out-of-place tooth
symbolizing happiness

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:20.260
and blessings.

00:04:20.302 --> 00:04:22.971
At the end of the season,
the tooth falls out

00:04:23.013 --> 00:04:27.893
and the host... always dies.

00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:33.815
[SANE] It's said that the life
is an offering to the ancestors

Still, everyone here
is grateful.

If these miracles were to cease,

00:04:43.867 --> 00:04:45.410

have anything in common?

The tooth?

00:05:05.514 --> 00:05:09.059
It's kept in the temple
by the Head Priest.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.352
Head Priest?

00:05:10.393 --> 00:05:11.520
He's the one that takes care

00:05:11.561 --> 00:05:14.523
of all of the
village's festivities.

00:05:14.564 --> 00:05:17.192
After he's gone,
I am to become his successor.

00:05:17.234 --> 00:05:19.736
So I've been learning from him.

00:05:19.778 --> 00:05:22.030
Apparently, soon after
the tooth falls out,

00:05:22.072 --> 00:05:24.491
it's only visible
to the Head Priest.

00:05:24.533 --> 00:05:26.618
That's why he's the
one that keeps it.

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:30.622
[GINKO] Why were you chosen
to be his successor?

00:05:30.664 --> 00:05:33.166
It's because of what
we share in common.

00:05:33.208 --> 00:05:36.169
I too can sometimes see
things that others cannot.

00:05:39.172 --> 00:05:41.299

We need to be ready.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.263
It's going to be quite
a harvest this year.

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:31.766
[SAISHU]
Come now.

00:06:31.808 --> 00:06:34.019
Are you still worried
about your mother?

00:06:35.604 --> 00:06:38.106
Hey, it'll be all right.
Don't worry.

00:06:38.148 --> 00:06:40.150
She's going to be fine.

00:06:40.191 --> 00:06:42.360
Here. Have her eat this.

00:06:50.827 --> 00:06:53.496
[SAISHU] I was told that a <i>mushi</i>
Master passed through here

00:06:53.538 --> 00:06:55.665
during the time of
my predecessor.

00:06:57.292 --> 00:06:58.710
But you've wasted your time.

00:06:58.752 --> 00:07:00.754
There's no such seed
around here.

00:07:02.464 --> 00:07:03.173
So...

00:07:03.214 --> 00:07:06.176
This harvest is achieved through
the grace of your ancestors?

00:07:06.217 --> 00:07:08.970
[SAISHU]
The grace of our ancestors?

00:07:09.012 --> 00:07:11.056
Well, that is part of it.

00:07:11.097 --> 00:07:12.891
Because of our faith in them,

00:07:12.933 --> 00:07:16.811
our people are able to work
the land without giving up.

00:07:16.853 --> 00:07:19.022
But that's not the only reason.

00:07:19.064 --> 00:07:20.231
Over the years,

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:22.025
we've experimented
with our crops,

00:07:22.067 --> 00:07:24.486
and developed better
ways to grow them.

00:07:24.527 --> 00:07:26.237
From time to time,

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:28.949
we end up with a crop
like this one.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:31.451
We harvest more every year.

00:07:31.493 --> 00:07:32.535
Tell me...

00:07:32.577 --> 00:07:34.287
What do you know
about the <i>Mizuha</i>?

00:07:36.998 --> 00:07:40.085
An adult getting a new tooth
isn't entirely unheard of.

00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:42.087
It has nothing to do
with the harvest.

00:07:42.128 --> 00:07:43.922
Now, if you'll excuse me.

00:07:43.964 --> 00:07:46.007
I have one more
thing to ask you.

00:07:48.051 --> 00:07:49.511
What is it?

00:07:49.552 --> 00:07:52.222
Do you know anything
about the <i>Nazaru</i> seed?

00:07:53.515 --> 00:07:56.518
Yes. My ancestors
spoke of it.

00:07:56.559 --> 00:07:59.354
Supposedly, a <i>mushi</i> Master
sealed the <i>Koumyaku</i>

00:07:59.396 --> 00:08:01.356
inside of it.

00:08:01.398 --> 00:08:03.024
The <i>mushi</i> light pulse.

00:08:03.066 --> 00:08:04.275
[GINKO]
Right.

00:08:04.317 --> 00:08:07.779
You can probably see that
light pulse, can't you?

00:08:07.821 --> 00:08:10.156
Since you can also
see the <i>mushi.</i>

00:08:12.367 --> 00:08:13.868
[GINKO]
The weaker the <i>mushi</i> are,

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:16.621
the brighter their
light pulse becomes.

00:08:16.663 --> 00:08:19.916
This is because when weakened,
they're closer to their source.

00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:23.169
The <i>koki</i>, which the
light pulse flows through.

00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:25.797
The <i>koki</i> is basically
life itself.

00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:28.842
If you can control it,
it can be used for many things,

00:08:28.883 --> 00:08:32.470
including resurrection
and eternal life.

00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:34.556
Of course, such things
are the most prohibited

00:08:34.597 --> 00:08:37.350
transgressions a
<i>mushi</i> Master can commit.

00:08:37.392 --> 00:08:40.270
But there have been exceptions.

00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:43.189
The <i>Nazaru</i> seed is one of them.

00:08:43.231 --> 00:08:45.442
When planted, it brings
a full year's harvest

00:08:45.483 --> 00:08:47.277
to the area around it.

00:08:47.318 --> 00:08:48.945
As payment, it takes one life

00:08:48.987 --> 00:08:50.822
from those who
benefited from it.

00:08:52.699 --> 00:08:55.243
That is what we know of it.

00:08:55.285 --> 00:08:56.161
Tell me...

00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:58.788
What exactly would you plan
to do with this seed

00:08:58.830 --> 00:08:59.998
if you found it?

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:04.294
Would you make use of it
or destroy it?

00:09:04.335 --> 00:09:06.755
That's what I was
about to ask you.

00:09:06.796 --> 00:09:08.965
What would you do with the seed?

00:09:09.007 --> 00:09:12.260
A seed that has the power
to save thousands of lives

00:09:12.302 --> 00:09:13.928
at the cost of only one.

00:09:15.555 --> 00:09:16.973
[SAISHU]
I'd probably use it.

00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:21.561
I think that if such
a seed really did exist,

00:09:21.603 --> 00:09:24.898
it would be a sin
to let so many suffer.

00:09:24.939 --> 00:09:27.025
[GINKO] But if you planted
the seed knowing full well

00:09:27.067 --> 00:09:29.319
that it was going
to take a life,

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.446
then it's the same as murder.

00:09:31.488 --> 00:09:34.449
No matter how many lives
are saved by using it,

00:09:34.491 --> 00:09:37.035
someone becomes a
sacrifice regardless

00:09:37.077 --> 00:09:38.661
of his or her own will.

00:09:41.289 --> 00:09:43.541
If that is the
cost of the crime,

00:09:43.583 --> 00:09:45.627
then anyone would
soil their hands,

00:09:45.668 --> 00:09:49.047
even if you were just
trading two lives for one.

00:09:49.089 --> 00:09:51.549
Yeah, I understand how
someone would choose to use it,

00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:53.885
looking at it in
the terms of one year.

00:09:53.927 --> 00:09:57.597
But if you used it one time,
you would surely use it again.

00:09:57.639 --> 00:09:59.265
And that seed is alive.

00:09:59.307 --> 00:10:02.852
The more you use it,
the more powerful it becomes.

00:10:02.894 --> 00:10:08.066
Eventually, it would destroy the
balance of everything around it.

00:10:08.108 --> 00:10:10.735
[SAISHU] So if it were you,
you wouldn't use it?

00:10:10.777 --> 00:10:14.489
Knowing you could
save so many lives.

00:10:14.531 --> 00:10:15.740
I don't know.

00:10:15.782 --> 00:10:18.368
I've never lived
in a village before.

00:10:18.409 --> 00:10:20.161
But I think I'd
just leave the land.

00:10:21.913 --> 00:10:24.082
[SAISHU] In this ground
beneath our feet

00:10:24.124 --> 00:10:26.918
lie the sweat and blood
of my ancestors!

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.213
They pioneered this land
and made it what it is today.

00:10:30.255 --> 00:10:32.382
It's our greatest achievement!

00:10:32.423 --> 00:10:34.425
But wouldn't you be
tainting this precious land

00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:37.428
by planting something in
it that's so unnatural?

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.269
You have quite an imagination.

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:46.020
What am I saying?

00:10:46.062 --> 00:10:48.314
This is all supposition.

00:10:48.356 --> 00:10:51.568
If there was such
a seed in my possession

00:10:51.609 --> 00:10:53.820
and I had to make that choice...

00:10:55.989 --> 00:10:57.782
I would...

00:10:57.824 --> 00:11:00.326
I would have to think
about it some more.

00:11:02.537 --> 00:11:06.249
[SAISHU] There will always be
leftover seed in one's hands.

00:11:06.291 --> 00:11:10.128
There's too much of it
for anyone to bear alone.

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:11.546
Just like the heavy seed

00:11:11.588 --> 00:11:14.257
that burdens an
overgrowing stem,

00:11:14.299 --> 00:11:17.135
it will overflow and
pour out over the hands

00:11:17.177 --> 00:11:20.597
and fall upon the soil,

00:11:20.638 --> 00:11:22.932
unaware of the
pain and suffering

00:11:22.974 --> 00:11:25.935
it will cause the people
in its aftermath.

00:11:33.193 --> 00:11:35.111
Finished talking already?

00:11:35.153 --> 00:11:37.989
We have. For the most part.

00:11:38.031 --> 00:11:40.200
So then, what happens now?

00:11:40.241 --> 00:11:41.951
Are you going to save us?

00:11:41.993 --> 00:11:42.785
I am.

00:11:42.827 --> 00:11:45.955
But first, I'll need the consent
of the entire village.

00:11:45.997 --> 00:11:49.626
They need to know what's
behind the "Parting Harvest."

00:11:49.667 --> 00:11:52.045
Could you gather
everyone somewhere?

00:11:52.086 --> 00:11:53.379
Yeah, sure.

00:11:53.421 --> 00:11:55.548
But what... what are
you planning to--

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:56.424
[SAISHU]
So...

00:11:56.466 --> 00:11:58.176
Are you going
to burn the fields?

00:12:01.638 --> 00:12:04.182
You think you can stop
this by destroying the crops

00:12:04.224 --> 00:12:07.143
before someone grows
the <i>Mizuha</i> tooth.

00:12:07.185 --> 00:12:08.353
Yeah, that's right.

00:12:08.394 --> 00:12:10.230
So you're finally
admitting the truth.

00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:12.440
You're wrong, <i>mushi</i> Master.

00:12:12.482 --> 00:12:14.901
Destroying the crops
won't do anything.

00:12:14.943 --> 00:12:17.320
You'll only bring this
village to starvation!

00:12:17.362 --> 00:12:20.365
All they'll have to do is
move away for one year.

00:12:20.406 --> 00:12:22.242
They'll need to
split up, dissipate,

00:12:22.283 --> 00:12:24.410
and live in different
places during that time.

00:12:24.452 --> 00:12:27.163
If they can do that,
they should survive.

00:12:27.205 --> 00:12:30.667
By the spring, the ashes will
have fertilized the ground.

00:12:30.708 --> 00:12:32.961
How many do you think
would actually return

00:12:33.002 --> 00:12:35.213
once they leave this place?

00:12:35.255 --> 00:12:38.508
No one here knows what
a true abundant harvest is.

00:12:38.549 --> 00:12:42.470
That's how they're able to
keep trying, and to have hope.

00:12:42.512 --> 00:12:44.681
Just leave us alone.

00:12:44.722 --> 00:12:46.349
Get out of here.

00:12:46.391 --> 00:12:49.018
I won't allow you
to tell them such...

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:50.687
Such nonsense!

00:12:50.728 --> 00:12:52.021
[SAISHI groans]

00:12:53.982 --> 00:12:55.024
[SANE]
Saishu!

00:13:02.532 --> 00:13:06.369
Does he have some kind
of illness or condition?

00:13:06.411 --> 00:13:08.079
[SANE]
I can't say for sure,

00:13:08.121 --> 00:13:10.623
but I know he hasn't been
feeling well lately.

00:13:10.665 --> 00:13:12.625
and I've seen him
taking medicine.

00:13:12.667 --> 00:13:14.419
[GINKO]
Medicine?

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:16.963
[SANE]
Yeah. He keeps it in this.

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:32.103
[GINKO] I'm not sure why you've
been poisoning yourself

00:13:32.145 --> 00:13:34.856
with this,
but it's irresponsible,

00:13:34.897 --> 00:13:36.566
considering what you'd
be leaving behind

00:13:36.607 --> 00:13:37.900
for the people here.

00:13:39.736 --> 00:13:41.904
[SAISHU]
Tell me, <i>mushi</i> Master.

00:13:41.946 --> 00:13:44.157
Since you want to
burn the fields,

00:13:44.198 --> 00:13:45.700
I'm guessing you
didn't come here

00:13:45.742 --> 00:13:48.995
to collect and use
the seed, did you?

00:13:49.037 --> 00:13:50.830
Please, help me.

00:13:50.872 --> 00:13:53.958
I've been trying to become
the weakest among us

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.086
so that the seed's
final victim...

00:13:57.128 --> 00:13:58.421
...will be me.

00:14:01.966 --> 00:14:05.553
[SAISHU] It's been said that the
one who brought the seed here

00:14:05.595 --> 00:14:07.513
was of my own lineage.

00:14:07.555 --> 00:14:09.599
A former Head Priest.

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:13.186
Since then, every time a
natural disaster occurred,

00:14:13.227 --> 00:14:15.355
the seed was used.

00:14:15.396 --> 00:14:16.981
In order to prevent a panic,

00:14:17.023 --> 00:14:20.902
the seed's location has only
been known by the Head Priests.

00:14:20.943 --> 00:14:24.072
Twenty years ago,
when I became the Head Priest,

00:14:24.113 --> 00:14:28.576
another devastating natural
disaster occurred.

00:14:28.618 --> 00:14:31.579
I felt I had no choice
but to use it.

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:36.125
[SAISHU]
I'm going out for a bit.

00:14:36.167 --> 00:14:38.002
[SAISHU'S WIFE]
All right. Be careful, okay?

00:14:40.671 --> 00:14:42.048
[SAISHU'S WIFE coughs]

00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:51.808
[SAISHU]
This is the right thing to do.

00:14:51.849 --> 00:14:53.810
I was only thinking
of what was best

00:14:53.851 --> 00:14:55.895
for the entire village.

00:14:55.937 --> 00:14:58.398
I know it is.
It has to be.

00:14:59.524 --> 00:15:01.984
[SAISHU] I was unaware
that my wife was hiding

00:15:02.026 --> 00:15:04.237
her illness from me.

00:15:04.278 --> 00:15:06.030
When autumn came,

00:15:06.072 --> 00:15:09.325
she was the one who
grew the <i>Mizuha</i> tooth.

00:15:14.831 --> 00:15:15.998
[SAISHU'S WIFE]
Please, dear.

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:19.585
Have some rice.
I beg of you.

00:15:19.627 --> 00:15:21.838
I don't want you to die, too.

00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:27.301
[SAISHU]
What are you doing?!

00:15:30.513 --> 00:15:33.474
[SAISHU'S WIFE]
Please, eat this.

00:15:33.516 --> 00:15:36.769
If I know that you're taking
my life within your body,

00:15:36.811 --> 00:15:39.313
then I can die without
knowing any fear.

00:15:41.399 --> 00:15:44.235
[SAISHU] Despite knowing
what this rice really was,

00:15:44.277 --> 00:15:48.698
and where it came from,
my body greedily accepted it.

00:15:49.907 --> 00:15:52.452
[SAISHU] I had fully intended
to throw away the seed

00:15:52.493 --> 00:15:55.288
that fell from my wife's mouth.

00:15:55.329 --> 00:15:58.124
But then considered
the next natural disaster

00:15:58.166 --> 00:16:00.543
that was sure to come.

00:16:00.585 --> 00:16:05.465
Eventually, I thought of a way I
could use the seed one last time

00:16:05.506 --> 00:16:08.176
without having to
sacrifice someone's life.

00:16:11.095 --> 00:16:13.514
[SAISHU]
This year, that time came.

00:16:30.865 --> 00:16:33.201
I intend to have
Sane destroy the seed

00:16:33.242 --> 00:16:35.328
once it has fallen
from my mouth.

00:16:35.369 --> 00:16:36.746
It's been said

00:16:36.787 --> 00:16:39.665
that if you bury it in the
veins of the <i>Koumyaku</i>,

00:16:39.707 --> 00:16:42.877
it loses its shape
and is taken in.

00:16:42.919 --> 00:16:45.087
I have no intention
of telling him

00:16:45.129 --> 00:16:48.299
what it is the seed
actually does.

00:16:48.341 --> 00:16:50.092
Are you okay with that?

00:16:50.134 --> 00:16:52.345
You, more than anyone,

00:16:52.386 --> 00:16:56.307
want to live here and watch over
the land of your ancestors.

00:16:56.349 --> 00:16:58.392
[SAISHU]
I can see it already.

00:16:58.434 --> 00:17:01.854
As long as we keep
trying and don't give up,

00:17:01.896 --> 00:17:05.608
slowly but surely,
this land will become fertile.

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:08.152
The day will come when
we can live off of this land

00:17:08.194 --> 00:17:09.779
without suffering.

00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:12.031
I don't know how many
generations it will take,

00:17:12.073 --> 00:17:13.366
but that matters not.

00:17:13.407 --> 00:17:15.743
Either way, I won't
be around to see it.

00:17:19.997 --> 00:17:22.083
[GINKO]
All right. I understand.

00:17:22.124 --> 00:17:23.960
Do as you wish.

00:17:24.001 --> 00:17:26.754
But there's one more thing
I'd like to ask you.

00:17:41.561 --> 00:17:44.063
[SAISHU coughing]

00:17:56.909 --> 00:17:57.994
[SANE]
Saishu!

00:18:01.205 --> 00:18:03.374
I think my mother's
going to be okay!

00:18:03.416 --> 00:18:06.252
She's been eating a little more
and her strength is coming back!

00:18:06.294 --> 00:18:08.254
Really? That's wonderful!

00:18:08.296 --> 00:18:10.006
I told you she'd be all right.

00:18:10.047 --> 00:18:11.966
[SANE]
Mmm-hmm!

00:18:12.008 --> 00:18:13.634
Hey, Sane.

00:18:13.676 --> 00:18:16.012
I need to talk to you.

00:18:16.053 --> 00:18:18.598
It's important,
so listen carefully.

00:18:23.936 --> 00:18:24.854
[VILLAGER A]
Sane!

00:18:24.895 --> 00:18:26.272
The ritual Shinto
prayer is different

00:18:26.314 --> 00:18:27.857
from the one last year.

00:18:29.525 --> 00:18:30.401
Hey.

00:18:30.443 --> 00:18:33.487
Have you heard if anyone's
grown the <i>Mizuha</i> tooth yet?

00:18:33.529 --> 00:18:34.322
[VILLAGER E]
No.

00:18:34.363 --> 00:18:36.032
I've heard nothing.

00:18:36.073 --> 00:18:38.367
[VILLAGER D] Maybe this year's
crop wasn't a Parting Harvest

00:18:38.409 --> 00:18:39.452
after all.

00:18:39.493 --> 00:18:41.287
What do you think?

00:18:41.329 --> 00:18:42.413
[VILLAGER E]
Who knows?

00:18:42.455 --> 00:18:44.707
It could just be due
to all of our hard work.

00:18:46.876 --> 00:18:49.587
[SANE panting]

00:18:49.629 --> 00:18:54.967
[SANE crying]

00:18:59.972 --> 00:19:00.973
Hey.

00:19:02.892 --> 00:19:04.602
[SANE]
The festival.

00:19:04.644 --> 00:19:06.437
it seems to be going fine.

00:19:06.479 --> 00:19:08.481
Everyone is having a good time.

00:19:32.421 --> 00:19:34.799
[SANE]
Don't worry.

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.218
I'll do exactly
what you said to.

00:19:41.889 --> 00:19:43.557
[SANE]
Saishu...

00:19:43.599 --> 00:19:48.521
[SANE crying]

00:19:49.605 --> 00:19:50.815
[SANE]
Why?!

00:19:52.066 --> 00:19:54.694
Why does it have
to be this way?!

00:19:54.735 --> 00:19:56.404
[crying continues]

00:19:59.824 --> 00:20:02.159
Don't tell anyone what
I'm about to do here,

00:20:02.201 --> 00:20:03.536
you understand me?

00:20:06.038 --> 00:20:10.251
[GINKO] But there's one more
thing I'd like to ask you.

00:20:10.292 --> 00:20:13.963
I told you that the
<i>Koumyaku</i> is like life itself,

00:20:14.004 --> 00:20:16.882
but it alone
cannot revive a life.

00:20:16.924 --> 00:20:19.719
The one thing that can
do something like that

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:20.928
is that seed.

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:26.267
Now it's a risk,
but if that seed is consumed,

00:20:26.308 --> 00:20:29.520
it should be able to
revive living beings, too.

00:20:29.562 --> 00:20:32.356
But because of the differences
between you and a plant,

00:20:32.398 --> 00:20:35.651
the light pulse will probably
continue to live within you.

00:20:35.693 --> 00:20:39.071
If that happens,
you will no longer be human.

00:20:39.113 --> 00:20:42.074
You will become
an immortal being.

00:20:42.116 --> 00:20:43.826
Is that something
you can handle?

00:20:46.579 --> 00:20:50.583
[SAISHU] Isn't doing such a
thing forbidden by your kind?

00:20:50.624 --> 00:20:54.754
But since you're asking,
do you think you could do it?

00:20:54.795 --> 00:20:57.757
If you keep quiet about it,
no one will know.

00:20:57.798 --> 00:21:01.135
I'm not certain it would
work, and even if it did,

00:21:01.177 --> 00:21:03.971
I'm not sure if it would
be what's best for you.

00:21:04.013 --> 00:21:06.432
But, if you're willing to try...

00:21:06.474 --> 00:21:08.184
I opened those
old wounds of yours

00:21:08.225 --> 00:21:11.520
to find out what kind of
person you really are.

00:21:11.562 --> 00:21:14.440
I don't mind soiling my hands.

00:21:14.482 --> 00:21:15.733
Give it some thought.

00:21:18.068 --> 00:21:21.489
I don't think I'll need to.

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:23.991
I already know my answer.

00:21:29.288 --> 00:21:32.291
[SAISHU]
I want to watch over this land.

00:21:32.333 --> 00:21:37.713
The land of my forefathers.
And see it develop and grow.

00:21:51.393 --> 00:21:53.938
[SAISHU]
I need to know,

00:21:53.979 --> 00:21:59.610
with all that has happened,
if I did the right thing.

00:22:03.197 --> 00:22:06.200
[NARRATOR]
Thereafter, in that village,

00:22:06.242 --> 00:22:09.328
the story of that year's
harvest was passed down

00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:11.622
from generation to generation.

00:22:13.916 --> 00:22:16.627
As was another tale.

00:22:16.669 --> 00:22:18.838
A new legend had been born.

00:22:21.757 --> 00:22:24.844
In the year of the
last "Parting Harvest,"

00:22:24.885 --> 00:22:26.804
the rice was
responsible for bringing

00:22:26.846 --> 00:22:32.476
a dead man back to life,
and making him immortal.

00:22:32.518 --> 00:22:36.105
The ageless man would
wander around the country,

00:22:36.146 --> 00:22:38.482
returning to the village
from time to time

00:22:38.524 --> 00:22:42.111
to teach the people
new ways to enrich the soil

00:22:42.152 --> 00:22:43.863
and cultivate the land.

00:23:48.093 --> 00:23:51.764
Next: "The White Which Lives
Within The Inkstone."
