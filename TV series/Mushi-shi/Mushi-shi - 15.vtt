life energy of these creatures,

Well, the problem is,

I can't stay too
long in places

that are rich in <i>mushi</i>
without attracting them.

00:09:47.003 --> 00:09:50.340
And no good comes of having
too many <i>mushi</i> in one place.

00:09:50.381 --> 00:09:52.467
But judging from what

00:12:29.249 --> 00:12:30.500
[GINKO]
What's this?

00:12:37.632 --> 00:12:39.884
The <i>Harumagui...</i>

00:12:39.926 --> 00:12:41.552
Could it be?

00:12:45.223 --> 00:12:49.686
[MIHARU snores]

00:12:49.727 --> 00:12:51.312
[GINKO]
It's not your fault.

00:12:51.354 --> 00:12:53.231
He's gonna be all right.

00:12:53.273 --> 00:12:56.067
The symptoms are
the same as before.

00:12:56.109 --> 00:12:59.237
So, I'm sure he'll
wake up in the spring.

00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:00.488
[gasps]

00:13:02.782 --> 00:13:05.159
[GINKO] I'd like to stay
with you until then,

00:13:05.201 --> 00:13:07.537
but I've got to start moving.

00:13:07.578 --> 00:13:08.997
[gasps]
But you can't!

00:13:09.038 --> 00:13:12.041
Miharu will miss you
when he wakes up!

00:13:12.083 --> 00:13:13.668
I'm sorry, Suzu.

00:13:15.503 --> 00:13:18.464
[GINKO]
Wait for me... I'll be back.

00:13:34.188 --> 00:13:36.482
[NARRATOR]
When the real world awakens,

00:13:36.524 --> 00:13:39.319
the phantom world goes to sleep.

00:13:53.041 --> 00:13:55.626
[NARRATOR]
High in the winter mountains,

00:13:55.668 --> 00:13:59.422
a lone traveler senses
the coming of spring.

00:14:12.393 --> 00:14:14.645
Hey... Suzu.

00:14:16.147 --> 00:14:17.565
Ginko...

00:14:18.524 --> 00:14:19.525
[gasps]

00:14:24.906 --> 00:14:28.576
[GINKO]
Wait. He's still asleep?

00:14:28.618 --> 00:14:30.620
But it's been a year!

00:14:30.661 --> 00:14:31.788
I know.

00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:34.332
I've been at my wits' end
trying to understand.

00:14:34.374 --> 00:14:36.334
What could have gone wrong?

00:14:38.461 --> 00:14:40.588
[GINKO]
There's one chance.

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:42.423
I've got to find the
place on the mountain

00:14:42.465 --> 00:14:44.175
where those greens came from.

00:14:44.217 --> 00:14:45.927
You mustn't,
it's too dangerous!

00:14:45.968 --> 00:14:48.513
You could end up
just like Miharu!

00:14:48.554 --> 00:14:51.599
Miharu should've woken up
in the spring, shouldn't he?

00:14:51.641 --> 00:14:54.060
Whatever used to wake
him up is missing.

00:14:54.102 --> 00:14:56.104
I've got to go find it.

00:14:57.647 --> 00:14:59.232
If I don't come back,

00:14:59.273 --> 00:15:01.692
have them search the
north side of the mountain.

00:15:19.168 --> 00:15:20.420
[GINKO]
Let's see...

00:15:20.461 --> 00:15:23.756
Last year his footprints
headed off in this direction.

00:15:29.554 --> 00:15:34.350
[GINKO pants]

00:15:34.392 --> 00:15:35.601
[GINKO]
Damn.

00:15:38.855 --> 00:15:40.815
Where the hell is this place?

00:15:45.153 --> 00:15:46.904
[GINKO]
A butterfly?

00:15:46.946 --> 00:15:48.739
That was in Miharu's wrap!

00:15:55.413 --> 00:15:57.915
[GINKO]
That sweet scent...

00:15:57.957 --> 00:15:59.959
Ah! That way!

00:16:24.442 --> 00:16:26.819
The air in this place...

00:16:26.861 --> 00:16:28.779
I'm starting to
get light-headed.

00:16:31.032 --> 00:16:33.242
[GINKO] I better not
stay here too long.

00:16:33.284 --> 00:16:38.789
Okay, <i>usobuki</i> take the form
of tree blossoms, so...

00:16:38.831 --> 00:16:40.041
...Huh.

00:16:41.542 --> 00:16:45.004
[GINKO] Damn. They all look
like ordinary blossoms.

00:16:46.589 --> 00:16:48.382
[GINKO]
There's got to be something.

00:16:48.424 --> 00:16:50.051
Some clue.

00:16:57.892 --> 00:17:00.228
[GINKO] Its body
temperature is dropping.

00:17:06.275 --> 00:17:09.445
[GINKO]
The scent. It's changing.

00:17:13.699 --> 00:17:15.660
[GINKO]
What is this?

00:17:15.701 --> 00:17:19.247
My body's... getting colder.

00:17:19.288 --> 00:17:22.542
I can't... move my hand.

00:17:26.254 --> 00:17:28.464
[gasps]

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:34.136
[GINKO grunts]
Why are those butterflies

00:17:34.178 --> 00:17:36.347
the only things still...?

00:17:36.389 --> 00:17:37.390
[GINKO grunts]

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:44.438
This is a...

00:17:46.732 --> 00:17:49.527
I've been such a blind idiot.

00:17:52.738 --> 00:17:54.615
[GINKO]
Now I get it.

00:17:54.657 --> 00:17:57.159
But I'm so sleepy.

00:17:57.201 --> 00:17:58.911
I can't...

00:18:32.903 --> 00:18:34.488
[SUZU]
You fool.

00:18:36.324 --> 00:18:38.993
[SUZU]
You stupid, stupid fool.

00:18:40.536 --> 00:18:42.788
What do I do?

00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:44.165
What now?

00:18:44.206 --> 00:18:46.500
I don't know how to wake you up!

00:18:48.669 --> 00:18:53.674
[SUZU sobs]

00:19:01.557 --> 00:19:02.767
What's that?

00:19:13.069 --> 00:19:15.905
That was strange.

00:19:15.946 --> 00:19:18.949
It seemed as if
something flew out.

00:19:23.663 --> 00:19:28.626
[shuffling]

00:19:36.509 --> 00:19:38.678
[GINKO]
What's that?

00:19:38.719 --> 00:19:40.680
That scent...

00:19:40.721 --> 00:19:42.306
Oh.

00:19:42.348 --> 00:19:44.558
It must be spring.

00:19:56.946 --> 00:19:59.615
[GINKO]
What's that? Up there?

00:19:59.657 --> 00:20:02.284
Y-You're awake!

00:20:02.326 --> 00:20:04.662
[gasps]
Miharu!

00:20:06.288 --> 00:20:08.416
[SUZU]
Miharu?! Miha--

00:20:08.457 --> 00:20:09.667
[MIHARU grunst]

00:20:09.709 --> 00:20:11.293
[gasps]

00:20:16.382 --> 00:20:18.426
[MIHARU]
Sis?

00:20:24.348 --> 00:20:25.808
[GINKO] After the
flower-like creature

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:28.144
on the ceiling released
its fragrance,

00:20:28.185 --> 00:20:30.563
it changed into
something else.

00:20:30.604 --> 00:20:32.606
Something I recognized.

00:20:35.609 --> 00:20:37.445
[GINKO] The thing I first
thought was a chrysalis

00:20:37.486 --> 00:20:39.905
was actually an <i>usobuki.</i>

00:20:39.947 --> 00:20:42.783
So, it seems the
<i>usobuki's</i> metamorphosis

00:20:42.825 --> 00:20:45.995
somehow signals the end of
the <i>Harumagui,</i> is that it?

00:20:46.036 --> 00:20:47.371
[MIHARU]
Mm-hm.

00:20:47.413 --> 00:20:49.957
If you hadn't set that
butterfly free by accident,

00:20:49.999 --> 00:20:52.835
it would've turned into a flower
in the spring and woken me up.

00:20:52.877 --> 00:20:55.045
It would've helped if you'd
told me that right away.

00:20:55.087 --> 00:20:58.257
I know, but I liked the
butterflies the best.

00:20:58.299 --> 00:21:00.634
I wanted to keep them a secret.

00:21:02.595 --> 00:21:03.679
[MIHARU]
They grew those greens

00:21:03.721 --> 00:21:06.557
that helped us
out in the winter.

00:21:06.599 --> 00:21:10.853
and they looked so beautiful,
flying around in the snow.

00:21:10.895 --> 00:21:13.856
But they... they were just doing
what they had to do to survive,

00:21:13.898 --> 00:21:16.150
not to help us, weren't they?

00:21:18.986 --> 00:21:19.779
That's right.

00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:21.781
You're starting to catch on.

00:21:21.822 --> 00:21:25.409
See... the <i>mushi</i> aren't
really our friends at all.

00:21:25.451 --> 00:21:28.037
More like unusual neighbors.

00:21:28.078 --> 00:21:30.372
You can never
really trust them.

00:21:32.124 --> 00:21:35.753
[GINKO] But, you're perfectly
free to like them.

00:21:39.131 --> 00:21:40.508
Thanks.

00:21:42.051 --> 00:21:46.263
[MIHARU] Hey. You wanna come
by the house before you go?

00:21:46.305 --> 00:21:49.892
Thanks, but I've stayed
here too long as it is.

00:21:49.934 --> 00:21:53.020
I need to get moving again.

00:21:53.062 --> 00:21:54.188
Okay.

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:57.191
But Sis is gonna miss you.

00:21:57.233 --> 00:22:00.736
Make sure you tell her I said
thank you for everything.

00:22:05.115 --> 00:22:08.744
[MIHARU] Hey! You will come
back sometime, won't you?

00:22:11.121 --> 00:22:12.081
Maybe.

00:22:12.122 --> 00:22:14.834
Only next time it won't
be in the winter.

00:22:16.001 --> 00:22:17.628
Why wouldn't it?

00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:19.046
[GINKO] Because people
shouldn't let themselves

00:22:19.088 --> 00:22:21.340
get weak that time of year.

00:22:27.346 --> 00:22:29.473
[NARRATOR] The beginning
of a fleeting spring

00:22:29.515 --> 00:22:33.227
stirs the air in
the icy mountains.

00:22:33.269 --> 00:22:36.564
The glow from the home
along the snowy path

00:22:36.605 --> 00:22:38.816
invites all creatures,

00:22:38.858 --> 00:22:42.695
beasts, <i>mushi</i>
and humans alike,

00:22:42.736 --> 00:22:46.782
to seek a respite
from their wanderings.

00:23:48.969 --> 00:23:51.805
