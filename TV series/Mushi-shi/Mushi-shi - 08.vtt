wholesaler for quite some time.

three years ago, I think.

00:12:54.857 --> 00:12:56.734
Remember that?

00:12:56.776 --> 00:12:57.819
[FISHERMAN 5]
Yeah.

00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:00.863
And there was a fog on the
water, just like this one.

00:13:00.905 --> 00:13:02.949
I think we all need to
hold off on the fishing

00:13:02.991 --> 00:13:04.784
until this passes.

00:13:04.826 --> 00:13:07.412
They say that the people that
go out to sea in this fog

00:13:07.453 --> 00:13:10.665
are never heard from again.

00:13:10.707 --> 00:13:12.750
And after about three years,

00:13:12.792 --> 00:13:16.004
their boats return
with no one on board.

00:13:26.597 --> 00:13:30.560
The boats return,
but they're empty.

00:13:34.439 --> 00:13:35.982
[SHIRO]
No waves.

00:13:36.024 --> 00:13:39.777
Even if the boat did come back,
it would never make it to shore.

00:13:42.864 --> 00:13:45.825
[GINKO] So it does
bother you, doesn't it?

00:13:45.867 --> 00:13:47.327
[SHIRO]
You...

00:13:47.368 --> 00:13:50.163
[GINKO] That story you told me
was very intriguing.

00:13:50.204 --> 00:13:53.374
So after I left,
I researched it.

00:13:53.416 --> 00:13:54.792
From that research,

00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:57.337
I've learned that the boat
should return with the fog,

00:13:57.378 --> 00:14:00.089
so I came back to see
if it was true.

00:14:00.131 --> 00:14:03.301
That mass of snakes you saw...
No one else could see them

00:14:03.343 --> 00:14:06.679
besides you and
your wife, right?

00:14:06.721 --> 00:14:08.848
Yes. That's right.

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:10.391
[GINKO]
I thought so.

00:14:10.433 --> 00:14:13.102
Those snakes...
were most likely <i>mushi</i>.

00:14:15.438 --> 00:14:18.024
[GINKO] You've heard of
<i>Umisen-yamasen</i>, right?

00:14:18.066 --> 00:14:21.194
It's the idea that if a snake
lives 1,000 years in the sea

00:14:21.235 --> 00:14:23.154
and then 1,000 years
in the mountains,

00:14:23.196 --> 00:14:24.989
it will become a dragon.

00:14:25.031 --> 00:14:27.450
This story is connected
with what you saw.

00:14:27.492 --> 00:14:29.077
Of course, there's no way
to tell how long

00:14:29.118 --> 00:14:30.703
they've actually lived.

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:35.041
[GINKO] They are divided
into two groups:

00:14:35.083 --> 00:14:37.210
The ones that mass
together in the open sea,

00:14:37.251 --> 00:14:39.837
creating a fog-like haze.

00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:43.091
And the ones that live quietly,
deep in the mountains.

00:14:43.132 --> 00:14:46.677
At a glance, they both
resemble a snake.

00:14:46.719 --> 00:14:48.012
When the time comes,

00:14:48.054 --> 00:14:50.681
the <i>mushi</i> from the mountains
descend down to the sea,

00:14:50.723 --> 00:14:53.101
and the <i>mushi</i> from the water
move closer to land.

00:14:53.142 --> 00:14:55.144
They meet just offshore.

00:14:55.186 --> 00:14:58.439
1,000 days later, they return
to their deep-sea home

00:14:58.481 --> 00:15:00.817
to become one single <i>mushi</i>.

00:15:00.858 --> 00:15:02.235
So you're saying...

00:15:02.276 --> 00:15:04.153
That those same things
I saw before

00:15:04.195 --> 00:15:06.280
when I lost my wife
have returned?

00:15:09.909 --> 00:15:11.035
[SHIRO]
I'm going out there.

00:15:11.077 --> 00:15:12.120
[GINKO]
Wait...

00:15:12.161 --> 00:15:15.415
It's all right.
I'll be fine.

00:15:15.456 --> 00:15:17.834
I know you can't
see into this fog.

00:15:17.875 --> 00:15:21.587
But oddly enough, you can see
out of it clear as day.

00:15:21.629 --> 00:15:24.590
Your wife.
She couldn't see.

00:15:24.632 --> 00:15:28.386
Have you ever wondered why she
was the one the fog claimed

00:15:28.428 --> 00:15:31.973
while you made it back?

00:15:32.014 --> 00:15:34.183
[GINKO] Only those who
want to return to land

00:15:34.225 --> 00:15:38.396
can see the shore
from inside the fog.

00:15:38.438 --> 00:15:39.814
She didn't.

00:15:42.775 --> 00:15:44.485
The last time I saw you,

00:15:44.527 --> 00:15:48.239
It seemed like you might lose
your desire to go on living

00:15:48.281 --> 00:15:50.867
if your wife's belongings
washed up on the shore.

00:15:55.496 --> 00:15:57.415
Maybe then, but not now.

00:15:59.083 --> 00:16:00.460
So it would seem...

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:05.173
[GINKO]
Well...

00:16:05.214 --> 00:16:07.717
Now that you fully comprehend
what we're dealing with,

00:16:07.758 --> 00:16:10.011
I won't stop you
if you want to join me.

00:16:10.052 --> 00:16:12.722
I'm going out there
to satisfy my curiosity.

00:16:15.475 --> 00:16:18.144
[GINKO] If so, be prepared
for the worst.

00:16:19.729 --> 00:16:20.771
[SHIRO]
Right.

00:16:25.318 --> 00:16:27.278
[GINKO]
Looks like you were right.

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:29.822
It's almost uncanny how clearly
you can see the shore

00:16:29.864 --> 00:16:31.407
from inside this fog.

00:16:39.415 --> 00:16:42.376
[GINKO]
You can still see it, right?

00:16:42.418 --> 00:16:43.961
[SHIRO]
I can see it.

00:16:48.466 --> 00:16:49.675
They're here.

00:17:02.104 --> 00:17:04.815
There's so many of them.

00:17:04.857 --> 00:17:07.860
[cracking noise]

00:17:20.122 --> 00:17:23.417
There it is.
The boat she was on.

00:17:30.675 --> 00:17:33.970
It looks like...
her body's still in it.

00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:41.811
[SHIRO] I'll be all right.
Pull up alongside.

00:18:29.066 --> 00:18:30.067
Shiro?

00:18:33.613 --> 00:18:37.158
Michihi? You're all right?

00:18:38.993 --> 00:18:40.369
[GINKO]
What's going on?

00:18:41.704 --> 00:18:45.124
Shiro...
I'd given up on you.

00:18:45.166 --> 00:18:47.668
Tell me...
What took you so long?

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:50.171
It feels like I've
been out here for days.

00:18:50.212 --> 00:18:54.133
For... For three days, at least!

00:18:54.175 --> 00:18:55.760
[SHIRO]
Three days?

00:19:00.556 --> 00:19:02.808
[SHIRO]
I don't understand.

00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:04.518
What's going on?

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:10.566
[SHIRO crying]

00:19:10.608 --> 00:19:14.153
[SHIRO]
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

00:19:14.195 --> 00:19:16.739
I said some
horrible things to you.

00:19:16.781 --> 00:19:18.699
[MICHIHI]
Yes. It hurt.

00:19:18.741 --> 00:19:20.868
You were being so cruel.

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:22.453
But it's all right.

00:19:22.495 --> 00:19:24.914
Now you've come to rescue me.

00:19:24.955 --> 00:19:27.416
I'm sorry I complained so much.

00:19:27.458 --> 00:19:31.295
Really... I didn't
mean to anger you.

00:19:31.337 --> 00:19:32.838
I want to see your home.

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:34.548
Will you take me?

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:36.342
[SHIRO]
Of course I will.

00:19:36.384 --> 00:19:38.511
Come on. Let's go.

00:19:38.552 --> 00:19:40.930
Get on board.

00:19:40.971 --> 00:19:42.056
[GINKO]
Wait...

00:19:44.433 --> 00:19:45.685
The shore.

00:19:45.726 --> 00:19:48.521
Tell me. Can you still see it?

00:19:48.562 --> 00:19:50.064
Of course I can.

00:19:50.106 --> 00:19:52.108
It's as clear as day.

00:19:52.149 --> 00:19:54.610
Look... It's this way.

00:19:56.612 --> 00:19:58.364
It's time to go.

00:19:58.406 --> 00:20:03.369
The place where we
came from is there.

00:20:03.411 --> 00:20:05.746
That is no longer human.

00:20:06.872 --> 00:20:09.458
The <i>mushi</i> are transforming.

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:10.960
It's not safe here.

00:20:12.461 --> 00:20:15.089
Step away from that thing.
Right now.

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:17.425
[MICHIHI]
Shiro?

00:20:17.466 --> 00:20:20.469
[bubbling noise]

00:20:41.741 --> 00:20:44.744
[FISHERMAN 7]
Hey! Any sign of them?

00:20:44.785 --> 00:20:46.579
[FISHERMAN 8]
No. None.

00:20:48.205 --> 00:20:50.166
[FISHERMAN 2]
It might be too late.

00:20:52.126 --> 00:20:54.628
Hey! A giant wave's coming!

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:55.796
Hang on!

00:21:01.343 --> 00:21:04.138
[FISHERMAN 2] It looks like the
fog is beginning to clear up.

00:21:12.772 --> 00:21:14.940
[GINKO] By the time
we got back to shore,

00:21:14.982 --> 00:21:18.819
the villagers had long since
lost all hope for our survival.

00:21:20.154 --> 00:21:21.614
[GINKO] It felt like
we had been out to sea

00:21:21.655 --> 00:21:23.282
for only two or three hours.

00:21:23.324 --> 00:21:26.368
[NAMI]
Shiro! You're alive!

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:29.288
[GINKO] But on the shore,
over a month had passed.

00:21:40.424 --> 00:21:42.676
[GINKO] Inside the fog,
we were most likely

00:21:42.718 --> 00:21:45.179
on the <i>mushi</i>'s frame of time.

00:21:45.221 --> 00:21:47.348
That's the one consolation.

00:21:47.389 --> 00:21:50.684
She only had to endure
three days of loneliness.

00:21:55.022 --> 00:21:56.023
Yeah.

00:21:58.275 --> 00:21:59.610
I'm sure you're right.

00:22:04.824 --> 00:22:07.117
[GINKO] The next day,
his wife's boat

00:22:07.159 --> 00:22:10.287
and all of her belongings
washed up on the shore.

00:22:12.039 --> 00:22:15.084
These clothes
are so beautiful!

00:22:15.125 --> 00:22:18.045
[GINKO]
Is this okay with you?

00:22:18.087 --> 00:22:21.257
[SHIRO]
Yeah. It's okay.

00:22:22.716 --> 00:22:24.927
The owner isn't coming back.

00:22:29.598 --> 00:22:30.933
[NAMI]
Shiro!

00:22:34.311 --> 00:22:37.565
[NAMI]
Look! Look what I found!

00:22:37.606 --> 00:22:40.693
[SHIRO]
Yes. It's very pretty.

00:23:48.802 --> 00:23:51.388
[NARRATOR]
Next: "The Heavy Seed."
