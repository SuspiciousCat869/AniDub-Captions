[FUKI] There. I think.
It went that way.

00:12:47.892 --> 00:12:51.813
I thought she was imagining it,
just like everyone else.

00:12:51.854 --> 00:12:54.440
She wasn't.
It's a <i>tenpengusa</i>.

00:12:54.482 --> 00:12:56.109
Huh?

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:59.070
A <i>mushi</i> that lives
high up in the sky.

00:12:59.112 --> 00:13:00.446
<i>Mushi</i>?

00:13:00.488 --> 00:13:02.657
[GINKO]
Yes.

00:13:02.699 --> 00:13:06.035
They're born from darkness,
and they gather in the gloom

00:13:06.077 --> 00:13:08.037
at the borders
with the light.

00:13:08.079 --> 00:13:10.999
Fuki said she could
see them in the shadows

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:15.044
or floating in the air
like particles of dust.

00:13:15.086 --> 00:13:18.172
Very few have
the gift of seeing them,

00:13:18.214 --> 00:13:22.385
but they exist
in every corner of our world.

00:13:22.427 --> 00:13:24.762
And you can see
the same things Fuki does?

00:13:24.804 --> 00:13:28.433
[GINKO] I can. In fact,
it's how I make my living.

00:13:30.184 --> 00:13:34.230
You know... I envy you.

00:13:34.272 --> 00:13:37.525
Do you?
Careful what you wish for.

00:13:37.567 --> 00:13:39.485
Fuki was a lucky woman,

00:13:39.527 --> 00:13:41.362
but she's still under
the <i>mushi</i>'s influence

00:13:41.404 --> 00:13:45.366
and could be in great danger.

00:13:45.408 --> 00:13:48.244
The <i>tenpengusa</i> appears
as a balloon-like object

00:13:48.286 --> 00:13:51.414
with a tail that floats through
the sky above the Komyaku:

00:13:51.456 --> 00:13:54.208
the underground river of light.

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:57.378
It feeds on other
luminescent airborne <i>mushi</i>.

00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:01.299
At night, it resembles a comet
drifting through the heavens.

00:14:01.341 --> 00:14:03.760
Because of this,
these <i>mushi</i> have also

00:14:03.801 --> 00:14:06.596
been called
"The Wayward Stars."

00:14:08.181 --> 00:14:10.558
[FUKI] It went that way.
It sort of zig-zagged

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.019
and flickered on
and off as it moved.

00:14:15.313 --> 00:14:18.900
[GINKO] Occasionally, when there
isn't enough food in the sky,

00:14:18.941 --> 00:14:21.110
the <i>tenpengusa</i> will
extend a tendril down

00:14:21.152 --> 00:14:23.237
near the ground
like a fishing line.

00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:25.156
It looks like a string.

00:14:25.198 --> 00:14:28.618
When an animal touches it,
it's pulled skyward.

00:14:28.659 --> 00:14:32.372
If it's too large to swallow,
the <i>mushi</i> spits it out

00:14:32.413 --> 00:14:34.540
and it falls back to the ground.

00:14:37.543 --> 00:14:39.545
Usually, the intended
victim is killed

00:14:39.587 --> 00:14:41.631
when it strikes the earth.

00:14:41.672 --> 00:14:43.633
Fuki was lucky.
She landed in a tree

00:14:43.674 --> 00:14:45.510
and it cushioned her fall.

00:14:45.551 --> 00:14:49.472
But, because she was
almost swallowed,

00:14:49.514 --> 00:14:53.059
she is still deeply
under the <i>mushi</i>'s influence.

00:14:53.101 --> 00:14:54.519
That's why
you couldn't find her

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.479
when you searched the mountains.

00:14:56.521 --> 00:15:00.566
She'd turned into something the
normal human eye couldn't see.

00:15:02.026 --> 00:15:03.861
I've been giving her
this medicine

00:15:03.903 --> 00:15:07.949
and it's helped a lot,
but she's still not cured.

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:09.951
That string in her hand
binds her to the sky,

00:15:09.992 --> 00:15:12.912
trapping her between
our world and the <i>mushi</i>'s.

00:15:12.954 --> 00:15:15.623
[GINKO]
Her condition is delicate.

00:15:15.665 --> 00:15:17.083
She needs more than
this medicine

00:15:17.125 --> 00:15:19.836
to be normal once again.

00:15:19.877 --> 00:15:22.755
She has to <i>want</i> to be normal.

00:15:22.797 --> 00:15:24.549
Her desire to be human
must be stronger

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:26.426
than the pull of that string.

00:15:28.094 --> 00:15:31.973
It's up to you
to make her feel that way.

00:15:32.014 --> 00:15:36.060
Or... you could just tell
me to mind my own business.

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:41.482
No. I'll take your advice.

00:15:42.567 --> 00:15:45.278
[SEIJIRO] Are you sure
you can't stay longer?

00:15:45.319 --> 00:15:48.990
[GINKO] Thanks, but it's past
time for me to be moving on.

00:15:49.031 --> 00:15:50.908
Well, please be sure
to stay in touch

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:53.244
because we'll be
having our wedding soon.

00:15:53.286 --> 00:15:55.329
We'd be very honored
if you'd attend.

00:15:55.371 --> 00:15:58.833
[GINKO] Me? That's very kind,
but you don't have to.

00:15:58.875 --> 00:16:03.171
Please. You made the
whole thing possible, Ginko.

00:16:03.212 --> 00:16:08.468
All right then. Fine.
If you insist, I'll stop by.

00:16:10.636 --> 00:16:16.476
[GINKO] Soon after...
I received a letter.

00:16:26.486 --> 00:16:28.154
[GINKO]
It was from Seijiro.

00:16:28.196 --> 00:16:32.241
He was desperate.
Fuki had disappeared again.

00:16:33.326 --> 00:16:36.579
[GINKO] What happened?
What went wrong?

00:16:36.621 --> 00:16:39.832
[SEIJIRO]
Ginko, thank goodness.

00:16:39.874 --> 00:16:42.710
No matter how many
times I implored him,

00:16:42.752 --> 00:16:46.714
my father wouldn't
give us his blessing.

00:16:46.756 --> 00:16:49.842
I begged him to change
his mind everyday.

00:16:49.884 --> 00:16:54.931
The longer it dragged on,
the more miserable Fuki became.

00:16:54.972 --> 00:16:58.351
At the same time,
Fuki's body seemed

00:16:58.392 --> 00:17:01.771
to grow lighter until
even the slightest breeze

00:17:01.812 --> 00:17:04.190
would send her
floating up into the air.

00:17:04.232 --> 00:17:07.610
Soon, she was unable
to stay on the ground

00:17:07.652 --> 00:17:09.904
no matter what she did.

00:17:09.946 --> 00:17:13.032
Fuki, you've got to
come down from there!

00:17:13.074 --> 00:17:16.202
I'm trying, I swear to you,
but I don't know how!

00:17:16.244 --> 00:17:17.578
Listen to me, please.

00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:20.331
I'm sure Father
will come around soon,

00:17:20.373 --> 00:17:22.583
but if he sees you like this...

00:17:22.625 --> 00:17:27.505
I'm sorry, but I can't
control it. It just happens!

00:17:29.715 --> 00:17:31.801
All right, now just stay there.

00:17:31.842 --> 00:17:34.136
I've got to go
and get your medicine.

00:17:34.178 --> 00:17:35.972
I will.

00:17:38.432 --> 00:17:40.476
[SEIJIRO]
Then... one day...

00:17:42.061 --> 00:17:44.981
[gasps]

00:17:45.022 --> 00:17:48.818
Fuki! Fuki?!

00:17:48.859 --> 00:17:53.155
She was gone.
I haven't seen her since.

00:17:53.197 --> 00:17:55.032
Didn't I tell you...

00:17:55.074 --> 00:17:57.660
...you had to hold on to her
and make her feel human?

00:17:57.702 --> 00:17:59.453
I tell you, I tried!

00:17:59.495 --> 00:18:03.332
I wanted my family
to accept her. I did!

00:18:03.374 --> 00:18:06.794
But... the way she was,
I couldn't.

00:18:06.836 --> 00:18:09.297
And there's the problem.

00:18:09.338 --> 00:18:13.301
<i>You</i> couldn't bring yourself
to accept her, could you?

00:18:13.342 --> 00:18:19.348
And because of your rejection,
Fuki's human form faded away.

00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:23.269
Faded... away?

00:18:23.311 --> 00:18:27.773
She's still here, you just
can't see her anymore.

00:18:31.861 --> 00:18:33.529
That's just ridiculous.

00:18:33.571 --> 00:18:34.989
If you don't want to
lose her forever,

00:18:35.031 --> 00:18:38.034
you must accept her
the way she is.

00:18:38.075 --> 00:18:42.163
[SEIJIRO] Accept her?
I can't even see her!

00:18:42.204 --> 00:18:45.458
So... how...?

00:18:45.499 --> 00:18:48.169
You're the only
chance she has left.

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:53.591
Listen. Right now,
you are all that ties her

00:18:53.633 --> 00:18:58.095
to our world, but just barely.

00:19:09.774 --> 00:19:14.862
I don't... I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

00:19:16.781 --> 00:19:18.908
[SEIJIRO]
Fuki.

00:19:18.949 --> 00:19:21.410
[FUKI] Master Seijiro,
why do you always

00:19:21.452 --> 00:19:25.414
spend so much time
looking at the stars?

00:19:25.456 --> 00:19:28.918
[SEIJIRO]
Hmm. I'm not sure I know.

00:19:28.959 --> 00:19:31.545
I guess because no matter
how crazy the day is,

00:19:31.587 --> 00:19:33.464
or what my worries are,

00:19:33.506 --> 00:19:35.716
the stars are
always there at night.

00:19:35.758 --> 00:19:37.426
They never let me down.

00:19:37.468 --> 00:19:40.763
I find that very comforting
for some reason.

00:19:40.805 --> 00:19:44.183
I understand. When the
little mistress is crying

00:19:44.225 --> 00:19:46.394
and won't stop and I feel down,

00:19:46.435 --> 00:19:50.564
I take my mind off it
by counting the stars.

00:19:50.606 --> 00:19:54.568
That's why I feel so lonely
when the sun comes up.

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:58.698
One by one the stars vanish.

00:19:58.739 --> 00:20:03.536
Before you know it,
there isn't a single one left.

00:20:05.705 --> 00:20:08.416
It's sad.
Where do the stars all go

00:20:08.457 --> 00:20:10.918
during the daytime, I wonder?

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:13.879
That's silly, Fuki.
The stars don't go anywhere.

00:20:13.921 --> 00:20:16.424
They're still
right there in the sky.

00:20:16.465 --> 00:20:17.925
Are you sure?

00:20:17.967 --> 00:20:19.468
Of course I am.

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:22.388
The sunlight's far too strong
for us to see them, but...

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:25.057
...they're up there,
the same as they are at night.

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:33.315
[FUKI]
So they don't go anywhere.

00:20:33.357 --> 00:20:38.279
Even though
we can't see them...

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:41.323
...they're still
up there shining for us.

00:20:47.955 --> 00:20:49.457
[SEIJIRO]
Fuki...

00:20:55.421 --> 00:20:57.548
[GINKO] No one in the village
had ever seen anything

00:20:57.590 --> 00:21:00.634
quite like it before.

00:21:00.676 --> 00:21:06.432
A hastily-arranged wedding
with a groom, but no bride.

00:21:06.474 --> 00:21:09.185
What's more,
the groom behaved as if

00:21:09.226 --> 00:21:13.522
there was nothing unusual, and
his new wife was by his side.

00:21:13.564 --> 00:21:16.025
Or maybe you're over here.

00:21:16.066 --> 00:21:19.153
[GINKO] Needless to say, his
behavior quickly led people

00:21:19.195 --> 00:21:22.823
to gossip that
he had lost his mind.

00:21:28.078 --> 00:21:31.290
[GINKO]
Then soon after,

00:21:31.332 --> 00:21:35.294
he set up house alone
on the edge of the village.

00:21:37.546 --> 00:21:41.133
As always, he continued
to talk with his absent wife

00:21:41.175 --> 00:21:43.552
as if she was still there.

00:21:43.594 --> 00:21:45.971
Eventually, the villagers
got used to it

00:21:46.013 --> 00:21:48.599
and stopped coming by to gawk.

00:21:53.896 --> 00:21:57.483
But, as time passed...

00:21:57.525 --> 00:21:59.151
[FUKI]
Seijiro...

00:22:03.489 --> 00:22:06.408
Hey. That girl. Isn't that...?

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:11.330
[gasps] That's Fuki!
When did she come back?

00:22:12.998 --> 00:22:16.126
[GINKO]
Soon, everyone could see Fuki.

00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:22.842
From then on,
they say Fuki remained

00:22:22.883 --> 00:22:24.927
by her husband's side.

00:22:24.969 --> 00:22:27.721
Her mysterious
disappearances ceased

00:22:27.763 --> 00:22:30.140
and were eventually forgotten.

00:23:48.385 --> 00:23:50.763
