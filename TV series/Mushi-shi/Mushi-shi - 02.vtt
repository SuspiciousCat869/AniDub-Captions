About six months ago,

couldn't help her with
her condition, could they?

00:13:06.119 --> 00:13:07.745
But I think I can.

00:13:07.787 --> 00:13:09.664
[gasps] Are you telling me...

00:13:09.706 --> 00:13:10.915
You can cure my son?

00:13:11.791 --> 00:13:13.918
Well, since he was
so recently infected,

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:16.254
the medicine alone
should be enough.

00:13:16.296 --> 00:13:17.547
And if we're lucky,

00:13:17.588 --> 00:13:20.633
a few hours' sleep and
he'll be as good as new.

00:13:25.513 --> 00:13:30.435
[fluttering]

00:13:30.476 --> 00:13:31.936
[SUI]
Biki...

00:13:34.981 --> 00:13:36.441
[SUI]
Biki...

00:13:39.068 --> 00:13:40.987
[SUI]
Biki...

00:13:45.908 --> 00:13:48.036
[SUI]
I'm sorry...

00:13:49.287 --> 00:13:51.789
[SUI]
I'm sorry...

00:13:51.831 --> 00:13:53.583
I'm sorry!

00:13:53.624 --> 00:13:55.126
[BIKI]
Sui!

00:14:02.675 --> 00:14:04.052
[GINKO]
So, you're awake.

00:14:04.093 --> 00:14:05.094
[BIKI]
Huh?

00:14:07.722 --> 00:14:09.682
Are your eyes
still bothering you?

00:14:11.184 --> 00:14:12.185
[BIKI]
Uh-uh.

00:14:13.186 --> 00:14:15.396
Good... Then it worked.

00:14:17.065 --> 00:14:18.816
[GINKO]
The cause of Sui's illness is

00:14:18.858 --> 00:14:21.652
the darkness of <i>manakomushi.</i>

00:14:21.694 --> 00:14:23.738
They multiply in the dark.

00:14:26.574 --> 00:14:30.578
You spent too much time
with Sui out in that shed.

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:32.914
Wait... You mean you know Sui?

00:14:34.707 --> 00:14:36.793
[BIKI]
Could he be the one?

00:14:36.834 --> 00:14:39.379
Whenever I close
my second eyelid...

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:41.964
She's there by the river...

00:14:42.006 --> 00:14:43.674
[BIKI gasps]

00:14:43.716 --> 00:14:45.176
[GINKO]
The light that river gives off

00:14:45.218 --> 00:14:48.096
is very different from
ordinary earthlight.

00:14:48.137 --> 00:14:52.183
It can poison the eye if
you look at it too closely.

00:14:52.225 --> 00:14:54.602
[BIKI]
No, he has both of his eyes...

00:14:54.644 --> 00:14:57.313
He can't be the one-eyed
man Sui told me about.

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:03.611
I'll begin Sui's treatment
tonight, after the sun sets.

00:15:07.198 --> 00:15:08.199
[BIKI]
Okay...

00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:16.916
[door creaks]

00:15:27.468 --> 00:15:28.469
[GINKO gasps]

00:15:31.305 --> 00:15:33.474
Sui...

00:15:33.516 --> 00:15:35.643
No, you didn't...

00:15:35.685 --> 00:15:38.604
Dammit, I told you not
to go into the river.

00:15:43.943 --> 00:15:48.865
[door creaks]

00:15:54.579 --> 00:15:56.080
Oh, Sui...

00:16:11.929 --> 00:16:14.932
Sui's eyeballs are both dead.

00:16:14.974 --> 00:16:15.933
[BIKI gasps]

00:16:15.975 --> 00:16:19.103
But I'll try to do
something for her if I can.

00:16:19.187 --> 00:16:21.522
If you close your second
eyelid for too long...

00:16:21.564 --> 00:16:24.817
Eventually, your eyeballs are
consumed by the darkness.

00:16:27.236 --> 00:16:29.113
[GINKO]
Are you ready, Sui?

00:16:29.155 --> 00:16:32.366
We're going to use the moonlight
to chase out the <i>mushi.</i>

00:16:32.408 --> 00:16:35.536
Now, keep your second
eyelid closed...

00:16:35.578 --> 00:16:37.914
And slowly, open your eyes.

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:02.188
That's right, come on out.

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:04.357
There's light out here, <i>mushi.</i>

00:17:25.836 --> 00:17:27.421
[BIKI gasps]

00:17:39.141 --> 00:17:40.142
[GINKO]
There!

00:17:41.936 --> 00:17:44.564
Sui! Now! Close your
eyes! Quickly!

00:18:11.048 --> 00:18:13.009
[GINKO]
That should do it.

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:17.555
Now then... let's see what
we can do about her eyes.

00:18:17.597 --> 00:18:19.223
Those were <i>mushi!</i>

00:18:19.265 --> 00:18:20.891
She was telling me
the truth all along!

00:18:20.933 --> 00:18:22.768
There really were
<i>mushi</i> in there!

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:26.731
[GINKO] Her eyes have
been completely devoured.

00:18:26.772 --> 00:18:29.400
I don't know if this
will work, but...

00:18:31.193 --> 00:18:32.737
[BIKI gasps]

00:18:36.324 --> 00:18:38.117
[GINKO]
I'll try giving her this.

00:18:38.159 --> 00:18:39.619
[BIKI gasping]

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:42.079
[GINKO] You know, you can
stop freaking out now.

00:18:42.121 --> 00:18:44.290
You're gonna faint
if you're not careful.

00:18:44.332 --> 00:18:46.334
Come on, it's just a glass eye.

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:48.836
[GINKO]
This is some of the liquid <i>mushi</i>

00:18:48.878 --> 00:18:50.546
we saw a minute ago.

00:18:50.588 --> 00:18:53.090
If I inject this
into the glass eye,

00:18:53.132 --> 00:18:55.509
it should turn into
a functioning eyeball.

00:19:01.641 --> 00:19:04.727
Say, um... Can I
ask you something?

00:19:04.769 --> 00:19:06.354
This "river of light"
you mentioned

00:19:06.395 --> 00:19:08.981
that the two of you
say you can see...

00:19:09.023 --> 00:19:11.651
Well, what is it, exactly?

00:19:11.692 --> 00:19:16.739
[NARRATOR] Try now, if you can,
to close your second eyelid.

00:19:16.781 --> 00:19:17.740
[GINKO]
What do you mean?

00:19:17.782 --> 00:19:19.950
Are you saying that
you've forgotten?

00:19:20.993 --> 00:19:22.495
[NARRATOR]
Only then will the path

00:19:22.536 --> 00:19:25.081
to true darkness be revealed...

00:19:26.624 --> 00:19:29.293
[GINKO]
You, too, could see it once...

00:19:29.335 --> 00:19:30.753
...in the past.

00:19:40.388 --> 00:19:41.639
[NARRATOR]
From the time that man

00:19:41.681 --> 00:19:43.808
first emerged into the light,

00:19:43.849 --> 00:19:47.228
it is said that he forgot how
to close his second eyelid.

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:50.981
[NARRATOR]
However...

00:19:51.023 --> 00:19:54.026
...this development was
perhaps for the best.

00:19:56.028 --> 00:19:58.030
[NARRATOR]
For before that time,

00:19:58.072 --> 00:20:00.366
many a man had lost his sight

00:20:00.408 --> 00:20:04.120
from staring too long into the
underground river of light.

00:20:10.251 --> 00:20:12.336
[NARRATOR]
The second eyelid...

00:20:12.378 --> 00:20:14.588
True darkness...

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:16.549
Alien light...

00:20:26.517 --> 00:20:28.686
[NARRATOR] Each of these
names refers to the sea

00:20:28.728 --> 00:20:32.648
of infinite life forms,
swimming beneath our feet.

00:20:35.901 --> 00:20:38.571
[BIKI]
Suddenly, there was a big flash

00:20:38.612 --> 00:20:40.990
that lit up
everything around us.

00:20:41.031 --> 00:20:44.410
And then we were
plunged into darkness.

00:20:44.452 --> 00:20:47.621
It felt like the ground
fell out beneath me,

00:20:47.663 --> 00:20:49.582
and I thought I could
see a river of light

00:20:49.623 --> 00:20:51.959
flowing far down below...

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:55.087
[BIKI]
It was only for a second,

00:20:55.129 --> 00:20:57.965
after the <i>mushi</i> master
gave you the glass eye...

00:20:59.759 --> 00:21:02.470
[BIKI]
But it was so beautiful...

00:21:02.511 --> 00:21:05.556
I felt as though I was
being pulled into it.

00:21:05.598 --> 00:21:07.975
I wanted to stare
at it forever...

00:21:11.395 --> 00:21:12.563
[door slides]

00:21:12.605 --> 00:21:14.023
[SUI]
I'm ready.

00:21:18.402 --> 00:21:21.739
[BIKI] Sui was finally able
to come out of the shed.

00:21:21.781 --> 00:21:23.783
She's so happy now.

00:21:23.824 --> 00:21:25.201
She spends her time admiring

00:21:25.242 --> 00:21:29.538
the trees and the flowers
in the sunlight.

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:31.165
I don't think
she'll ever be tempted

00:21:31.207 --> 00:21:35.002
to look for that strange
light in the darkness again.

00:21:37.838 --> 00:21:40.132
[BIKI]
I never did ask him,

00:21:40.174 --> 00:21:43.177
but I wonder if the <i>mushi</i>
master lost his real eye

00:21:43.219 --> 00:21:44.762
the same way Sui did.

00:23:48.719 --> 00:23:51.722
[NARRATOR]
Next: "Tender Horns."
