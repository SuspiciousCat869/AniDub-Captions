there have been three people
who have used that inkstone.

I've heard all three died less
than a month after using it.

fell ill.

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:46.609

Both he and his parents

00:08:57.245 --> 00:08:59.998
were opposed to me

all this on your own,

I put everything I had into

But even so, I never made
anything I was satisfied with.

00:09:51.299 --> 00:09:55.428

I discovered that rock.

It was enchanting.

00:09:57.472 --> 00:10:00.809
I began working on it
with a passion.

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:02.602
And the inkstone
I created from it

00:10:02.644 --> 00:10:04.729
was a brilliant masterpiece.

00:10:08.149 --> 00:10:09.901
It's beautiful work.

00:10:09.943 --> 00:10:12.445

on it and test it out.

[TAGANE'S FATHER]
What's wrong?

00:10:33.967 --> 00:10:35.677
Was that smoke?

00:10:35.718 --> 00:10:38.304
Something came out
of the inkstone.

00:10:38.346 --> 00:10:40.014
Look! It's right there!

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:43.268
I see nothing.

00:10:53.987 --> 00:10:57.031
The ink's texture
is good, as well.

I can rest assured now that
you can continue my work.

00:11:08.626 --> 00:11:12.005
[TAGANE] Several days passed
after I inhaled that smoke.

00:11:12.046 --> 00:11:14.591
It didn't seem to have
had any effect on me.

00:11:14.632 --> 00:11:17.510
I was the only one that saw it.

00:11:17.552 --> 00:11:19.554
I hoped my fiancé
would reconsider

00:11:19.596 --> 00:11:21.181
once he saw the inkstone.

00:11:26.477 --> 00:11:28.229
All right, then.

00:11:28.271 --> 00:11:30.190
Would you mind
if I borrowed this?

00:11:30.231 --> 00:11:33.985
I'll need it if I'm going to try
and convince my parents.

00:11:34.027 --> 00:11:35.069

Do you mean it?

Yes.

00:11:36.321 --> 00:11:40.617
Once I have their approval on
this, I'll send you a letter.

00:11:40.658 --> 00:11:43.203
[TAGANE] I received
a letter a month later.

00:11:43.244 --> 00:11:47.081
But the letter was to
inform me that he had died.

00:11:47.123 --> 00:11:49.417
On the day
I delivered the stone,

00:11:49.459 --> 00:11:52.253
he began complaining of chills.

00:11:52.295 --> 00:11:54.839
It seems he contracted
some sort of strange disease

00:11:54.881 --> 00:11:57.550
that continuously lowered
his body temperature.

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:01.846
Believing that the
inkstone was cursed,

00:12:01.888 --> 00:12:04.641
his family decided to
sell it to an antique store.

00:12:07.227 --> 00:12:11.105
I went to the store, but it
had already been sold.

00:12:11.147 --> 00:12:13.316
The owner had no
record of the buyer,

00:12:13.358 --> 00:12:15.318
so I lost track
of its whereabouts.

00:12:17.862 --> 00:12:19.614
But a rumor later
came to the store

00:12:19.656 --> 00:12:21.449
from one of its antique dealers.

00:12:24.202 --> 00:12:27.580
[DEALER] Another person has died
because of that inkstone.

00:12:31.876 --> 00:12:35.505
[TAGANE] Not long after
that, my father died.

00:12:35.546 --> 00:12:39.509
I haven't made another
inkstone since that day.

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:41.219
I'd like to help you,

00:12:41.261 --> 00:12:44.055
but I've already told you
everything I know about it.

00:12:47.183 --> 00:12:49.727
[GINKO]
Actually, you have helped.

00:12:49.769 --> 00:12:52.021
I think I know what
it is now. Thank you.

00:12:52.063 --> 00:12:54.732
Hey! Where are you going?

00:12:54.774 --> 00:12:56.901
Sorry, but I'm in a hurry.

00:12:56.943 --> 00:12:58.486
[TAGANE]
Wait!

00:12:58.528 --> 00:12:59.821
I beg of you.

00:12:59.862 --> 00:13:01.489
Let me buy that stone.

00:13:01.531 --> 00:13:04.158
That way, I can
destroy it myself.

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:08.746
I'm sorry, but it's
not mine to sell.

00:13:08.788 --> 00:13:10.790
But if you like,
you can come with me.

00:13:29.183 --> 00:13:30.935
You're just asking for trouble.

00:13:30.977 --> 00:13:33.855
The things that you
collect are paranormal.

00:13:36.899 --> 00:13:39.027
[ADASHINO]
I know, I know, I just...

00:13:40.194 --> 00:13:40.987
[GINKO]
I see...

00:13:41.029 --> 00:13:43.239
So you've finally started
to learn your lesson.

00:13:43.281 --> 00:13:44.866
[ADASHINO]
You're back!

00:13:44.907 --> 00:13:46.326
If you're going to
give me a hard time,

00:13:46.367 --> 00:13:47.869
I hope you at least found out--

00:13:49.787 --> 00:13:52.457
Don't worry. I'll save them.

00:13:58.463 --> 00:14:01.674
[ADASHINO] So coal, a portable
stove, and what else?

00:14:01.716 --> 00:14:04.302
A pot. And do you
have a backpack?

00:14:04.344 --> 00:14:07.263
[ADASHINO]
Hm... Yeah.

00:14:07.305 --> 00:14:10.266
[GINKO] The <i>mushi</i> inside the
inkstone is called a <i>Kumohami</i>,

00:14:10.308 --> 00:14:12.560
or cloud eater.

00:14:12.602 --> 00:14:14.395
They look like
a nimbus cloud,

00:14:14.437 --> 00:14:16.356
and, just like
their name implies,

00:14:16.397 --> 00:14:18.816
they eat the moisture
and ice in the atmosphere

00:14:18.858 --> 00:14:22.028
and turn it into snow and hail.

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:25.198
It's the reason you see
hail fall from time to time

00:14:25.239 --> 00:14:27.283
when there isn't
a cloud in the sky.

00:14:27.325 --> 00:14:28.951
But they can't
move on their own.

00:14:28.993 --> 00:14:31.079
They rely on the wind
to carry them.

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.873
If enough time passes where
the sky is cloudless,

00:14:33.915 --> 00:14:36.084
they freeze and
condense themselves,

00:14:36.125 --> 00:14:38.086
and fall to the
Earth to hibernate.

00:14:38.127 --> 00:14:41.422
After centuries of
remaining in hibernation,

00:14:41.464 --> 00:14:43.674
the <i>mushi</i> turns into stone.

00:14:43.716 --> 00:14:46.386
In this case, they were
fortunate to be discovered

00:14:46.427 --> 00:14:48.221
and used as an inkstone.

00:14:48.262 --> 00:14:50.932
Each time they're given water
and have their surface rubbed,

00:14:50.973 --> 00:14:52.809
they reproduce.

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:54.644
[ADASHINO] So what
do you suggest we do?

00:14:57.188 --> 00:14:58.147
[GINKO]
Tagane.

00:14:58.189 --> 00:14:59.941
When you delivered the
stone to your fiancé,

00:14:59.982 --> 00:15:02.276
you crossed a mountain,
didn't you?

00:15:02.318 --> 00:15:03.861
That must be the
reason you survived

00:15:03.903 --> 00:15:06.030
after inhaling the smoke.

00:15:06.072 --> 00:15:07.156
We need to take these children

00:15:07.198 --> 00:15:09.283
to the closest
and highest mountains.

00:15:24.632 --> 00:15:25.758
It's worse.

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.093
Give her some hot water!

00:15:27.135 --> 00:15:28.136
[GIRL'S MOTHER]
Right!

00:15:29.178 --> 00:15:31.097
[GIRL'S MOTHER] Oh, no!
The water's gone cold!

00:15:31.139 --> 00:15:33.057
I'll run ahead and
boil some for you.

00:15:33.099 --> 00:15:34.642
[GIRL'S MOTHER]
Thank you so much!

00:15:42.525 --> 00:15:45.194
[GIRL'S MOTHER] Doctor, do we
have to climb much further?

00:15:46.737 --> 00:15:48.948
It's becoming
difficult to breathe,

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:50.950
and it's so hard
on the children.

00:15:54.829 --> 00:15:56.080
Ginko, please!

00:16:02.086 --> 00:16:03.588
[GINKO]
Just a little higher.

00:16:04.547 --> 00:16:08.092
[GIRL whimpering]

00:16:13.931 --> 00:16:15.183
[GINKO]
Listen! Everyone!

00:16:15.224 --> 00:16:16.434
Hold your breath!

00:16:58.935 --> 00:17:00.645
Sweetheart!
Are you all right?

00:17:03.064 --> 00:17:06.025
I think so.
I'm not cold now.

00:17:10.279 --> 00:17:11.822
Temperature's back to normal.

00:17:14.867 --> 00:17:15.535
It's over.

00:17:15.576 --> 00:17:17.161
Father! I don't
feel cold anymore!

00:17:17.203 --> 00:17:19.288
[BOY 1'S FATHER]
Hey! You had me worried there!

00:17:20.831 --> 00:17:23.668
But how? How did you know?

00:17:26.379 --> 00:17:28.548
It was the air pressure.

00:17:28.589 --> 00:17:30.508
These <i>mushi</i> live
in the stratosphere,

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:31.842
where the clouds are.

00:17:31.884 --> 00:17:32.885
With that being the case,

00:17:32.927 --> 00:17:34.804
it stands to reason that
their weight is similar

00:17:34.845 --> 00:17:36.138
to their habitat.

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:39.809
The closer they are to it,
the more they're drawn to it.

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:41.894
Your village sits
at a higher altitude.

00:17:41.936 --> 00:17:46.023
So the smoke you inhaled most
likely escaped little by little.

00:17:46.065 --> 00:17:47.191
And when you
crossed the mountain

00:17:47.233 --> 00:17:50.945
to deliver the inkstone,
it probably escaped completely.

00:17:52.446 --> 00:17:56.534
[ALL laughing, chattering]

00:18:04.417 --> 00:18:05.751
[TAGANE]
Thank goodness.

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:10.923
[TAGANE]
Thank goodness.

00:18:23.144 --> 00:18:24.854
[TAGANE] The problem
still lies in the fact

00:18:24.895 --> 00:18:28.441
that you collect these
dangerous things as a hobby!

00:18:28.482 --> 00:18:31.277
I'll be responsible
for destroying it.

00:18:31.319 --> 00:18:32.111
I told you.

00:18:32.153 --> 00:18:33.571
We know how to deal with it now,

00:18:33.613 --> 00:18:35.656
so it shouldn't be
a problem anymore.

00:18:35.698 --> 00:18:36.907
[TAGANE]
Oh really?

00:18:36.949 --> 00:18:40.286
I guess the same thing goes for
the rest of your collection?

00:18:40.328 --> 00:18:41.871
[ADASHINO]
That's none of your business.

00:18:43.581 --> 00:18:44.582
Hey, Ginko!

00:18:44.624 --> 00:18:46.208
Explain it to her, okay?

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:47.668
If she destroys that inkstone,

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:51.088
then she'll be killing
the <i>mushi</i> inside of it.

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:54.425
Hmm... Yeah,
he's right about that.

00:18:54.467 --> 00:18:56.344
[ADASHINO sighs]
It's not the <i>mushi</i>'s fault.

00:18:56.385 --> 00:18:58.054
They're innocent!

00:18:58.095 --> 00:18:59.972
Besides, look at it!

00:19:00.014 --> 00:19:02.933
That inkstone is far
too beautiful to destroy.

00:19:02.975 --> 00:19:04.185
And seeing as how you made it,

00:19:04.226 --> 00:19:06.479
don't you have the least
bit of attachment to it?

00:19:08.105 --> 00:19:09.857
I do, but...

00:19:09.899 --> 00:19:11.651
But you feel responsible
for unleashing

00:19:11.692 --> 00:19:14.403
the dormant <i>mushi</i> out
into our world, don't you?

00:19:15.863 --> 00:19:18.074
[GINKO]
There is another option.

00:19:18.115 --> 00:19:21.285
Why not... release the
<i>mushi</i> from the stone?

00:19:23.204 --> 00:19:23.829
Hey!

00:19:23.871 --> 00:19:26.499
That's my inkstone
you're talking about!

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:31.087
If I were you, Adashino,
I would let this one go.

00:19:31.128 --> 00:19:33.964
This whole situation
is partly your fault.

00:19:34.006 --> 00:19:34.924
Besides...

00:19:34.965 --> 00:19:37.176
It's really a
first class inkstone.

00:19:37.218 --> 00:19:38.886
It'd be a shame not to use it.

00:19:38.928 --> 00:19:40.721
[ADASHINO groans]

00:20:40.448 --> 00:20:41.824
[BALD VILLAGER]

00:20:49.081 --> 00:20:49.749

It's hail!

[OLD VILLAGER] But there's

Where's it coming from?

[rooftile shatters]

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.685
The repair costs to all
of the roofs of this village

00:21:09.727 --> 00:21:12.480
are going to be huge.

00:21:12.521 --> 00:21:14.899
Then you can bill me.
I'll pay it.

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:17.943
Even if it takes me a lifetime.

00:21:17.985 --> 00:21:19.320
What will you do?

00:21:19.361 --> 00:21:20.613
That's a lot of money.

00:21:22.364 --> 00:21:24.909
She can go back
to making inkstones.

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:26.243
With work like hers,

I'm sure she'd be able
to pay it off in no time.

Well, maybe.

If you do, then I'd like
to order one from you.

it has a <i>mushi</i> inside.

No. You're right.

a little longer than it used to.
