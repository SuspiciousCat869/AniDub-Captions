Solid white, with green eyes.

[YOKI]
And they're all missing an eye.

00:06:15.458 --> 00:06:18.169
[NUI] It's because of the
<i>mushi</i> living in the pond.

00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:21.006
They're most active at
night and at daybreak.

very much alive.

Just, not in the same
way you and I are.

And you say some have the
power to influence us?

00:06:41.276 --> 00:06:42.819
They exist on a different plane,

00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:46.114
but they're not entirely
disconnected from ours.

00:06:46.156 --> 00:06:50.160
Think of them as the essence
of life in its many forms.

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:53.914

But, listen. Can we talk
about something else?

00:07:47.509 --> 00:07:49.719
Like, maybe you could tell
me what kind of <i>mushi</i>

00:07:49.761 --> 00:07:51.388
live in that pond?

00:07:53.056 --> 00:07:56.309

Mm. Well...

00:07:56.351 --> 00:08:00.772
...you might say they're
"total darkness".

"Darkness"?

00:08:03.274 --> 00:08:04.275
[NUI]
Yes.

00:08:04.317 --> 00:08:06.695
There are two types of darkness.

00:08:06.736 --> 00:08:09.280
The first occurs when
you close your eyes,

00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:11.783
or when you're outside
on a moonless night.

00:08:11.825 --> 00:08:14.285
It's the temporary darkness.

00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:18.164
"Total darkness", on the
other hand, is endless.

00:08:18.206 --> 00:08:21.501
During the day, the dark
<i>mushi</i> sleep in the shadows.

00:08:21.543 --> 00:08:25.380
But at night, they come out
to feed on smaller <i>mushi.</i>

00:08:25.422 --> 00:08:26.673
[YOKI]
So, what was it

00:08:26.715 --> 00:08:28.925
that made your hair
and eyes change color?

00:08:28.967 --> 00:08:30.343
And the fish?

00:08:30.385 --> 00:08:32.220
[NUI]
At dawn sometimes,

00:08:32.262 --> 00:08:35.098
the surface of the
pond sparkles silver.

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.434
Most likely an effect
caused by the remains

00:08:37.475 --> 00:08:40.895
of ingested <i>mushi</i>
dissolving in the water.

00:08:40.937 --> 00:08:44.691
The change results from repeated
exposure to that light.

00:08:44.733 --> 00:08:45.734
Yeah, but then,

00:08:45.775 --> 00:08:47.569
aren't you worried you'll
lose your other eye

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:49.362
if you stay here too long?

00:08:49.404 --> 00:08:50.822
[NUI]
You've seen the fish.

00:08:50.864 --> 00:08:53.658
Did you notice a single
one missing both eyes?

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:57.037
No, this is the
extent of the change.

00:08:57.078 --> 00:08:58.663
The sun will be setting soon.

00:08:58.705 --> 00:09:00.248
We'd best get indoors.

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:03.168
But, wait a minute, do these
<i>mushi</i> have a name?

00:09:05.003 --> 00:09:06.796
[NUI] The <i>mushi</i> which
have the characteristics

00:09:06.838 --> 00:09:09.591
of darkness are
called <i>tokoyami.</i>

00:09:09.632 --> 00:09:12.510
The <i>mushi</i> which causes
the silver light, however,

00:09:12.552 --> 00:09:16.306
seem to be a separate <i>mushi</i>
that lives within the <i>tokoyami.</i>

00:09:16.347 --> 00:09:18.850
I don't know if
that <i>mushi</i> has a name.

00:09:18.892 --> 00:09:20.894
I call it <i>"ginko".</i>

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:28.777

[YOKI]
Then, how 'bout this one?

00:09:30.111 --> 00:09:32.447
Try taking a bite of it.

00:09:32.489 --> 00:09:34.532
But don't swallow it.

Still, it's a convenient

[NUI] You know, Yoki,
when you're walking alone

through the mountains
at night,

00:10:57.532 --> 00:10:59.492
you'll invariably
come upon places

00:10:59.534 --> 00:11:01.953
where the moonlight
fails to reach the road

00:11:01.995 --> 00:11:05.123
and the stars disappear behind
the branches overhead.

00:11:05.165 --> 00:11:10.044
In the sudden darkness, it's
very easy to become disoriented.

00:11:10.086 --> 00:11:12.672
But even though it's a
fairly common experience,

00:11:12.714 --> 00:11:14.299
always be aware.

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:17.385
If it ever feels like your
memories are slipping away,

00:11:17.427 --> 00:11:20.430
if you have trouble recalling
your name or your past,

it means the <i>tokoyami</i> is near.

why you live here?

Sure. I can tell you.

00:11:56.299 --> 00:11:59.010
There's a village just
beyond these mountains.

00:11:59.052 --> 00:12:01.262
It's the place
where I was born.

00:12:01.304 --> 00:12:05.350
It's small and isolated,
but beautiful all the same.

00:12:05.391 --> 00:12:09.479
Unfortunately, because of
my tendency to attract <i>mushi,</i>

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:12.565
I'm unable to stay for
too long in one place.

00:12:12.607 --> 00:12:14.692
So I became a <i>mushi</i> master,

00:12:14.734 --> 00:12:19.072
traveling around from village
to village, exterminating <i>mushi.</i>

00:12:19.113 --> 00:12:21.532
Still, I returned home
as often as I could

00:12:21.574 --> 00:12:23.451
to visit with
friends and family.

00:12:23.493 --> 00:12:27.288
And most of all, my husband
and son, who I loved...

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:29.332
...more than anything.

00:12:29.374 --> 00:12:30.541
Until...

00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:35.213

news that a group of villagers,

my husband, son, father,
and friends among them,

00:12:38.633 --> 00:12:42.011
had ventured into the mountains
and never came back.

I searched for weeks,
but there was no sign of them.

When I came to
this place, though,

00:12:47.433 --> 00:12:50.645
and realized that there were
<i>tokoyami</i> living in the pond,

00:12:50.687 --> 00:12:53.398
well, I'd learned from
other <i>mushi</i> masters

00:12:53.439 --> 00:12:55.149
the effects of
the <i>tokoyami...</i>

00:12:55.191 --> 00:12:58.486
as well as the techniques
for avoiding them.

00:12:58.528 --> 00:13:00.655
And so it is.

00:13:00.697 --> 00:13:03.116
I continue to live here in
the hopes that my friends

00:13:03.157 --> 00:13:06.577
and loved ones... are still
out there somewhere.

00:13:06.619 --> 00:13:08.788
Wandering around.

00:13:11.332 --> 00:13:13.626
So how long have
you been out here?

00:13:13.668 --> 00:13:16.629
I'm not sure. Six years perhaps?

00:13:16.671 --> 00:13:18.715
Six years, by yourself...

00:13:20.133 --> 00:13:21.384
[YOKI]
I don't really know if your

00:13:21.426 --> 00:13:24.929
friends and family are still
out there somewhere, but,

00:13:24.971 --> 00:13:26.347
If they are,

00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:29.267
well, then I-I want to
try to help you find them!

00:13:29.309 --> 00:13:30.268
I do!

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:31.394
I could stay and--

00:13:31.436 --> 00:13:32.687
You can't!

00:13:34.188 --> 00:13:35.106
Why not?

00:13:35.148 --> 00:13:36.983
Why won't you let me?

00:13:39.027 --> 00:13:40.153
Because...

00:13:40.194 --> 00:13:42.030
I have to do this alone.

00:13:43.364 --> 00:13:45.408
It's my burden.

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:49.454
Don't let it consume
your life as well.

00:13:49.495 --> 00:13:51.372
One more word about this,

00:13:51.414 --> 00:13:53.833
and I'll have you
leave right now.

00:14:21.694 --> 00:14:23.237
I know she's hiding something.

00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:26.866
There's a real reason why she
doesn't want me to stay here.

00:14:26.908 --> 00:14:28.242
Come on, <i>tokoyami!</i>

00:14:28.284 --> 00:14:29.702
<i>ginko,</i> come out!

00:14:41.798 --> 00:14:46.803
[YOKI gasping]

00:14:48.137 --> 00:14:49.347
[YOKI gasps]

00:14:53.851 --> 00:14:55.728
[YOKI]
What's happening to that fish?

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:57.730
Its good eye is...

00:15:09.534 --> 00:15:10.827
[YOKI]
It disappeared...

00:15:10.868 --> 00:15:12.203
[NUI]
Yoki!

00:15:12.245 --> 00:15:13.871
What are you doing out here?

00:15:13.913 --> 00:15:16.290
I told you it's not good to
be exposed to that light--!

00:15:16.332 --> 00:15:16.999
[YOKI]
Listen...

00:15:17.041 --> 00:15:19.293
The reason the fish
still have one eye...

00:15:19.335 --> 00:15:22.588
...is because they disappear
when both eyes are gone.

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:25.800
Did... Did you know that?

00:15:25.842 --> 00:15:27.760
[NUI]
They haven't disappeared.

00:15:27.802 --> 00:15:29.429
The light emitted by the <i>ginko</i>

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:32.849
turns living things
into <i>tokoyami.</i>

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:34.058
It's the same thing!

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:37.019
If you knew, then why didn't
you do something about it?!

00:15:37.061 --> 00:15:38.438
You're a <i>mushi</i> master!

00:15:38.479 --> 00:15:41.607
Why would you even let
something that terrible exist?!

00:15:42.942 --> 00:15:46.988
You must not let your vision
be clouded by fear and anger.

00:15:47.029 --> 00:15:49.157
There are times when
we must simply accept

00:15:49.198 --> 00:15:52.577
that all things serve
a larger purpose.

00:15:52.618 --> 00:15:55.371
The cycle of life extends
beyond the world we can see,

00:15:55.413 --> 00:15:58.708
and connects us all
in unexpected ways.

00:15:58.749 --> 00:16:03.129
Therefore, whenever possible,
a wise <i>mushi</i> master chooses

00:16:03.171 --> 00:16:06.215
understanding
over extermination.

00:16:06.257 --> 00:16:07.550
As for me,

00:16:07.592 --> 00:16:11.262
I've spent my time here studying
the <i>ginko</i> in some detail.

00:16:11.304 --> 00:16:13.764
Unfortunately, by the
time I discovered

00:16:13.806 --> 00:16:15.725
what ultimately
became of the fish,

00:16:15.766 --> 00:16:18.978
I had already been exposed to
too much of the <i>ginko's</i> light.

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:21.772
I began gathering one-eyed
fish from the pond

00:16:21.814 --> 00:16:23.691
and experimented
with various ways

00:16:23.733 --> 00:16:25.985
to protect them
from further exposure.

00:16:26.027 --> 00:16:27.403
However...

00:16:27.445 --> 00:16:30.031
Once the fish started
to turn white,

00:16:30.072 --> 00:16:33.284
while I was able to delay the
change to a certain extent,

00:16:33.326 --> 00:16:37.788
eventually, all of them lost
both eyes and became <i>tokoyami.</i>

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:39.248
All of them?

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:40.791
Then, you mean...?

00:16:40.833 --> 00:16:44.253
For a time, I refused to accept
the idea that my husband and son

00:16:44.295 --> 00:16:46.589
had been transformed
into <i>tokoyami.</i>

00:16:46.631 --> 00:16:47.924
I continued my search,

00:16:47.965 --> 00:16:51.802
clinging to the hope that they
had somehow avoided exposure.

00:16:51.844 --> 00:16:56.682
Then, one day, I suddenly
came to the realization.

00:16:56.724 --> 00:17:00.353
My whole world, everything I
had ever cared about,

00:17:00.394 --> 00:17:02.688
it was all right here.

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:04.482
There's nothing more for me.

00:17:04.524 --> 00:17:07.568
But you, Yoki, if you
understand what I'm saying,

00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:09.320
you'll leave this
place while you can.

00:17:09.362 --> 00:17:11.614
No! I'm not just going to
let you give up like this!

00:17:11.656 --> 00:17:14.367
--Please! Come with me!
--[NUI] Fool! Don't be absurd!

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:18.829
[NUI]
I'm beyond help now.

00:17:18.871 --> 00:17:22.750
It's a fact I thought I'd come
to terms with long ago, but...

00:17:22.792 --> 00:17:26.254
...your being here, it only
makes things difficult.

00:17:30.466 --> 00:17:32.885
[NUI]
Please. Just go.

00:17:32.927 --> 00:17:34.136
And don't worry,

00:17:34.178 --> 00:17:36.722
I think life on the
road will suit you well.

00:17:36.764 --> 00:17:38.808
Believe me, you're better off

00:17:38.849 --> 00:17:40.726
not having a place
you call home.

00:17:40.768 --> 00:17:42.937
I won't!

00:17:42.979 --> 00:17:44.438
This is my home!

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.732
I've lived here longer
than anywhere else!

00:17:46.774 --> 00:17:47.692
[NUI]
Yoki.

00:17:47.733 --> 00:17:50.403
This place is where
the <i>tokoyami</i> lives.

00:17:50.444 --> 00:17:52.321
It's where I live.

00:17:52.363 --> 00:17:54.365
It's not a place for you.

00:18:23.227 --> 00:18:25.187
The time...

00:18:25.229 --> 00:18:27.064
...has finally come.

00:18:39.076 --> 00:18:40.536

Don't go!

00:18:56.052 --> 00:18:57.470

Go back!

00:19:15.112 --> 00:19:16.405
But you're--

00:19:16.447 --> 00:19:18.532
[NUI]
It's too late for me now.

00:19:20.743 --> 00:19:22.995
The <i>ginko</i> will awaken soon.

00:19:23.037 --> 00:19:25.873
Get as far away as you can.

00:19:25.915 --> 00:19:28.793
Come now... hurry!

00:19:28.834 --> 00:19:31.212
[YOKI]
It's strange. Your hand.

00:19:31.253 --> 00:19:34.090
There's no warmth, but...
but it's not cold either.

00:19:34.131 --> 00:19:35.591
[NUI]
I know.

00:19:35.633 --> 00:19:38.135
But your hand is still warm.

00:19:38.177 --> 00:19:40.012
And not just your hand.

00:19:40.054 --> 00:19:43.599
I no longer have eyes,
but when you look at me,

00:19:43.641 --> 00:19:46.394
even now, I can feel it.

00:19:46.435 --> 00:19:48.604
Warm, like sunshine.

00:19:48.646 --> 00:19:50.981
After so many years
alone on that cold,

00:19:51.023 --> 00:19:54.527

know that feeling again.

Now, listen Yoki.

00:19:56.529 --> 00:19:59.657
From here on,
keep one eye closed.

00:19:59.699 --> 00:20:02.201
You will have to sacrifice
one eye to the <i>ginko,</i>

in order to escape the <i>tokoyami.</i>

00:20:04.704 --> 00:20:06.372
But no matter what happens,

00:20:06.414 --> 00:20:08.624
keep your other
eye closed tightly.

You'll need it, if you're
to see the sunlight again.

So, that's the <i>ginko.</i>

An eye-less fish that swims
in the endless darkness.

00:20:42.074 --> 00:20:43.367

You must not let your vision

what was it I was
supposed to do?
