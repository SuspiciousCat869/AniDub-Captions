A <i>mushi</i> master?

00:01:51.695 --> 00:01:54.698
Yes. My name is Ginko.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.619
I hear you have
premonitions in your dreams.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.622
Your reputation is
well-known in these parts.

00:02:01.663 --> 00:02:02.539
But I'm here because

00:02:02.581 --> 00:02:05.125
there might be something
wrong with these dreams.

00:02:06.835 --> 00:02:08.587
Just what do you mean by that?

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:12.007
[GINKO] It's likely that the
<i>mushi</i> are involved in this.

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:14.843
Some of them live
within dreams...

00:02:14.885 --> 00:02:17.929
...and can show you
premonitions of the future.

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:20.474
They will continue to
breed and multiply.

00:02:20.515 --> 00:02:23.226
This medicine should be able
to keep them under control.

00:02:24.186 --> 00:02:25.896
[GINKO] How often do
these prophetic dreams

00:02:25.937 --> 00:02:27.189
turn out to be true?

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.609
I'd say about...
one or two in ten.

00:02:30.651 --> 00:02:33.820
[GINKO] In time, that number
will increase to four or five.

00:02:33.862 --> 00:02:36.615
When it does, you should
begin taking the medicine.

00:02:36.657 --> 00:02:40.535
If you take it too soon,
it could be toxic.

00:02:40.577 --> 00:02:42.204
But know that if you
don't take it at all,

00:02:42.245 --> 00:02:44.498
you'll remain in
your dreams forever.

00:02:45.582 --> 00:02:48.001
[GINKO] What's important is
the balance between the two.

00:02:48.043 --> 00:02:50.337
So please, be sure to take it.

00:02:52.714 --> 00:02:55.717
[GINKO] I'll stop by again
before the medicine runs out.

00:02:57.511 --> 00:02:59.596
[GINKO]
So, until then...

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:02.432
[GINKO]
...pleasant dreams.

00:03:15.237 --> 00:03:16.780
[NARRATOR]
You should never converse with

00:03:16.822 --> 00:03:19.449
someone talking
in their sleep.

00:03:19.491 --> 00:03:22.828

00:03:37.801 --> 00:03:40.053
[GINKO]
So what happened?

00:03:40.095 --> 00:03:41.388
What's going on?

00:04:06.621 --> 00:04:09.291

I've been waiting.

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.339
There's something that I've
been wanting to ask you.

00:04:17.966 --> 00:04:19.718
So are you alone here?

00:04:20.886 --> 00:04:22.721
[GINKO]
I saw the village...

00:04:22.763 --> 00:04:23.764
Don't tell me that the--

Yes.

That's right.

00:04:28.018 --> 00:04:30.145
I'll tell you what
happened here...

Huh?

It's a water vein!

00:05:06.515 --> 00:05:09.559

00:05:19.486 --> 00:05:22.239
[MAN 2 chuckles] Another one
of Jin's dreams came true!

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.324

this to say thank you.

I know what you mean.

00:05:40.423 --> 00:05:42.592
But since I can't begin to
provide a meal like that

00:05:42.634 --> 00:05:44.261
from what I'm paid
to sharpen swords.

The number of dreams you
have that are coming true...

You believed what he said?

That the <i>mushi</i> are
causing my dreams?

I don't know, really...

00:06:08.285 --> 00:06:09.578
Maybe.

But, Jin...

00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:14.833
What if what everything
he was telling us is true?

00:06:14.875 --> 00:06:16.376
All right, Dear.

00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:19.337
I'll take the medicine.

00:06:20.755 --> 00:06:22.465
Good.

premonitions comes true,

I can't help but to feel that

00:07:01.796 --> 00:07:04.299
I somehow caused
these things happen.

Don't worry about it so much.

00:07:34.579 --> 00:07:36.706
I'm sure the only reason
you have those dreams

00:07:36.748 --> 00:07:39.584
is so you can help other people.

00:07:39.626 --> 00:07:41.252

And it's all because of you.

that's what I told my wife.

But I still felt an
apprehension about the dreams.

00:07:59.521 --> 00:08:01.106
These visions...

00:08:01.147 --> 00:08:04.067
So I secretly began to take
the medicine on my own.

00:08:05.777 --> 00:08:07.112

But then...

00:08:57.871 --> 00:09:01.207
[JIN] It's all because
I took this damn medicine!

That's why I couldn't see
what would happen to Mayu!

Soon after...

The number of premonitions
I had increased.

And they were becoming
more vivid, more accurate...

It was the same illness

00:10:25.166 --> 00:10:28.002
I had seen in my dream
the night before.

00:10:28.044 --> 00:10:30.755
A green mold that would
appear at the fingertips

00:10:30.797 --> 00:10:33.216
and spread over the entire body,

00:10:33.258 --> 00:10:36.803
causing it to crumble
apart like dirt.

After that...

...I was the only
one left in the village.

00:10:45.687 --> 00:10:48.189
[JIN] You said your
name was Ginko, right?

00:10:49.232 --> 00:10:51.734
Well, after that dream
became real, Ginko...

00:10:51.776 --> 00:10:53.903
That's when it came to me...

00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:58.950
[JIN] When you stopped by to
visit me that first time...

00:10:58.992 --> 00:11:01.119
You had deceived me.

00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:09.377
What lurks inside my mind are

00:11:09.419 --> 00:11:11.880
not the <i>mushi</i> that give
one prophetic dreams...

00:11:11.921 --> 00:11:13.882
They are the <i>mushi</i> that
bring one's dreams

00:11:13.923 --> 00:11:16.593
out of the mind
to infect reality.

00:11:17.552 --> 00:11:19.888
[JIN]
That green mold disease...

00:11:19.929 --> 00:11:21.848
It first began to spread
through the people

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:23.558
that were closest to me.

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:26.853
It took my wife,
then my neighbors,

00:11:26.895 --> 00:11:31.065
and after that, it spread
to the houses across the way.

00:11:31.983 --> 00:11:35.778

There, before my very eyes,

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:38.323
the exact same scene that
had been in my dreams

00:11:38.364 --> 00:11:40.366
became a reality.

00:11:40.408 --> 00:11:42.202
All of my premonitions,

00:11:42.243 --> 00:11:44.621
everything I had
seen in my mind,

00:11:44.662 --> 00:11:47.957
were all events that were
created through my dreams.

00:11:50.043 --> 00:11:51.794
That's the truth.

00:11:51.836 --> 00:11:53.713
And you knew it!

00:11:53.755 --> 00:11:56.132
So why did you lie to me?!

00:12:00.762 --> 00:12:05.558
Because this is a <i>mushi</i> that you
can never be completely rid of.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.560
Once the parasite
gets inside of you,

00:12:07.602 --> 00:12:10.313
it stays with you for
the rest of your life.

00:12:10.355 --> 00:12:13.191
Your only option is
to co-exist with it.

00:12:14.943 --> 00:12:17.278
Tell me... If you had
known the truth,

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.155
do you honestly believe
you could have handled

00:12:19.197 --> 00:12:22.158
the burden of knowing
what your dreams can do?

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.117
No...

00:12:23.159 --> 00:12:25.370
But then none of this
would have happened!

00:12:25.411 --> 00:12:28.373
Why didn't you just let me die?!

00:12:28.414 --> 00:12:30.333
They're all dead because of me!

00:12:30.375 --> 00:12:31.960
Dead!

00:12:32.001 --> 00:12:37.423
[chokes, sobs]

00:12:38.716 --> 00:12:40.760
[GINKO]
I'm sorry...

00:12:40.802 --> 00:12:44.013
Now that it's come to this,
I'll do everything I can

00:12:44.055 --> 00:12:47.642
to find a way to rid
you of the <i>mushi.</i>

00:12:47.684 --> 00:12:51.229
Please... Go on living.

00:12:51.271 --> 00:12:55.233
The <i>yumeno no awai,</i> meaning
"The Field and Space of Dream,"

00:12:55.275 --> 00:12:56.901
are a type of <i>mushi</i>
that normally

00:12:56.943 --> 00:12:59.279
reside in the dreams
of their host.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:02.156
But on occasion, they
come out of these dreams,

00:13:02.198 --> 00:13:06.536
becoming the medium that brings
what the host sees into reality.

00:13:06.577 --> 00:13:07.537
That's why...

00:13:07.578 --> 00:13:10.999
not all of your dreams
were prophetic in nature.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:14.711
As they multiply, their
chances of escape increase.

00:13:16.879 --> 00:13:19.632
[GINKO] And the scale and range
of what they can make real

00:13:19.674 --> 00:13:21.884
becomes greater as well.

00:13:21.926 --> 00:13:24.512
But still, the <i>mushi</i> are
weak while in this state,

00:13:24.554 --> 00:13:28.099
and will disappear if
exposed to sunlight.

00:13:28.141 --> 00:13:31.311
It's not known why they
come out into our world.

00:13:31.352 --> 00:13:34.897
But somewhere there is a pathway
connecting dreams with reality,

00:13:34.939 --> 00:13:37.567
on which only the
<i>mushi</i> can travel.

00:13:37.608 --> 00:13:40.194
It is said that this
is where they sleep

00:13:40.236 --> 00:13:42.030
while the host is awake.

00:13:44.699 --> 00:13:46.951
[GINKO]
If I can find this pathway,

00:13:46.993 --> 00:13:49.287
I might be able
to do something.

00:13:51.914 --> 00:13:53.583
[sighs]

00:13:53.624 --> 00:13:55.376
But I've never
heard of a case like this

00:13:55.418 --> 00:13:58.004
on such a grand scale before.

00:13:58.046 --> 00:14:01.049
The medicine alone won't
be able to stop it.

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:03.551
Maybe if I increase
the dosage...

00:14:03.593 --> 00:14:04.427
Hm?

00:14:04.469 --> 00:14:05.595
[thud]

00:14:07.972 --> 00:14:08.890
[gasps]

00:14:08.931 --> 00:14:09.557
Jin!

00:14:09.599 --> 00:14:16.606
[JIN groaning]

00:14:16.647 --> 00:14:19.317
The medicine! You took it all?!

00:14:19.359 --> 00:14:20.651
Hang on! I'll get the antidote!

00:14:20.693 --> 00:14:22.487
Don't bother!

00:14:22.528 --> 00:14:24.030
[GINKO gasps]

00:14:24.072 --> 00:14:27.075
[JIN]
Leave me be...

00:14:27.116 --> 00:14:30.161
I can't go on...

00:14:30.203 --> 00:14:31.704
Just let me die...

00:14:36.918 --> 00:14:38.961
[shallow breathing]

00:14:50.848 --> 00:14:52.642
[GINKO]
His eyes are moving.

00:14:52.683 --> 00:14:54.394
He's beginning to dream...

00:14:56.104 --> 00:14:57.730
Forgive me...

00:14:57.772 --> 00:14:59.148
[GINKO]
Sleep talking?

00:15:01.609 --> 00:15:03.403
[GINKO]
You are not to blame.

00:15:05.571 --> 00:15:07.740
And neither are the <i>mushi...</i>

00:15:07.782 --> 00:15:12.578
The both of you were just
carrying on with your lives.

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:14.789
This wasn't anyone's fault.

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:18.876
[GINKO]
Don't die.

00:15:18.918 --> 00:15:20.878
You've done nothing wrong.

00:15:25.967 --> 00:15:28.177
Are those... wild geese?

00:15:28.219 --> 00:15:29.220
[GINKO gasps]

00:15:31.973 --> 00:15:33.975
He is sleep talking.

00:15:34.016 --> 00:15:36.269
This is useless.

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:37.520
Where are you, anyway?

00:15:37.562 --> 00:15:41.065
Just hurry up and
come back to reality.

00:15:41.107 --> 00:15:44.444
A field... of reeds...

00:15:44.485 --> 00:15:45.987
[GINKO gasps]

00:15:46.028 --> 00:15:47.363
He answered me!

00:15:47.405 --> 00:15:49.157
[ringing]

00:15:49.198 --> 00:15:51.075
[GINKO groans]

00:15:51.117 --> 00:15:52.201
That ringing...!

00:15:52.243 --> 00:15:53.411
What is it?!

00:15:57.081 --> 00:16:01.919
[cawing]

00:16:01.961 --> 00:16:03.254
[GINKO]
What is this?

00:16:05.465 --> 00:16:08.926
[GINKO] Our conversation just
connected his dream to reality!

00:16:08.968 --> 00:16:10.595
I see now.

00:16:10.636 --> 00:16:12.388
He thought these were geese.

00:16:14.974 --> 00:16:18.060
[GINKO] It's a giant
flock of <i>yumeno no awai!</i>

00:16:43.503 --> 00:16:44.754
[footsteps]

00:16:44.795 --> 00:16:46.130
Daddy!

00:16:46.172 --> 00:16:47.673
Welcome home!

00:16:49.133 --> 00:16:50.760
Mayu!

00:16:50.801 --> 00:16:52.136
[KINU]
We missed you!

00:16:52.178 --> 00:16:53.221
[JIN gasps]

00:16:53.262 --> 00:16:54.722
Kinu!

00:16:57.808 --> 00:17:02.104
[JIN cries]

00:17:02.146 --> 00:17:04.273
[JIN]
I'm sorry...

00:17:04.315 --> 00:17:05.149
[MAYU]
Huh?

00:17:05.191 --> 00:17:07.151
[JIN]
i'm so sorry...

00:17:07.193 --> 00:17:09.529
I killed you both...

00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:10.947
I failed...

00:17:10.988 --> 00:17:16.118
I know you must hate me...
for what I've done to you.

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.913
It's all right...

00:17:18.955 --> 00:17:20.873
None of this is
your fault, Dear.

00:17:22.625 --> 00:17:25.086
[KINU]
You've done nothing wrong...

00:17:25.127 --> 00:17:26.170
[JIN gasps]

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:33.719
Is there... someone here?

00:17:35.972 --> 00:17:38.558
[JIN gasps]

00:17:40.059 --> 00:17:41.143
[JIN]
It's me!

00:17:44.939 --> 00:17:46.691
[JIN]
What's that in the panel?

00:17:48.025 --> 00:17:48.985
[JIN]
Fire...?

00:17:49.026 --> 00:17:50.570
It's hot...

00:17:50.611 --> 00:17:51.696
Someone...

00:17:53.489 --> 00:17:56.701
[JIN] Is that my dream being
reflected onto the screen?

00:18:01.163 --> 00:18:02.540
[JIN]
The fire...

00:18:02.582 --> 00:18:05.585
It moved from the
dream onto my pillow!

00:18:05.626 --> 00:18:06.961
[GINKO]
Now I get it!

00:18:08.546 --> 00:18:09.839
It's there, too!

00:18:14.552 --> 00:18:15.553
Wake up!

00:18:16.971 --> 00:18:17.972
[JIN groans]

00:18:18.014 --> 00:18:19.599
[GINKO]
I'll get water!

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.392
[JIN groans]

00:18:21.434 --> 00:18:22.435
[gasps]

00:18:25.771 --> 00:18:28.649
[JIN] The dream came into
reality through the pillow!

00:18:30.985 --> 00:18:32.653
[GINKO]
But somewhere there is a pathway

00:18:32.695 --> 00:18:34.614
connecting dreams with reality,

00:18:34.655 --> 00:18:36.907
on which only the
<i>mushi</i> can travel.

00:18:36.949 --> 00:18:39.285
It is said that this
is where they sleep

00:18:39.327 --> 00:18:40.995
while the host is awake...

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:45.583
[JIN groans]

00:18:46.792 --> 00:18:49.795
That's it... Now I know
where you've been hiding.

00:18:52.256 --> 00:18:53.257
[GINKO gasps]

00:18:55.134 --> 00:18:57.386
Damned <i>mushi!</i>

00:18:57.428 --> 00:18:59.347
Now you're going to pay!

00:18:59.388 --> 00:19:00.681
No! Stop it!

00:19:11.275 --> 00:19:14.862
[panting]

00:19:14.904 --> 00:19:15.946
[chuckles]

00:19:18.324 --> 00:19:19.325
[chokes]

00:19:22.161 --> 00:19:27.166
[groans]

00:19:28.793 --> 00:19:30.044
[JIN]
But...

00:19:30.086 --> 00:19:31.337
But why?

00:19:32.838 --> 00:19:36.258
[JIN]
Why did it cut me, too?

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:37.301
[sighs]

00:19:55.403 --> 00:19:58.531
His body seems to be responding
well to the treatment.

00:19:58.572 --> 00:20:01.367
With some rest, he's
going to be just fine.

00:20:11.836 --> 00:20:12.920
[GINKO sighs]

00:20:22.096 --> 00:20:25.141
[JIN] Did you know it
would turn out like this?

00:20:25.182 --> 00:20:26.267
Look at me.

00:20:26.308 --> 00:20:28.394
All I did was cut the pillow...

00:20:32.398 --> 00:20:33.649
The word "pillow"...

00:20:33.691 --> 00:20:36.861
Do you know where the origin
of that word comes from?

00:20:36.902 --> 00:20:40.489
It means the
"storeroom of the soul."

00:20:40.531 --> 00:20:44.368
For one third of your life,
your pillow cradles your head.

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:46.328
Perhaps that is how
the idea came about

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:49.707
that the pillow is
where the soul rests.

00:20:49.749 --> 00:20:52.835
The pillow was the nest
of the <i>yumeno no awai,</i>

00:20:52.877 --> 00:20:56.505
and served as the pathway
connecting dreams and reality.

00:20:57.757 --> 00:20:59.884
[GINKO]
I thought that if you cut it,

00:20:59.925 --> 00:21:03.095
the thing that would
be lost would be you.

00:21:06.849 --> 00:21:09.727
[NARRATOR] The "storeroom
of the soul" is a place that

00:21:09.769 --> 00:21:12.605
lies between dreams and reality.

00:21:12.646 --> 00:21:18.277
If one does not walk this path,
one can never see Utopia...

00:21:25.284 --> 00:21:28.120
[GINKO] Thereafter, they say
that Jin began working

00:21:28.162 --> 00:21:30.706
as a blade sharpener again.

00:21:30.748 --> 00:21:32.666
He was skilled at what he did,

00:21:32.708 --> 00:21:34.877
and his reputation
was well-known.

00:21:34.919 --> 00:21:39.799
But for some reason,
he slowly lost his soul.

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:42.510
Sometimes he would
wander out into the road,

00:21:42.551 --> 00:21:44.303
waving his sword around.

00:21:48.307 --> 00:21:51.811
[GINKO]
In the end, he stabbed himself.

00:21:53.813 --> 00:21:56.857
[GINKO] People said that the
man was afraid of sleeping...

00:21:56.899 --> 00:21:58.484
That when he slept,

00:21:58.526 --> 00:22:01.737
he felt his soul would
slip away into the unknown.

00:22:06.408 --> 00:22:09.912
[GINKO] They also say that
after the man cut his pillow,

00:22:09.954 --> 00:22:13.123
he never once had another dream.

00:23:48.469 --> 00:23:51.388
