00:01:48.275 --> 00:01:51.403
[GINKO] One day, while I was
resting in a bamboo forest,

00:01:51.445 --> 00:01:53.572
a strange man approached me.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.410
[KISUKE] Excuse me, are you
heading down the mountain?

00:01:58.452 --> 00:02:00.787
Yeah. That's right.

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:01.830
[KISUKE]
I see.

00:02:01.872 --> 00:02:03.999
Planning on leaving the forest?

00:02:04.041 --> 00:02:06.793
[GINKO]
Yes. I'm headed west.

00:02:06.835 --> 00:02:08.962
I was hoping you'd say that.

00:02:09.004 --> 00:02:12.758
Mind if I join you?
I'm a little turned around.

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:14.593
[GINKO]
You're lost?

00:02:14.635 --> 00:02:16.595
[KISUKE] Yes. No matter
which way I turn,

00:02:16.637 --> 00:02:19.139
I can't seem to find
my way out of here.

00:02:19.181 --> 00:02:21.350
[GINKO] You must have a
lousy sense of direction.

00:02:21.391 --> 00:02:23.310
[KISUKE]
It's been hard for me.

00:02:23.352 --> 00:02:26.521
No one has passed through
here in over three years.

00:02:28.106 --> 00:02:29.900
You're kidding.

00:02:29.941 --> 00:02:31.151
[KISUKE]
No, really.

00:02:31.193 --> 00:02:33.195
And I know this is
going to sound strange,

00:02:33.236 --> 00:02:36.031
but I've been right
here the whole time.

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:48.669
[KISUKE] I'm originally
from the village

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.463
at the foot of the mountain.

00:02:51.505 --> 00:02:52.422
[GINKO]
I see.

00:02:52.464 --> 00:02:54.758
So, you're a local?

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.219
It's not like you can't
see the sun in here.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.596
How could you get lost?

00:02:59.638 --> 00:03:00.847
Well, to tell you the truth,

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:04.351
I don't really
understand how myself.

00:03:04.393 --> 00:03:07.896
[GINKO] I must admit; this is
a huge bamboo forest.

00:03:12.067 --> 00:03:13.068

Damnit. The same place!

00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:29.793
What's going on?

00:03:29.835 --> 00:03:32.546
I know it's not broken.

00:03:32.587 --> 00:03:35.966
We started out heading west,
and then, before we knew it,

00:03:36.007 --> 00:03:38.093
we were headed in
another direction.

00:03:38.135 --> 00:03:39.636
We must have gone
further and further

00:03:39.678 --> 00:03:42.431
off course and ended
up going in a circle.

00:03:44.516 --> 00:03:45.809
As always,

00:03:45.851 --> 00:03:47.561
that's what happens.

00:03:47.602 --> 00:03:49.730
You can't get out.

00:03:49.771 --> 00:03:51.773
What's up with this place?

00:03:51.815 --> 00:03:54.234
[KISUKE] Looks like you've
been caught up here, too.

00:03:54.276 --> 00:03:55.819
Tough luck.

00:03:55.861 --> 00:03:59.114
Well, you're more than
welcome to live here with us.

00:03:59.156 --> 00:04:00.949
Hey, that's not funny.

00:04:00.991 --> 00:04:02.993
Come on--

00:04:03.034 --> 00:04:04.786
Wait. Did you say "us"?

00:04:04.828 --> 00:04:05.829
[KISUKE]
Yes.

00:04:05.871 --> 00:04:08.707
A mother used to live
here with her daughter.

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:09.958
Ah!

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:14.171
[SETSU]
Kisuke!

00:04:14.212 --> 00:04:16.465
Sadly, the mother passed
away a few years ago,

00:04:16.506 --> 00:04:18.592
but her daughter
is now my wife.

00:04:18.633 --> 00:04:21.094
We've known each other
since we were little kids.

00:04:21.136 --> 00:04:24.222
So, at least some
good came from this.

00:04:24.264 --> 00:04:25.557
[GINKO]
Huh...

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:26.850
This is Ginko.

00:04:26.892 --> 00:04:29.186
He was just passing through.

00:04:29.227 --> 00:04:30.645
My wife, Setsu.

00:04:32.647 --> 00:04:34.399
[KISUKE]
Oh, and Ginko.

00:04:34.441 --> 00:04:36.651
Sorry if I was any trouble.

00:04:36.693 --> 00:04:38.779
I'm heading back home now.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.323
Would you care to stay a while?

00:04:41.364 --> 00:04:45.327
No. I'm going to keep on
looking for a way out.

00:04:45.368 --> 00:04:46.828
[KISUKE]
All right then.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.206
Be careful. See you later.

00:04:52.584 --> 00:04:54.211
[GINKO]
"Be careful"?

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:57.964
[GINKO]
What did he mean by that?

00:05:05.013 --> 00:05:06.014
[gasps]

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:09.518
[GINKO]
I made it...

00:05:12.813 --> 00:05:14.314
Glad that's over.

00:05:14.356 --> 00:05:15.899
[OLD WOMAN 1]
Do you think he's all right?

00:05:15.941 --> 00:05:17.317
[OLD WOMAN 2]
I can't tell. Maybe he's...

00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:18.401
Need something?

00:05:18.443 --> 00:05:20.487
Well, we were just curious.

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:22.989
You came out of the
bamboo forest, didn't you?

00:05:23.031 --> 00:05:23.907
[GINKO]
Yeah?

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:27.160
Tell me, did you see a man
while you were in there?

00:05:27.202 --> 00:05:28.036
Yeah.

00:05:28.078 --> 00:05:31.289
I think he was trying
to play a joke on me.

00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:33.333
Who is he, anyway?

00:05:34.835 --> 00:05:37.838
That man's being held
hostage by a monster.

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:38.880
You're lucky.

00:05:38.922 --> 00:05:40.966
You could've been caught, too.

00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:41.967
Monster?

00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:42.759
[OLD WOMAN 2]
Yes.

00:05:42.801 --> 00:05:45.220
There's a white bamboo that
grows in that forest, and it--

00:05:45.262 --> 00:05:47.931
[OLD WOMAN 1] Quiet! Don't tell
outsiders stories like that!

00:05:47.973 --> 00:05:48.807
Think of all the rumors

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:50.976
you're going to start
about our village.

Ginko!

Weren't you able to
find a way out of here?

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.115
[GINKO]
I did.

00:06:05.156 --> 00:06:08.368
But there was something I
wanted to see, so I came back.

00:06:10.036 --> 00:06:11.913
[GINKO] I've heard that
there's a white bamboo

00:06:11.955 --> 00:06:14.541
growing somewhere
in this forest.

00:06:14.583 --> 00:06:18.086
Also, I heard something
strange about you...

00:06:18.128 --> 00:06:19.713
...and your wife.

00:06:20.922 --> 00:06:22.799
Tell me something,

00:06:22.841 --> 00:06:25.093
Once you've seen it,

00:06:25.135 --> 00:06:26.553
What do you plan to do?

00:06:26.595 --> 00:06:28.680
[GINKO] If it falls under
my field of expertise,

00:06:28.722 --> 00:06:31.141
I'd like to hear your
story in detail.

00:06:31.182 --> 00:06:33.059
This is a rare phenomenon.

00:06:33.101 --> 00:06:34.060
Who knows?

00:06:34.102 --> 00:06:35.061
With enough information,

00:06:35.103 --> 00:06:38.732
I might be able to find a
way to get you out of here.

00:06:38.773 --> 00:06:40.984
It's too late to
tell me to walk away.

00:06:41.026 --> 00:06:44.654
I'm going to do this,
with or without your help.

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:50.619
Follow me.

00:06:59.878 --> 00:07:01.588
Here's the first one.

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:03.256
There are four others.

00:07:03.673 --> 00:07:06.968
Huh. It's a <i>"magaridake".</i>

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:07.761
What?

00:07:07.802 --> 00:07:10.931
This forest, tell me about it.

00:07:10.972 --> 00:07:13.433
This place must have a history.

00:07:13.475 --> 00:07:15.936
What happened here?

00:07:15.977 --> 00:07:17.562
[KISUKE] This is a
story that the children

00:07:17.604 --> 00:07:19.564
in the village are told.

00:07:19.606 --> 00:07:22.817
And it begins with
a man and his wife.

00:07:24.027 --> 00:07:25.862
[KISUKE] They lived here,
in this forest.

00:07:25.904 --> 00:07:27.364
Though they tried
for many years,

00:07:27.405 --> 00:07:29.866
the couple could not
conceive a child.

00:07:29.908 --> 00:07:31.326
This depressed the husband,

00:07:31.368 --> 00:07:34.746
who began spending more and
more time away from home.

00:07:34.788 --> 00:07:36.790
His wife was a strange woman.

00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:39.626
She would sometimes be seen
talking to trees and flowers,

00:07:39.668 --> 00:07:43.171
and eventually began wandering
around the forest at night.

00:07:43.213 --> 00:07:44.589
Then, one day,

00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:47.842
she told her husband she
thought she might be pregnant.

00:07:47.884 --> 00:07:50.428
The husband grew
suspicious of his wife.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.848
So one night, he followed
her into the forest.

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:56.309
That's when he saw it.

00:07:56.351 --> 00:07:59.062
His wife,
blissful and enamored,

00:07:59.104 --> 00:08:02.190
embracing a white bamboo tree.

00:08:02.232 --> 00:08:05.443
Frightened and confused,
the husband ran away.

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:09.447
But the villagers chastised him,
and he soon returned home.

00:08:09.489 --> 00:08:11.157
There, he found his wife

00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:15.537
cradling a bamboo shoot as
if it were a newborn baby.

00:08:18.123 --> 00:08:20.250
She gave birth to
a bamboo shoot?

00:08:20.291 --> 00:08:22.711
[KISUKE]
Yeah. That's what they say.

00:08:22.752 --> 00:08:24.504
[GINKO] Maybe she was
just trying to taunt him

00:08:24.546 --> 00:08:25.797
into leaving her.

00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:27.382
That's what all the
villagers thought,

00:08:27.424 --> 00:08:31.261
as well, and In the end,
the husband did run away.

00:08:31.302 --> 00:08:33.805
Years later, when I was a boy,

00:08:33.847 --> 00:08:37.350
we went into the forest to
see this "bamboo child".

00:08:37.392 --> 00:08:39.644
She looked like a normal girl.

00:08:39.686 --> 00:08:43.023
That girl was Setsu.

00:08:43.064 --> 00:08:46.234
By that time, her mother
had already passed on.

00:08:46.276 --> 00:08:48.820
We thought she might
be lonely, so I often came by

00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:52.073
with my little sister
and some friends to play.

00:08:52.115 --> 00:08:55.493
But we all sensed that there was
something different about Setsu.

00:08:55.535 --> 00:08:58.788
She never ate, water was
all she would drink,

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:02.208
and she would never
leave the forest.

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:05.086
But we all liked, her
just the same.

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:10.091
Then, one day,
we came into this forest

00:09:10.133 --> 00:09:12.510
and couldn't find our way out.

00:09:12.552 --> 00:09:15.138
We went in circles,
over and over.

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:17.098
Soon after, one by one,

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:19.976
I began to lose
sight of the others.

00:09:20.018 --> 00:09:24.898
Before I realized it,
I was the only one left.

00:09:24.939 --> 00:09:27.150
The next day, those who
made it back to the village

00:09:27.192 --> 00:09:28.735
came looking for me.

00:09:28.777 --> 00:09:29.819
But once they found me,

00:09:29.861 --> 00:09:32.906
they discovered they were
unable to find their way out.

00:09:32.947 --> 00:09:35.366
[GINKO chuckles] So even though
you knew what would happen,

00:09:35.408 --> 00:09:37.243
you still dragged
me into all this?

00:09:37.285 --> 00:09:39.162
[laughs]
Sorry about that.

00:09:39.204 --> 00:09:43.666
You're an outsider, I... wanted
to see what would happen.

00:09:43.708 --> 00:09:46.669
After that, I moved into
Setsu's house with my sister,

00:09:46.711 --> 00:09:48.546
who was my only family.

00:09:48.588 --> 00:09:50.757
Everyone in the village
helped us out with food,

00:09:50.799 --> 00:09:54.385
clothing, and whatever
else we needed.

00:09:54.427 --> 00:09:56.179
They were all so kind.

00:09:56.221 --> 00:09:59.974
My sister and I were practically
raised by the village.

00:10:00.016 --> 00:10:02.769
They... were like family.

00:10:02.811 --> 00:10:04.729
It was wonderful.

00:10:06.022 --> 00:10:07.982
[KISUKE]
But, as time passed,

00:10:08.024 --> 00:10:11.444
fewer and fewer villagers
stopped by to see us.

00:10:13.655 --> 00:10:15.281
Kisuke?

00:10:15.323 --> 00:10:18.243
Are you lonely?

00:10:18.284 --> 00:10:20.578
Not at all.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.038
I'm glad.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.415
That's good to know.

00:10:24.457 --> 00:10:27.377
[KISUKE] In time,
Setsu became pregnant.

00:10:29.045 --> 00:10:30.797
[KISUKE]
But...

00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:35.844
[BABY crying]

00:10:36.845 --> 00:10:38.471
[KISUKE] That was
when I felt the truth

00:10:38.513 --> 00:10:41.850
behind Setsu's origin....

00:10:41.891 --> 00:10:44.102
...for the very first time.

00:10:47.856 --> 00:10:50.567
The midwife ran back
to the village,

00:10:50.608 --> 00:10:54.070
and no one else has ever come
to this place since then.

00:10:54.112 --> 00:10:55.905
That's the story...

00:10:55.947 --> 00:10:58.241
Though you probably
don't believe me.

00:10:58.283 --> 00:11:01.828
Well, it is astounding.

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:05.165
So, this <i>"magaridake"</i>
you mentioned before.

00:11:05.206 --> 00:11:07.041
What is it?

00:11:07.083 --> 00:11:11.880
It's a bamboo by name,
but it's not a plant.

00:11:11.921 --> 00:11:13.464
In a bamboo forest,

00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:16.634
all of the bamboo trees
share the same roots.

00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:19.345
Together, they are one, or you
could say they make up

00:11:19.387 --> 00:11:21.973
a family of
successive generations.

00:11:22.015 --> 00:11:25.268
The <i>magaridake</i> are <i>mushi</i> that
live off of these roots,

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:27.896
posing as one of the family.

00:11:27.937 --> 00:11:31.691
They grow by taking in nutrients
from the roots of the bamboo.

00:11:31.733 --> 00:11:34.068
In return, they give
back elements

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:35.820
that help make the forest green,

00:11:35.862 --> 00:11:38.948
expanding the bamboo's
size and family.

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:43.286
Your wife was born from
a <i>mushi</i> and a human.

00:11:43.328 --> 00:11:46.122
We <i>mushi</i> masters
call them <i>"oniko".</i>

00:11:46.164 --> 00:11:48.708
Their existence
is extremely rare.

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:53.129
[GINKO] A little too much
to take in all at once?

00:11:53.171 --> 00:11:54.088
[KISUKE]
No.

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:57.258
Not after seeing how my daughter
looked when she was born.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:00.720
Whatever her parents were,
It doesn't matter.

00:12:00.762 --> 00:12:02.722
She's still...

00:12:02.764 --> 00:12:04.474
...Setsu.

00:12:04.515 --> 00:12:07.894
I know the people down in the
village might not think so,

00:12:07.936 --> 00:12:11.064
but if they ever meet her,
then they'll understand.

00:12:11.105 --> 00:12:11.522
Who knows?

00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:15.193
Maybe one day, we'll all live
in the village together.

00:12:15.235 --> 00:12:18.446
[GINKO] So that's why you
want to leave this forest?

00:12:18.488 --> 00:12:20.156
Yes.

00:12:20.198 --> 00:12:24.035
Also, I'm worried
about my little sister.

00:12:24.077 --> 00:12:26.913
I hope she hasn't
suffered because of me.

00:12:28.873 --> 00:12:30.708
[GINKO]
I have an idea.

00:12:48.935 --> 00:12:50.395
[GINKO]
If you connect all the points

00:12:50.436 --> 00:12:52.313
where he suddenly
changes direction,

00:12:52.355 --> 00:12:54.899
it makes an almost
perfect circle.

00:12:54.941 --> 00:12:56.985
That's what happens.

00:12:57.026 --> 00:12:58.778
You can't get out.

00:13:05.743 --> 00:13:09.747
[GINKO] And at the center of
the circle... is that stalk.

00:13:17.797 --> 00:13:19.257
[GINKO] Is that the
water that gives life

00:13:19.299 --> 00:13:21.301
to you and your daughter?

00:13:23.177 --> 00:13:24.429
[SETSU]
Yes.

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:26.556
[GINKO]
Could you share some with me?

00:13:28.433 --> 00:13:30.435
No, I'm sorry... I can't.

00:13:30.476 --> 00:13:32.061
My mother told me that
I shouldn't give any

00:13:32.103 --> 00:13:35.481
of this water to anyone,
especially outsiders.

00:13:35.523 --> 00:13:36.941
Even Kisuke?

00:13:38.693 --> 00:13:40.153
Well, actually.

00:13:40.194 --> 00:13:42.905
I did give him some...

00:13:42.947 --> 00:13:45.199
...back when we were
still just children.

00:13:47.702 --> 00:13:49.537
[GINKO]
I see.

00:13:49.579 --> 00:13:51.539
It must be hard on you,

00:13:51.581 --> 00:13:54.876
being hated by the villagers.

00:13:54.917 --> 00:13:56.461
It can be.

00:13:56.502 --> 00:13:58.379
But, I don't mind.

00:13:58.421 --> 00:14:00.965
My husband and daughter
are all I need.

00:14:01.007 --> 00:14:04.719
It's sad that Kisuke's not
able to leave the forest,

00:14:04.761 --> 00:14:07.055
but honestly...

00:14:07.096 --> 00:14:10.433
...In a way, I'm happy.

00:14:15.188 --> 00:14:18.524
[GINKO] Well, I'll just have
to borrow some then.

00:14:18.566 --> 00:14:21.152
I'm sorry, but I
have to do this.

00:14:29.494 --> 00:14:32.455
[GINKO]
Just as I suspected.

00:14:32.497 --> 00:14:34.165
I'm trapped.

00:14:34.207 --> 00:14:36.501
I can't get out.

00:14:36.542 --> 00:14:38.461
Now this...

00:14:38.503 --> 00:14:40.213
...is going to be a problem.

00:14:48.554 --> 00:14:51.391
[giggles]

00:14:51.432 --> 00:14:54.018
Ah... It's that time
of year again.

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:56.062
The leaves are starting to fall.

00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:01.275
Mother bamboo is giving
these leave to her children.

00:15:01.317 --> 00:15:05.154
They're the food that will
help them grow big and strong.

00:15:05.196 --> 00:15:08.157
Uh... Which one is the mother?

00:15:08.199 --> 00:15:09.826
They all are.

00:15:09.867 --> 00:15:12.620
They're raising their
children together.

00:15:13.871 --> 00:15:15.748
Your daddy...

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:19.168
...always thinks about the
village this time of the year.

00:15:20.837 --> 00:15:23.089
[KISUKE]
It's big and full of life.

00:15:23.131 --> 00:15:27.260
You wouldn't believe how
beautiful the sun is there.

00:15:27.301 --> 00:15:29.720
I wish I could show it to you.

00:15:29.762 --> 00:15:31.597
Maybe someday...

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:41.441
[sighs]

00:15:50.283 --> 00:15:53.369
Will things be all right?

00:15:53.411 --> 00:15:55.329
Kisuke...

00:15:55.371 --> 00:15:57.665
He's not going to leave, is he?

00:15:57.707 --> 00:15:59.083
--[footsteps]
--[SETSU gasps]

00:16:03.337 --> 00:16:06.507
Then... you've found
what's causing this?

00:16:06.549 --> 00:16:07.717
Yeah.

00:16:07.758 --> 00:16:12.680
Unlike plants, <i>mushi</i> have
will, drive, and motivation.

00:16:12.722 --> 00:16:14.974
They send out commands to
each part of themselves

00:16:15.016 --> 00:16:17.059
to help carry out this will.

00:16:17.101 --> 00:16:19.395
So in this case,
the <i>mushi's</i> body

00:16:19.437 --> 00:16:23.566
is the forest surrounding
this one central stalk...

00:16:23.608 --> 00:16:25.943
The medium that conveys
the stalk's will,

00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:28.112
is the water flowing through it.

00:16:28.154 --> 00:16:30.615
The same water
that Setsu drinks.

00:16:30.656 --> 00:16:33.784
As you can see, normal water
shows no reaction

00:16:33.826 --> 00:16:35.953
when placed near the stalk.

00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:37.413
But...

00:16:39.499 --> 00:16:41.083
Simply carrying this water

00:16:41.125 --> 00:16:43.794
places you under the
influence of the <i>mushi.</i>

00:16:43.836 --> 00:16:47.757
Obviously, those who drink
it are also under its will.

00:16:47.798 --> 00:16:51.511
Just being near it, is enough
for it to have an effect.

00:16:53.387 --> 00:16:55.681
[KISUKE sighs]
It sure is hot today.

00:16:55.723 --> 00:16:58.351
I'm thirsty.

00:16:58.392 --> 00:17:01.395
[SETSU] You can have a
sip of this, if you like.

00:17:01.437 --> 00:17:03.356
[gasps]

00:17:03.397 --> 00:17:06.901
As for Setsu, I don't think
she knew about any of this.

00:17:06.943 --> 00:17:08.277
You're right.

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:11.364
She couldn't have known, but
what are we supposed to do now?

00:17:11.405 --> 00:17:13.115
That's the problem.

00:17:13.157 --> 00:17:16.244
We need to completely remove
that water from your body.

00:17:16.285 --> 00:17:19.789
But frankly,
I'm not sure how to.

00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:21.332
Now listen.

00:17:21.374 --> 00:17:22.750
There is one other method,

00:17:22.792 --> 00:17:25.836
but it's something that I'd
really rather not have to do.

00:17:27.838 --> 00:17:32.468
I'm not sure... what effect
it might have on the others.

00:17:33.553 --> 00:17:35.263
Oh...

00:17:37.848 --> 00:17:39.600
[KISUKE]
I see.

00:17:39.642 --> 00:17:40.726
In that case,

00:17:40.768 --> 00:17:43.896
I can live with things
the way they are.

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:04.000
[SETSU]
So, it was you.

00:18:04.041 --> 00:18:08.212
You were the one keeping
Kisuke here for me.

00:18:08.254 --> 00:18:09.880
Thank you.

00:18:11.841 --> 00:18:13.926
And I'm sorry...

00:18:16.554 --> 00:18:18.723
[SETSU shouts]

00:18:21.183 --> 00:18:25.229
[shouting continues]

00:18:27.189 --> 00:18:29.150
What's going on?

00:18:30.568 --> 00:18:33.321
[GINKO]
You won't be able to do it.

00:18:33.362 --> 00:18:36.407
Because you're one
of its children.

00:18:36.449 --> 00:18:39.285
You're a part of
the <i>mushi's</i> body.

00:18:39.327 --> 00:18:42.330
Just as your limbs won't
go against your brain.

00:18:43.623 --> 00:18:46.417
[GINKO] Were you listening
the whole time?

00:18:46.459 --> 00:18:48.669
[SETSU]
Kisuke...

00:18:48.711 --> 00:18:50.796
He's trapped here because of me.

00:18:50.838 --> 00:18:54.508
But, I don't think
he's truly unhappy.

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:57.053
[SETSU] Kisuke brought
joy into my life.

00:18:57.094 --> 00:18:59.513
A common woman like me.

00:18:59.555 --> 00:19:04.435
And in return, I took his
village away from him.

00:19:04.477 --> 00:19:07.063
He told me he didn't care
where I was from or

00:19:07.104 --> 00:19:08.814
who my parents are.

00:19:08.856 --> 00:19:10.858
None of that mattered,

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:14.028
because Kisuke's
in love with... Me!

Setsu!

00:19:50.815 --> 00:19:52.942
Now where could she have gone?

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:04.954
It's the village!

[KISUKE'S SISTER]

00:20:13.504 --> 00:20:14.296
Yes!

00:20:14.338 --> 00:20:15.840
So, have you been well?

00:20:15.881 --> 00:20:17.091
[KISUKE'S SISTER]
Is that...

00:20:17.133 --> 00:20:19.051
Is that the child?

[KISUKE]
Yes!

00:20:20.636 --> 00:20:21.762
[KISUKE'S SISTER]
Go away.

Wait! Listen to me!

Don't bring that thing down

to the village ever again!

00:20:26.892 --> 00:20:29.812
I have a child of my own now.

Please, don't make my child
suffer the same way I did.

Let's go home.

I bet she's there
waiting for us.

I've been told that for a while,

00:20:54.879 --> 00:20:57.506
the three of them
lived happily together.

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:04.597
[GINKO]
But then...

00:21:04.638 --> 00:21:08.434
Six months later, when I
returned to the bamboo forest

00:21:08.476 --> 00:21:12.521
to see the effects of cutting
down the parent stalk.

00:21:12.563 --> 00:21:14.064
The <i>magaridake.</i>

00:21:14.106 --> 00:21:15.733
They're all gone.

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:24.867
[KISUKE]
It's you...

00:21:28.496 --> 00:21:32.082
[KISUKE] After that, the white
bamboo stalks wilted and died,

00:21:32.124 --> 00:21:33.834
one after the other...

00:21:33.876 --> 00:21:38.672
Just like... Just like
my wife and daughter.

00:21:38.714 --> 00:21:40.758
That water.

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:43.177
They needed it to survive.

00:21:44.845 --> 00:21:46.764
They shriveled up...

00:21:46.806 --> 00:21:49.809
...like dead trees.

00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:52.770
They suffered so much.

00:21:52.812 --> 00:21:55.231
Setsu shouldn't have done that.

00:21:55.272 --> 00:21:58.108
That was her parent.

00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:00.778
I made her do it.

00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:04.031
Because I couldn't forget
about the village.

00:22:15.543 --> 00:22:19.713
Ah... Looks like it's about
that time of year again.

00:22:21.757 --> 00:22:23.676
A white bamboo...

00:22:23.717 --> 00:22:25.261
When did that--

00:22:29.098 --> 00:22:31.475
[BABIES crying]

00:22:31.517 --> 00:22:32.810
[KISUKE]
That sounds like...

00:22:32.852 --> 00:22:35.896
...babies crying.

00:22:35.938 --> 00:22:38.983
It's coming from the
direction of the graves.

00:23:48.218 --> 00:23:51.430
