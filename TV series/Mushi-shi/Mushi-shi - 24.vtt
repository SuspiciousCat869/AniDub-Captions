Make the fire...

Nightfall is coming.

00:00:18.185 --> 00:00:20.270
Light the fire...

00:00:20.312 --> 00:00:23.065
Darkness is coming.

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:25.275
Hide the fire...

00:00:25.317 --> 00:00:27.611
...or the flames of the dead...

00:00:27.653 --> 00:00:29.363
...will possess it.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.875
[YAHAGI]
That fire...

00:00:45.921 --> 00:00:47.047
[YAHAGI gasps]

00:00:49.424 --> 00:00:53.303
[YAHAGI]
No! Stay away from that fire!

What is this?

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.327
My punishment?

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.749
[YAHAGI]
Was I wrong?

00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:26.003
Was I just being arrogant?

00:01:26.044 --> 00:01:29.464
Maybe I should have
done as he suggested.

00:01:29.506 --> 00:01:31.842
Or maybe it was hopeless
from the beginning.

[footsteps]

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.193
Looks like I'm getting close.

[GINKO]
Hey!

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.581
I've heard that a <i>mushi</i> master
lives in this village.

00:02:02.623 --> 00:02:03.457
Is that true?

00:02:03.498 --> 00:02:05.000
What's he mean?

00:02:05.042 --> 00:02:08.045
I bet he's talking about Yahagi.

00:02:08.086 --> 00:02:11.381
She's down in the fields
with Dad and the others.

00:02:11.423 --> 00:02:12.758
A bunch of weird weeds

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:15.802
that no one has ever seen
before started growing there.

00:02:15.844 --> 00:02:18.513
They're killing the trees
on the mountain.

00:02:18.555 --> 00:02:20.849
[VILLAGER A]
It's decided then.

00:02:20.891 --> 00:02:24.394
We'll split up and cut down all
the trees around the village.

00:02:24.436 --> 00:02:25.437
[VILLAGER B]
Right.

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.192
[NAO]
Yahagi!

00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:32.444
You two again?!

00:02:32.486 --> 00:02:35.405
Didn't I tell you
not to come here?

00:02:35.447 --> 00:02:36.365
[gasps]

00:02:36.406 --> 00:02:37.199
What happened here?

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.408
[NAO groans]

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.827
We brought you a visitor!

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:42.829
You did?

00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:43.872
[gasps]

00:02:43.914 --> 00:02:46.416
Stay away from that weed!

00:02:46.458 --> 00:02:47.751
[GINKO]
Interesting...

00:02:47.793 --> 00:02:50.545
If it was just one plant,
you wouldn't notice it.

00:02:50.587 --> 00:02:52.089
But with so many...

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.218
This thing's obviously a <i>mushi;</i>
there's no way to miss it.

00:02:56.259 --> 00:03:00.263
You're not a...
<i>mushi</i> master, are you?

00:03:00.305 --> 00:03:02.265
Yes, my name is Ginko.

00:03:02.307 --> 00:03:04.893
I heard a new species
had been identified.

00:03:04.935 --> 00:03:07.270
I thought I'd do
a little research.

00:03:07.312 --> 00:03:09.606
[YAHAGI]
You're too late.

00:03:09.648 --> 00:03:12.359
The research is done;
it's time to act.

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:17.030
[splashing]

00:03:17.072 --> 00:03:18.573

--[MIKU laughing]
--Stop squirming!

--[MIKU laughing]
--It stings!

00:03:21.493 --> 00:03:22.661
--[MIKU laughing]
--It's fine, okay?

00:03:22.703 --> 00:03:24.371
[GINKO] I thought I
recognized your name.

00:03:24.413 --> 00:03:26.498
I've read several
of your papers.

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.375
Your work is quite impressive.

00:03:28.417 --> 00:03:29.710
I really mean it.

00:03:31.837 --> 00:03:33.422
But I have to admit...

00:03:33.463 --> 00:03:35.799
I didn't expect you
to be a young woman.

00:03:35.841 --> 00:03:37.551
Thanks, I think.

00:03:37.592 --> 00:03:41.596
Anyway... I'm very interested
in your new findings.

00:03:41.638 --> 00:03:43.432
Do you think I could see them?

00:03:46.017 --> 00:03:47.561
[YAHAGI]
They're still incomplete.

00:03:47.602 --> 00:03:52.107
Incomplete? But you said
your research was done.

00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:56.027
[YAHAGI] There's no need, nor is
there time for further research.

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.487
Tomorrow...

00:03:57.529 --> 00:04:01.199
...we're going to burn the
entire surface of the mountain.

00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:02.659
--[MIKU] Huh?
--What?

00:04:02.701 --> 00:04:05.162
You're joking!
The whole mountain?

00:04:05.203 --> 00:04:05.787
That's right.

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:10.041
[NAO] But why? It's only
the weed that's bad.

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:12.085
[YAHAGI]
It's the only thing we can do.

00:04:12.127 --> 00:04:14.838
[MIKU] Will the animals
on the mountain die?

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.423
[YAHAGI]
We're chasing them away

00:04:16.465 --> 00:04:19.634
and doing whatever we can to
prevent them from being harmed.

00:04:19.676 --> 00:04:21.303
--Wait, but--
--[YAHAGI] Listen.

00:04:21.344 --> 00:04:23.680
We must do this
to stop that weed.

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:29.060
Otherwise... everyone in the
village could be in danger next.

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:31.605
Please, try to understand.

00:04:31.646 --> 00:04:32.939
We must.

00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:35.692
It's our only chance
to save ourselves.

00:04:35.734 --> 00:04:37.152
[GINKO]
I wonder...

00:04:37.194 --> 00:04:40.614
Are you absolutely sure
there's no other way?

00:04:40.655 --> 00:04:43.158
[YAHAGI]
Yes... I'm sure.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.826
We're running out of time.

00:04:46.828 --> 00:04:47.913
I might be able to help

00:04:47.954 --> 00:04:50.373
if I knew more about this.

00:04:50.415 --> 00:04:52.918
Why don't you tell me
what's been going on?

00:04:56.338 --> 00:04:57.506
All right.

00:05:01.092 --> 00:05:03.303
[YAHAGI]
It started two months ago.

00:05:05.263 --> 00:05:07.766
[YAHAGI]
We were clearing a field,

00:05:07.808 --> 00:05:10.185
getting ready for
the spring planting.

00:05:11.937 --> 00:05:13.104
[YAHAGI]
While working,

00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:16.691
we turned up a
giant black boulder.

00:05:16.733 --> 00:05:18.109
We're near an old volcano,

00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:21.988
so there's a great deal of
volcanic rock in the area.

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.033
We dug it up and dumped it
in a corner of the field.

00:05:26.743 --> 00:05:28.370
[YAHAGI]
The next day...

00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:32.999
Someone noticed a weed growing
out of a crack in the boulder.

00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:35.585
But no one thought
anything about it.

00:05:39.631 --> 00:05:41.216
[YAHAGI]
Three days later...

00:05:41.258 --> 00:05:43.343
...after a heavy rainstorm...

00:05:43.385 --> 00:05:46.596
...we found that the field
was overrun by weeds.

00:05:48.014 --> 00:05:51.601
[YAHAGI] They all seemed
to be connected at the root.

00:05:51.643 --> 00:05:55.021
No matter how much we'd
cut at them or pull at them,

00:05:55.063 --> 00:05:57.190
they'd grow back immediately.

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.738
[YAHAGI] By the time I realized
it was something unnatural...

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.157
...it was too late.

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:07.909
Their blossoms released a poison

00:06:07.951 --> 00:06:10.328
that withered the
surrounding plants.

00:06:12.122 --> 00:06:15.292
[YAHAGI]
Nothing affects their vitality.

00:06:15.333 --> 00:06:19.337
Every effort to exterminate
them... has failed.

00:06:21.756 --> 00:06:24.593
They've completely
overrun the mountainside.

00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:26.887
And now, they're growing
towards the village.

00:06:29.264 --> 00:06:30.599
[GINKO]
Even so...

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.977
You're taking a big risk by
burning the whole mountain.

00:06:34.019 --> 00:06:36.980
Plus, it's an unknown <i>mushi.</i>

00:06:37.022 --> 00:06:39.691
Who knows how fire
will affect it?

00:06:39.733 --> 00:06:41.651
Gather all the people you can.

00:06:41.693 --> 00:06:44.905
Get them out of
the village quickly.

00:06:44.946 --> 00:06:47.741
We need to learn more
about this <i>mushi.</i>

00:06:47.782 --> 00:06:50.368
So you think that we should just
give up and let the crops die?

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.038
The village won't survive
the winter that way!

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:55.749
Everyone's life is at stake!

00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:00.378
I understand that, but we
can't afford to be hasty.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.757
You're saying that we should
simply accept a few casualties?

00:07:03.798 --> 00:07:05.091
I'm saying...

00:07:05.133 --> 00:07:06.927
We shouldn't gamble
with people's lives

00:07:06.968 --> 00:07:08.637
without more knowledge.

00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:13.308
[YAHAGI]
Point taken.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:18.146
But... this is no time for us
to have a scholarly debate.

00:07:18.188 --> 00:07:21.066
Not now. The villagers
are close to panicking.

00:07:21.107 --> 00:07:23.568
[GINKO]
And what about you?

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:24.736
I know it's frustrating

00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:27.697
not being able to
identify that <i>mushi.</i>

00:07:27.739 --> 00:07:30.617
But you can't give in to fear.

00:07:30.659 --> 00:07:32.369
I grew up here.

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:35.455
These people are
depending on me.

00:07:35.497 --> 00:07:38.124
And I'll do whatever it takes...

00:07:38.166 --> 00:07:39.542
...to protect them.

00:07:40.961 --> 00:07:43.880
[YAHAGI] You're welcome
to take the report.

00:07:43.922 --> 00:07:46.925
Maybe you can be of help
in my next investigation.

00:07:48.426 --> 00:07:52.305
But now... just go
and leave us alone.

00:07:52.347 --> 00:07:55.141

Aww... there goes the big oak!

The cherry tree's gone, too!

[GINKO]
Hey!

00:08:14.369 --> 00:08:16.162
[GINKO]
You've got to stop this.

00:08:17.622 --> 00:08:18.957
And who are you?

00:08:18.999 --> 00:08:20.709
I know you want to
protect your village,

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:22.293
but are you sure
you're not destroying

00:08:22.335 --> 00:08:24.504
more than you're saving?

00:08:24.546 --> 00:08:25.422
Think about it.

00:08:25.463 --> 00:08:28.008
I'm begging you to reconsider.

00:08:28.049 --> 00:08:31.970
Look, Mister, no one's happy
about destroying the forest.

00:08:32.012 --> 00:08:33.388
We must.

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:35.765
If we don't, we and
our families might die.

00:08:35.807 --> 00:08:38.601
[VILLAGER D] You're that other
<i>mushi</i> master, aren't you?

00:08:38.643 --> 00:08:41.688
We already have a great master
right here in the village.

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:44.190
What would an outsider
know about us?

00:08:44.232 --> 00:08:46.651
I'll tell you what I know.

00:08:46.693 --> 00:08:49.154
You're acting like a pack of
frightened monkeys, not men.

00:08:49.195 --> 00:08:50.196
[VILLAGER C gasps]

00:08:50.238 --> 00:08:52.198
[GINKO]
Running around wildly...

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.075
Blindly lashing out...

00:08:54.117 --> 00:08:55.785
Bastard! How dare you!

00:08:55.827 --> 00:08:58.079
Face your fear like
rational men...

00:08:58.121 --> 00:09:00.206
...instead of burning
it like a mob.

00:09:00.248 --> 00:09:01.750
We are facing it.

00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:04.377
That's what people have always
used fire for, isn't it?

00:09:06.046 --> 00:09:09.466
We should use our
intelligence to fight this.

00:09:09.507 --> 00:09:12.677
Isn't that how we mastered
fire? With intelligence?

00:09:12.719 --> 00:09:14.471
Very glib.

00:09:14.512 --> 00:09:17.057
But you know what
I'm talking about.

00:09:17.098 --> 00:09:18.600
Didn't I tell you to leave?

00:09:18.641 --> 00:09:19.601
We don't need you.

00:09:19.642 --> 00:09:21.186
[VILLAGER D]
Leave us alone!

00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:22.228
[VILLAGER C]
Come on!

00:09:24.981 --> 00:09:26.274
[YAHAGI]
All right, everyone...

00:09:26.316 --> 00:09:29.486
Please, calm down and listen.

00:09:29.527 --> 00:09:32.072
I found the weed at
the edge of the village.

00:09:32.113 --> 00:09:33.490
[VILLAGERS gasp]

00:09:33.531 --> 00:09:35.700
Let's finish with the trees...

00:09:35.742 --> 00:09:38.328
...and set the mountain
on fire by nightfall.

00:09:43.917 --> 00:09:45.543
[GINKO groans]

00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:46.628
Ow...

00:09:47.712 --> 00:09:51.091
Well that...
could've gone better.

00:09:56.638 --> 00:09:58.098
[GINKO]
No doubt about it...

00:09:58.139 --> 00:09:59.933
She's good.

00:09:59.974 --> 00:10:03.478
She must hate having to burn
it before we can learn more.

00:10:05.647 --> 00:10:08.691
[GINKO] No one's going
to listen to me.

00:10:08.733 --> 00:10:11.694
She's the only one who
can put a stop to this.

00:10:18.827 --> 00:10:20.078
[GINKO]
Maybe...

00:10:22.956 --> 00:10:24.749
[thud]

00:10:24.791 --> 00:10:26.709
[crack]

00:10:26.751 --> 00:10:27.502
[crash]

00:10:27.544 --> 00:10:29.504
[GINKO grunts]

00:10:29.546 --> 00:10:33.091
This is wrong; I can feel it.

00:10:33.133 --> 00:10:36.886
That <i>mushi</i> was inside
of a volcanic rock.

00:10:36.928 --> 00:10:40.098
Setting it on fire is
just asking for trouble.

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:51.776
Set the fires.

00:11:07.959 --> 00:11:09.002
[footsteps]

00:11:09.043 --> 00:11:13.548
[GINKO panting]

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:15.133
[gasps]

00:11:47.957 --> 00:11:50.793
It's done. Now, we'll survive.

00:11:50.835 --> 00:11:52.086
Maybe.

00:11:53.922 --> 00:11:56.549
[VILLAGER F]
But we destroyed everything.

00:12:04.807 --> 00:12:06.142
[crack]

00:12:06.184 --> 00:12:06.768
[gasps]

00:12:06.809 --> 00:12:10.730
[cracking continues]

00:12:10.772 --> 00:12:13.483
[YAHAGI]
That noise... What is it?

00:12:13.524 --> 00:12:21.282
[cracking continues]

00:12:21.324 --> 00:12:23.409
Over there! Look!

00:12:23.451 --> 00:12:25.245
What are those things?

00:12:29.707 --> 00:12:30.750
[GINKO gasps]

00:12:32.377 --> 00:12:34.087
[GINKO]
Those flames...

00:12:34.128 --> 00:12:35.713
They're <i>kagebi!</i>

00:12:42.762 --> 00:12:45.223
All of you! Quick! Go home!

00:12:45.265 --> 00:12:47.517
Keep the fires away
from the homes--!

00:12:51.104 --> 00:12:52.063
[GINKO]
Hey!

00:12:52.105 --> 00:12:54.399
Cover your pots and containers!

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.567
Hurry and tell your neighbors!

00:12:56.609 --> 00:13:00.113
Do it quickly, before those
fireballs have a chance to nest!

00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:03.449
[YAHAGI]
Do as he says! Hurry!

00:13:05.493 --> 00:13:07.829
[YAHAGI]
Everyone, listen carefully.

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:09.414
That thing looks like fire,

00:13:09.455 --> 00:13:13.042
but it's actually called
a <i>kagebi--</i> a shadow fire.

00:13:13.084 --> 00:13:16.087
It usually only appears
on cold and rainy days.

00:13:16.129 --> 00:13:19.048
It sucks the body heat from
those who get too near,

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:21.718
thinking it a real fire.

00:13:21.759 --> 00:13:24.887
On warm days, it likes
to lurk in narrow spaces,

00:13:24.929 --> 00:13:27.140
like pots or hollow trees.

00:13:27.181 --> 00:13:29.684
Most of these have
probably nested already.

00:13:29.726 --> 00:13:33.354
Possibly even somewhere
near your homes.

00:13:33.396 --> 00:13:34.439
From now on...

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.483
Be careful when you
approach any fire.

00:13:37.525 --> 00:13:40.236
You could end up freezing
to death before you know it,

00:13:40.278 --> 00:13:42.363
just by trying to get warm.

00:13:42.405 --> 00:13:45.033
You tell us be careful...
but what should we look for?

00:13:45.074 --> 00:13:47.410
A fire that seems to
be only lukewarm...

00:13:47.452 --> 00:13:50.038
...is bound to be a <i>kagebi.</i>

00:13:50.079 --> 00:13:53.374
Hidden inside these things
is a <i>mushi</i> called a <i>hidane.</i>

00:13:53.416 --> 00:13:56.794
This <i>mushi</i> is the true form
of these ghostly flames.

00:13:56.836 --> 00:13:59.339
It thrives by absorbing heat.

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:00.840
But everything will be fine.

00:14:00.882 --> 00:14:02.633
All we have to do is take care.

00:14:02.675 --> 00:14:04.344
No one is going to
get hurt, all right?

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:10.516
[GINKO] Things have gotten
out of hand, haven't they?

00:14:10.558 --> 00:14:13.353
Who knew that weed would
turn out to be <i>hidane</i> larva?

00:14:13.394 --> 00:14:15.938
[YAHAGI]
Still, we can deal with <i>hidane.</i>

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:18.775
I'm familiar with
all the literature.

00:14:18.816 --> 00:14:21.361
It's a shame it
wasn't a new species.

00:14:21.402 --> 00:14:25.198
But at least we identified
an unknown larval stage.

00:14:25.239 --> 00:14:27.033
That's a nice lecture.

00:14:27.075 --> 00:14:30.161
Don't take your
frustrations out on me.

00:14:30.203 --> 00:14:32.372
<i>Kagebi</i> can be very persistent.

00:14:32.413 --> 00:14:35.541
And no one else in the village
can deal with them but you.

00:14:35.583 --> 00:14:37.877
If things here should
start to get out of hand,

00:14:37.919 --> 00:14:39.921
send a letter to this address.

00:14:39.962 --> 00:14:41.756
And I'll come.

00:14:41.798 --> 00:14:44.467
It's payment for
reading your report.

00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:47.053
Don't take on too
much by yourself.

00:14:49.597 --> 00:14:51.057
[coughs]

00:14:57.772 --> 00:15:00.817
[VILLAGER I shudders]
I'm freezing...

00:15:00.858 --> 00:15:02.193
Time for fire.

00:15:06.114 --> 00:15:08.908
Damn it! Too damp...

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:10.785
Huh...?

00:15:10.827 --> 00:15:12.995
Must be embers
from the burning.

00:15:13.037 --> 00:15:14.539
Thank goodness.

00:15:31.013 --> 00:15:32.140
[MOTHER B shudders]

00:15:34.016 --> 00:15:36.602
Sure is chilly today.

00:15:36.644 --> 00:15:39.230
The room just won't
get warm at all.

00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:55.246
[YAHAGI] It looks like the weeds
have been exterminated.

00:15:55.288 --> 00:15:58.416
They probably won't
sprout up again.

00:15:58.458 --> 00:15:59.959
Now for the <i>kagebi...</i>

00:16:04.046 --> 00:16:05.047
[gasps]

00:16:06.466 --> 00:16:07.508
[gasps]

00:16:11.888 --> 00:16:14.849

00:16:14.891 --> 00:16:16.684
[VILLAGER L]
So's my grandfather!

00:16:16.726 --> 00:16:18.769
[VILLAGER M]
The people next door are, too!

00:16:22.565 --> 00:16:29.113
[YAHAGI chokes, coughs]

00:16:29.155 --> 00:16:29.906
[VILLAGERS gasp]

00:16:29.947 --> 00:16:31.532
[coughing continues]

00:16:31.574 --> 00:16:32.825
[VILLAGER K]
Yahagi...?

00:16:36.871 --> 00:16:40.208
[footsteps]

00:16:46.255 --> 00:16:47.840
Then what?

00:16:47.882 --> 00:16:51.344
Seven people... died outright.

00:16:51.385 --> 00:16:54.889
Others have suffered
internal frostbite...

00:16:54.931 --> 00:16:58.434
...after eating food cooked
by the heat of a <i>kagebi.</i>

00:17:00.186 --> 00:17:01.479
I thought...

00:17:01.521 --> 00:17:03.272
I'd warned them enough.

00:17:03.314 --> 00:17:04.607
I was wrong.

00:17:06.859 --> 00:17:09.320
And how are things now?

00:17:09.362 --> 00:17:11.113
It's starting to get better.

00:17:11.155 --> 00:17:12.990
Those who have frostbite
should recover

00:17:13.032 --> 00:17:15.326
if they're careful and rest.

00:17:15.368 --> 00:17:17.537
The villagers are finally
beginning to pay attention

00:17:17.578 --> 00:17:22.166
and be cautious... so we're
having fewer casualties.

00:17:22.208 --> 00:17:23.918
[GINKO]
And the <i>kagebi?</i>

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:27.129
When you crush the <i>hidane</i>
inside, they disappear.

00:17:27.171 --> 00:17:30.132
We should be rid of most
of them by this time.

00:17:30.174 --> 00:17:32.093
[GINKO]
So it's like the writings say.

00:17:32.134 --> 00:17:35.304
Kill the <i>mushi</i> and
the fire disappears.

00:17:35.346 --> 00:17:37.682
Why am I here?

00:17:37.723 --> 00:17:38.808
Because...

00:17:38.849 --> 00:17:42.019
I've discovered a life stage
not in the writings.

00:17:44.313 --> 00:17:46.232
Those weeds we found
in the rock that day

00:17:46.274 --> 00:17:48.985
sprout from the corpses
of those who died...

00:17:49.026 --> 00:17:51.904
...from having their
body heat drained away.

00:17:51.946 --> 00:17:52.738
[GINKO gasps]

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:56.284
Is that the problem you called
me back here to help you with?

00:17:56.325 --> 00:17:58.869
Oh, no. I can take
care of that myself.

00:17:58.911 --> 00:18:00.997
Then what is it?

00:18:01.038 --> 00:18:05.042
You see... I'm going to have
to leave the village soon.

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:08.379
[YAHAGI]
When we burned the mountain...

00:18:08.421 --> 00:18:11.340
...I inhaled a <i>kagebi.</i>

00:18:11.382 --> 00:18:15.720
The body is just a type
of container... isn't it?

00:18:15.761 --> 00:18:20.975
It's been there all along,
sapping my body heat.

00:18:21.017 --> 00:18:24.186
It felt as if I was
freezing... slowly...

00:18:24.228 --> 00:18:27.315
Now I'm coughing up weeds.

00:18:27.356 --> 00:18:28.649
So you see...

00:18:28.691 --> 00:18:31.694
I'm punished for my foolishness.

00:18:31.736 --> 00:18:34.655
The <i>hidane</i> have taken
root in my stomach...

00:18:34.697 --> 00:18:36.532
They're beginning to sprout.

00:18:38.909 --> 00:18:42.038
[YAHAGI] I've started to
cough up poison as well.

00:18:42.079 --> 00:18:45.333
I've already told everyone
I don't have much time left.

00:18:46.626 --> 00:18:50.463
[YAHAGI] I plan to leave soon
and go as far away as possible

00:18:50.504 --> 00:18:52.882
before my body is consumed.

00:18:52.923 --> 00:18:57.011
Before that, I must ask--
Will you take over here?

00:18:57.053 --> 00:18:59.388
With you in charge...
I won't ever have to worry

00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:02.058
about something like
this happening again.

00:19:03.476 --> 00:19:05.478
I can't.

00:19:05.519 --> 00:19:07.521
If it had been my
responsibility...

00:19:07.563 --> 00:19:10.691
...I don't know if I would
have acted differently.

00:19:10.733 --> 00:19:11.984
But this battle you started

00:19:12.026 --> 00:19:15.196
is going to continue
for years to come.

00:19:15.237 --> 00:19:19.158
You can't give up on it now and
leave it for your successors.

00:19:26.457 --> 00:19:27.375
[GINKO]
I've got an idea

00:19:27.416 --> 00:19:30.086
I've been thinking
about for some time.

00:19:30.127 --> 00:19:31.587
Let me give it a try.

00:19:32.672 --> 00:19:34.507
You're gonna catch a <i>kagebi?</i>

00:19:34.548 --> 00:19:38.010
Then what? You'll save Yahagi?

00:19:38.052 --> 00:19:39.720
We'll see.

00:19:39.762 --> 00:19:41.555
Hey, look!

00:19:46.852 --> 00:19:48.479
[YAHAGI]
What do you plan to do?

00:19:50.564 --> 00:19:54.026
[GINKO] The <i>hidane</i> are a cunning
piece of evolution, aren't they?

00:19:54.068 --> 00:19:55.486
It's clever.

00:19:55.528 --> 00:19:58.280
First, they emit a poison
that kills everything...

00:19:58.322 --> 00:20:01.409
which forces human beings
to set them on fire.

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:04.578
Once aflame, they mature,
take the fire's shape,

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:07.415
and lure people in to
steal their body heat.

00:20:07.456 --> 00:20:09.250
Do you see the irony?

00:20:09.291 --> 00:20:13.879
Man, the only animal that
uses fire, is used by fire.

00:20:13.921 --> 00:20:18.426
But still... the <i>hidane</i>
are only false fire.

00:20:18.467 --> 00:20:22.930
What will happen to the larva if
we set this false fire on them?

00:20:24.348 --> 00:20:25.516
So you think...

00:20:25.558 --> 00:20:27.810
To kill it when it's
in its weed form...

00:20:27.852 --> 00:20:30.563
...you just burn it with <i>kagebi.</i>

00:20:30.604 --> 00:20:32.273
Food cooked with <i>kagebi...</i>

00:20:32.314 --> 00:20:34.525
...will probably have
the same effect.

00:20:37.445 --> 00:20:40.489
But won't it burn me?
The frostbite?

00:20:40.531 --> 00:20:43.242
No kidding! I ate some
of that stuff before

00:20:43.284 --> 00:20:46.787
and it felt like my guts
were gonna burn up!

00:20:46.829 --> 00:20:48.164
Your choice.

00:20:55.296 --> 00:20:56.630
Yahagi!

00:21:06.807 --> 00:21:09.268
[YAHAGI groans, coughs]

00:21:11.228 --> 00:21:17.485
[coughing continues]

00:21:22.615 --> 00:21:24.825
It burned the weed!

00:21:24.867 --> 00:21:26.327
Give me more!

00:21:28.204 --> 00:21:29.622
Take it slow...

00:21:29.663 --> 00:21:32.124
Your body won't
hold up if you rush.

00:21:33.584 --> 00:21:36.086
[GINKO] You need to
get better gradually...

00:21:36.128 --> 00:21:37.880
...a little bit at a time.

00:21:44.512 --> 00:21:46.222
[GINKO]
And so...

00:21:46.263 --> 00:21:48.307
...coughing up leaves...

00:21:48.349 --> 00:21:50.684
...burning her insides...

00:21:50.726 --> 00:21:54.688
...she lived to protect her
village from the unknown...

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:58.150
...and does so to this day.

00:21:58.192 --> 00:21:59.026
[NAO]
Hey...

00:21:59.068 --> 00:22:02.112
We don't see many of those
<i>kagebi</i> anymore, do we?

00:22:02.154 --> 00:22:05.199
[MIKU] You think it's
'cause it's gotten warmer?

00:22:05.241 --> 00:22:07.243
[YAHAGI]
Maybe.

00:22:07.284 --> 00:22:08.244
But still...

00:22:08.285 --> 00:22:11.080
We don't know where
they could be hiding.

00:22:11.121 --> 00:22:12.540
Don't let your guard down.

00:22:12.581 --> 00:22:13.958
[yelps]

00:22:13.999 --> 00:22:15.209
[gasps]

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:24.176
Looks like it's flying
towards the valley!

00:22:24.218 --> 00:22:25.427
You're right...

00:22:25.469 --> 00:22:28.222
It might be looking for
some place a little colder.

00:22:29.223 --> 00:22:32.518
Or possibly...
it's going to hide.

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:35.396
And, holding its breath,

00:22:35.437 --> 00:22:38.357
wait patiently for
winter to come again.

00:23:44.173 --> 00:23:48.761
