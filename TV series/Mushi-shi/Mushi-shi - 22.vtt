00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:59.844
I didn't have a clue.

00:11:59.886 --> 00:12:02.680
But then, everything
changed when...

00:12:02.722 --> 00:12:06.017
...Isana grew older
and got bigger.

00:12:06.059 --> 00:12:11.648
Little by little, bit by bit,
her looks, her personality,

00:12:11.689 --> 00:12:13.441
even her facial
expressions began

00:12:13.483 --> 00:12:16.069
to resemble the mother
I knew and loved.

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:18.446
[MIO sobs]

00:12:18.488 --> 00:12:21.866
[MIO]
My mother is gone. I know that.

00:12:21.908 --> 00:12:27.956
But Isana looks just like her,
and she calls me "Mother".

00:12:27.997 --> 00:12:31.918
I may have given birth
to her and raised her,

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:36.089
but she doesn't
seem like my own.

00:12:51.896 --> 00:12:52.897
[GINKO]
Hm?

00:13:03.616 --> 00:13:06.703
[GINKO] They're coming
from the dragon shrine.

00:13:38.234 --> 00:13:39.402
[gasps]

00:13:46.367 --> 00:13:48.244
[GINKO]
Those globules...

00:13:48.286 --> 00:13:49.912
It's just a guess at this point,

00:13:49.954 --> 00:13:53.624
but I think they're created
by some sort of <i>mushi.</i>

00:13:53.666 --> 00:13:58.588
I can't say for sure and I
have nothing definitive yet,

00:13:58.629 --> 00:14:00.631
but it seems to make sense.

00:14:00.673 --> 00:14:03.551
Especially when you consider...

00:14:03.593 --> 00:14:06.179
...I found human
embryos inside them.

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:09.182
The beginning form of
life for every one of us.

00:14:09.223 --> 00:14:12.518
Someone swallows a globule,
and they become pregnant.

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:14.103
They then give birth to a child

00:14:14.187 --> 00:14:18.066
virtually identical to the loved
one they submerged at sea.

00:14:18.107 --> 00:14:19.609
That suggests these <i>mushi</i>

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:22.820
can return people to
their embryonic states.

00:14:22.862 --> 00:14:25.698
[MIO]
So does that mean... Isana?

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:26.824
That girl.

00:14:26.866 --> 00:14:30.828
She is physically identical
to your deceased mother.

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:35.291
And from here on, she's going
to resemble her more and more.

00:14:36.709 --> 00:14:41.631
However, she was born
and raised by you, Mio.

00:14:41.672 --> 00:14:43.674
She may look just like her,

00:14:43.716 --> 00:14:47.470
but she cannot turn
into your actual mother.

00:14:47.512 --> 00:14:50.598
In fact, as far as
Isana's concerned,

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:54.143
you are every bit her "mother."

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.271
[gasps]

00:14:57.313 --> 00:14:59.107
[MIO]
I see.

00:14:59.148 --> 00:15:02.443
So, that's how it is.

00:15:02.485 --> 00:15:05.196
I guess I'll find
a way to be strong.

00:15:14.539 --> 00:15:16.874
[ISANA]
Hey, Ginko!

00:15:19.127 --> 00:15:20.837
[GINKO] I was thinking
about leaving tomorrow

00:15:20.878 --> 00:15:22.505
if a boat's available.

00:15:22.547 --> 00:15:23.548
[ISANA]
Huh?

00:15:25.133 --> 00:15:27.093
If I get any more involved,

00:15:27.135 --> 00:15:31.347
I might begin to question if I
could ever leave this island.

00:15:31.389 --> 00:15:34.183
I don't have any right to
take away your happiness.

00:15:34.225 --> 00:15:36.227
Or anyone else's.

00:15:42.775 --> 00:15:44.318
Thanks, Ginko.

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.195
Thank you.

00:15:46.237 --> 00:15:47.780
When Mommy's about to die,

00:15:47.822 --> 00:15:50.158
I'm going to do the same
thing she did for me.

00:15:50.199 --> 00:15:52.285
I'm going to give
birth to her.

00:15:52.326 --> 00:15:55.037
So that way, we'll be
together forever.

00:15:55.079 --> 00:15:57.290
I couldn't live without Mommy.

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:03.463
[MIO'S FATHER]
We'd better wait and see

00:16:03.504 --> 00:16:05.381
what the weather's
going to do today.

00:16:05.423 --> 00:16:07.550
It could be a typhoon.

00:16:09.385 --> 00:16:16.934
I guess I don't have any choice.

00:16:16.976 --> 00:16:19.395
Sounds like the
storm's getting worse.

00:16:19.437 --> 00:16:20.521
It's loud.

00:16:20.563 --> 00:16:23.232
I sure hope it doesn't
keep you awake all night.

00:16:23.274 --> 00:16:24.484
Oh, don't worry.

00:16:24.525 --> 00:16:27.361
I know a good way
to fall asleep, Mommy.

00:16:27.403 --> 00:16:29.280
First, I close my eyes.

00:16:29.322 --> 00:16:31.824
Then, I imagine that I'm
a big fish in the ocean,

00:16:31.866 --> 00:16:35.244
swimming back and
forth very slowly.

00:16:35.286 --> 00:16:37.622
Then I start to go
deeper and deeper,

00:16:37.663 --> 00:16:39.999
and the water gets
bluer and bluer,

00:16:40.041 --> 00:16:42.460
and things start to
get darker and darker

00:16:42.502 --> 00:16:45.630
as I head towards the
bottom of the ocean.

00:16:45.671 --> 00:16:47.340
Then, before I know it--

00:16:49.217 --> 00:16:51.052
[ISANA]
Mommy?

00:16:51.093 --> 00:16:52.970
[MIO]
I'm sorry, Sweetie.

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:57.183
[MIO]
I'm fine. Just thirsty.

00:16:57.225 --> 00:17:00.102
Stay here. I'll be right back.

00:17:07.944 --> 00:17:11.489
Be strong... Be strong.

00:17:16.118 --> 00:17:18.412
[MIO]
It's going to get swept away.

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:29.340
[gasps]

00:17:29.382 --> 00:17:30.591
[MIO screams]

00:17:36.764 --> 00:17:40.476
[VILLAGERS shouting]

00:17:40.518 --> 00:17:43.187
My boat! It's missing!

00:17:43.229 --> 00:17:44.438
You don't--

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.357
Uh! Over there!

00:17:51.696 --> 00:17:53.864
[gasps]
Mio!

00:17:53.906 --> 00:17:55.950
[MIO'S FATHER]
Isana! No! Wait!

00:17:55.992 --> 00:17:57.493
Don't go near that glow!

00:17:57.535 --> 00:17:58.703
It'll eat you alive!

00:17:58.744 --> 00:17:59.412
[ISANA grunts]

00:17:59.453 --> 00:18:01.497
Don't be so hasty.

00:18:01.539 --> 00:18:02.999
We do this cautiously.

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.041
Right.

00:18:07.587 --> 00:18:09.422
[ISANA]
Mommy! Hold on!

00:18:09.463 --> 00:18:10.798
[MIO screams]

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:12.592
[GINKO]
They've surrounded the boat.

00:18:12.633 --> 00:18:14.594
What do we do?

00:18:14.635 --> 00:18:15.928
Isana!

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:16.846
[gasps]

00:18:16.887 --> 00:18:18.306
Stay away!

00:18:19.849 --> 00:18:21.058
[MIO]
Please!

00:18:22.435 --> 00:18:24.353
[GINKO]
No! Wait! Isana!

00:18:46.375 --> 00:18:46.959
[BOTH gasp]

00:18:46.959 --> 00:18:47.960
You alright?!

00:18:48.002 --> 00:18:49.629
[MIO coughs]

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:51.255
[GINKO]
Isana, what about you?!

00:18:51.297 --> 00:18:52.715
I'm okay.

00:18:54.425 --> 00:18:57.219
Get in! Hurry!

00:18:57.261 --> 00:18:58.471
[MIO shouts]

00:19:12.401 --> 00:19:15.696
[GINKO]
Damn, these things are strong.

00:19:15.738 --> 00:19:17.406
Can't budge.

00:19:17.448 --> 00:19:18.991
Not an inch.

00:19:20.117 --> 00:19:21.952
[GINKO]
If they eat me,

00:19:21.994 --> 00:19:25.122
will they turn me
into an embryo, too?

00:19:25.164 --> 00:19:28.751
I'd have to start
life all over again.

00:19:28.793 --> 00:19:31.045
A new beginning.

00:19:31.087 --> 00:19:32.713
Now there's a thought.

00:19:34.382 --> 00:19:36.634
[GINKO]
Some would kill for that.

00:19:38.427 --> 00:19:40.429
[GINKO]
But me?

00:19:40.471 --> 00:19:42.556
Not a chance.

00:19:42.598 --> 00:19:45.101
Instead it'd be more like...

00:19:45.142 --> 00:19:47.520
...like a bad joke.

00:19:53.567 --> 00:19:54.819
[GINKO]
What?

00:19:58.989 --> 00:20:00.908
[GINKO]
They're letting go?

00:20:09.333 --> 00:20:11.627
[ALL gasp]

00:20:11.669 --> 00:20:13.671
[MIO]
We need to get out of the water.

00:20:15.256 --> 00:20:18.718
[GINKO]
The storm... it's passed.

00:20:20.845 --> 00:20:25.307
[GINKO] Why? Why did the
<i>mushi</i> let go so suddenly?

00:20:34.859 --> 00:20:37.027
[GINKO]
So that's it.

00:20:37.069 --> 00:20:39.071
The moon.

00:20:39.113 --> 00:20:41.115
The moon is out.

00:20:48.664 --> 00:20:49.957
[GINKO]
I'll admit I don't know much

00:20:49.999 --> 00:20:51.792
about these particular <i>mushi,</i>

00:20:51.834 --> 00:20:53.711
but I'll share my
theory with you.

00:20:53.753 --> 00:20:55.171
That weird glow?

00:20:55.212 --> 00:20:57.423
That's how they
lure people in.

00:20:57.465 --> 00:21:01.135
They eat them and regenerate
those people as embryos.

00:21:01.177 --> 00:21:03.721
That's just their nature.

00:21:03.763 --> 00:21:06.182
These <i>mushi</i> have
a particular diet.

00:21:06.223 --> 00:21:09.935
They feed on the length
of time a person lives.

00:21:09.977 --> 00:21:12.062
Anyway, I'm sure both of you

00:21:12.104 --> 00:21:14.732
had figured this out
already on your own.

00:21:14.774 --> 00:21:16.942
And as for your other issues,

00:21:16.984 --> 00:21:18.319
give it time.

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.362
I'm sure you'll work them out.

00:21:21.655 --> 00:21:22.656
Right.

00:21:22.698 --> 00:21:24.033
As for you...

00:21:24.074 --> 00:21:27.161
You jumped right into that
water without a second thought.

00:21:27.203 --> 00:21:29.789
Thanks for scaring the
daylights out of me.

00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:32.374
[giggles]
I'm sorry.

00:21:32.416 --> 00:21:33.375
That was dangerous.

00:21:33.417 --> 00:21:35.419
Even if they ate your mother,

00:21:35.461 --> 00:21:39.715
You would've seen her again
when she was reborn, you know?

00:21:39.757 --> 00:21:42.510
[ISANA] Yes, but they would
have eaten up all the time

00:21:42.551 --> 00:21:44.345
Mommy had lived, wouldn't they?

00:21:44.386 --> 00:21:46.972
I couldn't let that
happen to her.

00:21:47.014 --> 00:21:49.433
I'd be so lonely.

00:21:49.475 --> 00:21:52.853
But even so, I think I'd
rather see Mommy die...

00:21:52.895 --> 00:21:57.650
...than give her entire
lifetime away to someone else.

00:21:58.901 --> 00:22:01.487
[ISANA]
Uh...

00:22:01.529 --> 00:22:03.781
[MIO]
You think just like I do.

00:22:05.574 --> 00:22:08.410
[MIO] And that's just
what I'd expect...

00:22:08.452 --> 00:22:10.871
...from my daughter.

00:22:18.546 --> 00:22:20.548
[GINKO]
<i>Uminaoshi.</i>

00:22:20.589 --> 00:22:22.758
They'll continue to occur
here on the island

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:26.345
as long as people
choose rebirth over death.

00:22:26.387 --> 00:22:31.392
After all, they help
put the dying at ease.

00:22:31.433 --> 00:22:32.601
They fill the void

00:22:32.643 --> 00:22:36.814
in the hearts of their loved
ones who are left behind.

00:22:36.856 --> 00:22:40.276
But perhaps being able to
die without that hope,

00:22:40.317 --> 00:22:41.861
at least here,

00:22:41.902 --> 00:22:45.322
is one of life's rare and
fortunate blessings.

00:23:48.427 --> 00:23:51.597
