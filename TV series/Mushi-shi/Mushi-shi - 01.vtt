it was somehow wrong

to create new forms of life

in a town or village,

most people's understanding.

your grandmother

looking out for me.

[SHINRA]
Mm-hm.

00:06:51.995 --> 00:06:53.872
Sometimes, when I'm by myself,

00:06:53.914 --> 00:06:56.583
these creatures suddenly
appear out of nowhere.

so she could see them, too.

upset her for some reason.

They're not real.

You poor, poor child.

00:07:26.571 --> 00:07:28.865
[SHINRA] That's all she
would ever say about it.

00:07:28.907 --> 00:07:30.575
And until the day she died,

00:07:30.617 --> 00:07:33.828
she never really believed
I saw the things I saw.

00:07:35.205 --> 00:07:36.289
[SHINRA]
It got to the point that

00:07:36.331 --> 00:07:41.252
I even started doubting myself,
thinking maybe she was right.

00:07:41.294 --> 00:07:43.797
Maybe it was all
in my mind somehow.

No matter how hard I tried...

00:07:47.717 --> 00:07:50.220
...I just couldn't seem
to make her understand.

00:07:52.305 --> 00:07:54.432
That's because...

00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:56.685
...these creatures
are all <i>"mushi."</i>

That's right.

I suppose there's
really no simple way

to explain what they are,

but let me try giving
you an analogy.

00:08:05.026 --> 00:08:07.487
Say these four fingers
represent animal life,

00:08:07.529 --> 00:08:09.739
and your thumb
represents plant life.

00:08:09.781 --> 00:08:12.701
Human beings would be here, at
the tip of your middle finger,

00:08:12.742 --> 00:08:15.495
the farthest point
from your heart.

00:08:15.537 --> 00:08:17.372
Moving toward the
palm of your hand,

00:08:17.414 --> 00:08:20.083
you find the lower
forms of animal life.

00:08:20.125 --> 00:08:21.751
When you get to
your wrist though,

00:08:21.793 --> 00:08:24.796
that's where your blood vessels
combine into one, right?

00:08:24.838 --> 00:08:25.714
[SHINRA]
Right.

00:08:25.755 --> 00:08:28.717
[GINKO] This is where you would
find fungi and microorganisms.

00:08:28.758 --> 00:08:30.885
From here, it becomes
more and more difficult

00:08:30.927 --> 00:08:34.305
to distinguish between
plant and animal life.

00:08:34.347 --> 00:08:37.767
Even so, there is still
life beyond this point.

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:39.310
And if you keep going...

00:08:39.352 --> 00:08:41.521
...all the way up your arm...

00:08:41.563 --> 00:08:43.648
...past your shoulder...

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:45.650
...when you get to this point...

00:08:45.692 --> 00:08:48.945
...at the place that's closest
to your heart, right here.

00:08:48.987 --> 00:08:51.573
These creatures...
are the <i>mushi.</i>

00:08:52.657 --> 00:08:55.160
[GINKO] They are life
in its purest form.

00:08:57.579 --> 00:08:59.080
[GINKO]
Because of their nature,

00:08:59.122 --> 00:09:02.459
their shapes and physical
appearances are ambiguous.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:05.795
Some you can see;
some you can't.

00:09:05.837 --> 00:09:07.589
Yeah, some were transparent.

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:09.257
Sort of like a ghost.

00:09:09.299 --> 00:09:11.301
Many of the things that
people call "ghosts"

00:09:11.342 --> 00:09:13.428
are actually <i>mushi</i>
of some sort.

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:17.057
Some can even take
on human form.

00:09:17.098 --> 00:09:18.433
I'm guessing your grandmother

00:09:18.475 --> 00:09:20.935
was simply unable
to see the <i>mushi.</i>

00:09:20.977 --> 00:09:22.937
It's not surprising she
didn't believe you.

00:09:22.979 --> 00:09:26.566
It's not easy to communicate
a sensory experience.

00:09:26.608 --> 00:09:27.901
Just as it would be difficult to

00:09:27.942 --> 00:09:30.612
completely describe the feel
and texture of an object

00:09:30.653 --> 00:09:33.406
to someone who's never
held it in his own hands.

00:09:34.991 --> 00:09:36.367
[GINKO]
Try though you might,

00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:39.537
unless your grandmother could
see it with her own eyes,

00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:40.663
it would be almost impossible

00:09:40.705 --> 00:09:43.958
to make her understand
the <i>mushi</i> world.

00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:44.959
[SHINRA]
I'm sorry, Grandma.

00:09:46.044 --> 00:09:48.171
I didn't know.

00:09:48.213 --> 00:09:50.590
But you have no idea
how happy it makes me

00:09:50.632 --> 00:09:53.843
to learn that these strange
creatures really do exist.

00:09:58.848 --> 00:10:01.976
[snoring]

00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:04.604
[footsteps]

00:10:07.398 --> 00:10:10.985
[GINKO] Now... where was
that bathroom again?

00:10:11.027 --> 00:10:13.571
This place is a maze.
It's so big.

00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:16.282
I don't see how Shinra
lives here all alone.

00:10:19.202 --> 00:10:22.831
[GINKO]
Then again, maybe he doesn't...

00:10:22.872 --> 00:10:27.252
An old house like this, it's
no surprise to find <i>mushi</i> here.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:35.510
[GINKO]
Where'd it go?

00:10:35.552 --> 00:10:38.638
[RENZU]
Oh... A <i>mushi</i> pin...

00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:41.641
[RENZU]
Hoping to find a new specimen

00:10:41.683 --> 00:10:44.811
to add to your collection,
is that it?

00:10:44.853 --> 00:10:48.064
You don't scare me,
<i>Mushi</i> Master.

00:10:48.106 --> 00:10:49.816
[chuckles] Well...

00:10:53.403 --> 00:10:55.363
You're a cheeky one, aren't you.

00:10:55.405 --> 00:10:56.281
[RENZU gasps]

00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:57.740
[whimpers]

00:10:57.782 --> 00:11:01.161
Wha--? What's happening?
What is this?!

00:11:01.202 --> 00:11:02.287
It's <i>mushi.</i>

00:11:02.328 --> 00:11:03.663
Same as you.

00:11:03.705 --> 00:11:05.623
With one difference...

00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:07.709
This one likes to
stick to other <i>mushi.</i>

00:11:08.751 --> 00:11:10.336
[GINKO]
It'll fade in a second.

00:11:14.299 --> 00:11:15.758
[gasps]

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.552
[GINKO]
Say...

00:11:17.594 --> 00:11:20.513
What do we have here?
A broken wine cup?

00:11:20.555 --> 00:11:21.598
It's a shame.

00:11:21.639 --> 00:11:22.515
I really like the color--

00:11:22.557 --> 00:11:23.600
[RENZU]
Shut up.

00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:24.893
Give it back.

00:11:24.934 --> 00:11:27.520
How dare you barge into
my house like this?

00:11:27.562 --> 00:11:28.605
Go away.

00:11:28.646 --> 00:11:29.480
Get out!

00:11:29.522 --> 00:11:31.900
[GINKO] That's big talk
coming from a <i>mushi.</i>

00:11:31.941 --> 00:11:33.693
What are you saying?
This is your house?

00:11:33.735 --> 00:11:36.487
[RENZU]
Yes, that's right.

00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:37.488
[GINKO]
Ah...

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:38.907
I see...

00:11:38.948 --> 00:11:41.701
I think I'm beginning
to understand.

00:11:41.743 --> 00:11:42.744
You were a human once,

00:11:42.785 --> 00:11:46.456
but somehow you came to
acquire <i>mushi</i> characteristics.

00:11:46.497 --> 00:11:47.790
You're rather weak, though,

00:11:47.832 --> 00:11:50.126
which suggests you're
not a full <i>mushi.</i>

00:11:50.168 --> 00:11:52.378
And along with the
broken green wine cup,

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:55.298
gives me some idea of how
you ended up like this.

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.926
It also tells me who you are.

00:11:57.967 --> 00:11:59.969
Your name...

00:12:00.011 --> 00:12:00.762
...is Renzu.

00:12:00.803 --> 00:12:02.180
[gasps]

00:12:02.222 --> 00:12:03.598
You didn't think
I'd come all this way

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:05.808
without doing my
homework, did you?

00:12:07.352 --> 00:12:08.436
I think I know a way

00:12:08.478 --> 00:12:10.980
that we can make this
wine cup whole again.

00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:14.359
[GINKO]
Care to hear me out?

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.152
For your grandson's sake?

00:12:20.573 --> 00:12:21.574
What are you saying?

00:12:21.616 --> 00:12:24.327
Grandma's still here
in this house?

00:12:24.369 --> 00:12:25.870
[GINKO]
Yes, that's right.

00:12:25.912 --> 00:12:28.081
Though, not in human form.

00:12:28.122 --> 00:12:29.874
Right now she's stuck in limbo,

00:12:29.916 --> 00:12:33.378
between the human
and <i>mushi</i> worlds...

00:12:33.419 --> 00:12:34.420
[SHINRA]
I--

00:12:34.462 --> 00:12:36.214
I don't understand.

00:12:37.465 --> 00:12:40.677
There's a phenomenon
called a <i>"Mushi</i> Banquet."

00:12:40.718 --> 00:12:43.012
The <i>mushi</i> appear in human form,

00:12:43.054 --> 00:12:46.015
and invite a chosen guest
to sit among them.

00:12:46.057 --> 00:12:48.685
The guest is then
presented with a wine cup.

00:12:48.726 --> 00:12:51.646
For those who accept the cup,
as they drink from it,

00:12:51.688 --> 00:12:55.400
the physical boundaries of their
human body begin to fade.

00:12:55.441 --> 00:12:59.862
In other words, they begin to
cross over into the <i>mushi</i> world.

00:13:01.197 --> 00:13:04.033
So that's what happened...
to Grandma...?

00:13:04.075 --> 00:13:04.993
That's right.

00:13:05.034 --> 00:13:08.538
Except for some reason,
her banquet was interrupted.

00:13:08.579 --> 00:13:10.581
Thus, your grandmother
was unable to complete

00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:12.625
her <i>mushi</i> transformation.

00:13:12.667 --> 00:13:14.585
That's not to say
she wasn't changed.

00:13:14.627 --> 00:13:18.423
She was still a different person
when she returned to this house.

00:13:18.464 --> 00:13:21.718
Half of herself had
been left behind.

00:13:21.759 --> 00:13:24.679
But know this:
even though the grandmother

00:13:24.721 --> 00:13:28.266
you knew and loved was only
half of her former self,

00:13:28.308 --> 00:13:31.811
the other half was here,
too, in this house,

00:13:31.853 --> 00:13:36.441
watching over you every day,
from the day you were born.

00:13:39.068 --> 00:13:42.655
I... I'm sorry. I had no idea.

00:13:42.697 --> 00:13:43.948
[GINKO]
I know.

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:47.035
You weren't able to see her
because she's not a full <i>mushi.</i>

00:13:47.076 --> 00:13:49.329
But you can still help her.

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:50.788
I believe you can
use your powers

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:53.916
to complete her
<i>mushi</i> transformation.

00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.501
If you do this, though,

00:13:55.543 --> 00:13:59.255
she will never be able to
return to the human world.

00:13:59.297 --> 00:14:00.840
It's your choice.

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.052
Is that true...?

00:14:05.553 --> 00:14:08.014
So if we do as
you say, then I'll--

00:14:09.223 --> 00:14:12.143
I'll really be able
to see Shinra again?

00:14:14.771 --> 00:14:18.232
[GINKO] Your grandmother
didn't need long to decide.

00:14:18.274 --> 00:14:20.068
Shinra...

00:14:20.109 --> 00:14:21.736
You will help her...

00:14:21.778 --> 00:14:22.987
...won't you?

00:14:29.952 --> 00:14:31.579
[SHINRA] Don't watch
me while I'm drawing.

00:14:31.621 --> 00:14:33.456
[GINKO]
I know, I know...

00:14:33.498 --> 00:14:35.083
Now, whenever you're ready...

00:14:35.124 --> 00:14:37.085
With your left hand,
try drawing the wine cup

00:14:37.126 --> 00:14:39.420
that your grandmother received
at the <i>Mushi</i> Banquet--

00:14:39.462 --> 00:14:41.255
The one that I told you about.

00:14:41.297 --> 00:14:43.091
Okay, but... you never told me

00:14:43.132 --> 00:14:45.134
what it looks like,
the color or the shape.

00:14:45.176 --> 00:14:46.928
It's okay, don't
worry about that.

00:14:46.969 --> 00:14:49.222
Just use your imagination.

00:14:49.263 --> 00:14:50.890
[SHINRA]
My imagination?

00:14:50.932 --> 00:14:52.058
[GINKO]
Trust me.

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:54.310
The half of the wine cup
your grandmother kept

00:14:54.352 --> 00:14:56.020
should have been passed
down figuratively

00:14:56.062 --> 00:14:57.397
through the generations,

00:14:57.438 --> 00:15:00.733
first to her child and
then to her grandchild.

00:15:00.775 --> 00:15:02.402
[GINKO]
Since he told me not to...

00:15:02.443 --> 00:15:04.278
...I just have to look.

00:15:11.828 --> 00:15:15.289
I get-- I get the
feeling that it's green.

00:15:15.331 --> 00:15:17.458
Like the forest...

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:18.918
A deep green...

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.711
Lush and vibrant...

00:15:23.131 --> 00:15:25.842
And it's-- it's flat...

00:15:25.883 --> 00:15:27.135
...and round in shape.

00:15:27.176 --> 00:15:28.428
[GINKO]
That's it!

00:15:33.641 --> 00:15:35.476
--[GINKO] Oh, wow...
--[SHINRA gasps]

00:15:35.518 --> 00:15:36.727
[SHINRA]
It's cracking.

00:15:40.857 --> 00:15:41.941
Renzu!

00:15:46.529 --> 00:15:48.781
[SHINRA]
Is that you, Grandma?

00:15:48.823 --> 00:15:50.324
Are you there?

00:15:50.366 --> 00:15:51.576
[GINKO]
Now then...

00:16:00.918 --> 00:16:03.421
Oh! What is that...?

00:16:03.463 --> 00:16:04.672
Your turn, Renzu.

00:16:04.714 --> 00:16:05.798
Drink this.

00:16:29.238 --> 00:16:30.865
Uh-- Grandma...?

00:16:32.158 --> 00:16:33.826
[chuckles]

00:16:33.868 --> 00:16:35.828
Come on, no need to be shy.

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:36.621
Oh, sorry.

00:16:36.662 --> 00:16:39.123
I just wasn't expecting
her to be so young is all.

00:16:39.165 --> 00:16:41.125
And here. You should
have a sip, too.

00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:42.168
Y'know, to celebrate.

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:43.211
[SHINRA]
Sure.

00:16:45.922 --> 00:16:47.131
[SHINRA gasps]

00:16:48.132 --> 00:16:49.926
[SHINRA]
Are these...

00:16:49.967 --> 00:16:52.178
...Grandma's memories?

00:16:54.555 --> 00:16:55.598
I need to hurry.

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:57.517
The sun is starting to set.

00:17:01.395 --> 00:17:02.647
[RENZU]
<i>Mushi...?</i>

00:17:25.586 --> 00:17:27.547
[RENZU]
I can't get out of line...

00:17:53.155 --> 00:17:54.282
[HUMANOID]
Please...

00:17:54.323 --> 00:17:55.324
...drink...

00:17:55.366 --> 00:17:56.993
...Renzu Yoroi.

00:17:58.995 --> 00:18:01.872
[HUMANOID] This is a banquet
held in your honor.

00:18:03.165 --> 00:18:04.792
[RENZU]
It's so fragrant.

00:18:11.674 --> 00:18:14.552
[RENZU] I've never
tasted anything like it.

00:18:14.594 --> 00:18:17.513
I could lose myself
in this forever...

00:18:17.555 --> 00:18:19.849
[HUMANOID]
Are you enjoying your drink?

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:23.894
What you are tasting is a living
entity known as "Light Wine."

00:18:23.936 --> 00:18:27.273
It springs from a place that,
normally, you could not reach--

00:18:27.315 --> 00:18:28.816
a river of light that flows

00:18:28.858 --> 00:18:31.569
in the depths of the
deepest darkness.

00:18:31.611 --> 00:18:34.614
We have created especially
for you this wine cup,

00:18:34.655 --> 00:18:36.574
which can extract the light.

00:18:36.616 --> 00:18:38.701
The river flows all around you,

00:18:38.743 --> 00:18:41.245
as it has since
life first began.

00:18:41.287 --> 00:18:45.708
When it nears the soil, grasses
grow green and forests blossom.

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:49.837
If it recedes, the landscape
withers in drought.

00:18:49.879 --> 00:18:53.007
In other words, it is
the water of life.

00:18:53.049 --> 00:18:56.344
You will not taste anything
more delicious in this world.

00:18:56.385 --> 00:18:58.721
The reason we have set
this banquet for you

00:18:58.763 --> 00:19:00.723
and shared with you this drink,

00:19:00.765 --> 00:19:03.851
is that we have a
favor to ask of you.

00:19:03.893 --> 00:19:05.561
Thirty-one years from now,

00:19:05.603 --> 00:19:09.565
your grandson will be born
with a very special gift--

00:19:09.607 --> 00:19:14.111
a power with the potential to
change the world as you know it.

00:19:14.153 --> 00:19:16.364
We would like you
to watch over him,

00:19:16.405 --> 00:19:18.991
for the entirety of his life.

00:19:19.033 --> 00:19:21.535
[RENZU]
My... My grandson?

00:19:21.577 --> 00:19:23.954
[HUMANOID] His powers will
be a source of great happiness

00:19:23.996 --> 00:19:26.666
for both him and the world...

00:19:26.707 --> 00:19:29.669
If you agree to the task
we have set before you,

00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:32.588
we will grant you
powers of your own.

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:36.676
Drink the wine to the last
drop, and it will be so.

00:19:43.474 --> 00:19:44.517
[crow squawks]

00:20:00.866 --> 00:20:02.326
[RENZU]
It's empty...

00:20:08.082 --> 00:20:09.875
I should be getting home.

00:20:09.917 --> 00:20:10.835
[cup shatters]

00:20:10.876 --> 00:20:11.877
[SHINRA gasps]

00:20:33.899 --> 00:20:35.609
[RENZU]
Shinra...?

00:20:35.651 --> 00:20:36.652
I'm sorry...

00:20:36.694 --> 00:20:39.321
I'm crying, but I
have no idea why.

00:20:41.282 --> 00:20:43.868
[GINKO]
Shinra's tears would not stop...

00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:45.911
He could feel all
of Renzu's emotions

00:20:45.953 --> 00:20:48.372
as her memories
flowed through him.

00:20:48.414 --> 00:20:52.376
He experienced that day in
the forest, just as she had.

00:20:52.418 --> 00:20:55.296
And finally, he understood.

00:20:55.337 --> 00:20:57.757
The overwhelming sadness...

00:20:57.798 --> 00:21:01.635
The profound sense of loss
over the broken cup...

00:21:01.677 --> 00:21:05.639
And as Shinra's tears flowed,
so did the Light Wine.

00:21:05.681 --> 00:21:09.143
It flowed from the cup,
endlessly...

00:21:09.185 --> 00:21:12.271
...like the river
from which it came...

00:21:13.856 --> 00:21:16.400
[snoring]

00:21:17.693 --> 00:21:19.278
[RENZU]
Leaving already?

00:21:22.948 --> 00:21:24.033
[GINKO]
That's new.

00:21:24.074 --> 00:21:26.118
This place is covered in moss.

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:28.412
[RENZU] Yes, this is where
the Light Wine spilled

00:21:28.454 --> 00:21:30.122
onto the ground last night.

00:21:31.582 --> 00:21:34.376
So, have you given up
on studying Shinra, then?

00:21:34.418 --> 00:21:35.961
For now, I guess.

00:21:36.003 --> 00:21:39.924
I hear his grandmother doesn't
like strangers nosing around.

00:21:39.965 --> 00:21:41.050
[chuckles]

00:21:41.091 --> 00:21:42.760
Well, if you're ever
traveling this way,

00:21:42.802 --> 00:21:45.304
I do hope you'll stop by.

00:21:45.346 --> 00:21:47.139
I know it can't
be helped, but...

00:21:47.181 --> 00:21:49.683
Shinra does get lonely
here by himself.

00:21:51.227 --> 00:21:54.647
No. I don't think he'll
have that problem anymore.

00:21:54.688 --> 00:21:58.484
At least, not as long as he
has you here by his side.

00:22:02.321 --> 00:22:04.990
[SHINRA groans]
Huh? Where's Ginko?

00:22:05.032 --> 00:22:06.075
He's already gone.

00:22:06.116 --> 00:22:08.953
What? But he didn't
even tell me goodbye.

00:22:08.994 --> 00:22:09.787
It's too bad,

00:22:09.829 --> 00:22:12.122
we didn't get a chance
to thank him properly.

00:22:16.085 --> 00:22:17.461
[SHINRA]
Maybe not...

00:22:17.503 --> 00:22:18.712
But...

00:22:18.754 --> 00:22:21.131
The green wine cup is missing.

00:22:26.554 --> 00:22:28.347
[GINKO]
From that day on,

00:22:28.389 --> 00:22:31.559
the rumors of the boy with
the god-like left hand

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:34.395
were heard less and less...

00:22:34.436 --> 00:22:38.357
Until finally, they
simply faded away.

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:51.639
