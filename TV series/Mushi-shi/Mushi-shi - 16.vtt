00:10:58.449 --> 00:11:00.160
[sighs]

00:11:00.201 --> 00:11:02.036
It's getting pretty late,
but it still doesn't look

00:11:02.078 --> 00:11:04.372
like she's going
to get any sleep.

00:11:05.623 --> 00:11:09.169
She says she can't sleep.
Not even if she tries to.

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:12.130
That's why she can
stay up all night weaving.

00:11:12.172 --> 00:11:14.674
While she's working,
she also uses the time

00:11:14.716 --> 00:11:17.218
to think about Dad
over and over

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.179
so she won't forget him.

00:11:21.347 --> 00:11:23.141
[GINKO]
I see.

00:11:23.183 --> 00:11:25.685
If she could
at least get some sleep,

00:11:25.727 --> 00:11:28.605
it would be easier
for her to wait for him.

00:11:29.981 --> 00:11:31.983
[loom clacks]

00:11:33.067 --> 00:11:35.486
[GINKO]
The warm breeze.

00:11:35.528 --> 00:11:39.240
The fragrance of the flowers.

00:11:39.282 --> 00:11:41.534
The sound of the loom.

00:11:41.576 --> 00:11:44.329
[loom clacks]

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:49.083
[GINKO] If this is how
all of her nights are...

00:11:49.125 --> 00:11:51.252
...I can't think of any
reason that she wouldn't

00:11:51.294 --> 00:11:55.173
be drawn into
a deep, deep sleep.

00:12:05.433 --> 00:12:09.896
[GINKO] Mm. Looks like she's
finally starting to nod off.

00:12:15.985 --> 00:12:18.071
[GINKO]
She's already waking up?

00:12:18.112 --> 00:12:20.698
Oh! Morning already?

00:12:22.533 --> 00:12:24.244
[gasps]

00:12:24.285 --> 00:12:26.329
[SAYO]
Time to make breakfast.

00:12:27.747 --> 00:12:30.959
Mm? What's the matter?

00:12:42.178 --> 00:12:45.640
[GINKO] So that's it.
Just as I suspected.

00:12:48.351 --> 00:12:50.895
A <i>mushi</i> that eats memories?

00:12:50.937 --> 00:12:54.774
Yes. It's known
as a Kagedama.

00:12:54.816 --> 00:12:56.693
It's dark, and translucent,

00:12:56.734 --> 00:12:58.945
and it has
a membrane-like form.

00:12:58.987 --> 00:13:02.865
It likes to hide out in the
shadows of large, old trees...

00:13:02.907 --> 00:13:05.743
There, it waits for animals
and people to rest.

00:13:05.785 --> 00:13:08.037
While they sleep,
the <i>mushi</i> enters the ear

00:13:08.079 --> 00:13:09.998
and makes it's way to the brain.

00:13:10.039 --> 00:13:12.583
After that,
the host rarely sleeps,

00:13:12.625 --> 00:13:16.879
and little by little, they
gradually lose their memories.

00:13:18.881 --> 00:13:21.134
[SAYO] It lives in the shadow
of that cherry blossom

00:13:21.175 --> 00:13:22.677
in the garden?

00:13:22.719 --> 00:13:25.138
[GINKO]
Yes. Most likely.

00:13:25.179 --> 00:13:27.056
Once it consumes
enough memories,

00:13:27.098 --> 00:13:29.350
the <i>mushi</i> divides itself.

00:13:29.392 --> 00:13:31.644
The new half is then
sent out of the host's body

00:13:31.686 --> 00:13:33.187
during a brief moment of sleep

00:13:33.229 --> 00:13:35.648
to hide in the shadows
of nearby trees.

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:38.651
That's how they reproduce.

00:13:38.693 --> 00:13:40.862
By nature,
they're weak and fragile,

00:13:40.903 --> 00:13:44.282
and can vanish if they remain
in the sunlight for too long.

00:13:44.324 --> 00:13:46.617
I'm sorry. But since
this <i>mushi</i> has already

00:13:46.659 --> 00:13:52.290
imbedded itself into your brain,
there's nothing we can do.

00:13:52.332 --> 00:13:55.084
Wait! You mean
there's no cure?!

00:13:55.126 --> 00:13:57.545
The only known weakness
of the Kagedama is sunlight,

00:13:57.587 --> 00:13:59.881
so we've got nothing.

00:13:59.922 --> 00:14:02.675
There's no way to shine
sunlight in your brain.

00:14:04.594 --> 00:14:06.971
[GINKO] But it might still be
possible to protect the memories

00:14:07.013 --> 00:14:08.973
you don't want to forget.

00:14:09.015 --> 00:14:11.309
Huh?

00:14:11.351 --> 00:14:14.354
As an example, let's say
memories are stored

00:14:14.395 --> 00:14:19.108
in the same way that drawers
hold things inside a closet.

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:20.693
Your memories of Dangos,

00:14:20.735 --> 00:14:24.155
relatives that live
far away, sneezes...

00:14:24.197 --> 00:14:26.240
They are all
categorized and filed

00:14:26.282 --> 00:14:28.409
into countless
different drawers.

00:14:28.451 --> 00:14:31.204
The Kagedama takes
the whole drawer out,

00:14:31.245 --> 00:14:33.414
one drawer at a time.

00:14:33.456 --> 00:14:35.124
The order it chooses
doesn't seem to have

00:14:35.166 --> 00:14:37.168
anything to do
with your interests.

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:39.837
It appears to be
completely random.

00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:42.632
But... there's still hope.

00:14:42.673 --> 00:14:47.053
There's a set of memories the
Kagedama hasn't touched yet.

00:14:47.095 --> 00:14:49.972
The things that you do
repeatedly every day.

00:14:50.014 --> 00:14:53.810
The things
that you see and think.

00:14:53.851 --> 00:14:57.772
Like how to cook,
how to weave on the loom,

00:14:57.814 --> 00:15:00.191
the memories of your son,

00:15:00.233 --> 00:15:04.445
the husband that you
set a place for everyday.

00:15:04.487 --> 00:15:06.239
The <i>mushi</i> probably
leaves the memories

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:09.700
pertaining to the basics
of daily living until last

00:15:09.742 --> 00:15:13.871
to prolong the host's life
as much as possible.

00:15:13.913 --> 00:15:17.708
So... you're saying
I won't forget those things?

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:21.337
It's just a theory.
I don't know for sure.

00:15:21.379 --> 00:15:23.047
It could be that later on,

00:15:23.089 --> 00:15:25.675
if your supply of memories
starts to deplete,

00:15:25.716 --> 00:15:29.679
the <i>mushi</i> might begin to prey
on those vital ones, as well.

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:33.808
So, with that in mind,
my suggestion would be this:

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:36.269
Store up as many
memories as possible,

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:39.313
and continue to think about the
ones you don't want to forget

00:15:39.355 --> 00:15:41.774
over and over again.

00:15:44.485 --> 00:15:47.697
I understand.
I'll try my best.

00:15:47.738 --> 00:15:49.157
You can do it, Mom.

00:15:49.198 --> 00:15:51.367
And instead of
always staying home,

00:15:51.409 --> 00:15:53.953
you should go out sometimes.

00:15:53.995 --> 00:15:57.790
You're right.
Maybe I'll do just that.

00:15:57.832 --> 00:15:59.500
Instead of waiting here
for your father,

00:15:59.542 --> 00:16:01.502
maybe I should
go out and find him.

00:16:01.544 --> 00:16:02.712
Huh?

00:16:02.753 --> 00:16:04.755
[SAYO]
Stop making that silly face.

00:16:04.797 --> 00:16:06.174
Come on.

00:16:06.215 --> 00:16:09.510
I've thought about
doing this for a while now.

00:16:09.552 --> 00:16:12.138
I'm just scared. Scared to
find out what happened

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:14.891
to keep him away
from home for so long.

00:16:14.932 --> 00:16:18.311
But not anymore.
I'm tired of waiting.

00:16:18.352 --> 00:16:19.937
You think you can find him?

00:16:19.979 --> 00:16:24.066
I do. Your father often
spoke of a city in the west.

00:16:24.108 --> 00:16:27.069
It's at least a good place
to start looking.

00:16:27.111 --> 00:16:29.113
[GINKO]
Is she going to be all right?

00:16:29.155 --> 00:16:33.075
And you'll come along
and help me, right? Kaji?

00:16:37.997 --> 00:16:39.248
[KAJI]
This is it.

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:40.708
[GINKO]
Right.

00:16:45.129 --> 00:16:47.256
Thanks for everything.

00:16:47.298 --> 00:16:49.342
No, thank you.

00:16:49.383 --> 00:16:51.552
Be careful, okay?!

00:16:51.594 --> 00:16:54.138
[SAYO]
You too! Take care!

00:16:55.348 --> 00:16:57.850
[GINKO] Even as I was leaving,
I didn't know for sure

00:16:57.892 --> 00:17:00.561
if that decision was
what was best for them.

00:17:03.898 --> 00:17:05.358
[GINKO]
I found out what happened

00:17:05.399 --> 00:17:07.985
a little more
than a year later.

00:17:13.574 --> 00:17:16.327
[GINKO]
Ah! I see you've returned!

00:17:17.495 --> 00:17:19.163
[KAJI]
Ginko!

00:17:19.205 --> 00:17:22.542
Good afternoon! Welcome!
What would you like?

00:17:22.583 --> 00:17:24.669
[MALE CUSTOMER]
Hmm. Let me see...

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:28.047
Your mother seems well.
I was wondering about her.

00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:29.507
[KAJI]
Yep.

00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:32.552
[GINKO]
Did you find your father?

00:17:32.593 --> 00:17:37.014
[KAJI] Yeah. He was
in that city to the west.

00:17:37.056 --> 00:17:39.767
And he was living there
with a different family.

00:17:39.809 --> 00:17:41.686
[indistinctive chatter]

00:17:41.727 --> 00:17:43.354
[MERCHANT]
Sure! I know him!

00:17:43.396 --> 00:17:45.648
He lives just down
the road. That way.

00:17:49.735 --> 00:17:53.447
[BABY fussing]

00:17:53.489 --> 00:17:55.533
[FATHER]
There we go!

00:17:55.575 --> 00:17:58.536
[BABY giggles]
[FATHER, MOTHER laugh]

00:17:58.578 --> 00:18:00.705
[MOTHER]
You like that?

00:18:04.208 --> 00:18:07.837
Mom! Why didn't you
at least say something?!

00:18:09.046 --> 00:18:11.215
Mom! Why?

00:18:14.719 --> 00:18:17.638
[KAJI] On the way back,
Mom walked silently

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:19.724
never saying a word.

00:18:19.765 --> 00:18:24.020
She just kept moving,
never stopping to eat or sleep.

00:18:24.061 --> 00:18:25.146
Until finally...

00:18:25.187 --> 00:18:27.481
[KAJI]
Mom. You need to...

00:18:29.525 --> 00:18:31.861
Mom. Mom!

00:18:41.245 --> 00:18:45.082
[KAJI] She collapsed
from exhaustion.

00:18:45.124 --> 00:18:47.543
After that,
she remained asleep

00:18:47.585 --> 00:18:49.837
for the next several days.

00:19:11.108 --> 00:19:13.152
Morning already?

00:19:36.384 --> 00:19:40.137
[KAJI] Something was here.
It just left.

00:19:43.015 --> 00:19:45.768
Mom, are you okay?!

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:49.188
Well, of course I am.
Why? What's wrong?

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:57.154
[SAYO]
Mmm-mmm!

00:19:57.196 --> 00:19:59.323
I slept like a log!

00:19:59.365 --> 00:20:02.284
Looks like it's time
to start making breakfast.

00:20:04.578 --> 00:20:06.330
Where are we?

00:20:06.372 --> 00:20:08.332
What did you say?

00:20:08.374 --> 00:20:10.167
Why are we here?

00:20:10.209 --> 00:20:13.504
What are we doing
in this place, Kaji?

00:20:16.465 --> 00:20:19.176
We're on our way back
from vacation.

00:20:19.218 --> 00:20:20.594
[SAYO]
We are?

00:20:20.636 --> 00:20:22.972
[SAYO'S stomach grumbles]

00:20:23.013 --> 00:20:26.392
What was that?
What was that sound?

00:20:26.434 --> 00:20:29.812
[KAJI] It's nothing.
Why don't we eat something?

00:20:29.854 --> 00:20:33.566
[SAYO] Yeah! Good idea!
I'm starving.

00:20:37.945 --> 00:20:42.742
[KAJI]
Yeah. Yeah, me too.

00:20:42.783 --> 00:20:47.997
Hey Mom, after we eat,
let's go home.

00:20:49.248 --> 00:20:51.125
[KAJI] That morning
when she awoke,

00:20:51.167 --> 00:20:54.128
she had forgotten
almost everything.

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:57.131
All that remained
were memories of the house,

00:20:57.173 --> 00:21:01.886
a few personal effects, and me.

00:21:01.927 --> 00:21:04.472
Everything else was gone.

00:21:07.516 --> 00:21:09.727
During the time that
she was depressed,

00:21:09.769 --> 00:21:13.022
nearly all of her remaining
memories were eaten away.

00:21:14.857 --> 00:21:17.234
But still, she remembers.

00:21:17.276 --> 00:21:19.069
She remembers how to cook.

00:21:19.111 --> 00:21:21.864
And she's still
never forgotten about me.

00:21:21.906 --> 00:21:24.742
She's going outside
and making new memories

00:21:24.784 --> 00:21:29.330
and experiences everyday,
just like you said she should.

00:21:29.371 --> 00:21:32.500
She forgets most of them
by the next morning,

00:21:32.541 --> 00:21:34.877
but I really think
she's enjoying herself

00:21:34.919 --> 00:21:37.379
each and every day.

00:21:37.421 --> 00:21:40.257
[GINKO] Does she still
have trouble sleeping?

00:21:40.299 --> 00:21:43.385
[KAJI] Yeah. She stays up all
night working at the loom,

00:21:43.427 --> 00:21:45.638
just like before.

00:21:45.679 --> 00:21:49.391
I see. Same as always.

00:21:49.433 --> 00:21:52.186
[chuckles]

00:21:52.228 --> 00:21:54.688
That's Mom. Same as always.

00:21:57.858 --> 00:21:59.360
[KAJI]
I'm home!

00:21:59.401 --> 00:22:00.945
Welcome back!

00:22:00.986 --> 00:22:02.321
Dinner's almost ready.

00:22:02.363 --> 00:22:04.073
Go wash your hands
and clean up, okay?

00:22:04.114 --> 00:22:05.574
[KAJI]
Mm-mmm.

00:22:11.121 --> 00:22:12.456
What are you doing?

00:22:12.498 --> 00:22:14.834
You set an extra
place again, Mom.

00:22:14.875 --> 00:22:16.836
Uh.

00:22:16.877 --> 00:22:21.131
So I did. But why did I do that?
It's just you and me.

00:22:21.173 --> 00:22:23.884
I don't... I don't know
why I felt the need

00:22:23.926 --> 00:22:27.471
to do something like that.

00:22:27.513 --> 00:22:29.640
But for some reason,

00:22:29.682 --> 00:22:34.061
setting that extra plate
makes me feel better.

00:22:34.103 --> 00:22:36.063
Why is that?

00:22:38.357 --> 00:22:40.526
[SAYO]
I wonder...

00:23:48.385 --> 00:23:51.764
