[GINKO] I think the <i>tanimodori</i>

00:10:22.872 --> 00:10:25.333
might not be just legends.

00:10:25.375 --> 00:10:28.753
Both of them can be explained
by the <i>nisekazura.</i>

00:10:30.713 --> 00:10:34.509
[GINKO] Usually, the <i>nisekazura</i>
live in the tops of trees.

00:10:34.551 --> 00:10:36.344
But the ones living
in this valley

00:10:36.386 --> 00:10:39.097
are taking over the
bodies of living beings,

00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:42.976
most likely in an attempt
to leave this place.

00:10:43.017 --> 00:10:46.563
They need sunlight in order
to survive, but they lack the

00:10:46.604 --> 00:10:49.607
ability to climb out of
the valley on their own.

00:10:50.859 --> 00:10:52.944
[GINKO] So they reside
in the bodies of animals

00:10:52.986 --> 00:10:56.156
to get more sunlight and
build up their strength.

00:10:56.197 --> 00:10:57.991
Once enough of
them have done so,

00:10:58.032 --> 00:11:00.243
they leave the
bodies of their hosts,

00:11:00.285 --> 00:11:04.873
gather a herd, and begin
to migrate far away.

00:11:04.914 --> 00:11:08.626
To a place more
suitable for them.

00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:11.921
That's probably what
the One-Night Bridge is.

00:11:11.963 --> 00:11:14.674
I've heard a similar
story once before:

00:11:14.716 --> 00:11:17.468
A valley where there is
a crossing of <i>mushi</i>

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:19.929
once every twenty years.

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:23.391
Then why?

00:11:23.433 --> 00:11:26.728
Why is it that the <i>tanimodori</i>
always have to die?

00:11:26.769 --> 00:11:28.605
I mean Shouldn't they
just return to normal

00:11:28.646 --> 00:11:31.274
once the <i>Mushi</i>
leave their bodies?

00:11:31.316 --> 00:11:35.612
I've searched this valley.
There are no animal bones here.

00:11:35.653 --> 00:11:37.822
It's likely that the <i>nisekazura</i>

00:11:37.864 --> 00:11:40.825
are living in the bodies
of the dead, as well.

00:11:40.867 --> 00:11:43.453
If that's the case,
once they leave the body,

00:11:43.494 --> 00:11:46.122
all that would remain
would be the corpse.

I'm not asking you to return
her to the way she was before,

00:12:26.287 --> 00:12:28.998
I just want her to live
a little bit longer.

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.250
Please!

00:12:36.839 --> 00:12:39.008
You don't mean...

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:41.010
I'm afraid so.

00:12:41.052 --> 00:12:43.012
By remaining as she is,

00:12:43.054 --> 00:12:45.890
she stands the best chance
of prolonging her life.

00:12:45.932 --> 00:12:49.602
But this <i>mushi.</i> It is possible
to remove it, right?

00:12:49.644 --> 00:12:51.312
It is.

00:12:51.354 --> 00:12:52.563
But as I said before,

00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:54.774
doing so would most
likely lead to her death.

00:12:54.816 --> 00:12:56.859
Then Just do it.

00:12:56.901 --> 00:12:59.279
Do you think she's
happy living this way?

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:02.490
Even if it's just a remote
chance, it's worth trying.

00:13:02.532 --> 00:13:05.410
But There's no need to do
anything that drastic.

00:13:05.451 --> 00:13:07.620
If she somehow managed
to survive the fall

00:13:07.662 --> 00:13:10.581
three years ago,
then she'll return to normal

00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:12.333
once the One-Night
Bridge appears.

00:13:12.375 --> 00:13:13.876
How can you say that?!

00:13:13.918 --> 00:13:15.712
There's no way to prove
that this "bridge"

00:13:15.753 --> 00:13:17.255
really even exists!

00:13:17.297 --> 00:13:18.715
If Hana returns to normal,

00:13:18.756 --> 00:13:22.343
she has a good marriage
offer waiting for her.

00:13:22.385 --> 00:13:25.596

but I cannot do this.
