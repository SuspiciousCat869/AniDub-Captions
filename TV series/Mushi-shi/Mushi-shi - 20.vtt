[TAMA] And your work?
How's it been going?

Eh... Still the same, I guess.

00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:52.756
So how's Tanyu been?

00:02:52.798 --> 00:02:56.259

[GINKO] Well, I'm caught up

[TAMA] Then you're already at

Thank you.

00:04:11.668 --> 00:04:13.086

The archives are priceless.

00:04:22.179 --> 00:04:24.014

No!

00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:37.504
For once I want to play

Why is studying how to read
and write all I ever do?

And why does
my leg look so strange

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:45.011
and why won't it move?!

[sobs]

00:05:48.306 --> 00:05:53.144
I am sorry, child.
Your life has not been easy.

00:05:53.186 --> 00:05:56.857
And these questions of yours
do deserve answers.

00:05:56.898 --> 00:05:58.817
You're old enough
to understand now.

00:05:58.859 --> 00:06:02.279
Come. I'll tell you everything.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.990
To begin with, that
birthmark on your right leg

00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:08.994
is a remnant of a <i>mushi</i>
sealed away inside you.

00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:11.913
My family and yours have been
connected for generations.

00:06:11.955 --> 00:06:14.624
It was my <i>mushi</i> master
ancestors who sealed

00:06:14.666 --> 00:06:17.669
forbidden <i>mushi</i> away
in the body of your ancestor.

00:06:17.711 --> 00:06:19.254
[TANYU]
Forbidden?

00:06:19.296 --> 00:06:21.131
[TAMA]
Yes.

00:06:21.172 --> 00:06:24.426
To understand, we must first
go back to the beginning.

00:06:24.467 --> 00:06:28.471
Back then, flora and fauna
lived in harmony with <i>mushi</i>.

00:06:28.513 --> 00:06:30.348
Where flora
and fauna flourished,

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:33.143
so too did <i>mushi</i> alongside them.

00:06:33.184 --> 00:06:36.104
Where they died off,
the <i>mushi</i> did as well.

00:06:36.146 --> 00:06:39.858
Once upon a time, a terrible
catastrophe struck the land,

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.444
killing flora, fauna,
and <i>mushi</i> alike.

00:06:42.485 --> 00:06:44.988
It was then that
<i>they</i> first appeared:

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:47.949
a type of <i>mushi</i>
never before encountered.

00:06:47.991 --> 00:06:51.453
One that attempted to erase
all other forms of life.

00:06:51.494 --> 00:06:53.079
What was it like?

00:06:53.121 --> 00:06:55.081
There are no records
of its shape.

00:06:55.123 --> 00:06:58.585
Nor how it was sealed
in your ancestor's body.

00:06:58.627 --> 00:07:03.131
All I know is the story that
my family has passed down.

00:07:03.173 --> 00:07:05.717
Your ancestor was pregnant
when my ancestors

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:08.386
sealed the forbidden
<i>mushi</i> inside of her.

00:07:08.428 --> 00:07:11.806
She managed to survive,
but there was a side effect:

00:07:11.848 --> 00:07:14.893
her body turned
as black as coal.

00:07:14.935 --> 00:07:17.270
The <i>mushi</i> continued
to live inside her body

00:07:17.312 --> 00:07:20.273
until the very end,
when--sadly--

00:07:20.315 --> 00:07:25.070
your ancestor died
giving birth to her child.

00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:28.073
Since then,
once in every few generations

00:07:28.114 --> 00:07:31.076
of the Karibusa family,
a child is born

00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:33.161
with a coal-black birthmark--

00:07:33.203 --> 00:07:36.414
a reminder of
the <i>mushi</i> sealed within.

00:07:38.708 --> 00:07:43.964
[TANYU] You mean the <i>mushi</i>
are... alive inside of me?

00:07:44.005 --> 00:07:46.174
Does that mean that
I'm gonna die, too?!

00:07:46.216 --> 00:07:47.926
I will not let that
happen to you, Tanyu!

00:07:47.968 --> 00:07:49.469
I promise you that!

00:07:49.511 --> 00:07:52.097
You have the power
to put those <i>mushi</i> to sleep.

00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:54.516
Not just for
a while but forever.

00:07:54.557 --> 00:07:57.394
And I will help you do it.

00:07:57.435 --> 00:08:00.313
When you have more fully
mastered the scribe's art,

00:08:00.355 --> 00:08:02.273
we will pack up
the collected knowledge

00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:04.401
recorded by our ancestors.

00:08:04.442 --> 00:08:06.569
We will establish a new archive

00:08:06.611 --> 00:08:09.531
and there we will bury
the forbidden <i>mushi</i> forever.

00:08:09.572 --> 00:08:12.659
When that is done, your black
birthmark will disappear,

00:08:12.701 --> 00:08:14.536
your afflicted leg will heal,

00:08:14.577 --> 00:08:18.331
and you'll finally be able
to walk on it at long last.

00:08:18.373 --> 00:08:20.750
Three ancestors
before you have gradually

00:08:20.792 --> 00:08:22.919
been eradicating those <i>mushi</i>.

00:08:22.961 --> 00:08:25.505
You will be the one
to finally free your family

00:08:25.547 --> 00:08:27.465
from their curse.

00:08:27.507 --> 00:08:31.177
Miss Tanyu,
<i>this</i> is our new home.

00:08:45.108 --> 00:08:48.820
[TANYU]
That old dream again. How odd.

00:08:54.117 --> 00:08:56.202
[TANYU] And so I began
to learn the process of how

00:08:56.244 --> 00:08:59.748
to put the <i>mushi</i> to sleep
under Tama's instruction.

00:08:59.789 --> 00:09:02.167
It was a little
surprising at first.

00:09:05.628 --> 00:09:07.088
[TAMA] You must
write down everything

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:08.381
I'm about to tell you.

00:09:08.423 --> 00:09:12.510
Word for word, note for note.
All of it, Miss Tanyu.

00:09:12.552 --> 00:09:14.554
[TANYU] Tama told me
stories about <i>mushi</i>

00:09:14.596 --> 00:09:17.974
and her experiences slaying
them as a <i>mushi</i> master.

00:09:18.016 --> 00:09:20.060
They seemed like
the stuff of fantasies,

00:09:20.101 --> 00:09:21.895
but they were all true.

00:09:21.936 --> 00:09:24.189
There were so many stories.

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:26.107
One day she might
regale me with tales

00:09:26.149 --> 00:09:28.526
of <i>mushi</i> round-ups,
accompanied by her distinct,

00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:30.528
dramatic flair, of course.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:34.574
And on the next, tell sad
stories by lantern light.

00:09:34.616 --> 00:09:40.038
Fascinating stories of faraway
lands and strange people.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:44.125
However... whenever
I wrote her stories down,

00:09:44.167 --> 00:09:47.295
an intense pain
ran through my birthmark.

00:09:47.337 --> 00:09:50.340
[TANYU] Tama? Are the
<i>mushi</i> leaving my body?

00:09:50.381 --> 00:09:51.716
Is that why it hurts?

00:09:51.758 --> 00:09:54.094
That's correct.
Writing down the stories

00:09:54.135 --> 00:09:56.304
of how I slew
<i>mushi</i> in the past,

00:09:56.346 --> 00:10:00.016
<i>that's</i> what kills the forbidden
ones coursing inside you.

00:10:00.058 --> 00:10:04.020
I realize it's painful,
but you must bear it, Tanyu.

00:10:07.232 --> 00:10:09.692
[TANYU]
Tama. Because of my family,

00:10:09.734 --> 00:10:13.571
your fate was sealed to become
a <i>mushi</i> master, wasn't it?

00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:17.659
You could have had a
different life, a happier one.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.537
Instead, you've had
to take care of me.

00:10:20.578 --> 00:10:24.332
You must hate me
sometimes because of that.

00:10:24.374 --> 00:10:26.584
If I ever had any ill will,

00:10:26.626 --> 00:10:29.170
it completely disappeared the
moment I laid eyes on you

00:10:29.212 --> 00:10:31.297
the day you were born.

00:10:31.339 --> 00:10:35.677
Miss Tanyu, I am grateful
to you and your family.

00:10:37.095 --> 00:10:39.639
[TANYU]
Let's continue. Tell me more.

00:10:39.681 --> 00:10:41.599
Are you sure, Miss?

00:10:41.641 --> 00:10:44.519
[TANYU]
Yes. I'll be fine.

00:10:47.063 --> 00:10:50.483
[TANYU] The pain... Tama did
all she could to ease it,

00:10:50.525 --> 00:10:51.776
but it was something
I had to learn

00:10:51.818 --> 00:10:54.404
how to deal with over time.

00:10:54.445 --> 00:10:57.740
Eventually,
Tama exhausted her stories.

00:10:57.782 --> 00:11:01.369
So she began to invite other
<i>mushi</i> masters to tell theirs.

00:11:01.411 --> 00:11:03.413
And I heard them all.

00:11:03.454 --> 00:11:06.583
There was only one sure way
to wipe out the vermin <i>mushi</i>.

00:11:06.624 --> 00:11:10.378
I found its natural enemy
in the mountains.

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:12.505
The <i>mushi</i> contained
in this vial.

00:11:12.547 --> 00:11:15.091
I released a large number
of them in the area.

00:11:15.133 --> 00:11:18.261
Within a month, you could not
find one vermin <i>mushi</i>.

00:11:18.303 --> 00:11:21.055
Afterwards, I destroyed
those other <i>mushi</i> as well.

00:11:21.097 --> 00:11:24.350
You can't have too many of
their species around, after all.

00:11:24.392 --> 00:11:28.396
But not to worry.
They were easy to dispose of.

00:11:28.438 --> 00:11:30.356
I knew exactly what to do.

00:11:31.649 --> 00:11:34.319
[TANYU] It didn't matter
who was telling the story.

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:38.323
They were all
about one thing: killing.

00:11:40.491 --> 00:11:43.536
The pain in my leg
was nothing compared to

00:11:43.578 --> 00:11:46.789
the immense pain
I felt in my heart.

00:11:46.831 --> 00:11:49.250
This killing was the result
of arrogance toward

00:11:49.292 --> 00:11:52.337
these tiny life forms,
and the unfounded fear

00:11:52.378 --> 00:11:55.089
of things different
from what's familiar.

00:11:55.131 --> 00:11:58.509
No one ever said as much,
but I could sense it.

00:11:58.551 --> 00:12:00.803
I wanted the killing to stop.

00:12:00.845 --> 00:12:02.305
Without killing them?

00:12:02.347 --> 00:12:04.599
I don't know of such stories.

00:12:04.641 --> 00:12:07.018
Look, you're just a child.

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.771
You've never come face
to face with <i>mushi</i> before.

00:12:09.812 --> 00:12:13.358
Only an experienced
<i>mushi</i> master should say such.

00:12:15.902 --> 00:12:20.156
[TANYU] He was right, of course.
Perhaps I was out of line.

00:12:20.198 --> 00:12:22.325
I began to feel like
there was nothing I could do

00:12:22.367 --> 00:12:24.285
to change things.

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:34.712
[TANYU] If I could only
use this leg...

00:12:34.754 --> 00:12:37.048
[GINKO]
Excuse me? Miss?

00:12:38.925 --> 00:12:42.053
Are you one of the Karibusas?

00:12:42.095 --> 00:12:43.388
[TANYU]
Yes.

00:12:43.429 --> 00:12:45.682
[GINKO] I thought so.
I was told that no one else

00:12:45.723 --> 00:12:47.600
lives out in these parts.

00:12:47.642 --> 00:12:50.228
Oh. That must be
the black birthmark

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:52.480
I've heard so much about.

00:12:52.522 --> 00:12:54.816
You must be a <i>mushi</i> master.

00:12:54.857 --> 00:12:57.652
I understand that you collect
stories about <i>mushi</i>.

00:12:57.694 --> 00:12:59.445
And in exchange,
one gets to peruse

00:12:59.487 --> 00:13:02.448
the Karibusa archives, right?

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:05.034
[TANYU]
Sorry, I'm not in the mood.

00:13:05.076 --> 00:13:06.452
I've heard
more than enough tales

00:13:06.494 --> 00:13:09.497
about killing <i>mushi,</i>
thank you.

00:13:09.539 --> 00:13:11.457
Ah. Stories without killing.

00:13:11.499 --> 00:13:13.418
Well then,
this is your lucky day.

00:13:13.459 --> 00:13:14.794
I know a few of those.

00:13:14.836 --> 00:13:16.796
Yes, but I doubt they'd
be of much use to--

00:13:16.838 --> 00:13:18.589
[GINKO] Fine. If you
don't want me to tell you

00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:20.133
about the <i>mushi</i> that eat moles.

00:13:20.174 --> 00:13:21.926
--[TANYU] Moles?
--[GINKO] Hm?

00:13:21.968 --> 00:13:24.095
Oh no, it's nothing.

00:13:25.471 --> 00:13:27.890
Go on. Tell me.

00:13:29.392 --> 00:13:32.312
I wanna hear
all about those <i>mushi.</i>

00:13:37.525 --> 00:13:40.528
[door thuds, squeaks open]

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:42.697
[TANYU] Normally, any <i>mushi</i>
master that passes through

00:13:42.739 --> 00:13:45.616
these doors must get
Tama's permission first.

00:13:45.658 --> 00:13:47.994
To be honest, she probably
wouldn't approve of you,

00:13:48.036 --> 00:13:51.831
so let's just say we keep this
between you and me.

00:13:51.873 --> 00:13:54.709
[door squeaks, clinks]

00:14:02.759 --> 00:14:04.719
[GINKO]
Incredible...

00:14:04.761 --> 00:14:06.429
Listen. You have to be
very careful

00:14:06.471 --> 00:14:08.598
how you handle
the documents here.

00:14:08.639 --> 00:14:10.683
There's a dangerous species
of <i>mushi</i> laying dormant

00:14:10.725 --> 00:14:12.769
in the character strings.

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:15.438
Yeah, I've heard about that.

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:17.190
The forbidden <i>mushi</i>.

00:14:17.231 --> 00:14:20.526
Don't worry.
I'm pretty hard to kill.

00:14:20.568 --> 00:14:25.698
This place. It's like a
goldmine for <i>mushi</i> masters.

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:27.784
Yes. That it is.

00:14:27.825 --> 00:14:30.328
But, everything
in here is a record

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:33.122
of killing and death.

00:14:33.164 --> 00:14:36.084
Let's change that.
I... I want to hear about

00:14:36.125 --> 00:14:41.005
people and animals and <i>mushi</i>
living together in harmony.

00:14:41.047 --> 00:14:42.465
I'll arrange things
with Tama so you can

00:14:42.507 --> 00:14:44.801
come here from time to time.

00:14:44.842 --> 00:14:48.721
All you'd have to do, if you
don't mind, is talk to me.

00:14:48.763 --> 00:14:50.640
My pleasure.

00:14:56.938 --> 00:15:00.566
[TAMA] Miss Tanyu? Oh, you're
already awake, I see.

00:15:00.608 --> 00:15:01.984
[TANYU]
Yes.

00:15:02.026 --> 00:15:06.280
Feel like company?
Ginko's here.

00:15:06.322 --> 00:15:08.658
Then I shouldn't
keep him waiting.

00:15:14.997 --> 00:15:16.499
Huh?

00:15:16.541 --> 00:15:18.292
Is that...?

00:15:21.295 --> 00:15:22.880
[GINKO]
Bookworm eggs...

00:15:22.922 --> 00:15:25.341
[gasps]
They're here!

00:15:25.383 --> 00:15:27.718
And here, too!

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.221
The character strings
are coming apart.

00:15:32.765 --> 00:15:35.726
It's happening, isn't it?

00:15:37.019 --> 00:15:37.770
[TAMA]
Ginko...

00:15:37.812 --> 00:15:39.439
[GINKO]
Tama, bookworms are hatching!

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:40.565
They're eating the paper!

00:15:40.606 --> 00:15:41.774
[gasps]

00:15:41.816 --> 00:15:43.734
[GINKO]
They're breaking the seal!

00:15:48.865 --> 00:15:50.658
[TAMA]
Oh no...

00:15:55.246 --> 00:15:57.123
[TAMA]
Miss Tanyu!

00:15:58.791 --> 00:16:00.251
[TANYU]
What's the matter?

00:16:00.293 --> 00:16:02.545
[TAMA] The <i>mushi</i>! They've
broken through the seal!

00:16:02.587 --> 00:16:03.796
They're escaping!

00:16:03.838 --> 00:16:06.090
And they're heading
straight for you!

00:16:17.393 --> 00:16:20.021
[GINKO]
This isn't looking good.

00:16:20.062 --> 00:16:23.649
[TANYU] Don't worry. There's no
way they can escape this room.

00:16:26.819 --> 00:16:29.655
So you're still alive?
I'm surprised.

00:16:29.697 --> 00:16:31.741
Yeah, so am I.
They sure don't move

00:16:31.782 --> 00:16:33.910
like they've been
dormant for centuries.

00:16:33.951 --> 00:16:35.870
[TANYU chuckles]
Not them.

00:16:35.912 --> 00:16:38.331
I was talking about you, Ginko.

00:16:39.123 --> 00:16:41.250
[GINKO] Like I said,
I'm hard to kill.

00:16:41.292 --> 00:16:45.171
So, can you return these things
to the way they were?

00:16:45.213 --> 00:16:46.881
Don't worry about it.

00:16:46.923 --> 00:16:50.343
I've got a few tricks to
control <i>mushi</i> up my sleeve.

00:16:50.384 --> 00:16:51.719
Tama?

00:16:51.761 --> 00:16:53.137
[TAMA]
Here.

00:16:53.179 --> 00:16:54.597
[gasps]

00:16:56.349 --> 00:16:59.519
[GINKO] The character strings
have stopped moving.

00:17:02.688 --> 00:17:05.024
Careful now. That's a
special sticky paste.

00:17:05.066 --> 00:17:08.069
The room's walls and
ceiling are coated with it.

00:17:09.779 --> 00:17:12.657
Volume one thousand,
eight hundred and fifty-three.

00:17:12.698 --> 00:17:14.242
Chapter one.

00:17:25.795 --> 00:17:27.338
Chapter two.

00:17:29.131 --> 00:17:33.386
These writings.
You know them by heart?

00:17:33.427 --> 00:17:35.680
Well, whether there
are bookworms or not,

00:17:35.721 --> 00:17:39.559
all paper will eventually
disintegrate, Ginko.

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:42.311
From time to time,
I have to recopy the texts.

00:17:42.353 --> 00:17:44.522
Memorization is important.

00:17:44.564 --> 00:17:46.774
Of course, reconfiguring
the texts can be difficult

00:17:46.816 --> 00:17:49.443
while the character strings
are trying to wiggle away.

00:17:49.485 --> 00:17:53.281
But at the same time, I find it
entertaining as well.

00:17:53.322 --> 00:17:55.157
These infernal <i>mushi</i>
have more or less

00:17:55.199 --> 00:17:57.243
become Miss Tanyu's pets.

00:17:57.285 --> 00:17:58.536
Heh.

00:17:58.578 --> 00:18:01.539
Yes, well they can be
rather cute in their own way.

00:18:01.581 --> 00:18:04.000
Do you think it's safe
to keep so many <i>mushi</i> here?

00:18:04.041 --> 00:18:06.627
It's all right. Besides,
I'd have much more trouble

00:18:06.669 --> 00:18:09.255
making copies without them.

00:18:09.297 --> 00:18:12.008
That's quite a dangerous job
you've got there, Tanyu.

00:18:12.049 --> 00:18:15.303
[TANYU] I know,
but it's my family's legacy.

00:18:15.344 --> 00:18:19.682
After all, this is what
I was born and raised to do.

00:18:21.767 --> 00:18:25.396
[GINKO] And so, as generations
before her had done,

00:18:25.438 --> 00:18:29.275
there lived a woman drowning in
a sea of written characters.

00:18:29.317 --> 00:18:30.651
The end.

00:18:30.693 --> 00:18:31.819
[TANYU laughs]

00:18:31.861 --> 00:18:37.033
I know that story.
Tell me another. Please?

00:18:37.074 --> 00:18:39.535
[GINKO]
Hmmm...

00:18:39.577 --> 00:18:42.246
You know, I think
we should call it a day.

00:18:42.288 --> 00:18:43.748
Come on, not yet.

00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:45.082
Less than half
of what you told me

00:18:45.124 --> 00:18:47.668
will be useful
for sealing away <i>mushi</i>.

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:51.589
[GINKO] You had a hard day
yesterday. Don't overdo it.

00:18:54.675 --> 00:18:56.761
Sure, all right.

00:19:02.642 --> 00:19:07.897
Ginko, will you stay
with me until I finish?

00:19:07.938 --> 00:19:09.815
Of course.

00:19:58.948 --> 00:20:02.785
[GINKO] And so there lived a
woman who was ravaged by <i>mushi</i>.

00:20:02.827 --> 00:20:06.747
But instead of hate,
she treated them with love

00:20:06.789 --> 00:20:11.460
and sealed them away forever
without doing any harm.

00:20:11.502 --> 00:20:13.295
The end.

00:20:20.177 --> 00:20:22.221
Is Miss Tanyu done?

00:20:22.263 --> 00:20:24.306
[GINKO]
Yes. She's resting.

00:20:24.348 --> 00:20:26.976
[TANYU]
Ginko.

00:20:27.017 --> 00:20:29.687
I'm okay.
I don't want to rest.

00:20:29.729 --> 00:20:31.230
Instead,

00:20:31.272 --> 00:20:36.235
I want to go outside.
Will you take me there, please?

00:20:47.371 --> 00:20:50.124
[TANYU] This leg of mine.
Sometimes I wonder

00:20:50.166 --> 00:20:54.795
if I'll ever get to use it.
I've waited so long.

00:20:54.837 --> 00:20:57.673
Sure you will.
Your birthmark,

00:20:57.715 --> 00:21:00.384
it's gradually
getting smaller, isn't it?

00:21:00.426 --> 00:21:05.055
Slightly. A little at a time.

00:21:05.097 --> 00:21:07.516
If I don't lose it
before I die,

00:21:07.558 --> 00:21:09.226
my descendants will
inherit the birthmark

00:21:09.268 --> 00:21:11.520
and carry on the curse.

00:21:11.562 --> 00:21:17.109
As it's always been...
for generations now.

00:21:18.819 --> 00:21:22.490
Who knows.
Maybe I'm not the one.

00:21:22.531 --> 00:21:25.117
Maybe I'm not
destined to end it.

00:21:38.798 --> 00:21:40.549
What if you are?

00:21:40.591 --> 00:21:44.428
Your leg--what will
you do if it heals?

00:21:47.223 --> 00:21:52.019
Well, I'd like to
travel with you some.

00:21:52.061 --> 00:21:56.065
Maybe see all the different
<i>mushi</i> you told me about.

00:21:56.106 --> 00:21:58.651
Who knows?
[chuckles]

00:21:58.692 --> 00:22:02.071
Even if it did heal, I'd be an
old lady before I could use it.

00:22:04.824 --> 00:22:08.494
[GINKO]
Hmm...

00:22:08.536 --> 00:22:09.703
I was just kidding.

00:22:09.745 --> 00:22:11.247
[GINKO]
Let's do it.

00:22:11.288 --> 00:22:13.165
That is, of course,

00:22:13.207 --> 00:22:17.795
assuming I'm not
dead by then. It's a deal.

00:22:23.884 --> 00:22:26.011
Then try to stay alive.

00:22:26.053 --> 00:22:27.972
[GINKO]
Easier said than done.

00:22:28.013 --> 00:22:30.683
I could be swallowed whole
by a <i>mushi</i> tomorrow.

00:22:30.724 --> 00:22:32.059
[TANYU] Oh, please.
I thought you were

00:22:32.101 --> 00:22:33.602
supposed to be hard to kill.

00:22:33.644 --> 00:22:38.649
[GINKO] True, but...
I'm just saying.

00:22:38.691 --> 00:22:40.484
[TANYU]
I'm not worried.

00:23:48.844 --> 00:23:51.847
