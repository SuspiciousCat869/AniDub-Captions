The only way I could
stop these feelings,

was to close my eyes.

00:12:00.053 --> 00:12:02.805
And more and more,
the people who came to see me

00:12:02.847 --> 00:12:05.141
only wanted to know if I
could tell them about thieves

00:12:05.183 --> 00:12:08.311
and other criminals
and what they had done.

00:12:08.353 --> 00:12:11.481
Although my eyes drew
lots of people to me,

00:12:11.522 --> 00:12:14.567
they had the opposite effect
on my friends.

00:12:14.609 --> 00:12:17.153
In the end, they all left me.

00:12:18.905 --> 00:12:20.782
[AMANE]
I really can't blame them.

00:12:20.823 --> 00:12:23.368
It must frighten them,
being around someone

00:12:23.409 --> 00:12:25.912
who has the power
to see the future.

00:12:25.954 --> 00:12:27.413
I hate this.

00:12:27.455 --> 00:12:29.832
I can see the future,
but nothing changes.

00:12:32.961 --> 00:12:34.754
[AMANE] I decided to
stop telling people

00:12:34.796 --> 00:12:37.632
what was going
to happen to them.

00:12:37.674 --> 00:12:39.550
But then...

00:12:39.592 --> 00:12:41.052
Something changed.

00:12:43.263 --> 00:12:45.932
[AMANE]
What?! How can...?

00:12:45.974 --> 00:12:48.101
How can I see outside?

00:12:48.142 --> 00:12:50.019
My eyes are closed!

00:12:50.061 --> 00:12:51.145
I'm leaving.

00:12:51.187 --> 00:12:52.563
I'll be back soon.

00:12:55.692 --> 00:12:58.569
[FATHER]
Amane? What's wrong?

00:12:58.611 --> 00:13:01.155
I'm having these visions.

00:13:01.197 --> 00:13:04.867
Your future and the scenery
outside at the same time.

00:13:04.909 --> 00:13:06.786
I'm so dizzy.

00:13:06.828 --> 00:13:09.038
That doesn't sound good.

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.206
[AMANE]
Don't worry.

00:13:10.248 --> 00:13:11.708
I'll get used to it.

00:13:11.749 --> 00:13:13.084
I'll be fine.

00:13:13.126 --> 00:13:14.794
You take it easy.

00:13:14.836 --> 00:13:16.546
I won't be gone long.

00:13:18.172 --> 00:13:22.010
[AMANE] Sadly, my father
wasn't able to keep his word.

00:13:22.051 --> 00:13:23.636
He never came back.

00:13:26.097 --> 00:13:27.307
When he didn't return,

00:13:27.348 --> 00:13:30.226
I went to the mountains
every day to look for him.

00:13:30.268 --> 00:13:32.895
I knew my eyes would
eventually find him.

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:38.109
And one day, they finally did.

00:13:38.151 --> 00:13:40.194
I saw my father.

00:13:40.236 --> 00:13:42.572
He was lying dead
at the bottom of a ravine.

00:13:44.699 --> 00:13:47.493
I set out to pay
my final respects.

00:13:47.535 --> 00:13:49.412
I knew I'd need some way
to support myself,

00:13:49.454 --> 00:13:51.497
so I brought my lute along.

00:13:51.539 --> 00:13:54.292
I sang songs about the stories
I'd heard from my father

00:13:54.334 --> 00:13:57.420
and lived off the
tips people gave me.

00:13:57.462 --> 00:14:00.715
When I eventually arrived
at his final resting place,

00:14:00.757 --> 00:14:03.843
I no longer had any desire
to return to our village.

00:14:03.885 --> 00:14:08.014
With my father now gone, I had
no reason to go back there.

00:14:08.056 --> 00:14:11.851
Since then, I've just been
traveling from place to place

00:14:11.893 --> 00:14:14.187
and playing my lute
on the streets for a living.

00:14:20.693 --> 00:14:21.778
[AMANE]
As time went on,

00:14:21.819 --> 00:14:24.322
I could see more and more
through my eyelids.

00:14:24.364 --> 00:14:27.116
The past, the future...
everything.

00:14:27.158 --> 00:14:29.494
Nothing could obstruct my view.

00:14:29.535 --> 00:14:31.412
It was tough on my eyes
sometimes during the day

00:14:31.454 --> 00:14:34.624
to stand the light,
but I managed.

00:14:34.665 --> 00:14:36.250
But strangely enough,

00:14:36.292 --> 00:14:39.587
there was still one thing
that I could never see.

00:14:39.629 --> 00:14:41.464
And that was...

00:14:41.506 --> 00:14:42.924
...my own future.

00:14:45.426 --> 00:14:47.136
That's changed, however.

00:14:47.178 --> 00:14:50.640
I am able to see my future now.

00:14:50.681 --> 00:14:53.184
You passing through
this village...

00:14:53.226 --> 00:14:54.143
The tip you gave me...

00:14:54.185 --> 00:14:57.188
The conversation we're
having in this room.

00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:01.609
Well, I...
I foresaw all of this.

00:15:01.651 --> 00:15:04.320
Really? Is that the
reason you asked me

00:15:04.362 --> 00:15:06.197
to take your eyes?

00:15:06.239 --> 00:15:09.242
Bury them in the mountains
when the time comes?

00:15:09.283 --> 00:15:12.078
I normally don't ask
for help from anyone.

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:15.415
But in this case,
I have no choice.

00:15:15.456 --> 00:15:16.624
It's funny.

00:15:16.666 --> 00:15:18.501
My eyes once
brought me so much joy.

00:15:18.543 --> 00:15:20.628
That's how I've lived with them.

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:22.380
But now, after all
of the visions,

00:15:22.422 --> 00:15:25.174
I've just grown to hate them.

00:15:25.216 --> 00:15:26.843
I guess I should feel lucky.

00:15:26.884 --> 00:15:28.219
I've forseen that
this pair of eyes

00:15:28.261 --> 00:15:31.139
won't belong to me
for much longer.

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:33.891
It'll be just like
the <i>ganpuku</i> I saw.

00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:36.894
I'll lose my eyes,
but it'll stay inside them.

00:15:36.936 --> 00:15:37.895
It'll go underground,

00:15:37.937 --> 00:15:41.441
and then wait for a new pair of
eyes to come along to claim.

00:15:41.482 --> 00:15:43.401
I don't want anyone else
to have to go through

00:15:43.443 --> 00:15:45.862
the same misery that I have.

00:15:45.903 --> 00:15:49.824
That's why I want you to bury
my eyes deep in the mountains.

00:15:49.866 --> 00:15:53.578
You said that you
foresaw all this?

00:15:55.913 --> 00:15:57.582
I don't get it.

00:15:57.623 --> 00:16:01.002
Why didn't you ask
if they could be healed?

00:16:01.043 --> 00:16:04.088
For all we know,
there might be a cure.

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:05.715
I just told you.

00:16:05.756 --> 00:16:08.676
The things that I see
can't be changed.

00:16:08.718 --> 00:16:11.345
The things that my eyes see...

00:16:11.387 --> 00:16:13.848
They're already
destined to happen.

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:17.351
There's nothing you, or I, or
anyone can do to change them.

00:16:29.405 --> 00:16:31.449
[GINKO]
Hey. Listen.

00:16:31.491 --> 00:16:34.202
I still can't swallow everything
you've told me tonight,

00:16:34.243 --> 00:16:36.496
but I can't just
sit around here.

00:16:36.537 --> 00:16:39.624
Let me try to help, at least.

00:16:39.665 --> 00:16:41.667
You can write your
letter if you want,

00:16:41.709 --> 00:16:45.004
but your friend has no answers.

00:16:45.046 --> 00:16:46.380
Is that so?

00:16:47.673 --> 00:16:50.676
Why are you so
willing to help me, Ginko?

00:16:50.718 --> 00:16:53.846
Is it because you
lost your left eye?

00:16:53.888 --> 00:16:56.265
[GINKO] You can see
the past, can't you?

00:16:56.307 --> 00:16:57.683
Well, In your case...

00:16:57.725 --> 00:17:02.480
No, I can't. Your childhood
is all black to me.

00:17:02.522 --> 00:17:05.149
[GINKO] You want to know
what my earliest memory is?

00:17:05.191 --> 00:17:06.817
I was ten.

00:17:06.859 --> 00:17:09.654
I was walking alone
somewhere in the dark.

00:17:09.695 --> 00:17:12.865
I couldn't see anything at all.

00:17:12.907 --> 00:17:15.660
I tried to grope my way
through that darkness,

00:17:15.701 --> 00:17:18.496
but it seemed endless, hopeless.

00:17:18.538 --> 00:17:21.040
Until the moon came out.

00:17:21.082 --> 00:17:23.876
It was snow-white,
almost unreal-looking,

00:17:23.918 --> 00:17:25.378
and was slowly setting,

00:17:25.419 --> 00:17:28.381
just as another moon
started to rise.

00:17:28.422 --> 00:17:31.175
I walked for a long time.

00:17:31.217 --> 00:17:33.219
Eventually, I came to a place

00:17:33.261 --> 00:17:35.304
where I could see
the sun rising.

00:17:36.973 --> 00:17:39.559
I used to appreciate
it back then.

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:42.395
The sunlight and its warmth.

00:17:42.436 --> 00:17:43.896
What about you?

00:17:43.938 --> 00:17:46.566
Aren't you scared of
losing light forever?

00:17:46.607 --> 00:17:47.858
Won't you miss it?

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:50.528
[AMANE]
Of course I will.

00:17:51.821 --> 00:17:56.576
But... a world with
only light is just as scary.

00:17:56.617 --> 00:17:58.995
I can see everything,
like I do right now,

00:17:59.036 --> 00:18:01.914
but I can do nothing
to change things.

00:18:01.956 --> 00:18:03.082
Or I can see nothing,

00:18:03.124 --> 00:18:06.085
and live free
from these visions.

00:18:06.127 --> 00:18:09.171
Which one do you think
would make me happier?

00:18:09.213 --> 00:18:11.841
Honestly, I'd
prefer to see nothing.

00:18:11.882 --> 00:18:13.467
Living in the darkness
and still being able

00:18:13.509 --> 00:18:15.303
to remember the light...

00:18:15.344 --> 00:18:17.930
Well... I don't think
that's a bad thing at all.

00:18:24.937 --> 00:18:25.938
[AMANE gasps]

00:18:28.816 --> 00:18:30.192
[AMANE whimpers]

00:18:33.988 --> 00:18:35.031
[AMANE whimpers]

00:18:36.365 --> 00:18:37.533
[GINKO]
What's wrong?!

00:18:38.909 --> 00:18:40.536
I'm okay.

00:18:40.578 --> 00:18:43.581
I just... I saw it again.

00:18:43.623 --> 00:18:47.084
A vision? What was it? Tell me.

00:18:47.126 --> 00:18:51.297
The very last thing my
eyeballs see before they die.

00:18:56.719 --> 00:18:58.095
[GINKO]
Her eyes...

00:18:58.137 --> 00:19:01.932
They weren't always able
to see through her eyelids.

00:19:01.974 --> 00:19:04.560
She could only see
other people's futures.

00:19:04.602 --> 00:19:07.229
But now, she can see
through her eyelids,

00:19:07.271 --> 00:19:11.275
and she's able to see
her own future. Interesting.

00:19:11.317 --> 00:19:12.610
I wonder...

00:19:12.652 --> 00:19:16.656
Does that mean she's become
another person to her eyeballs?

00:19:16.697 --> 00:19:20.368
A <i>mushi</i> that lives in someone's
eyes after they look at it...

00:19:20.409 --> 00:19:22.662
It then changes the eyeballs
into something else

00:19:22.703 --> 00:19:26.332
so that they can live on
after the person dies.

00:19:26.374 --> 00:19:28.751
Once the eyes are
completely taken over,

00:19:28.793 --> 00:19:31.295
the <i>mushi</i> leaves.

00:19:31.337 --> 00:19:35.466
If that's the case, the time
for it to leave must be close.

00:19:35.508 --> 00:19:37.927
And still no reply
from my friend.

00:19:51.315 --> 00:19:54.902
[GINKO] Changing things
destined to happen...

00:19:54.944 --> 00:19:56.821
Is it even possible?

00:20:04.328 --> 00:20:05.955
[AMANE]
Wait, why...

00:20:05.996 --> 00:20:08.165
Why can't I see
behind the ceiling?

00:20:10.793 --> 00:20:12.253
What happened?

00:20:14.296 --> 00:20:17.133
[AMANE]
I can see. Normally.

00:20:19.635 --> 00:20:21.887
[AMANE]
Huh? My...

00:20:21.929 --> 00:20:25.766
My eyeballs! They're
moving by themselves!

00:20:25.808 --> 00:20:26.892
[AMANE gasps]

00:20:28.352 --> 00:20:29.395
[GINKO gasps]

00:20:35.443 --> 00:20:38.154
[AMANE whimpering]

00:20:38.195 --> 00:20:40.614
Hold on!
I'll give you a painkiller.

00:20:40.656 --> 00:20:43.075
[AMANE crying]

00:20:46.203 --> 00:20:50.374
[AMANE] Isn't it strange?
I don't have eyeballs anymore,

00:20:50.416 --> 00:20:53.544
but somehow tears still flow.

00:21:10.436 --> 00:21:14.231
[GINKO]
A vision? What was it? Tell me.

00:21:14.273 --> 00:21:15.900
[AMANE]
The very last thing

00:21:15.941 --> 00:21:18.444
my eyeballs see before they die.

00:21:20.154 --> 00:21:22.239
After leaving my body,

00:21:22.281 --> 00:21:26.660
they were buried in the ground
high in the mountains.

00:21:26.702 --> 00:21:29.997
After a while, they revealed
themselves from the ground,

00:21:30.039 --> 00:21:32.458
and a fox walked towards them.

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:34.376
The fox was captivated,

00:21:34.418 --> 00:21:37.963
and two beautiful flowers
suddenly reflected in its eyes.

00:21:38.005 --> 00:21:41.634
They were slowly absorbed
until they faded away.

00:21:41.675 --> 00:21:44.136
Then everything went dark.

00:21:44.178 --> 00:21:48.224
And that... is the
last thing I ever see.

00:21:50.726 --> 00:21:51.894
[AMANE]
I know it's too late,

00:21:51.936 --> 00:21:54.730
but did you ever receive
a reply from your friend?

00:22:04.323 --> 00:22:06.992
[GINKO] Will you go back
to your village?

00:22:07.034 --> 00:22:09.203
One day... Maybe.

00:22:10.579 --> 00:22:12.248
Right now I'm not sure.

00:22:12.289 --> 00:22:14.583
Who knows what the future holds?

00:22:14.625 --> 00:22:18.712
I don't know, for a change,
and I'm thankful.

00:22:18.754 --> 00:22:20.548
Thanks for all your help.

00:22:20.589 --> 00:22:24.635
If you ever happen to see me,
please say hello.

00:22:24.677 --> 00:22:25.636
Who knows?

00:22:25.678 --> 00:22:28.097
Maybe I'll have a new song
to sing by then.

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:51.555
