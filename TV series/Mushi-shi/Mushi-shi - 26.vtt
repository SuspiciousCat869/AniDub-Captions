WEBVTT

00:00:16.225 --> 00:00:18.268
[TAKU]
When I was a boy,

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.062
I was always curious
about the people

00:00:20.103 --> 00:00:22.523
who roamed in the valley mist.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.777
[TAKU]
Every year,

00:00:26.818 --> 00:00:30.113
they would appear before
the May showers began,

00:00:30.155 --> 00:00:34.660
and then disappear soon after,
when the storms ended.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:37.621
[TAKU]
Hm?

00:01:06.358 --> 00:01:08.235
[FUMI]
Young master!

00:01:09.695 --> 00:01:11.780
[FUMI]
I thought I'd find you here.

00:01:11.822 --> 00:01:13.824
The master is calling for you.

00:01:24.543 --> 00:01:27.296
That beautiful purple
mist has returned.

00:01:28.589 --> 00:01:29.798
What are you talking about?

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.302
Looks like plain,
ordinary mist to me.

00:01:33.343 --> 00:01:35.846
You are such an odd child.

00:01:42.978 --> 00:01:44.813
[TAKU'S FATHER]
Ah, that's right.

00:01:44.855 --> 00:01:46.356
It's already time
for the mist people

00:01:46.398 --> 00:01:48.442
to come through here, isn't it?

00:01:48.483 --> 00:01:51.111
Guess I should get the
storm shutters fixed.

00:01:52.362 --> 00:01:54.072
Father, those people.

00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:56.825
Don't you worry about
what they're up to?

00:01:56.867 --> 00:01:57.618
No.

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.287
They've been coming
here for a long time

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.706
and they've never once
caused any trouble.

00:02:02.748 --> 00:02:06.168
They simply guard the mountain
and talk amongst themselves.

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:10.714
All right, but what exactly
is it that they do?

00:02:10.756 --> 00:02:14.760
Well, to be honest, I'm not
sure what they do for a living.

00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:17.387
I've never been deeply
involved with them.

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:19.222
They've never asked
for much of anything,

00:02:19.264 --> 00:02:22.476
and they keep to themselves.

00:02:22.517 --> 00:02:25.020
I've heard that they know
a lot about foreign lands,

00:02:25.062 --> 00:02:26.271
and that they're a friendly and

00:02:26.313 --> 00:02:28.231
amusing group of
people to talk to.

00:02:28.273 --> 00:02:31.818
But beyond that,
they're a mystery.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.028
What about our water?

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.739
They might take some
from the waterfall.

00:02:35.781 --> 00:02:39.201
Why should we deny some thirsty
travelers a drink of water?

00:02:39.242 --> 00:02:40.744
It's not like they'd
try to reroute it

00:02:40.786 --> 00:02:43.538
to their fields
like the villagers.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.248
I don't like outsiders coming

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.209
and going through
here as they please.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.128
Taku. The heir to this
family shouldn't be saying

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.714
such stingy and selfish things.

00:02:52.756 --> 00:02:54.299
Just think of
them as the birds

00:02:54.341 --> 00:02:56.551
that migrate through
the changing seasons.

00:02:56.593 --> 00:02:57.678
Let them be.

00:02:57.719 --> 00:02:59.471
They'll be gone soon enough.

00:03:05.477 --> 00:03:07.854
[rustling]

00:03:07.896 --> 00:03:08.897
[TAKU]
Hm?

00:03:13.652 --> 00:03:16.947
Hey! Catch anything?

00:03:16.988 --> 00:03:19.449
The fish can see
you from there.

00:03:22.494 --> 00:03:24.162
[grunts] What are you
think you're doing?

00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:25.914
Don't take so many fish!

00:03:25.956 --> 00:03:29.668
Do you hear me?
This is my mountain!

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.461
Your mountain?

00:03:31.503 --> 00:03:33.839
So you're the "Master" here?

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.799
I'm the son of the owner.

00:03:35.841 --> 00:03:37.592
[ISAZA]
Really?

00:03:37.634 --> 00:03:40.137
[footsteps]

00:03:40.178 --> 00:03:43.598
[gasps]
A "Master's" son.

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:47.477
[ISAZA] Guess I should
give these back then,

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.773
or, at least I should.
but we want something to eat.

00:03:51.815 --> 00:03:54.359
Could you spare one
fish per person?

00:03:56.528 --> 00:03:59.197
I guess that would be okay.

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.450
Thanks a lot.

00:04:01.491 --> 00:04:03.618
I'll give the rest
to the "Master".

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.581
I'm Isaza of the Watari.

00:04:07.622 --> 00:04:09.750
I'll be staying around this
mountain for a little while.

00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:10.959
Pleased to meet you.

00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:14.296
[ISAZA]
You sure are a strange one.

00:04:14.337 --> 00:04:16.965
A "Master" who's bad at fishing.

00:04:19.384 --> 00:04:22.637
[FUMI] My goodness!
You caught so many today!

00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:25.807
How would you like
me to cook them?

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:28.185
[TAKU] What's with him?
There's nothing that says,

00:04:28.226 --> 00:04:30.979
"A Master's son must
be good at fishing."

00:04:43.742 --> 00:04:46.745
[TAKU grunts]

00:04:46.787 --> 00:04:50.081
[gasps] Where did these
stupid things come from?

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:52.501
[ISAZA laughs]

00:04:52.542 --> 00:04:55.712
I gotcha! You big liar.

00:04:55.754 --> 00:04:57.547
My Grandfather told
me that the real

00:04:57.589 --> 00:05:00.217
"Master" of this
mountain is elsewhere.

00:05:00.258 --> 00:05:01.843
I'm not a liar!

00:05:01.885 --> 00:05:03.345
My family bought this land

00:05:03.386 --> 00:05:06.556
a little at a time
for generations!

00:05:06.598 --> 00:05:09.309
They "bought" it?

00:05:09.351 --> 00:05:11.978
And that makes you think you're
the "Master" of this place?

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.647
This land isn't something
that can be bought

00:05:13.688 --> 00:05:15.690
and sold like that.

00:05:15.732 --> 00:05:18.193
I know. It's not like that.

00:05:18.235 --> 00:05:20.111
This is a special
mountain, isn't it?

00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:21.530
My family knows that.

00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:23.281
The land that surrounds
us is fertile

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:24.282
because of this mountain,

00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:27.911
so my family has been
protecting it all this time.

00:05:27.953 --> 00:05:29.538
My father is the one
preventing everyone

00:05:29.579 --> 00:05:30.664
from damming the waterfall

00:05:30.705 --> 00:05:33.124
and routing it to
the villager's fields.

00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:38.088
So tell me, did a <i>mushi</i>
master tell you to do that?

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:41.758
[gasps] Yeah! I think
that's what he was called.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.344
He told my ancestors
to protect this place.

00:05:44.386 --> 00:05:47.514
He said that if we didn't,
the mountain would get sick.

00:05:48.974 --> 00:05:51.226
[ISAZA]
I see.

00:05:51.268 --> 00:05:54.187
So this place is
important to you, too.

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:57.107
And your family protects it.

00:05:57.148 --> 00:05:59.651
I guess that's okay then.

00:05:59.693 --> 00:06:01.403
I was going to tell you
to return those fish

00:06:01.444 --> 00:06:03.530
from yesterday.
Sorry about that.

00:06:03.572 --> 00:06:04.489
[grunts]

00:06:04.531 --> 00:06:05.782
[ISAZA]
See you later.

00:06:05.824 --> 00:06:07.284
[TAKU]
Wait.

00:06:07.325 --> 00:06:09.160
I'll return those fish
if you gave them to me

00:06:09.202 --> 00:06:11.079
out of a misunderstanding.

00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:13.498
I've no need to be
indebted to you.

00:06:18.503 --> 00:06:20.463
Any luck?

00:06:20.505 --> 00:06:22.799
Just a little bit longer.

00:06:22.841 --> 00:06:25.510
Come on, I've already
caught enough for everyone.

00:06:25.552 --> 00:06:27.387
I said just a little longer!

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:31.725
[TAKU] You mentioned a
different "Master" earlier.

00:06:31.766 --> 00:06:34.060
Who is that?

00:06:34.102 --> 00:06:37.147
The big catfish that lives
in the waterfall basin.

00:06:38.648 --> 00:06:41.318
[TAKU] The what?
Who decided that?

00:06:41.359 --> 00:06:42.444
[ISAZA]
The mountain.

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:44.988
Those who are to
become "Masters"

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.033
are born with moss
growing on their body.

00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:50.160
That's how you can spot them.

00:06:50.201 --> 00:06:51.202
[gasps]

00:06:53.997 --> 00:06:57.959
Then I've seen him before!
A catfish with moss on its head!

00:06:58.001 --> 00:07:00.295
Really? I'm jealous.

00:07:00.337 --> 00:07:02.088
Hey, tell me something.

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.174
Have you ever seen
a purple mist,

00:07:04.215 --> 00:07:07.427
swelling and twisting
around like it was alive?

00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:08.845
Of course I have.

00:07:08.887 --> 00:07:11.765
This area is a <i>Koumyaku.</i>

00:07:11.806 --> 00:07:12.807
Huh?

00:07:14.392 --> 00:07:17.103
It's the source of life that
flows through this land.

00:07:20.315 --> 00:07:21.733
[ISAZA]
It mixes with the water,

00:07:21.775 --> 00:07:24.611
evaporates, and then
becomes precipitation.

00:07:24.653 --> 00:07:27.072
That's why the mist here
has a life of its own.

00:07:29.616 --> 00:07:32.035
[ISAZA] That's also
why it changes color.

00:07:32.077 --> 00:07:34.037
You can tell what the
condition of the land is

00:07:34.079 --> 00:07:37.207
from day to day by watching
the hue of the mist.

00:07:39.042 --> 00:07:40.085
[TAKU]
Huh...

00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:41.127
[gasps]

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:45.215
[ISAZA] Quick!
Be careful! Don't panic!

00:07:45.256 --> 00:07:46.675
[TAKU]
Shut up!

00:07:47.926 --> 00:07:50.553
[TAKU] It's still
not enough, but here.

00:07:50.595 --> 00:07:52.180
See ya'.

00:07:52.222 --> 00:07:54.766
[ISAZA] You know; I've told
you about a lot of things.

00:07:54.808 --> 00:07:58.144
Next time, you should
tell me something.

00:07:58.186 --> 00:07:58.895
Like what?

00:07:58.937 --> 00:08:01.439
I don't know about
anything special, like you.

00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:03.984
[ISAZA]
It can be about anything.

00:08:04.025 --> 00:08:05.777
You know, stories.

00:08:05.819 --> 00:08:07.946
Things that happen
in the village.

00:08:11.032 --> 00:08:16.037
[MEN chatter, laugh]

00:08:19.624 --> 00:08:22.043
[UNCLE] Well! If it isn't
young Master Taku.

00:08:22.085 --> 00:08:25.088
What's the occasion? You usually
don't come out to join us.

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:26.006
I was just hoping

00:08:26.047 --> 00:08:29.009
that I might be able to listen
to some interesting stories.

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:32.012
Then you're just in time!
I was about to tell the Master

00:08:32.053 --> 00:08:34.764
some things that happened
to me while I was traveling.

00:08:34.806 --> 00:08:36.433
Please. Have a seat.

00:08:38.184 --> 00:08:40.937
[ISAZA chuckles]
Are you serious? Is that true?

00:08:40.979 --> 00:08:42.439
[TAKU laughs]
Who knows?

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.483
My Uncle tends to exaggerate
when he's telling a story.

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:50.321
[TAKU] Oh! He also said
he saw a strange kid

00:08:50.363 --> 00:08:53.867
in a village two
mountains south of here.

00:08:53.908 --> 00:08:55.744
He was about ten years old.

00:08:55.785 --> 00:08:58.121
He had white hair,
and green eyes.

00:08:58.163 --> 00:09:00.081
He was actually
missing one of them.

00:09:00.123 --> 00:09:03.960
Yeah? I wonder why?
Was he a foreigner?

00:09:04.002 --> 00:09:07.130
He didn't know, but it
didn't seem like he was.

00:09:07.172 --> 00:09:10.550
Huh. Two mountains
to the south, huh?

00:09:10.592 --> 00:09:13.178
That's the same direction we'll
be headed when we leave.

00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:15.472
Maybe I'll meet him.

00:09:15.513 --> 00:09:19.392
[gasps] That's right. The rains
are almost over for this season.

00:09:19.434 --> 00:09:21.478
When will you be leaving?

00:09:21.519 --> 00:09:22.896
I don't know.

00:09:22.937 --> 00:09:26.399
My Grandfather looks at the mist
every morning and decides.

00:09:28.193 --> 00:09:29.360
How does that help?

00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:31.112
[ISAZA]
If the mist has a blue tint,

00:09:31.154 --> 00:09:34.032
the mountain's energy
moves silently and swiftly.

00:09:34.074 --> 00:09:36.242
If it's reddish,
it's the opposite.

00:09:36.284 --> 00:09:39.287
When it's golden, the mountain
is in the best mood.

00:09:39.329 --> 00:09:41.664
That's the best day to leave.

00:09:41.706 --> 00:09:45.794
Huh. Sounds like an easy
way to make decisions.

00:09:49.756 --> 00:09:52.175
[ISAZA]
Are you jealous?

00:09:52.217 --> 00:09:54.928
[TAKU] My future has
already been decided for me.

00:09:56.638 --> 00:09:57.639
I'm going to live here

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:01.309
and look after this mountain,
just like my father.

00:10:01.351 --> 00:10:03.353
So yeah. I'm jealous.

00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:10.401
[ISAZA]
Hm. I see.

00:10:21.079 --> 00:10:23.373
[WATARI] Take a look at this.
It's a detailed map

00:10:23.414 --> 00:10:25.917
of the <i>Koumyaku's</i> path
through the mountain.

00:10:25.959 --> 00:10:29.754
[MUSHI-SHI 1] I see. Then I'll
take the map, as well.

00:10:29.796 --> 00:10:31.381
[WATARI]
Very good.

00:10:31.422 --> 00:10:32.674
[MUSHI-SHI 1]
And Isaza.

00:10:32.715 --> 00:10:34.592
Thanks for that
information the other day.

00:10:34.634 --> 00:10:36.970
It helped me quite a bit.

00:10:37.011 --> 00:10:38.179
Keep me posted.

00:10:38.221 --> 00:10:39.639
[ISAZA]
Sure.

00:10:44.269 --> 00:10:46.104
[ISAZA]
That's how we make our living.

00:10:46.146 --> 00:10:47.772
We sell information
about the <i>mushi</i>

00:10:47.814 --> 00:10:51.401
and changes in the <i>Koumyaku's</i>
line to the <i>mushi</i> Masters.

00:10:51.442 --> 00:10:52.610
We can't support ourselves

00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:55.280
just by watching over
the light vein alone.

00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:57.157
It helps out everyone.

00:10:58.783 --> 00:11:01.703
You should have told
me that to being with.

00:11:01.744 --> 00:11:04.914
I would have tried to find some
more strange stories for you.

00:11:06.291 --> 00:11:07.709
No. That wouldn't help.

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:09.627
If I didn't know
what was normal,

00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:13.548
then I wouldn't know when
something strange was going on.

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:16.801
And besides, I like hearing
about the village.

00:11:20.221 --> 00:11:21.681
[scoffs]
Whatever.

00:11:21.723 --> 00:11:24.184
Wait. What do
you mean, "Whatever"?

00:11:24.225 --> 00:11:26.644
I mean I understand
everything now.

00:11:26.686 --> 00:11:28.104
[ISAZA]
What are you mad about?

00:11:28.146 --> 00:11:30.607
Shut up! Just leave me alone.

00:11:31.941 --> 00:11:36.362
That's just how I do things.
I won't apologize for anything.

00:11:36.404 --> 00:11:38.823
I didn't ask you to apologize.

00:11:48.291 --> 00:11:50.668
[FUMI grunts]
I hate this weather!

00:11:54.172 --> 00:11:56.382
[FUMI] The monsoon
season's almost over.

00:11:56.424 --> 00:11:58.468
Maybe this will be the last one.

00:12:05.433 --> 00:12:10.480
[footsteps]

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.532
[grunts]

00:12:23.618 --> 00:12:26.204
[TAKU]
It's so hot.

00:12:26.246 --> 00:12:31.209
[cicadas shirp]

00:12:33.002 --> 00:12:34.212
[TAKU]
Isaza?

00:12:40.635 --> 00:12:42.262
[TAKU]
It's golden.

00:12:52.939 --> 00:12:56.484
[TAKU]
Then, the following year.

00:12:56.526 --> 00:13:00.989
At the same time
as always, they returned.

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:02.615
But the people that
made up their group

00:13:02.657 --> 00:13:05.285
were a little different
from the year before.

00:13:09.205 --> 00:13:11.541
[ISAZA]
Yeah. We picked him up.

00:13:11.582 --> 00:13:14.002
That story you told me
turned out to be true.

00:13:14.043 --> 00:13:16.254
We found him wandering
around the village.

00:13:16.296 --> 00:13:19.340
He didn't have
anywhere to go, so...

00:13:19.382 --> 00:13:21.634
He may look strange,
but he's very nice.

00:13:21.676 --> 00:13:23.928
His name's Ginko.

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:26.097
[TAKU]
Hm.

00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:30.184
[ISAZA] But I don't think he'll
be with us for very long.

00:13:30.226 --> 00:13:33.187
He has a condition
that attracts <i>mushi.</i>

00:13:33.229 --> 00:13:35.481
If he stays near the
light vein for too long,

00:13:35.523 --> 00:13:39.861
then either he or the vein
itself will be affected.

00:13:39.902 --> 00:13:41.654
He'll probably be
placed under the care

00:13:41.696 --> 00:13:44.198
of a <i>mushi</i> Master
in the near future.

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:49.495
[TAKU]
Fumi! What's wrong?

00:13:49.537 --> 00:13:50.705
Young Master!

00:13:50.747 --> 00:13:52.206
It's your father!

00:13:52.248 --> 00:13:55.043
He's... The Master has...

00:13:56.794 --> 00:13:57.879
[TAKU'S MOTHER]
Like I said,

00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:01.632
the will states that the entire
mountain is to be given to Taku.

00:14:01.674 --> 00:14:03.259
[MALE RELATIVE 1]
I know, I know,

00:14:03.301 --> 00:14:05.678
but do you really think
he'll be able to handle this

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.263
all by himself?

00:14:07.305 --> 00:14:10.683
The village is still growing,
and there's not enough water.

00:14:10.725 --> 00:14:12.977
We need to re-route
it from the basin.

00:14:13.019 --> 00:14:15.855
[MALE RELATIVE 2] Please,
let us take care of things.

00:14:15.897 --> 00:14:17.648
We won't let you down.

00:14:26.157 --> 00:14:30.244
[footsteps]

00:14:30.286 --> 00:14:31.704
[ISAZA]
Taku.

00:14:34.874 --> 00:14:36.834
[ISAZA]
Hey... Taku.

00:14:41.339 --> 00:14:43.966
I heard from the
mountain guards.

00:14:44.008 --> 00:14:48.179
I'm sorry... about your father.

00:14:48.221 --> 00:14:52.809
You haven't come to the
mountain for quite some time.

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:54.310
Are you all right?

00:14:55.478 --> 00:14:59.190
[TAKU]
I... I tried, but...

00:14:59.232 --> 00:15:01.818
...I couldn't
protect the mountain.

00:15:01.859 --> 00:15:05.029
It was taken away
by my relatives.

00:15:05.071 --> 00:15:06.697
They're going to
dam the waterfall,

00:15:06.739 --> 00:15:09.325
and the land will be devastated.

00:15:09.367 --> 00:15:11.494
I'm sorry.

00:15:11.536 --> 00:15:14.705
[ISAZA]
Taku. Please...

00:15:14.747 --> 00:15:15.832
Listen to me.

00:15:15.873 --> 00:15:19.836
There's something wrong with
the mountain. It's restless.

00:15:19.877 --> 00:15:23.631
The ground is hot,
and there's a strange scent.

00:15:23.673 --> 00:15:27.885
The animals are leaving, and the
<i>Koumyaku</i> has started to shift.

00:15:29.303 --> 00:15:32.140
We're going to leave
and follow it.

00:15:32.181 --> 00:15:33.891
Take care of yourself.

00:15:35.268 --> 00:15:37.728
Wait. So you're not coming back?

00:15:39.689 --> 00:15:41.107
I don't know.

00:15:45.486 --> 00:15:48.114
[TAKU]
Please. Let me go.

00:15:48.156 --> 00:15:50.199
I wanna join you.

00:15:50.241 --> 00:15:53.619
I don't... I don't
wanna stay here.

00:15:53.661 --> 00:15:55.455
Please, take me with you.

00:15:55.496 --> 00:15:59.834
Like they you took that
Ginko kid with you before.

00:15:59.876 --> 00:16:02.253
I can see the colors
of the mist, too!

00:16:02.295 --> 00:16:04.005
And it's not like I
have to be related

00:16:04.046 --> 00:16:06.048
to any of you to join, right?

00:16:07.091 --> 00:16:09.510
[ISAZA]
None of us are related by blood.

00:16:09.552 --> 00:16:13.139
The old man I call Grandfather
decides who comes with us.

00:16:14.974 --> 00:16:16.309
[ISAZA]
I'll ask him.

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:19.687
Come to the waterfall
tomorrow morning.

00:16:31.032 --> 00:16:32.033
[gasps]

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:37.747
[TAKU]
The mist is pure white.

00:16:39.081 --> 00:16:43.211
[TAKU]
Something's wrong. Very wrong.

00:16:43.252 --> 00:16:45.671
This has never
happened before.

00:16:55.723 --> 00:16:57.391
Where's Isaza?

00:16:57.433 --> 00:16:59.060
He already left.

00:16:59.101 --> 00:17:02.230
[gasps]
You're lying! He wouldn't!

00:17:02.271 --> 00:17:03.773
[GINKO]
The <i>Koumyaku</i> started shifting

00:17:03.814 --> 00:17:05.233
in the middle of the night.

00:17:05.274 --> 00:17:07.860
It couldn't be helped.

00:17:07.902 --> 00:17:09.862
Isaza left you a message.

00:17:09.904 --> 00:17:12.323
He said, "I'm sorry".

00:17:12.365 --> 00:17:14.158
[gasps]

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.410
[GINKO] They have to
follow the light vein.

00:17:19.163 --> 00:17:21.165
[GINKO] The Watari are
people who were kicked out

00:17:21.207 --> 00:17:23.876
of their villages
because of the <i>mushi.</i>

00:17:25.211 --> 00:17:29.173
If that is your path as well,
then someday, you'll meet again.

00:17:29.215 --> 00:17:31.175
They were kicked out, huh?

00:17:31.217 --> 00:17:33.678
You mean like you were?

00:17:33.719 --> 00:17:36.222
[MUSHI-SHI 2]
Hey, Ginko.

00:17:36.264 --> 00:17:37.515
We're leaving.

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:42.228
[GINKO] I've already
been kicked out again.

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:43.396
Oh.

00:17:43.437 --> 00:17:45.982
He had one more thing
he wanted to tell you.

00:17:47.441 --> 00:17:48.693
He said that the rest of you

00:17:48.734 --> 00:17:51.153
should get away from
this mountain, as well.

00:17:54.282 --> 00:17:56.033
[TAKU]
After that day,

00:17:56.075 --> 00:17:59.328
the mountain's mist never
showed any sign of color.

00:18:05.376 --> 00:18:08.462
[TAKU]
Then, six months later...

00:18:16.596 --> 00:18:18.973
[TAKU]
The mountain spewed fire.

00:18:19.015 --> 00:18:20.558
Those with family
in other places

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.977
abandoned the
village to join them.

00:18:26.272 --> 00:18:28.357
[TAKU]
The mountain burned.

00:18:28.399 --> 00:18:30.401
The waterfall was buried,

00:18:30.443 --> 00:18:33.195
but the basin still
remained as a pond.

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:36.490
[TAKU]
Once, I saw the shadow

00:18:36.532 --> 00:18:39.201
of the large catfish
in its waters.

00:18:39.243 --> 00:18:40.953
But from what I could see,

00:18:40.995 --> 00:18:44.332
the crown of moss it once
had was no longer there.

00:18:48.336 --> 00:18:50.129
[TAKU]
About ten years later,

00:18:50.171 --> 00:18:53.090
we cleared the ash
and planted trees.

00:18:53.132 --> 00:18:56.218
Slowly, the mountain
began to recover.

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:58.971
But it was never as fertile
as it had been before.

00:19:00.306 --> 00:19:02.099
[TAKU] Many of the
children born in the village

00:19:02.141 --> 00:19:04.977
or on the mountain
were weak and frail.

00:19:11.192 --> 00:19:14.445
[TAKU] Isaza and the others knew
that something was coming.

00:19:16.113 --> 00:19:19.700
[TAKU] It probably had something
to do with the light vein.

00:19:19.742 --> 00:19:24.038
Either way, what can
I do to help them?

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:26.499
I don't even know
how to find them.

00:19:29.794 --> 00:19:32.171
[TAKU] Even now, the sound
of footsteps in the grass

00:19:32.213 --> 00:19:34.674
makes me twitch and take notice.

00:19:34.715 --> 00:19:37.718
Always hoping that I'll look
to see that they've returned.

00:19:43.599 --> 00:19:46.060
[TAKU'S WIFE pants]
Taku!

00:19:46.102 --> 00:19:48.729
Taku! There's wonderful news!

00:19:48.771 --> 00:19:50.398
There's a man at
the lower house

00:19:50.439 --> 00:19:53.484
who says he can cure
our children's illness!

00:19:54.652 --> 00:19:55.736
[GINKO]
Now remember,

00:19:55.778 --> 00:19:59.198
prepare the medicine
just like I showed you.

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:02.535
Give it to them once a day
until the illness has passed.

00:20:02.576 --> 00:20:06.122
[gasps]
I don't believe it!

00:20:06.163 --> 00:20:08.874
[TAKU] This mountain used
to be part of the <i>Koumyaku,</i>

00:20:08.916 --> 00:20:12.420
but the light vein shifted
and abandoned this land.

00:20:12.461 --> 00:20:15.423
Many <i>mushi</i> left along with it.

00:20:15.464 --> 00:20:16.507
The ones that remained behind

00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:19.093
seem to gather near
the people here.

00:20:21.387 --> 00:20:25.015
Is that the reason all
of our children are ill?

00:20:25.057 --> 00:20:28.144
Hey. You seem to know
a lot about this stuff.

00:20:28.185 --> 00:20:30.146
Yes, you're exactly right.

00:20:30.187 --> 00:20:33.274
You were born healthy and strong
because of the light vein.

00:20:33.315 --> 00:20:35.359
It was different
for your children.

00:20:35.401 --> 00:20:37.653
The medicine I gave
them not only has vitamins

00:20:37.695 --> 00:20:42.116
and nourishment, but it will
also help keep away the mushi.

00:20:42.158 --> 00:20:43.576
I see.

00:20:45.161 --> 00:20:48.122
Aw, hey, you know what?
I don't think you remember,

00:20:48.164 --> 00:20:51.584
but you and I met once before,
a long time ago.

00:20:51.625 --> 00:20:56.172
We have? When was it?
I don't remember you.

00:20:56.213 --> 00:20:58.674
Do you remember
someone named Isaza?

00:20:58.716 --> 00:21:02.470
I do. why are you a friend
of his or something?

00:21:02.511 --> 00:21:04.346
I still keep in touch with him.

00:21:05.723 --> 00:21:09.477
He's actually the one that
told me about this place.

00:21:09.518 --> 00:21:14.064
He said you'd probably need
something about now. Medicine.

00:21:14.106 --> 00:21:16.567
He's doing the same as usual.

00:21:22.406 --> 00:21:25.659
[TAKU] If that's so,
then it's all right.

00:21:29.038 --> 00:21:31.791
[TAKU]
Everything's fine as it is.

00:21:41.675 --> 00:21:43.302
[GINKO]
Hm?

00:21:43.344 --> 00:21:45.346
A large catfish.

00:21:45.387 --> 00:21:47.723
And the shape of this pond.

00:21:47.765 --> 00:21:49.975
I think I've been here before.

00:21:51.811 --> 00:21:55.815
[GINKO]
Ah... It's him.

00:21:55.856 --> 00:21:59.819
He and the mountain have changed
quite a bit, haven't they?

00:22:01.278 --> 00:22:03.280
[GINKO]
Wouldn't you agree?

00:22:05.491 --> 00:22:07.785
[GINKO]
Mr. Former Master?

00:23:44.131 --> 00:23:48.761
[NARRATOR] This world is
full of life unknown to man.
