[AKI]
On the day of my marriage,

00:01:48.442 --> 00:01:50.694
my wedding party and I
passed through the forest

00:01:50.736 --> 00:01:52.696
north of here.

00:01:52.738 --> 00:01:55.365
I think that must be
where I picked it up.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.120
[AKI]
I didn't see it at first.

00:02:00.162 --> 00:02:03.415
a small green stain
on my headdress.

00:02:03.457 --> 00:02:05.542
My mind was on other things.

00:02:07.127 --> 00:02:10.005
I didn't notice it till
well after the ceremony.

00:02:10.047 --> 00:02:11.298
I didn't like to look at it,

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.592
there was something
repulsive about it.

00:02:15.427 --> 00:02:20.140
The following year, our first
child, Watahiko, was born.

00:02:20.182 --> 00:02:23.560
Please, you must help him.

00:02:23.602 --> 00:02:27.689
Since these spots have appeared,
he's grown weaker and weaker.

00:02:27.731 --> 00:02:30.692
And all I can think of
is that green stain.

00:02:33.904 --> 00:02:38.283
[GINKO] Forgive me,
but I have to ask you.

00:02:38.325 --> 00:02:40.619
Your child, when he was born,

00:02:40.661 --> 00:02:43.497
was he the shape
of a normal baby?

No...

00:02:50.754 --> 00:02:53.548
He wasn't human.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.509
He wasn't even a beast.

00:03:04.976 --> 00:03:08.063
[GINKO] I never thought I'd
be invited back to that house.

Is there still time?

Yes. Hurry, to the house.

Please forgive me.

00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:33.422
I was going to do it.

I really was, but I just ...

It's fine, I understand.

I'm glad that you told me.

00:03:39.052 --> 00:03:40.345
It's strange.

00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:43.515
I really didn't think it would
come to this so quickly.

00:03:43.557 --> 00:03:45.100
[YASUKE]
Yeah...

00:03:45.142 --> 00:03:47.144
He's been growing at
such an incredible rate

00:03:47.185 --> 00:03:48.603
it's frightening.

00:04:00.741 --> 00:04:02.367
I'll tell it from here.

00:04:03.952 --> 00:04:06.163
[YASUKE]
Like she said.

00:04:06.204 --> 00:04:09.040
No, he wasn't human.

00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:11.209

[YASUKE] He didn't
make a cry or a sound.

00:04:21.011 --> 00:04:25.640
He was nothing but a
shapeless green mass.

[YASUKE grunts]

00:04:38.153 --> 00:04:40.322
[YASUKE]
Then it was gone.

00:04:40.363 --> 00:04:43.784
It slipped underneath the
house and disappeared,

00:04:43.825 --> 00:04:46.453
without a trace.

00:04:46.495 --> 00:04:49.748
My wife had wanted
a child so badly,

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.584
but that seemed
impossible now.

00:04:52.626 --> 00:04:56.046
So she spent all her
time shut up in the house

Don't you see?

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.082
He's become human.

I didn't know what to think.

00:05:36.086 --> 00:05:37.879
I was scared,

believe it was so.

That child...

I mean, Watahiko's
growth was amazing.

00:05:47.055 --> 00:05:49.975
He liked to eat
fresh fish and fruit.

00:05:50.016 --> 00:05:52.227
And in a little over six months,

00:05:52.269 --> 00:05:55.605
he was the size of a
three-year-old boy.

00:05:55.647 --> 00:06:00.151
But, his mind remained
that of an infant.

H-He didn't show any
feelings or learn to speak.

Even so, as he grew to
resemble us more and more,

attached too.

just as before.

Why, it's amazing, he looks
exactly like Watahiko!

00:06:40.025 --> 00:06:42.944
I suppose he must
be ours too somehow.

00:06:42.986 --> 00:06:46.323
I wonder. Do you think
there'll be more?

00:06:46.364 --> 00:06:48.867
You shouldn't say
things like that.

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:51.536
[YASUKE]
But there were more.

00:06:51.578 --> 00:06:54.497
Watahiko continued
to multiply.

to be spreading.

there's no hope for him.

00:07:21.816 --> 00:07:26.154
And then, someone told
us about people like you.

[GINKO]
I'm sorry.

00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:32.077
Even a <i>mushi</i> master is

[GINKO] He's reached the
end of his lifespan.

There's a mushi known
as a <i>"watahaki."</i>

00:07:39.501 --> 00:07:42.045
it looks something like
green cotton in appearance

00:07:42.087 --> 00:07:43.380
and floats through the air.

00:07:43.421 --> 00:07:45.131
It enters the body
of a pregnant woman

00:07:45.173 --> 00:07:48.009
and becomes a parasite on
the ovum, destroying it.

00:07:48.051 --> 00:07:49.552
The mother then
gives birth to it

00:07:49.594 --> 00:07:51.429
in the form of a
gelatinous ooze,

00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:54.641
which quickly escapes through
the floors or into the ceiling.

00:07:54.683 --> 00:07:57.769
Six months later, it sends a
fungus in the shape of a baby,

00:07:57.811 --> 00:08:00.563
called a <i>hitotake,</i>
back to the parents.

Your son's rate of growth

00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:05.068

[gasps]

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:34.806
[GINKO]
The <i>hitotake</i> are connected

00:08:34.848 --> 00:08:38.435
to the main mass of the
<i>watahaki</i> by slender filaments.

00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:42.814
[GINKO] They're merely
extensions of the <i>mushi.</i>

00:08:42.856 --> 00:08:45.108
They gather nutrients
for the main body,

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:47.485
like the roots of a plant.

When he does, he'll cough
up a cloud of spores.

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:03.043
Before that happens,
we have to kill him.

00:09:03.084 --> 00:09:03.668

Are you out of your mind?!

Do you think we called you here
so you could murder my baby?

Save him!

00:09:09.132 --> 00:09:10.467

There's no child left
for me to save.

00:09:16.431 --> 00:09:18.475
Those children are
actually <i>mushi</i>

00:09:18.516 --> 00:09:22.687
wearing the skin of your
child as a disguise.

What's more,

00:09:24.064 --> 00:09:27.609
it was they who killed your
unborn child in the womb,

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:29.861
in order to take its place.

00:09:31.112 --> 00:09:33.948
[GINKO]
Please, try to understand.

00:09:41.289 --> 00:09:42.874
[GINKO]
I'm sorry.

00:09:42.916 --> 00:09:45.710
It's all right... to hate me.

00:09:55.678 --> 00:09:58.890
[sighs] I'm surprised you
persuaded your wife.

00:10:00.141 --> 00:10:03.978
Me, too. And she hasn't
spoken to me since then.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:06.940
We cared for him as our
own son for three years.

00:10:06.981 --> 00:10:08.399
who can blame her?

00:10:10.068 --> 00:10:10.652
Listen.

00:10:10.693 --> 00:10:13.446
She... She wants you to leave
the other children with us.

00:10:13.488 --> 00:10:14.447
Please!

00:10:14.489 --> 00:10:16.116
I want you to as well!

00:10:16.157 --> 00:10:17.659
A-At least for now!

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.994
They're harmless until they
start to have symptoms!

00:10:20.036 --> 00:10:22.413
I beg you, leave them alone!

00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:25.834
I'll take care of them.
You don't have to worry.

00:10:25.875 --> 00:10:27.293
When the time comes,

00:10:27.335 --> 00:10:30.880
I'll kill the next two before
they leave any spores.

00:10:30.922 --> 00:10:33.383
Just leave them with us!

00:10:33.424 --> 00:10:35.093
But the lifespan of a <i>watahaki</i>

00:10:35.135 --> 00:10:38.096
can be anywhere from
10 to 30 years long.

00:10:38.138 --> 00:10:41.349
And during that time,
the cycle will repeat itself.

00:10:41.391 --> 00:10:43.101
Do you see what I'm saying?

00:10:43.143 --> 00:10:44.811
You don't know how many
more of these "children"

00:10:44.853 --> 00:10:47.188
you may have to kill.

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:48.815
Can you do this it?

00:10:48.857 --> 00:10:50.233
I can.

00:10:50.275 --> 00:10:51.901
I swear to you.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:56.406
Tell me something.

00:10:56.447 --> 00:10:59.492
You said before you
were afraid of them.

00:10:59.534 --> 00:11:03.538
So why do you say now
you want to raise them?

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:04.914
Because...

00:11:04.956 --> 00:11:08.459
...I don't want my wife to
suffer any more than she has.

00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:11.296
Aki... adores those
four children.

00:11:11.337 --> 00:11:14.340
She calls them all Watahiko.

00:11:14.382 --> 00:11:17.552
If we lose all of them at once,

00:11:17.594 --> 00:11:20.638
I don't know what
would happen to her.

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.182
Many years ago,

00:11:22.223 --> 00:11:25.018
she married into the family
of a wealthy shopkeeper

00:11:25.059 --> 00:11:28.521
from a town
beyond the mountains.

00:11:28.563 --> 00:11:32.442
She gave birth to the expected
heir and all was well.

00:11:32.483 --> 00:11:36.029
But before the boy
was even a year old,

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:39.199
he died of some minor illness.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:42.535
So her first husband
divorced her.

00:11:42.577 --> 00:11:47.207
It isn't... it isn't fair.
It's just... cruel.

00:11:48.208 --> 00:11:50.460
[exhales]

00:11:50.501 --> 00:11:53.796
In the past, as soon
as they were identified,

00:11:53.838 --> 00:11:57.091
All <i>watahaki</i> children
were killed.

00:11:57.133 --> 00:12:00.929
And as a result,
the main body died off.

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:03.640
There's no record of more
than two children surviving.

00:12:03.681 --> 00:12:06.434
At least, not until now.

00:12:06.476 --> 00:12:07.310
Who knows?

00:12:07.352 --> 00:12:10.647
These children may never
develop the expected symptoms.

00:12:10.688 --> 00:12:11.856
Then, we can--

00:12:11.898 --> 00:12:14.150
[GINKO]
Maybe.

00:12:14.192 --> 00:12:15.902
It's hard to say.

[gasps]

00:12:17.987 --> 00:12:20.198
But it'd be hasty
to kill the others.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:23.534
Besides, I just
don't want to do it.

00:12:23.576 --> 00:12:26.496
I have reasons I can't
stay here any longer,

months to check in on you.

My wife has agreed.

We're raising
something unnatural.

You're awake!

[groans]

[GINKO]
What a life...

00:14:05.136 --> 00:14:08.181
[YASUKE] There's no way I can
tell you how sorry I am.

00:14:08.222 --> 00:14:10.683
I'll, uh... I'll keep her
locked in our bedroom

00:14:10.725 --> 00:14:13.186
until you're finished here.

00:14:13.227 --> 00:14:15.688
Uh-huh... you do that.

00:14:17.315 --> 00:14:19.275
I thought she understood.

00:14:19.317 --> 00:14:21.027
I was a fool.

00:14:23.237 --> 00:14:24.489
So I gather...

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:27.825
...the situation here has
changed since last time?

00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:32.455
Yes, I... I... was going to
tell you before, but then...

00:14:32.497 --> 00:14:34.999
...the children. They're not...

00:14:35.041 --> 00:14:37.960
...they're not just developing
physically anymore.

00:14:38.002 --> 00:14:39.128
For instance,

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:42.173
one time I saw my fourth
son peeling chestnuts

00:14:42.215 --> 00:14:44.926
just as I had taught
my second son.

00:14:44.967 --> 00:14:48.179
I had only recently taught
the older boy this.

00:14:48.221 --> 00:14:51.015
Did the younger
learn by copying?

00:14:51.057 --> 00:14:54.769
They seem to be gradually
getting smarter.

00:14:54.811 --> 00:14:56.020
Ah... Ah...

00:14:56.062 --> 00:14:58.439
Oh, dear. Did you get
caught out in the rain?

00:14:58.481 --> 00:15:01.067
I'll get you a change
of clothes, all right?

00:15:02.443 --> 00:15:04.320
[WATAHIKO]
Daddy?

00:15:04.362 --> 00:15:05.530
[YASUKE]
Huh?

00:15:05.571 --> 00:15:08.825
Daddy. I'm hungry.

00:15:08.866 --> 00:15:12.203
Aki! He talked. He talked!

00:15:12.245 --> 00:15:14.288
Well, all right then,
little man!

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:17.083
Let's get you something to eat!

00:15:17.125 --> 00:15:18.543
[YASUKE]
But then our second son

00:15:18.584 --> 00:15:21.712
developed the same
symptoms as the first.

00:15:23.881 --> 00:15:26.175
[AKI]
It's too soon.

00:15:26.217 --> 00:15:28.428
We just lost his
older brother.

00:15:28.469 --> 00:15:30.388
We can't lose him too.

00:15:31.973 --> 00:15:33.558
We have to.

00:15:33.599 --> 00:15:34.976
We promised.

00:15:35.017 --> 00:15:36.978
It's our duty to kill him.

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:41.649
[WATAHIKO]
Daddy? I don't want to die.

00:15:41.691 --> 00:15:42.775
[gasps]

00:15:42.817 --> 00:15:44.485
Please don't kill me.

00:15:44.527 --> 00:15:46.654
I wanna live.

00:15:46.696 --> 00:15:49.532
Save me, Daddy.

00:15:49.574 --> 00:15:51.659
[gasps]

00:15:51.701 --> 00:15:55.163
[YASUKE] He's become too
much like a real person.

00:15:55.204 --> 00:15:57.123
I can't do it.

00:15:57.165 --> 00:15:59.542
Not even to take revenge...

00:15:59.584 --> 00:16:01.752
...for the death
of our real baby.

00:16:01.794 --> 00:16:03.713
[GINKO]
How is this possible?

00:16:03.754 --> 00:16:06.799
It's suddenly learned
how to think?

00:16:06.841 --> 00:16:07.967
No...

00:16:08.009 --> 00:16:10.511
It must have always
been able to.

00:16:10.553 --> 00:16:13.473
Perhaps it sensed danger
when the oldest died,

00:16:13.514 --> 00:16:16.309
and that triggered
this new behavior.

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:21.898
And anything one learns,
is transmitted to all of them.

00:16:21.939 --> 00:16:26.944
Each of them is connected to
the main body of the <i>mushi...</i>

00:16:26.986 --> 00:16:30.865
They all receive information
for five people at once.

00:16:30.907 --> 00:16:33.284
That's how they
learn so quickly.

00:16:33.326 --> 00:16:37.747
But, are they human in any way?

00:16:37.788 --> 00:16:39.415
No...

00:16:39.457 --> 00:16:40.917
They're a fungus...

00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:42.877
...in human form.

00:16:42.919 --> 00:16:44.670
That thinks.

00:16:46.631 --> 00:16:51.052
[WATAHIKO] We've failed.
We're going to be killed.

00:16:51.093 --> 00:16:54.138
We're going to be killed.

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:57.141
We have to protect the spores.

00:16:57.183 --> 00:16:59.644
I'm sure there was a way.

00:16:59.685 --> 00:17:01.479
We've forgotten...

00:17:01.521 --> 00:17:03.439
We've forgotten!

00:17:03.481 --> 00:17:05.441
When we learned human things,

00:17:05.483 --> 00:17:09.111
we lost our memory of
how to protect the spores.

00:17:09.153 --> 00:17:11.948
What was it?

00:17:11.989 --> 00:17:13.991
What was it?!

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.610
I'm going to kill the base.

And I'm sorry,

00:17:50.861 --> 00:17:54.282
but I'm going to have to take
the remaining children with me.

00:17:54.323 --> 00:17:56.909
I can't leave them
with you any longer.

this without having to think.

00:19:57.655 --> 00:19:59.407
[gasps]

00:20:02.326 --> 00:20:04.745
[BOTH gasping]

00:20:07.832 --> 00:20:10.251
[AKI]
Watahiko...

00:20:10.292 --> 00:20:12.128
My baby...

00:20:25.725 --> 00:20:28.519
[GINKO] The base has
completely disappeared.

00:20:32.732 --> 00:20:33.733
[gasp]

00:20:34.942 --> 00:20:37.069
[GINKO] When the <i>watahaki</i>
is threatened,

00:20:37.111 --> 00:20:39.780
it releases the
<i>hitotake</i> from the base.

00:20:39.822 --> 00:20:42.867
That way, the spores
can escape.

00:20:42.908 --> 00:20:45.661
The <i>hitotake</i> then
change their form

00:20:45.703 --> 00:20:48.330
and go into a long hibernation.

00:20:53.627 --> 00:20:56.338
This... this is?

00:20:57.673 --> 00:21:01.177
I have no idea when
they'll awaken.

00:21:01.218 --> 00:21:04.388
It could be long after
you pass away.

00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:05.806
In any event,

00:21:05.848 --> 00:21:08.017
until that time comes,

00:21:08.058 --> 00:21:10.227
I'll leave it with
the two of you.

00:21:10.269 --> 00:21:11.562
[AKI sobs]

00:21:11.604 --> 00:21:13.898
I understand.

00:21:13.939 --> 00:21:16.525
We'll care for it always.

00:21:16.567 --> 00:21:21.572
[sobing continues]

00:21:27.703 --> 00:21:29.747
[WATAHIKO] What was that
thing you gave them?

00:21:29.789 --> 00:21:31.373
[GINKO]
A chunk of mineral.

00:21:31.415 --> 00:21:33.709
It was part of my supplies.

00:21:33.751 --> 00:21:36.462
Rather pricey, too.

00:21:36.504 --> 00:21:39.381
[WATAHIKO]
Why did you do that?

00:21:39.423 --> 00:21:41.926
You sure are an odd creature.

00:21:41.967 --> 00:21:43.719
Look who's talking.

00:21:45.846 --> 00:21:47.848
[GINKO]
Why aren't you hibernating?

00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:51.435
All the records say that's what
you should be doing now.

00:21:51.477 --> 00:21:54.230
Because... I'm not sleepy.

00:21:54.271 --> 00:21:56.649
What about you?

00:21:56.690 --> 00:22:01.445
Why don't you kill me now, while
you have me here helpless?

00:22:01.487 --> 00:22:04.031
Because I've got till
the end of my life.

00:22:05.658 --> 00:22:08.369
[WATAHIKO]
Like I said, an odd creature.

00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:12.164
[GINKO] That's enough out
of you. Go to sleep already.

00:23:48.761 --> 00:23:51.764
[NARRATOR]
Next: "Shrine in the Sea."
