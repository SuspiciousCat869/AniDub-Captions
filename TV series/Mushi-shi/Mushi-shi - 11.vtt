That's odd.

There's a hole in the mountain.

Ah!

I see now why the locals
consider this mountain sacred.

We've tried that already.

[VILLAGER 1]
It would seem unwise.

00:02:30.776 --> 00:02:32.569
This time of year especially.

00:02:32.611 --> 00:02:35.447
Mujika himself warned us of
the dangers, did he not?

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.785
Yes. All the more reason
to worry about his safety.

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:41.161
So What's the problem?

00:02:41.203 --> 00:02:43.330

A <i>mushi</i> master.

I noticed something odd
about the mountain earlier.

I thought, perhaps, you might
be in need of my services.

[VILLAGE ELDER]
Very well...

00:03:04.476 --> 00:03:07.312
Sir, if you are indeed
a <i>mushi</i> master,

00:03:07.354 --> 00:03:10.023
we have a favor to ask of you.

00:03:10.065 --> 00:03:11.900
We would like you
to locate someone.

00:03:11.942 --> 00:03:14.236
Another <i>mushi</i> master,
named Mujika,

00:03:14.277 --> 00:03:16.279
who lives on the mountain.

00:03:18.907 --> 00:03:20.992
There is a god who
dwells in the mountain,

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:24.996
who has protected our
people for generations.

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:29.167
Mujika is the only person able
to interpret the god's wishes.

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.002
He shares this
knowledge with us,

00:03:31.044 --> 00:03:34.047
often returning to our
village with instructions,

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:37.300
which we have always followed,
to our great benefit.

00:03:37.342 --> 00:03:40.846
One of his instructions strictly
forbids us from traveling deep

00:03:40.887 --> 00:03:43.348
into the mountain
during harvest season.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.102
However, when Mujika ceased to
appear on his regular visits,

00:03:47.144 --> 00:03:50.313
we felt it necessary
to violate this taboo.

00:03:50.355 --> 00:03:51.773
Fearing for his safety,

00:03:51.815 --> 00:03:55.026
a group of men set out
in an effort to find him.

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:57.696
Unfortunately, this effort
was in vain.

00:03:57.738 --> 00:03:59.698
The men returned from
the mountain suffering

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.283
from a mysterious illness.

00:04:01.324 --> 00:04:06.538
A consuming fever, from which,
sadly, they did not recover.

00:04:08.498 --> 00:04:12.461
[huffs]
There's a strange energy here.

00:04:12.502 --> 00:04:14.171
The air is thick with it.

00:04:14.212 --> 00:04:18.592
Sweet, bitter... A scent
that sticks to your skin.

00:04:18.633 --> 00:04:21.762
This place... is a
light pulse vein.

00:04:24.848 --> 00:04:27.809
[GINKO] The river of light flows
strong through these woods.

00:04:27.851 --> 00:04:29.978
On top of that,
it's harvest season.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.439
The life force here
is at its peak.

00:04:32.481 --> 00:04:35.317
If a person were to wander up
the mountain unprepared,

00:04:35.358 --> 00:04:38.445
I can see how they might
easily be overwhelmed by it.

00:04:39.738 --> 00:04:41.698
[GINKO] Since this is
a light pulse vein,

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.909
there should be a
god in control here.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.077
But if all is not
well with the god,

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:49.331
that could explain
any unusual phenomena.

A <i>mugura</i> bond.

the "nerves" of the mountain.

I managed to sustain myself

on the shrubs and vines nearby.

00:07:35.538 --> 00:07:39.209
Fortunately, my bottle
was full when I set out.

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.002
The villagers must
be anxious to know

the mountain god's thoughts.

00:07:42.712 --> 00:07:46.299
It would seem my carelessness
has caused them undue worry.

00:07:46.341 --> 00:07:49.219
Especially, seeing as...

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:53.264
...they sent a fellow

I'm Mujika.

00:07:56.393 --> 00:07:59.813
And I'm in your debt,
though a bit embarrassed.

00:08:00.981 --> 00:08:02.649
This mountain is my home.

00:08:02.691 --> 00:08:04.401
In my youth, I could
have made my way

00:08:04.442 --> 00:08:06.319
from base to
summit blindfolded.

00:08:06.361 --> 00:08:09.322
But now, to have fallen
from such a familiar path...

00:08:09.364 --> 00:08:12.367
I fear my age is
catching up to me.

00:08:12.409 --> 00:08:14.536
It saddens me to say, but,

00:08:14.577 --> 00:08:18.164
perhaps the time has come
to relinquish my duties.

00:08:18.206 --> 00:08:21.584
[GINKO] By which
you mean... "god duties".

00:08:22.585 --> 00:08:24.004
[GINKO] The only one
who could have broken

00:08:24.045 --> 00:08:26.756
my bond with the
<i>mugura mushi</i> is either

00:08:26.798 --> 00:08:28.717
the true god of the mountain,

00:08:28.758 --> 00:08:31.428
or a person with
the powers of a god.

00:08:31.469 --> 00:08:34.222
My guess is, the unusual
happenings on the mountain

00:08:34.264 --> 00:08:36.474
recently are due to the
fact that your injury

00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:39.519
has prevented you from
fully utilizing those powers.

00:08:39.561 --> 00:08:40.854
[MUJIKA]
Correct.

00:08:40.895 --> 00:08:42.522
Though, thanks to you,

00:08:42.564 --> 00:08:45.483
I should be able to resume
my duties as of tomorrow,

00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:47.068
in spite of my leg.

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:48.611
You can tell the villagers

00:08:48.653 --> 00:08:51.156
the mountain will soon
return to normal.

00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:55.618
Still. For a human to
assume the role of a god...

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:58.079
How did this come about?

00:08:58.121 --> 00:09:00.331
I'm sure you've
realized by now,

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:03.209
this is no ordinary mountain.

00:09:03.251 --> 00:09:06.254
It is, of course, a <i>mushi</i>
light pulse vein.

00:09:06.296 --> 00:09:08.006
There was once a
rightful god here,

00:09:08.048 --> 00:09:10.592
suppressing the
mountain's energy.

00:09:10.633 --> 00:09:13.511
Unfortunately, there was
a terrible accident.

00:09:13.553 --> 00:09:16.681
A villager killed
the god by mistake.

00:09:16.723 --> 00:09:18.892
Soon after,
the waters of the river

00:09:18.933 --> 00:09:21.311
began to smell of rice wine

00:09:21.352 --> 00:09:25.607
and the vegetation began
to over-ripen and rot.

00:09:25.648 --> 00:09:28.651
I, too, was a traveling
<i>mushi</i> master in those days,

00:09:28.693 --> 00:09:32.030
my wanderings frequently
leading me through these parts.

00:09:32.072 --> 00:09:34.199
When I learned of the
villagers' misfortune,

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.994
I took it upon myself to assume
the role of the mountain god.

00:09:38.036 --> 00:09:40.288
My wife and I settled here.

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.957
Sadly, she died soon after.

00:09:42.999 --> 00:09:45.710
The energy of this place
was simply too much for her.

00:09:45.752 --> 00:09:48.838
[GINKO] So, you're training this
boy to be the next mountain god?

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.673
[MUJIKA]
Yes. That's right.

00:09:50.715 --> 00:09:52.675
[GINKO] His knowledge of the
mountain was impressive,

00:09:52.717 --> 00:09:54.344
for someone his age.

00:09:54.385 --> 00:09:56.596
[MUJIKA]
Yes, well...

00:09:56.638 --> 00:09:58.431
...he is a child
of the mountain.

00:09:58.473 --> 00:10:01.768
He's walked this terrain
since he took his first steps.

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:02.393
[GINKO]
Hm?

00:10:02.435 --> 00:10:04.062
[MUJIKA] Did you notice
the number of children

00:10:04.104 --> 00:10:05.021
in the village?

00:10:05.063 --> 00:10:08.441
The water that flows from this
mountain has curious properties.

00:10:08.483 --> 00:10:09.234
Once of which,

00:10:09.275 --> 00:10:12.153
it causes the women
to be especially fertile.

00:10:12.195 --> 00:10:14.364
They can't afford to raise
all of the children,

00:10:14.405 --> 00:10:17.367
so some are abandoned here
on the mountainside.

00:10:17.408 --> 00:10:20.745
Of those, this boy is the
only one who survived.

00:10:20.787 --> 00:10:23.665
The others falling
prey to wild beasts.

00:10:23.706 --> 00:10:26.709
Sadly, his brothers and sisters
who remained in the village

00:10:26.751 --> 00:10:29.254
were claimed by illness
at an early age.

00:10:29.295 --> 00:10:32.006
When his parents learned that
their son was still alive,

00:10:32.048 --> 00:10:34.092
they insisted on
taking him home.

00:10:34.134 --> 00:10:37.303
That was a year ago.

00:10:37.345 --> 00:10:39.180
[GINKO]
Seems rather selfish.

00:10:39.222 --> 00:10:39.889
[MUJIKA]
Perhaps.

00:10:39.931 --> 00:10:42.475
But their feelings
are understandable.

00:10:42.517 --> 00:10:46.354
And I believe in the end,
it's for the best.

00:10:46.396 --> 00:10:49.983
[bell chimes]

00:10:50.024 --> 00:10:52.152
[GINKO]
That bell again...

00:10:52.193 --> 00:10:53.778
This late at night?

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:55.780
[MUJIKA]
So, tell me.

00:10:55.822 --> 00:10:57.699
Do you have a place
you call home?

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:01.035
Honestly, you strike me as
more the wandering type.

00:11:01.077 --> 00:11:05.039
That's right. You see,
I have a tendency...

00:11:05.081 --> 00:11:07.750
...to attract <i>mushi.</i>

00:11:07.792 --> 00:11:11.713
I can't stay too long in any one
place or it becomes infested.

00:11:11.754 --> 00:11:13.756
You can imagine,
I began honing my

00:11:13.798 --> 00:11:16.134
<i>mushi</i> exterminating
skills out of necessity.

00:11:16.176 --> 00:11:18.678
[MUJIKA] So you have no
choice but to follow the winds,

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.430
wherever they may take you.

00:11:20.471 --> 00:11:21.389
True.

00:11:21.431 --> 00:11:24.809
But as you say, the wandering
life seems to suit me.

00:11:24.851 --> 00:11:26.603
Yes, well...

00:11:26.644 --> 00:11:29.355
As a man who will never again
leave the shadow

00:11:29.397 --> 00:11:30.940
of this mountain,

00:11:30.982 --> 00:11:33.943
I must confess,
I'm a bit jealous.

00:11:33.985 --> 00:11:36.863
But my wandering
days are long over.

00:11:36.905 --> 00:11:38.364
For better or for worse,

00:11:38.406 --> 00:11:42.535
this mountain will be the final
resting place for my bones.

00:11:50.168 --> 00:11:52.378
[KODAMA] All right, then.
I'll go back to the village

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:54.464
and let the others
know what's going on.

00:11:54.505 --> 00:11:56.299
But be careful while I'm gone.

00:11:56.341 --> 00:11:58.301
Don't strain yourself.

00:11:58.343 --> 00:12:00.053
I'll be fine.

00:12:00.094 --> 00:12:02.055
As for you, don't come
back to the mountain

00:12:02.096 --> 00:12:04.599
until the harvest
season has passed.

00:12:04.641 --> 00:12:07.477
[MUJIKA chuckles]
Well, sir...

00:12:07.518 --> 00:12:09.646
I wish you well in your travels.

00:12:09.687 --> 00:12:11.689
Thanks. Take care.

00:12:20.406 --> 00:12:22.700
[KODAMA]
Say, uh...

00:12:22.742 --> 00:12:25.703
I-I'm still
your apprentice, right?

00:12:26.621 --> 00:12:27.997
[MUJIKA]
Of course.

00:12:28.039 --> 00:12:29.415
Your journey here
from the village

00:12:29.457 --> 00:12:32.293
has proven to be valuable
training, has it not?

00:12:32.335 --> 00:12:36.923
At this rate, you're going to be
a great <i>mushi</i> master one day.

00:12:36.965 --> 00:12:38.174
[KODAMA]
Mm.

00:12:40.677 --> 00:12:44.055
[VILLAGER 5]
Hey! It's the <i>mushi</i> master!

00:12:44.097 --> 00:12:45.682
And Kodama is with him!

00:12:45.723 --> 00:12:48.351
They found Mujika! He's safe!

00:12:52.313 --> 00:12:55.775
[VILLAGERS snoring]

00:12:55.817 --> 00:12:58.319
[bell chimes]

00:12:58.361 --> 00:12:59.362
[gasps]

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:06.202
[GINKO] It seems to
be getting closer.

00:13:06.244 --> 00:13:08.496
And not just because
of the wind.

00:13:08.538 --> 00:13:10.331
It's something else.

00:13:10.373 --> 00:13:12.458
[KODAMA]
Ginko!

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:13.960
I heard it again!

00:13:14.002 --> 00:13:16.963
But, there are no bells
like that near the village.

00:13:17.005 --> 00:13:21.551
And my parents. They say
they can't hear anything!

00:13:21.592 --> 00:13:25.138
I think it might be
some kind of <i>mushi.</i>

00:13:25.179 --> 00:13:27.140
[GINKO]
Let me ask you something.

00:13:27.181 --> 00:13:29.017
[KODAMA]
Huh?

00:13:29.058 --> 00:13:30.310
[GINKO]
Mujika.

00:13:30.351 --> 00:13:34.439
Has he taught you how to become
the next mountain god yet?

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.691
The what?

00:13:36.733 --> 00:13:40.069
The techniques for
performing the god's duties.

00:13:40.111 --> 00:13:42.572
You maintain a constant
bond with the <i>mugura,</i>

00:13:42.613 --> 00:13:45.241
keeping them inside
your body at all times.

00:13:45.283 --> 00:13:48.328
Thus, if the <i>mugura</i> are like
the nerves of the mountain,

00:13:48.369 --> 00:13:50.538
you effectively
become the brain.

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:52.165
Even when you're sleeping,

00:13:52.206 --> 00:13:54.751
you're aware of
every tree, every rock.

00:13:54.792 --> 00:13:56.002
And with practice,

00:13:56.044 --> 00:13:58.588
it's possible to use your
control of the <i>mugura</i>

00:13:58.629 --> 00:14:01.758
to control the
mountain's energy as well.

00:14:01.799 --> 00:14:04.469
No, I... I haven't
learned that yet.

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:07.055
I see.

00:14:07.096 --> 00:14:09.640
Well... anyway, you're right.

00:14:09.682 --> 00:14:11.768
That bell sound is a <i>mushi.</i>

00:14:11.809 --> 00:14:13.269
It's harmless, though.

00:14:13.311 --> 00:14:15.313
You should go home
and get some sleep.

00:14:15.355 --> 00:14:16.981
[KODAMA]
But, where are you going?

00:14:17.023 --> 00:14:19.776
[GINKO] I was just stepping
out for some night air.

00:14:19.817 --> 00:14:21.027
That's all.

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:31.079
[GINKO]
It's quiet.

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.581
The whole mountain's gone still.

00:14:33.623 --> 00:14:36.042
It must be getting
really close now.

00:14:36.084 --> 00:14:37.502
Crazy old man.

00:14:37.543 --> 00:14:39.879
He's insane to call it here.

00:14:42.382 --> 00:14:45.385
[panting]

00:14:51.057 --> 00:14:52.600
[GINKO]
Where is he?

00:14:52.642 --> 00:14:54.977
[bell chimes]

00:14:55.019 --> 00:14:57.355
[GINKO]
Wait, that sounded like it's--

00:14:57.397 --> 00:14:59.607
It's coming from the summit!

00:15:07.949 --> 00:15:10.743
[pants]

00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:13.955
You...

00:15:13.996 --> 00:15:16.958
Is something wrong?
You seem troubled.

00:15:16.999 --> 00:15:20.378
Your leg. It was never
really injured, was it?

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:22.088
You were hiding at the
bottom of that cliff

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:26.092
so you wouldn't be interrupted
while you summoned a <i>kuchinawa.</i>

00:15:26.134 --> 00:15:28.428
[MUJIKA]
I don't know what you mean.

00:15:28.469 --> 00:15:29.971
[GINKO]
The hell you don't.

00:15:30.012 --> 00:15:32.765
That bell sound that's
been getting closer.

00:15:32.807 --> 00:15:35.184
That's the cry of a <i>kuchinawa.</i>

00:15:35.226 --> 00:15:37.562
And you know what it wants.

00:15:37.603 --> 00:15:39.480
It's a <i>mushi</i> predator.

00:15:39.522 --> 00:15:41.023
And it feeds on gods.

00:15:41.065 --> 00:15:42.608
Mountain gods, swamp gods,

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:45.236
it devours them so it
can take their place.

00:15:47.738 --> 00:15:49.198
But it is also a <i>mushi</i>

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:53.244
which will bring
stability to this place.

00:15:53.286 --> 00:15:55.621
Please don't interfere.

00:15:55.663 --> 00:15:59.083
The time has come
to pay my debt.

00:15:59.125 --> 00:16:01.419
The original god
of this mountain

00:16:01.461 --> 00:16:03.504
was a magnificent creature.

00:16:03.546 --> 00:16:06.257
It had taken the
shape of a giant boar.

00:16:06.299 --> 00:16:08.634
Ancient and proud.

00:16:09.927 --> 00:16:13.681
Its death was because of me.

00:16:13.723 --> 00:16:17.059
I should have never
uttered my thoughts aloud.

00:16:17.101 --> 00:16:17.810
I should have realized--

00:16:17.852 --> 00:16:18.895
[GINKO]
Save the details for later.

00:16:18.936 --> 00:16:20.897
We need to get you
off this mountain!

00:16:20.938 --> 00:16:22.565
[MUJIKA]
It's too late.

00:16:22.607 --> 00:16:25.401
The <i>kuchinawa</i> has
already found me.

00:16:25.443 --> 00:16:26.986
The role of the mountain god

00:16:27.028 --> 00:16:30.198
is best filled by a creature
like the <i>kuchinawa.</i>

00:16:30.239 --> 00:16:32.492
It's too difficult
for a human.

00:16:32.533 --> 00:16:34.660
The skills I taught Kodama

00:16:34.702 --> 00:16:38.706
are merely those he'll need
to survive in this world.

00:16:38.748 --> 00:16:39.832
What are you doing?!

00:16:39.874 --> 00:16:42.043
[GINKO] I'm releasing
the <i>mugura</i> from your body.

00:16:42.084 --> 00:16:43.252
[MUJIKA]
To what end?

00:16:43.294 --> 00:16:44.462
It won't do any good.

00:16:44.504 --> 00:16:47.381
Believe me, this is the only
way to set things right.

00:16:47.423 --> 00:16:50.635
You don't know that.
You still have a choice!

00:16:50.676 --> 00:16:53.262
If not for yourself,
then for Kodoma.

00:16:54.514 --> 00:16:56.641
[GINKO]
You're like a father to him.

00:16:56.682 --> 00:16:59.060
He looks up to you.
He needs you.

00:16:59.101 --> 00:17:00.186
You said once before

00:17:00.228 --> 00:17:02.730
that you were a little
bit jealous of me.

00:17:02.772 --> 00:17:05.900
The truth is, I was
jealous of you, too.

00:17:05.942 --> 00:17:07.568
And I'm not going
to just stand here

00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:08.986
and let you throw
your life away!

00:17:09.028 --> 00:17:10.279
Not like this!

00:17:10.321 --> 00:17:14.742
Ginko! No! You'll only
put yourself in danger!

00:17:14.784 --> 00:17:17.537
[bell chimes]

00:17:29.382 --> 00:17:31.676
[KODAMA]
What is that?

00:17:31.717 --> 00:17:33.469
Mujika!

00:17:33.511 --> 00:17:35.388
Mujika...!

00:17:51.612 --> 00:17:56.158
[VILLAGER 1] Hey! Everyone!
Come quick! It's Mujika!

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:56.742
[VILLAGER chatter]

00:17:56.784 --> 00:17:57.910
You're back!

00:17:57.952 --> 00:17:59.495
Saku!

00:17:59.537 --> 00:18:01.122
It's good to see you.

00:18:01.163 --> 00:18:02.707
Yes...

00:18:04.917 --> 00:18:06.210
And all of you.

00:18:06.252 --> 00:18:07.962
How are things on the mountain?

00:18:08.004 --> 00:18:10.381
[VILLAGER 2] Actually, there
have been some strange things

00:18:10.423 --> 00:18:12.133
happening since
your last visit.

00:18:12.174 --> 00:18:14.218
We're definitely glad
that you're here.

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.846
[VILLAGER laugh]

00:18:16.887 --> 00:18:18.723
[SAKU'S BROTHER]
Listen Mujika, I was thinking.

00:18:18.764 --> 00:18:20.474
Why don't you come live with us?

00:18:20.516 --> 00:18:22.143
You know, here in the village.

00:18:22.184 --> 00:18:24.645
It'd sure be a great
help having you around.

00:18:24.687 --> 00:18:25.813
[MUJIKA]
I'm sorry.

00:18:25.855 --> 00:18:28.649
I wish I could, but I can't.

00:18:28.691 --> 00:18:30.276
[SAKU'S BROTHER]
Why can't you?

00:18:30.318 --> 00:18:33.779
It seems I have a tendency
to attract <i>mushi.</i>

00:18:33.821 --> 00:18:36.490
I can't stay too
long in one place.

00:18:36.532 --> 00:18:39.744
If I do, it becomes infested.

00:18:39.785 --> 00:18:41.037
[SAKU'S BROTHER]
Are you sure?

00:18:41.078 --> 00:18:43.039
There must be some way...

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.625
Saku, my younger sister,

00:18:45.666 --> 00:18:48.544
she's been waiting all this
time for you to come back.

00:18:48.586 --> 00:18:50.755
The two of you could
settle down together.

00:18:50.796 --> 00:18:52.256
Make a home.

00:18:54.342 --> 00:18:56.552
[MUJIKA] There is only one way
that it might be possible

00:18:56.594 --> 00:18:58.512
for me to live here.

00:18:58.554 --> 00:19:01.098
If I killed the
mountain god.

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:03.059
If I killed it and
ate of its flesh,

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:04.935
I could take its place.

00:19:06.646 --> 00:19:09.023
[MUJIKA] Then, I could keep the
<i>mushi</i> away from the mountain

00:19:09.065 --> 00:19:10.566
with my mind.

00:19:13.569 --> 00:19:16.656
[MUJIKA]
I'm sorry. I want to stay.

00:19:16.697 --> 00:19:20.201
But... it's simply
not realistic.

00:19:27.208 --> 00:19:30.670
[MUJIKA] My poison.
My map of the god's pathway.

00:19:30.711 --> 00:19:32.254
They're gone.

00:19:32.296 --> 00:19:34.423
Did I misplace them somehow?

00:19:37.343 --> 00:19:38.511
[MUJIKA]
Saku!

00:19:38.552 --> 00:19:40.054
Where have you been?

00:19:40.096 --> 00:19:43.099
I was... catching dinner.

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:46.644
I brought you some
fresh boar meat.

00:19:46.686 --> 00:19:48.229
[MUJIKA gasps]

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:49.563
[SAKU]
If you're hungry,

00:19:49.605 --> 00:19:52.608
I'll start preparing
it right away.

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:55.069
Just wait here, all right?

00:19:55.111 --> 00:19:58.698
It will be worth it. I promise.

00:19:58.739 --> 00:20:01.033
[MUJIKA]
S-Saku...

00:20:01.075 --> 00:20:03.327
[SAKU]
Please...

00:20:03.369 --> 00:20:07.206
Please... just tell
me you'll stay...

00:20:07.248 --> 00:20:08.999
...forever.

00:20:12.628 --> 00:20:15.881
[GINKO]
Before I awoke, I saw a vision.

00:20:15.923 --> 00:20:18.342
A memory that was not my own.

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:34.233
When I made it to the summit,
I found you unconscious, but...

00:20:34.275 --> 00:20:36.152
...there was no
sign of Mujika anywhere.

00:20:38.154 --> 00:20:40.364
I searched everyplace
I could think to look,

00:20:40.406 --> 00:20:42.742
but I still couldn't find him.

00:20:42.783 --> 00:20:47.788
And when I went back to his
cottage, it was gone too.

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:50.374
The strangest part is,
it seems like none of the

00:20:50.416 --> 00:20:53.669
villagers even remember
who Mujika was...

00:20:55.296 --> 00:20:57.923
That's because he's
been replaced.

00:20:57.965 --> 00:21:02.261
When the <i>kuchinawa</i> devours
a god, they do so completely.

00:21:02.303 --> 00:21:05.097
As for us, because we were
on the mountain at the time,

00:21:05.139 --> 00:21:08.100
our memories are still intact.

00:21:08.142 --> 00:21:11.854
Ah. You've already set
out <i>mushi</i> repellent.

00:21:11.896 --> 00:21:14.523
You prepared this by yourself?

00:21:14.565 --> 00:21:16.567
[KODAMA]
Yeah...

00:21:16.609 --> 00:21:19.612
[GINKO]
Well done. I'm impressed.

00:21:19.653 --> 00:21:21.530
You remember, right?

00:21:21.572 --> 00:21:23.991
I was Mujika's apprentice.

00:21:25.951 --> 00:21:27.870
[KODAMA'S MOTHER]
Kodama? You in there?

00:21:27.912 --> 00:21:30.748
[KODAMA sobs]
Mm-Hm.

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:33.209
There's a tree the men
can't seem to chop down.

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:36.253
They were wondering if you
might have any suggestions.

00:21:36.295 --> 00:21:37.630
[KODAMA]
I'll take a look.

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:41.467
I'll be right back, okay?

00:21:41.509 --> 00:21:43.928
Sure. Take your time.

00:21:56.023 --> 00:21:59.151
[GINKO grunts]
It's cold...

00:21:59.193 --> 00:22:00.319
[MUJIKA]
To what end?

00:22:00.361 --> 00:22:02.112
It won't do any good.
Believe me.

00:22:02.154 --> 00:22:04.448
This is the only way
to set things right.

00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:05.282
[GINKO]
You don't know that!

00:22:05.324 --> 00:22:07.618
You still have a choice!

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:11.497
In the end, I guess
he was right.

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:24.051
[GINKO]
It was a noble thing he did.

00:22:24.093 --> 00:22:26.846
Though I doubt you care
about his intentions.

00:22:28.138 --> 00:22:30.266
[GINKO]
Right, <i>kuchinawa?</i>

00:22:46.866 --> 00:22:49.618
[GINKO]
Perhaps, as a mighty yawn,

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:53.289
the <i>kuchinawa's</i> voice
rang out one final time.

00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:56.834
Then, silently,
it lowered its head,

00:22:56.876 --> 00:23:00.212
and tightened its coils
around the mountain.

00:23:49.011 --> 00:23:51.764
