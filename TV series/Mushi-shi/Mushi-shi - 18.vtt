00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:12.721
[GINKO]
So, what else do you have?

00:00:12.763 --> 00:00:14.556
This exquisite coat.

00:00:14.598 --> 00:00:18.602
Ah! Well, I've got
to admit, it's lovely.

00:00:18.644 --> 00:00:20.103
[ANTIQUES DEALER] It's the
handiwork of a painter

00:00:20.145 --> 00:00:21.855
who was very famous once.

00:00:21.897 --> 00:00:24.483
A one-of-a-kind item.

00:00:24.525 --> 00:00:25.776
Look at the detail.

00:00:25.817 --> 00:00:29.321
There's someone cooking
in the mountains here.

00:00:29.363 --> 00:00:31.240
Sometimes when you look at it,

00:00:31.281 --> 00:00:33.575
it seems you can actually
see the white smoke

00:00:33.617 --> 00:00:36.578
rising up in the design.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.455
You could almost
imagine it's coming from

00:00:38.497 --> 00:00:42.876
the chimneys of people's homes
way up on the mountain.

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:57.641
[KAI] So, have you ever
seen them, Father?

00:00:57.683 --> 00:01:00.310
The people that live
up in those mountains?

00:01:00.352 --> 00:01:02.312
Hm? I think
you're mistaken, son.

00:01:02.354 --> 00:01:03.897
No one lives up there.

00:01:05.023 --> 00:01:09.611
But I... I always see
lots of smoke rising.

00:01:09.653 --> 00:01:13.031
It's probably just some
hunters burning charcoal.

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:14.700
Maybe the mountain god
who lives up there

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:17.536
is cooking his dinner.

00:01:17.578 --> 00:01:19.746
[KAI]
Gods cook, too? Really?

00:01:19.788 --> 00:01:22.499
Of course. How else
are they going to eat?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.586
[KAI]
Gods don't get hungry, Sis.

00:01:25.627 --> 00:01:28.130
[KAI'S SISTER] Maybe he's
heating his bath, then.

00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:30.674
[KAI'S FATHER] Hey, you two!
It's getting late!

00:01:30.716 --> 00:01:32.467
Run on home
and get dinner started.

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:34.261
I'll be along shortly,
all right?

00:01:34.303 --> 00:01:35.596
--Okay!
--Yes, sir!

00:01:35.637 --> 00:01:37.180
All right, come on!

00:01:57.367 --> 00:01:59.828
[KAI] Back then,
there were mysterious things

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.371
on the mountain.

00:02:01.413 --> 00:02:04.583
Today, it still looks much
as it did when I was young,

00:02:04.625 --> 00:02:07.169
but it's no longer the same.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.465
When we were children,
it was a magical place to live.

00:02:11.506 --> 00:02:14.551
So was our village.
They were like delicate,

00:02:14.593 --> 00:02:18.430
beautiful things
wrapped in a soft cloth.

00:02:18.472 --> 00:02:20.849
Hey, uh... What's this?

00:02:20.891 --> 00:02:22.601
Just a little something
I made so you'd look

00:02:22.643 --> 00:02:26.146
more respectable
for your art teacher.

00:02:26.188 --> 00:02:28.273
It's woven from silk thread
from the silkworms

00:02:28.315 --> 00:02:30.359
on the mountain,
and it's dyed with plants

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.527
that grow there, too.

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.530
Kai, if you can't
return home for some time,

00:02:35.572 --> 00:02:38.825
I'll understand.

00:02:38.867 --> 00:02:41.078
And don't worry,
Father will change his mind

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:43.830
about your career. You'll see.

00:02:45.332 --> 00:02:47.542
Now if you get lonely,

00:02:47.584 --> 00:02:52.798
just look at this coat and
it will remind you of home.

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:55.550
Thanks, Sis. I will.

00:02:56.802 --> 00:02:59.596
[KAI] And I will become
a fine artist, I promise.

00:02:59.638 --> 00:03:02.099
I'll come back
as soon as I can.

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:24.913
[KAI]
Will Master ever let me paint?

00:03:24.955 --> 00:03:27.207
How many months has it been?

00:03:27.249 --> 00:03:32.212
Father, Sis.
I really miss you.

00:03:39.094 --> 00:03:42.055
[ARTIST]
Hey. You there.

00:03:42.097 --> 00:03:44.641
Take these dishes.
Rinse them out.

00:03:44.683 --> 00:03:46.309
[KAI]
Yes, sir!

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.264
Looks like spring
is finally here.

00:04:26.892 --> 00:04:29.269
Kai! I need you!

00:04:29.311 --> 00:04:31.354
[KAI]
Coming!

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:44.910
[ARTIST]
Is this your coat?

00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:48.955
This painting.
Whose work is it?

00:04:48.997 --> 00:04:51.708
[KAI] It's mine.
Forgive me, Master.

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.586
I wanted to paint so badly!

00:04:54.628 --> 00:04:57.005
You're the one
who painted this?

00:04:57.047 --> 00:04:58.507
[KAI]
Yes.

00:04:58.548 --> 00:05:00.967
[ARTIST]
I don't like it.

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:03.720
No, I don't like it at all.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.474
[KAI]
Master!

00:05:07.516 --> 00:05:10.393
From hereon,
you'll be in the studio.

00:05:10.435 --> 00:05:12.687
Starting tomorrow.

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:15.440
Not that there's much
I can teach you.

00:05:28.537 --> 00:05:34.292
[KAI] Out of paint? Already?!
I was so close to finishing.

00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:38.380
[ART DEALER] Sensei!
So, how's it coming along?

00:05:38.421 --> 00:05:40.549
The delivery date
is coming up soon.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.385
[chuckles]
Don't worry. I'll make it.

00:05:45.512 --> 00:05:48.765
[KAI] Dead broke.
What do I do now?

00:05:48.807 --> 00:05:51.476
I've borrowed and begged
from everyone that I could.

00:05:51.518 --> 00:05:53.895
There's nothing left to sell.

00:05:56.648 --> 00:05:58.316
[PAWN SHOP OWNER]
It's not in the best condition.

00:05:58.358 --> 00:06:00.068
I can't give you very much.

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.488
[KAI] Please! Can't you
offer me a little more?!

00:06:07.784 --> 00:06:10.829
It's magnificient.
Truly magnificient.

00:06:10.871 --> 00:06:14.416
I applaud your master for
recommending you for this job.

00:06:14.457 --> 00:06:16.376
It's amazing that
someone with your talent

00:06:16.418 --> 00:06:18.044
is still an unknown.

00:06:18.086 --> 00:06:20.630
Yes. Amazing.

00:06:20.672 --> 00:06:22.924
Tell me: do you think
you could possibly

00:06:22.966 --> 00:06:26.136
paint another one
like this by next month?

00:06:26.177 --> 00:06:29.097
My grandson's wedding
is coming up, you see.

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:31.516
I need a wedding gift
for him, and you need a way

00:06:31.558 --> 00:06:33.518
to expose
your talents to others.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.229
Yes! I'll get right on it!

00:06:51.328 --> 00:06:53.830
[KAI]
Wake up.

00:06:53.872 --> 00:06:56.207
Can't be sleeping right now.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.841
That painting of yours
was the talk of the wedding.

00:07:04.883 --> 00:07:08.678
Here, these are for you, my boy.
Commissions for work.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:13.934
Thank you for doing me proud.
And best of luck to you.

00:07:13.975 --> 00:07:17.145
I did it!

00:07:17.187 --> 00:07:21.066
At last! I said
I'd make it one day.

00:07:25.195 --> 00:07:27.614
Master, here are today's orders.

00:07:27.656 --> 00:07:30.742
Right. Leave them.
I'll get to them later.

00:07:39.084 --> 00:07:41.378
[KAI]
More orders for work, eh?

00:07:41.419 --> 00:07:44.839
They keep piling up
on top of each other.

00:07:44.881 --> 00:07:46.841
I can't keep up anymore.

00:07:53.723 --> 00:07:56.017
[MAN] I've never been
so terrified in my life.

00:07:56.059 --> 00:07:58.061
This landslide
was huge. Gigantic.

00:07:58.103 --> 00:08:00.814
It was so big that it
swept away an entire village.

00:08:00.855 --> 00:08:03.692
It was terrible.
I'm lucky to be alive.

00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:05.902
This happened a few
years ago out west,

00:08:05.944 --> 00:08:09.739
in the foothills of Mount
something-or-other...

00:08:09.781 --> 00:08:15.453
[KAI] Foothills?
No, it couldn't be, could it?

00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:18.206
Don't have time
to worry about it right now.

00:08:18.248 --> 00:08:21.418
There are
commissions to finish.

00:08:21.459 --> 00:08:23.503
I've got to keep working.

00:08:23.545 --> 00:08:27.132
I'm on the verge of making
a real name for myself.

00:08:27.173 --> 00:08:29.259
[ART DEALER]
Ah, very nice.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:33.304
The work of
a true master artist.

00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:36.683
However, and I beg your pardon,
but I have to ask...

00:08:36.725 --> 00:08:38.351
Have you not
been feeling well?

00:08:38.393 --> 00:08:39.936
Huh?

00:08:39.978 --> 00:08:41.479
[ART DEALER] It's just that your
previous paintings seemed

00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:44.024
so full of life,
but these recent ones?

00:08:44.065 --> 00:08:46.651
Well, they're just
not quite as vivid.

00:08:46.693 --> 00:08:48.528
I'm sure it's just a dry spell.

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:51.656
All artists have them
every now and then.

00:09:03.877 --> 00:09:07.005
Damn it! What--
What's wrong with me?

00:09:09.132 --> 00:09:11.926
[DOCTOR] You appear to be
suffering from fatigue.

00:09:11.968 --> 00:09:15.430
Take your medicine and get lots
of rest over the next few days.

00:09:15.472 --> 00:09:17.891
--But...
--No buts. Rest.

00:09:17.932 --> 00:09:20.268
Besides, your customers
won't mind waiting

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:23.229
for an artist
of your reputation.

00:09:29.069 --> 00:09:33.448
[KAI'S SISTER]
Kai. How are you feeling?

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:37.243
Take this, okay?
It'll make you feel better.

00:09:38.244 --> 00:09:42.582
[KAI]
Hey, Sis.

00:09:42.624 --> 00:09:45.877
How many years has it been
since you left to get married?

00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:48.088
You're doing well, I hope.

00:09:50.507 --> 00:09:55.428
How's Father? Has he ever
forgiven me for leaving?

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:58.264
Has it really been
ten years since I said goodbye

00:09:58.306 --> 00:10:00.767
and left the two of you?

00:10:00.809 --> 00:10:05.271
I'm sorry I've not kept
in touch. I'm selfish, I know.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.193
I want to walk
through our village again.

00:10:10.235 --> 00:10:12.278
Smell the mountain air

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.448
and listen to the sounds
of the streams.

00:10:18.118 --> 00:10:20.120
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:22.580
They're your family.

00:10:22.622 --> 00:10:24.874
I just want to see them.

00:10:24.916 --> 00:10:29.712
Then maybe I'll be able to paint
again, as well as I used to.

00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:44.811
[KAI]
Oh, no. It can't be.

00:10:50.608 --> 00:10:52.360
[KAI]
Auntie?!

00:10:52.402 --> 00:10:55.488
Is that...?

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:57.782
Kai?

00:10:57.824 --> 00:11:00.076
[KAI]
What... What happened here?

00:11:00.118 --> 00:11:01.953
[KAI'S AUNT] Your sister
wrote you a letter.

00:11:01.995 --> 00:11:04.873
You mean to tell me
you didn't get it?

00:11:04.914 --> 00:11:08.793
I see. I'll take
that as a "no."

00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:12.255
Three years ago there was
a terrible landslide.

00:11:12.297 --> 00:11:15.175
Homes, crops,
people, animals--

00:11:15.216 --> 00:11:17.969
almost everything
was swept away.

00:11:18.011 --> 00:11:20.430
We who survived got together

00:11:20.471 --> 00:11:22.473
and asked your sister
to write you.

00:11:22.515 --> 00:11:24.225
We were hoping that
since you had become

00:11:24.267 --> 00:11:26.102
a rich and famous artist,

00:11:26.144 --> 00:11:28.396
you would be able
to help the village.

00:11:28.438 --> 00:11:32.150
We waited for a response,
but it never came.

00:11:32.192 --> 00:11:34.777
[KAI] And Father and Sis?!
Where are they?!

00:11:34.819 --> 00:11:36.237
I'm sorry, Kai.

00:11:36.279 --> 00:11:39.574
I'm afraid your father
was killed in the landslide.

00:11:39.616 --> 00:11:41.743
The following year,
your sister died

00:11:41.784 --> 00:11:46.331
while giving birth to
this child: your niece.

00:11:47.165 --> 00:11:50.627
Now, I say this
for your own good.

00:11:50.668 --> 00:11:52.962
Leave this place, Kai.

00:11:53.004 --> 00:11:55.757
And never come back here.

00:12:05.433 --> 00:12:07.185
[ANTIQUES DEALER] He was
a very popular artist,

00:12:07.227 --> 00:12:08.978
and his fame just kept growing.

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:10.855
But one day,
he just up and left

00:12:10.897 --> 00:12:13.983
for parts unknown
and never came back.

00:12:14.025 --> 00:12:15.652
This coat's
a rare collector's item!

00:12:15.693 --> 00:12:17.904
The painting alone
would fetch a good price!

00:12:17.946 --> 00:12:19.530
[GINKO]
Huh...

00:12:20.698 --> 00:12:22.325
[ANTIQUES DEALER]
Well, what do you think?

00:12:22.367 --> 00:12:25.495
The silk is thin
but unusually heavy.

00:12:25.536 --> 00:12:28.039
And it definitely
smells of <i>mushi</i>.

00:12:28.081 --> 00:12:30.166
I'm sure you could get a
good price from that doctor

00:12:30.208 --> 00:12:32.585
who collects all those
curiosities, don't you think?

00:12:32.627 --> 00:12:34.837
Well, how does
this price sound to you?

00:12:34.879 --> 00:12:36.589
[GINKO]
Hmm.

00:12:36.631 --> 00:12:38.675
It doesn't appear dangerous,
but until I know

00:12:38.716 --> 00:12:40.134
the true
nature of the <i>mushi</i>,

00:12:40.176 --> 00:12:44.347
I'd be taking a risk, so I can't
ask him to pay a high price.

00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:46.099
I'll take it at half price.

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:49.143
[laughs]
You can't be serious!

00:12:49.185 --> 00:12:51.771
Come on. You probably
bought this as scrap cloth.

00:12:51.813 --> 00:12:53.856
[ANTIQUES DEALER] No, no!
This is an investment.

00:12:53.898 --> 00:12:56.150
One that you could
resell at a higher price!

00:12:56.192 --> 00:12:58.903
[GINKO] I have no desire to
deal with troublesome <i>mushi</i>.

00:12:58.945 --> 00:13:01.364
And besides, no <i>mushi</i> master
in their right mind

00:13:01.406 --> 00:13:04.534
would fork over a fortune for
something like this, my friend.

00:13:04.575 --> 00:13:06.619
[ANTIQUES DEALER]
No, wait! Listen...

00:13:06.661 --> 00:13:08.788
Maybe this
will change your mind.

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:10.748
It's been said that
this mountain is located

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:14.043
near the artist's hometown.
An important clue.

00:13:14.085 --> 00:13:15.962
Won't this help
your investigation?

00:13:16.004 --> 00:13:18.798
[GINKO]
Yes. At half price.

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:21.718
[ANTIQUES DEALER sighs]
Okay. You win.

00:13:22.844 --> 00:13:30.393
[knock at door]

00:13:30.435 --> 00:13:34.397
[STUDENT] Master, I'm very sorry
to hear about your family.

00:13:34.439 --> 00:13:38.735
But, sir. The orders.
You must come back.

00:13:38.776 --> 00:13:43.239
No. I can't go back.

00:13:43.281 --> 00:13:49.370
I can't even... paint...
anything... anymore.

00:13:49.412 --> 00:13:51.789
When I hold the brush,

00:13:51.831 --> 00:13:55.626
nothing inspires
me anymore. Nothing.

00:13:59.213 --> 00:14:01.007
[KAI]
The mountain.

00:14:01.049 --> 00:14:04.594
It looks so foreign to me,
like it's out of place.

00:14:04.635 --> 00:14:07.055
Just like me in this village.

00:14:07.096 --> 00:14:11.392
I've become an outcast
in my own home.

00:14:11.434 --> 00:14:13.519
Maybe it would be best
if I moved away

00:14:13.561 --> 00:14:16.773
to some place where
no one's ever heard of me.

00:14:21.736 --> 00:14:23.321
[KAI]
What's this?

00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:31.746
[KAI] The taste of home.
It's been too long.

00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:55.019
[KAI]
Well, what do you know?

00:14:55.061 --> 00:14:56.979
I don't feel dizzy
for a change.

00:14:57.021 --> 00:14:58.981
And I have energy.

00:15:01.192 --> 00:15:02.402
Oh, hello there, Toyo.

00:15:02.443 --> 00:15:04.445
Playing by yourself today, huh?

00:15:04.487 --> 00:15:07.156
I was bringing a gift
to you and Granny.

00:15:07.198 --> 00:15:09.075
Where is she? In the house?

00:15:09.117 --> 00:15:12.578
Granny no wake up 'day.
She's cold.

00:15:15.748 --> 00:15:17.667
[VILLAGER A] What should
we do about the child?

00:15:17.708 --> 00:15:20.294
[VILLAGER B] Doesn't she have
relatives on her father's side?

00:15:20.336 --> 00:15:22.004
[VILLAGER B] If I recall,
they live far away,

00:15:22.046 --> 00:15:23.965
but she should go to them.

00:15:24.006 --> 00:15:26.092
I'll do it! Please!
Let me raise her!

00:15:26.134 --> 00:15:28.386
She's my niece!

00:15:28.428 --> 00:15:30.638
I beg you!

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.390
Give her to you?
This child is mentally

00:15:32.432 --> 00:15:34.976
and physically slow.

00:15:35.017 --> 00:15:38.354
Come now, artist.
You can't raise her.

00:15:38.396 --> 00:15:41.691
[KAI] I can! I promise
to give her a good home.

00:15:41.732 --> 00:15:43.568
And love her!

00:15:43.609 --> 00:15:45.319
Don't send her away!

00:15:45.361 --> 00:15:48.072
She's the only
family I have left!

00:15:49.532 --> 00:15:53.161
[KAI] Toyo, can you help me hold
this up for a second, please?

00:15:56.122 --> 00:15:58.583
[KAI]
Good girl.

00:15:58.624 --> 00:16:00.543
[VILLAGER C]
That's not going to work.

00:16:00.585 --> 00:16:02.462
Here, let me show you.

00:16:02.503 --> 00:16:06.174
If you do it that way,
it will topple right over.

00:16:06.215 --> 00:16:08.968
Here you go.
Be Careful. Don't spill it.

00:16:12.013 --> 00:16:15.183
[KAI] Poor thing.
She's five years old,

00:16:15.224 --> 00:16:17.393
but mentally still a baby.

00:16:18.561 --> 00:16:21.522
It's yummy!

00:16:21.564 --> 00:16:22.940
[chuckles]

00:16:35.328 --> 00:16:37.330
[WOMAN] Thank you for
your hard work today, Kai.

00:16:37.371 --> 00:16:40.750
Here. These are
for your niece.

00:16:40.791 --> 00:16:43.669
[KAI] Toyo's sure going
to love these.

00:16:54.096 --> 00:16:56.807
[KAI]
It's back to normal.

00:16:56.849 --> 00:17:00.436
The mountain.
It's back to normal.

00:17:03.272 --> 00:17:06.692
The smoke. But how?

00:17:11.489 --> 00:17:13.366
[KAI]
What is this?

00:17:18.955 --> 00:17:20.456
Uuh!

00:17:23.417 --> 00:17:27.171
Damn. Ugh! Thought I
was a goner there.

00:17:27.213 --> 00:17:30.132
I knew it. I should have
never bought that thing.

00:17:31.425 --> 00:17:33.344
What the--? Who are you?

00:17:33.386 --> 00:17:37.014
Me? No one that
you need to worry about.

00:17:39.976 --> 00:17:43.271
[GINKO]
It's gotten lighter.

00:17:43.312 --> 00:17:47.108
[KAI] Wait, that's...
That's my old coat.

00:17:49.986 --> 00:17:52.446
So, I've been searching
for the mountain

00:17:52.488 --> 00:17:54.115
in this painting
in the hopes I can find out

00:17:54.156 --> 00:17:56.659
more about the <i>mushi</i>
that live in the coat.

00:17:56.701 --> 00:17:58.286
I knew I had to be
getting close when

00:17:58.327 --> 00:18:00.204
something strange
happened when I set foot

00:18:00.246 --> 00:18:01.872
on the mountain.

00:18:07.378 --> 00:18:11.132
Why's the...
pack getting so... heavy?!

00:18:12.508 --> 00:18:14.218
What the--?
What's happening?!

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.262
[groans]

00:18:18.014 --> 00:18:19.640
Thankfully
I was able to escape,

00:18:19.682 --> 00:18:21.601
but only after the <i>mushi</i>
had left the coat.

00:18:21.642 --> 00:18:24.061
Can't say I enjoyed
the taste of that mud, though.

00:18:24.103 --> 00:18:25.438
[KAI chuckles]

00:18:25.479 --> 00:18:29.442
That little mudbath gave me
all the answers I needed.

00:18:29.483 --> 00:18:30.818
The <i>mushi</i> that were
in that coat

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:33.487
were a type of <i>ubusuna</i>
native to this region.

00:18:33.529 --> 00:18:36.407
<i>Ubu...suna</i>?

00:18:36.449 --> 00:18:38.618
[GINKO] <i>Mushi</i> unique
to each region.

00:18:38.659 --> 00:18:40.620
They usually resemble mud.

00:18:40.661 --> 00:18:42.455
When they're in
the ground, that is.

00:18:42.496 --> 00:18:45.791
But above ground?
Well, that's another story.

00:18:45.833 --> 00:18:47.918
There they take
the form of smoke.

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:51.714
I understand there was a big
landslide here years ago.

00:18:51.756 --> 00:18:55.676
A large number of <i>ubusuna</i> were
probably also swept away then.

00:18:55.718 --> 00:18:58.387
Some of those <i>ubusuna</i>
must have found this coat,

00:18:58.429 --> 00:19:01.557
nested in it,
and made it their home.

00:19:01.599 --> 00:19:04.977
And apparently, there were
a lot of them in there.

00:19:05.019 --> 00:19:08.439
<i>Ubusuna</i> normally can't survive
outside their own region,

00:19:08.481 --> 00:19:11.233
so tell me something.
This fabric.

00:19:11.275 --> 00:19:14.195
It was woven from local
materials, wasn't it?

00:19:14.236 --> 00:19:17.073
Yes. My sister.

00:19:17.114 --> 00:19:18.491
She made it
completely from things

00:19:18.532 --> 00:19:20.201
she found on the mountain.

00:19:21.744 --> 00:19:23.162
When I was away,

00:19:23.204 --> 00:19:25.706
wearing it reminded me
of the smell of home.

00:19:25.748 --> 00:19:28.167
For me, it was home.

00:19:28.209 --> 00:19:31.170
<i>Ubusuna</i> are attracted to
the scents of their homeland.

00:19:31.212 --> 00:19:35.174
Thus, they tend to dwell mostly
within the local plant life.

00:19:35.216 --> 00:19:38.302
However, when people
eat those particular plants

00:19:38.344 --> 00:19:41.097
they become hosts
for the <i>ubusuna</i> as well.

00:19:41.138 --> 00:19:42.848
Even though they can
be found everywhere,

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:44.767
these <i>mushi</i>
aren't very powerful.

00:19:44.809 --> 00:19:47.144
In fact, if a host
leaves the region,

00:19:47.186 --> 00:19:49.563
they lose their power
altogether.

00:19:49.605 --> 00:19:52.024
But if they return to the
region where they were born,

00:19:52.066 --> 00:19:54.735
their power returns,
and they protect you for life

00:19:54.777 --> 00:19:57.238
from other minor <i>mushi</i>
that might do you harm.

00:19:57.279 --> 00:19:59.365
Could the <i>ubusuna</i> affect
a child's development?

00:19:59.407 --> 00:20:01.409
Make them slow, perhaps?

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:02.910
It's a possibility.

00:20:02.952 --> 00:20:04.537
If the child didn't
get enough <i>ubusuna</i>

00:20:04.578 --> 00:20:06.247
when it was weaned
from its mother,

00:20:06.288 --> 00:20:08.290
that could have caused it.

00:20:08.332 --> 00:20:10.876
If that was the case,
there might be a cure

00:20:10.918 --> 00:20:14.213
since a large number of <i>ubusuna</i>
have now returned to the area.

00:20:14.255 --> 00:20:16.257
They'll be nesting
in the plants again.

00:20:16.298 --> 00:20:18.926
With any luck, she might
gradually catch up

00:20:18.968 --> 00:20:21.554
if you feed her
plenty of local foods.

00:20:21.595 --> 00:20:23.514
I understand.

00:20:23.556 --> 00:20:27.727
Say... You don't have any need
for my coat anymore, do you?

00:20:27.768 --> 00:20:30.771
Will you...
maybe sell it back to me?

00:20:30.813 --> 00:20:32.940
I wish I could,
but I've already promised it

00:20:32.982 --> 00:20:35.192
to someone else. Sorry.

00:20:35.234 --> 00:20:38.946
[KAI] Please! This coat
means a lot to me!

00:20:38.988 --> 00:20:41.323
[sighs]

00:20:41.365 --> 00:20:43.451
All right.

00:20:43.492 --> 00:20:47.288
It's yours. But only
under one condition...

00:20:48.581 --> 00:20:51.208
[ADASHINO] Ah! A coat
where <i>ubusuna</i> live?

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:53.210
Very interesting...

00:20:53.252 --> 00:20:55.629
[GINKO] Yes.
And once in a great while,

00:20:55.671 --> 00:20:58.466
smoke rises from the mountain
in the painting.

00:20:58.507 --> 00:21:01.886
[ADASHINO]
Really? How long of a while?

00:21:01.927 --> 00:21:05.681
Well, I'd say about...
once every ten years or so.

00:21:05.723 --> 00:21:08.225
[ADASHINO]
I'll take it then.

00:21:08.267 --> 00:21:10.853
Hmm, this painting...

00:21:10.895 --> 00:21:13.230
It's quite a work of art,
I must say.

00:21:13.272 --> 00:21:17.568
Yes. The work of an artistic
genius who disappeared.

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:20.571
[ADASHINO] Ooh. I can't
wait to see the smoke!

00:21:20.613 --> 00:21:23.574
[GINKO] Well...
I almost drowned in mud.

00:21:23.616 --> 00:21:27.119
I guess I can be
forgiven for this.

00:21:27.161 --> 00:21:29.622
[KAI]
Paint? On this?

00:21:29.663 --> 00:21:32.500
Yes. Just like that.

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.921
[GINKO] Do you
still have some paint?

00:21:36.962 --> 00:21:41.050
Yeah. I do.
Let me go get them.

00:21:51.268 --> 00:21:53.270
[yawns]

00:21:59.527 --> 00:22:01.529
Hey! You're really good, Kai.

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:03.197
