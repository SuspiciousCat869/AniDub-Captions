when your back
is facing the sun.

00:09:36.159 --> 00:09:41.206
A <i>Koda</i> will appear with
no regard to the sun's position.

Second, the order of
the colors is reversed.

seeing these differences,

to be out traveling

Why would you
stop to help a stranger?

00:10:00.058 --> 00:10:03.186
Like I said before,
I want to see it, as well.

00:10:03.228 --> 00:10:05.772
Besides, I didn't really
have any special destination

00:10:05.814 --> 00:10:07.649
I was heading to.

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:10.735
Even so, I can't search
for the <i>Koda</i> forever.

00:10:10.777 --> 00:10:12.821
I'll keep looking
until next autumn.

00:10:12.862 --> 00:10:15.615
If we don't find it
by then, I'll quit.

Sound good?

00:10:18.243 --> 00:10:20.078
[GINKO] It seems to
behave like a rainbow,

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.705
in that it often
appears after it rains.

We'll move by
reading the weather.

experience doing just that.

00:11:24.976 --> 00:11:26.728
It's been five years.

00:11:29.606 --> 00:11:30.857
Wow...

00:11:30.899 --> 00:11:32.192
Five years, huh?

00:11:32.233 --> 00:11:33.234
So then...

00:11:33.276 --> 00:11:37.280
That story about your father
being sick is a lie, isn't it?

00:11:37.322 --> 00:11:39.240
No one would travel
around for five years

00:11:39.282 --> 00:11:41.075
with sick family at home.

00:11:42.785 --> 00:11:45.872
Wanting to show it
to my father isn't a lie.

00:11:45.914 --> 00:11:50.043
But that's not the reason
I started this quest.

00:11:50.084 --> 00:11:52.629
Did I ever tell you my name?

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:53.630
[GINKO]
No.

00:11:53.671 --> 00:11:57.008
It's Koro.
It means Rainbow Man.

00:11:57.050 --> 00:12:01.554
It carries my father's will to
forever search for the rainbow.

00:12:01.596 --> 00:12:02.722
Because of that name,

00:12:02.764 --> 00:12:05.558
I was the laughing stock
of my village.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.768
In a western province,

00:12:06.809 --> 00:12:09.520
there's a famous river
that often overflows.

00:12:09.562 --> 00:12:13.524
My family has put a bridge over
that river for generations.

00:12:13.566 --> 00:12:15.318
No matter how
many times it was built,

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:18.029
the bridge would wash away
with every flood.

00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:21.908
Everyone hoped that my father
would solve this problem.

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:24.911
My brother had a talent
for designing the bridge.

00:12:24.953 --> 00:12:26.329
Every time it was destroyed,

00:12:26.371 --> 00:12:28.414
he'd think of a
better way to build it.

00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.292
I, on the other hand,

00:12:31.334 --> 00:12:33.419
didn't have an ounce
of his talent.

00:12:36.297 --> 00:12:39.259
After tearing a tendon,
I lost most of the mobility

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:41.010
in my left hand.

00:12:41.052 --> 00:12:44.347
As a builder, I was
worse than second rate.

00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:45.556
Before I knew it,

00:12:45.598 --> 00:12:47.642
the only place for me
in the whole village

00:12:47.684 --> 00:12:49.435
was at my father's side.

00:12:51.604 --> 00:12:53.439
I couldn't stand
living like that.

00:12:53.481 --> 00:12:55.400
I decided to run away.

00:12:58.486 --> 00:13:00.405
Would you mind
explaining something to me?

00:13:00.446 --> 00:13:02.824
Why are you still
searching for the rainbow?

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:07.453
Each time I see one,

00:13:07.495 --> 00:13:09.747
I can't keep myself
from chasing after it.

00:13:11.666 --> 00:13:13.209
[KORO]
Don't fade!

00:13:13.251 --> 00:13:14.794
Don't fade away!

00:13:17.672 --> 00:13:20.883
[KORO] Maybe I wanted to confirm
what my father had told me.

00:13:20.925 --> 00:13:23.219
Maybe I wanted to show all
the people that laughed at us

00:13:23.261 --> 00:13:24.929
that this was the reason.

00:13:27.724 --> 00:13:29.726
Even after I ran away
from the village,

00:13:29.767 --> 00:13:32.854
I was still just
nothing but a joke.

00:13:32.895 --> 00:13:34.981
I had nothing. No purpose.

00:13:35.023 --> 00:13:39.527
No one should live just
for the sake of living.

00:13:39.569 --> 00:13:40.778
A purpose, huh?

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:44.365
When we met, you said you
had no special destination.

00:13:44.407 --> 00:13:47.702
Well... I suppose
you have your reasons.

00:13:47.744 --> 00:13:50.288
But roaming around
is not an easy life.

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:53.833
You can't just go on traveling
about without a purpose.

00:13:53.875 --> 00:13:56.794
Sometimes I just want
to take a break, you know.

00:13:56.836 --> 00:14:00.590
So when I get like that,
I set a goal like this one.

00:14:00.631 --> 00:14:03.968
And that, in turn,
creates a little leisure time.

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:06.137
The people who live just
for the sake of living

00:14:06.179 --> 00:14:07.972
have no leisure time.

00:14:10.099 --> 00:14:11.684
[KORO] I'm taking
this search seriously,

00:14:11.726 --> 00:14:13.811
and for you it's
just "leisure time"?

00:14:13.853 --> 00:14:16.314
[GINKO]
I'm taking this seriously, too.

00:14:16.356 --> 00:14:18.358
[KORO]
It's an issue of attitude.

00:14:18.399 --> 00:14:19.484
What's that mean?

00:14:19.525 --> 00:14:23.321
To live, it's important to get
some rest and relaxation.

00:14:23.363 --> 00:14:27.700
Besides, it's a better reason
than yours for doing this.

00:14:27.742 --> 00:14:29.160
You're only searching
for the rainbow

00:14:29.202 --> 00:14:31.496
to ease the guilt
you've been carrying around.

00:14:34.082 --> 00:14:35.333
Such a waste.

00:14:35.375 --> 00:14:36.709
You should've just
let all that go,

00:14:36.751 --> 00:14:39.837
settled down somewhere,
and forgotten about the past.

00:14:43.716 --> 00:14:45.551
You're probably right.

00:14:45.593 --> 00:14:48.304
But I just couldn't.
That's why I'm here.

00:14:48.346 --> 00:14:49.430
Who knows?

00:14:49.472 --> 00:14:51.682
Maybe it's time to
put an end to all this.

00:14:51.724 --> 00:14:53.059
I think I'll
stick with your plan

00:14:53.101 --> 00:14:54.936
and give up
the search by fall.

00:14:57.313 --> 00:14:59.690
[GINKO]
Hey! Koro!

00:14:59.732 --> 00:15:00.983
Wait up!

00:15:09.117 --> 00:15:11.452
[GINKO]
Ah! You have a good eye, sir!

00:15:11.494 --> 00:15:13.162
Those are mermaid's nails.

00:15:13.204 --> 00:15:17.125
When crushed and consumed
as tea, it makes a love potion.

00:15:17.166 --> 00:15:19.001
I'll give you a good deal.

00:15:19.043 --> 00:15:21.212
[MAN B] That's not exactly
what I was looking for.

00:15:21.254 --> 00:15:23.089
Got something that
can make it rain?

00:15:23.131 --> 00:15:25.299
Sorry, there's no such thing.

00:15:25.341 --> 00:15:27.468
[MAN B]
If this drought continues,

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:29.470
the fields and crops
will dry up.

00:15:29.512 --> 00:15:32.515
If I had something like that,
I would have used it by now.

00:15:34.725 --> 00:15:36.185
[GINKO]
Hey!

00:15:36.227 --> 00:15:38.354
Keep a close eye on the sky.

00:15:38.396 --> 00:15:40.815
It's got to rain sometime,
doesn't it?

00:15:46.279 --> 00:15:51.492
[KORO] My throat's dry.
I can't even sweat anymore.

00:15:57.123 --> 00:15:58.416
[KORO'S FATHER]
The rain is coming.

00:15:58.458 --> 00:15:59.459
[KORO gasps]

00:16:03.337 --> 00:16:05.089
[KORO'S FATHER]
The rain is coming!

00:16:05.131 --> 00:16:07.717
It's coming! It's coming!

00:16:13.389 --> 00:16:15.433
[KORO'S FATHER]
A rainbow will appear!

00:16:15.475 --> 00:16:16.601
[KORO]
Ginko!

00:16:18.978 --> 00:16:20.980
Look! There!

00:16:21.022 --> 00:16:23.483
It's a rainbow.

00:16:23.524 --> 00:16:25.109
And the sun.

00:16:27.653 --> 00:16:29.363
Hey! The love potion!

00:16:29.405 --> 00:16:31.574
Sorry. The shop's closed now.

00:16:31.616 --> 00:16:33.201
[GINKO]
Hey! Don't run like that!

00:16:33.242 --> 00:16:34.994
You'll never last!

00:16:35.036 --> 00:16:38.039
[BOTH panting]

00:16:45.213 --> 00:16:46.422
Damnit!

00:16:46.464 --> 00:16:48.132
Where did it go?!

00:16:49.342 --> 00:16:51.969
We're close.
It's gotta be here somewhere.

00:16:52.011 --> 00:16:54.764
It looks like this area
will still get some rain.

00:16:56.432 --> 00:16:59.602
I don't think
it could have gone too far.

00:16:59.644 --> 00:17:01.604
Let's wait here for the day.

00:17:12.698 --> 00:17:15.493
[KORO] I knew where the rain
would be without seeing it.

00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:20.915
[KORO] Was it like this
for my father, too?

00:17:20.957 --> 00:17:23.125
[KORO'S FATHER]
Koro...

00:17:23.167 --> 00:17:25.294
Now that you've grown up,

00:17:25.336 --> 00:17:26.796
I'm sure that...

00:17:26.837 --> 00:17:29.423
I'm sure that you've
slowly grown to detest

00:17:29.465 --> 00:17:31.050
the name that I gave you.

00:17:31.092 --> 00:17:32.969
I'm sorry, son.

00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:36.556
I just wanted to name you after
something precious to me.

00:17:36.597 --> 00:17:41.269
The most beautiful thing
I ever saw.

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:43.771
Please, forgive me.

00:17:43.813 --> 00:17:46.148
Even your friends tease you
because of your name,

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:47.441
don't they?

00:17:49.193 --> 00:17:50.152
[KORO'S FATHER]
Here.

00:17:50.194 --> 00:17:52.655
I came up with new one.

00:17:52.697 --> 00:17:53.864
A name.

00:17:53.906 --> 00:17:56.492
A much better name.

00:17:56.534 --> 00:17:59.537
Use it starting tomorrow.

00:17:59.579 --> 00:18:01.330
No, Father.

00:18:02.206 --> 00:18:03.833
I don't want it.

00:18:03.874 --> 00:18:05.876
Don't say such things.

00:18:05.918 --> 00:18:07.753
I'll never give up.

00:18:07.795 --> 00:18:11.340
I'll keep trying until I'm the
best bridge builder there is.

00:18:13.801 --> 00:18:17.346
Even better than you.
You'll see.

00:18:40.745 --> 00:18:44.206
Hey. Koro.
Wake up. It's raining.

00:18:50.504 --> 00:18:51.505
[KORO gasps]

00:18:58.554 --> 00:19:00.014
There!

00:19:00.056 --> 00:19:01.307
[GINKO]
Come on! Hurry!

00:19:30.127 --> 00:19:31.128
Incredible...

00:19:32.546 --> 00:19:34.715
[KORO'S FATHER] I just wanted
to name you after something

00:19:34.757 --> 00:19:36.217
precious to me.

00:19:36.258 --> 00:19:38.969
The most beautiful thing
I ever saw.

00:19:39.011 --> 00:19:40.388
Beautiful...

00:19:42.848 --> 00:19:44.141
Koro!

00:19:44.183 --> 00:19:47.436
[KORO] What my father
told me was true.

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:51.273
This is something
I simply must take home.

00:19:51.315 --> 00:19:52.483
[electric buzz]

00:20:06.997 --> 00:20:08.958
That was stupid.

00:20:08.999 --> 00:20:10.376
Are you all right?

00:20:10.418 --> 00:20:12.837
Huh? Yeah.

00:20:12.878 --> 00:20:15.589
[GINKO] I wasn't sure
until I saw it up close.

00:20:15.631 --> 00:20:17.800
But I felt a shock
when I touched it.

00:20:17.842 --> 00:20:20.344
This is one of the <i>Nagaremono</i>.

00:20:20.386 --> 00:20:22.972
[KORO]
<i>Nagaremono</i>?

00:20:23.013 --> 00:20:25.182
[GINKO] It's a being
that possesses life,

00:20:25.224 --> 00:20:28.936
but looks like a form
of natural phenomena.

00:20:28.978 --> 00:20:31.147
Other than the fact
that it's alive,

00:20:31.188 --> 00:20:35.234
it's identical to the rainbows
made by the rain and sun.

00:20:35.276 --> 00:20:39.405
This one was most likely
created by the light and rain,

00:20:39.447 --> 00:20:41.574
infused with <i>Koki</i>.

00:20:41.615 --> 00:20:42.992
[KORO]
<i>Koki</i>?

00:20:43.033 --> 00:20:45.369
[GINKO]
The basis of <i>mushi</i> life.

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:51.417
[GINKO] <i>Nagaremono</i> are similar
to floods and typhoons.

00:20:51.459 --> 00:20:55.796
They happen for a reason,
but they have no purpose.

00:20:55.838 --> 00:20:58.799
They exist only
to travel and flow.

00:20:58.841 --> 00:21:03.971
They have an effect on others,
but nothing can affect them.

00:21:04.013 --> 00:21:07.600
If you touch this type of
<i>mushi</i>, it will attach to you.

00:21:11.562 --> 00:21:16.066
[KORO] For a moment,
I felt like I was inside of it.

00:21:16.108 --> 00:21:18.402
I wonder if my father
was drawn in

00:21:18.444 --> 00:21:20.821
by that same rise and flow.

00:21:23.699 --> 00:21:28.162
It didn't feel like
my opponent, but it...

00:21:28.204 --> 00:21:30.664
It feels like
part of me is gone.

00:21:32.583 --> 00:21:34.710
But it's good.

00:21:34.752 --> 00:21:37.338
Refreshing, even.

00:21:37.379 --> 00:21:39.298
So what are you
going to do now?

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:40.633
Who knows?

00:21:40.674 --> 00:21:43.260
I'll have to think about it.

00:21:43.302 --> 00:21:44.595
And you?

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:49.934
[KORO chuckles]
I think I know.

00:21:49.975 --> 00:21:52.978
You're just going to
flow again, aren't you?

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:56.023
Just like that rainbow.

00:21:56.065 --> 00:22:00.152
[GINKO] After that, I'm not sure
what happened to that man.

00:22:00.194 --> 00:22:02.780
But I did hear that in
a province to the west,

00:22:02.822 --> 00:22:04.865
an indestructible bridge
had been built

00:22:04.907 --> 00:22:07.368
across a raging river.

00:22:07.409 --> 00:22:09.495
Whenever it would
start to overflow,

00:22:09.537 --> 00:22:11.497
he'd remove the binding pieces,

00:22:11.539 --> 00:22:14.500
allowing the water
to flow between.

00:22:14.542 --> 00:22:17.878
When the waters receded,
he'd put them back.

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:20.881
The "Nagare-bashi,"
as the bridge was called,

00:22:20.923 --> 00:22:23.676
was built from
the ideas of one man.

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:51.472
