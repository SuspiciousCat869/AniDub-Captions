But <i>tamamayu</i>
are made by two pupa,

I unwind them and remake
them into two cocoons.

00:11:29.898 --> 00:11:32.150
Since this makes
its "home" much thinner,

00:11:32.192 --> 00:11:34.819
the <i>uro</i> that

[JIISAMA]
It's not addressed to me.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:29.582
Often times it's a request
to send a <i>mushi</i> master.

00:12:29.624 --> 00:12:33.294
Sometimes, a personal letter
from the <i>mushi</i> master's friend.

Ah, yes, here's the one.

<i>Mushi</i> masters never stay
in one place for too long.

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:41.219
They're not easy to locate.

00:12:41.261 --> 00:12:44.097
But if I put a letter
into cocoon one...

00:12:44.138 --> 00:12:46.224
...the <i>uro</i> will deliver
it to the <i>mushi</i> master

00:12:46.266 --> 00:12:50.728
who has cocoon two,
no matter where they may be.

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:52.647
The cocoons work well
for a while,

00:12:52.689 --> 00:12:55.400
but they need to be
replaced every few years.

00:12:55.441 --> 00:12:57.360
That's because of the <i>uro</i>.

00:12:57.402 --> 00:13:01.447
Over time, it opens up an <i>uro</i>
passageway inside the cocoon.

00:13:01.489 --> 00:13:04.158
Eventually, it penetrates
its way through

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:08.454
to a closed room somewhere,
or even another <i>uro</i> passageway.

00:13:08.496 --> 00:13:09.872
When that begins to happen,

00:13:13.293 --> 00:13:16.129

I can put

Ito. Aya. Listen. You must
never underestimate the <i>uro</i> .

00:13:24.762 --> 00:13:26.431
<i>Uro</i> are <i>mushi</i>.

Powerful <i>mushi</i> that can
open up holes in our world.

00:13:29.434 --> 00:13:32.854
You must always
treat them with caution.

00:13:32.895 --> 00:13:35.189
[JIISAMA] Many <i>uro</i> live
in the mountains and forests

00:13:35.231 --> 00:13:37.775
that surround our home,
and they breed wherever

00:13:37.817 --> 00:13:40.236
they can find an enclosed space.

00:13:40.278 --> 00:13:44.907
That's why you must never fully
close any of the doors.

00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:47.410
If you happen to
close a door by mistake,

00:13:47.452 --> 00:13:49.704
you must not open it.

If you do and

00:13:56.711 --> 00:13:59.964
along with the escaping <i>uro</i>.

00:14:00.006 --> 00:14:02.216
These <i>uro</i>...
They cannot survive

00:14:02.258 --> 00:14:06.179
very long at all
outside of closed spaces.

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:10.850
What happens to you if...
you're sucked in?

00:14:10.892 --> 00:14:12.435
[JIISAMA] You're condemned
to wander inside

00:14:12.477 --> 00:14:16.230
the <i>uro</i> passageway
for the rest of your life.

00:14:16.272 --> 00:14:18.858
Aya, don't worry.

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:21.819
That won't happen if
you follow my instructions.

00:14:21.861 --> 00:14:26.240
I've lived to a ripe old age
without an accident.

00:14:26.282 --> 00:14:28.117
Just remember:

00:14:28.159 --> 00:14:33.039
Never close doors
and never open doors.

00:14:39.212 --> 00:14:41.964
[ITO]
Hey, Aya...

00:14:42.006 --> 00:14:43.800
Done with the laundry yet?

00:14:43.841 --> 00:14:44.884
[AYA]
Yes.

00:14:44.926 --> 00:14:46.427
That's great!
Jiisama says we can play

00:14:46.469 --> 00:14:47.970
until dinner time then!

00:14:48.012 --> 00:14:52.058
[AYA] Really?! I'll put
this up... Wait for me.

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:55.144
[ITO]
Um, Aya...

00:14:55.186 --> 00:14:57.772
Remember:
don't shut the door.

00:15:04.195 --> 00:15:07.031
[ITO yawns]

00:15:07.073 --> 00:15:09.617
It's so nice outside today.

00:15:34.058 --> 00:15:36.144
[AYA]
Uh, Ito?

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.735
[ITO gasps]

00:15:46.362 --> 00:15:49.323
[AYA]
Hey, Ito. Are you asleep?

00:15:49.365 --> 00:15:51.117
[ITO]
Don't lift it!

00:15:58.166 --> 00:16:00.209
[AYA]
Ito...?

00:16:13.222 --> 00:16:16.976
It's my fault...
because I lifted the sheet.

00:16:17.018 --> 00:16:19.270
And... And because
I didn't pin it

00:16:19.312 --> 00:16:22.064
to the clothesline
tight enough.

00:16:22.106 --> 00:16:26.736
Aya, you mustn't
blame yourself.

00:16:26.777 --> 00:16:31.574
[AYA] Where's Ito?
Where did she go?

00:16:31.616 --> 00:16:35.661
How can we--
How can we bring her back?

00:16:35.703 --> 00:16:43.336
I'm afraid that...
there's no way, Aya.

00:16:43.377 --> 00:16:46.005
But there-- there must be.

00:16:48.633 --> 00:16:53.137
[AYA] I'll find a way.
I'm going to bring Ito back.

00:16:54.764 --> 00:16:57.558
We were always together.

00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:02.396
Playing. Laughing.
I never thought we'd be apart.

00:17:02.438 --> 00:17:05.066
It feels like it was only
yesterday she was here.

00:17:05.107 --> 00:17:08.027
Aya, you've been like this
for five years.

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:11.697
And you're still not sleeping
or eating much, I can tell.

00:17:11.739 --> 00:17:15.159
You've got to think about
yourself for a change.

00:17:17.828 --> 00:17:20.831
[GINKO] Would you like to enter
the <i>uro</i> passageway?

00:17:22.833 --> 00:17:25.670
[GINKO]
I'll go with you.

00:17:25.711 --> 00:17:29.340
You can see for yourself what
the <i>uro</i> passageway is like.

00:17:29.382 --> 00:17:30.967
What do you say?

00:17:40.685 --> 00:17:42.228
[GINKO]
Over there.

00:17:45.314 --> 00:17:47.441
[GINKO] When <i>uro</i> infest
a tree that lies along

00:17:47.483 --> 00:17:51.862
a light pulse vein, the trunk
swells up, like this.

00:17:51.904 --> 00:17:53.990
It's like an allergic reaction.

00:17:56.534 --> 00:17:58.953
Grab onto the chain
and follow me.

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:22.977
So that's the... passageway?

00:18:23.019 --> 00:18:27.148
Yes. But just the end of one.

00:18:27.189 --> 00:18:30.276
Soon, we'll reach
an <i>uro</i> cavern.

00:18:37.867 --> 00:18:41.954
Ginko, how did this...?
Who put this chain here?

00:18:41.996 --> 00:18:43.998
It was another <i>mushi</i> master.

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:45.708
This pathway's
been used as a shortcut

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:48.169
by <i>mushi</i> masters for years.

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:50.588
It's been said that
some of them stayed too long

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:54.800
and lost their memories,
so I don't use it much.

00:19:08.898 --> 00:19:10.691
[gasps]

00:19:13.736 --> 00:19:17.365
[GINKO] Hey, what's the matter?
Aren't you coming?

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.294
[GINKO]
Of all these passageways,

00:19:30.336 --> 00:19:32.380
they say the one with
the chain is the only one

00:19:32.421 --> 00:19:36.300
that leads back
to the outside world.

00:19:36.342 --> 00:19:38.260
As for all of the others?

00:19:38.302 --> 00:19:40.971
They connect to enclosed
spaces somewhere

00:19:41.013 --> 00:19:44.141
and can't be opened
from the inside.

00:19:44.183 --> 00:19:46.227
This is just one cavern.

00:19:46.268 --> 00:19:49.772
There are thousands
of others just like it.

00:19:49.814 --> 00:19:51.857
Do you understand now?

00:19:51.899 --> 00:19:54.151
The chances that your sister
even passed through here

00:19:54.193 --> 00:19:57.196
are slim.
I'm sorry, Aya.

00:19:59.407 --> 00:20:01.575
But you're never
going to find her,

00:20:01.617 --> 00:20:04.787
no matter what you do.

00:20:04.829 --> 00:20:07.790
Aya. Let her go.

00:20:12.628 --> 00:20:15.297
[GINKO] You've had a hole
in your heart for too long.

00:20:15.339 --> 00:20:18.968
Close it
and start living again.

00:20:19.009 --> 00:20:21.554
Ito would want you to.

00:20:43.701 --> 00:20:48.664
[rustling]

00:20:48.706 --> 00:20:51.208
Ito? Is that you?

00:21:14.482 --> 00:21:21.113
[footsteps]

00:21:28.245 --> 00:21:30.581
[NARRATOR]
Several years later,

00:21:30.623 --> 00:21:33.125
a strange tale
began to circulate

00:21:33.167 --> 00:21:36.337
about a certain
silk-producing village.

00:21:36.378 --> 00:21:41.592
It was an ordinary day,
and weaving had just begun...

00:21:44.094 --> 00:21:47.181
[screams]

00:21:47.223 --> 00:21:49.225
[NARRATOR] ...when a girl
suddenly emerged

00:21:49.266 --> 00:21:51.393
from a tiny cocoon.

00:21:51.435 --> 00:21:54.271
A girl who appeared
to be ten years of age

00:21:54.313 --> 00:21:57.149
and could not
speak a single word.

00:21:57.191 --> 00:21:59.360
[OLD WOMAN] Wh-Where
did you come from?!

00:21:59.401 --> 00:22:03.906
Somebody! Come here! Quick!

00:22:03.948 --> 00:22:07.993
[NARRATOR] Later, she was
returned to her home village,

00:22:08.035 --> 00:22:10.496
whose name and location
were on the letter

00:22:10.538 --> 00:22:12.665
in her breast pocket.

00:23:48.427 --> 00:23:51.680
[NARRATOR] Next: "Clothes
that Embrace the Mountain."
