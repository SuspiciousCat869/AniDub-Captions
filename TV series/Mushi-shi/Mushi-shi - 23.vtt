A strange sound echoing through
the icy air of these hills.

[GINKO] So when did the illness
first appear in this town?

00:03:22.244 --> 00:03:24.830
I'd say It was about
14 years ago.

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:27.916
Since then, those afflicted
complain about their skin.

00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.919
It appears healthy, but is
unnaturally hard in places.

00:03:30.961 --> 00:03:34.673
There's also a loss of
mobility in the arms and legs.

00:03:34.715 --> 00:03:36.299
Many suffer from it.

00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:39.469
By far, the worst case
is an old friend of mine.

He's so far gone that he
can't even get up anymore.

on the western edge of town.

Their daughter

The townspeople believe that
she is the cause of the illness.

Her name is Shige.

Ever since she was born,

I know that may sound strange,
but it's the truth.

For the past 14 years,

00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:13.211
we've desperately tried to
find the cause of all this,

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:16.548

tired of it, do they?

You should give them a
piece of your mind sometime.

Those rumors are
all lies, right?

About two years ago,
a storm destroyed my village.

Most of my family and

such a tiny body.

up the way it is now.

sweet and elegant overtones.

[SHIGE]
Whenever I spoke,

00:08:32.178 --> 00:08:35.098
rust would form on the
people and things around me.

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:36.516
It's all I'd ever known,

00:08:36.558 --> 00:08:38.935
so I thought it was just
the way things were,

00:08:38.977 --> 00:08:41.021
that it was the
same for everyone.

00:08:41.062 --> 00:08:42.063
Hey, Shige.

00:08:42.105 --> 00:08:44.482
Why don't you sing for me?

00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:47.652
[SHIGE] People always asked
me to sing, so I would.

00:08:47.694 --> 00:08:51.072
It seemed like a perfectly
normal thing to do.

00:08:51.114 --> 00:08:55.660
Eventually, I noticed that no
one else could see the rust.

00:08:55.702 --> 00:08:58.747
I was four when I first realized
that it was something bad.

00:08:58.788 --> 00:09:00.707
Everyone around me
started having trouble

00:09:00.749 --> 00:09:02.584
moving their bodies.

00:09:04.085 --> 00:09:07.005
[SHIGE] I decided to tell my
mother and father about it.

00:09:08.339 --> 00:09:10.592
Shige, promise me.

00:09:10.633 --> 00:09:13.178
You'll never tell
anyone else about this.

00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:16.681
If you do, we won't
be able to stay here.

00:09:16.723 --> 00:09:19.434
Your mother and I
can't work anymore.

00:09:19.476 --> 00:09:22.604
We're only able to get by
because of the generosity

00:09:22.645 --> 00:09:25.774
shown to us by the master
at the main house.

00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:28.693
For now,

00:09:28.735 --> 00:09:31.321
we'll keep this a secret,
and remain here,

00:09:31.362 --> 00:09:33.907
and accept their charity.

00:09:33.948 --> 00:09:36.951
The day will come
when we can repay them.

00:09:36.993 --> 00:09:40.538
Until then, you must
never use your voice.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.415
I'm sorry, Shige.

00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:46.127
[SHIGE]
Since that day,

00:09:46.169 --> 00:09:48.963
I haven't spoken
a word to anyone.

00:09:49.005 --> 00:09:52.342
That was ten years ago.

00:09:52.383 --> 00:09:56.179
Everyone here should despise
me for what I've done,

00:09:56.221 --> 00:09:58.640
and for what I continue
to do by remaining here

00:09:58.681 --> 00:10:01.309
with my family
instead of leaving.

00:10:01.351 --> 00:10:02.435
Interesting.

00:10:02.477 --> 00:10:06.564
The sounds I hear when
you speak. They're intriguing.

00:10:06.606 --> 00:10:09.609
I'm not even sure
how you make them.

00:10:09.651 --> 00:10:11.277
Human vocal chords normally

00:10:11.319 --> 00:10:13.947
can't produce those
types of overtones.

00:10:15.323 --> 00:10:15.740
Of course,

00:10:15.782 --> 00:10:19.035
I suspect I hear your voice
a bit differently than most.

00:10:19.077 --> 00:10:22.831
As it happens, I know of another
sound with similar qualities.

00:10:22.872 --> 00:10:25.291
This isn't rust.

00:10:25.333 --> 00:10:29.671
It's a <i>mushi</i> called the
<i>"yasabi"</i> and it's alive.

00:10:29.712 --> 00:10:31.548
A <i>mushi?</i>

00:10:31.589 --> 00:10:34.384
Some can see them,
other people cannot.

00:10:34.425 --> 00:10:36.469
They are a different
form of life.

00:10:36.511 --> 00:10:38.721
The <i>yasabi</i> are normally
harmless <i>mushi</i>

00:10:38.763 --> 00:10:41.182
that attach themselves to
the bodies of dead animals

00:10:41.224 --> 00:10:42.976
and help with
their decomposition.

00:10:43.017 --> 00:10:46.062
During this process,
they create a specific sound.

00:10:46.104 --> 00:10:48.523
Your voice contains
this same sound,

00:10:48.565 --> 00:10:50.733
only amplified
several hundredfold.

00:10:50.775 --> 00:10:53.611
Upon hearing it, the <i>yasabi</i>
come down from the mountains

00:10:53.653 --> 00:10:55.989
and gather here,
believing there to be food.

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:58.241
But, because they find none,
they attach themselves

00:10:58.283 --> 00:11:01.327
on to anything,
including living beings.

00:11:01.369 --> 00:11:03.997
The solution is to scatter them.

00:11:04.038 --> 00:11:06.082
[gasps]
Is that possible?

00:11:06.124 --> 00:11:09.002
[GINKO] Yes. And beyond that,
there should be a way

00:11:09.043 --> 00:11:11.629
to return your voice
to normal, as well.

00:11:25.977 --> 00:11:28.396
They're on everything.

00:11:28.438 --> 00:11:30.648
Not too picky, are they?

00:11:38.907 --> 00:11:42.118
This entire town is covered
with that rust color.

Why are you sitting in the snow?

00:11:52.837 --> 00:11:54.547
Uh, no reason.

00:11:54.589 --> 00:11:56.299
[GINKO]
I see...

00:11:56.341 --> 00:11:58.551
You're not afraid
of Shige, are you?

00:11:58.593 --> 00:12:02.305
No, I've only lived in
this town for two years.

00:12:02.347 --> 00:12:03.848
So I guess I've
never really believed

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:07.185
that Shige is the
cause of the illness.

00:12:07.227 --> 00:12:08.019
See ya'.

00:12:08.061 --> 00:12:09.896

00:12:11.814 --> 00:12:13.650
<i>yasabi</i> on him.

00:12:16.653 --> 00:12:19.072
[GINKO] You can see
the ocean from here.

00:12:25.328 --> 00:12:27.622
[GINKO]
Wait! Could it be?

00:12:37.674 --> 00:12:39.425
I thought so.

00:12:43.346 --> 00:12:45.181
[SHIGE exhales]

00:12:48.017 --> 00:12:50.603
[SHIGE] If everyone's
illness can be cured,

00:12:50.645 --> 00:12:53.815
and I can finally speak again...

00:12:53.856 --> 00:12:56.776
... I can thank Tetsu.

00:12:56.818 --> 00:13:00.154
I can thank him for
everything with my own voice.

00:13:03.199 --> 00:13:03.950
[SHIGE]
What?

00:13:03.992 --> 00:13:05.118
[GINKO]
That's right.

00:13:05.159 --> 00:13:08.413
We're going to use your voice
to get rid of the Mushi.

00:13:08.454 --> 00:13:11.958
But then, after that,
for everyone's safety,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.168
you're going to have
to leave this town.

00:13:17.213 --> 00:13:18.631
[SHIGE]
I understand.

00:13:18.673 --> 00:13:22.385
I'll do anything I can to
help cure this illness.

00:13:22.427 --> 00:13:23.761
But...

00:13:23.803 --> 00:13:24.929
[GINKO]
Hm?

00:13:24.971 --> 00:13:27.265
[SHIGE]
Can I ask a favor of you?

00:13:29.267 --> 00:13:32.061
[SHIGE] I'd like you to
teach me how to write.

00:13:34.981 --> 00:13:36.858
Huh? Hey there.

00:13:42.613 --> 00:13:44.824
Oh yeah. My handkerchief.

00:13:44.866 --> 00:13:46.034
Thank you.

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.369
[TETSU]
Hey!

00:13:52.749 --> 00:13:53.624
[BOSS]
What?!

00:13:53.666 --> 00:13:55.918
You've found
what's causing this?

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.087
Is it... Shige?

00:13:58.129 --> 00:14:01.674
No. That was nothing
more than a rumor.

00:14:04.302 --> 00:14:07.472
[TETSU]
Wait. No. This way?

00:14:08.973 --> 00:14:10.475
Here, I'll read it for you.

00:14:10.516 --> 00:14:12.643
No! Give that back!

00:14:12.685 --> 00:14:17.148
"If I talk... you will get sick,
just like the others?"

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:20.902
"I'm sorry? Thank you
for everything"?

00:14:20.943 --> 00:14:22.779
Tetsu! Who wrote this?!

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:24.822
Tell me! Was it Shige?!

00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:26.866
I told you! Give it back!

00:14:26.908 --> 00:14:28.034
[MAID]
No...

00:14:28.076 --> 00:14:30.912
You've always been
sympathetic towards her.

00:14:30.953 --> 00:14:32.663
It has to be Shige!

00:14:32.705 --> 00:14:34.248
I'm going to show this
to the master--

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:35.291
[TETSU]
No! You can't!

00:14:35.333 --> 00:14:36.751
[MAID grunts]

00:14:36.793 --> 00:14:39.212
[FEMALE SERVANT A]
Tetsu! What are you doing?!

00:14:40.421 --> 00:14:42.256
[SERVANTS gasp]

00:14:42.298 --> 00:14:44.175
I'm sorry about all this.

00:14:45.593 --> 00:14:46.260
[MALE SERVANT A]
Tetsu!

00:14:46.302 --> 00:14:48.012
[MAID]
No! Don't chase him!

00:14:48.054 --> 00:14:49.931
Hurry! Get that out of the fire!

00:14:49.972 --> 00:14:51.224
[MALE SERVANT A]
Right!

00:14:51.265 --> 00:14:52.517
[MAID]
Damn that girl!

00:14:52.558 --> 00:14:55.186
I won't let her play
innocent any longer!

00:14:59.816 --> 00:15:01.275
[TETSU]
Shige!

00:15:01.317 --> 00:15:02.944
You've got to run away, Shige!

00:15:02.985 --> 00:15:06.948
Now! They'll all be
coming for you soon.

00:15:06.989 --> 00:15:09.909
There's no way of knowing
what they might do to you.

00:15:12.036 --> 00:15:14.664
[SHIGE]
I can't! Not yet!

00:15:14.705 --> 00:15:17.959
Ginko hasn't shown me how
to chase away the Mushi.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.294
I won't go!

00:15:20.336 --> 00:15:21.504
[GINKO]
Shige!

00:15:21.546 --> 00:15:23.673
You've got to get out of here!

00:15:23.714 --> 00:15:25.800
Wait for me over there,
at that ridge.

00:15:25.842 --> 00:15:27.552
After I get these
people under control,

00:15:27.593 --> 00:15:30.721
I'll meet you there and tell you
how to get rid of the <i>mushi.</i>

00:15:30.763 --> 00:15:32.223
I'll go too.

00:15:32.265 --> 00:15:34.809
I can't stay in this
town any longer.

00:15:34.851 --> 00:15:37.854
That ridge is in the same
direction as my old village.

00:15:37.895 --> 00:15:39.230
It's dangerous to--

00:15:39.272 --> 00:15:41.858
Thought you'd say that.

00:15:41.899 --> 00:15:43.693
You can do it. Go.

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:55.830
Ginko, why?

00:15:55.872 --> 00:15:57.623
Why are you protecting Shige?

00:15:57.665 --> 00:15:58.958
Bring her to us!

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.169
[MALE VILLAGER B] She has
to pay for what she's done!

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:04.380
Getting rid of Shige is not
going to cure the illness.

00:16:04.422 --> 00:16:06.799
It's not her fault.

00:16:06.841 --> 00:16:10.678
All she did was talk,
laugh, and sing,

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:13.431
just like any other
child would do.

00:16:13.473 --> 00:16:16.642
It's her voice. It contains
a unique sound element.

00:16:16.684 --> 00:16:18.811
That's what attracted
the illness here.

00:16:18.853 --> 00:16:21.189
We don't give a damn
about what the reason is!

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:22.899
She's the one
that caused this!

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:25.651
How is she going to repay us?

00:16:25.693 --> 00:16:27.236
She's been repaying you.

00:16:27.278 --> 00:16:28.279
Silently.

00:16:28.321 --> 00:16:30.656
For the past ten years.

00:16:30.698 --> 00:16:34.368
If she had broken her silence
and made up some sort of excuse,

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:36.662
I'm sure she would have
been able to deceive you.

00:16:36.704 --> 00:16:40.750
Instead, she carried
the weight of her sin.

00:16:40.791 --> 00:16:43.002
That doesn't mean we
should forgive her!

00:16:43.044 --> 00:16:43.961
My child...

00:16:44.003 --> 00:16:46.631
She's the same age as Shige
and she can't even walk!

00:16:46.672 --> 00:16:48.216
My child's the same way!

00:16:48.257 --> 00:16:51.177
Look. I'm helping
her to make amends.

00:16:51.219 --> 00:16:53.179
If it's her voice that
brought the illness,

00:16:53.221 --> 00:16:55.598
it's her voice that
can take it away.

00:16:57.058 --> 00:16:59.185
[GINKO] Wouldn't that
make things even?

00:16:59.227 --> 00:17:01.854
Everyone who's been
afflicted with this illness

00:17:01.896 --> 00:17:04.273
has shared the same pain.

00:17:15.034 --> 00:17:17.537
[TETSU]
Shige, about that letter...

00:17:17.578 --> 00:17:19.080
The way it was written
led me to believe

00:17:19.121 --> 00:17:20.873
you were going to leave town.

00:17:20.915 --> 00:17:24.460
Do you still plan on doing that,
even if this sickness is cured?

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:27.880
[TETSU]
Do you know where you'll go?

00:17:29.131 --> 00:17:30.883
Well, would you
like to come with me,

00:17:30.925 --> 00:17:32.885
and live in my village?

00:17:32.927 --> 00:17:36.430
Now, Most of the houses and
boats there were swept away,

00:17:36.472 --> 00:17:39.600
but everything is
slowly being rebuilt.

00:17:39.642 --> 00:17:40.851
You should come!

00:17:40.893 --> 00:17:42.687
So what do you say?

00:17:51.279 --> 00:17:52.572
[TETSU]
Shige!

00:18:08.462 --> 00:18:10.214
[GINKO]
They're not here.

00:18:10.256 --> 00:18:12.049
Did something happen?

00:18:28.649 --> 00:18:30.693
[SHIGE]
I need to call for help.

00:18:30.735 --> 00:18:32.653
But, my voice...

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:39.243
[SHIGE]
Maybe... from this distance...

00:18:39.285 --> 00:18:41.704
[GINKO]
This illness can be cured.

00:18:44.081 --> 00:18:46.208
[GINKO]
Shige!

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:49.045
Tetsu!

00:18:49.086 --> 00:18:52.214
--[SHIGE screams]
--[GINKO gasps]

00:18:59.555 --> 00:19:03.017
[GINKO] That unmistakable voice
echoed through the mountains.

00:19:03.059 --> 00:19:08.105
[screams continues]

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:21.535
[SHIGE'S FATHER gasps]

00:19:21.577 --> 00:19:24.121
My legs... feel... lighter!

00:19:24.163 --> 00:19:25.790
[SHIGE'S MOTHER gasps]
So do mine!

00:19:36.258 --> 00:19:38.219
Hey! Shige!

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:39.595
Are you two all right?

00:19:39.637 --> 00:19:42.098
[sobs]

00:19:42.139 --> 00:19:43.683
Tetsu, I'm sorry.

00:19:43.724 --> 00:19:45.101
So sorry.

00:19:45.142 --> 00:19:46.686
What have I done?

00:19:46.727 --> 00:19:48.646
Now you're sick, too.

00:19:48.688 --> 00:19:53.693
[sobbing continues]

00:19:54.819 --> 00:19:57.029
No, he's just unconscious.

00:19:57.071 --> 00:19:58.072
Don't worry.

00:19:58.114 --> 00:20:00.533
I promise he won't
get the illness.

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.042
[gasps]
Shige!

00:20:10.084 --> 00:20:11.669
You're all right!

00:20:11.711 --> 00:20:13.921
Look! Our legs!

00:20:16.882 --> 00:20:18.384
[GINKO]
As it turned out,

00:20:18.426 --> 00:20:20.344
you did something that
was very similar

00:20:20.386 --> 00:20:23.973
to what I had in mind
from the beginning.

00:20:24.014 --> 00:20:26.183
The plan I devised was
to have your voice

00:20:26.225 --> 00:20:27.685
echo through the mountains,

00:20:27.727 --> 00:20:29.979
Which would cause the
yasabi gathered in this town

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:32.064
to disperse.

00:20:32.106 --> 00:20:33.774
But the location
you called out from

00:20:33.816 --> 00:20:36.485
had to be that ridge where
I'd told you to meet me,

00:20:36.527 --> 00:20:38.654
with the view of
the ocean behind it.

00:20:38.696 --> 00:20:42.658
<i>Yasabi</i> dislike salt
and saltwater.

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:44.118
The rust at the edge of town,

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:46.203
closest to where the
ocean breeze blows in,

00:20:46.245 --> 00:20:48.414
wasn't the <i>yasabi.</i>

00:20:48.456 --> 00:20:50.416
It was plain rust.

00:20:50.458 --> 00:20:52.084
The reason Tetsu
never got sick,

00:20:52.126 --> 00:20:54.378
was because he was
from a fishing village.

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:57.047
Even after he came here,
he continued to be exposed

00:20:57.089 --> 00:20:57.965
to the sea breeze

00:20:58.007 --> 00:21:00.217
while going back and
forth to his old village.

00:21:00.259 --> 00:21:01.677
If you live near the sea,

00:21:01.719 --> 00:21:04.722
you can have a
normal life, as well.

00:21:04.764 --> 00:21:06.849
But you've only scattered
a small fraction

00:21:06.891 --> 00:21:08.684
of the <i>mushi</i> in this town.

00:21:08.726 --> 00:21:11.312
You'll have to repeat
this again and again

00:21:11.353 --> 00:21:14.565
for decades in order to
get rid of all of them.

00:21:14.607 --> 00:21:18.194
You might even wear your
voice out before it's done.

00:21:20.321 --> 00:21:25.117
Everything considered,
I don't think I'd mind that.

00:21:25.159 --> 00:21:28.788
[SHIGE] Although they're vague,
I do have memories of this place

00:21:28.829 --> 00:21:32.500
before there was any rust here.

00:21:32.541 --> 00:21:34.376
Back in those days,

00:21:34.418 --> 00:21:37.129
I really loved this
simple little town.

00:21:38.798 --> 00:21:40.132
[SHIGE]
I'll do anything I can

00:21:40.174 --> 00:21:42.593
to bring it back to
the way it was.

00:21:45.346 --> 00:21:47.264
[GINKO]
After the girl left town,

00:21:47.306 --> 00:21:51.018
it's said that the sickness
slowly went away.

00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:53.771
[TETSU]
Shige!

00:21:53.813 --> 00:21:55.189
You headed up to the ridge?

00:21:55.231 --> 00:21:56.315
[SHIGE]
Mm-hm.

00:21:56.357 --> 00:21:57.775
[TETSU]
I'll join you.

00:21:58.984 --> 00:22:01.904
[GINKO] Even now, the people
of that town say they

00:22:01.946 --> 00:22:06.075
can still hear a voice calling
out somewhere in the distance.

00:22:06.116 --> 00:22:11.121
A strange, hoarse,
yet familiar and lovely voice,

00:22:11.163 --> 00:22:13.374
