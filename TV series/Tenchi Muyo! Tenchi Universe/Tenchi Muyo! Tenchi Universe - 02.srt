29
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,250
- Kamidake: PRINCESS AYEKA,
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT?

30
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:33,583
- Azaka:
THE MARRIAGE MEETING

31
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:37,291
SEEMS TO HAVE EXHAUSTED YOU,
PRINCESS AYEKA.

32
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:39,625
MAY I SUGGEST YOU
HAVE SOME REST

33
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:42,208
BEFORE WE ARRIVE
AT PLANET JURAI?

34
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:44,583
- AS SOON I RETURN 
TO TO PLANET JURAI,

35
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:48,250
I'LL HAVE TO DEPART FOR ANOTHER
MARRIAGE MEETING, WON'T I?

36
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:52,541
- Kamidake: YES, PRINCESS, BUT--
- I KNOW, YES, IT IS MY DUTY

37
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:55,500
AS THE FIRST PRINCESS 
OF JURAI ROYAL FAMILY.

38
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:01,458
YES, I KNOW IT
TOO WELL.

39
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,833
- ( man howls )

40
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:12,833
- HEY, TENCHI. COME ON,
TENCHI, LET'S GO PLAY.

41
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:14,583
YOUR SILLY CHORES
ARE BORING.

42
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:16,875
- ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S ENOUGH.

43
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:20,416
YOU KNOW GRANDPA'S VERY FUSSY
ABOUT KEEPING THE SHRINE CLEAN.

44
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,125
- ( hums )

45
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:24,875
- HUH?

46
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:26,916
MIHOSHI, WHAT IS THAT THING?

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,125
- A SPECIAL DEVICE
MADE EXCLUSIVELY

48
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,250
FOR THE GALAXY POLICE.

49
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:33,583
YOU TURN IT THIS WAY
AND THAT WAY.

50
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:36,708
THERE!  I CAN SEND OUT
A DISTRESS SIGNAL NOW.

51
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,250
- WE'RE IN THE BOONIES, KIDDO.

52
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:40,125
CAN YOU REALLY COUNT
ON A TOY LIKE THAT? 

53
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:42,250
- ACCORDING TO 
THE STATISTICS,

54
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:45,166
ONE CASE IN 200 YEARS
IS REPORTED TO RESULT

55
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,833
IN SUCCESSFUL RESCUE.

56
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:49,291
- YEAH, RIGHT.
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

57
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:51,791
- ( gong rings )
- ( whimpers )

58
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,958
( cries )
WELL, IT'S BETTER THAN

59
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:56,791
JUST SITTING AROUND
HERE DOING NOTHING!

60
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:59,250
- EH?
- WHAT IS IT AZAKA?

61
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:00,791
- PRINCESS AYEKA,

62
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,625
WE ARE PICKING UP 
A DISTRESS SIGNAL.

63
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:04,625
- REALLY? FROM WHERE?

64
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:06,125
- JUST A MOMENT.
I'LL FIND OUT.

65
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:09,833
FROM THE THIRD PLANET
OF A NEARBY SOLAR SYSTEM.

66
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,583
- WELL, WE CAN'T JUST IGNORE IT,
I GUESS.

67
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:16,583
WE HAVE SOME TIME LEFT

68
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:19,458
BEFORE OUR SCHEDULED RENDEZVOUS
WITH SASAMI, DON'T WE?

69
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,166
- YES, YOUR HIGHNESS.

70
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,500
- HEAD FOR THAT PLANET.
LET'S GO.

71
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:25,291
- YES, MA'AM.
- YES, MA'AM.

72
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:37,708
- HUH?

73
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,083
- WHAT THE HECK?
- UH-OH.

74
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:48,166
- HOORAY!  HERE I AM.
I'M RIGHT HERE.

75
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:51,166
YAHOO!

76
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:55,833
- HMM, THAT SPACESHIP
LOOKS AWFULLY FAMILIAR.

77
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:58,000
LET'S WAIT AND SEE.

78
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:07,375
- I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU.

79
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,708
YAHOO!
( giggles )

80
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,375
OH.
- HUH?

81
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,541
- ( giggles )
- ARGH!

82
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:27,750
- MMM?

83
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:29,958
- HUH?

84
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,375
- Both: YOU?!
IT CAN'T BE! 

85
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:33,500
- WHAT?
- WHAT?

86
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,458
- SO YOU'RE STILL ALIVE,
MISS RYOKO.

87
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:40,708
THOSE GALAXY POLICE HAVE BECOME
SO INCOMPETENT THESE DAYS.

88
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:42,625
- AND I THOUGHT
THIS PLANET WAS REMOTE,

89
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,291
BUT HERE YOU ARE.

90
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:46,916
WHAT? HAS JURAI ROYAL FAMILY
FALLEN OR SOMETHING?

91
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
ARE YOU IN EXILE?

92
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:50,916
- ( growls )
( laughs )

93
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,250
YOU'RE SUCH A JOKER.

94
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,416
YOU KNOW JURAI'S ROYAL FAMILY
WILL LAST FOREVER.

95
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,708
WE'RE EVERLASTING.

96
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:58,583
- WHAT? JURAI'S ROYAL FAMILY
IS NEVER-LASTING?

97
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:01,583
- EVERLASTING!
- WELL, ISN'T THAT TOO BAD.

98
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:05,958
- OH, UH, EXCUSE ME.
YOU TWO KNOW EACH OTHER?

99
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:08,958
- THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR COMING TO RESCUE ME.

100
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,083
YOU SEE,
I'M THE ONE

101
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,291
WHO SENT OUT
THE DISTRESS SIGNAL AND...

102
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:14,416
HELLO, EXCUSE ME.

103
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,666
- YOU MEAN, I CAME ALL THIS WAY
TO RESCUE SOMEONE

104
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:22,625
ONLY TO MEET A LOWLY DISGUSTING
CREATURE LIKE YOU?!

105
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:23,916
- YEAH, WELL, I NEVER
ASKED YOU TO COME,

106
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,458
YOUR ROYAL LOWNESS.

107
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:28,500
- WELL, YES, THAT'S RIGHT.
IT WAS ME WHO ASKED YOU TO COME.

108
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:30,291
- HOW UNPLEASANT!

109
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:32,208
AZAKA, KAMIDAKE,
WE ARE LEAVING! 

110
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:33,416
- Both: YES, MA'AM.

111
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,333
- YEAH, GREAT.
GET OUT OF HERE.

112
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:37,500
- NOW, WAIT A MINUTE.
SHE'S MY RIDE OUT OF HERE.

113
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:39,875
- GOOD RIDDANCE
TO BAD RUBBISH.

114
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:41,750
- J-- HEY!
- HMPH!

115
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:43,625
RESCUE,
WHAT A WASTE OF MY TIME.

116
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:45,000
- NO, WAIT!
DON'T GO!

117
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:48,625
( gasps ) OH PLEASE 
DON'T LEAVE, PLEASE!

118
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,583
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

119
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:53,833
- I'M IN DISTRESS.
I TOLD YOU.

120
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:55,750
- ALL RIGHT, LET GO NOW.

121
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:59,791
- PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME.
DON'T GO.  DON'T GO.

122
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,333
- ( both whine )

123
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:04,833
- ALL RIGHT!
NOW JUST LET ME GO!

124
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:07,000
- PLEASE HELP YOURSELF.

125
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:10,333
- ( sipping )

126
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:14,291
- SO YOU COME FROM A PLANET
CALLED JURAI, DID YOU SAY? 

127
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:15,791
- THAT'S RIGHT.

128
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:18,208
- I WONDER, COULD YOU TELL ME
ABOUT YOUR PLANET?

129
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:20,291
TELL ME ABOUT JURAI,

130
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,708
ABOUT ITS MOUNTAINS,
VALLEYS,

131
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:25,000
ITS PEOPLE AND PLANTS.

132
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,791
- WELL, YES.

133
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:29,041
- YOU JUST CAN'T
BE SO RUDE TO HER.

134
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:31,375
SHE CAME HERE
TO RESCUE MIHOSHI.

135
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:34,750
- TENCHI'S RIGHT.
SHE ALMOST LEFT ME HERE

136
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:36,958
AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF YOU.

137
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,333
- NOW, LISTEN.

138
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,916
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND
OF WITCH SHE REALLY IS. 

139
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,250
- COULD YOU PLEASE
WORK ON YOUR ATTITUDE?

140
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,791
- HOW DO YOU HAPPEN
TO KNOW EACH OTHER, ANYWAY?

141
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:47,833
A PRINCESS OF
JURAI'S ROYAL FAMILY

142
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:49,916
AND A MOST-WANTED CRIMINAL?

143
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
- IT WAS WHEN-- YES.

144
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:54,916
WHEN I WAS JUST
A YOUNG INNOCENT CHILD.

145
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:00,250
I WAS PLAYING IN A FLOWER FIELD
ON A PLANET.

146
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:04,625
SO MANY FLOWERS
AND SO MANY COLORS ALL IN BLOOM.

147
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:07,541
( sighs ) IT WAS SO PRETTY.

148
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:10,333
- HEY, YOU!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?!

149
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:11,708
- HUH?

150
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,875
- THIS PLANET IS JURAI
ROYAL FAMILY'S TERRITORY.

151
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:17,916
JUST WHO GAVE YOU THE PERMISSION
TO PLAY AROUND HERE?

152
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,083
- BUT I WAS JUST--

153
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,791
- YOU BETTER
GET OUT OF HERE AND QUICK.

154
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:26,708
- OKAY.
- NOPE.

155
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:29,541
- ( gasps) 
- YOU CAN'T TAKE THOSE WITH YOU.

156
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:31,333
- BUT I--
- DON'T BUT ME.

157
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:34,041
I TOLD YOU THIS PLANET
IS ROYAL FAMILY TERRITORY.

158
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,500
AND EVERY SINGLE 
THING THAT'S HERE

159
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,250
BELONGS TO ROYAL ME.

160
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,416
- YOU'RE MEAN.

161
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,666
- ( laughs )

162
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:45,583
- THAT WAS MY VERY FIRST
ENCOUNTER WITH AYEKA.

163
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:48,958
- WHAT A TERRIBLE STORY.

164
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:50,583
NOW I UNDERSTAND, RYOKO.

165
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:53,416
THAT WOUND IN YOUR YOUNG HEART
REMAINS FOREVER.

166
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,583
( gasps )

167
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:57,083
- YOU DO UNDERSTAND, MIHOSHI.

168
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:59,666
- OH, YES, NOW I KNOW
WHAT CAUSED YOU

169
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,083
TO STRAY IN THE FIRST PLACE.

170
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,208
SO YOU BECAME
A JUVENILE DELINQUENT

171
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:04,916
AND WENT DOWN
THE PATH OF EVIL.

172
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,791
OH, WHAT A PITY. I'M SO
SORRY FOR YOU, SO SORRY!

173
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:15,291
- I SEE. JURAI SOUNDS LIKE
A VERY BEAUTIFUL PLANET.

174
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:17,416
- IT IS.

175
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:21,125
AND I MUST KEEP AND CARRY ON THE
TRADITION OF JURAI AT ALL COSTS.

176
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:22,916
I'VE SWORN TO DO SO...

177
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:28,291
AT ALL COSTS,
EVEN IF--

178
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:29,958
- HMM.

179
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:32,916
WHO IS IT?

180
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,833
AH, IT'S YOU, TENCHI.

181
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:39,500
- YES, I BROUGHT
SOME TEA CAKE FOR YOU.

182
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:43,166
- VERY GOOD.
YOU'RE JUST IN TIME, TENCHI.

183
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,750
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE MISS AYEKA
AND SHOW HER AROUND.

184
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,083
- HUH?

185
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:49,375
- THE MOUNTAINS AND FIELDS
ON THIS PLANET

186
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:52,041
HAVE THEIR OWN CHARM,
THOUGH DIFFERENT FROM JURAI'S,

187
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,750
ESPECIALLY NOW.

188
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:56,791
THIS TIME OF YEAR,
THEY'RE QUITE SOMETHING TO SEE.

189
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,500
- BUT...

190
00:09:58,583 --> 00:09:59,750
- IT'S ALL
WELL AND GOOD

191
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:02,000
TO LIVE FOR
THE DUTIES OF A PRINCESS,

192
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:03,625
BUT THAT DOESN'T
MEAN YOU CAN'T HAVE

193
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:05,958
A DAY OFF FROM TIME TO TIME.

194
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:07,916
WHATEVER LUCK
BROUGHT YOU TO THIS PLANET,

195
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,833
YOU SHOULD TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF IT

196
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:11,208
AND TRY TO RELAX.

197
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:14,166
FORGET ALL YOUR WORRIES
JUST FOR TODAY.

198
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,583
GOT IT, TENCHI?

199
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:18,083
- UH, YEAH.

200
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:20,333
- ( sighs )

201
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:33,166
LOVELY.

202
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,083
- YOU THINK SO?

203
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:36,541
- YES.

204
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:39,041
- WELL, I GUESS
THIS IS THE SEASON

205
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,458
WHEN THESE HILLS
LOOK THEIR BEST,

206
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:41,916
BUT THEY'RE JUST PLAIN HILLS.

207
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,416
- OH NO. THEY DEFINITELY
HAVE A BEAUTY,

208
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,958
A DIFFERENT KIND OF BEAUTY
FROM WHAT I SEE ON JURAI. 

209
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:50,625
- HM-HMM.
YOU KNOW, IT'S INTERESTING.

210
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:53,125
WE DON'T SEEM TO
BE ABLE TO REALIZE

211
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:55,291
THE BEAUTY
OR HAPPINESS WE DO HAVE,

212
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:58,375
EVEN WHEN WE'RE RIGHT THERE
SMACK DAB IN THE MIDDLE OF IT.

213
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:04,208
WELL, SHALL WE START BACK NOW?
- YES.

214
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:06,333
OH. ( gasps )

215
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,125
- ARE-- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

216
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,541
- OH?

217
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:19,416
- ( birds twitter )
- ( sighs )

218
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,625
- ( both gasp ) 
- OH, EXCUSE ME.

219
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:23,125
- EXCUSE ME.

220
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:25,583
- TENCHI? TENCHI?

221
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:28,583
- TENCHI? NO, I DON'T KNOW.

222
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:33,458
- TENCHI, WHERE ARE YOU?
TENCHI!

223
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,916
RATS!

224
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,333
COULD IT BE AYEKA?

225
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:55,166
- I HAVE NEVER FELT LIKE THIS
IN MY LIFE.

226
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:58,166
- WHAT? DID YOU SAY SOMETHING?

227
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,875
- OH, NO.

228
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:01,958
- WELL, THERE'S A NICE
LITTLE SPOT UP THERE. 

229
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:03,208
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO CHECK IT OUT?

230
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:04,625
- YES.

231
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:27,000
- HOW DO YOU LIKE IT?
ISN'T IT A WONDERFUL VIEW?

232
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:34,291
- ( cries )

233
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:36,041
- OH.

234
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:38,125
WHAT IS IT, AYEKA?
WHAT'S WRONG?

235
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:40,166
- IT'S NOTHING.

236
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,708
JUST THAT YOUR GRANDFATHER
WAS PROBABLY RIGHT.

237
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:48,666
THIS HAS TURNED OUT TO BE
THE MOST PERFECT DAY OFF FOR ME.

238
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,875
JUST PERFECT.

239
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:01,000
- Ryoko: THERE,
I FOUND YOU.

240
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,708
- HUH?
- HUH?

241
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:05,791
- AND JUST WHERE HAVE YOU TWO
BEEN HIDING ALL THIS TIME?

242
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:08,333
- WHAT? WE WENT
OUT FOR A WALK.

243
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:12,125
- AND YOU! HOW DARE YOU FLIRT
WITH TENCHI LIKE THIS, HUH.

244
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,916
- FLIRT? ARE YOU ADDRESSING ME?
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT IDEA?

245
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,666
- UH-HUH.  SO YOU'RE TELLING ME
YOU WEREN'T FLIRTING?

246
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,333
- WELL, OF COURSE NOT.

247
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:24,000
I WAS CERTAINLY NOT FLIRTING,
GUTTER BRAIN!

248
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:26,791
- OH, YOU LIE.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

249
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,666
I'M NOT GOING TO
LET THAT ONE PASS.

250
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,375
- OKAY, OKAY.
ENOUGH YOU TWO.

251
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,625
- YES, RYOKO.

252
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:35,416
WE NEED TO START MAKING
ARRANGEMENTS TO GET BACK HOME.

253
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,916
- LORD TENCHI,
PLEASE LISTEN TO ME.

254
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,916
YOU MUST LISTEN
AND LISTEN CAREFULLY.

255
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,458
- THAT CREATURE CALLED RYOKO
IS BAD THROUGH-AND-THROUGH. 

256
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:45,375
SHE ALWAYS HAS BEEN.

257
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,875
- YEAH, WELL, SHE'S
NOT MY FAVORITE ALIEN.

258
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:50,541
- IT ALL HAPPENED--
YES, IT ALL HAPPENED

259
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,541
WHEN I WAS VERY
YOUNG AND TENDER.

260
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:55,041
ON THAT DAY,
I WAS SO HAPPY

261
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:58,833
PLAYING IN A TERRITORY BELONGING
TO JURAI'S ROYAL FAMILY,

262
00:13:58,916 --> 00:13:59,750
MY FAMILY.

263
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,916
IT WAS THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL PLACE

264
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,833
WITH ALL SORTS
OF FLOWERS IN BLOOM.

265
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:05,583
- HEY, YOU!
- WHAT?

266
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:06,708
- YOU'RE HAVING FUN,
AREN'T YOU?

267
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,375
- HELLO, WHO ARE YOU?

268
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,625
- DID YOU MAKE
THAT THING YOURSELF?

269
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:14,916
- I DID.

270
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
- WELL, AREN'T WE SO TALENTED?
- ( whimpers )

271
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:22,708
- AND NOW IT'S ALL MINE.
SO LONG SUCKER!

272
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:25,208
- YOU'RE MEAN.

273
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:29,125
- THAT WAS MY FIRST ENCOUNTER
WITH RYOKO.

274
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:32,333
- RYOKO, THAT'S COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT FROM WHAT YOU TOLD US.

275
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:35,083
- ( sarcastic ) GEE,
I WONDER WHICH STORY'S TRUE?

276
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:38,166
- HEY, ARE YOU SUGGESTING
I TOLD YOU A LIE?

277
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,250
- I'M SURE YOUR STORY WAS
JUST MADE-UP MISH-MASH.

278
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,500
- HEY, YOU'RE FULL
OF MISH-MASH, PRINCESS.

279
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,125
- NOW, LISTEN, YOU!

280
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:46,750
YOU'VE BEEN CONVICTED OF FRAUD

281
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:49,500
AND YOU DARE CALL MY STORY
A MISH-MASH?!

282
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,583
- MISS AYEKA, PLEASE CALM DOWN.

283
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:53,458
I-- ARGH!
- OH, TENCHI!

284
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:55,583
YOU SEE HOW SHE IS?

285
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:58,500
YOU SEE HOW THAT HYSTERICAL
WOMAN IS SO MEAN TO ME?

286
00:14:58,583 --> 00:14:59,750
- HEY, STOP IT.

287
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:00,500
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

288
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:01,791
LET GO OF HIM!
- HMM.

289
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,250
WHAT ARE YOU SO UPSET ABOUT?

290
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:05,750
YOU SAID YOU WEREN'T FLIRTING,
DIDN'T YOU?

291
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:06,750
- HMM.

292
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:09,125
- HEY, TENCHI, 
LET'S SHOW HER.

293
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,458
LET'S SHOW HER
HOW MUCH WE'RE IN LOVE.

294
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,458
LET'S SHOW HER. 
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

295
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:15,125
- ( groaning )
- WILL YOU STOP IT?

296
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:16,291
- WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?
IT'S NOT LIKE

297
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,166
YOU'RE GONNA LOSE
ANYTHING, RIGHT?

298
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,041
- HEY, ARE YOU CRAZY?
- ( groaning )

299
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:22,416
- I'VE HAD ENOUGH!

300
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,625
FOR THE SAKE
OF UNIVERSAL PEACE,

301
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:29,875
I AM GOING TO FINISH YOU OFF
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

302
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:31,083
- OKAY, GREAT.

303
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:33,125
LET'S JUST SEE
IF YOU REALLY CAN.

304
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:38,666
- HELLO.
UH, EXCUSE ME.

305
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,000
COULD YOU TWO FIGHT 
AFTER YOU RESCUE ME?

306
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:45,833
I WAS JUST WONDERING IF,
UM, I--

307
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:48,125
ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME?

308
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:50,958
- AZAKA, KAMIDAKE,
OPEN THE HATCH!

309
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:53,166
WE'RE TAKING RYU-OH
UP TO ATTACK

310
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,166
- WAIT A MINUTE, PLEASE.
PLEASE TAKE CARE OF ME FIRST

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES
MUST RYOKO ESCAPE ALIVE!

- THE PROBLEM WON'T
BE SOLVED WITH VIOLENCE.

324

- REST IN PEACE,
PRINCESS AYEKA.

NOW YOU KNOW BETTER,
RYOKO.

00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,291
- HA! WE HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED.

341
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:58,916
- ALL RIGHT,
ENOUGH OF THIS ALREADY.

342
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,166
- LORD TENCHI,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE?

343
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,916
- HMM.

344
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,625
WHERE ELSE WOULD HE BE?

345
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,750
TENCHI AND I
HAVE A SPECIAL BOND.

346
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:08,875
WE HAVE TAKEN A VOW
TO DIE TOGETHER.

347
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:11,791
- WHOA! WHAT VOW?

348
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:14,541
- YOU-- YOU MEAN...

349
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:16,791
OH NO!

350
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:22,916
LORD TENCHI, TAKING A VOW
WITH A LOWLY CREATURE LIKE HER,

351
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,666
THERE IS NOTHING LEFT
FOR ME TO BELIEVE IN.

352
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,500
- IT'S A LIE, AYEKA!

353
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:29,500
- NOW, TENCHI, LET'S
FIGHT THAT EVIL PRINCESS

354
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:31,375
WITH THE POWER OF OUR LOVE.
- ( crying )

355
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:32,458
- WOULD YOU STOP IT?

356
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:34,541
- WELL, IF THAT'S THE CASE...

357
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,625
WE DIE.

358
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:41,791
MISS RYOKO, LORD TENCHI,

359
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:44,541
THEN ALL THREE OF US
GO TO HELL TOGETHER.

360
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:49,041
MISS AYEKA, I THINK YOU'VE
FORGOTTEN ABOUT ME.

- ( laughing )
- STOP IT, PLEASE, LADY AYEKA.

364
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:07,125
- Kamidake: WHOA! LADY AYEKA
HAS LOST HER TEMPER!

- WELL, NO ONE'S HURT
AND THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

368
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:14,375
YOU'RE WELCOME TO STAY HERE
WITH US FOR AS LONG AS YOU LIKE.

369
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:16,583
- I APPRECIATE IT, SIR.

370
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:19,291
- WE TAKE YOUR OFFER
WITH THANKS.

371
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:21,458
- GREAT.
MORE FREELOADERS.

372
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:22,625
IT'S REALLY ANNOYING.

373
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,958
- WELL, IT'S ALL
YOUR FAULT, YOU KNOW.

374
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:27,291
- YEAH, WELL, MY RYO-OHKI

DO YOU REMEMBER, HUH?

I TOLD YOU TO FIGHT
<i>AFTER</i> YOU RESCUED ME!

00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:37,541
BY THE WAY,
WHERE'S MISS AYEKA?

379
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:39,875
- SHE'S STILL IN SHOCK 
FROM SEEING RYU-OH,

380
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:41,291
HER SPACESHIP, BLOW UP.

381
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:46,666
- MISS AYEKA?
- OH, YES.

382
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:59,916

383
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,458
WOULD YOU LIKE SOME, AYEKA?

384
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:05,958
MAYBE A LITTLE LATER, HUH?

385
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:07,875
- YES.

386
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:09,958
