96
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:12,458
I GOT TO GO TO WORK.
- BUT TODAY IS SUNDAY.

97

GIVE ME ENOUGH TIME

I WONDER?

IS THAT YOU OVER THERE, AYEKA?
- HUH?

I'M NOT DISTURBING YOU.

- OH, IS THAT SOMETHING
FOR US TO MUNCH ON?

142
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:30,583
I WOULD SAY THE LESSON IS OVER

RAIKO.

148
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,583
DID I ASK YOU TO DO
SOMETHING FOR ME TODAY?

149
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,958
- OH NO.
I JUST LEFT SOMETHING HERE.

150
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,750
( gasps )
FLOWERS? 

151
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,250
WHAT'S THE OCCASION?

152
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:10,166
- ( chuckles )
I WANTED TO GIVE THEM TO YOU.

153

MR. MASAKI,

154
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:16,458
YOU'RE ALWAYS KIDDING ME.
( laughs )

155

( laughs ) OH.

156
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:24,291
- TELL ME SOMETHING.

157
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:27,041
WHY ARE YOU PRACTICING
WITH A SWORD, TENCHI?

158
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:29,291
- I'VE ALWAYS DONE IT
SINCE MY CHILDHOOD.

159
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:31,208
AND I NEVER REALLY
THOUGHT ABOUT IT MUCH.

160
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:36,291
COME TO THINK OF IT,
WHY AM I PRACTICING? HUH?

161
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:39,000
- ( giggles )
TENCHI, YOU'RE A STRANGE ONE.

( giggles )

163
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:43,625
- ( both chuckle )

164
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,125
- Sasami: AYEKA!

165
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:47,500
- Kamidake: PRINCESS AYEKA!
- AYEKA!

166
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:50,125
- SASAMI, WHY ARE YOU
IN SUCH A HURRY?

167
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:52,500
- ( pants )

168
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,541
- IT'S RYU-OH.
- WHAT ABOUT IT?

169
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,583
- Azaka: PRINCESS, PLEASE
LOOK TOWARD THE LAKE.

170
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:58,333
- HUH?
- Both: THE LAKE?

171
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:03,375
- COULD IT BE?

172
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,166
- YO!

173
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:11,916
YO!

174
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,458
- ( sighs )

175
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,208
RYU-OH.

176
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:25,500
- WHAT? RYU-OH?

177
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,583
WASN'T THAT THE NAME
OF YOUR SPACESHIP, AYEKA?

178
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:30,166
- YES, IT'S REGENERATING ITSELF.

179
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:34,875
- RYU-OH'S CURRENT
REGENERATION LEVEL IS .05%.

180
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:38,041
- SINCE IT IS ROOTED TO
THE WRECK OF THE MAIN SHIP,

181
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:40,958
IT CANNOT FUNCTION
AS AN INDEPENDENT UNIT.

182
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,625
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

183
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:46,458
I HAVE ALWAYS HAD RYU-OH
EVER SINCE I WAS A LITTLE GIRL.

184
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:49,166
I DID NOT THINK IT COULD
REGENERATE ITSELF

185
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,625
ON THIS PLANET.

186
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:53,083
- I'M VERY HAPPY FOR YOU,
MISS AYEKA.

187
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,916
- AH.

188
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:03,708
- ( gasps )

189
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,458
- AH.

190
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:15,708
- Kiyone:
( inhales )

191
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:16,750
( sneezes )

192
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,791
- KIYONE, POOR THING.

193
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,333
YOU'VE GOT A COLD.

194
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:21,750
- LOOKS LIKE IT.

195
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:23,791
IT GOT CHILLY
SO SUDDENLY YESTERDAY.

196
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:26,000
OH, I HATE THIS.
( inhales )

197
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:27,666
( blows )

198
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,666
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
MY GRANDFATHER TOLD ME

199
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,458
YOU CAN GET RID OF A COLD
REALLY QUICKLY

200
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:34,583
IF YOU GIVE IT
TO SOMEONE ELSE.

201
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:36,416
( giggles )

202
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,291
I'VE HAD A SLIGHT COLD
SINCE YESTERDAY,

203
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:40,583
BUT TODAY
I FEEL REALLY GREAT.

204
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,333
- YOU MEAN I CAUGHT THIS
FROM YOU?!

205
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:45,666
- ( coughs )

206
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,625
- ( door slides )
- I'M HOME.

207
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,250
- HEY, DAD.
DINNER IS READY.

208
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:52,958
- OH, BE RIGHT THERE.

209
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:56,291
- NOBUYUKI.
- HMM? YES, WHAT IS IT, FATHER?

210
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:58,125
- HOW 'BOUT HAVING
SOME DRINKS LATER?

211
00:11:58,208 --> 00:11:59,291
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

212
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,500
- THAT SOUNDS
LIKE A GREAT IDEA.

213
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:03,958
WE CAN ENJOY SAKE
AND WATCH THE SNOW.

214
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:05,541
( chuckles )
- HUH?

215
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:10,458
- HERE, DRINK UP.

216
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:13,708
- OH, THAT'S PLENTY.  WOW.

217
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:17,958
DID YOU HAVE TO GO
TO THE OFFICE TODAY?

218
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:21,916
- YOU KNOW WHAT?  I DESIGNED
SIX HOUSES THIS MONTH ALONE.

219
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,541
SIX HOUSES!
- ( sipping ) HMM.

220
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:26,333
- IS THAT RIGHT?
- I'M DEFINITELY OVERWORKED.

221
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:28,833
- ( gulping )
- HMM, I SEE.

222
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:34,708
- WATCH THE SNOW.

223
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:35,791
- Ryoko: TENCHI.

224
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:37,625
WHAT'S THE MATTER, TENCHI?

225
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:39,458
COME ON, HAVE SOME SAKE.

226
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:42,041
- UH, NO THANKS.
THINK I'LL PASS ON THAT.

227
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:44,583
- COME ON NOW.
HERE, HAVE SOME.

228
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,333
- HEY, RYOKO.  UGH.

229
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:47,625
- GIVE ME THAT!

230
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:50,250
TENCHI SAYS HE DOES
NOT WANT TO DRINK. 

231
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,958
( gulping )

232
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:54,583
( gasping )

233
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:57,208
- WOW, WAY TO GO, AYEKA.

234
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:58,958
( whistles )
- ( gulping )

235
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:00,000
- ( sighs )

236
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:03,458
- OH NO.
WE ARE OUT OF SAKE.

237
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:05,583
- WHAT? OUT ALREADY?

238
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,166
TENCHI, GO BUY SOME MORE.

239
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,750
- WHY ME, GRANDPA?

240
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:11,458
- JUST GO GET MORE SAKE.

241
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,750
- PLEASE GO TO THE STORE
FOR US, TENCHI.

242
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:14,875
- ( sighs )

243
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:19,250
- ( groaning ) 
- HERE, KIYONE.

244
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,500
HAVE THIS.
IT'S SORT OF LIKE AN EGGNOG.

245
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:22,750
- WHAT IS IT?

246
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:24,541
IT'S JUST GREAT.

247
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,875
IT'S A SPECIAL COLD REMEDY
ON THIS PLANET.

248
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,875
- ( rooster crows )

249
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:31,000
- UGH!

250
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:33,875
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

251
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:36,791
- ( snoring )

252
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,625
- WHERE IS TENCHI ANYWAY?

253
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:40,208
- NOW, NOW.

254
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:43,250
I WILL OPEN UP
THE SPECIAL SAKE FOR US.

255
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:46,541
- OH, IT'S THAT SPECIAL BRAND.
( chuckles )

256
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:53,458
HMM.

257
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,208
THIS IS MY FAVORITE.
IT REALLY IS.

258
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:58,375
- YES, IT'S MY FAVORITE ALSO.

259
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:02,708
- YOU KNOW, EVEN THOUGH
YOU'RE MY SON-IN-LAW,

260
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:04,250
YOU'RE A LOT LIKE ME.

261
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,416
- DO YOU THINK SO?

262
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:14,083
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
- WHAT IS IT?

263
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:17,083
- I USED TO HATE THE SNOW.

264
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,583
- WELL, THAT'S A COINCIDENCE.

265
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:20,958
I DID TOO.

266
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:25,458
- BUT...

267
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:31,125
NOWADAYS, I DON'T
HATE IT MUCH ANYMORE.

268
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:35,541
LET'S DRINK TO...

269
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,666
- THE SNOW
OF OUR MEMORIES.

270
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,250
- Both: ( gulping )

271
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:41,625
( sighing )

272
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:53,458
- CAN THOSE GUYS
BE MORE DEMANDING OR WHAT?

273
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:59,000
- ( children's laughing echoes )

274
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:00,458
- HUH?

275
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:03,208
- ( laughter intensifies )

276
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:14,666
( laughter continues )

277
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,333
- WHAT THE?

278
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:28,666
- THERE YOU ARE.
WELCOME BACK.

279
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,916
- HI, SASAMI.
WHERE ARE MY DAD AND GRANDPA?

280
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,541
HUH?

281
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:35,625
( groans )

282
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:37,541
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?

283
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:42,750
- ( gasps ) TENCHI!
- I-- I'M ALL RIGHT.

284
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:45,666
I MUST HAVE BEEN TOO ACTIVE
IN THIS COLD WEATHER.

285
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,291
( groans )
- OH.

286
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:50,000
( groaning )

287
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,208
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU, TENCHI.

288
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:54,416
OH NO.
TENCHI, ARE YOU OKAY?

289
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,208
- ( groans )

290
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:59,208
- SOMEONE COME AND HELP ME.
( gasps )

291
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,291
- ( snoring )

292
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:12,583
- ( panting )

293
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:15,041
- PRINCESS SASAMI,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE SO LATE?

294
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,750
- TENCHI SEEMS TO BE SICK
OR SOMETHING.

295
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:20,208
HE'S BREATHING HEAVILY
AND SWEATING A LOT.

296
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:22,208
- PLEASE TRY TO CALM DOWN.

297
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:24,375
- HE'S NOT FEELING WELL.
HE HAS A FEVER.

298
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:26,458
- THOSE SOUND LIKE THE SYMPTOMS
OF THE FLU.

299
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:28,458
- CERTAINLY SOUNDS 
LIKE THE FLU TO ME.

300
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:30,125
- CAN YOU DO
SOMETHING ABOUT IT?

301
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:31,416
- HMM.

302
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,583
HOW ABOUT APPLYING
SOME OF THE SAP FROM RYU-OH.

303
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,750
- RYU-OH'S SAP?

304
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:38,500
GREAT IDEA.

305
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,125
- ( thoughts )
PLEASE.

306
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,291
PLEASE HELP TENCHI, PLEASE?

307
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:19,416
( gasps )

308
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,875
( gasps )

309
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,875
- ( light piano plays )

310
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:46,791
- ( laughing )

311
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:13,541
- ( silent )

312
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:26,833
- ( branch cracks )

313
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:30,250
- ( crying )

314
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:36,000
( crying echoes )

315
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:50,750
HMM.

316
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:54,208
THAT'S RIGHT.

317
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:56,875
I GOT SICK AND THEN... HUH?

318
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:58,500
HEY, SASAMI.

319
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:07,625
I THANK YOU,
PRINCESS SASAMI.

320
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,791
I'VE GOT TO GO.

321
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:18,250
( panting ) OH!

322
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,416
( thoughts )
I REMEMBER. 

323
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,666
IT WAS A SNOWY DAY
LIKE TODAY

324
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:25,875
WHEN MY MOM...

325
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:36,083
( panting )

326
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:41,875
DAD? GRANDPA?

327
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:52,625
- GET OVER HERE, TENCHI.

328
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:54,833
SAY HELLO TO YOUR MOTHER.

329
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:56,750
- UH, SURE.

330
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:08,083
- BOTH OF YOU REMEMBERED, HUH?

331
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:12,000
- IT WAS SNOWING LIKE THIS
ON THE DAY THAT SHE DIED. 

332
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:15,458
- THOSE FLOWERS,

333
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:18,958
THEY'RE THE KIND 
MOM REALLY LIKED.

334
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:20,958
- WELL, YOU KNOW, I JUST--

335
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:23,791
OH, I ALMOST FORGOT
TO TELL YOU, MY DEAR.

336
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:26,458
OUR LITTLE TENCHI
NOW HAS A LOT OF GIRLFRIENDS.

337
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:28,958
I WAS WORRIED ABOUT HIM
BEING TOO SHY WITH WOMEN.

338
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:31,708
BUT AFTER ALL,
HE IS MY SON, YOU KNOW.

339
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:33,166
- AWW, DAD.

340
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,625
- ALTHOUGH HIS SWORD TECHNIQUE
DOES NEED WORK.

341
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,666
- COME ON, GRANDPA.

342
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,375
- WELL, I'VE GOT TO GET GOING.

343
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:41,583
IT'S ABOUT TIME FOR ME
TO GET TO THE OFFICE. 

344
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:43,833
I HAVE A PROJECT
DUE TOMORROW SO...

345
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:46,166
- AND I'M GOING BACK
TO THE SHRINE.

346
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:53,208
- TENCHI, DON'T YOU
BE LATE FOR SCHOOL.

347
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:54,708
- OH, I WON'T.

348
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:57,583
- HEY, WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING OUT HERE, TENCHI?

349
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:58,791
- WHAT IS IT, SASAMI?

350
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:01,666
- YOU SHOULD STILL
BE IN BED, TENCHI.

351
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,916
- I'M FEELING FINE NOW.

352
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,750
- WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU WERE IN SUCH PAIN YESTERDAY.

353
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:07,375
YOU'RE NOT WELL YET.

354
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,541
- BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
- WHAT?

355
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:12,625
- I KIND OF FEEL
REALLY GOOD NOW.

356
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,708
- HUH?

357
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:20,916
- BY THE WAY,
DOES RYU-OH'S SAP

358
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,416
WORK ON LIFE FORMS
FROM THIS PLANET ALSO?

359
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:27,791
- WELL, TENCHI
SEEMS TO BE FINE.

360
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:31,375
SO I SUPPOSE IT DOES.
