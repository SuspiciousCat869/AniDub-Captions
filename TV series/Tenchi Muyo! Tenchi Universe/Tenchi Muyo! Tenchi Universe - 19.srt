- SLOW POKE, COME ON.
EAT UP, WILL YOU?

35
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:42,208
- WELL, I'M NOT LIKE YOU, RYOKO.

36
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:45,083
I REALLY CAN'T BRING MYSELF
TO EAT LIKE A BARBARIAN.

37
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:47,375
FIRST I START WITH MY APPETIZERS

38
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:48,541
AND THEN MOVE ON TO MY SOUP.

- HEY, IT'S JUST PICKLES
AND MISO SOUP.

40
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:54,041
- EXCUSE ME.
OH, MR. MANAGER.

00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:56,541
I THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME
YOU SERVED US OUR MAIN DISH.

YOUR ORDER SHOULD BE
COMING RIGHT UP, MA'AM.

00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,416
HEY, AMARUBE, YURA,

47
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,750
THAT'S A LONG ENOUGH BREAK!

48
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:11,666
COME ON, YOU TWO,
GET BACK TO WORK.

AMARUBE, YURA,
YOU ARE FIRED!

00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:17,125
NOW GET OUT!

YOU BIG MOUTH.

53
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:27,083
I'M TOO GOOD TO BE WORKING
IN A BEEF BALL JOINT ANYWAY.

54
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,041

58
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:50,625

- Manager:
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

65
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:08,375
- HEY, AYEKA,

66
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:10,375
WE'RE GONNA GO ON AND
HEAD BACK TO YAGAMI NOW.

67

OKAY?

73
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:45,166
- OH NO.
THAT'S YAGAMI!

74
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,250
- HEY, STOP!

75

I WANT TO GET ON YOU TOO,
YAGAMI.

( screaming )

82
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:19,208
- OH WELL, YAGAMI'S GONE.

83
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:21,250
- YAGAMI'S BEEN HIJACKED.

84
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:23,041
HOW CAN YOU BE
SO CASUAL ABOUT IT?

85
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:26,208
- WHAT? HIJACKED?

86
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:29,875
- ( screaming )

87
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,875
- COME BACK, YAGAMI.

88
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,500
DON'T LEAVE WITHOUT US.

89
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:36,916
- WHY? WHY? WHY?

90
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:44,583

TOOK YOUR TIME EATING

92
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:47,708
WHOEVER STOLE MY SHIP

93
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:50,000
SURE HAD A LOT OF NERVE.
THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY.

94
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,125
- HEY, YAGAMI'S MY SHIP.

95
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:55,583
- COME ON, GIRLS,
LET'S FOCUS.

96
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:57,208
- FIRST, I'M GONNA FIND 'EM

97
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,250
AND THEN I'M GONNA
BEAT 'EM UP REAL GOOD.

98
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:00,791
COME ON, RYO-OHKI.

99
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:03,000
- ( meows )

100
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:13,083
- LET'S GO.

101
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:14,375
- RIGHT.
- OKAY. 

102
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,916
- ( meows )

103
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:21,416

104
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,875
RYO-OHKI IS LEAVING US.

105
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:25,500
- HEY, TENCHI, WAIT FOR US.

106
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:28,291
- PLEASE, CALL
A SPACE CAB, SASAMI.

107
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:29,625
WE SHOULD FOLLOW THEM.

108
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:32,416
- BUT I DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY.

109
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,375
- HUH?

110
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:36,500

111
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:42,875
- HUH?

112
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:47,125
- HERE'S YOUR CHECK.

113
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:01,625
- YEEHAW!

114
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:03,125
WE ARE CRUISING.

115
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:06,166
- ALL RIGHT! GO FASTER!

116
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:16,125
- WE MUST NOT LET THEM GET AWAY,
RYOKO.

117
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:18,666
- COUNT ON ME.
- I DO.

118
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,208
GRANDPA AND DAD ARE
STILL ON YAGAMI, YOU KNOW.

119
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:26,083
- ( stomach rumbles )

( sighs )

121
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,333
GEE, WHERE ARE THEY?

122
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:32,208
I WONDER, DO YOU THINK THEY
FORGOT ABOUT OUR BEEF BOWLS?

123
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:37,000
- EASY NOW.
DON'T ACT SO DESPERATE.

124
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:39,750
A SAMURAI SHOULD BETRAY
ABSOLUTELY NO WEAKNESS

125
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:40,875
WHEN STARVING.

126
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:42,958
- BUT, DAD, COME ON.

127
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:46,041
- CHECKMATE.
- HUH?

128
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,541
HUH?!

129
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:50,500

- ( all groaning )

140
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:48,750
- HEY, IDIOT.
YOU RAN A RED LIGHT.

141
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:51,083
WHY DON'T YOU LOOK
WHERE YOU'RE GOING, YOU JERK?

142
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,208
- GREAT.
NOW WE'VE LOST THEM.

143
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:08,750
- NOW WHAT?

144
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:10,791
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN
TO DAD AND GRANDPA?

145
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:13,208
- WHAT ABOUT YAGAMI?
WHAT ABOUT MY SHIP? 

146
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:15,125
- I CAN'T DO ANYTHING
ABOUT IT NOW.

147
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:16,708
- HEY, I KNOW.

148
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:18,083
WHY DON'T WE REPORT
THIS INCIDENT

149
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:20,791
TO THE GALAXY POLICE.
WHAT'D YOU THINK, HUH?

150
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:23,541
- MIHOSHI, AND JUST
WHO DO YOU THINK WE ARE?

151
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,666
HUH? CAN YOU TELL ME?
HUH? HUH?

152
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,625
- WE ARE THE MOST
WANTED CRIMINALS 

153
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:30,791
IN THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE,
AREN'T WE?

154
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:36,791
- TO US!

155
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:39,000
( gulping )

156
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:42,458
- AH, SO WE DID IT, AMARUBE.

157
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:45,541
- A PIECE OF CAKE. FOR THE
BEST GANGSTER IN THE UNIVERSE,

158
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:47,500
STEALING THIS SHIP
WAS TOO EASY.

159
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:49,541
HMM.

160
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:52,625
YOU KNOW, IT'S ALWAYS
BEEN A DREAM OF MINE.

161
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:55,000
TO TRAVEL IN A SHIP
LIKE THIS.

162
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:57,166
- WELL, YOU'VE GOT YOUR WISH.

163
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,500
AND THUS, OUR LEGEND BEGINS.

164
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,000
- BUT HOW?

165
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:03,000
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO
TO BECOME A LEGEND? 

166
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,333
TELL ME THE PLAN.

167
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,500
- HUH, WELL, FIRST OF ALL,

168
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:11,041
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE SELL THIS SHIP

169
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:12,500
AND GET US SOME DOUGH?

170
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:14,083
- GREAT!
YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT?

171
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:15,708
I WANT A NICE PURSE,
AND SOME NEW SHOES, 

172
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:17,708
AND A PIECE OF CHEESECAKE
FROM SIRIUS.

173
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:21,125
- AND I'M GONNA BUY 
MYSELF A SPACE SHIP.

174
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:22,541
- IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT,

175
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,333
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
KEEP THIS ONE?

176
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,166
- HUH?

177
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,291
OH.

178
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:29,541
- ( laughing )

179
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,166
- ( beeping )

180
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:53,458
- ATTENTION ALL PATROL SHIPS,

181
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:55,583
ATTENTION ALL PATROL SHIPS...

182
00:10:57,458 --> 00:11:00,916
WE HAVE JUST SPOTTED YAGAMI
IN SPACE ZONE 6-0-2.

183
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:05,458
PROCEED TO THE SCENE
IMMEDIATELY.

184
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:07,458
PROCEED TO THE SCENE
IMMEDIATELY.

185
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,083
THIS IS GALAXY POLICE.

186
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,666
YAGAMI, STOP YOUR
ENGINE RIGHT NOW.

187
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,541
WE WILL ATTACK
IF YOU DON'T COOPERATE.

188
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:24,083
- UH, I DON'T GET IT.

189
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:26,500
HOW DID THOSE GUYS KNOW
THIS WAS A HIJACKED SHIP?

190
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,458
- WHAT'S OUR PLAN FOR THIS?

191
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:30,791
- HEH! WE'LL JUST
OUTRUN THEM.

192
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,125
- THEY'RE TRYING TO GET AWAY.
ENGAGE AND PURSUE!

193
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,708
- YOU SEE,
THEY'RE NO MATCH FOR ME.

194
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:43,833
- THEY MUST BE DREAMING
IF THEY THINK THEY CAN CATCH

195
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:45,666
THE GREATEST GANGSTER
IN THE UNIVERSE.

196
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,416
- "YAGAMI." THAT NAME SOUNDS
FAMILIAR, SOMEHOW.

197
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,458
HUH?

198
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:51,416
- ( beeping )

199
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,000
- HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
- WHAT?

200
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:55,208
- LOOK!

201
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:57,958
- HUH? AAH!

202
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:06,333
OH MAN! WHAT'S HAPPENING?

203
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:08,666
- IT'S JUST A REGULAR HIJACKING.

204
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,541
I MEAN, AREN'T THEY KIND OF
OVERDOING IT?

205
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,125
- YO!

206
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:23,750
YO!

207
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,333
- EARLIER TODAY, PRINCESS AYEKA
AND HER GROUP

208
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:34,333
WERE SPOTTED
IN SPACE ZONE 6-0-2

209
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:36,166
ABOARD THE SPACE SHIP YAGAMI.

210
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,333
THE GALAXY POLICE
ARE IN HOT PURSUIT.

211
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:41,666
AND ARE HEADING TOWARD
SPACE ZONE 5-28.

212
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,583
- ( gasps )
- WHAT?

213
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:46,416
- ON BOARD YAGAMI
ARE PRINCESS AYEKA,

214
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,500
HER SISTER PRINCESS SASAMI,

215
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:49,583
THE SPACE PIRATE RYOKO,

216
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:52,541
AND TWO FORMER GALAXY
POLICE OFFICERS.

217
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,458
THE PRESENCE OF THREE 
UNIDENTIFIED CIVILIANS

218
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:56,750
HAS YET TO BE CONFIRMED.
- ( whimpering )

219
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:59,416
- HEY, THEY WERE CUSTOMERS
AT THE BEEF BOWL PLACE, YURA.

220
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,333
- THEN DON'T YOU SEE?
THIS SHIP BELONGS TO THEM.

221
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:04,750
- SO WE'RE BEING MISTAKEN

222
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:07,250
FOR THE MOST WANTED
CRIMINALS IN THE UNIVERSE.

223
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:08,666
- OH NO!

224
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,250
- OH, THIS IS TOO PERFECT.

225
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:13,416
ALL RIGHT, PEOPLE.
NOW WE KNOW WHERE YAGAMI IS.

226
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,458
- JUST WHAT'S THERE
TO BE CHEERFUL ABOUT?

227
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:17,583
- THE GALAXY POLICE
ARE AFTER US, YOU KNOW?

228
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:20,000
- YEAH, I'LL WORRY
ABOUT THEM, OKAY? 

229
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:23,666
RYO-OHKI, PROCEED IMMEDIATELY
TO SPACE ZONE 5-2-8.

230
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,916
- ( meows )

231
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,541
- GRANDPA, DAD,
I HOPE YOU'RE SAFE.

232
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:36,875
- CHESS IS A BATTLE
FOUGHT PEACEFULLY. 

233
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:40,083
IT CULTIVATES THE MIND,
THE SPIRIT, AND THE SOUL.

234
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:42,458
AND WE MUST ALWAYS 
CULTIVATE THE SOUL.

235
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,541
- CHECKMATE.

236
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,458
- EH?

237
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,708
- ( sirens wail )

238
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:03,750
- ( cries )
AMARUBE, DO SOMETHING.

239
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:06,750
YOU WANT TO BE THE GREATEST
GANGSTER IN THE UNIVERSE, RIGHT?

240
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,583
YOU WANT TO BE A LEGEND, RIGHT?

241
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:11,500
- ( gasps )
EASY FOR YOU TO SAY.

242
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:14,583
DOESN'T THIS SHIP HAVE
A TURBO BOOSTER OR SOMETHING?

243
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,291
- ( fireworks crackle )

244
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:22,750
- NO!

245
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:24,541
WHAT DID I DO?!

246
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:31,208
- SIR, THEY FIRED AT US,
CAPTAIN.

247
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:32,583
- RETURN FIRE.

248
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:35,041
THESE ARE MOST WANTED CRIMINALS.
SHOW NO MERCY.

249
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:42,708
- THIS REPORT JUST IN.

250
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:46,166
APPARENTLY, MOMENTS AGO,
YAGAMI AND THE GALAXY POLICE

251
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,791
BEGAN EXCHANGING FIRE.

252
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:51,125
- NOW, THEY'RE MAKING THINGS
EVEN MORE COMPLICATED.

253
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:52,625
- NO KIDDING, RYOKO.

254
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:54,291
BUT WE DON'T WANT
TO GET CAUGHT EITHER.

255
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:55,791
- WE SHOULD BE
ROOTING FOR THEM.

256
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:58,041
COME ON, GET AWAY
FROM THE POLICE. 

257
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:00,625
- UGH! I HAVE MIXED FEELINGS
ABOUT THIS.

258
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:02,375
ARE WE ROOTING
FOR THE HIJACKERS?

259
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:06,833
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

260
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:09,166
YOU'VE GOT THE POLICE
ALL ANGRY.

261
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,708
- WELL, I REALLY
DIDN'T MEAN TO. 

262
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:13,083
- ( cries )

263
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:14,791
- Captain: YOU HAVE NOWHERE
TO HIDE, PRINCESS AYEKA.

264
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:17,125
- THIS IS A SLIGHT
MISUNDERSTANDING. 

265
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,958
- YEAH, WE'RE JUST A COUPLE
OF INNOCENT GANGSTERS.

266
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:23,291
- ( cries )
I'M SO SCARED.

267
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:25,125
- PLEASE HELP ME, MOMMY.

268
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:26,583
- HOW PATHETIC.

269
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:29,416
- AND THOSE ARE THE GUYS WHO
STOLE YAGAMI FROM US?

270
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,375
- BUT I FEEL SO
SORRY FOR THEM 

271
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:33,458
BEING MISTAKEN FOR
THE MOST WANTED CRIMINALS.

272
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:34,833
- WILL YOU PLEASE--

273
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:37,333
- Amarube: OH NO!
WE'RE GONNA BE KILLED.

274
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:39,666
AND I DON'T WANT TO DIE.

275
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,958
- WHEN ARE WE GONNA CATCH UP
WITH THEM, RYOKO?

276
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,666
- IT'S NOT THAT EASY, TENCHI.

277
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,791
THEY ARE TRAVELLING
AT TOP-SPEED TOO, YOU KNOW?

278
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:49,833
- CHECKMATE.

279
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,250
- HMM?

280
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:52,750
NOW JUST WAIT.

281
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:55,500
- WELL, NOW THERE'S
NO WAITING IN BATTLE,

282
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:58,000
BUT I'LL DO THIS INSTEAD.

283
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,166
- WHAT?!

284
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,958
- LOOKS LIKE WE DON'T 
HAVE ANY OTHER CHOICE.

285
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:05,666
- WE DON'T.

286
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,666
- OPERATION SPEED UP RYO-OHKI.

287
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:13,166
IF WE USE THIS TACTIC
ON RYO-OHKI...

288
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,416
HMM.

289
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:22,333
- ( yowling )

290
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,583
- HMM?

291
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:32,541
- BUT THAT IS A CHILI PEPPER
FROM THE BEEF BOWL PLACE.

292
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:35,208
- FEEDING SOME CHILI PEPPER
TO RYO-OHKI?

293
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:37,958
THAT'S WHAT YOU MEANT BY
OPERATION SPEED UP?

294
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:40,875
- WELL, YEAH. UNFORTUNATELY,
BY USING THIS TACTIC,

295
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,541
RYO-OHKI WILL BE ANGRY WITH ME
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.

296
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:44,833
- ( yowls )

297
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,333
- ( sirens wail )

298
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:02,500
- ( yowls )

299
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,416
- THERE IT IS.

300
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:18,125
- HUH?

301
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,291
THAT STAR IS...

302
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:34,375
- YAGAMI IS HEADED STRAIGHT
TOWARD THAT SUPER NOVA.

303
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:36,125
- GOOD.

304
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:38,041
THEN THEY CAN'T
GO ANYWHERE ELSE.

305
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,916
- I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE.

306
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,833
STOP, PLEASE.
LET'S JUST GO HOME.

307
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:44,916
RIGHT NOW!

308
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,416
- ( gargles )

309
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:49,708
- EEK.

310
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:54,583
AAH! A-- OH!

311
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:58,833
- WE'LL BE ENTERING
THE SUPER NOVA'S

312
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:00,625
GRAVITATIONAL FIELD
IN TWO MINUTES.

313
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:03,166
ONCE WE FLY INTO
THE SPHERE OF GRAVITATION,

314
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,958
WE WON'T BE ABLE TO ESCAPE.

315
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,250
- HURRY UP, RYOKO.

316
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,250
- TENCHI, YOU'VE
GOT TO TRUST ME.

317
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:17,041
- ( meows )

318
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:36,541
- 60 MORE SECONDS BEFORE WE
REACH THE GRAVISPHERE.

319
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,666
- ( growls )

320
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,666
ALL RIGHT, HOLD THE FLEET.

321
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:50,666
- ( Ryo-Ohki whirrs )

322
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:51,833
( meows )

323
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:54,875
- ( grunting )

324
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:57,541
- HUH?

325
00:18:57,625 --> 00:19:01,875
- WELL, THEY'RE TOTALLY
OUT OF IT.

326
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:02,958
- HM-HMM.

327
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:06,000
- GRANDPA, DAD!
- ( pants )

328
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:08,291
- OH WELCOME BACK, TENCHI.

329
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:10,708
- WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG THERE,
MY SON, HUH?

330
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:12,416
- HUH?

331
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:17,833
- WHAT SHOULD WE DO NOW?

332
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:19,041
- DON'T WORRY.

333
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,500
ACCORDING TO MY CALCULATIONS,

334
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:22,000
WE USE THE GRAVITY TO ESCAPE

335
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:24,208
IF WE GO IN IT
AT A 34 DEGREE ANGLE

336
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:27,000
AND THEN GO FULL-BLAST
8.1 SECONDS LATER.

337
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,791
- USE THE GRAVITY?
ARE YOU INSANE?

338
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,666
- WELL, WE DON'T
HAVE TIME TO ARGUE.

339
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:35,916
- ACCELERATING?!
THEY'RE CRAZY!

340
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,125
- GO NOW.

341
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:58,125
- NO, IT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

342
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:04,666
- ( laughs )
YES, WE'VE DONE IT!

343
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,916
- HMM, SO AM I GENIUS
OR WHAT?

344
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,833
Tenchi: AND SO THE
HIJACKING-OF-YAGAMI INCIDENT

345
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:14,208
FINALLY ENDED.

346
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,583
- ( both scream )

347
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:23,375
- HMM, YUM.
- WHEW, I'M EXHAUSTED.

348
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:26,041
- OH BOY, WHAT AN
ORDEAL THAT WAS. 

349
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:28,291
- ( chewing )

350
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:29,958
- THIS BEEF BOWL
IS REALLY GOOD. 

351
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:31,750
ISN'T IT, DAD?
- YES.

352
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:34,250
THE ONIONS ESPECIALLY,
VERY TASTY.

353
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,250
- ( laughs )
GOOD BEEF BOWLS, HUH?

354
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:38,416
BEEF BOWLS?

355
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,000
BEEF BOWLS!

356

( screams )

357
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,666
- YES, WHAT ABOUT
BEEF BOWLS, TENCHI? WHAT?

358
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:48,291
- UH, WE'RE FORGETTING 
ABOUT AYEKA AND SASAMI.

359
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:00,041
- ( squeals )

360
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,833
OOH.
( giggles )

361
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:05,833
- ( sighs )

362
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:09,541
- THAT'S THREE HOURS
DISHWASHING.

363
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:13,291
THAT MEANS YOU HAVE
ANOTHER 89 HOURS TO GO.

364
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:15,625
- OH NO!

365
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:18,000
- OH NO.

366
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,958
- HERE YOU GO.

367
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:21,791
- OH.

369
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:30,291
