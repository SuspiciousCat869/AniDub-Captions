- ( giggles )

30
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:19,541
LET'S GO THIS WAY,

QUICKLY.

( giggles )

33
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:36,291
- YO!

34
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:13,916
- IT LOOKED LIKE
AN ORDINARY METEOR.

35
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,916
- CAPTAIN,
WE MUST STAY ALERT.

36
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,041
THAT'S AN ORDER
FROM PLANET JURAI.

37
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:19,291
- YES, SIR.

38
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:34,083
- PLEASE FOLLOW ME,
EVERYONE.

39
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,416
- ( meows )

40
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,708
- QUIET. BEHAVE YOURSELF,
RYO-OHKI.

41
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,458
- I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS.
IT'S SO STUPID.

00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:45,291
- OH, WHAT'S THE MATTER?
YOU LOOK JUST FINE.

43
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:47,125
- I DON'T LIKE IT.
- COME ON, ALREADY.

SORRY WE'RE LATE.

48
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,416
OKAY, LET'S GET GOING.
FOLLOW ME.

49
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,791
- I CANNOT BELIEVE
I'M DOING THIS.

50
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:06,291
- WOW, THIS AIRPORT
SURE IS HEAVILY GUARDED.

51
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:08,625
- I HEARD THAT PRINCESS AYEKA
AND HER ACCOMPLICES

52
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,750
ARE TRYING TO GET
TO PLANET JURAI. 

53
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,291
- OH MY.  REALLY?

54
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:14,416
- YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
THEY'RE SAYING.

55
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,750
- Both: OH, I'M SCARED.

56
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,750
- COME ON, YOU GIRLS.
KEEP MOVING.

57
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,250
- HEY THERE.

58
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:21,750
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE A
DRINK WITH ME LATER, HUH?

59
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:23,250
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
- OH MY.

60
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:25,125
YOU ARE SUCH A FLIRT,
MR. DRIVER.

61
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:27,250
- ( laughs )

62
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,666
- SAY WHAT SHOULD WE DO
WHEN WE GET THERE?

63
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,708
- I WANT TO EAT
SOMETHING DELICIOUS.

64
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:34,666
- I'M SO EMBARRASSED.

65
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,625
- EVERYONE,
COME THIS WAY, PLEASE.

66
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:40,166
- A SCHOOL TRIP FROM
THE PLANET YUBISU, HUH?

67
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,041
- THAT'S RIGHT.

68
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:45,500
- SEEMS LIKE AN AWFULLY 
SMALL GROUP, DOESN'T IT?

69
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:47,041
- WELL, IT'S A VERY
SMALL SCHOOL.

70
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:48,291
- UH, EXCUSE ME, MISS?

71
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:50,166
- ME?
- WHAT ARE YOU?

72
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,833
- I'M A GALAXY POLICE OFFICER.

73
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:54,166
- ( murmurs )
- WHAT?

74
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,166
- DOCTOR,
THERE YOU ARE.

75
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,250
YOU'RE A DOCTOR,
REMEMBER?

76
00:04:58,333 --> 00:04:59,708
- HMM?

77
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:01,500
OH, A DOCTOR!

78
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:04,208
I'M A DOCTOR AT
THE CLINIC ON CAMPUS.

79
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:06,375
- ALL RIGHT THEN.

80
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,041
EVERYTHING SEEMS
IN ORDER, MA'AM.

81
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:10,166
YOU MAY MOVE ALONG.
- All: THANK YOU, SIR.

82
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,166
VERY MUCH.

83
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,458
- ( giggles )

84
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:14,541
- OH?

85
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,208
( clears throat )

86
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:20,375
I NEED TO INSPECT
YOUR SHIP.

87
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:21,875
IT'S A STANDARD PRACTICE.

88
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:22,875
- UH...

89
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:30,666
- Both: HUH?

90
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:39,083
- UH...

91
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:44,416
- I'M AT BLOCK 13C.

92
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,291
NOTHING TO REPORT.

93
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:11,666
- THIS SCANNER IS
STATE OF THE ART.

94
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,583
- Ayeka: ARE YOU SURE
WE WON'T GET CAUGHT? 

95
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:17,000
- Washu: DON'T WORRY.
WHEN THEY SCAN OUR CLOTHES,

96
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:18,583
ALL THEY'LL SEE IS
FAKE DNA

97
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:20,500
AND SKELETON DATA.

98
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:27,375
THE CONTACT LENSES WE'RE 
WEARING HAVE FAKE RETINA.

99
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:30,250
WE HAVE PERFECT FAKE I.D.s

100
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:31,625
I'M UTTERLY FANTASTIC.

101
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:33,500
I'M SUCH A GENIUS,
AREN'T I?

102
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,625
- Both: YAY!

103
00:06:58,333 --> 00:06:59,208
- WOW.

104
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:02,750
( giggles )

105
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,333
- EVERYTHING LOOKS OKAY.

106
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:19,333
BUT DID YOU KNOW YOUR FRAME
HAPPENS TO BE VERY MASCULINE?

107
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:21,083
- UH...

108
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:22,666
WELL, I--

109
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,291
I HAVE A FATHER
WHO'S A MAN.

110
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:26,166
- NOW HOW CAN 
YOU BE SO RUDE

111
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,500
TO SUCH A PRETTY LADY.

112
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:31,166
COME ON.
WE CAN GO NOW.

113
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,666
- WHAT?!
- OH, EXCUSE ME.

114
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,208
NOW WHERE ARE MY MANNERS?

115
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:36,875
MY NAME IS SAGAMI
AND I'M TRAVELING BY MYSELF.

116
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,666
( chuckles )

117
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,625
OH, I DIDN'T CATCH
YOUR NAME.

118
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:42,000
- OH, MY NAME?

119
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:44,625
( clears throat )
MY NAME IS--

120
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:46,625
IS TENKO.

121
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:48,333
- OH, TENKO, HUH?

122
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:49,916
WHAT A PRETTY NAME.

123
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,375
YOU KNOW, TENKO, YOU SORT OF
REMIND ME OF MY MOTHER.

124
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:54,666
- HEY, TENKO.
- HUH?!

125
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,125
- LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE POPULAR.

126
00:07:57,208 --> 00:08:00,208
- WELL NOW.
YOUR NAME'S SAGAMI?

127
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:03,375
THESE STUDENTS ARE
MY RESPONSIBILITY, YOU KNOW.

128
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:06,541
SO KEEP IT A FRIENDSHIP,
OKAY?

129
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,166
- WHY CERTAINLY, SIR.

130
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:11,875
- THIS GUY'S GOOD.

131
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:15,708
- SEE YOU LATER.

132
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:18,708
- HEY, MOVE QUICKLY.

133
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:21,291
- UH, OKAY.

134
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:23,958
- ( alarm blares )

135
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:28,041
- HEY, WHAT'S WRONG?

136
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,708
- WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE?

137
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,916
- UH, NOTHING, REALLY.

138
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,083
- JUST EMPTY YOUR POCKETS.
- YEAH, OKAY.

139
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:36,125
I MEAN, I CAN'T THINK
OF ANYTHING

140
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:37,750
THAT WOULDN'T PASS
A SECURITY CHECK.

141
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:40,083
THIS CAN'T BE IT.
THIS IS NOTHING DANGEROUS.

142
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:43,166
- THAT'S A GALAXY POLICE
BLASTER!

143
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,083
- OR IS THIS THE PROBLEM
OR IS THIS?

144
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:48,083
OR COULD IT BE THIS?
I DON'T KNOW.

145
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:51,833
- ( gasps )

146
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:54,500
- NOW ALL WE HAVE TO DO
IS GET AN ENTRY PERMIT 

147
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:55,750
AND THEN SMOOTH SAILING.

148
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:57,416
NO PROBLEM.

149
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,416
- ( alarm blares )
- HUH?

150
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,750
- THAT IS A FABULOUS SHIP,
ISN'T IT?

151
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:04,875
- ( alarm blares )
- Both: HUH?

152
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,291
- WHAT NOW?

153
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:09,625
- THIS DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.

154
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:11,791
- WE'D BETTER GET GOING.

155
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:13,625
- WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

156
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,791
- WE'VE GOT TO
GET BACK TO YAGAMI.

157
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,958
IF THEY FOUND OUT
OUR SHIP'S TRUE IDENTITY,

158
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:19,166
IT'S OVER!

159
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:25,000
- WELL, IT LOOKS AS IF
WE'VE FOUND THEM, SIR.

160
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:27,750
AN INSPECTION OFFICER
HAS LOCATED ONE FOR SURE.

161
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,458
- SWITCH THE SECURITY SYSTEM
TO MODE "A."

162
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:32,958
- SEEMS WE'RE HAVING TROUBLE
WITH THE SECURITY SYSTEM.

163
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:35,083
IT'S NOT FULLY FUNCTIONAL.

164
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:36,833
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE. 

165
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:38,125
SWITCH OVER TO
THE BACKUP SYSTEM.

166
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:41,083
- WE'RE TRYING TO SWITCH
TO THE BACKUP SYSTEM.

167
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:44,000
- ( alarm blares )
- ( crowd murmurs )

168
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,750
- WHERE IS HE?
WHERE DID TENCHI GO?

169
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:48,458
- HELP ME!

170
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:50,625
- SOMEBODY PLEASE,
HELP ME!

171
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:54,500
RYOKO!
- AAH!

172
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:56,583
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
GET AWAY FROM ME.

173
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:59,041
- HEY, RYOKO,
DON'T YOU REMEMBER?

174
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:00,666
YOU SAID WE'D DIE TOGETHER?

175
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,166
- YOU'RE CRAZY.
I NEVER SAID THAT.

176
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,458
- DID TOO.

177
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:08,500
- AHH.
THIS IS SO GREAT.

178
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:10,583
I'M A LUCKY GUY
TO HAVE TEA

179
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,333
WITH TWO BEAUTIFUL GIRLS
LIKE YOU.

180
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:14,125
- ( chuckles )

181
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:16,083
- MAKE YOURSELVES COMFORTABLE
AND SIT DOWN, WON'T YOU?

182
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:19,833
AIRPORT FOOD DOESN'T
USUALLY SUIT MY TASTE,

183
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:23,125
BUT THIS CAFETERIA
IS AN EXCEPTION.

184
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:25,041
THE FOOD HERE IS
USUALLY QUITE GOOD.

185
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,166
- I THINK THAT I'D
LIKE TO HAVE SOME JUICE.

186
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,250
- I'LL TAKE A CAFE OLE.

187
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:32,125
- AS YOU WISH,
MADEMOISELLE. 

188
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:34,666
- UH...

189
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,375
( sighs )

190
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:38,750
- ( panting )

191
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,250
- STOP!

192
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:46,083
- RYOKO!
- TENCHI, THERE YOU ARE.

193
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,208
- MIHOSHI'S COMING TOO.

194
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:49,541
- ( grunts )
- ( gasps )

195
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,541
- HELLO THERE.

196
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,083
MY NAME'S TENKO.

197
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,875
IS THERE A PROBLEM,
OFFICER?

198
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:56,541
- THEY KNOW WHO WE ARE!

199
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:01,500
- HUH?

200
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:03,958
- GET OUT OF OUR WAY!

201
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:05,958
- OH-OH!

202
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:09,333
- WHOA!

203
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,750

204
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,833
HUH.

205
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:22,416

206
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:28,125

210
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:38,750
( grunts )

211
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:39,708
- OH!

212
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,916
- HMM.

213
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,250
- AAH!

214
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,833
- HEY.

215
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,625
- COME ON. HURRY.

216
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:08,458
- OKAY.
- WAIT FOR ME!

217
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:09,833
- ( all panting )

218
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:15,625
- Both: HUH?

219
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:18,583
- GREAT, SO WHICH WAY
DO WE GO NOW?

220
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:21,583
- WE SHOULD GO RIGHT.

221
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,500
- WE SHOULD GO LEFT THEN.

222
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,916
- HUH?

223
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:30,958
- THE SWITCH TO
THE BACKUP SYSTEM

224
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,833
IS ALMOST COMPLETE.

225
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:39,291
- WHOA!

226
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:42,083
- TENCHI, WE'RE TRAPPED. 
COME AND HELP US, TENCHI.

227
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,000

I CAN'T GET OUT.

228
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:45,541

236
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:04,208

237
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,500

238
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:08,000
TO DISCUSS THAT DECISION!

239
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:10,416

326
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,416
- WE'RE OKAY, AYEKA.

327
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,666
- I THINK THEY
MUST REALLY BELIEVE

328
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,041
THEY CAN GET AWAY FROM US.

329
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:17,041
GO AHEAD.

330
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:23,500
- ( both gasp )

331
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,125
- WHOA!
- HUH?

332
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:50,666
- ( all gasp )

333
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:55,750
- YAGAMI!

334
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,083
- OKAY, RYO-OHKI.

335
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:03,458
- ( meows )

( meows )

338
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:19,791
- WHAT?!

339
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:22,541
THERE'S NO WAY
THIS CAN BE HAPPENING.

340
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:24,666
NO WAY!

341
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:43,250
- ( gasps )

342
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:45,208
UNCLE?!

343
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:53,083
UNCLE HAS HELPED US ESCAPE.

344
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:54,333
- Both: HUH?

345
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:56,000
- ( crying )

346
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:02,375
- WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
THEY'VE MANAGED TO ESCAPE.

347
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:05,166
- THANK YOU FOR HELPING THEM.

348
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,166
- I HAD FUN DOING IT.

349
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,375
DO YOU THINK...

350
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,500
THAT THEY'LL ACTUALLY 
MAKE IT TO JURAI, SIR?

351
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:15,500
- IT'S ALL UP TO 
THE PRINCESS NOW.

352
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:18,833
OH...

353
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:21,833
YOU HAVE GROWN SO MUCH,
SASAMI.

ONCE UPON A TIME

378
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:26,000
THERE WERE TWO LOYAL KNIGHTS
WHO FOUGHT

379
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:27,416
TO PROTECT
THE EMPEROR OF JURAI.

380
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,291
AFTER THE FINAL BATTLE,

381
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:32,291
THEY SEALED THEMSELVES
INTO A LONG, LONG SLEEP.

382
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:35,416
THE LEGEND HAS IT THAT THEY
WILL BE RISEN FROM THEIR SLEEP

383
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,000
TO FIGHT ONCE AGAIN ALONGSIDE

384
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:39,041
THE TRUE EMPEROR OF JURAI

385
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:41,583
WHEN JURAI'S ROYAL FAMILY
IS FACED WITH CRISIS.

386
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:43,291
THE NAMES OF
THE TWO KNIGHTS ARE...

387
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:46,458
- Tenchi: COMING UP NEXT IS
"NO NEED FOR KNIGHTS."

388
00:23:46,541 --> 00:23:49,041
- Kiyone: IT'S UNQUESTIONABLY
A GRAND RESURRECTION.
