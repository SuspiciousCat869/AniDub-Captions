26
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:54,875
- SONIA...

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,666
- PRINCESS AYEKA
HAS MANAGED

28
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,666
TO PASS THROUGH OUR CHECKPOINT
AND ENTER INTO JURAI TERRITORY.

29
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,750
HIS MAJESTY YOSHO
IS MOST UPSET

30
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:08,750
ABOUT THIS FAILURE
IN DEFENSE.

31
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:11,708
UPDATE US WITH
HIS CURRENT STATUS, ADMIRAL.

32
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:13,708
- YES.

33
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:16,416
AS YOU CAN SEE,
MY ARMADA IS DEPLOYED

34
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,750
TO COVER THE ENTIRE
JURAI PLANETARY SYSTEM

35
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:20,250
IN SEARCH OF HER.

36
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:21,916
IT IS ONLY
A MATTER OF TIME

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,916
UNTIL WE CAPTURE
PRINCESS AYEKA.

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,875
- YO!

39
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:37,750
- FINALLY, WE'RE
IN JURAI TERRITORY.

40
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:39,875
- YES.
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T BELIEVE

41
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:41,833
WE MANAGED
TO MAKE IT THIS FAR.

42
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:44,916
- YEAH, WITH ALL THE THINGS THAT
HAPPENED DURING OUR JOURNEY.

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,750
- INDEED.

44
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,583
- I JUST HOPE OUR LUCK
HOLDS OUT

45
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:51,250
TILL WE CAN PROVE
OUR INNOCENCE, AYEKA.

46
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:53,708
- SO DO I, TENCHI.

47
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:56,833
- THEN YOU CAN RETURN TO THE 
JURAI ROYAL FAMILY IN SAFETY,

48
00:02:56,916 --> 00:03:00,750
AND THE REST OF US CAN FINALLY
GO HOME TO PLANET EARTH.

49
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:02,541
- UH...

50
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:06,125
HMM.

51
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:07,791
- WHAT IS IT, AYEKA?

52
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:09,791
IS ANYTHING WRONG?

53
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:11,208
- OH.

54
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,791
NO, THERE'S NOTHING WRONG.

55
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:16,791
- THANKS, MIHOSHI.

56
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,583
IT'S MY TURN
TO TAKE THE SHIFT NOW.

57
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:20,791
- ( snoring )

58
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:23,666
- JUST HOW MANY HOURS A DAY
DOES SHE NEED TO SLEEP, REALLY?

59
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,625
- ( beeping )
- HMM.

60
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,458
OH, NO.

61
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:39,416
- THAT'S A CONFIRMATION, SIR.
THAT SHIP IS YAGAMI.

62
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,208
- VERY GOOD.
COMMENCE ATTACK IMMEDIATELY.

63
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:43,666
WE CANNOT LET THEM ESCAPE.

64
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,583
- WE CAN'T GET OUT.

65
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,458
- OHH!  I'M REALLY SORRY!

66
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:53,750
- YOU'RE SORRY?  JUST HOW LONG
A NAP DID YOU TAKE THIS TIME?

67
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:57,083
- IT'S NO USE.
WE CAN'T SHAKE THEM.

68
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:59,541
- WE'VE GOT TO.
- THERE MUST BE A WAY, KIYONE.

69
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:02,666
- THERE'S A CLUSTER OF STARS
AT 25 DEGREES STARBOARD.

70
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:06,000
WE NEED TO HEAD OUR SHIP
TO THE CENTER OF IT.

71
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:08,416
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT, GRANDPA?

72
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,125
- HURRY UP NOW,
OR THEY'LL CATCH UP WITH US.

73
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:13,958
- I DON'T THINK SO.
I HAVE NO DATA ON IT.

74
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:16,958
YOU SEE?  NOTHING SHOWS UP
ON THE SPACE MAP.

75
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:20,166
- THE SACRED PLACE.

76
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,125
- OH, NO, IT CAN'T BE.

77
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:23,875
I THOUGHT THAT WAS
JUST A LEGEND.

78
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:25,875
- THE SACRED PLACE?
- OF JURAI?

79
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:27,916
- WHAT ON EARTH IS IT,
ANYWAY?

80
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,250
- THE SACRED PLACE IS THE
FORBIDDEN SPACE

81
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,250
IN JURAI TERRITORY

82
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:32,875
WHERE NO ONE IS ALLOWED
TO ENTER.

83
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:34,958
- HEY, THAT'S PERFECT.
I SAY LET'S GO.

84
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,250
- NO WAY.  THE PLACE
IS FORBIDDEN, RYOKO.

85
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:38,541
WE CAN'T GO IN THERE.

86
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:40,333
- WE CAN'T WORRY
ABOUT THAT NOW.

87
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:42,833
- ( explosion )
- ( screaming )

88
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,958
- COME ON, HURRY!

89
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:49,208
- THE TARGET
HAS CHANGED COURSE.

90
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:51,875
WE'LL BE BREAKING INTO THE
SACRED PLACE IF WE FOLLOW THEM.

91
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,750
- WHAT?
- SHALL WE PURSUE THEM, SIR?

92
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,250
- NO, WE CAN'T DO THAT.

93
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:59,458
WE HAVE TO CONTACT HEADQUARTERS
AND GET PERMISSION FIRST.

94
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,250
- YES, SIR.

95
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:04,000
- AND WE WERE SO CLOSE
TO CATCHING THEM.

96
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:16,833
- THIS IS THE SACRED PLACE.

97
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,083
LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE
NOT FOLLOWING US.

98
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:20,375
- ( all sigh )
- GOOD WORK, KIYONE.

99
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:23,500
NOW IF YOU'LL ADJUST OUR COURSE
ABOUT SEVEN DEGREES DOWN,

100
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,791
WE SHOULD SEE A PLANET
AHEAD OF US, I THINK.

101
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,375
- HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS?

102
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:30,333
- AH, I'M TIRED,
AND WE'LL GET SOME REST THERE.

103
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:33,750
OLD BONES GET TIRED EASILY,
YOU KNOW, TENCHI.

104
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:42,708
- LORD KATSUHITO,
ARE WE TRULY HEADING FOR--

105
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,625
- I THOUGHT WE PROBABLY
SHOULD HAVE

106
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:47,208
YOUR ORIGINALS JOIN OUR FORCE.

107
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:50,458
SO I'M TAKING YOUR LIVES
IN MY CUSTODY

108
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:51,916
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

109
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,625
- WHO ARE YOU REALLY?

110
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:57,708
- I AM THE ONE YOU THINK I AM.

111
00:05:57,791 --> 00:06:00,416
- GRANDPA, GRANDPA,

112
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,000
HOW DO YOU KNOW
ALL THESE THINGS ANYWAY?

113
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:05,708
ABOUT THE CLUSTER OF STARS,
AND THE SACRED PLACE OF JURAI?

114
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:07,583
HOW DO YOU KNOW, GRANDPA?

115
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,625
- I'LL TELL YOU, TENCHI.

116
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:15,333
THERE WERE A FEW THINGS
I WAS HOPING

117
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,791
THAT YOU WOULD NEVER
NEED TO KNOW,

118
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:20,583
HOWEVER, IT JUST MAY BE
YOUR DESTINY

119
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:23,416
TO KNOW THEM AFTER ALL.
- HUH?

120
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,916
- LISTEN, TENCHI,
WHATEVER HAPPENS FROM NOW ON,

121
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,125
YOU STAND FIRM
AND FACE YOUR DESTINY

122
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:31,458
WITHOUT FEAR,
BUT WITH COURAGE.

123
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:33,125
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

124
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:35,083
- YOU WILL UNDERSTAND

125
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:37,500
IN GOOD TIME, TENCHI.

126
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:46,666
- GRANDPA.

127
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:50,708
- I WONDER IF
THAT PLANET'S

128
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:53,625
THE ONE WHERE LEGEND SAYS
THE TWO KNIGHTS ARE SEALED IN.

129
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:55,416
- THE TWO KNIGHTS, AYEKA?

130
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,000
- YES, IT'S ONE OF THE LEGENDS
HANDED DOWN

131
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:01,500
BY JURAI'S ROYAL FAMILY.

132
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:04,541
ONCE, A LONG, LONG TIME AGO,
THERE WERE TWO KNIGHTS

133
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:08,291
WHO FOUGHT TO PROTECT
THE KING OF JURAI.

134
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:23,083
THE TWO KNIGHTS HAD GREAT
STRENGTH HIDDEN WITHIN THEM.

135
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:26,791
SUCH GREAT STRENGTH IT IS SAID
THEY COULD SHATTER STARS.

136
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:28,458
WHEN THE BATTLE WAS OVER,

137
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:30,500
THEY PUT THEMSELVES
INTO A SLEEP.

138
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:35,125
THE LEGEND HAS IT

139
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:37,458
WHEN JURAI'S ROYAL FAMILY
IS IN DANGER,

140
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,625
THEY WILL RISE
FROM THEIR SLEEP

141
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,166
TO FIGHT ALONGSIDE

142
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,833
THE CURRENT JURAI KING.

143
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:45,625
OH!

144
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:50,916
- WELL, ALL RIGHT, ALREADY,

145
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,333
SO HOW MUCH FARTHER
DO WE HAVE TO GO?

146
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:54,750
- PATIENCE.
WE'RE ALMOST THERE NOW.

147
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:57,833
- WHAT IS IT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
AT THE END OF THE ROAD?

148
00:07:57,916 --> 00:07:59,708
- THE HANDS THAT WILL HELP.

149
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:01,166
- HMM?

150
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,916
- ON OUR OWN, WE ARE NOT
POWERFUL ENOUGH

151
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,083
TO ENTER THE JURAI PALACE

152
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,375
SO IT IS NECESSARY
FOR US TO GET SOME HELP

153
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:10,500
AND IT WILL BE THE MOST
POWERFUL HELP OF ALL.

154
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:20,125
- ( all gasp )

155
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,916
- THE HELPING HANDS
I'M COUNTING ON

156
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,833
ARE OVER THERE.  LOOK.

157
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:38,208
- Ryoko: EVEN I GET THE CREEPS
IN THIS PLACE. IT'S SPOOKY.

158
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:40,833
- Mihoshi:
IT SURE IS. I'M SCARED!

159
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,208
- ( gasps ) HEY, LOOK.

160
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:41,000
- ( clattering )

161
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:48,333
- WAIT A MINUTE.
ARE THEY-- HMM.

162
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:54,166
- HMM, I SEE.

163
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:57,166
- I KNEW IT.

164
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,458
GRANDFATHER, TELL ME,

165
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:01,875
WHO ARE YOU REALLY?

166
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:05,916
- ARE YOU TWO READY NOW?

167
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,208
- ( both ) YES, SIR.

168
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:25,875
- VERY WELL.  LET'S PROCEED.

169
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:02,208
- ( screams )

170
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,291
- IT IS JURAI'S POWER.

171
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:17,375
- ( shouts )
- ( explostion )

172
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:39,416
- OH!

173
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:57,875
- ( gasping )

174
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:02,958
- AZAKA AND KAMIDAKE
HAVE BEEN RESURRECTED.

175
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:04,375
- HUH?

176
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:07,208
- I SEE NOW OUR GUARDIANS
HAVE BEEN PROGRAMMED

177
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:09,583
WITH THE PERSONALITIES
OF THOSE TWO KNIGHTS.

178
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:13,041
THE TWO KNIGHTS LOYAL
TO JURAI'S ROYAL FAMILY,

179
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,333
AZAKA AND KAMIDAKE.

180
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:28,000
- MY LORD, WE HAVE RISEN
FROM THE SLEEP OF HADES.

181
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,708
- OH, OUR EMPEROR,
THE KING OF JURAI.

182
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:33,416
- ( all gasp )

183
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,125
- NOW DON'T MISUNDERSTAND ME.
I'M NOT THE KING OF JURAI.

184
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,083
- SUCH A THING
IS NOT OUR CONCERN.

185
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:58,208
FOR WE KNOW THAT WITHOUT
THE RIGHTEOUS JURAI POWER,

186
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:01,041
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE
TO AWAKEN US, MY LORD.

187
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,916
- I RECOGNIZE THE POWER
YOU POSSESS

188
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,458
IS NO LESS THAN THAT
OF JURAI KING THE FIRST,

189
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:07,625
AND WE ARE HERE
TO SERVE YOU.

190
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:10,000
- IT IS TRUE I AM NOT
THE KING OF JURAI.

191
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:13,500
HOWEVER, I WILL ADMIT THAT
I AM A LINEAL DESCENDANT

192
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,291
OF THE JURAI ROYAL FAMILY.

193
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:16,541
- GRANDPA!

194
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,916
- MY NAME IS YOSHO,

195
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,958
THE MAN WHO ONCE DESERTED
JURAI'S ROYAL FAMILY.

196
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,958
- INCOMING COMMUNICATION
FROM THE ARMADA, SIR.

197
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:33,083
- PUT IT ON SCREEN.

198
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:35,000
- THE COUNCIL HAS GIVEN
ITS PERMISSION.

199
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,916
RESUME PURSUIT IMMEDIATELY.
- YES, SIR.

200
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,791
USE ANY MEANS NECESSARY

201
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:41,708
TO IMMOBILIZE THE PRINCESS AYEKA

202
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:44,458
UNTIL THE ARMADA ARRIVES.
UNDERSTOOD?

203
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:45,958
- I UNDERSTAND, SIR.

204
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:58,375
- Yosho: ONE DAY AFTER A LONG
AND WANDERING JOURNEY,

205
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:00,458
I ARRIVED ON PLANET EARTH.

206
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:05,125
I WAS ALONE
AND GRIEF-STRICKEN.

207
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:08,333
THE EARTH SEEMED A GENTLE PLACE
TO MY EYES.

208
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,125
DEVOUT PEOPLE ON A PLANET

209
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:13,791
IN THE FAR REACHES
OF THE UNIVERSE.

210
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:15,875
I DECIDED TO REMAIN
ON EARTH

211
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,916
UNTIL THE END OF MY DAYS.

212
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,291
I MET MY WIFE
AND THROUGH MARRIAGE WITH HER,

213
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:24,041
I BECAME THE SON-IN-LAW
OF THE KEEPER

214
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:25,833
OF THE MASAKI SHRINE.

215
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:29,750
IT WAS THEN THAT I WAS GIVEN
THE NAME KATSUHITO MASAKI.

216
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:33,166
OF COURSE,
I IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED

217
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,708
IT WAS WASHU SEALED
IN MASAKI SHRINE.

218
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:38,666
I WAS SURPRISED TO FIND
THE LEGENDARY MAD SCIENTIST

219
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,708
HAD DRIFTED ASHORE
ON SUCH A REMOTE PLANET.

220
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,833
- HEY, THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
I'VE EVER HEARD ALL THIS.

221
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,458
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL
ME THIS STORY

222
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:53,000
WHEN I MARRIED
YOUR DAUGHTER?

223
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:56,166
- YOU MEAN I SHOULD HAVE TOLD
YOU I WAS FROM OUTER SPACE?

224
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,500
NOW REALLY.

225
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:00,500
- SO THAT MEANS I'M--
- THAT'S RIGHT.

226
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:03,666
YOU'RE ALSO LINEAL DESCENDANT
OF THE JURAI ROYAL FAMILY.

227
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,291
- REALLY?

228
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,708
- TENCHI IS A DESCENDANT

229
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,750
OF JURAI.

230
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:13,375
- THAT MAKES THE YOSHO ON PLANET
JURAI A FAKE, DOESN'T IT?

231
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:15,125
- YEAH, BUT HE'S GOTTA
BE CONNECTED

232
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:17,708
TO JURAI'S ROYAL FAMILY
IN SOME WAY, I BET.

233
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:20,750
- WELL, WELL, GRANDPA,
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT?

234
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:22,541
YOU'RE QUITE SOMETHING
TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HIDE

235
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:24,458
THE JURAI'S POWER YOU POSSESS

236
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:27,125
FROM MY EYES ALL THIS TIME.
- ( laughs )

237
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:29,625
- BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO HIDE
ANYTHING ANYMORE NOW.

238
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:33,416
YOU KNOW THE TRUE IDENTITY
OF OUR ENEMY, DON'T YOU?

239
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,875
- HMM.  HUH?

240
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,083
- ( shouting )
- THEY'RE HERE.

241
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:47,500
- STAY WHERE YOU ARE.  IT IS
IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO ESCAPE.

242
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:50,958
- Mihoshi: WE'VE GOTTA RUN.
- Noyobuki: YEAH, BUT RUN WHERE?

243
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:52,958
- RYO-OHKI!
- ( screeching )

244
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:02,125
- ( screaming )
- OH, NO, RYO-OHKI.

245
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:03,250
- RYO-OHKI!

246
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:04,875
- ALL RIGHT, WE'VE
RESTRAINED RYO-OHKI.

247
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:07,458
PREPARE TO ATTACK!
- YES, SIR.

248
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:12,083
- LET US DEAL WITH THEM.

249
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,791
- YOU DON'T NEED TO WORRY NOW.

250
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:18,916
- ( gasps ) MM-HMM.

251
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,625
- LET'S GO, KAMIDAKE.
WE NEED SOME EXERCISE.

252
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,625
- OH, YEAH!  FIRE!

253
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:27,708
( screaming )

254
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:43,291
- ( screeching )
- OH!

255
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:45,833
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT,
RYO-OHKI?

256
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:48,833
- WELL, THAT WAS QUITE EASY,
ACTUALLY.

257
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,708
- PRINCESS, YOU'RE NOT HURT,
ARE YOU?

258
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:56,458
- NO, I'M OKAY, THANKS.

259
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:20,958
- THEY AREN'T DEAD,
ARE THEY?

260
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:28,000
- THEY'VE SACRIFICED THEMSELVES
DISCHARGING ALL THEIR ENERGY

261
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:31,500
IN ORDER TO RESURRECT
THE TWO KNIGHTS.

262
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:35,208
- THE TWO YOU HAVE SERVED WELL
FOR SO LONG ON OUR BEHALF.

263
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:37,083
I THANK YOU.

264
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,291
- AND NOW WE WILL
TAKE OVER YOUR WORK

265
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:44,041
AND AT LAST,
YOU CAN REST IN PEACE.

266
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,958
- I THANK YOU.

267
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:51,333
AZAKA, KAMIDAKE.

268
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,541
NOW YOU CAN REST.

269
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:08,708
- I AM AZAKA,
A KNIGHT OF JURAI.

270
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:10,208
- AND I AM KAMIDAKE.

271
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:11,916
- AND FROM NOW ON,

272
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,708
WE PLEDGE OUR ALLEGIANCE
TO YOU.

273
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:17,041
- MY LORD,
WE CAN SEE IT CLEARLY

274
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:20,125
AND ARE CERTAIN OF THE ONE WHO
WILL CARRY ON THE NOBLE CAUSE.

275
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:23,458
- INDEED
AND I'M COUNTING ON YOU.

276
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:34,875
- I SEE, SO THEY LOST THEM
IN THE SEALED LAND.

277
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:36,583
- YES, SIR.

278
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:39,125
- I UNDERSTAND.  YOU MAY GO.

279
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:41,000
- YES, YOUR MAJESTY.

280
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:00,333
- ( laughing )

281
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:03,125
THE SEAL OF THE TWO KNIGHTS
CAN ONLY BE BROKEN

282
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:05,750
BY THE JURAI KING.

283
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:09,750
YES,
HE HAS RETURNED FINALLY.

284
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,416
I LOOK FORWARD
TO MEETING YOU

285
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:15,166
IN PERSON, YOSHO.

286
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:18,125
( laughing )

287
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,916
- NOW REALLY, HOW MANY
HOURS OF SLEEP A DAY

288
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,083
CAN MIHOSHI POSSIBLY NEED?

289
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:33,125
- Sasami: THERE.  TAKE THAT.
- Azaka: YOU CAN'T BEAT ME! 

290
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:35,333
- GOTCHA!

291
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:37,625
- YOU BEAT ME AGAIN,
PRINCESS.

292
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:39,541
- YOU JUST HAVE TO PRACTICE.

293
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,708
- I LOSE FACE EVERY TIME
I PLAY THIS GAME.

294
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:45,041
- WELL, AZAKA, OF COURSE,

295
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:47,416
WE DIDN'T HAVE
TOYS LIKE THIS IN OUR DAY.

296
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,083
- PRINCESS, ONE MORE TIME?

297
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,791
PLEASE ALLOW ME ONE MORE TIME,
YOUR HIGHNESS.

298
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:52,958
- OKAY.

299
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:55,583
TENCHI IS A DESCENDANT

300
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:57,666
OF JURAI ROYAL FAMILY.

301
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,666
