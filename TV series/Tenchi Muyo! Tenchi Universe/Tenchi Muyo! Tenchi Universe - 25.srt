26
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:11,875
COME TO ME NOW, CROWN PRINCE,
OF THE JURAI ROYAL FAMILY.

27
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:15,541
COME FACE ME AND TASTE
THE BLOOD OF YOUR DEFEAT.

00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:18,333
( laughing )

29
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:23,791
- NO, TENCHI.
IT IS TOO DANGEROUS HERE.

30
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:25,583
( panting )

31
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:43,000
- ( shouts )

32
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:48,916
- NOW THAT'S PATHETIC.

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,250
YOU WEAKLINGS
ARE NO MATCH FOR NAGI.

34
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:06,958
- JUST LIKE OLD TIMES.

35
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:09,625
THIS PLACE HASN'T
CHANGED A BIT.

36
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:12,916
- NO, NOT AT ALL.
- THAT'S STRANGE.

37
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,750
THEY DON'T SEEM TO HAVE ANY
SECURITY GUARDS HERE, HUH? 

38
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:18,000
- THAT'S BECAUSE THEY DON'T
HAVE ANY NEED FOR THEM.

39
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:19,708
- WHY?
- DON'T YOU SEE?

40
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:21,583
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY
NO ONE IN THIS UNIVERSE

41
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:24,041
THAT CAN HARM
THE EMPEROR OF JURAI.

42
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:26,000
- INDEED.
JURAI'S EMPEROR CONTROLS

43
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:27,833
THE MOST POWER
IN THE UNIVERSE.

44
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,583
- ALSO, ALL THE PREVIOUS
EMPERORS OF JURAI

45
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:32,416
HAVE ALWAYS HAD THE MOST
POWERFUL KNIGHTS

46
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,500
LIKE OURSELVES AROUND
TO PROTECT THEM.

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,583
- YOU SEE?
THERE'S ONE NOW.

48
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:40,541
( shouting )

49
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:48,625
OH.  GUESS I CAN'T FOOL
A KNIGHT OF THE ROYAL COURT.

50
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:51,083
NEVER THOUGHT I'D SEE
YOU TWO IN PERSON.

51
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:54,666
- YOU MUST BE A KNIGHT UNDER
THE CURRENT EMPEROR OF JURAI.

52
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,458
- THAT'S RIGHT.
I AM TETTA.

53
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:58,958
- THEN LISTEN UP, TETTA.

54
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:02,166
THIS IS THE RIGHTFUL CROWN 
PRINCE OF THE PLANET JURAI.

55
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,125
- YEAH, SO WHAT?

56
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:08,291
- I SEE.  YOU KNEW THAT
ALREADY, OF COURSE.

57
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:10,291
WELL, THEN THERE'S
NOTHING MORE TO SAY.

58
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:13,208
WHEN YOU SERVE A VILLAIN,
YOU ARE NOT A TRUE KNIGHT

59
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:15,458
AND IT'S MY DUTY TO BRING
PUNISHMENT DOWN UPON YOU.

60
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:17,541
PLEASE PROCEED,
YOUR HIGHNESS. 

61
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,583
AND, KAMIDAKE, GUARD HIM WELL.

62
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:21,291
- RIGHT.

63
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:26,291
- STOP RIGHT THERE.

64
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:31,625
- AND NOW, REBEL SCUM,
YOU DEAL WITH ME.

65
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,750
- LET'S HURRY
AND MOVE THE FLEET NOW.

66
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:57,000
HAVE THE MAGICAL FORCE
FIELD SATELLITES READY

67
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:58,541
AND AWAIT MY ORDER.

68
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:11,083
- WHAT IS THIS?

69
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:15,708
- STAY RIGHT THERE.

70
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:17,458
- WHEN ALL SHIPS
TAKE THEIR POSITIONS--

71
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:19,375
- Hi.
- WHAT?

72
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:20,750
Well, since we have a heated
battle going on here,

73
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:22,375
we thought we should
check up on you,

74
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:25,208
see how you're doing.
- JUST WHAT ARE YOU?

75
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,791
- WHAT I AM IS WASHU THE BEST
SCIENTIFIC GENIUS

76
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,375
IN THE UNIVERSE.

77
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:32,833
I'VE GOT THIS STATION
UNDER SIEGE, ADMIRAL.

78
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:36,291
YOU'D BETTER ORDER THAT
BATTLE FLEET OF YOURS TO STOP.

79
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:37,750
AND DO IT RIGHT NOW

80
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:41,375
OR I'LL INJECT MY HOMEMADE
SUPER COMPUTER VIRUS

81
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:43,500
INTO YOUR SYSTEM!
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

82
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,625
- ( laughing )

83
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:47,416
IT WILL DESTROY
THE BATTLE TACTICS PROGRAM

84
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,416
OF JURAI'S ENTIRE
MILITARY SYSTEM.

85
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,416
- CLOSE OFF ALL CIRCUITS
IMMEDIATELY.  HURRY.

86
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,416
- YES, SIR.  RIGHT AWAY.

87
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,833
- I don't think so.
It's too late for that.

88
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:58,166
- START THE SELF-DESTRUCT
PROGRAM FOR THAT STATION.

89
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,750
- RIGHT AWAY, SIR.
- A self-destruct program?

90
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:06,625
- ( alarm blaring )
- ( groaning )

91
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:12,166
- ALL RIGHT.  BE THAT WAY.

92
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,416
I'VE GOT A PRESENT FOR YOU.

93
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,833
- COME ON.
YOU GOTTA GET OUTTA HERE.

94
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:25,458
- ( groaning )

95
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:30,875
- ( laughing )

96
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:38,458
- THE WHOLE SYSTEM'S OUT
OF CONTROL!  IT DOESN'T WORK!

97
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:41,000
- ATTENTION ALL SHIPS THAT
HAVE ESCAPED THE EFFECTS

98
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:44,333
OF THE VIRUS.  TRACK DOWN
THE ENEMY AND DESTROY THEM.

99
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,375
- I GOT YOU. 
( screaming )

100
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:01,416
- PIECE OF CAKE!

101
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,541
- THAT'S NOT BAD.

102
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:29,958
- STAND BACK NOW!

103
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,666
- KAMIDAKE!

104
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:49,208
KAMIDAKE?

105
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:51,541
- HE IS QUITE STRONG.

106
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:55,541
THE THRONE ROOM
IS JUST AHEAD OF US.

107
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,333
 LET ME DEAL WITH THIS ONE.

108
00:07:57,416 --> 00:08:00,291
YOU JUST GO GET THAT
FAKE EMPEROR.

109
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:16,333
- TENCHI, GO NOW, QUICK!

110
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:18,666
- OK, RIGHT.

111
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:26,333
- WHAT'S YOUR NAME, WARRIOR?

112
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:28,583
- I'M TESSEI.

113
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:33,708
- IS THAT ALL
A LEGENDARY KNIGHT CAN DO?

114
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:37,375
YOU KNOW,
GIVEN THAT PERFORMANCE

115
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,166
YOU'D HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF
SLEEPING FOREVER.

116
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:10,208
- WHAT WAS THAT?

117
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:13,666
- IT'S JURAI'S NEEDLE.

118
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:16,250
THE SKILL WAS NOT YET
AVAILABLE DURING YOUR TIME.

119
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:18,166
- ( growls )

120
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:27,583
- ( panting )

121
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:48,625
- TENCHI, I'M HERE!

122
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,791
- AYEKA!

123
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:57,041
- HELLO, THERE.

124
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:05,625
- HMM.
THEY SURE ARE PERSISTENT.

125
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:11,333
GUESS I SHOULD GET GOING.
LET'S GO!

126
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,875
FIRE NOW!

127
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:29,625
SEE YA! ( laughing )

128
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:42,583
- I'VE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD
TO MEETING YOU.

129
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:52,291
- SWORD, TENCHI.

130
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:54,416
WELL, I GUESS YOU MUST BE
IN THE LEGITIMATE LINE,

131
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,166
BUT ONLY IF YOU ARE
ABLE TO USE IT.

132
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,500
- I COULDN'T CARE LESS 
ABOUT THAT FAMILY TREE.

133
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:02,166
WHAT I DO CARE ABOUT
IS TAKING AYEKA WITH ME.

134
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,333
- YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

135
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:06,291
ALL YOU HAVE
TO DO IS DEFEAT ME

136
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,541
AND YOU CAN DO
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

137
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:19,250
SO KILL ME.

138
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,416
- ( screaming )

139
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:42,916
- NO!  TENCHI!
- ( groaning )

140
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:01,250
- ( screaming )

141
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,791
- TENCHI.

142
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,958
( groans )

143
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:20,041
- YOU'VE DISAPPOINTED ME,
YOU KNOW.

144
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:21,583
YOUR SWORD IS WEAK

145
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:24,583
AND I THOUGHT THE JURAI POWER
WOULD BE SO MUCH GREATER.

146
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:29,666
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE
NOT MORE CAPABLE.  HYAH!

147
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,791
( shouting )

148
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:38,083
- SPEAK TO ME, TENCHI!

149
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:40,541
SPEAK TO ME!

150
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,625
- YOU ARE PRETTY GOOD,

151
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:49,875
BUT YOU'RE NOT GOOD ENOUGH
TO DEFEAT US.

152
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:51,875
YOU SEE,
BOTH YOU AND YOUR MASTER

153
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:55,250
ARE MISSING ONE
IMPORTANT ATTRIBUTE.

154
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,500
- WHAT YOU ARE MISSING

155
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:59,666
IS THE NOBLE SPIRIT
THAT RESPECTS CHIVALRY,

156
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,000
WITHOUT WHICH YOU DON'T
DESERVE TO BE CALLED KNIGHT,

157
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:03,625
LET ALONE JURAI'S EMPEROR.

158
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:06,166
- WHO CARES?

159
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,375
- YOU STILL DON'T GET IT,
DO YOU?

160
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:11,291
( shouting, grunting )

161
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:23,041
( screams )

162
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:29,333
- SEE?  YOU SIMPLY DIDN'T
DESERVE TO BE A JURAIAN KNIGHT.

163
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:56,208
- IT'S OVER!

164
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:06,416
- ( groans )

165
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,416
- ( laughs )

166
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:14,833
( screaming )

167
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:54,666
- ( gasps ) YOU'RE HURT, KIYONE.
ALL RIGHT, WE SURRENDER!

168
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:55,958
WE GIVE UP!

169
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:58,625
- IT LOOKS LIKE THIS IS
AS FAR AS WE CAN GO.

170
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:01,958
- I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT AND NOW
THE REST IS UP TO TENCHI.

171
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:04,333
- ( crying )
YOU CAN DO IT, TENCHI.

172
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,750
- HOW PATHETIC.

173
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:21,000
AND YOU, A DIRECT DESCENDENT
OF JURAI'S ROYAL FAMILY.

174
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:23,583
- ( grunting )
WHAT IS IT--

175
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,958
WHAT IS IT THAT YOU WANT?

176
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:32,500
- WELL, WHAT DO YOU
THINK I WANT?

177
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:35,333
I WANT AN END
TO THE DIRECT BLOODLINE

178
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:38,583
OF JURAI'S ROYAL FAMILY.

179
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:51,458
- AYEKA!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

180
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,250
- I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU
TO KILL TENCHI.

181
00:15:57,333 --> 00:16:00,791
- YOU FINALLY EVOKED
JURAI'S POWER, EH?

182
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:10,375
- OH, TENCHI.
IT'S ALL MY FAULT, TENCHI.

183
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:12,541
I'M SO SORRY
THIS HAS HAPPENED

184
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:14,333
AND IT'S ALL
BECAUSE OF ME.

185
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:16,791
- NO, AYEKA.

186
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:19,458
- KAGATO, I'M WARNING YOU.

187
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:21,208
MOVE AWAY FROM TENCHI NOW.

188
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,208
- ( grumbles )

189
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:28,916
( laughs )

190
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,500
BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME.

191
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:34,083
( gasps )

192
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:37,750
- NO!

193
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:53,416
STOP IT, KAGATO!

194
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:59,625
YOU WON'T HARM AYEKA!

195
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,875
- WHAT?

196
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,250
WHAT IS HAPPENING?

197
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,125
- ( whimpers )

198
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:40,083
- HUH?  WHAT'S THIS?

199
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:49,958
- THIS IS THE WAY
THE EARTH LOOKS.

200
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:51,833
- THAT'S RIGHT.

201
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:54,958
TENCHI, AS SUCCESSOR
TO BOTH THE SPIRIT OF JURAI

202
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:58,833
AND OF EARTH,
YOU CAN DO THIS TASK.

203
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:03,041
I SEE IT.  I CAN SEE IT.

204
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:06,000
AYEKA AND TENCHI.

205
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:09,416
I HAVE THE SAME VISION, TOO.

206
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:42,000
- SO I SEE.  THAT IS
JURAI'S TRUE POWER.

207
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:46,166
DOES THIS MEAN THAT JURAI HAS
CHOSEN ITS OWN MASTER, THEN? 

208
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:25,416
- ( shouting )

209
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,083
- ( grunting )

210
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:33,541
- YOSHO, LOOKS LIKE
I'VE LOST AGAIN,

211
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,500
DOESN'T IT?

212
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,708
- YOU DID IT, TENCHI.

213
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:19,041
TENCHI! ( wailing )

214
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:55,958
- AND SO KAGATO,
THE MAN WHO CLAIMED

215
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:58,291
TO BE THE EMPEROR
AND KING OF PLANET JURAI

216
00:21:58,375 --> 00:21:59,791
HAD BEEN VANQUISHED.

217
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:03,500

240
00:23:57,083 --> 00:23:59,208
IT'S LIKE A CARNIVAL
EVERY DAY.

241
00:23:59,291 --> 00:24:01,291
I WISH THESE DAYS COULD
GO ON JUST LIKE THIS

242
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:04,583
FOREVER AND EVER.  TENCHI.

243
00:24:04,666 --> 00:24:07,500
- Tenchi: OH, THOSE DAYS WERE
LIKE A NEVER-ENDING CARNIVAL,

244
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:10,541
A CRAZY CIRCUS WE THOUGHT
WOULD LAST FOREVER.

245
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:13,208
IT ALL STARTED ONE DAY.

246
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:15,875
COMING UP NEXT TO CONCLUDE
THE SERIES IS...

247
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:17,500
"NO NEED FOR A CONCLUSION."

248
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:21,208
- Kiyone: IT'S UNQUESTIONABLY
THE FINAL EPISODE.
