31
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:06,458
- LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

32
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:08,708
TODAY WE ARE BRINGING YOU
THE CONCLUSION

33
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:11,166
OF "TENCHI MUYO"'S
SPECIAL EPISODES.

34
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,750
- BECAUSE THE DIMENSION TUNER
WENT OUT OF CONTROL

35
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:18,708
OUR HEROES HAVE BEEN TRAVELING
THROUGH DIFFERENT WORLDS.

36
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:23,958
HOW WILL THIS TIME
AND SPACE TRAVEL END?

37
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:27,458
- SO, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

38
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:29,291
LET US FIND OUT...

39
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:31,708

- Tenchi:
ALL RIGHT, I'M OFF.

44
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:47,583
- Mihoshi: WAIT, HONEY.
- WHAT?

45
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:50,208
- YOUR TIE ISN'T STRAIGHT.

46
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:54,541
THERE, THAT'S MUCH BETTER.
( giggles )

47
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:58,458
- BYE.
- SEE YOU THIS EVENING, BYE.

48
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:07,958
OH, SASAMI, YOU BETTER HURRY UP.
YOU'LL BE LATE FOR SCHOOL.

49
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:09,166
- COMING!

50
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,916
- THAT'S MY GOOD GIRL.

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
DO YOU HAVE
EVERYTHING YOU NEED?

52
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:13,250
- YEAH, I DO, MOM.

53
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:16,083
PLEASE DON'T FORGET
TO FEED RYO-OHKI, OKAY?

54
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:18,666
- OH NO, I WON'T FORGET
TO FEED HER.

55
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:22,750
- I'D BETTER GET GOING.
- WATCH OUT FOR TRAFFIC, SASAMI!

56
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:24,583
- I WILL!

57
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:28,625
- ( yawns )

58
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:33,958
HUH? OH, THE OLD MAID
OF THE HOUSE IS HERE ALREADY.

59
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:37,583
- ARE YOU CALLING ME
AN OLD MAID, SISTER-IN-LAW?

60
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:41,583
- UH, NO, I SAID
YOU'RE UP EARLY TODAY, HUH?

61
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,208
- YEAH RIGHT.

62
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:46,958
I KNOW I'M JUST THE OLD NAGGING
SISTER-IN-LAW, AREN'T I?

63
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:50,125
WELL, I GRIPE ABOUT LOTS OF
THINGS BECAUSE I AM RESPONSIBLE

64
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:52,208
FOR KEEPING THIS HOUSE
RUNNING, YOU KNOW.

65
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:54,541
( slurps )
EW, SALTY!

66
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:58,000
WHAT IS THE DEAL
WITH YOUR MISO SOUP ANYWAY?

67
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:00,166
- I'M SORRY.

68
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,291
- IF YOU WERE SOMEONE
I COULD COUNT ON,

69
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,541
I WOULDN'T HESITATE
TO GET MARRIED

70
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:05,958
AND LEAVE THIS HOUSE
IN YOUR CARE.

71
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:09,791
BUT LOOK AT YOU! YOU JUST
SIT AROUND AND SPACE OUT

72
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,916
ALL DAY.
HMM.

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,416
- ( moos )
- WHAT IS THIS WEIRD STUFF.

74
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,333
- WELL, IT'S CROQUETTE, SIS.

75
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:19,750
- YOU CALL THIS A CROQUETTE?

76
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:21,333
IT'S MORE LIKE A
LUMP OF CHARCOAL.

77
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:23,416
- SORRY AGAIN.

78
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,291
- MY GOODNESS. YOU KNOW,
IT'S REALLY QUITE UNBELIEVABLE

79
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:29,750
YOU JUST CANNOT GET ANYTHING
STRAIGHT, NOW CAN YOU?

80
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:30,791
( chokes, coughs )

81
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,500
COULD YOU MOVE ANY SLOWER?

82
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,500
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SPEND ALL
DAY ON THAT, YOU KNOW?

83
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,875
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
SORRY.

84
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:46,333
- WELL, LOOK HERE.

85
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:49,166
LOOKS TO ME AS THOUGH THESE
SCREENS ARE VERY DUSTY.

86
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,000
- OOH, RIGHT.

87
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,000
- AND THIS AREA IS
PARTICULARLY DIRTY.

88
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,000
- I'M COMING THERE RIGHT NOW.

89
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,750
- AND DON'T FORGET
OVER HERE EITHER.

90
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:58,958
- RIGHT AWAY, SIS.

91
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:02,208
- OH, WHAT HAVE WE HERE,
I WONDER.

92
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,125
COULD IT POSSIBLY BE
ANOTHER MESS?

93
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:06,125
- I'M COMING!

94
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:07,875
( yells, screams )

95
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:10,083
- ( both screaming )

96
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:17,416
- ( grunts ) THERE.

97
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,416
- SO TELL ME, SISTER-IN-LAW,
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME

98
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,333
YOU DID THE LAUNDRY ANYWAY?
- UH...

99
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:22,541
- HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I TOLD YOU

100
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,041
THAT YOU SHOULD DO
LAUNDRY MORE OFTEN?

101
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:25,916
- ( yawning )

102
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,750
I'M SORRY.

103
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:32,500
- OH, NOT SO MUCH, MIHOSHI!

104
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,000
YOU MUSTN'T BE SO WASTEFUL.

105
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,333
YOU SHOULDN'T WASTE
DETERGENT LIKE THAT.

106
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:38,541
- ( yawning )
I'LL BE MORE CAREFUL.

107
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:42,708
COME ON, ARE YOU REALLY
SURE ABOUT THIS, SIS?

108
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:45,708
TODAY'S NOT OUR TRASH DAY.
YOU REMEMBER?

109
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,708
- HEY, WE'RE FINE
IF WE DON'T GET CAUGHT.

110
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:49,833
- ( meowing )
- EAT UP.

111
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:56,541
( laughs ) YOU HAVE A STRANGE
NAME FOR A CAT, RYO-OHKI.

112
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,750
"WHISKERS" IS MORE LIKE
A NORMAL CAT'S NAME,

113
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,125
DON'T YOU
THINK SO, RYO-OHKI?

114
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:04,083
HUH?
- ( meowing )

115
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:06,125
- HUH! MIHOSHI!

116
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:08,750
THE MEAT MARKET
HAS A 50%-OFF SALE.

117
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,416
- HUH?

118
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,625
- TODAY!
IT SAYS IT RIGHT HERE.

119
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:14,625
- ( trumpet playing "Charge" )

120
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:19,583
- HELLO, EXCUSE ME!

121
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:21,250
500g OF ROAST PORK--

122
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:24,500
UH, NO, BEEF.
300g OF DICED BEEF.

123
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,083
PLEASE, HELLO!

124
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:28,333
CAN SOMEBODY HELP ME PLEASE?

125
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:33,041
( sighing )
I'M EXHAUSTED.

126
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:36,083
HUH?

127
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:39,166
WELL, SINCE I'M ALREADY
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD...

128
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:41,583
- ( phone ringing )

129
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:49,708
- KIYONE, YOU HAVE
A CALL ON LINE ONE.

130
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:51,166
- THANK YOU.

131
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:56,041
HELLO, THIS IS KIYONE.
HOW MAY I HELP YOU TODAY?

132
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:58,125
( growls )

133
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:01,125
- Mihoshi: I HAVE TO SAY,

134
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:04,041
MY HUSBAND'S SISTER, SHE IS
SUCH A NIT-PICKER, KIYONE.

135
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:07,125
SHE'S ALWAYS FINDING FAULT
WITH EVERYTHING THAT I DO

136
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:08,958
AND SHE YELLS AT ME
ALL DAY LONG.

137
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:10,625
OKAY, LIKE TODAY
FOR EXAMPLE,

138
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:13,458
WHEN I SAID, "WHAT'S WRONG,"
SHE SAID STUFF LIKE,

139
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:16,375
"WHAT WAS THAT CROQUETTE
YOU SERVED THIS MORNING?"

140
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:18,625
I MEAN, LIKE,
COULD YOU LIVE WITH THAT?

141
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:21,458
- OKAY, LISTEN UP. IF ALL YOU
WANT TO DO IS COMPLAIN,

142
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,583
I'VE GOT LOTS OF WORK
TO DO, YOU KNOW?

143
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:26,083
- HUH? BUT IT'S NOT LIKE

144
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,250
WE GET TO SEE EACH OTHER
THAT OFTEN, IS IT?

145
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,375
- WE'VE BEEN GETTING TOGETHER
QUITE FREQUENTLY

146
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:31,583
SINCE OUR GRADUATION.

147
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:33,500
- REALLY?
- REALLY.

148
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:36,833
- BESIDES YOU ALWAYS TELL ME
THE SAME OLD STORY

149
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:38,333
EVERY TIME I SEE YOU.

150
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:41,041
- YOU KNOW, FRUSTRATION IS
NOT GOOD FOR YOU, KIYONE.

151
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:43,250
SO WHY DON'T YOU GET
MARRIED OR SOMETHING?

152
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,666
- NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.
- EXCUSE ME!

153
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,666
I'D LIKE TO HAVE ANOTHER
CHOCOLATE PARFAIT,

154
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,625
IF YOU PLEASE.

155
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:50,500
- ARE YOU LISTENING AT ALL?

156
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:54,208
- OF COURSE I AM.
WELL, SO MY SISTER-IN-LAW,

157

SHE CALLS ALL KINDS OF NAMES,
LIKE SLOW AND DUMB AND--

158
00:07:57,666 --> 00:08:00,416
OH, I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE!

159
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,083
- I NEED A STRAWBERRY SUNDAE
HERE AND MAKE IT LARGE.

160
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,375

161
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,916

162
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,791
( sighs )

163
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:21,125

OF SOY SAUCE AGAIN.

168
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:31,750
CAN YOU SPARE US SOME, PLEASE?

169
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:34,458

I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU.

170
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:36,500
HUH?
- SORRY TO BOTHER YOU LIKE THIS.

171
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:40,500
- EXCUSE ME, WAIT A MINUTE.
I DIDN'T INVITE YOU IN, DID I?

172
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,458
- OH, NOW YOU DON'T MIND ME.

173
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:45,583
- WELL, I KNOW YOU SAY NOT
TO MIND YOU, BUT, RYOKO--

174
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:48,166
- OH, I SEE YOUR HUSBAND
HASN'T HOME YET, HAS HE?

175
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:51,083
HUH? HMM? HMM?
- THAT'S RIGHT, RYOKO.

176
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:52,791
- AHHH.

177
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:54,500
THAT WAS A LONG DAY.

178
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:56,250
- HELLO THERE, TENCHI!

- HUH? WHAT ABOUT ATAMI?

183
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,625
- MY FRIEND RUNS
A BED AND BREAKFAST PLACE THERE.

184
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:13,625
DON'T YOU WANT TO GO
WITH ME THERE, HUH?

185
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:16,083
- HOW COME YOU ALWAYS
COME OVER HERE

186
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:18,791
AND TRY TO STEAL MY HUSBAND?

187
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:21,166
- ARE YOU HERE AGAIN, RYOKO?

188
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:24,125
WHAT ARE YOU, A CAT BURGLAR?
- HERE SHE IS, THE OLD BAG.

189
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:26,125
- WHO ARE YOU CALLING
AN OLD BAG?!

190
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:28,250
RYOKO, YOU ARE A WIDOW.

191
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:29,750
WHY DON'T YOU TRY BEHAVING
LIKE ONE SOMETIME

192
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:32,125
AND ACT WITH A LITTLE MODESTY?
OH, IT IS VERY UNPLEASANT

193
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:33,791
TO SEE YOU FLIRTING
LIKE THAT.

194
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:36,541
- HMPH. IT'S VERY
UNPLEASANT TO SEE YOU

195
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,791
BEHAVING LIKE AN OLD BAG
WHO'S NEVER BEEN MARRIED.

196
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:41,708
- ( shrieks )
I CAN'T STAND YOU!

197
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:44,958
- AYEKA, RYOKO, STOP IT.

198
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:46,875
THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD
CAN HEAR YOU.

199
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:48,666
I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE!

- SEE, TENCHI?

201
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:53,625
ATAMI IS THE PLACE FOR US
TO GO AND GET MARRIED.

202
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,916
- HEY, RYOKO!

203
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,458
- COME ON, LET'S GO.

204
00:09:57,541 --> 00:10:00,708
NOW I'M SURE EVERYONE WILL
GIVE US THEIR BLESSING.

205
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:02,916

- WE'VE DONE IT, TENCHI!
HA HA!

216
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,708
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE
ROBBING A BANK, HUH?

217
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:55,500
- THIS ISN'T ME.
THIS ISN'T WHAT I DO.

218
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:57,708
WHY AM I DOING THIS?
WHAT AM I DOING HERE?

219
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:00,041
- HEY, WE'RE
HAVING FUN, AREN'T WE?

220
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,125
- I DON'T FIND THIS
AMUSING AT ALL!

221
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:05,041
- WELL, I DO!
HA HA HA HA HA!

222

228
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:37,916
DESPITE A NATIONWIDE MANHUNT
BY THE POLICE.

229
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,375
IT'S BEEN A MONTH
SINCE TENCHI MADURSKY,

230
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:43,291
THE GRANDSON OF REVEREND
MADURSKY AT SAINT MASAKI,

231
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,416
WAS KIDNAPPED BY RYOKO.

232
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,000
HIS SAFETY IS OF MAJOR
CONCERN TO THE POLICE,

233
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,958
BUT HE IS NOW A WANTED MAN,

234

SUSPECTED OF BEING RYOKO'S
CONFEDERATE IN THE SHOOTING

FINANCIAL GROUP MILLIONAIRESS

239
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:12,916
MISS AYEKA JURAI,

240
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,875
SEVERELY CRITICIZED THE
INCOMPETENCE OF THE F.B.I.

241
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:19,291
SHE ANNOUNCED THAT SHE WILL
OFFER A MILLION DOLLAR REWARD

242
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:21,125
FOR ANYONE WITH INFORMATION

243
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,625
LEADING TO THE ARREST
OF THE SUSPECT.

244
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:27,708
- YOU SHOULD HAVE CONSULTED WITH
US BEFORE YOU OFFERED A REWARD.

245
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:30,041
- YES, MISS AYEKA.
PEOPLE MIGHT GET THE IDEA

246
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:32,250
THAT WE'RE INCOMPETENT
OR SOMETHING.

247
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:34,750
- THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.
THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE--

248
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,250
INCOMPETENT!

249
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:39,416
YOU CANNOT BE IN CHARGE OF THIS
INVESTIGATION ANY LONGER.

250
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,083
- NOW WAIT A MINUTE.

251
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:43,791
JUST WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH THAT RIFLE?

252
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:45,791
- WHAT'S IT LOOK LIKE?

253
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:48,166
I'M GOING TO TAKE CARE
OF THIS SITUATION MYSELF.

254
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,750
I'M GOING TO DEAL
WITH RYOKO IN MY OWN WAY.

255
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:52,750
- ALL RIGHT, I SEE!

256
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:55,875
- AYEKA, CAREFUL.
CALM DOWN.

257
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:57,666
- LET ME GO!
- ( whimpering )

258
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:01,666
- WHILE WE WASTE TIME HERE,
TENCHI'S WITH RYOKO

259
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,166
AND I WON'T ALLOW IT!

260

00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:17,916

266

UH, HEH HEH.

267
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,125
PLEASE COOPERATE.
THANK YOU.

268
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:27,958
- MM-HMM.

269
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,333
- ( laughs )
- ( whimpers )

270
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:54,083
- ( laughs ) TENCHI?
- OH UH...

271
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,208
( sighs )

272
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:10,708
- ( growls )

273
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:24,375
- LOOK, TENCHI, THE SETO BRIDGE
IS SOMETHING ELSE, ISN'T IT?

274
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:25,750
- D'OH!

275
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,583
LOOK HERE, RYOKO,

276
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,708
THAT BRIDGE HAPPENS
TO BE THE GOLDEN GATE.

277
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:32,541
- ( laughs ) WELL, IT REALLY
DOESN'T MATTER EITHER WAY.

278
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,250
HMMM.

279
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,750
WE CAN SURE SEE A SKY
FULL OF STARS, HUH?

280
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:40,208
THE STARS ARE BEAUTIFUL.

281
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:41,500
DON'T YOU THINK?

282
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:43,625
- YEAH, I GUESS.

283
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:48,958
- WE'RE ALL ALONE UNDER
THE STARRY SKY, YOU AND ME.

284
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:51,625
- I DON'T KNOW HOW I GOT MYSELF
INTO THIS MESS.

285
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:54,458
- ( laughs )
- WHAT IS IT?

286
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:57,458
- NOTHING. IT'S JUST--

287
00:14:57,541 --> 00:15:00,916
- IT'S JUST WHAT, RYOKO?
- ( boat whistle blares )

288
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,250
- HEY, TENCHI?
- HUH?

289
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:04,750
- WE'VE GONE THROUGH
A LOT OF STUFF

290
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:06,541
SINCE WE STARTED THIS
JOURNEY, HAVEN'T WE?

291
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:09,125
- WE SURE HAVE.
- ( sighs )

292
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:12,166
I JUST LOVE STARS.

293
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,125
- ( zapping sound )
- WHAT?

294

( moans )

295
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,125
- HUH?
- WASHU, IT'S YOU!

296
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:36,666
IT'S REALLY YOU!
- LONG TIME NO SEE, TENCHI.

297
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,166
- SO YOU'VE FINALLY
FIXED THAT MACHINE?

298
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,791
- IT HASN'T BEEN EASY.

299
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:43,500
I HAD TO ELIMINATE NUMEROUS
DIFFERENT WORLDS

300
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,333
IN ORDER TO CATCH UP
WITH YOU TWO.

301
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:46,708
- ALL RIGHT!

302
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:49,166
SO NOW WE CAN RETURN TO OUR
ORIGINAL WORLD, RIGHT?

303
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,708
- WELL, THERE IS STILL
ONE PROBLEM.

304
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,208
- WHAT?

305
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:55,375
- YOU WERE THE FIRST ONE THAT
TAMPERED WITH MY MACHINE,

306
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,833
WEREN'T YOU, RYOKO?
- UH...

307
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,041
I DON'T REMEMBER.

308
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:02,125
- THIS WORLD SEEMS
TO BE REFLECTING

309
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:04,333
YOUR IDEA
OF A PERFECT WORLD.

310
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:06,750
- OH YEAH, RIGHT,
OF COURSE.

311
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,541
NO WONDER
IT'S SO MESSED UP.

312
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:11,458
- IT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME
TO ELIMINATE THIS WORLD

313
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:13,583
WITHOUT YOUR HELP, RYOKO.

314
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:15,541
YOU NEED TO RENOUNCE
THIS WORLD.

315
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:18,833
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY FOR US TO
GET BACK TO OUR ORIGINAL WORLD.

316
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:24,250
- NO WAY.
- HUH?

317
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:26,625
- I WILL NEVER DENY
THIS WORLD.

318
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:30,083
- NEVER? BUT DON'T YOU
MISS OUR ORIGINAL WORLD?

319
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:32,791
COME ON, RYOKO!
- NOT AT ALL, NO, I DON'T.

320
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:36,916
- RYOKO, YOU SHOULDN'T BE
SO SELFISH AT A TIME LIKE THIS.

321
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,875
WHY DON'T YOU WANT
TO GO BACK?

322
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:41,041
- BECAUSE I--

323
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,541
TENCHI, HAVEN'T WE HAD
SOME FUN TOGETHER?

324
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:46,750
- YOU DON'T GIVE ME ANY CHOICES.
HOW CAN I ANSWER THAT?

325
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:49,000
- I THOUGHT THIS WORLD WAS
BEGINNING TO GROW ON YOU,

326
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:50,583
TENCHI.

327
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:52,708
ISN'T IT, AT LEAST A LITTLE?
- THAT'S YOUR WISHFUL THINKING!

328
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:54,541
- YES, I HOPED!

329
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:57,666
I BELIEVED WE HAD
A DEEP BOND BETWEEN US.

330
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,833
I WISHED FOR THAT,
I ADMIT IT.

331
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:02,458
NOW TELL ME
I WAS WRONG, TENCHI.

332
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:04,333
DO YOU HATE THE IDEA

333
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:06,500
OF CONTINUING TO TRAVEL
WITH ME SO MUCH?

334
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:09,958

THIS IS THE WORLD I DESIRE.

OKAY, LET'S GO.

360

TO THIS WORLD, RYOKO.

ANY TIME YOU ARE.

OTHERWISE WE'LL NEVER
MAKE IT BACK.

WE'VE BEEN TO KYOTO
AND A NORTHERN FISHING VILLAGE

I THOUGHT IT WAS KINDA FUN.

389

- ( giggles )
YEAH, IT WAS!

390
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:33,625
- YOU TWO ARE CAREFREE,
SO OF COURSE YOU HAD FUN.

391
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:35,458

ALL OF THIS WAS CAUSED

BY THAT RIDICULOUS
STUPID RYOKO.

HUH? RYOKO?!

WHERE COULD SHE BE?
- SHE'S NOT AROUND, HUH?
