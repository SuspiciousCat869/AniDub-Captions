HAVE YOU COME TO PAY
RESPECT TO THE SHRINE?

- I'M SASAMI.

69

I'VE COME TO FIND
MY OLDER SISTER. 

70
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:10,041
- SO YOU'RE CALLED SASAMI,
HUH?

00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,500
THAT'S SURE A CUTE NAME.

- ( giggles )

73
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:17,416
HMM!

74
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:22,333

- HMM?

80
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:41,083
WHAT'S WRONG, TENCHI?

81
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:43,083
YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU'VE JUST SEEN A GHOST.

82
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:45,250
DID YOU MEET A LEPRECHAUN
IN THE WOODS?

83
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:48,250
- I THINK I DID,
ACTUALLY.

84
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,625
- HMM?

85
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:57,000
TENCHI,
THE GIRL YOU SAW,

86
00:05:57,083 --> 00:06:00,583
SHE MAY NOT BE A PHANTOM
OR A MAGICAL LEPRECHAUN.

87
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:05,000
- YOU CAN TELL JUST BY
HEARING MY STORY, GRANDPA?

88
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:06,541
- HMM.

89
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:09,125
WELL, IT'S FAIRLY EASY
FOR SOMEONE LIKE ME

THIS SORT OF THING.

94
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:19,916
NOW I SEE HER
IN MY MIND'S EYE.

95
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,916
OH, SHE HAS HER HAIR
TIED ON BOTH SIDES. 

96
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,250
- WOW, GRANDPA.
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I SAW!

97
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,625
- AND SHE HAS SOME
FRECKLES ON HER CHEEKS.

98
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:32,291
- MM-HMM, MM-HMM.
YEAH, RIGHT, FRECKLES!

99
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:33,625
- TENCHI!

00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:36,583
SHE'LL SHOW UP HERE
VERY SOON.

101
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:38,750
- WHAT?! REALLY?!

102
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:41,708
- SO...

103
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,958
YOU ENJOY COOKING,
HEY, SASAMI?

104
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:46,458
- OH YEAH.

GETTING PRETTY QUICK WITH
THE GIRLS THERE, TENCHI.

110
00:06:56,708 --> 00:07:00,375
- HOW COME SASAMI IS HERE?

111
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:04,166
- BECAUSE SASAMI IS THE
LITTLE SISTER OF AYEKA,

112
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:07,333
AND SHE'S COME TO
TAKE AYEKA HOME. 

113
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:08,750
- OHH!

114
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:10,458
AYEKA'S YOUR SISTER.

115
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:13,500

- SASAMI, HOW DID YOU
GET HERE BY YOURSELF?

119
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:32,333
SO, THIS IS THE END
OF MY HOLIDAY.

120
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,208

122
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:50,041
NOW I CAN FINALLY GO HOME.

123
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:52,250
- I'M GLAD FOR YOU,
MIHOSHI.

124
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,125
- NOW DIG RIGHT IN.

125
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:56,583
HAVE SOME DRINKS AND EAT
AS MUCH AS YOU WANT.

126
00:07:56,666 --> 00:08:00,208
YOU AND AYEKA ARE OUR
GUESTS OF HONOR TONIGHT.

127
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:02,041
- THANK YOU ALL
SO VERY MUCH.

128
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:05,666
- ( laughs )

129
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,041
- MISS AYEKA.

130
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:09,083

131
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:12,500
( sighs )

132
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,458
- HEY, RYOKO,

133
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:17,208
IS THAT ALL YOU CAN EAT?

134
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:21,208
- I DON'T HAVE MUCH
OF AN APPETITE TONIGHT.

135
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:25,666
- YOU MUST HAVE EATEN
TOO MANY SWEET POTATOES, RYOKO.

136
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:29,583
- BUT I REALLY CRAVE
SOME PICKLES AND ICE CREAM.

137
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,416
- PICKLES AND...

138
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,625
( gasps )
RYOKO, MY GOODNESS,

139
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:36,083
CAN IT MEAN THAT
YOU ARE PREGNANT?!

140
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:38,875
- ( all gasp )

141
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,250
- I THOUGHT YOU'D BEEN PUTTING
ON SOME WEIGHT LATELY.

142
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:43,833
- THEN THAT MUST BE IT.

143
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:46,291
YOU KNOW WHAT CAUSES PREGNANCY,
DON'T YOU?

144
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:48,083
- WELL, YES.

145
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:50,958
- WOW. I CAN'T WAIT
TO SEE THE BABY.

146

00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:58,041
( gags )

148
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:01,333
- ( baby cries )

149
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,750
- THE BABY IS BORN.

150
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:10,083
THE BABY I MADE
WITH TENCHI.

151
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:12,500
- ( all gasp, scream )

152
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:17,333
- WELL DONE, TENCHI!

153
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:19,875
I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT YOU WERE
RATHER SLOW TO MATURE,

154
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:21,625
BUT NOW I'M SO HAPPY
TO SEE YOU'VE GROWN 

155
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:22,708
INTO A HEALTHY MAN!

156
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:24,250
I'M PROUD OF YOU,
TENCHI.

157
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:26,125
- CONGRATULATIONS,
TENCHI.

158
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:28,000
- I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU.

159
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:29,458
- ( both laugh )

160
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,000
- IT'S A MISTAKE,
I TELL YOU!

161
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:32,791
RYOKO, YOU BETTER
TELL THE TRUTH RIGHT NOW,

162
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,083
I'M NOT KIDDING!

163
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:37,458
- OOH, YOU DON'T HAVE TO
BE SO EMBARRASSED,

164
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:40,416
TENCHI, DADDY.

165
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,666
- SO, I GUESS I'M A GREAT 
GRANDFATHER NOW, AREN'T I?

166
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,333
- OOH!
MY FIRST GRANDCHILD.

167
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:48,291
- ( groans )

168
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:49,666
MISS RYOKO!

169
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,458
YOU DO NOT REALLY EXPECT US

170
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,833
TO BELIEVE THAT EGG
IS YOURS, NOW DO YOU!

171
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:56,875
- WELL I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND

172
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:59,375
HOW YOU CAN BE SO
VERY CRUEL TO ME.

173
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:00,833
- SHE'S RIGHT.

174
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:02,500
IT'S SO CRUEL TO SAY
SUCH A THING.

175
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:04,333
POOR RYOKO.

176
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:06,666
- OH, AYEKA'S JUST
TRYING TO PICK A FIGHT

177
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,375
SO SHE CAN RUIN THAT 
SPECIAL HAPPY FEELING

178
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:10,583
WE ALL SHARE.

179
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,833
- AND YOU ARE ANNOYING
LORD TENCHI.

180
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:15,166
- YOU JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW MEN ARE.

181
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,333
HE'S REALLY VERY HAPPY INSIDE.
- ( groans )

182
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,291
- OH, NO I'M NOT!

183
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:20,791
- I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

184
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:23,708
I WILL NEVER BE CONVINCED
IT'S YOURS UNLESS I SEE PROOF.

185
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,833
- IF YOU MUST KNOW,
TENCHI AND I MADE LOVE,

186
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,500
AND THIS EGG HERE WAS BORN.

187
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,625
WHAT OTHER PROOF
DO YOU NEED?

188
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,583
- MADE LOVE?

189
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,791
( stammers )

190
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:41,708
WE'LL SEE WHAT KIND OF
EGG IT IS WHEN WE BREAK IT!

191
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,500
- NO, YOU WON'T. 
STOP IT, STOP IT,

192
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,208
STOP IT, STOP IT.
HEY, STOP IT!

193
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,833
- OH, PLEASE, AYEKA.

194
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:50,416
- AAH!
( gasps )

195
00:10:57,041 --> 00:11:00,875
- ( all gasp )

196
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:04,166
- OH NO.
THE EGG IS--

197
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,041
THE EGG IS SMASHED.

198
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:07,166
- OH.

199
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:10,791
- ( stutters )
MY FIRST GRANDCHILD.

200
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:17,291
- ( all gasp )

201
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:23,250
- ( meows )

202
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:27,125
- WOW.

203
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:28,750
- YO!

204
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,583
- ( giggles )
MY DEAR,

205
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:46,916
OUR FIRST GRANDCHILD IS BORN.

206
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,583
WELL, SHE'S NOT 
THE TYPICAL KIND

207
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,916
YOU NORMALLY WOULD EXPECT,

208
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,750
BUT SHE'S HEALTHY
AND SHE LOOKS JUST LIKE TENCHI.

209
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,333
- I FAIL TO SEE 
THE RESEMBLANCE!

210
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:56,333
- HERE.
- ( meows )

211
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:57,791
- A PERFECT MATCH.

212
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:59,291
- SASAMI...

213
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:00,958
- OH, WOW.  IT'S TRUE.

214
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:04,458
- TENCHI, YOU MAKE SURE
YOU RAISE HER WELL.

215
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:05,625
- DAD.

216
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:08,625
- ( meows )

217
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:10,625
- ARE YOU HUNGRY?

218
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:14,375
WOULD YOU LIKE THIS?

219
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:16,625
- ( sniffs )

220
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:18,625
( chews, meows )

221
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:20,291
( meows )

222
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,750
- ( laughs )

223
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:29,500
SHE NEEDS A NAME,
DOESN'T SHE?

224
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:30,791
I KNOW!

225
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:31,958
WHAT ABOUT TENKO,

226
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:34,291
THE CHILD OF TENCHI
AND RYOKO?

227
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:36,291
- ( spits )

228
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:39,291
IT'S NOT MY CHILD!
( crying )

229
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,000
- OH, SORRY.

230
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:44,500
RIGHT.  WELL THEN,
WHAT SHOULD WE NAME HER?

231
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:46,000
- RYO-OHKI.

232
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:47,333
- HUH?
- HUH?

233
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:50,083
OH, GOOD MORNING, RYOKO.

234
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:53,083
I'VE GIVEN HER THE NAME
RYO-OHKI.

235
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:54,833
- RYO-OHKI?

236
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:57,166
OH, NOW IF I REMEMBER
CORRECTLY,

237
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:00,458
I THINK THAT'S THE NAME
OF YOUR SPACESHIP, RYOKO.

238
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,666
- ( meows )

239
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,875
- AH, I'M IMPRESSED
YOU REMEMBER THAT. 

240
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,541
- ( gasps )
THAT MEANS THAT...

241
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:14,958
THAT MEANS THAT YOU MUST REALLY
LIKE THE NAME OF RYO-OHKI.

242
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,083
( giggles )

243
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:17,375
- ( meows )

244
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,041
- ( crying )

245
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:51,250
- WOW.

246
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:53,708
SO THIS IS YOUR SPACESHIP,
SASAMI?

247
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,375
- WELL, I GUESS
IT'S TIME TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

248
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:57,458
I'LL MISS YOU.

249
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:59,458
I'LL BE GLAD TO
ESCORT YOU PART-WAY,

250
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:00,708
IF YOU WANT?

251
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:02,541
- ( scoffs )
WITHOUT A SHIP?

252
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:05,708
- HMM.
THAT'S NO PROBLEM.

253
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:08,625
RYO-OHKI.  WHA--?

254
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:10,583
- ( meows )

255
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:11,583
- BAHH!

256
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,333
- ( chews, meows )

257
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:16,583
- HEY NOW.
KNOCK IT OFF.

258
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:18,375
I'LL LET YOU EAT
ALL YOU WANT LATER.

259
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,291
- AH.

260
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:22,583
SO IT'S JUST
AS I SUSPECTED.

261
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:24,750
SHE IS A CHILD OF RYO-OHKI,
ISN'T SHE?

262
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,750
SHE IS THE NEW RYO-OHKI.

263
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:29,291
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
MISS AYEKA?

264
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,583
- HM.

265
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:32,250
I'LL SHOW YOU!
- ( meows )

266
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:33,583

267
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:36,208
- WHOA!

268
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:52,541
- All: WOW!

269
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,208
- WELL, WHAT DO YOU KNOW,
RYO-OHKI IS A SPACESHIP. 

270
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:57,458
- WELL, LET'S GO AHEAD
AND MOVE 'EM OUT.

271
00:14:57,541 --> 00:15:00,333
- NOT WITH YOU,
I ASSURE YOU.

272
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:02,666
- OH, PLEASE?
IT WOULD BE SUCH A HELP.

273
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,875
YOU KNOW, I'M TOLD IT'S NOT

274
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:05,791
AS SAFE AS IT USED TO
BE AROUND HERE.

275
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:07,208
- YIPPEE!

276
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:09,291
RYO-OHKI'S COMING
PART-WAY WITH US.

277
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,791
- SASAMI, MIHOSHI,

278
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:12,125
WE ARE LEAVING.

279
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,666
- WAIT FOR ME,
AYEKA.

280
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,375
- PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME BEHIND.

281
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:21,000
OH, RYOKO,

282
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:23,125
I'M COUNTING ON YOU
TO BEAT UP THE SPACE PIRATE

283
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:24,916
IF YOU SEE HER, OKAY?

284
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,791
- CAN YOU BELIEVE
SHE HAS COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN

285
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,833
THAT I AM THE SPACE PIRATE?

286
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:31,166
- VERY EASILY.

287
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,166
- ( meows )

288
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:46,250
- BYE.
NOW YOU BEHAVE YOURSELVES.

289
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,666
- GOSH.

290
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,625
I CAN NO LONGER SEE
TENCHI'S HOUSE FROM HERE.

291
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,541
- ( sighs )

292
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:18,541
UH...
I COULD HAVE...

293
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:21,166
- DID YOU SAY SOMETHING,
AYEKA?

294
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,166
- OH...
NO, NOTHING.

295
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,416
- I BET YOU WERE THINKING 
ABOUT TENCHI, WEREN'T YOU?

296
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,166
- WELL, I--

297
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,500
- YOU'RE BLUSHING.

298
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,041
AYEKA, I KNEW IT.

299
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:32,875
♪ YOU WERE IN LOVE
WITH TENCHI. ♪

300
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,625
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,
SILLY?

301
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:37,416
- WHAT?!
YOU, MISS AYEKA?

302
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,875
- UH, MIHOSHI, YOU TOO?

303
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,083
- I GUESS THAT'S WHY
YOU HAVE THINGS LIKE THIS

304
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:43,625
IN YOUR LUGGAGE.

305
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:45,416
- WOW.

306
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,833
- IT'S JUST A SOUVENIR
PICTURE.

307
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:50,916
- COME NOW,
DON'T BE SHY ABOUT IT.

308
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,875
- WHY NOT COME
RIGHT OUT AND SAY IT?

309
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:55,416
- YOU SHOULD!
YOU SHOULD. GO ON, SAY IT!

310
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,791
- OH, YOU'RE IMPOSSIBLE.

311
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,916
OH, DON'T STARE
AT ME LIKE THAT, PLEASE.

312
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,250
IF YOU ONLY KNEW.

313
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:09,208
I JUST-- OH...

314
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:11,208
- HELLO?

315
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:13,916
- OH, NO, LORD TENCHI.
- EXCUSE ME?

316
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,583
- HUH? UHH...

317
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:18,125
- SORRY, DID I DO
SOMETHING WRONG? 

318
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:20,458
- OH, LORD TENCHI.

319
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,458
- LISTEN, AYEKA,

320
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,333
I BET YOU HAVE
TONS OF SUITORS BACK HOME.

321
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:26,916
AM I RIGHT?

322
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,333
SO, WHY DON'T YOU JUST
LEAVE TENCHI TO ME THEN?

323
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,375
HUH?

324
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:35,208
- LISTEN, LORD TENCHI...

325
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:44,458
I AM AYEKA, THE FIRST PRINCESS
OF THE JURAI ROYAL FAMILY.

326
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:47,708
YOU MUST UNDERSTAND I HAVE
MANY OBLIGATIONS, TENCHI. 

327
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:51,250
- I UNDERSTAND.

328
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:54,958
- SO YOU SEE, I JUST CAN'T
STAY ON THE EARTH FOREVER.

329
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:57,166
- I KNOW.

330
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:01,250
- I ENJOYED EVERY MINUTE
I SPENT ON THE EARTH, TENCHI.

331
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:02,750
I CLOSE MY EYES

332
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:05,166
AND I CAN REMEMBER ALL THE
WONDERFUL THINGS,

333
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,916
LIKE THE BEAUTIFUL AUTUMN LEAVES
I WATCHED WITH YOU,

334
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,625
THE DELICIOUS TASTE OF
THE SWEET POTATO YOU GAVE ME.

335
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:13,625
- MISS AYEKA.

336
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:17,083
- OKAY, OKAY.  THAT'S ABOUT
ENOUGH OF THAT, YOU TWO.

337
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:20,333
- I WILL NEVER EVER
FORGET YOU, LORD TENCHI.

338
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:22,083
- NOR WILL I.

339
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:25,541
- LORD TENCHI, I--

340
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:28,000
THE FEELING
I HAVE FOR YOU...

341
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:29,416
- HUH?
- HMM?

342
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,333
- NO.

343
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:34,333
IT'S NOTHING, TENCHI.

344
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:36,625
- LET HER GO, TENCHI.
COME ON.

345
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:38,208
- MISS AYEKA,

346
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:39,750
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF,

347
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:41,791
AND HAVE A SAFE
JOURNEY HOME.

348
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:43,166
- I--

349
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,750
I THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

350
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:47,333
FAREWELL, LORD TENCHI.

351
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:49,000
BE GOOD.

352
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:51,125
FOREVER AND EVER.
( crying )

353
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,250
I DID THE RIGHT THING.

354
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:59,458
- BLEHH!

355
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:03,833
- WE ARE NOW PREPARING 
FOR FINAL ACCELERATION.

356
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:09,208
- PREPARATION COMPLETED.

357
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:11,583
WE AWAIT YOUR ORDERS,
PRINCESS AYEKA.

358
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:14,000
- FULL SPEED TO
PLANET JURAI.

359
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,125
- YES, MA'AM.

360
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:17,375
- HUH?

361
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,875
- OH, WHAT'S THAT
CARROT FOR, SASAMI?

362
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:24,250
- THAT'S THE CARROT
RYO-OHKI WAS EATING

363
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:25,375
A FEW MINUTES GO.

364
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:27,375
- ( meows )

365
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:31,333
- NOW LET'S GO BACK TO OUR
LITTLE LOVE NEST, TENCHI. 

366
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:32,791
AHH?

367
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:35,083
- ( meows )

368
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:43,083
- WHAT IS THIS? 
WHAT'S GOING ON?

369
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:45,250
- ( meows )

370
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:47,416
- ( both grunt )

371
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,875
- ( alarm blares )

372
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:50,708
- ( both gasp )

373
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:54,291
- RED ALERT!
RED ALERT!

374
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:56,250
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

375
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:59,208
- ( meows )

376
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:02,333
- RYO-OHKI IS HEADING 
STRAIGHT FOR OUR SHIP.

377
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:04,500
- LOOK OUT, AYEKA!

378
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,291
- WHAT?!

379
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:07,916
- ( meows )

380
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,208
- UH...
- WHAT?

381
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,166
- ( meows )

382
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:30,791
- WHY DOES IT HAVE TO
BE LIKE THIS?

383
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,208
( sighs )

384
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:34,625
- ( meows )

385
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:36,625
- WOW, DELICIOUS.
- ( meows )

386
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,458
- I'M JUST GLAD 
I'M STILL ALIVE.

387
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:40,250
- LOOKS LIKE WE'RE
GROUNDED HERE ON EARTH

388
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:41,625
FOR AWHILE.

389
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:45,583
IF ONLY SASAMI HAD NOT
FOUND THAT CARROT UP THERE.

390
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:47,291
- HERE, MISS AYEKA.

391
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:50,208
BUT BE CAREFUL BECAUSE WELL,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

392
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,458

THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

394

WHAT DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE DOING?

396
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:03,166
- NOTHING.  NOTHING AT ALL
AS YOU CAN SEE THAT, CAN'T YOU?

397
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,666
- NOTHING, HUH?!

398
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,000
- AND ANYWAY,
IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

399
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:10,166
- HERE, TENCHI.
IT'S GOOD.

400
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,458
- AHH!

401

00:23:28,583 --> 00:23:31,041
LEGEND HAS IT THAT
IT BRINGS HORRENDOUS DISASTERS

432

TO THE FACE OF THE EARTH.

HEY, RYOKO,
ARE YOU LISTENING OR WHAT?

I'VE BROKEN THE SEAL.
