- I'M SO SORRY.

160
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:41,125
- ( beeping )

161
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:43,083
- MR. MANAGER,
WE'VE GOT AN EMERGENCY.

162
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:46,333
CAN WE PLEASE LEAVE EARLY?
- EARLY?! NOT AGAIN!

163
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:48,458
- COME ON, MIHOSHI,
LET'S GO.

164
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:50,541
- OKAY.

165
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:55,000
- HEY, COME BACK HERE.

166
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:00,250
- ( police siren blares )

167
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:09,083
- THAT EMERGENCY CALL CAME
FROM SOMEWHERE NEAR JUPITER.

168
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:10,708
LET'S GO.
WE'VE NO TIME TO LOSE.

169
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,458
- RIGHT.

170
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:17,166
COULD THIS BE AN ARMED ROBBERY
OR A SPACE MAFIA CASE?

171
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,708
THIS IS EXCITING.

172
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,458
- BEFORE YOU GET
TOO EXCITED,

173
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:22,041
CHANGE INTO YOUR UNIFORM.

174
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,708
( sighs )

175
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,666
CAN YOU HOLD THAT THING?

176
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,416
I'LL TRY TO OPEN UP
THIS VALVE HERE.

177
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,166
- UM, THIS THING HERE?

178
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,125
LIKE THIS?

179
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:47,000
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

180
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:53,333
- ( machine whirrs )

181
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:57,875
- YEAH, YOU FIXED IT.

182
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:59,416
- ( sighs )

183
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,750
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

184
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:01,916
I WAS VERY WORRIED.

185
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,791
MY SHIP BROKE DOWN
IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE

186
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:05,625
AND I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS GONNA DO.

187
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,500
- DON'T MENTION IT.

188
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:08,875
- TO BE A RESIDENT OFFICER

189
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:11,083
MUST BE QUITE
A DIFFICULT JOB, HUH?

190
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:13,541
- WE'RE JUST DOING
OUR DUTY, MA'AM.

191
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:16,500
- HOW ABOUT STAYING HERE 
AND MARRYING MY GRANDSON?

192
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,333
WHAT DO YOU THINK,
YOUNG LADY?

193
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:20,416
- ( giggles )
I'M SO FLATTERED.

194
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,875
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK,
KIYONE?

195
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:25,833
- ( nervous chuckle )

196
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,875
- YO!

197
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:33,708
YO!

198
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,916
- ( train whistles )

199
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,375
( train rattles )

200
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,541
- I AM SO BEAT.

201
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:52,708
- WE'RE VERY EXHAUSTED.

202
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:55,000
- ( cars honking )

203
00:10:58,583 --> 00:10:59,708
- ( doorbell rings )

204
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:02,416
- HUH, I HOPE IT'S NOT
ANOTHER SALESMAN. 

205
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,833
- YES?

206
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,291
- OH WOW.
- SURPRISE!

207
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:10,958
- HI, EVERYONE.

208
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:14,625
- HI. WE JUST CAME BY TO
SEE HOW YOU GUYS ARE DOING.

209
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:17,083
- YEAH, WE MISS YOU GUYS.
SO HOW ARE YOU?

210
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:18,166
- ( meows )

211
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,208
- WE BROUGHT ALONG
A LITTLE SOMETHING

212
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:21,416
FOR YOU TO EAT, HERE.

213
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,416
- Ryoko: YOU BROUGHT
THEM JUNK FOOD.

214
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,916
- WOW, YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE.

215
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,125
- Ayeka: DID YOU SAY SOMETHING?
- HMM.

216
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:26,208
- I AM NOT TALKING
TO YOU ANYMORE.

217
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:28,083
- STRAIGHTEN UP THE ROOM,
WILL YOU?

218
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:29,083
- ALL RIGHT.

219
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:31,083
- PLEASE, COME
INSIDE, WON'T YOU?

220
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,583
- HURRAY! LET'S GO INSIDE!

221
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:37,375
- I AM SO GLAD YOU CAME OVER.
IT'S REALLY GREAT TO SEE YOU.

222
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:38,541
( giggles )

223
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:41,541
- SO THIS IS MIHOKIO'S PLACE,
IS IT?

224
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,000
- MIHOKIO?

225
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:45,708
- THAT'S SHORT FOR 
MIHOSHI AND KIYONE.

226
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,708
- WELL, I DON'T
LIKE THE SOUND OF IT.

227
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,458
- YEAH, IT SOUNDS
LIKE THE NAME

228
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:52,166
OF A GOOFY COMEDY TEAM
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

229
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,625
- HEY, GOOFBALL,
SHUT UP ALREADY.

230
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:57,583
- YOU SURE ARE LIKE CLOWNS.
- YEAH.  ( giggles )

231
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:59,458
- ( laughing )

232
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:01,333
- UM.

233
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:07,458
- ( sighs ) YOU KNOW,
IT REALLY WARMS MY HEART

234
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:08,833
TO SEE YOU BOTH
DOING SO WELL. 

235
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:11,375
- UH-HUH, AND WE'RE SO HAPPY
AND FULL OF ENERGY.

236
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:12,875
- SPEAK FOR YOURSELF.

237
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:15,833
OF COURSE YOU'RE ENERGETIC,
YOU SLEEP ALL THE TIME.

238
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,791
- WELL, I'M NOT SLEEPING NOW.
- ( meows )

239
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:20,583
- NO, YOU CERTAINLY AREN'T.
- ( laughing )

240
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:23,000
- TELL ME. HOW HAVE YOUR
JOBS BEEN COMING ALONG?

241
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:25,333
- WELL, BECAUSE
OF THIS RECESSION,

242
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:26,958
THINGS AREN'T EASY.

243
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:29,958
WE'RE ACTUALLY THINKING OF
GETTING ANOTHER PART-TIME JOB.

244
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:33,583
- ( muffled ) HM-HMM.
SURE SOUNDS TOUGH.

245
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:35,125
( slurps) AH.

246
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:36,833
- ( both gasp )

247
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:39,291
- HUH?

248
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:42,416
- LISTEN, RYOKO, JUST BECAUSE
THIS IS THE LAST ONE,

249
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,083
DOESN'T MEAN YOU
HAVE TO GET SO COMPETITIVE.

250
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:47,041
- THE SAME
COULD BE SAID OF YOU.

251
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:50,166
AREN'T WE BEHAVING 
A WEE BIT GLUTINOUS

252
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,791
FOR THE PRINCESS
OF PLANET JURAI?

253
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:54,000
- ( giggles )
I WOULDN'T THINK OF IT.

254
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:55,625
OH, PLEASE BE MY GUEST, RYOKO,

255
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,583
HELP YOURSELF TO THE LAST PIECE.
I INSIST.

256
00:12:57,666 --> 00:12:59,250
- HEY, TENCHI.

257
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:01,625
ALTHOUGH SHE'S ACTING
AS THOUGH SHE'S GENEROUS,

258
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:05,250
DID YOU KNOW AYEKA
HAS ALREADY HAD 10 CRACKERS?

259
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:07,958
DON'T THINK I DIDN'T NOTICE.
I COUNTED.

260
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:09,416
- HUH?

261
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,833
WELL, I GUESS IT
DOESN'T BOTHER YOU

262
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,625
TO BE THOUGHT OF
AS A COOKIE-COUNTER.

263
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,666
- NOT ONLY THOSE CRACKERS.

264
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:15,916
SHE'S ALSO BEEN MUNCHING

265
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,916
ON POTATO CHIPS,
AND CHOCOLATE PUFFS, AND STUFF

266
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,333
ALL BY HERSELF.

267
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:20,375
WHAT A PIG, HUH?

268
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:22,875
- LIES! LIES! 
IT'S NOT TRUE!

269
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:24,541
- IT IS TOO.

270
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:27,250
YOU SAW HER STUFFING YOURSELF,
DIDN'T YOU?  HUH?  RIGHT?

271
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:28,583
- HEY, LET GO.

272
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:31,000
- HUH? WHAT ARE YOU
DOING WITH TENCHI?!

273
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:32,083
LEAVE TENCHI ALONE.

274
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,333
YOU GO SIT OVER THERE
RIGHT NOW.

275
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:35,541
- COME ON, RYOKO.

276
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:38,291
- IT'S ONLY NATURAL
FOR LOVERS TO CUDDLE.

277
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:39,750
ISN'T IT, TENCHI?

278
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:40,916
 - ( growls )

279
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:43,541
- ( screams )

280
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,458
OH NO! STOP IT.

281
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,416
YOU SHOULDN'T BE DOING
THAT IN HERE.

282
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,000
- HEY, STOP THAT.
CUT IT OUT.

283
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:54,708
- ALL RIGHT,
THIS HAS TO BE SETTLED.

284
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:56,708
- YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT
ANYBODY BUT YOURSELF

285
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:58,666
AND I'VE HAD
QUITE ENOUGH OF IT.

286
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:02,041
I WON'T STAND IT ANYMORE.

287
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:04,333
- YOU'RE CAUSING US
TROUBLE NOW.

288
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:06,750
- PLEASE, WE BEG YOU,
BOTH OF YOU,

289
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,000
TAKE YOUR FIGHT OUTSIDE.

290
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,833
AAH!

291
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:13,083
HA!

292
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:17,208
- ( grunts )

293
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:20,791
- ( screams )

294
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:23,083
- ( all screaming )

295
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:24,750
- ( screams )

296
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:25,750
- ( screeches )
- ( meowing )

297
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,583
- STOP IT!

298
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,416
- Ryoko: ( shouting )

299
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,958
- ( all screaming )

300
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:40,208
- ( chuckles )

301
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:41,500
- ( crying )

302
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:46,416
- ( chewing )

303
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,500
( slurps )
MM-MM.

304
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:52,500
YEAH, THIS IS GOOD TEA.

305
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,208
- ( sighs )

306
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:10,125
THAT WAS SOMETHING ELSE.

307
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:12,625
- YES, IT WAS.

308
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:17,750
- ( yawns )

309
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,625
AH. SOAKING IN A HOT TUB
IS THE BEST.

310
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:22,416
IT'S THE PERFECT WAY
TO RELAX.

311
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,958
- ( giggles ) YEAH.

312
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:25,541
YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN.

313
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:28,208
- BUT I THOUGHT YOU WERE
ALWAYS RELAXED, MIHOSHI.

314
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:31,833
- YEAH, YOU THINK SO?
- ( laughs ) DEFINITELY.

315
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:35,041
- ( blows bubbles )

316
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:39,041
- ( humming )

317
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:49,500
( humming )

318
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:50,833
- ( through bubbles )
