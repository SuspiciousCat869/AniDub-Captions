25
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:11,000
-Tenchi: AND SO KAGATO,
THE MAN WHO CLAIMED

26
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:13,833
TO BE THE EMPEROR
AND KING OF PLANET JURAI

27
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:15,541
HAD BEEN VANQUISHED,

28
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:18,833
AND I SUPPOSE THAT WAS WHEN
I REALIZED FOR THE FIRST TIME

29
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:21,833
THE REASON WHY GRANDPA DECIDED
NOT TO TAKE THE THRONE.

30
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,541
WE WERE PROVEN
INNOCENT OF TREASON

31
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:50,208
AND ALL OTHER CHARGES

32
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:54,125
AND AYEKA WAS FREE TO BECOME
ONE OF JURAI'S ROYAL FAMILY.

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,916
THE TRUTH WAS FINALLY BROADCAST
ALL OVER THE UNIVERSE,

34
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,291
AND OF COURSE, CAUSED QUITE
A STIR AMONG THE GENERAL PUBLIC.

35
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:13,916
THE MEDIA MADE SUCH
A BIG DEAL OUT OF IT

36
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,916
I FELT THE WHOLE THING HAD BEEN
A DREAM NOW THAT IT WAS OVER.

37
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,583
AYEKA WAS VERY GENEROUS

38
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:25,583
AND DECIDED NOT TO PUNISH ANYONE
INVOLVED IN THE INCIDENT,

39
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:28,583
BUT MANY OF THOSE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE CONSPIRACY

40
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,958
LEFT THEIR JOBS
OF THEIR OWN ACCORD.

41
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:40,333
AND AS FOR MY GRANDPA...

42
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:43,750
- ( laughing )
COME ON, EVERYONE.

43
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:46,625
DID YOU THINK I WAS
GOING TO DIE THAT EASILY?

44
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:49,125
YOU KNOW ME BETTER
THAN THAT, DON'T YOU?

45
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:50,625
- HERE'S A HOT TOWEL FOR YOU.

46
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:53,000
- OH, GREAT.  THANK YOU.

47
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:56,625
- NEEDLESS TO SAY,

48
00:03:56,708 --> 00:04:00,291
GRANDPA AND DAD
COULDN'T BE HAPPIER.

49
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:07,958
- THEY'RE READY TO GO.

50
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:11,333
- OKAY, THEN.
I'M TRANSMITTING ENERGY NOW.

51
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:21,833
- ( yawns )

52
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:24,666
HELLO, EVERYONE.

53
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,708
GOOD MORNING!
- GOOD MORNING!

54
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:28,666
- THE GUARDIANS,
AZAKA AND KAMIDAKE,

55
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,416
WERE BROUGHT BACK
TO LIFE SAFELY.

56
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,125
AND THE TWO KNIGHTS,

57
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:35,666
THAT IS THE ORIGINAL
AZAKA AND KAMIDAKE,

58
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,583
ARE ENJOYING THEIR LIVES
AS HUMANS AGAIN.

59
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:43,958
- NOT SO FAST.
- TAKE THAT!  TAKE THAT

60
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:45,333
AND THAT!
- I'VE GOT YOU NOW!

61
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:49,333
THERE!
- OOPS.  OH, NO!

62
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:51,666
-Tenchi: AZAKA'S COMPLETELY
HOOKED ON THAT VIDEO GAME

63
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,166
SO HE LOOKS UP TO SASAMI
AS HIS MASTER

64
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,875
AND IS NOW SERVING
AS HER APPRENTICE.

65
00:04:56,958 --> 00:05:00,583
- NOW THIS TIME I'LL WIN,
SO LET US PLAY!

66
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:09,833
- GUESS WHAT.  WASHU WAS ELECTED
AS HONORARY PRESIDENT

67
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:13,375
OF THE UNIVERSAL
SCIENCE ACADEMY.

68
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:15,208
- ( applause )

69
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,916
- ( loud crackling )

70
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,875
- THANKS.  ALTHOUGH I THINK
IT'S QUITE NATURAL

71
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:36,208
FOR ME TO BE APPOINTED HONORARY
PRESIDENT OF THE SCIENCE ACADEMY

72
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:38,208
I STILL FEEL VERY MOVED,

73
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:41,208
MOVED TO THE POINT
OF TEARS, ALMOST.

74
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:44,250
WHAT I SAY NEXT COMES
FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART.

75
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:46,250
I HEREBY PLEDGE THAT
MY SCIENTIFIC SKILLS

76
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,958
WILL BE EMPLOYED ONLY
IN THE PURSUIT OF PEACE!

77
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:50,333
- ( applause )

78
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,583
- ( laughing )

79
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:02,083
- GUESS WHAT AGAIN.
A MONTH LATER, IT WAS DISCOVERED

80
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,250
THAT WASHU WAS DEVELOPING
A WEAPON

81
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:05,250
THAT WOULD DESTROY
THE UNIVERSE

82
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:08,083
AND SHE WAS KICKED OUT
OF THE ACADEMY.

83
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:10,208
BET YOU HAD A HARD TIME
GUESSING THAT.

84
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:16,166
MIHOSHI AND KIYONE RETURNED

85
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,916
TO THE GALAXY POLICE.

86
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:22,916
KIYONE, WHO HAD HAD
MORE THAN HER SHARE

87
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,166
OF BAD LUCK IN LIFE,
WAS FINALLY HAPPY.

88
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:32,916
SHE GOT A PROMOTION TO THE
POSITION OF DETECTIVE SERGEANT.

89
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,791
- SARGE,
I BROUGHT YOU SOME TEA.

90
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:39,166
- AH, THANKS.

91
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:42,958
( spits )

92
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:44,875
WHAT IS THIS STUFF?!

93
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:48,416
MAKING A DECENT CUP OF TEA CAN'T
BE THAT DIFFICULT, CAN IT?

94
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:51,875
- YOU KNOW WHO MADE GREAT
TEA?

95
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:54,166
SASAMI MADE GREAT TEA,
THAT'S WHO.

96
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,208
- ( groans )
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

97
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,458
I'LL MAKE IT
BETTER NEXT TIME.

98
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:00,125
( growls )

99
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:01,291
- HMM?

100
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,708
( laughing )

101
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:10,583
- FRANKLY, MIHOSHI SEEMS TO BE
AVOIDING HER RESPONSIBILITIES

102
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:12,541
AS A CHIEF CRIMINAL
PREVENTION OFFICER.

103
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:14,666
SHE'S ALWAYS HANGING
AROUND WITH KIYONE,

104
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,833
BUT THEY SEEM
TO BE DOING FINE.

105
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:19,666
WHO I CANNOT TELL
YOU ABOUT IS RYOKO.

106
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,000
HER WHEREABOUTS
ARE STILL UNKNOWN.

107
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:36,708
- HEY.
- WHAT CAN I GET YOU?

108
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:40,291
- HAVE YOU SEEN
THIS WOMAN AROUND?

109
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:45,625
- I'M SORRY.  NO.
IS SHE A FRIEND OF YOURS?

110
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:47,291
- WHAT?!
- HUH?

111
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:52,500
A FRIEND OF MINE?
OF COURSE NOT.

112
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:03,958
- WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?
- HUH?

113
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:06,083
JUST THE SCENERY OF JURAI.

114
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:11,458
IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

115
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,458
- WHICH PLACE IS
MORE BEAUTIFUL TO YOU,

116
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:17,250
THE EARTH OR JURAI?

117
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:18,958
- BOTH PLACES ARE BEAUTIFUL.

118
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:22,208
THIS PLANET HAS SOME THINGS
THE EARTH DOESN'T HAVE

119
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:24,791
AND THE EARTH HAS SOME THINGS
THAT JURAI DOESN'T HAVE.

120
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:27,458
- I SUPPOSE YOU'RE RIGHT.

121
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:31,916
- SO LOVELY. 
SO WONDERFUL.

122
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:35,208
- OH.

123
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:37,500
ARE YOU REALLY LEAVING?

124
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,125
- MM-HMM.

125
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,416
SASAMI?

126
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:48,375
- ( sobbing )
WE'LL MEET AGAIN,

127
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:49,958
WON'T WE, TENCHI?

128
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:52,958
- OF COURSE.
- TENCHI.

129
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,333
- THE PRINCESS AYEKA WOULD
LIKE TO SEE YOU, TENCHI.

130
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,833
- WELL, MY VACATION
IS OVER NOW, TENCHI.

131
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:24,583
THIS TIME, I'M AFRAID,
IT'S OVER FOR GOOD.

132
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:30,500
YOUR DECISION TO LEAVE 
IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE,

133
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,791
IS IT, TENCHI?
- NO.

134
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,958
- YOU COULD HAVE EVERYTHING
YOU EVER WANTED

135
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,458
IF YOU ACCEPTED
THE THRONE, YOU KNOW?

136
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:39,666
- DO YOU REALLY
THINK SO, AYEKA?

137
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:44,208
MAYBE IF I HAD BEEN RAISED
BY JURAI'S ROYAL FAMILY

138
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:46,500
FROM THE START, AYEKA,
BUT THEN I WOULDN'T HAVE ALL

139
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:48,958
THOSE WONDERFUL MEMORIES
WITH YOU AND EVERYONE ELSE.

140
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:50,291
ALL THOSE EXPERIENCES

141
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:53,166
ARE NOT ALLOWED
JURAI'S EMPEROR.

142
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,500
- PROBABLY NOT.

143
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,166
- I'M SORRY,

144
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,958
BUT I GUESS I'M SUPPOSED
TO LIVE AN ORDINARY LIFE

145
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,500
WITHOUT MUCH RESPONSIBILITY.

146
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:04,041
I THINK I'M LIKE 
GRANDPA THAT WAY.

147
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:08,666
- AND I AM SUPPOSED
TO LIVE MY LIFE

148
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,500
AS THE CROWN PRINCESS
AS I HAVE ALL ALONG.

149
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:14,875
- HUH?
- AND I'M PROUD I HAVE

150
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:18,625
BECAUSE THIS IS THE ONLY
LIFE I KNOW, TENCHI.

151
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:23,375
- I UNDERSTAND, AYEKA.

152
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:30,500
- I REALLY WANT
TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

153
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:34,333
I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR A REALLY
WONDERFUL VACATION, TENCHI.

154
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:51,666
- I WILL NOT SEE YOU OFF
WHEN YOU LEAVE, TENCHI,

155
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,958
BUT I SINCERELY HOPE YOUR
JOURNEY BACK TO THE EARTH

156
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:55,708
WILL BE A SAFE ONE.

157
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:08,583
- AND THAT WAS
THE LAST TIME I SAW AYEKA.

158
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,166
SO I'M BACK ON EARTH AGAIN.

159
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:34,500
RYU-OH'S TREE
HAS GROWN SO TALL.

160
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,166
- IT'S SPRING NOW.
I'M BACK IN SCHOOL AGAIN,

161
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,541
AND THE DAYS I SPENT
IN SPACE WERE REGARDED

162
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:48,000
AS AN EXCUSED ABSENCE.

163
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,708
( horn honks )

164
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:07,041
EVERYTHING IS JUST LIKE BEFORE.
CALM AND PEACEFUL.

165
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,250
JUST ORDINARY, EVERYDAY LIFE.

166
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:10,875
NO PROBLEMS.

167
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:14,000
- ( clanking ) 

168
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,666
- GRANDPA HASN'T
CHANGED A BIT.

169
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:23,833
- HELLO.

170
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:26,541
- ( yawns )

171
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,875
- WHO WOULD EVER IMAGINE
THAT A SHINTO PRIEST

172
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:32,708
IN A SMALL TOWN COULD HAVE BEEN
THE RULER OF THE UNIVERSE?

173
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:40,125
- DAD'S STILL DILIGENTLY
GOING TO THE OFFICE

174
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:42,833
COMPLAINING ABOUT
THE LONG COMMUTE.

175
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:45,583
- HERE YOU GO.
- OH.

176
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:50,875
- ( both scream )
- HE HASN'T CHANGED, EITHER.

177
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:56,541
WE STILL HAVE THE KARAOKE SET
WE BOUGHT IN SPACE.

178
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,750
WE'VE NEVER USED IT
SINCE WE CAME BACK TO EARTH.

179
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:01,875
IT JUST SITS THERE IN THE CORNER
OF THE ROOM COLLECTING DUST.

180
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:04,708
IT SURE BRINGS BACK
THE MEMORIES, THOUGH.

181
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:07,333
LIKE I SAID,
CALM AND PEACEFUL.

182
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,916
- HURRY UP, MIHOSHI,

183
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,166
OR WE'RE GONNA BE LATE
FOR WORK AGAIN!

184
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:40,041
- OH, KIYONE,
WAIT FOR ME, PLEASE!

185
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:42,000
- I'LL BE THERE IN A MINUTE.

186
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:44,291
MIHOSHI, YOU ALWAYS
MAKE US LATE!

190
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:16,458

WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A BATH?

191
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,333
- THANK YOU.  I'M COMING.

192
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:46,916
JUST AN ORDINARY
BATHROOM NOW.

193
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,375
NOTHING SPECIAL.
NOTHING SPECIAL AT ALL.

194
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:04,208
- I'M OFF TO SCHOOL NOW.
GOODBYE.

195
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:37,000
- TENCHI, WE ARE
HAVING FUN, AREN'T WE?

196
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:40,375
EVERY DAY HERE
IS LIKE A DREAM.

197
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:43,958
I HOPE IT'S GOING TO BE
