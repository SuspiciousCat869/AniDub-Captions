I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS.

LONG DISTANCE COMMUTING IS FINE,

85
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:02,958

OH, OKAY, PLEASE,
LISTEN TO ME.

I-- I DON'T HAVE
A CLUE WHAT YOUR PROBLEM IS,

93
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,875
BUT I'M SURE WE CAN WORK IT OUT
PEACEFULLY, YOU KNOW?

94
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:29,541
TALK THINGS OUT.
CAN'T WE ALL JUST GET ALONG?

95
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:31,625
- NO, HE'S A SAVAGE CRIMINAL,

96
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:33,958
AND IT'S NO USE
TRYING TO TALK WITH HIM.

97
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:35,458
- YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING.

98
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:38,625
- THIS IS OUR DESTINY,
AND WE TOO MUST SHARE IT.

99
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:40,791
WE PROMISED TO DIE TOGETHER,
REMEMBER?

100
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:43,458
- I DON'T REMEMBER
MAKING YOU THAT PROMISE.

101
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:45,458
- WE'LL BE STARS
IN THE SKY TOGETHER.

102
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:46,833
- NO!

103
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:49,041
I'M TOO YOUNG TO DIE.

104
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,916
- Both: HUH?
- ( machine trilling )

105
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:05,250
- HE SEEMS UNABLE
TO GET UP, HUH?

106
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:06,333
- HE SURE DOES.

107
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:14,250

- ( chopping )

112
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:33,916
- NOBUYUKI.
- UH, WHAT IS IT, FATHER?

113
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,375
- WHERE IS TENCHI?

114
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:37,583
HE'S VERY LATE COMING HOME
TODAY, ISN'T HE?

115
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:40,583
- WELL THEN, HE MUST BE BUSY
PICKING UP GIRLS.

116
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:43,083
- NO.  HE DOESN'T TAKE
AFTER YOU.

117
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,666
- ( laughs )

118
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,791
YOU'RE BEING A LITTLE TOUGH
ON ME, AREN'T YOU, FATHER?

119
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:51,291
- ALTHOUGH, IT'S TRUE,
HE'S BEEN A BIT LAZY THESE DAYS.

120
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:53,875
MAYBE I SHOULD SCOLD HIM
WHEN HE GETS IN.

121
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:55,125
- ( gate opens )

122
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,291
- OH, THAT MUST BE HIM NOW.

123
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:59,916
- ( panting )

124
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,583
- TENCHI, IT'S VERY
LATE AT NIGHT.

125
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:02,791
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

126
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:05,625
ARE YOU BECOMING
A JUVENILE DELINQUENT ON ME?

127
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:06,708
HUH?

128
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:08,125
- ( giggles )

129
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:10,375
HI.

130
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:12,333
- WHOA...

131
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:16,250
AND WHO IS THIS
BEAUTIFUL YOUNG LADY?

132
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,375
- ( choking )

133
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:22,083
- WHY ARE YOU SO UPSET?
WHAT DID YOU TWO DO?

134
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:24,833
ELOPE OR SOMETHING?
- OH, HOW DID YOU GUESS THAT?

135
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:27,416
- NO, I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING!

136
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,750
- WELL THEN, WHAT IS THIS
ALL ABOUT?

137
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:32,375
OUTER SPACE?

138
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:35,541
- YES, AND I WAS ATTACKED
BY A SAVAGE PIRATE

139
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:37,250
ON MY JOURNEY
THROUGH OUTER SPACE.

140
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:39,583
I DESPERATELY TRIED TO ESCAPE,

141
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:42,416
BUT MY SPACESHIP
ALMOST RAN INTO ANOTHER SHIP,

142
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,250
AND FELL STRAIGHT DOWN
TO THIS PLANET.

143
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:48,208
- YOU DON'T EXPECT NORMAL PEOPLE
LIKE US TO BELIEVE THAT STORY.

144
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:50,750
- OHH...
- ( gasps )

145
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:53,208
- YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGH
A VERY GREAT HARDSHIP,

146
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:55,250
YOUNG LADY FROM OUTER SPACE.

147
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:57,208
OH, SUCH DISTRESS.

148
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:59,125
- HUH?

149
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,875
- TENCHI, JUST DON'T SIT THERE.

150
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:03,125
WHY DON'T YOU OFFER
SOME NICE CANDY OR SOMETHING?

151
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,791
- WAIT A MINUTE!

152
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:07,625
YOU DON'T MEAN TO TELL ME YOU
BELIEVE HER RIDICULOUS STORY?

153
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:11,333
- I FIND HER STORY MUCH MORE
BELIEVABLE THAN THE STORY OF YOU

154
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:12,958
PICKING UP SUCH A PRETTY GIRL.

155
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:14,458
- OH, I SEE.

156
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:18,000
- MUST BE VERY COLD IN OUTER
SPACE THIS TIME OF YEAR.

157
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:20,666
HERE, HAVE SOME MORE HOT TEA,
WON'T YOU?

158
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:25,666
- OH, HOW SWEET OF YOU TO TALK
SO KINDLY TO A TOTAL STRANGER.

159
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,500
BUT IF A STAY HERE, IT WILL
ONLY MEAN TROUBLE FOR YOU,

160
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,625
AND I DON'T WANNA CAUSE YOU
ANY TROUBLE.

161
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:34,625
AND SHE, THAT SPACE PIRATE,
WILL COME BACK FOR ME, I'M SURE.

162
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:37,166
- AH, REST ASSURED,
YOUNG LADY,

163
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,083
WE ARE ON YOUR SIDE.

164
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:40,583
- BUT, UH--

165
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:41,916
- DON'T YOU WORRY
ABOUT ANYTHING.

166
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,916
WE'LL PROTECT YOU,
I PROMISE.

167
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,875
- I THANK YOU,
HONORABLE FATHER!

168
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:49,375
- OH, CAN I BELIEVE MY EARS?
YOU CALLED ME FATHER!

169
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:51,458
- YES.  I'LL BE YOUR
DEVOTED DAUGHTER.

170
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:52,833
- ( crying )

171
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:55,333
TENCHI, YOU GOT
A WONDERFUL BRIDE.

172
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:56,791
- WHAT?

173
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,291
- AND I KNOW YOUR
MOTHER IN HEAVEN

174
00:09:58,375 --> 00:09:59,958
MUST BE HAPPY FOR YOU NOW.

175
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:02,500
- ( groans )
- MY, FATHER...

176
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:04,416
- MY DAUGHTER...

177
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:10,375
- MM... MM.

178
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:12,750
- UGH... AAH.

179
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,875
- ( trilling )

180
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,708
- YOU!

181
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:33,416
YOU!

182
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:46,958
- REALLY, THIS MAY WORK
AGAINST TYPHOONS,

183
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:49,458
BUT NOT AGAINST SPACE PIRATES.

184
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:51,208
WE'RE WASTING OUR TIME.

185
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:52,916
- STOP GRUMBLING
AND REMEMBER,

186
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,958
ALWAYS PUT OFF TILL TOMORROW
WHAT YOU CAN DO TODAY.

187
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,541
OH, WAIT A MINUTE.
THAT DIDN'T COME OUT RIGHT.

188
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:57,958
- AH.

189
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:00,208
- WELL, I THINK I'LL BE GOING
BACK TO THE SHRINE NOW.

190
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:03,166
YOU COME CALL ME
IF ANYTHING HAPPENS.

191
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,500
- OKAY, GOOD NIGHT, GRANDPA.

192

NO!  NO NO NO NO NO NO NO.

204
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:43,291
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
- TO ANOTHER ROOM.

205
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:44,666
- WHY IS THAT?

206
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,958
- BECAUSE I CAN'T DO MY HOMEWORK
WITH ALL THIS NOISE.

207
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,416
- OHH, YOU'RE NOT ABANDONING ME,
ARE YOU?

208
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,416
- HEY, LET ME GO!
- DON'T GO, PLEASE.

209
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,083
YOU CAN'T LEAVE ME HERE
ALL ALONE.

210
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:56,541
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

211
00:11:56,625 --> 00:12:00,166
- WELL, YOU SEE, MY TENCHI...
- ( groans )

212
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,166
AH, LET ME GO, WILL YOU?!

213
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,000

- Both: HUH?

214
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:10,333

( gasps )

215
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:11,500
OHH...

( chuckles nervously )

217
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,916
RYOKO, IT'S FOR YOU!

218
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
- OH, I WAS JUST ABOUT
TO WIN THE GAME.

219
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,875
WHO IS IT THAT COULD BE
VISITING US SO LATE AT NIGHT?

220
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,125
- YOU FOOL,
IT'S THE SPACE PIRATE!

221
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:29,458
- OHH, THAT'S RIGHT.
SPACE PIRATE.

222
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:32,208
- YEAH!  SPACE PIRATE!

- NO, WE'RE GOING THIS WAY.
- WHERE?  WHICH WAY?

- ALL RIGHT,
WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?

231
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,166
HMM.

232
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,666
- GRANDPA!

233
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:35,208
OHH...

234
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,041
HUH?

235
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:43,041
- WHAT A NUISANCE.

236
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:49,750
- GRANDPA...

237
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,750
- JUST LEAVE IT TO ME.

238
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:05,541
( yells )

239
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,750
- HURRAY!

240
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:17,375
- YOU'RE THE GREATEST, GRANDPA.

241
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:20,958
- ( coughing )

242
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:24,333
- HUH?

243
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:29,500
- SURRENDER YOURSELF,
SPACE PIRATE RYOKO!

244
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:31,833
YOUR EVIL DEEDS
END HERE AND NOW.

245
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:34,291
- HEY, NOW WAIT JUST A MINUTE.

246
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:37,083
I THOUGHT YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO BE THE SPACE PIRATE.

247
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:40,583
- I AM FIRST CLASS DETECTIVE
MIHOSHI FROM GALAXY POLICE.

248
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:43,625
I'VE COME HERE IN PURSUIT OF
THE INFAMOUS CRIMINAL RYOKO,

249
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:45,583
WANTED THROUGHOUT
THE UNIVERSE.

250
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:49,250
- SHE'S LYING. DO I LOOK LIKE
AN INFAMOUS CRIMINAL?

251
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:50,833
- MM...
- OH!

252
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:53,291
HOW COULD YOU SUSPECT ME
WHEN THERE'S NO PROOF?

253
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:57,291
- OH, THERE'S PROOF, ALL RIGHT.
I HAVE IT RIGHT HERE.

254
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,500
OH, NO, I-- I DON'T.

255
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,500
OH, OKAY.
HERE IT IS.

256
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:03,875
NO NO, HERE HERE.
NO, HERE?

257
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:06,291
NO.  THIS IS DEFINITELY
NOT THE PROOF.

258
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:08,750
I-- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THIS IS.

259
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:11,708
NOW THIS IS STRANGE.
WHERE DID I PUT IT?

260
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:13,833
AH, I FOUND IT.

261
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,666
( grunts )
HERE-- HERE IT IS.

262
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,333
THIS IS MY PROOF.
HERE IS MY I.D.

263
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,166
AND SEE?
HERE'S THE "WANTED" POSTER.

264
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,541
- AAH!

265
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:33,500
- ( evil laughter )

266
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:35,833
OKAY, SO YOU KNOW
WHO I REALLY AM NOW.

267
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:38,000
I HAD A HANGOVER
WHEN I RAN INTO YOU.

268
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:41,000
OTHERWISE, A STUPID COP LIKE YOU
NEVER WOULD HAVE SPOTTED ME.

269
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:42,958
I DON'T USUALLY
MAKE MISTAKES LIKE THAT.

270
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:45,375
NOW WHY?
BECAUSE I'M SMART.

271
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:50,041
SO, STUPID, HOW DO YOU THINK
I SHOULD COOK YOU?

272
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:54,208
- DON'T MOVE, PLEASE.
STOP RIGHT THERE.

273
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:56,000
IF YOU MOVE,
I-- I'M GONNA SHOOT.

274
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:57,833
IF I SHOOT,
IT'S GONNA REALLY HURT YOU.

275
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,583
- ( laughs )

276
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,291
GO RIGHT AHEAD.

277
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:03,041
- ( whimpers )

278
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:05,041
( grunts )

279
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,750
- THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU'RE HUNTING BIG GAME NOW.

280
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:21,250
TOO BIG FOR YOU.

281
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:24,708
NOW I'VE HAD ENOUGH,
AND IT'S MY TURN TO RETALIATE.

282
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:26,708
- ( whimpers )

283
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:29,291
- AAH!

284

- ( screaming )

285
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,750
- YOU CAN'T ESCAPE ME.

286
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:38,500

TO BE A NOISY EVENING.

- BACK UP OR SOMETHING,
COME ON!

290
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:52,083
CAN'T YOU DO ANYTHING
ABOUT THIS?

291
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:54,083
YOU'RE A COP,
AREN'T YOU?

292
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:57,041
- WELL YES I AM, BUT--

295
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:02,125
- WELL, YOU'RE A GREAT HELP.
( grumbles )

296
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:10,583
NOW HURRY.

297
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:15,083
- WAIT.  I CAN'T STAND UP.

298
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:17,041
- ( grunts )
- OH!  ( gasps )

299
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:20,000
- WELL, NOW YOU DIE.

300
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:21,958
- OH, YEAH?
I-- OH...

301
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:27,250
COME ON!  I'M READY!

302
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:28,958
- ( gasps )

303
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,583
( exhales )
THAT WAS FUN.

304
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:58,958
- HUH?

305
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:00,875
- I WAS NEVER REALLY
GONNA HURT YOU GUYS.

306
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:02,708
I WAS JUST TEASING.
COULDN'T YOU TELL?

JUST HAVING SOME FUN.

308
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,791
- SO, YOU'RE GONNA 
SURRENDER YOURSELF?

309
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:09,625
- WELL, I JUST MIGHT
DO THAT FOR YOU.

310

I THINK I'LL DO YOU A FAVOR
AND STAY HERE FOR AWHILE.

333
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:06,291
- YOU'LL DO WHAT?!

334
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:08,708
- ( chuckles )
YOU'RE HAPPY, AREN'T YOU?

335
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:10,125
- EH, ECSTATIC.

336
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:13,958
- YOU WERE SO WONDERFUL
WHEN YOU FIRST SAVED ME.

337
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:15,625
SO VALIANT AND BRAVE.

338
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:17,541
- EH?

339
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:19,500
- ( giggles )

340
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:33,625
OH, I HAD SO MUCH FUN
LAST NIGHT.

341
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:37,125
- WELL, ISN'T THAT JUST
SO NICE FOR YOU.  NOT ME.

342
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:41,083
- I'M IN LOVE.
I LOVE THESE PICKLES.

343
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:43,416
- MY DECEASED WIFE'S
SPECIAL RECIPE.

344
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,750
GO AHEAD, HAVE SOME MORE.

345
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:48,041
- WOW, THANKS SO MUCH.

346
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:50,708
- HEY, HOW COME YOU'RE EATING
BREAKFAST WITH US ANYWAY?

347
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:55,208
YOU'VE GOT SOME NERVE.
- DOESN'T THAT APPLY TO YOU TOO?

348
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:57,208
- HMM.
- ( sniffles )

349
00:19:57,291 --> 00:20:00,041
I'M SORRY, MY SPACESHIP
WAS DESTROYED.

350
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:03,333
AND I HAVE NO WAY TO GET HOME
AND NO PLACE TO CALL HOME.

351
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:08,750
- NOW NOW, PLEASE DON'T CRY.
I--

352
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,375
- IT'S TOO BAD.

353
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:13,666
ESPECIALLY NOW THAT I DECIDED
TO SURRENDER MYSELF TO YOU.

354
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,541
- ( sobs )

355
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:18,458
GALAXY POLICE FEDERAL LAW
SAYS THAT...

356
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:21,416
I CAN'T REMEMBER.
( crying )

357
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:26,583
- SO-- SO WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO NOW?

358
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:28,875
- I REALLY DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

359
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:31,375
UH, WOULD LET ME STAY HERE
FOR AWHILE?

360
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:34,333
I DON'T KNOW ANYONE ELSE
ON THIS PLANET.

361
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,333
- MM, THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

362
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:37,750
- SURE IS.

363
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,666
IT'LL BRIGHTEN OUR LIVES HAVING
YOU GIRLS IN THIS HOUSE

364
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,791
FULL OF BACHELORS.
( laughs )

365
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,500
- IF YOU WOULD BE SO KIND,

366
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:46,875
I HAVE ANOTHER FAVOR
TO ASK OF YOU.

367
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:49,375
- HMM?  YES, WHAT IS IT?

368
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:52,458
- MAY I HAVE SOME MORE
 STEAMED RICE, PLEASE?

369
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:08,541
- SO HERE YOU ARE, TENCHI.

370
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:11,791
- WHO DO THINK IS RESPONSIBLE
FOR ALL THIS?

371
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:13,625
- SUCH A TRIVIAL QUESTION.

372
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:16,916
- HONESTLY, ARE YOU REALLY
GONNA STAY HERE TO LIVE WITH US?

373
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,416
- OH, SURE,
IF IT MAKES YOU HAPPY.

YET ANOTHER GIRL ARRIVES

401

FROM OUTER SPACE
WITH THE GRANDEST FLAIR.

402
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:34,916
SHE IS A REAL PRINCESS
KNOWN THROUGHOUT THE UNIVERSE.

403
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,750
THE PROBLEM IS RYOKO, WHO SEEMS
TO HAVE SOMETHING AGAINST HER...

404
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,416
