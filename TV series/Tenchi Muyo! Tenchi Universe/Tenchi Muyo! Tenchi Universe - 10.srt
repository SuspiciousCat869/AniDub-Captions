- RYOKO, HUH?

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,333
WE HAVEN'T HEARD MUCH
ABOUT HER LATELY, HAVE WE?

- LIKE YOU DIDN'T KNOW?

33
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:18,500
I HEARD SHE SETTLED DOWN
ON PLANET EARTH.

00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:21,000
- EARTH?
WHERE THE HELL IS THAT?

35
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:22,791
- I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY,

36
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:26,458
BUT THEY SAY IT'S OUT
IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.

37
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:29,375

39

A "MOST WANTED" RE-UNION.

- HUH?

- THERE'S NO NEED
FOR YOU TO WORRY.

50
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:04,958
I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN YOU AT ALL.

51
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:07,166
- IT-- IT CAN'T BE.

00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,208
YOU CAN'T BE.

53
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,416

54
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,083
TELL ME MORE ABOUT RYOKO.

THAT'S A LOT OF CARROTS.

60
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:36,250
HUH?

61
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:37,375
AH-HA.

62
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:38,958
IS THAT YOU, RYO-OHKI?

63
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:41,250
CALM DOWN.
THESE CARROTS ARE ALL FOR YOU.

64
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:44,666
RYO-OHKI?

HUH? AAH!

69
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:07,125
RYOKO!

70
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:09,791
ALL RIGHT,
NOW WHERE IS RYOKO?

71
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,458
- WELL...

72
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:13,416
- ( grunts )
NOW TELL ME THE TRUTH.

73
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,083
YOU'LL REGRET IT IF YOU
TRY TO HIDE THINGS FROM ME.

( gulps )

76
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:24,666
SORRY, UM, EVERYBODY TOLD ME
TO STAY FOR SNACKS,

77
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,791
SO I WASN'T EATING
YOUR SHARE OR ANYTHING.

78
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:29,125
AT LEAST,
I HOPE I WASN'T.

79
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:31,333
- THIS ISN'T ABOUT SNACKS,
TWIT.

80
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:33,583
- SHE JUST GOT HERE.
SHE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING.

81
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:34,791
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

82
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,375
- I CANNOT FIND TENCHI.

83
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:37,541
- WHAT?

84
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:39,833
BUT I THOUGHT YOU WERE
LOOKING FOR RYOKO.

85
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:41,250
- OW!
- WHAT I AM SAYING

86
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,333
IS THAT RYOKO MUST HAVE
TAKEN TENCHI WITH HER

87
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,583
TO SOME PRIVATE PLACE,

88
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:46,708
AND NONE OF YOU SEEM
TO CARE AT ALL.

89
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,166
RYOKO!
WHERE DID YOU GO?

90
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,583
YOU CANNOT HIDE FROM ME!

91
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,375
- SO THIS IS WHAT YOU
HAVE TO DEAL WITH, SASAMI?

92
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:56,166
- ( giggles )
- RYOKO, HURRY UP!

93
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,333
- YOU KNOW, SHE'S GETTING
WORSE AND WORSE THESE DAYS,

94
00:04:58,416 --> 00:04:59,458
DON'T YOU THINK?

95
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,916

- THERE'S SOMETHING UP THERE.

102
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:15,875
- OH NO, YOU THINK
IT COULD BE A RAT?

103
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:18,875
- A RAT CAN'T BE THAT BIG,
MIHOSHI.

104
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:20,416
- IS IT A CAT?

105
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,416
HUH?!

110
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,625
- WELL, HOW DID HE
GET IN HERE?

- HEY, RYO-OHKI!

117
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:47,708
YOU SHOULDN'T BE SO HOSTILE.

118

- ( meows )

119
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,791

OR I WON'T GIVE YOU

120
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:53,000
ANYMORE CARROTS.

121
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:56,000

123

NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.

138

( chewing )

142

143
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,041

- ( chuckles )
HE'S SO SWEET, ISN'T HE?

148
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:01,375
- HE MUST HAVE BEEN
BROUGHT UP REALLY WELL.

149
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:03,583
- YOU MUST BE HAPPY,
RYO-OHKI.

- ( meows )

151

THAT WAS A NICE BATH.

152
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:09,875
TAKING A BATH IN THE DAYTIME
FEELS SO GOOD.

153
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:14,291
IT'S-- IT'S KENOKI!

154
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:15,958
- KENOKI?

155
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:17,833
- DO YOU KNOW HIM, RYOKO?
HUH.

156
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:20,208
- KENOKI?
SO THAT'S HIS NAME, IS IT?

157
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:23,250
- NO WAY. SHE CAN'T BE
HERE ON THE EARTH.

158
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:24,625
- HMM.
- HUH?

162
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,291
- ( meowing )

163
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:44,041
- CAN SOMEBODY TELL ME WHAT
IN THE WORLD IS GOING ON?

164
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:49,708
- ( all panting )

165
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:51,375
- WHAT IS HAPPENING,
RYOKO?

166
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:53,000
RYOKO?

167
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:58,916
HMM?

168
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:06,708
SO IT'S JUST AS I THOUGHT.

169
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:14,583
- LONG TIME NO SEE,
RYOKO.

170
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:21,666
- I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D TRAVEL
THIS FAR A DISTANCE AFTER ME.

171
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,916
- HMM. THAT'S WHAT
I DO FOR A LIVING.

172
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,041
I AM A BOUNTY HUNTER.

173
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:29,541
I TOLD YOU ONCE ALREADY 
THAT I'D TAKE YOUR HEAD.

174
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:31,083
- NAGI!

175
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:34,333
YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU ARE A BOUNTY HUNTER.

176
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:35,958
THIS IS MY JURISDICTION,

177
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:38,666
AND BOUNTY HUNTERS MUST
STAY OUT OF THIS AREA. 

178
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,083
- ARE YOU KIYONE?

179
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:42,625
- HMM.
YOU'VE HEARD OF ME.

180
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:45,166
- THEY SAY YOU'RE THE BEST
AMONG THE YOUNGER GENERATION

181
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,958
OF THE GALAXY POLICE.

182
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:48,750
- All: OHH!

183
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:52,083
- BUT NOW YOU'RE ASSIGNED TO
A STATION IN THIS REMOTE REGION,

184
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:55,791
THE RUMOR HAS IT THAT YOU'RE
DOWN ON YOUR LUCK.

185
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,375
- ( growls )

186
00:08:57,458 --> 00:09:00,833
THAT'S NOT MY FAULT!

187
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,583
IT'S BECAUSE OF 
MY PARTNER HERE.

188
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,500
- HMM.
THAT'S A BIT LOW,

189
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:07,458
BLAMING OTHERS FOR
YOUR PROBLEMS.

190
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,708
- HEY, YOU.
YOU LISTEN TO ME NOW.

191
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,750
KIYONE IS NOT A LOSER,
ALL RIGHT?

192
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:15,291
SHE'S GETTING 200 MORE YEN
PER HOUR THAN ME,

193
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:17,125
I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW.

194
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:18,291
- ( grunting )

195
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,000
WILL YOU KEEP YOUR 
MOUTH SHUT, PLEASE?

196
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:21,458
- RYOKO,

197
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:23,958
I'VE TAKEN YOUR MAN
AS A HOSTAGE.

198
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:24,958
- YOU MEAN TENCHI?

199
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:27,291
- IF YOU WANT YOUR MAN BACK,

200
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:29,125
COME TO VENUS.

201
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:30,791
WE'LL SETTLE THE MATTER THERE.

202
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:32,000
- HEY, YOU!

203
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:34,125
TENCHI IS NOT RYOKO'S MAN.

204
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,083
I THINK YOU SHOULD
PLEASE UNDERSTAND

205
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,375
THE SITUATION CORRECTLY.

206
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:38,666
- KENOKI!

207
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,166
- ( howls )
- HUH?

208
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:44,250
- ( growls )

209
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,041
- I'LL BE WAITING FOR YOU,
RYOKO.

210
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,458
- HEY, COME BACK.

211
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:03,500
- ( laughs )

212
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,375
- ( meows )

213
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,333
- ( murmurs )

214
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:12,958
- YO!

215
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,250
- RYOKO!

216
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,208
- ( gasps )

217
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:42,708
- I'VE TOLD YOU THAT I WOULD
GET THE REWARD FOR YOU.

218
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:44,416
I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU GO.

219
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,416
NOT YOU. NEVER.

220
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,208
( chuckles )

221
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:51,041
WE ARE HAVING SOME FUN,
HUH?

222
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:52,375
AREN'T WE?

223
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,875
- NOW, RYOKO!

224
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:00,416
I NEED SOME EXPLANATION HERE.

225
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,750
I CANNOT STAND IT.

226
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:03,166
TENCHI IS YOUR MAN?

227
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,291
THAT IS NOT THE TRUE
STORY AT ALL, IS IT?

228
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:08,375
- AYEKA, THAT'S NOT WHAT
WE SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT.

229
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:13,375
- YEAH. WHO OR WHAT IS
THIS NAGI PERSON ANYWAY, HUH?

230
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:14,875
( sighs )

231
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:16,916
KIYONE?

232
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,875
- SHE'S A PROFESSIONAL
BOUNTY HUNTER.

233
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:22,708
SHE'S A LONE WOLF WHO GOES
AFTER WANTED CRIMINALS

234
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:23,708
FOR THE REWARD, AND
SHE'S THE VERY BEST

235
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:26,791
IN THE UNIVERSE AT WHAT
SHE DOES.

236
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:28,916
- AND SHE'S AFTER RYOKO!

237
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,458
OH NO.
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

238
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:33,208
- NAGI?

239
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:35,000
SHE AND I GO WAY BACK.

240
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:37,416
SORT OF LIKE
ARCH-RIVALS.

241
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:46,125
THE WANTED AND THE HUNTER.

242
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:49,791
WE HAVE FACED EACH OTHER
MANY TIMES IN THE PAST. 

243
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:55,166
( shouts, grunts )

244
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:57,916
- AAH.

245
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:01,166
- ( grunts )

246
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:04,125
- ( laughs ) YOU CAN'T
GET AWAY FROM ME, RYOKO.

247
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:05,250
( laughs )

248
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:06,208
- ( shouts )

249
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:16,125
- OF ALL THOSE
HUNTED DOWN BY HER,

250
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:19,833
NOBODY HAS EVER SURVIVED.

251
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:21,166
EXCEPT FOR ME.

252
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,958
BUT THIS TIME, 
I DON'T KNOW...

253
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:33,750
WHAT WILL HAPPEN.

254
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,666
- ( strains )

255
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,375
( grunts )

256
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:56,333
- HMM.
THIS GUY IS RYOKO'S?

257
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,500
- HUH?

258
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,541
- WE'RE ALMOST TO VENUS.

259
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:10,833
THERE SHE IS.

260
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,833
THIS IS JUST BETWEEN
ME AND HER, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

261
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:16,625
YOU HAVE GOT TO STAY
OUT OF THIS, KIYONE.

262
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,416
- I CAN'T DO THAT.

263
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,541
THIS IS A LEGITIMATE
CASE OF KIDNAPPING. 

264
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,958
- I BEG YOU.

265
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:26,625
- WELL, RYOKO,
ALL RIGHT.

266
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,250
- I'M COMING, TENCHI.

267
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:34,750
- ( chuckles )
HERE YOU COME, RYOKO.

268
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,666
- NOW FIRE, RYO-OHKI!

269
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:40,708
WHAT'S WRONG, RYO-OHKI?
I SAID "FIRE."

270
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:42,666
- ( meows )

271
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,375
- KENOKI, FIRE!

272
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:45,833
- ( shouts )

273
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:50,041
- ( screams )

274
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:51,083
- OH, GREAT!

275
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:01,333
- ( screams )
- ( stammering )

276
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:03,833
- COME ON, RYO-OHKI!
WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

277
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:04,833
SHOOT BACK!

278
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:06,083
- ( chuckles )

279
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:09,791
BEING IN LOVE WITH A GUY
HAS MADE YOU SOFT, HUH? 

280
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,791
- RYO-OHKI!

281
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:14,125
- OKAY, KENOKI,
FINISH HER!

282
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:17,541
WHAT?

283
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:22,750
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
KENOKI?

284
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:25,750
- ( meows )

285
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:31,166
- I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

286
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,750
IT STOPPED FIRING.

287
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:36,125
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE.

288
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:40,750
- KENOKI IS NOT
OBEYING MY ORDERS.

289
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:42,958
RYO-OHKI IS IGNORING YOURS TOO?

290
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:43,958
- YEP.

291
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:46,458
- JUST AS I THOUGHT.

292
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:48,958
I GUESS WE'LL JUST HAVE TO
SETTLE THE MATTER OURSELVES.

293
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:50,958
- FINE WITH ME.
WHERE SHALL WE DO IT?

294
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:54,625
- I, WASHU, SHALL PREPARE
A SPOT FOR YOU.

295
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:55,833
- HUH?

296
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:07,375
- YEE-HAW!

297
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:10,041
HOW'S THIS NICE AMBIANCE
FOR YOU?

298
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:13,500
- ( all gasp )

299
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:16,125
- YOU ARE ENJOYING THIS,
AREN'T YOU, WASHU?

300
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,166
- MM-HMM.

301
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,041
- HUH?
- HMM?

302
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,708
- SHE'S HERE.
- WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

303
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,375
- WHERE IS TENCHI?

304
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:49,916
- DON'T WORRY.

305
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,875
HE'S RIGHT HERE.

306
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:54,375
- ( grunting )

307
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:55,583
- TENCHI!

308
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:58,500
- IF YOU WIN,
I'LL GIVE HIM BACK TO YOU.

309
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,041
FAIR ENOUGH?

310
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,208
- FAIR ENOUGH.

311
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:08,250
- GOOD LUCK TO YOU,
RYOKO.

312
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,416
- RYOKO, I DON'T CARE
IF YOU DIE,

313
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,166
BUT DON'T LOSE, OKAY?

314
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:44,916
- ( both grunting )

315
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:59,291
- ( shouts )
- ( chuckles )

316
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,166
- ( shouts, grunts  )

317
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,291
- THE GAME IS OVER,
RYOKO.

318
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:17,416
- NO IT'S NOT.

319
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,208
- BYE-BYE, RYOKO.

320
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:22,250
- NOW TENCHI,
LET ME GET YOU OUT OF THERE.

321
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,916
- ( grunts )
- DO NOT MIND RYOKO.

322
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,875
I WILL GET YOU
OUT OF THIS MESS.

323
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:28,166
- AH! WHAT DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE DOING?

324
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,750
- ( giggles )
EXCUSE US, RYOKO,

325
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,166
BUT YOU KNOW
AS WELL AS I

326
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,625
TENCHI AND I WERE ALWAYS
MEANT TO BE TOGETHER.

327
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:36,708
YOU WILL WISH US
GOOD LUCK, WON'T YOU?

328
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:40,291
- AYEKA,
YOU'RE JUST UNBELIEVABLE.

329
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:42,625
- YOUR DEATH WILL
NOT BE IN VAIN.

330
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:43,958
PLEASE EXCUSE US NOW.

331
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:46,666
- WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING?

332
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,000
- ( screams )

333
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:53,791
- ( grunts )

334
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:54,958
- ( groans )

335
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:58,833
- ( grunts )

336
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:02,500
- ( grunts )

337
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:07,958
- YAY!
- WE DID IT.

338
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:09,875
- ( meows )

339

342
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:30,000
- HUH?
- HMM.

343
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,750
- IT'S JUST AS IF WE HAD
PLANNED IN ADVANCE,

344
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,208
ISN'T IT, RYOKO?

345
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:37,541
- OUR FRIENDSHIP
BROUGHT US THIS VICTORY.

346
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:39,208
- ( both laugh )

347
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:44,333
- THIS CAN'T BE TRUE.

348
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:45,500
- IT ISN'T.

349
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,541
- WELL, LET'S SEE NOW.

350
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:55,666
- ALL RIGHT.
YOU WON, RYOKO.

351
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,208
KILL ME THEN.

352
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:59,541
- VERY WELL.

353
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,583
AS YOU WISH IT, NAGI.

354
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:02,625
OH--

355
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:05,583
- ( hisses )

356
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:11,541
- ( meows )

357
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:13,208

- ( sighs )

361
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,041
ALL RIGHT, YOU TWO.

362
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:36,541
LEAVE BEFORE I 
CHANGE MY MIND.

363
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:39,583
- YOU'LL REGRET THIS.

364
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:40,958
- I DOUBT IT.

365
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:43,250
I'VE NEVER EVER REGRETTED
ANYTHING I'VE DONE

366
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:44,625
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

367
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:53,750
- ( meows )

368
00:19:58,333 --> 00:19:59,500
- ( meows )

369
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:01,125
- LET'S GO, KENOKI.

370

- ( meows )

371
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:08,125
- ( howls )

372
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:28,083
- NAGI WAS JUST AS STRONG
AS I HAD HEARD.

373
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:29,291
- YEAH.

374
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:30,875
IF AYEKA HADN'T INTERFERED

375
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:32,541
FOR HER OWN
SELFISH REASONS,

376
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:35,208
NAGI WOULD HAVE WON.

377
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:36,958
- ( meows )

378
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:40,458
- YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT
RYO-OHKI LIKES KENOKI.

379
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:44,083
- WHAT?  SERIOUSLY?

380
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,625
NO WAY.
YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

381
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:48,166
YOU CAN FORGET ABOUT THAT.

382
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,625
- ( meows )

383
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:52,458
- NOW YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO
GET OVER HIM, RYO-OHKI.

384
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:54,666
THERE ARE MUCH BETTER GUYS
JUST WAITING OUT THERE

385
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:55,833
IN THE UNIVERSE FOR YOU.

386
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:57,791
- HUH? YOU MEAN
TO TELL ME

387
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:00,500
RYO-OHKI IS A GIRL?

388
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,583
- GET A CLUE,
WILL YOU, MIHOSHI?

389
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:04,583
- UH-OH.
WHERE'S TENCHI?

390
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:06,916

ABOUT HIM.

00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,041
TENCHI!

392
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:11,791
