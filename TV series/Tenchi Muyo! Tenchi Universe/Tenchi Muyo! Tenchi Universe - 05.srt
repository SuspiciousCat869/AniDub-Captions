- SONIA... 

29
00:01:56,708 --> 00:02:00,625
- ( alarm sounds, speaks )

30
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:02,583
- ( groaning )

31
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:25,083
( yawning )

32
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:39,791
- MIHOSHI, MY PARTNER...

33
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:42,083
IT'S ALREADY BEEN A MONTH
SINCE SHE DIED.

34
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:43,208
- ( rings )

35
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:46,708
- YOU WERE ALWAYS
SUCH A BURDEN TO ME.

36
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,375
BUT NOW,
I'LL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN.

37
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:51,625
AND THAT KNOWLEDGE...

38
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:53,583
MAKES ME SO HAPPY!

39
00:02:57,916 --> 00:03:02,416
MAY YOUR SOUL REST IN PEACE,
MIHOSHI.

40
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,916
WHAT?!  MIHOSHI'S ALIVE?

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,666
- NOW ALL I SAID IS
IT'S POSSIBLE SHE'S STILL ALIVE.

42
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,416
- BUT I THOUGHT MIHOSHI
HAD DIED IN THE LINE OF DUTY,

43
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,583
WHILE PURSUING
THE WANTED CRIMINAL, RYOKO.

44
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:17,083
- WELL, THAT POST
IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM

45
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:19,208
HAS BEEN VACANT
FOR QUITE SOME TIME,

46
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:21,083
SO THEY HAVEN'T REALLY
FOLLOWED UP

47
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,916
THE CASE YET, YOU SEE.

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,125
- ( groans )

49
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:27,000
- BUT DETECTIVE KIYONE,
HERE'S THE THING:

50
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:30,375
SINCE YOU WERE DETECTIVE
FIRST CLASS MIHOSHI'S PARTNER,

51
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:34,041
I WOULD LIKE YOU TO UNDERTAKE
A SEARCH FOR HER IMMEDIATELY.

52
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:36,458
THAT'S AN ORDER.

53
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,583
- I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

54
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:44,250
AND HERE, I THOUGHT MY NIGHTMARE
WAS OVER, ONCE AND FOR ALL.

55
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:47,125
( sobbing )
OH, GOD.

56
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:52,583
PLEASE PLEASE DON'T LET
MIHOSHI BE ALIVE.

57
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,541
- YO!

58
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:10,291
- MM, IT FEELS SO NICE.

59
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:20,833
JUST ANOTHER QUIET DAY.

60
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:28,458
( yawns )

61
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:30,625
FOR SOME REASON
THIS PEACEFUL ATMOSPHERE

62
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,583
MAKES ME SLEEPY.

63
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:52,958
- THANKS FOR WAITING. AND IT'S
JUST THE WAY YOU WANTED IT.

64
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:55,083
- ALL RIGHT,
WE'RE READY FOR THIS.

65
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:57,250
- ( giggles )

66
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:58,833
- HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON NOW?

67
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:02,375
- WE'VE GOT A NEW BATH NOW.
RIGHT?

68
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:05,833
- WHAT DO MEAN? THERE ALREADY
WAS A BATHROOM THERE.

69
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:09,625
- WELL, WE ASKED WASHU TO
REMODEL THE INTERIOR

70
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:12,041
JUST A LITTLE BIT.

71
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:13,875
- OH, WELL THEN,
IS WASHU GOOD AT

72
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:16,041
CONSTRUCTION AS WELL?

73
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:17,875
- BUT YOU GUYS SHOULD
HAVE ASKED IF IT'S OKAY

74
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:18,875
TO CHANGE THE BATHROOM.

75
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:19,875
- HUH?  AAH!

76
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,208
- AAH!

77
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:23,208
- OOH, THIS LOOKS PRETTY COOL.

78
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,208
- ( others cheer )

79
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:31,041
- WHAT IN THE WORLD IS THIS?

80
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:33,000
- I CONNECTED THE INSIDE
OF THE BATHROOM

81
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,750
TO A DIFFERENT DIMENSION.

82
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:36,750
LIKE WHEN I CREATED
MY RESEARCH LAB

83
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:39,208
IN THE STORAGE UNIT.
SAME TECHNIQUE.

84
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:42,416
- ENOUGH WITH CREATING DIFFERENT
DIMENSIONS ALL OVER THE HOUSE.

85
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,458
- TENCHI, YOU SHOULDN'T BE
SO NARROW-MINDED.

86
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:47,958
THE BATH WILL SERVE AS A WAY

87
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:51,250
OF BRINGING OUR WHOLE
GROUP CLOSER TOGETHER.

88
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:52,791
OKAY, EVERYBODY,

89
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:56,041
I THINK WE SHOULD REALLY GET
CLOSE TO EACH OTHER RIGHT NOW.

90
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:58,916
- BUT THIS ONE
IS THE LADIES' BATH.

91
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,083
- YOU TWO SHOULD GO
 TO THE MEN'S BATH.

92
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:02,750
HEE.

93
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:05,000
- ( guys stammering )
- IT'S RIGHT THIS WAY.

94
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:06,750
THERE!
- MEN'S BATH?

95
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,083
BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE
BATHROOM HERE, RIGHT?

96
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:10,208
- HUH?
- UGH.

97
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:13,750
- WELL THEN, 
WE SHOULD GO IN THERE.

98
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:16,291
( giggles )

99
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,583
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?!

100
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:21,750
- HEY, ALL I'M SAYING IS
CLOSENESS IN THE FAMILY

101
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:22,583
IS A GOOD THING,

102
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:24,250
AND-- AND SO IS A GOOD BATH.

103
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,125
- WHAT THE HECK
ARE YOU THINKING?!

104
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:28,250
- ( both grunting )

105
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:29,750
- LET GO OF MY SHIRT.

106
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:31,125
- I'M NOT LETTING GO.

107
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:32,875
- COME ON, WHOSE SIDE
ARE YOU ON?

108
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:35,666
- THOSE GIRLS ARE INSIDE THERE.
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

109
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,958
- THAT'S EXACTLY WHY
I'M PEEPING.

110
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:40,125
- UH-HUH, I KNEW IT.
YOU JUST WANNA PEEP, DON'T YOU?

111
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:42,458
- LET ME GO!

112
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:43,791
I'M COMING IN!

113
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:45,250
HUH?

114
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:46,583
- WHAT IS THIS?

115
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:48,541
IT'S JUST THE SAME OLD BATHROOM.

116
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:51,583
- NOW THIS IS REALLY STRANGE.

117
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,625
- OH, HI, I FORGOT
 TO TELL YOU THIS.

118
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,125
WHEN THE DOOR IS OPENED
BY A MAN,

119
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:00,166
IT DOESN'T LEAD
TO ANOTHER DIMENSION.

120
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,666
- I WOULDN'T MIND
BATHING WITH YOU.

121
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,291
SO DON'T YOU WANNA GO
INSIDE WITH ME?

122
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:10,958
WELL?  WHAT DO YOU SAY,
TENCHI?

123
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:13,916
- GET BACK IN HERE!
THAT'S ENOUGH.

124
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
- OUCH!

125
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,875
- ( girls arguing indistinctly )

126
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,875
- ( piano music playing )

127
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:43,250
- THE HOUSE MUST BE
JUST AHEAD OF ME.

128
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,625
THAT'S WHAT
THE COORDINATES SAY.

129
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:52,583
THAT MUST BE IT.

130
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:01,166
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO WITH DAD.

131
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,000
EW.
- YOU THERE, EXCUSE ME.

132
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,958
- HUH?
- UH, HELLO. ( chuckles )

133
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:08,458
I WANNA ASK YOU SOMETHING.

134
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,083
- WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

135
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:13,541
HMM?

136
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:16,291
- HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
THIS WOMAN BEFORE?

137
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:18,541
- HUH?
SURE, I KNOW HER.

138
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,750
- WHAT?!

139
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,541
DO YOU KNOW WHERE SHE IS NOW?!
TELL ME!  TELL ME!

140
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,375
- OKAY, SHE'S RIGHT OVER THERE.

141
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:27,041
- HUH?

142
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,541
- ( moaning, groaning )

143
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:29,541
- ( gasps )

144
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:32,750
THAT'S IT--

145
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:35,083
MY ALL TOO BRIEF
PEACEFUL MOMENTS

146
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,666
ARE ALL OVER NOW.

147
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,791
- ( squeaking )
- HEY, COME HERE!

148
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,541
WE'RE TRYING TO DRY YOU OFF!

149
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:44,083
- OH, YES,
THAT WAS A NICE BATH.

150
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:45,708
- YES, THAT CERTAINLY WAS.

151
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,666
- LET'S SAY WE TAKE
 ANOTHER ONE LATER.

152
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,083
- EXCELLENT IDEA.

153
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:53,125
- Mihoshi: WOW, KIYONE,
I MISSED YOU!

154
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:54,791
- All: HUH?

155
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:58,250
- IT'S BEEN SO MANY DAYS,
BUT I KNEW YOU'D COME FOR ME.

156
00:08:58,333 --> 00:08:59,916
HOW MANY DAYS
HAS IT BEEN ANYWAY?

157
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,416
DID YOU KNOW I COULDN'T
SLEEP AT NIGHT,

158
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,583
BECAUSE I MISSED YOU SO MUCH?

159
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:05,458
- SO, YOU SLEEP
DURING THE DAYTIME?

160
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:07,750
- WELL WELL,
YOU MUST BE TIRED.

161
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:11,791
YOU'VE COME ALL THIS WAY
TO FIND YOUR PARTNER MIHOSHI.

162
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:15,458
YOU MUST HAVE BEEN
TERRIBLY WORRIED ABOUT HER.

163
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:19,916
- OH, TO SEE MIHOSHI ALIVE
AND WELL MAKES ME SO VERY MAD.

164
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,250
I-- I  MEAN, SO VERY GLAD.
( nervous chuckle )

165
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:25,916
- WE HAVE A SPECIAL CHEMISTRY
TOGETHER, SHE AND I.

166
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,708
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?  WE WERE
SO CONFIDENT TOGETHER, REALLY!

167
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,708
- GOOD FRIENDSHIPS
 BETWEEN TWO WOMEN

168
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:32,625
ARE A BEAUTIFUL THING
INDEED.

169
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:34,958
- ( fake laughter )

170
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:38,375
IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'VE BEEN TAKING
VERY GOOD CARE OF MIHOSHI HERE.

171
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:41,333
- THAT'S RIGHT.
EVERYONE HERE IS SO NICE.

172
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:42,791
OH, LET ME INTRODUCE THEM
TO YOU!

173
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:43,791
- ( gasps )

174
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,958
- THIS IS TENCHI MASAKI.

175
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:47,541
- WE'VE MET, KINDA.

176
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:50,041
- AND THIS IS HIS FATHER,
NOBUYUKI.

177
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:51,583
- HI, NICE TO MEET YOU.

178
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:53,250
- OH...

179
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:56,708
- AND THAT'S THE GRANDFATHER,
KATSUHITO.

180
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,333
- IT'S A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.

181
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:00,750
- KIYONE, KIYONE!

182
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,583
THIS IS THE SPACE PIRATE,
RYOKO.

183
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:05,541
- HI, HOW YOU DOIN'?

184
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:07,333
- ( gasps )

185
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:12,375
NOW WHAT IN THE UNIVERSE IS THIS
MOST WANTED CRIMINAL DOING HERE?

186
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:15,000
- OH, WELL, IT JUST KINDA
SEEMS NATURAL. ( chuckles )

187
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:16,666
- KINDA NATURAL?

188
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,375
- MOVE ON WITH
THE INTRODUCTIONS, WILL YOU?

189
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,333
- I THINK I WILL.
NEXT TO RYOKO

190
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:23,958
IS AYEKA
FROM THE PLANET JURAI.

191
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:25,375
- HELLO.
HOW DO YOU DO?

192
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,708
- ( gasps loudly )

193
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:29,833
YOU MEAN THE PRINCESS AYEKA
WHO'S BEEN MISSING?

194
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:31,500
- AND NEXT TO HER
IS SASAMI.

195
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:32,666
- HI, HOW ARE YOU?

196
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,208
- PRINCESS SASAMI?
HOW DID THE TWO OF THEM

197
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:36,583
END UP HERE?

198
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:39,541
- AND THIS IS THE GENIUS
SCIENTIST WASHU, OF COURSE.

199
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,791
- AAH... OW!

200
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,458
- ( thuds )

201
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:48,333
- YOU MEAN TO TELL ME SHE'S
THAT LEGENDARY MAD SCIENTIST?

202
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:49,916
- MM-HMM!

203
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,375
- DOES SHE HAVE TO MAKE SUCH 
A BIG DEAL OUT OF EVERYTHING?

204
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:55,625
- I HAVE TO SAY, I THINK
HER REACTION IS QUITE NORMAL.

205
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:58,041
- WHAT?  WHAT IS THIS ALL?

206
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:00,041
HOW DID ALL THESE PEOPLE 
COME TO MEET ONE ANOTHER?

207
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:01,791
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

208
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:03,208
- ALL I CAN SAY IS, WELL,

209
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:06,583
JUST THINGS JUST SEEM TO
DEVELOP THIS WAY.

210
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,166
- ( all gasp )

211
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,708
- ( grunts )

212
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:17,250
- SPACE PIRATE RYOKO, I HEREBY
PLACE YOU UNDER ARREST.

213
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,875
- I SEE, YOU'RE NOT KIDDING,
ARE YOU?

214
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:28,750
- YO!

215
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:34,416
YO!

216
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,125
- BOY, THIS IS REALLY YUMMY.

217
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:41,458
- THE RATIO BETWEEN THE POTATOES
AND THE GROUND MEAT

218
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:42,833
IS JUST PERFECT.

219
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:45,791
THIS COULD STAND UP UNDER
ANY SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS.

220
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:49,500
- AND SASAMI COOKED ALL THIS
FINE FOOD, IS THAT RIGHT?

221
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,458
- THAT'S RIGHT, YOU REALLY ARE
A GREAT COOK, SASAMI.

222
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:53,666
- ( giggles )

223
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,458
- HARD TO BELIEVE SASAMI
IS RELATED TO AYEKA.

224
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:59,750
- THAT IS NONE OF YOUR CONCERN.
- HERE, KIYONE.

225
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:01,958
HAVE SOME MORE
IF YOU'RE STILL HUNGRY.

226
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:03,916
- OH, WOW.
THANKS, I AM.

227
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,958
- YOU ARE HUNGRY.
YOU EAT LIKE A HORSE, KIYONE.

228
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:08,958
YOU KNOW THAT?

229
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:10,166
- ( chuckles )

230
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,666
- THE ONE WHO EATS
LIKE A HORSE IS YOU.

231
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,500
- YEAH, I GUESS I AM
THAT KIND OF WAY.

232
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:16,541
( giggles )

233
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,500
- ( all laughing )

234
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:27,500
- WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

235
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:29,416
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SCENE
I WAS JUST IN?

236
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,875
WHAT AM I DOING HERE
EATING LUNCH WITH THESE PEOPLE?

237
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:34,750
- WELL, FOR ONE THING,
IT'S LUNCHTIME.

238
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,250
WE CAN'T HELP THAT.

239
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:37,750
- MIHOSHI!

240
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,833
- BOY, SHE REALLY IS SERIOUS.

241
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:44,166
- NOW DON'T MAKE IT DIFFICULT!

242
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,000
- HOLD ON A MINUTE.

243
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:48,125
I'M RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
OF EATING HERE.

244
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:50,583
- COME ON, MIHOSHI.
- WAIT.

245
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:53,083
OKAY OKAY, SO RYOKO 
IS A VICIOUS PIRATE.

246
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,958
ONE OF THE WORST CRIMINALS EVER,
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND,

247
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,500
IN HER BEHALF, I HAVE TO
SAY THAT SHE DID GIVE ME

248
00:12:58,583 --> 00:12:59,708
THE BIGGER RICE CAKE...

249
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:00,791
- ( groaning )
- ...THE OTHER DAY, REALLY.

250
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:03,041
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

251
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:06,583
- MIHOSHI, YOU'VE GOT TO THINK
BEFORE YOU TALK.

252
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:07,666
- ( sighs )

253
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,333
- AND JUST WHAT SIDE ARE
YOU ON, ANYWAY?

254
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:16,750
- KIYONE, MAY I SAY, YOU ARE
TRULY THE PARAGON OF DETECTIVES.

255
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:19,750
I WOULD LIKE TO ASSIST YOU
IN ARRESTING THIS MOST

256
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,041
VICIOUS PIRATE
AND WANTED CRIMINAL.

257
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:23,958
- WHY, YOU LITTLE TRAITOR!

258
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:26,458
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,
RYOKO?

259
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,458
I NEVER WAS ON YOUR SIDE
TO BEGIN WITH.

260
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:29,875
YOU KNOW THAT, SILLY.

261
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:32,541
- AYEKA, YOU THINK
YOU'RE GONNA BE RID OF ME

262
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:34,833
ONCE I'M ARRESTED,
IS THAT IT, HUH?

263
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:36,416
- HUH?

264
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,250
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, REALLY.

265
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:42,291
I AM JUST TRYING
TO COOPERATE WITH THE POLICE.

266
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:44,791
- YEAH, WELL,
YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET YOUR WAY.

267
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:47,375
MIHOSHI, SOME TEA.

268
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:49,416
- UH-HUH.

269
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,833
- WOULD YOU LOOK AT YOU?
YOU CALL YOURSELF A DETECTIVE?

270
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:56,041
- SORRY, I'M JUST POLITE.

271
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,000
- WAIT RIGHT HERE.
( munches loudly )

272
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:01,750
I'LL BE DONE WITH HER
IN A MINUTE.

273
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:05,208
- THAT'S IT, GIRLS,
STEP OUTSIDE.

274
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:07,166
- ( growls )

275
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:27,875
- AAH!
( grunts )

276
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:33,041
- ( laughs )

277
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,416
- ( moaning )

278
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:38,791
- THAT'S SOMETHING.

279
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:45,708
- ( yells )

280
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,166
- AAH...

281
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:15,458
- MIHOSHI, WHY DON'T YOU
USE THAT?

282
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,875
- ALL RIGHT.

283
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,708
I AM A SPACE DETECTIVE.

284
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:22,541
FIGHTING TO THE DEATH
IS WHAT I DO.

285
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:23,833
IT'S WHAT I AM.

286
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,000
WHOA!

287
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:32,833
WH-- WH-- WHOA!

288
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:34,666
OH, BOY!  OH, BOY!

289
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,333
( screaming )

290
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:41,666
- OH, BOY.

291
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,291
- WELL, THAT'S MIHOSHI FOR YOU.

292
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:46,250
- ( screaming )

293
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,375
- I GOTTA TELL YOU SOMETHING,

294
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,916
YOUR PARTNER
REALLY CRACKS ME UP.

295
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,416
- I'M NOT THAT EASY.

296
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,083
( straining grunt )

297
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,750
- PRETTY GOOD.

298
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:04,833
- HMM.

299
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:06,791
- BUT NOT GOOD ENOUGH!

300
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:09,625
( shouts )

301
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:19,958
THIS FIGHT IS MINE!  HA!

302
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:20,916
- ( screams )

303
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:25,500
- ( grunts )

304
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:27,333
A MAGICAL FORCE FIELD?

305
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:30,458
- ( cackles )

306
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:33,458
AZAKA, KAMIDAKE,
HOLD RYOKO TIGHT...

307
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:35,416
AND DO NOT LET HER GET AWAY.

308
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,416
- Both:
YES, MA'AM.

309
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:46,541
- AZAKA, KAMIDAKE...

310
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:48,875
- WE HAVE TO OBEY
PRINCESS AYEKA'S ORDERS.

311
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:50,916
- WE'RE SORRY ABOUT THIS.

312
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
- ( grunts )
DAMN!

313
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:54,666
- ( laughs )

314
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,375
I THINK I GOT YOU NOW.

315
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:59,166
- FINALLY THE NOTORIOUS
CRIMINAL GOES TO JAIL, HUH?

316
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,833
TOUGH BREAK, RYOKO.

317
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:05,166
- RYOKO, I GUESS I'LL VISIT YOU
IN JAIL, I PROMISE.

318
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,750
- AND I'LL WRITE TO YOU.

319
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:09,250
- HEY, I'M STILL HERE.
STOP TALKING LIKE TH--

320
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:10,250
( grunts )

321
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:11,958
- YOU TAKE IT FROM HERE.

322
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:13,958
- OKAY.

323
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:20,750
YOU ARE CHARGED
UNDER GALAXY POLICE LAW

324
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:24,375
ITEM 2546,
AMENDMENT NINE-SEVEN-THREE.

325
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:26,625
THE SUSPECT HAS
THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT

326
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:28,750
REGARDING ISSUES
TO YOUR DISADVANTAGE.

327
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:30,708
YOU ALSO HAVE THE RIGHT
TO AN ATTORNEY.

328
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:32,958
- ( distant screeching )

329
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:33,958
- HUH?

330
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,041
- ( screeching )

331
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:36,041
- All: HUH?

332
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:38,041
- GET OUT OF MY WAY!

333
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:40,333
- WHAT?
- GET OUT OF MY WAY!

334
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:42,333
- ( all screaming )

335
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:57,375
- EVERYTHING WAS GOING
SO SMOOTHLY...

336
00:17:57,458 --> 00:18:00,000
UNTIL THEY MADE
MIHOSHI MY PARTNER,

337
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:01,958
AND SINCE THEN,
IT'S BEEN A NIGHTMARE.

338
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:04,291
- I KNOW.  WELL...

339
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,250
HERE, HAVE SOME SAKE.

340
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:11,625
MM.
- ( exhales )

341
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:13,541
( groans )
- OH!

342
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,500
- THEN WE WERE DEMOTED
AND ASSIGNED TO A REMOTE SITE,

343
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:19,333
LOSING ALL THE CHANCE
OF PROMOTION TO THE HIGHER RANKS

344
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:21,083
AT HEADQUARTERS.
( exhales deeply )

345
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,250
ALL OF THAT
WAS MIHOSHI'S FAULT!

346
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:25,375
IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF HER!

347
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,000
( burbling )

348
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,625
- ( giggles softly )

349
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:41,375
UM, KIYONE?

350
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,916
- AS PER YOUR REQUEST,
I CONTACTED

351
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,125
THE PLANET JURAI AND TOLD THEM
THAT YOU WERE ON VACATION.

352
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,625
DID I SAY THE RIGHT THING,
PRINCESS?

353
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:53,500
- YES, THANK YOU, KIYONE.

354
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:56,375
I THINK WE NEED A BREAK
IN SOME REMOTE PLACE LIKE THIS.

355
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:58,208
DON'T YOU THINK, SASAMI?

356
00:18:58,291 --> 00:18:59,375
- MM-HMM.

357
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:02,333
- WELL THEN, WE'LL PREPARE
FOR TAKEOFF.

358
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:15,791
- EVERYBODY, THANK YOU
FOR EVERYTHING.

359
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:20,208
I WILL NEVER FORGET YOU ALL.

360
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:21,208
NEVER.

361
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:22,625
- OH, THAT'S SO SWEET,

362
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:25,208
AND I WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER YOU,
MIHOSHI.

363
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,458
- HMM?

364
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,750
- SO LONG, MIHOSHI.

365
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,708
- I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO VISIT YOU OR ANYTHING,

366
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:38,666
BUT TAKE CARE.

367
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:42,291
- ( softly sobbing )

368
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:44,291
- HERE.
- HUH? 

369
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:46,958
- SOME RICE BALLS.
HAVE SOME WHEN YOU'RE HUNGRY

370
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:48,250
ON THE WAY BACK HOME.

371
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,208
HERE, TAKE THEM WITH YOU.

372
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,208
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

373
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:57,500
EVERYBODY, BYE NOW.

374
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:00,458
- GOODBYE.
- BYE-BYE!

375
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:01,958
- All: BYE!
- BYE, MIHOSHI!

376
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,125
- KEEP IN TOUCH.
- I'LL REMEMBER YOU!

377
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:05,458
BYE!

378
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,541
- GOOD-BYE.

379
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,875
- SO, ARE YOU READY
TO GO HOME?

380
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:21,166
- YES.
- ( rapid beeping )

381
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,291
- LOOKS LIKE WE'RE RECEIVING

382
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:24,208
AN ULTRA-SPACE COMMUNICATION.

383
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:28,500
AH, SECTION CHIEF.

384
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:31,333
AS I REPORTED,
I'VE LOCATED DETECTIVE MIHOSHI,

385
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:34,458
AND WE ARE HEADING BACK
IMMEDIATELY.

386
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:36,791
- OH, YOU DON'T NEED TO DO THAT.

387
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:38,291
- WHAT?

388
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:39,916
- YOU HAVE JUST RECEIVED
AN APPOINTMENT

389
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,791
FROM THE CHIEF OF 
THE GALAXY POLICE.

390
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,708
LISTEN.
- Both: HUH?

391
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:48,916
- "AS OF TODAY, MIHOSHI
AND KIYONE ARE ASSIGNED TO EARTH

392
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,791
AS OFFICERS IN CHARGE
OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM AREA."

393
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:53,791
THAT'S ALL.

394
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:56,458
- AAH!
NO, THIS CAN'T BE TRUE!

395
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:59,458
- THE PERSONNEL SECTION CHIEF
WAS VERY HAPPY WE FOUND

396
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:02,333
QUALIFIED OFFICERS.
KEEP UP YOUR GOOD WORK.

397
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:08,000
- WOW.  THIS IS GREAT!
I AM SO HAPPY.

398
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:09,750
NOW WE CAN STAY ON EARTH.

399
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,333
AREN'T YOU HAPPY, KIYONE?

400
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:12,833
WE GET TO
WORK CLOSELY TOGETHER.

401
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:15,166
HA HA!
WE'RE STATIONED ON EARTH!

402
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:18,166
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
THIS IS GONNA BE THE BEST EVER.

403
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,333
THE BEST!
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

404
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:21,708
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT
ON EARTH.

405
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:24,875
- IT'S OVER.
- ( Mihoshi continues )

406
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:28,208
- THIS IS IT.
MY CAREER IS DOWN THE TOILET.

407
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:29,916
OH...
( sighs )

408
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,875
- ON EARTH, ON EARTH!
OH, YES YES YES!

409
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:42,250
- ( music playing )

410
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:54,000
- ( woman singing in Japanese )

411
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:25,708
- Tenchi: IN OUR NEXT EPISODE,
KIYONE AND MIHOSHI

412
00:23:25,791 --> 00:23:28,541
SETTLE DOWN AS ROOMMATES
IN A TINY STUDIO APARTMENT

413
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:30,458
IN AN OLD BUILDING
FACING WEST.

414
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:32,958
- WE'LL BE FRIED
IN THIS AFTERNOON'S SUN.

415
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:34,166
- Tenchi: EVEN THOUGH
THE RENT THEY SHARE

416
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:35,375
IS AS LOW AS IT COULD BE,

417
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:37,083
THEY NOW HAVE TO WORK
DAY AND NIGHT

418
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:38,375
ON PART-TIME JOBS TO KEEP UP

419
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,625
WITH THE HIGH COST OF
LIVING ON EARTH.

420
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:42,000
AND WHENEVER THEY RECEIVE
A DUTY CALL,

421
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:44,041
FLY OUT TO SPACE
IN THE AGAMI.

422
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:46,000
HANG ON, RESIDENT OFFICERS
OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM,

423
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:48,375
COMING UP NEXT IS
"NO NEED FOR RESIDENT OFFICERS."

424
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:50,375
- Kiyone:
IT'S UNQUESTIONABLY PATHETIC.
