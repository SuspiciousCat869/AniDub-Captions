00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:16,625
- SO THERE'S REALLY
NOTHING LEFT, SASAMI?

30
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:19,875
HMM. AW.

31

HMM...

32
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:25,000
WHAT IS THIS?

33
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:28,208
- SORRY. NO MORE
SNACKS FOR AWHILE.

34
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:30,125
WE'RE ALMOST OUT OF FOOD.

35
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:31,666
- I SEE.

36
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,041
WE'LL HAVE TO
ASK KIYONE TO STOP

37
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:35,916
AND DO SOME GROCERY SHOPPING,
I GUESS.

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000

- WHOA!

00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:39,791
- OOH!
- AAH!

40
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:43,166
- OHH.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

41
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,958

WHAT'S GOING ON, KIYONE.

00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:54,583
- ( stammers )
HOW CAN YOU BE SO UNAWARE?

ENGINE POWER'S NOW
GOING DOWN TO 50, 40.

44
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:59,083
- WELL, WHAT'S THE MATTER?
- NOT NOW!

45
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:00,958
- HEY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN HERE?

46
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:03,625
IT SOUNDS LIKE THE ENGINE'S
ABOUT TO STOP, YOU GUYS.

47
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:06,375
- I KNOW THAT.
I'M WORKING ON IT RIGHT NOW.

48
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:09,250
- KIYONE, I TOLD YOU
YOU SHOULD LEARN TO RELAX.

49
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:11,000
- AND YOU SHOULD
LEARN TO PANIC!

IT'S BROKEN.

54
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,541
- YO!

55
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:49,875
- RIGHT.

56
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:51,875
YOU WANT TO ME
TO FIX THIS.

57
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:53,125
- All: YEP.

58
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:54,875
- ME FIX THIS?
- All: MM-HMM.

59
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:56,750
- LET ME MAKE THIS
CLEAR FOR YOU.

60
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:58,958
I'M A SCIENTIST,
NOT A MECHANIC. 

61
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:00,333
NOW I HAVE SOME
RESEARCH TO DO,

62
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:01,750
SO IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME.

63
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,000
- WAIT, WASHU.

64
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:04,625
I MEAN, PROFESSOR WASHU,

65
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:06,750
THE GREATEST SCIENTIST
IN THE UNIVERSE.

66
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,000
I KNOW YOU CAN DO IT.

67
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:09,875
- YES.
YOU'RE A GENIUS,

68
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,125
AND I AGREE WITH KIYONE,
WASHU.

69
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:14,125
THE GREATEST GENIUS
IN THE UNIVERSE

70
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,541
SHOULD BE ABLE
TO DO THIS.

71
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:17,333
- SINCE YOU PUT IT THAT WAY,

72
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:20,166
FIXING ENGINE TROUBLE
SHOULD BE A PIECE OF CAKE.

73
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,500
- All: WE THOUGHT SO.

74
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:24,666
YOU'RE A GENIUS,
WASHU.

75
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,583
- IT'S NO BIG DEAL
FOR A GENIUS.

76
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:28,958
( laughs )

77
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,125
- YES, WASHU.
YOU'RE A GENIUS!

78
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:34,833
- THE GREATEST
IN THE UNIVERSE.

79
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:38,000
- Both: GENIUS WASHU,
GENIUS WASHU!

80
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:40,041
- THANK GOD SHE'S 
SO EASY TO PLEASE.

81
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:41,583
- NO KIDDING.

82
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:43,166
- ( meows )

83
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,833
- HEY, BE QUIET,
WILL YOU?

84
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:45,916
- ( meows )

85
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,833
- HA, HERE THEY ARE.
I GOT THEM.

86
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,041
- ( crashing )
- WHAT?!

87
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:56,000
HELLO?
ANYBODY IN THERE?

88
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:57,000
- ( chuckles )

89
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:01,083
- ( screams )

90
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:09,875
- OKAY. I'M GONNA USE
AN S-32 PLUG HERE.

91
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:11,500
HMM.

92
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,666
NOW I NEED SOME ADHESIVE.

93
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,958
WHERE IS THAT ADHESIVE?

94
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:16,458
WHERE ARE YOU, ADHESIVE?

95
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:19,041
- IS THIS WHAT YOU NEED?

96
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:20,875
- OH, THANK YOU, MIHOSHI.

97
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:23,708
I'LL JUST STABILIZE THIS,
AND THEN I--

98
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:24,958
HUH?!

99
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:26,916
( screams )

100
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:31,416
- MAYBE THIS IS WHAT 
SHE SHOULD HAVE USED?

101
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,708
- ( coughs )
- I DON'T KNOW.

102
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:33,916
WHAT DO YOU THINK,
WASHU?

103
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,625
- YOU GET OUT OF HERE.

104
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:49,583
- JUST WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

105
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:52,250
- UH, WHAT'S GOING ON HERE,
HUH?

106
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:53,250
- HMM?

107
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:56,166
HUH?

108
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:58,916
- ( sniffs, meows )

109
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,416
- All: WHA--?

110
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,083
- ( meows )

111
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:04,583
- HAVE YOU BEEN
STEALING OUR FOOD?

112
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:05,625
- ( meows )

113
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,125
- IDIOT.

114
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:10,916
WHY ARE YOU
CARRYING THAT AROUND?

115
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,875
I TOLD YOU TO
EAT THEM IN PRIVATE.

116
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:13,916
- ( meows )

117
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,708
- JUST AS I THOUGHT.
- HMM?

118
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:19,666
- SO YOU'RE BEHIND
ALL OF THIS, AREN'T YOU?

119
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,875
- SO WHAT IF I AM?
IT'S ONLY A LITTLE FOOD.

120
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:23,250
DON'T BE SO UPTIGHT.

121
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:25,416
- YOU DON'T EVEN
FEEL GUILTY.

122
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,500
- DON'T FROWN TOO MUCH, OR THOSE
WRINKLES WILL NEVER DISAPPEAR.

123
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:30,291
- HOW DARE YOU SAY THAT!

124
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:32,500
- LET'S CALM DOWN,
BOTH OF YOU.

125
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:33,833
WHAT'S GONE IS GONE.

126
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:35,833
WE NEED TO GO TO
THE GROCERY STORE.

127
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:38,375
- BUT HOW? THE SHIP 
IS STALLED, GRANDPA.

128
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:40,125
- YEAH, YEAH.

129
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:42,583
WELL, I'LL GO.
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

130
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:43,916
- HUH?

131
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,166
IT SEEMS ONLY PROPER.

132
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,791
- I'LL NEED SOME MONEY.
- HUH?

133
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,833
- I'LL GO.
MONEY, PLEASE.

134
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:53,458
- I SUPPOSE YOU DO
NEED SOME MONEY.

135
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:54,500
HERE.

136
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:55,791
- RIGHT.

137
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,041
- WHAT?!

138
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,958
- NOW...

139
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:00,458
LET'S GO, TENCHI.

140
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:02,708
- NO, WAIT A MINUTE.
TENCHI CAN'T GO!

141
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:05,625
WE NEED ALL THE HANDS WE CAN
GET TO FIX THE ENGINE TROUBLE.

142
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:07,958
WE HAVE A LOT OF
THINGS TO DO.

143
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:09,416
RIGHT, TENCHI?

144
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,666
- UH, YEAH.

145
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,000
- RIGHT.
- ( clears throat )

146
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:15,208
- HMM?
- I COULD COME ALONG.

147
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:16,416
- I'M OUT OF HERE.
SEE YOU.

148
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,375
- UH...

149
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,666
- TENCHI?

150
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:29,000
DO YOU THINK RYOKO IS GOING
TO BE OKAY ALL BY HERSELF?

151
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:32,083
- I THINK SHE'S
GOING TO BE JUST FINE.

152
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:34,333
- HMM.

153
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:36,333
WELL...

154
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:38,000
SHE BROUGHT IT ON HERSELF.

155
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,250
SHE HAS TO FACE THE MUSIC.

156
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,333
- ( beeping )

157
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:45,000
- THERE.
IT'S ALL DONE.

158
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:46,291
NOW THAT THIS IS COMPLETE,

159
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:48,166
ALL I HAVE TO DO NEXT IS...

160
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,625
- I'LL HIT THAT SWITCH.

161
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:53,875

00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:54,000
- WHAT IS IT?
- ( meows )

329
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:56,333
- OH, I FORGOT!

330
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:58,000
WELL, THEY CAN WAIT.

331
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,208
- ( meows )

332
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:05,500
- ALL RIGHT.
ENOUGH ALREADY.

333
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:06,708
TIME TO GO BACK.

334
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:09,791
HERE. THAT SHOULD
BE ENOUGH, I THINK.

335
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:14,750
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH,
MA'AM.

336
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:17,250
- HMM?

337
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:19,250
UHH...

338
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,291
( gasps )

339
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:23,375
( gasps )

340
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:24,666
( whimpers )

341
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:29,250
- ( crowd cheering )

342
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,833
- AROUND THE STRETCH THEY COME.

343
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:34,208
IS IN THE LEAD

344
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:37,291
FOLLOWED CLOSELY BY...

345
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,375
- COME ON! LET'S GO!

346
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:39,708
RUN, LET'S GO!

347
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:40,666
- GO!

348
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:44,250
- ALL RIGHT. GO! GO!

349
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:47,041
COME ON.

350
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:49,750
- AND COMING UP
FAR FROM THE OUTSIDE,

351
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:51,541
CROSSING THE FINISH LINE
IS...

352
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:52,875
- ( cheering )

353
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:55,083
- ONE MINUTE AND 29 SECONDS.

354
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:56,083
- OH NO.

355
00:16:58,166 --> 00:16:59,333
I LOST.

356
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:01,916
I REALLY CANNOT
BELIEVE THIS.

357
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:09,291
( sighs )

358
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:12,291
ARE YOU HUNGRY?

359
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,333
- ( meows )

360
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:17,750
- OH, I KNOW.

361
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,250
OH, YES.

362
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:22,000
I WONDER HOW
THOSE GUYS ARE DOING ALSO.

363
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,666
TENCHI.

364
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:25,958
( gasps )

365
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:28,250
BANK OF JURAI, HUH?

366
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:30,583
UH...

367
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:32,250
AHH.

368
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:34,541
- RYOKO...

369
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:39,666
- WE SHOULDN'T HAVE
TRUSTED RYOKO.

370
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,625
- WHAT NOW, TENCHI?

371
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:43,500
- HEY NOW,
DON'T YOU WORRY.

372
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:44,625
SHE'LL BE HERE SOON.

373
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:45,833
JUST TRUST ME.

374
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:47,583
- BUT TENCHI...

375
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:48,958
- IT'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT.

376
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:50,791
YOU KNOW, SASAMI, 
BACK HOME ON EARTH

377
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:51,791
WE HAVE A FABLE.

378
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:55,833
IT IS A TALE
OF TWO FRIENDS,

379
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:58,458
AND THE STORY'S MORAL
IS THAT IF YOU TRUST SOMEONE,

380
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:00,791
YEAH, IF YOU TRUST SOMEONE,

381
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:02,500
YOUR FAITH WILL
BE REWARDED.

382
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:07,583
- YEAH, BUT RYOKO IS
A SPACE PIRATE AND ALL.

383
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,666
- UH...

384
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:15,375
- ( repeated ) 
UH-HUH. UH-HUH.

385
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:16,875
- ( chuckles )
THIS SHOULD BE MORE THAN

386
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:18,291
ENOUGH MONEY, I THINK.

387
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:19,916
( giggles )
- Both: HUH?!

388
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:24,791
- ( siren blares )

389
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,750
- OKAY.
HERE THEY ARE.

390
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,166
RYO-OHKI!

391
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,083
- ( meows )

392
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:50,875
- ( crowd gasps )

393
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:52,000
- SHE'S ON THE ROOF.

394
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:53,291
- OH!
- HMM.

395
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:55,000
- LOOK OUT.
- ( gasps )

396
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:57,291
- ( shudders )
IT'S THE SPACE PIRATE.

397
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,208
- LET'S GET OUT OF HERE,
RYO-OHKI.

398
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:01,208
- ( meows )

399
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:13,041
- THE REPAIRS ARE
FINISHED FINALLY.

400
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:14,125
( sighs )

401
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:15,541
- WASHU?

402
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,208
- CAN WE GO NOW?

403
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:19,583
CAN WE GO TO A PLANET WHERE WE
CAN GET SOMETHING TO EAT NOW,

404
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:20,500
PLEASE?

405
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:22,791
- BUT RYOKO ISN'T
HERE YET.

406
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:25,708
- LET'S JUST FORGET ABOUT
THAT TRAITOR, ALL RIGHT?

407
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:28,125
- ( gasps ) 
LOOK, AYEKA.

408
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,375
- Both: HUH?

409
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:34,250
- HI, GUYS. I'M BACK.

410
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,958
I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR
WAITING FOR ME SO PATIENTLY. 

411
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:38,208
- ( meows )

412
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,083
- ( all gasp )

413
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:43,583
- TENCHI, YOU MISSED ME,
DIDN'T YOU?

414
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:45,250
AYEKA,
GET ME SOME TEA.

415
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:46,916
- WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?

416
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,375
AND WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG,
RYOKO?

417
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:50,416
- HERE.

418
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,750
- AHH.

419
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,166
MMM.

420
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,958
- I'M SORRY.

421
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:56,625
EVERYTHING TOOK A LITTLE
LONGER THAN I THOUGHT.

422
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:57,958
- SEE?

423
00:19:58,041 --> 00:19:59,916
MY FLOWER TOLD ME
THE TRUTH.

424
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,625
I WAS RIGHT, KIYONE.

425
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:03,500
- YEAH, YOU MUST HAVE
GOTTEN SIDETRACKED.

426
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:04,750
- ( chuckles )

427
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:06,083
PLEASE DON'T CONCERN YOURSELF

428
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:07,708
WITH THE MINOR DETAILS.

429
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:10,291
- YOU WERE SO RIGHT,
TENCHI.

430
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,125
OUR TRUST WAS
TRULY REWARDED.

431
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:15,583
- YEP.  THAT'S RIGHT.

432
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,583
- COME ON.
LET'S FIX SOMETHING TO EAT.

433
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,625
- YEAH.
LET'S HAVE A FEAT.

434
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:21,458
- YAY!
- ALL RIGHT!

435
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:22,500
- All: WHOA!

436
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:32,333
- WHAT'S GOING ON THIS TIME?

437
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:38,791
- ( all scream )

438
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:43,333
- All: HUH?

439
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:44,416
- IT'S ALL MONEY!

440
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,791
- UH...

441
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,458
WITH THIS MUCH MONEY,
WE CAN GO TO ANY

442
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:49,458
RESTAURANTS WE WANT.
I GUARANTEE YOU.

443
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:50,625
- RYOKO!

444
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,791
YOU DIDN'T, DID YOU?

445
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:54,875
- THE BANK I ROBBED
WAS THE BANK OF JURAI,

446
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:56,458
SO THERE'S NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

447
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:57,750
- THE BANK OF JURAI?!

448
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,291
THE MONEY IN
THE BANK OF JURAI

449
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:00,583
IS MY PEOPLE'S MONEY.

450
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:02,458
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND
ANYTHING, RYOKO?

451
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:04,875
- ( all scream )

452
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:14,333
- ( sighs )

453
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:17,708
- WE'RE EVEN INVOLVED
IN A BANK ROBBERY.

454
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:18,833
- TENCHI?

455
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:21,041
OUR TRUST WAS NOT REWARDED.

456
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:22,125
- THAT'S RIGHT.

457
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:23,083
- ( stomach growls )

458
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:27,000
- I'M SO HUNGRY.

459
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:28,000
- YEAH, ME TOO.

460
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:29,125
