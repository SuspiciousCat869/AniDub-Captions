- YO!

30
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,916
- RYO-OH'S TREE HAS
GROWN SO MUCH.

31

IT'S AMAZING.

SHE'S A REAL PARASITE,
YOU KNOW THAT?

51
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,500
SHE REALLY
DRIVES ME CRAZY.

52
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:05,791
- RYOKO, YOU SHOULD HELP OTHERS
AROUND THE HOUSE SOMETIMES.

53
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:11,333
- I SUPPOSE SO.
I AM SPONGING OFF YOU, AREN'T I?

54
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:12,875
I'M QUITE A MOOCH,

I DON'T CARE ABOUT HER.

58
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,833
- OH, RYOKO.

59
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:22,333
- HEY, TENCHI?

60
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:23,333
- NOW WHAT IS IT?

61
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:24,666
- HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN

62
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,833
SINCE AYEKA AND I CAME HERE,
TENCHI?

63
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:28,250
DO YOU REMEMBER?

64
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:30,500
- I GUESS IT'S BEEN
ABOUT THREE MONTHS.

65
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:33,208
- REALLY.
JUST THREE MONTHS, HUH?

66
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:34,375
- I BELIEVE THAT'S RIGHT.

67
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:38,666
- TENCHI...

68
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,125
WE ARE HAVING FUN.

69
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:42,541
AND EVERY DAY HERE
IS LIKE A DREAM.

70
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,833
I REALLY HOPE IT'S GOING
TO BE LIKE THIS FOREVER.

71
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,041
- HUH?

72
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:57,416

- ALL RIGHT, GREAT!

74
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:13,458
FANTASTIC!

75
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:15,583
I'M GETTING A PROMOTION.

76
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:17,291
I CAN GO BACK TO HEADQUARTERS.

77
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:19,291
OH, I'VE BEEN WAITING

78
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:20,875

90
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:51,250
THEY CAN'T DO THIS TO ME.

91
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:53,333
WHAT AM I EVER GONNA
DO WITHOUT YOU?

92
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:55,583

DON'T WORRY, MIHOSHI.

93
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:57,250

164
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,958
- WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU GUYS?

165
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:07,083
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

166
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:08,416
- ( meows )

167
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,666
- WELL, THIS GENIUS
IS TOTALLY CAUGHT OFF GUARD,

168
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,125
I CAN TELL YOU THAT.

169
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:14,458
NOW IT'S MY TURN.

170
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:16,291
NOW I MUST GET
BACK AT THEM. 

171
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:19,291
- WASHU, WHAT HAPPENED?
TELL ME!

172
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:21,750
- HOLD ON A MINUTE.
I'LL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT.

173
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,791
- HUH? HEY...

174
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,750
WHERE IS AYEKA?

175
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,125
RYOKO ISN'T HERE EITHER.
- ( crying )

176
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,791
- AND SASAMI IS MISSING TOO.

177
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:32,000
I DON'T GET IT, WASHU.
WHY AREN'T THEY HERE? 

178
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:34,375
- DIDN'T I SAY I'D
TELL YOU IN A MINUTE?

179
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,458
TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT...

180
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:47,333
WE FOUND OURSELVES
ON A SPACESHIP,

181
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:49,166
INCLUDING YOUR HOUSE
AND EVERYTHING.

182
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:53,708
THE SHIP BELONGED TO
PLANET JURAI'S MILITARY.

183
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:56,083
- JURAI'S MILITARY?

184
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:58,166
- SUCH RUDE BEHAVIOR.

185
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,083
DO YOU REALIZE I AM
THE CROWN PRINCESS OF JURAI?

186
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:03,041
I GUESS THE COUNCIL
MUST HAVE ORDERED YOU

187
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:05,333
TO BRING ME BACK TO
THE PLANET JURAI,

188
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:06,708
BUT I HAVE ALREADY TOLD THEM

189
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:08,500
THAT I WAS GOING TO STAY
HERE FOR AWHILE.

190
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:10,666
- YOUR HIGHNESS,
I'M AFRAID THAT...

191
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,333
BRINGING YOU BACK
TO THE PLANET JURAI

192
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:13,666
WAS NOT OUR INTENTION.

193
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,666
- EXPLAIN YOURSELF.
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

194
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,000
- WE'VE COME TO ARREST YOU,
YOUR HIGHNESS.

195
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,125
- TO ARREST ME?

196
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:23,333
- All: HUH?!

197
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:26,166
- HUH?
( laughs )

198
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,666
YOU'RE JOKING.
ARREST ME.

199
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,083
ON WHAT CHARGES?

200
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:31,416
- YOU ARE CHARGED 
WITH HIGH TREASON.

201
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,375
- NO WAY.

202
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:39,791
- SO THAT'S WHY ONLY THE FOUR
OF US WERE SENT BACK.

203
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,583
- AND LOOK WHAT HAPPENED
TO OUR HOUSE.

204
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:49,166
- OUR HOUSE!
YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT'S IT?

205
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,625
- NOT THAT I'M NOT GLAD 
THEY GAVE IT BACK TO US,

206
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:53,208
BUT YOU KNOW.

207
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,375
- THEY COMPRESSED IT
DOWN TO A PORTABLE SIZE.

208
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:56,541
THOUGHTFUL, HUH?

209
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:59,125
- I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

210
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:00,541
- BELIEVE IT.

211
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:03,375
CHECK OUT AZAKA
AND KAMIDAKE.

212
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:05,208
- UH...

213
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:06,541
( screams )

214
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,208
WHERE IS SASAMI?

215
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:10,166
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
HAPPENED TO HER, WASHU?

216
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,750
WELL OF COURSE THEY CONSIDER HER

217
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,541
TO BE A PARTNER IN
THE REBELLION.

218
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,041
- I SEE.

219
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,458
SO THEY TOOK HER
INTO CUSTODY ALSO.

220
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,958
- AND RYOKO?

221
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:22,583
- AH, YES, RYOKO.

222
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:25,458
- WHAT?!
YOU CANNOT ARREST ME.

223
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:28,166
THERE MUST BE SOME
KIND OF MISUNDERSTANDING.

224
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,750
- HEY, AYEKA, MY DEAR.

225
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:31,958
- HMM?

226
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:34,000
- THERE MUST HAVE BEEN
A COUP OR SOMETHING,

227
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:35,791
AND YOUR FAMILY
WAS REPLACED.

228
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:38,916
HEY, IT HAPPENS.
WHAT CAN I TELL YOU?

229
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,583
- ( groans )
STAY OUT OF THIS!

230
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,125
- OH WELL.

231
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:44,750
SO JURAI'S ROYAL FAMILY
IS NOW OUT, HUH?

232
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:46,333
THEY SAY WHEN DYNASTIES FALL,

233
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:47,791
THE HEADS WILL ROLL.

234
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,250
- THEY DO NOT SAY THAT!

235
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:52,125
- I DON'T WANT YOU
TO GET DEPRESSED NOW.

236
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:54,291
LIFE IN A CELL ISN'T
THAT BAD, PRINCESS. 

237
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:55,791
( laughs )

238
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:03,916
- NO WAY!

239
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,291
SHE'S THE UNIVERSE'S
MOST WANTED SPACE PIRATE!

240
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:08,791
- HUH? RYOKO. YOU'RE RIGHT!

241
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:11,750
- ( laughs )
HUH?

242
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:16,208
- SO RYOKO WAS ALSO ARRESTED
 BY JURAI'S MILITARY, I SEE.

243
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:17,958
- AND UP AGAINST
JURAI'S MILITARY FORCES,

244
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:19,958
EVEN RYOKO
COULDN'T GET AWAY.

245
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:28,541
- ( meows )

246
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,875
- HMM.

247
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:35,416
- YES, I KNOW.

248
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,958
- YO!

249
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:52,500
- HELLO? SOMEBODY, ANYBODY!

250
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:54,833
WHO DO YOU THINK I AM
IN HERE, ANYWAY?

251
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:57,875
TREATING THE CROWN PRINCESS OF
JURAI'S ROYAL FAMILY LIKE THIS.

252
00:12:57,958 --> 00:12:59,958
YOU WILL PAY FOR THIS,
YOU KNOW.

253
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:01,333
- RYO-OHKI.

254
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:03,500
CAN YOU HEAR ME,
RYO-OHKI?

255
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,666
- LET ME OUT OF HERE NOW,
I TELL YOU!

256
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,416
OR YOU SHALL BE
SEVERELY PUNISHED.

257
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,833
HEY, SOMEBODY!

258
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:10,416
- ( groans )

259
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,833
KEEP IT DOWN, WILL YOU?

260
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,416
I'M TRYING TO CONTACT
RYO-OHKI HERE.

261
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,833
I CAN'T CONCENTRATE AT ALL
WITH YOU SCREAMING LIKE THAT.

262
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:18,333
- THIS CELL IS WHERE
YOU BELONG.

263
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:19,875
WHAT ARE YOU
COMPLAINING FOR?

264
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:21,875
- CAN YOU EXPLAIN SOMETHING.

265
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:23,875
HOW DID THIS ALL HAPPEN,
AYEKA?

266
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:26,875
- I HAVE ABSOLUTELY
NO IDEA.

267
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:27,833
I'M SORRY.

268
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:33,083
- WELL, SINCE JURAI'S
MILITARY IS INVOLVED,

269
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:35,708
SOMETHING HAPPENED ON JURAI.

270
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:37,541
THERE MUST HAVE BEEN
AN INCIDENT.

271
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,208
- I HOPE NOT.

272
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:42,583
- PROBABLY BECAUSE YOU'RE SO
UNPOPULAR WITH THE JURAIANS.

273
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:45,375
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
LISTEN TO ME.

274
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,333
JURAI'S ROYAL FAMILY
IS OF GOOD LINEAGE, 

275
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:49,750
AND THE PEOPLE JUST ADORE US
SO MUCH, I TELL YOU.

276
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,250
- ENOUGH ABOUT THAT.

277
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:53,000
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO US NOW?

278
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,875
- WHEN YOU'RE CHARGED
WITH HIGH TREASON,

279
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,125
THE MOST COMMON SENTENCE
WOULD BE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT,

280
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:57,916
WOULDN'T IT?

281
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,208
- UH...

282
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:01,125
WELL, IF YOUR CASE
GOES TO TRIAL,

283
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:03,583
YOU WON'T GET AWAY WITH
THAT MERE 700 YEARS

284
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:05,083
OF IMPRISONMENT THIS TIME.

285
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:06,583
- ( both scowl )

286
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:08,375
- HUH?

287
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:11,500
- HEY! WHO IS IN CHARGE HERE?
- RYO-OHKI, COME IN, QUICKLY.

288
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:14,375
- BRING THE PERSON WHO IS
RESPONSIBLE AROUND HERE.

289
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:15,541
CAN'T YOU HEAR ME?!

290
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:17,750
- I TOLD YOU TO KEEP IT DOWN,
DIDN'T I?

291
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:21,625
- WE HAVE TAKEN
THE PRINCESSES AYEKA AND SASAMI

292
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:23,250
INTO CUSTODY.

293
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:25,416
AS WE PLANNED,
WE WILL JOIN THE FLEET

294
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,500
AT 34 HUNDRED HOURS EXACTLY.

295
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:31,416
- WELL DONE. LORD YOSHO WILL
 BE VERY HAPPY TO HEAR THAT.

296
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,750
- ADMIRAL?

297
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,416
- WHAT IS IT?

298
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,083
- MAY I ASK ABOUT OUR PLAN?

299
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,166
WHY DID THE COUNCIL
DECIDE TO--?

300
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,250
- WE SOLDIERS SIMPLY
HAVE TO OBEY ORDERS,

301
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,291
NOT ASK QUESTIONS,
CAPTAIN.

302
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:45,958
YOU NEED NOT THINK ABOUT
ANYTHING ELSE, UNDERSTOOD?

303
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,333
- UH, UNDERSTOOD, SIR.

304
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,458
- CAPTAIN, AN UNIDENTIFIED
FLYING OBJECT IS APPROACHING US

305
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:54,541
FROM PLANET EARTH.

306
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:55,708
- REALLY?

307
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:02,541
- I THINK IT'S A PATROL SHIP

308
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:04,333
OF THE GALAXY POLICE.

309
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:07,291
- MUST BE THOSE POLICE
THAT WERE WITH THE PRINCESS.

310
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:10,000
- I'M A GALAXY POLICE OFFICER

311
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:12,291
ASSIGNED TO THIS
SOLAR SYSTEM AREA.

312
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:13,666
- AS I INFORMED YOU,

313
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,125
WE ARE FOLLOWING
PLANET JURAI'S DIRECT ORDERS.

314
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:19,083
THE GALAXY POLICE SHOULD NOT
INTERFERE, DETECTIVE.

315
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:20,958
DO I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR?

316
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:23,541
- THIS AREA IS
OUR JURISDICTION.

317
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:26,208
THE SPACE PIRATE RYOKO
IS A WANTED CRIMINAL. 

318
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:29,000
WE REQUEST THAT YOU AT LEAST
HAND HER OVER TO US.

319
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,791
- INSIDE THIS BATTLESHIP
IS JURAI'S TERRITORY.

320
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:33,791
SINCE RYOKO WAS
ARRESTED ON BOARD,

321
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:35,583
WE WILL TAKE HER
TO THE PLANET JURAI

322
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:36,708
FOR TRIAL.

323
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:38,958
THAT IS OUR NORMAL PROCEDURE.

324
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:42,041
- BUT OUR SUPERIORS
WILL BE UPSET.

325
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:43,708
- THAT PATROL SHIP'S
STILL APPROACHING.

326
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,166
- HALT YOUR SHIP IMMEDIATELY,

327
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:48,000
OTHERWISE WE MUST ATTACK.

328
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:49,583
THIS IS NOT NEGOTIABLE.

329
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,000
IF YOU HAVE ANY COMPLAINTS,

330
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,000
TAKE THEM UP WITH
FLEET HEADQUARTERS.

331
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,166
- BUT LISTEN, PLEASE,
CAPTAIN.

332
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,166
- NO!
- ( gasps )

333
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,833
I CAN'T GO ANY FURTHER.

334
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,166
- COME ON NOW.

335
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,458
YOU HAVE TO GET CLOSER.
JUST A LITTLE BIT CLOSER.

336
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:06,041
- THE PATROL SHIP
HASN'T STOPPED YET, CAPTAIN.

337
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:07,166
- READY TO FIRE!

338
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:10,750
- ( gasps )

339
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:12,583
- EVERYONE PAY ATTENTION.

340
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:16,625
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

341
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:19,250
THIS IS MY LATEST INVENTION.

342
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:24,541
- All: HUH? WHAT?

343
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,750
- HERE IT IS.

344
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:35,000
- All: HUH?

345
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:38,000
- THIS DOOR FUNCTIONS
AS A PORTAL.

346
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:40,500
- HUH?
- WHAT?!

347
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,416
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

348
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,375
WHY DIDN'T WE USE THIS
EARLIER, WASHU?

349
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:45,708
TELL ME, PLEASE.

350
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:48,208
- BECAUSE IT'S RANGE
 IS ONLY 800 METERS.

351
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:50,333
IT DOESN'T WORK LIKE
IT WOULD IN A CARTOON!

352
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:53,250
- WELL, I GUESS WE'D
BETTER HURRY, HUH?

353
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:54,500
- THAT'S RIGHT.

354
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:06,791
- BE CAREFUL,
AND GOOD LUCK TO YOU ALL.

355
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:15,708
- NOW WE'RE ALREADY 
IN THEIR BATTLESHIP.

356
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:22,666
- SO THIS IS IT?

357
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,250
- I THINK WE'RE CLEAR NOW,
KIYONE.

358
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:26,583
- ROGER.

359
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,750
- ( panting )

360
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:43,291
WHICH WAY SHOULD WE GO?

361
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:46,041
- CAN YOU SENSE WHERE
RYOKO MIGHT BE?

362
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:47,500
- ( meows )

363
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:48,958
- THE PLACE WHERE
THEY'RE LOCKED UP

364
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:50,458
IS PROBABLY SHIELDED.

365
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:53,458
I'M AFRAID TELEPATHY
WON'T WORK HERE, TENCHI.

366
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:56,458
- WELL THEN, HOW ARE WE GONNA
FIND OUT THEIR LOCATION, HUH?

367
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:59,625
WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING, GRANDPA?

368
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:01,791
- QUIT WASTING TIME,
EVERYONE,

369
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:02,958
AND HURRY UP.

370
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,125
- WHAT?

371
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,500
- WAIT.
HOLD ON A MINUTE.

372
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:06,833
ARE YOU SURE IT'S THAT WAY?

373
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:08,541
HOW DO YOU KNOW
IT'S THAT WAY? 

374
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:11,916
- I HAVE A HUNCH.

375
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:17,666
- OH.

376
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,708
- ( panting )

377
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:21,708
- CAPTAIN, INTRUDERS
INSIDE THE SHIP.

378
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,291
- INTRUDERS?

379
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:26,916
- HUH?

380
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:43,666
- ( grunts )
- ( shouting )

381
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,500
- AAH!

382
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:46,916
( grunting )

383
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:54,458
- ( shouting, grunting )

384
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:00,708
- ( grunting )

385
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:09,541
- Both: BRAVO.

386
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:11,333
- LET'S GO.

387
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:14,250
- ( grunts )

388
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:22,333
- HELLO.

389
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:23,791
- HUH?

390
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:25,791
TENCHI, HELLO!

391
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:29,208
( giggles )

392
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:30,708
- OH, TENCHI.

393
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:33,041
YOU'RE RISKING YOUR LIFE
TO SAVE ME.

394
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,125
HOW WONDERFUL YOU ARE.

395
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:36,833
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

396
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:39,666
HE'S COME TO SAVE ME,
YOU IDIOT PRINCESS.

397
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,916
- ( chuckles )

398
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,625
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU BOTH,

399
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:47,500
BUT... HOW DO YOU
OPEN THIS THING? 

400
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,000
- ( both grunting )

401
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:54,250
- WELL THAT'S CERTAINLY
NOT GONNA GET US ANYWHERE.

402
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,041
WE NEED MORE
DRASTIC MEASURES.

403
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:57,875
RYO-OHKI.
- ( meows )

404
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,166
- THAT'S TOO DRASTIC,
WASHU!

405
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,916
- COME ON.
LET'S GET INSIDE NOW.

406
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,083
- ( meows )

407
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,291
- POWER UP ALL GUN PORTS.

408
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:17,625
WE CAN'T LET THEM ESCAPE!

409
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:23,333
- ( all scream )

410
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:25,791
- RYO-OHKI, LET'S GET
OUT OF HERE. TOP SPEED!

411
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,083
- ( meows )

412
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:40,791
- OH BOY. I REALLY HOPE
THEY MAKE IT, KIYONE.

413
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:43,125
- YEAH.

414
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,708
I WONDER WHAT'S HAPPENING
ON PLANET JURAI.

415
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:49,125
- THIS IS REALLY GREAT.

416
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:51,791
LOOK, THE EARTH IS JUST
A TINY SPECK NOW.

417
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:52,958
- OH MAN.
NO KIDDING.

418
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:54,958
HOW AM I GONNA GET 
TO SCHOOL TOMORROW?

419
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:58,000
- HOW AM I GONNA
GET TO WORK?

420
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:59,666
- COME ON, YOU TWO.

421
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,000
JUST HAVE TO GO
WITH THE FLOW. 

422
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:02,833
- I GUESS SO.

423
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:04,125
MMM.

424
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:06,000
IT'S A GOOD THING
I BROUGHT OUR HOUSE WITH ME.

425
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:07,458
- UH...

426
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,458
BUT I AM A ROYAL PRINCESS.

427
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:11,833
WHY MUST I HAVE
ALL THESE TROUBLES?

428
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:13,250
( sighs )

429
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:15,208
- AYEKA,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

430
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,083
- BYE-BYE, EARTH.
BYE-BYE.

TO GALAXY POLICE HEADQUARTERS

455
00:23:26,166 --> 00:23:28,083
ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT
THE ENEMY HAS ALREADY

456
00:23:28,166 --> 00:23:29,541
INFILTRATED THE STATION.

457
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:31,791
NOW WE'RE THE MOST WANTED 
CRIMINALS IN THE UNIVERSE.

458
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:32,916
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO US NEXT?

00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,250
- I'M A WANTED CRIMINAL NOW?

460
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:36,833

WE'LL HAVE FUN TOGETHER.

00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:38,958
WE CRIMINALS ARE LIKE
BROTHERS, YOU KNOW?

WHAT'S GONE WRONG WITH MY LIFE?

- COMING NEXT IS
"NO NEED FOR ESCAPE."
