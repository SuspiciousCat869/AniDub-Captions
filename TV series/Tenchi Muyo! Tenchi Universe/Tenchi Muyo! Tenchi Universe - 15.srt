00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:08,291
- WE'VE COME TO ARREST YOU,
YOUR HIGHNESS.

30
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:10,166
- TO ARREST ME?

31
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,375
- All: HUH?

32
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:14,500
- HUH?
( chuckles )

33
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:16,208
YOU'RE JOKING.
ARREST ME.

34
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:17,375
ON WHAT CHARGES?

35
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:20,000
- YOU ARE CHARGED 
WITH HIGH TREASON.

36
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:24,666
- TENCHI, HELLO!

37
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,666

41
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:39,041
- RYO-OHKI, LET'S GET
OUT OF HERE. TOP SPEED!

42
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,333
- ( meows )

43
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:47,083
- YO!

44
00:02:57,083 --> 00:03:00,250
- DO YOU THINK THAT
THEY ESCAPED SUCCESSFULLY?

45
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:02,416
- I SURE HOPE THEY DID.

46
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,833
BUT THEY HAD TO DEAL
WITH JURAI'S MILITARY.

47
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:07,291
- YES, I KNOW.

48
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:10,166
BUT I SURE DO WONDER WHAT
HAPPENED ON THE PLANET JURAI

49
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,958
WHILE WE WERE ON EARTH,
DON'T YOU?

50
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:13,291
- YES.

51
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:16,750
BUT WE MAY BE ABLE
TO FIND OUT AT HEADQUARTERS.

52
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:37,083
- WE'VE BEEN AWAY
A LONG TIME.

53
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:39,000
- UH-HUH.

54
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:41,333
BUT I'M BACK AGAIN FINALLY.

55
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,875
- WOW. HEADQUARTERS
IS SO FULL OF LIFE,

56
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:48,791
ISN'T IT, KIYONE?

57
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:51,000
- MM-HMM.
MAKES ME FEEL ENERGETIC.

58
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:54,000
WELL, I'LL GO PAY A VISIT
TO DETECTIVE SERGEANT.

59
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:55,208
BYE NOW.

60
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,958
WHY DON'T YOU GET
A BITE AT THE CAFETERIA?

61
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:00,875
- OKAY.

62
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,791
- KIYONE? KIYONE?!

63
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,083
IS THAT REALLY YOU?

64
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:13,458
- HUH?

65
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:16,750
MITSUKI?
- LONG TIME NO SEE.

66
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,541
I HEARD THAT YOU 
WERE COMING BACK.

67
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,166
DID YOU JUST GET HERE?

68
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,666
- YEAH.
JUST A MOMENT AGO.

69
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,833
- YOU'RE LOOKING GOOD.
I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU BACK HERE.

70
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:25,250
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

71
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,000
- I'M GLAD YOU'RE BACK
AT HEADQUARTERS.

72
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:28,833
I REALLY TRULY AM.

73
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:31,375
SINCE YOU WERE DEMOTED
TO SUCH A REMOTE AREA,

74
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:33,916
WELL, WE ALL THOUGHT THAT
WAS THE END OF YOUR CAREER.

75
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,458
- OH, REALLY?

76
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:39,458
- SAY, KIYONE,
DO YOU REMEMBER NUWASE?

77
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:41,166
- SURE, I REMEMBER HER.

78
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,375
- SHE'S NOW CHIEF OF THE PUBLIC
SAFETY DIVISION, YOU KNOW.

79
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:45,375
- ( gasps )
- REMEMBER HACHI?

80
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:47,500
SHE'S THE MARTIAL OF
THE SERIOUS BRANCH. 

81
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:49,041
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

82
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:51,583
- EVERYBODY'S FAIRLY
HIGH UP THERE, AREN'T THEY?

83
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,500
- WELL, YOU COULD SAY THAT.

84
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:57,333
OH, AND I'M IN THE SPECIAL
INVESTIGATION UNIT NOW.

85
00:04:57,416 --> 00:05:00,333
- SPECIAL INVESTIGATION UNIT?
WOW, GREAT.

86
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:03,083
- ( chuckles ) IT'S MERELY
A STEPPING STONE FOR ME.

87
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:05,541
WHICH SECTION ARE YOU
ASSIGNED TO, KIYONE, HEY?

88
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:07,166
- INVESTIGATION UNIT NINE.

89
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,708
- UNIT NINE?

90
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:12,083
OH, THE ONE DEALING WITH
MINOR INCIDENTAL UNIT JOBS, HUH?

91
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,083
GOOD FOR YOU, KID.

92
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:16,375
YOU'LL HAVE A LOT OF TIME
TO KICK BACK AND RELAX.

93
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:17,666
I'D BETTER BE GOING.

94
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:22,958
KIYONE?
I'LL SEE YOU AROUND.

95
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:25,958
- ( mumbles, shouts )

96
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:29,083
WHY THAT NASTY AWFUL LOUSY--

97
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,875
EXCUSE ME, SIR?

98
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:40,541
DETECTIVE FIRST CLASS KIYONE
REPORTING FOR DUTY

99
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:43,583
TO THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION
UNIT NINE AT HEADQUARTERS

100
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,208
AS OF TODAY.

101
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,916
- WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR
YOUR ARRIVAL, DETECTIVE.

102
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,291
- HM?

103
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,916
- I'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT YOU

104
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,250
SINCE YOU WERE IN
THE POLICE ACADEMY.

105
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:58,583
I ALWAYS THOUGHT YOU WERE TOO
GOOD TO BE A RESIDENT OFFICER

106
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,000
IN A REMOTE REGION.

107
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:01,250
- THANKS VERY MUCH, SIR.

108
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,666
- NOW THAT YOU ARE HERE,

109
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,000
I EXPECT TO SEE YOU PERFORM
UP TO YOUR ABILITY.

110
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:07,583
- YES, SIR.

111
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,458
- KIYONE,

112
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:11,541
IT HAS COME TO MY ATTENTION

113
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:13,000
THAT YOU WERE WITH
PRINCESS AYEKA

114
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:15,208
OF THE PLANET JURAI
WHILE YOU WERE ON EARTH?

115
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:18,208
- YES. BY A STRANGE
TURN OF EVENTS.

116
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:19,750
I THOUGHT I'D ALREADY
EXPLAINED ALL THAT

117
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:20,875
IN MY REPORT, SIR.

118
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,583
- YES, YOU DID.

119
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:25,583
DETECTIVE, RIGHT NOW
THE GALAXY POLICE

120
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:27,375
ARE SEARCHING FOR
PRINCESS AYEKA.

121
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:30,666
I THOUGHT YOU MAY HAVE
SOME IDEA AS TO HER WHEREABOUTS.

122
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:36,625
- THE MAN OVER THERE
MUST BE FROM JURAI'S EMBASSY.

123
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:39,166
OR THE INTELLIGENCE BUREAU.

124
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:45,500
- KIYONE,
YOU'RE EVERYTHING THEY SAY.

125
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:51,625
- ( slurps )

126
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:52,958
MMM!

127
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:55,125
- WE INTERRUPT OUR
REGULAR PROGRAMS

128
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:56,625
FOR AN EMERGENCY BROADCAST

129
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,458
REGARDING BREAKING NEWS
FROM THE PLANET JURAI. 

130
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:01,291
AS WE HAVE ALREADY
INFORMED YOU,

131
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:04,250
THE PLANET JURAI
NOW HAS A NEW EMPEROR,

132
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:07,416
OFFICIALLY APPROVED
BY THE PLANETARY COUNCIL.

133
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,083
- A NEW EMPEROR?

134
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:10,875
THIS CANNOT BE HAPPENING.

135
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:12,083
I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS.

136
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:14,166
- SHUT UP, AYEKA.
WE CAN'T HEAR THE NEWS.

137
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,833
- AYEKA, PLEASE BE QUIET.

138
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:18,291
- THE THRONE HAS BEEN
TEMPORARILY VACANT

139
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:20,625
PENDING MARRIAGE BY
THE PRINCESS AYEKA.

140
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:23,291
ON PLANET JURAI THERE
HAS BEEN SOME CONFUSION

141
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:26,875
SINCE THE SUDDEN ASCENDANCE
OF THE NEW EMPEROR YOSHO

142
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:27,916
TO THE THRONE.

143
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,166
- ( gasps )
- BUT JURAI'S GOVERNMENT

144
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,833
 ANNOUNCES THAT EVERYTHING
IS UNDER CONTROL.

145
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,666
- YOSHO?

146
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:37,625
HOW COULD IT BE? 
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE.

147
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,083
- YOSHO?

148
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:42,083
- YES, THAT'S THE NAME OF
JURAI'S NEW EMPEROR.

149
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:43,333
- DETECTIVE SERGEANT,

150
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:45,083
I DON'T REMEMBER HAVING
SEEN THAT NAME

151
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:47,000
AMONG THE SUCCESSORS
TO THE THRONE.

152
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:49,333
- HMM.

153
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:50,333
KIYONE!

154
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:51,958
- THAT'S QUITE ALL RIGHT.

155
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:56,125
YOU MAY NOT HAVE
HEARD OF HIM,

156
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:58,583
BUT YOSHO IS THE
LEGITIMATE SUCCESSOR

157
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,125
TO JURAI'S ROYAL FAMILY,

158
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:02,583
AND A LEGENDARY WARRIOR.

159
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:06,208
HE CAME BACK
TO THE PLANET JURAI.

160
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:09,708
- I JUST CANNOT
BELIEVE ANY OF THIS.

161
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:11,916
- AYEKA.

162
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,541
- OH, THE LEGENDARY WARRIOR
YOSHO.

163
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,541
I HAVE HEARD THAT NAME
SO VERY MANY TIMES

164
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,666
SINCE MY CHILDHOOD
ON PLANET JURAI.

165
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,208
- THE LEGENDARY WARRIOR?

166
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:23,666
WHO IS HE ANYWAY?

167
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,875
- HE IS SAID TO BE THE BEST
SWORDSMAN IN THE EMPIRE.

168
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:28,708
AND HE IS A NOBLE PRINCE

169
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:31,291
GIFTED WITH BOTH
INTELLIGENCE AND COURAGE.

170
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:34,583
BUT HE GAVE UP HIS POSITION
AS THE SUCCESSOR

171
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:36,291
AND JUST DISAPPEARED.

172
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,958
THAT WAS MANY DECADES AGO.

173
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:46,291
WHY...

174
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:48,500
WHY WOULD HE SUDDENLY
COME FORWARD?

175
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:50,625
- I'LL TELL YOU.
HE'S PROBABLY A FAKE.

176
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:53,291
IT'S AN OLD TRICK
USED BY A CONMAN.

177
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:55,291
- CAN'T BE.

178
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,583
AT LEAST HE IS
A ROYAL FAMILY MEMBER.

179
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:59,583
OF THAT,
WE CAN ALL BE SURE.

180
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,166
- WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

181
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,166
- BECAUSE OF JURAI'S POWER.

182
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,625
- THE POWER.

183
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:07,958
IT'S BECAUSE OF THE POWER

184
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:10,625
ONLY JURAI'S ROYAL
FAMILY MEMBERS POSSESS.

185
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:12,791
JURAI'S POWER IS SAID

186
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:15,291
TO EVEN SURPASS
THE POWER OF GOD.

187
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:18,333
WITHOUT A DEMONSTRATION
OF THIS AWESOME POWER, 

188
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:22,000
THE COUNCIL WOULDN'T HAVE 
APPROVED THE ENTHRONEMENT.

189
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:28,625
BESIDES, I SAW IT
WITH MY OWN EYES.

190
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:33,083
I WITNESSED HOW POWERFUL
YOSHO IS.

191
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:37,791
- DISSATISFIED WITH
THE ENTHRONEMENT OF YOSHO,

192
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,666
PRINCESS AYEKA
ATTEMPTED A COUP

193
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,291
AND IS NOW CONSIDERED 
A FUGITIVE ON THE RUN.

194
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:43,333
- ( spits )

195
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,208
- COUP DE TAT?  ME?!
ARE THEY CRAZY?

196
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:48,750
- YOU ARE SO BAD,
AYEKA, YOU KNOW? 

197
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:50,083
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT

198
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:52,125
JUST BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T
MAKE IT TO THE THRONE. 

199
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:53,666
- OH, RYOKO!

200
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,125
- ( chuckles )
HEY, COME ON, AYEKA.

201
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:57,500
THAT'S WHAT IT SAID ON TV.

202
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:58,791
WHAT?!

203
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,375
- THIS IS A PICTURE OF THE
SPACE PIRATE RYOKO,

204
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,500
WHO IS ACTING TOGETHER
WITH PRINCESS AYEKA.

205
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:04,375
RYOKO HAS BEEN
A MOST WANTED CRIMINAL

206
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:05,791
FOR QUITE SOME TIME NOW.

207
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:07,458
AND IT IS BELIEVED
SHE PLAYED A MAJOR PART

208
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,458
IN THE ATTEMPTED COUP.

209
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:10,791
- ( groans )

210
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:13,041
WHY WOULD I WANT TO HELP
AYEKA WITH HER CONSPIRACY,

211
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,500
STUPID NEWS GUY?

212
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:16,333
- LOOK. JUST BY STANDING
NEXT TO YOU,

213
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,833
EVEN I LOOK LIKE
A CRIMINAL.

214
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:20,125
- LISTEN, YOU.

215
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:21,500
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S
GETTING ME INTO TROUBLE.

216
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:22,583
( grunts )

217
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,500
- PRINCESS SASAMI AND OTHERS

218
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,500
THAT WERE INVOLVED
IN THIS ATTEMPTED COUP

219
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,791
ARE STILL AT LARGE
WITH THE PRINCESS AYEKA.

220
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:31,250
AND THE POLICE ARE DOING
EVERYTHING THEY CAN

221
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:32,708
TO APPREHEND THEM.

222
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:34,708
- I'D BETTER TELL KIYONE
ABOUT THE NEWS.

223
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:36,708
( slurps )

224
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:37,875
AHH.

225
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,541
- YO!

226
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:57,791
- AYEKA,

227
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:00,125
YOU ARE BEING FRAMED.

228
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:03,333
- I ASK YOU AGAIN,
WHERE IS PRINCESS AYEKA?

229
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:05,041
YOU MUST TELL ME,
KIYONE.

230
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:06,750
- I DON'T KNOW, SIR.

231
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:09,916
- I SEE.

232
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,125
- ( elevator dings )

233
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:24,375
- I MUST ACT WITH 
GREAT CAUTION NOW.

234
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,750
- SHE HONESTLY DIDN'T KNOW,
DID SHE?

235
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,750
- SHE DIDN'T.

236
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:37,541
BUT IT WOULD BE WISE OF US

237
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:40,708
TO KEEP OUR EYES
ON HER FOR AWHILE.

238
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:43,125
- I AGREE.

239
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,041
- MIHOSHI.

240
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:55,458
- PLEASE DON'T FORGET
OUR REQUEST.

241
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:56,916
- DON'T WORRY.

242
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,125
AS SOON AS AYEKA
FALLS INTO OUR TRAP,

243
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:00,708
WE'LL HAND HER OVER TO YOU.

244
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:03,500
WE'D LIKE TO STAY ON GOOD
TERMS WITH THE PLANET JURAI,

245
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:04,833
YOU KNOW.

246
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:06,916
- YOSHO EXPECTS TO HEAR
GOOD NEWS FROM YOU.

247
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,666
REMEMBER THAT, WON'T YOU?

248
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,208
- ( laughs )
- WHA--?! WHO ARE YOU?

249
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:12,625
- HUH?

250
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,291
- HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN HERE?

251
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:17,125
- WELL, I CAME TO
LOOK FOR KIYONE, 

252
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:20,125
BUT I CAN SEE THAT
SHE'S NOT HERE.

253
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:21,291
( chuckles )

254
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,291
- WHERE COULD MIHOSHI BE?

255
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:26,208
PROBABLY WANDERING AROUND
SOMEWHERE.

256
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:28,375
- DID YOU HEAR
OUR CONVERSATION?

257
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:30,583
- OH, NO. NO.
DIDN'T HEAR YOU.

258
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,833
DIDN'T HEAR YOU 
TALK ABOUT YOSHO

259
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:34,375
OR ANYTHING
ABOUT AYEKA EITHER.

260
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:35,791
I DIDN'T HEAR A THING,
REALLY.

261
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:36,916
SO I THINK
I SHOULD BE GOING,

262
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,166
I'M GOING TO BE
ON MY WAY.

263
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,333
SORRY TO BOTHER YOU.
OKAY, BYE.

264
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:42,375
SO LONG.

265
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:48,333
- WHO-- WHO WAS THAT WOMAN?

266
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:49,666
- I THINK SHE IS...

267
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:53,083
THAT'S RIGHT.

268
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:54,666
SHE'S DETECTIVE MIHOSHI.

269
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,500
SHE IS KIYONE'S PARTNER.

270
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:58,958
- SHE IS?
CAPTURE HER NOW.

271
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:00,000
- RIGHT AWAY, SIR.

272
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,875
WE HAVE AN EMERGENCY.

273
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:03,333
- ( alarm rings )
- HUH?

274
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:04,333
WHAT'S GOING ON?

275
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,958
( gasps )

276
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:27,041
HUH?

277
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:29,375
HUH?

278
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:34,875
- KIYONE.
- HUH?

279
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:36,708
- YOU ARE COMPLETELY
SURROUNDED.

280
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:39,541
PUT DOWN YOUR WEAPON
AND SURRENDER RIGHT NOW.

281
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:42,708
MITSUKI,
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

282
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:45,666
- YOU ARE UNDER ARREST,
DETECTIVE KIYONE.

283
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,375
- ARREST?!
YOU'RE JOKING, RIGHT?

284
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:52,208
- I'M SORRY,
BUT THIS IS NOT A JOKE.

285
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:53,708
PLEASE DON'T MOVE.

286
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,375
I'VE BEEN ORDERED TO SHOOT YOU
IF YOU RESIST IN ANY WAY.

287
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:57,666
- YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR MIND!

288
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,958
- WHAT CAN I SAY?
I HAVE MY ORDERS.

289
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,583
AS YOU CAN SEE,
THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN ESCAPE.

290
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:08,291
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU DID TO DESERVE THIS,

291
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:11,375
BUT YOU MUST HAVE
BEEN DESPERATE.

292
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,250
YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD
HAVE COME TO ME

293
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,041
IF YOU HAD TROUBLES,
KIYONE.

294
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,916
UNLESS THEY'RE FINANCIAL.

295
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,083
FREEZE, KIYONE!

296
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:22,750
DIDN'T I TELL YOU
NOT TO MOVE?

297
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:25,458
PLEASE PUT DOWN YOUR
WEAPONS IMMEDIATELY.

298
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:32,541
YOU MUST HAVE SOME MORE.

299
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,000
- ( sighs )

300
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:40,916
- THIS IS RATHER DRAMATIC,
ISN'T IT?

301
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,750
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
IT TURNS OUT

302
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:45,458
I'M ARRESTING A CLASSMATE.

303
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:48,125
DON'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY.

304
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:49,833
THIS ISN'T EASY
FOR ME, YOU KNOW.

305
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:53,333
- AAH!

306
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:54,750
- KIYONE!

307
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:56,041
GET ON, QUICKLY!

308
00:14:58,750 --> 00:14:59,666
- AAH!

309
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,083
AAH!

310
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,500
( grunts )

311
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,500
( grunts )

312
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:16,750
- I OWE YOU ONE,
MIHOSHI.

313
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,083
THANK YOU.

314
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:19,666
- BUT WE'RE NOT
HOME FREE YET. 

315
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:30,875
- ( grunts )

316
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:48,333
- YOU HAVE AN UNCANNY WAY
OF ATTRACTING TROUBLE.

317
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:49,916
- I THOUGHT THIS WAS
ALL YOUR DOING.

318
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,041
BESIDES, YOU'RE THE ONE

319
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:53,500
THE POLICE HAVE BEEN
AFTER FOR SO LONG.

320
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:54,833
- OH, YEAH?

321
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,375
AND WHO'S THE ONE
EVERY ARMY ON JURAI

322
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:57,666
IS LOOKING FOR, HUH?

323
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,125
NICE GOING,
LITTLE MISS TRAITOR.

324
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:01,916
- ARE YOU CALLING ME
A TRAITOR?!

325
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,250
- STOP, BOTH OF YOU!

326
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:04,750
THIS IS NO TIME
TO BE ARGUING. 

327
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,041
- HMM.

328
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:08,541
WELL, WE'RE NOW WANTED
CRIMINALS EVERYWHERE. 

329
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:10,291
THERE'S NO PLACE
FOR US TO HIDE

330
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,166
ANYWHERE IN THIS UNIVERSE.

331
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:15,291
- YEAH. WHAT ARE WE 
GONNA DO NOW, WASHU?

332
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,125
- HMM.

333
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:20,875
- I GUESS WE'LL JUST
HAVE TO GO TO JURAI.

334
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,041
- All: HUH?!

335
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:23,500
- GRANDPA...

336
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,166
- I DON'T KNOW WHO YOSHO IS,

337
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,708
BUT I SUSPECT THAT--

338
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:28,708
NO, I MUST SAY

339
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:30,708
I REALLY CAN'T THINK
OF ANY OTHER WAY

340
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:32,083
TO STRAIGHTEN THINGS OUT

341
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:33,541
AND TO PROVE
OUR INNOCENCE.

342
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:34,583
RIGHT, AYEKA?

343
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:39,083
- YES.

344
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,000
- ( Ryo-Ohki meows )

345
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:47,041
- WHAT'S THE MATTER,
RYO-OHKI?

346
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,041
- HUH?
- OH.

347
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:49,041
- YEAH, THAT'S GREAT.

348
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:50,375
- THE GALAXY POLICE.

349
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:55,833
- THIS IS ALL BECAUSE
OF YOU, MIHOSHI!

350
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:58,541
- HEY, KIYONE, I CAME
TO RESCUE YOU, DIDN'T I?

351
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,500
WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT?
COME ON, EASY DOES IT.

352
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:02,250
- I DON'T GET YOU!

353
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:03,750
- ( monitor beeps )

354
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:04,750
- HUH?

355
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:06,666
- ATTENTION ALL
PATROLLING SHIPS,

356
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,416
ATTENTION ALL
PATROLLING SHIPS,

357
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,000
WE'VE SPOTTED
THE SUSPECT AYEKA

358
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,916
AND HER GROUP IN 
SPACE ZONE 2-4-7.

359
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,125
PROCEED TO THE SCENE AT ONCE.

360
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:16,125
REPEAT, WE'VE SPOTTED
THE SUSPECT AYEKA

361
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:18,041
AND HER GROUP IN 
SPACE ZONE 2-4-7.

362
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:21,958
- Both: WHOA!

363
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,833
- ( all scream )

364
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:39,958
- ( meows )

365
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:45,291
- OH, NO.  RYO-OHKI'S
RUNNING OUT OF POWER.

366
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:46,291
- WHAT?!

367
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:48,500
- YOU CAN DO IT.
COME ON, RYO-OHKI.

368
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,666
- ( meows )

369
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:58,250
- WE'RE TOTALLY SURROUNDED.

370
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:00,708
THERE'S NO WAY OUT.
NO WAY.

371
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:02,125
- NO WAY OUT?

372
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:04,375
- WHAT ARE WE
GONNA DO NOW?

373
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,833
- WE DON'T SEEM TO HAVE
MUCH OF A CHOICE.

374
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:07,833
- HMM.

375
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,208
- WILL WE COLLIDE?

376
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:24,333
- YES.

377
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:25,708
WE WILL COLLIDE.

378
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,916
- UH!
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT WAS.

379
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:41,916
- HEY, LOOK.
IT'S YAGAMI.

380
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:45,833
- HMM?
- ( both laugh )

381
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,958
- HERE COME SOME MORE.
- HUH?

382
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:50,208
- THEY ARE SO PERSISTENT.

383
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:52,791
- WE'RE GONNA FIRE
ANOTHER ONE.

384
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:08,375
- YOU SHOULD TAKE
THIS OPPORTUNITY.

385
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:09,833
- THANKS, YOU GUYS.

386
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:39,416
- AS YOU MAY ALREADY KNOW,

387
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:44,250
WE HAVE CAPTURED MOST OF THE
MAIN CLAIMANTS TO THE THRONE.

388
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:46,083
BUT EVERYTHING WILL
BE IN VAIN

389
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:48,291
UNLESS WE CAPTURE
PRINCESS AYEKA.

390
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:50,416
SHE IS FIRST IN LINE
TO THE THRONE.

391
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,083
LISTEN UP,
WE CANNOT FAIL IN THIS MISSION.

392
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,625
THIS IS A SUPREME ORDER
FROM EMPEROR YOSHO.

393
00:19:57,708 --> 00:20:02,000
LONG LIVE THE NEW EMPEROR
OF THE PLANET JURAI!

394
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:18,583
- THERE ARE TWO NEW MEMBERS
INVOLVED IN THE COUP

395
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:19,750
WITH PRINCESS AYEKA.

396
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:21,791
THEY ARE DETECTIVES
FIRST CLASS KIYONE,

397
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:23,125
AND MIHOSHI.

398
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,708
THEY ARE BOTH IN
ACTIVE SERVICE. 

399
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,083
THEY HAVE ESCAPED FROM
GALAXY POLICE HEADQUARTERS.

400
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:30,333
IT IS THOUGHT THEY DID SO
IN ORDER TO JOIN

401
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:31,750
THE REST OF THEIR GROUP.

402
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:33,458
THE GALAXY POLICE
ARE EMBARRASSED

403
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:36,666
BY THE TWO ACTIVE MEMBERS'
CONDUCT.

404
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,333
- I LOSE MY PROMOTION,

405
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:41,125
AND I ALSO HAVE TO
BE ON THE RUN.

406
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,000
I'M...

407
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:45,958
THE MOST WANTED CRIMINAL
IN THE UNIVERSE.

408
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:47,791
- CHEER UP, KIYONE.

409
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:49,291
SOON WE CAN ALL BE
TOGETHER AGAIN.

410
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:50,958
YOU'LL SEE.

411
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:54,250
EVERYTHING WILL WORK OUT
ONCE WE GET TO THE PLANET JURAI.

412
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:59,291
- MIHOSHI, YOU REALLY ARE
MY BAD LUCK CHARM.

413
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:01,458
- HI, KIYONE AND MIHOSHI.
- HUH?

414
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:03,375
- WE'RE SORRY TO
TROUBLE YOU LIKE THIS.

415
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:06,458
- WILL YOU PLEASE ESCORT US
TO THE PLANET JURAI NOW?

416
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:09,416
- RYO-OHKI,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

417
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,583
- ( meows )

418
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:14,166
- OKAY. WE'RE GONNA
CROSS THE GALAXY

419
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,791
ALL THE WAY TO
PLANET JURAI. 

420
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:18,833
- RYOKO, YOU'VE GOT SOME NERVE
DRINKING AT A TIME LIKE THIS. 

421
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:20,458
- I SEE THE "NO SMOKING" SIGN,

422
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:22,791
BUT I DON'T SEE
A "NO DRINKING" SIGN ANYWHERE.

423
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:24,333
- YOU'RE JUST A DRUNKARD.

424
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:25,666
- WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

425
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,916
HEY, SHUT UP!

426
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,791
- COME ON NOW. LET'S TRY
TO GET ALONG, SHALL WE? 

427
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:33,750
- MY LIFE'S A MESS.

453
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:29,916
CAN BE BLINDED SOMETIMES.

454
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,500
MARKED BY CONSPIRACY 
AS A WANTED CRIMINAL,

455
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:35,500
PRINCESS AYEKA HEADS HOME
FOR PLANET JURAI.

456
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:37,625
WHILE ON THE RUN,
SHE HAS TO DISGUISE HERSELF

457
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:38,958
AS A BAR OWNER

458
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:42,833
SCAMMING CUSTOMERS
TO SURVIVE DAY BY DAY.

459
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:45,833
- COMING UP NEXT IS
"NO NEED FOR HIDING."

460
00:23:45,916 --> 00:23:49,000
GEE, I REALLY WONDER IF 
WE SHOULD BE DOING THIS.

461
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:52,541
- IT'S UNQUESTIONABLY SEXY.
