122
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:02,208

124

RYOKO CAN GO THROUGH WALLS

125
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:09,583
- YOU MEAN LIKE ME?

126
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:12,208
- IS THAT BECAUSE YOU HAVE
E.S.P. OR SOMETHING?

127
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,875
- I DON'T KNOW.

128
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:17,375
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN ALONE SO I
DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW I DO IT.

129
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:22,791
THE ONLY CLUE I HAVE LEFT
IS THAT PHOTOGRAPH.

130
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:25,083
- THAT PHOTO OVER THERE?

131
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:28,541

IT'S SO PRETTY.

133
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:38,083

TO TRY IT ON, SASAMI?

140
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:12,500

YOU A TOUR OF THE SHIP.

141
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:13,625

- SO, WASHU, WHAT DO YOU THINK?
CAN YOU FIGURE ANY OF THIS OUT?

144
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:38,875
- WELL, CONSIDERING
THE SIZE OF THAT SHIP,

145
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:42,041
IT SHOULD HAVE JUST ABOUT
THE SAME POWER AS YAGAMI DOES.

146
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:44,958
BUT I CAN'T SEE
ANY TRACE OF IT.

147
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:46,708
- YEAH, AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

148
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:50,458
- NO ENERGY. THE SHIP
DOESN'T HAVE ANY OUTPUT.

149
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:53,250
IN OTHER WORDS,
THAT SHIP IS DEAD.

150

153
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,916

157
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:46,250
THAT NOISE-- I'M SCARED!

158
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:48,750
- I DON'T HEAR ANYTHING!

159
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:52,833
- LET'S GO BACK PLEASE!
- WE JUST GOT HERE, MIHOSHI!

160
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:56,791
- THIS MUST BE A GHOST SHIP.
WHAT ELSE COULD IT BE?

161
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:59,833
- YOU'RE IMAGINING THINGS!
NOW STOP!

162
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:04,666
- ( sobs )
WAIT FOR ME!

163
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,916
- ( crackling )

164
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,708
- Washu: OH, THE LEVEL
OF IONS IN THE AIR

165
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,041
IS INCREASING CONSIDERABLY.

166
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:20,000
THIS IS EXCITING TO GATHER
SUCH VALUABLE DATA, TENCHI.

167
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:22,750
I WONDER IF IT'S BECAUSE
THE MATERIALIZED ECTOPLASM

168
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:24,291
IS ETHEREAL IN NATURE?

169
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:26,333
- WASHU, WE'RE LOOKING FOR
SASAMI, AREN'T WE?

170
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,291
FIRST THINGS FIRST,
OKAY, PLEASE?

171
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:32,250
- Both: YUP!

172
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:33,958
- ( drums playing )

173
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,125
- YUP!

174
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:51,333
- HEY, THAT'S MY SISTER!
- OH, WHICH ONE?

175
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:53,750
- THAT ONE,
WITH THE LONG HAIR.

176
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:58,000
- I CAN'T SEE. CAN YOU FIND
A SWITCH ANYWHERE, RYOKO?

177
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:00,291
IT'S REALLY SO DARK IN HERE
AND WE NEED SOME LIGHT.

178
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:03,833
HUH?!

179
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:10,000
( screams )
- HUH? HEY!

180
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:13,291
WHAT IS IT, AYEKA?
- UH UH UH.

181
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:14,333
- HUH?

182
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:20,500
- OH, SASAMI.
- ( gasps )

183
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,541
- ( both laughing )

184
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,458
- IT SEEMS LIKE
A REGULAR MIRROR TO ME.

185
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:33,000
- BUT I JUST SAW SASAMI'S
REFLECTION IN THERE.

186
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:35,625
- AYEKA, I REALLY THINK
YOU'RE SEEING THINGS.

187
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:37,541
- SASA-- OH!

188
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:40,666
SASAMI? SASAMI?

189
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,958
- STOP BANGING YOUR
HEAD LIKE THAT.

190
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,625
- YOUR FACE IS GONNA WARP.
- SASAMI.

191
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,666
- YEAH!

192
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,000
OH, THAT WAS SO CLOSE.

193
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:54,041
- BUT IT SURE WAS
FUN THOUGH, WASN'T IT?

194
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:56,041
- ( giggling )

195
00:12:57,458 --> 00:13:00,416
- MIREI, HEY, LET'S TRICK THEM
A LITTLE BIT MORE.

196
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:04,083
WHAT DO YOU THINK, HUH?
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN "TRICK THEM"?

197
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:05,916
- MEOW?

198
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,250
- Mirei: HERE THEY COME.

199
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:26,041
- WHAT'S THIS PLACE?

200
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:28,375
- LOOKS LIKE A BALLROOM,
DOESN'T IT?

201
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:34,583
- ( whimpering )

202
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:37,875
- ( gasps ) OH.

203
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:40,708
OH, IT'S JUST A MIRROR.
- Sasami: BOO!

204
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:43,750
- ( stammers )
- ( screams )

205
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:46,375
- Girls: WAHOOO-OOO!

206
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:49,666
HUH?

207
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,083
- ( both groan )

208
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:05,458
- SASAMI!
- ( crackling )

209
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,541
- SASAMI, WHERE ARE YOU?

210
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,291
- HUH?

211
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:16,250
- HUH?
WASHU, LOOK!

212
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,500
- WHAT? WHOA!

213
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:19,958
- ( crackling )

214
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,875
- OH, HUH.
- ( Tenchi groaning )

215
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:31,958
- WOW, THAT MUST BE
AN ETHEREAL LIFEFORM.

216
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:35,458
THAT'S AMAZING!
I WONDER IF IT'S EVEN POSSIBLE

217
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,416
TO COLLECT A SAMPLE.
- WASHU, FORGET ABOUT THAT.

218
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,666
WE HAVE TO FIND SASAMI.

219
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,083
- WHY DIDN'T YOU GRAB
THAT THING FOR ME, TENCHI?

220
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:45,000
- OH MAN.

221
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,458
- ( giggling )

222
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:50,000
- WOW, THAT WAS A LOT OF FUN.

223
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:52,458
- HEY, WAIT, SASAMI.

224
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,291
CAN YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES
FOR A SECOND?

225
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:56,416
- YEAH.

226
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,375
- ( gasps )

227
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:26,125
IT'S MY GARDEN AT HOME!

228
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,500
- I COULD SEE IT
IN YOUR MIND, SASAMI.

229
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:29,833
IT'S YOUR GARDEN.

230
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:32,833
- HUH? MEOW.

231
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:33,958
MEOW!

232
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:41,208
MEOW!

233
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:46,708
MEOW MEOW!

234
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,375
- LET'S GO THIS WAY.
WE HAVE A MAZE.

235
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:56,083
- MEOW?

236
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:03,000
- HERE.

237
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:07,666
THIS WAS ONE
OF MY FAVORITE PLACES.

238
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:22,208
LOOK, THERE'S THE RIBBON
I TIED AS A SIGNPOST.

239
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:24,041
( laughs )

240
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:26,541
THERE'S A FOUNTAIN
AT THE END OF THIS MAZE.

241
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,833
( gasps ) OH.

242
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:35,416
YOU SHOULDN'T CHEAT LIKE THAT.

243
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,833
- DON'T YOU WANT
TO GET THERE QUICKLY, SASAMI?

244
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:48,958
- Sasami: THIS IS KINDA STRANGE,
ISN'T IT?

245
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,416
- YEAH.

246
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,333
- I USED TO CUT STUDY HALL
AND COME OVER HERE A LOT

247
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:55,583
AND THEY WERE ALWAYS
SO MAD AT ME.

248
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,250
- I ENVY YOU, SASAMI.

249
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,666
SO YOU REALLY ARE
A PRINCESS, HUH?

250
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,875
- IT'S NOT A GOOD THING
TO BE A PRINCESS.

251
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:04,333
YOU HAVE TO BE
SO POLITE AND PROPER.

252
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:07,291
MMM.

253
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:13,375
- CATCH!
- AHHH, THAT'S COLD.

254
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:16,250
- SNEAK ATTACK!
- ( laughing )

255
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,000
- I'M SOAKING WET.
IT'S GREAT.

256
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,333
- YEAH, ME TOO.

257
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:28,000
- HEY, LET'S TAKE
THE ROLLER-COASTER RIDE.

258
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:29,458
THAT SHOULD DRY US.

259
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:34,375
- ( screaming )
- ( meowing )

260
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:41,125
- MEGA ULTRA SUPERLOOP,
ALL RIGHT!

261
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:47,666
- ( laughing )

262
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:54,625
- I'VE BEEN ON THIS ON EARTH.
I LOVE MERRY-GO-ROUNDS.

263
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:57,708
- IN YOUR MIND, THE MEMORY
OF THIS RIDE HAD A STICKER

264
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:59,541
SAYING "TWO THUMBS UP"

265
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:02,333
AND IT HAD SPARKLING
HEARTS ALL OVER IT.

266
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,625
- IT'S THINGS THAT ARE
BEAUTIFUL AND DEAR TO ME.

267
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:11,333
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY
RIGHT, MIREI.

268
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:14,083
ONLY MY FAVORITE MEMORIES
GET ONE OF THOSE STICKERS.

269
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:20,250
WOW, NOW THIS IS HOW
I REMEMBER FIREWORKS.

270
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,458
- DOES THIS HAVE A STICKER TOO?
- YEP.

271
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:24,750
IT'S GOT AN ULTRA
SUPER JUMBO STICKER.

272
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:29,500
- ME-MEOW-OW.

273
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:31,500
- ( gasps ) OHHH.

274
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,958
I THINK I SHOULD GO.

275
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:35,958
- BUT WHY?

276
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:38,916
- 'CAUSE EVERYBODY WILL BE
SO WORRIED ABOUT ME.

277
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,291
( gasps )
WHAT?

278
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:45,958
THEY DISAPPEARED.

279
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,625
- THE THING IS

280
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:55,875
IT ISN'T POSSIBLE FOR THE MIND
TO BE IN TWO PLACES AT ONCE.

281
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,375
- MEOW MEOW?

282
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:06,833
- MIREI, I'M SORRY.

283
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:10,416
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
I HAD A LOT OF FUN, SASAMI.

284
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,833
- MIREI, PROMISE
WE'LL MEET AGAIN.

285
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:16,000
- MM-HMM.

286
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:17,958
- I'LL BE BACK. LET'S LOOK
FORWARD TO THAT.

287
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:19,708
- MM-HMM, ALL RIGHT.

288
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:23,166
- IT AWFUL, BUT I DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO OFFER YOU

289
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,583
AS A TOKEN
OF OUR FRIENDSHIP.

290
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,541
( gasps )

291
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:32,708
- YOU'VE ALREADY
GIVEN ME SOMETHING--

292
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:34,750
YOUR WARM FEELINGS, SASAMI.

293
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:40,875
- MEOW.

294
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:42,791
- BYE-BYE, RYO-OHKI.

295
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,291
LET'S GO NOW.

296
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:52,250
- OH, FAILURE.

297
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:55,750
NEXT TIME WE HAVE
TO GO BETTER PREPARED.

298
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:58,208
- ( crying )
SASAMI!

299
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:08,500
- MIREI!

300
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:13,916
- MEOW?

301
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,375
- I GUESS SHE'S GONE.

302
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:25,291
HI, I'M BACK!

303
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:28,708
- SASAMI!
- SASAMI!

304
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:32,166
- SASAMI, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

305
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:35,166
- IT'S A SECRET, YOU KNOW.

306
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:38,125
- WHAT?

307
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:40,041
- ( all gasp )

308
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:47,458
- ( engine whirring )
- HUH?

309
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:49,583
- WHAT'S HAPPENING?

310
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,375
- WELL, I THINK
THE POWER IS BACK ON

311
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,750
AND YAGAMI CAN FLY.

312
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:05,750
- GOODBYE, MIREI.

313
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:09,000
HUH?

314
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,791
