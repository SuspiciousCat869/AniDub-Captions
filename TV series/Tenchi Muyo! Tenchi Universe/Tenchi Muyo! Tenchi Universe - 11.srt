29
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,166
- YO!

30
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:06,708
- ( women chattering )
- ( meowing )

31
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:13,750

32
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,750
- ( laughter )

33
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:22,250
- THIS BATH HAS SO MUCH ROOM.
IT'S REALLY NICE, ISN'T IT?

34
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:23,541
- YEAH.

35
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:25,125
- ( giggles )

36
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:27,791
WELL, YOU KNOW YOU CAN COME OVER
AND USE IT ANYTIME YOU LIKE.

37
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:29,833
- AND SINCE WHEN IS THIS
YOUR PLACE, PRINCESS?

38
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:30,916
- UGH...

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,916
- WOW, THAT WOULD BE NICE.

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,416
WOULDN'T IT, KIYONE?
- HMM?

41
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,250
- WE'VE ONLY BEEN ABLE TO TAKE
A BATH ONCE EVERY THREE DAYS

42
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:40,583
SINCE THE PUBLIC BATHS
RAISED THEIR PRICES, RIGHT?

43
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:43,625
- ( groans ) I THOUGHT I TOLD
YOU TO KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT?!

44
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:46,625
- IN THAT CASE, YOU CAN COME
HERE EVERY DAY, IF YOU'D LIKE.

45
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,583
- LIKE I SAID, PRINCESS.
THIS ISN'T EVEN YOUR PLACE.

46
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:52,541
- REMEMBER, THIS IS NOT
YOUR PLACE EITHER.

47
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:54,208
- HEY, LET ME IN,
LET ME IN!

48
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:57,250
I WANNA TAKE A BATH
WITH YOU GIRLS!  HEY!

49
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,916
- WHY DON'T YOU JUST
GIVE IT UP, DAD?

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,750
( sighs )

51
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:03,750
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

52
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:05,083
- ( unintelligible speech )

53
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,583
LET'S GET UP HERE.

54
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:17,958
- ( gasps )
HUH?!

55
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:23,250
- AH, WELL,
IT'S YOU, TENCHI.

56
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:27,250
HEY, I'LL WASH YOUR BACK
AND YOU WASH MINE, DEAL?

57
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:31,916
- WOW!  I WANNA WASH
HIS BACK TOO.  ( gasps )

58
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,833
- ( girls scream )

59
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:38,583
- ( inhales deeply )
HUH?

60
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:39,958
THE KITCHEN?

61
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:42,958
- WASHU, WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

62
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:45,625
I THOUGHT THE BATH WAS IN A
DIFFERENT DIMENSION COMPLETELY.

63
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,958
HEY, WASHU!

64
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:49,625
- All: HUH?

65
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:50,916
- HUH?

66
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,458
- All: WHAT?

67
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:58,666
- WHAT THE HECK IS THIS THING?

68
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:02,875
- ( chuckles )

69
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:04,833
( cackles )

70
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,833
- YO!

71
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:17,791
- SO, THE BATHROOM WAS
IN FLUX, HUH?

72
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:20,916
IT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE
OF THE DIMENSION TUNER.

73
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,625
I WAS JUST EXPERIMENTING
ON THAT.

74
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:26,166
- DIMENSION TUNER?

75
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,666
- OVER THERE, YOU SEE?

76
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,333
IT'S A CENTRAL PART
OF MY MACHINE.

77
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:33,208
- All: OHH...

78
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:36,375
- BUT, WHAT DOES
THIS MACHINE DO?

79
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:38,333
IT LOOKS SO HUGE.

80
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:42,125
- CONTROLS DIMENSION AND CAUSE
AND EFFECT. ( chuckles )

81
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:46,458
IT'S JUST MY BEST INVENTION
IN THE PAST 700 YEARS!

82
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:48,750
- RIGHT.  EXPLAIN IT AGAIN.

83
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:51,833
- IT DETERMINES VARIABLE FACTORS
IN TIME AND SPACE

84
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:54,333
BASED ON A CERTAIN CRITERIA.

85
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:57,166
- RIGHT...
NOW, WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

86
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,833
- WITH THIS MACHINE
YOU CAN CREATE A CERTAIN NEXUS

87
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:03,375
FROM THE INFINITE POSSIBILITIES
THAT EXIST IN TIME AND SPACE!

88
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:04,875
UNDERSTAND NOW?

89
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:07,208
- All: NOT AT ALL, NO.

90
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:09,708
- AAH!  AARGH!

91
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:12,375
WHY IS IT SO DIFFICULT
TO UNDERSTAND?!

92
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,666
- ( mockingly ) WHY CAN'T YOU
EXPLAIN IT MORE CLEARLY?!

93
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:18,083
- LISTEN, PEOPLE, ALL RIGHT.
THIS IS WHAT IT DOES...

94
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:20,916
IT CHANGES THE WORLD
TO SUIT YOUR NEEDS!

95
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,583
IS THAT CLEAR ENOUGH FOR YOU?!

96
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:23,875
- All: WHAT?

97
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:27,208
- NO WAY.
- REALLY?

98
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:30,708
- WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY THAT
IN THE FIRST PLACE, WASHU, HUH?

99
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:32,291
- BUT I HAVE BEEN.

100
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,625
- SAY, I HAVE AN IDEA, WASHU.

101
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:37,125
DO YOU THINK I COULD
BORROW THIS MACHINE FOR AWHILE?

102
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:38,750
DO YOU?

103
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:40,250
- NOW, JUST A MINUTE.
- ( grunts )

104
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,416
- COULD YOU PLEASE LEND IT
TO ME, WASHU?

105
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,916
- HOLD ON!
I ASKED YOU FIRST, YOU--

106
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,750
- I HAVE TO USE IT FIRST!

107
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,458
- YOU ARE TOO SLOW.

108
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:50,666
- I TOLD YOU, I GET
TO USE IT FIRST.

109
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,125
- ( clearing throat )
- KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF!

110
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:54,250
- YOU WANNA USE THIS MACHINE
TO GET TENCHI, DON'T YOU?

111
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,750
- I AM NOT THAT SNEAKY!
GET OFF MY BACK!

112
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:59,083
NOW WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?
YOU COME IN HERE AND YOU--

113
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:00,750
- HEY, CUT IT OUT!
 ( clears throat )

114
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,750
FIRST OF ALL,
THIS INVENTION ISN'T FINISHED.

115
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,250
YOU CAN'T USE IT YET.
( huffs )

116
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:05,458
- Both: UH...

117
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,291
- I DON'T CARE
IF IT'S NOT FINISHED.

118
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,083
- AND I JUST WANNA SEE IT WORK.

119
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:10,666
- NO!

120
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,041
- CAN WE USE THIS
MACHINE, PLEASE?

121
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:13,666
- I JUST WANNA TRY IT.
I'M JUST CURIOUS, YOU KNOW?

122
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,583
- I SAID NO!

123
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,916
- I'D REALLY LIKE TO KNOW
HOW I ENDED UP IN THE KITCHEN.

124
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,500
- ( excited chatter )
- WOW, WHAT A MACHINE!

125
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:25,250
- TENCHI, I THINK
WE BETTER GET GOING.

126
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:27,291
- I THANK YOU FOR
HAVING US OVER.

127
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:30,958
- HEY, GIRLS, IT'S AWFULLY
LATE ALREADY, YOU KNOW, HUH?

128
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:32,708
WHY DON'T YOU STAY
OVER HERE TONIGHT?

129
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:34,875
- I DON'T WANNA BE A BURDEN.

130
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:36,833
- REALLY?  WE'D LOVE TO.

131
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:38,166
- HUH? ( growls )

132
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,583
- WE WERE HESITANT TO GO BACK
TO OUR APARTMENT,

133
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,458
BECAUSE WE HADN'T PAID
THE RENT FOR AWHILE, YOU KNOW?

134
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:45,916
- YOU ALWAYS SAY
ONE WORD TOO MANY!

135
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,958
( chuckles softly )

136
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,666
I GUESS WE'LL BE TAKING
YOUR OFFER.

137
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:05,416
- ( snoring )

138
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:19,458
- ( chuckles )

139
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:32,458
WASHU IS NOT HERE, HUH?
( chuckles )

140
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,000
YES, ALL RIGHT.

141
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:40,416
NOW I KNOW I SHOULDN'T LET
THIS USEFUL MACHINE

142
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,916
JUST SIT HERE, SHOULD I?

143
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,250
LET'S SEE, THE WAY TO
TURN THIS ON HAS TO BE... HMM.

144
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:48,916
IS THIS IT?

145
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,916
- ( whirring )

146
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,291
- OH, YES,
I THINK THAT'S IT.

147
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,583
THIS WORLD'S FOR YOU AND ME.

148
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:59,791
- FOR YOU AND WHOM, PRAY TELL?

149
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:03,125
- FOR TENCHI AND I, OF COURSE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK, HUH?

150
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:04,083
HUH?

151
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:08,875
OKAY, WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

152
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:12,041
- YOU'RE SO AWFULLY SNEAKY,
RYOKO.

153
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,208
- HA HA, I GUESS WE'RE
ALL JUST TRYING

154
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:15,000
TO CREATE OUR OWN IDEAL WORLD,

155
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:16,375
AREN'T WE?
- UHH...

156
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,916
OH, NO, THAT'S NOT
WHAT I WAS DOING.

157
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,458
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT I WAS DOING.

158
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,125
I WAS JUST TRYING TO STOP
RYOKO'S TREACHERY, THAT'S ALL.

159
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:24,833
- WHAT YOU WERE DOING,

160
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:26,166
WAS YOU WERE THINKING ABOUT
GETTING TENCHI

161
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:29,333
WITH THIS MACHINE.
- GO AHEAD, BE SELF-RIGHTEOUS.

162
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:30,541
- WOW.
( chuckles )

163
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:32,083
WHAT KIND OF WORLD
DO YOU WANT, RYO-OHKI?

164
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:33,625
- Both: HUH?  AAH!
- ( meowing )

165
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:34,791
- DON'T!
- SASAMI!

166
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:37,083
GET OUT OF MY WAY.

167
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:38,708
I CHOOSE--

168
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:40,791
- NOT SO FAST, AYEKA.
- ( both groan )

169
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:42,041
- LET ME GO!

170
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:43,958
- ( giggles )

171
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:47,125
THIS WAY KIYONE AND I
CAN ALWAYS BE PARTNERS.

172
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:48,708
NOW WOULDN'T THAT BE GREAT?

173
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:51,291
- ( shouts )
FORGET IT.

174
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:55,291
NO WAY.  I WANT A WORLD
TOTALLY DEVOID OF MIHOSHI!

175
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:56,291
AAH!

176
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:57,833
- A WORLD JUST FOR
TENCHI AND ME.

177
00:08:57,916 --> 00:08:59,958
THAT'S WHAT I WANT.
- ( overlapping arguing )

178
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,083
- WAIT, I'M NOT KIDDING.
- ( rumbling )

179
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:08,708
- AAH!

180
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:11,625
- HUH?
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

181
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:13,166
- MM?

182
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,291
- ( all scream )

183
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:24,791
- ( gasping )

184
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:27,000
- HUH?
- WHAT IN THE WORLD IS THAT?

185
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:31,625
- OH, BOY...

186
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:33,791
HUH?  OH, NO!

187
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:38,000
MY INVENTION!
WHAT HAPPENED TO MY MACHINE?!

188
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:42,750
THE CONTROL PANEL'S
REALLY MESSED UP. HUH?

189
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:55,625
I CAN'T STOP IT NOW.

190
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:58,708
THE MACHINE IS TOTALLY
OUT OF MY CONTROL.

191
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:00,708
- ( all scream )

192
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,833
- LISTEN UP,
EVERYONE HERE WILL BE

193
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:08,333
TRAVELING THROUGH ENTANGLED
TIME AND SPACE VERY SOON.

194
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:11,875
IT'S POSSIBLE WE COULD ALL DRIFT
THROUGH MANY WORLDS FOREVER.

195
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:13,875
I'LL TRY TO FIX THIS DIMENSION--

196
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,000
- WASHU!

197
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:20,833
- WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO US NOW?

198
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:22,208
- HOW SHOULD I KNOW?

199
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:23,875
- WASHU!

200
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:30,416
- THIS IS REALLY STRANGE.

201
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,541
- HUH?

202
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:37,500
- ( all scream )

203
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:42,875
- YO!

204
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:48,666
YO!

205
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:52,208
- ( all screaming )

206
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:53,458
- EVERYONE HERE
WILL BE TRAVELING

207
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:56,041
THROUGH ENTANGLED
TIME AND SPACE VERY SOON.

208
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,875
WE COULD ALL DRIFT THROUGH
MANY POSSIBLE WORLDS FOREVER.

209
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:20,583
- HUH?

210
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:22,583
- LADY AYEKA.

211
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:25,541
- LORD TENCHI.
 YOU ARE HERE.

212
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,166
WHEN DID YOU GET HERE?

213
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,375
- JUST A MOMENT AGO.

214
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:35,208
I SUDDENLY FELT AN URGE
TO SEE YOU, LADY AYEKA.

215
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:38,208
- OH, TENCHI.
I AM FLATTERED.

216
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:39,833
- OH, AYEKA,
I MISSED YOU SO.

217
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:41,125
- TENCHI...

218
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:46,541
- ( thunder roars )

219
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,500
- A DEMON AT RASHOMON?

220
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:04,125
- YES, AYEKA. THE PURPOSE OF MY
JOURNEY WAS TO SEE THE EMPEROR.

221
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:06,416
HE ORDERED THAT I
SUBDUE THE DEMON

222
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,250
THAT HAS BEEN TERRORIZING
THE CAPITAL.

223
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,041
- THAT'S DANGEROUS.

224
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:12,250
- I HAVE TO
FOR OUR NATION.

225
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:15,166
PLEASE TRY TO UNDERSTAND,
AYEKA.

226
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,166
- OH, BE CAREFUL, TENCHI.

227
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,291
- THREE, FOUR, FIVE, SIX...

228
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,625
- MIHOSHI, KIYONE,

229
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,458
I REALLY APPRECIATE
THAT YOU CAME.

230
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:32,625
- MY PLEASURE.

231
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:34,458
- OH, DON'T MENTION IT, REALLY.

232
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:38,625
- MY FIANCE, LORD TENCHI,
IS ASSIGNED TO GO ON

233
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:41,958
AN EXPEDITION AGAINST 
THE DEMON AT RASHOMON.

234
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,791
I AM SURE YOU'VE HEARD OF THIS.

235
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:45,166
- OH, CERTAINLY.

236
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,291
- YOU KNOW, IT HAPPENS
TO BE THE TALK OF THE TOWN.

237
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:50,125
- AHEM.
- UH?

238
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:52,625
- YOU KNOW OUR WEDDING
IS COMING UP,

239
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,625
AND I DO NOT KNOW
WHAT I WOULD DO

240
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,708
IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO HIM.

241
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:58,708
( voice breaking ) 
I JUST DO NOT KNOW.

242
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,333
- OH, YOU MUST BE WORRIED.

243
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,541
- YOU MUST BE WORRIED.
YOU'LL BE AN OLD MAID 

244
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:06,333
IF YOU MISS THIS OPPORTUNITY,
RIGHT?

245
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:08,666
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?!
- I WAS SAYING--

246
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,333
- OH OH!
UH, HOW MAY WE BE OF SERVICE?

247
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:14,916
- WELL, I WAS HOPING THAT
YOU TWO COULD HELP TENCHI

248
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,250
WITH HIS QUEST.

249
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:17,208
- Both: WHAT?!

250
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:20,166
- THE DEMON AT RASHOMON
IS KNOWN TO BE

251
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,208
THE MOST WICKED VILLAIN,
ISN'T SHE?

252
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:24,708
- SHE'S COMMITTED
 NUMEROUS CRIMES,

253
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:26,875
AND ANYONE WHO EVER TRIED
TO CAPTURE HER

254
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:29,875
HAS NEVER COME BACK ALIVE.

255
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:34,875
- YOU TWO ARE THE MOST COMPETENT
POLICEMEN I KNOW.

256
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:36,583
PLEASE.

257
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:37,833
- UH...

258
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:39,625
- UH, WE ARE PUBLIC OFFICIALS

259
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:41,791
AND WE HAVE OTHER DUTIES
WE MUST FULFILL.

260
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:43,291
BUH-BYE.
- BYE!

261
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:46,541
- OH, WHAT A PITY.

262
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:49,041
I WAS GOING TO
MAKE YOU EXECUTIVES

263
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:50,291
AT THE POLICE DEPARTMENT,

264
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:54,750
IF YOU SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED
MY ASSIGNMENT.

265
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,416
- Both: HUH?

266
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,708
- OW!

267
00:13:57,791 --> 00:14:02,041
- LADY AYEKA,
DO YOU REALLY MEAN THAT, HUH?

268
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:05,250
- OH, NO, I'M SCARED!

269
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:08,375
- ALL RIGHT THEN,
WE'LL DO IT

270
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:10,291
AND WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN.

271
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,875
- HUH?  REALLY?
HOW NICE.

272
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:15,375
- THE PUBLIC SAFETY
OF THE CAPITAL IS OUR BUSINESS

273
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:16,958
AS POLICE OFFICERS!

274
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:19,166
REST ASSURED
YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED.

275
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,583
- OH, KIYONE...

276
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:24,000
- LADY AYEKA.

277
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:30,708
- ( crying )
I DON'T WANNA FIGHT THE DEMON!

278
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:36,958
- ( sighs )

279
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,875
HEY, RYOKO!

280
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:47,708
RYOKO, I KNOW YOU'RE UP THERE.

281
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:49,625
COME OUT.
- HMM?

282
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:50,958
- ( meows )

283
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,916
- AHH, TENCHI!

284
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:55,791
( chuckles )
- WHOA!

285
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,958
- I'M GLAD YOU CAME, TENCHI.

286
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:00,625
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO
ANYWHERE ELSE TODAY, DO YOU?

287
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:02,500
- UH...
- HMM? 

288
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:05,666
- I'VE GOT BAD NEWS FOR YOU.

289
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,666
I WAS ORDERED TO SUBDUE,
CONQUER AND KILL THE DEMON

290
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,750
AT RASHOMON.

291
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:12,583
- OH, THAT'S GONNA BE TOUGH.

292
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:14,958
WELL, LET ME HELP YOU, TENCHI.

293
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:18,791
- WHAT ARE TALKING ABOUT?
YOU ARE THE DEMON.

294
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,083
- OH, SO I AM.

295
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:23,125
- ( Mihoshi crying )

296
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:25,125
- QUIT WASTING TIME.
YOU'RE COMING WITH ME.

297
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:28,666
- I DON'T WANT TO!
THIS ISN'T A GOOD IDEA.

298
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,333
- OUR PROMOTIONS ARE AT STAKE.

299
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:33,583
WE'LL STAY AT THE
LOWEST RANK FOREVER

300
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,333
IF WE WASTE THIS
CHANCE, MIHOSHI.

301
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:37,041
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

302
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:39,458
- I'LL BE EATEN BY THE MONSTER!

303
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:41,666
- STOP WHINING
AND GET OVER HERE!

304
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,541
- AAH!

305
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:50,958
- IT'S YOUR FAULT.

306
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:53,708
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE COMMITTED
ONE CRIME AFTER ANOTHER.

307
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:56,125
- OH, WELL,
LET'S NOT WORRY ABOUT IT.

308
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:58,125
WHAT WILL BE WILL BE.

309
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:02,458
- RYOKO, TRY TO UNDERSTAND
MY POSITION, WILL YOU?

310
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:04,125
- THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO.

311
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:06,666
BECAUSE NOBODY KNOWS HOW
INTIMATE WE ARE WITH EACH OTHER,

312
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:07,666
DO THEY, TENCHI?

313
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,458
- DON'T TALK LIKE THAT.

314
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,708
TALK LIKE THAT CAN BE
VERY MISLEADING.

315
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:15,875
- WELL, YOU KNOW WE'VE ALREADY 
COME TO THE POINT OF NO RETURN.

316
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:18,541
- WHAT?
- BUT I SUPPOSE YOU AND I...

317
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:19,875
- AAH!
- ...CAN JUST RUN AWAY.

318
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:21,875
WE COULD JUST
RUN AWAY RIGHT NOW, COULDN'T WE?

319
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:23,625
- HEY! ( groans )

320
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:25,375
- DON'T YOU THINK IT'S
A BRILLIANT IDEA?

321
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:27,333
LET'S JUST DO IT.
- CUT IT OUT.

322
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:30,333
STAY AWAY FROM ME. I DON'T
WANT ANYBODY TO SEE US TOGETHER.

323
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:32,333
- WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG?
- ( Mihoshi whimpers )

324
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:34,666
- CLIMB UP HERE.

325
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,625
LET'S GO, OKAY?

326
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:41,333
TENCHI, WE ARE HERE
AS YOUR BACKUP.

327
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:43,000
- NOW THAT WE'RE HERE,

328
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:45,333
YOU'LL DEFINITELY HAVE THE
UPPER HAND, TENCHI.

329
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:48,125
- HUH?
- ( both scream )

330
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,166
- TENCHI, YOU ARE--

331
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,666
- THE DEMON'S
SECRET BOYFRIEND, HUH?

332
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,666
- OH, NO, NOW REALLY,
THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU THINK.

333
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,000
- WELL, THERE.
SO NOW YOU KNOW.

334
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,000
- AAH!

335
00:16:59,083 --> 00:16:59,708
- JUST DON'T LEAK
THIS INFORMATION

336
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:00,666
TO THE PRESS, THOUGH.

337
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,625
- ( Tenchi screams )

338
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,708
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

339
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:10,791
THANK YOU FOR
UNDERSTANDING, KIYONE.

340
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:13,666
- WELL, WE DIDN'T HAVE
MUCH OF A CHOICE.

341
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,791
- DON'T LET AYEKA KNOW
ABOUT ANY OF THIS, PLEASE.

342
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:18,416
- OF COURSE NOT.

343
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,916
IF AYEKA FOUND OUT
ABOUT ANY OF THIS,

344
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,416
I'D BE IN BIG TROUBLE TOO,
YOU KNOW, TENCHI.

345
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,625
- SORRY ABOUT THAT.

346
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,958
- I PASSED THE MESSAGE ON
TO MIHOSHI TOO,

347
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:29,583
SO THERE SHOULDN'T BE
ANY MIX-UPS.

348
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:31,666
- Mihoshi: IT WAS QUITE A SHOCK
TO ME, YOU KNOW?

349
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,291
- Both: HUH?!

350
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:37,458
- WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
THAT TENCHI AND THAT DEMON

351
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:39,416
WERE AN ITEM, HUH?

352
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,500
IT'S SO SCANDALOUS,
DON'T YOU THINK?

353
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,333
I MEAN, THEY REALLY DID
SEEM VERY CLOSE.

354
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:45,500
- YOU KNOW, YOU REALLY
CAN'T TELL--

355
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,750
- DO YOU HAVE A MINUTE, TENCHI?

356
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:54,750
- UH, SURE.
UH, AYEKA, WHY ARE YOU HERE?

357
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:56,958
- I WAS SO WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

358
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:59,458
AND SO I CAME TO
CHECK ON YOU, TENCHI.

359
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:01,791
SO, WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO
SAY FOR YOURSELF?

360
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:03,500
- ( nervous laughter )

361
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,875
YOU DON'T MEAN TO TELL ME YOU
REALLY BELIEVE ALL THAT STUFF?

362
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:08,041
- ( nervous chuckle )
 YOU KNOW SHE'S NUTS.

363
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,750
- ARE YOU SURE?
- I'M SO CERTAIN.

364
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:14,333
- KIYONE, IF I FIND OUT
THAT YOU ARE LYING,

365
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:16,416
I WILL MAKE SURE
YOU GET DEMOTED.

366
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,625
- WHAT?  OH, NO.
DEMOTED?

367
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:21,125
- UH-HUH.

368
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:23,958
- TENCHI, COME ON.
IT'S TIME TO GET OUT OF HERE.

369
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:25,125
- ( Tenchi and Kiyone scream )

370
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:27,125
- RYOKO, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

371
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:29,375
- WHAT, LIKE WE DIDN'T
PLAN THIS?

372
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:30,791
- ( yelps )

373
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:34,416
- WE DECIDED TO RUN AWAY
TOGETHER, YOU AND I, DIDN'T WE?

374
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,791
I COULDN'T WAIT ANY LONGER, SO I
WENT AHEAD AND PACKED MY STUFF.

375
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:39,500
- ALL RIGHT, TENCHI...

376
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:41,208
I WANT YOU TO TELL ME WHO
IS THIS WOMAN.

377
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:43,208
- WOMAN?  UM...

378
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:44,666
- WAIT A MINUTE.
WHO ARE YOU?

379
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:48,291
- WHO AM I?
I AM TENCHI'S OFFICIAL FIANCE,

380
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:49,833
THAT'S ALL.

381
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:52,708
- WELL, I GUESS THAT MAKES ME
HIS OFFICIAL MISTRESS THEN.

382
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:54,666
- HMM?
- AAH, NOT TRUE!

383
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:59,541
- UH, ARE YOU WHAT PEOPLE
CALL THE DEMON OF RASHOMON?

384
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:02,166
- THERE YOU GO.
SO, YOU ALREADY KNEW ABOUT US.

385
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,166
DON'T WE MAKE
A FANTASTIC COUPLE?

386
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,500
- ( groans )
- ( grunts )

387
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:08,708
- JUST WHAT DOES THIS WOMAN
HAVE THAT I DON'T?

388
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:11,833
CAN YOU TELL ME THAT, TENCHI?
HUH?  CAN YOU?

389
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:14,750
- HEY, WHAT DO YOU THINK
 YOU'RE DOING TO MY MAN?

390
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:18,333
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOUR MAN?
HE'S NOT YOUR MAN!

391
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:19,916
- AND GET OFF YOUR HIGH HORSE!

392
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,291
- HEY, NOW!  WHO DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE TALKING TO?

393
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:25,333
- YOU'RE THE GIRL
WHO GOT DUMPED BY TENCHI.

394
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:26,791
- ( groans )

395
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:29,333
- YOU JUST DON'T KNOW
WHEN TO STOP!

396
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:33,791
- HMM...

397
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,000
- EVERYTHING IS
TOTALLY MESSED UP.

398
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:40,333
- THE ONLY THING LEFT FOR ME
TO DO IS TO ELIMINATE

399
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:42,958
THE MULTIPLE WORLDS ONE BY ONE.

400
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:48,458
- ( shouts )  AAH!

401
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:50,666
YOU HOLD STILL
AND I'LL FINISH YOU MYSELF.

402
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,583
- WHOA!  WATCH OUT!

403
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:54,208
- HA, I'LL HOLD STILL.

404
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,708
- ( growls )

405
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:02,208
- ( chuckles )

406
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:04,833
- PREPARE TO DIE!

407
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,666
THAT WON'T HURT ME.

408
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,750
- HERE!

409
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,750
- AAH!

410
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:16,250
- ( Tenchi screams )

411
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:17,291
- HERE.
- ( screams )

412
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:22,125
- HERE'S THE DEMON.
COME ON, RIGHT HERE.

413
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:24,083
- YOU ARE A DEMON,
AREN'T YOU?!

414
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:27,083
- LADY AYEKA,
YOU MUST CALM DOWN.

415
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:28,458
- YOU MUST BE DEMOTED.

416
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:38,208
- WHEWIE!  THERE, NOW.

417
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:40,208
THIS DIMENSION IS ENCLOSED.

418
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:42,750
LET'S ELIMINATE THE FIRST ONE.
CANCEL.

419
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:50,958
- KIYONE, GET A HOLD
OF YOURSELF.

420
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,916
- TENCHI, LET'S RUN AWAY
TOGETHER.

421
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,916
- I TOLD YOU, LORD TENCHI
IS MY FIANCE.

422
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,083
- ( girls growl )

423
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,208
- HUH?
- HUH?

424
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:07,958
- ( all screaming )

425
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:15,375
- THUS BEGIN THE SPECIAL
EPISODES OF "TENCHI MUYO."

426
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:17,166
- TENCHI AND THE WHOLE GANG

427
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,041
HAVE TRAVELED THROUGH
TIME AND SPACE.

428
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:22,541
WHAT KIND OF WORLD
DO YOU THINK AWAITS THEM NEXT?

429
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:25,875
WILL THEY EVER BE ABLE TO COME
BACK TO THEIR ORIGINAL WORLD?

430
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:27,500
WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THEM?

431
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:29,000
- WATCH "TENCHI: GENESIS,

432
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:32,291
JOURNEY THROUGH TIME AND SPACE,
PART TWO" AND FIND OUT.

433
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,333
- Both: WE LOOK FORWARD
TO SEEING YOU THERE.

00:23:28,791 --> 00:23:30,291
RYOKO IS A JUVENILE DELINQUENT

459
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:34,000
AND AYEKA IS CLASS PRESIDENT,
WHEN A MYSTERIOUS GIRL APPEARS.

460
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:36,791
- TRANSFORM INTO 
PRETTY SAMMY NOW.

461
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:39,416
OKAY, RYO-OHKI,
DUKE 'EM, DUKE 'EM.

00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:43,291
GO ALONG THE RACE.
SAMMY DAVIS, JR. BOILED CHICKEN!

COMING NEXT IS "JOURNEY THROUGH
