29
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:02,666
- I HEREBY PASS SENTENCE
UPON THE DEFENDANT,

30
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,333
PROFESSOR WASHU.

31
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,333
THE DEFENDANT
SHALL BE IMPRISONED

32
00:02:06,416 --> 00:02:08,541
IN AN ALPHA-L MODEL
RESTRICTION CAPSULE...

33
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:10,208
- ...AND EXILED.
- ( whimpers )

34
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:12,291
NOW WAIT JUST A MINUTE!

35
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:15,083
EXACTLY WHAT DID I DO
TO DESERVE THIS?

36
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:18,916
ALL I DID WAS INVENT
DIMENSION OSCILLATING BULLETS,

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,583
O-ZONE DESTROYING CANNONS,

38
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:23,416
AND A TIME-SPACE CONVERTING
TACHYON RAY.

39
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,833
- ISN'T THAT MORE THAN ENOUGH,
PROFESSOR?

40
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:30,833
- AAH!

41
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:39,916
MM.

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,291
- WAKE UP, WASHU.

43
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:43,541
GOOD MORNING, WASHU.

44
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,083
- UHH... HUH?

45
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:47,125
( groans )
THAT'S RIGHT.

46
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,375
I DIDN'T SLEEP AT ALL.

47
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:55,000
HMM.

48
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:56,333
IT'S WORKING.

49
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:58,500
META-DRIVE, PROPULSION,

50
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:00,708
EXTERIOR CODING.
FINALLY.

51
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:02,750
THE THIRD PHASE 
IS NOW COMPLETE.

52
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:04,416
- WASHU, YOU ARE A GENIUS.

53
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,375
- THE GREATEST IN
THE UNIVERSE!

54
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:07,958
- ( laughs )

55
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:09,291
PIECE OF CAKE!

56
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:14,625
- IT WON'T BE LONG NOW.
( chuckles )

57
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:18,208
- YO!

58
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:23,958
- HEY, MISS. I GOT THIS RICE
FROM THE BLACK MARKET

59
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:25,166
JUST FOR YOU.

60
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,625
IT'S A SPECIAL BLEND.

61
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:28,416
IT'S THE VERY BEST KIND.

62
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,500
- OH, REALLY.
IS THIS FOR ME?

63
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:33,750
- BUT IN RETURN,
YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT.

64
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:36,125
- OH, NO.
I DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

65
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:38,500
NO, NO!

66
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:40,125
- HI!

67
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:42,791
IT'S TIME FOR THE
'HAPPY KIDS FUN TIME PLAY HOUR'.

68
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:45,458
HOW ARE ALL YOU
HAPPY KIDS TODAY?

69
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,750
- FINE! AND YOU?

70
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,291
- UHH...

71
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:50,791
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

72
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:51,958
- WHAT?

73
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:54,541
- IT WAS JUST GETTING
TO THE JUICY PART.

74
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:56,833
UH... A CLIMACTIC MOMENT!

75
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:58,791
- OH, I'M SORRY.

76
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:01,125
- OKAY. SO ANYWAY,
MIHOSHI,

77
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,541
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

78
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,958
- I WAS GOING TO
INVITE MYSELF TO LUNCH?

79
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:07,291
- WELL, I'M SORRY. WE
FINISHED LUNCH AWHILE AGO.

80
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:08,875
- WHAT?!

81
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,750
YOU'VE ALREADY EATEN LUNCH?

82
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,666
- TENCHI, YOU KNOW WHAT?

83
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,333
WASHU DIDN'T SHOW UP
FOR BREAKFAST OR LUNCH.

84
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,458
I WONDER IF THERE'S
ANYTHING WRONG WITH HER.

85
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:19,625
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

86
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:21,125
- YOU'RE RIGHT, SASAMI.

87
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:22,875
I THINK I'LL GO
CHECK ON HER.

88
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,458
- ( knocks on door )
- WASHU?

89
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,041
WASHU?

90
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:32,041
SHE ISN'T HERE.

91
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,833
OH, TENCHI, IT'S YOU.

92
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:38,041
WHAT IS IT?

93
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,583
- WELL, YOU MISSED
A COUPLE OF MEALS.

94
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,625
WE WERE WONDERING WHAT
WAS GOING ON, THAT'S ALL.

95
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:44,125
- ( chuckles )

96
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:45,500
YOU WANT TO KNOW?

97
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:46,916
- YOU DO WANT TO KNOW!

98
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,041
- COME ON,
LET US SHOW YOU.

99
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:51,000
- UH...

100
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,500
- OKAY THEN.
COME OVER HERE.

101
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:55,708
- UH, BUT...

102
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:58,041
- I COULD ACTUALLY
USE SOME HELP, SO...

103
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:08,333
( chuckles )
HERE IT IS.

104
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:10,541
WHAT IS THIS?

105
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:13,416
- THIS IS MY LATEST INVENTION,
TENCHI.

106
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,875
MECHA-WASHU.

107
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:16,833
- MECHA-WASHU?

108
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,833
WHAT'D YOU MAKE
THIS THING FOR?

109
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:23,375
- WELL, SINCE I'VE BEEN
SEALED OFF FOR A LONG 700 YEARS,

110
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:25,875
I'M WAY BEHIND SCHEDULE
WITH MY INVENTIONS.

111
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,875
I NEED AN ASSISTANT,
YOU SEE?

112
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:31,083
THIS MECHANICAL WASHU
IS JUST AS CAPABLE AS I AM,

113
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:34,625
WHICH MEANS NOW I CAN WORK
TWICE AS FAST!

114
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:37,375
- AND IS IT FINISHED YET,
WASHU?

115
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:38,708
- THE ONLY THING LEFT TO DO

116
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:40,416
IS TO INPUT MY MIND DATA.

117
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,041
- AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS?

118
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,250
- THEN IT WILL BE FINISHED,
OF COURSE.

119
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:45,416
- Both: HUH?

120
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,583
- WHOA, HEY.
HOW'D YOU GET IN HERE?

121
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,083
- MMM...

122
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:52,208
WELL, I USED THE DOOR?

123
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:53,916
- YOU CAME THROUGH
THE DOORWAY,

124
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,375
TENCHI AND I CAME HERE
THROUGH PSEUDO-SPACE. 

125
00:05:57,458 --> 00:06:00,583
- WOW, WASHU.
WHAT IS THIS THING?

126
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:03,541
- USING EXCESS ENERGY
FROM PSEUDO-SPACE,

127
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:07,333
THIS INVENTION DUPLICATES
THE RECORDED MIND DATA.

128
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:09,458
- OH, WOW.

129
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:10,791
IS THAT RIGHT?

130
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,458
- YOU UNDERSTAND NOW?

131
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:15,000
- HUH.
- YOU DON'T GET IT.

132
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,083
- UH...
- GET OUT OF MY WAY.

133
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:18,041
- AWW.

134
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:22,416
- OKAY, TENCHI.
HERE WE GO.

135
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,791
I WILL NOW BE
TRANSFERRING THE DATA.

136
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,625
COULD YOU TURN ON
THE SWITCH ON THE BOTTOM RIGHT

137
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:27,916
OF THAT CONSOLE?

138
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,291
- UH, IS THIS IT?

139
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:33,291
- NO, THE ONE BELOW THAT.

140
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:34,916
- THIS MUST BE IT.

141
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,500
- ( grunts )

142
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:37,625
AAH!

143
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:40,041
- UH...
- THIS, NO. THIS, NO. THIS?

144
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,291
NO!
- HEY, YOU!

145
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,666
DON'T PLAY AROUND WITH THAT.
STOP THAT!

146
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,958
- OH NO.

147
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:53,625
WHAT DO I DO NOW?

148
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:55,958
- AAH!

149
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,458
- ( both scream )

150
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:02,791
- ( groans )

151
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,291
OHH...

152
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:08,000
OH.

153
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:09,291
- ( giggles )

154
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,375
- LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO ME!

155
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:13,708
- I'M SORRY.

156
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,333
- All: HUH?

157
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:19,458
- GREAT!
NO DAMAGE AT ALL.

158
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:20,958
I'VE DONE IT!

159
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,625
I'M FINALLY FINISHED.

160
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,541
- YOU DID IT, WASHU.

161
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:26,333
- YOU'RE GREAT, WASHU.

162
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:29,333
- OKAY! MOVE, MECHA-WASHU.

163
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:30,458
- ALL RIGHT.

164
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:35,666
- OH YEAH! COME ON.
THAT'S MY GIRL.

165
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,666
SHE LOOKS GREAT.
COME TO ME NOW, YEAH.

166
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:42,666
- UHH...

167
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,750
- HUH?

168
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:46,208
- IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG,
WASHU?

169
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:49,166
- UH...

170
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,375
- Both: YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GETTING KIND OF HUNGRY.

171
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:57,000
- HEY, YOU ARE TOO?

172
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:59,083
- HEY, ARE YOU, TOO?

173
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:03,583
- ( sighs )

174
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:04,875
( grunts )

175
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:06,375
HUH, HUH?

176
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:08,000
( gasps )

177
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:09,083
WHAT IS THIS?

178
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,041
- A BLONDE HAIR.

179
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:16,000
- IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THE
GENETIC DATA FROM THIS HAIR

180
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:18,208
GOT IMPRINTED INTO
MECHANICAL WASHU?!

181
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:19,458
- WHY? WHAT HAPPENED?

182
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:22,583
- ( gasps )

183
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,916
HOW COULD YOUR MIND DATA
BE TRANSFERRED

184
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,208
INSTEAD OF MINE BECAUSE OF
JUST ONE PIECE OF HAIR?!

185
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:29,250
- WELL...

186
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:30,958
- HOW COULD YOUR GENETIC
INFORMATION

187
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:33,958
OVERRIDE MINE?!
- I'M SORRY AGAIN.

188
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:37,083
- THE ROBOT IS GONE!

189
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:38,458
- Both: HUH?

190
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:39,958
- IT HAS TO BE
SOMEWHERE AROUND HERE,

191
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:41,958
AND WE'VE GOT TO FIND IT.
- UH-HUH.

192
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:45,416
- WHA--?!

193
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,791
IT'S EMPTY.

194
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,833
- ( meows )

195
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:59,291
- COME ON. COME ON.

196
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:01,250
YOU WANT THIS,
DON'T YOU?

197
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,750
- OH, NO.
NOT SO FAST.

198
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:06,833
NOT SO FAST.
NOT SO FAST.

199
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:09,500
- WE INTERRUPT THIS REGULARLY
SCHEDULED PROGRAM

200
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,166
FOR A SPECIAL REPORT.

201
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,666
- OH NO.

202
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,708
- BANK ROBBERS BROKE INTO
THE BANANA BANK.

203
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:18,958
- ARE WE EVER GOING TO
BE ABLE TO SEE THIS SOAP OPERA?

204
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:21,333
- AND IT WAS JUST GETTING
TO THE GOOD PART.

205
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:23,083
- ( chewing )
- OH MY.

206
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:24,958
I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING
ABOUT THIS.

207
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:25,916
- HUH?

208
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:33,000
- Both: HUH?

209
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,166
- UH, OKAY.

210
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,500
- HUH?
- WHAT?

211
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,666
- Both: HMM?

212
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,291
- HEY THERE, YOU PEOPLE.
DID I JUST COME THROUGH HERE?

213
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:48,458
OKAY, THANKS.

214
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:50,333
NOW HOW DID IT GET
OUT OF THAT ROOM? 

215
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,833
- AYEKA, WHAT WAS THAT?

216
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:57,208
- WE'RE JUST SEEING THINGS,
RYOKO.

217
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:02,250
- HMM?

218
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:03,708
OH, DARN.

219
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:06,041
I DON'T HAVE A CAR
TO GET INTO THE CITY.

220
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:09,000
- HOLD IT RIGHT THERE.

221
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:11,041
- WHAT?
- FINALLY, I FOUND YOU.

222
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:14,125
NOW LET'S GO BACK TO 
THE LAB THIS INSTANT, OKAY?

223
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:15,708
- PLEASE DON'T STOP ME.

224
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:17,250
I HAVE TO SAVE
THE HOSTAGES, 

225
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,500
AND STOP THE BANK ROBBERS.

226
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:19,583
I HAVE TO GO.

227
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:21,250
- HUH?

228
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,833
- THAT BANK IS BEING
ROBBED RIGHT NOW,

229
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:26,041
AND AS A GALAXY POLICE OFFICER,
I HAVE TO--

230
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,250
- YOU'RE NOT A GALAXY
POLICE OFFICER!

231
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:31,625
- WELL, I THINK YOU'D BETTER
LEAVE IT TO THE LOCAL POLICE,

232
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:32,625
YOU KNOW.

233
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:34,041
- WE MUST GO CATCH
THOSE SUSPECTS.

234
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:35,541
- WILL YOU SHUT UP?!

235
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:38,291
- OKAY.
- AND YOU, WAIT RIGHT THERE!

236
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,416
- IF YOU TRY TO KEEP ME HERE
ANY LONGER,

237
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,125
IT WILL CONSTITUTE
AN OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE.

238
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,583
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,
HUH?!

239
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:49,166
- ALL RIGHT.
THIS IS NECESSARY

240
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,416
TO DO JUSTICE.

241
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,958
- GO ON, WASHU.

242
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:54,041
- LET'S GO, WASHU.

243
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:56,458
- WHAT?! YOU TRAITOR!

244
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:58,166
- ARE YOU READY FOR THIS?

245
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:02,416
MECHA-WASHU PUNCH!

246
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,750
- STOP IT!
- ( screams )

247
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,416
- WHAT?

248
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,500
- UH-OH.

249
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:09,791
COME ON. COME OUT.

250
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,041
- OH.
- AH...

251
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:20,583
- ( grunts )

252
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:26,000
- I GOT HER.

253
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:28,791
- ARE YOU OKAY, MIHOSHI?

254
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:30,791
- IT HURTS.

255
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:33,458
- WASHU, WHY DID YOU
MAKE THAT WEAPON?

256
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:36,750
- IT'S A DEFENSE MECHANISM,
JUST IN CASE.

257
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:40,125
AS A GENIUS, I ALWAYS HAVE TO
BE PREPARED FOR THE WORST.

258
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,791
- UH-HUH.
SHE IS A GENIUS.

259
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:44,458
- YEP.
A GENIUS CAN'T HELP IT.

260
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:46,250
- OH.

261
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:48,875
BUT SHE CREATES THE WORST.

262
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,750
- ( murmurs )

263
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:53,375
- YO!

264
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:05,833
- ( screaming )

265
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:08,166
- ( pants )

266
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:12,250
YOU'VE GOT NOWHERE
TO HIDE NOW.

267
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:17,166
MECHA-WASHU BEAM!

268
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,625
- WE CAN'T HEAR THE TV.

269
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,625
WHAT'S WITH ALL THE NOISE,
WASHU?

270
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,500
- OH, I AM SO SORRY.

271
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:24,833
- WATCH OUT!

272
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,291
- OH! UH...

273
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,583
( groans )

274
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:34,500
- NOW I WOULD GO AND INVENT
A MACHINE LIKE THAT.

275
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:37,041
I'LL SAY SHE'S GOT
SOME POWER.

276
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:39,291
- WASHU, YOU ARE POWERFUL.

277
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,541
- YOU ARE GREAT, WASHU.
WHOO-HOO!

278
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:42,875
- ( laughing )

279
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:44,541
- WIPE THAT SMILE
OFF YOUR FACE!

280
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:47,500
- ( humming )

281
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:50,166
( slurps )

282
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:53,500
EVERYBODY SEEMS
TO BE HAVING FUN,

283
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:54,833
AS USUAL.

284
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,875
- ( meows )

285
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:01,666
- NOW I'M GONNA HAVE TO--

286
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,000
- USE THOSE SPECIAL TACTICS,
WASHU, RIGHT?

287
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,083
- WE ARE ALL BEHIND YOU,
WASHU.

288
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:07,375
- HUH?

289
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:11,000
- WE CALL THIS...

290
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,666
"OPERATION VOLLEYBALL!"

291
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:37,000
( grunts )

292
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:43,250
( chuckles )
PREPARE TO DIE.

293
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:46,541
NOBODY'S EVER SURVIVED
THIS ATOM DESTROYING BALL,

294
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,250
AND I MEAN NOBODY!

295
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,208
I'LL EXPLAIN.

296
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:52,000
WHEN SOMEONE SPIKES THIS BALL,

297
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:54,500
IT THOROUGHLY AND COMPLETELY
DISRUPTS THE ATOMS

298
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:55,833
OF THE TARGET,

299
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:58,750
SO IT'S ONE CLEVER WEAPON
IF I DO SAY SO MYSELF.

300
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,416
OKAY.

301
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,666
AND SERVE!

302
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,041
HUH?

303
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:06,250
OH WELL.

304
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:08,416
I HAVEN'T PRACTICED
IN 700 YEARS

305
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,375
AND MY AIM NEEDS WORK.

306
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:13,625
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"NEEDS WORK"? OH NO!

307
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:14,625
- AAH!

308
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:15,916
YAAH!

309
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,916
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
RYOKO?

310
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,250
- HERE IT COMES.

311
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:20,541
- HUH, HUH?

312
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:21,833
HERE.

313
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:23,208
- HMM?!

314
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:28,416
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING,
AYEKA?

315
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,250
- OH, EXCUSE ME.
I'M SO SORRY.

316
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,375
- TENCHI,
IT'S COMING AT YOU.

317
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,875
- WHOA.

318
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:37,875
- THIS IS IT.

319
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:41,250
- ATTACK!

320
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,166
- MISSED ME.

321
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:55,791
- THERE GOES MY
VEGETABLE GARDEN.

322
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:56,875
( sighs )

323
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,708
- ( meowing )

324
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:02,666
( meows )

325
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:06,791
( crying meows )

326
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,416
- ALL RIGHT, THEN.

327
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,500
I DON'T WANT TO USE THIS, 
BUT YOU GIVE ME NO CHOICE.

328
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:22,958
- WHAT IS IT?

329
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:25,291
- IT'S MECHA-WASHU'S 
SELF-DESTRUCT DEVICE.

330
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:29,500
- YOU MEAN TO TELL ME YOU HAD
THAT CHOICE ALL ALONG, WASHU?

331
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:32,041
- HEY, SHE TOOK ME A LONG TIME
TO CREATE, YOU KNOW.

332
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:35,833
GOOD-BYE,
MY MECHANICAL WASHU.

333
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:38,500
I HAD WANTED TO TAKE OVER
THE UNIVERSE WITH YOU.

334
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:43,666
- ( all scream )

335
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:46,208
- AAH!

336
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:49,625
- MAY HER SPIRIT
REST IN PEACE.

337
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,541
- COME TO ME,
SPARE BODY.

338
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,958
AAH!

339
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,541
- ( groans )

340
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:10,500
OH NO!
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

341
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,375
IT'S THE SPARE BODY
I WAS RESERVING.

342
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:26,208
- AH.

343
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:27,958
I THOUGHT THAT
I WAS GONE.

344
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:30,458
- ( all groan )

345
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:33,708
- KILLING AN OFFICER
IS A VERY GRAVE OFFENSE.

346
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,541
YOU MUST BE SEVERELY PUNISHED.

347
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,000
- ( all murmur )

348
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:38,625
- MECHA-WASHU!

349
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:41,958
BEAM!

350
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:43,333
- ( all scream )

351
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:52,916
- OH BOY.

352
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,625
NOW WHAT'S HAPPENING?

353
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:59,416
UH...

354
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,166
( crying )

355
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:06,916
- IT IS WAY PAST
OUR ASSIGNED PATROLLING TIME.

356
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,916
I WONDER WHAT MIHOSHI
IS UP TO NOW?

357
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:19,916
- YOU CAN'T TREAT ME LIKE THAT.
YOU CAN'T TREAT ME LIKE THAT.

358
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,583
YOU CAN'T TREAT ME LIKE THAT.

359
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,666
- WHAT IS THAT?

360
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,583
- HMM?

361
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:28,166
- Both: HI, KIYONE.

362
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,083
- HUH?

363
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:33,125
- KIYONE, YOU HAVE TO
LISTEN TO ME.

364
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:35,833
- THESE GUYS ARE REALLY
GANGING UP ON ME, KIYONE.

365
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:38,291
AND THEY'RE REALLY
GETTING IN MY WAY.

366
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:39,625
- UH...

367
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:42,291
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

368
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:43,625
- ( crying )

369
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:44,875
- KIYONE, BE CAREFUL!

370
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:49,833
- WHOA-HO!

371
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:54,875
- ( crying continues )

372
00:17:58,208 --> 00:18:00,583
- WASHU, DO SOMETHING.

373
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:05,125
- THE SPARE BODY ISN'T
EQUIPPED TO SELF DESTRUCT.

374
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:07,166
- AAH!

375
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,125
- TENCHI, DOES THAT ROBOT
HAVE THE MIND OF MIHOSHI?

376
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:11,208
IS THAT IT?

377
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,625
- ( crying )

378
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,666
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU GUESSED IT.

379
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,625
- ( chuckles )

380
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:25,416
- YOU KNOW YOU ARE
UNBELIEVABLE?!

381
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,666
TROUBLEMAKER IS
AN UNDERSTATEMENT.

382
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,000
- I KNOW. SORRY.

383
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:33,833
- AAH!

384
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:35,541
AND WHAT ARE WE
GOING TO DO NOW?!

385
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:38,541
- KIYONE, PLEASE.
HELP US.

386
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:44,458
- IF THE ROBOT AND MIHOSHI
TRULY THINK ALIKE,

387
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:50,958
TENCHI, THIS WILL WORK.

388
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:52,166
- HUH?

389
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,000
- MIHOSHI,
YOU'D BETTER HURRY.

390
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:56,541
IT'S ALMOST STARTING NOW.

391
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:59,083
- HMM? AH!

392
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:00,750
- ( crying )

393
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,250
- ( panting )

394
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:04,541
I DON'T WANT TO MISS ANYTHING.

395
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:07,875
- OH MY GOODNESS! 
IT'S ALREADY TIME.

396
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:14,375
- ( pants )

397
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:16,041
- ( panting )

398
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:18,375
- OKAY...

399
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,833
- HMM.
- HUH?

400
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:26,875
- METAMORA FORCE!

401
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,875
AAH!

402
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,000
- YEAH, YEAH!

403
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:33,875
OH BOY!
- YES, GO, YEAH!

404
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:37,250
- SEE? I TOLD YOU
IT WAS GOING TO WORK, TENCHI.

405
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,916
- YEP, YOU TOLD ME
IT WAS GONNA WORK.

406
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,166
- NOW, TELL ME WHERE IS
THE SWITCH FOR ITS POWER?

407
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,833
- THE POWER SWITCH IS
BEHIND HER NECK.

408
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:47,041
- WOW.

409
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:49,833
- WOW. IT'S A GREAT SHOW.

410
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:51,250
YOU ARE SUCH A GOOD GIRL.

411
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,416
NOW HOLD STILL
FOR ME, OKAY? 

412
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,750
- WOW! WOW.

413
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:58,625
WOW. WOW.

414
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:01,708
WOW...

415
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:03,666
WOW... WOW.

416
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:05,708
- ( sighs )

417
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:07,583
- KIYONE,
WHEN IT COMES TO KNOWING

418
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:09,083
HOW MIHOSHI'S MIND WORKS,

419
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,416
YOU'RE AN EXPERT!

420
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,958
- OH, IT'S NOT SOMETHING
I'M PROUD OF.

421
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:15,750
YOU HAVE NO IDEA. TRUST ME.
- HA!

422
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:17,708
- COME AND GET IT.
EVERYBODY, DINNER'S READY.

423
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,125
LET'S GO. COME ON.

424
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:21,416
- OH, GREAT.
IT'S DINNERTIME.

425
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,416
'CAUSE I WAS REALLY STARVING,

426
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,791
AND I AM SO
READY TO EAT!

427
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:28,083
UM, WASHU,
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

428
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:31,041
- YOU'RE SUCH AN AIRHEAD!

429
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:40,416
- WASHU, YOU ARE A GENIUS.

430
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,791
- WASHU, YOU ARE THE GREATEST
IN THE WORLD.

431
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,666
- I'VE FINALLY DONE IT.

432
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:49,625
I HAVE MADE SURE TO ONLY PUT
MY MIND DATA THIS TIME.

433
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:52,958
I'LL CALL HER
MECHA-WASHU TWO.

434
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:56,708
- All: OHH. HUH?

435
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:01,791
- HMM? WHAT?

436
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:03,583
AAH!

437
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:05,041
- ( meows )

438
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:07,166
- THIS MUST BE...

439
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,125
- RYO, RYO...

440
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:10,583
RYO-OHKI?!

441

443
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:17,166
NOW THIS IS FUNNY.

444
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,583

470
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:27,708
COME OUT AND SEE IT QUICKLY,
OHKI.

471
00:23:27,791 --> 00:23:30,125
- BRR! IT'S FREEZING TODAY.

472
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:34,291
OH, A DAY LIKE THIS IS PERFECT
FOR HAVING HOT SAKE.

473
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:37,250
- RYOKO IS GLUED
TO THE HEATER.

474
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:39,791
- ONE MORNING,
AS SNOW FALLS SILENTLY,

475
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:41,958
THE LONG FORGOTTEN MEMORIES
COME BACK TO US.

476
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:44,250
COMING UP NEXT IS
"NO NEED FOR MEMORIES."

477
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:45,791
YES, I REMEMBER.

478
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:48,000
IT WAS SNOWING LIKE THIS
ON THAT DAY.

479
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:50,875
- IT'S UNQUESTIONABLY
MELANCHOLIC.
