- YOU AGAIN, RYO-OHKI?

143
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:07,750
- AN UNBALANCED DIET
IS NOT GOOD FOR YOU.

144
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:09,666
- ( meows )

145
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:14,416

OH, WOW.
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE?

153
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:41,041
- TAKE A LOOK AT
THIS FROG RIGHT HERE.

154
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:42,625
THIS FROG IS NOT JUST
ANY FROG.

155
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:44,625
NO. NO ORDINARY FROG, THIS.

156
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:46,916
THIS FROG IS DIFFERENT
FROM ANY OTHER FROG.

157
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,708
IT'S A VERY SPECIAL FROG,

HOW IS IT DIFFERENT
FROM OTHER FROGS?

160
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:53,750
- I'M SO GLAD YOU ASKED,
MISS.

161
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,625
NOW LISTEN,
THIS FROG MAY LOOK LIKE

162
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,166
AN UGLY COMMON FROG,

163
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,166
BUT IT'S AN INHABITANT

164
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,583
OF ALPHA-CENTAUR AND SHULOCK

165
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:03,583

00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:06,125
THIS IS THE FAMOUS FROG
KNOWN AS...

00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,750
SHULOCK TOAD!

174
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:21,750
- THE TOAD STARTS TO SWEAT
AT THE HORRIBLE SIGHT OF ITSELF

175
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,541
REFLECTED IN THE MIRRORS.

176
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,500
- OH, WOW.

177
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,750
- I COLLECT ALL THE DROPS
OF ITS PERSPIRATION

178
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,791
IN A CERAMIC PAN
AND COOK IT SLOWLY,

179
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:35,416
STIRRING THE LIQUID

185
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,750
A DROP OF THIS
MIRACLE OIL

186
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:50,250
CAN CURE THEM ALL!

187
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:52,875
- YOU KNOW, I'M SUFFERING
FROM STIFF SHOULDERS AND STUFF.

188
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:54,333

214
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:43,875
WE'RE NO MONKEYS.

215
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,833
- Both: RIGHT.

216

250
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,958

HUH, SASAMI?

345
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,333

I CAN HANDLE ANY
LARGE QUANTITY OF ORDERS.

352
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:22,916

WHO MADE THAT THING?

353
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,041
- YEAH, TENCHI.

354
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:31,250

357
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:37,250

 I DON'T KNOW HOW.

358
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,458
- WHAT?!
- OH NO!

359
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:40,500

CONNECTED TO EACH OTHER
THROUGH THESE FAIRS, AREN'T WE?

363
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:56,958
- HMM. YEAH.

364
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:59,666
IT WAS AT A FAIR ON A PLANET 
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF JURAI.

365
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:03,916
- YES. THAT WAS
MY VERY FIRST TIME

366
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,125
TO BE OUT AMONG COMMON PEOPLE

367
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:08,625
TO EXPERIENCE A FAIR.

368
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:11,041

00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:19,166
YOU MEAN ME?

372
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,541
- YES, YOU.

373
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:22,291
WELL NOW, AREN'T YOU
THE LUCKY ONE?

374
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:25,083

375
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,500

377
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:30,625

378
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:31,833
- BUT I DON'T WANT IT.

379
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:34,625
- HEY NOW, DON'T BE SHY.
TAKE IT.

380
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:37,541
AND YOU'LL HAVE TO
PAY FOR IT, OF COURSE.

381
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:38,666
- OH!

382
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,208
HEY, WAIT!
GIVE ME BACK MY WALLET.

383
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:43,958
- OH, NO. NO REFUNDS
OR EXCHANGES.

384
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:46,375
YOU ARE SUCH A LIAR,
AYEKA.

385
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,833
- WHAT? A LIAR?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

386
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:51,333
- WHAT YOU JUST SAID.
ALL OF IT.

387
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:52,833
LISTEN.

388
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:54,333
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED.

389
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:57,875
YES, IT WAS
A COLD, COLD NIGHT,

390
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:59,375
CHILLING ME TO THE BONES.

391
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:02,041
I HAD WORKED SO HARD
TO MAKE ALL THAT POTTERY

392
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,541
WITH MY OWN HANDS,

393
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,250
BUT NO ONE CAME TO BUY.

394
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,083
NO ONE AT ALL.

395
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:10,375
- CAN I HELP YOU?
OHH...

396
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:12,208
- YOU THERE!
TELL ME,

397
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:14,333
WHO GAVE YOU PERMISSION
TO DO BUSINESS HERE?

398
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:15,791
- HUH?

399
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:17,875
- YOU SEE,
THIS IS THE FAIR

400
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,875
TO PRAISE JURAI'S
ROYAL FAMILY.

401
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:22,333
SO I CAN'T ALLOW YOU
TO DO BUSINESS HERE.

402
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:24,000
CAN YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

403
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:25,750
- I GUESS.

404
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:28,041
- HA. LOOK AT THIS
SHODDY BOOTH.

405
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:31,041
- OH!

406
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:32,791
AWW.

407
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:35,000
OH, WHY ARE YOU SO MEAN?

408
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:36,958
- HOW DARE YOU MAKE UP
A STORY LIKE THAT.

409
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:39,708
YOUR MEMORY MUST BE
COMPLETELY ROTTEN. 

410
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:42,375
- I'M TELLING YOU
JUST THE FACTS, YOU KNOW.

411
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:44,875
- WHERE ARE THE FACTS
IN YOUR STORY?

412
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:46,375
- IT'S ALL FACT.

413
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:48,625
EVERYTHING I SAID,
PRINCESS.

414
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,708
IT'S YOU WHO'S TELLING LIES.

415
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:52,500
YOU CAN'T GET BY
WITH ALL YOUR STORIES.

416
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,750
FACTS ARE FACTS,
AND PEOPLE CAN TELL, YOU KNOW?

417
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:56,583
MMM.
- REALLY.

418
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:58,375
YOU ARE SO HOPELESS!

419
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:01,083
IT IS NO USE TRYING
TO TALK TO YOU!

420
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,833
- SO WHO CARES?

421
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:04,166
I WANT TO MAKE YOU PAY

422
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,750
FOR WHAT YOU DID
TO ME BACK THEN.

423
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:08,083
- ( groans )

424
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,041
- ( crowd shouts )
- OH?

425
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,250
- HUH?

426
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:12,416
HUH?

427
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,750
- ( crowd screams )

428
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:21,958
- WHA--?

429
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:23,750
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

430
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,166
- ( both scream )

431
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:09,416
- ( giggles )

432
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,375
- SORRY, SASAMI.

433
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:13,500
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
A FUN EVENING AT THE FAIR,

434
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:15,000
BUT IT WAS
A REAL MESS.

435
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:16,375
YOU'RE DISAPPOINTED.

436
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:19,375
- MM-MM.

437
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:20,833
NO, I'M NOT.

438
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:23,375
I SURE AM NOT.

439
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:25,833

DELICIOUS!

440
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:28,041

- MECHA-WASHU IS A ROBOT
INVENTED BY WASHU.

466
00:23:27,541 --> 00:23:28,791
IT'S AN ALTER-EGO OF WASHU,

467
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:30,708
BUT THINGS GET MIXED UP
AND THIS POWERFUL ROBOT

468
00:23:30,791 --> 00:23:33,375
ASSUMES MIHOSHI'S PERSONALITY
INSTEAD.

469
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:34,541
- AHEM!

470
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:36,041
- WHAT ARE YOU ON YOUR
HIGH HORSE ABOUT?

471
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:38,291
- WASHU'S BRAIN COMBINED
WITH MIHOSHI'S PERSONALITY?

472
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,791
IT MAY AS WELL BE THE MOST
POWERFUL IN THE UNIVERSE. 

473
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:43,166
COMING UP NEXT IS
"NO NEED FOR A GENIUS."

474
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:44,708
THE BATTLE BETWEEN WASHU
AND MECHA-WASHU

475
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:46,250
IS ABOUT TO BEGIN.

476
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:48,333
- IT'S UNQUESTIONABLY
SPLENDID.
