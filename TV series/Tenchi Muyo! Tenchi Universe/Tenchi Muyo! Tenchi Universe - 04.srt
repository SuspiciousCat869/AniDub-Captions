WHY DON'T YOU HELP US CLEAN?

00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:46,708
TO WIPE THE FLOORS
WHILE YOU'RE AT IT, HUH?

UH, YES, MY PLEASURE.

YOU IDIOT.

51

- DID YOU SAY SOMETHING, RYOKO?

52
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:57,416
- NO, NOTHING.

53
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,833

00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:11,083
- YOU TOOK THEM FROM THERE?

59

A WHOLE BUNCH MORE TOO.

WOW, LUNCH.

COME QUICKLY BEFORE
IT GETS COLD.

68
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,583
- THANKS FOR TAKING THE TROUBLE.

69
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:36,666
- AND I AM SO HUNGRY.

70

WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

- ( meowing )

- ( birds flutter )

75
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:52,166
- EXCUSE ME, GRANDPA.

76
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,583
WHAT IS THAT THING
OVER THERE?

77
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,666
- AH, THAT THING?

78
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:00,500
WELL, SASAMI,
THERE IS A GOBLIN IN THERE.

79
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,416
- YO!

80
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:09,583
- Grandpa: IT ALL HAPPENED
700 YEARS AGO.

81
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:13,291
IT IS SAID, A HORRIBLE GOBLIN
CAME FROM THE SKY.

82
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:16,791
SO PEOPLE BUILT A SHRINE
WITH A MAGICAL FORCE FIELD

83
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:20,958
TO SEAL IN THE GOBLIN BECAUSE
THEY WERE AFRAID OF TROUBLE.

84
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:27,333
SASAMI THAT IS THE ORIGIN
OF THIS MASAKI SHRINE.

85
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:29,833
- A REAL GOBLIN, WOW!

86
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:31,500
- SOUNDS SCARY.

87
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:34,500
- DOES THE GOBLIN EXIST, REALLY?

88
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:37,208
- MAYBE IT DOES.
MAYBE IT DOES NOT.

89
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:39,750
BUT YOU STAY AWAY
FROM THAT PLACE. 

90
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:46,708
- A 700-YEAR-OLD GOBLIN?

91
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:50,500
- HEY, THIS COULD BE A FUN WAY
TO KILL SOME TIME.

92
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:53,000
COME ON, PRINCESS FRAIDY CAT,
LET'S CHECK IT OUT.

93
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:56,000
- EEK! EEK!
- COME ON, LET'S GO.

94
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:57,458
- NO THANK YOU!

95
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:58,708
WEREN'T YOU LISTENING

96
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:01,041
TO WHAT GRANDFATHER
WAS TELLING US, RYOKO?

97
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:03,791
- YEAH, AND I DON'T WANT
THE GOBLIN TO COME TO LIFE

98
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:06,000
AND, LIKE,
PUT A CURSE ON US, YOU KNOW?

99
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:08,208
- ME, I WOULD LIKE
TO SEE THE GOBLIN.

100
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:10,041
- ( meows excitedly )

101
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,083
- HMM, I'M WITH YOU.

102
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,333
LET'S FORGET ABOUT AYEKA.
COME ON.

103
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:15,625
OW!
- SASAMI, DON'T!

104
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:18,541
IF YOU GO,
I'LL BE SO WORRIED.

105
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:22,750
BESIDES, IT'S LUNCHTIME NOW.
LET'S GO HOME.

106
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:24,375
- ALL RIGHT.

107
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:30,041
- OKAY, I THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE FUN, 

108
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,875
BUT I DON'T WANT
TO GO ALONE.

109
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,458
( snickers )

110
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:55,750
- ( groaning )

111
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:59,166
( yawns, sighs )

112
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,500
THIS WALK TOOK A LOT LONGER
THAN I THOUGHT.

113
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:06,583
I AM STARVED.

114
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,208
I BETTER GET SOMETHING
TO EAT PRETTY SOON.

115
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:11,000
- ( whispers )
TENCHI.

116
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:13,625
- OOH! AH!

117
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,541
IT'S YOU, RYOKO.

118
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:19,416
- ( giggles )
WELCOME HOME, TENCHI.

119
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,791
- YOU KNOW, YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO
COME OUT HERE TO MEET ME, RYOKO.

120
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:26,208
- ( giggles )

121
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:27,625
HMM.

122
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:31,125
- RYOKO, WHAT'S THE DEAL
WITH THE ROPE?

123
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:32,541
- ( snickers )

124
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,916
- HEY, YOU'RE
CREEPING ME OUT.

125
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,958
- ( rope cracks )
- ( snickers )

126
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:39,791
- STOP IT!

127
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:47,416
- ( footsteps )

128
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:53,625
- WOW, IT SURE GOES
A LONG WAY BACK THERE, HUH?

129
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:57,125
- HEY, CAN WE GO HOME NOW?
COME ON, RYOKO.

130
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,875
- NO.

131
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:01,291
- RYOKO, YOU KNOW GRANDPA'S
BEEN TELLING ME

132
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,875
TO STAY AWAY
FROM THIS CAVE.

133
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:05,333
THEN THERE'S THAT STORY
ABOUT THE GOBLIN.

134
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:07,833
- YOU SCARED?
IS THAT IT, TENCHI?

135
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:10,500
- NO, THAT IS NOT IT.

136
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:13,416
- WELL, OKAY THEN.
LET'S EXPLORE TOGETHER.

137
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,083
- YOU'RE SO WEIRD.

138
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:17,000
- I DON'T LIKE 
ORDINARY DATES.

139
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:18,500
THIS IS BETTER, ISN'T IT?

140
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:19,708
- I DON'T KNOW.

141
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:21,666
- ( giggles )
YOU KNOW IT IS.

142
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:25,541
DON'T BE DIFFICULT.
- UH, DON'T PUSH ME LIKE THAT.

143
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:28,000
JUST LET ME GO HOME!

144
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,416
- ( meows )

145
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:37,666

( meows )

148
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:52,750
- TENCHI SHOULD HAVE
COME HOME BY NOW.

149
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:56,041
- WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED
TO TENCHI, I WONDER?

150
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:58,708
I MADE A NICE DINNER TONIGHT.

151
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:00,791
- ( all sigh )

152
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:03,208
- RYO-OHKI? HUH?

153
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:05,333
- ( meows )

154
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:09,166
- Sasami: RYO-OHKI, WHAT?
THAT'S TENCHI'S BAG, ISN'T IT?

155
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,833
- AHH! WHAT?

156
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:13,500
INDEED, THIS IS TENCHI'S BAG.

157
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:15,791
OH, WHERE DID YOU FIND THIS,
RYO-OHKI?

158
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:18,750
TELL ME.
- ( meowing )

159
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:22,083
( meowing continues )
- ( sighs )

160
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,541
OH!

161
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:26,416
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?!
- ( meowing )

162
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,291
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE--

163
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,125
- ( meowing )
- YOU TELL ME WHERE HE IS!

164
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:32,875
- RYO-OHKI, PLEASE TELL ME!

165
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,000
- I THINK
IF RYOKO WERE HERE,

166
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:36,416
WE'D UNDERSTAND
WHAT HE'S SAYING.

167
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,583
- RIGHT! IF RYOKO
WERE HERE, WE'D--

168
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:42,875
AHH.
- ( frightened meowing )

169
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,041
- UH, I AM SO ABSENT MINDED.

170
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,250
HOW COULD I HAVE FORGOTTEN
ABOUT THAT WOMAN?

171
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:50,500
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.
HOW COULD I BE SO STUPID?

172
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:53,583
- YES, RYOKO MUST
BE WITH TENCHI...

173
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:56,000
DOING THIS
AND DOING THAT.

174
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,166
HOW DARE SHE!

175
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:02,375
I BEG YOU, YOU SWEET
LITTLE THING, YOU,

176
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,250
PLEASE TAKE US TO RYOKO.

177
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:06,958
- ( meows )
- FOR FIVE CARROTS?

178
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,916
- ( excited meows )

179
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,041
- OH THANK YOU.

180
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:12,416
YOU'LL TAKE US THERE.

181
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,208
- HERE, THIS
IS TENCHI'S SCENT.

182
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:16,083
- ( sniffs )

183
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:17,875
( groans )

184
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,333
( meowing )

185
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,375
- NOW, LET'S GET GOING.

186
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:26,291
- Both: YAY.

187
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,125
- UH, IT'S A DEAD-END.

188
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,125
LET'S GIVE UP
AND GO HOME, RYOKO, HUH?

189
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:34,791
OH.

190
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,250
- ( grunts )

191
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:37,958
- WHOA!

192
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:41,625
( screaming )

193
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:44,791
OH MAN.
LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE NOW.

194
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,958
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
IF WE GET CURSED?

195
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:48,791
- I'LL THINK ABOUT THAT
IF IT HAPPENS.

196
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:52,125
- ( chortles )
- WHOA! OH!

197
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:54,541
WHAT WAS THAT?

198
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,500
HUH?

199
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:57,875
AHH!

200
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:00,958
- AHH!

201
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:06,666
- RYOKO, HEY, RYOKO.
OH, NO, NO.

202
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,791
RYOKO, YOU WERE
SUCH A GOOD PERSON.

203
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,833
WELL, NOT REALLY, BUT--

204
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:14,833
- WELL, I'LL-- GEE. ( sighs )
- RYOKO, YOU'RE ALIVE!

205
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,333
- YES, I GUESS I AM.

206
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,666
( strains )

207
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,458
NOW, WHAT THE HECK?

208
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:24,833
"GO HOME, YOU FOOL"?

209
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:28,250
OH, TO HELL WITH MAGICAL 
FORCE FIELDS AND GOBLINS.

210
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:30,208
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE, TENCHI.

211
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:32,125
- WHAT?

212
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:36,333
- HUH?

213
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:39,666
"STUPID"?

214
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,958
( growls )
SOMEBODY'S MOCKING ME.

215
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:44,333
COME OUT AND FACE ME.

216
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:45,833
( strains )

217
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:47,166
( gasps )

218
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,583
( grunts )

219
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:55,583
( grunting )

220
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:59,458
- ( screaming )
- ( grunting ) 

221
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:02,416
- ( meowing )

222
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,666
- Ayeka:
OH, THIS PLACE IS--

223
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,166
- OH NO.

224
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:08,333
AYEKA, THIS MUST BE THE PLACE
WHERE THE GOBLIN IS.

225
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:10,541
- ( whimpers )
- WE'RE GOING IN.

226
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:14,125
- BUT WHAT IF THE GOBLIN
HAS BEEN RESURRECTED?

227
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:16,875
- I'M NOT ABOUT TO LEAVE
RYOKO ALONE WITH TENCHI,

228
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,000
NOT IN THIS PLACE.

229
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:21,708
ABSOLUTELY NO WAY!

230
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:23,583
I CANNOT LET THAT HAPPEN!

231
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,125
I AM NOT
GOING TO ALLOW IT.

232
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:27,250
- YOU KNOW, SHE DOESN'T
REALLY SEEM TO CARE

233
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,791
ABOUT THE GOBLIN, DOES SHE?
- MM-MMM.

234
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:32,083
- Ryoko:
HIYAH! HA!

235
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:33,458
HIYAH!

236
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:44,541
- Tenchi: THIS IS WHERE
THE GOBLIN IS IMPRISONED.

237
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:47,416
- YEAH, RIGHT.
NO GOBLIN, NO NOTHING.

238
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,666
JUST ROCK.

239
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:53,083
- AH, THIS LOOKS 
LIKE A METEORITE.

240
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,875
HUH?

241
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,375
WHAT? HUH?

242
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:00,416
HUH?

243
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,916
WHAT? UH, HUH? WHAT?

244
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,041
WHAT'S THAT?

245
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:11,958
( swallows ) COULD THIS
BE THE GOBLIN?!

246
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:15,625
( nervous laughing )

247
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:17,083
IT COULDN'T BE.

248
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:18,250
HEY, RYOKO.

249
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,958
SHOULDN'T WE
GET GOING NOW?

250
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,125
( gulps )
- ( snickers )

251
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:24,291
COME BACK.

252
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:25,791
- GAA!

253
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:28,000
- THIS PLACE IS
NICE AND PRIVATE.

254
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,583
NOBODY'LL BOTHER US HERE.

255
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:35,916
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?
- LOOK AT ME, TENCHI.

256
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,833
- I THINK I'M GONNA
PASS ON THAT.

257
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:41,583
- COME ON NOW.

258
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:43,250
LOOK AT ME.
- I DON'T THINK SO.

259
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,000
- DON'T BE A PAIN, TENCHI.
- ( screams )

260
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,958
I THOUGHT WE CAME HERE
TO EXPLORE THE CAVE.

261
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:49,916
- HM-HMM.  AND WE DID.

262
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,375
- ( giggles )
- AHH!

263
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:53,875
- TENCHI!

264
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:56,666
- ( coughing )

265
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,333
- TENCHI!
- WHAT?

266
00:12:58,416 --> 00:12:59,916
- AYEKA.

267
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,583
- UH.
- OH BOY! WHAT NOW?

268
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:04,833
- UH-OH.

269
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:09,291
- LOOK WHO'S HERE.
WHAT'S UP NOW, PRINCESS?

270
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:12,458
- WHAT WERE YOU
DOING IN HERE?

271
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,708
- TRYING TO SEDUCE TENCHI.

272
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:16,833
- I KNEW SOMETHING
LIKE THIS WAS GOING ON.

273
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:19,916
YOU! YOU ARE SUCH A--
( stutters )

274
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,750
- YOU ARE ENVIOUS.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?!

275
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,041
- AYEKA, CALM DOWN.

276
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:28,708
- NO.  I CANNOT ALLOW HER
TO CONTINUE LIKE THIS, TENCHI.

277
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,583
THIS WOMAN NEEDS
TO BE DISCIPLINED,

278
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:32,416
OTHERWISE SHE'LL BECOME
EVEN MORE ARROGANT.

279
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,916
- YEAH, JUST HOW ARE YOU
GONNA DISCIPLINE ME, EXACTLY?

280
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,583
- ( both groan )

281
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:40,583
- ( gasps )

282
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:44,541
- AS A PRINCESS, I AM GIFTED
WITH BEAUTY, INTELLIGENCE,

283
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,708
AND LOTS OF POWER!

284
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:48,125
- ( grunts in pain )

285
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:52,208
( screams )

286
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:53,708
( groans )

287
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,166
- OOPS, WAS IT A BIT
TOO STRONG FOR YOU? 

288
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:59,041
OOH, I'M SORRY.
( laughs )

289
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:01,000
- THAT'S ENOUGH, PRINCESS.

290
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:02,708
YOU ARE SO OBNOXIOUS.

291
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,916
AN EYE FOR AN EYE!

292
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:10,000
- ( screams )

293
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,625
- ( laughing )

294
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:13,625
- THAT WAS NOT TOO FRIENDLY.

295
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:16,291
- I WAS JUST GETTING EVEN.

296
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:18,375
- DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THERE'S
A GOBLIN HERE.

297
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,583
- SURE DOESN'T.

298
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:22,583
- ( strains )
- ( groans ) 

299
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:24,041
- ( groans )

300
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:26,000
- ( both grunt )

301
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:27,833
- OH! OOH!
- ALL RIGHT.

302
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:30,625
- GET READY, AYEKA.

303
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:34,708
( strains )

304
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,750
- ( all gasping )

305
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,000
- UH, NO, WAIT.

306
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:42,500
- ( strains )

307
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,791
THAT'S HEAVY. 
- ( all sigh )

308
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:46,791
- ( giggles )

309
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:49,083
- TOO BADLY, YOU'LL GO
NOW THE GAME IS OVER. 

310
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:52,291
( cackles )

311
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:54,250
- HA! I CAN DO IT!

312
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:56,333
DON'T TAKE ME LIGHTLY, AYEKA!

313
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:01,416
- ( screaming )

314
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,291
- ( snickers )

315
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:07,000
TAKE THIS!

316
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:10,041
- WHOA!

317
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:13,458
- ( rumbling )

318
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,083
- AN EARTHQUAKE?

319
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:24,416
- ( all groan )

320
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,333
- ( screams )

321
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,583
- DO YOU LIKE THAT, PRINCESS?

322
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,333
- ( cracking )

323
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:33,416
- WHAT? AHH!

324
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:38,791
- OH NO, TENCHI,
COULD THIS BE?

325
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:41,000
- COULD IT BE THE GOBLIN?

326
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:43,166
- ( whimpers )

327
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,500
- ( screaming )

328
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:48,625
- OH DAMN.
IT'S CRUMBLING.

329
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,541
- YOU CAUSED ALL THIS,
YOU KNOW.

330
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:53,208
- HEY, WE'D BETTER
GET OUT OF HERE RIGHT NOW.

331
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:54,458
- HUH?
- ( laughs )

332
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:56,041
- ( screams )

333
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:00,791
- AYEKA.
AYEKA, COME QUICKLY.

334
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:03,208

OH TENCHI.

335
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:06,208
- OH, TENCHI, I'M SCARED.
- ARGH!

336
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:10,208
- AYEKA, DON'T TELL ME 
THAT I DIDN'T WARN YOU.

337
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:12,416
- YOU LEAVE
TENCHI ALONE, RYOKO!

338
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,125
 ( yelps )

339
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,041
- AYEKA, THIS WAY.

340
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:19,625
- STAY THERE
IF YOU WANT TO.

341
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:21,000
- TENCHI!

342
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,125
- ( screaming )

343
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:39,541
- WOW, THERE
REALLY IS A GOBLIN.

344
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:42,541
- THIS IS NOT THE TIME 
TO BE IMPRESSED SASAMI.

345
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:45,666
- HMM, WELL, I'M NOT 
AFRAID OF ANY GOBLIN.

346
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:48,083
SO EAT THIS, GOBLIN HEAD.

347
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,458
UH-OH, IT DOESN'T WORK.

348
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,250
HMM?

349
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,375
TENCHI?

350
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:00,625
LET'S GO.

351
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:02,708
- OH, RYOKO.  HUH?

352
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:04,625
- IT'S COMING TOWARD US.

353
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:07,458
- EVERYBODY RUN!
- ( screaming ) 

354
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:09,666
- AH HELP!

355
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,750
- ( screaming continues )

356
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,333
- HURRY! RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!

357
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:20,791
- ( screaming )

358
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,416
( all panting )

359
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,666
- ( grunts )

360
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:36,375
- AH! TENCHI!
- TENCHI!

361
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:37,958
- ( groans )

362
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:40,666
- TENCHI!

363
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,000
- TENCHI.

364
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:49,708
- HMM.

365
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:54,458
ALL RIGHT, YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH FUN
FOR ONE NIGHT, I THINK.

366
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:55,708
- GRANDPA?

367
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,958
- HMM, I DIDN'T THINK
YOU WOULD FIGURE OUT 

368
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,875
WHO I WAS SO EASILY.

369
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:08,750
- WHO THE HECK ARE YOU?
WHOA!

370
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:10,791
- ( giggles )

371
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:12,291
MY NAME IS WASHU...

372
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:15,708
THE GREATEST SCIENTIFIC
GENIUS OF THE UNIVERSE.

373
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:19,333
- YOU ARE WASHU.
YOU'RE THE GREATEST.

374
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:22,500
YOU ARE WASHU.
YOU'RE THE GENIUS.

375
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,875
WASHU! WASHU!
YOU'RE THE ONE!

376
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:27,250
HURRAY FOR WASHU!
- UHH.

377
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,333
WASHU? WASHU?

378
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:31,541
UH, I REMEMBER NOW.

379
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:34,916
YOU'RE THE MOST FAMOUS MAD
SCIENTIST IN THE UNIVERSE.

380
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,416
AHA, THE SCIENTIST THAT
WAS EXILED 700 YEARS AGO.

381
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:43,583
SO YOU FELL ONTO 
THIS PLANET, HUH?

382
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:46,666
- Grandpa: SOMEHOW, THE PEOPLE
IN THOSE DAYS KNEW INSTINCTIVELY

383
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:50,083
THAT THE METEORITE CONTAINED
SOMETHING EVIL.

384
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:53,166
THAT WAS WHY THEY BUILT
THE MASAKI SHRINE.

385
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,666
- Sasami: HMM, SO YOU
WERE THE GOBLIN

386
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,041
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT.

387
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:58,791
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

388
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:00,500
THERE'S NO GOBLIN
CUTE AS ME.

389
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:02,791
BUT ANYWAY,
WHICH ONE OF YOU

390
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,625
BROKE THE SEAL
AND RELEASED ME?

391
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:07,583
YOU SWUNG ME AROUND SO HARD
I THOUGHT THAT I WOULD DIE.

392
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:10,708
- ( groaning )

393
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:12,791
- HEY, WHAT'D I DO?

394
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:15,375
- HMM, YOU'LL BE
A WATER SPRITE

395
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:17,250
SO YOU CAN REFLECT
ON YOUR CONDUCT.

396
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:20,083
- ( muffled ) HEY.

397
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,916
RIBBIT.  RIBBIT.  RIBBIT.

398
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,041
- Both: WOW, SHE'S SO CUTE!

399
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,125
- I JUST REARRANGED HER GENES

400
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:32,708
AND ACCELERATED THE METABOLISM
OF HER CELLS.

401
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:35,250
WAY TOO EASY FOR 
A GENIUS LIKE ME.

402
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:37,500
I AM SUCH A GENIUS!
- RIBBIT, RIBBIT.

403
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:41,541
- WOW, I'M IMPRESSED, BUT WASN'T
IT KIND OF SILLY TO DO THAT?

404
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:43,208
- ( zapping )

405
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:45,625
- AHH!
- YOU CALLED ME SILLY.

406
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:50,083
- RIBBIT.  RIBBIT.  RIBBIT.
- RIBBIT.  ( grunts )

407
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:51,791
- Both: SO ADORABLE!

408
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:53,666
- ( laughs )

409
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,708
THAT'LL TEACH HER
TO CALL ME SILLY.

410
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:57,750
- INCREDIBLE.
- HMM?

411
00:19:57,833 --> 00:20:00,125
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU'RE VERY POWERFUL.

412
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:01,250
PLEASE FORGIVE THEM.

413
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,541
- HMM?

414
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:05,750
YOU'RE INTERESTING.

415
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:07,458
VERY.

416
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:08,458
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

417
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,166
- HUH? TENCHI.
TENCHI MASAKI.

418
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,583
- TENCHI, HUH?

419
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:15,875
AND YOU MUST CALL ME
LITTLE WASHU, OKAY? 

420
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:18,875
- UH, ALL RIGHT.

421
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:21,625
- LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE ANOTHER 
PRETTY LADY IN OUR HOUSEHOLD.

422
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:23,125
( chuckles )
YOU SHOULD BE HAPPY, TENCHI.

423
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,625
- ( both laugh )
- ( Tenchi sighs )

424
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,375
- RIBBIT.

425
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:28,958
- EH RIBBIT!

426
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:35,916
- HUH, LOOK WHAT HAPPENED
TO THIS STORAGE UNIT.

427
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,416
- SHE'S REALLY
MADE HERSELF AT HOME.

428
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,083
- ( yawns )

429
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:47,625
I MUST BE A LITTLE RUSTY
AFTER 700 YEARS OF IMPRISONMENT.

430
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:50,333
I BETTER WORK ON AN INVENTION
OR SOMETHING

431
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,958
TO GET MYSELF GOING AGAIN.

432
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:53,833
- ( beeping )

433
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:55,000
- ( crackles )

434
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,500
- ( sighs )

435
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:04,125
- SO THEN THAT LEGEND
ABOUT THE GOBLIN...

436
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:07,958
- SEEMS IT WAS
A TRUE STORY AFTER ALL.

437
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:09,875
- TENCHI, I'M TELLING YOU,

438
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:12,000
SHE'S EVEN WORSE
THAN A GOBLIN.

439
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:14,375
- ( laughs )

DETECTIVE JOINS US

464
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:19,250
AS KIYONE ARRIVES ON EARTH
IN SEARCH OF MIHOSHI.

465
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:21,416
BUT WHY DOESN'T KIYONE
LOOK SO ENTHUSIASTIC

466
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,166
WHEN SHE SEES HER
MISSING PARTNER? 

467
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:25,958
- Mihoshi: OH, KIYONE,
LONG TIME NO SEE.

468
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:28,666
YOU SEE, WE HAD THE BEST
PARTNERSHIP IN GALAXY POLICE.

469
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,833
I KNEW YOU WOULD
COME FOR ME KIYONE.

470
00:23:30,916 --> 00:23:32,916
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE A GOOD
PARTNERSHIP, DON'T YOU AGREE?
