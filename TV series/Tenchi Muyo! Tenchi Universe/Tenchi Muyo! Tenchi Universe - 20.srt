00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:20,791
A NICE RELAXING TIME.

A SHINY PEARL ON THE BEACH

33
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:32,083
OR A BEAUTIFUL CORAL
ON THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN.

IN THE SUN TOO LONG.

35

00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:47,833

58
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:16,208
WE CAN'T EVEN PAY
YAGAMI'S DOCKING FEE.

59
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:19,208

- AW, AND I THOUGHT
WE HAD A CUSTOMER.

66
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,291
- WE SET UP THIS SNACK SHOP ON
THE BEACH, IT'S THE SUMMERTIME,

67
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:40,833
WHY DIDN'T YOU GET ANY ICE?

68
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:42,458
- WELL, I JUST DON'T
UNDERSTAND IT.

OF COURSE I GOT ICE.

70
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:46,000

WHY WE DON'T HAVE ANY.

71
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:48,958
- WOW, IT'S HOT,

PART-TIME JOB.

96
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:24,166
- HEY, YOU KIDS OVER THERE!
YOU SHOULDN'T GO INTO THAT AREA!

97
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,791
IT'S DANGEROUS!

- SASAMI, DID YOU HEAR THAT?
- I DID, I DID!

118
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:27,166
- HE SAID THE WINNER WILL
TAKE HOME ONE MILLION JURAI.

119
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,208
- YEAH, THAT'S WHAT HE SAID,

120
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:31,333
BUT YOU ONLY GET THE
MILLION IF YOU WIN.

121
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:34,666
- WELL, DON'T YOU WORRY, TENCHI.
IF WE ALL ENTER THE CONTEST

122
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,333
ONE OF US
SHOULD BE ABLE TO WIN.

123
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:38,750

124
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,833

129
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:57,708
DON'T ENTER A CONTEST YOU HAVE
NO CHANCE OF WINNING, AYEKA.

130
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:59,250
- ( both growl )

131
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:02,375
- RYOKO, THIS LOOKS LIKE THE
ABSOLUTELY PERFECT OPPORTUNITY

132
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:04,875
FOR US TO SETTLE OUR DIFFERENCES

133
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:06,458
NOW WOULDN'T YOU
AGREE WITH THAT?

134
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:07,875

140
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:28,708
HUH?

141

142
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:40,500

150
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:01,541
- HEY, I'M NOT FAT, KIYONE!

151
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,458
- YOU KNOW WHAT? I WISH I

152
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,208
- HEY, CAN I GET

153
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:18,750

157
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,375
- WELL, USING A SNACK SHOP AS
YOUR HIDEOUT WAS CLEVER, RYOKO.

158
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:34,125
- I'M GLAD YOU THINK SO.
- I MIGHT ADD, HOWEVER,

159
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:37,250
GETTING YOURSELF INVOLVED WITH
THE PROBLEMS OF PLANET JURAI

160
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:40,416
WAS NOT SO CLEVER.
- HEY, NOW YOU LISTEN TO ME!

161
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,291
THAT WASN'T MY CHOICE.
- I'LL GIVE YOU A CHOICE, RYOKO.

162
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,791
I CHALLENGE YOU

176
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:41,583
I ALREADY CHALLENGED AYEKA
TO THIS SWIMSUIT CONTEST.

177
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,833
- AFTER I'M DONE WITH HER,

178
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:45,875
I WILL ACCEPT YOUR
CHALLENGE, NAGI.

179
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:49,291
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
GIVE ME A LITTLE WHILE?

180

JUST ONE MORE THING, RYOKO.

183
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:05,208
- HMM?

184
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:07,458
UNTIL WE HAVE A CHANCE
TO FIGHT, OKAY?

185
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,708
- NO PROBLEM!
NOBODY'S GONNA BEAT ME!

186
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:13,791
NOT WITH THIS SWIMSUIT!

233
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,041
I'M REALLY IMPRESSED.

234
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:03,208
- WELL, A LOT OF PEOPLE
AGREE WITH YOU.

235
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:05,666
- THE ONLY DIFFERENCE I CAN
SEE IS THAT THE PRINCESS

236
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,083
IS JUST A LITTLE MORE GRACEFUL.

237
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:09,333
- OH REALLY?
IS THAT RIGHT?

238
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:12,250
BUT I GUESS
THAT'S YOUR OPINION.

239
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,041

242
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:42,583

243
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:45,541

244
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:49,458
- AND SHE REALLY IS
A MIRROR IMAGE OF RYOKO.

245
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:51,291
- WHOO-HOO!
- THIS IS AMAZING.

246
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:53,541
YOUR RESEMBLANCE TO RYOKO
IS REALLY STRIKING.

247
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,583
- OH, I'M VERY FLATTERED
THAT YOU THINK I LOOK

248
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:56,958
LIKE SUCH A BEAUTIFUL LADY.

249
00:14:57,041 --> 00:15:00,125
- ENTRY NUMBER ONE WAS
A PRINCESS AYEKA LOOKALIKE.

250
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:02,833
AND NOW YOU, HOW DID YOU GET
THE IDEA TO IMPERSONATE

251
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,458
SUCH A VILLAINOUS DUO ANYWAY?

252
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:07,125
- WELL, YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO
DISAGREE. I DON'T THINK RYOKO

253
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:09,541
IS SUCH A BAD PERSON.
- REALLY?

254
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:10,958
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

255
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:12,791
- PRINCESS AYEKA
IS THE EVIL ONE.

256
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:15,333
( tearfully ) AND THAT POOR
HELPLESS RYOKO

257
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:17,958
IS JUST BEING FORCED
TO GO ALONG WITH HER.

258
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:19,166
- OH?

259
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,041
- THAT'S THE FIRST TIME
I'VE HEARD OF THAT.

260
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:23,000
- ( thunder crashes )
- OHHHH.

261
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:26,125
- AND NOW FOR MY PERSONAL
TURN-ONS, I LOVE SLEEPING LATE,

262
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,708
DRINKING EARLY AND TAKING
A BATH IN THE MORNING.

263
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:30,000
GIMME THAT THING!
- WHAT?

264
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:34,333
- SHE LOVES SLEEPING,
DRINKING

265
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:37,000
AND BATHING.
- UH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

266
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:39,708
NOW YOU CAN GO WAIT IN THAT BOX
BEHIND US, OKAY?

267
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,375
WELL, LET'S BRING OUT
OUR NEXT CONTESTANT.

268
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:51,500
- WHOA, I GOTTA SAY SHE'S PRETTY
CUTE. WHAT DO YOU THINK?

269
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:54,375
- SHE REMINDS ME OF MY WIFE
WHEN SHE WAS YOUNGER.

270
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,375
- MEOW.

271
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,166
- WOW.
- SHE'S FIGHTING LITTLE THING.

272
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:10,041
- MM, LOOKS LIKE
A REAL TOUGH CALL.

273
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:13,208
- YES, IT LOOKS BAD.
THERE'S A LOT OF COMPETITION.

274
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:14,458
- HEY, IT'S KIYONE'S TURN!

275
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,583

276
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:20,458

277
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:21,416
- OH?

278
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:26,000

279
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:29,500
- AND THE CROWD IS GOING WILD.
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS?

280
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,750
- I THINK THEY LIKE
THAT FARMER'S TAN

281
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,041
SHE HAS FROM
WORKING OUTSIDE.

282
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,000
IT MAKES THE AUDIENCE FEEL
SHE'S DOWN TO EARTH.

283
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:37,458
- SO HAVING A SUNBURN
IS PART OF A NEW TREND?

284
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:38,791
- EXACTLY.

285
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:41,083
- SO YOU THINK KIYONE HAS A
CHANCE TO WIN THEN?

286
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,916
- OF COURSE SHE DOES.
- THANK YOU!

287
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,708
- DANG, IT'S HARD TO PICK.

288
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:48,375
- AS OUR PARADE OF CONTESTANTS

289
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:51,458
LET'S BRING OUT OUR FINAL

NOW IS THAT HER SCORE FOR POISE

296
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:12,750
IS GONNA BE LOW.

297
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:15,708
I THINK SHE MAY GET A LOT
OF SYMPATHY POINTS.

298
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:18,875

- I'M PARTICIPATING
IN THIS CONTEST TOO.

303
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,916

305
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:38,833
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING HERE?

306
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:41,083
- AHH.

307
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:45,000
I COULDN'T PASS UP AN
OPPORTUNITY TO COMPETE WITH YOU.

308
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:48,083
THIS CONTEST WILL PSYCH ME UP
FOR OUR DUEL, RYOKO.

309
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:50,625
- I THINK WE SHOULD
LET HER.

310
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:52,458
MM-HMM.

311
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:54,541
- THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED
TO ALLOW HER TO COMPETE.

312
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,625
LET'S SEE WHAT
WE'VE GOT HERE.

313
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,333
- OKAY.

314
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:00,458
- All: WOW!

315
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:11,583
- OOF, NOW THAT WOMAN HAS
REALLY GOT SOMETHING.

316
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,291
- NOT BAD.

317
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,916
- MEOW.
- CIAOU.

318
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,208
- CIAOU.
- MEOW!

319
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,375
- ( drumroll )

320
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,875
- AND NOW, THE MOMENT
YOU'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR.

321
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:41,708
- ( whimpers )

322
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,083
- UHHHH.

323
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:47,541
- JUDGES, PLEASE PUSH
YOUR BUTTONS.

324
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:52,750
THE WINNER IS
NAGI THE BOUNTY HUNTER!

325
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:56,041
- ( cheering ) 
- NO, I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS!

326
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:59,250
- ( sighs )

327
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:04,958
- DIG IT, PEOPLE.
I'M THE WINNER.

328
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:08,166
NOW, RYOKO, LET'S YOU AND I
GET DOWN TO BUSINESS!

329
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,875
WHERE IS SHE?
AHHH!

330
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:13,250
- ( grunts ) UH?
- ( whirring )

331
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:26,166
- HUH, I DON'T BELIEVE
THOSE STUPID JUDGES!

332
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,958
- HEY, I HAVEN'T COMPLETED
THE REPAIR WORK, YOU KNOW?

333
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:31,375
- WE HAVE AN EMBARRASSING
SITUATION HERE.

334
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:34,333
IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE HAS STOLEN
OUR MILLION JURAI PRIZE MONEY.

335
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,375
- Ryoko: I'LL JUST
GO ON AHEAD, TENCHI.

336
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,875
- ( screaming )

337
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:50,416
- OH.
- THERE SHE GOES.

338
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,541
- MEOW.

339
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,833
- RYO-OHKI.
- MEOW!

340
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:58,750
- I'VE GOT AN IDEA.
- MEOW!

341
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:01,250
- THIS IS OUR LAST RESORT.
- MEOW!

342
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:17,916
- RYO-OHKI, COME ON,
LET'S GET THE OTHERS!

343
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,625
- MEOW-OWWWW!

344
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:22,333
- HUH?

345
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:29,583
- ( yelping, moaning )

346
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:33,208
- ( all grunt )

347
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:35,166
- MEOW-OWWWW!

348
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:40,125
- HEY, YOU COWARD!
COME BA-AAAACK!

349
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:42,041

350
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:44,291
- MEOW!

351
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:56,416
- Tenchi: LOOK WHAT
YOU'VE DONE NOW, RYOKO!

352
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,125
- YEAH, WELL, I SHOULD HAVE
WON THAT CONTEST ANYWAY.

353
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:01,875
- SO THE WAY I SEE IT IS
THE AWARD IS RIGHTFULLY MINE.

354
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:04,000
- YOU'VE GOT SOME NERVE!

355
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:05,708
I WAS MOST SUITED TO WIN
THE GRAND PRIZE

356
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:09,125
SO THE WAY I SEE IT IS
THIS IS MY MONEY.

357
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:12,708
- NO, IT'S MINE.
- NO, IT'S MINE!

358
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:14,583
- ( growling )
- I SAID IT'S MINE!

359
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:16,541
- GIMME THAT MONEY,
GIVE IT TO ME.

360
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18,041
- IF THERE'S EVER A COMPETITION,

361
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:19,625
I'LL BE THE WINNER, JUST
TRUST ME ON THAT.

362
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:22,125
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME? YOU
WOULDN'T HAVE EVEN BEEN THIRD.

363
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:23,708
- OH, GIVE ME
THAT MONEY, IT'S MINE!

364
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:26,208

- LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
NOW WE CAN SEE ON OUR RIGHT

391
00:23:25,041 --> 00:23:27,250
THE CHECKPOINT SATELLITE
OF PLANET JURAI.

392
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:29,958
NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO ENTER
INTO JURAI'S TERRITORY

393
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:31,916
WITHOUT GOING THROUGH
IMMIGRATION PROCEDURES

394
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,250
ON THIS SATELLITE.

395
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:36,250
PLEASE BE ADVISED
NOT TO ACT SUSPICIOUS, EVERYONE.

396
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:38,750
- Tenchi: FINALLY WE ARE
AT THE GATE OF PLANET JURAI.

397
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:40,833
ONLY TO FIND THE ENEMY
FORCE IN CONTROL OF IT,

398
00:23:40,916 --> 00:23:42,083
LOOKING OUT FOR US!

399
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:44,541
COMING UP NEXT IS "NO NEED
FOR A CHECKPOINT."

400
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:47,333
WELL, THIS IS GOING TO BE
A TOUGH BRIDGE TO CROSS.

401
00:23:47,416 --> 00:23:49,541
- IT'S UNQUESTIONABLY
A BIG HURDLE.
