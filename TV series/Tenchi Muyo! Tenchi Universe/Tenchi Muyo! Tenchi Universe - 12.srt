- SONIA... 

29
00:02:00,916 --> 00:02:03,208
- LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
WE NOW PRESENT FOR YOU 

30
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:05,750
A SPECIAL TENCHI MUYO EVENT.

31
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:08,000
- THE DIMENSIONAL
CAUSE-AND-EFFECT CONTROLLER--

32
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:10,208
A GREAT INVENTION
BY PROFESSOR WASHU--

33
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:13,000
IS A DEVICE THAT CONTROLS
THE SEQUENCE OF TIME AND SPACE.

34
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:15,625
IT CAN CHANGE THE WORLD
IN ANY WAY THAT YOU WANT.

35
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:17,666
BUT WHEN THIS DEVICE
IS DRIVEN OUT OF CONTROL,

36
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,208
WELL...

37
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:21,041
- TENCHI AND COMPANY
HAVE BEEN THROWN

38
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:23,541
INTO AND BEYOND
THEIR TIME AND SPACE

39
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:26,125
TO WANDER ABOUT
CHAOTIC WORLDS.

40
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:28,208
- WE'RE CERTAIN 
YOU'RE WONDERING

41
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:31,125
JUST WHAT KIND OF WORLD
AWAITS US THIS TIME.

42
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:33,666
- YOU DON'T HAVE
TO PAY ADMISSION

43
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,625
UNTIL YOU FINISH
WATCHING THIS SHOW.

44
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:37,291
- YO!

45
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:43,541
- ( ship's horn blows )

46
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:46,666
- ( motor whirrs )

47
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:50,875
- HOW MANY YEARS HAVE PASSED
SINCE I GAVE UP EVERYTHING

48
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:53,000
AS A POLICE DETECTIVE

49
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:56,083
AND LEFT ON THIS
ENDLESS JOURNEY?

50
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:59,583
I'D BE LYING IF I SAID
I HAD NO REGRETS.

51
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:00,708
BUT I HAD NO OTHER CHOICE

52
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:02,666
IN ORDER TO ESCAPE
FROM THAT NIGHTMARE,

53
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,375
THE DAYS AFTER ALL HOPES
FOR A PROMOTION

54
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:07,458
AND MY CAREER
HAD BEEN COMPLETE.

55
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:15,416
I WANDERED FAR
AND FINALLY ARRIVED

56
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,416
AT THIS PORT TOWN
AT THE END OF THE WORLD.

57
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,541
BUT SOMEHOW, I FEEL
THIS STRANGE TOWN HAS

58
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:24,125
IN SOME WAY
FILLED MY WOUNDS.

59
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:39,583
- HELLO, THERE.

60
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:46,166
WHAT'LL YOU HAVE, HUH?

61
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:54,291
- UH, NORTH COUNTRY NOODLES.

62
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:57,041
- ALL RIGHT, ONE
NORTH COUNTRY NOODLES IT IS.

63
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:58,750
- ARE YOU TRAVELLING ALONE?

64
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,125
- WELL, SORT OF.

65
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:02,208
- OH HOW NICE
TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT.

66
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:05,458
BUT WHY IN THIS LITTLE TOWN?

67
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:08,583
BECAUSE THERE IS REALLY NOTHING
TO SEE AROUND HERE, YOU KNOW?

68
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:09,958
- WELL--

69
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,125
- MAYBE YOU HAVE SOME SECRET
STORY TO TELL US, HUH?

70
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:14,541
- AYEKA, NOW, YOU
SHOULDN'T BE PRYING.

71
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:17,250
- OH, IT'S ALL RIGHT.

72
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:19,291
- I WOULDN'T BE
SURPRISED IF YOU DID.

73
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,000
I WOULD NEVER HAVE
COME TO THIS TOWN 

74
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:23,250
IF I HADN'T HAD A STORY MYSELF.

75
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:26,500
- AH, WELL,
THERE SHE GOES AGAIN.

76
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,666
- HA, HERE YOU ARE AGAIN.

77
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,916
AYEKA, YOU SHOULDN'T BE
LOITERING HERE LIKE THIS.

78
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,166
WE HAVE OUR OWN DINER TO OPEN,
YOU KNOW.

79
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,833
- I KNOW, I KNOW.

80
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:38,125
- YEAH, IT'S HARD ON YOU,
ISN'T IT, SASAMI?

81
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:39,750
- ( giggles )

82
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:43,500
- HERE YOU ARE,
NORTH COUNTRY NOODLES.

83
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,250
- WOW.

84
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,791
( blows lightly )

85
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:58,166
( slurps )
DELICIOUS.

86
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,666
- SO TELL ME, ARE YOU PLANNING
ON STAYING IN TOWN FOR A WHILE?

87
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:05,083
- I GUESS.  IT LOOKS LIKE
A NICE PLACE TO LIVE.

88
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:08,458
- YEAH, IT'S A VERY NICE TOWN.

89
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,708
- I WONDER,

90
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:12,916
DO YOU THINK I COULD GET SOME
KIND OF JOB AROUND HERE?

91
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,500
- OH, I SEE.
SO YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A JOB.

92
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,375
- YOU SHOULD COME 
WORK AT OUR PLACE.

93
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:19,041
- HUH?

94
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:21,541
- OH YES, THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

95
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,875
YOU KNOW WE RUN A TAVERN
NOT FAR FROM HERE.

96
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:26,541
IT'S A SMALL PLACE FOR LOCAL
FISHERMEN TO EAT AND DRINK IN.

97
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,625
BUT WE CERTAINLY
COULD USE THE HELP.

98
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:30,083
- THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

99
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:32,041
- YEAH, COME ON. COME
WORK WITH US.

100
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:35,875
- WELL, IF IT'S NOT AN
IMPOSITION, I'D BE GLAD TO.

101
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:37,250
- YAY!

102

GO ON.
DRINK IT UP, YOUNG FELLA.

106
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:55,083
YOU GO ON AHEAD NOW.

107
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:57,083

108
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:58,916

THANKS FOR WAITING.
HERE YOU ARE.

114
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:11,583
- Ryoko: OH GOODIE,
MORE SAKE.

115
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:13,833
- I'D LIKE SOME GRILLED FISH

116
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,416

120
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:23,041
- THANK YOU.  YES.

121
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:26,041
- I HEARD YOU USED TO
BE A POLICE DETECTIVE.

122
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:27,625
- OH, WERE YOU REALLY?

123
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:29,791
- YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT, OLD MAN?

124
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:32,500
( gulping )

125
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:33,583
AAH.

126
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:35,875
- IT'S A LONG TIME AGO,

127
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:37,958
A LONG TIME.

128
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:43,000
- WELL, I SURE AM GLAD TO
HAVE A SWEETHEART LIKE YOU

129
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:44,208

130
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:45,583
- THANKS.

131
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:48,750
- YES, BUT I'M THE SWEETHEART
OF TENCHI.

132
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:50,333
- HEY! WAIT A MINUTE!

133
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:51,708
WHO DID YOU SAY WAS 
TENCHI'S SWEETHEART?

134
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:53,958
- ME, HERE.
THAT'S ME. 

135
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:56,125
- WHAT YOU ARE IS RUDE,
AND IMPERTINENT,

136
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,291
AND A DRUNKARD.

137
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,750
- HUH?!

138
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:01,958
HOW DARE YOU SAY SUCH
A THING TO YOUR CUSTOMER.

139
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:04,458
- WHAT KIND OF A CUSTOMER
ARE YOU, ANYWAY?

140
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:06,416
PAY UP YOUR TAB FIRST
AND THEN SAY WHAT YOU LIKE.

141
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,166
- TENCHI,
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

142
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,458
I THINK AYEKA'S
ENVIOUS OF US. 

143
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:11,666
THAT'S WHAT I THINK.

144
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,166
- ( growling )

145
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,708
- ( laughing )

146
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:17,166
- STOP IT, SIS, STOP IT.
- I'LL SHOW YOU!

147
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,250

- TAKE THAT!

148
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:20,500

- OH, HEY!

149
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:22,833
GIVE ME THAT PAN.
- OOH, I CAN'T STAND IT.

150
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:26,291
- ( Kiyone's thoughts ):
A FUN PLACE WITH FUN PEOPLE.

151
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:27,833
- ( arguing continues )

152
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:29,541
- ( Kiyone's thoughts ):
FOR SO MANY YEARS,

153
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:32,000
MY HEART HAS BEEN FROZEN.
- GOOD MORNING.

154
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:34,500
- THESE PEOPLE IN THIS TOWN
ARE SO KIND

155
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:35,791
- I'M LEAVING FOR SCHOOL.

156
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:37,291
- THAT I CAN FEEL MY HEART
STARTING TO THAW...

157
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:39,166
- GOOD MORNING.
- SLOWLY BUT SURELY,

158
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,958
CUDDLED IN THE WARMTH
OF THEIR HEARTS.

159
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:48,333
- MISS KIYONE.
- HI, SASAMI. 

160
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:49,500
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

161
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:51,166
ARE YOU BACK
FROM SCHOOL ALREADY?

162
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,666
- YEAH.

163
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,791
YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING THE OCEAN
AGAIN, MISS KIYONE?

164
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:56,166
- YES.

165
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,875
- YOU LIKE THE OCEAN?

166
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,583
- I'VE GROWN TO LIKE IT.

167
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:01,666
AND SINCE I CAME HERE--

168
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,125
IT'S TIME TO GO 
OPEN THE TAVERN.

169
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:06,541
- RIGHT.
( giggles )

170
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:09,583
- I'LL WORK HARD.
- LET'S GO.  COME ON.

171
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:11,333
- ( giggles )
- ( laughing )

172
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:13,541
- Nobuyuki: HEY, OKAY!
- Ryoko: COME ON, FOLKS.

173
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:16,000
BRING US MORE SAKE.
MORE, MORE.

174
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:17,833
MORE!
- AND MORE AND MORE.

175
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:19,750
HOW DARE YOU!
YOU HAVEN'T PAID A CENT.

176
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,833
- ( Kiyone's thoughts ):
A PEACEFUL LIFE

177
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:24,000
IN A SMALL TOWN--

178
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:26,375
I DON'T HAVE TO LOOK BACK
TO THE PAST ANYMORE.

179
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:30,875
YES, THE NIGHTMARE IS OVER
NEVER TO RETURN.

180
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,166
- OH, WELCOME TO--

181
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,666
( gasps )

182
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,875
- KIYONE.

183
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,333
- ( gasps )

184
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:44,833
- OH, I LOOKED
EVERYWHERE, KIYONE.

185
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:47,083
- MI-- MI-- MIHOSHI?

186
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:49,875
- SOMEONE TOLD ME
THAT THEY SAW YOU HERE.

187
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:51,333
- OH, WHEN I HEARD THAT,

188
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:53,833
I RUSHED HERE AS
FAST AS I COULD.

189
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:56,291
- ( gasping )

190
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:58,916
- I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU
FOR SUCH A LONG TIME, YOU KNOW.

191
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,083
I'VE BEEN LOOKING EVER SINCE
YOU DISAPPEARED, KIYONE.

192
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,250
( crying )

193
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,083
I MISSED YOU, KIYONE.

194
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:06,458
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH.

195
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:08,916
- All: OH.

196
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,666
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

197
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,125
WHY DID YOU DISAPPEAR
ALL OF A SUDDEN, KIYONE?

198
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:15,208
OH, I MISSED YOU SO MUCH.

199
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:17,375
OH, I HAVE NEWS FOR YOU.

200
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,458
YOU KNOW, I WAS APPOINTED
TO THE TOP POSITION

201
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:21,416
AT THE OKAYAMA POLICE.
- ( gasps )

202
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,291
- LET'S GO HOME NOW

203
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:25,166
AND WE'LL FIGHT CRIME TOGETHER

204
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,875
JUST LIKE BACK IN 
THE GOOD OLD DAYS.

205
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,458
COME ON, KIYONE.

206
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:32,166
- JUST A MINUTE, PLEASE.

207
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,083
I DON'T HAVE A CLUE
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE,

208
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:35,708
BUT I'D LIKE YOU TO KNOW
THAT MISS KIYONE

209
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,625
IS WORKING FOR US
AT THIS PLACE NOW.

210
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:39,166
- HUH?
- YES, THAT'S RIGHT.

211
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,958
MISS KIYONE'S LIKE A MEMBER
OF OUR FAMILY NOW.

212
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:43,958
- OH, REALLY? 
IS THAT RIGHT?

213
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,625
- AH, YES, THAT'S RIGHT.

214
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,625
- WELL, I GUESS I'LL JUST
WORK HERE TOO THEN,

215
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,000
TOGETHER WITH HER.

216
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:52,458
THAT'S RIGHT, BECAUSE
WE TWO ARE PARTNERS FOREVER.

217
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:55,541
( echoes ) WE TWO ARE
PARTNERS FOREVER.

218
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,625
- WE TWO ARE PARTNERS FOREVER.

219
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:59,166
- ( screams )

220
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:01,416
- OH NO, WAIT.

221
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,541
WHERE ARE YOU GOING, KIYONE?

222
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:05,375
KIYONE!

223
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:07,208
- WHEW.

224
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:09,875
IT LOOKS LIKE AN EVEN HARDER JOB
THAN I EXPECTED.

225
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:11,625
- ( train whistles )

226
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:17,125
- ( Kiyone's thoughts ): MY
PEACEFUL LIFE IN THE PORT TOWN,

227
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:20,500
IT TURNED OUT TO BE
A MOMENTARY DREAM. 

228
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:24,666
WHEN WILL I BE RELEASED
FROM THIS NIGHTMARE?

229
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:29,500
( sighs ) THIS NIGHTMARE
NAMED MIHOSHI.

230
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:31,000
- CANCEL.

231
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:32,666
THERE WE GO.

232
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,625
- ( train whistles )

233
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:44,083
- ( sighs )
- GOOD MORNING,

234
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:46,041
STUDENT COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN.

235
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:47,750
- OH, GOOD MORNING.

236
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:51,958
- ( scoffs )

237
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:54,250
- HOW UNUSUAL FOR YOU,
MISS RYOKO,

238
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:55,916
NOT TO BE LATE
FOR SCHOOL TODAY.

239
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:00,458
- OH MAN, WHAT I LOUSY WAY
OF STARTING A DAY.

240
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:03,375
I KNEW WHEN I WOKE UP,
IT WAS GONNA BE A BAD ONE.

241
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:05,458
- ( both growl )

242
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:07,166
- GIRLS, GOOD MORNING.

243
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,708

244
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:10,375
GOOD MORNING TO YOU, TENCHI.

245
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:12,125
HMM? 
HMPH.

246
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:13,875
- HUH?

247
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:24,291
- ( school bell rings )

248
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:28,500
- YO!

249
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:34,291
YO!

250
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:38,625

252
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,166
( panting )
UH, I'M LATE.

253
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,958
LATE!

254
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,083
AH!

255
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:54,416
OH NO.

256
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,958
LATE!

257
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:57,958
- WELL, NOW.

258
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,166
- ( clattering )

259
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,875
- HUH?

260
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:02,833
- OWW, THAT HURTS.

261
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:05,208
- YOU'RE LATE AGAIN, MIHOSHI.

262
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,416
- I'M SORRY, MISS KIYONE.

263
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,625
- REALLY, MIHOSHI, WHAT KIND
OF TEACHER DO YOU EXPECT TO BE

264
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:12,083
WHEN YOU'RE LATE FOR SCHOOL
EVERY DAY?

265
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:15,458
I'M SO EXASPERATED,
I CAN'T EVEN TALK ABOUT IT.

266
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:17,708
- OH, PLEASE,
DON'T BE THAT WAY.

267
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,541
DON'T ABANDON ME,
MISS KIYONE, PLEASE.

268
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:23,041
- I WOULD HAVE ABANDONED YOU
A LONG TIME AGO

269
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,625
IF I COULD HAVE.
- ( bell rings )

270
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:26,041
- PLEASE, PLEASE.
- OH NO.

271
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:27,791
OF COURSE MY CLASS
IS STARTING.

272
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:29,250
- OOPS, MINE TOO.

273
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,166
( yawns )

274
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:40,500
WELL, NEXT IS
UJI SHUI'S STORY VOLUME FOUR.

275
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:43,833
IN THIS STORY ABOUT THE DEMON
AT RASHOMON,

276
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:45,500
THE DEMON AND A WARRIOR

277
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:48,333
CREATE A TRIANGLE RELATIONSHIP
WITH A PRINCESS.

278
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:52,208
AND THEN THE MOST UN-HONORABLE
THINGS START TO HAPPEN.

279
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:54,500
( thoughts ): I SHOULDN'T
BE DOZING OFF LIKE THIS.

280
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:58,250
NO, NOT ME, THE RESPECTABLE
CHAIRMAMN OF THE STUDENT BODY

281
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,833
WHO SHOULD BE THE ROLE MODEL FOR
EVERY STUDENT IN THIS SCHOOL.

282
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:05,041
BUT THEN THIS CLASS MAKES ME
SO DEMONICALLY SLEEPY.

283
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:07,375
- ( snickering )
- HUH?

284
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:10,083
HOW COULD SHE BE AWAKE?

285
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,458
SHE MUST BE EATING
OR SOMETHING.

286
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,416
- THIS IS MY FAVORITE CLASS.

287
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,750
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING, RYOKO?!

288
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:19,541
- HUH, WELL, I'M HAVING
MY EARLY LUNCH.

289
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:20,916
- YEAH, RIGHT.

290
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,208
AND SINCE WHEN DOES 
A HIGH SCHOOL GIRL'S

291
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:24,375
EARLY LUNCH INCLUDE SAKE, HUH?

292
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:26,333
- WELL, SINCE TODAY, I GUESS.

293
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:29,041
( laughs )
- ( grumbles )

294
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:31,375
I JUST CANNOT BELIEVE YOU!
- ( mutters sleepily )

295
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:33,250
- IT'S SO DISRESPECTFUL!
- WHAT?

296
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,791
- YOU ARE RUDE!
- HEY, YOU TWO GIRLS, THERE.

297
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,708
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE QUIET
OR I'M GONNA GET ANGRY, I GUESS.

298
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:40,375
- YES, GO ON. SAY SOMETHING
TO HER, MISS MIHOSHI.

299
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:43,041
- ( pants ) MISS RYOKO!

300
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:45,000
- YOU WANT SOME TOO? HERE.

301
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:47,583
- OH, GREAT, THANKS.
- MISS MIHOSHI!

302
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:51,875
- ( gasps ) MISS RYOKO,
YOU MAY NOT DRINK SAKE IN CLASS,

303
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,125
YOU KNOW?
- THAT'S RIGHT.

304
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:55,666
- THAT'S RIGHT.
SEE, IF YOU WANT TO DRINK SAKE,

305
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,500
WAIT TILL YOU GO HOME
AND HAVE SOME WITH YOUR DINNER.

306
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:58,958
- THAT'S NOT RIGHT!

307
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:01,208
- HEY, NOW, NO NEED TO BE
SO UPTIGHT, MISS.

308
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:03,583
JUST HAVE A SIP AS A TOKEN
OF OUR FRIENDSHIP.

309
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:07,125
- UH, OKAY.
THAT'S VERY KIND OF YOU, RYOKO.

310
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:09,708
- JUST WHAT IS WRONG
WITH YOU TWO?!

311
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:26,833
- TENCHI, CATCH IT.

312
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:28,250
- UGH.

313
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:33,166
- ( yowling )

314
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,500
- NOW WHERE IS IT?

315
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,083
HMM.

316
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:40,916
HMM.

317
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,166
OH HERE IT IS.

318
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,875
BUT HOW COME THERE ARE
TWO OF THEM?

319
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:49,125
OH!
- ( meows )

320
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,958
- HMM, IS THIS A CAT
OR WHAT?

321
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:54,041
OH, YOU'RE HURT.
AREN'T YOU, LITTLE GUY?

322
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:56,291
- ( meows pitifully )
- JUST A SECOND NOW. 

323
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:02,250
WELL, HOW'S THAT?
- ( happy meow ) 

324
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:03,958
- OH, AHA!

325
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:06,208
SO HERE YOU ARE, RYO-OHKI.

326
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:08,666
- ( meowing )

327
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,125
- ( giggles )

328
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:12,750
I LOOKED EVERYWHERE FOR YOU.

329
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:14,791
- ( meows )

330
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:16,458
- WHAT'S WITH
THIS HANDKERCHIEF?

331
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:20,083
OH, I SEE NOW.
DID YOU TAKE CARE OF HER WOUND?

332
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:21,583
- SORT OF.
- THANK YOU.

333
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:24,000
I'M SASAMI.
- SASAMI, I SEE.

334
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:26,125
MY NAME IS TENCHI.

335
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:27,625
HER WOUND IS NOTHING SERIOUS.

336
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:30,000
SO THERE'S REALLY NO NEED
FOR WORRY, SASAMI.

337
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:33,500
- YOU WERE LUCKY, RYO-OHKI.
- ( meows )

338
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:36,458
- GOT TO GO.
BYE-BYE, SASAMI.

339
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,125
- ( gasps )

340
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,041
( sighs )

341
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:54,666
- SORRY, SASAMI.
IT'S MY FAULT.

342
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,166
I GOT KIND OF LOST.

343
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,666
- HEY, BE CAREFUL, RYO-OHKI.

344
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,458
WE'RE NOT IN
THE MAGIC KINGDOM NOW.

345
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,000
YOU SHOULDN'T BE HEARD TALKING

346
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:02,833
OR THERE MIGHT BE TROUBLE.

347
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:04,333
- I KNOW, I KNOW.

348
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:06,833
NOW, LET'S GO HOME
TO THE MAGIC KINGDOM.

349
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:10,208
- WELL, I'D LIKE TO STAY HERE
FOR A WHILE.

350
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:11,916
- WHAT? WHY'S THAT?

351
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,750
- WHY? I WONDER.

352
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:20,291
- ( bell rings )

353
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:25,458
- ( chattering )

354
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:29,250
- BYE-BYE.

355
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:30,583
- SEE YA'.
- WHERE'S MY BOOK?

356
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:31,833
- WE HAVE A TEST TOMORROW.

357
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:33,541
- I LEFT IT AT THE MALT SHOP.

358
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:36,333
- GEE, I WONDER WHERE
TENCHI IS RYO-OHKI.

359
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:38,791
- HEY, SASAMI,
WE'D BETTER LEAVE SOON.

360
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,916
- NOW WHERE...
( gasps )

361
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,916
HUH?

362
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,625
- HEY, ARE YOU
LISTENING, SASAMI?

363
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:45,541
- HA! THERE!

364
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:50,375
- TENCHI.

365
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:52,416
- OH, HI, AYEKA. HOW'S IT GOING?

366
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,875
- WOULD YOU LIKE
TO WALK HOME WITH ME?

367
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:56,250
- SURE I WOULD.

368
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:58,583
- WAIT A MINUTE.
- HUH?

369
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:01,541
- TENCHI HAS PROMISED TO
WALK HOME WITH ME TODAY.

370
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:02,833
- HUH?

371
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:04,041
- HMM?
- UH. 

372
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,875
- WE PROMISED TO WATCH
THE NIGHT LIGHTS

373
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,416
OF THE GRAND BRIDGE OF SETTO

374
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,500
AND SPEND THE NIGHT TOGETHER
TILL MORNING.

375
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:10,916
REMEMBER, TENCHI?

376
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,041
- WELL, NO.
I REALLY DON'T REMEMBER THAT.

377
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:15,750
- YOU REALLY ARE
A JUVENILE DELINQUENT, YOU KNOW!

378
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:18,750
GO AWAY, YOU PESKY PERSON.

379
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:20,166
SHOO, SHOO.

380
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,083
- HEY, WHY DON'T YOU GO AWAY.

381
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,750
LEAVE US ALONE, OKAY.
TENCHI IS MINE.

382
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:26,500
- I WILL NOT ALLOW IT.

383
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:29,583
- OH! STOP IT, GIRLS!

384
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:31,250
- ( growling )

385
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:33,500
- THERE THEY GO AGAIN.

386
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:34,916
- CUT IT OUT, BOTH OF YOU.

387
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,500
STOP IT RIGHT NOW, PLEASE.

388
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:37,708
IT'S REALLY DISGRACEFUL.

389
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,333
- WELL, I BELIEVE IN

390
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:41,208
OBLITERATING THE SOURCE
OF THE DISGRACE

391
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:42,791
HERE AND NOW, MISS KIYONE.

392
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:45,458
- SHE DOESN'T REALIZE SHE'S
A DISGRACE TOO, YOU KNOW.

393
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:48,791
- MISS RYOKO, I CAN'T
SURRENDER TENCHI TO YOU

394
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,916
BECAUSE YOU ARE
THE DISGRACE OF OUR SCHOOL.

395
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,791
IT IS MY DUTY AS THE CHAIRMAN
OF THE STUDENT BODY

396
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,791
TO SAVE TENCHI FROM YOUR
JUVENILE DELIQUENCY.

397
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:56,875
- OH BOY.

398
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:58,750
- ( grunts )
IT'S MY DUTY

399
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,291
TO SAVE MY TENCHI FROM YOU.

400
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:01,333
- ALL RIGHT, STOP.

401
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:03,083
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?

402
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,458
- NOW, CALM DOWN, AYEKA
WITH A DARK PATH.

403
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:06,750
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

404
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:08,708
- ( groans )

405
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:11,458
- OH NO, TENCHI'S
IN REAL TROUBLE.

406
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:15,416
HE SEEMS TO BE INVOLVED
IN A FIGHT BETWEEN THE GIRLS.

407
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,791
WHAT SHOULD WE DO, RYO-OHKI?

408
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:21,500
- SASAMI, TRANSFORM INTO
PRETTY SAMMY NOW.

409
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:23,375
- OKAY, THEN.

410
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,750
( vocalizing )

411
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:31,958
SAMMY DAVIS BROILER CHICKEN!

412
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:42,250
THE MAGICAL GIRL,

413

PRETTY SAMMY.

414
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,333
- I DON'T KNOW, THEY WERE
JUST STANDING OVER THERE.

415
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:48,416
ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY--
- ( chattering )

416
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,458
- OH MY, WE HAVE
A GREAT BIG AUDIENCE,

417
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:53,333
DON'T WE?
- ALL THE MORE DISGRACEFUL.

418
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,916
- LEAVE IT ALL TO ME, NOW.
- Both: HUH?

419
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,666
- FIGHTING IS NO GOOD AT ALL.

420
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,666
BE FRIENDS AND CHEERFUL,
ALL OF YOU.

421
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,541
THAT'S THE FIRST STEP
TO PEACE.

422
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:05,541
I ALWAYS SMILE
I'M PRETTY SAMMY.

423
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:07,083
- WHO ARE YOU?

424
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:08,583
- AND WHY ARE YOU 
DRESSED LIKE THAT?

425
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:09,791
ARE YOU CRAZY OR SOMETHING?

426
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:12,166
- NOT AS CRAZY AS YOU ARE,
GIRLY-GIRL.

427
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,583
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?

428
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:17,541
- WAIT A SECOND AND I'LL MAKE
YOU FRIENDS IN NO TIME.

429
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:19,458

BE FRIENDS, YOU TWO!

433
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,500
- ( both growl )
- ( screaming )

434
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:40,000
- MISS RYOKO? MISS AYEKA?

435
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:41,250
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

436
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:45,666
- UH, WHAT IS THIS
FEELING I HAVE?

437
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,166
MY HEART IS POUNDING.

438
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:51,083
- AYEKA, I'M SO SORRY,

439
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:53,083
SO SORRY
I WAS MEAN TO YOU.

440
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:56,416
- HMM, OH NO.
I'M SORRY.

441
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,500
- AYEKA, I CONFESS

442
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:02,833
THAT I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
RATHER FOND OF YOU.

443
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:06,791
- ( gasps )
IS THAT TRUE, RYOKO?

444
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:10,250
- BUT YOU SEEMED TO CARE ABOUT
NO ONE BUT TENCHI.

445
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,083
I GOT SO JEALOUS

446
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:14,541
THAT I HAD TO THROW MYSELF
BETWEEN YOU TWO.

447
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,166
I CAN'T LIVE WITH MYSELF.

448
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,000
CAN YOU EVER FORGIVE ME?

449
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:21,666
- MISS RYOKO.
- AYEKA.

450
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:25,041
- ( all gasping )

451

00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:30,833
PLEASE DON'T LET ME GO,
NEVER EVER.

453
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:33,666
- HMM, YOU'RE A SWEETHEART.

454
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,916
- UH, HOLD ONTO YOUR SANITY,
BOTH OF YOU.

455
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,625

456
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:42,083
- WHAT IS GOING ON HERE? HUH?

457
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:46,583
- Ryoko: SO THIS IS WHAT
THEY CALL HAPINESS?

458
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:48,208
- HOLD ME TIGHT.

459
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:50,041
- UM, I'M NOT SURE
THIS IS EVOLVING

460
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,166
INTO AN APPROPRIATE 
RELATIONSHIP, GIRLS.

461
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,625
- OH, THIS HAS TO BE THE MOST
DISGRACEFUL MOMENT

462
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:56,000
IN THE HISTORY OF THIS SCHOOL.

463
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:57,958
- I'M SO HAPPY FOR THEM

464
00:20:58,041 --> 00:20:59,708
BEING SUCH GOOD FRIENDS AND ALL.

465
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,708
- I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

466
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:04,166
- I REALLY LOVE YOU, AYEKA.

467
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,166

468
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,083

470
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:19,083
- HOW FAR DO THESE
DIFFERENT WORLDS GO?

471
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:22,041
WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO
OUR HERO AND HEROINES?
