- SONIA...

27
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,916
- MY NAME IS YOSHO,

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,916
THE MAN WHO ONCE DESERTED
JURAI'S ROYAL FAMILY.

29
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:23,041
- I AM AZAKA,
A KNIGHT OF JURAI.

30
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:24,916
- AND I AM KAMIDAKE.

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,458
- AND FROM NOW ON, WE PLEDGE
OUR ALLEGIANCE TO YOU.

32
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:34,791
- YO!

33
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:57,500
- THIS PLANET IS THE PLACE

34
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:59,916
WHERE THE JURAI IMPERIAL
VILLA USED TO BE.

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,750
- HMM.

36
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:03,916
AND IT'S A PERFECT SPOT
TO HIDE FOR A WHILE

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,666
FROM THOSE WHO ARE
AFTER US, AYEKA.

38
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,791
- ( screaming )

39
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:10,583
- THESE ARE THE RUINS
OF DREAMS PAST.

40
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:21,000
- SOMEHOW,
THAT FACE LOOKS FAMILIAR.

41
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,625
- HE HAS GENTLE EYES.

42
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:31,666
AHA!  HIS EYES LOOK
JUST LIKE YOURS, TENCHI.

43
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,833
- HUH?  YOU THINK SO?

44
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:37,041
- THAT'S THE LEGENDARY
WARRIOR YOSHO.

45
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:39,208
- HUH?
- THAT'S THE STATUE OF YOSHO.

46
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:42,291
- WHAT?!  SO THAT'S YOU
WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG, FATHER?

47
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:45,833
- YOU SURE WERE
HANDSOME.  WOW!

48
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:47,166
- HUH?

49
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,208
SO THAT'S GRANDPA.

50
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:53,583
- LOOK, IT LOOKS LIKE THERE USED
TO BE ANOTHER STATUE OVER THERE.

51
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:57,833
- Sasami: YEAH, EVERYBODY LOOK.

52
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:00,041
I WONDER WHO IT WAS.

53
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,708
- HUH?  I DON'T REALLY
KNOW, SASAMI.

54
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:04,708
- THAT USED TO BE
A STATUE OF A MAN

55
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:07,875
WITH THE MOST AMAZING
POTENTIAL.

56
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:17,000
HE WAS OF NOBLE BIRTH.

57
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:20,375
HIS FAMILY TREE BEING THAT
OF JURAI'S ROYAL FAMILY.

58
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:23,125
HE WAS
EXTRAORDINARILY GIFTED

59
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:26,000
BOTH IN SWORDSMANSHIP
AND ACADEMICS.

60
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:50,083
HE WAS A WONDERFUL MAN.

61
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:51,750
AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HE

62
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:54,791
WHO WAS PRAISED
AS THE LEGENDARY WARRIOR.

63
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:02,000
IF ONLY HE HAD
NOT ALLOWED HIMSELF

64
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:05,166
TO BE CHANGED SO MUCH
BY THE JURAI POWER,

65
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,583
THE INCREDIBLE POWER
THAT BELONGS

66
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:11,583
TO JURAI'S ROYAL FAMILY,
THE DOMINATOR OF ALL GALAXIES.

67
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:15,375
THE SECRET BEHIND THE FAMILY'S
ABSOLUTE STRENGTH LIES

68
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:19,166
IN THIS JURAI POWER.

69
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,916
THE MYSTERIOUS POWER
GIVEN BY THE GOD,

70
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,166
THE MIGHTIEST POWER
IN THE UNIVERSE

71
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,125
THAT DENIES ANY ELUCIDATION

72
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:28,583
BY HUMAN INTELLIGENCE.

73
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:31,166
THAT IS THE JURAI POWER.

74
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,541
THE MAN BECAME FASCINATED
AND OBSESSED WITH THE POWER.

75
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,083
HE BECAME
A PRISONER OF IT.

76
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:46,833
THE POWER BEING FAR TOO IMMENSE
FOR HIM TO RESIST.

77
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:50,125
AND THERE WAS NOTHING

78
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:53,125
THAT COULD STOP HIS AMBITION.

79
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:54,333
- ( shouting )

80
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,666
AND THEN I BATTLED
WITH HIM

81
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,625
AND WON.

82
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:30,500
AFTER THAT, HE VANISHED
INTO THE DARKNESS OF SPACE.

83
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:34,375
HIS NAME ERASED
FROM JURAI'S HISTORY.

84
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:39,625
IT WAS THEN I DECIDED
TO LEAVE JURAI

85
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,500
NEVER TO RETURN.

86
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:44,208
- SO THAT'S THE IDENTITY
OF OUR ENEMY.

87
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:50,625
- EVEN THOUGH
THERE IS NO PROOF.

88
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,333
KAGATO.

89
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,416
- OF COURSE I HAD NO IDEA.

90
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,541
I NEVER KNEW ANYTHING
HAPPENED LIKE THAT ON JURAI.

91
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:11,583
- WELL, I DON'T THINK AYEKA
KNEW EITHER, SASAMI.

92
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,041
SHE'S KIND OF SHAKEN.

93
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,875
- HERE'S YOUR DINNER,
EVERYONE.

94
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:17,083
THANKS FOR WAITING!

95
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:19,250
- WHAT?!  MORE CARROTS?!

96
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,833
- AFRAID SO.

97
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:23,041
IT'S THE ONLY FOOD LEFT.
- ( sighs )

98
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:25,166
- I BOUGHT TOO MANY CARROTS.

99
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,041
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
LIFE IS LIKE THAT.

100
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:29,041
- I KNOW RYO-OHKI LOVES THEM,

101
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:32,083
BUT I'M GONNA
TURN ORANGE SOON.

102
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:35,375
- OH!  THAT REMINDS ME.
WHERE IS RYO-OHKI?

103
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:37,583
- HMM?
- YEAH.  WHERE IS SHE?

104
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:39,958
WOULDN'T WANT HER
TO MISS MORE YUMMY CARROTS.

105
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:42,916
- I GOTTA SAY I KIND OF LIKE
HAVING DINNER UNDER THE STARS

106
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,791
LIKE THIS, DON'T YOU GUYS?

107
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,833
- YEAH, I AGREE.

108
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:50,833
- HEY, DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD
GO GET TENCHI AND AYEKA?

109
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:54,291
- MIHOSHI, I THINK WE SHOULD
JUST LEAVE THEM ALONE FOR NOW.

110
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:56,666
- YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.

111
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,291
- HEY, COME ON, PAY ATTENTION!
THE FIRE'S GOING OUT!

112
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:00,708
- OH, NO!

113
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,250
I REALLY WISH
THEY'D COOK FASTER.

114
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:08,625
HUH?

115
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:14,916
- ( screaming )

116
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,500
- TENCHI.

117
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,541
- OH.  HELLO, AYEKA.

118
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:40,000
- YOU SEEM VERY LOST
IN THOUGHT.

119
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:42,500
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT?

120
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:50,958
YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT
YOUR ROYAL BLOOD, AREN'T YOU?

121
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:53,583
- I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S JUST SO STRANGE.

122
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:56,833
ONLY A WHILE AGO I WAS JUST
AN ORDINARY EARTHLING, YOU KNOW?

123
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:59,083
JUST AN ORDINARY
HIGH SCHOOL BOY

124
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:00,416
AND NOTHING MORE.

125
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,750
THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN,
I DON'T KNOW.

126
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,833
- TENCHI,
I KNOW IT'S DIFFICULT,

127
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:08,833
BUT I'VE ENJOYED IT ALL.
- HUH?

128
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,583
- FROM THE TIME
WE LEFT THE EARTH

129
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,083
CHASED BY
THE JURAI FORCES.

130
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:14,625
IN FACT, EVER SINCE
I ARRIVED ON THE EARTH

131
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:16,583
AND STARTED TO LIVE
WITH YOU AND YOUR FAMILY,

132
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:18,458
I HAVE BEEN SO VERY HAPPY,

133
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:21,708
ENJOYING EVERY MINUTE OF LIFE.
- BUT--

134
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:23,625
- BUT I HAVE ALWAYS
UNDERSTOOD MY DUTY

135
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:26,416
AS THE FIRST PRINCESS
OF THE PLANET JURAI. 

136
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,500
AND OF COURSE I KNEW 
THAT MY HAPPY HOLIDAY

137
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,666
WOULD HAVE TO COME
TO AN END ONE DAY.

138
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:34,541
AND, YES, I ALWAYS KNEW
I WOULD EVENTUALLY

139
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:36,708
HAVE TO SAY GOOD-BYE
TO YOU, TENCHI.

140
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:38,625
- AYEKA, I ALWAYS THOUGHT--

141
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,333
- PLEASE LISTEN, TENCHI.

142
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:42,291
EVEN THOUGH
I AM THE FIRST PRINCESS,

143
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:46,083
I AM MERELY A MEMBER OF ONE
OF MANY BRANCH FAMILIES.

144
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,875
NOW THAT
IT HAS BEEN REVEALED

145
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:49,208
YOU ARE
THE DIRECT DESCENDANT

146
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:51,875
OF JURAI'S ROYAL FAMILY,
IT IS YOU, TENCHI,

147
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:53,208
WHO SHOULD
SUCCEED THE THRONE.

148
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,750
- BUT, AYEKA, I--

149
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:02,541
- IF YOU DO SO, TENCHI,
I CAN BE NEAR YOU.

150
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:05,000
TENCHI, I CAN BE
CLOSE TO YOU ALWAYS.

151
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:07,875
AND THE WISH
I'VE ALWAYS HAD,

152
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,500
THE WISH I'D THOUGHT
WAS IMPOSSIBLE

153
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:12,250
MIGHT COME TRUE.

154
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:15,000
I CAN'T HELP
THINKING THAT, TENCHI.

155
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,833
FORGIVE ME FOR POURING
OUT MY HEART.

156
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:23,791
( sighs )

157
00:11:56,166 --> 00:12:00,083
- I KNEW YOU WOULD COME,
YOSHO.

158
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:02,291
YES, I WAS CERTAIN

159
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,541
YOU WOULD COME
HERE, YOSHO.

160
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:08,000
- AND SO IT WAS YOU
ALL ALONG, KAGATO.

161
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:38,250
- I'VE WAITED.
I'VE WAITED SO LONG

162
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,166
FOR THIS MOMENT
TO MEET YOU AGAIN.

163
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,875
OF COURSE I WASN'T DEAD,

164
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:44,708
BUT YOU KNEW THAT.

165
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:46,541
ALL THIS TIME,

166
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:49,583
I WAS IN THE DARKNESS
OF THE UNIVERSE,

167
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:52,583
REFINING AND STRENGTHENING
MY JURAI POWER

168
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,416
TO THE MOST EXTREME LIMIT.

169
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:58,333
I'VE BEEN THINKING OF YOU
FOR A LONG, LONG TIME.

170
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:07,375
I MUST SAY, IT'S VERY NICE
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

171
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:13,833
I SEE YOU'VE AGED,
EH, YOSHO?

172
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:17,333
- I THINK I LOOK PRETTY GOOD
FOR MY AGE.

173
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:19,625
- JUST LOOK AT ME.
THE INFINITE POWER OF YOUTH

174
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:22,125
IS COMPLETELY MINE
TO COMMAND.

175
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:23,416
- IS THAT ONE OF THE POWERS
YOU ACQUIRED

176
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,541
IN THE DARKNESS
OF THE UNIVERSE?

177
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:27,041
- INDEED, IT IS.

178
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:29,916
THERE IS NOTHING
JURAI'S POWER CANNOT DO.

179
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:33,541
- SO YOU'VE HAD
A UNIVERSAL FACELIFT.

180
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,500
IS THAT IT, KAGATO?

181
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:42,083
- ARE YOU READY?

182
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,125
THAT'S GOOD.

183
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:59,833
I CAN FEEL YOUR
FIGHTING SPIRIT NOW.

184
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:03,708
- KAGATO, I HAVE TO MAKE
YOU DIE ONCE AGAIN, YOU KNOW?

185
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:06,166
- AS THE HEIR TO THE THRONE
OF PLANET JURAI,

186
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:09,416
WILL YOUR POWER WIN,
OR WILL MY POWER TRIUMPH

187
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,250
AMPLIFIED BY THE DARKNESS
OF THE UNIVERSE?

188
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,791
WE SHALL SEE.

189
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:21,291
TAKE THIS!  HA!

190
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,666
YOU'RE STILL QUITE GOOD.

191
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:34,416
YOU'RE EXACTLY
LIKE THE OLD DAYS.

192
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,416
BUT I'M NOT EXACTLY
LIKE THE OLD DAYS.

193
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:44,416
WELL, WELL.
THAT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE, YOSHO.

194
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,833
WORTHY OF
A LEGENDARY WARRIOR.

195
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:55,458
- HUH?
- I DID WARN YOU

196
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:58,458
I AM NOT THE SAME
AS THE OLD DAYS.

197
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:00,625
- I CAN SEE THAT.

198
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:02,125
- IN THE DARKNESS
OF THE UNIVERSE

199
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:04,166
FIGHTING A FEAR
AND DESPERATION

200
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,708
WORSE THAN DEATH ITSELF,

201
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:09,958
I WOULD DREAM
OF THIS MOMENT OVER AND OVER,

202
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:13,416
DREAM OF THE MOMENT
I KILLED YOU, YOSHO.

203
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:18,083
( screaming )

204
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,250
- KAGATO.

205
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,416
KAGATO.

206
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:52,791
AT THE TIME I SLAYED YOU,
I KILLED MYSELF AS WELL. 

207
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:54,833
AND NOW AGAIN.

208
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:58,416
WHY MUST I FACE YOU
IN BATTLE ONCE AGAIN?

209
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:13,583
FORGIVE ME, KAGATO.

210
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:18,083
- HUH?

211
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,833
INTERESTING.

212
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:28,666
YOU WANT US TO KILL EACH OTHER
AT THE SAME TIME, DON'T YOU?

213
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:32,083
- ( shouting )

214
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,125
- ( explosion )
- ( gasps )

215
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,625
- WHAT WAS THAT?!

216
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:44,416
- IT'S A TREMENDOUS ENERGY,
VERY CLOSE.

217
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,041
- THE JURAI POWER?

218
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:48,083
- PROBABLY.  YES.

219
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:51,166
- ( gags )

220
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,958
- ( gasps )

221
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,666
- GRANDPA.

222
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,291
- HURRY, KAMIDAKE.
- RIGHT!

223
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,750
- WELL, THAT'S TOO BAD.

224
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:11,708
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE
THE ONLY ONE TO DIE TODAY.

225
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:16,916
WHY DON'T YOU GO
AND VISIT HELL THIS TIME?

226
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,041
YOU CAN GO
AND TAKE MY PLACE!  HUH?

227
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:26,291
- YOU THERE, WHO ARE YOU?

228
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:29,250
- JURAI'S EMPEROR AND KING.
 YOU'RE NOT.

229
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:33,125
- YES, THE MIGHTIEST AND LAST
OF ALL THE JURAI KINGS.

230
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:35,291
I AM THE GOD.

231
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:37,666
- WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT!

232
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:45,250
- YOU'RE FUN TO PLAY WITH,
BUT I'M VERY BUSY JUST NOW.

233
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:47,666
GET LOST!

234
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:58,875
- ( screams )

235
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:03,333
- RYOKO!

236
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:08,375
RYOKO.  HUH?  GRANDPA!

237
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:11,958
- YOU WATCH OUT, TENCHI.

238
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:14,500
THIS GUY'S
NO ONE TO MESS WITH.

239
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:17,250
- PRINCESS AYEKA.

240
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:19,791
- HUH? ( gasps )

241
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:22,000
- I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.
YOU'RE JUST IN TIME

242
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:25,291
TO WITNESS THE LEGENDARY
WARRIOR'S DESTRUCTION.

243
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:27,750
- NOT SO FAST.
- HMM?

244
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:29,708
- YOU WILL HAVE TO

245
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:32,916
DESTROY US FIRST, KAGATO.

246
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,458
- BE GONE, YOU FOOLS!

247
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,625
- AZAKA!  KAMIDAKE!

248
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:51,250
- YOU WILL HAVE
TO FIGHT ME NOW!

249
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:54,166
- SILLY BOY.

250
00:18:57,625 --> 00:19:00,958
I SEE.

251
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:03,416
- YOU MUST STAY BACK,
TENCHI.

252
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:11,541
- WE'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE.

253
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:13,750
- WELL, MY BOY,
WHY DON'T YOU AND I

254
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:17,208
CHOOSE ANOTHER TIME
AND PLACE TO MEET?

255
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:20,166
- NO!

256
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,833
( screaming )

257
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:38,375
- HUH?  OH!

258
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:40,083
- NO.  AYEKA!

259
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:43,541
- TENCHI!

260
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:46,041
- AYEKA!

261
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:48,958
- TENCHI, HELP ME!

262
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:51,750
- OH, NO!

263
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,666
- ( screeches )

264
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,625
- COME BACK, AYEKA!

265
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:59,958
- I WILL BE WAITING FOR YOU
AT THE JURAI PALACE,

266
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:03,583
AND I WISH YOU LUCK
GETTING THERE IN ONE PIECE.

267
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:07,208
- YOU WON'T GET AWAY!

268
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:09,375
- ( laughing )

269
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:29,666
- TREACHEROUS COWARD!

270
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,291
- PLEASE, GRANDPA.

271
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:36,583
GRANDPA, HANG ON.

272
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:42,875
- PLEASE, GRANDPA,
YOU MUST LIVE.

273
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:44,541
- QUICKLY.
WE HAVE TO HELP HIM!

274
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:46,208
- GOTCHA.

275
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:53,125
- HERE, TENCHI, TAKE THIS.

276
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:55,250
- WHAT IS IT, GRANDPA?

277
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:57,125
- SWORD TENCHI.

278
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:59,958
THE MAGICAL SWORD THAT
TRANSFORMS JURAI'S POWER

279
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:03,708
INTO A BLADE.
- SWORD TENCHI?

280
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:06,333
- TENCHI, YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE

281
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:08,416
WHO CAN DESTROY KAGATO.

282
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,916
