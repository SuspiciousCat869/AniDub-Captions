00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:05,666
- Ayeka: THERE IS A LEGEND
OF AN IMPERIAL SON

30
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,000
THAT HAS BEEN TOLD
ON THE PLANET JURAI.

31
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:13,833
HE WAS THE BEST SWORDSMAN
EVER SEEN

32
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:16,166
AND GIFTED WITH AN
UNMATCHED MASTERY 

33
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,083
OF JURIA'S POWER.

34
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:34,875
HE WAS COMPASSIONATE
AND AFFECTIONATE.

35
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:36,583
EVERYBODY ADORED HIM.

36
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:44,041
BUT HE SIMPLY VANISHED
WITHOUT A TRACE

37
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:45,791
BEFORE ASCENDING
TO THE THRONE.

38
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:49,000
HIS WHEREABOUTS
WERE TOTALLY UNKNOWN.

39
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:51,666
HIS NAME WAS YOSHO.

40
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,541
THAT IS THE LEGEND 
OF THE CROWN-PRINCE

41
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:56,875
THAT HAS BEEN HANDED DOWN
FOR GENERATIONS

42
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:59,750
ON THE PLANET JURAI.

43
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:01,791
- YO!

44
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:07,916
- AH.

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,916
YOU KNOW, I THINK THERE'S
NOTHING QUITE LIKE

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,875
SOME QUALITY TIME
WITH FAMILY.

47
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,875
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT IS THE BEST.

48
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:15,083
- IF WE'RE ALL FAMILY,

49
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:17,250
TENCHI AND I
ARE HUSBAND AND WIFE, HUH?

50
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:18,833

WE HAVE MORE IMPORTANT THINGS
TO THINK ABOUT, DON'T WE?

54
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:28,250
- CALM DOWN, TENCHI.
- BUT GRANDPA--

55
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,875
- LOOK THERE.
TENCHI, THAT SUPERNOVA

56
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:32,666
IS JUST GORGEOUS,
ISN'T IT?

57
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,083
- OH, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

58
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:35,416
- HOW CAN YOU BE SO COMPOSED

59
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,875
WHEN THERE'S NOTHING
BUT ENDLESS SPACE

60
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:38,791

- Washu:
THE HOUSE HAD BEEN COMPRESSED.

64
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,541
ALL I HAD TO DO
WAS RESTORE IT,

65
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,500
LIKE ADDING WATER
TO DEHYDRATED FOOD.

66
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:50,750
- Sasami: IT'S LUCKY THE HOUSE
WAS JUST THE PERFECT SIZE

67
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,541

68

WE HAVE ENOUGH BEDDING
FOR EVERYONE.

70
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:59,958
- HI THERE, KIYONE,
I BROUGHT YOU SOME TEA.

71
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,625
- THANK YOU, SASAMI.

72
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:07,208
- SOMEHOW, THAT VIEW JUST
DOESN'T HELP ME RELAX,

73
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:08,708
NOT AT ALL.

74
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,125
- HOW ARE YOU GUYS FEELING?
ANY BETTER?

75
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:17,291
- MY ENERGY CIRCUIT IS NOT YET
COMPLETELY RECHARGED.

76
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:19,791
- I TRANSFORMED YOU BACK
TO NORMAL SIZE.

77
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:22,541
WOULD IT HURT YOU SO MUCH
TO SHOW ME A LITTLE GRATITUDE?

78
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,208
- WE WOULD ALL HAVE
BEEN BETTER OFF

79
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,208
IF THEY HAD REMAINED
IN THEIR COMPACT SIZE.

80
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:27,833
I THINK THEY TAKE UP
TOO MUCH SPACE.

81
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,500
- I WOULD NOT LIKE THAT.

82
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:31,291

WAS ENOUGH.

161
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:40,375
- THE BOTTOM LINE

162
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:42,375
IS THAT WE HAVE TO
EARN SOME MONEY AS WE GO.

163

OTHERWISE, WE'LL NEVER MAKE IT

226
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:36,958
- UGH!

227
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:39,750
PEOPLE THOUGHT I WAS GONNA BE 
AN EXECUTIVE AT GALAXY POLICE,

228
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,708
BUT NOW...

229
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:44,000
LOOK AT
WHAT'S HAPPENED TO ME!

230
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:48,208

231
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,916

BEAUTIFUL GIRLS.

235
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:03,791
- AND THAT'S THE TRUTH.

236
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:05,833
IT'S A PARADISE.
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

237
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:07,166
- Both: HUH?

238
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:13,875
- ( laughs )

239
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:15,750
( gulping )

240
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:18,291
- OH THIS IS GREAT, HUH?
ARE WE HAVING FUN YET?

241
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:20,958
- Both: HI, HOW ARE YOU DOING?

242
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,541
- HUH?

244
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:34,000
- WHAT CAN I GET FOR YOU?

245
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,750
- I WILL HAVE
THE SPECIAL OF THE HOUSE.

246
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:38,958
- OH, OKAY.

247
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,041

- HERE WE GO.

249
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,000
- HMM, PRETTY GOOD.

250
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,166
- WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

251
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:10,291
- TELL ME SOMETHING.

252
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:11,875
HAVE YOU SEEN
THIS WOMAN BEFORE?

253
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:15,541
- LET'S SEE, OUR PLACE

254
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:16,708
SO I...

255
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:20,458
- SO YOU HAVEN'T?

256
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:22,291
WELL, THANK YOU FOR THE DRINK.

257
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:24,625
- AND THIS IS YOUR CHECK, MA'AM.

258
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:27,500
- HMM? 11,000?

259
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:30,083
IS THIS SOME KIND OF A JOKE?

260
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:32,041
- LIKE I SAID,
THIS IS THE BILL.

261
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:34,666
- I JUST HAD ONE DRINK.
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING!

262
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,791
- ( whimpers )

263
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,625

264
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,916
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
COME AGAIN.

265
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,041
- YES, PLEASE COME AGAIN.

266
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:44,916
SHE SEEMS TO BE VERY UPSET.

267
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,541
- YES, I WONDER WHAT HAPPENED?

268
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,166
- FORGET IT, JERK!

269
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,958
- Both: HUH?
- I'M NEVER COMING BACK!

270
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:51,458
DO YOU HEAR ME? NEVER!
- WHAT?

271
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:53,041
- OH MY.
- OH.

272
00:13:56,708 --> 00:14:00,708
- AND 20, AND 40,
AND 60, AND 80,

273
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:02,291
THAT MAKES 100.

274
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:05,333
AND 20, AND 40, AND 60, AND 80--
- ( sighs )

275
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:07,375
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

276
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:09,333
BEING THE CROWN PRINCESS
AS I AM,

277
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:12,250
WHY DO I HAVE TO BE INVOLVED
IN THIS RIP-OFF BAR?

278
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,375
- LAST I HEARD,
YOU WERE A FUGITIVE IN HIDING.

279
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:15,541
GOT ME, PRINCESS?

280
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:17,833
- PRINCESS AYEKA, I'M SO SORRY.

281
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,041
- UNDER DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES,

282
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,958
YOU WOULD BE ABLE
TO TRAVEL LIKE ROYALTY.

283
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:23,291
- UH, I REMEMBER MY FIRST TRIP.

284
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:27,458
YES, I REMEMBER MY FIRST TRIP
TO A NEIGHBORING GALAXY.

285
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,166
WE VISITED FAMOUS PLACES
IN THE UNIVERSE

286
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,583
FULL OF NATURAL BEAUTY
AND HISTORICAL INTEREST.

287
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:42,625
IT REALLY WAS
A FABULOUS TRIP.

288
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:50,833
OF COURSE, WE STAYED
AT A FANCY HOTEL

289
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:52,791
IN THE ROYAL SUITE.

290
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:02,041
HMM, HOW STRANGE.

291
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:09,416
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN
A SWEET MEMORY,

292
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,541
BUT THERE SEEMED TO
BE SOMETHING UNPLEASANT.

293
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:21,125
( gasps )
NOW, I KNOW.

294
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:24,375
- ( snoring )

295
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:27,750
- HEY THERE, YOU,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ON MY BED?!

296
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:33,750
- Present-day Ayeka:
NEVERTHELESS,

297
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:36,875
THE BLUE OCEAN WAS
STILL BEAUTIFUL.

298
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:42,750
( sighs )
IT'S SO CALM AND PEACEFUL.

299
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,000
- ( sirens wail )

300
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:49,708
- HUH?
- GET OUT OF MY WAY!

301
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:50,541
- ( screams )

302
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:54,666
( screaming )

303
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,083
- YOU LIAR.

304
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:58,041
YOU'RE JUST MAKING UP
THAT STORY.

305
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,041
- OH I SEE.
YOU'RE AWAKE ARE YOU?

306
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,000
- WHAT REALLY HAPPENED WAS

307
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:04,750
I WAS WORKING AT
A SEASIDE HOTEL.

308
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:07,166
- ( machine whirrs )

309
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,833
- I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING.

310
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:10,625
YOU SHOULD FEEL HONORED
TO BE ABLE TO CLEAN

311
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:13,750
THE ROOM OF A CROWN PRINCESS
OF JURAI'S ROYAL FAMILY.

312
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:16,583
YES, INDEED, IT'S QUITE
A PRIVILEGE. - ( panting )

313
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:18,250
- ( laughing )
- ( pants ) WORK!

00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:24,291
- Present-day Ryoko:
BUT WHEN I WAS OUT ON THE OCEAN,

315
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,875
I FELT SO HAPPY.

316
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:29,041
IT'S SO QUIET.

THE BIGGEST LIAR OF ALL TIME.

321
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,791
- WELL, IT TAKES ONE
TO KNOW ONE, GIRL.

322
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,708
- WHO DO YOU THINK IS
TELLING THE TRUTH?

323
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:46,083
- BOTH STORIES SOUND SO REAL.

324
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:48,541
- WELL, BOTH OF THEM
MUST BE TELLING THE TRUTH.

- WELL, I THINK
I'M GOING TO BED.

328
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:55,583
- Sasami: ME TOO.

329
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:58,083
( yawns )
- WE SHOULD GET SOME SLEEP TOO.

330
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:00,166

TO GET UP EARLY TOMORROW.

331
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,166
- Washu:
AND WE'RE OFF TO BED TOO.

332
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,750
- Both: ( grumbles )

333
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:08,750
- OH, YEAH, DID ANYONE REMEMBER
TO TURN OFF THE GAS?

334
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,666
- YES, I DID.
I REMEMBERED TO DO IT.

335
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,041
SO NO ONE HAS TO WORRY, WASHU.
- OH GOOD.  THANK YOU.

THERE HAS JUST BEEN
A MYSTERIOUS EXPLOSION

342
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,000
IN ZONE 9-0-7.

343
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:34,291
PROCEED TO THE SCENE
IMMEDIATELY.

344
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:35,583
- REPEAT.

345
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:48,791
WE HAVE JUST DISCOVERED
THAT THE EXPLOSION IN ZONE 9-0-7

346
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:51,250
WAS CAUSED BY PRINCESS AYEKA
AND HER GROUP.

347

ALL PATROL SHIPS,
ENGAGE IN PURSUIT.

- A WHOLE BUNCH OF THEM
ARE COMING AFTER US.

350
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:02,458
- AND IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT,
MIHOSHI.

351
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:03,750
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M SORRY.

352
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,375
- HURRY, THEY'RE
RIGHT BEHIND US.

353
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,291
- OH NO.
A BATTLESHIP OF JURAI.

354
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:17,458
- A BATTLESHIP IN FRONT AND
THE GALAXY POLICE IN BACK, HUH?

355
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:18,750
- WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

- IT'S KEN-OHKI.

358

SO WE'VE GOT NAGI
ON OUR TAIL NOW TOO!

YOU'RE GOING?!

OKAY?

- WHAT?!

373
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:20,958
HEY, HOLD ON A MINUTE!

374
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:30,875
YOU WILL PAY FOR THIS, RYOKO.

375

YOU WILL PAY!

376
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,875
- Newscaster: PRINCESS AYEKA
IS THOUGHT TO BE RESPONSIBLE

377
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:40,333
FOR BOMBING ON
PLANET CONCORD.

378
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:43,041
THE TERRORIST GROUP EXCHANGED
FIRE WITH THE GALAXY POLICE--

379
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:45,916
- GREAT, I GET IT. SO NOW WE'RE
TERRORISTS. THAT'S PERFECT.

380
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,208
- THE POLICE ARE STILL LOOKING
FOR THE SUSPECTS.

381
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:51,166
EMPEROR YOSHO DELIVERED A SPEECH
REGARDING THIS INCIDENT,

382
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,875
CONDEMNING IT AS A REBELLION
AGAINST THE SPACE PEACE.

383
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:56,583
- I DON'T KNOW ABOUT 
THIS YOSHO CHARACTER.

384
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:59,083
CAN HE REALLY BE THAT
LEGENDARY HERO, OR WHAT?

385
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:00,583
- I DON'T KNOW.

386
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,416
I THINK IT'S STRANGE
THAT HE HASN'T APPEARED

387
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,125
IN FRONT OF THE MEDIA YET.

388
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:07,416
LOOK, WE HAVE TO REVEAL
HIS TRUE IDENTITY

389

OR OTHERWISE, WE'LL BE WANTED
CRIMINALS FOREVER, TENCHI.
