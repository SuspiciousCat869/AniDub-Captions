- HERE, TENCHI, TAKE THIS.

28
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:11,333
- WHAT IS IT, GRANDPA?

29
00:02:11,416 --> 00:02:15,083
- SWORD TENCHI.
THE MAGICAL SWORD

30
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:18,500
THAT TRANSFORMS JURAI'S POWER
INTO A BLADE.

31
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:20,375
- SWORD TENCHI?

32
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:22,208
- TENCHI, YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE

33
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:25,208
WHO CAN DESTROY KAGATO.

34
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:27,541
- ( gasps )
- GO, TENCHI.

35
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:30,083
IT IS ALL UP TO YOU NOW.

36
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,541
- RYOKO, YOU'LL BE FINE.

37
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:41,291
- ( man yells )

00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:15,041
- IS HE GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT?
IS HE GONNA MAKE IT?

39
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:17,875
- I DON'T KNOW YET.
- COME ON, GRANDPA.

40
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:20,875
- GET A HOLD OF YOURSELF.

41
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:24,208
WE HAVE TO VISIT
JURAI'S ROYAL PALACE NOW.

42
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:26,291
- BUT, WASHU, I CAN'T--
- LISTEN TO ME!

43
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:27,750
THERE'S NO NEED
TO BE DISCOURAGED.

44
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,041
I'M DYING
TO SEE KAGATO DEAD.

45
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:32,250
AND FOR THAT,
I'M COUNTING ON YOU, TENCHI.

46
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:34,375
- NO, I CAN'T.

47
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:36,916
NOT EVEN GRANDPA
WAS A MATCH FOR HIM.

48
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,458
AND, BESIDES, I DON'T POSSESS
THIS JURAI POWER

49
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:42,291
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT.
- I SAY YOU CAN, TENCHI.

50
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:45,916
YOU DOUBT MY JUDGMENT?
- YOUR JUDGMENT?

51
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,125
- I COULD FEEL IT EVER SINCE
I FIRST SAW YOU.

52
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:51,416
I KNEW YOU HAD
GREAT POTENTIAL WITHIN YOU.

53
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,958
SINCE YOU WERE UNAWARE
OF YOUR CAPABILITY,

54
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:59,083
I WASN'T 100% SURE.

55
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:01,333
BUT NOW I CAN
SEE IT CLEARLY.

56
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:05,416
TENCHI,
YOU DO HAVE A FORCE

57
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,791
SURPASSING THAT
OF YOUR GRANDFATHER.

58
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:20,500
THE JURAI POWER.

59
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,500
( screams )

60
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:36,666
( gasps )

61
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:42,125
IT'S A WHOLE NEW GAME NOW.

62
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:47,250
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO,
TENCHI?

63
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:53,208
- ALL OF JURAI'S MILITARY
IS ATTACKING US.

64
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:58,041
- ALL SHIPS READY TO ATTACK.

65
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:01,000
YOUR TARGET IS THE OLD
ROYAL PALACE OF JURAI.

66
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:04,583
FIRE!

67
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:30,875
- HANG ON.  I'M TAKING US
TO THE BACK OF THE PALACE.

68
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,791
- ( all gasp )

69
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:46,125
- ( screaming )

70
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:00,500
- IT'S KEN-OHKI!
- YEAH!

71
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:15,916
- ( meowing )

72
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:21,625
- THANKS VERY MUCH, NAGI.
YOU JUST SAVED US.

73
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:23,375
- DON'T GET THE WRONG IDEA.

74
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:25,125
THE ONLY REASON
YOU'RE HERE IS BECAUSE

75
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:28,291
I DON'T WANT ANYBODY ELSE
TO TAKE RYOKO'S LIFE.

76
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,250
- OH, I SEE.

77
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:33,125
- HUH?

78
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:35,458
HMM.  YOU'VE GOT
A NICE PLACE HERE.

79
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:37,291
- WE DON'T HAVE MUCH
TO OFFER YOU,

80
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:40,416
BUT PLEASE MAKE YOURSELF 
AT HOME, WON'T YOU, NAGI?

81
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,375
- COULD YOU EXCUSE US?  WE'RE
IN THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING.

82
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,875
WELL, REALLY,
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

83
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:49,791
WE JUST HAVE TO SNEAK
INTO JURAI'S ROYAL PALACE

84
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:52,375
AND DO A LITTLE RESCUING
OF THE PRINCESS, THAT'S ALL.

85
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:55,916
- YEAH.  I SEE YOU'VE GOT
YOUR HANDS FULL, DON'T YOU?

86
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,833
- HERE.

87
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:00,250
WOULD YOU LIKE SOME TEA?

88
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,458
- MMM.  GOOD.

89
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:14,000
LITTLE GIRL,
THIS TEA IS EXCELLENT.

90
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:17,375
NOW YOU ARE A PROFESSIONAL.
AM I RIGHT ABOUT THAT?

91
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:20,833
- ( laughs )

92
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:23,083
- ( machines beeping )

93
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:34,500
- LISTEN, TENCHI,
WHATEVER HAPPENS FROM NOW ON,

94
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:36,583
YOU STAND FIRM
AND FACE YOUR DESTINY

95
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:39,166
WITHOUT FEAR,
BUT WITH COURAGE.

96
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:49,791
- I WON'T LET YOU DOWN,
GRANDPA.

97
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:55,708
- ARE YOU GOING NOW, TENCHI?

98
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:56,833
- YEAH.

99
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:59,416
- YOU COULD DIE.
YOU KNOW THAT?

100
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,250
- POSSIBLY.

101
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:06,375
- TENCHI,
YOU SHOULD CHOOSE ME.

102
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:08,750
FORGET AYEKA, CAN'T YOU?

103
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:09,750
- HUH?

104
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,666
- YOU AND I COULD LEAVE
RIGHT NOW, TENCHI.

105
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,708
WE'D HAVE NO WORRIES.
JUST YOU AND I TOGETHER.

106
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,583
- RYOKO.

107
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:20,708
- SORT OF LIKE A HONEYMOON
IN DEEP SPACE.

108
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:24,375
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
IT WOULD BE FUN.

109
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:28,791
- IT SOUNDS FUN.

110
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:33,916
I'D LOVE TO GO ON A TRIP
WITH YOU.

111
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,958
- WOW.

112
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:46,375
I'M A SPACE PIRATE 
AND A POWERFUL ONE!

113
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:49,291
I COULD JUST STEAL YOU AWAY
IF I WANTED TO.

114
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:57,833
OH!  DON'T GO, TENCHI!
( crying )

115
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:03,458
PLEASE.
DON'T, I BEG YOU.

116
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,916
I CAN'T BEAR THE THOUGHT

117
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,375
OF LOSING YOU.

118
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:12,958
DON'T GO.  DON'T GO.

119
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:24,166
- BUT I WON'T FORSAKE AYEKA.
I CAN'T DO THAT.

120
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,791
- TENCHI.

121
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:29,583
- AND YOU SEE, THIS IS
MY BATTLE AS WELL NOW.

122
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,208
- TENCHI!

123
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:48,166
I CAN GIVE YOU A LIFT.
LET ME HELP YOU.

124
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,875
I KNOW THE WAY THERE.

125
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:08,125
WHAT'S UP?

126
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:12,041
- SO YOU ARE GOING
WITH HIM, AREN'T YOU?

127
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,500
- I'M GIVING HIM A RIDE
ONE WAY, THAT'S ALL.

128
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:17,541
- IS THAT ALL?  WHAT ABOUT
OUR FIGHT, RYOKO, HUH?

129
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,458
- I HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN.

130
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:22,250
WE CAN GET IT OVER WITH
RIGHT NOW IF YOU LIKE, NAGI.

131
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:28,083
( shouts )

132
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:31,625
( groaning )

133
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:35,541
- I THOUGHT SO.  WHAT DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE DOING?

134
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:36,791
WITH A SERIOUS INJURY
LIKE THAT,

135
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:39,375
YOU MAY NOT EVEN MAKE IT
TO THE PALACE.

136
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:40,958
- SHUT UP.

137
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:43,083
DO YOU WANT TO FIGHT
WITH ME NOW OR NOT?

138
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:46,291
- I DON'T TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF THE WOUNDED.

139
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:48,875
- IF THAT'S YOUR CHOICE,
THEN I GUESS I'M GOING.

140
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:50,833
YOU JUST WAIT HERE.

141
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,875
I'LL CATCH YOU LATER.

142
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:57,958
- GOOD LUCK.

143
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:18,083
- WE'LL TAKE CARE
OF THE MAIN FLEET.

144
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:20,625
YOU JUST CONCENTRATE
ON GETTING TO THE PALACE.

145
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:22,125
- I GOT IT.

146
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,625
- I REALLY DON'T KNOW HOW
LONG WE CAN KEEP THEM BUSY,

147
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:25,875
BUT YOU KNOW THAT.

148
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:28,041
THE REST IS GOING
TO BE UP TO YOU. 

149
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:29,833
- BE CAREFUL, TENCHI.

150
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:32,333
- DON'T YOU WORRY, SASAMI.

151
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:33,916
I'LL BRING AYEKA BACK
SAFELY

152
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,291
AND EVERYTHING WILL BE
JUST FINE, REALLY.

153
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:37,875
- I KNOW IT WILL.

154
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:41,500
- TENCHI, I KNOW YOUR GRANDPA
HAS GREAT FAITH IN YOU

155
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:42,833
AND SO DO I.

156
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:45,333
- DAD.

157
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:47,833
- YOU KNOW WE'LL TAKE
GOOD CARE OF GRANDPA.

158
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,250
SO YOU TAKE CARE.

159
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,750
- YEAH.  ALL RIGHT.

160
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:53,916
- THAT'S ENOUGH GOODBYES.
LET'S GO.

161
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,500
- RIGHT.

162
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:58,916
WISH US LUCK.

163
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:03,000
- GOOD LUCK AND HAVE FUN,
OKAY, TENCHI?

164
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,750
- OKAY, I THINK YOU BETTER GO

165
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,625
BEFORE THINGS GET
A LITTLE TOO NASTY.

166
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:23,958
- I WAS JUST LEAVING.

167
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:27,000
- ( screeching )

168
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:38,666
- HMM.  YEAH, I KNOW.

169
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,625
- TENCHI.

170
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:30,958
- A MESSAGE
FROM THE FRONTLINE.

171
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:32,208
"THEY'VE JUST
SPOTTED RYO-OHKI

172
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:33,791
AROUND THE FOURTH
DEFENSIVE LINE." 

173
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:36,416
- TRANSFER FLEET
TO THAT SITE IMMEDIATELY.

174
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:46,791
- WE'VE CHASED RYO-OHKI DOWN
TO THE SEVENTH SATELLITE AREA.

175
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:49,250
THEY WILL INTERCEPT RYO-OHKI
IN TWO MINUTES.

176
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:06,875
WHAT?  WHAT?!

177
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:08,166
- WHAT IS IT?

178
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,916
- IT LOOKS LIKE THERE ARE
TWO RYO-OHKIS.

179
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,291
- WHAT?  IMPOSSIBLE!

180
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:25,625
- NO, THE THE FIRST SHIP
WASN'T RYO-OHKI.

181
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,333
IT WAS ITS SHADOW.

182
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:29,291
- AH.  CLEVER.

183
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:34,875
- LOOKS LIKE THEY FELL
FOR OUR TRICK.

184
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:38,291
- WE ALL HAVE OUR PARTS TO PLAY.
- RIGHT.

185
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:40,916
- THANK GOODNESS THAT
NAGI DECIDED TO HELP US.

186
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,958
- MM-HMM.

187
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:45,250
- NOW, ENGINES FIRE!

188
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,625
- NOW LET'S GO, KEN-OHKI.

189
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:55,833
COME BACK ALIVE, RYOKO.

190
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:16,750
- ( screaming )

191
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,958
( grunts )

192
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:26,958
- HEY, RYOKO!

193
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:44,083
- ( screaming )

194
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:54,541
NO!

195
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,333
( panting )

196
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:04,708
- RYOKO.

197
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:10,000
- SORRY FOR THE DELAY.

198
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:12,250
WELL, LET'S GO.

199
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:36,333
GET OUT OF MY WAY!

200
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:50,958
- RYOKO!

201
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:55,708
- OH, TENCHI, DON'T YOU
WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING.

202
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:58,500
I SWEAR I WILL MAKE SURE YOU GET
TO JURAI'S ROYAL PALACE.

203
00:16:58,583 --> 00:16:59,625
I SWEAR IT.

204
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:11,708
DON'T BE A CHICKEN, RYO-OHKI.
WE'RE NOT COWARDS.

205
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:13,458
LET'S SHOW 'EM WHAT WE CAN DO!

206
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:39,541
( grunting )

207
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:40,541
( screaming )

208
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:58,291
OH.  THAT'S IT.

209
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:28,541
SO WE'RE HERE.

210
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,250
- THEY'RE HERE.

211
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:33,958
- ( gasps )

212
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:47,000
- FROM THIS POINT,
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN, TENCHI.

213
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,250
I HOPE YOU KNOW
I WASN'T PLANNING

214
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:52,375
ON HELPING YOU RESCUE
THAT OTHER WOMAN.

215
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:54,375
AFTER ALL, I AM A PIRATE.

216
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,375
- I OWE YOU ONE.
THANK YOU.

217
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:05,583
- YOU AIN'T GOT ALL DAY,
YOU KNOW?  YOU'RE WASTING TIME!

218
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:17,708
- WE THANK YOU FOR THE ESCORT.

219
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:21,416
- NOT EVEN 1,000 KNIGHTS COULD
MATCH YOUR SPIRIT, RYOKO.

220
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,083
- GOOD-BYE.
- GOOD-BYE.

221
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:30,750
- ( sobbing )

222
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,125
- TENCHI.

223
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,625
- WELL, RYO-OHKI,

224
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:23,833
IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S
JUST YOU AND ME AGAIN,

225
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:25,416
ALL ALONE.

226
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,000
- ( meows )

227
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:32,875
- IT'S BEEN FUN, THOUGH.

228
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:35,666
WE'VE HAD A BLAST SINCE WE FELL
ON THE EARTH, HAVEN'T WE?

229
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,250
I'M LONELY.

230
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:47,500
I SOUND SILLY, DON'T I?

231
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,708
SO WHERE SHALL WE GO NEXT?

232
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:18,333
