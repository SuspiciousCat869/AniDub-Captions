Good evening, Captain Guerrero.

Hello, Alexandra. Thanks for coming down.

00:04:08.123 --> 00:04:10.709
I had a feeling
you might want to see this.

00:04:10.792 --> 00:04:13.879
I admit, I was curious
when you described the circumstances.

00:04:13.962 --> 00:04:16.047
So, is it…

[Alexandra]
The White Lady of Balete Drive.

00:04:18.425 --> 00:04:20.635
Any witnesses, Lt. Tapia?

[Tapia] No, ma'am.

00:04:22.345 --> 00:04:26.600
But one of the neighbors positively
ID'd the victim as "Gina Santos."

00:04:26.683 --> 00:04:29.269
[Tapia] We checked it, and it turns out
she committed suicide in…

-[scrapes]

[Miranda] Death is nothing
to be afraid of, Alexandra.

00:04:57.255 --> 00:05:01.593
It is not an end, but a rebirth
to another plane of existence.

[rasps]

00:05:04.387 --> 00:05:08.308
There was a time when magic in the world
was a natural part of life.

00:05:09.601 --> 00:05:11.520
That age has passed.

00:05:11.603 --> 00:05:13.730
People fear what they don't understand.

00:05:14.397 --> 00:05:18.527
That's why our family has always been
the bridge between mankind

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.403

if she helped close a deal
with an aswang clan.

00:07:57.686 --> 00:08:02.732
[Nuno] Then I hear whispers in the tunnels
that somebody put a hit out on her.
