Can you tell me
something about mana?

00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:19,416
Yes! One thing I know is
this is how you write it.

189
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,375
See, there it is: mana.

190
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:24,000
Write it like this,
and it's "man alive."

191
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:27,083
That's right. And mana
is supernatural energy.

192
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:29,666
It's a vital force in this world
that all mages call upon.

Yeah, and everyone has it,

Everyone but me!

196
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:40,500
[FINRAL] As I was saying, mages
call upon mana to cast spells.

197
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:43,000
If you don't have enough
mana, you're out of luck.

00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:45,625
You can't use magic

First, get a length of

Yay!

320
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:13,916
[YUNO]
There's just one candle.

321
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,708
I hope that's okay.

322
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:18,750
Hooray. Happy birthday, Bell.

323
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:20,291
Pretty!

324
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:23,541
Go on, make a wish,
then blow it out.

325
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,541
[BELL]
Well, um...

326
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:28,375
Ah!

327
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:29,416
[inhales]

328
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:36,250
[BELL]
Huh? Where did the cake go?

329
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:37,833
I found it.

330
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,083
[KLAUS]
"It's Not Like I'm Worried."

331
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:46,333
[KLAUS] He's brushing each tooth
carefully and thoroughly,

332
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:48,750
ensuring maximum cleanliness.

333
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:51,250
[KLAUS gasps]
Don't scrub so roughly!

334
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,416
[KLAUS whimpers]

335
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,708
[KLAUS]
His eyes! No!

336
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,916
[KLAUS]
Safe.

337
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,250
It's a chilly night.
Is he going to catch cold?

338
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:03,916
Um, Klaus, at this
point I'm not sure

339
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
if it's sweet or just creepy.

340
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,541
Just creepy.

341
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:10,541
[YUNO]
"Family."

342
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:13,458
So. Yuno.

343
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:15,416
Is it true that, when
you make new friends,

344
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,125
you treasure them like you
would your own family?

345
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:20,916
What a lovely idea!
That sounds so wonderful.

346
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,458
Yeah.

347
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:23,750
Family.

348
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:26,333
So, does it look a little
something like this?

349
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,958
Hey, Big Brother Klaus!

350
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:32,833
[giggles] Aw, that tickles!

351
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:34,500
Little Brother Yuno.

352
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,208
I got something special for you.

353
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:38,416
[YUNO gasps]
My own glasses!

354
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,000
Wow, you're the best.
Thank you, Brother!

355
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:44,416
Yeah, no way.

356
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:48,125
[MARS]
"Long Suffering."

357
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,375
One of my more useful spells.

358
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:54,666
Flame Recovery Magic:
Phoenix Robe.

359
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,375
I have to say,
that looks quite warm.

360
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,125
It is.

361
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,166
And also rather heavy.

362
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,541
Very heavy.

363
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:18,750
What's more, if my face
itches, I can't scratch it.

364
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,125
[ASTA, NOELLE, CHARMY]
"How Come?"

365
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,416
[ASTA grumbles]

366
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,166
What's bothering you?

367
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,875
So, if that Salamander thing
was surrounded by flames,

368
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:33,041
how come Fana didn't
get burned to a crisp?

369
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:34,916
Uh, because it's magic?

370
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Okay, and when we
use Sea Dragon's Lair

371
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:39,666
to go underwater, how come
our clothes never get wet?

372
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,416
[NOELLE]
Again, it's magic.

373
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,791
And if kelp grows underwater,
then how come it doesn't

374
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,250
turn the ocean into broth?

375
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:47,291
Leave all of the
culinary questions

376
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:49,000
to the brilliant
Professor Charmy!

377
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:51,166
You see, the explanation
is quite elementary.

378
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,833
Kelp possesses a component
within its cells

379
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:54,041
known as glutamic acid.

380
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:55,708
That's the stuff that
produces a broth!

381
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:57,083
Because of a
characteristic we call

382
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:59,000
selective permeability,
kelp is able to take in only

383
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:00,791
the materials necessary
to survive and excrete

384
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:02,333
everything that's extraneous.

385
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,500
And since the broth-producing
glutamic acid helps to keep

386
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,583
the kelp alive, it remains
inside the cells until

387
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,583
the organism eventually
dries up and dies.

388
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:10,250
When that happens,
the cells burst open,

389
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,958
releasing the glutamic acid
and creating the broth!

390
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:15,750
Just say "it's magic"
and leave it at that.

391
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:20,750
[YAMI] "Captain Yami's"--
Ugh, seriously?

392
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:24,125
Why did I get stuck
doin' this crap?

393
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:27,333
Okay, so obviously the
Wizard King is at the top,

394
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:29,750
then after that you've got
your Grand Magic Knight.

395
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,041
Man, this is boring.

396
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:32,958
Shouldn't someone
lower-ranked be doin' this?

397
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:34,458
I'm gonna kill you!

398
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:36,541

[ASTA, NOELLE]
Yay!

403

[YAMI]
It's so easy, anyone can do it.

404
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:50,250
But you're not going
to cheat and use magic

405
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:53,083
like that one chef
did before, are you?

406
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:56,000
What? Just watch.

407
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:58,583
First, pull out the guts
and cut slits into it.

408

[ASTA]
Real directions!

[YAMI]
Yeah.

410
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:07,708
[YAMI] Then you season it with
salt, sugar, mirin, and ginger.

411
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:09,125
Okay.

412
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:10,250
[YAMI]
Then grill it.

413
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,166

gather more goodies

Anyway, it's over.

But wait! Asta's battle
isn't! Far from it!

459
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:56,708

more heated by the moment!

My father knew what
a knight should be.

465

And you are no Magic Knight!

466
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:48,291
[NARRATOR]
The fight pitting Asta, Mimosa,
