164
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,916
Being a Magic Knight isn't easy,

165
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,875
but I don't mind,
because I'm doing it for you.

166
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,041
And with my wages,

167
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:09,458
I can buy you the
presents you deserve.

168
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,416
[GAUCHE]
Me, a former prisoner,

169
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,125
living a life on the
straight and narrow.

170
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:26,791
It's thanks to you, Marie,
my angel made flesh.

171
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,916
I do it for you.

172
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:34,625
[GAUCHE]
Ah, my nose won't stop bleeding.

173
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,458
[SHOPKEEPER 30A]
Gauche, sir!

174
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:38,083
We've been waiting for you!

175
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:39,791
If you would please step inside.

176
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:42,708
We have presents ready
for your perusal.

177
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,041
Show me immediately.

178
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:46,208
Right away.

179
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:47,333
First up, these!

180
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:48,958
Perfect for a little girl.

181
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:50,958
They all just love
stuffed animals!

182
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:54,000
One of these would be sure
to put a smile on her face.

183
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,791
[gasps]

184
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:59,583
They're perfect! Thanks so much!

185
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:02,208
[GAUCHE groans]

186
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:03,833
[GAUCHE]
Yes! I'll take them all!

187
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:05,333
Certainly, sir!

188
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:06,458
Our next item.

189
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:08,125
She'll be playing
with this for hours,

190
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,750
imagining herself living
in such a place.

191
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:13,166
A perfect home she'd share
with her brother, naturally.

192
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,708
[gasps]

193
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:21,125
Big brother! I'm so
glad you're home!

194
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:22,750
[GAUCHE groans]

195
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,833
[GAUCHE]
I'll take that, too.

196
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,083
Excellent, sir!

197
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:29,458
Last but not least,
with this costume,

198
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:31,458
your sister can be a real angel.

199
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,125
[gasps]

200
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:38,208
You know, Gauche. I love you!

201
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:39,958
[GAUCHE groans]

202
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:44,791
[GAUCHE]
The whole store. I want it all.

203
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:47,625
[SHOPKEEPER 30A]
Always a pleasure, sir.

204
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:51,750
[MAGNA]
What?

205
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:53,916
You're visiting some girl
you met at a mixer?

206
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,416
Sure am. I promised
Rebecca I'd come play

207
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,458
with her brothers
and sisters sometime.

208
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:00,625
Go, Asta. You're a fast mover,

209
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:03,458
already bringin' the whole
family in on your date.

210
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:05,083
I'm proud of you, buddy.

211
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:05,916
Yeah!

212
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,041
Hey. Look, Nean's up ahead.

213
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,458
[ASTA]
All right!

214
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:11,708
I'm gonna play so hard,
they won't know what hit 'em!

215
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:14,250
[MAGNA]
Whoa, heh, take it easy, boy.

216
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:28,916
[GAUCHE] Greetings, my beloved
little sister Marie.

217
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,125
Please forgive your brother,

218
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:32,291
whose blood loss
has made him tardy.

219
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,875
I've bought you so
many birthday presents.

220
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:37,625
I hope they will
bring you great joy.

221
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:41,125
[GAUCHE]
All my wages are gone now,

222
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:45,458
but no price is too high
for your happiness.

223
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:49,333
Soon I'll see my
precious angel again,

224
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:51,583
and that smiling face of hers.

225
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:54,166
Ah! My darling Marie!

226
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,458

[laughing]

229
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:05,000
[ASTA]
You like that, huh, Marie?

230
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:09,458
[MARIE] So fun! You're
really strong, Asta!

231
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:10,708
I want a turn!

232
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:11,541

[gasps]

236
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:21,125
Get away from her
right now, you scum.

237
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,875
Oh, it's the bloody-nosed
sister-lover!

238
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:26,333
[GAUCHE] Call me a bloody-nosed
sister-lover again, meathead.

239
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:28,166
I'll squash you!

240
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:31,041
That isn't gonna happen--
not the way I've been training!

241
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:31,666
[laughs]

242
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,541
[GAUCHE]
Shut up.

243
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,833
[GAUCHE] I only get to see
my sister once a month,

244
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:38,541
which means these
visits are sacrosanct.

245
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,375
Today I set aside
all other thoughts,

246
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:43,291
ready to dote on my Marie
in every way possible.

247
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,916
It was supposed to be flirty
and fun and perfect.

248
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,583
So how is it that you
showed up here before me?

249
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:50,458
[ASTA]
So you do have a sister complex

250
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:51,833
and get nose bleeds.

251
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:54,791
And how was I supposed to know
she was your sister?

252
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,416
[GAUCHE] Stop pointing your
grubby little finger

253
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,625
at my angel!

254
00:12:57,708 --> 00:13:00,000
I know I showed you
her picture, don't lie!

255
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,708
Did you? I don't remember.

256
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:03,791
I met her today when
I came over to Rebecca's

257
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:05,458
to play with her
brothers and sisters.

258
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:06,958
Uh, hi.

259
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:08,708
[PIM]
He's really scary!

260
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:11,208
What's "flirty" mean?
I don't know that word.

261
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,250
Shh!

262
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,583
Well, Marie's cute,
that's for sure.

263
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,666
Of course she's cute,
but that doesn't mean

264
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:20,541
you have permission to make
eyes at my sister, you filth!

265
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,458
Stop, big brother!

266
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:25,375
I don't want you doing
mean things to him! Please!

267
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:27,750
Asta's going to be
my husband someday!

268
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:29,833
[echoing] Asta's going to
be my husband someday!

269
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:35,000
Asta's going to be
my husband someday...!

270
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:41,083
[NOELLE]
Her husband?!

271
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:42,458
When I tagged along with them,

272
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:45,500
that was <i>not</i> what
I was expecting!

273
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:48,250
Uh, the fare, miss?

274
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,500
[NOELLE]
Will this be enough?

275
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:51,750

00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,000

00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:57,583
[GAUCHE]
Kill. Kill...

279
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:58,416

Hey? What are you doing
with that mirror?

Please stop! Don't hurt him!

[SISTER THERESA] Oh, my.
It's awfully noisy out here.

288
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:24,458
Marie, it's time to go.

289
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:26,625
You need to get back
to the church now.

290
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:28,125
[MARIE]
Sister!

291
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:30,500
I see. So you're here, Gauche.

292
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:31,875
That's right, hag.

293
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,750
[SISTER THERESA]
That's "Sister" to you.

294
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:35,583
Mind your manners.

295
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,708
[GAUCHE]
Marie and I are going on a date.

296
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,833
You can head back to
the church on your own.

297
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,750
No, Gauche. She's coming.

298
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:44,750
The sooner you accept that,
the better for us all.

299
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,125
When are you going to realize

300
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,625
that you're no good for
an impressionable young girl

301
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,083
like Marie?

302
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:52,583
She deserves to be around
somebody better than you,

303
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:55,083
with your bad attitude
and nasty tongue.

304
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:56,583
What was that, you old crone?

305
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:57,458
[SISTER THERESA]
There, see?

306
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:59,708
Just drop dead.

307
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:01,833
A nice thing to say
to an old woman

308
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:03,958
nearing the end of her life,
thoughtless fool.

309
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:06,875
Says the demon witch who'll
live for another 100 years.

310
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,291
Or two, or three.

311
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:11,083
Only a thug would resort
to that sort of name calling.

312
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:13,208
Shut up, you worthless bag!

313
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:14,666
Hold on a sec!

314
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,208
You can't just talk
to an elderly woman

315
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,708
of the cloth like that!
It's just wrong!

316
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:20,250
[GAUCHE] Nobody asked
you to get involved.

317
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:21,666
Now back off!

318
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,458
[SISTER THERESA] Just go home.
Come along now, Marie.

[MARIE] Bye, Gauche!
Bye, Asta! I had fun!
