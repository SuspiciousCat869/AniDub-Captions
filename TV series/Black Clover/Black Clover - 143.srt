The Clover Kingdom.

00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,450
In this place where
magic is everything,

3
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,410
there lives a magicless
boy named Asta.

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,250
This brave young hero devotes
blood, sweat, and tears

5
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:24,370
to becoming the
next Wizard King.

6
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:27,830
Though Asta's situation
is practically unheard of,

7
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:29,870
there are others
residing in this kingdom

8
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:32,540
who possess at least
a tiny amount of mana,

9
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:35,040
yet can barely
use spells at all.

10
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,750
They make up
a very small minority,

11
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,250
living their lives
in the shadows.

12
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,580

But, like everyone else,

13
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:49,160
they do their best to survive.

[NARRATOR] With help from
Bow, another resident,

23
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,080
Dazu confronted a member of the
Magic Parliament named Kabwe.

24
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,870
Kabwe despised devils.

25
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:39,950
And after Damnatio delayed the
trial for Nero, Asta, and Marie,

who were facing judgment for
their involvement with one,

he believed the situation
was being handled poorly,

28
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,910
which caused him to
become even more enraged.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,870
And so, the group took action.

30
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,950
Under the name
"Devil Banishers,"

31
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,500
they abducted Marie
from the church in Nean.

[SIONA] You won't be escaping
again, servant of the devil.

33

servant of the devil?

But still, there is
some good news.

76
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:47,950
He should sleep
for a very long time.

Doctor. I need to know
that Asta's still alive!

Don't worry, he's alive.
Just sleeping.

If that's true, then why
won't he open his eyes?

80
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:07,330
I mean, what if they put him
under a spell that causes him

81
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:10,330
to sleep forever or something?

82
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:12,290
[OWEN]
No. I can confidently say

00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:14,580
he's not sleeping
because of a spell.

mean when you said

00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,080
he wasn't sleeping
because of a spell?

Listen, quack,
you better not tell us

00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,580
it's a sleeping potion or
something stupid like that.

Actually, yes, it is.

Trust me, I'm as
surprised as you are.

Not sure who made it,

99
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:54,120
but it was a ridiculously
powerful concoction.

100
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,750
But why would anybody have
something like that on them?

101
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,160
[OWEN]
That, I don't know.

102
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,200
In any case, he should
wake up on his own

103
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:04,040
after he rests for
a little while longer.

Thank goodness.

105
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,040
Well, I guess we can say
one thing for sure:

106
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,620
if they put him to sleep,

107
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,410
that probably means they weren't
out to murder the kid, right?

108
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,750
Makes sense.

109
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:16,120
First, we should find out
exactly what happened.

[GAUCHE] Dammit, you

That's right. The third time

Remember? First,

then there was this whole
trial thing, and now this!

That's three strikes, sister!

outrank you, that's just mean!

00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,790
I could say that it happened

while I was away
from the church,

an excuse. Either way.

I have to imagine there's
something you can do

126
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:03,790
that would be more proactive
than strangling an old woman.

Am I gonna...

153
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,700
That was all.

154
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:13,000
Leave it to him to fall
for that obvious trick.

155
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,370
To tell the truth...

156
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:18,200
The spells they were using
weren't all that powerful.

157
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:20,540
Maybe they were trying to be
discreet so that the other

158
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:25,000
Black Bulls wouldn't pick up
on their mana or something.

160
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,790
when they came to the hideout.

161
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,120
[crash, rumbling]

162
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:40,290
[OWEN] Honestly, Yami,
was that really necessary?

163
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:42,580
Not only did these
evil bastards attack the base

164
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,290
while I wasn't around,
but they had the balls

165
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:46,120
to kidnap a member of my squad!

166
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,660
I don't know who they they are,

167
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,120
but screwin' with me was the
biggest mistake of their lives.

168
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,450
[rumbling]

169
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,370
[MARX]
What was that noise out there?

170
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:04,870
What's wrong, sir?
Did you hear that? Uh...

171
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,330
I'm beginning to think doors

172
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:19,830
are a foreign concept
to the Black Bulls.

173
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,450
Where's my sister?

174
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,750
[DAMNATIO]
Whatever do you mean?

175
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,160
Has something happened to Marie?

176
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,120
Don't give me that!

177
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,250
You abducted her again,
I know you did!

178
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,250
You can't be serious.

179
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:35,290
Don't you dare
play dumb with me.

180
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:36,950
I assure you, I'm not.

181
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,660
Although... You've
been impertinent.

182
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,080
And for that,
you must be judged.

183
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:48,200
Gentlemen, I suggest
you step back.

184
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:49,450
[MAGES]
Yes, sir.

185
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,250
[gasps]

186
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,870
[GAUCHE]
He did this last time.

187
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:01,250
[DAMNATIO]
Scale Magic: Scale Regulate.

188
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:04,950
You were imprisoned once,

189
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,080
and it seems I'll have to
put you behind bars again.

190
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,790
[GAUCHE]
Try it and see what happens!

191
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,200
Mirror Magic: Reflect Ray!

192
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,500
Are you all right, sir?

193
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:22,290
[BOTH] Casting Mirror
Magic: Real Double!

194
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:25,200
[DAMNATIO] He used a mirror
to clone himself?

195
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:26,370
[GAUCHES]
I already saw you pull

196
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:29,330
that dumb little trick
during the trial.

197
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:32,660
It's not gonna work
for you this time, buddy.

198
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,450
It seems you've
underestimated me.

199
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,080
[DAMNATIO]
On your knees!

200
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,910
The hell is this?

201
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:49,450
Seize these two, immediately.

202
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,660
[MAGES]
Yes, sir!

203
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,000
[YAMI]
Are you trying to terrorize

204
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,950
every member of
my squad, or what?

205
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,700
I don't care how much
you despise the guy,

206
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:22,080
you can't just go rogue
on me like that!

207
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,000
What's worse, I don't recall
giving you permission

208
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,120
--to hijack my wheels!
--[FINRAL] Right, wheels.

209
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,660
Do you know how much
mana I had to waste

210
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:31,200
draggin' myself all
the way over here?

211
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:34,200
[NOELLE] I'm pretty sure
it was easy, but okay.

212
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:36,330
Why are you two accosting him?

213
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,580
Because this is the second time

214
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,790
this mole-faced freak
kidnapped my sister!

215
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,450
[ALL gasp]

216
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,540
Not true.

217
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,330
[GAUCHE]
Well, who the hell did, then?

218
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:46,000
I know what those guys
with the masks

219
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,830
were saying when they took her.

220
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,540
Something about
returning the scale

221
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,830
to the light after it
tipped into darkness.

222
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:55,700
That's exactly the kind of crap
that you talk about!

223
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:58,700
Wait a minute. Did you say
those guys were wearing masks?

224
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,370
What's the difference?

225
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,500
Were they or not?

226
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,000
[GAUCHE]
Well, I think so.

227
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,870
I wasn't there, but...

228
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:11,410
[GAUCHE]
So, they didn't just take Marie?

229
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,500
[YAMI] They didn't get
the kid, but Nero's gone.

230
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:17,160
[GAUCHE]
That means it <i>was</i> you!

231
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:21,620
What led you to that conclusion?
I'm not following your logic.

232
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,830
First Marie, then you
took Asta and Nero.

233
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:28,370
All the ones
who were on trial!

234
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:29,580
You were trying to take justice

235
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,870
into your own hands,
weren't you, creep?

236
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:34,870
Listen, I don't really care
what you do to Asta and Nero.

237
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,500
That's kinda messed up!

238
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,250
[GAUCHE]
Just give Marie back!

239
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:40,450
Now then, Marx.

240
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:43,120
If you would show them
my memories, please.

241
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,160
All right, I will.

242
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,580
Tch.

243
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,120
In a few moments,
my innocence will be proven,

244
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,750
and then you will pay severely
for the way you've insulted me.

245
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,620
It's clear from his memories.

246
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,660
He knew nothing
about any of this.

247
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,450
So obviously,
I couldn't possibly

248
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,700
have been involved
in the situation.

249
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,290
Not only did you attack me,

250
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:20,200
but you also accused me
of a heinous crime.

251
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:23,910
I hope you're prepared to
assume full responsibility.

252
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,160
[GAUCHE] Fine. Do
whatever you want to me.

253
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:30,660
But it'll have to wait until
Marie gets back safe.

254
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:34,330
[DAMNATIO] What makes you think
you have any right to negotiate?

255
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,290
Hold on, now.

256
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:44,500
The guy we saw
in your memories.

257
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,950
You know, the one you
were arguing with.

258
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,660
You'd think he would've popped
in durin' all this ruckus.

259
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,370
[DAMNATIO]
Hm.

260
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:54,540
[chiming]

261
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,290
I'm here, sir.

262
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:58,120
Is something wrong?

263
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,620
[JULIUS]
I'm sorry to interrupt you all,

264
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,700
but there's something I need
Yami and his group to see.

265
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,370
Listen, we're a little busy--

266
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:06,750
[JULIUS] He should
be arriving any moment.

267
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,290
[NOZEL]
Pardon me.

268
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:14,450
It's my brother.

269
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,120
[JULIUS] Remember,
at the start of this mess,

270
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,620
we put a special
communication bracelet on Asta

271
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,910
to keep track of his
location at all times.

272
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,250
[NOZEL] We're getting a signal
from the town of Tiulyu,

273
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:30,040
in the Common Realm.

274
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,500
What does that mean?

275
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:34,040
Did someone take it off of him?

276
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,120
The only ones who even
knew about that bracelet

277
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,910
are the people who were
in the room when we did it.

278
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,250
And the only person
I can think of

279
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:42,160
who'd be able to get that
thing off would be Nero

280
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,040
with her Sealing Magic.

281
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,040
Perhaps she did remove it,
and now she's trying

282
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,200
to use the signal to broadcast
her whereabouts to us.

283
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:52,080
And I bet if we find her,
we'll find Marie. Finra--

284
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,120
[YAMI]
Finral! Let's go!

285
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:57,290
Yeah, so I hate to tell ya this,

286
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:00,200
but I've actually
never been to Tiulyu.

287
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:02,750
Guess we'll just have to
travel there by broom then.

288
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:04,500
Captain.

289
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,540
Allow me to accompany you.

290
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:09,910
After all, my best friend's
sister is basically my sister.

291
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,790
Hell no!

292
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:13,080
Say that again, and you're dead!

293
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,250
This may be a trap.

294
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:15,700
Should we really take that risk?

295
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:18,250
No one asked you, fungus head!

296
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:19,790
I don't care if it <i>is</i> a trap,

297
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:22,700
it's the only clue we
have to go on right now!

298
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,410
[YAMI]
I agree with Gauche.

299
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,160
We gotta check it out.

300
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,450
Hold on.

301
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:31,450
[DAMNATIO] I haven't
finished my conversation

302
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:34,040
with this insufferable
criminal yet.

303
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,080
[GAUCHE]
Oh, yeah?

304
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,040
Get your head out of your ass!

305
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,700
There's more important
stuff goin' on here!

306
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,870
[JULIUS]
Yami.

307
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:42,910
Did I or did I not
order the Black Bulls

308
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
to keep an eye on Nero?

309
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,790
You did.

310
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:50,410
[JULIUS] They're called
the Devil Banishers, yes?

311
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,080
Well, you can't exactly
watch over her

312
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,160
until you get her back
from them, can you?

313
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:58,200
So, Damnatio, I'll have
to ask you to withhold

314
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:00,120
your judgment for
a while longer.

315
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,120
Is that all right?

316
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,370
Yes, I suppose so.

317
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:05,120
[JULIUS]
I'm counting on you, Yami.

318
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,370
Right.

319
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:08,500
[JULIUS] Oh, yes, and
there's one more thing.

320
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,330
We don't have all day here!

321
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:12,290
[JULIUS]
I understand tensions are high,

322
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:14,500
since one of your own
has been abducted.

323
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,910
But remember, this isn't
like what happened

324
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,410
with the Magic Parliament.

325
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,950
With this many unknowns,

326
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,330
one wrong move could put
your squad in grave peril.

327
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:34,200
No need to tell me.

328
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:37,500
Enough talk. Ready? Let's go!

329
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,250
[BLACK BULLS]
Yes, sir!

330
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:40,620
I'll go with you.

331
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,120
Huh?

332
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,080
Didn't see that coming.

333
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,660
Why are you taking
the time to help us out

334
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,910
when your squad's
so busy training?

335
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,700
We need every Magic
Knight in the kingdom

336
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,700
to help defeat the evil,
and I don't want to lose

337
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,910
anyone between now and then.

338
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,750
No more, no less.

339
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:05,950
Come on, we all know you're just
worried about your sister.

340
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,080
Stop trying to act
like Mr. Badass.

341
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,500
It's gettin' old.

342
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,660
If you say one more word,
then I won't hesitate

343
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,500
to send you plummeting
to your death, foreigner.

344
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,000
So much for that fancy speech

345
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,500
about not wantin'
to lose anyone.

346
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,540
[GAUCHE]
There it is.

347
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:31,700
It's destroyed.

348
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,500
It's probably one
of the many areas

349
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,290
that were attacked by the
Eye of the Midnight Sun.

350
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,870
[GAUCHE]
I'll be right there, Marie!

351
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:48,040
The signal.

352
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,330
Yeah, where is it?

353
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:53,580
[cuffs rattling]

354
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,910
I'm guessing that's
another magic item

355
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,290
that prevents mana tracking,
like the one I have?

356
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:00,870
Yes, just to be safe.

357
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:04,700
I doubt anyone'll find us way
out here, but it doesn't hurt.

358
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:12,040
[NOZEL] It appears they're doing
their best to block the signal.

359
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,540
Do you think they know
about the bracelet?

360
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,870
It's possible.

361
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:18,950
Either way, we'll be wise
to proceed with caution.

362
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:26,580
Did we really have to land
this far away from them?

363
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,910
Are you stupid?

364
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Uh--

365
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,500
I doubt it'll just
be Nero and Marie.

366
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,830
I'm sure the kidnappers
are keeping an eye on them.

367
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,410
Do you honestly
think it would work

368
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,450
if we barge in there
without a plan?

369
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,870
Huh.

370
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:39,790

[GAUCHE]
Yeah?

372
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:44,200
You got a picture of
your little sister on you?

373
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:46,000
What the hell do you
want it for?!

374
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,200
Relax, weirdo.

375
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:50,580
We need it to ask people
if they've seen her!

376
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,120
That makes sense.

377
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,700
[YAMI]
Mm-hm.

378
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,000
I need all of them back!

379
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,080
[YAMI] We don't know
what these guys might do.

380
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:05,620
So nobody go into town alone.
Remember to watch yourselves!

381
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,500

You're not my sidekick.

Don't be embarrassed,
we work great together!

385
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,950
Let's go, Noelle.

386
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,160
Okay!

387
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,620
Well. I guess it's me and you.

388
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,250
Y'got a problem with that?

389
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:23,580
What? No, of course not.

390
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,870
No one's come to help them?

391
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:41,540
We only have so many forces
we can send to make repairs.

392
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:45,620
[GORDON]
It's strange.

393
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,580
This place obviously suffered
some serious damage.

394
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,080
And yet...

[FINRAL]
Wow.

396
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,580
I know, there's
so many graves here,

397
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,040
you can't count 'em all.

398
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,540

after the big attack.
