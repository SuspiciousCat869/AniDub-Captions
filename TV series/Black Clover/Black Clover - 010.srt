00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:13,375
[NARRATOR] Asta, Noelle,
and Magna travelled

2
00:00:13,458 --> 00:00:16,125
to Saussy Village to
rid the area of boar.

3
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:18,500
There, they encountered
a mysterious foe.

4
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:19,791
Though the three Magic Knights

5
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:21,500
fight bravely to
protect the villagers

6
00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:23,166
from the enemy's
vicious attacks,

7
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,958
his magic power is far too great

8
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:27,041
for even their
strongest efforts.

9
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:28,958
So, it can not
only cancel magic--

10
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:31,666
that sword of yours can
reflect it, as well.

11
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,666
But you're a fool if you
think that will defeat me.

12
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:37,791
I can create wave after
wave of icy fangs.

13
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:40,666
Go on. Let's see
you protect them.

14
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,916
[yells]

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,916
[MAGNA]
Damn this guy!

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,458
Asta and I have our hands full
keeping the villagers safe.

17
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:52,416
What's more, my magic
is startin' to run out.

18
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,666
This is turning out to be

19
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:56,250
a hell of a first
mission for those two.

20
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:58,083
Things are goin' south quick.

21
00:00:58,166 --> 00:01:00,500
But if all that was enough
to make me give up,

22
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:04,041
I wouldn't be a man! Here we go!

23
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:05,083
Your fellow commoner

24
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:08,000
is gonna keep you
safe and sound!

25
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:09,708
[NOELLE]
What's wrong with me?

26
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:11,625
Even though I'm royalty...

27
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:14,791
Even though I have more
magic power than anyone here...

28
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:17,125
Stay behind us, Noelle!

29
00:01:17,208 --> 00:01:19,708
[NOELLE] I'm only
holding the others back.

30
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:23,625
[LOU] Miss Magic Knight,
please help us!

31
00:01:25,625 --> 00:01:27,500
We need you!

32
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:28,833
[gasps]

33
00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:30,875
[NOELLE] This little girl
is looking me in the eye

34
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:33,375
and begging for help.

35
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:36,000
I have to protect her!

36
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:38,791
I won't run! Never!

37
00:01:40,708 --> 00:01:43,958
[NOELLE]
That looks like... a new spell?

38
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:49,041
[NOELLE] Water Creation Magic:
Sea Dragon's Lair!

39
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:53,625
[VILLAGERS gasp]

40
00:01:53,708 --> 00:01:56,291
[NARRATOR] A grimoire evolves
along with its owner,

41
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:59,625
new spells appearing as
the mage grows stronger.

42
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:01,916
This growth chiefly
refers to an increase

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,625
in magic power through training

44
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:06,666
or to improved handling
of said magic power.

45
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,541
However, it may also occur
in cases of heightened

46
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:14,125
or altered emotions, or
accompany great determination.

47
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:17,625
[NOELLE] I will protect
them. I am royalty.

48
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:18,666
What's more,

49
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,333
I am a member
of the Black Bulls!

50
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:59,833
[gasps]

51
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:01,916
[LOU]
You're amazing!

52
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,708
[VILLAGERS gasping, yelling]

53
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,666
Well, that wasn't
so difficult, after all.

54
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,083
[MAGNA]
That is one serious spell.

55
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:16,250
There, see?

56
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:17,666
You'll never know
what you're capable of

57
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,833
until you're willing
to give it a try.

58
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:21,458
That's impossible.

59
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:24,333
How can she have so much power?

60
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:27,708
[NARRATOR] On the sidelines,
the beast was watching.

61
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:31,166
Waiting for his
chance to strike.

62
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,000
To seize the enemy
by the throat.

63
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:34,208
[ASTA yells]

64
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,250
[NARRATOR]
And in that moment...

65
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,500
[HEATH]
Consider yourself.

66
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:42,875
You have enough magic power to
have joined the Magic Knights.

67
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:46,208
I don't have a single
drop of magic power.

68
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:50,041
But that doesn't matter.
I'll still destroy you!

69
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,583
[BOTH]
No! Master Heath!

70
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:58,041
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout!

71
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:01,375
Did... he get him?

72
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:02,625
[gasps]

73
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:05,583
[HEATH chuckles]

74
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:11,125
[ASTA] Oh, no. I slipped on his
ice and killed my momentum!

75
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:14,166
That sword of yours may
be able to nullify magic,

76
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,541
but that can only go so far

77
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:18,208
when it's wielded
by an ordinary human.

78
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,375
Now it's my turn to
take a stab at you.

79
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:29,750
[gasps]

80
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:41,541
[HEATH] Sleep, little fool.
For all eternity.

81
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:44,541
[MAGNA gasps]
Asta.

82
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:48,416
[HEATH] There is tremendous
magic power behind this spell.

83
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,625
Still, it's just
a matter of time.

84
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:53,333
I ought to be able
to create an entrance

85
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:56,208
wide enough for at least
one person to pass through.

86
00:05:58,541 --> 00:05:59,666
[NOELLE gasps]

87
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:03,750
This should take
approximately 25 seconds.

88
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,083
[HEATH] You pesky creatures
certainly do enjoy

89
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,458
wasting my time, don't you?

90
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:14,916
But, oh, the price you will pay.

91
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,375
[pants]

92
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,875
[MAGNA] I don't have
much magic power left,

93
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:21,500
but I can't give up.

94
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:23,250
Flame and ice.

95
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:26,166
Going by our magics' attributes,
I have the upper hand.

96
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,750
Still...

97
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:29,083
The difference in
our power is enough

98
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,166
to flip that on its head.

99
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:34,541
We picked the wrong
guy to take on.

100
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,583
Sorry, Yami, sir,

101
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:41,375
but I think this may be
one fight that I can't win.

102
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,083
I'm not done yet!

103
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:44,416
Too late.

104
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:47,166
[gasps]

105
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,958
Asta!

106
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,166
So, that last strike
didn't kill you off.

107
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,708
You're a tough little idiot.

108
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,416
However, your wounds

109
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,041
will make swinging
that sword difficult.

110
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:01,083
[ASTA]
I'm not done!

111
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:03,083
And I'm no boar to be pinned.

112
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:05,000
[ASTA screams]

113
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:10,875
[grunting]

114
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:19,791
[ASTA]
I'm not done yet! Got that?

115
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:22,250
Hmph. How persistent.

116
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:24,958
But you're gonna regret
wasting my time.

117
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,333
[FRIEND 10A]
You're amazing, Magna!

118
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:31,583
[VILLAGERS laughing]

119
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:33,208
[FRIEND 10B]
Never thought I'd see the day!

120
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:34,458
I can't believe there's gonna be

121
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:37,333
a real Magic Knight from
sleepy little Rayaka.

122
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:39,708
From street thug to the
village's golden boy!

123
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:42,291
[FRIEND 10A]
Let's give 'im a cheer!

124
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:48,541
[VILLAGERS]
Magna! Magna! Magna!

125
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:53,791
[SEIHI]
Really? You did it, huh?

126
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:57,041
Wonderful! I knew that
you could make the cut.

127
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:58,458
Yeah.

128
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:01,833
This means you're not just
some street punk anymore.

129
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:07,583
Well, go on, take it.

130
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,375
Uh, thanks.

131
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:15,875
Whatcha think?

132
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:18,500
[SEIHI] Mm-hm. It looks
good on you, all right.

133
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:21,000
Now, go be the man
I know you can be.

134
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,250
Right!

135
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:27,916
I've got this.
I'll do it, Seihi.

136
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,458
I'm not going to give up yet.

137
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:33,625
[MAGNA grunts]

138
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:36,375
[MAGNA] A real man hangs on
till the bitter end.

139
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:38,791
Noelle. This spell of yours.

140
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:41,375
We can get outside of it
easily enough, right?

141
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,875
Well, yes, I would imagine so.

142
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:47,125
You stay here and look after
the villagers, got it?

143
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:49,625
Hey! What are you doing?

144
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:52,625
You stand no chance
of prevailing against me.

145
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:54,916
Why not accept that and give up?

146
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,750
If I gave up now, then who
would protect them?

147
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:01,250
[VILLAGERS gasp]

148
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,166
[ASTA]
I realized something.

149
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,666
[HEATH]
Hm?

150
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,875
Sooner or later, I'm going
to be the Wizard King.

151
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:10,458
But it's not just about
keeping a promise.

152
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:12,916
It's about keeping people safe!

153
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,208
You think you'll be
the Wizard King?

154
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:17,708
What an utterly
ridiculous dream.

155
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:21,250
Especially considering that
you'll be dead in one minute.

156
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:24,458
[MAGNA]
That's not gonna happen, Frosty.

157
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:30,791
If you wanna go
after him, just try it.

158
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:32,625
I'll give ya fair
warning, though.

159
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:35,958
In order to do that,
you gotta go through me!

160
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,750
What are you doing, Magna?

161
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:39,458
[MAGNA laughs]

162
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:40,666
You and me--

163
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,333
we're the real men here, Asta.

164
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,750
Reckless fool.

165
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:47,708
Going out of your way
to die an early death.

166
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:49,625
You have 30 seconds.

167
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:55,416
[MAGNA]
Bring it on! You ready, Asta?

168
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:58,833
Time for a baptism.

170
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,083
[MAGNA]
Here we go.

00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:06,250
All the magic power
I've got left!

172
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:11,291
Now, my Soul Ball.

175
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:26,000
[HEATH] This is the final
spell of your pathetic life?

176
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,166
What a complete waste.

177
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:30,500
[MAGNA grunts]

178
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:32,625
[HEATH]
Your time is up.

179
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:39,416
[ASTA]
You wish!

180
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,541
[HEATH]
That wasn't the real attack.

181
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,666
He's reflecting the spell.

182
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:51,041
I'm alive.

183
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,250
[NOELLE] Hmph. You can
thank me for it later,

184
00:10:58,333 --> 00:10:59,500
lowly street punk.

185
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:00,791
[NOELLE]
Oh, my gosh, I did it!

186
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:04,166
I actually controlled
my magic power!

187
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,833
Never can keep your
mouth shut, can ya?

[HEATH]
These flames...

190
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,583
They aren't going out.

191
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,708
No matter. I'll
just freeze them.

[HEATH gasps]

195
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:24,208
[ASTA] As long as I can
still move, I'm not done!

196
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:26,208
No. You can't.

197
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:27,750
Like hell!

[HEATH]
These flames...

201
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,000
They aren't going out.

202
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:52,166
No matter. I'll
just freeze them.

207
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,666
No. You can't.

208
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,125

[HEATH]
No... Impossible...

00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,125
Me? Bested?

212
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:18,500
And by this... boy?

213
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:24,583
If only I could have been
more use to the master, but...

[VILLAGERS gasping]

215
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,541
He did it.

216
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,083
[LOU]
Are we safe?

217
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:35,583
[NOELLE]
Yes. He can't hurt you now.

218
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,208
It's over.

219
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:51,166
What started as Flame Magic:
Prison Death Scattershot,

220
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,708
will now become

221
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:57,000
Flame Binding Magic:
Flame Bondage Formation!

222
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:59,125
You're better at this than
you look like you'd be,

223
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:00,875
I can give you
that much, anyway.

224
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:03,041
How 'bout you shut that
royal mouth of yours

225
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:05,291
and quit looking down
on your superior!

226
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:07,125
Once again, you just
happen to be below me, so...

227
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:08,041
[ASTA]
Magna, sir!

[growls]

230
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,625
[NOELLE]
Seems, your follow-through

231
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:19,083
leaves much to be desired, sir.

232
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,875
Uh--

233
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:23,791
[VILLAGERS yelp]

It's freezing!

[MAGNA laughs] Oh, ho-ho! What
was that about follow-through?

236
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,791
I can't believe
one of 'em got away!

237
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,541
How'd that happen? Dammit!

238
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:43,500
[ASTA]
How do ya like that?

239
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:47,083
I may be a commoner, but I won!

00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:50,208
Yeah! How do you like that, huh?

[MAGNA]
Sleeping? Seriously?

245
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:06,958
He is such a fool,
and a reckless one, at that.

246
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:11,666
An idiotic, obnoxiously
loud commoner.

247
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,583
But, he's also kind of amazing.

[ASTA snoring]

249
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:18,458
He saved us.

00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:19,958
I thought we were done for.

251
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:22,208
He's still just a kid, too.

[VILLAGER 9A]
Do ya think he's really

253
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:25,625
just a commoner like us?

254
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:26,666
Thanks, Magna.

255
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:29,250
And you, miss. For everything.

Sure, that's why we're here.

We're simply doing our duty.

[VILLAGER 9C] Still, we'll never
forget what you did for us.

Huh?

[MAGNA] Hey, about time you
woke up, you sadistic jerks.

262
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:25,250
And now...

263
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,041
We just gotta wait till
my power comes back.

264
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:30,458
When it does, Crazy Cyclone's
hauling you to the capital.

Hmph.

You're gonna pay, I promise you.

267

You'll spend the
rest of your lives

makin' up for what
you did today.

[HEATH] This spell of his
appears to be blocking my magic.

Just wait, you're gonna
spill everything.

Who you people are,
what you're after.

get every last

scrap of information outta you!

[HEATH]
They will not.

275
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:57,208
The end times are upon us.

Magic Item inside him?

[ASTA, MAGNA, NOELLE gasp]

280
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,250
They were willing
to go that far?

281
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:25,500
Must've sworn some serious
loyalty to someone.

282
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:31,625
[growls] What was he thinking?

283
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:34,541
[MAGNA] To sacrifice
them all like that...

284
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,750
What was his game, anyway?

285
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:41,000
[ASTA]
How could they?

286
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:44,541
Treating life like it's
something to throw away.

287
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,166
Like death is nothing.

288
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,875
I'll never understand
these people.

289

Grandpa...

We should go home
now. Please, Nick.

00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:13,041
[NICK]
In a bit, okay?

293
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:16,041
Grandpa always liked
the view from up here.

294
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:22,291
Yeah. I heard what
happened. What Seihi did.

295
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,500
He fought those men.

296
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,916
He did what he could
to protect the village.

297
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,375
[NICK]
Uh-huh.

[panting]

301
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,208
Your grandpa was amazing.

302
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:56,166
He was a real man.

303
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,083
[NICK] You should've heard
him tell the story

304
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:00,250
about gambling in the capital.

305
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:03,791
He was so happy, 'cause he
had beaten some Magic Knights.

306
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,791
Yeah.

307
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:08,416
He even used some of the
money to buy presents,

308
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,875
and he brought lots
of yummy food

309
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:12,583
for everyone in the
village to share.

310

[NICK]
He never got to become one,

311
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,916
but Grandpa would've loved
to be a Magic Knight

312
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,041
more than anything in the world.

313
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:25,750
Yeah, I know.

314
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:29,000
[NICK] And, he regretted
it his whole life.

315
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:31,208
What did he regret?

316
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:33,791
[NICK] He said he should've
worked harder when he was young,

317
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:36,166
then maybe his dream
would've come true.

Nick...

319

[NICK sniffles] But, even
though he didn't make it in,

320
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:44,666
he was happy 'cause
you worked hard enough

321
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,375
for the both of you.

322
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:49,041
Yeah.

323
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:49,916
Magna.

324
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,250
Could I...

325
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:52,833
Do you think...

326
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:55,541
Can I be a Magic Knight,
too, someday?

327
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:57,375
Of course you can!

328
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:59,041
[gasps]

329
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:01,666
Just remember,
nothing's impossible.

330
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,541
You can do anything, Nick.

331
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,541
Your future's what
you make of it.

332
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:06,958
He's totally right.

333
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:09,083
I mean, I'm a commoner
with no magic power,

334
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:10,291
and look at me now.

335
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:13,166
A knight! It won't be easy.

336
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,041
Get ready to sweat!

337
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,708
You're gonna have to work hard.

338
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:19,041
And always do your best.

339
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:23,333
Just wait, by the time you
get into the Magic Knights,

340
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:25,791
I'll have worked even harder,
accomplished even more,

341
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:29,250
and gotten even closer to
becoming the Wizard King.

342
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:32,583
Please, let's not get
into that nonsense again.

343
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:35,083
But, hey, point is, dream big.

344
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,458
That's what a real man does.

345
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:43,000
We'll be waiting
for you. Got it?

346
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:44,250
Yeah!

347
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:45,500

against my head, featherbrain?

352
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:01,708
Oh, it's on now! I'll get you!

353
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:06,208
[ASTA]
What's that stone?

354
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:08,250
Hey, I recognize that.

355
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:11,166
It's the charm Grandpa used
to carry around with him.

356
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,916
Give it back, you,
this is something special.

357
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,375
Come on, bird, just let it go.

358
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:17,333
What d'you even need a rock for?

359

[laughs]

360
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:20,916
It's okay.

361
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,250
Your bird can keep
it if he wants to.

362
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:26,166
It's the least I can do
after how you saved us.

363
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,500
Yeah? Okay, thanks.

Just look at those hateful eyes.

365
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:38,291
He is so adorable!

366
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:40,583
You could sit on me
if you'd like.

Hm?

Not again!

Quit pecking me, psycho-bird!

00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:49,250
What'd I do to you?
Hey, get back here!

371
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,583
I'm gonna fry you up for dinner!

Very well.

00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:24,208
And the magic stone is now in
the hands of the Black Bulls?

379
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:25,541
Yes, sir.

380
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:28,583
No matter.

381
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:30,583
The Black Bulls
won't be an issue.

382
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,916
We can deal with
them at any time.

383
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,291
They can keep the magic stone

384
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:36,958
until we are ready
to retrieve it.

Not long now.
