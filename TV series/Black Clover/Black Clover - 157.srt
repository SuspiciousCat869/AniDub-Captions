00:00:22,512 --> 00:00:24,472
[NARRATOR]
The Clover Kingdom.

2
00:00:24,556 --> 00:00:27,058
In this place where
magic is everything,

3
00:00:27,142 --> 00:00:30,228
there lives one boy
who was born without it.

4
00:00:30,311 --> 00:00:33,356
His name is Asta.

5
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,774
His strength and determination

6
00:00:34,858 --> 00:00:36,776
helped him become
a Magic Knight.

7
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,362
And despite the many
challenges he faces,

8
00:00:39,446 --> 00:00:43,324
he aims for the top
and refuses to give up!

9
00:00:43,408 --> 00:00:44,951
Rich or poor,

10
00:00:45,035 --> 00:00:46,953
royalty or commoner,

11
00:00:47,037 --> 00:00:49,831
Asta believes anyone can shine.

12
00:00:49,914 --> 00:00:52,751
His mission is to prove
that to the whole world,

13
00:00:52,834 --> 00:00:55,545
and to become the
next Wizard King!

14
00:00:57,922 --> 00:00:59,466
[NARRATOR] In preparation
for the coming war

15
00:00:59,549 --> 00:01:02,635
with the Spade Kingdom, Asta and
his comrades train diligently

16
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,679
with the Heart Kingdom's
Spirit Guardians.

17
00:01:04,763 --> 00:01:07,098
Now halfway into
their training period,

18
00:01:07,182 --> 00:01:09,934
the Magic Knights have learned
the Heart Kingdom's Mana Method

19
00:01:10,018 --> 00:01:12,896
and are growing steadily.

20
00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:16,232
Since Asta has no magic,
he sparred with Gaja,

21
00:01:16,316 --> 00:01:19,611
seeking insights that might
lead to a new technique.

22
00:01:19,694 --> 00:01:21,780
Meanwhile, in the
Clover Kingdom,

23
00:01:21,863 --> 00:01:25,075
Yami finally learned the
trick to using Mana Zone.

24
00:01:27,327 --> 00:01:28,661
[NARRATOR]
And now...

25
00:01:29,746 --> 00:01:33,458
[ASTA]
Gaja! Guess who's back for more?

26
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:35,210
Very impressive.

27
00:01:35,293 --> 00:01:38,713
It seems you've grown quite
a bit these past few days.

28
00:01:38,797 --> 00:01:40,131
Yeah!

29
00:01:40,215 --> 00:01:42,425
Yesterday, I had a scrap
with the Wind Spirit Guardian.

30
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:44,052
He helped me train my ki,

31
00:01:44,135 --> 00:01:47,013
so I'm way better at
reading sneaky attacks now.

32
00:01:47,097 --> 00:01:49,391
And today, I fought the
Earth Spirit Guardian,

33
00:01:49,474 --> 00:01:51,393
and she has super sharp
senses and she helped me

34
00:01:51,476 --> 00:01:53,978
hone my fighting
instincts like "wa-bam!"

35
00:01:54,062 --> 00:01:55,647
Wait, I thought you
were supposed to be

36
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:56,898
training with Luck?

37
00:01:56,981 --> 00:01:58,900
He's taking some time
to see what he can learn

38
00:01:58,983 --> 00:02:01,611
from the other Spirit
Guardians, so it's just me.

39
00:02:01,695 --> 00:02:03,613
I came at the right time then.

40
00:02:03,697 --> 00:02:05,865
Spar with me! I wanna
try out what I've learned.

41
00:02:05,949 --> 00:02:08,868
I'm perfectly willing
to fight more.

42
00:02:08,952 --> 00:02:11,705
But before we start,
let's talk a bit.

43
00:02:11,788 --> 00:02:13,623
Even by arcane stage standards,

44
00:02:13,707 --> 00:02:16,835
a mage who has no magic
is quite the anomaly.

45
00:02:16,918 --> 00:02:19,504
What's even stranger about
you is the astounding rate

46
00:02:19,587 --> 00:02:21,089
at which you've grown.

47
00:02:21,172 --> 00:02:22,841
So that I might aid
you on your quest

48
00:02:22,924 --> 00:02:26,761
for even greater strength, I'd
like to ask you some questions.

49
00:02:26,845 --> 00:02:29,848
Please tell me about your
life up until this point.

50
00:02:29,931 --> 00:02:31,349
And share whatever you know

51
00:02:31,433 --> 00:02:33,852
about the devil
in your grimoire.

52
00:02:33,935 --> 00:02:36,813
Okay then. This
might take a while.

53
00:04:10,865 --> 00:04:12,450
[ASTA]
Father Orfai says he took in me

54
00:04:12,534 --> 00:04:15,954
and my childhood friend
Yuno on the same day.

55
00:04:16,037 --> 00:04:18,123
We were just babies when
were dropped on his doorstep

56
00:04:18,206 --> 00:04:22,377
in Hage village, on the
outskirts of the Clover Kingdom.

57
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:25,088
Time passed, and
eventually, we grew up.

58
00:04:25,171 --> 00:04:28,425
[ASTA]
Sister Lily!

59
00:04:28,508 --> 00:04:31,219
Will you please marry me?

60
00:04:31,302 --> 00:04:34,639
[ASTA] In those days, I lived
with my beloved Sister Lily,

61
00:04:34,723 --> 00:04:35,724
Yuno,

62
00:04:35,807 --> 00:04:38,560
and all the other orphaned kids.

63
00:04:38,643 --> 00:04:39,978
Back then, my biggest problem

64
00:04:40,061 --> 00:04:42,897
was that I couldn't
use any magic at all.

65
00:04:42,981 --> 00:04:46,192
While Yuno's got so much of the
stuff, he does laundry with it.

66
00:04:46,276 --> 00:04:47,444
[ASTA]
That's right!

67
00:04:47,527 --> 00:04:49,404
I'm gonna get the most
awesome grimoire ever!

68
00:04:49,487 --> 00:04:51,031
I'll join up with
the Magic Knights,

69
00:04:51,114 --> 00:04:52,782
and once I make
a name for myself,

70
00:04:52,866 --> 00:04:56,995
I'll follow in your footsteps
and become the Wizard King!

71
00:04:57,078 --> 00:04:59,706
[ASTA] Each March, kids turning
15 gather from all over

72
00:04:59,789 --> 00:05:02,250
the kingdom to be given
grimoires, and Yuno and I

73
00:05:02,334 --> 00:05:05,378
were finally old enough
to receive our own.

74
00:05:12,802 --> 00:05:14,179
[ASTA]
But...

75
00:05:14,262 --> 00:05:16,181
Hey, uh...

76
00:05:18,433 --> 00:05:21,728
Is my grimoire running
late or something?

77
00:05:22,896 --> 00:05:25,732
[TOWER MASTER]
Er... Try again next year?

78
00:05:25,815 --> 00:05:28,234
What?!

79
00:05:28,318 --> 00:05:30,528
[laughs] Oh, wow,
you're kidding!

80
00:05:30,612 --> 00:05:32,697
[TEEN BOY 1J]
That's actually kinda awesome.

81
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:36,534
[ASTA] Yuno ended up getting
a four-leaf grimoire,

82
00:05:36,618 --> 00:05:39,037
just like the
First Wizard King had.

83
00:05:39,996 --> 00:05:42,916
[ASTA]
I was so sure, all this time.

84
00:05:42,999 --> 00:05:44,167
I just needed a grimoire,

85
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,545
and then I'd finally
be able to use magic.

86
00:05:47,629 --> 00:05:50,507
And now, to not even
get a grimoire.

87
00:05:55,804 --> 00:06:00,058
[ASTA]
No! I won't give up that easily!

88
00:06:00,141 --> 00:06:04,020
[laughs] You're not winning
this round, fate.

89
00:06:04,104 --> 00:06:06,147
Don't underestimate me!

90
00:06:06,231 --> 00:06:08,525
It doesn't matter if it takes
a year, or two, or ten,

91
00:06:08,608 --> 00:06:10,360
or 100! I don't care!

92
00:06:10,443 --> 00:06:12,904
I'll work till
I get that grimoire!

93
00:06:14,114 --> 00:06:16,825
[ASTA] But then this thieving
jerk showed up outta nowhere

94
00:06:16,908 --> 00:06:18,952
and attacked Yuno
with his Chain Magic.

95
00:06:19,035 --> 00:06:22,956
He stole Yuno's grimoire
and was planning to sell it.

96
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,290
[REVCHI]
Oh-ho.

97
00:06:24,374 --> 00:06:26,918
I bet that pendant would
fetch a good price.

98
00:06:27,002 --> 00:06:28,294
Don't mind if I do.

99
00:06:28,378 --> 00:06:29,504
[ASTA]
Hold it!

100
00:06:33,633 --> 00:06:36,011
[ASTA] I fought hard to
get Yuno's grimoire back,

101
00:06:36,094 --> 00:06:37,429
but despite all my training,

102
00:06:37,512 --> 00:06:40,181
I was no match for
the thief's magic.

103
00:06:40,265 --> 00:06:42,684
He taunted me
for my helplessness,

104
00:06:42,767 --> 00:06:46,271
saying that his chains could
measure anyone's magic power

105
00:06:46,354 --> 00:06:48,356
and that I didn't
have a single drop.

106
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,900
[REVCHI] This world has
no use for someone like you,

107
00:06:50,984 --> 00:06:52,694
a poor, magic-less fool.

108
00:06:52,777 --> 00:06:55,071
You might as well give
it all up right now.

109
00:06:55,155 --> 00:06:58,033
You were born a loser,
you worthless runt.

110
00:06:58,116 --> 00:07:00,660
[ASTA]
Yeah. He's right.

111
00:07:00,744 --> 00:07:02,912
No matter how hard I try,

112
00:07:02,996 --> 00:07:06,666
I guess there are some things
that just aren't possible.

113
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,377
So... I might as well give u--

114
00:07:09,461 --> 00:07:12,630
[YUNO] Hey! Who are
you calling a loser?

115
00:07:12,714 --> 00:07:15,258
Asta, it's true that you
aren't going to become

116
00:07:15,342 --> 00:07:17,761
the Wizard King. Not ever.

117
00:07:17,844 --> 00:07:19,137
[REVCHI]
You hear that?

118
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,681
Even your little friend
knows that it's impossible.

119
00:07:24,434 --> 00:07:27,854
That's because <i>I</i> am going
to be the Wizard King.

120
00:07:27,937 --> 00:07:29,522
[REVCHI]
What?

121
00:07:29,606 --> 00:07:34,944
You're wrong about Asta,
Revchi. Very wrong.

122
00:07:35,028 --> 00:07:37,489
Asta's no loser. He's my rival!

123
00:07:37,572 --> 00:07:38,782
[ASTA gasps]

124
00:07:38,865 --> 00:07:41,618
Huh? This is who you
would claim as your rival?

125
00:07:41,701 --> 00:07:45,246
The only person in the
world without magic?

126
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:48,249
You. Get off of me.

127
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:49,793
[REVCHI gasps]

128
00:07:49,876 --> 00:07:53,421
[ASTA] Sorry you had to see me
at such a weak moment, Yuno.

129
00:07:53,505 --> 00:07:56,007
Just give me a second.

130
00:07:56,091 --> 00:07:58,843
[ASTA] That's all.
Then I'll destroy this guy.

131
00:08:00,553 --> 00:08:02,972
[ASTA] And then,
right when I needed it,

132
00:08:03,056 --> 00:08:05,975
the five-leaf grimoire,
said to have a devil inside it,

133
00:08:06,059 --> 00:08:07,977
appeared in front of me.

134
00:08:08,061 --> 00:08:09,896
Back then, I didn't
know anything about

135
00:08:09,979 --> 00:08:12,023
the devil's powers
or the Anti-magic

136
00:08:12,107 --> 00:08:13,692
that I was about to use.

137
00:08:13,775 --> 00:08:16,861
I was offered a sword,
and I took it.

138
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:31,418
[ASTA]
So, yeah.

139
00:08:31,501 --> 00:08:32,752
That's more or less
the whole story

140
00:08:32,836 --> 00:08:37,215
of how I came to be the
wielder of this grimoire.

141
00:08:37,298 --> 00:08:38,925
After that, me and Yuno left.

142
00:08:39,009 --> 00:08:42,595
We took the Magic Knights
Entrance exam at the capital.

143
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:45,598
Yuno ended up joining the most
powerful and popular squad,

144
00:08:45,682 --> 00:08:47,726
the Golden Dawn.

145
00:08:47,809 --> 00:08:49,019
I was almost sent home

146
00:08:49,102 --> 00:08:51,146
since I had no
magic to speak of.

147
00:08:51,229 --> 00:08:54,232
But then Captain Yami
let me join the Black Bulls.

148
00:08:54,315 --> 00:08:55,984
If I'm remembering correctly,

149
00:08:56,067 --> 00:08:58,111
the captain of the Black Bulls
fights with a sword,

150
00:08:58,194 --> 00:08:59,279
just like you.

151
00:08:59,362 --> 00:09:01,990
Yeah! He takes a crazy
long time to poop,

152
00:09:02,073 --> 00:09:04,617
but he still manages to be there
for us when we need him!

153
00:09:04,701 --> 00:09:06,578
He's really strong,
and it's thanks to him

154
00:09:06,661 --> 00:09:08,163
that I can use my ki.

155
00:09:08,246 --> 00:09:12,125
The point is that he's someone I
have a whole lot of respect for!

156
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,835
Once the rest of the
Black Bulls accepted me

157
00:09:13,918 --> 00:09:16,296
as a part of the squad,
I got my cape and embarked

158
00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:18,256
on my first official mission.

159
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,133
That took me and my
squadmates to the dungeon

160
00:09:20,216 --> 00:09:23,887
where I found my second weapon:
the Demon-Dweller Sword.

161
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,056
We also faced off with
one of the Diamond Kingdom's

162
00:09:26,139 --> 00:09:28,391
Eight Shining Generals, Mars.

163
00:09:28,475 --> 00:09:30,560
This guy was an
insanely strong mage

164
00:09:30,643 --> 00:09:33,188
who had two different
magical attributes.

165
00:09:33,271 --> 00:09:35,815
It was during that battle
that I realized:

166
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:39,778
[ASTA] I may not have any magic
power, but what I do have

167
00:09:39,861 --> 00:09:41,446
are my friends!

168
00:09:43,239 --> 00:09:45,742
[ASTA] I borrowed mana
from Noelle and released it

169
00:09:45,825 --> 00:09:47,786
using the Demon-Dweller Sword.

170
00:09:47,869 --> 00:09:52,248
And that was enough to break
through Mars's diamond armor.

171
00:09:52,332 --> 00:09:54,959
Afterwards, when we reported
back on the mission,

172
00:09:55,043 --> 00:09:57,420
we met the Wizard King.

173
00:09:57,504 --> 00:09:58,755
"Get results.

174
00:09:58,838 --> 00:10:01,424
A noble heart alone
can't protect anyone.

175
00:10:01,508 --> 00:10:04,761
And the trust of the people
is earned, not granted."

176
00:10:04,844 --> 00:10:06,721
With the Wizard King's
words in my heart,

177
00:10:06,805 --> 00:10:10,809
I protected whoever I could
and I beat lots of bad guys.

178
00:10:10,892 --> 00:10:14,688
But then, I met
a bad guy like no other.

179
00:10:14,771 --> 00:10:17,607
[PATRY] I haven't introduced
myself yet, have I?

180
00:10:17,691 --> 00:10:21,027
I am the leader of the
Eye of the Midnight Sun.

181
00:10:21,111 --> 00:10:22,821
Call me Licht.

182
00:10:32,706 --> 00:10:35,291
[ASTA] His light magic
was insanely fast.

183
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:37,544
It was able to hit me
before I could react

184
00:10:37,627 --> 00:10:39,587
or even see it coming.

185
00:10:39,671 --> 00:10:42,716
But thankfully, Captain Yami
showed up to save me.

186
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:45,593
He faced Licht head on,
batting his light magic away

187
00:10:45,677 --> 00:10:46,845
like it was nothing.

188
00:10:46,928 --> 00:10:49,264
I always knew Yami was
strong, but watching him

189
00:10:49,347 --> 00:10:52,350
fight Licht proved it
in a whole new way!

190
00:10:52,434 --> 00:10:54,644
[YAMI]
Hey, kid! Were you watching?

191
00:10:54,728 --> 00:10:56,229
Uh, yes, Captain!

192
00:10:56,312 --> 00:10:57,230
[YAMI]
That's good.

193
00:10:57,313 --> 00:10:58,648
Because now it's your turn.

194
00:10:58,732 --> 00:11:00,358
Yes, sir!

195
00:11:00,442 --> 00:11:03,903
Wait, what did you say?
There's no way I can do that!

196
00:11:03,987 --> 00:11:07,240
Yeah? Last I checked,
I was still your captain.

197
00:11:07,323 --> 00:11:10,785
Which means, if I tell you
to do something, you do it.

198
00:11:10,869 --> 00:11:13,621
Assuming you wanna be a
real man someday, Shrimpsta.

199
00:11:13,705 --> 00:11:16,082
[ASTA] Captain Yami told me that
he wasn't just reacting

200
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:18,460
to Licht's attacks,
he was predicting them

201
00:11:18,543 --> 00:11:20,628
by sensing Licht's "ki."

202
00:11:20,712 --> 00:11:25,258
"A person's glance, their
breathing, their scent,

203
00:11:25,342 --> 00:11:28,345
the way their muscles move,
the hint of their presence.

204
00:11:28,428 --> 00:11:31,348
Taken together, all of that
living energy people give off.

205
00:11:31,431 --> 00:11:32,515
That's called ki."

206
00:11:32,599 --> 00:11:34,476
All I've been doing
is reading his ki

207
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:37,187
and using it to
predict his moves.

208
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,981
You've never done
anything like that before?

209
00:11:40,065 --> 00:11:42,692
[gasps] Actually, yeah.

210
00:11:43,693 --> 00:11:45,570
[ASTA] The captain's
lesson was so intense

211
00:11:45,653 --> 00:11:47,572
that I could've died
in the middle of it.

212
00:11:47,655 --> 00:11:48,698
But in the end,

213
00:11:48,782 --> 00:11:51,826
I learned how to sense ki.

214
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,244
How interesting.

215
00:11:53,328 --> 00:11:56,289
This "ki" sensing technique
seems to be well-suited

216
00:11:56,373 --> 00:11:59,376
to a warrior who lacks
magic such as yourself.

217
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:01,711
Your Captain Yami
must have anticipated

218
00:12:01,795 --> 00:12:03,672
that such a tool
would prove useful

219
00:12:03,755 --> 00:12:05,173
as you improve your Anti-magic.

220
00:12:05,256 --> 00:12:07,759
Come to think of it, yeah,
you're probably right.

221
00:12:07,842 --> 00:12:09,219
Oh! Holy crap!

222
00:12:09,302 --> 00:12:10,929
Captain Yami's so friggin' cool!

223
00:12:11,012 --> 00:12:13,890
Though it's possible I'm
simply overthinking this.

224
00:12:13,973 --> 00:12:16,685
By the way, there's another
question I'd like to ask you.

225
00:12:16,768 --> 00:12:17,686
[gasps]

226
00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:19,229
It's a simple one.

227
00:12:19,312 --> 00:12:21,898
What do you have to do to enter
that special fighting state

228
00:12:21,981 --> 00:12:24,943
where the power of your devil
manifests in your body?

229
00:12:25,026 --> 00:12:28,446
Heh. Funny story.

230
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:29,989
The first time
I took on that form

231
00:12:30,073 --> 00:12:31,241
was in the Forest of Witches,

232
00:12:31,324 --> 00:12:34,619
after visiting the
queen who rules there.

233
00:12:34,703 --> 00:12:36,788
I was fighting
this smirky creep

234
00:12:36,871 --> 00:12:39,791
from the Diamond Kingdom
who had attacked the forest.

235
00:12:47,465 --> 00:12:52,429
[ASTA]
My magic is never giving up!

236
00:13:04,441 --> 00:13:07,318
Damn you! It can't be!

237
00:13:07,402 --> 00:13:10,822
My magic should have
made me invincible!

238
00:13:10,905 --> 00:13:12,073
[ASTA]
To be honest,

239
00:13:12,157 --> 00:13:13,908
I didn't understand what
was happening any better

240
00:13:13,992 --> 00:13:16,286
than the guy I was fighting did.

241
00:13:16,369 --> 00:13:20,331
[LADROS]
No! No, no, no, no, no, no!

242
00:13:20,415 --> 00:13:21,958
It's not fair!

243
00:13:22,042 --> 00:13:25,920
I stepped on so many people
to get to where I am now!

244
00:13:26,004 --> 00:13:28,423
I can't lose to you!

245
00:13:28,506 --> 00:13:31,676
[ASTA] You always kicked
your friends down,

246
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,387
but my friends
helped me be better.

247
00:13:34,471 --> 00:13:36,181
Stronger!

248
00:13:39,309 --> 00:13:41,853
[ASTA]
Black Meteorite!

249
00:13:41,936 --> 00:13:44,022
[LADROS screams]

250
00:13:53,573 --> 00:13:55,658
[ASTA] I didn't figure out
how to take that form at will

251
00:13:55,742 --> 00:13:58,536
till I was at Yultim Volcano,
a strong magic region

252
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,872
we went to for a training camp.

253
00:14:00,955 --> 00:14:03,166
Since I couldn't use
mana skin, a technique

254
00:14:03,249 --> 00:14:05,794
where you protect your body
by wrapping it in mana.

255
00:14:05,877 --> 00:14:09,964
I was stopped in my tracks
by the super intense heat.

256
00:14:10,048 --> 00:14:11,800
But then I realized something!

257
00:14:11,883 --> 00:14:14,552
I could use the ki technique
I had learned from Captain Yami

258
00:14:14,636 --> 00:14:17,305
to amplify the Anti-magic
inside my body

259
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:19,516
and create an Anti-magic
version of Mana Skin

260
00:14:19,599 --> 00:14:21,643
that worked just as well!

261
00:14:21,726 --> 00:14:23,186
And with that same method,

262
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:24,813
I can enter that
heightened state of being

263
00:14:24,896 --> 00:14:26,648
anytime I want to!

264
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:29,401
I'm a lucky guy!

265
00:14:29,484 --> 00:14:31,528
Captain Yami's done
so much for me!

266
00:14:31,611 --> 00:14:33,071
I don't know what I
would've done if he had

267
00:14:33,154 --> 00:14:34,781
never taught me
how to use my ki!

268
00:14:34,864 --> 00:14:37,117
For real!

269
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,785
Check out this sword.

270
00:14:38,868 --> 00:14:40,912
The Demon-Destroyer Sword.

271
00:14:40,995 --> 00:14:42,956
It's a pretty wild one,
but thanks to my ki,

272
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:44,416
I can handle it.

273
00:14:44,499 --> 00:14:47,460
I hear that sword goes beyond
nullifying magic itself.

274
00:14:47,544 --> 00:14:50,005
It can also reverse
the effects of a spell.

275
00:14:50,088 --> 00:14:52,716
Such a power has
great potential.

276
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:55,010
Yup!

277
00:14:55,093 --> 00:14:57,345
I got the Demon-Destroyer
Sword around the time

278
00:14:57,429 --> 00:15:00,390
we launched our attack on the
Eye of the Midnight Sun's base.

279
00:15:00,473 --> 00:15:03,184
This was just before
our final battle with them.

280
00:15:04,477 --> 00:15:07,063
[ASTA] Things were going well,
but then that "Disloyal" guy

281
00:15:07,147 --> 00:15:09,190
fully reincarnated
and attacked us,

282
00:15:09,274 --> 00:15:12,235
along with some of our
newly possessed friends.

283
00:15:12,318 --> 00:15:14,738
Not long after that,
we ended up fighting the leader

284
00:15:14,821 --> 00:15:17,073
of the elves in the
center of their base.

285
00:15:19,576 --> 00:15:20,952
[ASTA]
His ki.

286
00:15:21,036 --> 00:15:23,413
[YUNO]
That sword's got massive power!

287
00:15:23,496 --> 00:15:24,664
[ASTA]
Uh-oh.

288
00:15:24,748 --> 00:15:27,083
I can't stay in this
form much longer.

289
00:15:27,167 --> 00:15:29,419
Come on, just a little more!

290
00:15:29,502 --> 00:15:31,838
Asta. Careful, all right?

291
00:15:31,921 --> 00:15:34,466
Yeah. I know that.

292
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,978
[YUNO]
Asta!

293
00:15:48,063 --> 00:15:49,689
[ASTA] It turned out that
the leader of the elves

294
00:15:49,773 --> 00:15:51,941
was the original
owner of my swords,

295
00:15:52,025 --> 00:15:54,527
so he was able to use
their full power.

296
00:15:54,611 --> 00:15:57,072
On top of that,
he was insanely strong.

297
00:15:57,155 --> 00:15:57,947
But...

298
00:15:58,031 --> 00:16:00,325
[ASTA]
I'm not done yet!

299
00:16:00,408 --> 00:16:02,786
You're not killin' Yuno!

300
00:16:02,869 --> 00:16:05,372
Or Asta, either!

301
00:16:05,455 --> 00:16:08,416
[BOTH]
He's my rival!

302
00:16:12,754 --> 00:16:14,756
[ASTA]
Even with Yuno, I couldn't win.

303
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:17,342
But when I least expected it,
the Demon-Destroyer Sword

304
00:16:17,425 --> 00:16:21,096
I had picked up became
a part of my grimoire.

305
00:16:21,179 --> 00:16:22,514
Thanks to that,

306
00:16:22,597 --> 00:16:24,599
I was able to nullify the
Poison magic that was used

307
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:27,352
on the people of Hage Village

308
00:16:27,435 --> 00:16:29,396
and return everyone who
had been reincarnated

309
00:16:29,479 --> 00:16:31,564
into elves back to normal.

310
00:16:32,816 --> 00:16:34,901
[ASTA] Afterwards,
in the Shadow Palace,

311
00:16:34,984 --> 00:16:37,237
the memories that the
Demon-Destroyer had absorbed

312
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,863
flooded into me.

313
00:16:38,947 --> 00:16:41,533
That's when I found out about
the massacre of the elves.

314
00:16:41,616 --> 00:16:45,453
And not long after, I learned
that all the chaos, violence,

315
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:50,542
and hatred I had just witnessed
had a single source.

316
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,460
It all began with a devil.

317
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:54,295
[KOTODAMA DEVIL]
Word Soul Magic:

318
00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:57,424
"Voizuiinemidoren."

319
00:16:57,507 --> 00:17:00,135
[ASTA] His goal was to leave
the world that devils come from

320
00:17:00,218 --> 00:17:02,012
and appear in ours
in his full form,

321
00:17:02,095 --> 00:17:03,638
with nothing to hold him back.

322
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:05,932
I couldn't let that
bastard have his way.

323
00:17:06,016 --> 00:17:07,684
I had to stop him!

324
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:12,939
[ASTA] If Yuno could evolve,
then so could I!

325
00:17:13,023 --> 00:17:17,152
[ASTA] Anti-Magic Demon
Slayer Sword: Black Divider!

326
00:17:19,696 --> 00:17:22,782
[BOTH yell]

327
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:31,332
[YAMI] Dark Cloaked,
Dimension Slash: Equinox!

328
00:17:35,378 --> 00:17:37,589
[ASTA] Nero used her
Sealing Magic to lock away

329
00:17:37,672 --> 00:17:39,174
the damage I had taken.

330
00:17:39,257 --> 00:17:40,842
Asta.

331
00:17:40,925 --> 00:17:43,094
Remember.

332
00:17:43,178 --> 00:17:46,181
You're going to be
the Wizard King!

333
00:17:47,891 --> 00:17:49,351
Yeah!

334
00:17:54,898 --> 00:17:58,318
[ASTA]
Right here, right now.

335
00:17:58,401 --> 00:18:01,529
I'm going to push
past my limits!

336
00:18:10,705 --> 00:18:12,707
[ASTA] I'm pretty sure
you know the rest.

337
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:15,168
I was put on trial for
cooperating with a devil,

338
00:18:15,251 --> 00:18:16,878
but they set me free in the end.

339
00:18:16,961 --> 00:18:19,798
I came here to the Heart Kingdom
to investigate a devil's curse,

340
00:18:19,881 --> 00:18:23,009
hoping it would help me prove
my innocence back home.

341
00:18:23,093 --> 00:18:24,469
Then I found out
that the devil's curse

342
00:18:24,552 --> 00:18:28,431
in the Heart Kingdom is on
Queen Loropechika herself.

343
00:18:28,515 --> 00:18:29,766
I will get stronger,

344
00:18:29,849 --> 00:18:31,768
'cause that's my
only path forward.

345
00:18:31,851 --> 00:18:33,728
I'll protect all
the people I can.

346
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:35,230
Back home.

347
00:18:35,313 --> 00:18:38,066
And here in the
Heart Kingdom, too.

348
00:18:38,149 --> 00:18:40,527
I'm glad that you allowed
me to hear your tale.

349
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:42,487
It was truly enlightening.

350
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:45,323
I finally understand how
you became so powerful,

351
00:18:45,407 --> 00:18:49,119
despite the fact that you're
utterly spurned by mana.

352
00:18:50,203 --> 00:18:52,080
[GAJA]
Now, let us begin.

353
00:18:52,163 --> 00:18:55,792
The sun will be setting shortly,
but we can spar nonetheless.

354
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,877
I'll train you
as long as you'd like.

355
00:18:57,961 --> 00:18:59,838
In the dark, if need be.

356
00:18:59,921 --> 00:19:01,548
Ooh, right!

357
00:19:09,389 --> 00:19:11,016
[NOELLE yells]

358
00:19:25,196 --> 00:19:27,073
[yells]

359
00:19:31,619 --> 00:19:34,372
Excellent! Noelle, that
was a sight to behold!

360
00:19:34,456 --> 00:19:35,957
You put on quite the show.

361
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,917
I think anyone could see
that you've improved

362
00:19:38,001 --> 00:19:39,377
since you first arrived here.

363
00:19:39,461 --> 00:19:41,796
Well, since I'm royalty myself,

364
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,757
I'm a fairly quick study.

365
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,050
[NOELLE]
I can't believe it!

366
00:19:45,133 --> 00:19:47,302
She actually praised me!

367
00:19:47,385 --> 00:19:49,304
In truth, you're the
one who's amazing,

368
00:19:49,387 --> 00:19:50,722
Water Spirit Undine.

369
00:19:50,805 --> 00:19:53,475
You keep finding new ways
to draw out more and more

370
00:19:53,558 --> 00:19:54,851
of my water magic.

371
00:19:54,934 --> 00:19:57,145
[giggles] Thank you
for the compliment,

372
00:19:57,228 --> 00:19:59,689
but you aren't the only
one who's growing fast.

373
00:19:59,773 --> 00:20:01,316
Take a look at this.

374
00:20:03,526 --> 00:20:04,861
[LOROPECHIKA]
It's not just you and Nero.

375
00:20:04,944 --> 00:20:07,155
Your comrades from the
Clover Kingdom are learning

376
00:20:07,238 --> 00:20:10,158
Heart Kingdom techniques faster
than we ever could've imagined.

377
00:20:10,241 --> 00:20:13,244
They're all getting stronger
just as fast as you are.

378
00:20:13,328 --> 00:20:15,622
We may be fast, but we
still aren't as strong

379
00:20:15,705 --> 00:20:20,043
as we need to be to defeat
the devil in the Spade Kingdom.

380
00:20:20,126 --> 00:20:21,503
Right?

381
00:20:21,586 --> 00:20:23,588
Yes. You're exactly right.

382
00:20:23,672 --> 00:20:26,633
That said, I have complete
faith in each of you.

383
00:20:26,716 --> 00:20:28,093
The Magic Knights
who are training

384
00:20:28,176 --> 00:20:31,221
so diligently here, and your
comrades who stayed behind

385
00:20:31,304 --> 00:20:34,432
to help prepare the
Clover Kingdom for war.

386
00:20:34,516 --> 00:20:36,643
If we all work together,
then in time,

387
00:20:36,726 --> 00:20:39,354
a ray of hope will break through
the Spade Kingdom Devil's

388
00:20:39,437 --> 00:20:41,147
cloud of despair.

389
00:20:41,231 --> 00:20:43,983
In fact, I'm certain
that we'll win.

390
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,615
[NOELLE] And when we do,
I'll avenge my mother.

391
00:20:58,581 --> 00:20:59,874
[yells]

392
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,711
You shouldn't expect the
same trick to work twice.

393
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:07,382
[ASTA screams]

394
00:21:12,303 --> 00:21:14,305
That move is strong,
but as it is now,

395
00:21:14,389 --> 00:21:16,224
you can only land a hit
with it reliably

396
00:21:16,307 --> 00:21:18,476
if you catch your
opponent by surprise.

397
00:21:20,437 --> 00:21:22,856
Seems we'll finish before dark.

398
00:21:22,939 --> 00:21:26,901
[GAJA]
Lightning Magic: Tenjiolia.

399

Not yet!

[NARRATOR]
The leaves of a clover are said

401
00:21:31,406 --> 00:21:33,324
to each contain one thing.

402
00:21:33,408 --> 00:21:37,037
In the first three dwell
integrity, hope, and love.

403
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,872
The fourth leaf is given
over to good luck.

404
00:21:38,955 --> 00:21:40,206
[gasps]

405
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:44,753
[NARRATOR] And in the fifth,
there lives a devil.

406
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:51,051
[panting]

407
00:21:51,134 --> 00:21:52,969
[ASTA]
Wait, my sword?

408
00:21:53,053 --> 00:21:54,429
What the--?

409
00:21:56,222 --> 00:21:59,934
Your capacity for growth
continues to surprise me.

410
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:02,687
In order to reveal the extent
of your hidden powers.

411
00:22:02,771 --> 00:22:04,981
I'll attack you with
everything I have.

412
00:22:05,065 --> 00:22:07,984
That is, if you think
you can withstand more.

413
00:22:08,068 --> 00:22:10,111
Yeah, gimme
everything you've got!

414
00:22:12,739 --> 00:22:15,909
[yells]

415
00:22:18,661 --> 00:22:21,581
Things are starting
to get interesting now.

416
00:22:21,664 --> 00:22:23,500
[laughs]

417
00:23:57,302 --> 00:23:59,679
[ASTA] Our training's finished,
and it's finally time

418
00:23:59,763 --> 00:24:01,222
to fight the Spade Kingdom.

419
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:04,059
Next time on
<i>Black Clover</i> , Page 158:

420
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:06,186
"The Beginning of
Hope and Despair."

421
00:24:06,269 --> 00:24:08,396
I'll protect everyone
in the Clover Kingdom,

422
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,690
and everyone in the
Heart Kingdom, too!
