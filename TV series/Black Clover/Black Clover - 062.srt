1
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:15,625
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:18,500
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:24,375
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:27,000
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,541
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:39,625
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,916
[NARRATOR]
The Eye of the Midnight Sun

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,125
attacked the Forest of
Witches for a magic stone.

9
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:48,708
During the chaos, the
Diamond Kingdom's army

10
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:52,000
arrived to steal a secret spell
from the Queen of Witches.

11
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:54,083
[LADROS]
Million Lasers!

12
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:57,750
I think I'll start by killing
this noisy little witch!

13
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:01,125
Domina!

14
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:02,333
[DOMINANTE gasps]

15
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:05,791
Everything that you said...

16
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:07,541
Well, I guess it
finally hit home.

17
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:09,750
[NARRATOR] That's when Mars,
member of the Diamond army

18
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:11,708
and Fanzell's former student,

19
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:13,791
decided to rethink
his loyalties.

20
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:15,833
Why would you help us?

21
00:01:15,916 --> 00:01:19,458
Ladros is right. The two
of us are traitors!

22
00:01:19,541 --> 00:01:21,375
I mean, losing your memories...

23
00:01:21,458 --> 00:01:23,000
Not to worry, sir.

24
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,166
I've decided I'm on your side.

25
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:28,375
Bounce it over here!

26
00:01:28,458 --> 00:01:30,916
Don't see why, but sure!

27
00:01:35,833 --> 00:01:38,166
[NARRATOR] Thanks to Asta's
anti-magic, our friends

28
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,708
were finally able
to defeat Ladros.

29
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:42,625
But Fana of the Midnight Sun,

30
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:45,125
despite being hit with
Noelle's water magic,

31
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:46,958
proved more difficult to subdue.

32
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:48,958
Fana!

33
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:50,125
It's me, remember?

34
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:52,041
Please tell me you
still recognize me!

35
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:55,000
I know that girl! I taught her!

36
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:57,166
[NARRATOR]
Confused by her memory loss,

37
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,625
Fana prepared to self-destruct.

38
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:03,208
[FANA]
Everything must be destroyed.

39
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:05,500
[NARRATOR] But as Mars and
Asta fought desperately

40
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:06,916
to stop her...

41
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:14,958
Fana. Let's go and
explore together!

42
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,541
We said we would, so let's go.

43
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,833
[NARRATOR] The memories of
her past were restored.

44
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:06,916
Aw, yeah!

45
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,250
[MARS]
Asta.

46
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:13,791
This all happened,
and it's because of you.

47
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:16,125
The battlefield is
a place of power.

48
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:18,791
On it, there is no
room for the weak.

49
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:20,875
That's why... I was born.

50
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:23,375
To destroy those like you.

51
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:26,083
You're in my way. Begone!

52
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,625
Only those who are
strong will survive.

53
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:31,000
The weak deserve death.

54
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:33,583
You're a pathetic,
helpless little child.

55
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:37,500
You never stood a chance
of defeating me!

56
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:41,041
[laughs] Nah, that
was all you Mars!

57
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:42,250
You're tough!

58
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:44,416
I knew you'd be able
to save your friend.

59
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,541
Hold on.

60
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,166
Are the two of you
already acquainted?

61
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:47,916
Sort of.

62
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,125
Oh, wow!

63
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,791
So you made a friend
in the outside world.

64
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,416
That's wonderful to hear!

65
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,333
Well, we're not really--

66
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:56,291
Yup, that's right.
We're buddies!

67
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,125
Even though we did
fight that one time.

68
00:04:58,208 --> 00:04:59,291
[laughs]

69
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:01,416
That hurts.

70
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,958
Ow, my hand!

71
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:04,791
[FANA giggles]

72
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:07,375
I'm glad you've
relaxed a little, too.

73
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:10,208
So what the heck happened
to make you go crazy?

74
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,625
[ASTA yelping]

75
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:15,833
Why do you always fly
by the seat of your pants?

76
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,291
You could've been killed!

77
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:19,041
[FINRAL]
How did you survive this long

78
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:20,416
doing reckless stuff like that?

79
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,208
[VANESSA]
And put some clothes on already!

80
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:23,458
I have to tell you, Mars,

81
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:25,500
you really are an
outstanding pupil.

82
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:28,625
Thank you for
everything, Master.

83
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:30,458
[FANA]
Master Fanzell!

84
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,416
[FANZELL] Your powers are
meant for protecting people

85
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,958
and nothing else.

86
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:38,291
Don't ever forget that, okay?

87
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:39,833
[DIAMOND KNIGHT CHILDREN]
Right!

88
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:46,708
[FANZELL] I'm so happy
both of you are alive.

89
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:54,583
[ASTA]
You barely remember anything?

90
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:56,125
Right.

91
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:59,500
I do recall something
from after training.

92
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:04,541
[MORRIS] Has the girl
really come back to life?

93
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:07,333
Is this because of
that phoenix magic?

94
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:09,375
Or perhaps...

95
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:10,791
I see!

96
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:14,750
Then we should entrust a
magic stone to Fana, as well.

97
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:18,125
[MORRIS]
How disappointing.

98
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:20,125
Her magic power
should be heightened,

99
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:22,791
but it's practically depleted.

100
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:25,166
Down to the last dying embers.

101
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,500
Throw her away.

102
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:29,541
She is of no further
interest to me.

103
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:40,333
How tragic. To think
you were my friend.

104
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:43,250
I suppose this world
never changes.

105
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:47,083
If humans are so determined
to harm each other,

106
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:49,666
then we'll just help them along.

107
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:54,083
However, you're going
to need your body, so...

108
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:56,291
Let's keep you alive.

109
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,750
Everything after
that is a blank.

110
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:05,875
It was like somebody
was possessing me,

111
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:09,875
and they controlled
everything that I did.

112
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:13,541
All I remember is feeling
that person's intense hatred.

113
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:17,166
What about your third eye
and those pointy ears?

114
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,541
I'm sorry, but I
really don't know.

115
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:23,791
All of that time, how could
I have been so oblivious?

116
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:25,125
It's all right.

117
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:27,625
There's nothing that you
need to feel guilty about.

118
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:30,250
It brought us back
together, didn't it?

119
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,458
[MARS] True. And I'm
not letting you go!

120
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:33,458
Oh, my.

121
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:34,625
[gasps]

122
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:36,708
You're right. We'd
better stick together!

123
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:38,083
Uh, yeah.

124
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,708
[VANESSA] Ooh, things are
heating up over there.

125
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:43,166
And look how tense and
awkward the poor guy is!

126
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,583
It's so adorable! [laughs]

127
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,791
A happy reunion of
two childhood friends

128
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,375
torn apart by tragedy.

129
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:51,750
What a wonderful
thing to witness!

130
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:54,750
[ASTA] Whoa, those are
some serious waterworks!

131
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:56,833
I can't tell if
you're happy or sad!

132
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:59,833
I'm jealous, sad, and
angry all put together!

133
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:01,000
What do you mean?

134
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:02,708
Did you never have
any childhood buddies?

135
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:04,333
Oh, let's be honest, Asta.

136
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:06,583
I never had one as cute as
she is and we both know it!

137
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:09,208
Even I have friends
from when I was little.

138
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:11,125
A whole bunch of 'em!

139
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:13,875
If you're saying that
to make me jealous,

140
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:15,000
it's not working!

141
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:18,000
Not sure how I deserved that!

142
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:20,000
You should respect royalty!

143
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,250
I don't get it.

144
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,083
Why did the Eye of
the Midnight Sun

145
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:26,291
come to the Forest of
Witches to start with?

146
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:27,541
What's wrong?

147
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,583
I still feel their thoughts.

148
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:32,083
Whoever was controlling
my mind earlier was saying

149
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:34,958
that they wanted to take
back the magic stone.

150
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:37,041
[VANESSA]
Uh?

151
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:38,916
Magic stone?

152
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,291
[VANESSA] Does that mean one
of them is in the forest?

153
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,875
Then we have to hurry back
to where the Queen is!

154
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:46,166
Hold on. First things first.

155
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,250
Let's make sure everyone's safe.

156
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:51,125
Domina, Mariella,
and all those witches.

157
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:52,416
Ah--

00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:59,833

00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:26,041
[LADROS] You're right,
that was an awful lot

164
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:28,125
of magic you fed me.

165
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:30,791
It took a few good minutes
to absorb all of it.

166
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:32,708
Thanks for the meal.

167
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:35,708
For a second there,
I was sure I was a goner!

168
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,083
It can't be!

169
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:39,083
You were out of power!

170
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:42,250
No, I just fired it all off
and then pulled it back in!

171
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,208
You're pretty good at
magic detection, Teach,

172
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:46,833
but you rely on
that way too much.

173
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:49,458
And while we're on the
subject, I have a question.

174
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:51,375
Why are all you softies
so quick to throw

175
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:54,583
your own lives away to
save somebody else's?

176
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:58,041
No. He'll kill you.

177
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:01,250
That's the smartest thing
you've said all day.

178
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,666
Oh, wonderful. Now
this little reject's

179
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,958
trying to interfere.

180
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:14,000
Step aside, shorty.
This doesn't concern you.

181
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,333
Of course it does!

182
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:18,583
I can't let you hurt him!
He's my friend!

183
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,291
[LADROS]
Why are all you softies so quick

184
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:31,791
to throw your own lives away
to save somebody else's?

185
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:35,125
No. He'll kill you.

186
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:38,416
That's the smartest thing
you've said all day.

187
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:46,875
Oh, wonderful. Now
this little reject's

Step aside, shorty.
This doesn't concern you

190
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:52,416
Of course it does!

191
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,208
I can't let you hurt him!
He's my friend!

192
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:57,625
Asta.

193
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:02,375
Oh, no! Here, I'll heal you!

194
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:04,041
It failed?

195
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:06,083
[FANA] Is there something
wrong with me?

196
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,125
Am I out of magic power?

197
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:10,125
[LADROS laughs]

198
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:11,500
You just stay there.

199
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,541
Leave this jerk to me!

200
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,500
[LADROS]
Whoa! Wait a second, kid.

201
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,083
I think I recognize you!

202
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:18,833
You're that magicless
knight who fights

203
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:21,625
using anti-magic, aren't you?

204
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:23,708
Trust me, I know your pain!

205
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:27,083
I was born without a magic
attribute. Isn't that something?

206
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:28,958
When I was growin' up,
all the other kids

207
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:30,041
used to make fun of me

208
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:31,875
and say that I was
bland and boring!

209
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,833
But hey, at least
I had magic, right?

210
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:35,958
Unlike you!

211
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:38,083
Shut your mouth or
I'll shut it for ya!

212
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:39,625
I feel sorry for you.

213
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,750
Then gimme your magic!

214
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,958
Y'know, I certainly
would if I could!

215
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,833
[ASTA growls]

216
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:47,500
Oh! Fine!

217
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Can you reach it?

218
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:51,375
[ASTA yells]

219
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:54,000
You are the funniest little
fella, you know that?

220
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:57,125
I think the two of us could
make a pretty stellar team.

221
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:58,666
Wanna join forces?

222
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:02,250
I could make you
my right-hand man.

223
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:03,541
I'll put in a good word for you

224
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:05,500
with the Diamond Kingdom
Army and you and I

225
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:07,333
can climb through
the ranks together.

226
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:08,500
What do you say?

227
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:10,458
We've got what it
takes to beat everyone

228
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:13,208
who ever looked down
their noses at us!

229
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:14,375
[LADROS]
Joke's on him.

230
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:16,041
All I'm planning to do
is soak up those

231
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:19,166
anti-magic powers for myself!

232
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,541
Forget it.

233
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:21,375
Ah?

234
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:22,625
No deal!

235
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:25,291
I'm gonna be the Clover
Kingdom's Wizard King!

236
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:30,041
Wizard King, huh? That's cute.

237
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:32,416
Maybe you're not
a good sidekick.

238
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,958
You're too dense!
Million Lasers!

239

[ASTA yells]

240
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:39,541
Sweet little No-Magic Knight,

241
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:42,083
I know a few things
about how you operate.

242
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,541
For example, now that
your Spatial mage

243
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:46,458
is out of commission,
you'll be helpless

244
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:48,791
against long-distance attacks!

245
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:51,625
You're a sitting duck!

246
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:53,250
[yells]

247
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:55,416
And don't bother bouncing
anything back at me,

248
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,083
'cause I can just recycle
it! You can't win!

249
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:01,625
You might as well give up now!

250
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:07,250
[ASTA panting]

251
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,833
You may know some
things about me,

252
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:11,666
but if you think you
can hurt my friends

253
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,375
and get away with it,

254
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:16,250
then you don't know me at all!

255
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:18,000
"Friends," huh?

256
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:21,000
There's no such
thing as friends.

257
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,166
This world has
two types of people.

258
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:26,416
Those who use and
those who get used.

259
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,583
I made it where I am
by using the ones

260
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:30,208
you'd call my "friends."

261
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:32,500
That includes our poor,
defeated Marsie-boy

262
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:34,333
and his little girlfriend.

263
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:37,000
I plan to use those two
to my benefit as well.

264
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,250
They can live out the rest
of their pitiful lives

265
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:42,583
as test subjects in the
Diamond Army's magic labs!

266
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:48,083
[LADROS laughs]

267
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:49,250
[LADROS]
What's wrong?

268
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,833
Still think I won't
get away with it?

269
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:53,083
[ASTA growls]

270
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,875
You're about to become
my stepping stone, too!

271
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:58,125
[laughs]

272
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:03,208
[LADROS]
Oh. This is bad.

273
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:11,250
[LADROS groans]

274
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:16,916
[LADROS] No! My magic power
is dwindling fast!

275
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,458
And it doesn't feel
so great either.

276
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:22,833
[LADROS] It won't budge!
Are you kidding me?

277
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:25,375
Is this really the way
I'm gonna go out?

278
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:27,250
After stockpiling
that much magic,

279
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:30,791
I drop my guard for a second
in all this smoke and that's it?

280
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:33,500
And I just made
Shining General, too!

281
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:35,833
No, no, no, no, no, no!

282
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:40,541
[LADROS] Oh, this can't be
happening! It's not fair!

283
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:43,291
All he had to do was chuck
that big, stupid, heavy sword

284
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:46,500
up there one time and he
knocked me right out of the sky!

285
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:48,583
Man, talk about perfect aim!

286
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:51,625
And now look what
a sorry state I'm in!

287
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:54,416
Damn it all. Time for
a last-ditch effort!

288
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,250
I can't let myself be
defeated by a fluke

289
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:59,791
of an attack like this!
In fact, I won't!

290
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:03,416
Stay back! Don't hurt me!

291
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,208
I didn't make it this far
all on my own either.

292
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:09,000
I was taught how to fight.

293
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,083
How to use my strength.

294
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:13,875
My friends and I honed
our skills together

295
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:17,625
by always having
each other's backs!

296
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,375
You wanna know how I've been
able to respond to his attacks?

297
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,041
It's 'cause I've been pickin'
up on somethin' that

298
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:24,375
the people back in
my country call "ki."

299
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:25,583
"Ki"?

300
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,666
There's a saying where I'm from.

301
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:31,875
Whatever happens, a warrior
never goes back on his word.

302
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:36,125
You did say you were gonna
be the Wizard King, right?

303
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:39,291
This is where you gotta
push past your limits.

304
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:42,041
If you don't, then
your path ends here.

305
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:44,375
Yes, sir!

on this single shot!

with that new move!

is gonna be incredible!

320
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,958
All right!

321
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,875
My special move totally
kicked her butt!

322
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:56,250
You think friends only
exist so you can use them?

323
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:58,541
Well, that's not how
we do things!

324
00:16:58,625 --> 00:16:59,916
Real friends

325
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,916
are always helping
each other get better!

326
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,875
Yeah! I was wrong and I'm sorry!

327
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,208
I promise I'll never
hurt anyone again.

328
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:10,541
Just help me, I'm begging you!

329
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:13,833
Come on. Just take
the sword out, Asta!

330
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:16,458
Hurry, I can't do it by myself!

331
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:19,375
Yeah right!

332
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:20,583
[LADROS groans]

333
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:21,833
[ASTA]
I know how strong you are--

334
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:24,666
no way am I gonna fall for that!

335
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,500
If I do it and you fight
back, I'm dead meat!

336
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:30,208
Heck, if I had missed,
I'd be dead right now!

337
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:32,541
Just how stupid do
you think I am, pal?

338
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:35,291
Ah! Wait, please don't kill me!

339
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:37,458
I won't last much
longer this way!

340
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:41,833
It wasn't a fatal stab!
You're gonna be okay!

341
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:42,583
[LADROS whimpers]

342
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:43,916
[LADROS]
Agh, dammit!

343
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,583
I thought I could
appeal to his emotions,

344
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:47,958
but he's not as stupid
as I expected!

345
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,833
This kid's obviously
learned a thing or two

346
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:52,208
from all the tough
battles he's fought!

347
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:53,875
Looks like the best option

348
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:56,541
is to hit ya real hard
so ya pass out!

349
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:58,000
This is gonna hurt!

350
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,958
[yelps] Please, no!

351
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,666
[LADROS]
I have a little magic left.

352
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,583
If I can hit this and dodge
him, I'll be in the clear!

353
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:12,416
[LADROS] Maybe I can force it
out with Reinforcement Magic!

354
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,208
[screams]

355
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:17,416
[LADROS]
Owie!

356
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,750
[LADROS] I've got enough to
muster two magical bullets.

357
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,208
[gasps]

358
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:25,125
Leave her alone!

359
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:27,125
Hi there. It's Fana, right?

360
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:28,375
Let me go!

361
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,416
I don't know how you got
your pretty little hands

362
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,708
on such a ridiculous
amount of power,

363
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:36,250
but I'm gonna need you to cast
that super-strong spell now.

364
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:39,375
Huh? Super-strong spell?
Wh-What do you mean?

365
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:42,666
Don't play dumb with me.
Hurry up and get to it!

366
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,458
Or he dies!

367
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,166
Oh, no!

368
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:51,000
[LADROS] It'll only take
one more to kill him.

369
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:56,125
[yells] I won't let you!

370
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:58,041
[LADROS]
Bingo!

371
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:02,500
Now it's time to pull out all
the stops for the grand finale!

372
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:07,250
[LADROS yells]

373
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,416
[LADROS]
What outrageous power!

374
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:13,958
My whole body's
bursting at the seams!

375
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:18,250
Ladros.

376
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,583
What happened?

377
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:36,125
Oh, that hits the spot!

378
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:39,458
No doubt about it, that was
the most delicious magic power

379
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:41,791
I've ever had the
pleasure of consuming!

380
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,166
What is this?

381
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,583
Spirits aren't even capable
of generating that much!

382
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:49,458
The fact that he can hold it
at all is downright inhuman!

383
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:51,833
What the hell have you done?

384
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:53,625
That's it!

385
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:57,208
Sorry, it's my turn.

386
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:02,333
[ASTA] I can track his ki,
but he's way too fast to dodge!

387
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:09,666
[laughs] With a spell
like this, I'm unstoppable!

388
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,083
I can't wait to
put all the other

389
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:12,750
Shining Generals to shame!

390
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:14,916
And more than that,
the entire kingdom

391
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,208
will be mine for the taking!

392
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:21,875
I'll make the world pay dearly
for looking down on me!

393
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:23,541
But before I do.

394
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:26,833
Guess I should finish
what I started, huh?

395
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:27,708
[ASTA groans]

396
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,750
You won't sneak up on me again.

397
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:34,166
I'm gonna hit you with a barrage
of long-distance attacks.

398
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:37,791
Soon your body will be
torn to smithereens!

399
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:41,250
Asta, no!

400
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:48,000
My, how imperfect.

401
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:50,375
Since he's able
to wield that sword,

402
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:55,083
I had assumed he must be
a member of that bloodline.

403
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:58,541
Why don't we show them
what you really are?

404
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:01,958
[heartbeats]

405
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:03,750
[LADROS]
Tell me, tough guy.

406
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:05,791
How many more of
these magic blasts

407
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:09,291
do you think you can
suffer before you die?

408
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:14,875
[heartbeats]

409
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:00,125
[FULL CAST]
Clover Clips!

410
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:04,083
[LADROS]
"How's it Taste?"

411
00:23:10,125 --> 00:23:12,000
Oh, that hits the spot!

412
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:15,416
No doubt about it, that was
the most delicious magic power

413
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,791
I've ever had the
pleasure of consuming!

414
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:19,000
Here!

415
00:23:19,083 --> 00:23:21,583
[LADROS]
Mm. That tastes sophisticated!

416
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:23,166
Leave it to royalty!

417
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:24,333
Here!

418
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,875
[LADROS]
Mm! And Your magic's

419
00:23:25,958 --> 00:23:28,375
got a bit of a
mature flavor to it.

420
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:29,541
Take this!

421
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:31,666
Oh, wow. That one
tastes so familiar!

422
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,791
It just gave me a
rush of nostalgia!

423
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:35,041
Really?

424
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:36,625
Yeah, it kinda tastes
like a bunch of prunes!

425
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:38,208
First you said I
look old, and now

426
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:40,666
you're telling me my
magic tastes old, too?

427
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,041
Yup, that's the
gist of it, Teach!

428
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:48,958
[VANESSA] What did the
Queen do to you, Asta?

429
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:51,958
[gasps] Your grimoire's
got an eerie glow!

430
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:54,625
And why do you look like
some kind of evil demon?

431
00:23:54,708 --> 00:23:57,833
<i>Black Clover</i> , Page 63:
"Not in the Slightest."

432
00:23:57,916 --> 00:24:00,583
A shooting star,
black as the night sky.
