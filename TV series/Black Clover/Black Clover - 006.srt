00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:15,708
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:18,666
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:24,375
[NARRATOR] All seemed
lost until a lone mage

4
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:27,041
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,500
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:39,666
as the Wizard King, and
his story became legend.

7
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,541
[NARRATOR] Asta and Yuno
have both beaten the odds

8
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:46,875
and passed the Magic
Knights Entrance Exam.

[GAYAYA]
No way.

00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:02,375
[SHINANA]
All of them?

16
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:04,166
[BUMODA]
Impossible!

17
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:08,333
It would be an honor
to join the Golden Dawn.

No hands.

00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:20,041
[YAMI]
It's no real surprise, is it?

22
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:24,625
What would anyone
ever want with you?

23
00:01:24,708 --> 00:01:26,291
A kid with zero magic.

24
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:30,583
[ASTA] I won't give up! No!
I will become the Wizard King!

25
00:01:34,416 --> 00:01:38,750
[laughs]

26
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:41,500
You know, kid, I like you.

27
00:01:41,583 --> 00:01:44,083
Come join our crew.

28
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:47,083
[NARRATOR] With their acceptance
into Magic Knights squads,

the two young men have
taken the first step

toward becoming the Wizard King.

31
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:55,166
I'm the newest
member of this squad.

Aw! Whoops!

35
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:05,791
This is us.

36
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:08,000
The worst of the worst
Magic Knight squads.

37
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:10,250
Welcome to the Black Bulls.

38
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:50,416
[KLAUS] You must be our
new recruit this year.

Yuno.

41
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:58,708
[KLAUS] Hmph. Well,
my name is Klaus Lunettes.

42
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:00,916
A commoner from a tiny village.

43
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,125
Somebody who is of neither
royal nor noble birth.

44
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:09,125
What was Captain Vangeance
thinking, letting you in?

45
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,208
Don't get cocky just
because all of the captains

46
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:14,541
raised their hands for you.
It means nothing.

47
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:16,291
You'll need more than
that to be accepted

48
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:19,625
as a true knight
of the Golden Dawn.

49
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:22,625
I'm certain I'll prove
myself soon enough.

50
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:25,916
[KLAUS]
Hpmh. Watch that smart mouth.

[ASTA yelps]

56
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,208
[MAGNA]
Okay, now I'm real mad!

57
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:48,250
You ready to take me on?

58
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,833
Nope, not really! But let's go.

59
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,708
[MAGNA]
Die!

[MAGNA]
Take that! And that!

62
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:01,416
[groans] Why's it
so loud in here?

63
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,708
Ugh, I should've skipped
those extra drinks.

64
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:05,375
My head is killing me.

[LUCK giggling]

00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:11,416

[VANESSA] Please, make
it stop. My poor head.

Here we go.

[ASTA]
Man, these guys are scary.

73
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:33,208
Still, I'm one of them now.
I'd better act like it.

74
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:37,125
I'm Asta from Hage Village.

75
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:40,208
I'm a Black Bull now, too.

76
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:43,500
Someday, I'm gonna
become the Wizard King!

77
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,833
[LUCK] That flan you were
saving was super tasty.

[MAGNA] Good, because that's
the last thing you'll ever eat!

[GAUCHE] Come on, give it
a rest, you idiots!

82
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:54,333
You're going to
wake up my sister

83

with all the noise
you're making, damn it!

you freaky sister-lover!

Let's see.

86
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,875
I remember getting into
a drinking contest

87
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:06,500
with some guy, but after that...

calling me that?

So hot.

321
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:41,916
[MAGNA]
Here we go!

322
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,916
Flame Magic...

323
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:53,000
...Exploding Fireball!

324
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:56,083
[ASTA]
Are you serious?!

325
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,791
[ASTA]
Oh, man. I'm dead.

326
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:04,541
[NARRATOR]
Without conscious thought,

327
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:07,291
Asta's brain realized something.

328
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:09,875
Thus far, he'd used
his well-trained body,

329
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:12,666
his kinetic vision,
and his explosive power

330
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,625
to slice through magic
and destroy his foes.

331
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,250
But this time was different.

332
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:20,875
Magna's magic was too quick
for Asta to intercept.

333
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,208
[ASTA]
It's so fast!

334
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:24,041
[NARRATOR]
Even if he did slice through it,

335
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:26,541
the force of the
attack would not die,

336
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:30,250
and Asta would still
absorb the full blow.

337
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:32,250
[ASTA]
I can't block it!

338
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:34,458
[NARRATOR] When he knew
he was out of options,

339
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:37,916
all thought shut down.

340
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,708
However, his body
still refused to give up.

341
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:45,875
[NARRATOR] Asta had spent
years training his body.

342
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:48,416
And when faced with
this final struggle...

343
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:52,666
[yells]

344
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:56,083
[NARRATOR] ...somehow,
it found a way to survive.

345
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:13,458
[LUCK]
Whoa! He did it! He did it!

346
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:14,833
[CHARMY]
Woo-hoo!

347
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:16,875
Wow, did not see that coming.

348
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,250
That's the first time in a while

349
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:20,500
that we haven't had
to rescue the newbie.

350
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,625
[YAMI] He couldn't slice it
with the blade's edge,

351
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:25,625
so he hit it with the flat.

352
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:28,166
Seems that sword can both
cut through magic

353
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:31,791
and reflect it. Interesting.

354
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,125
[ASTA]
I had no idea!

355
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:36,625
I knew I could
slice through magic,

356
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:38,916
but it turns out
I can hit it, too?

357
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,458
This sword is awesome!

358
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:44,250
But, jeez, that was close!
I almost died!

359
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:46,333
What the hell was
he thinking, anyway?

360
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:48,583
Does he wanna kill the new guy?

361
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:51,375
Wait. I didn't kill him, did I?

362
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:56,500
[MAGNA] What the hell did you
just do, you crazy little runt?

363
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:57,875
[screams]

364
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:00,666
[ASTA] He took a direct hit,
and he's still standing?

365
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,791
[MAGNA] I was able to dispel
it in time, so I'm all right,

366
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,291
but that doesn't change the fact

367
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:08,208
that I was nearly offed
by my own magic.

368
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:10,875
[ASTA gasping]

369
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:12,750
Why, you little...!

00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:15,916
[growling, yelling]

371
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,333
[ASTA] Scary, scary, scary,
scary, scary, scary,

372
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,416

373
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,500
You're really good, wow!

374
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:26,375
[MAGNA laughing]

375
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:28,500
Here I thought you were
just gonna block my magic,

376
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:30,083
and you fired it back at me?!

377
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:33,125
Y'know, I think I kinda
like you, little Rasta.

378
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:34,708
It's, um, Asta.

379
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:37,750
[MAGNA] Hey, sorry about callin'
you a magic-poor hick earlier.

380
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:40,750
H-Hell, to be honest,
I'm from the sticks myself.

381
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:43,166

just up from Hage.

382
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,000
[ASTA]
No way! Really?

383
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:47,041
Rayaka is way out in
the middle of nowhere.

384
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,666
[MAGNA] Yeah, sure.

385
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,291
[MAGNA laughs]

386
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:54,541
Ha, ha! Oh, and, uh,
just so you know,

387
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,333
it's not that I have
low magic power.

388
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:57,791
I actually have none at all.

389
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:58,750
What was that?

390
00:18:58,833 --> 00:18:59,583
[squeaks]

391
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:02,125
You've got no magic power?

392
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:05,416
And you were still able
to turn my magic against me?

393
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,166
Uh, yeah. I guess so.

394
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,458
Well, that's even
more amazing, then.

395
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:14,166
You're not just some runt--
you're a real man.

Sure, okay.

fair and square, Asta.

And, now, the finishing touch.

Hey! It looks pretty
good on you. Right, Yami?
