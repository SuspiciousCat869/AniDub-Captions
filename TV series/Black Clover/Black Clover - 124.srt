00:00:23,638 --> 00:00:25,682
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:25,765 --> 00:00:30,228
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:30,311 --> 00:00:32,480
All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:32,564 --> 00:00:36,234
stepped forward
and took up the fight.

5
00:00:36,317 --> 00:00:40,905
The hero's name was
Lumiere Silvamillion Clover.

6
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:45,493
[NARRATOR] He was later hailed
as the First Wizard King,

7
00:00:45,577 --> 00:00:48,329
and his story became legend.

8
00:00:54,544 --> 00:00:57,756
[SECRÉ] The devil was
sealed for 500 years,

9
00:00:57,839 --> 00:01:01,426
but the day would soon come
when the seal would break.

10
00:01:01,509 --> 00:01:04,012
Against all reason
in this world,

11
00:01:04,095 --> 00:01:06,264
I was transformed into a bird,

12
00:01:06,348 --> 00:01:09,434
and I continued to guard
Licht's grimoire.

13
00:01:11,311 --> 00:01:15,315
[SECRÉ] In the present day, this
place is called Hage Village.

14
00:01:15,398 --> 00:01:18,068
It's situated far away
from the royal capital

15
00:01:18,151 --> 00:01:22,530
of the Clover Kingdom.
A hamlet in the Forsaken Realm.

16
00:01:36,378 --> 00:01:40,548
[YUNO]
Asta! Hang in there.

17
00:01:40,632 --> 00:01:45,679
I'm sorry. It's all
my fault. I'm so sorry.

18
00:01:45,762 --> 00:01:49,307
[ASTA] This? Please.
Don't worry about it.

19
00:01:49,391 --> 00:01:52,519
This is nothin'. After all,

20
00:01:52,602 --> 00:01:55,438
I'm gonna be the
Wizard King, right?

21
00:01:55,522 --> 00:01:57,691
I'm gonna be the Wizard King.

22
00:01:57,774 --> 00:02:01,027
I'll keep you and
everybody else safe.

23
00:02:01,111 --> 00:02:04,489
No more worrying
about food or money.

24
00:02:04,572 --> 00:02:06,241
You'll have everything
you ever wanted.

25
00:02:06,324 --> 00:02:07,617
[YUNO gasps]

26
00:02:07,701 --> 00:02:11,037
[ASTA] I'll prove it.
I'll show them all.

27
00:02:11,121 --> 00:02:12,831
Show them? Prove what?

28
00:02:12,914 --> 00:02:15,667
That even if you're poor...

29
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,753
...a commoner and an orphan...

30
00:02:18,837 --> 00:02:21,715
...you can still become
the Wizard King.

31
00:02:21,798 --> 00:02:23,842
You really think so?

32
00:02:23,925 --> 00:02:25,385
[ASTA]
Yeah!

33
00:02:25,468 --> 00:02:28,471
Commoners? Orphans?

34
00:02:28,555 --> 00:02:31,057
Anybody can do it.

35
00:02:31,141 --> 00:02:33,810
As long as they're
willing to work hard.

36
00:02:33,893 --> 00:02:35,770
[YUNO]
Anybody?

37
00:02:35,854 --> 00:02:39,149
Even me, and even you.

38
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,026
[gasps]

39
00:02:45,321 --> 00:02:49,325
I... I'm never going
to cry again.

40
00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:52,162
I've decided.

41
00:02:52,245 --> 00:02:53,872
Whatddya mean?

42
00:02:53,955 --> 00:02:55,415
I'll do it, too.

43
00:02:55,498 --> 00:02:58,209
I'm going to become
the Wizard King.

44
00:02:58,293 --> 00:02:59,669
I'll work hard and get strong

45
00:02:59,753 --> 00:03:02,589
so I can protect you
and everybody else.

46
00:03:02,672 --> 00:03:07,052
I'll do whatever it takes,
and I'll never give up!

47
00:04:44,524 --> 00:04:46,234
[PATRY gasps]

48
00:04:46,317 --> 00:04:48,069
[PATRY]
What is this place?

49
00:04:48,153 --> 00:04:50,655
What happened to me?

50
00:04:50,739 --> 00:04:53,575
I thought... I was dead.

51
00:04:55,493 --> 00:04:59,372
[gasps] I look like Licht!

52
00:04:59,456 --> 00:05:00,832
[PATRY]
What is this?

53
00:05:00,915 --> 00:05:03,084
Have I become him somehow?

54
00:05:03,168 --> 00:05:08,048
Did my spirit implant
itself in his body?

55
00:05:08,131 --> 00:05:09,674
That's not it.

56
00:05:09,758 --> 00:05:14,054
Judging by how this mana feels,
the body I'm in is human!

57
00:05:14,137 --> 00:05:17,057
A human that looks like Licht.

58
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:20,602
I see. So I really did die.

59
00:05:20,685 --> 00:05:22,520
Whatever Licht unleashed
when our magic

60
00:05:22,604 --> 00:05:24,689
was sealed away,
it must have been

61
00:05:24,773 --> 00:05:26,941
some kind of forbidden spell,

62
00:05:27,025 --> 00:05:29,819
and something
extremely powerful, too!

63
00:05:29,903 --> 00:05:32,238
Like Reincarnation Magic!

64
00:05:33,865 --> 00:05:35,200
This light.

65
00:05:37,077 --> 00:05:40,413
[PATRY] I can sense them,
every single one!

66
00:05:40,497 --> 00:05:42,499
I can feel Rhya's soul,
and the souls

67
00:05:42,582 --> 00:05:45,168
of all the other elves
in this village!

68
00:05:45,251 --> 00:05:46,419
Licht must have done this

69
00:05:46,503 --> 00:05:49,089
in the final few
seconds of his life!

70
00:05:49,172 --> 00:05:51,716
And all for the sake
of our people.

71
00:05:58,056 --> 00:06:02,227
[PATRY] I have been chosen.
I'll become Licht!

72
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,396
No matter what it takes.

73
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:11,820
[PATRY] I'll revive all the
elves. As for the humans...

74
00:06:11,903 --> 00:06:13,863
For going back on their word,

75
00:06:13,947 --> 00:06:18,326
for killing the people
I loved, they must pay!

76
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:21,496
I swear, they will
all be annihilated!

77
00:06:27,002 --> 00:06:28,545
[PATRY]
So, these three are the souls

78
00:06:28,628 --> 00:06:31,756
I was able to restore
at this juncture.

79
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,842
It's as if they never died.

80
00:06:33,925 --> 00:06:37,303
But I'll need greater power
to bring back the rest.

81
00:06:37,387 --> 00:06:40,849
And that means supplying
even more sacrifices.

82
00:06:40,932 --> 00:06:43,768
To that end, we will
gather the magic stones

83
00:06:43,852 --> 00:06:45,520
that were once kept
within our village

84
00:06:45,603 --> 00:06:48,481
but have since been
scattered far and wide.

85
00:06:48,565 --> 00:06:51,067
And we'll use humans to do it.

86
00:06:51,151 --> 00:06:52,527
Smart, don't you think?

87
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:53,361
Oh, yeah.

88
00:06:53,445 --> 00:06:54,738
Agreed. Let's begin.

89
00:06:54,821 --> 00:06:57,240
We'll get back at
those hateful scum.

90
00:06:57,323 --> 00:07:00,577
I'll make sure they
suffer endless despair!

91
00:07:02,704 --> 00:07:04,789
[PATRY]
Indeed. The great rebirth

92
00:07:04,873 --> 00:07:07,042
will start with the humans.

93
00:07:12,797 --> 00:07:17,052
[SECRÉ] Resurrecting the elves.
Getting revenge on humankind.

94
00:07:17,135 --> 00:07:19,512
It was all a misunderstanding.

95
00:07:19,596 --> 00:07:22,932
Sadly, they had no
way of knowing that.

96
00:07:25,018 --> 00:07:27,228
[SECRÉ] Everything that
happened was orchestrated

97
00:07:27,312 --> 00:07:30,023
by a deceitful devil.

98
00:07:30,106 --> 00:07:32,984
Not only the capital,
but the entire kingdom,

99
00:07:33,068 --> 00:07:37,364
was about to be
overrun by darkness.

100
00:07:37,447 --> 00:07:42,660
However, at that same time,
I saw a glimmer of hope.

101
00:07:50,627 --> 00:07:53,922
[ASTA]
Is that... a grimoire?

102
00:07:56,883 --> 00:07:59,386
[SECRÉ]
My prince.

103
00:07:59,469 --> 00:08:01,763
The time has come.

104
00:08:06,935 --> 00:08:10,063
[SECRÉ] The leaves of the clover
represent three things.

105
00:08:10,146 --> 00:08:13,441
One is integrity, one is hope,

106
00:08:13,525 --> 00:08:16,111
and the third one
stands for love.

107
00:08:16,194 --> 00:08:19,698
Within the fourth leaf
dwells good luck.

108
00:08:19,781 --> 00:08:22,951
And in the fifth
lives the devil.

109
00:08:26,454 --> 00:08:28,832
[SECRÉ] But, the devil inside
the grimoire happened

110
00:08:28,915 --> 00:08:32,168
to be different from the one
who had attacked the elves.

111
00:08:32,252 --> 00:08:35,380
This particular being would
later be of aid to Asta,

112
00:08:35,463 --> 00:08:38,675
the boy with no magic.

113
00:08:38,758 --> 00:08:41,636
As for Patry's group,
they named themselves

114
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,472
"The Eye of the Midnight Sun"
and searched for

115
00:08:44,556 --> 00:08:48,560
the magic stones. By collecting
all of these stones,

116
00:08:48,643 --> 00:08:51,521
they would be able to
resurrect the other elves.

117
00:08:51,604 --> 00:08:53,481
Kill them.

118
00:08:53,565 --> 00:08:55,608

They ransacked a village.

No! Fuegoleon!

120

Then the Underwater Temple.

122
00:09:04,993 --> 00:09:09,831
Until finally, every

[RHYA] By infusing

we'll open the door

and release the seal
on the underworld!

[MIMOSA]
I don't understand this at all!

150
00:11:02,152 --> 00:11:04,612
[BAVAL] This is a magic space
that serves as a border

151
00:11:04,696 --> 00:11:06,072
between this world and the next,

152
00:11:06,156 --> 00:11:07,949
which the elves
entrusted to the humans

153
00:11:08,033 --> 00:11:09,534
through an ancient pact.

154
00:11:09,617 --> 00:11:12,120
It's called the Shadow Palace.

155
00:11:12,203 --> 00:11:14,789
[SECRÉ] Should they have
succeeded in placing the final

156
00:11:14,873 --> 00:11:18,585
magic stone into the monument,
the reincarnation spell

157
00:11:18,668 --> 00:11:21,129
would've become permanent,
and the souls

of the human hosts
would be lost forever.

So, Asta and the others

for the final battle.
But something awaited them.

What is this?
A pitch-black magic?

[KOTODAMA DEVIL laughs]

169
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,251
[KOTODAMA DEVIL]
Though it's still incomplete,

170
00:12:00,335 --> 00:12:03,463
it's been centuries since
I've been in my own body!

171
00:12:03,546 --> 00:12:06,675
And it's such
a wonderful feeling.

172
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:10,136
[KOTODAMA DEVIL]
You've used your

173
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:14,474
four-leaf grimoire well,
elf. I commend you.

174
00:12:14,557 --> 00:12:18,144
I praise you from the
bottom of my black heart,

175
00:12:18,228 --> 00:12:20,522
for all that you've
done up to this moment,

176
00:12:20,605 --> 00:12:22,273
and the results you've shown me.

177
00:12:22,357 --> 00:12:23,400
And now...

178
00:12:23,483 --> 00:12:25,694
You shall taste the
depths of despair,

179
00:12:25,777 --> 00:12:28,655
just as another did
all those centuries ago!

[PATRY] Another? But, who?
What is going on here?

That day, the one
who tricked the humans

182
00:12:37,288 --> 00:12:40,375
into betraying the elves
was none other than...

183
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:43,253
Why, me, of course!

184
00:12:43,336 --> 00:12:45,505
And, then you lot
made it even easier,

185
00:12:45,588 --> 00:12:48,466
letting me trick you
in the most amusing way!

186
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,802
The revenge went
exactly as planned.

187
00:12:50,885 --> 00:12:54,681
[KOTODAMA DEVIL laughs]

188
00:12:54,764 --> 00:12:56,182
I might have known.

189
00:12:56,266 --> 00:12:58,560
You're nothing but
a bunch of fools!

190
00:12:58,643 --> 00:13:01,354
Five centuries ago,
they got in my way.

191
00:13:01,438 --> 00:13:04,774
And, though I came close,
my incarnation failed.

192
00:13:04,858 --> 00:13:06,317
Rather than admit defeat,

193
00:13:06,401 --> 00:13:10,488
I selected you to be
my next unwitting pawn.

194
00:13:10,572 --> 00:13:14,200
A new sacrifice,
loved by mana, still young,

195
00:13:14,284 --> 00:13:16,327
and oh-so-easily swayed.

196
00:13:16,411 --> 00:13:20,665
Tragedy, a sense of purpose,
a mission to fulfill.

197
00:13:20,749 --> 00:13:23,168
That's all it took to turn
you to forbidden magic

198
00:13:23,251 --> 00:13:26,546
that would reincarnate the
elves' souls in human form.

199
00:13:26,629 --> 00:13:29,090
No, you have it wrong. Not me.

200
00:13:29,174 --> 00:13:32,510
Licht was the one who
reincarnated us in human bodies.

201
00:13:32,594 --> 00:13:34,971
It's true, he delved
into forbidden magic,

202
00:13:35,055 --> 00:13:38,266
but he did it for us.
He gave us a chance!

203
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,769
You're incorrect. Truth is,

204
00:13:40,852 --> 00:13:43,271
he had nothing to do
with your reincarnation.

205
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:44,689
All me, I'm afraid.

206

[PATRY gasps]

207
00:13:46,983 --> 00:13:50,153
[KOTODAMA DEVIL] You don't
understand your leader's wishes.

208
00:13:50,236 --> 00:13:53,281
He doesn't want to
exterminate humanity.

209
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:56,409
The restoration of the elves,
the revenge you so longed for:

210
00:13:56,493 --> 00:13:58,411
false goals, all of them.

211
00:13:58,495 --> 00:13:59,996
You merely followed the path

212
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:04,209
that I laid for you, and led
the other fools along the way.

213
00:14:04,292 --> 00:14:06,878
You did a truly splendid job.

214
00:14:06,961 --> 00:14:09,964
I couldn't have asked
for a more useful tool.

215
00:14:10,048 --> 00:14:12,092
And, in the end,
it brought about a future

216
00:14:12,175 --> 00:14:15,512
Licht would never want,
and my incarnation,

217
00:14:15,595 --> 00:14:18,431
allowing my soul to return
to my body, at last.

It's not true. He's lying.

Well, you were chosen,
that's true.

220
00:14:26,314 --> 00:14:28,483
But not by the four-leaf clover.

By me, my little puppet!

Ah! It's so amusing!

[KOTODAMA DEVIL] When the owner
of a four-leaf grimoire

229
00:14:57,012 --> 00:15:00,598
is engulfed in deep despair,
a miracle happens:

230
00:15:00,682 --> 00:15:04,269
a five-leaf grimoire is born
out of the darkness within!

231
00:15:04,352 --> 00:15:05,812
At last.

232
00:15:05,895 --> 00:15:09,274
I enjoy both my precious body
and my pitch-black grimoire.

Now I can rule this world,

of my true form and full power!

[SECRÉ] However, we refused
to let that devil win.

to prevent that from happening.

Now that your seal
has finally been broken,

will be released, as well.

318
00:20:07,197 --> 00:20:10,283
Farewell, you disgrace.

319
00:20:18,792 --> 00:20:21,586
We... won.

320
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:23,546
I'm grateful.

[panting]

323
00:20:36,685 --> 00:20:38,436
[SECRÉ]
We prevailed.

[gasps]

326
00:20:42,732 --> 00:20:44,484
The time has come.

327
00:20:44,567 --> 00:20:45,819
I don't have enough magic

328
00:20:45,902 --> 00:20:48,196
to hold this body
together anymore.

329
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:49,864
My prince.

330
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:52,951
[LUMIERE]
Secré--or, Nero, I suppose--

331
00:20:53,034 --> 00:20:55,495
will you watch their
futures play out,

332
00:20:55,578 --> 00:20:58,790
watch them make the
world better, for my sake?

333
00:20:58,873 --> 00:21:00,500
I've always been...

334
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,419
Well, um. I mean...

335
00:21:02,502 --> 00:21:06,089
Anyway. Let me go
with you! Please, sir!

336
00:21:06,172 --> 00:21:08,758
I gave everything 500 years ago.

337
00:21:08,842 --> 00:21:10,844
I should have died that day.

338
00:21:10,927 --> 00:21:14,764
But then, you helped
me protect the future.

339
00:21:14,848 --> 00:21:16,891
Let me go.

340
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:20,228
Like I said, I can't let you
seal off your potential.

341
00:21:21,855 --> 00:21:24,357
[LUMIERE] I think the path
ahead is a bright one.

342
00:21:24,441 --> 00:21:26,693
Both for the Magic Knights
and for the kingdom

343
00:21:26,776 --> 00:21:28,445
they'll fight to defend.

344
00:21:34,743 --> 00:21:38,872
So do I, really!
Serving you for so long.

345
00:21:38,955 --> 00:21:41,124
I-It was an honor!

346
00:21:41,207 --> 00:21:43,543
I was honored to have you.

347
00:21:43,626 --> 00:21:46,880
Secré. Thank you for everything.

348
00:21:46,963 --> 00:21:50,008
You did well. Goodbye.

349
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,068
[SECRÉ]
My prince.

350
00:22:08,151 --> 00:22:10,236
I'm sure there will be
many more challenges

351
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,155
for us to overcome.

352
00:22:12,238 --> 00:22:14,866
But I know everything
will be all right.

353
00:22:14,949 --> 00:22:18,661
Because, from now on,

354
00:22:18,745 --> 00:22:20,580
I won't be alone.

355
00:23:56,801 --> 00:23:57,844
[SECRÉ]
The Black Bulls return

356
00:23:57,927 --> 00:23:59,804
to where their
hideout once stood.

357
00:23:59,888 --> 00:24:01,598
As they attempt to rebuild it,

358
00:24:01,681 --> 00:24:04,017
they all become
drained and collapse.

359
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:07,020
What's wrong with Asta
and his friends?
