1
00:00:22,512 --> 00:00:24,472
[NARRATOR]
The Clover Kingdom.

2
00:00:24,556 --> 00:00:26,975
In this place where
magic is everything,

3
00:00:27,058 --> 00:00:30,270
there lives one boy
who was born without it.

4
00:00:30,353 --> 00:00:33,273
His name is Asta.

5
00:00:33,356 --> 00:00:34,816
His strength and determination

6
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:36,818
helped him become
a Magic Knight.

7
00:00:36,901 --> 00:00:39,362
And despite the many
challenges he faces,

8
00:00:39,446 --> 00:00:43,324
he aims for the top
and refuses to give up!

9
00:00:43,408 --> 00:00:44,951
Rich or poor,

10
00:00:45,035 --> 00:00:46,995
royalty or commoner,

11
00:00:47,078 --> 00:00:49,789
Asta believes anyone can shine.

12
00:00:49,873 --> 00:00:52,709
His mission is to prove
that to the whole world,

13
00:00:52,792 --> 00:00:55,628
and to become the
next Wizard King!

14
00:01:03,845 --> 00:01:05,555
It's finally time
for us to go and train

15
00:01:05,638 --> 00:01:07,140
in the Heart Kingdom!

16
00:01:09,851 --> 00:01:12,312
[FINRAL] I swore I'd become
worthy of Lady Finnes's love

17
00:01:12,395 --> 00:01:15,106
and earn my place as the
head of the House of Vaude.

18
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:17,776
If I fail, it'll all be a lie!

19
00:01:17,859 --> 00:01:19,277
The Spirit Guardians
won't break,

20
00:01:19,361 --> 00:01:21,154
even if I give it my all, right?

21
00:01:21,237 --> 00:01:22,530
This'll be so much fun!

22
00:01:22,614 --> 00:01:25,492
Yup! I'm gonna get
seriously strong out there!

23
00:01:25,575 --> 00:01:26,951
[LUCK]
Get as tough as you want.

24
00:01:27,035 --> 00:01:29,245
I'll still be way
ahead of you, Magna!

25
00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:31,247
[MAGNA]
You wanna bet?

26
00:01:31,331 --> 00:01:34,834
[NOELLE] I have to take out
Megicula and avenge my mother.

27
00:01:34,918 --> 00:01:37,671
But first, I need to
build up my skills!

28
00:03:12,223 --> 00:03:14,768
[ASTA]
Awesome, everybody's here!

29
00:03:14,851 --> 00:03:16,269
[MIMOSA]
Hi, Asta!

30
00:03:16,353 --> 00:03:19,272
Well, it's about time
that you showed up, rival!

31
00:03:19,356 --> 00:03:21,066
[CHARLOTTE]
Training in another land.

32
00:03:21,149 --> 00:03:23,193
I wish Yami were here.

33
00:03:23,276 --> 00:03:24,652
[MIMOSA]
By the way, Asta.

34
00:03:24,736 --> 00:03:26,946
Yuno wanted me to
give you a message.

35
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,031
What is it?

36
00:03:28,114 --> 00:03:29,574
All he said was,

37
00:03:29,657 --> 00:03:32,035
"I'll get stronger
with my squad." Weird.

38
00:03:32,118 --> 00:03:33,995
Not sure why he didn't
wanna come with us;

39
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:36,039
he obviously would've
learned a lot.

40
00:03:36,122 --> 00:03:38,750
Nah, Yuno's gonna get better
no matter where he trains.

41
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:41,044
I won't let him outdo me though!

42
00:03:41,127 --> 00:03:43,213
I see that you've all arrived.

43
00:03:43,296 --> 00:03:45,799
We all appreciate
the invitation, sir.

44
00:03:45,882 --> 00:03:47,801
Come with me.
The queen is waiting.

45
00:03:49,052 --> 00:03:50,720
[LOROPECHIKA]
I see a few new faces

46
00:03:50,804 --> 00:03:53,014
that I haven't had the
pleasure of meeting.

47
00:03:53,098 --> 00:03:55,558
Welcome to the Heart Kingdom.

48
00:03:55,642 --> 00:03:57,143
Under normal circumstances,

49
00:03:57,227 --> 00:04:00,063
I would've ordered a magnificent
feast to celebrate your visit,

50
00:04:00,146 --> 00:04:02,982
but unfortunately, it wasn't
possible at this time.

51
00:04:03,066 --> 00:04:05,694
It pains me that we
cannot offer you more,

52
00:04:05,777 --> 00:04:08,738
but please accept our greetings.

53
00:04:08,822 --> 00:04:10,240
Is something wrong?

54
00:04:10,323 --> 00:04:11,199
I'm sorry.

55
00:04:11,282 --> 00:04:12,617
I know it's rude to interrupt,

56
00:04:12,701 --> 00:04:16,329
but that person
resting in your lap...

57
00:04:16,413 --> 00:04:18,498
Why, it's Charmy, obviously.

58
00:04:18,581 --> 00:04:20,667
[NOELLE]
No, trust me, we know who it is,

59
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,752
but what the heck
is she doing here?

60
00:04:22,836 --> 00:04:25,255
[CHARMY] Wherever snacks be,
you'll find me!

61
00:04:25,338 --> 00:04:26,756
[MAGNA]
Sounds about right.

62
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,384
Must the Black Bulls always
be so unprofessional?

63
00:04:29,467 --> 00:04:31,219
Maybe it's not such
a big deal, though.

64
00:04:31,302 --> 00:04:33,763
Queen Loropechika seems
to be fine with it.

65
00:04:33,847 --> 00:04:35,557
Well, if it's okay
with the queen,

66
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,100
then it's okay with me.

67
00:04:37,183 --> 00:04:40,395
She seems to be pretty relaxed
for a monarch, doesn't she?

68
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:43,189
I don't know if "relaxed"
is really the word I would use.

69
00:04:43,273 --> 00:04:45,775
Brave Magic Knights
of the Clover Kingdom,

70
00:04:45,859 --> 00:04:47,360
we're honored.

71
00:04:47,444 --> 00:04:49,779
[CHARLOTTE] It's a privilege
to be in your care.

72
00:04:49,863 --> 00:04:51,656
[LEOPOLD]
Yeah, thanks for havin' us!

73
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:56,036
Now then, about your training.
Gaja, would you please explain?

74
00:04:56,119 --> 00:04:58,747
The first thing you all
need to know, is that Spade

75
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:01,666
has already captured most of the
Diamond Kingdom's bases,

76
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:05,086
and that their invasion is
at a standstill for right now.

77
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,547
In other words, it won't
be long before they decide

78
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:11,217
to turn their focus on us
or the Clover Kingdom.

79
00:05:11,301 --> 00:05:14,179
To prepare for that, we will
be subjecting each of you

80
00:05:14,262 --> 00:05:17,515
to rigorous training in order
to accelerate your development.

81
00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:19,142
Sounds good to me!

82
00:05:19,225 --> 00:05:21,936
That's not a problem.
As you've explained,

83
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,647
it is imperative that
we improve quickly.

84
00:05:24,731 --> 00:05:27,192
[GAJA] Then allow me to
introduce the Spirit Guardians

85
00:05:27,275 --> 00:05:28,902
who'll be teaching you.

86
00:05:31,571 --> 00:05:33,531
[GAJA]
Guardian of Earth, Sarado.

87
00:05:33,615 --> 00:05:35,325
It's nice to meet you!

88
00:05:35,408 --> 00:05:37,660
[GAJA]
Guardian of Plants, Potrof.

89
00:05:37,744 --> 00:05:39,496
Let's learn together!

90
00:05:39,579 --> 00:05:41,539
[GAJA]
Guardian of Fire, Floga.

91
00:05:41,623 --> 00:05:43,333
Work up a sweat!

92
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:46,920
[GAJA]
Guardian of Wind, Smurik.

93
00:05:47,003 --> 00:05:49,172
They seem like a pretty
serious crowd, huh?

94
00:05:49,255 --> 00:05:51,049
Oh, man, I can't decide
which one of 'em

95
00:05:51,132 --> 00:05:52,509
I wanna spar with most!

96
00:05:52,592 --> 00:05:55,053
Captain Charlotte
and Lady Mimosa.

97
00:05:55,136 --> 00:05:57,764
I would like you both to begin
your training with Sarado.

98
00:05:57,847 --> 00:05:58,890
Understood, sir.

99
00:05:58,973 --> 00:06:00,100
We are ready.

100
00:06:00,183 --> 00:06:02,227
Great, I'm looking
forward to it!

101
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,938
[GAJA] Finral, you'll be
learning from Smurik first.

102
00:06:05,021 --> 00:06:06,022
Yes, sir!

103
00:06:07,023 --> 00:06:09,693
[GAJA] Captain Rill, I'd like
you to start with Potrof.

104
00:06:09,776 --> 00:06:11,069
All right, let's get to it!

105
00:06:11,152 --> 00:06:12,946
I'll see you in
the forest then!

106
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:15,448
We'll be sticking to attributes
for the rest of you.

107
00:06:15,532 --> 00:06:17,492
The fire mages
will work with Floga.

108
00:06:17,575 --> 00:06:19,953
Don't go easy on me,
you got that?

109
00:06:21,454 --> 00:06:23,790
It seems you're both
taking this seriously!

110
00:06:23,873 --> 00:06:26,001
I can't wait to meet
the two of you!

111
00:06:26,084 --> 00:06:28,336
And you'll begin
training with me, Luck.

112
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,963
As long as you
put up a good fight,

113
00:06:30,046 --> 00:06:31,798
I don't care who I train with.

114
00:06:31,881 --> 00:06:33,341
Hang on!

115
00:06:33,425 --> 00:06:35,885
Don't you think you might be
forgetting about somebody here?

116
00:06:35,969 --> 00:06:38,346
[GAJA] I'm sorry, but you
don't possess any mana.

117
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,098
Spirit Guardians are gifted,

118
00:06:40,181 --> 00:06:42,642
but we can't create
power out of nothing.

119
00:06:42,726 --> 00:06:43,852
[ASTA]
Huh?

120
00:06:43,935 --> 00:06:46,396
Well, then what was
the point of me coming?

121
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,773
[GAJA] You're one of
the arcane-stage mages,

122
00:06:48,857 --> 00:06:51,651
which means you'll give us
an advantage against the devil.

123
00:06:51,735 --> 00:06:53,528
I would like you to
face me in a battle,

124
00:06:53,611 --> 00:06:55,572
so that I can get a
sense of your strength.

125
00:06:55,655 --> 00:06:58,533
After that, we will decide
how best to proceed.

126
00:06:58,616 --> 00:07:00,535
All right, looking
forward to it.

127
00:07:00,618 --> 00:07:03,413
[GAJA] As for the other
arcane-stage fighter...

128
00:07:03,496 --> 00:07:06,791
I will see to Nero's
training myself.

129
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:09,294
She'll be training
directly with the queen?

130
00:07:09,377 --> 00:07:11,755
I'm very excited
to work with you, Nero.

131
00:07:11,838 --> 00:07:13,840
Undine and I will
also be overseeing

132
00:07:13,923 --> 00:07:15,717
Noelle's training regimen.

133
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,302
Do your best!

134
00:07:17,385 --> 00:07:19,387
Right. I'm ready.

135
00:07:19,471 --> 00:07:22,223
[GAJA] That should cover
all of our assignments.

136
00:07:22,307 --> 00:07:23,683
[MAGNA]
Wait a second!

137
00:07:23,767 --> 00:07:26,061
[ASTA]
What's the matter, Magna?

138
00:07:26,144 --> 00:07:27,145
Luck here.

139
00:07:27,228 --> 00:07:29,481
We're always competing
with each other.

140
00:07:29,564 --> 00:07:34,069
Any way I can train under you,
too, so we can keep that going?

141
00:07:34,152 --> 00:07:35,695
Fine by me.

142
00:07:35,779 --> 00:07:36,571
Awesome!

143
00:07:36,654 --> 00:07:38,490
Well, I don't really mind,

144
00:07:38,573 --> 00:07:40,200
but are you sure
that you can hack it?

145
00:07:40,283 --> 00:07:41,743
Of course I can!

146
00:07:41,826 --> 00:07:44,412
[GAJA] I should mention: none
of you are permanently bound

147
00:07:44,496 --> 00:07:46,623
by the assignments
I've chosen for you.

148
00:07:46,706 --> 00:07:48,375
Once your mana grows
a bit, you'll move on

149
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:50,627
to a different Spirit
Guardian next to see

150
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:52,879
what new insights
they have to offer.

151
00:07:52,962 --> 00:07:55,715
That way, you can
learn even more.

152
00:07:55,799 --> 00:07:58,843
Magic Knights, your
training will begin now.

153
00:07:58,927 --> 00:08:00,720
Please don't let us down!

154
00:08:00,804 --> 00:08:02,013
[MAGIC KNIGHTS]
Right!

155
00:08:10,563 --> 00:08:15,652
[ASTA] Magna uses Flame Magic
and Luck uses lightning spells.

156
00:08:15,735 --> 00:08:17,612
And both of those
are natural things,

157
00:08:17,696 --> 00:08:18,863
which is how you guys
like to fight

158
00:08:18,947 --> 00:08:20,782
here in the
Heart Kingdom, right?

159
00:08:20,865 --> 00:08:23,535
Which means these two should
be perfect, shouldn't they?

160
00:08:23,618 --> 00:08:25,995
On a basic level, I suppose.

161
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:28,623
First, I'll show you how
you can use natural mana

162
00:08:28,707 --> 00:08:30,750
to create mana words.

163
00:08:33,086 --> 00:08:35,255
--Oh, wow!
--[MAGNA] What the hell is that?

164
00:08:35,338 --> 00:08:38,633
[GAJA] It's a necessary
skill for combat here.

165
00:08:38,717 --> 00:08:40,927
When you build spells
out of mana words,

166
00:08:41,011 --> 00:08:42,929
it allows you to add
some simple commands

167
00:08:43,013 --> 00:08:45,640
into your magic techniques.
For example...

168
00:08:45,724 --> 00:08:47,183
Uh?

169
00:08:47,267 --> 00:08:49,602
[GAJA]
Dodge this attack.

170
00:08:49,686 --> 00:08:50,895

[ASTA gasps]

00:08:54,065 --> 00:08:55,817
[ASTA groans]

173
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:59,112
Mana words will give the spell
a more complex directive,

174
00:08:59,195 --> 00:09:01,614
such as "become larger"
or "pursue him."

175
00:09:01,698 --> 00:09:03,241
That's nuts!

176
00:09:03,324 --> 00:09:04,367
Cool.

177
00:09:04,451 --> 00:09:06,786
Yeah, I wanna learn that!

178
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:09,372
[SARADO]
Plants grow from the earth.

179
00:09:09,456 --> 00:09:12,876
To strengthen plant-based magic,
you begin with the soil.

180
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,002
When you put it that way,

181
00:09:14,085 --> 00:09:16,004
I think I get
what you're saying.

182
00:09:16,087 --> 00:09:18,590
You're saying the first step
is understanding the earth.

183
00:09:18,673 --> 00:09:21,968
It's probably easier to explain
if I give you a demonstration.

184
00:09:29,851 --> 00:09:31,186
[MIMOSA, CHARLOTTE gasp]

185
00:09:37,734 --> 00:09:41,154
So this is what mages are
capable of in the Heart Kingdom.

186
00:09:41,237 --> 00:09:42,947
Our magic attributes
may be different,

187
00:09:43,031 --> 00:09:45,992
but we all need to be in tune
with nature to use our spells.

188
00:09:46,076 --> 00:09:47,702
As soon as you have
a good grasp on that,

189
00:09:47,786 --> 00:09:50,789
your abilities will begin
to grow quite rapidly!

190
00:09:50,872 --> 00:09:52,791
That was an impressive display.

191
00:09:52,874 --> 00:09:55,627
Your magic type is similar to
that of one of my subordinates,

192
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:59,130
but it's much faster and
far more powerful than hers is.

193
00:09:59,214 --> 00:10:01,508
[SARADO] It seems you Clover
Kingdom mages rely solely

194
00:10:01,591 --> 00:10:04,344
on your own mana, without
making use of the natural mana

195
00:10:04,427 --> 00:10:06,221
that always surrounds you.

196
00:10:06,304 --> 00:10:08,014
[MIMOSA]
That sounds complicated,

197
00:10:08,098 --> 00:10:09,099
but we'll do our best.

198
00:10:09,182 --> 00:10:10,475
[CHARLOTTE]
How does it work?

199
00:10:10,558 --> 00:10:11,685
Easy!

200
00:10:11,768 --> 00:10:13,269
First, you gather it
all up from a big area,

201
00:10:13,353 --> 00:10:14,521
with a "ker-swoosh!"

202
00:10:14,604 --> 00:10:17,732
Then "kablammo,"
you're good to go!

203
00:10:17,816 --> 00:10:19,401
I'm sorry, but I
think we'll need you

204
00:10:19,484 --> 00:10:21,361
to be more specific.

205
00:10:21,444 --> 00:10:23,488
[SARADO] You sense the mana,
like "ding-ding-ding!"

206
00:10:23,571 --> 00:10:25,699
Then once you've got it,
you just have to go "whoosh!"

207
00:10:25,782 --> 00:10:26,908
You know?

208
00:10:26,991 --> 00:10:29,119
Then we'll get into the
technical stuff later.

209

--I didn't get a word of that.
--[MIMOSA] Sorry, I didn't get

[SMURIK]
The gusts from the mountains,

the breeze off the ocean, it
all passes through this valley.

[FINRAL]
Oh, okay.

216
00:10:49,556 --> 00:10:51,725
That must be why
it's so windy here.

217
00:10:51,808 --> 00:10:53,059
I have heard about the young man

218
00:10:53,143 --> 00:10:55,270
who was chosen
by the Wind Spirit.

219
00:10:55,353 --> 00:10:57,439
I was very eager to meet him.

220
00:10:57,522 --> 00:11:00,233
[FINRAL]
Right, you mean Asta's rival.

221
00:11:00,316 --> 00:11:02,610
But then, you were
sent here instead.

222
00:11:02,694 --> 00:11:05,613
There must be
a reason. I wonder.

223
00:11:05,697 --> 00:11:07,323
I mean, I'm sure
Gaja just figured

224
00:11:07,407 --> 00:11:09,576
we'd be a good match, is all.

225
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,121
Huh?

226
00:11:17,167 --> 00:11:19,294
Well? It's your move.

Is this training?

That's a dumb question,
I know, but I really can't tell.

230
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:35,143
[SMURIK] Whether this is
for training or a real battle,

231
00:11:35,226 --> 00:11:37,979
the wind that blows between

232
00:11:38,063 --> 00:11:39,981
Don't you agree?

233
00:11:40,065 --> 00:11:42,400
[FINRAL] I can't seem
to figure this guy out.

What is he acting
so intense for?

235
00:11:44,861 --> 00:11:46,613
[SMURIK]
Spatial Magic is mainly meant

236
00:11:46,696 --> 00:11:48,490
for supporting your friends.

237
00:11:48,573 --> 00:11:50,533
That is what you believe, yes?

238
00:11:50,617 --> 00:11:52,285
[FINRAL]
Yeah, and?

239
00:11:52,369 --> 00:11:54,454
Well, then, if an
enemy targets you,

240
00:11:54,537 --> 00:11:57,415
do you expect your friends
to come to your rescue?

Don't be a liability.

Let me see your magic ability.

[LEOPOLD]
Flame Magic: Spiral Flames!

255

All right, if this is what
you can do at 80 percent,

256
00:12:38,081 --> 00:12:40,583
then I'd say you've got
incredible potential!

257
00:12:40,667 --> 00:12:44,421
That's nice, but if you ask me,
this isn't nearly good enough.

258
00:12:44,504 --> 00:12:47,507
I need to learn everything I can
and get a whole lot stronger.

259

No way I'm gonna let this
opportunity go to waste.

doesn't come off as rude,

00:12:57,517 --> 00:12:59,394
That way I can judge for myself

whether I can learn
much from you.

Your potential is far
greater than mine.

276
00:13:30,592 --> 00:13:32,552
Once you learn how
to harness natural mana,

277
00:13:32,635 --> 00:13:34,804
you shouldn't have any
problem pulling off techniques

278
00:13:34,888 --> 00:13:37,515
that are even more impressive
than I just showed you.

279
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,435
You will get there,

280
00:13:40,518 --> 00:13:44,439
but gaining full control over
natural mana is no easy feat.

for taking me under your wing!

Oh, man, c'mon!

Too weak?

You're about at the fifth
stage, but in order to use

287
00:14:06,586 --> 00:14:08,505
these techniques in battle,
you'll need to reach

288
00:14:08,588 --> 00:14:10,715
at least third stage or higher.

[POTROF]
This is a good spot.

00:15:02,017 --> 00:15:03,852
So, what are you
gonna teach me first?

305
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:06,479
How to bask in natural mana!

306
00:15:06,563 --> 00:15:10,775
All the plants and animals, the
ground, water, wind, sunlight.

00:15:10,859 --> 00:15:13,153
This place is filled
to the brim with life!

308
00:15:13,236 --> 00:15:15,989
Which means it's
also rich with mana.

309
00:15:16,072 --> 00:15:17,407
Now that you say something,

310
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:19,659
I think I'm already
getting a feel for it!

311
00:15:19,743 --> 00:15:22,120
Good! Never let go
of that feeling!

312
00:15:22,203 --> 00:15:25,540
You need mana words in order
to master our techniques.

313
00:15:25,623 --> 00:15:26,666
Listen close.

314
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,501
Once you become one
with natural mana,

315
00:15:28,585 --> 00:15:30,962
you'll be able to use
those words for spells!

316
00:15:36,509 --> 00:15:38,636
That's amazing!
You know, just watching

317
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,347
the creative way that
you use your magic

318
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:43,308
is giving me a serious
burst of inspiration!

319
00:15:43,391 --> 00:15:44,809
[POTROF]
Then you should try it!

320
00:15:44,893 --> 00:15:47,479
Use mana words however
your heart desires.

321
00:15:47,562 --> 00:15:51,524
It might not be perfect
at first, but that's fine.

322
00:15:51,608 --> 00:15:52,609
[RILL]
Okay!

323
00:15:57,864 --> 00:16:00,116
Not bad. There were
no mana words, but--

324
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,286
[RILL] Ooh! The need to create
is welling up inside me!

325
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:04,746
Wait, I've got an idea.

326
00:16:04,829 --> 00:16:06,790
I can see that you're
an excellent painter,

327
00:16:06,873 --> 00:16:09,334
so let's try writing them
this time instead.

328
00:16:09,417 --> 00:16:12,379
Look, think, read, and write!

329
00:16:12,462 --> 00:16:13,838
[RILL]
Like this?

330
00:16:15,632 --> 00:16:17,550
Whoa, look at that!

331
00:16:17,634 --> 00:16:18,677
Oh, my!

332
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,179
And after only
seeing them one time!

333
00:16:21,262 --> 00:16:23,807
Well, don't stop now.

334
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:25,642
No, not the painting part!

335
00:16:25,725 --> 00:16:27,519
[RILL]
Thanks for your help, Potrof.

336
00:16:27,602 --> 00:16:31,147
I think this masterpiece will
be even better because of you!

337
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:32,774
[POTROF]
Not the point.

338
00:16:35,485 --> 00:16:36,986
[CHARMY grunts]

339
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,113
Hey.

340
00:16:38,196 --> 00:16:39,823
You're one of the
Black Bulls, right?

341
00:16:39,906 --> 00:16:42,617
Actually, I know her as
Queen Loropechika's pet--

342
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:45,537
er, excuse me. I mean
her guest, of course.

343
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,831
Weren't you eating
back at the palace?

344
00:16:47,914 --> 00:16:49,958
Well, yeah, but I
kinda-sorta ate everything

345
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:51,918
they had there, so I
figured I might as well

346
00:16:52,002 --> 00:16:54,337
go searching for new
and undiscovered treats!

347
00:16:54,421 --> 00:16:57,590
You're saying that you devoured
all of the palace's supply?

348
00:16:57,674 --> 00:16:58,925
[CHARMY]
Uh-huh!

349
00:16:59,009 --> 00:17:00,593
All right, then. Since you
traveled all this way

350
00:17:00,677 --> 00:17:02,595
to the Heart Kingdom,
how would you like to learn

351
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:05,056
some of our special
combat techniques?

352
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,850
That doesn't really
line up with my goal

353
00:17:06,933 --> 00:17:09,060
of eating all the
delicious noms I can find.

354
00:17:09,144 --> 00:17:10,854
Aw, don't be that way!

355
00:17:10,937 --> 00:17:12,981
Look, these are
called mana words.

356
00:17:13,064 --> 00:17:15,108
They often come in handy.

357
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:27,245
[POTROF]
Wow! We've got another prodigy!

358
00:17:27,328 --> 00:17:29,831
But your execution could
still use some work.

359
00:17:29,914 --> 00:17:32,167
The secret to that is,
you have to be in touch

360
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,376
with the natural mana.

361
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,003
[CHARMY] There must
be more succulent fruit

362
00:17:35,086 --> 00:17:37,213
somewhere in these woods!

363
00:17:37,297 --> 00:17:39,257
I bet if we venture a bit
deeper into the forest,

364
00:17:39,341 --> 00:17:40,800
I'll find some
scenery that really

365
00:17:40,884 --> 00:17:42,844
gets my creative juices flowing!

366
00:17:42,927 --> 00:17:44,971
[POTROF] I'm begging you,
just listen to me

367
00:17:45,055 --> 00:17:47,057
for a few minutes, please!

368
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:51,644
[NOELLE] Queen Loropechika,
we're ready to learn

369
00:17:51,728 --> 00:17:53,480
from you and Undine.

370
00:17:53,563 --> 00:17:55,065
[LOROPECHIKA]
Of course.

371
00:17:55,148 --> 00:17:58,651
But first, there's something I'd
like to bring to your attention.

372
00:17:58,735 --> 00:18:01,863
I need you to rescue me.

373
00:18:01,946 --> 00:18:06,618
If nothing changes, I'll be
killed by this curse, and soon.

374
00:18:06,701 --> 00:18:07,786
You'll be okay.

375
00:18:07,869 --> 00:18:10,080
We'll stop the devil
before that happens.

376
00:18:10,163 --> 00:18:12,374
That's why we
came here to train.

377
00:18:12,457 --> 00:18:14,626
[LOROPECHIKA] We are the ones
who will defeat Megicula.

378
00:18:14,709 --> 00:18:20,173
[gasps] Sorry, could you
explain what you mean by that?

379
00:18:20,256 --> 00:18:21,549
[LOROPECHIKA]
Obviously, striking down

380
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:23,677
the Spade Kingdom's invasion
will require the help

381
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,721
of the other
Magic Knights, but...

382
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:29,057
Megicula's inside someone.

383
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,142
An extremely powerful mage.

384
00:18:31,226 --> 00:18:33,353
Her name is Vanica.

385
00:18:33,436 --> 00:18:35,146
The only way we'll
even stand a chance

386
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:38,983
against a foe like her is if
Undine and I work together

387
00:18:39,067 --> 00:18:41,903
with the two of you.

388
00:18:41,986 --> 00:18:43,196
And you already have an idea

389
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:45,990
of what this Vanica person
can do, is that it?

390
00:18:46,074 --> 00:18:47,909
She sounds pretty tough.

391
00:18:47,992 --> 00:18:50,787
Well, since I'm the
Water Spirit, it's my job

392
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:54,040
to fight alongside the queen
and to protect her from danger.

393
00:18:54,124 --> 00:18:55,625
But the two of us were no match

394
00:18:55,709 --> 00:18:58,169
for Vanica's
astounding power.

395
00:18:58,253 --> 00:19:01,923
Because of my weakness,
Her Majesty must live in fear

396
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:03,925
of her impending death.

397
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:07,345
No. Please don't ever blame
yourself for my curse, Undine.

398
00:19:07,429 --> 00:19:09,180
A person who has been
possessed by a devil

399
00:19:09,264 --> 00:19:11,933
cannot be defeated
by normal means.

400
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:14,060
I get it. So, by teaming
up with me and Nero,

401
00:19:14,144 --> 00:19:15,895
you get some kind of
special advantage

402
00:19:15,979 --> 00:19:18,523
that should be enough
to stop her, right?

403
00:19:18,606 --> 00:19:20,984
[LOROPECHIKA] We can't be
sure of that just yet.

404
00:19:21,067 --> 00:19:23,069
But I've come to the conclusion
that the four of us

405
00:19:23,153 --> 00:19:24,821
working together
creates the best

406
00:19:24,904 --> 00:19:27,699
possible scenario for victory.

407
00:19:27,782 --> 00:19:29,576
Noelle. I hope the two of you

408
00:19:29,659 --> 00:19:33,413
will agree to cooperate with us
and save Loropechika's life.

409
00:19:33,496 --> 00:19:35,999
[LOROPECHIKA]
With Nero's arcane-stage spells

410
00:19:36,082 --> 00:19:40,462
and your combative spirit
and fighting style--

411
00:19:40,545 --> 00:19:42,422
if we four train hard,

412
00:19:42,505 --> 00:19:44,841
then we'll become
a formidable team.

413
00:19:44,924 --> 00:19:49,846
And then hopefully, we can
overpower Vanica and Megicula!

414
00:19:49,929 --> 00:19:55,226
All of that makes sense to me.
Nero. Can we count you in, too?

415
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,603
We're grateful!

416
00:19:56,686 --> 00:19:57,854
[NOELLE]
No need for that.

417
00:19:57,937 --> 00:20:00,231
Trust me, I've my own reasons

418
00:20:00,315 --> 00:20:03,485
for wanting to be the
one to kill Megicula!

419
00:20:03,568 --> 00:20:06,946
Good, then we agree.
Let's begin our training.

420
00:20:09,532 --> 00:20:11,826
Go ahead, and don't hold back!

The power to invalidate magic
is second to nothing.

00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:17,517

[GAJA] A fighting style that

enough to sustain you forever.

[GAJA] To truly unleash your
abilities, it's only logical

442
00:21:37,495 --> 00:21:40,290
that you use them to back up
your allies, as well.

443

Let me try one more time!

[YAMI]
So? Are you seein' any progress?

450
00:22:00,769 --> 00:22:02,520
[FINRAL] It looks like
everybody's gotten the hang

of the Heart Kingdom's
special techniques.

452

If it's like this every day,

I'd be surprised if we weren't
crazy-tough at the end.

[FINRAL]
Right!

up my game, as well.
