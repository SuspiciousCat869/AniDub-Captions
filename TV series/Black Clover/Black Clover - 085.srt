1
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:15,625
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:18,625
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:24,375
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:27,041
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,541
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:39,666
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:45,708
[YUNO] I'll win.
Even if he is a captain.

8
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:46,875
I'll win!

9
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:48,250
[NARRATOR]
The test to see who would fight

10
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:51,083
the Eye of the Midnight
Sun was winding down.

11
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:54,916
There! See? You're
getting it now!

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,125
Huh?

13
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:04,166
[NARRATOR] The end result
was a victory for Yuno,

14
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:07,083
Noelle, and En of Team P.

15
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:09,791
Then, the identity of
the mysterious mage

16
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:13,000
who called himself
Xerx was unveiled.

17
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:14,333
[JULIUS]
We need your Trap Magic

18
00:01:14,416 --> 00:01:16,500
and your ability
to think critically.

19
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:19,500
The exam is done,
and you likely passed.

20
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:21,833
I hope you'll join.

21
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:24,166
Isn't it time that
you wore your robe?

22
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:29,125
The robe of your true
squad, Zora Ideale.

23
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:30,625
[ZORA sighs]

24
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:34,208
[ZORA] Don't know who
you're talkin' about.

25
00:01:36,958 --> 00:01:38,500
[ZORA]
Me?

26
00:01:38,583 --> 00:01:40,833
I'm just some lame
excuse for a supermage

27
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:43,208
who happened to be
passing through.

28
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:21,958
Hey, look. Asta isn't
budging an inch!

29
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:23,500
He's just like a statue!

30
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:25,291
[GREY]
Um, is he still breathing?

31
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:28,875
Yeah, as far as I can tell,
but he isn't himself.

32
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:32,291
Losing the tournament must
have hit him really hard.

33
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:34,625
He seemed awfully
busted up over it.

34
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:36,458
I will catch up to you.

35
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:39,375
I will be the
Wizard King. I swear!

36
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:40,958
Can't blame the poor guy.

37
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:43,291
Not only did his childhood
buddy win the whole thing,

38
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:44,833
but I don't think
Asta was expecting him

39
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:46,250
to have that much power.

40
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:47,708
And the shock of being surpassed

41
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:49,875
by his long-standing rival
may keep getting worse

42
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:51,708
with every day that passes.

43
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:54,041
Trust me, I understand
the feeling.

44
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:57,125
My sister, my goddess, Marie.

45
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:58,916
Each day I have to
endure without seeing

46
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,083
your beautiful smile,
the damage to my body

47
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,541
and soul grows ever deeper.

48
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:03,875
Forgive me for being so blunt,

49
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:06,916
but I don't think that's
the same thing at all.

50
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,833
Hey I know. Maybe I need
to launch a little

51
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,375
surprise attack on him!

52
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:13,041
Nothin' cheers a person up like
a fun life-or-death battle!

53
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:15,125
Lightning Magic:
Thunderbolt Destruc--

54
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:16,375
[NOELLE]
Don't you dare!

55
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,541
Fighting is not going
to help Asta right now!

56
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,750
We won't know for
sure unless we try!

57
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:22,166
[NOELLE]
I think it's safe to assume!

58
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,583
[MAGNA]
You'll kill him!

59
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,000
Well, if I can't use magic,

60
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,708
then can I at least
pummel him with a brick?

61
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:28,583
[NOELLE, MAGNA]
So not happening!

62
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:29,833
[mumbling] As your closest
and dearest friend,

63
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:31,083
I completely
understand your pain.

64
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:32,666
that's why I, the
loyal Gordon Agrippa,

65
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,291
will be happy to gently
massage your temples

66
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:37,583
until you feel better.
Oh, excuse me. Wait.

67
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:39,958
[VANESSA]
Come on, Asta.

68
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:42,958
Why are you still sitting here
staring into space, huh?

69
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:44,083
Is this because you couldn't go

70
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:46,541
up against that
lady-killer Yuno?

71
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,250
It's okay, right, Rouge?

72
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:49,500
[ROUGE meows]

73
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:51,541
Even if it didn't go
quite like you wanted,

74
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,166
you did great out there, kiddo.

75
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,666
I'm sure you passed
with flyin' colors!

76
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,708
[laughs]

77
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:59,625
So gimme a big
smile, okay, honey?

78
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:03,416
You better smile, or I'm
gonna make ya smile!

79
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:08,500
[MAGNA] What the heck
is she tryin' to do?

80
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:10,458
[GREY sniffles]
That's so nice!

81
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:12,541
She's acting excessively
cheerful in an attempt

82
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,166
to bring Asta out of his funk!

83
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,333
[MAGNA, LUCK, NOELLE]
Huh?

84
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:18,125
Yeah. I'm familiar
with the tactic.

85
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:20,625
I act that way on the outside
to conceal my sadness

86
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:21,875
when I can't be around Marie.

87
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:23,541
Well, what are we
waiting for, everyone?

88
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:25,666
We need to follow her
lead and be positive!

89
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,291
You're right, that idiot
needs a confidence boost!

90
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,416
Oh, nice! So does that mean
I can start attacking him now?

91
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,500
What is wrong with you?

92
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:32,916
[LUCK]
Hi-yah!

93
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,333
What did I just say, Luck?

94
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:38,416
Are you still alive, Asta?

95
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:43,791
Hey, wait, isn't it
about that time?

96
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:46,791
To see the Royal Knights
Selection Exam results.

97
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:47,958
They're supposed
to be coming here

98
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:49,708
by owl post really soon.

99
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:52,458
Oh, that's right, guess it
must've slipped my mind.

100
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:56,041
That owl post should show up
any minute now, Asta!

101
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:57,666
Look. Once you make the cut,

102
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,291
you're gonna catch back up
to Mr. Cool in no time!

103
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:02,750
Then you can leave
him in the dust!

104
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:05,458
I'm not so sure.
Will I even get in?

105
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,791
I mean, I did get
eliminated, remember?

106
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:11,291
Don't sweat the small stuff,
sweetie! Ha, ha, ha!

107
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:13,875
She's right; you need to have
some more faith in yourself!

108
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:15,208
[mumbling] But, Noelle...

109
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,166
Of course, I did win in
the finals, so obviously,

110
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,166
I'm going to be selected
for the Royal Knights.

111
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,875
Results like that
speak for themselves.

112
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,791
You only won because
you were lucky enough

113
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24,625
to be on the same
team as Pretty Boy!

114
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:26,250
That's still better than you!

115
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:28,125
Your magic was what
caused your team to lose!

116
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:29,833
I can't believe you
would dare to address

117
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:31,291
your superior like that!

118
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,500
Don't you talk to me like
I'm some clueless rookie!

119
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,166
I am royalty, ya know!

120
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,625
And nobody cares, ya know!

121
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:39,333
I'm sorry, but could you
two please stop arguing?

122
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:40,625
[MAGNA]
Huh?

123
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:43,500
Fine! Whatever. Just stop
worrying about Asta

124
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,166
and concentrate on
your own chances.

125
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,416
Huh?

126
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,250
But there's nothin' for
me to be worried about!

127
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:49,916
I totally made it into
the Royal Knights,

128
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,833
so I ain't sweatin' it one bit!

129
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:53,250
You what I'm sayin'?

130
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:56,208
Wow, Magna, you're completely
terrified, aren't you?

131
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:59,083
No way, don't be
stupid! I'm cool!

132
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:00,458
[mumbling] Judging by
your racing pulse,

133
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:02,416
your elevated temperature,
and the amount of sweat

134
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,958
you're producing,
it's easy for me to see

135
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:05,458
that you're extremely
nervous right now.

136
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:07,208
All right, fine,
I suppose I can make

137
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:09,958
an exception this once.
To lift your spirits,

138
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:11,500
I'll let you look
at Marie's photograph

139
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:13,125
for three-and-a-half seconds.

140
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:16,083
I've got a way better idea.
Spar with me, Asta!

141
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:17,125
Huh?

142
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:18,708
I bet you're already
feeling better!

143
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:20,583
Stop it! There's no
way he's better!

144
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:22,833
Let me hit him with one
full-throttle attack!

145
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,208
I told you, you can't!

146
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:26,583
Oh, no! Charmy!

147
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:30,500
[VANESSA] Hm? What's
gotten into you, girl?

148
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,375
I can't stop thinking
about how cool

149
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,333
Yuno was during that battle.

150
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:36,125
It's making my chest
tighten so much

151
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:38,750
that I can barley
swallow any food.

152
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,000
I've only eaten a fifth of it.

153
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:42,833
[GAUCHE, MANGA]
Yeah, you're fine.

154
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:46,166
You're not gonna say anything?

155
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,000
Oh, man, this is serious.

156
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:50,250
My incredible
Savior of Sustenance,

157

aching for you.

I'm pretty sure
that's heartburn.

in bad shape, too.

What's this about a bath?

You're bound to cheer up

Come on, let's go.

Thanks, but I don't
really feel up to it.

Your captain orders you to,

so quit your bellyachin'
and get in!

What'd I tell ya?

00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:32,708
A nice bath like this is just
what the doctor ordered.

173
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:33,666
I guess so.

one more time,
you understand me?

[mumbling] Together in the bath,
my companions and I share

a blissful moment of connection.

About what?

[YAMI]
Shut yer yap and I'll tell ya.

191
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:19,166
It reminds me of a time
when I'd just joined up

192
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:23,125
with a Magic Knight Squad
by the name of the Gray Deer.

193
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:26,000
They're called the Aqua Deer
now, but this happened

194
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,708
back when ol' Julius
was their captain,

195
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,125
so the name was different then.

196
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:30,458
That makes sense.

197
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:33,166
That's good, now be quiet
and listen to the story.

198
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,666
I'd been doin'
some warrior training

199
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,958
to beef myself up a bit, right?

so I decided to try
catchin' some fish.

00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:48,166
But then...

205

I could eat a horse
right now, I'm so hungry.

[YAMI] Fishin' is a breeze
out on the open sea,

really isn't my style.

use something to eat.

we so diligently
grew and harvested,

then they come along and
steal everything from us

what's happening.

one tiny termite to sink
a massive galleon.

there's strength in numbers!

Right!

319
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,625
Huh.

320
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,875
[YAMI] They're not really
a threat by themselves,

321
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:24,375
but there's too
damn many of 'em!

322
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,416
What's the plan?

323
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,250
[BANDITS yell]

but cut you down one by one!

[WILLIAM]
I'm not an enemy.

330
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:13,750
[YAMI] Weird shoes. Weird pants.
Weird clothes. Weird cape.

331
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:16,875
And that mask.
It's goofy as hell!

332
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,750
You say you're not,
but you look pretty shady

333
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:21,041
in that peacock
costume of yours!

334
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:28,375
Yami, I believe your name was?

335
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:30,583
Watch my back,
if you wouldn't mind.

336
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:31,916
Hey. Wait.

337
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,333
I don't remember tellin'
you what my name was, pal.

338
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:37,041

This guy...

00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:55,583
He moves like he's able to
read my mind or something!

343
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:58,583
Our ki must be on
the same wavelength!

344
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:05,000
No. What happened?

345
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:08,125
How did the two of you
take down so many?

346
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:11,125
Well, that's done.

347
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:12,875
[YAMI]
Now there's just you!

348
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,708
Make a portal, hurry!

349
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:16,875
[BANDIT 85G]
Yes, sir!

350
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,375
Hey, shrimp.

351
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:27,625
Why'd you stay here and let
your boss get away? Huh?

352
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,333
The bandits' boss may
have barely slipped

353
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:37,041
through our fingers,
but we did round up

354
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:40,291
all of his underlings.
They won't be attacking this

355
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:43,583
or any other village
for a long while.

356
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:46,125
[YAMI]
You got that right.

357
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:50,125
Now. You never did
give me a clear answer.

358
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:52,291
I think I'd remember if
I met somebody like you,

359
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,041
so how did you know my name?

360
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:56,291
[WILLIAM]
Oh, yes, you did ask me that.

361
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,875
The truth is, you're famous.

362
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:00,583
The roughneck from
a foreign land

363
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:02,250
who was chosen to
join the Gray Deer

364
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:04,791
isn't easily forgotten about.

365
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,791
Uh-huh.

366
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:09,500
All right, then tell
me who you are.

367
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:13,125
Actually, I am also a
member of the Gray Deer.

368
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:14,583
[YAMI]
Huh?

369
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:15,958
[WILLIAM] You see, my own
missions tend to take place

370
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:17,625
in the royal capital,
so you and I have

371
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:19,666
never crossed paths before this.

372
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,500
Today's assignment just
happened to be near here.

373
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:27,916
Yeah. Now that you mention it,
I did hear somethin' about

374
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,916
a newbie with a stupid
mask joining up,

375
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,166
so that musta been you.

376
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,583
[laughs] You think it's stupid?

377
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,583
This mask was a gift
from someone special,

378
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:36,958
so that kind of hurts.

379
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:39,666
From someone special, huh?

380
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:43,583
Well, it was sweet of them
to give you a gift 'n' all,

381
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:46,791
but it's still ridiculous.
Who the hell was it?

382
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,625
Who indeed.

383
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:03,375
Thank you, Sir Yami.

384
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:06,083
Now, our humble village
can prosper again!

385
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:08,458
[VILLAGERS] We appreciate
all your help, Sir Yami!

386
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:10,958
You've protected our
harvest for years to come!

387
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:13,041
Hey, don't worry about it.

388
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:16,375
I mean, I did get myself a good
meal out of this, after all.

389
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:17,666
Take care!

390
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,750
You want a bite of this bread?

391
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,708
That's all right, thank you.

392
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:32,250
You were the person
the village hired,

393
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:34,500
I believe you should
reap the rewards.

394
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:36,166
Suit yourself.

395
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:39,708
Where are you off to next?

396
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:42,041
[YAMI]
I'm headed back to training.

397
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:44,166
Feel free to join me.

398
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,500
[WILLIAM]
Sounds nice.

399
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:49,000
I'm sure things can be
exciting with you around.

400
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:50,583
But I must decline.

401
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:53,125
I have a mission of my own
I need to attend to.

402
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:55,666
I'll bid you farewell
and be on my way.

403
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,500
Best of luck.

404
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,458
[YAMI]
Mm-hm.

405
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:01,041
[WILLIAM]
But, you know...

406
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:03,375
Even though we have
different goals now,

407
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:06,625
I suspect we'll walk the
same path in the future.

408
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:08,666
And just what path is that?

409
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:19,041
[YAMI] Sounds good. I guess
that makes you my rival.

410
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:20,458
I intend to become the captain

411
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:25,125
of a Magic Knight Squad.
Before you do, that is.

412
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:27,750
Yeah right, you'll
never beat me.

413
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,541
Then it's a contest.

414
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:33,541
Let's see who gets
there first. Ha.

415
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:36,791
[YAMI]
Hey! Wait a minute, mask boy!

416
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:40,416
You never got around
to telling me your name.

417
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,791
Oh, right. It's
William Vangeance.

418
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,416
I shoulda known.

419
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,208
Your name is as weird
as your outfit.

420
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:52,416
[WILLIAM]
We'll meet again. Yami.

421
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,083
Yeah, see ya!

422
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:03,625
All right! Time for
me to get goin', too.

00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:10,000
[YAMI]
That's it.

424
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:13,583
That's the story of how
I met that masked goofball.

425
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:16,833
And the first time he
and I fought side by side.

426
