Losing a man like Fuegoleon

The consequences

No, it's our inexperience
that's to blame.

And there's something else.

We discovered that the pendant

114
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:22,916
Fuegoleon was wearing
has disappeared.

115
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,416
It's missing?

116
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,166
[CHARLOTTE] Perhaps they staged
the attack to acquire it.

117
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,708
Do you have any idea
who they are, sir?

118

Well, no, but...

119
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,083
There have been rumors lately,
and from what they said,

120
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:36,833
it sounds like they have
a grudge against the kingdom.

121
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:39,458
[GEORK] We are the
Eye of the Midnight Sun,

122
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:43,333
and we will bring the
Clover Kingdom to its knees.

123
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:47,000
However, I suspect it's
not as simple as that.

124
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:50,208
[JULIUS] The multicolored jewels
embedded in that tablet...

125
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:51,708
They were arranged in a pattern,

126
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:53,833
but some of the spots
were still empty.

127
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:55,291
Could Fuegoleon's
pendant have been

128
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:56,791
one of the missing jewels?

129
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,750
What happens when
they're all in place?

130
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,916
It's possible that
Charlotte is right,

131
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,500
and they targeted
Fuegoleon because

132
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:05,291
the jewel was in his possession.

133
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,833
However, it's equally likely

134
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:09,166
that they sought to disable
him because they worried

135
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:12,833
he'd interfere with the
achievement of their goals.

136
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:14,875
We've been covertly
investigating a number

137
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:17,083
of dissidents, but this
is the first time

138
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:19,750
I've been able to link
them to a single group.

139
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,625
They're stronger
than I anticipated.

140
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:25,250
This was a large-scale attack
backed by immense power.

141
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:29,250
Perhaps I should have
remained in the capital.

142
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:32,291
We'll interrogate the
prisoner for answers later.

Whoever they are.

144
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:37,000
I ask only one thing
from the Magic Knights,

145
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:40,125
that you preserve the peace
of the Clover Kingdom.

146
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:42,333
To achieve that, we must
put everything on the line

147
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:43,625

have awoken an eagle, instead.

This mark means I'm

my limitations
and becoming king.

183

It is the House Vermillion

went over my head,

[NARRATOR]
The Wizard King had concluded

197
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,750
that the attack on the
royal capital was the work

198
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:58,708
of terrorists targeting
the Clover Kingdom.

199
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,375
In a public speech,
he made clear

200
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:03,416
his determination to
continue to fight.

201
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,000

this declaration

with wholehearted support.

203
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,291
The invasion was
only possible because

204
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:11,666
some of the mages in charge
of maintaining the city's

205

[NARRATOR]
After assessing the situation,

00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:25,083
the Wizard King came
to his own conclusion,

210
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:27,625
but it was not one he
wished to make public.

[JULIUS] As much as I
don't want to believe it,

as is the breadth of his power.

226

He's most likely the one
who brought down Fuegoleon.

00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:04,833
What's the matter with you?

316
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:07,458
Aren't you at least gonna
say "hi" or somethin'?

317
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:09,291
[yelps] How do you
know my prince?

318
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,583
Oh, you think you're
too good for me

319
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:13,541
'cause you're super
powerful now? Come on.

320
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:16,333
I don't think a simple
"hello" is gonna kill ya.

[MIMOSA, KLAUS gasp]

I may have overdone it.

327
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:52,708
What did you do that for?
Are you crazy?

328
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:54,666
[ASTA] Jeez, I was
just teasin' the guy.

329
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:59,333
I didn't think he'd actually
try to kill me for it.

330
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:01,666
[YUNO]
Later, little Rasta.

331
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,791
Okay, that's it! You're an
even bigger jerk now!

332
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,291
You wanna go? Let's do it.

333
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:08,458
I'm ready when you are!

334
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:10,208
Get down here and
fight me face-to-face--

335
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:11,625
we'll see who's stronger!

336
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:13,750
Hey! Don't you
walk away from me!

337
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:15,666
The fierce winds of true love.

338
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,333
Ah, my prince!

339
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:19,625
You can't go around
ignoring people like that!

340
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,708
Come back. Yuno, wait!

341
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:23,208
[ASTA] Think you can just
blast me with magic...

342
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:25,583
[KLAUS] Yuno's magic has
gotten far more powerful

343
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,083
than it used to be.

344
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:30,000
What could have happened to
cause such a sudden change?

345
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:37,541
[MIMOSA] Asta. I'm going
to get stronger.

346
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:39,208
The next time we face
an enemy together,

347
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:41,500
I'll be able to
fight by your side.

348
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:42,708
And then...

349
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:44,125
And then...

350
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,958
[MIMOSA giggles]

351
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,541
We'll have our showdown,
but it can wait

352
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:54,291
until we're both more powerful.

353
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:56,416
[ASTA]
I'm not gonna lose, Yuno.

354
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,166
No matter how strong you get,

355
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:01,041
I'm gonna get even stronger!

356
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:02,625
[NOELLE chuckles]

357
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:06,916
[ASTA] Hey, guys, welcome back.
How'd the mission go?

358
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,666
Not too bad, but, man,
I am wiped out.

359
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,041
It was exhausting.

360
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:14,125
Worth it, though.
We did so well out there,

361
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:16,541
we earned ourselves
a shiny new star!

362
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:18,333
[ASTA]
That's so awesome!

363
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:19,916
--Tell 'em the rest, too.
--[MAGNA] Too close.

364
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,291
Like about our combo move,

365
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:24,458
the Crackling Magna Typhoon
and how amazing it was.

366
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:27,916
[MAGNA]
Don't use that move ever again.

367
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,833
[mumbling] I wish I could have
been there with you guys.

368
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:31,500
That's right, the way
things are goin',

369
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:34,333
I'm gonna be leadin'
this squad in no time.

370
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:37,916
Get ready! We're entering
the Age of Magna.

371
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,500
Stick with me, kid--
you're gonna go places.

372
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:42,083
[ASTA]
Yes, sir! Oh, Magna, by the way.

373
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:43,166
What up?

374
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,541
[ASTA]
After the attack on the capital,

375
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:47,041
there was a special
Distinguished Service Ceremony,

376
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,541
and I guess I did okay,

377
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:50,875
because they made me a Junior
Magic Knight, Third Class!

378
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:52,458
[laughs]

379
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:54,083
[BOTH gasp]

380
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:55,500
Wait!

381
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:57,583
What the heck is a Junior
Magic Knight, Third Class?

382
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:58,416
Well...

383
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,666
[yells]

384
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:03,166
[YAMI] Idiots. You've been
here how long now,

385
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,291
and you don't know what it is?

386
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:10,083
See, there's a
Knights ranking system.

387
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:12,500
You two clowns haven't
advanced since you joined up,

388
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:15,666
so you're still only Junior
Magic Knights, Fifth Class.

389
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,750
Best show Asta some respect.

390
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:18,791
[BOTH]
Wha...?

391
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:19,875
[YAMI]
And they made Charmy here

392
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:22,166
a Junior Magic Knight,
First Class.

393
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,500
Yes, inferiors, bow before me!

394
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,625
--[LUCK laughs]
--[MAGNA] Wha...?!

395
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:28,250
[CHARMY]
Here's your place, peons.

396
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:31,083
Behind the great and
powerful Charmy Pappitson.

397
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:33,916
[sputtering]

398
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,708
Apparently, she captured
one of the attackers.

399
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:39,083
I think she was just trying
to beat her up, but whatever.

400
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:40,875
[CHARMY]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

401
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:42,916
no, no, no, no!

402
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,416
Good boys. Feel free
to worship me now.

403
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:49,916
What's up with the
freaky little dance?

404
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,791
I'm sensing a little bit
of resentment here.

405
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:55,791
Anyway, that was some
good work out there, kid.

406
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:58,791
But, what if Captain
Fuegoleon never wakes up?

407
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:01,666
[YAMI] Huh? Fuegoleon?
Ae you kidding me?

408
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,541
You're worried
about him? Come on.

409
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:06,250
That flame-throwing,
stiff-necked royal

410
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,541
is too stubborn
to die that easily.

411
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:09,541
He'll probably just wake up

412
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:12,291
even stronger than
he was before.

413
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:15,125
Yeah, you're right! Okay!

414
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:18,041
I better get to my training so
I can be all pumped-up, too!

415
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:20,250
No way, kid. You need to rest.

416
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:22,000
--Huh?
--[YAMI] You're too banged up.

Hey, who's the one who made me

419

go in the first place?

420
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:28,208
He's right. Just
take some time off.

421
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:29,208
Not you, too!

422

Don't be an idiot.

423
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:32,250
Time off, huh?

You got some free time, Asta?

doin' this crap?

Okay, so obviously, the
Wizard King is at the top,

then after that, you've got
your Grand Magic Knight.

Man, this is boring.
