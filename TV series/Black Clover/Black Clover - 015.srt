1
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,625
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:18,416
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:24,416
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,166
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:35,541
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:39,833
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:42,666
[NARRATOR] A dungeon
surfaced near the border

8
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,208
between the Clover
and Diamond Kingdoms.

9
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:47,833
Asta, Noelle, and Luck of
the Black Bulls were dispatched

10
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:49,791
to explore it and
prevent the treasures

11
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:52,583
concealed within from
falling into enemy hands.

12
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:55,625
Whoa! This is like,
the most awesome place ever!

13
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,083
Hey, take a look at this, Asta.

14
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:02,250
Right there.

15
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:04,125
I don't see anything.

16
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:04,750
[LUCK]
Closer.

17
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:07,708
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

18
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:09,666
[screams]

19
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,500
[NARRATOR]
The dungeon was thick with mana

20
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:13,125
and teeming with traps.

21
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:15,833
Wow, the looks on your faces!

22
00:01:15,916 --> 00:01:17,458
That was fun, huh?

23
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:19,125
I could play in this
place all day!

24
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:20,625
[BOTH panting]

25
00:01:20,708 --> 00:01:23,458
[ASTA, NOELLE] This guy is
totally going to get us killed.

26
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,583
Now, let's see what we've got.

27
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:28,750
[LUCK]
I'm just about at my limit.

28
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:31,958
[LUCK]
I knew it.

29
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:35,208
We're not alone in here.

30
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:37,750
And the strongest
of them all is...

31
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:41,208
Sorry guys, but something
important's come up.

32
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:42,916
I gotta get going.

33
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,791
You two just go ahead and
get through the dungeon

34
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:46,708
on your own, and I'll
see ya soon, okay?

35
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:48,916
[LUCK laughs]

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,291
[ASTA] It's okay. We've got
nothin' to worry about.

37
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:52,708
Whatever traps are
in this place,

38
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:55,416
my sword'll slice
right through them, easy.

39
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,625
[NOELLE]
We're alone now.

40
00:01:56,708 --> 00:01:59,500
It's just the two of us.

41
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:00,916
What's up? Is something wrong?

42
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,416
Uh! No, of course not! Insect!

43
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,125
Well? Hurry!

44
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:09,958
[gasps]

45
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:12,041
Oh, no! It's a trap!

46
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:14,000
Gimme a sec!

47
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:15,750
[NARRATOR]
Asta and Noelle found themselves

48
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:18,375
in grave danger.
But just then...

49
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:19,458
Not good.

50
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:20,916
[ASTA]
Oh, crap!

51
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:32,833
Such powerful magic.

52
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:37,125
And precision, too.
But, whose spell was that?

53
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:43,916
[YUNO]
And with that, my debt is paid.

54
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,583
Asta.

55
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,166
Hey, Yuno!

56
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,375
[ALECDORA]
Captain Vangeance!

57
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:36,791
[WILLIAM]
Yes, Alecdora, what is it?

58
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:38,083
Sir.

59
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:40,000
I have some concerns
regarding the exploration

60
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:42,375
of the newly discovered dungeon.

61
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:45,625
Forgive me, but why
send an untried commoner

62
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,916
on such a crucial mission?

63
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,708
Do I have your trust
as your leader and captain?

64
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,166
[ALECDORA]
Yes, of course.

65
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,750
I would follow you anywhere,
do anything you asked.

66
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,666
Even should it mean my death.

67
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,875
I trust you.

68
00:04:57,958 --> 00:04:59,208
That's good.

69
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:01,458
I trust the "untried commoner,"
as you called him,

70
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:04,500
and I would ask you
to do the same.

71
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:06,500
After all, he is a
full-fledged member

72
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:08,000
of the Golden Dawn.

73
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:09,708
And for the sake of
the squad, I am certain

74
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:11,750
he will only continue
to grow stronger.

75
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,208
Sir.

76
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:19,166
[WILLIAM] Yes. Our new
member must grow stronger.

77
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,875
He must.

78
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:23,541
[ASTA chuckles]

79
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:29,125
[NOELLE]
So this is Yuno. And that's...

80
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:32,875
--Yuno.
--Sir.

81
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,208
[KLAUS]
Why did you go out of your way

82
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:35,666
to save these people?

83
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,541
We've been charged with
exploring this dungeon

84
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:39,583
and securing its
valuable contents.

85
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:41,833
Our primary objective is
to reach the treasure hall

86
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:43,916
at its heart with
all possible haste.

87
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,750
We have no time
to involve ourselves

88
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,291
with such rabble as these.

89
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:48,458
Jeez.

90
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:51,166
Who the hell is
Four-Eyes the Rude, here?

91
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,333
[YUNO]
My superior.

92
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:55,083
Excuse me?! And you
think that I'm rude?

93
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:57,291
Don't say that again, brat!

94
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,833
I am a noble, and you will
treat me with respect!

95
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:02,000
[YUNO] So much for not
involving ourselves.

96
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:07,000
Fancy running into
you here, Noelle.

97
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,250
Uh-huh...

98
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,291
We haven't seen each other
since last year's

99
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:12,708
royal banquet, isn't that right?

100
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:14,208
You know each other?

101
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,291
Yes, just a bit.

102
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,458
Actually, I'm Noelle's cousin.

103
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:19,666
[ASTA]
Uh-- Huh?

104
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,875
Well, this is quite a surprise.

105
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:23,541
[NOELLE]
It just had to be her.

106
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:25,041
From what I've heard,

107
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:27,833
the Black Bulls can be a rather
unrefined squad at times.

108
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:30,458
Are you doing
all right with them?

109
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:33,291
I think that's what I should
be asking you, Mimosa.

110
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:34,541
[MIMOSA]
Huh?

111
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,583
Can you actually keep up
with the elite members

112
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:38,916
of the Golden Dawn,
dim bulb that you are?

113
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,958
Sure!

114
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:42,416
Everyone is just
so incredibly kind.

115
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,541
I can wield my magic
with no qualms at all

116
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:47,458
knowing I have their support.

117
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,250
Oh! How thoughtless of me,

118
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,083
when you've always had
to struggle so much

119
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,375
with learning to
control your own magic.

120
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:55,458
Has that gotten any better?

121
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:58,166
[NOELLE] Clearly the girl
still doesn't have a filter.

122
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,958
Just fantastic.

123
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:02,833
Yes, it's coming
along fine, thank you.

124
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:05,041
Great! It's so wonderful
that we're both

125
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,000
finding our footing
as Magic Knights.

126
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:08,625
The Wizard King
even gave us a star

127
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:10,666
for our last mission!

128
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,166
[KLAUS]
Hmph.

129
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,250
[NOELLE, ASTA chuckle]

130
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:15,416
What a coincidence!

131
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,833
We got a star for
our last mission, too.

132
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:18,875
Huh.

133
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:20,666
You're a liar.

134
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,375
Brand-new members of
the slipshod Black Bulls?

135
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:27,000
It's inconceivable that you
could earn a star so easily.

136
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:28,041
Eh, heh...

137
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:29,916
Well, we did. So there!

138
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,416
And our total is up
to negative thirty now.

139
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,500
Ha! Not a chance.

140
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:37,333
Why, you're being sent on this
mission is absurd enough.

141
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:38,958
Guess the Wizard King
didn't think so,

142
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,458
'cause he's the one who sent me!

143
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:42,166
Yet another bald-faced lie.

144
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,041
It is <i>not</i> a lie!

145
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:45,291
[KLAUS]
Hah!

146
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:47,541
[YUNO]
Yeah, we're definitely involved.

147
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:48,958
Now that I think of it.

148
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:51,583
I was told that there were
going to be three of you.

149
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:53,208
So, where is your third member?

150
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:54,583
[BOTH]
Uh...

151
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:56,166
[KLAUS] What, did they
run away and leave you here

152
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:59,458
to explore the dungeon
on your own? Was that it?

153
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:03,125
Or perhaps they fell victim
to a trap spell? Hah!

154
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:04,541
[NOELLE]
He didn't run away,

155
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:06,333
and he didn't get
caught in some trap.

156
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:07,458
So where is he, then?

157
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:08,916
[ASTA, NOELLE]
Uh...

158
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:15,625
Almost there!

159
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:18,000
[ASTA]
He took off into the dungeon

160
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:19,500
because he's basically nuts?

161
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,625
[NOELLE]
Thanks, Luck.

162
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,041
Whatever the case,

163
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:25,833
he's a coward who left his
newest colleagues behind.

164
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:27,458
A typical Black Bull.

165
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:28,833
How disgusting.

166
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:31,125
Your whole squad brings
shame to the Magic Knights.

167
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:33,291
Okay, now you've
really done it, pal.

168
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:35,833
The Black Bulls are gonna
conquer this dungeon so fast,

169
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,083
you won't even
know what hit you!

170
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:41,083
Just you watch! Golden Dumb!

171
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:42,916
Uh, Golden Dim?

172
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,166
No, uh...

173
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,625
Squad with the
Weird-Haired Boss!

174
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:46,833
I've heard enough.

175
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:48,375
First you insult
our intelligence

176
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:50,000
and then our captain?

177
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:52,625
How dare you?!
Mocking our leader,

178
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:54,541
the incomparable
Captain Vangeance?

179
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:56,041
You will pay!

180
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:57,625
Besides, you're the
one whose captain

181
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,083
walks around in a ratty old top,

182
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:00,666
flaunting his
overinflated muscles

183
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,916
and smoking like a chimney!

184
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,458
What, are you crazy?

185
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:05,916
Or maybe you're just jealous
'cause Yami's manlier than you!

186
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,916
I am a senior Magic
Knight and a noble!

187
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,666
Show some respect, you filth!

188
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:14,041
Oh, begging your pardon,
sir. I'm <i>so sorry</i> !

189
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:15,375
Damn you!

190
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:18,750
[YUNO] "Involved" doesn't
even begin to cover it.

191
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:20,166
[KLAUS, ASTA panting]

192
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,416
All right, enough
of this idiocy.

193
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,750
I'll show you the
difference between

194
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:25,791
the top Magic Knight
squad in the kingdom

195
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,791
and the one that doesn't
deserve the name.

196
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:28,958
Mimosa!

197
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:30,416
Sure!

198
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,833
All right. Plant Creation Magic:

199
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:36,000
Magic Flower Guidepost.

200
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,375
[BOTH gasp]

201
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:49,208
[MIMOSA]
Let's see. Yes, yes, okay.

202
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:50,583
I've got the dungeon's layout.

203
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,750
I should be able to
find the treasure hall.

204
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,833
Good. Yuno?

205
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:55,958
[YUNO]
Yes, sir.

206
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,333
They all make it look so easy.

207
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,125
Do your best, poor as it is.

208
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,500
Good work, Yuno.

209
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:14,541
Yeah!

210
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:17,458
Let's go! You comin'?

211
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:19,750
Hey! Wait, no!

212
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,291
[YUNO, ASTA]
We'll fight to see

213
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,208
who will reach the
treasure hall first.

214
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:28,833
Whatever it takes!

215
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,833
Great! Now what do we do?

216
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:05,625
It's not as if either
of us are equipped

217
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,541
to use exploration
magic, you know!

218
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,791
We just check out every path

219
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:12,791
until we find the
right one. Let's do this!

220
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:14,041
What are you, insane?

221
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,166
Oh, yeah, that's right, you are.

222
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,666
This ingenious idea of yours

223
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,291
isn't going to get us
anywhere but lost.

224
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:24,666
[NOELLE]
Nero?

225
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:28,750
--[NOELLE gasps]
--[ASTA laughs]

226
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:31,541
[MIMOSA]
Next, we take a right.

227
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,000
[YUNO]
Okay.

228
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:35,583
That brat's name was Asta?

229
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:37,166
That little fool.

230
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:40,000
Does he honestly think he
can get the better of us?

231
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,458
He does seem a most unusual boy.

232
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:47,541
I sensed not a bit
of magic power in him.

233
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:49,708
No, neither did I.

234
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,875
[KLAUS] What was the
Black Bull captain thinking?

235
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:53,666
How could someone like
that be of any use

236
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:54,916
to a Magic Knight squad?

237
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,541
[YUNO]
Klaus, sir.

238
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:59,458
Asta's strong.

239
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:02,541
I would suggest not
underestimating him.

240
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:04,000
As far as I'm concerned,

241
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:07,041
it will be a miracle if they
make it out of here alive.

242
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,083
All we need to concentrate
on is capturing

243
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:12,083
this dungeon swiftly
for the good of our kingdom.

244
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:17,500
[MESSENGER 15A]
Reporting, Wizard King, sir.

245
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,666
[MESSENGER 15A]
Teams have been dispatched

246
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,875
by the Golden Dawn
and the Black Bulls.

247
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:25,666
They have begun their
exploration of the dungeon.

248
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,916
Also...

249
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,541
We have confirmed that
the Diamond Kingdom's

250
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:30,291
mage troops have
entered as well.

251
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,208
[OFFICIALS]
What?

252
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:32,541
[OFFICIAL 15A]
Diamond Kingdom!

253
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:33,791
[OFFICIAL 15C] They'd better
not get their hands

254
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:35,125
on the dungeon's treasure.

255
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:36,500
[OFFICIAL 15B] They've been
particularly focused

256
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:38,916
on expanding their
territory lately.

257
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
[OFFICIAL 15C]
They're always the aggressor.

258
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:43,375
[OFFICIAL 15D] If we let their
people take the ancient magic

259
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:44,791
from the dungeon, who knows

260
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:48,041
what kind of trouble
they'll cause?

261
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:49,916
These Diamond mage troops.

262
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,125
Who's their leader?

Sir!

264
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:54,000
The enemy troops appear
to be commanded

265
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:56,000
by Lotus of the Abyss.

266

--[JULIUS] Ah!
--[OFFICIALS murmuring]

267
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,500
[JULIUS] We met on the
battlefield once upon a time.

268
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:03,250
He was certainly tough. Crafty.

269
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,416
Uses the most
interesting magic, too.

270
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:09,083
Sir! This is no time
to be so nonchalant.

271
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:10,833
A graver tone, please?

272
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,916
All will be well, don't worry.

273
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,958
I believe Yami also sent
along someone interesting.

Still.

275
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,125
Lotus may be powerful, Marx,

276
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:21,291
but our young recruits...

277
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:23,208
They are, too.

278
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:24,875
Aw.

279
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,166
[LUCK]
You're all so weak.

280
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:34,958
But you're much stronger
than them, right?

281
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:38,000
Well. I don't know
about all that.

282
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,000
Don't like to
raise expectations.

283
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:42,500
It only leads to disappointment.

284
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:45,041
So much raw, young power.

285
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:48,125
I'm intimidated, to be honest.

286
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:51,375
You took out my underlings
with so little effort.

287
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:52,625
Truly impressive.

288
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:55,875
[laughs] Like you said,
they were underlings.

289
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,416
They can afford to
be weak so long as

290
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,208
their leader is powerful.

291
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:02,333
[LOTUS] I see that you fight
by surrounding yourself

292
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:06,125
with lightning magic.
How very resourceful of you.

293
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:08,833
Your attacks must
pack quite a punch.

294
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:10,250
You're fast, as well.

295
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:13,250
And all of that is fed
by your youthful vigor.

296
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:16,083
My, you've got this old
man scared, all right.

297
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:17,541
And what about you, then?

298
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:19,625
What magic do you fight with?

299
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,666
Goodness, you are an
eager one, aren't you?

300
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:27,375
[LOTUS] I'm assuming you
Clover folks came in search

301
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:29,958
of the dungeon's
treasure hall, too.

302
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:33,416
Yeah. Now, let's fight!

303
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,750
Oh, I don't know.

304
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,833
I mean, it's not like
we really need to fight.

305
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:39,583
We can just have a nice,
friendly footrace.

306
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,666
No violence or
bloodshed necessary.

307
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,916
What do ya think? It sounds
like a good idea to me.

308
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,916
Come on, let's go!

309
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,250
No way!

310
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:47,791
[LOTUS]
Fast, indeed.

311
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,166
[LUCK]
He dodged!

312
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,625
Smoke?

313
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,958
[LOTUS]
Oh. I'm terribly frightened.

314
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:58,500
Hm.

315
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:02,083
I can understand why your people
would be so angry with mine.

316
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:04,958
Obviously, no one likes
having their country invaded.

317
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:07,250
I don't blame you. Truly.

318
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:09,250
And we of the Diamond
Kingdom apologize

319
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:10,875
for the inconvenience.

320
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,291
It's just, we've found
ourselves running low

321
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:15,916
on resources, you know?

322
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,416

I actually had the dubious honor
of fighting your captain once.

something to confess.

The air in here's full
of my magic power.

Visible attacks can
only do so much.

399
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:41,000
They're easy enough for
an opponent to dodge.

400
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:42,958
I opted for a more
subtle approach.

401
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:45,416
So I used every last drop
of my magic power
