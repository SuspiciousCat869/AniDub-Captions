00:00:23,763 --> 00:00:25,682
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:25,765 --> 00:00:28,476
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:32,105 --> 00:00:34,441
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

00:00:34,524 --> 00:00:37,152
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:43,533 --> 00:00:45,577
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,789
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

[ASTA] Here we go!
Into to the Shadow Palace!

8
00:00:59,466 --> 00:01:01,259
[NARRATOR] In order to
save the souls of those

9
00:01:01,343 --> 00:01:03,511
who had reincarnated as elves,

10
00:01:03,595 --> 00:01:06,556
Asta and the others
stormed the Shadow Palace.

Hey there!

13
00:01:10,643 --> 00:01:11,603
[ASTA]
It's Rill!

14
00:01:11,686 --> 00:01:13,104
Here's an idea.

15
00:01:13,188 --> 00:01:16,149
How 'bout I wake
you up right now?

16
00:01:16,232 --> 00:01:17,942
[NARRATOR]
Inside the Shadow Palace,

17
00:01:18,026 --> 00:01:20,987
Asta and Mimosa
encountered Rill,

18
00:01:21,071 --> 00:01:22,572
while Noelle met Fana.

19
00:01:22,655 --> 00:01:23,823
You again?

20
00:01:23,907 --> 00:01:26,284
I don't understand this--
why are you here?

21
00:01:26,368 --> 00:01:28,995
I may be Fana, but I'm
a much different Fana

22
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:30,580
than the one you remember.

23
00:01:30,663 --> 00:01:32,290
[MEREOLEONA] I'm about to
teach you the importance

24
00:01:32,374 --> 00:01:35,251
of respecting your elders,
you mangy brat.

25
00:01:35,335 --> 00:01:37,629
[NARRATOR]
Mereoleona faced off with Vetto,

26
00:01:37,712 --> 00:01:40,090
and Fuegoleon with Kaiser.

27
00:01:40,173 --> 00:01:43,009
Both found themselves
in a heated battle.

28
00:01:44,928 --> 00:01:46,638
[KAISER]
Begone!

29
00:01:46,721 --> 00:01:49,683
You're mine, human!

30
00:01:52,102 --> 00:01:53,853

Not me.

31
00:01:53,937 --> 00:01:56,189
[FUEGOLEON]
I must prevail!

32
00:01:56,272 --> 00:01:59,275
[MEREOLEONA]
I have to be strong!

[NOELLE grunts]

39
00:04:27,173 --> 00:04:29,217
[NOELLE] I may not be
using my Valkyrie Armor

40
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,761
to its fullest potential yet,

41
00:04:31,845 --> 00:04:35,849
but I can still maneuver
better than she can.

42
00:04:35,932 --> 00:04:38,935
She must be Fana the Hateful
in her final form,

43
00:04:39,019 --> 00:04:40,603
the one who also possessed Fana

44
00:04:40,687 --> 00:04:45,233
of the Diamond Kingdom.
In that case...

45
00:04:45,316 --> 00:04:47,569
Up until this moment,
I've been afraid of using

46
00:04:47,652 --> 00:04:50,238
its full power,
focusing on control instead,

47
00:04:50,321 --> 00:04:52,282
and holding back in my strikes.

48
00:04:52,365 --> 00:04:54,993

Pretty neat, huh?

The forbidden magic
we used allows us to draw

00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:02,602
on the power of the other world
to cast supernatural spells.

This isn't good!

Apologies. I was getting
kinda sick of dying.

Charmy? Oh, no.

00:11:37,187 --> 00:11:41,941
[RILL] That's not it.
It just isn't right.

00:11:42,025 --> 00:11:44,069
This isn't what I want!

166
00:11:44,152 --> 00:11:45,945
I drew some monsters
because I thought

167
00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:48,281
they'd be a fitting
end to humanity.

I actually wanna draw
something prettier.

That's the truth.

I don't wanna create art
like this; it's so ugly.

This is all the humans'
fault! They did this!

Look at you, you're all upset.

00:12:05,632 --> 00:12:10,053
Maybe you're in a bad mood
'cause you're hungry. Ah?

[RILL] This seems familiar.
I've felt this magic before.

It means you were born

Then, you have characteristics
of both. You're a hybrid!

[YUNO] Mana Zone:
Spirit's Hushed Dance.

00:19:29,409 --> 00:19:30,827
What's this?

318
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:34,497
[PATRY] How did he manage
to evade all those attacks?

[RHYA]
In the time it took to get here,

321
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:42,380
he managed to
level up his power,

322
00:19:42,464 --> 00:19:46,051
both as a human and
as an elf. This kid.

323
00:19:46,134 --> 00:19:50,263
In terms of sheer talent,
he might surpass even Licht.

324
00:19:50,347 --> 00:19:51,681
[YUNO gasps]

325
00:19:53,183 --> 00:19:54,601
[YUNO] I don't understand
why my Mana Zone

326
00:19:54,684 --> 00:19:57,771
couldn't detect him.
It wasn't super speed.

327
00:19:57,854 --> 00:20:01,733
He just suddenly
appeared! Again!

328
00:20:01,816 --> 00:20:04,319
No. He made me move.

329
00:20:04,402 --> 00:20:07,197
He can forcibly change
someone's position,

330
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,616
even if he's only
touched them once!

331
00:20:24,506 --> 00:20:27,050
[YUNO] I don't know if
it's a magic stone or not,

332
00:20:27,133 --> 00:20:31,471
but that belongs to me.
Give it back!

333
00:20:31,554 --> 00:20:33,348
[RHYA]
Nice job, Ronne!

334
00:20:33,431 --> 00:20:35,475
I see you're still
as quick as always.

335
00:20:35,558 --> 00:20:37,394
No one could ever
beat you at tag.

336
00:20:37,477 --> 00:20:41,398
And, now, we can finally
make things right.

337
00:20:41,481 --> 00:20:43,400
Indeed.

338
00:20:50,407 --> 00:20:54,244
[RHYA]
I can tell when someone's lying.

339
00:20:54,327 --> 00:20:58,998
And I wonder why you told
a lie just now. Ronne?

340
00:20:59,082 --> 00:21:00,709
What's going on?

341
00:21:03,753 --> 00:21:06,006
[RHYA]
Who the hell are you?

342
00:21:08,049 --> 00:21:09,509
Huh?

343
00:21:11,761 --> 00:21:14,264
[growling]

344
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,393
[RHYA]
Don't tell me.

345
00:21:18,476 --> 00:21:21,396
This reincarnation...
It can't be.

[RHYA] "I Can Tell
When Someone's Lying."

348
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:09,212
You really can tell
when someone's lying,

349
00:23:09,295 --> 00:23:10,505
can't you, Rhya?

350
00:23:10,588 --> 00:23:13,383
Oh, yeah. Sure can spot a liar.

351
00:23:13,466 --> 00:23:16,553
[PATRY] So, if a liar told you
flat-out that they were a liar,

352
00:23:16,636 --> 00:23:18,513
you'd be able to figure out
if that's true or not.

353
00:23:18,596 --> 00:23:19,931
Have I got it right?

354
00:23:20,015 --> 00:23:21,558
[RHYA] Yeah. 'Cause I can
tell when someone's lying.

355
00:23:21,641 --> 00:23:23,727
I mean, if a liar is telling
you that they're lying,

356
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:26,104
they might honestly just be
telling you that they're lying,

357
00:23:26,187 --> 00:23:30,108
but it can be hard
to tell with a liar.

358
00:23:30,191 --> 00:23:32,318
But, like, they could be
lying about being a liar,

359
00:23:32,402 --> 00:23:33,778
which would mean
they're being honest,

360
00:23:33,862 --> 00:23:36,072
and honest people don't
typically lie about anything.

361
00:23:36,156 --> 00:23:37,949
So that would make them
a liar, wouldn't it?

362
00:23:38,033 --> 00:23:40,326
But liars wouldn't just come out
and say that they're liars.

363
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:41,536
They usually try to hide that,

364
00:23:41,619 --> 00:23:44,080
so that they can use it
to their advantage.

365
00:23:44,164 --> 00:23:45,415
So, um. I don't know.

366
00:23:45,498 --> 00:23:47,042
I've officially confused myself.

367
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:49,794
I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know. I don't know!

368
00:23:49,878 --> 00:23:52,505
This is a famous
paradox, you see.

369
00:23:52,589 --> 00:23:54,799
You all should think
about it, too.

370
00:23:56,843 --> 00:23:58,678
[RHYA]
That guy isn't Ronne.
