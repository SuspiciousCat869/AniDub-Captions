00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,666
[NARRATOR] Threatened
by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,416
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,666
[NARRATOR] All seemed
lost until a lone mage

4
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,166
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:35,666
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,833
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,083
[NARRATOR]
Vetto of the Third Eye

8
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,791
cast an ancient Hex upon Asta.

9
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:18,416
His Black Bull compatriots
have dedicated themselves

10
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,166
to finding a way
to heal Asta's arms.

11
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,458
For their part, Noelle
and Finral call upon

12
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:27,083
a certain man, hoping
he might have a lead.

13
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:28,666
We'd like to talk!

14
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,833
Sure.

15
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:30,916
I was just getting out
of the bath, so--

16
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,625
[NOELLE screams]

17
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:40,000
[NARRATOR] The man they'd come
to see was Fanzell Kruger.

18
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:41,416
But how could he help?

19
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,208
Who was this mysterious man,

20
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:46,333
and what possible connection
could he have to Asta?

21
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:49,166
Our story begins
five months earlier.

22
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:54,791
[NARRATOR] Asta and Yuno
had received their grimoires,

23
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,916
but they had not yet set out
for the Magic Knights

24
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,208
Entrance Exam in
the royal capital.

25
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:01,708
Asta was camping in the woods

26
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:04,625
near Hage Village, diligently
training with the sword

27
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,500
he had recently been given.

28
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:11,416

[yells]

30
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:18,083
Whoa...

31
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:21,333
I have no idea what
I'm doing... at all.

32
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:22,833
I mean, I've never
trained with a sword

33
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:24,583
before in my life.

34
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:26,958
I don't even know how
I'm supposed to hold it.

35
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:29,458
Does hacking at trees
really count as training?

36
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:31,166
[FANZELL screams]

37
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,333
If I were you, kid,

38
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:33,666
I would get outta
the way, and quickly!

39
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,750
Don't run right at me!

40
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,041
Hurry and jump to the side!

41
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:40,333
[panting]

42
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,875
Take that!

[BOAR 55A groans]

44
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:47,583
[FANZELL]
Very impressive.

45
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:51,000
You took out that big guy
in one blow. My mistake.

46
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:52,833
I was doin' some
fishing in the river,

47
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:56,708
and I guess I must've wandered
into the boar's territory.

48
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:58,375
Uh, yeah.

49
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:00,208
Anyway, name's Fanzell.

50
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:02,500
I'm something of
a nomad these days.

51
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:04,083
Nice to meet you.

52
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,500
[FANZELL]
Call me "Zell."

53
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:07,666
Okay, I'm Asta
from Hage Village.

54
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,250
[FANZELL]
It's a pleasure, Asta.

55
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,291
Now tell me, are those yours?

56
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:13,375
Yeah. Why do you wanna know?

57
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:16,666
[stomach growls]

58
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,833
So good! I thought
I was going to starve!

59
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:23,916
I haven't eaten
so much as a bite

60
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,416
in two whole days.
Never did catch any fish.

61
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:30,833
Awfully dense, aren't they?

62
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:33,291
It's amazing how they
just suck all the moisture

63
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:34,291
right out of your mouth.

64
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:35,541
Yeah, they do.

65
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:36,916
So, are you gonna tell me
why you're naked?

66
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,791
I didn't wanna get wet
while I was fishing.

67
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,333
What are these things?

68
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:44,375
You just ate them
without knowing?!

69
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:47,833
They're pop-potatoes,
a Hage Village specialty.

70
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:48,958
Cool.

71
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:52,708
Hey, are you okay?

72
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,458
--Here ya go!
--[FANZELL] Yes, please.

73
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:55,791
Thank you.

74
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,458
Ah!

75
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:02,291
What is this stuff?
It's got such a bitter taste.

76
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:04,541
It's my special moguro-leaf
juice for increasing

77
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:05,666
your magic power.

78
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,833
Well, I'm certainly
feeling better.

79
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,333
If you don't mind
coming to my house,

80
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:12,125
maybe I can find a way to
thank you for your help.

81
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:13,125
[ASTA]
Your house?

82
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:14,291
[FANZELL]
Well, to be honest,

83
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:17,166
I'm just kind of
squatting there.

84
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,833
[ASTA] I never knew there
were places this nice

85
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:20,666
way out in the woods!

86
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,541
Every now and then
you'll see one around.

87
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:26,583
Guess I should go ahead
and get some clothes on.

88
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:32,250
[FANZELL] Huh! A sword
that can nullify magic?

89
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,958
That's new to me.

90
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:36,041
It's new to me, too,
but this baby is what's

91
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:38,791
gonna get me through the
Magic Knights Entrance Exam.

92
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:41,333
That's why I've been holed up
here in the mountains training.

93
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:42,708
Yeah, that so?

94
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:45,333
What brings an old guy
like you up here, anyway?

95
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:47,041
"Old guy," huh?

96
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:50,541
I'm actually only 28,
thank you very much.

97
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:51,583
Twenty-eight?

98
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:55,041
No way! Wow!
You look so much older.

99
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:57,583
Right. Let's just
leave that there.

100
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:03,875
[FANZELL]
I'm waiting for someone.

101
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:06,000
[ASTA]
Kind of a weird meeting spot.

102
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:08,000
It's complicated.

103
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,875
[ASTA]
Okay.

104
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,333
So, tell me, Asta.

105
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:13,291
You're sleeping outside, right?

106
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:15,541
Why not stay with me while
you're training instead?

107
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,875
Really? That'd be
awesome, thanks.

108
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:20,541
Hold on, are you just
after my pop-potatoes?

109
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:22,833
Always treasure your
encounters and connections

110
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,166
with the people you meet.

111
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,333
True, they may not
have a concrete form,

112
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:28,666
but those experiences will
pile up in your heart

113
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,208
and keep you company.

114
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:34,750
Are you kidding me?

115
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,916
This guy's obviously
a total creep.

116
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,500
Are you actually going
to stay with him?

117
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,916
Okay! I think I'll
take you up on that.

118
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,666
Thanks a lot, Mister Zell.

119
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,875
[FANZELL] Great! Then let's
talk about chores.

120
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:48,125
How are you at choppin' wood?

121
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,875
[ASTA]
What?!

122
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:58,083
[ASTA grunting, yelling]

123
00:06:58,166 --> 00:06:59,833
[yelling]

124
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:05,583
Man, this doesn't seem
to be working at all.

125
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:07,333
[FANZELL] Well, maybe it's
because all your weight

126
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:08,416
is in your knees.

127
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,791
Huh?

128
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:11,333
[FANZELL] The problem you've
been having is that you

129
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:14,833
can't manage a second blow once
you swing your sword, right?

130
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:16,791
It throws off your balance.

131
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,208
Uh, yeah.

132
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:20,041
I know something that
might help with that:

133
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:22,833
keep your toes pointed in the
same direction as your sword,

134
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,250
then you take a
half-step forward

135
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:26,083
with your right foot
to shift your weight.

136
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:27,666
Go on, try.

137
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:32,666

[gasps, laughs]

140

Woo-hoo! I did it!

141
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,708
--I can't believe I actually...
--[FANZELL] Uh, yeah.

142
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:47,125
You did it. Picked it
up pretty fast, too.

143
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:48,458
That was impressive.

144
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:49,958
[ASTA]
That was amazing!

145
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:51,500
How'd you know that trick?

146
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:53,166
You fight with swords, too?

147
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:57,208
Well, no, not swords,
exactly. Hold on a sec.

148
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,541

Emperor of Slashing Winds.

Whoa! So cool!

152
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,208
You see, it's not a true sword,

153
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:24,666
but rather my magic
taking on the shape of one.

154
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,500
It's the Emperor
of Slashing Winds.

155

I call it "Slashy" for short.

156
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,500
You're awesome at
naming stuff, too!

157
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,416
Well, anyway, working
with this thing is

158
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,208
how I picked up a
little swordsmanship.

159
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:35,833
Hey, then you can teach me?!

160
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,583
I'm sure anything
you know will help.

161
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:38,500
I dunno.

162
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:40,500
Just a few lessons, that's all.

163
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,416
Please! I'll work hard!

164
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,625
Sure, no problem.

165
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:45,458
Huh?

166
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:46,916
Sounds good.

167
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,625
It does, really?

168
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:49,458
[FANZELL]
Mm-hm!

169
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,083
Awesome, thank you so much!

170
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:52,541
All right! Yes!

171
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:55,458
I've got a teacher! Oh, yeah!

172
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:58,208
Awesome. Awesome. So cool!

173
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:00,000
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

174
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,666
[FANZELL] However, there's
one thing I want you

175
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,125
to promise me in return.

176
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:07,416
Asta, why are you working
so hard to get stronger?

177
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,500
To become the Wizard King.

178
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:13,041
Ah. I see. Well, that's good.

179
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:14,958
Yes, it's very good.

180
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:16,333
Wait, you're not gonna laugh?

181
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:18,000
No. Why would I do that?

182
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,958
Because it's impossible
or whatever.

183
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,583
But how can you know
whether or not something

184
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:25,208
is impossible until
you've give it a try?

185
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,083
Listen closely.

186
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,250
I want you to make
me a promise, Asta.

187
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:30,958
That you'll only ever
use what I teach you

188
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:32,458
to make that dream come true.

189
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:34,875
Sure. What's that mean, though?

190
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:37,000
Just don't use what
you learn here for evil.

191
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,458
Use it to achieve your
goals, not as a tool

192
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,875
for harming the innocent
or bullying people.

193
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:45,083
I don't need anybody to tell
me not to do that stuff.

194
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:46,375
[FANZELL]
So, you promise?

195
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:48,791
[ASTA]
Yeah. I promise.

196
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:51,125
Okay. Then let's get to work.

197
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:53,958
Right! I'm ready
whenever you are!

198
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:05,208
[ASTA grunting, yelling]

199
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:10,416
No! You're too slow.

200
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,000
Don't pause between hits.

201
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:14,625
What we're after
is rapid-fire attack.

202
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:17,375
Right! [yells]

203
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,625
[FANZELL]
You really are fantastic, Asta.

204
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,583
Your defense and offense
are both solid,

205
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:24,000
and your footwork
is improving, too.

206
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,958
What I don't understand is,
if you're this strong,

207
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,125
then why didn't
you just take care

208
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:28,750
of that giant boar yourself?

209
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:31,125
Without either a sword
or my grimoire on me,

210
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:32,583
there wasn't a lot I could do.

211
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,291
And besides, my skills
with the sword

212
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,625
aren't anything
particularly advanced.

213
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:40,666
You just seem to be especially
good at putting them to use.

214
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,333
[ASTA]
I dunno.

215
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:43,708
I think it's because
you're especially good

216
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:44,875
at teaching them.

217
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:47,041
Heh! I did do some
teacher-y stuff

218
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:48,916
once upon a time, so maybe.

219
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,083
Oh, really?

220
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:51,583
The students that I
taught didn't think

221
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:54,166
very much of me, though. Ha, ha.

222
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,875
You know, I've had
more than 100 pupils,

223
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:58,625
but the way you're
progressing, you might rank

224
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,791
among the top three at least.

225
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:02,541
The top three?

226
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:04,208
Top two, maybe.

227
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:06,625
The highest ranked is kinda
out there, not even using

228
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:10,666
the sword as a sword, so I don't
know if that really counts.

229
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,125
Well, anyway.

230
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:14,666
Even if you are accepted
into a Magic Knight squad,

231
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:18,625
I think you'll turn out to be
a respectably skilled swordsman.

232
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,500
You really think so?

233
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:21,625
Then let's go.

234
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:23,666
We've got some more
training to do!

235
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,208
Whoa, not so fast!

236
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:27,375
We aren't even done eating yet.

237
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:33,375
[NARRATOR] Several more days
passed, until a visitor arrived.

238
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:37,166
I've returned, Master.

239
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,041
Sorry it took so long.

240
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,375
Who's that?

241
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:43,125
You're back! So, what did
you find out, Mariella?

242
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:45,416
[ASTA]
"Mariella"?

243
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,833
[FANZELL] One of my pupils.
She's helping me.

244
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,333
I've asked her to
track down my fiancée.

245
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:53,166
That girl's your student?

246
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,250
If you need to find your
fiancée, wouldn't it be better

247
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:57,833
just to go out and
look for her yourself?

248
00:11:57,916 --> 00:12:00,500
The full explanation
is a bit complicated,

249
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:03,541
but I can't draw attention
to myself right now.

250
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,500
I'm Asta from Hage Village.

251
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:10,958
The old man here's teaching
me how to use the sword.

252
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:13,333
Nice to meetcha.

253
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:15,666
Please, this is no
ordinary "old man."

254
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,375
While it might be
true that he's old,

255
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:19,708
he is an amazing old man. So...

256
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:22,125
--[MARIELLA] Look...
--[FANZELL] But I'm... not old.

257
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,541
...he is not the kind of old man

258
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,666
that you can casually
refer to as "old man."

259
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,708
There are rules to follow
for this sort of thing.

260
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:30,583
--Like I told you...
--[FANZELL] I'm 28.

261
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:31,791
...and I don't see
what's so wrong

262
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,708
about calling an
old man "old man."

263
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,708
It's a simple matter
of perception.

264
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:37,833
If you truly realized
how amazing he was,

265
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:39,250
you would be addressing
him with the proper

266
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:40,958
amount of respect and deference.

267
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:42,750
But when you say "old man,"
it doesn't sound

268
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:45,041
the least bit
respectful or deferential.

269
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:46,958
How am I supposed to make
the words "old man"

270
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:48,125
sound respectful?

271
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:50,000
Maybe we could just
let it go now, huh?

272
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,541
Listening to you two bicker
isn't exactly doing wonders

273
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:55,458
for my self-esteem.

274
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:58,416
So, what about Dominante?

275
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,625
Where is she?

276
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:01,500
Forgive me, Master.

277
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:04,000
I don't know how
to say this, but...

278
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:07,041
I believe it's possible that
Domina has passed away.

279
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:09,166
[gasps]

280
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,166
Oh, no.

281
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:15,333
[NARRATOR] And so, Fanzell
shared his story with Asta.

282
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,958
Fanzell and his fiancée
Dominante had been members

283
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:20,750
of the Diamond Kingdom's army.

284
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,833
No longer able to
stomach the army's

285
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:26,250
extreme methods, the couple
plotted to desert but wound up

286
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:29,583
separated as they sought to
escape the kingdom's assassin.

287
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:31,541
Desperate to find his fiancée,

288
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:34,041
Fanzell asked his former
pupil and fellow deserter,

289
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:37,750
Mariella, to search for
her while he laid low.

290
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,708
Fanzell knew that
when he made a move,

291
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,541
the killer would, too.

292
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:43,625
Not wanting to endanger
Domina if she were

293
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:46,458
in hiding nearby, he was
forced to go to ground

294
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:48,541
in an abandoned house.

295
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:51,291
[ASTA]
Wow.

296
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:53,458
[MARIELLA]
Here's Domina's wand.

297
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,750
It was found where the assassin

298
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,208
was thought to
have attacked her.

299
00:13:57,291 --> 00:14:00,791
That, and a great deal of blood.

300
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,333
[FANZELL]
I see.

301
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:05,750
If you'll excuse me, I need
a moment to myself now.

302
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:25,541
[knocking]

303
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:28,333
Master. Pardon me.

304
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,041
[MARIELLA]
I'm sorry, but...

305
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:35,708
There's something I need
to talk to you about.

306
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:38,708
Back when you helped me and
the other students escape.

307
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:41,083
Do you remember?

308
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:45,583
[FANZELL] Yeah. How's
everyone doing these days?

309
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:49,333
Oh, wow. That actually
got a smile out of you.

310
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:51,708
You know, it's funny
that you ask,

311
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,958
because everyone else
but me is dead.

312
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:55,125
Huh?

313
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:02,541
They were murdered by the
Diamond Kingdom's assassain.

314
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:04,708
Every last one of them.

315
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:12,375
What the hell are you doing?

316
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:13,708
This is my job now.

317
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:15,666
I do the kingdom's
dirty work, provide it with

its defectors when necessary.

If I hadn't agreed to
cooperate with them,

320
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:24,833
then I would be as dead
as the others are now.

321
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:25,833
Don't worry, though--

322
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:27,500
we aren't going
to kill you here.

323
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:29,250

And in case you're thinking
of trying to escape,

00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:35,458

The boy has a name,
and it's Mars.

he's some kind of weapon.

Aren't you grateful for what
the old man's done for you?

00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:11,250
Yes, I am.

341
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,666
I recognize that the combat
techniques he taught me

342
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,916
when I was his student are
what's helped to keep me alive,

343
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,833
and for that, he still
has my respect.

344
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:19,875
If he didn't, why would
I ever be concerned

345
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:21,583
with the way in which
you address him?

346
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:24,166
But then why would you
do something like this?

347
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,833
[MARIELLA]
If I fixated on those details,

348
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:29,250
I could never get my job done.

349

So would you kindly
not interfere?

I doubt you want to die for
an old man you don't know.

351
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:37,916
I'd say that I know him
pretty well by now!

No, Asta. Please just

You said you'd only ever
use what I taught you

00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,666
about the sword to
achieve your dream.

357

You shouldn't use your
skills here in defense

358

so get going!

I mean it, run!

Hey, don't worry about it.

I may be old, but I
can still handle

these goons without your help.

You're already wounded!

I'll make my own promise:
I swear not to die

at the hands of
these Diamond mages.

368

I'm gonna hold you to it.

you understand me?

No reason to go on.
I'm so very tired of all this.

I'm done running.

no matter how long it takes.

445
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,750
When I finally have her,
I'll try to find a way to atone

446
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:49,166
for all the harm
I've done in my life.

I haven't figured
out exactly how

I'll manage that yet,
but considering my past,

it'll probably take many years.

be dying anytime soon.

last lesson for you.

476
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,208
Take this monster down, will ya?

477
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:03,416
No way! You can do it yourself!

478
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,041
And why are you naked this time?

479
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:06,750
Don't tell me you
were fishing again!

480
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:09,166
[FANZELL]
I'll explain later, just help!

481
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,500
[ASTA]
Stay away from me!

482
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,458
[FANZELL]
Where are you, my Domina?

483
00:23:48,541 --> 00:23:50,375
I know you're still
alive somewhere.

484
00:23:50,458 --> 00:23:52,666
Uh, excuse me, miss, uh,
can I ask you something?

485
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,583
Wait, please don't run away!

486

"The Man Named
Fanzell, Continued."

488
00:23:58,458 --> 00:24:00,875
Just ignore the fact
that I'm naked.
