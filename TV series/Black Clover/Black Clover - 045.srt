1
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:15,666
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,500
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:24,625
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:27,166
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:35,791
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:39,833
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:43,458
[NARRATOR] Vetto's sudden
appearance shocked

8
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:46,791
the Black Bulls and
temple mages alike.

9
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:51,375
Water Creation Magic:
Now, Poseidon's Hammer!

10
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:53,416
--[MAGNA] Nice!
--[LUCK] Whoa!

11
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,500
[GIO gasps]

12
00:00:54,583 --> 00:00:56,500
That little hammer
spell is no match

13
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:58,333
for my Rhinoceros Armor.

14
00:00:58,416 --> 00:01:00,375
[GIO]
There's not a scratch on him!

15
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:02,750
[VETTO laughs]

16
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:05,083
Still, not a bad try
for a temple mouse.

17
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:06,541
You've earned a prize.

18
00:01:06,625 --> 00:01:09,083
My Beast Magic: Bear Claw!

19
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:10,375
[GIO grunts]

20
00:01:10,458 --> 00:01:11,208
[BOTH gasp]

21
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:13,000
[VETTO]
You are insects.

22
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:16,541
I shall not allow you to
retain even a shred of hope.

23
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:21,500
[YAMI]
Dark Magic: Lightless Slash!

24
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:27,750
Huh? What is this?

25
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:29,458
All right, ya morons. Listen up!

26
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:30,791
[GREY]
Oh, my gosh!

27
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:33,291
[YAMI] A nasty character's
just crashed the party.

28
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:36,750
But some... things have come up,
so I can't get to 'em.

29
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:38,958
You block heads are
gonna hafta handle it.

30
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:41,708
Now look. It's time
to get serious.

31
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:43,250
Push past yer limits.

32
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:45,375
[NARRATOR] It seemed the fate
of the Underwater Temple

33
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:48,500
was in the Black Bulls'
hands. And then...

34
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:50,416
[MAGNA, LUCK]
Now! We won't give up!

35
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,250
We're gonna fight with
everything we've got!

36
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:55,041
Combo Spell:

37
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:58,916
Flame Lightning
Exploding Cannon!

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,083
[MAGNA, LUCK yell]

39
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:14,833
[KIATO] Your friends
are a lot more powerful

40
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:16,500
than I expected.

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,291
Oh, man.

42
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:33,750
[ASTA gasps]

43
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:41,333
[VETTO laughs]

44
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:51,583
That Combo Spell was
unbelievably powerful,

45
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:54,625
and he survived it
without a scratch on him.

46
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:59,208
[YAMI] Magna, Luck, that
was a real manly effort.

47
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:03,166
All right, kid.
Stand your ground!

48
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:38,000
[VETTO]
You pathetic weaklings.

49
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:41,333
I gave you a chance, and
that was all you could do?

50
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:43,666
Accept your despair.

51
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:50,541
[VETTO] Ah, the puny knight
with the anti-magic sword.

52
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:53,916
We meet again, brat.

53
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,333
It's one of them.

54
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:57,458
The Eye of the Midnight Sun!

55
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:59,791
This is a stroke of luck.

56
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:01,708
Since you're here,
I can repay you

57
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:04,875
for all the pain
you caused Licht.

58
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:08,666
You'll wind up just like
these insects at my feet.

59
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,833
[ASTA]
They're <i>not</i> insects.

60
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:14,541
They're my superiors!

61
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:15,708
[VETTO grunts]

62
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:20,125
Listen! Their job
was to take you down.

63
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:22,375
And now that job
has passed to me.

64
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:25,000
[VETTO] So this scratch
is the result of a blow

65
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:26,875
from an anti-magic sword.

66
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,916
To be fair, if it had
been anybody else,

67
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,833
it would've sliced
right through.

68
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:32,416
And it accomplished
more than those

69
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,916
other mages' special combo move.

70
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,875
Yeah, well, that's
just the beginning!

71
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,875
Now, let's talk about
those magic stones

72
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:40,583
you people want so bad.

73
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:43,166
That's right, we know
what you're after!

74
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,666
I don't have to tell
you anything, runt.

75
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,458
You're just garbage to me.

76
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:49,625
A piece of trash
unloved by mana.

77
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:51,083
I'm garbage, huh?

78
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,458
Now come on, take
another swipe at me.

79
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:57,250
You won't fare any better
than your feeble friends did.

80
00:05:57,333 --> 00:06:00,500
This beast man
even took out Dad?

81
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,250
His power reserves
are like nothing

82
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:03,916
I've ever seen before.

83
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,583
He's surrounded by
waves of magic,

84
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:08,000
his body constantly
guarded by them.

85
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:11,000
[VETTO]
These fools.

86
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:13,583
I'll have plenty of time
to look for the magic stone

87
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:16,750
after I massacre every
last person here.

88
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:19,416
That goes for the
people outside, too.

89
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,250
I can only hope such
pitiful specimens will be

90
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,875
sufficiently amusing to destroy.

91
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:27,291
[KIATO growls]

92
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:30,583
[KIATO] My family lives here.
My friends live here.

93
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:33,458
I love them all, and I
won't let you kill them!

94
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,166
[growls]

95
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,583
Ready, Kiato?

96
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:40,458
--[KIATO] Yeah!
--[ASTA yells]

97
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:46,958
[VETTO yells]

98
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:48,833
[yells]

99
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,458
[VETTO yells]

100
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:56,083
[BOTH panting

101
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,833
Such power, and he
barely touched us!

102
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:02,166
[ASTA] The way he's attacking...
Is he reading our ki?

103
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,125
He's so fast, reading
his is almost pointless.

104
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,791
Wow, that was awesome.

105
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:10,000
I didn't realize how powerful
your Dance Magic was

106
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,166
when we were fighting earlier.

107
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,291
You must've been
really holding back.

108
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:13,625
And so were you.

109
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:15,625
I didn't know that you
had a second sword.

110
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:20,250
How tedious. Sluggish
moves, glancing blows.

111
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:22,666
But what should I expect
from magicless trash

112
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,750
and underwater scum?
You're pathetic.

113
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:29,666
Hm. Now you're askin' for it,
you overgrown furball.

114
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,041
[BOTH]
We'll do whatever we have to,

115
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:32,458
to bring you down!

116
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:34,708
[ASTA, KIATO yell]

117
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:37,541
That's my boy, Kiato!

118
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:40,083
Give that beastman
everything that you've got!

119
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:41,416
[YAMI]
Look at that kid.

120
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,250
Still actin' like
nothin' scares him.

121
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:49,125
[VANESSA] Even from here,
I can feel the magic.

122
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:51,791
The air is practically
on fire with it.

123
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,166
[YAMI] Now, look.
It's time to get serious.

124
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,750
Push past your limits.

125
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,583
All right, Captain.

126
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:03,833
I guess you mean
business. Too bad.

127
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:06,458
I'll have to put the
wine away for now.

128
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,250
[FINRAL] This is getting
worse by the second.

129
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:15,875
If I run into that monster and
try to fight him, he'll kill me.

130
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:18,416
But... if I run off
and hide somewhere,

131
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,583
like I want to do,
Yami'll kill me.

132
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:25,458
What do I do?!

133
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:29,791
I'll take the flan. A bucketful.

134
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:33,583
Yummy. So much flan.

135
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:36,625
Tch. Damn it.

136
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:38,250
I was trying to get
this over with quickly

137
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,791
so I could go see Marie.

138
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:43,750
This delay is
absolutely unacceptable.

139
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:51,333
[ZARIK laughs] Hello, Magic
Knight. You're in for it now.

140
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:53,625
Unfortunately, you're about
to be pitted against

141
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:56,791
the Eye of the Midnight
Sun's top Chain Mage.

142
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,583
Whoever this Marie is,
I'll make sure

143
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:00,375
you never see her again.

144
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:02,083
Making a threat like
that is a good way

145
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,375
to end up dead.

146
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:04,375
That's it.

147
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:07,791
Mirror Magic: Reflect Refrai--

148
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:09,291
[ZARIK]
Nice try.

149
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,083
But my chain magic immediately
senses when attack spells

150
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,000
have been cast
and counters them.

151
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:17,125
Chain Magic: Scorpio Chain!

152
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:22,791
[laughs]

153
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:24,458
Come on, move faster!

154
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:28,000
At this rate, you're not
going to last very long.

155
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:29,541
You think pretty
highly of yourself

156
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:30,916
for a damn minion.

157
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,541
Mirror Magic: Real Double!

158
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:37,500
Oh, no, whatever shall I do?

159
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:40,666
With an extra target, my one
chain can't possibly keep up.

160
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,125
It's a good thing I've got two.

161
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,791
[BOTH]
In that case...

162
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,791
Reflect Refrain!

163
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:47,958
Whoa, hey.

164
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:49,500
What're you gonna
do with those things?

165
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:50,750
[GAUCHES]
Die.

166
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,666
I told you what threats
like that would get you.

167
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:01,750
[GAUCHE groans]

168
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:06,000
[ZARIK laughs]

169
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:09,041
Phew! You had me worried
for a second there.

170
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:10,875
You irritate me.

171
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:14,166
Now, Chain Magic: Heavy Chain!

172
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:17,750
[ZARIK]
To pay you back,

173
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:20,625
these lovelies will
crush you into nothing!

174
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:21,833
[gasps]

175
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:32,083
[grunts]

176
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:33,791
Damn he's fast.

177
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:41,000
[ZARIK laughs] There's no use
running away, weakling.

178
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:42,250
[GAUCHE]
Dammit.

179
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:43,958
He looks and talks like
an idiot, so I thought

180
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:46,541
he'd be easy to deal with,
but he's strong.

181
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:48,125
[gasps]

182
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:49,708
[ZARIK laughs]

183
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:02,000
[ZARIK]
So, where are you hiding now?

184
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:05,500
[GAUCHE panting]

185
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:07,208
[GAUCHE]
I hate to say it, but his magic

186
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:10,333
is solid on both
attack and defense.

187
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:14,541
If there's any opening here,
it's with the caster himself.

188
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:18,000
He's underestimating me,
letting his guard down.

189
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:20,791
But I've already played
my Real Double card.

190
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,833
So what now?

191
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:25,916
Huh?

192
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,041
[ZARIK] Come out, come out,
wherever you are!

193
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,166
I can tell you're
a Black Bull just from

194
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,458
the pathetic resistance
you're putting up.

195
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:40,291
Your squad is
a bunch of pitiful,

196
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:41,375
cowardly little misfits.

197
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:42,541
[GAUCHE]
Shut your mouth.

198
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:43,708
Dumb-looking jerk!

199
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:45,250
There you are!

200
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:50,208
[GAUCHES grunt]

201
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:57,125
Thought you could play the
same trick twice, didja?

202
00:11:57,208 --> 00:12:01,375
[yelps] So scary! Save me!

203
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:03,166
Your brilliant plan failed.

204
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,875
Ya idiot. And now you'll die.

205
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,125
You're the idiot here.

206
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:09,416
There's another one?

207
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,208
Now, Mirror Magic:
Large Reflect Ray!

208
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:16,375
[ZARIK yelps]

209
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:21,916
[ZARIK] But, how? I already
defeated your clone.

210
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,041
Well, too bad for you.
That wasn't my clone.

211
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:30,291
Yeah, ya dummy! You fell
for it! You fell for it!

212
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,083
I used my Transformation
Magic to trick you

213
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:34,750
by turning into Gauche,
and it totally worked!

214
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,416
[GAUCHE]
He was a tough opponent.

215
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,666
Too tough. It's a good
thing Grey showed up.

216
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,291
So thank me already!

217
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:46,791
[laughs]

218
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,666
Quit acting like a freak while
you look like me! Or die.

219
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:56,458
[GAUCHE] I don't have as much
power left as I'd like.

220
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:59,625
But we still have to defeat
the remaining enemies.

221
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:00,708
Yes, sir!

222
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:01,875
Ah...

223
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:04,125
[GAUCHE]
Hm?

224
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:06,875
[GREY]
I'm so super sorry about this!

225
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:09,041
Guess I twisted my ankle.

226
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:10,750
This is ridiculous.

227
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,500
At least change into
something that isn't me!

228
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:16,833
I know. A crab, they
have plenty of legs.

229
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:20,541
Oh, no! If I transform so soon,
it would use up magic power.

230
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,458
Can't waste that, can we?

231
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:24,333
[gasps]

232
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:25,291
[GREY]
Hold on.

233
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,458
[GAUCHE]
Why?

234
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,500
[GREY] I'm sure it was
right around here.

235
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:30,833
Aha! Thataway!

236
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:32,458
[CHARMY]
Who needs a fork?

237
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:35,541
The best way to eat cake
is with your hands.

238
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:38,333
[GAUCHE] Domehead!
Why the hell's she sleeping?

239
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:41,708
[GREY] Dunno. She was like
that when I found her.

240
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:43,500
Even that greedy glutton
could be a help

241
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:45,291
against the Eye of
the Midnight Sun.

242
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:46,666
Let's wake her up.

243
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:49,916
[GAUCHE gasps]

244
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:55,333
What? Oh, no! We're gonna die!

245
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:57,250
[sighs]

246
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:59,625
[GAUCHE] These vines are
draining away my magic power!

247
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:02,750
[GREY] Ah! I'm getting
weaker by the second!

248
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:06,083
[ZUTA]
My Vine Trap Magic: Bind Vine.

249
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:08,333
--[GREY yelps]
--[ZUTA] Two identical faces.

250
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:10,500
Someone's using
transformation magic.

251
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:11,791
You bastard.

252
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:13,875
[GREY] Oh, no, oh, no,
oh, no! Another one!

253
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:15,583
Heh. Well, lucky me!

254
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:17,958
Two of you knights
for the price of one!

255
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,375
It won't be long now
before my Vine Magic

256
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:24,916
renders you just as useless
as this poor fellow here.

257
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,083
[GREY] No, stop!
Please, don't! Let us go!

258
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:31,333
[ZUTA]
My goodness. How easy.

259
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:33,833
Simply cast my Trap Magic,
and let you dimwits

260
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:36,833
wander blindly into them
with no help from me.

261
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:38,000
That's it.

262
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:40,541
I just wait until you're
drained of power.

263
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,375
And then you're all mine.

264
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,416
Couldn't be more effortless.

265
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,541
[GAUCHE]
Damn. He's got my grimoire, too.

266
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:49,875
I can't produce any mirrors.

267
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:52,750
Was he using her as bait?

268
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:55,000
[GAUCHE]
Hey, Fivehead! Wake up!

269
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:58,041
Another bowl?
Don't mind if I do...

270
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:02,250
[GAUCHE] We're trapped here,
and she's taking a catnap!

271
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:05,208
[GREY]
No! Let go! Please! Stop!

272
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:06,541
I don't wanna die!

273
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:08,000
[GAUCHE]
Even if we could fight back,

274
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:11,416
this one can only use
Transformation Magic.

275
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,583
Useless, both of them!

276
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:16,791
I'll just have to do something
before I run out of magic.

277
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,625
All by myself.

278
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,791
We're squadmates and
friends, aren't we?

279
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:21,958
And that means when we fight,

280
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:24,083
I protect you and
you protect me!

281
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:27,916
Then nobody can take
either of us down!

282
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,958
[GAUCHE]
That's right.

283
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:31,458
I can't forget what I
learned on that mission.

284
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,333
[GREY] Gauche, this jerk
is stealing my magic power

285
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:34,583
and I'll never get it back!

286
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:35,750
Why are you just hanging there?

287
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,916
Do something already
or we're gonna die!

288
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,166
[GAUCHE]
Will you shut up?

289
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:43,791
[GAUCHE]
Think. How do we fight this guy?

290
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:46,333
I've got a chameleon
with zero offense,

291
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:48,750
and a bottomless pit
who's dead to the world.

292
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,541
Oh, yeah, there's
nothing I like better

293
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:53,291
than a big ol' hunk of meat.

294
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,000
[GAUCHE]
Hey, Grey!

295
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,541
I have an idea.

296
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,750
[ZUTA laughs]
You don't stand a chance.

297
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,833
I doubt you could have
defeated me before,

298
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:03,583
and now that my vines
have drained away

299
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:04,750
more than half your power,

300
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:07,125
you're even less equipped
to challenge me.

301
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:10,208
You know what? I gotta admit,
I'm kinda impressed.

302
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:12,291
You're pretty strong
for an old man.

303
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:15,333
What?! I'll have you
know, I'm only 20!

304
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:17,833
There's no time to
hesitate. Let's do this!

305
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:19,708
Okay, here goes!

306
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:26,250
[ZUTA]
What is that?

307
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,291
Hey, domehead, wake up!

308
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:30,708
Somebody's trying to
steal your dinner!

309
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:33,583
What are you gonna do about it?

310
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:34,875
What would I want
with that thing?

311
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:36,416
I don't even eat meat.

312
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:40,833
[CHARMY]
You. Step away from the food.

313
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,000
[ZUTA]
Huh?

314
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:46,166
Such power from
someone so small?

315
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:51,291
[ZUTA]
On the inside, she's a beast!

316
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:55,083
All right. I'll just suck away
your magic power, too.

when she actually focuses,

328
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:36,458
her attacks are unreal.

And you. You can do a lot
more than I thought.

Huh?

You aren't the first

with the power to
transform themselves.

00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:46,291
But that rock--I've
never known anybody

who could transform
objects, too.

335
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:54,166
Seems like you could maybe
do a bit more with it.

Well... What?

I used more magic
than I realized!

My transformation's breaking up.

I wonder what it'll look like.

Oh, my gosh, how
could this happen?

349
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:28,000
It's even worse than those
creepy vine things!

I'm so embarrassed!
Don't look at me, please!

00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,291
Why would I look at
you when I can gaze

352
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:34,166
upon the face of
my angel, Marie?

The sight of her face
will restore my strength.

even a little interested?

Wow, so that's
what you look like.

Not what I expected.

I hate letting anyone
see my real self.

Aw, c'mon, what's the matter?

You're so cute. Stop. Now.

I've always wanted to ask:
how old are you, really?

Um. I'm 24.

Huh?! You're five years
older than me? No way!

I simply refuse to
believe that you and I

are the same age, glutton.

You had some hope left?

An attack like that
is child's play to me.

You'll have to do a lot better.

Fighting with objects you
aren't even worthy to touch.

You don't have so much
as a sliver of hope.

And do you know why?

384
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:06,833
One, you're weak to
long-distance attacks,

385

such as throws.

Especially when it comes
to non-magical objects.

Two, you're physically strong,

but still outmatched by
one whose strength

389
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,458
has been magically enhanced.

You think if you
hang on long enough,

395
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:33,583
you're bound to find some way

396
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:36,041
of turning the fight
in your favor.

397
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:38,666
So you persist in
your reckless attacks
