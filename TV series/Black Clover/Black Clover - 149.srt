1
00:00:22,303 --> 00:00:23,888
[NARRATOR]
The Clover Kingdom.

2
00:00:23,972 --> 00:00:26,516
In this place where
magic is everything,

3
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:29,436
there lives a magicless
boy named Asta.

4
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,313
This brave young hero devotes
blood, sweat, and tears

5
00:00:32,397 --> 00:00:34,482
to becoming the
next Wizard King.

6
00:00:34,566 --> 00:00:37,902
Though Asta's situation
is practically unheard of,

7
00:00:37,986 --> 00:00:39,863
there are others
residing in this kingdom

8
00:00:39,946 --> 00:00:42,532
who possess at least
a tiny amount of mana,

9
00:00:42,615 --> 00:00:45,035
yet can barely
use spells at all.

10
00:00:45,118 --> 00:00:47,746
They make up a very
small minority,

11
00:00:47,829 --> 00:00:50,415
living their lives
in the shadows.

12
00:00:53,752 --> 00:00:56,629
[NARRATOR]
But, like everyone else,

13
00:00:56,713 --> 00:00:59,132
they do their best to survive.

14
00:01:10,727 --> 00:01:11,686
[SECREÉ]
My prince.

15
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:13,772
I've prepared your tea.

16
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,861
All right.

17
00:01:30,205 --> 00:01:31,998
[SECREÉ]
I'm sure it's cold by now.

18
00:01:32,082 --> 00:01:34,292
[gasps]

19
00:01:34,376 --> 00:01:36,169
[LUMIERE]
Secré! How long were you there?

20
00:01:36,252 --> 00:01:38,546
How long do you
think, my prince?

21
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:40,674
Sorry. I didn't see you.

22
00:01:40,757 --> 00:01:42,258
[SECREÉ]
It's not a problem.

23
00:01:42,342 --> 00:01:43,426
I'm used to it.

24
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:45,136
Why don't you take a look?

25
00:01:48,515 --> 00:01:50,975
A magic item that allows
mana to be stored up

26
00:01:51,059 --> 00:01:53,687
and distributed; that's
quite an interesting idea.

27
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:56,064
It'll help increase
overall mana output!

28
00:01:56,147 --> 00:01:58,566
Just like the elves'
magic stones can do.

29
00:01:58,650 --> 00:01:59,609
Oh.

30
00:01:59,693 --> 00:02:01,236
You see, there's
a small population

31
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:03,071
in the Clover Kingdom
who weren't blessed

32
00:02:03,154 --> 00:02:05,240
with much magic power.

33
00:02:05,323 --> 00:02:07,117
But once this
device is completed,

34
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,994
we'll be able to easily
solve that problem for them.

35
00:02:10,078 --> 00:02:11,121
[gasps]

36
00:02:11,204 --> 00:02:12,288
Yes!

37
00:02:12,372 --> 00:02:14,082
Perhaps this will stop
the discrimination

38
00:02:14,165 --> 00:02:17,043
all those people
face. I hope so!

39
00:02:18,461 --> 00:02:21,339
[LUMIERE] Unfortunately,
there are other issues

40
00:02:21,423 --> 00:02:22,841
I'll have to fix first.

41
00:02:22,924 --> 00:02:25,552
Oh, boy. Makes my head spin!

42
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,391
[SECREÉ] My prince thought about
the future of this kingdom

43
00:02:31,474 --> 00:02:33,977
more than anyone else I knew.

44
00:02:36,187 --> 00:02:38,023
[SECREÉ]
Still...

45
00:02:38,106 --> 00:02:39,983
[DAZU] I'm sure the burn
scar that I got from him

46
00:02:40,066 --> 00:02:42,235
will fade as time goes by.

47
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:47,449
But, the scars on my heart from
enduring years of ridicule...

48
00:02:47,532 --> 00:02:49,951
I'll probably have
those for life.

49
00:02:50,035 --> 00:02:53,038
More than that,
even now that they're dead,

50
00:02:53,121 --> 00:02:55,415
the flames of vengeance
that engulf my soul

51
00:02:55,498 --> 00:02:56,750
will burn forever.

52
00:02:56,833 --> 00:03:00,462
We must reach the
Spade Kingdom at any cost,

53
00:03:00,545 --> 00:03:04,466
so that we can obtain
the devil's power.

54
00:03:04,549 --> 00:03:06,593
[SECREÉ] The reason
that woman craved revenge

55
00:03:06,676 --> 00:03:08,762
and started this rebellion

56
00:03:08,845 --> 00:03:11,306
was because she suffered
the same discrimination

57
00:03:11,389 --> 00:03:13,892
he was talking about back then.

58
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,354
[SECREÉ]
It may have been 500 years,

59
00:03:17,437 --> 00:03:18,730
but I'm starting to realize

60
00:03:18,813 --> 00:03:21,900
that this kingdom hasn't
changed much at all.

61
00:04:52,824 --> 00:04:56,327
[JULIUS] I'm sure you know
why I've called you here.

62
00:04:56,411 --> 00:04:58,163
I was hoping to ask
you a few questions

63
00:04:58,246 --> 00:05:01,249
about what happened
with the Devil Believers.

64
00:05:01,332 --> 00:05:03,209
Sure, we'll tell you anything.

65
00:05:03,293 --> 00:05:04,544
You do it.

66
00:05:04,627 --> 00:05:06,046
[ASTA]
Yeah, okay!

67
00:05:06,129 --> 00:05:07,297
Thank you.

68
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,924
If you all are ready,
let's get started now.

69
00:05:10,008 --> 00:05:13,136
I heard you had a chance
to speak with their leader.

70
00:05:13,219 --> 00:05:15,680
Can you tell me more
about that conversation?

71
00:05:17,974 --> 00:05:19,434
[JULIUS]
Ah, I see.

72
00:05:19,517 --> 00:05:22,729
Those who weren't
blessed with mana.

73
00:05:22,812 --> 00:05:25,690
Of course that would've
caused an incident like this.

74
00:05:25,774 --> 00:05:28,777
Their lives have
been terribly unfair.

75
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,404
We must put an end
to the discrimination.

76
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,576
Uh, why are you
staring at Nero?

77
00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:37,786
Oh. Sorry.

78
00:05:37,869 --> 00:05:39,329
[knocking]

79
00:05:40,914 --> 00:05:42,999
Pardon me.

80
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,668
Lord Julius.

81
00:05:44,751 --> 00:05:46,961
We've just received a message
from Queen Loropechika

82
00:05:47,045 --> 00:05:48,213
of the Heart Kingdom.

83
00:05:48,296 --> 00:05:49,631
[BOTH gasp]

84
00:05:55,845 --> 00:05:56,888
Wait, what?

85
00:05:56,971 --> 00:05:58,765
[YAMI]
That's their queen, huh?

86
00:05:58,848 --> 00:06:00,183
It's you three.

87
00:06:00,266 --> 00:06:02,811
Oh, yeah, we were just
talking to the Wizard King.

88
00:06:02,894 --> 00:06:06,147
[LOROPECHIKA]
I see. And you back there.

89
00:06:06,231 --> 00:06:10,068
You must be Yami Sukehiro.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

90
00:06:10,151 --> 00:06:12,237
It's nice to meet you, too.

91
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,281
[YAMI] Guess she does
know about me then.

92
00:06:15,365 --> 00:06:17,617
You may have guessed
what I'm calling about,

93
00:06:17,701 --> 00:06:18,993
but I'll explain.

94
00:06:19,077 --> 00:06:22,414
As I said before, the Heart
Kingdom's elite guard,

95
00:06:22,497 --> 00:06:24,958
the Spirit Guardians,
have been preparing

96
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:27,460
for you all to
train alongside them.

97
00:06:29,713 --> 00:06:34,342
[gasps, grunts]

98
00:06:34,426 --> 00:06:37,345
[UNDINE]
Loropechika? Are you all right?

99
00:06:37,429 --> 00:06:39,014
What happened to her?

100
00:06:39,097 --> 00:06:41,391
It looked like she
was in terrible pain!

101
00:06:41,474 --> 00:06:42,726
But what caused it?

102
00:06:42,809 --> 00:06:45,895
Maybe Megicula's curse
is already taking over!

103
00:06:45,979 --> 00:06:47,522
That's not good.

104
00:06:47,605 --> 00:06:48,523
Finral!

105
00:06:48,606 --> 00:06:49,858
Huh? What's up?

106
00:06:49,941 --> 00:06:50,984
Go and check things out.

107
00:06:51,067 --> 00:06:53,611
We'll handle the
paperwork back here.

108
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,487
Be careful.

109
00:06:54,571 --> 00:06:55,822
[BOTH]
Right!

110
00:06:58,575 --> 00:07:00,577
Wait, Asta. I'm sorry.

111
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,496
Do you mind if she
stays here with us?

112
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,915
Certainly, Lord Julius.

113
00:07:07,292 --> 00:07:08,752
[FINRAL]
Asta!

114
00:07:08,835 --> 00:07:11,880
I can only hold it for
so long across this distance!

115
00:07:11,963 --> 00:07:14,090
Okay, then, here I go.

116
00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:20,013
I believe we'll be able
to communicate easier

117
00:07:20,096 --> 00:07:22,599
if you change back
into your human form.

118
00:07:24,851 --> 00:07:26,227
Now, if you'll
please follow me

119
00:07:26,311 --> 00:07:28,730
to the basement library.

120
00:07:28,813 --> 00:07:31,983
There's something
I'd like you to see.

121
00:07:32,067 --> 00:07:33,234
Oh, and Marx.

122
00:07:33,318 --> 00:07:34,736
I need you to
complete the paperwork

123
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:36,404
for their entrance to Heart.

124
00:07:36,488 --> 00:07:37,781
Er. Yes, sir.

125
00:07:37,864 --> 00:07:39,699
Right then. Let's go.

126
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,996
[FINRAL panting]

127
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,957
[NOELLE]
Why are we outside the palace?

128
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:51,586
[FINRAL panting] I think the
queen is generating a forcefield

129
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:55,465
made of mana, so I wasn't able
to get us inside the building.

130
00:07:58,927 --> 00:08:01,805
Do not advance.

131
00:08:01,888 --> 00:08:03,723
I don't know what
your business is here,

132
00:08:03,807 --> 00:08:06,434
but it seems that you've entered
our kingdom unlawfully.

133
00:08:06,518 --> 00:08:08,228
Therefore, you must be punished.

134
00:08:08,311 --> 00:08:10,105
Wait! It's fine, we swear!

135
00:08:10,188 --> 00:08:12,232
Our Wizard King is supposed
to be contacting you.

136
00:08:12,315 --> 00:08:14,401
Just give him a few
minutes, would ya?

137
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:21,366
[GAJA]
Yes. What?

138
00:08:21,449 --> 00:08:23,243
The proper entry forms
have been submitted

139
00:08:23,326 --> 00:08:27,122
from the Clover Kingdom?
I understand.

140
00:08:27,205 --> 00:08:31,418
Please forgive me. I will
escort you to the queen.

141
00:08:31,501 --> 00:08:33,128
[NOELLE, ASTA, FINRAL sigh]

142
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:38,299
[LOROPECHIKA]
Welcome, everyone.

143
00:08:43,304 --> 00:08:45,306
[NOELLE]
Is this really the same person?

144
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,892
She looks a little underdressed.

145
00:08:47,976 --> 00:08:49,477
[FINRAL]
Her clothes may be shabby,

146
00:08:49,561 --> 00:08:51,938
but they can't hide
her radiant beauty!

147
00:08:52,022 --> 00:08:54,441
Truly, we're in the
presence of a goddess!

148
00:08:54,524 --> 00:08:55,775
[gasps]

149
00:08:55,859 --> 00:08:58,069
[FINRAL]
No, wait! I'm a changed man!

150
00:08:58,153 --> 00:09:00,864
So, anyway, what brings
all of you here?

151
00:09:00,947 --> 00:09:03,283
[ASTA]
Right, I just noticed!

152
00:09:03,366 --> 00:09:05,744
You don't look like
you're in pain anymore.

153
00:09:05,827 --> 00:09:09,330
Did you come here just
to talk about my curse?

154
00:09:09,414 --> 00:09:12,459
[LOROPECHIKA yelps]

155
00:09:14,169 --> 00:09:17,130
[UNDINE]
Goodness! You tripped again?

156
00:09:20,091 --> 00:09:23,345
[YAMI]
I guess that's the Water Spirit.

157
00:09:23,428 --> 00:09:26,056
[ASTA] So your stomach hurt
because you ate two things

158
00:09:26,139 --> 00:09:28,683
for lunch that didn't
agree with each other?

159
00:09:28,767 --> 00:09:30,352
[UNDINE]
I tried to tell her.

160
00:09:30,435 --> 00:09:31,561

I'd better be
headin' back myself.

I got stuff to do.

167
00:09:45,658 --> 00:09:47,577
Heading back? But how?

00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,079
Heh! Oh, you know the answer.

So, it's not the curse!
That's good to hear!

00:09:57,087 --> 00:09:59,506
Anyway, as I was saying earlier.

Preparations for your training

174
00:10:02,342 --> 00:10:05,136
And that means...

[whimpers]

176
00:10:12,435 --> 00:10:14,187
What's wrong?

177
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:17,357
My glasses are... gone!

178
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,483
Your glasses?

179
00:10:18,566 --> 00:10:19,901
You didn't know?

180
00:10:21,695 --> 00:10:22,987
[NOELLE]
So she can't see?

181

[FINRAL]
Like, at all?

182
00:10:24,989 --> 00:10:27,033
[UNDINE]
Honestly, Loropechika!

183
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:33,373
What a shame. This is the
only pair you have left!

184
00:10:33,456 --> 00:10:34,916
I'm a klutz.

185
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,335
I always end up stepping
on them, kicking them,

186
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:39,254
dropping them, sitting on them.

187
00:10:39,337 --> 00:10:42,924
I've gone through more
glasses than I can count.

188
00:10:43,008 --> 00:10:46,219
Such a waste, and
they're custom-made!

00:10:46,302 --> 00:10:48,471
Okay! Let us help you out!

00:10:48,555 --> 00:10:50,390
Oh, don't trouble yourself.

191
00:10:50,473 --> 00:10:52,142
I think I know where they are.

192
00:10:52,225 --> 00:10:53,476
Huh?

193
00:11:02,777 --> 00:11:04,070
[NOELLE]
Wow.

194
00:11:04,154 --> 00:11:06,573
[FINRAL] Whoa. Is she
scanning the whole kingdom?

195
00:11:06,656 --> 00:11:11,119
Actually, it's only one area,
but it's probably enough.

196
00:11:11,202 --> 00:11:14,456
She usually has her eye
on the entire land at once.

197
00:11:14,539 --> 00:11:16,583
[BOTH]
Amazing.

00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:17,834
Ah! There they are!

[ASTA, FINRAL, NOELLE gasp]

Mugi?

00:11:26,217 --> 00:11:29,262
Wait. Where have I
seen that thing before--

Whoops. I should introduce you.

206
00:11:34,893 --> 00:11:37,437
This thick-pelted
lady is Big Mugi.

207
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,522
She's Mugi's mother!

208
00:11:39,606 --> 00:11:41,816
She and little Mugi
show up here at the palace

209
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,110
pretty regularly to spend
some time with me.

210
00:11:44,194 --> 00:11:47,364
We're used to them just coming
and going as they please.

Uh...

00:11:49,407 --> 00:11:50,575
[NOELLE]
That's weird.

213
00:11:50,658 --> 00:11:53,036
Why does she have
such a smug face?

214
00:11:53,119 --> 00:11:55,872
It's so adorable!

215
00:11:55,955 --> 00:11:57,957
The only problem with
these two is that they love

216
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:00,001
to stir up trouble,
so sometimes they borrow

217
00:12:00,085 --> 00:12:02,128
my belongings
without permission.

218
00:12:02,212 --> 00:12:03,672
No sweat!

00:12:03,755 --> 00:12:05,423
I'm gonna go track
down this Mugi thing

You guys'll be helping

so this is the least we can
do to repay you for that!

00:12:14,474 --> 00:12:16,017
All right, if you say so.

Loropechika wears

her royal crown,
she's using Mana Zone,

00:17:37,088 --> 00:17:40,717
I'm sorry. I tried to
dissuade you, but...

322
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,718
[NOELLE]
This is your fault!

323
00:17:41,801 --> 00:17:43,803
Why would it be my fault?

324
00:17:43,887 --> 00:17:46,598
Oh right, I guess
I did volunteer.

325
00:17:46,681 --> 00:17:47,599
Huh.

326
00:17:47,682 --> 00:17:49,267
Well, it was still
very kind of you

327
00:17:49,351 --> 00:17:51,144
to go to such great
lengths for me.

328
00:17:51,227 --> 00:17:53,980
I'm so thankful.

329
00:17:54,064 --> 00:17:56,316
I'll go to any lengths
you want, Your Majesty!

330
00:17:56,399 --> 00:17:59,069
Dammit, Finral, get it together!

331
00:17:59,152 --> 00:18:03,073
We should return
to the topic at hand.

332
00:18:03,156 --> 00:18:04,741
There was a reason why
it took so long

333
00:18:04,824 --> 00:18:07,869
to finish the preparations
for your training.

334
00:18:07,952 --> 00:18:09,079
Uh, hey.

335
00:18:09,162 --> 00:18:10,455
What's wrong?

336
00:18:10,538 --> 00:18:13,333
You do know we're
over here, right?

337
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:15,752
[LOROPECHIKA] Oh, my goodness,
how embarrassing!

338
00:18:15,835 --> 00:18:17,462
Anyway, the reason
the preparations

339
00:18:17,545 --> 00:18:20,048
had to be delayed is because...

340
00:18:20,131 --> 00:18:22,050
We needed the Spirit
Guardians to be

341
00:18:22,133 --> 00:18:25,220
at their very best when it was
time for you to meet with them.

342
00:18:25,303 --> 00:18:27,847
However, there's a limit
to how many trainees

343
00:18:27,931 --> 00:18:30,308
they'll be able to accept.

344
00:18:30,392 --> 00:18:33,061
Sounds like fun! I can't wait!

345
00:18:33,144 --> 00:18:34,521
No one said you
were going to be

346
00:18:34,604 --> 00:18:36,064
one of the trainees, dummy.

347
00:18:36,147 --> 00:18:37,440
Huh?

348
00:18:37,524 --> 00:18:39,609
Actually, we do need
Asta and Nero to participate,

349
00:18:39,693 --> 00:18:41,986
since they can both
fight at the arcane stage.

350
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:42,946
[ASTA]
Really?

351
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:44,781
Wait, you said arcane stage.

352
00:18:44,864 --> 00:18:47,367
Does that mean Captain Yami
and the Wizard King, too?

353
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:48,993
They're already so capable.

354
00:18:49,077 --> 00:18:51,871
There's probably not much
that we can teach them.

355
00:18:51,955 --> 00:18:53,957
And according
to my observations,

356
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,834
your captain's already
found a way to reach

357
00:18:55,917 --> 00:18:58,628
an even higher plane
of magic expertise.

358
00:18:58,712 --> 00:19:00,171
Seriously?

359
00:19:00,255 --> 00:19:01,756
[NOELLE]
But when?

360
00:19:06,219 --> 00:19:07,971
As embarrassing
as it is to admit,

361
00:19:08,054 --> 00:19:10,473
it appears that I've lost
the key to this door.

362
00:19:10,557 --> 00:19:13,309
Fortunately, I hear your
magic gives you the ability

363
00:19:13,393 --> 00:19:16,771
to open and close
things at will.

364
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:18,314
Mind helping me out?

365
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:25,780
[SECREÉ] I wonder what he
wants to show me in here.

366
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:28,867
Sealing Magic: Inverse Release.

367
00:19:47,635 --> 00:19:48,845
[gasps]

368
00:19:57,145 --> 00:19:58,521
[gasps]

369
00:20:03,693 --> 00:20:05,445
[SECREÉ]
That book!

370
00:20:05,528 --> 00:20:08,782
You're called Nero, but your
real name is Secré, right?

371
00:20:08,865 --> 00:20:11,034
I noticed a little note
scribbled on this page

372
00:20:11,117 --> 00:20:13,787
that says "Secré is
going to love this!"

373
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:15,246
[SECREÉ]
My prince!

374
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:16,998
You see, there's
a small population

375
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:18,792
in the Clover Kingdom
who weren't blessed

376
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:20,835
with much magic power.

377
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:22,796
But once this device
is completed,

378
00:20:22,879 --> 00:20:25,965
we'll be able to easily
solve that problem for them.

379
00:20:26,049 --> 00:20:28,718
Yes! Perhaps this will
stop the discrimination

380
00:20:28,802 --> 00:20:31,680
all those people
face. I hope so!

381
00:20:33,682 --> 00:20:35,475
When this was written,
they probably lacked

382
00:20:35,558 --> 00:20:37,811
the technique to
create this magic item,

383
00:20:37,894 --> 00:20:39,854
so I guess no one
ever finished it.

384
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:41,147
That's true.

385
00:20:41,231 --> 00:20:42,941
So, I've taken the liberty
of sending a request

386
00:20:43,024 --> 00:20:45,735
to the Magic Item Research Lab
at Magic Knights' headquarters

387
00:20:45,819 --> 00:20:48,738
to have them make it
according to this blueprint.

388
00:20:48,822 --> 00:20:51,866
If this thing had
been built before,

389
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:55,620
then perhaps this Dazu Tayak,
and those like her,

390
00:20:55,704 --> 00:20:57,205
would never have
thought it necessary

391
00:20:57,288 --> 00:21:00,792
to stage a rebellion
like they did.

392
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:03,878
Those who are blessed by mana,
and those who aren't.

393
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:05,463
The divide between
these two groups

394
00:21:05,547 --> 00:21:08,174
has done great
damage to our land.

395
00:21:08,258 --> 00:21:10,385
If we want the Clover
Kingdom to prosper,

396
00:21:10,468 --> 00:21:12,929
then we must unite
everyone in harmony.

397
00:21:13,013 --> 00:21:15,265
[gasps]

398
00:21:15,348 --> 00:21:17,392
[JULIUS]
Uh-- Is something wrong?

399
00:21:17,475 --> 00:21:19,436
[SECREÉ]
Um, no, sir.

400
00:21:23,648 --> 00:21:25,567
Hey, we're back!

401
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:29,070
[FINRAL groans]
No more portals today!

402
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:30,447
Good to see you.

403
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:31,906
Same to you.

404
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:34,576
What did you and the
Wizard King talk about?

405
00:21:34,659 --> 00:21:36,119
Not much.

406
00:21:36,202 --> 00:21:41,041
You do seem a little happier.
Must've been something good.

407
00:21:41,124 --> 00:21:42,584
I agree!

408
00:21:42,667 --> 00:21:45,128
You have been looking kind of
down in the dumps recently,

409
00:21:45,211 --> 00:21:47,297
so I'm glad something
cheered you up.

410
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,049
[ASTA]
You were sad?

411
00:21:49,132 --> 00:21:52,427
You all seem happy as well.
How did your visit go?

412
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:55,305
Oh, yeah, we got
some awesome news!

413
00:21:55,388 --> 00:21:58,892
Pretty soon, we get to go and
train with the Spirit Guardians!

414
00:21:58,975 --> 00:22:01,728
And you'll be coming
with us, of course!

415
00:22:01,811 --> 00:22:02,604
I see.

416
00:22:02,687 --> 00:22:04,064
Let's kick some butt!

417
00:22:04,147 --> 00:22:05,190
All right.

418
00:22:08,068 --> 00:22:10,528
[SECREÉ] My prince,
it looks like your wishes

419
00:22:10,612 --> 00:22:12,739
are going to be carried out.

420
00:22:12,822 --> 00:22:15,116
Julius Novachrono.

421
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,244
He truly cares about the future
of the Clover Kingdom,

422
00:22:18,328 --> 00:22:20,872
perhaps even as deeply as you.

423
00:22:20,955 --> 00:22:23,375
I swear, I'll become stronger

424
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:25,919
so that I can protect
this place we love.

425
00:23:56,968 --> 00:23:58,261
[ASTA]
Stronger.

426
00:23:58,345 --> 00:24:00,138
I have to get stronger.

427
00:24:00,221 --> 00:24:02,849
Then I can fight to keep
our kingdom safe!

428
00:24:02,932 --> 00:24:06,478
<i>Black Clover</i> , Page 150:
"The Maidens' Challenge."

429
00:24:06,561 --> 00:24:07,979
Looks like Grey
and Captain Charlotte

430
00:24:08,063 --> 00:24:09,731
are giving it their all, too!
