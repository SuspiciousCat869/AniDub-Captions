What happened?

31
00:02:27,262 --> 00:02:28,680
It was their fault.

00:02:28,763 --> 00:02:32,600
They kept asking me to show
them my Catalyst Magic.

33
00:02:32,684 --> 00:02:36,938
They wanted me to fail
so they could laugh.

He looked worried
and asked if I was okay,

35

[DAZU] I always thought
I was alone in life.

But now, I realize
that's not true.

Justice should reign
supreme in this kingdom.

316
00:21:39,956 --> 00:21:40,999
C'mon.

317
00:21:41,082 --> 00:21:42,417
Okay.

318
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:52,802
[DAZU]
I have committed a sin.

319
00:21:52,886 --> 00:21:56,723
Several, actually. That night,

320
00:21:56,806 --> 00:22:01,519
I killed my husband
and my mother-in-law.

321
00:22:01,603 --> 00:22:04,105
They were awful people.

322
00:22:04,189 --> 00:22:06,024
In their hearts,
they always mocked me

323
00:22:06,107 --> 00:22:08,485
and looked down upon me.

324
00:22:08,568 --> 00:22:10,862
But, they never said
anything outwardly,

325
00:22:10,945 --> 00:22:13,823
or let it show on their faces.

326
00:22:13,907 --> 00:22:15,992
Truthfully, I could've
lived my whole life

327
00:22:16,076 --> 00:22:18,745
pretending that I didn't notice.

328
00:22:18,828 --> 00:22:19,913
But then...

329
00:22:22,624 --> 00:22:25,335
[DAZU] Don't worry!
I'll save you, I swear!

330
00:22:25,418 --> 00:22:29,130
Please, get us out.
And hurry, or we'll die!

331
00:22:35,637 --> 00:22:38,556
Come on, Dazu.

332
00:22:39,891 --> 00:22:41,768
Good-for-nothing wench!

333
00:22:46,189 --> 00:22:47,732
[MESHU]
Dazu!

334
00:22:50,026 --> 00:22:51,778
[DAZU]
I've had enough.

335
00:23:03,331 --> 00:23:04,874
[DAZU]
Just die.

336
00:23:07,002 --> 00:23:10,547
[DAZU] I never felt an ounce
of regret over what happened.

337
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:13,883
I gave those two exactly
what they deserved.

338
00:23:15,593 --> 00:23:17,429
[DAZU] I'm sure the burn
scar that I got from him

339
00:23:17,512 --> 00:23:20,932
will fade as time goes by.

340
00:23:21,016 --> 00:23:26,646
But, the scars on my heart from
enduring years of ridicule...

341
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:29,441
I'll probably have
those for life.

342
00:23:29,524 --> 00:23:33,194
More than that, even
now that they're dead,

343
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:35,572
the flames of vengeance
that engulf my soul

344
00:23:35,655 --> 00:23:37,866
will burn forever.

345
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:40,535
Which is why I--or, rather,

346
00:23:40,618 --> 00:23:44,789
we must reach the
Spade Kingdom at any cost,

347
00:23:44,873 --> 00:23:48,084
so that we can obtain
the devil's power.

348
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:59,262
[SECREÉ] This kingdom
is embroiled in chaos,

349
00:23:59,346 --> 00:24:01,848
and the threat of
the devil still looms.

350

<i>Black Clover</i> , Page 149:
"Two Things We Need to Find."

351
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:08,772
It's always darkest
before the dawn.

352
00:24:08,855 --> 00:24:10,774
Isn't that right, my prince?
