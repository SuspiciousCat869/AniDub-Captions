00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,666
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:22,083
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:24,458
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:26,958
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:35,708
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:39,958
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:44,750
[NARRATOR] The long-awaited
Star Festival had just begun.

8
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:46,625
This event features
the annual rankings

9
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:48,750
of each Magic Knight
Squad, followed by

10
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:50,083
an announcement from
the Wizard King

11
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:52,791
regarding which squad
earned the most stars.

12
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:56,583
Kahono! And Kiato!

13
00:00:56,666 --> 00:00:58,000
[NARRATOR]
Asta had invited his friends

14
00:00:58,083 --> 00:01:01,166
from the Underwater Temple
to join in on the fun.

15
00:01:02,416 --> 00:01:03,791
[NARRATOR] The magic from
the Queen of Witches

16
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:07,333
restored both Kiato's leg
and Kahono's voice.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,875
[NARRATOR] Then, during
all the excitement...

18
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:14,125
[KAHONO]
Hey, Asta!

19
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:15,416
I've been meaning to ask you...

20
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,125
What do you think about Noelle?

21
00:01:17,208 --> 00:01:20,416
Uh... What do I think?

22
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:23,083
You're pretty great.

23
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,791
I like you a lot, Noelle.

24
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:28,250
[shrieks] Where did
that come from?

25
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:30,416
I swear, you get
dumber every day!

26
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:34,500
[ASTA yelps]
What did I do?

27
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:39,166
[ASTA screams]

28
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:43,875
[NARRATOR] To Asta's surprise,
he discovered Yami

29
00:01:43,958 --> 00:01:46,708
and Jack the Ripper, Captain
of the Green Praying Mantises,

30
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:48,583
involved in what looked
like the beginnings

31
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:50,708
of a bitter showdown.

32
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:33,333
Ah! I'll take
another one, please!

33
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:38,916
[KAHONO singing]

34
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,291
Gather round, everyone!

35
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:43,166
It's a spectacular
song-and-dance

36
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,708
from under the sea!

37
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,458
What a beautiful melody!

38
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:49,000
He's such a talented dancer!

39
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,083
I'm happy to see the
two of them doing

40
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:58,666
the things that they love again.

41
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,500
It's touching. Not bad, Dorks--

42
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:03,458
[ATTENDEE 68B]
Hm?

43
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:05,083
Just who do you think you are?

44
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:07,041
Don't crowd royalty!

45
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:09,666
Oh! I'm sorry!

46
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,625
[NOELLE]
I guess I did blow him off.

47
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:13,583
I wonder where he ended up?

48
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:16,041
Ugh, he's such an idiot!

49
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,666
All right, Asta,
where did you go?

50
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,041
Would you like a plate?

51
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,541
No, maybe later.

52
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:23,041
Care to try your luck, miss?

53
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:24,291
Maybe later.

54
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:25,791
A snack for a lovely lady?

55
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:27,208
Later.

56
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,750
[NOELLE]
Actually...

57
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,708
Yeah, now's good.

58
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:36,875
I have to admit,

59
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:38,458
commoners really
know their food.

60
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:40,041
This is tasty!

61
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:43,250
Now I just need to figure
out where Asta landed.

62
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:48,666
[NOELLE] What's with that
big concentration of mana?

63
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,833
Hey, everyone, who's hungry?

64
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,250
[gasps]

65
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:56,541
Yeah, step right up!

66
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:58,750
Try some of Captain Yami's
famous grilled squid

67
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:01,083
'cause Yami makes it yummy!

68
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:04,166
[SEKKE]
Don't listen to him! Ha, ha!

69
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,166
Captain Jack's meat dishes
are second to none!

70
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,000
One bite and they'll
send your taste buds

71
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:11,541
on a one-way trip
to culinary paradise!

72
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:14,166
That's right, you've never
had anything like it!

73
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,875
It's food for the
body and the soul!

74
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:18,458
Come and get it.

75
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:21,916
Hah!

76
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,250
What's goin' on out there, kid?

77
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:27,958
If you don't work on that
sales pitch and bring in

78
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:29,250
some more customers,
you're gonna be

79
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:30,500
the one gettin' grilled!

80
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:32,041
Right! I'm on it.

81
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:34,125
Hey there, mister, what do ya
say to some delicious squid?

82
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,500
The price is fair,
and the flavor

83
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:37,916
is totally ink-credible,
I squid you not!

84
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,958
Come on...

85
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:40,125
Hey, rookies!

86
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:41,541
If you three don't
draw in some business,

87
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,208
I'm going to carve you up next.

Ro- <i>ha</i> ger! All right,
now who's hungry?

Come have a taste!

00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:48,958
Help me or we'll
all be lunchmeat!

--[APHRO] Please buy our food!
--[PHATI] We're gonna die!

00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,625
[SEKKE]
Delicious meat!

94
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:57,333
[BOTH]
We're begging you!

A customer!

96
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,333
Okay, he flat-out ignored me.

97
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:03,333
This is only happening
because Captain Jack

98
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:06,458
decided to get competitive with
the Captain of the Black Bulls.

99

We can't give this stuff away.

00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,875
It's so tragic. Ha, ha.

they're poisoned!

here, string bean.

is a bit too slow,
if you ask me.

161
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,333
That's funny. I was just
thinkin' the exact same thing.

162
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:42,708
So now what?

163
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:45,750
I say we do somethin' that's
a little more our style.

164
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,875
[BOTH]
Time to fight to the death!

165
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:49,458
"The death"?

166
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:57,208
Look here!

167
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:58,416
[JACK cackles]

168
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,666
Huh?

169
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,000
[BOTH]
Let's play "Made-Ya-Look!"

170
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:08,583
This way!

171
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:13,541
[NOELLE]
Idiots.

172
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:14,833
Let's change it up!

173
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,750
Your funeral, pal!

174
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:25,583
[BOTH]
Next game!

175
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,583
[YAMI]
This is goin' nowhere.

176
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:34,125
[cackles] Come on.
Fight me! For real!

177
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,583
[YAMI] Yeah, you don't
want me to do that.

178
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:39,250
Am I supposed to be intimidated?

179
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:40,958
[YAMI] Look, we're
killin' the party here.

180
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:43,791
Let's take this showdown
somewhere else.

181
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:47,125
[PHATI, APHRO]
This is a good time to leave.

182
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,416
[NOELLE]
Asta! What's wrong with you?

183
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,875
--[YAMI] Hey.
--Get ahold of yourself,

184
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,000
Dorksta, this is embarrassing!

185
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,541
[YAMI]
Noelle!

186
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:54,875
What is it?

187
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:57,666
Go and hunt down Finral for me.

188
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:11,208
Hey, this is...

189
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:25,125
I don't think we'll be botherin'
anybody all the way out here.

190
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,875
This squid's got me
feelin' energized,

191
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:29,291
so you'd better get
ready for a beatin'.

192
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:30,958
I'm glad you're
enjoying that squid,

193
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:34,041
because you're about to be
chopped up and fileted as well!

194
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:37,083
How did I get dragged
into this again?

195
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:39,291
[NOELLE]
This one's pretty good, too.

196
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,291
Our Captain Jack once
cut a whole mountain

197
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:43,750
clean in half like
it was nothing!

198
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:46,125
Sorry, but the Captain of
the Black Bulls doesn't

199
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:47,791
stand a chance
against defeating him!

200
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:51,500
[laughs]

201
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:55,125
Uh, What's the ha, ha guy
all worked up for?

202
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:57,916
Women tend to be more
flirtatious at festivals.

203
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,458
I'm missing out on a golden
opportunity right now.

204
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:03,083
Oh, well.

205
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:07,375
[JULIUS] An all-out duel
between Yami and Jack.

206
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,625
How exciting.

207
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:10,666
I can't wait to see what
kind of powerful spells

208
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,000
they might show us!

209
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:15,083
Last chance to walk
away, Jackie-boy.

210
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:17,875
[cackles] Thanks for the
concern, Yami Suckyhiro,

211
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:20,000
but under the circumstances,
I think you should be

212
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:22,000
more worried about yourself.

213
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:24,916
These blades of mine are just
aching to rip you to shreds!

214
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,125
So let's go!

215
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:27,833
Last time we fought,
it wasn't a whole lot

216
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:30,458
of fun for me, since you were
on your last leg, and all.

217
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:32,583
Wait, who'd ya say
was on their last leg?

218
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:33,791
You, obviously.

219
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:35,416
Those punks from Eye
of the Midnight Sun

220
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,083
beat you senseless!

221
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:38,750
Don't be ridiculous,
that was an act.

222
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:40,666
I was just gettin' ready
to turn the tables on 'em

223
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,000
the second you showed
up on the scene!

224
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,666
[cackles] Sure ya were.

225
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,500
I can see that you're
feeling pretty confident,

226
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,208
so cutting you to
smithereens is going to be

227
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,875
a real treat for me!

228
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:52,875
Somebody's gettin' cut,
that's for damn sure!

229
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:55,458
[FINRAL] Well, these two
are as scary as ever.

230
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:56,708
[ASTA]
Whoa!

231
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:59,208
This is awesome--their
ki is through the roof!

232
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:02,125
[NOELLE] Why can't there be any
normal Magic Knight Captains?

233
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:05,791
A breathtaking battle is
about to begin! Ha, ha!

234
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:08,000
[NOELLE]
Again, what's with this guy?

235
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:28,583
[ALL gasp]

236
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:29,833
Ha, huh?

237
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,375
Ooh!

238
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:41,291
Dark Magic:
Dark-Cloaked Black Blade!

239
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:46,708
[cackles] That's not bad.
Severing Magic: Death Scythe!

240
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,416
Did you see that?

241
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,916
Oh, come on, that was nothing.

242
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,583
We all know Captain Yami has
way more powerful abilities.

243
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:56,625
That's our Captain Jack! Ha, ha!

244
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,791
[YAMI coughs]
Damn, that was dangerous!

245
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:03,041
He's okay!

246
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:04,666
That's right, his
Lightless Slash allows him

247
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,125
to draw in his opponent's
magic attacks.

248
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:10,125
So, that's why Captain Jack
couldn't hurt him!

249
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:12,375
We never doubted you
for a second, Captain!

250
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,875
Now we're talking!

251
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:17,375
Both Yami and Jack have such
incredible magical prowess!

252
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:20,125
Why dontcha let me
show you somethin'?

253
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:22,250
I just happen to have
an ace in the hole.

254
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:24,958
Oh, well then, let's see it!

255
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:27,125
[YAMI] During that
Underwater Temple mission,

256
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:29,666
I awakened a brand new spell.

257
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,375
Now I even scare myself.

258
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,166
[cackles] That
sounds interesting.

259
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,875
Show me what you've got then!

260
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:37,125
Did he say "new spell"?

261
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:38,916
No, he wouldn't.

262
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,458
What's all this?

263
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:44,583
[gasps] He's gonna
use that on him?

264
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,291
This is bad news, Finral.

265
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,875
Don't you think you'd better
put a stop to it soon?

266
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,208
What? Me?

267
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:56,041
That spell's too
serious for just this!

268
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,041
You're right, Jack is a
Magic Knight Captain.

269
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:01,083
We can't let Yami hit him
with something that deadly!

270
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:02,541
[FINRAL]
Yeah, good point.

271
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:03,833
[NOELLE]
If one of them goes down,

272
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:05,833
someone'll be held responsible!

273
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:08,333
Besides, the Clover Kingdom's
defenses will suffer

274
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:11,083
without them, and
then what'll happen?

275
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:12,333
Something bad?

276
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:13,791
What if the
Diamond Kingdom army

277
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:16,416
or the Eye of the Midnight Sun
decides to attack us?

278
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,791
[gasps]

279
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:20,125
If you don't stop this now,
then it's on your head!

280
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:21,708
You'd blame me for that?

281
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:24,125
A- <i>ha</i> ll your fa- <i>ha</i> lt!
Do something!

282
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,291
Ugh, this guy's the worst.

283
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:30,041
You will fix this.
It is a royal command!

284
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:32,750
Oh, You love using
that, don't you?

285
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:37,333
[FINRAL] She's right, though.
I have to intervene.

286
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:39,750
We can't afford to
lose one of them.

287
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,625
When he first cast
Dimension Slash.

288
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,541
I thought the cave
would fall in.

289
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:45,083
If it does...

290
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,125
[FINRAL]
...we're all screwed.

291
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:53,333
I'm the highest-ranking Knight
here, so it's up to me!

292
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:55,833
Hey, I think you'd better stop
this right now, Captain Yami--

293
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:56,958
[YAMI]
No!

294
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:58,708
[ASTA]
Finral!

295
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:00,458
Mind your own business!

296
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:02,208
Talk about being useless.

297
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:04,708
Indeed, that was
utterly shameful!

298
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,916
You're not exactly
helping either.

299
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,291
Bring it on.

300
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,500
After you.

301
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:13,416
[YAMI]
Dark Magic: Dark Cloaked.

302
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,458
[JACK]
Severing Magic:

303
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,458
--[JACK] Go, Death Scythe!
--[YAMI] Dimension Slash!

304
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:21,041
[ALL gasp]

305
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:25,791
Time-Binding Magic:
Chrono Stasis.

306
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:32,041
[JULIUS] I would have liked
to see that new spell.

307
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:35,333
But unfortunately, as Asta and
friends so wisely concluded,

308
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:37,208
we shouldn't allow
such harm to befall

309
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:39,291
our Magic Knight Captains,
nor should we risk

310
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:40,791
the cave collapsing in on itself

311
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:42,875
from the impact,
for that matter.

312
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:46,250
We'll just save Dimension
Slash for another time.

313
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:47,500
[MARX]
Your Majesty!

314
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:49,333
Where did you go now?

315
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:50,583
Oh, hello, Marx.

316
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:52,833
I've been out observing
something interesting.

317
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:54,875
We're much too busy for
fun and games, sir.

318
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,416
We have to prepare
for the announcement

319
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,875
of the Magic Knights'
rankings during

320
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,875
the Star Festival this evening!

321
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:01,250
Oh, is that today?

322
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:02,958
Would you please try
to be reasonable?

323
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:06,041
Our nation's King is waiting!
You must return at once!

324
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:08,583
It isn't healthy for you
to be so uptight, you know.

325
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:10,541
Do try to relax more, Marx.

326
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:12,416
It's because of you!

327
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,083
Well, it would appear that
I am needed elsewhere.

328
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:18,750
I'm sure we'll meet again soon.

329
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,000
Ah!

330
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:22,208
Before I take my leave,
let's be sure to prevent

331
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:23,958
these two from fighting anymore.

332
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:27,666
Now let's see here. There,
that should do the trick.

333
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:30,041
[YAMI]
Dimension Slash--

334
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,375
[JACK]
Go, Death Scythe!

335
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:43,916
What just happened?

336
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:46,833
[YAMI]
Uh...

337
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:50,750
Put some pants on, ya sicko!

338
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:53,000
[cackles] Back at you!

339
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:56,375
Keh.

340
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:58,666
[YAMI, JACK laugh]

341
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,333
[YAMI]
Man. I feel pretty stupid now.

342
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:04,250
Stop making me laugh, Yami.

343
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:07,541
I think I've lost
my urge for slashing.

344
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:09,416
So, is it over?

345
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,958
Whew, that's a relief.

346
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:12,208
Now I won't have to worry about

347
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:14,583
getting blamed for
anything! And, you two!

348
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:17,125
What would you have done
if somebody had died?

349
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:18,500
[BOTH]
You idiot!

350
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:20,625
We all know this guy wouldn't
go down that easily!

351
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:22,125
Ah.

352
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,125
[FINRAL]
You're missing the point!

353
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,291
The closer people are,
the more they fight.

354
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:29,875
Just make sure to do
it responsibly! Ha, ha!

355
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:32,541
Look, your little
schtick is getting old.

356
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,750
[JACK cackles]
Hey, this is decent.

357
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:38,541
Your food isn't
half bad, either.

358
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,458
Well, I'm glad you think so.

359
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:43,791
Gimme a minute and I'll whip
up some dessert for you.

360
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,541
Why are you standing there?
Go get the thing!

361
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:47,166
Yes, Captain.

362
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,041
[JACK]
Watch and learn.

363
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:51,958
[SEKKE]
It's so co- <i>ho</i> ld!

364
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:57,250
Wow. That's impressive.

365
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:58,750
[JACK]
Give it a try.

366
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,333
[YAMI]
Thank you.

367
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:02,875
[NOELLE] They fight because
they're so close, huh?

368
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:05,000
Maybe Sekke was right.

369
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,791
Uh. Hey, Asta.

370
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:10,041
Look, if you argue with
me once in a while,

371
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:12,541
I guess I don't mind too much.

372
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,541
Uh, okay. Huh.

373
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:16,125
Yeah, I think I'm
gonna go and see

374
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:18,416
what everyone else is up to.

375
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:22,791
Eh, we might as well call
it a draw for the day.

376
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:27,000
That puts me at 53 wins,
no losses, and 34 draws.

377
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,333
I don't think so.

378
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:31,500
Because by my count,
we're at 98 wins, no losses,

379
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:32,916
and one draw for me.

380
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,458
Oh, I'm sorry, I meant
to say I've got no losses

381
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:37,208
and a 156 wins.

382
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:40,791
Then I've got 567 wins!

383
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,166
No way!

384
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,916
I can prove it!

385
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,208
If you wanna settle the score

386
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,416
once and for all,
we can do it right now!

387
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,166
I thought you'd never ask.

388
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,625
Bring it, shrimp!

389
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:53,666
Come and get me, musclehead!

390
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,875
Again? Hurry, Asta,
you have to stop them!

391
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:57,916
Why me?

392
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,541
Because you're the
only one here!

393
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,125
You're here, aren't ya?

394
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,333
I can't, I'm royalty!

395
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:05,541
Wait a minute, let's
all ca- <i>ha</i> lm down and--

396
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:07,041
Shut up!

397
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:10,875
[NOELLE] See, now there's
really no one else!

398
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:14,416
If you say so.

399
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,375
Here's the thing, Captain
Yami and Captain Jack.

400
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,333
We came to the festival
to have a good time,

401
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:21,916
not beat each other up,
so could you maybe

402
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
just try to get along,
for today? Pretty please?

403
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:26,750
[YAMI]
Look, kid.

404
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,791
Don't butt in!

405
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:33,041
[ASTA screams]

406
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:34,208
Asta, come back!

407
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:36,500
[KAHONO]
Thank you so much!

408
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:43,000
You've been such
a wonderful audience!

409
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:44,458
Just wait and see!

410
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:47,250
One day, we'll become
famous pop stars!

411
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:50,208
The singing, dancing,
magic-using idols.

412
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:51,625

413
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:52,875
And Kiato!

[KAHONO, KIATO]
We look forward to your support!

415
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,833
And making a lot
of money! A whole lot!

416
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:01,666
[ASTA screaming]
Hey, Kiato! Hey, Kahono!

417
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,541
Asta?

418
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:06,125
[VANESSA sighs]
There you are, Finral.

419
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:08,333
I was starting to wonder
what you were up to.

420
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,291
Collecting rejections, I assume?

421
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,458
I mean, that is a
thing that happened.

422
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:15,875
But there's a lot more
to the story, too.

423
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:17,791
Oh, is that so?

424
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:19,125
[FINRAL]
Yeah, I'm exhausted.

425
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:20,958
Aw, loosen up,
the Star Festival

426
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:22,000
is just getting started!

427
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:23,166
[FINRAL]
Oh, thanks.

428
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:26,416
[VANESSA] Go on.
Drink up, sweetie. Cheers!

429
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,208
Eh, might as well.

430
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,750
[mumbling] I know what happened.

431
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:32,208
Captain Yami must've
summoned you

432
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:34,000
and ordered you to use
your Spatial Magic.

433
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:36,875
That must've been rough on you,
so here's to a job well done.

00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:39,875
[screaming]

Are you okay, son?

[ASTA] Sheesh, Captain
Yami, did ya have to

437
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:47,916
throw me that far?

438
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,166
He survived that?

439
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,375
Wow, talk about resilient.

440
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,208
Where the heck am I now?

441
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:56,833
I gotta hurry and get
back to the others.

442
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:00,375
Huh?

443
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:02,250
[ADMIRER 68A]
She's so beautiful!

444
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:03,416
[ADMIRER 68B]
Look at her!

00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,750
[ADMIRER 68C]
She must come from money.

446
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:06,666
[ADMIRER 68A] Hey, why don't
you go talk to her?

447
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,583
[ADMIRER 68B]
No way, I can't!

448
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:10,791
[ASTA]
They're right, she is pretty.

449
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:13,875
I betcha Finral would go crazy!

450
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,458
[ASTA]
Wait a second.

451
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:21,791
I think I've seen her before.

[YAMI]
"Grilled Squid."

454
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,083
[YAMI] Today I'm gonna
show you how to prepare

455
00:23:06,166 --> 00:23:08,166
this tasty grilled squid.

456
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,166
[BOTH]
Yay!

457
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:11,583
It's so easy, anyone can do it.

458
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:13,041
But you're not going to cheat

459
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:15,958
and use magic like that one
chef did before, are you?

460
00:23:16,041 --> 00:23:18,916
What? Just watch.

461
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,416
First, pull out the guts
and cut slits into it.

462
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,833
[ASTA]
Real directions!

463
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:24,250
[YAMI]
Yeah!

464
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:28,000
[YAMI]
Then you season it with salt,

465
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:30,875
sugar, mirin, and ginger.

466
00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:31,958
Okay.

467
00:23:32,041 --> 00:23:33,375
[YAMI]
Then grill it.

468
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:35,083

00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:36,583

And, done.

Grilled delicious squid
that anyone can make.
