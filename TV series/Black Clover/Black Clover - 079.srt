1
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,708
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:18,583
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:24,333
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:27,000
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:35,541
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:39,750
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,041
[NARRATOR] Round Two, Match One
of the Royal Knights

8
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:45,750
Selection Exam.

9
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:47,750
Team B was at a
distinct disadvantage

10
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:51,291
against Kirsch's
overwhelming magic might.

11
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:53,583
Black Hurricane!

12
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:55,833
[NARRATOR] But Asta channeled
his dark power to nullify

13
00:00:55,916 --> 00:00:58,750
Kirsch's spells in one fell
swoop--along with some

14
00:00:58,833 --> 00:01:02,208
traps the mysterious mage Xerx
had set up before the exam.

15
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:03,833
Now, they're back to square one.

16
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:05,250
[ASTA] There's only one
way to beat a team

17
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:06,875
as strong as that,
n' guess what?

18
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:08,500
It's by makin' a team
that's stronger!

19
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:10,208
So I guess that leaves
me with no choice

20
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:11,750
but to put you to use.

21
00:01:11,833 --> 00:01:13,708
[NARRATOR] Working together
for the first time,

22
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:16,000
Zora and Asta set up
an ingenious snare

23
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:18,666
that successfully lured in
the self-absorbed Kirsch

24
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,333
and removed him from
the battlefield.

25
00:01:20,416 --> 00:01:22,958
I told ya that you and me
could make a good team.

26
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:02,916
[MIMOSA] Okay. According to
my Magic Flower Guidepost,

27
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,875
the enemy hid their crystal
inside of Sol's golem.

28
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:12,083
[MIMOSA] If I use this seed to
plant my Magic-Controlling Weeds

29
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:14,583
inside of Sol's spell,
we can win this.

30
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:16,708
It'll let me take control
of her little mud pet

31
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:19,375
long enough to expose
the gem and shatter it.

32
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:20,708
The problem is,

33
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:23,458
that spell needs time to
sprout and put down roots.

34
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:26,791
And I'd have to fight as though
I didn't know the seed was sown.

35
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:29,375
Will I be able to pull
off a feint like that?

36
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:33,916
Plant Magic: Magic Canon Flower!

37
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:38,041
You're not as weak as I thought.
But not good enough.

38
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:40,250
Earth Magic: Clod Seal!

39
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:42,291
[MIMOSA gasps, yelps]

40
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,708
I wanna win, but I'm
not into hurting women.

41
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:48,833
How about you stay outta this?

42
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:50,666
I have to warn the others!

43
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,041
[SOL]
Now, then.

44
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:55,291
I wonder how far that
hothead can get on his own.

45
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:56,791
It was only a matter
of time before

46
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:59,708
your overconfidence
led to your downfall.

47
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:01,750
And now look at you.

48
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,916
I can't believe you fell
for such a primitive trap.

49
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,791
Are you really a vice captain?

50
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:09,625
Save some face and quit already.

51
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,708
Egotistical morons like
you make me sick.

52
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:15,583
By the way, your precious
face is all scratched up.

53
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:17,333
[ASTA] Why are ya pilin'
the insults on a guy

54
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:20,583
who's totally out cold?
Still, this was a great idea!

55
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:21,666
May have been a bit risky,

56
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,375
but that pitfall worked
out in the end.

57
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:26,458
See? I knew you'd come up
with somethin' crafty.

58
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:28,583
Never thought my sword
would double as a shovel,

59
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:32,083
but it got the job done way
faster than I thought it would.

60
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:34,666
[ZORA] I have to admit your
speed was impressive.

61
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,125
And you barely broke a sweat.

62
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:39,000
You pack a lot of muscle
in that tiny frame.

63
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:40,916
Hey, thanks, man,
I've been training!

64
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,958
Now. This guy may be
a fool, but he's strong.

65
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:47,208
No telling what he'll
do when he wakes up.

66
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:50,416
I'll put a magic circle near
the entrance just in case.

67
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,458
[ASTA] Whoa! So that's
how you lay traps!

68
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:55,458
And they just disappear!

69
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:58,125
[ZORA] If anyone shows up
and tries to rescue the fool:

70
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:00,458
kaboom. [chuckles]

71
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:02,666
Might as well bury
him while I'm at it.

72
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,458
Can't be too careful.

73
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:07,083
[ASTA]
Hey! That's overkill!

74
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:09,208
Not to mention my sword's
down there with him!

75
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:11,666

Wow, you're really bringin'
the heat, huh, Magna!

81
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,875
I know better than
to get close enough

82
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,833
for you to attack me, Asta.

83
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:32,083
But at this distance,
I'm sure to win this match.

84
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:33,416
Call it revenge
for what happened

85
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,916
during your stupid baptism!

86
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:38,625
Don't think that I haven't
grown into a more

87
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:40,958
powerful wizard than
I was back then!

88

You gotta prove it. Bring it on!

89
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:46,041

All right!

91
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:53,416
I can hit this back. No problem!

92
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,291
You're not gonna get
this crystal, Magna!

93
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:02,833
Uh-oh!

94
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:06,333
[laughs] Now that's
a swing and a miss.

My new Annihilation
Massacre Fireball

96

vanishes before it
ever hits its target.

97
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:12,583
There's no way can
you stop something

98
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:15,041
that disappears right
before your eyes.

99
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,208
[ASTA]
That's an awesome spell.

100
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:20,083
I shouldn't be surprised,
coming from Magna.

101
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:22,750
Oh. Quite impressive!

102
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:25,541
Turns out he's more
skilled than he looks.

103
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,250
You should see him
fire up the grill

104
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,958
whenever we have a big barbecue.

105
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,333
[ASTA] If I try to get close to
Magna, he'll just sprint away

106
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:34,583
with that speedy
spell from earlier.

107
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:37,333
Plus, I'd be leavin'
the crystal wide open.

108
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:40,625
I'd need to go all Black Asta
to get close to him quickly.

109
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:43,833
But that power's
still cooling down.

[MAGNA yelps] Aw, man, not
again. Hit by my own spell!

314
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:48,791
Well, this just proves
that my magic is awesome.

315
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:53,875
Magic is the essence of beauty,
and that sword wipes it out.

I shall no longer
simply scorn you,

Instead, I shall destroy

Bingo.

Our boys really
hustled out there!

I guess, we'll have
to drink a toast to them

Oh, heck yeah! We did it!
Nice job, snazzymask.

Not that I'm surprised,
because teamwork

Aw, yeah, bring it in

You're mad about that?

You're good, but you
got sloppy out there.

376
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:30,833
If you'd been a little more
attuned to the subtleties

of magic power, you
might not have lost.

of his mana during the warm-up.

380
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:41,416
Maybe it's a habit
for commoners but,

381
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,250
you've gotta learn
how to say "when."

And there's you,
the royal narcissist.

You were far too arrogant
the entire time.

00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:52,916
Falling to pieces just
because you got punched

as lower than you?

You're going way too far

What you said back then.

393
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,916
Sometimes it is true
that a commoner's

00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,083
impoverished condition can
lead their soul to ruin.

I agree.

But, true beauty is something

that commoners can be mighty,

404
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:46,000
you fought beside them,

to go on a romantic
date with Char.

419
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:04,500
Well, no one who's
shorter than her,

420
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:08,375
that's for sure.
And no lame gutter punks.

421
00:23:08,458 --> 00:23:12,041
Can't be pairing her up with
anybody who's that gaudy.

422
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:14,166
Narcissists are a hard pass.

423
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:16,708
Quiet people wouldn't suit her.

So, someone who's
taller than Char,

00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:32,916
not a punk or gaudy
or a narcissist,

430
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,958
who can pleasantly chat
with her, is stronger,

431
00:23:35,041 --> 00:23:36,916
and will love her and
her alone. Let's see,
