1
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,807
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,311
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:30,395 --> 00:00:32,480
All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:32,564 --> 00:00:36,276
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:41,031
The hero's name was
Lumiere Silvamillion Clover.

6
00:00:42,574 --> 00:00:45,577
[NARRATOR] He was later hailed
as the First Wizard King,

7
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,663
and his story became legend.

8
00:02:24,259 --> 00:02:26,886
[GUELDRE] What was that
shaking sensation just now?

9
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,263
Did something happen up there?

10
00:02:28,346 --> 00:02:30,140
[REVCHI] I'm more curious
about these dreadful

11
00:02:30,223 --> 00:02:33,143
purple things crawling all over.

12
00:02:33,226 --> 00:02:35,353
[REVCHI] If not for Gueldre's
Transparency Magic,

13
00:02:35,437 --> 00:02:37,272
we'd be dead by now.

14
00:02:37,355 --> 00:02:38,690
And worse than that,
this fortress

15
00:02:38,773 --> 00:02:41,151
is practically infested
with strong mages.

16
00:02:41,234 --> 00:02:42,527
I don't know what
I was thinking,

17
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:44,654
walking into a
situation like this.

18
00:02:44,738 --> 00:02:46,281
Look at it this way.

19
00:02:46,364 --> 00:02:48,241
There's always a little
bit of danger involved

20
00:02:48,324 --> 00:02:50,744
in any decision a person makes.

21
00:02:50,827 --> 00:02:52,871
[GUELDRE] That said,
we should probably escape

22
00:02:52,954 --> 00:02:54,539
before I run out of mana.

23
00:02:54,622 --> 00:02:56,666
Which way to the exit?

24
00:03:06,468 --> 00:03:09,012
Licht's ultimate move
seems to be working.

25
00:03:09,095 --> 00:03:11,431
They couldn't
withstand its power.

26
00:03:11,514 --> 00:03:12,766
I still can't wrap
my head around

27
00:03:12,849 --> 00:03:14,642
how killer that spell was.

28
00:03:14,726 --> 00:03:16,853
It really saved
our asses, though.

29
00:03:16,936 --> 00:03:20,190
Only problem is, we got sent
all the way down here.

30
00:03:20,273 --> 00:03:23,568
And thanks for fixin' my arm;
you're kinda nice after all.

31
00:03:23,651 --> 00:03:26,696
Huh. I just wanted
us to be even.

32
00:03:28,865 --> 00:03:32,452
[YAMI] I might have one more
Dimension Slash in me.

33
00:03:33,578 --> 00:03:36,790
[YAMI] But I can feel that
evil mana and ki from here.

34
00:03:36,873 --> 00:03:40,627
Does that mean elf-boy's
best attack wasn't enough?

35
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:44,798
[YAMI]
I wanna jump back in there,

36
00:03:44,881 --> 00:03:47,717
but until I have a plan,
I'd better wait.

37
00:03:47,801 --> 00:03:49,886
For whatever reason,
my Darkness Magic

38
00:03:49,969 --> 00:03:53,765
seemed to be a match
for that devil.

39
00:03:53,848 --> 00:03:55,558
I guess all I need
to do now is land

40
00:03:55,642 --> 00:03:57,727
one final hit on him.

41
00:03:59,145 --> 00:04:01,856
[YAMI] The only other
contender we've got

42
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:05,193
is the one guy
with no magic at all.

43
00:04:05,276 --> 00:04:07,696
The weapon he's using
belongs to Licht.

44
00:04:07,779 --> 00:04:09,197
What happened?

45
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,032
After Licht's grimoire changed,

46
00:04:11,116 --> 00:04:14,077
it became possible for
evil beings to use it.

47
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,955
And then, when it made
contact with a different devil,

48
00:04:17,038 --> 00:04:19,749
it apparently gained
the power of Anti-magic.

00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:22,419
[ASTA grunting]

50

over that ability.

53

[KOTODAMA DEVIL] He broke
a spear from the other world!

54
00:04:36,766 --> 00:04:39,227
It's supposed to trap
Light Magic and warp space,

55
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,938
but none of that
worked against him!

Even with the four-leaf
on our side, we can't win!

There's only one thing

Sounds like you're
not all right, then.

It's not very likely to work,
but I can bind it using

[LUMIERE] Our magic had
dispersed into the air,

103

but he used his wind
to condense it and made it

104

into a weapon that could
combat the devil's attacks.

I'm going to exterminate
every single one of you!

159
00:10:48,346 --> 00:10:50,181
[gasps]

160
00:10:50,265 --> 00:10:53,768
[CHARLOTTE] I think that
devil's getting serious now!

161
00:10:53,852 --> 00:10:56,021
He's about to
swallow up everything!

162
00:10:56,104 --> 00:10:58,815
So he's been holding
back this whole time?

163
00:10:58,898 --> 00:11:00,316
[YAMI] But with all
this crap in the way,

164
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,610
we can't get close to him!

165
00:11:05,196 --> 00:11:08,408
[PATRY] This is going poorly
even for the best of us!

166
00:11:08,491 --> 00:11:11,411
I'm worried about our allies
on the lower floors.

167
00:11:11,494 --> 00:11:14,914
[LICHT] Patry. Defend the
perimeter for now.

168
00:11:14,998 --> 00:11:18,293
We'll handle this.
No matter what happens,

169
00:11:18,376 --> 00:11:20,837
we can't let the people
of this era be killed.

170
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,048
We need the present-day
Magic Knights.

171
00:11:23,131 --> 00:11:25,342
They're the future
of the Clover Kingdom!

172
00:11:25,425 --> 00:11:28,136
[KOTODAMA DEVIL] You're nothing
more than a lump of meat!

173
00:11:28,219 --> 00:11:31,014
--I'll kill all of you.
--I'll slaughter you one by one!

174
00:11:31,097 --> 00:11:34,517
--Humanity is finished.
--You're nothing more than...

175
00:11:34,601 --> 00:11:36,561
Now, the finale.

176
00:11:36,644 --> 00:11:38,396
Ha. You think it's over?

177
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,483
You don't get to
decide how this ends!

178
00:11:41,566 --> 00:11:44,194
You ready, Yuno? Let's go!

179
00:11:44,277 --> 00:11:47,572
Of course I'm ready, idiot.

180
00:11:47,655 --> 00:11:50,241
[BOTH] Time to shut
this guy up for good!

181
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:01,294
[KOTODAMA DEVIL]
You're no better than vomit.

182
00:12:01,378 --> 00:12:04,964
A mere insect that had
the nerve to bite me.

183
00:12:05,048 --> 00:12:09,886
Die. The only atonement
is your deaths!

184
00:12:09,969 --> 00:12:13,264
You're just maggots
hiding under a rock.

185
00:12:13,348 --> 00:12:15,642
I'll twist off
your arms and legs.

186
00:12:15,725 --> 00:12:17,477
--Die!
--I'll rot your mana

187
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:22,065
and life away, bit by bit!

188
00:12:22,148 --> 00:12:23,692
Die!

189
00:12:25,485 --> 00:12:28,363
[YUNO] The Anti-magic
is really affecting him!

190
00:12:28,446 --> 00:12:30,824
That's why he avoided
that blow to his heart,

191
00:12:30,907 --> 00:12:33,451
and why he's so furious
about getting hit!

192
00:12:33,535 --> 00:12:36,287
So that means, if we
can get Asta's sword

193
00:12:36,371 --> 00:12:38,498
to actually pierce his heart...!

194
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:42,794
[ASTA]
These things go on forever!

195
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:47,841
[ASTA] This sucks, my body's
starting to reach its limit!

196
00:12:47,924 --> 00:12:49,843
[LUMIERE]
That Anti-magic boy.

197
00:12:49,926 --> 00:12:52,512
He's fighting side-by-side
with the Wind Magic user

198
00:12:52,595 --> 00:12:56,182
and trusting him completely.
They can do this.

199
00:12:59,477 --> 00:13:02,313
[LUMIERE, LICHT] We'll leave it
to them and help their friends!

200
00:13:06,568 --> 00:13:09,821
[JACK]
Severing Magic: Death Scythe!

201
00:13:09,904 --> 00:13:11,948
[cackles] Almost time!

202
00:13:12,032 --> 00:13:13,658
Soon I'll be able
to slice this girl's

203
00:13:13,742 --> 00:13:15,618
healing magic into tiny pieces!

204
00:13:15,702 --> 00:13:17,120
Wait a second!

205
00:13:17,203 --> 00:13:19,372
[FANA] We really
shouldn't be fighting!

206
00:13:19,456 --> 00:13:20,582
[rumbling]

207
00:13:20,665 --> 00:13:22,250
[BOTH gasp]

208
00:13:25,003 --> 00:13:26,379
[FANA yelps]

209
00:13:26,463 --> 00:13:28,631
I thought you guys went
to a different floor!

210
00:13:28,715 --> 00:13:29,924
No time to explain,

211
00:13:30,008 --> 00:13:32,385
this place is about to
flood with inhuman magic!

212
00:13:32,469 --> 00:13:34,929
Everyone evacuate, quickly!

213
00:13:36,014 --> 00:13:41,061
[MEREOLEONA] Mana Zone:
Calidos Brachium, Barrage!

214
00:13:42,228 --> 00:13:44,147
Captain Mereoleona's here, too?

215
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:48,651
[laughs] I've never seen
a spell like that!

216
00:13:48,735 --> 00:13:50,862
This world is amazing!

217
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:54,157
Ew, gross! Where
the heck did this

218
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,701
nasty-looking purple
stuff come from?

219
00:13:56,785 --> 00:13:59,329
[FUEGOLEON] Things are
getting dire! Oh, no!

220
00:13:59,412 --> 00:14:00,872
[FUEGOLEON]
It's catching up!

221
00:14:03,792 --> 00:14:05,502
[LICHT]
The Demon-Dweller Sword connects

222
00:14:05,585 --> 00:14:07,045
those who have strong bonds,

223
00:14:07,128 --> 00:14:10,048
allowing them to
share their power.

224
00:14:10,131 --> 00:14:12,884
[LUMIERE] Since my magic has
a chance against the devil,

225
00:14:12,967 --> 00:14:15,637
we'll use the sword
to send it to everyone!

226
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,223
[LUMIERE, LICHT] Combo Spell:
Demon-Dweller Sword,

227
00:14:18,306 --> 00:14:19,849
Protecting Light!

228
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:29,359
[CHARMY gasps]

229
00:14:31,778 --> 00:14:34,447
This power... What is it?

230
00:14:34,531 --> 00:14:36,282
Looks like Licht and
that prince of yours

231
00:14:36,366 --> 00:14:38,702
combined their abilities
into one big spell.

232
00:14:38,785 --> 00:14:40,537
How do you know that?

233
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,330
[RHYA] My connection
with Licht shows me

234
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:44,708
what's going on above our heads.

235
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:46,251
Isn't that nice?

236
00:14:46,334 --> 00:14:49,713
He got to have a little reunion
with his long-lost friend.

237
00:14:49,796 --> 00:14:54,217
Heh. Aw. I gotta say,
it makes me feel kinda jealous.

238
00:14:56,636 --> 00:14:58,471
[LUMIERE]
As long as this spell holds,

239
00:14:58,555 --> 00:15:00,348
I won't let a single one die!

240
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:01,850
[gasps]

Light Whip of Judgment!

243
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,356
The bond they have...

244
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,192
This time, I'll trust it!

245
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:14,738
[ASTA gasps]

246
00:15:19,492 --> 00:15:21,244
[YUNO] With this spell
acting as a shield,

247
00:15:21,327 --> 00:15:23,038
we can focus on our attacks.

248
00:15:23,121 --> 00:15:25,665
Hey! Where'dja get
that light from?

249
00:15:25,749 --> 00:15:27,625
No fair, come on, I want one!

250
00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:29,044
I know you get angry anytime

251
00:15:29,127 --> 00:15:30,879
something proves
I'm better than you,

252
00:15:30,962 --> 00:15:32,547
but we're in the
middle of something!

00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,299
Heh! Fine, pretty boy.

254
00:15:34,382 --> 00:15:36,301
Careful though, you might
mess up your hair!

255
00:15:36,384 --> 00:15:39,429
[KOTODAMA DEVIL] It'll be so
much fun to watch you die.

256
00:15:39,512 --> 00:15:42,098
Your sword still
hasn't reached me.

257
00:15:42,182 --> 00:15:44,642
It's utterly useless.

258
00:15:44,726 --> 00:15:46,353
Already.

259
00:15:46,436 --> 00:15:49,814
Right here. Just like this.

260
00:15:49,898 --> 00:15:52,442
Finally.

261
00:15:52,525 --> 00:15:55,070
Keep your distance, human--
you're too close to me again.

262
00:15:55,153 --> 00:15:56,821
Hey! If you didn't have me here,

263
00:15:56,905 --> 00:15:59,407
you'd be eyeballs deep
in that purple crap.

264
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:00,992
Anyway, didn't you
say you could see

265
00:16:01,076 --> 00:16:03,828
what's happening
on the upper floor?

266
00:16:03,912 --> 00:16:06,122
I'm thinking going
by mana and ki alone

267
00:16:06,206 --> 00:16:08,917
probably isn't the
safest strategy for us.

268
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,503
Keep me updated on what that
freak's doing, would ya?

269
00:16:11,586 --> 00:16:13,254
And stop complaining so much.

270
00:16:13,338 --> 00:16:14,339
You're kidding.

271
00:16:14,422 --> 00:16:16,549
You think that'll
work from here?

272
00:16:16,633 --> 00:16:19,803
Well, I'd prefer to be
asked more politely,

273
00:16:19,886 --> 00:16:22,764
but I'll add momentum
to your strike.

274
00:16:22,847 --> 00:16:24,849
You'd better not miss!

275
00:16:24,933 --> 00:16:26,142
I won't.

276
00:16:26,226 --> 00:16:27,477
[YUNO, ASTA, YAMI]
We'll finish off this battle

277
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,688
with an all-out attack!

278
00:16:31,398 --> 00:16:33,400
[SECRÉ] At first,
I only got close to you

279
00:16:33,483 --> 00:16:35,235
so that I could use you.

280
00:16:35,318 --> 00:16:37,946
You had no magic,
but you happened to obtain

281
00:16:38,029 --> 00:16:41,032
the five-leaf grimoire
that repelled magic.

282
00:16:41,116 --> 00:16:44,619
And then, the more time
I spent around you,

283
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:46,996
the more times I saw you fight,

284
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,416
the more I wanted
to believe in you.

285
00:16:49,499 --> 00:16:51,876
I wanted to cheer you on!

286
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,586
So please,

287
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:56,589
win this, Asta.

[YUNO yells]

00:17:12,897 --> 00:17:16,609
[YUNO] I can feel this light
making me even stronger!

291
00:17:16,693 --> 00:17:19,612
Looks like he's
maxed out, though.

292
00:17:19,696 --> 00:17:23,992
Sorry, Asta, but if you can't
keep up, I'm ditching you.

293
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:29,289
[ASTA] You should know that's
never gonna happen!

294
00:17:37,797 --> 00:17:39,549
[KOTODAMA DEVIL]
You're just a human,

295
00:17:39,632 --> 00:17:43,720
yet you're using elven and
spirit power to fight me.

296
00:17:43,803 --> 00:17:45,680
They'll never pierce
through my heart

297
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:48,058
with a silly gust of wind!

298
00:17:48,141 --> 00:17:50,477
Meanwhile, that
obnoxious fool is merely

299
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,855
letting himself be pulled
along by his partner's spell.

300
00:17:53,938 --> 00:17:56,274
And poorly, I might add!

301
00:17:56,358 --> 00:17:58,985
They're no danger to me.

302
00:17:59,069 --> 00:18:01,404
Where's the Anti-magic boy?

303
00:18:01,488 --> 00:18:04,282
Hiding in the severed magic?

304
00:18:04,366 --> 00:18:06,368
He's approaching
from my blind spot!

305

[BOTH yelling]

306
00:18:09,371 --> 00:18:10,538

That's all I've got.

00:18:25,512 --> 00:18:27,055
No, Asta!

314
00:18:35,689 --> 00:18:38,400
[CHARLOTTE] His level of
concentration is astounding!

315
00:18:38,483 --> 00:18:41,778
But there's no way he'll
succeed from this distance!

316
00:18:46,157 --> 00:18:48,410
[YAMI]
You sure about this?

317
00:18:48,493 --> 00:18:49,619
Putting a foreigner like me

318
00:18:49,703 --> 00:18:52,372
in charge of a
Magic Knights squad?

319
00:18:52,455 --> 00:18:55,208
[JULIUS] Don't worry.
I'm sure you'll do fine.

320
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:58,086
I mean, I'm sure I'll
do things my own way,

321
00:18:58,169 --> 00:18:59,379
and I know some
of the higher-ups

322
00:18:59,462 --> 00:19:01,256
won't be thrilled about it.

323
00:19:01,339 --> 00:19:04,300
Yeah, my magic's kinda
rare and all, but still--

324
00:19:04,384 --> 00:19:06,469
[JULIUS]
I know that.

325
00:19:06,553 --> 00:19:11,474
Yami. I've watched
you for a while.

326
00:19:11,558 --> 00:19:15,145
Trust me. You can
handle the job.

327
00:19:33,163 --> 00:19:37,792
[YAMI]
Mana Zone!

328
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:43,423
Dark Cloaked:
Dimension Slash, Equinox!

329
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:58,563
[KOTODAMA DEVIL sputters]

330
00:19:58,646 --> 00:20:00,357
[ALL gasp]

331
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,069
[KOTODAMA DEVIL]
Dark Magic can interfere

332
00:20:04,152 --> 00:20:07,530
with the other world!
Curse that human!

333
00:20:07,614 --> 00:20:09,491
[ASTA]
I know that ki!

334
00:20:09,574 --> 00:20:12,327
Captain Yami.

335
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:17,791
[KOTODAMA DEVIL cackles]

336
00:20:19,376 --> 00:20:21,503
I'll end you!

337
00:20:25,298 --> 00:20:27,175
[SECRÉ]
Sealing Recovery Magic:

338
00:20:27,258 --> 00:20:30,261
Heavenly Prison, Faint Omen.

339
00:20:31,554 --> 00:20:33,223
[SECRÉ]
I've sealed his physical damage.

340
00:20:33,306 --> 00:20:37,185
Now he just needs to draw out
his Anti-magic power!

341
00:20:37,268 --> 00:20:38,645
Asta!

342
00:20:38,728 --> 00:20:42,565
[KOTODAMA DEVIL]
Die! Perish!

343
00:20:42,649 --> 00:20:45,944
Disappear!

344
00:20:46,027 --> 00:20:48,738
[yells]

345
00:20:48,822 --> 00:20:51,950
You first!

346
00:20:52,033 --> 00:20:56,204
[KOTODAMA DEVIL screams]

347
00:20:56,287 --> 00:21:00,750
[KOTODAMA DEVIL yells]
You're nothing but trash!

348
00:21:00,834 --> 00:21:02,168
[SECRÉ]
Asta.

349
00:21:04,254 --> 00:21:05,005
[SECRÉ]
Remember.

350
00:21:05,088 --> 00:21:06,339
[gasps]

351
00:21:27,569 --> 00:21:30,864
You're going to be
the Wizard King!

352
00:21:32,532 --> 00:21:33,992
Yeah!

353
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:44,711
[ASTA]
Right here, right now.

354
00:21:44,794 --> 00:21:48,048
I'm going to push
past my limits!

355
00:21:49,507 --> 00:21:52,552
[KOTODAMA DEVIL screams]

356
00:21:52,635 --> 00:21:54,554
[ASTA yells]

357
00:21:54,637 --> 00:21:59,684
[KOTODAMA DEVIL screaming]

358
00:21:59,768 --> 00:22:05,607
[ASTA yells]

359
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:08,485
[KOTODAMA DEVIL screams]

360
00:23:56,926 --> 00:23:58,595
[YUNO]
Asta. We did it!

361
00:23:58,678 --> 00:24:01,639
This is exactly why you're
the perfect rival for me!

362
00:24:01,723 --> 00:24:04,517
Wait, is the Shadow Palace
starting to crumble?

363
00:24:04,601 --> 00:24:07,604
<i>Black Clover</i> , Page 120: "Dawn."

364
00:24:07,687 --> 00:24:10,273
The battle ends and
a new morning comes!
