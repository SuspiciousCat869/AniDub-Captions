[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,416
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:24,750
[NARRATOR] All seemed
lost until a lone mage

00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:27,083
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:35,708
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:39,625
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:43,166
[NARRATOR] Vetto infiltrated
the Underwater Temple,

8
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,791
seeking the magic stone
that would help

9
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:47,958
the Eye of the Midnight Sun
destroy the Clover Kingdom.

10
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:50,083
One by one,
Asta and his comrades

11
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:52,500
fell victim to Vetto's
overwhelming power.

Put her down! Do it right now!

17

[NARRATOR]
However, Noelle faced Vetto

18
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:08,750
and confronted him with
everything she had

19
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:10,750
in order to protect
her companions.

20
00:01:10,833 --> 00:01:13,625
[NOELLE] I am Noelle Silva
of the Black Bulls,

21

by and watching

How's that?

29
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,625
[NARRATOR] At the time, it
appeared that Noelle's attack

30
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:51,208
had defeated Vetto,
but, regrettably,

31
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:53,916
the battle was far
from being concluded.

can to help the injured.

[SEKKE]
What's this?

44
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:35,041
I'm sensing a dreadful
mana emanating

45
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:36,750
from somewhere deep
in the ocean.

46
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:39,166
Could that beast have returned?

47
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,375
[SEKKE]
Ha, ha?

48
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:42,750
That power couldn't
come from a mere beast.

49
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:46,708
He's something even
stronger now--a monster!

[VANESSA]
What? This can't be good.

51
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:53,166
I've never felt mana
so threatening before.

52

Curious about Vetto's power?

53
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,541
It's incredible.

54
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:03,458
You must be confident,
to let that divert you.

55
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:05,541
Huh? Vetto?

56
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:08,208
[VANESSA] That's right,
the captain mentioned him.

57
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,208
One of the Third Eye,
the mightiest

58
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:12,208
in the Eye of the Midnight Sun.

59
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:14,291
To think he's the one who
invaded this place.

00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:17,458
[TEUKE] Contemplating
your fate, my dear?

61
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:19,875
Yes, you are destined
to wither away

right where you stand.

63

Now, I'll suck out your
delicious magic power!

And I'll enjoy
every second of it.

I hate to disappoint you.
But you're done.

on me to join them.

[TEUKE cackles]

68
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:41,791
[NOELLE] He seems...
different. More evil.

69
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:43,916
He's like something
out of the fairy tales

70

when I was a little girl.

[NOELLE'S GRANDMOTHER]
Once upon a time, long ago,

72
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:53,375
a clan of malicious fiends lived
here and haunted our world.

73
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:56,291
They wanted everything in it,
especially the magic,

74
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:58,000
to be theirs, and they would do

75
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:00,833
anything in their
power to get it.

76
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:02,666
The most formidable
of the fiends

77
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:06,000
turned into a demon. And,
wielding dark, forbidden spells,

78
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:11,000
he attempted to obliterate all
of humankind with his magic.

79
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:13,583
The one man who stood up
to fight this wickedness

80
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:16,791
went on to become our
very first Wizard King.

00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:43,375
Well, that was intense.

163
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:47,000
I depleted quite a bit
of my mana fighting him.

164
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,416
Time to replenish and head out.

165
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:58,583
Ah. There we go.

166
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:00,083
[VANESSA]
Hold tight.

167
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,291
[VETTO laughs]

168
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:07,875
Back for more, anti-magic brat?

169
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:11,708
I see you can stand,
but it will do you no good.

170
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:15,541
What use is a body in tatters
in the face of my true form?

171
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,583
I'll relish your destruction.

172
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,291
The mana whispers.

173
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,458
It urges me to plunge
you two insects

174
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:24,166
into the depths of pain
and utter despair!

175
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,541
[panting]

176
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:30,500
How can you even stand up
when you're so gravely injured?

177
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:32,041
[ASTA]
It was Kahono.

178
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:35,375
She used the last of her
strength to heal me a little.

179
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:36,666
[gasps]

180
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:42,125
[ASTA]
I could barely hear her.

181
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,166
[ASTA]
But it was enough.

182
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,666
I'm grateful.

183
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,000
[ASTA]
We have to take him down.

184
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:07,625
And then we'll find a way
to heal Kahono's throat,

185
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:08,916
and Kiato's leg, too!

186
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,041
[NOELLE]
What?

187
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:13,833
[ASTA]
He grew his arm back, didn't he?

188
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:17,583
Someone else has gotta know
that kind of magic, surely!

189
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,291
Hey, that reminds me.

190
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:22,666
That insane spell you
pulled off before--

191
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,375
it totally psyched me up!

192
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:25,625
Uh--

193
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:29,583
Heh. I always knew
you could do it.

194
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:32,833
You're just as amazing
as I thought you were.

195
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:34,875
Guess it's my turn now.

196
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:38,583
Asta...

197
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,541
[FINRAL] Nope, nope, nope, nope,
nope, nope, nope, nope!

198
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,916
What the heck are you thinking?

199
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,416
[FINRAL] Nope, nope, nope, nope,
nope, nope, nope, nope!

200
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,541
What the heck are you thinking?

201
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,583
"Guess it's my turn now"?

202
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,875
You're totally insane!

203
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:03,500
Just what exactly do
you plan to do here?

204
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:06,916
Have you not noticed you're
battling an actual monster?

205
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,666
I'll introduce you.

206
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:12,541
These three are the strongest
members of the Midnight Sun.

207
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,083
They're the strongest?

208
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:17,750
[LICHT] Indeed. Their power
surpasses my own,

209
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,875
especially when
it comes to battle.

210
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:21,875
They are the Third Eye.

211
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:23,708
And they're more
powerful than you?

212
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:26,625
So, Third Eye, huh?

213
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:28,000
[FINRAL]
Stronger than a Light mage?

214
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,541
He's got to be bluffing
about that, right?

215
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,583
[FINRAL]
But he wasn't bluffing at all.

216
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:35,791
This guy's got more power
pouring off him then Licht,

217
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,708
the leader of the Midnight Sun!

218
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,666
I doubt our whole group
would stand a chance now,

219
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,083
even working together!

220
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:45,208
He's taken everyone
down, one by one.

221
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,750
Swatted them all like
they were flies.

222
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:50,416
That's it. I'm getting out,
before it's too late.

223
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:58,666
[FINRAL groans]

224
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,000
[FINRAL]
I can't save them.

225
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:01,583
Might as well save myself.

226
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:04,375
If I don't escape,
we'll be wiped out for sure.

227
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:08,583
[VETTO] You're nothing--
just a pitiful urchin.

228
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:10,916
What could you ever hope
to achieve in this fight?

229
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,541
[ASTA]
Shut your mouth!

230
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:16,125
Don't get even cockier because
you grew an ugly third eye!

231
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:17,625
[FINRAL] Nope, nope, nope, nope,
nope, nope, nope, nope--

232
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:19,875
he's not being cocky,
he's just honest!

233
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:23,041
This guy has unbelievable
levels of magic power!

234
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,541
You're never gonna win this one!

235
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:28,916
You should escape while you
can! Don't think, just go!

236
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,666
[ASTA] What you said before,
about how my biggest

237
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,250
weakness is not knowing
when to give up.

238
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,458
[ASTA]
That's no weakness.

239
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:40,041
The way I see it, not giving up

240
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:41,916
is the strongest
weapon I've got!

241
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,750
And there's no way
I'm gonna quit before

242
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:46,583
my wish comes true,
do you understand me?

243
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:48,416
Not ever!

244
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:57,208
[VETTO cackles]

245
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:59,750
[VETTO] You would call your
death wish a weapon?

246
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:02,750
You'll soon find out how
useless it is against me.

247
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:05,416
I'll teach you
a valuable lesson.

248
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,000
Ignorant whelp.

249
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:10,708
You've never known despair like
what I am about to show you.

250
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:13,208
But before I delight
more in your pain,

251
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:16,875
I think I'll clean up some of
the trash lying around here.

252
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,291
You can't!

253
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,333
Mythical Beast Magic.

254
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:22,416
Stop! No!

255
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,666
[VETTO]
Llewerafs Revolc!

256
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,000
[BOTH gasp]

257
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:28,250
[gasps]

258
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,916
[gasps]

259
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:47,333
[VANESSA]
Oh, dear.

260
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,583
Could this furry fellow
be the notorious Vetto

261
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,625
the captain has
told us all about?

262
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:54,083
It seems highly likely.

263
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:56,125
But you're much more
brutish and uglier

264
00:15:56,208 --> 00:16:00,208
than I imagined.
Not really my type, sorry.

265
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:04,041
--[NOELLE] Vanessa!
--[ASTA] Vanessa, yay!

266
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,333
[VANESSA]
You know, I would've been

267
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:09,125
way better off getting
dead drunk today.

268
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:11,333
And as for you,
over there, kiddo.

269
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:14,083
You're even more
reckless than I thought.

270
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:15,750
And yet...

271
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:18,166
I'm here now solely
because of your refusal

272
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,541
to give up the fight.

273
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:21,541
Time for me to hitch a ride
on this train of yours,

274
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:23,375
don'tcha think?

275
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:25,458
Great timing!

276
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:27,000
[VANESSA] I finally
understand why everyone

277
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:29,041
in the Black Bulls
had their eyes on you.

278
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:33,875
Makes perfect sense.
Isn't that right, Captain?

279
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,833
[YAMI]
It's the damn truth, kid.

280
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:38,000
Just like Vanessa said.

281
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:41,291
You refused to give up,
and because of that...

282
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:47,708
Noelle, Gauche,
Magna, and Luck...

283
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:51,000
They all managed to push
past their own limits.

284
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:53,333
For that matter, so did I.

285
00:16:55,750 --> 00:17:00,125
[VETTO] Hm. You think that being
persistent is enough to win?

286
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:03,375
Pitiful.

287
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:08,458
[VETTO] As if these cobwebs
could restrain me! Please.

288
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:11,333
You can't trap a Mythical Beast!

289
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:14,791
What fun would it be if you
actually stayed tied up?

290
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:16,125
[VETTO]
Keep talking.

291
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:19,041
Your confidence will
disappear quickly enough.

292
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:23,083
You're just one more
insect for me to destroy!

293
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:27,791
Mythical Beast Magic:
Epohlla Puevig!

294
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:29,375
[ASTA]
I'm too late!

295
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:38,666
It appears there was one
more mouse on the loose.

296
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,541
[FINRAL]
Aw, hey, wouldja look at that?

297
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:44,333
You guys sure are
on fire today, huh?

298
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:46,083
Finral, you're here!

299
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,833
Oh, my!

300
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:50,083
[FINRAL] Our juniors are
giving it all they've got.

301
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:52,708
Time for us to show off
our most advanced stuff.

302
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:55,250
[FINRAL]
No! What now? I'm toast!

303
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:58,166
What am I even
doing here? I'll die!

304
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:01,791
How nice of you to finally
show up, Finral,

305
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:03,583
you old incompetent so-and-so!

306
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,916
Hey! Who are you
calling incompetent?

307
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,583
Of course I'd show up, what do
you think I am, a coward?

308
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:09,833
[FINRAL]
Don't give up! Don't give up!

309
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:11,333
Don't give up! Don't give up!

310
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:14,666
[VETTO chuckles]
These little mice.

311
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,708
No, they're not even worth that!

312
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:19,708
More like a swarm
of pitiful ants. Ha.

313
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:22,166
They can't even hope to
inflict the tiniest scratch

314
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,208
upon the likes of me.

315
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:25,541
Right, Noelle.

316
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:27,583
Do you still have enough
magic to protect everyone?

317
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,291
Uh. Yeah!

318
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:30,958
[VANESSA]
Then I'll leave you to it.

319
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:33,625
[VANESSA]
My goodness.

320
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:36,791
That's a stunning amount
of magic. Daunting.

321
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:38,041
[laughs nervously]

322
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:39,541
You're right about that.

323
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:41,541
You can't see it,
though, can you?

324
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:44,250
Well, no, I can't
actually see it.

325
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,666
But, I can definitely
feel his ki.

326
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,708
[VANESSA] You sustain one
direct hit from this guy,

327
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:51,041
and that's it. You're
down for the count.

328
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:52,916
[FINRAL whines]
We're starting this fight

329
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,333
with our backs to the wall!

330
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:56,291
I'm not saying that
I'm gonna cry, but...

331
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:58,125
I just might!

332
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:01,041
If you help us win this,
I'll give you a nice, long hug.

333
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:02,000
A hug?

334
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:03,250
[VANESSA]
Oh, you heard me.

335
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:06,125
I'll let you cry into
my bosom all you want.

336
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:07,375
Now you're talkin'!

337
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:09,000
[grunting]

338
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:10,666
[ASTA] Finral's ki just
went through the roof--

339
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,375
that's amazing!

340
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:13,750
Men are so predictable.

341
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:17,083
They're easy as pie to control.
Now, listen, Asta.

342
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:19,166
The usual magic attacks
aren't gonna do any good

343
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,291
against this guy.

344
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:23,625
It's going to be up to you
and your anti-magic.

345
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:26,666
Whatever happens, do not
let go of that sword.

346
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:27,833
[ASTA]
Ma'am!

347
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:30,416
All right, boys,
our lives depend on this.

348
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,375
You bet. Let's beat him!

349
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:35,125
We're not about to
let you die, Asta.

350
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,333
We'll be fighting beside you!

351
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:39,041
[VETTO laughs]

352
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,208
[NOELLE]
Good luck, all of you!

353
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:56,000
Mythical Beast Magic.

354
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:57,666
[ALL]
Let's do this!

355
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:01,500
[VETTO]
Epohlla Puevig!

356
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,625
[yells]

357
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:12,125
[ASTA yells]

358
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:14,875
[VETTO] I assumed the anti-magic
blade would slice through

359
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:17,583
my long-range attacks,
but the Spatial mage

360
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,666
is sending them
right back at me.

361
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:23,125
Springing quickly into action
with remarkable accuracy.

362
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,333
Not bad for mere humans.

363
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:26,916
[FINRAL]
I'm so scared!

364
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,791
But I have no choice!
I have to fight!

365
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:31,708
[VETTO]
In that case,

366
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:33,875
I'll have to take you
on at close range!

367
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:36,875
[yelling]

368
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:39,000
[laughs]

369
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,916
[VETTO]
Nice try, brat!

370
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:49,125
[VETTO] But the Spatial
spell's power and your aura

371
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:51,625
give away your every move!

372
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:57,166
[VETTO]
What?

373
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:01,291
[VETTO]
The thread's trajectory shifted.

374
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:04,958
You insects and your
useless scurrying about!

375
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:18,875
[yelling]

376
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:21,916
[yells]

377
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:28,208
[ASTA]
This is my weapon.

378
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:31,041
Now watch. I will defeat you!

379
00:23:02,541 --> 00:23:04,208
[FULL CAST]
Clover Clips!

380
00:23:06,541 --> 00:23:08,875
[FINRAL]
"Bonus Magic."

381
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:11,541
Ooh, what is that?
It sounds awesome!

382
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:12,833
Well, like the name implies,

383
00:23:12,916 --> 00:23:14,625
it's magic that gives
you a little extra.

384
00:23:14,708 --> 00:23:16,625
Now whaddaya say
I give it a whirl?

385
00:23:16,708 --> 00:23:17,666
Yes, please!

386
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:19,333
That furry beast-guy
Vetto has gotten

387
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:21,791
more than his fair share of
screen time, if you ask me,

388
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:23,791
so how about a little
change of pace?

389
00:23:23,875 --> 00:23:25,916
[FINRAL]
Okay, here goes.

390
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,625
[ASTA]
So, this is bonus magic...

391
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:32,125
Oh, hey, I wonder
how Mimosa's doing?

392
00:23:32,208 --> 00:23:34,458
[FINRAL]
Woo-hoo! It worked perfectly!

393
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:36,791
Oh, man, curves in
all the right places,

394
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:37,916
you know what I'm sayin'?

395
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,541
You guys are the Babes of...

396
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:41,416
What the heck is going
on here, Dorksta?

397
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,125
You stupid jerk, How could you?!

398
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:44,958
--What are you even thinking?
--[ASTA] It was him!

399
00:23:46,416 --> 00:23:48,541
[VANESSA] We're joining
forces to defeat Vetto!

400
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:50,583
Finral and I give Asta
a helping hand.

401
00:23:50,666 --> 00:23:53,916
I think you can do it, kiddo.
No, I know you can!

402
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,625
<i>Black Clover</i> , Page 48:
"Despair vs. Hope."

403
00:23:57,708 --> 00:24:00,125
Our magic is never giving up!
