[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

until a lone mage

stepped forward and
took up the fight.

After his triumph, he was hailed

the intrusion, sir!

It's Kiten, the border

Diamond Kingdom.

I've never heard of them before!

[YAMI] They're the eight
most powerful people

in the whole Diamond Kingdom.

You might think of them
as being kinda like

23
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:16,625
our Magic Knight captains.

24

One squad rushed to Kiten's aid

additional backup.

[ASTA]
Okay, Yuno. I'm coming!

By the time we're done,

35
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:50,458
those Diamond Kingdom

ever setting foot
in our country.

Well, aren't you a couple
of gorgeous ladies?

38
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:34,166
There's a hill nearby where
some beautiful flowers grow.

00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,416
Kinda creepy.

162
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,416
He's got his grimoire open,

163
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,041
so I assume he's using
magic of some sort, but...

164
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:33,458
All I see is what looks
like a bunch of tree roots.

165
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:37,750
[LOTUS]
Maybe he's gonna grow a tree?

166
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:39,583
That's a peaceful thing to do.

167
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,333
Must be nice to have
strong enough magic

168
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:44,000
to make something that
protects a whole village.

169
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:47,583
[LOTUS gasps]

170
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,916
[LOTUS]
Is he absorbing people's magic?

171
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:56,875
[LOTUS] Why am I always
the one to notice things?

172
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:59,958
Listen, you three!
This is Lotus!

173
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:02,208
The enemy captain from
the Golden Dawn seems

174
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:05,958
to be preparing to launch
a large-scale magic attack.

175
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:09,333
Its range will span
all of Kiten, at least.

176
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:12,291
I repeat. Look at their captain!

177
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:14,708
[LOTUS]
Great, they're not listening.

178
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:17,250
I guess I should run, then.

this Golden Dawn guy have?

[WILLIAM] World Tree Magic:
Great Mistilteinn Tree.

All for the good
of the Clover Kingdom.

[ASTA]
So, this is Kiten? Wait.

188
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:27,166
[ASTA] Why's there a giant
tree in the middle of it?

189
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,750
How'd they build their
whole town around that?

190
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:31,333
[CHARMY]
I bet it grows giant fruit, too!

I've heard enough
outta you two idiots.

Hm. Looks like Goldiguts's work.

[ASTA]
Huh? You mean this is a spell?

194
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,458
[YAMI] Seems like they've
got it covered.

[FINRAL] Oh, good! Then we
can go back now, right?

Nah. I wanna see
how the fight's goin'.

Huh?

[YAMI]
I'm guessin' the captain's

199
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:52,541
at the top of the tree.

200
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,375
I'm gonna head up now.

201
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:55,958
You go help the civilians.

is this gonna take?

Before we do anything,

I gotta get some of that fruit!

injured, and Charmy's...

Well, she's just Charmy.

[WILLIAM]
Goodness.

212
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:27,166
It appears there was a
massive amount of power

213
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,541
on the battlefield.

214
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:32,541
Fortunately, I think
this cleared most of it.

It's not a good look for you.

So, what brings
you to Kiten, Asta?

260
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:30,500
[FINRAL] That guy joined the
Magic Knights when Asta did.

261
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:32,416
And why are you
scrambling around looking

262
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,416

covered in sweat?

So gross.

[FINRAL] He worked his way up
to the Golden Dawn elite?

265

A guy like him makes the
Black Bulls look wimpy.

Bet he's popular, too.

If you got those injuries
while fighting someone,

like I think you did,

270

you got stronger again.

elite, with good looks

for days, and his magic
ability's off the charts?

281
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,875
But he's competing
with Asta, a member

282
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:30,333
of the Black Bulls who's a
total meathead with no magic?

make pretty good rivals.

But what happened to your arms?

Let's see, does it hurt
when I do this?

Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

291
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:52,708
Of course, I didn't
ask you that because

292
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:55,458
I'm worried or anything.

293
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,791
You should have never
let your guard down.

probably take care

been so forward!

Please forgive me!

You two should stay
together for now.

I'm sure it's difficult
to fight without your arms.

00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,375
Not that I'm coddling
you or anything!

308
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:32,750
You can leave now.

Well, well, well.

So that's where you were.

00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:58,375
You must be the
Golden Dawn's captain.

316
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:00,375
I underestimated you.

This is some serious
magic power you've got.

Yes, and I could say the
same about you, as well.

00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:08,958
You shouldn't die in vain.

320
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:11,666
Take your comrades
and leave this land.

321
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,958
What did you say to me?

322
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:19,375
Diamond soldiers don't retreat,
no matter the circumstance!

323
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:22,041
Never!

324
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:24,333
Red Clay Creation Magic:

325
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:28,416
Brilliant Armor,
Heavy Artillery!

326
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,250
That was pathetic!

327
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,416
Was that supposed to be painful?

328
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,541
[laughs]

329
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:36,750
[BROCKS]
Let me guess.

330
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:40,041
You've already run out of magic!

331
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:41,666
Good!

332
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:49,666
[WILLIAM] World Tree Magic:
Mistilteinn Seed.

333
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:53,375
You should be honored, you know.

334
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:55,666
Your magic is being used
for the nourishment

335
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,625
of the Clover Kingdom.

336
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:03,750
[WILLIAM]
It's an ambush!

337
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:06,083
He must have
concealed his power!

338
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:09,708
[WILLIAM]
Yami!

339
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:13,500
That's my name. Good to
see ya, Featherface.

340
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:15,041
[LOTUS]
Ouch!

341
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:17,208
I thought I could turn
things around if I bagged

342
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:20,791
the Golden Dawn captain,
but I guess not.

343
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:26,041
[LOTUS]
Who could have expected

344
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:28,541
I'd have to fight
this guy again?

345
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:32,625
And he's even stronger
than the last time!

346
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:36,291
Kinda makes me feel
like a pitiful old man.

347
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,416
Think this means you owe me one.

348
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,666
Vangeance.

349
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,166
[WILLIAM]
Thank you for saving me.

350
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:46,750
So, you read his ki. Impressive.

351
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:49,666
Hey. Old Diamond guy
I don't know.

352
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,291
You ready to surrender now?

353
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:55,875
Aw. Come on! You forgot?

354
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:57,208
Here, look.

355
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:59,875
I'm not interested in your
nasty man-chest, pal!

356
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:01,083
I'll cut you down!

357
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,125
[LOTUS]
Harsh!

358
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:05,708
You wanna fight? Come at me!

359
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:08,708
This is a tricky
situation for me.

360
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,083
Which means...

361
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:12,875
I should handle it
the Diamond way.

362
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,250
[LOTUS]
Retreat!

363
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,916
Well, he's decisive. Good.

364
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:32,041
Now, that's done.

365
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:36,166
The view's pretty nice up here
and it's just the two of us.

366
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:39,291
How about we have a little chat?

367
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:41,083
You got time?

368
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:45,083
[YAMI]
Y'know.

369
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:46,750
It takes some serious
strength to pull off

370
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:49,541
a spell like this one.

371
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:54,083
[WILLIAM] Please, it's only
possible thanks to my enemies.

372
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:56,791
[YAMI]
So. World Tree Magic.

373
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:59,416
Is that the only kind
you've got? Nothin' else?

374
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:04,125
[WILLIAM] I'm sorry.
What are you implying, Yami?

375
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:08,916
Well, I'm the kinda guy who
goes with his gut instinct.

376
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:13,750
[YAMI]
Vangeance. If you don't mind.

377
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:17,166
Lose the mask.

378
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:57,000

full of diehard Charmy
Pappitson fans out there.

382
00:23:08,708 --> 00:23:10,125
We're going to
answer your prayers

383
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:12,291
and show you all the
adorable Charmy moments

384
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:13,750

385
00:23:13,833 --> 00:23:15,583

Finally, number six!

392
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:42,083
So cool!

393
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:43,958
I thought there were seven.

394
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,208
[YUNO]
Did you see that, Asta?

395
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:51,333
I've gotten incredibly strong
since the last time we met.

396
00:23:51,416 --> 00:23:55,000
I won't lose to you in strength,
good looks, or in height!

become the Wizard King!
