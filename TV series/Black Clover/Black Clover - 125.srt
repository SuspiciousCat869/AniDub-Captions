1
00:00:22,303 --> 00:00:23,930
[NARRATOR]
The Clover Kingdom.

2
00:00:24,014 --> 00:00:26,349
In this place where
magic is everything,

3
00:00:26,433 --> 00:00:29,310
there lives one boy
who was born without it.

4
00:00:29,394 --> 00:00:31,688
His name is Asta.

5
00:00:32,856 --> 00:00:34,315
[NARRATOR]
His strength and determination

6
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,651
helped him become
a Magic Knight.

7
00:00:36,735 --> 00:00:39,279
And despite the many
challenges he faces,

8
00:00:39,362 --> 00:00:43,116
he aims for the top
and refuses to give up!

9
00:00:43,199 --> 00:00:44,784
Rich or poor,

10
00:00:44,868 --> 00:00:46,911
royalty or commoner,

11
00:00:46,995 --> 00:00:49,789
Asta believes anyone can shine.

12
00:00:49,873 --> 00:00:52,792
His mission is to prove
that to the whole world

13
00:00:52,876 --> 00:00:55,795
and to become the
next Wizard King!

14
00:00:57,839 --> 00:00:59,758
[NARRATOR] After the chaos
in the royal capital

15
00:00:59,841 --> 00:01:01,718
had finally died down,

16
00:01:01,801 --> 00:01:04,137
Asta and the Black Bulls
were headed back home.

17
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,806
[laughing] Look alive,
knuckleheads.

18
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:08,933
It's not that much farther now!

19
00:01:11,102 --> 00:01:12,854
After all the crazy
stuff that's happened,

20
00:01:12,937 --> 00:01:15,023
it feels like we haven't
been home in forever!

21
00:01:15,106 --> 00:01:16,483
Yeah, I know!

22
00:01:16,566 --> 00:01:18,818
Maybe I can have at least
one day to work out in peace

23
00:01:18,902 --> 00:01:21,196
before we get
another job to do!

24
00:01:21,279 --> 00:01:24,157
And that's peaceful to you?

25
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,077
Huh? Hey... look!

26
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,120
Almost... there!

27
00:01:29,204 --> 00:01:32,749
[BLACK BULL BEASTS growling]

28
00:03:04,466 --> 00:03:07,135
Aw, yeah! We're finally home!

29
00:03:07,218 --> 00:03:08,720
Hey, Henry!

30
00:03:08,803 --> 00:03:12,140
Hurry up and switch this puppy
back to the way it was before!

31
00:03:12,223 --> 00:03:14,642
[HENRY]
Hm...

32
00:03:14,726 --> 00:03:16,561
What's the holdup, Henry?

33
00:03:16,644 --> 00:03:18,313
Is something wrong?

34
00:03:18,396 --> 00:03:19,689
You gassy?

35
00:03:19,773 --> 00:03:23,026
What does... the
hideout... look like?

36
00:03:23,109 --> 00:03:26,154
I can't... remember!

37
00:03:26,237 --> 00:03:28,615
[BLACK BULLS]
What?!

38
00:03:28,698 --> 00:03:30,575
This guy's a freakin' riot.

39
00:03:30,658 --> 00:03:31,743
[MAGNA]
What the hell?

40
00:03:31,826 --> 00:03:33,995
Didn't you live here
longer than anybody?

41
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,413
I'll walk you through it.

42
00:03:35,497 --> 00:03:37,207
First you come in and there's
the living room, right?

43
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,751
Then after that is...

44
00:03:39,834 --> 00:03:41,461
You explain it to him, Asta!

45
00:03:41,544 --> 00:03:42,712
What? Who, me?

46
00:03:42,796 --> 00:03:44,923
No! I'm clueless here!

47
00:03:45,006 --> 00:03:46,925
Next is my shrine to Marie.

48
00:03:47,008 --> 00:03:48,760
Actually, I'm pretty sure
it was a giant pantry

49
00:03:48,843 --> 00:03:50,804
with snacks from all
over the kingdom in it!

50
00:03:50,887 --> 00:03:52,889
Nah, it was the sauna.

51
00:03:52,972 --> 00:03:55,058
[ASTA]
Whoa, where did you guys live?

52
00:03:55,141 --> 00:03:56,601
But, maybe we did
have a snack cabinet

53
00:03:56,685 --> 00:03:58,144
and a sauna and a
weird sister shrine...

54
00:03:58,228 --> 00:04:00,021
[NOELLE] To be fair, the rooms
were always shifting around,

55
00:04:00,105 --> 00:04:02,941
so it's kind of difficult
to picture what went where.

56
00:04:03,024 --> 00:04:04,275
[HENRY]
Well...

57
00:04:04,359 --> 00:04:08,697
You guys... kept...
breaking everything!

58
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,407
Thanks for the years
of free home repairs,

59
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:13,034
but you didn't have to randomly
change the whole floor plan!

60
00:04:13,118 --> 00:04:14,494
Without the help
of my Spatial Magic,

61
00:04:14,577 --> 00:04:16,204
Captain Yami would've
never found his way

62
00:04:16,287 --> 00:04:17,455
to the little boy's room!

63
00:04:17,539 --> 00:04:18,957
Think of all the
awkward situations

64
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,709
that could've been avoided!

65
00:04:20,792 --> 00:04:23,211
Sorry... everyone.

66
00:04:23,294 --> 00:04:24,629
[ASTA]
Hey!

67
00:04:24,713 --> 00:04:26,047
Why don't we tell Henry
everything we want in a hideout,

68
00:04:26,131 --> 00:04:27,632
and then he can put
all of our ideas together

69
00:04:27,716 --> 00:04:28,758
and make this
building the coolest,

70
00:04:28,842 --> 00:04:30,885
comfiest place
in the whole kingdom?

71
00:04:30,969 --> 00:04:33,096
Yeah, Asta, that's
a killer idea!

72
00:04:33,179 --> 00:04:34,848
[BOTH]
Sounds like a plan to me!

73
00:04:34,931 --> 00:04:37,517
[laughs] As long as
I can enjoy my drinks

74
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,102
in the new place, I'm in!

75
00:04:39,185 --> 00:04:41,104
You're shooting for
the moon, aren't you?

76
00:04:41,187 --> 00:04:42,188
[whispering] Home
is the place where

77
00:04:42,272 --> 00:04:44,107
the greatest of
friendships are forged!

78
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,317
All right, you morons
knock yourselves out.

79
00:04:46,401 --> 00:04:48,194
[BOTH]
We'll do that, sir!

80
00:04:48,278 --> 00:04:50,447
[ASTA]
We're countin' on you, Henry!

81
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:53,366
Leave it... to me!

82
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:55,076
Everybody take one!

83
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,662
Write all the stuff you
want on these forms!

84
00:04:57,746 --> 00:04:59,956
Oh! Can't forget you two!

85
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,999
[ZORA]
Ugh.

86
00:05:01,082 --> 00:05:03,168
There's always a
"thing" with you.

87
00:05:12,093 --> 00:05:13,428
[HENRY]
Wow...

88
00:05:13,511 --> 00:05:15,555
[NOELLE]
He seems overwhelmed.

89
00:05:15,638 --> 00:05:17,974
Do you think we maybe
asked too much of him?

90
00:05:18,058 --> 00:05:20,185
My request was for the
hideout to be relocated

91
00:05:20,268 --> 00:05:23,021
so it's right next to the
church where Marie lives.

92
00:05:23,104 --> 00:05:26,649
[MARIE] This is great!
Now I can see you every day!

93
00:05:26,733 --> 00:05:27,650
Oh, Marie!

94
00:05:27,734 --> 00:05:29,277
I can't wait to
be your neighbor!

95
00:05:29,361 --> 00:05:31,279
I am not too picky,
as long as I get to be

96
00:05:31,363 --> 00:05:32,697
in the same room
as all my friends

97
00:05:32,781 --> 00:05:34,783
every second of every day!

98
00:05:34,866 --> 00:05:36,493
[GREY] I've reached the
pinnacle of embarrassment,

99
00:05:36,576 --> 00:05:39,079
so I want a place where
I can hide away forever!

100
00:05:39,162 --> 00:05:40,789
If I can be surrounded
by dark curtains,

101
00:05:40,872 --> 00:05:42,290
I'll be more than happy, okay?

102
00:05:42,374 --> 00:05:43,541
My dream is to live

103
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,043
where I'm allowed to eat
ten full meals a day!

104
00:05:45,126 --> 00:05:46,795
Yeah, you already do that.

105
00:05:46,878 --> 00:05:49,214
Hey, how about we throw
in an open bar, too?

106
00:05:49,297 --> 00:05:50,256
[meows]

107
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,925
[NOELLE]
I'm surrounded by idiots.

108
00:05:52,008 --> 00:05:53,426
Hey, guess what?

109
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,553
I requested a room that's right
next door to yours, Magna!

110
00:05:55,637 --> 00:05:57,472
Which means that, if I
use my magic detection,

111
00:05:57,555 --> 00:05:58,848
I'll always be able to
tell what you're doing

112
00:05:58,932 --> 00:06:00,308
on the other side of the wall!

113
00:06:00,392 --> 00:06:01,643
I can't wait to mess with you!

114
00:06:01,726 --> 00:06:03,311
I'll knock your teeth out!

115
00:06:03,395 --> 00:06:04,604
Go on and try!

116
00:06:04,688 --> 00:06:06,481
[MAGNA] Oh! Say that again,
you little twerp!

117
00:06:06,564 --> 00:06:07,732
[LUCK laughs]

118
00:06:07,816 --> 00:06:10,068
[NOELLE]
Who'll be next to me?

119
00:06:10,151 --> 00:06:12,112
I guess if Nero gets moved
into a different room,

120
00:06:12,195 --> 00:06:13,822
then she can't
wake me up anymore.

121
00:06:13,905 --> 00:06:14,906
I was only pecking you

122
00:06:14,989 --> 00:06:16,741
so you would stop
snoring so loudly.

123
00:06:16,825 --> 00:06:17,617
[NOELLE]
Hey, wait!

124
00:06:17,701 --> 00:06:18,910
When Nero was in her bird form,

125
00:06:18,993 --> 00:06:21,162
she used to sleep in
the same room as Asta!

126
00:06:21,246 --> 00:06:22,414
I mean, to be fair,

127
00:06:22,497 --> 00:06:23,832
he didn't know she was
a cute girl back then!

128
00:06:23,915 --> 00:06:25,875
She just perched on
the windowsill, right?

129
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:28,795
Ugh! Why do I even
care in the first place?

130
00:06:28,878 --> 00:06:30,672
Um...

131
00:06:30,755 --> 00:06:33,091
[ASTA] Henry's really giving
this a lot of thought, huh?

132
00:06:33,174 --> 00:06:35,510
[NOELLE]
Well, it's important!

133
00:06:35,593 --> 00:06:37,178
[YAMI]
All right, get back to work.

134
00:06:37,262 --> 00:06:38,763
What's all this stuff for?

135
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:41,433
You want us to go hunting
for bugs or somethin'?

136
00:06:41,516 --> 00:06:42,976
Of course not, you idiot.

137
00:06:43,059 --> 00:06:45,145
My adorable little pets used
to live here before our hideout

138
00:06:45,228 --> 00:06:46,855
got wrecked by the
Eye of the Midnight Sun,

139
00:06:46,938 --> 00:06:48,690
so now they're runnin' loose!

140
00:06:48,773 --> 00:06:51,192
Go track 'em down before
they cause trouble!

141
00:06:51,276 --> 00:06:52,027
[BLACK BULLS]
Sir!

142
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,862
I forgot about them!

143
00:06:53,945 --> 00:06:55,780
It's no big deal, though.
They got pretty used to me

144
00:06:55,864 --> 00:06:56,990
after I took care of 'em.

145
00:06:57,073 --> 00:06:58,366
I'm sure this is gonna
be a piece of cake!

146
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:00,201
[YAMI]
Don't count on that, kid.

147
00:07:00,285 --> 00:07:01,369
Huh?

148
00:07:01,453 --> 00:07:03,872
These woods are their backyard.

149
00:07:03,955 --> 00:07:06,958
They probably went feral again
after a couple of days.

150
00:07:07,042 --> 00:07:09,919
The second you let your guard
down, they'll eat you alive.

151
00:07:10,003 --> 00:07:11,504
Hang on, if they're that scary,

152
00:07:11,588 --> 00:07:14,716
how come you're sending me out
there with only this tiny net?

153
00:07:14,799 --> 00:07:17,093
Quit your panicking and
go get my pets back!

154
00:07:17,177 --> 00:07:19,137
[ASTA]
Okay!

155
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,014
[YAMI]
There are three magical beasts.

156
00:07:21,097 --> 00:07:23,308
If the rest of you
are bored, go help him!

157
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,434
[GROUP]
'Kay!

158
00:07:24,517 --> 00:07:26,186
Yes, sir! Yami, sir!

159
00:07:26,269 --> 00:07:28,938
It's gonna be so much fun to
spar with some magical beasts!

160
00:07:29,022 --> 00:07:31,107
If you lay even one finger
on my precious babies,

161
00:07:31,191 --> 00:07:32,817
I'll rip you limb from limb.

162
00:07:32,901 --> 00:07:34,402
Would you two leave me alone?

163
00:07:34,486 --> 00:07:35,653
I'm trying to have
a conversation

164
00:07:35,737 --> 00:07:37,197
with a photograph
of my little sister.

165
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,823
Our friend's counting on us!

166
00:07:38,907 --> 00:07:41,201
I hope this won't end
in total embarrassment.

167
00:07:41,284 --> 00:07:43,203
Are you listening to me?

168
00:07:43,286 --> 00:07:44,537
You guys ready to go?

169
00:07:44,621 --> 00:07:45,955
I think the three
of us should team up

170
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:47,957
since we're the squad rookies!

171
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:49,584
[BOTH]
If you say so.

172
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,047
Wait, wasn't Zora here
just a second ago?

173
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:57,467
[ZORA] No thanks.
I got better things to do.

174
00:07:58,468 --> 00:07:59,636
[YAMI]
Oh, well.

175
00:07:59,719 --> 00:08:01,388
That mask-wearing punk
can bail if he wants.

176
00:08:01,471 --> 00:08:03,765
I'll just punish him later.

177
00:08:03,848 --> 00:08:06,685
I've got an important
duty to attend to.

178
00:08:06,768 --> 00:08:09,354
I'm leaving this up to you guys.

179
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,987
Hey! Monsters!

180
00:08:18,071 --> 00:08:20,073
Where are you?

181
00:08:20,156 --> 00:08:22,492
Woof! Woof, woof, woof, woof!

182
00:08:22,575 --> 00:08:23,618
Meow. Meow...

183
00:08:23,702 --> 00:08:25,912
[NOELLE]
That's actually kind of cute.

184
00:08:27,872 --> 00:08:29,374
Do you really think
that's going to work?

185
00:08:29,457 --> 00:08:32,085
How stupid can you be?

186
00:08:32,168 --> 00:08:33,211
Don't forget.

187
00:08:33,294 --> 00:08:34,546
The captain said
they're probably feral,

188
00:08:34,629 --> 00:08:36,589
so if we act like bait,
we'll just get mauled!

189
00:08:36,673 --> 00:08:38,633
I know, but I was the one
who took care of them,

190
00:08:38,717 --> 00:08:39,968
so maybe they'll
come to their senses

191
00:08:40,051 --> 00:08:41,720
when they realize who I am!

192
00:08:41,803 --> 00:08:43,805
Come to think of it, Nero,
you were kinda like my pet

193
00:08:43,888 --> 00:08:45,015
back when you were
in your bird form,

194
00:08:45,098 --> 00:08:46,725
so you understand what
I mean, don't ya?

195
00:08:46,808 --> 00:08:48,727
You shouldn't patronize me.

196
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:52,188
In my bird form, I was watching
over your grimoire, not you.

197
00:08:52,272 --> 00:08:56,317
If you ask me, you were the pet.

198
00:08:56,401 --> 00:08:59,029
[NOELLE] They say the more
you argue, the closer you are.

199
00:08:59,112 --> 00:09:01,281
I mean, not that it makes
any difference to me!

200
00:09:01,364 --> 00:09:04,367
I only came along because
I had no choice in the matter!

201
00:09:04,451 --> 00:09:05,910
What's that ki I'm sensing?

202
00:09:05,994 --> 00:09:07,078
What? Um.

203
00:09:07,162 --> 00:09:08,413
I don't know,
but there was no way

204
00:09:08,496 --> 00:09:09,748
I was thinking about you two!

205
00:09:09,831 --> 00:09:11,416
--[ASTA] Found ya!
--Asta!

206
00:09:11,499 --> 00:09:13,668
[yells]

207
00:09:13,752 --> 00:09:16,004
Hey, what's a flock of
anti-birds doing here?

208
00:09:16,087 --> 00:09:17,797
They're about to
peck me to death!

209
00:09:17,881 --> 00:09:22,302
They must be angry
because you're so noisy.

210
00:09:22,385 --> 00:09:24,804
I'll see if I can locate
them from the sky.

211
00:09:24,888 --> 00:09:27,098
[ASTA]
Save me!

212
00:09:27,182 --> 00:09:28,641
[NOELLE]
Maybe I'm worried about nothing.

213
00:09:28,725 --> 00:09:30,977
Kind of seems like
they hate each other.

214
00:09:31,061 --> 00:09:31,895
[gasps]

215
00:09:31,978 --> 00:09:34,397
Wait, we're alone now?

216
00:09:34,481 --> 00:09:36,566
Man, this place
is friggin' creepy.

217
00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:39,402
[LUCK laughs]
What's the matter? Ya scared?

218
00:09:39,486 --> 00:09:41,696
What are you talking
about? I'm not scared!

219
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,115
Just shut your yap, and put
some pep in your step!

220
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,868
Hey, I told you to hurry--

221
00:09:46,951 --> 00:09:48,953
Uh...

222
00:09:49,037 --> 00:09:50,789
[MAGNA] That little snot
probably hid somewhere

223
00:09:50,872 --> 00:09:53,833
so he could go "boo!"
and try to spook me.

224
00:09:53,917 --> 00:09:57,754
Don't bother, small fry!
I'll make you regret this!

225
00:10:01,716 --> 00:10:02,842
[MAGNA]
Ha!

226
00:10:02,926 --> 00:10:04,719
Did you think an
amateur move like that

227
00:10:04,803 --> 00:10:05,804
would actually work on me?

228
00:10:05,887 --> 00:10:06,638
Boo!

229
00:10:06,721 --> 00:10:09,641
[MAGNA screams]

230
00:10:09,724 --> 00:10:13,645
[LUCK laughs] My "scare and
shock" plan was a huge success!

231
00:10:13,728 --> 00:10:15,897
Oh! I'mma kill you!

232
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,774
I don't know,
are you sure you can?

233
00:10:17,857 --> 00:10:20,026
Well, there's nobody out here
to make us stop fighting,

234
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:22,779
so feel free to come at me
with everything you've got!

235
00:10:22,862 --> 00:10:24,572
Oh, I wouldn't say
that if I were you.

236
00:10:24,656 --> 00:10:25,865
Things have changed,
and you and I

237
00:10:25,949 --> 00:10:28,785
are on totally different
levels these days!

238
00:10:28,868 --> 00:10:30,328
That's for damn sure.

239
00:10:30,412 --> 00:10:33,540
You may not know this, but I
developed unbelievable strength

240
00:10:33,623 --> 00:10:36,501
after our battle when
you were possessed!

241
00:10:36,584 --> 00:10:37,502
Oh, really?

242
00:10:37,585 --> 00:10:39,379
That makes two of us, then!

243
00:10:39,462 --> 00:10:41,006
The mana's calling to me.

244
00:10:41,089 --> 00:10:43,258
I haven't sparred
with you in ages,

245
00:10:43,341 --> 00:10:46,344
so I'll probably have too much
fun and get carried away!

246
00:10:46,428 --> 00:10:48,388
What are you waiting for?

247
00:10:50,682 --> 00:10:53,393
Oh, gosh! What was
that loud sound?

248
00:10:53,476 --> 00:10:54,811
Magna and Luck.

249
00:10:54,894 --> 00:10:57,647
I think they're reigniting
their fiery friendship!

250
00:10:57,731 --> 00:10:59,149
Who gives a crap?

251
00:10:59,232 --> 00:11:00,358
And you two!

252
00:11:00,442 --> 00:11:01,901
How long do you plan on
cowering behind me?

253
00:11:01,985 --> 00:11:03,153
Please pretend I'm not here!

254
00:11:03,236 --> 00:11:05,655
This whole situation
is so humiliating!

255
00:11:05,739 --> 00:11:07,282
Why didn't you just stay home?

256
00:11:07,365 --> 00:11:09,200
Well, I wanted to, but
there aren't any walls left

257
00:11:09,284 --> 00:11:10,702
to conceal my shame!

258
00:11:10,785 --> 00:11:12,537
[GAUCHE]
I'm not your damn wall!

259
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,456
[GORDON]
This forest is really scary,

260
00:11:14,539 --> 00:11:17,167
and we're not sure when the
magical beasts might attack!

261
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,919
Don't worry, your face is
the most terrifying thing here!

262
00:11:20,003 --> 00:11:21,338
Hey...

263
00:11:21,421 --> 00:11:24,049
[GREY] I wish you'd stop
making eye contact with me!

[BLACK BULL BEASTS growling]

265
00:11:27,218 --> 00:11:29,054
[GAUCHE]
Yep, there they are.

266
00:11:29,137 --> 00:11:30,764
The faster I wrangle
these monsters,

267
00:11:30,847 --> 00:11:33,725
the sooner I can visit
my sweet Marie!

268
00:11:33,808 --> 00:11:35,310
You ready, guys?

269
00:11:37,687 --> 00:11:39,147
Hey, what the hell
are you doing?!

270
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:41,191
I'm sorry, it's just that
they popped up out of nowhere,

271
00:11:41,274 --> 00:11:43,777
and it caused my embarrassment
to evolve into pure terror!

--[GAUCHE] Let go of me!
--But I can't do that.

to let you go!

274

Ugh, I can't believe
I got teamed up

with the two biggest

we should get back
to hunting soon?

it's a good idea!

out, he'd kill me for sure!

I'm sure the others already

any more snacks, Charmy?

of a manicure, ya know!

00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:28,882
You might get a step ahead,
but you'll never outdo me.

316
00:13:28,965 --> 00:13:30,759
I hope you're okay with that.

317
00:13:30,842 --> 00:13:32,260
My bad!

318
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:34,054
Sorry, I couldn't really
hear your big speech

319
00:13:34,137 --> 00:13:35,263
over all the growling.

320
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:38,141
Aw! Dammit, there's
always something!

321
00:13:38,224 --> 00:13:40,643
Just gimme a second to
recover my mana and stamina,

322
00:13:40,727 --> 00:13:42,395
and then I'll save
you, I promise.

323
00:13:42,479 --> 00:13:44,397
Okay, that sounds fair!

324
00:13:44,481 --> 00:13:46,107
Hey, don't eat me,
I'm the guy who used

325
00:13:46,191 --> 00:13:47,817
to take care of you
before Asta came along.

326
00:13:47,901 --> 00:13:49,361
Don't tell me you forgot
about me already!

327
00:13:49,444 --> 00:13:51,780
Come on, I swear I
don't taste very good!

328
00:13:51,863 --> 00:13:54,699
[MAGNA yells]

329
00:13:54,783 --> 00:13:57,285
[ASTA] Jeez, where
could those things be?

330
00:13:57,369 --> 00:14:00,580
Nero still hasn't
come back, either.

331
00:14:00,663 --> 00:14:04,084
[NOELLE] Being alone with
him makes me jumpy.

332
00:14:04,167 --> 00:14:06,711
[ASTA]
Those are Magna's glasses!

333
00:14:06,795 --> 00:14:07,629
--Oh, no!
--[NOELLE] It can't be!

334
00:14:07,712 --> 00:14:09,047
--Oh, no!
--They ate him?

335
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:10,048
[MAGNA groaning]

336
00:14:10,131 --> 00:14:12,050
[BOTH gasp]

337
00:14:20,016 --> 00:14:20,767
Luck.

338
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,519
Oh, man, are you guys okay?

339
00:14:22,602 --> 00:14:24,270
Talk to us!

340
00:14:27,482 --> 00:14:28,983
It's bad.

341
00:14:29,067 --> 00:14:31,236
The other Black Bulls were also
defeated by the magical beasts.

342
00:14:31,319 --> 00:14:32,445
[ASTA, NOELLE gasp]

343
00:14:32,529 --> 00:14:36,199
Asta, forget about us. Just run.

344
00:14:36,282 --> 00:14:39,744
Captain Yami. He's in trouble.

345
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:42,455
[knocking]

346
00:14:42,539 --> 00:14:44,332
It's occupied.

347
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:45,667
[banging]

348
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:48,753
Hey! I'm in here, dammit!

349
00:14:48,837 --> 00:14:50,255
Who is that?

350
00:14:50,338 --> 00:14:52,298
Look, if you good-for-nothin'
slackers are back already,

351
00:14:52,382 --> 00:14:53,758
then you better have
my pets with you.

352
00:14:53,842 --> 00:14:55,343
I'm up against a
tough opponent here,

353
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:57,679
and if I don't concentrate, he's
gonna go back into hiding, so--!

354
00:14:57,762 --> 00:14:58,930
[banging]

355
00:14:59,014 --> 00:15:01,558
Gimme a minute! Sheesh!

356
00:15:06,271 --> 00:15:07,772
I'm glad the three
of you are home,

357
00:15:07,856 --> 00:15:10,775
but you're probably not waitin'
in line to use the john, huh?

358
00:15:13,611 --> 00:15:15,655
[ASTA] Captain Yami's way
stronger than we are,

359
00:15:15,739 --> 00:15:17,449
so he might be okay.

360
00:15:17,532 --> 00:15:20,118
But Magna and Luck
almost got eaten alive!

361
00:15:20,201 --> 00:15:23,496
If all three attack him at once,
I'm not sure if he'll make it!

362
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:28,209
Just hang in there, okay?
I'm on my way to rescue you!

363
00:15:28,293 --> 00:15:31,129
[YAMI] Hey! Stop licking me
already, you big lugs!

364
00:15:31,212 --> 00:15:33,214
Ugh, your drool
smells like garbage!

365
00:15:33,298 --> 00:15:35,383
[ASTA groans]

366
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:36,885
What the heck, Captain Yami?

367
00:15:36,968 --> 00:15:38,553
I rushed over here to save you
'cause I thought you were

368
00:15:38,636 --> 00:15:41,639
being attacked by the magical
beasts, but you're fine!

369
00:15:41,723 --> 00:15:44,392
Well, I guess they
technically did attack me.

370
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:48,646
They... wanted... some
attention... from you.

371
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:50,565
C'mon, that's it? Really?

372
00:15:50,648 --> 00:15:53,151
These big fellas are
always crazy-affectionate.

373
00:15:53,234 --> 00:15:56,529
In fact, they've been like that
ever since I first met 'em.

374
00:15:56,613 --> 00:15:59,657
I remember I was on my
way back to the hideout.

375
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:05,413
[YAMI] When I found them,
the poor things' parents

376
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:09,167
had just been killed,
and they were all alone.

377
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,418
Guess some nobles were out

378
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:13,338
hunting magical
beasts for sport.

379
00:16:15,006 --> 00:16:16,508
[YAMI]
Sorry, little ones.

380
00:16:16,591 --> 00:16:18,718
Your folks aren't ever
gonna wake up again.

381
00:16:18,802 --> 00:16:20,970
Look. I got separated
from my parents, too,

382
00:16:21,054 --> 00:16:24,891
but all we can do is chin up
and keep on keepin' on.

383
00:16:24,974 --> 00:16:26,267
Hey, don't get the wrong idea,

384
00:16:26,351 --> 00:16:28,770
I never said I was
gonna take care of y--

385
00:16:30,897 --> 00:16:33,692
Now, how'm I supposed
to say no to that?

386
00:16:35,402 --> 00:16:37,362
Aw! Wow!

387
00:16:37,445 --> 00:16:39,823
That was such a
heartwarming story, sir!

388
00:16:39,906 --> 00:16:41,783
I bet those beasts
were so adorable

389
00:16:41,866 --> 00:16:44,244
when they were teeny-
weeny little babies!

390
00:16:44,327 --> 00:16:46,496
How... sweet.

391
00:16:46,579 --> 00:16:48,832
Anyway, it didn't even take
six months for these guys

392
00:16:48,915 --> 00:16:51,167
to grow up as big as
their parents had been.

393
00:16:51,251 --> 00:16:52,711
Costs me a fortune
to keep 'em fed,

394
00:16:52,794 --> 00:16:54,713
so I keep trying to abandon 'em.

395
00:16:54,796 --> 00:16:56,798
[ASTA]
Okay, you just ruined it!

396
00:16:56,881 --> 00:16:58,758
[HENRY]
That's... mean.

397
00:16:58,842 --> 00:17:00,552
I sent you guys off
to capture 'em so they

398
00:17:00,635 --> 00:17:02,762
didn't wander into a nearby
village and wreak havoc

399
00:17:02,846 --> 00:17:04,305
or anything like that.

400
00:17:04,389 --> 00:17:06,099
Although, if it seemed like they
wanted to return to the wild

401
00:17:06,182 --> 00:17:07,434
and be free,
I was kinda thinkin'

402
00:17:07,517 --> 00:17:09,144
of lettin' 'em loose in
the mountains somewhere

403
00:17:09,227 --> 00:17:11,021
as soon as we could get
a hold of 'em again.

404
00:17:11,104 --> 00:17:12,731
Whee!

405
00:17:12,814 --> 00:17:15,150
Hey, Captain Yami's
still in one piece!

406
00:17:15,233 --> 00:17:16,818
[ASTA]
Magna, you're back!

407
00:17:16,901 --> 00:17:18,820
I thought you were
hurt real bad!

408
00:17:18,903 --> 00:17:20,363
[MAGNA]
Nope!

409
00:17:20,447 --> 00:17:23,283
But they did lick us all over,
so we smell kinda ripe now.

410
00:17:23,366 --> 00:17:25,118
It seemed like they
were gonna gobble us up,

411
00:17:25,201 --> 00:17:27,912
but they just wanted us to
pet them and play with them!

412
00:17:27,996 --> 00:17:29,831
Apparently, it was enough
to make everyone

413
00:17:29,914 --> 00:17:31,291
faint from exhaustion.

414
00:17:31,374 --> 00:17:33,543
You're such a
troublesome group.

415
00:17:33,626 --> 00:17:35,712
Well, we figured if they
were that excited to see us,

416
00:17:35,795 --> 00:17:37,505
then Captain Yami would
have a really hard time

417
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:40,592
fighting them off, so we were
concerned for his safety!

418
00:17:40,675 --> 00:17:42,635
[MAGNA]
But, the boss-man's A-okay!

419
00:17:42,719 --> 00:17:43,970
[VANESSA]
I'm sure he's used to it.

420
00:17:44,054 --> 00:17:46,139
He <i>is</i> their owner, after all.

421
00:17:46,222 --> 00:17:47,015

422
00:17:47,098 --> 00:17:48,850
Who's a good magical beastie?

423
00:17:48,933 --> 00:17:51,478
I better make some dolls
of the three of you, as well.

424
00:17:51,561 --> 00:17:53,521
Don't lick Marie,
or you're dead.

425
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:54,522
[NOELLE]
They're pretty cute,

426
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:56,232
but their drool
smells like death.

427
00:17:56,316 --> 00:17:57,692
If you want us to
pet you some more,

428
00:17:57,776 --> 00:18:00,153
go take a bath and
brush your teeth.

429
00:18:00,236 --> 00:18:01,529
[ASTA]
I see.

430
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:03,156
They must love the rest
of the Black Bulls

431
00:18:03,239 --> 00:18:05,033
just like they love the captain!

432
00:18:05,116 --> 00:18:06,618
Hey there.

433
00:18:06,701 --> 00:18:09,454
Since I'm your caretaker, do you
want me to pet you for a while?

00:18:09,537 --> 00:18:11,247
[ASTA screams]

435
00:18:11,331 --> 00:18:12,415
[YAMI]
Judging by that look,

436
00:18:12,499 --> 00:18:14,751
they still think
of you as dinner.

437
00:18:14,834 --> 00:18:17,587
Nah, that can't be it,
these guys totally adore me!

438
00:18:17,671 --> 00:18:19,839
Here you go, I brought you
a little snacky-snack,

439
00:18:19,923 --> 00:18:21,841

I miss anything?

to this whole time?

that's your business, kid.

446
00:18:32,727 --> 00:18:34,813
The hideout's still
not finished?

Actually... it is.

put it... together.

470
00:19:31,953 --> 00:19:33,872
tomorrow's forecast, huh?

471
00:19:33,955 --> 00:19:36,207
[MARIE]
Mostly sunny, but partly cloudy.

472
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:37,917
Temperatures will be
mild during the day

473
00:19:38,001 --> 00:19:40,545
and a little chillier
as night falls.

474
00:19:41,921 --> 00:19:44,424
[GAUCHE] This talking
Marie doll is incredible!

475
00:19:44,507 --> 00:19:47,427
Henry is a genius!

476
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:49,804
No cute maid, huh? Oh, well.

477
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:53,475
I can... clean...
your room... for you.

478
00:19:53,558 --> 00:19:54,684
No thanks!

479
00:19:54,768 --> 00:19:57,062
Just... an idea.

480
00:19:57,145 --> 00:19:59,439
Uh, right. I appreciate
the thought.

481
00:19:59,522 --> 00:20:02,859
What about the rooms?
Who's everyone paired up with?

482
00:20:02,942 --> 00:20:05,862
I'm... glad... you asked.

483
00:20:05,945 --> 00:20:10,075
This part... was...
Gordon's request.

484
00:20:10,158 --> 00:20:12,327
[mumbling] We should all share
the same room as friends.

485
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:14,871
[NOELLE] What?! So I'm
not next door to Asta.

486
00:20:14,954 --> 00:20:17,415
I'm sharing a room
with him? As friends?

487
00:20:17,499 --> 00:20:19,376
That's a step above
"friends," isn't it?

488
00:20:19,459 --> 00:20:21,336
This is crazy!

489
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:23,046
[ASTA] Kinda reminds me
of sharing a space

490
00:20:23,129 --> 00:20:25,715
with Yuno and Nash
at the church.

491
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:28,343
Man, this is gonna be a blast!

492
00:20:28,426 --> 00:20:29,844
I'm not okay with this.

493
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:31,096
Neither am I.

494
00:20:31,179 --> 00:20:33,431
Right, this isn't up
to my royal standards.

495
00:20:33,515 --> 00:20:36,518
[whimpering] So shameful!

496
00:20:36,601 --> 00:20:39,521
Well, I can't say I'm crazy
about sharing a room with Luck,

497
00:20:39,604 --> 00:20:41,189
but it'll be fun
to stay up late,

498
00:20:41,272 --> 00:20:43,149
chattin' with Captain
Yami every night.

499
00:20:43,233 --> 00:20:45,026
Yeah, I'm gonna veto
that right now.

500
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:47,070
[gasps]

501
00:20:47,153 --> 00:20:49,781
Oh... right... I forgot.

502
00:20:49,864 --> 00:20:53,326
The captain's... in a...
different... room.

503
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:55,787
[BLACK BULLS]
Seriously?!

504
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:57,163
The hell is this?

505
00:20:57,247 --> 00:21:02,335
It... was a... request from...
the magic... beasts.

506
00:21:03,378 --> 00:21:06,965
[YAMI] Well, when you put
it like that, I guess...

507
00:21:07,048 --> 00:21:08,258
It's still a no!

508
00:21:08,341 --> 00:21:10,969
[ASTA yelps]

509
00:21:12,554 --> 00:21:13,722
[YAMI]
That's better.

510
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:16,516
We need a hideout, not a
freakin' amusement park.

511
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:18,727
That's why I made Henry change
it back into the dusty

512
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,770
old mansion it was
when we started.

513
00:21:20,854 --> 00:21:24,232
The wine fountain was nice,
but it's a lot cozier this way.

514
00:21:24,315 --> 00:21:27,068
[MAGNA] Yeah, it's got that
home-sweet-home feelin'.

515
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:29,279
[NOELLE] I'm definitely not
disappointed at all.

516
00:21:29,362 --> 00:21:30,780
No way.

517
00:21:32,615 --> 00:21:34,409
[ASTA] When I first
walked into this hideout

518
00:21:34,492 --> 00:21:37,454
after becoming a Black Bull,

519
00:21:37,537 --> 00:21:39,372
everyone accepted me
right off the bat,

520
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:42,167
even though I didn't
have any magic ability.

521
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:45,128
Ever since then, every day's
been an adventure.

522
00:21:45,211 --> 00:21:48,631
We had plenty of close calls,
but it always turned out okay,

523
00:21:48,715 --> 00:21:51,468
because they were
here to help me.

524
00:21:51,551 --> 00:21:52,344
You guys.

525
00:21:52,427 --> 00:21:54,012
There's something I need to say.

526
00:21:54,095 --> 00:21:57,057
I'm really glad I joined the
Black Bulls and met all of you!

527
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:00,852
Aw, what's making you get so
sentimental all of a sudden?

528
00:22:00,935 --> 00:22:02,354
[VANESSA]
I feel the same.

529
00:22:02,437 --> 00:22:04,064
[FINRAL]
All of us have grown so much

530
00:22:04,147 --> 00:22:06,274
because you never gave up, Asta.

531
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:07,692
[NOELLE]
You're reckless and stubborn,

532
00:22:07,776 --> 00:22:10,862
but that's not a bad
thing... sometimes.

533
00:22:10,945 --> 00:22:13,573
[FINRAL] We need to hurry
and clear Asta's name.

534
00:22:13,656 --> 00:22:14,407
[MAGNA, VANESSA, CHARMY]
Yeah.

535
00:22:14,491 --> 00:22:15,909
First things first.

536
00:22:15,992 --> 00:22:19,829
We better figure out everything
we can about those devils.

537
00:22:21,623 --> 00:22:22,957
[ASTA]
Right!

538
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:57,302
[ASTA] Now that we're
back at the hideout,

539
00:23:57,385 --> 00:23:59,721
I'm gonna push
myself even harder!

540
00:23:59,804 --> 00:24:00,805
Huh?

541
00:24:00,889 --> 00:24:03,016
Where are you off to,
Captain Yami?

542
00:24:03,099 --> 00:24:07,270
<i>Black Clover</i> , Page 126:
"The Blue Rose's Confession."

543
00:24:07,354 --> 00:24:09,814
I wonder what Captain
Charlotte is gonna confess?
