1
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:15,666
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,416
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:24,375
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:26,875
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,583
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:39,666
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:45,333
[ASTA] Check that out!
It's a floating castle!

8
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:46,583
This is it.

9
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:49,083
We're at the Eye of the
Midnight Sun's hideout.

10
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:53,291
[NARRATOR] The Royal Knights,
an elite team of fighters

11
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:55,500
chosen to defeat the
Eye of the Midnight Sun,

12
00:00:55,583 --> 00:00:58,166
were finally putting
their plan into action.

13
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:02,375
[ASTA] Yeah, that's Licht.
No doubt about it.

14
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:04,250
So we'll divide into
five teams of four

15
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:05,750
and make our move.

16
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:08,375
Team One will charge in
from the upper left!

17
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:09,583
[BOTH]
Yes, ma'am!

18
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:11,041
[MEREOLEONA]
Team Two, take the lower left!

19
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:12,291
[GROUP]
Yes, ma'am!

20
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:13,958
[MEREOLEONA] Team Three,
cover the upper right!

21
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:15,166
[ALL]
Yes, ma'am!

22
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,958
[MEREOLEONA]
Team Four, take the lower right!

23
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:17,958
[ALL]
Yes, ma'am!

24
00:01:18,041 --> 00:01:19,541
And we three members
of Team Five

25
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:21,125
will attack them head on.

26
00:01:21,208 --> 00:01:22,500
Ma'am!

27
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,833
All that matters is whether
you're strong or weak.

28
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:26,041
And the two of you are here

29
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:29,125
because you're strong,
isn't that correct?

30
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:31,625
[MEREOLEONA]
Two fools, chosen by Yami.

31
00:01:31,708 --> 00:01:34,375
I hope for your sakes
you do not disappoint me.

32
00:01:34,458 --> 00:01:35,708
Yes, ma'am!

33
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:38,500
Yeah, we'll do our best
to come back in one piece.

34
00:01:38,583 --> 00:01:40,333
Is that good enough for ya?

35
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:43,875
A team like you shouldn't need
a fully detailed battle plan.

36
00:01:43,958 --> 00:01:45,791
Eliminate any who dare
to get in your way

37
00:01:45,875 --> 00:01:48,208
as you head toward the center.

38
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:51,875
And of course, the
method is up to you!

39
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:53,958
[NARRATOR] Once they arrived
in the strong magic region

40
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:56,666
known as Gravito Stones,
the heroes invaded

41
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,083
the floating dungeon that
served as the enemy's hideout

42
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:00,583
and headed for the center.

43
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:02,833
Their ultimate goal
was to eliminate Licht,

44
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:06,166
the terrorist organization's
elusive leader.

45
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,208
Whoa! Crazy!

46
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:10,708
I feel like she doesn't
even need our help!

47
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:14,708
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
at the Black Bulls' hideout,

48
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:16,583
the mood was more relaxed.

49
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,291
[YAMI]
Ugh...

50
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:30,875
[SHEEP bleat]

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,041
[YAMI]
Well, I guess I'm headin' out.

52
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:35,791
What's going on, Captain?

53
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:37,625
I just got this
letter from Goldiguts

54
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:39,500
askin' to speak with me.

55
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:43,416
Sounds like he wants to
apologize for the Langris thing.

56
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,916
So, I'm off to their
HQ. Although...

57
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,875
I'm not sure why I'm the one
that has to go where he is.

58
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:51,458
Seems like the apologizer
should have to make the trip.

59
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:53,291
Does this mean I can
go and visit Marie

60
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:54,458
while you're away?

61
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,291
I can't believe you
just asked me that.

62
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:59,125
You stay put in case
a mission comes in.

63
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:00,041
Ugh.

64
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:01,166
I wanted to go
check on Finral,

65
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,625
so I'll be out for a bit, too.

66
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:06,083
How long can that
boy stay asleep?

67
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:08,541
Maybe if he senses I'm
there, he'll wake up.

68
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:11,750
[MAGNA] And I've got
some training to do!

69
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:14,875
I'm gonna get crazy strong,
you wait and see!

70
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:16,125
Good luck, Magna!

71
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:17,833
I know you didn't get
into the Royal Knights,

72
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:19,500
but try not to let
it get you down,

73
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:20,708
you little troublemaker!

74
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:22,291
I know there's an insult
in there somewhere.

75
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:23,750
I just can't tell where!

76
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:25,916
[CHARMY] I'm going out to
hunt for delicious goodies!

77
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,041
I'll dig up a
smorgasbord! See ya!

78
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,666
Um. Come back soon,
okay, you guys?

79
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,000
[mumbling]
I get so lonely without

80
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:36,291
all of your smiling faces here.

81
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,166
All right, I'll be
back in a while.

82
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,625
Do me a favor and
don't let the place

83
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:42,083
get overrun by robbers
while I'm gone.

84
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:49,875
Oh, boy. This is
gonna be a drag.

85
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:51,791
Well, when you see
that old quack,

86
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:54,291
ask him how Finral's holdin' up.

87
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:58,166
You got it, Captain Yami!

88
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,916
Here goes! Trainin' time!

89
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:06,833
[CHARMY] Hope you're ready,
my scrumptious little sweets!

90
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:10,375
The moment I've been growing
you for is finally here!

91
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,708
Charmy and the Sheep Cooks
are on the way to harvest

92
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:15,375
every last one of
you for snacking!

93
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:55,708
[mumbling] What a nice
intimate gathering

94
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:57,708
with two of my best friends.

95
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,500
[GAUCHE]
What's with this?

96
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:01,875
Grey and Gordon are both
sitting here staring me

97
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,375
right in the face,
but they're not saying

98
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,375
or doing anything at all!

99
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:08,416
Maybe it's because all the
usual loudmouths are gone,

100
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,583
but the silence
is kinda deafening!

101
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:12,375
[whimpering]

102
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:14,416
[mumbling] It'll be great for
the three of us to spend some

103
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,458
quality time together.

104
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,500
A lively conversation
such as this

105
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:17,958
can really lift the spirits!

106
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:18,625
[GAUCHE]
Hey!

107
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm sorry!

108
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:21,583
[mumbling] I know,
let's take turns

109
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:24,541
revealing our darkest secrets.
Though, I already know yours.

110
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:26,083
If a mission request
comes our way,

111
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:27,708
I'll handle it myself.

112
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:30,166
You two feel free to go to
your rooms and get some rest.

113
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,208
[yelps] Oh, no, please don't
trouble yourself on my account.

114
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:34,916
I would rather die!

115
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,791
[mumbling] Obviously, if a
mission request did come in,

116
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:38,291
I would be more than
happy to accompany you

117
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,083
as your best friend.

118
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,708
[GAUCHE] I can't understand
a word they're saying!

119
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:44,708
Just take some time to relax.

120
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:46,916
Besides, I need all the work
I can get so I'll have

121
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,583
extra money to pay tribute
to my darling sister!

122
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,916
[whimpering]

123
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,833
[mumbling] If that's what
you prefer. Then fine.

124
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,958
[GREY] I'm too shy to go
without Transformation Magic

125
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:01,750
and let people see
my true self anyway!

126
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,041
[mumbling] I was looking
forward to a chance

127
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,416
to deepen friendships
with everyone

128
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,791
at the Underwater Temple.

129
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,625
[GREY] Then again,
all the other Black Bulls

130
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:09,166
do think of me as a friend.

131
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,958
And if that's the case,
then I should at least

132
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:13,375
be myself in front
of them, right?

133
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:14,875
[mumbling] I was hoping
to strengthen our bonds

134
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:16,500
during the Star
Festival as well.

135
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:17,708
[GREY]
Besides.

136
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:19,666
Gauche even complimented
this version of me!

137
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,250
[mumbling] I'll use this time
to the fullest and build

138
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:26,000
a deeper relationship with them,
deeper than the deepest sea!

139
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:27,708
[GAUCHE]
All right, that's enough.

140
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:29,541
I'm going to my room
so I can concentrate

141
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,750
on making a doll
of my sweet goddess.

142
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,333
Let me know if anything happens.

143
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:36,041
--[GREY whimpers]
--[mumbling] But wait...

144
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:37,750
It's bad enough to be
in a group of three,

145
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,666
but if you leave us alone,
it'll be a one-on-one,

146
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,958
and everyone knows
that's the most

147
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:42,458
uncomfortable thing of all!

148
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:43,833
I mean, Gordon's
pretty quiet, too,

149
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:45,750
but it doesn't even
really matter who it is.

150
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,333
If I have to be alone
with another person,

151
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:51,125
I'm gonna melt into a
puddle of humiliation!

152
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:53,625
[GAUCHE] What is the
matter with these two?

153
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:55,125
[GREY]
Muster up your courage!

154
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,500
Try to make some
casual conversation!

155
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:59,916
Hey, G-Gauche, that's
an interesting project

156
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,375
you're working on there.
What exactly is it?

157
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:04,791
Oh, this?

158
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:06,125
Uh, yeah!

159
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:08,041
I'm glad you asked.
You see, when I was a nerd,

160
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:10,708
my eyes were opened to
the wonder of figurines.

161
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:14,000
So I'm making one depicting
Marie in one-eighth scale!

162
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:16,083
[GREY]
Wow. That's, uh...

163
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,916
[GAUCHE] I'll let you worship
her once I finish it.

164
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,500
Um. Should I be grateful? Sorry.

165
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:24,208
[mumbling] As I suspected,
my dear friend Gauche

166
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:25,916
does have an interest in dolls.

167
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,541
It appears the time
has finally come

168
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,375
to show you my own collection.

169
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:32,666
Oh no, please don't.
I'd rather not see that!

170
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,916
Peek.

171
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:38,583
[screams]

172
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:40,000
[GORDON mumbling]
These are my homemade

173
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:43,125
Black Bulls replica dolls.
Dead ringers, aren't they?

174
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:44,416
[GREY] Does this mean
his cloak's been full

175
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,625
of voodoo dolls
this entire time?

176
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:47,750
[mumbling] Aw,
so cute, so cute...

177
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:50,916
[GREY]
Ew, I don't like this at all!

178
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,833
Do you have any clue
how scary you are?

179
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:55,833
I know I've got no room to talk,

180
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:58,083
but if building friendships
is that important to you,

181
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:00,416
that means you have
to be more approachable!

182
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,041
And you can start
with your face!

183
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,000
[mumbling] What? My face?

184
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:05,666
[GAUCHE]
Try smiling for once.

185
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,416
[mumbling] If you say so.

186
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,500
[GAUCHE]
Go on.

187
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:10,791
[GREY]
Uh-oh.

188
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:13,500
--[GAUCHE] That's even worse!
--[GREY screams]

189
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:17,708
[mumbling] So painful.
You've broken my heart, Gauche.

190
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,000
There's no need
to be that harsh.

191
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:21,500
Well, anyway. Nature's calling.

192
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:23,708
[GAUCHE]
Don't touch her.

193
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,208
[GREY]
I got it!

194
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:28,666
Oh, wait. Where is it?

195
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,291
[mumbling] It's on the
second floor today,

196
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:31,916
down the hall to the right.

197
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,458
Gotcha.

198
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:34,916
I still don't understand why
this building has to change

199
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,958
its layout all the time--
it's really annoying

200
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:38,166
to keep track of.

201
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,500
[GORDON mumbles] Not sure.

202
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,333
It's been that way as long
as I've been here, so.

203
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:43,125
[GAUCHE]
Ugh, what a headache.

204
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,416
I'm sure it's some
kind of spell,

205
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,333
but what's the point
of having it?

206
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:48,708
Please come back as quickly
as you can, okay, Gauche?

207
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:49,791
Like I said before,

208
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:51,375
I'm extremely
uncomfortable with this!

209
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:54,958
What were Charmy and Vanessa
gossiping about earlier?

210
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:56,708
I saw something creepy!

211
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:59,208
It was hard to make out,
but it was definitely fluffy!

212
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:00,583
And it wasn't a
Sheep Cook either,

213
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:04,041
it was way more spooky
and mysterious than that!

214
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,916
I swear, it's not
the alcohol talking.

215
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,416
I'm telling the truth.
I saw a ghost.

216
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,791
A real-life ghost!
Hic! I'm serious.

217
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,000
[GAUCHE]
What if it's not a spell

218
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:17,833
and our hideout
really is haunted?

219
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:18,958
Come on.

220
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:20,166
You know it's not
funny to joke around

221
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,625
about things like that--

222
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,041
[screams]

223
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:35,458
[GREY screams]
Monsters!

224
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:38,291
[GAUCHE]
What the--? We're surrounded!

225
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:45,750
Oh, no, this is terrible.

226
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:48,333
Please try not to look at me,
it's too humiliating!

227
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:50,583
We have bigger problems here!

228
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:52,666
Hurry and transform already!

229
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,291
[mumbling] I can't believe so
many of you gathered together

230
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:55,833
so we could become friends.

231
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:57,541
No, you idiot!

232
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:59,375
I don't know what's
going on, but these people

233
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,666
are the opposite of our friends!

234
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,291
Get ready for battle!

235
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:11,583
[GAUCHE] What do you
think you're doing?

236
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:16,041
[SALLY]
So this place is Asta's hideout.

237
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:19,166
But I guess Asta
isn't around today, huh?

238
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,416
That's too bad.

239
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,916
I was looking forward
to dissecting him alive.

240
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,083
Sally.

241
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:25,958
For the last time,
he isn't your plaything,

242
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:27,791
because he belongs to me.

243
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:30,833
I was excited to have some
fun with him today, too.

244
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:33,416
Sally. Rades. Look.

245
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,583
You'd do well to remember
our current objective.

246
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:40,541
Huh. I guess if this is the
Black Bulls' secret hideout,

247
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:44,083
I'll probably find plenty of
toys just begging to be mine.

248
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,458
I can't wait for it.

249
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:48,916
Yay, experiments!
I want to cut them open!

250
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,791
Rearrange their innards!
Watch them bleed out!

251
00:11:56,583 --> 00:12:00,291
[ZOMBIES groan]

252
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:01,833
Lookie!

253
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,125
[GAUCHE]
All right, intruders, listen up.

254
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:09,000
I don't know whose
stupid decision it was

255
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,666
to break in here like this.

256
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,541
[GREY growls]

257
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:12,541
[mumbles] Foolish.

258
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:14,541
But you will pay!

259
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,375
[RADES]
Ah, here they are.

260
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:27,250
Those rotten Magic Knights.

261
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:29,208
You guys again?

262
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:32,041
[mumbling] Does that mean
you know them, Gauche?

263
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:34,041
[GAUCHE]
Of course I know them.

264
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:37,416
They're all terrorists from
the Eye of the Midnight Sun.

265
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,541
[mumbles] Those villains!

266
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,041
[GREY growls]

267
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:41,291
[GAUCHE]
So, what do you want?

268
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:44,125
Did you come here to get
another beating from us?

269
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:46,250
I noticed you're controlling
a bunch of wraiths,

270
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,375
so I'm guessing you're
the one they call Rades.

271
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:51,333
[cackles] This guy gets it.

272
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:53,708
We're on the hunt for something.

273
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,208
Is that right?

274
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:57,625
In this rundown old
mess of a hideout?

275
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:59,541
[RADES] Ha! You may
not know about it,

276
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:02,708
but it's definitely here.
And it's something good, too.

277
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:04,958
[mumbling] Is it friendship?
'Cause we have lots of that.

278
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:06,375
Would you shut up?

279
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:07,708
You idiots!

280
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:10,041
Don't worry, we'll find it,
and we might as well

281
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,083
tear this place to pieces
while we're at it!

[GAUCHE]
Not if I kill you first.

284
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:18,416
Now, Mirror Magic: Reflect Ray!

Gel Magic! Go,
Sticky Salamander!

286

There it goes!

287
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:25,791
[GAUCHE]
I forgot.

288
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:28,500
My kind of magic is
useless against hers.

289
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:29,416
Tch!

290
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,125
There's no need to get upset!

291
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:33,041
Gauche is your name, isn't it?

292
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:34,583
You're not my target.

293
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:36,500
In fact, I was specifically
instructed to leave you alive,

294
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,500
so you've got nothing
to worry about!

295
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:41,666
Huh? What do you mean?

296
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,541
[SALLY]
To be honest, I'm not too sure.

297
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:46,125
You'd have to ask Master Licht.

298
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:48,666
[GAUCHE]
Their leader really said that?

299
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,375
Come to think of it...

300
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:55,583
I'm sorry. I should
never have hurt you.

301
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:57,500
Me? What're you talking about?

302
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:58,916
[YAMI] Oh, didn't know
you guys were friends

303
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,208
or I wouldn'ta beat him up.

304
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:02,458
Of course I'm not friends
with this monster.

305
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:05,666
One day you'll understand.

306
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,166
[GAUCHE]
Why did he say that?

307
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,916

about these guys!

piqued my interest!
