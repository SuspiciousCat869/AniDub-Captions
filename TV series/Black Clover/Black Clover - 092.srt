[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,059
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:31,896 --> 00:00:34,107
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:36,693
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:43,283 --> 00:00:45,243
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:45,326 --> 00:00:49,372
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7

[NARRATOR]
Aiming to defeat Licht,

8
00:00:52,667 --> 00:00:54,627
leader of the
Eye of the Midnight Sun,

9
00:00:54,711 --> 00:00:56,212
Asta and his fellow
Royal Knights

10
00:00:56,296 --> 00:00:58,131
stormed his floating fortress.

11
00:00:58,214 --> 00:01:00,800
Their attack seemed to
overwhelm the enemy at first.

12
00:01:00,884 --> 00:01:01,843
Until...

13
00:01:01,926 --> 00:01:04,304
Seriously, why are we here?

14
00:01:04,387 --> 00:01:06,681
Did I say you could
duplicate yourself?

15
00:01:06,765 --> 00:01:09,934
Hey! It's not like
I had any choice in this!

16
00:01:10,018 --> 00:01:12,103
Whatever! You're
obviously the fake one!

17
00:01:12,187 --> 00:01:13,897
You're the fake one
and you know it!

18
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,398
[MEREOLEONA]
Stop yelling.

That's one solution.

00:01:21,196 --> 00:01:24,449
What's wrong with you?!
You coulda killed me!

23
00:01:24,532 --> 00:01:26,493
You survived a trial by fire,

24
00:01:26,576 --> 00:01:29,913
and I wouldn't have
brought anyone who couldn't.

25
00:01:29,996 --> 00:01:31,331
[NARRATOR]
The imposter was none other than

26
00:01:31,414 --> 00:01:34,042
Rhya the Disloyal,
last remaining member

27
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:35,335
of the Third Eye.

28
00:01:39,005 --> 00:01:41,716
[MEREOLEONA] I'll show you
what destruction looks like!

29

Flame Magic: Calidos Brachium!

30
00:01:47,222 --> 00:01:49,099
[NARRATOR] Thus began a fierce
battle between the powers

31
00:01:49,182 --> 00:01:51,267
of Flame Magic and Copy Magic.

32
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:58,817
[NARRATOR] As the fight
raged on, the ferocity

33
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:02,445
of Mereoleona's attack spells
got the better of Rhya.

34
00:02:02,529 --> 00:02:06,825
Nearby, Yuno's team approached
the center of the fortress.

00:02:06,908 --> 00:02:08,660
[MIDNIGHT SUN MAGES yell]

36
00:02:08,743 --> 00:02:11,037
Sorry, but you can't defeat me.

37
00:02:11,121 --> 00:02:12,914

Do you hear that?

41
00:02:17,252 --> 00:02:19,838
[gasps]
I heard it before, too!

42
00:02:19,921 --> 00:02:21,339
[YUNO]
A heartbeat?

43
00:02:21,423 --> 00:02:24,342
The mana here feels so familiar.

44
00:02:27,721 --> 00:02:29,973
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
the Black Bulls celebrate

45
00:02:30,056 --> 00:02:32,142
a narrow victory after
a surprise attack

46
00:02:32,225 --> 00:02:33,727
by the Midnight Sun.

47
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:36,062
We... We managed
to fend them off somehow,

48
00:02:36,146 --> 00:02:37,272
but what are we supposed to do

49
00:02:37,355 --> 00:02:39,691
now that our hideout
is in ruins?

50
00:02:39,774 --> 00:02:42,235
We won't be inviting
those guests back again!

51
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:43,778
Um... Henry?

52
00:02:43,862 --> 00:02:46,364
Are you absolutely sure that
you can't fix the hideout?

53
00:02:46,448 --> 00:02:51,369
Not now. My magic's all spent.

54
00:02:51,453 --> 00:02:53,955
[GREY]
What are we going to do, Gauche?

55
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:56,583
[GAUCHE] I'm not doing anything
until I find my Marie treasures!

56
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:58,335
Now where did they go?!

57
00:02:58,418 --> 00:03:03,631
[HENRY] Crushed to bits,
I bet. In tiny little pieces.

58
00:03:03,715 --> 00:03:06,259
[GAUCHE] If you're gonna piss
me off, at least hurry it up!

59
00:03:06,343 --> 00:03:08,887
And while you're at it, get down
here and help me would you?

60
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,388
[HENRY]
You sure?

61
00:03:10,472 --> 00:03:11,806
[GAUCHE]
Get your big, slow-talking,

62
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:13,850
mop head off
that wall right now!

63
00:03:13,933 --> 00:03:16,186
[GREY]
Um, Gauche? Wait.

64
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:18,063
[GORDON] I wouldn't
recommend that, actually.

65
00:03:18,146 --> 00:03:19,356
[GAUCHE]
Hurry up!

66
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:21,524
You know...

67
00:03:21,608 --> 00:03:24,611
Whatever it is,
I don't care. Get down here!

68
00:03:24,694 --> 00:03:28,239
[HENRY]
Okie-dokie.

69
00:03:28,323 --> 00:03:29,366
[GREY whimpers]

70
00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:31,201
[GAUCHE]
Ugh. Was that so hard, y--

71
00:03:35,789 --> 00:03:37,707
Wh-When Henry
gets too close to someone,

72

he sucks all of
their power away!

73
00:03:40,794 --> 00:03:42,629
We tried to warn you, Gauche.

74
00:03:46,257 --> 00:03:51,513
I found it!
Thank goodness you're safe!

75
00:03:51,596 --> 00:03:54,766
And look! There's not a scratch
on you, not even a speck of--

76
00:03:54,849 --> 00:03:55,767
Huh?

77
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:58,520
You've been tainted!

78
00:03:58,603 --> 00:03:59,813
I'll kill them all!

79
00:03:59,896 --> 00:04:02,232
The Eye of the
Midnight Sun is dead!

80
00:04:02,315 --> 00:04:05,860
How are you gonna
do that? They're all gone.

81
00:04:05,944 --> 00:04:08,446
Shut up or
I'll kill you while I'm at it!

82
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:11,408
[GAUCHE growls]

83
00:04:11,491 --> 00:04:14,452
[HENRY]
I'll behave.

84
00:04:14,536 --> 00:04:16,287
Give me my magic back!

85
00:04:16,371 --> 00:04:18,289
[HENRY]
Nope. Can't.

86
00:04:18,373 --> 00:04:20,125
What the heck
is that s'posed to mean?!

87
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:22,627
I can't.

88
00:04:22,711 --> 00:04:24,295
I'm worried, though.

89
00:04:24,379 --> 00:04:26,172
The Eye of the Midnight Sun
said they came here

90
00:04:26,256 --> 00:04:28,133
looking for something, remember?

91
00:04:28,216 --> 00:04:31,594
But we still don't know what
that is or what it might do!

92
00:04:31,678 --> 00:04:33,930
[GAUCHE]
Probably just a bluff.

93
00:04:34,014 --> 00:04:35,390
The only thing here
that's worth anything

94
00:04:35,473 --> 00:04:37,559
is my Marie memorabilia.

95
00:04:37,642 --> 00:04:40,061
You don't think they
were coming for my dolls?

96
00:04:40,145 --> 00:04:42,147
I don't think so, guys.

97
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:44,065
Well, if there was
something valuable here,

98
00:04:44,149 --> 00:04:45,608
then it must be...

99
00:04:47,861 --> 00:04:48,820
What do you mean?

100
00:04:48,903 --> 00:04:50,196
Is it me?

101
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,906
Ugh. Forget it, all right?

102
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:54,325
Whatever this is about,
Captain Yami can figure it out

103
00:04:54,409 --> 00:04:56,578
once he finally
decides to come back.

104
00:04:56,661 --> 00:04:58,371
[GREY]
I hope so!

105
00:04:58,455 --> 00:05:00,373
Such unlucky timing, too.

106
00:05:00,457 --> 00:05:03,168
"Don't let the place get
overrun by robbers," he said.

107
00:05:03,251 --> 00:05:04,461
Is he psychic?

108
00:06:38,555 --> 00:06:39,931
[YAMI sighs]

Captain of the Black Bulls?

there forever, though.

like some more tea, perhaps?

More tea.

Are you trying to drown me
in this stuff, or what?

Do you know how many times

00:07:15,717 --> 00:07:17,218
I've had to go to
the bathroom today?

It's gonna start pouring
outta my ears any minute now!

And by the way, is this
some kinda herbal bullcrap,

129
00:07:21,931 --> 00:07:24,267
'cause it tastes like I got
a pine tree in my mouth!

called me here to apologize.

What's the big idea making
me wait around all day?

How much longer
is this gonna take?

Not at all, sir!

You know.

My ride's outta commission
at the moment,

142
00:07:49,084 --> 00:07:50,502
so it wasn't exactly convenient

00:07:50,585 --> 00:07:52,462
to drag my butt
all the way out here.

I know selection exam battles
can get pretty intense,

00:07:58,551 --> 00:08:01,012
but that Vice Captain
of yours was off the rails.

147

He busted up Finral
like nobody's business.

In fact, he's still
in the hospital now.

in for questioning,
but that's going nowhere fast.

[YAMI] If he had any
manners, it seems to me

your captain would've
come to my place,

154

rather than keeping me
waiting all day.

00:08:28,498 --> 00:08:31,501
enough for the way that
Vice-Captain Langris behaved.

159
00:08:31,584 --> 00:08:32,919
That aside.

160
00:08:33,003 --> 00:08:35,714
I assure you that Captain
Vangeance is trustworthy.

161
00:08:35,797 --> 00:08:38,258
He's a man of tremendous
integrity as well.

162
00:08:38,341 --> 00:08:40,176
Whatever his reason
for making you wait,

163
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,221
I know he would never be
intentionally discourteous.

164
00:08:43,304 --> 00:08:45,849
[YAMI sighs]

165
00:08:45,932 --> 00:08:47,475
Okay, who the hell are you?

166
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:48,768
[WILLIAM]
I'm not an enemy.

167
00:08:48,852 --> 00:08:50,270
You say you're not,
but you look pretty shady

168
00:08:50,353 --> 00:08:52,480
in that peacock
costume of yours!

169
00:08:52,564 --> 00:08:54,566
[WILLIAM]
Yami, I believe your name was?

170
00:08:54,649 --> 00:08:56,985
Watch my back, if you would.

171
00:08:57,068 --> 00:08:58,403
[YAMI]
This guy.

172
00:08:58,486 --> 00:09:01,573
He moves like he's able
to read my mind or somethin'!

173
00:09:01,656 --> 00:09:04,159
Our ki must be
on the same wavelength!

174
00:09:05,493 --> 00:09:08,079
[YAMI] How many years
has it been since then?

175
00:09:08,163 --> 00:09:12,000
We both became squad
captains together.

176
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:13,585
Well, I'm the kinda guy

177
00:09:13,668 --> 00:09:16,546
who goes with his gut instinct.

178
00:09:16,629 --> 00:09:19,966
Vangeance. If you don't mind.

179
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:21,843
Lose the mask.

180
00:09:21,926 --> 00:09:23,345
[WILLIAM]
I understand, Yami.

181
00:09:23,428 --> 00:09:25,430
You're suspicious
of me, aren't you?

182
00:09:25,513 --> 00:09:28,933
You think I might be the leader
of the Eye of the Midnight Sun.

183
00:09:29,017 --> 00:09:32,395
[YAMI] There's something about
him that I feel in you, too.

184
00:09:32,479 --> 00:09:35,231
So c'mon. Show me your face.

185
00:09:37,317 --> 00:09:38,651
[YAMI grunts]

186
00:09:41,488 --> 00:09:45,784
[WILLIAM] My whole life,
they called me a cursed child.

187
00:09:45,867 --> 00:09:48,953
I'm glad I got the chance
to show you who I am.

188
00:09:49,037 --> 00:09:50,872
Thank you, Yami.

189
00:09:50,955 --> 00:09:54,334
[YAMI] I didn't have any reason
to doubt his sincerity.

190
00:09:54,417 --> 00:09:57,003
Please, sir, just a bit longer.

191
00:09:57,087 --> 00:09:59,172
Have faith in the captain.

192
00:09:59,255 --> 00:10:04,552
Huh. Yeah, I know.
You don't gotta tell me twice.

193
00:10:06,096 --> 00:10:10,433
Julius, sir! Are you here, sir?
I need to speak with you.

194
00:10:10,517 --> 00:10:12,227
I take my eyes off him
for one second

195
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:15,772
and he runs off. Show some
responsibility for once!

196
00:10:15,855 --> 00:10:17,982
You're the Wizard King!

197
00:10:18,066 --> 00:10:20,985
I'd love to complain
about this pile of work he left,

198
00:10:21,069 --> 00:10:23,697
but my Transmission Magic
isn't getting through.

199
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:37,335
[JULIUS]
Right now, I'm sure

200
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:39,379
the Royal Knights are
fighting their final battle

201
00:10:39,462 --> 00:10:41,214
with the Eye of
the Midnight Sun,

202
00:10:41,297 --> 00:10:43,383
deep within their hideout.

203
00:10:43,466 --> 00:10:45,719
Of course, I'd love
to swoop in and join them,

204
00:10:45,802 --> 00:10:47,137
but I've been watching
them long enough

205
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,806
to know that they'll
be fine on their own.

206
00:10:49,889 --> 00:10:51,683
Their power and
their desire to keep

207
00:10:51,766 --> 00:10:55,186
this nation safe
will not fail them.

208
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:58,732
I need only offer
them my faith, even from afar.

209
00:10:58,815 --> 00:11:01,443
Besides, Marx would
be furious if I left.

210
00:11:02,736 --> 00:11:05,572
[JULIUS] I have my own duty
to attend to, after all.

211
00:11:05,655 --> 00:11:07,198
Here and now.

212
00:11:09,117 --> 00:11:13,163
How unusual for you to come
to speak with me like this.

213
00:11:13,246 --> 00:11:14,914
What is the occasion, William?

214
00:11:18,918 --> 00:11:20,670
First, I must thank you
for taking the time

215
00:11:20,754 --> 00:11:23,298
to indulge my selfish request.

216
00:11:26,217 --> 00:11:28,178
From the start,
you have acknowledged me

217
00:11:28,261 --> 00:11:32,682
for my worth, even though
my appearance is strange.

218
00:11:32,766 --> 00:11:36,311
When I met you, my entire future
opened up before me.

219
00:11:38,271 --> 00:11:39,856
[WILLIAM]
I was raised as a cursed child

220
00:11:39,939 --> 00:11:43,276
in a poor village
in the Forsaken Realm.

221
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,987
I suffered such cruel treatment,
even from the family

222
00:11:46,071 --> 00:11:48,823
where I had been welcomed
as a nobleman's successor.

223
00:11:48,907 --> 00:11:50,200
--But then...
--[JULIUS] Incredible!

224
00:11:50,283 --> 00:11:52,619
What was that magic you
were just using?

225
00:11:52,702 --> 00:11:54,788
[WILLIAM]
You showed me kindness.

226
00:11:54,871 --> 00:11:56,706
You showed me respect.

227
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:59,918
You invited me to
become a Magic Knight.

228
00:12:00,001 --> 00:12:01,378
[JULIUS]
I'm serious.

229
00:12:01,461 --> 00:12:03,505
Your face isn't something
you ought to be ashamed of.

230
00:12:03,588 --> 00:12:06,007
However, if it bothers
you that much...

231
00:12:06,091 --> 00:12:07,801
...I'll give you this mask!

232
00:12:10,261 --> 00:12:12,597
[WILLIAM] When you presented
me with this gift...

233
00:12:12,681 --> 00:12:15,141
When you allowed me
to join your order...

234
00:12:15,225 --> 00:12:17,310
Then everything
became certain to me.

235
00:12:17,394 --> 00:12:20,397
I would dedicate my grimoire
to you and your cause.

236
00:12:23,566 --> 00:12:26,111
[WILLIAM] It's been
11 years, and my sentiments

237
00:12:26,194 --> 00:12:27,779
haven't changed one bit.

238
00:12:28,822 --> 00:12:32,826
There's no one in this world
that I respect as much as you.

239
00:12:32,909 --> 00:12:35,912
Uh, yeah! Where did
all this praise come from?

240
00:12:35,995 --> 00:12:37,372
How 'bout that tournament, huh?

241
00:12:37,455 --> 00:12:38,957
[laughs]

242
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,793
[WILLIAM]
Bit by bit, I climbed the ranks,

243
00:12:41,876 --> 00:12:44,629
until I became
a Magic Knight captain.

244
00:12:44,713 --> 00:12:46,297
Guided by my own mana,

245
00:12:46,381 --> 00:12:48,174
I selected talented
squad members

246
00:12:48,258 --> 00:12:51,344
and created the Golden Dawn.

247
00:12:51,428 --> 00:12:54,222
As thanks for
the kindness you showed me,

248
00:12:54,305 --> 00:12:55,890
I built the strongest
squad of knights

249
00:12:55,974 --> 00:12:57,851
that I could assemble.

250
00:12:57,934 --> 00:13:00,437
I did that for you.

251
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:04,607
But also, for someone else
who is equally dear to me.

252
00:13:07,193 --> 00:13:09,696
A friend who's always
been at my side.

253
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:12,198
One I've known
even longer than you.

254
00:13:12,282 --> 00:13:14,367
Now, I'm faced
with two loved ones,

255
00:13:14,451 --> 00:13:17,787
who desire two very
different paths.

256
00:13:17,871 --> 00:13:20,248
I'm torn between the dream
that we've fought for

257
00:13:20,331 --> 00:13:23,877
and the dream of my dear friend.
I've known from the start,

258
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,297
I couldn't possibly
choose between you.

259
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,923
So, now...

260
00:13:29,007 --> 00:13:32,010
That decision must
fall on your shoulders.

261
00:13:32,093 --> 00:13:33,678
[JULIUS]
His scars!

262
00:13:39,267 --> 00:13:41,102
[LICHT]
William, my only human friend,

263
00:13:41,186 --> 00:13:44,272
I know this was hard
for you. I'm grateful.

264
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:49,194
Greetings to you, Wizard
King Julius Novachrono.

265
00:13:49,277 --> 00:13:52,614
I am the leader of the
Eye of the Midnight Sun,

266
00:13:52,697 --> 00:13:54,824
known as Licht.

267
00:13:54,908 --> 00:13:58,578
I have dreaded
this day. Yet here we are.

268
00:14:08,838 --> 00:14:11,508
[JULIUS] William. I knew
you'd been hiding something

269
00:14:11,591 --> 00:14:13,677
for a long time now.
A part of you

270
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,471
that you couldn't show
to anyone. Not even me.

271
00:14:17,681 --> 00:14:19,933
[JULIUS] Yami felt
the same way, I'm certain.

272
00:14:21,184 --> 00:14:23,061
Perhaps Fuegoleon
saw your true form

273
00:14:23,144 --> 00:14:25,522
before his defeat.
That must have come

274
00:14:25,605 --> 00:14:28,483
as quite a shock for him.

275
00:14:28,566 --> 00:14:30,235
The day the royal
capital was attacked

276
00:14:30,318 --> 00:14:32,362
by the Eye of the Midnight Sun.

277
00:14:32,445 --> 00:14:36,241
The profound unease I felt
when I was confronted by Licht.

278
00:14:36,324 --> 00:14:39,160
I was struck by
the familiar air of his mana.

279
00:14:39,244 --> 00:14:40,662
And I couldn't help but notice

280
00:14:40,745 --> 00:14:43,540
that you made yourself scarce
after I injured his hand.

281
00:14:43,623 --> 00:14:46,292
Naturally, my suspicions
began to grow.

282
00:14:46,376 --> 00:14:49,421
Yet, I told myself
it couldn't possibly be true.

283
00:14:49,504 --> 00:14:53,258
I trusted you, after all. But
now I've witnessed the truth.

284
00:14:53,341 --> 00:14:55,343
You and William
are not the same, but rather,

285
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:58,346
two souls in one body.

286
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,558
In that sense,
I suppose I wasn't betrayed.

287
00:15:03,643 --> 00:15:05,937
[JULIUS] How did you get rid
of the scars on your face?

288
00:15:06,021 --> 00:15:08,273
It didn't seem to be magic.

289
00:15:08,356 --> 00:15:10,442
The scars belong
only to William.

290
00:15:10,525 --> 00:15:12,027
The mark of a curse he inherited

291
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:14,571
from his mother's
side of the family.

292
00:15:14,654 --> 00:15:16,156
But even if I share this body,

293
00:15:16,239 --> 00:15:19,325
a human's curse has
nothing to do with me.

294
00:15:19,409 --> 00:15:22,662
In fact, I despise humans.

295
00:15:22,746 --> 00:15:26,583
William, of course,
is the sole exception.

296
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:30,587
We were able to coexist
in the same body, after all.

297
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:33,840
He may have been human,
but he accepted my feelings.

298
00:15:33,923 --> 00:15:36,593
He understood me.

299
00:15:36,676 --> 00:15:42,891
My boundless fury,
sorrow, hatred, all of it.

300
00:15:42,974 --> 00:15:44,476
[LICHT]
We're like this bird.

301
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:47,979
It's not strong, but it can do
something special--it can fly.

302
00:15:48,063 --> 00:15:50,899
As for us,
we have special magic powers

303
00:15:50,982 --> 00:15:53,860
that the humans envy,
so they want to cause us pain.

304
00:15:53,943 --> 00:15:56,404
Still, I think we may be able

305
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:59,074
to understand each
other better someday.

306
00:15:59,157 --> 00:16:00,909
[LICHT]
How wrong I was.

307
00:16:02,869 --> 00:16:04,496
[LICHT]
I admit, I was a bit surprised.

308
00:16:04,579 --> 00:16:07,207
I didn't think your brother
would feel the same way as me.

309
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:09,334
We both feel strongly about it.

310
00:16:09,417 --> 00:16:11,169
I know it won't
happen overnight,

311
00:16:11,252 --> 00:16:14,047

can live in harmony.

If not, what will we do?

313
00:16:16,174 --> 00:16:21,179
Don't worry. We're proof
that it can happen, right?

00:16:21,262 --> 00:16:23,473
Yeah.

never met those humans.

There's only one way

319
00:16:32,065 --> 00:16:34,150
to bring them the
justice they deserve.

320
00:16:34,234 --> 00:16:37,028
To quench this blazing hatred.

321
00:16:37,112 --> 00:16:39,155
I will gather
all the magic stones

322
00:16:39,239 --> 00:16:41,616
and fulfill our
ambitions at last.

[JULIUS]
Hmm...

324
00:16:43,243 --> 00:16:46,538
So it's revenge he wants.
Against all humanity.

325
00:16:46,621 --> 00:16:49,124
But how will he use the
stones to accomplish that?

326
00:16:49,207 --> 00:16:51,584
William understood my suffering.

327
00:16:51,668 --> 00:16:54,796
That's why he set up this
little meeting between us.

328
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,007
[LICHT]
I believe the remaining stones

329
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:58,675
are in your possession?

330
00:17:00,301 --> 00:17:03,930
We thought that would be the
safest course of action.

331
00:17:04,014 --> 00:17:05,640
[LICHT]
I will attain those stones now

332
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:07,809
and bring our hopes to fruition.

333
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:14,858
I understand. You've always
had such a kind heart.

334
00:17:14,941 --> 00:17:17,068
Your dear friend is in
pain and you'd do anything

335
00:17:17,152 --> 00:17:20,447
to ease his suffering,
wouldn't you, William?

336
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:22,657
But you must
be suffering as well.

337
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:26,619
And just as your friend relied
on you, you can rely on me.

338
00:17:26,703 --> 00:17:28,621
I am always on your side.

00:17:30,331 --> 00:17:33,376
That's why I will bring
an end to this no matter what.

[LICHT]
You may believe what you like,

but his heart and mine
are one on this matter.

342
00:17:39,215 --> 00:17:43,178
Now, Wizard King. I think
it's time for you to die.

00:17:43,261 --> 00:17:45,638
As the most powerful
mage in this nation,

344

you must bear its sins.

The crimes that were
committed by its people

346

will be paid for in your blood.

it's going to flow,
