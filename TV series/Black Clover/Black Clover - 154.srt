[NARRATOR]
The Clover Kingdom.

2
00:00:24,514 --> 00:00:26,933
In this place where
magic is everything,

3
00:00:27,017 --> 00:00:30,228
there lives one boy
who was born without it.

4
00:00:30,311 --> 00:00:33,231
His name is Asta.

5
00:00:33,314 --> 00:00:34,733
His strength and determination

6
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:36,776
helped him become
a Magic Knight.

7
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,362
And despite the many
challenges he faces,

8
00:00:39,446 --> 00:00:43,283
he aims for the top
and refuses to give up!

9
00:00:43,366 --> 00:00:44,951
Rich or poor,

10
00:00:45,035 --> 00:00:46,911
royalty or commoner,

11
00:00:46,995 --> 00:00:49,748
Asta believes anyone can shine.

12
00:00:49,831 --> 00:00:52,709
His mission is to prove
that to the whole world,

13
00:00:52,792 --> 00:00:55,628
and to become the
next Wizard King!

14
00:00:59,591 --> 00:01:01,468
[NARRATOR] The captains
held a meeting to decide

15
00:01:01,551 --> 00:01:05,055
who would go to train
in the Heart Kingdom.

16
00:01:05,138 --> 00:01:06,890
Five of the Black Bulls:

17
00:01:06,973 --> 00:01:12,479
Asta, Nero, Luck,
Finral, and Noelle.

18
00:01:12,562 --> 00:01:14,647
Mimosa from the Golden Dawn.

19
00:01:14,731 --> 00:01:17,192
Leopold of the
Crimson Lion Kings.

20
00:01:17,275 --> 00:01:19,944
Captain Charlotte chose
to nominate herself.

21
00:01:20,028 --> 00:01:23,573
As did Captain Rill
from the Aqua Deer.

22
00:01:23,656 --> 00:01:25,367
This elite group
would be learning

23
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:28,787
from the five Spirit Guardians.

24
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:31,748
Afterward, during the
decoration ceremony,

25
00:01:31,831 --> 00:01:33,667
those who had performed
especially well

26
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,503
in the last conflict
were recognized.

27
00:01:36,586 --> 00:01:37,629
Leopold,

28
00:01:37,712 --> 00:01:41,383
Sol, and Mimosa
received promotions.

29
00:01:41,466 --> 00:01:42,592
Then...

30
00:01:42,676 --> 00:01:44,844
[MARX] You're being
promoted as well, Yuno.

31
00:01:44,928 --> 00:01:48,306
To first-class
Senior Magic Knight.

32
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:49,974
[GROUP gasps]

33
00:01:50,058 --> 00:01:54,437
[NARRATOR] Yuno was promoted to
the highest rank below Captain.

34
00:01:54,521 --> 00:01:57,816
The king, not to be outdone,
made his own promotion.

35
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:01,319
[KING CLOVER] By my authority
as the ruler of this kingdom,

36
00:02:01,403 --> 00:02:02,904
I award to Sekke the title

37
00:02:02,987 --> 00:02:05,240
of first-class
Senior Magic Knight!

38
00:02:05,323 --> 00:02:06,866
[GROUP gasps]

39
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:10,412
[SEKKE] Did he say "first-class
Senior Magic Knight"?

40
00:02:10,495 --> 00:02:12,622
That's like the cream
of the crah- <i>ha</i> p!

41
00:02:12,706 --> 00:02:13,957
[NARRATOR]
Surprisingly,

42
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,627
Sekke was given the same
prestigious title as Yuno.

43
00:02:17,711 --> 00:02:20,547
Back at the Black Bulls hideout,
there was one squad member

44
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,632
who refused to
accept his exclusion

45
00:02:22,716 --> 00:02:24,426
from training in
the Heart Kingdom.

46
00:02:24,509 --> 00:02:25,802
[MAGNA]
Please, Boss!

47
00:02:25,885 --> 00:02:27,679
I'm begging you here!

48
00:02:27,762 --> 00:02:29,556
If I'm going to be a real man,

49
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:32,225
then I refuse to be
left behind anymore!

50
00:02:32,308 --> 00:02:35,645
I'll go, even if you
tell me to stay here!

51
00:02:35,729 --> 00:02:37,355
You good with that?

52
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:38,857
[MAGNA]
Yes, sir!

53
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,651
I can push past
the limits of my mana!

54
00:02:41,735 --> 00:02:44,154
More than any
commoner has before!

55
00:02:44,237 --> 00:02:49,993
All right. I'll ask Julius
if there's room for another guy.

56
00:02:50,076 --> 00:02:52,996
[NARRATOR] And, at the
Golden Dawn's headquarters,

57
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:55,874
not everyone was pleased
to hear about the promotion

58
00:02:55,957 --> 00:02:58,585
that the Wizard King
had awarded to Yuno.

59
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:05,592
[DAVID] A first-class Senior
Magic Knight, huh?

60
00:03:05,675 --> 00:03:08,636
Now he's the same rank
as Vice Captain Langris.

61
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,639
Which is crazy, since he's
only been with us for a year.

62
00:03:11,723 --> 00:03:15,393
I'm not exactly surprised.
Yuno's really powerful.

63
00:03:15,477 --> 00:03:17,604
Come to think of it,
Langris hasn't been on a mission

64
00:03:17,687 --> 00:03:20,065
since everything that happened
with the Midnight Sun.

65
00:03:20,148 --> 00:03:21,900
If you ask me,
it's only a matter of time

66
00:03:21,983 --> 00:03:23,485
before Yuno takes his job.

67
00:03:23,568 --> 00:03:24,986
Ever since he got
that promotion,

68
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:27,405
it's all anyone talks
about around here.

69
00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:28,698
For good reason!

70
00:03:28,782 --> 00:03:31,076
Yuno and Langris are both
amazing mages and all,

71
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:33,161
but when it comes to
who would be a better VC,

72
00:03:33,244 --> 00:03:36,414
I gotta tell you,
the answer is pretty obvious.

73
00:03:36,498 --> 00:03:38,208
[gasps]

74
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:40,752
Oh, Vice Captain Langris, sir!

75
00:03:40,835 --> 00:03:45,131
Hello there. Out for a stroll?
It's a wonderful day for it!

76
00:03:45,215 --> 00:03:47,634
Please enjoy. I should go.

77
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,682
[DAVID] It's only a matter of
time before Yuno takes his job.

78
00:05:31,321 --> 00:05:33,281
[WILLIAM]
Don't you think it's about time?

79
00:05:33,365 --> 00:05:34,699
Time for what, sir?

80
00:05:34,783 --> 00:05:38,495
To continue with your
duties as Vice Captain.

81
00:05:38,578 --> 00:05:41,373
We'll be dealing
with Spade soon,

82
00:05:41,456 --> 00:05:42,957
so I need you to
watch over the squa--

83
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:44,459
[LANGRIS]
I can't yet.

84
00:05:44,542 --> 00:05:47,170
Please just wait
a little longer.

85
00:05:51,966 --> 00:05:55,053
[door clicks]

86
00:05:59,057 --> 00:06:01,726
Has my brother
contacted you recently?

87
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,728
Oh, yes. Look.

88
00:06:03,812 --> 00:06:05,980
He writes to you?

89
00:06:06,064 --> 00:06:07,232
It's funny.

90
00:06:07,315 --> 00:06:10,610
He could use portals
to visit me anytime,

91
00:06:10,694 --> 00:06:13,988
but he's been sending letters
through them, instead.

92
00:06:14,072 --> 00:06:15,782
[LANGRIS] I'm sure he's trying
to put a little distance

93
00:06:15,865 --> 00:06:17,909
between you two
because he believes

94
00:06:17,992 --> 00:06:21,162
it's a part of his training.

95
00:06:21,246 --> 00:06:22,622

Do you have a cold?

97
00:06:26,876 --> 00:06:29,004
You're looking especially
lovely today, Noelle.

98
00:06:29,087 --> 00:06:30,672
Let's go for some tea.

99
00:06:30,755 --> 00:06:31,548
Huh?

100
00:06:31,631 --> 00:06:32,924
You have to stop,

101
00:06:33,008 --> 00:06:34,509
or you're never going to
break your curse, Finral!

102
00:06:34,592 --> 00:06:37,887
No, no, no, no, no, no!

103
00:06:37,971 --> 00:06:39,931
[LANGRIS]
What's he say in his letters?

104
00:06:40,015 --> 00:06:43,101
[FINNES] That he's going to
train in the Heart Kingdom soon.

105
00:06:43,184 --> 00:06:45,437
[LANGRIS]
He told you that?

106
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,313
[FINNES] If he has to
travel to another land,

107
00:06:47,397 --> 00:06:49,691
it must be for
something serious.

108
00:06:49,774 --> 00:06:51,860
Do you think there's going
to be another big battle?

Uh...

110
00:06:53,737 --> 00:06:56,281
[FINNES] I tried to get him
to tell me face-to-face.

111
00:07:00,744 --> 00:07:04,497
You know, since he's not
very good at keeping secrets.

112
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,002
[FINNES]
What's wrong, Langris?

113
00:07:10,128 --> 00:07:11,629
There's no need
to concern yourself

114
00:07:11,713 --> 00:07:13,590
with that, Lady Finnes.

115
00:07:15,508 --> 00:07:16,634
[LANGRIS]
Why the smile?

116
00:07:16,718 --> 00:07:18,678
[FINNES]
You can't hide things either.

Yes.

125
00:07:38,281 --> 00:07:40,700
You should go
back inside and rest.

126
00:07:40,784 --> 00:07:42,702
I'll take my leave now.

127

It's just my usual cough,
nothing too scary.

Either way, I've got
business to attend to today.

Oh, did you return to your
post as the vice captain?

[LANGRIS]
Goodbye. Thank you for the tea.

That's check.

I'm good with

Here comes Vice Captain Langris.

What's your problem?

I know you're jealous that Yuno
and I are the perfect couple,

00:08:49,144 --> 00:08:51,438
but that's no reason
to have such an attitude--

What's wrong?
You need something?

So, based on that, you and I
should be equally matched.

[knocking]

160
00:09:43,615 --> 00:09:45,367
[WILLIAM]
Come.

161
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:48,036
[ALECDORA]
Pardon me, sir.

162
00:09:48,119 --> 00:09:49,746
I had to tell you
that the vice captain

163
00:09:49,829 --> 00:09:52,499
just challenged Yuno to a duel.

164
00:09:52,582 --> 00:09:54,584
Did he really?

165
00:09:54,668 --> 00:09:56,753
It makes me nervous.

166
00:09:56,836 --> 00:09:59,089
I hope nothing terrible happens.

167
00:10:15,855 --> 00:10:18,108
I'll be with you
the whole time, Yuno.

168
00:10:18,191 --> 00:10:21,152
So trust me, you don't need
to worry about holding back!

169
00:10:21,236 --> 00:10:23,947
[LANGRIS] A normal sparring
session is no fun.

170
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:27,075
Let's spice it up.
How about this?

171
00:10:28,535 --> 00:10:31,162
The loser agrees to resign
from the Golden Dawn.

172
00:10:31,246 --> 00:10:34,666
[ALL gasping]

173
00:10:54,436 --> 00:10:57,355
[LANGRIS] Honestly.
What a vulgar bunch they are.

174
00:10:57,439 --> 00:11:00,442
You should really choose your
friends more carefully, Yuno.

175
00:11:03,653 --> 00:11:04,904
Aren't you embarrassed
to be seen

176
00:11:04,988 --> 00:11:06,865
with people like that?

177
00:11:06,948 --> 00:11:08,783
[YUNO]
Why would I be?

178
00:11:08,867 --> 00:11:10,785
I've never felt that way once.

179
00:11:10,869 --> 00:11:13,913
I'm very proud of Asta.
He's my rival.

180
00:11:13,997 --> 00:11:17,959
[laughs] A simpleton
like that's your rival?

181
00:11:18,043 --> 00:11:19,544
For what, anyway?

182
00:11:19,627 --> 00:11:22,005
Are you two in some
kind of competition?

183
00:11:22,088 --> 00:11:24,382
That's right, yes.

184
00:11:24,466 --> 00:11:27,761
We're aiming to become
the Wizard King.

185
00:11:27,844 --> 00:11:29,763
I don't know what your
problem is, Sir Smirky,

186
00:11:29,846 --> 00:11:32,307
but I don't let
anybody mock my Yuno--!

187
00:11:33,391 --> 00:11:35,143
[YUNO] There's no rule
saying that a commoner

188
00:11:35,226 --> 00:11:36,895
can't be the Wizard King.

189
00:11:36,978 --> 00:11:37,979
Huh?

190
00:11:38,063 --> 00:11:39,147
[YUNO]
First, of course,

191
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:42,776
I'll become captain
of the Golden Dawn.

192
00:11:42,859 --> 00:11:44,110
Will you?

193
00:11:44,194 --> 00:11:45,695
Have you forgotten the fact
that I'm our squad's

194
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:47,572
current vice captain?

195
00:11:50,617 --> 00:11:53,828
I believe you said,
before you're Wizard King,

196
00:11:53,912 --> 00:11:57,290
you want to be Captain
of our squad, yes?

197
00:11:57,374 --> 00:11:59,501
If you win, you'll be
forcing the vice captain

198
00:11:59,584 --> 00:12:01,753
to abandon the team,
which would put you

199
00:12:01,836 --> 00:12:03,797
one step closer to the top.

200
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,882
That's not such
a bad deal, is it?

201
00:12:05,965 --> 00:12:08,635
[YUNO]
Stop talking and let's go.

202
00:12:08,718 --> 00:12:11,513
He keeps adding more
and more fuel to the fire!

203
00:12:11,596 --> 00:12:13,932
I don't think they can
resolve this quickly.

204
00:12:14,015 --> 00:12:15,183
No.

205
00:12:15,266 --> 00:12:17,352
I have a feeling this
may get quite bloody.

206
00:12:17,435 --> 00:12:18,520
Let's make some bets!

207
00:12:18,603 --> 00:12:20,313
Why are you like this, David?

208
00:12:20,397 --> 00:12:22,107
We should stop them!

209
00:12:25,276 --> 00:12:27,112
Now, are you ready, Yuno?

210
00:12:27,195 --> 00:12:28,738
Let's begin!

211
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:35,495
He made the rock disappear!

212
00:12:35,578 --> 00:12:37,163
Talking won't solve this.

213
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:39,499
[gasps] Please stop it,
Vice Captain!

214
00:12:39,582 --> 00:12:41,251
He's out to kill. Why?

215
00:12:41,334 --> 00:12:44,295
Oh, dear. Looks like
you dodged it.

216
00:12:48,758 --> 00:12:50,635
[LANGRIS]
But I'll get you this time!

217
00:12:50,719 --> 00:12:54,180
[YUNO] Wind Creation Magic:
Wind Blade Shower!

218
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,149
Perhaps I was too careless.

219
00:13:08,194 --> 00:13:10,113
My goodness,
that's quite a scowl.

220
00:13:10,196 --> 00:13:12,949
I don't know why you've been
holding back on me so far,

221
00:13:13,033 --> 00:13:14,868
but I'd like you to stop it now.

222
00:13:14,951 --> 00:13:16,828
Oh? You think I've been
holding back, do you?

223
00:13:16,911 --> 00:13:18,413
[YUNO]
Of course.

224
00:13:18,496 --> 00:13:23,126
If you hadn't been, you would've
dodged that last spell easily.

225
00:13:23,209 --> 00:13:26,671
Langris. Fight me for real,
or you'll get hurt.

226
00:13:27,714 --> 00:13:29,215
This isn't right!

227
00:13:29,299 --> 00:13:33,219
Actually, I have a feeling Yuno
isn't doing that to provoke him.

228
00:13:33,303 --> 00:13:34,804
[LANGRIS]
What did you say to me?

229
00:13:34,888 --> 00:13:37,390
You want me to say it
slower for you?

230
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:41,227
I was giving you the
benefit of the doubt,

231
00:13:41,311 --> 00:13:43,813
but now I know you're
trying to insult me.

232
00:13:43,897 --> 00:13:46,191
I won't go easy on you anymore!

233
00:13:46,274 --> 00:13:48,026
It's that spell again!

234
00:13:48,109 --> 00:13:50,028
[MIMOSA] This is the same
spatial magic he used

235
00:13:50,111 --> 00:13:52,864
during the Royal Knights
Selection Exam.

236
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,535
I'll go all out! Happy now?

237
00:13:57,619 --> 00:14:01,206
[YUNO] Spirit Assimilation:
Spirit Dive!

238
00:14:05,585 --> 00:14:07,337
[LANGRIS]
Take this!

239
00:14:09,881 --> 00:14:13,093
[YUNO] Mana Zone:
Spirit's Hushed Dance.

240
00:14:13,176 --> 00:14:14,177
Incredible!

241
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,304
Yuno's really talented!

00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:18,139
[YUNO]
Spirit Storm!

243
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:29,192
I know this move!

244
00:14:29,275 --> 00:14:31,611
It's from when that elf
was possessing him!

245
00:14:31,695 --> 00:14:34,114
The auto-defense spell!

246
00:14:34,197 --> 00:14:35,990
He shouldn't be able
to use it anymore,

247
00:14:36,074 --> 00:14:39,077
now that he's been released
from the spirit's influence.

248
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,496
[LANGRIS] It's faint,
but I can still feel the mana

249
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:44,833
from the elf that was
reincarnated inside my body.

250
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:50,422
Well? You can't keep
dodging me forever!

[YUNO grunts]

252
00:15:05,311 --> 00:15:06,730
He just hit Yuno's crown!

253
00:15:06,813 --> 00:15:08,106
It's been destroyed!

254
00:15:08,189 --> 00:15:11,568
Can't you do anything
besides run away?

255
00:15:18,658 --> 00:15:21,161
It's all over!

256
00:15:24,122 --> 00:15:25,248

Wha--? How--? An afterimage?

00:15:39,846 --> 00:15:42,223
You're right. It <i>is</i> over.

261
00:15:42,307 --> 00:15:43,224
Oh, good.

262
00:15:43,308 --> 00:15:44,726
They both survived.

263
00:15:44,809 --> 00:15:47,228
But this means the
vice captain's leaving.

264
00:15:47,312 --> 00:15:49,230
You don't happen to
remember who I bet on?

265
00:15:49,314 --> 00:15:51,232
Don't know, don't care!

266
00:15:51,316 --> 00:15:53,318
So that's how it is.

267
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:06,206
[LANGRIS]
Don't just stand there.

268
00:16:06,289 --> 00:16:08,249
Go ahead, laugh at me.

269
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:11,336
I gave it all I had,
and you still won.

270
00:16:11,419 --> 00:16:15,548
You did get serious,
but not till it was half-done.

271
00:16:15,632 --> 00:16:18,259
Before that, you were
trying to lose.

272
00:16:18,343 --> 00:16:19,386
[GOLDEN DAWN gasps]

273
00:16:19,469 --> 00:16:22,430
Quite an accusation,
but you're right.

274
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:24,641
I wanted to let you
take me down.

275
00:16:24,724 --> 00:16:27,644
It was a plan for me to
resign with some dignity.

276
00:16:27,727 --> 00:16:30,105
But this... This is shameful.

277
00:16:30,188 --> 00:16:33,191
I lost, even without
holding back.

278
00:16:33,274 --> 00:16:36,111
[YUNO]
That isn't shameful at all.

279
00:16:36,194 --> 00:16:39,364
Do you think it was that easy
for me to win against you?

280
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:43,743
He brings up a good point.

281
00:16:43,827 --> 00:16:46,121
That's right, it was
a close battle.

282
00:16:46,204 --> 00:16:47,747
What makes you
think that matters?

283
00:16:47,831 --> 00:16:52,127
You just defeated me.
And that's all I care about!

284
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:53,837
Which means that
I'm going to walk away

285
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,881
from the Golden Dawn.
That's what we agreed upon.

286
00:16:56,965 --> 00:16:58,883
I never actually
agreed to those terms.

287
00:16:58,967 --> 00:17:01,720
Maybe you didn't
accept them, but I did.

288
00:17:04,472 --> 00:17:06,474
This is stupid!

289
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:09,894
[LANGRIS] Take good care
of the squad for me, Yuno.

290
00:17:09,978 --> 00:17:13,148
You're walking away now?

00:17:13,231 --> 00:17:16,026
Do you honestly feel like
you lost that battle?

292
00:17:17,485 --> 00:17:20,280
If you'd have gone
all out from the start,

293
00:17:20,363 --> 00:17:22,949
then you might've succeeded.

[LANGRIS] Forgive me for not
consulting you, Captain.

I'm not surprised.

299

You know, Langris,

300
00:17:54,814 --> 00:17:56,649
you didn't have to
resort to theatrics

301
00:17:56,733 --> 00:17:59,361
because you wanted to resign.

302
00:17:59,444 --> 00:18:01,237
[LANGRIS]
You saw through me, too?

303
00:18:01,321 --> 00:18:03,365
Sorry, that's the way I am.

304
00:18:03,448 --> 00:18:04,991
I'm well aware.

305

But, then, I also know that this
isn't the end of your journey.

What happened today
doesn't change the fact

that you're part

[LANGRIS]
Thank you very much.

309
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:19,089
I should go.

310
00:18:23,593 --> 00:18:26,846
I'll be waiting. We all will.

311
00:18:39,901 --> 00:18:42,779
[FINNES] Langris, why are
you dressed like that?

312
00:18:42,862 --> 00:18:45,031
I'm about to leave on a journey.

313
00:18:45,115 --> 00:18:46,491
What? So it's true then;

314
00:18:46,574 --> 00:18:48,618
you really did leave
the Golden Dawn.

Well, no, not entirely.

00:18:50,787 --> 00:18:54,499
I just made a silly promise,
and now I have to keep my word.

317
00:18:54,582 --> 00:18:55,917
[FINNES]
Oh.

318
00:18:56,001 --> 00:19:00,130
Good morning, Lady Finnes,
how are you? Uh, Langris?

319
00:19:00,213 --> 00:19:02,132
What are you wearing
that big cloak for?

320
00:19:02,215 --> 00:19:04,634
Let me guess, you wanted
to pay one final visit

321
00:19:04,718 --> 00:19:07,637
to Lady Finnes before you went
away for your training, right?

322
00:19:07,721 --> 00:19:10,974
Huh? Yeah. I did.

323
00:19:15,895 --> 00:19:18,648
I'll be the man who
makes Lady Finnes happy.

324
00:19:18,732 --> 00:19:20,025
I promise.

325
00:19:20,108 --> 00:19:22,944
Once I've become worthy,
I'm gonna come back for you.

326
00:19:24,779 --> 00:19:27,824
I guess I'm willing to wait,
but don't take too long.

327
00:19:29,284 --> 00:19:32,162
[LANGRIS] By the way, there's
something I forgot to tell you.

328
00:19:32,245 --> 00:19:33,455
[BOTH]
Huh?

329
00:19:33,538 --> 00:19:34,831
[LANGRIS]
Despite how you feel,

330
00:19:34,914 --> 00:19:37,459
I still haven't decided
to let you win her love.

331
00:19:37,542 --> 00:19:38,877
Uh--

332
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,045
Come, now.

333
00:19:40,128 --> 00:19:42,630
Just who do you think
you are, brother?

334
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:51,598
[LANGRIS] Wait and see.
Our battle is only beginning.

335
00:19:59,356 --> 00:20:01,274
You'll need energy to train
in the Heart Kingdom,

336
00:20:01,358 --> 00:20:02,901
so you gotta eat way more food!

337
00:20:02,984 --> 00:20:05,862
Gladly! This is great!

338
00:20:05,945 --> 00:20:07,781
I'm gonna be so sick.

339
00:20:07,864 --> 00:20:10,116
[SHEEP COOKS bleet]

340
00:20:11,201 --> 00:20:12,994
Is it just you three?

341
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:14,746
Yeah, Luck and Magna said
they were gonna wait

342
00:20:14,829 --> 00:20:17,332
and have their dinner later on,
if that's cool, sir!

343
00:20:17,415 --> 00:20:18,625
[YAMI]
Gotcha.

344
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:21,086
If you notice me, then
I'm sure you'll invite me

345
00:20:21,169 --> 00:20:24,005
to go to the Heart
Kingdom with you, too.

346
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:26,341
However, I plan to
improve my Curse Magic

347
00:20:26,424 --> 00:20:28,134
under my father's guidance.

348
00:20:28,218 --> 00:20:30,512
So I have to go back home now.

349
00:20:30,595 --> 00:20:33,431
It pains me,
but I cannot join you.

350
00:20:33,515 --> 00:20:35,767
I'll just leave
without being seen.

351
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:37,644
[NOELLE]
Where does it all go?!

352
00:20:39,187 --> 00:20:41,314
[MAGNA] Whoa, did someone
just walk past us?

353
00:20:41,398 --> 00:20:43,066
Nah, it was the wind.

354
00:20:43,149 --> 00:20:45,735
Oh, okay. Hey, Captain Yami!

355
00:20:45,819 --> 00:20:47,987
Did they say they'd
let me go or not?

356
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:54,744
Don't worry, Magna,

357
00:20:54,828 --> 00:20:56,830
they're all right with
you taggin' along.

358
00:20:56,913 --> 00:21:01,209
[gasps] Wow,
thanks a million, boss!

359
00:21:01,292 --> 00:21:03,503
[YAMI] You should thank
the Wizard King, not me.

360
00:21:03,586 --> 00:21:05,130
That's badass!

361
00:21:05,213 --> 00:21:07,132
I'm so happy you're
comin' with us, Magna!

362
00:21:07,215 --> 00:21:08,883
I appreciate it, pal!

363
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:11,469
Whoo, I could go for
a nice cold drink.

364
00:21:11,553 --> 00:21:12,679
Wait, what's that juice?

365
00:21:12,762 --> 00:21:14,472
You know, the tasty one
they have in Heart?

366
00:21:14,556 --> 00:21:15,890
[CHARMY]
Tasty?

367
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:17,851
Oh, are you talkin' about
the crimson orange juice?

368
00:21:17,934 --> 00:21:20,145
Right, I can't
wait to try that!

369
00:21:20,228 --> 00:21:22,814
I hear it gets sweeter when
you add your mana to it!

370
00:21:22,897 --> 00:21:24,566
[CHARMY]
It gets sweeter?

371
00:21:24,649 --> 00:21:25,650
Yeah, but if you're me,

372
00:21:25,734 --> 00:21:27,694
it just stays all sour
and disgusting!

373
00:21:27,777 --> 00:21:28,903
Quit crying,

374
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:30,447
at least you had me
there to fix it for you.

375
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:34,492
Anyway, you guys'll arrive
in the Heart Kingdom tomorrow.

376
00:21:34,576 --> 00:21:39,080
Make the Black Bulls proud
and push past your limits!

377
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:41,082
[GROUP]
Yes, sir!

378
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:44,127
[NOELLE] I'm going to
improve my magic ability

379
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:47,047
so that I can defeat
the devil Megicula!

[LANGRIS] "If You're Going
to Quit Being Vice Captain."

382
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:35,071
[LANGRIS] Forgive me for
not consulting you, Captain.

383
00:23:35,155 --> 00:23:38,199
Since you gave up your post,
you're on lunch duty.

384
00:23:38,283 --> 00:23:40,076
So you're still making me work?

385
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,579
You don't like it?
Then clean the chalkboard.

386
00:23:42,662 --> 00:23:45,457
The chalkboard?
That's just as terrible!

387
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,959
I can always put you
in charge of the animals.

388
00:23:48,043 --> 00:23:50,879
Since when do we have these?

389
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:51,880
You suck!

390
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:55,842
[yells]

391
00:23:57,469 --> 00:23:58,928
[ASTA]
Time to train!

392
00:23:59,012 --> 00:24:01,723
I'm gonna work so hard, I'll
have muscles on my muscles!

393
00:24:01,806 --> 00:24:03,391
[NOELLE]
Ugh, would you be quiet?

394
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:06,311
Try training your brain
for once, instead.
