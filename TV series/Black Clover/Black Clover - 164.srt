1
00:00:22,554 --> 00:00:25,765
[NARRATOR] Within the clover's
fifth leaf, there lives a devil.

2
00:00:27,225 --> 00:00:29,728
[NARRATOR] Asta, born
unable to harness mana,

3
00:00:29,811 --> 00:00:31,438
was granted the
power of Anti-magic

4
00:00:31,521 --> 00:00:33,231
from his five-leaf grimoire,

5
00:00:33,314 --> 00:00:37,068
giving him the ability
to nullify spells.

6
00:00:37,152 --> 00:00:39,738
Unfortunately, the members
of Spade Kingdom's

7
00:00:39,821 --> 00:00:42,449
Dark Triad also possess
powers from the devils

8
00:00:42,532 --> 00:00:44,284
of the underworld and used them

9
00:00:44,367 --> 00:00:47,662
to launch an invasion on
the neighboring countries.

10
00:00:47,746 --> 00:00:49,706
Gaining strength from
his belief in himself

11
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:51,791
and from the support
of his friends,

12
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:55,128
Asta continues to fight
for the safety of this world.

13
00:01:03,303 --> 00:01:05,472
I don't care how fast
or determined you are,

14
00:01:05,555 --> 00:01:07,182
it won't help you now.

15
00:01:08,308 --> 00:01:11,144
[SVENKIN]
Skin Magic: Skin Fort!

16
00:01:11,227 --> 00:01:14,105
[LUCK]
True Lightning Magic: Ceranos!

17
00:01:15,231 --> 00:01:17,776
[NARRATOR] Svenkin,
a Dark Disciple who attacked

18
00:01:17,859 --> 00:01:20,070
the Heart Kingdom
under Vanica's command,

19
00:01:20,153 --> 00:01:22,489
was soundly defeated by Luck.

20
00:01:24,616 --> 00:01:27,327
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, the Black
Bulls' hideout was ambushed

21
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:30,121
by Dante, one of the Dark Triad.

22
00:01:30,205 --> 00:01:33,416
[ASTA]
Don't do it!

23
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,418
--[VANESSA] Oh, no!
--[GREY] He hurt Gauche!

24
00:01:35,502 --> 00:01:37,128
[NARRATOR]
With an unknown spell,

25
00:01:37,212 --> 00:01:39,839
Grey rescued Gauche
from the brink of death.

26
00:01:39,923 --> 00:01:42,550
Grey...

27
00:01:42,634 --> 00:01:44,678
[VANESSA]
She sealed the wound!

28
00:01:44,761 --> 00:01:47,889
I didn't know her Transformation
Magic could do that!

29
00:01:50,183 --> 00:01:52,310
[VANESSA]
What is this spell?

30
00:01:53,812 --> 00:01:56,231
[ASTA roars]

31
00:01:56,314 --> 00:01:58,733
[NARRATOR] Asta was enraged
by his friends' suffering,

32
00:01:58,817 --> 00:02:00,944
and his devil's power
went berserk,

33
00:02:01,027 --> 00:02:03,113
but it wasn't enough
to stop Dante.

34
00:02:03,196 --> 00:02:09,369
[DANTE chuckles]
Magnificent!

35
00:02:09,452 --> 00:02:12,622
Yet another
arcane-stage fighter.

36
00:02:12,706 --> 00:02:14,791
[NARRATOR] Seeing Vanessa
and Grey's potential,

37
00:02:14,874 --> 00:02:16,668
Dante tried to take them.

38
00:02:16,751 --> 00:02:19,796
Then, Yami returned
to the hideout.

39
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:23,383
[YAMI]
Hey!

40
00:02:23,466 --> 00:02:28,054
That's my squad, so keep
your mitts off of 'em.

41
00:02:28,138 --> 00:02:31,808
[NARRATOR] But the captain had
been Dante's target all along.

42
00:02:31,891 --> 00:02:34,102
He believed Yami was
the key to connecting

43
00:02:34,185 --> 00:02:36,730
this world with the underworld.

44
00:02:36,813 --> 00:02:38,356
[YAMI]
If they're "arcane-stage,"

45
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,650
that's the first
I've heard about it.

46
00:02:40,734 --> 00:02:42,027
And they're not
here to serve me.

47
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:44,904
I just brought 'em on
because I liked 'em.

48
00:02:44,988 --> 00:02:47,866
[YAMI]
Mana Zone: Condense.

49
00:03:01,296 --> 00:03:04,049
[YAMI]
Dark Cloaked, Iai Slash.

50
00:03:04,132 --> 00:03:06,593
They're not going anywhere.

51
00:03:06,676 --> 00:03:09,095
Not with you, y'damn freak.

52
00:03:09,179 --> 00:03:10,764
[DANTE groans]

53
00:04:51,781 --> 00:04:53,908
[DEVIL]
Kill.

54
00:04:53,992 --> 00:04:56,828
I'll kill them. Kill them all!

55
00:04:56,911 --> 00:04:58,371
They must pay!

56
00:04:58,455 --> 00:05:00,623
Kill. Kill!

57
00:05:00,707 --> 00:05:03,877
Hold on. Killing?

58
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,129
[DEVIL]
Kill them all!

59
00:05:13,219 --> 00:05:16,264
[ASTA grunts]

60
00:05:16,348 --> 00:05:18,308
[ASTA]
What the heck just happened?

61
00:05:18,391 --> 00:05:21,311
My body won't move at all.

62
00:05:21,394 --> 00:05:23,813
Wait, what about Gauche?

63
00:05:25,231 --> 00:05:29,027
[ASTA sighs]
I can still sense his ki.

64
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:31,863
Good, he's alive!

65
00:05:33,073 --> 00:05:35,241
[ASTA]
That jerk from Spade.

66
00:05:41,623 --> 00:05:44,501
[YAMI] Using my Iai blade,
if I cast Mana Zone

67
00:05:44,584 --> 00:05:46,628
with condensed mana...

68
00:05:49,214 --> 00:05:51,675
[YAMI]
...then it'll never miss.

69
00:05:51,758 --> 00:05:56,137
[DANTE]
Oh... [chuckles]

70
00:05:56,221 --> 00:06:01,017
[DANTE laughs]

71
00:06:01,101 --> 00:06:02,394
I'm surprised.

72
00:06:02,477 --> 00:06:05,689
I never thought anyone would
make me use this magic.

73
00:06:08,233 --> 00:06:13,530
[DANTE laughs]

74
00:06:13,613 --> 00:06:17,075
[YAMI]
What in the world is he doing?

75
00:06:17,158 --> 00:06:18,284
[VANESSA]
This is completely different

76
00:06:18,368 --> 00:06:21,788
from the techniques
he was using before!

77
00:06:21,871 --> 00:06:23,665
What's going on?

78
00:06:23,748 --> 00:06:26,876
All this envy,
and rage, and hatred.

79
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,962
I can't get enough of it!

80
00:06:29,045 --> 00:06:32,298
Color me impressed,
Yami Sukehiro!

81
00:06:35,176 --> 00:06:40,223
[DANTE] I was bored with
absolutely everything.

82
00:06:44,144 --> 00:06:46,438
[DANTE] There was
nothing in this world...

83
00:06:46,521 --> 00:06:53,111
[CROWD cheering]

84
00:06:54,404 --> 00:06:58,158
[DANTE] ...that could slake
this extreme malice.

85
00:07:00,618 --> 00:07:02,078
Yami, my friend.

86
00:07:02,162 --> 00:07:05,457
Believe me, this is only the
beginning of what's in store.

87
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,585
You're going to open up a
brand-new world for me soon.

88
00:07:08,668 --> 00:07:10,920
Stop it, man,
you're creepin' me out.

89
00:07:11,004 --> 00:07:13,590
And that goatee looks awful.

90
00:07:13,673 --> 00:07:15,342
You said somethin' about
me bein' the key

91
00:07:15,425 --> 00:07:18,553
to the underworld, but I got no
idea what you're talkin' about.

92
00:07:18,636 --> 00:07:21,222
Pretty sure I'm not
that special, pal.

93
00:07:21,306 --> 00:07:23,266
Don't flatter yourself.

94
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:28,021
The key to the underworld
isn't you, per se.

95
00:07:28,104 --> 00:07:32,400
It's a magical channel
known as the Tree of Qliphoth.

96
00:07:32,484 --> 00:07:35,862
To bring that channel into
being, we need Dark Magic

97
00:07:35,945 --> 00:07:40,075
and World Tree Magic,
both at the arcane stage.

98
00:07:40,158 --> 00:07:41,701
Which means...

99
00:07:41,785 --> 00:07:47,082
...that the crucial players here
are you and William Vangeance.

100
00:07:47,165 --> 00:07:49,834
[YAMI] So, this guy knows
about William's magic.

101
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:51,670
All right, let's say
we do connect this world

102
00:07:51,753 --> 00:07:54,005
to the underworld,
then what happens?

103
00:07:54,089 --> 00:07:57,509
[DANTE] Then, this realm will
become infested with devils.

104
00:07:57,592 --> 00:07:59,010
[YAMI gasps]

105
00:07:59,094 --> 00:08:01,304
[DANTE]
And once they've taken over...

106
00:08:01,388 --> 00:08:03,056
[DANTE cackles]

107
00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:05,016
[DANTE]
...every possible kind of malice

108
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,143
will descend upon this land!

109
00:08:07,227 --> 00:08:15,694
[DANTE cackles]

110
00:08:15,777 --> 00:08:18,196
And that's sure to be
awfully entertaining.

111
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:20,865
Right, Yami Sukehiro?

112
00:08:22,242 --> 00:08:24,244
[YAMI]
That's it.

113
00:08:24,327 --> 00:08:26,121
No more chit-chat.

114
00:08:26,204 --> 00:08:28,957
I'm taking you down
here and now!

115
00:08:31,418 --> 00:08:33,837
These jerks are burning
the forest, which means

116
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,047
they're destroying the food,
and there's no way

117
00:08:36,131 --> 00:08:37,340
I'm gonna let that happen!

118
00:08:37,424 --> 00:08:38,508

00:08:48,893 --> 00:08:53,356
[HALBET giggles]
O lovely flames, engulf me

120
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,443
and my gorgeous

00:08:56,526 --> 00:08:59,195
[VILLAGER 164A]
No. The Polnfrume Forest.

122

[VILLAGER 164B]
We're done for!

123
00:09:02,699 --> 00:09:04,617
They took down
a Spirit Guardian!

124
00:09:04,701 --> 00:09:06,327
If Sir Potrof
hadn't shielded us,

125
00:09:06,411 --> 00:09:07,954
we would all be dead!

126

[HALBET]
Consider yourselves lucky.

127
00:09:10,373 --> 00:09:12,959
It's true that you're
about to die, but at least

128
00:09:13,043 --> 00:09:16,379
the immaculate beauty of
Dark Disciple Halbet Chevour

129
00:09:16,463 --> 00:09:18,757
is the last thing you'll see.

[CHARMY]
What do you think you're doing?

131
00:09:22,719 --> 00:09:24,846
Oh?

132
00:09:24,929 --> 00:09:29,059
It seems an unsightly

Sir Potrof! Charmy's here!

Hey, it's Charmy!

Well, how about that?

Did you sneak away
from your training again?

Do you wanna take a snack break?

talented you are!

Save us, Charmy!

Heh. Looks like your
magic is as soft as you.

Our spells are passing
right through each other.

147

Perhaps this is what they mean
when they say "affinity."

[GIANT SHEEP bleets]

But there's one major
difference here.

150
00:10:43,383 --> 00:10:45,260
[HALBET]
My magic is able to protect me

151
00:10:45,343 --> 00:10:47,637
from incoming attacks.

152
00:10:49,723 --> 00:10:52,142
[HALBET] But yours
doesn't shield you at all,

153
00:10:52,225 --> 00:10:54,602
so you're wide open!

Thanks to the devil's power,

of wiggling away from me.

160
00:11:13,663 --> 00:11:15,498
Why bother with food?

161
00:11:15,582 --> 00:11:17,876
Eating is a foolish
waste of time.

I've found all you really need
for maximum beauty and strength

163
00:11:21,212 --> 00:11:23,381
is the proper nutrition!

164

Anyway, your fatness
is an eyesore.

[CHARMY] This is what you get
for disrespecting food!

00:14:14,886 --> 00:14:17,138
The only way to get
true beauty and strength

202
00:14:17,222 --> 00:14:19,683
is from a balanced diet!

I don't think I've ever seen
a technique like that before.

How would you even dodge it?

210
00:14:39,744 --> 00:14:41,246
[TOWNSPERSON 164A] That young
man from the Clover Kingdom

[SIVOIR]
Well, he's resilient.

216
00:15:05,103 --> 00:15:08,440
That strike didn't
even pierce his body.

217
00:15:08,523 --> 00:15:10,567
But how long can he last?

218
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:13,862
His mana is dwindling
away by the second.

219

Wherever you run,
pathetic little neophyte,

you'll never escape
being riddled with holes

00:15:18,658 --> 00:15:21,619
by Dark Disciple Sivoir Snyle!

222
00:15:21,703 --> 00:15:23,413
[SIVOIR]
I'm using an Eye Magic spell

223
00:15:23,496 --> 00:15:26,082
called Catoblepas's Evil Eye.

224
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:29,377
My eyes are everywhere.
Not only can they track you,

225
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:32,630
but they gauge your
mana and stamina.

226
00:15:32,714 --> 00:15:35,342
And, by watching your
eyeline and muscle movement,

227
00:15:35,425 --> 00:15:38,136
I can predict what
you'll do next!

228
00:15:38,219 --> 00:15:40,096
Once I've locked onto my target,

229
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:43,933
I'll fire using the shells
that I make from condensed mana.

[LEOPOLD]
Floga's down.

00:15:58,823 --> 00:16:00,158
I think you'll get
better results

235
00:16:00,241 --> 00:16:02,744
if you try to focus
on your strengths.

My strengths? Like what?

237
00:16:05,705 --> 00:16:06,831
You're the kind of
person who has

238
00:16:06,915 --> 00:16:08,750
the strength to endure anything.

239
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:12,671
I mean, you're you, right?

to sharpen my senses!

Did you really think
that I wouldn't

245
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:34,734
be able to dodge that, you fool?

246

It doesn't matter
what clever tricks

taught you, it's no use!

[LEOPOLD grunts]

249
00:16:41,866 --> 00:16:42,992
[LEOPOLD]
It took him a little longer

250
00:16:43,076 --> 00:16:45,161
to throw something
at me this time.

251
00:16:45,245 --> 00:16:48,373
That's because he had to take
a second to evade my attack.

252
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:53,670
Feel free to keep moving
in closer all you want.

creating distance.

That's what I thought.

We're both moving, but we're
not any farther apart.

257
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,974
He's getting as far away
from me as possible,

258
00:17:06,057 --> 00:17:07,684
but staying in range to fight.

No one's ever been able
to injure me in a battle.

In fact, I've never
even felt any pain.

261
00:17:13,356 --> 00:17:15,942
So, a mere simpleton
like you would be foolish

262
00:17:16,026 --> 00:17:20,113
to believe he could land
a single hit against me.

263

[LEOPOLD grunts]
Don't give up.

I have to endure
until I bring him down!

You don't know when
to quit, do you?

It's true.

I may not have as much talent
as my older brother and sister.

But, with them to look up to,

272
00:17:46,514 --> 00:17:49,601
I've held strong and let
my inner flame keep blazing!

00:17:49,684 --> 00:17:51,728
You realize that
endurance isn't enough

to win, don't you?

275
00:17:53,938 --> 00:17:55,648

so that I could take
my time creating it.

your eyes on me.

Excellent fighting, everyone!

317
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:05,570
Yeah, whatever. I guess
they did all right.

318
00:20:05,653 --> 00:20:09,115
That was amazing. I'm so
happy they're all okay!

319
00:20:09,199 --> 00:20:10,825
[LOROPECHIKA] I'm grateful
they could defend the places

320
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:13,036
where my water couldn't reach.

321
00:20:14,537 --> 00:20:17,665
[LOROPECHIKA] No matter
how strong their foes are,

322
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:19,209
the Clover Kingdom Magic Knights

323
00:20:19,292 --> 00:20:23,129
evolve their skills to match,
even mid-combat!

324
00:20:26,049 --> 00:20:27,258
[ALL gasp]

325
00:20:27,342 --> 00:20:29,844
[ROBERO cackles]

326
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:31,012
[ALL gasp]

327
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:32,389
[ROBERO]
Oh, my!

328
00:20:32,472 --> 00:20:35,600
I sense the mana of some
delicious ladies in here!

329
00:20:35,684 --> 00:20:37,477
We knew you'd
show up eventually.

330
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,479
That's right, we're prepared!

331
00:20:40,814 --> 00:20:42,148
[ROBERO yelps]

332
00:20:46,361 --> 00:20:50,073
[MIMOSA] Plant Magic:
Magic Cannon Flower!

333
00:20:50,156 --> 00:20:53,159
[MIMOSA] Serves you right
for being creepy!

334
00:20:53,243 --> 00:20:55,787
That was a wonderful
technique, Mimosa!

335
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:57,205
It wouldn't have been possible

336
00:20:57,288 --> 00:20:59,207
without all that
mana you sent me!

337
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:00,375
[gasps]

338
00:21:06,673 --> 00:21:09,718
[VANICA]
Yoo-hoo!

339
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:12,679
[NOELLE]
This mana--it's so sinister!

340
00:21:12,762 --> 00:21:15,181
I haven't seen you in so long.

341
00:21:15,265 --> 00:21:17,183
So I came to play!

342
00:21:20,895 --> 00:21:24,441
Happy to see me,
little Loropechika?

343
00:22:57,283 --> 00:22:59,160
[FULL CAST]
Clover Clips!

344
00:23:01,037 --> 00:23:03,248
[LEOPOLD]
The Strength to Endure.

345
00:23:07,168 --> 00:23:08,169
I bet you're gettin' close

346
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:10,463
to the end of your
rope, huh, Charmy?

347
00:23:10,547 --> 00:23:12,298
The heck are
you talking about?

348
00:23:12,382 --> 00:23:14,134
This is easy-breezy!

349
00:23:14,217 --> 00:23:16,886
[ASTA] You don't need to
push yourself either, Leo.

350
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:18,179
Don't be ridiculous!

351
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:20,390
Floga showed me how
to maximize my endurance,

352
00:23:20,473 --> 00:23:23,643
and I'm gonna use those lessons
to defeat you. Wait and see!

353
00:23:23,727 --> 00:23:26,855
[ALL groaning]

354
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:27,939
[ASTA]
So hot!

355
00:23:28,023 --> 00:23:29,816
[LEOPOLD]
Need water!

356
00:23:31,026 --> 00:23:33,903
[ALL gasp]

357
00:23:36,156 --> 00:23:37,657
Go ahead and hop on out, Charmy.

358
00:23:37,741 --> 00:23:40,076
N-Nobody's gonna
judge you, I promise!

359
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,203
No way, you're the one
who needs to get out!

360
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:44,456
You look like a
big angry popsicle!

361
00:23:44,539 --> 00:23:47,709
[ASTA] L-Leo, didn't y-you say
you're not good with the c-cold?

362
00:23:47,792 --> 00:23:50,003
I've got the strength to endure!

363
00:23:50,086 --> 00:23:52,547
They're so lively!

364
00:23:57,052 --> 00:23:58,178
[LOROPECHIKA]
Vanica, I won't let you

365
00:23:58,261 --> 00:23:59,846
have your way any longer!

366
00:23:59,929 --> 00:24:03,641
Because now, I have friends
I can depend on to help!

367
00:24:03,725 --> 00:24:07,854
<i>Black Clover</i> , Page 165:
"Water Crusade."

368
00:24:07,937 --> 00:24:10,148
Today is the day
we end this fight!
