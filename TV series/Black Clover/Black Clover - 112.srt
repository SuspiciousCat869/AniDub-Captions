1
00:00:23,763 --> 00:00:25,682
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:25,765 --> 00:00:28,518
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:32,105 --> 00:00:34,399
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:34,482 --> 00:00:37,027
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:43,533 --> 00:00:45,535
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:45,618 --> 00:00:49,706
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:51,624 --> 00:00:53,752
[NARRATOR] To complete
the elves' reincarnation,

8
00:00:53,835 --> 00:00:56,546
Licht and his cohorts made
their way to the Shadow Palace,

9
00:00:56,629 --> 00:00:59,215
which lies between this
realm and the next.

10
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:01,968
At the conclusion of
this process, any humans

11
00:01:02,052 --> 00:01:03,970
whose bodies had been
possessed by the elves

12
00:01:04,054 --> 00:01:06,348
would be sent to
the other world.

13
00:01:06,431 --> 00:01:08,808
[YAMI]
Don't screw this up, ya hear me?

14
00:01:08,892 --> 00:01:11,061
I want you to surpass
your damn limits!

15
00:01:11,144 --> 00:01:13,313
--[HENRY] Gotcha!
--[GORDON] Understood, sir!

16
00:01:13,396 --> 00:01:15,565
[NARRATOR] Yami and Jack
set off after Licht

17
00:01:15,648 --> 00:01:17,567
while Asta and some
of the other Black Bulls

18
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:19,986
faced off with the elven
counterparts of Gauche

19
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,280
and his sister, Marie.

20
00:01:22,364 --> 00:01:24,949
Meanwhile, Vanessa,
Magna, Charmy, Sally,

21
00:01:25,033 --> 00:01:27,285
and Luck had been
taken to Glamour World,

22
00:01:27,369 --> 00:01:29,162
where they fought
a possessed Dorothy,

23
00:01:29,245 --> 00:01:33,416
captain of the Coral Peacocks
and user of Dream Magic.

24
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,959
[DOROTHY]
That's how it is.

25
00:01:35,043 --> 00:01:37,003
Everything that exists
in Glamour World

26
00:01:37,087 --> 00:01:39,005
will eventually get drowsy.

27
00:01:39,089 --> 00:01:41,216
[NARRATOR] Luckily, Dorothy's
magic has the ability

28
00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:43,301
to make anything materialize.

29
00:01:43,385 --> 00:01:45,470
which Sally used
to her advantage.

30
00:01:45,553 --> 00:01:49,391
[SALLY] What this world needs
most is an exit, exit, exit!

31
00:01:49,474 --> 00:01:51,309
Make one, please?

32
00:01:51,393 --> 00:01:53,436
Aw, hell yeah!

33
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,980
[NARRATOR] But, anyone who
looks into Marie's eyes

34
00:01:56,064 --> 00:01:58,608
will be rendered unable
to move, so Asta's team

35
00:01:58,692 --> 00:02:01,194
had a much more difficult
fight on their hands.

36
00:02:01,277 --> 00:02:03,613
Despite that, the
Black Bulls pressed on!

37
00:02:03,697 --> 00:02:06,491
[ASTA] I'm gonna stop
you two, no matter what.

38
00:02:06,574 --> 00:02:09,786
I will turn you back into
the normal Gauche and Marie!

39
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:12,747
[HENRY]
I'll save my friend! I swear!

40
00:02:12,831 --> 00:02:14,457
[yells]

41
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:15,959
[GAUCHE]
Since I know that form's secret,

42
00:02:16,042 --> 00:02:17,669
it won't be hard to defeat it.

43
00:02:17,752 --> 00:02:20,130
It can't resist strong magic.

44
00:02:22,132 --> 00:02:24,884
[ASTA] My sword's
reacting to the magic!

45
00:02:24,968 --> 00:02:27,345
[GAUCHE]
Just keep flyin' around.

46
00:02:27,429 --> 00:02:28,388
[BOTH]
Careful, Asta!

47
00:02:28,471 --> 00:02:30,390
[ASTA grunting]

48
00:04:03,775 --> 00:04:04,984
Sweet!

49
00:04:05,068 --> 00:04:06,778
That's more doors than
you can shake a stick at.

50
00:04:06,861 --> 00:04:09,114
Now let's pick one and
get the hell outta here!

51
00:04:09,197 --> 00:04:10,198
[CHARMY, LUCK, VANESSA, SALLY]
Yeah!

52
00:04:10,281 --> 00:04:11,950
And we can ride out on this!

53
00:04:12,033 --> 00:04:13,952
Ooh, that's a handy trick!

54
00:04:14,035 --> 00:04:16,371
Hey, Luck, do you think
you could give us a pull?

55
00:04:16,454 --> 00:04:17,622
You got it!

56
00:04:17,706 --> 00:04:19,207
[GROUP]
Here we go!

57
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:21,334
I think not.

58
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:22,919
[laughs]

59
00:04:23,003 --> 00:04:24,921
I love how she changes fate!

60
00:04:25,005 --> 00:04:26,673
That never gets old to me!

61
00:04:26,756 --> 00:04:30,218
Yeah, well, it always
gives me a heart attack!

62
00:04:30,301 --> 00:04:31,386
[CHARMY]
Go! Go!

63
00:04:31,469 --> 00:04:32,804
[VANESSA]
We're almost to the door now!

64
00:04:32,887 --> 00:04:34,889
Look! We're gonna make it!

65
00:04:38,393 --> 00:04:40,145
I can't get rid of them,

66
00:04:40,228 --> 00:04:42,814
but at least I can
seal them with chains.

67
00:04:42,897 --> 00:04:43,732
Huh?

68
00:04:43,815 --> 00:04:45,692
No. We're trapped!

69
00:04:45,775 --> 00:04:47,652
[LUCK]
Man, we were so close!

70
00:04:47,736 --> 00:04:50,572
You act like this is
some kinda stupid game!

71
00:04:50,655 --> 00:04:53,575
Damn it all! Coulda sworn
we were home free!

72
00:04:53,658 --> 00:04:56,411
I know, let's just
wish for another exit!

73
00:04:56,494 --> 00:04:58,163
Make us one more, would ya?

74
00:04:58,246 --> 00:05:00,165
Hate to say it,
Explosion Boy, but if she's

75
00:05:00,248 --> 00:05:01,833
concentrating that hard
on shutting them,

76
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:03,626
then we can't make another one.

77
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,503
[CHARMY] Well, I've got
a delicious meal here,

78
00:05:05,587 --> 00:05:07,839
so I'm just gonna
eat my feelings.

79
00:05:07,922 --> 00:05:09,841
That's your own
Cotton Magic, moron!

80
00:05:09,924 --> 00:05:12,177
Stay with us, Charmy,
if you fall asleep now,

81
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:15,221
then you'll never wake up again!

82
00:05:15,305 --> 00:05:17,557
Oh, no. We'd better
think of something quick,

83
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,060
or it's over for us.

84
00:05:20,143 --> 00:05:24,105
It seems like anything goes
in this crazy world.

85
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:25,440
Hey, I know!

86
00:05:25,523 --> 00:05:26,775
If there aren't
any rules in here,

87
00:05:26,858 --> 00:05:29,611
then why don't we just
make her fix this?

88
00:05:29,694 --> 00:05:32,155
Huh? What's that mean?

89
00:05:32,238 --> 00:05:34,074
We don't have time for
any of your goofy ideas--

90
00:05:34,157 --> 00:05:36,076
Just shut up for
a second, okay?

91
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:37,911
Argh, you little--!

92
00:05:37,994 --> 00:05:41,039
Can I run something by
you real quick, Sally?

93
00:05:41,122 --> 00:05:43,541
[LUCK whispering] First we're
gonna-- And then I think--

94
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:46,544
I see. That sounds like fun!

95
00:05:46,628 --> 00:05:49,381
Yeah, it's definitely
worth a try, at least!

96
00:05:49,464 --> 00:05:50,799
--[CHARMY] Yay!
--[MAGNA] Hold it!

97
00:05:50,882 --> 00:05:53,927
I need you to talk a lot
louder! This is exhausting!

98
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:56,137
If I say it louder,
she'll hear me.

99
00:05:56,221 --> 00:05:58,139
Okay, so do you have
any brilliant ideas

100
00:05:58,223 --> 00:05:59,432
for making my plan work?

101
00:05:59,516 --> 00:06:01,393
'Course I do!

102
00:06:01,476 --> 00:06:03,478
[DOROTHY] I don't know what
you're muttering about,

103
00:06:03,561 --> 00:06:07,023
but it's impossible for you
to escape from this place.

104
00:06:07,107 --> 00:06:09,943
You're doomed to sleep
for all eternity.

105
00:06:10,026 --> 00:06:11,277
Here goes!

106
00:06:11,361 --> 00:06:13,196
You're the first one up
to bat; don't let us down!

107
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:16,366
I got no clue what's
goin' on, but here goes!

108
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:20,620
Flame Magic: Time Bomb
Explosive Scattershot!

109
00:06:20,704 --> 00:06:24,958
[DOROTHY] Trying to hide from me
in my own domain? Fools.

110
00:06:26,543 --> 00:06:27,836
[DOROTHY gasps]

111
00:06:31,715 --> 00:06:33,341
[DOROTHY]
What's this?

112
00:06:33,425 --> 00:06:35,427
[SALLY] Unlike the things
your magic generates,

113
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:38,138
the stuff that we
create isn't real!

114
00:06:38,221 --> 00:06:40,056
[LUCK] We made a doll
from Charmy's cotton

115
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,516
and Vanessa's thread!

116
00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:43,768
[SALLY] Then we used
Explosion Boy's Flame Magic

117
00:06:43,852 --> 00:06:46,229
to produce a heat
mirage and blur it,

118
00:06:46,312 --> 00:06:49,024
which resulted in a fairly
convincing replica!

119
00:06:49,107 --> 00:06:50,442
For a moment...

120
00:06:50,525 --> 00:06:52,694
...you thought it might be real.

121
00:06:52,777 --> 00:06:56,072
[SALLY, LUCK]
Just like we wanted you to!

122
00:06:56,156 --> 00:06:58,074
[LUCK]
When I was being controlled,

123
00:06:58,158 --> 00:07:00,994
there were two connected
spirits inside my body.

124
00:07:01,077 --> 00:07:04,372
Me, and the elf who was
possessing me!

125
00:07:04,456 --> 00:07:06,249
I bet that doll makes
you think of her,

126
00:07:06,332 --> 00:07:08,168
whether you want to or not.

127
00:07:08,251 --> 00:07:10,670
How dare you?

128
00:07:10,754 --> 00:07:13,757
[LUCK] The real Dorothy
Unsworth is still in there!

129
00:07:14,758 --> 00:07:16,051
There she is!

130
00:07:16,134 --> 00:07:18,678
The Captain of the Coral
Peacocks makes her comeback!

131
00:07:18,762 --> 00:07:20,930
She's just the person we need!

132
00:07:21,014 --> 00:07:23,350
[LUCK laughs]
She's takin' a nap!

133
00:07:23,433 --> 00:07:24,267
[MAGNA]
Huh?

134
00:07:24,351 --> 00:07:25,810
[VANESSA]
Oh, that's right.

135
00:07:25,894 --> 00:07:27,645
She's a famously
frequent sleeper.

136
00:07:27,729 --> 00:07:29,522
[MAGNA] Crap, don't tell
me she already fell

137
00:07:29,606 --> 00:07:31,733
into that eternal slumber thing!

138
00:07:31,816 --> 00:07:32,984
[VANESSA]
She woke up!

139
00:07:33,068 --> 00:07:35,612
Quit goofin' off and get
us outta here, would ya?

140
00:07:35,695 --> 00:07:38,239
I can barely keep my eyes open!

141
00:07:38,323 --> 00:07:41,451
[DOROTHY] I take it you're the
ones who summoned me here?

142
00:07:41,534 --> 00:07:44,162
If so... that's fantastic!

143
00:07:44,245 --> 00:07:46,790
Good job putting that
plan together, everybody!

144
00:07:46,873 --> 00:07:48,458
Now, leave the rest to me!

145
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:50,794
After all, I'm a captain!

146
00:07:50,877 --> 00:07:52,796
[LUCK, MAGNA]
She's so chipper!

147
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,175
I have to ask, how old are you?
You look so young for a captain!

148
00:07:57,258 --> 00:08:00,512
I mean, I'm curious, too,
but I think that can wait.

149
00:08:00,595 --> 00:08:02,806
I'm 27 years old!

150
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:05,934
I know, I look incredible
for my age, right?

151
00:08:06,017 --> 00:08:07,602
No fair, that's my thing!

152
00:08:07,686 --> 00:08:10,063
She's even older than I am!

153
00:08:10,146 --> 00:08:14,693
That's enough. Sleep
within my soul once more!

154
00:08:14,776 --> 00:08:18,363
[laughs] But both of us have
finally found somebody

155
00:08:18,446 --> 00:08:20,532
we can share our dreams with!

156
00:08:20,615 --> 00:08:21,950
We should have some fun!

157
00:08:22,033 --> 00:08:24,285
I don't play with humans!

158
00:08:24,369 --> 00:08:25,537
[DOROTHY]
Take that!

159
00:08:27,205 --> 00:08:29,207
[laughs]

160
00:08:33,044 --> 00:08:33,962
[LUCK]
Whoa!

161
00:08:34,045 --> 00:08:35,338
That's crazy!

162
00:08:35,422 --> 00:08:38,258
Wow, the dream world
is really interesting!

163
00:08:38,341 --> 00:08:40,093
I wanna study it more!

164
00:08:40,176 --> 00:08:43,346
Ooh, that shark looks yummy!

165
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:44,681
[VANESSA]
Amazing!

166
00:08:44,764 --> 00:08:47,350
She's strong enough to
challenge her own elf form!

167
00:08:47,434 --> 00:08:50,478
Let's replenish our mana.
Hey, wanna cook?

168
00:08:50,562 --> 00:08:52,397
Always!

169
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,357
[VANESSA]
Now we can escape for sure!

170
00:08:54,441 --> 00:08:56,317
Be back soon, everyone!

171
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:02,907
[ASTA] I can't get close
enough to him! This sucks!

172
00:09:02,991 --> 00:09:07,245
Want to live? You better
close your eyes.

How am I supposed to--?

[ASTA yelps]

175
00:09:09,289 --> 00:09:10,415
Surrender, brat.

00:09:15,378 --> 00:09:17,255
Thanks for catchin' me!

179
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:19,758
We're transferring a bit
of our mana to Henry!

180
00:09:19,841 --> 00:09:21,051
More than a bit!

181
00:09:21,134 --> 00:09:23,887
He's absorbing our power
faster than normal!

182
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:27,349
Get inside! Hurry!

183
00:09:27,432 --> 00:09:30,143
[ASTA]
I'm doin' my best!

184
00:09:30,226 --> 00:09:31,144
[ASTA]
At this point,

185
00:09:31,227 --> 00:09:32,687
I can only use my
dark form about

186
00:09:32,771 --> 00:09:34,647
two and a half more times!

187
00:09:34,731 --> 00:09:36,358
And I used it once
before I got here,

188
00:09:36,441 --> 00:09:38,276
so it won't work for long!

[BLACK BULLS yell]

Here we go!

Sorry, that's not good enough.

195
00:09:51,831 --> 00:09:54,918
You didn't mirror the parts
that are expelling the magic.

I'm in range!

This is where we say goodbye.

199
00:10:02,592 --> 00:10:04,886
Wait! What's Henry doing?

200
00:10:13,436 --> 00:10:15,563
[HENRY]
This is where we say goodbye.

201
00:10:15,647 --> 00:10:18,066
Wait! What's Henry doing?

202
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,570
[GAUCHE]
You're killing yourself?

203
00:10:22,654 --> 00:10:24,781
And you plan to take
me down with you?

204
00:10:24,864 --> 00:10:26,324
[HENRY]
Not quite.

205
00:10:28,368 --> 00:10:30,286
[HENRY]
This'll only kill me.

206
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:32,205
Protecting my friends
is the one reason

207
00:10:32,288 --> 00:10:34,374
I've survived till now.

208
00:10:34,457 --> 00:10:36,126
What is this?

209
00:10:36,209 --> 00:10:39,045
[GAUCHE]
My mana's draining.

210
00:10:39,129 --> 00:10:41,256
Outside the hideout,
I absorb magic

211
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:42,882
at a much higher rate.

212
00:10:42,966 --> 00:10:47,429
And this isn't a spell, so her
ability can't cancel it out!

213
00:10:47,512 --> 00:10:50,432
It's no use, human.
My power is immense.

214
00:10:50,515 --> 00:10:53,435
I've got more than
enough to spare!

215
00:10:53,518 --> 00:10:55,645
So you'll die for nothing.

216
00:10:55,729 --> 00:10:59,149
[HENRY] Fine by me.
My job is done, anyway.

217
00:10:59,232 --> 00:11:02,110
I'm just happy I could
fight with my friends.

218
00:11:02,193 --> 00:11:07,323
I'm sure they'll find some way
to stop you once I'm gone. Now.

[HENRY]
It's... your... turn!

You're not even close
to done, Henry! Don't die!

221
00:11:18,877 --> 00:11:20,337
Hi, Henry!

222
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:23,715
You're the guy with that illness
that sucks up magic, right?

223
00:11:23,798 --> 00:11:26,509
I'm Asta! The newest
member of the Black Bulls!

224

The captain told me
about this place

225
00:11:28,011 --> 00:11:30,055
after I found it by accident!

226
00:11:30,138 --> 00:11:33,600
But I don't have magic,
so don't you worry!

227
00:11:33,683 --> 00:11:34,851
You're embarrassed
to meet 'em

228
00:11:34,934 --> 00:11:37,103
'cause you always take
their mana? It's fine!

229
00:11:37,187 --> 00:11:39,689
Seriously, nobody's gonna
get upset at you for that!

230
00:11:39,773 --> 00:11:41,191
This team is full of weirdos!

We all have our own quirks,
so you'll fit right in here!

Maybe once I get a good handle

233
00:11:46,154 --> 00:11:48,865
on my magic absorption...

234
00:11:48,948 --> 00:11:56,748
Okay! One day... I'll say...
hi... to my... squad!

Sounds good, buddy!
We'll be waitin' for ya!

236

It'll be even more fun once
you meet the squad in person!

It's like a dream.

Before I met them,
I was all by myself.

I'd live. But now...

I can't get it to work!

[GAUCHE] This goes against
the laws of nature!

00:13:25,045 --> 00:13:28,923
Why? Is it because of
a human magic item?

[GAUCHE gasps]
That's...

to spill our elven blood!

They slaughtered our kind
out of pure greed,

and then their rotten minds
twisted the truth

beyond recognition, allowing
them to be angry at us!

repulsive laughter.

What they did to us was
sick and unforgivable!

My rage will not
be satisfied until

291

every last one of them
is torn to shreds.

[GAUCHE] But, these humans...
They aren't like them.

They're fighting
for their friends,

the same as my people
fought for each other.

I'm sorry.

297
00:14:54,259 --> 00:14:56,761
At this rate, my malice
will take over completely,

298
00:14:56,845 --> 00:15:01,516
and I won't be myself at all
anymore. Do as you will.

Please forgive me, Eclat.

Brother. I love you.

301
00:15:06,271 --> 00:15:09,399
I want you to stay
by my side forever!

302
00:15:13,028 --> 00:15:17,032
I have no choice.
I need my friends back.

303
00:15:21,411 --> 00:15:24,956
[GAUCHE] That sword. It even
erases the forbidden magic.

[GAUCHE]
Oh, well.

I know Patry and
Rhya worked hard,

but I'm afraid I have
to let you all down.

308
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:37,552
This is where it ends for me.

309
00:15:37,635 --> 00:15:40,472
We never should have used
that forbidden spell.

310
00:15:43,308 --> 00:15:46,728
A power that could make it
so something never happened.

311
00:15:46,811 --> 00:15:48,855
Do you think that exists?

00:15:53,276 --> 00:15:56,112
there must always
be consequences.

00:15:56,196 --> 00:16:00,784
You should do your best
to remember that, human.

I know. I'll never forget
you two. Goodbye.

[GAUCHE]
You couldn't be more right.

There isn't a single

No matter how close you get,

they're still strangers.

320

Everyone puts themselves first

00:16:32,482 --> 00:16:35,318
and tries to make
their own life easier.

They'll betray you without
a moment's hesitation.

I'm no different.

As long as Marie

that was all that mattered.

You almost died
for someone else!

And now, our hideout

In fact, if I'm being honest,

I've never trusted anyone
