[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

00:00:32,105 --> 00:00:34,399
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:43,491 --> 00:00:45,493
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:45,577 --> 00:00:49,497
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:55,003
[NARRATOR] The devil possessing
Ronne took on its true form.

8
00:00:55,086 --> 00:00:57,130
It then revealed its role
in the massacre

00:00:57,213 --> 00:00:59,132
and resurrection of the elves.

10
00:00:59,215 --> 00:01:01,217

00:01:16,941 --> 00:01:19,736

[ASTA]
I've seen this before.

24
00:03:13,141 --> 00:03:16,311
It's the spell that almost took
out me and Captain Yami.

25
00:03:16,394 --> 00:03:19,022
Only this time,
it's even stronger.

Gauche came in and saved us
with his mirror magic back then.

That was a close call.

That spell was strong.

46
00:04:21,835 --> 00:04:24,170

It just keeps welling up.

You have no chance
of besting me alone.

72
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:38,244
[NARRATOR] A conflict
between wizards is decided

73
00:05:38,328 --> 00:05:40,580
by more than raw power.

74
00:05:40,663 --> 00:05:41,873
Some types of magic have

75
00:05:41,956 --> 00:05:44,376
intrinsic advantages
over others.

76
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:46,878
This is why Magic Knights
work in teams,

77
00:05:46,961 --> 00:05:49,673
to cover for each
other's weaknesses.

But Nozel Silva is an exception.

79
00:05:52,384 --> 00:05:55,637
His all-purpose magic makes
him a team unto himself.

80
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,806
With his ever-changing mercury,
he's able to adapt

to any situation,
and compete with any foe.

Your Light Magic is formidable.

00:06:07,691 --> 00:06:10,860
But my mercury
counters it perfectly.

85
00:06:10,944 --> 00:06:14,489
[NARRATOR] Nozel's magic is both
powerful and sophisticated.

86
00:06:14,572 --> 00:06:16,825
He creates a vast
amount of mercury,

87
00:06:16,908 --> 00:06:19,619
then hardens it into
mirror-like shields.

88
00:06:19,703 --> 00:06:20,995
That being said,

89
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:23,123
I don't exactly plan
on losing to the man

whose magic
counters mine, either.

00:06:26,126 --> 00:06:28,878
In the meantime, I've been
sharpening my skills,

waiting for the chance
to avenge him.

00:06:46,855 --> 00:06:49,399
He might be a cold-hearted

His technique's incredible!

Still though, something's
up with that elf guy.

98
00:06:57,824 --> 00:07:00,118
How is he able to move
that quickly after unleashing

99
00:07:00,201 --> 00:07:01,703
all of that power?

power and focus I can muster.

I couldn't use it in
the last battle because

attack from any angle.

00:17:49,684 --> 00:17:53,438
No way am I lettin' that evil
lunatic get what he wants!

324
00:18:01,196 --> 00:18:03,323
[KOTODAMA DEVIL chuckling]

325
00:18:03,406 --> 00:18:05,116
I guess this is it.

326
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,994
The door to the outside.

327
00:18:08,078 --> 00:18:09,496
Now, then.

328
00:18:09,579 --> 00:18:10,705
Heh, heh.

329
00:18:15,168 --> 00:18:16,086
Not yet.

330
00:18:16,169 --> 00:18:18,672
Face me, demon.

331
00:18:18,755 --> 00:18:21,132
[KOTODAMA DEVIL] Look at you,
lobbing threats at me

332
00:18:21,216 --> 00:18:23,093
when you're not
even fully awakened.

333
00:18:23,176 --> 00:18:25,470
Seems somebody's
holding a grudge.

334
00:18:25,553 --> 00:18:26,846
[laughs]

335
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:28,890
I suppose I can't blame you.

336
00:18:28,973 --> 00:18:31,935
We have quite a tumultuous
history, and now I've taken

337
00:18:32,018 --> 00:18:35,689
the grimoire of someone very
dear to you and made it my own.

338
00:18:38,274 --> 00:18:40,318
Ooh! I didn't expect you to have

339
00:18:40,402 --> 00:18:42,987
so much fight left in you,
since your soul's still unstable

340
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,614
after spawning that demon.

341
00:18:44,698 --> 00:18:46,199
[laughs]

342
00:18:46,282 --> 00:18:47,617
I'm impressed!

343
00:18:47,701 --> 00:18:50,036
As a reward
for your hard work...

344
00:18:51,162 --> 00:18:53,748
[KOTODAMA DEVIL] ...I'm going
to give you a proper death!

345
00:18:55,417 --> 00:18:56,960
"Lightning Lance"!

346
00:19:01,798 --> 00:19:03,174
And "Earth Shield"!

347
00:19:03,258 --> 00:19:04,259
Hah!

348
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:07,262
Now "Tempest of Blades"!

349
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:13,601
"Split him open."

350
00:19:17,397 --> 00:19:19,691
[KOTODAMA DEVIL]
Next up, a-here's "Bind"!

351
00:19:22,944 --> 00:19:26,197
That sword can
absorb magic, but sadly,

352
00:19:26,281 --> 00:19:28,199
I imagine it doesn't
offer much protection

353
00:19:28,283 --> 00:19:30,827
against more concrete attacks!

354
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:32,954
Like this "Iron Lance."

355
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:34,914
With the use of Word Soul Magic,

356
00:19:34,998 --> 00:19:38,043
I can make anything happen
by speaking it into existence,

357
00:19:38,126 --> 00:19:41,338
and I can also summon
physical matter!

358
00:19:41,421 --> 00:19:43,465
Look at you with
your little sword.

359
00:19:43,548 --> 00:19:45,425
You're no threat to me at all!

360
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:50,221
[KOTODAMA DEVIL]
Goodbye, leader of the elves!

361
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:02,817
Oh, my. Seems we have an elf

362
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:05,528
who wasn't an
Apostle of Sephira.

363
00:20:05,612 --> 00:20:08,365
[CHARLOTTE] I noticed Baval
heading into the Shadow Palace,

364
00:20:08,448 --> 00:20:10,950
so I decided to follow him.

365
00:20:11,034 --> 00:20:13,661
When I got inside and
found him unconscious,

366
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:16,122
I knew that something
must have gone wrong.

367
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:21,127
Devil! I'll stop you!

368
00:20:21,211 --> 00:20:23,296
[YAMI]
Did you say devil?

369
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,048
I'm not so sure.

370
00:20:25,131 --> 00:20:29,719
I mean, if devils are even
a real thing, he's not one.

371
00:20:29,803 --> 00:20:31,721
He's way too wimpy.

372
00:20:31,805 --> 00:20:33,348
[cackles]

373
00:20:33,431 --> 00:20:35,642
[YAMI] Looks like Nozel went
toward that other strong magic

374
00:20:35,725 --> 00:20:38,728
I sensed, so I'm glad
I came this way.

375
00:20:38,812 --> 00:20:41,648
Somethin' crazy's goin'
on with his ki.

376
00:20:41,731 --> 00:20:43,108
[KOTODAMA DEVIL chuckles]

377
00:20:43,191 --> 00:20:44,984
So many of you!

378
00:20:45,068 --> 00:20:47,737
We've got ourselves
a party. [laughs]

379
00:20:47,821 --> 00:20:50,615
[YAMI]
Man, this guy reeks of malice!

380
00:20:50,699 --> 00:20:51,825
Human.

381
00:20:51,908 --> 00:20:55,662
You came this far
just to get in my way?

382
00:20:55,745 --> 00:20:58,581
[YAMI] Can we skip the playful
banter and get this done?

383
00:20:58,665 --> 00:21:00,750
I don't have time to listen
to you flatter yourself.

384
00:21:00,834 --> 00:21:04,087
You're obviously not the
biggest baddie in the room.

385
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:05,338
[CHARLOTTE]
Hmph.

386
00:21:06,214 --> 00:21:08,842
If you can't keep up
with me, I'm letting you die.

387
00:21:08,925 --> 00:21:10,135
[YAMI] Hey, now you're
startin' to sound like

388
00:21:10,218 --> 00:21:12,303
the prickly princess I remember.

389
00:21:12,387 --> 00:21:15,181
Try to keep her body in one
piece till she gets back.

390
00:21:15,265 --> 00:21:17,100
Now, "Wave of Flame"!

391
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:20,020
Hah!

392
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,691
[YAMI]
Dark Magic: Black Hole.

393
00:21:24,774 --> 00:21:27,027
Dark Cloaked Lightless Slash!

394
00:21:28,695 --> 00:21:30,572
[KOTODAMA DEVIL]
"Tempest of Blades."

395
00:21:30,655 --> 00:21:31,781
[CHARLOTTE growls]

396
00:21:35,285 --> 00:21:36,911
"Wither, vines"!

397
00:21:41,374 --> 00:21:42,375
[YAMI]
Dark Cloaked.

398
00:21:42,459 --> 00:21:44,044
Dimension Slash!

399
00:21:45,628 --> 00:21:47,922
My! [laughs]

400
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:50,216
What masterful teamwork!

401
00:21:51,426 --> 00:21:52,927
And here I thought
you two wouldn't be

402
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:55,305
on the best of terms right now.

403
00:21:55,388 --> 00:21:57,599
I'm as shocked as you are.

404
00:23:29,149 --> 00:23:30,191
[FINRAL]
Here we go!

405
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:31,901
Clover Cli--!

406
00:23:31,985 --> 00:23:33,486
No, no, I keep
telling you ladies,

407
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:35,822
we're supposed to do it
in unison! Here goes!

408
00:23:35,905 --> 00:23:37,907
[MAGIC KNIGHT 116A]
Yeah. I think he's fine.

409
00:23:37,991 --> 00:23:40,827
He's our savior. We need
to be careful with him.

410
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:43,163
Hm? What's with that bird?

411
00:23:43,246 --> 00:23:45,373
[screams]

412
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:47,709
'Kay, okay, we can
take a quick break!

413
00:23:47,792 --> 00:23:49,294
Huh? Nero?

414
00:23:50,545 --> 00:23:52,380
The old demon's bones.

415
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:53,798
Take me there.

416
00:23:56,593 --> 00:23:58,053
[FINRAL]
Nero can talk?!

417
00:23:58,136 --> 00:24:00,555
Then again, I was out cold,
so maybe I was just dreaming.

418
00:24:00,638 --> 00:24:03,933
Can somebody please
pinch my cheek really hard?

419
00:24:04,017 --> 00:24:07,270
<i>Black Clover</i> , Page 117:
"Breaking the Seal."

420
00:24:07,354 --> 00:24:10,482
Ow! Nope, not a dream!
Nero can talk!
