1
00:00:22,595 --> 00:00:24,139
[NARRATOR]
The Clover Kingdom.

2
00:00:24,222 --> 00:00:26,641
In this place where
magic is everything,

3
00:00:26,725 --> 00:00:29,561
there lives one boy
who was born without it.

4
00:00:29,644 --> 00:00:31,938
His name is Asta.

5
00:00:33,398 --> 00:00:34,816
[NARRATOR]
His strength and determination

6
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:37,152
helped him become
a Magic Knight.

7
00:00:37,235 --> 00:00:39,821
And despite the many
challenges he faces,

8
00:00:39,904 --> 00:00:43,616
he aims for the top
and refuses to give up!

9
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,285
Rich or poor,

10
00:00:45,368 --> 00:00:47,454
royalty or commoner,

11
00:00:47,537 --> 00:00:50,331
Asta believes anyone can shine.

12
00:00:50,415 --> 00:00:53,335
His mission is to prove
that to the whole world,

13
00:00:53,418 --> 00:00:56,421
and to become the
next Wizard King!

14
00:02:28,388 --> 00:02:32,142
[mumbling] No.
I can never go home.

15
00:02:32,225 --> 00:02:33,935
Damn, you're spooky.

16
00:02:35,562 --> 00:02:38,023
The Prickly Princess brought
you up when we had dinner.

17
00:02:38,106 --> 00:02:39,691
Your family's famous, right?

18
00:02:39,774 --> 00:02:41,985
On account of the magic
curse they work with?

19
00:02:42,068 --> 00:02:45,739
I need you to pick their brains
for info on forbidden curses.

20
00:02:45,822 --> 00:02:49,492
[mumbling] You want me to ask
about forbidden curses?

21
00:02:49,576 --> 00:02:50,618
Yeah.

22
00:02:50,702 --> 00:02:52,370
It could help us
to clear Asta's name.

23
00:02:52,454 --> 00:02:55,040
These are spells that warp
our world and ruin lives

24
00:02:55,123 --> 00:02:57,500
through otherworldly power.

25
00:02:57,584 --> 00:03:00,879
Specifically, power borrowed
from the world of devils.

26
00:03:00,962 --> 00:03:05,508
We need to learn as much
about them as we possibly can.

27
00:03:05,592 --> 00:03:07,302
[mumbling] If our
investigation into the devils

28
00:03:07,385 --> 00:03:11,848
doesn't progress,
then Asta could be...

29
00:03:13,266 --> 00:03:15,477
[GORDON]
I'll do it, Captain.

30
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:19,522
I'm expecting to fail,
but I'll try regardless.

31
00:03:19,606 --> 00:03:22,108
For the sake of my best friend.

32
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,863
[GORDON] Most people are
wary of curse mages.

33
00:03:26,946 --> 00:03:30,241
And I was born into a
distinguished family of them.

34
00:03:30,325 --> 00:03:34,287
So I never had any friends.

35
00:03:34,371 --> 00:03:37,499
And it's not like
I'm close to my family.

36
00:03:37,582 --> 00:03:39,417
Back when Asta's arms
had been cursed

37
00:03:39,501 --> 00:03:41,753
by a member of the Third Eye.

38
00:03:41,836 --> 00:03:44,172
I wrote them asking
how to break the spell,

39
00:03:44,255 --> 00:03:46,633
and they wouldn't say.

40
00:03:46,716 --> 00:03:48,927
Still, things are different now.

41
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:53,306
I have my friends with me,
so I feel more confident.

42
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:57,769
[ASTA screaming] Both of
my arms're fallin' asleep!

43
00:03:57,852 --> 00:03:59,437
But I'm not done yet, ya hear?

44
00:03:59,521 --> 00:04:03,108
My muscles are screaming
in joy; they love the pain!

45
00:04:03,191 --> 00:04:04,442
Nobody cares.

46
00:04:04,526 --> 00:04:06,611
The only person who can
ride at my back is Marie.

47
00:04:06,695 --> 00:04:08,238
So shut your mouth and hang on.

48
00:04:08,321 --> 00:04:10,323
Wait, so we're
meeting new people?

49
00:04:10,407 --> 00:04:12,200
I feel embarrassed already.

50
00:04:12,283 --> 00:04:14,953
[GORDON]
My friends give me strength.

51
00:04:15,036 --> 00:04:16,371
By the way, I want
you guys to know

52
00:04:16,454 --> 00:04:19,332
how grateful I am that
you all agreed to do this.

53
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:22,210
What? Who says I "agreed"?

54
00:04:22,293 --> 00:04:24,379
Noelle's makin' her way
to the royal capital,

55
00:04:24,462 --> 00:04:26,464
and I'd say that you three
need a reason to wipe

56
00:04:26,548 --> 00:04:30,010
the sleep from your eyes,
so go with your pal, Gordon.

57
00:04:30,093 --> 00:04:33,471
I know I'm not gonna do it.
Refuse 'n I'll kill ya.

58
00:04:33,555 --> 00:04:35,473
[GAUCHE]
Talk about an abuse of power.

59
00:04:35,557 --> 00:04:37,976
So, Gordon, I hear that your
family's a pretty big deal,

60
00:04:38,059 --> 00:04:41,229
like they're super famous
for their Curse Magic.

61
00:04:41,312 --> 00:04:45,025
No offense, but I don't actually
know what a curse mage does.

62
00:04:45,108 --> 00:04:47,068
Curse mages.

63
00:04:47,152 --> 00:04:48,987
Well, they specialize
in suffering.

64
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:52,782
Their trade is the infliction of
pain and misfortune upon others.

65
00:04:52,866 --> 00:04:55,035
I never wanted
any part of that.

66
00:04:55,118 --> 00:04:56,661
I wanted to make
friends with people,

67
00:04:56,745 --> 00:05:00,290
not to cast curses
on them. So...

68
00:05:00,373 --> 00:05:03,793
I left that house behind me
and rarely looked back.

69
00:05:03,877 --> 00:05:06,087
That's crazy. I had no idea.

70
00:05:06,171 --> 00:05:07,881
You ran away from home?

71
00:05:07,964 --> 00:05:10,675
Do you think they'll still
be willing to talk to you?

72
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:14,054
Oh, and how about some assurance
that we won't get cursed?

73
00:05:14,137 --> 00:05:16,514
I could get cursed
by a total stranger?

74
00:05:16,598 --> 00:05:18,099
How embarrassing.

75
00:05:18,183 --> 00:05:21,102
It's the curse part you
should be worried about.

76
00:05:21,186 --> 00:05:23,938
[GORDON]
It'll be okay. I think.

77
00:05:24,022 --> 00:05:25,565
[ASTA, GREY, GAUCHE]
You think?

78
00:05:35,617 --> 00:05:37,786
[GROUP]
I wanna go home.

79
00:05:37,869 --> 00:05:39,329
Let's do this.

80
00:05:44,209 --> 00:05:46,086
[GAUCHE] Their house
looks pretty haunted.

81
00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:48,797
[GREY] Getting spied on by a
ghost would be so humiliating.

82
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,175
Damn it, Grey.
Get off me, will ya?

83
00:05:52,258 --> 00:05:54,135
Now that I'm here,
I'm actually kind of excited

84
00:05:54,219 --> 00:05:56,846
to see what your
family's like, Gordon.

85
00:05:58,181 --> 00:06:01,226
[GORDON]
It's me. I'm home.

86
00:06:08,274 --> 00:06:10,068
[ALL gasp]

87
00:06:10,151 --> 00:06:12,821
[whispering] It's wonderful
to have you back, Gordon.

88
00:06:12,904 --> 00:06:14,072
[muttering] Hello, Big Brother.

89
00:06:14,155 --> 00:06:15,115
[muttering] Well, look at that.

90
00:06:15,198 --> 00:06:17,283
You decided to come
home after all.

91
00:06:17,367 --> 00:06:18,660
[NILENIA grunts]

92
00:06:18,743 --> 00:06:21,246
[ASTA, GREY, GAUCHE]
They all look exactly the same!

93
00:06:21,329 --> 00:06:22,997
Let me introduce you.

94
00:06:23,081 --> 00:06:25,834
First, this is
my father, Nathan.

95
00:06:25,917 --> 00:06:28,044
That's my mother, Jonna.

96
00:06:28,128 --> 00:06:30,422
My grandmother, Nilenia.

97
00:06:30,505 --> 00:06:32,382
My little sister, Roxanne.

98
00:06:32,465 --> 00:06:33,758
And...

99
00:06:33,842 --> 00:06:36,469
[ASTA screams]
We're under attack everyone!

100
00:06:36,553 --> 00:06:38,054
[GORDON]
That's our dog, Nunnally.

101
00:06:38,138 --> 00:06:39,597
[GAUCHE, GREY]
Even the dog looks like them.

102
00:06:39,681 --> 00:06:40,640
[ALL]
No.

103
00:06:40,724 --> 00:06:42,684
[JONNA]
She's mauling another guest.

104
00:06:42,767 --> 00:06:44,269
--[GAUCHE] Whoa, back it up!
--[GREY] Please don't curse me.

105
00:06:44,352 --> 00:06:46,354
Don't all of you come
over here at once.

106
00:06:47,897 --> 00:06:49,858
I'm sorry. You okay?

107
00:06:49,941 --> 00:06:51,234
Uh. Yeah.

108
00:06:51,317 --> 00:06:53,069
Sorry about the
late introduction.

109
00:06:53,153 --> 00:06:55,155
My name is Asta.

110
00:06:55,238 --> 00:06:56,823
The girl with her
face covered is Grey,

111
00:06:56,906 --> 00:06:58,783
and that's Gauche next to her.

112
00:06:58,867 --> 00:07:01,077
We're all in the same
Magic Knight Squad.

113
00:07:01,161 --> 00:07:03,580
They're the friends I mentioned
in the letter I sent.

114
00:07:03,663 --> 00:07:05,373
[muttering] We weren't
expecting company tonight,

115
00:07:05,457 --> 00:07:06,916
but since you came
all this way...

116
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,917
[mumbling] You and your friends

117
00:07:08,001 --> 00:07:10,003
will just have
to stay for dinner.

118
00:07:10,086 --> 00:07:12,005
[GAUCHE] Why do his
parents look the same?

119
00:07:12,088 --> 00:07:15,258
They aren't related.
Or they shouldn't be.

120
00:07:15,342 --> 00:07:17,135
Gordon. Your mother's cooking

121
00:07:17,218 --> 00:07:19,554
must taste exquisite
after all this time.

122
00:07:19,637 --> 00:07:23,016
The creepy-crawly snake eyes
are especially scrumptious.

123
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:24,642
Thanks, dear.

124
00:07:24,726 --> 00:07:26,895
I recommend the paralyzed frog.

125
00:07:26,978 --> 00:07:29,481
I want bread.
Anyone seen the bread?

126
00:07:29,564 --> 00:07:30,523
[muttering] Look down, Grandma;

127
00:07:30,607 --> 00:07:32,484
there's a whole
loaf in your hands.

128
00:07:32,567 --> 00:07:33,818
Oh. So there is.

129
00:07:33,902 --> 00:07:35,862
How'd it get off of the plate?

130
00:07:37,113 --> 00:07:38,656
Say, where did the bread go?

131
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:41,159
It's in your mouth, Grandma.

132
00:07:41,242 --> 00:07:43,453
There's something that
I wanted to ask you, Father.

133
00:07:43,536 --> 00:07:45,080
[NATHAN]
You must be hungry for seconds.

134
00:07:45,163 --> 00:07:46,831
No, it's something else.

135
00:07:46,915 --> 00:07:49,292
[GREY] Everywhere I turn, it's
nothing but weird muttering.

136
00:07:49,376 --> 00:07:52,128
I have no idea what
anyone's saying right now.

137
00:07:52,212 --> 00:07:54,631
[GAUCHE]
The hell's going on here?

138
00:07:54,714 --> 00:07:58,551
It's not easy to make me feel
awkward, but they found a way.

139
00:07:58,635 --> 00:08:00,804
Hey, say something. Come on.

140
00:08:00,887 --> 00:08:02,931
Ask them about forbidden curses.

141
00:08:03,014 --> 00:08:05,475
[GREY]
Oh, I-I couldn't possibly.

142
00:08:05,558 --> 00:08:07,394
Gordon's just shaking
while he stares at us.

143
00:08:07,477 --> 00:08:08,770
Tell him to do it.

144
00:08:08,853 --> 00:08:10,605
[grunting]

145
00:08:10,689 --> 00:08:12,607
No. That's Gordon's grandmother.

146
00:08:12,691 --> 00:08:14,150
Whoa, it wasn't
easy to get over

147
00:08:14,234 --> 00:08:18,321
how gross this stuff looks,
but it's actually super tasty!

148
00:08:18,405 --> 00:08:20,365
This is amazing!

149
00:08:20,448 --> 00:08:21,408
[GAUCHE]
Of course.

150
00:08:21,491 --> 00:08:23,868
Why wouldn't Asta be having fun?

151
00:08:25,078 --> 00:08:27,205
Ah! Uh. Hello?

152
00:08:27,288 --> 00:08:29,040
[mumbling] Please take this
as a token of my hope

153
00:08:29,124 --> 00:08:30,291
that we'll become friends.

154
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:31,459
It's kinda hard to hear you,

155
00:08:31,543 --> 00:08:33,795
but I guess you wanna
give me something?

156
00:08:36,047 --> 00:08:37,716
[laughs]

157
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:40,677
[GREY screams]
What is this?!

158
00:08:42,512 --> 00:08:45,181
[muttering] Oh, goodness,
is that actually you, Nathan?

159
00:08:45,265 --> 00:08:47,350
My, just look at how
much you've grown.

160
00:08:47,434 --> 00:08:51,021
You will protect the House of
Agrippa, won't you, my dear boy?

161
00:08:51,104 --> 00:08:53,106
[GAUCHE]
This lady's lost it.

162
00:08:53,189 --> 00:08:54,649
[JONNA]
There, there, Mother.

163
00:08:54,733 --> 00:08:57,652
I think it's time we took
you to bed, all right?

164
00:08:57,736 --> 00:09:01,239
[NILENIA] Yes, but tell
Nathan I'm counting on him.

165
00:09:01,322 --> 00:09:04,451
For the sake of our ancestor
who made the contract,

166
00:09:04,534 --> 00:09:07,328
the curse of Megicula must be--

167
00:09:07,412 --> 00:09:08,538
[JONNA]
Right. Don't fret.

168
00:09:08,621 --> 00:09:10,373
[ASTA]
Curse o' what?

169
00:09:10,457 --> 00:09:12,417
[ALL gasp]

170
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,085
[ROXANNE]
Nice to meet you.

171
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:19,090
[NUNNALLY barks]

172
00:09:19,174 --> 00:09:22,719
[GREY] Huh. It suddenly
got really quiet.

173
00:09:22,802 --> 00:09:24,721
[laughs]

174
00:09:24,804 --> 00:09:25,972
[GAUCHE]
Okay.

175
00:09:26,056 --> 00:09:27,640
[ASTA]
Make your move, Gordon.

176
00:09:27,724 --> 00:09:30,018
This is the perfect
chance to ask him!

177
00:09:37,192 --> 00:09:39,736
Father? I need to talk to you.

178
00:09:42,489 --> 00:09:45,283
I realize I basically
abandoned my family,

179
00:09:45,367 --> 00:09:48,578
so I don't have much
right to ask. But still.

180
00:09:48,661 --> 00:09:52,082
I have to ask, because I wanna
help my friend, no matter what.

181
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:57,545
It's about forbidden curses
and the devils behind them.

182
00:09:57,629 --> 00:10:00,215
Can you tell us whatever
you know about them?

183
00:10:06,096 --> 00:10:07,555
[NATHAN]
Sure.

184
00:10:08,973 --> 00:10:10,892
[GREY, GAUCHE, ASTA, GORDON]
That was easy.

185
00:10:18,274 --> 00:10:20,777
[mumbling] The Agrippa family
has practiced Curse Magic

186
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,947
and studied its enigmatic
secrets for centuries.

187
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,657
I'll show you the result.

188
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,909
In addition, I'll show
you the secret arts

189
00:10:27,992 --> 00:10:31,371
that deal with poison,
plague, and death.

190
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:35,291
Are you and your
friends prepared?

191
00:10:40,547 --> 00:10:43,091
[screams]

192
00:10:47,012 --> 00:10:49,556
No way. The hell?

193
00:10:51,433 --> 00:10:53,852
[laughs] Beautiful,
don't you agree?

194
00:10:53,935 --> 00:10:56,855
This is the workshop where
I conduct all my research.

195
00:10:56,938 --> 00:11:00,608
Along with curses, I study
every form of pain there is.

196
00:11:00,692 --> 00:11:02,318
I knew that Curse
Magic was sinister,

197
00:11:02,402 --> 00:11:04,738
but this is even worse
than I imagined.

198
00:11:04,821 --> 00:11:06,072
My dear boy.

199
00:11:06,156 --> 00:11:07,866
Rather than despair
that you were gone,

200
00:11:07,949 --> 00:11:10,744
I've eagerly awaited
your inevitable return.

201
00:11:10,827 --> 00:11:14,164
Thanks to your Poison Magic,
you are the perfect candidate

202
00:11:14,247 --> 00:11:17,250
to inherit and
advance my research.

203
00:11:17,334 --> 00:11:19,044
Sorry, Father,
but I only came here

204
00:11:19,127 --> 00:11:22,255
to ask about devil-related
curses for Asta.

205
00:11:22,339 --> 00:11:24,507
I have no intention of staying.

206
00:11:26,009 --> 00:11:27,594
Don't be like that.

207
00:11:27,677 --> 00:11:30,764
Death can be caused by poisons,
plagues, and curses.

208
00:11:30,847 --> 00:11:32,307
If you stay, I can
teach you about

209
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,642
every cause of death there is.

210
00:11:34,726 --> 00:11:37,145
[gasps] What is a
life worth to you?

211
00:11:37,228 --> 00:11:39,773
Human life is both
fragile and brief.

212
00:11:39,856 --> 00:11:44,527
Don't you understand me, son?
Perhaps I should demonstrate.

213
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:57,082
Black Oil Creation Magic:
Curse-Filled Nails.

214
00:11:57,165 --> 00:11:58,416
Stay back!

215
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,674
[ASTA screams]

216
00:12:05,757 --> 00:12:07,217
[ALL]
Asta!

217
00:12:11,012 --> 00:12:13,098
Why do I feel fine?

218
00:12:15,392 --> 00:12:16,434
Huh.

219
00:12:16,518 --> 00:12:18,436
Your temperature's
in a normal range.

220
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,854
You seem healthy.

221
00:12:19,938 --> 00:12:22,941
I'm not detecting a single
physical abnormality,

222
00:12:23,024 --> 00:12:25,944
though it strikes me as odd
that you have no magic.

223
00:12:26,027 --> 00:12:28,196
Wait a minute.
What are you doing?

224
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:31,074
[laughs] I'm working.

225
00:12:31,157 --> 00:12:33,410
I took the family's vast
knowledge of curses,

226
00:12:33,493 --> 00:12:35,995
combined it with my own
research on germs and poisons,

227
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:37,622
and applied that
knowledge to the subjects

228
00:12:37,706 --> 00:12:40,000
of health management
and medical treatment.

229
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:41,334
That said, I am the first

230
00:12:41,418 --> 00:12:44,004
to take the family business
in this new direction,

231
00:12:44,087 --> 00:12:47,048
so I can only treat
normal ailments right now.

232
00:12:47,132 --> 00:12:48,633
Hence why I had no help to offer

233
00:12:48,717 --> 00:12:50,593
when I heard that your
limbs had been afflicted

234
00:12:50,677 --> 00:12:52,762
with an ancient curse.

235
00:12:52,846 --> 00:12:54,889
Say, is something the matter?

236
00:12:54,973 --> 00:12:57,225
No, but, if you've been
using what you know

237
00:12:57,308 --> 00:12:59,352
about poison and death
and horrible curses

238
00:12:59,436 --> 00:13:01,479
to make medicine
and stuff like that,

239
00:13:01,563 --> 00:13:04,149
then the Agrippa family
business isn't hurting people;

240
00:13:04,232 --> 00:13:05,775
it's helping them get better.

241
00:13:05,859 --> 00:13:06,818
That's right.

242
00:13:06,901 --> 00:13:09,529
Has been ever since I took over.

243
00:13:09,612 --> 00:13:11,656
I honestly had no idea.

244
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,783
All this time, I thought
you were cursing people

245
00:13:13,867 --> 00:13:15,410
to die in agony.

246
00:13:15,493 --> 00:13:17,662
You people need to
learn to communicate!

247
00:13:17,746 --> 00:13:20,373
And you need to get rid
of all this creepy stuff!

248
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:22,417
This just goes to show,

249
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,544
you can't judge
a book by its cover!

250
00:13:24,627 --> 00:13:26,129
So, Father, does this mean

251
00:13:26,212 --> 00:13:28,548
that you really will
help me save my friend?

252
00:13:28,631 --> 00:13:30,091
Why, of course I will.

253
00:13:30,175 --> 00:13:32,260
But the subject of devils
and forbidden magic

254
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:34,220
is both varied and elusive,

255
00:13:34,304 --> 00:13:37,807
so let's start by discussing
your specific situation.

256
00:13:37,891 --> 00:13:39,184
Right!

257
00:13:53,615 --> 00:13:56,034
[DOROTHY] Okay. There's
still work to be done,

258
00:13:56,117 --> 00:13:58,870
but I've sent the largest chunks
of debris into my dreams.

259
00:13:58,953 --> 00:14:00,288
[CITIZENS cheer]

260
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:02,207
She did it so quickly!

261
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:04,709
That's the captain of the
Coral Peacocks for ya!

262
00:14:04,793 --> 00:14:07,379
Thank you, Captain Dorothy.
You're an inspiration!

263
00:14:07,462 --> 00:14:09,714
[NOELLE]
I'm glad you're still awake.

264
00:14:12,342 --> 00:14:13,885
Well, look at you.

265
00:14:13,968 --> 00:14:17,389
If it isn't the youngest member
of the venerable House of Silva.

266
00:14:17,472 --> 00:14:18,723
What can I help you with?

267
00:14:18,807 --> 00:14:21,101
I hear that you can
tell me the truth.

268
00:14:21,184 --> 00:14:24,062
Apparently it wasn't my
birth that killed my mother.

269
00:14:24,145 --> 00:14:27,440
I came here to ask
you about what did.

270
00:14:27,524 --> 00:14:30,026
I guess you must've
had a chat with Nozel.

271
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,528
Yeah.

272
00:14:31,611 --> 00:14:35,281
We talked when we went to see
Solid and Nebra yesterday.

273
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,576
[NOELLE sighs]
Nozel.

274
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,578
Why would you say
something like that?

275
00:14:40,662 --> 00:14:42,789
Of course our mother died
while giving birth to me;

276
00:14:42,872 --> 00:14:45,250
everyone in our family knows it.

277
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,711
Everyone believing something
doesn't make it true.

278
00:14:47,794 --> 00:14:49,671
The fact is, her
death was inevitable,

279
00:14:49,754 --> 00:14:52,132
and it had nothing
to do with your birth.

280
00:14:52,215 --> 00:14:53,925
[gasps]

281
00:14:54,009 --> 00:14:56,469
[NOZEL] It wasn't injury
or illness either.

282
00:14:56,553 --> 00:14:58,680
Lives shouldn't end
the way hers did.

283
00:14:58,763 --> 00:15:00,056
Not in this world.

284
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,642
[NOELLE gasps] Then she
was killed by something

285
00:15:02,726 --> 00:15:04,310
from a different world?

286
00:15:04,394 --> 00:15:06,855
If what you're saying is true,
this could be related

287
00:15:06,938 --> 00:15:08,148
to our investigation on devils--

288
00:15:08,231 --> 00:15:10,567
I'll advise you
to stop right there.

289
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:13,361
Keep talking, and your life
will be in danger, too.

290
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:14,863
[gasps]

291
00:15:14,946 --> 00:15:17,073
[NOZEL] If you still have
the courage to face the truth

292
00:15:17,157 --> 00:15:19,993
despite being aware of the risk
it entails, then your next move

293
00:15:20,076 --> 00:15:22,162
should be to seek out
Captain Dorothy Unsworth

294
00:15:22,245 --> 00:15:25,498
of the Coral Peacocks
and ask her what she knows.

295
00:15:27,751 --> 00:15:28,835
Please answer.

296
00:15:28,918 --> 00:15:30,503
What was it that took
my mother from me

297
00:15:30,587 --> 00:15:32,756
before I even got
a chance to know her?

298
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:33,965
I'll tell you.

299
00:15:34,049 --> 00:15:37,052
I could never say no
to a cute girl in need.

300
00:15:37,135 --> 00:15:38,636
[NOELLE]
Okay.

301
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,638
[DOROTHY] I'll leave the rest of
the cleanup to you guys, 'kay?

302
00:15:40,722 --> 00:15:42,766
[MAGIC KNIGHTS]
Yes, Ma'am! Just leave it to us!

303
00:15:42,849 --> 00:15:44,351
Not that there's
much left to do.

304
00:15:44,434 --> 00:15:46,895
Yeah, the captain's amazing
when she's awake.

305
00:15:46,978 --> 00:15:49,230
Listen. I don't know if
you're aware of this or not,

306
00:15:49,314 --> 00:15:51,316
but if my mother's death
involved a devil--

307
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:55,111
[DOROTHY] Shh. Didn't Nozel
tell you to watch what you say?

308
00:15:55,195 --> 00:15:58,573
It's dangerous. You can't
just speak of it carelessly.

309
00:15:58,656 --> 00:16:00,784
Say too much, and
you'll be cursed.

310
00:16:03,328 --> 00:16:05,914
That's the case in
this world, at least.

311
00:16:09,542 --> 00:16:10,877
Huh?

312
00:16:12,253 --> 00:16:16,716
[NOELLE screams]

313
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,760
Where am I?

314
00:16:18,843 --> 00:16:20,178
[DOROTHY]
Welcome!

315
00:16:20,261 --> 00:16:23,056
To my very own Dream Magic:
Glamour World!

316
00:16:23,139 --> 00:16:24,808
You might've guessed
this from the name,

317
00:16:24,891 --> 00:16:27,185
but it's a dream world,
completely isolated

318
00:16:27,268 --> 00:16:30,397
from the normal world and
under my total control.

319
00:16:32,107 --> 00:16:34,067
[DOROTHY]
Here! Have some tea!

320
00:16:39,239 --> 00:16:41,157
Usually, I trap
bad people in here

321
00:16:41,241 --> 00:16:43,451
for a smidge of light torture.

322
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:46,287
But also, on days like today,
I'll bring in rubble

323
00:16:46,371 --> 00:16:48,164
from damaged buildings
and unfortunates

324
00:16:48,248 --> 00:16:49,499
who've been injured.

325
00:16:49,582 --> 00:16:51,209
[NOELLE] She was right
to call it glamour "world."

326
00:16:51,292 --> 00:16:53,044
This place is enormous.

327
00:16:53,128 --> 00:16:58,133
Is everything here really
under her control? Crazy.

328
00:16:58,216 --> 00:16:58,967
Good tea.

329
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:00,343
[ASTA]
Noelle!

330
00:17:01,344 --> 00:17:02,470
Hey.

331
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:05,265
Asta? Wait a minute,
how'd you end up here?

332
00:17:05,348 --> 00:17:07,350
Eh, who cares about that?

333
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:11,521
What matters to me is
that you're lookin' good.

334
00:17:11,604 --> 00:17:13,440
I beg your pardon?

335
00:17:13,523 --> 00:17:16,526
Seriously, I could stare at
that cute face all day long!

336
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:18,403
This can't be real.
There's no way!

337
00:17:18,486 --> 00:17:19,612
Correct.

338
00:17:19,696 --> 00:17:21,072
The boy in front of you
is just an illusion

339
00:17:21,156 --> 00:17:22,782
I created from
your thoughts.

340
00:17:22,866 --> 00:17:26,453
Yeah! You think about me
all the time, Noelle!

341
00:17:26,536 --> 00:17:30,081
Huh?! That's a lie, and
I'll kill anyone who argues!

342
00:17:30,165 --> 00:17:33,084
[screams]

343
00:17:33,168 --> 00:17:34,419
Why so violent?

344
00:17:34,502 --> 00:17:37,380
You came here partially
for his sake, didn't you?

345
00:17:37,464 --> 00:17:39,966
What? No way! That twerp's
a total non-factor!

346
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:41,384
I'm sure.

347
00:17:41,468 --> 00:17:42,886
But just so you know,

348
00:17:42,969 --> 00:17:45,722
this is the perfect place
to have secret conversations.

349
00:17:45,805 --> 00:17:48,933
Wait a second.
Are you saying...?

350
00:17:49,017 --> 00:17:51,770
[NOZEL] We can discuss
Mother safely here.

351
00:17:51,853 --> 00:17:54,564
[NOELLE]
You made a fake Nozel, too?

352
00:17:54,647 --> 00:17:56,107
The real Nozel is probably off

353
00:17:56,191 --> 00:17:59,486
with his squad or something,
what do I care?

354
00:17:59,569 --> 00:18:01,237
But I'm correct in
assuming it was him

355
00:18:01,321 --> 00:18:03,740
who told you I had
the answers, right?

356
00:18:03,823 --> 00:18:05,992
About the juicy little
secret that he's kept

357
00:18:06,076 --> 00:18:07,494
from all of his siblings?

358
00:18:07,577 --> 00:18:10,205
The truth is exactly
what you suspected.

359
00:18:10,288 --> 00:18:13,208
Acier Silva lost her life
to a devil's curse.

360
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:16,211
[NOELLE]
So, why didn't Nozel say?

361
00:18:16,294 --> 00:18:19,130
Why'd he let me think that
her death was my fault?

362
00:18:19,214 --> 00:18:21,383
Because anyone who
speaks of Acier's fate

363
00:18:21,466 --> 00:18:23,385
will share it with her.

364
00:18:23,468 --> 00:18:26,221
That's the cruel nature of the
curse that befell your mother,

365
00:18:26,304 --> 00:18:29,599
and within the real world,
there's no way around it.

366
00:18:29,683 --> 00:18:32,143
But my dreamscape is a
unique plane of existence,

367
00:18:32,227 --> 00:18:34,270
so you don't have to
worry about that here.

368
00:18:34,354 --> 00:18:35,939
You can discuss the
curse all you want

369
00:18:36,022 --> 00:18:37,899
without bringing it into effect.

370
00:18:37,982 --> 00:18:40,443
You can finally
speak your minds.

371
00:18:40,527 --> 00:18:45,365
I'm sorry that it took me
so long to tell you, Noelle.

372
00:18:45,448 --> 00:18:48,535
I was afraid of putting you
in danger, so I held back.

373
00:18:49,994 --> 00:18:51,454
Aw. You're so cute.

374
00:18:51,538 --> 00:18:52,956
What'd you just say?

375
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,625
Noelle. Noelle. My sweet Noelle!

376
00:18:55,709 --> 00:18:58,253
You're the cutest little
sister in the world.

377
00:18:58,336 --> 00:19:00,463
And your big brother loves
you more than anything!

378
00:19:00,547 --> 00:19:03,383
I love you so much, I don't
know what to do with myself.

379
00:19:03,466 --> 00:19:08,138
--[NOELLE screams]
--Noelle. Noelle. Noelle!

380
00:19:08,221 --> 00:19:10,557
[gasps] I'm sorry, Nozel.

381
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,435
Hey, Dorothy, quit making
my fake brother act weird!

382
00:19:13,518 --> 00:19:15,395
Aw. Sorry about that,

383
00:19:15,478 --> 00:19:18,106
but from my perspective,
that's just the way he is.

384
00:19:21,943 --> 00:19:24,696
[NOZEL]
Why did I feel a sudden chill?

385
00:19:24,779 --> 00:19:26,322
Well, seeing as you've
just sent your brother

386
00:19:26,406 --> 00:19:30,994
flying off into the void,
I'll tell you the rest.

387
00:19:31,077 --> 00:19:34,330
The devils of the other world
can't manifest in ours,

388
00:19:34,414 --> 00:19:37,375
unless there's been some
kind of anomaly, that is.

389
00:19:37,459 --> 00:19:40,795
Mages can use forbidden magic
to form contracts with devils,

390
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:43,798
paying some price to use
their powers in a limited way,

391
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:45,091
but that's it.

392
00:19:45,175 --> 00:19:47,052
Or rather, that <i>ought</i> to be it.

393
00:19:47,135 --> 00:19:48,845
But as we speak,
a devil's shadow

394
00:19:48,928 --> 00:19:51,389
is slinking about in our world.

395
00:19:53,558 --> 00:19:56,227
The shadow's owner
is called Megicula.

396
00:19:56,311 --> 00:19:58,646
[NOELLE] Megicula.
That's the name of the devil

397
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:03,568
who killed my mother,
and the key to saving Asta!

398
00:20:03,651 --> 00:20:05,945
[NATHAN] I'm sorry to
keep you all waiting.

399
00:20:06,029 --> 00:20:08,031
After hearing about
your situation yesterday,

400
00:20:08,114 --> 00:20:11,368
I did some digging.
I understand what you need,

401
00:20:11,451 --> 00:20:14,746
and I think I have just
the spell to help you.

402
00:20:14,829 --> 00:20:18,083
This should be fairly simple.
My ancestors collected curses,

403
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:21,711
so their magic is basically
designed to find them.

404
00:20:21,795 --> 00:20:26,549
Black Oil Creation Magic:
Curse Candle Ritual Disk.

405
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:32,555
[gasps]

406
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:34,391
[GREY]
Whoa, it's a map.

407
00:20:34,474 --> 00:20:36,351
[GAUCHE]
Of the whole Clover Kingdom.

408
00:20:36,434 --> 00:20:37,977
So cool!

409
00:20:38,061 --> 00:20:39,729
[NATHAN]
Each flame marks a curse,

410
00:20:39,813 --> 00:20:42,857
with the flame's size indicating
the curse's strength.

411
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:46,027
This is a map of the sickness
eroding our kingdom.

412
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:49,072
Look at that one;
it's enormous. So fierce.

413
00:20:49,155 --> 00:20:51,908
Wait. Isn't that flame
at the Black Bull's hideout?

414
00:20:51,991 --> 00:20:53,410
It is.

415
00:20:53,493 --> 00:20:56,162
So does that mean one of the
Black Bulls has been cursed?

416
00:20:56,246 --> 00:20:58,873
Is there anybody in our squad
who seems a little off?

417
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:00,750
Uh. Let's see. Well...

418
00:21:00,834 --> 00:21:03,211
Luck is almost supernaturally
obsessed with fighting,

419
00:21:03,294 --> 00:21:05,547
but Finral's just about
equally obsessed with girls,

420
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:07,716
and if ya told me that
Vanessa's drinking was a curse,

421
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:10,135
I don't think I'd argue.

422
00:21:10,218 --> 00:21:13,179
The captain takes a long
time in the bathroom.

423
00:21:13,263 --> 00:21:14,639
So basically...

424
00:21:14,723 --> 00:21:16,349
[GORDON, GAUCHE, GREY]
They're all kinda cursed.

425
00:21:16,433 --> 00:21:18,143
Hang on a second,
what sorta evil curse

426
00:21:18,226 --> 00:21:20,270
makes ya take longer
to use the bathroom?

427
00:21:20,353 --> 00:21:21,980
And before ya go judgin'
the rest of the bulls,

428
00:21:22,063 --> 00:21:23,148
look at yourselves!

429
00:21:23,231 --> 00:21:26,026
You're all unique in
your own weird way!

430
00:21:26,109 --> 00:21:30,071
Hey. Don't call me unique;
it's embarrassing.

431
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:31,197
[screams]

432
00:21:31,281 --> 00:21:32,824
I feel like I'm normal.

433
00:21:32,907 --> 00:21:34,242
Forget us.

434
00:21:34,325 --> 00:21:36,828
You're the biggest weirdo here,
ya magic-less meathead!

435
00:21:36,911 --> 00:21:39,956
[ASTA screams]

436
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,167
Oh. Hey, speakin' of magic...

437
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:45,670
Maybe Henry's the reason
there's a fire on our base.

438
00:21:45,754 --> 00:21:46,629
[GAUCHE]
Could be.

439
00:21:46,713 --> 00:21:48,006
That would explain his condition

440
00:21:48,089 --> 00:21:50,800
that sucks away
everyone else's mana.

441
00:21:50,884 --> 00:21:52,177
[GORDON]
Oh, yeah, he's cursed.

442
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,054
[GREY]
Very cursed.

443
00:21:54,137 --> 00:21:57,307
There's a roaring flame
in the royal capital, as well.

444
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:59,642
This map can't
tell us who's cursed,

445
00:21:59,726 --> 00:22:02,354
but it does show us the
scale of the problem.

446
00:22:02,437 --> 00:22:05,148
I see quite a few small flames.

447
00:22:05,231 --> 00:22:07,317
Is there a way for us
to see a bigger area?

448
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,779
It will be less accurate
at a distance, but yes.

449
00:22:13,448 --> 00:22:14,366
Look there.

450
00:22:14,449 --> 00:22:16,368
That's in the Heart Kingdom.

451
00:22:16,451 --> 00:22:19,204
It's a lot bigger than
the one coming from our base.

452
00:22:20,789 --> 00:22:22,582
[ASTA]
Huh. Maybe there's a clue

453
00:22:22,665 --> 00:22:24,542
about the devils there.

454
00:23:56,634 --> 00:23:57,969
[GORDON]
You're my dad, Nathan.

455
00:23:58,053 --> 00:24:00,138
And you showed us where
to look for the devils!

456
00:24:00,221 --> 00:24:02,057
Thanks Dad-Who's-Also-Nathan!

457
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,642
You made my friends
really happy!
