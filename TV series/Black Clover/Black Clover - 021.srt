Threatened by a ruthless demon,

humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:24,750
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,250
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:39,541
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

consider kicking me out?

Ya know?

11
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:07,791
I have more magic power
than any royalty,

12
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:10,583
and they just tossed
me aside like garbage.

13
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:12,208
Doesn't make sense.

14
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:15,500
Magic is supposed to
be everything. Right?

Mock me. How dare they?

00:01:24,708 --> 00:01:27,750
Do you have an audience
for your incessant rambling?

[RADES]
Eh? Just talkin' to myself.

Everything is in place now.

All right.

Just wait, knights of

That's enough out

We will not be spoken to

Now you better listen up,

I'm gonna get results

I'll do whatever it takes

[gasps] No, sir.

[ALECDORA] Such behavior
cannot go unpunished.

Presumptuous fellows like this

Enough, Solid.

You shouldn't be so
quick to use your magic

So this is the Captain
of the Silver Eagles.

A commoner who dares
to defy royalty.

Now, what was your name, again?

[whispering] No, Leopold.

It's not like there's
a rule somewhere that says

144
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,250
you can only have one rival.

Okay. Sorry, Char!

of acceptance.

There are civilians. Careful.

Oh, yeah. Sorry
about that, Char.

[YUNO] Whatever these creatures
are, half-hearted attacks

00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,916
will have little effect
on them. In which case...

Let's work up an

[KLAUS] Don't think you'll
get away with this.

We will annihilate you.

What... are they?

345
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:27,625
Some strange army?

I've never seen
anything like them.

Tell me, little girl.

Do you like it here
in the Clover Kingdom?

351

Yes, I do. I love it.

So please, sir.

Please! You need to stop!

I can't! I hate
the Clover Kingdom!

00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:15,750
[gasps] What are you,
some kind of animal?

365
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:17,125
An animal?

366

Woof! Woof!

Oh, yes! A dog!
That would be adorable.

would be nice, too.

Meow, meow!

That might be even better! Wait.

371
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,041
Maybe something a little more
wild and fierce, like a wolf!

372
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:38,458
All men are wolves
sometimes, baby.

No, it's impossible.
