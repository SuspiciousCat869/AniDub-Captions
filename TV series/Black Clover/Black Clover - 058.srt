1
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:15,625
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:18,625
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:24,333
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:27,083
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,583
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:39,708
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:44,291
[NARRATOR] Asta lost the use
of his arms after Vetto

8
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:46,500
cast an ancient hex on him.

9
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:48,458
His only hope of lifting
the curse lies with

10
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:52,000
the Queen of the Forest
of Witches. But...

11
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:54,958
The Queen is more deadly
than you can imagine.

12
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:56,666
So much so that
the Diamond Kingdom

13
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,083
won't even try to
stand against her.

14
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:02,041
And there's no hope of
reasoning with her, either.

15
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:03,416
[NOELLE]
We're going.

16
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,958
Whatever it takes for us
to heal Asta's arms.

17
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:08,958
[NARRATOR]
Meanwhile, Vanessa, who hails

18
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:11,541
from said Forest, had also
returned there in hopes

19
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:14,041
of bargaining for
Asta's healing.

20
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:14,916
[DOMINANTE]
Over there!

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,833
[FINRAL, ASTA, FANZELL yelling]

22
00:01:16,916 --> 00:01:18,791
[NARRATOR] But when Asta
and his friends finally

23
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:21,250
reached the Queen's palace...

24
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:23,375
Take your foot off of her!

25
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:26,666
She's one of us!
So leave her alone!

26
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,125
Pitiful fools.

27
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:30,666
What could such imperfect
creatures possibly

28
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,291
hope to do for her?

29
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:34,666
[gasps]

30
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:39,333
I didn't expect it
to happen so soon.

31
00:01:39,416 --> 00:01:42,416
The Eye of the Midnight Sun.

32
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:17,416
The Midnight Sun?

33
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,250
Why would they come here?

34
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,291
You're not just making up
stories to trick us

35
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:22,916
into not attacking you, right?

36
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,500
[QUEEN OF WITCHES]
Imperfect.

37
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:25,666
What?

38
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,583
[QUEEN OF WITCHES]
If I were so inclined,

39
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,625
I could obliterate
every last one of you

40
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,916
with naught but
a snap of my fingers.

41
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,583
Why would I bother
deceiving you?

42
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:42,458
[BOTH gasp]

43
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:45,000
[ASTA]
It's her! From Nean!

44
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:46,625
The Third Eye is bad news.

45
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:48,458
That big hairy guy
that messed up my arms

46
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:50,083
was one of them, too!

47
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:56,500
Then it's safe to say she's
just as strong as he was.

48
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,333
She might even be stronger.

49
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:00,125
[FINRAL]
This is not good!

50
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:03,500
I'm always getting
caught up in these things!

51
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:04,916
Let them come.

52
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,916
My superior power
will vanquish those

53
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,416
imperfect fools with
perfect grace.

54
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,500
Go, tell my children!

55
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:24,666
A witch who absconded with
one of the magic stones

56
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,625
is somewhere within
those woods as we speak.

57
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,916
And those vicious humans
who took Vetto's life

58
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,333
are in there, as well.

59
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:32,750
That's true!

60
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,416
They must have been
alerted to the presence

61
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,625
of the magic stone.

62
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:38,291
They will pay!

63
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:41,416
I'll destroy everything
and secure the magic stone.

64
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,666
[CIDANE laughs]
Excellent.

65
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,791
I'm sure Master Licht will
be quite pleased with that.

66
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:49,250
It appears that they're
in the center of the forest

67
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,791
with the Queen of Witches.

68
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,250
Go on, Mistress.

69
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:56,208
Burn it all down so there's
nowhere left to hide!

70
00:04:56,291 --> 00:05:00,250
[FANA] Flame Spirit Magic:
Salamander's Breath.

[WITCHES screaming]

[WITCH 57B]
Fly away!

73
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:19,625
We're under attack!

74
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,458
[ASTA]
The Forest!

75
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:24,708
Whoa.

76
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:28,583
They've got some really
powerful Flame Magic!

77
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:31,750
[QUEEN OF WITCHES]
Salamander, the fire spirit.

78
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:34,750
Despite not having reached
its perfect form,

79
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:37,208
it's already quite strong.

80
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:40,083
Stronger than my
scrying predicted.

81
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:42,708
Is my ability faltering?

82
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:48,041
Slight imperfections beget
larger imperfections. No!

83
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:53,166
[ASTA]
There's more of 'em?

84
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,125
[DOMINANTE]
No, those are--!

85
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:58,250
Right, we're close to the
border of the Diamond Kingdom.

86
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:00,041
Yeah.

87
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:03,000
I see. So... It's true.

88
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:05,875
I'd thought this, too,
was not yet to be.

89
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:10,500
The Forest is being breached
by one more entity.

90
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:13,083
The Diamond Kingdom Army.

91
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:19,291
I don't believe it.
They're on their way, too?

92
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:24,541
Oh, rats!

93
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:28,291
And just when I had settled
into that aromatherapy soak.

94
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:31,791
What's the big emergency
summons for anyway?

95
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:33,375
It's the Third Eye.

96
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:34,875
They're preparing
to launch an attack

97
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:37,166
on the Forest of Witches.

98
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,541
During the confusion,
we're to enter the Forest,

99
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:43,458
and capture the Queen
without being detected.

100
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:45,375
Why bother with all
the sneaking around

101
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:48,750
when we know this is an
easy win for us either way?

102
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:51,125
Because orders are orders.

103
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:56,125
Well, we know that guy's tough.

104
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,708
He's the one we fought
back in the dungeon!

105
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:03,458
He's still alive!
That's so awesome!

106
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:05,500
That makes you happy?

107
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:08,708
[FINRAL] This is so unfair!
Why's it have to be this way?

108
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:10,416
I knew coming here
was gonna be risky,

109
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,208
but we got forced into
a major battle again!

110

Is this just normal for us now?!

111

[FANZELL]
That boy. I think it's Mars.

112
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:24,750
And the one next to
him must be Ladros!

113
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,500
[DOMINANTE]
Zell.

114
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:30,666
Okay. Let's protect the Forest!

115
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,791
I can take down the
Eye of the Midnight Sun

116
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,541
and the Diamond Army!

117
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:37,375
That might be tough
without arms.

118
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:40,500
[yelps] Right, I forgot!

119
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:43,041
Wow, Asta. That's the
whole reason we're here.

120

Did you not get it
the first time?

121
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:46,291
No, I remember now.

122
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:49,375
There's just so much going on,
it slipped my mind.

[ALL but ASTA]
Fair enough.

[ASTA]
Vanessa! You're awake!

128
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,041
You had us all worried!

Don't do that!

[VANESSA]

You're here, too?

134
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:21,791
Oh, and more familiar faces.

135
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:23,708
One of whom is shirtless.

136
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:25,083
Uh, yeah.

00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:27,208
It's his favorite thing to do.

Will you please stop
telling people that.

139

It's been so long, Vanessa.

140
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,666
We came to the Forest
of Witches to find a way

141
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,125
to get the curse lifted
from Asta's arms, too.

142
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:39,500
It's kind of funny that we all
wound up in the same place.

143
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,791
[VANESSA gasps]
That's right!

144
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:44,791
[VANESSA]
Don't you worry, Asta!

145
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,458
I'll make a deal with
the Queen, and your arms

00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,833
will be back to
normal in no time!

00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:51,750
[VANESSA]
Huh?

149
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:54,541
You'd have to trade your
freedom for it, right?

a big fat "no" from me!

Do you even hear how
selfish you sound?

This is our only
option, you idiot!

Tryin' to sneak back
to your mom's place

156
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:12,083
without tellin' us. That's
the dumbest idea ever!

And what would you have done
in that situation, rugrat?

00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:24,166
[FINRAL] You can't say that!
I'm your superior!

161
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,125
[ASTA chuckles]
Well, I don't need your help!

162
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:31,541
I've still got one last
resort to fall back on!

163
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,416
[panting]

164
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,958
Whoa, Asta, be careful!

165
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:42,000
I'm not a doctor,
but it kinda seems

166
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:43,333
like he's lost it.

167
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,125
You're right,
this can't end well.

168
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:47,416
Hey, what are you doing?

169
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,416
This is what I'm doing!

170
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:52,541
[QUEEN OF WITCHES]
That sword.

171
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:55,875
[ASTA growls]

172
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:56,916
[BOTH gasp]

173
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,708
[screams] Ow, it hurts so bad!

174
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:00,625
[NOELLE]
Asta!

175
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:02,291
What'd you do that for?

176
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:05,750
That curse is already lodged
deep inside of your body!

177
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,750
It doesn't matter how
strong you are, Asta.

178
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:10,791
Sometimes there's just
no way to escape your fate!

179
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:12,250
[panting]

180
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:15,958
Oh, so what you're sayin' is
that I'm stuck like this,

181
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:19,458
unless I let my good
friend sacrifice herself?

182
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:21,625
What kinda guy would
I have to be to go along

183
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,833
with somethin' like that?

184
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:26,208
If fate wants to take my arms,

185
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,333
then I'm gonna kick
fate in the butt!

186
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:29,708
[gasps]

187
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,416
[YAMI]
Huh?

188
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,791
You say we ended up here
because it was our "fate?"

189
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:39,208
Yeah, yeah, old Mr. Fate.

190
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,375
Man, I hate that guy.

191
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:43,500
Why would anybody obey him?

192
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:49,583
I live how I want, even if
it means kickin' fate's ass.

193
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:50,958
[VANESSA]
Of course.

194
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:53,166
That's what Captain Yami said.

195
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:57,541
[ASTA]
One more try!

196
00:10:57,625 --> 00:11:01,083
Stop it! Don't be so stubborn!

197
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:03,166
Listen, Asta!

198
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,458
Friends don't exist
to be sacrificed!

199
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:10,166
Friends help you overcome a fate
you can't defeat on your own!

200
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,625
That's why I'm here.

201
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:15,333
I never intended to just
throw my life away!

202
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:17,125
You wanna hear my plan?

203
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,500
I was going to trick
the Queen, get your

204
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:21,958
anti-magic power
back, and use it

205
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:24,125
to get the hell out of here!

206
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:26,833
I mean, what?

207
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:30,375
Oh, really? Why didn't
you say so earlier?

208
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:33,250
[FINRAL] Well, she definitely
shouldn't have said so now!

209
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:39,416
[NOELLE]
Hey. Queen of Witches.

210
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,500
If you can heal Asta,
stop standing around

211
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:45,250
and do it already.
Did you forget?

212
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:47,708
Your Forest is in danger.

213
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,541
[NOELLE]
Asta's itching to get out there

214
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52,375
and save your people.

215
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:54,833
He may be stupid,
but he's strong!

216
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:57,125
If you fix him,
he'll be a huge help.

217
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:58,541
Besides...

218
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:02,166
Wherever he goes,
we all follow him!

219
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:04,708
[NOELLE]
You're outnumbered.

220
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:08,208
You'll need every bit of
extra muscle you can get.

221
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:11,750
You're the Queen.

222
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,541
So make the smart choice.

223
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,958
Let us help you win this!

224
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:19,750
[QUEEN OF WITCHES] I do agree
the strength of my daughters

225
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:24,250
would prove imperfect
against foes like these.

226
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:25,708
Very well.

227
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:29,041
I will not only repair
the small one's arms--

228
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:31,750
they'll be more
robust than before.

229
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:34,000
Wow, really? Awesome!

230
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:37,541
You mean I'm gonna be as big
and buff as Captain Yami?

231
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:39,583
She said they would be "robust."

232
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:42,375
That doesn't necessarily
suggest you'll get bigger.

233
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:43,375
--So...
--[ASTA] Aw!

234
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:45,083
Come on, please?

235
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:47,333
There really isn't much
point in asking me.

236
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:50,375
I'm impressed, Noelle.
You've sure got a lot of guts!

237
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:51,625
I know!

238
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:53,458
I don't think I've ever
seen anybody stand up

239
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:56,041
to the Queen like you just did!

240
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,541
Well, I am royalty.

241
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:02,333
[NOELLE] Oh! My legs
are shaking like crazy!

242
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:05,416
[QUEEN OF WITCHES chuckles]
Rejoice while you can.

243
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,666
But come what may, both my
foolish daughter Vanessa

244
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,125
and the power of that
brat's anti-magic sword

245
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:14,125
will ultimately belong to me.

246
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:16,416
Now, Blood Recovery Magic:

247
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,833

[ASTA gasps]

249
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:29,125
My arms, they feel so
light! This is awesome!

250
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:34,083
[gasps] That spell was really
advanced, and quick, too!

251
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:37,333
I can see why she's the Queen.

252
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:42,250
Oh, yeah! I am back in the game!

253
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,541
See, look what I can do!

254
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,291
[ALL]
Oh, Asta!

255
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:47,458
[ASTA]
Now I don't have to rub my back

256
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,083
against walls when it itches!

257
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:51,166
Oh! And I can pick
my nose again!

258
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,041
But what I'm most excited
about is getting back

259
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,291
to strength training!

260
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:56,916
[BOTH]
Oh, Asta...

261
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,791
You never change.

262
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:00,166
This is sweet!

263
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,791
I can't tell if they're
more robust or whatever,

264
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:06,458
but they feel like they're
burstin' with power now!

265
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:09,708
Get ready! It's time to go!

Get ready! It's time to go!

00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:22,333
[NOELLE, FINRAL]
Yeah!

269
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:23,541
[NOELLE, FINRAL, VANESSA]
But...

270
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:25,500
[NOELLE]
First, we punish you!

271
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:28,458
Yeah, don't you ever
worry us like that again!

[ASTA screams]

274
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,375
[NOELLE] You think just
because your arms are fixed,

275
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:35,750
everything's supposed
to be hunky-dory?

276
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,666
Here! Take your dumb robe, too!

277
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,458
[ASTA] Okay, okay,
thanks for your help!

278
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:42,375
I'm sorry and I'll
never do it again!

279
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,916
Hey, wait. I didn't
feel anything.

280
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,041
[FINRAL]
So tough!

281
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,666
[VANESSA]
Is that Reinforcement Magic?

282
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:52,208
[ASTA]
Nope, just all-natural muscle!

283
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,000
[laughs]

284
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,875
Glad you're better, Asta.

285
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:58,500
[ASTA] Yeah, thank you guys
for helping me, too!

286
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:01,541
[QUEEN OF WITCHES]
I have fulfilled my promise.

287
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:05,625
But our pact is imperfect
until you use that strength.

288
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:07,708
Oh, yeah, you just wait and see!

289
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:10,041
Thanks for fixin' me up, ma'am!

00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:12,041
Huh.

00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:13,583
[FANZELL]
If it's all right with you,

292
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:15,958
let us take care of

Mars and Ladros...

294
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,000
Well, let's just say that
I have a bit of a history

295
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,291
with those two.

296
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:24,500
Sure thing, old man,
they're all yours.

297

Be careful.

00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:26,875
[FANZELL]
Right.

299
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:28,958
And, uh, get dressed, would ya?

300
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,000
Yeah.

301
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:31,541
[NOELLE]
Same to you!

00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:38,125
[laughs] Yes,
that's right, burn!

303
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:40,791
You can't surrender
after just one blast.

304
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:43,875
That wouldn't be any
fun for me at all!

these are the enemies

you were telling us
about earlier.
