tide her over for a while?

00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:43,208
[BOTH moaning]

162
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:45,833
[KLAUS] Hm? What's all
the moaning about?

163
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:48,708
[ASTA] Huh. Maybe their
heads are hurting?

164
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:53,208
[KLAUS] Knights Headquarters
ought to be just through here.

165
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:54,250
Guess there are some things

166
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:55,666
even you don't know,
huh, Four-Eyes?

167
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,583
Even we Four-Eyes
can't know everything.

168
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,000
[YUNO]
I guess somewhere along the line

169
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:02,041
he accepted his new nickname.

170
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:04,916
[MIMOSA] Wow, look how much
better he's treating Asta.

171
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,041
Anyway.

172
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:07,625
We don't often come
to Headquarters,

173
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,125
so it's easy to forget.

174
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:10,166
[gasps]

175
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,666
[BOTH gasp]

176
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:16,000
[KLAUS]
No, is that really...?

177
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:18,708
I never dreamed you would
greet us personally, sir.

178
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:26,250
He's flashy. Who do
you think this guy is?

179
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:27,916
You idiot!

180
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,208
This is none other than
the current Wizard King:

181
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:32,250
Sir Julius Novachrono.

182
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,833
[screams]

183
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:38,750
[YUNO]
It's actually him.

184
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,166
[ASTA]
The Wizard King!

185
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm pleased you were
able to obtain this.

186
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,875
This magic is very powerful.

187
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,416
It could easily be that
dungeon's greatest relic.

188
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,083
You can really read it, sir?

189
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:07,291
[JULIUS]
A little of it, yes.

190
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:10,916
[ASTA] The greatest
relic in there? Go, us!

191
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,666
[JULIUS]
Hm. Let's see here.

192
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,208
Ah!

193
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:16,791
[KLAUS]
Such excitement.

194
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:18,750
So the rumors of the
Wizard King being

195
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:21,625
an unparalleled magic
geek were true.

196
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:22,958
What do ya say?

197
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:25,333
Will you cast this spell
for me, pretty please?

198
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:27,250
I'd love to see it!

199
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,833
I'm sorry, sir.

200
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:30,208
I believe it somehow activated

201
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,375
once while we were
in the dungeon.

202
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:35,500
But I haven't been
able to use it again.

203
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:40,416
[sighs] Oh, I see.
Well, too bad.

204
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:44,583
[JULIUS]
Sylph, spirit of Wind,

205
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:47,541
one of the four major elements.

206
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:50,625
[JULIUS] So he's the one
she's chosen for this era.

207
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,333
[JULIUS]
I'm glad that you found this.

208
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:56,750
All I can tell you now is that
this spell will grow as you do.

209
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:59,833
I believe it will be a
tremendous help to you someday.

210
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:02,541
Make sure you take
good care of her.

211
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:03,541
Sir.

212
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:05,000
Wizard King, sir!

213
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:07,666
Some weird writing showed
up in my grimoire, too.

214
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,125
Please take a look.

215
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,375
Don't be impertinent.

216
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:13,500
[JULIUS]
Hm... This looks like...

217
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:15,291
Like what?

218
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:16,791
Something I can't read.

219
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:18,166
[ASTA groans]

220
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:22,458
Huh. I've never seen
writing like that anywhere.

221
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,375
And this comes out of it!

222
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,000
What do ya think, sir?

223
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:28,250
Ooh!

224
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:30,875
A second Anti-Magic sword?
That's excellent!

225
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:32,875
[chuckles]

226
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:34,625
Mine's workin' just fine.

227
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:37,375
Oh! The power of Anti-Magic.

228
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:40,250
May I... Do you think
I could hold it?

229
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:41,958
[ASTA]
Go for it!

230
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,125
[JULIUS]
Thank you so-- Whoa, man!

231
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:46,041
[ASTA]
Are you okay, Wizard King?

232
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,333
I'm amazed you can
swing this thing around.

233
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:49,750
[gasps]

234
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,458
[JULIUS] My magic power.
It's being sucked away.

235
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,000
Now I understand.

236
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:01,875
Thanks for letting me
take a look. Here you go.

237
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:04,125
I think you'd better
hold onto it.

238
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:05,833
You may be the only one who can.

239
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,208
It's too much for me to handle,

240
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:10,041
but you can wield it because
you have no magic power.

241
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:11,250
I don't understand.

242
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,166
How'd you know that
I don't have any magic?

243
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,291
And about what my sword can do?

244
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:18,708
Well, you know, that's
an excellent question.

245
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:21,875
Anyway, well done. You did
a marvelous job out there.

246
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:23,708
Much appreciated.

247
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:26,791
[ASTA]
U-Uh, uh, just-- Can I, can I,

248
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:29,333
can I maybe ask
you something, sir?

249
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:30,708
Sure, what is it?

250
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,958
I was just wondering.

251
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:36,333
[BOTH] How can I become
the Wizard King?

252
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:38,166
[laughs]

253
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,375
I see, so the two of you
are looking to become

254
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:42,083
the Wizard King, are you?

255
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:45,000
Not surprising, given that
you are Magic Knights.

256
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,125
You two must realize
how rude it is

257
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:49,500
to ask a question
like that so directly.

258
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:50,625
Now, listen.

259
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:52,291
The Wizard King must
be noble of heart

260
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:54,291
and have the implicit
trust of all of his peo--

261
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:55,916
No, Klaus.

262
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,333
It's about results.

263
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:05,958
[JULIUS] A noble heart alone
cannot protect anyone,

264
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:09,375
and the trust of the people
is earned, not granted.

265
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:10,833
You want to know
what you need to do

266
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:13,208
to gain the title
of Wizard King?

267
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:17,875
Get results. Prove that
you're the strongest.

268
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:19,458
Do what it takes.

269
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:24,666
Devote yourself to getting
results. That's all there is.

270
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,166
Anyone who's not capable
of that cannot hope

271
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,583
to stand at the summit.

272
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:32,750
[BOTH]
Exactly what I wanted to hear.

273
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:34,750
[JULIUS]
Not bad, William, Yami.

274
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:37,083
I like the look in
your newbies' eyes.

275
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:39,458
[laughs]

276
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:42,875
Now I hope you're ready
for something special,

277
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:44,625
because today, we've
gathered those knights

278
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,250
with an exceptional
number of stars

279
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,583
for the Distinguished
Service Ceremony.

280
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:50,166
[ASTA]
The Dis-- What now?

281
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,458
The Distinguished
Service Ceremony.

282
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:54,625
We give awards and
commendations to those

283
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,791
who have performed
extraordinarily well.

284
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:58,666
Oh...

285
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,541
[JULIUS] I would appreciate it
if you would join us for it.

286
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,458
This Distinguished Service
Ceremony sounds fancy.

287
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:15,125
I wonder what it's
gonna be like.

288
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:18,458
[NOELLE] Why us? I have
a bad feeling about this.

289
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:21,541
[KLAUS] I hadn't expected
this turn of events.

290
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,958
[JULIUS]
Here we are.

291
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,083
The question is:

292
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:32,666
can you achieve greater results
than these Knights have?

293
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:35,583
[gasps]

294
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:48,916
All right.

295
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,625
Let the Distinguished
Service Ceremony begin.

296
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,583
[NARRATOR] The Clover
Kingdom's Magic Knights

297
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:58,166
are given ranks based upon the
caliber of their performance.

298
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,833
With the Wizard King at the top,

299
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:01,833
the ranks are divided into five,

300
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:04,708
from First through Fifth Class.

301
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:07,708
Knights gain rank through
exemplary performance.

302
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:09,833
They must obtain the
required number of stars

303
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:12,333
before the annual
Distinguished Service Ceremony,

304
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:15,791
when the Wizard King will
bestow new ranks accordingly.

305
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:17,916
With a total of seven stars,

306
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,083
from the Crimson
Lion Kings squad,

307
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:22,541
Leopold Vermillion,
step forward.

308
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,333
I hereby bestow
upon you the rank

309
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:27,625
of Intermediate Magic
Knight, Second Class.

310
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:30,291
[JULIUS]
Like your brother,

311
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:32,000
captain of the
Crimson Lion Kings,

312
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:35,583
your use of Flame Magic
can be a bit overwhelming.

313
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,416
You may wanna consider
toning it down a little.

314
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,791
[JULIUS chuckles]

315
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:41,041
There's no room for mercy

316
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:43,541
when you're fighting
against evil, sir.

317
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:45,750
Next, with a total of six stars.

318
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:49,666
From the Blue Rose
Knights: Sol Marron.

319
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:50,958
I grant you the rank of

320
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:54,000
Intermediate Magic
Knight, Third Class.

321
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:56,291
Your vitality, a match
for any man's,

322
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:59,291
is amazing, as is your
unique Earth Magic.

323
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,541
But perhaps you have
a bit too much freedom.

324
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:04,416
The only person who can
tie me down is Charlotte.

325
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,166
I mean, my captain.

326
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,166
Now, with a total of six stars,

327
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,916
hailing from the Silver Eagles.
I call Solid Silva.

328
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,041
I grant you the rank of

329
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:16,500
Intermediate Magic
Knight, Third Class.

330
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:19,083
You exhibit great skill
in controlling your magic,

331
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:20,833
but it would be better
if you could work with

332
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:24,166
those around you rather than
showing off your own powers.

333
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,583
I'll keep that
in mind going forward.

334
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:30,458
With a total of nine stars,
from the Silver Eagles,

335
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:32,541
is Nebra Silva.

336
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:33,583
I grant you the rank of

337
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,208
Senior Magic Knight,
Fifth Class.

338
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:38,750
The illusions that you create
with your Mist Magic

339
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,958
are truly incredible.

340
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,041
But you have a habit
of using them to toy

341
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:45,000
with your foe
more than necessary.

342
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,666
It may backfire someday.

343
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,833
Thank you for the advice.
I'll take it to heart.

344
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,958
With a total of seven stars,

345
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:55,708
hailing from the
Golden Dawn: Hamon Caseus.

346
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,250
I hereby grant you the rank of

347
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,916
Intermediate Magic
Knight, Second Class.

348
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,250
Looking at you,
one wouldn't think

349
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:02,750
you'd wield Glass Magic.

350
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:05,333
I imagine that often
confuses your enemies.

351
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:07,625
Yes, sir, it does. Thank you.

352
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:09,833
[laughs]

353
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:12,000
Next, with a total
of eight stars,

354
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:15,833
also from the Golden
Dawn: Shiren Tium.

355
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:16,958
I grant you the rank of

356
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:19,041
Intermediate Magic
Knight, First Class.

357
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:21,208
Behind your eloquent magic
is a reticent mage

358
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,375
who rarely speaks his own mind.

359
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:25,375
I encourage you to make
your thoughts and opinions

360
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:27,458
known more often.

361
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:29,083
Sir.

362
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:31,833
And now, with a
total of 11 stars,

363
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:36,041
from the Golden Dawn:
Alecdora Sandler.

364
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:37,125
I grant you the rank of

365
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:39,625
Senior Magic Knight,
Fourth Class.

366
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,708
I commend you for both
your flexible magic

367
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:43,708
and your diligent demeanor.

368
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:47,125
However, you might consider
relaxing occasionally.

369
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:49,666
Welcome words, sir, thank you.

370
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,833
[JULIUS]
Your efforts have helped bring

371
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:53,666
the Golden Dawn's
total to 71 stars.

372
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,375
A commanding lead.

373
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:56,916
The rest of you will
have to work hard

374
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,625
not to be left behind.

375
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:01,875
Well, that concludes
the formal bit.

376
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:03,708
We've also prepared
a simple banquet

377
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:07,000
to celebrate the occasion,
so please enjoy yourselves.

378
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:08,791
And you may not have noticed,

379
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:12,166
but I invited
some special guests.

380
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,708
I hope you'll mix and
mingle with them, as well.

381
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:16,291
[JULIUS laughs]

382
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:17,666
[MARX]
Pardon, sir.

383
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,458
I'm sorry, but
something's come up.

384
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,833
You'll have to excuse me.

385
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:25,750
Have an excellent time, now!

386
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,250
[JULIUS laughs]

387
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:36,583
[gasps] Their contempt
is almost palpable.

388
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:39,083
How are we supposed
to enjoy this?

389
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:44,041
Just look at them.

390
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:45,750
Why would the
Wizard King subject us

391
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,666
to this kind of treatment?

392
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,708
The man himself couldn't even
stick around to witness it.

393
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:53,541
[SOLID, NEBRA chuckle]

394
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,041
[ASTA]
What is this?!

395
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:59,791
I've... never... had...
anything... like... this!

396
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:02,291
Though it doesn't seem
to have affected him much.

397
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:04,166
As unashamed as ever.

398
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,916
I wouldn't say unashamed,
more uncivilized.

399
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,750
Uh. Excuse me.

400
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:12,416
I was thinking... If you
don't mind, maybe I'd join you.

401
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,041
[ASTA]
Oh, sure, Mimosa!

402
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:16,708
So you've been eyeing
this meat, too, huh?

403
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:19,333
[MIMOSA] Oh, yes!
It looks very delicious.

404
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:22,041
Filthy, gluttonous commoner.

405
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:25,083
Why would the Wizard King
invite such a vulgar guest?

406
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,333
[NEBRA] I can't sense
any magic power in him.

407
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:29,250
If he did clear that dungeon,

408
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:31,208
I'm sure it was purely by luck.

409
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:33,541
What a positively
atrocious eater!

410
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:35,125
[laughs]

411
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:37,500
It's much like having
a rat in the throne room.

412
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,583
His presence here is unnatural.

413
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:43,125
[HAMON, NEBRA laugh]

414
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:45,458
You guys really don't
pull your punches, huh?

415
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,625
Oh, well, nothin'
I'm not used to.

416
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,666
[MIMOSA, KLAUS] It doesn't
even seem to bother him!

417
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,416
[LEOPOLD] If I remember
correctly, you've got

418
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,083
a commoner in your squad, too.

419
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:56,750
Everyone thinks he's a big deal

420
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:59,375
because of his four-leaf
clover grimoire.

421
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:02,166
But he's a commoner,
through and through.

422
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:06,416
They might've pulled off
the dungeon-crawling mission.

423
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,458
But I have no doubt I would
have done a better job.

424
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:14,083
Well, Crimson Lion cub,
aren't you full of yourself?

425
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:15,625
His work may be sub-par,

426
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:18,375
but it's not as if we
expect much of a commoner.

427
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,458
True, he's Golden Dawn,

428
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:22,791
but it is we nobles
who embody the ideals

429
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:25,583
of our squad and captain.

430
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,166
Now, with all due respect--

431
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,458
[ALECDORA]
And what about you, Klaus?

432
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:31,458
A man of your caliber
ought to be ashamed

433
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:33,708
to be seen in the company
of those commoners.

434
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:34,458
[KLAUS gasps]

435
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,416
As for you, Mimosa.

436
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,125
I hear you were
promptly wounded

437
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:41,791
in the dungeon and removed
yourself from the front lines.

438
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,500
Your ineptitude is making royal

439
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:45,750
House Vermillion
a laughingstock.

440
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:49,000
I... I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to.

441
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:51,416
No, she performed admirably!

442
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:54,958
Come, Alecdora.

443
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:58,416
We all know who the most
inept person here is.

444
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,666
[NOELLE gasps]

445
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:04,166
And it's not poor little
Mimosa. Right, Noelle?

446
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,458
[gasps]

447
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:11,791
Why, Solid? Why
would you do that?

448
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,583
And to your own sister!

449
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:14,958
[ASTA growls]

450
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:17,416
[SOLID] You can't even
control your magic properly.

451
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,875
Could there be any greater
disgrace than you?

452
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:21,875
You were as good as
banished from House Silva

453
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:23,958
for being an abject failure.

454
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:26,416
How dare you come waltzing
back into the Noble Realm

455
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,041
as if you belong?

456
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:30,333
Nebra, please, stop this.

457
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:34,041
[NOZEL] You let a single
success go to your head,

458
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:35,375
and now you've
come here to sully

459
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:38,625
the Silva name
with your presence.

460
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:41,666
But, we were invited.

461
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,750
This is no place for a
pathetic creature like you.

462
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:49,083
Now leave. Wasn't killing
our mother enough?

463
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,708
[ASTA growls]

464
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:57,000
[gasps]

465
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:01,500
You don't need to run away
from people like this, Noelle.

466
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:03,791
But... I...

467
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,583
[BOTH gasp]

468
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:11,291
[ASTA] You were invited here
by the Wizard King,

469
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:14,125
so I figured you had
to be pretty amazing.

470
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:16,916
But you're just like all the
rest of them, aren't you?

471
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,083
[gasps]

472
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:22,083
[ASTA] Commoner! Rat!
Disgrace! Failure!

473
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:25,833
Do you think I care if
I fit in with you people?

474
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:27,875
Watch! Because I will--

475
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:32,166
That's enough out
of you, little rat.

476
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,375
