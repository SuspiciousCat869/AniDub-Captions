00:00:23,763 --> 00:00:25,598
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:25,682 --> 00:00:28,560
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:32,105 --> 00:00:34,357
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:34,441 --> 00:00:37,027
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:43,533 --> 00:00:45,493
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:45,577 --> 00:00:49,706
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,045
[ASTA] Now we have to
defeat their leader?

8
00:00:55,128 --> 00:00:56,713
What's with the sword?

9
00:00:58,548 --> 00:01:02,802
[NARRATOR] Licht had awakened
from his centuries-long slumber,

10
00:01:02,886 --> 00:01:04,471
overwhelming Asta and Yuno

11
00:01:04,554 --> 00:01:07,015
with his devastating
strength and magic power.

12
00:01:07,098 --> 00:01:08,725
[ASTA grunts]

13
00:01:08,808 --> 00:01:11,478
[YUNO yells]

14
00:01:13,855 --> 00:01:16,858
You're not killin' Yuno!

15
00:01:16,941 --> 00:01:19,569
Or Asta, either!

16
00:01:19,652 --> 00:01:22,572
[BOTH]
He's my rival!

17
00:01:24,449 --> 00:01:25,950
[NARRATOR]
Even their perfectly coordinated

18
00:01:26,034 --> 00:01:29,913
simultaneous attack had
no effect on their foe.

19
00:01:29,996 --> 00:01:32,540
Well, 'bout that time.

20
00:01:32,624 --> 00:01:35,168
Let's go pay the rest
of our friends a visit,

21
00:01:35,251 --> 00:01:38,588
and then, we'll wipe
out all humankind!

22
00:01:40,507 --> 00:01:41,966
[NARRATOR]
After escaping from the hideout

23
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:43,635
by the skin of their teeth,

24
00:01:43,718 --> 00:01:46,221
Asta and Yuno joined forces
their friends and hurried

25
00:01:46,304 --> 00:01:49,057
toward the capital, determined
to save the Clover Kingdom

26
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,685
and return the possessed
Magic Knights to normal.

27
00:01:51,768 --> 00:01:52,894
However...

28
00:01:52,977 --> 00:01:54,104
Poison Plant Magic:

29
00:01:54,187 --> 00:01:57,273
Now, Zhovniir's Garden
of Lingering Burns.

30
00:01:59,067 --> 00:02:00,151
But, that's...

31
00:02:00,235 --> 00:02:02,070
[BOTH]
...the Village!

32
00:02:02,153 --> 00:02:04,155
[NARRATOR] The pair soon
realized that their hometown

33
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:06,741
was under attack
by elven forces.

34
00:02:06,825 --> 00:02:09,202
Stop!

35
00:02:09,285 --> 00:02:10,745
Oh, no! Stay back!

36
00:02:10,829 --> 00:02:13,415
[yells]

37
00:02:19,921 --> 00:02:21,881
[LILY]
Asta. Yuno.

38
00:02:21,965 --> 00:02:23,633
You're really brave, Nash!

39
00:02:23,717 --> 00:02:25,093
Good job!

40
00:02:25,176 --> 00:02:28,263
[BOTH]
Stay back. It's our turn now!

41
00:04:05,568 --> 00:04:08,613
[DIGIT] So, you blocked
my attack. Nicely done.

42
00:04:08,697 --> 00:04:09,864
You must be Magic Knights,

43
00:04:09,948 --> 00:04:13,368
just like the previous
owner of this body was.

44
00:04:13,451 --> 00:04:16,538
Let's see. What
will you do next?

45
00:04:16,621 --> 00:04:19,249
Poison Plant Magic:
Zofnir's Breath.

46
00:04:19,332 --> 00:04:22,002
And Zofnir's Fingers,
for good measure.

47
00:04:23,503 --> 00:04:25,714
[DIGIT] I wonder,
will you succumb to poison

48
00:04:25,797 --> 00:04:29,592
the way they did,
or will you be impaled?

49
00:04:29,676 --> 00:04:30,885
Your choice.

50
00:04:30,969 --> 00:04:32,345
[BOTH]
Not happening!

51
00:04:32,429 --> 00:04:33,847

00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:38,476
[yells]

53
00:04:40,186 --> 00:04:43,815
Look at them now!
They're strong!

54
00:04:43,898 --> 00:04:45,692
[HIGH PRIEST]
It's a miracle.

55
00:04:45,775 --> 00:04:49,112
Those two were left at the
church on the same day.

56
00:04:49,195 --> 00:04:52,157
They grew up in this village.

57
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,160
And then, the two of
them set off courageously

58
00:04:55,243 --> 00:04:57,829
into the world,
with their aspirations

59
00:04:57,912 --> 00:05:00,582
to become the Wizard King.

60
00:05:00,665 --> 00:05:03,543
They've grown into
such capable young men,

61
00:05:03,626 --> 00:05:07,339
and now they're here
to save Hage Village!

62
00:05:07,422 --> 00:05:09,841
[CHILDREN crying]

63
00:05:09,924 --> 00:05:11,926
Asta told me once.

64
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:15,221
If you don't give up,
you can achieve your dreams.

65
00:05:15,305 --> 00:05:17,474
You can make everybody happy!

66
00:05:19,934 --> 00:05:21,436
Yes.

67
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:23,980
They may have been
gone for a while,

68
00:05:24,064 --> 00:05:27,901
but we've still kept
them in our hearts.

69
00:05:27,984 --> 00:05:29,569
And we know they've
been working hard

70
00:05:29,652 --> 00:05:32,572
toward their goal of
becoming Wizard King.

71
00:05:34,032 --> 00:05:35,367
Thank you.

72
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:41,664
I knew we were right
about you, Yuno!

73
00:05:41,748 --> 00:05:43,500
The pride and joy of Hage,

74
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,418
making it into
the Magic Knights!

75
00:05:45,502 --> 00:05:46,795
Not that I'm surprised.

76
00:05:46,878 --> 00:05:48,505
Yuno can do anything!

77
00:05:48,588 --> 00:05:49,923
Yeah, anything!

78
00:05:50,006 --> 00:05:50,924
Everyone in the village

79
00:05:51,007 --> 00:05:52,384
will be so excited
when they hear.

80
00:05:52,467 --> 00:05:54,177
And what does Asta's letter say?

81
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,261
Can you even make out

82
00:05:55,345 --> 00:05:57,013
that terrible chicken
scratch of his?

83
00:05:57,097 --> 00:05:58,973
[NASH] Yeah, he writes
like a five-year-old.

84
00:05:59,057 --> 00:06:00,934
So does he say when
he's coming home?

85
00:06:01,017 --> 00:06:03,812
When he does get here,
we'll have to cheer him up.

86
00:06:03,895 --> 00:06:06,940
Even Asta will have a hard time
bouncing back from this.

87
00:06:07,023 --> 00:06:10,151
Maybe a pop-potato party
will lift his spirits.

88
00:06:10,235 --> 00:06:13,446
Actually, he says
that he got in.

--[ARLU] Huh?

91
00:06:16,908 --> 00:06:18,326
They both passed.

Mm-hm!

00:06:23,331 --> 00:06:26,418
Oh, wow. You're not
kidding, are you?

96
00:06:26,501 --> 00:06:29,004
Really! He did it. So, um.

97
00:06:29,087 --> 00:06:33,425
I guess, then, Asta won't
be coming home, will he?

98
00:06:33,508 --> 00:06:36,970
Right. We'll go let everyone
know about our Magic Knights.

99
00:06:37,053 --> 00:06:40,181
This will be the best news
Hage Village has ever gotten.

100
00:06:40,265 --> 00:06:41,516
Amazing!

101
00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:43,518
He's gonna be a Magic Knight,
just like he said.

102
00:06:43,601 --> 00:06:45,478
He did it!

103
00:06:45,562 --> 00:06:48,148
[LILY] As time went on,
the occasional letters

104
00:06:48,231 --> 00:06:50,483
from Asta and Yuno
became a special treat

105
00:06:50,567 --> 00:06:52,736
that we all looked forward to.

106
00:06:54,696 --> 00:06:56,990
[ASTA]
How's it goin', Sister Lily?

107
00:06:57,073 --> 00:06:58,616
Is there anything
new goin' on with Nash

108
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,661
and the rest of the gang lately?
My first assignment as a member

109
00:07:01,745 --> 00:07:04,164
of the Black Bulls
was to go boar-hunting.

110
00:07:04,247 --> 00:07:05,999
But we ended up running
into this mysterious

111

bad guy who was super tough!"

[gasps]

113
00:07:11,796 --> 00:07:14,549
You stand no chance of
prevailing against me.

114
00:07:14,632 --> 00:07:16,509
Why not accept that and give up?

115
00:07:16,593 --> 00:07:20,013
If I gave up now, then
who would protect them?

116
00:07:20,096 --> 00:07:21,222
[VILLAGERS gasp]

117
00:07:21,306 --> 00:07:23,099
[ASTA]
I realized something.

00:07:23,183 --> 00:07:24,434
[HEATH]
Hm?

119
00:07:24,517 --> 00:07:27,312
Sooner or later, I'm going
to be the Wizard King.

120
00:07:27,395 --> 00:07:29,773
But it's not just
about keeping a promise.

121
00:07:29,856 --> 00:07:32,817
It's about keeping people safe!

122
00:07:32,901 --> 00:07:35,278
You ready, Asta?

123
00:07:35,362 --> 00:07:36,571
Here we go.

124
00:07:36,654 --> 00:07:39,741
All the magic power
I've got left!

[MAGNA yells]

128
00:07:54,714 --> 00:07:57,967
[HEATH] This is the final
spell of your pathetic life?

129
00:07:58,051 --> 00:08:00,261
What a complete waste.

Your time is up.

[ASTA]
You wish!

00:08:11,731 --> 00:08:13,608
[HEATH]
That wasn't the real attack.

He's reflecting the spell.

134

[ASTA]
Not done yet!

135
00:08:20,907 --> 00:08:23,827
As long as I can still
move, I'm not done!

136
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,829
No. You can't...!

137
00:08:25,912 --> 00:08:27,372

[ASTA yells]

[ASTA] We managed to
win the battle somehow,

but we couldn't prevent
him from destroying himself

141
00:08:41,678 --> 00:08:43,680
in the end, and we weren't able

142
00:08:43,763 --> 00:08:46,266
to keep all the
villagers safe, either.

143
00:08:46,349 --> 00:08:48,435
I can tell it's gonna be
a long road to becoming

144
00:08:48,518 --> 00:08:50,729
the Wizard King,
but no matter how hard

145
00:08:50,812 --> 00:08:53,273
things may get,
I'll never give up!

146

[NASH] Never giving up
is the one thing he's better

147

give up on that, though.

[REKKA] Sister Lily, can
you read Yuno's letter now?

I can read that one myself,
if you don't mind!

"Greetings, everyone.

where I got to meet
the Wizard King.

162
00:09:28,683 --> 00:09:30,810
Sincerely, Yuno."

163
00:09:30,894 --> 00:09:32,937
[HORO, ARLU gasp]
So cool!

164
00:09:33,021 --> 00:09:35,273
What's the letter
say after that?

165
00:09:35,357 --> 00:09:38,068
[HIGH PRIEST] Er, it looks
like that's all of it.

166
00:09:38,151 --> 00:09:41,654
[NASH] Yuno's letters are always
so short and to the point.

167
00:09:41,738 --> 00:09:42,906
I've noticed that.

168
00:09:42,989 --> 00:09:45,784
There's a lot more
detail in Asta's writing.

169
00:09:45,867 --> 00:09:48,953
He says. "Me and Yuno
went to Headquarters

170
00:09:49,037 --> 00:09:51,456
to give a report
about our mission."

171
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,794
[KLAUS]
No, is that really...?

172
00:09:55,877 --> 00:09:58,630
I never dreamed you would
greet us personally, sir.

173
00:10:02,717 --> 00:10:05,387
He's flashy. Who do
you think this guy is?

174
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:06,763
You idiot!

175
00:10:06,846 --> 00:10:09,265
This is none other than
the current Wizard King:

176
00:10:09,349 --> 00:10:11,184
Sir Julius Novachrono.

177
00:10:11,267 --> 00:10:12,185
[yelps]

178
00:10:12,268 --> 00:10:13,770
[YUNO gasps]

179
00:10:15,522 --> 00:10:17,232
[YUNO]
It's actually him.

180
00:10:17,315 --> 00:10:18,900
[ASTA]
The Wizard King!

181
00:10:22,112 --> 00:10:23,238
[JULIUS]
Anyway, well done.

182
00:10:23,321 --> 00:10:24,948
You did a marvelous
job out there.

183
00:10:25,031 --> 00:10:26,825
Much appreciated.

184
00:10:26,908 --> 00:10:28,368
[ASTA]
Uh, er, uh-- uh--

185
00:10:28,451 --> 00:10:31,579
Jus-- Can I-- Can I-- Can I
maybe ask you something, sir?

186
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,873
Sure, what is it?

187
00:10:33,957 --> 00:10:36,126
I was just wondering...

188
00:10:36,209 --> 00:10:38,420
[BOTH] How can I become
the Wizard King?

189
00:10:39,671 --> 00:10:43,133
[laughs] I see, so the
two of you are looking

190
00:10:43,216 --> 00:10:45,385
to become the
Wizard King, are you?

191
00:10:45,468 --> 00:10:48,138
Not surprising, given that
you are Magic Knights.

192
00:10:48,221 --> 00:10:50,223
You two must realize
how rude it is

193
00:10:50,306 --> 00:10:52,517
to ask a question
like that so directly.

194
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,643
Now, listen.

195
00:10:53,727 --> 00:10:55,186
The Wizard King must
be noble of heart

196
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:57,313
and have the implicit
trust of all of his pe--

197
00:10:57,397 --> 00:10:59,357
No, Klaus.

198
00:11:02,193 --> 00:11:05,363
It's about results.

199
00:11:05,447 --> 00:11:08,074
A noble heart alone
cannot protect anyone,

200
00:11:08,158 --> 00:11:11,369
and the trust of the people
is earned, not granted.

201
00:11:11,453 --> 00:11:12,954
You want to know
what you need to do

202
00:11:13,038 --> 00:11:15,373
to gain the title
of Wizard King?

203
00:11:15,457 --> 00:11:19,210
Get results. Prove that
you're the strongest.

204
00:11:19,294 --> 00:11:20,920
Do what it takes.

205
00:11:21,004 --> 00:11:23,214
Devote yourself
to getting results.

206
00:11:23,298 --> 00:11:26,009
That's all there is.

207
00:11:26,092 --> 00:11:28,511
Anyone who is not capable
of that cannot hope

208
00:11:28,595 --> 00:11:30,597
to stand at the summit.

209
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,849
[BOTH]
Exactly what I wanted to hear.

210
00:11:35,226 --> 00:11:38,355
[ASTA] "Devote yourself
to getting results."

211
00:11:38,438 --> 00:11:40,023
The way he said it was simple,

212
00:11:40,106 --> 00:11:42,442
but his words really
stuck with me.

213
00:11:42,525 --> 00:11:44,736
I'm gonna get results
on top of results,

214
00:11:44,819 --> 00:11:47,697
as much as I can!

215
00:11:47,781 --> 00:11:48,990
[LILY]
Those two are working hard

216
00:11:49,074 --> 00:11:51,117
in a completely different world.

217
00:11:51,201 --> 00:11:53,286
A place those of us
in the Forsaken Realm

218
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:54,913
can't even imagine.

219
00:11:54,996 --> 00:11:56,456
Hearing about
their accomplishments

220
00:11:56,539 --> 00:11:59,501
always filled us with
so much courage and hope.

221
00:12:01,795 --> 00:12:03,672
[LILY]
But then...

222
00:12:03,755 --> 00:12:05,465
[ASTA]
Dear Hage Village,

223
00:12:05,548 --> 00:12:07,467
I'm about to go explore
the Underwater Temple

224
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:11,471
at the bottom of the sea!

225
00:12:11,554 --> 00:12:14,182
[LILY] We didn't know why,
but that was the last bit

226
00:12:14,265 --> 00:12:16,267
of correspondence
we received from Asta

227
00:12:16,351 --> 00:12:18,395
for quite some time.

228
00:12:26,736 --> 00:12:29,322
[LILY] We told ourselves
"no news is good news,"

229
00:12:29,406 --> 00:12:31,783
since that's what
the old adage says.

230
00:12:31,866 --> 00:12:34,411
But after Asta's letters
stopped coming in,

231
00:12:34,494 --> 00:12:36,579
we found ourselves
worrying about his safety

232
00:12:36,663 --> 00:12:38,373
more and more.

233
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,877
[LILY] When a message
did eventually arrive,

234
00:12:42,961 --> 00:12:44,879
we were shocked at what we saw.

235
00:12:44,963 --> 00:12:47,424
It was pages and
pages long, almost like

236
00:12:47,507 --> 00:12:48,675
he'd written down everything

237
00:12:48,758 --> 00:12:51,177
that had ever happened
in his life.

238
00:12:51,261 --> 00:12:52,846
[ASTA]
To everyone in the village.

239
00:12:52,929 --> 00:12:55,432
I'm sorry I haven't written
to you in a long time.

240
00:12:55,515 --> 00:12:57,600
Don't get me wrong,
I really wanted to!

241
00:12:57,684 --> 00:13:00,061
I just couldn't.

242
00:13:00,145 --> 00:13:02,731
[LILY] Asta told us the story
of a fierce battle against

243
00:13:02,814 --> 00:13:05,734
the Eye of the Midnight Sun
in the Underwater Temple,

244
00:13:05,817 --> 00:13:07,277
and explained that
both of his arms

245
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,738
had been rendered useless
by Curse Magic.

246
00:13:09,821 --> 00:13:12,323
When he received an
examination, the doctor said

247
00:13:12,407 --> 00:13:14,325
he would never write
a letter again,

248
00:13:14,409 --> 00:13:16,453
much less hold a sword.

249
00:13:16,536 --> 00:13:18,997
His fellow Black Bulls
learned about his predicament

250
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,584
and set off on a relentless
search for a cure.

251
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:24,753
Then, he wrote that he had gone

252
00:13:24,836 --> 00:13:26,963
to the Forest of Witches,
where the Queen

253
00:13:27,047 --> 00:13:29,674
cast a spell that
rid him of his curse.

254
00:13:36,848 --> 00:13:41,936
[ASTA]
My magic is never giving up!

255
00:13:44,147 --> 00:13:47,567
[LADROS] So you had this
big dramatic transformation.

256
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:51,279
Did you expect me to be
impressed by that or something?

257
00:13:58,828 --> 00:14:00,121
[LADROS]
You're mine!

258
00:14:16,805 --> 00:14:18,890
[yells]

259
00:14:24,187 --> 00:14:25,438
[LADROS groans]

260
00:14:34,447 --> 00:14:38,660
[LADROS yells]

261
00:14:54,926 --> 00:14:59,347
[LADROS]
What... are... you?

262
00:15:02,475 --> 00:15:05,437
How the hell is this happening?

263
00:15:06,688 --> 00:15:11,776
I want you out of my sight!

264
00:15:13,945 --> 00:15:15,739
[ASTA growls]

265
00:15:23,288 --> 00:15:25,498
[ASTA growling]

266
00:15:25,582 --> 00:15:27,125
It's not fair!

267
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:30,962
I stepped on so many people
to get to where I am now!

268
00:15:31,046 --> 00:15:33,256
I can't lose to you!

269
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:36,259
[ASTA] You always kicked
your friends down,

270
00:15:36,343 --> 00:15:40,847
but my friends helped
me be better. Stronger!

271
00:15:42,932 --> 00:15:45,185
[ASTA]
Black Meteorite!

272
00:15:45,268 --> 00:15:47,187
[LADROS screams]

273
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:58,656
[growls]

274
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:04,079
[LILY] Not long after that,
both Asta and Yuno wrote to us

275
00:16:04,162 --> 00:16:06,498
about their excellent showing
at the Star Festival,

276
00:16:06,581 --> 00:16:09,292
and how they'd won the approval
of those in the royal capital.

277
00:16:09,376 --> 00:16:12,379
Hearing of their success made
our hearts glow with pride!

278
00:16:12,462 --> 00:16:15,632
My, that certainly was an
exciting entrance, wasn't it?

279
00:16:15,715 --> 00:16:17,509
Let's all applaud for
the rookie who's done

280
00:16:17,592 --> 00:16:19,844
the most for the Black
Bulls this year. Asta!

281
00:16:19,928 --> 00:16:22,055
Aw, shucks, thank you, guys!

282
00:16:23,723 --> 00:16:25,517
[JULIUS] Yuno and Asta
are the top earners

283
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,227
among all of the novice Knights,

284
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:29,979
which means they're
two new stars to watch!

285
00:16:30,063 --> 00:16:32,023
They've produced
outstanding results,

286
00:16:32,107 --> 00:16:33,566
considering the fact
they've only been

287
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:34,901
Knights for half a year.

288
00:16:34,984 --> 00:16:36,778
Interestingly,
these 16-year-olds

289
00:16:36,861 --> 00:16:39,322
are childhood friends
from the same hometown.

290
00:16:39,406 --> 00:16:40,448
For being so young,

291
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:42,325
those two are doing
marvelous things!

292
00:16:42,409 --> 00:16:44,411
Yeah, they're probably nobility!

293
00:16:44,494 --> 00:16:46,830
[SEKKE] Actually, they're
naught but commoners!

294
00:16:46,913 --> 00:16:47,664
[CITIZENS gasp]

295
00:16:47,747 --> 00:16:49,124
It's true ha, ha!

296
00:16:49,207 --> 00:16:50,542
The scrawny guy
from the Black Bulls

297
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:53,086
doesn't even have any magic,
isn't that so sad?

298
00:16:53,169 --> 00:16:54,337
[CITIZEN 70Y]
Commoners?

299
00:16:54,421 --> 00:16:55,338
[CITIZEN 70Z]
Really?

300
00:16:55,422 --> 00:16:56,881
[CITIZEN 70AA]
He can't use magic?

301
00:16:56,965 --> 00:16:58,133
[CITIZEN 70II]
Makes you wonder if they really

302
00:16:58,216 --> 00:16:59,759
earned those stars.

303
00:16:59,843 --> 00:17:00,885
That's so rude!

304
00:17:00,969 --> 00:17:02,887
What is the matter
with these people?

305
00:17:02,971 --> 00:17:04,055
[YUNO]
Bell.

306
00:17:04,139 --> 00:17:05,557
What is it, Yuno?

307
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,434
Let's show them.

308
00:17:07,517 --> 00:17:10,103
Ah, ha! It'd be my pleasure.

309
00:17:10,186 --> 00:17:13,898
[CITIZENS gasping, chattering]

310
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:17,318
Ooh!

311
00:17:20,989 --> 00:17:24,242
Yuno, wait. What are
you about to do?

312
00:17:24,325 --> 00:17:26,911
Asta, remember how
we used to train

313
00:17:26,995 --> 00:17:29,330
back when we were little kids?

314
00:17:29,414 --> 00:17:30,457
Yeah, but...

315
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,052
[ASTA grunts]

316
00:17:44,846 --> 00:17:48,183
[CITIZENS yell]

317
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:55,523
Why do you always
have to pull crazy stuff

318
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:57,984
like this on me outta nowhere?

319
00:17:58,068 --> 00:18:00,445
You're stronger now!
What, are you tryin' to kill me

320
00:18:00,528 --> 00:18:03,239
during my 15 seconds
of fame, ya big jerk?

321
00:18:03,323 --> 00:18:05,867
[YUNO] If that'd killed you,
we'd know what your limit was.

322
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:07,077
Good thing you survived.

323
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,912
[ASTA]
Why, you little!

324
00:18:08,995 --> 00:18:11,581
[CITIZEN 70AA] Whoa, that
magic power was devastating.

325
00:18:11,664 --> 00:18:13,708
[CITIZEN 70AB]
And he blocked it!

326
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:16,419
[SEKKE]
They're shah- <i>ha</i> ckingly strong!

327
00:18:16,503 --> 00:18:19,005
I invite anyone who still
doubts their worthiness

328
00:18:19,089 --> 00:18:20,715
to please step forward,

329
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,134
now that you've witnessed
their abilities.

330
00:18:23,218 --> 00:18:25,720
Yes, it's true these
two are commoners,

331
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:27,931
but they've worked harder
than any of their peers

332
00:18:28,014 --> 00:18:30,266
to make it where they are today.

333
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:32,686
Proud citizens of
the Clover Kingdom,

334
00:18:32,769 --> 00:18:35,647
let us commend these
brave knights!

335
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:38,358
Regardless of rank or status,
our nation's path

336
00:18:38,441 --> 00:18:40,902
to victory is to
join together as one!

337
00:18:40,985 --> 00:18:42,404
[CITIZEN 70AC]
Wizard King.

338
00:18:42,487 --> 00:18:43,988
[CITIZEN 70AD]
Commoners aren't so bad.

339
00:18:44,072 --> 00:18:45,198
[CITIZEN 70AE]
Hear, hear!

340
00:18:45,281 --> 00:18:47,492
This is no time to dwell
on our differences!

341
00:18:47,575 --> 00:18:49,661
[CITIZEN 70AF]
We can all fight together!

342
00:18:53,498 --> 00:18:54,582
Yuno.

343
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,084
Yeah.

344
00:18:56,167 --> 00:18:59,504
Look at us.

345
00:18:59,587 --> 00:19:02,090
We've really come this far.

346
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:06,761
[ASTA]
It's me again, guys!

347
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:08,346
Someday...

348
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:10,181
[YUNO]
Someday...

349
00:19:10,265 --> 00:19:12,726
[ASTA, YUNO]
I'll become the Wizard King!

350
00:19:14,936 --> 00:19:16,980
Every time I cut it
down, it grows back!

351
00:19:17,063 --> 00:19:19,065
If we keep going like this,
we'll never get anywhere!

352
00:19:19,149 --> 00:19:22,235
[REKKA]
Father! Hang in there!

353
00:19:22,318 --> 00:19:23,862
[CHILDREN sobbing]

354
00:19:23,945 --> 00:19:26,906
Please don't die, okay?

355
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:30,118
[ASTA] Poison? The demon-slayer
sword can fix that!

356
00:19:30,201 --> 00:19:32,245
Just like it did before, right?

357
00:19:35,457 --> 00:19:39,085
[ASTA] Hey, Yuno! Can I
leave it to you for now?

358
00:19:39,169 --> 00:19:40,295
[YUNO]
Yeah, I'm fine.

359
00:19:40,378 --> 00:19:42,380
I can win this with
my eyes closed!

360
00:19:42,464 --> 00:19:46,343
He's all yours then. I gotta
do somethin' real quick!

361
00:19:46,426 --> 00:19:47,761
Hold on!

362
00:19:47,844 --> 00:19:49,471
[REKKA]
Asta! Please help!

363
00:19:49,554 --> 00:19:52,599
He protected us, and he
ended up getting hurt!

364
00:20:01,566 --> 00:20:02,817
Here goes!

365
00:20:04,486 --> 00:20:06,029
[LILY, NASH gasp]

366
00:20:10,325 --> 00:20:12,410
Why didn't it work?

367
00:20:12,494 --> 00:20:16,081
[ASTA] He's not under any
spell! This is bad news!

368
00:20:16,164 --> 00:20:17,248
The magic's run its course,

369
00:20:17,332 --> 00:20:20,377
and the poison's spread
through his body!

370
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,754
[HIGH PRIEST groans]

371
00:20:22,837 --> 00:20:24,339
[ARLU]
I'm so scared!

372
00:20:24,422 --> 00:20:27,133
[HIGH PRIEST]
I-I think this is the end.

373
00:20:27,217 --> 00:20:29,761
You can't give up so soon!
Just stay with me!

374
00:20:29,844 --> 00:20:32,180
It's all right.

375
00:20:33,223 --> 00:20:37,268
[HIGH PRIEST] In the end, I got
to see you and Yuno again,

376
00:20:37,352 --> 00:20:41,314
all grown up and strong.
That's enough for me.

377
00:20:41,398 --> 00:20:45,652
I'll think of it as God's reward
for the deeds I've done.

378
00:20:45,735 --> 00:20:47,487
Don't talk like that!

379
00:20:51,241 --> 00:20:57,872
[HIGH PRIEST sputters]
Our little Asta. I'm so proud.

380
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:03,253
Take care of them for me.

381
00:21:04,671 --> 00:21:06,172
[REKKA, ARLU, HORO]
Father!

382
00:21:11,594 --> 00:21:13,138
[ASTA]
No.

383
00:21:30,613 --> 00:21:32,365
[ASTA]
Not yet.

384
00:21:32,449 --> 00:21:35,285
You're not done yet!
You hear me?

385
00:21:35,368 --> 00:21:38,371
Don't die. You can't die!

386
00:21:38,455 --> 00:21:39,748
You were supposed
to stick around

387
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:41,750
for a while to watch over us.

388
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:46,546
To see me through!
To see all of us through!

389
00:21:55,972 --> 00:21:59,809
[ASTA]
That sword. It's his!

390
00:21:59,893 --> 00:22:02,771
I saw it back at the
Midnight Sun's hideout!

391
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:05,815
It must've slipped into
my grimoire somehow!

392
00:22:10,153 --> 00:22:13,031
[ASTA]
Maybe if I use it, I can...!

393
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:24,292
[ASTA screams]

394
00:23:56,801 --> 00:23:58,970
[HIGH PRIEST] It seems like
only yesterday I was changing

395
00:23:59,054 --> 00:24:00,764
their diapers,
and now look at them!

396
00:24:00,847 --> 00:24:03,767
You two boys will always
be my precious sons!

397
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:07,520
<i>Black Clover</i> , Page 103:
"Release from Misfortune."

398
00:24:07,604 --> 00:24:10,648
I should be clear.
You're <i>like</i> sons to me.
