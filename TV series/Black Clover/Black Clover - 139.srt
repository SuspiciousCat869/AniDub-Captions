that will soon befall

It was foolish of you

modify fate, Vanessa.

00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:40,987
Yeah, I bet those
dumb sounds of yours

163
00:09:41,071 --> 00:09:43,573
would lead the bad
guys right to us.

164
00:09:43,656 --> 00:09:44,657
Let's just go.

165
00:09:44,741 --> 00:09:47,202
We're nothing but
failures, anyway.

166
00:09:47,285 --> 00:09:48,495
[VANESSA]
The way Samantha panics

167
00:09:48,578 --> 00:09:52,207
over every little thing
reminds me of Grey.

168
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:56,586
And Elvira's so stubborn
and prideful, like Noelle is.

169
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,046
At the end of the day,
there's probably

170
00:09:58,129 --> 00:10:01,508
not much difference between
them and the Black Bulls.

171
00:10:01,591 --> 00:10:03,385
We might as well wrap
things up for now,

172
00:10:03,468 --> 00:10:05,470
since, uh, we've
done all we can.

173
00:10:05,553 --> 00:10:06,388
You're free to go.

174
00:10:06,471 --> 00:10:08,473
I'll figure it out by tomorrow.

175
00:10:08,556 --> 00:10:09,724
[SAMANTHA]
Sorry again.

176
00:10:09,808 --> 00:10:12,268
[ELVIRA] It's not like
anything's gonna change.

177
00:10:14,312 --> 00:10:18,650
They're useless! I can't
do this with just them!

178
00:10:18,733 --> 00:10:20,360
When wartime arrives,

179
00:10:20,443 --> 00:10:22,946
I'll need as many
bodies as possible.

180
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:24,656
So you want me to
whip them into shape

181
00:10:24,739 --> 00:10:26,366
so they can fight against Spade?

182
00:10:26,449 --> 00:10:29,035
But that's going
to take an eternity!

183
00:10:29,119 --> 00:10:30,870
Wait, I get it now.

184
00:10:30,954 --> 00:10:33,456
You planned this from
the start, didn't you?

185
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,750
Whatever do you mean?

186
00:10:35,834 --> 00:10:37,877
[VANESSA] You gave me
something impossible to do,

187
00:10:37,961 --> 00:10:40,630
because you're hoping
I'll just give up!

188
00:10:42,257 --> 00:10:45,719
Tell me what your magic
is used for, Vanessa.

189
00:10:47,762 --> 00:10:49,514
[WITCHES laughing]

190
00:10:49,597 --> 00:10:50,765
Hey, guess what?

191
00:10:50,849 --> 00:10:52,934
Oh, don't bother, we've
already heard all about

192
00:10:53,018 --> 00:10:55,437
the Queen making Vanessa
train those two losers.

193
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,273
[WITCH 57C] It won't work,
this is Elvira and Samantha

194
00:10:58,356 --> 00:10:59,691
we're talking about.

195
00:10:59,774 --> 00:11:02,861
[WITCH 57B laughs] The Queen's
got a sense of humor.

196
00:11:02,944 --> 00:11:05,613
[WITCH 57C] Yeah, Vanessa may be
Little Miss Special or whatever,

197
00:11:05,697 --> 00:11:08,116
but this is something not
even she could pull off.

198
00:11:08,199 --> 00:11:10,285
[WITCH 57F]
What a disaster!

199
00:11:10,368 --> 00:11:11,786
[VANESSA]
I can hear you guys.

200
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,329
[WITCHES chattering]

201
00:11:13,413 --> 00:11:16,541
[VANESSA] I guess the witches
here are the same as always.

202
00:11:16,624 --> 00:11:17,834
I'm so bummed out.

203
00:11:17,917 --> 00:11:20,045
The cake shop I was
talking about closed down.

204
00:11:20,128 --> 00:11:22,797
Aw, that's sad.

205
00:11:22,881 --> 00:11:25,592
[VANESSA] They sure love
to talk, don't they?

206
00:11:25,675 --> 00:11:27,260
But, I've never been
able to participate

207
00:11:27,344 --> 00:11:29,763
in their conversations.

208
00:11:29,846 --> 00:11:32,140
Maybe it's the same
for those two.

209
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,892
[DOMINANTE] Tell ya what,
I'll cut you a deal!

210
00:11:33,975 --> 00:11:35,101
If you purchase it right now,

211
00:11:35,185 --> 00:11:37,604
you'll get the exclusive
price of 20,000 yul!

212
00:11:37,687 --> 00:11:40,648
But this offer won't
last long, so jump on it!

213
00:11:40,732 --> 00:11:42,317
It's you!

214
00:11:43,526 --> 00:11:45,945
Oh! Long time no see, girl!

215
00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:47,489
How have you been?

216
00:11:47,572 --> 00:11:49,574
[VANESSA]
Domina's here, too?

217
00:11:57,665 --> 00:11:58,625
That makes sense.

218
00:11:58,708 --> 00:11:59,834
I knew it would take
something major

219
00:11:59,918 --> 00:12:01,294
to bring you back to the forest.

220
00:12:01,378 --> 00:12:03,296
[VANESSA]
Yeah, and what about you?

221
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,507
Well, you know.
My darling other half

222
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:08,051
isn't exactly the most
employable guy out there.

223
00:12:08,134 --> 00:12:10,428
Since he's a
wanted man, and all.

224
00:12:10,512 --> 00:12:12,430
He's spending his time
on farming, at least,

225
00:12:12,514 --> 00:12:15,433
but it's not enough to
support the three of us.

226
00:12:15,517 --> 00:12:17,852
So I have no choice but to
work my poor little fingers

227
00:12:17,936 --> 00:12:20,438
to the bone peddling
these magic items.

228
00:12:20,522 --> 00:12:22,399
Believe me, it's a struggle.

229
00:12:22,482 --> 00:12:25,527
I'm surprised the Queen
gave you permission.

230
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:28,113
Yeah, true, seeing as how
I escaped this place,

231
00:12:28,196 --> 00:12:29,572
like you did.

232
00:12:29,656 --> 00:12:30,949
Well, maybe she thinks

233
00:12:31,032 --> 00:12:33,451
letting me sell my wares
here can help her.

234
00:12:33,535 --> 00:12:35,328
You're good at what
you do, so I imagine

235
00:12:35,412 --> 00:12:37,539
if she lets anyone do it,
you're the obvious choice.

236
00:12:37,622 --> 00:12:40,667
Naturally. You're in
a rough spot, though.

237
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,920
For sure. I'm really
at a loss here.

238
00:12:44,004 --> 00:12:45,130
[DOMINANTE]
If that's the case,

239
00:12:45,213 --> 00:12:46,840
then I think I have
the perfect solution!

240
00:12:46,923 --> 00:12:48,299
Huh?

241
00:12:48,383 --> 00:12:49,718
[DOMINANTE]
Ta-dah!

242
00:12:49,801 --> 00:12:51,761
A magic washboard that removes
the toughest of stains,

243
00:12:51,845 --> 00:12:52,971
depending on your mana!

244
00:12:53,054 --> 00:12:55,557
Only 80,000 yul for you,
since we're friends!

245
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,226
[VANESSA] Will this thing really
help me defeat magical beasts?

246
00:12:58,309 --> 00:12:59,227
I'unno!

247
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:00,478
Ugh.

248
00:13:00,562 --> 00:13:01,604
Ready to check out?

249
00:13:01,688 --> 00:13:02,939
Whoa, slow down!

250
00:13:03,023 --> 00:13:04,315
Why would I buy that thing

251
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,568
when I don't even know
if it'll be of any use to me?

252
00:13:06,651 --> 00:13:09,904
Hey! Anything's
useful for something!

253
00:13:09,988 --> 00:13:11,322
And that goes for people, too.

254
00:13:11,406 --> 00:13:13,324
After all, the Queen of Witches
can find a way to use

255
00:13:13,408 --> 00:13:15,785
every girl in this forest
to do her bidding, right?

256
00:13:15,869 --> 00:13:17,579
It's as simple as that!

257
00:13:17,662 --> 00:13:19,039
[VANESSA]
Hm.

258
00:13:19,122 --> 00:13:20,790
What? Is something wrong?

259
00:13:20,874 --> 00:13:22,459
[VANESSA]
Um, no.

260
00:13:26,171 --> 00:13:29,674
[QUEEN OF WITCHES] Tell me what
your magic is used for, Vanessa.

261
00:13:35,555 --> 00:13:36,473
Listen, girls.

262
00:13:36,556 --> 00:13:37,891
I've decided that
the three of us

263
00:13:37,974 --> 00:13:40,060
are going to rid the forest
of those magical beasts.

264
00:13:40,143 --> 00:13:43,271
I'm sorry, ma'am, but I'm
really not capable of that.

265
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:44,939
This is a waste of time.

266
00:13:45,023 --> 00:13:48,526
No it isn't. I know
we'll succeed.

267
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:51,654
Why? Because we're
the only ones who can!

268
00:13:51,738 --> 00:13:54,491
Uh, you seem weirdly
confident about that.

269
00:13:54,574 --> 00:13:56,701
What makes you so certain?

270
00:13:56,785 --> 00:13:58,453
[VANESSA]
Take a look at this map.

271
00:13:58,536 --> 00:14:00,372
Here's the Forest of Witches,

272
00:14:00,455 --> 00:14:03,625
and that's where
the monsters are.

273
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,335
Many of the smaller
magical beasts

274
00:14:05,418 --> 00:14:07,671
like to forage for nuts
around this area.

275
00:14:07,754 --> 00:14:09,089
And the bigger ones know that,

276
00:14:09,172 --> 00:14:12,926
which is why they always
come here to pick them off.

277
00:14:13,009 --> 00:14:14,427
You see this place?

278
00:14:14,511 --> 00:14:16,805
There are several trees there
that are loaded with nuts,

279
00:14:16,888 --> 00:14:19,516
which means it's a popular
spot for the small beasts,

280
00:14:19,599 --> 00:14:21,768
and I saw some big ones
lurking around, as well.

281
00:14:21,851 --> 00:14:23,478
Did you say you saw them?

282
00:14:23,561 --> 00:14:26,773
I spent all last
night investigating.

283
00:14:26,856 --> 00:14:29,109
Oh, wow! You looked at me!

284
00:14:29,192 --> 00:14:30,735
Yeah, who cares?

285
00:14:31,986 --> 00:14:33,530
The rest is easy.

286
00:14:33,613 --> 00:14:35,573
We have to lead the
larger monsters this way

287
00:14:35,657 --> 00:14:38,326
before they get too
far into the forest.

288
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:41,371
After that, we should
be rid of them.

289
00:14:41,454 --> 00:14:43,081
It can't be that simple.

290
00:14:43,164 --> 00:14:44,124
We're weak.

291
00:14:44,207 --> 00:14:46,167
There's no way
we can control them.

292
00:14:46,251 --> 00:14:47,419
It's impossible.

293
00:14:47,502 --> 00:14:50,672
We can do it. Just trust me!

294
00:14:50,755 --> 00:14:53,925
A while ago, I felt
the same way as you do.

295
00:14:54,009 --> 00:14:57,095
I had given up hope. But...

296
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,641
Wow, what happened?

297
00:15:01,725 --> 00:15:02,976
Such pretty dolls!

298
00:15:03,059 --> 00:15:05,603
They're so tiny!

299
00:15:05,687 --> 00:15:07,272
[VANESSA]
Think back.

300
00:15:07,355 --> 00:15:10,316
To when you were first
learning to wield your magic.

301
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,944
You wondered what it
could be useful for.

302
00:15:13,028 --> 00:15:15,113
Everybody wonders that.

303
00:15:15,196 --> 00:15:17,115
As for me...

304
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:19,242
I wanted to make people smile.

305
00:15:19,325 --> 00:15:22,704
That was the one idea
I never let go of.

306
00:15:22,787 --> 00:15:26,374
And even these days,
I don't want people to cry.

307
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,626
I'm glad you like the dolls,
but wouldn't it be nice

308
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:30,837
if they had more
color and detail?

309
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,381
[LITTLE WITCHES]
Ooh!

310
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:36,009
Fine, if it means
that much to you.

311
00:15:38,678 --> 00:15:39,971
[LITTLE WITCHES]
So cool!

312
00:15:40,055 --> 00:15:42,515
That's not all; these
happen to be talking dolls!

313
00:15:42,599 --> 00:15:44,059
[LITTLE WITCHES]
Wow!

314
00:15:46,686 --> 00:15:48,646
Oh, my gosh, guys,
when I went to town yesterday,

315
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:51,232
I just had to make a stop
at my favorite store!

316
00:15:51,316 --> 00:15:52,484
Again, huh?

317

We just made these

have always been connected,

to affect both of them.

and made my own decisions!
