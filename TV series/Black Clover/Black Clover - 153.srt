1
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:23,972
[NARRATOR]
The Clover Kingdom.

2
00:00:24,055 --> 00:00:26,433
In this place where
magic is everything,

3
00:00:26,516 --> 00:00:29,394
there lives one boy
who was born without it.

4
00:00:29,477 --> 00:00:31,646
His name is Asta.

5
00:00:33,398 --> 00:00:34,774
[NARRATOR]
His strength and determination

6
00:00:34,858 --> 00:00:37,110
helped him become
a Magic Knight.

7
00:00:37,193 --> 00:00:39,779
And despite the many
challenges he faces,

8
00:00:39,863 --> 00:00:43,283
he aims for the top
and refuses to give up!

9
00:00:43,366 --> 00:00:44,951
Rich or poor,

10
00:00:45,035 --> 00:00:47,078
royalty or commoner,

11
00:00:47,162 --> 00:00:49,998
Asta believes anyone can shine.

12
00:00:50,081 --> 00:00:53,043
His mission is to prove
that to the whole world,

13
00:00:53,126 --> 00:00:55,879
and to become the
next Wizard King!

14
00:00:59,007 --> 00:01:00,884
[MARX] Even the parts
of the Forsaken Realm

15
00:01:00,967 --> 00:01:04,763
that were hardest hit by the
enemy have begun to recover.

16
00:01:04,846 --> 00:01:06,222
Things are finally
looking brighter

17
00:01:06,306 --> 00:01:08,683
for the kingdom as a whole.

18
00:01:08,767 --> 00:01:11,603
[JULIUS] Yes. And to make
this an everlasting peace

19
00:01:11,686 --> 00:01:14,981
rather than a fleeting one,
we all need to remain strong,

20
00:01:15,065 --> 00:01:17,108
whatever comes our way.

21
00:01:17,192 --> 00:01:19,027
Hope you're ready
to work, sir.

22
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,320
We've got the captains' meeting

23
00:01:20,403 --> 00:01:22,655
as well as the
decoration ceremony.

24
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:25,075
Your schedule is packed today.

25
00:02:59,461 --> 00:03:01,796
Our topic for today
is who will participate

26
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,215
in the Heart Kingdom's training.

27
00:03:04,299 --> 00:03:06,843
[JULIUS] The battle against the
Spade Kingdom, which we promised

28
00:03:06,926 --> 00:03:10,889
Queen Loropechika we'd help
with, is drawing nearer now.

29
00:03:10,972 --> 00:03:13,058
Of course, I know that
you've all been making

30
00:03:13,141 --> 00:03:16,186
great strides on your own,
but we just received word

31
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:17,687
that they've
completed preparations

32
00:03:17,771 --> 00:03:19,481
for their training
regimen, as well.

33
00:03:19,564 --> 00:03:21,733
We've reached the final step!

34
00:03:21,816 --> 00:03:25,445
There are five Spirit Guardians
who'll be working with us.

35
00:03:25,528 --> 00:03:28,656
Each of them can only take
a certain number of trainees.

36
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,159
As such, I'd like you all to
tell me which subordinates

37
00:03:31,242 --> 00:03:34,037
you'll be nominating
from each of your squads.

38
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,291
Now, then. Which of the
Magic Knights are we sending?

39
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:41,586
Obviously, I pick Asta
and Nero, especially since

40
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:44,673
the Heart Kingdom already
told us they wanted 'em.

41
00:03:44,756 --> 00:03:48,885
[JULIUS] Asta uses Anti-magic,
and Nero wields forbidden magic.

42
00:03:48,968 --> 00:03:51,846
Not only that, but they're
both at the arcane stage.

43
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,140
We know from experience
that their unique abilities

44
00:03:54,224 --> 00:03:57,060
will be a tremendous
asset in this fight.

45
00:03:57,143 --> 00:03:58,812
And through further
training, I'm sure they'll

46
00:03:58,895 --> 00:04:01,815
find ways to amplify
their strengths even more.

47
00:04:01,898 --> 00:04:06,277
I'll send Finral and Luck, too.
Oh, and Noelle, definitely.

48
00:04:07,445 --> 00:04:10,115
Aw, what's wrong?
Are you worried about her?

49
00:04:10,198 --> 00:04:13,368
That's so sweet, you're such
a protective big brother!

50
00:04:13,451 --> 00:04:15,412
I feel like she and Luck
would be a good complement

51
00:04:15,495 --> 00:04:18,123
to the others on account
of their magic types.

52
00:04:18,206 --> 00:04:20,125
Interestingly, one of
the Spirit Guardians

53
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:22,043
uses lightning spells,
and the queen

54
00:04:22,127 --> 00:04:24,629
has the Water Spirit
known as Undine.

55
00:04:24,713 --> 00:04:26,423
When you consider
all of those factors,

56
00:04:26,506 --> 00:04:29,050
I believe your assessment
is right on the money.

57
00:04:29,134 --> 00:04:31,636
Besides, Luck's itching
to go so badly,

58
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,096
he can't stand it.

59
00:04:33,179 --> 00:04:35,098
And it seems like
Noelle is more motivated

60
00:04:35,181 --> 00:04:36,808
now than she's ever been.

61
00:04:36,891 --> 00:04:38,309
[DOROTHY]
That makes sense.

62
00:04:38,393 --> 00:04:41,312
Megicula is the devil who
killed their mother, after all.

63
00:04:41,396 --> 00:04:45,233
And, as for Finral...
Well, he's just handy.

64
00:04:45,316 --> 00:04:47,652
We can't underestimate the
importance of support mages

65
00:04:47,736 --> 00:04:50,947
like him, especially if he
improves his skill even more.

66
00:04:51,031 --> 00:04:53,867
Perhaps he'll open up
some new strategies for us.

67
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:56,077
Oh, yeah, that's what
I was gonna say.

68
00:04:56,161 --> 00:04:58,204
From the Black Bulls,
we have five mages.

69
00:04:58,288 --> 00:05:01,875
Asta, Nero, Luck Voltia,
Noelle Silva,

70
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:04,461
and the spatial
mage called Finral.

71
00:05:04,544 --> 00:05:06,338
That's more than I expected.

72
00:05:06,421 --> 00:05:08,840
That's 'cause I've got
plenty of good people!

73
00:05:08,923 --> 00:05:10,967
Should be a fairly
strong lineup.

74
00:05:11,051 --> 00:05:13,303
As for the Golden
Dawn's nomination,

75
00:05:13,386 --> 00:05:16,097
I submit Mimosa Vermillion.

76
00:05:16,181 --> 00:05:18,850
We're fighting a devil,
so I'm certain

77
00:05:18,933 --> 00:05:21,936
the conflict ahead
will be brutal.

78
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:26,483
We can't hope to succeed
without recovery mages.

79
00:05:26,566 --> 00:05:30,153
Because she's a royal,
she was born with great talent.

80
00:05:30,236 --> 00:05:32,655
If we can help her
to reach her full potential,

81
00:05:32,739 --> 00:05:34,616
then that bodes well for us.

82
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:36,201
A wise choice.

83
00:05:36,284 --> 00:05:39,579
But is she your only nomination?
I hear the Wind Spirit Guardian

84
00:05:39,662 --> 00:05:41,623
is going to be
involved, after all.

85
00:05:41,706 --> 00:05:43,875
Actually, Yuno has declined.

86
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:46,878
Knowing him, I assume
he had his reasons.

87
00:05:48,338 --> 00:05:50,882
And who are the candidates
from all the other squads?

88
00:05:50,965 --> 00:05:52,801
From the Crimson Lion Kings,

89
00:05:52,884 --> 00:05:55,929
we have chosen
Leopold Vermillion.

90
00:05:56,012 --> 00:05:58,223
Leo's ambition
is extremely high.

91
00:05:58,306 --> 00:06:01,267
In fact, he asked our sister,
Mereoleona, to help him train

92
00:06:01,351 --> 00:06:04,354
at the volcano in the
strong magic region.

93
00:06:04,437 --> 00:06:06,856
Just thinkin' about
that makes me tired.

94
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:09,150
No one in my squad
can match Leo's passion

95
00:06:09,234 --> 00:06:12,529
and work ethic,
but he's still hesitant.

96
00:06:12,612 --> 00:06:14,864
I'm hoping that this opportunity
will ignite a flame

97
00:06:14,948 --> 00:06:18,368
within his heart that burns
away that hesitation.

98
00:06:18,451 --> 00:06:21,413
If he can overcome that,
then not only will he be

99
00:06:21,496 --> 00:06:24,499
a powerful force in our battle
against Spade, but he can guard

100
00:06:24,582 --> 00:06:26,376
this kingdom with all
the strength and pride

101
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:27,627
of a great lion!

102
00:06:27,711 --> 00:06:29,087
Excellent.

103
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:32,382
I look forward to seeing how
much Leo progresses, then.

104
00:06:32,465 --> 00:06:34,634
What about the other squads?

105
00:06:36,219 --> 00:06:37,721
Is there anyone
you wish to nominate

106
00:06:37,804 --> 00:06:40,223
from the Blue Rose Knights?

107
00:06:40,306 --> 00:06:42,100
First, sire, I would
like you to clarify

108
00:06:42,183 --> 00:06:43,685
something for me.

109
00:06:43,768 --> 00:06:46,521
Is it possible for one of the
captains to nominate themselves?

110
00:06:46,604 --> 00:06:48,356
Sure, that's all right.

111
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,151
Since you were possessed by
an elf in that last conflict,

112
00:06:51,234 --> 00:06:52,736
I believe subjecting
you to this training

113
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:55,321
could provide some
interesting results.

114
00:06:57,365 --> 00:06:58,825
[CHARLOTTE]
I still remember how it felt

115
00:06:58,908 --> 00:07:02,495
to have that elf spirit's
power coursing through me.

116
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:06,833
Her red rose mana was
far superior to my own.

117
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:09,044
It doesn't matter how
I increase my strength,

118
00:07:09,127 --> 00:07:11,171
I just know that I must!

119
00:07:11,254 --> 00:07:15,175
I'll do whatever it takes
to experience that again!

120
00:07:15,258 --> 00:07:18,345
Er, and by "experience,"
I meant the magic!

121
00:07:18,428 --> 00:07:19,679
Nothing more!

122
00:07:19,763 --> 00:07:21,723
Then, the only nominee
from the Blue Rose Knights

123
00:07:21,806 --> 00:07:24,476
is Captain Charlotte herself,
is that correct?

124
00:07:24,559 --> 00:07:25,393
[CHARLOTTE]
Yes.

125
00:07:25,477 --> 00:07:27,395
Any other captains?

126
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:29,647
It troubles me to admit it,

127
00:07:29,731 --> 00:07:32,400
but I believe that younger
candidates would be best.

128
00:07:32,484 --> 00:07:34,527
I agree. And I'm quite capable

129
00:07:34,611 --> 00:07:36,780
of conducting my
training on my own.

130
00:07:36,863 --> 00:07:38,031
I'd be glad to go if it means

131
00:07:38,114 --> 00:07:40,116
I get to slash the
Heart Kingdom open.

132
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:40,992
[cackles]

133
00:07:41,076 --> 00:07:42,660
[YAMI]
Yeah, you're not goin'.

134
00:07:42,744 --> 00:07:45,538
I imagine this regimen
will be grueling,

135
00:07:45,622 --> 00:07:47,248
but they'll discover
and learn so much

136
00:07:47,332 --> 00:07:49,626
that they would never have
been able to here in Clover.

137
00:07:49,709 --> 00:07:51,628
They'll be in a brand-new world!

138
00:07:51,711 --> 00:07:54,714
I expect them to take
full advantage of that.

139
00:07:54,798 --> 00:07:58,927
Discovering a new world?

140
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:02,097
[WOLF]
My appetite's insatiable!

141
00:08:03,473 --> 00:08:04,557
Keep being vigilant

142
00:08:04,641 --> 00:08:07,143
and training with
your magic every day!

143
00:08:07,227 --> 00:08:11,231
That would... take... protein.

144
00:08:11,314 --> 00:08:13,858
[CHARMY] Eat this!
That's for the protein!

145
00:08:13,942 --> 00:08:16,277
[JULIUS] Each one of you
has amazing potential.

146
00:08:16,361 --> 00:08:18,279
I'd like to see it
grow even more!

147
00:08:18,363 --> 00:08:20,532
[RILL]
Growing, yeah!

148
00:08:20,615 --> 00:08:23,034
[CHARMY] And this!
That one's for the fat!

149
00:08:23,118 --> 00:08:24,619
[RILL gasps]

150
00:08:24,703 --> 00:08:27,872
[CHARMY yells] This is for the
vitamins! This is for the fiber!

151
00:08:27,956 --> 00:08:29,541
This is for the collagen!

152
00:08:29,624 --> 00:08:34,462
[RILL gasps]
Me, me, me, me, me!

153
00:08:34,546 --> 00:08:37,215
Oh, my! Someone's
full of energy!

154
00:08:37,298 --> 00:08:39,342
Yeah, where the heck
did that come from?

155
00:08:39,426 --> 00:08:40,927
The only person
I want to nominate

156
00:08:41,011 --> 00:08:43,513
from the Aqua Deer is me!

157
00:08:43,596 --> 00:08:46,182
[RILL] If I get stronger,
then maybe that nice,

158
00:08:46,266 --> 00:08:48,351
beautiful lady will notice me!

159
00:08:48,435 --> 00:08:51,896
We've probably selected
enough candidates at this point,

160
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,857
but are there any others?

161
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,067
I don't have anyone
from the Silver Eagles,

162
00:08:56,151 --> 00:08:58,570
but I assure you, we'll train
to the best of our ability

163
00:08:58,653 --> 00:09:01,239
and be ready for the fight
against the Spade Kingdom.

164
00:09:01,322 --> 00:09:02,490
As will we.

165
00:09:02,574 --> 00:09:04,492
And we're going to
handle things our way!

166
00:09:04,576 --> 00:09:05,410
[cackles]

167
00:09:05,493 --> 00:09:07,203
Well, then, do we all agree

168
00:09:07,287 --> 00:09:09,164
on the candidates
who were proposed?

169
00:09:09,247 --> 00:09:10,915
[CAPTAINS]
I approve.

170
00:09:10,999 --> 00:09:12,125
Lovely!

171
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,711
I'm expecting great
things from this group.

172
00:09:14,794 --> 00:09:15,920
[CAPTAINS]
Sir!

173
00:09:16,004 --> 00:09:17,839
Very well, then.
Today's captains' meeting

174
00:09:17,922 --> 00:09:20,008
is officially adjourned.

175
00:09:20,091 --> 00:09:23,261
Good. That's finally over.

176
00:09:23,345 --> 00:09:24,846
See ya.

177
00:09:27,182 --> 00:09:29,476
And just where do you
think you're going?

178
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:32,645
The decoration ceremony
is about to start.

179
00:09:32,729 --> 00:09:35,690
Ugh, do I really
have to go to that?

180
00:09:35,774 --> 00:09:38,818
But I got my wheels
parked out front.

181
00:09:38,902 --> 00:09:41,154
And my squad never gets picked.

182
00:09:41,237 --> 00:09:42,989
We were told that
all nine captains

183
00:09:43,073 --> 00:09:44,866
are required to
be in attendance.

184
00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:46,993
[YAMI]
What? Why?

185
00:09:47,077 --> 00:09:49,496
[MARX]
Well, you see,

186
00:09:49,579 --> 00:09:50,997
apparently the king himself

187
00:09:51,081 --> 00:09:53,375
is going to
participate this time.

188
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:54,959
You're kidding me.

189
00:10:06,888 --> 00:10:09,599
[SEKKE] The captains from
every squad, in one room!

190
00:10:09,683 --> 00:10:12,018
It's an a- <i>ha</i> ll-star lineup!

191
00:10:12,102 --> 00:10:13,895
[KING CLOVER] I see they
required all the captains

192
00:10:13,978 --> 00:10:16,314
to attend since they knew
I'd be making an appearance.

193
00:10:16,398 --> 00:10:18,733
Exactly as it should be!

194
00:10:18,817 --> 00:10:21,569
Up till now, the king's only
seen me at a distance.

195
00:10:21,653 --> 00:10:23,947
He's bound to figure it out!

196
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,657
[SEKKE]
Captain Jack!

197
00:10:26,741 --> 00:10:28,243
[YAMI, JACK]
Hm?

198
00:10:28,326 --> 00:10:29,661
[SEKKE]
Will you...

199
00:10:29,744 --> 00:10:31,287
...let me...

200
00:10:31,371 --> 00:10:33,248
...come back to the...

201
00:10:33,331 --> 00:10:34,874
...squa- <i>ha</i> d?

202
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:36,167
[YAMI]
What's with him?

203
00:10:36,251 --> 00:10:39,587
Guess he needs me
to slice him to pieces!

204
00:10:39,671 --> 00:10:41,047
[yelps]

205
00:10:41,131 --> 00:10:43,800
I believe everyone
is present now.

206
00:10:43,883 --> 00:10:45,927
Then I say we start.

207
00:10:47,512 --> 00:10:49,472
Attention, all.

208
00:10:49,556 --> 00:10:52,600
This is a special decoration
ceremony for the Magic Knights

209
00:10:52,684 --> 00:10:56,563
who bravely fought against
the Eye of the Midnight Sun.

210
00:10:56,646 --> 00:10:59,315
The Wizard King is still
unable to use his voice,

211
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:01,693
so I'll be conducting
this myself.

212
00:11:01,776 --> 00:11:03,737
Without further ado...

213
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:07,699
Sol Marron of the Blue
Rose Knights, with 21 stars.

214
00:11:07,782 --> 00:11:11,828
As of today, you'll be a
fifth-class Senior Magic Knight.

215
00:11:11,911 --> 00:11:14,330
With your calm, quick
thinking, you were able

216
00:11:14,414 --> 00:11:17,500
to transport the injured
Wizard King to safety.

217
00:11:17,584 --> 00:11:18,877
Please continue to exercise

218
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,547
that wise judgment
on the battlefield.

219
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:23,757
My, my!

220
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,176
That young lady moved up
three ranks at once!

221
00:11:26,259 --> 00:11:28,678
She did save the
Wizard King's life,

222
00:11:28,762 --> 00:11:32,807
so I'd say she's more than
deserving of such a promotion.

223
00:11:32,891 --> 00:11:35,310
[SOL] To be honest,
I wasn't calm at all.

224
00:11:35,393 --> 00:11:37,645
Not to mention, Char had to
be rescued by the captain

225
00:11:37,729 --> 00:11:40,857
of the Black Bulls,
of all people!

226
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,734
Next time, I'll protect
her without the help

227
00:11:42,817 --> 00:11:45,070
of some dumb, disgusting man!

228
00:11:46,446 --> 00:11:48,239
Heads up, your subordinate's

229
00:11:48,323 --> 00:11:50,909
starin' me down
somethin' serious.

230
00:11:50,992 --> 00:11:52,494
Is that so?

231
00:11:52,577 --> 00:11:54,913
[CHARLOTTE]
She's staring at Yami?

232
00:11:54,996 --> 00:11:57,040
Oh, no! Please, Sol!

233
00:11:57,123 --> 00:11:59,417
Don't tell me you
like him, as well?

234
00:11:59,501 --> 00:12:01,127
Huh?

235
00:12:01,211 --> 00:12:03,296
[SOL] Wow, she looks
so passionate!

236
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:06,466
Don't worry, Char.
I won't let you down!

237
00:12:06,549 --> 00:12:09,636
Next, with 23 stars,

238
00:12:09,719 --> 00:12:12,305
the Golden Dawn's
Mimosa Vermillion.

239
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:16,434
You're now a Second-Class
Intermediate Magic Knight.

240
00:12:16,518 --> 00:12:18,937
During the battle at the
Shadow Palace, you showed

241
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,439
great humanity while
effectively fulfilling your duty

242
00:12:21,523 --> 00:12:23,650
as a recovery mage.

243
00:12:23,733 --> 00:12:28,196
And we know that you'll save
many more lives in the future.

244
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:29,948
If you ask me,
Mimosa's the reason

245
00:12:30,031 --> 00:12:32,117
why so many more people
understand the importance

246
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,452
of recovery magic these days!

247
00:12:34,536 --> 00:12:36,079
[MIMOSA]
This is a great honor.

248
00:12:36,162 --> 00:12:37,539
I'll do my best
to live up to it

249
00:12:37,622 --> 00:12:39,666
during our battle
with the Spade Kingdom.

250
00:12:39,749 --> 00:12:42,168
And with a total of 18 stars,

251
00:12:42,252 --> 00:12:45,338
Leopold Vermillion of
the Crimson Lion Kings.

252
00:12:45,422 --> 00:12:48,883
You are now a Fourth-Class
Senior Magic Knight.

253
00:12:48,967 --> 00:12:51,886
When the captains were absent,
you rallied your cohorts

254
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:54,848
and did everything in your power
to stop your vice captain,

255
00:12:54,931 --> 00:12:56,975
who was possessed by an elf.

256
00:12:57,058 --> 00:12:59,394
I hope the strength of your
character will continue

257
00:12:59,477 --> 00:13:01,896
to lead us down
the path to victory.

258
00:13:03,565 --> 00:13:05,358
It appears young
Leopold has advanced

259
00:13:05,442 --> 00:13:07,569
by three ranks, as well.

260
00:13:13,324 --> 00:13:15,410
I'm sorry, I can't accept!

261
00:13:15,493 --> 00:13:16,828
[CAPTAINS gasp]

262
00:13:18,955 --> 00:13:21,791
[LEOPOLD] That night, if my
brother hadn't shown up in time,

263
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:24,377
we'd have all been annihilated!

264
00:13:24,461 --> 00:13:25,962
It's true I did
everything I could,

265
00:13:26,046 --> 00:13:28,173
but it still wasn't good enough!

266
00:13:28,256 --> 00:13:30,550
Everyone in my squad fought
really hard to protect me,

267
00:13:30,633 --> 00:13:33,720
even at the risk
of their own lives!

268
00:13:33,803 --> 00:13:37,098
Truth is, I'm only a weakling!

269
00:13:37,182 --> 00:13:39,601
I don't deserve
this recognition!

270
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:43,855
[FUEGOLEON]
You're a fool!

271
00:13:43,938 --> 00:13:46,024
Have you no idea why
they all put their lives

272
00:13:46,107 --> 00:13:48,109
on the line for your sake?

273
00:13:48,193 --> 00:13:50,028
They were moved by your courage.

274
00:13:50,111 --> 00:13:53,698
Your very existence inspired
them to move forward!

275
00:13:53,782 --> 00:13:55,450
They knew the future
of our squad

276
00:13:55,533 --> 00:13:57,369
would be safe in your hands!

277
00:13:57,452 --> 00:13:58,953
So accept the award!

278
00:13:59,037 --> 00:14:01,206
It represents the tireless
hope and resolve

279
00:14:01,289 --> 00:14:03,458
of the Crimson Lion Kings!

280
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:05,460
[LEOPOLD]
Hope and resolve?

281
00:14:13,301 --> 00:14:15,095
Please forgive my hesitation!

282
00:14:15,178 --> 00:14:17,972
I, Leopold Vermillion, will
protect my squad and the kingdom

283
00:14:18,056 --> 00:14:20,141
from any foe, and become
a mighty warrior who can

284
00:14:20,225 --> 00:14:22,477
lead the charge to victory!

285
00:14:31,319 --> 00:14:33,488
[MARX] And now Yuno,
from the Golden Dawn.

286
00:14:33,571 --> 00:14:34,489
[YUNO]
Sir.

287
00:14:34,572 --> 00:14:35,657
[KING CLOVER]
Hmph.

288
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:38,118
[MARX] You've earned
77 stars, total.

289
00:14:38,201 --> 00:14:39,244
[GROUP gasps]

290
00:14:39,327 --> 00:14:41,955
Amazing!

291
00:14:42,038 --> 00:14:44,165
During the Star Festival
for this year...

292
00:14:44,249 --> 00:14:47,002
Did he just earn more
than my whole squad?

293
00:14:47,085 --> 00:14:49,754
You're being promoted
as well, Yuno.

294
00:14:49,838 --> 00:14:53,091
To first-class
Senior Magic Knight.

295
00:14:53,174 --> 00:14:54,426
[GROUP gasps]

296
00:14:54,509 --> 00:14:55,468
This brat?!

297
00:14:55,552 --> 00:14:56,803
Wha- <i>ha</i> t?

298
00:14:56,886 --> 00:14:58,596
[KING CLOVER] You would
award a title like that

299
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,516
to a mere commoner?

300
00:15:01,599 --> 00:15:03,476
[MARX] You dealt a fatal
blow to the devil,

301
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,146
who was the source of
all that destruction.

302
00:15:06,229 --> 00:15:09,399
We're very proud of
what you've achieved.

303
00:15:09,482 --> 00:15:10,817
Thanks.

304
00:15:13,361 --> 00:15:16,364
[MIMOSA] Now he's the same rank
as Vice Captain Langris.

305
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:17,991
I can't believe Yuno's
already made it

306
00:15:18,074 --> 00:15:21,202
one step below
the Squad Captains!

307
00:15:21,286 --> 00:15:22,829
I don't really know
what's going on,

308
00:15:22,912 --> 00:15:24,497
but it sounds pretty good!

309
00:15:24,581 --> 00:15:25,957
Great job, Yuno!

310
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:27,959
We should celebrate
with a date--!

311
00:15:30,211 --> 00:15:33,048
[YUNO]
First-class Senior Magic Knight.

312
00:15:33,131 --> 00:15:35,592
I'm that much closer.

313
00:15:35,675 --> 00:15:37,344
These four mages have display--

314
00:15:37,427 --> 00:15:39,346
Hold on just a minute!

[MAGIC KNIGHTS gasp]

316
00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:42,182
Man, I get a headache

317
00:15:42,265 --> 00:15:44,309
every time that guy
opens his mouth.

318
00:15:44,392 --> 00:15:47,312
Let's show some respect.
Although, I don't disagree.

319
00:15:47,395 --> 00:15:49,773
You do realize that's
just as bad, right?

320
00:15:49,856 --> 00:15:51,775
You fools failed to
recognize the person

321
00:15:51,858 --> 00:15:54,527
whose achievements in the
last battle were second to none!

322
00:15:54,611 --> 00:15:55,820
[CAPTAINS]
Hm?

323
00:15:55,904 --> 00:15:57,072
[KING CLOVER] The hero
who guarded our kingdom's

324
00:15:57,155 --> 00:15:59,240
most precious treasure!

325
00:16:01,201 --> 00:16:03,745
What about the great
Sekke Bronzazza?

326
00:16:03,828 --> 00:16:05,205
Bah- <i>ha</i> ?

327
00:16:06,539 --> 00:16:08,416
Not only did you slugs
have the audacity

328
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,252
to leave your king
unattended in a crisis,

329
00:16:11,336 --> 00:16:15,006
but certain parties were nasty
enough to attack me, as well!

330
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:17,133
I kind of wish I would've
run him through.

331
00:16:17,217 --> 00:16:18,385
Cool, shut up.

332
00:16:18,468 --> 00:16:21,054
The glory belongs
to Sekke, not to them!

333
00:16:21,137 --> 00:16:23,682
He's the real hero!

334
00:16:23,765 --> 00:16:26,726
During that awful confrontation,
he bravely dodged

335
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:28,895
the enemy's spells
and rushed to my rescue

336
00:16:28,978 --> 00:16:30,730
on that strange vehicle of his!

337
00:16:30,814 --> 00:16:32,065
None of these other neophytes

338
00:16:32,148 --> 00:16:34,109
even attempted
to help their king.

339
00:16:34,192 --> 00:16:37,112
They should be punished,
not praised!

340
00:16:40,198 --> 00:16:43,118
[SEKKE] Ah- <i>ha</i> nestly,
I just kinda showed up.

341
00:16:43,201 --> 00:16:46,413
By my authority as
ruler of this kingdom...

342
00:16:48,456 --> 00:16:49,958
...I award to Sekke the title

343
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:52,210
of first-class
Senior Magic Knight!

344

[GROUP gasps]

345
00:16:54,087 --> 00:16:57,507
[SEKKE] Did he say "first-class
Senior Magic Knight"?

346
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,551
That's like the cream
of the crah- <i>ha</i> p!

347
00:16:59,634 --> 00:17:02,345
[KING CLOVER] If that riffraff
is worthy of such prestige,

348
00:17:02,429 --> 00:17:05,640
then there's no reason I can't
promote Sekke to the same level!

Uh-oh.

[SEKKE]
Oh, my gah- <i>ha</i> d.

00:17:11,813 --> 00:17:13,523
I've never felt this
hated in my life.

353
00:17:13,606 --> 00:17:16,317
They're gonna have my head!

354
00:17:16,401 --> 00:17:17,777
Right!

355
00:17:17,861 --> 00:17:19,571
It's a privilege to accept
such an honor, Your Majesty!

356
00:17:19,654 --> 00:17:20,613
I give you my word.

357
00:17:20,697 --> 00:17:23,074
I will fight, and, um, win!

358
00:17:23,158 --> 00:17:24,659
No matter what...

359
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:27,078
No matter what, I will always
take great pride in protecting

360
00:17:27,162 --> 00:17:28,580
the Clover Kingdom
with my very life,

361
00:17:28,663 --> 00:17:30,373
and that's a prah- <i>ha</i> mise!

362
00:17:30,457 --> 00:17:33,293
[SEKKE]
So, please don't kill me, okay?

363
00:17:35,462 --> 00:17:38,131
Well, then, will
that be all, sir?

364
00:17:38,214 --> 00:17:39,924
Yes! I hope the rest of you

365
00:17:40,008 --> 00:17:41,843
will follow his example
and always make me

your utmost priority. Forever!

[SEKKE] Whew, that was
a close cah- <i>ha</i> ll.

00:17:51,102 --> 00:17:54,939
Ah-hem. Now, as I was saying.

369

Those five knights aside,
everyone else who fought against

370

373
00:18:05,116 --> 00:18:07,619
That must be why they asked
all the captains to attend.

374
00:18:07,702 --> 00:18:09,454
[DOROTHY] I knew that
old blowhard being here

375
00:18:09,537 --> 00:18:12,749
wasn't a good enough reason
to require us to come.

376
00:18:12,832 --> 00:18:16,044
[WILLIAM] The Wizard King cares
so deeply for our squads.

who risked their lives
will be rewarded.

If not for the
Magic Parliament trial

381
00:18:23,426 --> 00:18:25,887
causing all that chaos,
there might've been

382
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:27,681
many more promotions.

award them at this time,

to let me go, too!

sit here on my ass!

[MAGNA]
If I'm going to be a real man,

then I refuse to be
left behind anymore!

I'll go, even if you
tell me to stay here!

[YAMI]
With mana like yours,

438
00:21:01,751 --> 00:21:05,672
you're likely to
get yourself killed.

439

You good with that?

440

[MAGNA]
Yes, sir!

441
00:21:09,092 --> 00:21:11,803
I can push past
the limits of my mana!

442
00:21:11,886 --> 00:21:14,931
More than any
commoner has before!

All right.

I'll ask Julius if there's
room for another guy.

But just remember one thing.

446
00:21:22,856 --> 00:21:25,650
It doesn't make a damn bit
of difference where you train.

447
00:21:25,734 --> 00:21:27,652
It's how that's important.

448
00:21:27,736 --> 00:21:29,195
You understand?

449
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:30,155

coming with us!

too far ahead of you.

to the top of the ladder

in one step! You really are
the coolest guy ever!

I know you'll become
the Wizard King soon,

maybe sooner than we thought!

Don't be dumb.

It's not like
it'll be that easy.

467

But yeah. Someday.

[YUNO]
It's only a matter of time.

469
00:23:57,218 --> 00:23:59,929
[YUNO] I'll keep following
my own path, and one day,

470
00:24:00,013 --> 00:24:01,806
