1
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:15,666
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,416
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:24,375
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:27,041
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:35,583
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:39,541
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:43,416
[NARRATOR]
Round Two, Match One of the

8
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,666
Royal Knights Selection Exam.

9
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:50,500
[NARRATOR] Sol trapped
Mimosa with her magic.

10
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:52,458
Asta defended their
crystal from Magna,

11
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:55,666
who launched an all-out
solo attack. Then...

12
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,375
Seems you're forgetting
about this dashing mage!

13
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:00,000
[ASTA]
Yikes! Two against one?

14
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:01,875
Not good.

15
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:04,083
[NARRATOR] Asta's mysterious
teammate, Xerx,

16
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:05,791
came to his rescue.

17
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:09,708
Go after the flower
guy. Do it. Now!

18
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:11,708
This will only slow
me for a moment.

19
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:14,041
[ASTA]
That's all I need to beat you!

20
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:16,791
[KIRSCH yelps, grunts]

21
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:18,791
[NARRATOR] Mimosa deployed
a plant spell that stopped

22
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:21,166
Sol's golem in its
tracks, and Asta

23
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,291
and the rest of Team B
were able to claim victory.

24
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:28,208
And now, Finral and Langris
prepare to face off.

25
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:31,208
Who will win in this
battle of brothers?

26
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:08,666
[VANESSA chuckles]
That's much better.

27
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,750
Uh. Thank you, Vanessa.
That's great.

28
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,458
[ASTA]
Great? Try perfect!

29
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:15,083
You look awesome, Finral!

30
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:17,125
Yeah, you think you
could do mine next?

31
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:19,333
[VANESSA] Why would I
style a loser's hair?

32
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:22,125
You look fine to me. Like
the failure that you are.

33
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:24,791
Oh, yeah? Come over
here and say that!

34
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:26,166
Hey, take it easy, Magna.

35
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,166
Just try to stay calm.
Like a loser should.

36
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,416
Hey! You mess with me right now,
and I'm gonna kill you!

37
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,666
[LUCK laughs] Sounds like
someone's looking to spar.

38
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,625
Whoa! Whoa! It's not
the time, g--!

39
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:40,458
[yelps]

40
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:42,541
In spite of his rough
looks, that guy seems

41
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,750
like he knows his way
around flame magic.

42
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,958
The lightning mage
is skilled, as well.

43
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:48,625
[mumbling] Luck is
trying to cheer Magna up

44
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:50,458
because that's what friends do.

45
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:53,708
Hey there! You got any
more food, mister?

46
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:55,625
[HAMON] My goodness,
for someone your size,

47
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,208
you certainly can eat.

48
00:03:57,291 --> 00:04:01,875
[GAUCHE] Marie. Angel.
How I miss you, my darling!

49
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:03,125
[MAGIC KNIGHT 80A]
What's going on?

50
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:05,208
[MAGIC KNIGHT 80B]
It's just the Black Bulls.

51
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,541
[MAGIC KNIGHT 80A] Still the
same idiots they've always been.

52
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:09,208
Stop, this is embarrassing!

53
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,500
You're making all
of us look bad!

54
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:20,666
[VANESSA laughs] You're
lookin' a little stiff there.

55
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,916
Worried, huh?

56
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,875
About the match
and who you're facing.

57
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:28,291
Well, yeah. A little. I mean...

58
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:29,708
He might be my younger brother,

59
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:32,500
but I've never beaten
him at anything.

60
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,000
[VANESSA]
Don't worry.

61
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:36,666
I've fought alongside
you, so I know.

62
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:40,208
You changed after meeting
Asta. Just like I did.

63
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:42,291
Thanks to him, I was
finally able to face

64
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:45,750
something I'd hidden
deep inside my heart.

65
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:48,916
You're not going to lose
to him so easily anymore.

66
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,708
Go show 'em how awesome you are.

67
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,250
And I don't just mean the hair.

68
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,708
[gasps] Thanks, Vanessa.

69
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:56,541
She's right, you've
totally got this!

70
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:59,291
I wanna fight you, so don't
be a big loser like Magna.

71
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:01,291
Yeah! Don't be a
big loser like m--

72
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:03,166
That's it! I'm gonna kill you!

73
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,541
[laughs]

74
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:07,458
[GREY] We'll all be
rooting for you, Finral.

75
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,750
[mumbling] You can do it!
You can do it!

76
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,250
You had better not
blow this match

77
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:14,041
and embarrass the
rest of the squad.

78
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:17,541
Wow. You guys. Thank you all.

79
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:18,666
I don't know what to say.

80
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,708
I'm so happy I joined
the Black Bulls.

81
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:21,791
You're like a family--

82
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,333
Feed me, feed me,
feed me, feed me,

83
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:25,291
--feed me, feed me, feed me. Ah!
--[HAMON laughs]

84
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,583
Hurry up and win this.

85
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,666
I need to return to Marie
as soon as possible.

86
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,083
--Uh--
--[FINRAL] I'm your superior.

87
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:32,958
[ASTA] And I'm sure Captain
Yami's cheering you on

88
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,333
back at the hideout, too!

89
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:35,375
That's right.

90
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:37,166
His stomach wasn't feeling well,

91
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:40,041
or else I know he would've been
here to show his support.

92
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:41,125
Even so.

93
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:43,083
I'm sure he wants
you to work hard.

94
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:44,833
With or without him.

95
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:48,833
Heh. Those morons
are probably pushin'

96
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:50,833
past their limits right now.

97
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,416
Just like I'm about to.

98
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,125
This is the biggest dump
the world's ever seen.

99
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:56,291
Damn it, kid!

100
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:59,041
I told you to restock
the toilet paper!

101
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,416
Give up now.

102
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,500
You must know you stand
no chance of defeating me.

103
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:06,958
No, you're wrong.

104
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:09,625
Thanks to my friends, I'm
stronger than I used to be.

105
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:11,208
Our team will win.

106
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:13,166
We'll see about that, Brother.

107
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,708
Don't blame me if you get hurt.

108
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:18,541
If it's okay with you,
I'd like to handle him myself.

109
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,291
[HAMON]
Hm. Seems fine.

110
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:22,291
A battle between brothers.

111
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:23,875
I hope to test
my fighting prowess

112
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:25,583
against my own brother someday.

113
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:29,041
So, yes, I agree to your request
and wish you the best of luck.

114
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:32,708
Ha, ha! I'll ride the Sekke
Shooting Star to victory.

115
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:34,916
All shall remember
my performance.

116
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,833
Your team won't lay a finger
on our crystal in this match.

117
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:40,583
[yells] It's finally starting!

118
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:43,208
I can't help but
feel nervous for him.

119
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:44,875
[VANESSA]
You can win this, Finral.

120
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:46,333
I know you can.

121
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:49,250
And now, Team E,
comprised of Leopold,

122
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:50,625
Hamon, and Finral,

123
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:53,750
vs Langris, Fragil,
and Sekke of Team G.

124
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:56,125
Round two, match two, begin!

125
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,625
You guys concentrate on
destroying their crystal.

126
00:06:58,708 --> 00:06:59,791
[LEOPOLD]
We've got this.

127
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:02,458
First we need to
determine its location.

128
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:05,708
Now. Glass Magic:
<i>Verre Détection</i> .

129
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:10,750
[HAMON] The light will reflect
off the glass shards

130
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,750
scattered throughout
the battleground,

131
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:15,833
and every last inch of it
will be revealed to me.

132
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:18,375
This may take some time,
but rest assured,

133
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:21,791
I've no doubt I will find
the enemy's crystal.

134
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,416
Oh!

135
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:27,291
[SEKKE laughing]

136
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:29,041
I expect you to take
me all the way

137
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:30,958
to the enemy base
again, Mr. Ha, ha.

138
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:34,000
Leave it to me. And the
name's actually Sekke.

139
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:35,791
Please feel free to use it.

140
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:38,208
You can even call me
"Sek" for short, ha, ha!

141
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,166
Whatever you say, Mr. Ha, ha.

142
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:45,708
Ha, ha! No, I just told you.
It's Sekke. Sekke!

143
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:48,458
[LANGRIS] You brought shame
upon the House of Vaude.

144
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:51,208
There's no way I'll let
you defeat me today.

145
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:54,791
[FINRAL'S STEP MOTHER]
How could I possibly love you?

146
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:57,500
You aren't even my own
flesh and blood.

147
00:07:57,583 --> 00:08:01,875
My sweet little Langris
is the only child I need.

148
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:04,291
[laughs] Come now,
Mother, don't you think

149
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:06,791
it's a bit cruel
to put it so bluntly?

150
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:09,583
[FINRAL'S FATHER] What can
you accomplish with that?

151
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:13,541
Learn to attack, like Langris!

152
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:15,166
[FINRAL'S STEP MOTHER]
What do you know.

153
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:20,208
My Langris is both more athletic
and more intelligent than you.

154
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,541
[FINRAL'S STEP MOTHER laughs]

155
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:24,291
You're so amazing,
darling Langris.

156
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,708
As I should expect from
my own flesh and blood.

157
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:28,750
[FINRAL'S FATHER]
Unlike you, Finral.

158
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:32,125
You're a disgrace
to the Vaude name.

159
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:34,625
[LANGRIS]
How pathetic.

160
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:36,666
He's the older brother,
but there's not a single

161
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,416
thing he can do better than me.

162
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,500
[FINRAL]
What? A fiancée?

163
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:44,000
[FINRAL'S FATHER]
Yes. This is Lady Finnes.

164
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:47,000
She will marry the next head
of the House of Vaude.

165
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,958
[FINNES coughs]
Nice to meet you.

166
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:53,250
[FINRAL'S FATHER]
Her chronic illness keeps her

167
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:56,208
housebound mostly, but the
king is her great uncle,

168
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:58,333
so she comes from
a prestigious family,

169
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:00,458
and her magic is impressive.

170
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:04,291
[LANGRIS] Ugh. This is the
woman I'm going to marry?

171
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:07,958
Couldn't Father have
chosen someone less dull?

172
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:09,500
[FINRAL'S STEP MOTHER]
Now remember, dear.

173
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:12,208
Lady Finnes is going
to be your bride someday,

174
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:14,541
so you must try to
get along with her.

175
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:16,083
Of course!

176
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:22,583
[LANGRIS] Honestly. I don't
need a wife with a fancy title.

177
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:24,375
When I'm the lord of
this house, I'll bring more

178
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:27,250
honor to the Vaude family
than anyone has before.

179
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,708
Ugh. I'm so bored.

180
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,833
I'm very sorry.

181
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:36,000
I doubt many men would
choose to marry a woman

182
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:38,250
who's both sickly and
older than they are

183
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:40,000
I... I mean.

184
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:41,666
Any man would be lucky
to have a wife

185
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,708
as beautiful as you,
Lady Finnes.

186
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,000
[laughs]

187
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,166
It's just that

188
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,666
I'm not actually the
one who will become

189
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,250
the next head of House Vaude.

190
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:50,750
Huh?

191
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:52,916
I'm sure my younger brother
will make you happy, though.

192
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,500
He's better at
everything than I am.

193
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:58,958
His magic's amazing,
and he's really brave.

194
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,666
Compared to him,
I'm a total failure.

195
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:04,333
[LANGRIS]
Exactly.

196
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:06,666
At least he realizes
he's inferior to me in--

197
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,166
[FINNES]
No, you're wrong.

198
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,958
I know I've only met
you a few times,

199
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:12,458
but I can tell.

200
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:14,958
You're a very kind,
considerate person.

201
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:17,333
So, if you ask me,
you're a better mage

202
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,291
than your brother will ever be.

203
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:22,666
[gasps] Oh! You're
joking, of course.

204
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,666
Please don't tease me like that.

205
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:28,708
Don't be silly. I wasn't
teasing you at all.

206
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,916
[LANGRIS] Who does this
sparrow think she is?

207
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,958
Rating me lower
than that failure.

208
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:35,541
Utterly absurd.

209
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:39,125
He left the family because he
couldn't handle the pressure.

210
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,333
He's not better than
me at anything.

211
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:43,166
Not a single thing!

212
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,250
[SEKKE]
Ha, ha! We found it!

213
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,666
[laughs]

214
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,708
[ALL gasp]

215
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,583
Well, I hope you're
ready, Finral,

216
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:53,166
because here he comes.

217
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,583
Remember what I said.

218
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:57,166
Don't blame me if you
wind up losing a limb or two.

219
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,625
I'll end this in a single blow!

220
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:04,625
[gasps] What?

221
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:07,791
That's right. I tested
this earlier with Cob.

222
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:11,208
Something happens when
spatial magic spells clash.

223
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:13,166
The mana currents
within them collide,

224
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,541
causing them to cancel
each other out.

225
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:16,708
Just like that!

226
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:20,041
Langris, you won't
win this time!

227
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:32,041
That's so cool!

228
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:35,125
So two spatial magic spells
cancel each other out?

229
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:37,291
He didn't see that coming!

230
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:40,833
It's like Finral's a totally
different person out there!

231
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:43,333
Lose at this point
and I'll kill ya!

232
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:45,833
Hurry up and finish it.
Marie's waiting.

233
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:50,833
[slurps] I can almost taste
the victory cupcakes now!

234
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:53,375
Uh. Ha... ha?

235
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:56,458
[laughs] It looks like
we made a good choice,

236
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:57,958
letting you take him on.

237
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:00,458
Hamon, any luck yet?

238
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:03,833
[HAMON] Yes! I've finally
found the enemy's crystal.

239
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,875
It's hidden within that tower.

240
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,750
Right. Now, go. Quickly!

241
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:12,708
[gasps] They're gone! Ha, ha!

242
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:14,250
You've gotten too cocky,

243
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,416
but I'll put you
back in your place!

244
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:21,625
[LEOPOLD yells]

245
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:22,875
[gasps]

246
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:26,333
Step aside! We're gonna
destroy that crystal!

247
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:28,125
We'll see about that.

248
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,500
What's this?

249
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:35,875
Snow Magic: Phantom Snow Garden.

250
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:37,333
Do you feel it yet?

251
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:40,708
This spell both deadens your
senses and induces sleep.

252
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:41,875
While it's active, you won't

253
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:43,833
be able to attack
me effectively.

254
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:47,416
[grunting]

255
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,458
Yeah, right. I'm
not tired at all.

256
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:54,916
This is nothing compared to
my older sister's training.

257
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,500
Nothing.

258
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:59,166
[HAMON] Did you honestly think
that this would be enough?

259
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,875
Exactly! We can take
her, no problem.

260
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:05,625
I could eat five more helpings
and still have room left.

261
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:07,583
You're talking in your sleep?

262
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:09,166
[chuckles] Why fight it?

263
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,833
You look like you
can use the rest.

264
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,708
[LEOPOLD growls, yells]

265
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:15,958
[gasps] Those flames!

266
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:17,875
[LEOPOLD] I bear the
House Vermillion symbol

267
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:19,875
of an oath made to oneself.

268
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:23,458
I swore a vow that one day
I would surpass my brother.

269
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:26,583
So I'm not about to lose
to somebody like you.

270
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:28,583
There's no way!

271
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:31,000
Mana Skin!

272
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:35,083
Go Flame Magic: Spiral Flames!

273
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:36,625
[gasps]

274
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:39,958
[FRAGIL]
His senses are still sharp.

275
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:44,208
He managed to nullify my spell
by enveloping himself in mana.

276
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:47,750
[LEOPOLD] Stay strong.
Can't lose my concentration.

277
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:51,916
[gasps] I won't last much
longer. Hurry, Langris.

278
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,375
[SEKKE]
Ha, ha!

279
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:03,375
Ooh! A battle between two
adept spatial magic users!

280
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:05,875
You don't see one
of those every day.

281
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:08,333
Ah, so that's the Vaude boy

282
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:11,625
Finnes is going to
marry. He's talented.

283
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:13,458
Still no match for me, though.

284
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:16,000
Keep it up, Finral!
You've got him now!

285
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:17,500
You just have to hold out until

286
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:19,916
the other two destroy
the enemy's crystal.

287
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,458
Who knew?

288
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:24,583
I never imagined you had what
it took to stand against me.

289
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,000
Do you plan on playing defense

290
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:28,458
all by yourself until
your crystal breaks?

291
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,458
I'm not going to make it easy.

292
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:33,458
I'm sure you won't. That's fine.

293
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,541
Because I came
prepared to fight.

294
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:43,083
Ha, ha! You're an even bigger
idiot than I realized

295
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,791
if you think a sluggish
spell like that

296
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:47,166
could ever catch
my marvelous self.

297
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,583
[LANGRIS]
Incoming?

298
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:54,958
[SEKKE] That's an interesting
feature, but it's still no match

299
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:57,375
for my invincible
Sekke Magnum Cannonball!

300
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:58,708
[SEKKE laughs]

301
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:03,000
What? He just disappeared?

302
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:06,375
[sighs] Even I think
it's pitiful.

303
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:08,541
I trained like crazy,
but it didn't matter.

304
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:11,708
I never managed to learn
a single attack spell.

305
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:15,416
[LANGRIS]
Wait. It's not an attack spell?

306
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,833
That's Spatial Magic:
Fallen Angel's Wingbeat.

307
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:20,833
It follows the enemy,
makes contact,

308
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:23,541
then transports them
to another location.

309
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:26,625
It's a battlefield application
of the spell I usually use.

310
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:30,375
[gasps] He adapted a
basic spatial magic spell

311
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:32,958
so he can get rid of his
enemies without harming them.

312
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:36,041
Clearly this is a mage who
possesses a truly gentle soul.

313
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:38,791
I knew you could do more
than just flirt with girls!

314
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:39,958
He's gone.

315
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:42,416
I wonder where the
portal took him, though.

a matter of time

before my teammates
destroy your crystal.

II don't want to hurt
my own brother.

You're as annoying as
you are incompetent.

Who would've thought our special

be so similar?

[LANGRIS] How dare you force
me to use my grimoire's magic?

333

There isn't a single
thing you can beat me at,

and there never will be.

I must say, this is
quite unpleasant.

It's over, Brother.

His magic...

[FINRAL] I already knew I
didn't stand a chance against

345
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,125
a mage as strong as my brother,

346
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,125
but something else
is going on here.

347
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:26,083
Something strange.

348
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:28,500
I've felt magic
like this before.

349
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,208
[FINRAL]
Who are you?

350
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:33,833
Get outta there!

351
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:35,583
If that attack hits him...

352
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:37,500
Run, Finral!

353
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:45,166
[FINRAL] No. He's Langris.
He's my little brother.

354
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:48,875
You may not like it,
but we're similar.

355
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:52,333
So what if we come
from different mothers?

356
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:55,291
I never acted like
an older sibling should.

357
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:59,166
I left our family, and tried
to forget everything.

358
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:09,125
[FINRAL] But I couldn't.
No matter what you think...

359
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:11,083
No matter what
we've been through...

360
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:14,333
You're still my little brother.

361
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:18,500
[yells] Please, Langris,
stop this! Right now!

362
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:21,291
Or I don't know how much
longer you'll stay you.

363
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:22,625
Give me a break.

364
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:25,041
What could you possibly
understand about me?

365
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:27,291
You ran--abandoned your house.

366
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:28,500
You're a coward who can't even

367
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:34,458
attack somebody in battle!
You're nothing!

368
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:36,208
I'll stop you!

00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:41,541
[FINRAL, LANGRIS yell]

00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:04,416
Finral, no!

00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,750
Crystal destroyed. Team G wins.

372
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:14,541
[LANGRIS cackles]
There. Do you understand now?

373
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:18,333
You can never beat me.

374
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:19,875
Such different boys.

375
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:23,833
Young Master Finral's so kind,
and very popular, too.

376
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:25,708
Unlike his little brother.

377
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,291
You can tell that boy looks down

378
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:31,375
on everybody he talks to.
Such a shame.

379
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:37,416
Well, if you ask me,
you're a much better mage.

380

[LANGRIS] She seemed so kind.
But even she hates me.

Langris! You can take one day

382
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,208
off of studying, can't you?

383
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:50,250
Come goof off with
your big brother.

384

I'll be at the festival
if you wanna join me!

Why is he so nice to me?

386
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:57,666
Stop it.

Be more like Langris!

I'm better than he is.

That's why Mother and Father
are always kind to me.

391
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:08,125
I have to beat him
at everything.

392
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:13,083
Everything. Otherwise...
I'll... I'll...

See that?

He's goin' after the

Uh, I don't know.

You should try one of those

Or maybe Captain

For no particular
reason, of course.

[mumbling] Maybe something
a bit more mature?
