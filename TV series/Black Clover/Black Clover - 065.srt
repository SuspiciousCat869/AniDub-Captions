1
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:15,500
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:18,416
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:24,291
[NARRATOR] All seemed
lost until a lone mage

4
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:26,916
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,458
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:39,541
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,500
[QUEEN OF WITCHES]
Yes, my magic allows me

8
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:45,916
to manipulate blood as I please.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,750
Ever since I cast that
healing spell on you.

10
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:52,958
I've maintained total control
over your blood, as well.

11
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:55,500
And now for your first order.

12
00:00:55,583 --> 00:00:58,125
I want you to kill every
one of these weaklings

13
00:00:58,208 --> 00:01:00,000
with your own hands.

14
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:03,791
Do a perfect job,
and leave no one alive.

15
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:06,291
[NARRATOR] Under the control
of the Queen of Witches,

16
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:08,416
Asta tried to kill his friends.

17
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,833
Stop this! I'll make you a deal!

18
00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:13,458
[QUEEN OF WITCHES]
No. No matter where you run,

19
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:15,833
your ties to me
cannot be broken.

20
00:01:15,916 --> 00:01:20,333
You are my daughter, after all,
and family lasts forever.

21
00:01:20,416 --> 00:01:22,416
What do you mean by that?

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,083
[VANESSA] You're not my
family, and you never were!

23
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:30,875
'Cause the Black Bulls
are my family!

24
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:32,833
[NARRATOR] Vanessa's
fervent pleas on behalf

25
00:01:32,916 --> 00:01:35,916
of her companions
awakened a new power.

26
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:44,000
At last, the red thread of fate.

27
00:01:49,416 --> 00:01:52,333
[QUEEN OF WITCHES]
It dispelled Puppet's Blood?

28
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:55,083
[VANESSA] I can already tell,
it'll always side with me

29
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:56,833
and those I hold dear.

30
00:01:56,916 --> 00:02:01,541
Which means you and I
don't have any ties.

31
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:38,958
[VANESSA] Which means you
and I don't have any ties.

32
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:41,166
[QUEEN OF WITCHES]
This can't be!

33
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,208
[VANESSA]
Your Majesty, look!

34
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,666
I made a doll out of my thread!

35
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,291
Oh, my. You've
done a lovely job.

36
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:56,291
I want to use my magic power
to make other people happy!

37
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:57,625
Well, how sweet.

38
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,583
I'm sure you will, Vanessa.

39
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,666
[VANESSA giggles]

40
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,750
[QUEEN OF WITCHES laughs]

41
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:07,125
[QUEEN OF WITCHES] Somewhere
along the way in my quest

42
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:10,958
for absolute perfection,
it seems that I lost sight

43
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:13,791
of an extremely precious truth.

44
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:16,000
When one is imperfect,

45
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:18,458
there is a certain kind of
power that can be gathered

46
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:20,791
from one's emotions.

47
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:22,875
She could never have
learned that spell

48
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:24,750
during her time with me.

49
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:28,750
But now that she is free
to be her imperfect self...

50
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,625
...she's become perfect.

51
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:33,166
[VANESSA gasps]

52
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,375
[QUEEN OF WITCHES]
Do as you see fit.

53
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:38,750
It seems I must admit defeat.

54
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,375
[gasps]

55
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:43,125
Blood Recovery Magic:

56
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:45,958
Curse-Breaking
Blood-Filled Cocoon!

57

[ASTA yelps]

58
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:28,208
Hey. I'm all healed up!

59
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,875
What just happened?

60
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:38,416
[FINRAL] It must've taken
a lot of magic to do that.

61
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,375
The Queen really
is powerful, huh?

62
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:54,541
Did we... win?

63
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,125
[NOELLE]
You were so amazing, Vanessa!

64
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:05,291
[VANESSA]
U-Uh--

65
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:06,541
You did it!

66
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:09,250
Your new spell saved all of us!

67
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:13,708
Ooh!

68
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:14,833
I'm so relieved.

69
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,041
Oh, Zell. So am I!

70
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,708
You had me worried sick!

71
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:21,333
I don't know what I'd
do if I had lost you!

72
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:23,458
Hey, everything's okay!

73
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:25,583
Except that you're
half-naked again.

74
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:28,083
Oh. Wow. Guess so.

75
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,958
Long time, no see, you two.

76
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:32,916
Yeah, it's been a while.

77
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,875
Nice work, you little tiger!

78
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:43,541
All of this is thanks to you.

79
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:46,250
No, it isn't.

80
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:47,625
[NOELLE]
Huh?

81
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:50,625
It was everyone here.

82
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:54,875
My friends are the reason
I could use that spell.

83
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:56,750
Thank you all.

84
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,750
Guess you're right.

85
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:05,291
[gasps] Hey, wait. I think...

86
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:07,750
Yeah! The pain's like
100 percent gone.

87
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:09,375
My body feels even
better than it did

88
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:11,250
before this whole thing started!

89
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:12,500
That's our Asta.

90
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:15,000
Knock him down and he
just gets right back up!

91
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:18,375
And in case you haven't noticed,
you need to put a shirt on!

92
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,000
Crap, you're right!

93
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:22,125
Who does that remind you of?

94
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,166
I dunno.

95
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,250
Come on, Noelle, this is cool!

96
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:26,375
Now that I'm back to normal,

97
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,791
my muscles are way
bigger and stronger!

98
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:30,916
[yelps] Dummy!

99
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:35,500
[FINRAL, VANESSA laugh]

100
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,708
[QUEEN OF WITCHES]
This bird...

101
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:49,125
[WITCH 58C] I'm so happy all
those bad guys are gone now.

102
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:52,083
[WITCH 57E] They're gonna be in
big trouble if they come back!

103
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:58,250
[FANZELL] Apparently,
the Eye of the Midnight Sun

104
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:01,166
came here looking
for a magic stone.

105
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,541
Do you know where it might be?

106
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:07,333
The magic stone you speak of
is most likely this.

107
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:09,750
However, it's of no use to me.

108
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:12,208
You may take it.

109
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,250
Are you serious?

110
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:17,125
Thank you so much,
Your Majesty! Wow!

111
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:20,875
[FINRAL] No way! I was not
expecting it to be that easy!

112
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,333
Yami's gonna be thrilled
with us when we get back!

113
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:25,083
[ASTA]
Okay, so we know this is what

114
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:27,375
the Eye of the
Midnight Sun was after.

115
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,666
But do you know why
they would want it?

116
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,625
Who are those guys and what
are they trying to do?

117
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,500
Got any info?

118
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,666
That stone is a
type of magic item

119
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,916
that enhances the power of
the individual who wears it.

120
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,666
But only a member
of the Elf Tribe

121
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,416
is able to use it effectively.

122
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,458
Elf Tribe?

123
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:49,000
[QUEEN OF WITCHES]
They're quite gifted in magic.

124
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:52,541
Many centuries ago, their
kind resided in the place

125
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:55,333
that is now known as
the Forsaken Realm.

126
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:56,958
Every member of the Elf Tribe

127
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:59,583
was blessed with unbelievable
magical prowess--

128
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:03,500
some even had capabilities
that rivaled my own strength.

129
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:05,166
[FINRAL]
She was alive then?

130
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,000
So she's hundreds of years old?

131
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:09,000
She really takes
care of her skin!

132
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:10,791
Sadly,

133
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:14,291
they fell into war with the
humans, who outnumbered them,

134
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:17,333
and the elves were annihilated.

135
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:18,625
The Third Eye that appeared

136
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:21,166
on Fana's head before
she came to her senses

137
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,166
is a kind of forbidden magic.

138
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,375
However, Fana was not the one
who unleashed its power.

139
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:29,583
She was merely a vessel
controlled by another entity.

140
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:33,041
Forbidden magic is beyond
the reach of humans, you see.

141
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:36,000
[ASTA]
Okay, now you've lost me.

142
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:37,916
[QUEEN OF WITCHES]
The casting of a forbidden spell

143
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,208
requires extraordinary mana,

144
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:43,250
as well as some
sort of sacrifice.

145
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,416
For example, the ancient demon

146
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,625
was summoned with the highest
rank of forbidden magic

147
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:49,916
by the leader of the elves.

148
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,625
[GROUP gasps]

149
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:54,750
[gasps] You mean <i>that</i> demon?

150
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:59,208
This Midnight Sun
is a curious lot.

151
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:03,583
I wonder if they might be
descended from the Elf Tribe.

152
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:04,875
Hold on.

153
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:07,416
So the clan of evil
monsters in the storybook

154
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,291
my grandmother read to me...

155
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:12,625
Does this mean they were
the elves all along?

156
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:14,041
[FINRAL]
All this important information

157
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:16,416
is coming at us so fast,
I can't keep up!

158
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,583
If I don't take notes, I feel
like I might forget everything!

159
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:21,750
[QUEEN OF WITCHES]
Listen well, Asta.

160
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:24,333
The two weapons you carry
are all that remain

161
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,750
of the pair of magic
swords once wielded

162
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,625
by the leader of the Elf Tribe.

163
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:29,875
[gasps]

164
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:33,083
[ASTA]
I don't get it!

165
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,208
[FINRAL]
Yikes!

166
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:35,833
Looks like trying
to follow that story

167
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:37,250
made Asta's head explode!

168
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,458
Get it together, birdbrain!

169
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:42,750
[VANESSA] His feeble mind can't
handle much more of this!

170
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,583
Should you continue
to fight against

171
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:48,416
the Midnight Sun, you may
soon discover who they are.

172
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,333
[FINRAL] If he doesn't
short-circuit first.

173
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,708
[ASTA] So, I guess you
guys are gonna head back

174
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:58,541
to the Diamond Kingdom now.

175
00:10:58,625 --> 00:10:59,958
[MARS]
That's right.

176
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:02,208
The Queen of Witches used
her Puppet's Blood ability

177
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:04,791
to create this special
medicine for us.

178
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:07,875
If I give it to the king
disguised as a longevity potion,

179
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:11,166
I should be able to
thwart Morris's ambition.

180
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,583
That way,

181
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:16,041
I can reform the Diamond Kingdom
into a peaceful nation.

182
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,125
And I'll support
Marsy-boy in pullin' off

183
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:19,666
this master plan of his.

184
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,041
The only thing I've ever really
cared about is making it

185
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,291
to the top, and this seems
like it's the fastest way

186
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:25,833
to get there, right?

187
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:28,958
Uh. Are we sure about this guy?

188
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:31,958
[LADROS] I'll try and become
worthy of your approval.

189
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:36,000
And then I'll come back
and see ya, Teach.

190
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:38,416
We'll look out for Fana
while you're gone.

191
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:42,166
Be careful and try not to work
too hard, okay, you guys?

192
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,125
[DOMINANTE] If you need us,
we're here for you.

193
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,166
[MARIELLA] I'll make sure
he's not naked around her.

194
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,916
Or, I'll try at least.

195
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,333
Fana, please.
Will you wait for me?

196
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:52,833
I'm going to set
everything right.

197
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:54,958
Someday, the Diamond
Kingdom will be a place

198
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:56,708
that you can come home to.

199
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,625
I'll wait for as
long as I have to.

200
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:04,125
And once Diamond
is finally at peace,

201
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:07,250
you and I will see the
whole world together!

202
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:08,500
I'd like that.

203
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:10,500
Whoo-hoo!

204
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:12,625
Man, it's just not fair!

205
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:15,541
We'll be like that, too, Sister!

206
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:17,125
[MARS]
Asta.

207
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:20,166
I was glad when you said
that I was your friend.

208
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,000
If you're ever in trouble,
I promise you,

209
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,000
I'll be right there to help
you get out of it again,

210
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:25,625
no matter what.

211
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:29,458
[MARS] That's what
friends are for, right?

212
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:32,125
[ASTA] Yeah! And the
same goes for me, too.

213
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:34,458
Just say the word and I'll bust
into the Diamond Kingdom

214
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:36,041
and save you!

215
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:44,666
[QUEEN OF WITCHES]
You are free, my child.

216
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:45,916
[gasps]

217
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,916
But seeing as this
is still your home,

218
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,541
I would like you to
come back and visit

219
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:51,666
anytime your heart desires.

220
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,666
[gasps]

221
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:04,333
If you start off
in second place,

222
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,958
then the, uh, top'll be there
right in front of your nose!

223
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:08,791
[DOMINANTE] You'd better
focus on helping Mars

224
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:10,583
instead of just surpassing him!

225
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,833
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I know, I know!

226
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:14,625
[MARIELLA]
This guy's a lost cause.

227
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:16,750
Sorry I'm late!

228
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:18,375
Oh, hey, Vanessa!

229
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:20,875
[VANESSA] Are you guys all
done with your goodbyes?

230
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,875
Not to rush, but I'd
kind of like to get out

231
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:25,000
of this creepy forest.

232
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:28,041
Aw, rats! This place
is crawling with girls,

233
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:29,708
and I didn't get a single date!

234
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:31,041
[GROUP laughs]

235
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:33,458
[FINRAL] Hey, what are
you laughing at? Quit it!

236
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:36,125
[VANESSA]
Thank you for healing Asta.

237
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:39,166
I hope you and I
meet again someday.

238
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:47,083
[ASTA sobbing] Captain Yami!
My arms are all better!

239
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:49,583
I'm honestly surprised
we're not dead!

240
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:51,500
It's not that big of a deal.

241
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,458
Oh, glad you made it back.

242
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,750
Where'd your shirt go?

243
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,166
You're so chill! What gives?

244
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:00,000
Anyway, guess what?
We found a magic stone.

245
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:01,208
How cool is that?

246
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:03,541
[YAMI]
What? Listen, Asta!

247
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:05,458
Now that you're patched up,
your first mission

248
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:07,250
is getting us more supplies!

249
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:08,750
[ASTA]
Sir, yes, sir!

250
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:11,625
I'll grab everything we need
and be back here in a flash!

251
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:13,666
Wait a second, don't tell
me the rest of the team

252
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,250
is still out there.

253
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:16,375
[YAMI]
What, you think somebody's dead

254
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,083
in a ditch or somethin'?

255
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:19,458
Maybe?

256
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:21,208
Well, unless you wanna die, too,

257
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:24,000
I suggest you hurry up
and get shoppin' already!

258
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:26,208
[ASTA]
I'm on my way!

259
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,666
[door slams]

260
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:31,500
[VANESSA]
Captain?

261
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:34,333
Yeah, yeah. Welcome back.

262
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:38,833
Thanks a lot.

263
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,666
Hey, look what I bought!

264
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,708
That quick? Creepy.

265
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:53,208
[ASTA] Okay, boss.
What's my next mission?

266
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:57,666
Uh... Rest up.
You work too much.

267
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,541
No more missions for a while.

268
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:00,625
[yelps]

269
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:03,333
[YAMI]
And put a damn shirt on.

270
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:04,958
[ASTA]
Aw, come on!

271
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:08,625
If you take away my missions,
what will I have left?

272
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,125
Your muscles.

273
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:11,166
There, there.

274
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,000
Don't you think
you're overreacting?

275
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:14,666
Hey, when you're
done being dramatic,

276
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,791
I brought some clothes
for you to wear.

277
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,083
[MAGNA]
We're home!

278
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,583
Look at that,
they're still alive.

279
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:23,375
That was definitely
Magna's voice!

280
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:24,625
[ASTA]
Oh, right!

281
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:26,000
He and Luck went into a dungeon

282
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:28,000
looking for a way
to fix my arms!

283
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:30,291
I owe those guys
a huge thank-you!

284
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:38,041
[ASTA yelps] That musta
been a heck of a trip!

285
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:41,666
Our angel had lost his wings,

286
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:45,750
and so we went adventuring.
A risky thing!

287
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:48,333
Wandering in the darkness,
drowning in the loneliness--

288
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:50,666
the breaking of my
heart seemed endless.

289
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:54,000
Then a vision of you
came into view.

290
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:56,208
Feeling you near,
I let go of my fear

291
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:58,458
and found the courage
to push on through!

292
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:01,791
[ASTA]
This is way outta character!

293
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:03,583
The mana is calling.

294
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,416
[ASTA]
Not you, too!

295
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,083
As the journey grew longer,
my body grew stronger,

296
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:09,625
and on through the
dungeon we'd go,

297
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:11,166
knocking down each
and every foe.

298
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,166
Yet there was one secret
we did not know.

299
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,791
How could we hope
to salvage your arms,

300
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,000
that had suffered such harm?

301
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:17,750
By crushing regret
we were soon overcome,

302
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:20,541
and that's when we
knew we had to go home.

303
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,958
The mana is calling me!

304
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:25,250
But my arms are all
better now, you guys!

305
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:30,083
Well, that's great
news, ya jerk.

306
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:31,250
Why didn't you tell us?

307
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:32,375
Yeah, Thanks anyway.

308
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:33,833
Hey, good for you, Asta.

309
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:35,000
Why don't we spar a bit?

310
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:36,208
I'm good!

311
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:37,500
[GAUCHE]
We're back.

312
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:38,500
[gasps]

313
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,333
[ASTA]
It's Gauche! Oh, I forgot.

314
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,500
He and Gordon took a trip
to the Royal Library

315
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:44,375
to research a cure for my arms.

316
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,291
I'd better thank them, too!

317
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:51,708
[ASTA yelps] They turned
into a couple of nerds!

318
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:55,041
My eyes have opened at last
to the splendor of magic.

319
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:57,250
Every spell is a
grand work of art!

320
00:16:57,333 --> 00:17:00,083
Wouldn't you agree with me,
Professor Gordon?

321
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,833
[ASTA] What is happening
to these people?!

322
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:04,333
[mumbling] Yes, indeed,
Professor Gauche.

323
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:05,666
Magic really is supreme.

324
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,375
[ASTA] I still can't hear
anything this guy says.

325
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,250
But, as the key to
restoring Asta's arms

326
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:12,541
has yet to be discovered,
we simply must manufacture

327
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:14,166
some sort of
curse-canceling spell,

328
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,500
no matter how long it takes!

329
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:17,958
Just you wait, Asta,
we can make you whole again!

330
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:20,583
Don't worry about it,
I'm all good now!

331
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,750
[GAUCHE]
What is wrong with you?

332
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:26,958
I told you that I
would take care of it!

333
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:29,416
Go get cursed again
right now, or else!

Hey, are you okay there?
Your nose is bleeding!

336
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:37,000
Ah... That's because
you made me angry!

337
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:38,125
It's still goin'!

338
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,291
It's fine! Just shut up!

339
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:43,333
[GORDON mumbling]
Ah. I know.

340
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:45,208
Your nose bleeds when
you focus your thoughts

341
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:48,250
and energy on the happiness
of someone who's dear to you.

342
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,625
I realized this after
spending so much time

343
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:53,750
alone with you in the library.

344
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:56,125
Ah! I think I might've
just found the solution

345
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,625
to our problem!

346
00:17:57,708 --> 00:18:00,500
No! That's not going to work.

347
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:01,833
[GORDON mumbling]
It happens when thinking

348
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:03,416
of your little
sister, of course.

349
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,875
But you'd have secret nosebleeds

350
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,041
when you were thinking
of Asta, as well.

351
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:10,833
Ridiculous.

352
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:13,916
I need to look at
Marie for a moment.

353
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,083
[GORDON mumbling] Asta is as
dear to you as your sister.

354
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:18,583
And like your sister,
Asta is family to you.

355
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:21,958
Which means Asta's friend,
a term which refers to me,

356
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:24,916
in case that isn't clear,
is also family.

357
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,458
Yes. I understand perfectly.

And you're still eating?

Don't look at me!

This is so embarrassing!

367
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:52,166
[ASTA]
How is that embarrassing?

368
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:55,458
[ASTA] Charmy, you gotta stop
eatin' those nasty things!

369
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:57,666
I can't.

370
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,125
[ASTA] Every time you
eat one, three more pop up!

371
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,083
Want one? There's plenty.

372
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:04,333
[ASTA]
Hard pass!

373
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:06,916
Look! We picked up all
kinds of delicious goodies

for everyone to munch on!

375
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:11,333
So you risked your life
for some gross food?

376
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:14,083
[CHARMY] Yeah, but we didn't
find a way to fix your arms.

377
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,000
Sorry about that.

378
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:17,416

What a surprise.

Wait. What? Your
bandages are gone.

Does this mean you've
already been healed?

00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:23,416
How did that happen?
Oh, I'm so embarrassed!

382
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,500
Is there anything that
doesn't embarrass you?

383
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,208

we've got plenty of stuff

that workaholic musclehead

no one was around this morning,

Okay, what's next?

Captain Yami may have
ordered him to rest up,

[ASTA grumbles]

What's bothering you?

421
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:58,750
So, if that Salamander thing
was surrounded by flames,

422
00:22:58,833 --> 00:23:00,958
how come Fana didn't
get burned to a crisp?

423
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:02,833
Uh, because it's magic?

424
00:23:02,916 --> 00:23:04,875
Okay, and when we
use Sea Dragon's Lair

425
00:23:04,958 --> 00:23:07,666
to go underwater, how come
our clothes never get wet?

426
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,333
[NOELLE]
Again, it's magic.

427
00:23:09,416 --> 00:23:11,291
And if kelp grows
underwater, then how come

428
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:13,333
it doesn't turn the
ocean into broth?

429
00:23:13,416 --> 00:23:15,166
Leave all of the
culinary questions

430
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,958
to the brilliant
Professor Charmy!

431
00:23:17,041 --> 00:23:19,125
You see, the explanation
is quite elementary.

432
00:23:19,208 --> 00:23:20,916
Kelp possesses a component
within its cells known

433
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,583
as glutamic acid--that's the
stuff that produces the broth!

434
00:23:23,666 --> 00:23:24,958
Because of a
characteristic we call

435
00:23:25,041 --> 00:23:26,916
selective permeability,
kelp is able to take in only

436
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,291
the materials
necessary to survive

437
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:30,041
and excrete everything
that's extraneous.

438
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:31,916
And since the broth-producing
glutamic acid

439
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,291
helps to keep the kelp alive,
it remains inside the cells

440
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:36,416
until the organism eventually
dries up and dies.

441
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,166
When that happens,
the cell bursts open,

442
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,875
releasing the glutamic acid
and creating the broth!

443
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:43,791
Just say "it's magic"
and leave it at that.

[VANESSA] I'm sure the
