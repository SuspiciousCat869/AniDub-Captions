The Clover Kingdom.

00:00:24,264 --> 00:00:26,641
In this place where
magic is everything,

3
00:00:26,725 --> 00:00:29,602
there lives one boy
who was born without it.

4
00:00:29,686 --> 00:00:32,063
His name is Asta.

5
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,816
[NARRATOR]
His strength and determination

6
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:37,193
helped him become
a Magic Knight.

7
00:00:37,277 --> 00:00:39,863
And despite the many
challenges he faces,

8
00:00:39,946 --> 00:00:43,658
he aims for the top
and refuses to give up!

9
00:00:43,742 --> 00:00:45,326
Rich or poor,

10
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:47,412
royalty or commoner,

11
00:00:47,495 --> 00:00:50,290
Asta believes anyone can shine.

12
00:00:50,373 --> 00:00:53,376
His mission is to prove
that to the whole world

13
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,421
and to become the
next Wizard King!

14
00:00:59,841 --> 00:01:01,634
[NARRATOR] Asta and some
of the other Black Bulls

15
00:01:01,718 --> 00:01:03,553
were gathered up by Mereoleona,

16
00:01:03,636 --> 00:01:05,722
who escorted them
to the Yultim Volcano

17
00:01:05,805 --> 00:01:06,890
to increase their abilities

18

[NARRATOR]
Inside the treacherous volcano,

24
00:01:21,029 --> 00:01:24,115
Asta and friends discovered
a mysterious dungeon.

25
00:01:24,199 --> 00:01:25,992
This oughta be interesting.

[LEOPOLD grunts]

27
00:01:28,995 --> 00:01:31,206

[NARRATOR]
Leopold, who considers himself

29
00:01:33,124 --> 00:01:36,294
to be Asta's rival, showed great
strength and battle prowess

30
00:01:36,378 --> 00:01:37,921
when the group was attacked.

31
00:01:38,004 --> 00:01:41,466
Soon I shall master that spell
and become stronger than you!

32
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:44,386
Then I'll just have to
get stronger than you!

33
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:47,013
[NARRATOR] Thus, their
training came to an end.

34
00:01:47,097 --> 00:01:48,723
Or so they thought.

I wish you safe travels,

to take care of an urgent
matter of utmost importance.

41
00:02:04,406 --> 00:02:06,324
You should consider it an honor.

Hang on. I don't even
know where we are!

At my home, of course.

47
00:03:55,141 --> 00:03:57,519
I brought you to the
Vermillion residence.

[ASTA] Uh-- Mimosa and
her brother are here,

and Captain Fuegoleon, too!

50
00:04:02,399 --> 00:04:04,859
I see that you've been
summoned as well, Asta.

51
00:04:04,943 --> 00:04:07,028
I dunno if I'd
call it "summoned."

52
00:04:07,112 --> 00:04:08,988
More like "dragged here
against our will."

53
00:04:09,072 --> 00:04:10,907
You're as unsightly as ever.

54
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:14,744
And now you're a fugitive!
Even so, I have to admit:

55
00:04:14,828 --> 00:04:16,913
despite how it happened,
there was a touch of beauty

Uh, thank you?

Believe it or not,

59
00:04:21,668 --> 00:04:24,254
that was my idiot big brother's
idea of a compliment.

Is anyone gonna tell us
what we're doing here?

61

I have no idea.

But whatever it is,
it's serious!

Yeah, no kiddin'.

67
00:04:40,186 --> 00:04:41,688
Maybe we're here because
they need to give us

special orders for going to
battle with the Spade Kingdom.

whatever happens at this
table has the potential

to alter the course of the

Sorry, but I don't
think I'm familiar.

She's a nun at
the church in Nean.

I wonder what brings
her here, though.

[MEREOLEONA] The purpose of

Ms. Theresa's service
to the sisterhood.

I don't understand!

Didn't you guys just say
this meeting could affect

00:05:42,415 --> 00:05:44,000
the whole kingdom's future?

95
00:05:44,084 --> 00:05:45,835
Children are the future.

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,922
And Ms. Theresa takes care
of a group of children.

00:05:49,005 --> 00:05:51,049
I'm sorry, but I really don't
see how I could've been

98
00:05:51,132 --> 00:05:52,592
any more clear than that.

00:05:52,676 --> 00:05:55,345
I got a couple of ideas,
but hey, you're the boss.

Why exactly weren't we supposed
to tell anybody else about this?

101

It's not as though it's
some horrible secret.

102
00:06:01,267 --> 00:06:05,146
There simply isn't any reason
to tell anyone else about it.

103
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:08,983
Ms. Theresa hates the spotlight,
so we can't make this flashy.

00:06:09,067 --> 00:06:12,070
[ASTA] This is the worst
secret mission ever!

I don't want all
of this fanfare!

Can't a poor old woman
have some peace?

00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,830
So basically, we're just
here to throw her a party?

Any particular reason
you're hosting this?

in addition to being a member
of the Magic Knights,

112
00:06:29,587 --> 00:06:33,383
Ms. Theresa was also responsible
for educating my sister and me.

Oh, that's right,
I think I remember

that before, Sister!

for your heads getting bigger,

[FUEGOLEON]
After she finished tutoring us

121
00:06:49,607 --> 00:06:52,152
and left the Magic Knights,
she became a sister.

122
00:06:52,235 --> 00:06:55,280
And she's been with the church
for 15 years, as of today.

123
00:06:55,363 --> 00:06:56,698
Right, ma'am?

124
00:06:56,781 --> 00:06:58,825
I also heard about how
valiantly you fought

125
00:06:58,908 --> 00:07:00,910
to protect everyone during
the kidnapping incident

126
00:07:00,994 --> 00:07:02,704
that occurred in Nean.

127

Oh, yeah, you were awesome!
Especially for a granny!

128
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,752
Which is why we have
designated this day

129
00:07:08,835 --> 00:07:10,587
to be a time of celebration!

130
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,380

132
00:07:14,299 --> 00:07:15,675
And, since we needed more hosts

133
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,761
than just the two of us,
we brought you along.

134
00:07:17,844 --> 00:07:20,722
Okay, I think I see what
all this is all about! Yeah!

135
00:07:20,805 --> 00:07:23,266
You want us to help throw
her a super-fun party!

136
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,517
We can do that.

137
00:07:24,601 --> 00:07:25,727
Certainly!

138
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:27,228
Simply beautiful!

139
00:07:27,312 --> 00:07:29,689
Not your looks, obviously,
because you're a hideous hag,

140
00:07:29,773 --> 00:07:32,067
but your spirit
is simply gorgeous!

141
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,318
I'm learning to comprehend

142
00:07:33,401 --> 00:07:35,570
that non-physical
form of beauty.

143
00:07:35,653 --> 00:07:37,197
But of course,
my immaculate being

144
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,324
still outshines
all the rest!

145
00:07:39,407 --> 00:07:40,825
I know my brother's
a grown man,

146
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:42,535
but do you think you
could educate him, too?

147
00:07:42,619 --> 00:07:43,995
He's an idiot.

148
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:46,998
[ASTA] Wait a second.
Why isn't Leo here?

149
00:07:47,082 --> 00:07:48,083
It's a party for somebody

150
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:50,418
who's really important
to his siblings!

151
00:07:50,502 --> 00:07:53,338
Under normal circumstances,
I'd've summoned him here.

152
00:07:53,421 --> 00:07:55,340
However, he asked me
to let him use this time

153
00:07:55,423 --> 00:07:58,593
for some extra training,
so I was happy to oblige.

154
00:07:58,677 --> 00:08:01,346
[ASTA sighs]
That's a good reason!

He's got the right idea.

156

Too bad you two aren't
smart enough to realize

157
00:08:05,475 --> 00:08:06,851
what a waste this is.

00:08:06,935 --> 00:08:10,855
It's only for today, ma'am.
Please try to have fun.

[FUEGOLEON] By carefully
controlling my mana,

292
00:13:15,201 --> 00:13:17,579
I can prepare eggs to several
varieties of doneness

at the same time.

294
00:13:19,497 --> 00:13:20,749
The most challenging method

295
00:13:20,832 --> 00:13:23,001
is what's commonly known
as the "hot spring" style.

296
00:13:23,084 --> 00:13:24,878
The yolk of the egg
should be somewhat firm

297
00:13:24,961 --> 00:13:27,464
while the white part maintains
a gelatinous texture.

298
00:13:27,547 --> 00:13:28,631
Which means, for this work,

299
00:13:28,715 --> 00:13:30,133
I must adjust the
temperature to exactly--

00:14:11,716 --> 00:14:14,219
After all, your personalities
haven't changed in the slightest

317
00:14:14,302 --> 00:14:15,595
since you were children.

318
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:17,222
Could you tell us what
they were like then?

319
00:14:17,305 --> 00:14:19,099
Maybe a funny story
or somethin'?

320
00:14:19,182 --> 00:14:20,600
Show some respect, Asta!

321
00:14:20,684 --> 00:14:22,477
If I had to describe
them, I'd say that,

322
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,690
although they were capable,
they were still a real handful.

323
00:14:26,773 --> 00:14:28,733
[SISTER THERESA] I'll be your
tutor starting today.

324
00:14:28,817 --> 00:14:31,027
I look forward
to instructing you.

325
00:14:31,111 --> 00:14:32,612
I wanna do everything I can

326
00:14:32,696 --> 00:14:34,614
to make myself
stronger, Ms. Theresa!

327
00:14:34,698 --> 00:14:37,409
So please, give me the most
extreme training possible!

328
00:14:37,492 --> 00:14:39,536
You're being silly,
Little Fuego.

329
00:14:39,619 --> 00:14:42,455
It isn't possible to
become strong overnight.

330
00:14:42,539 --> 00:14:43,957
[SISTER THERESA]
He was unsatisfied with

331
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,584
the intensity of his lessons,
so he'd always sneak away

332
00:14:46,668 --> 00:14:49,879
and train on his own when
he was supposed to be in bed.

333
00:14:49,963 --> 00:14:51,589
But training too hard
in childhood

334
00:14:51,673 --> 00:14:54,134
can affect a person's
mana and development.

335
00:14:54,217 --> 00:14:56,970
So I tried to get
him to hold back.

336
00:14:57,053 --> 00:14:59,389
Mereo was always a wild child.

337
00:14:59,472 --> 00:15:02,434
She never listened to me
anyway, so I let her be,

338
00:15:02,517 --> 00:15:04,811
and she became a mighty warrior.

339
00:15:04,894 --> 00:15:06,646
I served as the
tutor to this pair

340
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,940
of troublemakers
for about a decade.

341
00:15:09,024 --> 00:15:11,985
At the end of my term,
Little Fuego was 15 years old

342
00:15:12,068 --> 00:15:14,070
and Mereo was 17.

343
00:15:14,154 --> 00:15:15,238
I apologize for being

344
00:15:15,321 --> 00:15:17,574
such a difficult
student, Ms. Theresa.

345
00:15:17,657 --> 00:15:20,326
You let me have lots of freedom
in my formative years,

346
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:23,038
which is why I'm as
powerful as I am today.

347
00:15:23,121 --> 00:15:25,331
So I'm very grateful to you.

348
00:15:25,415 --> 00:15:28,460
Well, that's kind of you,
but I was only doing my job.

349
00:15:28,543 --> 00:15:30,170
You must be a great teacher.

350
00:15:30,253 --> 00:15:32,088
Though I betcha they were
both super-good fighters

351
00:15:32,172 --> 00:15:33,256
even when they were little!

352
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,841
[SISTER THERESA]
Oh, hardly.

353
00:15:34,924 --> 00:15:37,635
Little Fuego had
terrible mana control.

354
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:41,097
Frankly, in his youth, the boy
was a walking fire hazard.

355
00:15:41,181 --> 00:15:42,390
[ALL gasp]

356
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:45,435
Yeah, I remember that.
You caused tons of fires.

357
00:15:45,518 --> 00:15:49,439
And you cried like
a baby every time.

358
00:15:49,522 --> 00:15:50,857
But do you remember the time

359
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,984
you worked yourself into
a tizzy when you were eight

360
00:15:53,068 --> 00:15:55,570
and accidentally set
your clothes on fire?

361
00:15:55,653 --> 00:15:56,946
U-Uh...

362
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:59,282
Now that you mention it,
I think I do recall that.

363
00:15:59,366 --> 00:16:01,576
Such fond memories,
aren't they, sister?

364
00:16:01,659 --> 00:16:02,702
Tch.

365
00:16:02,786 --> 00:16:04,329
These growing pains
are to be expected

366
00:16:04,412 --> 00:16:07,624
for children born with
extraordinary levels of mana.

367
00:16:07,707 --> 00:16:08,958
But with time and practice,

368
00:16:09,042 --> 00:16:10,752
their ability to
control their magic

369
00:16:10,835 --> 00:16:13,421
naturally grows in proportion
to their potential.

370
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:14,964
[NOELLE]
I get it!

371
00:16:15,048 --> 00:16:17,008
It makes sense that I couldn't
control my mana for so long.

372
00:16:17,092 --> 00:16:18,677
I was a late bloomer!

373
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,595
Then having poor mana
control's kinda like

374
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:22,472
wetting the bed! For most kids,

375
00:16:22,555 --> 00:16:24,391
it's not a problem after
about ten years old,

376
00:16:24,474 --> 00:16:26,267
but for some,
it keeps happening!

377
00:16:26,351 --> 00:16:28,895
Sometimes even untill
they're 13 or 14!

378
00:16:28,978 --> 00:16:30,146
[SISTER THERESA]
Yes, well put.

379
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,648
That's an excellent analogy.

380
00:16:31,731 --> 00:16:34,567
[ASTA] It really is a lot
like wetting the bed, huh?

I don't even know
what I did wrong!

383
00:16:39,322 --> 00:16:41,032
[SISTER THERESA]
I can hardly imagine anybody

384
00:16:41,116 --> 00:16:43,118
making it through childhood
without picking up

385
00:16:43,201 --> 00:16:46,371
a few embarrassing
memories along the way.

386
00:16:46,454 --> 00:16:48,581
Speaking of
embarrassing memories...

387
00:16:48,665 --> 00:16:50,458
One time, back when
we were little,

388
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:54,129
Fuegoleon broke a vase our
family had had for generations.

389
00:16:54,212 --> 00:16:56,381
I couldn't bear to see
my little brother punished,

390
00:16:56,464 --> 00:16:57,757
so I took the blame for it.

391
00:16:57,841 --> 00:16:59,843
Pardon me, dear sister.

392
00:16:59,926 --> 00:17:01,886
It's been many years,
and some of the details

may have passed
from your memory.

<i>You</i> were the one
who broke that vase,

and <i>I</i> who took the blame.

Ah. You certainly
sound convinced

that what you're saying is true.

398
00:17:10,854 --> 00:17:13,523
And it's not like it was
out of character for you.

399
00:17:13,606 --> 00:17:15,358
Right? It was the same thing

400
00:17:15,442 --> 00:17:18,737
after you pilfered that magic
item from Father and lost it.

You told everyone I'd taken it,
and they believed you.

That'll be enough out of you.

Did you make room in your memory
for these trifles by forgetting

404
00:17:26,327 --> 00:17:29,497
about all the times you swiped
food from me without permission?

because I never said anything?

00:20:18,249 --> 00:20:21,503
to all those fights
in an instant!

471
00:20:21,586 --> 00:20:23,088
Now, sit!

472
00:20:26,591 --> 00:20:27,759
How appalling.

473
00:20:27,842 --> 00:20:28,968
Of course siblings fight,

474
00:20:29,052 --> 00:20:31,012
but that was too
much by any measure!

475
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:33,348
I'm terribly sorry
for losing my composure

476
00:20:33,431 --> 00:20:34,766
with you like that, Brother.

477
00:20:34,849 --> 00:20:38,103
I had a less than
beautiful moment, too.

478
00:20:38,186 --> 00:20:39,521
And you two.

479
00:20:39,604 --> 00:20:43,066
Your behavior today has been
well beyond mortifying.

480
00:20:48,071 --> 00:20:49,322
[BOTH gasp]

481
00:20:49,406 --> 00:20:51,116
[BOTH yelp]

482
00:20:51,199 --> 00:20:53,201
[thud]

483
00:20:56,162 --> 00:20:58,456
[gasps]

484
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,708
You're in your 30s.

485
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,793
You have no excuse to be
squabbling hard enough

486
00:21:01,876 --> 00:21:03,003
to level your home!

487
00:21:03,086 --> 00:21:06,840
[BOTH]
We apologize most sincerely.

488
00:21:06,923 --> 00:21:09,634
[GAUCHE] Wait one damn
second, you old bag!

489
00:21:09,718 --> 00:21:11,136
What, are you just
going to stand there

490
00:21:11,219 --> 00:21:12,929
making that smug face at me?

491
00:21:13,013 --> 00:21:13,972
[SISTER THERESA]
Oh, there you are.

492
00:21:14,055 --> 00:21:15,932
I was wondering
where you'd landed.

493
00:21:16,016 --> 00:21:17,767
You wouldn't be in trouble
if you didn't come here

494
00:21:17,851 --> 00:21:20,353
without permission in the
first place, Big Brother.

495
00:21:20,437 --> 00:21:21,563
Marie!

496
00:21:21,646 --> 00:21:23,148
If nothing else,
the fact that your sister

497
00:21:23,231 --> 00:21:25,775
turned out so much smarter
than you is comforting.

498
00:21:25,859 --> 00:21:26,860
[GAUCHE growls]

499
00:21:26,943 --> 00:21:29,195
And you two did
excellent work as well.

500
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:31,573
Thank you so much for
looking out for the children.

501
00:21:31,656 --> 00:21:34,075
--Oh, right. Of course.
--[ASTA] Oh, yeah. Sure.

502
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,369
[SISTER THERESA] Now,
it's time we get on our way.

503
00:21:36,453 --> 00:21:38,371
[FUEGOLEON]
Ms. Theresa! Leaving so soon?

504
00:21:38,455 --> 00:21:40,957
[SISTER THERESA]
I've had plenty of your company.

505
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:42,125
I apologize again

506
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:44,377
for how we've
conducted ourselves.

507
00:21:44,461 --> 00:21:48,715
But please, let us make it up
to you by hosting you again.

508
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:49,716
I get the feeling

509
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:51,885
you haven't done
much entertaining.

510
00:21:51,968 --> 00:21:54,971
[MEREOLEONA]
Heh. Was it really that obvious?

511
00:21:55,055 --> 00:21:57,057
Indeed, but it's
still nice to know

512
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:00,060
that the two of you are
so eager to have me here.

513
00:22:00,143 --> 00:22:02,354
So let's see.

514
00:22:02,437 --> 00:22:04,022
My 100th year of service

515
00:22:04,105 --> 00:22:08,735
will be in 85 years, if you can
fit me into your schedule.

516
00:22:08,818 --> 00:22:11,905
That She-Leopard.
She's really tough, huh?

517
00:22:11,988 --> 00:22:14,115
[NOELLE] Seriously.
She could probably take out

518
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:15,283
a devil on her own.

519
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:20,246
[CHILDREN giggling, chattering]

520
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:22,332
[SISTER THERESA] You don't live
to be an old bag like me

521
00:22:22,415 --> 00:22:24,668
without picking up a few tricks.

522
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,011
[NOELLE]
Another mixer?

523
00:23:58,094 --> 00:24:00,430
Honestly, Finral,
what are you thinking?

524
00:24:00,513 --> 00:24:03,016
Next time on
<i>Black Clover</i> , Page 135:

525
00:24:03,099 --> 00:24:05,727
"The One Who Has My Heart,
My Mind, and Soul."

526
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:06,978
Stupid Asta.

527
00:24:07,062 --> 00:24:08,521
What do you mean
"the one who has my heart?"

528
00:24:08,605 --> 00:24:10,899
I'm royalty, you know! Jeez!
