enemy of the Clover Kingdom

10
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,125
of establishing their
own sovereign state.

11
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:51,916
They believed that
gathering the items

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,458
known as magic stones would
allow them to be reborn

in their "true forms,"
granting them great power.

However, they must still
collect three more

One of these stones was
in the Underwater Temple,

[ASTA, NOELLE]
Woo-hoo!

163
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:57,000
[NARRATOR] Asta and the other
Black Bulls were headed

164
00:07:57,083 --> 00:08:00,250
for the seaside
village of Raquey.

165
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:03,500
The strong mana in the area
kept it warm year round,

166
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,333
making it a popular vacation
destination for royalty,

167

nobility, and Magic
Knight squads alike.

been easier to use

to get there, Finral?

170

This is my first
visit to Raquey.

171
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:19,041
You should know by now
I can only use my magic

172
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:20,875
to go to places
I've been before.

174

00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,166
I figured you would have
made it your life's mission

where you were guaranteed

179

to find a bunch of

Hah. I've always found half
the pleasure of something

lies in the anticipation of it.

that growling noise?

And if that's Grey,

Did they all leave without me?

199

flying for a while now.

at it. See all that blue?

Wow, we're really here!

beautiful, Asta?

Indeed. It certainly
is, but, Sister.

beautiful as you.

she gave him, is he?

him or anything.

No, you need to go right!

[CHARMY]
I've got it. Almost there.

322
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:34,583
Just another ten steps!

323
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:39,708
[panting] Thought I was a goner!

324
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:42,541
Hey, uh, you know, this is new.

325
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:43,958
Gotcha!

326
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:45,958
[ASTA screams]

327
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:47,500
You can't just go
around hitting people

with sticks, Charmy!

If that had been anyone
else, they'd be dead now!

Oh, look. Watermelon juice.

[ASTA]
My head's not a watermelon!

Hello! Don't forget my swimsuit!

333
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,250
Hey, look!

334
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,458
Transforming into you
reminded me how gross

335
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:03,375
bein' all buff like this is.

336
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:04,958
You really gotta
find some serious

Gah! You're wasting it!

00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:10,875
[NOELLE]
About my swimsuit.

340
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:12,166
[ASTA]
Oh, hey!

341
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,458
Do you like it?

342
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:16,250
[ASTA yells]
I knew it!

343
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,041
This sand is awesome
for leg training!

344
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,083
Feel the burn! Yeah!

345
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,541
You will look at me
in my swimsuit!

346
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,500
And you're going
to do it right now!

[ASTA panting]

Jeez, you still haven't learned
how to control your magic yet?

--I mean, not that I'm...
--[LUCK] Aw, no fun.

It went out.

351
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,083
I don't have my
wand right now,

352
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:40,041
so local defensive spells
are the only ones I can cast.

353
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,750
You're bragging about that?

[SEKKE] Ha, ha! So this is
the famous Raquey beach.

359
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:59,000
I can hear the ocean
calling my name.

360
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,333
Is now really the
time to be relaxing?

Yeah, don't you have
work to do or somethin'?

362
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:06,833
[SEKKE] Well, I've just
accomplished so much lately.

363
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:11,083
The Wizard King personally
awarded me 100 stars. Ha, ha!

364
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:13,833
Even Captain Jack himself
praised my efforts.

365
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:16,000
Thanks to me, dozens
of innocent children

366
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:18,625
were rescued from an
evil traitor's clutches.

367
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:20,458
What's the harm in
taking a little break

368
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:22,041
to stop and smell the roses?

Well, hello there, ladies.

[BEACH BABES]
Home.

Home, huh?

374
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:31,625
Well, now that you're here,

Uh-- No, wait!
Hold on a second!

Some creep's prowling the beach
for unsuspecting girls.

378
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,833
Why don't you guys pick up
some ladies of your own?

379
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:43,500
What? With you?

380
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:46,291
Ha, ha. I could
never do something

381
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:49,833
as vulgar as that! No, I'll
simply meet back up with you

crash our party,

and act like he's the
one doing us a favor.

386
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,125
Remember, the only reason
you're here is because

387
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:02,875
you happen to have a friend
among the Magic Knights.

388

I've given you a killer
opportunity. Now, off you go.

So, we're doing this?

messin' around for?

Okay, you incompetent
knuckleheads, listen up.

While you were all
busy goofin' off,

426
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,583
I was out scorin' us some intel.

427
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:28,875
Apparently, the Underwater
Temple is beneath

428
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:31,791
the surface of the
ocean around here.

429
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:34,041
Unfortunately, the
mana-driven currents

430
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:36,750
are too strong,
so even a skilled mage

431
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:39,041
can't normally get near it.

432
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:41,291
The only time the mana
is weak enough to even

433
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:44,333
possibly access it
is during a full moon.

gonna kill ya.

If ya didn't guess already,

00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:58,000
the Underwater Temple
is on the ocean floor.

440
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:02,000
You need magic to
get there. So, Noelle.

[NOELLE]
But, sir...

446
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:12,291
I'd need exceptional
control over my magic

447
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:14,125
to manage something like that.

No, I can't do it!

on me, and I messed up...

[YAMI]
We die.

You blow this,
and that's it for us.

We get swallowed by
the current and drown.

This is a top-secret
mission the Wizard King

454
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:32,041
entrusted to the
Black Bulls alone.

455

There is no "someone else."

The full moon's a week away.

learn to control your magic.

[NOELLE]
Vanessa taught me some tricks

466
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:12,916
to control my magic,
but no matter

467
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,458
how many times I try,
it never seems to go very well.

468

I just don't have
the knack for it,

469

[NOELLE]
But that's no excuse.

It's no reason to run away.

00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,875

Please, I'm royalty.
We're just naturally perfect.

478
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:54,708
[ASTA] Hey, why don't
we train together?

479
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:55,916
[NOELLE]
Hm?

480
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,333
I can stop your spells
if they go crazy.

481
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:00,041
No one'll get hurt.

482
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,250
Yeah, right.

483
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:04,208
As if I would make a
mistake like that again.

484
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:07,250
[NOELLE]
Just the two of us. Training.

485
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:08,583
Well, fine.

486
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:10,291
If you insist,
I suppose training

487
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:12,583
with you wouldn't
be the absolute worst.

488
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:13,750
[gasps]

489
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:14,916
[NOELLE]
Hey, Asta?

490
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,291
[ASTA]
I hear something.

491
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:17,375
[NOELLE]
Huh?

492
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:27,458
[singing]

493
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:32,500
[singing]

494
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,333
[FULL CAST]
Clover Clips!

495
00:23:07,958 --> 00:23:09,541
[NOELLE]
"Look at Me!"

496
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:13,041
Hey, Dorksta, look at me.

497
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:15,041
Notice anything? Huh?

498
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:16,583
How do you like me
in a swimsuit?

499
00:23:16,666 --> 00:23:17,416
[ASTA]
Huh?

500
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,333
Well?

501
00:23:18,416 --> 00:23:21,333
[ASTA]
Uh...

502
00:23:21,416 --> 00:23:24,166
Wow. It's so sparkly!

503
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:28,166
Isn't it heavy? Bet you could
keep birds away with that.

504
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:33,041
[ASTA] Like this scarecrow
we had back in the village.

505
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:34,083
[NOELLE]
Hey!

506
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:35,791
What are you
looking at, you creep?!

507
00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:36,791
[CRAB 40A]
Crabbity!

508
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:39,541
[screams] But you
told me to look!

509
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:42,125
Well, stop it, Stupidsta.

510
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:44,458
[CRAB 40A]
Crabbity...

511
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:47,791
[SEKKE]
Ha, ha!

512
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:49,041
Did you enjoy
another installment

513
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:50,958
of Sekke's stunning exploits?

514
00:23:51,041 --> 00:23:54,541
I'm never more ha, ha than
when I ha, ha at the shore!

515
00:23:54,625 --> 00:23:57,750
<i>Black Clover</i> , Page 41:
"The Water Girl Grows Up"!

516
00:23:57,833 --> 00:24:00,458
One, two, three: Ha, ha!
