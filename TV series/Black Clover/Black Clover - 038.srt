00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:15,666
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,625
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:24,666
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,333
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:35,708
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:39,958
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

[ASTA grunts]

8
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:46,375
[ASTA]
So beautiful.

9
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:49,708
What is that? Where am I?

10
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:52,458
Am I... dead?

11
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:54,708
Hey, did I die?!

12
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:56,500
--[ASTA grunts]
--[MIMOSA] Oops! I'm sorry!

13
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:58,333
You're awake!

00:00:58,416 --> 00:01:00,625
Quit babbling like an idiot.

15
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:03,666
[YUNO]
Stop being dramatic.

16
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,750
Yuno? Noelle, Mimosa.

17
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:08,041
Sir Spectacles, you, too?

18
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:09,625
Well, we were worried about you.

19
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:11,958
I'm so glad you're
back with us, Asta.

20
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:14,416
I thought we were
going to lose you.

21
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,625
[yelps] Okay, that's it!

22
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:19,208
This hug's gone on long enough!

23
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:21,208
That's not gonna help me heal.

24
00:01:21,291 --> 00:01:23,541
I...

25
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:24,875
Hmph!

26
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:57,125
[ASTA]
What?!

27
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:59,041
I've seriously been
asleep for a whole day?

28
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:00,375
[NOELLE]
That's right.

29
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:02,583
And you had the nerve
to snore the entire time.

30
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:03,833
Loudly.

31
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:05,291
[KLAUS] That's the
exhaustion that comes from

32
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:07,625
fighting with
everything you have.

33
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:09,291
We wanted to help you as well,

34
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:10,666
but by the time we'd arrived,

35
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,125
the Eye of the Midnight
Sun had run away.

36
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:16,083
The word came awfully late.

37
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:18,541
At least we got to take
care of you afterwards,

38
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:20,708
even if we weren't able
to join the battle.

39
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:22,583
Your Recovery Magic
really helped.

40
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:23,666
Thank you!

41
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:27,916
[gasps] Oh, no.
It was nothing. Really.

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,041
Klaus actually did
most of the work.

43
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:32,333
He hardly ever left your side.

44
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:35,208
[KLAUS]
A-hem! Well, anyway.

45
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:37,000
Thanks to you,
the abducted children

46
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,125
all returned home safely.

47
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:40,458
And the one who took them--

48
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:41,750
Neige, I believe--

49
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:45,166
He's being questioned
back at HQ.

50
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,666
Although I doubt
he can tell us much

51
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,666
about the Eye of
the Midnight Sun.

52
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,916
Since he appears
genuinely remorseful

53
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,083
and has demonstrated
no malicious intent,

54
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,666
he'll be volunteering
here at the church

55
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,708
as restitution for his crimes.

56
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:58,375
Good! He felt so bad,
I was hoping

57
00:03:58,458 --> 00:03:59,750
it would be something like that.

58
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:01,833
[KLAUS] In any case,
you did a fine job yet again.

59
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:03,416
[YUNO]
If it were me,

60
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,291
I wouldn't have allowed the
enemy to escape so easily.

61
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:08,541
Yeah, well now I'm
gonna catch them.

62
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:11,375
Yuno! I'm not lettin' you
get the better of me!

63
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:12,750
You'll see.

64
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,291
I'm just gonna keep getting
stronger and stronger.

65
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,583
Then I guess I'll just have
to keep getting stronger

66
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:18,291
and stronger and stronger.

67
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:20,916
Then I'll just keep getting
stronger and stronger

68
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
and stronger and stronger!

69
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,291
I'll work hard until
someday I become...

70
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,083
[BOTH]
...the Wizard King!

71
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:30,291
Oh, just look at you two!

72
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:32,291
You're obviously
really good friends.

73
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:33,375
--[YUNO] What?
--[ASTA] Yeah.

74
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:34,791
Ridiculous.

75
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,291
Now that Asta's awake,
we should be on our way.

76
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:38,583
Yes, sir.

77
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:41,916
Oh, right, I almost forgot.

78
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,541
I meant to tell you,
Sister Theresa just woke up.

79
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:45,416
What?

80
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,083
Gauche is in there with her now.

81
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:49,833
Thought I might as well
pay you a visit

82
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:52,333
since you're conscious,
you useless old crone.

83
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:53,541
That's not the proper way

84
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,583
to speak to someone
on her sickbed.

85
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:58,208
Why don't you try that
again, you delinquent?

86
00:04:58,291 --> 00:04:59,833
[GAUCHE]
Why don't I just finish you off,

87
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:02,083
you half-dead old hag?

88
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:03,416
Go ahead.

89
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,541
You'll be right back in
prison the second you do,

90
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:08,083
you depraved ex-convict.

91
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,500
Hey! No fighting, big brother!

92
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:13,375
Of course, angel,
whatever you say.

93
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:16,708
Well, I suppose I can
bring myself to thank you

94
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:19,291
for taking care of Marie,
you withered old bat.

95
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,833
[SISTER THERESA] Hmph. So
you've matured just enough

96
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:24,541
to show gratitude when
it's warranted, then.

97
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:30,041
Also... I'm...

98
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,666
I'm glad you didn't die.

99
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,083
[gasps]

100
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,083
Is that right?

101
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:41,708
Well, my beautiful little angel.

102
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:45,291
Are you going to praise your
big brother for not fighting?

103
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:47,000
'Scuse me!

104

[MARIE, ASTA laugh]

106
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:58,125
You slept so long,
I thought you were dead.

107
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:00,083
I'm never gonna die!

108
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:02,083
Oh, yeah? We'll see about that.

109
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:04,208
Still got a ways to go.

110
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:06,875
Sister. Your wounds
healin' up all right?

111
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:09,833
Do I look like some
fragile old lady to you?

112
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:11,083
I'm fine.

113
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:13,208
I bet you're anxious
to tell Sister Lily

114
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:14,666
about your latest exploits.

115
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,000
She'll be thrilled to hear
the story, I'm sure.

116
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:19,500
You're right! She's
gonna be so excited.

117
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:22,208
Don't worry, Sister Lily.
Soon I'll be the Wizard King,

118
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:24,000
and then I'll come back for you!

119
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:25,291
[NOELLE]
Come on, Asta.

120
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:27,750
It's time for us to
be getting back, too.

121
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:30,416
Fine. But I gotta
make a stop first.

122
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,583
Huh?

123
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,583
Ah!

124
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:38,375
I'm so glad you like it.

125
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:39,833
I figured you'd wake up hungry,

126
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:41,750
so I wanted to have
plenty of food.

127
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:43,458
But I might've made too much.

128
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:46,458
[NOELLE] I hate to say it, but
this is really, really tasty.

129
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,333
Kill him. Kill him.

130
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:50,000
[MARIE]
Come on, big brother!

131
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:51,958
I've still got room left!

132

--[GAUCHE] Die. Die. Die.
--[ASTA] This is so good!

133
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,708
[NOELLE] So, maybe men
really do prefer women

134
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,708
who know how to cook.

135
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:01,041
[MARCO]
Asta! Thank you for the robe!

136
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:02,375
Sure!

137
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:03,875
You kept it all clean
like you promised, right?

138
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,000
Yep!

139
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:08,375
The robe may be clean,

140
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:10,583
but that's a lot more
than I can say for you.

141
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:14,750
It looks like you really
do need me around, after all.

142
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:16,208
[ASTA] But I'm a mess
even when you are...

143
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:18,916
[REBECCA] So she's the
girl he fights beside.

144
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,791
Well... I'm no match for her.

145
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:22,750
[ASTA]
Hey, it's okay.

146
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:23,583
[REBECCA]
Asta!

147
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:24,916
Huh?

148
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,625
[yelps]

149
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:33,000
[REBECCA] Sorry, but I'm
taking this much, at least.

150
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:36,625
If it weren't for you,

151
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:39,250
I might have lost Luca
and Marco. Thank you!

152
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:42,666
I, uh. Um. Yeah,
sure, no problem.

153
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,708
Just glad I could help.

154
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:45,375
Hey, wha...?

155
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:46,750
Did she just...?

156
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,875
No!

157
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:55,875

your lunch, there, L'il Rasta?

This time we're feasting
on pop-potato pies!

162
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:06,208
Right!

163
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:07,500
Can we start eating now?

164
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:08,958
I'm starving.

165
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:11,750
Is this actually a
Black Bulls tradition?

166
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:14,291
It's not. Hey, wanna spar?

167
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:17,000
I gotta make up for missing
out on the big fight.

168
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:18,125
It's only been half a day,

169
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:19,958
but it feels like
forever, Marie.

170
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,875
[mumbling] I wanted to throw
Asta a surprise party,

171
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:22,791
but nobody listened.

172
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:24,375
[GREY growls]

173
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,291
Sorry, think I'll have to pass.

174
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:29,125
I'd rather not end up
in a food coma.

175
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,583
[NOELLE]
I'm passing, too.

176
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:33,666
A competition like this is
hardly suitable for royalty.

177
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,583
You can't just say no!

178
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,875
This competition
is mandatory, folks.

179
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:41,125
Yami, sir! If you would kindly
judge the event? Thank you!

180
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:45,250
Fine, cut the chit-chat
and let's get started.

181
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:48,041
Ready. Eat!

182
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:52,500
It's so yummy!

183
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:56,541
My mouth is totally dry now.

184
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:01,958
I haven't even taken a bite yet,

185
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,375
so how come my stomach's
full already?

186
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:06,250
[YAMI] I see what you're
doin' there, Finral.

187
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:07,583
Stop usin' Spatial Magic

188
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:09,791
to send your food
into Luck's stomach.

189
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm busted.

190
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,375
Sir! I'm not very hungry.

191
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:14,916
If there were a pretty
woman to feed me...

192
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,791
[YAMI]
You're out!

193
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:18,291
Oh, yeah! Let's go!

194
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:23,041
Flame Magic:
Explosive Reheating!

195
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:29,250
[groans]

196
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:30,875
Thought it'd taste
better well-done,

197
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:33,375
but that's a bit much.

198
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:34,500
You're out, too.

199
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:37,416
I'm nowhere near full. Let's go!

200
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:40,583
Hi.

201
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:42,458
Jeez, Gordon! Don't sneak
up on people like that!

202
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:43,458
You're gonna make me choke!

203
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,625
[whispering] Don't
mind me, Asta.

204
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:45,708
You can keep on...

205
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:47,500
[YAMI]
That's kinda creepy, so, out.

206
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:50,291
[sighs] I won't have an appetite
until I see my precious...

207
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:53,166
[YAMI] And you two
aren't even eating. Out!

208
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:56,166
If I could just
have a sip of water.

209
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,125
[yelps]

210
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:02,125
Those losers over there
tapped out ages ago.

211
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:03,583
So who do we have left?

212
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:05,458
[CHARMY, ASTA munching]

213
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:07,333
[MAGNA] It's an Asta
and Charmy showdown!

214
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:12,375
[munching]

215
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,041
I'm not done yet!

216
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:19,625
I'll win this contest
without using magic!

217
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:22,333
Just wait and see!

218
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,458
[NARRATOR]
The results.

219
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:28,833
With no magic used,
the winner was Charmy!

220
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:31,125
Well, better luck
next time, kiddo.

221
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:34,916
[yells] But not using magic
is my whole identity!

222
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,083
[FINRAL, NOELLE, MAGNA]
Big surprise.

223
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:45,958
[ASTA] That crest! It's a
letter from the royal capital!

224
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:47,708
Did something happen?
Are we going?

225
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,958
Stop yappin' for
a second, will ya?

226
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:52,208
Yes, it's from the capital.

227
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:54,708
Looks like the Wizard King's
asking for you.

228
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,333
The Wizard King?

229
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:57,833
The squad captains
are getting together

230
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:01,125
for a meeting tomorrow,
says to drag you along, too.

231
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:03,625
[ASTA] Whoa! What's he
want me there for?

232
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:05,166
Like I know.

233
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:08,333
You're just gonna have to come
to the capital and find out.

234
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,041
[MARX]
Sir.

235
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,583
I've done as you asked.

236
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:17,125
The captains have been notified
about tomorrow's meeting.

237
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,583
[JULIUS]
Excellent, thank you.

238
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,083
As much as I don't
wanna believe it,

239
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:24,000
I can no longer deny that
there's a traitor in our midst

240
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,958
with ties to the Eye
of the Midnight Sun.

241
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:28,791
Tomorrow will be our
best opportunity

242
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:31,041
to find out who.

243
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,333
[MARX]
But...

244
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:35,208
Do you really think
it's going to work?

245
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:37,666
[JULIUS]
We'll know soon enough.

246
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,916
It all depends on Asta.

247
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:48,291
[MARX]
Thank you for waiting.

248
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:51,625
Welcome, Captain Yami Sukehiro
of the Black Bulls,

249
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:53,958
and Asta.

250
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:56,458
Sorry, um. What's your name?

251
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:58,166
Right, we've never
talked before.

252
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,375
I suppose I should have
introduced myself.

253
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:01,166
How rude.

254
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,583
This here's Mushroomhead.

255
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:04,833
Thank you, Captain.
I'm Mushroomhead--

256
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:07,625
That was both impolite
and uncalled for, sir!

257
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:09,875
My real name is Marx,
and it's my honor

258
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:11,958
to serve at the
Wizard King's side.

259
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,041
The Wizard King?

260
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:14,958
Wow, Mushroomhead,
that's amazing!

261
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:17,083
Well. It certainly
isn't dull anyway,

262
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:18,583
and your captain
was only joking.

263
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:20,583
My name is Marx,
not Mushroomhead.

264
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:23,041
It's been real fun chattin'
with ya, Mushroomhead.

265
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,708
Now where's the meeting?

266
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:27,833
My name is Marx, sir!

267
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:30,916
The preparations are going
to take a little bit longer.

268
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,916
Please wait with
the other captains.

269
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,583
Now, Asta, if you would
please come with me.

270
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:38,000
Huh?

271
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:42,083
[MARX] I understand you
had a particularly fine

272
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:43,416
showing the other day.

273
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,875
It's very rare for
the Wizard King

274
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:46,625
to give out ten stars at once.

275
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:50,833
No way! Ten whole stars?
That's awesome!

276
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:53,000
Uh, hey where are we, anyway?

277
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,916
[MARX]
A secret underground prison.

278
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,333
Hardly anyone in the
capital knows about it.

279
00:12:57,416 --> 00:13:00,083
It's where we keep
the VIPs, so to speak.

280
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:02,708
VIPs? Like who?

281
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:03,875
[MARX]
You've heard about the members

282
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:05,583
of the Eye of the
Midnight Sun captured

283
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:08,000
for their part in the
attack on the capital?

284
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:10,625
So you've been keeping
them down here?

285
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:12,000
[MARX]
Yes.

286
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,125
They've had memory-protecting
magic cast on them,

287
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:15,875
so we haven't been
able to get any intel

288
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,958
on their organization.

289
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:20,291
But the Wizard King has an idea.

290
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:22,125
He believes that
your anti-magic sword

291
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:25,583
might be able to break
the Protect spell.

292
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:28,208
That's why you're here.
Throughout the attack,

293
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:30,958
they always seemed to
anticipate our next move.

294
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:32,916
That wouldn't be possible
unless they were working

295
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,208
with somebody inside
the capital.

296
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:38,041
I'm afraid that the
only explanation

297
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:39,750
is that there's
a traitor among us,

298
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:42,875
and somebody who's fairly
high-ranked, at that.

299
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:45,708
A Magic Knight captain,
for instance.

300
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:48,416
What? Seriously?

301
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,625
We don't want to
believe it, either.

302
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:53,833
That's why we need to
make absolutely certain.

303
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,208
[MARX]
We're here.

304
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:58,500
[ASTA]
Right.

305
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:01,208
Hello?

306
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:02,833
Hi! Come on in, Asta.

307
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:05,041
That was some good
work the other day.

308
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:08,083
Thanks a lot, Wizard King, sir.
I'll try to keep it up.

309
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:10,375
I'm sorry. I know
you must be tired.

310
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:11,750
But you're the only
one who can use

311
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:14,083
that anti-magic sword, so...

312
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:15,375
Incidentally,

313
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:17,083
I heard you fought some
of the Midnight Sun's

314
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:18,791
strongest mages.

315
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:20,750
And about their
magic--was it cool?

316
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:23,750
Um. Yeah I guess so.

317
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:24,833
[JULIUS]
Copy Magic?

318
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:26,833
It just copies another
mage's spell?

319
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:28,666
Simply amazing!

320
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,958
Ooh, and Beast Magic?

321
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:31,541
I've never even heard
of that before!

322
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:33,000
And Spirit Magic?

323
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:36,416
Flame Spirit Magic?
How marvelous!

324
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,416
I wish I could have been there!

325
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,666
Uh, sorry?

326
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,875
Sir. Calm yourself!

327
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:43,833
Uh. Right, sorry.

328
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,291
You've heard our plan, Asta.

329
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:48,000
I think it just
might work. Do you?

330
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:49,125
Absolutely.

331
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,083
Whatever you need,
I'm at your service!

332
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:52,333
Yay!

333
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:54,791
What'd they bring this
little brat here for?

334
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:59,208
You'll see. That's the kid
who uses anti-magic.

335
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:01,666
They'll have him try to
dispel the Protect magic

336
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:02,958
cast on our memories.

337
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:04,041
[gasps]

338
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:05,958
[ASTA chuckles]

339
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:07,291
[CATHERINE]
No, don't!

340
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:08,916
Keep that thing away
from us, you swine!

341
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,416
[ASTA]
Hai-yah!

342
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,500
Dink. Donk.

343
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:15,583
All right, Marx, it's your turn.

344
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:16,666
Sir!

345
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:20,500
Memory Exchange Magic:
Mémoire Absolue!

346
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:25,000
What's it doing?

347
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:26,958
[MARX] This spell lets us
communicate directly

348
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:29,083
with their minds,
allowing us to hear only

349
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:30,958
their truthful memories.

350
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:33,500
Which means they can't hide.

351
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:34,291
Whoa!

352
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:35,625
Yeah, amazing, right?

353
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:37,291
Poking around in people's
heads like that!

354
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:38,166
It's so cool!

355
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,416
Sure.

356
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,541
If you don't mind,
I'm trying to concentrate.

357
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:42,958
[BOTH]
'Kay.

358
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:46,375
[MARX] I'm going to ask
you some questions.

359
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:48,458
You are to answer them honestly.

360
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,375
Understood?

361
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,125
[BOTH]
Yes, sir.

362
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,958
I heard all about your little
rumble in Nean Village.

363
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,458
Four Magic Knight captains

364
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:03,500
and you let a terrorist
ring leader get away?

365
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,000
How embarrassing.

366
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:08,583
[cackles] They were a little
tougher than those nobodies

367
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:09,958
from the Diamond
and Spade Kingdoms

368
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:11,875
you and your squad
went up against.

369
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:13,750
We were in a real battle.

370
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:16,000
[GUELDRE chuckles]
That's awfully big talk

371
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:18,750
coming from a man whose squad
has fewer stars than mine.

372
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:21,416
[JACK cackles]
Only because we don't stoop

373
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,250
to doing sneaky
stuff on the sly.

374
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:24,875
[GUELDRE, JACK laugh]

375
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:28,666
[YAMI laughs] I don't know
about this new katana.

376
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,500
Just doesn't shine the same.

377
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:32,375
And with the ten-year payment
plan they have me on,

378
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,666
I'm gonna be in
debt for a while.

379
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:37,541
Anyway, you need to calm down,
Skinnybones Lineface.

380
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:39,208
Garbletron's actually
got a point.

381
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:40,458
It's Gueldre!

382
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,541
Like I'm interested in
the opinion of somebody

383
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:44,041
who doesn't have
any stars at all.

384
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:47,291
[YAMI] Hm? We got plenty
of stars--black ones.

385
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:50,250
[JACK] You really want to brag
about having negative stars?

386
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:51,916
Will you two be silent?

387
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,500
Foreigners and low-born fools
should hold their tongues.

388
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:55,583
[YAMI]
What's that?

389
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,625
You wanna join our crew,
Sir Stuffypants?

390
00:16:57,708 --> 00:16:59,166
This is absurd.

391
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,041
We'll never accomplish anything.

392
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:03,458
Not with all these
men blathering on.

393
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:05,833
[CHARLOTTE] And why do I
have to be next to Yami?

394
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:07,083
Calm down, Charlotte.

395
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:10,250
Don't panic. Just be yourself.

396
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:12,708
[chuckles] We still need
an interim captain

397
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:14,208
for the Crimson Lion Kings.

398
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,333
Whoever it is will have
big shoes to fill.

399
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:17,833
If Fuegoleon were here,
he would've had

400
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:19,166
everything settled five minutes

401
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,083
after he walked
through the door.

402
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:23,625
[gasps]

403
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:25,375
[RILL]
Why's everyone so gloomy?

404
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:29,125
Some youthful charm
should lighten the mood!

405
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:31,208
Check it out, you guys!

406
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:34,041
I'm Captain
Fuegoleon Vermillion.

407
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:36,291
What exactly do you
think you're doing?

408
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,375
You may have become
a captain at a young age,

409
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,500
but you still need
to show some respect.

410
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:41,583
[RILL]
Aw.

411
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:45,666
[YAMI laughs]
You're a funny one, kid.

412
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,416
[WILLIAM]
I've kept you all waiting.

413
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,750
I apologize for my tardiness.

414
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:53,333
What were you doing, Vangeance?

415
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:56,625
[WILLIAM] Oh. Something
needed my attention.

416
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,041
[GUELDRE]
Heh. You're busy.

417
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:00,041
And who would expect
it to be otherwise?

418
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:02,541
The charismatic captain with
the most stars to his name

419
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:04,958
this term must have a lot to do.

420
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:07,000
So tell me, what is your secret?

421
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:09,041
How did the Golden Dawn
come to be the mightiest

422
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:12,500
of all the Magic Knight Squads,
and in record time, at that?

423
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:14,250
I hear every member
of your squad

424
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:15,625
is developing greater talents

425
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:17,583
than would have been
expected of them.

426
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:19,333
Do you perhaps have
magic that allows you

427
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:21,458
to see into someone's future?

428
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:24,250
Regrettably, I can
claim no such power.

429
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:27,500
The members of the Golden Dawn
are simply diligent workers.

430
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:29,000
As a matter of fact,

431
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:31,500
I've wanted to ask you,
the mighty tycoon,

432
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,125
the secret to
amassing a fortune.

433
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:36,791
[GUELDRE chuckles] That's a
trade secret, I'm afraid.

434
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:39,541
There's somethin' I've
noticed for a while now.

435
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:42,541
You've got one hell
of a creepy laugh.

436
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:45,291
And you thought today's meeting
would be a good time to tell me?

437
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:48,791
Also, it's scary how much
you look like a boneless ham.

438
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,791
Tell me, Vangeance.

439
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:51,958
What were you doing on the day

440
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:54,750
of the Distinguished
Service Ceremony?

441
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,625
When a captain has knights
who are taking part

442
00:18:56,708 --> 00:19:00,625
in the ceremony, that captain
should also be in attendance.

443
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:02,041
Perhaps there was
something that needed

444
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,958
your attention that day, too.

445
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:05,250
Well?

446
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,333
I was playin' the
gentleman's game of chance.

447
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:09,916
Got cleaned out,
too. You get it.

448
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,541
[NOZEL]
Nobody asked.

449
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
[RILL]
The mood's slipping again.

450
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,166
I know!

451
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,708
And as for you.

452
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,625
If you intend to impersonate
me, then be prepared.

453
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:24,708
There will be consequences.

454
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:27,500
[gasps] I can't do it!

455
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:31,625
Turns out those braided bangs
are really tough to pull off.

456
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:35,541
[YAMI laughs] You are
seriously killin' me, kid.

457
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:38,291
Now stop givin' Goldie
here such a hard time.

458
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:39,500
Oh, and hey.

459
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:43,583
You don't happen to use
Light Magic, do ya?

460
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:45,291
No, I don't.

461
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:51,833
[RILL] Oh, man, it just
keeps getting worse.

462
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:53,833
[RILL]
Hey, check this out!

463
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:55,416
Hi, I'm Yami!

464
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,666
Okay!

465
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,250
Now you keep your darn
mouth shut, chuckles!

466
00:19:58,333 --> 00:19:59,583
[RILL]
What?

467
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,416
I bet you were babied
a lot growing up,

468
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,416
but I'm not gonna
do that, got it?

469
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,500
Time to start acting
like a squad captain.

470
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:08,166
[RILL] I don't get it.
He was laughing a second ago.

471
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,333
And you!

472
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,458
Would you quit sleepin'
all the damn time?

473
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:13,291
Oh, okay, what is this?

474
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:15,208
Yo--okay, you're talking
with your snores?

475
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:18,166
Well, I have no idea
what you're saying! Gah!

476
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,666
And where the hell is Julius?

477
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,666
He's the one who called this
meeting in the first place!

478
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,500
Don't tell me he forgot
about dragging us all

479
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:28,291
down here today and went
runnin' off somewhere.

480
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:30,208
[CAPTAINS]
It could happen.

481
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:32,416
Thank you for waiting
patiently, everyone.

482
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,041
The preparations are
complete, however,

483
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:36,541
the captains' meeting will
be taking place elsewhere.

484
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:39,375
Get your ass over
here, Mushroomhead!

485
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:41,250
[MARX]
He is really mad!

486
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:49,458
So this is where
they stashed ya.

487
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,458
You doin' okay?

488
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:52,750
Yes, sir.

489
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:54,916
I'm doing fine, thank you
so much for asking.

490
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,166
Does he need to take
a dump or somethin'?

491
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,583
Excuse me, sir.
What is this about?

492
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:05,625
[CHARLOTTE] Those two.
They're from the Midnight Sun.

493
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:07,166
Have you learned
something from them?

494
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,000
Oh, yes, all kinds of things.

495
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:12,000
Thanks to Marx and Asta,
they've become very talkative.

496
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:14,958
But the juiciest tidbit
is probably this:

497
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:18,125
It seems...

498
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:22,583
One of you has been working with
the Eye of the Midnight Sun

499
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,750

501
00:23:04,125 --> 00:23:06,166
Go, Mémoire Absolue!

502
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,541
Uh...

503
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:14,125
All right, I'm going to ask
you some questions now.

504
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:15,125
Answer them honestly.

505
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:16,208
Yes, sir.

506
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:17,791
If you had to be
either the Wizard King

507
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:20,500
or a magic geek, then which
of them would you choose?

508
00:23:20,583 --> 00:23:21,666
Magic geek for sure.

509
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:24,291
I knew it! Okay then.

510
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:27,333
Next question: what do
you think about me?

511
00:23:27,416 --> 00:23:29,125
Well, you can be
a henpecking nag

512
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:31,166
some of the time,
but you're a hard worker,

513
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,333
and I'm always grateful for you.

514
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:35,500
[gasps]

515
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:36,583
Do you mean that?

516
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:38,000
Of course I do.

517
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,791
You're why I can rush through
my Wizard King duties

518
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:42,083
and focus on being a magic geek.

519
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:45,625
[yelps, groans]

520
00:23:46,666 --> 00:23:48,791
[ASTA] There's a traitor
in this dungeon?

521
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:50,791
But the Magic Knights
are supposed to be people

522
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:53,125
everyone in the
Clover Kingdom can trust.

523
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:55,375
Whoever you are, I'm
gonna teach you a lesson!
