1
00:00:22,554 --> 00:00:25,807
[NARRATOR] Within the clover's
fifth leaf, there lives a devil.

2
00:00:27,225 --> 00:00:29,686
[NARRATOR] Asta, born
unable to harness mana,

3
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:31,479
was granted the power
of Anti-magic

4
00:00:31,563 --> 00:00:33,231
from his five-leaf grimoire,

5
00:00:33,314 --> 00:00:37,027
giving him the ability
to nullify spells.

6
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,738
Unfortunately, the members
of Spade Kingdom's

7
00:00:39,821 --> 00:00:42,407
Dark Triad also possess
powers from the devils

8
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:44,659
of the underworld and
used them to launch

9
00:00:44,743 --> 00:00:47,662
an invasion on the
neighboring countries.

10
00:00:47,746 --> 00:00:49,706
Gaining strength from
his belief in himself

11
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:51,750
and from the support
of his friends,

12
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:55,086
Asta continues to fight for
the safety of this world.

13
00:02:36,688 --> 00:02:38,815
[OWEN] While you were defending
your own headquarters,

14
00:02:38,898 --> 00:02:41,651
the Golden Dawn's base
was attacked, as well.

15
00:02:41,735 --> 00:02:43,611
They were almost wiped out.

16
00:02:47,282 --> 00:02:48,867
I can't tell you
how relieved I am

17
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,869
to see you all survived.

18
00:02:52,912 --> 00:02:57,125
That's because Asta
and Yami were around.

19
00:02:59,627 --> 00:03:01,546
So, how bad is it?

20
00:03:01,629 --> 00:03:04,257
He should pull
through, fortunately.

21
00:03:04,341 --> 00:03:08,678
But... I'm not sure what we
can do for his right arm.

22
00:03:08,762 --> 00:03:10,930
There's no telling
what'll come of it.

23
00:03:12,932 --> 00:03:14,351
Excuse me!

24
00:03:14,434 --> 00:03:16,853
But would you mind taking
a look at Gauche, too, please?

25
00:03:16,936 --> 00:03:18,480
Was he injured as well?

26
00:03:18,563 --> 00:03:21,483
The wound's all healed.
I feel fine now.

27
00:03:21,566 --> 00:03:23,401
You should still let him
make sure, though!

28
00:03:23,485 --> 00:03:24,861
Just in case!

29
00:03:24,944 --> 00:03:26,196
[OWEN]
What do you mean?

30
00:03:26,279 --> 00:03:27,906
Gauche was hit with
an enormous sword

31
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:29,741
that went right
through him, sir!

32
00:03:29,824 --> 00:03:32,994
I used a spell to heal him
as fast as I could, but...

33
00:03:33,078 --> 00:03:34,287
[OWEN]
I don't understand.

34
00:03:34,371 --> 00:03:37,415
I thought you were a
Transformation Magic user.

35
00:03:40,627 --> 00:03:43,046
Don't worry, Grey.
I'll take a look.

36
00:03:47,008 --> 00:03:49,302
Wait. I'm sorry, did she say

37
00:03:49,386 --> 00:03:51,721
the sword went all the way
through your body?

38
00:03:51,805 --> 00:03:53,056
[GAUCHE]
Yeah.

39
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:54,891
[OWEN]
This goes beyond healing.

40
00:03:54,974 --> 00:03:58,103
It looks as though the tissue's
been completely rebuilt!

41
00:03:58,186 --> 00:03:59,104
[BOTH gasp]

42
00:03:59,187 --> 00:04:01,439
Perhaps at the
core of your magic,

43
00:04:01,523 --> 00:04:04,901
it's something much more
than Transformation.

44
00:04:04,984 --> 00:04:07,070
Then what kind of magic is it?

45
00:04:07,153 --> 00:04:11,116
I wish I could be of more help,
but I honestly have no idea.

46
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,784
I believe this is
something that Grey

47
00:04:12,867 --> 00:04:15,036
needs to figure out for herself.

48
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,038
Yes, sir.

49
00:04:17,122 --> 00:04:19,082
[OWEN] I'd like Asta
to stay here for a while

50
00:04:19,165 --> 00:04:20,834
so that I can monitor him.

51
00:04:20,917 --> 00:04:24,254
The rest of you can return
to the Black Bulls hideout.

52
00:04:24,337 --> 00:04:25,588
The Squad Captains are holding

53
00:04:25,672 --> 00:04:27,924
an emergency meeting
tomorrow morning.

54
00:04:28,008 --> 00:04:30,593
The best thing you can do
is get some rest,

55
00:04:30,677 --> 00:04:33,513
so you can be ready
for whatever comes next.

56
00:04:39,728 --> 00:04:41,438
[ASTA gasps]

57
00:04:41,521 --> 00:04:46,776
[pants]

58
00:05:09,716 --> 00:05:13,011
[ASTA]
Huh? I can't move my body!

59
00:05:15,764 --> 00:05:18,350
Are you going somewhere?

60
00:05:18,433 --> 00:05:19,726
[ASTA]
Who is that?

61
00:05:19,809 --> 00:05:21,936
Is he using magic
to hold me still?

62
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,897
You should go back inside now.

63
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:27,359
They took the captain.
I have to save him!

64
00:05:27,442 --> 00:05:29,819
That won't work.

65
00:05:29,903 --> 00:05:31,905
You'd be walking into
a fight against not only

66
00:05:31,988 --> 00:05:34,741
the devil-possessed man
who defeated you before,

67
00:05:34,824 --> 00:05:37,369
but two others who
are equally powerful.

68
00:05:37,452 --> 00:05:40,330
Believe me, you don't
stand a chance.

69
00:05:41,748 --> 00:05:44,542
[NACHT] On top of that,
your own devil's forsaken you

70
00:05:44,626 --> 00:05:47,879
and you aren't sure what'll
happen to your right arm.

71
00:05:47,962 --> 00:05:50,590
[ASTA]
How does he know that?

72
00:05:50,674 --> 00:05:53,259
[NACHT] Challenging them in
your condition isn't brave.

73
00:05:53,343 --> 00:05:55,929
In fact, it's foolish
and reckless.

74
00:05:56,012 --> 00:05:58,848
I don't care.
I still have to go!

75
00:05:58,932 --> 00:06:01,685
How could I just sit
around here and do nothing

76
00:06:01,768 --> 00:06:05,021
when he's in trouble?
When he needs my help?

77
00:06:05,105 --> 00:06:09,359
[NACHT] You might as well leave
that boorish brute to die.

78
00:06:09,442 --> 00:06:11,486
Whoever you are,
shut your mouth,

79
00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:14,906
because you don't know the first
thing about Captain Yami!

80
00:06:14,989 --> 00:06:16,950
Oh, I know him quite well.

81
00:06:18,493 --> 00:06:20,870
[NACHT]
He's a violent and vicious man,

82
00:06:20,954 --> 00:06:24,666
not to mention he's
irresponsible and brash.

83
00:06:24,749 --> 00:06:26,876
To tell the truth,
he's worthless.

84
00:06:39,014 --> 00:06:41,683
I'm gonna need backup over here.

85
00:06:41,766 --> 00:06:43,101
Asta!

86
00:06:44,769 --> 00:06:47,230
You don't know him.
You've got no idea!

87
00:06:47,313 --> 00:06:50,066
Captain Yami risked
his life to protect us!

88
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,985
And yet, he still
lost the battle,

89
00:06:52,068 --> 00:06:54,070
which proves him to be a fool.

90
00:06:54,154 --> 00:06:55,697
Destroyer!

91
00:06:59,701 --> 00:07:01,119
[ASTA yells]

92
00:07:04,998 --> 00:07:06,875
[ASTA]
Let me go, jerk!

93
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:09,169
If you can't even hold
your own against me,

94
00:07:09,252 --> 00:07:12,213
there's no possibility
of you saving the captain.

95
00:07:14,299 --> 00:07:18,595
[DEVIL] That's right.
Because you're weak.

96
00:07:22,432 --> 00:07:28,104
This is all my fault.
I'm not strong enough.

97
00:07:31,066 --> 00:07:33,234
You really are a fool.

98
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,199
But you do seem
like a good person.

99
00:07:39,282 --> 00:07:42,535
Which is why I like you.

100
00:07:42,619 --> 00:07:45,622
No need to worry.
Yami's still alive.

101
00:07:47,165 --> 00:07:49,959
[ASTA]
Weg? Who are you?

102
00:07:50,043 --> 00:07:52,212
Tell the truth!

103
00:07:52,295 --> 00:07:55,507
I'm Vice Captain Nacht
of the Black Bulls.

104
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:56,925
A pleasure.

105
00:07:59,052 --> 00:08:02,347
[NACHT] I can teach you
how to use your devil power.

106
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,557
If you would like
to learn, that is.

107
00:08:05,558 --> 00:08:10,105
[ASTA] Did he just say he's the
vice captain of the Black Bulls?

108
00:08:10,188 --> 00:08:11,606
[GIMODELO]
What'd I miss, Nacht?

109
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:14,401
And who's this puny guy
you're talking to?

110
00:08:14,484 --> 00:08:16,569
[ASTA]
That ki. A devil!

111
00:08:16,653 --> 00:08:18,154
I hate to tell you
this, Gimodelo,

112
00:08:18,238 --> 00:08:20,073
but you're a whole lot
punier than he is.

113
00:08:20,156 --> 00:08:23,743
[GIMODELO laughs]
Don't even start!

114
00:08:23,827 --> 00:08:26,663
You're only saying that because
I'm not in my true form!

115
00:08:26,746 --> 00:08:29,791
[ASTA] They're talking
like best buddies!

116
00:08:29,874 --> 00:08:32,502
You're possessed
by a devil, too?

117
00:08:32,585 --> 00:08:33,628
Precisely.

118
00:08:33,712 --> 00:08:36,006
This little imp
right here is Gimodelo.

119
00:08:36,089 --> 00:08:39,175
[GIMODELO laughs]

120
00:08:39,259 --> 00:08:42,637
[ASTA gasps]
That's our crest. So it is true!

121
00:08:42,721 --> 00:08:45,598
Are you really our vice captain?

122
00:08:45,682 --> 00:08:49,269
Yes. Although, Yami basically
decided that himself.

123
00:08:49,352 --> 00:08:52,022
[GIMODELO]
Aw, don't make me leave!

124
00:08:52,105 --> 00:08:53,898
This whole thing is so crazy.

125
00:08:53,982 --> 00:08:56,526
[NACHT] It's no surprise
you don't know about me.

126
00:08:56,609 --> 00:08:59,529
After all, I've only
been to the hideout once.

127
00:08:59,612 --> 00:09:01,448
And why is that?

128
00:09:01,531 --> 00:09:03,700
It's because I despise Yami.

129
00:09:03,783 --> 00:09:05,076
Huh?

130
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,537
I hate to admit it,
but stubborn people like him

131
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,540
tend to be very resilient.

132
00:09:10,623 --> 00:09:12,959
He's still got some
time left to live.

133
00:09:13,043 --> 00:09:17,088
But, how do you
know that for sure?

134
00:09:17,172 --> 00:09:18,548
Well, I've been undercover

135
00:09:18,631 --> 00:09:20,967
in the Spade Kingdom
for a long time now.

136
00:09:21,051 --> 00:09:22,344
[ASTA gasps]

137
00:09:25,096 --> 00:09:27,474
[ASTA]
I don't know much about you,

138
00:09:27,557 --> 00:09:30,268
and I'm not even sure
if I can trust you.

139
00:09:30,352 --> 00:09:31,603
But...

140
00:09:31,686 --> 00:09:33,313
...you're the only person
who might know

141
00:09:33,396 --> 00:09:35,690
how to get Captain Yami back!

142
00:09:35,774 --> 00:09:37,150
So, please help me!

143
00:09:37,233 --> 00:09:40,612
Teach me everything you can
about my devil power!

144
00:09:40,695 --> 00:09:41,696
[NACHT]
Good.

145
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,490
I'm glad to see
you're straightforward.

146
00:09:43,573 --> 00:09:45,742
I quite like that
trait in a person.

147
00:09:45,825 --> 00:09:47,410
[ASTA]
Um, thank you!

148
00:09:47,494 --> 00:09:49,079
But as of right now,

149
00:09:49,162 --> 00:09:51,247
I can't say that I'm
sensing even a smidgeon

150
00:09:51,331 --> 00:09:52,916
of talent within you.

151
00:09:52,999 --> 00:09:56,419
Huh? Wow, tell me
how you really feel!

152
00:09:56,503 --> 00:09:59,714
[NACHT] I'm sure it'll work out
if you learn to use your powers.

153
00:09:59,798 --> 00:10:01,800
Yeah? Great, let's do it!

154
00:10:01,883 --> 00:10:04,427
Oh, no, you need
to get some rest first.

155
00:10:04,511 --> 00:10:06,012
[ASTA muffled]
Huh?

156
00:10:06,096 --> 00:10:07,847
[NACHT] There's somewhere I'd
like to go with you tomorrow,

157
00:10:07,931 --> 00:10:10,100
so take it easy tonight.

158
00:10:10,183 --> 00:10:13,061
[ASTA muffled] You expect me to
be able to sleep right now?

159
00:10:13,144 --> 00:10:16,189
[NACHT] Just do it.
I hate selfish people.

160
00:10:25,657 --> 00:10:28,660
Excellent. It seems
you're all here.

161
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:36,960
[MARX] Now, then, let's begin
the emergency captains' meeting.

162
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,436
This concludes the report
from the Black Bulls

163
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:56,271
who witnessed the attack.

164
00:10:56,354 --> 00:10:58,064
The Tree of Qliphoth.

165
00:10:58,148 --> 00:11:01,026
It's supposed to connect
this world to the underworld.

166
00:11:01,109 --> 00:11:03,111
And to create it,
they need the magic types

167
00:11:03,194 --> 00:11:05,280
that William and Yami possess.

168
00:11:05,363 --> 00:11:08,491
I see. I still can't believe
they kidnapped them!

169
00:11:08,575 --> 00:11:09,868
I can.

170
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,745
Those two allowed themselves
to be caught off guard.

171
00:11:11,828 --> 00:11:15,123
And they dare to call themselves
Magic Knight Squad Captains?

172
00:11:15,206 --> 00:11:17,334
They're just a couple
of lousy men.

173
00:11:17,417 --> 00:11:20,628
[CHARLOTTE] Oh, no!
My sweet Yami's been abducted!

174
00:11:20,712 --> 00:11:21,671
Is he all right?

175
00:11:21,755 --> 00:11:24,257
Ah! I hope they
haven't hurt him!

176
00:11:24,341 --> 00:11:27,886
I haven't had a chance to
confess my love to him yet!

177
00:11:27,969 --> 00:11:30,889
We did everything that we could.

178
00:11:30,972 --> 00:11:32,932
And it still wasn't enough.

179
00:11:33,016 --> 00:11:36,102
The enemy wasn't even
fighting us seriously.

180
00:11:36,186 --> 00:11:39,064
Keh! Yeah, that's a real
likely story, kid.

181
00:11:39,147 --> 00:11:40,398
It sounds to me like you

182
00:11:40,482 --> 00:11:42,525
might've chickened
out on the guy.

183
00:11:42,609 --> 00:11:44,110
Turns out the Golden Dawn's

184
00:11:44,194 --> 00:11:46,613
got a sniveling coward
for a vice captain!

185
00:11:46,696 --> 00:11:48,406
That's enough, Jack.

186
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:50,533
Those foul villains could
be linking this world

187
00:11:50,617 --> 00:11:52,535
to the underworld
even as we speak.

188
00:11:52,619 --> 00:11:56,331
Keh! Then it's all gonna be
fire and brimstone, I guess?

189
00:11:56,414 --> 00:11:59,292
[FUEGOLEON] We must prevent
that outcome at all costs.

190
00:11:59,376 --> 00:12:02,587
Sadly, we don't have
much information.

191
00:12:02,671 --> 00:12:05,882
Great. So we're all gonna
sit around and talk about it?

192
00:12:05,965 --> 00:12:08,176
Genius plan you've got there.

193
00:12:08,259 --> 00:12:09,803
Forget it.

194
00:12:09,886 --> 00:12:13,473
This stupid meeting obviously
isn't going anywhere.

195
00:12:13,556 --> 00:12:14,683
I'm out!

196
00:12:14,766 --> 00:12:17,435
Stop.

197
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,853
You'd better not
be thinking about

198
00:12:18,937 --> 00:12:21,272
going to infiltrate
Spade on your own.

199
00:12:21,356 --> 00:12:25,068
Yeah, right! Just to
rescue that idiot?

200
00:12:25,151 --> 00:12:26,403
Besides, even if I did,

201
00:12:26,486 --> 00:12:28,655
it's not like it would be
any of your business!

202
00:12:28,738 --> 00:12:31,700
You're a fool!
It <i>is</i> our business!

203
00:12:31,783 --> 00:12:34,994
I won't allow a fellow
captain to be so rash!

204
00:12:35,078 --> 00:12:37,914
Because I wanna go
save Yami, too!

205
00:12:37,997 --> 00:12:39,958
Kyeh! Well, it's better
than just sitting here

206
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:42,043
picking our noses all day.

207
00:12:42,127 --> 00:12:44,421
Believe me, Jack, I want the
chance to kill that monster

208
00:12:44,504 --> 00:12:46,297
just as badly as you do!

209
00:12:46,381 --> 00:12:49,134
Everyone! Settle down right now!

210
00:12:49,217 --> 00:12:50,677
Yeah or what?

211
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,222
Lord Julius.

212
00:12:54,305 --> 00:12:58,101
[NACHT] Good to see you're
all motivated, at least.

213
00:12:58,184 --> 00:12:59,853
Still, though.

214
00:12:59,936 --> 00:13:03,273
I dislike those who can't
maintain proper civility.

215
00:13:03,356 --> 00:13:05,025
Uh, hi, Captains!

216
00:13:05,108 --> 00:13:07,861
I'd appreciate it if
you would quiet down.

217
00:13:07,944 --> 00:13:09,946
Set a better example.

218
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,364
[YUNO]
Asta.

219
00:13:11,448 --> 00:13:14,659
Who is this intruder?
Declare yourself!

220
00:13:14,743 --> 00:13:15,994
Please.

221
00:13:19,748 --> 00:13:21,624
I can assure you
that I have every right

222
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,251
to be included in this meeting.

223
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:25,128
[DEVIL 168A growls]

224
00:13:25,211 --> 00:13:29,049
Whoa, you've got four devils?
I didn't expect that!

225
00:13:29,132 --> 00:13:32,719
[FUEGOLEON] Devils?
So, he's possessed, as well.

226
00:13:32,802 --> 00:13:35,263
Tell us. Who are you?

227
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:37,766
This man is with
the Black Bulls.

228
00:13:37,849 --> 00:13:39,517
He's their vice captain.

229
00:13:39,601 --> 00:13:41,102
Wait, seriously?

230
00:13:41,186 --> 00:13:44,272
He'd been operating in
the Spade Kingdom as a spy.

231
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:47,567
However, I was unaware
that he was possessed.

232
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:50,320
So that's the vice captain
of the Black Bulls?

233
00:13:50,403 --> 00:13:52,864
I didn't realize
we had sent a spy.

234
00:13:52,947 --> 00:13:55,283
[FUEGOLEON] I suppose the
vice captain of Yami's squad

235
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:58,161
could be practically anyone.

236
00:13:58,244 --> 00:14:00,372
[JACK]
Where've I seen this jerk?

237
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:05,126
Wait, I remember you!

238
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:07,212
Your magic is
different now, though.

239
00:14:07,295 --> 00:14:09,297
That man is no more.

240
00:14:12,801 --> 00:14:14,761
[NACHT]
Anyway, we're wasting time.

241
00:14:14,844 --> 00:14:17,764
I suggest we get
straight to the point.

242
00:14:17,847 --> 00:14:19,849
I'd like you all to have a seat.

243
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:23,812
As you know, the gate
to the underworld

244
00:14:23,895 --> 00:14:26,690
is about to be opened
in the Spade Kingdom.

245
00:14:26,773 --> 00:14:28,983
So, we can assume
they're already making

246
00:14:29,067 --> 00:14:33,196
preparations for the ritual
of the advent of Qliphoth.

247
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,532
To do so, they'll
undoubtedly offer Yami

248
00:14:35,615 --> 00:14:38,076
and Vangeance as sacrifices.

249
00:14:39,536 --> 00:14:41,538
[ASTA]
Captain Yami.

250
00:14:41,621 --> 00:14:44,916
[NACHT] When that's done, the
advent of Qliphoth will begin,

251
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,835
lasting for seven days.

252
00:14:46,918 --> 00:14:50,964
Seven levels, with seven gates,
will open one by one.

253
00:14:51,047 --> 00:14:53,633
Scattered throughout
these gates are ten devils,

254
00:14:53,717 --> 00:14:55,969
each compatible
with the Qliphoth.

255
00:14:56,052 --> 00:15:00,056
The deeper the level, the
stronger the enemies will be.

256
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,850
The upper ones are
about as powerful

257
00:15:01,933 --> 00:15:04,644
as the Dark Triad members,
but as you descend,

258
00:15:04,728 --> 00:15:06,813
they become much fiercer.

259
00:15:06,896 --> 00:15:08,398
What's worse,

260
00:15:08,481 --> 00:15:14,571
if the final devil, Lucifero,
emerges, this world is done for.

261
00:15:14,654 --> 00:15:18,199
Yami and Vangeance will
be killed by this process.

262
00:15:18,283 --> 00:15:19,868
But, as the catalysts,

263
00:15:19,951 --> 00:15:22,537
they'll be kept alive
until the last gate opens.

264
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,913
[gasps]

265
00:15:23,997 --> 00:15:25,331
[NOZEL]
Impressive.

266
00:15:25,415 --> 00:15:28,460
He managed to gain this much
information on his own?

267
00:15:28,543 --> 00:15:31,755
And from the very heart of
the enemy's country, no less.

268
00:15:31,838 --> 00:15:33,757
But why would the
Dark Triad want to attempt

269
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,508
something that's so dangerous?

270
00:15:35,592 --> 00:15:39,387
It isn't the kind of thing
we could ever understand.

271
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:41,264
As Magic Knights,
I'm sure you've met

272
00:15:41,348 --> 00:15:43,975
more than your share
of people like them.

273
00:15:44,059 --> 00:15:46,603
Those who care only
about themselves and hurt

274
00:15:46,686 --> 00:15:49,814
without hesitation to
satisfy their own desire,

275
00:15:49,898 --> 00:15:54,319
who feel no guilt or shame,
no matter how low they sink.

276
00:15:54,402 --> 00:15:56,112
Personally, I would
never even want

277
00:15:56,196 --> 00:15:58,490
to understand
what motivates them.

278
00:15:58,573 --> 00:16:01,868
They are the worst
sort of trash imaginable.

279
00:16:01,951 --> 00:16:05,455
Irrational evil. There's
nothing I hate more.

280
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,043
Perhaps God and the
devils will forgive them

281
00:16:10,126 --> 00:16:13,296
for what they've done,
but I never will.

282
00:16:15,465 --> 00:16:20,136
That being said, I can't defeat
the Dark Triad without help.

283
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,764
I'm aware of my own limitations.

284
00:16:22,847 --> 00:16:25,850
I won't attempt something
beyond my abilities.

285
00:16:25,934 --> 00:16:27,268
Which is why,

286
00:16:27,352 --> 00:16:28,978
I'll make him
the warrior we need.

287
00:16:29,062 --> 00:16:30,230
Huh?

288
00:16:30,313 --> 00:16:31,731
[gasps]

289
00:16:31,815 --> 00:16:35,610
We'll harness the potential
of his Anti-magic.

290
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:37,987
In three days, the gate
to the underworld

291
00:16:38,071 --> 00:16:39,572
will be opened.

292
00:16:39,656 --> 00:16:42,575
Before that happens, we're going
to take back Yami and Vangeance

293
00:16:42,659 --> 00:16:45,495
and destroy the
Tree of Qliphoth.

294
00:16:45,578 --> 00:16:47,914
Using my magic,
we'll be able to infiltrate

295
00:16:47,997 --> 00:16:50,083
their castle without
being detected.

296
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:52,335
Once inside, we'll
attack the Dark Triad

297
00:16:52,419 --> 00:16:54,921
and take each of them down.

298
00:16:55,005 --> 00:16:57,632
Dante has gravity
and body magic.

299
00:16:57,716 --> 00:17:00,635
Vanica has curse-warding
and blood magic.

300
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:03,596
Zenon has spatial
and bone magic.

301
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,015
[YUNO]
Zenon.

302
00:17:05,098 --> 00:17:08,101
[NACHT] I won't be able to
take many people with me.

303
00:17:08,184 --> 00:17:10,145
We need to select a group
that has the best chance

304
00:17:10,228 --> 00:17:14,190
of success against the devils,
with Asta at its center.

305
00:17:14,274 --> 00:17:16,401
Keh! No wonder
you're here, then.

306
00:17:16,484 --> 00:17:18,653
Clearly, squad captains
are the ones you want

307
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:20,405
for this kinda thing.

308
00:17:20,488 --> 00:17:22,532
[YUNO]
Let me go.

309
00:17:22,615 --> 00:17:27,454
I know it's impudent to ask,
but please, let me join you.

310
00:17:27,537 --> 00:17:29,873
Tch! Are you, stupid?

311
00:17:29,956 --> 00:17:31,374
Like hell we're
gonna send anyone

312
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,543
who's already lost to them.

313
00:17:33,626 --> 00:17:36,963
Yuno, I understand how
you feel right now,

314
00:17:37,047 --> 00:17:38,965
but staying behind to
protect the Clover Kingdom

315
00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:41,134
is also a vital task.

316
00:17:41,217 --> 00:17:42,886
[ASTA]
Yuno.

317
00:17:42,969 --> 00:17:46,556
[NACHT] Actually, I did
want to ask you something.

318
00:17:46,639 --> 00:17:48,892
There's a resistance movement
in the Spade Kingdom

319
00:17:48,975 --> 00:17:52,645
that seeks to undermine
the Dark Triad's rule.

320
00:17:52,729 --> 00:17:54,522
Not long ago, a member
of this movement

321
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:57,067
snuck across the border
and into Clover.

322
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:59,652
He's at your hideout
now, isn't he?

323
00:17:59,736 --> 00:18:01,946
What's this?

324
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:05,158
Tell me. Who are you, really?

325
00:18:08,495 --> 00:18:12,665
[YUNO] Apparently, I'm the
prince of the Spade Kingdom.

326
00:18:12,749 --> 00:18:14,918
[ALL gasp]

327
00:18:15,001 --> 00:18:17,712
[screams]

328
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:19,881
Prince?! No freaking way!

329
00:18:19,964 --> 00:18:22,592
Come on, you're not serious
about this, are you?

330
00:18:22,676 --> 00:18:23,968
[YUNO]
Yes.

331
00:18:24,052 --> 00:18:27,263
I was a newborn when the
royal family was overthrown.

332
00:18:27,347 --> 00:18:30,433
Someone smuggled me out
and brought me to Clover.

333
00:18:30,517 --> 00:18:32,060
[NOZEL]
I see. He's royalty,

334
00:18:32,143 --> 00:18:35,522
that explains the tremendous
amount of mana he has.

335
00:18:35,605 --> 00:18:37,649
The man that you
mentioned before,

336
00:18:37,732 --> 00:18:40,652
he was loyal to the
previous rulers of Spade.

337
00:18:40,735 --> 00:18:43,571
He should know a great deal
about the enemy and the castle.

338
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:45,532
[JACK]
Keh! That's even more reason

339
00:18:45,615 --> 00:18:47,158
not to let you in on this.

340
00:18:47,242 --> 00:18:50,036
For all we know, that
guy's an enemy spy!

341
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,496
And not just him, either.

342
00:18:51,579 --> 00:18:54,666
Who says you're
not a spy, yourself?

343
00:18:54,749 --> 00:18:57,293
If I don't save him,
then there's no point.

344
00:18:57,377 --> 00:18:59,337
You don't understand.

345
00:18:59,421 --> 00:19:02,590
Since the elves attacked,
you've been cautious.

346
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:06,386
You weren't sure you could
still trust Captain Vangeance.

347
00:19:06,469 --> 00:19:08,888
And I can't blame you for that.

348
00:19:08,972 --> 00:19:12,267
He couldn't choose between
the humans and the elves,

349
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,894
and our kingdom suffered.

350
00:19:14,978 --> 00:19:18,273
But that's exactly why,
no matter how much he's hurting,

351
00:19:18,356 --> 00:19:21,568
he continues to fight more
earnestly than anyone else.

352
00:19:21,651 --> 00:19:25,905
I was defeated by Zenon,
but I remember...

353
00:19:25,989 --> 00:19:28,658
As I was blacking out...

354
00:19:28,742 --> 00:19:31,870
While he fought, Captain
Vangeance did his best

355
00:19:31,953 --> 00:19:34,956
to keep the Golden Dawn safe.

356
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,167
If you rid yourself of
some of that baggage,

357
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:40,045
you'd be able to focus more
of your strength on our battle.

358
00:19:40,128 --> 00:19:42,756
But you won't do that, will you?

359
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:46,843
And that's exactly why
you're going to lose.

360
00:19:46,926 --> 00:19:49,596
Of course I won't
abandon them.

361
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,641
I made them walk a path of
thorns, but they rose again.

362
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:57,896
They forged ahead,
without resentment or regret.

363
00:19:57,979 --> 00:19:59,981
They are all I could
ask them to be.

364
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:01,733
They are my dream!

365
00:20:01,816 --> 00:20:04,736
He was only captured because
he was protecting us.

366
00:20:04,819 --> 00:20:07,697
He could have saved
himself, but he didn't.

367
00:20:07,781 --> 00:20:09,074
Maybe to you he's a traitor

368
00:20:09,157 --> 00:20:11,743
who once turned his
back on this kingdom.

369
00:20:11,826 --> 00:20:13,453
But to us, he's not.

370
00:20:13,536 --> 00:20:16,748
He's everything a squad
captain should be!

371
00:20:16,831 --> 00:20:18,541
Yuno.

372
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:21,753
[YUNO] That monster thinks
he annihilated the Golden Dawn.

373
00:20:21,836 --> 00:20:23,171
He's wrong.

374
00:20:23,254 --> 00:20:24,589
Thanks to the captain's magic,

375
00:20:24,673 --> 00:20:27,342
we're alive and
ready to fight back!

376
00:20:27,425 --> 00:20:29,594
This war is far from over.

377
00:20:29,678 --> 00:20:32,180
The Golden Dawn
is still standing.

378
00:20:32,263 --> 00:20:35,642
The greatest Magic Knight Squad
in the Clover Kingdom!

379
00:20:35,725 --> 00:20:37,602
I'm going to prove that
he did the right thing

380
00:20:37,686 --> 00:20:39,813
when he protected us.

381
00:20:39,896 --> 00:20:43,817
They'll see just
how powerful we are!

382
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:47,696
I will be the one who
saves Captain Vangeance!

383
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:50,156
[JACK]
The hell's up with this mana?

384
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,408
Enough!

385
00:20:51,491 --> 00:20:53,201
Just sit down and
shut up already, will ya?

386
00:20:53,284 --> 00:20:57,205
[BELL]
Instead, how about you shut up?

387
00:20:57,288 --> 00:21:00,291
I'm kinda busy
storing up mana, here.

388
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:03,294
We're gonna take down
that bony bastard!

389
00:21:03,378 --> 00:21:06,172
Yuno won't lose to him again!

390
00:21:06,256 --> 00:21:07,799
Very well, you're in.

391
00:21:07,882 --> 00:21:10,427
I don't actually
hate people like you.

392
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:12,220
You may be the prince
of the Spade Kingdom

393
00:21:12,303 --> 00:21:13,972
and the vice captain
of the Golden Dawn,

394
00:21:14,055 --> 00:21:16,433
but you'll always be Yuno to me!

395
00:21:16,516 --> 00:21:19,227
In three days, we'll depart
early in the morning

396
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,895
for the Spade Kingdom.

397
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:24,107
I'll send you a more
detailed plan later on.

398
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:27,444
This time, we're
on the offensive.

399
00:21:27,527 --> 00:21:29,404
[ASTA] Now that I see
how Yuno's handling this,

400
00:21:29,487 --> 00:21:31,990
I understand there's
no time to cry!

401
00:21:32,073 --> 00:21:35,535
If I was too weak to win, that
means I need to be stronger!

402
00:21:35,618 --> 00:21:40,832
No. I'll push past my limits
and become the strongest!

403
00:21:40,915 --> 00:21:45,295
Let's go defeat the Dark Triad
and save both our captains!

404
00:21:45,378 --> 00:21:47,005
Right!

405
00:21:47,088 --> 00:21:48,840
In that case,
we'd better reach out

406
00:21:48,923 --> 00:21:50,884
to Heart for
assistance, as well.

407
00:21:50,967 --> 00:21:53,845
I've tried, but they haven't
answered me all day.

408
00:21:53,928 --> 00:21:55,388
What?

409
00:21:55,472 --> 00:21:57,724
Do you think something happened
to Charmy and everyone else?

410
00:21:57,807 --> 00:22:01,853
Yesterday, each Dark Triad
member left their castle.

411
00:22:01,936 --> 00:22:04,606
Knowing that,
I'd wager Vanica went off

412
00:22:04,689 --> 00:22:06,107
to attack the Heart Kingdom.

413
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:07,734
You think so?

414
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,451
[gasps]

415
00:22:22,082 --> 00:22:23,958
I don't believe it!

416
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:58,053
[ASTA]
No way!

417
00:23:58,136 --> 00:23:59,554
So, the vice captain
of the Black Bulls

418
00:23:59,637 --> 00:24:01,348
can use devil power, too?

419
00:24:01,431 --> 00:24:02,682
Okay, what kind of training

420
00:24:02,766 --> 00:24:05,685
are we gonna do to
make me the best?
