1
00:00:22,554 --> 00:00:25,765
[NARRATOR] Within the clover's
fifth leaf, there lives a devil.

2
00:00:27,225 --> 00:00:29,686
[NARRATOR] Asta, born
unable to harness mana,

3
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:31,479
was granted the
power of Anti-magic

4
00:00:31,563 --> 00:00:33,273
from his five-leaf grimoire,

5
00:00:33,356 --> 00:00:36,693
giving him the ability
to nullify spells.

6
00:00:36,776 --> 00:00:39,404
Unfortunately, the members
of Spade Kingdom's

7
00:00:39,487 --> 00:00:41,448
Dark Triad also possess powers

8
00:00:41,531 --> 00:00:43,908
from the devils of the
underworld and used them

9
00:00:43,992 --> 00:00:47,120
to launch an invasion on
the neighboring countries.

10
00:00:47,203 --> 00:00:49,164
Gaining strength from
his belief in himself

11
00:00:49,247 --> 00:00:51,207
and from the support
of his friends,

12
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:54,669
Asta continues to fight for
the safety of this world.

13
00:01:01,217 --> 00:01:03,845
[NARRATOR] Upon returning
to his home village of Hage,

14
00:01:03,928 --> 00:01:05,972
Yuno was introduced
to a mysterious man

15
00:01:06,056 --> 00:01:08,850
from the Spade Kingdom
named Ralph.

16
00:01:08,933 --> 00:01:09,976
[RALPH]
Lord Yuno.

17
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,979
Our nation's future
is in your hands.

18
00:01:13,063 --> 00:01:15,273
You belong to the royal
House of Grinberryall.

19
00:01:15,357 --> 00:01:17,901
Its scion, the prince
and rightful heir

20
00:01:17,984 --> 00:01:20,653
to the Spade Kingdom's throne!

21
00:01:20,737 --> 00:01:24,115
[NARRATOR] Ralph revealed
the truth about Yuno's birth.

22
00:01:26,534 --> 00:01:27,869
[NARRATOR]
Just then,

23
00:01:27,952 --> 00:01:30,246
Yuno received word that the
Golden Dawn headquarters

24
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:31,664
was under attack.

25
00:01:31,748 --> 00:01:35,752
[YUNO] Even so, I'm also Yuno
of the Clover Kingdom.

26
00:01:37,545 --> 00:01:40,131
[NARRATOR] The perpetrators were
two Spade Kingdom mages

27
00:01:40,215 --> 00:01:42,509
named Gaderois and Foyal.

28
00:01:42,592 --> 00:01:44,636
[GADEROIS] Only a select few
were good enough to get powers

29
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:48,014
from the Dark Triad, and we
were at the top of the list!

30
00:01:48,098 --> 00:01:53,019
We're the Dark Disciples!
All of us are stage-zero mages!

31
00:01:53,103 --> 00:01:55,772
[NARRATOR] They were led
by Zenon of the Dark Triad,

32
00:01:55,855 --> 00:01:57,899
who was possessed by a devil.

33
00:02:00,318 --> 00:02:03,780
[NARRATOR] And their goal
was soon clear.

34
00:02:03,863 --> 00:02:07,325
[WILLIAM] World Tree Magic:
Magic Warding Ash!

35
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:10,286
So that's World
Tree Magic, is it?

36
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:13,540
Our side could
certainly use that.

37
00:02:13,623 --> 00:02:16,543
I'll be taking you with me.

38
00:02:16,626 --> 00:02:19,671
[ZENON]
Bone Magic: Eternal Fangs.

39
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,298
[NARRATOR]
By the time Yuno arrived

40
00:02:22,382 --> 00:02:24,926
at the Golden Dawn
headquarters...

41
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:26,720
[YUNO]
I'm here!

42
00:02:26,803 --> 00:02:29,889
[NARRATOR] A grim tragedy
had already unfolded.

43
00:02:31,891 --> 00:02:35,729
[YUNO] What the hell do
you think you're doing...

44
00:02:36,771 --> 00:02:38,773
...to my comrades?

45
00:04:13,868 --> 00:04:15,328
[ALECDORA] When you came
to the Golden Dawn,

46
00:04:15,412 --> 00:04:18,373
some of our squad looked down
on you for being a commoner.

47
00:04:18,456 --> 00:04:21,501
They resented you and were
jealous of your powers.

48
00:04:21,584 --> 00:04:23,837
And I was no exception.

49
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,172
How can you stand up
for people like us,

50
00:04:26,256 --> 00:04:28,591
given the way we've behaved?

51
00:04:28,675 --> 00:04:32,762
[YUNO] We're comrades.
I don't need another reason.

52
00:04:32,846 --> 00:04:35,265
Just that I care.

53
00:04:35,348 --> 00:04:36,933
Apologies.

54
00:04:38,852 --> 00:04:39,853
[HAMON]
When we're finished,

55
00:04:39,936 --> 00:04:42,522
let's all go out
to eat together!

56
00:04:42,605 --> 00:04:43,732
[KLAUS]
Hey, come back!

57
00:04:43,815 --> 00:04:45,442
[SHIREN]
Yuno.

58
00:04:45,525 --> 00:04:46,776
[HAMON]
You're invited.

59
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,446
In fact, we specifically
invited you.

60
00:04:49,529 --> 00:04:50,947
Oh, I didn't...

61
00:04:51,031 --> 00:04:52,532
[LETOILE] Hamon knows
some great restaurants

62
00:04:52,615 --> 00:04:54,284
around the royal capital.

63
00:04:54,367 --> 00:04:56,578
[DAVID] Yeah, we thought it
might be fun to hit the town

64
00:04:56,661 --> 00:04:58,955
with the whole squad and party!

65
00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:07,172
[DAVID]
Hey!

66
00:05:07,255 --> 00:05:09,424
Don't you go getting a big
head just because you moved

67
00:05:09,507 --> 00:05:12,093
all the way up to Vice Captain
in only 18 months!

68
00:05:12,177 --> 00:05:14,137
Yeah, you better watch it.

69
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,055
I'll try.

70
00:05:15,138 --> 00:05:17,432
[DAVID]
Oh, you got an attitude?

71
00:05:17,515 --> 00:05:20,101
That's it, you're about to get
the noogie to end all noogies!

72
00:05:20,185 --> 00:05:21,478
[GOLDEN DAWN 154AA]
Yuno. You've been smiling

73
00:05:21,561 --> 00:05:23,605
a lot more, recently, huh?

74
00:05:26,566 --> 00:05:28,610
[GOLDEN DAWN 154AA] It's a
good look for you, though!

75
00:05:28,693 --> 00:05:30,111
Excuse me!

76
00:05:30,195 --> 00:05:31,863
I'm the only one who's allowed
to pay that much attention

77
00:05:31,946 --> 00:05:34,866
to Yuno's gorgeous face,
and don't you forget it!

78
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:37,494
[GOLDEN DAWN 154AA]
Ow, stop! Don't do that!

79
00:05:37,577 --> 00:05:39,496
[GOLDEN DAWN 154BB]
No fighting, guys!

80
00:05:44,584 --> 00:05:47,962
[GADEROIS cackles]
We musta killed about half.

81
00:05:48,046 --> 00:05:51,299
And the rest ain't far behind!

82
00:05:51,383 --> 00:05:52,467
Well, at least they died

83
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,427
fighting a strong
opponent, right?

84
00:05:54,511 --> 00:05:56,846
I think they should
feel honored!

85
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:00,767
[YUNO]
Wind Spirit Magic: Spirit Storm!

86
00:06:04,521 --> 00:06:06,481
[GADEROIS]
Ah! So, you've been chosen

87
00:06:06,564 --> 00:06:08,942
by the Wind Spirit, eh?

88
00:06:09,025 --> 00:06:11,319
How about that?

89
00:06:13,738 --> 00:06:16,074
But since my Stone Magic
techniques are enhanced

90
00:06:16,157 --> 00:06:19,661
by devil power, they're
tougher than iron or steel!

91
00:06:19,744 --> 00:06:22,038
So your spells
won't scratch me!

92
00:06:23,498 --> 00:06:26,543
[YUNO] Mana Zone:
Spirit's Hushed Dance.

93
00:06:30,005 --> 00:06:32,465
[GADEROIS] He's attacking me and
protecting his wounded friends

94
00:06:32,549 --> 00:06:34,634
at the same time!

95
00:06:34,718 --> 00:06:36,845
That arcane-stage captain
should be fighting

96
00:06:36,928 --> 00:06:39,180
Lord Zenon right now.

97
00:06:39,264 --> 00:06:41,224
Well, well!

98
00:06:41,307 --> 00:06:45,311
Didn't think anyone below the
captain would be zero-stage!

99
00:06:45,395 --> 00:06:46,771
It looks like
things are finally

100
00:06:46,855 --> 00:06:49,566
getting interesting here!

101
00:06:49,649 --> 00:06:53,069
My name's Gaderois, kid!
Now what's yours?

102
00:06:53,153 --> 00:06:57,532
You don't need to know
my name. You're my enemy!

103
00:06:57,615 --> 00:06:58,867
[GADEROIS grunts]

104
00:07:02,328 --> 00:07:06,166
[GADEROIS laughs]
Don't be like that!

105
00:07:06,249 --> 00:07:10,253
I want us to get acquainted
before I kill ya!

106
00:07:12,505 --> 00:07:14,257
[yells]

107
00:07:15,508 --> 00:07:18,178
Tell me. Why are
you doing this?

108
00:07:18,261 --> 00:07:20,847
Beats me. Just followin' orders!

109
00:07:23,433 --> 00:07:25,310
Only thing I know
is the Dark Triad

110
00:07:25,393 --> 00:07:28,146
is lookin' to snap up
an arcane-stage fighter.

111
00:07:28,229 --> 00:07:30,482
And as long as I get
to have some fun,

112
00:07:30,565 --> 00:07:32,650
that's good enough for me!

113
00:07:34,027 --> 00:07:35,195
[YUNO]
Arcane-stage?

114
00:07:35,278 --> 00:07:39,157
Ah, now, let me tell ya,
these guys are a riot!

115
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,035
They killed that softie
of a king we had

116
00:07:42,118 --> 00:07:44,120
and then gave even
more power to those of us

117
00:07:44,204 --> 00:07:47,582
who were looking
for some action!

118
00:07:47,665 --> 00:07:51,961
The former king was a fool!
Might is always right!

119
00:07:52,045 --> 00:07:55,548
'Cause when you're strong,
you get to make your own rules!

120
00:07:56,549 --> 00:07:57,717
You're insane.

121
00:07:57,801 --> 00:08:00,762
How does somebody enjoy
making people suffer?

122
00:08:00,845 --> 00:08:03,556
Are you even capable
of human emotions?

123
00:08:08,311 --> 00:08:09,688
Of course.

124
00:08:09,771 --> 00:08:11,940
Nothing's more human than
the incredible rush you feel

125
00:08:12,023 --> 00:08:13,858
when you kill somebody.

126
00:08:16,027 --> 00:08:18,405
[GADEROIS]
I'm hooked on it, I tell ya!

127
00:08:18,488 --> 00:08:22,492
And you're a tough guy
like me, so you understand!

128
00:08:22,575 --> 00:08:25,495
[YUNO]
Let's get one thing straight.

129
00:08:25,578 --> 00:08:27,956
I am nothing like you!

130
00:08:29,082 --> 00:08:31,418
[YUNO]
Wind Spirit Creation Magic...

131
00:08:33,503 --> 00:08:34,963
...Spirit of Zephyr!

132
00:08:35,046 --> 00:08:36,631
[yells]

133
00:08:38,758 --> 00:08:40,969
[grunts]

134
00:08:41,052 --> 00:08:42,554
[laughs]

135
00:08:42,637 --> 00:08:44,347
Hey, that's not a bad trick!

136
00:08:44,431 --> 00:08:46,391
But you're no match
for me, little man.

137
00:08:46,474 --> 00:08:48,309
Might as well quit!

138
00:08:48,393 --> 00:08:50,270
I think I understand.

139
00:08:50,353 --> 00:08:54,566
The reason this world is so
screwed up is people like you.

140
00:08:54,649 --> 00:08:56,026
Like me?

141
00:08:56,109 --> 00:08:59,070
[YUNO] That's the way it's
been since the dawn of time.

142
00:08:59,154 --> 00:09:02,282
What are you rambling about?

143
00:09:02,365 --> 00:09:06,202
[GADEROIS] My Stone Magic.
He's canceling it out instantly!

144
00:09:08,204 --> 00:09:11,791
[GADEROIS groans]

145
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:14,169
[YUNO] Whether I'm
a Clover Kingdom mage,

146
00:09:14,252 --> 00:09:18,840
or a Spade Kingdom
prince, either way.

147
00:09:25,263 --> 00:09:27,390
I have to cut you down!

148
00:09:36,858 --> 00:09:42,655
[FOYAL cackling]

149
00:09:42,739 --> 00:09:45,283
[KLAUS]
This spell has enormous range.

150
00:09:45,367 --> 00:09:47,952
I have no way of knowing
where the enemy is!

151
00:09:51,498 --> 00:09:54,167
[FOYAL]
I have to admit,

152
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,753
I'm impressed that your
magic is so solid.

153
00:09:56,836 --> 00:10:00,382
[KLAUS] Steel Magic:
Blazing Spiral Lance!

154
00:10:00,465 --> 00:10:03,093
Heh. It's too bad though.

155
00:10:05,804 --> 00:10:07,472
No matter how
sturdy it may be,

156
00:10:07,555 --> 00:10:10,725
it isn't capable of doing
any damage against me.

00:21:37,704 --> 00:21:39,831
Oh, no. Please, no.

317
00:21:42,042 --> 00:21:43,585
[KLAUS]
Hamon.

318
00:21:44,586 --> 00:21:48,757
He saved so many
of us from dying.

319
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,176
But even his magic couldn't
bring back the people

320
00:21:51,259 --> 00:21:53,219
who were already dead.

321
00:21:57,349 --> 00:22:02,645
[YUNO]
Half our squad... was killed.

322
00:22:02,729 --> 00:22:04,230
Damn it.

323
00:22:06,649 --> 00:22:08,693
[YUNO]
I should've been stronger!

324
00:22:14,657 --> 00:22:21,915
[screams]

325
00:23:57,093 --> 00:23:59,179
[ZENON]
This is only the prologue.

326
00:23:59,262 --> 00:24:01,514
Once our objective
comes to fruition,

327
00:24:01,598 --> 00:24:05,310
all of you will be plunged
into profound misery.
