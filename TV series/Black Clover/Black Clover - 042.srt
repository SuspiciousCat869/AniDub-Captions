1
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:15,625
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:18,416
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:24,708
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:27,250
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:35,750
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:39,750
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,333
[NARRATOR]
The Black Bulls are bound

8
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:45,541
for the Underwater Temple
and the magic stone

9
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:48,208
coveted by the Eye
of the Midnight Sun.

10
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:50,750
Unfortunately, the powerful
mana-driven currents

11
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:53,541
that surround it prevent
all from entering.

12
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:56,083
That mana weakens
during a full moon,

13
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:58,541
giving Noelle one week
in which to master the spell

14
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:00,208
that will allow
underwater travel

15
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:02,750
and help the Magic Knights
reach the temple.

16
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:04,875
Noelle was discouraged
by her inability

17
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:08,333
to control her magic, but
the mysterious girl Kahono,

18
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:10,833
Asta, and the rest of the
Black Bulls cheered her on,

19
00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:12,791
until, finally...

20
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:15,083
[NOELLE]
The Black Bulls accepted me.

21
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:16,708
They relied on me.

22
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:20,541
And now... I want to do
something for them!

23
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:26,333
[NOELLE] Water Creation Magic:
Sea Dragon's Cradle!

24
00:01:29,625 --> 00:01:31,541
It... It worked!

25
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:33,625
[BLACK BULLS cheering]

26
00:01:33,708 --> 00:01:36,375
[NOELLE] Sea Dragon's
Cradle. A new spell!

27
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:39,041
Kahono! Did you see?

28
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:40,666
Huh? Where'd she go?

29
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,291
[KAHONO humming]

30
00:01:42,375 --> 00:01:43,916
You've got great friends.

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,291
In the end, they're
the ones who should

32
00:01:45,375 --> 00:01:48,083
be here cheering you on.
I'm glad it all worked out.

33
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:50,458
Can't wait till the
next time we meet, Noelle.

34
00:01:50,541 --> 00:01:53,166
I'll see you in the Temple. Bye!

35
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:29,375
[YAMI]
Well, tonight's the full moon.

36
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:31,708
With the mana around
here at its weakest,

37
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:35,125
this is our best chance to
get to the Underwater Temple.

38
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,625
[YAMI]
So, you idiots ready to go?

39
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:42,250
Yeah! Just you wait,
Underwater Temple!

40
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:44,458
Just you wait, magic stone!

41
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:48,041
Just you wait, yummy seafood
I've never had before!

42
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:51,541
If I'm lucky, maybe they'll have
some rare vintages to sample.

43
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,583
I wonder who we'll be
up against down there.

44
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,125
I hope they're strong.

45
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:56,375
C'mon, let's go already!

46
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:58,500
The sooner we go,
the sooner we can return,

47
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,458
and the sooner I can see Marie!

48
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:02,750
And then I can get back
to the beach babes!

49
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:05,458
[GREY exhales]

50
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:06,708
[YAMI]
All right, I'm gonna go ahead

51
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:08,666
and take that as a yes, then.

52
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,916
Okay, it looks like you're up!

53
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,083
[NOELLE grunts]

54
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:15,625
What's wrong? You're not
gettin' nervous, are you?

55
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:17,166
No way!

56
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,541
It's not like there's anything
for me to be nervous about!

57
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,250
I pulled it off fine yesterday.

58
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,916
[VANESSA laughs]
Easy, sweetie.

59
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,166
Have a sip, you're
stiff as a board.

60
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,958
How about you not offer alcohol

61
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:29,625
to the person we're
trustin' with our lives?

62
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,083
[YAMI] When you're under
a lotta pressure,

63
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:35,458
things can go wrong,
even if they've gone right

64
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:38,291
100 times before.

65
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:42,041
Just remember,
ya gotta try and relax.

66
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:44,333
And if you do screw this up,
I'm gonna kill ya.

67
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:45,250
[NOELLE yelps]

68
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,708
Oh, yeah, no pressure at all!

69
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:50,333
[NOELLE]
Honestly. What is with them?

70
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:53,291
It almost feels silly
to be nervous now.

71
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,458
I mean, really.

72
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:58,291
If my spell fails,
we could all die.

73
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:01,916
But no one seems
that worried about it.

74
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,125
Okay. Here goes.

75
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:11,958
Water Creation Magic:
Sea Dragon's Cradle!

76
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:19,458
[BLACK BULLS]
Whoa!

77
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:24,166
I did it! I cast the spell!

78
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,041
Yeah, we knew you could do it!

79
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:26,750
But, uh...

80
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,291
[BLACK BULLS groaning]

81
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:29,958
[ASTA]
We're a little squished here.

82
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,208
Yer big enough without
the floaty thing!

83
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,583
Should I kill Grey?

84
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:37,583
[FINRAL] Come on! Transform
into someone smaller!

85
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:39,708
--[GREY] Ha!
--[BLACK BULLS sigh]

86
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:42,833
Well, peons, is this better?

87
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:45,083
[ASTA]
Now can we shrink the attitude?

88
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,583
[YAMI]
Not a bad job at all, Noelle.

89
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:53,625
Now you just gotta get us down
to the Underwater Temple.

90
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:55,500
Right! I've got it covered.

91
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,500
Everybody, hang on tight.

92
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,791
[NOELLE]
He complimented me!

93
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,500
[BLACK BULLS gasping]

94
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:10,625
[VANESSA laughing]

95
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,500
So cool!

96
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:15,041
It's almost like we're
flying through the ocean!

97
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,625
[CHARMY, GREY]
Look at all those yummy fish

98
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:18,166
begging to be turned into lunch!

99
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,416
Take a look, Marie.

100
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,125
We're travelling under
the water using magic!

101
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:24,416
Noelle, get us closer
to those fish.

102
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,583
Marie wants to see them!

103
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:29,125
It doesn't work
like that, moron!

104
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:30,916
[GAUCHE]
No! Come back!

105
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,416
I'm lost without the sight of...

106
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,708
I can already feel the mana
getting stronger down here.

107
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:35,458
What's that?

108
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:37,125
[ASTA yelps]

109
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:38,833
[MAGNA]
Doesn't look good!

110
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:41,458
[YAMI] I'd say we've reached
the strong magic region.

111
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:43,583
[BLACK BULLS yelling]

112
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:46,708
This is what it's like down here
when the mana's at its weakest?

113
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:49,083
Man, this strong magic
region is somethin' else!

114
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:52,833
Uh... This bubble thing
isn't gonna pop on us, is it?

115
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:55,333
You've gotta be pretty scared,
being a Flame mage and all.

116
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:57,125
Please! I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

117
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,500
I've never been
scared in my life!

118
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:01,958
[BLACK BULLS shouting]

119
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:03,875
[ASTA] Noelle, Noelle, she's
our man, if she can't do it...

120
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,583
[NOELLE]
Will you three be quiet, please?

121
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:08,333
I'm trying to concentrate, here!

122
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:11,000
[NOELLE] I'm just barely
avoiding all these currents.

123
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:14,083
It's almost like the
mana is helping me!

124
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:15,500
This'll work!

125
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:19,083
[VANESSA gags]
Feel sick. Think I'm gonna puke.

126
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:21,375
[GAUCHE] Don't even think
about it, you wino!

127
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,833
[NOELLE]
The currents have let up a bit!

128
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:33,583
[BLACK BULLS gasp]

129
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,250
[BLACK BULLS]
Whoa!

130
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:56,500
[ASTA]
Cool!

131
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:57,500
It's beautiful!

132
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:58,791
They've sure got
some funky lookin'

133
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,125
animals down here!

134
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:03,375
Yeah! That fish is
glowing like crazy!

135
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:04,958
[MAGNA]
Kinda looks like...

136
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:07,583
Yeah, it's magic!
That's pretty cool.

137
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,291
[YAMI] Guess all this
mana messed with the way

138
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:11,666
the beasties around
here evolved.

139
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,708
Yeah, but do they
taste any good?

140
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:16,666
Let's catch one and find out
if its flavors evolved, too!

141
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,166
[CHARMY, GREY]
Come here, little fishy-fish!

142
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,250
[MAGNA]
Not so fast!

143
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,458
Are you two idiots seriously

144
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,500
willing to die
for a little food?

145
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:26,250
And, Grey, we really don't need
another bottomless pit around.

146
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:27,250
[YAMI]
Huh?

147
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:30,208
Hey, look. Those whirlpools.

148
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:35,500
It's a magic barrier!
And an extremely powerful one!

149
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,500
My spell won't
get us through it.

150
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,208
Okay, kid, you're up.

151
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:42,500
Give that thing a nice big
slash with your sword.

152
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:43,958
[ASTA]
Captain Yami?

153
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:45,500
[YAMI]
Yeah?

154
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:48,583
[ASTA] The thing is, this was
my first trip to the beach,

155
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:51,791
and it taught me something
really important.

156
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:54,041
I don't know how to swim!

157
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:56,666
Funny, huh? You'd think I
woulda known before now.

158

around for someone

00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:44,208
The name of this
little game is...

317
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:47,041
..."Find Out How Squishy
the Boobs Are."

318
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:49,166
[GIFSO groans]

319
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,958
How about we play
this game instead?

320
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:53,375
[ASTA] Hey! You can't go
beatin' up the high priest.

321
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,083
He's some kinda big shot!

322
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,208
So what? I'm royalty.

323
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,833
It was just a joke!

324
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,541
[NOELLE] Well, now I'm
going to show you exactly

325
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,875
how not funny I think
that kind of joke is.

326
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:06,833
[ASTA] I really don't think
that's a good idea, Noelle!

327
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:08,708
All right, enough
messin' around.

328
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:10,416
We didn't drag our butts
all the way out here

329
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,791
to play games with you!

330
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:14,916
How'd you know we were after
the magic stone, anyway?

331
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:18,791
You'd be surprised how well
these old eyes still see.

332
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,083
So, what are you going to do?

333
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:23,083
Your kingdom needs
that stone. Doesn't it?

334
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:26,333
Whaddya think? Beat 'im up
and, uh, take it by force?

335
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:28,833
Yeah, that would
probably be the fastest.

336
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:30,791
It looks like the
geezer's super powerful,

337
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,291
so fighting him would
get my vote, for sure.

338
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:33,500
What kinda twisted stuff

339
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:35,041
are you three
plotting over here?!

340
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:38,125
Beating up old men isn't what
the Magic Knights are about!

341
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:41,250
[FINRAL] I'm telling you,
that's no ordinary old man.

342
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,625
We don't want to get caught up
with someone like him.

343
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:47,166
[VANESSA yawns] Do you think
we have time to take a nap?

344
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,500
[CHARMY] Forget napping.
I wanna know when dinner is.

345
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:51,458
And do you three
even care at all?

346
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,708
[GIFSO] Aw. Haven't you
made up your minds yet?

347
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:56,375
Play with me, and not only
will you get the magic stone,

348
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:58,958
but I'll round up the
temple's loveliest ladies,

349
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:01,250
finest drinks,
and tastiest food.

350
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:02,875
We'll have a
magnificent banquet.

351
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:06,291
What do ya think?
Shall we play?

352
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,125
[ALL]
Yeah, let's do it!

353
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:12,708
[yells] Is that seriously
what's more important to you?

354
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:16,083
I'll play the game 'cause of our
mission, not some stupid party!

355
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:18,083
That's enough outta you.

356
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:22,000
Looks like we got no choice.

357
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,500
All right, then, old man.

358
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:26,416
You wanna play so bad,
take on this master gambler.

359
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,500
Go get 'im!

360
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:29,000
No one can outplay you,
Captain Yami!

361
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:31,625
Okay, so what game
is it gonna be?

362
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:33,625
Dice? Roulette?

363
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:37,125
Woo-hoo! A brawl!

364
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:40,000
A real Temple battle royale!

365
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:42,416
Yeah!

366
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,125
Yeah! Yeah!

367
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:46,125
Yeah! Yeah, ye-yeah!

368
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:49,208
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah-yeah!

369
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:53,416
Temple mages, come on down!

370
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:58,791
Game Magic: It's time
for Temple Shuffle!

371
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:00,541
--[BLACK BULLS gasp]
--[ASTA] What the...?

372
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:02,750
Looks like more doors.

373
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:10,208
[TEMPLE MAGES]
You summoned us, High Priest?

374
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:11,708
[TEMPLE MAGE 42A]
Finally, mages from the outside

375
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,500
have come to visit us!

376
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,875
[TEMPLE MAGE 42B]
Ooh, this is gonna be fun!

377
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:18,750
[MORAY EEL MAGE]
I'm not sure.

378
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:21,291
They don't seem as
impressive as we'd thought.

379
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:23,833
[ASTA]
A buncha talking fish!

380
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:25,041
[MAGNA]
Come on.

381
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:26,916
Those're the lamest
masks I've ever seen.

382
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,083
Oh, this is bad. I'm sensing
a ton of power here.

383
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:32,416
Are these mages temple warriors?

384
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:37,583
[GIFSO] All righty!
Shall we get started?

385
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:38,583
Like, now?

386
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,375
What exactly are we starting?

387
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:43,833
[laughs] Are you ready?

388
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:48,166
Okay! Let's go!

389
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,708
I'm totally not ready!

390
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:56,625
[GIFSO cackles]

391
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:02,375
[screaming]

392
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:09,416
What the heck?

393
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,875
Where am I?
Where's everyone else?

394
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:15,041
[GIFSO] Uh, testing, testing!
Can you all hear me?

395
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,083
[gasps]

396
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:17,833
[GIFSO]
As you may have noticed,

397
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:20,791
you've been separated
and placed in various spots

398
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:22,041
throughout the Temple.

399
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:24,875
[LUCK] So all this is
inside the temple? Cool!

400
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:26,083
[GIFSO]
...a short while ago.

401
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,666
[MAGNA]
The hell kinda game is this?

402
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,916
Where do they keep
the food in this place?

403
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,416
[GIFSO]
...battle of magic and witts!

404
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,625
[NOELLE] Wait, I never actually
learned any attack magic.

405
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:38,291
How is it that I'm just
realizing this now?

406
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:39,666
Hold on.

407
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,125
Did he say it was going
to be a nine-on-nine battle?

408
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:43,750
But, there should be ten of us.

409
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:45,708
[GIFSO]
The rules are very simple.

410
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,500
Knock them out, and you win.

411
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,291
Make them surrender,
and you win.

412
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:52,125
Well, I'm a little bit
more awake now, at least.

413
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:54,583
[GIFSO] ...or the one with
the most players left standing

414
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:56,500
when the game concludes!

415
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:58,166
[muttering] Who should
I transform into next,

416
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,541
little crab?

417
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:02,541
[GIFSO]
You may play any way you like.

418
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:05,625
Fight one-on-one. Hide and
hope to outlast the others.

419
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:08,291
Find your friends, band
together, and swarm the enemy!

420
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,125
The choice is yours!

421
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:12,375
[FINRAL] What kind of
vicious game is this?

422
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,500
That's it. I'm outta here.
Good luck, guys.

423
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:16,375
[GIFSO] Just make sure
you keep an eye out

424
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:20,333
for my nuisance spells.
They can be a bit startling.

425
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:22,125
[GAUCHE]
Nuisance spells?

426
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:24,583
I'll show you
a nuisance, old man.

427
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:26,625
Oh, yeah! I'm so there!

428
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:29,208
This is gonna be
a total bloodbath!

429
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:34,375
All right, I got it!
Now, let's go! I'm ready!

430
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:36,083
[OCTOPUS MAGE]
What's this?

431
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,708
[OCTOPUS MAGE]
How interesting.

432
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:42,666
I'm not sensing so much as a
scrap of magic coming from you.

433
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,500
Tell me. Can you even fight?

434
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:49,208
[OCTOPUS MAGE]
Too bad.

435
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:51,166
I was hoping for
a good opponent,

436
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,500
but it looks like I got a dud.

437
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,375
[ASTA]
You think I'm a dud, huh?

438
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:57,958
Just try me and find out.

"There's 10 of Us."

441

[TEMPLE MAGES]
You summoned us, High Priest?

442
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:43,041
[GIFSO] I'm sorry to call the
nine of you here like this.

443
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:45,458
However, there is
an urgent matter

444
00:22:45,541 --> 00:22:47,583
that I needed to
discuss with you.

Huh?

Wait a minute.

Now that you're
all standing here.

00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:53,583
I sense that something's amiss.

There's one too many!

This is unbelievable!

Is there something wrong?

00:23:16,416 --> 00:23:18,333

Yeah. I'd say there is.

exactly a sea creature.

Oh, I get it.

You're messing
with me. Ha, ha, ha.

what's your favorite food?

I'm an elephant!

00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:42,041
Have you ever tried a peanut?

00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:44,500
No? You should,
they're delicious!

472
00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:46,416
Really!

I know what you're after.

Yeah, that's right,
I'm the high priest here.
