[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:18,458
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:24,333
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:26,958
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:35,541
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:39,875
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,208
[NARRATOR] The Star Festival
is an annual event

8
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:45,375
at which the number of
stars bestowed upon each

9
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:47,208
of the Magic Knight squads
during that year

10
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:50,083
by the Wizard King is
announced to the public.

11
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:51,708
The squad whose
accomplishments were greater

12
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:54,166
than all the others is
awarded the topmost rank,

13
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,666
which is an unparalleled honor.

[FESTIVALGOER 69D]
The Star Ceremony's

00:00:57,875 --> 00:01:00,000
getting ready to start!

16
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:02,291
[FESTIVALGOER 69E] All th
captains are going to be there!

17
00:01:02,375 --> 00:01:03,625
[FESTIVALGOER 69AA]
Even the new captains

18
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:06,583
of the Crimson Lion Kings
and the Purple Orcas!

19
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:10,000
All of 'em? Uh-oh.

20
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:13,583
Dammit, we're late.
Eh, they'll wait for me.

21
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,208
[JULIUS]
Citizens!

22
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:50,083
Thank you all so much
for attending.

23
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:53,166
Hey, look! It's the Wizard King!

24
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,166
[CROWD cheers]

25
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,666
The Magic Knight
squads have done

26
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,291
some amazing deeds this year.

27
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:00,041
I'm here to recognize them.

28
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:01,750
The Wizard King in the flesh!

29
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:03,208
[CITIZEN 70C]
That's awesome!

30
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:04,750
[JULIUS]
And following my announcement,

31
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:08,208
King Clover himself has
a few words for you as well.

32
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:09,958
[CITIZEN 70D]
Wizard King!

33
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:11,666
That's our Wizard King!

34
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,666
He's so cool! Wow!

35
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,958
Now then.

36
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:17,958
As I assume everyone here
is aware, our nation

37
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:19,958
has suffered attacks
from both the Spade

38
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:21,416
and Diamond Kingdoms.

39
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,250
We're also waging a bitter
war against the relentless

40
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:28,666
terrorist organization known as
the Eye of the Midnight Sun.

41
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,208
When they advanced
on the Capital,

42
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:33,666
many of our people
sacrificed their lives.

43
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,000
At one point, I even
considered canceling

44
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,291
this year's festival.

45
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:39,500
But then, it occurred
to me that this event

46
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,583
would be the ideal
opportunity to honor

47
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:44,458
all of those who bravely
defended this country

48
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:46,208
from our enemies.

49
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:48,750
And so, the moment has come.

50
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:51,250
Please welcome the pride
of Clover Kingdom:

51
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:53,666
our Magic Knight captains!

52
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:57,333
[CROWD cheers]

53
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,625
[CITIZEN 70E]
It's the captains!

54
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:04,458
[JULIUS] Captain of the
Silver Eagles: Nozel Silva!

55
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:08,083
Captain of the Green Praying
Mantises: Jack the Ripper!

56
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:12,041
Captain of the Coral Peacocks:
Dorothy Unsworth!

57
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:15,916
Captain of the Aqua Deer:
Rill Boismortier!

58
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,541
Captain of the Crimson Lion
Kings: Mereoleona Vermillion!

59
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:22,250
[CITIZEN 70F]
Their new captain's a woman?

60
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:24,208
[CITIZEN 70G] I hear she's just
as skilled with Flame Magic

61
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:27,375
as her brother Fuegoleon--
you know, their last captain.

62
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:29,875
In fact, she might
be even better!

63
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:33,833
[JULIUS] The new captain of the
Purple Orcas: Kaiser Granvorka!

64
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:35,708
[CITIZEN 70H]
Another new captain?

65
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:38,083
[CITIZEN 70I] Yeah, that
group's been through a lot.

66
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:40,250
[CITIZEN 70AA] I'm sure
they'll do great things!

67
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,250
And last but not least,

68
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:45,666
the captain of the Golden Dawn:
William Vangeance!

69
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,166
[CITIZEN 70BB squeals]
Captain William!

70
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:51,208
[CITIZEN 70J] The Golden Dawn's
totally gonna win this thing!

71
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,166
[CITIZEN 70K] Wait. Aren't
we missing some people?

72
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,791
[CITIZEN 70CC]
I think so!

73
00:04:56,875 --> 00:05:00,000
[JULIUS] I told them several
times to be punctual.

74
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:03,458
I'd expect this from Yami, but
it's not like Charlotte at all!

75
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:04,625
That's no good.

76
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:06,708
Bein' late makes
a bad impression.

77
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:10,041
[FINRAL] Yeah, you seem
really concerned about it!

78
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,583
Well, I suppose we
should keep moving.

79
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:16,041
It's time to announce
the standings!

80
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:18,708
In first place...

81
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:21,250
The Golden Dawn!

82
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:26,625
Their total number
of stars was 125!

83
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:31,166
That's an improvement on last
year's total of 96 stars!

84
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,625
[CITIZEN 70DD]
Wow!

85
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,250
[CITIZEN 70L]
They're really crushin' it!

86
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:37,041
[CITIZEN 70M]
That's the Golden Dawn for ya!

87
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:39,083
It would appear the
Golden Dawn has managed

88
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:41,500
to pull off an impressive
showing once again.

89
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:44,666
And now, please allow me to
introduce the highest earner

90
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,250
among all the Magic Knights.

91
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,541
Attended by the
Wind spirit Sylph,

92
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:53,500
our promising newcomer, Yuno!

93
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:55,250
[CHARMY]
Huh? Yuno?

94
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:56,666
He's dreamy!

95
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,875
Isn't he?

96
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,666
Excellent work, Yuno!

97
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,875
I'm so proud!

98
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:03,541
Oh, come on.
What did you expect?

99
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:13,125
Yuno. I'm gonna
catch up to you soon!

100
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:15,500
And now for the
second-place winners.

101
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,208
Whaddaya think?
The Crimson Lions?

102
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,333
Nah. I'm sure they
fell behind a lot

103
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:22,166
after Fuegoleon got injured.

104
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,625
My money's on the Silver Eagles!

105
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:26,333
The Blue Rose Knights
deserve to win

106
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:27,750
more than anyone else!

107
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:29,458
I do wonder why
Captain Charlotte's

108
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:30,958
not up on stage, though.

109
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:32,583
[FINRAL]
Hey there.

110
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:35,583
You wanna come walk around
the festival with me?

111
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:38,291
[CITIZEN 70GG] That robe.
You're one of the Black Bulls.

112
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:39,666
Yeah, forget it.

113
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,208
You'll just come in
last place again.

114
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:44,625
Our second-place team is...

115
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,208
No point in listening.

116
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:48,333
Might as well stay here
and goof off right?

117
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:50,750
We know we're dead last.

118
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,166
[JULIUS]
The Black Bulls!

119
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,125
[ALL gasp]

120
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,541
[CITIZEN 70Q]
What?

121
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,041
It can't be!

122
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:01,541
[JULIUS]
Their star total, 101!

123
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:04,416
No way! We got second place?

124
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,916
But how is that possible?

125
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,166
If we're second... Uh-oh.

126
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,041
There's no way this
is really happening.

127
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:11,666
Awesome!

128
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,541
Well, that's quite a surprise.

129
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:15,166
I thought they might
have raised their rank

130
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:19,208
from last year,
but this? Now I see.

131
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:22,166
[CITIZEN 70R] Those goofballs
really took second place?

132
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,500
[CITIZEN 70S]
There must be some mistake.

133
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:25,375
[CITIZEN 70T] Heh. I bet
they threatened somebody.

134
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,625
[CITIZEN 70HH]
They probably cheated somehow.

135
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:29,583
[KAHONO]
No they didn't!

136
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:31,833
The Black Bulls risked
their lives to save us

137
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,208
from the Midnight
Sun, so I won't

138
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:34,916
let you talk about 'em that way!

139
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,291
That's right, and they
would never cheat!

140
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:39,875
Wow, you guys. Thanks a lot.

141
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:42,041
Yeah, they were a big
help to us, too!

142
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:45,541
Some of them are kind of rough,
but they're all nice people!

143
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:49,875
[JULIUS] I don't blame you
all for being surprised.

144
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:52,458
If you'll recall, just
last year, the Black Bulls

145
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:54,250
ended up earning
an unprecedented total

146
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,333
of negative 50 stars.

147
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:58,083
But this year is different.

148
00:07:58,166 --> 00:07:59,875
They've accomplished
unbelievable feats

149
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:03,083
and risen up through the
rankings to claim second-place.

150
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:06,416
Then there's the newcomer
who's especially--

151
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,875
Oh, their captain
is still missing.

152
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:11,083
Hello?

153
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,750
Are any of the Black Bulls
present tonight?

154
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,333
[MAGNA]
Man, this is a shock.

155
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:18,125
[GAME HOST 70A] Uh... I'm sorry
to butt in, gentlemen,

156
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:19,708
but he's askin' for you.

I'm going to let you
have this one, Asta,

so you'd better get up there
before I change my mind!

did grow a lot more

173
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:19,791

over the past year.

Good job.

Looks like you earned
your fair share

of stars for your team.

177

But don't get comfortable.

00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,625
I'll become the
next Wizard King.

I wouldn't talk so big!

180
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,333
Your squad might've gotten
first place and set

181
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:33,208
a new record and everything,
but you'd better not

182
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:34,958
let that go to your head
either, 'cause I'm gonna

00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,666
make sure I earn double
the number of stars

Okay, then I'll get twice that.

00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,708
That's how you wanna play?

187
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:43,541
Then I'll do five
times that many!

188
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,541
Do you even know how
many times more stars

looking at right now?

Uh, two times two times five
would be, er, nine times?

Twenty times, genius.

exciting entrance, wasn't it?

Let's all applaud for
the rookie who's done

00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,958
the most for the Black

Aw. Shucks, guys! Thanks a lot!

among all of the novice Knights.

199
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:14,291
Which means they're two
new stars to watch!

200
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:16,416
They've produced
outstanding results,

considering the
fact they've only

been Knights for half a year.

from the same hometown!

those two are doing
marvelous things!

Yeah, they're probably nobility.

Good evening and felicitations,
my adoring followers.

314
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:14,708
I am your beloved and
benevolent monarch,

315
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:18,541
the celebrated King Augustus
Kira Clover the Thirteenth.

316
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:21,625
[CITIZEN 70AI]
All hail the King. I guess.

317
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:26,500
You can do better than that!

318
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,875
Yikes, is that all it
took for him to snap?

319
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:30,250
Unbelievable.

320
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:32,208
You insolent fools,
I am the sovereign

321
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:34,583
of this great kingdom
and I demand admiration.

322
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,083
Am I making myself clear?

323
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:38,625
Witness this awe-inspiring
royal magic power,

324
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:40,416
handed down through
the generations!

325
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,375
My every single thought
and my appearance.

326
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:46,333
I am a most fitting and
proper King in all respects!

327
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:49,791
This makes me far superior
to a mere Wizard King!

[KING CLOVER laughs, coughs]

00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:54,708
[CITIZEN 70AJ]
Man, I wish the Wizard King

330
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:56,166
could just be our king.

331
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,583
[CITIZEN 70AK] This guy's
a mess. Why's he in charge?

332
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,166
[CITIZEN 70AL] It's not like
we need two separate kings.

333
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:04,583
I think the Wizard King should
be our real king from now on!

Please calm down and
pull yourself together.

[KING CLOVER]
A curse upon you, Julius!

338
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,833
How easily you win the
affection of the people,

339
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:18,666
when I suffer such difficulty!

340
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,708
And what's more...

341
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:23,583
The Golden Dawn
is victorious again?

342
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,291
That featherfaced buffoon!

343
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,375
It's an outrage, I tell you!

344
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:30,541
Some of the other captains
have royal blood.

345
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:32,250
They're much worthier
of first place

346

have to make a dramatic

the support of my flock!

I have an important piece
of news to share with you.

351
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:51,000
We have located the
Midnight Sun's hideout.

Huh? We really found it?

354
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,625
[KING CLOVER] So far in
our battle against them,

355
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:59,416
we've consistently
been one step behind.

356
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,750
But those days are over!

357
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:03,166
You will be pleased to know that

358
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,250
we're preparing to launch
a full-scale counterattack

359
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:06,500
of our own.

360
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:08,458
And to do so, we plan
to gather the absolute

361
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:11,375
cream-of-the-crop from
our Magic Knight squads.

362
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:15,416
Allowing us to assemble the
most elite team imaginable!

363
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:19,833
And that unit will be
called the Royal Knights!

364

In a week's time.

365
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,541
I shall administer a rigorous
exam to the members

366
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,458
of all nine Magic Knight squads.

367
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:27,625
Only those who pass
the test will be invited

368
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:29,916
to join my Royal Knights!

369
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
And then, we will obliterate
the Eye of the Midnight Sun!

Now listen carefully,

[KING CLOVER]
Success!

00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:49,500

the idea and took care

00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:53,208
of all the research, but I'm
still getting the credit!

379

[ASTA] Why's the King
picking people, though?

380
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,583
Shouldn't the Wizard King
handle all that stuff?

381
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:00,416
I mean, he knows more
about the Magic Knights

382
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,791
than the king does, plus
everybody likes him more.

383
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:06,375
Think about it. The Wizard King
does cool stuff all the time,

384
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:09,541
and I never heard of King Clover
doin' anything that great.

385

I dunno.

So he's got this
super-awesome magic power,

388
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:16,916
but he's never used it to make
life better for the kingdom?

389
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,291
Is that right?

390
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:19,625
[YUNO]
Yeah, I guess so.

391
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,750
I dunno, maybe it's 'cause
I don't have any powers,

392

so tell me if I'm
missin' the point here.

But I gotta say,
from where I'm standin',

394
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:26,583
it kinda seems to me
like the king

395
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:27,750
is totally pointless and dumb.

and read the room.

comments to yourself.

I want them dead!

I do apologize for their
impertinence, Your Majesty.

412
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:11,583
However, for my sake,
I must implore you

413
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:14,583
to find it in your heart
to pardon this transgression.

414

After all, they may turn
out to be the shield

that protects you from
an attack one of these days.

Besides, this is
a trivial matter.

417

Best not throw
your weight around.

418
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:27,500
It'll cheapen your
royal authority.

Now, Royal Knights!
I expect great things!

420

a Green Praying Mantis,

468
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:16,500
Oh, no.

469
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:18,833
I just can't get
that drawing right!

470
00:23:18,916 --> 00:23:21,083
Hey, Rill! What are you up to?

471
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:22,458
Well, the king wanted me to draw

472
00:23:22,541 --> 00:23:24,791
a caricature for him,
which is an honor and all.

473
00:23:24,875 --> 00:23:27,333
But no matter what I do,
it keeps coming out all wrong!

474
00:23:27,416 --> 00:23:30,583
Wow, I guess even the best
artists have bad days, huh?

475
00:23:30,666 --> 00:23:32,083
I've been sitting
here forever waiting

476
00:23:32,166 --> 00:23:34,166
for some inspiration
to land on me.

477
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,166
But even if I use
an abstract style,

478
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:39,208
his face is just so boring!

479
00:23:39,291 --> 00:23:40,833
Let me see it.

480
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:43,708
[ASTA]
This is awesome.

481
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:48,916
[ASTA] Who's that scary
lady we just met?

482
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,166
Huh? Captain Fuegoleon's
big sister?

483
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:53,125
<i>Black Clover</i> , Page 71:

484
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:55,500
"The Uncrowned,
Undefeated Lioness."

485
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:58,000
I haven't said this in a while,
so I'll give it my best shot.

486
00:23:58,083 --> 00:24:00,208
"My magic is never giving up!"
