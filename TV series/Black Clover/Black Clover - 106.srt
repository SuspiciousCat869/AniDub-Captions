1
00:00:23,763 --> 00:00:25,682
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:25,765 --> 00:00:28,601
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:32,105 --> 00:00:34,357
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:34,441 --> 00:00:37,110
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:43,533 --> 00:00:45,535
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:45,618 --> 00:00:49,748
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:52,417 --> 00:00:54,461
I'm gonna use all of my magic!

8
00:00:54,544 --> 00:00:56,546
Then everything'll be destroyed.

9
00:00:56,629 --> 00:00:59,549
You, the rest of these
humans, and even me!

10
00:00:59,632 --> 00:01:01,676
I want all of you
revolting humans

11
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,387
to disappear for good!

12
00:01:04,471 --> 00:01:06,473
[ASTA]
What's goin' on with his ki?

13
00:01:06,556 --> 00:01:09,392
[NARRATOR] Luck had been
reincarnated as a vengeful elf,

14
00:01:09,476 --> 00:01:12,103
bent on devastating
the human race.

15
00:01:12,187 --> 00:01:15,982
[LUCK] That's why...
I swear I'll make you pay!

16
00:01:16,066 --> 00:01:18,318
[ASTA] I don't know what
you're talkin' about,

17
00:01:18,401 --> 00:01:21,446
but if humans are to blame
for what happened, I'm sorry!

18
00:01:21,529 --> 00:01:23,490
I really mean it!

19
00:01:23,573 --> 00:01:27,035
But Luck, he's precious
to us! We're friends!

20
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:29,245
And we wouldn't ever
wanna lose him!

21
00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:32,832
So please, don't take him away!

22
00:01:32,916 --> 00:01:34,042
That's right!

23
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:36,670
Let go of him before
it's too late!

24
00:01:36,753 --> 00:01:38,672
[ASTA] I'm sure the people
you cared about wouldn't

25
00:01:38,755 --> 00:01:40,298
want you to make
someone else go through

26
00:01:40,382 --> 00:01:43,093
that same pain
you did back then!

27
00:01:43,176 --> 00:01:44,219
[LUCK screaming]

28
00:01:44,302 --> 00:01:45,762
Get out!

29
00:01:45,845 --> 00:01:49,516
[LUCK screams]

30
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:51,643
[NARRATOR] As Asta, Vanessa,
and Magna struggled

31
00:01:51,726 --> 00:01:54,187
to bring Luck back,
their bonds of friendship

32
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,189
were felt once again.

33
00:01:58,942 --> 00:02:01,027
[LUCK]
Um.

34
00:02:01,111 --> 00:02:05,824
Guys. Tell me. Can...

35
00:02:05,907 --> 00:02:10,620
Can I still be...
in the Black Bulls?

36
00:02:13,248 --> 00:02:15,250
What are you talkin' about, kid?

37
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:17,419
'Course you can.

38
00:02:17,502 --> 00:02:22,465
[sobbing]

39
00:03:56,226 --> 00:04:03,566
[BLACK BULLS yelling]

40
00:04:05,318 --> 00:04:08,655
[BLACK BULLS]
Let's go!

41
00:04:08,738 --> 00:04:10,573
[NARRATOR] Asta, Magna,
Vanessa, and the recently

42
00:04:10,657 --> 00:04:13,576
rescued Luck reunited
with Gordon, Grey, Charmy,

43
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,037
and their newly discovered
squadmate, Henry.

44
00:04:16,121 --> 00:04:18,331
Then, the group boarded
the Raging Black Bull

45
00:04:18,415 --> 00:04:20,291
and raced toward the capital.

46
00:04:21,876 --> 00:04:23,586
Asta!

47
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:26,214
There are three elves
in that town ahead.

48
00:04:32,721 --> 00:04:35,348
Huh. How pathetic.

49
00:04:35,432 --> 00:04:37,434
This town was so glorious.

50
00:04:37,517 --> 00:04:39,894
Now it's just a pile of debris.

51
00:04:39,978 --> 00:04:41,980
They'll all be dead soon.

52
00:04:44,691 --> 00:04:48,570
[CHILD 106A sobbing]
Mommy! Daddy!

53
00:04:48,653 --> 00:04:51,948
It's no use. They're too strong!

54
00:04:52,032 --> 00:04:53,491
Why, Lord Xerx?

55
00:04:53,575 --> 00:04:55,660
I don't understand this.

56
00:04:55,744 --> 00:04:57,162
Why would the Saint of Pure Ice

57
00:04:57,245 --> 00:04:58,913
hurt the ones
he's meant to help?

58
00:04:58,997 --> 00:05:01,624
If Magic Knights
are turning on us,

59
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:05,378
there's no hope left
for the Clover Kingdom!

60
00:05:05,462 --> 00:05:10,884
Sol... I failed. I couldn't
protect the town.

61
00:05:10,967 --> 00:05:14,721
But still. I refuse to
give up until the very end!

62
00:05:14,804 --> 00:05:17,599
I'm going to purify
everything now.

63
00:05:17,682 --> 00:05:22,645
Including you filthy
humans. Ice Magic... Hm?

64
00:05:22,729 --> 00:05:23,980
[RISAKKA]
What's wrong?

65
00:05:24,064 --> 00:05:25,774
[XERX]
Something's approaching.

66
00:05:27,734 --> 00:05:30,695
[XERX]
What is that? An enemy?

67
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:34,240
Hah. They can try whatever
weak defenses they want,

68
00:05:34,324 --> 00:05:36,368
but they will never
succeed against us!

69
00:05:36,451 --> 00:05:39,788
Stone Magic: Ground Wall!

70
00:05:44,376 --> 00:05:46,544
[crash]

71
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,341
[XERX]
How?

72
00:05:51,424 --> 00:05:54,886
[BLACK BULLS yelling]

73
00:05:54,969 --> 00:05:57,931
Recombination... Magic...

74
00:05:58,014 --> 00:05:59,432
[HENRY]
Recombination Magic:

75
00:05:59,516 --> 00:06:02,602
Raging Black Bull, Combat Style!

76
00:06:05,146 --> 00:06:06,815
Is that a bull?

77
00:06:06,898 --> 00:06:08,274
Yes.

78
00:06:09,567 --> 00:06:10,902
Rescue!

79
00:06:13,405 --> 00:06:14,572
I gotcha!

80
00:06:17,659 --> 00:06:19,369
Transformation Magic:

81
00:06:19,452 --> 00:06:23,248
Magic Conversion, Ice to Water!

82
00:06:23,331 --> 00:06:25,291
Stone to Sand!

83
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:27,002
[CHILD 106A]
I was so scared!

84
00:06:27,085 --> 00:06:28,628
Thanks for your help, miss!

85
00:06:28,712 --> 00:06:30,463
[GREY]
Don't mention it!

86
00:06:30,547 --> 00:06:33,508
And please, can you
stop looking at me?

87
00:06:33,591 --> 00:06:36,761
That robe. She must
be a Black Bull.

88
00:06:36,845 --> 00:06:42,684
[BLACK BULLS yelling]

89
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:47,105
Don't get a big head, humans.

90
00:06:47,188 --> 00:06:49,816
I'm about to destroy
that hunk of garbage!

91
00:06:49,899 --> 00:06:52,902
[RISAKKA]
Water Magic: Surging Waves!

92
00:06:52,986 --> 00:06:56,364
[PROTOBE]
Stone Magic: Rising Ground!

93
00:06:58,074 --> 00:06:59,492
It's not working!

94
00:06:59,576 --> 00:07:01,619
It's diverting
our spells somehow.

95
00:07:01,703 --> 00:07:04,039
I wish you two would
stop wasting time.

96
00:07:04,122 --> 00:07:07,250
Ice Magic: Ice Slicer!

97
00:07:11,421 --> 00:07:13,381
What? What happened?

98
00:07:15,508 --> 00:07:17,177
[meows]

99
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,721
As long as I've still
got some magic left,

100
00:07:19,804 --> 00:07:22,223
the Black Bulls
will not be harmed!

101
00:07:22,307 --> 00:07:24,309
[CHARMY] Munch, munch, munch,
munch, munch, munch...

102
00:07:24,392 --> 00:07:29,105
Okay! Here... we... go!

103
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:34,819
Flame Magic: Gargantuan
Exploding Fireball!

104
00:07:34,903 --> 00:07:37,072
And how about some
Lightning Magic:

105
00:07:37,155 --> 00:07:38,865
Thunderbolt Destruction!

106
00:07:38,948 --> 00:07:42,952
Poison Magic: Forbidden Fruit!

107
00:07:43,036 --> 00:07:44,454
[MAGNA]
We're combinin' all three

108
00:07:44,537 --> 00:07:46,581
of our offensive abilities...

109
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,251
[LUCK, MAGNA, GORDON]
...to crush you!

110
00:07:56,716 --> 00:07:58,134
All right!

111
00:07:58,218 --> 00:07:59,886
It looks like the shut-in's
really got some skills, huh?

112
00:07:59,969 --> 00:08:01,179
Good job, Henry!

113
00:08:01,262 --> 00:08:02,472
I'm proud!

114
00:08:02,555 --> 00:08:05,975
So proud that I've already
made a doll for him!

115
00:08:06,059 --> 00:08:11,564
That's because... I... know
my friends... so well.

116
00:08:11,648 --> 00:08:16,152
We're... squadmates.
So that's... important!

117
00:08:16,236 --> 00:08:19,322
[HENRY] Finally, I get
to fight with the others!

118
00:08:19,406 --> 00:08:20,657
I'm so glad!

119
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,118
[BLACK BULLS]
Do it, Henry!

120
00:08:23,201 --> 00:08:26,329
I've had quite enough
of your foolishness!

121
00:08:26,413 --> 00:08:28,415
[RISAKKA]
You might manage to dodge this.

122
00:08:28,498 --> 00:08:30,792
[XERX]
But the town won't survive!

123
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:33,294
[GROUP]
Farewell, humans! Combo Magic--

124
00:08:33,378 --> 00:08:34,629
[BLACK BULLS]
Asta Cannon!

125
00:08:34,713 --> 00:08:38,925
[ASTA yells]

126
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:49,310
[ASTA]
Aw, yeah!

127
00:08:49,394 --> 00:08:52,272
You don't ever mess
with the Black Bulls!

128
00:08:52,355 --> 00:08:54,315
We're invincible!

129
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:15,462
[WILLIAM] I felt it for
as long as I can remember.

130
00:09:15,545 --> 00:09:18,590
Someone else was lying
dormant within me.

131
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:23,094
[WILLIAM] I got the sense that
they were badly wounded,

132
00:09:23,178 --> 00:09:28,683
insatiably angry, and
overwhelmingly sad all at once.

133
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,020
[WILLIAM] And so...

134
00:09:32,103 --> 00:09:36,608
I began to feel a responsibility
to protect that weak being.

135
00:09:36,691 --> 00:09:40,862
Because I knew that my
body wasn't just mine.

136
00:09:40,945 --> 00:09:44,115
Because I understood
they were always with me.

137
00:09:44,199 --> 00:09:46,117
That's why

138
00:09:46,201 --> 00:09:48,244
I was able to make it
through such a lonely

139
00:09:48,328 --> 00:09:50,955
and painful childhood.

140
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:55,669
[WILLIAM] About the time
I turned nine years old,

141
00:09:55,752 --> 00:09:58,463
I started having
a recurring dream.

142
00:09:58,546 --> 00:10:01,841
A dream about much happier days.

143
00:10:01,925 --> 00:10:05,553
It turned out, those
were your memories.

144
00:10:09,349 --> 00:10:12,894
[WILLIAM] But it ended
in disloyalty, despair,

145
00:10:12,977 --> 00:10:14,896
and bitter hatred.

146
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,024
[WILLIAM]
I believed that it was up to me

147
00:10:18,108 --> 00:10:21,569
to make sure you were safe.

148
00:10:21,653 --> 00:10:27,409
[WILLIAM] And then, when
I was 13, I met Julius.

149
00:10:27,492 --> 00:10:31,413
[JULIUS] William! I want you
to join the Magic Knights!

150
00:10:31,496 --> 00:10:34,207
[WILLIAM] He was strange,
but he was the first person

151
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:37,002
to acknowledge me.

152
00:10:37,085 --> 00:10:39,671
Oh. Right, I suppose
you won't be receiving

153
00:10:39,754 --> 00:10:41,798
your grimoire until you turn 15,

154
00:10:41,881 --> 00:10:43,717
so I'll just keep dropping
by from time to time

155
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,802
until that happens.

156
00:10:45,885 --> 00:10:48,888
[WILLIAM]
He was kind. I looked up to him.

157
00:10:48,972 --> 00:10:53,143
I have no doubt that you'll
be a spectacular Magic Knight.

158
00:10:53,226 --> 00:10:56,521
[WILLIAM] Then, when
I was 16, you awakened.

159
00:10:56,604 --> 00:10:57,897
[PATRY]
What is this place?

160
00:10:57,981 --> 00:10:59,482
What happened to me?

161
00:10:59,566 --> 00:11:02,569
I thought I was dead.

162
00:11:02,652 --> 00:11:04,487
[WILLIAM] Around that time,
I was a newcomer

163
00:11:04,571 --> 00:11:06,197
affiliated with the Gray Deer,

164
00:11:06,281 --> 00:11:09,993
the Magic Knight squad
led by Julius.

165
00:11:10,076 --> 00:11:12,495
When you also received
your grimoire,

166
00:11:12,579 --> 00:11:15,290
it confirmed the suspicion
I'd always held.

167
00:11:15,373 --> 00:11:17,292
That you and I were
two separate souls

168
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,836
inhabiting the same body.

169
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:22,339
Eventually, we became
able to communicate

170
00:11:22,422 --> 00:11:24,215
our thoughts telepathically.

171
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:27,135
and we could even swap
souls with each other.

172
00:11:28,803 --> 00:11:30,638
[WILLIAM] I soon learned
that you had a mission

173
00:11:30,722 --> 00:11:33,808
you were set on
completing at any cost.

174
00:11:33,892 --> 00:11:36,561
And for that, I would have
to betray the other person

175
00:11:36,644 --> 00:11:42,108
closest to me, as well as
the kingdom I called home.

176
00:11:42,192 --> 00:11:44,235
I was forced to
choose between you,

177
00:11:44,319 --> 00:11:46,279
the one with whom I'd
shared everything as though

178
00:11:46,363 --> 00:11:48,656
we were twins, and
the admirable leader

179
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,700
of the Magic Knights,
the man who'd taught me

180
00:11:50,784 --> 00:11:52,577
how to live my life.

181
00:11:53,995 --> 00:11:57,624
[WILLIAM] It was an impossibly
difficult decision to make,

182
00:11:57,707 --> 00:11:59,334
but the longer I debated,

183
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:03,380
the more of my
comrades were hurt.

184
00:12:03,463 --> 00:12:06,383
In the end, I failed
to commit either way,

185
00:12:06,466 --> 00:12:09,469
and I let both of you
choose the outcome.

186
00:12:09,552 --> 00:12:15,183
I'm a monster. You
got what you wanted.

187
00:12:15,266 --> 00:12:20,105
I'm sorry, Julius.
Patry, you won.

188
00:12:21,147 --> 00:12:23,775
[WILLIAM] And now, since
you've finally achieved

189
00:12:23,858 --> 00:12:28,530
your ambition, this is
where we part ways.

190
00:12:28,613 --> 00:12:32,951
So, goodbye, Patry.
And, maybe...

191
00:12:37,664 --> 00:12:40,375
I must've expended
too much power.

192
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:44,671
Was I asleep? How long?

193
00:12:44,754 --> 00:12:49,134
My own reincarnation has
been completed at last.

194
00:12:49,217 --> 00:12:54,347
Which means William has fallen
into an endless slumber.

195
00:12:54,431 --> 00:12:59,853
Thank you, to the only human
I could call my friend.

196
00:12:59,936 --> 00:13:03,857
William. Goodbye.

197
00:13:07,152 --> 00:13:08,820
[PATRY] At this point,
there is no longer

198
00:13:08,903 --> 00:13:11,281
any human I cannot kill.

199
00:13:12,741 --> 00:13:14,617
[PATRY] Licht and Rhya should
be making their way

200
00:13:14,701 --> 00:13:17,120
into the royal capital by now.

201
00:13:17,203 --> 00:13:19,456
I'd better make haste.

202
00:13:19,539 --> 00:13:24,336
Clover Castle, the place where
we will exact our revenge.

203
00:13:24,419 --> 00:13:27,714
The royals are
concentrated there.

204
00:13:27,797 --> 00:13:30,800
And they're the humans
we despise most.

205
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:41,978
[RADES grunts]

206
00:13:42,062 --> 00:13:46,733
[screams]

207
00:13:46,816 --> 00:13:48,610
[NARRATOR]
In the moment he was revived,

208
00:13:48,693 --> 00:13:51,654
the fear for his life,
combined with immense hatred,

209
00:13:51,738 --> 00:13:53,782
caused Rades' magic
to grow to a point

210
00:13:53,865 --> 00:13:56,576
that he could do more
than control the dead.

211
00:13:56,659 --> 00:13:59,788
What resulted was the perfection
of true wraith magic.

212
00:13:59,871 --> 00:14:02,707
An evolved technique that
was just barely capable

213
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:05,543
of taking souls that were
about to be sacrificed

214
00:14:05,627 --> 00:14:08,338
and reincarnating them
into their bodies.

215
00:14:08,421 --> 00:14:12,258
[RADES screams]

216
00:14:12,342 --> 00:14:15,261
[RADES]
Licht!

217
00:14:15,345 --> 00:14:16,846
How could you dare deceive me

218
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:18,264
and convince me
to do your bidding,

219
00:14:18,348 --> 00:14:21,976
only to slaughter and
cast me aside? Curse you.

220
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:25,438
I'll make you pay for this,
if it's the last thing I do!

221
00:14:25,522 --> 00:14:28,066
You two! Rise n' shine!

222
00:14:29,734 --> 00:14:35,156
[RADES] Valtos! Sally!
What a lucky break.

223
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,617
I almost couldn't
bring you guys back.

224
00:14:37,701 --> 00:14:41,287
Now let's kill him together!

225
00:14:43,456 --> 00:14:47,877
[ASTA] We did it! All three
of 'em are back to normal!

226
00:14:47,961 --> 00:14:50,922
[BLACK BULLS]
All right!

227
00:14:53,216 --> 00:14:57,303
Spatial magic? You three!

228
00:14:57,387 --> 00:14:58,847
What do you want?

229
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:04,644
Ah, the Black Bulls again.
I'm here for my revenge.

230
00:15:04,728 --> 00:15:06,730
And you're gonna help me get it.

231
00:15:06,813 --> 00:15:08,732
[GREY]
Oh, no, it's them!

232
00:15:08,815 --> 00:15:11,401
[GORDON] They're the people
who tore down our hideout!

233
00:15:11,484 --> 00:15:12,944
Oh, is that so?

234
00:15:13,028 --> 00:15:14,696
Then you must be
the ones responsible

235
00:15:14,779 --> 00:15:17,115
for the death of my poor,
innocent vegetables!

236
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:20,618
Wasting perfectly good food
is a serious crime around here!

237
00:15:20,702 --> 00:15:24,247
Be quiet! You get
on my nerves, too.

238
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:27,500
But my first priority is killing
off that bastard Licht.

239
00:15:27,584 --> 00:15:29,044
[ASTA]
Huh?

240
00:15:29,127 --> 00:15:31,963
[RADES] He tricked me.
He tricked all of us.

241
00:15:32,047 --> 00:15:34,841
Just so that he could use us
to serve his own purposes,

242
00:15:34,924 --> 00:15:36,301
and then he threw
us away like trash

243
00:15:36,384 --> 00:15:39,012
as soon as he didn't
need us anymore!

244
00:15:39,095 --> 00:15:41,014
He should pay for
what he's done,

245
00:15:41,097 --> 00:15:44,601
and I won't rest until
we even the score!

246
00:15:44,684 --> 00:15:47,354
Licht headed for
the royal capital.

247
00:15:47,437 --> 00:15:50,398
I'm assuming he's already there.

248
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:52,859
If we use Sally's Dark
Magic items to enhance

249
00:15:52,942 --> 00:15:56,029
Valtos's Spatial Magic,
we'll be able to transport

250
00:15:56,112 --> 00:15:59,240
this moving base of
yours pretty quickly.

251
00:15:59,324 --> 00:16:03,036
We can be there
before ya know it.

252
00:16:03,119 --> 00:16:04,162
You're on your way

253
00:16:04,245 --> 00:16:06,539
to the royal capital,
too, aren't you?

254
00:16:06,623 --> 00:16:08,833
It sounds like we all have
the same objective here,

255
00:16:08,917 --> 00:16:11,336
so we might as well
work together.

256
00:16:11,419 --> 00:16:14,005
Not a bad deal, right?

257
00:16:14,089 --> 00:16:16,049
[RADES]
Hope you're ready, Licht.

258
00:16:16,132 --> 00:16:18,927
You're as good as dead now!

259
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:21,179
Judging by the mana,
it feels like all of the elves

260
00:16:21,262 --> 00:16:23,306
are trying to gather
in the capital, too.

261
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,974
Wait a minute.

262
00:16:25,058 --> 00:16:26,559
It's kinda sketchy
to me that this guy

263
00:16:26,643 --> 00:16:30,563
suddenly showed up
askin' us for help.

264
00:16:30,647 --> 00:16:33,191
Hah! Well. Looks like
we've got ourse--

265
00:16:33,274 --> 00:16:34,984
No way!

266
00:16:35,068 --> 00:16:36,569
[RADES]
Huh?!

267
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:41,032
What the hell is wrong with you?

268
00:16:41,116 --> 00:16:43,118
[ASTA] You think we're
after the same thing?

269
00:16:43,201 --> 00:16:44,744
You better think again!

270
00:16:44,828 --> 00:16:47,539
All we're tryin' to do
is protect everyone!

271
00:16:47,622 --> 00:16:50,291
We're not doin' it
to get revenge!

272
00:16:51,418 --> 00:16:53,044
[ASTA]
And what's worse.

273
00:16:53,128 --> 00:16:54,421
You're the guy who
attacked all those

274
00:16:54,504 --> 00:16:55,922
innocent people in the capital.

275
00:16:56,006 --> 00:16:58,174
Did you think we
forgot about that?

276
00:16:58,258 --> 00:16:59,384
'Cause we didn't!

277
00:16:59,467 --> 00:17:01,594
And you have the nerve
to ask us for help?

278
00:17:01,678 --> 00:17:03,388
You're barkin' up
the wrong tree, pal!

279
00:17:03,471 --> 00:17:05,974
You don't deserve
revenge, you dummy!

280
00:17:06,057 --> 00:17:08,268
You need to make up
for what you did!

281
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:10,145
And you can start
off by helpin' us

282
00:17:10,228 --> 00:17:12,480
save the Clover Kingdom!

283
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:14,024
[yelps] Are you kidding me?

284
00:17:14,107 --> 00:17:15,275
There's no way
I'm gonna do that!

285
00:17:15,358 --> 00:17:17,235
Does it look like I'm
playin' around to you?

286
00:17:17,318 --> 00:17:18,862
[screams]

287
00:17:18,945 --> 00:17:21,156
No arguments!
We're in a hurry here,

288
00:17:21,239 --> 00:17:24,367
so help us get to the
capital, right now!

289
00:17:24,451 --> 00:17:26,786
[RADES] Who died and put
you in charge, pipsqueak?

290
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:29,289
This isn't a fair deal
at all! I won't do it!

291
00:17:29,372 --> 00:17:30,707
[ASTA]
You got no choice!

292
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,625
I won't let you go
till you agree!

293
00:17:32,709 --> 00:17:35,128
[RADES]
Damn, how are you so strong?!

294
00:17:35,211 --> 00:17:36,755
[LUCK]
That's our Asta.

295
00:17:36,838 --> 00:17:38,214
Look at him squirm!

296
00:17:38,298 --> 00:17:40,800
That's it, show him
what's what, Asta!

297
00:17:40,884 --> 00:17:42,802
[LUCK] Hang on.
We've already got a ride,

298
00:17:42,886 --> 00:17:45,055
so do we actually need that guy?

299
00:17:45,138 --> 00:17:46,014
[MAGNA]
Not sure.

300
00:17:46,097 --> 00:17:46,973
[RADES]
Huh?

301
00:17:47,057 --> 00:17:48,892
That's a good point, Luck.

302
00:17:48,975 --> 00:17:51,478
I guess I'll just have to make
a deal with the other two!

303
00:17:51,561 --> 00:17:52,645
Wait, no!

304
00:17:52,729 --> 00:17:55,982
So, uh, what do you
guys think of that?

305
00:17:56,066 --> 00:17:57,859
Well, I...

306
00:17:57,942 --> 00:18:00,612
I just want to see Master Licht

307
00:18:00,695 --> 00:18:03,573
so that I can
determine the truth.

308
00:18:03,656 --> 00:18:06,743
Therefore, I will accompany you.

309
00:18:06,826 --> 00:18:09,204
After all, if
everything Master Licht

310
00:18:09,287 --> 00:18:12,916
said was a lie, then I
really am a sinner.

311
00:18:12,999 --> 00:18:17,629
Which means I need
to seek atonement.

312
00:18:17,712 --> 00:18:19,964
Thanks for nothin', Valtos!

313
00:18:20,048 --> 00:18:23,259
What about you, Sally? You wanna
get revenge, too, don't you?

314
00:18:23,343 --> 00:18:26,471
I don't have my glasses,
so I can't see too well.

315
00:18:26,554 --> 00:18:28,139
[RADES]
But you can hear, can't you?

316
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:29,391
Let me think here.

317
00:18:29,474 --> 00:18:31,476
The reason I joined
Master Licht was because

318
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:33,895
he let me do whatever
experiments I wanted,

319
00:18:33,978 --> 00:18:36,648
and Magic Knights
always get in my way.

320
00:18:36,731 --> 00:18:38,983
Then again, I guess
I am happy to be alive

321
00:18:39,067 --> 00:18:41,236
so I can continue my research.

322
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:43,238
Oh, and I saw lots
of interesting stuff

323
00:18:43,321 --> 00:18:44,739
while I was dying,
so I might be close

324
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:46,116
to a breakthrough!

325
00:18:46,199 --> 00:18:47,742
I was the one who
brought you back to life,

326
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:49,786
in case you didn't realize!

327
00:18:49,869 --> 00:18:51,621
[SALLY]
Oh, okay. Thanks, Rades.

328
00:18:51,705 --> 00:18:53,123
[RADES groans]

329
00:18:53,206 --> 00:18:56,042
Hey! You wanted to
experiment on me, right?

330
00:18:56,126 --> 00:18:57,836
If you help us stop the
Eye of the Midnight Sun

331
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,004
and protect the Clover Kingdom,

332
00:18:59,087 --> 00:19:00,880
then I'll be your
number-one test subject!

333
00:19:00,964 --> 00:19:04,718
Huh? Wow, you mean it?
That's awesome!

334
00:19:04,801 --> 00:19:07,220
But you can't do anything
that's gonna hurt me really bad!

335
00:19:07,303 --> 00:19:08,221
Aw.

336
00:19:08,304 --> 00:19:10,306
Don't "Aw" at me!

337
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:12,100
Come on, as long as
you don't hurt anybody,

338
00:19:12,183 --> 00:19:13,518
you'll be free to do
as much science

339
00:19:13,601 --> 00:19:15,478
as your little heart desires!

340
00:19:15,562 --> 00:19:17,105
In fact, if you're doin'
research that makes

341
00:19:17,188 --> 00:19:20,525
the world better, we'll be there
to support you 100 percent!

342
00:19:20,608 --> 00:19:22,527
That would make you happy,
too, wouldn't it?

343
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:24,112
Uh.

344
00:19:24,195 --> 00:19:27,532
I'm kinda confused, but if
I get to keep researching,

345
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:29,534
then that's what I wanna do!

346
00:19:29,617 --> 00:19:30,910
[ASTA]
Sounds good!

347
00:19:30,994 --> 00:19:33,413
And you don't need anesthesia
when I cut you up?

348
00:19:33,496 --> 00:19:34,622
Yes, I do!

349
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:36,916
Did you not hear anything
I just told you?

350
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,086
If not for me, you'd still be
dead as a doornail right now!

351
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:41,796
[CHARMY]
Mulling it over?

352
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,173
Indeed.

353
00:19:43,256 --> 00:19:46,217
Poor thing.
You must be starving.

354
00:19:46,301 --> 00:19:47,886
Have some food!

355
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:55,185
Tastes... so good!
It's restoring my magic!

356
00:19:55,268 --> 00:19:57,520
[SALLY]
What? That's so cool!

357
00:19:57,604 --> 00:20:00,190
I'm hungry, too,
let me have some, please!

358
00:20:00,273 --> 00:20:02,567
No one can fight
on an empty tummy!

359
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:04,486
Now start eating!

360
00:20:05,862 --> 00:20:07,364
It's delicious!

361
00:20:07,447 --> 00:20:10,492
Makes me feel like I could
dissect things all day!

362
00:20:10,575 --> 00:20:13,078
--So about that anesthesia.
--[stomach growls]

363
00:20:13,161 --> 00:20:15,246
But... this isn't fair!

364
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:16,498
There's plenty more!

365
00:20:16,581 --> 00:20:18,375
Is this food makin'
you guys wanna defend

366
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:19,501
the Clover Kingdom with us?

367
00:20:19,584 --> 00:20:21,002
Go on, chow down!

368
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:25,006
After a nap like that, you must
have a big appetite! Eat!

369
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,008
[RADES groaning]

370
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:28,760
The only thing better
than eating with friends

371
00:20:28,843 --> 00:20:31,638
is eating food that replenishes
your magic power with friends.

372
00:20:31,721 --> 00:20:34,724
I've got the energy to take
on anyone in the world!

373
00:20:34,808 --> 00:20:35,975
[GREY]
Why are you still debating?

374
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:38,269
This food is so tasty,
you should be convinced!

375
00:20:38,353 --> 00:20:41,314
[MAGNA] Best thing ever!
You gotta try it, dude!

376
00:20:41,398 --> 00:20:43,733
Oh, yeah! Wow! I've never
been this motivated!

377
00:20:43,817 --> 00:20:48,113
[HENRY]
So... good! It's... amazing!

378
00:20:48,196 --> 00:20:49,823
[VANESSA]
What a time to be alive!

379
00:20:49,906 --> 00:20:51,908
Especially if you
were just dead.

380
00:20:51,991 --> 00:20:53,868
That's true, only
the living can enjoy

381
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:57,038
a big bowl of
yummy food. Ya know?

382
00:20:59,582 --> 00:21:01,376
[RADES]
Fine, you win!

383
00:21:01,459 --> 00:21:03,962
We'll go with your squad
to the royal capital!

384
00:21:04,045 --> 00:21:05,171
But don't think that means

385
00:21:05,255 --> 00:21:07,424
you get to tell me what
to do, you understand?

386
00:21:07,507 --> 00:21:09,300
I do what I want!

387
00:21:09,384 --> 00:21:12,012
[ASTA] Except you literally just
did what I asked you to do!

388
00:21:12,095 --> 00:21:13,722
Get over it already, man!

389
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:15,640

00:21:19,477 --> 00:21:22,313
there's plenty more food
where that came from!

393

[ASTA]
Hurry!

394
00:21:25,108 --> 00:21:27,402
The faster you eat,
the sooner we can head out!

395
00:21:27,485 --> 00:21:30,530
Once your magic comes back,
we'll be off to the capital!

Take this!

I'll start things off
with a little Clover Twist!

406

And then I'll follow it up
with a Reverse Clover Hold!

Throw in a Clover Backbreaker!
