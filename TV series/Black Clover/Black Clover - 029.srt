Threatened by a ruthless demon,

00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:07,208
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

5
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:09,583
All seemed lost
until a lone mage

stepped forward and
took up the fight.

7
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:15,041
After his triumph, he was hailed

8
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:19,416
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

[NARRATOR] Time flowed
onward into the present.

11
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:35,666
The role of Wizard King was
passed down through the ages,

12
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,458
and always, he and the
Magic Knights under his command

have fought to keep
the kingdom safe.

The Magic Knights:

nine squads of

00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,291
are specialized for combat,

17
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:51,916
operating under the direct
control of the Wizard King.

18
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,916
[NARRATOR] These heroic men
and women risk their lives

to protect their country. For
their bravery and dedication,

20

the Magic Knights
and the Wizard King

21

Yuno won't win.

I'm gonna beat him

And when I'm the Wizard King,

33
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,791
I'll come back
for you, Sister Lily.

[TOWERMASTER] That Asta
is just full of surprises.

00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,333
The boy who barely
got a grimoire

38
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,625
is a regular Magic Knight
success story.

00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:29,041
I'm glad to hear
he's doing well.

40
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:32,000
They've both come so far
in their young lives.

41
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:33,833
Abandoned on the
doorstep when they were

only babies, and now
look at them!

43
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,041
With the money they've
sent home every month,

44
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:39,166
we've fixed up the church

45
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,958
and laid in enough
pop-potatoes to keep

full this winter!

Huh? Are you sure?

[TOWERMASTER] In this world,
magic is everything.

52
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:01,916
So what could ever become
of a boy who has none?

53
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:06,833
[TOWERMASTER]
Now, never once has anyone

from this region
distinguished him, or herself,

55
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,750
by becoming a Magic Knight,
much less the Wizard King.

56
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:15,583
I pray that one among you
will have what it takes

to become the most
powerful mage in the land.

The final and most difficult.

112

A display of combat skill.

113
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:51,958
As knights, battle
is our business.

We wanna see everything
you're capable of!

115
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:56,833
[ASTA] The best way to
show off now is to pair off

116
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:59,291
with someone strong.

117
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:01,958

you and I pair up?

You really mean it, Sekke?

You're willing to take on
a charity case like me?

We're both working
for the same goal.

121
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:13,166
So we'll have a fair fight,

122
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,333
but nobody pulls
any punches, okay?

123

Now, begin.

No pulling punches, remember?

I'm not joining

135
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:57,458
the Magic Knights just
so I can slack off

and have a little fun.

137

I've got a much bigger goal.

00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:05,208
I'm gonna be the Wizard King.

143
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:27,541
This is it. The power of
a Magic Knight captain.

144
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:30,416
What you said before.
That you took the exam

145
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,750
'cause you wanna become
the Wizard King.

146
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:36,708
And now, standing here
magicless and pathetic,

147
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:39,083
can you really say
you have what it takes?

148
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,666
That you're strong enough
to be the Wizard King?

Yeah, fine.

151
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:50,541
So, maybe I won't get to join
a Magic Knight squad today.

152
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:53,250
But no matter what anyone says,

153
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:56,625
and no matter how many
times I might stumble,

154
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,000
I won't give up!

155
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:00,500
I will become the Wizard King!

best if you stayed behind.

321
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:05,500
If your injuries aren't healed--

322
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:06,750
I'll be fine.

323
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:07,791
[KLAUS gasps]

324
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:09,041
[MIMOSA]
It's so sweet of you to put

325
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,666
Yuno's health first like that.

326
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,416
I am not sweet.

327
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,625
Bringing along an injured
man would slow us down,

328
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:15,958
that's all.

329
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:18,583
My concern is for the mission,
not Yuno's health.

330
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:19,708
Let's go.

331
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:23,500
You're not riding?

332
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:27,958
Uh. Well, uh, it's just
more of a broom sort of day,

333
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:29,666
ya know?

334
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,166
[KLAUS]
Don't be shy.

335
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,833
It doesn't use too
much magic power,

336
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:34,375
if that's what you're
worried about.

337
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:36,208
[MIMOSA]
Oh, I'm not being shy.

338
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:38,500
And I'm definitely not
thinking about how embarrassing

339
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:40,916
it would be if my friends
saw me riding in that.

340
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,958
[YUNO]
Yeah.

341
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:43,416
[KLAUS]
Now see here!

342
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,291
Are you two making
fun of my chariot?

343
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:46,708
[YUNO]
Of course not.

344
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:49,125
[KLAUS]
Ah! Hey! Come back!

345
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:51,416
You can't take off
on your own like that!

346
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:56,541
Well, I'll just be
on my way, too, then.

347
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:57,916
Uh--

348
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,500
[YUNO]
I can't waste any time resting.

349
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:04,291
I need to get stronger.

350
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:05,958
Much stronger!

351
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,625
[YUNO] You showed me it
was possible. Gave me hope.

352
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:15,666
That even though we're
poor orphans, commoners,

353
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:19,833
we can still make something
of ourselves in this world.

354
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:21,416
And to prove that...

355
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,833
[ASTA] To make Sister Lily
and everybody else happy...

356
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,666
[ASTA, YUNO] ...we'll fight
to see who will be

357
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,583
the Wizard King.
Whatever it takes.

358
00:23:10,833 --> 00:23:13,083
[FULL CAST]
Clover Clips!

359
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:15,000
[GORDON mumbling]
Clover Clips.

360
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:16,875
[KLAUS]
"It's Not Like I'm Worried."

361
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:22,208
[KLAUS] He's brushing each tooth
carefully and thoroughly,

362
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:24,583
ensuring maximum cleanliness.

363
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:27,291
[KLAUS gasps]
Don't scrub so roughly!

364
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:30,458
[KLAUS]
His eyes!

365
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:31,500
No!

366
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:34,958
Safe.

367
00:23:35,041 --> 00:23:36,291
It's a chilly night.

368
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:38,291
Is he going to catch cold?

369
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:39,541
Um, Klaus, at this point,

370
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:42,041
I'm not sure if it's
sweet or just creepy.

371
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:43,541
Just creepy.

372
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,583
[ASTA]
No work again today?

373
00:23:48,666 --> 00:23:51,291
Feels like all I do
is take time off lately.

374
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:52,708
Guess this would be
a good chance to visit

375
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:54,041
Rebecca and her family.

376
00:23:54,125 --> 00:23:57,041
<i>Black Clover</i> , Page 30:
"The Mirror Mage."

377
00:23:57,125 --> 00:24:00,708
All right! Let's see if
I play as well as I fight!
