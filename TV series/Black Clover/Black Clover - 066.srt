1
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,625
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:18,500
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,583
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:27,250
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:35,666
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,750
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:21,333
[paper rustling]

8
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:24,375
[breathing heavily]

9
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:28,000
As you may be aware,

10
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:30,208
Asta's arms have been
repaired by the Queen

11
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:32,333
who resides within
the Forest of Witches.

12
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:34,250
That's good. I was
so worried about him,

13
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:35,791
I've had trouble slee-- Oh!

14
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:39,541
Wait! No, I haven't!
I've slept just like a baby!

15
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:41,333
Um, what I meant was...

16
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:43,208
I know you've all
been concerned,

17
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:45,125
so now you can rest easy!

18
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:47,625
Please, I'm not concerned
about him in the least.

19
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:49,166
[gasps] Nor am I!

20
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,666
But, sir, you've been
outside every night

21
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,416
dousing yourself with water
and saying prayers.

22
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,333
[KLAUS]
Please restore Asta's arms!

23
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:58,625
Please restore Asta's arms!

24
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:00,625
[gasps] How did you know?

25
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:02,416
I went out to do some
prayers of my own,

26
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,666
but I saw that you
were already there--

27
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,291
Ah-- On second thought,
forget everything I just said.

28
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:08,375
I didn't see you, I promise!

29
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:09,625
Yes, Precisely!

30
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:12,375
And I didn't do
anything absurd either!

31
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:13,916
I don't know--

32
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,708
[KLAUS] Eh-hem! At any rate,
I've called you here to discuss

33
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:18,666
something very important.

34
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,916
My, you're so serious now, sir.

35
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,416
It concerns that
terrorist group.

36
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,791
The Midnight Sun attacked
the Forest of Witches

37
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,875
to acquire the
Queen's magic stone.

38
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,583
Fortunately, they failed.

39
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:34,041
So Asta and his squad
obtained the stone themselves.

40
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:36,916
Asta really is one of a kind!

41
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,166
My point is, it's highly
likely we'll be forced

42
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,833
to contend with them
in the future.

43
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:45,166
So welcome to the Eye of the
Midnight Sun study session!

44
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:49,166
You! Tell us every single detail
you know about the organization!

45
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,083
Everything that
I know? Let me see.

46
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:55,166
There was that surprise
attack on the royal capital.

47
00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:00,250
[CITIZENS screaming]

48
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:06,291
[RADES cackling]

49
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:09,333
[YUNO] We Magic Knights
were called to the scene.

50
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,583
Let's see how you
like this spell.

51
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:14,416
My Flame Magic: Spiral Flames!

52
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,583
Go, Flame Magic: Sol Linea!

Go, Spiral Lance!

54
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:30,250
Glass Creation Magic:
Fleur de Verre.

55
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,583
[HAMON laughs]

56
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:36,291
Sand Creation Magic:
Sand-Armored Guard!

57
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:38,750
Anybody who's been wounded,

58
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:41,000
please come and
see me immediately!

59
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:44,000
[SOL] Earth Creation Magic:
Raging Mother Goddess!

60
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,916
[RAGING MOTHER GODDESS growls]

61
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,625
Not one step further.

62
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:51,458
No one is permitted to touch me.

63
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,458
Briar Creation Magic:

64
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:55,875
Corpse-Hunting Briar Trees!

65
00:04:56,958 --> 00:05:00,208
Water Creation Magic:
Slashing Sea Serpent!

66
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:03,083
[ALL]
Mist Magic: Solid Mist Clones.

67
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:06,166
[NOZEL]
Receive your punishment.

68
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,375
Mercury Magic: Rain of Silver!

69
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:12,291
[NOZEL] This is what happens
to those who dare

70
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:15,833
to rise up against our
land. We crush them.

71
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:20,416
Flame Creation Magic:
Leo Rugiens!

72
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:24,333
Burn to ash!

73
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:25,208
Hey, look!

74
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:26,416
They're so powerful!

75
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,333
Is there anything they can't do?

76
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:31,625
There's just one very important
thing to know about me.

77
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:33,083
The truth is,

78
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,875
I would rather give
my life than lose!

79
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:39,541
Wind Spirit Magic:
Sylph's Breath!

80
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:42,583
[CATHERINE screams]

81
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:45,333
[YUNO] But, what they
were really after

82
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:49,500
belonged to Captain Fuegoleon
of the Crimson Lion Kings.

83
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:54,541
It's you!

84
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:02,666
[ASTA gasps]

85
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,583

86
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:09,000
[NOELLE screams]

87
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:11,791
[JULIUS]
I see.

88
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,666
And we don't know
when he'll wake up?

89
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:17,708
Losing a man like Fuegoleon
would be quite a blow.

90
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:20,458
The consequences
of my misjudgment.

91
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:23,958
No, it's our inexperience
that's to blame.

92
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:25,500
And there's something else.

93
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,458
We discovered that
the pendant Fuegoleon

94
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:29,750
was wearing has disappeared.

95
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:33,750
[JULIUS] The multicolored jewels
embedded in that tablet.

96
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,000
The next time they were spotted,

97
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:42,250
it was close to the
small village of Nean.

98
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:44,666
Asta's group saw them
while on a break.

99
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,750
How bizarre.

100
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:49,208
Asta must be connected
to them by fate!

101
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:53,083
That day, they faced the
group's leader called Licht.

102
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:54,333
And...

103
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:56,083
[LICHT]
I'll introduce you.

104
00:06:56,166 --> 00:07:00,250
These three are the strongest
members of the Midnight Sun.

105
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,875
They are the Third Eye.

106
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:07,875
Antithetical to integrity,
we have Rhya the Disloyal.

107
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:12,375
As the antithesis to hope,
we have Vetto the Despair.

108
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:17,916
And, as the inverse of love,
we have Fana the Hateful.

109
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,375
Now, let's get this over with.

110
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:21,458
Hah!

111
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:22,583
Kill them.

112
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:26,000
Spirit Magic:
Salamander's Breath.

113
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:35,625
[KLAUS] Even Captain Yami
struggled against

114
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:37,958
that trio of powerful mages.

115
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:48,875
You're having way too much fun
on your own here, Yami.

116
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:51,083
You should let the
rest of us in on it.

117
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:52,791
Aw, man.

118
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:55,958
Just when I was about to have
some kinda awakening, too.

119
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:57,416
I would expect somebody who was

120
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,833
in your position to speak
with greater care.

121
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:01,166
How pitiful.

122
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:04,208
You couldn't handle a few
measly mages without us?

123
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:06,000
[KLAUS] But then,
Captain Jack the Ripper

124
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:08,166
of the Green Praying Mantises,

125
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,000
Captain Nozel Silva
of the Silver Eagles,

126
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:12,375
and Captain Charlotte Roselei

127
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:15,125
of the Blue Rose
Knights appeared.

128
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:20,083
Briar Creation Magic:
Corpse-Hunting Briar Trees.

129

Severing Magic: Death Scythe!

130
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:27,541
I've been waiting
for this. Finally!

131
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:31,291
Mercury Magic: Silver Spears!

132

[VETTO yells]

[CHARLOTTE grunts]

134
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:43,458
[YAMI] He's been weakened,
but I'm not gonna

135
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:45,666
risk letting him get away.

136
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:49,125
[LICHT] Ah, yes.
I expected this from you.

137
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:50,875
I'll end you this time.

138
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:53,416
[YAMI] You're goin' after
the boss, too, aren't ya?

139
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,541
All right. Bring it!

140
00:08:57,375 --> 00:09:01,583
My magic is never giving up!

141
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:06,125
[YAMI yells]

142
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,916
[laughs] Gotcha.

143
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,416
So, what'd ya think about
my magic-free smash attack?

144
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:18,791
No!

145
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:20,458
This cannot be!

146
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:23,500
Why do you have that grimoire?

147
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:25,208
Why do you wield them?

148
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:29,333
The demon-slayer sword
and the demon-dweller sword.

149
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:33,708
Those swords belong
to the master!

150
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:35,875
This grimoire and
these swords are mine.

151
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:37,541
I don't care if
they're all beat up!

152
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,416
They're not yours.

153
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,208
Give them back to
their rightful owner!

154
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:48,125
His body isn't going to
hold out much longer.

155
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:49,958
We need to hurry!

156
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:54,083
[VETTO, RHYA, FANA]
Trinity Sealing Magic!

157
00:09:56,291 --> 00:10:00,291
You pushed yourself
too hard this time, Licht.

158
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:02,958
Our boss is feeling
a bit under the weather.

159
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:05,708
So I'm afraid we're gonna
have to call it a day.

160
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:07,958
I promise, when we meet
again I won't leave

161
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,041
until you've tasted
true despair.

162
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:12,958
The next time we meet,
you'll draw your last breath.

163
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:14,500
Remember, wherever you go,

164
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:17,458
the Eye of the Midnight
Sun is watching.

165
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,125
Despite some difficulty,
the Captains fought off

166
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:26,041
Licht and the Third Eye.

167
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,666
[YUNO] If you ask me,
I could've accomplished

168
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,083
that on my own.

169
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:31,916
And I wouldn't get hurt, either.

170
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,791
After that was over,
an investigation revealed

171
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:36,083
why the Midnight Sun wanted

172
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:39,041
Fuegoleon's pendant
so desperately.

173
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:41,583
According to our captives,
they call the gems

174
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:44,500
embedded in that tablet
"magic stones."

175
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,541
They believe that gathering
them will allow them

176
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:49,708
to be reborn into their
"true forms" with close ties

177
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:52,791
to the mana, thereby granting
them immense power.

178
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:55,791
Apparently that was the reason
they targeted Fuegoleon--

179
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:59,208
because of the
magic stone he wore.

180
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,500
Four stones remain
to be gathered.

181
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:02,916
And from what our captives said,

182
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,333
it seems they know the
location of one of them.

183
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:07,166
[YAMI]
Where's that?

184
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,791
[JULIUS]
The Underwater Temple,

185
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,500
one of the "strong
magic regions."

186
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:12,166
Oh, yeah, I understand now.

187
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,708
So we have to get there before
the Eye of the Midnight Sun

188
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:17,958
does and make off with
this magic stone thingy?

189
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:20,083
Thank you, Yami.
I'm counting on you.

190
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:21,375
Oh, and Asta?

191
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:22,875
Yes, sir!

192
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:27,625
[ASTA screams]

193
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,166
I think I felt my heart stop!

194
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:33,375
[YAMI] Never seen someone injure
themselves givin' a salute.

195
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:36,541
And so, the Black Bulls headed
for the Underwater Temple.

196
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:40,583
Asta, again. Why didn't
he ask me instead?

197
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,333
The Wizard King
must've taken a liking

198
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:44,833
to Asta, too, and I can see why.

199
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:46,333
Well, I can't.

200
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:47,958
As soon as the
Black Bulls arrived

201
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:51,416
at the Underwater Temple,
trouble ensued.

202
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,708
They were confronted by a member

203
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,541
of the Third Eye,
the Midnight Sun's

204
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:58,541
three most vicious fighters.
Vetto the Despair.

205
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:00,666
Well, it looks like
you folks are having

206
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,416
quite a get-together.

207
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,458
How about... you guys
let me in the mix?

208
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:17,458
[BOTH]
We won't give up!

209
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,875
We're gonna fight with
everything we've got!

210
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:21,708

[VETTO]
Go on. Howl!

215
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,166
--Embrace your despair!
--[screams]

216
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:48,666
[ASTA] No one ever protected
anybody by giving up!

217
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,375
What?

218
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:53,916
[KAHONO sings]

219
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,166
[NOELLE, KAHONO]
What he said was,

220
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,333
"No one ever protected
anybody by giving up!"

221
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:00,833
[yells]

222
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:05,958
[VETTO] A sparrow's song,
and a waltzing mouse.

223
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:08,250
I wouldn't expect them
to be so powerful.

224
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,041
They have some unique
spells for living

225
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:11,541
in such a remote location.

226
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:12,625
[KIATO]
That's right!

227
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,125
This place is what
shaped our magic!

228
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:18,083
It's been woven into the
very fabric of our lives.

229
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:20,583
Generations of our people
have praised the sea god

230
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,375
with their singing and dancing.

231
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:25,625
[KAHONO] We've been practicing
all of our lives.

232
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:28,833
Each song and each dance is
an offering to the sea god.

233
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:31,291
To him, and to everyone we love!

234
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:34,583
This magic bonds the people
of the Underwater Temple.

235
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:39,500
[KIATO yells]

236

Don't speak such
words to me, girl!

this power come from?

245
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,916
Release my friend at once.

Or you'll regret it!

Hold on. Are you royalty?

00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:55,250
the Black Bulls had finally
completed their mission.

324
00:18:57,333 --> 00:19:00,041
Now then, concerning the Queen.

325
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:02,208
That stone is a
type of magic item

326
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:05,416
that enhances the power of
the individual who wears it.

327
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,250
But only a member
of the Elf Tribe

328
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,541
is able to use it effectively.

329
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:12,416
This Midnight Sun
is a curious lot.

330
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,833
I wonder if they might be
descended from the Elf Tribe.

331
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:17,833
Listen well, Asta.

332
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:20,458
The two weapons you carry
are all that remain

333
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:22,875
of the pair of magic
swords once wielded

334
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:25,208
by the leader of the Elf Tribe.

335
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:26,333
The elves.

336
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:28,125
The ones from the legends.

337
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,333
So they were actually real?

338
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:32,416
Regardless of which
magic stones are held

339
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,666
by whom, we can't say for
certain what will take place.

340
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:36,916
But still!

341
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,041
Whatever the future may
hold, we Magic Knights

342
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:42,583
will always protect the Clover
Kingdom and its inhabitants!

343
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:45,333
Yuno, Mimosa,
I'm counting on you.

344
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:46,458
Right!

345
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:47,916
There's no need to worry.

346
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,916
I'll stop any foe who dares
to stand in our way.

347
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,500
Because I'm going
to be the Wizard King.

348
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,166
You got that, Asta?

349
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:59,166
You will never get
the best of me!

350
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:08,333
Take a look at that.

351
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:13,458
It's from that old broad who
runs the Forest of Witches.

352
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:15,166
Fighting off the Eye
of the Midnight Sun

353
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,625
and the Diamond army
at the same time!

354
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:19,250
It sounds like the
Black Bulls have done

355
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:21,166
yet another remarkable job.

356
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,166
Thank you, as always.

357
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:26,083
That's nice and all, but I
feel like my team and I

358
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:28,916
deserve a handful of stars
to go with that thank-you.

359
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,791
Come on, man. Don't hold out.

360
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:34,166
[coughs] Now then.

361
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,083
We've had a great deal of news.

362
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:38,416
Some good, some not so good.

363
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,500
The good news is that
we're close to locating

364
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:42,666
the Eye of the
Midnight Sun's hideout.

365
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,791
Yeah?

366
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,916
You're right, that's
really good news.

367
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,208
Now tell me the not-so-good.

368
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:49,750
It would appear as
though they're only

369
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:53,000
just getting started,
I'm afraid.

370
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:59,291
Very soon, we'll have
to fight them again.

371
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:00,916
Let's be ready.

372
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,958
[FULL CAST]
Clover Clips!

[KLAUS, MIMOSA]
"Prayers."

374
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,375
Please restore Asta's arms!

375
00:23:07,458 --> 00:23:09,250
Please restore Asta's arms!

376
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:12,500
...501, 502, 503...

377
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:16,250
Yuno! You try, too!

378
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:17,333
[YUNO]
Nope.

379
00:23:17,416 --> 00:23:19,666
[KLAUS]
Don't be shy! Hurry!

380
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:37,541
[JULIUS]
Hey, This is kind of fun.

381
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:44,000
Can I leave now?

382
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,041
[JULIUS] Time to announce
the achievements

383
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:50,375
for all the Magic Knight
squads at the Star Festival!

384
00:23:50,458 --> 00:23:52,000
Should be interesting!

385
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:55,416
<i>Black Clover</i> , Page 67:
"A Fun Festival Double Date!"

386
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,958
Ooh, a date! I remember
when I was young.

387
00:23:58,041 --> 00:24:00,625
Time for a stroll
down memory lane.
