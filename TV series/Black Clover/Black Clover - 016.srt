00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:15,625
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:18,625
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,625
[NARRATOR] All seemed
lost until a lone mage

4
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:27,291
stepped forward
and took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:35,583
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:40,000
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:44,541
[ASTA] Yuno. You and me,
we're family, right?

8
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:45,833
[YUNO]
Yeah, of course.

9
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:47,958
[ASTA] Not by blood
or anything, though.

10
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:49,458
[YUNO]
Right.

11
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:51,000
But we're closer
than a lot of people

12
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:53,166
who are related
by blood, aren't we?

13
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,416
I guess so. Why, what's up?

14
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,083
[ASTA]
I was thinking.

15
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:59,791
You and me, we don't
have any real relatives,

16
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:02,750
but we've got a lot
of great friends.

17
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:10,541
What I think is we
should take the friends

18
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:12,416
we have now, and the
ones we'll meet later,

19
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,208
and make them our family.

20
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:16,416
Yeah!

21
00:01:25,625 --> 00:01:27,458
We're almost there now.

22
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:29,791
It should be just
through this hallway.

23
00:01:36,541 --> 00:01:39,208
[MIMOSA gasps]
Isn't that simply marvelous?

24
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:41,500
[KLAUS]
Hmph. Some dungeon that was.

25
00:01:41,583 --> 00:01:43,333
Not much to it at all.

26
00:01:43,416 --> 00:01:45,291
So, what's your plan
for getting past this?

27
00:01:45,375 --> 00:01:47,041
It doesn't appear
as if the Black Bulls

28
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:48,666
have managed to find it yet.

29
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,083
Of course they haven't.

30
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:52,208
Despite their bluster,
they never stood a chance

31
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:53,625
of beating us here.

32
00:01:53,708 --> 00:01:55,416
[MIMOSA]
You're probably right.

[KLAUS]
Mimosa!

35
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:05,083
Such a keen mana sense,
but she never saw it coming!

36
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,916
This is no trap magic.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,375
So, what is it?

38
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:14,750
Who goes there?

[MARS]
You're in my way.

40
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:20,708
Now move.

See, what you really need

are friends you know
you can count on.

43

Well, I sorry about this,
but I've got things to do.

this interesting.

Oh, yeah! Let's do this.
Time to fight!

00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:15,208
So much potential.

have to tell you?

[TEACHER 16A]
I can't believe this!

67
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,958
An ordinary citizen
defeated a noble?

68
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:46,958
[TEACHER 16B] It's never
happened in all the time

00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:49,208
our school's held
this tournament.

[BOY 16B]
Oh, man.

I've been giving that
kid a hard time, too.

73

What if he decides
to get me back?

[BOY 16D]
What a freak.

You actually beat a noble
using your magic?

Oh, Luck! That's fantastic!

Who knew you would turn
out to be so powerful?

They're here?

Luck likes fighting.

We could leave it

you can bet they'll be headed
for the treasure hall.

supposed to be our priority.

If we don't hurry,

get the credit.

Huh, I'm guessing
something more than smoke

00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:35,625
[LUCK]
Wait. I can't remember.

161
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,875
What am I looking for, again?

162
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,791
[KLAUS] There's so much
strength behind his attacks,

163
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:54,583
and he's not even
using a grimoire.

164
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:57,791
No sign of his magic
power decreasing, either.

165
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,416
[KLAUS]
If this keeps up...

166
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,833
Right. Yuno!

167
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,833
I'll stay here and hold him off.

168
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:06,166
Go on ahead to
the treasure hall.

169
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,541
He's extremely strong.

170
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,666
Are you sure you can
handle him without backup?

171
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,041
Stop questioning me
and do as I say!

172
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,583
We're out of options.

173
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:17,041
I don't like leaving this task
in the hands of a commoner.

174
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:21,250
But for the good of our kingdom,
we will complete our mission!

175
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:28,208
[KLAUS]
It's about time, you brat.

176
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,375
[gasps]
No!

177
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,916
Here, boy.

178
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,291
I can take all
your worries away.

[gasps]

181
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:48,708
[ASTA]
Yuno.

182
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,291
You and me, we're family, right?

183
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:56,916
[ASTA] We're closer
than a lot of people

184
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
who are related by blood.

185
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:02,541
[LOTUS] Another spirited fellow
come to join us, I see,

186
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:04,833
[YUNO]
I guess so. Why, what's up?

187
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:07,333
What are you doing,
you imbecile?

188
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:08,666
[ASTA]
I was thinking.

189
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,083
Well, hello, there.
And who are you?

190
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:13,083
Who am I?

191
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,750
[ASTA] You and me, we don't
have any real relatives,

192
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:18,583
but we've got a lot
of great friends.

193
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:21,833
The mission needs to be
your priority right now.

194
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:23,458
[ASTA] We should take
the friends we have now,

195
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:26,750
and the ones we'll meet later,
and make them our family.

196
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,375
No, sir.

197
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,791
--[YUNO] You are my friend!
--[ASTA] I am his friend!

198
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:50,000
Right. Yuno!

199
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,000
I'll stay here and hold him off.

200
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:54,291
Go on ahead to
the treasure hall.

201
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:00,958
[KLAUS]
It's about time, you brat.

00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:04,000
[gasps]
No!

203
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:19,750

What were you thinking
coming back here,

207
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:47,458
you imbecile? We have
a mission to complete.

208
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,458
And that means getting
to the treasure hall,

209
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:51,791
even if you must go alone.

210
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:56,416
[YUNO]
First, we defeat him.

211
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,958
Then we go to the hall together.

212
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:05,291
[running footsteps]

213
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:10,458
You're taking us
on now! You ready?

214
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:11,625
Ooh.

215
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:13,541
Your friends are coming
out to play, too?

216
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:15,250
How delightful.

217
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:17,583
[VILLAGER 16A]
From what they say,

218
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:19,416
sounds like she
just up and died.

219
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,416
[VILLAGER 16B] She did seem
to be under a lot of stress.

220
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,041
[VILLAGER 16C]
Left her kid behind, too.

221
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:26,125
Poor thing must be heartbroken.

222
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:27,833
[VILLAGER 16B]
Well, I don't know about that.

223
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:29,666
He's a strange one.

224
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,916
[VILLAGER 16A] His mother's
dead, and he's smiling.

225
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,375
He's mine.

00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:39,250
[NOELLE gasps]
Luck, wait.

227
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,791
[LUCK]
He's my prey.

228
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:43,458
[LUCK'S MOTHER]
Win.

229
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:47,458
[LUCK] I will win, and dedicate
my victory to you, Mom.

I'll take him on
alone. Stay back!

I don't need friends
to help me win.

232
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:58,500
I'll use the power
only I possess.

233
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:00,250
Please, Luck! Let us help!

234
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,583
I have to do it by myself,

235
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:04,250
or I'll never earn
my mom's acceptance.

isn't the time

to hold back, you know.

[LUCK]
I'll do it. I'll win.

I have to. For Mom!

me. Or I'll be all alone.

You go ahead and do
what you gotta do, Luck.

But so will I, got it?

245
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:42,125
I have to beat him on my own.

isn't happening!

that even I have friends

It does sound a lot more
fun to fight together.

Hm.

[LOTUS] Well, this isn't
a good turn of events.

If that's how it's going to be,

to get serious.

There's no escaping now.

we don't lose to anyone,

[NOELLE] This place is
filling up with smoke.

293
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:45,541
We'll wind up suffocating
at this rate.

294
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:49,625
Our only chance is to defeat
the spellcaster, and fast!

295
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:51,750
[LUCK]
I can sense his magic power,

296
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:54,458
so I have a good idea
of where he might be.

297
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:57,083
If we attack, he'll
most likely dodge it.

What do I know about his
fighting style so far?

299

[LUCK]
When he's inside the smoke,

300
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,208
he can move really fast,

301
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:08,250
and he can pick up on
magic power quickly, too.

302
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:13,208
[LUCK] Our best shot is to
find a way to blindside him.

00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:15,375
But how, when he
can sense our magic?

[ASTA yelling]

305
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:23,083
[LOTUS] This spell is effective,
but it uses a very high

306
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:24,958
amount of magic power.

00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:26,708
I may not be young
like you three,

308
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,458
but I can do this all day.

309
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:30,250
[LOTUS] Of course, it would
help if I could actually

310
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,791
see my opponents.

311
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:34,875
Don't get any foolish ideas.
I can sense your magic power,

312
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:37,708
so sneak attacks aren't
going to work on me.

313
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,000
Whoa, there!

314
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:49,166
Wow, rapid-fire!

315
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,250
Getting desperate, are we?

316
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:56,083
I'm afraid you won't be
able to hit me like that.

00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:58,291
It won't clear
the smoke, either.

318
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:01,125
All you're doing now
is wasting your power.

319
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,541
I suppose it all comes
down to experience.

320
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:06,416
I've likely been in more battles
than all of you combined.

321
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,375
[grunts]

322

[LOTUS groans]

325
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,500
[LUCK]
First, I cornered him.

326
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,500
[NOELLE] Then, using
every drop of my magic,

327
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:29,000
and in a fraction of a second,
so he wouldn't notice.

328
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:30,500
Up you go!

329
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:34,916
[LUCK]
And Asta, with no magic power

330
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,583
to give him away, attacked!

331
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:42,166
[NOELLE]
That went really well.

332
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,833
You know, you were
right earlier.

333
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:45,916
Teamwork is vital.

334
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,333
What? How is that possible?

335
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:12,875
[panting]

336
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,541
[MARS]
Begone.

337
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:05,416
[FULL CAST]
Clover Clips!

338
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:09,625
[YUNO]
"Family."

339
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:12,625
So. Yuno.

340
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:14,583
Is it true that when
you make new friends

341
00:23:14,666 --> 00:23:17,291
you treasure them like
you would your own family?

342
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:20,208
What a lovely idea!
That sounds so wonderful.

343
00:23:20,291 --> 00:23:21,583
Yeah.

344
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:22,875
Family...

345
00:23:22,958 --> 00:23:25,541
So, does it look a little
something like this?

346
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:29,375
Hey, Big Brother Klaus!

347
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:30,291
[KLAUS]
Hm?

348
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:32,125
[giggles]
Aw, that tickles!

349
00:23:32,208 --> 00:23:33,625
Little Brother Yuno.

350
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:35,625
I got something special for you.

351
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:37,708
[YUNO]
Ooh, my own glasses!

352
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:40,291
Wow, you're the best.
Thank you, Brother!

353
00:23:41,916 --> 00:23:43,625
Yeah, no way.

354
00:23:46,541 --> 00:23:48,583
[YUNO]
This guy's powerful, all right.

355
00:23:48,666 --> 00:23:51,125
But I can't let myself
be defeated now.

356
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:54,416
Not if I'm going to
become the Wizard King.

357

<i>Black Clover</i> ,
Page 17: "Destroyer."

358
00:23:57,958 --> 00:24:00,416
My magic is never giving up!
