[NARRATOR]
The Clover Kingdom.

00:00:24,222 --> 00:00:26,641
In this place where
magic is everything,

3
00:00:26,725 --> 00:00:29,561
there lives one boy
who was born without it.

4
00:00:29,644 --> 00:00:31,938
His name is Asta.

5
00:00:33,398 --> 00:00:34,816
[NARRATOR]
His strength and determination

6
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:37,193
helped him become
a Magic Knight.

7
00:00:37,277 --> 00:00:39,821
And despite the many
challenges he faces,

8
00:00:39,904 --> 00:00:43,616
he aims for the top
and refuses to give up!

9
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,285
Rich or poor,

10
00:00:45,368 --> 00:00:47,412
royalty or commoner,

11
00:00:47,495 --> 00:00:50,331
Asta believes anyone can shine.

12
00:00:50,415 --> 00:00:53,376
His mission is to prove
that to the whole world

13
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,254
and to become the
next Wizard King!

14
00:00:58,173 --> 00:01:01,051
[NARRATOR] Asta and the others
are training to defeat Megicula,

00:01:01,134 --> 00:01:03,178
a devil who waits
in the Spade Kingdom.

who suffers from
Megicula's curse,

21
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,564
gave them six months to prepare.

22
00:01:14,647 --> 00:01:17,108
In that brief span of time,
these young knights

23
00:01:17,192 --> 00:01:20,653
must surpass their limits
and become unstoppable!

Gah! I'm so exhausted!

Good job in your training, Asta.

27
00:01:33,708 --> 00:01:36,252
[gasps] Hey, Finral!

28
00:01:36,336 --> 00:01:38,755
Is there a problem or something?

29
00:01:38,838 --> 00:01:40,715
Sadly, yes.

30
00:01:42,592 --> 00:01:44,427
It turns out I'm cursed, too!

[yelps]

32
00:01:46,304 --> 00:01:48,390
Being salacious doesn't mean
you're cursed, Finral.

33
00:01:48,473 --> 00:01:50,558
It just means
you're insufferable.

34
00:01:50,642 --> 00:01:51,768
Hello there, Noelle,

35
00:01:51,851 --> 00:01:53,812
you're looking
positively radiant today!

36
00:01:53,895 --> 00:01:56,106
Wait-- No, bad Finral!
You have to stop!

37
00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:57,023
Bad, bad, bad, bad...

38
00:01:57,107 --> 00:01:58,233
Insect.

39
00:01:58,316 --> 00:01:59,359
That's rough.

40
00:01:59,442 --> 00:02:01,861
No, hold on!
Let me explain, okay?

41
00:02:01,945 --> 00:02:04,364
It was something
Langris told me.

42
00:02:04,447 --> 00:02:05,907
It's plain to see
that you're cursed!

43
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,492
[FINRAL]
What?

44
00:02:07,575 --> 00:02:08,785
[LANGRIS] You hit on every girl
you meet like a wannabe playboy!

00:02:08,868 --> 00:02:10,203
[FINRAL]
Playboy?

46
00:02:10,286 --> 00:02:11,287
[LANGRIS] And the time you
spent shirking your duties

47
00:02:11,371 --> 00:02:12,163
made you a bigger
failure than ever!

48
00:02:12,247 --> 00:02:13,707
[FINRAL]
Failure?

49
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:14,958
[LANGRIS] That freewheeling life
has left you with bad habits

50
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:16,459
--that won't just break!
--[FINRAL] Bad Habits?

51
00:02:16,543 --> 00:02:17,961
[LANGRIS] There's no way that
a self-centered degenerate

52
00:02:18,044 --> 00:02:20,714
like you could make
Lady Finnes happy!

53
00:02:20,797 --> 00:02:22,966
[FINRAL]
That stung.

54
00:02:23,049 --> 00:02:26,261
And I have my heart set
on a very special woman,

55
00:02:26,344 --> 00:02:29,347
so I have to be freed
from this curse!

56
00:02:29,431 --> 00:02:30,890
If I don't change my ways,

57
00:02:30,974 --> 00:02:33,518
I'll never be good enough
for Lady Finnes!

58
00:02:33,601 --> 00:02:37,522
[NOELLE] That must be the person
Captain Yami mentioned before.

59
00:02:37,605 --> 00:02:41,985
Wow, I had no idea Finral could
be serious about someone.

60
00:02:42,068 --> 00:02:43,111
[FINRAL]
So, Asta.

61
00:02:43,194 --> 00:02:45,363
I'm gonna need
a training partner!

62
00:02:45,447 --> 00:02:46,990
Help me get past
this terrible curse

63
00:02:47,073 --> 00:02:49,159
and make my heart stronger!

64
00:02:49,242 --> 00:02:52,454
Sounds like you mean it.

65
00:02:52,537 --> 00:02:55,123
Sure! I'll do whatever
I can to help you out!

66
00:02:55,206 --> 00:02:56,416
Let's go kick that curse's butt

67
00:02:56,499 --> 00:02:58,752
so you can make that lady
super happy one day!

68
00:02:58,835 --> 00:03:00,962
Thank you, friend!

69
00:03:01,046 --> 00:03:03,965
[NOELLE] If they're training
to make his heart stronger...

[BLACK BULLS]
Bottom's up!

71
00:03:07,135 --> 00:03:09,804
[NOELLE]
What are they doing at a mixer?

72
00:04:44,649 --> 00:04:47,027
[ASTA] I didn't know goin' to
mixers made your heart stronger,

73
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,029
but hey, this is fun!

00:04:49,112 --> 00:04:51,906
[LUCK] Hope I get to
fight somebody this time!

75
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:54,743
[REBECCA] Why would Asta invite
me to a mixer all of a sudden?

76
00:04:54,826 --> 00:04:56,244
I wonder what he's thinking.

77
00:04:56,327 --> 00:04:58,830
I'm certainly not
gonna complain, though!

78
00:04:58,913 --> 00:05:00,790
[KAREN] Since when is
Rebecca so buddy-buddy

79
00:05:00,874 --> 00:05:02,751
with all these Magic Knights?

80
00:05:02,834 --> 00:05:04,419
Whatever, I just
wanna get married.

81
00:05:04,502 --> 00:05:06,504
I don't even care
who I end up with.

82
00:05:06,588 --> 00:05:08,965
[ELIZA] Mm... I'm not
interested in real guys.

83
00:05:09,049 --> 00:05:11,009
I just didn't wanna
turn down the invite.

84
00:05:11,092 --> 00:05:12,677
Let's get this over with
so I can go home

85
00:05:12,761 --> 00:05:14,721
and finish reading my book.

86
00:05:14,804 --> 00:05:16,139
[FINRAL]
This is the perfect battlefield

87
00:05:16,222 --> 00:05:18,600
to start my training!
It'll be rude not to sweet-talk

88
00:05:18,683 --> 00:05:20,435
these ladies and make
them feel special,

89
00:05:20,518 --> 00:05:22,103
so it's even more
of a challenge!

90
00:05:22,187 --> 00:05:24,522
That curse'll be
gone in no time!

00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,108
[NOELLE]
Training, really?

92
00:05:27,192 --> 00:05:29,778
To think, I almost changed
my mind about that sleazeball.

93
00:05:29,861 --> 00:05:31,654
I'm just here
because I'm worried.

94
00:05:31,738 --> 00:05:34,491
Wait a sec, what exactly
am I worried about?

95

You've got a little
bit right here.

I forgot all about that girl!

Easy! I know this is
your first day and all,

100
00:05:45,585 --> 00:05:48,171
but could you maybe try
not to destroy my bar, miss?

101
00:05:48,254 --> 00:05:50,048
Mind your own
business, beer boy.

102
00:05:50,131 --> 00:05:52,926
[TAVERN OWNER 135A] I'd say this
is my business, wouldn't you?

103
00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:54,177
Fine, but I'm watching you!

104
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,261
If you break anything else,

105
00:05:55,345 --> 00:05:57,430
you're fired, do you
understand me?

a job at this place?

108
00:06:03,728 --> 00:06:04,854
[SECRÉ]
Just because.

109
00:06:04,938 --> 00:06:06,898
This isn't something
you should do for fun.

110
00:06:06,981 --> 00:06:09,150
It's a very serious profession!

[NOELLE]
Oh, no, she's adorable!

113
00:06:14,447 --> 00:06:15,615
If Asta sees her like that,

114
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:18,576
what's to stop him from
falling in, in you know?

115
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,661
What's wrong?

116
00:06:19,744 --> 00:06:21,329
Uh. I'm gonna go
check on Asta's table,

117
00:06:21,413 --> 00:06:22,914
you can take care of
whoever else you want,

118

just leave that one to me.

[NOELLE] Wait, why am I trying
to keep her away from Asta?

120
00:06:27,377 --> 00:06:29,754
It's not like I care
if he has feelings for her

00:06:29,838 --> 00:06:31,548

you staring off into space?

It's your turn to introduce
yourself to the group!

Eh. I'd prefer to eat
quietly without socializing.

Huh?

132
00:06:53,778 --> 00:06:56,114
You see, all I wanted was
a little time to relax alone,

Ugh. Every mixer I go to,

there's always this one jerk
who thinks it's cool to act like

he doesn't wanna be there.

138

He changed his hair,

but this is definitely the
same jerk from last time.

so let's enjoy our
dinner together okay?

Finral, I'd love to hear
about your adventures

143
00:07:16,092 --> 00:07:17,510
as a Magic Knight--

144
00:07:17,594 --> 00:07:20,513
[FINRAL] Nah. That's not really
my thing, I'm gonna pass.

00:07:20,597 --> 00:07:22,557
[REBECCA, KAREN]
What isn't your thing?

146
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,477
[FINRAL] Gah, I'm dying!
She's actually interested

147
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,853
in having a conversation with me

148
00:07:26,936 --> 00:07:29,105
and I'm supposed
to push her away?!

Try to stay strong, Finral!

150
00:07:30,774 --> 00:07:32,817
It's all part of your
training, remember?

151
00:07:32,901 --> 00:07:34,402
Oh, no!

152
00:07:34,486 --> 00:07:37,614
My muscle memory is making me
reach for a bouquet of flowers!

Take it easy there, right hand!

154
00:07:40,158 --> 00:07:42,160
Man, asking me not
to flirt with girls

155
00:07:42,243 --> 00:07:44,621
is like asking a fish
to climb a tree!

156
00:07:44,704 --> 00:07:47,207
[KAREN]
I do not understand this guy.

00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:48,750
[ASTA]
Oh, I get it!

158
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:51,169
Finral's doing everything he can
to fight against his curse!

159
00:07:51,252 --> 00:07:52,712
Oh, he's so tough!

160
00:07:52,796 --> 00:07:55,173
[LUCK] I wonder when
the battle's gonna start.

161
00:07:55,256 --> 00:07:56,966
[NOELLE] Maybe there's
nothing to worry about.

162
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:00,011
[SEKKE] I finally made it
to the bar! Ha, ha!

163
00:08:01,346 --> 00:08:02,681
Sorry it took me so long.

164
00:08:02,764 --> 00:08:04,557
I've been really busy
protecting the kingdom

165
00:08:04,641 --> 00:08:07,227
from certain destruction,
you know how it is!

166
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:09,854
Naturally, I can't share
any of the details,

167
00:08:09,938 --> 00:08:12,357
but the point is that something
truly a- <i>ha</i> -wful happened

168
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,275
and I'm the hero
who saved the day!

169
00:08:14,359 --> 00:08:16,277
Some Magic Knights
lost their ma- <i>ha</i> -rbles,

170
00:08:16,361 --> 00:08:18,613
but I was there
to set them straight!

171
00:08:18,697 --> 00:08:19,906
It's only a matter of time

172
00:08:19,989 --> 00:08:22,784
before they promote me
to captain, ha, ha!

173
00:08:22,867 --> 00:08:26,037
It's true. My life
is suddenly awesome.

174
00:08:26,121 --> 00:08:30,375
And the King! He loves me!
What can ya do?

175
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:31,835
Whoopsie!

176
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:34,170
Did I divulge too much
to- <i>ha</i> -p secret info?

177
00:08:37,007 --> 00:08:38,633
Well, at least I
haven't been reading

178
00:08:38,717 --> 00:08:40,677
dirty magazines
like my pal here.

179
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,887
Though, I'd better
not reveal that either.

180
00:08:42,971 --> 00:08:46,057
Dude! You already told
them, as plain as day!

181
00:08:46,141 --> 00:08:47,517
The ladies like it when a guy

182
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,144
has a touch of
mystery about him.

183
00:08:49,227 --> 00:08:51,146
[NOELLE] Apparently,
this is a popular spot

184
00:08:51,229 --> 00:08:52,856
for weirdos to have mixers.

185
00:08:52,939 --> 00:08:54,566
What's that loud
guy's name again?

186
00:08:54,649 --> 00:08:56,526
I don't mean to brag,
but according to the guys

187
00:08:56,609 --> 00:08:58,069
who went to visit
the Heart Kingdom,

188
00:08:58,153 --> 00:09:00,864
there's some kind of amazing
secret behind my Bronze Magic.

189
00:09:00,947 --> 00:09:02,574
Protecting the world
is a tough job,

190
00:09:02,657 --> 00:09:05,160
but it's something only
yours truly can do!

191
00:09:05,243 --> 00:09:07,495
Not to worry, there's no
need to thank me!

192
00:09:07,579 --> 00:09:09,414
Unless you want to. Ha, ha!

193
00:09:09,497 --> 00:09:12,667
[NOELLE] Oh, right.
This is the "ha-ha guy."

194
00:09:12,751 --> 00:09:13,835
[SEKKE]
Da- <i>ha</i> -rling!

Bring us another round
of drinks, please,

[GROUP yelps]

00:09:18,423 --> 00:09:20,425
As soon as I read that
weird article about you,

199
00:09:20,508 --> 00:09:22,844
I knew there had to be
some kind of mistake.

200
00:09:22,927 --> 00:09:25,722
Asta, a criminal? Come on, now.

201
00:09:25,805 --> 00:09:27,557
Thanks, but it's
not totally wrong.

202
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,352
They are planning to execute me
for treason pretty soon.

203
00:09:30,435 --> 00:09:32,228
You're being
sentenced to death?!

204
00:09:32,312 --> 00:09:33,772
Yeah, but it's not
that big a deal.

205
00:09:33,855 --> 00:09:36,107
It's just a little treason,
and I didn't even do it.

206
00:09:36,191 --> 00:09:39,819
Hey, so, you came here to
become stronger, too, right?

00:09:39,903 --> 00:09:41,738
Y'wanna fight me?

[KAREN]
What's he talking about?

209
00:09:43,239 --> 00:09:45,617
Is he using "fight"
as a code word?

210
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,035
I'm flattered,
but don't you think

211
00:09:47,118 --> 00:09:49,037
it's a little too early
for us to get physical?

212
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,996

Huh?

How am I the only one

who's not having
flirtatious banter?

215
00:09:54,167 --> 00:09:55,168
Wait a second.

216
00:09:55,251 --> 00:09:57,045
Maybe I'm looking
at this all wrong!

217
00:09:57,128 --> 00:09:59,673
If I made it this long
without hitting on anyone,

218
00:09:59,756 --> 00:10:02,884
that means my training
must be a huge success!

[FINRAL]
Then again...

220
00:10:06,471 --> 00:10:08,723
I do feel bad that these girls
wasted their evening.

221
00:10:08,807 --> 00:10:11,601
I'd better apologize
and explain later.

Yeah, that's for sure!

[GORDON] I thought it was
just dinner among friends,

but judging by
Captain Charlotte's attire

this is a mixer, isn't it?

but this is worse than
I could've imagined!

call an emergency meeting!

Where did you two come from?

300
00:13:50,945 --> 00:13:53,156
[PULI] The Captain of the
Black Bulls seems to prefer

00:14:06,461 --> 00:14:09,297
Get him some food to show him
how considerate you are!

309
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:11,508
When a plate comes to the table,

310
00:14:11,591 --> 00:14:13,802
grab it and serve it
to him immediately!

311
00:14:13,885 --> 00:14:17,013
That way it'll be obvious
that you're thinking of him!

312
00:14:17,097 --> 00:14:18,723
Because there's nothing
sexier than a partner

313
00:14:18,807 --> 00:14:20,767
who anticipates
your needs, right?

314
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,394
I... suppose so.

315
00:14:22,477 --> 00:14:23,228
Next step!

316
00:14:23,311 --> 00:14:25,355
Try to be a good listener!

317
00:14:25,438 --> 00:14:27,607
Everyone wants to be able
to talk about themselves

318
00:14:27,691 --> 00:14:28,692
as much as possible.

319
00:14:28,775 --> 00:14:30,527
Let him ramble
to his heart's content,

320
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:33,238
and he'll love you for sure!

321
00:14:33,321 --> 00:14:35,323
Your responses can
be anything, really.

322
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:40,620
"Wow!" "That's crazy!" "I had
no idea!" "You're amazing!"

323
00:14:40,704 --> 00:14:42,247
Is that what people want?

324
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:43,623
I didn't realize.

325
00:14:43,707 --> 00:14:45,959
And now, here comes
the final secret!

326
00:14:46,042 --> 00:14:48,628
And this one is
absolutely pivotal!

327
00:14:48,712 --> 00:14:51,047
What? Tell me everything!

328
00:14:51,131 --> 00:14:53,883
Something called
the casual touch!

329
00:14:53,967 --> 00:14:57,053
[CHARLOTTE]
Casual touch?

330
00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:00,432
I'm sorry, there's simply no way

331
00:15:00,515 --> 00:15:01,975
I could do something
so daring as to make...

332
00:15:02,058 --> 00:15:03,768
[PULI] Hate to break it to you,
but being considerate

333
00:15:03,852 --> 00:15:05,937
and listening only account
for about ten percent

334
00:15:06,021 --> 00:15:07,105
of attracting a man.

335
00:15:07,188 --> 00:15:09,357
The other 90 is
all about the touching!

336
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:11,818
Well, that doesn't seem fair!

337
00:15:11,901 --> 00:15:13,111
[CHARLOTTE]
It's no use.

338
00:15:13,194 --> 00:15:15,071
I don't have what it takes!

339
00:15:15,155 --> 00:15:16,698
We believe in you, ma'am!

340
00:15:16,781 --> 00:15:18,908
You can't just let
your rival defeat you!

341
00:15:18,992 --> 00:15:20,243
[gasps]

342
00:15:23,121 --> 00:15:25,790
But, I...

343
00:15:25,874 --> 00:15:29,377
[PULI] We'll be behind you
every step of the way, Captain!

344
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:31,880
Thank you. All of you.

345
00:15:31,963 --> 00:15:34,799
I understand what
needs to be done.

346
00:15:34,883 --> 00:15:38,636
At some point,
I'm going to touch Yami!

347
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,847
Finral, I love how
cool and aloof you are.

348
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:42,474
You're just like the
Magic Knight Fiorel

349
00:15:42,557 --> 00:15:43,850
from the novel I'm reading!

350
00:15:43,933 --> 00:15:46,269
Fiorel is the ultimate hero
because he can harness

351
00:15:46,353 --> 00:15:48,480
the powers of Light, Dark,
Flame, Wind, Water...

352
00:15:48,563 --> 00:15:50,940
[FINRAL] All of those?
That's just bad writing!

353
00:15:51,024 --> 00:15:54,444
So, Luck, it sounds like you're
a really talented fighter.

354
00:15:54,527 --> 00:15:56,071
You want me to show you?

355
00:15:56,154 --> 00:15:57,238
[KAREN]
Oh, wow!

356
00:15:57,322 --> 00:15:59,157
I didn't expect him
to be that forward!

357
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,784
From what I've heard
about the Heart Kingdom,

358
00:16:00,867 --> 00:16:03,703
it must be a beautiful place.
I'd love to see it someday.

359
00:16:03,787 --> 00:16:05,497
I'd be happy to take
you there for a visit

360
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:08,500
once this whole thing is over!
We can take your siblings, too!

361
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,085
She's got nerve!

362
00:16:10,168 --> 00:16:12,587
If I let my guard down around
her, she'll scoop him right up!

363
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:15,465
[TAVERN OWNER 135A]
Why did I hire this girl again?

364
00:16:15,548 --> 00:16:16,508
Huh?

365
00:16:16,591 --> 00:16:17,967
[REBECCA]
Noelle?

366
00:16:18,051 --> 00:16:19,761
Um, listen.

367
00:16:19,844 --> 00:16:21,554
So far, I don't really
have any friends

368
00:16:21,638 --> 00:16:23,223
outside of the Black Bulls.

369
00:16:23,306 --> 00:16:25,350
So I would love to get
acquainted with you.

370
00:16:25,433 --> 00:16:26,851
Oh, and I should
probably mention,

371
00:16:26,935 --> 00:16:28,978
my hobby is making dolls,
so I hope it wouldn't bother you

372
00:16:29,062 --> 00:16:31,272
if I crafted one in
your likeness, Miss Puli.

373
00:16:31,356 --> 00:16:33,149
Aw! I'd be honored if you did.

374
00:16:33,233 --> 00:16:34,484
I'll even give you
my measurements

375
00:16:34,567 --> 00:16:36,486
so it'll be an
accurate depiction!

376
00:16:36,569 --> 00:16:37,987
[GORDON]
Uh, great!

377
00:16:38,071 --> 00:16:39,864
[MAGNA] There's no way I'll lose
after the expert coaching

378
00:16:39,948 --> 00:16:42,200
I've had from Charmy!

379
00:16:42,283 --> 00:16:43,451
[CHARLOTTE]
I can't exactly reach out

380
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:45,620
and touch Yami out of nowhere.

381
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:48,748
I'd better start
with serving him food.

382
00:16:48,832 --> 00:16:49,582
[gasps]

383
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:51,668
[YAMI]
Here. Have some.

384
00:16:51,751 --> 00:16:53,795
[CHARLOTTE]
Oh, thank you.

385
00:16:53,878 --> 00:16:55,630
[CHARLOTTE]
He beat me to the punch!

386
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:57,966
What am I supposed to do now?

387
00:16:58,049 --> 00:17:00,385
[YAMI] You sure were taking
a dump for a long time.

388
00:17:00,468 --> 00:17:03,221
Oh, sorry, I mean,
"powdering your nose."

389
00:17:03,304 --> 00:17:04,639
How crude!

390
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:06,683
I needed to have a conversation
with my subordinates,

391
00:17:06,766 --> 00:17:08,518
not that it's any
of your business!

392
00:17:08,601 --> 00:17:10,895
Uh-huh. Guess that's
why I keep seeing

393
00:17:10,979 --> 00:17:13,398
your Blue Rose girls
sneaking back and forth.

394
00:17:13,481 --> 00:17:14,774
You noticed, then?

395
00:17:14,858 --> 00:17:17,652
Well, I suppose they
were hard to miss.

396
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:20,030
[YAMI] They're probably
worried about you.

397
00:17:20,113 --> 00:17:22,323
We all know you can't
hold your liquor.

398
00:17:22,407 --> 00:17:23,533
[CHARLOTTE]
That's not--!

399
00:17:23,616 --> 00:17:26,786
I mean, I certainly
can't dispute that fact.

400
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:28,329
Whether we're on
a mission or not,

401
00:17:28,413 --> 00:17:31,791
the Blue Rose Knights always
have my best interests at heart.

402
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:33,043
They were the ones who arranged

403
00:17:33,126 --> 00:17:35,545
this dinner party
tonight, just for me!

404
00:17:35,628 --> 00:17:38,423
I tend to get so focused
on fighting and being strong

405
00:17:38,506 --> 00:17:40,884
that I forget about
everything else.

406
00:17:40,967 --> 00:17:43,261
So I end up relying on them.

407
00:17:43,345 --> 00:17:44,763
[CHARLOTTE]
Oh, no!

408
00:17:44,846 --> 00:17:48,266
I'm running my mouth when
I should be listening to him!

409
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,851
[YAMI]
That's all right.

410
00:17:49,934 --> 00:17:52,854
You gotta learn how to
lean on other people more.

411
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:57,901
Heh. I depend on my squad.

412
00:17:57,984 --> 00:18:00,779
For dumps. Oh, I'm sorry,
for powdering my nose,

413
00:18:00,862 --> 00:18:03,448
I have one of 'em make a portal
for me so it's easier--

414
00:18:03,531 --> 00:18:06,117
[CHARLOTTE] Shouldn't you
do that for yourself?

415
00:18:06,201 --> 00:18:07,786
[YAMI] You know,
that meat's pretty good.

416
00:18:07,869 --> 00:18:10,080
You oughta try it
with some pepper.

417
00:18:10,163 --> 00:18:11,498
[CHARLOTTE]
All right.

418
00:18:18,588 --> 00:18:20,465
[PULI]
Ah?

419
00:18:20,548 --> 00:18:23,134
[CHARLOTTE]
I feel Yami's hand on mine.

420
00:18:23,218 --> 00:18:25,637
Is this a casual touch?

[SOL]

00:18:35,772 --> 00:18:37,190
For crying out loud,
you don't have to act like

00:18:37,273 --> 00:18:39,651
you just got infected with
the damn plague or somethin'.

426
00:18:39,734 --> 00:18:40,944
I keep my hands clean!

427
00:18:41,027 --> 00:18:43,905
I'm pretty sure that's
not the problem.

428
00:18:43,988 --> 00:18:46,950
[ELIZA] I want you to understand
how great Fiorel is!

429
00:18:47,033 --> 00:18:48,576
I think we should have
a reading party tonight,

430
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,745
just you and me
all alone in my room!

431
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:52,330
Nah, I'm good.

432
00:18:52,414 --> 00:18:54,874
I appreciate the offer, but that
sort of thing isn't my scene.

433

It's not fair!

actually looks my way

at a mixer, and here I am
trying to be decent!

Don't you dare
touch her, Finral!

00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:05,093
I know you!

438
00:19:05,176 --> 00:19:06,720
As soon as you make
physical contact,

439
00:19:06,803 --> 00:19:09,055
you're gonna go right back
into ladies-man mode!

do you think I am, mister?

Come on, you can do it!

ulterior motive for my actions!

00:20:04,861 --> 00:20:05,820
[FINNES]
Finral!

464
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:07,614
[LANGRIS]
You're kidding.

465
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,785
Wow, I didn't know we were
having that kinda party.

466
00:20:11,868 --> 00:20:16,039
[gasps] Get your
hands off me, now!

467
00:20:17,248 --> 00:20:18,625
I was fooling myself.

468
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:22,379
My ideal man only exists
in storybooks, not real life.

469
00:20:22,462 --> 00:20:25,590
Your aggressive behavior tonight
made me realize something.

470
00:20:25,674 --> 00:20:27,300
If I'm too focused
on getting married,

471
00:20:27,384 --> 00:20:29,928
I'll probably end up with a
brute like you and hate my life.

472
00:20:30,011 --> 00:20:30,970
Goodbye!

473
00:20:31,054 --> 00:20:32,347
[laughs]

474
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,140
I brought us here in
disguises so we could keep

475
00:20:34,224 --> 00:20:36,267
an eye on my brother, since
he'd mentioned something about

476
00:20:36,351 --> 00:20:38,228
training to get over his curse.

477
00:20:38,311 --> 00:20:40,563
But, I guess he was just
being his normal stupid self

478
00:20:40,647 --> 00:20:42,107
and there was nothing to see.

479
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,316
I'm sorry.

480
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,276
[FINNES] No. Actually,
I'm really thankful

481
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,238
I was able to be here
for this, Langris.

482
00:20:48,321 --> 00:20:51,408
It's true, Finral does have
a strong interest in women,

483
00:20:51,491 --> 00:20:53,201
but he's also very
kind, and I think

484
00:20:53,284 --> 00:20:56,121
that's one of the
ways he expresses it.

485
00:20:56,204 --> 00:20:59,791
[LANGRIS] You can call him kind.
I call him a girl-crazy loser.

486
00:20:59,874 --> 00:21:03,628
[FINNES chuckles]
Anyway, we should head home.

487
00:21:03,712 --> 00:21:05,630
I didn't know you
guys had jobs here!

488
00:21:05,714 --> 00:21:07,382
Yeah, what are the odds, right?

489
00:21:07,465 --> 00:21:08,717
Small world.

490
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,011
Yep, it's a total coincidence.

491
00:21:11,094 --> 00:21:13,847
You should try being a bit
more forward with Asta.

492
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:15,724
We both know he
isn't too bright.

493
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:17,267
What? I don't know what
you're talking about.

494
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:20,061
I don't have anything to say
to his dumb face, no way!

495
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:21,646
[REBECCA giggles]

496
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:23,314
I'm sorry, Asta.

497
00:21:23,398 --> 00:21:25,608
I dragged you out here
to help me train,

498
00:21:25,692 --> 00:21:28,028
and then I kept
screwing things up.

499
00:21:28,111 --> 00:21:29,279
Just forget it.

500
00:21:29,362 --> 00:21:30,905
I'll never be good enough.

501
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:33,199
Come on, you can't throw
in the towel yet, Finral!

502
00:21:33,283 --> 00:21:35,952
This is only the
beginning, okay?

503
00:21:36,036 --> 00:21:37,787
Thanks, Asta.

504
00:21:37,871 --> 00:21:39,247
Well, I can't say
I've ever seen you

505
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:41,791
in a situation like that before.

506
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:43,877
So, is that the
kinda guy you like?

507
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,004
The dashing young hero?

508
00:21:46,087 --> 00:21:47,088
Don't be ridiculous,

509
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:49,424
that fool could never
obtain my love.

510
00:21:49,507 --> 00:21:50,842
My heart is spoken for.

511
00:21:50,925 --> 00:21:52,552
By someone important to me.

512
00:21:52,635 --> 00:21:54,262
Oh, you don't have
to tell me that.

513
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:55,513
[gasps]

514
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,060
Your heart belongs
to your squad,

515
00:22:00,143 --> 00:22:02,520
you've said it a million times.

516
00:22:02,604 --> 00:22:05,482
[YAMI]
Hm? Are you okay there?

517
00:22:06,649 --> 00:22:08,068
[PULI] Looks like you
still need some help

518
00:22:08,151 --> 00:22:10,111
from your angel of love!

519
00:22:10,195 --> 00:22:14,532
[CHARLOTTE gasps]

520
00:22:14,616 --> 00:22:15,867
[CHARLOTTE]
He's so close!

521
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:17,160
Well, let's do our best

522
00:22:17,243 --> 00:22:21,081
to get along for
six months, all right?

523
00:22:21,164 --> 00:22:22,457
Yes.

524
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,095
[REBECCA] With all the brave
things Asta's been doing lately,

525
00:23:59,179 --> 00:24:01,639
it's no wonder I've got
more rivals than before,

526
00:24:01,723 --> 00:24:03,475
but I refuse to give up yet!

527
00:24:03,558 --> 00:24:07,812
<i>Black Clover</i> , Page 136:
"A Black Deep-Sea Story."

528
00:24:07,896 --> 00:24:10,899
Kahono? Don't tell me
she likes him, too!
