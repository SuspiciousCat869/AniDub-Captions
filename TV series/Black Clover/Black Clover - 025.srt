if you had gone down
a different path.

way I can stop him.

I just have to figure
out what it is.

So now there's five of them?

329
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:42,125
[ASTA]
This curse I've got on me.

330
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:45,916
None of these scrapes and
scratches will stop bleeding!

331
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,750
I'm gonna be in serious trouble
if I lose any more blood.

332
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,250
Ugh.

333
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,333
I don't remember putting out
the call for any extra help.

334
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:54,333
[SALLY]
Really?

335
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:55,375
You might want to
try thanking us.

336
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:56,500
What?!

337
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:57,833
You know what would've
happened to you

338
00:19:57,916 --> 00:20:00,208
if we hadn't shown up
to bail you out?

339
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:01,958
You would have been captured,
cut open, gutted,

340
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,041
and skinned alive.

341
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,583
And if you are
gonna get dissected,

342
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:07,208
I wanna be the one to do it!

343
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:09,750
[RADES]
Will you shut up?

344
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,458
Well now, it looks
like the tables

345
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:13,458
have finally turned,
you little brats.

346
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:15,041
[ASTA]
Heh.

347
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:15,750
[RADES]
Huh?

348
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:17,625
[laughs]

349
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:21,541
[ASTA grunts]

350
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:22,875
Huh?

351
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:26,666
Asta!

352
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,333
What was that?

353
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:30,083
Small surgery.

354
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:33,250
Now I'm ready to fight again!

355
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:36,958
Watch. I'll prove it to you.

356
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:38,375
[RADES]
Seriously?

357
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:40,625
Did he just strike himself
with his own blades

358
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:42,375
to dispel the curse?

359
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:45,750
Unbelievable! Who would do that?

360
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,958
[SALLY giggles]
This kid's funny!

361
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:49,875
Can I pretty please
dissect him later?

362
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,083
Be quiet and focus.

363
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:54,583
Phooey. You're no fun.

364
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:59,500
[ASTA]
Here's the thing.

365
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:03,083
I've been fighting an uphill
battle since I was born.

366
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:05,833
No matter how many
guys you've got,

367
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:09,041
and no matter what you do to me,

368
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:12,166
I'll cut right through
every last one of you!

369
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:16,833
You hear me? Let's see
what you've got!

370
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:49,666
[FULL CAST]
Clover Clips!

371
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:55,125
[VALTOS]
"They'll Never Find Me."

372
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:56,791
He's just toying with you!

373
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,833
He wasn't the one who cast
the Spatial Magic spell.

374
00:22:59,916 --> 00:23:01,875
But the pinpoint accuracy of it.

375
00:23:01,958 --> 00:23:02,958
No one could pull that off

376
00:23:03,041 --> 00:23:05,333
unless they were close
to their target.

377
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,083
They're hiding nearby.

378
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:21,000
[VALTOS chuckles]
They're never gonna find me.

379
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:22,500
He's not in here!

380
00:23:22,583 --> 00:23:23,125
Not here!

381
00:23:23,208 --> 00:23:24,750
You're dead.

382
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:25,916
Not here, either!

383
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,708
[VALTOS]
Any second now.

384
00:23:27,791 --> 00:23:31,875
I'll make my grand entrance
and blow their simple minds.

385
00:23:31,958 --> 00:23:34,875
Well, we know he's not here,
so let's check over that way.

386
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:35,750
Good thinkin'!

387
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:37,125
I'll bet you a month's wages

388
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:38,500
that I'll find him
before you two.

389
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:42,833
[VALTOS] Wait, what?
Should I just lie here?

390
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:48,083
[HEAD CHEF 23A]
Hey, Magic Knights.

391
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:50,916
Fill up on my cooking!
And then do your fighting!

392
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I'll fight on my own
battlefield, the kitchen!

393
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:57,541
<i>Black Clover</i> , Page 26:
"Wounded Beasts."

394
00:23:57,625 --> 00:24:00,833
My magic is cooking
incredible food!
