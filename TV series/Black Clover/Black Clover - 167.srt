1
00:00:22,554 --> 00:00:25,807
[NARRATOR] Within the clover's
fifth leaf, there lives a devil.

2
00:00:27,225 --> 00:00:29,686
[NARRATOR] Asta, born
unable to harness mana,

3
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:31,438
was granted the
power of Anti-magic

4
00:00:31,521 --> 00:00:33,273
from his five-leaf grimoire,

5
00:00:33,356 --> 00:00:37,027
giving him the ability
to nullify spells.

6
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,738
Unfortunately, the members
of Spade Kingdom's

7
00:00:39,821 --> 00:00:42,407
Dark Triad also possess
powers from the devils

8
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:44,284
of the underworld and used them

9
00:00:44,367 --> 00:00:47,620
to launch an invasion on
the neighboring countries.

10
00:00:47,704 --> 00:00:49,664
Gaining strength from
his belief in himself

11
00:00:49,748 --> 00:00:51,791
and from the support
of his friends,

12
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:55,128
Asta continues to fight
for the safety of this world.

13
00:01:03,511 --> 00:01:05,347
Ooh, I just had a great idea!

14
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:09,017
Hey, Megicula, let's not
kill her after all.

15
00:01:10,018 --> 00:01:13,229
[MEGICULA]
Oh? And why is that?

16
00:01:13,313 --> 00:01:15,398
She's the wisdom
of the Heart Kingdom.

17
00:01:15,482 --> 00:01:18,318
I thought it best
to eliminate her.

18
00:01:18,401 --> 00:01:21,237
[VANICA] Eh, who cares
about that stuff?

19
00:01:21,321 --> 00:01:24,115
We should take her back
to Spade with us.

20
00:01:24,199 --> 00:01:25,533
[gasps]

21
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:28,953
By the way, Noelle.

22
00:01:29,037 --> 00:01:33,583
I just remembered, I did fight
some lady with armor like yours.

23
00:01:33,667 --> 00:01:35,669
What was her name?

24
00:01:35,752 --> 00:01:38,046
Oh, yes: Acier!

25
00:01:38,129 --> 00:01:39,756
She was so much fun!

26
00:01:42,092 --> 00:01:43,885
[VANICA]
And, as I recall,

27
00:01:43,968 --> 00:01:46,054
her powers got super
strong when she saw

28
00:01:46,137 --> 00:01:48,598
that I took some poor
little kid hostage.

29
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:53,353
[VANICA] So, if I kidnap
Loropechika here,

30
00:01:53,436 --> 00:01:58,483
then I can only assume you
would get a lot stronger, too!

31
00:01:58,566 --> 00:02:00,652
I can't pretend that
I understand this feeling,

32
00:02:00,735 --> 00:02:04,781
but you're desperate to protect
her because she's your friend.

33
00:02:04,864 --> 00:02:07,534
Right?

34
00:02:07,617 --> 00:02:09,661
None of our people
are going to mind,

35
00:02:09,744 --> 00:02:11,996
so I say we go for it.

36
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,583
[MEGICULA] You know, Vanica,
you're so full of surprises.

37
00:02:15,667 --> 00:02:16,876
It's great.

38
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,420
[VANICA]
Well, now that's decided,

39
00:02:18,503 --> 00:02:19,963
I guess we're done here.

40
00:02:24,217 --> 00:02:26,636
Loropechika! And Noelle!

41
00:02:27,846 --> 00:02:29,597
What is it, my lady?

42
00:02:29,681 --> 00:02:33,184
We're leaving for the
Spade Kingdom already?

43
00:02:33,268 --> 00:02:36,271
Do you think we could
wait a minute or two?

44
00:02:36,354 --> 00:02:37,981
I've almost got
this little beauty

45
00:02:38,064 --> 00:02:39,774
--right where I want her and--
--[VANICA] Don't talk to me.

46
00:02:39,858 --> 00:02:41,901
You're disgusting.

47
00:02:41,985 --> 00:02:45,655
As a matter of fact,
I have no use for you anymore.

48
00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:46,531
[ROBERO]
Huh?

49
00:02:46,614 --> 00:02:51,202

His mana's expanding!

53
00:03:01,838 --> 00:03:07,927
Wait. Lady Vanica.
What are... you...?

54
00:03:08,011 --> 00:03:10,013
This is what's
called a curse bomb!

55
00:03:10,096 --> 00:03:12,682
That devil's power I
gave you Dark Disciples?

56
00:03:12,766 --> 00:03:15,810
Well, it's just about to go...

57
00:03:15,894 --> 00:03:18,021
Boom, bang, crash, pow!

58
00:03:18,104 --> 00:03:19,564
[yelps]

59
00:03:22,525 --> 00:03:26,946
No! What's happening to me?

60
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:30,200
You wouldn't! Would you?

61
00:03:30,283 --> 00:03:33,203
Please don't,
Lady Vanica! I beg you!

62
00:03:33,286 --> 00:03:36,331
[gasping, screaming]

63
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,461
[VANICA] This whole area's
gonna blow sky-high!

64
00:03:41,544 --> 00:03:44,714
But I'm sure you can survive
that, right, tough girl?

65
00:03:44,798 --> 00:03:45,924
And when you do,

66
00:03:46,007 --> 00:03:48,677
I'll be waiting
for you in Spade!

67
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,887
Get strong for me!

68
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:56,101
Fare thee well,
my little Noelle!

69
00:03:56,184 --> 00:03:58,311

[ASTA]
Whoa!

77
00:06:54,154 --> 00:06:57,532
[YAMI] The kid's Anti-magic
is the key to winning this.

78
00:06:57,615 --> 00:07:01,077
Somehow, we gotta land a hit
on that guy with Asta's sword.

79
00:07:03,663 --> 00:07:05,874
[ASTA]
Crap! I'm holding him back,

80
00:07:05,957 --> 00:07:07,417
I know I am!

81
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,837
Captain Yami is the only
reason I'm not dead yet!

82
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,464
Even with six
months of training,

83
00:07:12,547 --> 00:07:15,467
I'm still no match for this guy!

84
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:20,221
Don't give up now!
Keep the attacks coming!

85
00:07:20,305 --> 00:07:21,806
I'm ecstatic.

86
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:26,770
You have no idea what an
immense pleasure this is for me!

87
00:07:26,853 --> 00:07:30,190
[ASTA] I may not understand
these powers I have inside,

88
00:07:30,273 --> 00:07:33,401
but our only hope is for me
to use them at full blast!

89
00:07:33,485 --> 00:07:37,906
Hey, you've been watching,
right, devil?

90
00:07:41,201 --> 00:07:43,453
Good to see ya.

91
00:07:43,536 --> 00:07:45,038
[screams]

92
00:07:45,121 --> 00:07:46,664
What the heck are you?

93
00:07:46,748 --> 00:07:50,043
[laughs] I can't believe
you'd say that to me.

94
00:07:50,126 --> 00:07:53,463
I've been your closest
companion for a while now.

95
00:07:55,882 --> 00:07:57,634
Right, I remember.

96
00:07:59,094 --> 00:08:01,346
[ASTA]
We've met like this before,

97
00:08:01,429 --> 00:08:03,807
but you seem
different this time.

98
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:06,685
[DEVIL]
I'll kill them. Kill them all!

99
00:08:06,768 --> 00:08:08,228
They must pay!

100
00:08:08,311 --> 00:08:10,438
Kill. Kill!

101
00:08:10,522 --> 00:08:14,567
Earlier, I could feel
your rage welling up.

102
00:08:14,651 --> 00:08:16,486
I don't know your reasons,

103
00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:19,489
but you wanna beat
this guy, too, don't you?

104
00:08:19,572 --> 00:08:21,199
I should've had a real
heart-to-heart with you

105
00:08:21,282 --> 00:08:25,328
a long time ago, so I could
understand you better.

106
00:08:25,412 --> 00:08:27,956
No time like the present.

107
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:32,210
Come on, lend me
your powers! Hurry!

108
00:08:33,962 --> 00:08:37,215
[laughs] Okay, sure.

109
00:08:37,298 --> 00:08:39,676
I guess I can let you
take my true strength

110
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:41,344
for a little spin!

111
00:08:41,428 --> 00:08:44,597
Sadly, it won't work with
things the way they are.

112
00:08:44,681 --> 00:08:48,226
I'll need you to give me
something equal in return.

113
00:08:48,309 --> 00:08:49,978
In return?

114
00:08:51,855 --> 00:08:55,567
You're gonna let me take
a part of your body!

115
00:08:55,650 --> 00:09:00,697
[laughs] Remember, you're
making a deal with a devil.

116
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,866
You sure you don't mind?

117
00:09:04,743 --> 00:09:07,203
No matter what it takes.

118
00:09:07,287 --> 00:09:09,873
Even if it means
becoming a devil.

119
00:09:09,956 --> 00:09:12,459
I have to push past my limits!

120
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:16,963
I'm gonna need
backup over here.

121
00:09:17,047 --> 00:09:18,256
Asta!

122
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,511
[ASTA] When Captain Yami
said those words,

123
00:09:23,595 --> 00:09:27,057
it meant everything
in the world to me!

124
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,726
If I can't get through this,

125
00:09:29,809 --> 00:09:32,228
then I'll never become
the Wizard King!

126
00:09:32,312 --> 00:09:34,314
You know, kid, I like you.

127
00:09:34,397 --> 00:09:36,107
Come join our crew.

128
00:09:36,191 --> 00:09:37,776
And then, once we're done,

129
00:09:37,859 --> 00:09:41,029
you go and become
the Wizard King.

130
00:09:41,112 --> 00:09:43,406
I will, Captain Yami.

131
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:46,159
But before I do that,

132
00:09:46,242 --> 00:09:48,828
I want to prove
I've become the person

133
00:09:48,912 --> 00:09:51,664
you always hoped I would be!

134
00:09:51,748 --> 00:09:55,585
All right, it's a deal.
Knock yourself out.

[DEVIL]
Hey, kid.

142
00:10:43,091 --> 00:10:45,927
You should know, that right arm
isn't the same as it was

143
00:10:46,011 --> 00:10:49,389
back when I was just giving you
a little power at a time.

144
00:10:49,472 --> 00:10:52,058
Now it's become power!

145
00:10:52,142 --> 00:10:56,521
You've got 50 seconds
till your body gives out!

146
00:10:56,604 --> 00:10:59,357

That's plenty!

148
00:11:29,596 --> 00:11:32,432
Such marvelous work!

[DANTE yells]

150
00:11:38,938 --> 00:11:40,940
[YAMI] I can tell from
the way he's fighting;

151
00:11:41,024 --> 00:11:45,362
he's on guard when Asta attacks.

152
00:11:45,445 --> 00:11:48,448
That must be Anti-magic
coming from his right arm.

153
00:11:48,531 --> 00:11:51,910
If he can get at least
one decent hit in there,

154
00:11:51,993 --> 00:11:54,037
we can win this!

155
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,165
Show him what
you're made of, Asta!

156
00:11:57,248 --> 00:11:59,125
[YAMI]
He's crushing it!

157
00:12:01,211 --> 00:12:03,338
[YAMI]
Better step up my game!

158
00:12:04,631 --> 00:12:06,508
Let's show him together!

00:13:11,865 --> 00:13:13,491

But don't stop.

Asta.

[FINRAL]
Yami!

175
00:13:23,251 --> 00:13:27,964
I know you're not done yet.
Keep the entertainment coming!

176
00:13:29,049 --> 00:13:30,675
[FINRAL]
Look at them.

177
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:33,219
They're moving insanely fast.

178
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,056
[FINRAL]
But they're totally in sync.

[FINRAL]
Despite everything,

182
00:14:00,789 --> 00:14:03,249
they actually look like
they're having fun.

183
00:14:05,085 --> 00:14:06,711
[DANTE]
Fight me.

184
00:14:12,092 --> 00:14:14,386
[DANTE]
Fight with all you've got.

185
00:14:14,469 --> 00:14:20,141
It won't matter because, in the
end, I will crush everything.

186
00:14:20,225 --> 00:14:21,768
You've already lost!

Ah! You're mine!

I am immortal!

00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,732
[DANTE]
This is the end!

194
00:15:48,938 --> 00:15:51,107
The end for you.

Looks like we haven't
lost after all.

[grunts]

201
00:16:53,044 --> 00:16:57,340
Well done, Asta,
you crazy son of a bitch.

202
00:16:57,424 --> 00:16:58,717
Thanks.

203
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,846
That was incredible!
You totally took him down!

204
00:17:02,929 --> 00:17:07,726
I mean, wow.
That battle--it was amazing!

205
00:17:07,809 --> 00:17:08,977
Yeah, guess so.

206
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,937
Damn straight it was.

207
00:17:15,817 --> 00:17:19,946
Did... you... beat him?

208
00:17:21,114 --> 00:17:22,407
[GAUCHE sighs]

209
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:27,203
What happened?

210
00:17:27,287 --> 00:17:28,955
[GREY]
Gauche.

211
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:33,793
You didn't die! Thank goodness.

212
00:17:33,877 --> 00:17:36,504
You're really okay!

213
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:37,881
Are you okay?

214
00:17:37,964 --> 00:17:39,257
[GREY]
Huh?

215
00:17:39,341 --> 00:17:40,467
[GREY yelps]

216
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:43,386
Um. I'm so sorry!

217
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:45,388
What are you
apologizing for?

218
00:17:45,472 --> 00:17:49,893
Yeah, something is up
with those two, for sure.

219
00:17:49,976 --> 00:17:51,227
Going somewhere?

220
00:17:51,311 --> 00:17:53,563
What's up?

221
00:17:53,646 --> 00:17:58,943
[sighs] He may be out of
commission now, even dying,

222
00:17:59,027 --> 00:18:00,904
but we should tie
him up to be safe.

223
00:18:00,987 --> 00:18:02,530
[FINRAL]
Oh, good point!

224
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:05,825
I'm glad we're finally finished
with this psycho stalker.

225
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:09,788
I've better ways
to spend my time.

226
00:18:09,871 --> 00:18:14,668
Though, we did capture the
enemy's top devil-possessed.

227
00:18:14,751 --> 00:18:16,753
So I guess it's happily ev--

228

[YAMI gasps]

229
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:22,217
[FINRAL]
Man, I am officially beat.

230
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,552
--I can't wait to...
--[thudding]

231
00:18:41,778 --> 00:18:47,117
[FINRAL]
No. Yami!

232
00:18:48,368 --> 00:18:52,372
[YAMI] I screwed up.
He's got me pinned.

233
00:18:52,455 --> 00:18:54,207
[FINRAL]
Who is that?

234
00:18:56,543 --> 00:18:58,044
[FINRAL]
And there.

235
00:18:58,128 --> 00:19:01,297
It's the captain
of the Golden Dawn!

236
00:19:01,381 --> 00:19:05,218
[DANTE] The key to the
underworld isn't you, per se.

237
00:19:05,301 --> 00:19:09,305
It's a magical channel known
as the Tree of Qliphoth.

238
00:19:09,389 --> 00:19:12,726
To bring that channel into
being, we need Dark Magic

239
00:19:12,809 --> 00:19:16,563
and World Tree Magic,
both at the arcane stage.

240
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:21,860
So this was the source
of the magic fluctuation

241
00:19:21,943 --> 00:19:23,361
I was sensing.

242
00:19:23,445 --> 00:19:25,864
There's no salvation for them.

243
00:19:25,947 --> 00:19:29,743
We hold existence itself
in the palms of our hands.

244
00:19:29,826 --> 00:19:32,245
You gave a speech
like that, then lost.

245
00:19:32,328 --> 00:19:34,914
What a pathetic leader
you turned out to be.

246
00:19:47,469 --> 00:19:49,596
A spatial magic user.

247
00:19:51,222 --> 00:19:54,267
[YUNO]
You bastard!

248
00:19:56,019 --> 00:19:59,564
[ZENON] I'm still feeling the
effects of my previous fight.

249
00:19:59,647 --> 00:20:04,027
Fortunately, he shouldn't
be a problem anymore.

250
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:07,238
I'd've liked to take this
one, too, but time's up.

251
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:12,494
Over my dead body!

252
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:20,418
Don't let him get away!

253
00:20:20,502 --> 00:20:22,295
[VANESSA]
The world will end!

Please. Devil!

257
00:20:38,144 --> 00:20:39,896
I'll let you claim
another part of my body

258
00:20:39,979 --> 00:20:42,107
if that's what it'll take!

259
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:44,943
Please, I need to borrow
your powers again!

--[DEVIL] No.
--[gasps]

261

[DEVIL] Your body can't
even move anymore.

262
00:20:53,868 --> 00:20:57,747
It doesn't matter how desperate
you are to keep fighting.

263
00:20:57,831 --> 00:21:01,501
You wouldn't be able
to handle another deal.

264
00:21:01,584 --> 00:21:05,672
So that's it, then? No deal?

265
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:11,761
[DEVIL] That's right.
Because you're weak.

we need from the Clover Kingdom.

No. They have Yami.
