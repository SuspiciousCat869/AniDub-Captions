1
00:00:13,916 --> 00:00:15,708
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:18,416
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:24,375
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:26,958
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,625
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:39,541
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,416
[NARRATOR] The Royal Knights
had begun to invade

8
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,625
the Eye of the
Midnight Sun's hideout.

9
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:48,958
Their hope was to find Licht
in the innermost chamber

10
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:51,583
and end the fighting
once and for all.

11
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:54,041
Meanwhile, the Black
Bulls' headquarters

12
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:55,791
were under siege
by a powerful group

13
00:00:55,875 --> 00:01:00,666
of enemies led by Rades.
Sally, and Valtos.

14
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,083
Though they fought bravely
to protect their home,

15
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:05,708
Grey, Gordon, and Gauche
found themselves

16
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:08,416
outnumbered and overpowered
by the marauders.

17
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,791
[GORDON]
Don't give up yet, Gauche.

18
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:11,000
[gasps]

19
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:17,500
[BOTH] No matter what,
we'll protect our hideout!

20
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:19,041
[RADES]
Here comes the finishing blow!

21
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:21,625
[alarm rings]

22
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:25,291
[VOICE 89A]
Emergency. Emergency.

23
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:36,833
What is all this?

24
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:14,375
[VALTOS] What's all the
commotion? That damn Rades.

25
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:17,208
It seems he's on
the warpath again.

26
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:20,833
[GAUCHE]
Hey, who are you?

27
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:25,208
Yeah, and what are you
doing inside our hideout?

28
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:26,458
[mumbling] He's creepy.

29
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:28,083
You're creepy!

30
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,750
Now, you! Tell me who you are!

31
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:36,291
Certainly. My name is...

32
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:37,666
[GAUCHE]
So slow!

33
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,125
[GAUCHE]
Look, just tell us your name

34
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:41,166
and what you're
doing here, all right?

35
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,333
[HENRY]
The truth is...

36
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:45,041
No offense, Gauche,
but I think he was

37
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,750
about to explain before
you interrupted him!

38
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,666
--[GAUCHE] Yeah, so?
--[SALLY] Wait a sec.

39
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,041
I thought there were
only supposed to be

40
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:53,000
three Magic Knights in
the Black Bulls' hideout,

41
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:54,458
so where'd he come from?

42
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:56,958
I don't care where
he came from, Sally.

43
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:59,375
Our plan is the same either way.

44
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:02,000
We'll kill everyone in our path!

45
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,791
Crush them, Mikael Caesar!

46
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,458
--What the--?
--[SALLY whistles]

47
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:13,958
[mumbling] Impressive.

48
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:16,666
[GAUCHE] He moved the building
around to dodge that?

49
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,750
[RADES]
What the hell did you do?

50
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:24,916
Where was I?
Oh, yes, my name is...

51
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Don't start over!

52
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:27,291
Come on!

53
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:30,958
[GAUCHE]
Come to think of it...

54
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:32,916
Charmy and Vanessa did
say there was a ghost

55
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,250
rearranging the place,
didn't they?

56
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:38,625
Don't tell me...
There really was a ghost?

57
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:40,458
And this is him?

58
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:42,333
[mumbling] No, Gauche,
this is definitely a living,

59
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:44,500
breathing human.
I can feel it in my bones.

60
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:46,000
How do you just "feel" that?

61
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:47,916
And why can I suddenly
understand everything

62
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,916
that comes out of
your creepy mouth?

63
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,416
Man, I'm good!

64
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:55,375
His hair moves!

65
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:57,541
[laughs]

66
00:04:57,625 --> 00:05:02,041
Hello there. You're all
so nice and warm.

67
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,708
Okay, I wasn't expecting that!

68
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:06,291
He's got a whole family
of birds in there.

69
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,416
[mumbling] Look at all
those friends, he's lucky!

70
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,083
Heh! I don't know what
your big fancy power is,

71
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:15,250
but destroying a building is
no way to attack or defend!

72
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:17,083
Allow my friend to show you why!

73
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:19,041
[MIKAEL CAESAR growls]

74
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:20,333
[ALL gasp]

75
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:31,250
[gasps] More shaking!
What is this?

76
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:39,500
Holy--! He just blocked that?

77
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:43,333
That's pretty amazing!
Like a giant hand almost!

78
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:45,416
[RADES]
Don't look so impressed!

79
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,291
Look at him go.

80
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:49,666
He's manipulating
the pieces with magic!

81
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,375
[mumbling] I'm proud of my new
friend, he's doing a great job.

82
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:56,708
Cease your attacks. Right now...

83
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:58,625
[RADES]
Will you please spit it out?

84
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:00,708
We can't go on
like this all day!

85
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:02,125
[GAUCHE]
This reminds me of that old guy

86
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:04,125
back at the Underwater Temple.

87
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:06,125
It's like his Game Magic.

88
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:09,291
Spells that control
certain things and places!

89
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:11,250
And the longer you've been
familiar with whatever

90
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:13,458
you're controlling,
the more magic power

91
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:16,500
you're able to pour
into it over time!

92
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:18,458
To produce a spell this massive,

93
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:20,708
he would have had
to be here for a while.

94
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:23,166
The building's been
reshuffling itself for ages.

95
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,791
Has he been living under
our noses for that long?

96
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:28,458
Right, that explains everything!

97
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:34,500
Gordon, Gauche, and Grey.

98
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:36,000
I'll help.

99
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:38,208
[BOTH gasp]

100
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:41,291
Hang on. You know who we are?

101
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:47,541
Of course I do. Because I...

102
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:50,083
...live here, too.

103
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:57,375
You must be that mysterious
ghost I've been hearin' about.

104
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:03,375
Actually, sir,
I'm not a ghost at all.

105
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:05,708
Cool. Well, my name is Yami.

106
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:07,458
I'm a brand-new
Magic Knight Captain

107
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,166
and I'm lookin' for a hideout.

108
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,500
This place seems
to be a good fit.

109
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:13,791
It's got a nice feel to it.

110
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:17,833
Anyway, I assume it's yours,
so could you hand it over?

111
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:20,500
[HENRY]
I wanted to say, "why not?"

112
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:22,958
But, unfortunately, I was
born with a rare disease

113
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:25,166
that makes it difficult to move,

114
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,208
so I explained the situation.

115
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:34,166
[HENRY] You see, I can only
survive inside this house.

116
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,500
I can't be around
people, either.

117
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:39,041
But, I also can't
live without people,

118
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,750
or their power, at least.

119
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:43,416
My body absorbs it little
by little from anyone

120
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,541
who spends time near me.

121
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:47,250
My parents had
disappeared a few months

122
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:48,833
before he showed up.

123
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:51,166
Something may have
happened to them

124
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,750
or maybe they'd abandoned me.

125
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:56,208
I mean, who would want
to waste their time

126
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:59,750
on a burden like me? That
was what I thought, anyway.

127
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:02,875
I knew I would die soon,
so I asked him if he could

128
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:06,833
wait to take over the building
until after that. But, well...

129
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:08,708
Nah, that won't work.

130
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:09,958
[HENRY]
Huh?

131
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:11,625
Makin' a hideout in
a place where somebody

132
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:15,375
kicked the bucket is too creepy,
not to mention unlucky.

133
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:18,250
You should live.
It's more convenient.

134
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,291
But... I...

135
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:21,791
I mean, think about it.

136
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:23,583
If there's a buncha rowdy
Magic Knights causin' a ruckus

137
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:27,791
all the time, it might even
make you feel better.

138
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,416
[HENRY] I understand that
you don't know me.

139
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:36,125
[HENRY] But I've gotten to
know each of you very well.

140
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:41,125
[HENRY] And even though
you never realized it,

141
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:45,125
you've all been keeping me
alive for a long time now.

142
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:48,708
I suppose we've never
been properly introduced.

143
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:54,291
But... you're my
cherished friends.

144
00:08:54,375 --> 00:09:02,500
Anyway, you can
call me... Henry.

145
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,583
[BOTH]
Henry, huh?

146
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:07,791
[mumbling] What a great name.

147
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:09,500
I'll make a Henry
doll right away!

148
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:13,333
I don't give a damn who you are,
you pathetic little freak!

149
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:15,333
I'll demolish that
rundown building,

150
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:17,375
and crush you along with it!

151
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:22,333
I won't let you do that.

152
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:30,208
[VALTOS] I sense mana
coming from this area.

153
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:35,916
[VALTOS]
That's it. The same one.

154
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:42,166
The magic stone Heath
failed to recover

155
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,875
from Saussy Village some time
ago was here, after all.

156
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:47,708
I still can't believe it.

157
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:49,125
At long last...

158
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:51,833
[rumbling]

159
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:53,125
Again?

160
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:06,250
[BOTH gasp]

161
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:18,750
[HENRY] Recombination Magic:
The Raging Black Bull!

162
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:21,833
This won't stand.

163
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:25,083
[HENRY] I won't let anyone get
away with hurting them.

164
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:28,916
[HENRY]
These are my squadmates!

165
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:41,416
[GAUCHE gasps]
He turned it into a weapon!

166
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,916
It's impossible!

167
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,916
That was awesome!
How'd he pull that off?

168
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,875
He needs to be my
new test subject!

169
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:50,500
[whimpering]

170
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,708
[GORDON mumbling] That's my
best friend Henry for you!

171
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:54,500
It's gotta take a
crazy amount of power

172
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:56,291
to move something that big!

173
00:10:56,375 --> 00:11:01,333
The strength I use doesn't
only come from me!

174
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:03,791
It comes from everyone.

175
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:09,791
I store it all up, and then
I release it in one blast!

176
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:12,750
What you see here
is the mana power

177
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:15,250
of all the Black Bulls together!

178
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:16,833
[GREY]
Huh?

179
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:21,833
[HENRY] I was bedridden,
but a few years ago,

180
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:27,000
I gathered all of my energy
to wander the hideout,

181
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:29,291
all thanks to you.

182
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,166
[GAUCHE] Okay, so you really
are the ghost who's been

183
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,041
creeping around this place!

184
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:37,416
[HENRY] I can't control
my condition very well yet.

185
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,708
If we get too close,
I might suck away too much

186
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:43,750
of your magic power,
so we can't really

187
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:47,291
meet face-to-face. But...

188
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,333
[gasps]

189
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,916
[HENRY]
There was one kid who got lost

190
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,416
and wound up finding my room.

191
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,500
I explained that he should
be careful around me,

192
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:01,541
but all he said was,

193
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:03,750
"Don't worry about
taking my magic,

194
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:05,625
'cause I don't have any!"

195
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:11,166
After that, he came by to
visit every now and then.

196
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:14,916
You see, I'm one of you.

197
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,041
I am a member
of the Black Bulls.

198
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:19,333
Uh-oh.

199
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:21,791
I can feel my magic power
drainin' like crazy.

200
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,125
I better get goin'.

201
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:27,000
Anyway, guess I'll be makin'
ya part of the squad, then.

202
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,583
[HENRY gasps]

203
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,708
[YAMI] Once you're able
to move around some,

204
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:34,916
if you ever wanna
protect your team,

205
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,958
just put that robe on.

206
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:45,166
[HENRY] When I want
to protect my team...

207
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,333
[ALL gasp]

208
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:51,833
[HENRY]
That time is now!

209
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:53,583
You're kidding me!

210
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:55,541
He's a Black Bull?

211
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:58,083
So what if you've
got bigger toys?

212
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:02,375
You're still no match
for my Number Zero!

213
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:05,541
[HENRY]
Go, Mana Corkscrew!

214
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:10,625
[MIKAEL CAESAR groans]

215
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:13,208
What? Where'd that come from?

216
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,791
Mana Rocket Punch!

217
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:25,666
[GAUCHE, GORDON, GREY] What kind
of crazy magic battle is this?

218
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,583
[RADES]
Get it together, Mikael Caesar!

219
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:30,500
I made you. I know you
can do better than that!

220
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:34,500
What's the holdup? Dust
yourself off and get back to it!

221
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:36,416
[SALLY] Hey, I know
he's a lifeless corpse

222
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,041
that feels no pain and all,

223
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:40,166
but if he takes a couple
more big attacks like that,

224
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,041
he's gonna end up double-dead.

225
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:46,333
I'd sure love to get a peek
at that guy's organs.

226
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:48,666
My research has really
paid off lately.

227
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,916
[SALLY]
I'll show them.

228
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Dark Magic Item:
Magic Scorpion Necklace!

229
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:58,791
This'll increase
my power tenfold!

230
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:01,750
Even if it's only
for ten minutes!

231
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:05,250
[screams]

232
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:08,208
[SALLY]
Gel Magic!

233
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:16,208
Say hello to the Big Ol'
Sticky Salamander!

234
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:17,375
[GAUCHE]
Dammit, that's the one way

235
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:19,708
she could've made
that thing worse!

236
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:30,458
Hope you're ready,
because here I come!

237
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:36,250
[HENRY] Of course.
Go, Raging Black Bull!

238
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:40,333
[HENRY]
Mana Corkscrew!

239
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:44,791
Oh, no!

240
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:46,083
You can throw all
the punches you like,

241
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:49,666
but it won't do
any good! [laughs]

242
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,500
Wanna see something cool?

243
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:55,916
Behold! Dark Magic Item:

[yelps]

246
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:11,583
That unique ability
of yours is one thing,

247
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:15,541
but your odd constitution
really intrigues me!

248
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:18,083
Let's see, what to do next...

249
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:22,250
[cackles] Attagirl,
Sally! Finish him off!

250
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:24,000
Come on, we have to help!

251
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:25,416
There isn't much time left!

252
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,250
[mumbling] We're on
the way, best friend!

253
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:30,125
But, how do we stop that thing?

254
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:31,500
[GAUCHE]
The spells Gordon and I have

255
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,833
won't be effective
against her Gel Magic.

256
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:36,416
You'll have to change its
attribute to something else!

257
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,625
[GREY]
Huh? Are you serious?

258
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:39,916
I'm not good enough
to go up against

259
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,583
a monster that big--
it'll never work!

260
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:43,791
You'll be fine.
I'll take the lead!

261
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,875
Um, okay!

262
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:48,125
Look into my eye!

263
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:50,083
[GREY yelps]

264
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:56,208
[GAUCHE]
Mirror Magic: Mirage Brigade!

265
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,500
Did he just turn that
girl into an army?

266
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:02,125
[SALLY]
Check it out!

267
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:05,041
[GREYS]
I'd really prefer if you didn't!

268
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:09,166
'Kay, here we go.
Transformation Magic:

269
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:14,208
[GREYS] Magic Conversion,
from Gel into Plant!

270
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:16,833
[SALLY yelps]

271
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:20,000
[GREYS]
The best way to destroy a plant

272
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:22,125
is with a little poison!

273
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,791
[GREY]
Gordon! It's your turn!

274
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:28,666
[mumbling] A friend in need
is a friend indeed!

275
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:32,416
[GORDON mumbling]
Poison Curse Magic:

276

Dwelling of the Poison Cloud!

00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,208
Nice, Creepy!

278
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:45,083
No more playing around!
Get up, Mikael Caesar!

279
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:46,833
[GAUCHE gasps]

280

[MIKAEL CAESAR growls]

281
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:54,875
[HENRY] Don't you lay
a finger... on my friends!

282
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:05,541
What's he doing now?

283
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:08,541

Yeah!

00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,958

Yeah!

[RADES growls]

286
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:19,750
So it's like that, huh?!

287
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,208
All right, then
we have no choice

288
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:22,541
but to bring out the big guns!

289
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:27,333
Ugh. Not sure why, but I'm
dizzy all of a sudden.

290
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:31,208
I think I might've
overdone it on the mana.

291
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:32,166
[VALTOS]
Wait.

292
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,625
Valtos, you're back?

293
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:34,666
Oh, great.

294
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,875
Has he been in there
the entire time?

295
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:40,708
I've got the item
we wanted. Let's go.

296
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:43,791
[RADES] What are you, crazy?
We can't just up and leave!

297
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:48,041
[VALTOS] For this assignment,
failure will not be tolerated.

298
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:51,583
I won't be swayed by
your selfish whining.

299
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:57,500
[RADES]
Damn you, Black Bulls!

300
00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:00,250
This isn't over yet,
do you hear me?

301
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:03,291
[SALLY] Bye-bye, let's play
again sometime, okay?

302
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:04,625
You punks got lucky!

303
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:07,208
Next time, you're all dead!

[laughs] Everything is as
Master Licht desires.

Stop right there!

00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:18,333
We're not finished with you yet,
Eye of the Midnight Sun!

307
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:22,166
How could we let this happen?

308
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,958
Whatever they stole
from our hideout,

309
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:26,375
they're long gone
with it now!

310
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:27,625
[mumbling] I don't
know what happened,

311
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:29,291
but at least we beat them!

312
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:30,958
Joining forces
with my friends...

313
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:32,541
I'll remember this day fondly.

314
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:35,083
If you ask me, I'm just happy
that everybody's safe

315
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:37,666
and our hideout made it
through the fight okay!

316
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,041
[GAUCHE grunts]

317
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:43,666
[GAUCHE]
You consider this "okay"?

318
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,500
Hey, you can put everything
back together, right?

319
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:49,041
Well, actually...

320
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:51,791
If any one of my Marie
treasures are damaged...

321
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:54,458
I can't help you.

322
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:57,541
[GAUCHE]
Seriously?! Marie!

323
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:58,791
[GORDON mumbling] Tell me
about yourself, Henry,

324
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:01,000
and don't spare a single detail.

325
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:05,000
[GREY] Now I'm too discouraged
to transform myself back!

326
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,541
[VALTOS]
Master Licht.

327
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,250
[RADES]
Sorry for the wait.

328
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,250
I assume you recovered it, then?

329
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,125
It was easy-peasy!

330
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:22,416
Here it is.

331
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:25,291
[LICHT]
Well done.

332
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:33,250
[LILY]
The weather's so nice!

333
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:36,041
[NASH] Yeah, I bet the
laundry'll be dry in no time!

334
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,458
[LILY]
Should be.

335
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:43,333
[YAMI]
I sense somethin'.

336
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:51,958
[LICHT chuckles]

337
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:55,416
[NASH]
Hm? Something wrong, Sister?

338
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,833
Oh, no. I'm fine.

339
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:01,125
[YAMI]
Come on, Goldiguts.

340
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:04,083
Ya ask me to come here,
then you're late showin' up?

341
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:11,375
[LICHT] Only two remain.
And once we have them,

342
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:13,791
the Monument of the
Tree of Life will guide us

343
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:16,916
in awakening our true power.

344
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,750
Our wish is finally
being fulfilled,

345
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:22,083
after waiting so long.

346
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:23,125
Yes.

347
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:24,416
It's about time!

348
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,916
We're gonna waste every last one

349
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,750
of those worthless
Magic Knights!

350
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:30,625
This oughtta be fun!

351
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:33,166
So, where can we find
those other stones?

352
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,500
[SALLY]
Yeah, we'll pick 'em up for you

353
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:36,458
and bring 'em back in a flash!

354
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:37,916
[VALTOS]
Just say the word.

355
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,416
[LICHT]
I appreciate that.

356
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,416
However, I am the
only one who will

357
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,833
be able to recover
the remaining stones.

358
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:47,458
I understand.

359
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:50,041
You take this opportunity
to get some rest.

360
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:53,791
No need to worry.
I'll handle it.

361
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,958
[NARRATOR] As Licht, the Eye
of the Midnight Sun's leader,

362
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:01,291
was steadily preparing
to achieve his ambition.

363
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:03,041
Asta and the rest
of the Royal Knights

364
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:06,208
fought tirelessly
to thwart his efforts.

365
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:09,708
Eye of the Midnight Sun,
this is the end for you.

366
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:11,458
You'll pay, right now!

367
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:12,916
[MEREOLEONA]
This is for my brother!

368
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,625
[NOZEL]
This is for my rival.

369
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:18,125
[NOZEL, MERELEONA]
Fuegoleon!

370
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:21,250
Make no mistake, your
leader's head will be mine!

371
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:24,166
[RHYA] Apparently, we have
a real tricky bunch

372
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:28,083
on our hands. Seeing as
Licht isn't around.

373
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:30,166
This is gonna be a pain.

374
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,208
Guess I'll have to suck it up.

375
00:23:03,666 --> 00:23:05,625

[VALTOS]
"Meanwhile, Valtos."

377
00:23:11,416 --> 00:23:13,250
The magic stone Heath
failed to recover

378
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:17,000
from Saussy Village some time
ago was here, after all.

379
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:18,958
I still can't believe it.

380
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:23,041
--At long last...
--[rumbling]

381
00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:24,291
Again?

00:23:25,666 --> 00:23:27,875
[screams]

383
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:30,250
[VALTOS]
What?!

384
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:32,583
Preposterous!

385
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:36,916
[VALTOS grunting]

386
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:38,833
[VALTOS]
Wait.

387
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:40,541
Valtos, you're back?

388
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:41,708
I've secured the item,

389
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:44,083
but I think I should
lie down now.

390
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:48,750
[LILY] I've got a strange
feeling something

391
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:51,041
terrible might happen soon!

become of our kingdom?
