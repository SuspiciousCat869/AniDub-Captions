1
00:00:23,763 --> 00:00:25,682
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:25,765 --> 00:00:28,518
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:32,105 --> 00:00:34,441
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:34,524 --> 00:00:36,901
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:43,533 --> 00:00:45,535
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:45,618 --> 00:00:49,748
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:51,082 --> 00:00:53,460
[NARRATOR] Continuing their
assault upon humanity,

8
00:00:53,543 --> 00:00:55,754
the ten elves known as
the Apostles of Sephira

9
00:00:55,837 --> 00:00:58,298
brought forth the Shadow
Palace, the border between

10
00:00:58,381 --> 00:01:01,676
this world and the next that
lay inside Clover Castle.

11
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,637
[BAVAL] When we place the final
magic stone into its pedestal

12
00:01:04,721 --> 00:01:07,682
inside the palace, the
elves' great reincarnation

13
00:01:07,766 --> 00:01:09,225
will be complete!

14
00:01:09,309 --> 00:01:12,187
Of course, a price must be paid
for our use of these bodies.

15
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:16,524
Sadly, their human souls will
be sent to the underworld!

16
00:01:16,608 --> 00:01:18,526
[YAMI]
'Kay, so there's a magical space

17
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:19,861
growin' over there.

18
00:01:19,944 --> 00:01:22,864
[cackles] Sounds like our
cue to head that way.

19
00:01:22,947 --> 00:01:24,074
Huh?

20
00:01:26,576 --> 00:01:29,371
[KLAUS] You won't stop
the Apostles of Sephira!

21
00:01:29,454 --> 00:01:30,955
It's one thing after another.

22
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:34,000
Can't these jerks
just give us a break?

23
00:01:35,418 --> 00:01:37,754
[NARRATOR] Fortunately,
reinforcements arrived!

24
00:01:37,837 --> 00:01:39,673
Hey! Is that...?

25
00:01:39,756 --> 00:01:41,883
[BLACK BULLS]
Here we are!

--[ASTA] You guys okay?
--[BLACK BULLS yell]

27

A huge bull? No way!

[laughs] Ya buncha dumbasses!

29
00:01:52,477 --> 00:01:54,396
Better work on that entrance!

30
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,064
[KLAUS]
Curse you, humans!

31
00:01:56,147 --> 00:01:58,108
Bring in whatever
reinforcements you like,

32
00:01:58,191 --> 00:02:00,402
you're still no match
for the elves!

33
00:02:00,485 --> 00:02:01,945
[NARRATOR]
Thanks to Asta and the others,

34
00:02:02,028 --> 00:02:05,365
it appeared as though the
tables had turned, however...

35
00:02:05,448 --> 00:02:07,283
[BLACK BULLS gasp]

36
00:02:07,367 --> 00:02:10,036
Don't tell me this ki
is what I think it is.

37
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,705
[ASTA]
I know her!

38
00:02:11,788 --> 00:02:14,249
That's the captain of
the Coral Peacocks!

39
00:02:14,332 --> 00:02:16,584
Did she get possessed, too?

40

[DOROTHY]
Dream Magic: Glamour World.

[NARRATOR]
Dorothy Unsworth,

42
00:02:22,465 --> 00:02:25,885
captain of the Coral Peacocks,
had also reincarnated as an elf.

43
00:02:25,969 --> 00:02:28,013
She used her magic
to teleport Vanessa

44
00:02:28,096 --> 00:02:30,682
and the others into
the dream world.

45
00:04:04,901 --> 00:04:06,611
[CHARMY]
Wee! Wee!

46
00:04:06,695 --> 00:04:08,988
Cool! Where are we now?

47
00:04:09,072 --> 00:04:10,990
I can't see very well
without my glasses,

48
00:04:11,074 --> 00:04:12,701
but it sure seems fun!

49
00:04:12,784 --> 00:04:14,077
This place is freaky.

50
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,662
Anyone know where
the heck we are?

51
00:04:15,745 --> 00:04:17,872
The captain of the
Coral Peacocks' magic.

52
00:04:17,956 --> 00:04:20,458
I don't know what
else it could be.

53
00:04:20,542 --> 00:04:22,460
[VANESSA]
Rouge wasn't able to evade it

54
00:04:22,544 --> 00:04:25,296
because she couldn't identify
it as an attack spell.

55
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,257
This is the best!

56
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:30,343
It's one of the most powerful
spells a mage can produce!

57
00:04:30,427 --> 00:04:31,553
Man! I'm freaking out!

58
00:04:31,636 --> 00:04:33,805
[MAGNA] Will you please
just reign it in?

59
00:04:34,931 --> 00:04:38,601
[gasps] Wow. This place
goes on forever.

60
00:04:38,685 --> 00:04:40,020
There's no end to it.

61
00:04:40,103 --> 00:04:41,479
Huh? Don't be a moron.

62
00:04:41,563 --> 00:04:43,023
How's that even possible?

63
00:04:43,106 --> 00:04:44,816
It's a lot more likely
than the possibility

64
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:45,859
of you becoming smart!

65
00:04:45,942 --> 00:04:48,737
What the hell did
you say to me?!

66
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,613
You're in the Glamour World now.

67
00:04:50,697 --> 00:04:54,868
In this place, the
impossible becomes real.

[yawns] Everything here
is how I wish it to be.

74
00:05:12,802 --> 00:05:15,388
I don't know what that thing
is, but it's really big!

75
00:05:15,472 --> 00:05:17,349
And it just keeps
getting bigger.

76
00:05:17,432 --> 00:05:20,185
[CHARMY]
I wonder if it's tasty.

77
00:05:20,268 --> 00:05:23,021
[DOROTHY]
I hate to disappoint.

78
00:05:23,104 --> 00:05:27,108
But you have no
chance of winning.

I thought we died.

Get a load of this,
you stupid pig!

86
00:05:50,674 --> 00:05:52,759
[DOROTHY]
The result was altered?

87
00:05:52,842 --> 00:05:56,721
So... that magic really
does influence fate.

88
00:05:56,805 --> 00:05:59,516
That little red cat
is so stinkin' cute!

You're not one of the
Black Bulls, you know.

91
00:06:03,103 --> 00:06:05,230
If you stray too far,
her magic won't affect you.

92
00:06:05,313 --> 00:06:06,106
Be careful.

93
00:06:06,189 --> 00:06:08,650
I get it! Just you guys.

00:06:08,733 --> 00:06:11,361

Think so?

100
00:06:26,751 --> 00:06:28,461
Here, eat! When you use magic,

101
00:06:28,545 --> 00:06:30,797
you have to eat up so
you can recover your mana!

That magic is great!

You wouldn't happen to
be a witch, would you?

No, ma'am. I just really
like to cook and eat.

and absolute evasion.
This won't be easy.

If this ridiculous place
is also a world of magic,

then all we have to do
to get out is defeat her.

We can't both stay stuck here.

00:07:33,068 --> 00:07:36,112
We have to hurry back
to the others.

An ever-flowing pool of water.

160
00:09:10,957 --> 00:09:12,375
Whoa. What just happened?

161
00:09:12,459 --> 00:09:14,502
Ah. I broke the water
down electrically,

162
00:09:14,586 --> 00:09:16,254
and then set fire
to what was left.

163
00:09:16,338 --> 00:09:17,339
[LUCK]
Huh?

164
00:09:17,422 --> 00:09:19,424
Well, if you unleash
Lightning Magic

165
00:09:19,507 --> 00:09:21,676
and Flame Magic on water,
you can create

166
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,721
an explosion big enough to
destroy an entire mountain.

167
00:09:24,804 --> 00:09:25,972
What the--?

168
00:09:26,056 --> 00:09:27,849
How could you make us do
something so reckless?

169
00:09:27,932 --> 00:09:31,311
[laughs] Who cares? You
could evade with the cat!

170
00:09:31,394 --> 00:09:34,397
[LUCK] Ooh, I'll try that
with Noelle's magic next!

171
00:09:34,481 --> 00:09:36,733
Anyway, the experiment
made a few other things

172
00:09:36,816 --> 00:09:37,984
clear to me, too.

173
00:09:38,068 --> 00:09:40,445
First of all, what she's
generating are actual

174
00:09:40,528 --> 00:09:42,572
objects that she's visualized.

175
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:46,034
Which means real-world
principles work on them, too!

176
00:09:46,117 --> 00:09:48,912
Yummy! It's a
real-life, tasty fish!

177
00:09:48,995 --> 00:09:51,373
Secondly, because of
that, she's unable

178
00:09:51,456 --> 00:09:52,916
to manipulate the
spells we cast,

179
00:09:52,999 --> 00:09:56,086
nor can she control the
resulting phenomena.

180
00:09:56,169 --> 00:09:57,379
That makes sense.

181
00:09:57,462 --> 00:09:59,714
Otherwise, that explosion
and Rouge's ability

182
00:09:59,798 --> 00:10:02,133
to manipulate fate
wouldn't have worked.

183
00:10:02,217 --> 00:10:05,679
And, then... thirdly...

184
00:10:05,762 --> 00:10:08,598
It's still going to be really
difficult to beat her.

185
00:10:10,517 --> 00:10:12,519
Jeez! You think she'd
ease up a little!

186
00:10:12,602 --> 00:10:15,980
We had better hurry up and
find a way outta this place!

187
00:10:16,064 --> 00:10:18,775
Sorry. You don't have
that kind of time.

188
00:10:18,858 --> 00:10:20,777
[CHARMY groans]

189
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,904
Charmy?

190
00:10:22,987 --> 00:10:24,322
I'm so sleepy.

191
00:10:24,406 --> 00:10:28,827
Hey! What are you talking about?
This is no time for...

192
00:10:30,453 --> 00:10:31,788
[yawns]

193
00:10:31,871 --> 00:10:34,833
[SALLY]
Uh-oh.

194
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,960
Oh, no, this is...

195
00:10:37,043 --> 00:10:38,503
How unfortunate.

196
00:10:38,586 --> 00:10:41,047
You can't evade the drowsiness.

197
00:10:41,131 --> 00:10:42,632
That's how it is.

198
00:10:42,716 --> 00:10:44,718
Everything that exists
in Glamour World

199
00:10:44,801 --> 00:10:48,388
will eventually get
drowsy. Worse yet,

200
00:10:48,471 --> 00:10:52,392
those who fall asleep
will never awaken again.

201
00:10:52,475 --> 00:10:54,394
Who are you talking to? Ow.

202
00:10:54,477 --> 00:10:57,731
I managed to stay awake during
all of Yami's all-nighters!

203
00:10:57,814 --> 00:10:59,107
This is nothing!

204
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,775
[yawns]

205
00:11:00,859 --> 00:11:02,027
This isn't good.

206
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:04,779
I don't know what we can
do to evade this attack!

207
00:11:04,863 --> 00:11:07,365
[DOROTHY] You will sink
into the sleep of death.

208
00:11:07,449 --> 00:11:09,617
For in this enchanted space,

209
00:11:09,701 --> 00:11:10,994
you cannot resist.

210
00:11:11,077 --> 00:11:12,954
[yawns]

211
00:11:13,038 --> 00:11:14,956
[SALLY] Aw, everything
was already blurry--

212
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,958
now it's getting even blurrier.

213
00:11:17,042 --> 00:11:20,670
Not having my
glasses really sucks.

214
00:11:20,754 --> 00:11:21,546
Oh, yeah!

215
00:11:21,629 --> 00:11:23,506
[SALLY]
Hey!

216
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:24,716
Check it out!

217
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,551
Do you have any idea
what these are?

218
00:11:26,634 --> 00:11:29,679
If not, I'll tell ya.
Glasses! Like 'em?

219
00:11:29,763 --> 00:11:31,973
What are you babbling
on about glasses for?

220
00:11:32,057 --> 00:11:34,476
Now's not the time
to worry abou--

221
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:35,935
Yay! Look!

222
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:37,395
--[MAGNA] What?
--[VANESSA] Huh?

223
00:11:37,479 --> 00:11:38,855
She just made those.

224
00:11:38,938 --> 00:11:40,732
Where did those come from?

225
00:11:40,815 --> 00:11:43,276
Everything in this world
does as she sees fit.

226
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,403
That's why the objects
that she visualized

227
00:11:45,487 --> 00:11:49,532
in her head materialized.
Now, if you ask me...

228
00:11:49,616 --> 00:11:53,912
What this world needs most
is an exit, exit, exit!

229
00:11:53,995 --> 00:11:56,331
Make one, please?

230
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,296
[laughs] It's hard to
not think of something

231
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,507
once your mind has
already visualized it.

232
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:08,009
Hooray for the
power of suggestion!

233
00:12:08,093 --> 00:12:09,386
Aw, hell yeah!

234
00:12:09,469 --> 00:12:12,180
She's only invincible in
this dumb Glamour World!

235
00:12:12,263 --> 00:12:14,891
If we can escape it,
we'll figure this out.

236
00:12:28,822 --> 00:12:30,824
[YAMI]
Tch. What the heck's goin' on?

237
00:12:30,907 --> 00:12:33,868
It's all the same,
no matter how far we go.

238
00:12:33,952 --> 00:12:36,788
We can't even find any
walls, let alone Licht.

239
00:12:36,871 --> 00:12:39,040
Then there's the faint
ki that I'm feeling.

240
00:12:39,124 --> 00:12:40,333
Dammit, you think that--

241
00:12:40,417 --> 00:12:43,795
[JACK cackles] Looks to me
like someone's magic

242
00:12:43,878 --> 00:12:46,798
is causing us to lose our way.

243
00:12:46,881 --> 00:12:49,884
Huh. So, I guess
you noticed it, too?

244
00:12:49,968 --> 00:12:51,177
Beanpole weirdo.

245
00:12:51,261 --> 00:12:54,764
Right back at you. Ya meathead.

246
00:12:54,848 --> 00:12:56,808
They've got some
nerve hiding from us.

247
00:12:56,891 --> 00:12:59,811
I'm impatient. I want
to dice them up already!

248
00:12:59,894 --> 00:13:00,812
Let me have 'em.

249
00:13:00,895 --> 00:13:02,564
No, they're mine to slash up!

250
00:13:02,647 --> 00:13:04,941
I found them first,
it's only fair that I do it.

251
00:13:05,025 --> 00:13:07,777
What are you talking about?
I found them first!

252
00:13:07,861 --> 00:13:08,611
I did!

253
00:13:08,695 --> 00:13:09,696
It was me!

254
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:12,073
Ugh, you are such
a pain in the ass!

255
00:13:12,157 --> 00:13:15,076
[cackles] The early bird
slashes the worm!

256
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,703
[BOTH]
They're right there!

257
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,790
What are you slashing,
you jerk?

258
00:13:20,874 --> 00:13:22,375
The enemy's totally right there!

259
00:13:22,459 --> 00:13:23,543
No way!

260
00:13:23,626 --> 00:13:25,837
Don't be dumb, they're
right over there!

261
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,257
I mean. Do you not even
know how to hit an enemy?

262
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:32,344
Well, you didn't
hit anything, either!

263
00:13:32,427 --> 00:13:34,471
Ugh, whatever! I am
officially done with you!

264
00:13:34,554 --> 00:13:36,306
[JACK]
That's my line, stupid beefcake!

265
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:37,182
Go over there!

266
00:13:37,265 --> 00:13:38,016
[YAMI]
No, you go!

267
00:13:38,099 --> 00:13:39,225
[JACK]
No, you!

268
00:13:39,309 --> 00:13:41,770
[BAVAL] Yikes! That was
too close for comfort.

269
00:13:41,853 --> 00:13:43,605
Though, I suppose,
in my warped space,

270
00:13:43,688 --> 00:13:46,274
they were both correct,
technically speaking.

271
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:48,193
Thank goodness I rolled a six.

272
00:13:48,276 --> 00:13:51,946
That should keep them
busy for a little while.

273
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,823
With Dice Magic,
the higher the number,

274
00:13:53,907 --> 00:13:56,910
the more effective it will be
in the situation at hand.

275
00:13:56,993 --> 00:13:58,286
I won't let anyone
get in the way

276
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,955
of the Apostles of Sephira.

277
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:02,707
I would appreciate
it if these two

278
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:05,585
could keep quiet
just a bit longer.

279
00:14:12,092 --> 00:14:13,718
[ASTA grunts]

280
00:14:13,802 --> 00:14:18,723
[whimpers] There's no way
I can keep this up anymore!

281
00:14:18,807 --> 00:14:21,851
Their overall power is
much higher than ours.

282
00:14:22,852 --> 00:14:29,818
I'm... about to...
reach my limit...

283
00:14:29,901 --> 00:14:32,529
This is pointless.
Just give up already.

284
00:14:32,612 --> 00:14:37,200
[ASTA grunts] I don't think
so! We're not done yet!

285
00:14:37,283 --> 00:14:38,451
Right!

286
00:14:40,829 --> 00:14:44,207
[ASTA]
What should I do? Think!

287
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:47,627
If only I could get into
my dark form. But...

288
00:14:47,711 --> 00:14:50,088
I don't think he's gonna
give me a chance for that.

289
00:14:52,966 --> 00:14:55,927
[NOELLE]
Asta and the others...

290
00:14:56,011 --> 00:14:59,014
[MIMOSA] I hate that
all we can do is watch.

291

[MARIE]
Big Brother.

292
00:15:00,598 --> 00:15:01,933
I know.

293
00:15:02,017 --> 00:15:05,103
We must keep Licht and everyone
waiting a bit longer.

294
00:15:05,186 --> 00:15:07,731
Eclat. You know what to do.

295
00:15:07,814 --> 00:15:09,149
[MARIE]
Mm.

296
00:15:11,276 --> 00:15:12,152
Here we go.

297
00:15:12,235 --> 00:15:13,486
[ASTA grunts]

298
00:15:15,947 --> 00:15:17,157
Huh?

[ASTA]
This spell...

302
00:15:22,203 --> 00:15:25,290
It's the same one Gauche
used to avoid attacks!

303
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,752
[ASTA yelping]

304

[GAUCHE]
Yes, come right this way, kid.

305
00:15:31,546 --> 00:15:33,506
Licht's Demon-Destroyer Sword.

306

It severs cause-and-effect
relationships nearby.

307
00:15:36,926 --> 00:15:38,845
He can nullify
Eclat's eye magic,

308
00:15:38,928 --> 00:15:41,389
so I'll get rid of him first.

309

Look here.

310
00:15:46,394 --> 00:15:47,604
No, thank you!

311
00:15:47,687 --> 00:15:51,191
Can you evade attacks
with your eyes closed?

312
00:15:51,274 --> 00:15:54,652
[ASTA]
I can, with ki!

313
00:15:54,736 --> 00:15:57,447
In that case... How about this?

314
00:16:01,076 --> 00:16:04,788
[ASTA]
There's so many. Not good!

00:16:10,126 --> 00:16:14,130
We're going to save him!

318
00:16:14,214 --> 00:16:16,758
Go!

319
00:16:22,013 --> 00:16:25,684
I'm going to rip right through
that pitiful attempt.

320
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,036
What?

321
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,080
[ALL gasp]

322
00:16:47,163 --> 00:16:49,791
Here we go. Now I can fight!

323
00:16:55,672 --> 00:16:57,048
You're mine!

324
00:16:57,132 --> 00:16:59,217
[ASTA yells]

325
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,468
You just...

326
00:17:02,345 --> 00:17:04,472
[GAUCHE, MARIE]
...looked.

327
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:08,309
[ASTA] The magic item
in his left eye. Crap!

328
00:17:08,393 --> 00:17:10,895
[GAUCHE]
I've had enough of you, brat.

329

[ASTA yelps]

330
00:17:12,397 --> 00:17:14,816
[GAUCHE] I will destroy
every piece of you,

331
00:17:14,899 --> 00:17:17,360
so you can't fight us again.

332
00:17:17,444 --> 00:17:18,903
[ASTA grunting]

333
00:17:18,987 --> 00:17:21,072
[ASTA] I'll never undo
the binding spell in time.

334
00:17:21,156 --> 00:17:21,990
There's no way!

335
00:17:22,073 --> 00:17:23,575
Asta's in trouble!

336
00:17:23,658 --> 00:17:25,660
[GREY]
Oh, no, and my magic can't reach

337
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:27,704
nearly that high up!

338
00:17:31,624 --> 00:17:33,126
[NOELLE]
Asta!

339
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:39,507
Goodbye now.

340
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:43,595
[HENRY]
We're here, Asta!

341
00:17:43,678 --> 00:17:46,348
Poison Magic: Violet Schirm!

342

[GREY]
Transformation Magic:

343

Magic Conversion,

344
00:17:53,146 --> 00:17:55,857
I owe ya one, guys, thanks!

345
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:58,318
That actually wasn't too bad.

346
00:18:00,153 --> 00:18:01,071
[HENRY grunts]

347
00:18:01,154 --> 00:18:05,867
[GORDON, GREY yelp]

[pants]

349
00:18:09,954 --> 00:18:11,289
[HENRY]
Just as we thought.

350
00:18:11,373 --> 00:18:15,543
Gauche is way stronger than
usual like this. Still.

351
00:18:19,297 --> 00:18:22,550
Come on, now. Move!

352
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:24,636
[HENRY] Together, the
three of us can do this.

353
00:18:24,719 --> 00:18:26,805
I'm still able to fight!

354
00:18:28,848 --> 00:18:33,019
[panting]

355
00:18:33,103 --> 00:18:34,771
[GORDON]
Henry!

356
00:18:34,854 --> 00:18:37,732
That was close!
You okay in there?

357
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:41,945
I'm... all right!

358
00:18:44,447 --> 00:18:45,865
[HENRY]
Come on, magic.

359
00:18:45,949 --> 00:18:50,328
Please hold out just a little
longer. That's all I ask!

360
00:18:52,539 --> 00:18:54,582
[NARRATOR] Many mages
use magic to reinforce

361
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:57,961
their natural defenses,
and Henry is no exception.

362
00:18:58,044 --> 00:19:01,715
But, in Henry's case,
his very life depends on it.

363
00:19:01,798 --> 00:19:05,343
His blood vessels, muscles,
and organs are incredibly frail.

364
00:19:05,427 --> 00:19:07,429
He will die unless
he continually

365
00:19:07,512 --> 00:19:09,764
reinforces them with magic.

366
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:12,308
However, he'd been
granted a constitution

367
00:19:12,392 --> 00:19:14,728
that absorbed magical power.

368
00:19:14,811 --> 00:19:20,150
One which enabled him
to gain it from others.

369
00:19:20,233 --> 00:19:23,028
Despite being born into
a renowned noble line,

370
00:19:23,111 --> 00:19:25,196
his body was deemed too frail.

371
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,240
His family, and the
rest of the world,

372
00:19:27,323 --> 00:19:29,868
could not accept him
for what he was.

373
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:32,328
This can't be!

374
00:19:32,412 --> 00:19:34,497
If we continue to
harbor that thing,

375
00:19:34,581 --> 00:19:37,667
it will only bring disgrace
to the great name of Legolant.

376
00:19:37,751 --> 00:19:40,337
[HENRY'S MOTHER] How can you
speak of our child that way?

377
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,380
[HENRY'S FATHER]
We have no other choice!

378
00:19:42,464 --> 00:19:44,215
This is for our family.

379
00:19:44,299 --> 00:19:45,925
[NARRATOR]
Placing too much value on status

380
00:19:46,009 --> 00:19:47,552
can warp one's morals.

381
00:19:47,635 --> 00:19:49,637
Henry's parents gave
him very little.

382
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:51,723
A house in the forest
that stored up magic

383
00:19:51,806 --> 00:19:53,933
but remained unseen by others.

384
00:19:54,017 --> 00:19:56,770
A sad and lonely existence.

385
00:19:56,853 --> 00:19:59,147
[HENRY]
This is just as it should be.

386
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:02,942
All I ever do is cause
trouble for people.

387
00:20:03,026 --> 00:20:05,987
You must be that mysterious
ghost I've been hearin' about.

388
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:11,701
Actually, sir... I'm not...
a ghost... at all.

389
00:20:11,785 --> 00:20:14,079
Cool, well. My name is Yami.

390
00:20:14,162 --> 00:20:15,872
I'm a brand-new
Magic Knight Captain,

391
00:20:15,955 --> 00:20:17,540
and I'm lookin' for a hideout.

392
00:20:17,624 --> 00:20:20,210
This place seems
to be a good fit.

393
00:20:20,293 --> 00:20:22,212
[HENRY]
Before he came to me that day,

394
00:20:22,295 --> 00:20:23,963
I was basically dead.

395
00:20:24,047 --> 00:20:26,966
[YAMI] You should live.
It's more convenient.

396
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:28,760
But... I...

397
00:20:28,843 --> 00:20:30,095
I mean, think about it.

398
00:20:30,178 --> 00:20:31,721
If there's a buncha rowdy
Magic Knights causin'

399
00:20:31,805 --> 00:20:35,475
a ruckus all the time; it might
even make you feel better.

400
00:20:35,558 --> 00:20:36,976
[HENRY] That's how my
house became the hideout

401
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:43,066
for the Black Bulls. And up
until that moment, I was...

402
00:20:44,275 --> 00:20:48,363
[pants]

403
00:20:48,446 --> 00:20:51,950
[HENRY] I'm alive today,
and it's all because of them.

404
00:20:52,033 --> 00:20:53,827
That's why I feel this way.

405
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:55,161
I don't care what happens to me!

406
00:20:55,245 --> 00:20:59,290
[ASTA yelling]

407
00:21:02,502 --> 00:21:06,131

escape Eclat's binding.

408
00:21:06,214 --> 00:21:09,050
[ASTA] I'm gonna stop
you two, no matter what.

409

I will turn you back into
the normal Gauche and Marie!

410
00:21:14,848 --> 00:21:19,144
[HENRY] Yes. I will
save him at all costs.

411
00:21:19,227 --> 00:21:21,187
I don't care what happens to me.

412
00:21:21,271 --> 00:21:24,357
I'll save my friend! I swear!

416
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:09,045
I will turn you back into

417
00:23:09,129 --> 00:23:11,131
No, my name is Droit.

418
00:23:11,214 --> 00:23:12,966
My name is Eclat.

419
00:23:13,049 --> 00:23:15,719
And we are never going
to turn back now.

420
00:23:15,802 --> 00:23:17,804
[GAUCHE] But... I would
like to learn more about

421
00:23:17,887 --> 00:23:20,390
this human named Gauche.

422
00:23:20,473 --> 00:23:23,059
This doll that looks
just like Eclat.

423
00:23:23,143 --> 00:23:25,729
I had it when I reincarnated.

424
00:23:25,812 --> 00:23:28,732
It's just too cute. And these.

425
00:23:28,815 --> 00:23:30,900
The pictures of her
in different outfits.

Oh, sorry, nothin' weird
going on over here. Nope!

430
00:23:42,829 --> 00:23:46,458
[ASTA] Ah! You have a Marie

00:23:47,667 --> 00:23:49,336
Did you... see?

432
00:23:49,419 --> 00:23:51,588
I did.
