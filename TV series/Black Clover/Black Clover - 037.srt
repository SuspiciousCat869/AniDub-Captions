1
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:15,708
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:18,708
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:24,500
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:27,375
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:35,708
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:39,958
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,333
[YAMI] So much for that
super powerful spell

8
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:45,416
of yours, Lineface.

9
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,916
[NARRATOR]
It seemed the Magic Knights

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,583
had finally bested the Eye of
the Midnight Sun's leader.

11
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:52,291
Until the Third Eye appeared--

12
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:54,791
the organization's
three strongest members.

13
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:56,208
Oh, man.

14
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:58,750
Looks like something
didn't go as planned.

15
00:00:58,833 --> 00:01:01,541
Do you know what we do to
people who harm our friends?

16
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:04,291
I detest anybody
who hurts Licht.

17
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:06,541
--I hate them.
--[NARRATOR] Rhya the Disloyal.

18
00:01:06,625 --> 00:01:09,541
Vetto the Despair.
And Fana Hateful.

19
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:11,833
I know you'll succeed
where I failed.

20
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:13,666
Thank you, my friends.

21
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:14,833
[NARRATOR]
The Black Bulls swiftly

22
00:01:14,916 --> 00:01:17,125
found themselves outmatched.

23
00:01:17,208 --> 00:01:19,333
Now, let's get this over with.

24
00:01:19,416 --> 00:01:20,375
Hah!

25
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:24,125
Spirit Magic:
Salamander's Breath.

26
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:26,875
[NARRATOR] But then, the captain
of the Green Praying Mantises,

27
00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:29,166
Jack the Ripper,
Blue Rose Knights captain

28
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,666
Charlotte Roselei,
and Silver Eagles captain

29
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:35,375
Nozel Silva arrived, turning
the tide of battle once again.

30
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:37,916
You're having way too much fun
on your own here, Yami.

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,875
You should let the
rest of us in on it.

32
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:17,083
Get some rest. I'm so
glad you're home.

33
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:20,208
And then, that woman
turned Baro into a giant,

34
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:22,250
living mass of mud.

35
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:23,500
I see.

36
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:25,333
It sounds to me like the
Eye of the Midnight Sun

37
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:29,333
was using you and your brother
for their own purposes.

38
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:30,916
I guess.

39
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,458
But we were still the ones who
abducted all of those children.

40
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:36,083
We were the ones who
stole their magic.

41
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:37,416
And so now,

42
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,291
I'm going to take
responsibility for my actions

43
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:42,125
as well as my brother's.

44
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,333
I'll turn myself in
to the Magic Knights.

45
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:45,083
Uh--

46
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:46,375
That's right.

47
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:50,041
Earlier, back in the cave,
Asta said something.

48
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:52,750
Good, and once you get
that outta the way,

49
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,291
you and I should be friends.

50
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:55,750
With all the cool
magic you can do,

51
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:58,708
I bet you're gonna be
a pretty popular guy.

52
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:02,291
We'll be friends.
I am truly sorry.

53
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:05,708
[NOELLE] Ugh! There's hardly
any point apologizing to me!

54
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:06,958
Once you're done
paying your dues,

55
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,916
you're going to be
Asta's friend, right?

56
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,750
So if I were you,
I would start praying

57
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,291
for your new buddy
to win his fight

58
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:14,625
and get back here in one piece.

59
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:17,833
Honestly, Asta.

60
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:21,916
What are you doing out there?
Finish it up already.

61
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,375
[NEIGE]
Asta. Please stay safe.

62
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:26,625
[gasps]

63
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:28,000
[NOELLE] I mean...
Not that it matters to me

64
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,791
what happens to that insect,

65
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:33,125
because it totally doesn't.
Not in the slightest.

66
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:35,625
Ugh! Why does this
keep happening?

67
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,500
And who am I even talking to?

68
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,833
[REBECCA]
She likes Asta, too?

69
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:44,041
Is that the someone special
he's got his heart set on?

70
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:48,291
There's no way he'd notice me
with someone like her around.

71
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:49,541
No.

72
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:52,125
This isn't the time to
be thinking about that.

73
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,416
I should be getting
things ready here

74
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,541
for when they get back.

75
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:58,958
Everything else can wait. Right!

76
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:02,791
Ooh, a second course. Yum.

77
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:05,416
Shame on you. Getting greedy.

78
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,250
It's not polite to hog
all the interesting

79
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:08,916
battles for yourself, you know.

80
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,125
I've gotta wonder.

81
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:12,500
How's it going to feel
to tear them apart?

82
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:14,541
Probably not very satisfying.

83
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,750
Kinda like rippin' up
a sheet of paper.

84
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:18,166
I was just about
to finish 'em off

85
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,833
when you morons
decided to show up.

86
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:23,708
[JACK cackles]
Yeah, I'm sure you were.

87
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:26,041
Looking more ragged
than usual over there.

88
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,375
[YAMI]
Pft. Me? Please.

89
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:30,875
[cackles] How about...

90
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:33,041
...I work out some
of my anger issues

91
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,000
by cutting you into tiny pieces?

92
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:37,833
[YAMI]
And there it is. You're nuts.

93
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:40,375
My sincerest apologies.
Forgive me.

94
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:44,541
[cackles] Scared now? I wasn't
really going to do it.

95
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:47,041
I'd much rather wait until
you're back in fighting shape

96
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:48,916
before our next little skirmish.

97
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,500
There isn't any point
if it's not a challenge.

98
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:54,291
Must we always come to get
you out of trouble?

99
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:57,125
You can't even stand up,
you miserable man

100
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:58,500
[YAMI]
Hey, it's not like that.

101
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:00,333
The ground just loves
my ass so much

102
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:02,416
it doesn't ever wanna let me go.

103
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,833
[CHARLOTTE]
Don't be an idiot.

104
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:05,916
The earth has no love
for an unwashed

105
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,083
miscreant like yourself.

106
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:09,791
[YAMI]
Ooh, burn!

107
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:11,375
That's some mouth you got on ya.

108
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:14,958
Not gonna be easy to find
yourself a husband, huh?

109
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,208
Now she's angry.

110
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:18,375
I don't need any
man to marry me.

111
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:20,708
The battlefield is my partner.

112
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:23,000
I get that you're
a warrior woman and all,

113
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,833
but even for you,
that's pretty sad.

114
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:26,375
[CHARLOTTE grunts]

115
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:30,458
[CHARLOTTE] Does he have
no regard for my feelings?

116
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:32,791
Why? Why did I have
to fall for him?

117
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:35,333
It's like some
kind of cruel joke.

118
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:39,750
But as hard as I try, I can't
keep him out of my head.

119
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:43,041
Well, I certainly can't
tell him anything now.

120
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:46,750
But if I did tell him someday,
what would my squad think?

121
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:48,625
You've gotta be
kidding me, Char!

122
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:52,458
You know he's a man,
right? A gross man!

123
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:56,750
[CHARLOTTE] What am I doing?
Now isn't the time for this!

124
00:06:56,833 --> 00:07:01,125
So the Eye of the Midnight Sun,
its leader, and his top brass.

125
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:03,541
The highest-ranking members
of the organization

126
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:05,625
that attacked our kingdom.

127
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:07,583
I won't waste this chance.

128
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:09,750
I'll bury you with my own hands.

129
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:11,875
Ooh, Nozel, you are so cool!

130
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:15,000
You just sit there and try to
stay out of trouble, foreigner.

131
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:17,541
[YAMI] Your concern for my
well-being is truly touching,

132
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,791
O Great and Mighty Captain.

133
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:20,875
Hey.

134
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:22,458
How do you guys think
he gets his hair

135
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:23,750
to do that braid thing?

136
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:25,958
He's royal, so I figure
he has a servant

137
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:28,000
take care of it for him,
dontcha think?

138
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,541
Honestly, I wouldn't
be surprised

139
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,416
if he had his own
personal hairstylist.

140
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,458
I think that would qualify
as the worst job ever.

141
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:35,833
[ASTA]
What?

142
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:37,375
You think he takes the time
to braid his own bangs?

143
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:39,833
[YAMI] Oh, yeah, he probably
has lots of time on his hands.

144
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:41,000
Loser.

145
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:42,458
No, on second thought,

146
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:45,375
perhaps I ought to bury you
before those other four.

147
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:49,125
[YAMI] You don't wanna waste
your magic on some foreigner.

148
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:51,250
Show no mercy.

149
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:52,666
[JACK cackles]

150
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:56,083
Oh, yeah, let's do this, guys!

151
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:57,833
I'm totally ready to go!

152
00:07:57,916 --> 00:08:00,250
We'll take these
jerks down, no problem!

153
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,083
You won't be joining this fight.

154
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:03,500
Huh?

155
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,166
[NOZEL] The captains have
taken to the battlefield.

156
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:09,166
Anybody who interferes now
will only get in our way.

157
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:12,500
Especially a pathetic,
magicless commoner like you.

158
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:14,583
[VETTO]
Excellent!

159
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,833
What better place
to find true despair

160
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:18,791
than at the end
of an endless battle?

161
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:21,708
And no despair is more delicious
than that of the mighty

162
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:23,375
when they face certain death.

163
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:25,500
The hell's he talkin' about?

164
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:29,125
Looks like we've got
some rat catching to do!

165
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,958
Jeez, Vetto is way too
excited about this fight.

166
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:33,916
Sounds boring to me.

167
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,041
[yawns]

168
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:38,041
Well, whatever.

169
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:41,583
I guess I can put forth
some effort for Licht's sake.

170
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,708
[RHYA]
And by the way, I'm calling dibs

171
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,666
on this beautiful young lady.

172
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,541
When I win, you and I are going
out for a drink, gorgeous.

173
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,083
When <i>you</i> win?

174
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:54,333
I'm afraid we're never going
to be clinking glasses, then.

175
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:56,041
Briar Creation Magic:

176
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:58,625
Corpse-Hunting Briar Trees.

177
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:15,666
Severing Magic: Death Scythe!

178
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:21,000
Someone's eager for a fight.
You're mine, beastie.

179
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,875
Well, well. The
Praying Mantis Squad.

180
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:25,041
Then I'll just squash you

181
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:27,375
like the insignificant
bugs that you are.

182
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:31,500
You think so? Well, we'll see!

183
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:33,958
You're confident
for a bug. Fine.

184
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:37,333
Let's see your smile while I'm
ripping you limb from limb.

185
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:39,458
Go, Bear Claw!

186
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,458
I've been waiting for this.

187
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:42,458
Finally!

188
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:46,125
Mercury Magic: Silver Spears!

189
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:54,000
Yet another foolish person
attempting to harm Licht.

190
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:56,291
For that, you'll die.

191
00:09:57,708 --> 00:10:00,625
[cackles] Looks like
salamander girl's flames

192
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:02,041
are melting your mercury.

193
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:04,833
Wanna swap opponents, Silverboy?

194
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:06,125
I don't think so.

195
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:09,083
Those flames are hardly
enough to best me.

196
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:12,583
You have no idea what
I had to do to get where I am.

197
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:18,666
[JACK yells]

198
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,208
[yells]

199
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:45,958
[FINRAL yelps]
All this magic flying around--

200
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:48,208
it looks like some
kinda natural disaster.

201
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:50,458
I can't see through
all this dust.

202
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,041
Jeez, they're really
fightin' hard.

203
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:55,416
Better be careful, Jack.

204
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,666
You talk a good game,
but you cut it kinda close.

205
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,875
Looks like Charlotte's
doin' well, though.

206
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:03,458
And Nozel's bangs
haven't budged at all.

207
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:04,583
You can see?

208
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:08,083
Remember? Ki? I can sense 'em.

209
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,041
Yeah.

210
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,291
Finral. You ready?

211
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:12,541
[FINRAL]
For what, sir?

212
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:14,708
You've been restin' up
for a while now.

213
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:17,541
You oughta have enough
mana for a Spatial spell.

214
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:19,458
You mean we're leaving?
Sure, I'm ready!

215
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,375
Let the other captains
handle this, we can just--

216
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:23,833
[cackles]

217
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:28,416
[LICHT] The Magic Knight
captains are as powerful

218
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,708
as I expected them to be.

219
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:33,916
However, they are no match
for the Third Eye.

220
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,375
Our people are much loved
by the mana of this world.

221
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:42,041
And that is why there
must be some mistake.

222
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:44,333
How could an ordinary human,

223
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:48,166
one who's magicless,
clearly shunned by the mana,

224
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,041
possess that grimoire?

225
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:53,666
I must retrieve it from
his unworthy hands at once.

226
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,708
[YAMI] He's been weakened,
but I'm not gonna risk

227
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,666
letting him get away.

228
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:02,958
[LICHT] Ah, yes.
I expected this from you.

229
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,750
[FINRAL]
He's countering? Not good!

230
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:05,958
Look out, sir!

231
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:09,833
Oh, dear. You misjudged
our boss, I see.

232
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:12,541
[gasps]

233
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:13,958
I'll end you this time.

234
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,333
[VETTO yells]

235
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:16,833
Finish him, Licht.

236
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:19,166
[YAMI] You're goin' after
the boss, too, aren't ya?

237
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,500
All right. Bring it!

238
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,958
[ALL]
How did he get over there?

239
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:30,000
[NOZEL] It shouldn't have been
possible in all this confusion!

240
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,416
[YAMI] That's the kinda
thing you can do

241
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,625
when you learn to read ki.

242
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:36,333
[LICHT]
No one noticed. No one!

243
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:40,250
None of us could sense this boy,
because he has no magic!

244
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:42,583
We're gonna get you this time!

245
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:43,958
Thanks for trustin'
that I was gonna

246
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:46,625
take one last shot at you
while I had the chance.

247
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:51,416
As for me, I put my trust
in our magicless freak, here.

248
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:55,833
[ASTA]
My magic is never giving up!

249
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:57,208
[gasps]

250
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:58,791
[YAMI yells]

251
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,375
[ASTA grunts]

252
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:09,041
[ASTA pants]

253
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:10,500
[laughs] Gotcha.

254
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:14,666
So, what'd you think about
my magic-free smash attack?

255
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,458
You trying to take
all the credit, kid?

256
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:18,416
Sorry, Captain!

257
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,666
Not bad.

258
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,916
You really pushed past
your limits that time.

259
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,375
Thank you!

260
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:26,791
[gasps]

261
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:27,625
Where's Licht?

262
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:28,541
[BOTH]
Oh, no!

263
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,708
Eyes forward, beastie.

264
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:33,458
That little runt.

265
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:35,000
He left us in the dust.

266
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:38,458
[cackles] So much for
getting all the glory.

267
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:42,291
We're Magic Knight captains,
we can't fall behind!

268
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:44,625
It's up to us to take
care of the rest.

269
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:46,083
[FINRAL]
Captain Yami?

270
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:48,791
Wonder if any more of their
friends are gonna show up.

271
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:50,750
--I guess we'll see.
--[ASTA] That would be so cool!

272
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:52,375
Now's your chance
to finish him while

273
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:54,916
the other captains keep
the rest of them busy.

274
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,916
[YAMI grumbles]

275
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,791
[ASTA]
He's glowing.

276
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,666
[GAUCHE]
What the--?

277
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,041
No!

278
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:08,458
When that brat hit Licht
with his anti-magic attack,

279
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:12,166
it broke the spell of Sealing
that was cast on him.

280
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,791
That's not good.

281
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:17,666
That power had been set aside
for a day still to come.

282
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:24,875
This cannot be! Why do
you have that grimoire?

283
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,250
[LICHT]
Why do you wield them?

284
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:32,625
The demon-slayer sword and
the demon-dweller sword.

285
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:35,541
What's he saying?

286
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:39,166
[LICHT] Those swords
belong to the master!

287
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:42,208
[NOZEL]
The master?

288
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:44,708
According to our intel,
"the master" is the leader

289
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:47,625
of the Eye of the Midnight Sun.

290
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:51,250
Does this mean he
isn't the master?

291
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:52,916
You keep sayin' this crap.

292
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,291
Well, I'm sick of it.

293
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:57,666
It doesn't matter who this
"master" guy is, okay?

294
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,875
This grimoire and
these swords are mine.

295
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:02,041
I don't care if
they're all beat up!

296
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:05,000
Now quit with all
the accusations!

297
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:08,583
They're not yours.
Give them back.

298
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:12,541
That grimoire could
never belong to you.

299
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:17,750
The master's grimoire could
never be yours, filthy human.

300
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:20,708
Oh, boy!

301
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:22,208
What now, Captain?

302
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,500
Things aren't lookin'
so good, huh?

303
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:27,250
[cackles] Well,
this should be fun!

304
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,333
Death Scythe!

305
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:33,208
No way! It absorbed
my Severing Magic

306
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:34,416
like it was nothing.

307
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,500
That's an enormous mass
of pure magic power.

308
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:39,375
If he releases it,
we're all dead.

309
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:42,541
It'll destroy everything
in the surrounding area.

310
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:43,708
But what do we do?

311
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:46,291
Even we cannot stop this.

312
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,250
How much mana
is he channeling?

313
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:49,625
He's been holding back.

314
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:52,875
He could've obliterated us
anytime he wanted to.

315
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:58,083
[screams] I should have never
come on this stupid mission!

316
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,500
Actually, scratch that.

317
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,583
I should never have joined
this squad to begin with!

318
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:04,458
Stop runnin' your mouth.
Nobody wants to hear it.

319
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:07,083
Besides, this could
be our chance.

320
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,833
Just think of all the
limits we can push past.

321
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:12,041
We'll be up against
some real power!

322
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:14,125
[yells] Let's go!

323
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:15,375
[FINRAL]
No way!

324
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:18,083
Seriously, have you people
gone crazy here?!

325
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:19,250
[GAUCHE]
Hey!

326
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,208
Shut up and pull it
together, Finral!

327
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,541
I'm still your superior!

328
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,750
[GAUCHE] My magic's not
fully recovered yet.

329
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:28,666
Can I reflect his strike
with what I have?

330
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,375
That's too bad.

331
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,083
I'll need a raincheck
on that drink.

332
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:36,666
His body isn't going
to hold out much longer.

333
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,833
We need to hurry!

334
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:43,208
[VETTO, FANA, RHYA]
Trinity Sealing Magic!

335
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:52,000
[NOZEL]
They mean to seal away that?

336
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:53,875
All that magic...

337
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:00,500
Incredible.

338
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:02,375
You pushed yourself
just a little too hard

339
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:04,750
this time, Licht. We've got you.

340
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:05,958
Now get some rest.

341
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,458
It will be all right.

342
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:09,458
For now.

343
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,625
It's time to go, Valty.

344
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:21,500
Our boss is feeling
a bit under the weather.

345
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,625
So we're gonna have
to call it a day.

346
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:26,291
We may have lost to you
people this time around.

347
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:27,500
Just wait.

348
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:29,291
I promise, when we meet
again, I won't leave

349
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:31,375
until you've tasted
true despair.

350
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,000
We carnivores live to feast

351
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:35,000
on bottom-feeding
vermin like you.

352
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:37,750
The next time we meet,
you'll draw your last breath.

353
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:39,333
Remember, wherever you go,

354
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:42,541
the Eye of the
Midnight Sun is watching.

355
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:51,541
[CHARLOTTE]
That much magic power,

356
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:54,541
and they were able to seal
it with a single spell.

357
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:57,375
So, then, they were
toying with us.

358
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:58,791
[JACK]
The Third Eye.

359
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:01,458
Not only do they have a
tremendous amount of mana,

360
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:04,166
they are singularly
skilled at using it.

361
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,541
"Much loved by the mana"
is right. [cackles]

362
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:10,916
I'd like another chance
to rip them apart.

363
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,916
[NOZEL]
We let them get away.

364
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,750
But it won't happen again.

365
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:18,541
I will avenge you. I swear it

366
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,291
So, did we win?

367
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:21,875
It's less that we won,

368
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:24,416
and more like the
other guys ran off.

369
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,416
[YAMI] Huh. From where I'm
standing, them runnin' off

370
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,541
like that is as good as a win.

371
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:32,416
Besides, Beast Boy
said they lost.

372
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,750
Yeah!

373
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,041
Finral, Gauche.

374
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:40,333
You heard the captain! We won!

375
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:41,833
Yep! We totally did!

376
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:42,958
[GAUCHE]
You didn't do anything.

377
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:44,083
Dude, chill out.

378
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,083
We did it!

379
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,041
Yami, we're waiting.

380
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:50,333
Is there something you'd
like to say to us?

381
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:51,750
I'm hungry.

382
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:54,500
[cackles] I don't care
about your stomach.

383
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:56,541
I thought a "thank you"
might be in order.

384
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,166
What would you have done
if the other captains

385
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,250
and I hadn't shown up?

386
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:01,708
You can bet your
Scythe I wouldn't have

387
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:02,916
let 'em get away.

388
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,750
I would've taken 'em all down.

389
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:08,291
[cackles] You don't really think
that would've been possible?

390
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:10,041
You foolish man.

391
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:11,833
Fighting enemies
that strong alone

392
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:13,583
would be nothing
short of reckless.

393
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:16,291
Would it kill you to be
nice for once, woman?

394
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:17,833
[CHARLOTTE]
Still.

395
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:20,708
The idea that he would take
on all of them by himself...

396
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:24,083
I didn't fall in love
with him for nothing.

397
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:26,333
You should try to control
that tongue of yours.

398
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:28,333
Otherwise, you're
gonna die single.

399
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:30,000
[CHARLOTTE]
I told you, I don't care!

400
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:32,666
The battlefield is my husband!

401
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:35,375
Worry about finding your own
partner and leave me be!

[laughs] I'll make a deal
with you, Charlotte:

403
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,416
if we're both still single
when we're old and gray,

404
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,875
we can look after each other.

405
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:43,541
What? You're joking!

406
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:45,458
Who would want to be
with someone like you?

407
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:46,833
[CHARLOTTE]
Why can't I just be honest

408
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:48,875
and tell him how I really feel?

and then some.

of you this time, huh?

Well, you can rest a bit now.

And you're our
strongest members?

00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:30,833
What did you say?

00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:34,125
Uh... Just. What do we do next?

427
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:36,458
The Wizard King will get
a report about Licht.

428
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:39,583
And soon, he'll start
pushing even harder.

are still in custody.

431

If they talk, the Magic Knights
could find this place.

432
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:48,583
They could even discover
Licht's true identit--

saying about Captain Yami?

[gasps] Um. I wasn't
saying anything!

And don't call me "Captain,"
call me "Char."
