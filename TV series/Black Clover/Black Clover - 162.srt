1
00:00:22,512 --> 00:00:25,515
[NARRATOR] Within the clover's
fifth leaf, there lives a devil.

2
00:00:27,183 --> 00:00:29,686
[NARRATOR] Asta, born
unable to harness mana,

3
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:31,396
was granted the power
of Anti-magic

4
00:00:31,479 --> 00:00:33,231
from his five-leaf grimoire,

5
00:00:33,314 --> 00:00:36,693
giving him the ability
to nullify spells.

6
00:00:36,776 --> 00:00:39,320
Unfortunately, the members
of Spade Kingdom's

7
00:00:39,404 --> 00:00:41,990
Dark Triad also possess
powers from the devils

8
00:00:42,073 --> 00:00:44,242
of the underworld
and used them to launch

9
00:00:44,325 --> 00:00:47,120
an invasion on the
neighboring countries.

10
00:00:47,203 --> 00:00:49,164
Gaining strength from
his belief in himself

11
00:00:49,247 --> 00:00:51,249
and from the support
of his friends,

12
00:00:51,332 --> 00:00:54,836
Asta continues to fight for
the safety of this world.

13
00:01:00,091 --> 00:01:02,927
[NARRATOR] Zenon--one of
the Spade Kingdom's Dark Triad--

14
00:01:03,011 --> 00:01:04,679
attacked the Golden
Dawn headquarters

15
00:01:04,763 --> 00:01:07,557
with two of his underlings
from the Dark Disciples.

16
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,518
[YUNO] What the hell
do you think you're doing...

17
00:01:10,602 --> 00:01:13,021
...to my comrades?!

18
00:01:13,104 --> 00:01:16,066
[NARRATOR] Enraged at the sight
of his friends being harmed,

19
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:18,860
Yuno defeated
the two lesser foes.

20
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,448
[ZENON]
Fifty-five percent.

21
00:01:23,531 --> 00:01:26,618
Do you see what your problem is?

22
00:01:26,701 --> 00:01:28,787
It isn't that you're weak.

23
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:31,164
I'm just that much better.

24
00:01:34,668 --> 00:01:37,504
[NARRATOR] Just when Yuno's
death seemed all but certain,

25
00:01:37,587 --> 00:01:40,298
he was revived by
the Budding of Yggdrasil,

26
00:01:40,382 --> 00:01:43,218
the spell left behind
by Captain Vangeance.

27
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:45,804
[YUNO whimpers]

28
00:01:45,887 --> 00:01:50,809
[yells]

29
00:03:26,363 --> 00:03:29,407
Humanity is evil.

30
00:03:29,491 --> 00:03:30,784
Rage.

31
00:03:30,867 --> 00:03:32,660
Fear.

32
00:03:32,744 --> 00:03:34,371
Hatred.

33
00:03:34,454 --> 00:03:36,247
Revenge.

34
00:03:36,331 --> 00:03:39,167
Destruction.

35
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,837
Evil is a human's nature.

36
00:03:42,921 --> 00:03:47,592
And we have ceased to be
amused by this mundane world.

37
00:03:49,052 --> 00:03:50,887
[DANTE]
Now then.

38
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:53,682
I suppose I should be on my way.

39
00:03:54,974 --> 00:03:57,435
[DANTE]
What kind of human are you,

40
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,648
Arcane-stage mage,
Yami Sukehiro?

41
00:04:05,777 --> 00:04:07,862
[VANICA]
This rules!

42
00:04:07,946 --> 00:04:10,990
Huh. I wonder how
Loropechika and her pals

43
00:04:11,074 --> 00:04:12,534
have been doing lately.

44
00:04:12,617 --> 00:04:15,078
I hope they've got
lots of energy!

45
00:04:15,161 --> 00:04:17,497
Then they'll be
extra fun to crush!

46
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:18,707
[giggles]

47
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,166
[slurps]

48
00:04:22,085 --> 00:04:24,004
[CHARMY]
It's so yummy!

49
00:04:24,087 --> 00:04:26,965
The Heart Kingdom's got all
kinds of delicious delicacies!

50
00:04:27,048 --> 00:04:30,427
Oh, Charmy!
You're so adorable!

51
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,886
[MIMOSA]
My goodness.

52
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:34,681
Those two really do make
the perfect pair, don't they?

53
00:04:34,764 --> 00:04:36,474
Cut it out, Loropechika.

54
00:04:36,558 --> 00:04:39,269
She'll never stop eating if you
keep spoiling her like that.

55
00:04:39,352 --> 00:04:41,187
Look, she's about to pop!

56
00:04:41,271 --> 00:04:42,731
It's no problem.

57
00:04:42,814 --> 00:04:45,525
Charmy'll be super precious
no matter how chubby she gets!

58
00:04:45,608 --> 00:04:47,027
I couldn't agree more,

59
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:50,822
because a well-fed Charmy
is a happy Charmy, after all!

60
00:04:50,905 --> 00:04:53,825
Did she seriously only come to
the Heart Kingdom to find out

61
00:04:53,908 --> 00:04:55,869
what kind of snacks
they had to offer?

62
00:04:55,952 --> 00:04:58,913
Seems that way.
We need to focus.

63
00:04:58,997 --> 00:05:03,001
As it stands, we'll be fighting
the Spade Kingdom any day now.

64
00:05:03,084 --> 00:05:05,754
Fine by me. I'm ready
to throw down whenever!

65
00:05:05,837 --> 00:05:09,174
So am I! And we've taken over
all of the towns surrounding

66
00:05:09,257 --> 00:05:10,842
the Spade Kingdom's border,

67
00:05:10,925 --> 00:05:13,094
so that should give us
a decent advantage.

68
00:05:13,178 --> 00:05:16,348
That's true, but we can't
afford to get comfortable,

69
00:05:16,431 --> 00:05:18,099
which is why Rill and
Charlotte have made a trip

70
00:05:18,183 --> 00:05:19,893
back to the Clover Kingdom
to participate in

71
00:05:19,976 --> 00:05:21,978
a squad captains' meeting.

72
00:05:22,062 --> 00:05:26,149
I know, but I've got all this
anticipation welling up inside,

73
00:05:26,232 --> 00:05:28,068
so it's hard to contain it!

74
00:05:28,151 --> 00:05:29,736
Then come spar with me!

75
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:32,614
Heh. Since I haven't gotten
a chance to fight against you

76
00:05:32,697 --> 00:05:34,699
for real yet!

77
00:05:34,783 --> 00:05:36,368
Yeah, that's a great idea!

78
00:05:36,451 --> 00:05:38,078
Let's see if Asta
wants to join us, too,

79
00:05:38,161 --> 00:05:40,955
and then we can make it
a three-way battle royale!

80
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,248
[NOELLE]
Asta's not here, though.

81
00:05:42,332 --> 00:05:43,583
What?!

82
00:05:43,667 --> 00:05:45,627
[NOELLE] Since we had
a break from our training,

83
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:48,421
he wanted to take
a few gifts back.

84
00:05:48,505 --> 00:05:50,215
He and Finral
went there together.

85
00:05:50,298 --> 00:05:52,342
[LEOPOLD groans]

86
00:05:52,425 --> 00:05:55,470
The battle is sure to be brutal,
so it's smart to relax

87
00:05:55,553 --> 00:05:57,222
while we still have the chance.

88
00:05:57,305 --> 00:06:00,141
Perhaps everyone should
have something to eat.

89
00:06:03,895 --> 00:06:05,730
[CHARMY]
Sorry, I've officially claimed

90
00:06:05,814 --> 00:06:08,650
this pile of noms for myself.

91
00:06:08,733 --> 00:06:11,486
On second thought, you'll have
to locate food elsewhere.

92
00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:14,572
I didn't realize it,
but every single morsel of this

93
00:06:14,656 --> 00:06:16,074
belongs to Charmy.

94
00:06:16,157 --> 00:06:18,410
[NOELLE] That's why I said
not to spoil her!

95
00:06:18,493 --> 00:06:20,328
[LOROPECHIKA giggles]

96
00:06:21,663 --> 00:06:23,748
[LOROPECHIKA gasps]
Are you ready, Undine?

97
00:06:23,832 --> 00:06:25,250
Of course.

98
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:27,585
[NOELLE]
What's wrong, Loropechika?

99
00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:29,546
[LOROPECHIKA]
Spade is here.

100
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:30,922
It looks like...

101
00:06:31,006 --> 00:06:34,259
...six of them, spread
throughout the kingdom!

102
00:06:34,342 --> 00:06:36,094
[LEOPOLD]
That was quick!

103
00:06:36,177 --> 00:06:38,596
What about the
Mana Zone barrier?

104
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,016
They tore right through it?

105
00:06:41,099 --> 00:06:43,184
[LOROPECHIKA] Since Undine's
clones are spread out,

106
00:06:43,268 --> 00:06:45,812
we were quickly able to notify
the Spirit Guardians

107
00:06:45,895 --> 00:06:47,355
of their locations.

108
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:49,941
[UNDINE] And they've
taken defensive measures.

109
00:06:50,025 --> 00:06:51,192
[LOROPECHIKA]
Even so,

110
00:06:51,276 --> 00:06:54,070
all six of these enemies
are stage-zero mages

111
00:06:54,154 --> 00:06:57,198
who possess a devil's power.

112
00:06:57,282 --> 00:07:00,493
This could prove difficult even
for the Spirit Guardians.

113
00:07:00,577 --> 00:07:04,039
I may ask for your help
if things get too dire!

114
00:07:04,122 --> 00:07:05,707
Loropechika!

115
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:09,169
[LOROPECHIKA gasps]
This intense magic...

116
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:14,299
[LOROPECHIKA]
It's Vanica of the Dark Triad.

117
00:07:14,382 --> 00:07:17,927
She's possessed by
the devil Megicula!

118
00:07:18,011 --> 00:07:21,765
[NOELLE growls]
Megicula...

119
00:07:26,019 --> 00:07:28,563
[VANICA]
Heh. Great!

120
00:07:28,646 --> 00:07:30,190
From the looks of it,
I'd say we've killed

121
00:07:30,273 --> 00:07:32,525
about 100 of them so far!

122
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:36,154
Lady Vanica, don't you
think we should head--

123
00:07:36,237 --> 00:07:37,322
[groans]

124
00:07:37,405 --> 00:07:38,698
[VANICA]
Not yet!

125
00:07:38,782 --> 00:07:41,701
The more of Loropechika's
peasants we mow down,

126
00:07:41,785 --> 00:07:44,662
the more fired up
she's bound to get.

127
00:07:44,746 --> 00:07:46,831
That'll make this way more fun!

128
00:07:46,915 --> 00:07:49,417
Yes, of course, milady. As you--

129
00:07:49,501 --> 00:07:50,669
[groans]

130
00:07:50,752 --> 00:07:54,964
[chuckles] Oh, yeah!
Step on me more!

131
00:07:55,048 --> 00:07:56,216
[chuckles]

132
00:07:56,299 --> 00:07:57,884
You pig.

133
00:08:01,721 --> 00:08:03,807
[NARRATOR] The neutral zone
between the Clover

134
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:05,684
and Spade Kingdoms.

135
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:09,646
[NARRATOR] The Black Bulls'
hideout was placed here

136
00:08:09,729 --> 00:08:12,357
to serve as a first
line of defense.

137
00:08:13,566 --> 00:08:15,527
Hey, we're back from
the Heart Kingdom!

138
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:17,987
And we brought gifts!

139
00:08:18,071 --> 00:08:20,865
You thought of us after
being away for so long?

140
00:08:20,949 --> 00:08:22,951
Well, aren't you a sweetie?

141
00:08:23,034 --> 00:08:24,202
Good thing, too.

142
00:08:24,285 --> 00:08:27,247
'Cause we're completely
out of drinking snacks.

143
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:30,917
[GREY] Um, hey...
Nice to see you, Asta!

144
00:08:31,001 --> 00:08:34,004
I sure wish I had a little
more Marie around here.

145
00:08:34,087 --> 00:08:36,881
[ASTA] Yeah, I can't really
help you with that, Gauche.

146
00:08:36,965 --> 00:08:40,885
Uh. The captain's meeting
should be over with soon.

147
00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:43,263
Guess I better go pick up Yami.

148
00:08:43,346 --> 00:08:45,765
You're busy, huh, Finral?

149
00:08:45,849 --> 00:08:48,143
We really appreciate
everything you do, though.

150
00:08:48,226 --> 00:08:51,438
[sighs] Yeah,
this job's exhausting.

151
00:08:51,521 --> 00:08:53,023
I'll be gone for a while.

152
00:08:53,106 --> 00:08:55,775
It's a long trip, so I'm
gonna make a bunch of stops.

153
00:08:55,859 --> 00:08:57,068
Roger that!

154
00:08:57,152 --> 00:08:58,862
[FINRAL]
See you later.

155
00:08:58,945 --> 00:09:00,363
Hey, how's Gordon doing?

156
00:09:00,447 --> 00:09:02,532
I bet he's been studying
his Curse Magic like crazy,

157
00:09:02,615 --> 00:09:03,575
hasn't he?

158
00:09:03,658 --> 00:09:06,161
[sighs] Don't ask me.

159
00:09:06,244 --> 00:09:07,912
All I know about it is...

160
00:09:07,996 --> 00:09:09,831
...I'm not going back there.

161
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:18,590
[GORDON]
This is hard.

162
00:09:18,673 --> 00:09:20,508
[NATHAN]
You can do it, son.

163
00:09:20,592 --> 00:09:22,802
[ROXANNE]
I believe in you.

164
00:09:28,058 --> 00:09:29,851
Gordon. You really should eat.

165
00:09:29,934 --> 00:09:31,561
That sandwich!

166
00:09:31,644 --> 00:09:33,897
It's exactly the same as
the one you made for me

167
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,358
when we had our first date!

168
00:09:39,569 --> 00:09:43,031
[NATHAN] Takes me back
to the good old days.

169
00:09:43,114 --> 00:09:46,785
[JONNA] Yes, when you
were 18 and I was 17.

170
00:09:46,868 --> 00:09:49,120
Our meeting was pure fate!

171
00:09:52,874 --> 00:09:56,336
Papa, please tell me more about
how you and Mama first met.

172
00:09:56,419 --> 00:09:57,962
[NATHAN]
With pleasure!

173
00:09:58,046 --> 00:10:00,674
I'd rather just focus
on my studies.

174
00:10:00,757 --> 00:10:04,469
[shrieks]

175
00:10:04,552 --> 00:10:07,430
So, I guess Henry
is still resting up?

176
00:10:07,514 --> 00:10:09,766
[VANESSA] Apparently,
his mana supply is low,

177
00:10:09,849 --> 00:10:11,726
since so many of us have
been away from the hideout

178
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:14,020
because of training and such.

179
00:10:14,104 --> 00:10:16,231
And with Charmy gone,
we don't have access

180
00:10:16,314 --> 00:10:19,150
to that mana-recovery
food she makes.

181
00:10:19,234 --> 00:10:21,486
Yeah, Charmy's hooked on
the snacks in the Heart Kingdom,

182
00:10:21,569 --> 00:10:23,863
so she probably won't
be back for a while.

183
00:10:23,947 --> 00:10:27,242
Nothing motivates her
more than food, after all.

184
00:10:27,325 --> 00:10:29,035
Oh, by the way, where's Magna?

185
00:10:29,119 --> 00:10:30,995
Right, I forgot to mention.

186
00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:34,249
No sooner than he got back from
his trip to the Heart Kingdom,

187
00:10:34,332 --> 00:10:37,335
he and Zora headed off
somewhere else together.

188
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:40,964
I guess they get along, since
they're both Grumpy-Guses.

189
00:10:41,047 --> 00:10:43,425
[gasps] Hey... guys!

190
00:10:43,508 --> 00:10:44,801
Is Henry awake?

191
00:10:44,884 --> 00:10:46,594
I guess so.

192
00:10:46,678 --> 00:10:48,054
Is something wrong?

193
00:10:48,138 --> 00:10:52,017
[gasps] The hideout!
It's floating!

194
00:10:53,435 --> 00:10:57,188
[DANTE]
So. Yami isn't home right now.

195
00:10:57,272 --> 00:10:59,774
In that case,
perhaps you can entertain me

196
00:10:59,858 --> 00:11:01,526
while I wait for him.

197
00:11:01,609 --> 00:11:03,111
Shall we?

198
00:11:03,194 --> 00:11:04,738
Spade's attacking us here?

199
00:11:04,821 --> 00:11:06,656
He's the one who's
making us float?

200
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,491
By himself?

201
00:11:08,575 --> 00:11:09,993

Oh?

00:11:14,456 --> 00:11:18,251
Here... we... go...!

205
00:11:20,295 --> 00:11:23,298
[HENRY] Recombination Magic:
The Raging Black Bull.

206
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:28,386
If he wants a battle,
then that's what I'll give him!

00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:31,097
Large Reflect Refrain!

Insolence.

Gravity Magic:
Presence of the Demon King.

211
00:11:45,153 --> 00:11:47,489
What the hell
kind of magic is that?

212
00:11:47,572 --> 00:11:50,075
Half of the forest
is snapping like twigs!

213
00:11:50,158 --> 00:11:53,703
And if it weren't for Rouge,
then that would be us right now.

214
00:11:54,621 --> 00:11:57,082
[DANTE]
Despite being hit by my spell,

215
00:11:57,165 --> 00:11:58,958
you're still in one piece.

216
00:11:59,042 --> 00:12:00,752
[chuckles]

217
00:12:00,835 --> 00:12:02,629
I'm guessing
one of you has magic

218
00:12:02,712 --> 00:12:05,590
that influences natural laws.

219
00:12:05,674 --> 00:12:10,512
I thought Yami was
the only arcane-stage here.

220
00:12:10,595 --> 00:12:11,763
Excellent.

221

[VANESSA gasps]

Heh. Hm?

00:12:16,976 --> 00:12:19,646
Your fight is with me!

224
00:12:19,729 --> 00:12:22,691
My, aren't you
a lively little nuisance?

225
00:12:22,774 --> 00:12:26,152
Fair enough, then.
I can spare you some attention.

226

[gasps]

231
00:12:46,673 --> 00:12:49,259
He canceled out my magic,
then made his move.

232
00:12:49,342 --> 00:12:52,721
Not half bad.
But I'm not done.

233

That magic may
modify natural laws,

but I didn't realize it could
overturn death, as well.

[VANESSA]
His magic's overwhelming.

247
00:13:30,842 --> 00:13:33,595
And it's got
such a wide range, too!

248
00:13:33,678 --> 00:13:35,972
Hah.

249
00:13:36,056 --> 00:13:38,850
Not only can you manipulate
the laws of nature,

250
00:13:38,933 --> 00:13:42,062
you're also
strikingly beautiful.

251
00:13:42,145 --> 00:13:46,024
Dante of the Dark Triad.
The pleasure is all mine.

252
00:13:46,107 --> 00:13:49,986
[VANESSA] The Dark Triad?
Like, the ones from Spade?

253
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:51,654
[GAUCHE] Those jerks are
the reason our kingdom

254

got wrapped up in this mess!

Now, come.

You're going to be my woman.

00:13:58,244 --> 00:13:59,579
Ugh.

258
00:13:59,662 --> 00:14:02,749
You can't just take possession
of someone like that!

259
00:14:02,832 --> 00:14:05,502
I would love to see you
try to stop me.

260
00:14:05,585 --> 00:14:08,254
So you're the guy
who's in charge, huh?!

261
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:12,425
What a delicious surprise.

262
00:14:12,509 --> 00:14:16,054
I didn't know Clover had
a devil-possessed, as well.

I can't hit him!

267
00:14:32,737 --> 00:14:36,157
That Anti-magic technique
is made to track mana.

268
00:14:36,241 --> 00:14:37,992
So how did he dodge it?

269
00:14:39,285 --> 00:14:41,454
And what do we do?

If he can side-step that,

272
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:48,128
then we'll keep attacking
until he screws up!

273
00:14:48,211 --> 00:14:51,172
How nice of him to come
straight to our doorstep.

274
00:14:51,256 --> 00:14:52,924
If we can win this fight,

[DANTE] I'd like us
to have a discussion.

True, we may have
different ranks,

but we're both devil-possessed.

293

You're doing such terrible
things to your own people.

How could I ever
get along with you?

[chuckles] I don't understand
all your melodramatic nonsense,

but if I disgust you, then
that's quite the compliment.

300
00:16:12,212 --> 00:16:14,589
So thanks for that.

301
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:17,884
Malice is an emotion that's
unique to human beings.

302
00:16:17,967 --> 00:16:20,804
It distinguishes us
from all other animals.

303

[ASTA grunts]

304
00:16:22,222 --> 00:16:25,433
But what am I saying?
I'm sure you're familiar.

305
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:26,518
Rage.

306
00:16:26,601 --> 00:16:27,602
Hatred.

307
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:28,853
Revenge.

Destruction.

309
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:32,732
Malice has power!

310
00:16:32,816 --> 00:16:37,028
Because, whenever you let those
feelings of malice take over,

311
00:16:37,112 --> 00:16:40,240
that's when you're
at your most human.

312
00:16:40,323 --> 00:16:46,287
After all, humanity's
truest form is evil!

[ASTA]
You're wrong!

314
00:16:47,956 --> 00:16:52,085
I'll admit, I have bad thoughts
every once in a while, too.

315

Sometimes, they even
give me more power to fight!

316
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:58,883
Thing is, I have a heart
that's really strong,

317
00:16:58,967 --> 00:17:00,802
so I can control those
feelings and use them

to do good things instead!

319
00:17:03,013 --> 00:17:05,765
That's what makes me human!

320
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:07,267
Is that so?

321
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:09,269
It seems that you're quite
unique among those

322
00:17:09,352 --> 00:17:12,522
who are possessed by devils.

323
00:17:12,605 --> 00:17:14,941
Meow.

324
00:17:15,025 --> 00:17:20,113
As long as I'm here, I won't
let any of my friends die!

325
00:17:20,196 --> 00:17:22,198
[DANTE]
Naughty girl.

326
00:17:22,282 --> 00:17:24,993
You're my woman now, remember?

327
00:17:25,076 --> 00:17:26,953
And that means you
can't use your power

328
00:17:27,037 --> 00:17:30,415
to help anyone except for me.

329
00:17:30,498 --> 00:17:32,083
[growls]

330
00:17:32,167 --> 00:17:34,794
Let's move to 60%.

00:17:35,962 --> 00:17:37,922
[ROUGE meows]

332
00:17:38,006 --> 00:17:40,342
[grunts] This is awful.

333
00:17:40,425 --> 00:17:42,469
I worked so hard to improve...

334
00:17:42,552 --> 00:17:44,429
To become stronger...

335
00:17:44,512 --> 00:17:47,724
And he just undid everything
in the blink of an eye!

336

[panting]

337
00:17:51,144 --> 00:17:52,854
[HENRY]
My mana's depleted.

338
00:17:52,937 --> 00:17:56,649
I can't... operate
the Black Bull anymore.

339
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:06,868
[GAUCHE]
I can't control my body!

340
00:18:06,951 --> 00:18:10,789
This guy's got us pinned down!
We're sitting ducks!

341
00:18:10,872 --> 00:18:13,333
[GREY]
I have to do something!

342
00:18:16,503 --> 00:18:21,716
[DANTE] Gravity Magic:
Evil God's Pressure Craft.

343
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,551
Have it your way.

344
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:25,470
[gasps]

345
00:18:25,553 --> 00:18:29,557
Perhaps you'll be more driven...
if I appeal to your feelings.

346
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:31,059
No, wait.

347
00:18:32,686 --> 00:18:34,270
Stop it, now!

348
00:18:36,022 --> 00:18:37,565
[ASTA]
Stop!

349
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:38,775
[DANTE chuckles]

350
00:18:38,858 --> 00:18:42,070
Don't do it!

351
00:18:48,076 --> 00:18:49,994
--[VANESSA] Oh, no!
--[GREY] He hurt Gauche!

352
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:59,713
[ASTA'S MOM] I'm here with you,
my precious little boy.

353
00:19:04,092 --> 00:19:06,344
[ASTA snarls]

354
00:19:06,428 --> 00:19:09,556

00:19:11,391 --> 00:19:13,727
[DANTE]
There it is.

357
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:16,521
That's human nature!

358
00:19:16,604 --> 00:19:18,064
[GROUP gasps]

359
00:19:18,148 --> 00:19:20,608
[VANESSA] Asta's attack was
able to erase this guy's magic

360
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:23,194
from the whole area!

361
00:19:23,278 --> 00:19:25,155
[GREY whimpers]

362
00:19:31,161 --> 00:19:34,497
Now, then. Let's find out
what you can really do.

363
00:19:34,581 --> 00:19:36,666
[ASTA snarls]

[ASTA growls]

365
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:45,508
You'll never damage me
with those techniques.

366
00:19:45,592 --> 00:19:47,635
You'll have to
adjust your strategy.

367
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:48,845
[ASTA growling]

368
00:19:48,928 --> 00:19:51,222
[DANTE] I was hoping
to chat with you a bit,

369
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:55,685
but you appear to be lost inside
yourself at the moment.

370
00:19:55,769 --> 00:19:59,397
Perhaps you can
tell me who that devil is...

371
00:19:59,481 --> 00:20:01,524
...Lucifero.

372
00:20:01,608 --> 00:20:03,610
I do not know.

373
00:20:03,693 --> 00:20:06,529
If any high-ranking devils
are in the mortal realm now,

374
00:20:06,613 --> 00:20:10,492
it would probably be Zagred,
who left the underworld,

375
00:20:10,575 --> 00:20:13,745
but I don't believe
that's the case.

376
00:20:13,828 --> 00:20:16,956
Erasing magic is a parlor trick.

377
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,250
It must be the work of
a being that possesses

378
00:20:19,334 --> 00:20:21,419
only a paltry amount of mana.

379
00:20:21,503 --> 00:20:25,757
[DANTE] In other words,
the boy is no match for us.

380
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,427
We are possessed
by the mightiest of devils.

381
00:20:29,511 --> 00:20:32,681
That's what makes us
the Dark Triad!

What's going on here?

00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:00,917
Something's off.

388
00:21:01,001 --> 00:21:04,671
It's like Asta's powers
are going berserk!

389
00:21:04,754 --> 00:21:08,049
Still, we have to rely on him.

390
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:13,054
At this rate, Gauche won't
survive much longer.

391
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:16,474
If only Nero were here
to seal his wounds!

392
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:19,644
But even that
might not be enough.

393
00:21:19,728 --> 00:21:21,646
Hang in there, Gauche.

394
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:23,440
Please don't leave us!

My Transformation Magic...

400
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,161
It doesn't help at all...

401
00:21:36,244 --> 00:21:38,329
It's useless!

I'm impressed that you can still

404
00:21:43,084 --> 00:21:45,003
fight that hard.

405
00:21:45,086 --> 00:21:47,714
But I suppose I'll end this now.

Not giving up?

It seems you've
left a small scratch.

You'll regret that.
