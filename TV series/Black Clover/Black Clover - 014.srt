[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:14,958 --> 00:00:17,916
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:24,500
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:27,166
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:35,666
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,916
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,208
[NARRATOR] In this world,
magic is everything.

8
00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:49,875
[NARRATOR] Asta and Yuno
were abandoned together

9
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:53,333
as infants at a church in
the remote village of Hage.

10
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:56,166
Determined not to be held back
by their status as commoners,

11
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,541
both do their utmost to
realize their shared dream

12
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:02,000
of becoming the ultimate mage:
the Wizard King.

[NARRATOR]
In their 15th year,

14
00:01:04,458 --> 00:01:06,583
the two boys receive
their grimoires:

15
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:09,125
special books that will
enhance their magic.

16
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:12,041
They then set off to take
the Magic Knights Entrance Exam

17
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:15,875
in hopes of joining one of
the Wizard King's famed squads.

18
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:18,458
[ASTA, YUNO] We'll fight to see
who will be the Wizard King.

Whatever it takes.

20
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:23,958
[NARRATOR] After an exceptional
performance on the exam,

21
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:26,750
magically-gifted Yuno has
his pick of the nine squads

22
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:29,250
and elects to join
the elite Golden Dawn.

23
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:31,416
Meanwhile, magicless
Asta is inducted

24
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,958
into the Black Bulls, widely
regarded as a squad of misfits.

25
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:37,333
[ASTA]
I won't give up!

26
00:01:37,416 --> 00:01:39,791
I will become the Wizard King!

00:01:43,958 --> 00:01:45,791
[NARRATOR]
And so, the two young men

28

have taken the first step
toward achieving their dream

29

What's going on?
Is this an earthquake?

What the hell is that?!

Sorry to interrupt,
but there's urgent news, sir.

[JULIUS] We have a
situation on our hands.

37
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,416
Yes?

38
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,125
Calm down, Marx.

39
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:52,458
The timing couldn't
be more perfect.

40
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:55,208
I know just who to
give this mission to.

Please? You know you wanna.

Let's go! I'll eat your
flan again if I have to.

away from my food!

Okay! So, you'll fight?

How about Sylvantus Schnauzer?

00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:58,875
Yeah, maybe a different
name would be better.

00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:01,000
Something like... "Wine"!

00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,916
That's it. This fits
him perfectly.

[GAUCHE] This is my
angelic sister, Marie.

00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:13,208
You may use one
syllable of her name.

62
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:16,833
Thus, I dub you, "Ma." 

63

The birdie's tough.

He needs a cooler
name than that.

Lemme think for a sec.

66

Huh.

That's lame.

[mumbling] We're
naming the bird?

What a fun group
bonding activity.

I've got an idea if
anyone wants to hear it.

I think it's really good.

Mind if I fatten the bird up?

This guy's Birdyboy.

No. His name is
Sylvantus Schnauzer!

No, it's Birdyboy!

Dungeons one-oh-one.

Dungeons are like
tombs where people

from way back stored their
most valuable stuff.

They kinda try to kill you.

The folks who built 'em added
all sorts of crazy trap spells

to keep people from getting
to their stuff and misusing it.

And then Captain Yami

00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:36,000
Ooh! Ooh! Send me!

162
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,875
Please send me,
Captain Yami, sir!

163
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:39,000
Maybe I'll be able to learn

164
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:41,000
how to use the
most powerful magic!

165
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:43,875
Yeah? How ya gonna do
that without any magic?

166
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:47,583
It could work!
I won't know until I try.

167
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:51,000
Magic power or not, you are
goin' on this mission, kid.

168
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:53,250
Wasn't my call this time,
so don't look at me.

169
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,166
The Wizard King asked for you.

170
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,416
Wha--

171
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:01,041
What?! The Wizard King?
There's no way!

172
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,625
Hey, that's awesome,
Asta. Good for you.

173
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:04,958
So, what's the deal?

174
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:07,083
You got an in with the
Wizard King or somethin'?

175
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:08,791
No, not at all!

176
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,041
The Wizard King
actually chose me!

177
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:14,625
I don't know why, but...

178
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:18,041
Oh, wow! Wizard King, sir!

179
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,500
I've got this. Count on me.

180
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:24,291
I will devote myself to
this mission, body and soul!

181
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,791
Well, that's one.
Noelle, you should go, too.

182
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,041
[NOELLE]
Uh--

183
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:30,166
It's all about gettin'
experience, isn't it?

184
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,791
And last but not least is Luck.

185
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:35,041
I want you to take
the lead on this one.

186
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:36,666
The newbies are all yours.

187
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:37,833
--[MAGNA] Uh--
--[LUCK] Really? Me?

188
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:39,500
Sure. You're gonna
lose your edge

189
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,708
if you're always here
holdin' down the fort.

190
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:43,083
Thank you, sir!

191
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,208
And listen, Luck.

192
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:46,125
The rookies are
your responsibility,

193
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:47,958
so look after 'em.

194
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:49,458
Yeah, don't worry.

195
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:52,583
[mumbling] I want to go, too.

196
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,833
It makes me sad
to be left behind.

197
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:56,791
[GREY exhales]

198
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:01,875
Be careful out there.

199
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:04,416
Do your best, you two.
Go give 'em hell.

200
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,208
Yes, sir!

201
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:07,083
I suppose we can do that.

202
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:08,958
I wonder how many
ladies I can pick up

203
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,083
while you three are
exploring the dungeon.

204
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:12,500
--[ASTA] Hm?
--[NOELLE] Huh?

205
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:15,166
[GAUCHE] Since I'm not needed,
may I visit my sister?

206
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,791
If you're lookin' to get
killed, then go right ahead.

207
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:19,291
[FINRAL, GAUCHE]
Uh...

208
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,250
We're here.

209
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,000
The sunset looks
lovely from this hill.

210
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:31,083
I highly recommend this spot
for date nights, by the way.

211
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,625
I'll have some
nummies ready for you

212
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:34,500
when you get back.

213
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:36,458
[YAMI]
Okay, get it done, you three.

214
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:37,333
[ASTA]
Thanks!

215
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:38,958
[LUCK]
Bye!

216
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,458
[LUCK]
Well, let's go. This way!

217
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,958
[NOELLE]
Couldn't he have just taken us

218
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:51,833
right to the entrance
of the dungeon?

219
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:53,875
[LUCK laughs]
Nope, sorry.

220
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:57,166
Finral can only send people
places he's already been.

221
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:02,500
Whoa! It looks like he
dropped us off pretty close.

222
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:03,791
[ASTA, NOELLE gasp]

223
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:19,500
[ASTA, NOELLE gulp]

224
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:21,750
Right, let's do this.

225
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:25,000
[ASTA] Who asked you
to tag along, anyway?

226
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:26,750
[VANESSA yawns]

227
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:29,083
I still don't understand
how the Wizard King

228
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:31,375
even knows about Asta.

229
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,916
And you probably never will.

230
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:41,041
[YAMI] Fact is, the Wizard King
sees things we don't.

231
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:42,791
Also, he's weird.

232
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:47,416
[laughs]

233
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,916
It's so dark in here.

234
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,958
Could ya maybe stop
clinging like that?

235
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:52,541
I can barely walk over here.

236
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:55,583
Excuse me? I do not cling!

237
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:56,708
[ASTA]
Whoa!

238
00:11:58,375 --> 00:11:59,416
[NOELLE shrieks]

239
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,583
[ASTA]
I can't see anything!

240
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,708
[LUCK laughs]

241
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,125
Ow, ow, ow!

242
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:08,791
Thank you. I love
having my foot stomped.

243
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:11,625
What do you want from me?
It's pitch black here.

244
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:13,291
Calm down, would ya?

245
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:14,583
Well, maybe I would be calmer

246
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:16,416
if you hadn't broken
our only lantern!

247
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,958
You klutz!

248
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:20,750
[ASTA] I only broke it 'cause
you tripped and ran into me!

249
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:23,083
[NOELLE]
I am royalty. Royals don't trip.

250
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:24,125
[ASTA]
Clearly, they do.

251
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:26,250
[NOELLE]
Insect.

252
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,458
Is this it? Let's see.

253
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:30,083
Whoa, that's bright!

254
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:39,166
[gasps]

255
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,625
[BOTH gasp]

256
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:19,916
Whoa! This is, like, the
most awesome place ever!

257
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,791
It's all sparkly. So cool!

258
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,041
What's going on in here?

259
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:27,666
It looks like the
space has been warped

260
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,458
because of all the magic.

261
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:32,583
There's way more than
I detected outside.

262
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:34,666
The air is crazy thick.

263
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,208
[NOELLE]
Yes.

264
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:39,791
I don't think I've ever been
somewhere so steeped in mana.

265
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,750
[ASTA]
How can you tell?

266
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:43,000
Wait, you're standing in a room

267
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:45,250
full of this much mana,
and you can't feel it?

268
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:46,666
Nope, nothing.

269
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,750
Well, I suppose that
does make sense.

270
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,916
Amazing how different
people without magic are.

271
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,666
You don't have to rub it in!

272
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,208
It's not fair!

273
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:57,041
I wanna be able
to feel mana, too.

274
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:59,333
No! I want my own mana.

275
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:01,291
Do you know how lucky
you royals are?

276
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:04,416
You all seem to have
boatloads of it.

277
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,416
The source of all magic power,
and I don't have a single drop!

278
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,583
I'm empty! Just a hollow shell!

279
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:15,083
[sobs] Why? Why me? Huh?

280
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:17,750
What's that?

281
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,583
[ASTA screams]

282
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:22,083
Whoa! Is that trap magic?

283
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:26,375
[ASTA yels]

284
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,791
Whew.

285
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:33,041
Uh... Try to be more careful.

286
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,541
You almost got us all killed.

287
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,416
Heh. My bad. Sorry.

288
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,666
[LUCK]
Huh?

289
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:41,458
Hey, take a look at this,
Asta. Right there.

290
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:43,541
I don't see anything.

291
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:44,291
[LUCK]
Closer.

292
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:46,583
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

293
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:49,791
[yelps]

294
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,625
What'd you do that for?

295
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:56,875
That was so much fun to watch!

296
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,583
What are you playing at?

297
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:00,250
Oh! Another one.

298
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,500
[LUCK chuckles]

299
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,625
[NOELLE screams]

300
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:10,916
[ASTA yells]

301
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:15,041
[LUCK]
Heads up!

302
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:17,208
[yelps]

303
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,875
[ASTA yells]

304
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:20,291
[LUCK]
Comin' in!

305
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:21,958
[screams]

306
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:23,791
[ASTA grunts]

307
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:27,541
Wow, you guys should see
the looks on your faces!

308
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,416
That was fun, huh?

309
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,750
I could play in
this place all day!

310
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,250
[BOTH panting]

311
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:36,166
[ASTA, NOELLE] This guy is
totally going to get us killed.

312
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,166
Dungeons are no joke.

313
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,416
I wonder how those
two are doing.

314
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,583
They know they're
out on a mission

315
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:43,583
that's both important
and dangerous.

316
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:46,625
It'll give 'em a chance to
push their limits and grow.

317
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:47,541
Probably.

318
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,458
"Probably"?

319
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:50,833
Aw, don't worry about it.

320
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,250
They're gonna be fine.
Luck's with 'em.

321
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:55,125
Ain't no one out there
who can sense mana

322
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:59,125
better than him, and that
includes the royals.

323
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,000
All the squads would've
been after him,

324
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:03,500
if not for that defective
personality of his.

325
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,750
[laughs]

326
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,333
[MAGNA]
It's his busted personality

327
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:08,875
that's got me worried.

328
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,833
[VANESSA]
I'll drink to that.

329
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:13,916
Oh, man.

330
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,666
Your anti-magic sword is
seriously something else, Asta.

331
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:21,333
Maybe that's why the Wizard King
specifically asked for you.

332
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:22,833
I'm lookin' forward
to taking you on

333
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:24,333
in a couple years.

334
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,541
All you have to do is make
sure that sword of yours

335
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:28,958
is at the ready, and we
should have it made.

336
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:30,916
This dungeon'll be
a piece of cake.

337
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,791
Right!

338
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:35,041
Now, let's see what we've got.

339
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:38,916
[LUCK]
I'm just about at my limit.

340
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:57,416
[LUCK] I knew it.
We're not alone in here.

341
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,083
And the strongest
of them all is...

342
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:04,958
[LUCK]
Lightning Creation Magic...

343
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:09,333
[LUCK]
...Holy Lightning Boots!

344
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:12,750
Sorry guys, but something
important's come up.

345
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:13,750
I gotta get going.

346
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,083
[BOTH]
Huh?

347
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:16,375
You two just go ahead and
get through the dungeon

348
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:19,125
on your own, and I'll
see ya soon, okay?

349
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:20,541
[NOELLE]
Hey! Where are you--?

350
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:21,666
[NOELLE yelps]

351
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,875
Really?

352
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,916
What in the world is
that lunatic thinking?

353
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,916
That was beyond cool!

354
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,583
This can't be happening to me!

355
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:37,750
I'll hook a left up there.

356
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:40,208
Man, I can't wait to see
how tough these guys are.

357
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:43,625
I sure hope they can
give me a good fight.

358
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,333
[LUCK laughs]

359
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,583
[NOELLE]
You have got to be kidding.

360
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,208
This is just ridiculous.

361
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:51,625
Captain Yami tells him
to look after the newbies,

362
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,958
and then he leaves us
the first chance he gets?

363
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:54,833
What a jerk.

364
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:56,916
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

365
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,166
Whatever traps are
in this place,

366
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,583
my sword'll slice
right through them,

367
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:01,541
no big deal. Easy.

368
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:05,458
It must be nice being
a simpleminded optimist.

369
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:08,333
Taking on a dungeon
like this is nothing.

370
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:09,500
And do you know why?

371
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:11,666
'Cause I am gonna become
the Wizard King!

372
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,666
Here we go again.

373
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:17,041
That's right, Yuno.
That job is gonna go to me.

374
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:18,250
"Yuno"?

375
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:21,250
Oh, yeah. Haven't I
mentioned him before?

376
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,291
He's an old friend.

377
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:24,833
We grew up together
in Hage Village.

378
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:27,416
We both took the Magic Knights
Entrance Exam this year.

379
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,625
The Black Bulls got me,
and the Golden Dawn got Yuno.

380
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:31,958
That's pretty amazing.

381
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:33,541
They took a commoner?

382
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:36,541
That's rare, or,
maybe unheard of.

383
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:37,583
[ASTA]
Yeah.

384
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:39,166
Yuno's pretty
amazing, all right.

385
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,583
But he isn't gonna
beat me. Not a chance.

386
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,000
Huh.

387
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,791
[NOELLE]
I suppose even little insects

388
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,833
have their own aspirations.

389
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:49,875
Come on. Let's go.

390
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,833
[ASTA] Looks like we
can cross over there.

391
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:56,083
Ready?

392
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:59,208
[NOELLE] We're alone now.
It's just the two of us.

393
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:03,541
Sylvantus--wait, no--
Nero is here, but...

394
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,666
What's up? Something wrong?

395
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:14,166
Uh! No, of course not! Insect!

396
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,041
Well? Hurry!

397
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,833
[gasps]

398
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:24,166
Oh, no! It's a trap!

399
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,833
Noelle!

400
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,791
There's... such immense power.

401
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,416
[ASTA]
Quick, Noelle, get away!

402
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,208
[gasps]

403
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:55,458
Asta!

404
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:57,916
Not again!

405
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,500
Not good.

406
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:06,958
[ASTA]
Oh, crap!

407
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:17,500
[BOTH gasp]

408
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:23,750
[ASTA grunts]

409
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,541
Where'd that come from?

410
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:35,875
Such powerful magic.

411
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:40,708
And precision, too.
But, whose spell was that?

412
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:42,833
Oh, yeah. Forgot to mention.

413
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:44,166
Captain?

414
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,666
Luck and the rookies won't
be alone in the dungeon.

415
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,083
Some Golden Dawn Knights
were sent to explore it, too.

416
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,083
What?

417
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,958
The Golden Dawn's
gonna be there?

418
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:53,458
They sure will.

419
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:56,208
Think the kids can
play nice together?

420
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:07,291
[YUNO]
And with that...

421
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,000
[YUNO]
...my debt is paid.

422
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:14,500
Asta.

423
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:15,583
Hey, Yuno!

424
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:51,000
[FULL CAST]
Clover Clips!

425
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:56,083
[FINRAL]
"What is Mana?"

426
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,833
All right, Asta, let's hear it.

427
00:22:57,916 --> 00:22:59,208
Can you tell me
something about mana?

428
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:00,500
Yes!

429
00:23:00,583 --> 00:23:02,666
One thing I know is
this is how you write it.

430
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,625
See, there it is: mana.

431
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:06,750
Write it like this,
and it's "man alive."

432
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:08,083
--[MAGNA groans]
--That's right.

433
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:10,291
And mana is supernatural energy.

434
00:23:10,375 --> 00:23:12,916
It's a vital force in this
world that all mages call upon.

435
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,916
Yeah, and everyone has it,

436
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,500
whether they're a
noble or a commoner.

437
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:19,416
Everyone but me!

438
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,833
[FINRAL]
As I was saying,

439
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:23,625
mages call upon mana
to cast spells.

440
00:23:23,708 --> 00:23:26,125
If you don't have enough
mana, you're out of luck.

441
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:28,708
You can't use magic
until it's restored.

442
00:23:28,791 --> 00:23:30,000
You getting all this?

443
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:31,791
Yeah, I got it.

444
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:35,583
[FINRAL]
Oh! What a lovely flower!

445
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:37,416
I think this would make
an excellent present

446
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,500
for some lucky lady.

447
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:40,541
I'll save you!

448
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:43,250
[FINRAL muffled]
My! How feisty.

449
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:45,500
We can pick up the lesson later.

450
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:49,708
[LUCK] Wow, you guys have
some major magic power.

451
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:51,000
C'mon, let's fight!

452
00:23:51,083 --> 00:23:53,500
I'm putting everything
on the line.
