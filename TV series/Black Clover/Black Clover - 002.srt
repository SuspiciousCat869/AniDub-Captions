1
00:00:12,291 --> 00:00:15,208
[ASTA]
It's not over. I'm not done.

2
00:00:15,291 --> 00:00:17,375
I will be the Wizard King.

3
00:00:17,458 --> 00:00:20,250
[REVCHI]
The Wizard King? You're joking.

4
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:22,541
The thing is, these
chains can measure

5
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:25,458
the magic power of anyone
they come in contact with.

6
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:28,291
And you have none,
not a single drop.

7
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:29,625
[gasps]

8
00:00:29,708 --> 00:00:31,333
You were probably born that way.

9
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:34,583
I guess this explains why
you didn't get a grimoire.

10
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:37,125
To possess not the slightest
bit of magic in a world

11
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:38,708
where magic is everything?

12
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:42,166
Why, that makes you a rare
and precious bird, indeed!

13
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,916
[REVCHI laughs]

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,375
[ASTA]
If that's true, then...

15
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:51,000
No matter how hard
I push myself,

16
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:54,125
I'll never be able to use magic.

17
00:00:54,208 --> 00:00:57,458
You know, I really can't think
of anything more pitiful.

18
00:00:57,541 --> 00:00:59,125
Forget about becoming
the Wizard King,

19
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:00,875
you'll be lucky
to just get a job.

20
00:01:00,958 --> 00:01:02,833
I bet your friend,
the genius over there,

21
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:07,125
is having a good laugh at
your expense right about now.

22
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:09,250
[ASTA]
Yeah, maybe.

23
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:12,958
Yuno's so great, the
four-leaf clover chose him.

24
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:14,583
Then there's me.

25
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:16,958
This world has no use
for someone like you,

26
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:18,583
a poor, magic-less fool.

27
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:20,958
You might as well give
it all up right now.

28
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:24,250
You were born a loser,
you worthless runt.

29
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:26,833
[ASTA]
Yeah. He's right.

30
00:01:26,916 --> 00:01:29,041
No matter how hard I try,

31
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:33,333
I guess there are some things
that just aren't possible.

32
00:01:33,416 --> 00:01:35,375
So, I might as well give--

33
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:39,583
[YUNO] Hey! Who are you
calling a loser?

34
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:41,083
Asta.

35
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:43,958
It's true that you aren't going
to become the Wizard King.

36
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:45,250
Not ever.

37
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:46,625
[REVCHI]
You hear that?

38
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:49,583
Even your little friend
knows that it's impossible.

39
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:55,625
That's because I am going
to be the Wizard King.

40
00:01:55,708 --> 00:01:57,791
[REVCHI]
What?

41
00:01:57,875 --> 00:02:00,333
You're wrong about Asta, Revchi.

42
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:02,958
[YUNO]
Very wrong.

43
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:06,583
Asta's no loser. He's my rival!

44
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:08,041
[ASTA gasps]

45
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:09,250
Huh?

46
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:11,041
This is who you would
claim as your rival?

47
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:14,166
The only person in the
world without magic?

48
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:19,208
You. Get off of me.

49
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:21,250
[REVCHI gasps]

50
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:24,916
[ASTA] Sorry you had to see me
at such a weak moment, Yuno.

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,625
Just... give me a second.

52
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:30,291
That's all. Then I'll
destroy this guy.

53
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:47,666
[ASTA]
Is that... a grimoire?

54
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,583
[YUNO]
I knew it.

55
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:52,375
Like you wouldn't
be chosen, Asta?

56
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:54,125
There's no way.

57
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:58,916
[YUNO]
This is what you've always done.

58
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,250
You have a way of making
the impossible, possible.

59
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,666
[YUNO]
Now, and back then.

60
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,875
[ASTA]
I'm gonna be the Wizard King.

61
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:14,458
I'll keep you, and
everybody else safe.

62
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:17,166
No more worrying
about food or money.

63
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,625
You'll have everything
you ever wanted.

64
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:23,333
I'll prove it.
I'll show them all.

65
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:25,125
Show them? Prove what?

66
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:31,000
That even if you're poor,
a commoner and an orphan,

67
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:33,833
you can still become
the Wizard King.

68
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:10,000
[YUNO panting]

69
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:12,833
[YUNO]
W-Wait up!

70
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:14,458
[panting]

71
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:15,791
[yelps]

72
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:19,083
[ASTA]
Yuno!

73
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:21,125
Oh, jeez! Are you okay?

74
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:25,541
[ASTA]
Wanna hand?

75
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,666
Yeah, thank you.

76
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:35,666
[ASTA] Sheesh. You're such
a crybaby sometimes.

77
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,000
[YUNO]
I know.

78
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:38,750
C'mon, you're gonna be okay.

79
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:42,250
You know I've always
got your back, right?

80
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,250
Yeah!

81
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:48,625
[ASTA]
Okay! Let's get going, then.

82
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:51,208
They're all waiting
for us up top!

83
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:53,500
[laughs]

84
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,750
This bread is yummy.

85
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:12,625
Yummy, but a bit hard, maybe.

86
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:14,416
Amazing, Sister Lily!

87
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,250
You're the best cook and
awesomest baker ever!

88
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:20,583
Hey, when I grow up,
we should get married,

89
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,708
and you can cook for me.

90
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:25,208
Actually, Father's the
one who baked that.

91
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:28,083
So maybe you should marry him.

92
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:29,625
Nuh-uh! He's gross!

93
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:32,375
I wanna marry you, Sister,
not some old man!

94
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:33,625
Sister!

95
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:38,291
Marry, marry, marry me!
Marry, marry, marry me!

96
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:41,000
[LILY]
That's a good boy, Asta.

97
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:43,291
I'm telling you,
it'll never work.

98
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:44,958
She can't marry.

99
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:49,000
She's, um... Sister Lily
is a woman of the cloth.

100
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:50,375
I'm not giving up!

101
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:52,666
I'll keep asking her
till I'm old and gray.

102
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,750
She'll say yes eventually!

103
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:59,000
[YUNO]
Well, good luck.

104
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:08,166
[LILY] "And so, a deep, cold,
and seemingly endless darkness

105
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,708
covered the world.

106
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:13,333
It was on the brink of being
destroyed by a ruthless demon."

107
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:15,458
That demon's a jerk!

108
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:20,416
[LILY] "But then, one brave
mage stepped forward."

109
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,041
[ASTA]
Whoa!

110
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:24,291
[LILY] "Hoping to dispel
the darkness and bring dawn

111
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:28,125
to the world,
he battled the demon."

112
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:29,458
Huh?

113
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:32,500
[LILY] "Finally, he defeated
the foul creature,

114
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:35,833
and when he was finished,
the world was a brighter place

115
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:37,833
than it had ever been before."

116
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,250
"The long night ended at last,

117
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:43,125
because the mage had brought
dawn to the world."

118
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:45,125
[ASTA]
Hooray!

119
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,541
[LILY] "The triumphant mage
was hailed as the Wizard King,

120
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:57,208
and his story became legend."

121
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,500
[BOTH]
Wow! The Wizard King?

122

"Peace and prosperity reigned."

[BOTH gasp]

124
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,000
[ASTA]
Hey, Sister.

125
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,583
There's still one now, right?

126
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,083
A Wizard King, I mean.

127
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,166
Yes.

128
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,875
[LILY] That role is one of
the most vital in the kingdom.

129
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:32,250
The duty has been passed
down throughout the ages,

130
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,500
from one Wizard King
to the next.

131
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:40,041
[LILY] With the power of
his magic to protect us,

132
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,083
we live in relative safety.

133
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:43,416
It's because of the Wizard King

134
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,458
that the Clover Kingdom
is so peaceful.

135
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:47,500
[ASTA]
Oh, wow!

136
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:50,125
[YUNO] So, he's a really
important person?

137
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:53,666
[LILY] Yes. Second only
to our nation's king.

138
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,291
[YUNO]
Huh...

139
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:00,750
[ASTA]
All right! It's settled.

140
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:04,250
[LILY] What do you mean?
What's settled?

141
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:05,666
[ASTA]
I'm...

142
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,583
...gonna be the Wizard King.

143
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:12,375
Uh...

144
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:14,875
[ASTA]
Sister?

145
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:18,083
[LILY] Sorry. I'm
surprised, that's all.

146
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:20,916
So, where did this come from?

147
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,166
[ASTA] Well, he beat
the demon, didn't he?

148
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,958
So, he's way strong,
and he's super cool, too!

149
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:31,041
I wanna be just like
him when I grow up.

150
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:32,333
And, that's not all.

151
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:34,083
[gasps]

152
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:35,958
He's important.

153
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:39,250
The Wizard King has power,
and that means

154
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:41,666
I can make all of
your lives better.

155
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:44,833
[ASTA]
Think about it.

156
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:48,166
Wearing nice clothes, filling up
on as much food as you want.

157
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:52,000
I'll rebuild the church. Yeah,
I'll fix this crumbling dump!

158
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:54,291
[LILY]
Now, don't call it that.

159

How could you get a grimoire?
And that sword?

318
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,583
What kind of freak
of nature are you?

319
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:02,791
[yells]

320
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:12,541
You took my spell
and turned it into

321
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,833
your magic power?

322
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:23,208
Even without
traditional magic power,

323
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:25,375
I will be the Wizard King!

324
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,625
[screams]

325
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:30,791
My magic is never giving up!

326
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:37,791
[ASTA yells]

327
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,875
[REVCHI grunts]

328
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:57,083
[ASTA pants]

329
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:59,750
I always figured,
if I can't use magic,

330
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:01,750
at least I can use my body.

331
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:03,583
I trained to build up
strength, and it looks like

332
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:06,375
it's finally paid off.

333
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:07,916
[YUNO]
Asta.

334
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:20,000
[YUNO]
Asta! Hang in there.

335
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:24,666
I'm sorry. It's all
my fault. I'm so sorry.

336
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:28,208
[ASTA] This? Please.
Don't worry about it.

337
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:31,416
This is nothin'. After all,

338
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,333
I'm gonna be the
Wizard King, right?

339
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:36,625
I'm gonna be the Wizard King.

340
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:40,083
I'll keep you and
everybody else safe.

341
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:42,875
No more worrying
about food or money.

342
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:45,208
You'll have everything
you ever wanted.

343
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:50,041
[ASTA] I'll prove it.
I'll show them all.

344
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:51,708
"Show them"? Prove what?

345
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:57,583
That even if you're poor,
a commoner and an orphan,

346
00:19:57,666 --> 00:20:00,625
you can still become
the Wizard King.

347
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:02,583
You really think so?

348
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,333
[ASTA]
Yeah!

349
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:07,458
Commoners? Orphans?

350
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:10,000
Anybody can do it.

351
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,666
As long as they're
willing to work hard.

352
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,666
[YUNO]
Anybody?

353
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:17,791
Even me, and even you.

354
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:19,375
[gasps]

355
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:28,083
I... I'm never
going to cry again.

356
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:29,791
I've decided.

357
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:32,666
Whatddya mean?

358
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,250
I'll do it, too.

359
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:37,000
I'm going to become
the Wizard King.

360
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:39,541
I'll work hard and get
strong so I can protect you

361
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,416
and everybody else.

362
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:45,750
I'll do whatever it takes,
and I'll never give up!

363
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:54,458
Check it out, Yuno,
I got a snazzy new grimoire.

364
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:55,791
Okay, it's a little beat-up,

365
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:58,625
but I'll treasure it all
my life, anyway. I will!

366
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:02,125
[laughs]

367
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:06,208
[YUNO]
Well. You saved me yet again.

368
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:08,625
[ASTA]
Huh?

369
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:11,375
[YUNO]
I will repay my debt one day.

370
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:17,083
[YUNO]
Asta. We made a promise.

371
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:19,083
Do you remember it?

372
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:22,458
[ASTA] So, you wanna be
the Wizard King, too?

373
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:23,666
That means...

374
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,333
Yuno.

375
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:27,041
[YUNO]
Asta.

376
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:29,000
[ASTA, YUNO]
You are my rival!

377
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:33,500
I actually can't believe
you remember it.

378
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:34,750
The way you've
been acting lately,

379
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,416
I was pretty sure
you'd forgotten.

380
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:42,958
Like I'd be friendly with
someone I consider my rival.

381
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:45,708
You showed me it was possible.

382
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:47,625
Gave me hope.

383
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:49,875
That even though
we're poor orphans,

384
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:51,666
commoners,

385
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,791
we can still make
something of ourselves

386
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:57,458
in this world.
And to prove that...

387
00:21:57,541 --> 00:22:00,416
[ASTA] To make Sister Lily
and everybody else happy...

388
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:10,000
[ASTA, YUNO] ...we'll fight to
see who will be the Wizard King.

389
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:11,666
Whatever it takes.

390
00:23:47,291 --> 00:23:49,458
[ASTA]
So what if I can't use magic?

391
00:23:49,541 --> 00:23:51,541
I'm still gonna join
a Magic Knight squad

392
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:53,541
and become the Wizard King.

393

<i>Black Clover</i> , Page Three:
"To the Royal Capital!"

394
00:23:58,041 --> 00:24:00,875
My magic is never giving up!
