00:00:23,763 --> 00:00:25,640
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:25,724 --> 00:00:28,768
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:32,105 --> 00:00:34,399
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:34,482 --> 00:00:37,027
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:43,491 --> 00:00:45,493
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:45,577 --> 00:00:49,497
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

[YUNO gasps]

11
00:01:05,513 --> 00:01:07,307
[YUNO]
Again!

00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:08,892
[YUNO gasps]

13
00:01:10,393 --> 00:01:12,979
[YUNO] I don't know if
it's a magic stone or not,

14
00:01:13,063 --> 00:01:16,274
but that belongs to me.
Give it back!

15
00:01:16,358 --> 00:01:18,234
[RHYA]
Nice job, Ronne!

16
00:01:18,318 --> 00:01:21,905
And, now, we can finally
make things right.

17
00:01:21,988 --> 00:01:23,948
Indeed.

18
00:01:28,578 --> 00:01:31,790
[RHYA]
I can tell when someone's lying.

19
00:01:31,873 --> 00:01:35,210
And I wonder why you told
a lie just now. Ronne?

20
00:01:35,293 --> 00:01:37,253
What's going on?

21
00:01:37,337 --> 00:01:39,631
[RHYA]
Who the hell are you?

22
00:01:41,883 --> 00:01:44,761
[growling]

23
00:01:47,472 --> 00:01:50,183
[RHYA] Don't tell me,
this reincarnation...

24
00:01:50,266 --> 00:01:51,810
It can't be.

25
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,867
[RHYA] Elves have long sought
revenge on the humans

26
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:34,621
for the betrayal that brought
about our destruction.

27
00:03:34,704 --> 00:03:37,374
However, because I can
see through lies,

28
00:03:37,457 --> 00:03:39,000
I knew the truth.

29
00:03:39,084 --> 00:03:43,296
He didn't actually
betray us at all.

30
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:46,758
But I chose not to tell
everyone what I knew.

31
00:03:46,841 --> 00:03:48,802
Because the last thing
I wanted was to see

32
00:03:48,885 --> 00:03:52,931
their hatred of humans
diminished by that fact.

33
00:03:53,014 --> 00:03:56,184
No matter how many
lies I had to tell,

34
00:03:56,267 --> 00:03:59,104
I wanted to see him
one last time.

35
00:03:59,187 --> 00:04:03,108
That was my disloyalty.

36
00:04:03,191 --> 00:04:04,526
And for that transgression,

37
00:04:04,609 --> 00:04:07,862
I earned a giant hole
in my chest. But, still.

38
00:04:07,946 --> 00:04:09,864
What in the world
is this wretched thing

39
00:04:09,948 --> 00:04:12,701
that created the hole
in the first place?

40
00:04:12,784 --> 00:04:15,829
That thing is the
biggest liar of all.

41
00:04:15,912 --> 00:04:18,707
How long has it been
posing as Ronne?

42
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:21,876
How long has it
blended in with us?

43
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,837
[PATRY]
No!

44
00:04:26,756 --> 00:04:28,800
[PATRY]
Rhya! Rhya!

45
00:04:29,884 --> 00:04:32,429
What's the meaning
of this? Ronne?

46
00:04:34,305 --> 00:04:36,516
The three leaves of the clover.

47
00:04:36,599 --> 00:04:40,770
They represent integrity,
hope, and love.

48
00:04:40,854 --> 00:04:43,732
Within a fourth leaf,
dwells good luck.

49
00:04:43,815 --> 00:04:48,111
And, within a fifth,
there resides a devil.

50
00:04:48,194 --> 00:04:49,612
[PATRY gasps]

51
00:04:49,696 --> 00:04:52,907
That reminds me of
the day I took advantage

52
00:04:52,991 --> 00:04:55,910
of two mages chosen
by four-leaf grimoires,

53
00:04:55,994 --> 00:04:59,956
and used their pain to create
a grimoire of despair.

54
00:05:04,753 --> 00:05:06,379
Now I can finally obtain

55
00:05:06,463 --> 00:05:08,340
what should have been
mine all along.

56
00:05:08,423 --> 00:05:11,384
[YUNO] This magic...
it doesn't belong to an elf!

57
00:05:11,468 --> 00:05:14,554
[RONNE] Here, in the Shadow
Palace, a place that lies

58
00:05:14,637 --> 00:05:16,723
between this world and the next,

59
00:05:16,806 --> 00:05:19,392
I can use this to
bring me what I want.

60
00:05:19,476 --> 00:05:21,561
Out of the land of the dead.

61
00:05:28,276 --> 00:05:29,444
[gasps]

62
00:05:38,453 --> 00:05:41,289
[gasps] At long last.

63
00:05:44,292 --> 00:05:46,294
I have returned.

64
00:05:49,464 --> 00:05:51,049
Ronne, no!

65
00:05:58,014 --> 00:06:00,475
What is this?
A pitch-black magic?

66
00:06:00,558 --> 00:06:02,769
And why is it so cold!

67
00:06:09,234 --> 00:06:12,112
[PATRY]
Don't tell me. Is he...?

[cackling]

69
00:06:20,078 --> 00:06:21,663
[PATRY]
A devil?

70
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,042
This creature. What is he?

71
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:33,466
[KOTODAMA DEVIL cackles]
Though it's still incomplete,

72
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:37,095
it's been centuries since
I've been in my own body!

73
00:06:37,178 --> 00:06:40,265
And it's such
a wonderful feeling.

74
00:06:42,642 --> 00:06:43,977
[KOTODAMA DEVIL]
You've used your four-leaf

75
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:48,106
grimoire well, elf.
I commend you.

76
00:06:48,189 --> 00:06:51,818
I praise you from the
bottom of my black heart

77
00:06:51,901 --> 00:06:54,112
for all that you've done
up to this moment

78
00:06:54,195 --> 00:06:55,822
and the results you've shown me.

79
00:06:55,905 --> 00:06:56,948
And now,

80
00:06:57,032 --> 00:06:59,409
you shall taste the
depths of despair,

81
00:06:59,492 --> 00:07:01,995
just as another did
all those centuries ago!

82
00:07:02,078 --> 00:07:09,044
[PATRY] Another? But, who?
What is going on here?

83
00:07:09,127 --> 00:07:10,462
That day,

84
00:07:10,545 --> 00:07:13,048
the one who tricked the humans
into betraying the elves

85
00:07:13,131 --> 00:07:16,926
was none other than...
why, me, of course!

86
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:18,178
[PATRY gasps]

87
00:07:18,261 --> 00:07:20,597
[KOTODAMA DEVIL]
They were so easy to manipulate.

88
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,682
Humans will do
anything for power.

89

Let's foster understanding.

90
00:07:24,768 --> 00:07:26,978
[KOTODAMA DEVIL] And then you
lot made it even easier,

91
00:07:27,062 --> 00:07:29,898
letting me trick you
in the most amusing way!

92
00:07:29,981 --> 00:07:32,484
The revenge went
exactly as planned.

[KOTODAMA DEVIL cackles]

You're nothing but
a bunch of fools!

to Captain Vangeance!

Your carelessness
will get him killed.

101
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,476
[KOTODAMA DEVIL cackles]
I'll deal with you later.

102
00:08:06,559 --> 00:08:07,727
I have things to do.

103
00:08:07,811 --> 00:08:10,855
[YUNO] I don't think so.
You'll deal with me now.

Whatever kind of
monster you may be,

105

I won't let you have your way.

If all I have to do
to end this nightmare

107
00:08:16,403 --> 00:08:19,239
is destroy you, then so be it!

As a direct result
of your efforts,

time will start
moving for me again.

Without you, we wouldn't
be here now, hero.

Five centuries ago,

00:11:05,864 --> 00:11:09,034
though I came close,
my incarnation failed.

Rather than admit defeat,

I selected you to be
my next unwitting pawn.

oh-so-easily swayed.

Tragedy, a sense of purpose,
a mission to fulfill.

173
00:11:26,843 --> 00:11:29,346
That was all it took to turn
you to the forbidden magic

00:11:29,429 --> 00:11:33,016
that would reincarnate the
elves' souls in human form.

No, you have it wrong. Not me.

176
00:11:35,602 --> 00:11:38,980
Licht was the one who
reincarnated us in human bodies.

177
00:11:39,064 --> 00:11:41,399
It's true, he delved
into forbidden magic,

178
00:11:41,483 --> 00:11:44,736
but he did it for us.
He gave us a chance!

179
00:11:44,819 --> 00:11:46,279
You're incorrect.

180
00:11:46,363 --> 00:11:49,657
Truth is, he had nothing to do
with your reincarnation.

181
00:11:49,741 --> 00:11:51,159
All me, I'm afraid.

He doesn't want to
exterminate humanity.

The restoration of the elves,
the revenge you so longed for;

You merely followed the path

that I laid for you and led

You did a truly splendid job.

I couldn't have asked
for a more useful tool.

192

And, in the end,
it brought about a future

193
00:12:29,698 --> 00:12:32,992
Licht would never want,
and my incarnation,

I'm like him.
I am just like Licht.

The four-leaf clover chose me.

Well, you were chosen,
that's true.

00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:36,041
But, you might as well try
to have some fun with it.

318
00:19:38,251 --> 00:19:40,295
[KOTODAMA DEVIL]
So, the exit's above?

319
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:46,468
Now, then, if you'll excuse me.

320
00:19:46,551 --> 00:19:48,845
I must bid you farewell!

321
00:19:48,928 --> 00:19:50,930
Where do ya think you're going?!

322
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:53,475
[ASTA gasps]

323
00:20:33,264 --> 00:20:34,683
Tch.

324
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:14,097
[ASTA yells]

325
00:21:28,111 --> 00:21:29,863
[ASTA]
Yuno!

326
00:21:29,946 --> 00:21:31,656
Mana Zone...

327
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:35,201
...Spirit Storm!

[gasps]

329
00:21:50,592 --> 00:21:52,052
I wish you'd stop!

330
00:21:52,135 --> 00:21:54,763
I doubt you can forgive me,
since I'm a human,

331
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:56,681
and I can't forgive you, either.

332
00:21:56,765 --> 00:22:00,185
But, still, I know this.

333
00:22:00,268 --> 00:22:02,687
We should've been able
to understand each other!

334
00:22:02,771 --> 00:22:05,023
I'm begging you: please stop!

335
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:12,697
Hatred.

336
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:20,663
Oh, no. This spell...

337
00:23:56,968 --> 00:23:58,928
[ASTA] No matter what's
happened in the past.

338
00:23:59,012 --> 00:24:01,556
No matter what hardships and
pain we've been through,

339
00:24:01,639 --> 00:24:04,100
I know we can
understand each other!

340
00:24:04,184 --> 00:24:07,145
Next time, on
<i>Black Clover</i> , Page 116:

341
00:24:07,228 --> 00:24:08,897
"The Ultimate Natural Enemy!"

342
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,899
I am never going to give up!
