1
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:15,666
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,458
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,666
[NARRATOR] All seemed
lost until a lone mage

4
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,250
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,750
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:39,625
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:43,875
[NARRATOR] Both Black Bulls
and Temple mages

8
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:46,458
battled against Vetto of
the Third Eye to prevent him

9
00:00:46,541 --> 00:00:50,375
from staging a massacre and
obtaining the magic stone.

10
00:00:50,458 --> 00:00:51,708
Ready, Kiato?!

11
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:52,708
Yeah!

12
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:54,291
[grunts]

00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:55,125
[ASTA yells]

14
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:56,458
[yells]

15
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:01,541
How tedious.

16
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:03,916
Sluggish moves, glancing blows.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,416
But what should I expect
from magicless trash

18
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,958
and underwater scum?
You're pathetic.

19
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:12,000
Now you're askin' for it,
you overgrown furball.

20
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:14,958
[ASTA, KIATO] We'll do whatever
we have to, to bring you down!

21
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:17,166
[BOTH yelling]

22
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,041
[NARRATOR] Though Asta and
Kiato put up a fierce fight,

23
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:22,916
Vetto's strength was
simply too great.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,583
You had some hope left?

25
00:01:24,666 --> 00:01:27,541
An attack like that
is child's play to me.

26
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:29,875
You'll have to do a lot better.

27
00:01:29,958 --> 00:01:31,458
[ASTA]
Not yet.

28
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:36,166
[VETTO cackles]
Looking at you disgusts me.

29
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:39,750
Fighting with objects you
aren't even worthy to touch.

30
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:42,958
[ASTA]
Get to the point already!

31
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:44,166
[ASTA grunts]

32
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,750
[VETTO] You and your
worthless friends never

33
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:48,000
had a chance of defeating me.

34
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:49,458
[ASTA grunts]

35
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:51,375
[VETTO]
Go on. Howl!

36
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:54,958
--Embrace your despair!
--[yells]

37

[ASTA muffled] No one ever
protected anybody by giving up!

38
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:00,916
What?

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,500
[KAHONO singing]

40
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:06,750
[VETTO]
Hm?

41
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:08,000
[BOTH]
What he said was,

42
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:10,916
"No one ever protected
anybody by giving up!"

43
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:47,541
Noelle.

44
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:49,291
Kahono!

45
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:51,125
[VETTO]
So, you two are next.

46
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:53,916
At least try to entertain me.

47
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:01,208
No. Dad!

48
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:03,833
[NOELLE]
Magna and Luck are down, too.

49
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:05,166
Asta!

50
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,625
[NOELLE] All before we
could even get here.

51
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:14,291
What kind of monster
are we up against?

52
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,166
[laughs]

53
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:24,666
Not done!

54
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,208
Go away.

55
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:27,208
Insect!

56
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:29,000
[ASTA screams]

57
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:31,708
Asta!

Song Magic: Rhythm Cushion!

59
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,833
[NOELLE]
Thank you, Kahano!

60
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:39,083
A thousand yul should cover it.

61
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:42,458
Ha! I'll give you 100
times that if we survive.

62
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:43,708
[KAHONO giggles]

63
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:46,833
Now. We need to get the
others on their feet.

64
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:49,333
Can you use your Recovery Magic?

65
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:50,541
[KAHONO]
Well, I can.

66
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:51,791
But do you really
think he'll wait

67
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:55,083
until I'm done
singing to attack?

68
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:56,708
--[clattering]
--What's that?

00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,541

00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,708
[gasps]

71
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:05,500
Hey!

72
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:10,291
Big Brother! Why the
heck are you sleeping?!

73
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:12,708
We've got a promise
to keep, remember?!

74
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,000
We're never gonna get famous

75
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:17,250
if we let this
beast man kill us!

76
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:18,416
Did you forget about

77
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,208
our singing, dancing
brother-sister act?

78
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:23,333
No, of course I didn't!

79
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:25,000
Wait: "Big Brother"?

80
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,083
Yep, that good-for-nothin'
dum-dum over there

81
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:28,791
is my big brother Kiato.

82
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:31,041
Who are you calling
good-for-nothing?

83
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,958
[KIATO] If I hadn't deflected
the force of that punch

84
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:39,208
with my Dance Magic, I'd be
missing a head right now.

85
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:41,916
He'll be impossible
to beat. But...

86
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,541
My brother and I have a dream.
We're gonna go ashore someday!

87
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:48,500
Yeah, that's right!
We can't give up now.

88
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:51,791
We won't let our
dream die! Let's go!

89
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:53,000
Yeah!

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,875
[NOELLE] I can feel it.
The mana's getting stronger!

93
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:15,750
[KIATO, KAHONO]
Combo Spell:

Now, Sea God Slash!

[KIATO] Compound Magic that
combines Song and Dance.

00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:27,208
Kahano's singing enhances
my Dance Magic,

allowing me to release
enormous strikes

You're doing well. You can
defeat him. I know you can!

104
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:54,208
Ever since you were little,
you've both worked

105
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:56,916
so hard to make your
dreams come true!

Phew!

108
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,500
That oughta be enough
practicing for today,

don'tcha think?

110
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:19,416
Nuh-uh.

111
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,500
If you wanna be rich someday,
you gotta try harder than that.

112
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:23,708
I guess you're right.

113
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:25,875
Becoming a star dancer is tough.

114
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:27,333
[KAHONO]
Mm-hm. Yeah.

115
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:29,833
And besides, we don't
just wanna be famous.

116

We wanna please
the sea god, too.

That's right!

This place is what
shaped our magic!

It's been woven into the
very fabric of our lives.

132
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:17,916
Generations of our people
have praised the sea god

[KAHONO] We've been practicing
all of our lives.

135
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:26,333
Each song and each dance is
an offering to the sea god.

136
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:29,208
To him, and to everyone we love!

This magic bonds the people
of the Underwater Temple.

[NOELLE]
Run away?

327
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:47,458
Leave them?

328
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,125
Not a chance!

329
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:57,583
You have a lot of
resolve, for a mouse.

330
00:19:57,666 --> 00:20:01,250
And that's what will
kill you. Now, begone!

331
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:07,375
Mythical Beast Magic:
Epohlla Puevig!

334
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:12,708
[NOELLE] That last spell
drained all my power!

[OCEAN DWELLERS yelling]

Asta! You saved me!

340
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:59,541
[laughs] That's our boy.

341
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,833
[ASTA]
Not yet. It's not...

342
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:03,500
It's not over.

343
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:06,416
You haven't won!

344
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,958
We haven't given up,
and we're not going to!

345
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:13,291
You're right. It isn't over yet.

346
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:16,250
The real despair starts now!

347
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:18,750
[VETTO laughs]

348
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:56,750

[VETTO]
"Mythical Beast Magic!"

350
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:04,916
Mythical Beast Magic
spell was called?

351
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Do you really wanna
know, bug? Fine then.

352
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:08,500
[NOELLE]
Who're you calling "bug"?!

353
00:23:08,583 --> 00:23:10,708
I'm royalty, thank you!

354
00:23:10,791 --> 00:23:12,541
[VETTO]
This is the spell.

355
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:14,333
Well, go ahead. Read it.

356
00:23:14,416 --> 00:23:15,833
I can't.

357
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:18,458
--It's easy: Epohlla Puevig.
--Huh?

358
00:23:18,541 --> 00:23:20,375
Come on! Epohlla Puevig.

359
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:22,791
Picky Peggy Piper picked a
peck of pickled persimmons?

360
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:24,041
Not even close.

361
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:26,541
Listen to me one more
time: Epohlla Puevig!

362
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:28,708
Whales and dolphins may
look like big fish,

363
00:23:28,791 --> 00:23:29,958
but they're actually mammals.

364
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:32,208
Thickness is the only
difference between udon,

365
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:33,625
<i>somen</i> , and <i>hiyamugi</i> .

366
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:36,083
Hawks are smaller than eagles,
but they're also faster.

367
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:38,000
Really, I didn't know that!

368
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,416
Ha! Of course I knew
that sort of thing.

369
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,333
I am royalty, after all.

370
00:23:42,416 --> 00:23:44,916
[VETTO] I have no idea
what just happened.

371
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:50,250
[VETTO] Insects, I have grown
tired of your incessant buzzing.

372
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:53,958
I shall crush each and every
one of you with my own hand!

373
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:57,625
<i>Black Clover</i> , Page 47:
"The Only Weapon."

374
00:23:57,708 --> 00:24:00,666
My magic is devouring despair!
