[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:18,291
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:24,416
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,958
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:35,708
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:39,916
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:44,041
[NARRATOR] His arms now restored
by the Queen of Witches,

8
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:46,541
Asta and the others were
fighting to protect the Forest

9
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:50,333
from enemy forces when they were
suddenly confronted by Fana.

10
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:52,583
a leading member of the
Eye of the Midnight Sun

11
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:55,208
who also possesses a third eye.

12

[ASTA]
She's got that third eye, too!

15
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:10,583
[NOELLE] Everything is riding
on this single shot!

16
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:14,958
Water Creation Magic:
Sea Dragon's Roar!

17
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:16,791
[NARRATOR] Our heroes
appeared to be helpless

18
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:19,083
as Fana's fire spirit,
Salamander, began

19
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:20,833
to lay waste to the Forest.

20
00:01:20,916 --> 00:01:23,083
But, thanks to a powerful
attack generated

21
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,833
by Noelle's Water Magic,
they were able to subdue

22
00:01:25,916 --> 00:01:26,958
the terrible beast.

23
00:01:27,041 --> 00:01:31,083
Okay! Finally time
for my special move!

24
00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:33,791
[NARRATOR] For the finishing
blow, Asta used Bull Thrust,

25
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:36,750
a fighting technique
he had just invented.

26
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:38,416
Here we go!

27
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:45,416
[ASTA]
Bull Thrust!

28
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:26,250
[QUEEN OF WITCHES] To think
that imperfect little rat

29
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:28,458
had this much power.

30
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:34,166
So it appears he wasn't
all bark and no bite.

31
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,625
And those other troops...

32
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:48,208
I dunno who this is,

33
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:50,250
but I'm guessing
he isn't a witch.

34
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:54,541
He must have guts to stand up to
this huge army all by himself.

35
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:56,083
Either that, or he's stupid.

36
00:03:56,166 --> 00:04:00,000
Mars! You remember me, right?

37
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:01,416
Wait a minute now!

38
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,416
I might be totally
off base here,

39
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,750
but I think that guy
is our old teacher!

40
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,083
Yes, Ladros.

41
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09,583
And it looks like
I get the honor

42
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,750
of tormenting you!

43
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:14,916
Lucky me!

44
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,333

Ooh! Still got it, huh?

46
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:25,500
You two have changed
quite a bit,

47
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:28,666
and I can see that it's
not for the better.

48
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,791
You leave me no choice...

49
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:35,416
...but to atone for my mistake!

50
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,416
Ooh! Feel that breeze?
Nice and gentle!

51
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,375
I'll ask you this one time.

52
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:43,750
Any chance you'll turn back?

53
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:47,250
[LADROS laughs] Well, we're
the ones with the army,

54
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:49,416
so I'm thinkin' that's our line.

55
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,333
See, here's the thing.

56
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:54,875
It turns out our king isn't in
the best of health these days.

57
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:56,833
And from what we've
been hearing,

58
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:58,666
the Queen of Witches
has been around

59
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,416
for hundreds of years now.

60
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,291
The King wants to
find out her secret,

61
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:07,083
even if it means wiping out
everyone in this pitiful Forest.

62
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:08,416
So when we got word that

63
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,708
the Eye of the Midnight Sun
was already planning

64
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:13,291
to stir up trouble here,
we thought we might as well

65
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:18,083
take advantage of the confusion
and make this a real party!

66
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:20,708
We want something,
we take it by force!

67
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:22,333
That's always been
our philosophy

68
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:23,958
in the Diamond Kingdom, right?

69
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:27,000
Which is why I left
and never went back.

70
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:31,458
Now!

Heh.

charging right for us?

and combat instructor before
he double-crossed us!

but the materials

162
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:54,625
only cost me about
3,000 yul each!

163
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:56,625
That much destruction
for so cheap--

164
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:58,000
what a value!

165
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:59,708
[DOMINANTE]
Now's our chance, ladies!

166
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:03,208
Don't let those lawless brutes
ransack our beautiful Forest!

167
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:06,333
Show them that these
witches mean business!

168
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,541
[LADROS]
Well, well!

169
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,125
They set a trap
down there thinking

170
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:13,625
we would barrel right into it!

171
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:16,333
It's probably better
if we tread carefully.

172
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:20,583
But it kind of looks
like fun, so here I go!

173
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:23,458
Whatever the game
is, let's play!

174
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,750
Now then, where could they be?

175

Uh-oh!

176

[FANZELL]
Exactly what I thought you'd do.

177
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:32,333

Oh, rats! Guess you got me!

181
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:44,125
For the last time, do you
want to turn around?

182
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,750
[LADROS]
Hm.

183
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,625
Now where would be
the fun in that?

184
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:52,166
I've got so much more
slaughtering left to do!

185
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:55,125
What's wrong with you? Huh?

186
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:57,750
You can't train us
to be killing machines,

187
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:01,208
only to expect us to behave
like upstanding citizens,

188
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:03,208
and during a big
battle like this?

189
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:06,541
I'm sorry, but I promised.

190
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:11,791
See, I told my last pupil--
someone younger than you...

191
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:16,791
[FANZELL] ...I'm done
running. I'm gonna live!

[FANZELL] That's it,

Calm your emotions.

197
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:47,666
Good job! Try to focus.

198
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,041
Listen.

199
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,041
Your powers are meant
for protecting people,

200
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,583
and nothing else.

201
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:55,208
Don't ever forget that, okay?

202
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:56,583
[CHILDREN]
Right!

203
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:09,875
[FANZELL] His strength was
physical Reinforcement spells.

204
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:12,041
I'll never win like this.

[FANZELL]
Mars.

208
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:25,875
Of all the students I taught,
he was the most skilled.

209
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:28,958
There's no way I stand a chance
against him at this distance.

210
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:31,208
I'll have to make some room!

[FANZELL]
Ladros.

216
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:51,541
[FANZELL]
I'm putting my all into this.

217
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:58,583
Now, Wind Creation Magic:

[screams]

219
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,666
[FANZELL] Not having
an elemental attribute

220
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:09,208
always made him
feel a little odd.

221
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:10,500
[LADROS]
Sir.

222
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:15,916
I don't need an attribute
to be strong, right?

223
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,916
[FANZELL] He gave himself
a complex over it.

224
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,125
[LADROS yelling]

225
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:21,708
[FANZELL]
But he still had greater power

226
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,208
than any of his peers.

227
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:27,875
If he knows a long-range
spell, I'm done for.

228
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:30,916
I'd better put him out quick.

229
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,958
Forgive me.

230
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:35,416
No! Stop it!

231
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,208
I can't, I can't, I can't,
I can't, I can't!

232
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:41,375
No more of your
magic, sir, please!

233
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,125
I'm downright stuffed.

[FANZELL gasps]

00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:48,041
Heh! You surprised?

236
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:51,250
[FANZELL]
There's not a scratch on him!

237
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:53,458
[LADROS]
Yeah, I've made a few changes.

238
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,708
After you left, the army
gave me one of those

239
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:59,541
upgrade surgeries and I came
out with some new tricks.

240
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:01,875
Absorption and emission.

241
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:04,375
My body can suck up
any magic attack

242
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:06,833
that's thrown at it,
and I can release

243
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:09,458
that gathered force
whenever I like.

244
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,958
You know what
that means, right?

245
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:14,416
Not only am I about to kill
all your little buddies,

246
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,541
I'm gonna use your
magic to do it!

247
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:19,875
What's this power from?
It's not just Ladros.

248
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:22,708
There's so much,
it must be something else!

249
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:24,291
By the way, Teach.

250
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:26,166
You didn't happen to
bring any loved ones

00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,541
into the Forest, did you?

'Cause if you did,
you might wanna go

check on them real quick.

254
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,125
And you'll have to
outrun my magic,

255
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:39,916
so you'd better hurry up!

256
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,375
On your marks.

So you did have someone
special here, after all!

But why haven't
you introduced us?

00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:54,166
[LADROS gasps]

321
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:57,791
[sighs]

322
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:02,958
Yay for me!

323
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,291
[LADROS]
Now I can kill you legally!

324
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:12,791
[LADROS] You've been a thorn
in my side for too damn long!

325
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:15,291
So good at everything
and so nonchalant

326
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:16,833
about it at the same time!

327
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:18,208
It's such a pain in the neck!

328
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:20,750
I always knew that if
I kept aiming for the top,

329
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,208
you would end up gettin'
in my way somehow!

330
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:25,416
And today's finally my chance.

331
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,291
I get to kill you
and our old teacher!

332
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:30,458
This is the best!

333
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:31,791
[grunts]

334
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:38,916
Mariella?

335
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,125
He's my teacher, too, you know.

336
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:44,083
Don't treat him like he's
some sort of bonus kill!

337
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,041
[LADROS] Why don't you
and your pathetic magic

338
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,375
stay out of this?

339
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,875
That's not even
enough to snack on.

340
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:01,708
There's our little
Marsie-boy for ya!

341
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:05,791
I'll take all that power and
send it back with interest!

342
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:10,208
Flame Recovery Magic:
Phoenix Robe!

343
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:14,166
But, Mars. Why would
you help us?

344
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:17,750
Ladros is right. The two
of us are traitors!

345
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:20,166
I mean, losing your memories...

346
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,708
Not to worry, sir.

347
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:23,708
I've decided I'm on your side.

348
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:26,791
Unexpected though
our reunion may be.

349
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:29,500
[LADROS]
Ooh!

350
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:31,375
We can talk later.

351
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:33,375
First, we should deal with him.

352
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:34,666
Okay.

353
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,791
But how do we handle
somebody who can do that?

354
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,416
Well, he's almost invincible,

355
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,416
but I know of a few ways
we can defeat him.

356
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,250
One is to keep feeding
him more magic

357
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:46,208
than he can absorb until
he self-destructs.

358
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:48,166
We'd have to use
Spirit Magic or get

359
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,458
the Queen of Witches to help us.

360
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:53,208
The other way is anti-magic.

361
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:56,333
Anti-magic! Asta! That's right!

362
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:57,958
It turns out we know
just the guy,

363
00:19:58,041 --> 00:19:59,791
and he happens to be waiting
at the opposite end

364
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,500
of the Forest as we speak!

365
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:02,666
[gasps]

366
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,625
[FANZELL]
Let's try to guide Ladros there.

367
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:07,125
Good idea, Master.

368
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:10,375
Hey, are you guys
talkin' about me?

369
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:12,208
Doesn't matter how
great your plan is,

370
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:14,625
it'll be useless
against my magic!

371
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:16,625
What the--?

372
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:20,041
[LADROS]
Huh?

373
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:24,083
Your power is what causes
you to be careless!

374
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:25,666
[chuckles]

375
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,958

Reinforcement spells myself.

It's over, we've got you
completely surrounded!

379
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,375
So you might as well give up!

[ASTA]
Ow, hot! Hot!

381
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:50,666
Don't bother putting up a fight!

382
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:54,208
We don't wanna hurt you,
so please don't force us to!

383
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:55,875
You're still young, right?

384
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:58,583
There's no point in you
throwing your life away!

385
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:00,750
If you do something stupid,
then your friends and family

386
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:03,708
are gonna be really sad!

387
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:05,875
You disgusting human.

388
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:08,583
Don't you dare
speak of my friends!

Tell me the truth, Mars!

393
00:22:58,458 --> 00:23:01,791
Do you know how old I am?

394
00:23:01,875 --> 00:23:03,208
You're 28.

395
00:23:03,291 --> 00:23:04,375
Ah!

396
00:23:04,458 --> 00:23:07,000
Ooh! There's no way
Teach is in his 20s!

397
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:08,166
He's 38!

398
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,916
Nobody could teach
sword-fighting like that

399
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,541
without a ton of experience.
I'd say he's 42.

400
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:17,125
Not that I care or anything,
but I think he's 46.
