humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

Hey.

[AMY] Yami? The Captain
of the Black Bulls?

162
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,208
[LOUNIE]
As in, the squad of scoundrels

163
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:18,291
who do more harm than good?
Those Black Bulls?

164
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,458
[KOZA] There's not a single
person on that squad

165
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:23,166
who doesn't have a screw loose

166
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,666
[GAYAYA] One's a shameless
flirt. One's mute.

167
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,250
What are the rest of them like?

168
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,000
Man, I hope I don't
end up on that squad.

[ASTA yelping]

[ASTA] Boy, did I pick
the wrong guy to run into!

00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,375

That was a close one, boy.

You got a second chance at life.

I wish the captain

That was a whole lot of not fun.

Ha, ha. Is your head
feeling all right?

[ASTA]
Uh, yeah.

190
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,625
Confronting Captain Yami
of the Black Bulls

191
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:25,958
without warning like that?

192
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,333
I can't say I envy you.

193
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:30,708
Oh. I'm Sekke, by the way.
Seke Bronzazza.

Ooh!

198
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:57,666
[SEKKE] That's Nozel Silva, the
Captain of the Silver Eagles.

199
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,000
One of them.

200
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:03,666
A real Magic Knight
squad captain.

201
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,125
Interesting hairstyle!

202
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:08,083
How does he see with
that thing in his face?

203
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:14,583
[SEKKE] Fuegoleon Vermillion,
captain of the Crimson Lions.

204
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:18,333
As his name suggests, he's
a Flame Creation Magic user.

205
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:20,916
[ASTA]
Wow.

206
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,916
[SEKKE] Jack the Ripper, captain
of the Green Praying Mantises.

207
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,541
Wait. What's a praying mantis?

208
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:30,125
That long, thin, green bug.

209
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:32,458
Captain Jack can rend
the very earth in two

210
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:33,541
with his Severing Magic.

211

[ASTA]
Whoa! That's awesome!

212
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,708
"Praying Mantises,"
though, seriously?

213
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:40,041
Who wants to be named for a bug?

214

[SEKKE] Next we have
Ms. Charlotte Roselei,

captain of the Blue Rose
Knights. Just look!

She's so beautiful.

[ASTA] Eh, she's got
nothin' on Sister Lily.

[SEKKE] Gueldre Poizot,
captain of the Purple Orcas.

00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:58,500
That's all ya got?

220

The shabbier ones
don't interest me.

221
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:05,916
[SEKKE] Dorothy Unsworth,
captain of the Coral Peacocks.

222
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,666
[ASTA]
Is she sleepwalking?

223
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,791
She doesn't do
anything but sleep.

224
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:12,333
How'd she become
a squad captain, then?

225
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:14,333
[SEKKE] She must have
some incredible power

226
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:17,291
that's invisible to the eye.

Rill Boismortier,
captain of the Aqua Deer.

228
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:23,750
[ASTA]
Isn't he kinda young?

229
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:26,250
A bit. Captain Rill
is 19 years old.

230
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:27,666
Nineteen, really?

231
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,458
Just four years older
than I am! Yeah!

232
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,750
I'll be the Wizard King
before I know it!

Ha, ha! The Wizard King, huh?

234
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:39,041
Now that's dreaming big, but as
for the person next in line...

[EXAMINEES cheer]

If you take a look
up there, you'll see.

That's the front-runner.

[SEKKE] He has his squad
members' complete trust.

242
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,375
I hear it was Captain
William who took

243
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:08,625
the enemy general's head in
that battle a while back.

244

[KOZA] Man, it would be awesome
to get into the Golden Dawn.

That, or the Silver Eagles.

[GAYAYA]
Don't be an idiot.

247
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:17,666
Royals and elite nobles
are the only ones

248
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,833
who ever get into those squads.

this over with.

The sooner we start,
the sooner we'll be done.

This exam is going to decide
these youths' futures.

252
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:35,666
You really shouldn't
be taking it so lightly.

253
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:39,666
You take it seriously
enough for all of us.

[SEKKE] All the captains,
here in one place.

255
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,708
[NARRATOR] Each of the
Magic Knight squad captains

00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:50,916
is said to be more powerful
than a hundred mages combined.

257
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,250
From their illustrious ranks
will come the next Wizard King.

258

And, the Wizard King?

[laughs] Like he would
bother with something

260
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:01,000
as pedestrian as an exam!

261
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:03,416
Just getting all the squad
captains in one place

262
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,291
is miraculous already.

263

to becoming the Wizard King.

You've waited long enough.

The time has come. Let the
entrance exam begin.

276
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:11,541
[WILLIAM]
In just a few moments

277
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:14,416
we'll begin the first
in a series of tests.

278
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,041
The nine Magic Knight captains
will be serving as your judges.

279
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,666
And when the exam is complete,

280
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:23,125
we will choose the individuals
we want on our squads.

281
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:25,083
If chosen, you are in.

282
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:27,208
If more than one
squad chooses you,

283
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:30,041
you will decide which
you would like to join.

284
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:33,458
However, if you are not
selected by any squad,

285
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:35,458
that means you have
been deemed unqualified

286
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:37,500
to join the Magic Knights.

287
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,416
[ASTA] That won't happen.
I will be chosen.

288
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,333
And now for your first test.

289
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:44,708
You must use the brooms
you've been given to fly.

290
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:46,083
To fly?

291
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:47,958
I've never done that before.

292
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,458
A mage who is in control

293
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:52,833
of his or her magic power
can do it on instinct alone.

294
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:56,416
It is our most basic way to
get from one place to another.

295
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,958
If you can't fly on a broom,
then you are not worth our time.

296
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:02,166
Enough talk. Now, begin.

297

This test is an excellent way

302
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:16,583
for us to gauge the
examinees' basic abilities.

303
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:19,625
Seems we have a number of
promising candidates this year.

304

[GAYAYA] Hard to believe a guy
from some backwater village

305
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:28,166
could do so well.

306

[FUEGOLEON]
What's going on there?

Even if he doesn't have
any significant talent,

00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:44,208
he should still
be able to float.

for a moment.

Can you believe this guy?

[KOZA]
Well, that's one down at least.

Why did he even bother to come?

00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:01,000
This is supposed
to be the easy part.

317
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:03,125
Try relaxing your muscles a bit.

318
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:04,916
See? It really
couldn't be simpler.

319
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,583
[ASTA]
Wow! Man, that's so awesome!

320
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,791
Don't tense up.
Let it come naturally.

321
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:12,625
Right, got it! You're a
good guy, you know.

322
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:16,916
Nope, still not happening!

323
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,208
Right!

324
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,208
[NOZEL]
What are you doing?

325
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:27,083
[NOELLE]
I just... I mean...

326
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:28,916
Don't play dumb with me.

327
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,083
I've told you,
royalty need not undergo

328
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:33,208
the same tests as common folk.

329
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:34,541
[NOELLE]
Yes, but...

330
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:37,708
Enough, where you'll
go is already decided.

331
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,041
Stop this pointless nonsense.

332
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,666
Yes. Of course, Nozel.

333
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,625
[NOZEL]
Although, if we're being honest,

334
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:47,041
your very existence
is pointless.

335

--[SEKKE] Ha, ha!

It's fine! Try to relax!

337
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,041

Ha, ha!

Ha, ha!

[ASTA yelling]
I'm not done yet!

342
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,333
[SEKKE]
Well, what's next?

343
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:16,875
--[SEKKE chuckles]

[ASTA]
Nope! Still not giving up!

345
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:25,875
On to the next test.

346
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:27,958
The final and most difficult.

347
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:29,500
A display of combat skill.

348
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:31,833
[EXAMINEES gasping, murmuring]

349
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:33,375
Prepare to duel!

350
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:34,708
[EXAMINEES gasp]

351
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:37,208
You will break into pairs
and fight each other.

352
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:40,166
Use your grimoires
to attack and defend.

353
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:43,166
I bet losing will tank your
chances of being chosen.

354
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:46,166
Better to choose an easy
partner. Someone weak.

355
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,250
As knights, battle
is our business.

356
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:51,041
We wanna see everything
you're capable of!

357
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:52,916
The test will end
when one combatant

358
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,708
either surrenders or
is unable to continue.

359
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:57,833
We have mages wielding
Recovery Magic

360
00:18:57,916 --> 00:18:59,791
standing by for the injured.

361
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,916
So don't hold anything back!

362
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,958
[ASTA yelps]
The last test!

363
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:06,291
I've done nothing but
shout this whole time.

364
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:09,666
The best way to show off now is
to pair off with someone strong.

365
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,500
There's got to be someone
who'll agree to fight me.

366
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:17,125
Ha, ha! What do you say
you and I pair up?

367
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:19,375
[ASTA]
You really mean it, Sekke?

368
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:22,083
You're willing to take on
a charity case like me?

369
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:24,291
Oh, absolutely! Ha, ha!

370
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:27,250
[ASTA]
You really are a good guy!

371
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,541
We're ready for the
first bout. Let's go.

372
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,166
We're coming!

373
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,750
Ha, ha!

374
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,208
We're both working
for the same goal.

375
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:43,041
So we'll have a fair fight, but
nobody pulls any punches, okay?

376
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:45,833
[SEKKE laughs]

377
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:47,041
Stop trying so hard.

378
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:49,375
It's almost getting
painful to watch.

379
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:50,833
You're just a grubby
little gutter rat

380
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:52,791
who's way out of his depth.

381
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:54,708
I guess I should thank you
for sticking around

382
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:56,291
and making me look good.

383
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:59,041
Once I'm chosen by a squad,
I plan to kick up my heels

384
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:00,375
and enjoy the ride.

385
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:02,458
It's going to be so much fun.

386
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:05,333
Now. Let's get this
over with, shall we?

387

[ASTA growls]

388
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:08,458
Then you can scurry on
home to the garbage heap

389
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,833
you came from, and get
back to whatever pitiful

390
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:13,208
excuse for a life you have left.

391
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:14,583
Ha, ha!

392
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,166
[KOZA]
Man, he had the right idea.

393
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,041
Picking the weakest
partner to duel.

394
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:23,208
[AMY]
Oh, Sekke...

395
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:25,458
Now, begin.

396
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:27,750
No pulling punches, remember?

397
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:30,541

Bronze Creation Magic:
Sekke Magnum Cannon ball!

399
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:44,041
[SEKKE] What do you think
of this, captains?

400
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:47,291
The bronze magic power
I've crafted is dual purpose.

401
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:50,291
It protects me and attacks
with magic bullets.

402
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,291
It will fend off
his pathetic attacks,

403
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:54,208
showing off my
skills at defense.

404
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:56,375
Then, the second he's exhausted,

405
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:58,875
I'll go on the
offensive and shoot.

406
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:01,000
That seems like some
fairly high-level magic

407
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:02,250
for an examinee.

408
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:04,041
He looks like an insect, though.

409

A big, spiny pillbug.

shy on me now. Ha, ha!

[SEKKE]
Good.

412
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:13,875
Watching him struggle
should liven things up.

Okay.
