1
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:15,666
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,583
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:24,375
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:27,166
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,583
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:39,583
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:43,458
[NARRATOR] The first round
of the Royal Knights

8
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:46,041
Selection Exam is heating up!

9
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:47,916
Asta's Team B...

10
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,166
[NARRATOR]
...Magna's Team C...

11
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:57,500
[NARRATOR]
...Finral's Team E...

12
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:04,791
[NARRATOR] ...and Langris's
Team G have each been successful

13
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:07,458
in their initial matches
and secured their spots

14
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:09,000
in the second round.

15
00:01:10,458 --> 00:01:12,250
It's too bad that you'll
never be anything more

16
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:15,875
than a means of transport.
But my magic is useful.

17
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:19,291
So do try to stay out of my
portals during the next battle.

18
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:20,583
It would be a shame

19
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:23,416
if you were to permanently
disappear somewhere.

20
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,416
Forget about what it would
do to Mother and Father.

21
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,833
I think a certain someone would
be quite devastated as well.

22
00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:30,500
Yeah, good point.

23
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,416
So if I wanna prevent that,

24
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,833
then I'll just have
to win, won't I?

25
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:13,500
[FINRAL] Man. I can't
believe I said that.

26
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:15,875
Then I'll just have
to win, won't I?

27
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:20,208
That's my dear brother.
Still insolent as ever.

28
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:22,958
[FINRAL] I wasn't trying
to make him mad at me.

29
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:25,000
[sighs]

30
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:28,833
Now then! Let's move on to match
five of the starting round!

31
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:33,000
Sweet! Here we go!

32
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,000
Hurry up already.

33
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:36,958
Members of Team I and Team J:

34
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,583
approach!

35
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:40,375
May the best fighters win.

36
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:42,500
Let's have a fair match.

37
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:43,791
I agree.

38
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:44,875
This should be fun.

39
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,041
We plan to do our best.

40
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:51,666
[ASTA] Roland, Wainsley,
Nix, Nils, Ruben...

41
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:55,166
Why is there an X, though?
I guess somebody went home.

42
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,791
I'm fairly certain "X"
is someone's name.

43
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:59,000
Really?

44
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,583
Kinda unusual.

45
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:01,958
A pseudonym?

46
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,708
[KLAUS]
Hm...

47
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:05,791
I'm sorry. One question.

48
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:07,000
What is it?

49
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:08,875
We're supposed to be
on a team with this "X,"

50
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,500
but we don't know who that is.

51
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,250
Is that person even here?

52
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:14,041
Uh...

53
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:15,750
I don't understand
what the holdup is.

54
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:18,750
Find your third team member
or you'll be disqualified.

55
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:19,833
Er, right.

56
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:21,791
If the Magic Knight
"X" is present,

57
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:24,458
then please step forward
so that we can proceed!

58
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:25,625
"X?"

59
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:30,541
[X laughs]

60
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:33,708
Whoa! What's with this guy?

61
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,041
[X laughs]

62
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:36,041
[RUBEN whimpers]

63
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,666
[ALL gasp]

64
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,208
[X]
I am the X you seek!

65
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:43,708
[ALL grunt]

66
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:49,750
Just kidding!

67
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:51,708
It was me, Captain
Rill Boismortier!

68
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,291
You guys should've
seen your faces!

69
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:58,000
It's Rill, the Aqua Deer
captain! Why's he here?

70
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:00,083
--[KLAUS gasps]
--I'm confused.

71
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,125
Isn't that the little
guy who can transform

72
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:03,875
other people's magic
power into paint

73
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:05,208
using his Picture Magic?

74
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:07,583
Yeah, why would there
be a captain here?

75
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:08,833
That's weird.

76
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:10,083
Wait.

77
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:11,541
Don't tell me there's
a rule against captains

78
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,333
participating in the exam!

79
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:15,041
That's not the case at all!

80
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:16,500
You are welcome here.

81
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:17,583
[JULIUS]
Perfect!

82
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:20,250
Now I get to see
Rill's magic as well!

83
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:23,000
Everyone's accounted for,
so get on with it!

84
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,291
No need to worry, competitors.

85
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,750
Think of this as your chance
to make a strong impression

86
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:29,250
by defeating a captain!

87
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:30,625
[MAGIC KNIGHT 76A]
He's right!

88
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:32,166
[MAGIC KNIGHT 76B] Yeah,
and the way this competition

89
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,291
is set up, we might actually
have a decent shot!

90
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,750
[laughs]

91
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:38,041
I'm doing this to give the
Aqua Deer a rankings boost

92
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:40,000
after we came in last
at the Star Festival,

93
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:41,916
so you'd better believe
I'm not gonna go down

94
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,291
without a fight today!

95
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:45,625
[WALTER]
Such determination!

96
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,750
You're a great
inspiration, young master.

97
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:51,250
I'm quite moved.

98
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:54,333
[ASTA] Now we got grandpas
flyin' in outta nowhere?

99
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:55,416
Everyone.

100
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,500
I implore you to
look kindly upon Rill

101
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,291
during this competition.

102
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:02,666
[laughs] Oh, Walt,
stop being so stuffy!

103
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,375
Hey, it's Asta!

104
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:05,708
[WALTER]
Hm?

105
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:07,333
[RILL]
Let's do our best!

106
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:09,958
Yeah! But I'm definitely
gonna beat ya!

107
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:12,208
Don't speak to a
captain so casually!

108
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:14,625
Are you guys friends
or something?

109
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:15,875
[WALTER]
Hm...

110
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,208
Okay, the old geezer's
startin' to scare me!

111
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:19,583
[whimpers]

112
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:23,000
[WALTER]
Ah.

113
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,291
And I assume you must be

114
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:26,666
the young master's
dear friend, Asta?

115
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,125
I must say, he has spoken
very highly of you.

116
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:31,083
[ASTA]
Where'd that cup come from?

117
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:32,333
It happened so fast!

118
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:34,875
Words cannot express
how deeply I appreciate

119
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:37,291
the companionship you
have shown Master Rill.

120
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,791
But forgive me, for I have
yet to introduce myself.

121
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:42,791
My name is Walter, his humble
and dedicated servant.

122
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:44,375
Please accept this.

123
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:47,083
Oh, okay, don't
mind if I do then.

124
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:52,125
[ASTA]
This is...!

125
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:54,291
What, Asta?

126
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,541
It's so fancy,
I can't even taste it!

127
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:57,375
Moron.

128
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,000
[KLAUS sighs]

129
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,458
Oh, my.

130
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:02,958
I'm so glad to see he's
finally found a friend.

131
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:05,750
Not long ago, such a thing
would've been unthinkable.

132
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,125
Wow, seriously?

133
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:09,250
I'm sorry, that sounds
like it would be rough.

134
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,541
Please do forgive my rudeness.

135
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:14,500
I cannot help it.
This is all so touching.

136
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:17,291
[RILL] Cut it out, Walt!
Don't talk about the past.

137
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:18,708
Don't you know
it's embarrassing?

138
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:21,041
[WALTER] Right! I beg
your pardon, master!

139
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:23,375
[EMCEE MAGE]
It's time to continue!

140
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:27,041
All right! I can't wait to
paint my next masterpiece!

141
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:29,541
[NILS, RUBEN] What does
he mean, "masterpiece"?

142
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,625
The fifth match of round one!

143
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:34,125
Team I: Rill, Nils, and Ruben

144
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:37,666
vs. Team J: Wainsley,
Roland, and Nix!

145
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,125
We're facing the captain
of the Aqua Deer.

146
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:41,958
I wonder what he's like?

147
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:44,916
Master Rill.

148
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,500
Begin the battle!

149
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:55,208
[RILL]
Hm...

150
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:57,416
I'm sorry, sir,
what are you doing?

151
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,333
They just said go.

152
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:01,250
[RILL]
The sky looks so pretty!

153
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:02,791
[NILS, RUBEN gasp]

154
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:06,250
I betcha I can get that exact
color if I use lapis lazuli!

155
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:08,666
You can create blue paint
by crushing up gemstones!

156
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,875
Interesting, right?

157
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:11,416
[BOTH]
Oh.

158
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,083
[RILL] Then, I'll add in a
little whitewash for the clouds.

159
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:15,916
Whitewash is a special
kind of paint that's made

160
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,666
out of seashells,
in case you didn't know.

161
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,791
Wow, I couldn't ask for
a more beautiful skyscape

162
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:24,916
for us to compete under today!

163
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,375
All right, team,
I'm ready when you are!

164
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,791
I'm about to paint a marvelous
picture on the inviting

165
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:32,125
blank canvas that
is our battlefield!

166
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:39,250
Follow my lead, okay?

167
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:42,916
Here we go!

168
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:50,166
He just up and left us.

169
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:53,375
I admire his initiative,
but that's too much.

170
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:56,083
Oh, no!

171
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:57,541
They captured me!

172
00:08:57,625 --> 00:09:00,208
They're like five seconds in
and he already screwed up?

173
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:03,333
And this boy is a
captain? Oh, dear.

174
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:05,291
He was so busy
daydreaming about the sky

175
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:07,208
that he walked
directly into a trap.

176
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,875
Well, this match is
going to be fairly brief.

177
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:11,708
[chuckles]

178
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:14,791
I didn't expect him to
be that easy to catch.

179
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:16,916
I actually feel kinda guilty.

180
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,791
He is a captain, after all.

181
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:20,750
It doesn't matter,
a win is a win.

182
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,833
We should face our foes
with our full might,

183
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:24,791
no matter how
unthreatening they are!

184
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,583
Right.

185
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,083
Works for me.

186
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,000
Here goes!

187
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:32,333
[yells]

188
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:38,208
[ROLAND] I'll use Plant
Reinforcement Magic:

189
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:40,416
Magic Pollen! Your turn!

190
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:45,500
All right, Flame Magic:
Flame Spike technique!

191
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:49,750
I'll finish this!
Ice Magic: Icicle Bridge!

192
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,041
[ROLAND, NIX, WAINSLEY] Take
that, Captain of the Aqua Deer.

193
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:55,958
You're going down!

194
00:09:57,125 --> 00:10:00,250
[RILL]
Wow. Their spells are exquisite,

195
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,833
and they know just
how to use them!

196
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:06,083
This battlefield really
is the ideal canvas.

197
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:08,125
I'm so inspired!

198
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:12,041
I feel my creativity
starting to flow, Walt!

199
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,666
Not again.

200
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,083
[VILLAGER 76B]
How many times is that today?

201
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:22,666
It's practically constant.

202
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,375
Ever since the Boismortier
child received his grimoire,

203
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,708
he's been holed up in his room,
allowing his magic to run wild.

204
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,583
[VILLAGERS gasp]

205
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:33,750
I know he's always been a
bit of a strange little boy,

206
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,291
but since the awarding ceremony,

207
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:37,541
he almost seems to be possessed.

208
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:38,958
[VILLAGER 76A]
Right.

209
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:40,916
And with that enormous amount
of power he's wielding,

210
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,958
he's impossible to control.

211
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:45,791
I hear his poor mother
is at her wit's end.

212
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,625
[VILLAGERS gasp]

213
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:51,416
[sobs] How could my
son have become

214
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,208
such a terror?

215
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,916
My lady, please calm yourself.

216
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,166
[RILL'S MOTHER]
I can't get him to listen

217
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,166
to a single word I say.

218
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:02,041
All he does is
paint all day long!

219
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,125
[sobs] My sweet boy.

--[explosion]
--[RILL'S MOTHER, MAID 76A gasp]

221
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:12,708
I don't even understand
him anymore. He's a monster!

222
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:22,708
It's wrong. Wrong, wrong,
wrong, wrong, wrong!

223
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,333
[RILL]
I hate this.

224
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:31,875
It isn't what I wanted
to paint at all!

225
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,083
[RILL]
It should be more. More!

226
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:39,291
[RILL'S MOTHER] Please stop
painting now, Rill!

227
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:41,625
How can you cause
me so much pain?

228
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:46,416
I almost wish...
No, I do wish...

229
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,833
I wish you'd never been born!

230
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:58,583
You don't understand my art,
and you never will!

231
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:00,916
Never, ever!

232
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,666
[footsteps]

233
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,166
[WALTER] Young master.
May I have a word with you?

234
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,875
[RILL]
Shut up, Walter! Get out!

235
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:21,458
[WALTER]
But, sir--

236
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:22,750
Just go!

237
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:29,833
Why can't I paint
the way I want?

238
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:33,416
Art's supposed to be
fun! This is boring!

239
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:38,166
Everybody, leave me alone!

240
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:48,125
[RILL] They have no idea
how much I'm suffering.

241
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:51,791
Not Walter. Not Mother. No one!

242
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:54,416
None of you understand me--

243
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,000
[RILL gasps]

244
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:23,500
That's good.

245
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,333
It's a relief that you're
finally able to see me properly,

246
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:28,041
young Master Rill.

247
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:29,375
Walt.

248
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,166
[WALTER]
Is your face hurting?

249
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,500
What?

250
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:35,083
When someone sustains
an injury, it causes pain.

251
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:38,166
That's the reason people are
so afraid of getting hurt.

252
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,250
We tend to be frightened of
what we fail to understand.

253
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:44,791
So we are reluctant to
draw close to such things.

254
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:50,083
That's why you should try
to understand others.

255
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:52,833
So that they can
understand you, too.

256
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,916
You love to make art.

257
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,166
Don't you want someone
else to see it as well?

258
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:02,208
Although, a tiny canvas
such as this cannot hope

259
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:05,250
to contain your outstanding
talent, young master.

260
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:07,833
Your abilities are
far too great.

261
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:10,250
It must be difficult to get
the people in your life

262
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,125
to understand you.

263
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:14,208
That's the way it is
for those who shine

264
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:17,375
as brightly as you do.

265
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:19,791
But I know of a canvas
where you can unleash

266
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:22,708
your colorful magic power
to your heart's content.

267
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:24,708
Huh? Where's that?

268
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:26,833
Join The Magic Knights.

269
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:29,291
The Magic Knights, huh?

270
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:32,583
Yes. Would you like
to give it a try?

271
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:35,208
After all, with impressive
abilities like yours,

272
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,916
you're sure to be accepted.

273
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,291
And then, you'll be
free to paint upon

274
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:43,041
the never-ending canvas that
spreads out along your path.

275
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:46,458
You'll create a
masterpiece like no other!

276
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:49,500
Do you really think
I can do that, Walt?

277
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,166
Indeed.

278
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:56,541
Well, then. I'm gonna go for it!

279
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:02,333
Oh! Sorry for hurting
you. Are you okay?

280
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:03,875
It's just a scratch, sir.

281
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:06,500
The right butler can make
anything look good as new.

[BOTH laughing]

284

Are you sure you'd prefer
not to say any goodbyes

285
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,458
before you depart, Master Rill?

286
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:30,083
[RILL]
Yeah. I won't be lonely, though.

287
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:31,708
[WALTER]
Hm?

288
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:33,875
[RILL] The people I love
will always be smiling

289
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:35,875
in the paintings in my heart.

290
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:39,208
Of course.

291
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:43,458
[laughs] I'm ready. Let's go!

I'm on my way!

293
00:15:57,291 --> 00:16:00,791
Please forgive me, son.

00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,208
Goodbye.

295
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:07,958
[WALTER] Your talents have
blossomed immensely

296
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:09,875
during your time with
the Magic Knights.

297
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:11,500
And now you're
the youngest person

298
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:12,916
ever to become a captain.

299
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,916
You are the greatest pride
of the House Boismortier!

300
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,833
[RILL] Ah, this canvas
takes my breath away!

301
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:22,250
You know what, Walt?

302
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:24,625
I'm gonna show the
world my masterpiece,

303
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:26,833
but I want you to see it first!

304
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:31,666
[RILL] 'Cause you helped me
become who I want to be!

305
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:36,000
[WALTER]
The young master's Picture Magic

306
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,375
has a unique capability.

307
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:43,500
Picture Magic: Twin Storms
of Fire and Water!

308
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:47,000

He attacked both of
them with techniques

that they're weak against,
and at the exact same time!

315

[WALTER] The mightier his foes,
the greater his inspiration.

The young master's
creativity is infinite!

00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:27,833
[laughs] Don't take it too hard,
you've got a lot of potential,

320
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:31,000
but you're a little far away
from becoming a masterpiece!

Thanks a lot!

324
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:45,125
Not at all, sir! Um, that
spell was incredible, Captain.

325
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:47,083
I've never seen
anything like it.

[MAGIC KNIGHTS cheer]

331
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:08,875
Now that was an
interesting battle!

332
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:11,375
Eh. Just as I thought.

333
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,666
I'm relieved we made it
through the first round.

334
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,166
Guess so.

335
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:21,166
By the way, do you have any
idea what he's doing there?

336
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,583
Huh?

337
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:26,666
I could have gone with a
rougher hand on that side.

338
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:31,000
Oh, but that shade of cobalt
blue came out really pretty!

339
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:34,083
Hm, it's not quite perfect yet.

340
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:35,291
[BOTH]
Captain?

341
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,583
Shouldn't you be focused
on the tournament?

00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:39,583
[RILL]
Hm...

343
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:41,875
[NILS, RUBEN] We'll have to
really be on our toes.

344
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:44,416
I see the young master's
letting his mind wander

345
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,250
to ensure his teammates
are giving it their best!

346
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:49,708
He truly is a talented leader!

That makes no sense!

348

Oh. It would appear
it's our turn.

Hm...

00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,375
Captain Rill, let's go back.

Wait. What are you doing?

361
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:19,125
Stop, I need to look
at my art some more!

362
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:21,500
Let me go!

363

Hey, what's up? Is it over yet?

Yep! And you're up next!

This contest will
decide your eligibility

for the Royal Knights.

372

So please take it seriously!

00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:44,125
I'll be the leader.

No going solo,
do you understand me?

375

[LUCK] Aw, don't suck
all the fun out of it!

376
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:50,750
Listen here, you little ruffian.

had better not...

are my teammates?

A restless brat and
a fussy four-eyes.

I smell trouble!

to carry this team on my own!

[PULI]
Hm.

383
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:08,041
Well, I see no point in
getting mad about it now!

Let's crush that
crystal! You ready?

[KLAUS] Great, she's just as
carefree about this as he is!

394
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:33,166
In that case...

395
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,541
I'll have to work as
hard as possible.

396

We're rootin' for ya, Specs!

397

Good luck out there.
I know you can do it!

398

If you lose this, I'm never
calling you "sir" again.

Disrespectful as
always, aren't you?

400
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:48,000
Just wait and see;
you won't be disappointed.

401
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:50,250
[LUCK] Hey, we should
come up with a plan first.

402

Good thinking.

403
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,750
If there's one opponent
we need to be careful of...

404

...it's the Wind mage who's said
to be the swiftest in his squad.

It isn't what I wanted
to paint at all!

417
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,250
It should be more.

standing right here, do you not?

Something beautiful.
