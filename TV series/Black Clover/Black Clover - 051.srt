1
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,666
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,750
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,541
[NARRATOR] All seemed
lost until a lone mage

4
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:27,125
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:35,625
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:39,708
as the Wizard King, and
his story became legend.

7
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:15,083
[JULIUS] There was one
more piece of information

8
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:16,791
the Midnight Sun
members revealed

9
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:18,291
during their questioning.

10
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:19,791
Asta.

11
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:21,583
Remember the hideout
they took you to

12
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:23,000
after you were captured?

13
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:26,708
And the mysterious stone tablet
that was hidden there?

14
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:28,166
[ASTA]
That thing?

15
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,375
[JULIUS] According to our
captives, they call the gems

16
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:33,291
embedded in that tablet
"magic stones."

17
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:35,333
They believe that gathering
them will allow them

18
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:38,541
to be reborn into their
"true forms" with close ties

19
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:42,750
to the mana, thereby
granting them immense power.

20
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:44,833
Four stones remain
to be gathered.

21
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:47,000
And from what our captives
said, it seems they know

22
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,458
the location of one of them.

23
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:51,250
[YAMI]
Hm. Where's that?

24
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:52,875
[JULIUS]
The Underwater Temple,

25
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:55,666
one of the "strong
magic regions."

26
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,500
So, we have to get
there before this

27
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:59,375
Eye of the Midnight Sun
does and make off

28
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:02,833
with this magic stone thingy,
is that the general idea?

29
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:05,000
That's right, and I
believe the best people

30
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:07,375
for this mission will be
found in the Black Bulls,

31
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:09,125
who are unique among
the Magic Knights

32
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:11,250
because of the number of
its members unfettered

33
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:14,041
by family or social standing.

34
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:16,375
So, will you do it?

35
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,791
[YAMI] Looks like you didn't
make it to the main dish.

36
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,750
Rest in peace.

37
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,291
[GIFSO]
For saving the Underwater Temple

38

and its people,
you have my gratitude!

Thank you! Thank you so much!

40
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,541
All right, got it.

41
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:40,083
And now our mission's complete.

42
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:41,916
Listen up, gang.

43
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:45,000
[YAMI]
Nice work.

[BLACK BULLS gasp]

45
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,625
[NARRATOR] Having been
assigned a crucial mission

46
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:52,625
by the Wizard King, the Black
Bulls won a fierce battle

47
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:56,125
against a terrible foe,
secured the magic stone,

48
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:58,083
and returned home
with all members

[ASTA] You did such a
great job, everybody!

You're the one who wound up
the most seriously injured.

[FINRAL]
So exhausted.

Hello, my angel.

54
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,708
Your big brother has
completed his mission

55
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:13,208
and returned to dry land.

56
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:15,375
I feel so much better just
knowing we're breathing

57
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:16,291
the same air again.

58

[CHARMY]
Nom, nom, nom...

59
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,541
All that seafood was delicious,

60
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,750
but I've got an extra
stomach just for meat!

61
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:23,958
Ah! There's nothing
more satisfying

62
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:27,208
than the first bottle or three
after finishing a big job.

63
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:29,291
Completing an important
mission like this is a win

64
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:30,625
for the whole squad!

65
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,791
Something this big should
improve our standing.

66
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:34,291
Well, what do you know, guys.

67
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,708
Guess it turns out we're not
utterly hopeless after all!

68
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:39,125
True, we've gotten better,
but considering our record,

69
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:42,083
we're still dead last out of
all the Magic Knight squads.

forgot about Gordon.

Welcome back. I missed you...

[GAUCHE]
Hey, somebody talk to him.

00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:55,833
He looks kind of depressed.

00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:57,916
[MAGNA]
Naw, he's ticked off.

Just listen to the
way he's mumbling.

79
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:03,541
I'm not so sure. Isn't Gordon
always mumbling? Huh...

00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:05,541
It's creepy never
having any idea

what's going through his head.

[mumbling] I even bought
sunscreen and a parasol

for us to share, but
you just left me here!

I wanted to join forces

at the Underwater Temple,
using the power of friendship

--Whee!
--[JULIUS] Wow, Yami,

161
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,250
[JULIUS]
I didn't know you had a child.

162
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:00,416
Look how big she is, though.
When did this happen?

163
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,666
[YAMI]
Whoa. Not mine.

164
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,458
Hey, mister, do you have
any yummy treats for me?

165
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:04,666
[YAMI]
Look. Just drop it.

166
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,875
[CHARMY yelps]

167
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:06,958
Whew! Safe!

168
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:10,250
Here ya go: one
magic stone, as ordered.

169
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:11,541
[JULIUS]
Hm.

170
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:14,291
Thank you for this.

171
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:17,000
I know it wasn't
easy to procure.

172
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:18,708
You've probably heard,

173
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:20,958
but there were many casualties
among the Magic Knights

174
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:22,583
who fought in Raquey.

175
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:26,375
[JULIUS]
Now they can rest in peace.

176
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,208
You did receive your
share of injuries,

177
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:30,458
but the Black Bulls completed
this critical mission

178
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:32,625
without losing a single member.

179
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,916
That's nothing short
of marvelous.

180
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:37,833
[JULIUS]
And somewhere along the line,

181
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:40,291
you grew stronger, yourself.

182
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:41,916
Yami.

183
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:46,666
[ASSEMBLY MEMBER 51A]
I understand you've made

184
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,791
that foreigner a Magic Knight.

185
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:50,000
[ASSEMBLY MEMBER 51B]
Honestly. What is

186
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:51,791
Captain Julius thinking?

187
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,625
[ASSEMBLY MEMBER 51C]
Making someone like him

188
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,583
a Magic Knight captain?

189
00:08:57,666 --> 00:09:00,083
[ASSEMBLY MEMBER 51D]
Has the Wizard King gone mad?

190
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,208
[YAMI] You're kinda weird,
aren'tcha, mister?

191
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:10,375
You've done well.

192
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:12,750
I'm so proud of the amazing
Magic Knight captain

193
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,958
you've become. Truly.

194
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,750
I'm 28, not 12,
so cut it out, will ya?

195
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:20,416
You're embarrassing me.

196
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,000
Yes, of course.
Sorry about that.

197
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:27,041
Tell me if you remember
this little quote.

198
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:28,208
"If you wanna say you're right,

things your way."

200
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:34,875
Well, Julius? Those
were your words.

201
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,791
Just like I told
you before we left,

202
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:40,958
I accepted that mission to
prove that you weren't wrong.

203
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:43,375
That you hadn't
made any mistakes.

204
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,208
The way they fought
against that monster

205
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:47,916
back in the Underwater Temple...

206
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,291
[yelps]

207
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:52,500
My squad members proved
that I wasn't wrong, either.

208
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,416
Yes.

209
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:02,625
And, Asta, you've had another
impressive showing, young man.

210
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:05,708
You're doing well.
Very well, in fact.

211
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:10,083
[JULIUS] I expect we'll
see a lot more from you.

212
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:11,291
Thank you, sir!

213
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:13,208
Um, there was something
I was wondering.

214
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,375
I know you're super busy and
I don't wanna bother you,

215
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,083
but I was hoping that, maybe...

216
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:18,250
Of course, what is it?

217
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,166
Well, if it isn't
too much trouble.

218
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:23,625
Sir. Could I have
your autograph please?

219

[YAMI] Tell you what, you can
have mine. On your face.

220
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,291
I'll pass! Thank you!

221
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:29,708
Be nervous around me for once.

00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,416
I am! I am!

223

Please forgive
the intrusion, sir,

224
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,958
but it's important!

00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:36,125
Hey, Mushroomhead.

226
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:37,875
I've told you before, it's--

227
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:40,375
You know what, never mind.
Now's not the time for this.

228
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:42,125
Go on, Marx, what is it?

229
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,291
It's Kiten, the border village
and site of frequent

230
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:46,208
skirmishes with
the Diamond Kingdom.

231
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:48,625
A Diamond unit is
attacking it as we speak!

[CHARMY, YAMI, ASTA gasp]

233
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:52,291
Of course, they
had to strike now.

234
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:59,166
So many.

Whoa! That looks like
a whole army of 'em!

237
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:24,666
This is a far cry from
our usual skirmishing.

238
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,125
Especially when
you consider those

239
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:27,666
who appear to be in command.

Yes: Lagus, Brocks, and Yagos.

Eight Shining Generals.

00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,000
I've never heard of them before!

244
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:39,916
They're the eight
most powerful people

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,041
in the whole Diamond Kingdom.

[BOTH yelp]

247
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,833
[YAMI] You might think of
them as being kinda like

248
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:47,041
our Magic Knight captains.

249
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:49,541
[ASTA]
That's super not good.

250
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:53,000
[MARX] Worse, Kiten is the
linchpin of our border defense.

251
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:54,541
If we lose it,
we'll be wide open

252
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:56,833
to a Diamond Kingdom invasion.

253
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,541
[LAGUS]
The time has come.

254
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:02,125
This battle could
alter the course

255
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:04,166
of the Diamond
Kingdom's history.

256
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:07,916
[cackles] A big battle.
It's been far too long.

257
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,458
How very exciting.

258
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:13,166
[BROCKS laughs] We'll crush
these Clover Kingdom weaklings

259
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,416
and take their
precious border town.

260

The little maggots
don't stand a chance.

261
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:20,166
Our spies informed us
that the Clover Kingdom

262
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,416
had been worn down by
their continued conflict

263
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,958
with the Eye of
the Midnight Sun,

264
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:26,500
and that border security was
thin on the ground as a result.

265
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:28,041
It seems they were correct.

266
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:30,000
We just need to take
control of Kiten

267
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,916
and then we'll have
the upper hand.

This area has a wealth
of resources, too.

[ASTA]
Do you remember that vow we made

475
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:11,208
when we were kids?

476
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:13,916
That we were gonna fight to see
who will become the Wizard King?

477
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,416
Oh, that vow? It was ages ago.

478
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,791
I'd totally forgotten.

479
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:20,333
Right, quit trying
to play it cool.

480
00:23:20,416 --> 00:23:22,416
So, what are you up
to tomorrow anyway?

481
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,500
You gotta work?

482
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:24,833
Tomorrow?

483
00:23:24,916 --> 00:23:27,375
That's too far in the
future to say for sure.

484
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:30,291
Seriously, quit tryin'
to play it cool, Yuno!

485
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:33,500
Hold on! "Yuno"?
Is that really my name?

486
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:34,625
But I don't know anything.

487
00:23:34,708 --> 00:23:36,750
It's all a blank!
What happened to me?

488
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:38,666
You mean you're not
just playing it cool?

489
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,250
What's wrong, Yuno?!

490
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:41,750
[BOTH] We'll see you
again soon for more

fun-filled episodes
of <i>Black Clover</i> !

492
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:48,541
[VANESSA] The Diamond
Kingdom's attacking us,

493
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:51,208
and the Golden Dawn's been
deployed to fight them?

494
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:53,208
Oh, well, just let
them handle it, then.

495
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:55,291

No problem. [hiccups]
