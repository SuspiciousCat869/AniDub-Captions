00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:15,750
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:15,833 --> 00:00:18,625
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:24,375
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:27,083
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:35,583
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:39,791
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

[NARRATOR]
The Royal Knights Selection Exam

8

is now five matches in.

00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:48,458
[EMCEE MAGE] The crystal's
magic has been cut off!

10
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:50,125
Team B's the winner!

11
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:54,916
[BOTH]
Ready! Full bloom!

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,291
[EMCEE MAGE]
Team C wins!

[LEOPOLD]
Flame Magic: Spiral Flames!

[EMCEE MAGE]
Crystal destroyed! Team E wins!

15

[LANGRIS]
Heh, heh.

Crystal destroyed! Team I wins!

21
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:33,291
[chuckles] Don't
take it too hard.

22
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:35,333
You've got a lot of potential,

23
00:01:35,416 --> 00:01:38,458
but you're a little far away
from becoming a masterpiece!

24
00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:40,125

It's finally our turn!

27
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:45,583
[KLAUS]
I'll be the leader.

28
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:48,291
No going solo,
do you understand me?

29
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:49,708
[PULI]
We'll give them a performance

30
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:51,708
they'll never forget!

31
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:53,083
Yeah!

32
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:55,500
[EMCEE MAGE] And with that,
it's time for match six!

33
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:57,791
The battle begins now!

34
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:37,166
The competition
sure is heating up.

35
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,750
Most teams have been cautious,
but not these two.

36
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:42,208
They're out in the middle,
attacking directly!

37
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:48,291
[yells] Steel Creation Magic:
Full Metal Fortress!

38
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:59,208
Whoa, did you notice the
crazy shape of that spell?

39
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:00,583
That was awesome!

40
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:02,833
That runt's added some
pages to his grimoire

41
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:05,125
and given his power an upgrade!

42
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:08,625
[LUCK] Lightning Magic:
Thunderbolt Destruction!

43

[MAGIC KNIGHTS]

44
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:12,333
That team's got
a strong offense!

45
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,875
Yeah. They're good!

46
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:16,041
And they're only at
a Junior level, too!

47
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,708
Me and Luck have been
crankin' out the missions

48
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,333
like crazy over
the past few months,

49
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:22,083
and every one of em' has made us
that much more powerful!

50
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:24,208
So obviously, bein' Junior
rank doesn't mean

51
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,083
a damn thing to us!

52
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:29,083
[KLAUS] They always did have
Intermediate-level talent.

53
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:32,958
And now I see they've
continued to improve.

54
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:34,958
But I've grown as well!

55
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,416
Inspired by Asta,
I've trained my magic,

56
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,250
my muscles, and my mind!

57
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,458
[laughing]

58
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:44,500
[KLAUS] And my hard
work may betray me...

59
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:47,500
...but I won't betray
my hard work!

[WINSTON yells]

62
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,916
There ya go, Specs,
that's the kind of

63
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,833
epic beatdown I'm talkin' about!

64
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:57,708
Wow, Klaus, I'm so proud of you!

65
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:58,875
I suppose you might be more

66
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:01,625
than a bespectacled
worrywart after all!

67
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:04,458
That was pretty cool!
After the tournament's over,

68
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:06,041
--would you wanna spar with me?
--[KLAUS groans]

69
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:10,166
Stop being an incorrigible child
and focus on the battle at hand!

70
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,541
[KLAUS]
That's him. Rob Vitesse.

71
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:23,458
He's turned his back
on their crystal.

72
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:25,208
We should attack all
three of them head-on

73
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,333
and obliterate their
crystal in one blow!

74
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:28,750
You got it!

75
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:30,125
Well, look at that!

76
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:34,875
Turns out you silly boys
aren't half bad! Gotcha!

Whoa, that lady can fly?

00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:42,208
[PULI] Angel Flapping
oughta do the trick!

80
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,750
An offensive strike.

81
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,833
[KLAUS]
Go for it!

82
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:49,541
[PULI]
And a tailwind for my teammates!

83
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,875
[LUCK]
Oh, boy, this is a lot of fun!

84
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:54,000
Now, Luck! Break it!

85
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,541
The difference in our
strengths will determine

86
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:01,083
which of us will
emerge victorious.

87
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:03,791
We threw all that magic at him

88
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:06,875
and the guy didn't
budge an inch! No good.

89
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:09,583
All right, ya crazy
kid, have at him!

90
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:10,750
[LUCK]
More.

He's fast!

Come on. Let's fight some more!

showed him, huh?

00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:31,625
[whispering] Yay!

101
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:37,125
Woo-hoo! That was such a blast!

102
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:39,625
Oh, Luck, I can't believe
I underestimated you;

103
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:41,166
that was astounding!

104
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,833
Ding-ding ladies and
gents, we have a winner!

105

You did it, Luck!

108
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:52,500
That sneaky little rascal.
Dammit. I think he's too strong!

[BOTH]
Next I'll be fighting him.

112
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,250
Bet that'll be interesting.

113
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:03,166
I'll paint an even
prettier picture!

114
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,708
[EMCEE MAGE] Now for the
eighth and final match

115
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:05,916
of the first round!

116
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,291
Teams O and P, approach!

117
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:10,916
The last one. And it's
a real doozy, too!

118
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,416
I can't wait!

119
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,541
[ASTA] It's gonna be Yuno and
Noelle on a team together!

120
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,250
Sheesh, that took long enough!

121
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:20,166
When all this is over with,
you owe me a date!

122
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,625
I don't think so.

123
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,958
[ASTA]
Who's their third?

124
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:26,250
Hey, gang. Are you ready?

125
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:27,958
If we all do our
best, we're sure

126
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:29,166
to make it through this round!

127
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,500
[ASTA] Can you make it
through this day?

128
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,416
I just know we're gonna succeed.

129
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,958
Do you think this guy
is okay to participate?

130
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,333
I don't know.

131
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,000
Actually, now that
I think about it,

132
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:42,125
didn't you and Asta
grow up together?

133
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:45,041
You'd better not act like an
idiot out there like he would.

134
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:46,625
Same goes for you.

135
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:49,875
I know magic control
isn't your strong suit.

136
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:51,750
You had your hands
full using Mana Skin

137
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:55,708
back at the volcano.
Are you up for this?

138
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:57,083
Excuse me?

139
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:59,000
Don't you realize you're
in the presence of royalty?

140
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:00,333
I mean, let's be honest,
you were raised

141
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,750
to be a barbarian
just like Asta was.

142
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:05,500
Maybe you're too stupid
to participate in this test!

143
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,000
[BELL]
Keep it down, princess.

144
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,583
Not only is that
a weak argument,

145
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:10,541
but how you phrased
it was childish.

146
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:11,583
It kind of makes me wonder

147
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,250
if Asta's been
rubbing off on you.

148
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:14,500
How dare you!

149
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:16,083
If you're saying I would
let myself be influenced

150
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:17,916
by a mediocre
musclehead like Asta,

151
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,916
then you're just as much
of an ignorant jerk as he is.

152
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,125
And stop looking...

153
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:23,125
[YUNO] You're clearly
riled up. I'll stop.

154
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:24,708
...the only one who's allowed
to do that to people.

155
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:25,875
Do you understand me?!

156
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:27,125
Now, now.

157
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,041
You guys aren't being
very good sports here!

158
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:31,000
Don't you think you
oughta try to play nice?

159
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,875
I'm pretty sure you're the
reason they're arguing, Asta.

160
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:36,291
Yeah right, who would bother
getting angry over you?

161
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:37,500
Owie!

162
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,125
[EN]
That's enough, you two.

163
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,750
Let's develop a plan.

164
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:44,625
I'm sorry, did I say
you could touch me?

165
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:45,666
[SOLID]
You must be confident

166
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,750
if you've got time
for chit-chat.

167
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:51,125
I'm shocked to find that
the shame of House Silva

168
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:52,958
is competing in this tournament.

169
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,708
The Black Bulls may
have recently ascended

170
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:57,083
to just above absolute
failure, but you don't

171
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:59,583
consider yourself responsible
for that, right?

172
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,416
Can we please not do this?

173
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,958
[SOLID] I'm not surprised
you haven't learned

174
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:04,958
to control your magic power.

175
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:06,791
After all, you couldn't
even get accepted

176
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:09,250
into the Silver Eagles,
despite the fact that you were

177
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,958
a member of the Silva family!

178
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:15,791
The jerk with the goofy
haircut again, seriously?

179
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,875
[SOLID laughing]

180
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,666
[SOLID]
What a waste of space!

181
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,250
If you're royalty,
then how come you can't

182
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,583
do all the amazing things
the rest of our family can,

183
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:25,041
you little freak?

184
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:28,125
That's odd! I thought
I trained you better

185
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:30,583
than to start eating
before I do!

186
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:34,625
[NOELLE grunting]

187
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,916
Please give me my toy back
before you mess it up.

188
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,500
I don't like this game!

189
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:39,750
If you weren't such a weakling,

190
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:41,291
then maybe you'd have
the ability to protect

191
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,458
all the things that
are important to you.

192
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,750
Just give it back, okay?

193
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,833
[fabric rips]

194
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:54,875
[SOLID] If it makes you angry,
then do something about it.

195
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:56,750
Oh, wait, your dumb
spells probably

196
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,875
can't hit me, can they?

197
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:06,916
Oh, great, that thieving
raccoon is after Yuno again!

198
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,208
Ow, it's so sparkly!

199
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:10,875
My eyeballs are killing me!

200
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,541
[mumbling] It's okay.
You can do it, Noelle.

201
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:13,958
Look at how much
you've accomplished

202
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:16,083
since you started your
journey with the Black Bulls.

203
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:17,041
We're cheering for you.

204
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,250
We know what you're capable of,

205
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:19,666
way better than your
foolish brother does.

206
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,250
You know what they say,
friends are the family

207
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:22,666
you choose, and you chose us!

208
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,041
So, if you can't
believe in yourself,

209
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:26,333
then just believe in the
friends who believe in you!

210
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,875
Does anybody know what he's
mumbling about over there?

211
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:31,291
I'd say he's putting
some kind of unspeakable

212
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:32,916
curse on that Silver Eagles guy.

213
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,666
I think you've
wasted enough time.

214
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,791
It's our turn to fight.

215
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:38,166
Oh, well, I beg your pardon.

216
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,000
I hope you're ready, Noelle.

217
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:41,791
Watch out. Don't die.

218
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:42,791
[CHARMY]
That's it!

219
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,416
As soon as I get
my eyesight back,

220
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,708
it's over for you, bug!

221

[EMCEE MAGE] And now,
the eighth match of round one.

222
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:06,125
Team O: Alecdora,
Solid, and Dmitri,

223
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:09,250
vs. Team P:
En, Yuno, and Noelle.

224
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:10,458
Let's begin!

225
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:12,166
With Noelle and Yuno
on the same team,

226
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,625
I know who's gonna win!

227
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:14,875
Y-U-N-O!

228
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:16,041
We're rooting for you.

229
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,708
Show these boys
the Beautiful Babes

00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:19,458
of the Black Bulls
mean business!

231
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,166
Remember not to go easy on him

232
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,958
just because he's
your big brother.

233
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:24,458
All the more reason to beat him!

234
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:26,041
I'll do the attacking.

235
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:27,458
You two can back me up.

236
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:28,958
No, that should be my job.

237
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:29,833
It's fine.

238
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:30,833
Let me do it!

239
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:31,833
No thanks.

240
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:33,000
Listen here!

241
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:35,833
I'll be happy on the
defensive, actually.

242
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:38,625
[YUNO gasps] They're a lot
faster than I thought.

243
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:40,708
Huh? What's happening?

244
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:47,500
[SOLID] Vexing as it is to do,
this abridged version

245
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:50,875
of that Compound magic
is a handy shortcut!

246
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:54,541
A single swift attack
and it's all over!

247
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:57,791
Their team's crystal is still
in its starting location.

248
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:02,416
Damn! They're about to shatter
ours in one fell swoop!

249
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:06,250
Wind Magic:
Crescent Moon Sickle!

250
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:09,458
Flame Magic: Combo Eruption!

251
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:12,458
Water Magic: Sea Dragon's Lair!

252
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:16,791
So the little neophyte
thinks she can learn

253
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,958
defensive spells, does she?

254
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:22,458
Sand Magic:
Suppressing Sand Mass!

255
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:26,041
[NOELLE gasps]

256
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:28,416
[NOELLE]
It's absorbing all the water!

[NOELLE]

258
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:34,666
If this keeps up, we'll be
stuck on the defensive.

259
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,916
Listen, girl! This is
not an opportunity

260
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,541
to cozy up to my Yuno! 'Kay?

261
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:40,625
Here's the plan.

262
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:43,083
I'm probably the
fastest on the team.

263
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:44,708
So I'm going to try
to catch them off guard

264
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:46,791
and destroy their crystal.

265
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:48,125
You and that other
guy should focus

266
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:50,958
on protecting ours.

00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,416
I'll stop you right here!

272

That's the stuff, Noelle!

273
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:14,166
[YUNO] She's fought alongside
Asta. She'll be fine.

274
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:20,125
[YUNO] Besides, the crystal's
safer with me guarding it.

If it's me who goes...

to be right on my heels!

[MAGIC KNIGHT 77B]
In his first year?

Now that's what
I call impressive!

[MAGIC KNIGHT 77A]
Oh, and it gets better.

287
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:54,625
After that, he took a shot
at the vice captain

288
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:57,416
and said he'd be the captain
of the Golden Dawn!

being chosen by the Wind Spirit

doesn't it?

292
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:03,833
[MAGIC KNIGHT 77A]
Seems like Captain Vangeance

00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:06,541
has high hopes for him.

294
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:08,666
[ALECDORA] So you think you
can eliminate me and protect

at the same time?

There's that arrogance
you're so famous for!

Just fight like you
mean it, okay?

[ALECDORA grunting]

00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:32,500
[ALECDORA] I should've
been ready for an ambush.

301
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:36,666
I managed to escape, but I
wound up in this deep cave.

00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:41,583
Not much chance of
someone coming to save me.

So this is it.

There's no need to fear.
I'll help you.

305
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:53,916
[ALECDORA] In that moment,
he reminded me of a painting

from my childhood of

[ALECDORA]
Besides his magic,

00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:16,833
Captain Vangeance has
another strange power.

312
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,166
It's some kind of warmth
that connects him

313
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:22,666
to all of us squad members.

314
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,375
After that happened,
I swore that I'd dedicate

00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,708
my grimoire to him.

316
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:29,875
I strove to help
the Golden Dawn remain

00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:34,708
the greatest of all
the Magic Knight squads.

318
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:36,875
Because we are the noble elite

319
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:41,500
hand-selected by
Sir Vangeance himself!

320
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:44,208
So why was he made one of us?

321
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:47,458
This backwoods commoner.

322
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:49,750
And what's more,

323
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:52,666
even though he bonded with
each of us impartially.

324
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:56,208
It's plain to see that the
captain favors him the most!

325
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:59,375
But why? I don't understand!

326
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,041
Yuno.

327
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:04,000
Why has he said
that lowlife's name

328
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:06,666
five times today?

329
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:10,458
And he hasn't spoken
the first word to me!

330
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:12,416
What makes him special?

331
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,458
The four-leaf clover?

332
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:16,541
It's bad enough that
he's regarded so highly

333
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,250
above the rest of us.

334
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:20,125
But for that urchin to
declare that he'll become

335
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:22,666
the next captain
of the Golden Dawn?

336
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:25,000
It's an insult to Sir Vangeance!

In fact, my siblings are the
reason I'm fighting today.

Noelle, an older brother's
