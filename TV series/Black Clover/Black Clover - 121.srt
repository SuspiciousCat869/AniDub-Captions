1
00:00:23,638 --> 00:00:25,765
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:25,849 --> 00:00:28,476
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:30,437 --> 00:00:33,481
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost until
a lone mage stepped forward

4
00:00:33,565 --> 00:00:36,234
and took up the fight.

5
00:00:36,317 --> 00:00:40,447
The hero's name was
Lumiere Silvamillion Clover.

6
00:00:42,407 --> 00:00:45,410
[NARRATOR] He was later hailed
as the First Wizard King,

7
00:00:45,493 --> 00:00:48,163
and his story became legend.

8
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,044
[JULIUS]
Hey there! Guess I survived!

9
00:00:54,127 --> 00:00:56,338
Though, as you can see,
I'm a bit smaller now.

10
00:00:56,421 --> 00:00:58,673
--[BOTH gasping]
--[JULIUS chuckles]

11
00:01:00,467 --> 00:01:05,096
Yami. I'm leaving
the rest to you now.

12
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:09,017
Okay, hold on. What kind of
wacky plot twist is this?

13
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,436
You gave a fancy final
speech and everything.

14
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:13,313
Why aren't you dead?

15
00:01:13,396 --> 00:01:15,440
Thinking you were
dead inspired me.

16
00:01:15,523 --> 00:01:17,650
Now I feel like
I wasted my energy.

17
00:01:17,734 --> 00:01:19,486
Please relax, Yami.

18
00:01:19,569 --> 00:01:21,696
I'm sorry for being useless
while the Clover Kingdom

19
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,990
was in such awful peril.

20
00:01:24,074 --> 00:01:27,869
I was expecting my magic to kick
in sooner, but no such luck.

21
00:01:27,952 --> 00:01:29,204
Oh, yeah?

22
00:01:30,038 --> 00:01:31,539
[JULIUS]
That's right.

23
00:01:31,623 --> 00:01:35,960
I had previously stored about 13
years of time into a magic item.

24
00:01:36,044 --> 00:01:37,253
I had to take a gamble though

25
00:01:37,337 --> 00:01:39,381
on whether or not
it would activate.

26
00:01:40,423 --> 00:01:45,804
[sighs] Damn it. You're
still as batty as ever.

27
00:01:45,887 --> 00:01:50,350
On the other hand, I thought I'd
never see your face again, so...

28
00:01:50,433 --> 00:01:52,769
Guess it isn't all bad.

29
00:01:52,852 --> 00:01:54,562
Please forgive me, Julius.

30
00:01:54,646 --> 00:01:57,941
What I did was foolish.

31
00:01:58,024 --> 00:02:00,151
William Vangeance.

32
00:02:00,235 --> 00:02:02,487
Regardless of what
your reason was,

33
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:05,365
betraying the kingdom
is a grave crime.

34
00:02:05,448 --> 00:02:08,118
Countless people have suffered,
and it will take some time

35
00:02:08,201 --> 00:02:10,078
for them to recover.

36
00:02:10,161 --> 00:02:11,413
While they're healing,

37
00:02:11,496 --> 00:02:13,665
I'm not going to
allow you to sit idly.

38
00:02:13,748 --> 00:02:14,958
[gasps]

39
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:16,501
Don't you think you're
going a little easy

40
00:02:16,584 --> 00:02:18,294
on Goldiguts there?

41
00:02:18,378 --> 00:02:20,338
He did a lot of damage.
The least you could do

42
00:02:20,422 --> 00:02:22,132
is punish him for it.

43
00:02:22,215 --> 00:02:24,009
Well, the way I see it,

44
00:02:24,092 --> 00:02:26,428
I was the one who invited him
to join the Magic Knights,

45
00:02:26,511 --> 00:02:28,221
and made him a captain,

46
00:02:28,304 --> 00:02:31,808
which means I'm
somewhat responsible.

47
00:02:31,891 --> 00:02:34,894
Not only that, but I
lost against the other soul

48
00:02:34,978 --> 00:02:36,604
that was possessing his body,

49
00:02:36,688 --> 00:02:40,316
the leader of the Eye
of the Midnight Sun.

50
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,444
I'm sure some will
resent you for your part

51
00:02:42,527 --> 00:02:44,779
in all of this, William.

52
00:02:44,863 --> 00:02:48,616
But, I know your own
suffering was also great.

53
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,869
The question is:
do you have the resolve

54
00:02:50,952 --> 00:02:54,080
to press on in spite of the
hatred you're sure to face?

55
00:02:54,164 --> 00:02:56,124
[WILLIAM gasps]

56
00:02:57,792 --> 00:03:00,462
I won't fail you again, Julius.

57
00:03:00,545 --> 00:03:02,547
If you'll have it...

58
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:06,051
...then my grimoire belongs
to you for the good

59
00:03:06,134 --> 00:03:08,720
of the Clover Kingdom.

60
00:03:08,803 --> 00:03:11,306
[YAMI]
For cryin' out loud, Julius.

61
00:03:11,389 --> 00:03:13,600
Apart from that baby face,
you haven't changed

62
00:03:13,683 --> 00:03:15,602
one bit, have you?

63
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,155
[JULIUS]
Now, then.

64
00:04:50,238 --> 00:04:52,574
I thank you all
for your hard work.

65
00:04:52,657 --> 00:04:55,827
The battle has ended, and we
can live happily ever after.

66
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:58,538
At least, that's what
I'd like to say.

67
00:04:58,621 --> 00:05:00,457
But unfortunately,
we're currently faced

68
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,500
with three problems.

69
00:05:02,584 --> 00:05:05,253
[NOELLE] Who does this guy
think he is, calling us here?

70
00:05:05,337 --> 00:05:07,422
He looks like
a snotty little kid.

71
00:05:07,505 --> 00:05:10,759
[MIMOSA] I could swear I've
sensed this mana before.

72
00:05:12,302 --> 00:05:13,261
Hang on.

73
00:05:13,345 --> 00:05:14,721
I know that ki!

74
00:05:14,804 --> 00:05:17,766
Yeah! I recognize him!

75
00:05:17,849 --> 00:05:19,809
Let me explain
problem number one.

76
00:05:19,893 --> 00:05:22,354
The Wizard King is
nowhere to be found.

77
00:05:22,437 --> 00:05:23,980
You're the Wizard King, genius,

78
00:05:24,064 --> 00:05:25,398
or did you forget already?

79
00:05:25,482 --> 00:05:27,942
--[GROUP yells]
--[ASTA] Aw, I knew it!

80
00:05:28,026 --> 00:05:31,571
Sadly, my magic is mostly
depleted at this point.

81
00:05:31,654 --> 00:05:33,531
My grimoire's just one page.

82
00:05:33,615 --> 00:05:35,492
So I'm unable to fight.

83
00:05:35,575 --> 00:05:38,536
Not only that, but I now have
significantly less influence

84
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,539
with the hard-line nobles whose
primary concern is the wealth

85
00:05:41,623 --> 00:05:43,792
and power of this kingdom.

86
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:45,877
Okay, can I ask
you one question?

87
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,297
Why are you still alive and
how did you get so tiny?

88
00:05:49,381 --> 00:05:52,217
[YAMI] That was two
questions, shortstack.

89
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,677
Ah, yes.

90
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,472
You see, one day, while I was
out wandering incognito,

91
00:05:57,555 --> 00:05:59,808
I discovered some magic
technology left behind

92
00:05:59,891 --> 00:06:01,810
by ancient mages.

93
00:06:01,893 --> 00:06:04,312
According to the documents
in the palace library,

94
00:06:04,396 --> 00:06:07,023
the device is
called Swallowtail.

95
00:06:07,107 --> 00:06:08,316
[gasps]

96
00:06:09,651 --> 00:06:11,486
[JULIUS] I soon realized
that my Time Magic

97
00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:13,947
and Swallowtail were
very compatible.

98
00:06:16,658 --> 00:06:18,785
That was when I began
stockpiling small amounts

99
00:06:18,868 --> 00:06:22,330
of magic and time inside
the emblem on my forehead.

100
00:06:22,414 --> 00:06:24,833
Just in case something terrible
were to happen to me,

101
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:27,711
I would have the ability
to start over again.

102
00:06:27,794 --> 00:06:29,045
[GROUP gasps]

103
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:30,922
[JULIUS]
However, I didn't get to restart

104
00:06:31,006 --> 00:06:32,382
from where I'd left off.

105
00:06:32,465 --> 00:06:35,093
I stored only enough
time to get me this age.

106
00:06:35,176 --> 00:06:37,429
Even the best-laid
plans, as they say.

107
00:06:37,512 --> 00:06:38,888
[laughs]

108
00:06:38,972 --> 00:06:40,807
I'd still call that a win.

109
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:43,935
Not everyone's lucky enough
to get a do-over in life.

110
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:48,106
Be glad, ya baby-faced grandpa.

111
00:06:48,189 --> 00:06:49,607
[LUMIERE]
Secré! We did it!

112
00:06:49,691 --> 00:06:52,694
We finally finished
our first prototype!

113
00:06:52,777 --> 00:06:54,821
[SECRÉ]
This puts us one step closer to

114
00:06:54,904 --> 00:06:57,741
the peaceful world
you want to create.

115
00:06:57,824 --> 00:06:59,409
It's all thanks to you.

116
00:06:59,492 --> 00:07:02,871
You seem to believe your type of
magic isn't good for anything,

117
00:07:02,954 --> 00:07:04,748
but that's just not true.

118
00:07:04,831 --> 00:07:06,332
[SECRÉ]
Prince.

119
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,460
[LUMIERE] Oh, and I've
already come up with a name

120
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:11,212
for our new magic item.

121
00:07:11,296 --> 00:07:13,465
But for now, it'll be a secret.

122
00:07:13,548 --> 00:07:15,383
Secré Swallowtail.

123
00:07:15,467 --> 00:07:16,593
[gasps]

124
00:07:18,345 --> 00:07:19,679
[SECRÉ]
Your Highness.

125
00:07:19,763 --> 00:07:22,807
Our creation has survived
for all these years,

126
00:07:22,891 --> 00:07:26,519
and now it's saved the life of a
person who carries your legacy.

127
00:07:26,603 --> 00:07:28,146
This whole thing
is weird and confusing,

128
00:07:28,229 --> 00:07:31,274
but I'm just happy to see you're
still alive, Wizard King!

129
00:07:31,358 --> 00:07:32,567
Thanks, Asta.

130
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,736
You're as energetic as ever.

131
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:37,072
I hear you did a great
job once again.

132
00:07:37,155 --> 00:07:38,865
I've got a long way to go, sir!

133
00:07:38,948 --> 00:07:41,242
But yeah, I gave it my best!

134
00:07:41,326 --> 00:07:43,078
[JULIUS]
As for Noelle and Mimosa:

135
00:07:43,161 --> 00:07:44,704
I can tell by the
growth of your mana

136
00:07:44,788 --> 00:07:47,457
that you courageously risked
your lives in this endeavor.

137
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,125
Well done, both of you.

138
00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:50,502
[BOTH]
Thank you!

139
00:07:50,585 --> 00:07:53,672
And lastly, to our guest
whom I don't recognize...

140
00:07:53,755 --> 00:07:55,340
Tell me about your magic!

141
00:07:55,423 --> 00:07:58,802
I spent so many years wandering
all over this land in disguise,

142
00:07:58,885 --> 00:08:01,596
and I've never even heard
of anything like your power!

143
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,931
Chill out.

144
00:08:03,014 --> 00:08:05,475
You still haven't finished
explaining everything.

145
00:08:05,558 --> 00:08:08,895
Now hurry up and fill us in so
we can go and help the others.

146
00:08:08,978 --> 00:08:11,564
[chuckles] Oh, right,
sorry about that.

147
00:08:11,648 --> 00:08:13,274
So, he hasn't
changed at all, then.

148
00:08:13,358 --> 00:08:14,776
Yeah, that's his default.

149
00:08:14,859 --> 00:08:16,945
Excitable as always.

150
00:08:17,028 --> 00:08:18,571
You plannin' to
tell us about problems

151
00:08:18,655 --> 00:08:20,532
two and three anytime soon?

152
00:08:20,615 --> 00:08:22,200
I'm doing my best
to keep them a secret

153
00:08:22,283 --> 00:08:25,995
for as long as possible,
but I will say this.

154
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:28,456
I fear that the Clover Kingdom
is going to be attacked

155
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,834
by the neighboring lands.

156
00:08:30,917 --> 00:08:32,168
You mean...

157
00:08:32,252 --> 00:08:33,837
The Diamond Kingdom, right?

158
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,463
Like before.

159
00:08:35,547 --> 00:08:38,091
Also, there's a possibility
that Asta will die.

00:08:38,174 --> 00:08:40,176
[GROUP]
What?!

161
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,594
Asta could die?

162
00:08:41,678 --> 00:08:43,555
[NOELLE]
Did I miss something here?

163
00:08:43,638 --> 00:08:45,890
Hang on, is this an
"either-or" situation or what,

164
00:08:45,974 --> 00:08:48,268
because both of those
things sound really bad!

165
00:08:48,351 --> 00:08:50,437
Actually, they could
both happen.

166
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,273
And his predictions
are usually spot-on.

167
00:08:53,356 --> 00:08:55,984
I'm glad I'm not you. Farewell.

168
00:08:56,067 --> 00:08:58,361
Don't start planning
my funeral yet!

169
00:08:58,445 --> 00:09:01,281
Could you back up and explain
this better, please?

170
00:09:01,364 --> 00:09:04,451
Asta, the dark power
that you've been using

171
00:09:04,534 --> 00:09:05,869
came from a devil.

172
00:09:05,952 --> 00:09:07,037
[gasping]

173
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,955
What? Is that true?

174
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:12,334
[ASTA] Like that creepy
guy we just fought?

175
00:09:12,417 --> 00:09:14,294
I mean, it does have
kinda the same feel

176
00:09:14,377 --> 00:09:16,671
whenever I use it, but...

177
00:09:16,755 --> 00:09:18,089
A devil?

178
00:09:18,173 --> 00:09:20,884
[NOELLE] Of course.
That other form of his.

179
00:09:20,967 --> 00:09:23,470
It is similar to the one our
grandmother told us about

180
00:09:23,553 --> 00:09:25,805
when we were little.

181
00:09:25,889 --> 00:09:28,183
Knowing that, I wonder
if it's too dangerous for you

182
00:09:28,266 --> 00:09:29,768
to use that power.

183
00:09:29,851 --> 00:09:32,020
What do you mean?
I'm totally fine!

184
00:09:32,103 --> 00:09:34,647
It's only a little
excruciating pain, that's all!

185
00:09:34,731 --> 00:09:37,817
Nothing about what you just
said sounds "fine" to me.

186
00:09:37,901 --> 00:09:39,194
A devil, huh?

187
00:09:39,277 --> 00:09:42,530
Ugh. Gross. Stay away.

188
00:09:42,614 --> 00:09:43,823
Whoa, Captain Yami!

189
00:09:43,907 --> 00:09:45,200
Did you mean that
the way it sounded?

190
00:09:45,283 --> 00:09:47,035
'Cause it was really hurtful!

191
00:09:47,118 --> 00:09:50,080
That horn is a symbol
of when humans ventured

192
00:09:50,163 --> 00:09:52,248
into another realm
and got themselves

193
00:09:52,332 --> 00:09:55,168
involved in a world
beyond our own.

194
00:09:55,251 --> 00:09:57,671
It's a curse known as weg.

195
00:09:57,754 --> 00:09:59,923
Apparently, there are other
Magic Knights who suffer

196
00:10:00,006 --> 00:10:01,758
from similar conditions.

197
00:10:03,385 --> 00:10:05,512
Wait, you mean
I'm not the only one?

198
00:10:05,595 --> 00:10:06,888
I'm confused.

199
00:10:06,971 --> 00:10:09,140
What realm are you
talking about, sir?

200
00:10:09,224 --> 00:10:11,184
I don't know all
of the details,

201
00:10:11,267 --> 00:10:13,770
but they say it's
where the devils reside.

202
00:10:13,853 --> 00:10:16,064
Indeed, and the
five-leaf grimoire

203
00:10:16,147 --> 00:10:18,525
that one devil failed
to get his hands on

204
00:10:18,608 --> 00:10:22,112
was eventually claimed
by another of his kind.

205
00:10:22,195 --> 00:10:23,571
Are you...?

206
00:10:23,655 --> 00:10:25,448
[JULIUS]
She has horns, as well.

207
00:10:25,532 --> 00:10:27,659
[SECRÉ]
Five hundred years back,

208
00:10:27,742 --> 00:10:30,745
I was cursed by forbidden
magic while sealing him.

209
00:10:33,206 --> 00:10:35,750
Then, the evil curse and my
own magic were mixed together,

210
00:10:35,834 --> 00:10:37,836
which caused this to happen.

211
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:41,172
I can change between my two
forms as often as I please now.

212
00:10:41,256 --> 00:10:42,298
[ASTA gasps]

213
00:10:42,382 --> 00:10:44,843
[NOELLE]
Nero's talking! That's so cute!

214
00:10:44,926 --> 00:10:46,261
How neat!

215
00:10:46,344 --> 00:10:48,388
This is entirely different
than Transformation Magic.

216
00:10:48,471 --> 00:10:51,891
You're sealing yourself into
the form of that tiny bird!

217
00:10:51,975 --> 00:10:54,269
To think the penalty
for using forbidden magic,

218
00:10:54,352 --> 00:10:55,812
combined with your
rare affinity,

219
00:10:55,895 --> 00:10:57,939
would produce a
result like this!

220
00:10:58,023 --> 00:11:00,442
Ancient magic is so fascinating!

221
00:11:00,525 --> 00:11:02,110
Can we get back to me?

222
00:11:02,193 --> 00:11:03,403
Tell me the truth.

223
00:11:03,486 --> 00:11:05,613
Am I seriously about to die?

224
00:11:05,697 --> 00:11:08,616
What if the devil explodes
and I end up in pieces?

225
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,036
[JULIUS]
Oh, right, sorry.

226
00:11:11,119 --> 00:11:13,413
As you may be aware,
the Clover Kingdom is surrounded

227
00:11:13,496 --> 00:11:16,249
by three other nations.

228
00:11:16,332 --> 00:11:18,168
The Diamond Kingdom
is aggressive.

229
00:11:18,251 --> 00:11:21,171
Thanks to their magic scholars,
their army is strong,

230
00:11:21,254 --> 00:11:23,965
and they're known to
experiment on humans.

231
00:11:24,049 --> 00:11:26,259
Then there's the
neutral kingdom of Heart.

232
00:11:26,343 --> 00:11:28,219
Their land is rich
with natural mana,

233
00:11:28,303 --> 00:11:30,430
so the people mostly
keep to themselves,

234
00:11:30,513 --> 00:11:33,516
focused on perfecting
their own unique magic.

235
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,560
The last is the Spade Kingdom,

236
00:11:35,643 --> 00:11:37,771
which is currently
vying for dominance.

237
00:11:37,854 --> 00:11:40,190
It's a frigid,
demonic landscape,

238
00:11:40,273 --> 00:11:43,068
served by the ancient
evils that sleep within.

239
00:11:43,151 --> 00:11:44,611
[GROUP gasps]

240
00:11:44,694 --> 00:11:46,029
They don't share
a border with us

241
00:11:46,112 --> 00:11:48,990
like the Diamond Kingdom does,
so Spade wants to extend

242
00:11:49,074 --> 00:11:52,619
its influence across the strong
magic region between us.

243
00:11:52,702 --> 00:11:55,080
But, due to recent events,
the Magic Knights who defend

244
00:11:55,163 --> 00:11:58,458
our land are more
exhausted than ever before.

245
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:00,085
[YAMI] Yeah, and let's not
forget about the ones

who got possessed and
switched sides on us.

247

The powers that be won't
take too kindly to that.

00:12:06,216 --> 00:12:08,593
And then there's
our wittle Wizard King.

Wait, that's not fair!

They can't help it if they were
taken over by the elves!

252
00:12:13,932 --> 00:12:15,975
It doesn't mean that
they can't be trusted!

[ASTA]
See?

00:12:22,774 --> 00:12:24,818
If we tell everyone that,
they'll understand!

00:12:24,901 --> 00:12:27,404
Then the Magic Knights
won't get in trouble!

259
00:12:27,487 --> 00:12:29,823
That's true,
but someone must pay,

260
00:12:29,906 --> 00:12:33,702
so the Magic Parliament will
likely blame your devil's power.

261
00:12:33,785 --> 00:12:36,204
They'll do everything
they can to find it guilty.

[ASTA gasps]

After all, you're
a commoner who can use

00:12:39,249 --> 00:12:42,127
a dark and mysterious power,
which makes you

for this ordeal.

Well, it's a group.

Ooh! Who had the nerve
to send you dogs here?!

[SEKKE] Well, that was
fun while it lasted.

You don't need to know.

Either way, the Eye
of the Midnight Sun

[KING CLOVER]
I don't know what's happening,

00:15:07,105 --> 00:15:08,690
but save me, Sekke!

What? Why did my weapon shrink?

329
00:15:24,289 --> 00:15:25,623
[DAMNATIO]
Shameful.

330
00:15:25,707 --> 00:15:28,585
It's so like you anti-monarchist
nobles to take advantage

331
00:15:28,668 --> 00:15:31,046
of a disaster to harm the king.

I can't move.

You're from House Kira!

[DAMNATIO]
Are you all right, my liege?

340
00:15:49,147 --> 00:15:51,483
I am far from
all right, Damnatio!

My royal robes are filthy!

[DAMNATIO]
Yes, my apologies.

00:15:55,945 --> 00:15:58,823
[DAMNATIO] Look at that.
It's finally appeared.

00:15:58,907 --> 00:16:00,408
Mark my words.

I'll condemn you for the sake of

[NARRATOR]
Several days later.

Nozel and Fuegoleon led
the effort to steadily rebuild

the royal capital after
it had been decimated by

I heard you were great in the

Oh, I suppose not.

I should've mentioned, I work
with the Magic Parliament.

[ASTA] Hey, that's what
the Wizard King told us about!

366
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:54,212
If you wouldn't mind,

367
00:16:54,295 --> 00:16:57,090
we'd like you to come
testify for us about the battle.

368
00:16:57,173 --> 00:16:59,092
So we can get the honest truth.

The honest truth?

00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:03,304
[MAGIC PARLIAMENT MEMBER 121A]
Yes, that's our job, after all.

Ah, the mysterious girl!

We'd be very interested in
your testimony as well, miss!

You can tell this
is a trap, right?

Don't worry, Noelle!

[ASTA]
Besides...

379
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,990
Someone needs to tell them
what happened with the devil

380
00:17:22,073 --> 00:17:25,076
and that whole
reincarnation thing.

that than us, right?

Okay, now that we're here,

I'm startin' to get
really nervous!

Remember what
the Wizard King said

00:17:40,175 --> 00:17:41,760
about your devil's power.

387

Don't let your guard down.

388
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:45,722
We got the elves
to listen to us.

As long as they let
us talk, it'll be fine.

Hold on, this isn't fair!

You can't just treat us
like we're criminals!

Looks like we fell
right into their trap.

Well, that's no surprise.

I always knew that raucous
little beast was up to no good.

[NOBLE 121E]
Look! She's got horns!

420
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,882
[DAMNATIO] The kingdom
has no record of her birth,

421
00:19:02,966 --> 00:19:06,720
and those horns indicate she
has dabbled in forbidden magic.

422
00:19:06,803 --> 00:19:07,929
[NOBLE 121F]
Forbidden magic?

She deserves to die!

[DAMNATIO] These two claim
that the recent disturbance

425
00:19:12,434 --> 00:19:15,395
was caused by a devil
who ensnared and controlled

426

a number of Magic Knights.

That's right!

The Magic Knights
only did all that stuff

429
00:19:20,316 --> 00:19:22,110
because a devil
was forcing them to!

They're the least respectable
of all the squads.

[NOBLE 121I]
She's got horns,

437
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:39,044
that means she sold her
soul to the devil.

[NOBLE 121J]
No doubt about it!

and yet these people
are still so hateful!

Even Asta's belief that we can
all understand each other

442

is fading now.

These nobles aren't used
to hearing from people

who are different than them.

Listen to me, would you?

I'm telling you the truth!

00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:01,399
[DAMNATIO] This trial will
end in one of two ways.

448
00:20:01,483 --> 00:20:04,110
Either you will be
convicted as a devil,

449
00:20:04,194 --> 00:20:06,112
or the Magic Knights
will be made to atone

450
00:20:06,196 --> 00:20:09,657
for the countless sins
they have committed.

451
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:12,744
And you clearly
can't abandon others.

452
00:20:12,827 --> 00:20:15,538
According to the scales,
you're simple-minded

453
00:20:15,622 --> 00:20:17,791
and therefore easily dealt with.

454
00:20:17,874 --> 00:20:22,087
A single commoner, or the Magic
Knights who protect our home.

455
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:25,256
It's obvious which way
the scales will tip.

456
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:28,885
Unless you can tell us
where this devil is now.

457
00:20:28,968 --> 00:20:32,472
He's gone! We defeated him.
I told you that!

458
00:20:32,555 --> 00:20:34,724
All because Nero worked hard
for a really long time

459
00:20:34,808 --> 00:20:36,101
to make it happen!

460
00:20:36,184 --> 00:20:38,395
Unfortunately, every person
in this room suspects

461
00:20:38,478 --> 00:20:40,355
that you and this girl
are the ones who've been

him about your power!

Well, if there isn't a devil,

judgment on everyone

00:21:05,463 --> 00:21:07,048
Marie?

472
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:10,093
[MARIE gasps]
Asta!

473
00:21:10,176 --> 00:21:11,928
[DAMNATIO]
This is Marie Adlai.

474
00:21:12,012 --> 00:21:14,806
Cast out from the House Adlai,
this ruined ex-noble

475
00:21:14,889 --> 00:21:17,308
now makes her home in
a church among orphans.

476
00:21:17,392 --> 00:21:20,812
Her older brother, Gauche,
is a former convict.

477
00:21:20,895 --> 00:21:22,022
We have confirmed that,

478
00:21:22,105 --> 00:21:24,399
during the recent
battle in question,

479
00:21:24,482 --> 00:21:28,236
her Eye Magic indirectly caused
great harm to Magic Knights

480
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:30,071
as well as some
of the citizenry.

481
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:31,656
You're making stuff up!

482
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,451
Marie didn't do any of those
bad things on purpose!

483
00:21:34,534 --> 00:21:35,910
Perhaps you're right.

484
00:21:35,994 --> 00:21:38,663
If a devil truly did play
a part in all this,

485
00:21:38,747 --> 00:21:41,124
I might believe the
girl was coerced.

486
00:21:41,207 --> 00:21:42,542
[gasps]

487
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:45,420
[DAMNATIO] However, if you
cannot provide any proof,

488
00:21:45,503 --> 00:21:48,840
all that remains is the
fact of her crimes.

489
00:21:48,923 --> 00:21:52,302
Therefore, she must
pay the price!

490
00:21:52,385 --> 00:21:54,095
Justice will be served!

491
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:55,347
[ASTA gasps]

492
00:21:57,599 --> 00:21:59,184
No, stop!

493
00:21:59,267 --> 00:22:01,519
Asta... Help me...

494
00:22:01,603 --> 00:22:03,646
[DAMNATIO]
I declare you...

495
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:05,065
...guilty!

496
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:09,110
[MARIE whimpers]

497
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:10,320
[AUDIENCE gasping]

498
00:22:10,403 --> 00:22:14,115
You don't have the right
to judge anybody!

499
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:15,742
What's he doing?

500
00:22:15,825 --> 00:22:17,160
You monster.

501
00:22:17,243 --> 00:22:20,038
You have no idea
what real justice is!

502
00:22:20,121 --> 00:22:22,707
I think this trial is over.

503
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:25,168
We don't reason with devils.

504
00:23:57,177 --> 00:23:59,679
[JULIUS] Damnatio is
an extremely stubborn person,

505
00:23:59,763 --> 00:24:02,891
so he probably won't let
Asta off the hook that easily.

"As Pitch Black as It Gets."

507
00:24:06,895 --> 00:24:08,396
Hey, I just thought
of the perfect idea

508
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,981
for how to save those two!
