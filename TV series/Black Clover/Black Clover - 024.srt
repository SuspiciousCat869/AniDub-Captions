1
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:15,666
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,666
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:24,666
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,291
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,750
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:39,916
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

[FUEGOLEON] Flame Creation
Magic: Leo Rugiens!

8
00:00:57,541 --> 00:01:00,583
[cackles] Aw, is that
all you've got?

9
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:04,125
I have to say, Captain,
I'm very disappointed in you.

10
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:09,541
[RADES gasps]

11
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:10,833
[ASTA gasps]

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,125
[FUEGOLEON] When you attacked,
the mana grew thin

13
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:19,291
in some places across the
barrier for the briefest moment.

14
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:21,916
Those were the spots
I aimed for.

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,625
[ASTA]
Man, he's awesome!

16
00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:27,666
[FUEGOLEON]
Listen to me, Rades.

17
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:32,458
You have incredible talent,
as well as powerful magic.

18
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:34,291
But wielded without
a just spirit,

19
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:36,875
they are no more than savagery.

20
00:01:36,958 --> 00:01:38,250
You're a monster.

21
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:40,333
They were right to
have expelled you!

22
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:42,291
[RADES gasps]

23
00:01:42,375 --> 00:01:45,000
[YUNO] I need to get
stronger so I can handle

24
00:01:45,083 --> 00:01:47,208
something like this more easily.

25
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:49,791
[CATHERINE] It's a bit early
to be celebrating.

26
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:54,416
The preparations must be
nearly complete by now.

27
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,000
Time for a feast.

28
00:01:56,083 --> 00:02:01,166
Such lively, young mana.
Absolutely, delicious.

29
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,125
[RADES]
What went wrong?

30
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:35,583
My power is great enough

31
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:39,000
to rival the strongest
mages in the kingdom.

32
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:44,625
[RADES] I've honed my magic,
studied the enemy,

33
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:47,416
made meticulous preparations.

34
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,375
Years of work, countless
hours of planning.

35
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:53,583
For this day. For this moment.

36
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:57,583
[RADES]
All wasted.

37
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:59,583
How did this happen?

38
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,750
[LEOPOLD yells]

39
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:21,208
Nice work. Thanks
for the shield.

40
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:23,958
Keep your thanks and
take care of him, already!

41
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:25,458
[LEOPOLD]
I'm on it!

42
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:31,416

[pants]

47
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,416
It's over!

48
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,333
That pile of ash won't
give us any trouble now.

49
00:04:58,416 --> 00:04:59,416
[laughs]

50
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,208
[groans]

51
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:03,000
Very well done, both of you!

52
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:06,083
You've shown your worth as
Magic Knights and as royalty.

53
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:07,958
[BOTH]
Sir!

54
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,291
What am I doing saluting him?

55
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:16,125
No. Impossible.

56
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:18,791
I'm stronger.

57
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:21,875
Royalty or not, nobody is
more powerful than I am!

58
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:23,750
You'll see!

59
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:27,333
Now, Flame Creation
Magic: Leo Palma.

60
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,291
Get these flames
off of me, damn you!

61
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:40,000
This isn't fair! It's
not over! I'll show you!

62
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:44,250
There are a great many
questions I would like to ask.

63
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:45,791
And you will answer.

64
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:48,458
But first, I'm going to take
a look at your grimoire.

65
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:51,125
[gasps] Wait, no!

66
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:54,541
[RADES]
That's mine! Don't touch it.

67
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:56,958
You have no right!

68
00:05:57,041 --> 00:06:00,000
Interesting. It seems
unusually thin.

69
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:02,166
No! Leave it alone!

70
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:08,625
Unbelievable. It only
has one page!

71
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:11,708
Quit looking! Put it down now!

72
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:13,291
--That's mine!
--[FUEGOLEON] One page...

73
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:16,833
Does this mean he can
only wield a single spell?

74
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:19,833
[RADES] Give it back!
Haven't you done enough?

75
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:21,791
I don't need your mockery, too!

76
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:24,958
[ASTA] Mockery? I don't
hear anyone laughing.

77
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:32,916
I get that you wanted people
to take you seriously.

78
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
But I don't understand why
you had to do it like this.

79
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:40,625
You're strong, and you've
got a ton of magic power.

80
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:44,583
But now, all that strength
and power mean nothing.

81
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:46,541
You threw them away!

82
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,541
Come here. But try not
to get me all dirty.

83
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,666
Thanks, I'll do my best.

84
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,416
Perhaps you could have
become a great man

85
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,291
if you had gone down
a different path.

86
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:06,250
This is where the lack of
a just heart has led you.

87
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:08,625
You must atone.

88
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:12,166
[VALTOS]
Well? Are you satisfied.

89
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,625
[ASTA]
A voice?

90
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:15,291
What is it? What's wrong?

91
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:17,833
[VALTOS] I hope you've
at least learned a lesson.

92
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:19,875
Clearly, your might
alone was not enough

93
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:21,000
to defeat a squad captain.

94
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:24,250
No. I almost won. Really.

95
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:27,916
[VALTOS]
Sometimes you cannot win,

96
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,250
no matter how great your power.

97
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,541
My power, too, nears its limit.

98
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:35,833
No more acting on your own.

99
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:38,833
From now on, we proceed
according to plan.

100
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,125
For the Master's sake.

101
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:46,541
[CITIZEN 24A] Three cheers
for the Magic Knights!

102
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:49,375
[CITIZEN 24B] I knew you
would save us, thank you!

103
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:50,625
Now, then.

104
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:53,416
I can practically hear
dessert calling my name.

105
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,625
Would you care to
come along? [giggles]

106
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:58,625
I'll pass, thank you.

107
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:07,166
A nice, hot bath sounds awesome
right about now, huh, Char?

108
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,583
Heavenly.

109
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:11,375
[CITIZEN 24C] Good job,
Blue Rose Knights! Thank you!

110
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:14,125
Captain Charlotte is
just so amazing!

111
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:16,375
Not to mention beautiful, too!

112
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,500
Sol is cooler, though.

113
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,416
[laughs]

114
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,375
[NOZEL] I have a feeling
this isn't over.

115
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:32,250
What do they want?

116
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,916
[sighs]

117
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:47,791
[VALTOS] Excellent. They're
all in the designated areas.

118
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,583
[gasps]

119

121
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,666
Magic?

122
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,333
[VALTOS] Allow me to
thank you for your service,

123
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,500
Magic Knights.

124
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:10,375
What the--

125
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:11,666
Look out!

126
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:29,875
[yelps] How?

127
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,500
Where did the Magic Knights go?

128
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:38,750
They disappeared
completely. But how?

129
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,291
Sol's gone!

130
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,875
[HAMON]
Oh, heavens. Where are we?

131
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:02,666
I would estimate that
we're at least a few

132
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,541
hundred kilometers from
the royal capital,

133
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:06,375
judging by the terrain here.

134
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:10,250
They sent us away?
That's not nice!

135
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:13,166
Our enemy has taken
things a step further.

136
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,458
I knew there was a
strong Spatial Magic user

137
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:17,583
working with them,
but even so...

138
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:18,875
To do this?

139
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:21,708
Transporting us all would
require great skill.

140
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:25,125
[ALECDORA]
We have failed!

141
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,833
Something's wrong.

142
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:29,958
Where'd the other
Magic Knights' mana go?

143
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:32,708
I don't know, but I
can't sense it either.

144
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:35,083
[FUEGOLEON]
I want to know how

145
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:36,666
you carried out this attack.

146
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,083
Where are the others
you're working with?

147
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:41,875
[RADES chuckles]

148
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:44,250
Um, does anyone know
what's happening?

149
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,416
Something is definitely wrong.

150
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,583
Those idiots fell for it
hook, line, and sinker.

151
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,250
It was almost too easy.

152
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,791
And these are the greatest
mages in the country?

153
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:03,208
How utterly pathetic.

154
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:05,041
I was going to play
with any of the Knights

155
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:09,208
who escaped, but I suppose
I won't get to now.

156
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:10,375
Oh, well.

157
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:12,083
This place is full
of young mana.

158

161
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:27,541
What is happening?

00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:31,166
[CITIZENS screaming]

163
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,583
[giggles] Much better.

164
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,250
Thanks to your
generous donations,

165
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,458
I can feel myself
growing younger already.

166
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:39,666
Who knew that skin
could be this smooth?

167
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,000
[CITIZENS panting, yelping]

168
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:43,041
No, please!

169
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:44,875
Just let us go!

170
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:47,166
You think you're so
sweet and cute, don't you?

171
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,166
Well, you're not. Sow!

172
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,666
[CITIZENS screaming]

173
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,500
[yelping]

174
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:57,875
[laughs]

175
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:01,291
Eliza! No! Eliza!

176
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:02,791
Oh, my.

177
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:05,666
Now there's a
fine-looking specimen.

178
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:10,583
Tell me, my dear,
am I beautiful?

179
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:13,708
Care to take a guess
at my age? I'm waiting.

180
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:15,666
Uh. What have you done?

181
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,791
You're some kind of monster!

182
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:20,583
No one calls me
a monster. No one!

183
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:29,625
What have we here?

184
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,833
It looks like one of the
Knights managed to escape

185
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:34,500
the Spatial Magic after all.

186
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:44,791
Ooh, and lucky for me,
this one's a beauty.

187
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:47,875
What do you say we have
some fun together, lovely?

188
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:49,000
I'm not gonna let you hurt

189
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:52,500
any more of these
people. You old hag.

190
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:55,083
[CATHERINE]
You're dead.

191
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,833
Ooh, and lucky for me,
this one's a beauty.

192
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,958
What do you say we have
some fun together, lovely?

193
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,083
I'm not gonna let you hurt

194
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:19,791
any more of these
people. You old hag.

195
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,750
[CATHERINE]
You're dead.

196
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,750
How dare you call me an old hag?

197
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:29,375
Ash Curse Magic:
Cheerful Ash Destruction.

198
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,166
These little shells
contain all kinds

199
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,708
of lovely curses.

200
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,125
The best part is you won't know

201
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:42,625
what they'll do
until they hit you.

202
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:47,875
Who are you and
why are you here?

203
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:50,375
What are you people
hoping to accomplish?

204
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:52,458
[CATHERINE] Ah, so you have
enough breath to chat,

205
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,041
do you? Very well.

206
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:57,333
Your pretty face has
earned you an answer.

207
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:59,458
Our mission is
relatively simple.

208
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:01,791
There's a certain someone
we mean to get rid of.

209
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,250
And who would that be?

210
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,166
Oh, come now, you
don't honestly think

211
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,625
I would tell you.

212
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:12,625
Right! Good looks
only get you so far.

213
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,500
[FUEGOLEON] There's at least
one other involved

214
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:19,375
in this plot besides you.

215
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,666
This invasion required
the use of Spatial Magic

216
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,375
on an immense scale.

217
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:25,666
So, tell me, where
is your partner?

218
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,541
Have they escaped already?

219
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:31,666
[FUEGOLEON]
They may have managed to send

220
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,750
the Magic Knights away
from the capital,

221
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:35,708
but that doesn't mean they
have the power necessary

222
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:38,250
to capture it.

223
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:40,166
Nor do I believe this
to be something as simple

224
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,958
as a feint to reach the king.

225
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,916
You've made it clear
your personal motive

226
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,708
is revenge, but I sense that
there was a larger purpose

227
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,250
behind the attack.

228
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:08,000
[laughs]

229
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:10,916
You want to know
what we're after?

230
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,208
You, Fuegoleon Vermillion.
We came for you.

231
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:15,500
For me?

232
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,083
But why him?

233
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:20,458
Yes, why?

234
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:27,833
Spatial Magic again,
eh? Very well.

235
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:30,125
Maybe now we'll get
to the bottom of this.

236
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:34,708
[LEOPOLD]
Fuegoleon!

237
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:42,500
[FUEGOLEON]
Strange. What is this place?

238
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:03,416
[grunts]

239
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:09,375
[YUNO grunts]

240
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:11,541
[YUNO]
Her attacks just keep coming,

241
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,541
and she isn't tiring at all.

242
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:15,458
The shells themselves
don't do much damage,

243
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,333
but what's inside them...

244
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:19,625
[YUNO grunting]

245
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:22,541
Oh, dear! Look at you flail.

246
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:25,666
Which of my curses has its
grip on you now, I wonder?

247
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,291
You don't seem to be
so chatty anymore.

248
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:31,583
Damn you.

249
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:35,250
[YUNO]
My eyes. I can barely see now.

250
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:39,166
It's not just my vision.
All of my senses are fading.

251
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:42,833
Say, can you hear me? Hello?

252
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:44,875
[laughs]

253
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:47,166
[YUNO]
My hearing's almost gone now.

254
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,625
What kind of power
does this woman have?

255
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:52,625
Are you enjoying my
Cheerful Ash Destruction spell?

256
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:54,916
It works slowly but
quite effectively.

257
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,708
It looks like you've
lost your vision,

258
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:58,458
and your hearing too,
I would guess.

259
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:01,500
Soon you won't even be
able to move. [laughs]

260
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:04,000
Sensory deprivation and
the fear that comes with it.

261
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:07,291
That's your punishment
for calling me an old hag.

262
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,833
[YUNO]
The four-leaf clover.

263
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:14,625
I joined the Golden Dawn to
live up to the expectations

264
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:16,666
that came with this grimoire.

265
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,750
[CATHERINE laughing]

266
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:21,333
[YUNO] But, what happens
if I never can?

267
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:22,708
[GOLDEN DAWN MEMBER 24A]
Four-leaf clover or not,

268
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,541
you're still just a
commoner. Don't get cocky.

269
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,875
[ALECDORA] Hmph. Your skills
merit little attention

270
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:30,250
in the Golden Dawn, village boy.

271
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:31,541
[GOLDEN DAWN MEMBER 24B]
Soon enough,

272
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:33,375
no one will remember your name.

273
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:36,333
[YUNO] I ignored the
people who doubted me.

274
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:38,000
Instead, I honed my skills

275
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:42,583
and worked to make myself
unbeatable. Except...

276
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:46,833
I couldn't win. It wasn't
me who defeated him.

277
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:50,375
It was a power buried
in that dungeon.

278
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:53,666
One I just happened
to stumble across.

279
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,250
A power I can't control.

280
00:17:56,333 --> 00:18:01,083
No matter what I do,
I can't get it to listen to me.

281
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:04,875
I couldn't even evade the
Spatial Magic on my own.

282
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,250
I escaped because
the power reacted.

283
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:10,208
A power I can
hardly call my own.

284
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:11,958
[ALECDORA]
His work may be sub-par,

285
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:14,708
but it's not as if we
expect much of a commoner.

286
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,000
[YUNO]
No, that's not it.

287
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:17,541
I don't care what they say.

288
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:20,250
That's not what
really frustrates me.

289
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,666
[YUNO yells]

290
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:27,541
[laughs] Was that supposed
to be aimed at me?

291
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:31,458
Here, let me show you how
to aim a spell properly.

292
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:33,666
I'll make you a deal.
Grovel for me.

293
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,041
I might let you live
if it's good enough.

294
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,875
Let's see how prettily
you beg. Well?

295
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:41,041
Not a chance.

296
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:46,166
[YUNO]
Blind. I can't see anything.

297
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:52,375
[YUNO] Numb, too.
I can't feel anything.

298
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:12,250
[YUNO]
Is this the manastream?

299
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:14,416
[NARRATOR]
Mages who wield wind-based magic

300
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,208
are particularly skilled
at sensing mana.

301
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:20,416
The enemy's attack deprived
Yuno of his senses.

302
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,583
However, with all other
distractions taken away,

303
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:26,250
his sensitivity to mana
became even more heightened,

304
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:29,125
and made possible
what came next.

305
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:32,458
Come on now, open that
stubborn mouth of yours.

306
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:34,458
I'm not going to wait
forever, you know.

307
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:38,333
Hurry up, or I'll have
to kill you. [laughs]

308
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:41,125
There are so many things
I want to know about you.

309
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:43,125
So, let's hear you beg.

310
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:44,041
Well? Well?

311
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:45,625
I don't hear you.

312
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:48,958
[YUNO]
Please. Just shut up.

313
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:51,666
I don't care about you
or what you want.

314
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:55,250
Only one thing
matters to me now.

315
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:58,791
I can't lose.

316
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,416
[YUNO gasps]

317
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,875
[YUNO]
Not to Asta.

318
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:04,416
I'm not done!

319
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,041
[CATHERINE]
Is that what I think it is?

320
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:14,250
The legendary four-leaf
clover grimoire?

321
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:29,041
[CATHERINE]
The mana. It's gathering.

322
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:30,375
It feels like...

323
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:32,958
No, impossible.

324
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:36,125
Is he... controlling the mana?

325
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:38,875
[YUNO]
I see now.

326
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,791
The spirit has been
sending out mana signals

327
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,333
this whole time.

328
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:45,208
But I relied too much
on my vision and hearing,

329
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:47,666
so I wasn't able to sense them.

330
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,708
There's just one
very important thing

331
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:54,291
to know about me.

332
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:55,750
The truth is...

333
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:58,500
I would rather give
my life than lose!

334
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:02,166
Wind Spirit Magic:
Sylph's Breath!

335
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:06,250
[CATHERINE] One chance.
I have to use the power I stole.

336
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,708
[CATHERINE screams]

337
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:26,916
It's you!

338
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:02,916
[FULL CAST]
Clover Clips!

339
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,541
[YUNO]
"Birthday."

340
00:23:08,458 --> 00:23:11,625
I finally figured out how
to command the wind spirit.

341
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:15,375
I've decided to name you Bell
and make today your birthday.

342
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:17,416
I got you a cake and everything.

343
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,958
Yay!

344
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:20,250
[YUNO]
There's just one candle.

345
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:22,000
I hope that's okay.

346
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:24,875
Hooray. Happy birthday, Bell.

347
00:23:24,958 --> 00:23:26,666
Pretty!

348
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:29,750
Go on, make a wish,
then blow it out.

349
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:31,791
[BELL]
Well, um.

350
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:34,375
Ah!

351
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:42,666
[BELL]
Huh? Where did the cake go?

352
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,166
I found it.

353
00:23:46,666 --> 00:23:48,125
[LEOPOLD]
Where did you send my brother?

354
00:23:48,208 --> 00:23:50,375
Answer me if you wanna live.

355
00:23:50,458 --> 00:23:52,791
[LEOPOLD gasps] Fuegoleon,
what happened to you?

356
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:54,250
Brother!

357
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:57,416
<i>Black Clover</i> ,
Page 25: "Adversity."

358
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,458
Always remember to
stay calm. [screams]
