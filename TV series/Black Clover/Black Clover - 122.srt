can make even the cruelest fates

159
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,624
bounce right off him.

160
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:31,376
I couldn't ask
for a better partner.

161
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:34,462
In fact, he makes me look good
just being his superior!

162
00:08:34,546 --> 00:08:36,673
So many snacks he hasn't tried.

163
00:08:36,756 --> 00:08:39,175
It would be a crime
if he died now!

164
00:08:39,259 --> 00:08:41,219
[ZORA]
He's a stupid little shrimp,

165
00:08:41,302 --> 00:08:43,596
but I'm willing to admit,
he's pretty close

166
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,224
to what a Magic Knight
is supposed to be.

167
00:08:46,307 --> 00:08:47,892
I mean, kind of.

168
00:08:47,976 --> 00:08:50,812
He's a loud, reckless,
obnoxious idiot.

169
00:08:50,895 --> 00:08:52,939
But as royalty, I have
to admit he's a person

170
00:08:53,023 --> 00:08:54,858
the kingdom can't do without!

171
00:08:54,941 --> 00:08:56,484
But... It's not that
I would really care

172
00:08:56,568 --> 00:08:58,111
one way or the other.

173
00:09:03,491 --> 00:09:05,869
We're not leavin'
here without him.

174
00:09:05,952 --> 00:09:07,620
[BLACK BULLS]
Give Asta back!

175
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:14,753
Ah, yes, the Black Bulls.

176
00:09:14,836 --> 00:09:16,921
[NOBLE 122L] What's that
strange vehicle of theirs?

177
00:09:17,005 --> 00:09:19,007
[NOBLE 122M]
They have no right to be here!

178
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:20,675
[NOBLE 122N]
How dare you disturb

179
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:23,470
these honorable proceedings?

[DAMNATIO]
Yami Sukehiro.

181
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,309
[DAMNATIO] Am I to understand
that you and your companions

182
00:09:29,392 --> 00:09:33,438
are defending the criminal
who started this great war?

183
00:09:33,521 --> 00:09:35,774
I trust you know what will
happen to the Black Bulls

184
00:09:35,857 --> 00:09:38,693
as a result of your foolishness?

185
00:09:38,777 --> 00:09:41,112
[YAMI] Obviously,
you haven't heard of us.

186
00:09:41,196 --> 00:09:45,533
We're basically the worst Magic
Knight squad that ever existed.

187
00:09:45,617 --> 00:09:48,661
And both of those brats with
the horns are members.

188
00:09:49,996 --> 00:09:50,955
Me, too?

189
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:53,041
[YAMI]
You messed with our squadmates.

190
00:09:53,124 --> 00:09:55,919
So call us riffraff,
rebels, whatever.

191

We're here to take
back what's ours!

[ASTA squeals]

You may be innocent,

195
00:10:16,231 --> 00:10:18,566
but you're still going to be
punished for touching Marie.

[ASTA screams]

00:10:19,984 --> 00:10:23,071
Not now, Brother! Let him be!

198
00:10:23,154 --> 00:10:24,572
[NOELLE] I can't believe
you were gullible enough

199
00:10:24,656 --> 00:10:27,158
to walk into a trap
I warned you about!

200
00:10:27,242 --> 00:10:30,412
What, are you too stupid to keep
yourself alive for five minutes?

201
00:10:30,495 --> 00:10:33,081
[ZORA sighs]
Obviously, he is.

202
00:10:33,164 --> 00:10:34,874
[LUCK]
This is a great time for a duel!

203
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:37,585
[MAGNA] The day you die
is the day I die!

204
00:10:37,669 --> 00:10:38,795
[GAUCHE]
Put Marie down right now

205
00:10:38,878 --> 00:10:41,715
or I'll give you
the death penalty myself!

206
00:10:41,798 --> 00:10:44,384
[ASTA] I thought you guys
were here to save me!

207
00:10:44,467 --> 00:10:46,511
[MARIE]
Stop it, Big Brother!

208
00:10:48,263 --> 00:10:49,764
That's an odd way
of thanking someone

209
00:10:49,848 --> 00:10:52,308
for protecting your sister.

210
00:10:52,392 --> 00:10:54,019
[YAMI] Thanks for lockin' up
my squad members,

211
00:10:54,102 --> 00:10:56,354
you royal jackass.

212
00:10:56,438 --> 00:10:59,774
Real nice "justice"
you got there.

213
00:10:59,858 --> 00:11:01,276
Please don't worry
about me, sir.

214
00:11:01,359 --> 00:11:03,486
Take Asta and get out of here!

215
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:06,656
I'm not from this era, and
because of the forbidden magic,

216
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,616
I'm not even human anymore.

217
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,870
Besides, I basically used you
to complete my mission!

218
00:11:13,371 --> 00:11:15,457
You've got some nerve,
sayin' all that stuff

219
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:18,168
after I let you crash at
our hideout for so long.

220
00:11:19,753 --> 00:11:21,004
[YAMI] You've been
watching us forever,

221
00:11:21,087 --> 00:11:23,757
and somehow, you still
don't get it.

222
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,052
[MAGNA]
Oh, yeah, I heard all about you.

223
00:11:27,135 --> 00:11:30,221
So you were kicking ass as
a little bird for 500 years?

224
00:11:30,305 --> 00:11:31,848
How awesome is that?

225
00:11:31,931 --> 00:11:34,684
[HENRY]
And all... by... yourself!

226
00:11:34,768 --> 00:11:39,898
You must've... been...
so lonely. Poor... thing!

227
00:11:39,981 --> 00:11:42,442
[HENRY] I definitely know
what that feels like.

228
00:11:42,525 --> 00:11:43,860
We can always use another

beautiful young
lady on the team!

230
00:11:46,196 --> 00:11:47,739
You worked hard in the shadows,

231
00:11:47,822 --> 00:11:49,991
so we'd probably
get along really well.

232
00:11:50,075 --> 00:11:52,243
I would ask if you
and I could be friends,

233
00:11:52,327 --> 00:11:56,206
except, we've been best friends
since the moment I was born.

234
00:11:56,289 --> 00:11:57,999
Um, yes, please join us!

235
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:00,085
You've seen all the fun
we have together.

236
00:12:00,168 --> 00:12:02,087
Now you can be
a part of it, too!

237
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:04,839
[CHARMY] Just promise me
you'll share your snacks!

238
00:12:04,923 --> 00:12:06,383
Wow, it's a good thing
I didn't eat her back

239
00:12:06,466 --> 00:12:07,676
when she was a bird.

240
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:09,552
Tell me I didn't hear that.

241
00:12:11,554 --> 00:12:14,766
Look, the Black Bulls
are a wacky group of misfits,

242
00:12:14,849 --> 00:12:17,185
so if you're worried about
bein' too different for us,

243
00:12:17,268 --> 00:12:19,854
you must not have
been payin' attention.

244
00:12:19,938 --> 00:12:23,400
Besides, I'm already
familiar with your ki.

245
00:12:23,483 --> 00:12:27,362
Trust me, one more weirdo
isn't gonna hurt anything.

00:12:27,445 --> 00:12:28,863
Are you sure?

In that case...

...I'll join you!

251
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:54,055
Sounds good.

Our squad's rep is as pitch
black as it gets anyway!

That's us.

we are the Black Bulls!

It seems I haven't
made myself clear.

Even if you protect
that devil's cohorts,

257
00:13:18,663 --> 00:13:21,666
it won't change
the outcome at all.

258
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:25,503
Causing a fuss here won't
clear the criminal's name.

259
00:13:25,587 --> 00:13:28,340
In fact, the charges against him
for conspiring with a devil

260
00:13:28,423 --> 00:13:31,009
will become more severe.

you still couldn't have

you're trying to take care

since Asta never
did anything wrong.
