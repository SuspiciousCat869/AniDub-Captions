Ha, hoof!

162
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:22,083
[FRAGIL]
This is weird. I thought we won.

163
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:23,333
What's going on?

164
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,083
I'm not sure.

165
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:30,000
Hold on. Why are
those two fighting?

166
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:32,541
There's a crystal at each
opponent's starting position

167
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:35,750
for the semifinal match
between Team B and Team G.

168
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:37,666
What? We're starting it already?

169
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,333
It bears repeating
that this is simply

170
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:41,541
a tournament match,
not an actual fight.

171
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:43,833
Your goal is to smash
the other team's crystal,

172
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,916
not to injure, maim, or kill
anyone on the battlefield.

173
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,416
Best of luck to both teams.

174
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,958
I'm sorry, you guys. Really.

175
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,791
I kind of got us into a mess.

176
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:04,583
I just wanna beat
him. So badly!

177
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:05,833
Please, help me do that!

178
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,583
Of course.

179
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:10,000
[MIMOSA] Something isn't
right with Langris.

180
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:10,916
He seems so...

181
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,083
[ZORA laughs]

182
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:14,333
What's funny?

183
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:17,333
[ZORA laughs]

184
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,375
You're seriously pulling
us into this because

185
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:21,083
you're mad at
another Magic Knight?

186
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:24,250
Have you lost your mind,
or are you just an idiot?

187
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,666
--Say what?
--[ZORA] But sure, why not?

188
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,208
That guy doesn't stand a chance

189
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:29,958
against our team
if we go at him.

190
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:32,708
So, let's win this match,
you rotten runt.

191
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:37,583
[FRAGIL] Langris? I feel
like I missed something.

192
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:39,250
What happened while
we were gone?

193
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:39,958
[LANGRIS]
Shut up.

194
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,500
[BOTH gasp]

195
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:44,500
Ha, ha. Is that how you
talk to your teammates?

196
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,583
Well, worry not, this
time around my magic

197
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:47,541
will easily best them.

198
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:48,583
[LANGRIS]
I don't need you.

199
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:50,458
Ha, huh?

200
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:53,166
[LANGRIS] Nothing but
weaklings, everywhere I turn.

201
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,041
I'll show you how
extraordinary I am,

202
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:57,875
and I promise you
won't ever forget it.

203
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:10,375
[MARX]
Involuntary betrayal?

204
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:11,708
That's right.

205
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:13,750
Judging by the look of
things, I believe someone

206
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:16,250
within our ranks is
unwittingly cooperating

207
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:18,000
with the Eye of
the Midnight Sun.

208
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:19,625
The most likely
candidate would be

209
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:21,625
one of the members
of the Magic Knights.

210
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:23,625
[MARX]
I'm not sure what you're saying.

211
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:25,375
Are they being
controlled by magic?

212
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:28,041
Maybe. I can't be certain.

213
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:31,208
I suppose... it could be magic.

214
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:34,208
But, then, whose is it?

215
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,625
[MARX] He may be distractible
and constantly running off

216
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,916
in search of interesting magic,

217
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,500
but his intuition
is usually spot on.

218
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:44,083
That means something
is definitely amiss.

219
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:48,125
[JULIUS] The Royal Knights
Selection Exam will be

220
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,000
the perfect opportunity
for us to uncover

221
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:51,416
this unwitting traitor before

222
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,500
the situation spirals
out of hand.

223
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:54,833
[gasps]

224
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:56,166
[JULIUS] When you put your
own mana on the field

225
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,833
in order to face off against
powerful opponents,

226
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:02,208
you end up revealing your
true nature in the process.

227
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:04,500
That sounds dangerous.

228
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:08,708
[JULIUS]
It is, but... we'll do it.

229
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:13,500
[MARX]
Could it be Langris?

230
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:16,750
Is he the one who doesn't
realize he's betraying us?

231
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:18,125
If that's the case...

232
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:20,083
We'll take our crystal
with us and protect it

233
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:21,000
while we head for theirs,

234
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,875
the same way won
the first round.

235
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:25,291
Mimosa, can you
handle transport duty?

236
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:26,125
[MIMOSA]
On it.

237
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,750
We'll need you to cover us.

238
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:31,625
There's been a slight change
in the sequence of events.

239
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,208
Semifinals, Match One.

240
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:35,916
Team B is Xerx,
Mimosa, and Asta.

241
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,041
Team G is Langris,
Fragil, and Sekke.

242
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,291
Begin!

243
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,583
[MARX] Asta's team is
already on the move.

244
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:49,916
[LANGRIS] If I'm not careful,
that anti-magic sword

245
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,500
will destroy our crystal
in a single blow.

246
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,208
Which means...

247
00:12:56,708 --> 00:13:00,125
[LANGRIS] The best strategy is
to destroy him and his crystal.

248
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:01,625
I'll end this whole
match now before

249
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:03,500
they ever get an attack in.

250
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:06,916
[ASTA yells]

251
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,083
[ASTA] I can slice through
these blasts just fine since

252
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:12,083
they don't disappear at the
last second like Magna's did.

253
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,416
But, dang, there's a lot of 'em.

254
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,958
[ASTA grunts]

255
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:19,041
[MIMOSA] Recovery Magic:
Princess-Healing Flower Robe!

256
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:20,541
Thanks, Mimosa!

257
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,791
That's cute, but there's
no way her recovery spells

258
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:24,041
can keep up with my attacks.

259
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,958
[yells]

260
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:28,708
It would be easier if
you gave up already.

261
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,791
[VANESSA] Asta's fighting
his butt off out there!

262
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:33,791
You better fight just as hard,
or you'll look like a fool!

263
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:35,958
[LANGRIS] I'm telling you,
that coward isn't fit to fight,

264
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:37,875
much less be a Magic Knight.

265
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:40,833
I'm the superior brother
in every possible way!

266
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:44,916
Someone who'd abandon
his countrymen so easily

267
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,333
is no knight!

268
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:47,791
[LANGRIS]
Well, too bad.

269
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,708
I suppose they'll have to
make the ultimate sacrifice

270
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:50,625
for their country.

271
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:51,958
You don't seem to get it!

272
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:54,333
Finral's only ever used
his magic to help people!

273
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,125
He's a real hero, the
complete opposite of you!

274
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:59,000
You think something like
that should be praised?

275
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:01,458
It just means he never
learned to defeat his foes.

276
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:02,750
That's not something
to be proud of--

277
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:04,666
it shows how weak he is.

278
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:11,583
Asta, no!

279
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,000
[MIMOSA]
Not good.

280
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:15,333
Respect the mage who keeps
on winning until the end.

281
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:18,708
He's the one who's
doing everything right.

282
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,916
You think so.
Well, that's great.

283
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,125
It means I'm doin'
everything right!

284
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,041
[ASTA]
I'm gonna beat you, Langris.

285
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,708
For Finral's sake!

286
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:29,458
Don't be ridiculous.

287
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:30,916
Asta, look out!

288
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:35,000
Don't give up yet!
It's not over.

289
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:37,708
Asta!

290
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:40,708
[MARX] This isn't a tournament
match. Not anymore.

291
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:42,583
What do you think will
come from this fight?

292
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:44,375
What's your plan, Wizard King?

293
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,625
[MIMOSA] My Recovery Magic
isn't fast enough.

294
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,708
You can't keep taking
damage from his attacks,

295
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,500
Asta, at this rate your
body will give out

296
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:58,708
before the crystal does!

297
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:00,125
[ASTA]
Not yet!

298
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:07,250
[ASTA] Sharp pains in
my muscles and bones.

299
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:09,666
That's the feeling
I was waiting for.

300
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,125
My cooldown period's over.

301
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:14,333
Right now, I can only
harness this dark power

302
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:16,250
two times a day.

303
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,958
I was gonna bust it
out the second time

304
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:19,583
for my showdown with Yuno.

305
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:22,250
But I can't wait that long.

306
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:23,500
Thing is...

307
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:25,291
...I need to concentrate
and get my ki flowing

308
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:27,000
before I can actually use it.

309
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:28,625
And I don't see that
happening right now,

310
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:30,333
not with him on my tail.

311
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:36,916
So... How about
some help, Xerx?

312
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,958
[ZORA] You moron.
Don't tell me what to do.

313
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:44,583
Perfect timing.

314
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:47,791
[ZORA] I'm only doin' this cause
I really don't like that guy.

315
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:54,083
Look at him, smirking with
all the confidence in the world.

316
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:55,583
[ZORA]
Dammit.

317
00:15:57,666 --> 00:16:01,958

[NARRATOR]
Zara was the first commoner

348
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,166
to become a Magic Knight.

349
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,250
He took the entrance
exam when he was 15,

350
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,500
but failed every time
he attempted it.

351
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,666
Even fatherhood
didn't deter him,

352
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,500
but instead, lit
a fire under Zara

353
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,708
as he bolstered
his efforts to pass.

354
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:36,583
His diligence impressed his son,

355
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:39,291
who watched his father
with profound respect.

356
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:42,125
And when his father did finally
become a Magic Knight,

357
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:45,083
there was no one prouder.

on the battlefield today.

360
