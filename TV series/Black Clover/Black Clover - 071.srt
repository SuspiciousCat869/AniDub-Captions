And now you have
forced me to endure

24
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,541
the disgrace of coming in fifth?

25
00:02:56,625 --> 00:03:00,125
All because my <i>frater stultum</i>
is currently out of commission?

Wait a second.

Are you tryin' to tell me
that this crazy lady

They're siblings?

35
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,958
That brother of mine
has always been a buffoon!

How could he have produced
such a pack of cowards?!

Hold on, that's not true!

41

That's right!

44
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:40,166
Captain Fuegoleon was
a perfect example

45
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,083
of the kind of person
that every Magic Knight

Well, if you feel that
strongly about it,

00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:15,625
happy-drugs in those
cocktails o' his.

161
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:18,958
[RILL] Captain Yami!
I really look up to you!

162
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,458
I mean, I only came in
last place this one time,

163
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:23,875
and look how busted up
I let myself get.

164
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:25,583
But you were in dead
last, like, forever,

165
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:26,916
and you never lost your cool!

166
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,625
That's like,
superhuman or something!

167
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,250
You really are amazing!

168
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:32,541
You're so confident!
So thick-skinned!

169
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:35,375
You don't care how much
people laugh at you!

170
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:37,291
Even though you were
always the worst,

171
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,958
you did everything your way!

172
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:40,458
Uh, thank you?

173
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:43,458
[DOROTHY grumbling]

174
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:45,083
[YAMI] For the last time,
I don't understand

175
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,333
anything you're sayin' to me!

176
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:51,791
[JACK] Keh! You just
wait until next year!

177
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,458
Aw, come on, you really leavin'?

178
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,000
What's wrong, beanpole!

179
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,166
Any other day you'd be beggin'
me to go drinkin' with you!

180
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,666
[JACK]
Shut it!

181
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,833
Suit yourself.

182
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:01,083
I guess that means
I'll be knockin' back

183
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,083
this celebratory
booze without ya!

184
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,625
[laughs]

185
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:07,666
[MEREOLEONA] You sure are riding
high for a one-time winner.

186
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,791
[YAMI]
Huh? Oh, Sisgoleon.

187
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,666
Where do you get that name from?

188
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,166
[YAMI]
You're Fuegoleon's sister,

189
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,541
so I assumed that was right.

190
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:17,041
You honestly believe
a lineage as proud as mine

191
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:19,291
would name their
offspring so carelessly?

192
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:22,000
You don't? I figured you just
take whatever thing you are

193
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:25,166
and slap a "goleon"
on the end of it.

194
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,125
You're such a simpleton.

195
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:30,291
[YUNO, ASTA grunt]

196
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:32,583
Oh, hey, how's
it goin', Captain?

197
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:36,708
[laughs] Looks like she
got a hold of you, kid!

198
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:38,625
How'd that happen anyway?

199
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:41,166
Uh, that's kind of a long story.

200
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,166
[MEREOLEONA]
You're coming, too.

201
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,208
[YAMI]
Huh?

202
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,416
[MEREOLEONA]
Being late's bad enough,

203
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,208
but you didn't even show up!

204
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:47,833
[YAMI] Hey, wait--
Wait stop it, 'goleon.

205
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:50,208
[MEREOLEONA] You need to
learn a little discipline!

206
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:52,875
[YAMI] Discipline? But I'm
already the captain!

207
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:55,875
Sorry, Yami, but it
serves you right.

208
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:57,291
[MEREOLEONA]
You, too.

209
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:59,625
You're not taking
my Char anywhere!

210
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:01,041
And who are you?

211
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:02,083
[SOL]
Don't worry, Char.

212
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:03,333
I may not know what's going on,

213
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:05,750
but I'd follow you
anywhere in the universe!

214
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:08,083
For the last time,
it's "Captain."

215
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:10,708
Asta! So this is where
you've been hiding!

216
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:12,333
Listen, it's not like
you were the reason

217
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:15,291
we came in second, so dispense
with the celebrating

218
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:18,208
and help me give Kahono
and Kiato a proper sendoff!

219
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:19,166
Uh!

220
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:22,041
Oh. Mereoleona. Uh...

221
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:23,333
Wow, it's been too long!

222
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:25,416
Well, have a nice night!

223
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,958
[MEREOLEONA]
Ah-ah.

224
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:29,833
Noelle.

225
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:30,833
Um, yes, ma'am?

226
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:32,041
You're comin', too.

227
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:33,583
What? Wait a minute!
You can't be serious!

228
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,708
I don't have anything
to do with this nonsense!

229
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:37,375
Yeah, and how many
fiery cat paws

230
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,208
can this lady possibly have?

231
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,208
[YUNO]
But why me? It's not fair.

232
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:42,583
Don't be a baby.

233
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:44,916
Got any idea where
she's taking us?

234
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,708
A hot spring, I think?

235
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:50,833
[NOELLE]
Uh, hot spring?

236
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,625
[sighs] Oh, hey there, Noelle.

237
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,375
Could you wash my back for me?

238
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:57,958
[NOELLE gasps]
You're such a pervert!

239
00:10:58,041 --> 00:10:59,333
[ASTA]
I am?

240
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:01,958
[MEREOLEONA]
All of you, settle down!

241
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:05,458
[ALL yelping]

242
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:11,416
[BARTENDER]
Thank you for your patronage.

243
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,541
Well, how do you like that?

244
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:19,750
It looks like things are
about to get more interesting.

245
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:34,333
[ASTA]
What the...?

246
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,958
This is the hot spring?

247
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:40,291
What's the holdup?
Let's get to work!

248
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:53,625
[MEREOLEONA] Yultim Volcano
is a strong magic region.

249
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:55,750
Deep underground there's
a volcanic belt

250
00:11:55,833 --> 00:12:00,541
that's laced with mana and
constantly spewing out lava.

251
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:02,041
[CRIMSON LIONS gasp]

252
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:04,541
[MEREOLEONA] Normal humans
can't set foot in this place.

253
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:07,291
But if you reach the peak,
you'll find the most fantastic

254
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:10,708
and revitalizing hot spring
you can imagine!

255
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:11,750
How's that?

256
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,583
Are you getting excited?

257
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,375
Come! Let's head for the summit!

258
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:19,125
[ASTA]
I wouldn't say "excited."

259
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:24,291
No way! This place is
a nightmare! Then again...

260
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:36,750
[CHARLOTTE]
Sol. Please wash my back.

261
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:39,875
[SOL]
A hot spring with Char? Sweet!

262
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,375
Look, Sol.

263
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,208
There was really no reason
for you to tag along with us.

264
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:44,291
What are you talking about?

265
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:45,750
I told you I'd
follow you anywhere,

266
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:48,375
so this'll be easy
as pie! Okay, Char?

267
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:49,583
Call me, "Captain."

268
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:50,833
Roger, Char!

269
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,833
I say we make it a race
to see which one of us

270
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:55,333
can get to the summit first!
Are you game, Asta?

271
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:57,625
Sure, I could stand
to blow off some steam!

272
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:58,833
I'm ready when you are!

273
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:01,458
Hey, golden boy!
Are you in, or what?

274
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:02,916
Knock yourselves out.

275
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,333
[LEOPOLD gasps]

276
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,250
[LEOPOLD]
Oh, right, he's Mr. Cool.

00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:07,500

278
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,625
Yeah, but you get used to it.

279
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:12,500
Quit wasting time and let's go!

280
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:18,208
[CRIMSON LIONS yell]

281
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:20,166
[ASTA]
All right, time to do this!

282
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,583
[LEOPOLD]
Our magic should do the trick--

283
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:25,083
[BOTH gasp]

284
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:27,666
[LEOPOLD]
What's the deal with this heat?

285
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,875
The mana in the
atmosphere is going crazy!

286
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,500
I'm suffocating!

287
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:34,125
[LEOPOLD]
It's hard to breathe.

288
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:37,375
I feel like my chest is
on fire and my sweat glands

289
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:39,583
are about to explode!

290
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,791
[LEOPOLD] And on top of that,
she expects us to climb

291
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:48,833
an erupting volcano?
There's just no way!

292
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:51,750
[BOTH gasp]

293
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,291
[YAMI]
If I try to duck out,

294
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,166
Sisgoleon's gonna
come after me again.

295
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,041
Guess I'm doin' this.

296
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:01,666
[CHARLOTTE] Why did she
insist on bringing me?

297
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,041
It's a good thing I'm
starting to sober up.

298
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:07,166
If I fail, I'll be a disgrace
to women everywhere!

299
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,000
Let's make this quick.

300
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:14,041
Wow, the captains
are unbelievably strong.

301
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:16,000
It's like the magma's
not even affecting them!

302
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:17,125
Yeah, but they shouldn't be able

303
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:18,625
to move like that
in this environment,

304
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:20,250
it's not humanly possible!

305
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,458
So cool!

306
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:27,250
I think I know! They're
both using Mana Skin!

307
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,583
[NARRATOR] To some extent,
all Magic Knights

308
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:32,000
use magic power to enhance
their physical abilities

309
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:33,791
in combat situations.

310
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:36,000
But the height of this skill
is a fundamental spell

311
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,000
known as Mana Skin.

312
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:40,750
Even in unstable
conditions such as these.

313
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:43,333
Yami and Charlotte are able
to emit a constant stream

314
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,541
of magic power that
encases their body

315
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,166

Mana Skin? That's nothing.

Yeah, but not everybody
can sustain it

Her magic's an awful fit

[YAMI] And the little Golden
Dawn prodigy is their age,

a little girl who feared

from your mana, that's changed.

You resemble her on the

She was a powerful Magic Knight,

returning to the
field of battle?

This is no time to cry!

385
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:08,166
So the children have
already told you.

386
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:13,333
Lady Acier, the Magic Knights

387
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:16,375
need you to return to your
post as soon as you recover.

I honestly don't
understand why you

would put your life
in such danger.

I know I don't need
to remind you,

00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:24,916
but once the Magic Knights
decide to enter the fray,

392
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,125
they will never stop fighting
in order to protect

its people, even if it means

they must put their

she'll do whatever's

That's what being a

There's nothing stronger than
