1
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:15,625
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:18,541
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:24,625
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:27,166
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:35,708
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:39,750
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:45,166
[NARRATOR] Vetto's true might
had awoken within him,

8
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,250
and with it, staggeringly
massive power.

9
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:50,625
Asta called on all of
his remaining strength

10
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:52,500
to face the beast.

11
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:55,375
[ASTA]
The way I see it, not giving up

12
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:57,208
is the strongest
weapon I've got!

13
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:59,958
And there's no way I'm gonna
quit before my wish comes true--

14
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:01,416
do you understand me?

15
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,083
Not ever!

16
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:06,708
[NARRATOR] Asta's courage
spurred his teammates

17
00:01:06,791 --> 00:01:07,916
into action.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,083
I'm here now solely
because of your refusal

19
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:11,291
to give up the fight.

20
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:13,666
Our juniors are giving
it all they've got.

21
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,958
Time for us to show off
our most advanced stuff.

22
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:18,625
We're not about to
let you die, Asta.

23
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:20,083
We'll be fighting beside you!

24
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:21,791
[ALL]
Let's do this!

25
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:27,958
[VETTO yells]

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,583
[VETTO]
Nice try, brat!

27
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:33,291
But the Spatial spell's
power and your aura

28
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:36,125
give away your every move!

29
00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:39,791
[VETTO]
What?

30
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:41,916
The thread's trajectory shifted.

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,583
[yelling]

32
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:46,291
[ASTA]
This is <i>my</i> weapon.

33
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:49,291
Now watch. I will defeat you!

34
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:24,458
[VANESSA, FINRAL gasp]

35
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:25,958
[ASTA]
It worked!

36
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:31,375
[VETTO]
Oh, you've done it now, human!

37
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:32,583
[VETTO grunts]

38
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,041
--Thanks!
--[FINRAL] Jeez.

39
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:38,250
That was close!

40
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:39,875
A second slower and
he would've ripped you

41
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:41,083
into pieces for sure.

42
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:42,541
That's how you do it, kiddo!

43
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:43,875
Now keep it up!

44
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,333
I don't know what
you're talking about.

45
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:46,708
I didn't do anything.

46
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:49,041
That was all you and Finral.

47
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:50,541
[NOELLE]
Amazing.

48
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:53,750
Who knew that those two had
that kind of talent in them?

49
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:03,125
[VETTO] As I suspected.
I can't heal this.

50
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:06,791
Did he cut off the very flow
of my self-healing magic?

51
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,750
[VETTO]
That's the only weapon here

52
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:14,166
that stands a chance
of defeating me.

53
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,458
His anti-magic sword.

54
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,625
Even with it, that runt
would be no match

55
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,166
for me on his own.

56
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,875
But with those two
giving him backup,

57
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:25,291
he has considerably
more mobility.

58
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,416
The Spatial Magic
is troublesome,

59
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,708
but the real nuisance here
is that woman's Thread Magic.

60
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:36,375
[VETTO] There are threads
strung all through this space.

61
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:39,708
They could come into play
at any time, from any corner.

62
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:42,375
The threads themselves
lack the strength to attack

63
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:45,458
or bind me on their own,
but they're too fine

64
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:49,958
for the eye to see or for
their magic power to be felt.

65
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:53,458
Which means I can't
predict the brat's moves!

66
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:59,125
[VETTO cackles]

67
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:01,000
How fascinating!

68
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:04,166
Taken separately, you humans
are so much trash,

69
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,708
but with three of you
working together,

70
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:08,583
it seems you can actually fight.

71
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:11,375
And I find that disgusting!

72
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:14,666
[VETTO] You may think there's
strength in numbers,

73
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,791
but that's just an illusion.
You have no hope!

74
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:18,666
He's coming!

75
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:19,541
Get ready!

76
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:20,625
[yells]

77
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:22,375
All right!

78
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:23,458
[ASTA yells]

I'm not done!

00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:39,583
All right!

85
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:40,875
It's gonna take a lot
more than that!

86
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:42,416
We could cover him in scratches

87
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,958
and it wouldn't be enough
to take him down.

88
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:47,708
[FINRAL] Things are about to
get even more dangerous here.

89
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:49,375
[VANESSA] We have to get
the kid in as close

90
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:51,333
as we possibly can!

91
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:54,291
Get me right up
in his furry face!

92
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:56,250
I'll give it
everything I've got.

93
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,875
So I'm not imagining things.

94
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:04,125
What now?

95
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:06,541
It feels like an immense
and malevolent power.

96
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:10,625
[GREY whimping] Whatever it is,
it's even more unbelievably

97
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:13,708
massive than the unbelievably
massive magic I felt earlier!

98
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:15,583
It's unbelievably unbelievable!

99
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,208
Shut up! Quit babbling
like an idiot!

100
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,125
[GREY]
Please don't look at me!

101
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:21,541
Get over it already.

102
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:24,208
We need to do something.
Has your magic recovered at all?

103
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:26,875
[GREY] Um. No. Not even
a little, sorry.

104
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:30,666
Tch. I used up all of mine
against that Chain Magic loser.

105
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,750
I couldn't manage a single
Reflect Ray right now.

106
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:36,625
This is just great.
Hey, little piggy!

107
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:39,083
Don't tell me you went on alone!

108
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:43,750
Seriously, are you already
stuffing your face again?

109

[CHARMY]
Mm-hm!

110
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:47,208
Using that Strike of
the Sleeping Sheep spell

111
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:50,666
emptied my tummy along with
all of my magic reserves.

112
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,833
You wouldn't expect me to fight
on an empty stomach, would you?

113
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:55,708
Come on, we might as
well fill our bellies

114
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:58,541
while we wait for
our magic to recover.

115
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:00,000
Yeah, I guess you're right.

116
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:01,833
Eating a little can't hurt.

117
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:04,125
We'll find the others
once we're rested.

118
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:05,333

Yes, that's it!
That's the spirit!

Well done.

Those two are normally useless,

they've pushed past
their limits.

[YAMI] Tch. Not again.
He took another blow?

Asta's the one going
face-to-face with a monster.

The pressure you're under

With so many spells,

I'm draining them
pretty quickly.

I'm still managing, though!

150
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,833
[FINRAL] Guess it worked out
that I spent the whole time

151
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:41,583
here running away
instead of fighting.

[ASTA]
Please! This? This is nothin'.

162
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:12,791
One blow just happened
to graze me, that's all.

163
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:14,166
Now come on, let's go!

164
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,875
[YAMI]
Hold up, kid!

165
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:17,583
Captain Yami?

166
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:20,000
[YAMI] Fightin' in close like
you are, you should know

167
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:25,041
better than anyone that blow
didn't "just happen" to land.

168
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:27,583
He wants to learn your timing,
your battle quirks,

169
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:28,833
your weaknesses.

170
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:30,750
To do that, he's been
holdin' back his attacks

171
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,583
and goin' on the
defensive instead.

172
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:35,458
[gasps] What, really? No!

173
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:39,083
If you fly in there hasty
and unprepared, well...

174
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:42,166
Next time, you're dead for sure.

175
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:52,250
[YAMI] If you fly in there
hasty and unprepared,

176
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,708
next time, you're dead for sure.

177
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:58,041
[NOELLE]
No! Is that true?

178
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:01,875
[VETTO chuckles]
That's a dark swordsman for you.

179
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:03,375
With battle instincts like that,

180
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:06,083
you're going to make
an excellent main dish.

181
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,875
But what do you
expect them to do

182
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:09,333
with this information?

183
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:12,916
Knowing my strategy won't
change their situation.

184
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,625
You pitiful humans.

185
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:16,000
Attack whenever you're ready,

186
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:19,000
but the next one
will be your last!

187
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,875
You don't know that,
you overgrown furball!

188
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:23,250
Or you, Captain!

189
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:26,083
We can't know what'll happen
until we actually try!

190
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:27,500
[YAMI]
The hell I don't know!

191
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:30,666
I'm like a gajillion times
stronger than you.

192
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,416
Is that right? Then how
about you quit watching

193
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,416
and get down here already!

194
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,166
[YAMI]
Oh, you went there, huh?

195
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,625
Hittin' me right where it hurts.

196
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:41,708
[growls] It's freakin' killing
me that I gotta just

197
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,041
watch all this play out.

198
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:47,041
Do you have any idea
how pissed off I am?

Calm down, okay?

202
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:54,083
I'm not tellin' you
not to attack.

203
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:55,625
Huh?

204
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:58,916
[YAMI] What I'm sayin' is ya
can't do it like ya did before.

205
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,375
You can beat him.

206
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,416
But you three have
to be smart about it.

Yes, sir!

[YAMI] You know what to do
at a time like this.

212
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,208
Let me hear you say it!

00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:12,583
Right here, right now.

past our limits!

We're still in this!

Come on, you guys,
let's keep on pushing!

--Understood.

[VANESSA]
Kiddo.

227
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:52,583
When I see you fighting
so hard even though

228
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:55,625
you have no magic of
your own, I start to feel

229
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:58,458
a kind of courage
I never thought I had.

230
00:11:58,541 --> 00:11:59,916
I'd forgotten.

231
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,666
Buried the knowledge
as deep as it would go.

232
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,583
Blotted out the memory
of my weakness

233
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:06,791
in the Forest of Witches.

234
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,833
[VANESSA]
Hey, did you know?

235
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,958
There's a big town
outside this forest,

236
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:12,708
and I've heard there are
tons of people living there

237
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:15,083
who aren't witches!

238
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:16,750
[BIRD]
Silly Vanessa.

239
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:20,166
You must have told us about
that place 1,000 times now.

240
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,666
Isn't that where all the
other witches have gone?

241
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,625
To have fun and find boyfriends
and stuff like that?

242
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:28,125
[DOLL] Why not escape this
cage and join them?

243
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:29,375
You want to, right?

244
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:30,458
[VANESSA]
What? No!

245
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:33,166
That's impossible. I mean...

246
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:39,041
[VANESSA] I could never
defy the Queen of Witches.

247
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,541
[BIRD] Hey, it's all right.
Don't look so sad.

248
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:42,750
[DOLL]
I know!

249
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:45,125
Want me to ask the Queen
of Witches for you?

250
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:46,583
That won't work.

251
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:50,000
You're nothing more than a
doll I made using my magic.

252
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:54,125
So if I can't do something,
you certainly can't, either.

253
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:55,666
[DOLL]
That's right.

254
00:12:55,750 --> 00:13:00,166
And this whole conversation
is just you talking to yourself.

255
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,166
[BIRD] Someday, it would be
nice to have real friends

256
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,291
to talk to.

257
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:08,791
Yes, it would,
but it'll never happen.

258
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:13,041
I'm stuck here.
Inside this cage, forever.

259
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,625
I'll never be free.

260
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:22,583
[VANESSA] I assumed those were
the cards fate had dealt me.

261
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:26,083
It seemed hopeless,
so I gave up.

262
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,500
But...

263
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:34,750
[VANESSA] One day, I realized,
being stuck there

264
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,958
wasn't my fate after all.

265
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:40,166
I'd simply lacked
the courage to change.

266
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:44,541
[VANESSA] I left the Forest
of Witches and chose life

267
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:49,375
with the Black Bulls instead,
and it was the right choice.

268
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:51,916
We hold the threads of
fate in our own hands,

269
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,291
and it's our choice
what to do with them.

270
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,375
Asta! I'll pull you back in!

271
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:57,916
Just trust me and go!

272
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,833
Thanks, Vanessa,
I'm counting on you!

Take it easy, you two!

We don't wanna go faster
than we can handle.

278
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:16,208
This is the problem
with passionate people.

279
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:20,000
Much safer to be motivationally
challenged, like me.

[gasps]

282
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:24,750
[FINRAL'S FATHER]
Why are you wielding your magic

283
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:27,958
so ineffectually?

284
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:29,166
For generations,

285
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:32,250
House Vaude has used
offensive Spatial Magic,

286
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:34,708
and it has served us
well as Magic Knights.

287
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,916
What use would that
spell be in battle?

288
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:40,208
But...

289
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:43,083
I don't wanna hurt
anybody or get hurt.

290
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,708
That sounds scary.

291
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:47,166
[FINRAL'S FATHER]
Gutless weakling.

292

[FINRAL'S STEPMOTHER]

293
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:56,458

[FINRAL'S FATHER] Don't worry,
we'll have someone fix

297
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,500
whatever you've broken.

298
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:05,333
[FINRAL'S STEPMOTHER]
You just keep practicing.

We'll take care
of everything, dear.

300
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,083
[FINRAL'S FATHER]
Honestly, Finral.

301
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:12,750
Aren't you ashamed to be shown
up by your younger brother?

302
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,541
[FINRAL'S FATHER]
You're brothers.

303
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:24,708
How could there be such a
difference in your abilities?

304
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:26,875
[FINRAL'S STEPMOTHER]
Why, just look at Langris.

305
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:30,250
He's already been made
vice-captain of the Golden Dawn!

306
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:31,833
[FINRAL'S FATHER]
And what have you accomplished?

307
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:34,625
You're nothing but a pack
mule for the Black Bulls,

308
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:37,083
the worst Magic Knight
squad there is.

309
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:39,041
[FINRAL'S FATHER] Langris
will be taking over as head

310
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,250

[FINRAL gasps]

312

[FINRAL'S FATHER]
I trust you don't object.

313
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,416
[FINRAL laughs]
No, of course not.

314
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,291
I was just thinking it'd
be a huge responsibility.

315
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:51,916
Take good care of
the place, Langris.

316
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,958
I don't need you to tell me
how to handle my affairs.

317
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:57,416
You're a disgrace to our house!

318
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,625
[FINRAL] Uh... Yeah,
I guess you're right.

319
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:04,333
But hey, at least the girls
really like my pretty face.

320
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:08,500
[FINRAL] I ran away from my
father, my brother, my home.

321
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:09,666
From reality.

322
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,208
Hello there!

323
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:14,708
You ladies sure are looking
lovely! Wanna go grab a drink?

324
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:17,166
I know a nice café
not far from here.

325
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,833
[FINRAL]
I've got to say, darling.

326
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:22,541
If you're as sweet
as you are beautiful,

327
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:24,875
I don't think we'll be
ordering any dessert.

328
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:29,583
[FINRAL]
And then... I met you, Asta.

329
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:32,166
A boy utterly without magic.

330
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:35,166
Not too little--none at all!

331
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,208
Instead of running from the
fact that you couldn't cast

332
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:40,000
a single spell, you faced
it head-on and fought

333
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,416
without ever giving up.

334
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:46,375
True, I can't hope to best
my brother as I am now.

335
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:48,375
But...

336
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:49,250
[FINRAL]
Yami?

337
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:50,625
What?

338
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:53,000
It's just that... Why'd you
let me join your squad

339
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:55,375
knowing I'm not
much of a fighter?

340
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:57,416
Figured you'd come in
handy as a chauffeur.

341
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:01,333
[gasps] Yeah. I guess
that makes sense.

342
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:02,916
I mean, it's not like
my spells are good

343
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,375
for taking down
enemies or anything.

344
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:13,333
Maybe not, but you've
probably got your own way

345
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:15,125
of fightin', don'tcha?

346
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:18,666
[YAMI] There's a lot more
to battle than just

347
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,041
taking down enemies, y'know.

348
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:27,375
[FINRAL] Is it possible?
My own way of fighting?

349
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:31,375
I know I'll never be
the strongest mage.

350
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,291
But I'll do what I can
to make the Black Bulls

351
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:35,583
the strongest squad!

352
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:37,875
I stepped away
from my own fight.

353
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:41,250
And when I did, there were
words I couldn't say anymore.

354
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,541
But I can say them now!

355
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:46,833
[FINRAL] Asta! I swear
I won't mess this up!

356
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:49,125
Please, just trust me, okay?

357
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:50,458
Too late, Finral!

358
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:52,958
I already trust you completely!

359
00:17:55,458 --> 00:18:01,166
[VETTO laughs] I'm impressed.
You aren't half bad.

360
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,958
But you'll be at
your limit soon.

361
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,791
If even one of you
slips up, you'll be dead,

362
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:09,083
and you'll take the
other two with you.

363
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:12,666
How long do you think you
can actually keep going?

364
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,166
Shut up! You really
don't get it.

365
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:18,500
We'll keep fighting like this
for as long as we have to!

366
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:22,916
[FINRAL] Asta said he
trusts me completely.

367
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,166
And I guess it has to be true.

368
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,291
Because how else could we
possibly be pulling off

369
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:29,666
this ridiculous
method of fighting?

370
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,000
[VANESSA]
Really.

371
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:33,458
How can you so easily put
your life in our hands?

372
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:36,166
A drunken lush and
a superficial slacker.

373
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:39,291
Still, whatever made
you believe in us.

374
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,166
[FINRAL, VANESSA]
We won't betray your trust!

375
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,541
[ASTA yells]

376
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:44,666
Well done.

377
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,208
Your ability to focus
is commendable.

378
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:50,791
Although... How is your
magic holding out?

379
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:53,583
You'll be scraping the
bottom of the barrel soon.

380
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,958
Absolute amount of power.

381
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:58,416
That is the definitive
difference between my kind

382
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,958
and yours, ya fragile
little insects.

383
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,458
[FINRAL]
He may be full of himself,

384
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:05,875
but unfortunately,
he's not wrong.

385
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:08,166
My portals are
starting to shrink.

386
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:11,208
[VANESSA]
My threads, they're screaming.

387
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:14,416
With my magic running out,
they could snap any minute.

388
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,083
[ASTA] I trust you two,
and we're gonna win!

389
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:18,625

00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:30,291
Yeah!

Gauche?! Charmy!

396
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:39,166
And, uh...

397
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,500
[GAUCHE]
That's Grey.

398
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:42,625
And this might sound like
a terrible joke, but,

399
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:44,250
that's actually what
she looks like.

400
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:46,708
[NOELLE, FINRAL, ASTA, VANESSA]
What?!

401
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:49,500
[GREY]
Please! Stop looking at me!

402
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:51,458
Save all that for later.

403
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:56,250
Right now, take this, with all
the magic power I can muster!

What are you playing at?

406
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,958
Ya think with enough
blasts, one has to land?

407
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:09,250
I think you're right
where I want you to be.

You're out!

414

They want a smokescreen?

415
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:29,166
Good luck with that!

416
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:33,083

[gasps] But how?

421
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:45,250
Um. I used my Transformation
Magic to make some doubles.

422
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:46,375
I'm low on power, though,

423
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:49,000
so some of them
aren't quite right.

424
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:50,416
[GAUCHE]
Nicely done!

And you, keep going

Time to plunge you

Yeah, right!

432

waste on despair?

Right. I'll just
pull on my thread,

and when I do, it will
change your direction.

Yeah I'm good.

442
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,375
All I have to do is charge.

443
00:23:08,458 --> 00:23:12,583
All right, Gordon.
Let's do this.

like this game, Gordon,

00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:33,041
I think it would work
a lot better if I could

452
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:35,500
actually hear you when
you said "red light."
