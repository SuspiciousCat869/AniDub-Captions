1
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:15,625
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:18,416
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:24,583
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:27,041
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:35,666
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,708
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:45,708
My, how imperfect.

8
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:48,083
Since he's able to
wield that sword,

9
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:52,000
I had assumed he must be
a member of that bloodline.

10
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:55,625
Why don't we show them
what you really are?

11
00:00:56,916 --> 00:00:59,583
[heartbeats]

12
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:44,458
[ASTA]
Huh? What is this place?

13
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:49,250
[ASTA]
Don't tell me I'm... dead?

14
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:54,583
[ASTA]
No, it can't be.

15
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:57,375
I still haven't gotten
to marry Sister Lily.

16
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:01,958
[ASTA]
And...

17
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:06,125
Come on. No.

18
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:13,500
[DEVIL]
Hey, you. Good to see ya.

19
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:19,833
[screams] What the heck are you?

20
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:23,500
[laughs] I can't believe
you'd say that me.

21
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:26,333
I've been your closest
companion for a while now.

22
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:29,333
Uh-- I'm pretty sure I'd
remember a guy like you!

23
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:32,791
Ah, well, doesn't
make any difference.

24
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:35,500
I got a chance to manifest
in the physical world,

25
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,583
so I'm taking it.

26
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:41,250
Your body belongs to me!

27
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,416
[ASTA] Tell me what's
goin' on, right now!

28
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,166
You should be glad--it's a
pretty sweet deal for you.

29
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,916
I mean, really!
You wanna win this?

30
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,750
Then all you have to do
is leave it to me.

31
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,083
You shut up!

32
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:58,083
I'll beat this guy with
nothin' but my own power!

33
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:00,291
[DEVIL] Quit naggin'
and let me take control

34
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:02,458
of your mind already!

35
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:05,958
Just relax and let go
of your consciousness.

36
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:10,458
A half-pint like you doesn't
stand a chance in this fight.

37
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:14,125
[ASTA]
That's not up to you, now is it?

38
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,750
Ya know what?
It's kinda perfect

39
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:18,291
that you're loomin'
over my head like that.

40
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:20,541
[DEVIL]
Huh?

41
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,000
'Cause if you're up there,
then I can use you

42
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:24,375
to climb straight to the sky!

43
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:29,166
[DEVIL laughs]
Some places can't be climbed to.

44
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,708
You should just give up.

45
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:34,000
[REVCHI] This world has no
use for someone like you,

46
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:35,708
a poor, magic-less fool.

47
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:38,041
You might as well give
it all up right now.

48
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:41,208
You were born a loser,
you worthless runt!

49
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:50,250
[ASTA grunting]

50
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,458
[ASTA]
Give up?

51
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,833
[ASTA] There was a time
in my life when I might

52
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:03,458
have given up, but that's
all behind me now!

53
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:11,166
[ASTA, DEVIL yell]

54
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:29,250
[ASTA]
My magic is never giving up!

55
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:37,166
[LADROS]
What? How's he back on his feet?

56
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,916
[NARRATOR]
The leaves of a clover are said

57
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,708
to each contain one thing.

58
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:44,375
In the first three dwell
integrity, hope, and love.

59
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:47,958
The fourth leaf is given
over to good luck.

60
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:52,458
And in the fifth,
there lives the devil.

61
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:57,458
[NOELLE]
This feeling... It's not magic.

62
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:59,666
What's with him?

63
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,208
Something isn't right here.

64
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:08,250
[LADROS laughs] So you had this
big dramatic transformation.

65
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:12,125
Did you expect me to be
impressed by that or something?

66
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,500
[LADROS yells]

67
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:20,500
[LADROS]
You're mine!

68
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:31,708
[LADROS grunts]

69
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,250
[LADROS yells]

70
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,208
[LADROS] I can see that
you're a little quicker

71
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:50,916
on your feet now!

72
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,541
But how long will this new
trick of yours hold out?

73
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:08,000
[LADROS yells]

74
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:12,750

[yelps]

76
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,583
[LADROS] D'you think I was
gonna fall for that twice?

77
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:20,833
[LADROS]
Damn. He's not messing around!

78
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:23,916
How did he get so strong?

79
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
[yells]

80
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:31,625
This next attack
can't possibly miss.

81
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:32,958
[thud]

82
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:35,916
[ASTA growling]

83
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,458
[LADROS screams]

84
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,750
[ASTA]
What's happening?

85
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:59,125
My body's chilled to the bone,

86
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:01,750
like I'm floating
in a freezing lake.

87
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:04,958
My mind feels clearer than ever.

88
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:09,625
And my physical
strength is overflowing!

89
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,500
[LADROS groans]

90
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:18,291
I thought for certain
he'd lose consciousness,

91
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:21,416
but he's still
maintaining control.

92
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,541
Not only does the
demon-slayer sword

93
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:26,916
conduct anti-magic energy
in massive amounts,

94
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,625
it absorbs the magic
of all who touch it.

95
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:32,583
Therefore, no one should
be able to wield this blade,

96
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:34,083
but you are without magic,

97
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:37,333
and so its power
courses through you.

98
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,083
You've been dictating
its ebb and flow

99
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:42,958
from the beginning without
even realizing it.

100
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:45,291
When I used my
blood to heal you,

101
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:48,333
it increased the rate
of that power's movement.

102
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:51,291
In doing so, I intentionally
removed any limitations

103
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,208
on the sword's capabilities.

104
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:55,416
Now, your magic power
will burst forth

105
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,500
in a massive wave, and you
will become the vessel

106
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:01,416
for this torrent of anti-magic.

107
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:07,875

What... are... you?

119
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,958
[QUEEN OF WITCHES]
I'd suspected you were

120
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:22,375
of a certain bloodline,
but I was wrong.

121
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:25,125
[LADROS]
What is this awful feeling?

122
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:27,250
[QUEEN OF WITCHES]
Due to your body's mutation,

123
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,416
the mana did not
dwell within you.

124

Simply put, you're defective.

125
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:37,166
But because of that, you're
able to hold the sword.

126
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,833
How the hell is this happening?

127
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:41,833
You aren't anything special.

Not in the slightest.

And that is precisely what
makes you extraordinary.

130

against you. Finish him.

My magic should have
made me invincible!

Get back! Just stay
away from me!

It's no use.

139

will chase down

it happen here?

161
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:47,875
You must be crazy!

162
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,416
Huh?

163
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,625
It's better if I keep you
alive so you can help

164
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:53,000
all the people that you hurt!

165
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:55,458
And then I'm gonna make you
apologize to all of 'em!

166
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:57,833
Now patch yourself
up and get going!

167
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:00,208
You may be all bloody
and gross-lookin',

168
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:03,416
but that doesn't mean that
I have to go easy on ya!

169
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:13,916
[laughs]

170
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,166
[coughs]

171
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,208
[ASTA]
What the heck is your problem?

172
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:20,750
[LADROS gasping, groaning]

173
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:23,375
[LADROS]
Damn. I can't catch a break.

174
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:25,083
You're a tough guy.

175
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:26,916
Ooh!

176
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,875
This is outta character.

177
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:32,041
Maybe... now that the magic
stone's been destroyed,

178
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:35,583
my head's starting to
feel a little bit lighter.

179
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,291
Aw, man.

180
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:42,375
[ASTA] You sure you're
okay? 'Cause you fell...

181
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:45,083
[LADROS] Someone like you
is headed straight to the top,

182
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:49,541
that's for sure.
Makes me wonder.

183
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:52,291
If we'd met sooner,
maybe you and I

184
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:55,208
could've made each
other better, too.

185
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,083
[FANZELL]
Thank you, Asta.

186
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,041
[ASTA]
Dude, are you sleeping?

187
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:03,208
Keep your eyes open
so I know you're alive!

188
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:06,791
[NOELLE] I'm overthinking it.
He's still Asta.

189
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:14,208
I'm normal now. That was weird.

190
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:16,541
[ASTA] What was all that
black stuff earlier?

191
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:20,833
It felt like I was fighting
something inside of a dream.

192
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:25,000
[ASTA] But I had some
kinda mysterious power,

193
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:29,625
so that was pretty awesome!
I mean, I owned it!

194
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,250
Is this what everyone
else feels like

195
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:35,666
when they use their
magic abilities?

196
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,541
[ASTA groans] Oh god, my whole
body started hurtin'

197
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:40,833
all of a sudden, and it
feels like my insides

198
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,666
are bleedin' like crazy, too!

199
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,166
I'm gonna die!

200
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,791
Hey, can somebody
please help me?

201
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,416
--[NOELLE] Help you?
--[FANZELL] Look at us.

202
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,250
Wait, the rest of you
are in bad shape, too?

203
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:54,416
Hey, you two! You've
got Recovery Magic!

204
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:58,125
Come on, don't tell me
you already bit the dust!

[FANA grunts]

207
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:02,375
[ASTA]
Oh, good, you're alive!

208
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:05,000
Don't just lay there!

209
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:07,333
[FANA] Oh, dear, I hope
I'm not too heavy.

210
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:08,666
No.

211
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,375
In fact, the pressure
feels kind of comforting.

212
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:12,166
[ASTA]
He's way different now!

213
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,750
[FANA]
Mars, stop it.

214
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,291
[ASTA]
Hello?

215
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:17,458
Well, it's gonna take a whole
buncha trips back and forth,

216
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:19,041
but I guess the only
thing for me to do

217
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,333
is to carry everybody
back to safety!

218
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,500
[QUEEN OF WITCHES]
That's not necessary.

219
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:38,333
[ASTA yelps]

220
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,541
It's you!

221
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:50,666
The Queen's here!

222
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,625
I took care of the
Eye of the Midnight Sun

223
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:54,625
and all those
Diamond Army soldiers!

224
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:58,458
So that outta make us even
for you fixin' my arms, right?

225
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:02,416
And you did it without me having
to involve myself in the least.

226
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,333
Imperfect though you may be,

227
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,541
I must say, you've
done quite well.

228
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:09,250
Aw. It's no big deal!

229
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,458
Hey, while I've got you here--

230
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:13,958
and I kinda hate
to ask this, but...

231
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:17,000
Do you think you could heal
everyone real quick, too?

232
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,416
[ASTA]
Huh?

233
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:29,541
Ah. That's also unnecessary.

234
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:44,208
[NOELLE]
Huh? What is she--?

235
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:45,583
[VANESSA]
Noelle!

236
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:54,750

[DOMINANTE gasps]

00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:13,625
They're going to be
okay. I just know it.

242
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:15,208
You're right.

243
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:19,250
[FANZELL]
Her power is horrifying.

244
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,416
[ASTA]
You show up outta nowhere,

245
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,958
and then you do thi--

246
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:33,875
[ASTA groaning, screaming]

247
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,958
[QUEEN OF WITCHES]
Yes, my magic allows me

248
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:44,416
to manipulate blood as I please.

249
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,291
Ever since I cast that
healing spell on you,

250
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:51,208
I've maintained total control
over your blood, as well.

251
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:55,000
[QUEEN OF WITCHES]
I am the Queen here.

252
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:57,916
Why should I fulfil the
requests of a pathetic worm

253
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,708
such as yourself?

254
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:08,875
The only one who
must obey is you.

255
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:12,375
Blood Magic: Puppet's Blood.

256
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,375
[BOTH]
Let him go!

257
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:25,666
That aside, your death would
prove inconvenient for me.

258
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,958
You alone will receive healing.

259
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:30,458
Blood Recovery Magic:

260
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:33,500

00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,541
[QUEEN OF WITCHES]
Stay by me, and you may wreak

262
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,666
all the havoc you like.

263
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,625
[NOELLE]
Casting such advanced spells,

264
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,291
one right after the other.

265
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,625
This isn't like
the Spirit's power.

266
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:56,583
Just being close to it
is giving me chills!

267
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:59,916
She's worse than I thought!

268
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,083
[QUEEN OF WITCHES]
As for that sword...

269
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:04,791
If I cannot wield it myself,

270
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:08,291
I simply need to be the
master of the one who can.

271
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:11,583
And you've just demonstrated
how you use it.

272
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:14,166
So, for as long as you live,

273
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,166
you're going to
carry this weapon

274
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,250
as though it were mine.

275
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:30,666
[gasps]

276
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,791
No! What's happening?

277
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:39,208
[VANESSA] All this time,
she was only after

278
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:41,250
the anti-magic sword?

279
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:51,041
And now for your first order.

280
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:53,625
I want you to kill every
one of these weaklings

281
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:56,250
with your own hands.

282
00:21:56,333 --> 00:22:01,000
Do a perfect job,
and leave no one alive.

283
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:04,333
Asta... No.

284

[yells]

285
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:48,458
[FANZELL] So, the Queen
just wanted control

286
00:23:48,541 --> 00:23:50,583
of Asta's anti-magic all along.

287
00:23:50,666 --> 00:23:54,166
Damn, with powers like that,
no wonder she isn't aging!

"The Red Thread of Fate."

289
00:23:58,083 --> 00:24:00,791
Vanessa! What kind
of spell is that?
