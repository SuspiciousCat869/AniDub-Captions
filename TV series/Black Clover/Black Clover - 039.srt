1
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:15,666
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,750
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:24,583
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:27,416
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:35,666
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,916
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:47,125
[JULIUS] The Eye of the
Midnight Sun has as its leader

8
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:49,500
a man named Licht,
a mage with a coveted

9
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:51,791
four-leaf clover grimoire.

10
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:53,958
Six years ago,
he formed a terror group

11
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:56,625
bent on opposing
the Clover Kingdom.

12
00:00:56,708 --> 00:01:00,000
It now counts some 50
mages as its members.

13
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:02,250
Beneath Licht are the
three ranking members

14
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:06,166
known as the Third Eye:
Rhya, Vetto, and Fana.

15
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,958
Their power far
outstrips the others'.

16
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:11,500
The organization's members
harbor a deep hatred

17
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:13,791
of the Clover Kingdom,
which drives their

18
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:16,375
acts of terrorism
against our country.

19
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:20,250
Their ultimate goal is to
establish a sovereign state.

20
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:23,208
That all sound correct so far?

21
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:24,125
[BOTH]
Yes.

22
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:25,375
Now, then.

23
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:28,875
The juiciest tidbit
is probably this:

24
00:01:28,958 --> 00:01:32,041
The traitor who cooperated with
the Eye of the Midnight Sun,

25
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:34,458
is one of you, our
Magic Knight captains.

[ALL gasp]

But which captain?

31
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,208
[GUELDRE chuckles]

32
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:54,291
[ASTA] You're the reason
Captain Fuegoleon got hurt.

33
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:55,583
But, why?

34
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:57,875
Why would one of the
captains turn traitor?

35
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,208
[JULIUS] All right.
Now, will you tell us?

36
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:33,958
Who among those gathered here
is the traitorous captain

37
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:36,833
who collaborated with the
Eye of the Midnight Sun?

38
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,791
Go on, tell us their name.

39
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:45,583
[BOTH]
The traitor...

40
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:48,666
...is the Purple Orcas captain,

41
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,875
Gueldre Poizot.

42
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:51,291
[ALL gasp]

43
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:54,541
Uh-- Ridiculous. What are
you trying to say?

44
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:56,458
These two are terrorists
guilty of attacking

45
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:58,291
the royal capital itself.

46
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,166
You would have to be crazy
to believe a word

47
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,666
out of their mouths!

48
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,541
I've never given
anyone cause to doubt

49
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:05,250
my loyalty to this kingdom!

50
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:08,250
Well, that isn't exactly true.

51
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:11,583
I have heard a few distasteful
rumors regarding you.

52
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,250
Is that all, Charlotte?

53
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,541
I've heard a great deal
more than a few.

54
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:18,333
No way! Are you guys serious?

55
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:19,708
[YAMI]
Sure are.

56
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:23,416
There're rumors all over
the damn place. It's crazy.

57
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,500
And now it seems they
weren't baseless, after all.

58
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,708
I always knew that you were
up to something sneaky,

59
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:31,958
but I never imagined even you
would stoop to this level.

60
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:33,625
This isn't funny!

61
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:36,000
There's obviously been
a mistake! Yes!

62
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,250
Those two are trying
to set me up,

63
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,791
and you're all falling for it!

64
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,791
Impossible. They've
answered honestly,

65
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:44,791
with all the information
at their disposal.

66
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:47,791
Anything said under the
spell's compulsion is true.

67
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:48,791
Without a doubt.

68

[YAMI]
There ya have it, Hammy.

00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,166
Who are you calling "Hammy"?

71
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,041
Hey, now, calm down.

72
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:58,166
Why don't you get Mushroomhead
to use his fancy spell on you?

73
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,416
He can sneak a little peak
inside that head of yours.

74
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,666
If you've been a good ham,

75
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,750
you'll have nothin'
to worry about.

76
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:07,416
Apart from the stupid
nickname, I agree completely.

77
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,583
If you're truly innocent,

78
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,625
you should jump at
the chance to prove it.

79
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,833
[GUELDRE]
Well, I don't know.

80
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:14,791
Hey, what's the
matter there, Hammy?

81
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,708
You get shy all of a sudden?

82
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:18,625
[CHARLOTTE]
Most disgraceful, Gueldre.

83
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:20,875
Such a betrayal is unforgivable.

84
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:22,875
It should be a capital offense.

85
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:25,000
So you really are
a traitor, then?

86
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:29,750
You jerk! You betrayed
your fellow captain!

87
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:32,375
No! This is some kind of trap!

88
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,541
I'll find a way
to clear my name,

89
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,291
but for now, I'll
have to retreat.

Things're getting' serious now.

Not good. He's invisible.

95
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:57,416
And as long as he is, all magic
will pass right through him.

96
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,166
So basically, we're screwed.

97
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,625

With my magic, I'm untouchable.

Yes, "The Drowning
Captain." Whatcha think?

161
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:23,458
No way. What kinda
magic is that?

162
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:29,458
[NOZEL] Honestly, Rill. You and
your half-baked nonsense.

163
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,916
Yeah, well, somebody
had to do something.

164
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,583
Or else you'd destroy
this entire building.

165
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,791
His magic makes all
spells pass through him,

166
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,666
but not physical objects.

167
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:42,333
Therefore, we need only attack
with non-magical items.

168
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,541
If this building must
fall to bring him down,

169
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,541
commoners can easily rebuild it.

170
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:51,541
I missed the chance to fight
a fellow captain in real combat.

171
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:54,000
It woulda been fun, too,
slicing up that ham

172
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,583
into tiny little pieces.

173
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:57,583
Magic Knight captains
can't stand around

174
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:58,791
twiddling their
thumbs while there's

175
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,708
a traitor waiting to be caught.

176
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:03,458
At least gotta strike
a pose or somethin'.

177
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:06,375
[YAMI] Seriously,
are you still snoozing?

178
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:08,250
Although, you did manage
to keep up with us,

179
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:11,750
so I guess you're pretty
sharp for bein' asleep.

180
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:14,375
What a pitiful excuse for a man.

181
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:16,375
Running like a coward.

182
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:19,791
He was a failure as a
captain long before this.

183
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:21,208
[CHARLOTTE]
Why is Yami paying so much

184
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:22,750
attention to Dorothy?

185
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:25,750
Is she the type
of woman he likes?

186
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,875
Enough. Let's leave it
there for now.

187
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:33,125
Consider this--someone else may
be controlling him with magic.

188
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:34,916
[JULIUS]
Well, I'm glad the rest of you

189
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,708
were here to help
wrangle our traitor.

190
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:40,833
I'm afraid I couldn't have
gone so easy on him.

191
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:42,875
[ASTA]
These people are crazy!

192
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:44,875
And they're the best
of the Magic Knights.

193
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:47,125
The best mages in
the entire kingdom?

194
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:48,791
Hey, I don't know
what you just did,

195
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,541
but it was amazing!

196
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,500
How'd you know where
Captain Poizot was?

197
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,625
And how'd you break
his Transparency Spell?

198
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:57,125
Um, well, I just...

199
00:10:57,208 --> 00:11:00,083
Never mind! I'm Rill,
and I'm 19. Who're you?

200
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:01,666
I'm Asta, and I'm 15.

201
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,208
I can't believe you're only 19
years old and you're a captain!

202
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:07,250
[laughs] Ah, so you're
younger than me, then!

203
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,333
I think we should be
friends, what d'ya say?

204
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:12,083
Friends? With a
captain? Seriously?

205
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,083
Okay great!

206
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:14,416
Yay! Awesome!

207
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,708
You know, these guys,
they're older,

208
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:18,625
and I mean, talking to them.

209
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,083
It's tough. So... Right?

210
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:24,083
Yeah-ha, ha! Ah. Boring! Man!

211
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:26,583
[YAMI]
You know we can hear you, right?

212
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:29,583
And who the hell're you
to call anyone boring?

213
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,500
[whimpers]

214
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:32,583
All right.

215
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:35,125
So far all you've done
is make excuses.

216
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:36,791
Let's hear the truth.

217
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:44,708
[JULIUS]
Now, Gueldre.

218
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:46,250
Have the answers
you've given us up

219
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:49,000
to this point all been truthful?

220
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,333
They have.

221
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:51,791
[gasps]

222
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:53,666
You know, I have to
hand it to you, Hammy,

223
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,500
that's quite an impressive
list. Let's see here.

224
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,041
Beatin' up your own
squad members,

225
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,666
misappropriating magic tools,

226
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,291
and smuggling
dangerous magic drugs.

227
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:05,166
You were way dirty before
the whole traitor thing.

228
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,250
Hell, with all that dirt,
you're more of a Black Bull

229
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,208
than anyone in my squad.

230
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:11,166
Well, in your case,
I guess "Blackened Ham"

231
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,500
would be more accurate.

232
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:15,625
Keh. Do you ever stop
running your mouth, Yami?

233
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:17,708
[CHARLOTTE] No wonder he didn't
want us reading his mind

234
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,708
with Marx's spell.

235
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:21,583
You didn't mention
his worst crime.

236
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,791
Abducting a guardian mage.

237
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:27,333
That's direct cooperation with
the Eye of the Midnight Sun.

238
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:28,875
At least now we know
how they were able

239
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:31,083
to invade the royal capital.

240
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:32,958
[NOZEL] The fool was so
blinded by the offer

241
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:36,833
of rare magic tools, he made
a deal with terrorists.

242
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:39,958
So, he's greedy and immoral.

243
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:42,333
Does that really
surprise anybody?

244
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:44,250
The Eye of the Midnight
Sun likely killed

245
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:46,208
the abducted guardian
mage shortly after

246
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:48,000
the attack on the capital.

247
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:51,583
His actions are both
unprecedented and unforgivable.

248
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:55,041
He was a Magic Knight, charged
with protecting our people,

249
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:57,083
yet he sold them out instead.

250
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:59,750
If word of this got out,
the populace might panic.

251
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:02,208
So we won't be making
this matter public.

252
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:04,875
I want you to take a
good look at your squads.

253
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:07,333
Make sure none of them
have ties to the enemy.

254
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:09,250
This cannot happen again.

255
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:10,750
[MAGIC KNIGHTS]
Yes, sir!

256
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:17,625
[RHYA]
Well!

257
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,333
I put on quite the performance.

258
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:27,041
Nobody can see through my
Copy Transformation Magic.

259
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:30,791
So, which person in the
room was actually me?

260
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:32,833
That ought to keep them
from being suspicious

261
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:34,708
for a while at least.

262
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:36,958
[RHYA whistles]

263
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:44,166
[JULIUS]
I'm sorry for keeping you two.

264
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,875
I won't detain you for long.

265
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:48,750
It's a terrible feeling,

266
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:53,166
to be betrayed by somebody
who once fought alongside you.

267
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,083
I sprinted at full speed
to get where I am,

268
00:13:56,166 --> 00:14:00,416
but as a result, I may have
made mistakes along the way.

269
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,291
[YAMI] Did you keep us
behind to tell us that?

270
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:06,708
Because, if so, Julius, I gotta
say, you picked the wrong guys.

271
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:08,625
[JULIUS] There was one more
piece of information

272
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:10,375
the Midnight Sun
members revealed

273
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,125
during their questioning.

274
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:13,583
Asta.

275
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,333
Remember the hideout
they took you to

276
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:16,750
after you were captured?

277
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:19,250
And the mysterious stone tablet
that was hidden there?

278
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,666
[gasps] That thing?

279
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,208
[JULIUS] According to our
captives, they call the gems

280
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:27,208
embedded in that
tablet "magic stones."

281
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:29,250
They believe that gathering
them all will allow them

282
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:32,500
to be reborn into their
"true forms" with close ties

283
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:35,625
to the mana, thereby
granting them immense power.

284
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,541
Apparently, that was the reason
they targeted Fuegoleon.

285
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:40,958
Because of the
magic stone he wore.

286
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:44,125
They think they're
gonna be reborn?

287
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:45,291
You sure they
haven't been readin'

288
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:47,458
too many of those
fantasy novels?

289
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:49,333
We can't know for sure
whether it's true,

290
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:51,416
but their belief is very real,
and that's enough

291
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,250
to convince me that
we must keep them from

292
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:54,833
getting the stones at all costs.

293
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:56,791
Uh-huh, uh-huh. And?

294
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:59,000
Four stones remain
to be gathered.

295
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:00,375
And from what our captives said,

296
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:02,708
it seems they know the
location of one of them.

297
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:05,375
[YAMI]
Hm. Where's that?

298
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:07,083
[JULIUS]
The Underwater Temple,

299
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:09,041
one of the "strong
magic regions."

300
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:12,208
That makes sense.
Oh, yeah, of course.

301
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:14,583
What are those again?

302
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:16,375
If you're not actually
gonna use this thing,

303
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,375
I'll go ahead and
crush it for ya.

304
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,083
[JULIUS chuckles]

305
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:21,958
Strong magic regions.

306
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:25,625
As the name suggests, they're
areas of great magic power.

307
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,750
Various magic phenomena
in these places

308
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:29,625
make them difficult to access.

309
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:32,416
One such region, an
especially hazardous one,

310
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,458
is known as the
Underwater Temple.

311
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:36,333
You can think of the dungeon
you and your colleagues

312
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,208
conquered before as
the beginner's version

313
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:39,250
of this place.

314
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:40,625
[gasps]

315
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:44,125
[ASTA] You mean...
it's even more dangerous?

So, we have to get

That's right and I

found in the Black Bulls,

who are unique among
the Magic Knights because

among the Magic Knights.

Not yet, I'm not done!

471
00:23:31,958 --> 00:23:33,458
Go right! Counterattack!

472
00:23:33,541 --> 00:23:34,541
Yeah, gotcha!

473
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:36,166
Now left!

474
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:38,750
Why, you!

475
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:40,291
How 'bout we put
the controllers down

476
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:41,750
and have a real battle?

477
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:44,666
[ASTA]
I don't want a game over!

478
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:47,583
[NOELLE]
What should I do?

479
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:49,708
If we're going to the beach,
I'll need a swimsuit.

480
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:51,625
I have to buy a new one.

481
00:23:51,708 --> 00:23:53,833
I wonder what kind Asta likes.

482
00:23:53,916 --> 00:23:56,958
<i>Black Clover</i> , Page 40:
"A Black Beach Story."

483
00:23:57,041 --> 00:23:58,041
Wait, what am I saying?

484
00:23:58,125 --> 00:24:00,750
I don't care what
Dorksta thinks!
