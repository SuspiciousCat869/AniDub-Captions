We still don't have a grip
on the situation, and besides,

can't even detect magic power?

It may chafe taking

Still, we must act now.

33
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:40,291
I'll go after Leo and
the Black Bull boy,

34
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:43,083
and then once I've secured them,
we'll head to the north.

Let's hurry!
