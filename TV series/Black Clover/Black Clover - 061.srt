I heard she died a while back.

That is her. No doubt.

But wait. Is she casting
a Transformation spell?

No, there'd be nothing
to gain from that.

00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:36,541
The spell is emanating
from that strange eye.

She's my dear friend,

She's dear to you? Okay.

If that's the case,

I promise I will.

322
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:29,333
[ELVES groaning]

323
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:30,916
He did this.

324
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,041
He's the only one
who knows this place!

325
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:36,250
I knew it! That human
betrayed all of us--

326
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:40,625
[screams]

327
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:43,583
Now that I've found you
again in the outside world,

328
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:46,916
let's keep our promise! Okay?

329
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,958
Someday, we'll see the world.

330
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:51,458
Let us explore together!

331
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,041
[gasps]

332
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:28,958
We said we would, so let's go.

333
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:36,125
Right. Fana.

334
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:37,875
What's wrong?

335
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,291
Well, that's a relief.

336
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,416
Yeah, I'm glad.

337
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,916
[FINRAL]
Lucky!

338
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:41,791
[FULL CAST]
Clover Clips!

339
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,916
[MARS]
"Leave it to Mars."

340
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:48,666
By the way, Mars.

341
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:51,416
How's your life been going
since you defeated me?

342
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,041
[grunts]

343
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:58,541
I still feel really bad
about that. [clears throat]

344
00:22:58,625 --> 00:23:01,041
[MARS]
Ta-dah! Look at this grimoire!

345
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:04,041
That's odd. Looks
half like mine.

346
00:23:04,125 --> 00:23:05,458
Right!

347
00:23:05,541 --> 00:23:07,625
That's because it's been
imbued with your magic power!

348
00:23:07,708 --> 00:23:09,625
That way you're always with me!

349
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:11,916
Wow. That's creepy.

350
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,291
[grunts]

351
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:17,458
[MARS] Well, it was made
by Morris, the mage scholar.

352
00:23:17,541 --> 00:23:20,583
He wiped my memories
and modified my body.

353
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:23,791
So I was forced to
fight who I was told.

354
00:23:23,875 --> 00:23:27,833
But battling Asta in that
dungeon made me remember!

355
00:23:27,916 --> 00:23:29,333
And here's the best part!

356
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:30,666
In an effort to
make it up to you,

357
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,958
I always found a way
to secretly help people

358
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:35,458
during my missions! Nice, right?

359
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:38,333
Yes. Good boy!

360
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:41,291
You still hurt me,
but, good boy!

361
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:44,125
[groans]

362
00:23:46,541 --> 00:23:48,708
[FINRAL]
I'm so jealous I can't stand it!

363
00:23:48,791 --> 00:23:51,250
But since I'm his elder, I'll
take the high road on this one.

364
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:52,958
Uh, I am older than him, right?

365
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:56,375
Anyway, congrats to Mars
and Fana. I guess.

367

Nope, still jealous!
