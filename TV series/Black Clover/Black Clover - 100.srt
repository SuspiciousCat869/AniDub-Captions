took up the fight.

00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:45,577
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

and his story became legend.

[FINRAL] Captain Vangeance
of the Golden Dawn?

That's right.

00:02:26,302 --> 00:02:29,347
He and Licht were sharing the
same body and nobody knew.

10

What? How does that even happen?

11

Somethin' like that.

How should I know?

46

I just got done visiting

you would be crying your

there are different souls

161
00:10:43,133 --> 00:10:45,010
moving within their bodies.

162
00:10:45,093 --> 00:10:46,261
Klaus and Hamon as we know them

163
00:10:46,344 --> 00:10:49,180
are lying dormant
somewhere on the inside.

164
00:10:49,264 --> 00:10:50,724
Whoa, really?

165
00:10:50,807 --> 00:10:52,559
So, how are we gonna
bring 'em back?

166
00:10:52,642 --> 00:10:56,187
Um, Thank you so much
for rescuing me, Asta.

167
00:10:56,271 --> 00:10:58,732
[YUNO]
And, inside my body...

168
00:10:58,815 --> 00:11:01,276
What's up?

169
00:11:01,359 --> 00:11:02,986
[YUNO]
Still!

170
00:11:03,069 --> 00:11:04,904
I am Yuno, one of
the Magic Knights

171
00:11:04,988 --> 00:11:10,035
of the Clover Kingdom!
And no one else!

172
00:11:10,118 --> 00:11:11,411
[KLAUS]
This is a shame.

173
00:11:11,494 --> 00:11:14,080
That human vessel
is awfully stubborn.

174
00:11:14,164 --> 00:11:17,959
It's clear now. He
hasn't fully awakened.

175
00:11:18,043 --> 00:11:20,378
The humans have tainted him!

176
00:11:20,462 --> 00:11:23,548
Very well, we'll slay
those vermin behind you

177
00:11:23,631 --> 00:11:25,842
and exorcise you from that body!

178
00:11:32,682 --> 00:11:34,476
What?

179
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:38,229
[YUNO] Those bodies
belong to my squadmates.

180
00:11:38,313 --> 00:11:41,066
Leave them now, or I
will force you out!

181
00:11:44,944 --> 00:11:47,739
Well, if this is the
way you want to behave.

182
00:11:49,199 --> 00:11:51,242
You've left us no choice!

183
00:11:52,243 --> 00:11:53,536
[ASTA]
Whoa!

184
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:56,081
They're makin' the room shake
just by glarin' at us!

185
00:11:56,164 --> 00:11:57,832
Not good!

186
00:11:57,916 --> 00:12:00,377
I know I can't fix this.

187
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,671
But I can stun and capture them.

188
00:12:02,754 --> 00:12:07,008
I'll stop them.
You and Mimosa stand back.

189
00:12:11,137 --> 00:12:14,974
[ASTA laughs]

190
00:12:15,058 --> 00:12:16,476
[MIMOSA]
Um, Asta?

191
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:18,311
[ASTA laughing]

192
00:12:18,395 --> 00:12:22,148
Yeah, right! I want
in on this, too!

193
00:12:22,232 --> 00:12:24,150
Save some fun for me!

194
00:12:24,234 --> 00:12:26,194
Yuno doesn't need you, Shorty!

195
00:12:26,277 --> 00:12:27,696
He's got me with him!

196
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:29,030
Mimosa!

197
00:12:29,114 --> 00:12:31,616
Could you give us a little
extra room to work here?

198
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,159
Okay!

199
00:12:33,243 --> 00:12:36,162
[KLAUS] With new developments
and improved grimoires,

200
00:12:36,246 --> 00:12:37,956
magic is significantly
more refined

201
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:40,458
than it was during our time!

202
00:12:40,542 --> 00:12:43,420
I agree.

203
00:12:43,503 --> 00:12:47,841
[KLAUS, HAMON] Combo Magic:
Le Château de Verre!

204
00:12:49,634 --> 00:12:51,344
[KLAUS]
You're finished.

205
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:56,516
Man! That is a
tough-lookin' spell!

206
00:12:56,599 --> 00:12:58,476
You're not scared, right?

207
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,729
Their power is outrageous.

208
00:13:00,812 --> 00:13:04,107
I can't protect us both
this time. Good luck.

209
00:13:05,817 --> 00:13:07,777
[ASTA, YUNO]
Here we go!

210
00:13:12,866 --> 00:13:15,452
[BOTH]
Onward, Le Château de Verre!

211
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:23,793
[YUNO]
It's over!

212
00:13:23,877 --> 00:13:25,879
[ASTA]
You're goin' down!

213
00:13:34,304 --> 00:13:38,683
[BOTH yelling]

214
00:13:59,037 --> 00:14:01,581
Wow, that was amazing, you two!

215
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:06,878
[RHYA] The anti-magic
brat's enough of a pain,

216
00:14:06,961 --> 00:14:09,506
but now this one gets the
magic boost from reincarnation,

217
00:14:09,589 --> 00:14:12,092
even though he's not
completely awakened yet?

218
00:14:21,476 --> 00:14:23,311
[gasps]

219
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:24,813
[RHYA]
Licht...

220
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,360
[YUNO]
He should be out of power.

221
00:14:30,443 --> 00:14:33,405
How's he able to
make things levitate?

222
00:14:33,488 --> 00:14:37,701
The mana's extremely dense.
This is impossible!

223
00:14:47,043 --> 00:14:49,295
Now we have to
defeat their leader?

224
00:14:49,379 --> 00:14:51,339
What's with the sword?

225
00:14:54,467 --> 00:14:56,011
[ASTA]
Nero?

226
00:14:56,094 --> 00:14:59,431
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, cut
that out, it really hurts!

227
00:14:59,514 --> 00:15:01,224
Ow, now is not the time!

228
00:15:12,152 --> 00:15:13,903
[ASTA]
His ki...

229
00:15:13,987 --> 00:15:16,406
[YUNO]
That sword's got massive power!

230
00:15:16,489 --> 00:15:20,118
[ASTA] Uh-oh. I can't stay
in this form much longer.

231
00:15:20,201 --> 00:15:22,495
Come on, just a little more!

232
00:15:22,579 --> 00:15:24,914
Asta. Careful, all right?

233
00:15:24,998 --> 00:15:27,417
Yeah. I know that...

234
00:15:30,837 --> 00:15:31,963
[ASTA]
He's fast!

235
00:15:32,047 --> 00:15:34,549
No, it's more like he's
melted into the air.

236
00:15:34,632 --> 00:15:36,343
I can't read his ki now!

237
00:15:36,426 --> 00:15:38,553
[YUNO]
Why can't I pick up his mana?

238
00:15:38,636 --> 00:15:39,596
Did he somehow become

239
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:42,307
one with the natural
mana around him?

240
00:15:48,396 --> 00:15:49,773
[ASTA gasps]

241
00:15:53,234 --> 00:15:54,402
[YUNO]
Asta!

242
00:16:25,433 --> 00:16:26,685
[ASTA yells]

[MIMOSA grunting]

[YUNO] Wind Spirit Binding
Magic: Liable Tempest!

245
00:16:46,496 --> 00:16:47,706
Please don't miss.

246
00:16:47,789 --> 00:16:50,083
Where did all that
confidence go?

247
00:16:53,795 --> 00:16:55,714
[ASTA]
Got 'im!

248
00:16:55,797 --> 00:16:56,965
Asta! Look out!

[ASTA yelps]

00:17:19,904 --> 00:17:21,364
[ASTA yelps]

251
00:17:23,783 --> 00:17:26,327
[YUNO] He's casting Fast
Movement. Now what?

252
00:17:26,411 --> 00:17:28,872
This is where we push
past our limits!

253
00:17:28,955 --> 00:17:30,498
That's your big plan?

254
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:31,541

[yells]

258
00:18:18,463 --> 00:18:20,715
[YUNO] It's drawing
my magic towards it!

259
00:18:22,592 --> 00:18:25,011
[RHYA] That's just one
of the fun little perks

260
00:18:25,095 --> 00:18:28,056
that comes with the original
demon-dweller sword.

261
00:18:31,685 --> 00:18:32,686
[yelps]

262
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,871
[ASTA]
This guy is strong.

263
00:18:51,955 --> 00:18:54,374
And what the heck did
he do to my sword?

264
00:18:54,457 --> 00:18:57,335
I don't know what's
goin' on anymore!

265
00:18:57,419 --> 00:18:58,962
I hate this!

266
00:18:59,045 --> 00:19:03,216
Come on, body, you can't
give out on me, not now!

267
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:06,344
[RHYA] That runt should be
reaching his limit any second.

268
00:19:06,428 --> 00:19:07,762
I'm pretty worn out myself.

269
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:10,306
But hey, good job
gettin' this far.

270
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:14,060
[MIMOSA]
Asta. Yuno!

271
00:19:14,144 --> 00:19:18,023
I can't heal them
right now. My magic is...

272
00:19:23,069 --> 00:19:25,363
[YUNO]
I can't find an opening!

273
00:19:25,447 --> 00:19:27,449
Time to change my approach.

274
00:19:33,288 --> 00:19:34,706
[yells]

275
00:19:42,464 --> 00:19:43,506
[YUNO]
Not yet.

276
00:19:51,264 --> 00:19:52,599
[YUNO]
Not yet.

277
00:19:55,352 --> 00:19:57,645
[YUNO]
Not yet!

278
00:19:57,729 --> 00:20:00,857
[RHYA] I'm surprised he can
handle attacks that fast.

279
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,275
Nice moves.

280
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:04,778
[YUNO]
Not yet!

281
00:20:04,861 --> 00:20:07,947
All right. My turn!

[RHYA] That's what
that fire chick used!

284
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:13,995
Watch out!

285
00:20:18,249 --> 00:20:20,502
[YUNO]
Spirit Storm!

286
00:20:27,884 --> 00:20:29,094
[laughs]

287
00:20:29,177 --> 00:20:30,720
[RHYA] Look at that,
he's only partway through

288
00:20:30,804 --> 00:20:33,014
the reincarnation process
and he still managed

289
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:34,599
to catch him off guard.

290
00:20:34,683 --> 00:20:37,644
Well, I guess he
and Licht are...

291
00:20:42,524 --> 00:20:44,317
[gasps]

292
00:20:44,401 --> 00:20:46,945
[RHYA] Wait. I thought
he couldn't move?

293
00:20:49,906 --> 00:20:53,702
[YUNO] This is it. Asta's
pushing past his limits!

294
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:55,995
I'm not done yet!

295
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:58,998
[RHYA] The timing's perfect,
like they planned it that way!

296
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:02,460
[RHYA]
Who <i>are</i> these two?

297
00:21:02,544 --> 00:21:05,088
You're not killin' Yuno!

298
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:09,050
Or Asta, either!

299
00:21:10,176 --> 00:21:13,388
[ASTA, YUNO]
He's my rival!

300
00:21:21,604 --> 00:21:24,816
[ASTA gasps]
He blocked it with that sword?

301
00:21:28,945 --> 00:21:31,281
[YUNO] He's condensing
a huge amount of magic!

302
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:44,169
Is this Yuno's spell?

00:23:59,387 --> 00:24:00,972
He's so powerful!

307
00:24:01,056 --> 00:24:03,391
But I promised Zora I
would make it back alive.

308
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:05,226
And besides,
Yuno's here with me!
