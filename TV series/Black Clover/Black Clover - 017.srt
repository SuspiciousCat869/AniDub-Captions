1
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,583
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:15,666 --> 00:00:18,750
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,666
[NARRATOR] All seemed
lost until a lone mage

4
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,375
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,583
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:39,958
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,791
[LOTUS] Well, this isn't
a good turn of events.

8
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:45,125
If that's how it's going to be,

9
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:47,750
I suppose it's time
to get serious.

10
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:54,291
[LOTUS]
Smoke Creation Magic:

11
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:57,833
Prison of the Fallen King!

12
00:00:57,916 --> 00:01:00,041
Poor, foolish little children.

13
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:02,333
[ASTA] The thing about
the Black Bulls is

14
00:01:02,416 --> 00:01:05,291
we don't lose to anyone,
and that includes you!

15
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:06,583
Got it?

16
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:09,125
Time to go. This ends now.

17
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:10,666
What are you...?

18
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:15,041
[YUNO]
Wind Creation Magic:

19
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:19,250
Engaging Swift White Hawk,
paired with Wind Blade Shower.

20
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:21,458
[KLAUS]
He's performing a dual-casting?

21
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:23,833
Time to get out of
our way, Diamond mage.

22
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:26,791
The Golden Dawn will
reach the hall first.

23
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:33,916
[yelling]

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,083
Here!

25
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:42,958
[yelps]

26
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:44,875
[coughs]

27
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:47,000
Anyone else feeling kinda dizzy?

28
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:49,208
[NOELLE] This place is
filling up with smoke.

29
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:51,750
We'll wind up
suffocating at this rate.

30
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:55,875
Our only chance is to defeat
the spellcaster, and fast!

31
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:58,041
[LUCK]
I can sense his magic power,

32
00:01:58,125 --> 00:02:00,750
so I have a good idea
of where he might be.

33
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:03,416
If we attack, he'll
most likely dodge it.

34
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,791
What do I know about his
fighting style so far?

35
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:11,458
[LUCK] When he's inside the
smoke, he can move really fast,

36
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:15,750
and he can pick up on
magic power quickly, too.

37
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:19,458
Our best shot is to find
a way to blindside him.

38
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:21,666
But how, when he can
sense our magic?

39
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,625
[ASTA yells]

40
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:27,958
I can sense your magic power,

41
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:30,833
so sneak attacks aren't
going to work on me.

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,916
Whoa, there! Wow, rapid-fire!

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,041
Getting desperate, are we?

44
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm afraid you won't be
able to hit me like that.

45
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:48,166
It won't clear
the smoke, either.

46
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,500
I suppose it all comes
down to experience.

47
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:53,416
I've likely been in more battles
than all of you combined.

48
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,041
[yelps]

49
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:56,875
[groans]

50
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:59,416
[ASTA growls, yells]

51
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:03,250
[LOTUS groans]

52
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,625
[NOELLE]
That went really well.

53
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:10,291
You know, you were
right earlier.

54
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:12,416
Teamwork is vital.

55
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:52,500
[LOTUS] Oh, dear.
What have you done to me?

56
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:55,375
Feeble old man that I am.

57
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:58,833
[LOTUS]
Well, that's not good.

58
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:01,208
Arm appears to be broken.

59
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:04,041
Along with a handful
of ribs, I'd imagine.

60
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:10,291
[LOTUS] I'm in no shape
to fight like this. Hm.

61
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:11,958
The Clover Kingdom
sure does have

62
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:16,666
some rare gems. Take this
diamond in the rough.

63
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:21,083
A magicless lad wielding
an enormous blade.

64
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:23,125
Even with my
considerable experience,

65
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:26,541
I've never met anyone on the
battlefield who lacked magic.

66
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,958
[LOTUS] If I'm going
to be taken prisoner...

67
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:36,541
...I'd rather die.

68
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:46,500
[LOTUS]
Or just run away.

69
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:47,791
Hey, get back here!

70
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:50,291
Wait up, Asta!

71
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:52,041
You're not getting away.

72
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:08,416
Yes, my handy
Smoke Creation Magic.

73
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,250
Nothing like a ride in
the Hustling Lazy Car.

74
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:16,125
[LUCK]
Hah! I'm right on your tail.

75
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:18,291
[laughs]

76
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:19,791
[LUCK]
Whoa!

77
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,375
[LUCK]
Aw.

78
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:32,083
We lost him, huh? Stupid smoke!

79
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:37,958
[panting] You guys...
are way too fast.

80
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:39,333
Man. That's too bad.

81
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:40,958
I was really looking forward
to finishing the fight

82
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:42,333
with that old guy.

83
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:44,125
But that's not
the mission, right?

84
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:46,333
Let's forget him and get
to the treasure hall.

85
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:48,125
Wait, you're turning
down a fight?

86
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,625
[ASTA]
Yeah, let's get movin'!

87
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:51,416
There's treasure to find!

88
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:55,250
[gasps]

89
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,583
[LUCK]
Oh, wow. So much magic power.

90
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:04,125
That guy was strong.

91
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:05,166
But there's someone here

92
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,875
who can give him
a run for his money.

93
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:09,625
[LOTUS]
Everyone doing all right?

94
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:11,041
At this rate,
we're going to have to

95
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:13,208
forego the treasure hall.

96
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:16,916
[grunts]
Well, I'm sure Mars

97
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,625
is capable of
handling it without me.

98
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:21,208
Let's not forget,

99
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:24,125
he is the Diamond Kingdom's
secret weapon.

100
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:31,166
[panting]

101
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,500
[KLAUS] Such frighteningly
sinister magic.

102
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:39,875
Yuno's using all his strength,
and yet, he's helpless.

103
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,708
[KLAUS]
Those embedded gemstones.

104
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:48,166
I've heard of them!

105
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:52,166
[KLAUS] There have been rumors
that the Diamond Kingdom

106
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:55,083
has been experimentally
cultivating mages

107
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:57,958
who have artificially
enhanced magic power.

108
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:01,166
[KLAUS] They select
children gifted in magic

109
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:05,208
from a young age, subject
them to fierce competition,

110
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:09,041
and embed magic-heightening
items into their bodies.

111
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:15,375
[KLAUS] In the end, they must
fight one another to the death.

112
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:18,708
The lone survivor of
that deadly free-for-all...

113
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,583
[KLAUS]
Is that... him?

114
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:29,583
[KLAUS] Whoever he is,
this situation is dire.

115
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,708
How can this be happening?

116
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,875
I am of the nobility.

117
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:36,708
A member of the
elite Golden Dawn!

118
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:40,958
[KLAUS] One ally has
already fallen to him.

119
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:43,666
And a commoner is protecting me.

120
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:47,083
[growls]
This is unacceptable.

121
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:49,375
I will not allow this
travesty to continue.

122
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:52,125
Now! Steel Creation Magic:

123
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:54,916
Spiral Lance!

124
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,375
Wait, Klaus, sir!

125
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:10,625
[KLAUS gasps]
A mineral clone?

126
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:18,041
[gasps]

127
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,791
Too close!

128
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:48,875
[sputters]

129
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:26,375
[MARS] Such pitiful magic.
It won't work on me.

130
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:29,458
[YUNO grunts]

131
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,083
[YUNO grunts]

132
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:49,208
It's no use.

133
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:50,666
[YUNO grunts]

134
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:55,541
[yells]

135
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:03,458
[MARS]
I'm telling you, it's no use.

136
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:06,541
[YUNO]
It's no use.

137
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:09,416
Let's just forget
about training. Okay?

138
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,666
I'm not done yet!

139
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,666
Not until I land a hit on you.

140
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,833
No way am I gonna quit now!

141
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:20,750
[yells]

142
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:24,791
[ASTA yelling]

143
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,666
[YUNO]
Asta...

144
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:31,041
[ASTA]
Not yet. I'm not done!

145
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:33,625
--C'mon, can't we just--
--[ASTA] No way!

146
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:37,125
I am never, ever,
going to give up!

147
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,291
[yells]

148
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:46,458
Stop your pointless posturing.

149
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:47,916
I won't.

150
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:51,083
[MARS]
Move.

151
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:52,541
I won't.

152
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,250
[MARS]
Give up.

153
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:00,375
[YUNO]
I will not.

154
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:05,666
[YUNO yells]

155
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:11,333
Yuno!

156
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:19,833
[ASTA yells]

157
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:39,208
[ASTA] Hey, you.
Freaky-lookin' pale dude.

158
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:42,583
Keep your hands off this guy.

159
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:46,125
Yuno's not yours to fight.

160
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:47,875
He's my rival.

161
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,875

I finally catch up to you,

away from being killed!

Yet, his incredible power

And what is it to you if I did?

It is the strong who remain,

But a commoner like him
is beneath a power like that.

Perhaps he was just lucky to
be endowed with such a skill.
