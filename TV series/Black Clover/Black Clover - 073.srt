1
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:15,708
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:18,541
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:24,416
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,166
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,541
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:39,750
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:43,750
[NARRATOR]
At the end of the Star Festival,

8
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:46,041
King Clover made a
momentous announcement.

9
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:48,875
We have located the
Midnight Sun's hideout.

10
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:50,083
You will be pleased to know that

11
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:51,791
we're preparing to
launch a full-scale

12
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:53,291
counterattack of our own.

13
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:55,708
And to do so, we plan
to gather the absolute

14
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:58,041
cream-of-the-crop from
our Magic Knight squads.

15
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:01,958
Allowing us to assemble the
most elite team imaginable!

16
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:06,000
And that unit will be
called the Royal Knights!

17
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:08,583
[NARRATOR] The time has come
for all of the Magic Knights

18
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:11,125
to face the test that will
determine their eligibility

19
00:01:11,208 --> 00:01:13,833
to join the kingdom's
most select team.

20
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:46,583
[XERX]
What a hassle.

21
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:47,875
And right when I
finally get back

22
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:49,958
from my expedition, too.

23
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:52,833
You're on the verge of
obstructing official business.

24
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:56,250
As a Magic Knight, I'll be
forced to punish you for that.

25
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:58,458
[XERX'S BODYGUARD] Do you
have any idea who this is?

26
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:00,625
You're in the presence
of Xerx Lugner,

27
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:03,291
Vice-Captain of
the Purple Orcas!

28
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:05,541
If it weren't for this
man's strength and virtue,

29
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:08,500
the Purple Orcas could never
have accomplished as much!

30
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:10,333
He is the Saint of Pure Ice!

31
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:13,000
[ZORA] What would I know
about that, fancy-pants?

32
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:17,250
Saint of Pure Ice? I don't
see any ice around here.

33
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:19,791
If you ask me, he should
be the Saint of Carcasses

34
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:20,833
Rotting in the Mud.

35
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:22,250
How dare you!

36
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:23,541
[ZORA]
And you.

37
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,416
Why are you singing
his praises as though

38
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,125
you're some kind of
pathetic little lap dog?

39
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,416
What's the matter?

40
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,000
Is your master too stupid
to introduce himself

41
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:32,916
without your help?

42
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,916
Ah--

43
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,708
Official business, you said?

44
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:39,625
You bigwigs sure
have it made, dontcha?

45
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:41,791
Using pretty words
to control anybody

46
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:44,916
who's unlucky enough to
rub you the wrong way.

47
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,291
Go ahead, be my guest.

48
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:49,125
Use that magic
you're so proud of

49
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:51,875
and teach me a
lesson for justice.

50
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:53,500
We know you're itching
for a power trip,

51
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:56,166
Mr. Vice-Captain
of the goon squad.

52
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,333
I've heard quite enough!

53
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:00,708
Words of contempt for
the Magic Knights?

54
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:04,666
I won't have it! Now,
taste my magic and repent!

55
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,625
Ice Magic: Ice Slicer!

56
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:14,125
[XERX'S BODYGUARD yelps]

57
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:20,750
That was the Saint
of Pure Ice? Sad.

58
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:24,125
[ZORA]
Poor guy must be crushed.

59
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:27,541
I bet it stings to lose
to someone like me.

60
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,333
[screams]

61
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:33,791
[XERX grunts]

62
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:37,083
[ZORA] This Magic Knight robe
is wasted on a wuss like you.

63
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:39,583
[ZORA]
Now then.

64
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:42,750
I wonder if anyone else
needs an ego check?

65
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,958
It's the big
Royal Knights exam!

66
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:55,000
I don't know what to expect,
but whatever it is,

67
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,125
I'll be ready!

68
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:57,750
Finally, a chance
to show the kingdom

69
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:59,041
what I can really do!

70
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:01,000
[gasps]

71
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:02,458
Oh, dear.

72
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:04,166
I know you're excited, sir,
but even that small amount

73
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,416
of power can be a problem
for the people around you.

74
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,791
Do you think you could
be a little less

75
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:10,416
enthusiastic, please?

76
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,250
[WINSTON]
Er. I'm sorry.

77
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:14,833
[MAGIC KNIGHT 73A]
That's Mimosa Vermillion!

78
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:17,541
She's always been good at
recovery and support spells,

79
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:20,833
but I hear she's picked up a
few offensive techniques, too!

80
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:22,750
[MAGIC KNIGHT 73B]
She's really talented!

81
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:24,958
That's royalty, I guess!

82
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:27,500
[KLAUS] Mimosa, please try
not to stir up trouble

83
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:29,291
before the exam starts.

84
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:30,541
That Knight was older than you,

85
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,666
and you had the audacity
to tell him that?

86
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,000
You can be blunt to the point
of being rude sometimes.

87
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:36,916
And you're a
bespectacled worrywart,

88
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,750
so I don't think you have
much room to criticize.

89
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:40,541
Come on, now!

90
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:42,208
[MAGIC KNIGHT 73A]
And there's Klaus Lunettes!

91
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,500
He's gotten a lot more powerful
these past few months.

92
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:47,083
The guy's Steel Magic is
practically unstoppable!

93
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:50,583
Not to mention all the strength
training he's been up to.

94
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:52,041
[MAGIC KNIGHT 73B]
Wow, look over there!

95
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:53,875
It's this year's top newcomer.

96
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:55,958
The Wind spirit master, Yuno!

97
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:57,208
I'm so mad!

98
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,000
You promised you'd take
me out on a date today!

99
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:01,000
Don't tell me you
don't remember!

100
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:02,625
I promised nothing of the sort.

101
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:04,083
Are you kidding me?

102
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:05,708
All right, then tell me
we'll go out tomorrow

103
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:07,333
and I might be willing
to forgive you!

104
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:08,583
Nope, can't.

105
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,041
Aw, then we'd better go
the day after tomorrow,

106
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:11,541
and make it somewhere fancy!

107
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:13,791
I can't make plans
that far ahead.

108
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,750
Yuno! Don't be such a meanie!

109
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:20,000
All right, that's it, I'm gonna
have to mess up your hair!

110
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:23,375
[laughs] This is
quite a lively scene,

111
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:25,000
don't you think, Alecdora?

112
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:26,583
I suppose.

113
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:29,625
[MAGIC KNIGHT 73C] Oh man, this
place is full of heavy-hitters!

114
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:31,375
[MAGIC KNIGHT 73D]
Yeah! I betcha several members

115
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,833
of the Golden Dawn are
gonna make the final cut!

116
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:36,833
The tension in the
air here is so thick,

117
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:38,750
you could almost cut
through it with a knife!

118
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:42,833
It'd be best if everyone relaxed
and went with the flow.

119
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:45,166
I don't know. I think
you might be too relaxed.

120
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,416
[ASTA]
Hey! Look!

121
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,208
It's Klaus and Mimosa!
Long time no see, guys!

122
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:51,291
Oh! Hello there, Asta!

123
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:52,666
What a surprise!

124
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,916
I should warn you,
I've been training.

125
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,708
I'm stronger now, so it
won't be easy to beat me!

126
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:01,541
That's awesome!
Woo, now I'm pumped!

127
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:03,625
[MIMOSA]
Um. Let's try our hardest today.

128
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:04,833
May the best knights win!

129
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:06,083
Heck yeah!

130
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:08,333
Hey, hold on a second.
Your face is all red.

131
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:09,583
You feelin' okay?

132
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:10,833
Oh, yes, I'm totally fine,

133
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:12,541
thank you so much
for asking though!

134
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:15,458
[MIMOSA] I haven't been this
nervous in a really long time!

135
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:17,583
Well, it looks like you're
as loud as ever today.

136
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:19,000
What's up, Yuno?

137
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:21,458
That hot spring trip sure was
a lot of fun, wasn't it?

138
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:22,458
Uh-huh.

139
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:23,958
Did you say hot spring?

140
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:26,458
I don't remember you mentioning
anything like that.

141
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:29,083
I mighta lost the race
to the top of the volcano,

142
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:31,250
but I'm not losin'
anything today, got that?

143
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:32,833
I hope you did
some mental training

144
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:35,333
for when you fail.
Don't want you to cry.

145
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:37,125
I won't!

146
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:40,125
Wait, you still haven't told me
about the hot spring, Yuno.

147
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:42,000
[chuckles] Seems like
you're pretty excited

148
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,791
about this whole thing.

149
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:45,750
You, too, Asta.

150
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,666
Won't somebody please explain?

151
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:52,541
[LEOPOLD laughs] Asta! Yuno!
You can't forget about me!

00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:53,791
[ASTA]
Leo!

153
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:56,625
Watch me. I'm gonna ace
this Royal Knights exam!

00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:58,041
--No, I am!
--[YUNO] You wish.

Y'wanna fight about it?

156
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,875
[MIMOSA]
But what about the hot spring?!

157
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:05,500
Oh, boy. I'm so
nervous right now!

158
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:08,875
But, hey, I guess all we can do
is give it our best shot, right?

159
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:10,416
Listen up, poser.

160
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,916
Did I give you permission to
wear that Black Bulls robe?

161
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,916
Just who do you think
you are, anyway?

162
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,916
Probably a fan of ours.
Do you wanna spar with me?

163
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,291
Stop it. I'm Finral! See?

164
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,375
I wanted a confidence
boost before the exam,

165
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:25,750
so I changed my hairstyle.

166
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,166
A new look, huh?

167
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,708
There must be something dramatic
going on with you, then.

168
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,500
What's the matter?
You get your heart broken

169
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:32,875
into teeny little pieces?

170
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,000
Of course not.

171
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:35,500
You're right, that's silly.

172
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,583
If you changed your hair every
time a woman rejected you,

173
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:39,041
there wouldn't be any
hair left on your head

174
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:40,375
for me to cut, now would there?

175
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:42,041
That's uncalled for.

176
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:45,875
A-hem. Actually, I was trying
to psych myself up a little.

177
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,083
Say no more!

178
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:48,375
Trust me, I have just the thing,

179
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:50,333
so you can sit back and
let me work my magic!

180
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:51,750
Whoa, wait a sec.

181
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:54,166
I wasn't expecting
heavy artillery!

182
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,583
Anyway, I've got a new
'do and a new attitude

183
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,416
to match it, so you'd
best watch yourself!

184
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,541
That good-for-nothin'
Finral would never

185
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:01,916
come out to a
competition like this!

186
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,208
How dare you say
something so mean about me

187
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,416
when you know I have
seniority over you!

188
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,541
Cut it out, any idiot could
see that this is Finral!

189
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,666
There's no reason for you
to pick on him like that!

190
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,416
Aw, thank you, Asta!

191
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,375
Your hair does look
pretty tacky, though.

192
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,125
Yeah, "tacky" is a
good word for it.

193
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:20,250
I mean, not only the hair
itself, but the idea of gettin'

194
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,666
a haircut to feel better
might be the tackiest ever.

195
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,166
Yep, totally tacky.

196
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,125
And even if it did work,
I can't think of anything

197
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,791
that screams "hey,
look at me, I'm insecure"

198
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,125
like bright green frosted tips.

199
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:30,875
You guys are just
jealous because I have

200
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:32,791
a unique hairstyle that shows
off my fun personality!

201
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,708
[NOELLE] Ugh, I wish
those dorks would shut up.

202
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:37,416
They're gonna make the
whole squad look bad!

203
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,416
[gasps] Oh, Solid, it's you.

204
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,708
Look at that.

205
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:46,166
So, you've come to
disgrace yourself again.

206
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,041
[gasps]

207
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:48,958
[SOLID]
I wish you wouldn't.

208
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:50,875
Because, when you
fail this exam,

209
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:53,208
you'll bring shame
to House Silva.

210
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:55,166
Just leave while
there's still time.

211
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,875
It'll be better for both of us.

212
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:59,250
[MEREOLEONA]
Her magic was refined

213
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,166
to an unparalleled degree.

214
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,958
It was so dignified.

215
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:07,583
But, despite your royal status,
your magic is ugly and coarse.

216
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:10,250
Work hard! Improve!

217
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:12,750
Sorry, I'm not leaving.

218
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:16,000
Now then, if you'll excuse me.

219
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:18,958
[NOELLE] That's right.
I won't be afraid anymore!

220
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:20,958
It's time for me to show
my siblings how much

221
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:23,416
I've improved since
the last time we met!

222
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,166
Heh. What a little failure.

223
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:30,291
[JULIUS] I'm glad you all
were able to attend.

224
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:34,041
Without further ado,
I'd like to commence

225
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:36,583
with the Royal Knights
Selection Test.

226
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:41,791
Allow me to explain
the test in detail.

227
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,125
After all, the Royal Knights

228
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:46,333
will be my warriors,
will they not?

229
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:48,333
[KING CLOVER] This is a chance
to brandish my authority

230
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:51,791
and gain the affection
of my people!

231
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:56,750
[KING CLOVER] Now, this event
is a competition of teams!

232
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,125
And it shall be called

233
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:00,708
the "Magic Crystal Destruction
Battle Tournament"!

234
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:04,416
They're putting us on teams?

235
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,666
There's a crystal?

236
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,166
Yeah, but what are the rules?

237
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:10,250
Huh? I thought for sure it'd
be every man for himself!

238
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:13,083
I hope this doesn't turn
out to be complicated.

239
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:15,083
The rules are very simple.

240
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:16,958
Whichever team is
successful in destroying

241
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:18,500
the opposing team's crystal

242
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:20,750
while simultaneously
protecting their own crystal

243
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:23,833
from being crushed, will
be considered victorious.

244
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,750
Hey, that does
sound pretty easy!

245
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:27,125
I should be just fine!

246
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:28,833
[KING CLOVER] If both of
the crystals remain intact

247
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:30,708
at the end of the
30-minute time limit,

248
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,791
then the team whose crystal
has taken the least

249
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:35,333
amount of damage
will be the winner.

250
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:37,958
Er, the reason we
chose this method

251
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:41,166
was because it, um, well...

252
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,583
[BELL yawns]

253
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:46,166
[KING CLOVER] That is...
I know it was something good.

254
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:49,291
[JULIUS] A-hem. When facing
the Eye of the Midnight Sun,

255
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,875
it's imperative that
members of the different

256
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:53,125
knight squads are
able to cooperate.

257
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:55,750
[KING CLOVER] He worded that
so much better than I could!

258
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:58,458
We feel a team contest
is the best way to judge

259
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:00,375
your ability to work
with others as well as

260
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:01,916
your strategic proficiency.

261
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,666
There's much more to
being a Royal Knight

262
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,083
than brute strength.

263
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:07,166
Just what I would've said!

264
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:10,250
[JULIUS] Besides, I'll get to
observe all kinds of magic,

265
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,000
not just offensive spells.

266
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:15,125
[laughs] Well,
isn't that clever!

267
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:17,500
I see. If we wanna
be successful,

268
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,083
we'll have to be able
to get along with

269
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:20,791
people from other squads.

270
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:24,208
[JULIUS] Now then, let us
reveal the team roster!

271
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:30,583
Let's see. Who am I with?

272
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,583
Oh! Sweet, I got Mimosa!

273
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:34,208
Oh, gosh, am I
seriously gonna be

274
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:35,916
on the same team as Asta?

275
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,833
I mean, any other time,
I'd be happy to spend time

276
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:39,750
with him one-on-one,
but this is an exam!

277
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,291
I'm not sure if
I can concentrate,

278
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:43,500
and I still don't know what
that hot spring thing was about!

279
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:47,666
[ASTA] 'Kay, who else?
It says Xerx Lugner.

280
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,708
Who's that?

281
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:53,208
[ZORA] So sorry I'm late
for the party, everybody.

282
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,750
But, the Wizard King's
a reasonable guy,

283
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:02,500
so I'm sure he can forgive a
little tardiness just this once.

284
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,583
Who the heck is that?

285
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:07,166
Who, me? I'm Xerx Lugner.

286
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,833
Pleasure's mine.

287
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:18,333
Who, me? I'm Xerx Lugner.

288
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:20,250
Pleasure's mine.

289
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,041
[JULIUS gasps]

290
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:23,500
You see,

291
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,500
I met this elderly woman who
was in a sticky situation.

292
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,083
Naturally, as a Magic Knight,

293
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:30,791
I had to step in and
offer my assistance.

294
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:32,000
Cut me some slack?

295
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:34,791
Oh, dear. Is that poor
woman all right now?

296
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:37,083
Of course. Fit as a fiddle.

297
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:38,625
[laughs]

298
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:40,875
Something's not right.

299
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:43,416
Stand aside, you insolent cur!

300
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,500
That's not a very warm welcome.

301
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,875
What's gotten into you
all of a sudden?

302
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:51,958
I'd like to ask you
the same question.

303
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:55,375
Xerx Lugner, you say? But he's--

304
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,583
Your Majesty.

305
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:00,250
[FRANCIS]
Hey, who do you think you are?

306
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,875
How dare you show up late
and with a rotten attitude?

307
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:04,416
The Wizard King is
one of the few men

308
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,250
Char approves of, so
you'd better back off!

309
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:09,375
Yeah, why are you acting
like such a bully?

310
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:10,791
Settle down, folks.

311
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,750
There's no need to worry.

312
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:14,291
[ZORA]
Oh, all right.

313
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:16,000
Sounds like you're
all pretty fond

314
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:17,583
of this chump, aren't you?

315
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:21,291
Sorry, but I don't really
see why he's so great.

316
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:26,583
You guys might be a
mindless mob, but, not me.

317
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:29,583
[MARX] That robe.
It's definitely Xerx's.

318
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:31,500
[JULIUS]
I'll tell you one thing, "Xerx."

319
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:32,833
You really changed
your whole look

320
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:34,333
on that long expedition.

321
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:35,500
[laughs]

322
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,291
Please don't laugh, sir!

323
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,541
It's nice to meet you, kid.

324
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,750
Apparently, we'll be
on the same team.

325
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:47,250
Let's keep things friendly.

326
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:48,791
Okay.

327
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,541
So stinky!

328
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:57,333
[ZORA laughs]
That's the smelliest insect

329
00:14:57,416 --> 00:15:00,458
in Clover Kingdom. They call
it a rainbow stinkbug.

330
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:01,791
They do?

331
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:04,458
Must be 'cuz it puts out a
rainbow of nasty smells!

332
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:07,291
Friendly, huh? Not the
best way of showin' it!

333
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:09,208
Obviously I was lying.

334
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:10,833
I can't be friends
with an annoying,

335
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:12,916
hyperactive little pipsqueak.

336
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,458
[yelps]

337
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,875
[ZORA] I mean, I can tell by
that vapid look on your face.

338
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,375
You're a complete moron.

339
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:21,125
That really does
stink, doesn't it?

340
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:23,125
[laughs]

341
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:25,791
Hey!

342
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:27,791
Who do you think you
are with that, uh,

343
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,541
that cool mouth cover thingy!

344
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:31,250
Maybe don't compliment him?

345
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:35,250
[yells] Are you even gonna
try to win this thing?

346
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,041
It looks like "trying"
is the only thing

347
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,166
you know how to do.

348
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,541
But didn't you come
here for a chance

349
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:41,000
to get into the Royal Knights?

350
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:44,583
[ZORA chuckles]
Oh, hell no.

351
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:47,500
The only reason I showed up
was to make fun of all of you.

352
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:47,958
[MAGIC KNIGHTS]
I'll punch him in the nose!

353
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,291
You what?!

354
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:51,000
I may not know
Vice Captain Xerx,

355
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,666
but I didn't think
he was like that.

356
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,041
All the rumors we heard
must have been wrong.

357
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:57,833
Everyone calls him the
Saint of Pure Ice.

358
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,916
But because he's usually
posted at the border,

359
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,500
not many have actually
laid eyes on him.

360
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:05,583
Are you sure, sir?

361
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:07,708
Yes. It might prove to be fun.

362
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,166
Ugh.

363
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,125
Look, I'm sorry, Your Majesty!

364
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:12,541
I really don't think
I can be on a team

365
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:14,208
with a big mean jerk
like this guy!

366
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:15,083
[ZORA laughs]

367
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:16,500
Now, now, you two.

368
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,916
You may be different,
but you're both Magic Knights.

369
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,333
You'll just have to get along.

370
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:21,541
Julius.

371
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:23,833
Shouldn't I get to say
something wise, too?

372
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,583
All right, everybody.

373
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:28,208
I assume you've all
identified your teammates?

374
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,041
You're kidding!

375
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,625
So I have to work
with this little punk?

376
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:36,500
I'm not "little,"
you're just giant!

377
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:37,708
Oh, that's it!

378
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:39,625
I'm snappin' those
ugly glasses in two!

379
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,125
I wish you would, freak!

380
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,750
You better watch your
mouth or I'll bury ya

381
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,000
right where you're standin'!

382
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:46,750
Hate to break it to ya.
I'm an Earth Magic user.

383
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,875
You wanna bury me,
go ahead and try it!

384
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:52,041
I swear, men are
incredibly stupid!

385
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:57,583
[YUNO] Guess I'll be
working with the fussy mage

386
00:16:57,666 --> 00:17:00,583
who's always following
Asta around.

387
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:03,625
Hah! I guess you're
a little bit pretty.

388
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:06,083
But Yuno is mine,
do you understand me?

389
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:08,375
Keep your hands off
of him or else!

390
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,500
[NOELLE] What are the odds I
would end up on the same team

391
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:13,000
as this cocky guy who
grew up with Asta?

392
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:14,875
Are you listening to me?

393
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:16,916
You just keep your
distance, all right?

394
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,666
If you ruin this
exam for my Yuno,

395
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,500
then I'm gonna make
sure you regret it!

396
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:23,125
Okay! Just leave me alone!

397
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:28,625
[KLAUS]
I don't believe this!

398
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:30,166
Am I really supposed
to be teammates

399
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,250
with Luck, the Cheery Berserker?

400
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:33,625
This should be fun!

401
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:36,250
Let's work together and
try our best to win, okay?

402
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:39,125
What? Together,
you say? I suppose--

403
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:40,666
[KLAUS grunts, yelps]

404
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:43,458
[LUCK laughs] I can already
tell you and I are gonna make

405
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,166
a really great team!

406
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,250
[BOTH laugh]

407
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:57,458
[FINRAL] Okay. He's laughing.
So's he, for some reason.

408
00:17:57,541 --> 00:18:00,750
Yeah. I don't know how
I feel about this team.

409
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:06,333
Well, I'm hardly a fan of yours,

410
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:08,375
but at least you're
reasonably capable.

411
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:11,000
Do try to refrain from
acting on your own.

412
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:12,208
Now that we have our groups,

413
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,083
let us advance to
the testing grounds.

414
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:16,125
Please, Cob. Do the honors!

415
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:19,583
Yes, of course! Yes of
coursity-course-course!

416
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:24,875
Whoa. He does Spatial Magic!

417
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:28,333
Here we go! Everybody,
step into the portal!

418
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,500
So the Magic Crystal
Destruction Battle Tournament

419
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:42,541
or whatever is supposed
to happen here? It's huge!

420
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,166
[JULIUS]
This vast and varied environment

421
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,750
will be your battle stage.

422
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,291
You'll be able to use all your
skills to your heart's content.

423
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:49,666
Yes, sir!

424
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,375
The matchups for the initial
round have been chosen

425
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:53,541
by lottery and organized
into the bracketed chart

426
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,250
you see here.

427
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,291
Though winning or losing
does not necessarily

428
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,541
correlate to being chosen
for the Royal Knights,

429
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:02,125
more victories will
increase your favorability.

430
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:03,833
This is an ideal
chance for you all

431
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:06,125
to put your talents on display.

432
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,083
[gasps]

433
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:10,916
[NOELLE] Of course I'd
have to face Solid first.

434
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,125
It'll be such a delight to
eliminate you myself, sister.

435
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:20,541
[FINRAL] If I win this one,
I fight Langris next!

436
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:25,166
[ASTA] And the last one
I'm up against'll be Yuno!

437
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:28,333
I know I can make it
that far, no problem!

438
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:31,916
Better yet, I'm gonna
win this whole thing!

439
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,708
Magic Knights, it's time
to start the exam!

440
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:37,666
Yikes! We're in the first
battle and everything!

441
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:40,375
[JULIUS] Attacking your
opponents directly is allowed!

442
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:42,708
And although this should
go without saying,

443
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,875
there is to be
absolutely no killing!

444
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:47,000
Can I have the
spotlight, please?

445
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:48,958
[JULIUS] We have mages
wielding recovery magic

446
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:50,166
standing by for the injured,

447
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,208
so don't hold anything back!

448
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,333
Oh, hey!

449
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:54,666
They brought Owen,
the Clover Kingdom's

450
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,250
number-one quack. I didn't
know you were gonna be

451
00:19:56,333 --> 00:20:00,541
part of this exam, too, doc!
My arms are doin' a lot better!

452
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:03,041
Sorry, I didn't mean
to worry ya!

453
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:10,833
[VANESSA]
Yoohoo!

454
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:12,791
The Beautiful Babes of
the Black Bulls are here

455
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:14,750
to cheer for our friends,
you got this!

456
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:16,583
Yay!

457
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:18,208
[mumbling] You've got
our full support!

458
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:21,041
Hey! Thank you so much!

459
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:22,583
But shouldn't at least
a couple of you guys

460
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:24,250
be holding down
the fort right now?

461
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:25,625
Captain Yami waved us off,

462
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:28,708
so I assumed it was
fine with him.

463
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:30,500
Aw, he's so supportive.

464
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:32,416
But that's our
Captain Yami for you!

465
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,291
Well, it looks like we're
about to get things started.

466
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:38,208
Ah. I see Asta's fighting
in the first match.

467
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:41,000
That really does suit his
personality, don't ya think?

468
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:42,500
Asta!

469
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:45,000
You better show these weak
losers who they're messing with!

470
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:48,708
Aw, man! Down in front!
Dumb tall people!

471
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:50,833
How'm I s'posed to feast
my eyes on my beloved

472
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,666
Prince of Provisions if
I can't see anything?

473
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,166
[gasps]

474
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,625
Now that the
explanations are done,

475
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:58,958
I hope our first
two teams are ready.

476
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:00,708
[CHARMY]
Aw, yeah!

477
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:07,041
[yells] I was born
ready, Your Majesty!

478
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:45,291
[FULL CAST]
Clover Clips!

479
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:49,916
[MIMOSA]
"What Hot Spring?"

480
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,875
What's up, Yuno?

481
00:22:52,958 --> 00:22:55,083
That hot spring trip sure
was a lot of fun, wasn't it?

482
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:56,083
Uh-huh.

483
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,583
Did you say hot spring?

484
00:22:57,666 --> 00:23:00,083
I don't remember you
mentioning anything like that.

485
00:23:00,166 --> 00:23:01,583
Eh.

486
00:23:01,666 --> 00:23:03,833
Oh, that's not a
very clear response!

487
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:05,250
Or should I assume
that it's a secret

488
00:23:05,333 --> 00:23:06,416
between you two?

489
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,083
If that's the case,
then I have to know!

490
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:10,333
This water's great!

491
00:23:10,416 --> 00:23:11,541
Sure is.

492
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:13,833
[MIMOSA]
Soaking in the bath together...

493
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:15,250
Are you itchy anywhere?

494
00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:17,708
I've got a little itch at
the base of my right ear.

495
00:23:17,791 --> 00:23:19,875
--Did I get it?
--[YUNO] Yeah, thanks.

496
00:23:19,958 --> 00:23:22,291
[MIMOSA]
And washing each other's hair...

497
00:23:23,708 --> 00:23:25,625
Could you tell what I
just wrote on your back?

498
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:26,791
"Pop-potato?"

499
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:28,000
You got it!

500
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:29,833
Okay, now draw somethin' on me!

501
00:23:29,916 --> 00:23:32,708
[MIMOSA] And tracing letters
on each other's naked backs...

502
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:35,708
What happened? I need to know!

503
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:37,166
Is Mimosa okay?

504
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,041
All we did was talk about
goin' to a hot spring

505
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:41,333
and it started makin' her
all weird and lightheaded!

506
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:44,125
She must really love
taking baths or something.

507
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:48,250
[MIMOSA] The competition
for the Royal Knights

508
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:49,500
is about to begin!

509
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:51,958
So I, Mimosa Vermillion,
will do my best to stay

510
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:54,083
out of the way and not
mess anything up!

511
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:57,875
<i>Black Clover</i> , Page 74:
"Flower of Resolution."

512
00:23:57,958 --> 00:24:00,791

ready to bloom!
