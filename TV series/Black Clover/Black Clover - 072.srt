then what the heck
else do I have?

30

I can't do it the usual way.

00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,833
What I need is a
totally different plan.

[ASTA] Right, my new power!
But what makes it work?

34
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:29,666
I kinda blacked out
the first time,

35
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,666
and next thing I knew,
I looked like that!

What am I doing?!

37

Thinking so hard that it
makes your head explode?

Doesn't seem like your style.

Good point!

00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:40,708
[ASTA]
I can't overthink this.

Just gotta focus
and empty my mind.

I promise you, I can do it
if you gimme another chance.

[ASTA whimpers]

50
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:10,291
[MEREOLEONA] Very well. Then
at least put up a good fight.

51
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,666
Got it!

52
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,500
[ASTA]
Well, yeah, that's my thing!

53
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:16,000
Strugglin' through to
the end is all I know!

54
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,250
Hey, wait.

55
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:19,125
I wasn't just not
thinking about anything

56
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:21,125
the first time I
used that power.

57
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:24,541
I was dying. That's
why I blacked out!

58
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:30,875
[ASTA] So, maybe I should
dive into that magma.

59
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:34,125
[ASTA chuckles] Well, I am
the guy who plowed straight

60
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:35,958
into a Salamander bomb.

00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:38,375
This doesn't scare me one bit!

62
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:40,125
No, that's not it!

63
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:42,500
That would just be
reckless and stupid!

64
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:45,000
I can't forget what
Fuegoleon told me!

65
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:47,333
That it's important
to stay calm!

66
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:50,416
I need to think harder.

67
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,166
Gah, it's no use!

68
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,958
Now I can't think of anything!

69
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:55,666
Man, I really am an idiot!

70
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:59,291
That Mana Skin barrier
thing is pretty awesome.

71
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:02,125
Gee, it's too bad I don't
have any magic power!

72
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:03,916
This is weird. I haven't
been upset about that

73
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,458
in a long time!

74
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,708
[ASTA]
Hey, wait a minute, Asta!

75

Quit bein' jealous
of other people!

76
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:14,000
There's plenty of
stuff you can--

77
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,791
I don't see how a fool
who doesn't even

78
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:18,500
know himself can
achieve anything great.

79
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:22,000
[ASTA] Don't know myself?
Maybe that's it!

80
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:23,833
What if I just don't have
a very good understanding

81
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:25,500
of the powers I have?

82
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:26,833
Okay, number one.

83
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:29,375
I've got this anti-magic
sword that only I can use

84
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:31,750
because I don't have
magic power of my own.

85
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:34,083
It slices through any spell,
but in a place like this,

86
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:36,041
it's pretty much useless.

87
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:38,291
Number two: the
strength and stamina

88
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:39,708
to wield that sword.

89
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,166
They're good for regular
mountain climbing,

90
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,541
but this volcano is more than
I can physically tackle.

91
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:46,750
Number three: thanks
to Captain Yami,

92
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,500
I've got the
ability to sense ki,

93
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:50,458
which I'm using right now.

94
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:54,500
It helps me pick up on erupting
lava and falling rocks.

95
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,375
Right!

96
00:05:56,458 --> 00:06:00,333
[YAMI] A person's glance,
their breathing, their scent,

97
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:03,583
the way their muscles move,
the hint of their presence.

98
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:06,083
Taken together, all of
that living energy

99
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:09,083
people give off--
that's called ki.

100
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:10,791
That's my fighting style.

101
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:13,541
I combine the ability
to sense ki with my magic

102
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,416
and the strength of my muscles.

103
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,833
[ASTA]
Maybe if I use ki on myself,

104
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:20,708
I can get a read on
that crazy new power!

105
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,166
[ASTA] I knew it. I can
feel my own ki inside me.

106
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,875
Plus, there's some
kind of black energy

107
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:33,458
comin' from my anti-magic sword!

108
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:36,250
If I can make it stronger
somehow and figure out

109
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:38,666
a way to get it moving
through my entire body...

110
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:42,000
Like... a river? No, a circle!

111
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:44,041
Now I just need to picture it.

112
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:50,541
[ASTA]
There we go! Perfect!

113
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:54,708
This stance is helping the
power circulate all over me!

114
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:57,333
But I'm not done. Not yet.

115
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:59,166
It needs more intensity!

116

anti-magic transferring

117
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:03,500
from the sword into
Asta's body caused him

118
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:06,208
to undergo a sudden
physical change.

119
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:11,583
That's it! My strength
is overflowing!

120
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:14,000
This should take me
straight to the summit!

What? No way!

Why isn't that attack working?

Hold your ground!

127
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,625
If we can't defeat this thing,
then we've got no right

to call ourselves Magic Knights!

a finger to help us.

so I'm kind of in the dark.

315
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,583
She was very strong.

[gasps]

317
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:37,000
[MEREOLEONA] She gave me
lessons all the time.

318
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:38,666
I may be undefeated in battle,

319
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,083
but I was never
victorious against her.

320
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:43,208
Regardless of the fact
that my magic affinity

321
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:45,750
should have given
me an advantage.

322
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:48,750
The steel princess who whirled
around the battlefield.

Acier Silva.

324
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:53,500
Her strength and beauty
captivated one and all.

325
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:56,500
In terms of your looks,
you resemble her a lot.

326
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:58,250
Spitting image, even.

327
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,666
But your magic power
is another story.

328
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,291
Your control is sloppy,
to say the least.

329
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,750
Makes it hard to believe
you're her daughter.

330
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:08,958
Her magic was refined
to an unparalleled degree.

331
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:10,833
It was so dignified.

332
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:15,416
But despite your royal status,
your magic is ugly and coarse.

333

00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:35,166
you should run away
or make excuses!

Hey! No fair!

Using wind to cool
the water down like that

357

is totally cheating!

358

Cheating? I'm just
using my magic.

Y'know, kinda like you're
doing to heat up the water.

There're better ways

There are? Like what, Captain?

Oh, I know: strength training!

364
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:29,458
It's gotta be strength training!

'Cause nothin's better
than strength training!

Shut it, cupcake.

Wait, it's not
strength training?

muscles instead of brains.

[YAMI sighs]
Isn't it obvious?

I'm not sure that's
such a good idea.

Listen to the bunch of you,

of beardless boys.

A man's got to
explore the unknown.

00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:13,208
Even if it costs his life.

386
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:15,291
[LEOPOLD]
Exploring the unknown.

387
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,666
[CRIMSON LIONS] Is that what
it means to be a man?

Jeez, you idiots
have a lot to learn.

You wanna take a look, too,
don'tcha, Mister Cool?

390
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,541
Meh. Not interested.

I'm sick of you, boy,
and your high and mighty act.

Think you're a lady-killer, huh?

No... I don't. Now please stop.

I'm just not that kind
of guy, that's all.

395

And exactly what "kind of guy"

are you implying
I am, Mister Cool?

'Cause I don't think I like it.

Please let him go, Captain Yami!

Wait, is it possible?

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,375
Could this be what
my brother wanted

to teach me back then?
