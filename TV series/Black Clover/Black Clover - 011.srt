Threatened by a ruthless demon,

00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:18,708
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:24,333

lost until a lone mage

stepped forward and
took up the fight.

[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:39,750
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

[ASTA]
How do ya like that?

8
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:48,291
I may be a commoner, but I won!

00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:52,291
Yeah! How do ya like that, huh?!

10
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:55,208
Hey, man, are you all right?

11
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:58,208
He is such a fool,
and a reckless one, at that.

spill everything.

They will not.

They were willing
to go that far?

24
00:01:35,541 --> 00:01:38,125
What was he thinking?

25
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:39,916
How could they?

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,833
Treating life like it's
something to throw away...

Somebody died back there.

Sorry, Captain, but is this
really the time to be laughing?

Why not, kid?

34
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:36,750
Is bein' sad gonna
bring Seihi back? Huh?

No. You're exactly
right, Yami, sir.

36
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:41,291
Seihi wouldn't want our sorrow.

37
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:43,000
He was a man of laughter.

Come on. Let's laugh
for the old guy.

Okay, that's enough.

It's a real shame
what happened to Seihi,

48

but you protected the villagers.

doing with your hand?

00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:31,458
Are you kidding me?

57
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:34,208
You seriously don't know
the Magic Knight salute?

58
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,083
Well, take a good look.

59
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:39,291
These fingers represent the
three leaves of a clover.

60

Go on. You try.

00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:42,166
Does this look right?

00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,541
[MAGNA]
Yeah, not bad!

63
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:50,208
[FINRAL]
We're back!

64
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:51,916
We heard about Saussy Village.

65
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,458
Good work out there.

66
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:56,375
Thanks! It was a tough
mission, but we did our best.

67
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:57,541
[FINRAL]
We visited the

68
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,708
Magic Investigation
Department, Captain.

69
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:00,791
Yeah? Good.

70
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:02,458
Did you learn anything?

71
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:04,333
Like who the hell that guy was?

72
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:06,750
I'll find his hideout
and tear it apart.

73
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:09,416
And the same thing goes
for the one that got away.

74
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,208
Yeah, about that guy.

75
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:13,875
The investigators
checked the area

76
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:16,583
and went over the
things he left behind.

77
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:17,916
But so far, no dice.

78
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,750
Ugh! What good are they, then?

79
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:26,791
[YAMI]
That's enough! Hear me?

80
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:30,958
Quit breaking everything!

81
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:32,375
[MAGNA]
Sorry, sir!

82
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,166
That pocket watch
was pretty nice--

83
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,375
not something just
anybody would own.

84
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:38,708
That's true.

85
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:41,083
Also, based on the remarks
he made about commoners,

86
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:45,125
I'd say we're looking at
someone of fairly high rank.

87
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:48,041
Royalty, or at least nobility.

88

Oh! Who's this? Cutie pie!

the whole building, here?

[NOELLE, ASTA]
Sorry, Captain, sir!

103

[NOELLE]
Although you're the one

104
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:25,041
who's doing most of the damage.

105
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:29,166
[YAMI] Okay, everybody.
Shut up and listen.

106
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,333
Doesn't make a difference
if the guy is royalty,

107
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:34,333
nobility, or whatever.
We'll leave the investigation

108
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:37,125
to the pros and wait for
the report to come in.

109
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:40,916
Now that's settled. I've got
some good news for you.

110
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,916
[ASTA, NOELLE]
Good news? About what?

111
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,916
[YAMI]
You wanna hear?

112
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,708
Yeah, of course we do!

113
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:50,000
[YAMI] Believe it or not,
the Wizard King himself

114
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:51,750
has recognized your efforts.

115
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:53,500
The Wizard King?

116
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:56,500
For your work in Saussy Village,
he awarded us a star.

117
00:06:56,583 --> 00:07:01,500
A star? Seriously? Go us!

118
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:03,500
We got a star!

119

Wow, nice.

Congrats, you three!

121

[ASTA]
So, what does the star mean?

122
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:11,333
You're celebrating when
you don't even know?

123
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:12,666
It's a symbol.

124
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,041
The Wizard King
gives them to people

125
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:15,541
who perform great deeds.

126
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,583
Oh, wow! So, what's it good for?

127
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:20,541

Uh. Well, I mean, it's an honor.

It's an honor. A real
medal for us real men.

And woman, too, don't forget.

A medal for us
real men <i>and</i> woman!

133
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:31,958
You make no sense half the time.

134
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:33,416
It's a competition, too.

135
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,333
The squads all vie to see
who can get the most.

136
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:38,291
It's an indicator of
a squad's achievement.

137
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,333
The more stars you have,
the more successful you are.

138
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:44,208
Whoa! I guess they're
a really big deal then, huh?

139
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:45,541
[VANESSA]
Right now the Golden Dawn's

140

ranked highest in terms
of stars. They've got 70.

Seventy? What about us?

142
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,208
How many do the
Black Bulls have?

143
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,666
We can't be that far behind!

144
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,750
How many do <i>we</i> have?

145
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:10,166
With this one, we're officially
at negative 30 now.

146
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,291

"Negative"?

[NOELLE]
What?!

148
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:15,833
Finally, an even hundred away
from catching up to the Dawn.

149
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:17,666
A hundred away?!

[ASTA]
One hundred stars?!

151

We have some serious
catching up to do

152

if we're gonna beat
your squad, Yuno!

153
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,833
Not happening.

154
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,458
[NOELLE] How do you even
get negative stars?

155
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:31,541
What am I doing in this squad?

156
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,750
All right, just one more thing.

157
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:38,916
Your wages for this month.

158
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,916
[gasps] No way!
There's so much money!

159

There's, like, 200,000 yul here!

160

[MAGNA]
Thank you, Captain!

161
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,041
Yeah, thank you, Captain Yami!

Sure, eat up, Charmy.

164
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:54,958
Captain, let's make a deal.

165
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:57,416
How much do I have to give ya
for you to fight me?

Come on, name your price!

167
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,083
Give it up, kid.

168
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:01,666
Aw! That's no fair.

169
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,041
Now that we've been paid,

170
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,875
I'd like to use the money
to buy some clothes

171
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,916
for my angelic
little sister, Marie.

172
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,791
What do you think
would suit her, Captain?

173
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,333

off tomorrow, everybody.

[BLACK BULLS]
Thanks a lot, Captain Yami!

182
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,416
[GORDON mumbling] Thank you,
Captain. Payday's the best.

183
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,000
It'd be nice to go somewhere
to celebrate together.

184
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:32,041
Right? What do you
say, everybody?

185
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,166
Who's coming with me?

186
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,333
Barely pocket change.

Wha--? Are you kidding me?!

188

This could buy ten years'
worth of pop-potatoes, easy!

189
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,875
And what in the world
are "pop-potatoes?"

190
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:44,083
[ASTA] They're a hearty crop
grown in Hage Village.

191
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,833
A bit on the lumpy side
with a real subtle flavor.

192

They sound disgusting.

Well, they're not, at all!

Everything that Sister Lily
cooks with them comes out great!

Who is that?

196
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:57,375

I'm going to marry someday.

[NOELLE]
What?

198
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,708
"Sister" means she's
a woman of the cloth.

199
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:02,250
You do know they can't marry?

200

[yelps] I'll make
it work somehow.

surpassing my limits!

Oh, I'm, um, sending
it to the church.

Back in Hage, where I'm from.

210

Good! That's what
a real man does, Asta.

211
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Helps his family.

Yeah, I'm pumped about it!

Are you sending yours

You bet I am! Well, kinda.

He never learns.

Go big or go home!

That's what a real man does!

A really stupid man.
That I believe.

221
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:47,125
It's good to help out back home,
but don't send it all, kiddo.

222
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:49,291
You should use a little
of it on yourself.

00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:51,833
Okay, I guess I can do that.

But, how, exactly?

00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:55,833
Oh, that's easy!

226
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:58,208
We'll go shopping in
the castle town tomorrow.

227
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:59,625
It'll be so much fun.

[VILLAGER 11A]
Hey, see the robes?

[VILLAGER 11B] Probably

They're making quite a fuss
over our robes, aren't they?

Yep. Don't worry, though.

They know that having
Magic Knights around

is an excellent crime deterrent.

[VANESSA] Hm. You don't
seem to be impressed.

00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:37,791
Not especially.

383
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:39,875
[VANESSA]
Hah. I'm not surprised.

384
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:44,416
Royals and nobles instinctively
dislike this place.

385
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,958
But you might change your mind.

386
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:49,416
Are you still having some
issues? You know, with control?

387
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,166
Well, yes, but why
does that matter?

388
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,958
Because, sweetie,
there are items here

389

that can suppress magic.

Look hard and you might
find just the right item.

00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:01,916
One to tweak your magic power.

392
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,708
Then maybe you would finally
be able to control it.

that's possible?

Bringing in small-time
purse snatchers.

This is the worst.

But if I say no,
I'll answer to the captain.

with odd jobs.

and they use me as a decoy!
