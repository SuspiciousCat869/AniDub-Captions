00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:36,750
[SISTER THERESA] There, there.
It will be all right, children.

162
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,750
[LUCA]
Asta!

163
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,875
Everything's gonna
be fine, don't worry.

164
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:43,625
[GAUCHE] Hurry up and heal
Marie's injuries, you old cow.

165
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:47,041
I was going to anyway,
you uncivilized oaf.

166
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:50,333
[SISTER THERESA]
Flame Recovery Magic:

167
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:52,625
Sacred Healing Light.

168
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:57,083
[GAUCHE] Hey, you brats
in the middle there.

169
00:09:57,166 --> 00:10:00,250
Marie should have the best spot,
so move over and make room.

170
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,333
It's okay, I don't
care where I sit.

171
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:04,458
[gasps] That's my Marie.

172
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:06,291
With the kindness of an angel.

173
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,458
And an angel deserves the best!

174
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:12,000
The spell will work the same
no matter where she is.

175
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:14,000
[ASTA] I've got some dried
pop-potatoes here, Marie.

176
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,333
They'll perk you right up.

177
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:16,875
[GAUCHE] Keep that garbage
away from my sister!

178
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:19,500
[ASTA] Hey! It's my
hometown's specialty.

179
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,458
[cackling]

180
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,541
[SISTER THERESA] Asta, weren't
you raised at the church

181
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:25,250
in Hage Village?

182
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,208
Yeah, how did you know?

183
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:29,500
[SISTER THERESA]
Well, as it happens,

184
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:32,458
Sister Lily once came
to my church to train.

185
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:35,958
She told me all about a young
orphan who was in her care.

186
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:39,083
Seriously?! You actually
know Sister Lily?

187
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:41,583
One of the sweetest
young ladies I've ever met.

188
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,458
I know, right?

189
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:46,041
[gasps] Wait! What exactly
did she tell you?

190
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:47,708
Was it good?

191
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:50,041
She told me that you
were little and noisy.

192
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:51,916
[yelps]

193
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,041
Of course, that wasn't
the only thing she said.

194
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:59,833
[LILY sighs] Once this is done,
I'll move on to the windows.

195
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:01,666
Easy now, you'll
wear yourself out

196
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,583
if you work this
hard from day one.

197
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:05,875
Sister, this is
nothing, I promise.

198
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:08,958
I know someone who works so hard
he puts my efforts to shame.

199
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:10,833
Oh?

200
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:12,375
There's a boy back
in Hage who can't

201
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:15,125
use magic at all but still
spends every day training

202
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,958
in hopes of becoming
the Wizard King.

203
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:18,333
You must be joking.

204
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:20,541
He can't even get into
a Magic Knight squad

205
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:22,208
if he doesn't have magic.

206
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:23,625
Probably not.

207
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:25,333
But if you told him
to give up, he'd say,

208
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:27,125
"Not yet! I'm not done!"

209
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:29,291
So, maybe he will.

210
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:30,958
Now I'm saying it, too.

211
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:34,208
Get some rest?
Not yet! I'm not done!

212
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,291
[SISTER THERESA]
She also told me that you're

213
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:39,375
a hard worker,
who doesn't give up

214
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:41,625
no matter what
obstacles he faces.

215
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:45,208
A boy with a strong heart who
makes her proud every day.

216
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:46,500
And now I can see that

217
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,583
all of your hard work
has paid off.

218
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,791
[gasps, laughs]

219
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,500
Yeah, and I'm not done!

220
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:55,791
I'm gonna be the
Wizard King someday, too!

221
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:56,958
Now about that.

222
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:58,583
I'm not giving up!

223
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:01,291
[ASTA] Sister Lily, I'm not
giving up on you, either.

224
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:04,041
So please, please, please,
please, please marry me!

225
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,208
[NEIGE screams]

226
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,166
You're the one who hit her.

227
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,416
Marie told me.

228
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,625
That crime can only be
paid for with your life.

229
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:15,875
That's enough, Gauche.

230
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:18,416
I'm fine! All healed
up and everything!

231
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,250
Please don't hurt him anymore.

232
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:21,833
Can't you just forgive him?

233
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:23,541
[GAUCHE]
Not a chance.

234
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:28,625
[GAUCHE] If someone poses
a threat to my beloved Marie,

235
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:30,125
I will show no mercy!

236
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,333
We need to focus on
getting that magic back,

237
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:34,791
not petty vengeance.

238
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:38,541
Tell me. Why did the
two of you do this?

239
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:41,291
These children are the
hope of our kingdom.

240
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:45,083
The three-leaf sprouts upon
which our future depends.

241
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:48,583
I didn't want this.

242
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:51,708
I just wanted to make
some new friends.

243
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:56,125
It hurts. Please, Baro,
tell me what I should do.

244
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,333
[BARO]
Well for a start,

245
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,375
you could quit whining
like a little brat.

246
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:02,083
Damn, damn, damn! It's not fair!

247
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:04,375
Why did this have
to happen to me?

248
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:07,250
[BARO]
It's all her fault.

249
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:08,750
I thought we were
gonna make a fortune,

250
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:11,250
but it was a trick
the whole time.

251
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,958
[BARO]
Come on! Show your stupid face!

252
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:17,833
[SALLY]
Wow!

253
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:20,791
--That sounds like...
--[BARO] Finally!

254
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:24,250
Pretty slow for someone
who can use Spatial Magic!

255
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:25,375
We hit a snag.

256
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:28,125
Think I could get
a little help here?

257
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,333
[SALLY] Ugh, I am so
sick of your whining.

258
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:34,166
But it looks like you brought me
a present, so I'll let it slide.

259
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,083
Asta!

260
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:37,291
The Eye of the Midnight Sun.

261
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:41,083
[SALLY laughing] I didn't expect
to see you again so soon!

262
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:42,916
[ASTA]
It's the crazy lady!

263
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:54,250
[YAMI] What? Somethin's
goin' down in Nean?

264
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,625
And you didn't think you should
mention it sooner, you idiot?

265
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:59,166
[SEKKE]
But I did try to tell you.

266
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,416
No excuses!

267
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,916
[SEKKE sobs]

268
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,750
[YAMI]
So, they need backup, do they?

269
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:05,500
Huh?

270
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:07,500
[mumbling]

271
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:08,833
[YAMI]
No one's ever really sure

272
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:10,916
what these two
weirdos are thinking.

273
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,916
Guess I should go.
Except I don't wanna.

274
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:20,291
[SEKKE] How did these three even
make it into the Magic Knights?

275
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,750
[NUN 31A]
Everyone, please remain calm.

276
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:26,791
Head to the church for now.

277
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,125
[KAI]
Where are they?

278
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:29,458
[PIM]
I miss them.

279
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:32,041
It'll be okay! They'll be
home soon, I'm certain.

280
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:33,916
They may not look it,
but Asta and Gauche

281
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,750
are both really strong,
and we'll be getting backup

282
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,041
from headquarters, too.

283
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:38,666
Yeah?

284
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,541
[PIM]
Really?

285
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:45,041
[REBECCA] You kids wanna
help with dinner?

286
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:47,458
[PIM]
Sure!

287
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:50,583
[NOELLE] We are getting
backup, aren't we?

288
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:52,041
[SALLY]
What's this?

289
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,750
I came when the Transmission
tool alerted me,

290
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:57,625
but you haven't
gathered much magic.

291
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:59,458
[BARO] Yeah, well,
it's all their fault!

292
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:03,500
[SALLY giggles] Eh. It doesn't
really matter anymore.

293
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:06,125
[SISTER THERESA] Stay here,
children. No one move.

294
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:09,750
[gasps] Is it them, Asta?

295
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:12,125
The terrorist group who
attacked the capital?

296
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:13,666
Yeah, it's the same people.

297
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,500
You're the one.

298
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:18,125
My Marie was in danger
because of you?

299
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,000
You're dead.

300
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:24,375
Gel Magic: Go,
Sticky Salamander!

301
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,958
I'm trying to have a
touching reunion here,

302
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:29,666
and you're messing it up.

303
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,583
Maybe I should keep all of you.

304
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:32,958
Dissection party!

305
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:35,458
What sort of sinister
magic is that?

306
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:38,250
Be careful. It's real strong.

307
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:41,541
I heard she blocked the captain
of the Silver Eagles' attack.

308
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:48,500
[SALLY]
Here we go!

309
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:51,125
[ASTA]
Look out!

310
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:53,791
[yells]

311
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,958
[giggles]

312
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:57,208
[ASTA]
No!

313
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:05,000
Silly Asta, your Anti-Magic
attacks can't do much

314
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,291
if they don't connect.

315
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:08,166
[GAUCHE]
What about this?

316

She's warping the beams!

318
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:21,458
Hey, it's nice magic and all,
but if it just refracts

319
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:24,708
inside Mister Salaman here,
it's not exactly effective.

320
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:27,666
Maybe you'd have better luck
if you tried something stronger!

[SALLY] You look like
such an ordinary human.

00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:55,958
But you're not. You're special.

That hurts! And it's freaky!

Oh! Your blood's
ordinary enough.

Now. Next up.

[SISTER THERESA] Flame Magic:

Aw! Mister Salaman melted away.

[SISTER THERESA yells]

339
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:29,666
You might as well back off!

340
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,250
You're not taking him.

341
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:33,500
You really shouldn't
get in my way.

[ASTA]
That was awesome!

Hey, thanks! Wow!

You're really powerful, huh?

Don't underestimate Theresa
the Crimson She-Leopard!

346
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,750
Once a Magic Knight,
always a Magic Knight.

347
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:47,666
Whoa!

348
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,458
[ASTA]
Didn't see that one coming!

349
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:52,666
[ASTA]
You were a Magic Knight?

350
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,541
"Crimson She-Leopard."

351
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,041
So you know Captain Fuegoleon?

352
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:57,666
Little Fuego? Of course.

353
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:58,916
[ASTA]
"Little Fuego"?!

354
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,541
Back when I was
stationed at court,

355
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:03,083
I was in charge
of his education.

356
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,333
Your mana is all over the place.

357
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:07,083
Oh, right.

358
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:09,458
Your foes won't
hesitate in battle.

359
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:12,666
You must learn to focus
and remain calm at all times.

360
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,916
Ma'am!

361

[SISTER THERESA]
He was a real mess back then,

362
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,500
but he turned out all right.

363
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:21,833
[ASTA]
I cannot picture that.

364
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:24,541
I don't know if you heard
about what happened

365
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:26,750
to Captain Fuegoleon, Sister.

366
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:28,250
They, well...

367
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:31,541
[SISTER THERESA] Yes, I know.
And we will capture them.

368
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:34,708
[GAUCHE] Think you can
help me out, you old bat?

369
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:36,000
[SISTER THERESA]
What are you doing over there,

370
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:37,500
you boorish brute?

371
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,166
Shut up, old crone.

372
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:42,291
So, it's three
against one, then.

373
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:44,666
I'm not liking these odds.

374
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,041
[BARO]
Hey, over here.

375
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,458
[SALLY]
Hm?

376
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:49,833
If I was free, I could use
my Mud Magic to help you.

377
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:53,041
Cut me loose,
it'll be a win-win.

378
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:55,041
You can do something, right?

379
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:56,791
Well, yeah, there is
a way to get you out,

380
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:59,041
but are you really
sure you want me to?

381
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:00,291
[BARO]
Of course I'm sure!

382
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:03,041
Whatever it takes. Come on!

383
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:05,375
Okay, why not? You're sure?

384
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:06,041
[BARO]
Yes!

385
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,083
Really sure?

386
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:10,000
[BARO]
I said yes! Just do it!

387
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:13,250
Hey, what're you two
muttering about over there?

388
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:14,500
Hurry up, wouldja?

389
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:16,125
Get me out of these and
pay me like we agreed,

390
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:19,250
and I'll help you take
down all three of them.

391
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:20,791
[BARO]
Yeah, right.

392
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:24,166
As soon as I'm free and I've
got my money, I'm outta here.

393
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:27,083
[SALLY]
All right, then. In that case...

and you've got scads
of magic power now.
