00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,666
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,458
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:24,708
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:27,208
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:35,708
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:39,708
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:43,625
[NARRATOR] Asta joined
forces with his friends

8
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:45,791
to take on Vetto,
the strongest opponent

9
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:47,166
they had ever faced.

10
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,833
However, the beast soon
began to overpower

11
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:52,833
even these attacks.

12
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:56,125
[VETTO] I'm impressed.
You aren't half bad.

13
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:59,083
If even one of you
slips up, you'll be dead,

14
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:01,041
and you'll take the
other two with you.

15
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:03,166
[NARRATOR] With his back to
the wall, Asta brandished

16
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:07,083
his sword, putting his trust in
his friends and their victory.

17
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:07,958
Then, suddenly...

18
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:10,833
[GAUCHE]
It's not just two!

19
00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:12,791

But how?

27
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,458
I used my Transformation Magic
to make some doubles.

28
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:30,875
I've had enough!

29
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:34,375
Time to plunge you
insects into despair!

30
00:01:34,458 --> 00:01:38,833
Yeah, right! Who has time
to waste on despair?

He did it!

[GAUCHE, CHARMY]
Yeah!

36
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,500
It's over.

00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:33,041

We won!

Did you truly believe that
your pitiful human power

42
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:45,083
would have any effect on me?

43
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:47,000
That was a fatal mistake!

44
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:49,583
I took that blow
on purpose, you fool,

45
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,208
in a place that
wouldn't kill me.

46
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:53,125
All so I could
steal your weapon.

[BOTH gasp]

48
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,666

[VETTO]
I know full well

50
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:03,000
when all hope is lost,
that is when despair sets in,

profound and unshakable.

So, how do you feel now?

Ha, ha! You'll never recover!

Not yet.

I'm not done!

[ASTA]
It's not over.

Who's despairing now?

That's it-- the last
of our magic power!

No!

We're not giving up.

Hey, Asta, are you okay?

88
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:20,333
[VANESSA]
This boy--he's not like us.

89
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:21,875
Born with no magic at all

90
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:25,541
into a world where
magic is everything.

91
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:26,750
And yet...

92
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:29,416
Maybe the fates chose
him to go without

93
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,208
because of who he is and
what he's capable of.

94
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:34,500
[VANESSA]
Whatever the case,

95
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:36,750
he's destined to
do great things.

96
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:40,833
We have to help him fight and
guide him when he needs it.

97
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:42,041
Here you go, kiddo!

00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:44,333
I've made you a sling
for that broken arm!

Thanks, Vanessa. That's
exactly what I needed.

100
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:49,958
I may have a busted arm,

101
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:52,291
but, I can still fight!

102
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:54,000
[VANESSA]
Finral, get ready to go again!

103
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,250
Huh? Yeah!

I've still got one sword left!

Why, human?

108
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:16,375
Why do you not despair?

109
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:21,125
[ASTA] I already told you.
I don't have time for despair.

110
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:24,458
There's someone I can't
lose to, no matter what.

111
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:26,333
We made a promise!

One that I won't break!

You and your despair
are getting in the way!

too fast for me to follow!

sword still inside me must

120

be weakening the magic that
enhanced my physical abilities.

121
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:56,416
I had intended
to take his weapon,

122
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,500
but has he stolen mine
from me instead?

You've been losing this
whole time, Vetto!

Not one of us who went
against you has given up.

from killing you!

In the first three dwell
integrity, hope, and love.

00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:35,041
[ASTA] Hey, um, you guys.
Please, stop!

165
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:37,375
I'm super hurt everywhere!

166
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:38,916
[VANESSA, FINRAL]
Oh. Sorry.

167
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,041
[laughs] They really did it!
They defeated that monster!

168
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:47,375
[YAMI] What the hell
kinda power was that?

169
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:49,666
[OCEAN DWELLER 49A]
Did you see what that kid did?

170
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:52,583
[OCEAN DWELLER 49B]
I thought we were done for!

171
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:54,416
[OCEAN DWELLER 49AA]
You saved us, Magic Knights!

172
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,500
[OCEAN DWELLER 49C]
Thank you!

173
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:00,000
So, how do everyone's
injuries look, Vanessa?

174
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:03,666
They're serious, but fortunately
not life-threatening.

175
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,250
Can you transport them with
a Spatial spell, Finral?

176
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:07,791
Sorry, not yet.

177
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:10,916
It's still going to be a while
before my magic's recovered.

178
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,125
[GAUCHE] Thanks a lot,
gutless good-for-nothing.

179
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,916
[yelps] You can't talk
to me like that.

180
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,583
I'm your superior!

181
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:19,833
Poor Kiato. Kahono, too.

182
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:21,750
I really hope they'll be okay.

183
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:22,708
[FINRAL]
Don't you think you should

184
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:25,000
be worrying about yourself?

185
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:26,125
Look how beat up you are.

186
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,500
You trusted us and
got torn to shreds.

187
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:31,000
Seriously, Asta,
what were you thinking?

188
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,541
Yeah, especially when
you're counting

189
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:35,500
on somebody as unreliable
as Finral here to back you up.

190
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:36,750
--[NOELLE] Yeah. Right.
--[GAUCHE, CHARMY] Right. Right.

191
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:39,208
Oh, wow. That's harsh.

192
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:42,375
I mean, sure, of course
I wanted to run away.

193
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,541
But once I saw you
out there, Asta,

194
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:46,833
my body moved on its own.

195
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:49,666
It was all you. You
refused to quit fighting.

196
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:54,000
You trusted us to keep you safe,
and because of that, we won.

197
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:56,666
Please, I don't know what
you guys are talking about.

198
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,791
You're senior squadmates,
handpicked by Yami himself.

199
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,041
'Course I trust you.

200
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:03,375
It really means a lot
to us that you do.

201
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:06,208
Yeah. I'm actually
tearing up here.

202
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:09,125
Your senior squadmates
are pretty awesome.

203
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:11,000
Personally, I think
we're lucky that Yami

204
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:12,958
picked you to be our new rookie.

205
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:14,625
Well... It's Yami.

206
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:18,333
Who else would pick him?
A kid with no magic.

207
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:21,708
Hey, Dorksta isn't the only
rookie he chose, you know.

208
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,250
Of course, Noelle!

209
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:25,333
I hear you were
pretty amazing, too!

210
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:28,166
Something about an incredibly
powerful attack spell.

211
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,875
Oh, yeah, it was awesome!

212
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:32,833
I've never seen anything
like your Sea Dragon's Roar!

213
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:35,375
Good. Now keep the
compliments coming.

214
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:36,875
[FINRAL]
Ooh, and you're cute, too!

215
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:38,458
[CHARMY]
A perfect royal!

216
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:41,208
Well, that has nothing to do
with my role in the battle,

217
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:44,083
but it's accurate, so I
suppose it's acceptable.

218
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:46,125
[NOELLE]
One more, maybe?

219
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:48,083
Hey.

220
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,750
[screams]

221
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:52,083
Stop it!

222
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:54,333
What sort of twisted
thoughts were you thinking?

223
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:56,958
[ASTA]
I wasn't thinking anything!

224
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:58,541
Oh. Sorry.

225
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,791
All right, everybody,
I say it's time to raise

226
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:03,208
a glass and celebrate
our glorious victory!

227
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:05,750
Now is not the time
to start drinking!

228
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,416
We've gotta find a way
to tie this guy up

229
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,458
and haul him outta here.

230
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,166
He's got a freaky
eye on his forehead,

231
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,583
he said some stuff
about my sword,

232
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:15,500
and he's a big shot in the
Eye of the Midnight Sun!

233
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:18,083
There's a lot we
need to ask him!

234
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:21,666
[VETTO whimpering]

235
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,458
[LICHT]
Vetto. Vetto.

236
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:31,916
[LICHT]
Don't cry. It'll be all right.

237
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,125
[VETTO]
Did you see what they did?

238
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:38,250
Those humans tortured this
little bird. It's unforgivable!

239
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:40,333
[LICHT]
I chased those children away.

240
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:42,416
Let's head back and
patch this fellow up.

241
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,916
[VETTO]
Okay. I'm sorry, Licht.

242
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,458
You're always rescuing me.

243
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:48,041
Well, we're friends, right?

244
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:52,333
So I'm happy to.
Whenever you need me.

245
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:53,708
We're like this bird.

246
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:56,291
It's not strong, but it can
do something special--

247
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:57,708
it can fly.

248
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,250
As for us...

249
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,916
We have special magic powers
that the humans envy,

250
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,666
so they want to cause us pain.

251
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,666
Still, I think we may
be able to understand

252
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,000
each other better someday.

253
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:12,875
Okay. Then I think
so, too, Licht.

254
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:18,666
[VETTO] Hope. Such a fragile
thing, and so sweet.

255
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:22,583
That's what Licht was:
the personification of hope.

256
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:26,708
[VETTO]
And who stole that hope?

257
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:30,333
You filthy humans!

258
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:36,291
His power's back?

259
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:39,041
No way. We won!

260
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,666
[VETTO]
I'm taking you with me.

261
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,583
All of you. In fact,

262
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:46,041
I'm going to blow this
entire temple away!

263
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:48,500
No! What's going on?

264
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:49,958
[YAMI]
Damnit!

265
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:50,958
There's no way they're gonna

266
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:54,375
be able to stop
that monster now.

267
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:57,541
That does it! I'm
bustin' outta here!

268
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,625
Why bother trying?

269
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:04,791
[laughs]

270
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:10,500
[yelps]

271
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,500
[FINRAL]
We've seen this before.

272
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:16,541
Not even the Magic Knight
captains could stop it then.

273
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:20,333
It's like their leader's power,
except even more savage!

274
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:22,333
Is he going to self-destruct?

275
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:23,750
My threads are
already burning up,

276
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:25,833
and the power is
only increasing.

277
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:28,500
Damn. We can't get closer.

278
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:31,750
Listen, guys. This doesn't
change anything, okay?

279
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,291
Come on, send me at him.

280
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,416
No, no, no, no, no!

281
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,250
Never mind. Ignore me.

282
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:40,833
I almost chickened out again.
We've come this far.

283
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,541
We've got to see it through.

284
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:44,708
I'll tell you what, Finral:
help us pull this off,

285
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:46,541
and I'll go on a date with you.

286
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:49,375
A date, really?!
Now you're talkin'!

287
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:51,500
There must be something
left we can try!

288
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:52,833
I'm in.

289
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:54,750
No one keeps me from Marie
and gets away with it.

290
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:56,791
We're gonna destroy him,
and then I'm gonna

291
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:58,708
eat all the seafood
in this place!

292
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:01,916
I'm basically terrified.
But I'll do my best!

293
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:10,708
All right! Now come and get us!

294
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:12,458
[YAMI]
I miss anything?

295
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,500
Hey there, you dumbbells.
How's it goin?

296
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,208
[BLACK BULLS]
Captain Yami!

297
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:25,958
You-You really came for us!

298
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:28,791
How, though? Weren't you trapped
somewhere this entire time?

299
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:31,250
Some mage had me trapped
with Spatial Magic,

300
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:32,625
but I managed to
bust through it.

301
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:38,000
[YAMI]
Had to get a little forceful.

302
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,000
What do you mean by forceful?

303
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:42,041
It woulda been better if
you could've gotten here

304
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,333
a little bit earlier, though.

305
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:45,500
Shut up!

306
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:47,708
I've got my reasons,
thank you very much.

307
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,458
I can leave if I'm not wanted.

308
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:51,750
[BLACK BULLS]
Wha...?!

309
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:54,083
[ASTA]
Is Yami pouting?

310
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:58,875
Kiato! Kahono!

311
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:04,458
You poor things! It's all
my fault. That idiotic game!

312
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:05,666
And Gio.

313
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,000
You got dragged into
this mess just to humor

314
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:10,041
a foolish old man.

315
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:13,333
[GIFSO] I knew he was strong,
but using that kind of magic?

316
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:15,333
It's beyond what I'd expected.

317
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:17,375
He's some kind of
monster himself.

318
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:19,250
It's a good thing that
I decided to follow

319
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:22,625
my intuition and not let him
participate in the game.

320
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:25,500
Well, we don't exactly
have a lotta time, here.

321
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:27,125
Let's get this over with.

322
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:28,458
All right!

323
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,625
With Captain Yami here,
we're 100 times stronger!

324
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:33,125
No! A million times stronger!

325
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:36,166
Let's beat the snot
out of that guy!

326
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:39,208
Hey, where's this cockiness
coming from all of a sudden?

327
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:40,875
You gettin' a big head
now 'cause you thought

328
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:42,583
you could beat that guy?

329
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,083
What cockiness?

330
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,958
[YAMI] I can handle
this one on my own, kid.

331
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:50,500
[ASTA]
Huh?

332
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:53,166
[YAMI] You guys have already
risked your lives fighting him.

333
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,916
It's about time for your
captain to take a turn.

334
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,583
Finral.

335
00:18:58,666 --> 00:18:59,916
Vanessa.

336
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,291
Noelle.

337
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:02,208
Gauche.

338
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:04,416
--[YAMI] Charmy.
--[CHARMY] Yay!

339
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,291
Who're you?

340
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,875
Yeah, hi, I'm Grey.

341
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:11,833
You guys, too, Magna, Luck.

342
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:14,875
Real good work, all of you.

343
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,166
[FINRAL]
Yami actually praised me!

344
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,000
[YAMI] Since you've
done so much already,

345
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:22,958
I'll handle the clean-up.

346
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:27,416
Ha. Who am I kidding?
This is the best part.

347
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,333
[YAMI] I meant it, though.
You all did a fine job.

348
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:35,416
You may be a bunch
of knuckleheads,

349
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,875
but you're the reason I
could push past my limits.

350
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:41,541
[BLACK BULLS gasp]

351
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:45,208
[YAMI] Made being stuck in
a little room with my back

352
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:48,916
against the wall worth it.

353
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,041
This spell reminds me
of something that freaky

354
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:55,000
beanpole guy would do, so I
can't say I'm a fan, but...

355
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,583
Don't waste your time!

356
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:59,291
You humans will taste despair!

357
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:02,041
Yes! Despair!

358
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,833
[YAMI] Would you shut up
about your damn

359
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:06,583
despair already, you freak?

360
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:11,958
However strong your magic might
be now, it doesn't matter!

361
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:16,625
'Cause this spell slashes
through dimensions!

362
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:26,875
Dark Magic: Dark Cloaked.

363
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,208
Dimension Slash!

364
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:37,291
[VETTO gasps]

365
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:41,958
[YAMI] Thanks for
toughening up my squad.

366
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:45,541
Now goodbye, Mister Despair.

367

[NARRATOR]
Yami Sukehiro.

369
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:34,791
The captain of the Black Bulls
Magic Knight squad

370
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:38,250
does most of his thinking
here, in the bathroom.

371
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:41,416
Our investigative team had
one question for him.

372
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:51,500
Well, because that's
where the toilet is.

373
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:53,333
But there's one important
thing to remember:

374
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:56,125
before you go, make sure
there's toilet paper.

375
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:59,083
People who go into a bathroom
with no toilet paper...

376
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:01,708
Well, they're like birds
with their wings clipped.

377
00:23:01,791 --> 00:23:03,333
They will never
again venture out

378
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:06,125
into the wild blue yonder.

379
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:07,916
The boy's supposed to
be in charge of keeping

380
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,708
my paper well stocked,
but, he forgets a lot.

381
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:13,791
I've seen my share
of hell because of him,

382
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:17,166
but I've made sure to give him
even worse hell than that.

383
00:23:18,291 --> 00:23:19,750
[NARRATOR] He went on
to speak at some length

384
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:22,291
about the importance of toilets.

385
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:24,625
Before we ended
our interview, however,

386
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:27,958
there was just one more thing
we had to ask the captain.

387
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:33,916
Captain! Please hurry!

388
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,166
How much longer are you
gonna be in there?

389
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,958
[YAMI] Shut up! You didn't
put in a new roll,

390
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,291
so now I can't leave!

391
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:43,166
That's it! I'm busting out!

392
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:48,458
[YAMI]
Please.

393
00:23:48,541 --> 00:23:51,875
I can't sit back and do nothing
after you all fought so hard.

394
00:23:51,958 --> 00:23:53,916
<i>Black Clover</i> , Page 50:

395
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,625
"End of the Battle,
End of Despair."

396
00:23:56,708 --> 00:23:58,833
Now goodbye, Mister Despair.

397
00:23:58,916 --> 00:24:00,791
It's so important,
I said it twice!
