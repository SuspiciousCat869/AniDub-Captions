1
00:00:22,554 --> 00:00:27,142
[NARRATOR] Within the clover's
fifth leaf, there lives a devil.

2
00:00:27,225 --> 00:00:29,686
Asta, born unable
to harness mana,

3
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:31,521
was granted the
power of Anti-magic

4
00:00:31,604 --> 00:00:33,273
from his five-leaf grimoire,

5
00:00:33,356 --> 00:00:36,693
giving him the ability
to nullify spells.

6
00:00:36,776 --> 00:00:39,320
Unfortunately, the members
of Spade Kingdom's

7
00:00:39,404 --> 00:00:41,448
Dark Triad also possess powers

8
00:00:41,531 --> 00:00:43,950
from the devils of the
underworld and used them

9
00:00:44,034 --> 00:00:47,120
to launch an invasion on
their neighboring countries.

10
00:00:47,203 --> 00:00:49,164
Gaining strength from
his belief in himself

11
00:00:49,247 --> 00:00:51,249
and from the support
of his friends,

12
00:00:51,332 --> 00:00:54,669
Asta continues to fight for
the safety of this world.

13
00:01:00,633 --> 00:01:03,011
[NARRATOR] At last,
the battle against Megicula

14
00:01:03,094 --> 00:01:05,638
and the Spade
Kingdom has begun.

15
00:01:05,722 --> 00:01:08,099
After six months of training
in the Heart Kingdom,

16
00:01:08,183 --> 00:01:10,435
Asta and his friends were ready.

17
00:01:10,518 --> 00:01:12,312
They rescued a group
of Spade citizens

18
00:01:12,395 --> 00:01:15,982
and took control of
an outlying enemy base.

19
00:01:16,066 --> 00:01:17,942
Meanwhile, back in Hage Village,

20
00:01:18,026 --> 00:01:21,237
where Asta and Yuno grew up,
fate arrived in the form

21
00:01:21,321 --> 00:01:23,198
of a weakened
and weary traveler.

22
00:01:23,281 --> 00:01:25,700
[gasps] Sir! What happened?

23
00:01:27,077 --> 00:01:29,162
Please. Lord Yuno.

24
00:03:10,138 --> 00:03:11,139
[door creaks]

25
00:03:11,222 --> 00:03:13,183
[HIGH PRIEST]
Where are the children?

26
00:03:13,266 --> 00:03:15,018
[LILY]
I sent them off to school.

27
00:03:15,101 --> 00:03:17,020
Seeing this might be
a bit frightening for them,

28
00:03:17,103 --> 00:03:18,646
especially the younger ones.

29
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:21,399
Good idea. So how is he doing?

30
00:03:21,483 --> 00:03:23,526
Sleeping, though not restfully.

31
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:27,614
I used a recovery spell, of
course, but his wounds are deep.

32
00:03:27,697 --> 00:03:31,785
[HIGH PRIEST sighs] He may have
run into bandits in the forest.

33
00:03:31,868 --> 00:03:33,036
This could be a situation

34
00:03:33,119 --> 00:03:35,372
that calls for the Magic
Knights' intervention.

35
00:03:35,455 --> 00:03:36,831
[LILY]
Yes.

36
00:03:36,915 --> 00:03:39,793
Who is he, this stranger?

37
00:03:42,045 --> 00:03:45,924
[LOROPECHIKA] Good work.
I'm very proud of you all.

38
00:03:46,007 --> 00:03:47,217
Thanks to your efforts,

39
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,302
the Spade Kingdom's base
in the town of Tolon

40
00:03:49,386 --> 00:03:52,013
is no longer under
the enemy's control.

41
00:03:52,097 --> 00:03:53,556
The citizens of
the Spade Kingdom

42
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,558
who were held captive
and drained of their mana

43
00:03:55,642 --> 00:03:57,936
to power the mobile
fortress are recovering.

44
00:03:58,019 --> 00:03:59,771
You saved their lives.

45
00:03:59,854 --> 00:04:02,691
I'm still curious why you
wanted us to return, though.

46
00:04:02,774 --> 00:04:05,652
Couldn't we have proceeded
further into Spade from there?

47
00:04:05,735 --> 00:04:08,113
Fighting those stage two
guys was so boring.

48
00:04:08,196 --> 00:04:10,699
I wanna go up against
someone who's super strong.

49
00:04:10,782 --> 00:04:12,951
Remember what we're
dealing with here.

50
00:04:13,034 --> 00:04:15,203
We can't go barging in
without thinking.

51
00:04:15,286 --> 00:04:17,831
We need to take time
to rest and plan.

52
00:04:17,914 --> 00:04:19,249
You're sure the town
will be all right

53
00:04:19,332 --> 00:04:21,418
without us there to defend it?

54
00:04:21,501 --> 00:04:24,421
[LOROPECHIKA] Don't worry.
We've taken precautions.

55
00:04:24,504 --> 00:04:27,590
[UNDINE] I asked Noelle to bring
one of my clones to Tolon

56
00:04:27,674 --> 00:04:30,301
so the town wouldn't
be left vulnerable.

57
00:04:30,385 --> 00:04:32,554
Through that clone,
I was able to establish

58
00:04:32,637 --> 00:04:34,389
a barrier there
similar to the one

59
00:04:34,472 --> 00:04:36,808
that encloses the Heart Kingdom.

60
00:04:36,891 --> 00:04:38,601
[LOROPECHIKA] Having this
curse inside of me gives

61
00:04:38,685 --> 00:04:43,106
the unique advantage of being
able to sense the devil's magic.

62
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:46,026
We've got a variety of
weapons at our disposal.

63
00:04:46,109 --> 00:04:48,987
Let's use them to gain territory
and corner this devil.

64
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,947
--[ASTA] Yes, ma'am!
--[MAGIC KNIGHTS] Yeah!

65
00:04:51,031 --> 00:04:53,825
[NOELLE] Confidence is good,
but let's not start acting like

66
00:04:53,908 --> 00:04:56,453
this is going to be easy.

67
00:04:56,536 --> 00:04:57,662
All right, that's all I have...

68
00:04:57,746 --> 00:04:59,664
[NOELLE] Still, with
Loropechika's powers,

69
00:04:59,748 --> 00:05:02,959
we might just be able to do it.

70
00:05:03,043 --> 00:05:05,170
Even if she is a bit odd.

71
00:05:05,253 --> 00:05:08,006
[LUCK laughs]
That fight wasn't enough for me.

72
00:05:08,089 --> 00:05:10,175
Hey, Gaja, ya wanna
go a round or two?

73
00:05:10,258 --> 00:05:12,844
Floga's an extremely
powerful Spirit Guardian,

74
00:05:12,927 --> 00:05:14,929
and it was an honor
to have him as my trainer,

75
00:05:15,013 --> 00:05:17,182
but I'd like to
see you in action.

76
00:05:17,265 --> 00:05:19,100
So please, let me join.

77
00:05:19,184 --> 00:05:22,228
Heck yeah! I can
come, too, right?

78
00:05:22,312 --> 00:05:24,606
The three of you are fresh
from the field of battle.

79
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:26,608
You should be resting,
not fighting.

80
00:05:26,691 --> 00:05:27,817
I'm totally fine.

81
00:05:27,901 --> 00:05:29,986
Fresh as a daisy and
ready to roll, I swear!

82
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,655
[laughs] Yeah, and I never
say no to the chance

83
00:05:32,739 --> 00:05:33,990
for a good bloodbath!

84
00:05:34,074 --> 00:05:36,409
Please don't turn us down.
I'm already fired up!

85
00:05:36,493 --> 00:05:38,620
A sparring session
sounds like so much fun!

86
00:05:38,703 --> 00:05:39,913
Can I come out and play?

87
00:05:39,996 --> 00:05:41,998
What in the world are you
thinking, Loropechika?

88
00:05:42,082 --> 00:05:43,667
You know you can't do that!

89
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,919
Of course I can! I'm fine!

90
00:05:46,002 --> 00:05:49,339
[LOROPECHIKA yelps]

91
00:05:49,422 --> 00:05:51,299
[UNDINE]
Loropechika!

92
00:05:51,383 --> 00:05:53,426
I'm so glad that
nobody got injured.

93
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,762
Especially since
they're all so dumb.

94
00:05:55,845 --> 00:05:58,223
They can spar, but I'm still
dirty from the battle.

95
00:05:58,306 --> 00:06:01,017
What I want is a bath.

96
00:06:01,101 --> 00:06:03,645
That sounds wonderful.
I'll come.

97
00:06:03,728 --> 00:06:05,605
And you're going with
them, young lady.

98
00:06:05,689 --> 00:06:07,649
As a queen, you ought
to be indulging yourself

99
00:06:07,732 --> 00:06:09,401
in a proper bath,
not a bloodbath.

100
00:06:09,484 --> 00:06:11,277
All right. In that case,

101
00:06:11,361 --> 00:06:13,279
I know the perfect place
where we can go to relax

102
00:06:13,363 --> 00:06:15,281
and get cleaned up.

103
00:06:15,365 --> 00:06:17,450
[FINRAL] The lovely ladies
of the Clover Kingdom

104
00:06:17,534 --> 00:06:20,578
bathing with the beautiful
queen of the Heart Kingdom.

105
00:06:20,662 --> 00:06:22,080
Bad Finral!

106
00:06:22,163 --> 00:06:25,917
No getting hot and bothered over
any woman but Lady Finnes!

107
00:06:26,001 --> 00:06:27,210
Stop right there.

108
00:06:27,293 --> 00:06:29,671
Think one more dirty
thought and you die.

109
00:06:29,754 --> 00:06:31,214
[FINRAL]
Please, Noelle, I swear!

110
00:06:31,297 --> 00:06:33,258
I'm doing everything
I can to resist!

111
00:06:33,341 --> 00:06:34,801
[GUARD 159A]
Help! We've got trouble!

112
00:06:34,884 --> 00:06:37,679
There's danger in
the Polnfrume Forest!

113
00:06:37,762 --> 00:06:40,056
A wild Charmy has been sighted!

114
00:06:41,141 --> 00:06:42,934
If we don't do something,
she's going to eat

115
00:06:43,018 --> 00:06:45,562
every last fruit on the trees!

116
00:06:45,645 --> 00:06:46,688
Not again.

117
00:06:46,771 --> 00:06:47,981
Again?

118
00:06:48,064 --> 00:06:50,984
Yeah, uh. Charmy seriously
loves the food here.

119
00:06:51,067 --> 00:06:54,696
Big surprise, right?
But this is nuts, even for her.

120
00:06:54,779 --> 00:06:57,991
Her appetite's been wreaking
havoc all over the place.

121
00:06:58,074 --> 00:07:00,410
In one forest, she took
over a group of monkeys

122
00:07:00,493 --> 00:07:03,455
and had them bring
her bananas as tribute.

123
00:07:03,538 --> 00:07:06,166
And in another, she and
a bear threw down

124
00:07:06,249 --> 00:07:08,251
over some special apples.

125
00:07:08,335 --> 00:07:09,627
[LOROPECHIKA]
Well, to be fair,

126
00:07:09,711 --> 00:07:11,671
the fruits of the Heart Kingdom
are quite delicious.

127
00:07:11,755 --> 00:07:14,215
[MIMOSA laughs]
It must be the pure water.

128
00:07:14,299 --> 00:07:15,842
I guess we should go fetch her

129
00:07:15,925 --> 00:07:17,969
before things get
any more out of hand.

130
00:07:18,053 --> 00:07:19,554
I can stop her!

131
00:07:19,637 --> 00:07:21,639
You must be really beat after
movin' all those people around

132
00:07:21,723 --> 00:07:23,099
from place to place.

133
00:07:23,183 --> 00:07:25,226
Get some rest,
let me handle it.

134
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:28,688
Asta, I'm pretty sure you
did more moving than me.

135
00:07:28,772 --> 00:07:31,900
[ASTA] But I didn't use magic
to do it, so I'm fine!

136
00:07:31,983 --> 00:07:34,069
[FINRAL] You can get tired
without using magic,

137
00:07:34,152 --> 00:07:36,988
but whatever.
Go for it. Good luck.

138
00:07:37,072 --> 00:07:38,615
Please go save our fruit!

139
00:07:38,698 --> 00:07:41,201
Right! Demon-Slayer!

140
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:49,501
[ASTA] With my new control
over Anti-magic...

141
00:07:50,877 --> 00:07:52,462
[ASTA]
...I can fly!

142
00:08:00,845 --> 00:08:03,056
I remember when he was
just a magicless kid

143
00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:04,641
who couldn't fly a broom.

144
00:08:04,724 --> 00:08:08,186
Now look at the incredible
Magic Knight he's become.

145
00:08:10,021 --> 00:08:11,272
Wow.

146
00:08:16,444 --> 00:08:18,530
[MIMOSA]
How lovely.

147
00:08:18,613 --> 00:08:21,574
Knowledge of this has been
passed down through generations.

148
00:08:21,658 --> 00:08:23,785
It's the royal family's
private spring.

149
00:08:23,868 --> 00:08:25,328
Amazing!

150
00:08:25,412 --> 00:08:28,623
I'm honored that you would bring
us to such a special place.

151
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,877
The mana I'm sensing
here is very pure.

152
00:08:32,961 --> 00:08:35,005
[UNDINE] The spring
is fed by Elmora Lake,

153
00:08:35,088 --> 00:08:36,589
which has some of
the finest water

154
00:08:36,673 --> 00:08:38,174
in all of the Heart Kingdom.

155
00:08:38,258 --> 00:08:40,301
Bathing here will
rejuvenate your skin,

156
00:08:40,385 --> 00:08:43,179
leaving it delightfully supple
and smooth to the touch.

00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,305
Let's get in.

158
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:45,557
Agreed.

159
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:51,771
[NOELLE sighs]
I feel so much better.

160

nice and refreshing!

163

Ah! I forgot to take
my glasses off, whoops.

164
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,657
[UNDINE sighs]
You're hopeless.

165
00:09:02,741 --> 00:09:04,492
Now then, there's
something I've been

166
00:09:04,576 --> 00:09:07,787
meaning to ask
about for a while.

167
00:09:07,871 --> 00:09:10,165
Which one of you girls
is dating Asta?

168
00:09:10,248 --> 00:09:11,583
[MIMOSA, NOELLE yelp]

169
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:15,003
Ooh, relationship talk?
I'm dying to hear the answer!

170
00:09:15,086 --> 00:09:17,005
[NOELLE coughs]
No!

171
00:09:17,088 --> 00:09:19,299
I mean, none of us
are dating him.

172
00:09:19,382 --> 00:09:21,343
Right. Asta is very kind.

173
00:09:21,426 --> 00:09:24,304
Not to mention reliable
and an absolute gentleman,

174
00:09:24,387 --> 00:09:27,849
but now simply isn't the time
for that sort of thing.

175
00:09:27,932 --> 00:09:28,933
[LOROPECHIKA]
What about when the battle with

176
00:09:29,017 --> 00:09:30,810
the Spade Kingdom
is over, then?

177
00:09:30,894 --> 00:09:32,103
Well, uh...

178
00:09:32,187 --> 00:09:34,939
Oh, my. Something tells me
you might like that.

179
00:09:35,023 --> 00:09:38,276
Although, Nero seems to
spend more time with him

180
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,819
than anyone else.

181
00:09:39,903 --> 00:09:42,864
[LOROPECHIKA] Yes, why is that?
Are you secretly dating him?

182
00:09:45,784 --> 00:09:49,120
[NERO] It's because his head
makes a nice perch.

183
00:09:49,204 --> 00:09:50,372
[UNDINE]
No other reason?

184
00:09:50,455 --> 00:09:51,956
No, that's it.

185
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,709
So you're interested in the top
of his head and nothing else?

186
00:09:54,793 --> 00:09:55,960
[NERO]
Mm-hm.

187
00:09:56,044 --> 00:09:58,838
Well, that's good
to know, I suppose.

188
00:09:58,922 --> 00:10:01,675
[NOELLE] Nero says that now,
but they're bound to grow closer

189
00:10:01,758 --> 00:10:02,967
the more time they
spend together,

190
00:10:03,051 --> 00:10:04,928
and then how will she feel?

191
00:10:05,011 --> 00:10:06,388
[UNDINE]
And what about you, Noelle?

192
00:10:06,471 --> 00:10:08,473
Uh-- Ha! Ridiculous!

193
00:10:08,556 --> 00:10:10,642
I'd never date
an idiot like him!

194
00:10:10,725 --> 00:10:13,103
[LOROPECHIKA] Oh, I see.
That clears things up.

195
00:10:13,186 --> 00:10:14,688
[UNDINE]
Indeed, it does.

196
00:10:14,771 --> 00:10:17,565
[NOELLE] So, let's talk about
your love life, Loropechika.

197
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:19,818
I've assumed for a while
now that you and Gaja

198
00:10:19,901 --> 00:10:22,195
were seeing each other,
but I wasn't sure.

199
00:10:22,278 --> 00:10:24,447
Wait. You thought
I was dating him?

200
00:10:24,531 --> 00:10:27,367
I can assure you, that's most
definitely not the case.

201
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:29,953
[NOELLE] Really?
But you're always together.

202
00:10:30,036 --> 00:10:31,705
[MIMOSA]
You'd make a lovely couple.

203
00:10:31,788 --> 00:10:33,540
[LOROPECHIKA]
That is never going to happen.

204
00:10:33,623 --> 00:10:35,625
I'm sure Gaja
feels the same way.

205
00:10:35,709 --> 00:10:37,585
[UNDINE]
Gaja, you poor man.

206
00:10:37,669 --> 00:10:40,588
You'll never hear about this
conversation from me, though.

207
00:10:42,757 --> 00:10:47,012
[BOTH panting]

208
00:10:47,095 --> 00:10:49,305
[LUCK laughs]
This is awesome!

209
00:10:49,389 --> 00:10:51,850
No wonder you're the leader
of the Spirit Guardians.

210
00:10:51,933 --> 00:10:53,810
Your strength is incredible.

211
00:10:53,893 --> 00:10:55,603
Both of you grew
surprisingly quickly

212
00:10:55,687 --> 00:10:57,355
while you were training here.

213
00:10:57,439 --> 00:10:59,566
So, this is a good
workout for me, as well.

214
00:10:59,649 --> 00:11:01,484
[LEOPOLD, LUCK yell]

215
00:11:01,568 --> 00:11:05,280
[GAJA] Just as they have, I,
too, must become stronger.

216
00:11:05,363 --> 00:11:07,282
I will protect
the Heart Kingdom,

217
00:11:07,365 --> 00:11:09,909
even if it costs my life.

218
00:11:09,993 --> 00:11:12,328
[LOROPECHIKA] You and the other
Magic Knights are so nice.

219
00:11:12,412 --> 00:11:14,122
I worried you might not be.

220
00:11:14,205 --> 00:11:16,458
To be honest, I was a bit
intimidated by the prospect

221
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:18,376
of our initial meeting.

222
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,836
[NOELLE]
You were intimidated?

223
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:22,297
We're the ones who got
ambushed when we arrived.

224
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,424
Even if it was to check
our magic stages.

225
00:11:24,507 --> 00:11:26,301
[LOROPECHIKA laughs]
Sorry about that.

226
00:11:26,384 --> 00:11:28,345
We understand why
it was necessary,

227
00:11:28,428 --> 00:11:30,847
and we were thrilled to find out
that the Heart Kingdom's ruler

228
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:33,808
is someone as lovely
and gracious as you.

229
00:11:33,892 --> 00:11:35,560
You're too kind.

230
00:11:35,643 --> 00:11:37,187
We could never
be as kind as you

231
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:40,065
and everyone we've met since
coming here has been to us.

232
00:11:40,148 --> 00:11:41,358
I agree.

233
00:11:41,441 --> 00:11:43,193
We're all going up against
the devil together,

234
00:11:43,276 --> 00:11:45,987
so I'm just glad that you're
an ally we can trust.

235
00:11:46,071 --> 00:11:47,530
Though I can't help
wishing you weren't

236
00:11:47,614 --> 00:11:50,367
so incredibly
clumsy all the time.

237
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:51,743
Noelle.

238
00:11:51,826 --> 00:11:54,579
Yes, well, thank you
very much for saying that.

239
00:11:54,662 --> 00:11:56,956
I'm trying hard to put on
a brave face for my people

240
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,668
so they can feel confident in
their queen despite the troubles

241
00:11:59,751 --> 00:12:03,380
we're facing, but it's not easy,
and I often fear I'm failing.

242
00:12:03,463 --> 00:12:05,799
So it's a comfort to know that
there are people like you

243
00:12:05,882 --> 00:12:08,885
who I can be honest with about
my hopes and my doubts

244
00:12:08,968 --> 00:12:10,220
I guess what I'm trying to say

245
00:12:10,303 --> 00:12:12,514
is that I'm happy
we became friends.

246
00:12:13,932 --> 00:12:15,809
You're so cute, Loropechika.

247

[NOELLE]
Oh, come on, it's no big deal.

Now stop, you're gonna
make me blush.

is scrumdiddlyumptious!

here to talk to you about.

not get the chance.

Oh? So, is that
why you came here,

to tell me to stop eating?

When I'm done, this may be
my ultimate masterpiece.

466
00:23:31,693 --> 00:23:33,695
Whoa, that's not a canvas.

467
00:23:33,778 --> 00:23:34,738
[RILL]
Finished!

468
00:23:34,821 --> 00:23:37,365
At last, my goddess
has descended!

469
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:38,658
Wait a minute.

470
00:23:38,742 --> 00:23:41,244
How did you not notice
where you were painting?

471
00:23:41,327 --> 00:23:42,954
If you eat any more,
you're going to stretch

472
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:44,497
my goddess out. For her sake,

473
00:23:44,581 --> 00:23:46,499
I'm begging you,
put the bananas down!

474
00:23:46,583 --> 00:23:48,793
Rill. Be careful.
You know what happens

475
00:23:48,877 --> 00:23:51,129
to people who stand
between me and my food.

476
00:23:51,212 --> 00:23:53,715
[ASTA screams]
Please, not this again, Charmy!

477
00:23:53,798 --> 00:23:55,300
I can't take it!

478
00:23:57,427 --> 00:23:58,720
[YUNO]
You're joking, right?

479
00:23:58,803 --> 00:24:00,889
You can't be serious
about me being the prince

480
00:24:00,972 --> 00:24:02,057
of the Spade Kingdom.

481
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,892
[RALPH]
I'm very serious.

"The Messenger from

You are my prince.
