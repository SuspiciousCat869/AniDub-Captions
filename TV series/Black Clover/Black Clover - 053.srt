I was a nobleman's

Until I was eight years old,
I lived in the Forsaken Realm.

But then the
nobleman's heir passed away,

he summoned me--brought me into
his house to be his successor.

309
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,333
Fortunately,
I possessed great power,

310
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:07,500
and my Magic was a curiosity.

311
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:10,541
But even there,
my face was despised,

312
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:12,708
and the nobleman's wife,
my foster mother,

313
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:14,875
treated me cruelly.

314
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:18,333
I wouldn't wish the sort of
childhood I had on anyone.

you've been through a lot.

also when I met Julius.

to my appearance,

318
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:31,291

[clapping]

321
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,041
Incredible!

322
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:43,041
What was that magic
you were just using?

323
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:44,708
[WILLIAM]
Um. World Tree Magic.

324
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:46,583
Now there's a marvelous name!

325
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,833
And well-suited for
such marvelous magic.

326
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:50,958
I've never seen
anything like it.

327
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:52,000
Um.

328
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:57,083
Truly. It's such a lovely spell.

329
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:59,291
Like you want to
safeguard everything.

330
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,375
Wrap it in kindness.

331

[WILLIAM grunts]

332

Now, then, you
absolutely must become

00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:06,208
a Magic Knight.

334
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:07,458
But...

335
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:10,125
N-No?

336
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:12,208
It's not that
I don't want to, but...

337
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:13,458
The Magic Knights?

338
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:16,291
I never thought
I could join them.

339
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:19,166
I mean, with this face.

340
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,083
Now, now, that isn't
anything to worry about.

341
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:23,750
[gasps]
What?

342
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:25,166
I'm serious.

343
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,541
Your face isn't something you
ought to be ashamed of.

344
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:30,041
However, if it bothers
you that much...

345
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,041
[gasp]

346
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:33,041
[JULIUS]
Well, in that case...

347
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,791
I'll give you this mask!

348
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,583
[WILLIAM] But Julius, sir,
this is so tacky.

349
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:46,916
[yelps]
But I worked on it so hard!

350
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:50,250
[WILLIAM] I was happy,
and I vowed to devote

351
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:53,375
my grimoire to his service.

352
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:56,291
[YAMI]
Now that's a familiar story.

353
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:59,583
His face and bearing both
resemble the Light mage's.

354
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:03,875
But I'm not picking up any trace
of power in those scars.

355
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:06,125
No tricks at work here.

356
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:09,208
He's not showing me an illusion,
and more than that.

357
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:11,916
His ki tells me he's not lying.

358
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,708
So I guess the resemblance
is purely coincidence.

359
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:17,500
[YAMI]
Right, well, sorry.

360
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:21,666
No. I'm glad I got the chance
to show you who I am.

361
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,500
Thank you, Yami.

362
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,291
Sure thing.

363
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,083
[KLAUS] Captain Vangeance,
do you read me?

364
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:29,291
The Diamond Kingdom
has begun to retreat!

365
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:31,833
Very good.
Don't pursue those who flee.

366
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:34,833
Concentrate all your efforts on
healing the injured.

367
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:36,708
[KLAUS]
Understood.

368
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:38,166
[WILLIAM]
We should get to work.

369
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,916
With the number of
prisoners we've captured,

370
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,750
transporting them
all will be difficult.

371
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,000
[YAMI]
Yeah.

372
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:44,666
Oh, hey, I got a guy
who comes in real handy

373
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:48,041
for that kinda thing.
And we can work him hard.

374
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:49,708
[WILLIAM chuckles]
Not too hard, now.

375
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:53,666
[FINRAL sneezes] Some sweet lady
must be talking about me.

376
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,666
I guess things have gotten
pretty quiet.

377
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,625
We should probably go look for
the captain.

00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:03,250
Yeah. Bye, Asta.

381

Don't eat stuff you
find on the ground.

I was wondering
if there was a way I could

I actually said that!

a fight with the best one?

you got a headache or something?

Didn't they hear
what I said? Whoa!

There's nothing like a

You should really choose your
friends more carefully, Yuno.

Should you have said
a better goodbye?

I thought you and that

The Wizard King?

Ha! That's ridiculous!

to say it, are you?

just don't feel shame,
