Threatened by a ruthless demon,

00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,476
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:32,105 --> 00:00:34,357
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:34,441 --> 00:00:37,027
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:43,491 --> 00:00:45,452
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:45,535 --> 00:00:49,706
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:51,082 --> 00:00:52,876
[NARRATOR] With elf spirits
possessing the bodies

00:00:52,959 --> 00:00:55,128
of Magic Knights
and attacking humans,

9
00:00:55,211 --> 00:00:58,548
the royal capital found
itself mired in chaos.

10
00:00:58,631 --> 00:01:01,092
Inside the Eye of the
Midnight Sun's hideout,

11
00:01:01,176 --> 00:01:03,011
Luck and some of the
others turned against

12
00:01:03,094 --> 00:01:05,805
their fellow Royal Knights,
and Asta's words

13
00:01:05,889 --> 00:01:07,682
about finding common
ground weren't enough

14
00:01:07,766 --> 00:01:09,559
to convince Rhya
to stop the violence

15
00:01:09,642 --> 00:01:11,311
from unfolding further.

Let's foster understanding.

17
00:01:14,147 --> 00:01:16,775
[RHYA] There were no lies
in anything that he said,

18
00:01:16,858 --> 00:01:21,780
and so I trusted him.
And what did it get me?

19
00:01:21,863 --> 00:01:23,323
That.

20
00:01:24,449 --> 00:01:27,243
[RHYA] So, you see,
I'm done with trusting.

Hey, Rhya, good to see ya!

24
00:01:38,338 --> 00:01:39,714
All of them, too?

25
00:01:39,798 --> 00:01:42,217
[ZORA] We won't last five
minutes against them!

26
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,302
[NARRATOR] After pulling Asta
and Zora from the fight

27

their foes alone.

29

You seem like a benevolent
leader, Madam Royal.

30

[MEREOLEONA] You don't
understand a thing, do you?

31
00:01:54,312 --> 00:01:55,647
I sent those novices home

32
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:57,691
because they were
getting in my way.

33

Slow you down?
Don't make me laugh.

34
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:01,611
I wanted the chance

35
00:02:01,695 --> 00:02:04,322
to obliterate all
of you personally!

36
00:03:37,499 --> 00:03:39,918
What in the world's
happening out there?

37
00:03:40,001 --> 00:03:41,127
I'm not sure. All I know

38
00:03:41,211 --> 00:03:44,506
is we have to keep
Sir Fuegoleon safe!

You're useless, even as a group!

43

Please stop this!

44
00:03:59,813 --> 00:04:02,399
Not going to happen.
I'll keep fighting until

45
00:04:02,482 --> 00:04:05,694
every one of you humans
is destroyed. And besides,

46

my name's not Randall,
so stop calling me that.

We were trained

who ever lived!

known as the Crimson Lion Kings!

57

Are you sure about that?

I've saturated the entire

And, as such, you can't
even cast a proper spell!

61
00:04:49,821 --> 00:04:52,115
[LEOPOLD] Randall always used
to add air to my Flame Magic

62
00:04:52,198 --> 00:04:55,744
to fan the fire and make
my abilities more powerful.

such a tough enemy!

00:17:55,857 --> 00:17:57,734
I had hoped you would
surmise our plan

320
00:17:57,817 --> 00:18:02,739
and not come here.
I prayed for that.

321
00:18:02,822 --> 00:18:04,741
Please explain yourself!

322
00:18:04,824 --> 00:18:07,369
Tell me the truth! What plan?

323
00:18:07,452 --> 00:18:10,622
You will see,
quite soon, in fact.

324
00:18:12,749 --> 00:18:14,501
What is happening to you?

325
00:18:14,584 --> 00:18:16,628
[PATRY, WILLIAM]
No one knows my secret.

326
00:18:16,711 --> 00:18:20,757
Not even the Wizard King,
who gave me my mask.

327
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,258
[PATRY]
But you will understand things

328
00:18:22,342 --> 00:18:23,760
when you see the other me.

329
00:18:23,843 --> 00:18:26,388
Enough of this nonsense,
who are you?

330
00:18:26,471 --> 00:18:28,556
And what have you
done to William?

331
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,644
Interesting. The captain
of the Crimson Lion Kings.

332
00:18:32,727 --> 00:18:37,774
You're normally so collected,
but now even you seem shaken.

333
00:18:37,857 --> 00:18:39,859
All I need is an instant.

334
00:18:50,078 --> 00:18:51,955
[FUEGOLEON]
I have so many questions.

335
00:18:52,038 --> 00:18:54,749
Why didn't he kill me
when he had the chance?

336
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:59,254
Who was that person, and
what has become of William?

337
00:18:59,337 --> 00:19:01,923
However, I won't breathe
a word of this matter

338
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:04,759
until I can ascertain the truth.

339
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:06,553
Crimson Lion Kings!

340
00:19:06,636 --> 00:19:09,305
Clover Kingdom is
in grave danger!

341
00:19:09,389 --> 00:19:11,725
We must end this bloodshed!

342
00:19:11,808 --> 00:19:14,185
With the fires of strength
and pride that burn deep

343
00:19:14,269 --> 00:19:17,647
within our hearts, we will
strive to vanquish the enemy!

344
00:19:17,731 --> 00:19:19,858
[CRIMSON LIONS]
Yeah!

345
00:19:19,941 --> 00:19:22,360
[FUEGOLEON] The real fight
is just beginning.

346
00:19:28,658 --> 00:19:31,453
[BAVAL] Hm? These outfits
are awfully similar

347
00:19:31,536 --> 00:19:33,830
to the garment worn
by that human royal.

348
00:19:33,913 --> 00:19:35,457
That's strange, isn't it?

349
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:39,711
I'm sure the person
who gathered us here

350
00:19:39,794 --> 00:19:43,506
made that decision. Talk about
a sick sense of humor.

351
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,592
I'm not sure I follow you.

352
00:19:45,675 --> 00:19:49,012
They expect us to wipe out
the human race, obviously.

353
00:19:49,095 --> 00:19:50,722
Right, that's simple enough.

354
00:19:50,805 --> 00:19:52,390
After all, the humans killed us,

355
00:19:52,474 --> 00:19:54,100
and they've been living
the good life ever since,

356
00:19:54,184 --> 00:19:55,685
without a care in the world!

357
00:19:55,769 --> 00:19:57,604
We've got more than enough
reason to be upset,

358
00:19:57,687 --> 00:19:59,397
if you ask me.

359
00:19:59,481 --> 00:20:01,191
Oh, I see you made it.

360
00:20:01,274 --> 00:20:05,153
[LANGRIS] Well, well, well!
The gang's all here.

361
00:20:05,236 --> 00:20:08,615
I was trapped in a pretty
strange place when I awakened,

362
00:20:08,698 --> 00:20:11,117
but I had fun getting out.

363
00:20:11,201 --> 00:20:13,119
Humans infuriate me.

364
00:20:13,203 --> 00:20:15,914
Always so smug
in their stupidity.

365
00:20:15,997 --> 00:20:17,582
I'm assuming your
cousin was the one

366
00:20:17,665 --> 00:20:19,751
who brought us together,
right, Latry?

367
00:20:19,834 --> 00:20:22,253
Correct, this is
all Patry's doing.

368
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:27,384
Birds of a twisted feather
flock together, I suppose.

369
00:20:27,467 --> 00:20:28,802
I know I'm itching
to get my hands

370
00:20:28,885 --> 00:20:32,180
around the throats of those
despicable royal scum!

371
00:20:32,263 --> 00:20:34,140
The Midnight Sun has set.

372
00:20:34,224 --> 00:20:36,059
It's time to show
humankind the wrath

373
00:20:36,142 --> 00:20:38,395
of a brand-new Golden Dawn!

374
00:20:41,189 --> 00:20:44,651
[LANGRIS]
Brother. Are you there?

375
00:20:44,734 --> 00:20:48,446
[FINRAL] Langris? You're back
to normal! I'm so glad!

376
00:20:50,073 --> 00:20:53,118
[FINRAL]
Huh? Wait up! Hey, come back!

377
00:20:53,201 --> 00:20:55,245
Please don't leave! Langris!

378
00:20:55,328 --> 00:20:58,748
[FINRAL grunts]

379
00:20:58,832 --> 00:21:00,375
[FINRAL]
Ow!

380
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:02,836
What the heck was that?
And where am I?

381
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:05,505
Is my name even Finral anymore?

382
00:21:05,588 --> 00:21:08,133
How long were you plannin'
to snooze, numbskull?

383
00:21:08,216 --> 00:21:09,843
[FINRAL]
Captain Yami?!

384
00:21:11,177 --> 00:21:12,345
[YAMI]
As you can see,

385
00:21:12,429 --> 00:21:14,806
things aren't goin'
too well out there.

386
00:21:14,889 --> 00:21:16,766
You felt it, right?

387
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:18,309
That evil, inhuman power

388
00:21:18,393 --> 00:21:20,729
that your brother
was givin' off?

389
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:23,148
The stuff is everywhere now.

390
00:21:24,566 --> 00:21:27,527
Okay, then. Let's go.

391
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:30,947
[FINRAL] Langris. I'm gonna
save you this time!

Sir Fuegoleon!

395
00:23:11,464 --> 00:23:13,883
[CRIMSON LION 98A]
Thank goodness you're awake now!

396
00:23:13,967 --> 00:23:16,052
I believe there's
something I'm meant to do!

397
00:23:16,136 --> 00:23:17,178
[CRIMSON LIONS]
Right!

398
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:18,722
[CRIMSON LION 98A]
Wait, what?

399
00:23:18,805 --> 00:23:21,558
[NARRATOR] Fuegoleon Vermillion:
a man who refuses to suffer

400
00:23:21,641 --> 00:23:23,393
a single misplaced hair!

401
00:23:23,476 --> 00:23:25,061
[CRIMSON LION 98AA] Um,
not that it matters right now,

402
00:23:25,145 --> 00:23:26,521
but your hair looks great!

403
00:23:26,604 --> 00:23:27,605
In that case,

404
00:23:27,689 --> 00:23:29,441
there's something else
I'm meant to do!

405

[CRIMSON LIONS]
Right!

Come on, seriously?

every tooth not once,
but three times!

409
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:38,700
[CRIMSON LION 98AA]
Okay, I'm sure your mouth

410
00:23:38,783 --> 00:23:40,201
is clean enough, sir!

411
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:43,413
Well then, there's yet another
thing I'm meant to do!

412
00:23:43,496 --> 00:23:44,998
Five more minutes, please.

413
00:23:45,081 --> 00:23:47,334
