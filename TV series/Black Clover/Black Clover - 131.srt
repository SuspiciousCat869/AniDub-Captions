Thanks, we're really
glad to be back!

162
00:09:42,614 --> 00:09:43,823
[gasps]

163
00:09:43,907 --> 00:09:45,575
[LAMMY]
Is that them?

164
00:09:48,119 --> 00:09:49,704
Whoa, easy!

165
00:09:50,789 --> 00:09:53,249
[PARUM]
Yay! They really came home!

166
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:54,626
[LAMMY]
We missed you!

167
00:09:54,709 --> 00:09:57,921
Asta, have you grown up
at all? You're still short.

168
00:09:58,004 --> 00:09:59,172
I have!

169
00:09:59,255 --> 00:10:01,966
But obviously, you're as
cool as always, Yuno.

170
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:05,470
Actually, Yuno's more than cool,
he's also extremely cute!

171
00:10:05,553 --> 00:10:07,764
[KIDS] Wow, it's some
kind of talking doll!

172
00:10:07,847 --> 00:10:10,141
She's not a doll,
she's the Wind Spirit!

173
00:10:10,225 --> 00:10:11,768
Spirit!

174
00:10:11,851 --> 00:10:13,353
[BELL]
It's Bell.

175
00:10:13,436 --> 00:10:16,523
I'd prefer if you didn't treat
me like a toy this time, so--

176
00:10:16,606 --> 00:10:19,150
They brought us a pretty
doll to play with, yay!

177
00:10:19,234 --> 00:10:22,320
Aw, she's so neat,
let me hold her!

178
00:10:22,404 --> 00:10:23,488
We're gonna have so much fun...

179
00:10:23,571 --> 00:10:27,158
[BELL]
What did I just say? Yuno, help!

180
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:30,954
[LILY]
Asta. Yuno.

181
00:10:33,498 --> 00:10:37,877
[LILY] You're both safe.
Oh, that makes me so happy!

182
00:10:37,961 --> 00:10:39,629
Sister Lily.

183
00:10:47,971 --> 00:10:50,348
Will you please marry me?!

184
00:10:51,433 --> 00:10:54,352
[ASTA]
Will you please marry me?!

185
00:10:54,436 --> 00:10:57,647
[VILLAGER 1B sighs] Of course.
Some things never change.

186
00:10:57,731 --> 00:10:59,357
Yeah, back when Asta
lived in the village,

187
00:10:59,441 --> 00:11:02,027
we'd hear marriage
proposals every day.

188
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:06,114
[NOELLE sighs] I think I finally
got the hang of this thing.

189
00:11:06,197 --> 00:11:08,783
[ASTA]
Will you please marry me?!

190
00:11:08,867 --> 00:11:11,619
[yelps] Asta's proposing?

191
00:11:11,703 --> 00:11:14,372
Come on, you can't just spring
that on me out of nowhere!

192
00:11:14,456 --> 00:11:17,375
[screams]

193
00:11:19,044 --> 00:11:22,005
[ASTA grunts]
Yep, just like I remember.

194
00:11:22,088 --> 00:11:25,300
Uh... Old habit. Sorry.

195
00:11:25,383 --> 00:11:26,384
[gasps]

196
00:11:26,468 --> 00:11:28,762
[screaming]

197
00:11:31,389 --> 00:11:34,267
[NOELLE coughs]
You clumsy moron!

198
00:11:34,351 --> 00:11:36,811
How dare you get in the way
of my perfect broom landing?

199
00:11:36,895 --> 00:11:38,396
Uh...

200
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,898
As for your proposal.

201
00:11:39,981 --> 00:11:43,693
Um. Well. I'm not sure
how to respond to that.

202
00:11:43,777 --> 00:11:45,487
It's so sudden.

203
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:46,488
[ASTA]
Huh?

204
00:11:46,571 --> 00:11:48,031
Hello, young lady.

205
00:11:48,114 --> 00:11:50,825
Judging by that robe, I assume
you're one of Asta's cohorts

206
00:11:50,909 --> 00:11:51,701
from the Black Bulls.

207
00:11:51,785 --> 00:11:52,994
Yes, sir.

208
00:11:53,078 --> 00:11:55,705
We appreciate you keeping
an eye on Asta here.

209
00:11:55,789 --> 00:11:57,082
You must be Noelle.

210
00:11:57,165 --> 00:11:58,917
He sends us letters
about his adventures,

211
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,960
and your name comes
up pretty often.

212
00:12:01,044 --> 00:12:03,880
Letters? Is that true?

213
00:12:05,131 --> 00:12:06,508
[NOELLE]
This is a surprise.

214
00:12:06,591 --> 00:12:09,469
What could he possibly
be telling them about me?

215
00:12:09,552 --> 00:12:12,097
Maybe it's like...

216
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:15,058
I've got my heart set
on a very special lady.

217
00:12:15,141 --> 00:12:18,728
Her name's Noelle.

218
00:12:18,812 --> 00:12:20,563
Don't say that stuff!

219
00:12:20,647 --> 00:12:22,691
What stuff?

220
00:12:24,192 --> 00:12:26,945
[SECRÉ]
What are they yelling about now?

221
00:12:27,028 --> 00:12:27,987
[HIGH PRIEST]
Excuse me, miss,

222
00:12:28,071 --> 00:12:30,198
are you also with
the Black Bulls?

223
00:12:30,281 --> 00:12:31,449
[gasps]

224
00:12:31,533 --> 00:12:32,575
[ASTA]
Oh, yeah!

225
00:12:32,659 --> 00:12:34,911
That's Nero, our
newest squad member!

226
00:12:34,994 --> 00:12:36,413
Nice to meet you!

227
00:12:36,496 --> 00:12:40,792
We hope you'll continue
to look after Asta for us.

228
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:42,419
I'll do my best.

229
00:12:42,502 --> 00:12:43,962
By the way.

230
00:12:44,045 --> 00:12:46,715
I understand you just got here,
but I do have a small favor

231
00:12:46,798 --> 00:12:49,175
to ask of you boys,
if it isn't too much.

232
00:12:49,259 --> 00:12:50,093
Of course.

233
00:12:50,176 --> 00:12:51,219
Anything!

234
00:12:51,302 --> 00:12:53,388
Whatever you want,
I'll make it happen!

235
00:12:58,935 --> 00:13:03,732
[KIDS laughing]

236
00:13:03,815 --> 00:13:06,735
[LILY] Well, it would
really mean a lot to me

237
00:13:06,818 --> 00:13:08,153
if you could come
and work as teachers

238
00:13:08,236 --> 00:13:09,904
at the magic school for the day.

239
00:13:09,988 --> 00:13:12,782
Uh. Me and Yuno?

240
00:13:12,866 --> 00:13:13,992
As teachers?

241
00:13:14,075 --> 00:13:15,994
[LILY]
Mm-hm! They look up to you

242
00:13:16,077 --> 00:13:18,413
like everyone else in
the Clover Kingdom does.

243
00:13:18,496 --> 00:13:20,206
So I think it would
be a lovely memory

244
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:23,543
for them to receive a lesson
from some real Magic Knights.

245
00:13:27,964 --> 00:13:31,593
They've grown up so much.
It warms my heart!

246
00:13:32,886 --> 00:13:34,554
Teacher Asta!

247
00:13:34,637 --> 00:13:36,264
Teacher Yuno!

248
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:37,640
[HORO]
Teacher!

249
00:13:37,724 --> 00:13:40,018
Teacher.

250
00:13:40,101 --> 00:13:41,686
All right, watch and learn!

251
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:43,646
I'm gonna teach you kids
everything you need to know

252
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:45,482
to be awesome Magic Knights!

253
00:13:45,565 --> 00:13:46,399
[gasps]

254
00:13:46,483 --> 00:13:48,485
[KIDS]
Ooh!

255
00:13:49,986 --> 00:13:52,864
Lesson one!
Magic equals muscles!

256
00:13:52,947 --> 00:13:53,907
[KIDS]
Ooh!

257
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,742
I'm afraid I don't follow you.

258
00:13:55,825 --> 00:13:58,703
Since you guys are little,
you don't have much mana yet.

259
00:13:58,787 --> 00:14:01,081
But there's one way
you can make up for it!

260
00:14:01,164 --> 00:14:02,540
That's right! With muscles!

261
00:14:02,624 --> 00:14:04,125
[KIDS cheer]

262
00:14:04,209 --> 00:14:06,336
So you gotta train really hard!

263
00:14:06,419 --> 00:14:08,963
Starting right now!
Let's run laps!

264
00:14:09,047 --> 00:14:10,048
[yells]

265
00:14:10,131 --> 00:14:14,511
[KIDS yell]

266
00:14:14,594 --> 00:14:16,638
Interesting teaching style.

267
00:14:18,723 --> 00:14:20,517
[GROUP]
Teacher Yuno!

268
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,851
While Asta's busy with that,

269
00:14:21,935 --> 00:14:24,145
would you mind being the
girls' instructor, please?

270
00:14:24,229 --> 00:14:25,522
I'm not sure.

271
00:14:25,605 --> 00:14:27,023
It's all right,
you don't need to place

272
00:14:27,107 --> 00:14:29,567
too much importance on
teaching them specific things.

273
00:14:29,651 --> 00:14:32,153
Just playing with them
for a while is good enough.

274
00:14:32,237 --> 00:14:34,030
So I'm babysitting.

275
00:14:34,114 --> 00:14:35,490
Yes, I'm sure the
children will learn

276
00:14:35,573 --> 00:14:38,076
a thing or two simply
by observing you.

277
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:39,494
Yeah, I guess.

278
00:14:39,577 --> 00:14:42,163
Teacher Yuno.
I wanna play house!

279
00:14:42,247 --> 00:14:44,666
That sounds... great.

280
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:52,841
[NOELLE]
Why do I have to be the baby?

281
00:14:52,924 --> 00:14:55,176
I mean, I'm royalty!

282
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:58,847
[PARUM] Aw, Noelle!
You're a cute baby!

283
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:00,849
Yeah? You think so?

284
00:15:00,932 --> 00:15:03,560
[NOELLE] If I'm doing it,
I might as well do it right.

285
00:15:03,643 --> 00:15:07,355
Okay, I'm a baby! Here goes!

286
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:09,607
[NOELLE]
Wah! Wah!

287
00:15:09,691 --> 00:15:11,359
See, you can do it!

288
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:13,611
Mama, get her to stop crying!

289
00:15:13,695 --> 00:15:15,822
Me? Okay.

290
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:19,492
Um, there, there.

291
00:15:19,576 --> 00:15:21,036
That's not how you be a mom!

292
00:15:21,119 --> 00:15:23,121
You're supposed to be
nicer to your kid!

293
00:15:23,204 --> 00:15:25,290
[YUNO]
Be nicer?

294
00:15:25,373 --> 00:15:27,751
[gasps] Sister!

295
00:15:27,834 --> 00:15:29,669
Remember what I said.

296
00:15:29,753 --> 00:15:31,212
The children learn
by watching you,

297
00:15:31,296 --> 00:15:33,715
so you need to
take this seriously!

298
00:15:35,216 --> 00:15:36,926
Right, I'll do that.

299
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:45,310
[YUNO] Now, now,
little one. Mommy's here.

300
00:15:45,393 --> 00:15:49,898
There's no need to cry.
Ah, you must be hungry, right?

301
00:15:49,981 --> 00:15:52,275
Let me give you some milk.
There you go.

302
00:15:52,359 --> 00:15:53,693
[NOELLE]
Mm...

303
00:15:53,777 --> 00:15:58,865
[YUNO laughs] Aw, is it good?
Go on, drink some more.

304
00:15:58,948 --> 00:16:02,869
Oh, goodness, Parum, you've got
some ketchup on your face!

305
00:16:02,952 --> 00:16:04,954
You little rascal!

306
00:16:05,038 --> 00:16:09,209
What am I going to do with you?
I wonder who you take after.

307
00:16:09,292 --> 00:16:10,418
Must be that papa...

308
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:12,128
[HIGH PRIEST]
Look at him, playing house!

309
00:16:12,212 --> 00:16:13,630
What a sweet boy!

310
00:16:13,713 --> 00:16:15,298
Though I can't imagine
what those children

311
00:16:15,382 --> 00:16:17,676
are going to take
away from this.

312
00:16:20,011 --> 00:16:23,098
[HIGH PRIEST]
This is the "new leaves" class.

313
00:16:23,181 --> 00:16:24,933
They're working hard
to prepare for the day

314
00:16:25,016 --> 00:16:26,518
when they get their grimoires.

315
00:16:26,601 --> 00:16:29,688
Oh, the awarding ceremony.

316
00:16:29,771 --> 00:16:32,107
It feels like forever
since we had ours,

317
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:34,984
but I guess it wasn't
really that long ago.

318
00:16:35,068 --> 00:16:36,736
Not at all.

319
00:16:42,992 --> 00:16:45,036
That's it! Good job, guys!

320
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,287
I know them!

321
00:16:46,371 --> 00:16:47,622
Yeah.

322
00:16:51,001 --> 00:16:52,043
That's enough.

323
00:16:52,127 --> 00:16:55,130
Wonderful job!
I'm so proud of you!

324
00:16:55,213 --> 00:16:58,717
It looks like all that studying
is starting to pay off!

325
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,926
Keep it up!

326
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:01,428
--[ELDER KIDS] Yes, sir!
--[REKKA] All right!

327
00:17:01,511 --> 00:17:03,513
[TEEN BOY 1A]
Hm?

328
00:17:03,596 --> 00:17:04,472
[TEEN BOY 1B gasps]

329
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:06,850
Well, if it isn't Yuno and Asta!

330
00:17:06,933 --> 00:17:08,977
It's really great
to see you again!

331
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,979
[ALL]
You guys! We've missed you!

332
00:17:11,062 --> 00:17:12,397
Yuno!

333
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:16,860
[TEEN BOY 1A] Sorry for
how we acted back then.

334
00:17:16,943 --> 00:17:19,654
The truth is, when we saw
how great you became,

335
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:21,489
we decided to turn
over a new leaf

336
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:23,408
and work as assistant
teachers here.

337
00:17:23,491 --> 00:17:24,868
[ASTA]
They're good guys now?

338
00:17:24,951 --> 00:17:26,494
Did you hit your
heads or something?

339
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:27,412
[TEEN BOYS]
Hm?

340
00:17:27,495 --> 00:17:28,955
[clatter]

341
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,541
Oh! Headmaster!

342
00:17:31,624 --> 00:17:33,585
Who's the headmaster?

343
00:17:33,668 --> 00:17:37,922
Hey! That's the old guy
who gives out the grimoires!

344
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:40,258
Hello, boys!

345
00:17:40,342 --> 00:17:42,218
Good to see you
back in the village.

346
00:17:42,302 --> 00:17:44,971
I've heard about all your
astounding accomplishments.

347
00:17:45,055 --> 00:17:47,057
You've made us quite proud!

348
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,434
The great things you've done
have motivated the children

349
00:17:49,517 --> 00:17:52,145
to work hard in
their study of magic.

350
00:17:52,228 --> 00:17:55,148
That's why this
school was opened!

351
00:17:55,231 --> 00:17:57,817
We've really made
a difference, huh?

352
00:17:57,901 --> 00:17:59,986
Now then, the
Grimoire Tower is home

353
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,905
to a multitude of
powerful grimoires,

354
00:18:01,988 --> 00:18:04,616
each one waiting to be
awarded to its future master.

355
00:18:04,699 --> 00:18:07,285
However, no two tomes are alike.

356
00:18:07,369 --> 00:18:09,537
They vary in size and thickness.

357
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:11,790
But you children will
be the ones to increase

358
00:18:11,873 --> 00:18:14,793
the number and potency
of the spells within them.

359
00:18:14,876 --> 00:18:18,213
With a bit of hard work,
you can be anything you wish!

360
00:18:18,296 --> 00:18:22,342
You can even emulate
these courageous heroes.

361
00:18:22,425 --> 00:18:23,635
Aw.

362
00:18:23,718 --> 00:18:26,304
My dream for this village
is that some of you

363
00:18:26,388 --> 00:18:28,932
boys and girls will follow in
Yuno's and Asta's footsteps

364
00:18:29,015 --> 00:18:32,686
and grow up to become brave
Magic Knights, like they are!

365
00:18:32,769 --> 00:18:34,688
So don't let me down!

366
00:18:34,771 --> 00:18:36,356
[ELDER KIDS]
Okay!

367
00:18:39,067 --> 00:18:40,527
[LILY]
I see.

368
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:43,029
So you'll be leaving us first
thing in the morning, then.

369
00:18:43,113 --> 00:18:44,739
[HIGH PRIEST] We'll be
throwing a big party tonight,

370
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:46,616
with all the pop
potatoes you can eat!

371
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,993
I know you boys are
excited about that.

372
00:18:49,077 --> 00:18:50,954
Yeah!

373
00:18:51,037 --> 00:18:52,914
Miss Noelle, I hope
you and Miss Nero

374
00:18:52,997 --> 00:18:55,083
will be able to join us
for the festivities.

375
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:56,835
Sure. Thanks a lot.

376
00:18:56,918 --> 00:18:59,921
[NOELLE] I know it'll dry
my mouth out again, though.

377
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:02,382
[ASTA]
Huh? That looks like Nash.

378
00:19:02,465 --> 00:19:05,135
Hey! Wait up!

379
00:19:05,218 --> 00:19:06,344
[gasps]

380
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:09,514
Oh, it's just Asta.

381
00:19:09,597 --> 00:19:11,433
Aw, don't give me that!

382
00:19:11,516 --> 00:19:14,519
Anyway, how come I didn't see
you at the magic school earlier?

383
00:19:14,602 --> 00:19:15,645
D'ya skip?

384
00:19:15,729 --> 00:19:17,397
There was something
I needed to do.

385
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,149
Oh, yeah, and what was that?

386
00:19:19,232 --> 00:19:21,526
Mind your own
business, all right?

387
00:19:21,609 --> 00:19:23,862
Hey, don't just
run away from me!

388
00:19:23,945 --> 00:19:26,740
Come back! You shouldn't
be playing hooky!

389
00:19:26,823 --> 00:19:28,324
Don't worry.

390
00:19:28,408 --> 00:19:31,619
There haven't been any issues
with Nash's attendance at all.

391
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:33,038
Right.

392
00:19:33,121 --> 00:19:35,248
We're pretending we don't
know what he's been up to.

393
00:19:35,331 --> 00:19:36,291
[LILY]
I'm sure you remember

394
00:19:36,374 --> 00:19:38,251
how much he admires Asta.

395
00:19:38,335 --> 00:19:41,171
After you two left home, he said
he wanted to be like him

396
00:19:41,254 --> 00:19:44,424
and join the Magic
Knights one day.

397
00:19:44,507 --> 00:19:46,092
That makes sense.

398
00:19:49,137 --> 00:19:54,851
[NASH]
...298, 299, 300!

399
00:19:54,934 --> 00:19:56,144
[NASH]
Gotta chug some moguro juice

400
00:19:56,227 --> 00:19:59,814
and build up my magic power!

401
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:01,608
So gross.

402
00:20:01,691 --> 00:20:03,485
[NASH]
Little more!

403
00:20:03,568 --> 00:20:07,155
All right! My mana's
overflowing now!

404
00:20:07,238 --> 00:20:08,615
[NASH yells]

405
00:20:10,325 --> 00:20:12,786
[NASH] Even though I'm
poor and an orphan,

406
00:20:12,869 --> 00:20:14,621
I'll prove that
I can be more amazing

407
00:20:14,704 --> 00:20:16,623
than anyone else in the world!

408
00:20:16,706 --> 00:20:18,458
Just like Asta!

409
00:20:22,295 --> 00:20:25,799
[SECRÉ] My prince, please
keep watching over them.

410
00:20:25,882 --> 00:20:28,426
This kingdom has
a bright future.

411
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,761
I can tell!

412
00:20:33,264 --> 00:20:35,558
[VILLAGER 131AA] I thought I'd
bring over some pop-potatoes!

413
00:20:35,642 --> 00:20:37,852
Those boys must be
starving from their trip!

414
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:39,145
Thank you.

415
00:20:39,229 --> 00:20:40,689
[VILLAGER 131A]
Do you need some help, Father?

416
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:42,816
I can peel that
for you if you like.

417
00:20:42,899 --> 00:20:44,609
[HIGH PRIEST]
You're too kind.

418
00:20:44,693 --> 00:20:46,903
Good grief.

419
00:20:46,986 --> 00:20:49,280
Where did Asta run off to?

420
00:20:49,364 --> 00:20:50,657
[NOELLE]
Scratch that.

421
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,450
What I really wanna know
is what he wrote about me

422
00:20:52,534 --> 00:20:54,411
in all those letters home!

423
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:04,713
[YUNO]
Come here to cry?

424
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:07,757
What? Hey! You can
see I'm not crying!

425
00:21:07,841 --> 00:21:08,967
[YUNO]
Hm.

426
00:21:11,219 --> 00:21:13,430
[ASTA]
I'm just happy.

427
00:21:13,513 --> 00:21:16,057
We were both orphans,
but unlike you,

428
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:18,768
I was the kid who
had no magic power.

429
00:21:18,852 --> 00:21:21,771
I got made fun of all the time.

430
00:21:21,855 --> 00:21:23,106
Then...

431
00:21:23,189 --> 00:21:24,357
Hello, boys!

432
00:21:24,441 --> 00:21:26,234
Good to see you
back in the village.

433
00:21:26,317 --> 00:21:27,318
I've heard about all your...

434
00:21:27,402 --> 00:21:29,154
[ASTA]
"...astounding accomplishments.

435
00:21:29,237 --> 00:21:31,114
You've made us quite proud!"

436
00:21:31,197 --> 00:21:32,782
That felt good.

437
00:21:32,866 --> 00:21:35,035
[YUNO]
Of course it did.

438
00:21:35,118 --> 00:21:36,411
Because we really
have accomplished

439
00:21:36,494 --> 00:21:39,122
a lot of great things.

440
00:21:39,205 --> 00:21:41,583
We've proven that,
with hard work,

441
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:43,793
you can become
anything you want.

442
00:21:43,877 --> 00:21:47,005
But still, our story's
not over yet.

443
00:21:47,088 --> 00:21:49,507
It's only the beginning, Asta.

444
00:21:49,591 --> 00:21:51,801
[ASTA] Yeah. If we're
about to go up against

445
00:21:51,885 --> 00:21:54,596
the Spade Kingdom...

446
00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:56,681
[YUNO]
...and the devils,

447
00:21:56,765 --> 00:22:00,518
the only way we'll succeed is by
making ourselves even stronger.

448
00:22:00,602 --> 00:22:02,812
[ASTA]
Let's protect everyone.

449
00:22:02,896 --> 00:22:05,899
[YUNO]
And keep moving forward.

450
00:22:05,982 --> 00:22:08,526
You think we're
ready for this, Yuno?

451
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:09,903
I know I am.

452
00:22:09,986 --> 00:22:13,448
I'm gonna be better than
you can even comprehend.

453
00:22:13,531 --> 00:22:16,201
[ASTA] Well, for now,
I'd say we're about equal.

454
00:22:16,284 --> 00:22:19,746
Heh. Sure, whatever.

455
00:23:56,885 --> 00:23:58,803
[YUNO]
I'm the next Wizard King.

456
00:23:58,887 --> 00:24:00,513
No matter what obstacles
stand in my way,

457
00:24:00,597 --> 00:24:02,015
I'll overcome them all.

458
00:24:02,098 --> 00:24:04,017
I'll grow stronger.

459

<i>Black Clover</i> , Page 132:
"The Lion Awakens."

460
00:24:07,937 --> 00:24:10,231
I'm not the only one
trying to improve.
