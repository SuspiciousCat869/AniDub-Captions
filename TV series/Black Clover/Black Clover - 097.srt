Mine was clearly the
more devastating one,

Even if it just hit my gauntlet,

And after the mission
resulted in failure,

you placed the blame on me,

You have no right to judge
the behavior of a captain,

00:09:51,289 --> 00:09:54,125
And their magic power
disappeared with them?

160
00:09:54,209 --> 00:09:57,295
In that case. I'll tear
apart this whole area!

161
00:10:01,508 --> 00:10:02,425
[gasps]

162
00:10:04,969 --> 00:10:06,638
[REVCHI]
Chain Creation Magic:

163
00:10:06,721 --> 00:10:09,224
Magic-Binding Iron
Chain Formation!

164
00:10:09,307 --> 00:10:11,893
[MAGIC KNIGHT 97A] Did he just
seal away my magic power?

165
00:10:11,976 --> 00:10:15,355
Impossible, my strength
is far superior to theirs!

166
00:10:15,438 --> 00:10:17,941
What kind of
techniques are those?

167
00:10:18,024 --> 00:10:20,944
Now that he's taken care of,
we should be home free!

168
00:10:21,027 --> 00:10:22,654
Finally, these poor eyes of mine

169
00:10:22,737 --> 00:10:25,073
will see the light
of day once more!

170
00:10:25,156 --> 00:10:26,241
Indeed.

171
00:10:26,324 --> 00:10:28,702
I knew it wasn't my
fate to die in here.

172
00:10:28,785 --> 00:10:31,746
Revchi, let us make haste
to clear our sullied names,

173
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:32,831
once and for all.

174
00:10:32,914 --> 00:10:34,958
Excellent idea!

175
00:10:42,549 --> 00:10:45,427
You guys, what's wrong?

176
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:48,138
It's just like with
Vetto and the others.

177
00:10:48,221 --> 00:10:50,306
It feels so evil.

178
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:53,852
Why's that kind of magic
power coming from you?

179
00:10:56,646 --> 00:10:58,023
[giggles]

180
00:11:06,072 --> 00:11:08,950
Why's that kind of magic
power coming from you?

181
00:11:09,034 --> 00:11:10,493
[KIRSCH]
Noelle's right.

182
00:11:10,577 --> 00:11:13,872
There's something terribly
malicious at play here.

183
00:11:13,955 --> 00:11:17,042
Much like that
House Vaude fellow.

184
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:19,711
An ominous aura, indeed!

185
00:11:27,594 --> 00:11:31,097
[BEN]
Finally, we've made it back.

186
00:11:31,181 --> 00:11:32,849
Let me kill them.

187
00:11:32,932 --> 00:11:37,771
[BEN chuckles] You're energetic,
considering you just awakened.

188
00:11:37,854 --> 00:11:40,315
Yeah, that's why I'm so pumped.

189
00:11:40,398 --> 00:11:42,734
Extra-pumped, actually.

190
00:11:46,363 --> 00:11:47,697
Oh, dear.

191
00:11:47,781 --> 00:11:49,866
[LUCK]
This thing is in the way.

192
00:11:54,329 --> 00:11:57,499
Luck. I don't get it.
What are you...?

193
00:12:00,543 --> 00:12:01,670
[NOELLE gasps]

194
00:12:01,753 --> 00:12:04,089
Eh. I was hoping they'd
be a challenge, but...

195
00:12:04,172 --> 00:12:06,383
They <i>are</i> humans.

196
00:12:06,466 --> 00:12:07,759
[NOELLE gasps]

197
00:12:16,059 --> 00:12:19,604
I missed ya! Looks like
I've gotten a little rusty.

198
00:12:19,688 --> 00:12:20,855
[BEN chuckles]

199
00:12:20,939 --> 00:12:22,482
Let's try again.

200
00:12:22,565 --> 00:12:23,817
[KIRSCH]
Cherry Blossom Magic:

201
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:28,154
Raging Magic Cherry
Blossom Storm of Petals!

202
00:12:28,238 --> 00:12:30,448
I don't know what caused
this change in them,

203
00:12:30,532 --> 00:12:34,577
but they certainly aren't
the people they were before.

204
00:12:34,661 --> 00:12:37,831
You should prepare yourself
to fight beautifully, Noelle!

205
00:12:37,914 --> 00:12:39,749
But... it's Luck.

206
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,751
He's a member of
the Black Bulls.

207
00:12:41,835 --> 00:12:42,877
He's my friend!

208
00:12:42,961 --> 00:12:44,087
Noelle!

209
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:47,048
[LUCK]
Hm... I can't see.

210
00:12:47,132 --> 00:12:49,592
Which means there's no
point in trying to aim.

211
00:12:49,676 --> 00:12:51,094
That's okay.

212
00:12:55,223 --> 00:12:56,766
I'll try plan B.

213
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,476
His strength is growing.

214
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,395
Use a defensive spell!

215
00:13:00,478 --> 00:13:03,606
Why, Luck? Stop this!
We're friends!

216
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:07,235
Water Creation Magic:
Sea Dragon's Lair!

217
00:13:12,449 --> 00:13:13,783
[laughing]

218
00:13:13,867 --> 00:13:14,868
[gasps]

219
00:13:14,951 --> 00:13:16,286
[yells]

220
00:13:19,664 --> 00:13:20,790
Brainwashing?

221
00:13:20,874 --> 00:13:23,835
No, even the essence of
their power's changed!

222
00:13:23,918 --> 00:13:27,130
[NOELLE] Luck's fighting on
a totally different level now!

223
00:13:27,213 --> 00:13:29,549
[LUCK] Your spells have
a certain feel to them.

224
00:13:29,632 --> 00:13:31,676
Let me guess, you're royalty?

225
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,178
You don't--?

226
00:13:33,261 --> 00:13:34,763
What if we said yes?

227
00:13:34,846 --> 00:13:37,474
Would you treat my lovely
self differently then?

228
00:13:37,557 --> 00:13:38,725
I knew it.

229
00:13:38,808 --> 00:13:41,227
This fight is getting
better by the second!

230
00:13:43,063 --> 00:13:45,607
Is this guy pullin'
my leg or what?

231
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,692
[ZORA] He was overpowered
from the beginning,

232
00:13:47,776 --> 00:13:50,779
but now it feels like he's
about to blow the roof off!

233
00:13:53,156 --> 00:13:57,077
Like I said, deception
is kinda my thing.

234
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,745
And since I'm a liar,

235
00:13:58,828 --> 00:14:02,165
I can tell when other
people are lying, too.

236
00:14:02,248 --> 00:14:05,377
Look, Mr. Anti-magic.

237
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:08,171
What you said a
little while ago.

238
00:14:08,254 --> 00:14:10,757
I just want a kingdom
where all of us

239
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,967
get along and laugh together.

240
00:14:13,051 --> 00:14:15,345
And when I'm the Wizard
King, we'll have one.

241
00:14:15,428 --> 00:14:17,180
You'll see!

242
00:14:17,263 --> 00:14:19,599
[RHYA]
I know you meant every word.

243
00:14:19,683 --> 00:14:21,226
Too bad, really.

244
00:14:21,309 --> 00:14:24,187
For a split second,
I was actually moved.

245
00:14:25,897 --> 00:14:28,191
[RHYA]
Just like the last time.

246
00:14:28,274 --> 00:14:30,902
Let's foster understanding.

247
00:14:30,985 --> 00:14:33,738
[RHYA] There were no lies
in anything that he said,

248
00:14:33,822 --> 00:14:36,199
and so I trusted him.

249
00:14:36,282 --> 00:14:40,203
And what did it get me? That.

250
00:14:41,996 --> 00:14:45,542
[RHYA] So, you see,
I'm done with trusting.

251
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,919
And to make sure
you know I mean it,

252
00:14:48,003 --> 00:14:49,879
I'll kill you!

253
00:14:52,215 --> 00:14:55,135
[RHYA] Copy Light Magic:
Light Swords of Conviction.

254
00:14:55,218 --> 00:14:58,471
Copy Dark Magic:
Lightless Slash!

255
00:14:58,555 --> 00:15:01,349
[ASTA] Two different
techniques at the same time?

256
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:04,394
[MEREOLEONA]
Mana Zone: Calidos Brachium.

257
00:15:04,477 --> 00:15:05,895
Barrage spell!

258
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,159
Do you see what I'm saying now?

259
00:15:19,242 --> 00:15:20,952
To them, there is
no getting along,

260
00:15:21,036 --> 00:15:23,455
no matter how badly you want it!

261
00:15:25,123 --> 00:15:26,958
[MEREOLEONA] They're determined
to kill every one of us

262
00:15:27,042 --> 00:15:29,377
and wipe out all
of Clover Kingdom!

263
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:32,547
Maybe they are.
But I'll still win!

264
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,716
And I'll make a way
for us to get along!

265
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:37,510
The road to mutual
understanding's closed, pal.

266
00:15:37,594 --> 00:15:40,722
I don't care!
I'll open it back up!

267
00:15:40,805 --> 00:15:43,391
Fine, fine. You can try.

268
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:45,643
But you'd better make it quick.

269
00:15:45,727 --> 00:15:48,104
Otherwise, I'll kill him myself.

270
00:15:48,188 --> 00:15:49,147
Right!

271
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:51,816
Now, Calidos Brachium!

272
00:15:54,527 --> 00:15:57,113
[RHYA] If she manages to hit
me with that move of hers,

273
00:15:57,197 --> 00:15:58,281
there's no way I'm gonna

274
00:15:58,365 --> 00:16:00,909
make it out of this
place with my life.

275
00:16:00,992 --> 00:16:02,994
I better be on my toes!

276
00:16:04,537 --> 00:16:08,083
[MEREOLEONA] A combination
of Spatial and Light Magic.

277
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:11,711
[ZORA] He's usin' a Light spell
to make himself more agile.

278
00:16:12,962 --> 00:16:15,131
[RHYA] Valty's Spatial Magic
is the perfect thing

279
00:16:15,215 --> 00:16:17,509
to keep her from hitting
me with that attack.

280
00:16:17,592 --> 00:16:19,719
It's sad the ol' codger's
not around anymore,

281
00:16:19,803 --> 00:16:22,138
but at least I got
something good out of him.

282
00:16:22,222 --> 00:16:24,516
[RHYA] Copy Spatial Magic:
Myriad Black!

283
00:16:24,599 --> 00:16:26,935
Copy Light Magic:
Sky-Rending Flash!

284
00:16:27,018 --> 00:16:29,062
You can't dodge forever!

285
00:16:35,819 --> 00:16:37,946
Seriously, this jerk
is untouchable!

286
00:16:38,029 --> 00:16:40,281
[rumbling]

287
00:16:40,365 --> 00:16:41,116
Heh.

288
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:42,492
[gasps]

289
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:49,624
Rill? Is that you?

290
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,960
Hey, Rhya, good to see ya!

291
00:16:52,043 --> 00:16:54,004
I'm so happy that you're awake!

292
00:16:54,087 --> 00:16:55,463
[laughs]

293
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:00,135
Hey! Lira!

294
00:17:00,218 --> 00:17:03,221
You're just as hyperactive
as I remember!

295
00:17:03,304 --> 00:17:04,806
Why wouldn't I be?

296
00:17:04,889 --> 00:17:06,516
And you've still got that goofy,

297
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,309
spaced-out look on your face!

298
00:17:08,393 --> 00:17:09,769
[RHYA]
Can it, kid.

299
00:17:09,853 --> 00:17:12,772
[RILL giggles]

300
00:17:12,856 --> 00:17:17,318
[RILL]
Aw, Rhya, I missed you so much!

301
00:17:17,402 --> 00:17:19,904
Would ya stop bein'
a little pain already?

302
00:17:19,988 --> 00:17:22,323
I'm just really happy!

303
00:17:22,407 --> 00:17:24,367
Well, go be happy over there!

304
00:17:24,451 --> 00:17:28,747
Hey! Rill, why are you
huggin' that monster?

305
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:31,875
[RILL] You know what?
My ability has a fancy name now!

306
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:33,209
Picture Magic!

307
00:17:33,293 --> 00:17:34,669
[RHYA]
Nice!

308
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:37,172
[ASTA] You do know he's tryin'
to murder us all, right?

309
00:17:37,255 --> 00:17:39,007
Or did you forget?

310
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:41,426
Say what? I'm confused.

311
00:17:41,509 --> 00:17:43,636
You are?! We were in
the middle of a fight,

312
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,637
and suddenly you bust in

313
00:17:44,721 --> 00:17:47,474
and you guys are
all buddy-buddy!

314
00:17:47,557 --> 00:17:49,225
Do I know you?

315
00:17:49,309 --> 00:17:52,103
[gasps] What the--? Rill!

316
00:17:52,187 --> 00:17:55,857
Who's Rill? Didn't you
hear? My name's Lira.

317
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:58,485
Huh? What's goin' on?

318
00:17:58,568 --> 00:18:00,653
[ZORA]
The captain of the Aqua Deer.

319
00:18:00,737 --> 00:18:04,115
His magic power's gone
from crazy to ludicrous,

320
00:18:04,199 --> 00:18:07,202
just like Mr. Copycat
over there.

321
00:18:07,285 --> 00:18:10,121
That Spatial mage
from the Golden Dawn.

322
00:18:10,205 --> 00:18:13,541
His felt the same way.
Was that an omen?

323
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:14,542
[MEREOLEONA]
Whatever this is,

324
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:16,920
it must've boosted
their strength.

325
00:18:17,003 --> 00:18:18,630
I can tell from the
change in their auras

326
00:18:18,713 --> 00:18:20,590
that it's not brainwashing.

327
00:18:20,674 --> 00:18:21,883
That little one
doesn't recognize

328
00:18:21,966 --> 00:18:23,551
the rookie at all anymore.

329
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:25,762
Are they being possessed
by other people?

330
00:18:25,845 --> 00:18:27,430
It's me, your old friend Asta!

331
00:18:27,514 --> 00:18:29,516
You and I are both
Magic Knights, remember?

332
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:32,727
How could you possibly forget
about a big loudmouth like me?

333
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:34,145
[yells]

334
00:18:34,229 --> 00:18:38,191
Yeah. You're loud
and super annoying.

335
00:18:38,274 --> 00:18:41,319
And there's no way I would ever
have a human as a friend.

336
00:18:41,403 --> 00:18:42,696
[gasps]

337
00:18:42,779 --> 00:18:44,656
[RILL]
I know how to shut you up.

338
00:18:44,739 --> 00:18:46,741
Check out this Picture
Magic technique.

339
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:48,868
Four-Headed Lindworm.

340
00:18:56,209 --> 00:18:58,878
You're no match for me!

341
00:18:58,962 --> 00:19:00,422
[ASTA yells]

342
00:19:02,966 --> 00:19:05,927
He's obviously bein' controlled
by some enemy spell.

343
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:08,847
You should try smackin' him
with your Anti-magic sword!

344
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:10,348
Right. I'm on it.

345
00:19:10,432 --> 00:19:11,599
Sorry, guys.

346
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:13,143
You can throw whatever
you want at us,

347
00:19:13,226 --> 00:19:15,520
but it's never
gonna reach us now!

348
00:19:15,603 --> 00:19:17,564
[ZORA]
We'll see about that.

349
00:19:17,647 --> 00:19:18,940
You think I've
been standing here

350
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:21,192
twiddling my thumbs
this whole time?

351
00:19:22,736 --> 00:19:25,238
[ZORA]
Ash Trap Magic, activate!

352
00:19:25,321 --> 00:19:27,532
Oh, I see, you were
settin' somethin' up

353
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:29,826
for us, too, huh? Big deal.

354
00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:32,787
A paralyzing trap isn't
gonna help ya much.

355
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:34,247
Agh! Can't see!

356
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:36,624
But we're good at picking up
on other people's power,

357
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,293
so I'm sure we can
still wipe the floor

358
00:19:38,376 --> 00:19:39,878
with you guys either way!

359
00:19:39,961 --> 00:19:42,088
Let's see if you feel
that way after this one

360
00:19:42,172 --> 00:19:46,176
gets through with ya.
He's a magicless monster!

361
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:49,721
[ASTA yells]

362
00:19:49,804 --> 00:19:52,265
He's got Anti-magic coursing
through his whole body!

363
00:19:52,349 --> 00:19:53,641
Hey, where are you?

364
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:56,102
Now snap out of it, Rill!

365
00:20:01,149 --> 00:20:02,484
[ASTA]
Grazed him!

366
00:20:02,567 --> 00:20:05,528
It's not much, but it should
be enough to break the--

367
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:08,865
[ASTA]
Huh?

368
00:20:08,948 --> 00:20:12,744
That hurt me, ya know.
What's your problem?

369
00:20:12,827 --> 00:20:14,287
[ASTA]
It's no good!

370
00:20:14,371 --> 00:20:17,374
Man. I thought for
sure that would work.

371
00:20:17,457 --> 00:20:20,043
[RHYA] Sorry, but thanks
to Reincarnation Magic,

372
00:20:20,126 --> 00:20:24,297
we elves have been awakened
in these human forms.

373
00:20:24,381 --> 00:20:26,257
Isn't that somethin'.

374
00:20:26,341 --> 00:20:27,676
Whether you
understand it or not,

375
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:29,761
the soul-transferring
process is complete,

376
00:20:29,844 --> 00:20:32,639
which means that these
bodies belong to us now.

377
00:20:32,722 --> 00:20:35,767
[ASTA]
Reincarnation? Elves?

378
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:38,561
Quit messin' around!
Bring Rill ba--

379
00:20:43,441 --> 00:20:45,235
All of them, too?

380
00:20:45,318 --> 00:20:46,653
[ZORA]
This is bad.

381
00:20:46,736 --> 00:20:49,781
Every one of 'em's givin' off
crazy amounts of power!

382
00:20:49,864 --> 00:20:52,242
We won't last five
minutes against them!

383
00:20:54,285 --> 00:20:56,204
Time to go. Come on!

384
00:20:56,287 --> 00:20:57,831
You wanna run? Really?

385
00:20:57,914 --> 00:20:59,416
We can't just leave them!

386
00:20:59,499 --> 00:21:01,543
No way! Not yet!

387
00:21:01,626 --> 00:21:02,877
Moron.

388
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:05,213
There's nothin' we can do
to save them right now.

389
00:21:05,296 --> 00:21:07,841
That's why we should retreat
and come up with a plan!

390
00:21:07,924 --> 00:21:10,051
Bird-brained shorty.

391
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:11,761
Yeah. You're right.

392
00:21:11,845 --> 00:21:13,638
You and your dumb cool mask!

393
00:21:13,722 --> 00:21:15,473
What's the alternative?

394
00:21:15,557 --> 00:21:19,561
I know you, and you can't
kill your buddies.

395
00:21:19,644 --> 00:21:21,229
[RHYA]
Neither can you.

396
00:21:21,312 --> 00:21:22,814
But you can't get away either,

397
00:21:22,897 --> 00:21:25,567
so you two wimps
are out of options!

398
00:21:27,569 --> 00:21:29,404
This is pitiful.

399
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,575
[BOTH gasp]

400
00:21:34,868 --> 00:21:35,952
[ASTA yelps]

401
00:21:36,036 --> 00:21:36,870
[ZORA yelps]

402
00:21:36,953 --> 00:21:39,622
[BOTH yell]

403
00:21:39,706 --> 00:21:43,418
[MEREOLEONA]
Run along home now. Children.

404
00:21:43,501 --> 00:21:44,878
But, Captain--!

405
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:54,012
Ah. So you wanna stay
here and slow us down

406
00:21:54,095 --> 00:21:56,639
so they can run back with
their tails between their legs.

407
00:21:56,723 --> 00:22:00,018
You seem like a benevolent
leader, Madam Royal.

408
00:22:04,647 --> 00:22:08,151
[MEREOLEONA] Fool. You don't
understand a thing, do you?

409
00:22:08,234 --> 00:22:09,027
[RHYA]
Hm?

410
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:10,487
I sent those novices home

411
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:12,530
because they were
getting in my way.

412
00:22:12,614 --> 00:22:15,784
Slow you down?
Don't make me laugh.

413
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:16,868
I wanted the chance

414
00:22:16,951 --> 00:22:19,579
to obliterate all
of you personally!

415
00:23:56,801 --> 00:23:59,262
[MEREOLEONA] Crimson Lion Kings,
let the fire of courage

416
00:23:59,346 --> 00:24:00,638
set your hearts ablaze!

417
00:24:00,722 --> 00:24:02,474
Never give up,
even when your back

418
00:24:02,557 --> 00:24:04,142
is pressed against a wall!

419
00:24:04,225 --> 00:24:07,979
<i>Black Clover</i> , Page 98:
"The Sleeping Lion."

420
00:24:08,063 --> 00:24:11,024
How long will you slumber,
foolish brother?
