00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:03,875
From so far.

168
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:06,666
We worked together
to affect our return.

169
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,791
Though cooperation doesn't
come naturally to us.

170
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,083
If I had to give the spell
a name, I'd call it,

171
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:14,250
Super Compound Magic.

172
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:17,583
[laughs] Merging our talents
rather than vying

173
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:19,916
for dominance--
what a novel idea.

174
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,666
Well, I guess we can't
write off men entirely, huh?

175
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:23,875
Yes.

176
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:25,791
It appears they can
be useful on occasion.

177
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,791
[scoffs] This cooperation
business leaves

178
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,541
a bad taste in my mouth.

179
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:31,458
We Silver Eagles have
never been known

180
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,041
for playing well with others.

181
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,583
[NOZEL]
And yet.

182
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:38,000
It is the duty of all Magic
Knights to protect the kingdom.

183
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:41,666
If we must work together
to do that, then so be it.

184
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,083
What happened here?

185
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:45,416
[NOELLE] He's badly hurt.
Do you think you can help?

186
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,708
How horrible!

187
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:48,166
Who could do this
to a man as strong

188
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,250
as Captain Fuegoleon?

189
00:10:58,541 --> 00:10:59,958
Somebody check the others.

190
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:01,458
Are they still breathing?

191
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:03,458
Come on, Asta, wake up for me!

192
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:04,958
[grunting]

193
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:06,625
Good, he's alive!

194
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:09,208
To have brought down fighters
as strong as these three...

195
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:11,208
How powerful are they?

196
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,833
Our losses will be too high

197
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:19,083
if we continue
this fight. Retreat.

198
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:20,875
What, leaving so soon?

199
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:24,291
Mercury Magic: Rain of Silver.

200
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:29,333
Gel Magic:
Go, Sticky Salamander!

201
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:31,458
It will take a far more
powerful spell than that

202
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:32,958
to withstand my silver rain.

203
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:34,875
Think so?

204
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:36,750
Dark Magic Item.

205
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:39,333
Properties Boost: Absorb.

206
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:41,625
Woo-hoo!

207
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:43,041
That's impossible!

208
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:45,625
It's soaking up the captain's
magic like it's nothing.

209
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:46,916
[NOZEL]
But how?

210
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,375
What sort of magic item is that?

211
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:52,291
[KLAUS gasps]

212
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,666
Asta!

213
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,333
[SALLY]
And gotcha!

214
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:58,208
[GEORK]
What do you plan to do with him?

215
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:00,291
[SALLY]
It's a secret!

216
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,041
We'll leave you for now,

217
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:07,291
but remember this day,
Magic Knights.

218
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:10,041
We are the Eye
of the Midnight Sun,

219
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:14,416
and we will bring the
Clover Kingdom to its knees.

220
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:22,541
[NOELLE]
Asta!

221
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:32,583
Gel Magic:
Go, Sticky Salamander!

222
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:34,708
It will take a far more
powerful spell than that

223
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:36,208
to withstand my silver rain.

224
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:38,166
Think so?

225
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,916
Dark Magic Item.

226
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,541
Properties Boost: Absorb.

227
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,833
Woo-hoo!

228
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:46,250
That's impossible!

229
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,833
It's soaking up the captain's
magic like it's nothing.

230
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:50,125
[NOZEL]
But how?

231
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:52,625
What sort of magic item is that?

232
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:55,500
[KLAUS gasps]

233
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:57,875
Asta!

234
00:12:57,958 --> 00:12:59,625
[SALLY]
And gotcha!

235
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:01,041
[GEORK]
What do plan to do with him?

236
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:03,166
[SALLY]
It's a secret!

237
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,208
We'll leave you for now,

238
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:10,500
but remember this day,
Magic Knights.

239
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:13,291
We are the Eye
of the Midnight Sun,

240
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:17,625
and we will bring the
Clover Kingdom to its knees.

241
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,250
[NOELLE]
Asta!

242
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:29,375
They took Asta. But he...

243
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:30,208
Let's follow them!

244
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:31,875
Stop, Noelle. It won't work.

245
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:33,083
Why not?

246
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:34,875
We have no means of
tracking them and no way

247
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:37,375
to know what awaits us
if they are found.

248
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:38,250
[NOELLE]
I don't care.

249
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:40,000
Let it go.

250
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:41,666
Our priority right
now is strengthening

251
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,791
the royal capital's defenses.

252
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:46,583
For all we know, there could
be more enemies about.

253
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:48,541
We have neither time
nor magic to waste

254
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:50,333
on somebody like him.

255
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:54,750
[NOZEL] How is Fuegoleon?
Will he survive?

256
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,458
[MIMOSA] I've done all
I can with my magic,

257
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,041
but it won't be enough.

258
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:59,708
We need to get him
to the medical ward

259
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:02,458
for more advanced healing
spells as soon as we can.

260
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:03,916
We don't have much time.

261
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,791
Ha. A one-armed squad captain.

262
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:09,083
Is there any sight more pitiful?

263
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:10,250
[laughs]

264
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,458
This is what House
Vermillion has become?

265
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:14,708
It almost makes me
ashamed to be a royal.

266
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:16,416
How could you say that?

267
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,291
The captain fought bravely.

268
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:20,250
[NOZEL]
Because we are Magic Knights.

269
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:23,416
If we do not win,
we may as well not exist.

270
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,125
Trying counts for nothing?

271
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:26,625
[SOLID]
Less than nothing!

272
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:27,958
The Crimson Lion Kings
are ruined--

273
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:29,833
[NOZEL]
Enough, Solid.

274
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:31,041
We weren't here to fight,

275
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:33,333
and that makes us
even less than him.

276
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:35,083
Now, see to the town's defenses.

277
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:38,250
This is no time for your
adolescent posturing.

278
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:40,000
Right.

279
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:41,583
There's some sort
of spell blocking

280
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:43,000
Transmission Magic.

281
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,791
The chain of command
is in chaos.

282
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:48,041
That explains why
outside reinforcements

283
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:51,375
never arrived.
Everyone stay sharp!

284
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,041
[CHARLOTTE] We need to
secure the perimeter.

285
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,916
Keep your eyes open.

286
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,958
[SOL]
You bet, Char.

287
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:57,208
Call me Captain, Sol.

288
00:14:57,291 --> 00:15:00,333
[SOL] 'Kay! Securing the
perimeter, Captain Char.

289
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:01,875
At the rate things are
going, I don't know

290
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:04,708
when I'm ever going to have
time for that dessert.

291
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,250
Quick, Klaus. Go.

292
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:08,166
Return to HQ for backup.

293
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,250
Right!

294
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,291
[NOELLE]
Asta.

295
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:29,583
Rades!

296
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,583
You put your petty need for
revenge ahead of the mission,

297
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:33,208
and this is the result.

298
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:35,583
The master may have
taken a liking to you,

299
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,166
but don't get cocky.

300
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,416
Mucking about with those
creatures of yours.

301
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,625
Taking on the
captain by yourself.

302
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:42,791
You're an arrogant fool.

303
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,416
Give it a rest already.

304
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,666
If you had stuck to the plan
like you were supposed to,

305
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,125
things would have been
much less complicated.

306
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:51,000
I don't see what you
have to complain about

307
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,250
when it was my precious puppets

308
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:53,708
that were the victims
in all of this.

309
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,583
Let's not forget
about Catherine.

310
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:58,416
Things didn't turn out
too well for her, either.

311
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,916
As if I care about that old hag.

312
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,958
Quit squabbling.

313
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:04,625
I don't know why
everyone's so upset.

314
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:06,875
You got what you wanted, right?

315
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,333
Oh, and, Sally. One thing.

316
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:11,833
This little prize of yours
can't come with us.

317
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:12,916
Kill him.

318
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,750
[SALLY]
What?! You've got to be kidding!

319
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:17,333
I can't just throw away
a prime specimen like him.

320
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:19,916
We're not talking about
simple magic-weakening spells.

321
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,750
This kid has actual Anti-Magic!

322
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:26,708
[ASTA]
Where am I? What is this stuff?

323
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:28,208
It feels sorta nice.

324
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:30,208
Only those people who
have been acknowledged

325
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:32,375
by the master may go
where we are headed.

326
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,750
We don't need more
unnecessary trouble.

327
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:37,250
Kill him before the
master comes for us.

328
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:38,375
[ASTA]
Huh?

329
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:39,583
[SALLY]
Aw!

330
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,583
You know, I'd be happy
to kill him for you.

331
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:44,041
The brat would make a good
addition to my playthings.

332
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:45,916
[ASTA]
Uh-oh. Not good.

333
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,166
[RADES]
No fair.

334
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,666
[ASTA] Looks like I've
gotten myself captured.

335
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:52,041
Oh! Goodie, goodie!
You're awake!

336
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:54,416
[ASTA]
A girl?

337
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,416
[SALLY] C'mon, you should
help me convince them!

338
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,791
It'll be great!

339
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:59,291
I'll study everything about
you and your grimoire,

340
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:02,041
and do some experiments,
and then I'll dissect you!

341
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:04,166
You want to help with
my research, don't you?

342
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,416
I'll analyze every last cell.

343
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,958
Nothing will go
to waste, I swear!

344
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:08,666
Just think of how
much we can learn!

345
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,958
[ASTA]
This girl is completely nuts!

346
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:14,125
I am in seriously deep trouble.

347
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:15,458
Crap, I can't move.

348
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:16,916
There's no getting out of here!

349
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,291
[SALLY] Are you gonna
make me beg, Geork?

350
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:21,666
Because I will. Pretty,
pretty, pretty please?

351
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,541
[GEORK sighs] Whatever you do,
just leave me out of it.

352
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:25,708
[RADES]
Give him to me!

353
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:27,125
[SALLY]
No way!

354
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:31,708
[JULIUS] Hi there.
You've kept me waiting.

355
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:34,666
[ASTA gasps]

356
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:35,958
[GEORK]
What?

357
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:36,958
[SALLY]
Ooh!

358
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:39,041
[RADES]
No, it can't be.

359
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:42,583
[GEORK] The Wizard King,
Julius Novochrono.

360
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:44,833
How did he find us?
Why is he here?

361
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:47,333
Did you have a pleasant
visit to the capital?

362
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:48,958
Kill him now!

363
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,083
[RADES, VALTOS gasp]

364
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:56,291
[GEORK, SALLY gasp]

365
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:00,000
They're gone. How did you--?

366
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:02,291
[JULIUS]
Yes, sorry about that.

367
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:05,791
It would have been too difficult
to restrain all of you.

368
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,750
Much easier for me this way.

369
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,250
[grunts]

370
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:10,666
[GEORGK yells]

371
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:14,500
[BOTH gasp]

372
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:17,416
[gasping]

373
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,708
You started this.

374
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:21,250
It was your choice
to attack the capital.

375
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,916
And now you're nervous?

376
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,125
Don't tell me you came to kill

377
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:26,875
without being prepared
to die yourselves.

378
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:30,000
[VALTOS] So strong.
But what did I expect?

379
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:32,375
He is the Wizard King.

380
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:34,708
And with my magic
power drained...

381
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:36,250
Tell you what.

382
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,333
You're skilled enough to make
this a bit of a challenge,

383
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:42,083
but I'd rather not
go to the trouble.

384
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:43,583
So, let's make a deal.

385
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:46,500
I'll let the first person
to surrender survive.

386
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:49,541
Well, do we have any
takers? Don't be shy.

387
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:50,791
[RADES growls]

388
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,583
[ALL]
Not happening.

389
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:53,833
[GEORK grunts]

390
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:57,541
[laughing]

391
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:04,708
[GEORK]
How is he moving like that?

392
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:07,166
He's so fast,
I can't even see him!

393
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,083
[gasps]

394
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:09,583
[JULIUS]
A test, then.

395
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:12,416
We'll see if it will
work on this many.

396
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,666
Time Binding Magic:

397
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,541
Chrono Stasis!

398
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:22,041
[RADES]
What... did... he... do?

399
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:23,500
[GEORK]
Body's frozen.

400
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,458
[VALTOS]
Can't move.

401
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:26,791
Well, would you look at that!

402
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:31,000
I got you all. Guess I
overestimated your skills.

403
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:32,500
I hope you enjoyed this moment

404
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:35,583
because you're going to be
stuck like that for a while.

405
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:37,708
[grunts] Ow, ow, ow.

406
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:39,666
Oh, Asta, there you are.

407
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,250
It's nice to see you again.

408
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:43,583
We keep running into each other.

409
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:45,875
Uh, yeah.

410
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:47,375
[ASTA]
That many powerful mages,

411
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:49,458
and he captured them all?

412
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:55,375
[ASTA] It shouldn't be possible,
but he pulled it off.

413
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:56,500
Amazing.

414
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:58,833
You wanna be the
Wizard King someday,

415
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:00,250
isn't that right?

416
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:01,375
[ASTA gasps]

417
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:03,291
Then I suggest you
carefully consider

418
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:05,375
everything you've seen here.

419
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:07,875
This was only the smallest
example of the sort of power

420
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:10,291
you'll have to outmatch.

421
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,000
[ASTA]
This is who I'm chasing.

422
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:14,333
The strongest man I've ever met.

423
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:16,666
The most powerful mage
in the kingdom,

424
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,791
and the one I have to surpass.

425
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:20,833
[JULIUS]
Can you stand?

426
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:22,000
[ASTA growls]

427
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:24,083
[ASTA] The Wizard King
and all his power,

428
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:26,208
right here in front of me.

429
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:35,958
[ASTA]
Idiot! Stop shaking!

430
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:37,541
Don't look weak!

431
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:41,416
[ASTA grunts, pants]

432
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:45,041
[JULIUS] Well, it would seem
you don't need help after all.

433
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:46,333
As much as I hate to admit it,

434
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:48,208
you folks have some
pretty neat magic.

435
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:51,250
It surprised me. Now, then.

436
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,875
There are a quite few questions
I'd like for you to answer.

437
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:56,625
[ASTA]
Huh?

438
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:59,125
This tablet you have
here with the jewels.

439
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:01,500
What is it for?

440
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:03,000
I've never seen
writing like this,

441
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:04,750
nor such a pattern.

442
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:07,375
What exactly were you trying
to accomplish with it?

443
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,541
[JULIUS]
Actually, hold that thought.

444
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:12,958
You can't very well answer
while caught up in my spell,

445
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:14,791
now can you?

446
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,375
We'll have a nice
chat about it later,

447
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,208
back in the Clover Kingdom.

448
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,583
[JULIUS]
Get ready. Something's coming.

449
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:26,958
So bright!

450
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,958
Where is this light coming from?

Aw, it's so adorable!

I suppose, but Nero here
is obviously much cuter.

[NERO]
Co, co!

458
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:35,750
You should try it
over rice some time.

459
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:37,125
Totally delicious!

Yum, I want a bowl!

463
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:44,333
That one is, too!

464
00:23:46,583 --> 00:23:47,833
[SALLY]
Wow!

465
00:23:47,916 --> 00:23:49,833
I can't believe the Wizard
King himself showed up!

466
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:51,458
I wonder if I could get
him to be the subject

467
00:23:51,541 --> 00:23:53,583
for my next experiment.

Just ask for Sally!
