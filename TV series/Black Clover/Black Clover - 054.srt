1
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:15,583
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:15,666 --> 00:00:18,291
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:24,333
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:26,916
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,500
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:40,041
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:43,958
[NARRATOR] The knights of
the Golden Dawn fought

8
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:47,125
to quell the Diamond Kingdom's
invasion of Kiten.

9
00:00:48,708 --> 00:00:49,833
[NARRATOR]
Meanwhile,

10
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:52,041
Yami confronted his
fellow captain Vangeance

11
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:54,416
with a long-held suspicion.

12
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,458
[YAMI]
Vangeance. If you don't mind.

13
00:00:58,541 --> 00:01:00,166
Lose the mask.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,666
[WILLIAM]
I understand, Yami.

15
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,208
You're suspicious
of me, aren't you?

16
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:10,125
You think I might be the leader
of the Eye of the Midnight Sun.

17
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:11,750
Very well.

18
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:31,041
[YAMI]
Right, well, sorry.

19
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:33,458
[NARRATOR] Asta and Yuno,
meeting again at last,

20
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:37,541
expressed a renewed conviction
to achieve their shared goal.

21
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:41,083
[BOTH] We're aiming
to become the Wizard King.

22
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:43,958
[NARRATOR] At the same time,
however, a new force

23
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:46,333
was stirring in
the Diamond Kingdom.

24
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:33,083
[ASTA screams]

25
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:36,958
Well, from the sound of it,
I've got a new patient.

26
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,416
[YAMI]
What's the deal with you, kid?

27
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,666
Are you physically incapable
of not fighting somethin'?

28
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,083
That some kinda disorder?

29
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:46,416
My body just moved
on its own, really!

30
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,750
[YAMI]
Come on.

31
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:50,333
You were beat up already,
and you fought anyway.

32
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:51,791
Here, you're gettin'
checked out.

33
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,000
That head needs lookin' at.

34
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:55,875
Well, yeah, now it does,
thanks to you!

35
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,458
Hey, come on in, Yami.

36
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,250
Brought someone to see me?

37
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:00,916
Who's that guy?

38
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,541
He's a lot less
impressive lookin'

39
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:05,625
than this fancy tower,
but don't let that fool you.

40
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:07,791
This guy's actually the
kingdom's best quack.

41
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:08,833
You're so mean!

42
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,625
He's a real powerful
recovery mage

43
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,791
who's done a pretty decent
job keeping my arms

44
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,291
attached to my body.

45
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,250
So I figured he could
take a look at yours.

46
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,375
[ASTA screams, groans]

47
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,125
That isn't helping, sir!

48
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:22,583
[laughs] Nice to meet you.

49
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:24,625
The name's Owen,
and I report directly

50
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:27,708
to the Wizard King himself.
How can I help?

51
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:29,000
Yes, sir. I'm Asta!

52
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:30,458
Nice to meet you, too!

53
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:32,708
Of course. I've heard
all about you!

54
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:34,708
Yami gets chatty
when he's drinking.

55
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:36,208
What'd he say?

56
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:38,166
Well, he's told a few
stories about how

57
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,083
your sword can nullify magic.

58
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:42,916
Who knew something like
that was even possible?

59
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,583
[ASTA] This guy reports
directly to the Wizard King?

60
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:47,041
It doesn't take a
genius to figure out

61
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:50,083
he must be seriously awesome.

62
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:53,666
[YAMI] Well, I got to see
a man about a dog, so...

63
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,583
I'm gonna win today.
I can feel it in my bones.

64
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:58,500
[OWEN]
Got some gambling to do?

65
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,000
Good luck, sir!

66
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:02,000
Y'know, that captain
of yours is an awfully

67
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:04,666
imposing man for being
so much younger than me.

68
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,166
It's kind of irritating.

69
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,500
Still, for all his growling,
he's not a bad guy.

70
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:09,333
Yeah!

71
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:11,000
Okay, go on and have a seat.

72
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:13,041
Yes, sir.

73
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,541
[OWEN]
Now, let's see here.

74
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:21,333
[gasps]

75
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:26,208
[OWEN] Water Recovery Magic:
Qualle Operation.

76
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:27,791
[OWEN]
Wow, look at that!

77
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:31,000
They got you pretty good.
But don't worry.

78
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,916
My spell sees through
the body of the person

79
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,916
it envelops, so I can zero-in
on the affected areas

80
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,125
and heal them with
extreme precision.

81
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,208
Yami's no slouch,
but you've got some pretty

82
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:43,125
amazing muscles there, yourself.

83
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:45,125
[ASTA]
Thanks! I train hard!

84
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:48,000
And now for some mana
to help with the healing.

85
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:53,458
Phew.

86
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:55,625
I thought I was never
going to get out of there.

87
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:57,875
Now that the Golden Dawn's
five jillion prisoners

88
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:00,958
have been transported,
I can track down Asta and go.

89
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:03,208
Whoa! What the heck is that?

90
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:06,208
Some kind of jellyfish
healing spell?

91
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,750
[OWEN]
Asta.

92
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:19,791
[inaudible]

93
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,291
Oh. Sorry, Finral.

94
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:41,708
Have you been waiting long?

95
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,833
It's fine, Asta,
don't worry about me.

96
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:46,208
It's not like we could go
before Yami's back, anyway.

97
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:47,416
[YAMI]
Yo.

98
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:51,541
Wow, you cleaned up.

99
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:55,500
[YAMI laughs] Yep, I knew it
was my lucky day today!

100
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,875
Um, what do you
have in the sack?

101
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:00,250
"Um, what do you
have in the sack?"

102
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,625
Less talking and more portaling,

103
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:03,833
Yes, sir.

104
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,375
[YAMI] Okay, listen up!
As some of you mighta noticed,

105
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:18,166
we've racked up
so many stars lately

106
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,500
that we've actually
made it out of the hole.

107
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:23,958
[YAMI] Which is all thanks
to you knuckleheads

108
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:26,750
and the hard work you've
been doin' so...

109
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,791
[YAMI]
That's right! It's meat time!

110
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:33,708
[BLACK BULLS gasping, cheering]

111
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:39,125
[CHARMY] Meat! This meat!
That meat! All the meat!

112
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,541
Yay, meat!

113
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:42,833
[MAGNA chuckles]

114
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,125
So yummy!

115
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:49,125
This is a freakin' holiday!

116
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,750
If Yami's treating us,
I'm gonna eat

117
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:53,625
a whole lifetime's
worth of meat!

118
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:55,666
[GAUCHE]
Marie, I would never allow you

119
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,375
to eat such inferior food.

120
00:07:58,458 --> 00:07:59,958
You wanna cook a cut
of meat like this

121
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:03,291
to between 130 and 140 degrees.

122
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:05,083
We need a high enough
temperature to make sure

123
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,791
any nasty bacteria are killed,
so it'll be safe to eat,

124
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:10,208
but not so high that
the meat gets tough.

125
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:13,958
[GAUCHE]
Say "ah."

126
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,666
Ah.

127
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:20,333
So good!

128
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,791
[gasps]

129
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:25,291
[MAGNA]

130
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,125
Hey, Magna, wanna fight to
death for this hunk of meat?

131
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:28,208
No, I don't!

132
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:30,625
Aw! You're no fun.

133
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:35,333
[laughs] Got something
to wash it down with, too.

134
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:37,333
I love today!

135
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:42,250
[GREY] Ow! Hot! Hot!
It's so hot. Ouchies!

136
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,291
[GREY]
Oh! Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!

137
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:47,833
Please don't watch me eat!
It's embarrassing!

138
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:49,208
[mumbling] You only
eat barbequed meat

139
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:50,708
with people who
are special to you.

140
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:53,750
Asta and I are special friends,
sharing the same meat.

141
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:57,416
So... I guess... it must be
hard to eat with those arms.

142
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,833
If you need
somebody to feed you,

143
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:00,875
I suppose I would
be willing to help.

144
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,000
Just this once.

145
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:05,125
Hey, look! I can eat
with my feet now!

146
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:06,333
Pretty cool, huh?

147
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:07,541
[NOELLE grumbles]

148
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:09,375
[NOELLE]
Vulgar commoner!

149
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,750
[laughs]

150
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:14,583
A'right, Finral,
show us a trick!

151
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:17,250
Oh, um, sure, right.

152
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:19,166
Watch: The Self-Punch!

153
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,791
[laughing]

154
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:23,333
All right. You're next, Charmy.

155
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:26,166
My trick: Instantly
Disappearing Meat!

156
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,458
Nom, nom, nom.

157
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:32,458
All you did was eat it.
That's cheating!

158
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:34,250
[BLACK BULLS laugh]

159
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:37,416
Let's see it, Grey. You're up!

160
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,625
Oh, no, don't make me! Please!

161
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:41,458
Shut up and do it.

162
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:46,125
Here goes: [bleep].

163
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:47,541
[GREY growls]

164
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:51,250
[YAMI laughs] Come on.
That's just your usual guy.

165
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:52,500
[BLACK BULLS laugh]

166
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:53,875
[mumbling] Wow, so much talent.

167
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,458
Everyone has such great tricks.

168
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,583
I've been practicing
one in secret myself.

169
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,000
It's really cool.
Can I show you?

170
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:03,208
Here's my trick: the
Crackling Magna Typhoon!

171
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:05,791
[CHARMY]
My turn! Meat Sheep Peacock!

172
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:07,625
[BLACK BULLS laugh]

173
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,291
[ASTA] Ooh, I can do
some weight training.

174
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,208
[MAGNA]
That's not a special trick!

175
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:13,875
[BLACK BULLS laugh]

176
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:16,791
Well, guys. I'm actually
feelin' pretty beat.

177
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:20,083
I think I'm just
gonna call it a day.

178
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:22,625
Okay. Get some shut eye, Rasta.

179
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:25,500
Great job, everybody. Night!

180
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:32,416
Does Asta seem a little
bit off to you at all?

181
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,958
You're right.

182
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:37,125
I don't know if I've ever seen
him go to bed early before.

183
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:39,125
[NOELLE]
He always seems so happy.

184
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:42,041
But it felt like he
was faking it today.

185
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:47,333
I could see if a drink
would cheer him up.

186
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:49,708
Maybe all he needs
is a good deathmatch.

187
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:53,000
Obviously, the problem is
he didn't eat enough meat.

188
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:55,916
[GREY gasps]
I wonder if something happened.

189
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,625
Ah! Forget I said anything!

190
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,125
[mumbling] Now that you
mention it, the corners

191
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:02,625
of his mouth curled up
a little less than usual

192
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:03,375
when he smiled.

193
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:05,041
Marie.

194
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,875
So, um. Listen.

195
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:11,708
[FINRAL]
I overheard something while Asta

196
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:13,375
was being healed.

197
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:17,875
[FINRAL]
His arms, they're...

198
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:20,125
They're never
going to get better.

199
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:25,708
What?

200
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:28,250
No way. That can't be right.

201
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:34,333
Asta.

202
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:37,791
I believe you were hit
with ancient Hex Magic.

203
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:42,125
On top of that, your bones
have basically disintegrated.

204
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:45,791
I'm afraid not even my magic
will be able to heal you.

205
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,958
A curse, huh?

206
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:57,041
You have my gratitude
for summoning me, human.

207
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:58,958
If the best recovery
mage in the kingdom

208
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:02,333
says that's what happened,
it's most likely true.

209
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:05,208
[gasps] It can't be.

210
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:14,250
I thought that I'd found
somebody I could fight with.

211
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,708
No! I can't believe it.

212
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:18,958
He has no magic, and now...

213
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:22,041
Now he can't even use
his only weapon anymore.

214
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:25,625
Oh, no. So sad.

215
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:28,375
[mumbling] This is awful.

216
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:30,000
Asta...

217
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,291
[OWEN]
I'm sorry to tell you this,

218
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:44,208
but you'll never
wield a sword again.

219
00:12:57,708 --> 00:13:00,541
[OWEN] You'll never
wield a sword again.

220
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:09,416
What now?

221
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:15,791
Like I'm gonna give up!

222
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,208
[ALL gasp]

223
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:20,291
[ASTA] You got me again,
Fate, you big jerk.

224
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:23,875
But all you did was get
me even more fired up!

225
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:26,083
I'm gonna find a cure
for my arms somehow,

226
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,625
do you hear me?!

227
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,666
And if that's not possible,
then I'll just figure out

228
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,000
a way to fight without them!

229
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:37,375
[panting]

230
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:39,375
These chains can measure
the magic power

231
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:41,291
of anyone they come
in contact with.

232
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:42,708
And you have none.

233
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:45,333
[ASTA] No matter how
hard I push myself.

234
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:47,791
I'll never be able to use magic.

235
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:50,041
You might as well
give it all up right now.

236
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:53,083
You were born a loser,
you worthless runt.

237
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:55,708
[ASTA]
So...

238
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,291
I might as well give u--

239
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:03,041
I almost gave up that time,
but it's never happening again.

240
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:06,416
Just you wait and see!

241
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,958
--He's fine.
--[ASTA] That settles it!

242
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,916
Yeah, kid, you tell 'em.

243
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,833
Doesn't get much
manlier than that.

244
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:14,541
Yep, that's our Asta.

245
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:15,625
Sure is.

246
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:18,041
I'll share my dessert
with him later.

247
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:21,291
After all that's happened,
he's still so hopeful.

248
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,041
[mumbling] I believed in him.

249
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,791
He is pretty tough.

250
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,916
I won't let him near Marie.

251
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,458
But I will give him that much.

252
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:32,083
[VANESSA] That's right,
kiddo. Don't you give up.

253
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:33,958
I just might know a place
where we can find

254
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,833
magic that'll help you.

255
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:49,083
Morning, everybody!

256
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:50,333
Huh?

257
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,541
[ASTA] There's always someone
around making noise

258
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:54,791
or causing trouble.

259
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:57,541
The hideout feels
totally deserted.

260
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:59,750
[ASTA] Did the others already
head out somewhere?

261
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:02,083
Beats me.

262
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:04,041
[ASTA]
Maybe they're still sleeping?

263
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:06,166
Things did get pretty
crazy yesterday.

264
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:09,916
[gasps] Hah! I can feel that ki.

265
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
If you wanna hide from me,

266
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:13,000
you'll have to do
better than that.

267
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:16,541
[ASTA]
It's Noelle and Finral.

268
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:17,958
What are they up to?

269
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:21,375
Okay, I think that's just
about everybody now.

270
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:24,000
Did you hear them all
trying to be sneaky?

271
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:26,625
"I forgot I had an
important errand to run!"

272
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:29,625
"Oh, I promised my cousin
I would visit her today."

273
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:32,000
Like it isn't totally
obvious they're running off

274
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,583
to find a cure for Asta.

275
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:34,958
Huh?

276
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:36,666
[FINRAL] I guess since they
aren't going on missions

277
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,583
they don't want Yami
to find out and get mad.

278
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:41,791
[NOELLE] Plus, you know if
Asta found out, he'd tell

279
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:44,000
everybody to focus on
their Magic Knight duties

280
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:45,791
and not worry about him.

281
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,791
[MAGNA sighs] Looks like
a place where you could

282
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:03,291
find some real trouble.

283
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,041
You gettin' scared on me, Magna?

284
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:06,458
Yeah, right!

285
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:08,916
If anything, I'm even more
excited than I was before!

286
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,666
[FINRAL] Magna and Luck
are dungeon-hunting

287
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,875
in the wastelands
of the Forsaken Realm.

288
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:15,208
[MAGNA]
Hang in there, Asta!

289
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:17,166
[FINRAL] Gauche and Gordon
are researching hexes

290
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,916
in the royal library.

291
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,708
[mumbling] I can't wait till
Asta's arms are healed up

292
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:22,125
so I can hold his hand.

293
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:24,541
Healing his wounds will only
deepen our special bond.

294
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,791
We'll be friends
forever. Total BFFs.

295
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:30,833
Hey, less creepy mumbling
and more searching.

296
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:34,708
"How to Become a Brother Loved
by His Sister: 100 Hexes"!

297
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:35,833
Marie.

298
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:43,750
All right fine, this one.

299
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:47,291
Marie would probably be sad
if I weren't able to heal him.

300
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:49,291
[mumbling] If Gauche is
thinking about somebody other

301
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,208
than his sister, I'm going
to have to get serious, too.

302
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,541
[FINRAL] Charmy and Grey
are off looking for new

303
00:16:57,625 --> 00:17:00,375
ingredients that might be
effective against curses.

304
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:02,875
Just wait, Asta. We'll bring
back delicious goodies

305
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:04,500
that will not only
cure your curse,

306
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:06,541
but will fill your tummy, too!

307
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:09,666
[gasps] I've never seen that
before, but it smells so yummy.

308
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:12,041
Maybe just a little taste.

309
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:14,625
[CHARMY] No! I have
to be strong for Asta!

310
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:15,666
Yeah!

311
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,250
Yeah!

312
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:19,791
[CROC 54A growls]

313
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:20,833
[GREY, CHARMY]
Whoa!

314
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:22,500
Cotton Creation Magic:

315
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,041
Now, Sheep Bondage!

be willing to work so hard,

You might as well
give it all up right now.

He may not have any magic,

He's the first one into

he's done so much. Asta gave
me the strength to fight.

[ASTA] For so long,
I've been frustrated.

343
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:27,625
Because I wasn't blessed
with any magic.

344

But instead, I was
blessed with friends.

[chuckles] What a
buncha numbskulls.

So that's what it takes

347
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:49,166
to actually get those
slackers workin', huh?

348
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,625
All right, Noelle,
it looks like you and I

349
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:53,000
get to work together!

350
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:54,916
Where do you think we should
start searching firs--

351
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,750
Sorry, I already know
where I'm headed,

352
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,500
and you're going
to take me there.

353
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:01,041
Then you can go search
somewhere alone.

Huh? Where do you wanna go?

There, really?
All right, your call.

356
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,916
I guess they might have some
ideas we hadn't thought of.

You know,

Vanessa didn't say
where she was going.

359

She left before
anybody else did.

360
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:21,208
Well, maybe she had a lead

361
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:23,041
and didn't wanna
waste any time.

362
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:26,041
Neither do I, for that matter,
so let's get going already.
