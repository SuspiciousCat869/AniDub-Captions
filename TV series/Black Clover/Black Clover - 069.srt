humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

After his triumph, he was hailed

00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,750
It's not like it killed ya.

[CHARLOTTE]
Oh, no, Yami's here!

164
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,458
Why is it him, of all people?

Ah! You're like,
stupid hot, Char!

[CHARLOTTE]
No.

167
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:34,375
I can't lose my composure
in front of Sol.

168
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:36,750
Calm down, Charlotte.
Don't panic.

Besides, in this outfit,
he may not even recognize me.

170
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:43,125
Huh? Princess Prickly?

173
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,375
You look like a damn doll!

174
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:50,791
[CHARLOTTE]
Deep breaths.

175
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:53,666
You mustn't let him get to you!

176
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,333
Forget my clothing.

177
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:57,041
Take a look at yours.

178
00:08:57,125 --> 00:09:00,250
[CHARLOTTE] Mostly the bottom
half. Are those undergarments?

179
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:03,375
Well! If it isn't the
shabbiest, stinkiest man

180
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:05,166
of the whole disgusting bunch!

181
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,125
The captain of the Black Bulls!

182
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:09,375
Jeez, what's she so
worked up about?

183
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,666
Think your squad might
need a talkin' to.

--Rosie?
--[SOL] Shut up!

00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,083
And keep your hairy
naked man-legs

186
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:16,875
away from our captain!

187
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:19,625
Sol. That's quite enough.

[laughs] Good,
I finally found you!

189
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,083
What are you up to, Captain?

190
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:25,875
Let's go get a drink, shall we?

Oh. Vanessa.

00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,291
[VANESSA]
Who is this woman?

194
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:38,583
And why do I suddenly feel like

195
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:41,000
I have to defeat her
at all costs?

196

[hisses]

197
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,458
You don't like the
Blue Rose captain?

[gasps]

199

[CHARLOTTE]
Who is she?

200
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:49,500
Yami seems to be rather
chummy with her.

201
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:51,541
Is she a member
of the Black Bulls?

202
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,208
I'm so jealous!

203
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:55,375
A lousy Black Bull
like you has no right

204
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:57,250
to glare at our
illustrious leader!

205
00:09:57,333 --> 00:10:00,750
What? I wasn't glaring and
I'm certainly not lousy!

206
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,500
[SOL] You and your pals wouldn't
stand a chance against her!

207
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,625
Never in a million,
billion years!

208
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,625
[laughs]

209
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:10,166
Hey, nice insult. Real original.

210
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:13,166
[VANESSA] I can't take
this kind of harassment

211
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,375
from a Blue Rose! That's it.

212
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:18,708
I need to find a way to
defend the captain's honor!

213
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:21,708
Enough chit-chat!
Time for us to duel!

214
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:25,083
[CROWD cheers]

215
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,458
That's absurd.

216
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:28,625
The ceremony is
about to begin, Sol.

217
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:29,833
Stay focused.

218
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:31,000
Say what?!

219
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:33,125
Char's gonna destroy
you for sure!

220
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:34,750
We accept your challenge!

221
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,875
Good luck, you two!

222
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,583
So, what'll it be then?
I should say,

223
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:52,875
I'm stronger now than
I've ever been before,

224
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:54,541
so I won't go down easily.

[meows]

226
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,458
You fool.

227
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:58,833
If you knew me,
you would realize

228
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:00,666
how preposterous you sound.

229
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,333
I am the captain of
the Blue Rose Knights.

230
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:04,625
Uh, Captain?

231
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,541
This is about to get really bad!

232
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,208
Shouldn't we stop 'em?

233
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:09,708
No.

234
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:12,125
[FINRAL] Now, now, ladies,
if I could just interject here.

235
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:14,666
We're at a festival,
so let's settle this amicably--

236
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,666
Of course a man would say that!

237
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,333
The only thing you could win
is a flirting contest!

238
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:21,041
[FINRAL]
Ouch.

239
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:23,416
In that case, let me
offer you a suggestion!

240
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,250
The perfect battle
for two beauties

241
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:28,708
on such a festive evening:
a dress up showdown!

[CROWD cheers]

243
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:32,458
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:33,833
What's wrong?

245
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:35,833
Are you scared
you're gonna lose?

246
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:37,416
Of course she's not!

247
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,416
You could put Char in a burlap
sack and she'd still rock it!

It sounds like they're
all having a good time.

251
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:52,041
Well, good for them.

252
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:55,375
They don't appear to be causing
any trouble, so it's fine.

253
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:57,500
Let's make our way
to the ceremony.

254
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,000
We mustn't be late.

255
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:00,250
I agree.

256
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:03,250
It's a big night,
so I'm a little nervous!

257
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,541
There's no need for
us to be nervous.

258
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,625
We're sure to take the top spot.

259
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:08,666
Right.

260
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,916
But the Black Bulls
have been doing

261
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,958
such a great job lately,
I'm kind of worried

262
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,875
they'll surprise us.

263
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:16,625
Indeed, they may
have improved a bit.

264
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:18,458
No, they definitely have.

265
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:22,291
Asta in particular has done
incredible things this year.

It can't be, that's impossible!

267
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:26,458
They are the Black
Bulls, after all!

268
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:28,666
They've always been
clowns and ruffians!

269
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,791
The Golden Dawn need not
concern ourselves with them!

270

Right, Yuno?

271
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:35,000
You're asking if I
think we'll be outdone

272
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:37,791
by the Black Bulls,
the lowest of the low?

273
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:38,916
Not a chance.

I knew if we copied
that loser's outfit,

it would be obvious
how much more elegant

The choice is crystal clear!

Ha, naturally.

I could never lose
to a weakling like her.

Agh, I hate this!

Although, since he's here,
he might as well look.

If I resemble that woman
