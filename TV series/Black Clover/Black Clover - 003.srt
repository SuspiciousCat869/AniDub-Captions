00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:02,208
I've come for you,
just as I promised I would.

325
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:05,125
I am the Wizard King now.
Hop on, my dear.

326
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:07,083
Yes!

327
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:09,916
Hold on tight for
the ride of your life.

328
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:14,750
It'll be great!

329
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:17,333
[YUNO] Can you even fly
a broom? Without any magic?

330
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:19,083
[yelps]

331
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:20,333
Yeah, sure, I'll make it work.

332
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:21,708
Will you, now?

333
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:24,750
Totally! I'm sure my trusty
grimoire will help me.

334
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:27,541
As long as you don't give up,
you can do anything.

335
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:28,958
C'mon, let's move!

336
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,875
Do you wanna get left behind?

337
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:33,708
We'll keep training till
we reach the capital!

338
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:35,708
[YUNO]
Sure, we will.

339
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:38,208
Betcha can't catch me! Ha, ha!

340

[YUNO, ASTA panting]

341
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,125
No, not done yet!

[ASTA, YUNO panting]

344
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,958
[YUNO] Stop this.
So much further to go.

345
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:58,666
Not yet. Still going.

346
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,208
[sighs]

347
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,375
Ow, ow, ow, ow,
ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:14,875
[ASTA yells]

349
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:21,166
I wish everybody back home
could get to try this, too.

350
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,208
Yeah.

351
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,625
This way!

352
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,500
Actually, this way.

353
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:34,750
Hey, wait up.

354
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,083
[BOTH gasp]

355
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,000
Stay out of my way!

356
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:55,125
Calm down. I was
just helping you.

357
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:57,291
Well, I don't need your help.

358
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:01,125
Gotcha!

359
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:18,500
[coughs]

360
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:21,958
No! My precious
moguro-leaf juice.

361
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:43,000
Why'd you stop?

362
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:44,166
[gasps]

363
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:51,791
Oh, wow! It's huge.

364
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,916
The capital! Finally!

365
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,458
[ASTA]
That's where the Wizard King is!

366
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:04,708
Here we go. Time to
do this thing!

367
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:08,458
Hope you're ready!
'Cause I'm comin'!

368
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:12,708
I will be the Wizard King! Yeah!

369
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:16,458
[NARRATOR] After a long
journey, Asta and Yuno

370
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,625
have finally arrived
at the royal capital

371
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:20,375
of the Clover Kingdom.

372
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:21,416
Awaiting them there

373
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,791
is the Magic Knights
Entrance Exam.

374
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:28,333
If they are to join
a Magic Knight squad,

375
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:32,333
they must face off against
one mighty foe after another.

"The Mystery of the Grimoires."

378
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:19,333
[gasps] What happened?
I think... we've shrunk.

379
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:21,125
Anyway, like I was saying.

380
00:23:21,208 --> 00:23:23,750
My grimoire and yours
are totally different.

381
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:26,791
[YUNO]
Okay...

382
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:28,291
[YUNO]
A grimoire's measurements.

383
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:30,875
It's size, thickness,
etcetera, are determined

384
00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:32,333
based on its owner's talent.

385
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:34,208
All right then,
let's compare grimoires.

386
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:35,833
Come on, hand it over.

387
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:36,625
No way.

388
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:37,791
[ASTA]
Why not?

389
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,333
You're afraid you'll
lose, aren't you?

390
00:23:39,416 --> 00:23:40,250
[YUNO]
Not a chance.

391
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:41,750
[ASTA]
Hey!

392
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:43,833
Don't get so cocky just 'cause
the girls kinda like you.

393
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:44,708
[YUNO]
Let it go.

394

C'mon, Yuno.

396
00:23:47,916 --> 00:23:49,916
We've always wanted
to be Magic Knights!

397
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,583
This is the first
step on the road

398
00:23:51,666 --> 00:23:53,416
to becoming the Wizard King!
