[NARRATOR]
The Clover Kingdom.

2
00:00:24,222 --> 00:00:26,599
In this place where
magic is everything,

3
00:00:26,683 --> 00:00:29,561
there lives one boy
who was born without it.

4
00:00:29,644 --> 00:00:32,022
His name is Asta.

5
00:00:33,398 --> 00:00:34,816
[NARRATOR]
His strength and determination

6
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:37,152
helped him become
a Magic Knight.

7
00:00:37,235 --> 00:00:39,821
And despite the many
challenges he faces,

8
00:00:39,904 --> 00:00:43,575
he aims for the top
and refuses to give up!

9
00:00:43,658 --> 00:00:45,285
Rich or poor,

10
00:00:45,368 --> 00:00:47,370
royalty or commoner,

11
00:00:47,454 --> 00:00:50,331
Asta believes anyone can shine.

12
00:00:50,415 --> 00:00:53,376
His mission is to prove
that to the whole world

13
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,338
and to become the
next Wizard King!

[NARRATOR]
The Clover Kingdom.

15
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:34,019
Much of the royal capital was
decimated during an attack

16
00:02:34,102 --> 00:02:36,104
by the Eye of the Midnight Sun,

17
00:02:36,187 --> 00:02:38,982
but repairs are
running smoothly.

18
00:02:39,065 --> 00:02:40,817
As proof that
this ruthless enemy

19
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,445
is no longer a threat,
the residents have gathered

20
00:02:43,528 --> 00:02:46,239
in the square, knowing that
the stalwart individuals

21
00:02:46,322 --> 00:02:48,658
who watch over their nation
are working tirelessly

22
00:02:48,742 --> 00:02:51,995
to restore peace and normalcy
as soon as possible.

23

[MAN 130A]
Captain Vangeance!

24
00:02:53,371 --> 00:02:55,790
[GIRL 130A]
That's him! [squeals]

25
00:02:55,874 --> 00:02:57,917
He's the hero who saved us all!

26
00:02:58,001 --> 00:03:00,545
[MAN 130B]
The captains are so great!

[GIRL 130B]
Lord Fuegoleon!

28
00:03:02,339 --> 00:03:04,215
[GIRL 130C]
Not only is he captain again,

29
00:03:04,299 --> 00:03:06,301
but he controls
Salamander now, too!

30
00:03:06,384 --> 00:03:08,261
[GIRL 130D]
And there's Lord Nozel.

31
00:03:08,345 --> 00:03:09,596
His bangs are dreamy!

32
00:03:09,679 --> 00:03:11,264
[MAN 130C] I heard that
he was on the front lines

33
00:03:11,348 --> 00:03:13,099
during that last battle!

34

[MAN 130D]
Lady Charlotte!

35

[MAN 130E] They say every
rose has its thorns...

36
00:03:16,978 --> 00:03:17,979
[CHARLOTTE]
I don't see Yami

37
00:03:18,063 --> 00:03:20,732
or the Green Praying
Mantis Captain.

38
00:03:20,815 --> 00:03:24,652
How dare they be late on an
important occasion such as this?

39
00:03:24,736 --> 00:03:26,446
[GIRL 130E]
There's Rill!

40
00:03:26,529 --> 00:03:28,239
[MAN 130F]
Uh, is he okay?

41
00:03:28,323 --> 00:03:29,991
Looks like he's
spacing out there.

42
00:03:30,075 --> 00:03:31,659
[MAN 130G]
Oh, yeah, I know that face.

43
00:03:31,743 --> 00:03:34,079
He's definitely in love.

44
00:03:34,162 --> 00:03:36,164
[RILL]
That wonderful girl.

45
00:03:36,247 --> 00:03:38,708
I wonder where she is now.

46
00:03:38,792 --> 00:03:41,044
[WALTER]
Master Rill's first love!

47
00:03:41,127 --> 00:03:42,420
Great news, Madam!

48
00:03:42,504 --> 00:03:45,423
Your precious little boy
is starting to become a man!

49
00:03:45,507 --> 00:03:47,467
I'd say it's only
a matter of time

50
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,427
before you'll be a grandmother!

51
00:03:49,511 --> 00:03:51,596
[MAN 130H]
Wow, look, it's Lady Dorothy!

52
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,889
[GIRL 130F]
She's awake!

53
00:03:52,972 --> 00:03:55,100
Who knew she had
such pretty eyes?

54
00:03:55,183 --> 00:03:57,352
Hey there! How is everybody?

55
00:03:57,435 --> 00:03:59,938
[MAN 130I] Lord Kaiser looks
awfully dapper today!

56
00:04:00,021 --> 00:04:02,232
[MAN 130J] Yeah, but he
seems a little down.

57
00:04:02,315 --> 00:04:03,650
[sighs]

58
00:04:03,733 --> 00:04:06,027
[GIRL 130G] Check it out!

60
00:04:12,951 --> 00:04:15,328
[GIRL 130I]
Oh, no, is he injured?

61
00:04:15,412 --> 00:04:17,372
[MAN 130K] I guess so,
I heard he was the one

62
00:04:17,455 --> 00:04:18,957
who stopped the
Eye of the Midnight Sun

63
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,292
back when they attacked
the royal capital.

64
00:04:21,376 --> 00:04:22,669
[GIRL 130I] Goodness,
he must've been through

65
00:04:22,752 --> 00:04:25,338
such a terrible ordeal
to protect all of us.

66
00:04:25,422 --> 00:04:27,841
I hope he isn't
in too much pain.

67
00:04:27,924 --> 00:04:30,051
[MAN 130K]
We'll never forget what he did!

68
00:04:30,135 --> 00:04:32,971
Go, Wizard King!

69
00:04:33,054 --> 00:04:33,888
[OWEN]
What?

70
00:04:33,972 --> 00:04:35,515
You want me to pose as you?

71
00:04:35,598 --> 00:04:36,933
That's ridiculous!

72
00:04:37,017 --> 00:04:38,685
Perhaps, but I can't exactly

73
00:04:38,768 --> 00:04:41,354
go marching into the capital
looking like a child.

74
00:04:41,438 --> 00:04:44,107
There'd be trouble if
the king saw me this way.

75
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:48,236
And, of course, not appearing
at all would be suspicious.

76
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:51,031
True, but don't you think
they'll know the difference?

77
00:04:51,114 --> 00:04:52,991
I've already thought
through the whole thing.

78
00:04:53,074 --> 00:04:56,161
All you have to do is
stand up there and wave.

79
00:04:56,244 --> 00:04:57,704
Here. Cover your
face with these.

80
00:04:57,787 --> 00:04:59,122
Wha--?

81
00:04:59,205 --> 00:05:00,915
[OWEN] Your appearance is
different now, but inside,

82
00:05:00,999 --> 00:05:02,167
you're the same
as you ever were.

83
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,627
Just smile and wave and
pray they don't notice.

84
00:05:07,589 --> 00:05:10,425
[WILLIAM clears throat]
We're sorry. The Wizard King

85
00:05:10,508 --> 00:05:12,594
has a sore throat
today, so, sadly,

86
00:05:12,677 --> 00:05:14,679
he won't be able
to speak to you all.

87
00:05:14,763 --> 00:05:16,222
Please excuse him.

88
00:05:16,306 --> 00:05:18,767
[GIRL 130K] Aw, I was looking
forward to hearing from him.

89
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,101
[MAN 130M]
Well, these things happen.

90
00:05:20,185 --> 00:05:21,644
[GIRL 130L]
Yeah.

91
00:05:21,728 --> 00:05:23,980
[WILLIAM] Now. I'd like everyone
to give a round of applause

92
00:05:24,064 --> 00:05:26,775
to the valiant hero who
stood up to our enemies

93
00:05:26,858 --> 00:05:28,902
and protected our
beloved kingdom.

94
00:05:28,985 --> 00:05:31,112
Our illustrious ruler.

Oh, hey, he's here, too.

97
00:05:37,202 --> 00:05:39,829
[MAN 130N]
He's okay, I guess.

00:05:39,913 --> 00:05:42,123
[GIRL 130N murmurs]
Thanks for your help.

99
00:05:42,207 --> 00:05:44,084
Why are you
dawdling back there?

100
00:05:44,167 --> 00:05:45,710
Pick up the pace, knave!

101
00:05:45,794 --> 00:05:48,046
This is my one moment
of glory, you know!

102
00:05:48,129 --> 00:05:50,173
So- <i>hah-</i> ry!

103
00:05:50,256 --> 00:05:51,424
[SEKKE]
How the heck did I end up

104
00:05:51,508 --> 00:05:53,093
being errand boy to this king?

105
00:05:53,176 --> 00:05:55,970
It turns out, going with
the flow is for chumps!

106
00:05:56,054 --> 00:05:59,099
How dare you stand
in my royal bubble?

107
00:05:59,182 --> 00:06:01,976
Same goes for you!

108
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,186
[KING CLOVER]
Curse you, Julius!

109
00:06:03,269 --> 00:06:05,438
Now I'm responsible for
addressing the people,

110
00:06:05,522 --> 00:06:09,442
all because you have a little
tickle in your pathetic throat?

111
00:06:09,526 --> 00:06:12,028
Then again, this might be
the perfect opportunity

112
00:06:12,112 --> 00:06:15,073
to demonstrate my superior
dignity and benevolence.

113
00:06:15,156 --> 00:06:16,449
You poor fool.

114
00:06:16,533 --> 00:06:20,078
I hope you enjoyed the
attention while it lasted!

115
00:06:20,161 --> 00:06:22,914
[KING CLOVER]
A-hem! Greetings and salutations

116

to all my loyal subjects!

117
00:06:24,499 --> 00:06:26,876
Your king, Augustus Kira
Clover the Thirteenth,

118
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,337
is gracing you
with his presence!

119
00:06:29,421 --> 00:06:32,507
[KING CLOVER] Erm. What's this?
They're at a loss for words!

120
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:35,719
They must be stunned
by my immaculate visage!

121
00:06:35,802 --> 00:06:37,387
[CITIZEN 130A]
Is he almost done, or...?

122
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:38,346
[CITIZEN 130AA]
Shh!

123
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,806
[WILLIAM]
Yes. As you can see,

124
00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:41,558
the public awaits
your kingly wisdom

125
00:06:41,641 --> 00:06:43,351
with bated breath, Majesty.

126
00:06:43,435 --> 00:06:45,353
But please make it
as brief as possible,

127
00:06:45,437 --> 00:06:46,938
lest the suspense kill them.

128
00:06:47,022 --> 00:06:48,940
Er, of course.

129
00:06:49,024 --> 00:06:50,900
[KING CLOVER]
Hmph! I beg your pardon!

130
00:06:50,984 --> 00:06:53,695
The king takes
orders from no one!

131
00:06:53,778 --> 00:06:56,406
[KING CLOVER]
A-hem! Thanks to my brave deeds,

132
00:06:56,489 --> 00:06:58,616
with minimal assistance
from the Magic Knights,

133
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,077
the Eye of the
Midnight Sun has fled,

134
00:07:01,161 --> 00:07:03,830
and peace has finally been
restored to the Clover Kingdom.

135
00:07:03,913 --> 00:07:05,498
You're so welcome!

136
00:07:05,582 --> 00:07:07,042
None of this would've
been possible

137
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:10,128
without the impressive things
I do on a daily basis!

138
00:07:10,211 --> 00:07:12,922
However, I imagine some
of you are still concerned!

139
00:07:13,006 --> 00:07:15,467
How will your lives change?

140
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:18,219
What if another enemy
tries to attack us?

141
00:07:18,303 --> 00:07:21,264
But I promise, there's
no need for that!

142
00:07:21,348 --> 00:07:24,267
Hark! Witness my
splendid Light Magic!

And so, my adoring public!

As long as the Clover Kingdom
remains in my capable hands,

it shall always be safe!

doubts upon my shoulders!

Damnit. That's enough, beanpole.

once and for all!

have to ask me twice.

your mouth is, foreigner!

157
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:05,141
Hey, wait. What's going on?

158
00:08:05,225 --> 00:08:07,018
What is this, a party?

159
00:08:07,102 --> 00:08:10,897
Yami, Jack. I know
I told you two.

160
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,400
We had an important
event planned today.

161
00:08:13,483 --> 00:08:15,151
We were supposed to
gather in the square

162
00:08:15,235 --> 00:08:17,696
and tell everyone that
the enemy's been defeated.

163
00:08:17,779 --> 00:08:19,072
Oh, was that today?

164
00:08:19,155 --> 00:08:21,324
[cackles] Must've
slipped my mind.

165
00:08:21,408 --> 00:08:22,742
Picking unnecessary fights

166
00:08:22,826 --> 00:08:25,286
is not an acceptable
reason to show up late.

167
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,330
Trust me, he's the
one who started it.

168
00:08:27,414 --> 00:08:28,707
That's a lie!

169
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:31,042
We were both there, you know
damn well what happened!

170
00:08:31,126 --> 00:08:33,211
I think we've heard enough
from the two of you.

171
00:08:33,294 --> 00:08:35,964
This is hardly
the time or place.

172
00:08:36,047 --> 00:08:37,966
[YAMI, JACK]
Tch.

173
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:41,094
[CITIZEN 130B] Goodness, both
of those squads are so violent!

174
00:08:41,177 --> 00:08:42,929
[CITIZEN 130BB]
You saw the paper, right?

175
00:08:43,013 --> 00:08:45,890
They say one of the Black Bulls
is possessed by a devil!

176
00:08:45,974 --> 00:08:47,142
[CITIZEN 130B]
That makes sense.

177
00:08:47,225 --> 00:08:48,893
When they placed second
at the Star Festival,

178
00:08:48,977 --> 00:08:50,895
I knew they must've
had outside help.

179
00:08:50,979 --> 00:08:53,023
[CITIZEN 130BB]
Exactly! Everyone knows

180
00:08:53,106 --> 00:08:54,107
they're the worst squad.

181
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:56,484
Why, you irreverent ingrates!

182
00:08:56,568 --> 00:08:59,821
How dare you intrude upon my
invincible Light Magic spell?

183
00:08:59,904 --> 00:09:00,697
[YAMI]
Huh?

184
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:01,740
Your what?

185
00:09:01,823 --> 00:09:03,241
Don't test me!

186
00:09:03,324 --> 00:09:05,869
You brutes stepped
right into my spotlight!

187
00:09:05,952 --> 00:09:07,412
Your Highness.

188
00:09:07,495 --> 00:09:10,415
Perhaps this is a chance to
show the people your leniency.

189
00:09:10,498 --> 00:09:13,376
If they see how merciful
you are, they'll like you more.

190
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,378
Ah, is that so?

191
00:09:15,462 --> 00:09:16,671
[KING CLOVER]
Who wants your opinion?

192
00:09:16,755 --> 00:09:18,715
Just because you've
been hailed as a hero.

193
00:09:18,798 --> 00:09:21,009
Give me a break!

194
00:09:21,092 --> 00:09:22,177
[KING CLOVER]
Er, I mean...

195
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,970
I must applaud your fervor!

196
00:09:24,054 --> 00:09:26,890
By all means, gentlemen,
keep being your raucous selves!

197
00:09:26,973 --> 00:09:29,934
It's a symbol of your
passion for our great land!

198
00:09:30,018 --> 00:09:31,144
[JACK, YAMI]
Sure.

199
00:09:31,227 --> 00:09:33,646
And now, His Majesty
will take his leave.

200
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:35,357
Let's give him one more
round of applause.

201
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,400
[applause]

202
00:09:37,484 --> 00:09:40,111
Um. Excuse me, Captain Jack?

203
00:09:40,195 --> 00:09:41,738
Look, anytime you
want me to come back

204
00:09:41,821 --> 00:09:43,948
to the Praying Mantises,
just give me a ha- <i>hah-</i> ller!

205
00:09:44,032 --> 00:09:46,284
"Come back"?
Who the hell are you?

206
00:09:46,368 --> 00:09:47,994
[SEKKE]
Ha, ha?!

207
00:09:48,078 --> 00:09:50,038
Attend to me, servant boy!

208
00:09:50,121 --> 00:09:52,082
Uh, be right there!

209
00:09:52,165 --> 00:09:53,625
Is he one of your guys?

210
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:57,045
You really think I'd let
a wuss like that on my squad?

211
00:09:57,128 --> 00:09:59,798
[WILLIAM sighs]
I suppose it's about time

212
00:09:59,881 --> 00:10:01,299
for us to head out, as well.

213
00:10:01,383 --> 00:10:02,425
Yeah, I guess.

214
00:10:02,509 --> 00:10:04,803
'Kay, later!

215
00:10:04,886 --> 00:10:07,013
[GIRL 130O]
Lord Vangeance!

216
00:10:07,097 --> 00:10:09,307
[OWEN]
Thank goodness it's over.

217
00:10:09,391 --> 00:10:11,601
[YAMI] You gonna explain
your outfit, doc?

218
00:10:11,685 --> 00:10:13,144
Or do we have to guess?

219
00:10:13,228 --> 00:10:14,229
[OWEN]
What?

220
00:10:31,162 --> 00:10:33,540
[FINRAL] Yikes. All of
the Magic Knight Captains

221
00:10:33,623 --> 00:10:35,125
in the same room.

222
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:37,544
Kind of hard not to feel like
we're under a lot of pressure.

223
00:10:37,627 --> 00:10:39,170
Yeah, if this is
supposed to be a meeting

224
00:10:39,254 --> 00:10:41,006
for captains, then I
wonder why they wanted

225
00:10:41,089 --> 00:10:43,091
all of us to be a part of it.

226
00:10:44,592 --> 00:10:46,344
I should apologize, Yami.

227
00:10:46,428 --> 00:10:49,431
You and the Black Bulls are the
ones who deserve that praise,

228
00:10:49,514 --> 00:10:51,891
and yet the audience
mostly cheered for me.

229
00:10:51,975 --> 00:10:54,644
We're kinda used to
gettin' booed, actually.

230
00:10:54,728 --> 00:10:56,104
Right, I'm sorry.

231
00:10:56,187 --> 00:10:59,190
Yeah, yeah, whatever.
Just forget about it.

232
00:10:59,274 --> 00:11:00,442
[CHARLOTTE]
Calm down.

233
00:11:00,525 --> 00:11:02,110
Don't let your
heart go aflutter.

234
00:11:02,193 --> 00:11:05,321
Just relax and breathe.

235
00:11:05,405 --> 00:11:07,240
What's wrong, Prickly Princess?

236
00:11:07,323 --> 00:11:09,826
Your face is all red.
Feelin' okay?

237
00:11:09,909 --> 00:11:12,203
I'm perfectly all right!

238
00:11:12,287 --> 00:11:13,371
[YAMI]
Listen.

239
00:11:13,455 --> 00:11:14,831
[gasps]

240
00:11:14,914 --> 00:11:15,957
If you need to take a dump,

241
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:18,084
it's not healthy
to hold it in, just go!

242
00:11:18,168 --> 00:11:19,919
That's not the issue at all!

243
00:11:20,003 --> 00:11:22,339
How can a person be
so utterly devoid of tact?

244
00:11:22,422 --> 00:11:23,757
So I was wrong?

245
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,008
Dead wrong!

246
00:11:25,091 --> 00:11:27,469
[JACK] You really don't
get it, do you, Yami?

247
00:11:27,552 --> 00:11:31,598
No wonder everyone's calling
you a clueless idiot.

248
00:11:31,681 --> 00:11:33,141
She needs to piss.

249
00:11:33,224 --> 00:11:34,476
No!

250
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:35,810
[NOELLE]
And they're in charge.

251
00:11:35,894 --> 00:11:38,104
[MIMOSA]
Are they like that all the time?

252
00:11:38,188 --> 00:11:41,191
[FINRAL]
I wish this was shocking to me.

253
00:11:41,274 --> 00:11:42,609
Forcing us to come to a meeting

254
00:11:42,692 --> 00:11:44,361
and then being the
last person to show up.

255
00:11:44,444 --> 00:11:47,364
If that's not typical Julius,
I don't know what is.

256
00:11:47,447 --> 00:11:49,949
I bet you anything
he forgot about all this.

257
00:11:50,033 --> 00:11:53,286
He's probably off goofin' around
somewhere like a little idiot.

258
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:54,621
Crazy old man.

259
00:11:54,704 --> 00:11:56,623
Or crazy old kid, I guess.

260
00:11:56,706 --> 00:11:59,209
I hate to say it,
but you're right.

261
00:11:59,292 --> 00:12:00,335
[NOZEL]
Shameful.

262
00:12:00,418 --> 00:12:02,921
Yeah, that's true!
He's so silly!

263
00:12:03,004 --> 00:12:04,631
[CAPTAINS]
Agreed.

264
00:12:05,924 --> 00:12:07,926
Any idea what his problem is?

265
00:12:08,009 --> 00:12:09,469
Nope!

266
00:12:09,552 --> 00:12:12,430
He's been stuck like that since
the curse broke, apparently.

267
00:12:14,516 --> 00:12:17,519
[MARX] I'm sorry for
the wait, everyone.

268
00:12:17,602 --> 00:12:19,646
Excellent. I see
you all made it.

269
00:12:19,729 --> 00:12:21,106
[gasps]

270
00:12:21,189 --> 00:12:22,399
[NOELLE]
Him again!

271
00:12:22,482 --> 00:12:23,900
[MIMOSA]
Damnatio.

272
00:12:23,983 --> 00:12:25,860
They asked him to come, too?

273
00:12:25,944 --> 00:12:27,946
Pardon the delay.

274
00:12:28,029 --> 00:12:29,614
Careful.

275
00:12:29,698 --> 00:12:31,991
If you try to condemn one
of my squad members again,

276
00:12:32,075 --> 00:12:33,118
I swear I will--

277
00:12:33,201 --> 00:12:34,202
Yami.

278
00:12:34,285 --> 00:12:35,620
I'm the one who
summoned him here,

279
00:12:35,704 --> 00:12:37,288
so there's no need to fight.

280
00:12:37,372 --> 00:12:39,332
Wait, you were invited?

281
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:40,709
So it would seem.

282
00:12:40,792 --> 00:12:43,586
Apparently, the topic
in question involves me.

283
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:46,548
I was informed that my
presence was required.

284
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:49,634
Our meeting today

285
00:12:49,718 --> 00:12:53,304
is about the devil residing
in the Spade Kingdom.

286
00:12:53,388 --> 00:12:55,473
Recently, some of our
Magic Knights paid a visit

287
00:12:55,557 --> 00:12:57,100
to the Heart Kingdom
hoping to gather

288
00:12:57,183 --> 00:13:00,145
information about the devils.

289
00:13:00,228 --> 00:13:02,814
I trust everyone's seen
the reports by now.

290
00:13:02,897 --> 00:13:05,233
However, since you
all were there,

291
00:13:05,316 --> 00:13:07,610
we would like
to hear it from you.

292
00:13:07,694 --> 00:13:08,737
Please proceed.

293
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,738
Okay!

294
00:13:09,821 --> 00:13:12,323
We'll do our best, sir.

295
00:13:12,407 --> 00:13:14,492
[MIMOSA] In the Heart Kingdom,
the strength of a mage

296
00:13:14,576 --> 00:13:18,413
is normally determined by
a system called magic stages.

297
00:13:18,496 --> 00:13:20,874
[NOELLE] The ranking starts
at nine, then eight, seven,

298
00:13:20,957 --> 00:13:22,208
and so on.

299
00:13:22,292 --> 00:13:25,587
And the smaller the number,
the stronger the mage.

300
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:28,173
[FINRAL] According to Queen
Loropechika, it's extremely rare

301
00:13:28,256 --> 00:13:30,967
and favorable to have
mages at stage zero.

302
00:13:31,051 --> 00:13:33,511
So, whenever there's a battle,
the side with the most warriors

303
00:13:33,595 --> 00:13:36,139
at that level is considered
the superior one.

304
00:13:36,222 --> 00:13:37,640
And this is the
most important part

305
00:13:37,724 --> 00:13:39,059
of what we've learned.

306
00:13:39,142 --> 00:13:41,394
If we go up against a devil,
we won't stand a chance

307
00:13:41,478 --> 00:13:44,022
unless everyone is
at least a stage one.

308
00:13:44,105 --> 00:13:45,899
A stage one, eh?

309
00:13:45,982 --> 00:13:47,108
Right.

310
00:13:48,234 --> 00:13:50,737
Asta and his companions
traveled to the Heart Kingdom

311
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,656
to investigate a curse
that was cast by a devil.

312
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:56,910
We found that the victim
was the queen herself.

313
00:13:56,993 --> 00:14:00,080
Apparently, she only
has a year left to live.

314
00:14:00,163 --> 00:14:02,374
And the devil who
cursed her was...

315
00:14:02,457 --> 00:14:04,250
...Megicula, yes.

316
00:14:04,334 --> 00:14:05,710
[NOELLE gasps]

317
00:14:05,794 --> 00:14:08,672
[MARX] Some of the other
Black Bulls also made a report.

318
00:14:08,755 --> 00:14:11,216
It seems the Diamond Kingdom
is currently under attack

319
00:14:11,299 --> 00:14:12,926
by the Spade Kingdom.

320
00:14:13,009 --> 00:14:16,888
Over the past few years, Spade
has steadily become stronger.

321
00:14:16,971 --> 00:14:18,390
It's likely...

322
00:14:18,473 --> 00:14:20,058
...that they could
be receiving assistance

323
00:14:20,141 --> 00:14:23,395
from the very devil
we're discussing, right?

324
00:14:23,478 --> 00:14:24,854
So, to sum everything up,

325
00:14:24,938 --> 00:14:27,273
I've called this meeting so
we can decide the best way

326
00:14:27,357 --> 00:14:30,360
to provide aid to
the Heart Kingdom.

327
00:14:30,443 --> 00:14:32,779
Queen Loropetchka plans
to invade the Spade Kingdom

328
00:14:32,862 --> 00:14:36,282
in six months' time,
before she becomes too weak.

329
00:14:36,366 --> 00:14:38,410
We're considering
deploying our own forces

330
00:14:38,493 --> 00:14:40,370
to fight alongside them.

331
00:14:40,453 --> 00:14:43,039
I'm asking each one of you
to make your squads

332
00:14:43,123 --> 00:14:45,625
are as strong as you can.

333
00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:47,210
We only have six months,

334
00:14:47,293 --> 00:14:48,837
but please do
everything possible

335
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,922
to raise their stages to one.

336
00:14:51,006 --> 00:14:54,509
We must defeat Spade to protect
the residents of Heart,

337
00:14:54,592 --> 00:14:57,303
as well as our own land.

338
00:14:57,387 --> 00:14:59,389
I've been informed
by Queen Loropetchka

339
00:14:59,472 --> 00:15:03,435
that the Spirit Guardians
are also going to contribute.

340
00:15:03,518 --> 00:15:05,061
Can I count on you?

341
00:15:05,145 --> 00:15:06,438
Yes, Wizard King.

342
00:15:06,521 --> 00:15:07,272
Of course.

343
00:15:07,355 --> 00:15:09,190
As if you needed to ask me.

344
00:15:09,274 --> 00:15:11,234
My team has already started.

345
00:15:11,317 --> 00:15:13,069
I told the Black Bulls
they could do things

346
00:15:13,153 --> 00:15:16,031
however they see fit
over the next half a year.

347
00:15:17,741 --> 00:15:19,492
Yes, William?

348
00:15:19,576 --> 00:15:21,578
I'll participate in the battle.

349
00:15:21,661 --> 00:15:22,871
However, as you all know,

350
00:15:22,954 --> 00:15:25,248
the things I did in the
past were unforgivable,

351
00:15:25,331 --> 00:15:26,958
and I believe I am
no longer worthy

352
00:15:27,042 --> 00:15:29,169
of facing my squad as Captain.

353
00:15:29,252 --> 00:15:30,503
And so, with a heavy heart,

354
00:15:30,587 --> 00:15:32,881
I request that you
relieve me of my position.

355
00:15:32,964 --> 00:15:34,382
--[ASTA] Huh?
--[MIMOSA gasps]

356
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:36,051
Wait--

357
00:15:36,134 --> 00:15:37,218
If you would, sir,

358
00:15:37,302 --> 00:15:39,387
I'd like you to assign
me a new mission.

359
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:41,473
It would be an honor
to put my life on the line

360
00:15:41,556 --> 00:15:43,433
to help overthrow this devil.

361
00:15:43,516 --> 00:15:45,518
Captain Vangeance.

362
00:15:45,602 --> 00:15:47,937
If he's to blame
in this, then so am I.

363
00:15:48,021 --> 00:15:50,690
Although my body was possessed
by an elf at the time.

364
00:15:50,774 --> 00:15:53,234
I have committed
unspeakable crimes.

365
00:15:53,318 --> 00:15:56,863
I should be put to death.

366
00:15:56,946 --> 00:15:58,198
I failed as well.

367
00:15:58,281 --> 00:16:01,034
It isn't right to
call myself a captain.

368
00:16:01,117 --> 00:16:04,079
Eh, I don't feel all that
bad about it, actually.

369
00:16:04,162 --> 00:16:05,538
[YAMI]
Oh, really? 'Cause you should.

370
00:16:05,622 --> 00:16:08,166
All right, I've heard enough.

371
00:16:08,249 --> 00:16:09,584
I understand why some of you

372
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:11,628
may be feeling ashamed
of what happened.

373
00:16:11,711 --> 00:16:13,713
That being said,
I cannot and will not

374
00:16:13,797 --> 00:16:16,549
take away your
responsibilities as captains.

375
00:16:16,633 --> 00:16:17,634
If I did,

376
00:16:17,717 --> 00:16:19,219
I'd have to extend
the same treatment

377
00:16:19,302 --> 00:16:21,930
to the other Magic Knights who
fell under control of the elves,

378
00:16:22,013 --> 00:16:24,849
and that's a lot
of people to punish.

379
00:16:24,933 --> 00:16:26,101
Without them,

380
00:16:26,184 --> 00:16:28,228
we'd hardly have anyone
left to guard our land!

381
00:16:28,311 --> 00:16:30,855
If you truly want to
atone for your actions,

382
00:16:30,939 --> 00:16:32,982
your only option is
to forget your titles

383
00:16:33,066 --> 00:16:37,237
and work together to
protect the Clover Kingdom!

384
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,823
I'm putting my complete
trust in you all.

385
00:16:39,906 --> 00:16:41,116
[CHARLOTTE]
Sir!

386
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:42,325
[KAISER]
As you command.

387
00:16:42,409 --> 00:16:43,535
Roger that!

388
00:16:43,618 --> 00:16:46,621
For you, Wizard King.

389
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:48,081
So, Damnatio.

390
00:16:48,164 --> 00:16:50,458
Does this arrangement
work for you?

391
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:53,128
How do you mean, sir?

392
00:16:53,211 --> 00:16:54,629
[JULIUS]
As we established,

393
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:56,756
the Magic Knights need to
train for the next six months

394
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:00,635
in order to be successful in
their battle against the devil.

395
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:03,430
Asta's still waiting
to receive a sentence,

396
00:17:03,513 --> 00:17:05,098
but surely you can
table that decision

397
00:17:05,181 --> 00:17:07,851
until after this
is dealt with, yes?

398
00:17:10,353 --> 00:17:13,481
I suppose I don't object.

399
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:15,483
But let me be quite clear.

400
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:17,736
I've chosen to cooperate
only because I believe

401
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:19,446
this is the most
beneficial strategy

402
00:17:19,529 --> 00:17:22,407
for the Clover Kingdom at large.

403
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:25,035
Now, please excuse me.

404
00:17:27,328 --> 00:17:30,749
Tch. I know where he can
shove those damn scales.

405
00:17:30,832 --> 00:17:32,709
Wow, you really got me
off the hook, Wizard King,

406
00:17:32,792 --> 00:17:33,752
thank you so much.

407
00:17:33,835 --> 00:17:36,296
There's no need to thank me.

408
00:17:36,379 --> 00:17:39,758
[ASTA]
Okay, but I'm super grateful!

409
00:17:39,841 --> 00:17:42,135
Anyway, I'm expecting
great things from you.

410
00:17:42,218 --> 00:17:44,596
[cackles] You can depend on me!

411
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:47,682
I can't wait to slice
up my subordinates.

412
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:49,434
That's one way to trim the fat!

413
00:17:49,517 --> 00:17:51,061
[YAMI]
Not the point.

414
00:17:51,144 --> 00:17:52,687
This'll be fun!

415
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:53,688
I'll start creating

416
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:55,565
our training
regimen immediately.

417
00:17:55,648 --> 00:17:56,649
Actually, it might be best

418
00:17:56,733 --> 00:17:58,443
if all the squads
do this together.

419
00:17:58,526 --> 00:18:01,279
That's a good idea.
We could hold mock battles.

420
00:18:01,363 --> 00:18:03,823
[cackles] I'm not holding back!

421
00:18:03,907 --> 00:18:05,325
[YAMI]
That's my line, freak!

422
00:18:05,408 --> 00:18:07,494
Perhaps we should go ahead
and enlist a few healing mages.

423
00:18:07,577 --> 00:18:09,037
I'm sure we're
going to need them.

424
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,415
[laughs] Don't get
too carried away!

425
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:15,919
This is as good a time as any.

426
00:18:16,002 --> 00:18:17,587
Marx, why don't you
bring him in now?

427
00:18:17,671 --> 00:18:18,672
Yes, sir.

428
00:18:22,342 --> 00:18:23,551
Oh?

429
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:26,054
[YAMI]
Hey, it's the ham hock again.

430
00:18:26,137 --> 00:18:27,597
[JULIUS] Obviously,
all of you are familiar

431
00:18:27,681 --> 00:18:31,518
with Gueldre Poizot, the former
captain of the Purple Orcas.

432
00:18:31,601 --> 00:18:33,311
He was recently
caught in a crime,

433
00:18:33,395 --> 00:18:35,689
robbing the Shadow Palace.

434
00:18:35,772 --> 00:18:38,024
He and Revchi, the disgraced
former Magic Knight

435
00:18:38,108 --> 00:18:40,610
who was once his superior,
managed to get away

436
00:18:40,694 --> 00:18:42,654
with an enormous haul
of precious gems

437
00:18:42,737 --> 00:18:45,824
and ancient magic items.

438
00:18:45,907 --> 00:18:46,866
Scum.

439
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:49,202
Honestly, when will
you ever learn?

440
00:18:49,285 --> 00:18:50,954
I can't wait any longer.

441
00:18:51,037 --> 00:18:54,374
I'm going to slice this ham
into little bite-sized pieces!

442
00:18:54,457 --> 00:18:57,877
I'd be doing the kingdom
a service, right?

443
00:18:57,961 --> 00:18:59,963
[JULIUS]
That's not necessary.

444
00:19:00,046 --> 00:19:01,339
Because I've been
thinking I might

445
00:19:01,423 --> 00:19:03,466
like to pardon Gueldre instead.

446
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,592
Pardon him?

447
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:05,969
[GUELDRE]
What?

448
00:19:06,052 --> 00:19:08,847
This man happens to have
a great talent for business.

449
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:11,766
I believe he's capable of
turning an impressive profit

450
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:15,020
by selling the very treasures
that he attempted to purloin.

451
00:19:15,103 --> 00:19:16,479
[GUELDRE grunts]

452
00:19:16,563 --> 00:19:18,106
[JULIUS] I'd like him
to use that extra money

453
00:19:18,189 --> 00:19:20,191
for the benefit of
the Clover Kingdom.

454
00:19:20,275 --> 00:19:23,194
The repairs we've been doing
are far from cheap, after all,

455
00:19:23,278 --> 00:19:28,241
and we don't exactly have access
to infinite financial resources.

456
00:19:28,324 --> 00:19:30,160
You'll lend us your
services, won't you?

457
00:19:30,243 --> 00:19:32,370
Well... I don't know.

458
00:19:32,454 --> 00:19:34,080
[GUELDRE] Suddenly my life
depends on whether or not

459
00:19:34,164 --> 00:19:36,207
I can make a business deal?

460
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:37,709
Please?

461
00:19:37,792 --> 00:19:39,127
Yes, Your Highness!

462
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:41,296
I swear, I'll do
everything I can!

463
00:19:41,379 --> 00:19:43,465
[JULIUS]
Thank you, this is a big help.

464
00:19:43,548 --> 00:19:44,883
[GUELDRE]
Ah. Of course!

465
00:19:44,966 --> 00:19:47,385
[ASTA] He made him an offer
he couldn't refuse!

466
00:19:47,469 --> 00:19:50,221
[FINRAL] He's pushy like
Yami, but way sneakier!

467
00:19:50,305 --> 00:19:52,057
You better make sure
you fetch us a good price

468
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,475
at the market, little piggy!

469
00:19:53,558 --> 00:19:55,060
That's right, 'cause if
you screw this up,

470
00:19:55,143 --> 00:19:57,354
you're going straight
to the chopping block.

471
00:19:57,437 --> 00:19:59,105
There's just one more thing.

472
00:19:59,189 --> 00:20:01,107
As I explained to you all
a few moments ago,

473
00:20:01,191 --> 00:20:04,235
we do have certain limitations
when it comes to our finances.

474
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:06,946
Therefore, in order to alleviate
the financial burden

475
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:09,449
caused by our situation,
I'll need to reduce your pay

476
00:20:09,532 --> 00:20:10,617
by 50 percent.

477
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,951
[BOTH]
Huh?

478
00:20:12,035 --> 00:20:14,079
A logical solution, indeed.

479
00:20:14,162 --> 00:20:15,455
I can accept that.

480
00:20:15,538 --> 00:20:16,706
It's fine with me.

481
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,083
Yeah, it's okay.

482
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:19,334
No sweat!

483
00:20:19,417 --> 00:20:20,960
It's no problem at all.

484
00:20:21,044 --> 00:20:23,463
That's the least
that I could do.

485
00:20:23,546 --> 00:20:25,173
Well, that settles it, then!

486
00:20:25,256 --> 00:20:26,341
[YAMI]
Uh, I don't think so!

487
00:20:26,424 --> 00:20:27,967
Not happening!

488
00:20:28,051 --> 00:20:29,386
Is something wrong?

489
00:20:29,469 --> 00:20:32,013
Come on, man, I'm in debt,
you can't just cut my pay!

490
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:33,390
Do you want us to go broke?

491
00:20:33,473 --> 00:20:37,060
Uh... Remember, your
subordinates are present.

492
00:20:37,143 --> 00:20:38,269
Be an example!

493
00:20:38,353 --> 00:20:40,647
This is my example!

494
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:44,567
[JULIUS] Well, we decide these
things based on majority, so...

495
00:20:44,651 --> 00:20:46,945
Reduced pay, it is!

496
00:20:47,028 --> 00:20:48,571
[MARX]
With that, we now conclude

497
00:20:48,655 --> 00:20:51,074
the Magic Knights Squad
Captains' meeting.

498
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:55,245
[JACK, YAMI]
What a load of crap!

499
00:20:55,328 --> 00:20:56,996
[crash]

500
00:21:01,626 --> 00:21:04,254
How long do you plan
to act like drunken fools?

501
00:21:04,337 --> 00:21:05,880
I can't endure this.

502
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:09,759
Fine, go home then, nerd!
We can't expect you to care.

503
00:21:09,843 --> 00:21:12,178
Yeah, you nobles
are rich, anyway.

504
00:21:12,262 --> 00:21:14,264
You probably won't even
notice the difference

505
00:21:14,347 --> 00:21:16,850
when you lose half your pay!

506
00:21:18,393 --> 00:21:19,686
This is nonsense.

507
00:21:19,769 --> 00:21:22,814
[KAISER] I wish you'd learn
to drink in moderation.

508
00:21:22,897 --> 00:21:24,899
Bye! Don't throw up!

509
00:21:26,776 --> 00:21:29,320
I betcha old Goldiguts
can stick around.

510
00:21:29,404 --> 00:21:31,072
Yeah, you got time.

511
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:33,491
Come on, hero who
saved the kingdom!

512
00:21:33,575 --> 00:21:36,578
Do us a favor and join
us for a quick game.

513
00:21:36,661 --> 00:21:38,079
[WILLIAM]
Game?

514
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:42,125
We'll get our salary back
by making you gamble it away!

515
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:43,668
Fine, I'll play.

516
00:21:43,752 --> 00:21:46,296
[YAMI, JACK]
We're about to clean you out!

517
00:21:47,505 --> 00:21:50,925
[YAMI, JACK snoring]

518
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:52,552
Typical.

519
00:21:52,635 --> 00:21:55,263
I win again.

520
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:57,932
[YAMI]
I got three times my paycheck.

521
00:21:59,392 --> 00:22:01,644
I'm truly grateful
to both of you.

522
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:03,271
Despite what happened,

523
00:22:03,355 --> 00:22:06,816
you haven't treated me
the least bit differently.

524
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,526
You have my word.

525
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:13,948
I'm going to do everything in
my power to defeat that devil.

526
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:15,950
Goodnight, then.

527
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:17,118
Here you are, sir.

528
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:20,622
I'm sorry my friends
made such a racket.

529
00:22:20,705 --> 00:22:22,415
[BARKEEP 130AA]
Thank you very much.

530
00:23:56,551 --> 00:23:58,428
[NARRATOR] The Magic Knight
squads begin preparing

531
00:23:58,511 --> 00:24:00,513
for their confrontation
with Megicula.

532
00:24:00,597 --> 00:24:04,059
Meanwhile, Asta and Yuno
pay a visit to Hage Village.

533
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:07,937
<i>Black Clover</i> , Page 131:
"A New Resolve."

534
00:24:08,021 --> 00:24:10,774
The road to becoming
Wizard King stretches on!
