00:00:22,554 --> 00:00:24,180
[NARRATOR]
The Clover Kingdom.

2
00:00:24,264 --> 00:00:26,641
In this place where
magic is everything,

3
00:00:26,725 --> 00:00:29,561
there lives one boy who
was born without it.

4
00:00:29,644 --> 00:00:31,980
His name is Asta.

5
00:00:33,189 --> 00:00:34,607
[NARRATOR]
His strength and determination

6
00:00:34,691 --> 00:00:36,943
helped him become
a Magic Knight.

7
00:00:37,027 --> 00:00:39,612
And despite the many
challenges he faces,

8
00:00:39,696 --> 00:00:43,658
he aims for the top
and refuses to give up!

9
00:00:43,742 --> 00:00:45,410
Rich or poor,

10
00:00:45,493 --> 00:00:47,537
royalty or commoner,

11
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,415
Asta believes anyone can shine.

12
00:00:50,498 --> 00:00:53,460
His mission is to prove
that to the whole world,

13
00:00:53,543 --> 00:00:56,671
and to become the
next Wizard King!

14
00:00:57,714 --> 00:01:00,133
[NARRATOR] Asta and the others
traveled to the Heart Kingdom

15
00:01:00,216 --> 00:01:04,471
to learn more about the devil's
curse, but Asta was abducted,

16
00:01:04,554 --> 00:01:06,306
leaving Noelle,
Mimosa, and Finral

17
00:01:06,389 --> 00:01:09,517
to do battle with the
Spirit Guardian Gaja.

18
00:01:09,601 --> 00:01:10,727
Meanwhile,

19
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:13,188
Asta was forced into
a confrontation as well,

20
00:01:13,271 --> 00:01:16,775
against a powerful Water Spirit
by the name of Undine.

21
00:01:16,858 --> 00:01:18,568
[UNDINE]
You may address me as Undine.

22
00:01:18,651 --> 00:01:20,362
I'm one of the
Four Great Spirits,

23
00:01:20,445 --> 00:01:23,615
and I'm contracted to the
Queen of the Heart Kingdom.

24
00:01:23,698 --> 00:01:24,991
[NARRATOR]
Undine and Gaja:

25
00:01:25,075 --> 00:01:26,993
both presented
serious challenges

26
00:01:27,077 --> 00:01:29,287
for Asta and his companions.

27
00:01:29,371 --> 00:01:30,705
But...

28
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:33,500
[SECRÉ]
Sealing Magic: Inverse Release!

29
00:01:33,583 --> 00:01:34,876
[NOELLE]
Here's the deal.

30
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:38,213
We can't just back down
after watching you show off!

31
00:01:38,296 --> 00:01:40,507
Mind if I join you?

32
00:03:16,186 --> 00:03:17,520
[gasps]

33
00:03:21,066 --> 00:03:22,609
[ASTA]
That's weird.

34
00:03:22,692 --> 00:03:25,695
I could've sworn I sensed
somebody's ki here.

35
00:03:27,155 --> 00:03:28,323
[gasps]

36
00:03:30,575 --> 00:03:34,329
[ASTA]
Uh. Hey.

37
00:03:34,412 --> 00:03:35,955
[LOROPECHIKA]
Oh, my gosh, I am so sorry!

38
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:38,958
This thick beaver pelt just felt
so nice and soft on my skin!

39
00:03:39,042 --> 00:03:41,086
[ASTA groans]

40
00:03:42,712 --> 00:03:47,258
[ASTA]
What was that for?!

41
00:03:48,259 --> 00:03:51,012
[LOROPECHIKA]
Where'd my glasses go?

42
00:03:52,305 --> 00:03:53,682
Loropechika.

43
00:03:53,765 --> 00:03:55,767
What in the world
are you up to now?

44
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:58,186
I told you to hurry up and
change out of your pajamas,

45
00:03:58,269 --> 00:03:59,771
we have guests!

46
00:03:59,854 --> 00:04:01,981
Right, I apologize.

47
00:04:04,734 --> 00:04:08,071
[ASTA] So that girl's the
Queen of the Heart Kingdom?

48
00:04:13,451 --> 00:04:17,872
[GAJA] I only survived
thanks to my defensive spell.

49
00:04:17,956 --> 00:04:21,876
It appears she was holding
back. What a great talent.

50
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,670
As for the others...

51
00:04:31,344 --> 00:04:32,971
[NOELLE]
He's so fast!

52
00:04:34,014 --> 00:04:36,474
Please forgive my rudeness.

53
00:04:36,558 --> 00:04:38,143
I forced you into
a battle with me

54
00:04:38,226 --> 00:04:41,563
so that I could accurately
judge your magic stages.

55
00:04:41,646 --> 00:04:43,064
Uh...

56
00:04:43,148 --> 00:04:44,607
[SECRÉ]
Magic stages?

57
00:04:44,691 --> 00:04:46,818
Is that the scale
I heard about before,

58
00:04:46,901 --> 00:04:50,613
where, the smaller the number
is, the more capable you are?

59
00:04:50,697 --> 00:04:52,198
[LOROPECHIKA] Yes. Here,
strength is judged

60
00:04:52,282 --> 00:04:55,243
by magic power,
not the number of foes.

61
00:04:55,326 --> 00:04:57,495
For example, if there was
one mage ranked very high

62
00:04:57,579 --> 00:04:59,122
in the scale,
he might be victorious

63
00:04:59,205 --> 00:05:02,375
against dozens of lesser
opponents at the same time.

64
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:04,919
So, in a war between
magical nations, each side

65
00:05:05,003 --> 00:05:09,215
is generally judged by the magic
stages of their military forces.

66
00:05:09,299 --> 00:05:11,176
More specifically,
a kingdom's power

67
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:13,636
is typically determined by
the number of mages it has

68
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,722
who are ranked near stage zero.

69
00:05:15,805 --> 00:05:17,974
Of course, if it's a devil
you're dealing with,

70
00:05:18,058 --> 00:05:19,684
any fighter who's
lower than stage one

71
00:05:19,768 --> 00:05:21,019
won't be able
to hold their own.

72
00:05:21,102 --> 00:05:24,522
[ASTA]
A devil. That's why we're here!

73
00:05:24,606 --> 00:05:27,692
The thing is, we came because we
picked up a huge curse signal,

74
00:05:27,776 --> 00:05:29,569
and a devil's gotta
be the cause of it!

75
00:05:29,652 --> 00:05:30,737
[gasps]

76
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,072
[UNDINE]
How did they find out something

77
00:05:32,155 --> 00:05:34,699
only Spirit Guardians
should know?

78
00:05:34,783 --> 00:05:37,911
[ASTA] Can you guys tell us
anything about devil curses?

79
00:05:37,994 --> 00:05:39,746
[SECRÉ]
Always so direct.

80
00:05:39,829 --> 00:05:41,122
[UNDINE]
Unfortunately for you,

81
00:05:41,206 --> 00:05:43,708
no one will ever
talk about them.

82
00:05:43,792 --> 00:05:45,835
Actually, I happen to suffer

83
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,172
from a devil curse myself.
If nothing's done about it,

84
00:05:49,255 --> 00:05:51,341
I'll be dead
within a year or so.

85
00:05:51,424 --> 00:05:52,676
--[ASTA] Huh?
--[SECRÉ gasps]

86
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:53,802
Honestly!

87
00:05:53,885 --> 00:05:54,969
Huh?

88
00:05:55,053 --> 00:05:57,263
Why? Why would you
tell them that? Fool!

89
00:05:57,347 --> 00:05:58,098
[LOROPECHIKA]
Uh...

90
00:05:58,181 --> 00:05:58,973
[UNDINE]
Huh?

91
00:05:59,057 --> 00:06:01,309
[LOROPECHIKA]
Uh!

92
00:06:01,393 --> 00:06:04,062
Oh, sweet Loropechika,
that adorable ignorance of yours

93
00:06:04,145 --> 00:06:07,440
will be the end of me
one day, I just know it!

94
00:06:07,524 --> 00:06:08,817
It's true.

95
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,485
The reason we brought
the two of you to this place

96
00:06:10,568 --> 00:06:13,697
against your will and tried
to discern your magic stages,

97
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:16,741
is because we desire
to defeat Megicula.

98
00:06:16,825 --> 00:06:18,785
the devil who cast this curse.

99
00:06:18,868 --> 00:06:20,745
[gasps]

100
00:06:20,829 --> 00:06:24,040
[UNDINE] Clearly, you stand
to benefit from this as well.

101
00:06:24,124 --> 00:06:26,626
So, residents of
the Clover Kingdom,

102
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:28,128
please join us--

103
00:06:28,211 --> 00:06:29,045
[gasps]

104
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:30,630
[ASTA]
Yeah? What's wrong?

105
00:06:30,714 --> 00:06:31,840
[LOROPECHIKA]
Excuse me!

106
00:06:31,923 --> 00:06:33,967
I forgot to water
the poplatatta trees!

107
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:36,636
[ASTA]
Really? I'm pretty sure we were

108
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,513
in the middle of a life-and-
death conversation here,

109
00:06:38,596 --> 00:06:40,849
but hey, do what
you gotta do, I guess!

110
00:06:40,932 --> 00:06:42,475
If this is the way
their queen behaves,

111
00:06:42,559 --> 00:06:44,894
then I'm very
concerned about them.

112
00:07:03,371 --> 00:07:05,331
[ASTA]
Whoa, this is so crazy!

113
00:07:05,415 --> 00:07:09,002
Okay, here you go. Drink up!

114
00:07:12,297 --> 00:07:13,381
Oh, my.

115
00:07:13,465 --> 00:07:15,925
The zozo squirrels
are energetic as ever.

116
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:17,469
Uh-oh, slow down there, Michely,

117
00:07:17,552 --> 00:07:19,679
it's dangerous if
you run too quickly.

118
00:07:19,763 --> 00:07:21,556
It looks like old man
Kakalasa's cough

119
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:23,350
is starting to clear up now.

120
00:07:23,433 --> 00:07:27,020
And look, the totohl fruits are
growing so splendidly as well!

121
00:07:27,103 --> 00:07:29,105
It's good to see
everything going smoothly.

122
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:31,608
She's watering the
whole place at once!

123
00:07:31,691 --> 00:07:34,319
[SECRÉ] She sees the entire
kingdom at a glance,

124
00:07:34,402 --> 00:07:37,364
and singlehandedly
controls the water.

125
00:07:37,447 --> 00:07:40,367
She has an all-encompassing
warmth about her,

126
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:44,037
so no living thing in her
domain goes uncared for.

127
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,749
This magic is fitting for the
Queen of the Heart Kingdom.

128
00:07:47,832 --> 00:07:49,626
[UNDINE]
Now, now, Loropechika.

129
00:07:49,709 --> 00:07:52,837
How about we change you
into more appropriate attire?

130
00:07:52,921 --> 00:07:55,548
You see, our current ruler
has inherited the ability

131
00:07:55,632 --> 00:07:58,468
of most of the queens
who've gone before her.

132
00:07:58,551 --> 00:08:01,471
She's our beautiful
kingdom's guardian deity,

133
00:08:01,554 --> 00:08:04,808
the all-knowing priestess.

134
00:08:04,891 --> 00:08:07,018
Therefore, we simply
cannot lose someone

135
00:08:07,102 --> 00:08:09,521
as precious as her
to a devil's curse.

136
00:08:09,604 --> 00:08:11,690
There is no one else like her!

137
00:08:15,402 --> 00:08:17,570
[gasps]

138
00:08:17,654 --> 00:08:19,072
[UNDINE]
That's better.

139
00:08:19,155 --> 00:08:21,491
You're quite pretty when you
put in the effort, you know.

140
00:08:21,574 --> 00:08:24,869
[LOROPECHIKA]
Ugh, it's hard to walk in this.

141
00:08:24,953 --> 00:08:26,621
[gasps]

142
00:08:26,705 --> 00:08:28,289
[LOROPECHIKA yells]

143
00:08:28,373 --> 00:08:29,416
[ASTA]
Come on!

144
00:08:29,499 --> 00:08:31,501
[UNDINE]
What am I going to do with you?

145
00:08:31,584 --> 00:08:33,044
[ASTA]
Hey, I get it!

146
00:08:33,128 --> 00:08:35,797
The clumsiness must be part
of the devil's curse, too, huh?

147
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,550
[LOROPECHIKA] Oh, no,
I'm just naturally a klutz.

148
00:08:38,633 --> 00:08:40,510
[ASTA]
Wow, that's bad!

149
00:08:40,593 --> 00:08:43,179
[UNDINE]
Megicula, that loathsome devil

150
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:45,598
who cursed my dear Loropechika,

151
00:08:45,682 --> 00:08:48,643
is currently in
the Diamond Kingdom.

152
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:58,236
[MAGNA] We came to scout the
Diamond Kingdom to be safe.

153
00:08:58,319 --> 00:08:59,654
[VANESSA]
What happened?

154
00:09:05,869 --> 00:09:07,078
[VANESSA]
He wiped out all of those

155
00:09:07,162 --> 00:09:09,289
Diamond soldiers on his own.

156
00:09:09,372 --> 00:09:11,958
[MAGNA] And some of them were
as tough as our captains.

157
00:09:12,042 --> 00:09:13,835
Who is this guy?

[laughing]

Don't you go getting
any bright ideas, Luck.

160
00:09:20,633 --> 00:09:22,010
As much as I hate to admit it,

161
00:09:22,093 --> 00:09:24,763
I've never felt like
this in my whole life.

162
00:09:24,846 --> 00:09:26,431
Believe it or not,

163
00:09:26,514 --> 00:09:28,933
I don't wanna fight this guy.

164

[footsteps]

00:09:42,989 --> 00:09:44,199
Oh, guys!

--[ASTA] Hey!

You're the worst.
Stop getting kidnapped!

169
00:09:50,038 --> 00:09:52,582
It's starting to get really old!

170
00:09:52,665 --> 00:09:55,251
Her Majesty the Queen is here.

171
00:09:55,335 --> 00:09:56,753
[GROUP]
Huh?

172
00:10:06,054 --> 00:10:08,598
[MIMOSA]
She's so majestic, and the magic

173
00:10:08,682 --> 00:10:11,726
that she possesses
is immeasurable!

174
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:14,646
[NOELLE] So that's the Queen
of the Heart Kingdom.

175
00:10:14,729 --> 00:10:17,357
Wow, talk about
a treat for the eyes!

176
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,067
How lucky am I
to be in the presence

177
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,069
of such an exceptional goddess?

178
00:10:21,152 --> 00:10:24,197
Wait, stop it, Finral, you're
supposed to be better than that!

179
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,783
You're a one-woman man
from now on, remember?

180
00:10:26,866 --> 00:10:27,784
Get it together, would ya?

181
00:10:27,867 --> 00:10:30,787
What's goin' on?
Is Finral okay?

182
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,038
Nope.

Residents of the Clover Kingdom.

184
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:38,420
I humbly ask that you
lend your strength to us.

185
00:10:39,462 --> 00:10:41,673
[yells]

186
00:10:41,756 --> 00:10:43,008
[MIMOSA, NOELLE]
Really?!

187
00:10:43,091 --> 00:10:44,884
[UNDINE]
Come now, Loropechika,

188
00:10:44,968 --> 00:10:47,220
do try to behave
more like a queen!

189
00:10:47,303 --> 00:10:50,765
Oh, a nosebleed.
Aw, you're still adorable!

190
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,061
What happened?

191
00:10:55,145 --> 00:10:57,605
[LOROPECHIKA]
Aw. I got blood on my dress.

192
00:10:57,689 --> 00:11:00,525
[UNDINE] Of course.
All right, give me a moment.

193
00:11:00,608 --> 00:11:02,444
This is precisely
why I was so against

194
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,863
her conducting this
meeting in person.

195
00:11:07,615 --> 00:11:09,659
[ASTA]
I guess now that that's over,

196
00:11:09,743 --> 00:11:11,369
what did you need our help with?

197
00:11:11,453 --> 00:11:12,579
I was under the impression

198
00:11:12,662 --> 00:11:14,164
that the Heart Kingdom
had plenty of mages

199
00:11:14,247 --> 00:11:15,665
at stage one or higher,

200
00:11:15,749 --> 00:11:18,877
not to mention the Spirit
Guardians, so what can we do?

201
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,712
As I explained,
when battling a devil,

202
00:11:20,795 --> 00:11:22,380
every mage involved
needs to be ranked

203
00:11:22,464 --> 00:11:25,050
at least stage one
in order to keep up.

204
00:11:25,133 --> 00:11:27,385
But even a zero
still wouldn't have

205
00:11:27,469 --> 00:11:29,304
what it takes to
achieve victory.

206
00:11:29,387 --> 00:11:30,889
[gasps]

207
00:11:30,972 --> 00:11:33,224
[LOROPECHIKA] You see, Spirit
Guardians are able to wield

208
00:11:33,308 --> 00:11:36,561
powerful magic by borrowing
energy from natural mana,

209
00:11:36,644 --> 00:11:38,980
but they cannot defeat a devil.

210
00:11:39,064 --> 00:11:41,858
Unlike us, your kingdom created
magic types that are not

211
00:11:41,941 --> 00:11:44,527
derived from nature,
such as Chain, Steel,

212
00:11:44,611 --> 00:11:46,446
and the eccentric Spatial Magic.

213
00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:48,865
In exchange, they lose
the divine protection

214
00:11:48,948 --> 00:11:51,201
of natural mana.

215
00:11:51,284 --> 00:11:53,119
And some of the
irregulars who were born

216
00:11:53,203 --> 00:11:55,622
in that environment have
the necessary traits

217
00:11:55,705 --> 00:11:56,915
to best a devil.

218
00:11:56,998 --> 00:11:58,750
[GROUP gasps]

219
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:01,294
[LOROPECHIKA] One example
of this is Julius Novachrono,

220
00:12:01,378 --> 00:12:03,088
who possesses Time Magic.

221
00:12:03,171 --> 00:12:06,007
There is also the Black Bulls'
Captain Yami Sukehiro

222
00:12:06,091 --> 00:12:08,343
and his Dark Magic.

223
00:12:08,426 --> 00:12:11,513
Unfortunately, it appears
the majority of Julius's power

224
00:12:11,596 --> 00:12:13,306
has been used up at this point.

225
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,349
[gasps]

226
00:12:14,432 --> 00:12:15,892
[NOELLE]
She knows about that?

227
00:12:15,975 --> 00:12:19,062
I wonder how much
information she has.

228
00:12:19,145 --> 00:12:24,317
And you. Asta and Nero.

229
00:12:24,401 --> 00:12:27,445
For combat, Nero's
about a stage six,

230
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:29,322
but she's got
ancient Sealing Magic

231
00:12:29,406 --> 00:12:32,033
and has used forbidden magic.

232
00:12:32,117 --> 00:12:34,619
Asta has no mana,
but because of that,

233
00:12:34,703 --> 00:12:38,373
he was granted the
use of Anti-magic.

234
00:12:38,456 --> 00:12:40,625
People like you two
who possess unique,

235
00:12:40,709 --> 00:12:46,297
inexplicable powers are
referred to as "arcane stages."

236
00:12:47,757 --> 00:12:50,385
So we're...

237
00:12:50,468 --> 00:12:52,470
[LOROPECHIKA] I would like you
to lend us your arcane powers

238
00:12:52,554 --> 00:12:54,514
to help us defeat that devil.

239
00:12:54,597 --> 00:12:56,266
And, as a reward,
I will happily share

240
00:12:56,349 --> 00:12:58,768
any information that
I have with you.

241
00:12:58,852 --> 00:13:00,103
But we don't have the authority

to make a major
decision like that!

Well, I happen to be doing
somethin' important myself.

247
00:13:15,035 --> 00:13:17,996
In fact, this could be one
for the history books.

You're on his side?!

vulgar things, Loropechika!

00:13:27,047 --> 00:13:28,590
[giggles]

254
00:13:28,673 --> 00:13:30,258
Well, I had my suspicions

255
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:31,676
that something like
this would happen,

256
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,595
so I borrowed a magic item
that allows us to connect

257
00:13:33,678 --> 00:13:35,597
with the Transmission
Magic that Marx uses.

258
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,723
[NOELLE]
Good thinking!

[ASTA]
Nice one, Mimosa!

00:13:38,391 --> 00:13:40,477
All right, let's try it out.

261
00:13:41,603 --> 00:13:44,939
[MARX]
Mimosa. Did something happen?

262
00:13:45,023 --> 00:13:46,775
Wait, is that who I think it is?

263
00:13:46,858 --> 00:13:49,194
Oh, wow! You must be the
Queen of Heart Kingdom!

264
00:13:49,277 --> 00:13:51,780
So what kind of
magic do you use?

265
00:13:51,863 --> 00:13:54,491
[MARX] Please don't pop into the
frame like that, Your Majesty!

266
00:13:54,574 --> 00:13:58,036
Have you forgotten about your
condition? People will see!

267
00:13:58,119 --> 00:14:00,163
[JULIUS] Well, you just
called me "Your Majesty,"

268
00:14:00,246 --> 00:14:01,498
so now they know it's me.

269
00:14:01,581 --> 00:14:03,166
--[MARX] Ah!
--[JULIUS laughs]

270
00:14:03,249 --> 00:14:05,752
[ASTA] Ah, it's no big deal,
the queen already knew.

271
00:14:05,835 --> 00:14:07,837
[MARX]
What?!

272
00:14:07,921 --> 00:14:09,339
[ASTA]
So, anyway.

273
00:14:09,422 --> 00:14:11,424
She says they need our
help to beat a devil

274
00:14:11,508 --> 00:14:14,094
because we're arcane stage,
or something like that.

275
00:14:14,177 --> 00:14:15,679
That's fine by me.

276
00:14:15,762 --> 00:14:18,723
You and your friends could gain
something amazing from all this.

277
00:14:18,807 --> 00:14:21,976
Honestly, I think I'd like to be
over there helping you, myself.

278
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,395
That's out of the question!

279
00:14:23,478 --> 00:14:25,480
I suppose that settles it then.

280
00:14:25,563 --> 00:14:27,065
How wonderful!

281
00:14:27,148 --> 00:14:28,525
Then again, if you
tried to fight a devil

282
00:14:28,608 --> 00:14:30,485
in your current state,
you would all be slaughtered

283
00:14:30,568 --> 00:14:32,153
in the blink of an eye.

284
00:14:32,237 --> 00:14:34,406
[ASTA]
That's kinda blunt.

285
00:14:34,489 --> 00:14:36,533
I mean, is the Spade Devil
really supposed to be

286
00:14:36,616 --> 00:14:38,743
that impossible to take down?

287
00:14:38,827 --> 00:14:40,620
Yes. Even more deadly

288
00:14:40,704 --> 00:14:43,415
than the devil you
fought with previously.

289
00:14:43,498 --> 00:14:45,792
[ASTA]
Worse than him?

290
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:47,711
We only won that time
because we had help

291
00:14:47,794 --> 00:14:50,213
from super-powerful people
like the First Wizard King

292
00:14:50,296 --> 00:14:51,840
and the leader of the elves.

293
00:14:51,923 --> 00:14:54,092
And even then,
it was a close call!

294
00:14:54,175 --> 00:14:55,593
[LOROPECHIKA]
Megicula is responsible

295
00:14:55,677 --> 00:14:57,429
for the scar on Gaja's face.

296
00:14:57,512 --> 00:14:59,389
[NOELLE] What? But we
barely stood a chance

Ah, yes, I remember dueling

fellow in the past.

300

302
00:15:10,358 --> 00:15:12,485
[NOELLE] So, even
someone the Wizard King

speaks that highly of isn't
able to defeat this devil?

[ASTA] The way we are
now, we can't win.

We have to get stronger!

Megicula is currently haunting

the Spade Kingdom, and using
its citizens to gather up

308
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:31,838
enormous amounts of power.

309
00:15:31,921 --> 00:15:34,341
Soon, that devil could
invade and conquer

310
00:15:34,424 --> 00:15:38,219
not only the Heart Kingdom,
but Clover and Diamond as well.

then I will eventually
be killed by this curse.

That's why I'd like to
invade the Spade Kingdom

315
00:15:47,354 --> 00:15:49,898
before my power
becomes too weak.

316
00:15:51,775 --> 00:15:53,860
We can take half a year.

317
00:15:53,943 --> 00:15:57,364
Let's make our forces
as strong as we can.

318
00:15:57,447 --> 00:15:59,657
We should enlist any mages
who stand a chance

319
00:15:59,741 --> 00:16:01,701
in battle against a devil.

320
00:16:01,785 --> 00:16:03,745
Train for six months,

321
00:16:03,828 --> 00:16:06,956
then, we will fight
together to stop Megicula.

322
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,291
If you help us...

323
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:10,126
[ALL]
...we can do it!

324
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:20,553
[MARX] Sir, are you certain
you approve of this?

325
00:16:20,637 --> 00:16:23,556
Remember, the Magic Knights
are still exhausted

326
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,058
from fighting the elves.

327
00:16:25,141 --> 00:16:28,937
It's true that we have half
a year, but this is a devil.

328
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:33,191
Just think of the casualties,
for Clover and for Heart.

329
00:16:33,274 --> 00:16:34,651
I take it you heard the report

330
00:16:34,734 --> 00:16:37,779
from the scouts
we sent out, Marx?

331
00:16:37,862 --> 00:16:39,906
Considering the state
Diamond is in,

332
00:16:39,989 --> 00:16:41,991
our only hope is to
have our Magic Knights

333
00:16:42,075 --> 00:16:44,285
improve their skills.

334
00:16:44,369 --> 00:16:46,037
I'm sure the Queen
of the Heart Kingdom

335
00:16:46,121 --> 00:16:48,081
knows that, as well.

336
00:16:48,164 --> 00:16:49,708
I guess you're right.

337
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:53,586
[JULIUS] Assemble all of the
Magic Knight Squad Captains.

338
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:54,921
Sir!

339
00:16:58,383 --> 00:17:01,386
[CHARMY munching]

340
00:17:01,469 --> 00:17:03,930
How long is Captain Yami
gonna make us wait?

341
00:17:04,014 --> 00:17:06,516
We've got a major
announcement to make, here!

342
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,768
Keep your voice down,
you little shrimp.

343
00:17:08,852 --> 00:17:10,854
We all know that the captain
can't do his business

344
00:17:10,937 --> 00:17:12,647
if he doesn't have
peace and quiet.

345
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:14,399
[ASTA]
Pooping again?

346
00:17:15,984 --> 00:17:17,235
Woo nelly.

347
00:17:17,318 --> 00:17:18,653
Wait a minute, don't tell
me you've been in there

348
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:19,988
since we called you?

349
00:17:20,071 --> 00:17:21,823
The war's not over yet.

350
00:17:21,906 --> 00:17:24,451
Trust me, I'd love to kick back
and celebrate today's victory,

351
00:17:24,534 --> 00:17:27,370
but the next battle's already
startin' to rear its ugly head.

352
00:17:27,454 --> 00:17:29,622
Metaphors or not,
it's still gross.

353
00:17:29,706 --> 00:17:31,291
Well, anyway, let's
hear what went down

354
00:17:31,374 --> 00:17:33,084
during your visit
to the Heart Kingdom.

355
00:17:33,168 --> 00:17:34,502
[FINRAL]
Oh, yes, sir!

356
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:37,130
It was so eventful,
I'm not sure where to begin.

357
00:17:37,213 --> 00:17:38,465
Get this!

358
00:17:38,548 --> 00:17:40,342
We found out who was cursed
by a devil over there,

359
00:17:40,425 --> 00:17:41,676
and it's the queen,
of all people.

360
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,261
Pretty crazy, right?

361
00:17:43,345 --> 00:17:45,013
[NOELLE] And if the curse
isn't broken soon,

362
00:17:45,096 --> 00:17:47,390
then she's only
got a year to live.

363
00:17:47,474 --> 00:17:50,185
[FINRAL] Since she was chosen by
one of the Four Great Spirits,

364
00:17:50,268 --> 00:17:52,645
she's the most powerful
mage they've got.

365
00:17:52,729 --> 00:17:57,233
If they lose someone like that,
they're in big trouble.

366
00:17:57,317 --> 00:18:01,446
[sighs] Obviously, we should
keep all that on the down-low.

367
00:18:01,529 --> 00:18:03,740
I hope you at least got a little
bit of useful information

368
00:18:03,823 --> 00:18:06,242
on the devil, too.

369
00:18:06,326 --> 00:18:08,495
We have a name. Megicula.

370
00:18:08,578 --> 00:18:11,289
And a location!
In the Spade Kingdom!

371
00:18:11,373 --> 00:18:13,041
In Spade?

372
00:18:13,124 --> 00:18:14,167
If that's really true,

373
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,211
then what we saw
makes a lot of sense.

374
00:18:16,294 --> 00:18:19,089
Huh? Did you guys
find somethin' weird?

375
00:18:19,172 --> 00:18:20,590
Apparently, when they
went to check out

376
00:18:20,674 --> 00:18:23,093
the Diamond Kingdom, they ran
into one of Spade's mages

377
00:18:23,176 --> 00:18:24,386
close to the border.

378
00:18:24,469 --> 00:18:25,929
Whoa, really?

379
00:18:26,012 --> 00:18:30,350
Except, he wasn't
just a normal mage.

380
00:18:30,433 --> 00:18:33,812
[MAGNA] There were hundreds of
Diamond soldiers on the ground.

381
00:18:33,895 --> 00:18:36,731
He beat them all by himself
like it was nothing.

382
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:39,526
[VANESSA] And that cold,
dark magic he had.

383
00:18:39,609 --> 00:18:44,280
I wouldn't be surprised
if he got it from a devil.

384
00:18:44,364 --> 00:18:46,408
I don't know if it's
possible, but I wonder

385
00:18:46,491 --> 00:18:49,494
if we might've seen Megicula
without even realizing it!

386
00:18:49,577 --> 00:18:50,787
Oh, no.

387
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:52,914
If that's him, then
the Diamond Kingdom is...

388
00:18:52,997 --> 00:18:54,249
[YAMI]
Pretty much done for.

389
00:18:54,332 --> 00:18:56,543
All because of that one guy.

390
00:19:01,965 --> 00:19:04,426
[ASTA]
But, Mars...

391
00:19:04,509 --> 00:19:07,220
Even from that distance,
one thing was obvious.

392
00:19:07,303 --> 00:19:09,764
That man could've
easily killed us.

393
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:11,266
If we had picked
a fight with him,

394
00:19:11,349 --> 00:19:14,310
we'd have suffered the same fate
as those Diamond soldiers.

395
00:19:14,394 --> 00:19:16,563
Yeah, you're not
tough enough yet.

396
00:19:16,646 --> 00:19:19,024
If we can't defeat that devil,
then both the Heart Kingdom

397
00:19:19,107 --> 00:19:21,735
and the Clover Kingdom
are gonna be history.

398
00:19:21,818 --> 00:19:26,573
So the only solution
is to try to get stronger.

399
00:19:26,656 --> 00:19:29,159
The queen told us to spend
six months training.

400
00:19:29,242 --> 00:19:30,493
And after that,
the Heart Kingdom

401
00:19:30,577 --> 00:19:33,079
will launch their attack
on the Spade Kingdom.

402
00:19:33,163 --> 00:19:35,582
As Magic Knights, it's our
job to spend every minute

403
00:19:35,665 --> 00:19:38,626
of the next six months getting
as powerful as we can.

404
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,837
And then we'll be able to
help them defeat Megicula

405
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,464
and keep everybody safe!

406
00:19:42,547 --> 00:19:43,840
One thing.

407
00:19:43,923 --> 00:19:45,467
[ASTA]
What is it, Zora?

408
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,885
Just so we're clear,

409
00:19:46,968 --> 00:19:48,887
are you sure training
is all we have to do?

410
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:51,598
'Cause beating a devil is
hard, even for the best of us.

411
00:19:51,681 --> 00:19:53,600
[SECRÉ] Unless we're
stage one mages or higher,

412
00:19:53,683 --> 00:19:55,894
we won't even be
able to keep up.

413
00:19:55,977 --> 00:19:58,438
To put that into terms that
we're more familiar with,

414
00:19:58,521 --> 00:20:01,524
that would be like a
First-Class Senior Magic Knight.

415
00:20:01,608 --> 00:20:05,070
No, even that wouldn't be
good enough in this situation.

416
00:20:05,153 --> 00:20:06,654
[MAGNA]
Wait a minute.

417
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:08,448
Are you telling us we have to
get up to a vice captain's level

418
00:20:08,531 --> 00:20:09,699
in just six months?

419
00:20:09,783 --> 00:20:12,535
[VANESSA]
Heh. Easier said than done.

420
00:20:12,619 --> 00:20:14,245
Unfortunately,
as far as we know,

421
00:20:14,329 --> 00:20:16,122
the only people in our
kingdom who stand a chance

422
00:20:16,206 --> 00:20:18,625
of defeating the devil are
mages whose power lands them

423
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,752
in the arcane stage,
including Asta,

424
00:20:20,835 --> 00:20:22,962
Nero, Captain Yami,
and the Wizard King.

425
00:20:23,046 --> 00:20:24,631
Well, whether I have
what it takes or not,

426
00:20:24,714 --> 00:20:27,926
I refuse to give up. We can
all get there eventually!

427
00:20:28,009 --> 00:20:28,927
Right?

428
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:30,387
[NOELLE]
I have to.

429
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:32,889
Megicula is the one
who killed my mother.

430
00:20:32,972 --> 00:20:35,684
Hear that? Put your
big-boy pants on!

431
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:38,311
The royal just said that
she's not gonna give up.

432
00:20:38,395 --> 00:20:39,562
And since we outrank her,

433
00:20:39,646 --> 00:20:41,815
we're not allowed to
chicken out, you got it?

434
00:20:41,898 --> 00:20:45,151
Yeah. That wasn't like me, huh?

435
00:20:45,235 --> 00:20:46,986
After all, our friend's
life is on the line,

436
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:49,197
so I can't afford
to give into fear.

437
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,825
Wait. What friend is this now?

438
00:20:51,908 --> 00:20:53,076
[murmuring] I'll do
everything in my power

439
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:55,078
to make myself a stage one mage.

440
00:20:55,161 --> 00:20:58,081
That way I can look out
for my bestest buddy, Asta.

441
00:20:58,164 --> 00:20:59,582
Crap, I forgot!

442
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:01,876
If I don't do something about
this Megicula thing soon,

443
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,461
I'm gonna be sentenced to death!

444
00:21:03,545 --> 00:21:05,588
How could you forget?

445
00:21:05,672 --> 00:21:08,008
I guess there's no choice, then.

446
00:21:08,091 --> 00:21:10,427
[ZORA] No self-respecting
Magic Knight would let a devil

447
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:12,303
run wild and do whatever
it wants, right?

448
00:21:12,387 --> 00:21:14,055
All right! I'm in!

449
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:16,641
I have no idea what
I can do to help out,

450
00:21:16,725 --> 00:21:18,852
but I'll try my hardest!

451
00:21:18,935 --> 00:21:20,645
[FINRAL] I'll use these
six months to make myself

452
00:21:20,729 --> 00:21:24,858
an even more powerful mage and
get rid of that terrible curse!

453
00:21:24,941 --> 00:21:28,570
Maybe then I'll be worthy
of Lady Finnes's heart.

454
00:21:28,653 --> 00:21:31,740
[NOELLE] After we stop Megicula
and the curse has been broken,

455
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:35,702
I wanna talk to Nozel
again about our mother.

456
00:21:37,412 --> 00:21:40,790
[ASTA] All that matters right
now is beating that devil!

457
00:21:40,874 --> 00:21:42,334
And then, maybe I can understand

458
00:21:42,417 --> 00:21:45,003
a little more about
my own devil, too.

459
00:21:45,086 --> 00:21:48,173
[SECRÉ] For the sake of their
futures and this world,

460
00:21:48,256 --> 00:21:50,300
I can't let another
devil take control.

461
00:21:50,383 --> 00:21:52,135
[clapping]

462
00:21:52,218 --> 00:21:53,595
Okay, for the next six months,

463
00:21:53,678 --> 00:21:55,305
I'm just gonna let
the Black Bulls loose,

464
00:21:55,388 --> 00:21:57,432
which means you can
do what you want.

465
00:21:57,515 --> 00:22:01,686
So you get to go wherever,
team up with whoever.

466
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:04,064
Your only mission is to
build up your strength.

467
00:22:04,147 --> 00:22:06,232
Remember, this is a devil
and the Spade Kingdom

468
00:22:06,316 --> 00:22:07,275
we're dealin' with.

469
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:09,235
Train like your life
depends on it.

470
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:11,404
'Cause I'm gonna kill
you if you don't.

471
00:22:11,488 --> 00:22:14,366
Now I usually tell you to do
this in the heat of a battle,

472
00:22:14,449 --> 00:22:17,035
so six months should
be plenty of time.

473
00:22:17,118 --> 00:22:19,996
Push past your limits,
Black Bulls!

474
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,206
[BLACK BULLS]
Right!

475
00:23:56,718 --> 00:23:58,511
[JULIUS]
This isn't just about us.

476
00:23:58,595 --> 00:24:00,013
It's a life-or-death situation

477
00:24:00,096 --> 00:24:02,390
for the Heart and
Diamond Kingdoms, too.

Captain Conference."

480
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:09,397
Let's prepare ourselves
to face that devil
