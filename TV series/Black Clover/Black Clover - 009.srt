intended as a complaint.

It's just...

Given that I can't
control my magic power,

34

should I really be going
on a mission at all?

00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:50,875
the Magic Knights entrance exam.

166
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:54,291
What? Me? Old man,
are you goin' crazy?

167
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:56,416
[SEIHI] Why not?
You've got what it takes.

168
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,541
Yeah, right.

169
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,250
Like a commoner from
the middle of nowhere

170
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,375
even stands a chance.

171
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,625
[SEIHI]
Nothing's set in stone!

172
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:07,000
So, you're a commoner
from way out in the sticks.

173
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:09,041
What's that got to
do with anything?

174
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:12,208
You use your power to
build your own future.

175
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:15,916
I couldn't make that dream
come true, but you can.

176
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,166
Really?

177
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,916
Become a man. It's time.

178
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:25,458
[MAGNA] So, what do the
Magic Knights do, anyway?

179
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:27,750
[SEIHI]
You don't even know that much?

180
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,083
[MAGNA]
Ow!

181
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,625
No question, it's all
thanks to him

182
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:34,833
that I am who I am today.

183
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:37,583
Obviously, I wound up
passing the entrance exam,

184
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:40,458
and when I did, no one
was happier than Seihi.

185
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,000
Sounds like a nice guy.

186
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:43,333
[MAGNA]
You bet.

187
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,250
I know part of the reason
he came to the capital

188
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,083
was to make a fortune
that he could bring back

189
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,416
to help improve his village,

190
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,833
but I have a feeling
he wanted to see me, too.

191
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:56,708
'Course, in the end,
he took me for all I had.

192
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,625
I'll never forget that
he's the one who taught me

193
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:00,416
about bein' a real man.

194
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,791
I wanna be as good a guy
as he is someday.

195
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:05,416
I respect him more than
anyone except for Yam--

196
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:08,375
Huh?

197
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:09,875
What's up? Something wrong?

198
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:11,750
The hell's goin' on?

199
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,708
The whole village...

200
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,833
[NOELLE]
It's covered in mist.

201
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,666
They've got some pretty weird
weather around here, huh?

202
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,166
It's not the weather,
idiot. It's magic.

203
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,416
It is?!

204
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,416
Wow, a magic mist.

205
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,916
Trying to make it
through that would be

206
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,291
about as effective as
walking around blindfolded.

207
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:42,791
We'd lose all sense of direction

208
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:45,458
and blunder around
the place helplessly.

209
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:48,958
[MAGNA]
Magic that can completely cover

210
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:50,958
an entire village.

211
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:54,666
A spell this powerful didn't
come from any villager.

212
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,625
And it sure as hell ain't
Seihi's magic, either.

213
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,666
Something bad happened here.

214
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:00,333
Hey, Asta.

215
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:01,708
Sir!

216
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:04,333
Use your sword and
cut through this mist.

217
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:05,833
[ASTA]
Yes, sir!

218
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:10,083
Aw, you're just
being silly, Magna.

219
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:13,333
You can't cut through
mist with a sword.

220
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:15,166
I'll give ya silly, ya punk!

221
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:18,208
You can cut through magic with
that sword of yours, can't you?

222
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,833
Oh, yeah. That's right!

223
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:23,625
[ASTA yells]

224
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,500
Okay. Push forward.

225
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:31,166
Let's go!

226
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,416
[ASTA]
Got it!

227
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,500
[MAGNA]
To the right!

228
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:35,458
[ASTA]
Roger!

229
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:36,166
[MAGNA]
Hang a left!

230
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,166
[ASTA]
Yes, sir!

231
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,083
You do know this
place pretty well.

232
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,750
That's right. Left!

233
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,250
[ASTA]
Yep!

234
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,083
You feel that?

235
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:50,458
Yeah, I did. It's magic,
and it's strong.

236
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:52,583
[MAGNA]
Straight ahead now! Be careful.

237
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:54,208
[ASTA]
Right!

238
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:55,833
We should be in the square.

239
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:57,000

Kill them.

[VILLAGERS scream]

247
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:46,958
It's three of the Magic Knights.

248
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:50,333
I can't believe they
came to save us!

249
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:51,000
Huh?

00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:52,041
[VILLAGER 9E gasps]

251
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:53,083
[VILLAGER 9D]
Magna, is that you?

252
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:56,083
Hey, Nick. What the
heck's going on?

253
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:58,666

Hey, come on!

00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,791
Stay with me, old man!

257
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,291
No, please.

258
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,916
He can't be gone.

259
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,791
He was just protecting us.

260
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,875
They're here just like
you said, Grandpa.

261
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:22,000
The Magic Knights showed up.

262
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:25,375
We'll be safe now.
Your prayers were heard.

263
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:28,916
[ASTA] To kill someone...
Just like that.

264
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:33,958
Are you the one
who's responsible?

265
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:42,500
[HEATH]
You've thrown off my schedule.

266
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:44,833
I don't appreciate that.

267
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:48,750
Ten seconds from now
everyone here will die.

268
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,416
[MAGNA]
Damn! I don't have enough power.

269
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,500
[MAGNA]
Asta?

270
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:11,083
[ASTA yells]

271
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,833
Think again!

272
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:34,708
Why would you want to
do something so horrible?

273
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,791
Who do you think you are?!

274
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:44,708
[MAGNA] They don't look
like Diamond Kingdom spies

275
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:47,666
or savages come to
shake down the place.

276
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,083
So who the hell are they?

277
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:53,708
I hadn't heard that
any of the Magic Knights

278
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:55,500
were going to be in the area.

279
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:57,791
[GUSTAV] Perhaps they're here
on an unofficial mission?

280
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,750
[DESIRÉ]
Another thing I'd like to know.

281
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,291
How did they manage
to tear their way

282
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:04,375
through the mist and
enter the village?

283
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:06,208
[HEATH]
The Black Bulls.

284
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:08,250
The roughest,
most undisciplined,

285
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:12,416
most heretical of all
the Magic Knight squads.

286
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,291
Dealing with this
riff-raff would be a waste

287
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:17,166
of precious time. Five minutes.

288
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,250
Now, we will dispose of
these useless villagers

289
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:22,125
in a manner befitting
their station,

290
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:23,958
and then we'll find
what we came for.

291
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:25,958
You really think
you can ignore us?

292
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:28,791
Mist Magic: Shroud.
Illusory Mist.

[ASTA yells]

294
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:33,708
If you think we will
allow you to approach

295
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:36,875
Master Heath so easily,
you are a fool.

296
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:38,166
In the mist, be lost.

297
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,166
[ASTA] You're the ones
who need to get lost.

[DESIRÉ gasps]

299
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,583
[HEATH] So that's how he
was able to cut through

300
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:48,916
my Ice Magic earlier. I don't
know what kind of magic it is,

301
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,500
but that large sword of his
can nullify spells.

302
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:56,041
I can't have him
getting too close.

303
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:58,625
I asked you why you tried
to massacre these villagers,

304
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,583
and I want an answer now!

305
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,458
In this kingdom,
there are three regions,

306
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:07,750
divided by inhabitants.

307
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:10,416
The Noble Realm,
where the nobility reside.

308
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,250
The Common Realm,
where the citizenry live.

309
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:15,750
And the Forsaken Realm.

310
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:17,083
Yeah?

311
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:20,500
[HEATH] Saussy Village
is in the Forsaken Realm.

312
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:23,250
Most in this realm
are of inferior stock.

313
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,916
They're capable of performing
only a few meager spells

314
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,500
to help with the drudgery
of their everyday lives.

315
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:30,041
[BOTH gasp]

316
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:33,166
[HEATH] They're much like
beasts that cannot use tools.

317
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:37,458
You asked why I intend to
do away with the villagers.

318
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:40,458
I am merely attempting to
dispose of the useless beasts

319
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,041
that might waste my time

320
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:43,291
"Useless beasts"?

321
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:44,958
[HEATH]
Consider yourself.

322
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:46,416
You have enough magic power

323
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,458
to have joined

your herd of beasts like this?

"slowly but surely."
