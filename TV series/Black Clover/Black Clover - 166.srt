1
00:00:22,554 --> 00:00:27,142
[NARRATOR] Within the clover's
fifth leaf, there lives a devil.

2
00:00:27,225 --> 00:00:29,686
Asta, born unable
to harness mana,

3
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:31,479
was granted the power
of Anti-magic

4
00:00:31,563 --> 00:00:33,273
from his five-leaf grimoire,

5
00:00:33,356 --> 00:00:36,693
giving him the ability
to nullify spells.

6
00:00:36,776 --> 00:00:39,362
Unfortunately, the members
of Spade Kingdom's

7
00:00:39,446 --> 00:00:42,032
Dark Triad also possess
powers from the devils

8
00:00:42,115 --> 00:00:43,867
of the underworld
and used them

9
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,120
to launch an invasion
on the neighboring countries.

10
00:00:47,203 --> 00:00:49,164
Gaining strength from
his belief in himself

11
00:00:49,247 --> 00:00:51,166
and from the support
of his friends,

12
00:00:51,249 --> 00:00:54,627
Asta continues to fight
for the safety of this world.

13
00:01:00,717 --> 00:01:03,470
[ALL]
We're going to take you down!

14
00:01:03,553 --> 00:01:05,638
[LOROPECHIKA]
The fate of existence itself

15
00:01:05,722 --> 00:01:07,223
is in our hands.

16
00:01:07,307 --> 00:01:10,894
[NOELLE]
Valkyrie Armor: Mermaid Form!

17
00:01:10,977 --> 00:01:12,812
[NARRATOR] Noelle and
Loropechika faced off

18
00:01:12,896 --> 00:01:16,232
against Vanica using the
strategy they had prepared.

19
00:01:16,316 --> 00:01:17,734
However...

20
00:01:17,817 --> 00:01:18,818
[laughs]

21
00:01:18,902 --> 00:01:20,320
[VANICA] Are you ready
for the big one?

22
00:01:20,403 --> 00:01:22,155
Here we go!

23
00:01:22,238 --> 00:01:25,033
You get my best! Lucky you!

24
00:01:25,116 --> 00:01:28,036
Here's 70-percent power!

25
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:29,162
Do it, Noelle!

26
00:01:29,245 --> 00:01:31,081
[NOELLE]
We were waiting for this!

27
00:01:31,164 --> 00:01:32,957
Nero!

28
00:01:34,918 --> 00:01:37,003
I'm about to seal away
that devil's power

29
00:01:37,087 --> 00:01:39,839
you seem so proud of!

00:01:39,923 --> 00:01:44,302
[SECRÉ] Mana Method.
Sealing Magic: Eternal Prison!

31
00:01:44,386 --> 00:01:47,514
I won't let Queen Loropechika,
or this world,

32
00:01:47,597 --> 00:01:50,058
be harmed by scum like you!

33
00:01:50,141 --> 00:01:51,810
It worked!

34
00:01:51,893 --> 00:01:53,103
[SECRÉ]
I did it.

35
00:01:53,186 --> 00:01:57,399
I sealed away her magic
and the devil's power!

36
00:01:57,482 --> 00:01:59,776
Now, the Heart Kingdom
should be safe

37
00:01:59,859 --> 00:02:02,904
from Megicula's wrath,
once and for all!

38
00:02:02,987 --> 00:02:05,156
And the queen's curse
should be gone.

39
00:02:07,033 --> 00:02:08,284
[gasps]

40
00:02:08,368 --> 00:02:09,786
What?

41
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:12,288
[MEGICULA laughs]

42
00:02:13,373 --> 00:02:15,667
[MEGICULA]
You're obviously weaker than us,

43
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,420
and yet you produced
some surprising magic.

44
00:02:21,548 --> 00:02:23,550
[MEGICULA] You put up
an interesting fight.

45
00:02:23,633 --> 00:02:25,218
I'll give you that much.

46
00:02:28,221 --> 00:02:29,264
[gasps]

47
00:02:32,225 --> 00:02:33,852
[UNDINE]
This ominous mana.

48
00:02:33,935 --> 00:02:36,438
Oh, no! Loropechika!

49
00:04:19,374 --> 00:04:21,209
What in the world is happening?

50
00:04:21,292 --> 00:04:24,963
[laughs] You shouldn't
have looked away!

51
00:04:26,089 --> 00:04:27,424
[yelps]

52
00:04:27,507 --> 00:04:29,009
[ROBERO laughs]

53
00:04:30,927 --> 00:04:32,262
Oh, no!

54
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:37,100
[ROBERO]
Take this, girlie!

55
00:04:37,183 --> 00:04:39,394
[MIMOSA yelps]

56
00:04:39,477 --> 00:04:42,522
[MIMOSA]
I know what'll stop you!

57
00:04:42,605 --> 00:04:44,024
[ROBERO grunts]

58
00:04:47,736 --> 00:04:49,279
[ROBERO laughs]

59
00:04:55,201 --> 00:04:57,245
[MEGICULA]
You must've thought so carefully

60
00:04:57,328 --> 00:05:00,540
about how to defeat us.

61
00:05:00,623 --> 00:05:03,668
You came terribly close
to containing my power.

62
00:05:06,212 --> 00:05:09,299
[MEGICULA]
Truly splendid, all of you.

63
00:05:12,052 --> 00:05:17,265
Let's play some more.
I haven't had enough yet.

64
00:05:17,349 --> 00:05:21,019
How did we fail?
What went wrong?

65
00:05:21,102 --> 00:05:24,481
Nero's magic should've been
enough to seal you away!

66
00:05:24,564 --> 00:05:27,567
[MEGICULA] Curse-Warding
Magic: Decaying World.

67
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:32,572
It weakens any spell arrays
that are used against me.

68
00:05:32,655 --> 00:05:37,702
And, it was already active
at 70-percent capacity.

69
00:05:37,786 --> 00:05:40,330
Apparently, it can even
weaken the Sealing Magic

70
00:05:40,413 --> 00:05:44,793
of an arcane-stage opponent.
I'm happy I tried that out.

71
00:05:44,876 --> 00:05:46,628
[VANICA]
Slow down, Megicula!

72
00:05:46,711 --> 00:05:48,421
You're totally
getting in the way!

73
00:05:48,505 --> 00:05:52,133
I'm trying to have fun, y'know!

74
00:05:52,217 --> 00:05:56,054
[UNDINE weakly]
Loro... pechika.

75
00:05:58,682 --> 00:05:59,808
[MEGICULA]
This is the first time

76
00:05:59,891 --> 00:06:02,811
I've ever cursed a Water Spirit.

77
00:06:02,894 --> 00:06:06,523
I see. So, that's what happens.

78
00:06:06,606 --> 00:06:11,111
I'm learning so much
from this experiment.

79
00:06:11,194 --> 00:06:13,822
No. Undine.

80
00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:17,909
[UNDINE]
Where are you?

81
00:06:17,992 --> 00:06:18,743
There!

82
00:06:18,827 --> 00:06:20,829
[giggles]

83
00:06:20,912 --> 00:06:24,207
[giggles] You are
just the cutest!

84
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:26,418
[LOROPECHIKA]
It's time to study.

85
00:06:28,545 --> 00:06:30,296
Let's take today off.

86
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,965
What? Can we?

87
00:06:32,048 --> 00:06:33,508
Sure we can!

88
00:06:33,591 --> 00:06:35,510
A little break
never hurt anybody!

89
00:06:35,593 --> 00:06:39,347
All we have to do is come back
extra strong tomorrow!

90
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,393
[LOROPECHIKA]
She was always by my side.

91
00:06:44,853 --> 00:06:47,480
[UNDINE] You're doing
so well, Loropechika.

92
00:06:47,564 --> 00:06:49,441
Really? I'm not so sure.

93
00:06:49,524 --> 00:06:52,485
Am I good enough?

94
00:06:52,569 --> 00:06:56,156
Of course you are!
Believe in your abilities!

95
00:06:56,239 --> 00:06:57,615
[LOROPECHIKA]
She always consoled me

96
00:06:57,699 --> 00:06:59,451
when things were tough.

97
00:07:00,827 --> 00:07:01,995
[LOROPECHIKA]
It's beautiful.

98
00:07:02,078 --> 00:07:06,082
[UNDINE] Yes. This is
our precious kingdom.

99
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:07,751
[LOROPECHIKA]
Tell me, Undine.

100
00:07:07,834 --> 00:07:11,880
Do you think I can
protect this place?

101
00:07:11,963 --> 00:07:14,299
I know you can, Loropechika.

102
00:07:17,218 --> 00:07:19,471
[LOROPECHIKA]
She was always close to me.

103
00:07:19,554 --> 00:07:21,473
Closer than anyone.

104
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:28,563
[LOROPECHIKA]
Undine.

105
00:07:29,564 --> 00:07:32,692
[screams]

106
00:07:32,776 --> 00:07:34,277
[MEGICULA]
Oops, pardon me.

107
00:07:34,361 --> 00:07:38,448
Your curse must have activated
because I moved closer to you.

108
00:07:38,531 --> 00:07:41,201
You're in too much pain to move,

109
00:07:41,284 --> 00:07:45,205
and now your Water Spirit
can't help you. It's all over.

110
00:07:45,288 --> 00:07:48,041
You better not throw in
the towel, Loropechika!

111
00:07:48,124 --> 00:07:49,501
It was just getting good!

112
00:07:49,584 --> 00:07:54,714
Come on, you've got a little
fight left in you, right?

113
00:07:54,798 --> 00:07:56,466
Hang on, Undine.

114
00:07:56,549 --> 00:07:58,134
Don't die!

115
00:08:01,805 --> 00:08:04,641
[VANICA]
I guess that's it for her.

116
00:08:04,724 --> 00:08:07,977
Well, then, you might
as well die, too.

117
00:08:08,061 --> 00:08:10,397
Loropechika.

118
00:08:12,482 --> 00:08:14,025
Hey, you two.

119
00:08:14,109 --> 00:08:15,318
What?

120
00:08:15,402 --> 00:08:17,028
[NOELLE]
It's not over yet.

121
00:08:17,112 --> 00:08:20,532
Because you both still
have to contend with me!

122
00:08:20,615 --> 00:08:23,451
Please. No one cares
about you anymore.

123
00:08:23,535 --> 00:08:27,330
Without Loropechika's magic,
you're not even a threat now!

124
00:08:27,414 --> 00:08:30,667
See? Way too slow.

125
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,918
[NOELLE grunts]

126
00:08:33,211 --> 00:08:34,587
Let me help you!

127
00:08:37,674 --> 00:08:41,052
[ROBERO laughs]
What a naughty girl,

128
00:08:41,136 --> 00:08:43,555
trying to interfere like that.

129
00:08:43,638 --> 00:08:46,266
[ROBERO] Trust me, honey,
you're about to get a serious

130
00:08:46,349 --> 00:08:49,102
tongue-lashing for
what you've done!

131
00:08:50,186 --> 00:08:54,816
[VANICA sighs]
You can't even compete.

132
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:57,444
So boring.

133
00:08:57,527 --> 00:08:59,362
[NOELLE]
Not yet.

134
00:08:59,446 --> 00:09:00,989
Say what you want.

135
00:09:01,072 --> 00:09:03,283
I'm not done!

136
00:09:03,366 --> 00:09:04,784
[VANICA]
This girl.

137
00:09:04,868 --> 00:09:08,621
[NOELLE]
You've hurt so many people!

138
00:09:08,705 --> 00:09:12,334
And we'll never forgive you!

139
00:09:12,417 --> 00:09:14,085
Ever!

140
00:09:18,256 --> 00:09:21,968
Aw, cute! You really
gave it your all

141
00:09:22,052 --> 00:09:24,596
for that last little push,
but it doesn't affect me at all!

142
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:28,183
[NOELLE] I'll protect her,
no matter what!

143
00:09:28,266 --> 00:09:30,018
Point-Blank Sea Dragon's Roar!

[gasps]

146
00:09:49,996 --> 00:09:52,290
[VANICA]
Y'see? What did I tell you?

147
00:09:52,374 --> 00:09:55,710
Those measly attacks
won't do any--

148
00:09:55,794 --> 00:09:56,878
What?

149
00:09:58,797 --> 00:10:00,173
[VANICA]
Wait a sec.

150
00:10:01,508 --> 00:10:04,344
[NOELLE panting]

151
00:10:04,427 --> 00:10:09,265
[VANICA giggles] Hey, brat.
What did you say your name was?

152
00:10:09,349 --> 00:10:12,811
[NOELLE]
Noelle Silva.

153
00:10:12,894 --> 00:10:17,440
I am a royal of the Clover
Kingdom and a Magic Knight,

154
00:10:17,524 --> 00:10:19,859
a Black Bull!

155
00:10:19,943 --> 00:10:21,695
[laughs]

156
00:10:29,411 --> 00:10:34,416
[clanging]

157
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:53,893
[YAMI grunts]

158
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:00,358
[coughs]

159
00:11:00,442 --> 00:11:02,402
[laughs]

160
00:11:02,485 --> 00:11:05,613
So, you managed to
injure me again.

161
00:11:05,697 --> 00:11:08,450
That certainly was
an impressive feat.

162
00:11:08,533 --> 00:11:13,872
However, this magic I'm
using: it's a bit unsightly.

163
00:11:13,955 --> 00:11:15,749
I'm going to show you something

164
00:11:15,832 --> 00:11:20,086
since it's just you
and me, Yami Sukehiro.

165
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:22,589
You're about to witness
the awesome power

166
00:11:22,672 --> 00:11:25,091
bestowed upon the
devil-possessed!

167
00:11:25,175 --> 00:11:26,885
[YAMI]
Sounds good.

168
00:11:26,968 --> 00:11:30,347
I've got somethin'
to show you, too.

169
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:34,851
I call this the power
of an ordinary human!

170
00:11:41,107 --> 00:11:42,484
[FINRAL]
We were keeping watch until

171
00:11:42,567 --> 00:11:45,779
the right moment
to attack Spade.

172
00:11:45,862 --> 00:11:48,573
How did things
turn out like this?

173
00:11:48,656 --> 00:11:51,701
Should I focus on
supporting Yami?

174
00:11:51,785 --> 00:11:55,121
Or should I try and round up
some other Squad Captains?

175
00:11:55,205 --> 00:11:56,748
[FINRAL gasps]

176
00:11:56,831 --> 00:11:58,750
[FINRAL]
No, I can't.

177
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:02,212
If I make a move,
he'll kill me on the spot!

178
00:12:14,641 --> 00:12:19,854
[DANTE] My Devil Power just
increased to 80 percent.

179
00:12:19,938 --> 00:12:23,191
Eighty-percent? Was that
supposed to impress me?

180
00:12:23,274 --> 00:12:26,986
[YAMI] Dammit, where's all
that mana coming from?

181
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:30,365
[YAMI] By the way, your
eyeliner's running, creep!

182
00:12:30,448 --> 00:12:32,242
When possessed by a devil,

183
00:12:32,325 --> 00:12:36,454
one's power is shared with
a resident of the underworld.

184
00:12:36,538 --> 00:12:39,749
By its very nature, that
exchange must take place

185
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,584
between two realms.

186
00:12:41,668 --> 00:12:46,673
And until the door is opened,
we cannot reach 100 percent.

187
00:12:46,756 --> 00:12:48,508
[DANTE] Though, I'm not
sure whether that applies

188
00:12:48,591 --> 00:12:50,927
to the little imp over there.

189
00:12:55,348 --> 00:12:59,644
Now for Gravity Magic.
Gravity Singularity technique.

190
00:12:59,728 --> 00:13:01,980
You'd be no use as a dead man,

191
00:13:02,063 --> 00:13:04,607
but I can rip off
a leg, at least.

192
00:13:15,285 --> 00:13:16,327
[ALL gasp]

193
00:13:16,411 --> 00:13:17,871
[YAMI]
Seriously?

194
00:13:17,954 --> 00:13:19,956
That would've taken a lot
more than my leg!

195
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,000
[DANTE laughs]

196
00:13:25,211 --> 00:13:27,172
[YAMI]
Dark Cloaked...

197
00:13:27,255 --> 00:13:29,257
...Dimension Slash!

198
00:13:31,092 --> 00:13:33,470
[YAMI] Wasn't expecting
him to warp that!

199
00:13:33,553 --> 00:13:34,763
This gravity's way stronger

200
00:13:34,846 --> 00:13:37,223
than what he was using
at the beginning!

201
00:13:37,307 --> 00:13:40,727
If I use Black Moon, they might
cancel each other out.

202
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:42,771
But, as long as he's
generating gravity,

203
00:13:42,854 --> 00:13:45,815
I can't afford to
waste that move.

204
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:47,692
I'll just keep my
Mana Zone condensed

205
00:13:47,776 --> 00:13:50,695
and my senses sharp
until I can get behind him!

206
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,912
[YAMI]
No, wait!

207
00:13:58,995 --> 00:14:00,163
There's no point
in cutting him down

208
00:14:00,246 --> 00:14:01,956
if he's just gonna regenerate!

209
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,417
I need something
powerful and precise!

210
00:14:16,096 --> 00:14:18,306
[YAMI]
I'll focus on one spot.

211
00:14:28,733 --> 00:14:31,194
You were surprisingly
entertaining to fight,

212
00:14:31,277 --> 00:14:33,196
Yami Sukehiro.

213
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,157
I mean, you're just
a human, but... still.

214
00:14:36,241 --> 00:14:37,242
Huh?

215
00:14:37,325 --> 00:14:39,369
--[FINRAL] Yami!
--[VANESSA] Captain, no!

216
00:14:41,955 --> 00:14:44,916
[DANTE]
Now, then.

217
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,126
Who's up next?

218
00:14:46,209 --> 00:14:48,503
[ASTA growls]

219
00:14:50,296 --> 00:14:51,047
[gasps]

220
00:14:51,131 --> 00:14:52,590
[GROUP gasps]

221
00:14:55,552 --> 00:14:58,263
[YAMI]
Right here and now.

222
00:14:58,346 --> 00:15:02,058
I'll push past my limits!

223
00:15:02,142 --> 00:15:04,352
If I let my squad down...

224
00:15:06,771 --> 00:15:10,567
Well, then I'd be a
piss-poor captain, wouldn't I?

225
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:15,864
[YAMI] I'll take that condensed
Mana Zone and condense it more!

226
00:15:15,947 --> 00:15:18,408
Focusing it on one spot!

227
00:15:20,785 --> 00:15:24,873
[laughs] I admit, that's
quite a clever strategy,

228
00:15:24,956 --> 00:15:27,334
but you'll need a lot more
than that, my friend!

229
00:15:27,417 --> 00:15:29,127
[YAMI]
Dark Magic...

230
00:15:34,049 --> 00:15:35,633
...Death Thrust!

231
00:15:38,386 --> 00:15:41,014
[grunts]

232
00:15:41,097 --> 00:15:42,974
[BOTH gasp]

233
00:15:43,058 --> 00:15:46,269
Well, I said "thrust,"
but it was more like a cannon.

234
00:15:46,353 --> 00:15:47,604
[ASTA]
Whoa.

235
00:15:47,687 --> 00:15:50,857
Captain Yami really
is incredible!

236
00:15:52,901 --> 00:15:54,361
Sorry, pal.

237
00:15:54,444 --> 00:15:58,865
I couldn't help it, you had
"target" written all over you.

238
00:15:58,948 --> 00:16:00,492
[DANTE]
Impossible!

239
00:16:00,575 --> 00:16:04,496
There's no human capable
of beating me at my best!

240
00:16:04,579 --> 00:16:05,497
No.

241
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,248
Obviously, I'm wrong.

242
00:16:07,332 --> 00:16:11,836
There is someone, and he just
blew a hole right through me!

243
00:16:16,883 --> 00:16:20,387
[DANTE] That was irritating,
to say the least.

244
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:24,224
But, thank you, Yami Sukehiro.

245
00:16:24,307 --> 00:16:25,058
[gasps]

246
00:16:25,141 --> 00:16:27,769
Is he... regenerating?

247
00:16:27,852 --> 00:16:29,646
How did that not kill him?

248
00:16:29,729 --> 00:16:32,357
[DANTE]
My innate ability is Body Magic,

249
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:36,111
and the devil's power makes me
even better at restoring myself

250
00:16:36,194 --> 00:16:38,321
after a hard hit like that.

251
00:16:38,405 --> 00:16:43,159
It's impossible for me to die,
grow old, or deteriorate!

252
00:16:43,243 --> 00:16:45,161
But, let me be clear.

253
00:16:45,245 --> 00:16:48,623
I detest how ugly
it is when I morph.

254
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:51,751
The sight of it reminds me
that I'm being pushed.

255
00:16:51,835 --> 00:16:56,631
So, I prefer never to use
this magic if I can help it.

256
00:16:59,009 --> 00:17:01,636
This is gettin' way out of hand.

257
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,432
I mean c'mon, are you
even human at this point?

258
00:17:05,515 --> 00:17:09,602
Hideous though it may be,
it's quite gratifying!

259
00:17:09,686 --> 00:17:11,896
[DANTE growls]

260
00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:15,066
[YAMI]
Death Thrust!

261
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:18,194
You've amazed me once again.
You should be proud.

262
00:17:18,278 --> 00:17:22,198
Your instincts and combat
finesse are superior to my own.

263
00:17:22,282 --> 00:17:24,701
It's making me jealous!

264
00:17:24,784 --> 00:17:26,786
But you see, I can't die!

265
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:29,122
Otherwise, you might've
stood a chance.

266
00:17:29,205 --> 00:17:32,709
You may be skilled, but that
means nothing in this fight!

267
00:17:32,792 --> 00:17:35,545
The world is just
so terribly unfair!

268
00:17:35,628 --> 00:17:39,174
Try as you might, there are
still things you can't control!

269
00:17:39,257 --> 00:17:41,634
It's the same for me!

270
00:17:43,386 --> 00:17:46,598
[DANTE] Every once in a while,
be it because of raw talent

271
00:17:46,681 --> 00:17:50,435
or careful training, some foe
manages to miraculously

272
00:17:50,518 --> 00:17:52,771
point their blade at my throat.

273
00:17:52,854 --> 00:17:57,400
In the end, I have no choice
but to decimate them completely!

274
00:17:57,484 --> 00:18:01,112
That, my friend,
is the height of ecstasy!

275
00:18:04,866 --> 00:18:07,118
[DANTE growls]

276
00:18:08,453 --> 00:18:09,829
[grunts]

277
00:18:09,913 --> 00:18:11,498
Be careful!

278
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,752
Be careful, Captain!

279
00:18:15,835 --> 00:18:18,838
[YAMI] I can't get close
enough to land a hit!

280
00:18:18,922 --> 00:18:22,842
[laughing]

281
00:18:22,926 --> 00:18:24,177
[YAMI]
But if I move too far away,

282
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,513
he starts chucking rocks at me!

283
00:18:27,722 --> 00:18:28,765
Damn you!

284
00:18:33,978 --> 00:18:35,689
[DANTE laughs]

285
00:18:42,987 --> 00:18:45,448
[ASTA]
Captain Yami is still fighting.

286
00:18:45,532 --> 00:18:48,743
He pushed past his limits,
and here I am.

287
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:53,206
Stand up! Come on,
stupid body, move!

288
00:18:53,289 --> 00:18:56,251
Please. Please!

289
00:18:59,462 --> 00:19:02,340
[cackling]

290

[YAMI panting]

291
00:19:26,906 --> 00:19:29,784
[ASTA]
Captain Yami.

[ASTA]
No!

295
00:19:46,676 --> 00:19:49,888
[sighs] I'll admit it.

296
00:19:49,971 --> 00:19:52,766
I can't win this
fight on my own.

297
00:19:52,849 --> 00:19:55,435
This guy's creepy and insane!

298
00:19:55,518 --> 00:19:59,022
Plus he can't die and he
never runs out of mana!

299
00:19:59,105 --> 00:20:04,402
[YAMI] Hey! I'm gonna
need backup over here.

300
00:20:04,486 --> 00:20:07,322
Asta!

301
00:20:07,405 --> 00:20:09,282
You got a death wish, boy?

302
00:20:09,366 --> 00:20:11,910
Hey, kid! Were you watching?

303
00:20:11,993 --> 00:20:13,328
Look alive, kid.

304
00:20:13,411 --> 00:20:15,997
Why're you just standin' there
like some kinda chicken?

305
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:18,375
I wouldn't give you more
than you could handle.

306
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:21,336
Do something.
Fight him your way, kid.

307
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:24,714
[laughs] You fell down!

308
00:20:25,965 --> 00:20:28,385
[YAMI] You're not worried
about me, are you, kid?

309
00:20:28,468 --> 00:20:29,678
'Cause I'll tell you right now,

310
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:32,305
it's about a billion years
too early for that.

311
00:20:43,608 --> 00:20:44,818
Ready!

312
00:20:47,028 --> 00:20:49,572
You're both going to
challenge me at once--

313
00:20:49,656 --> 00:20:51,950
how absolutely delightful!

314
00:20:52,033 --> 00:20:55,954
Entertain me!
I'm starting to get bored.

315

[panting]

316
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:03,420
[YAMI]
You'd better keep up, Asta.

We've got this, Captain Yami!

00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,932
[laughing]

320
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,861
[FULL CAST]
Clover Clips!

321
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:56,032
[ROBERO]
I Wanna Lick.

322
00:22:57,659 --> 00:23:00,787
Come on. I wanna lick!

323
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:03,456
And you're looking
awfully lickable!

324
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:06,126
Um. That doesn't work for me.

325
00:23:06,209 --> 00:23:07,711
Here! Maybe you'd like this!

326
00:23:07,794 --> 00:23:11,047
[laughs] This is so
yummy and sweet.

327
00:23:11,131 --> 00:23:14,592
A perfect candidate
for a lick, if you ask me!

328
00:23:14,676 --> 00:23:16,720
Then I bet this'll
be even better!

329
00:23:16,803 --> 00:23:20,849
[laughs] This is sweet too, but
the rich flavor and cold texture

330
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:24,310
put it very high on
the lickability scale!

331
00:23:24,394 --> 00:23:25,812
Now that you've
got what you want,

332
00:23:25,895 --> 00:23:28,106
we can put an end to all this
pointless fighting, right?

333
00:23:28,189 --> 00:23:31,067
Actually, there's still one
more thing that's missing.

334
00:23:31,151 --> 00:23:33,319
[NOELLE]
Leave this part to me, Mimosa.

335
00:23:34,821 --> 00:23:37,615
[ROBERO groans]

336
00:23:39,242 --> 00:23:41,995
Is this what you had in mind,
you stupid sicko?

337
00:23:42,078 --> 00:23:44,122
[ROBERO]
It's perfect! Unless, of course,

338
00:23:44,205 --> 00:23:48,793
you're willing to step
on me even harder!

339
00:23:48,877 --> 00:23:51,755
I figured that was it.
Thank you, Noelle.

340
00:23:51,838 --> 00:23:54,424
Looks like you're a lot
braver than I am.

341
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,929
[YAMI] Ready, Asta?
It's time for the counterattack!

342
00:24:00,013 --> 00:24:01,765
[ASTA]
I'm on it, Captain Yami!

343
00:24:01,848 --> 00:24:04,267
I'm gonna push past my limits
and destroy this freak

344
00:24:04,351 --> 00:24:06,436
once and for all!

345
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:10,148
