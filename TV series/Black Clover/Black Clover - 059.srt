Threatened by a ruthless demon,

humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

[NARRATOR] Recognizing
the severity of the threat,

33
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:48,416
the Queen of Witches restored
Asta's arms in exchange

34

their common foe.

even stronger than before.

And so, he began his battle
against the vengeful Fana.

I'll make sure
this is the last time.

tears mana to pieces!

Oh, man, that was scary!
But it's really awesome, too!

downright silly
for being scared.

So not only
has it gotten bigger,

00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:29,333
now it's using a new power, too?

In that case...

out my special move!

She's tricky!

It looks like she used her

to generate a mana forcefield.

Hmm.

322
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:53,208
[BOTH] Maybe it wouldn't
be if we weren't here!

323
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:56,125
[VANESSA] You're always coming
up with the craziest ideas.

324
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:58,208
Let us give you a hand
with that new move!

325
00:19:58,291 --> 00:19:59,541
[ASTA yelps]

326
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,541
[VANESSA] It's like
I told you before, Asta:

327
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:07,750
Friends help you overcome a fate
you can't defeat on your own!

328
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:10,666
We're here for you.

329
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,416
Your special move is
gonna be incredible!

330
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:16,416
Here we go!

331
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,083
[ASTA growls]

332
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:24,291
It's too late!

333
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:36,333
You're not killing
anybody, you hear me?

334
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:38,166
[gasps]

335
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:39,541
[gasping]

336
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:44,375
[ASTA]
Bull Thrust!

337
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:55,875
[GROUP]
We won!

338
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:57,708
All right!

339
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:00,208
My special move totally
kicked her butt!

340
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:08,541
[FANA]
It can't... be.

341
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,958
I failed...

342
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:56,458
[FULL CAST]
Clover Clips!

343
00:22:58,833 --> 00:23:00,375
[ASTA]
"Again and Again."

344
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:03,791
[ASTA] Bring it on,
again and again and again

345
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:05,500
and again and again!

346
00:23:05,583 --> 00:23:08,000
I'll just keep fighting
you off, every single time.

347
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:09,958
Again and again and again!

348
00:23:10,041 --> 00:23:11,750
Try me!

349
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:19,250
[ASTA]
Om-nom-nom-nom!

350
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:21,125
Yeah bring it on,
fishcake after fishcake

351
00:23:21,208 --> 00:23:22,791
after fishcake!

352
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:26,250
I'll just keep eating you up,
every single time try me!

353
00:23:31,958 --> 00:23:34,958
Yeah! Bring it on, soybean
after fermented soybean!

354
00:23:35,041 --> 00:23:37,000
I'll just keep slicing you up
again and again,

355
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:38,791
fermented soybeans!

356
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:42,083
[wails]
My swords are covered in it now!

357
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:45,125
Wouldn't wanna get
stabbed by those things.

358
00:23:46,166 --> 00:23:47,500
[VANESSA]
You did it, kiddo!

359
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:49,375
You defeated Salamander!

360
00:23:49,458 --> 00:23:52,875
Black Clover, page 60:
"Defectors' Atonement."

361
00:23:52,958 --> 00:23:54,166
No, Asta.

362
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,791
It has nothing to do
with toning your muscles.

363
00:23:56,875 --> 00:24:00,416
The word is "atonement,"
as in paying for your sins.
