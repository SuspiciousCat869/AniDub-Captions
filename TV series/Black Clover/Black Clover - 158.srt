[LOROPECHIKA]
Seems everything went well.

319
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:21,489
We just received word
that they were successful

320
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:23,324
in taking control of the base.

321
00:17:23,408 --> 00:17:26,119
And they did even better
than I could've expected.

322
00:17:26,202 --> 00:17:27,912
That was impressive!

323
00:17:27,996 --> 00:17:30,081
[GAJA]
True, but still.

324
00:17:30,165 --> 00:17:32,500
Yes, I know.

325
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:35,045
The real battle
has yet to begin.

326

[MAN 158C]
Is the fighting over?

327
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,636
Can we leave now?

328
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,221
--Are the soldiers all gone?
--[MAN 158D] We're saved.

329
00:17:45,305 --> 00:17:48,725
What about our village?
What will you do to it?

330
00:17:48,808 --> 00:17:51,353
Huh? What do you mean "do"?

331
00:17:51,436 --> 00:17:54,356
I mean, the ones who
just seized control,

332
00:17:54,439 --> 00:17:56,524
they're all with
you, aren't they?

333
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:59,486
And you came here from
the Clover Kingdom.

334
00:17:59,569 --> 00:18:02,697
We have to obey the strong
if we want to survive.

335
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:06,242
That's the way
things work, isn't it?

336
00:18:06,326 --> 00:18:08,286
Oh, we won't do anything.

337
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:11,831
That's your village.
Do what you want with it!

Our friend Finral,
he's gonna make sure

340
00:18:15,043 --> 00:18:17,504
everyone gets back
safely. So hang tight!

341
00:18:17,587 --> 00:18:19,005
Wow, really?

Thank goodness!

344
00:18:22,717 --> 00:18:24,511
We're so grateful, sir!

345
00:18:24,594 --> 00:18:26,388
Yeah, thanks for being so nice!

346
00:18:26,471 --> 00:18:28,640
No problem! We just
wanna stop the devil

347
00:18:28,723 --> 00:18:30,600
that's hiding in
the Spade Kingdom!

348
00:18:30,684 --> 00:18:31,851
The devil?

349
00:18:31,935 --> 00:18:36,648
Uh, well, you see,
as it stands right now...

350
00:18:36,731 --> 00:18:40,110
Our nation is governed
by the Dark Triad.

351
00:18:40,193 --> 00:18:42,821
And they've bestowed power
upon another group below them

352
00:18:42,904 --> 00:18:45,031
called the Dark Disciples.

353
00:18:47,242 --> 00:18:50,537
Believe me, sir,
they're extremely strong.

354
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:54,040
Rumor has it, the Dark Triad
are every bit as fearsome

355
00:18:54,124 --> 00:18:56,209
as devils themselves.

356
00:18:56,292 --> 00:18:59,212
Oh, man. That sounds bad.

357
00:19:08,138 --> 00:19:10,640
[DANTE] It appears as though
you've gotten quite comfortable

358
00:19:10,724 --> 00:19:12,934
with wielding the devil's power,

359
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:13,977
Zenon.

360
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:16,730
Yes. Mostly.

361
00:19:16,813 --> 00:19:20,066
We've received reports that
our outlying base has fallen.

362
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:22,569
The same happened to Candelo,
the mobile fortress

363
00:19:22,652 --> 00:19:24,988
we sent toward
the Heart Kingdom.

364
00:19:25,071 --> 00:19:27,240
Let's not worry about that.

365
00:19:27,323 --> 00:19:31,578
Our soldiers need something
to keep them occupied, anyway.

366
00:19:31,661 --> 00:19:33,872
Dante. What's the deal?

367
00:19:33,955 --> 00:19:36,916
Why does Zenon get all the fun?

368
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,836
You let him go to Diamond
all by himself, too!

369
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,964
Because I was better suited
for that assignment.

370
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:45,300
So? What's your point?

371
00:19:45,383 --> 00:19:48,595
You only used about 40 percent
of your power that time!

372
00:19:48,678 --> 00:19:52,599
I'm capable of the exact same
thing, thank you very much.

373
00:19:52,682 --> 00:19:54,017
Come on, guys.

374
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:57,062
When are you gonna let me
do something interesting?

375
00:19:57,145 --> 00:20:00,607
[DANTE chuckles] You have
improved quite a bit, Vanica.

376
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:03,860
That's right!
So let me prove it!

377
00:20:03,943 --> 00:20:05,779
Yes. You are ready,

378
00:20:05,862 --> 00:20:07,572
and it's time to make our move.

379
00:20:07,655 --> 00:20:10,325
[laughs] Yay, finally!

380
00:20:10,408 --> 00:20:11,910
I get to eat my treat.

381
00:20:11,993 --> 00:20:16,331
I've been saving that thing
for so long, but no more.

382
00:20:16,414 --> 00:20:19,376
So, why did we wait
for half a year?

383
00:20:19,459 --> 00:20:22,837
We needed to be fully prepared
for the events to come.

384
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:27,092
After all, what would be the fun
in letting the game end swiftly?

385
00:20:27,175 --> 00:20:30,261
We're going to wipe out
this entire world.

386
00:20:30,345 --> 00:20:35,266
All sense of order, mankind's
successes, nature's beauty.

387
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:38,186
Everything will be meaningless.

388
00:20:38,269 --> 00:20:42,816
The keys we need to open the
door are well within our reach.

389
00:20:42,899 --> 00:20:45,276
You mean the
arcane-stage mages.

390
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,697
There is no possible
salvation for them now.

391
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,741
At this point,
we hold existence itself

392
00:20:51,825 --> 00:20:54,577
in the palms of our hands.

393
00:21:02,252 --> 00:21:05,380
Asta's off in another
land doing his best.

394
00:21:05,463 --> 00:21:06,756
What'd he say?

395
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:11,261
"I think the big battle's
going to start soon"?

Yeah, that's great and all,
but I feel like

I might've grown
a little bit, too,

if you look at me super close!

406
00:23:15,176 --> 00:23:16,761
We're pretty much
the same height now,

407
00:23:16,845 --> 00:23:19,264
so there's no reason to
brag about stuff like that!

408
00:23:19,347 --> 00:23:21,182
Come on, that's ridiculous.

make him happy.
