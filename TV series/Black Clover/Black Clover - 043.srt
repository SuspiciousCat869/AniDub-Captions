1
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:15,625
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:18,583
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:24,625
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:27,250
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:35,750
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:39,916
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,000
[NARRATOR] The Black Bulls
have finally made it

8
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:46,166
to the Underwater Temple.
However, when they arrived...

9
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,666
You came to my temple to seek
the magic stone, didn't you?

10
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,541
If you want it,
you'll have to play

11
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:53,250
a game with me first.

12
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:55,625
[NARRATOR] A mysterious
old man, the high priest,

13
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:58,625
and his nine Temple Mages
were waiting for them.

14
00:00:58,708 --> 00:01:00,583
The high priest separated
the Black Bulls,

15
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:02,958
telling them they must fight
the mages, nine-on-nine,

16
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:05,375
if they want to leave
with the magic stone.

17
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:07,541
[GIFSO] The team that wipes
out all of their opponents

18
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:10,208
or the one with the most
players left standing

19
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:12,416
when the game concludes
will be the winner.

20
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,458
Oh, yeah! I'm so there!

21
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:17,000
This is gonna be
a total bloodbath!

22
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:18,375
Hold on.

23
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:20,708
Did he say it was going
to be a nine-on-nine battle?

24
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:22,041
But there should be ten of us.

25
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:23,750
All right, I got it!

26
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:26,666
Now, let's go! I'm ready!

27
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,083
[OCTOPUS MAGE]
How interesting.

28
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:30,458
I'm not sensing so much
as a scrap of magic

29
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:31,541
coming from you.

30
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:34,666
Too bad. Looks like I got a dud.

31
00:01:36,541 --> 00:01:38,416
[ASTA]
You think I'm a dud, huh?

32
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,750
Just try me and find out.

33
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:15,708
[GIFSO laughs]

34
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:18,041
Perfect! Now I can
sit back, relax,

35
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:19,791
and watch how the game unfolds.

36
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:22,666
Got a nice little spread
laid out and everything.

37
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:25,250
Listen up, you whacko.

38
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,458
There's no way I'm gonna
sit on the sidelines.

39
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,041
Let me play or I won't
be a happy camper.

40
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:33,500
[laughs] I'm afraid
that won't work.

41
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:35,000
You're too strong.

42
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:37,458
I've been looking forward
to this, and so have

43
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:40,833
all the good people who
are watching from outside.

44
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:44,958
Can't have the fun end
too quickly, now can we?

45
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:46,708
Well, hell, looks like
you've got a good eye

46
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:48,541
for fightin' skill, old man.

47
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,458
This geezer knows
a thing or two!

48
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:53,000
[BOTH laugh]

49
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:55,000
[GIFSO] Oh, looks like
some of the competitors

50
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:56,458
have crossed paths.

51
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:59,500
[YAMI] Those idiots better
not lose, or I'll kill 'em.

52
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,250
I'm so cold.

53
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,750
I'm gonna make that
crazy old bastard pay.

54
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:09,208
[SEAHORSE MAGE laughs]
That's priceless!

55
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,500
Fire magic in an
underwater temple.

56
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:14,083
This should be
very entertaining.

57
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:17,250
[MORAY MAGE] Hm. So small
and fragile looking.

58
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:21,458
I'll almost feel ashamed
when I tear you apart.

59
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:23,791
Ooh, are you the
one I get to fight?

60
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:26,791
[PUFFER MAGE]
I've heard of you people.

61
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,541
You're the Black Bulls.

62
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:31,833
They say you're the weakest
of all the Magic Knight squads.

63
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,083
[PUFFER MAGE laughs]

64
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:36,625
Marie is waiting. Let's
just get this over with.

65
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:39,625
[OCTOPUS MAGE]
So you know, waving around

66
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:42,541
that rusty old sword
is a waste of your time.

67
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,375
I can dodge any attack
you throw at me

68
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:47,125
with my Mollusk Magic.

69
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:48,416
Oh, yeah?

70
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:53,500
[GIFSO laughs] My toes are
practically tingling!

71
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:55,333
Out of curiosity, Captain,

72
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:57,708
how are those mages
of yours ranked?

73
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:59,958
They're all still
at the junior level.

74
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:02,666
I'm surprised ya know about
ranks, livin' down here.

75
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:06,666
[laughs] All my Temple Mages
are more powerful

76
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,583
than intermediate-class
Magic Knights,

77
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:11,041
and they're out there
fighting a bunch of juniors?

78
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:14,500
Your poor shmucks don't stand
a chance in this battle!

79
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,333
[YAMI]
Wow. That's bad.

80
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:19,500
Guess we're in trouble.

81
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:21,875
Unless those poor shmucks
are actually stronger

82
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:23,958
than their ranks suggest.

83
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:26,541
They're losing?
That's impossible!

84
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:30,458
Heh. It's gonna take more
than a few drops of water

85
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:31,791
to scare me off.

86
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:34,250
I say we turn this little
battle into a fish fry!

87
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,791
I guess that musta been
one of their weaker guys.

88
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:39,500
How boring. Wonder where
the tough ones are.

89
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:40,750
There, now that's done,

90
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:42,875
we can move on to much
more important things.

91
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:45,166
Like getting back to Marie.

92
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:49,000
[OCTOPUS MAGE grunting]
I don't understand.

93
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:51,083
My Mollusk Magic should
be able to deflect

94
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,416
any kind of physical attack.

95
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,291
That stuff's not
gonna work on me.

96
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:57,416
This is an anti-magic sword.

97
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,375
[ASTA]
Who's up next?

98
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:01,875
[ASTA yells]

99
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:07,541
[laughs] Yeah! Beat the
crap outta those fish!

100
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:11,541
[GIFSO growls] Idiots! Letting
them get the drop on you!

101
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:13,416
Hey, how 'bout we
bet on which team's

102
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,166
gonna win this game of yours?

103
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,166
I'm puttin' 10,000 yul
on the Bulls.

104
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,708
Please! This is
just the beginning.

105
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:22,416
The mages who're
left won't go down

106
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,958
as easily as those others.

107
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:26,708
In fact, my three great
mages rival senior-ranked

108
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:29,166
Magic Knights in terms of power.

109
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:34,083
[FINRAL]
Don't see me.

110
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:38,583
Phew. That was a close one.

111
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:41,958
I have no desire to fight
someone that scary looking.

112
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:43,375
I've been trying
to get back to where

113
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:46,333
this all started, but I can't
seem to for some reason.

114
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:47,958
Looks like for now
I can only use magic

115
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,541
to get to places that I can see.

116
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:53,333
[GIFSO] Oh, yes, there's one
thing I neglected to tell you.

117
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:56,541
Until the game is over,
you won't be able to leave.

118
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,750
[FINRAL] Hey, are you
watching me, old man?

119
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:02,375
[YAMI] Finral! Quit hidin'
and fight already. You wuss!

120
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:04,166
[FINRAL] Wait! You're
watching, too, Yami?

121
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,708
But how? Don't tell me
you're with the crazy priest!

122
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:07,833
[YAMI]
We're havin' a feast,

123
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:09,791
with your fights as
the entertainment.

124
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:11,583
[FINRAL]
What?! If you're with him,

125
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,375
can't you get him
to call off this game?

126
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:14,875
It's brutal!

127
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:17,250
[YAMI] Well, yeah. The brutal
part's what makes it fun.

128
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:18,833
[GIFSO]
I couldn't've said it better.

129
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,500
[FINRAL]
Great, they're buddies now?

130
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:21,708
You know,

131
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:23,083
this'll be a lot less
fun if your knights

132
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:24,583
are just gonna run away.

133
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,291
[YAMI]
Yeah. We gotta make 'im fight.

134
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:29,208
Well, it's time for
some nuisance magic.

135
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:32,958
Game Magic: Monster Toy!

00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:41,416
[FINRAL screaming]

139
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,916
[laughs] Look at 'im go!

140
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,166
I should give him a few
more to play with.

141
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,333
Listen up, geezer.

142
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:49,583
That didn't look deadly enough.

143
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,416
Can you whip up somethin'
more like this?

144
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,875
[GIFSO] Just to clarify--you're
on their side, aren't you?

145
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:56,750
Nice drawing, though!

146
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:59,125
Now, let's see how the
rest of those little idiots

147
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:00,583
are holdin' up.

148

and scuttled off somewhere.

Gonna kill the moron later.

150
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:08,125
Oh, looks like
Charmy's fighting.

151
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:10,500
[panting]

152
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:13,458
Wow. I've never seen
anything like this before.

153
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:18,541
Yes, the Underwater Temple's
denizens are truly yummy!

154
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,500
So awesome!

155
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:24,958
If I'd known the seafood
was so magnificent here,

156
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:26,916
I'd've come to visit
a long time ago,

157
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,083
strong magic region or not.

158
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:31,833
Ah, if only my
prince of provisions

159
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:35,000
were here to savor
this feast with me.

160
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:36,708
That's it!

161
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:40,458
I hereby claim this ecosystem
in the name of Charmy!

162
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:45,708
And I'm gonna keep
eatin' till it's empty!

163
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:49,333
[CHARMY laughs]

164
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:53,291
What, uh, is she doing, exactly?

165
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:55,750
Oh, yeah! Here we go!

166
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:58,375
--And it's all for me. Yay!
--[DOLPHIN MAGE] Found you!

167
00:08:58,458 --> 00:08:59,708
Huh?

168
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:02,250
[DOLPHIN MAGE] Aw! Look at
what a cutie you are.

169
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,375
Too bad I'm gonna
have to squash you.

170
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:06,500
[CHARMY]
Heh. Is that right?

171
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,625
Well, right now, I'm full
of mana from all those

172
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:10,833
tasty little sea
creatures I ate.

173
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:12,583
You want to see if you'll
manage any better

174
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:14,750
against my teeth than they did?

175
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,791
Then let's dance!

176
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:18,583
[yells]

177
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:22,083
[DOLPHIN MAGE giggles]
Song Magic: Mother Lullaby.

00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:27,125
[singing]

179
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:34,416
Wow. I feel really
good all of a sudden.

180
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:39,583
[CHARMY]
No, wait. I can eat more.

181
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,208
[DOLPHIN MAGE]
That's one down!

182
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,875
[laughs] Oh, I should've
mentioned that sleeping

183
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:47,208
counts as a knock out.

184
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:48,666
Well, what do you think,
now that you've seen

185
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,750
one of my great mages in action?

186
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:54,125
When we get back, she's on
short rations for a week.

187
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:55,291
[DOLPHIN MAGE]
That was fun.

188
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,875
Maybe I'll run into
my new friends next.

189
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,250
Nice.

190
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,166
My clothes are finally dry
after that dousing earlier.

191
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,541
I wonder who my next
victim's gonna be.

192
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:06,875
--[MAGNA] Eh?
--[LUCK] Uh--

193
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:08,583
Well, it looks like
you're still alive

194
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:09,833
and kickin', Lightning Boy.

195
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:12,416
Yep! And I knocked
out a temple mage.

196
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,208
I headed this way 'cause
I thought I was picking up

197
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:16,083
on something pretty strong.

198
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,750
And oh, goodie, it looks
like I was right.

199
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:23,083
Hell, yeah.

200
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:25,250
Now we just gotta decide
which one of us is gonna--

201
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,166
Hey, Luck, no fair!
Come back here, ya jerk!

202
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:31,583
[laughs] First come,
first served, sorry!

Lightning Magic:
Thunderbolt Destruction!

[GIO] Water Creation Magic:
Sea God's Shield.

205
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:49,708
[LUCK]
He's tough!

206
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:52,041
Lightning and Water should
be a good match, too!

207
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:56,083
[GIO] Well, well, aren't you a
spunky little fella. He, he, he.

208
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:57,916

Gotcha, Slimy!

212
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:13,375
[ASTA]
That ki. Someone's there.

213

[MONSTER TOYS groan]

214
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:18,791
[TEMPLE MAGE 42A]
Aw, come on, Grandpa.

215
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:21,833
Can't you save the nuisance
spells for the other team?

216
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:24,916
Well, whatever. It was
a good warm-up, I guess.

217
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:29,333
[ASTA] He beat that
huge thing? Who is he?

218
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:31,833
[TEMPLE MAGE 42A]
Huh? Oh, hey there.

219
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:33,750
You're Asta, aren'tcha?

220
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,916
Uh, yeah, that's me.

221
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,416
[TEMPLE MAGE 42A]
I've heard about you!

222
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,416
You wield a strange sword
that cancels out magic.

223
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,000
Sure, that's right.

224
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:43,750
Wait, heard what, from who?

225
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:47,333
[TEMPLE MAGE 42A laughs] Never
mind that. Check out this dance.

226
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,291
[ASTA] But, we're
supposed to be fighting.

227
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:06,041
[ASTA] Still, that's
a pretty awesome dance!

228
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,750
[TEMPLE MAGE 42A] How do you
think it'd go over on land?

229
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:10,291
They would love it!

230
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:11,500
[KIATO]
I'm Kiato!

231
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:13,666
My dream is to captivate
the entire kingdom

232
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,291
with my dancing!

233
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,958
[ASTA] Now he's talking
about his dreams?

234
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:20,583
[KIATO] Except, while we
Underwater Temple folk,

235
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:22,958
can go to the kingdom's
beaches if we want,

236
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:26,583
we're not allowed to visit
any of the cities.

237
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,416
But that could change soon,

238
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,708
because, if I win this
fight, then Grandpa--

239
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,291
Oh yeah, the high priest is
my grandfather, by the way.

240
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:37,291
Anyhow, he said he'll use his
authority to let me go ashore.

241
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:38,458
Yes!

242
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:41,583
I'm going to make it big
as a star dancer!

243
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:43,791
[ASTA]
That's a huge dream, all right.

244
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:45,208
Hey. Wait.

245
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:48,166
Where have I heard something
like that before?

246
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,083
[KIATO]
So, I must apologize

247
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:53,708
But for the sake of my dream,
you must lose this fight!

248
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,083
[ASTA]
So fast!

249
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:03,750
[ASTA] Yeah, well, you're not
the only one with a dream.

250
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:04,791
[KIATO]
Huh?

251
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:06,166
That's right.

252
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:09,041
I wanna become the strongest
mage--the Wizard King.

253
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:11,416
The protector of the kingdom!

254
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,833
So, sorry.

255
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:17,666
But for the sake of my dream,
I'm gonna take you down!

256
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,083
[KIATO]
All right!

257
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,791
We'll both put our dreams
on the line and fight

258
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:24,708
without holding anything back!

259
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:27,125
[ASTA] I wouldn't have
it any other way!

260
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:29,666
[NOELLE]
Great.

261
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,333
What am I supposed to do?

262
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:33,458
How can I fight when I
haven't learned a single

263
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:35,708
proper attack spell yet?

264

[gasps]

265

[DOLPHIN MAGE]
Awesome! I finally found you!

266
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:44,000
[NOELLE]
Oh, no! A Temple Mage!

267
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:46,333
Well, I suppose it's
only fair to warn you

268
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:48,708
I am royalty.
Fight at your own risk.

269
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:50,333
Now's your last chance to run.

270
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:53,916
[DOLPHIN MAGE laughs] How cute!
I'm so glad you came, Noelle!

271
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,708
Uh, wait a sec.
How do you know my name?

272
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:57,875
[DOLPHIN MAGE]
Oh, silly me!

273
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:00,083
I forgot about the
whole mask thing.

274
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:03,916
[gasps]

275
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,625
[NOELLE]
Kahono!

276
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:10,208
I've been waiting
for you! Hiyah!

277
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,083
You live here?

278
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:22,791
You're one of the Temple Mages
we're supposed to fight.

279
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,416
Then why were you
so eager to help me

280
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,458
learn how to control my magic?

281
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:27,833
Yeah, about that.

282
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:29,583
I wasn't just practicing
up by the beach,

283
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:31,083
I was also looking for people

284
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:33,083
who wanted to come
down and visit us.

285
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:34,458
When we have visitors, Grandpa--

286
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:38,208
um, the high priest--always
wants to play this game.

287
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:40,458
And if I win, then I
get to go ashore.

288
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:43,041
Which means that I can
finally become an idol!

289
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:44,333
That's why?

290
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,916
So, then, you were
using me the whole time!

291
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,833
What? No, I wasn't.

292
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,208
When I saw how hard
you were trying,

293
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:52,958
I really did wanna help you.

294
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:55,916
And I totally still wanna
be your friend, too.

295
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,041
But...

296
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:58,833
Now we're facing off
against each other

297
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:01,916
in this game, and we hafta
fight fair and square!

298
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,125
But why?

299
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:05,250
You just said we were
friends, didn't you?

300
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:06,708
Yep!

301
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:08,375
But real friends can fight
for what's most important

302
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:10,000
to them and still
be able to laugh

303
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:12,125
with each other afterwards.
