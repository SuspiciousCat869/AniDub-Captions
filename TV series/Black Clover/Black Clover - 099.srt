1
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,515
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:25,598 --> 00:00:28,601
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:32,105 --> 00:00:34,399
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:34,482 --> 00:00:37,152
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:43,491 --> 00:00:45,493
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:45,577 --> 00:00:49,873
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:53,918
[NARRATOR] The royal capital
was thrown into chaos

8
00:00:54,002 --> 00:00:55,587
by marauding elves
who had possessed

9
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,797
the bodies of Magic Knights.

10
00:00:57,881 --> 00:00:59,799
Leopold and the
Crimson Lion Kings

11
00:00:59,883 --> 00:01:02,510
found themselves battling
a formidable elven foe

12
00:01:02,594 --> 00:01:05,680
who had taken control of
their Vice-Captain, Randall.

13
00:01:05,764 --> 00:01:06,848
Just then...

14
00:01:16,107 --> 00:01:18,568
[FUEGOLEON]
From now on,

15
00:01:18,651 --> 00:01:21,905
I won't allow anyone
to stand in my way!

16
00:01:21,988 --> 00:01:23,823
Though I may have lost my arm...

17
00:01:23,907 --> 00:01:26,159
Though flames may
scorch my body...

18
00:01:26,242 --> 00:01:30,288
As long as there are
people waiting for me...

19
00:01:30,372 --> 00:01:32,582
...the captain of the
Crimson Lion Kings,

20
00:01:32,665 --> 00:01:35,460
Fuegoleon Vermillion,
will press on!

21
00:01:44,427 --> 00:01:46,930
You've fought well,
Leo. I'm proud.

22
00:01:47,013 --> 00:01:49,182
I can't believe you're here!

23
00:01:49,265 --> 00:01:51,935
[FUEGOLEON] As head of
the Crimson Lion Kings,

24
00:01:52,018 --> 00:01:54,187
and as your older brother,

25
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:57,774
I will be bested no longer!

26
00:01:57,857 --> 00:02:00,110
[NARRATOR] At long last,
Fuegoleon had awoken

27
00:02:00,193 --> 00:02:02,028
from his slumber with the mighty

28
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:05,156
Fire Spirit Salamander
at his side!

29
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:09,411
Meanwhile, at the Eye of the
Midnight Sun's hideout...

30
00:02:09,494 --> 00:02:10,537
[gasps]

31
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,913
[ASTA yelps]

00:02:11,996 --> 00:02:13,373
[ASTA, ZORA scream]

33
00:02:13,456 --> 00:02:16,626
[MEREOLEONA]
Run along home now, children.

34
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,003
But, Captain--!

35
00:02:18,086 --> 00:02:20,088
[NARRATOR] Mereoleona
Vermillion prepared to fight

36
00:02:20,171 --> 00:02:22,924
Rhya and his underlings
on her own.

37
00:03:59,437 --> 00:04:02,899
Ah. So you wanna stay
here and slow us down

38
00:04:02,982 --> 00:04:05,568
so they can run back with their
tails between their legs.

39
00:04:05,652 --> 00:04:08,863
You seem like a benevolent
leader, Madam Royal.

40
00:04:13,576 --> 00:04:17,122
[MEREOLEONA] Fool. You don't
understand a thing, do you?

41
00:04:17,205 --> 00:04:17,997
[RHYA]
Hm?

42
00:04:18,081 --> 00:04:19,457
I sent those novices home

43
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,501
because they were
getting in my way.

44
00:04:21,584 --> 00:04:24,754
Slow you down?
Don't make me laugh.

45
00:04:24,838 --> 00:04:25,839
I wanted the chance

46
00:04:25,922 --> 00:04:28,633
to obliterate all
of you personally!

47
00:04:32,929 --> 00:04:35,640
[RHYA]
You want to obliterate us, huh?

48
00:04:35,724 --> 00:04:38,393
That's the best joke
I've ever heard.

49
00:04:38,476 --> 00:04:39,644
You should be able to understand

50
00:04:39,728 --> 00:04:43,356
the massive gap in our
fighting potential.

51
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,816
Sorry, Miss High-and-Mighty,

52
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:47,861
the Anti-magic kid's ours,
whether you like it or not.

53
00:04:47,944 --> 00:04:50,071
Those swords and
grimoire of his--

54
00:04:50,155 --> 00:04:52,782
every bit of it is property
of the real Licht.

55
00:04:52,866 --> 00:04:54,159
I've been hearing an awful lot

56
00:04:54,242 --> 00:04:57,620
of big talk from you.
Time for action!

57
00:04:59,622 --> 00:05:00,915
[MEREOLEONA]
Mana Zone:

58
00:05:00,999 --> 00:05:04,753
Calidos Brachium, Barrage!

59
00:05:06,254 --> 00:05:08,089
[MEREOLEONA]
If it's the rookie you want,

60
00:05:08,173 --> 00:05:10,258
you'll have to go through me!

61
00:05:12,385 --> 00:05:14,512
[MEREOLEONA]
Five against one.

62
00:05:14,596 --> 00:05:16,723
Good enough odds for you?

63
00:05:22,812 --> 00:05:24,481
The captain's tough,
but not even she

64
00:05:24,564 --> 00:05:27,359
can hold her own against
all those enemies at once!

65
00:05:27,442 --> 00:05:29,527
Come on. We have to go help her!

66
00:05:29,611 --> 00:05:32,280
[ZORA]
No way, stupid, we're leaving.

67
00:05:32,364 --> 00:05:35,033
What? You can't just
abandon her like that!

68
00:05:35,116 --> 00:05:37,869
At this rate, she won't
make it out alive!

69
00:05:37,952 --> 00:05:41,581
And if we go waltzin' back in
there without a solid plan,

70
00:05:41,664 --> 00:05:44,584
then none of us are
getting out alive.

71
00:05:44,668 --> 00:05:47,379
You don't even have magic,
so you've got no idea

72
00:05:47,462 --> 00:05:50,048
how powerful these
body-snatchers are.

73
00:05:50,131 --> 00:05:54,719
Do you seriously think I wanted
to let a royal save my neck?

74
00:05:54,803 --> 00:05:57,389
The point is, running
away is our best shot

75
00:05:57,472 --> 00:06:00,016
at somebody surviving this.

76
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,019
She was strong to
make that choice.

77
00:06:03,103 --> 00:06:06,064
So don't let it all
be for nothing, runt!

78
00:06:12,696 --> 00:06:17,951
I'll cast Wing Magic:
Angel Wing, Gift!

79
00:06:18,034 --> 00:06:19,953
Do you expect to
emerge victorious

80
00:06:20,036 --> 00:06:21,496
in a fight against us?

81
00:06:21,579 --> 00:06:23,915
My, you humans have gotten
awfully impertinent

82
00:06:23,998 --> 00:06:25,917
while we've been asleep,
haven't you?

83
00:06:26,001 --> 00:06:28,920
I believe I said less
talk, more action.

84
00:06:29,004 --> 00:06:30,463
All right, if that's
what you want,

85
00:06:30,547 --> 00:06:32,799
then I say we should
make this quick and easy.

86
00:06:32,882 --> 00:06:35,635
Yes, unlike you greedy,
self-serving humans,

87
00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:37,595
we elves are connected
to others of our kind

88
00:06:37,679 --> 00:06:40,098
by a common bond that
can never be broken!

89
00:06:40,181 --> 00:06:42,392
So, try as you might,
your pitiful attacks

90
00:06:42,475 --> 00:06:45,103
won't put a scratch
on any of us!

91
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:49,691
Wing Magic: Angel Flapping!

92
00:06:57,032 --> 00:06:59,284
[MEREOLEONA]
Calidos Brachium!

93
00:07:02,996 --> 00:07:05,206
[MEREOLEONA]
There really are too many.

94
00:07:08,752 --> 00:07:13,173
Picture Magic: Subterranean
Giant's Iron Arm!

95
00:07:13,256 --> 00:07:15,425
You may be strong,
but you won't be able

96
00:07:15,508 --> 00:07:19,387
to burn this big fella
so easily! [giggles]

97
00:07:30,648 --> 00:07:32,233
[MEREOLEONA]
That grazed me.

98
00:07:32,317 --> 00:07:34,235
Have my senses been dulled?

99
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,572
It feels like my attacks have
been toned down as well.

100
00:07:37,655 --> 00:07:41,117
What's wrong? [gasps]

101
00:07:41,201 --> 00:07:46,122
Snow Magic: Phantom Snow Garden.

102
00:07:46,206 --> 00:07:47,999
This technique can
weaken the senses

103
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:50,335
of everyone in the area.

104
00:07:50,418 --> 00:07:52,545
It doesn't have any
effect on elves, however,

105
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:55,006
so it puts us at an
even greater advantage.

106
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:56,549
Aren't you clever?

107
00:07:56,633 --> 00:07:57,926
[FRAGIL]
I must say.

108
00:07:58,009 --> 00:08:00,845
For a human, you sure
know your way around mana.

109
00:08:00,929 --> 00:08:02,389
Still, it's only
a matter of time

110
00:08:02,472 --> 00:08:04,140
before you're defeated for good.

111
00:08:04,224 --> 00:08:06,351
[crash]

112
00:08:07,727 --> 00:08:09,771
You've got a lot of nerve
challenging the woman

113
00:08:09,854 --> 00:08:12,315
who was twice your
captain. Ruben!

114

My name isn't Ruben.

I am Rossa! Besides,

116
00:08:16,403 --> 00:08:19,280
I'd never align myself
with such a brute!

117
00:08:19,364 --> 00:08:20,699
Is that right?

Variable Hardness Prison!

120
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,754
I hope you die in there.

121
00:08:34,838 --> 00:08:35,797
It's over.

122
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,173
What a happy ending!

123
00:08:37,257 --> 00:08:38,925
You got that right!

124
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,304
It can't be!

125
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:55,650
And to think, you were a member
of the Crimson Lion Kings.

126
00:08:56,693 --> 00:09:01,906
Which means it's only fitting
that you die by my fire!

127
00:09:03,033 --> 00:09:04,826
[RUBEN]
What's this strange feeling?

128
00:09:04,909 --> 00:09:08,121
This body's instinctively
afraid of her!

129
00:09:08,204 --> 00:09:12,876
Never again will I allow
a friend to be murdered!

130
00:09:26,473 --> 00:09:30,101
Farewell, Madam Royal.

[MEREOLEONA] You're here
to kill humans, right?

Well, sorry, but it
turns out you missed one!

[RHYA]
This woman.

It's like she's immortal!

00:09:56,378 --> 00:09:58,296
You started this fight!

139
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,173
Now, finish it!

...alive.

00:10:52,851 --> 00:10:56,521
Wow. That is pretty impressive.

How is it possible
you're still standing,

after the beating you just took?

149
00:11:01,776 --> 00:11:05,238
[MEREOLEONA] I'll get up
as many times as it takes

00:11:05,321 --> 00:11:08,616
until all you monsters are dead!

Don't ya have the sense
to know it's over?

00:11:11,119 --> 00:11:13,455
Just stop.

153
00:11:13,538 --> 00:11:15,498
Yeah, you're right.

154
00:11:15,582 --> 00:11:20,754
Once I cast my strongest
spell, it will be over.

What? She's not done?

What is that odd
sensation? It stings!

159

Despite how much power
I used to soften the blow...

How can a human
be that powerful?

We might as well put
her out of her misery,

be for nothing, runt!

not fair that she made

that decision all on her own!

'Cause if you ask me,

205
00:15:03,018 --> 00:15:06,896
the best thing is for all
three of us to survive!

You're even denser
than I thought, shorty.

Those people aren't just tough,
they're freaks of nature!

Even your dark Anti-magic
form won't do us any good!

209
00:15:16,614 --> 00:15:18,992
I know! And besides,
that form is attracted

210
00:15:19,075 --> 00:15:20,869
to large amounts of
magic power, which means

211
00:15:20,952 --> 00:15:22,454
it wouldn't be the best
thing for gettin' us

tooth and nail over this?

You actually think they'll
all do something at once?

That'd be some convenient
timing, smart guy.

[ZORA] Well, what do ya know?
The little runt called it.

226
00:15:57,781 --> 00:16:00,533
To be fair, it's only
'cause the captain's last move

227
00:16:00,617 --> 00:16:02,452
forced 'em into a corner.

the strength of our spell.

with my Counter trap.

But even two times
the amount of power

00:16:18,051 --> 00:16:20,762
won't be enough to break
through their defenses!

to come along with
us to see Licht.
