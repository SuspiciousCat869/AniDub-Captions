00:00:23,638 --> 00:00:25,682
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:25,765 --> 00:00:30,186
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:32,439
All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:32,522 --> 00:00:36,276
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:40,822
The hero's name was
Lumiere Silvamillion Clover.

6
00:00:42,532 --> 00:00:45,535
[NARRATOR] He was later hailed
as the First Wizard King,

7
00:00:45,618 --> 00:00:48,538
and his story became legend.

8
00:02:33,435 --> 00:02:36,563
I'm one of the
Black Bulls now. Me.

9
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:43,028
[SECRÉ] Oh, Prince. So many
things have happened.

10
00:02:43,111 --> 00:02:44,320
So much has changed

11
00:02:44,404 --> 00:02:47,615
since the day we
met 500 years ago.

12
00:02:53,663 --> 00:02:55,206
Why, hello there.

13
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,959
You must be Secré,
right? I'm sorry.

14
00:02:58,043 --> 00:02:59,336
I would have come to you,

15
00:02:59,419 --> 00:03:02,047
but I've been totally buried
in my research lately.

16
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:04,883
So tell me about
this magic of yours.

17
00:03:04,966 --> 00:03:07,093
Sealing Magic?

18
00:03:07,177 --> 00:03:09,095
I've never heard of that before!

19
00:03:09,179 --> 00:03:12,015
It must be rare.
You're so lucky!

20
00:03:12,098 --> 00:03:13,683
How can we put it to use?

21
00:03:13,767 --> 00:03:16,978
Thinking about it
is so exciting!

22
00:03:17,062 --> 00:03:18,313
[SECRÉ]
Magical tools?

23
00:03:18,396 --> 00:03:19,564
[LUMIERE]
That's right.

24
00:03:19,647 --> 00:03:21,858
With these, even someone
born without any magic

25
00:03:21,941 --> 00:03:23,777
can use all kinds of spells.

26
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,153
I think it'll be
a good way to make

27
00:03:25,236 --> 00:03:27,614
our society more
equal in the future.

28
00:03:27,697 --> 00:03:30,367
Equal? You're dreaming.

29
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:33,953
It can be done, with the
help of my magic items.

30
00:03:34,037 --> 00:03:37,415
I'm sure your ability will be
a huge help in making them!

31
00:03:37,499 --> 00:03:40,752
I know. Can you seal
magic into objects?

32
00:03:40,835 --> 00:03:42,170
[SECRÉ]
Um, yes.

33
00:03:42,253 --> 00:03:45,507
[LUMIERE]
Wow, really? That's perfect!

34
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,592
[SECRÉ]
And so... I helped the prince

35
00:03:47,676 --> 00:03:51,221
with his magical inventions.

36
00:03:51,304 --> 00:03:54,891
I'd never met anyone else
like him in my whole life.

37
00:03:54,974 --> 00:03:56,601
There were some
members of his family

38
00:03:56,685 --> 00:03:59,437
who resented him because
of the progressive ideas

39
00:03:59,521 --> 00:04:00,939
that he championed.

40
00:04:01,022 --> 00:04:03,358
But he didn't let
that bother him.

41
00:04:03,441 --> 00:04:08,321
He remained strong and honest,
never compromising his beliefs.

42
00:04:11,449 --> 00:04:13,618
[SECRÉ] I didn't know
it then, but the prince

43
00:04:13,702 --> 00:04:16,955
associated with a group that
was different than humans.

44
00:04:17,038 --> 00:04:19,374
They were the elves,
a race who was loved

45
00:04:19,457 --> 00:04:22,002
and blessed by mana,
and who lived their lives

46
00:04:22,085 --> 00:04:23,211
in quiet peace.

47
00:04:23,294 --> 00:04:24,796
[ELVES clammoring]

48
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:26,715
[ELF VILLAGER 95A]
Wow, I can't believe it!

49
00:04:26,798 --> 00:04:28,049
[ELF VILLAGER 95B]
Licht and his Sword Magic

50
00:04:28,133 --> 00:04:30,927
have been chosen by the
four-leaf clover grimoire!

51
00:04:31,011 --> 00:04:32,637
[PATRY]
What's so exciting, Mom?

52
00:04:32,721 --> 00:04:34,806
Well, you see, darling,
only a select few

53
00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:36,641
are given a grimoire
just like he got.

54
00:04:36,725 --> 00:04:39,060
It even comes with
an extra helping of luck!

55
00:04:39,144 --> 00:04:41,354
[PATRY]
Oh.

56
00:04:41,438 --> 00:04:43,898
Licht and his
four-leaf grimoire.

57
00:04:43,982 --> 00:04:45,650
He's so cool!

58
00:04:48,778 --> 00:04:50,321
[SECRÉ]
The three leaves of the clover

59
00:04:50,405 --> 00:04:52,073
each stand for something.

60
00:04:52,157 --> 00:04:55,952
One is integrity, one
is hope, and one is love.

61
00:04:56,036 --> 00:04:58,455
Good luck dwells within
the fourth leaf.

62
00:04:58,538 --> 00:05:01,791
And in the fifth leaf,
there lives the devil.

63
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:03,668
Back then, we all assumed

64
00:05:03,752 --> 00:05:06,463
that was nothing
but an old saying.

65
00:05:06,546 --> 00:05:08,548
[PATRY] What do you
think about all this?

66
00:05:08,631 --> 00:05:09,549
[LICHT]
Hm?

67
00:05:09,632 --> 00:05:10,675
You know.

68
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:12,218
There's been a lot
of talk about humans

69
00:05:12,302 --> 00:05:14,637
planning to attack us.

70
00:05:14,721 --> 00:05:16,765
I'm sure it's a rumor.

71
00:05:16,848 --> 00:05:19,267
It's still a possibility
though, isn't it?

72
00:05:19,351 --> 00:05:20,560
I mean, think.

73
00:05:20,643 --> 00:05:22,645
The human race is so wicked
and mean-spirited,

74
00:05:22,729 --> 00:05:25,023
they slaughter helpless animals
just for the sport of it,

75
00:05:25,106 --> 00:05:27,108
without giving it
a second thought.

00:05:28,943 --> 00:05:30,487

I'm sorry.

00:06:03,186 --> 00:06:04,854
[LUMIERE] Besides,
a Wind Magic user like you

88
00:06:04,938 --> 00:06:06,398
isn't supposed to be
getting herself caught

in a mana tornado.
What were you thinking?

Thank you for helping my sister.

[gasps]

the same four-leaf grimoires.

95
00:06:31,965 --> 00:06:34,509
For the first time,
the prince had found a peer

96
00:06:34,592 --> 00:06:37,679
in Licht, the
leader of the elves.

97
00:06:39,097 --> 00:06:41,307
Let's foster understanding.

98
00:06:41,391 --> 00:06:44,853
Your elvish mana really
is a remarkable thing!

99
00:06:44,936 --> 00:06:48,481
If we combine that with our
own magic-item technology,

100
00:06:48,565 --> 00:06:51,735
this land will be safer
and more prosperous!

101
00:06:51,818 --> 00:06:54,571
Let's all work together,
hand in hand!

[ELVES chattering]

103
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,329
[SECRÉ] By combining his work
with the elves' resources,

104
00:07:03,413 --> 00:07:06,875
the prince developed magic-item
technology ever further.

105
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:09,210
And the world he'd
dreamed of, where both races

106
00:07:09,294 --> 00:07:12,339
could live in harmony,
was becoming a reality.

107
00:07:12,422 --> 00:07:14,674
He and Licht were best friends.

108
00:07:14,758 --> 00:07:18,887
And soon, they would
become family as well.

109

[VETTO]
Is it true? You're with child?

It's nothing.

You're still little;
you'll understand one day.

I'm sure some humans
won't approve of that.

Probably. But, still.

With your help, we can
create a new world

have to arrive late
to your wedding.

Father has summoned me
to the palace that day,

and I can't refuse.

I know you're disappointed
that he and the others

but please, don't worry.

I'm sure they'll come
to understand someday.

[TETIA] Yes. And it's
all right, even if you're late

But, it's likely that even then,

his plot was already in motion.

140
00:08:46,224 --> 00:08:48,560
[LUMIERE]
Why did Father call me here?

141
00:08:48,643 --> 00:08:50,270
We didn't mention
the wedding to anyone,

142
00:08:50,353 --> 00:08:52,564
so it must be coincidence.

143
00:08:52,647 --> 00:08:55,066
I should hurry, or I'll miss it.

A soul from the other

Perhaps they've gone
to confront that other race

that's plotting to use
your unwitting princess

to topple this entire kingdom,
but that's only a guess.

There's the device we made!

[SECRÉ] His items stored

to work much more slowly

314
00:19:17,939 --> 00:19:19,816
and carefully next time,

315
00:19:19,899 --> 00:19:22,777
in an era where you
two don't exist.

316
00:19:30,243 --> 00:19:33,204
[LUMIERE]
Secré! Are you hurt?

317
00:19:33,288 --> 00:19:35,123
[SECRÉ]
You're alive!

318
00:19:35,206 --> 00:19:38,626
[LUMIERE] You managed
to seal that devil away.

319
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,712
Yes, it should contain
him for a little while,

320
00:19:40,795 --> 00:19:43,006
but it won't hold out
forever, so we--

321
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:48,386
[SECRÉ]
No! Prince.

322
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:50,555
This is the way it should be.

323
00:19:50,638 --> 00:19:55,935
I kept my promise to
Licht, so it's okay.

324
00:20:00,482 --> 00:20:01,733
[SECRÉ]
Don't worry.

325
00:20:01,816 --> 00:20:05,779
I'm going to use the
magic stones to seal you.

326
00:20:05,862 --> 00:20:07,989
It probably won't be perfect,

327
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:11,076
but it should at least
keep you alive.

328
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:14,120
If the devil's seal is broken,
then the peaceful future

329
00:20:14,204 --> 00:20:16,206
we fought so hard for
will be taken away!

330
00:20:16,289 --> 00:20:17,957
Think about what
you're doing, Secré.

331
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:20,043
If you use any more of
that forbidden magic,

332
00:20:20,126 --> 00:20:22,462
your humanity's going
to be lost forever!

333
00:20:22,545 --> 00:20:25,799
That's better than letting
you die here, Your Highness.

334
00:20:25,882 --> 00:20:27,676
It's just as he said.

335
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:30,512
You're our hope
for a brighter future!

336
00:20:37,894 --> 00:20:42,524
[SECRÉ] When I finally woke up,
several centuries had passed.

337
00:20:45,527 --> 00:20:49,114
[SECRÉ] So, the prince began
his long slumber as a statue.

338
00:20:49,197 --> 00:20:52,951
And for some reason,
I was turned into a bird.

339
00:20:54,452 --> 00:20:58,456
[SECRÉ] I've been spared,
but in this small form.

340
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:01,042
I'll need help from
the future mages.

341
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:04,295
[SECRÉ]
That day,

342
00:21:04,379 --> 00:21:07,298
I felt the presence
of a powerful hope.

343
00:21:07,382 --> 00:21:10,885
A hope that could stand
against that fearsome devil.

344
00:21:12,762 --> 00:21:18,476
[ASTA, YUNO crying]

345
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,562
[HIGH PRIEST]
Two more for us, eh?

346
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,985
[YUNO crying]

347
00:21:27,068 --> 00:21:30,405
[HIGH PRIEST]
Aw, sh. There's a good boy.

348
00:21:33,116 --> 00:21:34,492
Are you brothers?

349
00:21:34,576 --> 00:21:37,912
Same age, so possibly
twins, as well.

350
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:39,831
No, they're neither.

351
00:21:39,914 --> 00:21:42,334
This one here is sweet
and well behaved.

352
00:21:42,417 --> 00:21:47,088
And, this one, well,
he's a bit spirited.

353
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:51,468
Then there's the fact that
they don't look a thing alike.

354
00:21:51,551 --> 00:21:54,012
[HIGH PRIEST]
Hm... "Yuno."

355
00:21:56,431 --> 00:21:58,350
Now, for this spirited
little fell--

356
00:21:58,433 --> 00:22:00,727
Ow!

357
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:03,688
Ow! A bit too spirited.

358
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:12,238
[HIGH PRIEST]
"Asta," eh?

359
00:22:12,322 --> 00:22:14,282
Well, you've had
a tough beginning,

360
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:15,992
but your worries are over.

361
00:22:16,076 --> 00:22:20,372
As of today, boys,
this will be your home.

362
00:22:20,455 --> 00:22:23,041
Asta and Yuno.

363
00:23:57,135 --> 00:23:59,471
[SECRÉ] Hope that can
stand against the devil.

364
00:23:59,554 --> 00:24:01,848
I wagered everything
on that wish.
