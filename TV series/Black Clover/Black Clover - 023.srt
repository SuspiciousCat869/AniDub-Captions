00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,708
[ASTA]
Damn it. Now what?

164
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:41,083
[RADES cackles]
Finish him!

165
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,791
[RADES]
No. Impossible.

166
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:09,458
My Alfred... Reduced to
cinders with one strike!

167
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:14,875
[RADES]
It was him.

168
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,625
[ASTA]
What's wrong with me?

169
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:29,416
Why couldn't I beat him?

170
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,666
I wanted to do it on my own.

171
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:35,583
I interfered in your fight.

172
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:38,083
It was necessary. I'm sorry.

173
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:41,375
I thought it a pity
for a Magic Knight

174
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:43,625
of your caliber to die here.

175
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:50,375
Forgive me.

176
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:53,833
I will say, though.

177
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:55,416
For a commoner with no magic,

178
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,291
you handled yourself well
against a difficult enemy.

179
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,416
You know, kid. I like you.

180
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,458
Come join our crew.

181
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:03,708
[FUEGOLEON]
He was right.

182
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:05,125
It pains me to admit it,

183
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:08,125
but Yami showed greater
foresight than the rest of us.

184
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:16,083
[FUEGOLEON]
Asta, was it?

185
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,250
Earlier.

186
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:22,083
You said you planned to
become the Wizard King.

187
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:24,791
Say what?

188
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:27,166
You think that you can
be the Wizard King?

189
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,583
Whatever Anti-Magic
abilities you have,

190
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,541
you're a brainless brat.

191
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:34,416
You'll never amount to anything.

192
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,625
[FUEGOLEON]
Asta.

193
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:39,791
It seems that I am
your rival as well.

194
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,333
[gasps]

195
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,625
Interesting turn of events.

196
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,500
The Black Bull boy
couldn't handle it,

197
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:52,458
so it looks like I've
got a new opponent.

198
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:55,125
[laughs] None other
than the captain

199
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:57,875
of the Crimson Lion Kings.

200
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:01,916
The great, Fuegoleon Vermillion.

201
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:04,583
[FUEGOLEON]
You've done enough.

202
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:06,708
You can leave
the rest to me now.

203
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:29,041
[WRAITH 23A growls]

204
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,291
He's all right!

205
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,541
My brother's got this.

206
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:44,458
[ASTA] Did he really mean
what he said before?

207
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:47,083
It seems that I am
your rival as well.

208
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:50,041
A captain's rival? No way!

209
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:54,958
[yells]

210
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:57,041
This is no time
to be giving up!

211
00:12:57,125 --> 00:13:01,000
I'll fight with you.
I can keep going!

212
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,666
No, you can't.

213
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:06,333
[whimpers] Like I wasn't
already hurt enough?

214
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:08,041
[FUEGOLEON]
Exactly.

215
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:11,458
A warrior must always be aware
of his body's condition.

216
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:15,000
He must assess whether or not
he is truly able to fight.

217
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:18,291
[FUEGOLEON]
Right now I would say

218
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,750
that you most likely are not.

219
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:23,875
Your brash fearlessness
may well be

220
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:25,666
the greatest weapon you have,

221
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,416
but you must learn
to remain calm.

222
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,250
That is, if you truly do
wish to be the Wizard King.

223
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:32,833
[gasps]

224
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:40,041
Tell me. What is the
purpose of this attack?

225
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:43,083
Your actions are too
inconsistent for this

226
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:45,791
to be a true invasion,
and too organized

227
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:48,375
for it to be some
sort of terrorism.

228
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,291
Just who are you?

229
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:51,875
You really don't know?

230
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:54,833
Well. I can't say I'm surprised.

231
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:58,291
Though it's a shame I'm the only
one enjoying this reunion.

232
00:13:58,375 --> 00:13:59,875
What's that?

233
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:03,000
Ha! I was a Magic Knight.

234
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:05,750
Inducted six years ago
as a top candidate.

235
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,083
[BOTH gasp]

236
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:10,416
One of us? No, that
can't be possible.

237
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,791
More than possible,
I assure you.

238
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:15,666
Though I suppose you took
little note of me at the time.

239
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,958
[gasps]

240
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:26,250
[FUEGOLEON]
He's a regular citizen.

241
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,708
But his power is incredible.

242
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:32,708
[STAFF 4A]
Do we have any hands, Captains?

243
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:38,041
It's been a long time,
but I remember you.

244
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:39,166
Your name?

245
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,416
[RADES huffs]
The name's Rades.

246
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,750
Rades, that's right.

247
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,625
You were chosen by
the Purple Orcas,

248
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:47,166
so why are you fighting
against us now?

249
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:50,375
Because those shortsighted
fools kicked me out.

250
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:52,333
You were expelled?

251
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:54,041
That doesn't make sense.

252
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:57,250
You were strong,
had so much potential.

253
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:58,625
They were frightened
by what I could do

254
00:14:58,708 --> 00:14:59,833
with my Wraith Magic.

255
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:02,250
They said it was
dangerous. Forbidden.

256
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,375
I was exiled not
just from my squad,

257
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:06,083
but from the entire kingdom.

258
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:08,000
I'm only an average citizen.

259
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:10,000
No one cared enough
to stand up for me.

260
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,416
No one!

261
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,666
I was beneath them--

262
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,125
it didn't matter that
my skills were greater.

263
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:18,250
Greater than the nobles',
greater than anyone's!

264
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:19,750
Magic is supposed
to be everything,

265
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,458
and yet they cast me aside.

266
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:23,291
Fools!

267
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:24,625
There ya have it, Captain!

268
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:26,000
I'm here to use my cursed power

269
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:27,791
to get revenge on
the Magic Knights

270
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,708
and the kingdom rejected me.

271
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,375
That is the purpose
of this attack.

272
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:36,833
[VALTOS] Well, that's one
of the purposes, anyway.

273
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:40,458
All of this, just to
get your revenge?

274
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:44,125
Don't toy with me! You fool!

275
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:47,041
You doubt me? Ha!

276
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:49,041
That's the thing about reasons.

277
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:51,416
They're usually quite simple.

Nope, we've got
this under control!

Don't worry about us!

while I handle the mage.

[LEOPOLD]
Yes, sir!

00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:15,291
[ASTA]
Wow! These guys are hardcore!

290
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,083
Real warrior brothers!

291
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:19,541
You don't actually think
that's going to work?

292
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:22,750
Their magics are too mismatched
for a decent fight.

293
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:24,666
Not that I was going
to let you help.

294
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,208
They're on their own.

00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:34,750
That's enough talking.
Time to fight.

This fellow was extremely
good at defensive magic

302
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:58,833
back when he was alive.

303
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:01,041
With a dash of my
curse powers thrown in,

304
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:03,666
we're practically impervious.

305
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,375
Jeez! Another one?

306
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,125
How many does he have?

307
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:08,500
[FUEGOLEON]
Asta!

308
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:10,166
Uh, sir?

309
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,125
[FUEGOLEON]
Remember what I said before,

310
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:15,083
about staying calm?

311
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:16,708
Pay close attention.

312
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:19,291
You're so sure you'll
come out on top, aren't you?

313
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:22,750
Defensive magic isn't the
only area in which he excels.

[FUEGOLEON] Flame Creation
Magic: Ignis Columna!

315
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,166
So, you've got yourself
a magic barrier

316
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,041
just like Carl, huh?

317
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:41,416
[RADES] Fine, let's see
how well you hold up

318
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,125
when we combine
an ironclad defense

319
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:44,916
with a rapid-fire attack.

320
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,291
Indeed, I appear to
be quite helpless.

321
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:50,291
[cackles] Aw, is that
all you've got?

322
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:53,750
I have to say, Captain,
I'm very disappointed in you.

323
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,083
My Flame Magic: Sol Linea.

324
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:18,291
[FUEGOLEON] When you attacked,
the mana grew thin

325
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:21,416
in some places across the
barrier for the briefest moment.

326
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,291
Those were the spots
I aimed for.

327
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:25,583
You think I've never
been up against

328
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:28,750
that sort of attack before?

329
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:30,125
Listen up, you two!

330
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:31,666
[BOTH gasp]

331
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,375
[FUEGOLEON]
You are Magic Knights.

332
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:35,291
In the line of duty,
you will constantly face

333
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:38,375
strong foes and tricky magic.

334
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:39,958
You must calmly
judge your abilities

335
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:41,458
and those of your enemy.

336
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:44,291
Fight bravely, but keep a cool
head and maintain control.

337
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:47,583
It's not easy, but if you can
do that, you will not lose.

338
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:48,375
Understood?

339
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:50,083
[BOTH]
Yes, sir!

340
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:52,958
[ASTA] That quickly, he zeroed
in on the enemy's weakness

341
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:55,375
and managed to
reassure his allies.

342
00:18:55,458 --> 00:19:00,416
So that's what it means to be
a Magic Knight squad captain.

343
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,416
Man, he's awesome!

344
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,541
No, it can't be.

345
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:09,250
He beat my Number One
wraith... so easily.

346
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:12,416
I should have won. Not him.

347
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:15,125
[FUEGOLEON]
Listen to me, Rades.

348
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:16,583
[RADES]
Huh?

349
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:21,375
You have incredible talent,
as well as powerful magic.

350
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:23,166
But wielded without
a just spirit,

351
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,750
they are no more than savagery.

352
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,208
You're a monster.

353
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,208
They were right to
have expelled you!

354
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:30,458
[RADES gasps]

355
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,291
[MARX]
I have a report, sire!

356
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:39,458
Almost all of the assailants
have now been neutralized.

357
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,166
Have they?

358
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,583
Well, it certainly
took them long enough.

359
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,791
The Magic Knights should
hone their skills.

360
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:49,875
[yawns] All right,
then. And Julius?

361
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:53,416
Is he still off gallivanting
about somewhere?

362
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,541
He's out on an
important mission, sire.

363
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:57,833
Honestly, now.

364
00:19:57,916 --> 00:20:00,083
I can't imagine what he
could possibly be doing

365
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:03,333
that's more important
than protecting me.

366
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:09,708
It's over.

367
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,625
I'd still like to know
what those things were.

368
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:13,458
[SHIREN]
Mm...

369
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:15,041
[HAMON]
Whatever they were,

370
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:18,416
I find it highly unlikely that
they were our true enemy today.

371
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,000
[laughs]

372
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:23,291
[SOL] This is what happens to
people who dare to attack Char.

373
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:24,291
Serves you right!

374
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:25,750
The women of the
Blue Rose Knights

375
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,875
are the only ones who
can lay hands on her.

376
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:29,291
Enough.

377
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:31,500
You're just asking
to be misunderstood.

378
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:34,291
Only the Blue Rose Knights
can touch her tender skin!

379
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:35,625
Try again, Sol.

380
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:36,958
[SOL]
Hm?

381
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:40,458
[SOLID laughs] What's this?
Are we done already?

382
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:44,375
[NEBRA chuckles] Too bad.
I hardly got to play at all.

383
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,500
[NOZEL]
Something isn't right here.

384
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:51,541
[ALECDORA sighs]
I guess it's all but over.

385
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:55,208
[MIMOSA]
Ugh. Creepy. So very creepy.

386
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:57,916
[YUNO] I need to get
stronger so I can handle

387
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,625
something like this more easily.

388
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:02,666
[CITIZEN 23A] Amazing!
Such unbelievable strength!

389
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:06,000
Let's hear it for the
Magic Knights, everyone!

390
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:07,875
[CITIZENS]
Hip-hip hooray!

391
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:10,458
[CATHERINE] It's a bit
early to be celebrating.

392
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:14,041
The preparations must be
nearly complete by now.

393
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:16,500
[CATHERINE]
Time for a feast.

394
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,541
Such lively, young mana.

395
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:21,625
Absolutely delicious.

[HEAD CHEF 23A]
"3-Second Courtly Cooking."

398
00:23:01,291 --> 00:23:03,666
Hello, everyone. Clover
Kingdom's royal chef here,

399
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,625
bringing you easy
three-second recipes

400
00:23:05,708 --> 00:23:06,916
even a beginner can make.

401
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,333
Today we're whipping up
a three-second curry.

402
00:23:09,416 --> 00:23:10,666
To keep it simple,

403
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,416
we'll start with a roux
purchased from the market.

404
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,458
Then carrots, onions,
and potatoes.

405
00:23:14,541 --> 00:23:16,791
You can add mushrooms
or tomatoes if you like.

406
00:23:16,875 --> 00:23:18,125
Flavoring your curry
with a touch

407
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:21,041
of chocolate or coffee
can give it more depth.

408
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:23,041
Now, simply take
your ingredients, and...

409
00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:24,250
[yells]

410
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:26,458
Use magic to dice them
up and stew them.

411
00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:27,666
The more passion
you put into it,

412
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:30,375
the better your curry will be.

413
00:23:30,458 --> 00:23:32,708
Three seconds and done!
Wasn't that easy?

414
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:34,916
All right, come to Mama!

415
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:37,375
So good!

416
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:38,750
This has been Three-Second

that anyone can make.

See you later!

419
