1
00:00:23,763 --> 00:00:25,640
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:25,724 --> 00:00:28,476
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:32,105 --> 00:00:34,399
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:34,482 --> 00:00:37,152
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:43,533 --> 00:00:45,535
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:45,618 --> 00:00:49,748
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:54,294
[ASTA, YUNO]
Here we go!

8
00:00:54,377 --> 00:00:57,922
[YUNO, ASTA growling]

9
00:00:58,006 --> 00:01:00,675
[BOTH]
Onward, Le Château de Verre!

10
00:01:02,385 --> 00:01:03,595
[YUNO]
It's over!

11
00:01:03,678 --> 00:01:05,472
[ASTA]
You're goin' down!

12
00:01:05,555 --> 00:01:06,723
[YUNO yells]

13
00:01:10,018 --> 00:01:16,524
[BOTH yelling]

14
00:01:20,153 --> 00:01:22,489
[NARRATOR] Asta and Yuno
joined forces to drive back

15
00:01:22,572 --> 00:01:25,450
the attacks of Klaus and Hamon.

16
00:01:25,533 --> 00:01:26,743
[gasps]

17
00:01:26,826 --> 00:01:28,286
[RHYA]
Licht?

18
00:01:38,713 --> 00:01:41,591
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, the real
Licht had been preparing

19
00:01:41,675 --> 00:01:43,551
to make his move.

20
00:03:20,607 --> 00:03:23,068
[YUNO]
I can't find an opening!

21
00:03:23,151 --> 00:03:25,195
Time to change my approach.

22
00:03:30,075 --> 00:03:31,534
[yells]

23
00:03:36,623 --> 00:03:38,249
[YUNO]
Not yet.

24
00:03:41,836 --> 00:03:43,254
[YUNO]
Not yet.

25
00:03:44,756 --> 00:03:46,633
[YUNO]
Not yet!

26
00:03:46,716 --> 00:03:49,594
All right. My turn!

27
00:03:49,678 --> 00:03:51,346
Mana Zone:

28
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,684
Spirit Storm!

29
00:04:08,488 --> 00:04:11,783
I'm not done yet!

30
00:04:11,866 --> 00:04:14,285
[RHYA]
Who <i>are</i> these two?

31
00:04:14,369 --> 00:04:17,122
You're not killin' Yuno!

32
00:04:18,498 --> 00:04:20,500
Or Asta, either!

33
00:04:21,835 --> 00:04:24,713
[ASTA, YUNO]
He's my rival!

34
00:04:33,346 --> 00:04:35,598
[ASTA]
He blocked it with that sword?

35
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,563
[YUNO] He's condensing
a huge amount of magic!

36
00:04:51,781 --> 00:04:53,867
[MIMOSA]
Is this Yuno's spell?

37
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,118
[gasps]

38
00:04:57,162 --> 00:05:02,625
[BOTH yelling]

39
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,173
The giant hole you just
made in the ceiling

40
00:05:50,256 --> 00:05:53,677
does kinda brighten
up the place.

41
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,389
But you lost your grimoire,
and both of your swords with it.

42
00:05:57,472 --> 00:05:59,766
You sure that was a good move?

43
00:06:01,351 --> 00:06:03,311
[RHYA] Guess he's not
in a talkin' mood.

44
00:06:03,395 --> 00:06:05,230
[gasps]

45
00:06:05,313 --> 00:06:09,025
Well, never mind the grimoire.

46
00:06:09,109 --> 00:06:13,113
It isn't mine anymore.

47
00:06:13,196 --> 00:06:14,447
[RHYA]
What?

48
00:06:14,531 --> 00:06:17,033
[LICHT]
Rhya. Let's go.

49
00:06:19,911 --> 00:06:22,872
[RHYA] Licht is finally
here for real now.

50
00:06:22,956 --> 00:06:25,083
That's all that matters.

51
00:06:33,174 --> 00:06:34,300
Asta!

52
00:06:34,384 --> 00:06:36,511
Ugh! What is that
weirdo's problem?

53
00:06:36,594 --> 00:06:39,639
Yuno's soaking wet now! Achoo!

54
00:06:39,723 --> 00:06:41,141
You better not have
given me a cold.

55
00:06:41,224 --> 00:06:43,476
Next time we meet,
I'm gonna sneeze on you!

56
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,271
[rustling]

57
00:06:47,564 --> 00:06:48,857
[MIMOSA]
Zora!

58
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:52,277
[ZORA] This way. There's
another captain here.

59
00:06:58,575 --> 00:07:02,370
Ah. They're fine,
they're just unconscious.

60
00:07:05,373 --> 00:07:07,042
Hello there, Rhya.

61
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:09,419
Hey, Ado.

62
00:07:09,502 --> 00:07:11,296
How's everything been?

63
00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:13,298
Not bad, thanks.

64
00:07:13,381 --> 00:07:15,258
Is he still...?

65
00:07:15,342 --> 00:07:16,426
[RHYA]
Yeah.

66
00:07:16,509 --> 00:07:17,761
Looks like all we can
do is wait for him

67
00:07:17,844 --> 00:07:19,888
to awaken the rest of the way.

68
00:07:19,971 --> 00:07:21,639
I suppose.

69
00:07:21,723 --> 00:07:23,016
So, where are the others?

70
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:24,726
One moment.

71
00:07:31,733 --> 00:07:32,734
Ha!

72
00:07:32,817 --> 00:07:34,652
It's been quite a
while, hasn't it?

73
00:07:34,736 --> 00:07:38,490
Five whole centuries!
But all of you look great.

74
00:07:38,573 --> 00:07:41,534
Well. 'Bout that time.

75
00:07:44,829 --> 00:07:47,415
Let's go pay the rest
of our friends a visit,

76
00:07:47,499 --> 00:07:50,960
and then, we'll wipe
out all humankind!

77
00:08:08,561 --> 00:08:11,439
[screams] I blacked out!

78
00:08:11,523 --> 00:08:12,691
Whoa, for some weird reason,

79
00:08:12,774 --> 00:08:14,859
my whole body hurts and
I'm drippin' wet, too!

80
00:08:14,943 --> 00:08:16,194
What's wrong with me?

81
00:08:16,277 --> 00:08:18,238
[YUNO] I liked it better
when you were knocked out.

82
00:08:18,321 --> 00:08:21,032
[BELL] You're gonna burst my
eardrums, you big, dumb idiot!

83
00:08:21,116 --> 00:08:22,367
Who you callin'--

84
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:23,702
Gah! My ears hurt, too!

85
00:08:23,785 --> 00:08:24,953
--This is the worst!
--[BELL] Dummy.

86
00:08:25,036 --> 00:08:28,498
You survived! I'm so relieved!

87
00:08:28,581 --> 00:08:30,083
[ASTA]
Yeah! I'm glad we're all oka--

88
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:31,793
[screams]

89
00:08:31,876 --> 00:08:34,212
Hey, where'd the hideout go?

90
00:08:34,295 --> 00:08:36,923
Crazy as it may sound,
it took off toward

91
00:08:37,007 --> 00:08:39,217
the royal capital while
you were out cold.

92
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,510
[ASTA]
What do you mean "it took off"?

93
00:08:40,593 --> 00:08:42,971
Like, how-ow-ow-ow-ow?

94
00:08:43,054 --> 00:08:45,515
You came back alive,
just like you promised.

95
00:08:45,598 --> 00:08:47,726
You're the luckiest
damn half-pint I know.

96
00:08:47,809 --> 00:08:48,727
[ASTA]
How's the captai--

97
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:50,061
[ASTA screams]

98
00:08:50,145 --> 00:08:52,355
She's unconscious,
but she'll pull through.

99
00:08:52,439 --> 00:08:54,441
[ASTA]
That's good news, at least!

100
00:08:54,524 --> 00:08:57,068
She won't be up any
time soon, though.

101
00:08:57,152 --> 00:08:59,195
I'd wake her, but I
don't have a death wish.

102
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,823
[EN]
You made it! This is wonderful!

103
00:09:01,906 --> 00:09:05,326
[ASTA] Mushroom Man and the
Silver Eagles capta-- [groans]

104
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:08,872
Two of our comrades seem
to have changed sides.

105
00:09:08,955 --> 00:09:11,041
Fortunately, we were
able to escape using

106
00:09:11,124 --> 00:09:13,668
my mushroom smokescreen
and the mobility boost

107
00:09:13,752 --> 00:09:15,462
from Nozel's magic.

108
00:09:15,545 --> 00:09:17,005
Really? Them, too?

109
00:09:17,088 --> 00:09:19,841
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

110
00:09:19,924 --> 00:09:22,552
[NOZEL]
Asta of the Black Bulls.

111
00:09:22,635 --> 00:09:24,346
He survived a battle
terrible enough

112
00:09:24,429 --> 00:09:27,098
to put Mereoleona
in that condition.

113
00:09:29,601 --> 00:09:31,061
Herbs'll fix ya!

114
00:09:31,144 --> 00:09:33,480
No prob! You guys eat, too!

115
00:09:33,563 --> 00:09:34,481
Sure.

116
00:09:34,564 --> 00:09:35,732
Nah, I'll pass.

117
00:09:35,815 --> 00:09:37,650
You really shouldn't
eat those raw.

118
00:09:37,734 --> 00:09:39,277
[BELL]
You'll get a tummy-ache.

119
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:41,154
[MIMOSA] I know these'll
probably make me sick,

120
00:09:41,237 --> 00:09:42,697
but Asta gave them to me.

121
00:09:42,781 --> 00:09:46,201
I can't let 'em go to waste!

122
00:09:46,284 --> 00:09:47,410
[NOZEL]
Here, use this.

123
00:09:47,494 --> 00:09:49,788
Magic Item: Eilia's Booth.

124
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:54,918
This tool provides
an enormous enhancement

125
00:09:55,001 --> 00:09:57,629
to the body's natural
healing abilities,

126
00:09:57,712 --> 00:09:59,255
which you three
desperately need.

127
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:01,341
Oh! That's great, thank you!

128
00:10:01,424 --> 00:10:04,260
Awesome, the pain's
already goin' away!

129
00:10:04,344 --> 00:10:06,596
What a useful magic item!

130
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,473
Thank you so much for your help!

131
00:10:08,556 --> 00:10:10,141
Nozel's a pretty decent guy,

132
00:10:10,225 --> 00:10:12,227
but I don't know how he
can see with that haircut.

133
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:15,021
Hold still, Yuno, let me
take away your pain,

134
00:10:15,105 --> 00:10:16,356
and give it to you!

135
00:10:16,439 --> 00:10:18,066
Hey, I don't want it!

136
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:20,485
Are you feeling
better, my darling?

137
00:10:20,568 --> 00:10:21,319
Yeah.

138
00:10:21,403 --> 00:10:23,363
Oh, thank goodness!

139
00:10:25,532 --> 00:10:27,534
You guys! You're all okay!

140
00:10:27,617 --> 00:10:28,451
Noelle!

141
00:10:28,535 --> 00:10:30,203
And she brought that.

142
00:10:30,286 --> 00:10:32,330
It's your big brother!

143
00:10:32,414 --> 00:10:34,207
What happened to you, Kirsch?

144
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:35,959
Man, you look like crap!

145
00:10:36,042 --> 00:10:39,629
[KIRSCH sighs] Even spattered
with blood, I'm still beautiful.

146
00:10:39,713 --> 00:10:42,340
[MIMOSA]
Ugh, I don't think so!

147
00:10:42,424 --> 00:10:46,177
[KIRSCH groans] I'm such
a gorgeously fragile flower.

148
00:10:46,261 --> 00:10:48,805
Okay, who is this nutball?

149
00:10:48,888 --> 00:10:51,057
Noelle! Where's the team?

150
00:10:51,141 --> 00:10:53,059
I don't know how
to explain all this,

151
00:10:53,143 --> 00:10:55,186
but Luck turned on us.

152
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,646
Aw, that sucks!

153
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,940
[KIRSCH]
That Crimson Lion, as well.

154
00:10:59,024 --> 00:11:00,692
Same with Klaus and Hamon.

155
00:11:00,775 --> 00:11:02,444
It was out of nowhere!

156
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,695
Don't forget Rill.

157
00:11:03,778 --> 00:11:05,321
This is bad.

158
00:11:05,405 --> 00:11:08,074
[sighs] They're pitiful.

159
00:11:08,158 --> 00:11:09,159
Hey!

160
00:11:09,242 --> 00:11:10,910
You have markings
on your face, too!

161
00:11:10,994 --> 00:11:12,454
Are you sure you're okay?

162
00:11:12,537 --> 00:11:14,164
I'm the same person I was.

163
00:11:14,247 --> 00:11:15,957
My magic's just
been boosted a bit.

164
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:17,167
[gasps]

165
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:20,337
All right, fine. I guess
I can spell it out.

166
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,255
How dare you condescend me?

167
00:11:22,339 --> 00:11:23,465
I'm royalty, after all!

168
00:11:23,548 --> 00:11:25,258
Oh, yeah, well,
I'm the Wind Spirit,

169
00:11:25,342 --> 00:11:26,843
so you're nothin'
special, missy!

170
00:11:26,926 --> 00:11:28,803
No one asked you!

171
00:11:28,887 --> 00:11:31,931
[NOZEL] The Spatial mage who
was on standby isn't here.

172
00:11:32,015 --> 00:11:34,267
He must've changed
sides like they did.

173
00:11:34,351 --> 00:11:35,477
[SILVER EAGLE 101A]
Captain Nozel!

174
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,645
Come in, can you hear me?

175
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:39,856
[NOZEL]
What's wrong?

176
00:11:39,939 --> 00:11:41,024
[SILVER EAGLE 101A]
Oh, good, you're there!

177
00:11:41,107 --> 00:11:42,692
I thought I would
never get through!

178
00:11:42,776 --> 00:11:44,235
What's that?

179
00:11:44,319 --> 00:11:47,489
A magic transmission device
that all of the captains have.

180
00:11:47,572 --> 00:11:48,740
[SILVER EAGLE 101A]
Several of our squad members

181
00:11:48,823 --> 00:11:50,450
have suddenly become violent!

182
00:11:50,533 --> 00:11:53,995
They're acting strange
and claiming to be elves!

183
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,830
The worst part is,
their magic power

184
00:11:55,914 --> 00:11:57,540
is much stronger than usual!

185
00:11:57,624 --> 00:11:59,501
We can't handle them alone!

186
00:11:59,584 --> 00:12:02,921
Apparently the other squads
are experiencing the same thing!

187
00:12:03,004 --> 00:12:05,840
Something must be taking
over the kingdo-- [screams]

188
00:12:05,924 --> 00:12:08,259
[NOZEL]
What was that? Answer me!

189
00:12:08,343 --> 00:12:10,762
Is this happenin'
all over the place?

190
00:12:10,845 --> 00:12:15,225
It's not lookin' good,
I know that much.

191
00:12:15,308 --> 00:12:19,020
Come what may, we're
still Magic Knights.

192
00:12:19,104 --> 00:12:21,106
Which means our
number-one responsibility

193
00:12:21,189 --> 00:12:23,817
is to protect the Clover
Kingdom, even if doing so

194
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:24,901
means we have to eliminate

195
00:12:24,984 --> 00:12:27,445
some of our own comrades
in the process.

196
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:32,367
[NOZEL] And even if it comes
at the cost of our lives.

197
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:34,536
But, Luck...

198
00:12:34,619 --> 00:12:38,623
When he attacked me before,
his spell didn't hit me.

199
00:12:43,962 --> 00:12:45,046
I missed ya!

200
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:48,133
Looks like I've
gotten a little rusty.

201
00:12:48,216 --> 00:12:50,218
Let's try again.

202
00:12:50,301 --> 00:12:52,554
[NOELLE]
He was moving extremely quickly,

203
00:12:52,637 --> 00:12:55,348
but we were still able
to get away from him.

204
00:12:55,432 --> 00:12:57,642
I think Luck made that happen!

205
00:12:57,726 --> 00:13:00,020
Well then, why did he hit me?

206
00:13:00,103 --> 00:13:01,855
I'm sure you deserved it.

207
00:13:01,938 --> 00:13:05,066
That means Luck's soul
is fighting to resist!

208
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,485
Just like Yuno
still has control!

209
00:13:07,569 --> 00:13:09,195
[NOELLE] And since we
know that's possible,

210
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,990
we should be able to restore
everyone's free will!

211
00:13:12,073 --> 00:13:14,034
There has to be a way!

212
00:13:14,117 --> 00:13:16,411
As Magic Knights,
we can save our squadmates

213
00:13:16,494 --> 00:13:18,371
and the Clover Kingdom!

214
00:13:18,455 --> 00:13:19,831
Yeah!

215
00:13:19,914 --> 00:13:22,417
Let's do it!

216
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,085
[NOZEL chuckles]

217
00:13:29,591 --> 00:13:33,178
All right! Go!

218
00:13:42,062 --> 00:13:43,980
[VILLAGER 101A]
What do you think that is?

219
00:13:44,064 --> 00:13:46,024
[VILLAGER 101B] As soon as
those light swords go away,

220
00:13:46,107 --> 00:13:47,359
now this happens?

221
00:13:47,442 --> 00:13:49,694
[VILLAGER 101C]
Why is the demon skull glowing?

222
00:13:49,778 --> 00:13:51,154
[VILLAGER 101AA]
It's frightening.

223
00:13:51,237 --> 00:13:52,697
Hey! See that?

224
00:13:52,781 --> 00:13:53,531
[VILLAGER 101BB]
Huh?

225
00:13:53,615 --> 00:13:55,784
What's happening this time?

226
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,040
It looks like daybreak.

227
00:14:03,792 --> 00:14:05,669
Nuh-uh. Not that!

228
00:14:05,752 --> 00:14:08,088
Something's coming.

229
00:14:24,104 --> 00:14:26,564
[gasps]

230
00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:29,067
[ARLU gasps]

231
00:14:36,658 --> 00:14:39,077
[VILLAGER 101E]
It's headed for the capital.

232
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,205
[VILLAGER 101F]
But what is it?

233
00:14:42,288 --> 00:14:44,666
[DIGIT]
Those are my friends, of course.

234
00:14:46,543 --> 00:14:48,003
[VILLAGER 101CC]
His "friends"?

235
00:14:48,086 --> 00:14:50,880
Look at his clothes.
He's dressed like a...

236
00:14:50,964 --> 00:14:54,634
Your robe tells me
you're a Magic Knight?

237
00:14:54,718 --> 00:14:56,594
[DIGIT] It would appear that
you humans have rapidly

238
00:14:56,678 --> 00:15:00,515
increased in number over
the last several centuries.

239
00:15:00,598 --> 00:15:02,267
[PRIEST]
Sir...

240
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:04,352
The people who possess
the least magic power

241
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:07,313
make their homes in
this area, and then,

242
00:15:07,397 --> 00:15:09,941
as you reach the center,
you begin to encounter

243
00:15:10,025 --> 00:15:12,193
the stronger inhabitants.

244
00:15:12,277 --> 00:15:16,906
I see your kind continues
to discriminate in petty ways.

245
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:19,284
So, Magic Knight? Or not?

246
00:15:19,367 --> 00:15:21,828
Kinda looks like he is.

247
00:15:21,911 --> 00:15:25,457
[DIGIT] And you weaklings are
the target of this prejudice.

248
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:29,169
You humans. So arbitrary.

249
00:15:29,252 --> 00:15:30,170
What?

250
00:15:30,253 --> 00:15:33,089
Hold on. Who are you, exactly?

251
00:15:33,173 --> 00:15:35,091
We do not discriminate.

252
00:15:35,175 --> 00:15:39,346
We slaughter all humans,
equally and swiftly.

Aw, yeah! I'm as good as new!

00:15:53,943 --> 00:15:55,528
Hey! Where'd your shirt go?

258
00:15:55,612 --> 00:15:56,654
I had to get a good look

259
00:15:56,738 --> 00:15:58,365
and make sure my
injuries are healed!

260
00:15:58,448 --> 00:16:02,202
Okay, now you know,
so get dressed already!

261
00:16:02,285 --> 00:16:03,244
Now that I've recovered,

262
00:16:03,328 --> 00:16:05,455
my beauty can shine
to the fullest!

263
00:16:05,538 --> 00:16:08,416
I kinda wish you hadn't
recovered at all.

264
00:16:10,168 --> 00:16:12,003
The captain should
be better, too, right?

265
00:16:12,087 --> 00:16:14,214
I don't understand why
she's not waking up.

266
00:16:14,297 --> 00:16:16,091
Just let her rest.

Oh, yeah! You can
have this back now!

It only works once.

Whoa, seriously?

270
00:16:22,138 --> 00:16:25,225
I mean, it's kinda cool-looking,
so I think I'll hang onto it.

271
00:16:25,308 --> 00:16:26,851
Do what you want.

272
00:16:26,935 --> 00:16:29,854
We're almost to
the Forsaken Realm.

273
00:16:29,938 --> 00:16:30,814
Huh?

274
00:16:30,897 --> 00:16:31,898
What's wrong?

275
00:16:31,981 --> 00:16:34,275
Someone's attacking that area.

276
00:16:36,986 --> 00:16:38,071
But, that's...

[BOTH]
...the Village!

there! We have to help!

[YUNO, ASTA gasp]

281
00:16:43,993 --> 00:16:45,745
We must proceed directly
to the capital

as quickly as possible.

283
00:16:47,497 --> 00:16:49,165
The best way to
protect Clover Kingdom

284
00:16:49,249 --> 00:16:52,127
is to secure the most
populated area first.

285
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:54,379
My hometown is part
of this kingdom!

You two may do as you
see fit, but we press on.

That said, you're both crucial
to our fighting strength.

Finish quickly and
meet us in the capital.

[NOZEL]
You'll remain with us, Noelle.

You're forcing me?

You want my help? Really?

296
00:17:20,238 --> 00:17:21,823
Although, if we're being honest,

297
00:17:21,906 --> 00:17:24,075
your very existence
is pointless.

298

This is no place for a
pathetic creature like you.

Right! Then I'll go!

[DIGIT]
I had always found it strange.

303
00:17:57,609 --> 00:18:00,445
Why did I possess
Poison Plant Magic?

304

It didn't seem logical, but...

305
00:18:03,365 --> 00:18:05,033
One day, I understood.

It feels like my whole body
is being burned alive.

310
00:18:14,668 --> 00:18:17,087
That's what this magic is for.

Hang in there!

So, some of you are able to
use a little magic, at least.

Are you of noble blood?

Well, no matter.

321
00:18:45,407 --> 00:18:48,785
Even the mightiest of humans
are powerless against the elves.

322
00:18:48,868 --> 00:18:51,705
Who is this guy? He's a monster!

323
00:18:51,788 --> 00:18:52,997
You're so cruel.

324
00:18:53,081 --> 00:18:54,833
Hurting a priest like that!

325
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:58,378
Listen. I don't know what
happened in your past,

326
00:18:58,461 --> 00:18:59,421
but what did the residents

327
00:18:59,504 --> 00:19:02,007
of this poor village
ever do to you?

328
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:06,094
We live simple, peaceful
lives, like anyone else!

329
00:19:06,177 --> 00:19:07,303
You'll be okay!

330
00:19:07,387 --> 00:19:09,431
I'll make all the
owwies disappear!

We cry.

00:19:10,432 --> 00:19:13,143
Gah! This is way too confusing!

333
00:19:13,226 --> 00:19:14,602
[LILY]
We struggle.

334
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:15,729
At this rate, I don't know

335
00:19:15,812 --> 00:19:17,772
how we'll make it
through the winter.

336

We worry, and yet!

338
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:23,361
At least we have enough food.

339
00:19:23,445 --> 00:19:25,613
Yeah, I love pop-potatoes!

340
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:28,616
You make the tastiest
dishes out of these, Sister!

341
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,368
I don't mind eating yours, Nash!

342

No way, I still want 'em!
Food is food!

00:19:42,005 --> 00:19:44,674
And live life with
everything we've got!

347
00:19:44,758 --> 00:19:46,384
We don't deserve
to die like this.

348
00:19:46,468 --> 00:19:48,428

Yeah!

351
00:19:51,431 --> 00:19:53,558
You're poor like the rest of us.

352
00:19:53,641 --> 00:19:58,813
Orphaned cast-off. Kids like
us don't get to have dreams.

353
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:00,523
Hey, Nash.

354
00:20:04,027 --> 00:20:06,154
No giving up, you hear me?!

355
00:20:06,237 --> 00:20:09,407
We can dream as
much as we want to!

356
00:20:09,491 --> 00:20:11,326
Even if you're a poor orphan,

357
00:20:11,409 --> 00:20:13,787
you can become great,
just like anyone else.

358
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:15,622
You can do anything you want.

359
00:20:15,705 --> 00:20:17,290
Make your dreams come true

360
00:20:17,374 --> 00:20:20,043
and make the people
you care about happy.

361
00:20:20,126 --> 00:20:22,587
That's exactly what
I'm going to prove.

362
00:20:22,671 --> 00:20:25,840
If by some chance,
some very small one,

363
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:28,551
you actually manage to
join the Magic Knights.

364
00:20:28,635 --> 00:20:30,011
Yeah, what?

365
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:32,263
Then I'll start believing
dreams really can come true.

366
00:20:32,347 --> 00:20:34,349
That I can be anything I want.

367
00:20:34,432 --> 00:20:37,602
And maybe one day, I'll
become a Magic Knight, too!

368
00:20:37,686 --> 00:20:39,896
Or, you know, whatever.

00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:47,237
be the biggest brother

371
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,738
Keep these guys safe.

We're countin' on you, Nash!

373
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:54,577
I agree.

374
00:20:54,661 --> 00:20:57,539
No one's life should
have to end in sadness.

375
00:20:57,622 --> 00:21:01,167
Therefore, I'll wipe out
the source of that sadness.

376
