Threatened by a ruthless demon,

00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:18,458
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:24,416
[NARRATOR] All seemed
lost until a lone mage

4
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,041
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,583
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:39,583
as the Wizard King, and
his story became legend.

7
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:48,375
Only those who are
strong will survive.

8
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:50,541
The weak deserve death.

Begone, boy!

[ASTA] He's still got
that Recovery magic.

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,583
I can't finish
him off. What now?

15
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:21,416
[NOELLE] Why are you just
sitting there, insect?

[NOELLE]
Listen to me.

17
00:01:24,708 --> 00:01:26,666
I am royalty, Asta,

18
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:30,916
and you are the first
commoner I've accepted.

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,083
Now get moving.

20
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:35,833
And don't you dare give up
until you beat him.

21
00:01:35,916 --> 00:01:37,458
Understand?

22
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,250
Yeah. I'll bring this guy
down, and I'll get one or two

23
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:46,291
hits in for you while I'm at it.

24
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:48,625
I live to destroy the weak!

25
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:51,291
Well, you're not
gonna destroy me!

26
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:53,625
I may not have any magic power,

27
00:01:53,708 --> 00:01:57,916

are my friends!

I'm dead.

31
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:59,041
He's... hit.

33
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,333
I'm fine.

34
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:04,458
Forget about me for now
and go look after him!

35

Oh, right, sure!

36
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:11,958
[MIMOSA]
This wound.

37
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:15,000
Can I even heal it with the
magic power I have left?

Open up your eyes, brat!

Try to hold on. You can do it.

Do you hear me?
You're not alone!

45
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,875
[FANA] Mars, is our
training getting to you?

46
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,958
When things get tough,
just close your eyes

47
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:42,375
and think about
the people you love.

48
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:43,666
That's why we're here.

49
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,708
We were born so we could
become powerful enough

to protect our country.

51
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,625

Once we've gotten strong,

52

that's when we'll get
to leave this place.

Do you think you'll be
the first one who goes?

I do.

55
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:14,125
I mean, how could you not be?

56
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:17,791
You're the strongest.
We all know it.

57
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:23,125
If I get out... I'll wait.

58
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:26,375
I promise. I'll wait for you.

Yeah!

00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,666
We'll go see the

This is your final test:

a fight to the death.

63
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:45,875
Only the last one standing

64
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:47,833
will be permitted to
leave here as a mage

65

in service to our country.

66

all be eliminated.

Which means he will be the one

let's use Fana.

84
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:13,375
Both for her
abilities and because

85
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:15,625
she was the last he defeated.

86
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:18,250
And thus, from the
deaths of his peers,

87
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,708
the mightiest mage is born.
