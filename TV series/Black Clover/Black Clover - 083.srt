Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,333
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:24,375
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4

stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:35,541

After his triumph, he was hailed

and his story became legend.

Team G won by a slim margin.

Go on. Take one more
step toward him.

00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:16,333
But you should know that
the second you do,

19
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:17,416
you're dead.

20
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,291
You Black Bulls
may be doing better

21
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:22,666
than expected, but you're
still worthless underlings.

22

You think you can
take the vice captain

23

Your rank has nothing
to do with this.

25

All we care about is
protecting our friend.

lucked out and failed upward

to get to this point,

28
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:39,541
but you're still a nobody
who's talking to someone

29
00:01:39,625 --> 00:01:42,333
completely out of your league.

Before the next teams
face off against each other,

allow me to put these Black
Bulls in their rightful place.

33
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:52,833
In fact, the fight
can start now.

34
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:55,833
Let the semifinals begin!

35
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,708
Wizard King, sir. You're
not going to stop them?

36
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:02,916
If this were an actual battle,
no one would be able

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,541
to control when the
fighting begins or ends.

38
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,041
[NARRATOR] Langris's sudden,
violent outburst forced

39
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:11,625
Teams B and G into an
impromptu semifinal faceoff.

40
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:14,291
But part of Julius's
plan for this test

41
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:16,541
was to expose an
"involuntary" traitor

42
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:19,583
working on behalf of the
Eye of the Midnight Sun.

[NARRATOR]
In order to subdue Langris,

45
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:27,333
Asta called upon
his Black Asta form.

46
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:29,291
How about some help, Xerx?

47
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,875
[NARRATOR]
Focusing his might,

48
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:34,708
he put his trust in
the mage called Xerx.

That's my duty
as a Magic Knight!

[NARRATOR] Zora's father
Zara was the first commoner

57
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:52,583
to become a Magic Knight.

58
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:54,375
however, he was
eventually betrayed

59

You jerks.

My father knew what
a knight should be.

Casting a spell like
that over his own body--

that'll be a constant
drain of power!

That was a fla- <i>ha</i> wless defeat!

00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,833
[ZORA] I see. As long as
you've got the advantage,

195
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:28,416
that means you're always
in the right, does it?

by a commoner, I guess
that puts you in the wrong.

Anyway, after that

So scared of Portal-boy

Must've been nice
to kick back huh?

Listen, there's no
reason for you

to what's best for the
given circumstances.

225

But you'd better be careful--

don't throw thinking
out the window entirely

in a draw between

240

the Black Bulls giving

the vice captain
of the Golden Dawn

243
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:59,333

a pretty big impression!

Which is why

245
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:03,750

and wake up soon!

against the captain

of the Aqua Deer.

265
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:55,041
He'd just counter every attack
with its direct weakness.

266
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:56,583
What to do?

267
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:58,916
I think I might
have a good strategy.

268

Wanna hear it?

269
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:06,708

what kind of masterpiece

[NILS, RUBEN] If we provide
enough backup, we might win!

Huh? That magic...

273
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:21,875
Someone's condensing it
and making it more refined!

274
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:27,833
[LUCK]
There's no point in countering

275

an ultra-fast attack spell.

276
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:31,791
One strike and he's toast!

277
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,750
[LUCK] I guess we're kind of
copying the Combo spells

278
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:39,125
those other guys were
using in the first round.

279
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,916
But I betcha this
technique is gonna have

280
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,750
a lot more oomph to it!

281
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,041
That looks bad!

282
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:46,875
We've got to get our
team's crystal to safety!

moving out of the way.

I'll always know exactly
where you're hiding.

[RILL] Oh, wow. I'm sure
it travels really fast!

Better get to drawing, then!

288
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:08,750

is, it won't help you at all!

a little inspiration

295
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:36,625
from the first round, myself!

296
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:39,333
The method's not quite the same,

297
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:42,750
but I'm still charging
up the enemy's spell...

my great masterpiece! Woo-hoo!

Oh, boy. That didn't
last very long.

so tremendously far

in this selection exam.

312
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:30,291
I'll be writing all of
this down in my diary.

It's Asta. He's
severely exhausted now.

We took him to the
infirmary downstairs.

Please be here for
Noelle in my stead.

[EMCEE MAGE]
The next matchup is Team M:

321
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:50,958
Ben, Brad, and Eric vs.

322
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:53,541
Team P: En, Noelle, and Yuno.

323
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:56,916
Stand by for round
two, match four!

324
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,375
[NOELLE]
This is for Asta.

325
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:00,291
Uh, I'm gonna fight
for everyone who's lost

326
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:03,666
and definitely not
one specific person!

327
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,625
Of course, we are.

328
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:07,750
And we're going to win.

Round two, match four, begin!

[NOELLE gasps]

331

Hey! Don't just go without me!

332
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:26,750
[YUNO] I refuse to waste
my time standing still.

333
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:27,833
There they are!

334
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:28,833
Just him?

335
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:30,666
Who is this guy?

336
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,333
Begone!

00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:38,791

But, he's nothing
but a commoner!

340
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:51,166
[YUNO] Asta, you may be down,
but you'll get back up.

341
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,875
I've seen how quickly
you adapt and improve.

342
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:56,625
The more it hurts, the
further you push yourself.

343
00:19:56,708 --> 00:20:00,458
Soon you'll be countless times
stronger than you are now.

Uh, crystal destroyed!

00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,000
Team P wins!

347
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:17,208
What did he just do? And how?

348
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:20,333
Oh, man! That spell
was pretty damn sweet!

349
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:22,708
Yeah, I wish I could
fight him, too!

[sighs]

351
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:29,333
[JULIUS]
Yuno, I can see that you've got

352
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:31,208
much more to show us.

353
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,791
Yuno!

354
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:36,875
What's your problem, finishing
them all off by yourself?

355
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:39,541
I wish you'd use my power
every once in a while!

356
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:42,333
My talents are wasted on you!

357
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:43,875
Shut up.

358
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:46,208
Ugh, you sure stress me out!

359
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:48,291
I don't hate that
about you, though.

360
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,916
Next up, match two
of the semifinals.

361
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,250
But it will be much
more than that.

362
00:20:58,333 --> 00:20:59,916
Since the first
match of this round

363
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,083
resulted in a draw,

364
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:03,541
this face-off between
Team I and Team P

365
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:07,416
is going to be the last bout
of our great tournament!

Okay, so my name
is actually Zora,

00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:00,666
and my dad's name was Zara.

What? That's too simple?

372
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:06,083
I think it makes it extra
clear that we're related.

373
00:23:06,166 --> 00:23:09,666
Yeah, I agree! Imagine
if I was a quintuplet.
