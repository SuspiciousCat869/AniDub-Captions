[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:18,833
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:24,583
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:35,666
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,958
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

home to Rebecca and
her younger siblings.

Coincidentally, Gauche's

a strange tragedy befell Nean.

What?

20
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,208
There's snow everywhere.

00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:17,750
Where'd it all come from?
It's not even winter yet.

22
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:19,166
Hey! Stop it!

23
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,750
What are you doing out here?

24
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:22,916
It's the children.
They're missing!

No.

[NEIGE]
How exciting.

27
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:34,500
I just love making new friends.

00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:08,958
Where are they?

00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:11,416
Why would they
run off at this hour?

Not playing hide and
seek, I'm guessing.

I will never allow you

Come on, Gauche,
this is so not the time.

38
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:26,458
There is nothing in this world

with this village?

00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,416
I mean, snow?
At this time of year?

44
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,083
That is just absurd.

45
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:42,250
Hey, Noelle, what are
you doing in Nean?

46
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:44,625
Uh. Just passing through,
seeing the sights,

that sort of thing, you know.

48
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:48,458
Asta, who is this?

49
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:50,291
[ASTA]
A friend from the Magic Knights.

my friend, Rebecca.

Uh.

What's wrong?

00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:59,333
Oh, it's nothing.

Hey, listen.

57
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,958
A little while ago,
I saw a bunch of kids

58
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:06,791
headed toward the mountains.
What was that about?

59
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:09,375
Is there some kind of
late-night festival?

60
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,250
The kids!

61
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,333

[SISTER THERESA]
This snow isn't natural.

67
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:24,250
I can sense some
kind of spell in it.

68
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,791
One that controls people.

69
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:29,750
But only children whose
magic has not yet developed.

70

[ALL gasp]

71
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:33,833
Several of ours have
disappeared as well.

Stop, please!

So quick to resort to violence.

You truly are hopeless.
You can hit me if you want to,

with Transmission magic,

the mana in the mirror,

He said it would protect me
from magic a little bit.

162
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:28,000
Think of it as your big brother
when I'm not there.

163
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:30,125
[MARIE]
That's why I'm awake.

164
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:31,125
[NEIGE]
Hm?

165
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:31,875
[MARIE gasps]

166
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:33,083
Oh, dear.

167
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:36,000
My spell's worn off
this one. Why is that?

168
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:38,625
--[MARIE whimpers]
--It's too bad, really.

169
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:41,041
If I can't use my magic
to make you a good girl,

170
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:42,583
we can't be friends.

171
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,666
You want to be my friend, right?

172
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,416
No, not that way.

173
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,416
You shouldn't use spells to
make people do what you want.

174
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,416
If you do that, you're
not a real friend at all.

175
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,833
[NEIGE gasps]
You don't belong here,

176
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:56,958
you horrible little monster.

177
00:08:57,041 --> 00:09:00,000
No friend of mine would ever
say something like that!

178
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,166
[panting]

179
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,791
Now, now. Don't lose
your temper, Neige.

180
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:10,208
We don't wanna damage
the merchandise.

181
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:12,916
Do I have to do all
your thinking for you?

182
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,333
No, please! I'm sorry!

183
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:21,375
[BARO chuckles]
This one's our star.

184
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,791
Lotta power for a kid.

185
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:27,541
[BARO] Any more like her
and we'll be rich men

186
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:30,458
by the time we're done.

187
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:33,958
That kid hardly has any magic.

188
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,833
I told you to get the
ones who were loaded,

189
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:38,458
and this is what you
bring me? Really?

190
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:40,750
I'm sorry, Baro.

191
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:43,916
We don't need this
trash. Bye, kid.

192
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:53,583
[BARO]
Hmph. Brother or not,

193
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:56,916
keep wastin' my time
and I'll kill you.

194
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,583
Now, then.

195
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:01,625
Time to start
extracting some magic.

196

[BARO cackles]

197
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:13,541
She's nearby. The mana
feels stronger here.

198
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,375
Okay!

199
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:18,083
Whoever's behind this
has a good deal of power.

200
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:20,291
We have to keep our guards up.

201
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,291
Please, Marie. Hold on!

202
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:24,958
[ASTA] We're comin',
kids. Hang in there!

203
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,500
Now, everyone, please stay calm.

204
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:39,291
The Magic Knights will
find your children

205
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:40,791
and bring them home safely.

206

[VILLAGER 31A]
Whoa!

207
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,416
[VILLAGER 31B]
Get a look at her robe!

208
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,916
Are they really going to
bring my son back to me?

209
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,666
Where are Marco and Luca?

210
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,041
What's going on?

211
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,541
I'm sorry, Pim.

212
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:51,750
It's all right.

213
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:54,666
Asta will bring them
back, I promise you.

214
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,958
Yes, they'll be home
before you know it.

215

'Kay. But what
happened to our house?

[NOELLE] Uh... Yeah, that's
another thing silly Asta

217
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:04,250
will be taking care of.

218
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:07,208
For now, let's just patch it up
the best we can okay?

219
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,750
[PIM]
It's gonna be freezing in there.

220
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:13,458
Right. I need to contact
the other knights.

221
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:17,375
[yawns]

222
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:20,541
Huh? Hello there.
Knights Headquarters here.

223
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:22,958
[NOELLE]
Hey, I recognize you.

224
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:24,958
They have you working
at Headquarters?

225
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:26,375
Ha, ha!

226
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:28,916
Captain Jack stationed me here
to help out temporarily,

227
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,833
but I'm not gonna be a full-time
paper pusher or anything.

228
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:34,416
I've just accomplished
so much in my short time

229
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,208
with the Praying Mantises
that I've earned myself

230
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,416
a little break from battle,
you see. Ha, ha!

231
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,375
We've got an emergency,
here, you babbling idiot!

232
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:44,000
Listen! There's snow
falling in Nean.

233
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,791
Really? How romantic!

234
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:48,291
Do you understand
the word "emergency"?

235
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,458
Somebody used magic to
make it snow so they could

236
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:52,250
abduct children
from the village!

237
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:53,708
Wait, huh?

238
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:55,666
You should tell the
Magic Knights right away.

239
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,125
What do you think
I'm doing now?

240
00:11:57,208 --> 00:12:00,041
[SEKKE]
Ha, ha! Right, well don't worry.

241
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:02,791
Sekke is on the case. Ha, ha!

242
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,208
I don't find that
reassuring. Idiot.

243
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:17,166
I'm picking up mana over there.

244
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,458
Yes, that's it!

245
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:20,083
The caves would be
a perfect place

246
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:22,750
to keep all of
the children hidden.

Hang on, Gauche!

00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:27,583
Can you set me down
over there for a sec?

Leave him.

one who matters.

Ah!

Asta!

257
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,625
And you're a Magic Knight?

258
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,791
Don't they have
standards anymore?

259
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:52,166
I couldn't care less what
happens to anybody else.

260
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,541
As long as Marie stays safe.

261
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:58,333
[GAUCHE] Just like the captain
told me the day I cast aside

262
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:02,166
my prisoner's clothing
and joined the Black Bulls.

263

[YAMI]
I won't stop you.

264
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:07,291
Go on and protect whatever
you think needs protecting.

265
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:09,708
And that's just
what I'm gonna do.

Stay with us. The poor thing.

and frostbitten, too.

Marco, can you hear me?

270
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:23,833
It's no use. He's in
some kind of trance.

00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:28,416
[ASTA]
All right. Just leave it to me!

Just wear that and you'll forget
all about being scared.
