The Clover Kingdom.

00:00:24,014 --> 00:00:26,391
In this place where
magic is everything,

3
00:00:26,474 --> 00:00:29,352
there lives one boy
who was born without it.

4
00:00:29,436 --> 00:00:31,855
His name is Asta.

5
00:00:33,064 --> 00:00:34,441
[NARRATOR]
His strength and determination

6
00:00:34,524 --> 00:00:36,776
helped him become
a Magic Knight.

7
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,446
And despite the many
challenges he faces,

8
00:00:39,529 --> 00:00:43,116
he aims for the top
and refuses to give up!

00:00:43,199 --> 00:00:44,826
Rich or poor,

10

royalty or commoner,

11
00:00:46,995 --> 00:00:49,831
Asta believes anyone can shine.

12
00:00:49,914 --> 00:00:52,876
His mission is to prove
that to the whole world

13
00:00:52,959 --> 00:00:55,879
and to become the
next Wizard King!

[YAMI yawns]

Do you really have to be so
loud this early in the day?

26
00:03:06,885 --> 00:03:10,388
The noise really puts a
damper on my morning dump.

27
00:03:11,723 --> 00:03:16,311
[YAMI] Quit messin' around with
my pets and let's head out!

somewhere, Captain?

29
00:03:18,772 --> 00:03:20,231
Yeah.

30
00:03:20,315 --> 00:03:22,275
We're supposed to be learnin'
about the devils, remember?

31
00:03:22,359 --> 00:03:25,695
We'll start with the curse,
the one that they call "weg."

32
00:03:25,779 --> 00:03:28,490
That should give us a
couple of clues to go on.

34

[CHARLOTTE]
Please forgive me, Sol.

37
00:03:43,546 --> 00:03:46,883
I let that elf
take over my body.

38
00:03:46,966 --> 00:03:50,595
Let my squad down.
I failed as a captain.

39
00:03:50,679 --> 00:03:52,514
No, Char!

40
00:03:52,597 --> 00:03:55,058
None of what happened
was your fault!

41
00:03:55,141 --> 00:03:58,228
I may not have been possessed,
but I still couldn't fix it!

42
00:03:58,311 --> 00:04:00,480
As much as I hate to admit it,
the Black Bulls captain

43
00:04:00,563 --> 00:04:02,482
really saved our skin.

44
00:04:02,565 --> 00:04:06,152
Yami saved us? My goodness.

45
00:04:06,236 --> 00:04:07,987
By the way, don't
call me "Char."

46
00:04:08,071 --> 00:04:10,323
As I keep telling
you, it's Captain.

[SOL]
You got it, Char.

48
00:04:11,991 --> 00:04:14,119
And yeah, he did
a really good job,

49
00:04:14,202 --> 00:04:16,830
so I guess he isn't all
that bad, for a man.

50
00:04:16,913 --> 00:04:18,665
He's still gross!

51
00:04:18,748 --> 00:04:21,459
Besides, you could
kick his butt any day.

52
00:04:27,757 --> 00:04:28,925
[CHARLOTTE]
Wait a minute.

53
00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:31,428
This means that I didn't
dream all those things!

54
00:04:31,511 --> 00:04:34,389
They actually happened
while I was possessed!

55
00:04:34,472 --> 00:04:37,225
[CHARLOTTE]
You did well, human.

56
00:04:37,308 --> 00:04:40,353
[CHARLOTTE] In my memories,
Yami was so close to me.

57
00:04:40,437 --> 00:04:43,732
I can't believe
all that was real!

[CHARLOTTE gasps]

59
00:04:46,609 --> 00:04:50,739
But I enjoyed fighting
with you, Yami Sukehiro.

60
00:04:50,822 --> 00:04:51,990
Well, look at you, Charla,

61
00:04:52,073 --> 00:04:54,075
turnin' all nice and
honest at the end.

62
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:55,702
That's sweet.

63
00:04:58,204 --> 00:05:00,749
I admit I may be
a little awkward,

64
00:05:00,832 --> 00:05:03,918
but not as awkward as she is.

65
00:05:04,002 --> 00:05:05,378
[CHARLOTTE]
The details are a little fuzzy

66
00:05:05,462 --> 00:05:07,589
when I look back on it,
but I'm fairly certain

67
00:05:07,672 --> 00:05:09,883
it went something like that.

68
00:05:09,966 --> 00:05:11,468
Oh, dear.

69
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:14,596
Does that mean that Yami already
knows about my feelings for him?

70
00:05:14,679 --> 00:05:17,015
No! That can't be true!

71
00:05:17,098 --> 00:05:18,975
[SOL]
Uh, Char? Heads up.

[CHARLOTTE]
No!

00:05:56,096 --> 00:05:58,556
I do not have the mental
or emotional capacity

86
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,600
to be around him right now!

87
00:06:00,684 --> 00:06:05,397
Sol! Get rid of him
like you normally would!

Uh. Oh, crap, what should I do?

00:06:07,982 --> 00:06:10,485
I guess the guy did save
your life and all that.

00:06:10,568 --> 00:06:12,654

him off this time?

00:17:08,435 --> 00:17:10,228
I can't get the right
words to come out!

At this rate, he'll completely
misunderstand what I mean!

322
00:17:13,314 --> 00:17:15,525
Eh, I'm not so sure,
Captain Yami.

323
00:17:15,608 --> 00:17:18,820
It doesn't seem to me
like she hates you.

324
00:17:18,903 --> 00:17:21,031
I don't recall asking your
opinion on the matter,

Mr. Suspended Sentence.

326
00:17:24,659 --> 00:17:27,120
Look, the way that
she's acting right now,

327
00:17:27,203 --> 00:17:29,205
it kinda reminds me of Noelle!

328
00:17:29,289 --> 00:17:30,790
[YAMI]
Huh?

329
00:17:30,874 --> 00:17:33,626
Which means, she doesn't hate
you, she just really trusts you.

330
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,503
I think! And that
makes it harder

331
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:38,798
for her to be honest
about her feelings!

332

[ASTA] I learned that,
too, a while back.

Let me get this straight.

334
00:17:45,013 --> 00:17:47,098
So, you figured out that
Noelle trusts you or whatever,

335
00:17:47,182 --> 00:17:48,892
and it didn't change
anything for you?

336
00:17:48,975 --> 00:17:50,602
Shouldn't you be embarrassed?

337

Nope, not one bit!

a lot of tough
situations together! Yeah.

340
00:17:57,067 --> 00:17:58,693
Noelle's a complicated girl.

But hey, we make it work.

Don't worry, Captain!

344
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,367
Just because you have trouble
expressing your feelings

345
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:06,993
doesn't mean you're
a failure or anything.

with some insightful
subordinates.

Nah, that one's less of
a blessing and more of a curse.

You said you wanted to
discuss something, right?

00:18:42,529 --> 00:18:45,782
So, perhaps we could
talk over dinner?

I do feel kinda bad
for Char, though,

00:19:40,837 --> 00:19:44,591
since she didn't get a chance
to say how she feels.

Wait a minute. Is that all?

[CHARLOTTE] Curse you
for getting my hopes up!

00:19:53,099 --> 00:19:54,768
Sorry. I'm only asking

386
00:19:54,851 --> 00:19:56,853
because the Wizard King
ordered me and the Black Bulls

387
00:19:56,936 --> 00:20:00,231
to conduct an investigation
into the ways of the devils.

See, the kid's in a
little bit of hot water,

is just itching to
execute him for it.

00:20:07,781 --> 00:20:10,700
And since I'm his captain,
I'm doing whatever I can

392
00:20:10,784 --> 00:20:14,245
to clear his name.

393
00:20:14,329 --> 00:20:16,331
[CHARLOTTE] It started when
a powerful curse mage,

394
00:20:16,414 --> 00:20:19,000
who held a deep-seated
grudge against my family,

395
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:21,419
decided to cast a deadly spell.

396
00:20:21,503 --> 00:20:23,463
Its effect was like
nothing in this kingdom,

397
00:20:23,546 --> 00:20:26,466
and breaking it was impossible.

398

Forbidden magic

even the shape of the world.

400
00:20:31,137 --> 00:20:34,933
The curse activated when
I was 18 years old.

401
00:20:35,016 --> 00:20:37,435
It not only affected
the quality of my magic,

402
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:40,105
but it altered my very soul.

403
00:20:40,188 --> 00:20:41,981
It's extremely likely
that this curse

404
00:20:42,065 --> 00:20:45,735
used power from another realm.

00:20:45,819 --> 00:20:48,571
[YAMI]
Ah, I thought as much.

406
00:20:48,655 --> 00:20:51,574
However, there's still
a lot that I don't know.

407

Fair enough. Thanks.

about forbidden curses...
