1
00:00:23,805 --> 00:00:25,682
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:25,765 --> 00:00:28,601
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:32,105 --> 00:00:34,441
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:34,524 --> 00:00:36,985
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:43,533 --> 00:00:45,660
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:45,744 --> 00:00:49,706
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:51,207 --> 00:00:53,001
[DOROTHY]
You're in the Glamour World now.

8
00:00:53,084 --> 00:00:57,422
In this place, the
impossible becomes real.

9
00:00:57,505 --> 00:01:00,050
[NARRATOR] Vanessa, Sally,
Magna, Luck, and Charmy

10
00:01:00,133 --> 00:01:02,218
had been taken to
a world of fantasy,

11
00:01:02,302 --> 00:01:05,180
where they matched wits
with Dorothy's elven form.

12
00:01:05,263 --> 00:01:06,306
[MAGNA, LUCK]
Combo Spell:

13
00:01:06,389 --> 00:01:09,476
Flame Lightning
Exploding Cannon!

14
00:01:09,559 --> 00:01:11,478
[NARRATOR] Working together,
the team managed

15
00:01:11,561 --> 00:01:15,190
to defeat her and escape
the treacherous Glamour World.

16
00:01:15,273 --> 00:01:18,735
[MARIE, GAUCHE]
Combo Spell: Reflect Iris.

17
00:01:18,818 --> 00:01:21,071
[gasps]

18
00:01:21,154 --> 00:01:22,322
[GREY]
Why can't I move?

19
00:01:22,405 --> 00:01:23,698
[GORDON]
We're stuck!

20
00:01:23,782 --> 00:01:25,617
There's no hope for you.

21
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,869
Now die, helpless worms.

22
00:01:28,912 --> 00:01:31,498
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
Asta and the other Black Bulls

23
00:01:31,581 --> 00:01:34,042
were fighting a possessed
Gauche and Marie

24
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:36,336
when Henry attempted
a risky move.

25
00:01:36,419 --> 00:01:37,253
[HENRY]
Now...

26
00:01:37,337 --> 00:01:39,798
[HENRY]
It's... your... turn!

27
00:01:39,881 --> 00:01:43,927
You're not even close
to done, Henry! Don't die!

28
00:01:46,137 --> 00:01:47,555
[HENRY]
I don't wanna die!

29
00:01:47,639 --> 00:01:49,641
I want to live on
with my friends!

30
00:01:49,724 --> 00:01:51,768
Please don't go! We'll miss you!

31
00:01:51,851 --> 00:01:56,022
[GREY] I don't wanna lose a
single one of my dear friends!

32
00:01:56,106 --> 00:01:58,441
[ASTA]
That goes for you, too!

33
00:01:59,859 --> 00:02:02,237
[ASTA]
Do you hear me, Gauche?

34
00:02:03,697 --> 00:02:05,156
That's enough.

35
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,702
Give those bodies back to
Gauche and Marie right now.

36
00:02:08,785 --> 00:02:11,121
[NARRATOR] Asta was able
to expel the elven spirits

37
00:02:11,204 --> 00:02:15,417
from Gauche and Marie, and
the two returned to normal.

38
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,420
Thanks for saving us.
Buncha jerks.

39
00:02:18,503 --> 00:02:19,713
All right!

40
00:02:19,796 --> 00:02:22,340
The rest of the Black Bulls
are back together!

41
00:02:22,424 --> 00:02:25,427
Once we recharge,
we'll go help the captain!

42
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,345
[ALL]
Yeah!

43
00:04:02,482 --> 00:04:05,318
[GUELDRE] Ah, this must
be the Shadow Palace.

44
00:04:05,402 --> 00:04:06,820
You know what that is?

45
00:04:06,903 --> 00:04:10,532
Yes, I do. An ancient
Spatial Magic construct.

46
00:04:10,615 --> 00:04:13,368
Who would have guessed
that it actually existed?

47
00:04:13,451 --> 00:04:15,161
Rumor has it, if you
can make it inside,

48
00:04:15,245 --> 00:04:17,414
you'll find all manner
of powerful magic items

49
00:04:17,497 --> 00:04:20,083
and priceless treasures
free for the taking!

50
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:23,003
[REVCHI] So, what's our
strategy going to be?

51
00:04:23,086 --> 00:04:25,213
[GUELDRE]
That's a good question.

52
00:04:28,299 --> 00:04:31,803
[CHARMY] Eat up! Don't let
a single crumb go to waste!

53
00:04:43,481 --> 00:04:45,316
[CHARMY] Captain Yami
and the Mantis guy already

54
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,610
went in, but I bet there're
some super-tough enemies

55
00:04:47,694 --> 00:04:49,654
in there, so let's make sure
we're nice and nourished

56
00:04:49,738 --> 00:04:52,657
before we go help 'em!
Chow down, people!

57
00:04:52,741 --> 00:04:55,243
Here, Marie. Ready? Ah.

58
00:04:55,326 --> 00:04:57,454
Um, could you
please not do that?

59
00:04:57,537 --> 00:04:59,039
There's no need
to be shy around me,

60
00:04:59,122 --> 00:05:02,208
my darling goddess! Ah!

61
00:05:02,292 --> 00:05:05,170
I told you to cut it out!

62
00:05:05,253 --> 00:05:06,713
Have a bite, Gauche.

63
00:05:06,796 --> 00:05:11,426
There's no need to be shy
around me, either. Ah.

64
00:05:11,509 --> 00:05:14,054
Ah, yes, my beautiful magic
is being replenished,

65
00:05:14,137 --> 00:05:15,805
bit by impeccable bit!

66
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:17,140
This is great!

67
00:05:17,223 --> 00:05:19,726
That healing magic of yours
made me good as new!

68
00:05:19,809 --> 00:05:21,811
Thank you so much, Mimosa!

69
00:05:21,895 --> 00:05:22,896
Don't worry about it.

70
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:25,106
I'm just happy I could
be of some help.

71
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:28,151
Now I'll be able to bust
out my dark form again!

72
00:05:28,234 --> 00:05:30,612
[NOELLE] Here. You'd better
eat something, too.

73
00:05:30,695 --> 00:05:33,114
Thanks, I appreciate it.

74
00:05:33,198 --> 00:05:36,743
[NOELLE] Typical Asta.
You always overdo it.

75
00:05:36,826 --> 00:05:39,579
I swear, you'd be hopeless
without me here to help you.

76
00:05:39,662 --> 00:05:42,123
[gasps] I mean,
you're still hopeless

77
00:05:42,207 --> 00:05:43,625
whether I'm around or not!

78
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:45,502
So you'd better not
read into that!

79
00:05:45,585 --> 00:05:47,671
I can't help but read into it!

80
00:05:47,754 --> 00:05:48,838
Huh?

81
00:05:48,922 --> 00:05:51,174
[SALLY] Asta, make sure
you take good care

82
00:05:51,257 --> 00:05:54,511
of that unique body!

83
00:05:54,594 --> 00:05:57,597
Hey, wait a second, why are
you wearing his clothes?

84
00:05:57,681 --> 00:05:59,391
[SALLY]
Why is it a big deal?

85
00:05:59,474 --> 00:06:02,977
Oh, yeah, hers got kinda ripped,
so I let her borrow mine.

86
00:06:03,061 --> 00:06:05,188
And how exactly did that happen?

87
00:06:05,271 --> 00:06:07,273
Whatever, just tell me
why you're all buddy-buddy

88
00:06:07,357 --> 00:06:09,234
with one of our worst enemies!

89
00:06:09,317 --> 00:06:12,153
You're askin' me this now?

90
00:06:12,237 --> 00:06:14,364
Because Asta promised me that,
if I fought on your side,

91
00:06:14,447 --> 00:06:15,740
he would let me
do whatever I want

92
00:06:15,824 --> 00:06:17,909
to his body after
the big battle's over!

93
00:06:17,992 --> 00:06:19,327
Whoa! Whoa!

94
00:06:19,411 --> 00:06:20,537
Excuse me?!

95
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,288
Do whatever you want?!

96
00:06:22,372 --> 00:06:24,207
That wasn't what I said at all!

97
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:26,042
Eh, close enough!

98
00:06:26,126 --> 00:06:28,336
I promise you
I'll use anesthesia!

99
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,379
Will you, though?

100
00:06:29,462 --> 00:06:31,214
What's wrong with you, Asta?

101
00:06:31,297 --> 00:06:34,551
She's our enemy!
You're so stupid!

102
00:06:34,634 --> 00:06:35,844
[ASTA]
But--!

103
00:06:35,927 --> 00:06:37,178
I don't know what's
going on between you two,

104
00:06:37,262 --> 00:06:39,431
but please step aside
so I can heal him!

105
00:06:39,514 --> 00:06:42,225
I thought you already
finished doing that.

106
00:06:42,308 --> 00:06:45,603
You're unbelievable. Take that!

107
00:06:45,687 --> 00:06:46,980
Aw, c'mon!

108
00:06:47,063 --> 00:06:48,815
I hate to interrupt ya,

109
00:06:48,898 --> 00:06:50,650
but don't you think you
should eat somethin', too,

110
00:06:50,734 --> 00:06:52,152
so your mana comes back?

111
00:06:52,235 --> 00:06:54,070
Did I ask for your opinion?

112
00:06:54,154 --> 00:06:55,822
Hey, I outrank you!

113
00:06:55,905 --> 00:06:58,700
And I'm royalty.
That's all that matters.

114
00:06:58,783 --> 00:07:00,577
[MAGNA]
Uh-huh, I'm still your superior!

115
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,662
[laughs]

116
00:07:05,623 --> 00:07:06,875
What's the matter?

117
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:08,251
They're here.

118
00:07:08,335 --> 00:07:09,252
[gasps]

119
00:07:09,336 --> 00:07:10,670
[LUCK]
I see two.

120
00:07:12,547 --> 00:07:13,757
Gotcha now!

121
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,133
You're dead!

122
00:07:16,384 --> 00:07:17,594

[ASTA, VANESSA, MAGNA gasp]

[BOTH yelp]

125
00:07:28,772 --> 00:07:31,691
I see you're awake. About time!

126
00:07:31,775 --> 00:07:35,195
Sorry to keep you
waiting, dear sister.

127
00:07:35,278 --> 00:07:37,447
They're here!

128
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:41,534
Captain Fuegoleon and
Captain Mereoleona!

129
00:07:41,618 --> 00:07:43,912
Wow, Captain Fuegoleon!

130
00:07:43,995 --> 00:07:46,623
You didn't die or anything.
That's awesome!

131
00:07:46,706 --> 00:07:49,626
And you've got Salamander, too!

132
00:07:49,709 --> 00:07:51,002
Yes, Asta.

133
00:07:51,086 --> 00:07:52,921
It would appear that you've
gotten much stronger

134
00:07:53,004 --> 00:07:54,214
during my slumber.

135
00:07:54,297 --> 00:07:57,258
You know it! I'm totally buff!

136
00:07:57,342 --> 00:07:58,718
And, Captain Mereoleona.

137
00:07:58,802 --> 00:08:01,971
Weren't you supposed to rest
for at least one more day?

138
00:08:02,055 --> 00:08:04,224
Don't need to. I'm not weak!

139
00:08:04,307 --> 00:08:05,725
Yeah, but--!

140
00:08:05,809 --> 00:08:08,269
That woman is unstoppable.

141
00:08:10,397 --> 00:08:12,565
[NOZEL] So, they're finally
back in the fray?

142
00:08:12,649 --> 00:08:14,526
Took them long enough.

143
00:08:14,609 --> 00:08:16,361
[PAPLO]
Lord Nozel is amazing!

144
00:08:16,444 --> 00:08:17,904
I can't believe he's
already recovered

145
00:08:17,987 --> 00:08:20,448
from such a serious injury!

146
00:08:21,616 --> 00:08:24,411
Am I late? I'm sorry.

147
00:08:24,494 --> 00:08:27,789
Huh. Then try to make
up for it in battle.

148
00:08:27,872 --> 00:08:32,002
Even with Salamander's help,
you won't outdo me.

149
00:08:32,085 --> 00:08:34,295
Hey, guys! Look!

150
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:38,883
Am I seein' things here,
or is that hole gettin' smaller?

151
00:08:38,967 --> 00:08:41,970
You're right, it is!
We should hurry!

152
00:08:42,053 --> 00:08:44,931
[BAVAL] When we place the final
magic stone into its pedestal

153
00:08:45,015 --> 00:08:47,892
inside the palace, the
elves' great reincarnation

154
00:08:47,976 --> 00:08:49,436
will be complete!

155
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,480
Of course, a price must be paid
for our use of these bodies.

156
00:08:52,564 --> 00:08:56,735
Sadly, their human souls will
be sent to the underworld!

There's not much time!

[ALL gasp]

00:09:02,907 --> 00:09:05,702
You will pay for your insolence.

160
00:09:05,785 --> 00:09:07,537
I'll see to that!

161
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,206
[ZORA]
The Golden Dawn's best guys?

162
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:11,875
We can't catch a break.

163
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:14,878
While my gorgeousness
has no limits,

164
00:09:14,961 --> 00:09:17,130
unfortunately, my magic
has a maximum,

165
00:09:17,213 --> 00:09:19,466
and I've just about reached it.

166
00:09:19,549 --> 00:09:21,134
[MEREOLEONA]
We need to move.

167
00:09:21,217 --> 00:09:24,679
But... with these numbers...

168
00:09:24,763 --> 00:09:27,974
[VANESSA]
I say the captains go inside!

169
00:09:28,058 --> 00:09:30,018
Let the Black Bulls
take care of everything

170
00:09:30,101 --> 00:09:31,353
here on the ground!

171
00:09:31,436 --> 00:09:33,271
With my Thread Magic
and Charmy's cooking,

172
00:09:33,355 --> 00:09:34,731
we'll all be fine!

173
00:09:34,814 --> 00:09:36,775
You can count on us!

174
00:09:36,858 --> 00:09:40,320
Hey, Asta! You should
go in with 'em!

175
00:09:40,403 --> 00:09:41,738
They're gonna need
your sword if they

176
00:09:41,821 --> 00:09:45,700
have to change somebody
back, don't ya think?

177
00:09:45,784 --> 00:09:49,746
Okay! I'll go! Do your
best, Black Bulls!

178
00:09:49,829 --> 00:09:51,915
Roger!

179
00:09:51,998 --> 00:09:53,833
[MAGNA] Some of these bozos
down here still think

180
00:09:53,917 --> 00:09:56,961
they're elves though, so try
to make it quick, all right?

181
00:09:57,045 --> 00:09:58,338
You got it!

182
00:09:58,421 --> 00:10:00,256
Wait, I'll go in
with you, Asta--!

183
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:03,259
[KIRSCH] They'll also need
someone who can heal!

184
00:10:03,343 --> 00:10:04,886
Go with them, Mimosa.

185
00:10:04,969 --> 00:10:06,971
Don't worry, I'll provide
my beautiful support

186
00:10:07,055 --> 00:10:08,431
to our comrades here!

187
00:10:08,515 --> 00:10:09,766
Okay!

188
00:10:09,849 --> 00:10:11,768
[MIMOSA]
That way I can protect Asta.

189
00:10:11,851 --> 00:10:14,646
My brother actually said
something smart for once!

190
00:10:14,729 --> 00:10:15,855
But wait! I can--!

191
00:10:15,939 --> 00:10:17,565
[SOLID]
Noelle!

192
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,652
[NOELLE]
Is that Solid?

193
00:10:20,735 --> 00:10:22,529
[SOLID]
You go, too!

194
00:10:22,612 --> 00:10:23,738
[gasps]

195
00:10:23,822 --> 00:10:26,991
I hate to say this,
but for right now,

196
00:10:27,075 --> 00:10:28,535
you're stronger than me!

197
00:10:28,618 --> 00:10:30,036
[gasps]

198
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,579
So enjoy it while you can,

199
00:10:31,663 --> 00:10:34,165
because I will
surpass you again.

200
00:10:34,249 --> 00:10:38,628
I'm your older
brother! I have to!

201
00:10:38,712 --> 00:10:42,632
Now, hurry, and make
certain you come back!

202
00:10:42,716 --> 00:10:48,388
Remember. Our family's
pride is at stake!

203
00:10:48,471 --> 00:10:51,474
Understood. I promise
I'll come back.

204
00:10:51,558 --> 00:10:53,268
Thank you, Solid!

205
00:10:53,351 --> 00:10:55,020
Well then, shall we?

206
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:57,188
Don't fall behind us!

207
00:11:02,986 --> 00:11:04,029
Well?

208
00:11:04,112 --> 00:11:06,239
You won't get past us!

209
00:11:06,322 --> 00:11:08,742
[BLACK BULLS]
You're in their way!

210
00:11:14,539 --> 00:11:18,668
[ASTA] Here we go!
Into the Shadow Palace!

211
00:11:34,392 --> 00:11:35,477
[gasps]

212
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:40,023
[ASTA yelps]
This is freaky!

213
00:11:40,106 --> 00:11:41,775
[ALL gasp]

214
00:11:41,858 --> 00:11:43,860
Oh, boy, here we go--!

215
00:11:46,863 --> 00:11:48,782
[ASTA]
Why are we floating?

216
00:11:48,865 --> 00:11:52,786
I assume this is a way
of dealing with intruders.

217
00:11:52,869 --> 00:11:56,039
This mana we're swimming
in certainly is unusual!

218
00:11:56,122 --> 00:11:58,541
I can't control
my magic in here!

219
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:00,293
The Shadow Palace.

220
00:12:00,377 --> 00:12:04,005
I hear it's the boundary
between this world and the next.

221
00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:05,924
Whoa! Are we gonna die?

222
00:12:06,007 --> 00:12:07,342
Is that you trying to be funny,

223
00:12:07,425 --> 00:12:10,762
because I am not
laughing! Just shut up!

224
00:12:10,845 --> 00:12:14,432
[ASTA]
I refuse to die!

225
00:12:17,727 --> 00:12:19,854
[MIMOSA screams]

226
00:12:19,938 --> 00:12:21,231
Hey, wai--!

227
00:12:25,068 --> 00:12:28,697
Are you hurt, Asta?
Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry!

228
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:31,282
Don't worry, I'll
heal you right away!

229
00:12:31,366 --> 00:12:35,954
Plant Recovery Magic:
Princess-Healing Flower Robe!

230
00:12:37,872 --> 00:12:40,500
[MIMOSA]
So we're inside the palace now?

231
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:42,752
Where did everyone else go?

232
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:46,172
Sweet, I'm healed up!

233
00:12:46,256 --> 00:12:48,591
It's almost like
nothing ever happened!

234
00:12:48,675 --> 00:12:50,301
Thanks, Mimosa!

235
00:12:51,511 --> 00:12:53,638
Now I'll use Magic
Flower Guidepost

236
00:12:53,722 --> 00:12:56,558
to figure out what the layout
of this place is like.

237
00:12:58,643 --> 00:13:02,689
Wow. You really know
your stuff, don't ya?

238
00:13:02,772 --> 00:13:04,274
Let me see.

239
00:13:04,357 --> 00:13:06,943
It looks like there
are several big spaces,

240
00:13:07,027 --> 00:13:09,612
and I sense elven mana
in each of them.

241
00:13:09,696 --> 00:13:11,906
We're in one of the many
connecting chambers

242
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,742
that run throughout the palace.

243
00:13:13,825 --> 00:13:15,410
And apparently,
the rest of our team's

244
00:13:15,493 --> 00:13:18,455
been scattered
across multiple areas.

245
00:13:18,538 --> 00:13:19,914
So before we can regroup,

246
00:13:19,998 --> 00:13:22,584
they'll have to
defeat all the elves!

247
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:24,753
[MIMOSA]
And that won't be easy.

248
00:13:24,836 --> 00:13:27,297
We're up against the
Apostles of Sephira.

249
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,507
One of their members
alone has more magic

250
00:13:29,591 --> 00:13:32,802
than a squad captain!

251
00:13:32,886 --> 00:13:34,346
[MIMOSA] The uppermost
chamber seems to have

252
00:13:34,429 --> 00:13:36,723
the strongest magic of all!

253
00:13:36,806 --> 00:13:38,808
[gasps] Bet that's him!

254
00:13:40,393 --> 00:13:43,188
Okay! So once everybody
defeats the elf

255
00:13:43,271 --> 00:13:44,856
who's waitin' inside each room,

256
00:13:44,939 --> 00:13:47,067
we meet up where the boss is!

257
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:50,111
[MIMOSA] Right! And the
central chamber is directly

258
00:13:50,195 --> 00:13:52,405
above our heads. We should go!

259
00:13:52,489 --> 00:13:54,449
[ASTA]
Yeah!

260
00:13:54,532 --> 00:13:57,285
I dunno who we're gonna
have to go up against,

261
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:59,788
but our only option is to win!

262
00:14:02,248 --> 00:14:02,999
[gasps]

263
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:05,168
[birds chirping]

264
00:14:05,251 --> 00:14:11,549
[water rushing]

265
00:14:11,633 --> 00:14:13,426
Don't tell me...

266
00:14:16,179 --> 00:14:17,972
[ASTA]
These paintings...

267
00:14:19,724 --> 00:14:21,267
[RILL]
Hey there!

268
00:14:23,144 --> 00:14:26,690
[RILL]
You and I have met before.

269
00:14:26,773 --> 00:14:27,899
It's Rill!

270
00:14:27,982 --> 00:14:29,943
Oh, come on, we went
over this last time--

271
00:14:30,026 --> 00:14:33,363
my name's Lira! Oh, well!

272
00:14:33,446 --> 00:14:35,615
I'm waiting for the final
magic stone to arrive,

273
00:14:35,699 --> 00:14:38,034
so in the meantime, I say
we practice a little bit,

274
00:14:38,118 --> 00:14:39,119
how's that sound?

275
00:14:39,202 --> 00:14:40,662
Here's an idea.

276
00:14:40,745 --> 00:14:43,081
How 'bout I wake
you up right now?

277
00:14:43,164 --> 00:14:45,583
I'm already as
awake as I can be.

278
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:49,462
So there's no need.
Picture Magic is fun, huh?

279
00:14:49,546 --> 00:14:51,715
It took a little while
to get used to,

280
00:14:51,798 --> 00:14:57,220
but it's way better than
the scribbles I did before.

281
00:14:57,303 --> 00:15:02,183
We elves are about to
design a totally new world.

282
00:15:02,267 --> 00:15:04,728
And as soon as we get rid
of all you ugly humans,

283
00:15:04,811 --> 00:15:07,313
we'll have a nice fresh
canvas to paint on!

284
00:15:07,397 --> 00:15:09,149
Fine then, looks like
we're gonna have to

285
00:15:09,232 --> 00:15:10,942
do this the hard way!

286
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:18,742
I don't get it.
Where did everybody go?

287
00:15:18,825 --> 00:15:21,369
I need some backup!

288
00:15:24,914 --> 00:15:26,332
[gasps]

289
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:29,502
[FANA] Sounds like you're
lonely, so I'll play with you!

290
00:15:29,586 --> 00:15:32,797
But I have a feeling the game
won't go on very long.

291
00:15:32,881 --> 00:15:34,049
You again?

292
00:15:34,132 --> 00:15:36,676
I don't understand this;
why are you here?

293
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,763
Aw, poor thing,
you look so confused!

294
00:15:39,846 --> 00:15:42,432
I may be Fana, but I'm
a much different Fana

295
00:15:42,515 --> 00:15:45,185
than the one you remember.

296
00:15:45,268 --> 00:15:48,605
So you're the opponent
I wound up with?

297
00:15:48,688 --> 00:15:50,482
You may be a filthy royal,

298
00:15:50,565 --> 00:15:54,194
but at least your
mana is interesting.

299
00:15:54,277 --> 00:15:55,862
I'm about to teach
you the importance

300
00:15:55,945 --> 00:15:58,948
of respecting your elders,
you mangy brat.

301
00:15:59,032 --> 00:16:02,035
Despite my adolescent form,
I won't be easy prey.

302
00:16:02,118 --> 00:16:05,497
No human alive can
tame this beast!

303
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:08,416
[FUEGOLEON] I heard that
you had become a captain.

304
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,670
Yet we meet again to
fight on opposing sides.

305
00:16:11,753 --> 00:16:14,130
How regrettable.

306
00:16:14,214 --> 00:16:17,050
You were once a great
man, Lord Kaiser!

307
00:16:17,133 --> 00:16:18,802
I suppose.

308
00:16:18,885 --> 00:16:20,929
There's no reason for
you to hold back,

309
00:16:21,012 --> 00:16:23,973
seeing as you and I don't
actually know one another.

310
00:16:24,057 --> 00:16:26,810
Indeed. I won't hold back.

311
00:16:26,893 --> 00:16:30,021
That would be ignoble.
And what's more,

312
00:16:30,105 --> 00:16:32,273
I know Lord Kaiser
is more than capable

313
00:16:32,357 --> 00:16:35,360
of putting up a decent fight.

314
00:16:35,443 --> 00:16:37,862
He never cared much
for the spotlight,

315
00:16:37,946 --> 00:16:40,532
so I assume he became the
captain of the Purple Orcas

316
00:16:40,615 --> 00:16:43,159
for the sake of his squad.

317
00:16:43,243 --> 00:16:46,287
His poor wife was terribly
worried about him.

318
00:16:46,371 --> 00:16:48,415
He's an excellent Magic Knight,

319
00:16:48,498 --> 00:16:52,794
and there are people
awaiting his return!

320
00:16:52,877 --> 00:16:55,505
So you will surrender him now!

321
00:16:57,257 --> 00:17:01,302
Flame Spirit Magic:
Salamander's Breath!

322
00:17:08,101 --> 00:17:09,352
[gasps]

323
00:17:09,436 --> 00:17:13,023
Ha, ha, ha! That's quite
a powerful spell you have.

324
00:17:13,106 --> 00:17:15,692
Sadly, it will never reach me.

325
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:18,028
[FUEGOLEON] Lord Kaiser's
Vortex Magic allows him

326
00:17:18,111 --> 00:17:21,990
to deflect and disperse
opposing attacks.

327
00:17:22,073 --> 00:17:23,783
That, combined with
the elven magic,

328
00:17:23,867 --> 00:17:26,745
makes him impervious
to Salamander's power.

329
00:17:26,828 --> 00:17:29,164
None of my spells will harm him!

330
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:40,425
[FUEGOLEON] He can use the
vortex for offense, as well!

331
00:17:40,508 --> 00:17:41,426
Even with Mana Skin,

332
00:17:41,509 --> 00:17:43,511
I'm taking a great
deal of damage.

333
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:46,890
And all the while, he's
washing my magic away!

334
00:17:46,973 --> 00:17:48,892
[KAISER chuckles]

335
00:17:56,816 --> 00:17:58,777
[yells]

336
00:17:59,819 --> 00:18:00,820
[VETTO laughs]

337
00:18:00,904 --> 00:18:02,947
[yells]

338
00:18:06,117 --> 00:18:08,620
[VETTO growls]

339
00:18:09,829 --> 00:18:11,706
[yells]

340
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:20,215
Ha, ha! I burned you to a crisp,
and you're still fighting!

341
00:18:20,298 --> 00:18:24,386
[MEREOLEONA] Speed, reflexes,
and strength! A worthy foe!

342
00:18:24,469 --> 00:18:27,555
Impressive for a mere boy!

343
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:29,391
Same goes for you!

344
00:18:29,474 --> 00:18:30,934
I never knew of another human

345
00:18:31,017 --> 00:18:33,061
that could put up
a decent fight!

346
00:18:38,066 --> 00:18:40,318
[MEREOLEONA] It's been a while
since I had this much fun

347
00:18:40,402 --> 00:18:43,446
fighting a snot-nosed
brat one-on-one.

348
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:46,282
Takes me back to my youth.

349
00:18:46,366 --> 00:18:49,369
[FUEGOLEON] He detects magic
and blocks it automatically,

350
00:18:49,452 --> 00:18:51,913
so my attacks will
never touch him.

351
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:56,459
[FUEGOLEON]
This unfair advantage.

352
00:18:56,543 --> 00:18:59,337
It reminds me of my sister.

353
00:18:59,421 --> 00:19:03,591
She's had that wild,
audacious spirit all her life.

354
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:07,303
I idolized her for her strength.

355
00:19:07,387 --> 00:19:10,015
That is, until I
became frustrated with

356
00:19:10,098 --> 00:19:12,225
her devil-may-care attitude.

357
00:19:15,478 --> 00:19:20,191
[MEREOLEONA] There you are!
I'll get you this time!

358
00:19:20,275 --> 00:19:22,068
Come back inside!

359
00:19:22,152 --> 00:19:26,114
It's time for our training
with Sister Theresa! Hey!

360
00:19:26,197 --> 00:19:29,409
[SISTER THERESA]
Just let her go, Fuego.

361
00:19:29,492 --> 00:19:31,453
Mereo doesn't need
to train with us,

362
00:19:31,536 --> 00:19:33,455
she'll become
stronger on her own.

363
00:19:33,538 --> 00:19:36,041
That's how special she is.

364
00:19:38,209 --> 00:19:39,753
[FUEGOLEON]
Looking back now,

365
00:19:39,836 --> 00:19:42,964
I'm sure I must have been
quite jealous of her.

366
00:19:44,924 --> 00:19:47,469
[FUEGOLEON]
What? I don't believe this!

367
00:19:47,552 --> 00:19:49,304
You really have no
interest in working

368
00:19:49,387 --> 00:19:51,389
with the Crimson Lion Kings?

369
00:19:51,473 --> 00:19:52,640
That's right.

370
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:54,142
But why is that?

371
00:19:54,225 --> 00:19:55,727
With amazing abilities
like yours,

372
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:58,355
you'd be unstoppable
as a Magic Knight!

373
00:19:58,438 --> 00:20:01,232
You could even become
the Wizard King someday!

374
00:20:01,316 --> 00:20:02,859
[MEREOLEONA] After I get
my grimoire tomorrow,

375
00:20:02,942 --> 00:20:06,279
I'm setting off to explore
the strong magic regions.

376
00:20:06,363 --> 00:20:08,365
Who'd wanna waste their
time on guard duty

377
00:20:08,448 --> 00:20:11,868
and catching petty
criminals? It's foolish.

378
00:20:13,703 --> 00:20:15,914
[FUEGOLEON]
"Foolish"?

379
00:20:15,997 --> 00:20:17,582
[FUEGOLEON]
Sister.

380
00:20:20,543 --> 00:20:22,379
[FUEGOLEON]
I want to spar.

381
00:20:22,462 --> 00:20:25,298
One round, both of us
giving it our all.

382
00:20:25,382 --> 00:20:27,008
Right here and now!

383
00:20:28,176 --> 00:20:29,344
Oh, really?

384
00:20:29,427 --> 00:20:31,763
At least make it fun
for me this time.

385
00:20:31,846 --> 00:20:33,348
You're so dull.

386
00:20:36,226 --> 00:20:38,603
[NARRATOR] This momentous
fight between the Vermillion

387
00:20:38,687 --> 00:20:41,648
family's eldest son
and eldest daughter

388
00:20:41,731 --> 00:20:44,025
would later come
to be regarded as

389
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:47,195
"The Tuesday of
Blood and Flames."

390
00:20:47,278 --> 00:20:50,907
[MEREOLEONA] That overly serious
fool was on fire back then!

391
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:56,162
[laughing] You're probably
the most powerful human

392
00:20:56,246 --> 00:20:58,289
in this whole kingdom!

393
00:20:59,499 --> 00:21:01,167
I'm sure if I can defeat you,

394
00:21:01,251 --> 00:21:04,462
the rest of the humans
will be no trouble at all.

395
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:08,717
[KAISER]
Begone!

396
00:21:10,093 --> 00:21:12,971
You're mine, human!

397
00:21:20,603 --> 00:21:22,272
[BOTH]
Not me.

398
00:21:22,355 --> 00:21:23,732
[KAISER, VETTO gasp]

399
00:21:25,316 --> 00:21:29,029
[FUEGOLEON] She's unorthodox,
cavalier, and even somewhat mad,

400
00:21:29,112 --> 00:21:31,489
but everywhere she goes,
people clear a path,

401
00:21:31,573 --> 00:21:33,742
fearing her bold power.

402
00:21:34,784 --> 00:21:37,579
[MEREOLEONA] He's overbearing,
unbending, and most of all,

403
00:21:37,662 --> 00:21:40,582
boring, but his refined,
exceptional strength

404
00:21:40,665 --> 00:21:42,417
has earned him the
respect and loyalty

405
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,210
of all who follow him.

406
00:21:44,294 --> 00:21:45,837
[FUEGOLEON]
My sister...

407
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,255
[MEREOLEONA]
My brother...

408
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:50,425
[BOTH] ...is worthy of being
called the strongest!

409
00:21:50,508 --> 00:21:51,718
[FUEGOLEON]
Reignition.

410
00:21:51,801 --> 00:21:53,803
[MEREOLEONA]
Times Two!

411
00:21:53,887 --> 00:21:57,098
[KAISER] He erased his magic
using Salamander as a decoy.

412
00:21:57,182 --> 00:21:59,309
That's how he was able
to permeate the vortex

413
00:21:59,392 --> 00:22:01,811
and get close enough to hit me!

414
00:22:01,895 --> 00:22:04,606
[VETTO] By using will power
to endure my attacks,

415
00:22:04,689 --> 00:22:07,567
she conserved enough magic
for her next strike!

416
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:10,445
[FUEGOLEON] As my sister's
younger brother...

417
00:22:10,528 --> 00:22:13,239
[MEREOLEONA]
As that idiot's older sister...

418
00:22:13,323 --> 00:22:15,742
[FUEGOLEON]
I must prevail!

419
00:22:15,825 --> 00:22:18,953
[MEREOLEONA]
I have to be strong!

420
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:25,877
[FUEGOLEON, MEREOLEONA yell]

421
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:58,428
[FANA]
Hey, Fana here! Huh?

422
00:23:58,511 --> 00:24:00,347
Fana from the Diamond Kingdom?

423
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:03,433
Oh, yeah, she's Fana, too,
but we're not the same Fana.

424
00:24:03,516 --> 00:24:06,644
<i>Black Clover</i> , Page 114:
"The Final Invaders."

425
00:24:06,728 --> 00:24:07,729
She's her own Fana.

426
00:24:07,812 --> 00:24:10,899
and I'm my own Fana.
Simple as that!
