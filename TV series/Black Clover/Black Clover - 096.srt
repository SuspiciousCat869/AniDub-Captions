until a lone mage

took up the fight.

Sun's hideout.

to defeat Rhya for good...

So we should be able
to talk things over.

13

Both sides are mad because
we lost someone we loved.

where all of us get along

and laugh together.

16

And when I'm Wizard King,
we'll have one.

something so outrageous.

[RHYA]
I think he's actually serious!

21
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:33,083
In fact, it reminds me of what
someone else said once before.

22
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:34,834
If only the rest
of the human race

way these guys do.

24
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:39,047
Then maybe...

No. It's too late to stop now.

00:01:45,428 --> 00:01:47,472
[NARRATOR] At the same time,
the true intentions

27
00:01:47,555 --> 00:01:50,141

Patry, were finally

28
00:01:50,225 --> 00:01:52,018
beginning to come
to the surface.

29
00:01:52,102 --> 00:01:54,312
Patry had once been
betrayed by humans,

30
00:01:54,396 --> 00:01:56,231
forced to witness the
violent mass-murder

of his fellow elves.

32
00:01:57,732 --> 00:02:01,069
And so, since assuming
the identity of Licht,

33
00:02:01,152 --> 00:02:04,114
he had been working to resurrect
his fallen companions.

34
00:02:04,197 --> 00:02:06,199
For going back on their word,

35
00:02:06,282 --> 00:02:10,161
for killing the people
I loved, they must pay!

all be annihilated!

[PATRY]
Indeed.

The great rebirth will
start with the humans.

[YAMI grunts]

162
00:11:38,188 --> 00:11:40,648
[YAMI] Owen's Recovery
spell is different, too.

163
00:11:40,732 --> 00:11:43,068
Way stronger and
twisted somehow.

164
00:11:43,151 --> 00:11:46,404
Like he wants to break your
body instead of healing it.

165
00:11:50,033 --> 00:11:51,076
[YAMI]
Get it together, Yami.

166
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:53,370
Just grab 'em both and end this!

167
00:11:53,453 --> 00:11:55,538
I don't recognize
that corpse there.

168
00:11:55,622 --> 00:11:58,083
Is it someone who
was important to you?

169
00:12:01,711 --> 00:12:03,296
Not that it matters.

170
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,632
He was a human, so he
was a repulsive sinner

171
00:12:05,715 --> 00:12:07,676
who deserved to die anyway.

172
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:09,177
Take that back.

If he's so precious
to you, feel free to pay

your respects while I

piece by piece!

You're not Marx and Owen,

177
00:12:21,272 --> 00:12:23,358
and I'm not gonna let
you spew that garbage

Go on, charge right in.

That's even easier.

[YAMI]
Now, Why don't you stay put?

191
00:13:00,979 --> 00:13:03,148
I have to protect this country.

A promise I made to a man
both of you respected.

[YAMI]
Man, what a mess.

Those two aren't
even combat mages.

My comrades.

Letting down your guard

as soon as you awakened.

00:13:33,845 --> 00:13:37,474
It'll serve our mission better
if you sleep within my spell.

At least, for now.

Long time, no see, huh?

00:13:46,733 --> 00:13:49,652
I've never known you
to cut people slack.

I don't know you at all.

207
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:54,491

[CITIZEN 96B]
Powerful spells, everywhere!

211
00:14:11,174 --> 00:14:14,761
The kingdom's being
attacked again already?

Get the hell outta here! Now!

If you don't escape,
I'll waste ya myself!

[YAMI] Let the buildings
crumble all over town.

As long as its people live,
a nation never dies.

But with so many of these
jokers runnin' around,

218
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:41,538
the people might not
hold out, either.

219
00:14:41,621 --> 00:14:43,540
The smell of those
roses is coverin' up

220
00:14:43,623 --> 00:14:48,294
her magic power. This
really isn't like her.

You know what? Heh.

222
00:14:50,714 --> 00:14:53,717
I always was good
at hide-and-seek!

223
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,344
Dark Cloaked, Lightless Slash!

Your intuition is sharp!

225
00:15:00,223 --> 00:15:03,476
That's not it.
It's 'cause of your ki.

226
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,478
It came through loud and clear!

00:15:05,562 --> 00:15:07,022
[CHARLOTTE]
My "ki"?

228
00:15:08,231 --> 00:15:10,150
[YAMI]
Gotta love ki!

229
00:15:13,028 --> 00:15:15,321
[YAMI] She's got Charlotte's
ki and all her moves,

230
00:15:15,405 --> 00:15:17,490
but the fighting
style's different.

231
00:15:17,574 --> 00:15:19,617
Her signature midrange
attacks are there,

232
00:15:19,701 --> 00:15:22,203
but now she's got a slew
of close-range spells,

233
00:15:22,287 --> 00:15:25,290
and that smell is scramblin'
her magic power.

234
00:15:25,373 --> 00:15:28,001
Not to mention her
air-tight defense.

235

With that workin' against me,

it won't be easy
to knock her out.

Her roses.

238

she was cursed as a little girl.

have no reason to be.

But you can lean on someone else

lots of other strong
people to lean on?

[YAMI]
I'm a bit fuzzy on the details,

259
00:16:54,796 --> 00:16:57,590
but I think the curse got
lifted back then, too.

260
00:16:57,674 --> 00:16:59,843
If that's the case,
then you'd think the roses

261
00:16:59,926 --> 00:17:01,886
would have changed color.

262
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,975
[YAMI]
Well. She is an elf inside.

263
00:17:07,058 --> 00:17:08,685
Maybe the mark of
the curse went away

264
00:17:08,768 --> 00:17:10,979
now that she's
not human anymore.

265
00:17:11,062 --> 00:17:14,983
This must be Charlotte Roselei's
original Briar Magic!

266
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:18,445
The Charlotte I used
to know was a determined

267
00:17:18,528 --> 00:17:20,321
woman who used her
curse to her advantage

268
00:17:20,405 --> 00:17:22,240
and made herself stronger!

269
00:17:24,367 --> 00:17:26,202
And now you let someone
take over your body

00:17:26,286 --> 00:17:27,787

their own purposes?

You didn't mean to
hurt us, right, Char?

that or abandon her!

00:18:59,462 --> 00:19:02,048
[SOL] Char's hyper-concentrated

from casting my spells properly!

No! Not after all

Then let go--

319
00:19:42,922 --> 00:19:44,883
Not until I'm finished!

320
00:19:44,966 --> 00:19:46,092
You have to survive, dum-dum,

321
00:19:46,176 --> 00:19:48,803
not just for her sake,
but for his, too!

322
00:19:51,681 --> 00:19:52,891
Mark my words.

323
00:19:52,974 --> 00:19:54,642
Nobody gets near
Char on my watch,

324
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:57,145
especially not some lowlife man!

325
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:01,274
Please save Char.

326
00:20:01,358 --> 00:20:04,319
The Blue Rose Knights
need their captain.

327
00:20:04,402 --> 00:20:06,237
I'm counting on you!

328
00:20:06,321 --> 00:20:09,991
Then stand down. I got this.

329
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:12,619
[CHARLOTTE] You missed
your chance to run away.

330
00:20:13,787 --> 00:20:15,580
I'm not plannin' to.

331
00:20:15,663 --> 00:20:18,625
Dark Magic: Black Hole.

332
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,293
Your subordinate's cryin'!

[gasps]

334
00:20:21,628 --> 00:20:23,630
You're just gonna let
them do what they want?

335
00:20:23,713 --> 00:20:27,550
That's what a weakling
would do, and you're not weak!

336
00:20:27,634 --> 00:20:29,302
I know you're not!

337
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:37,018
[CHARLOTTE] You're quite
strong. I respect you.

338
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:40,063
This magic power
is unbelievable.

339
00:20:40,146 --> 00:20:43,858
Black Hole won't nearly be
enough to absorb it all.

340
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:45,235
One good blast from that

341
00:20:45,318 --> 00:20:47,696
and half the town'll
be blown to smithereens.

342
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:50,156
takin' countless lives with it.

343
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:55,495
Hah. You have my respect.
You've had it all along.

344
00:20:55,578 --> 00:20:59,207
That's why... Whatever it takes,

345
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:01,042
I'll save you.

You guys, what's wrong?

00:21:33,241 --> 00:21:36,578
It's just so beautiful.

354
00:21:38,038 --> 00:21:40,707
[NOELLE] It's just like
with Vetto and the others.

355
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,834
It feels so evil.

356

Why's that kind of magic
power coming from you?
