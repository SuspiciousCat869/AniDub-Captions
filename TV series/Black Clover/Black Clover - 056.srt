1
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:15,625
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:18,375
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:24,458
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:26,875
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:35,625
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:39,750
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:13,458
[NARRATOR]
Fanzell Kruger:

8
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:15,541
the former head of
Mage Knight education

9
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:18,333
for the Diamond Kingdom,
and, by an odd coincidence,

10
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:19,958
the man who taught
Asta the sword.

11
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:23,833
[FANZELL, ASTA grunting]

12
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:25,291
No! You're too slow.

13
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:26,833
Don't pause between hits.

14
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:29,166
What we're after is
rapid-fire attack.

15
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,125
Right! [yells]

16
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:34,125
[NARRATOR]
Some time after the two met,

17
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:36,833
the Black Bulls were sent out
on a dungeon-clearing mission.

18
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:39,333
They battled a Diamond
Kingdom mage named Mars,

19
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:41,166
and Asta was gravely injured.

20
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,625
Noelle had gone out to
gather restorative herbs

21
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:45,583
for her wounded squadmate.

22
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,500
[NOELLE]
Come on, where is it?

23
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:50,958
That's the one!

24
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:53,375
[FANZELL]
Excuse me.

25
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:54,916
You there, with the silver hair.

26
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,958
Yes, hello! Do you
have a second?

27
00:02:58,041 --> 00:03:00,416
I'm sorry to bother you,
but it won't take long.

28
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,958
[yelps]

29
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:04,208
[FANZELL] I just wanted a closer
look at something of yours.

30
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:06,625
Like I said, it'll
only take a second.

31
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:08,916
Why, you...

32
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,333
--What?
--[NOELLE] You pervert!

33
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:12,916
[yelps]

34
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,375
[FANZELL]
Wait! No. It's not like that!

35
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:15,625
Please, I swear!

36
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:17,500
[NOELLE] Oh, yeah?
Then what is it like, huh?

37
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:19,500
How's a man supposed
to get a decent nap

38
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:21,416
with all this
screamin' goin' on?

39
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,416
Is that Noelle?

40
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,041
[growls]

41
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:27,000
[screams]

42
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:28,666
[NOELLE]
Don't let him touch me!

43
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,375
[YAMI]
Hm?

44
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:32,625
[FANZELL panting]
You've got it all wrong.

45
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:34,125
I'm not some kinda creep.

46
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:35,791
I just want a real quick look.

47
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:37,333
Please, I'm even
willing to pay you.

48
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:38,875
Just a peek, that's all.

49
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:40,625
Ah--

50
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:42,333
Oh...

51
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:49,541
Feel my wrath!

52
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:52,333
"Pan" is only one letter
away from "pain"!

53
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:54,208
Poor thing. It must have
been so frightening,

54
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:57,166
being set upon by
a vile man like that.

55
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,791
What were you tryin'
to do to her?

56
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:01,166
She came running in,
scared outta her mind.

57
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:04,208
You're lucky we busted you up
instead of killing you.

58
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:06,000
Please. It's not how it looks.

59
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:07,208
I was robbed, that's why--

60
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:09,166
Nobody wants to hear it, freak.

61
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,583
We should let him loose.

62
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,666
Then we can capture him again!

63
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:16,041
You don't deserve to live
in the same world as Marie.

64
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,208
Now die.

65
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:18,708
Yes, Knights Headquarters,
this is Finral,

66
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,458
reporting for the Black Bulls.

67
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:22,333
We have a pervert
in custody here

68
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:23,958
and will be bringing
him in at once.

69
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:25,166
No, please don't.

70
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,583
I can explain. This is
a misunderstanding!

71
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:30,083
Miss Understanding works
at the tavern I think.

72
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:32,375
I think we're having some
communication issues.

73
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:33,375
[ASTA]
Zell?

74
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:36,208
Hold on. Asta?

75
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:38,875
[ASTA] Whoa, you're not lookin'
so good. Are you okay?

76
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:40,041
Sort of.

77
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:41,708
But enough about me,
it seems you made it

78
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:45,000
into a Magic Knight
squad. Congratulations.

79
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,833
[YAMI]
Hm?

80
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:49,041
[GAUCHE] So it was all
a misunderstanding?

81
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:51,166
[VANESSA] You were robbed
and they took your clothes?

82
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,583
[MAGNA]
You coulda told us that earlier!

83
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:56,333
I tried, but you weren't
exactly in a listening mood.

84
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:58,416
Yeah, details,
details. Who cares?

85
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,750
Here you go.

86
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:02,208
It's like I always say,
"better bread than dead!"

87
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:03,625
Oh, sure, thanks.

88
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:05,916
[mumbling] We don't get
new friends very often.

89
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,125
I hope you'll tell me
more about yourself.

90
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:09,375
What's wrong?

91
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:12,333
Zell. I gotta say,
you look pretty familiar.

92
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:14,375
Have we met somewhere before?

93
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:15,458
Uh, no.

94
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:17,208
I think I would
remember meeting you.

95
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:20,125
How'd you end up at our
hideout anyway, old man?

96
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:21,791
[FANZELL]
Oh! I forgot!

97
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:24,166
Excuse me, but you're
Noelle, aren't you?

98
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,708
I'm really sorry for
frightening you like that.

99
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:29,958
I wanted to ask you about
your wand, that's all.

100
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:31,750
That's what you wanted to see?

101
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:34,791
Yes. I think I know its maker.

102
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:38,000
A woman named Domina I've
been seeking for a while now.

103
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:39,375
Domina?

104
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:40,333
I remember that name.

105
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,500
She's your fiancée, isn't she?

106
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:45,500
All right. But I don't
think she made this.

107
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:47,500
The person who gave it
to me was named Code.

108
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:50,000
Doesn't sound like this
"Domina" you're looking for.

109
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,875
It is, though. It's her!

110
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:55,791
You see, her full name
is actually Dominante Code.

111
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:57,083
Where did you get it?

112
00:05:57,166 --> 00:06:00,125
From a stall in the castle
town's black market.

113
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:03,083
The castle town. Thank you.

114
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,416
[ASTA] Domina's alive!
That's awesome news, Zell.

115
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,208
Well, go get her!
What are you waiting for?

116
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:13,500
You're right. I should go.

117
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,291
Right now. Thank you.

118
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,916
I can take you there.

119
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,583
Noelle. Listen.

120
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:21,916
Because of you,
I'm going to be reunited

121
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,833
with the woman I love,
finally. Thank you.

122
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:28,666
I didn't do anything, though.

123
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,291
Captain, sir, am I
free to leave now?

124
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,166
Yeah. Sure, why not.

125
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,083
But don't go blabbin' about
how we falsely imprisoned you.

126
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:38,708
You're the one talking
about false imprisonment.

127
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:41,583
[YAMI] Shut it, Portal Boy.
Speakin' of which.

128
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:43,833
Use your Spatial Magic
to send 'em on their way.

129
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:47,958
Then we'll be square.
I need a dump and a nap.

130
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,583
[sighs]

131
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,000
[FANZELL]
I appreciate it.

132
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:52,250
I should get going,
or it's gonna be

133
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,916
too hard to say goodbye.

134
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,208
See ya, Asta.

135
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,875
I'm glad our paths
crossed again,

136
00:06:57,958 --> 00:06:59,500
even if it wasn't for long.

137
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,916
Now, go out and
become the Wizard King.

138
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,083
Sure thing!

139
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:05,208
And you go and live
happily ever after!

140
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:13,250
Everyone, get down!

141
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:14,833
[CHARMY]
Ha!

142
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:17,083
Ooh, cool! Someone's
attacking us!

143
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:19,458
It's probably the people
who are after me.

144
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:23,666
So, sounds like it's
time to get outta here.

145
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,041
The hell is this?

146
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:27,916
Whoever woke me up just
earned themselves a killin'.

147
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,375
There's been no movement so far.

148
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:37,916
Strange Master Fanzell
didn't leave at once.

149
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,958
That's what I would've
expected him to do.

150
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:42,041
[GALLEO]
For now, let's watch and wait.

151
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:44,208
Squads one through four,
maintain your formation

152
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:46,000
and begin a steady advance.

153
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:49,750
Squads five and six, continue
to stand ready at the rear.

154
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:53,333
That building--it looks like
some sort of dormitory.

155
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:56,083
Yes. I ought to be
on my way now.

156
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:59,333
Commander Galleo, a portal,
if you wouldn't mind.

157
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:00,916
You want a little
insurance in case

158
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,125
our sneak attack fails?

159
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:06,458
I honestly don't know what
you're so worried about.

You remember who allowed
you to live, right?

You beat up your teacher

You're the Black Bulls

00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:31,958
[GALLEO] Did Mariella know that
when she ordered us to attack?

255
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:34,083
Hold on, you're telling us
you sent your own men

256
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,416
to storm the
Black Bulls' hideout

257
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,333
hoping they'd get crushed?

258
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:39,416
Meanwhile, I came here
to the black market

259
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,333
and informed Domina
that Master Fanzell

260
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:43,000
would be arriving soon.

261
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:45,333
I wanted to ensure
she was prepared.

262
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:46,666
However, I didn't expect you

263
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,041
to get here so quickly.

264
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:50,541
This is a map.

265
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:53,458
I've researched escape routes
and plotted them on it.

266
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:56,041
I don't understand why you
would do this, though.

267
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:57,541
Nor I.

268
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:00,166
[MARIELLA] To strike a blow
against the Diamond Kingdom.

269
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,000
A number of their assassins
are now out of commission.

270
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,708
Master Fanzell and Domina
will be able to escape.

271
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:07,000
So, in other words,

272
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:08,708
I set a plan in motion
that would badly

273
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:10,875
damage the organization.

274
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:12,291
This is revenge.

275
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,750
Mine, against those
who have controlled me.

276
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,250
[ASTA]
Why now?

277
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:18,791
Much like my teacher, I'm tired.

278
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:21,250
I can't do what they
ask of me anymore.

279
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,208
That said,

280
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:26,500
I don't believe
I have the strength

281
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,875
to stay on the run
for my whole life.

282
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:31,583
It wasn't easy,
but I made a decision.

283
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:33,791
Exact my revenge and
then turn myself in

284
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:36,125
to the Clover Kingdom's
Magic Knights.

285
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:38,416
You were gonna turn yourself in?

286
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,708
[MARIELLA] I was nearby,
waiting for the circumstances

287
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:42,541
to properly align.

288
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,500
I watched as Master
Fanzell approached

289
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:47,500
the Black Bulls' hideout
and saw him dragged inside.

290
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,291
I thought, if I sent
those troops against you,

291
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,375
you would annihilate
them for me.

292
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:53,041
Thank you for consulting us.

293
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,375
She makes it sound so easy.

294
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,958
And now, will you please
take me into custody?

295
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:00,208
Then we all get what we want.

296
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:01,833
[FANZELL]
Think about this, Mariella.

297
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:03,708
Do you know what you're asking?

298
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:06,250
You could be subjected
to extreme punishment.

299
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:09,041
The Clover Kingdom won't
forget your past crimes.

300
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,833
And the organization
can still reach you

301
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:13,416
even if you're in
somebody else's custody.

302
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,291
I'm willing to accept that.

303
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:18,416
Yes. As long as
my life is spared.

304
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,583
[gasps]

305
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:22,416
I've been thinking
about what you said.

306
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,791
We have to find our own hope,
our own reason for living.

307
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:26,541
Right?

308
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:28,250
Yeah, what about it?

309
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,041
[MARIELLA] It was
obnoxious and overbearing.

310
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:31,416
Ah--

311
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:35,291
That said, it was also moving,
and sort of dashing.

312
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,291
Oh, you think so?

313
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:40,208
Whatever punishment
I might receive

314
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:42,625
is the price I have to pay
to atone for my crimes

315
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:44,500
and begin a new life.

316
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:48,750
So, no matter how severe it is,
I'll bear it without complaint.

317
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:49,958
I see.

318
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:51,708
[GALLEO]
I've had enough of this!

319
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,000
[gasps] Galleo, sir!

320
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:56,625
You're the assassin
corps commander,

321
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:59,083
and you've abandoned your
troops? That's horrible!

322
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:01,208
And what do you
call what you did?

323
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:04,833
If you want so desperately to
be executed, I can oblige you.

324
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:06,375
Everybody, run.

325
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:09,333
He may sound like a petty fool
who's just full of hot air,

326
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:11,541
but his magic's quite tricky.

327
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:12,750
That's right!

328
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:15,375
Spatial Creation Magic:
Unopening Red Room!

329
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:19,500
Asta!

330
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:25,000
Now, Spatial Creation
Magic: Go, Riftmen.

331
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:31,041
[ASTA]
What are these creepy red guys?

332
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:33,166
And why's the room all red?

333
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,666
[MARIELLA] Galleo's initial
spell created this place,

334
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,208
and those figures
are magic soldiers

335
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:38,916
that can only exist here.

336
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,791
They're not going
to be easy to beat.

337
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,666
But wait. Hold on.

338
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:46,916
You jumped in front of the spell
without knowing what it did?

339
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
If that had been offensive
magic he was using,

340
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:51,583
you could have died!
Are you stupid?

341
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:52,833
Well, maybe.

342
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:54,166
So what if I am?

343
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,000
I'd rather be stupid
than just stand back

344
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:57,583
and watch somebody die!

345
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:58,541
[gasps]

346
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,083
And besides.

347
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:02,125
Something's changed since the
last time we saw each other:

348
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:04,500
I'm Asta of the Black Bulls now!

349
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:06,208
But, I'm still your enemy?

350
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:08,916
I don't care. This is who I am.

351
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,041
If someone needs help, I'll
help 'em as much as I want!

352
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,250
You got it?

353
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:17,500
But, hey, if you wanna
give me some backup

354
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,625
while I'm at it, I won't mind.

355
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:20,750
[ASTA yells]

356
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:22,708
I may not be as
altruistic as he is,

357
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:25,416
but I can't stand by and
watch a student suffer.

358
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,875
So come on, let's work together
and get through this!

359
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:32,208
Get through this? How can we?

360
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:35,166
Easy! This is nothing!

361
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,916
[ASTA, FANZELL yell]

362
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
No! Impossible!

363
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,250
[YAMI]
Yeah, Knights Headquarters?

364
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,541
This is Yami of the Black Bulls.

365
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:46,833
We've got a bunch
of troublemakers

366
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:48,875
rounded up out here.

367
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:50,750
Come and get 'em, wouldja?

368
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:56,000
[GAUCHE] That's a lot of
mages to have hunting you.

369
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,958
Who is this Fanzell person
and what did he do

370
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:00,166
to get so many people
sicced on him?

371
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,916
Wait, hold on.
Don't you mean Zell?

372
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,125
Uh-- No, according to
Grey his full name

373
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:06,250
is actually Fanzell.

374
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:07,833
[GREY growls]

375
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:12,708
Ah! That's right.
He's Fanzell Kruger.

376
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:14,791
He was the commander
of the Diamond Kingdom's

377
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:16,208
invading army.

378
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:19,708
I met the guy on the battlefield
a really long time ago.

379
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,083
Seriously?

380
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,875
I heard he moved from
commanding the army

381
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,833
to training their soldiers,
but I guess he musta deserted,

382
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:27,250
which would explain
why everybody

383
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:29,833
and their mom was
tryin' to get to him.

384
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:32,916
I realize it isn't my
place to ask this, sir.

385
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,291
And, correct me if I'm wrong,
but did we just help

386
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:36,625
a high-ranking member of our

387
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:39,083
greatest enemy's
military escape?

388
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:41,541
[YAMI]
Sounds about right.

389
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:42,916
Hey, Gauche.

390
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,916
Yes, Captain?

391
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,416
Never speak of this again.

392
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,791
My lips are sealed.

393
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,916
Please give me a
week of Marie-leave.

394
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,625
You're only supposed to see
her once a month, aren't you?

395
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:54,375
I'll watch her
so surreptitiously

396
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:57,666
for all 168 hours
that nobody will know.

397
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:01,000
Man, you've got
some serious issues.

398
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:03,583
[NARRATOR] And so, the case
of the creepy naked man

399
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,958
and the mysterious attack
on the Black Bulls' hideout

400
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:08,125
was put to rest at last.

401
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,291
Are you sure it's okay
for us to leave like this?

402
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:18,250
I'm worried that it'll
only cause all of you

403
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:21,125
more trouble in the long run
if we just up and vanish.

404
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:22,916
Captain Yami didn't
have any problems

405
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,416
with you guys going,
so I'm sure it's fine.

406
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,125
Don't you think so?

407
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:29,000
Yes. Sure.

408
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:30,541
[FINRAL]
Not fine.

409
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,958
And it'll probably turn into
something extremely not fine.

410
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:35,125
Are you sure you're
okay with this, though?

411
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:37,625
Mariella isn't exactly
the nicest person.

412
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:40,375
All the terrible things
I did were under duress.

413
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,250
Galleo and his assassin
corps were going

414
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,250
to kidnap me and
hold me hostage.

415
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,875
She's the one who put
a stop to that, remember?

416
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,958
Besides, if you think
about it, Mariella here

417
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:51,833
is the reason my Zell
and I were reunited.

418
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:56,791
Honestly, there's such a thing
as being too nice, ya know?

419
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:59,666
You're one to talk--
you and your pushover squad.

420
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,000
Honestly, I manipulated
all of you so easily,

421
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:03,541
it was ridiculous.

422
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:06,125
I never asked for your help,
and I don't need it.

423
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,416
I can get by just fine
without anybody else.

424
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,625
The only person you need
in your life is you.

425
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:14,125
You've been telling yourself
that for a while, huh?

426
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:15,958
Taking on the burden
alone is actually

427
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:17,583
surprisingly easy, isn't it?

428
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:18,958
You just keep
saying to yourself,

429
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:21,166
as long as you can get
through it, you'll be fine.

430
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,583
There's no need to consider
the people around you,

431
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:27,125
so there's not really much
thinking involved at all.

432
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:30,166
I hate to tell you, but
that's off the table now.

433
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,750
Because once you have
people in your life

434
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:34,333
who care about you, your
problems and your decisions

435
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:35,958
aren't only your own anymore.

436
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,791
[gasps]

437
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:40,291
[NOELLE]
That's right.

438
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:42,333
Now you've gotta
think about them, too.

439
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:44,458
So you'd better get used to it.

440
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:47,583
I guess I'm not
the only one here

441
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:49,250
with personality issues.

442
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:53,375
Well, it's not like I care
what you think, anyway.

443
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:57,125
All right, we should get going,
or it's gonna be too hard-- 

444
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:59,000
Hey, there's nothin'
to cry about.

445
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:01,541
Remember, you and me are guys
who like to get things done.

446
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:03,750
And like you said, there's
no time for sittin' around.

447
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:05,666
So get to work, old man!

448
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:09,666
Go out there and make
Domina as happy as you can!

449
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,083
You're right.

450
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,083
I was given more time when
I thought I had none left,

451
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:14,458
and I won't waste it.

452
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:16,750
Together, Mariella, Domina and I

453
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:19,083
are going to live life
to the fullest.

454
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:20,541
That's the spirit!

455
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,625
I'll write once things
settle down a bit.

456
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:27,000
Great! Take care of yourself.

457
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:31,625
Uh, and, well, I hate
to ask this but, uh...

458
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,875
Remember how you all
thought I was a creep,

459
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:35,541
but then I told you
I was actually robbed

460
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:38,416
and my clothes were taken?

461
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,083
[chuckles]

462
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:41,458
You're kidding, right?

463
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,916
Do you think I could
borrow some money?

464
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,416
[meows]

465
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:49,166
We should've just let the
Diamond Kingdom have you!

466
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,708
[NARRATOR] And that's the
story of how Fanzell, Domina,

467
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:54,458
and Mariella met
the Black Bulls.

468
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:58,041
[NARRATOR] Back in the
present, Noelle and Finral

469
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:00,291
have called on Fanzell
hoping he might be able

470
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:02,916
to help them find a way
to heal Asta's arms.

471
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
[NOELLE]
Domina, Mariella! How have you--

472
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:06,458
Enough with the naked thing!

473
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:08,458
You're a grown man,
keep your clothes on!

474
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:10,083
[FANZELL]
Ow! Hey! Stop!

475
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:11,541
It's not my fault!

476
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,416
[MARIELLA] This house is
already run-down enough.

477
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,750
Don't contribute
to its sorry state.

478
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:20,500
Oh, wow. Poor Asta,
that's terrible.

479
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:22,041
He's had quite an eventful life

480
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:24,250
for someone who's
still so young.

481
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:27,375
His bad luck is inversely
proportional to his height.

482
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:29,083
Do you have any ideas?

483
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:31,208
We have to find
a way to heal him.

484
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,875
Anything will be helpful.

485
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:36,250
So, Ancient Hex Magic, huh?

486
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:37,708
Well, there is one place.

487
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:38,708
[NOELLE, FINRAL gasp]

488
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:41,333
My homeland, the
Forest of Witches.

489
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,250
You think they'd help?

490
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,791
[DOMINANTE] The Queen of
the Witches' magic would.

491
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:56,000
[inhales]

492
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:57,375
Hey!

493
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:59,500
The smartest witch ever
to grace the Land of Witches

494
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:01,250
has come back to say hello.

495
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:04,125
I have business here,
so open up!

496
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:48,875
[FINRAL] We might have found
a way to heal Asta's arms!

497
00:23:48,958 --> 00:23:52,000
All right, time to infiltrate
the Forest of Witches.

498
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:54,583
Ooh! Look at all these
beautiful witch-girls!

499
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:55,833
Hello, ladies!

500
00:23:55,916 --> 00:23:58,375
<i>Black Clover</i> ,
Page 57: "Infiltration."

501
00:23:58,458 --> 00:24:00,791
Maybe I can infiltrate
a heart or two!
