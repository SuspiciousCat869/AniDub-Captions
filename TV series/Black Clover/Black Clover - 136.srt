The Clover Kingdom.

00:00:24,222 --> 00:00:26,599
In this place where
magic is everything,

3
00:00:26,683 --> 00:00:29,561
there lives one boy
who was born without it.

4
00:00:29,644 --> 00:00:31,938
His name is Asta.

5
00:00:33,273 --> 00:00:34,607
[NARRATOR]
His strength and determination

6
00:00:34,691 --> 00:00:36,901
helped him become
a Magic Knight.

7
00:00:36,985 --> 00:00:39,571
And despite the many
challenges he faces,

8
00:00:39,654 --> 00:00:43,742
he aims for the top
and refuses to give up!

9
00:00:43,825 --> 00:00:45,368
Rich or poor,

10
00:00:45,452 --> 00:00:47,495
royalty or commoner,

11
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:50,415
Asta believes anyone can shine.

12
00:00:50,498 --> 00:00:53,460
His mission is to prove
that to the whole world,

13
00:00:53,543 --> 00:00:56,338
and to become the
next Wizard King!

14
00:01:00,091 --> 00:01:02,719
[NARRATOR] In order to defeat
Megicula, the devil lurking

15
00:01:02,802 --> 00:01:06,514
in the Spade Kingdom, the Magic
Knights have been training hard.

16
00:01:08,558 --> 00:01:10,226
[NARRATOR]
In the briny depths of the sea,

17
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:13,146
another dangerous
threat has emerged.

Kiato! Kahono!

00:01:20,236 --> 00:01:21,738
You two make a run for it.

21
00:01:21,821 --> 00:01:22,781
[KAHONO]
We can't!

22
00:01:22,864 --> 00:01:23,990
[GIO]
You must.

23
00:01:24,074 --> 00:01:26,159
Seek the aid of
the Magic Knights.

24
00:01:26,242 --> 00:01:28,244

28
00:01:35,627 --> 00:01:36,628
[KAHONO]
Okay.

29
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:21,649
[NARRATOR] The beach town
of Raquey is hot year-round

30
00:03:21,733 --> 00:03:24,277
due to the strong mana
that surrounds it.

31
00:03:24,361 --> 00:03:26,529
This makes it a popular resort.

32
00:03:26,613 --> 00:03:28,740
But it is also an
excellent training ground

33
00:03:28,823 --> 00:03:32,327
for magic users.
Water mages most of all.

34
00:03:36,289 --> 00:03:38,875
[NOELLE] If I can just
maintain this force.

[NOELLE pants]

36
00:03:54,516 --> 00:03:56,893
[NOELLE]
I can create two twisters now,

37
00:03:56,976 --> 00:03:59,813
but I need to keep them
both supplied with mana.

Is that crying? A song?

41
00:04:17,247 --> 00:04:22,585
I'm not sure why, but it
feels sort of nostalgic.

42
00:04:24,796 --> 00:04:28,008
[NOELLE gasps] Wait, why did
I just see my mother?

[ASTA]
Black Bulls, fight!

44
00:04:30,635 --> 00:04:31,720
Ya feel that burn?

[MAGNA]
Oh, yeah!

00:04:32,721 --> 00:04:33,805

Wait, push through it!

00:04:38,476 --> 00:04:40,895
Are you out of steam already?

50
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:42,981
[FINRAL] Well, it's not
like I run very often.

51
00:04:43,064 --> 00:04:45,150
I mean, c'mon. What gives?

52
00:04:45,233 --> 00:04:47,318
Why can't we just
train with magic?

53
00:04:47,402 --> 00:04:49,612
Because, when we were
fighting against the elves,

54
00:04:49,696 --> 00:04:52,449
Yami and Asta proved that this
kinda training matters, too.

55
00:04:52,532 --> 00:04:53,658
The stronger your body gets,

56
00:04:53,742 --> 00:04:55,577
the stronger your
magic's gonna be.

57
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:58,329
Right. Come on!
Let's get to it, Finral!

58
00:04:58,413 --> 00:05:00,040
Bulk up till you're
as big as Captain Yami,

59
00:05:00,123 --> 00:05:01,374
and you'll be unstoppable!

[FINRAL] Aren't you setting
the bar kinda high?

61
00:05:03,793 --> 00:05:05,670
We should all get super
buff and then all of you

62
00:05:05,754 --> 00:05:07,756
should try to fight me
at the same time!

63
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:09,257
Round two, guys!

Damn it. I missed one.

What the hell did you trap
us for, ya sneaky bastard?

69
00:05:23,104 --> 00:05:24,731
Last time I checked,
the best way

70
00:05:24,814 --> 00:05:27,484
to train up your magic
was to use it.

71
00:05:27,567 --> 00:05:30,153
So, that's just
what I've been doing.

72
00:05:30,236 --> 00:05:33,031
I'd say sorry, but I
didn't join this squad

73
00:05:33,114 --> 00:05:34,115
to make friends with you idiots.

74
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:35,700
What was that?

75
00:05:36,701 --> 00:05:37,744
[MAGNA]
Damn it, Luck!

76
00:05:37,827 --> 00:05:38,703
Are you trying to bury us?

00:05:38,787 --> 00:05:40,830
You bet I am! Here!

Good grief.

[NOELLE] How can just four
people make this much noise?

00:05:51,049 --> 00:05:52,884
[GREY]
Th-- This is terrible.

83
00:05:52,967 --> 00:05:54,844
I can't hide my face
while I'm doing this pose,

84
00:05:54,928 --> 00:05:56,471
it's so embarrassing!

85
00:05:56,554 --> 00:05:58,431
[VANESSA] I've been eating a
whole lot of Charmy's cooking

86
00:05:58,515 --> 00:06:00,058
lately and its starting to show.

87
00:06:00,141 --> 00:06:01,142
Gotta lose weight.
Gotta lose weight.

88
00:06:01,226 --> 00:06:03,228
Gotta lose weight.
Gotta lose weight!

89
00:06:07,065 --> 00:06:08,775
The simplest way to
bulk up is to stress

90
00:06:08,858 --> 00:06:10,694
your muscles in a
controlled manner.

91
00:06:10,777 --> 00:06:12,278
When weight training,
you should probably break up

92
00:06:12,362 --> 00:06:14,072
your workout into three "sets."

93
00:06:14,155 --> 00:06:16,074
You should also track
your protein intake--

94
00:06:16,157 --> 00:06:18,159
This info on the connection
between the deltoids

95
00:06:18,243 --> 00:06:20,537
and trapezius proves that
by gaining more anatomical

96
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,832
knowledge, I can make my new
Marie doll far more accurate!

97
00:06:23,915 --> 00:06:25,250
Question for you, Gordon.

98
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:27,085
I thought you said you
had trouble spending time

99
00:06:27,168 --> 00:06:29,170
in the sun without
getting burnt.

100
00:06:29,254 --> 00:06:30,880
Were you able to get over that?

101
00:06:30,964 --> 00:06:33,800
Yes, I can stay out as
long as I'd like to now.

102
00:06:33,883 --> 00:06:36,261
It's all thanks to
this special sunblock.

103
00:06:36,344 --> 00:06:38,430
Would you care to try
it out for yourself?

who we're looking for,
I'll chalk it up to providence.

[GIFSO]
A strong one.

[KAHONO] They've been around
since time immemorial.

They're said to be
servants of the Sea God.

148

[NOELLE]
So this creature is sacred?

00:08:58,403 --> 00:09:01,406
If you serve the same god,
then why would it attack you?

150
00:09:01,489 --> 00:09:03,825
Something's begun to
disturb the flow of mana

151

in this part of the sea.

As a result, much
of the local fauna

it hard to make out details.

South of this Temple, in a place
called the Void of No Return,

00:09:28,725 --> 00:09:30,602
I'm sure that the
disturbance I've felt

161
00:09:30,685 --> 00:09:33,730
in the mana here was caused
by this Guardian's fury.

162
00:09:33,813 --> 00:09:36,107
The temple mages might
have calmed the Guardian

163
00:09:36,191 --> 00:09:38,068
by performing their
song and dance,

164
00:09:38,151 --> 00:09:40,695
but they never got
a chance to try.

165
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:44,699
Our best warriors were
wounded trying to defend us.

166
00:09:44,783 --> 00:09:46,034
[NOELLE]
Kahono.

167
00:09:46,117 --> 00:09:47,410
[GIFSO] We've brought
you here to request

168
00:09:47,494 --> 00:09:50,121
that you grant Kiato and
Kahono your protection.

169
00:09:50,205 --> 00:09:52,749
Please use your considerable
strength to escort them

170
00:09:52,832 --> 00:09:55,085
to the Void of No Return safely.

171
00:09:55,168 --> 00:09:57,462
Sounds like a whole
lotta not my problem.

172
00:09:57,545 --> 00:09:59,839
We're all really busy
training right now.

173
00:09:59,923 --> 00:10:02,092
You spent all day drinking
in a beach chair!

174
00:10:02,175 --> 00:10:03,551
Please, sir!

175
00:10:03,635 --> 00:10:06,596
I ask because I know how
powerful the Black Bulls are!

176
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,140
You proved this in the
battle royale we fought,

177
00:10:09,224 --> 00:10:11,685
and through your ability
to reach the Underwater Temple

178
00:10:11,768 --> 00:10:14,145
safely despite
being land-dwellers

179
00:10:14,229 --> 00:10:17,857
Though that was through
the sea goddess's protection.

180
00:10:20,985 --> 00:10:23,863
[YAMI] This may sound harsh,
but have ya got any proof that

181
00:10:23,947 --> 00:10:28,243
your song and dance can actually
calm this Guardian down?

182
00:10:28,326 --> 00:10:29,536
Not exactly.

183
00:10:29,619 --> 00:10:31,579
Protecting the kingdom
isn't a hobby for us,

184
00:10:31,663 --> 00:10:33,248
it's a job.

185
00:10:33,331 --> 00:10:35,792
We need to put our efforts
where we know they'll count.

186
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:37,794
I'm not about to loan
you my squad members

187
00:10:37,877 --> 00:10:40,088
when your resolve is this weak.

188
00:10:41,715 --> 00:10:43,008
[NOELLE]
So basically,

189
00:10:43,091 --> 00:10:45,260
we just need to convince
you that this could work.

190
00:10:45,343 --> 00:10:46,136
Huh?

191
00:10:46,219 --> 00:10:47,512
What do you mean?

192
00:10:47,595 --> 00:10:49,139
[NOELLE] This mana
disturbance is affecting

193
00:10:49,222 --> 00:10:50,724
a massive part of the sea.

194
00:10:50,807 --> 00:10:53,727
It's possible that there's
a devil behind this, too.

195
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:56,187
As magic knights,
we are sworn to protect.

196
00:10:56,271 --> 00:10:58,189
I'll get your mages
to the Guardian safely,

197
00:10:58,273 --> 00:10:59,899
there's no doubt in my mind.

198
00:10:59,983 --> 00:11:00,900
[KAHONO]
Noelle.

199
00:11:00,984 --> 00:11:05,196
[KIATO]
The Sea Goddess provides!

200
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,781
[KIATO]
I'm sure now.

201
00:11:06,865 --> 00:11:09,534
We'll quell the Guardian's
rage, you have my word!

202
00:11:09,617 --> 00:11:11,786
We've sung and danced
for the almighty sea god!

203
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,663
We're prepared for this task!

204
00:11:13,747 --> 00:11:14,914
One way or another,

205
00:11:14,998 --> 00:11:17,876
we will make the Guardian
hear our prayers!

206
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:20,962
That's the kinda resolve
I can get behind.

207
00:11:21,046 --> 00:11:23,840
Now. Convince me it'll work.

208
00:11:23,923 --> 00:11:27,177
I have a plan, and I
think you'll like it.

209
00:11:36,811 --> 00:11:40,023
[KAHONO]
It's over there. See it?

210
00:11:40,106 --> 00:11:41,983
The Void of No Return.

211
00:11:42,067 --> 00:11:43,651
Its name is based on
the legend that

212
00:11:43,735 --> 00:11:47,280
those who wander into its
depths are never seen again.

213
00:11:49,324 --> 00:11:51,159
We were told stories as kids,

214
00:11:51,242 --> 00:11:53,119
but I never thought
they were real.

215
00:11:53,203 --> 00:11:56,498
Even now, it's a bit of a
struggle to believe my eyes.

216
00:11:56,581 --> 00:11:58,792
[FINRAL]
How deep do you think this goes?

217
00:12:03,588 --> 00:12:06,091
[YAMI]
So, what's your plan?

218
00:12:06,174 --> 00:12:08,093
I'll make a smaller and
more powerful version

219
00:12:08,176 --> 00:12:09,844
of the Sea Dragon's Cradle.

220
00:12:09,928 --> 00:12:11,388
There's a trade-off.

221
00:12:11,471 --> 00:12:14,265
It'll be durable, but it won't
carry more than four people.

222
00:12:14,349 --> 00:12:16,935
[YAMI] Well, with you, Kahono
and Kiato, we've already got

223
00:12:17,018 --> 00:12:19,813
our first three passengers,
but we could still fit one mo--

224
00:12:19,896 --> 00:12:24,401
Me! Me! Me! Me! Please?
Oh, man, I wanna go so bad!

225
00:12:24,484 --> 00:12:26,403
Why sing to the Guardian
when we could kill it?

226
00:12:26,486 --> 00:12:29,280
I wonder how strong it is.
I can't wait to find out!

227
00:12:29,364 --> 00:12:31,449
Just send me and
I'll get it done quickly.

228
00:12:31,533 --> 00:12:33,535
Marie awaits me.
Her deltoids need carving.

229
00:12:33,618 --> 00:12:35,912
Please tell me there's
something I'm missing here!

230
00:12:35,995 --> 00:12:38,581
Maybe this Guardian wants
to rejoin the cycle of life!

231
00:12:38,665 --> 00:12:40,959
Talk about well-aged
meat, am I right?

232
00:12:41,042 --> 00:12:43,003
Yeah, I'm not
sending any of you.

233
00:12:43,086 --> 00:12:44,337
[LUCK, CHARMY]
What?

234
00:12:44,421 --> 00:12:45,380
[GAUCHE grunts]

235
00:12:45,463 --> 00:12:46,631

And you're not goin', either.

236

[ASTA groans]
Are you serious, sir? Why?

237
00:12:50,385 --> 00:12:52,012
Is it because I can't swim?

238
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:54,389
Forgot about that.
You really can't go.

239
00:12:54,472 --> 00:12:57,142
[groans] This isn't fair!

240
00:12:57,225 --> 00:12:59,519
[NOELLE]
He's such an idiot.

241
00:12:59,602 --> 00:13:01,229
Finral.

242
00:13:01,312 --> 00:13:02,313
You go.

243
00:13:02,397 --> 00:13:03,398
Huh?

244
00:13:03,481 --> 00:13:05,400
Get 'em out if things go bad.

245
00:13:05,483 --> 00:13:10,488
Even if you have to die
to do it. Understood?

246
00:13:10,572 --> 00:13:12,073
Yes, sir!

247
00:13:12,157 --> 00:13:13,783

00:13:16,953 --> 00:13:18,663
so make sure you see it through.

Sir!

252
00:13:24,169 --> 00:13:25,879
[NOELLE]
Such violent mana.

253
00:13:25,962 --> 00:13:28,965
If I let my guard down for
even a second, we're finished.

00:13:52,113 --> 00:13:54,240
It's strange, but my guess
is that the local fish

266
00:13:54,324 --> 00:13:56,910
were turned into monsters
by the powerful mana that's

267
00:13:56,993 --> 00:13:59,037
concentrated around
the Guardian.

268

I'm supposed to

hearing yourself?

I can't leave while
you're down here.

gonna pull that off?

Look, the captain said
to bring everyone back.

He said to do it
even if it kills me.

And I might be a screw-up,

that I'd abandon a girl

Here it comes!

hasn't turned bad.

It's just protective

As for the creatures we fought.
