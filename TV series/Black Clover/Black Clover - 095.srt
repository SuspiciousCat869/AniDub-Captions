1
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,557
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,560
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:32,105 --> 00:00:34,357
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:34,441 --> 00:00:37,152
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:43,491 --> 00:00:45,535
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:45,618 --> 00:00:49,664
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:51,583 --> 00:00:53,376
[NARRATOR]
Wizard King Julius Novachrono

8
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,587
had successfully shielded
the people of Clover

9
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,005
from an assault by Licht,

10
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:59,382
leader of the Eye
of the Midnight Sun.

11
00:00:59,466 --> 00:01:01,968
But his courageous act
came at a heavy cost.

12
00:01:02,052 --> 00:01:06,389
[YAMI] What happened here?
Tell me, Vangeance!

13
00:01:06,473 --> 00:01:09,017
Salutations. Yami, is it?

14
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,311
You may call me Licht.

15
00:01:11,394 --> 00:01:13,938
[NARRATOR] Yami attempted
to launch a counterattack.

16
00:01:14,022 --> 00:01:16,107
[YAMI]
Dark Magic...

17
00:01:16,191 --> 00:01:18,026
Now, Dark Cloaked...

18
00:01:18,109 --> 00:01:20,653
Dimension Slash!

19
00:01:20,737 --> 00:01:25,950
[NARRATOR] But Licht escaped.
And as for Julius...

20
00:01:26,034 --> 00:01:29,245
I'm leaving the rest to you now.

21
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,082
Yes, sir.

22
00:01:34,793 --> 00:01:37,837
[LICHT] This is where we must
bid each other farewell.

23
00:01:37,921 --> 00:01:39,130
[ALL gasp]

24
00:01:39,214 --> 00:01:42,467
[LICHT] The great rebirth
will start with you.

25
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:44,511
[NARRATOR] Only now is
Licht finally beginning

26
00:01:44,594 --> 00:01:47,931
to reveal his true
intentions for this world.

27
00:03:27,072 --> 00:03:28,615
[ELVES cheering]

[ELF VILLAGER 95A]
Wow, I can't believe it!

29
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:32,202
[ELF VILLAGER 95B]
Licht and his Sword Magic

30
00:03:32,285 --> 00:03:35,455
have been chosen by the
four-leaf clover grimoire!

31
00:03:35,538 --> 00:03:37,207
[PATRY]
What's so exciting, Mom?

32
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:40,710
Well, my dear, only a select few
can get a grimoire like that.

33
00:03:40,794 --> 00:03:43,546
And it comes with an extra
helping of good luck!

34
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,090
[PATRY]
Oh.

35
00:03:47,717 --> 00:03:51,471
[PATRY] Licht and his
four-leaf grimoire. Wow!

36
00:03:51,554 --> 00:03:53,306
He's so cool!

37
00:03:58,853 --> 00:04:00,021
[PATRY]
There you are!

38
00:04:00,105 --> 00:04:01,272
[LICHT, RHYA]
Hm?

39
00:04:03,817 --> 00:04:05,235
This kid again?

40
00:04:05,318 --> 00:04:07,696
Look, stop comin' over here
and buggin' us every day;

41
00:04:07,779 --> 00:04:10,699
it's such a pain! Get lost.

42
00:04:10,782 --> 00:04:13,660
I'm not here because I wanted
to hang out with <i>you</i> .

43
00:04:13,743 --> 00:04:15,036
What'd you say, shorty?

44
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,913
Oh, I don't mind
if he stays, Rhya.

45
00:04:16,996 --> 00:04:19,374
This isn't a bother
to me at all.

46
00:04:19,457 --> 00:04:22,711
Thank you for stopping by.
I'm glad you're here.

47
00:04:22,794 --> 00:04:24,295
Whatever.

48
00:04:26,131 --> 00:04:28,258
[PATRY] What do you
think about all this?

49
00:04:28,341 --> 00:04:29,342
[LICHT]
Hm?

50
00:04:29,426 --> 00:04:31,094
You know, there's
been a lot of talk

51
00:04:31,177 --> 00:04:35,056
about humans planning
to attack us.

52
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,142
I'm sure it's a rumor.

53
00:04:37,225 --> 00:04:39,978
It's still a possibility
though, isn't it?

54
00:04:40,061 --> 00:04:41,271
I mean, think.

55
00:04:41,354 --> 00:04:43,481
The human race is so
wicked and mean-spirited,

56
00:04:43,565 --> 00:04:45,233
they slaughter animals
for the sport of it,

57
00:04:45,316 --> 00:04:48,486
without ever giving it
a second thought.

58
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,280
They don't have much
power on their own,

59
00:04:50,363 --> 00:04:53,825
but a big group can be dangerous
when they get carried away.

60
00:04:53,908 --> 00:04:55,785
Even though we elves
helped them recover

61
00:04:55,869 --> 00:04:59,247
from natural disasters
a long time ago.

62
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,249
They're probably afraid.

63
00:05:01,332 --> 00:05:02,542
[PATRY]
What?

64
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,252
[LICHT]
Both sides are afraid.

65
00:05:04,336 --> 00:05:07,756
We have things in common,
but we fear what we don't know.

66
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:11,092
Regardless of that, this land
blesses everyone equally

67
00:05:11,176 --> 00:05:12,677
with magical grimoires.

68
00:05:12,761 --> 00:05:16,222
So, why wouldn't we
understand each other?

69
00:05:16,306 --> 00:05:17,891
[sighs]

70

--[RHYA] Hm?
--[rumbling]

71
00:05:19,225 --> 00:05:20,769
What's that thing?

72
00:05:22,062 --> 00:05:25,398
[LICHT] A tornado of natural
mana running wild.

73
00:05:25,482 --> 00:05:27,150
It's awfully big, isn't it?

74
00:05:27,233 --> 00:05:30,153
Yeah, but it should
die down on its own.

75
00:05:30,236 --> 00:05:32,238
[yawns] Man, talk about a pain.

76
00:05:32,322 --> 00:05:33,281
[TETIA screams]

77
00:05:33,365 --> 00:05:34,741
What's that?

78
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:45,251
What's he doing?

79
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:49,172
Looks like there's someone
inside the tornado!

80
00:05:49,255 --> 00:05:50,757
Yeah, it does.

81
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,384

00:05:53,593 --> 00:05:55,637

[FIRST WIZARD KING]
Light Magic: Lamp of Avior!

84
00:06:09,275 --> 00:06:10,568
He's okay!

85
00:06:10,652 --> 00:06:14,030
Licht is amazing,
stopping that big thing!

86
00:06:14,114 --> 00:06:15,281
But wait...

87
00:06:15,365 --> 00:06:16,866
That light mage was using spells

88
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:19,411
that were just as
powerful as his are.

89
00:06:19,494 --> 00:06:21,579
I wonder who that guy is.

90
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,457
You're not hurt, are you?

91
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:26,459
No. I'm fine!

92
00:06:26,543 --> 00:06:28,753
Thank you for saving me!

93
00:06:30,714 --> 00:06:33,216
[FIRST WIZARD KING] Tetia, don't
leave the castle like that!

94
00:06:33,299 --> 00:06:34,718
I'm sorry.

95
00:06:34,801 --> 00:06:36,636
Besides, a Wind Magic
user like you

96
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,221
isn't supposed to be
getting herself caught

97
00:06:38,304 --> 00:06:41,099
in a mana tornado.
What were you thinking?

98
00:06:42,559 --> 00:06:44,477
[FIRST WIZARD KING]
Thank you for helping my sister.

99
00:06:44,561 --> 00:06:45,645
It's no--

100
00:06:48,064 --> 00:06:49,524
[FIRST WIZARD KING]
Hm?

101
00:06:57,198 --> 00:06:57,991
[BOTH gasp]

102
00:06:58,074 --> 00:06:59,784
Hey, look at his grimoire.

103
00:06:59,868 --> 00:07:04,247
It's a four-leaf, just
like yours! But he's human.

104
00:07:12,464 --> 00:07:14,049
[VETTO] Licht's been
spending quite a lot of time

105
00:07:14,132 --> 00:07:15,717
with those two lately.

106
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,635
[RHYA]
You can say that again.

107
00:07:17,719 --> 00:07:21,222
Seems like he's happy
to have some human friends.

108
00:07:21,306 --> 00:07:24,100
But hey, they really
are good people.

109
00:07:24,184 --> 00:07:25,769
Apparently, they
have the same idea

110
00:07:25,852 --> 00:07:27,687
about society that he does.

111
00:07:27,771 --> 00:07:28,813
[VETTO]
Idea?

112
00:07:28,897 --> 00:07:30,482
They all believe that
humans and elves

113
00:07:30,565 --> 00:07:32,817
can figure out how to
live together peacefully.

114
00:07:32,901 --> 00:07:34,486
Ah, is that so?

115
00:07:34,569 --> 00:07:37,489
[PATRY] It's odd to see an elf
making friends with humans,

116
00:07:37,572 --> 00:07:39,366
but if he's doing
it, then I guess

117
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:42,619
it must not be such a bad thing.

118
00:07:42,702 --> 00:07:44,829
Besides, that Light
mage was good enough

119
00:07:44,913 --> 00:07:47,665
to be chosen by the four-leaf
clover grimoire, too,

120
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:49,918
so they're not that different.

121
00:07:57,509 --> 00:07:59,761
Let's foster understanding.

122
00:07:59,844 --> 00:08:03,223
Your elvish mana really
is a remarkable thing!

123
00:08:03,306 --> 00:08:07,060
If we combine that with our
own magic-item technology,

124
00:08:07,143 --> 00:08:10,438
this land will be safer
and more prosperous!

125
00:08:10,522 --> 00:08:13,358
Let's all work together,
hand in hand!

126
00:08:13,441 --> 00:08:18,446
[ELVES cheer]

127
00:08:24,035 --> 00:08:26,079

Is it true? You're with child?

128
00:08:26,162 --> 00:08:29,791
[FANA gasps] With you for
parents, it'll be a lovely baby!

129
00:08:29,874 --> 00:08:32,794
Hey, congrats, Tetia!
And you, too, I guess.

130
00:08:32,877 --> 00:08:36,381
[laughs] Well, thank you
for including me, Rhya.

131
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:40,051
[RHYA] What are you
pouting about, tiny?

132
00:08:40,135 --> 00:08:41,553
It's nothing.

133
00:08:41,636 --> 00:08:44,222
You're still little.
You'll understand one day.

134
00:08:44,305 --> 00:08:45,598
Would you shut up?

135
00:08:45,682 --> 00:08:48,476
Stop talking down to me
like I'm some stupid baby!

136
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,979
[RHYA]
Excuse me then, big man!

137
00:08:51,062 --> 00:08:53,690
Oh, hey, there you are.

[gasps]

140
00:08:57,777 --> 00:08:59,362
Hello, Rhya.

141
00:08:59,446 --> 00:09:01,781
Let me guess, waking up
is a pain, too, now?

142
00:09:01,865 --> 00:09:03,158
You're the worst.

143
00:09:03,241 --> 00:09:06,536
Aw, get off my case.
Oh, and Patry.

144
00:09:06,619 --> 00:09:08,329
I can see you're still
clinging onto Licht

145
00:09:08,413 --> 00:09:10,081
like nobody's business.

146
00:09:10,165 --> 00:09:13,251
He's gonna belong to a human
after tomorrow's big ceremony,

147
00:09:13,335 --> 00:09:15,545
so you'd better start
letting go of him.

148
00:09:15,628 --> 00:09:17,213
Leave me alone, Rhya.

149
00:09:17,297 --> 00:09:19,341
That's my choice
to make, not yours.

150
00:09:19,424 --> 00:09:21,009
Hey, watch your tone!

151
00:09:21,092 --> 00:09:21,885
[TETIA]
It's all right.

152
00:09:21,968 --> 00:09:23,011
Even after we get married,

153
00:09:23,094 --> 00:09:25,555
Licht will still
belong to everybody.

154
00:09:25,638 --> 00:09:28,308
Man, you human princesses
are so generous.

155
00:09:28,391 --> 00:09:31,478
I'd be careful of what I promise
if I were you, though, Tetia.

156
00:09:31,561 --> 00:09:32,937
Before long, there
won't be any room

157
00:09:33,021 --> 00:09:35,565
in his busy schedule
to spend time with you.

158
00:09:35,648 --> 00:09:38,109
You don't have to be
so blunt about things.

159
00:09:38,193 --> 00:09:39,861
Patry knows what to expect.

160
00:09:39,944 --> 00:09:41,237
So what's it like?

161
00:09:41,321 --> 00:09:44,199
Knowing that you'll be a father
in a few months' time?

162
00:09:44,282 --> 00:09:47,160
I can sense that the mana has
blessed our lives, as well.

163
00:09:47,243 --> 00:09:49,954
When our child arrives,
we know that your kind

164
00:09:50,038 --> 00:09:52,248
will welcome it and
we're very grateful.

165
00:09:52,332 --> 00:09:54,084
[TETIA giggles]

166
00:09:54,167 --> 00:09:56,878
This little one here
is the key to our future.

167
00:09:56,961 --> 00:09:59,923
The bridge to unite
elves and humankind!

Good luck!

170
00:10:18,066 --> 00:10:19,567
[ELF VILLAGER 95BB]
We wish you the best!

171
00:10:19,651 --> 00:10:22,237
[ELF VILLAGER 95CC]
Congratulations!

172
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,531
Thank you all very much.

173
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:31,621
Take care of her, okay, Licht?

174
00:10:31,705 --> 00:10:35,333
[LICHT] Yes. I swear I'll keep
her safe, no matter what.

175
00:10:36,418 --> 00:10:39,170
My friends. Thank you
for joining us.

176
00:10:41,506 --> 00:10:43,049
Come to think of it,
aren't you receiving

177
00:10:43,133 --> 00:10:44,676
your grimoire tomorrow?

178
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:46,177
[PATRY]
Oh, wow, you remembered!

179
00:10:46,261 --> 00:10:49,055
Well, how could I forget
something so important?

180
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:50,348
[laughs]

181
00:10:50,432 --> 00:10:51,933
[LICHT] I look forward
to seeing what kind

182
00:10:52,017 --> 00:10:54,436
of grimoire chooses
you as its owner.

183
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:55,437
Me, too!

184
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,523
How sweet! I wanna be a bride.

185
00:10:58,606 --> 00:10:59,983
I'm sure you'll
meet your soulmate

186
00:11:00,066 --> 00:11:01,651
one day, too, Fana.

187
00:11:01,735 --> 00:11:03,278
Yeah, and hopefully soon.

188
00:11:03,361 --> 00:11:05,613
May the rest of your
days be happy ones.

189
00:11:05,697 --> 00:11:07,115
[TETIA]
Thank you!

190
00:11:07,198 --> 00:11:09,659
[RHYA] And you better tell me
if this guy's unfaithful.

191
00:11:09,743 --> 00:11:10,910
I'll smack him around for ya.

192
00:11:10,994 --> 00:11:12,328
[ELVES, TETIA laugh]

193
00:11:12,412 --> 00:11:14,205
[LICHT]
Rhya, don't say that.

194
00:11:14,289 --> 00:11:16,082
[RHYA]
Aw, it's all in fun.

195
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:19,252
[PATRY] He looks like
he's really happy.

196
00:11:19,336 --> 00:11:24,132
But, to tell the truth, he
kind of always looked happy.

197
00:11:24,215 --> 00:11:26,885
I hate to admit it,
but it seems like the ones

198
00:11:26,968 --> 00:11:29,679
who've made him even happier
are her and that other human.

199
00:11:29,763 --> 00:11:31,973
Let's foster understanding.

200
00:11:33,641 --> 00:11:35,143
[PATRY]
I wonder.

201
00:11:35,226 --> 00:11:37,020
Can we really come to
understand each other

202
00:11:37,103 --> 00:11:39,064
like he said we could?

203
00:11:39,147 --> 00:11:41,316
Licht believes it's possible.

204
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:42,859
Maybe they're right.

205
00:11:42,942 --> 00:11:47,572
Elves and human beings,
living side by side.

What's going on?

208
00:11:52,035 --> 00:11:54,371
It's the humans!
They're attacking us!

209
00:11:54,454 --> 00:11:56,581
[ELVES screaming]

210
00:11:56,664 --> 00:11:59,959
Everyone, this way! Let's hurry!

211
00:12:00,043 --> 00:12:02,921
My spells won't work.

212
00:12:03,004 --> 00:12:05,757
Our magic... It's
been sealed away!

213
00:12:07,258 --> 00:12:08,968
[VETTO]
Get down!

214
00:12:09,052 --> 00:12:10,303

You have to get away from here.

00:12:19,813 --> 00:12:22,649
[VETTO]
Hateful humans.

219
00:12:25,318 --> 00:12:28,738
[PATRY] This is Light magic.
Does that mean...?

220
00:12:30,865 --> 00:12:35,328
No. This is a mistake.
It's not true!

221
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:40,250
[ELF CHILD 95A]
Mommy!

222

[ELF VILLAGER 95G]
You can't die!

229
00:12:52,554 --> 00:12:54,806
[PATRY]
No. I refuse to believe it!

230
00:12:54,889 --> 00:12:58,560
It's not real. It's not real.
None of this is real!

231
00:12:58,643 --> 00:13:00,186
No, no, no.

232
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:02,897
No way, no way, no way,
no way, no way!

233
00:13:02,981 --> 00:13:06,985
I won't accept it! I'll never...

234
00:13:12,407 --> 00:13:15,618
...forgive you for...

235
00:13:41,061 --> 00:13:44,064
Is that you, Licht?

[LICHT whimpering]

237
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,819
[PATRY]
Answer me.

238
00:13:57,577 --> 00:13:59,204
Licht...

239
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,253
[LICHT gasps]

240
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,674
[LICHT]
What is this place?

241
00:14:10,757 --> 00:14:17,389
What happened to me?
I thought I was dead.

242
00:14:17,472 --> 00:14:21,643
These hands... They're not mine.

243
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:26,940
[gasps] I look like Licht!

244
00:14:27,023 --> 00:14:30,735
[PATRY] What is this?
Have I become him somehow?

245
00:14:30,819 --> 00:14:35,657
Did my spirit implant
itself in his body?

246
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,409
That's not it.

247
00:14:37,492 --> 00:14:39,452
Judging by how this mana feels,

248
00:14:39,536 --> 00:14:41,746
the body I'm in is human!

249
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:44,666
A human that looks like Licht.

250
00:14:44,749 --> 00:14:48,294
I see, so I really did die.

251
00:14:48,378 --> 00:14:50,213
Whatever Licht unleashed
when our magic

252
00:14:50,296 --> 00:14:52,298
was sealed away,
it must have been

253
00:14:52,382 --> 00:14:54,592
some kind of forbidden spell.

254
00:14:54,676 --> 00:14:57,429
And something extremely
powerful, too!

255
00:14:57,512 --> 00:14:59,931
Like Reincarnation Magic!

256
00:15:02,934 --> 00:15:04,394
This light...

257
00:15:09,482 --> 00:15:12,819
[PATRY] I can sense them.
Every single one!

258
00:15:12,902 --> 00:15:14,863
I can feel Rhya's soul,
and the souls

259
00:15:14,946 --> 00:15:17,699
of all the other elves
in this village!

260
00:15:17,782 --> 00:15:18,992
Licht must have done this

261
00:15:19,075 --> 00:15:22,746
in the final few
seconds of his life!

262
00:15:22,829 --> 00:15:25,457
And all for the
sake of our people.

263
00:15:30,712 --> 00:15:32,339
[PATRY]
But, so far, it seems like

264
00:15:32,422 --> 00:15:36,384
I'm the only one who's
been completely revived.

265
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:38,928
Oh, yeah, his grimoire!

266
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,807
[PATRY] It chose to bond with
Licht, the soul that truly

267
00:15:42,891 --> 00:15:47,729
belongs inside this body,
so I won't be able to use it.

268
00:15:47,812 --> 00:15:49,481
I'm not sure whether
or not this was meant

269
00:15:49,564 --> 00:15:50,982
to happen to me.

270
00:15:51,066 --> 00:15:53,485
But I am the only one
who came back to life.

271
00:15:53,568 --> 00:15:56,488
Not only that, but I came
back looking like Licht!

272
00:15:59,032 --> 00:16:01,201
[PATRY]
I'm the only one...

273
00:16:01,284 --> 00:16:04,079
...who can save the
rest of the elves!

274
00:16:12,712 --> 00:16:14,047
[PATRY]
Which means...

275
00:16:15,298 --> 00:16:17,509
[PATRY]
I have been chosen.

276
00:16:17,592 --> 00:16:21,638
I'll become Licht!
No matter what it takes.

277
00:16:23,723 --> 00:16:28,228
[PATRY] I'll revive all the
elves. As for the humans...

278
00:16:30,313 --> 00:16:32,524
For going back on their word,

279
00:16:32,607 --> 00:16:36,736
for killing the people
I loved, they must pay!

280
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,906
I swear, they will
all be annihilated!

281
00:16:47,205 --> 00:16:50,250
[PATRY]
Forbidden Magic: Evil Eye.

282
00:16:53,586 --> 00:16:57,173
[PATRY] Ah. It would appear
you're finally awake.

283
00:16:57,257 --> 00:16:59,467
This human has a
similar wavelength,

284
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:01,177
so I've imbued your
soul with magic

285
00:17:01,261 --> 00:17:03,596
from the other world to
support your reincarnation

286
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,223
into this body.

287
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:09,310
[PATRY] Gathering enough magic
power to make that possible

288
00:17:09,394 --> 00:17:11,813
wasn't easy, you know.

289
00:17:11,896 --> 00:17:14,190
So please don't cause
me any more trouble.

290
00:17:14,274 --> 00:17:15,900
Okay, Rhya?

291
00:17:15,984 --> 00:17:17,902
Wait, you're Patry.
Why're you...?

292
00:17:17,986 --> 00:17:20,947
[PATRY] But your old friend
Licht can revive everyone.

293
00:17:21,031 --> 00:17:25,410
That's the mission that he--
no, I must fulfil.

294
00:17:25,493 --> 00:17:28,580
You get it, don't you?

295
00:17:28,663 --> 00:17:31,583
Yeah, Licht. I hear ya.

296
00:17:34,002 --> 00:17:35,337
You're here, too?

297
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,421
Rhya.

298
00:17:36,504 --> 00:17:39,841
About time, sleepyhead.
Rise and shine.

299
00:17:39,924 --> 00:17:42,761
[yawns] It was good to sleep in,

300
00:17:42,844 --> 00:17:45,597
but five more minutes
woulda been great.

301
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:49,726
As you can see, I've also
resurrected these two.

302
00:17:53,521 --> 00:17:54,856
[PATRY]
Vetto.

303
00:17:54,939 --> 00:17:57,984
You were a gentle soul who
loved to befriend animals.

304
00:17:58,068 --> 00:18:01,154
Yet, this world has
shown you only cruelty.

305
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:05,867
Live with me, as you once did.

306
00:18:08,286 --> 00:18:10,330
[PATRY] It is not you
who should be despairing,

307
00:18:10,413 --> 00:18:12,916
but those unconscionable humans.

308
00:18:12,999 --> 00:18:15,502
You must remember
your true self.

309
00:18:20,256 --> 00:18:22,300
What a tragedy.

310
00:18:22,384 --> 00:18:24,511
To think we were once friends.

311
00:18:24,594 --> 00:18:27,555
I suppose the world
never changes.

312
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:30,767
If humans are so determined
to harm each other,

313
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:33,353
then we'll just help them along.

314
00:18:33,436 --> 00:18:36,815
However, you're going
to need your body, so...

315
00:18:36,898 --> 00:18:39,609
Let's keep you alive.

316
00:18:39,693 --> 00:18:40,985
[PATRY]
Fana.

317
00:18:41,069 --> 00:18:43,446
Your appearances are so similar,

318
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:45,615
and you share the same name.

319
00:18:45,699 --> 00:18:47,867
This can't be coincidence.

320
00:18:47,951 --> 00:18:49,494
There is no need
for you to suffer

321
00:18:49,577 --> 00:18:53,123
the same sad fate in this age.

322
00:18:53,206 --> 00:18:55,792
Now, awaken!

323
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:04,050
[PATRY] So, these three
are the souls I was able

324
00:19:04,134 --> 00:19:08,763
to restore at this juncture.
It's as if they never died.

325
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:12,225
But I'll need greater power
to bring back the rest.

326
00:19:12,308 --> 00:19:16,146
And that means supplying
even more sacrifices!

327
00:19:18,398 --> 00:19:21,192
[PATRY] To that end, we will
gather the magic stones

328
00:19:21,276 --> 00:19:22,902
that were once kept
within our village

329
00:19:22,986 --> 00:19:25,864
but have since been
scattered far and wide.

330
00:19:25,947 --> 00:19:28,783
And we'll use humans to do it.

331
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:30,410
Smart, don't you think?

332
00:19:30,493 --> 00:19:32,537
--Oh, yeah.
--[FANA] Agreed. Let's begin.

333
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,998
We'll get back at
those hateful scum.

334
00:19:35,081 --> 00:19:38,668
I'll make sure they
suffer endless despair!

335
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:41,338
[PATRY]
Indeed.

336
00:19:41,421 --> 00:19:44,507
The great rebirth will
start with the humans.

337
00:19:48,762 --> 00:19:50,430

[ALL gasp]

339
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:54,517
[RADES] Wait, we're gonna
kick off the rebirth?

340
00:19:54,601 --> 00:19:57,520
You're singin' a different
tune than you used to.

341
00:19:57,604 --> 00:20:00,899
I thought this was the part
where we get a huge power boost!

342
00:20:00,982 --> 00:20:02,692
I see what's goin' on!

343
00:20:02,776 --> 00:20:06,029
You tricked us, didn't you?

344
00:20:06,112 --> 00:20:08,031
Huh? Now what?

345
00:20:08,114 --> 00:20:10,533
[BOTH gasp]

346
00:20:10,617 --> 00:20:12,994
It can't be!

347
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:15,038
From the very moment
I gathered you three

348
00:20:15,121 --> 00:20:17,957
to serve as my allies,
you were marked as sacrifices

349
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:20,043
for this forbidden magic.

350
00:20:20,126 --> 00:20:23,546
And now, it's time that you
receive your true names.

351
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:25,298

[VALTOS, RADES, SALLY scream]

353
00:20:28,301 --> 00:20:30,095
Forbidden magic?

354
00:20:30,178 --> 00:20:31,805
You're kiddin' me!

355
00:20:31,888 --> 00:20:34,516
What makes you think I'm
gonna go by whatever random,

356
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:36,559
off-the-wall name you
throw at me, huh?

357
00:20:36,643 --> 00:20:39,396
I'm Rades Spirito,
and that's that!

358
00:20:39,479 --> 00:20:41,815
No, Master Licht! Please don't!

359
00:20:41,898 --> 00:20:46,361
I just can't believe this.
All this time...

360
00:20:46,444 --> 00:20:50,532
I thought we were your
most cherished friends!

361
00:20:50,615 --> 00:20:53,284
Yes. You truly were.

362
00:20:53,368 --> 00:20:54,619
Then, why?

363
00:20:54,703 --> 00:20:56,121
[PATRY]
I needed you.

364
00:20:56,204 --> 00:20:58,289
After all, you're
the sacrificial lambs

365
00:20:58,373 --> 00:21:00,375
who will bring back
my real friends.

366
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:02,293
You're very dear to me.

Okay.

383
00:23:32,485 --> 00:23:34,320
That starts with a C,
but the way I see it,

384
00:23:34,404 --> 00:23:36,489
"slack" starts with an S,
