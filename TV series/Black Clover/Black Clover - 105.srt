1
00:00:23,763 --> 00:00:25,682
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:25,765 --> 00:00:28,560
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:32,105 --> 00:00:34,441
[NARRATOR] All seemed
lost until a lone mage

4
00:00:34,524 --> 00:00:37,110
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:43,533 --> 00:00:45,535
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:45,618 --> 00:00:49,706
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:53,793
[NARRATOR] The Eye of the
Midnight Sun's hideout

8
00:00:53,877 --> 00:00:55,879
was headed for
the royal capital.

9
00:00:56,963 --> 00:00:59,090
Oh, boy, I think it's
finally time for me

10
00:00:59,174 --> 00:01:01,426
to have some fun for real!

11
00:01:01,509 --> 00:01:04,387
[NARRATOR] Overcome by rage
and a thirst for revenge,

12
00:01:04,471 --> 00:01:07,349
the elf possessing Luck's body
unleashed a ruthless attack

13
00:01:07,432 --> 00:01:10,935
in a crowded town, poised
to kill every human in sight.

14
00:01:11,019 --> 00:01:12,687
[MAGNA]
This ain't right.

15
00:01:12,771 --> 00:01:15,648
I was expectin' to run
into a bad guy here.

16
00:01:15,732 --> 00:01:19,069
Instead we find you. Why?

17
00:01:19,152 --> 00:01:20,570
Heh, heh.

18
00:01:21,571 --> 00:01:23,365
[NARRATOR] The change in
Luck's behavior was a shock

19
00:01:23,448 --> 00:01:25,867
to Vanessa and Magna,
but they engaged him

20
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,494
in battle, nonetheless.

21
00:01:27,577 --> 00:01:33,249
[MAGNA] Flame Magic:
Gargantuan Exploding Fireball!

22
00:01:36,002 --> 00:01:38,338
You're nothin' but an imposter.

23
00:01:38,421 --> 00:01:40,757
And that means you don't
know the first thing

24
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,384
about him or about me!

25
00:01:42,467 --> 00:01:46,513
So come at me all you want,
but you'll never win.

26
00:01:46,596 --> 00:01:50,225
Now give our squadmate
back to us, right now!

27
00:01:51,935 --> 00:01:53,019
[NARRATOR]
But everything they did

28
00:01:53,103 --> 00:01:55,522
only seemed to increase
his resistance.

29
00:01:55,605 --> 00:01:58,775
[LUCK] Now every human
in this kingdom will die.

30
00:01:58,858 --> 00:02:00,610
That's the fate you
deserve, and we elves

31
00:02:00,694 --> 00:02:04,280
will be happy to
make it a reality!

32
00:02:04,364 --> 00:02:08,451
[NARRATOR] Magna was inches
away from death, until...

33
00:02:08,535 --> 00:02:11,788
[ASTA]
You think I'd let you hurt them?

34
00:02:11,871 --> 00:02:13,707
Not a chance!

35
00:02:18,628 --> 00:02:21,089
And who are you?

36
00:02:21,172 --> 00:02:23,883
We're Luck's friends and
fellow Magic Knights!

37
00:03:55,725 --> 00:03:59,104
[LUCK] Found him, and he's
headed straight for me.

38
00:03:59,187 --> 00:04:01,064
He can't escape now.

39
00:04:01,147 --> 00:04:04,192
My rage overpowers everything!

40
00:04:04,275 --> 00:04:05,610
[LUCK giggles]

41
00:04:05,694 --> 00:04:07,445
[LUCK]
There you are!

42
00:04:11,991 --> 00:04:13,993
[LUCK]
He messed up my timing!

43
00:04:14,077 --> 00:04:15,370
Now!

44
00:04:15,453 --> 00:04:17,831
He's wide open!

45
00:04:17,914 --> 00:04:21,126
[ASTA] You're strong,
but our bond is stronger!

46
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:23,211
You lose!

47
00:04:26,089 --> 00:04:28,550
[BOTH]
Nice goin', Asta!

48
00:04:30,719 --> 00:04:32,971
Let's get you outta there!

49
00:04:34,055 --> 00:04:36,266
[ASTA screams]

50
00:04:36,349 --> 00:04:38,184
You humans are doomed.

51
00:04:38,268 --> 00:04:40,645
Just wait and see!

52
00:04:40,729 --> 00:04:41,771
You really don't know when

53
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,815
to throw in the towel,
do ya, punk?

54
00:04:43,898 --> 00:04:46,192
We're not going to
give up on our friend!

55
00:04:46,276 --> 00:04:47,068
We told you!

56
00:04:47,152 --> 00:04:51,948
[ASTA grunting]

57
00:04:52,032 --> 00:04:53,992
[LUCK]
Stop it.

58
00:04:54,993 --> 00:04:58,663
[LUCK]
Get your hands off me!

59
00:05:03,877 --> 00:05:06,504
That's weird. Someone's voice.

60
00:05:06,588 --> 00:05:10,467
I could just barely make
it out, and now it's gone.

61
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,801
[ASTA]
Wake up, Luck!

62
00:05:11,885 --> 00:05:14,721
[MAGNA] If that pisses you
off, then snap out of it

63
00:05:14,804 --> 00:05:16,556
and fight me already,
ya little moron!

64
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,767
[VANESSA]
My red thread of fate has you!

65
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:22,062
Take control of your
body and stop this!

66
00:05:22,145 --> 00:05:25,648
What's going on? Who is that?

67
00:05:25,732 --> 00:05:27,150
[LUCK'S MOTHER]
Luck.

68
00:05:28,818 --> 00:05:30,278
[LUCK]
Mom!

69
00:05:31,571 --> 00:05:34,574
[LUCK'S MOTHER]
Come to my side, my son.

70
00:05:34,657 --> 00:05:37,035
You're not like everyone else.

71
00:05:37,118 --> 00:05:39,579
You have to stay close to me.

72
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,915
[LUCK]
That's right.

73
00:05:41,998 --> 00:05:46,461
The only person who could
ever love me is my mother.

74
00:05:46,544 --> 00:05:50,590
She's my life. Everything
I do is for her.

75
00:05:50,674 --> 00:05:53,510
All I want to do
is make her smile.

76
00:05:58,932 --> 00:06:01,017
I'm gonna use all of my magic!

77
00:06:01,101 --> 00:06:03,061
Then everything'll be destroyed.

78
00:06:03,144 --> 00:06:06,106
You, the rest of these
humans, and even me!

79
00:06:06,189 --> 00:06:08,149
I want all of you
revolting humans

80
00:06:08,233 --> 00:06:10,944
to disappear for good!

81
00:06:11,027 --> 00:06:12,821
[ASTA]
What's goin' on with his ki?

82
00:06:12,904 --> 00:06:14,531
[VANESSA]
Is this really magic?

83
00:06:14,614 --> 00:06:17,992
I can sense something dark
and sinister welling up!

84
00:06:18,076 --> 00:06:21,246
Hey. This ain't over!

85
00:06:23,873 --> 00:06:25,917
[ASTA]
It's just like that guy.

86
00:06:30,922 --> 00:06:32,966
[ASTA] At this rate, he's
gonna turn into somethin'

87
00:06:33,049 --> 00:06:34,676
that's not an elf at all.

88
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:36,845
Somethin' that's actually evil!

89
00:06:39,305 --> 00:06:41,558
You took them all.

90
00:06:41,641 --> 00:06:45,061
Everyone who was precious to me.

91
00:06:45,145 --> 00:06:48,189
You killed them! That's why...

92
00:06:48,273 --> 00:06:51,735
I swear I'll make you pay!

93
00:06:51,818 --> 00:06:54,112
[ASTA] I don't know what
you're talkin' about,

94
00:06:54,195 --> 00:06:57,198
but if humans are to blame
for what happened, I'm sorry!

95
00:06:57,282 --> 00:06:59,159
I really mean it!

96
00:06:59,242 --> 00:07:01,661
But Luck, he's precious to us!

97
00:07:01,745 --> 00:07:05,081
We're friends! And we wouldn't
ever wanna lose him!

98
00:07:05,165 --> 00:07:08,543
So please, don't take him away!

99
00:07:08,626 --> 00:07:09,836
That's right!

100
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,464
Let go of him
before it's too late!

101
00:07:12,547 --> 00:07:14,215
[ASTA] I'm sure the
people you cared about

102
00:07:14,299 --> 00:07:15,759
wouldn't want you
to make someone else

103
00:07:15,842 --> 00:07:18,845
go through that same pain
you did back then!

104
00:07:18,928 --> 00:07:19,929
[LUCK groans]

105
00:07:20,013 --> 00:07:21,181
Get out!

106
00:07:21,264 --> 00:07:25,894
[LUCK screams]

107
00:07:31,274 --> 00:07:32,650
[LUCK]
Mom!

108
00:07:39,866 --> 00:07:40,700
--[ASTA] Luck!
--[VANESSA] Luck!

109
00:07:40,784 --> 00:07:42,869
[MAGNA]
Luck!

110
00:07:42,952 --> 00:07:46,247
[LUCK]
Those voices.

111
00:07:46,331 --> 00:07:50,418
I'm sorry, Mom, but I
have to go now, okay?

112
00:07:52,587 --> 00:07:56,925
I found people who
like me the way I am.

113
00:07:57,008 --> 00:07:58,635
So, goodbye.

114
00:08:00,136 --> 00:08:02,514
[LUCK]
And thank you for everything.

115
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:10,063
[YAMI] Startin' today,
you'll be a member

116
00:08:10,146 --> 00:08:12,273
of the Black Bulls.

117
00:08:12,357 --> 00:08:15,318
Go as crazy as you want,
you little brat.

118
00:08:17,487 --> 00:08:19,948
[FINRAL]
What's goin' on there, new guy?

119
00:08:22,075 --> 00:08:24,994
[VANESSA] Aw, look at
you--you're adorable!

120
00:08:25,078 --> 00:08:28,707
From now on, you can think
of me as your big sister, okay?

121
00:08:31,167 --> 00:08:32,168
[GORDON mumbling]
It's a pleasure to make

122
00:08:32,252 --> 00:08:34,462
your acquaintance,
my new friend.

123
00:08:38,258 --> 00:08:41,845
[CHARMY]
Have a bite of this! Go on!

124
00:08:41,928 --> 00:08:43,555
[GAUCHE]
This is my sister Marie.

125
00:08:43,638 --> 00:08:46,224
Yes, I know. She's a goddess.

126
00:08:46,307 --> 00:08:48,309
You can worship her
all you like.

127
00:08:50,937 --> 00:08:52,939
[ASTA] I don't care
what you think about me!

128
00:08:53,023 --> 00:08:54,524
Think whatever you want!

129
00:08:54,607 --> 00:08:57,402
But just so you know, I'm gonna
think of you as my friend.

130
00:08:57,485 --> 00:08:59,821
No, wait, as our friend!

131
00:09:01,614 --> 00:09:04,200
[NOELLE] I can't believe you're
technically my superior.

132
00:09:04,284 --> 00:09:06,828
But, since I'm royalty,
I'll overlook it.

133
00:09:08,455 --> 00:09:10,290
[MAGNA] The final isn't
gonna be between you

134
00:09:10,373 --> 00:09:14,586
and that Yuno guy.
It's between me and Luck!

135
00:09:23,636 --> 00:09:25,597
I do, too.

136
00:09:27,724 --> 00:09:29,726
I truly believe there
will soon come a day

137
00:09:29,809 --> 00:09:32,937
when all of us can exist
together in harmony.

138
00:09:33,021 --> 00:09:35,231
Let's foster understanding.

139
00:09:38,943 --> 00:09:42,113
Humans. Elves.

140
00:09:42,197 --> 00:09:44,908
I wanted to become
friends with your kind.

141
00:09:44,991 --> 00:09:47,535
I really believed that I could.

142
00:10:09,349 --> 00:10:10,767
[LUCK]
Um.

143
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:14,521
[LUCK]
Guys...

144
00:10:15,689 --> 00:10:18,400
Tell me.

145
00:10:18,483 --> 00:10:23,196
Can I still be in
the Black Bulls?

146
00:10:31,329 --> 00:10:33,373
What are you talkin' about, kid?

147
00:10:33,456 --> 00:10:35,542
'Course you can.

149
00:10:46,594 --> 00:10:50,223
[LUCK]
Magna! Vanessa! Asta!

150
00:10:50,306 --> 00:10:51,725
Thanks a lot!

151
00:10:51,808 --> 00:10:53,643
Come on!

152
00:10:56,062 --> 00:10:58,023
He can tell you to
back off all he wants,

153
00:10:58,106 --> 00:11:00,358
but he's happier than
anyone that you're okay.

154
00:11:00,442 --> 00:11:01,609
[laughs]

155
00:11:01,693 --> 00:11:05,989
We saw him hugging you,
it was adorable!

156
00:11:06,072 --> 00:11:07,991
Yeah, embrace your
feelings, Magna!

157
00:11:08,074 --> 00:11:09,451
The only thing you're
gonna be feelin'

158
00:11:09,534 --> 00:11:11,036
is my foot across
your face, ya punk!

159
00:11:11,119 --> 00:11:13,079
Aw, look, you're so embarrassed!

160
00:11:13,163 --> 00:11:14,205
[MAGNA]
Ooh, like hell I am!

161
00:11:14,289 --> 00:11:15,749
Be mature about it!

162
00:11:15,832 --> 00:11:17,542
[MAGNA]
Says the brat!

163
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:20,045
But seriously, thank you, guys.

164
00:11:20,128 --> 00:11:23,298
Oh. I guess I
messed up the town.

165
00:11:23,381 --> 00:11:24,758
I wouldn't really
call that news,

166
00:11:24,841 --> 00:11:26,176
ya little force of nature.

167
00:11:26,259 --> 00:11:29,512
I hope none of the
residents got injured.

168
00:11:29,596 --> 00:11:31,556
[VANESSA]
I made sure they were all safe.

169
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:33,183
No need to fret.

170
00:11:33,266 --> 00:11:35,518
That's good, thank you
so much, Vanessa.

171
00:11:35,602 --> 00:11:37,812
[MAGNA]
Uh. Don't I deserve some credit?

172
00:11:37,896 --> 00:11:39,147
Yeah, I guess.

173
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:41,274
What the hell do you
mean "Yeah I guess"?

174
00:11:41,358 --> 00:11:44,861
Explosive Scat-- Ah, crap,
I'm all outta juice.

175
00:11:44,944 --> 00:11:46,279
[laughs]

176
00:11:46,363 --> 00:11:48,448
[BOTH]
And you! Asta!

177
00:11:48,531 --> 00:11:49,574
What'd I do?

178
00:11:49,657 --> 00:11:50,867
What's with the sword?

179
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,619
[ASTA]
Huh? This thing?

180
00:11:52,702 --> 00:11:55,038
[VANESSA]
It turned Luck back to normal!

181
00:11:55,121 --> 00:11:57,999
[ASTA] The way Yuno put it,
it takes somebody's magic

182
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:00,043
and sucks it out, I guess?

183
00:12:00,126 --> 00:12:01,878
So basically, it's like
the spell was never cast

184
00:12:01,961 --> 00:12:04,631
in the first place,
or somethin' like that.

185
00:12:04,714 --> 00:12:05,965
[VANESSA]
What does that mean?

186
00:12:06,049 --> 00:12:07,384
[ASTA]
I'm not sure.

187
00:12:07,467 --> 00:12:09,135
And it doesn't
work automatically.

188
00:12:09,219 --> 00:12:10,178
But if I have some time,

189
00:12:10,261 --> 00:12:12,138
I can undo the
Reincarnation spell!

190
00:12:12,222 --> 00:12:15,058
[MAGNA]
That's freakin' awesome!

191
00:12:15,141 --> 00:12:17,811
But... I realize now.

192
00:12:17,894 --> 00:12:22,315
These elves aren't bad guys.
Not at heart, anyway.

193
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,859
And the one that
was controlling Luck.

194
00:12:24,943 --> 00:12:28,196
He's gone. Does that mean
that he died again?

195
00:12:30,073 --> 00:12:33,326
He was smiling at the end.

196
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:40,625
I sensed a kind person.
That was his true self.

197
00:12:40,709 --> 00:12:43,336
I think it's good
that you set him free.

198
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:47,424
This whole thing--it's
so sad, and scary, too.

199
00:12:47,507 --> 00:12:48,967
Got that right.

200
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:52,595
I promise, for the sake
of the elves and the humans.

201
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:54,931
I'll use this new sword
to bring everyone back!

202
00:12:55,015 --> 00:12:56,182
[LUCK]
Yeah!

203
00:12:56,266 --> 00:12:58,893
Wait, did you just say
"bring everyone back"?

204
00:12:58,977 --> 00:13:00,228
It's true.

205
00:13:00,311 --> 00:13:02,313
A bunch of people are
being controlled by elves.

206
00:13:02,397 --> 00:13:03,565
They're on the offensive!

207
00:13:03,648 --> 00:13:06,526
--Seriously? This is a crisis!
--[VANESSA] Huh?

208
00:13:06,609 --> 00:13:09,154
Wait. That's why all
those flashes of light

209
00:13:09,237 --> 00:13:11,156
shot up into the sky.

210
00:13:11,239 --> 00:13:14,659
There were a lot of them
around the capital.

211
00:13:14,743 --> 00:13:18,621
[MAGNA] The giant rock thing
was headed that way, too.

212
00:13:18,705 --> 00:13:20,081
We have to go!

213
00:13:20,165 --> 00:13:22,208
The Clover Kingdom
needs protection!

214
00:13:22,292 --> 00:13:23,918
[VANESSA]
Yes. But before we do that,

215
00:13:24,002 --> 00:13:25,587
we'd better return
to base and regroup

216
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,380
with the rest
of the Black Bulls.

217
00:13:27,464 --> 00:13:28,548
[ASTA]
Yeah!

218
00:13:28,631 --> 00:13:30,925
Don't worry! I can
get us there in no time!

219
00:13:32,218 --> 00:13:36,139
[MAGNA, ASTA, VANESSA screaming]

220
00:13:36,222 --> 00:13:37,891
My body remembers
how the mana felt

221
00:13:37,974 --> 00:13:40,643
when that elf kid was with me.

222
00:13:40,727 --> 00:13:43,188
I bet I can get even stronger!

223
00:13:43,271 --> 00:13:44,356
Go ahead!

224
00:13:44,439 --> 00:13:45,815
'Cause that means
I'm just gonna become

225
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:47,942
that much stronger than you!

226
00:13:48,026 --> 00:13:50,862
Good idea! And if you want,
I'd be happy to train you!

227
00:13:50,945 --> 00:13:52,572
[laughs]

228
00:13:52,655 --> 00:13:55,700
[MAGNA]
You cocky little brat!

229
00:13:56,701 --> 00:13:58,244
[LUCK]
Almost there!

230
00:13:58,328 --> 00:13:59,537
[gasps]

231
00:14:08,004 --> 00:14:09,422
[LUCK]
What happened?

232
00:14:09,506 --> 00:14:11,758
Everything's been trashed.

233
00:14:11,841 --> 00:14:14,761
[ASTA] Don't tell me
the elves got to it!

234
00:14:14,844 --> 00:14:16,429
[BLACK BULL'S BEASTS growl]

235
00:14:16,513 --> 00:14:18,932
Asta!

236
00:14:19,015 --> 00:14:20,016
Oh, hey.

237
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,601
Wait, who's been
feeding all of you?

238
00:14:21,685 --> 00:14:24,312
[VANESSA]
The captain's magical beasts.

239
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:25,772
I'm glad you're safe.

240
00:14:25,855 --> 00:14:27,899
So, where's everybody else?

241
00:14:27,982 --> 00:14:31,736
Over there? Hey! You guys!

242
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,113
[GORDON muttering]

243
00:14:33,196 --> 00:14:35,740
--[GREY] I'm so embarrassed!
--Oh... hey...

244
00:14:35,824 --> 00:14:36,950
[ASTA]
They're in shock!

245
00:14:37,033 --> 00:14:39,035
No, wait, they're
always like that!

246
00:14:39,119 --> 00:14:40,370
[mumbling] They were
not our friends!

247
00:14:40,453 --> 00:14:42,038
[HENRY]
Let... me... tell... you...

248
00:14:42,122 --> 00:14:45,125
[MAGNA]
Huh? Who's that weirdo?

249
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:47,293
Listen! I'm really
gonna need you to try

250
00:14:47,377 --> 00:14:49,254
to use your words
for once, okay?

251
00:14:49,337 --> 00:14:50,964
[BOTH]
Ah! Asta's here!

252
00:14:51,047 --> 00:14:53,383
And Luck, and Vanessa,
and Magna, too!

253
00:14:53,466 --> 00:14:55,719
[GORDON mumbling] It's good
to have you back safely!

254
00:14:55,802 --> 00:14:59,139
[LUCK laughs] Wow, what
happened to this place?

255
00:14:59,222 --> 00:15:00,890
Well...

256
00:15:00,974 --> 00:15:03,143
[MAGNA]
And you! What's your story?

257
00:15:03,226 --> 00:15:06,521
Welcome... back... Magna...

258
00:15:06,604 --> 00:15:07,856
How do you know my name?

259
00:15:07,939 --> 00:15:09,941
I think I'd remember
meetin' you, bedhead!

260
00:15:10,025 --> 00:15:12,068
[MAGNA groans]

261
00:15:12,152 --> 00:15:13,737
What the hell?

262
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,406
The last of my mana's
drainin' away. How?

263
00:15:16,489 --> 00:15:18,742
--Your... magic...
--[MAGNA] That's it!

264
00:15:18,825 --> 00:15:21,411
[ASTA] Wait, don't hurt him,
he's not an enemy!

265
00:15:21,494 --> 00:15:23,246
He owns the place!

266
00:15:23,329 --> 00:15:25,415
In fact, he's been here
longer than anyone!

267
00:15:25,498 --> 00:15:26,791
He's got some disease
that wears down

268
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:29,419
people's magic power.
Say hello to Henry!

269
00:15:29,502 --> 00:15:30,587
--[MAGNA] Huh?
--[VANESSA] Henry?

270
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,422
[laughs]

271
00:15:32,505 --> 00:15:33,715
This guy's a great friend.

272
00:15:33,798 --> 00:15:35,425
He used to come and
visit me all the time!

273
00:15:35,508 --> 00:15:36,718
And because I don't
have any magic,

274
00:15:36,801 --> 00:15:38,678
his disease didn't
affect me at all!

275
00:15:38,762 --> 00:15:39,846
To tell ya the truth,

276
00:15:39,929 --> 00:15:41,806
I kinda thought he
was a ghost at first.

277
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:45,894
I... like... Asta! Lots!

278
00:15:45,977 --> 00:15:50,065
He's... my... friend...
I... missed... him!

279
00:15:50,148 --> 00:15:51,649
This is so crazy!

280
00:15:51,733 --> 00:15:53,485
I really thought everybody
knew about Henry

281
00:15:53,568 --> 00:15:54,611
from the beginning.

282
00:15:54,694 --> 00:15:57,072
I prob'ly shoulda
said somethin', huh?

283
00:15:57,155 --> 00:15:58,740
I can't believe he's
been creepin' around

284
00:15:58,823 --> 00:16:00,200
our base this whole time.

285
00:16:00,283 --> 00:16:01,826
Kind of makes you
wonder if this place

286
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,328
has any other secrets.

287
00:16:03,411 --> 00:16:05,080
[laughs]

288
00:16:05,163 --> 00:16:07,040
Hey! We still don't
know what happened here!

289
00:16:07,123 --> 00:16:08,041
[muttering] Mutter,
mutter, mutter, mutter.

290
00:16:08,124 --> 00:16:09,209
[GREY]
Oh, no. Oh, gosh.

291
00:16:09,292 --> 00:16:10,794
I... I didn't know!

292
00:16:10,877 --> 00:16:14,422
Could at least one
of you learn to talk?

293
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:19,719
No way. Gauche, too?
He's been possessed?

294
00:16:19,803 --> 00:16:22,597
[MAGNA] I know this is serious,
but how did you get that?

295
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:24,265
[muttering] Mutter, mutter,
mutter, mutter, mutter, mutter.

296
00:16:24,349 --> 00:16:25,600
Yeah, I know, but remember,

297
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:27,102
there's another person
controlling him.

298
00:16:27,185 --> 00:16:28,520
It's not like he attacked
the base because

299
00:16:28,603 --> 00:16:30,188
he doesn't wanna
be friends anymore!

300
00:16:30,271 --> 00:16:31,856
Whimper. Whimper!

301
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,566
That's what I think, too, Grey!

302
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:35,026
The fact that he didn't
kill you guys then

303
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,778
and there probably means
that the real Gauche

304
00:16:36,861 --> 00:16:38,697
is still fighting for control!

305
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:41,408
After... that...

306
00:16:41,491 --> 00:16:43,368
[ASTA] Gauche headed
for the royal capital?

307
00:16:43,451 --> 00:16:45,453
[MAGNA] How do you
understand any of this?

308
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:47,956
We have to bring
Gauche to his senses.

309
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:49,916
But I'm all out of magic power.

310
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,710
You two should rest up.

311
00:16:51,793 --> 00:16:53,920
Asta and I can take care of it.

312
00:16:54,004 --> 00:16:56,464
Just hang in there
a little longer, Gauche!

313
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:58,967
[rumbling]

314
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:00,218
[MAGNA]
Whoa.

315
00:17:00,301 --> 00:17:02,762
Whatever that is, it's
makin' the ground shake!

316
00:17:02,846 --> 00:17:06,141
Oh, no. The magic
power's overwhelming!

--[growling]
--Who did it?

321
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:23,199
Charmy's been
turned into an elf?

322
00:17:23,283 --> 00:17:25,118
Not her, too!

323
00:17:25,201 --> 00:17:26,578
[CHARMY]
I'm furious!

324
00:17:26,661 --> 00:17:28,079
Who destroyed
the vegetable garden

325
00:17:28,163 --> 00:17:29,706
that I was growing back there?

326
00:17:29,789 --> 00:17:31,541
I want names!

327
00:17:31,624 --> 00:17:33,084
[ASTA]
Wait, nope, she's normal!

328
00:17:33,168 --> 00:17:34,711
[MAGNA, VANESSA]
Oh, that's good!

329
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:37,922
[CHARMY] Do you understand
how much effort

330
00:17:38,006 --> 00:17:39,341
I put into that garden?

331
00:17:39,424 --> 00:17:41,092
I fertilized it and
watered it and gave it

332
00:17:41,176 --> 00:17:42,469
all my love and care!

333
00:17:42,552 --> 00:17:44,429
I went out searching
for yummy snacks

334
00:17:44,512 --> 00:17:46,306
to share with you guys,
then rushed straight home

335
00:17:46,389 --> 00:17:48,850
even though I was starving,
and this is the thanks I get?

336
00:17:48,933 --> 00:17:50,602
I'm disgusted!

337
00:17:50,685 --> 00:17:52,604
You mean that noise
was your stomach?

338
00:17:52,687 --> 00:17:56,399
Well, sauce isn't enough
to satisfy my appetite!

339
00:17:56,483 --> 00:17:58,068
[ASTA]
That was sauce?!

340
00:17:58,151 --> 00:18:02,655
So, are you three responsible
for the veggie massacre?

341
00:18:02,739 --> 00:18:04,908
Uh, no, of course
not! That's cruel!

342
00:18:04,991 --> 00:18:06,201
We would never!

343
00:18:06,284 --> 00:18:08,370
All right, then who was it?

344
00:18:08,453 --> 00:18:10,997
[ASTA] Um. I think it was
the Eye of the Midnight Sun

345
00:18:11,081 --> 00:18:12,290
and some elves.

346
00:18:12,374 --> 00:18:16,211
Eye of the Midnight Sun
and some elves?

347
00:18:16,294 --> 00:18:17,712
Then come with me, everyone.

We're gonna give those jerks
a beating they won't forget!

Uh, believe me,
I'd love to join you,

350
00:18:22,842 --> 00:18:24,636
but I'm fresh out of
magic at the moment.

351
00:18:24,719 --> 00:18:26,930
Yeah, I'm runnin' pretty
low, too, actually.

352
00:18:27,013 --> 00:18:30,141
Huh? You mean you can't
help avenge my garden?

353

[VANESSA]
Sorry.

Hurry! Get cooking!

[VANESSA]
Why, though?

360
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:46,074
We don't have time to
stuff our faces right now!

361
00:18:46,157 --> 00:18:48,535
We should get to the capital!

362
00:18:48,618 --> 00:18:50,120
I don't know about this.

363

Eat.

I'm so confused!

Okay, I guess I am
a little bit hungry.

Uh, thanks for the food!

Well?

This is delicious, Charmy!

[mumbling] Friendship is
the special seasoning

that makes everything
even tastier!

My magic's coming back!

00:19:21,067 --> 00:19:22,360
That's right,
the more you consume

00:19:22,444 --> 00:19:23,695
the Head Chef's
cooking, the more

379
00:19:23,778 --> 00:19:25,238
your magic power increases!

There's that intense mana again!

[ASTA]
Yeah, you're amazing!

00:19:31,161 --> 00:19:33,371
Now we can set off
for the capital!

[CHARMY]
Keep eating!

00:19:34,539 --> 00:19:37,000
I want everyone
to clean their plates!

386
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:39,544
But go slow! Savor the flavor!

387
00:19:39,627 --> 00:19:40,795
[ASTA]
Maybe after this I'll finally

388
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:43,506
have some magic power!

389
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,383
[CHARMY]
You can't multiply by zero!

390
00:19:45,467 --> 00:19:48,553
But don't stop eating it!

391
00:19:48,636 --> 00:19:51,222
[ASTA]
Then I'll just eat my feelings!

392
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:53,767
You should get in on this,
Henry, it's pretty yummy!

But... I'll... absorb...

keep scarfin' it down!
