1
00:00:23,763 --> 00:00:25,724
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:25,807 --> 00:00:28,601
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:32,105 --> 00:00:34,399
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:34,482 --> 00:00:37,068
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:43,533 --> 00:00:45,577
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,664
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,419
[NARRATOR] The castle was
infiltrated by Langris,

8
00:00:54,502 --> 00:00:56,254
as well as others
from the Golden Dawn

9
00:00:56,338 --> 00:00:58,548
who had been possessed by elves.

10
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:01,468
[NARRATOR]
Yami and Finral were soon forced

11
00:01:01,551 --> 00:01:03,970
into a harrowing battle.

12
00:01:04,054 --> 00:01:05,513
[MAGIC KNIGHT 107A] It doesn't
matter how many of you

13
00:01:05,597 --> 00:01:08,725
there are--you'll
never overpower us!

14
00:01:08,808 --> 00:01:12,687
[cackles] You're exactly
the ones I want to slice up.

15
00:01:12,771 --> 00:01:14,981
So thanks for coming out!

16
00:01:15,065 --> 00:01:17,859
[NARRATOR] With Jack's aid,
they gained the upper hand.

17
00:01:17,942 --> 00:01:19,944
[GOLEM ARMOR groans]

18
00:01:20,028 --> 00:01:22,364
[NARRATOR] After regrouping
with Nozel and the others,

19
00:01:22,447 --> 00:01:24,115
the team entered the castle.

20
00:01:24,199 --> 00:01:26,993
But Kivn had already
invaded the Silvas' home,

21
00:01:27,077 --> 00:01:29,829
where she attacked
Solid and Nebra.

22
00:01:29,913 --> 00:01:32,290
[SOLID]
No!

23
00:01:34,876 --> 00:01:37,003
Nozel, it's you!

24
00:01:37,087 --> 00:01:38,213
And Noelle!

25
00:01:38,296 --> 00:01:42,175
Water Creation Magic:
Sea Dragon's Roar!

26
00:01:42,258 --> 00:01:45,762
[KIVN]
Compass Magic: Another Atlas!

27
00:01:45,845 --> 00:01:48,098
[NARRATOR] Nozel and
Noelle joined the fray,

28
00:01:48,181 --> 00:01:50,767
but Kivn's Compass
Magic took a toll.

29
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:53,019
Stop her, Nozel! Please!

30
00:01:53,103 --> 00:01:54,771
Stay there, Solid.

31
00:01:54,854 --> 00:01:57,399
You'd only hold us
back as you are now.

32
00:01:57,482 --> 00:01:59,234
I will handle this.

33
00:03:47,175 --> 00:03:50,845
[SOLID]
Mother! Mother!

34
00:03:50,929 --> 00:03:53,932
[giggles]

35
00:04:05,402 --> 00:04:09,072
You could at least try to
fight back, little slowpoke.

36
00:04:12,742 --> 00:04:13,868
[yelps]

37
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:15,245
That's odd! I thought
I trained you better

38
00:04:15,328 --> 00:04:17,914
than to start eating
before I do!

39
00:04:17,997 --> 00:04:21,167
If it makes you angry,
then do something about it.

40
00:04:25,213 --> 00:04:26,923
[NEBRA]
With a face like that,

41
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:29,175
it must be hard
to look in the mirror.

42
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:31,803
You're lucky I'm always
so kind to you.

43
00:04:35,724 --> 00:04:39,144
That sad grimoire of yours
is practically paper-thin.

44
00:04:39,227 --> 00:04:41,438
Are you sure you're
really royalty?

45
00:04:41,521 --> 00:04:44,107
Not being able to
control your own magic.

46
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:47,027
That's the most pitiful
thing I've ever heard.

47
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,154
And this wretch
is my little sister?

48
00:04:49,237 --> 00:04:50,572
Embarrassing!

49
00:04:50,655 --> 00:04:53,116
[NOZEL] You will never
be a member of my squad.

50
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,786
There is no room in the Silver
Eagles for a disgrace like you.

51
00:05:01,332 --> 00:05:03,084
[SOLID]
So sad.

52
00:05:03,168 --> 00:05:04,627
Pitiful!

53
00:05:04,711 --> 00:05:06,421
And would you believe the
girl's been going outside

54
00:05:06,504 --> 00:05:08,256
alone every night
so that she can practice

55
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,258
her abilities on a dead tree?

56
00:05:10,342 --> 00:05:12,719
The best part is,
she always misses!

57
00:05:12,802 --> 00:05:14,888
Every once in a while,
a spell will backfire on her

58
00:05:14,971 --> 00:05:17,807
and she ends up soaked!
It's hilarious!

59
00:05:17,891 --> 00:05:19,267
[NEBRA laughs]
Really?

60
00:05:19,351 --> 00:05:21,394
I couldn't even
do that as a joke!

61
00:05:21,478 --> 00:05:22,896
She's talented!

62
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:25,065
Talented at being
a failure, that is.

63
00:05:25,148 --> 00:05:28,276
I hate that she
and I are related.

64
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,778
Noelle.

65
00:05:29,861 --> 00:05:32,530
I have decided which Magic
Knight squad you'll be joining.

66
00:05:32,614 --> 00:05:33,698
[NOELLE]
Huh?

67
00:05:33,782 --> 00:05:35,200
[BOTH gasp]

68
00:05:35,283 --> 00:05:38,578
[NOZEL] You'll be a Black Bull.
It's already been settled.

69
00:05:38,661 --> 00:05:39,788
[NOELLE]
What?

70
00:05:39,871 --> 00:05:42,749
Ah, the Black Bulls,
the worst of them all!

71
00:05:42,832 --> 00:05:44,209
How very fitting.

72
00:05:44,292 --> 00:05:47,170
They only do small missions
in the sticks, don't they?

73
00:05:47,253 --> 00:05:50,674
Like hunting boars?
Just your speed, Noelle!

74
00:05:50,757 --> 00:05:54,886
[NEBRA, SOLID laugh]

75
00:06:06,773 --> 00:06:11,236
[NOELLE] It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

76
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:14,906
I went through all that
training. I'll succeed.

77
00:06:14,989 --> 00:06:16,783
I can do it!

78
00:06:16,866 --> 00:06:19,619
I won't let you hurt
my family anymore!

79
00:06:21,204 --> 00:06:23,832
Let's show her
our power, Noelle.

80
00:06:23,915 --> 00:06:26,292
The House Silva stands strong!

81
00:06:28,294 --> 00:06:29,546
Right!

82
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:30,839
Ha!

83
00:06:32,298 --> 00:06:33,258
[gasps]

84
00:06:33,341 --> 00:06:34,467
[gasps]

85
00:06:34,551 --> 00:06:37,929
Unfortunately for you,
this is a sealed space.

86
00:06:38,013 --> 00:06:40,223
Which means that,
no matter what you do,

87
00:06:40,306 --> 00:06:42,517
your attacks won't reach me.

88
00:06:46,938 --> 00:06:50,150
Water Creation Magic:
Sea Dragon's Lair!

89
00:06:52,402 --> 00:06:55,071
[KIVN] You're just
wasting magic and energy.

90
00:06:55,155 --> 00:06:56,406
What a shame.

91
00:06:56,489 --> 00:06:59,284
And I tried so hard to
give you a peaceful death.

92
00:07:00,744 --> 00:07:03,913
[NOELLE] She's too good.
What am I going to do?

93
00:07:03,997 --> 00:07:05,999
Even with Mana Skin,
Sea Dragon's Lair

94
00:07:06,082 --> 00:07:08,835
won't have any effect in here!

95
00:07:08,918 --> 00:07:10,628
[NOZEL]
Despite using all my strength,

96
00:07:10,712 --> 00:07:12,589
this is the best I can do.

97
00:07:14,591 --> 00:07:15,925
[yells]

98
00:07:19,721 --> 00:07:23,266
[NOZEL] All I can manage now are
simple movements at close range.

99
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:26,019
There's only one strategy.

100
00:07:26,102 --> 00:07:28,063
You're quite determined,
but I wonder

101
00:07:28,146 --> 00:07:30,565
how much longer you
can keep this up.

102
00:07:32,776 --> 00:07:35,862
[NOELLE]
He's struggling. Come on, think!

103
00:07:35,945 --> 00:07:38,114
If Asta or the other
Black Bulls were here,

104
00:07:38,198 --> 00:07:40,909
I bet they could come up
with some crazy idea!

105
00:07:42,619 --> 00:07:44,329
[screams]

106
00:07:44,412 --> 00:07:46,956
Damn it! If we don't
figure out something

107
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,794
to counteract her magic,
we'll have no way out!

108
00:07:50,877 --> 00:07:52,170
[NOELLE]
No way out?

109
00:07:55,799 --> 00:07:57,926
[NOELLE] I may not be able
to use creation magic

110
00:07:58,009 --> 00:08:01,429
in such a
controlled environment.

111
00:08:01,513 --> 00:08:04,849
But what if... I lose control!

112
00:08:06,518 --> 00:08:08,853
[NOELLE]
Nozel! Lend me a hand!

113
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,487
This is...

114
00:08:19,239 --> 00:08:20,949
[KIVN]
I don't understand!

115
00:08:22,617 --> 00:08:24,869
[KIVN]
You fool!

116
00:08:24,953 --> 00:08:28,456
You just flooded a completely
enclosed space with water!

117
00:08:31,042 --> 00:08:34,129
[KIVN] Another Atlas confines
everything within its fortress.

118
00:08:34,212 --> 00:08:36,506
If I don't want to be
drowned in my own spell,

119
00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:38,883
I have no choice
but to call it off!

120
00:08:47,726 --> 00:08:49,019
[gasps]

121
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,355
[KIVN]
You wretched human.

122
00:08:54,232 --> 00:08:55,442
[yelps]

123
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,404
[KIVN]
No. I don't believe it.

124
00:08:59,487 --> 00:09:02,157
She annihilated me
in a mere instant!

125
00:09:15,378 --> 00:09:16,671
Amazing.

126
00:09:16,755 --> 00:09:21,593
It makes sense from Nozel,
but not from her.

127
00:09:21,676 --> 00:09:25,388
Um. Guess we pulled
it off, huh, Nozel?

128
00:09:25,472 --> 00:09:28,600
Hey. I really appreciate
you going along with my idea,

129
00:09:28,683 --> 00:09:31,853
even though it was a bit of
a shot in the dark and all.

130
00:09:31,936 --> 00:09:34,105
[NOZEL]
It was certainly unorthodox.

131
00:09:34,189 --> 00:09:36,733
Fighting that way
is unbefitting of royalty.

132
00:09:36,816 --> 00:09:38,526
[NOELLE gasps]

133
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:41,613
But it still resulted
in a victory for us.

134
00:09:41,696 --> 00:09:43,490
You've learned many
impressive things

135
00:09:43,573 --> 00:09:47,285
since you joined that squad.

136
00:09:47,369 --> 00:09:49,371
I had feared, because
you look so much

137
00:09:49,454 --> 00:09:53,166
like our late mother, that I
might lose her a second time.

138
00:09:53,249 --> 00:09:56,169
[NOELLE gasps]

139
00:09:56,252 --> 00:09:57,796
[NOZEL] I didn't expect
you would ever become

140
00:09:57,879 --> 00:10:00,131
a strong person, so I decided

141
00:10:00,215 --> 00:10:04,010
that I had to protect
you at any cost.

142
00:10:04,094 --> 00:10:06,513
I tried to keep you
from the battlefield.

143
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,725
[NOZEL] But you proved
me wrong, Noelle.

144
00:10:10,809 --> 00:10:11,976
You're more capable now

145
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,354
than I ever could have
predicted you'd be.

146
00:10:16,648 --> 00:10:20,318
[clears throat]
What I mean is...

147
00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:26,700
I... I apologize, Noelle.

148
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,496
Nozel apologized?

149
00:10:31,579 --> 00:10:33,707
That's impossible!

150
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:37,127
Um. Thank you, Nozel.

151
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:39,629
[NOZEL]
We aren't out of danger yet.

152
00:10:39,713 --> 00:10:41,673
We'd better see
to Nebra's wounds.

153
00:10:41,756 --> 00:10:42,966
[NOZEL grunts]

155
00:10:46,344 --> 00:10:47,095
[NOZEL]
What?

00:10:47,178 --> 00:10:49,305
[gasps] Nozel.

157
00:10:56,604 --> 00:11:00,025
[NOELLE] How did this happen?
Please, wake up!

158
00:11:02,152 --> 00:11:04,696
I almost feel bad for you.

159
00:11:06,114 --> 00:11:10,452
You're trapped now,
here, in this place.

160
00:11:10,535 --> 00:11:16,041
There's no stopping it anymore.
It's far too vast and powerful!

161
00:11:16,124 --> 00:11:17,417
You're lying!

162
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,754
There has to be some way
to escape from this madness!

163
00:11:20,837 --> 00:11:23,298
All you can do now
is accept your fate.

164
00:11:23,381 --> 00:11:27,469
This is the price you'll pay
for your sins, royals.

165
00:11:27,552 --> 00:11:28,887
[NOELLE]
I won't give up!

166
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:31,473
There's a solution to this.
I know there is!

167
00:11:31,556 --> 00:11:34,934
Think hard, Noelle!
You can defeat her!

168
00:11:35,018 --> 00:11:37,645
You finally proved yourself
to your brother, right?

169
00:11:37,729 --> 00:11:40,148
So you can do anything!

170
00:11:40,231 --> 00:11:43,485
If you don't, Nozel and
Nebra won't make it!

171
00:11:43,568 --> 00:11:47,113
I would prefer to watch as you
gradually give into death,

172
00:11:47,197 --> 00:11:50,158
but I think I'll have mercy
on you sinful human fools

173
00:11:50,241 --> 00:11:53,370
and get this over with
quickly instead!

174
00:11:53,453 --> 00:11:55,372
[NOELLE]
They've been cruel to me.

175
00:11:55,455 --> 00:11:56,664
But still.

176
00:11:56,748 --> 00:11:59,376
I won't let her take
away my family!

177
00:12:04,047 --> 00:12:05,882
[NOELLE]
Long-range spells are out.

178
00:12:05,965 --> 00:12:08,051
Magic manipulation, too.

179
00:12:08,134 --> 00:12:10,637
I need something simple
that packs a punch.

180
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,556
Something that doesn't
need to travel far!

181
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,100
[gasps]

182
00:12:15,183 --> 00:12:18,478
[NOELLE] This is a spell I can
only use because of where I am,

183
00:12:18,561 --> 00:12:22,315
and who I am, in
this exact moment!

184
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,651
[NARRATOR] In order to
manifest a magic ability,

185
00:12:24,734 --> 00:12:29,406
the most crucial component
is the user's natural talent.

186
00:12:29,489 --> 00:12:34,160
However, unwavering effort and
training may also play a part.

187
00:12:34,244 --> 00:12:36,871
In rare cases,
a deeply heartfelt wish

188
00:12:36,955 --> 00:12:40,166
can grant power during
a time of crisis.

189
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:43,962
Many royal mages are able
to acquire spells intuitively

190
00:12:44,045 --> 00:12:45,630
by employing
their innate prowess

191
00:12:45,714 --> 00:12:48,717
and natural resourcefulness.

192
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,553
Because of their advantage,
those individuals

193
00:12:51,636 --> 00:12:53,763
rarely undergo training,
do research,

194
00:12:53,847 --> 00:12:56,558
or have their lives endangered
on the battlefield.

195
00:12:56,641 --> 00:12:58,435
Although Noelle
possessed considerable

196
00:12:58,518 --> 00:13:02,897
magic power and talent, she also
worked hard to improve herself

197
00:13:02,981 --> 00:13:04,983
and risked her life
in combat many times

198
00:13:05,066 --> 00:13:07,360
alongside the Black Bulls.

199
00:13:07,444 --> 00:13:11,031
Her longsuffering, combined
with her resolute desire

200
00:13:11,114 --> 00:13:15,410
to protect her siblings, gave
her all the power she needed

201
00:13:15,493 --> 00:13:17,912
to overcome her
current challenge!

202
00:13:31,551 --> 00:13:33,511
[NOELLE]
Water Creation Magic:

203
00:13:33,595 --> 00:13:35,388
Valkyrie Armor!

204
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,984
[gasps] Noelle!

205
00:13:48,068 --> 00:13:50,487
[KIVN]
What kind of magic is that?

206
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:53,740
She's giving off an
enormous amount of power!

207
00:13:53,823 --> 00:13:56,451
That won't be enough, royal!

208
00:14:12,133 --> 00:14:13,134
[yells]

209
00:14:16,179 --> 00:14:18,139
[KIVN]
How does she move so swiftly?

210
00:14:18,223 --> 00:14:20,725
Is she riding the mana from
my attacks and the disturbance

211
00:14:20,809 --> 00:14:22,394
they're creating
in this sealed space

212
00:14:22,477 --> 00:14:24,896
like waves on the sea?

213
00:14:24,979 --> 00:14:26,231
That armor must be a spell

214
00:14:26,314 --> 00:14:28,483
that lets her
control nearby mana!

215
00:14:30,026 --> 00:14:31,736
[KIVN]
Fine.

216
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,905
But can you avoid all of these?

217
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:38,034
[KIVN]
I still have the advantage here.

218
00:14:38,118 --> 00:14:40,662
If I can find the slightest
hole in your defense,

219
00:14:40,745 --> 00:14:44,708
this world I've created
will rip your armor clean off!

220
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:45,834
[gasps]

221
00:14:47,043 --> 00:14:49,462
[NOELLE] Just moments ago,
I was struggling.

222
00:14:51,798 --> 00:14:54,801
[NOELLE] But now, it feels like
I've burst out of my cage!

223
00:14:56,886 --> 00:15:00,515
[NOELLE] I had no idea magic
could make me feel so free!

224
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,021
[NOELLE] I wonder if this is
the same feeling my mother had.

225
00:15:11,985 --> 00:15:13,194
[gasps]

226
00:15:17,157 --> 00:15:18,324
[NOZEL]
Mother.

227
00:15:18,408 --> 00:15:21,828
The Dancing Princess
of the Battlefield.

228
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:33,715
How?

229
00:15:33,798 --> 00:15:36,676
How did you cut through
everything I threw at you?

230
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,142
It's over!

231
00:15:44,225 --> 00:15:46,019
[KIVN]
Willful Compass!

232
00:15:49,105 --> 00:15:51,274
These mana currents you
seem to dance through

233
00:15:51,358 --> 00:15:54,235
so elegantly... I'm
about to redirect them,

234
00:15:54,319 --> 00:15:57,572
and send you straight to hell!

235
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,118
You're mine now, royal brat!

236
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:12,629
[gasps] Did she overrule
my mana compulsion?

237
00:16:12,712 --> 00:16:15,173
[NOELLE]
I'm not concerned with elegance.

238
00:16:15,256 --> 00:16:19,511
This armor, anything that comes
into contact with this mana,

239
00:16:19,594 --> 00:16:22,055
is under my control!

240
00:16:22,138 --> 00:16:24,307
I'm fighting with
everything I've got,

241
00:16:24,391 --> 00:16:27,102
so I can move forward!

242
00:16:27,185 --> 00:16:30,438
I'll crush you and this
world you've made!

243
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:31,606
[KIVN groans]

244
00:16:58,008 --> 00:16:59,592
[NOELLE pants]

245
00:17:01,177 --> 00:17:02,679
Did I win?

246
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:06,891
Come on, let's get Nozel
and Nebra to safety!

247
00:17:15,442 --> 00:17:16,776
[NOELLE]
Oh, no.

248
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:19,571
I don't have enough magic
left to fight these guys!

249
00:17:19,654 --> 00:17:21,948
How dare you hurt Kivn?

250
00:17:22,032 --> 00:17:23,742
It appears we
might've underestimated

251
00:17:23,825 --> 00:17:26,578
your strength, humans.

252
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:30,081
But that will not happen again.

253
00:17:30,165 --> 00:17:31,332
Begone!

254
00:17:33,835 --> 00:17:35,503
Solid, behind you!

255
00:17:41,051 --> 00:17:43,219
[MAGIC KNIGHT 108A groans]

256
00:17:43,303 --> 00:17:46,222
See, now that's how you
do a surprise attack.

257
00:17:46,306 --> 00:17:47,390
[gasps]

258
00:17:49,392 --> 00:17:51,895
[ZORA chuckles]
Not bad, huh?

259
00:17:51,978 --> 00:17:54,022
Even better when you double it.

260
00:17:55,315 --> 00:17:57,776
What kind of magic was that?

261
00:17:57,859 --> 00:17:59,611
I've never seen
anything like it.

262
00:17:59,694 --> 00:18:02,739
Damned humans. Stay on guard!

263
00:18:02,822 --> 00:18:06,076
That last battle was
flashy, to say the least,

264
00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:08,828
so I kinda assumed it
was gonna draw a crowd.

265
00:18:08,912 --> 00:18:10,246
Zora!

266
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:13,166
[ZORA] Hey, kid! Don't you
work for these people?

267
00:18:13,249 --> 00:18:14,459
Make yourself useful!

268
00:18:14,542 --> 00:18:16,503
Huh? What's the matter with you,

269
00:18:16,586 --> 00:18:18,963
dragging me into
something this dangerous?

270
00:18:19,047 --> 00:18:21,508
I'm the guy who saved
your ass, remember?

271
00:18:21,591 --> 00:18:24,094
So you had better listen to me.

272
00:18:24,177 --> 00:18:25,595
I can't.

273
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,180
[ZORA]
You can, and you will.

274
00:18:27,263 --> 00:18:30,350
Now hop to it, kid, or you
won't have masters anymore.

275
00:18:30,433 --> 00:18:32,352
[gasps] Hey!

276
00:18:32,435 --> 00:18:35,980
It's Lord Nozel and Lady Nebra!
They need my help!

277
00:18:36,064 --> 00:18:38,817
Bubble Recovery Magic:
Bubble Refresher!

278
00:18:40,443 --> 00:18:44,823
Lord Solid, please bring
Lord Nozel over here!

279
00:18:44,906 --> 00:18:46,157
Lord Solid?

280
00:18:46,241 --> 00:18:48,702
What's wrong,
are you takin' a nap?

281
00:18:48,785 --> 00:18:51,496
Some royal Magic Knight
you are, buddy.

282
00:18:51,579 --> 00:18:54,624
How could you let this
chick beat all three of you?

283
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:56,668
Maybe if you snobs didn't
run your mouths off

284
00:18:56,751 --> 00:18:59,796
all the time,
you would fight better!

285
00:18:59,879 --> 00:19:02,048
I mean, this moron
here is a captain!

286
00:19:02,132 --> 00:19:04,759
And he couldn't even look
out for his own family!

287
00:19:08,054 --> 00:19:09,347
[ACIER]
Nozel.

288
00:19:12,976 --> 00:19:15,812
[ACIER] You're finally getting
your grimoire next year.

289
00:19:15,895 --> 00:19:17,230
I'm looking forward
to finding out

290
00:19:17,313 --> 00:19:20,191
what sorts of amazing
things you're going to do.

291
00:19:20,275 --> 00:19:22,610
I'll learn spells
of unparalleled power,

292
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:24,988
so that I can become a
strong Magic Knight Captain

293
00:19:25,071 --> 00:19:26,698
just like you are, Mother.

294
00:19:26,781 --> 00:19:28,616
[laughs] That's great.

295
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:32,370
Solid and Nebra both have Water
Magic like your father does,

296
00:19:32,454 --> 00:19:34,164
and I have a feeling
it might be the same

297
00:19:34,247 --> 00:19:36,207
for the little one, too.

298
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:38,168
The only one of my
children who inherited

299
00:19:38,251 --> 00:19:40,211
my Steel attribute
was you, dear.

300
00:19:40,295 --> 00:19:43,798
So be sure that to use it to
protect your siblings, okay?

301
00:19:47,677 --> 00:19:50,096
[NOZEL]
That's right. I should...

302
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,599
Royals like you are supposed
to be more powerful

303
00:19:52,682 --> 00:19:56,603
than us commoners, right?
Come on, show a little spirit!

304
00:19:56,686 --> 00:19:58,188
I think we've heard
quite enough out--!

305
00:19:58,271 --> 00:20:00,106
[NOZEL]
Stop.

306
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:02,734
But, Nozel. I don't...

307
00:20:02,817 --> 00:20:05,195
[NOZEL]
Everything he's saying is true.

308
00:20:05,278 --> 00:20:08,156
If I let this be the end of me,

309
00:20:08,239 --> 00:20:12,118
I'd be a disgrace to the
royal House of Silva

310
00:20:12,202 --> 00:20:14,162
and the Silver Eagles!

311
00:20:14,245 --> 00:20:16,915
[NOZEL] I'll reinforce
my body with magic.

312
00:20:16,998 --> 00:20:20,001
[NOELLE] He's can fortify
himself with Mercury Magic?

313
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:23,129
What an advanced technique!

314
00:20:23,213 --> 00:20:24,798
Are you ready, Noelle?

315
00:20:24,881 --> 00:20:25,924
Yeah!

316
00:20:26,007 --> 00:20:28,301
[ZORA chuckles]
You snooty rich kids

317
00:20:28,385 --> 00:20:31,054
have so much magic power,
it makes me sick.

318
00:20:31,137 --> 00:20:34,224
Tone it down some for
the rest of us, would ya?

319
00:20:34,307 --> 00:20:37,435
Ash Magic: Revelation
of the Cowardly.

320
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,064
[ZORA]
Now!

321
00:20:43,692 --> 00:20:46,736
Take my magic
with you, Noelle!

322
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,363
[yells]

323
00:20:50,031 --> 00:20:51,408
[yells]

324
00:20:53,284 --> 00:20:54,202
I've got you!

325
00:20:54,285 --> 00:20:55,495
Not quite.

326
00:20:57,872 --> 00:20:59,290
She's too fast!

327
00:20:59,374 --> 00:21:00,667
We'll catch her.

328
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:03,795
[ALL grunt]

329
00:21:03,878 --> 00:21:05,380
It's Trap Magic!

330
00:21:05,463 --> 00:21:07,632
And there's more
where that came from.

331
00:21:07,716 --> 00:21:09,300
[ZORA]
The Revelation of the Cowardly

332
00:21:09,384 --> 00:21:13,138
shows where I've placed
each of my trap spells.

333
00:21:13,221 --> 00:21:16,641
The second they screw up,
these royals'll be all over 'em.

334
00:21:18,768 --> 00:21:20,520
[yells]

335
00:21:21,521 --> 00:21:24,899
In that condition, you won't
be able to avoid this!

336
00:21:28,945 --> 00:21:30,238
Nozel!

337
00:21:37,746 --> 00:21:40,707
He's not fazed at all by
the strength of our spell.

338
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:44,127
What kind of magic was that?

339
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:46,880
Tch. Bunch of amateurs.

340
00:21:46,963 --> 00:21:49,174
Guess you don't know about
complicated techniques

341
00:21:49,257 --> 00:21:50,800
like my counter-traps.

342
00:21:50,884 --> 00:21:55,347
Water Creation Magic:
Sea Dragon's Roar!

343
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:59,100
It looks like your control is
starting to falter, little girl!

344
00:22:00,226 --> 00:22:02,979
Mercury Magic: Rain of Silver!

345
00:22:04,564 --> 00:22:06,524
That's nothing to me!

346
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,405
[BOTH gasp]

347
00:22:12,489 --> 00:22:15,492
[ZORA] These spells have
been evolving for years.

348
00:22:15,575 --> 00:22:17,827
It's complex human magic.

349
00:22:17,911 --> 00:22:21,289
But you elves wouldn't know
about that either, would ya?

350
00:23:57,093 --> 00:23:59,346
[FINRAL] Langris! No matter
what you think of me,

351
00:23:59,429 --> 00:24:01,306
you and I will
always be brothers,

352
00:24:01,389 --> 00:24:04,434
and nothing's gonna change that!

353
00:24:04,517 --> 00:24:08,355
<i>Black Clover</i> , Page 109:
"Spatial Mage Brothers."

354
00:24:08,438 --> 00:24:10,398
I can do it if I try my best!
