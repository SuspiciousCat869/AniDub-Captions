1
00:00:22,554 --> 00:00:27,142
[NARRATOR] Within the clover's
fifth leaf there lives a devil.

2
00:00:27,225 --> 00:00:29,686
Asta, born unable
to harness mana,

3
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:31,438
was granted the power
of Anti-magic

4
00:00:31,521 --> 00:00:33,273
from his five-leaf grimoire,

5
00:00:33,356 --> 00:00:36,693
giving him the ability
to nullify spells.

6
00:00:36,776 --> 00:00:39,404
Unfortunately, the members
of Spade Kingdom's

7
00:00:39,487 --> 00:00:42,032
Dark Triad also possess
powers from the devils

8
00:00:42,115 --> 00:00:43,908
of the underworld and used them

9
00:00:43,992 --> 00:00:47,120
to launch an invasion on
the neighboring countries.

10
00:00:47,203 --> 00:00:49,122
Gaining strength from
his belief in himself

11
00:00:49,205 --> 00:00:51,166
and from the support
of his friends,

12
00:00:51,249 --> 00:00:54,544
Asta continues to fight
for the safety of this world.

13
00:01:00,467 --> 00:01:02,552
Don't flatter yourself.

14
00:01:02,635 --> 00:01:06,139
The key to the underworld
isn't you, per se.

15
00:01:06,222 --> 00:01:07,766
It's a magical channel
that's known as

16
00:01:07,849 --> 00:01:10,310
the Tree of Qliphoth.

17
00:01:10,393 --> 00:01:12,937
[NARRATOR] Dante revealed that
creating the Tree of Qliphoth

18
00:01:13,021 --> 00:01:17,776
would require the use of both
Dark Magic and World Tree Magic.

19
00:01:17,859 --> 00:01:19,527
[YAMI]
No more chit-chat.

20
00:01:19,611 --> 00:01:22,322
I'm taking you down
here and now!

21
00:01:22,405 --> 00:01:25,033
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
all over the Heart Kingdom,

22
00:01:25,116 --> 00:01:28,995
the battles against Vanica's
Dark Disciples raged on.

23
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:32,540
[LUCK]
True Lightning Magic: Ceranos!

24
00:01:32,624 --> 00:01:36,586
[NARRATOR] First, Luck defeated
the Skin Magic user, Svenkin.

25
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:37,921
Next...

26
00:01:38,004 --> 00:01:41,091
[CHARMY]
Food Magic: Glutton's Banquet!

27
00:01:41,174 --> 00:01:43,885
[WOLF growls]

28
00:01:45,595 --> 00:01:50,600
--[WOLF] Down the hatch!
--[HALBET screams]

29
00:01:50,684 --> 00:01:53,978
[NARRATOR] Using the Mana Method
to give her Food Magic a boost,

30
00:01:54,062 --> 00:01:57,565
Charmy brought down Halbet,
wielder of Hair Magic.

31
00:01:57,649 --> 00:01:59,901
The only way to get
true beauty and strength

32
00:01:59,984 --> 00:02:02,570
is from a balanced diet!

33
00:02:02,654 --> 00:02:03,738
[SIVOIR]
What?

34
00:02:03,822 --> 00:02:05,782
Where did that enormous
array come from?

35
00:02:05,865 --> 00:02:07,450
[LEOPOLD]
I endured you so that I could

36
00:02:07,534 --> 00:02:10,704
take my time creating it!

37
00:02:10,787 --> 00:02:13,373
True Flame Magic:

38
00:02:13,456 --> 00:02:16,584
Crimson Eruption!

39
00:02:16,668 --> 00:02:19,504
[NARRATOR] Leopold, who had
obtained True Flame Magic

40
00:02:19,587 --> 00:02:21,131
thanks to the Mana Method,

41
00:02:21,214 --> 00:02:23,591
defeated the Eye Magic
user named Sivoir.

42
00:02:23,675 --> 00:02:26,886
[LEOPOLD] If you're not tough
enough to handle getting burned,

43
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,305
then don't play with an inferno!

44
00:02:29,389 --> 00:02:32,308
[SIVOIR screams]

45
00:02:32,392 --> 00:02:34,602
[NARRATOR] Hischer and his
Nail Magic were eliminated

46
00:02:34,686 --> 00:02:37,063
by the Spirit Guardian Gaja.

47
00:02:37,147 --> 00:02:40,817
[GAJA] You're finished
here, Dark Disciple.

48
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,945
[ROBERO cackles]

49
00:02:44,029 --> 00:02:45,238
[ROBERO grunts]

50
00:02:45,321 --> 00:02:48,950
[MIMOSA] Plant Magic:
Magic Cannon Flower!

51
00:02:49,034 --> 00:02:51,745
Serves you right
for being creepy!

52
00:02:51,828 --> 00:02:53,329
[NARRATOR]
Queen Loropechika was confronted

53
00:02:53,413 --> 00:02:55,540
by Tongue Magic user Robero.

54
00:02:55,623 --> 00:02:57,834
And, just as Mimosa
stopped him...

55
00:02:57,917 --> 00:03:00,420
[VANICA]
Yoo-hoo!

56
00:03:00,503 --> 00:03:03,965
Happy to see me,
little Loropechika?

57
00:03:14,684 --> 00:03:17,354
I've gotta say, this is
getting really dull.

58
00:03:17,437 --> 00:03:19,814
With the Dark Triad
out there on the offensive,

59
00:03:19,898 --> 00:03:21,775
it's been pretty quiet here.

60
00:03:21,858 --> 00:03:24,402
Yeah. Oh, there is one thing!

61
00:03:24,486 --> 00:03:26,654
I'm not sure if you heard
this already, but apparently

62
00:03:26,738 --> 00:03:29,282
we may have a spy from the
Clover Kingdom in our midst.

63
00:03:29,366 --> 00:03:32,118
[laughs] Don't be ridiculous!

64
00:03:32,202 --> 00:03:34,788
There's nobody stupid
enough to try that!

65
00:03:34,871 --> 00:03:37,082
[GUARD 165B laughs]
You're right.

66
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:50,804
[GUARD 165C]
You there.

67
00:03:50,887 --> 00:03:54,057
These are Lord Dante's quarters.
You shouldn't be here.

68
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:57,352
Unless... you were the spy
I've heard so much about.

69
00:03:57,435 --> 00:04:00,230
What do you say you and I
have a little chat downstairs?

70
00:04:05,735 --> 00:04:06,945
[GUARD 165C]
What?

71
00:04:08,405 --> 00:04:09,823
Where did you go?

72
00:04:14,035 --> 00:04:15,036
[GUARD 165C gasps]

73
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,248
[GUARD 165C screams]

74
00:06:11,528 --> 00:06:13,071
There's my Loropechika!

75
00:06:13,154 --> 00:06:15,990
Oh, and there's no reason
for you girls to be so guarded,

76
00:06:16,074 --> 00:06:18,368
she and I go way back.

77
00:06:18,451 --> 00:06:22,122
I only cursed you last time
because Megicula said to.

78
00:06:22,205 --> 00:06:24,624
Anyway, this should
be a fun visit!

79
00:06:26,292 --> 00:06:28,670
[NOELLE]
She's possessed by Megicula.

80
00:06:28,753 --> 00:06:33,133
That must mean she's
Vanica of the Dark Triad!

81
00:06:33,216 --> 00:06:36,428
She's the one who
killed my mother!

82
00:06:36,511 --> 00:06:40,098
If it's just me you're after,
then why attack Heart?

83
00:06:40,181 --> 00:06:41,683
You didn't have to get
innocent people

84
00:06:41,766 --> 00:06:44,769
involved in all this chaos!

85
00:06:44,853 --> 00:06:46,730
Oh, it's simple, really.

86
00:06:46,813 --> 00:06:50,525
I knew that would make you
want to fight me even more!

87
00:06:50,608 --> 00:06:52,235
[LOROPECHIKA gasps]

88
00:06:52,318 --> 00:06:54,154
[NOELLE]
She's heartless!

89
00:06:54,237 --> 00:06:56,197
[NOELLE] Well, you'd better
be prepared to deal with us,

90
00:06:56,281 --> 00:06:58,033
because we wiped
out your minions!

91
00:06:58,116 --> 00:06:59,284
You're the only one left!

92
00:06:59,367 --> 00:07:03,204
Yeah? So, you defeated
all of them?

93
00:07:05,749 --> 00:07:10,086
[ROBERO giggles]
Oh, boy.

94
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:12,714
That sure was a great warm-up!

95
00:07:12,797 --> 00:07:14,090
[ALL gasp]

96
00:07:14,174 --> 00:07:15,759
[MIMOSA]
What? My magic should've

97
00:07:15,842 --> 00:07:17,927
rendered him unconscious!

98
00:07:18,011 --> 00:07:19,554
I don't think I'll ever be able

99
00:07:19,637 --> 00:07:22,098
to thank you
enough, Lady Vanica.

100
00:07:22,182 --> 00:07:25,935
Because of you, I feel
neverending pleasure--

[BOTH gasp]

103
00:07:29,397 --> 00:07:31,149
Shut up already.

104
00:07:31,232 --> 00:07:32,859
Take care of these
annoying little bugs

105
00:07:32,942 --> 00:07:35,528
so I can be alone
with Loropechika.

[ROBERO giggles]
I beg you.

Please step on me
more, Lady Vanica!

110
00:07:53,338 --> 00:07:54,381
See that?

111
00:07:54,464 --> 00:07:56,299
Thanks to the curse
I put on them,

112

no matter how many times you
kill them, they just won't die!

Of course.

We've only just begun trampling
your poor little kingdom.

[SIVOIR]
You little rat.

123
00:08:32,752 --> 00:08:36,548
How dare you make me suffer
the first pain of my life?

After I was hand-selected
by Lady Vanica herself!

I am a woman of beauty!

I should never have
been put through

127

such a disgraceful
ordeal as that!

128

And so, with the
eternal gorgeousness

129

given to me by Lady Vanica,

130

I shall destroy everything!

to do their dumb speeches?

you will be stopped.

[VANICA]
Sorry, but unless you defeat me,

they'll keep coming
back to life forever.

And they won't lay off until
your whole kingdom is dead.

So, you are ready to play!

00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:37,043
[ROBERO laughs]

160
00:10:37,127 --> 00:10:41,423
Oh, Lady Vanica, both of your
magic abilities are great!

161
00:10:41,506 --> 00:10:43,591
Curse-Warding and Blood Magic.

162
00:10:43,675 --> 00:10:46,636
It's just like Loropechika
told us before!

163
00:10:50,348 --> 00:10:52,976
[NOELLE]
Loropechika! Anyone home?

164
00:10:53,059 --> 00:10:55,562
Oh, yes, hello, I'm here!

165
00:10:55,645 --> 00:11:00,734
Apologies, everyone.
I was checking on something.

166
00:11:00,817 --> 00:11:01,985
[NOELLE]
Seriously?

167
00:11:02,068 --> 00:11:04,654
Because it looked like
you were spacing out.

168
00:11:04,738 --> 00:11:06,281
Now what was that about Spade?

169
00:11:06,364 --> 00:11:09,159
Right, I was just
getting to that!

170
00:11:09,242 --> 00:11:11,703
Each member of the Dark Triad
has a combination

171
00:11:11,786 --> 00:11:13,788
of two different
magic attributes.

172
00:11:13,872 --> 00:11:18,168
Their own and the one
their devil has.

173
00:11:18,251 --> 00:11:20,003
When it comes to Vanica,

174
00:11:20,086 --> 00:11:21,713
I've fought her
and Megicula before,

175
00:11:21,796 --> 00:11:24,507
so I will come up with
a perfect strategy.

176
00:11:26,134 --> 00:11:28,595
[LOROPECHIKA]
We'll train with that in mind!

177
00:11:28,678 --> 00:11:32,515
[VANICA giggles]
Nice one, Loropechika!

178
00:11:32,599 --> 00:11:36,311
I wonder if Dante and Zenon
are having as much fun as me!

179
00:11:36,394 --> 00:11:39,856
Nah, whatever those two are
doing, this is ten times better!

180
00:11:39,939 --> 00:11:43,693
'Cause Loropechika's here,
and I can kill her if I want to!

181
00:11:43,777 --> 00:11:46,154
Sorry, that won't
be happening today.

182
00:11:46,237 --> 00:11:48,073
Because I'm here, too!

183
00:11:50,617 --> 00:11:52,118
[gasps]

184
00:11:52,202 --> 00:11:54,245
I guess it'd be cool
to have Dark Magic

185
00:11:54,329 --> 00:11:55,955
and World Tree Magic.

186
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:58,667
But if you ask me, it sounds
like it'd be too much of a pain

187
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:02,045
to drag those two
back alive! [laughs]

188
00:12:02,128 --> 00:12:04,255
[NOELLE]
Wait, Dark Magic?

189
00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:06,508
What do you mean by
"dragging them back?"

190
00:12:06,591 --> 00:12:09,135
What are you guys
plotting? Tell me now!

191
00:12:09,219 --> 00:12:13,890
Ugh. Do you honestly believe
I'm going to tell you anything?

192
00:12:17,977 --> 00:12:19,938
[LOROPECHIKA]
World Tree Magic.

193
00:12:20,021 --> 00:12:21,606
Dark Magic.

194
00:12:23,274 --> 00:12:24,984
[NARRATOR] The Queen of
the Heart Kingdom inherits

195
00:12:25,068 --> 00:12:27,070
the previous queens' powers,

196
00:12:27,153 --> 00:12:30,323
as well as their knowledge
and experiences.

197
00:12:30,407 --> 00:12:33,159
Here, inside
Loropechika's mind,

198
00:12:33,243 --> 00:12:36,913
is where that colossal mountain
of information materializes.

199
00:12:36,996 --> 00:12:38,998
It is because of this place

200
00:12:39,082 --> 00:12:41,501
that the queen is called
the "All-Knowing Priestess."

201
00:12:41,584 --> 00:12:43,253
[LOROPECHIKA gasps]

202
00:12:56,391 --> 00:12:59,060
It's so cruel.

203
00:12:59,144 --> 00:13:00,937
Loropechika!

204
00:13:01,021 --> 00:13:02,397
[LOROPECHIKA]
Listen, Noelle.

205
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,027
If we let the Dark Triad
have their way,

206
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:09,070
they're going to open
the door to the underworld

207
00:13:09,154 --> 00:13:11,239
and release the devils,
killing more

208
00:13:11,322 --> 00:13:14,617
than 90 percent of the
people on this continent.

209
00:13:14,701 --> 00:13:16,953
And the world will end!

210
00:13:17,037 --> 00:13:18,580
But that's insane!

211
00:13:25,462 --> 00:13:27,297
[gasps]

212
00:13:40,393 --> 00:13:43,063
It's so cruel.

213
00:13:43,146 --> 00:13:44,981
Loropechika!

214
00:13:45,065 --> 00:13:47,025
[LOROPECHIKA]
Listen, Noelle.

215
00:13:47,108 --> 00:13:50,945
If we let the Dark Triad
have their way,

216
00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:52,947
they're going to open
the door to the underworld

217
00:13:53,031 --> 00:13:55,075
and release the devils,
killing more

218
00:13:55,158 --> 00:13:58,536
than 90 percent of the
people on this continent.

219
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,955
And the world will end!

220
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:02,749
But that's insane!

221
00:14:06,586 --> 00:14:09,214
How can you do
something like this?

222
00:14:09,297 --> 00:14:11,216
So many people will die!

223
00:14:11,299 --> 00:14:13,760
Yes, but the ones left
behind will be strong,

224
00:14:13,843 --> 00:14:16,304
and my blood will boil
along with theirs!

225
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:20,725
What's the big deal if
the weaker ones die off?

226
00:14:20,809 --> 00:14:23,895
Anyway, forget about the
future--let's enjoy the now!

227
00:14:23,978 --> 00:14:25,397
Enough!

228
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:31,027
We can't allow monsters like you
to roam free in this land!

229
00:14:31,111 --> 00:14:34,739
Which is why we will defeat
you once and for all!

230
00:14:36,991 --> 00:14:39,077
[LOROPECHIKA]
The fate of existence itself

231
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,954
is in our hands.

232
00:14:41,037 --> 00:14:43,707
Mana Zone plus Mana Method.

233
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,875
Water Spirit Magic...

234
00:14:49,754 --> 00:14:51,965
[LOROPECHIKA]
...Ludic Sanctuary!

235
00:14:56,261 --> 00:14:59,264
With this technique,
your Blood Magic's efficacy

236
00:14:59,347 --> 00:15:01,182
will be cut in half.

237
00:15:01,266 --> 00:15:04,894
And Noelle's water-based attacks
will increase in power!

238
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:11,109
Stronger. I need to be stronger!

239
00:15:11,192 --> 00:15:13,153
What now?

240
00:15:13,236 --> 00:15:15,321
The lighter your armor is,
the more easily

241
00:15:15,405 --> 00:15:17,407
you can become one
with the water!

242
00:15:23,371 --> 00:15:24,831
[gasps]

243
00:15:24,914 --> 00:15:27,250
[LOROPECHIKA] This should also
help you move more fluidly!

244
00:15:27,334 --> 00:15:30,086
You'll be swifter
than ever before!

245
00:15:37,344 --> 00:15:40,305
[NOELLE]
Valkyrie Armor: Mermaid Form!

246
00:15:41,681 --> 00:15:43,558
[NOELLE]
You've destroyed so much.

247
00:15:43,641 --> 00:15:46,394
But the damage stops
right here and now!

248
00:15:48,271 --> 00:15:49,647
[LOROPECHIKA gasps]

249
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:55,403
[giggles] Well,
just look at you!

250
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:59,074
It's so cute that little
Loropechika found a buddy!

251
00:15:59,157 --> 00:16:01,242
This'll be double
the fun for me!

252
00:16:01,326 --> 00:16:03,411
[gasps]

253
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:06,039
[VANICA]
Try not to die too fast.

254
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:13,004
Devil Power,
50-percent strength!

255
00:16:13,088 --> 00:16:14,964
[LOROPECHIKA] Her blood
can't harden as easily,

256
00:16:15,048 --> 00:16:16,966
but that's not slowing her down!

257
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:19,844
I knew it. We can't win
with normal attacks!

258
00:16:19,928 --> 00:16:20,887
Noelle!

259
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:22,764
[giggles]

260
00:16:28,895 --> 00:16:31,272
[laughing]

00:16:32,232 --> 00:16:33,775
[laughing]

262
00:16:33,858 --> 00:16:36,695
All right, now things
are getting real!

263
00:16:36,778 --> 00:16:38,863
Fifty-one percent!

264
00:16:42,033 --> 00:16:43,827
[NOELLE]
She only went up by one percent,

265
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,995
but she's so much stronger!

266
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,706
All you think about
is satisfying

267
00:16:47,789 --> 00:16:49,582
your own twisted desires!

268
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:52,711
[laughing] Fifty-two percent!

269
00:16:52,794 --> 00:16:55,338
You don't even think about
the people you've hurt!

270
00:16:55,422 --> 00:16:59,342
You killed my mother, Acier
Silva of the Clover Kingdom!

271
00:16:59,426 --> 00:17:01,553
[VANICA]
Fifty-three percent!

272
00:17:01,636 --> 00:17:03,054
Yeah, who's that?

273
00:17:03,138 --> 00:17:05,807
Talking about the past
is pointless and boring!

274
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:08,268
Let's enjoy the
moment, shall we?

275
00:17:11,187 --> 00:17:14,983
[ROBERO laughs]
I wish you'd give up

276
00:17:15,066 --> 00:17:18,111
and take your licks
already, pretty girl.

277
00:17:18,194 --> 00:17:22,741
Thanks to Lady Vanica, we're
never gonna die, remember?

278
00:17:22,824 --> 00:17:24,325
We've trained so hard.

279
00:17:24,409 --> 00:17:28,079
Trust me, there's no way we'll
be defeated by the likes of you!

280
00:17:28,163 --> 00:17:30,623
[MIMOSA]
Not just for the world.

281
00:17:30,707 --> 00:17:33,585
[NOELLE] Not just to avenge
the death of my mother.

282
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:40,884
[MIMOSA grunts]

283
00:17:45,305 --> 00:17:48,058
[MIMOSA] You really are
incredible, Loropechika!

284
00:17:48,141 --> 00:17:51,061
With your help, our magic
will be unstoppable!

285
00:17:51,144 --> 00:17:52,562
[NOELLE]
Uh, yeah, sure.

286
00:17:52,645 --> 00:17:54,397
I guess you had
something to do with it.

287
00:17:54,481 --> 00:17:58,151
Well, what did you expect?
Loropechika's that amazing!

288
00:17:58,234 --> 00:18:01,654
Oh, no, not at all!
I'm not special.

289
00:18:01,738 --> 00:18:05,033
Forget the modesty,
it comes off as fake.

290
00:18:05,116 --> 00:18:07,118
But I'm only this capable
because I inherited

291
00:18:07,202 --> 00:18:09,162
all of my abilities and
mana from the queens

292
00:18:09,245 --> 00:18:11,414
who ruled the Heart
Kingdom before me.

293
00:18:11,498 --> 00:18:14,292
Even so, your powers
are unbelievably great!

294
00:18:14,376 --> 00:18:17,170
They can't be inherited
by just anyone, dear.

295
00:18:17,253 --> 00:18:18,880
[LOROPECHIKA] Because
I'm so clumsy and goofy,

296
00:18:18,963 --> 00:18:21,925
I can't help but wonder
to myself sometimes.

297
00:18:22,008 --> 00:18:24,678
Am I really worthy
of the crown I wear?

298
00:18:26,096 --> 00:18:28,098
[LOROPECHIKA]
Last time, when I fought Vanica

299
00:18:28,181 --> 00:18:31,768
and the devil Megicula,
I was scared.

300
00:18:31,851 --> 00:18:36,106
And because of that,
I was cursed.

301
00:18:36,189 --> 00:18:38,274
I'm unfit to be a queen.

302
00:18:39,776 --> 00:18:41,820
[LOROPECHIKA laughs]
But when I'm with you,

303
00:18:41,903 --> 00:18:44,989
I forget about my status
and things like that.

304
00:18:45,073 --> 00:18:46,908
I feel like I can be honest.

305
00:18:46,991 --> 00:18:49,452
I wonder why.

306
00:18:49,536 --> 00:18:52,664
What I'm about to tell you
will probably make me seem

307
00:18:52,747 --> 00:18:54,833
even more undeserving.

308
00:18:56,042 --> 00:18:58,586
[LOROPECHIKA]
But...

309
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,338
But I'm so afraid!

310
00:19:00,422 --> 00:19:03,216
I don't want to die!

311
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:06,052
As the queen, I'm supposed
to be so much stronger

312
00:19:06,136 --> 00:19:10,598
and more responsible,
but... I...

313
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:13,435
Ah! I do apologize.

314
00:19:13,518 --> 00:19:15,854
A queen should never cry
in front of others.

315
00:19:15,937 --> 00:19:19,858
[NOELLE] Oh, come on!
That's not true at all.

316
00:19:19,941 --> 00:19:21,359
[gasps]

317
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:27,490
It's okay for you to cry.
Especially with friends.

318
00:19:27,574 --> 00:19:29,034
Exactly.

319
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:37,042
Thank you, Noelle. Mimosa.

320
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:39,753
--[LOROPECHIKA yelps]

321
00:19:39,836 --> 00:19:42,505
[NOELLE] How did you trip with
both of us holding you?

322
00:19:42,589 --> 00:19:44,299
[MIMOSA laughs]

323
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:50,847
[MIMOSA] No matter what,
we're going to win this fight!

324
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:52,807
[MIMOSA]
For Loropechika!

325
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:54,851
[NOELLE]
For our precious friend!

326
00:19:54,934 --> 00:19:57,312
We're at 65 percent!

327
00:19:57,395 --> 00:19:58,813
Sixty-six percent!

328
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:00,732
Sixty-seven percent!

329
00:20:00,815 --> 00:20:03,860
[laughs] Are you ready
for the big one?

330
00:20:03,943 --> 00:20:06,154
Here we go!

331
00:20:06,237 --> 00:20:09,991
You get my best! Lucky you!

332
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:13,661
Here's 70-percent power!

333
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:15,330
Do it, Noelle!

334
00:20:16,998 --> 00:20:19,626
We were waiting for this!

335
00:20:19,709 --> 00:20:21,711
We need Vanica to use
the highest percentage

336
00:20:21,795 --> 00:20:23,755
of devil power that
she can muster.

337
00:20:23,838 --> 00:20:26,675
As her Blood Magic ramps up,
she'll lose more and more blood

338
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:28,385
and deplete her mana.

339
00:20:28,468 --> 00:20:29,594
That's when she'll start drawing

340
00:20:29,678 --> 00:20:32,263
on Megicula's power
to keep on fighting.

341
00:20:32,347 --> 00:20:36,309
After that, we should be able
to go head-to-head with her.

342
00:20:36,393 --> 00:20:38,228
And when she runs
out of that, as well,

343
00:20:38,311 --> 00:20:41,147
it'll be time to use
our ace in the hole.

344
00:20:41,231 --> 00:20:44,275
That's you, our
arcane-stage fighter.

345
00:20:45,276 --> 00:20:47,278
Nero!

346
00:20:54,327 --> 00:20:56,830
[LOROPECHIKA]
With Nero's arcane-stage spells,

347
00:20:56,913 --> 00:21:00,417
and your combative spirit
and fighting style,

348
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,627
if we train hard and
create a formidable team,

349
00:21:02,711 --> 00:21:04,838
I'm confident with our
abilities combined,

350
00:21:04,921 --> 00:21:07,257
we can overpower
Vanica and Megicula

351
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,926
when the time finally
comes to battle with them!

352
00:21:12,262 --> 00:21:15,223
Well, Nero, can we
count you in, too?

353
00:21:16,516 --> 00:21:18,560
I'm about to seal away
that devil's power

354
00:21:18,643 --> 00:21:21,187
you seem so proud of!

355
00:21:21,271 --> 00:21:25,608
[SECRÉ] Mana Method.
Sealing Magic: Eternal Prison!

356
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,283
[SECRÉ] I won't let Queen
Loropechika, or this world,

357
00:21:33,366 --> 00:21:35,744
be harmed by scum like you!

358
00:23:07,961 --> 00:23:10,046
[FULL CAST]
Clover Clips!

359
00:23:11,965 --> 00:23:14,926
[LOROPECHIKA] What the Queen of
the Heart Kingdom Inherited.

360
00:23:16,594 --> 00:23:18,346
[NARRATOR] The Queen of
the Heart Kingdom inherits

361
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:20,390
the previous queens' powers,

362
00:23:20,473 --> 00:23:23,601
as well as their
knowledge and experiences.

363
00:23:23,685 --> 00:23:26,479
Here, inside
Loropechika's mind,

364
00:23:26,563 --> 00:23:29,983
is where that colossal mountain
of information materializes.

365
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:34,654
[sighs] This isn't
the right one.

366
00:23:34,738 --> 00:23:37,115
Not in here.

367
00:23:37,198 --> 00:23:39,075
Nope, no good.

368
00:23:39,159 --> 00:23:40,160
No.

369
00:23:40,243 --> 00:23:41,036
No.

370
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:42,787
Agh, darn it!

371
00:23:42,871 --> 00:23:45,665
Why were the previous queens
so disorganized, huh?

372
00:23:45,749 --> 00:23:50,628
They could've at least
put things in ABC order!

373
00:23:50,712 --> 00:23:52,172
You're no better.

374
00:23:56,843 --> 00:23:58,720
[NOELLE]
No matter how strong the enemy

375
00:23:58,803 --> 00:24:02,265
or how dire the situation,
we will never give up!

376
00:24:02,349 --> 00:24:04,309
We'll keep pushing
past our limits.

377
00:24:04,392 --> 00:24:06,102
That's what the Black Bulls do!
