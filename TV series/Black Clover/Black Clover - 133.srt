00:00:22,554 --> 00:00:24,139
[NARRATOR]
The Clover Kingdom.

2
00:00:24,222 --> 00:00:26,641
In this place where
magic is everything,

3
00:00:26,725 --> 00:00:29,602
there lives one boy
who was born without it.

4
00:00:29,686 --> 00:00:31,938
His name is Asta.

5
00:00:33,398 --> 00:00:34,816
[NARRATOR]
His strength and determination

6
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:37,152
helped him become
a Magic Knight.

7
00:00:37,235 --> 00:00:39,779
And despite the many
challenges he faces,

8
00:00:39,863 --> 00:00:43,575
he aims for the top
and refuses to give up!

9
00:00:43,658 --> 00:00:45,326
Rich or poor,

10
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:47,412
royalty or commoner,

11
00:00:47,495 --> 00:00:50,290
Asta believes anyone can shine.

12
00:00:50,373 --> 00:00:53,376
His mission is to prove
that to the whole world

13
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,379
and to become the
next Wizard King!

14
00:00:57,464 --> 00:00:58,423
[NARRATOR]
After barging into

15
00:00:58,506 --> 00:01:00,884
the Black Bulls'
hideout unannounced,

16
00:01:00,967 --> 00:01:04,929
Mereoleona marched out with
Asta and company in tow.

17
00:01:05,013 --> 00:01:08,058
Their destination:
the Yultim Volcano.

18
00:01:08,141 --> 00:01:10,268
A strong magic region
where Asta and Noelle

19
00:01:10,352 --> 00:01:14,147
had previously trained with
the Crimson Lion Kings.

20
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:16,441
There, Mereoleona
and Fuegoleon had arranged

21
00:01:16,524 --> 00:01:18,985
another training session
in preparation for

22
00:01:19,069 --> 00:01:20,904
their battle with the devil.

23
00:01:20,987 --> 00:01:23,948
Let's race to the top so we
can hit that sweet hot spring!

24
00:01:24,032 --> 00:01:25,658
--Hold it.
--[ASTA yells]

25
00:01:25,742 --> 00:01:28,036
There'll be
no climbing this time.

26
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:31,039
Instead, I'm going to
have you venture below.

27
00:01:31,122 --> 00:01:33,416
To the Underground Cave!

28
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,502
[NARRATOR] As the young wizards
approached the hot springs

29
00:01:35,585 --> 00:01:37,253
that marked the end
of their path,

30
00:01:37,337 --> 00:01:38,713
they encountered a new mana,

31
00:01:38,797 --> 00:01:41,591
blazing with an intensity
they had never seen before.

32
00:01:41,675 --> 00:01:42,967
But then...

33
00:01:43,051 --> 00:01:44,427
[NOELLE screams]

34
00:01:44,511 --> 00:01:45,553
[ASTA, LEOPOLD gasp]

35
00:01:50,642 --> 00:01:51,851
Eat this!

36
00:01:51,935 --> 00:01:54,896
Flame Magic: Spiral Flames!

37
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:57,440
[NARRATOR] A powerful spell from
Leopold was enough to ward off

38
00:01:57,524 --> 00:02:00,151
the monstrous spider,
and soon after,

39
00:02:00,235 --> 00:02:02,570
another of the cave's
secrets was revealed.

40
00:02:04,489 --> 00:02:06,324
Where does that door lead to?

41
00:02:06,408 --> 00:02:09,744
Ah, a dungeon.
This oughta be interesting.

42
00:03:46,633 --> 00:03:49,094
[footsteps]

43
00:03:55,809 --> 00:03:58,311
Captain Mereoleona,
what's happening here?

44
00:03:58,395 --> 00:03:59,813
[MEREOLEONA]
You're late!

45
00:03:59,896 --> 00:04:01,731
You weren't called out here
for a leisurely stroll with

46
00:04:01,815 --> 00:04:04,401
your Black Bull buddies,
you weaklings!

47
00:04:04,484 --> 00:04:07,696
You call yourselves
Crimson Lion Kings?

48
00:04:07,779 --> 00:04:09,864
We beg your forgiveness.

49
00:04:09,948 --> 00:04:11,491
[BEN] We would've gotten
here faster if it had been

50
00:04:11,574 --> 00:04:13,785
just the Vice Captain and me.

51
00:04:13,868 --> 00:04:16,037
[FORTI]
We are unworthy of our station.

52
00:04:16,121 --> 00:04:17,288
[MEREOLEONA]
And you...

53
00:04:17,372 --> 00:04:20,166
Nobody gave you
permission to eat!

54
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,085
Oh, come on, Charmy,
read the room, would ya?

55
00:04:22,168 --> 00:04:24,212
This really isn't
the time for a snack!

56
00:04:24,295 --> 00:04:26,006
We've already
reported our discovery

57
00:04:26,089 --> 00:04:27,674
to the royal capital.

58
00:04:27,757 --> 00:04:29,926
You are to wait here
for instructions.

59
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,428
[CRIMSON LIONS]
Yes, sir!

60
00:04:35,932 --> 00:04:36,933
What?

61
00:04:37,017 --> 00:04:38,727
Hold on, are you
saying that giant spider

62
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:39,978
came after you guys, too?

63
00:04:40,061 --> 00:04:40,979
[LUCK, MAGNA, GORDON]
Mm-hm.

64
00:04:41,062 --> 00:04:42,313
Yeah, and just like that,

65
00:04:42,397 --> 00:04:44,482
the thing bugged off into
some mystery dungeon.

66
00:04:44,566 --> 00:04:45,859
Right? I'm so ready!

67
00:04:45,942 --> 00:04:47,485
Ready for what?

68
00:04:48,486 --> 00:04:51,072
[LEOPOLD] I was a fool
to let that spider escape.

69
00:04:51,156 --> 00:04:52,991
This can't be how it ends!

70
00:04:54,784 --> 00:04:55,744
[LEOPOLD]
Sister!

71
00:04:55,827 --> 00:04:57,078
[MEREOLEONA]
Hm?

72
00:04:57,162 --> 00:04:59,039
[LEOPOLD] We wish to explore
the dungeon as well!

73
00:05:00,165 --> 00:05:01,791
[MEREOLEONA]
Don't get cocky!

74
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:04,169
You're the incompetent weakling
who let that bug get away

75
00:05:04,252 --> 00:05:05,879
to begin with, fool.

76
00:05:05,962 --> 00:05:09,132
You've got some nerve asking
anything of me after that!

77
00:05:09,215 --> 00:05:11,551
But next time,
I know I can defeat it!

78
00:05:11,634 --> 00:05:14,262
There is no
"next time" in battle!

79
00:05:16,598 --> 00:05:17,974
[gasping]

80
00:05:18,058 --> 00:05:21,102
Now get your head on straight
by fighting your way

81
00:05:21,186 --> 00:05:22,645
through that dungeon!

82
00:05:22,729 --> 00:05:23,938
Yes, ma'am!

83
00:05:24,022 --> 00:05:26,399
[ASTA] Man, she's still
as hot-blooded as ever!

84
00:05:26,483 --> 00:05:28,943
[NOELLE] Wasn't that exactly
what he was asking for?

85
00:05:29,027 --> 00:05:30,904
[FUEGOLEON]
All eyes up here!

86
00:05:30,987 --> 00:05:34,491
All right, then,
Captain Fuegoleon filled me in.

87
00:05:34,574 --> 00:05:36,576
Deep in that dungeon
you discovered,

88
00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:39,287
we believe there's
a powerful magic item.

89
00:05:39,371 --> 00:05:41,414
[ALL gasp]

90
00:05:41,498 --> 00:05:42,999
[MARX] According to
a book that Master Julius

91
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:46,294
found in the library, it was
sealed away somewhere inside

92
00:05:46,378 --> 00:05:48,797
the Yultim Volcano
centuries ago

93
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,509
out of fear that its power might
someday be used for evil.

94
00:05:52,592 --> 00:05:54,969
Unfortunately, the records
contain nothing specific

95
00:05:55,053 --> 00:05:57,097
about the item itself.

96
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,848
[JULIUS] That's right--
it's a total mystery!

97
00:05:58,932 --> 00:06:00,767
I don't need help explaining.

98
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,227
Now please be quiet!

99
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,353
Sorry to interrupt.

100
00:06:03,436 --> 00:06:04,562
I'm just so excited
to learn about

101
00:06:04,646 --> 00:06:06,731
this long-lost
mystery artifact!

102
00:06:06,815 --> 00:06:07,899
[MARX growls]

103
00:06:07,982 --> 00:06:09,776
[JULIUS]
Actually, can I go there, too?

104
00:06:09,859 --> 00:06:11,111
[MARX]
Absolutely not!

105
00:06:11,194 --> 00:06:12,946
[JULIUS]
Why? I'll wear a disguise!

106
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:15,240
[MARX] That's entirely
beside the point!

107
00:06:15,323 --> 00:06:16,825
Who do you think
he's talking to?

108
00:06:16,908 --> 00:06:17,826
Not sure.

109
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:19,077
[ASTA]
I know that voice.

110
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,578
[NOELLE]
The Wizard King.

111
00:06:20,662 --> 00:06:22,038
[MARX]
In any case,

112
00:06:22,122 --> 00:06:24,624
this magic item will be key
in restoring our kingdom,

113
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:26,209
along with any other
treasure you might find

114
00:06:26,292 --> 00:06:28,086
inside the dungeon.

115
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:31,047
I ask that you all conduct
your search thoroughly.

116
00:06:31,131 --> 00:06:32,382
Understood.

117
00:06:32,465 --> 00:06:33,508
Now, then!

118
00:06:33,591 --> 00:06:35,218
[MEREOLEONA]
Listen here, fools!

119
00:06:35,301 --> 00:06:38,304
You're all staking your pride
as magic knights on this.

120
00:06:38,388 --> 00:06:40,015
Do it for your kingdom!

121
00:06:40,098 --> 00:06:41,474
[CRIMSON LIONS]
Yes, ma'am!

122
00:06:41,558 --> 00:06:43,560
Please, Sister,
as the current Captain,

123
00:06:43,643 --> 00:06:46,229
I should be the one
to conclude this briefing.

124
00:06:46,312 --> 00:06:49,024
Fine. Hurry up
and get on with it.

125
00:06:49,107 --> 00:06:50,775
A-hem.

126
00:06:50,859 --> 00:06:55,447
Asta, Noelle, Leo,
Randall, Luck, and Magna.

127
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:58,992
You are to take the lead
and locate the magic item.

128
00:06:59,075 --> 00:07:00,910
The rest of you will
rendezvous with these six

129
00:07:00,994 --> 00:07:03,288
as soon as your
mana has recovered.

130
00:07:03,371 --> 00:07:05,665
[JULIUS] I'm just gonna
head down there real quick.

131
00:07:05,749 --> 00:07:07,584
[MARX]
You will do no such thing.

132
00:07:07,667 --> 00:07:09,502
I'm ready. Let's do this!

133
00:07:09,586 --> 00:07:10,879
[CRIMSON LIONS]
Yeah!

134
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,308
[ASTA]
Ouch.

135
00:07:32,525 --> 00:07:34,027
Damn, I thought
it was hot before,

136
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:36,154
but that was nothing
compared to this.

137
00:07:36,237 --> 00:07:38,782
I don't sense that
spider's mana at all.

138
00:07:38,865 --> 00:07:39,949
Uh-oh.

139
00:07:45,955 --> 00:07:47,374
[yells]

140
00:07:47,457 --> 00:07:48,750
Skillfully done, rival!

141
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,877
You've disarmed the
first trap already!

142
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,713
[ASTA] It's not like
I did that on purpose!

143
00:07:53,797 --> 00:07:56,383
[LEOPOLD gasps, screams]

144
00:07:56,466 --> 00:07:59,177
[RANDALL] We can't afford to get
bogged down here for too long.

145
00:08:08,395 --> 00:08:09,646
[gasping]

146
00:08:09,729 --> 00:08:11,231
[NOELLE] He used just enough
power to reveal them

147
00:08:11,314 --> 00:08:12,732
without triggering them.

148
00:08:12,816 --> 00:08:16,486
That was high-level magic,
and he made it look easy!

149
00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:17,696
[ASTA]
So that's the Vice Captain

150
00:08:17,779 --> 00:08:19,489
of the Crimson Lion Kings!

151
00:08:19,572 --> 00:08:20,865
[MAGNA] Now that they're
all lit up like this,

152
00:08:20,949 --> 00:08:23,159
we could spot these traps
with our eyes shut!

153
00:08:23,243 --> 00:08:25,120
Later, you guys!

Don't set 'em off
in front of me!

Well, Asta, it looks
like the middle path's

160
00:08:44,347 --> 00:08:46,141
been claimed,
so let's split up here.

161
00:08:46,224 --> 00:08:48,935
Whichever team finds the magic
item first wins the race!

162
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:50,562
All right, you're on!

163
00:08:52,605 --> 00:08:55,025
[ASTA, NOELLE panting]

164
00:08:55,108 --> 00:08:57,861
[LEOPOLD, RANDALL panting]

165
00:08:59,529 --> 00:09:01,322
[RANDALL] I'm amazed
Leo can move so easily

166
00:09:01,406 --> 00:09:03,908
in mana this dense.

167
00:09:03,992 --> 00:09:06,661
[LEOPOLD] We need to be quick,
Vice Captain Randall!

168
00:09:06,745 --> 00:09:08,163
Got it.

169
00:09:08,246 --> 00:09:10,331
I have to say, Leo, it's obvious
that you've been training

170
00:09:10,415 --> 00:09:12,792
far harder than anyone
else in the squad.

171
00:09:12,876 --> 00:09:14,794
And yet, I'm still
not strong enough to catch up

172
00:09:14,878 --> 00:09:17,505
with my rival, let
alone surpass him!

173
00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:19,007
[RANDALL]
Hm?

174
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:20,467
[LEOPOLD]
In his recent battle,

175
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:23,970
Asta went toe to toe
with a devil and won.

176
00:09:24,054 --> 00:09:26,306
What's more, I heard that
the other Black Bulls

177
00:09:26,389 --> 00:09:28,600
also fought valiantly.

178
00:09:28,683 --> 00:09:30,810
This training
can hardly compare.

179
00:09:30,894 --> 00:09:32,437
[RANDALL]
So that's it.

180
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,148
Now I see why the captains
invited the Black Bulls

181
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:38,526
to take part in this
exercise with us.

182

[RANDALL]
Don't sell yourself short, Leo.

183
00:09:40,278 --> 00:09:42,072
I think that last battle
brought you to the verge

184
00:09:42,155 --> 00:09:44,032
of a breakthrough.

185
00:09:44,115 --> 00:09:45,950
It hit you when you
had to face off with me

186
00:09:46,034 --> 00:09:48,495
after that elf
took over my body.

187
00:09:52,415 --> 00:09:54,042
I'm sure I could
sense violent intent

188
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:56,836
in that surge of mana just now.

189
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,421
Let's check it out.

Come on.

193
00:10:16,606 --> 00:10:17,816
It's only gonna get worse
if we can't smash

194
00:10:17,899 --> 00:10:19,442
our way through this!

195

Charging through
a dungeon full of traps

196
00:10:21,027 --> 00:10:22,862
might be fine for
a meathead like you,

197
00:10:22,946 --> 00:10:25,407
but that's not how
I do things, okay?

198
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,033
[ASTA]
Then just let me carry you!

199

Huh?

200
00:10:28,326 --> 00:10:30,245
You can hop on my back
and keep casting spells

while I get us outta here!

202
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,832
You want me to hop on your back?

203

I refuse, I'm royalty and
that's beneath my dignity!

00:10:48,847 --> 00:10:51,307
[ASTA whimpers]
We're pulling back for now!

210
00:11:02,193 --> 00:11:03,319
Is this...?

211
00:11:03,403 --> 00:11:04,487
Look up.

212
00:11:05,864 --> 00:11:07,032
[LEOPOLD] Those must be
the golems that were

guarding this place.

Stay sharp.

215
00:11:10,535 --> 00:11:12,078
The spider may have sent out
that blast of violent mana

216
00:11:12,162 --> 00:11:14,831
before because it
wanted us to find it.

217
00:11:14,914 --> 00:11:17,751
It might be trying
to draw us into a trap.

218

You won't escape
from me this time, bug!

to recover your mana,

No. Thanks to Asta,

00:16:57,257 --> 00:16:59,968
[SECRÉ] This must be
the spider's original form.

321
00:17:00,051 --> 00:17:02,846
It seems this magic item
causes its user's life force

322
00:17:02,929 --> 00:17:04,347
to grow out of control.

323
00:17:04,431 --> 00:17:06,683
And in the process,
the power overload turns them

324
00:17:06,766 --> 00:17:08,226
into a monster.

325
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:17,235
[FUEGOLEON] Excellent work
in finding the treasure room.

326
00:17:17,318 --> 00:17:19,404
The trial you've endured
here today will surely leave

327
00:17:19,487 --> 00:17:21,531
all of you better prepared
for your coming battle

328
00:17:21,614 --> 00:17:22,615
with the devil.

329
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:23,700
[CRIMSON LIONS]
Yes, sir!

330
00:17:23,783 --> 00:17:25,452
It took a while,
but I think I'm startin'

331
00:17:25,535 --> 00:17:27,912
to get the hang of
this Mana Skin thing!

332
00:17:27,996 --> 00:17:30,915
And I can tell my spells
are getting more powerful.

333
00:17:30,999 --> 00:17:32,167
[ASTA]
Speaking of...

334
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,044
Did everyone else see
that crazy-strong spell

335
00:17:34,127 --> 00:17:36,296
Leo whipped out
right at the end?

336
00:17:36,379 --> 00:17:37,422
[LEOPOLD]
It happened so fast.

337
00:17:37,505 --> 00:17:39,424
I barely know what I did.

338
00:17:39,507 --> 00:17:43,553
What was that spell,
and how do I control it?

339
00:17:43,636 --> 00:17:46,848
[LEOPOLD laughs]
Yes, rival, be amazed!

340
00:17:46,931 --> 00:17:50,435
Soon, I shall master that spell
and become stronger than you!

341
00:17:50,518 --> 00:17:53,063
Then I'll just have
to get stronger than you!

342
00:17:53,146 --> 00:17:55,690
Then I'll be forced
to become stronger still!

343
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:58,276
I'll get even stronger-er, then!

344
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,612
Then I'll simply have
to keep on getting stronger!

345
00:18:00,695 --> 00:18:03,782
[BOTH shouting]

346
00:18:03,865 --> 00:18:05,033
Stop your shouting!

347
00:18:05,116 --> 00:18:06,576
[LEOPOLD, ASTA]
Yes, ma'am!

348
00:18:06,659 --> 00:18:08,661
This mission isn't over yet.

349
00:18:08,745 --> 00:18:10,955
Not until the magic
item is secured.

350
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,750
Right, here you go.

351
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:15,418
[MEREOLEONA]
What is this?

352
00:18:15,502 --> 00:18:17,420
[ASTA] What do you mean?
It's the magic item!

353
00:18:17,504 --> 00:18:20,715
It's a damn lump of coal,
you absolute fools!

354
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:23,426
[MEREOLEONA]
Bringing back that magic item

355
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,679
was our primary objective
on this mission.

356
00:18:25,762 --> 00:18:28,431
How could you idiots
burn it to ash like this?

357
00:18:28,515 --> 00:18:29,516
You're right.

358
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:31,351
We beg for your forgiveness.

359
00:18:31,434 --> 00:18:33,770
[MEREOLEONA] You're going back
in and searching that dungeon

360
00:18:33,853 --> 00:18:34,854
from end to end,

361
00:18:34,938 --> 00:18:37,399
and you will not
return empty-handed!

362
00:18:37,482 --> 00:18:38,858
[BOTH]
Yes, ma'am!

363
00:18:38,942 --> 00:18:40,360
[ASTA]
Wait, really?

364
00:18:40,443 --> 00:18:42,028
Come on, you can't be serious!

365
00:18:42,112 --> 00:18:43,238
[NOELLE]
She's serious.

366
00:18:43,321 --> 00:18:44,614
[BEN]
Dead serious.

367
00:18:44,698 --> 00:18:46,574
[RANDALL]
She's totally serious.

368
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:49,327
[MEREOLEONA] Everybody else,
get to the hot springs!

369
00:18:49,411 --> 00:18:50,620
[CRIMSON LIONS]
Yes, ma'am!

370
00:18:53,456 --> 00:18:54,666
[SECRÉ sighs]

371
00:18:54,749 --> 00:18:56,543
[CHARMY]
Drink up.

372
00:18:56,626 --> 00:18:58,586
Well, I'm still not sure what
all those ingredients are

373
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,630
that I found in the dungeon,
so I just squeezed anything

374
00:19:00,714 --> 00:19:02,007
that looked like it
might have juice in it

375
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:04,175
and mixed it all up into
this one super-special,

376
00:19:04,259 --> 00:19:06,177
thirst-quenching dungeon drink!

377
00:19:06,261 --> 00:19:08,138
[SECRÉ groans]

378
00:19:08,221 --> 00:19:09,723
[NOELLE sighs]

379
00:19:09,806 --> 00:19:12,350
I have to admit,
this bath is nice.

380
00:19:12,434 --> 00:19:14,477
It looks like you've been
getting a bit closer.

381
00:19:14,561 --> 00:19:15,478
Huh?

382
00:19:15,562 --> 00:19:16,604
To your mother.

383
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:18,023
[gasps]

384
00:19:18,106 --> 00:19:20,191
[MEREOLEONA] That form you
used in your last battle.

385
00:19:20,275 --> 00:19:23,194
You were the living image of
the Steel Warrior Princess,

386
00:19:23,278 --> 00:19:24,863
Lady Acier.

387
00:19:24,946 --> 00:19:27,073
You've still got
a ways to go yet.

388
00:19:27,157 --> 00:19:30,452
Right now, your magic's
not nearly as strong.

389
00:19:30,535 --> 00:19:31,536
Yeah.

390
00:19:31,619 --> 00:19:33,705
Of course.

391
00:19:33,788 --> 00:19:36,332
[DOROTHY] The truth is exactly
what you suspected.

392
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:39,753
Acier Silva lost her life
to a devil's curse.

393
00:19:39,836 --> 00:19:41,296
And what's worse,
anyone who speaks

394
00:19:41,379 --> 00:19:43,882
of Acier's fate will
share it with her.

395
00:19:43,965 --> 00:19:46,343
That's the cruel nature of the
curse that befell your mother,

396
00:19:46,426 --> 00:19:50,096
and within the real world,
there's no way around it.

397
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,598
But that just means...

398
00:19:51,681 --> 00:19:53,350
...I have to get stronger.

399
00:19:53,433 --> 00:19:56,102
Backing down is not an option.

400
00:19:56,186 --> 00:19:57,771
Is that right?

401
00:19:57,854 --> 00:19:59,773
So, um... While we're here,

402
00:19:59,856 --> 00:20:03,109
could you tell me a little
bit more about my mother?

403
00:20:03,193 --> 00:20:04,486
[MEREOLEONA]
That could take a while.

404
00:20:04,569 --> 00:20:06,613
[NOELLE]
Ah. That's fine!

405
00:20:06,696 --> 00:20:08,656
Isn't this great?

406
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:11,618
Man, the Crimson Lion Kings'
captain is crazy uptight.

407
00:20:11,701 --> 00:20:14,746
He's like some freaky opposite
version of Captain Yami.

408
00:20:14,829 --> 00:20:16,331
[FUEGOLEON]
Listen well.

409
00:20:16,414 --> 00:20:19,167
These hot springs are more than
a spot for an invigorating soak!

410
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,502
[CRIMSON LIONS]
Yes, sir!

411
00:20:20,585 --> 00:20:22,545
[FUEGOLEON] If the heat
becomes too much to bear,

412
00:20:22,629 --> 00:20:24,881
you must keep your composure
and quench your body and soul

413
00:20:24,964 --> 00:20:27,050
in cold water,
then return to the bath

414
00:20:27,133 --> 00:20:29,636
and push to your
limits once more.

415
00:20:29,719 --> 00:20:30,804
Even as we relax,

416
00:20:30,887 --> 00:20:32,847
we must strive to
overcome our weakness!

417
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:34,057
[CRIMSON LIONS]
Yes, sir!

418
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,558
Furthermore, remember
to cleanse your body

419
00:20:35,642 --> 00:20:37,894
before entering the bath,
and don't let your towels

420
00:20:37,977 --> 00:20:40,313
come in contact with the water.

421
00:20:40,397 --> 00:20:42,440
Make sure to rinse off
the shower and...

422
00:20:42,524 --> 00:20:44,859
[BEN]
My body and soul need a quench.

423
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:47,570
[FORTI] How long can the
captain keep talking like this?

424
00:20:47,654 --> 00:20:49,656
Have Asta and Leopold returned?

425
00:20:49,739 --> 00:20:51,741
I hope they get a chance
to strengthen their bonds

426
00:20:51,825 --> 00:20:54,828
by washing each other's
backs in the hot spring.

427
00:20:56,663 --> 00:20:58,164
[ASTA] Yeah, we kept
looking till morning,

428
00:20:58,248 --> 00:21:01,001
and we still didn't find
anything worth bringing with us.

429
00:21:01,084 --> 00:21:03,044
Anyway, that's my day.
How were the springs?

430
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:05,171
Sweat the exhaustion
straight outta me.

431
00:21:05,255 --> 00:21:07,215
With all the collagen
in those ingredients I found,

432
00:21:07,298 --> 00:21:09,801
my skin feels smooth as silk!

433
00:21:09,884 --> 00:21:11,386
[NOELLE]
She's not wrong.

434
00:21:11,469 --> 00:21:14,514
If it weren't in a strong magic
region, I'd come here every day.

435
00:21:14,597 --> 00:21:16,224
Your skin looks
really smooth, too!

436
00:21:16,307 --> 00:21:17,934
Hey, back off!

437
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,270
[LUCK]
That was a lot of fun!

438
00:21:20,353 --> 00:21:22,981
I hope we can train
with them again soon!

439
00:21:23,064 --> 00:21:25,275
Are you crazy? That psycho
kidnapped us and dragged us

440
00:21:25,358 --> 00:21:26,526
to a freaking volcano.

441
00:21:26,609 --> 00:21:28,903
If I never see her again,
it'll be too soon.

442
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:30,780
[LUCK] It'd be so funny
if she was in there.

443
00:21:30,864 --> 00:21:32,198
Come on, there's no way.

Where's the magic item?

00:23:21,224 --> 00:23:23,351
And what's with all these
weird treasure chests?

00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:25,854
Envy me, rival, for I
have discovered a treasure

the likes of which our
world has never seen!

Oh, man!

Those are pretty impressive,
but take a look at this pair!

Now those're some big,
beefy man legs!

So buff!

They make me wanna
bust out a set of squats!

460

It seems we have
no choice but to find out

which of us can locate
the greatest treasure chest

00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,963
their mission entirely,

Asta and Leopold continued
goofing off through the night.

468
00:23:56,676 --> 00:23:58,053
[FUEGOLEON]
It is a day of great consequence

469
00:23:58,136 --> 00:23:59,387
to the House of Vermillion.

00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:01,556
We straddle the line
between life and death.

For today, we receive her!
