The Clover Kingdom.

00:00:24,264 --> 00:00:26,641
In this place where
magic is everything,

3
00:00:26,725 --> 00:00:29,561
there lives one boy
who was born without it.

4
00:00:29,644 --> 00:00:31,938
His name is Asta.

5
00:00:33,106 --> 00:00:34,524
[NARRATOR]
His strength and determination

6
00:00:34,607 --> 00:00:36,860
helped him become
a Magic Knight.

7
00:00:36,943 --> 00:00:39,571
And despite the many
challenges he faces,

8
00:00:39,654 --> 00:00:43,324
he aims for the top
and refuses to give up!

00:00:43,408 --> 00:00:45,035
Rich or poor,

10

royalty or commoner,

11
00:00:47,245 --> 00:00:49,998
Asta believes anyone can shine.

12
00:00:50,081 --> 00:00:53,126
His mission is to prove
that to the whole world,

13
00:00:53,209 --> 00:00:55,962
and to become the
next Wizard King!

[NARRATOR]
The Magic Knights:

15
00:02:32,976 --> 00:02:36,646
nine squads of capable mages
who specialize in combat spells,

16
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:39,315
in direct service
to the Wizard King.

17
00:02:39,399 --> 00:02:41,026
These heroes
dedicate their lives

18
00:02:41,109 --> 00:02:43,111
to protecting the kingdom.

19
00:02:43,194 --> 00:02:45,655
It is said that a Magic Knights
Squad Captain possesses

20
00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:50,660
the strength and prowess
of 100 mages combined.

21
00:02:50,744 --> 00:02:52,704
Along with the Wizard King,

22
00:02:52,787 --> 00:02:57,375
the captains are revered
as great role models.

23
00:02:57,459 --> 00:02:59,794
Recently, these titans
went head-to-head

24
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:02,756
in a mock tournament
organized by Sir Julius,

25
00:03:02,839 --> 00:03:04,466
who sought to bolster
the fighting spirit

of the Magic Knights Squads
before their next major battle.

Let's end this fight. Now!

00:03:47,217 --> 00:03:49,844
I don't take orders
from snobs like you!

it'll burn to ash

and as Captain

I refuse to be defeated
in such a pathetic manner!

I'm sure you're watching,
Crimson Lion Kings!

[NARRATOR] For months, each of
the nine Magic Knights Squads

68
00:05:15,305 --> 00:05:17,390
worked hard to
hone their skills,

00:05:17,474 --> 00:05:22,645
so they'd be ready to face
this fearsome new enemy.

70
00:05:22,729 --> 00:05:24,898
Asta and Noelle were
especially inspired

by the captains' tournament and
strove to increase their power,

meeting with the Heart Kingdom's

So you're here, too.

Uh. Yeah, it was that dummy--

Er, I mean Asta's idea.

133
00:08:48,768 --> 00:08:51,521
Before we fight Spade,
he thought that it might help

134
00:08:51,604 --> 00:08:53,231
if we could revisit
our roots and look back

135

on how we both
became Magic Knights.

Don't play dumb with me.

141
00:09:13,543 --> 00:09:15,670
I've told you royalty
need not undergo

142
00:09:15,754 --> 00:09:18,006
the same tests as common folk.

Stop this pointless nonsense.

Yes. Of course, Nozel.

147
00:09:27,265 --> 00:09:29,184
[NOZEL]
Although, if we're being honest,

148
00:09:29,267 --> 00:09:31,770
your very existence
is pointless.

149
00:09:36,274 --> 00:09:38,193
[NOELLE]
I get it now, though.

150
00:09:38,276 --> 00:09:40,904
My brother did all that
out of kindness,

151
00:09:40,987 --> 00:09:45,200
because he didn't want me
to have to go into battle.

What's wrong?

[NOELLE]
Uh, nothing!

154
00:09:47,911 --> 00:09:51,373
It's just, a year ago,
when I got my squad assignment,

155
00:09:51,456 --> 00:09:55,919
I couldn't help but wonder why
I ended up in the Black Bulls.

156
00:09:56,002 --> 00:09:57,337
But later,

157
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,256
I realized that it was
actually a perfect fit for me.

158
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,676
So now I'm grateful to you.

159
00:10:04,552 --> 00:10:08,139
The people I work with...
They're like my family.

I've shared
experiences with them

161
00:10:09,933 --> 00:10:12,727
that I wouldn't
trade for anything.

162
00:10:12,811 --> 00:10:15,480
You've grown, Noelle.
I'm proud.

163
00:10:15,563 --> 00:10:17,190
Thank you so much!

164
00:10:20,443 --> 00:10:23,822
[NOZEL] I know you have the
potential to grow even more,

165
00:10:23,905 --> 00:10:25,865
and to become a better mage.

166
00:10:27,575 --> 00:10:30,704
[NOZEL]
Yes, just like our mother.

167
00:10:30,787 --> 00:10:32,997
I told you guys to buzz
off--everybody knows

168
00:10:33,081 --> 00:10:35,750
I don't have magic,
so let's move on, already!

169
00:11:18,335 --> 00:11:20,253
The Magic Knight
Captains are here!

170
00:11:20,337 --> 00:11:23,214
They're kinda overwhelming, huh?

171
00:11:35,226 --> 00:11:37,604
[WILLIAM] I am the captain
of the Golden Dawn.

172
00:11:37,687 --> 00:11:39,856
William Vangeance.

173
00:11:39,939 --> 00:11:43,610
I'll be conducting the Magic
Knights Entrance Exam today.

174
00:11:44,944 --> 00:11:46,029
[WILLIAM]
First of all,

175
00:11:46,112 --> 00:11:48,740
I'd like to commend you
for participating.

176
00:11:48,823 --> 00:11:51,951
After the havoc caused by
the Eye of the Midnight Sun,

177
00:11:52,035 --> 00:11:56,998
the Clover Kingdom needs
its mages more than ever.

178
00:11:57,082 --> 00:12:00,293
[BOY 152A] That's Lord
Vangeance, the famous hero.

179
00:12:00,377 --> 00:12:02,879
[GIRL 152A]
He's praising us.

180
00:12:02,962 --> 00:12:06,007
And, of course,
you must know this:

181
00:12:06,091 --> 00:12:09,886
even if you fail today,
your journey isn't over.

182
00:12:09,969 --> 00:12:12,764
Anyone is free
to retake the exam

183
00:12:12,847 --> 00:12:15,225
as many times as they desire.

184
00:12:17,143 --> 00:12:18,770
With that said...

185
00:12:18,853 --> 00:12:21,064
Magic Tree Descend!

186
00:12:46,798 --> 00:12:50,135
The Magic Knights Entrance Exam
will now commence!

187
00:12:55,932 --> 00:13:02,605
[PARTICIPANTS
chattering, yelping]

188
00:13:02,689 --> 00:13:05,358
Man! This sure takes me back!

189
00:13:05,442 --> 00:13:06,693
Yeah, same here.

190
00:13:06,776 --> 00:13:09,070
You couldn't even get off
the ground, remember?

191
00:13:10,071 --> 00:13:11,865
[ASTA]
Huh? You were watching me?

192
00:13:11,948 --> 00:13:14,034
[NOELLE] Well, it was
kind of hard not to.

193
00:13:14,117 --> 00:13:16,911
You stuck out like a sore thumb.

194
00:13:16,995 --> 00:13:19,831
Not only that, but you
had no magic power.

195
00:13:19,914 --> 00:13:23,043
I thought for sure
you'd fail spectacularly.

196
00:13:25,295 --> 00:13:27,130
[NOELLE]
But, to everyone's surprise...

197
00:13:27,213 --> 00:13:30,383
[laughing]

198
00:13:30,467 --> 00:13:33,136
You know, kid, I like you.

199
00:13:33,219 --> 00:13:35,889
Come join our crew.

200
00:13:35,972 --> 00:13:37,223
Wha--?

201
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:40,352
Quit gapin' like a fish.

202
00:13:40,435 --> 00:13:43,688
I'm sayin' I'll let you
into the Black Bulls.

203
00:13:43,772 --> 00:13:46,274
[NOELLE] Captain Yami
took a liking to you.

204
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:49,444
And since then,

205
00:13:49,527 --> 00:13:52,655
no matter how
severely you got hurt,

206
00:13:52,739 --> 00:13:55,450
you never gave up.

207
00:13:55,533 --> 00:13:58,703
No matter how many
times you fell,

208
00:13:58,787 --> 00:14:04,000
you always, always got
back on your feet.

209
00:14:05,418 --> 00:14:08,880
[ASTA]
Right here, right now.

210
00:14:08,963 --> 00:14:12,384
I'm going to push
past my limits!

211
00:14:12,467 --> 00:14:15,345
Whatever comes at you,
you fight your way through it.

212
00:14:15,428 --> 00:14:18,306
You're truly incredible.

213
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,391
[gasps]

214
00:14:19,474 --> 00:14:22,268
Uh, but only a little bit!

215
00:14:22,352 --> 00:14:25,855
Thanks a lot, Noelle!
You're pretty awesome, yourself!

216
00:14:29,567 --> 00:14:32,028
[ASTA] You've got a
crazy amount of mana,

217
00:14:32,112 --> 00:14:33,613
and you keep on
learning how to use

218
00:14:33,697 --> 00:14:35,740
better and better techniques!

219
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:44,207
[ASTA] Your water clothes
are super cool, too!

220
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:46,042
[NOELLE]
It's got a name, you idiot.

221
00:14:46,126 --> 00:14:47,919
It's called Valkyrie Armor!

222
00:14:48,003 --> 00:14:49,212
[ASTA]
Yeah, that!

223
00:14:49,295 --> 00:14:51,047
You knew what
I was talking about!

224
00:14:53,925 --> 00:14:55,427
[ASTA]
Anyway, you rock!

225
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:58,680
Well, no need to
make such a fuss.

226
00:14:58,763 --> 00:15:01,057
We've really been through
a lot of challenges, though,

227
00:15:01,141 --> 00:15:02,183
haven't we?

228
00:15:02,267 --> 00:15:03,893
[ASTA]
True.

229
00:15:03,977 --> 00:15:06,187
And I'm sure, in the future,

230
00:15:06,271 --> 00:15:07,856
we'll face even
greater obstacles,

231
00:15:07,939 --> 00:15:11,901
things that we can't even
imagine yet. Don't you think?

232
00:15:11,985 --> 00:15:14,070
Yeah, good thing
we have the captains.

233
00:15:14,154 --> 00:15:16,406
And all the other Magic Knights!

234
00:15:16,489 --> 00:15:18,575
Plus, we're tougher now!

235
00:15:18,658 --> 00:15:19,993
We're gonna put
our skills together

236
00:15:20,076 --> 00:15:21,953
and protect the Clover Kingdom!

237
00:15:22,037 --> 00:15:24,456
No matter what it takes!

238
00:15:24,539 --> 00:15:26,166
Let's become stronger!

239
00:15:26,249 --> 00:15:28,460
Oh, yeah. Way stronger!

240
00:15:32,756 --> 00:15:37,594
[yawns] I'm sorry, what's so
interesting about this exam?

241
00:15:38,887 --> 00:15:41,556
I see, you're too
cool to respond!

242
00:15:49,314 --> 00:15:51,858
Asta, wait up!
Where are you going?

243
00:15:53,818 --> 00:15:56,488
[ASTA]
Hey, Yuno!

244
00:15:56,571 --> 00:15:58,323
Great, this guy again.

245
00:15:58,406 --> 00:16:00,450
Heh. You're here, too, huh?

246
00:16:00,533 --> 00:16:02,077
I know you're
Mr. Cool and everything,

247
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,246
but you can't just walk by me
without saying hello first!

248
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:06,498
Meh.

249
00:16:06,581 --> 00:16:08,541
Wait. Did you just say "meh"?

250
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:11,086
Who does that?
You think you're so great!

251
00:16:11,169 --> 00:16:12,921
He doesn't think, he knows.

252
00:16:13,004 --> 00:16:14,297
[ASTA]
Are you kidding me?

253
00:16:14,381 --> 00:16:17,676
He's not cool at all,
he's only trying to be cool!

254
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,803
What do you mean by "trying"?

255
00:16:19,886 --> 00:16:22,263
Yuno doesn't need
to try to be cool.

256
00:16:22,347 --> 00:16:24,724
'Cause it comes
naturally for him, dork!

257
00:16:24,808 --> 00:16:27,352
Well, anyway, if you came here,

258
00:16:27,435 --> 00:16:30,105
then I guess you're
thinking about our promise.

259
00:16:30,188 --> 00:16:31,481
What promise?

260
00:16:31,564 --> 00:16:34,609
That someday,
I'll be the Wizard King.

261
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:36,111
Like you could!

262
00:16:36,194 --> 00:16:37,904
Well, not just me.

263
00:16:42,951 --> 00:16:44,327
I...

264
00:16:44,411 --> 00:16:46,955
I'm never going to cry again.

265
00:16:47,038 --> 00:16:48,873
I've decided.

266
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,543
What do you mean?

267
00:16:51,626 --> 00:16:53,086
I'll do it, too.

268
00:16:53,169 --> 00:16:55,839
I'm going to become
the Wizard King.

269
00:16:55,922 --> 00:16:57,215
I'll work hard and get strong

270
00:16:57,298 --> 00:17:00,260
so I can protect you
and everybody else.

271
00:17:00,343 --> 00:17:04,556
I'll do whatever it takes,
and I'll never give up!

272
00:17:13,481 --> 00:17:16,109
[YUNO, ASTA] We'll fight to see
who will be the Wizard King.

273
00:17:16,192 --> 00:17:18,028
Whatever it takes.

274
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:24,117
Okay, but it's
still gonna be me.

275
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,870
Nah, the title's mine
and you know it is!

276
00:17:26,953 --> 00:17:28,663
It's mine, for sure.

00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:30,165
[ASTA]
Nuh-uh!

278
00:17:35,378 --> 00:17:37,797
[YAMI]
So, do you rookies feel like

279
00:17:37,881 --> 00:17:39,966
you got back to your
roots or whatever?

280
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:41,843
Yeah, it was awesome, thank you!

281
00:17:41,926 --> 00:17:43,219
Yes.

282
00:17:43,303 --> 00:17:44,346
All right.

283
00:17:44,429 --> 00:17:46,848
I'm feeling more
motivated now as well.

284
00:17:46,931 --> 00:17:49,225
I swear, I'll
strengthen my magic,

285
00:17:49,309 --> 00:17:51,853
and fortify my bonds
with friends!

286
00:17:51,936 --> 00:17:54,522
Same here.
I'll give it my all

287
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:57,817
and help to make the Black Bulls
the greatest team ever!

288
00:17:57,901 --> 00:17:59,652
Also, I'll break
my curse and prove

289
00:17:59,736 --> 00:18:02,655
I'm worthy of
Lady Finnes's hand!

290

[ASTA]
Let's do our best, guys!

291
00:18:04,741 --> 00:18:07,911
By the way, Captain, did we
recruit any new people?

292
00:18:07,994 --> 00:18:10,705
Am I taking on a protégé?

293
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:13,166
There was one
that I kinda liked.

294
00:18:13,249 --> 00:18:15,418
[BOTH]
Yeah?

295
00:18:15,502 --> 00:18:17,545
But then another squad
snapped 'em up.

00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:19,297
[BOTH groan]

297
00:18:19,381 --> 00:18:21,424
Which means you two
have to stay at the bottom

298
00:18:21,508 --> 00:18:23,218
for at least another whole year.

299
00:18:23,301 --> 00:18:25,637
[ASTA, NOELLE yelp]

300
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,180
[YAMI]
Come on, let's go.

301
00:18:38,316 --> 00:18:40,985
[MARX]
I knew I'd find you here.

302
00:18:41,069 --> 00:18:43,988
Ah, hello, Marx.
This is a coincidence.

303
00:18:44,072 --> 00:18:46,366
I don't see what's so
coincidental about you

304
00:18:46,449 --> 00:18:49,327
sneaking out of the
castle yet again.

305
00:18:49,411 --> 00:18:50,704
We should get back.

306
00:18:50,787 --> 00:18:53,581
Your work is
constantly piling up.

307
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:55,000
I'm well aware.

308
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:56,292
You know...

309
00:18:56,376 --> 00:18:57,711
[MARX]
Yes?

310
00:18:57,794 --> 00:18:59,379
[JULIUS] It's inspiring to see
this many young people

311
00:18:59,462 --> 00:19:01,006
building their skills
so they can join

312
00:19:01,089 --> 00:19:04,509
the Magic Knights
and protect our land.

313
00:19:04,592 --> 00:19:06,177
That's why I wanted
to come here.

314
00:19:06,261 --> 00:19:09,180
The sight of it is extremely
encouraging to me.

315
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:12,559
Yes. You're right.

316
00:19:12,642 --> 00:19:14,978
They give us hope, don't they?

317
00:19:17,605 --> 00:19:20,233
Now then, shall we depart?

318
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,486
I've been meaning
to ask you, Marx,

319
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:26,031
do you enjoy eating
grilled violet snake?

320
00:19:26,114 --> 00:19:28,408
Is that a real question?

321
00:19:28,491 --> 00:19:29,909
[JULIUS]
If you do,

322
00:19:29,993 --> 00:19:32,620
I was thinking I could catch one
and cook it for you soon.

323
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:34,706
[MARX]
That won't be necessary, sir.

324
00:19:34,789 --> 00:19:38,251
[JULIUS] Aw, I bet Asta would
be more than happy to have some!

325
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,590
[WILLIAM]
Yuno.

326
00:19:45,091 --> 00:19:47,635
I have something for you.

327
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:48,970
[YUNO]
What is it?

328
00:19:52,223 --> 00:19:55,435
[gasps] It's my old pendant.

329
00:19:55,518 --> 00:19:57,896
But how?

330
00:19:57,979 --> 00:20:00,148
[WILLIAM] A man named
Revchi brought it.

331
00:20:00,231 --> 00:20:01,858
Is that true?

332
00:20:08,239 --> 00:20:09,783
From what I understand,
it was one

333
00:20:09,866 --> 00:20:12,744
of the many valuable artifacts
that he and Gueldre took

334
00:20:12,827 --> 00:20:15,330
when they robbed
the Shadow Palace.

335
00:20:15,413 --> 00:20:17,457
He was probably afraid of
what you would do to him

336
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,542
if you ever discovered
that he had it,

337
00:20:19,626 --> 00:20:22,712
so he thought it
wise to return it.

338
00:20:22,796 --> 00:20:24,673
I'm relieved to know
that your magic stone

339
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:26,716
is back in your hands.

340
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,802
Me, too.

341
00:20:28,885 --> 00:20:31,805
I never expected he'd be
the one to return it to me.

342
00:20:31,888 --> 00:20:33,723
Strange.

343
00:20:33,807 --> 00:20:35,975
I'm so happy for you!

344
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:38,311
Today marks one year.

345
00:20:38,395 --> 00:20:40,772
You've been an
irreplaceable asset.

346
00:20:40,855 --> 00:20:42,482
I'm grateful.

347
00:20:42,565 --> 00:20:44,317
[gasps]

348
00:20:44,401 --> 00:20:46,611
Make me proud, Yuno.

349
00:20:46,695 --> 00:20:49,864
Now then, everyone's
waiting. Let's go.

350
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:03,461
All right! Y'ready?

351
00:21:03,545 --> 00:21:05,547
[ASTA]
For more training? Heck yeah!

352
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:08,925
Are you crazy? No,
we're partyin' tonight.

353
00:21:09,009 --> 00:21:10,969
[BOTH]
Partying?

354
00:21:11,052 --> 00:21:12,554
[FINRAL] Yeah, it's the
one-year anniversary

355
00:21:12,637 --> 00:21:15,140
of you two joining the squad!

356
00:21:15,223 --> 00:21:16,975
[GORDON] There's a lot
going on right now,

357
00:21:17,058 --> 00:21:20,562
but we wanted to do something
for you, at least.

358
00:21:20,645 --> 00:21:24,441
[YAMI] Magna and the others
should be back soon, too.

359
00:21:24,524 --> 00:21:25,817
Thank you, guys!

360
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,820
I guess I'll let you
celebrate me, if you want to.

361
00:21:28,903 --> 00:21:30,697
Okay! Just for tonight,

362
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:33,867
let's all forget about fighting
and really let loose!

363
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:36,119
[BOTH]
Yes, sir!

364
00:21:36,202 --> 00:21:38,121
It's time to have some fun!

365
00:21:38,204 --> 00:21:40,290
A whole night of bonding
with my best friends.

366
00:21:40,373 --> 00:21:41,624
Knock, knock.

367
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:43,668
Hey, Charmy, we're back!

368
00:21:51,926 --> 00:21:55,430
[ASTA] I've gotten a lot
stronger in the past year.

369
00:22:00,518 --> 00:22:01,853
[YUNO]
Now.

370
00:22:03,521 --> 00:22:05,148
[ASTA]
Better keep going!

371
00:22:06,608 --> 00:22:08,985
[YUNO] I'll keep
reaching greater heights

372
00:22:09,069 --> 00:22:12,906
until I become the Wizard King!

373
00:22:12,989 --> 00:22:16,826
[ASTA] I'll work as hard
as I can, and one day,

374
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:19,162
I'll be the next Wizard King!

375
00:23:56,676 --> 00:23:58,845
[YAMI] It's been a whole year
since Noelle and the kid

376
00:23:58,928 --> 00:24:00,430
joined the Black Bulls.

377
00:24:00,513 --> 00:24:02,432
Man, time really
flies, doesn't it?

378
00:24:02,515 --> 00:24:06,478
<i>Black Clover</i> , Page 153:
"The Chosen Ones."

379
00:24:06,561 --> 00:24:08,146
You wanna get stronger, huh?

380
00:24:08,229 --> 00:24:10,523
Then, put your money
where your mouth is!
