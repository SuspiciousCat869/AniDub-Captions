1
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,708
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:18,458
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:24,375
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:27,083
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:35,500
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:39,708
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:43,708
[NARRATOR] A young Yami
was out training when

8
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:45,708
he received a request
to protect a village

9
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:47,625
from a group of bandit mages.

10
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:49,208
But before he knew it,
he found himself

11
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:50,833
outnumbered and surrounded.

12
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:52,541
And, during that
fateful fight...

13
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:54,333
[WILLIAM]
Yami, I believe your name was?

14
00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:57,083
Watch my back,
if you wouldn't mind.

15
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:59,166
[NARRATOR]
Yami met William Vangeance.

16
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,958
who was on his own
mission nearby.

17
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:04,833
I intend to become the captain
of a Magic Knight Squad.

18
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:06,583
Then it's a contest.

19
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:09,666
Let's see who gets there first.

20
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,833
[YAMI] After all that, a whole
bunch of stuff happened.

21
00:01:12,916 --> 00:01:14,166
Years went by.

22
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,541
Ol' Julius was crowned
as the Wizard King.

23
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:20,333
And as for me and my
new pal Goldiguts...

24
00:01:20,416 --> 00:01:21,875
..both of us ended up
getting promoted

25
00:01:21,958 --> 00:01:24,416
to vice captain
of the Grey Deer.

26
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,625
Then, one day...

27
00:01:26,708 --> 00:01:29,333
Ah, yes! It's
wonderful to see you.

28
00:01:29,416 --> 00:01:30,708
How are things?

29
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:33,041
[YAMI] Let's skip the small
talk, if you don't mind.

30
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:34,750
[WILLIAM]
I agree.

31
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:36,791
By the way, William,
I was happy to hear about

32
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:38,750
your excellent work
investigating the dungeon

33
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:40,000
that was recently discovered.

34
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:42,000
Oh, that was nothing, sir.

35
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:43,500
Don't be so modest!

36
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:45,333
You valiantly used
your magic to rescue

37
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:46,916
your trapped squadmates!

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,375
Boy, I wish I
could've seen that!

39
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:52,041
Ah, and such a noble
effort is obviously

40
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:54,291
worthy of a star! Nice work!

41
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:57,000
[WILLIAM] I'm honored.
Thank you, Your Majesty.

42
00:01:58,583 --> 00:02:00,708
[JULIUS] And apparently,
you fought like a man possessed

43
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:03,708
during the treacherous battle
to defend the Village of Kuka.

44
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:04,958
Correct me if I'm wrong,

45
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,583
but I believe I heard
you sliced the enemy's

46
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:08,958
giant Stone Magic
warrior in two!

47
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:11,541
Oh, come on,
that was... amazing!

48
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:14,333
And I'm gonna get a star
for my heroics, too, right?

49
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:15,708
[JULIUS]
Of course!

50
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:18,625
Your captain must be beaming
with pride right now!

51
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:21,083
[MARX]
Wizard King? It's time, sir.

52
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:23,291
[JULIUS]
Right, I almost forgot.

53
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:25,000
I appreciate you
coming all this way

54
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:26,583
when you're so busy, but...

55
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:28,208
[YAMI, WILLIAM]
But?

56
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:30,083
It would appear that
I have a new assignment

57
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:32,000
lined up for you to do.

58
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:35,583
[YAMI, WILLIAM]
Bandits?

59
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:38,541
Indeed. They've been
making mischief all over.

60
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:41,125
Do you think you could
take care of them for us?

61
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:44,208
Certainly. We're Magic
Knights, after all.

62
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:46,833
We're here to serve the people
of the Clover Kingdom.

63
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:50,125
So we'll go, and
happily. However...

64
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:52,916
Why are you sending
us and only us?

65
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,625
[JULIUS] Well, we have reason
to believe that these bandits

66
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,166
may be receiving
help from someone

67
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,791
who's part of the Magic Knights.

68
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:01,166
Ah, so it'll take
a little finesse.

69
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,541
[JULIUS]
Hm. This isn't just

70
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:04,708
some ordinary band
of miscreants.

71
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:06,833
From what we've observed,
we understand these people

72
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:08,791
are considerably powerful,
their leadership

73
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,583
is unusually strong,
and they're currently

74
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:13,208
in possession of ancient
magic items. Plus...

75
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:14,791
It seems they may
have absconded with

76
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:17,708
some magic artifacts that
were found in the dungeons.

77
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:19,250
So you came to us.

78
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:20,791
Well, guess that makes sense.

79
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,541
[WILLIAM] If you'd addressed
the Magic Knights as a whole,

80
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:24,250
someone within the ranks
could've disposed

81
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:26,291
of evidence that might
reveal the truth.

82
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:29,083
That's why we need to
handle it discreetly.

83
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:31,250
[JULIUS]
That about covers it.

84
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:33,208
Just one thing, though, Julius.

85
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:35,166
What're you gonna do if it
turns out William and I

86
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,125
were the big traitors all along?

87
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:39,750
We would prob'ly turn a blind
eye to those bandits, right?

88
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:42,041
Indeed, that would be a problem.

89
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:43,416
But then...

90
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,291
...I like to believe I know
you fellows fairly well.

91
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:48,083
Even from the days
before you became

92
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:49,750
members of the Magic Knights.

93
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,166
So I'm assuming it's
safe to trust you.

94
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,083
Although, if you do
decide to betray me,

95
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:55,875
I guess that's
the way life goes.

96
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:59,125
Heh. You got a strange
outlook on life, Julius.

97
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,916
Marx, would you
please do the honors?

98
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,208
[MARX]
Yes, sir.

99
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,291
[MARX] The towns and villages
that have been attacked

100
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:09,041
by the bandits are
indicated here.

101
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,833
Oh, I see. They're
all over the place.

102
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:13,625
They must not want us
to figure out which area

103
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,875
they're gonna go
after next, huh?

104
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:18,000
[MARX] We've sent word to
local Magic Knight squads

105
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:20,500
telling them to be extra
vigilant, but even that bit

106
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:22,875
of information could
be subject to leaks.

107
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:27,000
They tend to focus on the
places with weaker defenses.

108
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:28,750
So basically, we're gonna
have to guess at what

109
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:31,333
their next target'll be
and hope we get it right.

110
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:33,375
And that will not
be an easy task.

111
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:35,250
No. I think it will be.

112
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:36,583
Huh?

113
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,333
[WILLIAM] We can start by
ruling out all the spots

114
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:40,000
that have already been hit.

115
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:42,208
The places that are most at
risk would be where treasure

116
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:44,750
has recently been discovered,
or anywhere a harvest

117
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:48,333
is about to take place.
Especially a large one.

118
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:49,958
That's real nice detective work,

119
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:52,125
but we're still lookin'
at one or two dozen here.

120
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,000
We can exclude any
location that's near

121
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:56,750
a place they've already
attacked, as well.

122
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:58,791
And they'll most likely
avoid any areas

123
00:04:58,875 --> 00:04:59,916
that are on high alert.

124
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,250
Maybe, but--

125
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:02,625
But that's too many for just

126
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:05,166
the two of us to manage.
I'm well aware.

127
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,458
So...

128
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,041
[WILLIAM] Here and here.
This village, as well.

129
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:14,250
Could you dispatch some
squads to these three areas

130
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:15,833
to watch for bandits?

131
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,250
[YAMI]
What for?

132
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,583
If word gets out, it'll be
all for nothin' anyway y--

133
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:22,833
That's brilliant! And assuming
the information does get leaked,

134
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:25,500
we can simply use it
to our advantage.

135
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:27,541
Correct. It's safe
to assume the bandits

136
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:30,000
will avoid the regions
where Magic Knights are.

137
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:32,083
They're probably going to
appear where they believe

138
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,125
no one will be waiting for them.

139
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,833
Uh. Yeah, obviously I knew that.

140
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:40,625
I was just makin' sure you
knew it, too, that's all.

141
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,375
Anyway, it looks like
we've narrowed it down

142
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:44,375
to one of two spots.

143
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:47,791
The town of Aymaia
or Zocodany Village.

144
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,416
[WILLIAM]
How does it look there, Yami?

145
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,875
[YAMI]
Everything's quiet right now.

146
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:30,083
[WILLIAM] Apparently,
a very old magic item

147
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:33,250
was recently found inside
a cave near Zocodany.

148
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,666
It's currently being kept
inside the chief's house

149
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,166
and revered as a precious
village treasure.

150
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,500
That sounds like the
kind of info only a handful

151
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:43,583
of Magic Knights would've
gotten wind of, right?

152
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:46,083
[WILLIAM] Exactly, if the
bandits show up in Zocodany

153
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,791
looking for that treasure,
then they would have

154
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,916
received their intel
far too quickly.

155
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,791
In which case, there's no doubt
we have a traitor in our midst.

156
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:56,458
[YAMI]
Got it. How's Aymaia?

157
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,833
It seems to be
all clear, as well.

158
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,583
They're done reaping,
and now they're preparing

159
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,375
for their harvest festival.

160
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:05,000
It's sure to be a
plentiful crop this year.

161
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:09,041
[YAMI] Well, that'll give the
bandits something to steal.

162
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:11,250
[WILLIAM] Look, just so
we're on the same page,

163
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,208
no matter which of us
sees the thieves first,

164
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:14,875
we shouldn't do it alone.

165
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:17,416
We should contact each
other and wait to attack

166
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,875
until we're both
present. Agreed?

167
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,583
[YAMI]
Yeah, yeah.

168
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,416
But you better not
pull a fast one on me

169
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,375
and try to get all
the stars for yourself!

170
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,416
[laughs] I'd never!

171
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,083
Anyway, I'll let you know
if I notice any movement.

172
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:32,500
[YAMI]
Tch.

173
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,208
[YAMI]
Guess it's that time.

174
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:48,458
Hey, Mask Boy,
they're on the move.

175
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:50,250
You there? Hey!

176
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:56,041
The hell? It was
workin' fine earlier.

177
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:57,958
There's somethin' about this ki.

178
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:01,333
[YAMI] Are those guys blockin'
the flow of mana somehow?

179
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,875
They gotta be doin'
somethin' to break up

180
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:05,125
our lines of communication.

181
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:07,875
These are not your
run-o'-the-mill bandits.

182
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,791
[YAMI]
That means there is a traitor.

183
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:14,875
Now we just have
to figure out who.

184
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:18,250
Looks like about 30 of 'em--
No, more than that.

185
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:21,375
I'm gonna say it's around 50.

186
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,375
No matter which of us
sees the thieves first,

187
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:27,166
we shouldn't do it alone.
We should contact each other.

188
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,875
[YAMI] Well, we can't
contact each other,

189
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:34,125
so I'm movin' onto Plan B.
Sorry, I'm goin' solo.

190
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:41,666
[YAMI] I'll stop 'em
before they get there.

191
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,500
Dark Cloaked.

192

[BANDITS yell]

194
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:50,541
Who's back there?

195
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:51,958
[BANDITS scream]

196
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:54,083
Spread out, we've been spotted!

197
00:09:57,791 --> 00:09:58,750
Who is this guy?

198
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,250
A Magic Knight?

199
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,250
You've got guts
fighting us all alone!

200
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:05,041
Yeah, big mistake, pal!

201
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:08,000
Whatever. Dark Magic:
Dark Cloaked,

[BANDITS scream]

204
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,375
Heh. That got about half of 'em.

205
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,250
[YAMI coughs]

206
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:32,875
You must be the bossman!

207
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:35,125
Wait, I think I know you.

208
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:37,750
That's odd, you don't
look like a Magic Knight.

209
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:40,125
Huh. Hey, I recognize you.

210
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:42,458
Yeah, you're gonna
have to remind me.

211
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,666
[BANDIT BOSS 85A]
Years ago, you were the one

212
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,916
who interfered with our attack
on that pathetic village.

213
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,625
Who knew I'd get to
settle the score here?

214
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,291
I don't follow.

215
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:59,458
Oh! That was you!
I remember now.

216
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:01,291
[YAMI] He looks flashy,
but he actually doesn't have

217
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:03,875
a whole lot of magic
power to speak of.

218
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:06,250
That wand he's got is
another story, though.

219
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,125
I betcha anything it's
a priceless treasure

220
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:10,500
that was dug up in
one of those dungeons.

221
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:11,791
[BANDIT BOSS 85A]
I've changed quite a bit

222
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:13,291
since the last time we fought.

223
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:16,625
Who cares? I'm more interested
in who gave you that wand.

224
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:19,208
You wanna find out,
you'll have to beat me first!

225
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:24,541
It's over!

226
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:25,791
[DRAGON roars]

227
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:28,833
[yells]

228
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:38,208
[YAMI] That turned out to
be a whole lotta nothin'.

229
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:42,916
Now. Speak up, and I want
every single detail.

230
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,916
Who was it that gave ya
this fancy magic wand?

231
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,541
Five seconds. And now four...

232
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52,416
[BANDIT BOSS 85A]
Okay, okay, I'll tell you!

233
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,333
Uh, the truth is...

234
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,333
Ah!

235
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:58,916
Get back inside!

236
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:04,625
That's it. Don't you move,
Mr. Magic Knight!

237
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:08,291
Take one step,
and the old lady dies!

238
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:10,750
Then you're gonna suffer
a hundred times worse!

239
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,125
What does that mean?

240
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:13,833
Your little buddies won't
do you any more good

241
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:15,500
than they did
last time we fought.

242
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:19,833
No, you're obviously capable
of defeating my men. But this...

243
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:29,250
[YAMI]
What the--?

244
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:30,500
[MOHL] That's an Earth
Magic spell by the name

245
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:34,250
of Witch Hunter Claws.
Impressive, isn't it?

246
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:36,750
And that's not all.

247
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,791
You're also trapped
by a Binding spell

248
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,750
called Sheep Horn Snag.

249
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:43,291
Wait a sec. Don't I
know you two?

250
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,250
[MOHL, GOHT cackle]

251
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:48,333
[YAMI] That's right,
Crimson Goht and Silver Mohl!

252
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:51,250
I never thought there'd
be two traitors among us.

253
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,291
You guys have been feeding
those bandits intel

254
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,708
and magic items
so they would go out

255
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:58,750
and attack the villages
and towns. Haven't you?

256
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:00,875
That won't help you.

257
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:03,416
You can't break those bonds
with mortal strength.

258
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:08,541
You're a damn disgrace to
Magic Knights everywhere!

259
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:10,166
[GOHT]
Ah, I remember!

260
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,750
You're that foreigner

261
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,791
just promoted, aren't
you? Yami Sukehiro.

262
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:17,375
I suspected he might
be plotting something.

263
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:19,125
I guess this means
I was correct.

264
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:21,000
[MOHL] In other words,
when the Wizard King ordered

265
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,000
the Magic Knights to guard
these areas against

266
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:25,875
bandit invasions, it was
nothing but a simple diversion.

267
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:28,333
An attempt to narrow down
where we'd strike next

268
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:30,666
and you fell for it,
hook, line, and sinker!

269
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,666
I have to say, the whole
situation's terribly amusing!

Excellent, you two managed

to capture him just
in the nick of time!

have no problems with traps!

and go look for that treasure!

Yes, sir!

[YAMI] The Magic Knights are
supposed to protect the people,

281
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:58,583
not ransack their towns!
You're both monsters!

282
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:01,125
We'll be certain to fulfil
our duty as Magic Knights

283
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,958
by making the Wizard King
aware that there's been

284
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:04,833
a bandit incident in this area.

Don't go thinkin' you'll
finish me off that easily.

Anyway, we're done here.

289
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,000
How much longer can
you keep that up?

290
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:23,208
Might as well surrender already.

291
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:26,000
Nah, it'll take a whole
lot more than this.

292
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:29,625
I'm not done!
I'll break through!

293
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:32,333
[MOHL] Surely you've exhausted
all your strength by now.

294
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:34,333
I'm just getting started.

295
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:40,666

push past it! Here and now!

'Bout time.

I got here as
quickly as I could.

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,708
I realized we'd been cut off.

And then, well, the
only logical assumption

304
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:15,416
was that the bandits must
have appeared in Zocodany.

I owe ya one, then.

00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,416
the Wizard King's
orders as well?

312
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,750
Then we'll just eliminate
you and Yami Sukehiro

313
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,458
in one fell swoop.

314
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:44,791
This again.

315
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,000
Now, Attack of the Horn!

316
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,375
Dark Cloaked, Lightless Slash!

317
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:04,041
[GOHT groans]

318
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:07,625
I believe I said
I'd pay you back

319
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:10,375
a million times over, didn't I?

320
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:13,583
Um. Please go easy on me,
if you don't mind!

321
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:20,791
Not bad at all, if you ask me.

322
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:23,375
Let me suggest something while
I've got your attention.

323
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:26,041
I think you should consider
coming over to our side.

324
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:27,291
Your side?

325
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:29,416
[MOHL] Sure, it's a lot
of fun working with us.

326
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,291
My, how tempting.

327
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:33,458
Thank you, but I refuse.

328
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:35,041
I'm afraid I've
sworn my absolute

329
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:36,583
loyalty to the Wizard King.

330
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:38,291
Yes, of course you have.

331
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:40,375
Well, that's a terrible shame.

332
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:52,750
I figure that makes
us about even.

333
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:55,958
[WILLIAM]
You're right, it is a shame.

334
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:57,583
A shame that there
were traitors hiding

335
00:16:57,666 --> 00:17:00,166
among the ranks of
the Magic Knights.

336
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,750
[MOHL screams]

337
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,458
[WILLIAM]
Now then. One last thing.

338
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:10,791
Uh-huh.

339
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,291
Whoever that is,
go get rid of him!

340
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:21,083
[BANDITS yell]

341
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,208
[JULIUS] I didn't intend
to involve myself.

342
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:27,916
I mean, maybe a little bit.

343
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:31,625
[BOTH gasp]

344
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:35,875
Guess we're done.

345
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,250
[JULIUS]
Splendid job, you two!

346
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,458
Not only did you discover
the Magic Knight traitors

347
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:43,333
and capture them, but you
managed to round up

348
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:44,916
the entire bandit group!

349
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,750
[YAMI]
To be fair, we found the bossman

350
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,666
unconscious up in a tree.

351
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:52,666
[JULIUS laughs]
Sometimes, things just work out!

352
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:57,583
But, with my deepest sincerity,
you both did well.

353
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:01,458
[JULIUS]
Yami. William.

354
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:04,666
I'm so impressed with
your performance.

355
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,125
I'd like to invite
you to be captains

356
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:08,333
of two new Magic Knight squads.

357
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:10,208
You're kidding.

358
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:13,208
You're asking us to
lead our own squads?

359
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:15,166
I hope that you'll accept.

360
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:20,958
So if both of us made
the captain spot at once,

361
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:22,208
I guess it's a tie.

362
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:24,958
That's true. But the
real race lies ahead.

363
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,708
Uh-huh.

364
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:27,708
I'll win. Watch.

365
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:28,958
Keep dreamin'.

366
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,291
I have every confidence in you.

367
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:33,958
So, Yami, what kind of squad
would you like to form?

368
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:37,291
What kind, huh? How do I put it?

369
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:42,750
Lemme see. How about a place
for misfits to belong.

370
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,500
Where things like your
rank and bloodline

371
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,250
don't make any difference.

372
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,583
Where even hooligans
are welcome.

373
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,916
You know, like the
home you gave me.

374
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,375
I see! An excellent idea!

375
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:56,666
As for the name...
Gimme a second.

376
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,208
If I want lotsa
different people,

377
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:00,416
bringin' all their
colors to the table,

378
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,208
mixin' 'em up till
it's a big mess...

379
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:04,541
Hm...

380
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,583
Oh! If you put a buncha
different colors together,

381
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:07,875
you get black!

382
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:11,500
So I'll call us the Black,
uh, the Black Bulls!

383
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:14,083
The Black Bulls
it is! Nice choice.

384
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,375
It suits you well.
And your team?

385
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:17,500
If I could,

386
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:19,500
I'd like to call mine
the Golden Dawn.

387
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:20,416
[JULIUS]
Golden Dawn?

388
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,458
That's right.

389
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:23,208
And when it becomes
the best of all,

390
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:25,666
consider it my tribute to you.

391
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,541
True to its name,
my squad will bring

392
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,625
the shining gold of
dawn to our world,

393
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:32,166
covering it with
warmth and light.

394
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,791
Just as sunlight pierces
even the darkest night,

395
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:36,458
we'll serve as a
reminder to the people

396
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:38,458
that daybreak is sure to come.

397
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:40,791
[YAMI] You think really
highly of yourself.

398
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:42,166
Such a beautiful sentiment.

399
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,333
I'm expecting great things.

400
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,083
Starting today,
I hereby name you

401
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:48,250
the official captain
of the Golden Dawn.

402
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,041
Congratulations to you, William.

403
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:51,291
[WILLIAM]
Sir.

404
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,791
[JULIUS]
And, Yami, from this moment on,

405
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,458
you will be
recognized as founder

406
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:58,166
and leader of the Black Bulls.

407
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,458
Best of luck, Captain.

408
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:06,375
[YAMI]
Let's do this, Goldiguts.

409
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:13,625
[YAMI]
And that's that.

410
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:14,750
Uh...

411
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:15,875
Neat, huh?

412
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:19,416
Well, uh, a bunch of
stuff did happen.

413
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,375
Um, what's the point you
were tryin' to make again?

414
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:24,375
You know! To never give up!

415
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:26,666
No matter how many times
you may fall down!

416
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,583
Even if you're about
to lose it all!

417
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:30,500
You can't quit on your dreams!

418
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:32,375
Always push past your limits!

419
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:35,416
So what if your rival outdid ya
this one time, that's nothin'!

420
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,625
If you lose 99 battles,
just win the 100th!

421
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,916
Um. I'll keep that in mind.

422
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,375
Could've said it from
the start, though--

423
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:44,625
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

424
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:46,041
I'm sorry, that was
a great story--

00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:47,750
please don't crush my head!

426
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:50,416
You know, the captain said
some smart stuff in there.

427

There's no reason to be sad!

All right! Time to work
hard, catch up to Yuno,

429
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:57,208

Hey, that reminds me.

back the results from
