The Clover Kingdom.

00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,683
In this place where
magic is everything,

3
00:00:26,766 --> 00:00:29,561
there lives a magicless
boy named Asta.

4
00:00:29,644 --> 00:00:32,439
This brave young hero devotes
blood, sweat, and tears

5
00:00:32,522 --> 00:00:34,607
to becoming the
next Wizard King.

6
00:00:34,691 --> 00:00:38,028
Though Asta's situation
is practically unheard of,

7
00:00:38,111 --> 00:00:40,488
there are others residing
in this kingdom who possess

8
00:00:40,572 --> 00:00:42,699
at least a tiny amount of mana,

9
00:00:42,782 --> 00:00:45,243
yet can barely
use spells at all.

10
00:00:45,326 --> 00:00:47,912
They make up a very
small minority,

11
00:00:47,996 --> 00:00:50,415
living their lives
in the shadows.

But, like everyone else,

Could you repeat that?

I'm good enough for you?

[DAZU]
Hello, ma'am.

26
00:03:22,359 --> 00:03:24,569
You don't use any magic.

27

And yet, somehow, you do just
as much as everyone else does.

[FINRAL]
Wow.

29
00:03:41,711 --> 00:03:43,004
I know.

30
00:03:43,088 --> 00:03:45,048
There's so many graves here,
you can't count 'em all.

31
00:03:45,131 --> 00:03:48,426
Wonder how many popped up
after the big attack.

32

[FINRAL]
Um, hello, miss.

33

Pardon me.

34
00:04:00,063 --> 00:04:03,024
Would you mind if
I asked you a question?

35
00:04:03,108 --> 00:04:04,859
Sure, that's all right.

36
00:04:04,943 --> 00:04:09,072
[FINRAL]
Have you seen this little girl?

37
00:04:09,155 --> 00:04:11,491
We're also trying to find
a beautiful young lady

38
00:04:11,574 --> 00:04:13,785
with a pair of
horns on her head.

39
00:04:13,868 --> 00:04:17,038
[DAZU] Horns? I'm sorry,
I don't understand.

00:04:17,122 --> 00:04:18,289
[YAMI]
No dice?

41
00:04:18,373 --> 00:04:20,000
This might ring a bell.

42
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:21,167
You know anything about a group

43
00:04:21,251 --> 00:04:24,045
that's got a grudge
against devils?

44
00:04:24,129 --> 00:04:28,049
I would assume everyone
has something against devils.

45
00:04:28,133 --> 00:04:29,384
You know about
the one that caused

46
00:04:29,467 --> 00:04:32,887
all the destruction
here, don't you?

47
00:04:32,971 --> 00:04:35,015
Yeah, I do.

48
00:04:35,098 --> 00:04:38,351
[DAZU] Judging by your cloaks,
I take it you're Magic Knights.

[YAMI]
We are.

50
00:04:39,811 --> 00:04:45,400
I lost my husband in
that attack and his mother.

51
00:04:45,483 --> 00:04:48,194
Why didn't any of you
show up to help us?

52
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:52,157
Our numbers were
stretched way too thin.

53

The whole kingdom was in chaos!

54

[YAMI]
I'm sorry.

55

Because we weren't here,
your loved ones died.

I have a question.

62
00:05:31,821 --> 00:05:34,157
Does this girl look
familiar to you?

[NOELLE] We're here looking
for her and another girl

who has horns on her head.

Please let us know
if you see them anywhere.

Hang on, did you say horns?

Nope, can't say that I have.

00:05:59,808 --> 00:06:01,267
But you didn't even look!

Sorry, but I'm a little
busy right now.

78
00:06:03,812 --> 00:06:06,481
My house was just
torn to pieces recently.

79
00:06:06,564 --> 00:06:09,109
And no one came
to help us rebuild.

Let him.

82
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:14,614
[NOELLE]
What's wrong with them?

83
00:06:14,698 --> 00:06:17,242
They're being indirect.

84
00:06:17,325 --> 00:06:19,661
But it's obvious that the people
in this village are angry

85
00:06:19,744 --> 00:06:21,996
at the Magic Knights for
the way things were handled

86
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,249
after what happened
to their home.

87
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:27,335
We can't blame them.

88
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:29,462
It's our job to protect
the Clover Kingdom,

89
00:06:29,546 --> 00:06:33,133
and we weren't able to be here
when they needed us the most.

90
00:06:33,216 --> 00:06:35,802
You're right. We failed them.

91
00:06:35,885 --> 00:06:39,347
[NOZEL] We won't get any useful
information by being forceful.

92
00:06:39,431 --> 00:06:42,100
But Nero and Marie--
we have to save them!

93
00:06:42,183 --> 00:06:44,060
I agree that time
is of the essence,

94
00:06:44,144 --> 00:06:46,688
but panicking never
produces results.

95
00:06:46,771 --> 00:06:48,440
If you are a true Magic Knight,

96
00:06:48,523 --> 00:06:51,151
then you'll learn how
to keep a level head.

00:06:51,234 --> 00:06:52,694
Right.

people isn't working,

perhaps we should
try something else.

00:09:33,813 --> 00:09:37,317
That thing tracks people
who are possessed by devils!

161
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,277
How did it get here?

162
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:42,030
I can't believe they
pulled a stunt like this!

163
00:09:42,113 --> 00:09:45,658
[DAZU]
Wait, not yet. I have an idea.

164
00:09:53,667 --> 00:09:55,960
Please tell me you guys
got some good info.

165
00:09:56,044 --> 00:09:57,921
No, unfortunately,
the townspeople

166
00:09:58,004 --> 00:10:00,423
weren't being very cooperative.

167
00:10:00,507 --> 00:10:02,926
We tried to figure out where
their hideout might be,

168
00:10:03,009 --> 00:10:04,844
but no luck as of yet.

169
00:10:04,928 --> 00:10:07,222
And, despite my best efforts
to track their mana,

170
00:10:07,305 --> 00:10:09,015
we still can't
pinpoint the target.

171
00:10:09,099 --> 00:10:10,100
Look at this.

172
00:10:12,477 --> 00:10:14,896
The signal still seems
pretty unstable.

173
00:10:14,979 --> 00:10:17,023
It's also troubling that
we don't know how much time

174
00:10:17,107 --> 00:10:19,651
we have left before they
notice that magic item.

175
00:10:19,734 --> 00:10:21,444
If we don't find them
before that happens,

176
00:10:21,528 --> 00:10:22,779
things could get worse!

177
00:10:22,862 --> 00:10:24,781
Well, what'd you learn?

178
00:10:24,864 --> 00:10:27,534
We mostly just talked
to an elderly woman.

179
00:10:27,617 --> 00:10:29,744
She was an interesting person.

180
00:10:29,828 --> 00:10:31,830
[YAMI]
So, basically nothing. Got it.

181
00:10:31,913 --> 00:10:34,124
[GAUCHE] Look, I'm not
here to screw around!

182
00:10:34,207 --> 00:10:36,209
I'll do whatever it takes
to hunt down those monsters

183
00:10:36,292 --> 00:10:37,585
who took my sister.

184
00:10:37,669 --> 00:10:40,255
Once I get my hands
on them, it's over!

185
00:10:40,338 --> 00:10:42,173
What's wrong, rich boy?

186
00:10:42,257 --> 00:10:43,341
[NOZEL]
They're on the move.

187
00:10:43,425 --> 00:10:45,260
Yeah, where?

188
00:10:45,343 --> 00:10:47,303
You think they know
we're onto them?

189
00:10:47,387 --> 00:10:50,724
I dunno, but something
real weird's goin' on.

190
00:10:50,807 --> 00:10:52,392
[NOZEL]
I'm sure they realize by now

191
00:10:52,475 --> 00:10:54,686
that Magic Knights
are in the area.

192
00:10:54,769 --> 00:10:57,313
Perhaps they're creating
some type of diversion.

193
00:10:57,397 --> 00:10:58,648
All right, then I
think Gordon and I

194
00:10:58,732 --> 00:11:01,192
oughtta take another quick
look around the town.

195
00:11:01,276 --> 00:11:03,945
I'll let you guys borrow
my wheels for a while.

196
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:05,113
[NOZEL]
Thank you.

197
00:11:05,196 --> 00:11:07,365
That'll make it
easier to get back.

198
00:11:07,449 --> 00:11:10,618
[FINRAL] Even Captain Nozel's
using me as a chauffeur!

199
00:11:10,702 --> 00:11:12,454
Get on and hurry!

200
00:11:19,044 --> 00:11:20,545
[BOW]
That worked like a charm.

201
00:11:20,628 --> 00:11:23,298
Hopefully, it'll buy us
a little extra time.

202
00:11:23,381 --> 00:11:26,301
I can't believe we have
to contend with them!

203
00:11:26,384 --> 00:11:29,637
When the Eye of the Midnight
Sun ransacked our kingdom,

204
00:11:29,721 --> 00:11:32,015
many of the Magic Knights
were directly involved

205
00:11:32,098 --> 00:11:33,725
in the chaos that ensued!

206
00:11:33,808 --> 00:11:36,394
Possessed or not, they should've
been held responsible!

207
00:11:36,478 --> 00:11:38,229
[DEMON MASK 142C]
I couldn't agree with you more.

208
00:11:38,313 --> 00:11:39,731
[DEMON MASK 144A] And yet,
all they're doing right now

209
00:11:39,814 --> 00:11:42,067
is trying to protect
each other!

210
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,234
[DEMON MASK 144B]
They're a joke.

211
00:11:43,318 --> 00:11:46,529
We obviously don't
mean a thing to them!

212
00:11:46,613 --> 00:11:47,864
[DEMON MASK 142A]
It is our responsibility

213
00:11:47,947 --> 00:11:50,408
to show them what the true
meaning of justice is!

214
00:11:50,492 --> 00:11:51,868
Yes, that's right.

215
00:11:51,951 --> 00:11:53,912
We have to stand up for
the people of this kingdom,

216
00:11:53,995 --> 00:11:55,580
and make sure anyone
who threatens them

217
00:11:55,663 --> 00:11:57,749
is severely punished!

218
00:11:57,832 --> 00:12:00,794
Now. I say the first step
to exacting justice

219
00:12:00,877 --> 00:12:04,089
is to execute these two
servants of the devil!

220
00:12:04,172 --> 00:12:05,465
[ONOBY]
I agree!

221
00:12:05,548 --> 00:12:07,926
Then we can put their corpses
on display as a symbol

222
00:12:08,009 --> 00:12:10,220
of the negligence,
arrogance, and deceit

223
00:12:10,303 --> 00:12:13,640
that the Magic Knights displayed
when we needed their assistance!

224
00:12:13,723 --> 00:12:15,225
[SIONA]
They showed their true colors

225
00:12:15,308 --> 00:12:17,894
when they sided with the devil,
and now they must be stopped!

226
00:12:17,977 --> 00:12:19,104
[KABWE]
Exactly!

227
00:12:19,187 --> 00:12:21,231
From this day forward,
the Devil Banishers

228
00:12:21,314 --> 00:12:24,442
will be the ones to keep
the Clover Kingdom safe!

229
00:12:24,526 --> 00:12:28,988
Perhaps it's better if we hold
off on the executions for now.

230
00:12:29,072 --> 00:12:31,783
How can you possibly
believe that's better?

231
00:12:31,866 --> 00:12:34,577
I feel just as strongly as you.

232
00:12:34,661 --> 00:12:37,747
I can't forgive anyone who
communes with a devil.

233
00:12:37,831 --> 00:12:40,333
[DAZU] But if we hang onto
them for a little longer,

234
00:12:40,417 --> 00:12:44,170
we may be able to lure out
Asta--the boy who's possessed.

235
00:12:44,254 --> 00:12:46,548
If we killed all three
at the same time,

236
00:12:46,631 --> 00:12:50,468
we could make an even stronger
case for Master Kabwe's cause.

237
00:12:50,552 --> 00:12:52,095
[KABWE]
Hm.

238
00:12:52,178 --> 00:12:53,638
[DEMON MASK 142A]
That's a good point.

239
00:12:53,722 --> 00:12:57,017
If we use these two as bait,
the Black Bulls are sure to act.

240
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,518
[DEMON MASK 144A]
Asta's possessed.

241
00:12:58,601 --> 00:13:00,854
He's the one we really want!

242
00:13:00,937 --> 00:13:02,480
That makes sense.

243
00:13:02,564 --> 00:13:05,358
After all, he's practically
a devil himself!

244
00:13:05,442 --> 00:13:07,819
We can't hope to bring justice
to the Clover Kingdom

245
00:13:07,902 --> 00:13:10,113
until that monstrous
villain is dead!

246
00:13:10,196 --> 00:13:13,116
Yes. I'm glad you agree.

247
00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:16,995
So, now, we should determine
the best way to capture him.

248
00:13:17,078 --> 00:13:18,621
Let me think here.

249
00:13:29,758 --> 00:13:31,718
[NOZEL]
They've stopped moving.

250
00:13:31,801 --> 00:13:33,511
No one's around.

251
00:13:33,595 --> 00:13:35,513
Let's check in there.

252
00:13:35,597 --> 00:13:38,058
[GAUCHE]
Marie! We're here for you!

253
00:13:38,141 --> 00:13:40,352
Just tell me where you are!

254
00:13:50,904 --> 00:13:52,155
[NOELLE]
Well, great.

255
00:13:52,238 --> 00:13:53,865
They deceived us.

256
00:13:53,948 --> 00:13:55,283
That was the only lead we had.

257
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:57,869
How are we supposed
to find them now?

258
00:13:57,952 --> 00:13:59,954
[GAUCHE]
Damn it!

259
00:14:00,038 --> 00:14:01,623
[NOZEL]
We need a new plan.

260
00:14:01,706 --> 00:14:03,333
Let's regroup with
Yami and Gordon

261
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:05,168
and head back to the capital.

262
00:14:13,468 --> 00:14:16,054
[BOW]
We'll be all right.

263
00:14:16,137 --> 00:14:17,931
[DAZU]
You really think this'll work?

264
00:14:18,014 --> 00:14:19,474
We made it through that night,

265
00:14:19,557 --> 00:14:22,435
and our luck hasn't
run out since then.

266
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:25,897
[DAZU]
All thanks to you, Bow.

267
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,565
[BOW]
It isn't just me.

268
00:14:28,983 --> 00:14:30,694
[BOW]
If I hadn't met you.

269
00:14:30,777 --> 00:14:32,862
I wouldn't have any
purpose right now.

270
00:14:32,946 --> 00:14:36,741
I'd just be wandering
aimlessly through my life.

271
00:14:36,825 --> 00:14:39,119
[DAZU] And if not for you,
I would've felt nothing

272
00:14:39,202 --> 00:14:43,873
but despair after being left
alone to suffer in this world.

273
00:14:43,957 --> 00:14:46,251
[BOW]
You give me hope, Dazu.

274
00:14:46,334 --> 00:14:50,296
I believe in you,
with all my heart.

275
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,007
[DAZU]
If you're by my side,

276
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:54,426
I'm sure everything
will be fine.

277
00:15:06,813 --> 00:15:08,815
[ASTA grunts]

278
00:15:08,898 --> 00:15:11,401
What's goin' on? Where am I?

279
00:15:11,484 --> 00:15:13,028
[OWEN]
So, you're awake.

280
00:15:13,111 --> 00:15:15,363
This is a breakroom
inside the palace.

281
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:18,283
Is that you, Owen?

282
00:15:18,366 --> 00:15:20,744
Oh, yeah! Nero!

283
00:15:20,827 --> 00:15:22,495
Hold on! Don't leave!

284
00:15:24,205 --> 00:15:25,290
[gasps]

285
00:15:27,584 --> 00:15:29,294
Don't you think you oughtta
find out what's happenin'

286
00:15:29,377 --> 00:15:31,963
before you hightail
it out of here, kid?

287
00:15:32,047 --> 00:15:34,799
[ASTA]
I'm sorry!

288
00:15:34,883 --> 00:15:36,885
[OWEN] I was able to rid
your body of the drug,

289
00:15:36,968 --> 00:15:38,595
so you should be fine now.

290
00:15:38,678 --> 00:15:40,013
[ASTA]
Thanks a lot, doc!

291
00:15:40,096 --> 00:15:41,056
Let me get this straight.

292
00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:42,474
Nero and Marie were kidnapped

293
00:15:42,557 --> 00:15:44,517
by a group called
the Devil Panickers?

294
00:15:44,601 --> 00:15:46,603
It's Banishers, genius.

295
00:15:46,686 --> 00:15:47,937
And if things had
gone differently,

296
00:15:48,021 --> 00:15:50,273
they would've taken you, too.

297
00:15:50,357 --> 00:15:53,360
Yeah, I heard that you saved
my life in the nick of time.

298
00:15:53,443 --> 00:15:54,819
You're the best, Noelle.

299
00:15:54,903 --> 00:15:56,196
Well, it's not like I saved you

300
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:57,739
because I care about
you or anything.

301
00:15:57,822 --> 00:15:59,115
I just didn't wanna
let them get away

302
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,076
with whatever they were doing.

303
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:03,953
I wish I could've stopped
them from kidnapping Nero.

304
00:16:04,037 --> 00:16:05,872
That's not your fault, though.

305
00:16:05,955 --> 00:16:08,416
If I had just been
a little bit stronger.

306
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,751
I know it hurts,

307
00:16:09,834 --> 00:16:11,878
but there's no use in
cryin' over spilled milk.

308
00:16:11,961 --> 00:16:14,839
Now. Owen says you're
healthy enough to leave,

309
00:16:14,923 --> 00:16:17,092
so why don't you guys
head to the hideout?

310
00:16:17,175 --> 00:16:21,513
No. I'm gonna go out there
and look for those two!

311
00:16:21,596 --> 00:16:23,098
Did you not hear
anything I just said,

312
00:16:23,181 --> 00:16:25,141
or are you really that stupid?

313
00:16:25,225 --> 00:16:26,976
We don't have any clues
as to where they took them,

314
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,561
which means all you'd be
doin' is runnin' around

315
00:16:28,645 --> 00:16:29,604
on a wild goose chase!

316
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:32,273
[ASTA grunting]

317
00:16:32,357 --> 00:16:33,983
[YAMI]
Well, good luck, everybody.

318
00:16:34,067 --> 00:16:36,111
What are you gonna do,
Captain Yami?

319
00:16:36,194 --> 00:16:37,612
[YAMI]
Sometimes, a captain's gotta

320
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:41,700
tend to his business,
you know? Oh, yeah.

321
00:16:41,783 --> 00:16:44,035
I already talked to
Gauche about this,

322
00:16:44,119 --> 00:16:47,038
but if he freaks out, don't be
afraid to rough him up some.

323
00:16:47,122 --> 00:16:49,332
Try not to kill him, all right?

324
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:50,583
That sound fair?

325
00:16:50,667 --> 00:16:52,460
Yeah. I guess so.

326
00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:57,048
It looks like everyone's here.

327
00:16:57,132 --> 00:17:00,593
The Golden Dawn and Aqua Deer
are guarding the borders.

328
00:17:00,677 --> 00:17:03,013
And the Coral Peacocks
and Purple Orcas have some

329
00:17:03,096 --> 00:17:06,266
important restoration
work to attend to.

330
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:08,184
We certainly shouldn't
expect them to walk away

331
00:17:08,268 --> 00:17:11,104
from those responsibilities
right now. So, hopefully

332
00:17:11,187 --> 00:17:12,564
we'll be able to take
care of this matter

333
00:17:12,647 --> 00:17:14,816
with only the people
we have present.

334
00:17:14,899 --> 00:17:17,527
[DAMNATIO] If it's all right,
I have something to say first.

335
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:19,821
It's a distinct possibility
that my subordinates

336
00:17:19,904 --> 00:17:22,657
are the ones who orchestrated
this whole scheme.

337
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:23,992
Therefore, I'm willing
to provide you

338
00:17:24,075 --> 00:17:26,953
with any information
you require.

339
00:17:27,037 --> 00:17:29,539
[JULIUS]
Thank you for your cooperation.

340
00:17:29,622 --> 00:17:31,624
As of right now,
our top priority

341
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:34,419
should be rescuing the two
people who were kidnapped.

342
00:17:34,502 --> 00:17:35,962
We can delay the punishments.

343
00:17:36,046 --> 00:17:37,672
At the moment, it'd be
helpful if you could share

344
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:39,382
some background on your team.

345
00:17:39,466 --> 00:17:41,259
Yes, a good idea.

346
00:17:41,343 --> 00:17:43,303
Well then, Chairman Damnatio.

347
00:17:43,386 --> 00:17:45,805
Please tell us
everything you can.

348
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,435
[DAMNATIO]
This is Kabwe Carillon.

349
00:17:50,518 --> 00:17:52,062
He's 38 years of age.

350
00:17:52,145 --> 00:17:54,647
His Transparency Magic
allows him to make himself

351
00:17:54,731 --> 00:17:57,359
and the people around
him disappear.

352
00:17:57,442 --> 00:17:59,152
He can't hide his mana,

353
00:17:59,235 --> 00:18:00,570
so he doesn't have
the same skill

354
00:18:00,653 --> 00:18:03,698
as the former
Purple Orcas Captain.

355
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:06,534
Besides him, there's a man
named Onoby Sinho,

356
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:08,036
31 years old.

357
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:09,996
His Barrier Magic
creates a barricade

358
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,832
whose radius is about
five times his height.

359
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:17,003
The structure promptly explodes
if anyone tries to tear it down.

360
00:18:17,087 --> 00:18:19,089
Third, there's Siona Caverly,

361
00:18:19,172 --> 00:18:21,383
29 years old.

362
00:18:21,466 --> 00:18:24,678
Siona is a Paper Magic user,
meaning she's able to control

363
00:18:24,761 --> 00:18:27,764
any thickness or length
of paper at will.

364
00:18:27,847 --> 00:18:30,767
I could slice up
all three, easy-peasy.

365
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:33,353
We shouldn't do anything
to them until we know for sure

366
00:18:33,436 --> 00:18:35,772
that they're involved with
the Devil Banishers.

367
00:18:35,855 --> 00:18:37,649
Once there's proof,
you can slice and dice

368
00:18:37,732 --> 00:18:38,942
as much as you want.

369
00:18:39,025 --> 00:18:41,111
But for now, we need
to put our heads together

370
00:18:41,194 --> 00:18:42,654
and find those two girls.

371
00:18:42,737 --> 00:18:44,406
You got it, Beanpole?

372
00:18:44,489 --> 00:18:46,616
It's also important to note
that the Black Bull

373
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,536
happens to be a wielder
of arcane-stage magic.

374
00:18:49,619 --> 00:18:51,371
That makes her essential
to our strategy

375
00:18:51,454 --> 00:18:52,580
for defeating the devil.

376
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:55,166
We cannot afford to
lose her at any cost.

377
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,668
They're both important.

378
00:18:56,751 --> 00:18:59,295
The other girl's part
of our kingdom, as well.

379
00:18:59,379 --> 00:19:02,340
So it's imperative that we
bring her back unharmed.

380
00:19:02,424 --> 00:19:05,051
[YAMI] Hey, that was a pretty
good speech, Prickly Princess!

381
00:19:05,135 --> 00:19:08,096
You're a lot smarter than
that Stick-Bug over there.

382
00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:09,806
[JACK]
You shut it!

383
00:19:09,889 --> 00:19:11,558
[CHARLOTTE]
Yami complimented me.

384
00:19:11,641 --> 00:19:12,726
Wait, no!

385
00:19:12,809 --> 00:19:14,894
Now's not the time
to be giddy about that!

386
00:19:14,978 --> 00:19:16,896
Even if it was an ambush,
it's hard to believe

387
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:20,275
Asta was overpowered by
someone who's not a fighter.

388
00:19:20,358 --> 00:19:23,403
[YAMI] They used somethin'
he's never dealt with before.

389
00:19:23,486 --> 00:19:25,280
Apparently, the
assailants subdued him

390
00:19:25,363 --> 00:19:26,656
with a sleeping potion.

391
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,033
Are you kidding me?

392
00:19:28,116 --> 00:19:30,994
That's what I call a dirty,
underhanded trick!

393
00:19:31,077 --> 00:19:32,912
[YAMI] The kid's had
training, so he can negate

394
00:19:32,996 --> 00:19:35,165
just about any spell
someone throws at him.

395
00:19:35,248 --> 00:19:38,793
And of course he can handle
a physical attack, no problem.

396
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:41,338
Up until now, he's
basically only had to fight

397
00:19:41,421 --> 00:19:44,799
people in a way he understands,
which is face-to-face.

398
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:46,801
[NOZEL] Clearly, this
group has quite a gifted

399
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:48,678
strategist in their ranks.

400
00:19:48,762 --> 00:19:50,347
Let's not forget,
they also managed

401
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,807
to use our own magic
item against us.

402
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:54,809
If these guys are going
around calling themselves

403
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:57,437
Devil Banishers, then
it's probably safe to say

404
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,773
that they're trying to
get rid of devils, right?

405
00:19:59,856 --> 00:20:01,232
[MARX]
Yes.

406
00:20:01,316 --> 00:20:03,693
[JACK] Then why haven't they
offed their hostages yet?

407
00:20:03,777 --> 00:20:06,071
It's not like they
haven't had a chance.

408
00:20:06,154 --> 00:20:07,489
[DAMNATIO]
Provided that my subordinates

409
00:20:07,572 --> 00:20:10,158
are the responsible
party in this matter...

410
00:20:10,241 --> 00:20:11,659
Out of those three,

411
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:14,287
Kabwe is the one with the most
enduring sense of justice.

412
00:20:14,371 --> 00:20:16,664
And after the incident with
the Eye of the Midnight Sun,

413
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:19,918
his hatred of devils
became even more intense.

414
00:20:20,001 --> 00:20:22,128
In fact, Kabwe was
extremely displeased

415
00:20:22,212 --> 00:20:25,215
when the execution of the
devil-possessed was postponed.

416
00:20:25,298 --> 00:20:27,550
Then why not kill
them even quicker?

417
00:20:27,634 --> 00:20:29,302
If it were me, I would've
skipped right past

418
00:20:29,386 --> 00:20:31,596
the sleeping potions and
slaughtered them all!

419
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,848
I'm sure they had their reasons.

420
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:35,684
Stupid ones.

421
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:37,435
[DAMNATIO]
Assuming Kabwe's in charge,

422
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:39,813
I'm certain that he would
prefer a proper execution

423
00:20:39,896 --> 00:20:41,648
to murdering them on sight.

424
00:20:41,731 --> 00:20:43,525
Most likely, he will attempt
to take their lives

425
00:20:43,608 --> 00:20:46,820
in front of the
biggest audience he can.

426
00:20:46,903 --> 00:20:48,655
He hopes to gain
the public's approval,

427
00:20:48,738 --> 00:20:50,573
which will help him to
justify taking the law

428
00:20:50,657 --> 00:20:52,742
into his own hands.

429
00:20:52,826 --> 00:20:54,619
Like some kind of vigilante.

430
00:20:54,703 --> 00:20:56,913
If I know my subordinates,
this is the method

431
00:20:56,996 --> 00:20:58,873
they'll probably use.

432
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:01,501
Keh! Hell of a team
you've got there, pal.

433
00:21:01,584 --> 00:21:03,628
Fortunately, if your
assumptions are accurate,

434
00:21:03,712 --> 00:21:04,838
then it stands to reason

435
00:21:04,921 --> 00:21:07,757
that both of the hostages
are still alive.

436
00:21:07,841 --> 00:21:09,175
[YAMI]
Good.

437
00:21:09,259 --> 00:21:11,636
[CHARLOTTE] But, if there
was a public execution...

438
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,304
There would likely
be a few citizens

439
00:21:13,388 --> 00:21:15,140
who were in favor of it.

440
00:21:15,223 --> 00:21:17,851
As I've seen firsthand,
many people are resentful

441
00:21:17,934 --> 00:21:19,144
of the kingdom's
decision-making

442
00:21:19,227 --> 00:21:22,022
since the Eye of the
Midnight Sun attacked us.

443
00:21:22,105 --> 00:21:24,941
The wounds from that incident
have yet to be healed.

444
00:21:25,025 --> 00:21:27,068
That devil committed
unspeakable acts,

445
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:29,904
and our people are still
reeling from the shock of it.

446
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:31,948
If we don't correct
this quickly,

447
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,283
we might just find
ourselves dealing

448
00:21:33,366 --> 00:21:35,660
with a large-scale rebellion.

449
00:21:35,744 --> 00:21:38,830
Right now, we're preparing
to face a threat from outside.

450
00:21:38,913 --> 00:21:42,334
The last thing we need is
an additional conflict inside.

451
00:21:42,417 --> 00:21:43,752
We have to nip
this in the bud

452
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:46,421
before it becomes
uncontrollable.

453
00:21:46,504 --> 00:21:49,341
If they do decide to go through
with this public execution,

454
00:21:49,424 --> 00:21:52,677
then they won't be able
to do it without us knowing.

455
00:21:52,761 --> 00:21:55,805
Question is, what do we
do when the time comes?

456
00:21:55,889 --> 00:21:59,726
Well, I trust you'll all
proceed with caution. Yes?

457
00:21:59,809 --> 00:22:01,519
I wish I could give you
better instruction,

458
00:22:01,603 --> 00:22:03,229
but I don't know
what else to say.

459
00:22:03,313 --> 00:22:04,606
I can't help feeling
we're missing

460
00:22:04,689 --> 00:22:07,275
an important piece of
the puzzle somehow.

461
00:23:57,093 --> 00:23:58,094
[GAUCHE]
Execution?!

462
00:23:58,178 --> 00:23:59,888
There's no way I'll
let that happen!

463
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:02,390
If those psychos hurt Marie
or even make her cry,

464
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:04,684
I'll be the one executing them!

465

<i>Black Clover</i> ,
Page 145: "Rescue."

466
