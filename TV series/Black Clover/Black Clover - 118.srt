If you'd cooperated earlier

be suffering nearly as much.

it would have been impossible

It probably won't be perfect,

but it should at least
keep you alive.

If the devil's seal is broken,
then the peaceful future

But you can't, Secré.

If you use that

00:11:23,965 --> 00:11:26,634
I'll need help from

[SECRÉ]
Five hundred years ago,

00:11:32,974 --> 00:11:35,727
I was removed from
the natural realm.

134
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:38,229
I watched over the
five-leaf grimoire,

135
00:11:38,313 --> 00:11:40,148
preparing for the day
when the devil's seal

would be broken.

137
00:11:41,775 --> 00:11:44,569
And to my surprise,
the one who inherited

138
00:11:44,652 --> 00:11:49,616
that grimoire, was a boy
who was born without magic.

As soon as things
were set into motion,

eradicate his dark elf form.

Sadly, I have no use for toys

of playing with.

out of whatever it touches

00:12:53,304 --> 00:12:55,515
but I think it's the
First Wizard King!

160
00:12:55,598 --> 00:12:56,975
[gasps]

161
00:12:57,058 --> 00:12:59,853
No freakin' way!
Are you the real deal?

162
00:12:59,936 --> 00:13:01,229
I don't understand
what's goin' on here,

163
00:13:01,312 --> 00:13:02,981
but it's the coolest thing ever!

164
00:13:03,064 --> 00:13:06,317
[YUNO] Calm down, Asta.
Now isn't the time for that.

165
00:13:06,401 --> 00:13:08,028
It's you.

166
00:13:08,111 --> 00:13:09,529
Who are they?

167
00:13:09,612 --> 00:13:11,990
[SECRÉ] He's an elf revived
by forbidden magic.

168
00:13:12,073 --> 00:13:14,659
Those two are members of the
present-day Magic Knights.

169
00:13:14,743 --> 00:13:17,412
They helped gather the magic
stones to bring you back.

170
00:13:17,495 --> 00:13:18,663
[ASTA]
Hm?

171
00:13:18,747 --> 00:13:21,416
[ASTA] There's somethin'
familiar about her ki.

172
00:13:21,499 --> 00:13:24,711
[SECRÉ] Prince. We'd better
see to Licht first.

173
00:13:29,007 --> 00:13:31,259
[SECRÉ] I'm not sure of the
reason, but it looks like

174
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:33,261
that forbidden spell
reincarnated him

175
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:35,096
with his soul intact.

176
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:38,558
He's still dormant, but Licht
is in there somewhere.

177
00:13:38,641 --> 00:13:42,562
[LUMIERE]
That's good. Can you wake him?

178
00:13:42,645 --> 00:13:44,147
[SECRÉ]
Leave it to me.

179
00:13:45,231 --> 00:13:47,233
[SECREÉ] In the beginning,
my magic could only

180
00:13:47,317 --> 00:13:49,319
open and close things.

181
00:13:49,402 --> 00:13:51,571
But as His Highness
and I worked together,

182
00:13:51,654 --> 00:13:54,449
my skill gradually
started to evolve.

183
00:13:54,532 --> 00:13:56,868
He brilliantly found
ways to use my spells

184
00:13:56,951 --> 00:13:58,703
to their full potential.

185
00:13:58,787 --> 00:14:01,414
And now, thanks to
the prince's help,

186
00:14:01,498 --> 00:14:04,459
my magic can release any seal!

187
00:14:11,174 --> 00:14:12,258
Are you there?

188
00:14:12,342 --> 00:14:13,802
[LICHT gasps]

189
00:14:20,308 --> 00:14:22,936
[LICHT] There was something
I couldn't say to you back then,

190
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:28,692
so I'll say it now.
I'm grateful, Lumiere.

191
00:14:34,155 --> 00:14:36,032
It appears your
timing has improved

192
00:14:36,116 --> 00:14:38,576
in this modern era. You
must've learned your lesson

193
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,162
when you were late
all those years ago.

194
00:14:41,246 --> 00:14:45,291
And I've learned that I should
destroy both of you at once!

195
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:48,753
Licht. I...

196
00:14:48,837 --> 00:14:51,339
Patry, even though
my soul was trapped

197
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:54,300
in a deep sleep.
I saw everything.

198
00:14:54,384 --> 00:14:57,178
[PATRY]
Really? So...

199
00:14:57,262 --> 00:15:00,348
In our lifetime,
the elves fell prey

200
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:02,392
to this devil's dark plot.

201
00:15:02,475 --> 00:15:04,310
But while I was
drowning in despair,

202
00:15:04,394 --> 00:15:06,354
someone stopped me
from hurting even more

203
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:09,441
innocent people and letting
the despair grow deeper.

204
00:15:09,524 --> 00:15:12,569
My precious friend, Lumiere.

205
00:15:12,652 --> 00:15:14,946
Regardless of how it was done,

206
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:17,157
it's clear that someone
arrived to stop you

207
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,951
just in time, as well.

208
00:15:20,035 --> 00:15:22,662
Dear Patry, when you
took up that blade,

209
00:15:22,746 --> 00:15:24,330
you believed that it was right.

210
00:15:24,414 --> 00:15:26,458
But to the ones who
were struck down by it,

211
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:29,419
what you did was
an unspeakable crime.

212
00:15:30,795 --> 00:15:33,506
[LICHT] Still, even if
you can't be forgiven,

213
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:37,552
I hope this is of
some comfort to you:

214
00:15:37,635 --> 00:15:40,221
I know you did your best.

215
00:15:40,305 --> 00:15:41,723
[gasps]

216
00:15:41,806 --> 00:15:43,808
Oh, Licht.

217
00:15:45,185 --> 00:15:48,313
[LICHT] All that's left
for us to do now is combat

218
00:15:48,396 --> 00:15:50,106
this next threat without letting

219
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:52,901
our past mistakes
break our spirits.

220
00:15:52,984 --> 00:15:57,364
At long last, we'll put
an end to 500 years of pain.

221
00:15:57,447 --> 00:15:59,699
Couldn't agree more.
The sooner I swallow up

222
00:15:59,783 --> 00:16:02,619
those pitiful little feelings
of yours, the better.

223
00:16:02,702 --> 00:16:04,579
[ASTA gasps]

224
00:16:04,662 --> 00:16:08,083
[LUMIERE] Light Magic: Mana
Zone, Lamp of Avior-Gloria.

225
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:12,212
[LICHT] Sword Magic:
Origin Flash-Rampage.

226
00:16:23,973 --> 00:16:25,892
[KOTODAMA DEVIL] They managed
to blow apart my spell,

227
00:16:25,975 --> 00:16:28,436
which devours the
magic of this world.

228
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,189
The one who used the most
forbidden spell of all,

229
00:16:31,272 --> 00:16:33,274
and the one who
absorbed his power.

230
00:16:33,358 --> 00:16:35,151
The only explanation is that

231
00:16:35,235 --> 00:16:37,821
they've been affected
by that world.

232
00:16:45,662 --> 00:16:47,038
[KOTODAMA DEVIL]
They're quick!

233
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,752
Whoa. Amazing.

234
00:16:52,836 --> 00:16:54,254
[YUNO gasps]

235
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:03,388
[LUMIERE] All we have to do
is keep up this speed.

236
00:17:03,471 --> 00:17:06,349
[LICHT] If we're swift, he can't
counter with his words!

237
00:17:08,184 --> 00:17:09,477
[KOTODAMA DEVIL grunts]

238
00:17:13,481 --> 00:17:14,816
They did it!

239
00:17:14,899 --> 00:17:16,985
Douve Nuutra Edde!

240
00:17:19,946 --> 00:17:21,114
[gasps]

241
00:17:24,367 --> 00:17:25,118
His arm!

242
00:17:25,201 --> 00:17:26,536
Lumiere!

243
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:28,997
[LICHT] That spear
can break down spells!

244
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,915
I commend you for
having the wherewithal

245
00:17:30,999 --> 00:17:32,751
to attack me that many times,

246
00:17:32,834 --> 00:17:36,504
but regardless of how
capable a pair you may be,

247
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:38,548
now that I have my own
body and grimoire,

248
00:17:38,631 --> 00:17:41,343
I am unstoppable!

249
00:17:41,426 --> 00:17:43,094
[ASTA]
Wanna bet?

250
00:17:47,057 --> 00:17:48,099
[KOTODAMA DEVIL]
Anti-magic?

251
00:17:48,183 --> 00:17:49,392
--[LUMIERE gasps]
--[LICHT] Right!

252
00:17:49,476 --> 00:17:50,977
[SECRÉ]
That might do it!

253
00:17:51,061 --> 00:17:53,396
[ASTA grunting]

254
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,065
[KOTODAMA DEVIL] This weapon
is supposed to crumble

255
00:17:55,148 --> 00:17:56,566
anything it touches!

256
00:17:56,649 --> 00:18:00,278
Still, he's nothing to fear
without the other sword.

257
00:18:00,362 --> 00:18:01,613
Now, "Get back."

258
00:18:01,696 --> 00:18:03,490
[ASTA yelps]

259
00:18:03,573 --> 00:18:05,867
[KOTODAMA DEVIL]
"Tempest of Blades!"

260
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:10,914
[ASTA] All right! Thanks
for the backup, guys!

261
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:17,671
[YUNO] His magic is immense,
but it doesn't feel oppressive.

262
00:18:17,754 --> 00:18:20,423
It's almost like
a well-honed blade.

263
00:18:20,507 --> 00:18:23,718
So this is the
leader of the elves.

264
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:26,096
But, why is there something warm

265
00:18:26,179 --> 00:18:29,516
and nostalgic about
his presence?

266
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:31,768
[SECRÉ]
Let me help you!

267
00:18:31,851 --> 00:18:34,771
I'll mend the wound so
you can keep fighting!

268
00:18:34,854 --> 00:18:38,233
[SECRÉ]
Sealing Magic: Closed Sorrow!

269
00:18:39,275 --> 00:18:41,194
That's great! Thank you!

270
00:18:41,277 --> 00:18:43,071
So cool!

271
00:18:43,154 --> 00:18:46,241
Are all of his friends
as awesome as you are?

272
00:18:46,324 --> 00:18:48,284
Also, I know you're like
a jillion years old,

273
00:18:48,368 --> 00:18:50,370
but I get the feeling
I've met you before!

274
00:18:50,453 --> 00:18:52,205
Y'know. Like...

275
00:18:52,288 --> 00:18:53,915
There's somethin' about
your ki and your eyes

276
00:18:53,998 --> 00:18:56,376
that reminds me of
someone I know--

277
00:18:56,459 --> 00:18:58,628
--Just focus on the fight.
--[ASTA] Let go!

278
00:18:58,712 --> 00:19:00,672
What's the big idea?

279
00:19:00,755 --> 00:19:03,717
[laughs] You did
manage to seal me,

280
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,678
so I'll admit that ability
of yours is convenient.

281
00:19:06,761 --> 00:19:08,972
At least in terms
of this world's magic,

282
00:19:09,055 --> 00:19:10,890
which is as weak
as a wilted flower

283
00:19:10,974 --> 00:19:13,018
compared to the four-leaf kind.

284
00:19:13,101 --> 00:19:15,687
Then again, now that
I have my body,

285
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:18,356
it's completely
ineffective against me.

286
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,775
Be quiet! Long ago,

287
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:24,154
His Highness found a use
for my insignificant power!

288
00:19:24,237 --> 00:19:26,031
He showed me that
even I can help

289
00:19:26,114 --> 00:19:28,366
make this world better!

290
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:30,076
[LUMIERE]
I have a four-leaf grimoire,

291
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,202
and people always tell me

292
00:19:31,286 --> 00:19:33,496
my Light Magic is
something special.

293
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,915
But if you ask me,
everyone is unique,

294
00:19:35,999 --> 00:19:38,418
which means that we're
all pretty amazing.

295
00:19:38,501 --> 00:19:39,669
I don't know.

296
00:19:39,753 --> 00:19:41,546
All my magic can do is
open and close things,

297
00:19:41,629 --> 00:19:43,798
so I'm not that great.

298
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:45,091
What did I tell you?

299
00:19:45,175 --> 00:19:47,302
I'm sure your Sealing Magic
can come in handy

300
00:19:47,385 --> 00:19:49,471
in ways that you
haven't even discovered.

301
00:19:49,554 --> 00:19:51,264
It doesn't matter who you are.

302
00:19:51,348 --> 00:19:53,892
There are some things
that only you can do.

303
00:19:53,975 --> 00:19:56,519
Things that only I can do?

304
00:19:56,603 --> 00:19:59,105
That's why we're inventing
these magic items.

305
00:19:59,189 --> 00:20:02,692
If every person used their
talents to help everyone else,

306
00:20:02,776 --> 00:20:05,528
the world would be great!

307
00:20:05,612 --> 00:20:07,030
The only way you
know how to live

308
00:20:07,113 --> 00:20:09,282
is by taking from other people!

309
00:20:09,366 --> 00:20:11,743
But now, the ones
you hurt, stepped on,

310
00:20:11,826 --> 00:20:15,246
and brought to shame are
going to take it all back!

311
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:18,291
I suggest you get
started with that, then.

312
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:20,669
Regardless of what you do
to combat this magic,

313
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:23,588
it won't stop flowing
until you've defeated me.

314
00:20:23,672 --> 00:20:25,924
The exit is here
on the top floor.

315
00:20:26,007 --> 00:20:28,301
So the more time you
waste running your mouth,

316
00:20:28,385 --> 00:20:30,136
the more likely it is
that your friends

317
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:34,307
in the other rooms will
get swallowed up. [laughs]

318
00:20:34,391 --> 00:20:36,142
This is bad!

319
00:20:36,226 --> 00:20:38,311
[PATRY] If not even Licht
and Lumiere had the power

320
00:20:38,395 --> 00:20:40,105
to stop him, then,
is there anything

321
00:20:40,188 --> 00:20:42,273
the rest of us can do?

322
00:20:43,983 --> 00:20:45,902
[LICHT]
Very well.

323
00:20:45,985 --> 00:20:48,196
My friends and I are going
to rid this fortress

324
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:49,906
of your evil magic with a spell

325
00:20:49,989 --> 00:20:51,783
that combines all our might!

326
00:20:51,866 --> 00:20:53,868
Careful, Licht!

327
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:56,329
[LICHT]
I need to borrow your power.

328
00:20:58,415 --> 00:21:00,000
[BOTH gasp]

329
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:05,797
Crap. I probably shoulda
thought this idea

330
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,965
through a little more.

331
00:21:07,048 --> 00:21:08,842
Yes. You should have, human.

332
00:21:08,925 --> 00:21:10,969
Can't you make this
space any wider?

333
00:21:11,052 --> 00:21:13,013
Did you seriously ask me that?

334
00:21:13,096 --> 00:21:15,265
This is the thanks I get
for savin' your ass?

335
00:21:15,348 --> 00:21:16,474
You sure you're possessed?

336
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:19,436
'Cause you sound like
the real Charlotte!

337
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:22,147
Damn, this nasty stuff
is gonna chip away

338
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:24,691
at my magic until it's gone.

339
00:21:24,774 --> 00:21:26,985
If you didn't know how
to use Recovery Magic,

340
00:21:27,068 --> 00:21:30,363
we'd really be up a creek
right now, wouldn't we?

341
00:21:30,447 --> 00:21:32,490
You're welcome, brute--

342
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:35,660
Hey. Uh, what's the deal?

343
00:21:35,744 --> 00:21:36,995
Why are you glowing?

344
00:21:37,078 --> 00:21:38,496
Is that, uh, normal for elves?

345
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,540
Is this...?

346
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:45,962
That's what you get for
wasting my precious food!

347
00:21:46,046 --> 00:21:49,132
Behold the power of hunger!

348
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:03,772
It's him! Licht!

349
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:10,570
At last, we elves
get our vengeance!

350
00:22:10,653 --> 00:22:12,155
[LICHT]
Ultimate Sword Magic:

351
00:22:12,238 --> 00:22:14,866
Demon-Dweller
Sword-Conquering Eon!

352
00:22:19,662 --> 00:22:21,456
[KOTODAMA DEVIL screams]

353
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:23,291
[BOTH gasp]

354
00:22:40,308 --> 00:22:43,269
No way!

355
00:22:43,353 --> 00:22:46,356
[YUNO]
His magic's unbelievable!

356
00:22:46,439 --> 00:22:49,067
It's over.

357
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:52,028
He's dead. Well done!

358
00:22:52,112 --> 00:22:53,655
[PATRY gasps]

359
00:22:57,784 --> 00:22:59,786
[ALL gasp]

360
00:22:59,869 --> 00:23:03,665
Is that... the devil's heart?

361
00:23:03,748 --> 00:23:06,042
"Heal me."

362
00:23:10,296 --> 00:23:13,717
[KOTODAMA DEVIL cackles]
Weren't you listening?

363
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:17,012
I told you it would be
impossible to kill me.

364
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:20,390
[KOTODAMA DEVIL] Using magic
from this world, anyway.

365
00:23:22,142 --> 00:23:23,476
[PATRY] After everything
they threw at him,

366
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,730
he still regenerated? Now what?

367
00:23:28,398 --> 00:23:29,899
[ASTA]
That sword is even more deadly

368
00:23:29,983 --> 00:23:32,193
than I thought it was.

369
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:35,655
If my own sword has a power
I haven't unlocked yet,

370
00:23:35,739 --> 00:23:37,657
then we still have a chance!

371
00:23:37,741 --> 00:23:40,910
I couldn't erase that spear,
but I did block it!

372
00:23:40,994 --> 00:23:42,412
That probably means
my Anti-magic

373
00:23:42,495 --> 00:23:44,539
was too weak to break through.

374
00:23:44,622 --> 00:23:47,500
But if it kinda worked,
then it's possible, right?

375
00:23:47,584 --> 00:23:51,254
So if I can fight
as hard as them...

376
00:23:51,338 --> 00:23:53,006
...then there's something
only I can do,

377
00:23:53,089 --> 00:23:55,717
because I don't have any magic!

378
00:23:57,093 --> 00:23:59,179
[ASTA] I may not have
mana, but that's why

379
00:23:59,262 --> 00:24:01,723
I'm the one person
who can pull this off!

380
00:24:01,806 --> 00:24:03,933
Get ready, 'cause
I'm not done yet!

381
00:24:04,017 --> 00:24:07,520
<i>Black Clover</i> , Page 119:
"The Final Attack."

382
00:24:07,604 --> 00:24:08,396
Yuno!

383
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,774
Let's shut this guy up together!
