1
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:15,583
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:15,666 --> 00:00:18,333
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:24,291
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:26,958
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,500
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:39,625
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:44,083
[NARRATOR]
In order to restore Asta's arms,

8
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:46,833
which were rendered useless
after the battle with Vetto,

9
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:50,166
Noelle and Finral went to visit
a certain group of exiles.

10
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,625
We'd like to talk!

11
00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:52,791
Sure.

12
00:00:52,875 --> 00:00:54,458
I was just getting
out of the bath, so--

13
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:56,291
[NOELLE screams]

14
00:00:56,375 --> 00:00:57,750
Enough with the naked thing!

15
00:00:57,833 --> 00:01:00,500
You're a grown man.
Keep your clothes on!

16
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:02,541
[NARRATOR] A former
Diamond Kingdom commander

17
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:04,958
named Fanzell Kruger.

18
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:09,375
His fiancée, Dominante Code,
magic items artisan.

19
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:12,125
And Mariella, who was
once an assassin.

20
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:13,583
Do you have any ideas?

21
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:15,958
We have to find a way
to heal Asta's arms.

22
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:17,625
Anything will be helpful.

23
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:20,875
So, Ancient Hex Magic, huh?

24
00:01:20,958 --> 00:01:22,291
Well, there is one place.

25
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:23,416
[NOELLE, FINRAL gasp]

26
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,791
My homeland, the
Forest of Witches.

27
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:27,500
You think they'd help?

28
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:29,875
[DOMINANTE] The Queen of
the Witches' magic would.

29
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:33,916
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
in the Forest of Witches...

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,291
Hey!

31
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:37,541
The smartest witch ever
to grace the Land of Witches

32
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:39,375
has come back to say hello.

33
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:42,125
I have business here,
so open up!

34
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:21,708
[NOELLE]
Domina.

35
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:23,791
What's the Forest
of Witches like?

36
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:26,916
Well, it's sort of
an independent area.

37
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,291
It lies east of
the Clover Kingdom,

38
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,458
close to the border
of the Diamond Kingdom.

39
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:33,958
Its inhabitants are all women

40
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:37,666
skilled in specialized spells
like Hex and Spirit magic.

41
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,583
In other words, witches.

42
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:42,291
Ooh! It's women only?

43
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,250
At last, I've found my utopia!

44
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,208
[DOMINANTE] I said they're
witches, remember?

45
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:47,500
Yeah, so?

46
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:49,041
I've heard tell

47
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:51,125
men who get too close
have been turned to bugs

48
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:52,750
and drowned in toilets.

49
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:53,625
[BOTH gasp]

50
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:56,250
Hold on. If they're witches...

51
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:57,500
Oh, right!

52
00:03:57,583 --> 00:04:00,083
When Vanessa disappeared
out of nowhere,

53
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:01,875
maybe she was going
to ask their queen

54
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:04,291
to fix Asta's arms.

55
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:06,333
The thing is,
there's a strict rule

56
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:10,166
that witches must live in
the forest and nowhere else.

57
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,250
Which means that
women like Vanessa

58
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:16,250
and myself who decided to leave
are looked upon as fugitives.

59
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,166
You're fugitives?

60
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,958
[DOMINANTE] So she would
need incredible resolve

61
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:21,583
to go back there.

62
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,166
As for me, I'd fallen
head-over-heels in love

63
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,708
with my darling, so I had
no choice in the matter!

64
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:29,041
That's true, honeybear.

65
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:31,416
Both of us dove head-first
into a bottomless swamp

66
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,583
of pure devotion!

67
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,750
Oh, Zell. I love you!

68
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:37,958
And I love you, Domina!

69
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:39,041
Good grief.

70
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:41,291
They're so in love. I'm jealous!

71
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:42,958
And after I gave up
everything for you,

72
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:45,750
I'm still living in this damn
hovel, you worthless deadbeat!

73
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:46,791
[FANZELL yelps]

74
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:50,833
[DOMINANTE, FANZELL grunting]

75
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:53,083
[MARIELLA] She always aims
for his vital points.

76
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:55,333
Maybe she should've
been the assassin.

77
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:57,083
Okay.

78
00:04:57,166 --> 00:05:00,833
You know what, true
love's overrated anyway.

79
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:02,708
Now, what were
we talking about?

80
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:04,958
Right, we should get
back to business.

81
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:06,208
Yeah.

82
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:09,541
If Vanessa really did
go back to those woods,

83
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:11,791
I'm worried.

84
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,958
I don't know all of the details,

85
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:16,583
but the rumors say that Vanessa
was of special importance

86
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:18,708
to the Queen of the Witches.

87
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:20,500
One thing's for certain, though.

88
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,500
Once she goes in, it's
going to be impossible

89
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:25,208
for her to escape again.

90
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:28,291
The queen is more deadly
than you can imagine.

91
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,000
So much so that
the Diamond Kingdom

92
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:32,666
won't even try to
stand against her.

93
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,875
And there's no hope of
reasoning with her, either.

94
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:38,208
So if you're planning to
enter the Forest of Witches,

95
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:40,125
it's only right
of me to warn you.

96
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:43,208
Angering the Queen will
destroy any chance you had

97
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:45,291
of returning with your lives.

98
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:46,208
[NOELLE]
We're going.

99
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:47,458
[DOMINANTE gasps]

100
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:49,916
Whatever it takes for
us to heal Asta's arms.

101
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,416
She's right.

102
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:55,875
Domina, please tell
us where it is.

103
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:58,541
[sighs] I'm going with you.

104
00:05:58,625 --> 00:05:59,958
[FINRAL]
Huh?

105
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,625
But you just said that--

106
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,125
[FANZELL]
Count me in, too.

107
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:06,875
I'm not lettin' anyone lay
a finger on my sweet fiancée.

108
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:08,958
Asta helped me out a lot
when we first met

109
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:11,625
and showed me what I needed
to do to move forward,

110
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:13,333
so I owe him big-time.

111
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:16,666
I don't like the idea of
growing our debt, either.

112
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,041
Let's repay it.

113
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:19,833
[gasps]

114
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:22,875
Yeah. And besides all that,

115
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:24,750
I could never live
with myself if I left

116
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:27,833
my last student out to dry.

117
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:29,791
[ASTA yells]

118
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:32,583
If I can't use my arms,
I'll just work on my lower body

119
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:33,916
till it's perfect!

120
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,541
I'm not gonna stop jumping!

121
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:40,291
I want super-buff
legs like this!

122
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:45,291
[yelps] I got a cramp!

123
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:48,916
[ASTA]
Huh?

124
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,500
Long time no see, Asta.

125
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:52,166
Whoa, it's Old Man Zell!

126
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,625
[yelps]

127
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:56,000
Hold on! Where the heck
are you taking me?

128
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,833
Let's go, we can
explain on the way.

129
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:00,416
[NOELLE]
If we tell him...

130
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,625
There's no way I could
let you guys go somewhere

131
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:05,875
that dangerous for me!

132
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,916
He'll probably have
a fit, so we'll just

133
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,125
keep it a mystery for now.

134
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:12,458
Okay, we're off to
the Forest of W!

135
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:14,625
Wait, what's the W mean?

136
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:17,291
Please tell me it's
for "wonderful"!

137
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:18,625
[ASTA muffled yelp]

138
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:19,958
[ASTA muffled yelling]

139
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:20,833
Problem solved.

140
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,291
[NOELLE]
Good job, Zell!

141
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,750
Very wise, Master.

142
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:25,916
When I need to silence someone,

143
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,333
all I can think of
to do is kill them.

144
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:30,791
Uh, maybe you'd
better work on that.

145
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:33,041
We should hurry up!

146
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:39,041
[ASTA muffled] Hey! I still
don't know where we're goin'!

147
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:45,166
[WITCH 57A laughs] The other
day, there was this creepy guy

148
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,000
outside the forest,
he was staring at me

149
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:49,375
and going "ha, ha"
over and over!

150
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:52,458
Wow, seriously?
That's totally gross!

151
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:54,000
Oh, and by the way,
I'm pretty sure

152
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,458
I saw Vanessa around
here not long ago.

153
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,375
[WITCH 57B]
What? You're kidding!

154
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:01,333
If the queen finds out she's
here after what she did...

155
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:04,833
I don't even wanna think about
what's going to happen to her.

156
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:19,125
Imperfect.

157
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:21,458
And I don't just
mean you, Vanessa.

158
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:24,083
It's also true that my plans
failed to reach perfection

159
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:27,750
after you so selfishly fled
from the Forest of Witches.

160
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,416
If you had mastered
