00:00:22,512 --> 00:00:24,097
[NARRATOR]
The Clover Kingdom.

2
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,599
In this place where
magic is everything,

3
00:00:26,683 --> 00:00:29,519
there lives one boy
who was born without it.

4
00:00:29,602 --> 00:00:31,646
His name is Asta.

5
00:00:33,398 --> 00:00:34,733
[NARRATOR]
His strength and determination

6
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:37,068
helped him become
a Magic Knight.

7
00:00:37,152 --> 00:00:39,779
And despite the many
challenges he faces,

8
00:00:39,863 --> 00:00:43,533
he aims for the top
and refuses to give up!

9
00:00:43,616 --> 00:00:45,243
Rich or poor,

10
00:00:45,326 --> 00:00:47,370
royalty or commoner,

11
00:00:47,454 --> 00:00:50,248
Asta believes anyone can shine.

12
00:00:50,331 --> 00:00:53,293
His mission is to prove
that to the whole world

13
00:00:53,376 --> 00:00:56,212
and to become the
next Wizard King!

14
00:01:02,385 --> 00:01:04,095
[ZARA]
Those flowers are for me?

15
00:01:04,179 --> 00:01:06,639
Yes. I hope you like them.

16
00:01:06,723 --> 00:01:08,433
Don't just give them away!

17
00:01:08,516 --> 00:01:09,642
[MAN A]
It's fine.

18
00:01:09,726 --> 00:01:12,312
You're my hero, so I
want to give you a gift!

19
00:01:12,395 --> 00:01:14,647
[ZORA]
Dad?

20
00:01:14,731 --> 00:01:15,690
[ZARA]
Zora!

21
00:01:15,774 --> 00:01:18,401
Come over here for a sec.

22
00:01:18,485 --> 00:01:20,570
I should be on my way now.

23
00:01:24,616 --> 00:01:25,909
What happened?

24
00:01:25,992 --> 00:01:28,161
They smell really nice,
don't you think?

25
00:01:28,244 --> 00:01:32,248
I've always been partial
to this fragrance.

26
00:01:32,332 --> 00:01:33,750
Yeah, I know.

27
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:36,795
[ZARA laughs]

28
00:03:08,261 --> 00:03:09,262
[ZORA]
Yeah.

29
00:03:09,346 --> 00:03:11,765
Like I have time
for crap like that.

30
00:03:11,848 --> 00:03:14,267
Hah! I don't need
to train with them.

31
00:03:14,351 --> 00:03:15,643
I didn't join the Black Bulls

32
00:03:15,727 --> 00:03:18,271
to make new friends
and play around.

33
00:03:21,858 --> 00:03:24,235
[ZORA] Taking a little solo
trip to get some practice in

34
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,446
was obviously the best choice.

35
00:03:26,529 --> 00:03:29,282
They'd probably slow me down.

36
00:03:29,366 --> 00:03:33,244
But at some point, I guess
I should change my ways.

37
00:03:35,914 --> 00:03:38,208
[ZORA]
Right, Dad?

38
00:03:45,131 --> 00:03:49,427
[ZORA] I doubt anyone from
back home left these here.

39
00:03:49,511 --> 00:03:52,639
Since Dad was the first commoner
to become a Magic Knight,

40
00:03:52,722 --> 00:03:55,517
people used to call him
the pride of Tolsa Village.

41
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:08,988

[ZORA]
He did that with no grimoire?

48
00:04:30,719 --> 00:04:33,430
This kid's got potential.

49
00:04:33,513 --> 00:04:35,306

[KAITO]
Oops, look at that.

00:04:44,691 --> 00:04:47,444
Wow, Kaito, that Flame Magic
of yours is really incredible.

55
00:04:47,527 --> 00:04:49,154
I can't believe you
managed to hit the target

from all the way over there!

00:04:50,697 --> 00:04:52,073
Yeah, I can't wait
for you to take

00:04:52,157 --> 00:04:54,117
the Magic Knights Entrance Exam!

59
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,786
Now isn't the time for flattery.

60
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:59,706
[ZORA] A rich kid?
All the way out here?

61
00:04:59,789 --> 00:05:03,001
Family must be getting
away for the summer.

What's wrong? You look mad.

00:05:05,545 --> 00:05:06,588
Say sorry!

00:05:06,671 --> 00:05:08,965
Did you just tell
Kaito to apologize?

[TEEN 138B]
You better watch your mouth!

[KAITO]
Relax.

67
00:05:12,385 --> 00:05:14,596
He's just a baby who doesn't
have his grimoire yet,

68
00:05:14,679 --> 00:05:17,140
and he's a commoner,

[KAITO, TEENS]
Hm?

74
00:05:27,859 --> 00:05:31,613
But when I turn 15 and I
get my own grimoire...

75
00:05:31,696 --> 00:05:32,906
[KAITO]
Don't tell me:

76
00:05:32,989 --> 00:05:34,616
you think you're going
to become a Magic Knight.

77

[INA]
Exactly!

In fact, I know I will!

79
00:05:37,202 --> 00:05:39,621
[KAITO] Sorry, but I think
you'll find that's impossible

80
00:05:39,704 --> 00:05:40,789
for the lower class.

81
00:05:40,872 --> 00:05:42,040
You're wrong!

82
00:05:42,123 --> 00:05:44,709
It wouldn't be the first
time a peasant did that!

83
00:05:44,793 --> 00:05:45,960
Is that true?

84
00:05:46,044 --> 00:05:48,963
Oh, yes, and they've
made quite a splash.

85
00:05:49,047 --> 00:05:51,174
Then I guess there had to have
been some special reason

86
00:05:51,257 --> 00:05:52,425
why they were accepted.

87
00:05:52,509 --> 00:05:54,469
They probably had dirt
on somebody important.

88

didn't get in that way!

that all those terrible

because of some huge scandal?

00:08:55,567 --> 00:08:57,068
and then I could
give him more time

162
00:08:57,152 --> 00:08:59,696
to improve his
skills with magic.

163
00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:02,991
You see? I'm an awful father.

164
00:09:05,618 --> 00:09:08,413
[INA]
Hey! Let go of me!

165
00:09:08,496 --> 00:09:10,081
[INA'S DAD]
Where are you going?

166
00:09:12,667 --> 00:09:17,339
That young man...
He's kind of familiar.

167
00:09:17,422 --> 00:09:20,925
[INA grunts]
You can't just carry me off!

168
00:09:21,009 --> 00:09:22,177
[ZORA]
Awesome Mask Guy.

169
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,053
[INA]
Huh?

170
00:09:23,136 --> 00:09:24,429
Call me that.

171
00:09:24,512 --> 00:09:26,681
What? Don't tell me what to do!

172
00:09:26,765 --> 00:09:30,185
[ZORA] And I'll call you shrimp.
No, snot-nosed shrimp.

173
00:09:30,268 --> 00:09:32,687
I'm not a snot-nosed shrimp!

174
00:09:32,771 --> 00:09:35,023
[ZORA] Back to what
we were talkin' about.

175
00:09:35,106 --> 00:09:38,151
It's true, Zara was
a great Magic Knight

176
00:09:38,234 --> 00:09:39,861
who happened to be a peasant.

177
00:09:39,944 --> 00:09:41,071
[INA]
Yeah, and?

178
00:09:41,154 --> 00:09:44,157
He must've had something
I don't have, right?

179
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,617
[ZORA]
That's not what I'm saying.

180
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,828
Zara never complained about
growin' up the way he did.

181
00:09:48,912 --> 00:09:51,122
As a matter of fact,
I don't remember him

182
00:09:51,206 --> 00:09:52,957
ever saying a harsh
word about anybody.

183
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:55,126
Wait a sec, Mask Guy!
You knew him?

184
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:57,629
[ZORA]
<i>Awesome</i> Mask Guy, kid.

185
00:09:57,712 --> 00:10:00,340
Heh. And yeah, I knew him,
but you're right,

186
00:10:00,423 --> 00:10:03,635
there were a lot of things about
him that were nothing like you.

187
00:10:06,554 --> 00:10:08,306
It's fine, okay?

188
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:10,767
I know that I'm aiming too high.

189
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,727
[ZORA gasps]

190
00:10:12,811 --> 00:10:14,020
[ZARA]
Aiming too high?

191
00:10:14,104 --> 00:10:15,313
That's what I said.

192
00:10:15,397 --> 00:10:16,940
You're a commoner,
there's no way

193
00:10:17,023 --> 00:10:19,359
you could be one of
the Magic Knights.

194
00:10:19,442 --> 00:10:21,945
Well, I may have failed the
Magic Knights Entrance Exam

195
00:10:22,028 --> 00:10:24,239
more times than I can remember,

196
00:10:24,322 --> 00:10:25,824
but I don't think
I've set my sights

197
00:10:25,907 --> 00:10:27,575
on something that's
unachievable.

198
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:28,493
[ZORA]
Huh?

199
00:10:28,576 --> 00:10:30,036
Zora.

200
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,997
I'm always telling you I'll join
the Magic Knights, aren't I?

201
00:10:33,081 --> 00:10:35,792
Well, son, that's because
I honestly believe

202
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:37,919
that it'll happen one day!

203
00:10:38,003 --> 00:10:41,089
[ZORA laughs]

204
00:10:42,716 --> 00:10:43,800
[ZORA]
You told those brats

205
00:10:43,883 --> 00:10:45,844
you'd get into
the Magic Knights.

206
00:10:45,927 --> 00:10:46,970
[INA]
So you heard.

207
00:10:47,053 --> 00:10:48,513
What, is that a problem?

208
00:10:48,596 --> 00:10:51,057
[ZORA]
Nah, I don't care what you do.

209
00:10:51,141 --> 00:10:53,768
My thing is, if you're able
to say something like that

210
00:10:53,852 --> 00:10:55,603
with a straight face,
it must mean

211
00:10:55,687 --> 00:10:56,896
you really think you can do it.

212
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,732
[gasps]

213
00:10:58,815 --> 00:11:02,652
[ZORA] And if that's the case,
then you're not aiming too high.

214
00:11:02,736 --> 00:11:05,947
Zara used to talk
like that, too.

215
00:11:06,031 --> 00:11:10,035
Maybe I really do believe
that it'll happen.

216
00:11:10,118 --> 00:11:13,079
[ZORA] Let me give you a bit
of advice, snot-nosed shrimp.

217
00:11:13,163 --> 00:11:16,583
I said to stop calling me that!

218
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:18,335
What the heck?

219
00:11:18,418 --> 00:11:20,837
Is that doll
supposed to be you?

220
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,756
This guy is Zora the Supermage,

221
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:24,716
the mysterious
herald of justice.

222
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,468
I'm not a toddler.

223
00:11:26,551 --> 00:11:29,554
He may talk a lot of smack,
but he's a good man.

224
00:11:29,637 --> 00:11:31,890
He fights evil from the shadows!

225
00:11:31,973 --> 00:11:33,767
[INA]
What a lame backstory!

226
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,727
And are you
seriously into dolls?

227
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:37,145
How old are you?

228
00:11:37,228 --> 00:11:40,023
Zora was the son of a
peasant, just like you are,

229
00:11:40,106 --> 00:11:42,984
but he was never impressed
by nobles or royalty.

230
00:11:43,068 --> 00:11:44,819
Because, deep down,
he knew there was something

231
00:11:44,903 --> 00:11:46,863
he could do that they couldn't.

232
00:11:46,946 --> 00:11:49,240
Stop ignoring me!

233
00:11:49,324 --> 00:11:50,742
Wait, did you say Zora

234
00:11:50,825 --> 00:11:53,078
had something the
rich people didn't?

235
00:11:53,161 --> 00:11:54,204
[ZORA]
Hm...

236
00:11:54,287 --> 00:11:55,830
Now, I wonder what
that could be.

237
00:11:55,914 --> 00:11:57,248
[INA]
How the hell would I know?

238
00:11:57,332 --> 00:11:58,958
[ZORA]
Guess you don't.

239
00:11:59,042 --> 00:12:02,462
But if you wanna be
a Magic Knight one day,

240
00:12:02,545 --> 00:12:05,090
then you better figure it out.

241
00:12:24,192 --> 00:12:26,653
[sighs]

242
00:12:26,736 --> 00:12:29,572
[ZORA] Zora was the son of
a peasant, just like you are,

243
00:12:29,656 --> 00:12:32,450
but he was never impressed
by nobles or royalty.

244
00:12:32,534 --> 00:12:34,369
Because, deep down,
he knew there was something

245
00:12:34,452 --> 00:12:36,371
he could do that they couldn't.

246
00:12:36,454 --> 00:12:38,289
I wonder what that could be.

247
00:12:38,373 --> 00:12:41,167
[INA'S DAD]
Let's take a lunch break.

248
00:12:41,251 --> 00:12:43,712
I can handle this
afternoon's workload,

249
00:12:43,795 --> 00:12:47,215
so feel free to go practice
your magic if you want.

250
00:12:47,298 --> 00:12:48,967
[INA grunts]

251
00:12:56,391 --> 00:12:59,185
[splashing]

252
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,736
[KAITO]
So, we meet again.

253
00:13:07,819 --> 00:13:11,448
I graciously let you
off the hook yesterday.

254
00:13:11,531 --> 00:13:14,200
But now, you'll pay
for what you did.

255
00:13:14,284 --> 00:13:17,412
Look, commoner. Ever seen
one of these before?

256
00:13:19,581 --> 00:13:20,999
[ZORA]
No way!

257
00:13:21,082 --> 00:13:22,917
Now that I have this...

258
00:13:24,002 --> 00:13:25,045
[ZORA]
Idiot.

259
00:13:25,128 --> 00:13:27,589
Kids shouldn't mess
with magic items.

260
00:13:27,672 --> 00:13:29,215
[KAITO]
I just want an apology.

261
00:13:29,299 --> 00:13:30,592
Is that so difficult?

262
00:13:30,675 --> 00:13:32,886
Now, get down on your
knees and grovel.

263
00:13:32,969 --> 00:13:34,137
I didn't do anything!

264
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,055
All right.

265
00:13:35,138 --> 00:13:36,890
One more chance, then.

266
00:13:36,973 --> 00:13:40,101
Apologize to me or
suffer the consequences!

267
00:13:40,185 --> 00:13:42,645
[yelps]

268
00:13:42,729 --> 00:13:44,397
[ZORA gasps]
Dumbass!

269
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,494
[KAITO screams]

270
00:13:59,662 --> 00:14:01,164
That's strike two.

271
00:14:01,247 --> 00:14:04,000
Go play with somethin'
more your speed.

272
00:14:08,129 --> 00:14:09,923
You're really powerful, huh?

273
00:14:10,006 --> 00:14:12,967
Almost like... a Magic Knight.

274
00:14:13,051 --> 00:14:14,719
[ZORA]
Eh, maybe.

275
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,532
Ina--

276
00:14:38,243 --> 00:14:42,163
[KAITO'S DAD]
There you are, you little thief.

277
00:14:42,247 --> 00:14:44,040
Can I help you, sir?

278
00:14:46,876 --> 00:14:49,963
Hey, what are you
doing to my son?

279
00:14:50,046 --> 00:14:51,131
[KAITO'S DAD]
See this?

280
00:14:51,214 --> 00:14:53,508
[INA'S DAD]
Isn't that a magic item?

281
00:14:53,591 --> 00:14:54,759
[KAITO'S DAD]
Your little delinquent

282
00:14:54,843 --> 00:14:57,262
snuck into my private
villa and purloined it!

283
00:14:57,345 --> 00:14:59,973
What? No!

284
00:15:00,056 --> 00:15:01,558
Don't lie to me, boy!

285
00:15:01,641 --> 00:15:03,560
If you didn't steal it,
then what's it doing

286
00:15:03,643 --> 00:15:05,020
in this pathetic hovel?

287
00:15:05,103 --> 00:15:08,189
Look! Your son's obviously
the one who stole it!

288
00:15:08,273 --> 00:15:12,277
I just picked it up after
he dropped it on the ground!

289
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,155
Tell me, Kaito. Is that true?

290
00:15:15,238 --> 00:15:17,157
Don't let yourself be fooled.

291
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,324
He's a lowly peasant,

292
00:15:18,408 --> 00:15:20,827
and everyone knows
they can't be trusted.

293
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:23,580
You were the one who first
taught me that, Father.

294
00:15:23,663 --> 00:15:25,081
I certainly did!

295
00:15:25,165 --> 00:15:27,542
Now. I'm taking you
to the royal capital

296
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,961
so that you can be
arrested for your crimes!

297
00:15:30,045 --> 00:15:31,129
No!

298
00:15:31,212 --> 00:15:32,339
[INA]
Let me go!

299
00:15:32,422 --> 00:15:34,966
I told you, I'm not a thief!

300
00:15:37,552 --> 00:15:40,472
[INA'S DAD]
Let go of him, right now!

301
00:15:40,555 --> 00:15:42,474
[KAITO'S DAD]
And what if I refuse?

302
00:15:42,557 --> 00:15:45,393
[INA'S DAD] If my son says he's
innocent, then I believe him.

303
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:48,021
I won't let you
take him anywhere!

304
00:15:48,104 --> 00:15:49,564
Thanks, Dad.

305
00:15:52,734 --> 00:15:55,111
You filthy lowlife.

306
00:15:55,195 --> 00:15:57,113
You will do as I say!

307
00:15:57,197 --> 00:15:58,615
Dad, no!

308
00:16:00,825 --> 00:16:02,619
[INA'S DAD yells]

309
00:16:02,702 --> 00:16:03,578
What?

310
00:16:03,661 --> 00:16:05,038
[KAITO, INA gasp]

311
00:16:06,623 --> 00:16:07,874
Did the flowers burn?

312
00:16:07,957 --> 00:16:09,668
They'll be all right.

313
00:16:14,923 --> 00:16:16,216
[KAITO'S DAD]
I wouldn't have to hurt you

314
00:16:16,299 --> 00:16:19,177
if you'd just
understand your place!

315
00:16:23,973 --> 00:16:26,810
[INA'S DAD yells]

316
00:16:31,314 --> 00:16:33,441
That was awesome!

317
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:36,403
[KAITO'S DAD] Wipe that smug
look off your face, you scum!

318
00:16:36,486 --> 00:16:38,822
Fine, if you still
believe your son's word,

319
00:16:38,905 --> 00:16:42,158
in spite of the undeniable
evidence, then I'll have to let

320
00:16:42,242 --> 00:16:44,536
the Magic Knights take out
the trash instead!

321
00:16:44,619 --> 00:16:48,873
[ZORA] If you've got "undeniable
evidence," let me see it.

322
00:16:48,957 --> 00:16:51,751
[KAITO'S DAD]
What? Who the hell are you?

323
00:16:54,045 --> 00:16:56,172
[KAITO'S DAD]
I know that robe.

324
00:16:56,256 --> 00:16:57,966
You're a Black Bull!

325
00:16:58,049 --> 00:17:00,552
[INA]
I knew he was a Magic Knight!

326
00:17:00,635 --> 00:17:02,429
[KAITO'S DAD]
I'm happy you're here, sir!

327
00:17:02,512 --> 00:17:05,056
Dispose of these
criminals, posthaste!

328
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,517
I'm gonna need to check
out that evidence first.

329
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,394
[KAITO'S DAD]
Ah, yes, of course!

330
00:17:09,477 --> 00:17:12,772
Tell him how you saw this boy
steal with your own eyes, Kaito!

331
00:17:12,856 --> 00:17:15,025
Um, well, I...

332
00:17:15,108 --> 00:17:16,985
[ZORA]
That's a funny coincidence,

333
00:17:17,068 --> 00:17:18,570
'cause I happened
to see your son

334
00:17:18,653 --> 00:17:20,780
terrorizing this other kid
with a magic item

335
00:17:20,864 --> 00:17:22,407
in the woods earlier.

336
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:23,950
After I stepped in
to break it up,

337
00:17:24,034 --> 00:17:28,371
he ran off like a wounded puppy
and left it lying in the dirt.

338
00:17:28,455 --> 00:17:30,415
Let me guess,
your old man figured out

339
00:17:30,498 --> 00:17:32,751
that the magic item
had gone missing,

340
00:17:32,834 --> 00:17:34,711
and then you decided you
would save your own hide

341
00:17:34,794 --> 00:17:37,672
and try to pin the blame on
the snot-nosed shrimp instead.

342
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:39,424
You're the real thief here.

343
00:17:39,507 --> 00:17:40,759
It's interesting, they say lying

344
00:17:40,842 --> 00:17:42,302
paves the way to stealing,
but it looks like

345
00:17:42,385 --> 00:17:45,055
you went and did it
backwards, eh, fancypants?

346
00:17:45,138 --> 00:17:47,724
You're trash and
so is your father.

347
00:17:47,807 --> 00:17:50,769
Is any of this true? Tell me!

348
00:17:50,852 --> 00:17:52,645
[ZORA]
Your proof's right here.

349
00:17:52,729 --> 00:17:55,231
[gasps] Explain yourself, Kaito!

350
00:17:55,315 --> 00:17:57,525
[ZORA]
You took it, didn't you, kid?

351
00:17:57,609 --> 00:18:00,278
It was me! I'm so sorry!

352
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:03,615
Don't run away!

353
00:18:03,698 --> 00:18:06,159
I'll overlook what you did,
just this one time!

354
00:18:06,242 --> 00:18:08,953
"Overlook," my ass.

355
00:18:09,037 --> 00:18:11,331
[ZORA]
Like father, like son, right?

356
00:18:11,414 --> 00:18:15,794
Never seen a better example
of that than you lousy snobs.

357
00:18:15,877 --> 00:18:17,671
You know, even if
I liked nobility,

358
00:18:17,754 --> 00:18:19,839
which I absolutely don't,
I would still say

359
00:18:19,923 --> 00:18:22,592
you have no business
raising a child.

360
00:18:22,676 --> 00:18:25,261
You're a shit dad,
and you know it.

361
00:18:26,513 --> 00:18:29,724
[ZORA] You don't deserve
a magic item like this.

362
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:32,477
Now get outta here,
or you're dead!

363
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,854
[yelps] Yes, sir!

364
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,357
How 'bout that?

365
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,735
Their screams even
sound the same.

366
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:42,529
[INA]
Dad.

367
00:18:42,612 --> 00:18:43,655
That spell.

368
00:18:43,738 --> 00:18:47,742
I never knew your magic
was so powerful.

369
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:50,036
[INA'S DAD] I'm ashamed to
admit this, but I've failed

370
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,373
the Magic Knights Entrance
Exam numerous times.

371
00:18:53,456 --> 00:18:54,958
You see my leg?

372
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:59,587
I injured it during one
of those many failures.

373
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:02,716
But no matter what,
I refuse to give up trying.

374
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,509
Even when I'm working
with the flowers,

375
00:19:04,592 --> 00:19:08,430
I'm constantly
practicing spells.

376
00:19:08,513 --> 00:19:13,018
I want to follow in
my hero's footsteps.

377
00:19:13,101 --> 00:19:14,936
He failed several times, too,

378
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,313
but eventually, he became
a Magic Knight.

379
00:19:17,397 --> 00:19:20,734
I know he must've given
it everything he had.

380
00:19:20,817 --> 00:19:23,653
Zora was the son of a
peasant, just like you are,

381
00:19:23,737 --> 00:19:26,406
but he was never impressed
by nobles or royalty.

382
00:19:26,489 --> 00:19:28,366
Because, deep down,
he knew there was something

383
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:30,410
he could do that
they couldn't do.

384
00:19:30,493 --> 00:19:33,246
Now, I wonder what
that could be?

385
00:19:33,329 --> 00:19:36,124
[INA] I think I figured
it out, Awesome Mask Guy.

386
00:19:36,207 --> 00:19:38,126
That can <i>not</i> be his name.

387
00:19:38,209 --> 00:19:41,129
What Zora could do
that they can't.

388
00:19:41,212 --> 00:19:42,339
[ZORA]
Good.

389
00:19:42,422 --> 00:19:43,548
Then you probably know
what you need to say

390
00:19:43,631 --> 00:19:46,384
to your old man now, right?

391
00:19:46,468 --> 00:19:49,763
I'm sorry, Dad, for what I said.

392
00:19:49,846 --> 00:19:51,473
Son.

393
00:19:51,556 --> 00:19:55,685
[INA] I believe you can become
a Magic Knight one day!

394
00:19:55,769 --> 00:19:56,895
[INA'S DAD]
Well, it won't be just me.

395
00:19:56,978 --> 00:19:58,063
Huh?

396
00:19:58,146 --> 00:20:00,982
[INA'S DAD]
We can work at it together!

397
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:03,109
[INA]
Yeah!

398
00:20:06,488 --> 00:20:09,574
[INA]
Thanks a lot. One thing, though.

399
00:20:09,657 --> 00:20:11,493
Why did you bother?

400
00:20:11,576 --> 00:20:13,495
[ZORA]
Eh, no special reason.

401
00:20:13,578 --> 00:20:15,163
Okay.

402
00:20:17,832 --> 00:20:20,794
[INA] You really are a
Supermage, aren't you?

403
00:20:20,877 --> 00:20:21,795
What?

404
00:20:21,878 --> 00:20:23,588
I saw your Black Bulls robe.

405
00:20:23,672 --> 00:20:25,507
You're part of their squad!

406
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:28,093
[ZORA] I wouldn't say
I'm a Supermage.

407
00:20:28,176 --> 00:20:29,427
Huh?

00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:34,683
Right!

411
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:35,934
Well, someday,

412
00:20:36,017 --> 00:20:38,186
I'll be part of a squad, too!

413
00:20:38,269 --> 00:20:41,439
I wish you all the best,
snot-nosed shrimp.

414
00:20:41,523 --> 00:20:42,691
Thanks!

415

No way! I am!

419
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:05,213
[ZORA] The only reason those two
can say that all the time

420
00:21:05,296 --> 00:21:10,260
is because they truly
believe they can do it.

421
00:21:10,343 --> 00:21:12,512
You just wait and see, Dad.

422
00:21:12,595 --> 00:21:13,888
I'll make it to that zero stage

423
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:17,434
everybody's been
talking about lately.

424
00:21:17,517 --> 00:21:21,479
And I'll start by whippin'
my sorry squadmates into shape.

425
00:21:21,563 --> 00:21:24,315
Seriously, where would
they be without me?

Come on, Dad, you do
know I'm 12, right?

Yeah, and now I'm a whopping 25!

432

No, that was my dad,
