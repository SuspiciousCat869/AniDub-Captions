1
00:00:23,763 --> 00:00:25,557
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,601
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:32,105 --> 00:00:34,441
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:34,524 --> 00:00:37,027
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:43,533 --> 00:00:45,535
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:45,618 --> 00:00:49,706
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:02:21,047 --> 00:02:22,215
[FINRAL]
What? But you--

8
00:02:22,298 --> 00:02:24,592
I mean-- You're a-- How?

9
00:02:24,676 --> 00:02:25,969
Why? Wh-What? I'm so confused!

10
00:02:26,052 --> 00:02:27,262
--[NERO] Did you not hear me?
--What's happening?

11
00:02:27,345 --> 00:02:29,139
[FINRAL] Nero's a bird,
and birds don't talk,

12
00:02:29,222 --> 00:02:31,391
so how the heck are you
talking to me right now?

13
00:02:31,474 --> 00:02:32,892
[MAGIC KNIGHT 116A]
The bird just spoke!

14
00:02:32,976 --> 00:02:35,729
[MAGIC KNIGHT 116B] It must
be a spirit! A noble spirit!

15
00:02:35,812 --> 00:02:37,731
Nero! What's going on here?

16
00:02:37,814 --> 00:02:39,566
Since when have
you been a talker?

17
00:02:39,649 --> 00:02:42,360
Wait, I know! I'm
still asleep, aren't I?

18
00:02:42,444 --> 00:02:44,696
Kindly pick your jaw
up off the ground.

19
00:02:44,779 --> 00:02:46,322
I need a portal, at once!

20
00:02:46,406 --> 00:02:48,283
[FINRAL]
Not only is the bird talking:

21
00:02:48,366 --> 00:02:51,494
now it's giving me orders, too?!

22
00:02:51,578 --> 00:02:54,122
[NERO] As it stands, the humans
who are still possessed

23
00:02:54,205 --> 00:02:56,207
by elves may not be
able to change back.

24
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:57,042
[FINRAL]
Huh?

25
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:59,502
That's not the worst part.

26
00:02:59,586 --> 00:03:01,254
Anyway, I need you to escort me

27
00:03:01,338 --> 00:03:03,381
to the demon's
bones, immediately!

28
00:03:03,465 --> 00:03:06,217
Wow. Weird day.

29
00:03:16,603 --> 00:03:18,646
Now, "Return."

30
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:24,861
[KOTODAMA DEVIL cackles]
One good cut deserves another.

31
00:03:24,944 --> 00:03:27,364
"Tempest of Blades."

32
00:03:28,531 --> 00:03:31,117
[YAMI] You ever heard
of a fair fight, pal?

33
00:03:33,119 --> 00:03:36,122
[YAMI] This devil's
got some dirty tricks.

34
00:03:36,206 --> 00:03:37,374
[KOTODAMA DEVIL]
"Earth Shield."

35
00:03:37,457 --> 00:03:38,792
[YAMI] Not only can he
make anything he says

36
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:42,253
manifest as magic,
he can summon objects,

37
00:03:42,337 --> 00:03:47,217
move 'em, and manipulate 'em
however he sees fit.

38
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,427
That "Tempest of Blades"
technique is pretty much

39
00:03:49,511 --> 00:03:54,224
all those things at once.
This is ridiculous!

40
00:03:54,307 --> 00:03:57,185
He withered Charlotte's
briars, healed himself,

41
00:03:57,268 --> 00:04:00,605
and messes with us in every
other way he can think of.

42
00:04:02,065 --> 00:04:04,901
[YAMI] But since he hasn't
straight-up ordered us to die,

43
00:04:04,984 --> 00:04:07,946
that must mean he
has some limitations.

44
00:04:08,029 --> 00:04:11,991
Dammit. This is such
a pain in the ass.

45
00:04:12,075 --> 00:04:13,243
[YAMI]
Charlotte!

46
00:04:13,326 --> 00:04:15,078
It's Charla!

47
00:04:19,124 --> 00:04:20,291
[CHARLOTTE]
Earlier...

48
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:22,002
"Wither, vines"!

49
00:04:22,085 --> 00:04:25,213
[CHARLOTTE] Not all of my briars
were affected by his attack.

50
00:04:25,296 --> 00:04:27,674
Perhaps they were out of range?

51
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,805
[CHARLOTTE] His magic capacity
might've been a factor, as well.

52
00:04:33,888 --> 00:04:35,932
Could it be that he's putting
such a massive amount

53
00:04:36,016 --> 00:04:38,810
of magic power into his
words that our own spells

54
00:04:38,893 --> 00:04:40,687
are being overwhelmed?

55
00:04:45,442 --> 00:04:47,569
[YAMI] All we can do is weather
his attacks while we try

56
00:04:47,652 --> 00:04:50,321
to figure out what
his weakness is!

57
00:04:53,158 --> 00:04:55,201
[YAMI]
I did notice one thing, though.

58
00:04:55,285 --> 00:04:56,369
No matter what he says,

59
00:04:56,453 --> 00:04:59,748
his words can't block
my Dark Magic.

60
00:04:59,831 --> 00:05:02,042
Yep, he jumped outta the way.

61
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:04,711
Now I just gotta land
a good hit on him.

62
00:05:12,969 --> 00:05:15,305
Not too bad!

63
00:05:15,388 --> 00:05:18,475
[KOTODAMA DEVIL cackles]
For someone who's essentially

64
00:05:18,558 --> 00:05:22,312
still asleep, you seem to be
moving around quite a bit.

65
00:05:22,395 --> 00:05:23,480
[CHARLOTTE]
He's right.

66
00:05:23,563 --> 00:05:25,648
Licht can't use
his full power yet.

67
00:05:25,732 --> 00:05:29,152
For now, the fight appears
balanced, but soon...!

68
00:05:29,235 --> 00:05:31,654
[KOTODAMA DEVIL]
"Tempest of Blades."

69
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:38,411
[YAMI] There's no end
to these damn things!

70
00:05:38,495 --> 00:05:42,207
Man, this freak is even
stronger than I thought.

71
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:46,795
In terms of raw power,
he's got us all beat.

72
00:05:46,878 --> 00:05:49,589
I can't keep my
magic goin' forever.

73
00:05:49,673 --> 00:05:52,884
And he looks like he
hasn't even broken a sweat.

74
00:05:54,761 --> 00:05:58,473
[KOTODAMA DEVIL cackles]
I'm enjoying your company.

75
00:05:58,556 --> 00:06:01,309
It's good to have
something to keep me busy.

76
00:06:01,393 --> 00:06:03,603
Inhabiting my own body
and playing freely

77
00:06:03,687 --> 00:06:05,230
with my magic spells
is enough to make

78
00:06:05,313 --> 00:06:07,273
my heart dance with happiness!

79
00:06:07,357 --> 00:06:08,900
I'm very grateful to you.

80
00:06:08,983 --> 00:06:10,527
And, of course,
you've helped me obtain

81
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,862
the five-leaf grimoire.
Let's try it!

82
00:06:12,946 --> 00:06:16,324
I'll show you what devils
are truly capable of!

83
00:06:20,078 --> 00:06:22,247
Word Soul Magic...

84
00:06:22,997 --> 00:06:27,210
[speaking demon language]

85
00:06:28,586 --> 00:06:31,047
Just when I think I've
seen his worst move,

86
00:06:31,131 --> 00:06:32,424
he's got more!

87
00:06:32,507 --> 00:06:35,635
[KOTODAMA DEVIL cackles]

88
00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:38,138
I am a being from
another dimension,

89
00:06:38,221 --> 00:06:41,683
the likes of which you
cannot begin to fathom!

90
00:06:41,766 --> 00:06:44,310
You're doomed!

91
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,236
[YAMI]
What the hell is happening?

92
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:56,364
That magic. Is it from
the world of the dead?

93
00:06:56,448 --> 00:07:01,619
[KOTODAMA DEVIL cackling]

94
00:07:09,336 --> 00:07:11,921
[YAMI] Cut 'em off
and they grow right back.

95
00:07:18,011 --> 00:07:20,305
[YAMI]
Yup. We're screwed.

96
00:07:24,684 --> 00:07:26,478
What is that?

97
00:07:26,561 --> 00:07:28,355
No idea.

98
00:07:33,193 --> 00:07:36,613
[sighs] Even with Spatial
Magic, that was a long trip.

99
00:07:36,696 --> 00:07:38,114
Don't waste time.

100
00:07:38,198 --> 00:07:42,327
Okay, okay, I got it.
Stupid bird.

101
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:44,204
[NERO] Take out the
magic stones embedded

102
00:07:44,287 --> 00:07:47,165
within this monument.

103

[FINRAL] Hey. All the magic
stones that were stolen

104
00:07:50,335 --> 00:07:54,547
by the Eye of the Midnight Sun
are inside this thing.

105
00:07:54,631 --> 00:07:56,424
Are you sure I can do that?

106
00:07:56,508 --> 00:07:58,426
Make it quick.

107
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:02,764
Now. Place the stones
into the statue.

108
00:08:02,847 --> 00:08:06,810
[FINRAL]
It's the First Wizard King.

109
00:08:06,893 --> 00:08:08,311
Here goes.

110
00:08:14,192 --> 00:08:17,070
And now the eyes.

111
00:08:17,153 --> 00:08:18,780
Almost done.

112

No way! What's happening?

wrong with our spells?

and my physical strength!

Soon you'll be too weak

to carry your sword.

devastating spell that depletes

123
00:09:01,614 --> 00:09:04,409
the life force from all it
touches, and once it starts,

124

there's no way to stop it!

125
00:09:06,703 --> 00:09:10,707
Eventually, it'll devour
all of existence!

[KOTODAMA DEVIL cackles]

[YAMI] Damn. This keeps
getting more hopeless.

There's something
coming toward us!

What is that stuff?

130
00:09:27,098 --> 00:09:29,267

The devil's power!

Light Swords of Conviction!

[YUNO]
Wind Magic: Tornado Fang!

133
00:09:40,153 --> 00:09:43,698
It's absorbing all
of our spells!

It's not stopping! Stay back!

Asta!

killed me for sure!

Oh, thank goodness!

141
00:10:08,723 --> 00:10:11,935
[PATRY] Anti-magic works
against that, too?

142
00:10:12,018 --> 00:10:14,062
And he isn't even injured!

feel like swallowing

This is so bizarre.

the way! Thanks a lot!

Oh, no! I knew it.

There's even more of
that eerie magic power

149
00:10:27,575 --> 00:10:29,369
hovering above us right now.

150
00:10:29,452 --> 00:10:30,954
Which means the people
in the other rooms

151
00:10:31,037 --> 00:10:32,914
are in danger, too.

152

the swiftness to get

the possessed
Magic Knights out...

154
00:10:39,546 --> 00:10:41,172
We have to protect
the Clover Kingdom

155
00:10:41,256 --> 00:10:43,967
from this threat without
abandoning any of our own.

156
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:46,678
I'll go and assist everyone
in the lower rooms.

157
00:10:46,761 --> 00:10:48,722
You'd better come
with me, Vermillion.

158
00:10:48,805 --> 00:10:49,889
Yes, sir.

159
00:10:49,973 --> 00:10:51,683
You three seem to
understand the enemy

160
00:10:51,766 --> 00:10:54,519
and what's going on
above more than I do.

161
00:10:54,602 --> 00:10:57,188
If you can find a way
to use Asta's Anti-magic,

162
00:10:57,272 --> 00:10:59,733
Yuno's Spirit Magic,
and the elf's Light Magic

163
00:10:59,816 --> 00:11:01,192
in tandem with one another,

164
00:11:01,276 --> 00:11:04,279
you should make it
to the main chamber.

165
00:11:04,362 --> 00:11:06,114
Get moving.

166
00:11:06,197 --> 00:11:07,532
Right!

167
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,669
Now that your seal has
finally been broken,

168
00:11:19,753 --> 00:11:22,881
I'm assuming my own seal
will be released, as well.

169
00:11:22,964 --> 00:11:25,425
Huh? Nero.

170
00:11:25,508 --> 00:11:27,510
What a pathetic state you're in.

171
00:11:27,594 --> 00:11:30,430
If only my spell had
worked more completely.

172
00:11:30,513 --> 00:11:33,600
No. Without your help,
I couldn't return at all.

173
00:11:33,683 --> 00:11:35,060
[FINRAL]
Huh?

174
00:11:35,143 --> 00:11:39,189
It's good to see you
again, my prince.

175
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:46,279
At long last.

176
00:11:46,363 --> 00:11:48,448
You're the First Wizard King.

177
00:11:48,531 --> 00:11:51,493
That statue--it was
you the whole time?

178
00:11:51,576 --> 00:11:52,827
And how did Nero--

179
00:11:52,911 --> 00:11:54,037
[yelps]

180
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,164
[FINRAL] No way! Nero,
is that really you?

181
00:11:56,247 --> 00:12:00,001
You look, um, kinda different.

182
00:12:00,085 --> 00:12:02,420
Hello! If I had known
you were secretly

183
00:12:02,504 --> 00:12:04,047
a gorgeous young lady,
I would have asked you

184
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:05,298
on a date forever ago!

185
00:12:05,382 --> 00:12:08,802
But hey, there's no time
like the present, right?

186
00:12:08,885 --> 00:12:10,762
Yup. Cool. Got it.

187
00:12:12,055 --> 00:12:13,890
[LUMIERE]
I sense an otherworldly magic

188
00:12:13,973 --> 00:12:17,060
emanating from the
Shadow Palace. I see.

189
00:12:17,143 --> 00:12:19,604
He must have obtained
a new body, then.

190
00:12:19,688 --> 00:12:22,357
Back to you guys.
How'd you get here?

191
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,484
Long ago, she used
her Sealing Magic

192
00:12:24,567 --> 00:12:27,404
to confine me within the statue
when I was close to death,

193
00:12:27,487 --> 00:12:29,280
so I've been sleeping.

194
00:12:32,534 --> 00:12:34,953
[LUMIERE] Then tonight, with
the help of the magic stones,

195
00:12:35,036 --> 00:12:38,123
I was able to return,
at least partially.

196
00:12:38,206 --> 00:12:41,668
[FINRAL] His mana's
so calm, yet so powerful.

197
00:12:41,751 --> 00:12:44,421
It's even stronger
than elf magic!

198
00:12:44,504 --> 00:12:45,880
[LUMIERE]
As for her...

199
00:12:45,964 --> 00:12:49,718
The truth is, I spent five
centuries living as a bird.

200
00:12:49,801 --> 00:12:53,847
Uh, why are you holding my ha--

201
00:12:53,930 --> 00:13:00,645
[FINRAL screaming]

202
00:13:00,729 --> 00:13:01,855
Sealing Magic:

203
00:13:01,938 --> 00:13:03,398
Inverse Release!

204
00:13:06,276 --> 00:13:07,819
Huh?

205
00:13:07,902 --> 00:13:10,822
Now, then, wait
for your friends!

206
00:13:10,905 --> 00:13:12,699
And thank you for
setting me free!

207
00:13:12,782 --> 00:13:14,159
[yelps]

208
00:13:18,371 --> 00:13:20,331
You've been waiting
for 500 years.

209
00:13:20,415 --> 00:13:21,541
I'm so sorry.

210
00:13:21,624 --> 00:13:23,543
No.

211
00:13:25,712 --> 00:13:27,922
[SECRÉ] The most important
thing is that we make sure

212
00:13:28,006 --> 00:13:30,592
history doesn't repeat itself.

213
00:13:40,477 --> 00:13:43,521
[SECRÉ] As a noble, I should
have been a powerful mage,

214
00:13:43,605 --> 00:13:45,482
but my magic was only
good for opening

215
00:13:45,565 --> 00:13:49,861
and closing things, so others
looked on it with contempt.

216
00:13:49,944 --> 00:13:52,781
And I was assigned to
serve an eccentric prince

217
00:13:52,864 --> 00:13:56,826
whose magic was amazing
even for royalty.

218
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:59,829
He's probably a snob.

219
00:13:59,913 --> 00:14:01,414
Why hello there.

220
00:14:01,498 --> 00:14:04,834
You must be Secré,
right? I'm sorry.

221
00:14:04,918 --> 00:14:06,836
I would have come to you,
but I've been so buried

222
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,505
in my research lately.

223
00:14:08,588 --> 00:14:11,257
Tell me, what's your magic like?

224
00:14:11,341 --> 00:14:14,511
[SECRÉ] But he wasn't
what I imagined at all.

225
00:14:14,594 --> 00:14:16,763
[LUMIERE]
Sealing Magic?

226
00:14:16,846 --> 00:14:18,807
I've never heard of that before!

227
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,643
It must be rare.
You're so lucky!

228
00:14:21,726 --> 00:14:23,353
How can we put it to use?

229
00:14:23,436 --> 00:14:26,272
Thinking about it
is so exciting!

230
00:14:26,356 --> 00:14:28,692
[SECRÉ] All it does
is open and close locks.

231
00:14:28,775 --> 00:14:29,651
It's shameful.

232
00:14:29,734 --> 00:14:31,194
[LUMIERE]
Hey, don't say that!

233
00:14:31,277 --> 00:14:33,613
You're <i>sealing</i> yourself off
from the possibilities!

234
00:14:33,697 --> 00:14:36,282
[SECRÉ] I hope you don't think
you just said something clever.

235
00:14:36,366 --> 00:14:37,409
[LUMIERE]
Aw.

236
00:14:37,492 --> 00:14:39,327
[SECRÉ]
Also, your clothes are strange.

237
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:41,705
[LUMIERE]
What? But I made them myself!

238
00:14:41,788 --> 00:14:43,039
You don't like them?

239
00:14:43,123 --> 00:14:44,290
[SECRÉ]
More importantly...

240
00:14:44,374 --> 00:14:46,126
[LUMIERE]
Don't change the subject!

241
00:14:46,209 --> 00:14:47,335
What is it you need?

242
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:49,713
I'm supposed to be
your servant, after all.

243
00:14:49,796 --> 00:14:51,756
[LUMIERE]
Hm, good question.

244
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,551
Right now, I'm trying to
make some magical tools.

245
00:14:54,634 --> 00:14:55,927
Magical tools?

246
00:14:56,011 --> 00:14:56,970
[LUMIERE]
That's right.

247
00:14:57,053 --> 00:14:58,847
With these, even
someone born without

248
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:01,433
any magic can use
all kinds of spells.

249
00:15:01,516 --> 00:15:03,476
I think it'll be a good way
to make our society

250
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,186
more equal in the future.

251
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:08,189
Equal? You're dreaming.

252
00:15:08,273 --> 00:15:11,818
It can be done, with the help
of my "magic items."

253
00:15:11,901 --> 00:15:15,363
I'm sure your ability will
be a huge help in making them!

254
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:18,533
I know. Can you seal
magic into objects?

255
00:15:18,616 --> 00:15:19,951
[SECRÉ]
Um, yes.

256
00:15:20,035 --> 00:15:22,704
[LUMIERE]
Wow, really? That's perfect!

257
00:15:24,914 --> 00:15:26,750
[SECRÉ]
And so... I helped the prince

258
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:29,169
with his magical inventions.

259
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:35,967
[SECRÉ] I'd never met anyone
else like him in my whole life.

260
00:15:36,051 --> 00:15:37,635
There were some
members of his family

261
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:40,680
who resented him because
of the progressive ideas

262
00:15:40,764 --> 00:15:42,766
that he championed.

263
00:15:44,309 --> 00:15:46,603
[SECRÉ] But he didn't
let that bother him.

264
00:15:46,686 --> 00:15:51,608
He remained strong and honest,
never compromising his beliefs.

265
00:15:53,943 --> 00:15:55,570
[gasps]

266
00:15:59,407 --> 00:16:02,243
[SECRÉ] I've noticed that
he and his sister, Lady Tetia,

267
00:16:02,327 --> 00:16:05,789
have been sneaking out of
the castle quite a lot recently.

268
00:16:05,872 --> 00:16:08,625
What could they be doing here?

269
00:16:11,336 --> 00:16:12,504
[gasps]

270
00:16:12,587 --> 00:16:15,548
[SECRÉ] They're meeting
with a group of elves?

271
00:16:15,632 --> 00:16:19,469
Phenomenal magic talent,
similar ideals,

272
00:16:19,552 --> 00:16:21,888
the same four-leaf grimoires.

273
00:16:21,971 --> 00:16:24,516
For the first time,
the prince had found a peer

274
00:16:24,599 --> 00:16:27,477
in Licht, the
leader of the elves.

275
00:16:29,854 --> 00:16:31,731
Let's foster understanding.

276
00:16:31,815 --> 00:16:35,235
Your elvish mana really
is a remarkable thing!

277
00:16:35,318 --> 00:16:38,822
If we combine that with our
own magic-item technology,

278
00:16:38,905 --> 00:16:42,075
this land will be safer
and more prosperous!

279
00:16:42,158 --> 00:16:44,536
Let's all work together,
hand in hand!

280
00:16:44,619 --> 00:16:48,081
[ELVES laugh, chatter]

281
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:52,419
[SECRÉ] His items stored
and distributed magic,

282
00:16:52,502 --> 00:16:54,546
and their magic stones
amplified spells

283
00:16:54,629 --> 00:16:56,798
by linking to another world.

284
00:16:56,881 --> 00:16:59,926
By combining his work
with the elves' resources,

285
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:02,220
the prince developed
magic-item technology

286
00:17:02,303 --> 00:17:04,848
ever further, and the
world he'd dreamed of,

287
00:17:04,931 --> 00:17:07,058
where both races
could live in harmony,

288
00:17:07,142 --> 00:17:09,227
was becoming a reality.

289
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:11,521
He and Licht were best friends.

290
00:17:11,604 --> 00:17:16,317
And soon, they would
become family as well.

291
00:17:16,401 --> 00:17:18,737
[LUMIERE] I'm sorry, Tetia,
but it looks like

292
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:21,489
I might have to arrive
late to your wedding.

293
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:23,700
Father has summoned me
to the palace that day,

294
00:17:23,783 --> 00:17:26,077
and I can't refuse.

295
00:17:26,161 --> 00:17:28,288
I know you're disappointed
that he and the others

296
00:17:28,371 --> 00:17:31,291
don't approve of this,
but please, don't worry.

297
00:17:31,374 --> 00:17:33,877
I'm sure they'll come
to understand someday.

298
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,129
[TETIA] Yes. And it's
all right. Even if you're late

299
00:17:36,212 --> 00:17:37,922
to the ceremony,
Licht and his family

300
00:17:38,006 --> 00:17:40,550
will be so pleased
to see you there.

301
00:17:42,344 --> 00:17:46,097
[SECRÉ]
But, it's likely that even then,

302
00:17:46,181 --> 00:17:49,476
his plot was already in motion.

303
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:51,895
[LUMIERE]
Why did Father call me here?

304
00:17:51,978 --> 00:17:53,605
We didn't mention
the wedding to anyone,

305
00:17:53,688 --> 00:17:58,693
so it must be coincidence.
I should hurry, or I'll miss it.

306
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:00,236
Where is he?

307
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,531
I'm here, Father. You
wanted to speak with me?

308
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:04,783
[KOTODAMA DEVIL]
Now "Bind!"

309
00:18:04,866 --> 00:18:06,284
[gasps]

310
00:18:09,162 --> 00:18:11,373
What's this? I'm trapped!

311
00:18:11,456 --> 00:18:15,418
[KOTODAMA DEVIL cackles]
Good day, my prince.

312
00:18:15,502 --> 00:18:17,962
[LUMIERE]
Minister? No.

313
00:18:18,046 --> 00:18:21,716
That villainous mana
doesn't belong to him.

314
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,176
Who are you?

315
00:18:23,259 --> 00:18:26,179
[KOTODAMA DEVIL cackles]
Who, me?

316
00:18:26,262 --> 00:18:28,807
Despair, hatred,
disloyalty, death--

317
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:31,184
any number of
awful things, really.

318
00:18:31,267 --> 00:18:33,561
Use whatever name you prefer.

319
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:34,688
[gasps]

320
00:18:34,771 --> 00:18:36,523
[LUMIERE]
I've read about this being.

321
00:18:36,606 --> 00:18:39,442
A soul from the other
world with evil mana.

322
00:18:39,526 --> 00:18:41,277
A devil!

323
00:18:41,361 --> 00:18:42,696
[LUMIERE]
Where's my family?

324
00:18:42,779 --> 00:18:43,947
[KOTODAMA DEVIL]
Who knows?

325
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,532
Perhaps they've gone to
confront that other race

326
00:18:45,615 --> 00:18:47,909
that's plotting to use your
unwitting princess to topple

327
00:18:47,992 --> 00:18:51,079
this entire kingdom,
but that's only a guess.

328
00:18:51,162 --> 00:18:54,124
Imagine how surprised
the elves will be

329
00:18:54,207 --> 00:18:56,334
when a monstrous act
of human violence

330
00:18:56,418 --> 00:18:58,962
befalls that little wedding
ceremony that only you

331
00:18:59,045 --> 00:19:01,923
were supposed to
know was happening.

332
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:05,385
No, let go! Now!

333
00:19:05,468 --> 00:19:08,847
[KOTODAMA DEVIL cackles]
What an impressive spell!

334
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:11,182
That's why they
call you the best!

335
00:19:11,266 --> 00:19:13,226
Unfortunately, I was
prepared for that,

336
00:19:13,309 --> 00:19:17,230
so even you won't escape
from those bonds so easily.

337
00:19:17,313 --> 00:19:19,441
As soon as I obtain
my body and grimoire,

338
00:19:19,524 --> 00:19:23,069
I promise I'll come back
to play with you again.

339
00:19:23,153 --> 00:19:26,322
[LUMIERE]
Wait!

340
00:19:26,406 --> 00:19:30,243
Help me! Isn't
anyone here? Please!

341
00:19:30,326 --> 00:19:31,578
[SECRÉ]
Prince!

342
00:19:31,661 --> 00:19:32,871
Thank goodness!

343
00:19:32,954 --> 00:19:34,873
Oh, no! What's that?

344
00:19:34,956 --> 00:19:36,750
[LUMIERE]
I've been trapped by a devil!

345
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:39,127
I knew you would
never do such a thing.

346
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:44,382
I'm not sure why, but the magic
item we created was stolen!

347
00:19:44,466 --> 00:19:47,010
[LUMIERE]
Quick. Use your Sealing Magic!

348
00:19:47,093 --> 00:19:49,012
Get me out of these restraints!

349
00:19:49,095 --> 00:19:53,099
Of course! Sealing Magic:
Inverse Release!

350
00:19:59,856 --> 00:20:01,941
[LUMIERE]
Come on, fly faster!

351
00:20:02,025 --> 00:20:04,527
Tetia, Licht, hold on!

352
00:20:04,944 --> 00:20:06,529
[LUMIERE, SECRÉ gasp]

353
00:20:06,613 --> 00:20:08,406
[LUMIERE]
There's the device we made!

354
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:23,588
No.

355
00:20:24,714 --> 00:20:26,466
[LICHT gasps]

356
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:34,432
[SECRÉ]
That's a five-leaf grimoire.

357
00:20:34,516 --> 00:20:35,934
[LICHT]
I knew it.

358
00:20:36,017 --> 00:20:37,227
Knew what?

359
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:41,189
Deep inside. I knew you
weren't responsible.

360
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:46,736
[KOTODAMA DEVIL] Has he
reclaimed control of his heart?

361
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,154
Please forgive me.

362
00:20:48,238 --> 00:20:50,699
I should never have harbored
any suspicion of you,

363
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:52,117
not for a second.

364
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,035
Don't bother resisting!

365
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:58,123
It's too late now,
relinquish your body to me!

366
00:20:58,206 --> 00:21:01,001
You are the future
we all believed in.

367
00:21:01,084 --> 00:21:03,211
You represent hope.

368
00:21:04,587 --> 00:21:06,339
What are you...?

369
00:21:06,423 --> 00:21:08,717
[LICHT] Right now,
my body is filled with

370
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,594
an overwhelming amount
of negative mana.

371
00:21:11,678 --> 00:21:14,431
I can't control myself,
but we mustn't let

372
00:21:14,514 --> 00:21:16,433
that devil succeed.

373
00:21:16,516 --> 00:21:18,309
No, Licht.

374
00:21:18,393 --> 00:21:20,186
[LICHT] In order to keep
my body and power

375
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:22,814
from falling under
the influence of evil,

376
00:21:22,897 --> 00:21:26,234
I've absorbed even
more negative magic.

377
00:21:26,317 --> 00:21:27,402
The stones!

378
00:21:27,485 --> 00:21:29,529
He used the highest form
of forbidden magic

379
00:21:29,612 --> 00:21:30,864
on his own body?

380
00:21:30,947 --> 00:21:33,533
[LUMIERE]
Stop it. You can't do this!

381
00:21:33,616 --> 00:21:37,871
[LICHT] I'm sorry, but I have
one last selfish request,

382
00:21:37,954 --> 00:21:42,208
and only you can
grant it. I beg of you.

383
00:21:47,088 --> 00:21:49,549
This isn't the answer!

384
00:22:12,072 --> 00:22:13,990
[LICHT]
Lumiere.

385
00:22:16,993 --> 00:22:20,705
[LICHT]
I need you to kill me!

386
00:23:56,926 --> 00:23:58,970
[SECRÉ] This was all
planned by that devil.

387
00:23:59,054 --> 00:24:01,056
Let's set things
right, my prince.

388
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:02,474
We can save the world!

389
00:24:02,557 --> 00:24:04,684
<i>Black Clover</i> , Page 118:

"A Reunion Across
Time and Space."

391
00:24:07,187 --> 00:24:08,480
We didn't give up back then,

392
00:24:08,563 --> 00:24:10,982
and we aren't going
to give up now!
