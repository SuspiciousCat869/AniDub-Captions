1
00:01:54,187 --> 00:01:56,690
[LIEBE] Devils are born
in the underworld.

2
00:01:56,773 --> 00:01:59,526
From the first breath
you take, you have a spot

3
00:01:59,609 --> 00:02:04,364
in the pecking order, and
it's impossible to change it.

4
00:02:04,447 --> 00:02:07,659
Since I was born with
no magic, obviously,

5
00:02:07,742 --> 00:02:09,619
I was at the bottom.

6
00:02:09,703 --> 00:02:12,414
I spent every day
covered in my own blood.

7
00:02:12,497 --> 00:02:13,456
You're so pitiful,

8
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,875
it's not even fun
to beat you up!

9
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:18,420
If only that didn't exist.

10
00:02:18,503 --> 00:02:19,963
[LIEBE]
Every devil wishes they could

11
00:02:20,046 --> 00:02:22,882
cross over into the human world.

12
00:02:22,966 --> 00:02:26,886
But the underworld gate stops
them from getting through.

13
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:30,598
So to pass the time,
the strong oppress the weak,

14
00:02:30,682 --> 00:02:33,852
and the weak oppress anyone
weaker than they are.

15
00:02:33,935 --> 00:02:36,062
That's how shitty
things are there.

16
00:02:36,146 --> 00:02:40,275
Go on and cry. Scream
for mercy like always!

17
00:02:40,358 --> 00:02:42,902
[LIEBE]
I didn't care about anything,

18
00:02:42,986 --> 00:02:45,321
not even whether
I lived or died.

19
00:02:45,405 --> 00:02:48,658
You brat. What's so funny?

20
00:02:48,742 --> 00:02:52,579
[DEVILS laugh]

21
00:02:52,662 --> 00:02:54,956
[LIEBE] I figured I would
crash into the gate

22
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,167
and my body would shatter.

23
00:03:07,344 --> 00:03:09,721
[LIEBE] But since
I didn't have any magic,

24
00:03:09,804 --> 00:03:11,639
I slipped right through.

25
00:03:11,723 --> 00:03:15,435
And before I knew it,
I ended up in the human world.

26
00:03:15,518 --> 00:03:17,896
Maybe it was because
I was helpless.

27
00:03:17,979 --> 00:03:21,191
Or because I was exhausted
from all the beatings,

28
00:03:21,274 --> 00:03:24,569
but I didn't care one way
or the other about humans.

29
00:03:24,652 --> 00:03:26,071
Still...

30
00:03:26,154 --> 00:03:28,365
Over there! It's got horns!

31
00:03:28,448 --> 00:03:29,199
Could it be...?

32
00:03:29,282 --> 00:03:31,451
A devil! He'll curse us!

33
00:03:31,534 --> 00:03:33,703
[MAN 170B] Someone call
the Magic Knights!

34
00:03:35,246 --> 00:03:36,247
[LIEBE]
It didn't take long

35
00:03:36,331 --> 00:03:38,041
for humans with powerful magic

36
00:03:38,124 --> 00:03:42,671
to find and attack me.
My body started shutting down.

37
00:03:42,754 --> 00:03:45,215
I was ready to accept my death.

38
00:03:47,884 --> 00:03:51,221
[LIEBE]
Finally, this pointless life'll

39
00:03:51,304 --> 00:03:53,556
be over forever.

40
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,226

[LICITA gasps]
You're awake? Thank goodness!

43
00:04:04,818 --> 00:04:07,821
My name is Licita.
It's nice to meet you!

44
00:04:07,904 --> 00:04:10,407
I figured you'd be
safer at my house.

45
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:12,283
It's okay, you can relax.

46
00:04:12,367 --> 00:04:15,662
No one knows you're here, so
they won't come looking for you.

47
00:04:15,745 --> 00:04:17,789
I just used my magic ability.

48
00:04:20,542 --> 00:04:22,127
If something doesn't have mana,

49
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:25,422
I can use my ability to put it
into and take it out of things.

50
00:04:25,505 --> 00:04:28,008
I found you while I was out
gathering some firewood,

51
00:04:28,091 --> 00:04:30,301
so I just popped
you in this bottle.

52
00:04:31,302 --> 00:04:33,388
[LICITA] You can imagine
how shocked I was!

53
00:04:33,471 --> 00:04:36,641
I mean, just the other day, I
found this five-leaf grimoire,

54
00:04:36,725 --> 00:04:38,101
but stumbling across a devil

55
00:04:38,184 --> 00:04:40,937
was an even bigger
surprise than that!

56
00:04:41,021 --> 00:04:42,397
You're weird.

57
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,607
Shouldn't you be
more afraid of me?

58
00:04:44,691 --> 00:04:47,777
[laughs] Why would I be
afraid of a little boy

59
00:04:47,861 --> 00:04:49,154
who's all beat up?

60
00:04:49,237 --> 00:04:52,949
After all, it's not like
you have any magic.

61
00:04:53,033 --> 00:04:55,660
Yeah, but all humans
hate devils, don't they?

62
00:04:55,744 --> 00:04:58,621
Tsk, tsk, tsk. Sure,
people might hate you,

63
00:04:58,705 --> 00:05:00,331
but you're not the only one.

64
00:05:03,126 --> 00:05:05,712
[LICITA] You see?
My body saps magic and life

65
00:05:05,795 --> 00:05:08,298
away from anything that
gets too close to me.

66
00:05:08,381 --> 00:05:10,300
I can't help it.

67
00:05:10,383 --> 00:05:12,135
That's why I live alone.

68
00:05:12,218 --> 00:05:13,553
I keep my distance
from the village,

69
00:05:13,636 --> 00:05:15,388
so I don't bother anyone.

70
00:05:16,514 --> 00:05:19,893
But luckily! You
don't have any mana,

71
00:05:19,976 --> 00:05:22,812
and it doesn't look like
I'm draining your life, either.

72
00:05:22,896 --> 00:05:25,857
I guess it's because
you're a devil?

73
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,817
It's gotta be destiny!

74
00:05:27,901 --> 00:05:30,487
I know! Maybe I
should adopt you!

75
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,238
Adopt me?

76
00:05:32,322 --> 00:05:35,367
[LIEBE] A human raising
a devil as her own?

77
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:38,370
I couldn't wrap my head
around it at all.

78
00:05:38,453 --> 00:05:39,537
But...

79
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:45,126
Come on, we gotta hurry up!

80
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:49,172

82
00:05:50,548 --> 00:05:52,050
[LIEBE]
That human...

83
00:05:52,133 --> 00:05:54,678
[LICITA giggles]
It's so pretty!

84
00:05:54,761 --> 00:05:56,012
Uh-huh.

85
00:05:56,096 --> 00:05:57,764
[LIEBE] I couldn't believe
she would open her heart

86
00:05:57,847 --> 00:05:59,766
to someone like me.

87
00:05:59,849 --> 00:06:03,853
A devil, born with no magic
in a dark, hopeless pit,

88
00:06:03,937 --> 00:06:06,856
who cursed my own existence.

89
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:10,443
That woman changed my
whole world for the better.

90
00:06:13,154 --> 00:06:15,323
Just because you're a devil,
that doesn't automatically

91
00:06:15,407 --> 00:06:18,034
mean that you're some kind of
evil being at heart!

92
00:06:18,118 --> 00:06:19,869
Trust me!

93
00:06:19,953 --> 00:06:22,580
I know for sure
you're not a bad guy!

94
00:06:22,664 --> 00:06:23,832
Thanks to you,

95
00:06:23,915 --> 00:06:26,751
I don't have to live
my whole life all alone!

00:06:26,835 --> 00:06:29,254
You saved me, Liebe!

97
00:06:29,337 --> 00:06:31,631
I saved you?

[gasps]

103
00:06:45,645 --> 00:06:47,689
I never thought I would
find a devil out here

104
00:06:47,772 --> 00:06:50,066
in the human world who
hadn't made a contract

105
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:52,444
with anyone yet so,

106
00:06:52,527 --> 00:06:55,238
I'm glad I took the time
to look around!

107
00:06:55,321 --> 00:06:58,033
[LIEBE] That's one of
the highest-ranked devils!

108
00:06:58,116 --> 00:07:01,161
He's taking control of my body!

109
00:07:01,244 --> 00:07:03,246
Must be my lucky day!

110
00:07:03,329 --> 00:07:06,291
If I play my cards right, I'm
sure there's a way I can use

111
00:07:06,374 --> 00:07:09,961
this weakling to manifest
my own body in this world--

112
00:07:10,045 --> 00:07:11,087
That's enough!

113

Get out of Liebe's

I may not have full
use of my powers,

no match for me--

You're not taking my son!

126

[LUCIFERO]
Impossible!

127
00:08:02,597 --> 00:08:05,517
To think a mere human
could get in my way!

128
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,685
No matter.

129
00:08:06,768 --> 00:08:09,020
I can meddle with
a lower devil anywhere.

130
00:08:09,104 --> 00:08:11,272
I shall return in time.

131

[gasps] Licita, are you...?

132
00:08:20,573 --> 00:08:26,204
I'm sorry. I guess
I'm kinda stupid.

133
00:08:26,287 --> 00:08:28,998
This was the only way I could
think of to protect you

134
00:08:29,082 --> 00:08:31,626
from that horrible monster.

135
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:35,255
I'll use my magic to seal you
into this five-leaf grimoire,

where you'll be safe.

00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:40,218
By the time someone
releases you from it,

138
00:08:40,301 --> 00:08:43,847
I'm sure you'll have gotten
a lot bigger and stronger.

139
00:08:48,977 --> 00:08:56,276
Please, Liebe, live, okay?
I love you, my sweet little boy.

Look, loser.

Just hand over
the body, already!

[ASTA]
His ki.

144
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:35,398
It's full of anger and
hatred, and... sadness!

145
00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:41,029
[ASTA] I'm sure you have
your reasons, just like I do.

146
00:09:41,112 --> 00:09:43,615
I'll try to accept that
and figure out

147
00:09:43,698 --> 00:09:45,575
what you're so mad about.

148
00:09:45,658 --> 00:09:47,035
Then I'll win!

[LIEBE] You gotta be
kidding me, you idiot!

You really think you can
beat me with one arm?

[ASTA grunts]

152
00:10:08,807 --> 00:10:12,602
Yeah, you heard me!
I still got plenty of muscle!

153
00:10:15,021 --> 00:10:17,816
[NACHT] The devil fights with
Anti-magic, which is primarily

154
00:10:17,899 --> 00:10:20,944
used to nullify an

155
00:10:21,027 --> 00:10:22,654
Since Asta doesn't have any,

00:10:22,737 --> 00:10:24,739
it's not much of
a threat to him.

Captain Yami's katana!

Without my Anti-magic,
those swords are useless!

161
00:10:40,338 --> 00:10:42,215
They're just hunks of steel!

162
00:10:52,726 --> 00:10:55,603
I don't give a damn about
your physical strength!

163
00:10:55,687 --> 00:10:59,274
You're screwed! No magic
means no spatial transfer!

164
00:10:59,357 --> 00:11:02,318
So you can't break this blade!

00:11:06,322 --> 00:11:08,742
How could you stand a chance
against a high-ranked devil

168
00:11:08,825 --> 00:11:12,245
if you can't even hold your
own in a fight with me?

169
00:11:12,328 --> 00:11:14,456
Stop kidding yourself!

170
00:11:16,332 --> 00:11:18,418
[LIEBE]
After that, I was sealed away

171
00:11:18,501 --> 00:11:22,213
within the five-leaf grimoire,
with no means of escape.

[LIEBE]
They're gonna pay for this.

173
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:29,346
I'll kill them!
All of them! I swear!

174
00:11:29,429 --> 00:11:32,223
[LIEBE] I spent all
my time cursing Lucifero

175

and the other devils.
And then...

176
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:38,396
I gained the power
of Anti-magic,

177
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,690
the power to nullify spells.

178

This is it!

[LIEBE yells]

[LIEBE]
One day, the five-leaf grimoire

182
00:11:52,285 --> 00:11:56,039
chose a human to
become its master.

183
00:11:56,122 --> 00:11:57,415
As luck would have it,

184
00:11:57,499 --> 00:12:00,085
this kid was born
with no magic, too.

185
00:12:00,168 --> 00:12:02,587
I realized that if I ever
wanted to go back out

186
00:12:02,671 --> 00:12:05,215
into the human world,
the only way

187
00:12:05,298 --> 00:12:08,510
was for me to use him as a host.

188
00:12:08,593 --> 00:12:13,264
I'd take over his
entire body if I had to.

189
00:12:13,348 --> 00:12:14,933
In case you haven't
figured it out,

190
00:12:15,016 --> 00:12:17,268
every devil is an
evil piece of shit!

191

Which is exactly why
I'll personally make sure

192
00:12:19,604 --> 00:12:21,398
every last one of
them is destroyed,

193

I'll let my hatred run wild
and kill them all!

I think I finally
understand you.

You can't use magic

But I still dodged your swords!

All I had to do was focus
on reading your ki, big guy!

[growls]

206
00:13:15,618 --> 00:13:17,996
[ASTA] It's true,
I don't have any magic.

207
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,749
And without you, I don't
even have Anti-magic.

208
00:13:20,832 --> 00:13:22,709
But I've got the will to win,

209
00:13:22,792 --> 00:13:27,630
and my unbreakable bonds with
all the amazing people I've met!

210
00:13:27,714 --> 00:13:30,383
Yuno and I were taken in
by the church in Hage Village

211
00:13:30,467 --> 00:13:34,971
on the same day, and I didn't
have one bit of mana!

212
00:13:35,055 --> 00:13:37,974
Yuno is cooler than me
and he's smarter than me!

213
00:13:38,058 --> 00:13:39,642
But he's still my rival.

214
00:13:39,726 --> 00:13:42,854
We decided we would compete to
see who'd become Wizard King!

215
00:13:42,937 --> 00:13:44,856
Having him in my life
is what inspired me

216
00:13:44,939 --> 00:13:47,525
to keep getting better!

217
00:13:47,609 --> 00:13:50,111
Then, I met Captain Yami
at the entrance exam

218
00:13:50,195 --> 00:13:51,780
and I joined the Black Bulls!

219
00:13:51,863 --> 00:13:55,575
And without them, I wouldn't
be the person I am today!

220
00:13:55,658 --> 00:13:57,160
And it's not just them!

221
00:13:57,243 --> 00:14:01,122
I've met lots of people--
friends and enemies!

222
00:14:01,206 --> 00:14:03,458
There were a lot
of tough battles.

223
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:04,626
A few of the opponents I fought

224
00:14:04,709 --> 00:14:07,754
became my friends
after it was all over.

225
00:14:07,837 --> 00:14:09,756
And some of them didn't.

226
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,258
But I won't forget
a single one of them!

227
00:14:12,342 --> 00:14:14,469
Because each of those
people are a part of me,

228
00:14:14,552 --> 00:14:16,721
and they always will be!

you're the strongest.

No matter how hard you train,

may just pay off.

that you're up against

The preparations for the
ritual are now complete.

266
00:17:21,322 --> 00:17:24,284
The next step is establishing
a contract with your devil,

267
00:17:24,367 --> 00:17:27,078
giving you total
control over him.

268
00:17:27,162 --> 00:17:28,371
This part's easy.

269
00:17:28,455 --> 00:17:31,207
Simply think "obey me,"
and from this moment on,

270
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:33,293
you'll have a devoted
familiar to aid you

271

and follow your every command.

That's the only way to
become the ultimate warrior.

Okay. Then...

274
00:17:49,309 --> 00:17:52,479
Starting right now,
we should be friends!

What's the matter,

00:17:57,484 --> 00:17:59,486
devils don't even know
what a friend is?

Hold on a second.

Are you attempting to create an
equal contract with your devil?

281
00:18:08,078 --> 00:18:09,579
Yep!

282
00:18:09,662 --> 00:18:12,582
I mentioned this earlier,
but I never could have made it

283
00:18:12,665 --> 00:18:15,543
this far without his help!

The thing is, I never
stopped to learn anything

00:18:18,046 --> 00:18:21,549
about him, even though he's been
with me for such a long time!

If we're gonna keep
working together,

287
00:18:23,134 --> 00:18:25,887
we need to become friends!

What are you talking about?

289
00:18:27,889 --> 00:18:29,641
There's no guarantee
that this devil

290
00:18:29,724 --> 00:18:31,643
will pay you any heed at all.

291
00:18:31,726 --> 00:18:34,270
Do you expect that
contract to work?

292
00:18:34,354 --> 00:18:36,481
There's nothing
binding about it!

293

[ASTA]
It's fine.

294
00:18:38,149 --> 00:18:41,653
I could tell from the beginning
he wasn't fighting me for real.

295
00:18:41,736 --> 00:18:43,780
He kept talking
about killing me,

296
00:18:43,863 --> 00:18:46,157
but I knew he was holding back!

297
00:18:46,241 --> 00:18:49,077
You can't kill anybody, can you?

298
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:53,540
What you can do is get angry
for someone else's sake!

299
00:18:53,623 --> 00:18:55,291
That's why we'd get along!

300
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:58,294
You and I should work
together as equals!

301
00:18:59,713 --> 00:19:01,423
[ASTA] This isn't
a devil-binding ritual.

It appears not.

we've got the same enemies!

So, what do you say to
forming a team with me?

could be as stupid as you are.

Oh, by the way.

316
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,546
You haven't told me
your name yet!

317
00:19:41,629 --> 00:19:43,423
What d'you mean?

318
00:19:43,506 --> 00:19:44,549
[LICITA]
You don't have one?

319
00:19:44,632 --> 00:19:48,094
That's okay, I'll pick
one out for you!

320
00:19:48,178 --> 00:19:50,096
Hm...

321
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,931
Ah! Liebe!

322
00:19:52,015 --> 00:19:54,392
Starting today,
your name's Liebe!

323
00:19:56,686 --> 00:19:59,731
[LIEBE]
There's no doubt about it.

324
00:19:59,814 --> 00:20:01,191
[chuckles]

325
00:20:01,274 --> 00:20:03,651
[LIEBE]
He's Licita's kid.

326
00:20:05,278 --> 00:20:08,531
[LIEBE]
You can call me Liebe.

327
00:20:19,167 --> 00:20:20,794
Whoa, what's that?

328
00:20:21,795 --> 00:20:25,298
[squeals] I finally
got my arm back!

329
00:20:25,382 --> 00:20:27,550
Thank you so much, buddy!

330
00:20:27,634 --> 00:20:29,969
[NACHT]
The contract is complete.

331
00:20:30,053 --> 00:20:34,015
I must admit, you've done
something truly unprecedented.

332
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:37,560
I didn't expect such a
foolish move, even from you.

333
00:20:37,644 --> 00:20:40,021
However...

334
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:42,607
You made the right choice.

335
00:20:42,691 --> 00:20:44,109
[gasps]

336
00:20:44,192 --> 00:20:45,443
Still, though.

337
00:20:45,527 --> 00:20:48,780
Being right doesn't always
mean you'll be rewarded.

338
00:20:48,863 --> 00:20:54,494
That's why you need strength,
to keep evil from prevailing.

339
00:20:54,577 --> 00:20:56,121
You have two days.

340
00:20:56,204 --> 00:20:58,581
Think you can become
the strongest?

341
00:20:58,665 --> 00:20:59,874
Yeah!

342
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,251
Eh?

343
00:21:09,384 --> 00:21:10,719
[NOELLE]
Loropechika.

344
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:13,596
I'll save you, no matter what.

345
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,224
Okay. Let's get ready!

346
00:21:29,446 --> 00:21:30,905
[FINRAL]
We can win.

347
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:35,118
Even if they're crazy strong,
we'll push past our limits!

348
00:21:35,201 --> 00:21:39,539
'Cause we're the Black Bulls!
Isn't that right, Yami?

349
00:22:23,124 --> 00:22:25,919
[panting]

350
00:22:28,171 --> 00:22:31,383
[YUNO] I'm training as hard
as I can to beat Zenon,

351
00:22:31,466 --> 00:22:34,511
but I'm not getting
the results I need.

352
00:22:34,594 --> 00:22:39,516
You can stop hiding.
Just come out here, already.

353
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:40,809
I figure it might be useful

354
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:43,853
to have a Spatial Magic
user to spar with.

355
00:22:43,937 --> 00:22:45,438
After all, it's only fair of me

356
00:22:45,522 --> 00:22:49,526
to help you with
your training, right?

357
00:22:49,609 --> 00:22:52,278
Trust me, I'd much prefer
to handle it myself,

358
00:22:52,362 --> 00:22:55,281
but this is something that
affects the whole Golden Dawn.

359
00:22:55,365 --> 00:22:58,034
I know you've improved
your skills, too,

360
00:22:58,118 --> 00:23:00,161
so I'll accept your offer.

361
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:02,372
I see you're still
an insolent brat,

362
00:23:02,455 --> 00:23:05,083
but at least you're
more straightforward now.

363
00:23:06,376 --> 00:23:09,796
[YUNO] I'm going to save
Captain Vangeance.

364
00:23:09,879 --> 00:23:14,426
All right! Hang in
there, Captain Yami!

365
00:23:14,509 --> 00:23:18,096
No matter how tough they are,
I'll take 'em down!

366
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:21,599
I'm gonna keep our kingdom
and the whole world safe!

367
00:23:23,977 --> 00:23:26,896
[NARRATOR] In this place
where magic is everything,

368
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:31,151
there lives one boy
who was born without it.

369
00:23:31,234 --> 00:23:34,404
However, despite the many
challenges he faces,

370
00:23:34,487 --> 00:23:37,240
Asta works hard and
refuses to give up.

371
00:23:37,323 --> 00:23:41,286
He and his childhood rival train
through blood, sweat, and tears,

372
00:23:41,369 --> 00:23:44,539
in hopes of one day becoming
the next Wizard King.
