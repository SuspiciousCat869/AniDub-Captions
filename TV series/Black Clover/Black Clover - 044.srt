00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:15,666
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,500
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:24,708
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:27,208
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:35,750
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:39,666
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:44,416
[NARRATOR] Soon after arriving
at the Underwater Temple

8
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,250
in search of the magic
stone, the Black Bulls

9
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:49,875
were roped into High
Priest Gifso's "game":

10
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:52,791
a high-stakes temple
battle royale.

11
00:00:52,875 --> 00:00:56,875
[GIFSO laughs] All my Temple
Mages are more powerful

12
00:00:56,958 --> 00:00:58,833
than intermediate-class
Magic Knights,

13
00:00:58,916 --> 00:01:01,333
and they're out there
fighting a bunch of juniors?

14
00:01:01,416 --> 00:01:04,000
They're losing?!
That's impossible!

15
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:07,541
Heh! It's gonna take more
than a few drops of water

16
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:09,625
to scare me off.

17
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:12,208
[NARRATOR] Magna and Luck
faced the same opponent,

18
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:14,375
vying for the chance
to defeat him.

19
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:15,500
[LUCK laughs]

20
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:17,375
First come, first served, sorry!

21
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:20,791
Lightning Magic:
Thunderbolt Destruction!

22
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:28,166
[GIO] Well, well. Aren't you
a spunky little fella.

23
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,791
I'll have you know,
my son is the most

24
00:01:29,875 --> 00:01:32,708
powerful mage in the
Underwater Temple!

25
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:34,416
[LUCK]
He's got so much power.

26
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,791
Like a tidal wave. This guy
is the strongest one here.

27
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:39,958
[GIO]
I'll take you both on at once.

28
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:43,166
I'm not interested in
tormenting you any further.

Poseidon's Hammer!

You're not gonna
be ending anything!

31
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:51,583
Yeah, I'm nowhere near
done playing with you!

32

[MAGNA, LUCK yell]

33

[GIO groans]

34
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:57,625
[NARRATOR]
The game was interrupted

35
00:01:57,708 --> 00:01:59,625
by the arrival of Vetto,
a top member

36
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:02,000
of the Eye of the Midnight Sun.

37
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:03,583
[VETTO]
Well, it looks like you folks

38
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:06,750
are having quite a get-together.

39
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:10,875
How about... you guys
let me in the mix?

40
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,833
[MIMOSA] Oh, wow! The full
moon looks so gorgeous!

41
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:00,416
[MIMOSA]
Wherever Asta is,

42
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,250
I wonder if he's looking up
at the same moon right now?

43
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,875
[MIMOSA giggles]
Silly Mimosa!

[BEACH MAGES yelling]

Ha... ha...

46
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:17,250
I guess I must have
nodded off for a bit.

Ha. Barely enough
for a decent warm-up.

54
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:38,000
That was like fighting
a bunch of puny mice.

55
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:38,875
[BEACH MAGE 44J groans]

56
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:40,000
Time to go.

[MIDNIGHT SUN MAGES]
Sir!

58
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:03,833
[SEKKE whimpers] They may not
have been expecting an attack,

59
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:06,833
but that's still a lot
of top-ranked mages.

60
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:09,041
It shouldn't have been
possible for one guy

61
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:12,416
to take them all out
in a matter of minutes!

62
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,375
These are the people we trust
to protect the kingdom.

63
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:17,083
How could this happen?

64
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:20,375
One thing's sure.
That was no human.

65
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:22,041
That thing was...

66
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:23,750
...a beast!

67
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:29,083
What's this guy
think he's doin',

68
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:32,250
crashin' our battle?
And why's he so hairy?

69
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,583
[LUCK]
Yeah, no fair.

70
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,291
Sharkhead totally
belonged to me.

71
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:38,125
[LUCK]
Maybe it's okay, though.

72
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:41,541
This guy's got more magic
power than Captain Yami.

73
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:45,583
[GIO] You made it through
the ocean currents,

74
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:48,791
and forced your way into
the Underwater Temple.

75
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:52,625
Your magic must be
formidable indeed.

76
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:55,125
Oh. I see you can still move.

77
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:56,708
Well, that hurt.

78
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:59,750
You and your buddies there sure
don't look like Magic Knights.

79
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:01,791
I know why they're here,
but what do you people

80
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,750
want with the Underwater Temple?

81
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:05,916
The same thing that they do.

82
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,500
We're here for the
magic stone, too.

83
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:11,000
Are you? Well, that's too bad.

84
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:13,250
We can't simply hand
it over, you know.

85
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:14,500
I'm sure.

86
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,875
I wouldn't want it to be
that effortless, anyway.

87
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:19,166
I'd much rather plunge
you all into to despair,

88
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,791
destroy this place,
and take the stone myself!

89
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:23,333
You what?

90
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:24,583
The rest of you, go!

91
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:26,500
Spread out through the temple.

92

[MIDNIGHT SUN MAGES]
Sir!

93
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:33,083
It's rude to drop in
uninvited like this.

94
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:35,666
I'm afraid I'll have to ask
you to leave, please.

95
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,833
[VETTO]
Silence, peon.

96
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:39,291
You really do need
to work on your manners.

97
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:41,625
It will take far
more powerful magic

98
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,875
than you possess to
make me leave this place

99
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:45,041
without that stone.

100
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:46,416
Oh, dear.

101
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,458
You clearly don't understand
who you're dealing with.

102
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:51,541
Of all the Underwater
Temple's mages,

103
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:53,708
I am the strongest by far.

104

Enough chitchat.

105
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,208
We can let our magic
do the talking.

00:06:57,291 --> 00:07:00,583

plenty to say.

Still, not a bad try
for a temple mouse.

114
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:26,875
You've earned a prize.

115

A prize?

116
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:31,000
That's right! A swift death!

117
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,250
In nature, the mighty
beasts get to devour

their prey as a reward
for their strength,

00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:24,166
[ABARI] Spatial Magic:
Different Dimension Sphere.

161
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,750
Ha! Once somebody
has been ensnared

162
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,458
by my Spatial Magic,
they have no hope of escaping

163
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:32,833
unless I decide to release
them from its hold.

164
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:35,791
[VETTO] Dark swordsman
from a foreign land.

165
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:39,666
Yes, that's right, I can tell
you're here by the mana.

166
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,250
Watch from the sidelines
a little longer.

167
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,875
You're going to be my main dish.

168
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:47,208
You'll be steeped
in delicious despair

169
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:49,875
from having seen the deaths
of all your friends.

170
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:52,500
We must do something
to stop this beast.

171
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,666
Or else the temple is done for.

172
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,250
[YAMI]
All right, geezer.

173
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:57,666
[GIFSO]
What is it?

174
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,750
We can't get in there,
but can we still talk to 'em?

175
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:02,500
[GIFSO]
Well, yes. We can.

176
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:05,125
But how will that help them?

177
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:07,375
[YAMI]
Uh, testing one two. Test, test.

178
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:10,083
Oh, my gosh!
That's Captain Yami!

179
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,666
[YAMI]
All right, ya morons. Listen up!

180
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,125
[VANESSA] Hey, Captain!
I actually beat one of them!

181
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:18,875
[YAMI] A nasty character's
just crashed the party.

182
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:21,583
He's one of the Midnight Sun's
high-ranked members.

183
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:23,333
Real wild-lookin' SOB

184
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:26,541
who's as strong as
a Magic Knight captain.

185
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,916
[VETTO laughs]

186
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,333
[ASTA]
He's here?

187
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:35,208
[YAMI] Plus, he's got
four minions with him.

188
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:37,541
I'm gonna need another
helping, please...

189
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:40,750
[YAMI] But some things have
come up, so I can't get to 'em.

190
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:43,333
[FINRAL]
Huh?! What "things" exactly?

191
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:45,000
[YAMI] You block heads
are gonna hafta handle it.

192
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:47,083
You've gotta be kidding me!

193
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:50,041
[YAMI] Now, look.
It's time to get serious.

194
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:51,958
Push past your limits.

195
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:58,416
[YAMI] Die and I'll
kill ya. Over and out.

196
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,750
Great. We're basically doomed.

197
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:02,375
When I proposed
this game of mine,

198
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:05,666
I had no idea it would turn
out to be so exhilarating.

199
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,125
And now here we are,
with the fate

200
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:11,250
of the Underwater Temple
hanging in the balance.

201
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,916
Time for a rule change!

202
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,125
Knights and Mages.

203
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,125
In order to win the game,
you must defeat

204
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:20,416
Team Eye of the Midnight Sun!

205
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,541
All those who contribute
to this victory

206
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:26,083
will have their wishes granted,
insofar as my authority

207
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:29,083
as the high priest
of this temple allows!

208
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:33,208
[ASTA]
We have to fight that monster!

209
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:41,500
Yeah, he's scary. So what?

210
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:44,000
That's exactly what makes
a battle worth fighting.

211
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:48,041
I can do this.
I can take him down.

212
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,958
[KIATO]
Asta!

213
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:53,208
I guess this means that
our fight is on hold.

214
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:54,708
Guess so.

215
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,791
[ASTA]
All right! Let's go!

216
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,291
[KIATO]
Yeah!

217
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:01,666
[VETTO]
Too easy.

218
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:05,083
Now, who's going
to be my next prey?

219
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:06,875
[MAGNA, LUCK]
Where ya goin'?

220
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:09,166
[MAGNA]
Think you can move on

221
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:12,125
to the next fight
just like that?

222
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:15,375
[LUCK] Get back here.
We're not dead yet.

223
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:21,250
Captain Yami gave us
our marching orders.

224
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:23,375
And if our captain says
to take you down,

225
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:25,875
that's what we're gonna do.

226
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:27,458
[LUCK]
You got that?

227
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:29,291
--[LUCK] We're not done!
--[MAGNA] We're not done yet!

228
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,833
[BOTH]
We won't be broken!

229
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:33,666
Excellent.

230
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,625
I shall enjoy bringing you
despair that much more.

231
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,250
The longer the hunt continues,

232
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:41,083
the greater the anticipation
of the kill becomes.

233
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:56,333
[VETTO laughs]

234
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:58,416
[MAGNA]
I'm glad we're still goin'.

235
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,208
But how are we gonna fight
a monster like that?

236
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:04,125
If he lands one more square
hit on us, we're toast.

237
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:05,666
Hey, big guy.

238
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,166
Throw that last attack spell
at us again, will ya?

239
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,166
Huh?!

240
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,000
[LUCK]
Yeah! The super-fast one!

241
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:13,750
[MAGNA] Has all that lightning
finally fried his brain?

242
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:16,000
We barely survived that
one the first time!

243
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:18,500
How're we supposed to live
through a second round?

244
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:21,083
Well, well. We've
got a feisty one.

245
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:25,500
Delicious. Then I'll continue
feeding you despair...

246
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:27,208
...until you choke!

247
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:33,291
[LUCK laughs]

248
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:37,333
You leave yourself open
for just a second.

249
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,416
I thought I saw that before.

250
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,375
And you're fast enough
to take advantage of it.

251
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:44,875
You have keen perception
and incredible speed,

252
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:45,958
I'll grant you that.

253
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,833
Aw, man, my
Thunderbolt Destruction

254
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:49,708
didn't have any
effect on him at all!

255
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:52,291
I can play with you
a while longer.

256
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,625
[LUCK laughing]

257
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:59,000
[VETTO]
He's all over the place!

258

[MAGNA] That crazy
battle freak. Damn him.

266
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:49,708
[LUCK]
It's Magna, right?

267
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:51,833
You've got some
weird-looking hair.

268
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:53,166
What?

269
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,916
I'm Luck. Nice to meet you.

270
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,583
[MAGNA]
Oh, this guy?

271
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:58,208
I think he's that smiling maniac

272
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:01,000
they call Luck the
Cheery Berserker.

273
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:03,791
Looks like I'm gonna have
to show him what's what.

274
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:06,500
Yeah. Nice to meet ya,
too, ya jerk.

275
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:09,000
[MAGNA yells]

276
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,708
Oh, hey. That's a funny face.

277
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:13,041
[laughs]

278
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:14,625
[MAGNA] You've been messin'
around and annoying

279
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:16,875
the crap outta me ever
since the very first day

280
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,000
you joined the squad.

281
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:20,333
Everyone knows you've got more

282
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:22,416
than your share
of personality issues.

283
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,083
[laughs]

284
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,166

And half the time on missions,

288
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:34,708
you're more trouble
than you're worth.

289
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:36,250
--Ha!
--[MAGNA] Huh?

Still, your battle sense...

296
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:58,958
Gotta give it to you there.

297
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,250
[MAGNA] And ever since
that dungeon mission,

298
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:04,708
you've only been
gettin' stronger.

299
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:07,500
You're reckless,
immature, and insane.

300
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:11,333
I hate to admit it, but damn it,
you're my best friend.

301
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,208
That's it.

302
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:19,875
You better not even think about
leavin' me behind, ya jerk!

Hey, nice one, Magna!
Here, lemme help!

308
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:49,333
[LUCK] When we first met,
I didn't take you seriously.

309
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:53,291
A commoner, huh? Boring.

310
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:55,291
But something
told me that behind

311
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:57,083
the weird-looking hair,
there was somebody

312
00:16:57,166 --> 00:17:00,416
truly dangerous.
And entertaining.

313
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,125
[LUCK] I kept messing with you
so I could meet that Magna.

314
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:08,375
Hey, thanks for the
flan. It was tasty!

315
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:11,500
Good, because that's the

You always come right back at me

318
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:16,250
with everything you've got.

319
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:19,416
You never hold anything back.

320
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,916
And now, after all this time,

321
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,166
I finally realized...

322
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:28,000
You were the first
friend I ever made.

323
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:33,708
Hey, Magna! You can do
better than that, can't ya?

324
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:36,125
Shut up!

325

[VETTO yells]

That wasn't a bad catch,
fireball freak.

What? Who're you
callin' a freak?

328
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,000
Now get offa me, Lightnin' Boy.

329
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:52,625
If you two are done playing,
can we finish this?

330
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:54,375
That's it--let's kick
this guy's ass

331
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:55,500
Sure, sounds good to me.

332
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:57,500
We're ready whenever you are!

333
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:59,125
[VETTO chuckles]

334
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:00,583
[ASTA]
This way!

335
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:02,916
How do you know where to go
when you can't sense mana?

336
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,416
I can't sense mana,
but I can sense ki.

337
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,333
Ki? Anyway, you're right.

338
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:09,625
I sense magic power up ahead.

339
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:12,208
And there's a tremendous
amount of it, too.

340
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:15,583
I've never felt anything
like this before.

341
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:18,625
I agree with you that this
is a battle worth fighting.

342
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:21,958
Hey. I was trying to
read your ki earlier.

343
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:24,458
It was almost impossible
to pin you down.

344
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:26,583
How do you do that?

345
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:28,625
Oh, well my dancing
actually puts me

346
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,750
into a kind of trance,
which is a really big help

347
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:32,083
when it comes to fighting.

348
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:33,333
How does it work?

349
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:34,666
My body just sorta moves,

350
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,125
without any conscious
thought on my part.

351
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:38,375
That makes it hard
for my opponent

352
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:39,875
to predict what I'll do.

353
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:42,833
Okay, I get it.
That's really cool!

354
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:44,125
A trance...

355
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:48,458
What'cha doin'?

356
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:50,291
[ASTA]
Putting myself in a trance.

[laughs]

358
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:54,791
Whoa! I can see the magic
up ahead clearly now.

359
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:57,458
Flame mixed with Lightning,
and they're doing battle.

360
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:59,291
Flame and Lightning, huh?

361
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:01,458
That means Magna
and Luck are up there.

362
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:04,500
And as for the massive
power they're fighting...

363
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:06,041
What is this?

364
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,500
It's like hundreds
of wild animals

365
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:09,416
snarling and running crazy!

366
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,958
That's Vetto's magic!

367
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:13,250
Wait, how the heck can
you pick up on all that?

368
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:14,791
Our kind are
particularly skilled

369
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:17,416
at reading magic and the
different forms it can take.

370
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,708
But if that's what we're up
against, then I'm worried.

371
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,041
It's fine!

372
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,583
Those two may be a little
bit on the crazy side,

373
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:25,125
but you can always count on them

374
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:28,375
when things start to get tough.
We'll get outta this alive!

Now are you beginning
to understand?

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,083
Weak animals will be devoured.

380

Their lot in life is to despair.

Would you shut up?

00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:14,250
to pull off a
Crackling Magna Typhoon

in the comfort of your own home.

425
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:18,333
First, get a length of
lightning rope ready, like so.

426
00:23:18,416 --> 00:23:19,541
Are you kidding?!

427

up a rope, Magna.

I can't do that!

give him a push
