00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:15,625
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:18,416
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:24,416
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,000
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,458
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:39,583
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:42,583
[QUEEN OF WITCHES]
Why don't we show them

8
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:44,916
what you really are?

9
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:52,833

[ASTA]
My magic is never giving up!

11
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:09,625
[NARRATOR] The Queen of Witches
removed the limiter

12
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:11,791
on Asta's anti-magic energy,

13
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:14,583
awakening him to
his true potential.

14
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:19,250
[ASTA] What's happening?
My body's chilled to the bone.

15
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:21,916
Like I'm floating
in a freezing lake.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,666
My mind feels clearer than ever.

17
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,291
And my physical strength...

18
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:30,291
...is overflowing!

19
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:33,291
[LADROS groans]

20
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:36,625
[QUEEN OF WITCHES] I'd suspected
you were of a certain bloodline,

21
00:01:36,708 --> 00:01:38,458
but I was wrong.

22
00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:40,500
Due to your body's mutation,

23
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:42,666
the mana did not
dwell within you.

24
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,041
Simply put, you're defective.

25
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:50,250
But because of that,
you're able to hold the sword.

26
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:52,208
You aren't anything special.

27
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:54,375
Not in the slightest.

28
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:58,833
And that is precisely what
makes you extraordinary.

[LADROS screams]

31
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:06,875
[NARRATOR] Asta defeated Ladros
with his newfound power,

32
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:09,125
and Ladros turned
over a new leaf.

33
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:10,791
But then...

34
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:12,541
[QUEEN OF WITCHES]
Yes, my magic allows me

35
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:15,291
to manipulate blood as I please.

36
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:17,791
[QUEEN OF WITCHES]
So, for as long as you live,

37
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:21,083
you're going to carry this
weapon as though it were mine.

38
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:22,541
[NARRATOR] The Queen
of Witches revealed that

39
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:24,791
she'd been after Asta's
anti-magic ability

40
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:29,250
from the start, taking
control over his body.

41
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:32,083
And now for your first order.

42
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:34,708
I want you to kill every
one of these weaklings

43
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:36,875
with your own hands.

00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:17,541
Asta, no.

Asta! Don't do this!

47
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,000
Wake up!

48
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:29,375
Now then, which one of them
would I like to slaughter first?

49
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,500
Ah, yes.

50
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:34,625
It's only proper to
start with royalty.

51
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,041
Kill her.

Don't hurt her!

55
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:47,958
Hey, get ahold of yourself!
This isn't you, Asta!

56
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,833
No use. I can't get
through to him.

57
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:57,708
It's me! Noelle!
I know you remember!

58
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:04,041
Now this is justice.
How fitting.

59
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:06,166
To think that a
Clover Kingdom royal

60
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,833
would be vanquished
by their blade.

61
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:14,750
You can't.

62
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,000
Asta.

63
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:25,083
[VANESSA]
Snap out of it!

64
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,541
[NOELLE]
No! Please stop!

65
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:30,125
[QUEEN OF WITCHES]
It's time to say farewell.

66
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,541
Asta!

67
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,458
Don't listen to her!

68
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:38,041
[QUEEN OF WITCHES]
Do it.

69

[QUEEN OF WITCHES]
Curses. He isn't even conscious!

72
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:01,791
Thank God.

73
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,791
So, despite all of that,
she still doesn't

74
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:06,000
have total control over him.

75
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,458
I won't die.

76
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:14,333
No matter what, I won't
let you kill me!

77
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:19,416
Don't even try!
Once I get myself free,

78
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,083
I can undo this stupid spell!

79
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:24,125
Like it's nothing!

[QUEEN OF WITCHES] Puppet's
Blood binds to the blood

in his body, bending
him to my will.

He can fight it, but
he can never undo it.

83
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:35,666
A magicless neophyte like
him cannot escape its hold.

84
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:47,000
Asta!

85
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:49,083
Oh, dear. So stubborn.

stay here for good.

I will never disobey
you again! So, please!

00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:14,500
[QUEEN OF WITCHES]
No.

[VANESSA gasps]

93
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,791
[QUEEN OF WITCHES] He's going
to kill each of them perfectly,

94
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:22,875
here and now, so that I can
put an end to your defiance.

95
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:25,166
Vanessa, my scrying foretold

96
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,000
that you would someday
come back here alive

97
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:28,916
with something I wanted.

98
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
That's why I didn't
search for you.

99
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:34,333
However, I must admit, I had
not anticipated that this

100
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:37,000
"something I wanted"
would reveal itself to be

101
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:41,083
a human boy wielding
an anti-magic weapon.

102
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:45,958
What did you gain by
fleeing from this forest?

103
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:47,708
You may have shared
a fleeting bond

with these imperfect
worms, but in the end,

105
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,125
it only led them
to their deaths.

No matter where you run,

You are my daughter, after all,
and family lasts forever.

you mean by that?

[WITCHES laughing]

116
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:28,583
I just remembered, there's
a place in that village

Can you please let me go?

Can I go now?

No. I'm certain that you possess
the ability to control destiny.

confirmed as much.

depends on you.
It's simple, really.

Find a spell that
controls destiny.

136

At that time, you may leave.

Remember, Vanessa,
we are family.

There's a big town
outside this forest,

Isn't that where all the
other witches have gone?

and stuff like that?

00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,208
I mean...

162
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:40,833
[VANESSA] I could never
defy the Queen of Witches.

163
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:44,791
[BIRD] Hey, it's all right.
Don't look so sad.

164
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,041
[DOLL]
I know!

165
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,125
Want me to ask the
Queen of Witches for you?

166
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:49,583
That won't work.

167
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:52,833
You're nothing more than a
doll I made using my magic.

168
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:57,000
So if I can't do something,
you certainly can't, either.

169
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:58,541
[DOLL]
That's right.

170
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:03,166
And this whole conversation
is just you talking to yourself.

171
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:08,333
[BIRD] Someday, it would be nice
to have real friends to talk to.

172
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:09,833
Yes, it would.

173
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:13,583
But it'll never happen.
I'm stuck here.

174
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:18,375
Inside this cage, forever.
I'll never be free.

175
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:45,583
[WITCHES shouting, screaming]

176
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:48,583
[VANESSA] I wonder what
all the chaos is about.

177
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:49,625
[WITCH 64E]
It's a man!

178
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,833
[WITCH 64F]
Intruder!

179
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:53,750
[VANESSA]
What did they say?

180
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:09,458
[gasps]

181
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:14,416
--Jeez, relax...
--[VANESSA] Is that a...?

182
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,166
Are they really gonna
chase me outta here

183
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,791
for bein' a man?

184
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,833
[VANESSA gasps]

185
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:26,208
[VANESSA] I've never seen
one of them before.

186
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:28,708
I'll give that hysterical
old hag one thing, though.

187
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:30,833
She really knows how to fight.

188
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:34,083
[VANESSA] Wait, is he saying
he fought the Queen?

189
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:36,583
Now then, where am I?

190
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:39,958
Uh... And what's your story? Why
are you sittin' in a birdcage?

191
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:41,791
Well, sir. I, uh...

192
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:43,375
You see, this is my home.

193
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:46,916
The Queen of Witches locked
me in and I can't get out.

194
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:49,625
Like a pet bird.

195
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:52,791
But you gotta go outside
every once in a while, right?

196
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:55,083
[VANESSA]
I've never left the cage.

197
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:58,125
Not once? Sounds
like a tough life.

198
00:12:58,208 --> 00:12:59,875
But hey, it's your lucky day.

199
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:02,875
There's a hole in the wall.
Now you can sneak out.

200
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:05,125
Oh. Thanks, but...

201
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:07,500
I can't run away
from Her Majesty.

202
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:11,375
I have to stay here.
This cage is my fate.

203
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,041
Your fate? Really?

204
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,958
You're sayin' you ended up
here because it's your fate?

205
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:19,250
Yeah, yeah, old
Mr. Fate, I know.

206
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,666
Man. I'm not a fan of that guy.

207
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,458
Why would anyone obey him?

208
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:26,500
I live how I want, even if
it means kickin' fate's ass.

209
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,250
[VANESSA gasps]

210
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,291
But at the moment, I don't
stand a chance in hell

211
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:33,416
against that crazy old bat
who's got you trapped here.

212
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:38,500
Which means I probably
oughtta make a run for it

213
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:42,125
while I can. Hope it
works out, little birdie.

214
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:44,208
Wait. Don't go!

215
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:48,083
What should I do now?

216
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,875
Well. That's up to you.

217
00:13:57,416 --> 00:14:00,041
[VANESSA]
If I really am a bird in a cage,

218
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:02,625
then I have wings
like a bird, too!

219
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,791
If I want to,

220
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:07,666
I can fly away from all this!

221
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:14,958
It's my choice!

222
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:46,333
[VANESSA]
You wanted to know what I gained

223
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:48,500
from the outside world.

224
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,166
Well, I learned something.

225
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,541
Which is?

226
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:02,916
[VANESSA] You're not my
family, and you never were!

227
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,875
'Cause the Black Bulls
are my family!

228
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:08,708
And now... I'm about to have
them taken away from me,

229
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:11,041
right before my eyes!

230
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,375
[VANESSA]
If I can't put a stop to this,

231
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:19,041
then what good am I to them?

232
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:22,375
Please, if that power
really does exist...

233
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:26,041
Magic of mine, change this fate!

234
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:38,791
What is that?

235
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:52,666
Incredible. She's done it.

236
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:02,875
[QUEEN OF WITCHES]
At last, the red thread of fate!

237
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:05,041
[meows]

238
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:09,625
[meows]

239
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:11,791
In all these years,
I never imagined that

240
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:14,333
it would look like this. A cat?

241
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:17,791
[CAT meows]

242
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:20,541
[QUEEN OF WITCHES]
So, she's discovered the spell.

243
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,875
She really can
manipulate destiny.

244
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:25,916
In that case,
let's give it a try.

245
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:30,625
[grunts]

246
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,333
Asta!

247
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:43,041
[QUEEN OF WITCHES]
Is that all?

248
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:46,541
It touched him, but nothing
seemed to happen.

249
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,875
It's time to pay
for underestimating

250
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:53,208
the great Queen of Witches.

251
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,375
No!

252
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:04,750
[QUEEN OF WITCHES] It appears
you are still imperfect.

253
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:07,791
But not to worry.
In my infinite perfection,

254
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:10,083
I shall see that you
receive proper training

255
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,708
from this point forward!

256
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:13,375
Asta!

257
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:16,541
[QUEEN OF WITCHES gasps]

258
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:20,708
She lives?

259
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:21,958
[QUEEN OF WITCHES]
Impossible.

260
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,333
I was certain he'd slashed
that girl in two!

261
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:27,083
It's time to pay
for underestimating

262
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:29,041
the great Queen of Witches.

263
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:30,375
[QUEEN OF WITCHES]
How strange!

264
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:33,291
Did I not say the same
thing moments ago?

265
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:41,125
He missed!

266
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:43,208
[QUEEN OF WITCHES]
This must be a mistake!

267
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,208
Don't hurt her!

268
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,000
[NOELLE grunts]

269
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:55,458
It's over for you.

270
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,583
Don't hurt her!

271
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:02,916
[QUEEN OF WITCHES gasps]

272
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:12,333
[QUEEN OF WITCHES]
No, this cannot be!

273
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:14,250
Kill that one!

274
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:34,208
[meows]

275
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:36,958
[QUEEN OF WITCHES] Perhaps
striking the cat directly.

276
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:42,875
[QUEEN OF WITCHES gasps]

277
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:52,583
[QUEEN OF WITCHES]
It dispelled Puppet's Blood?

278
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:55,875
But my manipulation
should've been unstoppable!

279
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:57,416
I see.

280
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,583
This is the power that
can control destiny!

281
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:05,041
[QUEEN OF WITCHES] When someone
is touched by that animal,

282
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:08,333
it would seem the spell takes
over that person's fate,

283
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:12,166
altering its course to work
in the caster's advantage!

284
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,416
Vanessa must not
be able to visualize

285
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,000
an outcome in which
her friends are killed,

286
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:19,958
so she imagines scenarios
where my attacks fail

287
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,583
by a narrow margin.

288
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:24,291
The cat is harmless
and unstoppable.

289
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:28,166
Well. How about that?

290
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,166
I'm impressed that you've
realized this power.

291
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,291
[gasps]

292
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:35,333
Vanessa. You've done so well.

293
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:37,541
How I've waited for this day!

294
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:40,625
Blood Magic: Puppet's Blood!

295
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:47,458
[NOELLE]
Vanessa!

296
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:49,625
Now both you and
your newfound ability

297
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,708
will be mine to
command as I please.

298
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,791
It'll be the perfect
enhancement to an already

299
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:56,166
perfect entity such as myself!

300
00:19:58,541 --> 00:19:59,875
[QUEEN OF WITCHES]
Listen well, fate!

301
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:01,916
I am your master now!

302
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:28,000
What the hell?

303
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:31,041
It worked. We're safe.

304
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,583
Zell, my love!

305
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:38,125
You two. Thank goodness.

306
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:40,250
I was so worried!

307
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:51,375
But how? Why?

308
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:54,125
[QUEEN OF WITCHES]
My magic is perfect!

309
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:56,166
There was no possible way
I could have failed

310
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:59,916
to seize control
of that boy! How?

311
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,791
[meows]

312
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:05,375
[VANESSA] So, this is what
you meant when you said

313
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:07,833
that I could control destiny.

314
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:09,708
I don't know too much
yet about this power

315
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:11,083
or how to use it.

316
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:13,958
But, one thing's for certain.

317
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:19,291
[VANESSA] I can already tell
it'll always side with me

318
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:21,833
and those I hold dear.
