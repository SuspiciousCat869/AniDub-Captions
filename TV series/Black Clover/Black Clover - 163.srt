1
00:00:22,554 --> 00:00:25,724
[NARRATOR] Within the clover's
fifth leaf, there lives a devil.

2
00:00:27,225 --> 00:00:29,686
[NARRATOR] Asta, born
unable to harness mana,

3
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:31,438
was granted the
power of Anti-magic

4
00:00:31,521 --> 00:00:33,231
from his five-leaf grimoire,

5
00:00:33,314 --> 00:00:36,693
giving him the ability
to nullify spells.

6
00:00:36,776 --> 00:00:39,320
Unfortunately, the members
of Spade Kingdom's

7
00:00:39,404 --> 00:00:41,448
Dark Triad also possess powers

8
00:00:41,531 --> 00:00:43,867
from the devils of the
underworld and used them

9
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,120
to launch an invasion on
their neighboring countries.

10
00:00:47,203 --> 00:00:49,164
Gaining strength from
his belief in himself

11
00:00:49,247 --> 00:00:51,249
and from the support
of his friends,

12
00:00:51,332 --> 00:00:54,711
Asta continues to fight for
the safety of this world.

13
00:01:00,133 --> 00:01:02,135
[LOROPECHIKA gasps]
Are you ready, Undine?

14
00:01:02,218 --> 00:01:03,720
Of course.

15
00:01:03,803 --> 00:01:06,181
[NARRATOR] The Heart Kingdom was
attacked by the Dark Disciples,

16
00:01:06,264 --> 00:01:09,476
who wielded the power of devils.

17
00:01:09,559 --> 00:01:11,311
Leading this attack was Vanica,

18
00:01:11,394 --> 00:01:13,772
one of the Dark Triad,
who was possessed

19
00:01:13,855 --> 00:01:16,316
by the devil called Megicula.

20
00:01:16,399 --> 00:01:18,902
Meanwhile, after relocating
to the neutral zone

21
00:01:18,985 --> 00:01:21,112
between the Clover
and Spade Kingdoms,

22
00:01:21,196 --> 00:01:23,531
the Black Bulls were
confronted by Dante,

23
00:01:23,615 --> 00:01:26,576
another member of
this evil trio.

24
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:29,371
Spade's attacking us here?

25
00:01:29,454 --> 00:01:30,705
Go, Rouge!

26
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:32,749
[NARRATOR] Vanessa's spell
and Asta's Anti-magic

27
00:01:32,832 --> 00:01:35,293
helped them defend
the hideout momentarily,

28
00:01:35,377 --> 00:01:38,046
but Dante's power was too great.

29
00:01:41,883 --> 00:01:43,593
Have it your way.

30
00:01:43,677 --> 00:01:47,972
Perhaps you'll be more driven
if I appeal to your feelings.

31
00:01:48,056 --> 00:01:51,226
Don't do it!

32
00:01:51,309 --> 00:01:53,019
--[VANESSA] Oh, no!
--[GREY] He hurt Gauche!

33
00:01:53,103 --> 00:01:55,605
[NARRATOR]
Gauche was dealt a mortal blow.

34
00:01:57,107 --> 00:02:00,568
[NARRATOR] Asta's rage and
hatred caused him to go berserk.

35
00:02:00,652 --> 00:02:05,115
[ASTA screaming]

36
00:02:06,908 --> 00:02:10,453
[ASTA growls]

37
00:02:10,537 --> 00:02:13,540
[NARRATOR]
And, finally, he landed a hit.

38
00:02:13,623 --> 00:02:16,126
It seems you've left
a small scratch.

39
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:20,964
You'll regret that.

40
00:02:21,047 --> 00:02:23,883
[yells]

41
00:02:24,926 --> 00:02:28,388
[DANTE] I hate to sully
my hands in worldly fights.

42
00:02:28,471 --> 00:02:30,390
But now...

43
00:02:30,473 --> 00:02:35,478
[DANTE]
Gravity Magic: Heavy Infighting.

44
00:02:35,562 --> 00:02:38,314
I've got an insatiable urge
to beat you to a pulp

45
00:02:38,398 --> 00:02:39,733
with my own two fists.

46
00:02:39,816 --> 00:02:48,324
[yelling]

47
00:02:48,408 --> 00:02:52,078
[GREY]
Gauche. Please don't die!

48
00:02:52,162 --> 00:02:53,747
You have to live!

49
00:02:56,499 --> 00:02:57,959
[GREY]
Please!

50
00:04:29,592 --> 00:04:31,511
[STEPMOTHER] How dare you
show yourself like that

51
00:04:31,594 --> 00:04:34,180
in front of me? You ugly thing!

52
00:04:34,264 --> 00:04:36,349
[coughing]

53
00:04:36,433 --> 00:04:39,269
[STEPMOTHER] Honestly.
My daughters are so beautiful!

54
00:04:39,352 --> 00:04:42,605
But you have to be such a plain
and gloomy little wretch.

55
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:46,067
[STEPSISTER 163A giggles]
You made Mother mad again!

56
00:04:46,151 --> 00:04:48,403
[laughs] Get back to cleaning,

57
00:04:48,486 --> 00:04:50,238
and take care of the
laundry and dishes, too,

58
00:04:50,321 --> 00:04:51,698
while you're at it!

59
00:04:51,781 --> 00:04:52,866
I'm trying.

60
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:54,034
[STEPSISTER 163A]
You're covered in soot.

61
00:04:54,117 --> 00:04:56,745
How disgusting! [laughs]

62
00:04:56,828 --> 00:04:58,121
Then again, your name is Grey,

63
00:04:58,204 --> 00:05:00,206
so it's only right
for you to be dusty.

64
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:03,126
[STEPSISTER 163B]
Yes, it really suits her!

65
00:05:03,209 --> 00:05:04,711
[STEPSISTER 163A]
You should get even dustier,

66
00:05:04,794 --> 00:05:07,589
to cover up how
embarrassingly ugly you are.

67
00:05:07,672 --> 00:05:09,299
[STEPSISTER 163B]
Hah! That's true!

68
00:05:09,382 --> 00:05:10,717
It'll be better
if you walk around

69
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,511
covered in soot all the time!

70
00:05:13,595 --> 00:05:15,722
[STEPSISTERS]
Mother! Look at this!

71
00:05:15,805 --> 00:05:18,433
[STEPMOTHER] My goodness,
that spell is so beautiful!

72
00:05:18,516 --> 00:05:20,143
Just like the two of you!

73
00:05:20,226 --> 00:05:22,937
[GREY]
Next year, I can do that, too!

74
00:05:25,273 --> 00:05:27,650
[GREY yelps]

75
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:31,654
[GREY]
I'm sorry! I didn't mean to!

76
00:05:31,738 --> 00:05:34,240
What are you doing spying
on us, you ugly girl?

77
00:05:34,324 --> 00:05:35,408
She's probably jealous

78
00:05:35,492 --> 00:05:37,786
of the beautiful magic
that we can do!

79
00:05:37,869 --> 00:05:41,039
She's so hideous, she could only
dream of pulling that off!

80
00:05:41,122 --> 00:05:44,918
[STEPSISTERS laugh]

81
00:05:45,001 --> 00:05:47,253
[STEPMOTHER] A laggard like you
isn't capable of magic

82
00:05:47,337 --> 00:05:49,631
that's useful,
let alone beautiful!

83
00:05:49,714 --> 00:05:52,050
Stick to your chores,
am I clear?

84
00:05:52,133 --> 00:05:53,885
Um, yes.

85
00:05:56,012 --> 00:06:01,559
[GREY panting]

86
00:06:08,066 --> 00:06:10,068
[GREY]
I have nothing.

87
00:06:10,151 --> 00:06:13,488
And I always get yelled at
for being a failure.

88
00:06:13,571 --> 00:06:15,448
[gasps]

89
00:06:17,575 --> 00:06:20,412
[GREY] But if I work as hard
as I can, maybe my stepmother

90
00:06:20,495 --> 00:06:23,206
and stepsisters will
change their minds.

91
00:06:25,417 --> 00:06:27,252
[STEPSISTER 163A]
So, you've been sneaking around

92
00:06:27,335 --> 00:06:30,171
and shirking your chores
in favor of practicing magic.

93
00:06:30,255 --> 00:06:32,841
Have you at least learned
any decent spells?

94
00:06:32,924 --> 00:06:34,175
[STEPSISTER 163B]
It's been five years

95
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:36,094
since you got your
grimoire, hasn't it?

96
00:06:36,177 --> 00:06:40,223
Even a dullard like you must've
mastered something by now.

97
00:06:40,306 --> 00:06:43,184
Go ahead, show us
a spell! [laughs]

98
00:06:43,268 --> 00:06:46,021
[laughs] I'm sure it'll
be sad and embarrassing,

99
00:06:46,104 --> 00:06:48,982
just like you are,
but give it your best.

100
00:06:49,065 --> 00:06:50,400
[STEPSISTERS gasp]

101
00:06:52,318 --> 00:06:54,946
Now I can be like you two.

102
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,448
[BOTH gasp]

103
00:06:56,531 --> 00:06:57,949
[gasps]

104
00:06:58,033 --> 00:07:01,369
[BOTH]
How dare you try to imitate us?

105
00:07:01,453 --> 00:07:03,580
We're the ones who were
given these gorgeous faces

106
00:07:03,663 --> 00:07:06,124
by Mother--you have no
right to look this way!

107
00:07:06,207 --> 00:07:08,418
Change yourself back,
right this instant!

108
00:07:08,501 --> 00:07:09,627
[GREY]
I'm sorry.

109
00:07:09,711 --> 00:07:12,005
I haven't learned how
to change back yet--

110
00:07:12,088 --> 00:07:14,341
[STEPSISTER 163A]
Ugh. You repulsive idiot!

111
00:07:14,424 --> 00:07:16,092
[STEPSISTER 163B]
We'll kill you!

112
00:07:17,844 --> 00:07:19,471
[GREY]
I finally learned the spell,

113
00:07:19,554 --> 00:07:23,183
but my magic wasn't
enough to fix things!

114
00:07:23,266 --> 00:07:26,353
If I go back home, who knows
what they'll do to me?

115
00:07:26,436 --> 00:07:30,940
Then again, am I really capable
of living out here on my own?

116
00:07:31,024 --> 00:07:32,484
[BANDIT 163A]
Well!

117
00:07:32,567 --> 00:07:34,903
It's one of you
pretty young things

118
00:07:34,986 --> 00:07:38,281
from the Whiteley family!

119
00:07:38,365 --> 00:07:41,117
You all alone out here?

120
00:07:41,201 --> 00:07:43,453
We're just a trio
of starving bandits.

121
00:07:43,536 --> 00:07:45,538
Can you spare
something to help us?

122
00:07:45,622 --> 00:07:48,750
Uh, I'm sorry.
I don't have any money,

123
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:52,045
so I'm afraid there isn't
anything I can do for you.

124
00:07:52,128 --> 00:07:54,506
[BANDIT 163A]
Well, your family has plenty.

125
00:07:54,589 --> 00:07:56,966
Maybe we can just take you.

126
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,051
[GREY]
I'm helpless.

127
00:07:58,134 --> 00:07:59,177
[BANDIT 163A]
Come on, let's grab her!

128
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,720
[GREY]
Oh, no.

129
00:08:02,222 --> 00:08:04,432
[BANDITS groan]

130
00:08:06,393 --> 00:08:08,812
Nice lady, are you hurt?

131
00:08:08,895 --> 00:08:11,356
Um. I'm fine. Thank you so much!

132
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:13,274
[GAUCHE]
Don't get the wrong idea.

133
00:08:13,358 --> 00:08:14,984
The only reason
I bothered to save you

134
00:08:15,068 --> 00:08:17,570
was because Marie wanted me to.

135
00:08:17,654 --> 00:08:19,989
Isn't she sweet? Good girl!

136
00:08:20,073 --> 00:08:22,367
You really are an angel,
you know that, Marie?

137
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:25,495
My precious,
adorable little angel!

138
00:08:25,578 --> 00:08:27,831
[MARIE] Thank you for
helping her, Big Brother.

139
00:08:27,914 --> 00:08:28,832
[GAUCHE]
Of course.

140
00:08:28,915 --> 00:08:30,542
Anything for you, Marie.

141
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:33,878
[GREY] I didn't know siblings
could be that close.

142
00:08:33,962 --> 00:08:36,381
That's nice. I wish I had...

143
00:08:36,464 --> 00:08:37,966
[GAUCHE]
Hey.

144
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:39,718
What are you doing
out here alone?

145
00:08:39,801 --> 00:08:42,095
[GREY]
Hm? Well, the truth is...

146
00:08:42,178 --> 00:08:44,806
You should probably
go back home now.

147
00:08:46,349 --> 00:08:47,934
[GAUCHE]
You ran away?

148
00:08:49,185 --> 00:08:50,854
If you did it because
of something stupid,

149
00:08:50,937 --> 00:08:52,772
you might as well turn around.

150
00:08:52,856 --> 00:08:55,066
Trust me, you'll never survive
in this rotten excuse

151
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,776
for a world if you
don't have the resolve

152
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,654
to fight tooth-and-nail
for the life you want.

153
00:09:02,532 --> 00:09:05,326
[GREY] Gauche probably
didn't realize it.

154
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:08,204
Up until then, I'd had nothing.

155
00:09:10,206 --> 00:09:12,751
[GREY]
But that was what I needed!

156
00:09:12,834 --> 00:09:14,669
Not long after that...

157
00:09:15,712 --> 00:09:19,466
[YAMI laughs]
You know what, I like you!

158
00:09:19,549 --> 00:09:22,135
Come and join my squad!

159
00:09:22,218 --> 00:09:23,720
[GREY sighs]

160
00:09:23,803 --> 00:09:26,181
What are you standing
around for, newbie?

161
00:09:26,264 --> 00:09:28,224
You should come have
a drink with me!

162
00:09:28,308 --> 00:09:31,478
Hey, Gauche, think you could
be a little more sociable?

163
00:09:31,561 --> 00:09:32,854
No! Leave me alone.

164
00:09:32,937 --> 00:09:34,397
I'm far too busy
burning the image

165
00:09:34,481 --> 00:09:36,733
of my precious Marie
into my retinas.

166
00:09:36,816 --> 00:09:38,234
Ugh. Come on now,

167
00:09:38,318 --> 00:09:41,112
is your sister really the only
thing that interests you?

168
00:09:41,196 --> 00:09:43,365
Of course she is! She's perfect!

169
00:09:43,448 --> 00:09:44,699
Yeah, yeah.

170
00:09:44,783 --> 00:09:46,034
She's an angel!

171
00:09:46,117 --> 00:09:49,412
[sighing]

172
00:09:49,496 --> 00:09:52,082
[GREY]
I was able to see you again!

173
00:09:52,165 --> 00:09:55,585
Maybe I'm going overboard
by calling it fate.

174
00:09:55,669 --> 00:10:00,423
But you were the one who
led me to the Black Bulls.

175
00:10:00,507 --> 00:10:02,300
The place I belong.

176
00:10:06,221 --> 00:10:09,391
[GREY] I don't wanna lose a
single one of my dear friends!

177
00:10:11,267 --> 00:10:15,313
[GREY] You gave me a reason
to keep living. And...

178
00:10:15,397 --> 00:10:18,817
[GAUCHE] No matter what you
look like, you're still Grey.

179
00:10:21,403 --> 00:10:22,737
[GREY]
Because of you...

180
00:10:22,821 --> 00:10:28,284
...I found friends that
I could trust like family!

181
00:10:28,368 --> 00:10:30,286
I want to save you.

182
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:32,997
And... It's embarrassing,

183
00:10:33,081 --> 00:10:35,583
but I want you
to look at me more!

184
00:10:36,668 --> 00:10:39,254
[GREY]
And see how strong I've become!

185
00:10:43,133 --> 00:10:45,135
Grey?

186
00:10:45,218 --> 00:10:46,386
[DANTE]
Ah...

187
00:10:46,469 --> 00:10:48,513
[VANESSA]
She sealed the wound!

188
00:10:48,596 --> 00:10:51,683
I didn't know her Transformation
Magic could do that!

189
00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:56,730
[VANESSA]
What is this spell?

190
00:10:56,813 --> 00:10:58,314
Hey, Grey. How'd you--?

191
00:10:58,398 --> 00:11:00,316
[bang]

192
00:11:04,112 --> 00:11:05,196
[VANESSA]
Asta!

193
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:09,909
[laughs]

194
00:11:09,993 --> 00:11:11,578
Magnificent!

195
00:11:11,661 --> 00:11:15,623
Yet another
arcane-stage fighter.

196
00:11:15,707 --> 00:11:18,710
Your abilities are going
to waste in this place.

197
00:11:18,793 --> 00:11:23,923
It's been decided.
You'll both be my women now.

198
00:11:27,552 --> 00:11:28,678
[YAMI]
Hey!

199
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:34,726
[YAMI] That's my squad,
so keep your mitts off of 'em.

200
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:47,322
[BOTH]
Captain!

201
00:11:47,405 --> 00:11:53,161
Well, then. You must
be Yami Sukehiro.

202
00:11:53,244 --> 00:11:57,082
[YAMI] And you must be a
devil-possessed from Spade.

203
00:11:57,165 --> 00:11:59,626
But I don't give a damn.

204
00:11:59,709 --> 00:12:03,463
Because whoever you are,
I'm about to slaughter you.

205
00:12:03,546 --> 00:12:08,385
[laughs] I like your malice.
That said, you're out of line.

206
00:12:08,468 --> 00:12:09,719
[YAMI gasps]

207
00:12:09,803 --> 00:12:13,139
[DANTE] Gravity Magic:
Presence of the Demon King.

208
00:12:13,223 --> 00:12:14,140
[gasps]

209
00:12:14,224 --> 00:12:15,892
[FINRAL]
I can't control my portal!

210
00:12:15,975 --> 00:12:18,144
[FINRAL yelps]

211
00:12:19,229 --> 00:12:21,690
[YAMI grunts]

212
00:12:21,773 --> 00:12:26,736
Oh? So you refuse to
genuflect! How bold of you.

213
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,281
[YAMI] I've learned a lot
in the last six months.

214
00:12:30,365 --> 00:12:32,575
Time to try it out.

215
00:12:32,659 --> 00:12:36,037
[YAMI]
Mana Zone and Black Hole.

216
00:12:42,335 --> 00:12:45,505
[YAMI]
Dark Magic: Black Moon.

217
00:12:46,881 --> 00:12:48,508
[DANTE]
Interesting.

218
00:12:48,591 --> 00:12:52,929
Any of my magic within
that field is being erased.

219
00:12:53,013 --> 00:12:55,015
So this is Dark Magic.

220
00:12:55,098 --> 00:12:58,226
That's fine.
I'll send this boulder

221
00:12:58,309 --> 00:13:02,814
flying at top speed and
crush you with the inertia!

222
00:13:02,897 --> 00:13:06,192
[YAMI] Dark Magic: Dark
Cloaked, Dimension Slash!

223
00:13:12,449 --> 00:13:14,701
[DANTE]
He cut through space?

224
00:13:16,828 --> 00:13:17,912
[DANTE]
Impressive.

225
00:13:17,996 --> 00:13:21,041
Precisely why I've
been searching for you.

226
00:13:23,126 --> 00:13:28,048
[DANTE] Gravity Magic:
Heavy Infighting Gladiator!

227
00:13:28,131 --> 00:13:29,007
[YAMI]
He's fast.

228
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:30,592
[DANTE grunts]

229
00:13:40,477 --> 00:13:42,729
[YAMI] I'm using Mana Zone
and predicting his moves

230
00:13:42,812 --> 00:13:47,609
by reading his ki.
He's not on Julius's level.

231
00:13:47,692 --> 00:13:51,279
But he can control the speed
of his sword using gravity!

232
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:55,241
[laughs] I was right
about you, Yami Sukehiro!

233
00:13:55,325 --> 00:13:57,702
Have you been stalkin' me
or somethin', you weirdo?

234
00:13:57,786 --> 00:14:00,163
'Cause you're startin' to creep
me out somethin' fierce!

235
00:14:00,246 --> 00:14:02,332
Stalking? Well, you're
the one I'm after,

236
00:14:02,415 --> 00:14:03,667
so I suppose so!

237
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,502
Look, pal. It's gonna
be hard for me

238
00:14:05,585 --> 00:14:06,795
to take that as a compliment

239
00:14:06,878 --> 00:14:08,672
when it's comin' from
the likes of you!

240
00:14:08,755 --> 00:14:12,050
You are a key that connects
this world to the underworld.

241
00:14:12,133 --> 00:14:13,093
[gasps]

242
00:14:13,176 --> 00:14:14,678
[YAMI]
Underworld?

243
00:14:14,761 --> 00:14:15,804
[YAMI]
Take that creepy crap

244
00:14:15,887 --> 00:14:18,765
and shove it where
the sun don't shine!

245
00:14:18,848 --> 00:14:20,266
My, what a shame.

246
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,644
I wasn't expecting
Yami Sukehiro to be

247
00:14:22,727 --> 00:14:24,854
so vulgar and shabby in person.

248
00:14:24,938 --> 00:14:26,189
[YAMI]
Say that again!

249
00:14:26,272 --> 00:14:28,316
[DANTE] How did a slob
like you manage to recruit

250
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,152
so many talented warriors?

251
00:14:31,236 --> 00:14:34,280
I've never been jealous
of a human before.

252
00:14:34,364 --> 00:14:37,033
Thank you for inspiring
this new malice.

253
00:14:37,117 --> 00:14:40,954
In any case, those arcane-stage
ladies are coming with me.

254
00:14:41,037 --> 00:14:44,791
They're going to serve my ends
from now on, not yours!

255
00:14:44,874 --> 00:14:46,376
[BOTH]
Captain Yami!

256
00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:47,919
[YAMI]
If they're "arcane-stage,"

257
00:14:48,003 --> 00:14:50,380
then that's the first
I've heard about it.

258
00:14:50,463 --> 00:14:51,715
And they're not here
to serve me.

259
00:14:51,798 --> 00:14:54,509
I just brought 'em on
because I liked 'em.

260
00:14:54,592 --> 00:14:57,387
[YAMI]
Mana Zone: Condense.

261
00:15:05,353 --> 00:15:06,730
[DANTE yells]

262
00:15:11,401 --> 00:15:14,112
[YAMI]
Dark Cloaked, Iai Slash.

263
00:15:14,195 --> 00:15:16,781
[YAMI]
They're not goin' anywhere.

264
00:15:16,865 --> 00:15:19,492
Not with you, y'damn freak.

265
00:15:19,576 --> 00:15:21,119
[DANTE groans]

266
00:15:24,497 --> 00:15:26,833
[MAN 163A]
The enemy's attacking! Run!

267
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:29,210
[MAN 163B] The queen's water
should stop the fire!

268
00:15:29,294 --> 00:15:30,587
[MAN 163C]
Over here!

269
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,172
[MAN 163D]
Hurry!

270
00:15:32,255 --> 00:15:33,006
[LOROPECHIKA]
What?

271
00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:35,133
This can't be.

272
00:15:45,393 --> 00:15:47,187
[LOROPECHIKA] I knew they
had the devil's power,

273
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:50,148
but they're stronger
than I expected!

274
00:15:50,231 --> 00:15:52,275
I'll go do what I can.

275
00:15:52,359 --> 00:15:53,485
[LOROPECHIKA]
Gaja!

276
00:15:54,694 --> 00:15:57,280
[LOROPECHIKA] If the Spirit
Guardians don't stand a chance,

277
00:15:57,364 --> 00:16:00,158
then everyone else is doomed!

278
00:16:00,241 --> 00:16:01,701
We have to stop
Luck and the others

279
00:16:01,785 --> 00:16:04,120
who just left to provide backup!

280
00:16:04,204 --> 00:16:05,372
[NOELLE]
Loropechika!

281
00:16:05,455 --> 00:16:07,957
Don't worry, I'm sure
they'll be fine.

282
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:10,960
You should concentrate on
protecting your kingdom.

283
00:16:12,379 --> 00:16:15,298
[NOELLE] The queen is absolutely
essential, not just

284
00:16:15,382 --> 00:16:19,260
for protecting Heart, but for
attacking Spade, as well.

285
00:16:19,344 --> 00:16:21,971
We'll protect you,
no matter what it takes!

286
00:16:22,055 --> 00:16:24,015
[NOELLE] I don't care
how strong they are.

287
00:16:24,099 --> 00:16:27,477
I won't let us
be beaten. No way!

288
00:16:29,396 --> 00:16:32,691
[SVENKIN cackles] That was
one of the Heart Kingdom's

289
00:16:32,774 --> 00:16:34,651
elite Spirit Guardians?

290
00:16:34,734 --> 00:16:37,862
How disappointing.
But not surprising, I guess.

291
00:16:37,946 --> 00:16:39,781
Of course I'm more powerful.

292
00:16:39,864 --> 00:16:42,117
I'm lady Vanica's
right-hand man.

293
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,661
With 50 percent
of the devil's power.

294
00:16:44,744 --> 00:16:46,955
One of the Dark Disciples.

295
00:16:47,038 --> 00:16:50,417
None other than the
Great Svenkin Getard!

296
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,877
Looks like I've still got
some clean-up to do.

297
00:16:52,961 --> 00:16:54,295
[sceams]

298
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,008
[SVENKIN gasps]
What's this?

299
00:17:00,385 --> 00:17:02,470
Well, what d'ya know?
A cute little kid's

300
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:04,556
come out to play with me.

301
00:17:04,639 --> 00:17:07,851
Hm? You're not from
this kingdom, are you?

302
00:17:07,934 --> 00:17:10,520
You should probably run on
back to where you belong.

303
00:17:10,603 --> 00:17:12,063
Heck no.

304
00:17:13,356 --> 00:17:14,774
--Huh?
--[LUCK grunts]

305
00:17:18,695 --> 00:17:21,239
[SVENKIN] I like your speed,
but it's not enough.

306
00:17:21,322 --> 00:17:24,284
Goodbye, kiddo!

307
00:17:24,367 --> 00:17:26,369
[LUCK grunts]

308
00:17:26,453 --> 00:17:29,456
[LUCK] Lightning Magic:
Thunderbolt Destruction!

309
00:17:30,957 --> 00:17:34,336
[laughs] Nice try, but with my
magic, I can change the shape

310
00:17:34,419 --> 00:17:36,171
and hardness of my skin.

311
00:17:36,254 --> 00:17:38,965
I transform it as needed
to nullify the effects

312
00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:41,176
of my opponents' spells.

313
00:17:41,259 --> 00:17:42,677
With its various capabilities,

314
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:45,638
my body's the ultimate
spear and shield!

315
00:17:45,722 --> 00:17:48,183
No matter what you try...

316
00:17:48,266 --> 00:17:50,352
...you stand no chance
in this fight!

317
00:17:53,521 --> 00:17:55,732
I'm way into the zero stage,

318
00:17:55,815 --> 00:17:57,984
and you're first
stage at the most.

319
00:17:58,068 --> 00:18:01,321
Fast or not, there's no way
you're going to beat me.

320
00:18:01,404 --> 00:18:03,823
You should use that speed
of yours to run away.

321
00:18:03,907 --> 00:18:06,659
[coughs] Why would I
want to run away?

322
00:18:06,743 --> 00:18:08,620
This is way too much fun.

323
00:18:08,703 --> 00:18:11,748
Oh, I get it now:
you're young and stupid.

324
00:18:11,831 --> 00:18:13,124
[LUCK]
What are you doing here?

325
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:14,751
Why attack the Heart Kingdom?

326
00:18:14,834 --> 00:18:19,923
[chuckles] I would do anything
my Lady Vanica asked of me.

327
00:18:20,006 --> 00:18:21,049
No woman can beat her

328
00:18:21,132 --> 00:18:23,093
when it comes
to power and beauty.

329
00:18:23,176 --> 00:18:26,638
She is an idol, someone to
be worshipped and obeyed!

330
00:18:26,721 --> 00:18:29,224
Huh. So you'll go
around hurting people

331
00:18:29,307 --> 00:18:30,684
because she wants you to?

332
00:18:30,767 --> 00:18:33,144
That's reason enough
for me. And you?

333
00:18:33,228 --> 00:18:35,230
Why put your life
on the line for strangers,

334
00:18:35,313 --> 00:18:37,065
people who aren't even
from your country?

335
00:18:37,148 --> 00:18:39,776
Just look at how beat-up and
bloody you are, little guy.

336
00:18:39,859 --> 00:18:41,861
You're pretty selfish,
stealing others' happiness

337
00:18:41,945 --> 00:18:43,822
to impress someone.

338
00:18:43,905 --> 00:18:46,116
[ASTA] You go ahead and do
what you gotta do, Luck,

339
00:18:46,199 --> 00:18:49,119
but so will I, got it?

340
00:18:49,202 --> 00:18:53,039
[LUCK] I'll do what I've
gotta do and protect them.

341
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:57,752
[LUCK]
I'll do it.

342
00:18:57,836 --> 00:19:00,088
Because I'm a Magic Knight!

343
00:19:01,756 --> 00:19:03,049
[LUCK]
Hey, Gaja.

344
00:19:03,133 --> 00:19:04,884
Can you show me how to do
the true Lightning Magic

345
00:19:04,968 --> 00:19:06,344
that you use?

346
00:19:06,428 --> 00:19:08,847
[GAJA] As the name
suggests, it is a spell

347
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:11,182
that produces a
real lightning bolt.

348
00:19:11,266 --> 00:19:12,976
I am a Spirit Guardian,

349
00:19:13,059 --> 00:19:15,895
and it still took me
two years to learn it.

350
00:19:15,979 --> 00:19:19,566
Aw, too bad, it seemed
like a whole lotta fun.

351
00:19:19,649 --> 00:19:22,277
[GAJA] As an expert at discharge
spells, I'm well-suited

352
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,903
to that kind of technique.

353
00:19:23,987 --> 00:19:27,032
I would say that your strength
lies with equip spells, however.

354
00:19:27,115 --> 00:19:29,409
You have the ability
to instantly form arrays

355
00:19:29,492 --> 00:19:31,494
near your hands and your feet.

356
00:19:31,578 --> 00:19:33,413
Use that to your
advantage and create

357
00:19:33,496 --> 00:19:36,332
your own uniquely
powerful spell.

358
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:37,667
[LUCK]
Hm...

359
00:19:41,546 --> 00:19:43,840
I don't care how fast
or determined you are,

360
00:19:43,923 --> 00:19:46,468
it won't help you now. [laughs]

361
00:19:46,551 --> 00:19:48,178
Your magic is useless against me

362
00:19:48,261 --> 00:19:52,807
and you're in bad shape,
so why not give up? Seriously.

363
00:19:54,976 --> 00:19:58,938
Oh, come on. It's never
gonna work, kid.

364
00:19:59,022 --> 00:20:01,483
My skin can detect
your mana, you know.

365
00:20:01,566 --> 00:20:05,111
It reacts automatically
to protect me from harm.

366
00:20:07,364 --> 00:20:09,574
[SVENKIN] He ditched a
piece of his armor, huh?

367
00:20:09,657 --> 00:20:12,452
A clever thing to do,
I'll give you that much.

368
00:20:12,535 --> 00:20:16,706
In exchange, I'll show you
how clever I can be.

369
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,958
[SVENKIN]
Skin Magic: Skin Fort!

370
00:20:19,042 --> 00:20:21,586
Magic Shells for all!

371
00:20:22,629 --> 00:20:25,465
[LUCK]
Faster. Faster.

372
00:20:25,548 --> 00:20:28,051
You're a tough one, aren't you?

373
00:20:28,134 --> 00:20:31,721
[SVENKIN] Your mana won't
hold out much longer, though.

374
00:20:31,805 --> 00:20:33,765
Don't worry. When
you exhaust yourself,

375
00:20:33,848 --> 00:20:36,393
I'll give you the
treatment you deserve.

376
00:20:36,476 --> 00:20:40,271
[LUCK]
More. Faster.

377
00:20:40,355 --> 00:20:43,400
[SVENKIN] What? How did
he inflict that much damage?

378
00:20:43,483 --> 00:20:46,695
Is he moving faster than my
skin's ability to sense mana?

379
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,407
In that case,

380
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:51,741
I'm just going to
make my defense

381
00:20:51,825 --> 00:20:53,952
even harder to get through.

382
00:20:54,035 --> 00:20:55,495
Let's see how badly
you can hurt me

383
00:20:55,578 --> 00:21:01,042
now that I'm as solid
as a rock wall. [laughs]

384
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:03,378
[LUCK]
More.

385
00:21:03,461 --> 00:21:04,671
Wait. Hold on.

386
00:21:04,754 --> 00:21:06,548
Something isn't
right about this.

387
00:21:06,631 --> 00:21:08,758
Just what are you up to, brat?

388
00:21:08,842 --> 00:21:10,301
[LUCK]
More.

389
00:21:11,845 --> 00:21:13,680
My skin magic will
stand up against

390
00:21:13,763 --> 00:21:15,598
anything you can throw at me!

391
00:21:15,682 --> 00:21:17,017
[LUCK]
Faster!

392
00:21:18,435 --> 00:21:21,438
[SVENKIN] Whatever you're
doing won't work!

393
00:21:21,521 --> 00:21:24,482
[LUCK]
True Lightning Magic: Ceranos!

394
00:21:26,401 --> 00:21:28,236
[groaning]

395
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:30,530
[SVENKIN]
He went through me?

396
00:21:30,613 --> 00:21:33,116
But there's no way.

397
00:21:33,199 --> 00:21:34,826
Did he use that spell
to turn himself

398
00:21:34,909 --> 00:21:37,704
into a bolt of actual lighting?

399
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:41,833
That was fun.
Thanks for the fight!

400
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:16,928
[FULL CAST]
Clover Clips!

[GREY]
Today's the day.

404
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:33,361
[GREY] I'm going to thank
him for what he did.

405
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:34,362
Hey.

406
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:36,656
[yelps]

407
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,116
[GREY]
Today's the day.

408
00:23:38,199 --> 00:23:40,326
Look. Isn't she the cutest?

409
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:41,494
[GREY]
Today's the day.

410
00:23:41,578 --> 00:23:43,163
So cute it hurts.

411
00:23:43,246 --> 00:23:44,581
[GREY]
Today's the day.

412
00:23:44,664 --> 00:23:45,707
Cute, right?

413
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:46,833
[GREY]
Today's the day.

414
00:23:46,916 --> 00:23:48,251
Cute, right?

415
00:23:48,335 --> 00:23:50,920
[VANESSA] They seem to be
doing that a lot lately.

416
00:23:51,004 --> 00:23:52,339
I wonder what it's about.

417
00:23:52,422 --> 00:23:54,507
Nice communication, guys.

418
00:23:56,843 --> 00:23:58,345
[LUCK]
That was awesome!

419
00:23:58,428 --> 00:24:00,221
I wonder what everyone
else is up to.

420
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:02,932
If they don't hurry, I'll
beat everyone here myself.
