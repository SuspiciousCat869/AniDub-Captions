161
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,000
Please, brother.

162
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,041
[GAUCHE]
Marie.

163
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:52,166
[MARCO]
Hey! Over here!

164
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,208
[MARIE gasps]
It's Marco!

165
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,625
I was worried about you!
I'm glad you're okay.

166
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:58,750
I was real scared,

167
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,666
but then Sister
and Asta showed up.

168
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,041
I knew they would
come to rescue us!

169
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,208
Hey, kid! Where'd you get
that robe you're wearing?

170
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:07,208
It's Asta's.
He let me borrow it!

171
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,416
I was afraid of being alone
while he and Sister

172
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,250
came here to save
the other kids.

173
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:14,916
But he told me it's full
of Magic Knight courage.

174
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,958
I'm sure I'll be safe enough
if I wait out here with Marco.

175
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:19,791
You go back and help the others.

176
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:23,291
Don't worry I won't let
anything bad happen to Marie!

177
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:26,208
[GAUCHE] You better not,
you sad excuse for a bodyguard.

178
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:29,000
Or something equally bad will
happen to you, I promise.

179
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:30,666
[MARCO]
Um...

180
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,291
[MARIE]
Big brother!

181
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:33,166
[BOY 33C]
Oh!

182
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,083
Marco!

183
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:35,583
Marie!

184
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:36,791
[MARIE]
You're here!

185
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:39,500
I'm glad you're okay!

186
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,000
Sister got us out using
her awesome flame magic.

187
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:44,041
She and Asta are still
back there fighting,

188
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,250
but the monster's really strong!

189
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:47,666
It's fine, you'll see!

190
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,916
My big brother's gonna
go and help them.

191
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
He and Asta are in the
same Magic Knight squad,

192
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,583
so they have to stick together.

193
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,291
[CHILDREN]
Wow.

194
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:56,708
[GIRL 33B]
The same as Asta?

195
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,666
[GIRL 33C]
Then he must be super strong!

196
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,583
[MARIE]
Yeah!

197
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:03,541
Marie, you better keep
yourself well hidden.

198
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:05,250
Right!

199
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,208
[MARIE]
Big brother.

200
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:10,166
[CHILDREN]
Good luck!

201
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,125
[GAUCHE]
Asta this, Asta that...

202
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:17,916
What's so great
about him, anyway?

203
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,916
The captain, the other
squad members,

204
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
they're all crazy
about this kid.

205
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,458
But he was basically
useless back there.

206
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,500
He and the old hag
have probably given up

207
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,375
and made a run for it by now.

208
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:29,750
When you get down to it,

209
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:32,125
people will always put
themselves ahead of others.

210
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:34,666
That's just the way
the world works.

211
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:37,833

[panting, coughing]

214
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:52,166
No. Not yet. I'm not done!

215
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,208
[GAUCHE gasps]

216
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,375
You don't know
when to quit, huh?

217
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:56,916
Just forget about
protecting them

218
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,500
and let me capture you already.

219
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,416
We'll have so much fun!

220
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,750
[ASTA]
Forget about protecting them?

221
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:06,291
No way. Never. Not a chance!

222
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,541
You would have to kill me first!

223
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:11,916
[GAUCHE]
Is he insane? Or just an idiot?

224
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:19,666
[ASTA]
Forget about protecting them?

225
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:23,166
No way. Never. Not a chance!

226
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,875
You would have to kill me first!

227
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:26,125
[roars]

228
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:27,833
Which isn't gonna happen,

229
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:29,666
because there's
no way I'm gonna die

230
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,375
before I become the Wizard King!

231
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,375
Quick, Asta! On your right!

232
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:34,083
[ASTA]
Crap!

233
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:35,291
[yelps]

234
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:36,416
You know, for someone who was

235
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,375
going on and on about
not dying today,

236
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:40,583
it sure did look like
you were about to.

237
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,083
Gauche, you came back!

238
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:44,708
Why'd you run away in
the first place, you jerk?

239

--[GAUCHE] Shut it!
--[ASTA screams]

240
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,958
I wasn't running away.

241
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:52,333
I just needed to get
Marie to safety.

242
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:55,458
So, the idiot decided to
come back and help after all.

243
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:57,625
[GAUCHE]
I'll take you on myself!

244
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:59,375
No, you can't!

245
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:02,500
Been there, tried that.
It didn't work!

246
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:05,666
I'll fight the best that I can.

247
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,416
So Marie will love me.

248
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,458
And then she'll be proud
of her big brother again!

249
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,958

Go, Real Double!

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,458
[GAUCHE]
Any time we cut part of it off,

254
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:36,666
more magic pours in
and repairs the damage.

255
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:42,000
Pretty frustrating, huh?

256
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:45,083
[GAUCHE] I haven't even
scratched that woman.

257
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:49,000
This is my worst pairing
since the captain.

258
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:51,000
Should I play my trump card?

259
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:54,125
No. No matter how strong
my Mirror Magic becomes,

260
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:55,875
it won't work.

[ASTA yells]

265
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:17,000
Why'd you go after it
alone like that?

266
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:19,583
We're supposed to be
in this together!

267
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,750
We're squadmates and
friends, aren't we?

268
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:23,000
And that means, when we fight,

269
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:25,041
I protect you and
you protect me.

270
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:27,833
Then nobody can take
either of us down!

271
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:31,833
That's what I call
a foolproof strategy!

[ASTA laughs]

273
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:37,916
[GAUCHE] That's what I call
a sloppy strategy.

He really is an idiot.

Although...

276
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:44,458
I knew someone else
who fought sloppy.

[GAUCHE panting]

278

So, you still wanna fight?

'Cause I can tell ya right now,
you're done running.

[YAMI]
Oh, really?

Well, if she's that
important to you,

come and join my squad.
Pay's pretty decent.

284

You want me to join
a Magic Knight squad?

285

think needs protecting.

help someone someday.

I don't get why, but Marie would
be heartbroken if you died.

doin' me a favor, here.

As your senior squad member,
I will be treated with respect.

Hold on. What's happening?

00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:46,541
[laughs] Cool! What was that?

321
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,958
Some kind of flying
Anti-Magic slash thing?

322
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:51,833
How did you do it?
Tell me, tell me!

323
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:53,958
[GAUCHE] If we're going
to defeat this thing,

324
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:55,666
we need to hit it hard
all at once,

325
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,958
faster than it can regenerate.

326
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,541
Our best bet would probably

327
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:04,083
be Asta's slash attack, but even
that doesn't hit fast enough.

328
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:05,458
[GAUCHE gasps]

329
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:09,333
[GAUCHE] What if... I use my
magic on someone else?

330
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:10,958
[NARRATOR]
Gauche, who had spent his life

331
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:13,916
distrusting others and always
preferred to work alone,

332
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,041
had never before
imagined using his magic

333
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,833
to support somebody else.

334
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:21,583
But from his desperation
to win back Marie's love,

335
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:25,791
his grudging acceptance
of Asta came forth.

336
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:28,875
A fundamentally similar,
yet entirely different spell,

337
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:31,875
inscribed on a new page
in his grimoire,

338
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,583
and not a moment too soon.

339
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:34,916
[GAUCHE]
Good!

340
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,708
But I don't have enough
magic power to cast this.

341
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:39,833
Hey, old hag!

342
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:43,125
Buy me some time
to renew my mana.

343
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:45,583
--Please!
--[gasps] You cad.

344
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:48,666
Ordering an old lady
around like that.

345
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:52,583
I won't be able to hold out for
very long, so make it snappy!

346
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:56,541
You've used up
all the good stuff,

347
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:58,750
and what's left just
isn't gonna cut it.

348
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,708
It's your turn to play, Asta.

349
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:02,791
Do your slash thing again!

350
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:05,708
[ASTA] Yeah, trust me.
I would if I could.

351
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,750
Aw! Party pooper.

352
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,083
Man.

353
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:16,833
[GAUCHE]
I've kept it hidden,

354
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:19,958
but using it now may be
our only way out of this.

355
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:20,958
[GAUCHE]
Asta!

356
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,250
What's up?

357
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:24,708
[GAUCHE]
Look at me!

358
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:27,416
[GAUCHE]
My left eye has been replaced

359
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,416
with a Mirror Magic tool.

360
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:33,833
I'll use the power stored
inside to cast my new spell.

361
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:38,250
Mirror Magic: Mirage Brigade!

362
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:41,125
[ASTAS yelling]

363
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:42,541
Go!

364
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:49,041
[ASTAS yelling]

365
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:56,333
[ASTAS yelling]

366
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:59,375
[ASTAS]
Mirror Slash!

367
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:05,291
[ASTAS]
Not yet! Not yet! Not yet!

368
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,875
[gasps]

369
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:11,541
[ASTA]
I'm not done!

370
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:12,416
[BARO groans]

371
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,458
[SALLY yelps]

372
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:21,541
[laughs]

373
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:25,041
[BOTH]
We did it!

374
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:27,791
[SISTER THERESA] Incredible.
They combined their magics?

375
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:30,416
Whatever they did, it looks
like they were finally

376
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,541
able to drain the power
out of that creature.

377
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:42,416
Goodbye, brother.

378
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,916
[sobbing]

379
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,875
[BARO]
Jeez, you're such a crybaby.

380
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:50,875
How much longer are you gonna
keep up the waterworks?

381
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:53,083
Here, I guess you can have this.

382
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:56,458
[NEIGE gasps]
Thanks, brother Baro!

383
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:02,250
I swear.

384
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:05,250
I'll hate her forever for
turning you into that monster.

385
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:06,583
And me?

386
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:08,833
How can I forgive myself
for blindly following you

387
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:10,541
and doing whatever
you ordered me to do,

388
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:12,958
no matter how awful it was?

389
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:16,750
What you said before was right.

390
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:19,875
I have to take responsibility
for the things I've done.

391
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,291
I'll do it.

392
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:24,416
I will atone for my sins,
and for my brother's, too.

393
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,250
Good, and once you get
that outta the way,

394
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,791
you and I should be friends.

395
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:30,166
With all the cool
magic you can do,

396
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,666
I bet you're gonna be
a pretty popular guy.

397
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,291
Huh?

398
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,541
That would be...

399
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,583
[gasps]

400
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:52,166
It's that bright light again!

401
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:55,666
[GAUCHE]
So much... magic power...

402
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,208
I've never felt anything
this huge bef--

403
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:05,000
[GAUCHE]
I didn't see anything.

404
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:06,541
What happened?

405
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:07,958
[SISTER THERESA]
Another one?

406
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,875
Haven't they done
enough damage already?

407
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,875
Asta!

408
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:20,458
[gasps]

409
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:28,125
No! Old hag!

410
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:29,625
[ASTA]
Sister!

411
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:33,000
[LICHT]
You have injured my compatriot.

412
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:35,250
It's only fair that
I return the favor.

413
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:38,000
It's him! The guy we saw
at the group's hideout!

414
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:41,125
I haven't introduced
myself yet, have I?

415
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:44,791
I am the leader of the
Eye of the Midnight Sun.

416
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,916
Call me Licht.

417
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,291
[ASTA]
No. No way.

418
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:55,166
[ASTA] Just like Yuno's.
A four-leaf clover grimoire!

[FULL CAST]
Clover Clips!

[GAUCHE]
"Marie's in Danger."

421
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:41,000
[GAUCHE]
And-a one, two, three.

422
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:43,000
How to say "no" to an angel!

423
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:45,541
As much as I like
to spoil Marie,

424
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:48,375
I must sometimes harden my heart
and decline her requests,

425
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:50,750
no matter how angelically
she makes them.

426
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:52,750
Like so:

427
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:53,916
Hey, big brother,

428
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,666
please go back to
help Sister and Asta!

429
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,958
[GAUCHE]
No. You'd be in danger if I did.

430
00:23:00,041 --> 00:23:01,208
Hey, big brother!

431
00:23:01,291 --> 00:23:04,625
I want some rice gratin
with hot, melty cheese.

432
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:07,041
[GAUCHE] No! Your tongue
would be in danger.

433
00:23:07,125 --> 00:23:09,208
It would get burned.

434
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:11,583
Hey, big brother,
can we stay out here

435
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:13,166
in the sun all day?

436
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:15,041
[GAUCHE]
No! Your skin will be in danger

437
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:18,208
if you stay out in
full sun too long!

438
00:23:18,291 --> 00:23:20,458
UV rays are a mighty foe!

439
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:23,500
Hey, big brother, show me
a super cool spell!

440
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:26,000
No! Wait, yes!

441
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:29,375
[GAUCHE]
Marie, look at me.

Big brother, you're awesome!

444
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:40,416
[GAUCHE]
Uh-oh. Now I'm in danger!

445
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:42,875
[MARIES]
Hey, big brother?

00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:45,166

of the Midnight Sun's hideout!

448
00:23:49,833 --> 00:23:52,500
You attacked the Clover Kingdom,
and Captain Fuegoleon!

449
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:54,500
You won't get away with it!
