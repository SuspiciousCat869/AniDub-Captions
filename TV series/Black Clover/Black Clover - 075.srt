1
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:15,666
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,541
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:24,416
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,000
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:35,583
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:39,750
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,208
[NARRATOR] The Royal Knights
is an elite team

8
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:45,625
of warriors chosen from
only the most capable

9
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:48,166
Magic Knights in all
of the Clover Kingdom.

10
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:51,416
And the selection exam
was finally underway.

11
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,041
Asta, Mimosa Vermillion,
and the mysterious

12
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:56,416
mage who called
himself Xerx Lugner

13
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,166
were among the first to
battle in the tournament.

14
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,000
[MIMOSA, ASTA gasp]

15
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:01,958
[ASTA]
What the--?

16
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:05,250
[NARRATOR] For some reason,
Xerx made no attempt to fight.

17
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:07,416
So Asta and Mimosa
were forced to charge

18
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,958
into enemy territory
on their own.

19
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:10,708
Do it now!

20
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:13,375
[NARRATOR] Just as victory was
starting to look impossible.

21
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:16,000
Xerx's Trap spell was
activated, bringing about

22
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:18,458
a surprising comeback
for Asta's team!

23
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:24,375
[NARRATOR] As for the contenders
in the second battle...

24
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:25,750
My, what an eyesore.

25
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:27,833
I'll thank you not to
interfere with the splendor

26
00:01:27,916 --> 00:01:30,583
of the magnificent
Kirsch Vermillion!

27
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:03,500
[KIRSCH]
Ah, woe is me.

28
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,375
Why must this wretched
world be overrun

29
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:08,625
with such aesthetically
unpleasing creatures?

30
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:11,208
And why was I cursed
to be born so beautiful

31
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:15,000
amongst this pile
of ugliness? Tragic.

32
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:17,500
[ASTA]
I don't get this guy!

33
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:19,041
Just shut up!

34
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,041
It's bad enough to think you're
better than everyone else,

35
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:23,000
but you could at least
keep it to yourself!

36
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:26,000
Ah! Please don't fret,
my homely friend.

37
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:27,416
--Wha...?
--[KIRSCH] I understand

38
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,750
that you envy my dashing
good looks as anyone would,

39
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:33,125
but it isn't your fault
that you're ugly.

40
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:35,875
You can't just go callin'
people ugly, ya pretty-boy!

41
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:38,875
And I'm not ugly! Are you crazy?

42
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:41,416
No one in the world is
as beautiful as Char is!

43
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,375
You're just a nasty,
narcissistic, disgusting man!

44
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:46,833
Oh, my.

45
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:49,625
Such lowly words must never
pass the lips of a maiden,

46
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:52,000
regardless of how utterly
baseless they are.

47
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:55,625
What a shame, you almost have
the potential to be pretty.

48
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,583
If you modeled yourself
after my example,

49
00:03:57,666 --> 00:04:00,041
you could improve your
appearance quite a bit.

50
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:03,250
[ASTA] He does know they're
supposed to be teammates, right?

51
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:06,000
Mimosa! It's good to see you!

52
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:09,541
Have you come to gaze
upon my glorious face?

53
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:12,666
Be careful not to get sick
from an overdose of beauty!

54
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,958
Thanks for your concern,
but you're making me feel sick

55
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:17,375
for a different reason.

56
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,333
How can you say such words?

57
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:21,833
Can you not comprehend
my splendor?

58
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:24,875
Are you ill?
Allow me to heal you!

59
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:27,250
You're the one who's
ill, big brother.

60
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,875
If I'm being honest,
I hope you lose this battle.

61
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:32,916
Come, now. You
shouldn't make jokes.

62
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,375
You've never been
very good at it.

63
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:35,916
Really?

64
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Yes, jokes are to be told
with elegance and grace!

65
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:41,125
In other words, they should be
beautiful, like yours truly!

66
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:44,416
[ASTA] Mimosa's older
brother sure is unique.

67
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,625
Not sure if that's
a good thing or not.

68
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:47,916
It seems like she's
havin' a hard time

69
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,083
dealing with him, though.

70
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,583
[KIRSCH]
Hm?

71
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,916
Oh, hey, it's nice to meet ya!
Mimosa's been a big help--

72
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:59,208
And you must be that
commoner boy, Asta.

73
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:00,541
That's me.

74
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,916
Don't you dare speak
to me so casually,

75
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,166
you speck of dirt.

76
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,833
[ASTA]
Whoa! His eyes just went dead!

77
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,875
[KIRSCH]
I can't bear the sight of you.

78
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:12,750
Your aura is far from beautiful.

79
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:14,250
Your presence, unsightly.

80
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:15,208
[ASTA groans]

81
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:16,250
[KIRSCH]
Clothes, dirty.

82
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:17,333
[ASTA groans]

83
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:19,083
[KIRSCH]
And those muscles are grotesque.

84
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:20,708
[ASTA groans]

85
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,791
The human form is
designed to be beautiful

86
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:27,916
exactly as it is, you idiot.
There's no need to train it.

87
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,541
Such a thing is for the weak.

88
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,416
Uh...

89
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,458
Well yeah, I was pretty
wimpy a long time ago.

90
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:37,458
It's hard not to be when you
don't have any magic power.

91
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:39,000
That's why I worked so hard!

92
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:41,833
My muscles may be ugly,
but they're my weapons!

93
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:47,375
[chuckles] We're born with
a predetermined capacity

94
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,833
for magic power,
and that's that.

95
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,000
No matter what ugliness
we stoop to in our struggle

96
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:54,666
to change it,
we can never do so.

97
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,083
Predetermined? I don't...

98
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:59,833
[KIRSCH] Your brains are
as repulsive as your face.

99
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:02,458
How did a disgraceful
commoner such as you

100
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,250
even come to be a Magic Knight?

101
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:05,541
Good luck, Kirsch!

102
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:08,208
I do want you to win
this battle, after all!

103
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:11,333
Mimosa! What a sweet sentiment!

104
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:14,291
Does this mean you've recognized
my gorgeousness at last?

105
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,166
No, I'm just looking
forward to the chance

106
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,083
for me and Asta to obliterate
you beyond recognition.

107
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:20,291
Do your best!

108
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:24,708
Oh. Obliterate. Ah.

109
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:27,416
It's such a beautiful
choice of words!

110
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,458
[YUNO]
That guy is flashy.

111
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:31,666
Even from here,
he's blinding me.

112
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,500
Yeah, he's a little much.

113
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:36,541
His name's Kirsch Vermillion.
Mimosa's older brother.

114
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:39,000
Every bit as creepy
as he is annoying.

115
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:40,875
That's no way to introduce him!

116
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:43,625
That man's the Vice Captain
of the Coral Peacocks!

117
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:45,166
Show some respect!

118
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,791
Despite the way he looks,
I hear he essentially runs

119
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,625
the squad by himself these days.

120
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:51,583
Since their Captain,
Dorothy Unsworth,

121
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:53,125
is perpetually napping.

122
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:55,291
You said "despite the
way he looks." That means

123
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:57,541
you think he's a fashion
disaster, too, right, Specs?

124
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,041
Yeah, Specs agrees with us.

125
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:00,791
Glad you're with us, Specs.

126
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:03,666
That's not what I think!

127
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,041
Well, a little.

128
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:08,625
How much longer must I wait?
Bring on the next match!

129
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:10,708
I'm so restless,
I can't bear it!

130
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:12,416
Then let's begin.

131
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,541
[EMCEE MAGE]
For the next fight:

132
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:16,166
Team C: Kirsch, Sol, and Magna,

133
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,166
versus...

134
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,708
...Team D: Cesc,
Adrian, and Willy!

135
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:22,041
Round one, match two. Go!

136
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:24,916
[MAGIC KNIGHTS cheer]

137
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,916
Prepare to be overwhelmed
by my magnificent visage!

138
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,416
[BOTH]
Shut your trap!

139
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,875
We should get back
to the waiting area

140
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:33,791
so we can cheer
for Magna's team!

141
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:37,000
[MIMOSA] Oh, gosh. Asta's
so close to me right now.

142
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:38,750
[ZORA]
Someone's cocky.

143
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,791
You do realize that the
next team they're gonna

144
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:43,708
be up against if they
win is us, right?

145
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:45,375
--[ASTA] Xerx.
--[ZORA] Uh?

146
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,916
That stuff you were
sayin' after the match.

147
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,666
About how you're
not here to win,

148
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,958
but you have a purpose in mind.

149
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:55,916
I said I was lying.

150
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,625
Come on, no more secrets.

151
00:07:57,708 --> 00:07:59,500
You may get on my nerves,
but we're still fighting

152
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:02,083
on the same team,
and you're strong!

153
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:03,583
If all three of us
work together,

154
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:06,708
I know we have what it takes
to win this tournament!

155
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:07,958
[MIMOSA]
Asta.

156
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:12,416
[laughs] Fine, I'll let
you be the decoy again.

157
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,458
No, that's not what I meant
when I said "working together"!

158
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,375
[ZORA]
They're starting.

159
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,958
Have some of this, buddy!

160
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:26,208
Flame Creation Magic:
Grand Slam!

161
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:27,958
You guys want some more?

162
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,875
Good. 'Cause here it comes!

163
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:31,375
I'm gonna march
straight over there,

164
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:32,875
smash the crystal
into smithereens,

165
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,916
and take home the win.
How's that for a strategy?

166
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:39,958
That's it, now you're talking!

167
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:42,208
That's some impressive
magic ability!

168
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:44,458
A Junior-Ranked
Fifth-Class Knight.

169
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:47,083
A peasant like him has no
business being that brazen.

170
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:49,250
He's certainly off the list.

171
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:53,166
Okay, Copper Magic!
Pursuing Jackals!

Bad dog! Get back!

00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:02,000
Hah! Let's see
how you like this!

175
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,250
Hey!

176
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,666
Come over here and fight
me yourself, ya coward!

177
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,166
Come on!

178
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,125
My magic'll burn you to a crisp,
and your little dogs, too!

179
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:11,291
--[KIRSCH] Phew.
--What the--?

180
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:14,125
Mowing everything
down indiscriminately...

181
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:15,875
You've no style to speak of.

182
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:18,041
Where the hell did
you come from?

183
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:21,708
[KIRSCH chuckles]
You're trying too hard at this.

184
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:23,500
There's no reason to
act haphazardly when

185
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:26,625
you have proficiency in both
short- and long-range spells.

186
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,416
The mana weeps for you.

187
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,791
What'd you say?

188
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:32,041
Get a stronger read on
your opponent's magic,

189
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:34,333
almost surrendering to it.

190
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:37,708
Then you can launch the right
attack for the distance.

191
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,791
If you can master that,
your flame will burn

192
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:41,791
much more beautifully!

193
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:44,291
Uh...

194
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,541
[MAGNA] Different spells
for different ranges, huh?

195
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:50,541
Okay. So I just gotta
stop tryin' too hard

196
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,791
and surrender to their mana.

197

[gasps, yelps]

00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:16,000
[MAGNA]
Gotcha!

204
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,166
How's that?

205
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,000
Wait, where'd that
little showoff go now?

206

[SOL] Earth Creation Magic:
Raging Mother Goddess!

207
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:23,791
Outta my way!

208
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:26,041
I'm doing my part to make
the Blue Rose Knights

00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:29,208
get a higher rank
so Char'll be happy!

[WILLY]
Mud Binding Magic: Flashbog!

211
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:34,791
Sorry, miss, but I'm afraid
it won't be that easy.

212
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:36,458
My bottomless mud
will swallow up

213
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:37,958
you and your golem!

214
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:40,708
How'd he get there? Aw, crap.

215
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:44,083
Such a simple method of attack
is an affront to my eyes!

216
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:45,333
What?

217
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:46,958
[KIRSCH] Your Creation
spell generates golems

218
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:49,375
that can follow orders, yes?

219
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:52,000
Our strategy does not
involve distracting our foe

220
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:54,250
with this garish
thing's wasteful size.

221
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:55,958
[SOL]
You watch your mouth!

222
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:58,458
Why not break it up into
five smaller golems

223
00:10:58,541 --> 00:10:59,958
to cause them confusion?

224
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:04,000
An ambush from underground
is also an attractive option.

225
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:07,083
Your creative mana should
be capable of that.

226
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:11,458
Uh, sure. 'Kay!

Less power, more speed!

Your mud will never
catch up with them now!

230
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:23,375
This isn't fair.
I'm outnumbered!

231
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,125
And since I've been
guarding the crystal,

232
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:28,500
it remains untouched
and flawlessly beautiful!

All right. This I can work with!

[KIRSCH] In this world,
there are but two great crimes.

Failing to radiate
beauty in every way...

262
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,500
[MAGNA, SOL]
...and failing to notice beauty!

263
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,833
[MAGNA] All right, we got
through it somehow!

00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:55,541
[SOL] He's a pain, but I'm
still glad he's here!

There's a lot more to that guy
than I thought there was!

Still creepy, though.

How the heck are we
supposed to beat him

269

when we get to the second round?

270
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:08,083
You know, perhaps
the greatest crime

271
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:10,625
is my unbridled handsomeness.

272
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:17,666
Tell me the truth.

273
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,458
What did you think
of our battle?

274
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:21,375
Egregiously beautiful, yes?

275
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:24,333
[MAGIC KNIGHTS]
That's right. Of course.

276
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:25,500
[SEKKE]
Ha, ha...

277
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:27,583
[MAGNA]
Why did I go along with that?

278
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:29,541
[SOL]
I'm so ashamed.

279
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:31,333
That flower spell.

280
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:33,791
The initial phase of it
allowed him to create copies

281
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:36,000
of himself to confuse the enemy.

282
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:38,791
Then, a storm of petals
scattered across the field,

283
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:39,833
obscuring their vision

284
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:42,125
and scrambling their
magic detection.

285
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:44,166
Once that was done,
it gave his team

286
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,541
a path to the crystal.

287
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,708
A feat like that could
only be possible

288
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:50,416
with the enormous magic power
possessed by royalty!

289
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:54,000
Oh, dear. I'm so
beautiful it scares me.

290
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,541
Now I understand
why Kirsch Vermillion

291
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:59,416
is the most likely candidate
to succeed Dorothy Unsworth

292

as Captain of the
Coral Peacocks!

293
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,041
He's still weird, though.

294
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,791
Well!

295
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:06,375
[ASTA]
Did you see that?!

296
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:08,458
Your brother was
incredible out there!

297
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:11,041
You two are obviously siblings!

298
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:13,250
I wish you wouldn't say that.

299
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:17,458
Silence, filth. Your
shrieking pollutes the air.

300
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:19,375
Now it's your turn to face me.

301
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:23,041
Too bad you're a cracked vessel
that can't hold a drop of power.

302
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:26,041
My lovely spells will
smash you to pieces.

303
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,458
Oh, yeah?

304
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,125
Well, I'm not worried, 'cause
I've used a lotta bowls

305
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:31,000
with cracks in 'em, and they
can still hold stuff,

306
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:32,958
even if it spills a little!

307
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:34,125
That's not...

308
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,250
Aw, you've used a lot
of cracked bowls.

309
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,083
Must be because
you were so poor.

310
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:39,416
How unsightly.

311
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,250
No, wait, that's not the point!

312
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:44,041
Sister Lily bought that
bowl for us to eat out of!

313
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:45,416
Even though it's
got cracks in it,

314
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,250
it's the symbol of the love
that she and I share,

315
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,041
and it means the
whole world to me!

316
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:50,416
And I'm gonna use it forever!

317
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,916
You just try and stop me!

318
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,916
Calm down, it was
just a metaphor.

319
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,041
Your brains really are useless.

320
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,541
Nuh-uh!

321
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:59,166
Now it's time to begin
the third match

322
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,583
of the first round!

323
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:03,291
[EMCEE MAGE] Team E:
Finral, Leopold, and Hamon,

324
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:06,250
versus Team F:
Borja, Kyle, and Gaston!

325
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:08,041
I can't wait to heat
up my Flame Magic

326
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:10,291
so that our team can smoke
out the competition!

327
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,166
And attacking them
with my Glass Magic

328
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:15,875
is sure to add a touch of
grace and sophistication!

329
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,750
Watching the way Kirsch
conducted himself

330
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,541
in that last battle gave me
a real spark of inspiration!

331
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:23,041
Why don't we try to fight
beautifully as well?

332
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:25,208
I don't give a crap
about bein' beautiful!

333
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:26,708
Forget your "spark
of inspiration."

334
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:28,291
I'm bringin' a
full-blown inferno.

335
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:30,541
Besides, that guy
kinda creeps me out.

336
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:34,875
[FINRAL] No. You should leave
our attack strategy to me.

337
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:37,500
My magic will help
us move swiftly.

338
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:39,916
We should make use of it.

339
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,541
I haven't fought
alongside the Black Bulls

340
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,166
all this time for nothing.

341
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:48,375
[FINRAL] There's no way
I'm gonna lose now!

342
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,291
--[HAMON] Hm...
--[LEOPOLD] Hot damn!

343
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:53,166
You're rarin' to go,
huh? I like that!

344
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,833
I'm sure you'll bring
out the best in us!

345
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:02,458
[GASTON] Leopold and Hamon
are skilled fighters.

346
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:04,750
[GASTON]
Go after the Black Bull!

347
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:08,083
[LEOPOLD]
Like I'm gonna let that happen!

348
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:09,541
[LEOPOLD yells]

349
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:14,416
[LEOPOLD] He's right, that
Spatial Magic's pretty handy!

350
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,500
[GASTON grunts]

351
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:19,333

[LEOPOLD yells]

357
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:41,541
[BORJA] They've been trying to
cause friendly fire all along!

358
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:42,958
And on top of that,

359
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:46,166
I have a serious
weakness to Flame Magic!

360
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,666
That portal user has a good eye

361
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,833
for what works on
this battlefield.

362
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:53,250
[HAMON] He assesses the area
and drops us in the spot

363
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,583
where our spells are
most advantageous!

364
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:56,750
[KYLE gasps]

[yelps]

367
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:05,416
[HAMON] To think the Black
Bulls had an ace like him

368
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,000
up their sleeve!

369
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:10,666
Why did they keep him
under wraps for so long?

370
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,041
[LEOPOLD]
Now's my chance to attack

371
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:14,625
with all the power I've got!

372
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:19,291
Flame Magic: Spiral Flames!

373
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:22,333
[EMCEE MAGE]
Crystal destroyed! Team E wins!

374
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,833
Got it! Whew!

375
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:27,875
[FINRAL] I'm glad we won,
but that was nerve-wracking!

376
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:30,958
[HAMON]
Finally! Now a delicious meal!

377
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:32,500
There's nothing like it!

378
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,500
And It'll bring us
closer together!

379
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:36,416
A meal, huh? Okay!

380
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,458
I say we make it a competition
to see who can eat more!

381
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,125
Count me in, pal!

382
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:45,166
I don't think my stomach
can take that right now.

383
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:49,791
Woo! Wow, Finral!

384
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:51,125
You were awesome out there!

385
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:52,625
That was great.

386
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:55,833
That Spatial Magic guy's
a force to be reckoned with.

387
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:57,750
[MAGIC KNIGHT 75A]
And he's just a Junior Knight?

388
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:59,166
[MAGIC KNIGHT 75B]
Yeah, all the Black Bulls

389
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,166
taking this exam are Juniors!

390
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,083
[GARETH]
I guess I underestimated them,

391
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,541
because they're
strong for the level

392
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,208
of experience they have.

393
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:08,291
Their squad must've really
stepped up this year!

394
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,250
[LANGRIS] Not bad for
the one who brought shame

395
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,416
upon the house of Vaude.

396
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,958
But I'm about to show
everyone how different we are.

397
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:18,166
It's time to continue
on to the fourth battle

398
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:22,166
of the first round! Team G:
Langris, Fragil, and Sekke,

399
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:25,291
versus Team H:
Gareth, Simon, and Medio!

400
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:26,833
--Ha, ha.
--[SEKKE] No, no, no,

401
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,125
this is all wrong!

402
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:30,583
Everyone here's so much
stronger than me.

403
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:33,458
I should've known I was still
too green to take this exam!

404
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:35,875
But Captain Jack said he
wants to give the small fry

405
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:39,000
a chance, so it's kind of his
fault for pressuring me!

406
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:40,666
This is a huge problem!

407
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,291
How did I get picked for this?

408
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:43,958
I mean, I volunteered,
but still!

409
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:47,041
I can't be held responsible
if I fail, right?

410
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:48,916
[FRAGIL]
Are you okay there?

411
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Ha, ha?

412
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:51,416
All the Knights
from the Black Bulls

413
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,916
are Junior level, but they've
been really successful.

414
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,208
I'm sure you're just
as good as they are.

415
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:57,375
Ha, ha!

416
00:18:57,458 --> 00:19:00,375
You've seen right
through me. What to do?

but you leave me no choice.

419
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,125
Ha! I think I'll start by
making a grand and glorious

420
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:12,666
entrance on my
Sekke Shooting Star!

421
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,875
That sounds like
an excellent plan.

422
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:22,291
Our team's crystal's
now completely covered

423
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:23,541
with a barrier spell.

424
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,958

to destroy it now.

Ha, ha.

It's too bad that you'll
never be anything

00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,000
Well, I'm lucky to
get personal training

472
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:03,541
from Captain Yami every day!

473
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:06,041
Really, what kinda training
do you do with him?

474
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:08,166
For example, after we eat...

475
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,916
If he's patting
his belly like that,

476
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,541
it can mean only one thing!

477
00:23:14,625 --> 00:23:16,541
You must need to
use the bathroom!

478
00:23:19,083 --> 00:23:21,625
[FINRAL] I'd know that
angry knock anywhere!

479
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:24,958
That's the signal you're
out of toilet paper!

480
00:23:25,041 --> 00:23:27,916
Then there's... newspaper time!

481
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:31,125
Your bath time coffee milk!

482
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:34,000
I'll give you the usual.

483
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:35,750
A rugged look that
says "I didn't shave,

484
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:37,541
but I didn't not shave!"

485
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,291
And that's pretty much it.

486
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:40,750
Wow! Cool!

487
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:43,000
Kinda sounds like the
Captain's using him.

488
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:45,166
Uh-huh.

489
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:47,708
