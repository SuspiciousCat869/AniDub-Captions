The Clover Kingdom.

00:00:24,139 --> 00:00:26,516
In this place where
magic is everything,

3
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:29,477
there lives one boy who
was born without it.

4
00:00:29,561 --> 00:00:31,688
His name is Asta.

5
00:00:33,064 --> 00:00:34,524
[NARRATOR]
His strength and determination

6
00:00:34,607 --> 00:00:36,860
helped him become
a Magic Knight.

7
00:00:36,943 --> 00:00:39,529
And despite the many
challenges he faces,

8
00:00:39,612 --> 00:00:43,658
he aims for the top
and refuses to give up!

9
00:00:43,742 --> 00:00:45,285
Rich or poor,

10

royalty or commoner,

11
00:00:47,495 --> 00:00:50,331
Asta believes anyone can shine.

12
00:00:50,415 --> 00:00:53,335
His mission is to prove
that to the whole world,

13
00:00:53,418 --> 00:00:56,129
and to become the
next Wizard King!

14
00:00:57,714 --> 00:01:00,300
[NARRATOR] The Black Bulls
traveled to Raquey for training,

15
00:01:00,383 --> 00:01:03,136
hoping to fortify
their magic skills.

16
00:01:03,219 --> 00:01:04,929
There, Asta and Noelle reunited

17
00:01:05,013 --> 00:01:07,515
with Kahono and Kiato,
and were called upon

18
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:11,102
to solve a problem that was
brewing under the waves.

19
00:01:11,186 --> 00:01:13,938
A Guardian of the Sea
had gone on a rampage,

20
00:01:14,022 --> 00:01:17,942
posing a deadly threat to the
people of the Underwater Temple.

21
00:01:18,026 --> 00:01:20,403
Noelle and a few of the
others took to the water

22
00:01:20,487 --> 00:01:22,280
to quell the chaos.

23
00:01:28,495 --> 00:01:30,121
[NOELLE]
I'll keep getting stronger, Mom.

24

getting started.

[NARRATOR]
But...

26
00:01:34,918 --> 00:01:37,003
Noelle wasn't the only
member of the Black Bulls

27
00:01:37,087 --> 00:01:39,422
who had vowed to
become stronger.

What is this?

31
00:01:51,351 --> 00:01:52,519
Apparently these foods

32
00:01:52,602 --> 00:01:55,605
are supposed to
explosively enhance mana.

33
00:01:55,689 --> 00:01:56,815
Sounds interesting.

34
00:01:56,898 --> 00:01:58,858
I didn't know you could
make food like that!

35

All right, down the hatch.

Not sure what you
expect to happen,

37
00:02:02,195 --> 00:02:03,863
since you don't have any magic.

38
00:02:03,947 --> 00:02:06,408
I dunno, maybe it'll make
my anti-magic better somehow.

39
00:02:06,491 --> 00:02:08,201
It's worth a try, right?

40
00:02:08,284 --> 00:02:10,203

glistens even brighter!

[CHARMY]
Thank you!

00:05:00,707 --> 00:05:04,127
[JAMO]
So, what's the end goal, here?

67
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:06,838
[CHARMY] Well, you see, sir,
my magic allows me to cook meals

68
00:05:06,921 --> 00:05:10,175
that recover a person's mana,
but that isn't enough!

69
00:05:10,258 --> 00:05:11,426
I need to whip up something

to be an easy task.

Hope you're ready to
work hard, shortcake.

[JAMO] These sheep cooks
are your magic,

79
00:05:39,245 --> 00:05:41,998
but you can't simply work
on making them stronger.

80

That isn't going to give you
the result you're after.

81
00:05:45,543 --> 00:05:48,338
The only way to make that happen
is to put aside your magic

82
00:05:48,421 --> 00:05:51,132
and concentrate on training
beyond your physical limits,

83

So whatever this is,
it'll enhance everyone's mana?

Um, why do I have
to be a part of this?

106
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:32,859

00:09:34,356 --> 00:09:35,523
[gasps] Magna?

159
00:09:35,607 --> 00:09:38,943
I dunno why, but my body
feels really weak now.

160
00:09:39,027 --> 00:09:39,778
[ASTA]
Luck!

161
00:09:39,861 --> 00:09:41,780
It's draining away our mana!

162
00:09:41,863 --> 00:09:44,157
How is this even possible?

163
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,659
That's what makes demon
food such a deadly threat.

164
00:09:46,743 --> 00:09:48,745
It absorbs mana from
everyone in the vicinity

165
00:09:48,828 --> 00:09:51,247
until it becomes unstoppable!

166
00:09:51,331 --> 00:09:52,916
No, really, who are you?

167
00:09:52,999 --> 00:09:55,752
I worked so hard on those noms.

168
00:09:55,835 --> 00:09:59,464
[YAMI] Hey, kid!
Quit daydreamin', already.

169
00:09:59,547 --> 00:10:03,009
That thing is usin' mana and
you've got an anti-magic sword.

170
00:10:03,093 --> 00:10:06,221
Do you need me to
spell it out for you?

171
00:10:06,304 --> 00:10:07,681
It's just that...

172
00:10:09,599 --> 00:10:12,769
Fine. Guess I'll
take care of it.

173
00:10:12,852 --> 00:10:14,646
I'd like to think I could
count on my squad

174
00:10:14,729 --> 00:10:16,272
to clean up their own messes,
but here we are--

175
00:10:16,356 --> 00:10:17,899
[ASTA]
No, don't!

176
00:10:19,109 --> 00:10:20,985
[YAMI]
You wanna explain yourself?

177
00:10:21,069 --> 00:10:23,238
Captain, we can't
just destroy the food

178
00:10:23,321 --> 00:10:25,657
Charmy worked so
hard to make us!

179
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,326
Hey, wait, that's
right, it's food!

180
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:30,704
Yeah, I thought
we covered that.

181
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:34,082
[CHARMY]
Please, Asta...

182
00:10:36,251 --> 00:10:38,795
Stop it! You have to!

183
00:10:42,048 --> 00:10:43,758
Okay!

184
00:10:43,842 --> 00:10:46,511
[roars]

185
00:10:46,594 --> 00:10:47,929
[YAMI]
Is he gonna--?

186
00:10:48,013 --> 00:10:52,017
[ASTA yells]

187
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,977
This meal was a
labor of love,

188
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,271
and I'm not gonna
let it go to waste!

189
00:10:56,354 --> 00:10:57,522
[ASTA grunts]

190
00:11:03,319 --> 00:11:05,822
That'll come out of
both ends later!

191
00:11:08,366 --> 00:11:12,037
[YAMI]
Feels like my mana's recharging.

192
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,373
Oh, yeah, it's flowin' out
of the part he's gnawin' on!

193
00:11:15,457 --> 00:11:19,461
[CHARMY] Not so fast, Asta!
I'm not letting you eat it all!

194
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:25,759
Bet you want a piece of the
action, too, don't you, buddy?

195
00:11:25,842 --> 00:11:27,344
Obviously!

196
00:11:27,427 --> 00:11:28,720
All right, I want
the rest of you

197
00:11:28,803 --> 00:11:30,138
to help them polish it off;

198
00:11:30,221 --> 00:11:32,474
it shouldn't take too long
if all of you contribute.

199
00:11:32,557 --> 00:11:34,017
But I'm just the transport!

200
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,477
[NOELLE]
And this is beneath me!

201
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,271
[MAGNA, LUCK yell]

202
00:11:42,067 --> 00:11:45,195
Dude. Who are you?

203
00:11:53,244 --> 00:11:55,872
And there ya go.
Good job, fatsos.

204
00:11:55,955 --> 00:11:58,541
[NOELLE]
They did it to themselves.

205
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:01,294
Hey, I meant to tell you.

206
00:12:01,378 --> 00:12:02,962
I feel like that
food was different

207
00:12:03,046 --> 00:12:05,131
than what you usually cook,
and I don't just mean the part

208
00:12:05,215 --> 00:12:06,549
where it tried to kill us.

209
00:12:06,633 --> 00:12:08,009
Huh?

210
00:12:08,093 --> 00:12:10,929
It's kinda hard for me to
put into words, but I dunno,

211
00:12:11,012 --> 00:12:12,639
it seemed like the
only reason you made it

212
00:12:12,722 --> 00:12:14,599
was to build up our mana.

213
00:12:14,683 --> 00:12:16,810
When I eat your food,
I can usually taste how much

214
00:12:16,893 --> 00:12:19,437
you care about making
people happy and stuff.

215
00:12:19,521 --> 00:12:21,189
It just felt like that
was missing this time.

216
00:12:21,272 --> 00:12:22,440
[CHARMY whimpers]

217
00:12:22,524 --> 00:12:26,069
Uh! Whoa, that came out
really rude. I'm sorry!

218
00:12:26,152 --> 00:12:27,404
Master?

219
00:12:27,487 --> 00:12:29,698
[JAMO]
Hm... That's a good point.

220
00:12:29,781 --> 00:12:31,491
In our quest to cook
the perfect meal,

221
00:12:31,574 --> 00:12:34,994
we forgot the most important
thing about being a chef.

222
00:12:35,078 --> 00:12:37,622
Charmy... No, I mean, shortcake!

223
00:12:37,706 --> 00:12:39,207
One more try!

224
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:41,001
[CHARMY]
I'm ready, sir!

225
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:54,723
Let's do it again!

226
00:12:54,806 --> 00:12:56,182
Here goes!

227
00:12:57,642 --> 00:13:00,145
[ASTA]
Hah!

228
00:13:00,228 --> 00:13:01,646
Gimme another!

229
00:13:03,815 --> 00:13:07,902
[GORDON] Lately, I spend most
days surrounded by friends.

230
00:13:07,986 --> 00:13:10,572
I'm extremely happy,
possibly happier

231
00:13:10,655 --> 00:13:14,325
than I've ever been in my life.

232
00:13:14,409 --> 00:13:16,745
Our battle with the devil
is fast approaching,

233
00:13:16,828 --> 00:13:18,830
and we have to win.

234
00:13:18,913 --> 00:13:23,043
If we fail, then our
happy days will be over.

235
00:13:23,126 --> 00:13:25,003
[ASTA] Well, I thought that
last one was pretty good!

236
00:13:25,086 --> 00:13:26,880
[GORDON]
Asta.

237
00:13:26,963 --> 00:13:30,300
Do you think that I could
train with you for a little bit?

238
00:13:30,383 --> 00:13:32,093
Yeah, of course you can!

239
00:13:32,177 --> 00:13:34,137
Hey, Noelle, is it cool
if Gordon tags in for ya?

240
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,723
[NOELLE]
Uh, sure.

241
00:13:36,806 --> 00:13:38,808
Gimme everything you got!

242
00:13:38,892 --> 00:13:40,101
[GORDON]
Okay.

243
00:13:40,185 --> 00:13:41,603
[GORDON]
My best?

244
00:13:41,686 --> 00:13:46,107
I didn't plan to do that,
but I'm sure Asta can handle it.

245
00:13:46,191 --> 00:13:48,026
All right, here I go.

246
00:13:48,109 --> 00:13:51,780
[GORDON] Poison Curse Magic:
Dwelling of the Poison Cloud.

247
00:13:51,863 --> 00:13:53,323
[ASTA growls]

248
00:13:56,576 --> 00:13:57,660
[gasps]

249
00:14:01,706 --> 00:14:04,376
[ASTA]
Oh, sorry, Gordon! Are you okay?

250
00:14:04,459 --> 00:14:09,005
As I expected.
I'm no match for you.

251
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,181
[GORDON]
I was fighting with all I had.

252
00:14:20,225 --> 00:14:22,852
[GORDON] Maybe I've been
getting weaker of late.

253
00:14:24,312 --> 00:14:27,732
[GORDON] When I first met
the team, I was truly alone.

254
00:14:28,733 --> 00:14:30,110
[GORDON]
But that was largely because

255
00:14:30,193 --> 00:14:33,321
I was as sharp as a knife,
and I refused to let anyone

256
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:35,740
get close to me.

257
00:14:35,824 --> 00:14:39,077
And now... I've lost my edge.

258
00:14:48,253 --> 00:14:49,921
[GORDON]
I love it here with my friends,

259
00:14:50,005 --> 00:14:52,090
but I can't remain complacent.

260
00:14:52,173 --> 00:14:53,717
If we're going to
defeat the devil,

261
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,970
I must regain the strength
I had in the past.

262
00:14:59,097 --> 00:15:02,976
[GORDON] And that means I've got
no choice but to be alone again.

263
00:15:11,985 --> 00:15:15,238
[GORDON] Lady Mereoleona sure is
powerful, and she got that way

264
00:15:15,321 --> 00:15:17,866
by walking through a strong
magic region on her own

265
00:15:17,949 --> 00:15:19,451
when she was young.

266
00:15:19,534 --> 00:15:22,829
So I'll cross the Forest
of Poisonous Magical Beasts,

267
00:15:22,912 --> 00:15:25,373
near the Forest of Witches.

268
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:28,251
I thought it over, and
the strong magic region's

269
00:15:28,335 --> 00:15:31,796
a little too scary for me,
so I'll stick with this.

270
00:15:33,131 --> 00:15:36,760
[GORDON sighs]
Things are going well so far.

271
00:15:36,843 --> 00:15:39,888
I knew living my life alone
was the best idea.

272
00:15:39,971 --> 00:15:43,933
Okay, time for a break.

273
00:15:44,017 --> 00:15:46,186
I'm a little hungry.

274
00:15:46,269 --> 00:15:47,437
Huh?

275
00:15:49,397 --> 00:15:52,442
[MONKEYS chatter]

276
00:15:52,525 --> 00:15:57,280
That's my food for
the whole week! Wait!

277
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,542
[GORDON]
I still can't find my bag.

278
00:16:09,626 --> 00:16:11,419
Maybe I'll go home now.

279
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:14,172
I've probably been
alone long enough.

280
00:16:15,757 --> 00:16:19,511
[GORDON] Uh-oh. I don't
know how to get back.

281
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,021
[GORDON] Eating by yourself
isn't as good.

282
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:34,109
[GORDON] Our meals together
were always loud and rowdy,

283
00:16:34,192 --> 00:16:36,986
but I had fun.

284
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,655
I really wish
my friends were here

285
00:16:38,738 --> 00:16:40,615
to help me get through this.

286
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:46,871
[GORDON]
Don't worry, Gordon!

287
00:16:46,955 --> 00:16:49,624
I'll find you something
to snack on right away!

288
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,751
We're the G-G Guys, remember?

289
00:16:51,835 --> 00:16:53,795
Pull yourself together, buddy!

290
00:16:53,878 --> 00:16:57,382
You look so tired,
it's scary! Eek!

291
00:16:57,465 --> 00:17:00,635
Be tough like me, dude.
I know you can do it!

292
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:03,430
Forget Magna,
I'm gonna kill you!

293
00:17:04,973 --> 00:17:07,976
[GORDON] Great, I'm already
starting to go crazy!

294
00:17:08,059 --> 00:17:10,311
[rustling]

295
00:17:13,648 --> 00:17:16,026
[gasps]

296
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:17,318
[GORDON]
Now's my chance.

297
00:17:17,402 --> 00:17:18,862
Let's see how much
stronger I've gotten

298
00:17:18,945 --> 00:17:20,864
since I left the Black Bulls!

299
00:17:23,074 --> 00:17:26,661
[GORDON] Poison Curse Magic:
Dwelling of the Poison Cloud.

300
00:17:28,204 --> 00:17:29,414
[gasps]

301
00:17:33,084 --> 00:17:34,502
I'll try again!

302
00:17:39,632 --> 00:17:40,967
[GORDON]
No good!

303
00:17:46,431 --> 00:17:48,975
[GORDON] My Poison Curse
Magic didn't work.

304
00:17:49,059 --> 00:17:51,144
Guess I'm weaker than I thought!

305
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:02,906
[GORDON] This is the first water
I've found in three whole days.

306
00:18:02,989 --> 00:18:05,533
I can live here by
myself for a while.

307
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:07,285
I'll hunt for food alone.

308
00:18:07,369 --> 00:18:09,329
Sleep alone.

309
00:18:09,412 --> 00:18:12,791
And wash my face alone,
just like this.

310
00:18:12,874 --> 00:18:14,209
Back at the hideout,

311
00:18:14,292 --> 00:18:18,046
Asta and I would always
wash each other's backs.

312
00:18:18,129 --> 00:18:20,090
Some nights I'd
drink with Vanessa

313
00:18:20,173 --> 00:18:22,967
while we talked
about our dreams.

314
00:18:23,051 --> 00:18:25,220
Gauche let me help take
care of his Marie doll

315
00:18:25,303 --> 00:18:26,930
every once in a while.

316
00:18:28,431 --> 00:18:31,476
[GORDON] And Luck and I would
fight almost to the death.

317
00:18:33,978 --> 00:18:36,398
[GORDON]
I must improve myself.

318
00:18:36,481 --> 00:18:40,235
But, the thought of being
alone has become so painful,

319
00:18:40,318 --> 00:18:41,695
even though that
was normal for me

320
00:18:41,778 --> 00:18:44,906
before I joined the Black Bulls.

321
00:18:44,989 --> 00:18:47,992
I wonder what my friends
are up to tonight.

322
00:18:49,953 --> 00:18:51,705
[GORDON]
This is nuts!

323
00:18:51,788 --> 00:18:53,998
We need to get a
move on, right now!

324
00:18:54,082 --> 00:18:55,750
Come on, there's
no time to lose!

325
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:57,502
Yes, sir!

326
00:19:00,088 --> 00:19:01,423
[GORDON]
They'll come looking for me.

327
00:19:01,506 --> 00:19:04,175
I just have to trust them.

328
00:19:04,259 --> 00:19:05,927
[gasps] You guys!

329
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:07,887
You found me already?

330
00:19:07,971 --> 00:19:12,767
[WOLF 137A growls]

331
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:16,062
[GORDON] That must be the
smaller one's mother!

332
00:19:16,146 --> 00:19:20,275
[roars]

333
00:19:20,358 --> 00:19:21,609
[YAMI]
This is nuts!

334
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:24,362
We gotta get a
move on, right now!

335
00:19:24,446 --> 00:19:26,156
Come on, there's
no time to lose!

336
00:19:26,239 --> 00:19:27,490
[BLACK BULLS]
Yes, sir!

337
00:19:28,783 --> 00:19:33,121
[panting]

338
00:19:33,204 --> 00:19:36,291
[GORDON] Poison Curse Magic:
Aufwachen Dachs!

339
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,086
[GORDON]
It's no use.

340
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:42,672
My magic isn't affecting
these things at all!

341
00:19:42,756 --> 00:19:43,715
[gasps]

342
00:19:43,798 --> 00:19:45,258
[roars]

343
00:19:54,225 --> 00:19:55,518
[GORDON]
This is it.

344
00:19:55,602 --> 00:19:58,938
I'm going to die alone,
without friends at my side!

345
00:20:03,401 --> 00:20:05,111
[GORDON]
No, wait.

346
00:20:06,404 --> 00:20:10,241
[GORDON] The Black Bulls
didn't abandon me after all!

347
00:20:10,325 --> 00:20:12,118
I understand now.

348
00:20:12,202 --> 00:20:14,954
I don't need solitude
to make me stronger.

349
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:20,126
No, I'm strong because of
the bond I share with them!

350
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:23,296
Loneliness is the
deadliest poison of all,

351
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:26,007
and the only antidote
that cures it

352
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:28,843
is the love of
my dear friends!

353
00:20:42,023 --> 00:20:43,400
[GORDON]
I'm so sorry.

354
00:20:43,483 --> 00:20:44,943
I allowed fear to take over,

355
00:20:45,026 --> 00:20:48,196
and I wrongfully attacked
you and your little one.

356
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:50,073
As a Magic Knight
who's been tasked with

357
00:20:50,156 --> 00:20:51,825
protecting this land,
that's a mistake

358
00:20:51,908 --> 00:20:53,993
that can never be forgiven.

359
00:20:54,077 --> 00:20:57,455
You're my allies and fellow
residents of the Clover Kingdom.

360
00:20:57,539 --> 00:21:01,501
What's more, you're
my friends, too.

361
00:21:13,304 --> 00:21:15,140
[GORDON]
Thanks for leading the way.

362
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:21,771
I see, the two of you
have an immunity

363
00:21:21,855 --> 00:21:24,232
to the type of magic that I use.

364
00:21:24,315 --> 00:21:27,152
So that's why my spells
didn't do anything.

365
00:21:33,324 --> 00:21:36,077
[GORDON]
I'm home!

366
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:37,912
Oh.

367
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:39,539
[GORDON]
What great friends.

368
00:21:39,622 --> 00:21:42,125
They must've gone out
to look for me.

369
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:45,086
There's no telling what kind of
trouble they might be in.

370
00:21:46,171 --> 00:21:48,923
[GORDON] Now it's my turn
to go rescue them.

371
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:52,927
I swear, I'll never leave my
dear friends behind again!

372
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,601
I want all of you to
push past your limits

373
00:21:59,684 --> 00:22:01,227
by stuffing your faces tonight!

374
00:22:01,311 --> 00:22:03,188
I sure pushed past mine!

375
00:22:03,271 --> 00:22:06,858
[MAGNA] Hey, boss, is it me,
or is everybody staring at us?

376
00:22:06,941 --> 00:22:09,110
Who cares? Apparently,
they're trying to sell off

377
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:13,114
their excess ingredients
right now, which means...

378
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:14,783
We can eat as much
grub as we want

379
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:17,160
and get 90 percent
off our bill!

380
00:23:56,259 --> 00:23:57,802
[CHARMY]
I refuse to give up!

381
00:23:57,886 --> 00:23:59,304
No matter how much
is on my plate,

382
00:23:59,387 --> 00:24:01,348
I'm gonna eat every
last bite of it!

383
00:24:01,431 --> 00:24:03,641
'Cause my tummy
deserves nothing less!

<i>Black Clover</i> , Page 138:
"In Zara's Footsteps."

385
00:24:07,437 --> 00:24:08,480
Wait, who's Zara?

386
00:24:08,563 --> 00:24:10,940
Oh! Must be Zora's dad!
