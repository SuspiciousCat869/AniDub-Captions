1
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,515
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:25,598 --> 00:00:28,560
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:32,105 --> 00:00:34,399
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:34,482 --> 00:00:37,235
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:43,491 --> 00:00:45,493
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:45,577 --> 00:00:49,456
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:53,835
[NARRATOR] Yami had just
arrived at the Golden Dawn

8
00:00:53,918 --> 00:00:56,880
headquarters for a meeting
with Vangeance when...

9
00:00:56,963 --> 00:00:59,924
[YAMI] I thought ole' Goldiguts
called me here to apologize.

10
00:01:00,008 --> 00:01:02,427
What's the big idea makin'
me wait around all day?

11
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:03,887
How much longer
is this gonna take?

12
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:06,056
I'm sure that he'll be here
as soon as possible!

13
00:01:06,139 --> 00:01:08,683
You playin' me for
a fool, Golden Dawn?

14
00:01:08,767 --> 00:01:10,226
[BOTH grunt]

15
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,687
[NARRATOR] Yami continued
to wait, trusting the man

16
00:01:12,771 --> 00:01:15,273
who'd fought alongside him
on behalf of their nation,

17
00:01:15,357 --> 00:01:18,651
and with whom he'd become
a Magic Knight captain.

18
00:01:18,735 --> 00:01:20,528
But in the meantime,

19
00:01:20,612 --> 00:01:22,697
Vangeance was revealing
his alternate identity

20
00:01:22,781 --> 00:01:26,534
during a confrontation
with the Wizard King.

21
00:01:26,618 --> 00:01:29,788
With two separate souls
inhabiting his body at once,

22
00:01:29,871 --> 00:01:31,706
he was not only
Captain William Vangeance

23
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:34,292
of the Golden Dawn,
but also Licht,

24
00:01:34,376 --> 00:01:36,628
the leader of the Eye
of the Midnight Sun.

25
00:01:36,711 --> 00:01:38,546
[LICHT]
William, my only human friend,

26
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:40,382
I know this was hard for you.

27
00:01:40,465 --> 00:01:41,716
I'm grateful.

28
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,635
Greetings to you.

29
00:01:43,718 --> 00:01:46,763
Wizard King, Julius Novachrono.

30
00:01:46,846 --> 00:01:50,100
I am the leader of the
Eye of the Midnight Sun

31
00:01:50,183 --> 00:01:51,893
known as Licht.

32
00:01:51,976 --> 00:01:54,020
I have dreaded this day.

33
00:01:54,104 --> 00:01:56,523
Yet here we are.

34
00:01:56,606 --> 00:01:58,566
[NARRATOR] Licht challenged
Julius to a battle,

35
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:01,152
hoping to steal the final
two magic stones he needed

36
00:02:01,236 --> 00:02:03,780
to enact his revenge
against humankind.

37
00:02:03,863 --> 00:02:05,407
But Julius used Time Magic

38
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,826
to predict and
block his attacks.

39
00:02:07,909 --> 00:02:09,411
[LICHT]
It's over!

40
00:02:10,495 --> 00:02:12,747
[LICHT]
His predictions are improving!

41
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:17,002
[JULIUS]
I can already see your future.

42
00:02:17,085 --> 00:02:19,963
And I can assure you,
it ends in defeat.

43
00:03:53,932 --> 00:03:56,101
[CLOVER CITIZENS murmuring]

Hey, look!

45
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,604
[VILLAGER 93B]
The castle tower!

46
00:03:59,688 --> 00:04:01,439
[VILLAGER 93C]
What are all those flashes?

47
00:04:01,523 --> 00:04:03,900

00:04:12,742 --> 00:04:13,993
Look, sir!

51
00:04:18,206 --> 00:04:20,750
[MARX]
That power--it's Julius!

52
00:04:20,834 --> 00:04:22,794
He must be fighting someone!

53
00:04:24,129 --> 00:04:26,131
A Light Magic user strong
enough to be holding

54
00:04:26,214 --> 00:04:28,216
his own against the Wizard King.

55
00:04:28,299 --> 00:04:29,551
Who else could it be
but the leader

56
00:04:29,634 --> 00:04:32,679
of the Eye of the
Midnight Sun... Licht.

57
00:04:35,056 --> 00:04:37,517
[MARX] Except, the Royal
Knights are supposed to be

58
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,186
out on a mission to
eliminate him right now!

59
00:04:43,273 --> 00:04:44,691
[MARX]
How did he get to the castle?

60
00:04:44,774 --> 00:04:46,026
Is the Midnight Sun to blame

61
00:04:46,109 --> 00:04:47,652
for the communication
breakdown between

62
00:04:47,736 --> 00:04:49,195
me and Julius?

63
00:04:59,664 --> 00:05:02,250
[MARX]
There's so much we don't know.

64
00:05:02,334 --> 00:05:03,752
[MAGIC KNIGHT 93B]
What's happening out there?

65
00:05:03,835 --> 00:05:06,379
[MAGIC KNIGHT 93C] Is Sir Julius
fighting with somebody?

66
00:05:06,463 --> 00:05:08,381
[MAGIC KNIGHT 93A]
What can we do to stop this?

67
00:05:08,465 --> 00:05:10,717
[MARX]
Please remain calm.

68
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,803
Our mettle may be tested
in times like this,

69
00:05:13,887 --> 00:05:16,264
but we'll never be able
to defend Clover Kingdom

70
00:05:16,348 --> 00:05:18,808
if we let panic overtake us!

71
00:05:18,892 --> 00:05:20,935
[MARX]
That's right, just stay calm.

72
00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:24,773
Now, more than ever, my duty
is to keep a cool head.

73
00:05:24,856 --> 00:05:26,816
If any of us got involved,
the difference in skill

74
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,069
would only hold Julius back!

75
00:05:30,445 --> 00:05:33,073
[MARX] I don't expect
he'll be defeated.

76
00:05:33,156 --> 00:05:35,116
If it came down to it,
the only knights

77
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,119
fit to join the fray
would be captain-caliber.

78
00:05:39,287 --> 00:05:42,332
[MARX] I'll send an alert to all
the Magic Knight headquarters!

79
00:05:45,001 --> 00:05:46,378
What the heck?

80
00:05:46,461 --> 00:05:47,879
Hey, Char!

81
00:05:47,962 --> 00:05:50,548
A Transmission Spell?

82
00:05:50,632 --> 00:05:52,801
A call from the
Royal Capital, sir.

83
00:05:52,884 --> 00:05:55,387
This is an urgent
message to all captains!

84
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,722
The Wizard King is at
Clover Castle fighting someone

85
00:05:57,806 --> 00:06:02,143
who appears to be the leader
of the Eye of the Midnight Sun.

86
00:06:02,227 --> 00:06:03,978
As was the case with
the previous assault

87
00:06:04,062 --> 00:06:06,439
on the capital, it's possible
that they're plotting

88
00:06:06,523 --> 00:06:09,567
multiple attacks.
Knights, please follow

89
00:06:09,651 --> 00:06:11,861
your captains' orders
on where to stand guard.

90
00:06:11,945 --> 00:06:14,197
And, Captains, finish
organizing your guard squads

91
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,991
and assemble in
the Royal Capital!

92

I don't understand this!

93
00:06:19,077 --> 00:06:20,954
Yeah, I thought
Captain Mereoleona

94
00:06:21,037 --> 00:06:23,498
was infiltrating their hideout.

95
00:06:23,581 --> 00:06:26,751
[LEOPOLD] Their leader is
attacking the Royal Capital?

96
00:06:26,835 --> 00:06:30,839
This is the perfect chance
to avenge my brother! But...

97
00:06:33,049 --> 00:06:35,176
What's with all
these pitiful faces?

98
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,761
You dare to call
yourselves members

It's always best to stay calm!

Even though my
sister isn't here,

104
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,063
we will follow the
instructions from the capital

105
00:06:47,147 --> 00:06:49,983
and attack the enemy on our own!

106
00:06:50,066 --> 00:06:51,276
He's got a point!

107

This is no time
for us to falter!

[CRIMSON LION 71F] Yeah,
we're the Crimson Lion Kings!

109
00:06:56,865 --> 00:06:58,283
[GOLDEN DAWN 92B]
It says we're to follow orders,

110
00:06:58,366 --> 00:07:00,785
but the captain is
nowhere to be found.

111
00:07:00,869 --> 00:07:02,162
[GOLDEN DAWN 92A]
I sure hope Captain Vangeance

112
00:07:02,245 --> 00:07:03,997
gets back soon.

Don't tell me...

I hope I'm wrong about this.

115

growing quite pedestrian.

Even without looking
into the future,

much trouble avoiding them.

[LICHT] He can keep up
with me at this speed?

is this human able to see?

and threw it back?

Wow! Close call.

Despite my ability to see
what you're going to do next,

you're too quick on your feet
for me to catch up with you.

[LICHT]
But how? What is this strength?

128
00:09:17,422 --> 00:09:20,633
He's only human.
He shouldn't be able to--

129
00:09:20,717 --> 00:09:22,510
You know, you'd be
awfully helpful to me

130
00:09:22,594 --> 00:09:24,679
if you'd surrender
right about now.

131
00:09:24,763 --> 00:09:28,099
I wouldn't wanna cause any
damage to Vangeance's body.

132
00:09:28,183 --> 00:09:30,268
[LICHT]
So he won't kill me.

133
00:09:30,352 --> 00:09:32,729
He's trying to
capture me instead.

He's holding back!

Against me and my
four-leaf grimoire?

136

All right, then what
must his be like?

137
00:09:41,488 --> 00:09:43,782
And where could it be?

138
00:09:43,865 --> 00:09:45,450
I assume you must
be getting curious

139
00:09:45,533 --> 00:09:46,826
about my grimoire.

140
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:49,162
You're welcome to
examine it for yourself.

141
00:09:49,245 --> 00:09:50,330
It's right up there.

00:09:50,413 --> 00:09:51,748
[LICHT gasps]

143
00:09:53,124 --> 00:09:55,210
[LICHT]
It doesn't even have a cover!

144
00:09:55,293 --> 00:09:58,880
What kind of grimoire has
a bizarre shape like that?

145
00:09:58,963 --> 00:10:02,092
I'm a Time Magic user
with a coverless grimoire.

146
00:10:02,175 --> 00:10:03,968
I never knew whether
that was good or bad,

147
00:10:04,052 --> 00:10:07,347
but I could tell that it meant
I was something special.

148
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:09,307
I thought hard about it,

149
00:10:09,391 --> 00:10:11,351
and I realized that
this grimoire and I

150
00:10:11,434 --> 00:10:13,436
have a lot in common.

151
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:17,107
Neither of us fits into
a particular category.

152
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:19,234
So, who am I, really?

153
00:10:19,317 --> 00:10:21,528
What am I meant to achieve?

154
00:10:21,611 --> 00:10:24,406
I asked myself these
questions for years,

155
00:10:24,489 --> 00:10:28,368
and the more I learned,
the more I wondered.

156
00:10:28,451 --> 00:10:31,913
After I'd made it this far,
it was finally clear.

157
00:10:31,996 --> 00:10:36,793
The path I'd walked
all this way; that is me.

158
00:10:40,505 --> 00:10:43,299
[JULIUS]
I am the Wizard King.

159
00:10:43,383 --> 00:10:44,843
[gasps]

160
00:10:44,926 --> 00:10:47,929
[LICHT]
Yes, I understand now.

161
00:10:48,013 --> 00:10:49,764
What we're planning
to do once we have

162
00:10:49,848 --> 00:10:52,934
the magic stones will be
an attempt to violate

163
00:10:53,018 --> 00:10:55,729
the natural laws of this world!

164
00:10:55,812 --> 00:10:59,482
So, this man... This human...

165
00:10:59,566 --> 00:11:01,776
He must have been placed
here by Fate itself

166
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,904
in order to thwart
our ambitions!

167
00:11:04,988 --> 00:11:07,782
He is the final
bastion of reason!

168
00:11:07,866 --> 00:11:10,326
And as the Wizard King,

169
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:15,790
I'll protect the people
of Clover. Come what may.

170
00:11:15,874 --> 00:11:17,334
[LICHT]
I knew it.

171
00:11:17,417 --> 00:11:22,005
That's all the more reason
why I must end his life!

172
00:11:25,133 --> 00:11:28,803
Protect them? Go ahead and try!

173
00:11:30,221 --> 00:11:33,558
[LICHT]
Sealing Magic: Release!

174
00:11:35,393 --> 00:11:37,771
[JULIUS]
He's expanded his power!

175
00:11:44,778 --> 00:11:46,446
Hey. What's that?

176
00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:47,614
Look up in the sky!

177
00:11:47,697 --> 00:11:50,825
Oh, dear, what's
going to happen now?

178
00:11:53,995 --> 00:11:56,873
[JULIUS]
It's absolutely gargantuan.

179
00:12:05,632 --> 00:12:07,592
Humans took away everything.

180
00:12:07,676 --> 00:12:11,805
All of our happiness!
Our friends and loved ones.

181
00:12:11,888 --> 00:12:15,892
Our peaceful days.
Just like that.

182
00:12:15,975 --> 00:12:18,561
It may be an affront to reason,

183
00:12:18,645 --> 00:12:22,315
but you'll atone for
your sins. Now, die!

184
00:12:32,534 --> 00:12:34,244
[JULIUS] He's been holding
onto enough power

185
00:12:34,327 --> 00:12:36,079
to cover the entire kingdom.

186
00:12:36,162 --> 00:12:37,956
Is he going to release
all of that magic

187
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:40,500
and wipe out the whole populace?

188
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:43,294
[LICHT]
I may not be able to kill you.

189
00:12:43,378 --> 00:12:46,506
But I can easily
exterminate everybody else.

190
00:12:46,589 --> 00:12:48,758
Whoa, is that magic?

191
00:12:48,842 --> 00:12:50,927
Swords of light--
thousands of them!

192
00:12:51,011 --> 00:12:54,139
[CHILD 93AA] Look, Mama,
the sky's full of swords!

193
00:12:54,222 --> 00:12:55,849
[CHILD 93A]
So bright!

194
00:12:55,932 --> 00:12:58,601
[VILLAGER 93I]
Those blades could kill us all.

195
00:12:58,685 --> 00:13:00,520
Is this how the world ends?

196
00:13:00,603 --> 00:13:02,397
It's unbelievable.

197
00:13:04,649 --> 00:13:08,570
[NASH] What's that bright light?
It's way over there.

198
00:13:08,653 --> 00:13:10,697
I have a bad feeling.

199
00:13:14,242 --> 00:13:15,452
It's all right.

200
00:13:15,535 --> 00:13:18,496
Even if it turns out to be
something dangerous.

201
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,331
We'll always have
the brave Magic Knights

202
00:13:20,415 --> 00:13:22,542
to guard the Clover Kingdom.

203
00:13:26,713 --> 00:13:29,174
[YAMI] That's a big
hunk o' Light Magic.

204
00:13:29,257 --> 00:13:33,720
Dammit! What the hell
is this, Julius?

205
00:13:33,803 --> 00:13:35,347
I gotta hurry!

206
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:42,562
[JULIUS] His spell's already
covering everything in sight.

207
00:13:42,645 --> 00:13:44,272
At this rate...

208
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:49,444
Now... Here is your
punishment, humans!

209
00:13:49,527 --> 00:13:53,823
Light Magic: Arrows of Judgment!

210
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:06,544
[JULIUS]
I did have my doubts.

211
00:14:06,628 --> 00:14:08,546
Honestly, why do
the regular folk

212
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:11,299
have such pathetic magic
compared to people like us?

213
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:12,509
I couldn't agree more.

214
00:14:12,592 --> 00:14:14,177
To tell you the truth,
I'm not sure why

215
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,179
commoners exist
in the first place.

216
00:14:16,262 --> 00:14:18,390
We shouldn't have to share
the same country with them!

217
00:14:18,473 --> 00:14:19,557
[NOBLE 93A]
I'll drink to that!

218
00:14:19,641 --> 00:14:23,061
[NOBLES laugh]

219
00:14:23,144 --> 00:14:25,730
[JULIUS]
But is that really true?

220
00:14:25,814 --> 00:14:27,649
What're you looking at?

221
00:14:27,732 --> 00:14:29,359
Nothing.

222
00:14:29,442 --> 00:14:32,112
[JULIUS] They had strong magic
power, and yet the only thing

223
00:14:32,195 --> 00:14:33,905
they ever used it for
was to selfishly

224
00:14:33,988 --> 00:14:35,907
line their own pockets.

225
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:39,244
Why did these
useless mages exist?

226
00:14:39,327 --> 00:14:41,996
I see. You're that
Magic Knight, aren't you?

227
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,874
Yes, the one with
the strange grimoire.

228
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:46,251
Well, no matter.

229
00:14:46,334 --> 00:14:48,503
Anyway, I was about to tell
you, there's a merchant

230
00:14:48,586 --> 00:14:51,131
who wants me to give
his business a leg up.

231
00:14:51,214 --> 00:14:52,173
[NOBLE 93B]
Really?

232
00:14:52,257 --> 00:14:53,341
[NOBLE 93A]
Oh, we'll talk.

233
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:57,554
[NOBLE 93B laughs]
I can't wait to hear!

234
00:14:58,763 --> 00:15:01,474
[JULIUS] I kept fighting
in my Magic Knight squad,

235
00:15:01,558 --> 00:15:04,436
hoping I'd eventually
discover my calling.

236
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:06,396
Then, one day...

237
00:15:07,689 --> 00:15:08,815
[gasps]

238
00:15:08,898 --> 00:15:11,609
[BANDIT 93A cackles]
Gimme all your yul

239
00:15:11,693 --> 00:15:13,987
or I'll bash your face in!

240
00:15:15,905 --> 00:15:17,574
[ZARA]
Hold it!

241
00:15:17,657 --> 00:15:20,243
You villains are always
disturbing the peace,

242
00:15:20,326 --> 00:15:22,704
and I'm fed up with it!

243
00:15:22,787 --> 00:15:24,164
[JULIUS]
...I met Zara.

244
00:15:24,247 --> 00:15:26,124
The very first commoner
to be selected

245
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:28,668
as a member of
the Magic Knights.

246
00:15:28,752 --> 00:15:30,128
We'll fight if you want.

247
00:15:30,211 --> 00:15:33,131
But so you know, my magic's
about 100 times tougher

248
00:15:33,214 --> 00:15:35,216
than anything you
can throw at me!

249
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,302
A Magic Knight, eh?

250
00:15:37,385 --> 00:15:40,597
Am I s'posed to be scared
of you or somethin', pal?

251
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,432
That's a bad move.

252
00:15:52,359 --> 00:15:54,069
Had enough?

253
00:15:56,196 --> 00:15:59,199
Now, go find somewhere safe.

254
00:15:59,282 --> 00:16:02,619
[VILLAGER 93L] Thank you.
We're so glad you showed up.

255
00:16:02,702 --> 00:16:06,539
Hey, you, do me a favor!
Come down for a sec!

256
00:16:08,249 --> 00:16:11,002
[JULIUS] His power itself
was weak, but his strategic

257
00:16:11,086 --> 00:16:13,838
fighting style made
full use of Trap Magic.

258
00:16:13,922 --> 00:16:16,675
It was clear he had
worked hard to master it.

259
00:16:18,343 --> 00:16:20,428
What kind of crazy
spell is that?

260
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:23,014
It's almost like you're turning
back time or something!

261
00:16:23,098 --> 00:16:26,059
It looks that way, but
that's not exactly the case.

262
00:16:26,142 --> 00:16:29,729
Time Magic, huh?
That is impressive!

263
00:16:29,813 --> 00:16:31,648
Seems like it would
be a sure-fire way

264
00:16:31,731 --> 00:16:33,233
to prevent casualties.

265
00:16:33,316 --> 00:16:35,110
You're Zara, aren't you?

266
00:16:35,193 --> 00:16:36,736
It appears that you're
injured as well.

267
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,363
Sit down and rest
so I can take a look.

268
00:16:38,446 --> 00:16:40,073
[ZARA]
Nah, I'll be all right.

269
00:16:40,156 --> 00:16:41,658
When you're a Magic
Knight, you're supposed

270
00:16:41,741 --> 00:16:44,244
to put the lives of
the civilians first!

271
00:16:44,327 --> 00:16:47,330
You agree. Dontcha, Julius?

272
00:16:47,414 --> 00:16:49,791
Okay, this guy seems fine.

273
00:16:49,874 --> 00:16:51,042
[JULIUS]
Unlike all the knights

274
00:16:51,126 --> 00:16:53,545
who were selfishly
seeking glory...

275
00:16:53,628 --> 00:16:58,466
He was truly prioritizing the
lives of the people he saved.

276
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,135
I still didn't know
what a Magic Knight

277
00:17:00,218 --> 00:17:02,303
was really supposed to be,

278
00:17:02,387 --> 00:17:05,974
but even I saw that he
was the genuine article.

279
00:17:06,057 --> 00:17:10,353
Later on, I learned
that Zara had died.

280
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:21,281
[JULIUS]
Hey. Are you--?

281
00:17:36,254 --> 00:17:39,466
[JULIUS] Zara had carried out
his duty as a Magic Knight,

282
00:17:39,549 --> 00:17:42,260
and I wanted to follow
in his footsteps.

283
00:17:42,344 --> 00:17:45,347
I was finally sure
of my purpose in life.

284
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:48,350
To become the kind
of knight he was.

285
00:17:48,433 --> 00:17:49,642
[MAGIC KNIGHT 93HA]
They're saying he was murdered

286
00:17:49,726 --> 00:17:51,478
by one of his own squad members.

287
00:17:51,561 --> 00:17:53,772
[MAGIC KNIGHT 93HB laughs]
Really?

288
00:17:53,855 --> 00:17:56,858
Well, we can't have a nasty
rumor like that going around.

289
00:17:56,941 --> 00:17:58,151
[MAGIC KNIGHT 93HC]
Word is he was prying

290
00:17:58,234 --> 00:17:59,694
into things he shouldn't.

291
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:01,863
[MAGIC KNIGHT 93HD] What's one
dead commoner, anyway?

292
00:18:01,946 --> 00:18:03,615
No one's going to miss him!

293
00:18:03,698 --> 00:18:07,410
[MAGIC KNIGHTS laugh]

294
00:18:07,494 --> 00:18:10,288
[JULIUS] How could this
possibly be right?

295
00:18:10,372 --> 00:18:12,957
And it wasn't just among
the Magic Knights, either.

296
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:15,335
It was the way the
country had always been.

297
00:18:15,418 --> 00:18:18,129
The class system made
the nobles prideful

298
00:18:18,213 --> 00:18:20,507
and the commoners hopeless.

299
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:24,678
There had to be more,
on both sides of the coin.

300
00:18:24,761 --> 00:18:30,684
Magic potential, human
potential, is infinite!

301
00:18:30,767 --> 00:18:36,690
But to be heard, I needed
power, standing, and trust.

302
00:18:36,773 --> 00:18:39,109
I devoted my efforts
to producing results

303
00:18:39,192 --> 00:18:42,696
and became the Wizard King.

304
00:18:42,779 --> 00:18:47,325
Surely magic, and people,
should be more free.

305
00:18:47,409 --> 00:18:49,661
It hasn't happened overnight.

306
00:18:49,744 --> 00:18:52,747
But I can see now that,
little by little,

307
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:57,377
this kingdom and its people
are finally beginning to change.

308
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:00,046
After all the ones I came
to trust and respect

309
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:02,716
combined their strength,
as well as the strength

310
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,343
of those who they trusted...

311
00:19:05,427 --> 00:19:09,723
As the Wizard King,
I can't let it end here!

312
00:19:09,806 --> 00:19:11,975
I refuse to!

313
00:19:16,563 --> 00:19:20,650
[JULIUS] Time Reversal Magic:
Chrono Anastasis!

314
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,120
[VILLAGER 93N]
What's happening now?

315
00:19:58,563 --> 00:20:01,608
[LICHT] Your Time Magic
was enough to save them.

316
00:20:01,691 --> 00:20:04,986
Impressive. Though, it
would appear you've used

317
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:08,406
all the time and power
you had saved up.

318
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:11,701
You would have seen this
attack of mine coming.

319
00:20:11,785 --> 00:20:15,080
But, unfortunately, you
weren't able to call off

320
00:20:15,163 --> 00:20:19,584
that final Time Magic spell
in order to get out of the way.

321
00:20:19,668 --> 00:20:23,880
Because you're...
the Wizard King.

322
00:20:23,963 --> 00:20:27,258
[YAMI gasps]

323
00:20:36,518 --> 00:20:40,021
[LICHT]
And being the Wizard King...

324
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:43,566
...is your one
and only weakness.

325
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:15,265
[YAMI] What happened here?
Tell me, Vangeance!

326
00:22:48,942 --> 00:22:50,694

[MARX]
"Calm Yourselves!"

328
00:22:56,908 --> 00:22:58,243
[MAGIC KNIGHT 93B]
What's happening out there?

329
00:22:58,326 --> 00:23:00,578
[MAGIC KNIGHT 93C] Is Sir Julius
fighting with somebody?

330
00:23:00,662 --> 00:23:02,622
[MAGIC KNIGHT 93A]
What can we do to stop this?

331
00:23:02,706 --> 00:23:03,707
[MARX]
Please remain calm.

332
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:05,291
[MAGIC KNIGHTS gasp]

333
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:07,377
[MARX]
That's right, just stay calm.

334
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:10,839
Now, more than ever, my duty
is to keep a cool head.

335
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:13,591
I don't expect
he'll be defeated.

336
00:23:13,675 --> 00:23:15,635
If it came down to it,
the only knights

337
00:23:15,719 --> 00:23:18,471
fit to join the fray
would be captain-caliber.

338
00:23:18,555 --> 00:23:22,475
I'll send an alert to all
the Magic Knight headquarters!

339
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:25,145
You've reached "My Magic is
Never Giving Up" Bar & Grill,

340
00:23:25,228 --> 00:23:26,354
what's your order?

341
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:28,523
I'm sorry, I must've
called the wrong place!

342
00:23:28,606 --> 00:23:31,109
[MARX] Okay, this time I'll
call the Magic Knights!

343
00:23:31,192 --> 00:23:33,945
Thank you for calling the
Melty Mana Hot Spring Resort,

344
00:23:34,029 --> 00:23:35,488
are you making a reservation?

345
00:23:35,572 --> 00:23:37,198
No thanks, I'm fine!

346
00:23:37,282 --> 00:23:38,825
[MARX]
One more try!

347
00:23:40,618 --> 00:23:41,995
And who might this be?

348
00:23:42,078 --> 00:23:43,204
Uh, hello there, ma'am,

349
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:44,789
is this a Magic
Knight headquarters?

350
00:23:44,873 --> 00:23:46,583
I told you people
I don't want any!

351
00:23:46,666 --> 00:23:49,169
[MARX]
Damn! I can't get through!

352
00:23:49,252 --> 00:23:51,212
What the hell am I
doing wrong here?

353
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:53,798
[MAGIC KNIGHT 93B]
It's okay. Just stay calm.

354
00:23:53,882 --> 00:23:55,050
[MARX]
Right.

355
00:23:56,718 --> 00:23:58,762
[YAMI] What's gotten
into you, Vangeance?

356
00:23:58,845 --> 00:24:01,806
You just betrayed Julius's
trust and my friendship.

357
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:04,142
And for that,
you deserve to die!
