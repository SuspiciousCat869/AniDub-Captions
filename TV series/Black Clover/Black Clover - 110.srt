1
00:00:23,763 --> 00:00:25,682
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:25,765 --> 00:00:28,560
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:32,105 --> 00:00:34,441
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:34,524 --> 00:00:36,985
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:43,533 --> 00:00:45,535
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:45,618 --> 00:00:49,664
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:53,752
[NARRATOR] Driven by rage,
the elves who'd been reborn

8
00:00:53,835 --> 00:00:56,838
as Magic Knights continued
their vicious attack.

9
00:00:56,921 --> 00:00:59,758
As the Black Bulls hurried
to defend the royal capital,

10
00:00:59,841 --> 00:01:03,053
they crossed paths with
Sally, Rades, and Valtos,

11
00:01:03,136 --> 00:01:05,138
who had narrowly escaped
death when Licht

12
00:01:05,221 --> 00:01:07,265
unexpectedly used
them as a sacrifice

13
00:01:07,349 --> 00:01:09,351
to resurrect his elven brethren.

14
00:01:09,434 --> 00:01:11,478
[RADES]
You get on my nerves, too.

15
00:01:11,561 --> 00:01:15,106
But my first priority is
killing off that bastard, Licht.

16
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:17,192
[NARRATOR] After some
convincing, the trio found

17
00:01:17,275 --> 00:01:18,777
common ground with
the Black Bulls

18
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:20,445
and joined their cause.

19
00:01:20,528 --> 00:01:22,072
Meanwhile, at the castle,

20
00:01:22,155 --> 00:01:24,240
Noelle's determination
to save her siblings

21
00:01:24,324 --> 00:01:26,618
and protect the capital
motivated her to learn

22
00:01:26,701 --> 00:01:28,912
an awe-inspiring new technique.

23
00:01:28,995 --> 00:01:30,872
[NOELLE]
It's over!

24
00:01:32,082 --> 00:01:34,334
Langris, no!

25
00:01:34,417 --> 00:01:36,503
[NARRATOR]
As for Finral...

26
00:01:40,423 --> 00:01:42,842
Your brother! Wake up!

27
00:01:44,511 --> 00:01:46,221
Fallen Angel's Wingbeat!

28
00:01:47,806 --> 00:01:50,892
[FINRAL]
This is my last chance!

29
00:01:50,975 --> 00:01:52,268
Your big brother really shines

30
00:01:52,352 --> 00:01:55,105
when it comes to
speed and accuracy.

31
00:01:55,188 --> 00:01:58,566
So I'll stop you,
whatever it takes!

32
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:02,320
I hope you're ready. Wake up!

33
00:02:02,404 --> 00:02:04,114
[NARRATOR]
He finally found a way to quell

34
00:02:04,197 --> 00:02:08,702
the destructive rampage of
his possessed brother, Langris.

35
00:02:08,785 --> 00:02:12,038
But, once Patry returned
to the hideout,

36
00:02:12,122 --> 00:02:14,958
he began to put a
terrifying plan into motion.

37
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:17,794
[PATRY] Now all that's left
is to fit the final magic stone

38
00:02:17,877 --> 00:02:20,046
into the pedestal
within the castle,

39
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:23,675
and initiate the spell that
will destroy the Clover Kingdom.

40
00:02:23,758 --> 00:02:27,137
After humanity is snuffed
out, we will reclaim

41
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:31,474
this world, making it a peaceful
place for elves alone.

42
00:02:31,558 --> 00:02:33,143
Roger that.

43
00:02:33,226 --> 00:02:37,731
As soon as these two wake up,
all the actors'll be on stage.

44
00:04:22,544 --> 00:04:23,670
Hey there.

45
00:04:23,753 --> 00:04:26,423
How do you feel after
that nice long nap?

46
00:04:26,506 --> 00:04:30,260
So, do you two remember?
What your old names were?

47
00:04:30,343 --> 00:04:31,594
Who you worked for?

48
00:04:31,678 --> 00:04:35,098
Yeah. We made up the
Third Eye, as I recall.

49
00:04:35,181 --> 00:04:38,184
Fana the Hateful,
and Vetto the Despair,

50
00:04:38,268 --> 00:04:41,479
and you were called Rhya the
Disloyal, isn't that right?

51
00:04:41,563 --> 00:04:43,523
How funny.

52
00:04:43,606 --> 00:04:45,316
[NARRATOR]
As the Eye of the Midnight Sun's

53
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,111
most formidable warriors,
the Third Eye had fought

54
00:04:48,194 --> 00:04:51,656
multiple battles against Asta
and his friends in the past.

55
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,992
Vetto was killed,
and Fana's soul

56
00:04:54,075 --> 00:04:56,953
became separated from the
body it had been inhabiting,

57
00:04:57,037 --> 00:05:00,832
which, in turn, allowed that
body to begin a new life.

58
00:05:00,915 --> 00:05:03,168
Rhya preserved the
general characteristics

59
00:05:03,251 --> 00:05:06,171
of the human bodies the
other two had been using,

60
00:05:06,254 --> 00:05:09,799
and prepared two new vessels
for their souls to possess.

61
00:05:09,883 --> 00:05:11,634
[RHYA]
Welcome back, guys.

62
00:05:11,718 --> 00:05:13,887
I could only incubate
you for so long,

63
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:16,389
so your bodies are
about 15 years old.

64
00:05:16,473 --> 00:05:19,476
Which means you're smaller
than me for a change, Vetto.

65
00:05:19,559 --> 00:05:21,853
Well, seeing as how
I've already died twice,

66
00:05:21,936 --> 00:05:22,979
this'll do fine.

67
00:05:23,063 --> 00:05:24,022
Agreed.

68
00:05:24,105 --> 00:05:25,899
Creating near-identical bodies

69
00:05:25,982 --> 00:05:28,526
with the same mana
as the originals.

70
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:30,111
I gotta say,

71
00:05:30,195 --> 00:05:33,698
Sally's really outdone herself
with her research on this one.

72
00:05:33,782 --> 00:05:35,408
I'd compliment her,
but she's probably

73
00:05:35,492 --> 00:05:37,077
been dead for a while now.

74
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,955
[FANA] My mind is a lot
clearer this time around, too.

75
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,749
Oh, I can explain that.

76
00:05:42,832 --> 00:05:46,336
See, last round, we used the
evil eye to bring you back,

77
00:05:46,419 --> 00:05:49,673
so I'm sure your malice
was a lot stronger before.

78
00:05:49,756 --> 00:05:52,676
Evil eye? That's right.

79
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:55,387
I did feel
half-asleep back then.

80
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:59,849
It was almost like I was having
some terrible nightmare.

81
00:05:59,933 --> 00:06:02,435
Salamander!

82
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:04,020
There's no response.

83
00:06:04,104 --> 00:06:06,773
I guess I must not
have it anymore.

84
00:06:06,856 --> 00:06:08,483
[RHYA] That means
it found somebody else

85
00:06:08,566 --> 00:06:10,318
who was qualified
while Fana was gone

86
00:06:10,402 --> 00:06:13,196
and partnered up
with them instead.

87
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:15,990
[RHYA] Eh, it's fine.
Even without Salamander,

88
00:06:16,074 --> 00:06:17,826
you're strong enough
as you are now.

89
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:19,202
Yeah, that's true.

90
00:06:19,285 --> 00:06:21,871
There's no way I'd let
those humans beat me!

91
00:06:21,955 --> 00:06:22,872
[VETTO gasps]

92
00:06:22,956 --> 00:06:24,457
'Kay, the next step
is to take you

93
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:25,792
over to the Grimoire Tower.

94
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,961
The sooner you let one
pick you out, the better.

95
00:06:28,044 --> 00:06:31,631
Before that,
we need some clothes.

96
00:06:31,715 --> 00:06:34,968
Especially for her. And quick.

97
00:06:35,051 --> 00:06:36,845
He's right. Now that
I take a good look,

98
00:06:36,928 --> 00:06:39,014
I think you're more
developed than last time.

99
00:06:39,097 --> 00:06:40,306
Good for y--

100
00:06:50,692 --> 00:06:53,611
Before too long,
this false royal capital

101
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:56,823
constructed by the humans
will be no more.

102
00:06:56,906 --> 00:07:00,076
[FRAGIL] They've finally
gathered up above.

103
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,911
[KLAUS] Then they must've
received the revelation

104
00:07:01,995 --> 00:07:04,247
in preparation for this moment.

105
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:08,126
[ELVES]
Those who guide the elves.

106
00:07:08,209 --> 00:07:10,378
The Apostles of Sephira!

107
00:07:19,346 --> 00:07:20,847
Licht, it's you!

108
00:07:24,559 --> 00:07:27,520
He's not saying much,
but I can guarantee

109
00:07:27,604 --> 00:07:29,773
you he's in there
somewhere, deep down.

110
00:07:29,856 --> 00:07:31,983
Trust me, Patry, as soon
as the reincarnation

111
00:07:32,067 --> 00:07:35,070
is complete, you'll see
the old Licht again.

112
00:07:35,153 --> 00:07:39,532
I understand. Wait,
what about that boy?

113
00:07:39,616 --> 00:07:42,118
[RHYA]
Oh, yeah, that was weird.

114
00:07:42,202 --> 00:07:44,245
He was reincarnated
like us, but somehow,

115
00:07:44,329 --> 00:07:46,873
he still kept the
human's personality.

116
00:07:46,956 --> 00:07:48,291
Are you serious?

117
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:49,668
[RHYA]
Don't sweat it.

118
00:07:49,751 --> 00:07:52,295
He'll come around, too,
when everything's finished.

119
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:54,589
Let's go and wait over there.

120
00:07:54,673 --> 00:07:55,799
[PATRY]
Okay.

121
00:07:59,386 --> 00:08:02,055
[RHYA]
Man, get a load of this view!

122
00:08:02,138 --> 00:08:04,974
The party's in full swing.

123
00:08:05,058 --> 00:08:07,435
Now then, let's get started.

124
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:15,485
[RHYA] By infusing
Gravito Stones with magic,

125
00:08:15,568 --> 00:08:17,779
we'll open the door
below Clover Castle,

126
00:08:17,862 --> 00:08:20,448
and release the seal
on the underworld!

127
00:08:20,532 --> 00:08:21,991
[gasps]

128
00:08:22,075 --> 00:08:24,119
What the hell is that?

129
00:08:29,332 --> 00:08:31,334
This doesn't look good.

130
00:08:31,418 --> 00:08:34,546
[NOELLE] Nozel, what's
happening to the castle?

131
00:08:34,629 --> 00:08:37,674
[MIMOSA]
I don't understand this at all!

132
00:08:37,757 --> 00:08:40,218
[BAVAL] This is a magic space
that serves as a border

133
00:08:40,301 --> 00:08:42,303
between this world and
the next, which the elves

134
00:08:42,387 --> 00:08:45,056
entrusted to the humans
through an ancient pact.

135
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,308
It's called the Shadow Palace.

136
00:08:47,392 --> 00:08:50,437
It can only be opened by
the Apostles of Sephira.

137
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:55,358
Ten elves who can receive
divine messages. See?

138
00:08:55,442 --> 00:08:57,318
When we place the
final magic stone

139
00:08:57,402 --> 00:08:59,654
into its pedestal
inside the palace,

140
00:08:59,738 --> 00:09:02,782
the elves' great reincarnation
will be complete!

141
00:09:02,866 --> 00:09:06,036
Of course, a price must be paid
for our use of these bodies.

142
00:09:06,119 --> 00:09:11,207
Sadly, their human souls will
be sent to the underworld!

143
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:12,584
Think again!

144
00:09:12,667 --> 00:09:16,379
As an envoy of beauty,
I won't allow such ugliness!

145
00:09:22,093 --> 00:09:23,470
[MIMOSA]
David's Dice Magic gives him

146
00:09:23,553 --> 00:09:25,805
various advantages,
with higher rolls

147
00:09:25,889 --> 00:09:27,849
being the most devastating!

148
00:09:27,932 --> 00:09:30,685
But, getting this
much power from a two?

149
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:32,937
It doesn't make sense!

150
00:09:33,021 --> 00:09:35,440
It won't do you any
good to attack me,

151
00:09:35,523 --> 00:09:38,234
but you might as well
give it a shot.

152
00:09:38,318 --> 00:09:41,863
[MIMOSA gasps]
How are we going to fix this?

153
00:09:44,074 --> 00:09:45,575
[YAMI]
'Kay, so there's a magical

154
00:09:45,658 --> 00:09:47,452
space growin' over there.

155
00:09:47,535 --> 00:09:52,123
I don't really get the details,
but it's definitely bad news.

156
00:09:52,207 --> 00:09:55,126
[cackles] Sounds like our
cue to head that way.

157
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:56,586
Huh?

158
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:03,468
[KLAUS] You won't stop
the Apostles of Sephira!

159
00:10:03,551 --> 00:10:04,969
I get the feelin'
they're not plannin'

160
00:10:05,053 --> 00:10:06,221
to cooperate with us.

161
00:10:06,304 --> 00:10:08,181
Show me what you've got, then!

162
00:10:08,264 --> 00:10:10,433
I'll shred you all
to smithereens!

[JACK]
Dammit!

166
00:10:16,564 --> 00:10:18,400
It's one thing after another.

167
00:10:18,483 --> 00:10:20,652
Can't these jerks
just give us a break?

168
00:10:20,735 --> 00:10:22,070
[NOELLE]
Now what?

[gasps]

00:10:28,868 --> 00:10:31,538
Hey! Is that...?

00:10:31,621 --> 00:10:33,748
[BLACK BULLS]
Here we are!

'Kay, so there's a magical

174
00:10:46,845 --> 00:10:48,513
space growin' over there.

175
00:10:48,596 --> 00:10:53,184
I don't really get the details,
but it's definitely bad news.

176
00:10:53,268 --> 00:10:56,187
[cackles] Sounds like our
cue to head that way.

177
00:10:56,271 --> 00:10:57,564
Huh?

178
00:11:01,359 --> 00:11:04,529
[KLAUS] You won't stop

Show me what you've got, then!

I'll shred you all

It's one thing after another.

Can't these jerks
just give us a break?

188
00:11:21,504 --> 00:11:22,839
[NOELLE]
Now what?

189
00:11:24,382 --> 00:11:25,425
[gasps]

190
00:11:29,929 --> 00:11:31,806
Hey! Is that...?

191
00:11:34,642 --> 00:11:37,812
[ASTA] I know this thing
looks scary, but it's just us!

00:11:37,896 --> 00:11:39,272
Also, don't freak out
when you see

193
00:11:39,356 --> 00:11:41,191
who we brought with us;
it's kind of a long story,

194
00:11:41,274 --> 00:11:43,026
but it's fine, I promise!

195
00:11:43,109 --> 00:11:44,527
Hey, look.

196
00:11:44,611 --> 00:11:48,782
What's with... that black...
castle... back there?

197
00:11:48,865 --> 00:11:51,701
Looks like Gauche is chillin'
on top of the enemy base!

198
00:11:51,785 --> 00:11:53,620
Our best friend needs us!

00:11:53,703 --> 00:11:56,748
[GREY] You guys!
This is so overwhelming!

Tell me where
Licht is right now!

[PATRY gasps]

202
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:06,383
A huge bull? No way!

203
00:12:06,466 --> 00:12:08,134
[YAMI]
There's our Henry.

204
00:12:08,218 --> 00:12:11,596
[laughs] Ya buncha dumbasses!

205
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,431
Better work on that entrance!

206
00:12:13,515 --> 00:12:16,559
Captain! Sorry to make you wait!

207
00:12:16,643 --> 00:12:19,312
Whoa, Finral's behind him,
totally passed out!

208
00:12:19,396 --> 00:12:21,815
Oh, no! I didn't even know
you woke up the first time--

209
00:12:21,898 --> 00:12:24,693
you can't turn around and go
back to sleep already, Finral!

210
00:12:24,776 --> 00:12:26,194
You'd better not
make us check you

211
00:12:26,277 --> 00:12:28,988
into the infirmary again
after you just got out!

212
00:12:29,072 --> 00:12:30,365
My cooking'll get everybody

213
00:12:30,448 --> 00:12:32,617
back in tip-top shape,
so I want all of you to pile

your plates up with
some yummy food!

215
00:12:35,161 --> 00:12:36,788
What took you guys so long?

216
00:12:36,871 --> 00:12:38,665
The next words out of
your mouth better be

217
00:12:38,748 --> 00:12:41,668
"Thank you for picking up
our slack!" you lazy idiots!

218
00:12:41,751 --> 00:12:44,504
[NOELLE]
Ugh, it was terrifying!

219
00:12:44,587 --> 00:12:47,007
[ASTA] Whoa, what's with
the new outfit, Noelle?

220
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:48,550
You look extra cool now!

Hey, you're the ones who almost

222
00:12:50,093 --> 00:12:51,344
got your butts kicked!

You should be
thankin' us, princess!

224
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,265
You care to explain
the walking house

225
00:12:55,348 --> 00:12:56,725
full of loud people?

226
00:12:56,808 --> 00:12:59,269
I wish I could, but this
is new for me, too.

227
00:12:59,352 --> 00:13:01,813
It seems like our squad
gets weirder every day.

228
00:13:01,896 --> 00:13:04,065
But everything's
gonna be okay now,

Black Bulls are here!

Curse you, humans!

231

Bring in whatever
reinforcements you like,

232
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:13,116
you're still no match
for the elves!

233
00:13:14,576 --> 00:13:15,744
Ready?

234
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:24,586
[LUCK] This spell gauges
the strength of their attack,

235
00:13:24,669 --> 00:13:26,713
and then together...

236
00:13:26,796 --> 00:13:29,090
[LUCK, MAGNA, GORDON, SALLY]
...we intercept it!

Now where's your leader?

240
00:13:37,682 --> 00:13:39,934
That's enough! Take this!

Good, now hurry and chow down

247
00:13:59,537 --> 00:14:03,500
so you can replenish all
the mana you just used!

248
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,960
[ASTA] I can't use magic,
but I'm gonna eat anyway!

249
00:14:06,044 --> 00:14:07,837
[RADES]
I don't see Licht anywhere!

havin' a snack

in the middle of a fight!

252
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,133
So what do you think of my team?

253
00:14:12,217 --> 00:14:13,968
Pretty tough, aren't they?

254
00:14:14,052 --> 00:14:15,679
I wanna cut them.

255
00:14:15,762 --> 00:14:18,056
[YAMI]
Whoa. Well, don't!

256
00:14:19,599 --> 00:14:22,143
Really? The Black Bulls?

257
00:14:22,227 --> 00:14:25,063
Even here, they stand in my way.

258
00:14:25,146 --> 00:14:29,067
That one's magic interferes
with the very laws of nature.

00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,944
So she's a witch!

260
00:14:31,027 --> 00:14:34,656
It would appear their defense
largely depends on her.

I'm going now. Goodbye.

Oh, Reve!

00:14:38,618 --> 00:14:41,579
Ah. I see, so you're
finally awake.

264
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:45,166
I can't believe it--you sleep
even more than Rhya does.

265
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,376
You gonna be okay?

266
00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:48,336
This'll be your first
spell in centuries,

267
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,672
your past life included.

268
00:14:50,755 --> 00:14:54,050
Who, me? Yes. I'm fine.

269
00:14:54,134 --> 00:14:56,761
[MIMOSA]
Black Bulls, can you hear me?

270
00:14:56,845 --> 00:14:58,138
[ASTA]
Mimosa's here, with her brother

271
00:14:58,221 --> 00:14:59,681
and that mushroom guy.

272
00:14:59,764 --> 00:15:00,932
If we don't do something,

273
00:15:01,016 --> 00:15:02,559
all of the Magic Knights
who've been possessed

274
00:15:02,642 --> 00:15:04,894
are going to lose
their souls forever!

We're running out of time, Asta!

276
00:15:07,272 --> 00:15:08,773
Seriously?

00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:16,072
My! Such magnificent magic!

00:15:16,156 --> 00:15:18,575
Don't tell me this ki
is what I think it is.

00:15:18,658 --> 00:15:21,661
[ASTA gasps]
I know her!

281
00:15:23,413 --> 00:15:25,874
That's the captain
of the Coral Peacocks!

282
00:15:25,957 --> 00:15:28,668
Did she get possessed, too?

[DOROTHY]
Dream Magic: Glamour World.

No way! What did she do?

285
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,683
[HENRY] I can sense the magic
of the pieces that vanished,

286
00:15:43,767 --> 00:15:46,186
but they don't exist anywhere.

287
00:15:46,269 --> 00:15:48,271
[ASTA]
Hey, we're missing some people!

288
00:15:48,355 --> 00:15:51,191
Vanessa, Magna,
Luck, Charmy, Sally!

289
00:15:51,274 --> 00:15:52,567
What did she do with everyone?

290
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:53,860
It's gorgeous!

291
00:15:53,943 --> 00:15:55,320
But the moment she activates it,

292
00:15:55,403 --> 00:15:57,697
her targets will cease
to exist in this world!

293
00:15:57,781 --> 00:16:00,200
They've been whisked away
to the World of Dreams.

294
00:16:00,283 --> 00:16:01,576
And once you're in,
there's nothing

295
00:16:01,659 --> 00:16:03,119
you can do to get out!

296
00:16:03,203 --> 00:16:06,373
There is. There must be!

297
00:16:06,456 --> 00:16:09,000
Well, I suppose that takes
care of their defense.

298
00:16:09,084 --> 00:16:11,628
All right, let's wrap
things up then.

And there's Gauche, too!

do that one thing now?

how this is gonna help!

00:16:53,795 --> 00:16:56,131
What, were you tryin' to do,
poison the whole squad?

316
00:16:56,214 --> 00:16:58,174
[mumbling] I was using
teamwork to help my friends

317
00:16:58,258 --> 00:17:00,010
in their time of need.

318
00:17:00,093 --> 00:17:01,845
[GAUCHE]
We can handle things here.

319
00:17:01,928 --> 00:17:04,723
Why don't you go ahead and meet
up with your precious Licht?

320
00:17:04,806 --> 00:17:07,017
I wish you wouldn't
say it like that.

321
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,602
But yes, I'm counting
on you, Droit.

322
00:17:09,686 --> 00:17:12,230
Sure. I'll catch ya later.

323
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:18,570
Ugh! Hey, Valtos!
Make me a portal!

324
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,284
Man, they're such jerks!

325
00:17:24,367 --> 00:17:33,209
[HENRY] Everyone...! You
should... get away... from me!

326
00:17:33,293 --> 00:17:36,004
[ASTA]
Henry! He got too far away

327
00:17:36,087 --> 00:17:37,630
from the Raging Black Bull!

328
00:17:37,714 --> 00:17:39,466
And without Charmy,
nobody can recharge

329
00:17:39,549 --> 00:17:42,093
their mana if it runs out!

330
00:17:42,177 --> 00:17:43,887
[NOELLE]
You guys!

331
00:17:47,307 --> 00:17:49,726
My armor. It vanished!

332
00:17:49,809 --> 00:17:52,771
Well, that crazy spell of
yours was kind of a doozy.

333
00:17:52,854 --> 00:17:56,149
Your body probably can't
keep up with it just yet.

334
00:17:56,232 --> 00:17:57,400
[ZORA]
Now that I think of it,

335
00:17:57,484 --> 00:18:00,236
I'm runnin' pretty
low on juice myself.

336
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,488
Oh, Asta.

337
00:18:01,571 --> 00:18:04,115
Goodness, you look even
more feeble than usual!

338
00:18:04,199 --> 00:18:06,117
[YAMI] I know the Black
Bulls need my help,

339
00:18:06,201 --> 00:18:09,621
but I can't let the bossman
slip through my fingers.

340
00:18:09,704 --> 00:18:12,082
Don't screw this up,
you hear me?

341
00:18:12,165 --> 00:18:14,501
I want you to surpass
your damn limits!

342
00:18:14,584 --> 00:18:16,628
--[GREY] Uh, okay sir!
--[ASTA] Yeah!

343
00:18:16,711 --> 00:18:19,589
Sounds good! I'll see ya
in a little bit, then!

344
00:18:19,673 --> 00:18:21,800
Time to go, Jack!

345
00:18:21,883 --> 00:18:25,470
[JACK] Since when am I
taking orders from you?

346
00:18:25,553 --> 00:18:28,723
[MARIE] Look, Brother,
some of them are gone.

347
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:30,517
[GAUCHE] Then we need to kill
the rest of them quickly

348
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,561
and hurry after
the ones who left.

349
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:35,313
That's where you come in, Eclat.

350
00:18:35,397 --> 00:18:37,649
It's time for a fun
game of hide-and-seek.

351
00:18:37,732 --> 00:18:39,067
Right.

352
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:42,153
[GAUCHE] Willpower won't be
enough to save them now.

353
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:56,001
[MARIE] I found them.
Look at me, humans.

354
00:18:57,627 --> 00:18:58,837
[GAUCHE]
Mirror Magic...

355
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,338
[MARIE]
Eye Magic...

356
00:19:00,422 --> 00:19:03,591
[GAUCHE, MARIE]
Combo Spell: Reflect Iris.

357
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:04,884
[gasps]

358
00:19:07,721 --> 00:19:09,472
[ASTA]
What's happening?

359
00:19:09,556 --> 00:19:11,266
[GREY]
Why can't I move?

360
00:19:11,349 --> 00:19:12,892
[GORDON]
We're stuck!

361
00:19:12,976 --> 00:19:15,603
[MIMOSA]
How is this possible?

362
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:16,980
[NOELLE]
My magic...

363
00:19:17,063 --> 00:19:18,648
[ZORA grunts]

364
00:19:18,732 --> 00:19:20,942
Little Eclat has the
ability to immobilize

365
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:23,028
anybody who looks into her eyes.

366
00:19:23,111 --> 00:19:26,322
It renders your magic
useless, as well.

367
00:19:26,406 --> 00:19:27,699
[ASTA]
What?

368
00:19:27,782 --> 00:19:30,744
But Marie doesn't even
have her grimoire yet!

369
00:19:30,827 --> 00:19:33,455
I guess the elves are
just that powerful!

370
00:19:33,538 --> 00:19:37,542
There's no hope for you.
Now die, helpless worms.

371
00:19:39,169 --> 00:19:42,589
[ASTA]
Not yet. I refuse to give up!

372
00:19:46,092 --> 00:19:48,803
[ASTA]
This is not the end!

373
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:52,265
I still have to turn Gauche
and Marie back to normal,

374
00:19:52,349 --> 00:19:54,184
not to mention everyone else!

375
00:19:54,267 --> 00:19:58,688
I'll set things right.
No matter what it takes!

376
00:19:58,772 --> 00:20:04,652
[ASTA growls, yells]

377
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:06,196
[gasps]

378
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:09,824
Hey, look at that. I can move!

379
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:12,577
He must've nullified the spell!

380
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:16,373
Asta... you... did it!

381
00:20:16,456 --> 00:20:18,958
Okay, you guys! Everyone ready?

382
00:20:19,042 --> 00:20:20,627
--[GORDON] All set!
--[GREY] Yes!

383
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:23,630
Hold on. That blade.

384
00:20:23,713 --> 00:20:26,549
Why does he have Licht's
Demon Destroyer Sword?

385
00:20:26,633 --> 00:20:28,802
You don't deserve that weapon!

386
00:20:28,885 --> 00:20:30,720
Give it back and die!

387
00:20:34,057 --> 00:20:36,101
[GREY]
I'll use Transformation Magic...

388
00:20:36,184 --> 00:20:38,144
Here!

389
00:20:38,228 --> 00:20:40,146
[GREY]
...to make more mirrors!

390
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:43,149
[GORDON]
Poison Magic: Forbidden Fruit!

391
00:20:47,028 --> 00:20:50,407
[ASTA growls, yells]

392
00:20:53,326 --> 00:20:55,328
[ASTA]
It may be stronger now,

393
00:20:55,412 --> 00:20:58,748
but I still understand
Gauche's magic really well!

394
00:20:58,832 --> 00:21:02,293
Actually, he kinda ticks me off!

395
00:21:02,377 --> 00:21:05,255
The way he used to shoot
those weird beams at me.

396
00:21:05,338 --> 00:21:06,798
You know, gettin'
possessed didn't change

397
00:21:06,881 --> 00:21:09,134
his personality much!

398
00:21:09,217 --> 00:21:11,469
Yes, I agree,
and after we save him,

399
00:21:11,553 --> 00:21:13,638
he'll go right back
to insulting us.

400
00:21:13,722 --> 00:21:15,098
That's exactly what'll happen,

401
00:21:15,181 --> 00:21:17,058
plus he'll keep showing us
pictures of his sister

402
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:18,810
and making dolls of her
and getting nosebleeds

403
00:21:18,893 --> 00:21:20,020
when he thinks about her.

404
00:21:20,103 --> 00:21:21,980
He's really not a fun
person to be around!

405
00:21:22,063 --> 00:21:28,778
He's... always...
been... creepy!

406
00:21:28,862 --> 00:21:30,822
[ALL] That's why we need
to bring back the Gauche

407
00:21:30,905 --> 00:21:34,451
we all know, so we can
complain to his face!

[RHYA]
Part 1.

411
00:23:24,185 --> 00:23:25,687
There's not much time.

412
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:28,189
I was in a bit of a
rush to take you out,

413
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:31,317
which means your bodies are
gonna be pretty puny now.

414
00:23:31,401 --> 00:23:33,653
[BOTH crying]

415
00:23:33,737 --> 00:23:37,657
[RHYA] Okay, I probably
shouldn't have jumped the gun.

416
00:23:37,741 --> 00:23:39,117
Part 2.

417
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:44,497
[RHYA] I had plenty of time
to spare, so I let 'em steep.

418
00:23:44,581 --> 00:23:47,917
Vetto and Fana should be more
mature this time around.

419
00:23:49,711 --> 00:23:51,504
[VETTO] I don't know what
happened to me before...

420
00:23:51,588 --> 00:23:54,924
[RHYA] We gotta find some
kinda happy medium here!

[GORDON]
My best friend, Gauche Adlai.

422
00:23:59,012 --> 00:24:01,598
Your little sister is
basically my little sister.

423
00:24:01,681 --> 00:24:04,601
That's right! Marie
is my actual sister!
