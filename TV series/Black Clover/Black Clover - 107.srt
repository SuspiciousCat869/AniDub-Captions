That won't help you.

161
00:09:13,293 --> 00:09:15,378
Your attacks are
all so predictable!

It's takin' all I got
to stay one step ahead!

Ah! This is a real blast!

Hey, Jack.

00:09:52,707 --> 00:09:55,126
What's the next idea in
that sick ol head o' yours?

173
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:57,545
Keh. Same thing you're thinkin',

and that's Severing
Magic: Death Scythe!

I already told you, your

[GOLEM ARMOR screams]

177
00:10:07,013 --> 00:10:09,516
There's nothing in the
world that I can't sever.

178
00:10:09,599 --> 00:10:11,851
But are you even
worth slashing up?

179
00:10:11,935 --> 00:10:14,479
Prove it to me!

180
00:10:14,562 --> 00:10:15,689
Wait, what?

181
00:10:15,772 --> 00:10:18,483
The property of the
magic changed somehow!

But how?

190
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:44,676
[FINRAL] All right!
Great job as always, you two!

191

You're really gettin' the hang
of this stuff, aren't ya?

192
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:48,638
Not too shabby, Finral.

193
00:10:48,722 --> 00:10:50,515
If you can back
me up in a fight,

194
00:10:50,598 --> 00:10:53,059
you must not be
completely incompetent.

Uh. Thanks a lot.

Man, this guy's scary.

They both are!

[JACK] Come on, let me
borrow him sometime.

No way, get your own door guy.

202
00:11:07,532 --> 00:11:09,409
This is super fun and all,

203
00:11:09,492 --> 00:11:10,910
but we should get going.

204

[ROYAL 107B]
You're the Magic Knights!

What is the meaning of this?

Don't they know they're
in the royal palace?

212
00:11:33,016 --> 00:11:36,019
We gathered here to curry favor
with the House of Silva

213

to see if they would grant
us a share of their power!

You really lost to Noelle?
That's pathetic, Solid.

It sounds like you let your

Your house is a mess,
so you might wanna

317
00:16:36,736 --> 00:16:38,405
go take care of that.

318
00:16:38,488 --> 00:16:41,116
[cackles] Get your butts
inside or we're going to hog

319
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,493
all the carnage for ourselves!

320
00:16:44,869 --> 00:16:47,038
Such nerve from those
without royal blood!

321
00:16:47,122 --> 00:16:48,456
Don't mind them.

322
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,250
For what it's worth,
you're one of the few people

323
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,419
I've always considered
to be beautiful!

324
00:16:52,502 --> 00:16:54,462
Silence. That does not help.

325
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:57,298
Do whatever you need
to do to fix your house.

326
00:16:57,382 --> 00:17:00,844
We're gonna go find
ol' King Clover!

327
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,470
They're strong,
so don't be a hero

328
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:04,597
and try to take 'em
down on your own.

329
00:17:04,681 --> 00:17:07,183
Your only goal is to
rescue and retreat!

330
00:17:07,267 --> 00:17:09,019
[JACK] Who the hell died
and made you boss?

331
00:17:09,102 --> 00:17:10,562
[YAMI]
Oh, shut up!

332
00:17:10,645 --> 00:17:13,189
None of you idiots is
allowed to get killed!

333
00:17:13,273 --> 00:17:16,568
You're the last person I
needed to hear that from.

334
00:17:19,904 --> 00:17:21,448
[NOELLE]
I'm home again.

335
00:17:21,531 --> 00:17:22,574
I never thought
it would be under

336
00:17:22,657 --> 00:17:24,784
these circumstances though.

337
00:17:27,412 --> 00:17:28,329
[NOZEL grunts]

338
00:17:28,413 --> 00:17:29,706
So cruel!

339
00:17:29,789 --> 00:17:32,876
How dare those monsters
taint our castle with blood?

340
00:17:32,959 --> 00:17:35,086
They will regret this day.

341
00:17:36,463 --> 00:17:37,547
[gasps]

342
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,174
In case you forgot,
I don't give a crap

343
00:17:39,257 --> 00:17:42,302
about you stuck-up royals
and your fancy digs,

344
00:17:42,385 --> 00:17:44,846
so I'm gonna do what I want!

345
00:17:44,929 --> 00:17:47,015
[ZORA] Considering how
many we're up against,

346
00:17:47,098 --> 00:17:48,683
we gotta move smart.

347
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:49,768
Hey, wait!

348
00:17:49,851 --> 00:17:51,436
Nobody said you could do that!

349
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:53,688
Just let him go.

350
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:56,649
He was selected to become
one of the Royal Knights,

351
00:17:56,733 --> 00:17:59,444
so I'm sure he has
his own fighting style.

352
00:17:59,527 --> 00:18:01,029
Ready yourself.

353
00:18:02,697 --> 00:18:04,949
There you are, royals!

354
00:18:07,911 --> 00:18:10,955
You ready for your punishment?

355
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,957
[NOZEL] I'd ask you
the same, but it appears

356
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:15,251
you're incapacitated.

357
00:18:15,335 --> 00:18:17,003
[NOELLE] With fine mana
control, he can make

358
00:18:17,087 --> 00:18:19,547
free-transforming mercury
magic work for attack

359
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:23,760
and defense at the same time.
Nozel really is talented.

360
00:18:31,601 --> 00:18:34,062
[NOELLE]
Mother.

361
00:18:34,145 --> 00:18:37,691
We're going to take down
the strongest first.

362
00:18:37,774 --> 00:18:39,609
That's Solid's room!

363
00:18:42,112 --> 00:18:44,197
[yells]

364
00:18:46,282 --> 00:18:48,034
[SOLID] The magic coming
off of those compasses

365
00:18:48,118 --> 00:18:50,245
is blocking me from
landing a hit!

366
00:18:50,328 --> 00:18:54,249
What do I do? This
can't be happening!

367
00:18:54,332 --> 00:18:56,167
[yells]

368
00:18:56,251 --> 00:18:59,796
[SOLID] Water Creation Magic:
Sea Serpent's Coils!

369
00:19:01,047 --> 00:19:02,757
[yelps, groans]

370
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:06,761
This is getting me
nowhere! Now what?

371
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:08,138
Be careful.

372
00:19:08,221 --> 00:19:10,515
[SOLID]
We are royalty, you know!

373
00:19:10,598 --> 00:19:14,894
You mentioned that.
Face your fate.

374
00:19:14,978 --> 00:19:17,439
No!

375
00:19:23,069 --> 00:19:25,155
Nozel, it's you!

376
00:19:25,238 --> 00:19:25,989
[gasps]

377
00:19:26,072 --> 00:19:27,991
[SOLID]
And Noelle!

378
00:19:28,074 --> 00:19:29,367
[NOELLE]
Mana Skin!

379
00:19:29,451 --> 00:19:33,246
Water Creation Magic:
Sea Dragon's Roar!

380
00:19:34,497 --> 00:19:35,623
[NOELLE]
I've got her!

381
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:39,836
Now Compass Magic:
Willful Compass!

382
00:19:41,838 --> 00:19:43,548
[NOELLE]
She deflected it!

383
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:46,384
[SOLID]
Not even the spell Noelle used

384
00:19:46,468 --> 00:19:49,763
to defeat me could
break through that mana.

385
00:19:49,846 --> 00:19:51,681
I knew you would come.

386
00:19:51,765 --> 00:19:55,268
Thank you, Nozel. Sincerely.

387
00:19:55,352 --> 00:19:58,438
[NEBRA] I can't believe Noelle
managed a spell like that.

388
00:19:58,521 --> 00:20:02,275
But it still wasn't enough.

389
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:04,778
I hate to admit it,
but in my state,

390
00:20:04,861 --> 00:20:06,613
I'd only hold them back.

391
00:20:06,696 --> 00:20:09,866
It's better if I just retreat.

392
00:20:09,949 --> 00:20:14,162
Mist Magic: Bewildering
Forest of Mist!

393
00:20:14,245 --> 00:20:16,206
All of you will die here.

394
00:20:16,289 --> 00:20:19,292
[KIVN]
Compass Magic: Another Atlas!

395
00:20:24,464 --> 00:20:26,591
The only way you're
escaping this room alive

396
00:20:26,675 --> 00:20:29,886
is if you can defeat me first!

397
00:20:29,969 --> 00:20:33,765
[NOZEL] What? I don't have
control of my magic!

398
00:20:33,848 --> 00:20:35,850
This technique
forcibly disturbs any

399
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:38,061
and all magic in a given area.

400
00:20:38,144 --> 00:20:40,730
No matter how powerful
your own abilities may be,

401
00:20:40,814 --> 00:20:44,567
human, you will never be
able to put a scratch on me!

402
00:20:44,651 --> 00:20:45,985
And yet...

403
00:20:49,614 --> 00:20:51,866
[yelps]

404
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:56,496
My spells will hit you.
Without fail!

405
00:20:56,579 --> 00:20:58,748
Stop her, Nozel! Please!

406
00:20:58,832 --> 00:21:00,792
Stay there, Solid.

407
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:03,420
You'd only hold us
back as you are now.

408
00:21:03,503 --> 00:21:06,256
I will handle this.

409
00:21:06,339 --> 00:21:11,511
[NOELLE]
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

410
00:21:11,594 --> 00:21:13,805
I went through
all that training.

411
00:21:13,888 --> 00:21:17,183
I'll succeed. I can do it!

412
00:21:17,267 --> 00:21:20,228
I won't let you hurt
my family anymore!

413
00:21:22,522 --> 00:21:25,191
Let's show her
our power, Noelle.

414
00:21:25,275 --> 00:21:27,610
The House Silva stands strong!

[JACK]
"Jack the Amazing."

417
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:09,254
There's nothing that
I can't sever.

418
00:23:09,337 --> 00:23:11,089
But are you worth cutting up?

419
00:23:11,172 --> 00:23:12,632
You've got to prove it!

420
00:23:12,716 --> 00:23:14,676
With meat like this,
you want to cut it

421
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:17,220
into strips of just
the right size.

422

Death Scythe.

423
00:23:18,346 --> 00:23:20,181
All right, what to cut next?

424
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:21,641
Show me you're worth it!

425
00:23:21,725 --> 00:23:24,185
The best way to
prepare tofu is diced!

426
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:26,646
Into nice, scrumptious
little cubes!

427
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:29,607
Oh, hey. That's how
I like my victims, too.

Death Scythe.

429
00:23:31,192 --> 00:23:35,196
I'm on a roll! I could
carve up stuff all day!

430
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,449
They're supposed to be
"bite-sized" pieces,

431
00:23:37,532 --> 00:23:40,076
but I've got a big mouth,
so it's tricky!

432
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,327
Death Scythe.

433
00:23:41,411 --> 00:23:44,247
Don't let it boil over
when you add the miso.

434
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:48,835
Ta-dah! It's Jack the Ripper's
famous pork miso soup!

435
00:23:48,918 --> 00:23:50,045
Ah!

436
00:23:51,087 --> 00:23:55,467
[JACK] Oh, no! I forgot
to put in the soup stock!

437
00:23:56,843 --> 00:23:58,094
[NARRATOR]
Once, there was a girl called

438
00:23:58,178 --> 00:23:59,679
the Steel Warrior Princess,

439
00:23:59,763 --> 00:24:02,390
known for dancing
gracefully through combat.

440
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:05,643
<i>Black Clover</i> , Page 108:
"Battlefield Dancer."

441
00:24:05,727 --> 00:24:09,606
Now, it is Noelle Silva's turn
to dance across the battlefield.
