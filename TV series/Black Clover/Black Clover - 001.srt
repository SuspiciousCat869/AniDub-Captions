Aw, shh. There's a good boy.

Here you go.

00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:42,875
[HIGH PRIEST grunts]
I was starting to think

7
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:44,833
you would never calm down.

8
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:51,833
Are you brothers?

9
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:55,041
Same age, so possibly
twins as well.

10
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:56,875
No, they're neither.

11
00:00:56,958 --> 00:00:59,166
This one here is sweet
and well behaved,

12
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,750
and this one, well,
he's a bit spirited.

13
00:01:04,458 --> 00:01:05,666
Then there's the fact

14
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,583
that they don't
look a thing alike.

but your worries are over.

[VILLAGER 1B] The kid from

One day, I'll be
the Wizard King.

And I'll make you the

Will you please marry me?

I'm sorry, Asta. I just can't.

Yes, it is. I can't marry you.

your nose in this, Yuno?

That's simple, really.

60
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:25,125
Because you're noisy,
you're short, you lack both

61
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:28,625
composure and tolerance,
and there's not really anything

Hey!

Fifteen years of
growing up together,

65

Thank you, Yuno.

You think you can
just ignore me?

70
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:46,125
[YUNO] Asta, nuns are
women of the cloth,

71
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:47,875
which means they can't marry.

72

Neither can 15-year-old
boys, in fact.

Think you're so smart.

Well, I'll show you.

It is pretty crazy.

Not being able to use any
kind of magic at his age?

That never happens.

that, in this world,

magic is everything?

100

It's not a matter of whether
you have it, but how much.

You're the only person
I've ever heard of

Just wait and see, Asta.

magic in no time at all.

Well, probably, anyway.

132

[ASTA] My grimoire...
I'll have it soon.

That's right!

I'm gonna get the most
awesome grimoire ever!

136
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:13,500
I'll join up with the
Magic Knights, and once I make

137
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,958
a name for myself, I'll
follow in your footsteps

138
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,958
and become the Wizard King!

139
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:20,166
He'll never give up
this nonsense, will he?

140
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,708
[ASTA] And then I'll
come back and rebuild

141
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:23,791
this crumbling dump of a church.

142
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:27,916
[HIGH PRIEST growls] Crumbling
dump? That's taking it too far!

Isn't that right, Yuno?

144
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:32,750
Eh?

145
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:44,625
I'll show all of you.

I swear!

Just watch and
you'll see, damn you!

How am I younger than him?

[LILY]
Hey, Yuno.

151
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,375
Do you think you could maybe try

152
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:07,625
to get along a little
better with Asta?

153
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:10,416
I mean, like you used to
back when you were younger.

154
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,208
You two were always together.

155
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:15,250
[LILY]
Yuno used to be such a crybaby.

156
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:18,250
But then, one day,
he came back with Asta,

157
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,333
who was badly injured.

158
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:24,375
And since then, I haven't
seen him cry once.

159
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:26,875
[YUNO]
What's the point?

160
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,458
There's no getting
along with that one.

161

they were both
different afterwards.

164
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:37,833
That's when Asta started coming
home covered in mud every day.

165
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,583
I wonder where he goes off
to and what he's doing.

[ASTA]
I will be the Wizard King.

Nothing's going to stop me.

00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,958

float through the air.

Once a year throughout
the Clover Kingdom,

182
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:35,208
those children who have
reached 15 years of age

gather for the Grimoire
Acceptance Ceremony,

184
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:41,875
a rite of passage that will
increase their magical power.

Ooh! Which one is mine?

[ASTA] Once I get my

I'm gonna be able
to use magic, too.

Hmph.

The day that I'll become
a full-fledged mage.

It's about time!

Look what the cat dragged in.

Could they be any shabbier?

We shouldn't have to
give grimoires to anyone

off the street.

You don't think the

foolish enough to attempt the
Magic Knights Entrance Exam

[BOY 1A]
Oh, wow.

We'd better take
extra special care of him.

207
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,833
I mean, he's one of a kind!

208
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:36,750
The only person in the entire
country who can't use magic.

Welcome to Grimoire

For those who don't know,

I am the master of
this Grimoire Tower.

Now, never once has
anyone from this region

by becoming a Magic Knight,
much less the Wizard King.

what it takes to become the most
powerful mage in the land.

Finally, my very own grimoire!

00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:42,625
Resisting would be a
foolish waste of your time.

317
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,916
My Magic Binding Iron Chain
Formation spell blocks

318
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,875
its captives'
movement and magic.

319
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:51,250
What do you want? Who are you?

320
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:54,416
[REVCHI chuckles] I suppose
a village boy wouldn't know,

321
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,166
but until very recently,
I was relatively well known

322
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:00,458
among the Magic Knight squads
as Chain Magic Revchi.

323
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:02,875
But they expelled me from
their illustrious ranks,

324
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:05,541
and now I am naught
but a humble thief.

325
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:06,916
So, if you'll excuse me,

326
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,250
I'll be taking this
grimoire of yours.

327
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:12,208
[REVCHI laughs]

328
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:14,750
You said that your
name was Revchi?

329
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:16,125
Why bother stealing it?

330
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,791
There's no point. Grimoi--

331
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:20,083
Grimoires must be used
by their chosen masters.

332
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:22,208
Yes, village boy,
I'm well aware.

333
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:24,875
That said, there are plenty
of black-market collectors

334
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:26,833
who would pay a small
fortune in exchange

335
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:28,666
for such a unique specimen.

336
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,500
The four-leaf clover
may have chosen you,

337
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:31,958
but you only received it.

338
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:34,125
An untrained novice,
a mere hatchling.

339
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:36,125
This is not your lucky day.

340
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:38,583
Such a pity for you
I happened to be here.

341
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:42,541
Your legend is over
before it even began.

342
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:43,916
O-ho.

343
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,583
I bet that pendant would
fetch a good price.

344
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:48,166
Don't mind if I do.

345
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,041
[ASTA]
Hold it!

346
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:54,291
[ASTA yells]

347
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:03,791
What the hell is going on here?

348
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:05,333
I've come to rescue--

349
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:10,708
[ASTA]
Hey, creep, what's your deal?

350
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:12,708
That's Yuno's grimoire
you've got.

351
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:17,458
What are you doing with it?
You dirty, rotten thief!

352
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:19,250
Why, look, it's the
sad little boy

353
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:21,208
who waited so long,
but never got a grimoire.

354
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:22,541
[ASTA]
Oh, you've heard of me?

355
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:26,041
Yeah, you're right.
The poor, empty-handed kid.

356
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:27,625
The only place
a grimoire belongs

357
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:31,541
is with its true master.
Now give that back to Yuno!

358
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:34,625
[laughs]

359
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:36,375
You really are a
sheltered creature

360
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:37,791
if you believe that
kind of reasoning

361
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:40,375
will get you anywhere
with the likes of me.

362
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:44,250
Allow me to disabuse
you of that notion.

363
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:45,708
Asta, run!

364
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:49,375
[REVCHI laughs]

365
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:51,375
From a waste of space like him?

366
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:54,041
Not a chance in hell!

367
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,708
[yells]

368
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,750
[ASTA]
I'll get you!

369
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:14,583
No, boy. You're finished here.

370
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:21,041
[REVCHI]
Dance of the Pitless Viper!

371
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:30,416
[ASTA]
That's one serious attack.

372
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:36,416
[ASTA] So this... is what mages
outside the village can do...

373
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,291
Even as much as I've
trained my body,

374
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:40,875
I don't stand a chance.

375
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:43,208
[REVCHI]
You see, boy, it's no use.

376
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:45,000
Thanks for playing, though!

377
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,958
It's not over. I'm not done.

378
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:50,875
I will be the Wizard King.

379
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:54,083
[REVCHI]
The Wizard King? You're joking.

380
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,208
The thing is, these
chains can measure

381
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:59,125
the magic power of anyone
they come in contact with.

382
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:02,166
And you have none,
not a single drop.

383
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,416
[gasps]

384
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,125
You were probably born that way.

385
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:08,250
I guess this explains why
you didn't get a grimoire.

386
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,875
To possess not the slightest
bit of magic in a world

387
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,458
where magic is everything?

388
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:15,833
Why, that makes you a rare
and precious bird, indeed!

389
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:18,791
[REVCHI laughs]

390
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:22,416
[ASTA]
If that's true, then...

391
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,083
No matter how hard
I push myself,

392
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:28,041
I'll never be able to use magic.

393
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,541
You know, I really
can't think of

394
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,208
anything more pitiful.

395
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:32,916
Forget about becoming
the Wizard King,

396
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,708
you'll be lucky
to just get a job.

397
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:36,666
I bet your friend,
the genius over there,

398
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:41,125
is having a good laugh at
your expense right about now.

399
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:43,333
[ASTA]
Yeah, maybe.

400
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:47,041
Yuno's so great, the
four-leaf clover chose him.

401
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,291
Then there's me.

402
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:50,541
This world has no use
for someone like you,

403
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,250
a poor, magic-less fool.

404
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,625
You might as well give
it all up right now.

405
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:58,041
You were born a loser,
you worthless runt.

406
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:00,666
[ASTA]
Yeah. He's right.

407
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,875
No matter how hard I try,

408
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:06,166
I guess there are some things
that just aren't possible.

409
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,500
[ASTA]
So, I might as well give--

410
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:13,208
[YUNO] Hey! Who are
you calling a loser?

411
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:14,708
Asta.

412
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:17,666
It's true that you aren't going
to become the Wizard King.

413
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,041
Not ever.

414
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:20,416
[REVCHI]
You hear that?

415
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,166
Even your little friend
knows that it's impossible.

416
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,875
That's because I am going
to be the Wizard King.

417
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:31,583
[REVCHI]
What?

418
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:34,208
You're wrong about Asta, Revchi.

419
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:37,708
[YUNO]
Very wrong.

420
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:40,208
Asta's no loser. He's my rival!

421
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:41,708
[ASTA gasps]

422
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:42,916
Huh?

423
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,791
This is who you would
claim as your rival?

424
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:48,041
The only person in the
world without magic?

425
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:52,958
You. Get off of me.

426
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:54,500
[REVCHI gasps]

427
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:58,791
[ASTA] Sorry you had to see me
at such a weak moment, Yuno.

428
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:01,416
Just, give me a second.

429
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,208
That's all. Then I'll
destroy this guy.

430
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:21,375
[ASTA]
Is that... a grimoire?

431
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,416
[YUNO]
I knew it.

432
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,208
Like you wouldn't
be chosen, Asta?

433
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:27,875
There's no way.

434
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:37,583
[REVCHI]
Is that your magic?

435
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:43,333
But I checked, and you
didn't have any magic power.

436
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:47,041
How could you be
granted a grimoire?

437
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:48,750
[NARRATOR]
The leaves of a clover are said

438

to each contain one thing.

00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:54,500
In the first three dwell
integrity, hope, and love.

And in the fifth...

[NARRATOR]
...there lives the devil.

444
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:50,166
[ASTA] I'm not gonna give up
just because I can't use magic!

445
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:52,708
Commoner, orphan,
we all have a chance

446
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:54,125
