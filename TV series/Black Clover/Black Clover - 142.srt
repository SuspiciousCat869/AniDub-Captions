00:00:22,303 --> 00:00:23,930
[NARRATOR]
The Clover Kingdom.

2
00:00:24,014 --> 00:00:26,474
In this place where
magic is everything,

3
00:00:26,558 --> 00:00:29,436
there lives a magicless
boy named Asta.

4
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,313
This brave young hero devotes
blood, sweat, and tears

5
00:00:32,397 --> 00:00:34,399
to becoming the
next Wizard King.

6
00:00:34,482 --> 00:00:37,902
Though Asta's situation
is practically unheard of,

7
00:00:37,986 --> 00:00:39,904
there are others
residing in this kingdom

8
00:00:39,988 --> 00:00:42,532
who possess at least
a tiny amount of mana,

9
00:00:42,615 --> 00:00:45,035
yet can barely use
spells at all.

10
00:00:45,118 --> 00:00:47,746
They make up a very
small minority,

11
00:00:47,829 --> 00:00:50,248
living their lives
in the shadows.

12
00:00:53,752 --> 00:00:56,546
[NARRATOR]
But, like everyone else,

13
00:00:56,629 --> 00:00:59,257
they do their best to survive.

14
00:02:35,228 --> 00:02:37,313
[NARRATOR] These events
took place just before

15
00:02:37,397 --> 00:02:41,192
the Eye of the Midnight Sun
attacked the royal capital.

16
00:02:41,276 --> 00:02:44,362
The setting is a town that
was neither rich nor poor.

17
00:02:44,446 --> 00:02:46,698
Neither large nor small.

18
00:02:46,781 --> 00:02:48,825
Just an ordinary place,

19
00:02:48,908 --> 00:02:51,327
located somewhere within
the Common Realm.

20
00:03:11,348 --> 00:03:12,515
Ow.

21
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:15,352
Try to be strong.
It should heal up quickly.

22
00:03:18,104 --> 00:03:19,064
[DAZU]
Thank you.

23
00:03:19,147 --> 00:03:21,775
[BOW]
Sure thing.

24
00:03:21,858 --> 00:03:23,735
Hey. It's all right.

25
00:03:23,818 --> 00:03:25,153
Heh.

26
00:03:34,245 --> 00:03:35,830
I should go now.

27
00:03:35,914 --> 00:03:39,793
No one'll be here for a while.
You're very welcome to stay.

28
00:03:39,876 --> 00:03:43,546
I would love to, but he'll
be coming back home soon.

29
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,756
I see.

30
00:03:46,508 --> 00:03:47,842
Well, goodbye.

31
00:03:47,926 --> 00:03:49,302
See you later.

32
00:04:19,749 --> 00:04:23,086
Another great meal.
Thanks a lot, Dazu.

33
00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:24,462
Of course.

34
00:04:24,546 --> 00:04:26,548
[MESHU]
It really is delicious!

35
00:04:26,631 --> 00:04:30,468
You're a wonderful cook.
I'll give you that much.

36
00:04:30,552 --> 00:04:31,720
Got that right!

37
00:04:31,803 --> 00:04:33,513
Oh, dear. What a shame.

38
00:04:33,596 --> 00:04:35,098
We were sitting here
talking so long

39
00:04:35,181 --> 00:04:37,142
that my soup seems
to have gotten cold.

40
00:04:37,225 --> 00:04:39,644
Sorry, I'll go
reheat it for you.

41
00:04:39,728 --> 00:04:42,188
[MESHU] There's no need to walk
all the way to the kitchen.

42
00:04:42,272 --> 00:04:46,317
It'll be much easier to
warm it up with your magic.

43
00:04:46,401 --> 00:04:47,944
Go on.

44
00:04:48,028 --> 00:04:49,279
Okay.

45
00:04:49,362 --> 00:04:51,281
I'll need your
Flame Magic, Mother,

46
00:04:51,364 --> 00:04:52,657
and I hope you won't
mind lending me

47
00:04:52,741 --> 00:04:55,076
your Spatial Magic
as well, dear.

48
00:05:05,795 --> 00:05:08,798
Ah! Thank you,
that's much better!

49
00:05:08,882 --> 00:05:12,927
That Catalyst Magic of yours
really does come in handy.

50
00:05:13,011 --> 00:05:14,846
[VIDE] I wish I could borrow
other people's magic

51
00:05:14,929 --> 00:05:18,183
to use for my own purposes!
That's a valuable skill!

52
00:05:18,266 --> 00:05:19,351
[chuckles]

53
00:05:19,434 --> 00:05:21,269
It certainly is.

00:05:22,854 --> 00:05:24,981
My, that's good!

Prepare to suffer
the wrath of the elves.

[VILLAGER 142A]
Look at that!

It's the Captain
Golden Dawn's magic!

[VILLAGER 142AA]
Beautiful.

73
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:19,846
[VILLAGER 142B] That must mean
the kingdom is saved, right?

74
00:08:04,224 --> 00:08:05,725

[DAZU]
"The Devil's Servants"?

77
00:08:10,355 --> 00:08:13,024
It says "Members of the Magic
Knights were recently suspected

78
00:08:13,108 --> 00:08:15,902
of communicating with a devil
and using forbidden spells.

79
00:08:15,985 --> 00:08:19,739
The accused will soon face trial
by the Magic Parliament."

80
00:08:19,823 --> 00:08:21,491
That attack we suffered.

81
00:08:21,574 --> 00:08:23,660
It looks like it was just
one of many incidents

82
00:08:23,743 --> 00:08:25,495
that affected
the entire kingdom.

83
00:08:25,578 --> 00:08:27,956
Rumor has it, the
only reason they did

84
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:30,667
all those terrible things
was because a powerful devil

85
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,795
assumed possession of
their bodies somehow.

86
00:08:33,878 --> 00:08:37,215
[DAZU]
What? They were possessed?

87
00:08:37,298 --> 00:08:40,218
A devil did this?

88
00:08:49,394 --> 00:08:50,812
[JULIUS]
I'm asking each one of you

89
00:08:50,895 --> 00:08:53,815
to make sure your squads
are as strong as you can.

90
00:08:53,898 --> 00:08:55,400
We only have six months,

91
00:08:55,483 --> 00:08:57,068
but please do
everything possible

92
00:08:57,152 --> 00:08:59,154
to raise their stages to one.

93
00:08:59,237 --> 00:09:02,657
We must defeat Spade to protect
the residents of Heart,

94
00:09:02,741 --> 00:09:05,493
as well as our own kingdom.

95

Does this arrangement
work for you?

00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,247
How do you mean, sir?

97
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:11,875
[JULIUS] As we established,
the Magic Knights need to train

98
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:14,002
for the next six months
in order to be successful

99
00:09:14,085 --> 00:09:16,463
in their battle
against the devil.

100
00:09:16,546 --> 00:09:19,174
Asta's still waiting
to receive a sentence,

101
00:09:19,257 --> 00:09:20,925
but surely you can
table that decision

102
00:09:21,009 --> 00:09:24,346
until after this
is dealt with, yes?

103
00:09:24,429 --> 00:09:26,556
I suppose I don't object.

104
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,894
[KABWE]
What is the meaning of this?

105
00:09:30,977 --> 00:09:34,814
Asta of the Black Bulls
and that damned Nero woman!

106
00:09:34,898 --> 00:09:36,733
They're servants of the devil!

107
00:09:36,816 --> 00:09:39,319
We can't let them roam
free for six months!

108
00:09:39,402 --> 00:09:41,154
As I explained before:

109
00:09:41,237 --> 00:09:43,698
what matters right now
is that we cooperate

110
00:09:43,782 --> 00:09:45,742
with the Heart Kingdom
and the Magic Knights.

111
00:09:45,825 --> 00:09:47,911
It's crucial that we
maintain a unified front

112
00:09:47,994 --> 00:09:50,205
in the face of that devil
and the Spade Kingdom.

--[KABWE] Sir--!
--It's already decided.

Forgive me for saying
so, Lord Damnatio,

115
00:09:54,918 --> 00:09:57,462
but I can't believe that
you'd approve of this!

116
00:09:57,545 --> 00:09:59,255
[DAMNATIO]
That's because I don't.

117
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:01,424
However, there are
many complicated factors

118
00:10:01,508 --> 00:10:04,386
in play here.
More important things.

119
00:10:04,469 --> 00:10:06,763
The only thing more important
is executing the devil

who caused this mess!

121
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:09,474
There are many parties to blame

122
00:10:09,557 --> 00:10:12,268
for what the Eye of the
Midnight Sun did to our Kingdom,

123
00:10:12,352 --> 00:10:15,063
but that devil was
at the root of it all!

124
00:10:15,146 --> 00:10:17,232
They killed my nephew, sir!

125
00:10:17,315 --> 00:10:18,108
Enough.

I'm sorry, sir!

127

But we need to put these
vicious criminals to death.

It's the only way for us
to protect our people!

wrapped around
his little finger.

134

We can't let the devil's

for half a year. That's insane!

The scales of justice have
tipped into the darkness.

back into the light,

I'm sorry to hear that.

160
00:11:53,286 --> 00:11:56,790
We're looking for revenge,
for all the victims.

161
00:11:56,873 --> 00:11:59,459
And we're going to need
your help to achieve it!

162
00:11:59,542 --> 00:12:03,630
You want me to help?
What do you intend to do?

163
00:12:06,049 --> 00:12:08,510
My intent--or ours, rather--

164
00:12:08,593 --> 00:12:12,180
is to destroy the devil's
servants with our own hands.

165
00:12:12,263 --> 00:12:15,684
The devil's servants?
Are you serious?

166
00:12:15,767 --> 00:12:19,062
I'll need to hear your plans
in a bit more detail.

167
00:12:19,145 --> 00:12:20,188
Of course.

168
00:12:20,271 --> 00:12:21,648
Let's discuss.

169
00:12:31,116 --> 00:12:33,076
[NARRATOR] In the wake of the
Eye of the Midnight Sun's

170
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:36,037
attack, order was
returning to the capital.

171
00:12:36,121 --> 00:12:38,289
Wizard King Julius
Novachrono was swamped

172
00:12:38,373 --> 00:12:40,875
with paperwork from
the rebuilding effort.

173
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,628
Meanwhile, the Magic Knight
squads each engaged

174
00:12:43,712 --> 00:12:45,839
in their own vigorous
training regimens

175
00:12:45,922 --> 00:12:47,590
in preparation for
their coming battles

176
00:12:47,674 --> 00:12:50,010
with the Spade
Kingdom and the devil.

177
00:12:51,928 --> 00:12:53,596
Hurry up, what's wrong?

178
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,682
--[panting]
--Quit stalling and come at me!

179
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:59,352
It's nothing,
but a little water

180
00:12:59,436 --> 00:13:01,062
would be pretty good right now.

181
00:13:01,146 --> 00:13:02,981
Why don't we take
a break for a while?

182
00:13:03,064 --> 00:13:05,066
But I'm still not
thirsty at all, though!

183
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,068
[NOELLE] I say it's time
for a water break,

184
00:13:07,152 --> 00:13:09,487
and I'm royalty, so I'm right!

185
00:13:09,571 --> 00:13:11,197
[ASTA]
You're always bringing that up.

186
00:13:11,281 --> 00:13:13,742
What does you being royalty have
to do with anything either way?

187
00:13:13,825 --> 00:13:17,746
I said I need a break,
so I'm gonna take a break, okay?

188
00:13:17,829 --> 00:13:20,749
If you're not thirsty, then
don't come with me, idiot!

189
00:13:20,832 --> 00:13:23,168
I'm not sure what she's
gettin' so mad at me for.

190
00:13:23,251 --> 00:13:24,252
D'you know?

191
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:25,462
Nope.

192
00:13:25,545 --> 00:13:28,006
Oh, well, might as well
work out, then, huh?

Ah.

[FINRAL sighs]

196
00:13:40,935 --> 00:13:42,604
Oh. Hey, you guys.

197
00:13:42,687 --> 00:13:44,439
Man, water sounds
good right now.

198
00:13:44,522 --> 00:13:46,191
Think you could pour me a glass?

199
00:13:46,274 --> 00:13:48,276
No, pour it yourself.

200
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,111
[FINRAL]
You know I outrank you.

201
00:13:51,571 --> 00:13:53,656
[GAUCHE]
It's quieter than usual.

202
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,783
[NOELLE] That's because
everybody's been

203
00:13:54,866 --> 00:13:57,619
out there training
except for Henry.

204
00:13:57,702 --> 00:13:58,870
And you, slacker.

205
00:13:58,953 --> 00:14:01,081
I'm just taking
a quick water break!

206
00:14:01,164 --> 00:14:03,500
And what about you, were you
off spying on your sister

207
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:04,918
like you usually do?

208
00:14:05,001 --> 00:14:05,794
What was that?

209
00:14:05,877 --> 00:14:07,212
I mean, uh...

210
00:14:07,295 --> 00:14:09,798
Since you asked, I had to
help train this miscreant.

211
00:14:09,881 --> 00:14:11,091
With that done,

212
00:14:11,174 --> 00:14:14,135
now I'm off to keep watch
over my perfect angel.

213
00:14:14,219 --> 00:14:16,388
[NOELLE] "Keeping watch"
is what you call it?

214
00:14:16,471 --> 00:14:18,223
[FINRAL]
Man, I'm beat.

215
00:14:18,306 --> 00:14:20,684
We could make a great combo
spell with my spatial magic

216
00:14:20,767 --> 00:14:22,227
and his mirror magic.

217
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:25,146
But the timing's been
crazy hard to nail down.

218
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,898
[GAUCHE] I have to cleanse
the filth from my body

219
00:14:26,981 --> 00:14:29,859
before I see my angel.

220
00:14:29,943 --> 00:14:34,114
I can't offend her senses
by showing up drenched in sweat.

221
00:14:34,197 --> 00:14:36,282
[sighs] Sister Theresa
doesn't come back

222
00:14:36,366 --> 00:14:38,076
from her trip till tonight.

223
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:41,079
There was some big meeting for
all the Sisters in the church.

224
00:14:41,162 --> 00:14:42,831
So I guess Gauche wants
to go visit Marie

225
00:14:42,914 --> 00:14:45,583
before she gets home, and
apparently I'm the lucky one

226
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:47,627
who gets to go with him.

227
00:14:47,711 --> 00:14:49,671
[NOELLE] Well, when
the cat's away, right?

228
00:14:51,631 --> 00:14:55,301
[sighs] We'll be together
again soon, Marie.

229
00:14:58,888 --> 00:14:59,973
Hi, Gauche.

230
00:15:00,056 --> 00:15:02,100
Will you need some
help washing your back?

231
00:15:02,183 --> 00:15:05,061
And after that, you can
help me wash my back as well.

How long can he
keep doing that?

235
00:15:13,987 --> 00:15:15,447
He's already been
at it for a while.

236
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:17,532
He must be starting
to get hungry.

237
00:15:19,325 --> 00:15:22,787
I'm not a cook, but I know
I can at least make a sandwich!

There. That must be her.

Her brother is
a former criminal.

[SIONA] And she herself
was possessed by a devil.

246
00:15:45,185 --> 00:15:48,480
She caused grave harm to many
innocent people in the attack.

We need to take care of this

00:18:17,587 --> 00:18:19,631
what the word "seniority" means.

314
00:18:19,714 --> 00:18:22,342
All right, Noelle, I guess
we'll be back in a bit.

315
00:18:22,425 --> 00:18:24,844
A "bit" is not enough.
We'll be a while!

316
00:18:24,928 --> 00:18:26,930
Well, then, guess I'm gonna
be catching it from Yami

317
00:18:27,013 --> 00:18:30,016
in "a while." Here.

318
00:18:32,686 --> 00:18:34,396
Okay, here we go.

319
00:18:34,479 --> 00:18:38,608
8,122! 8,123! 8,124!
8,125! 8,126!

320
00:18:38,692 --> 00:18:40,402
How long do you plan
to be out here?

321
00:18:40,485 --> 00:18:42,362
[ASTA]
Till I get to 10,000! 8,1...

322
00:18:42,445 --> 00:18:46,491
8,200? Wait. No! [screams]

323
00:18:46,574 --> 00:18:47,742
You distracted me
with your question

324
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:49,244
and I totally lost count!

325
00:18:49,327 --> 00:18:50,787
Now I have to start over
from the beginning or

326
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:52,330
I'll cut the workout short!

327
00:18:52,414 --> 00:18:55,959
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8...

328
00:18:56,042 --> 00:18:57,585
[DAZU]
That must be Asta.

329
00:18:57,669 --> 00:19:00,797
[KABWE] Yes. A boy with no mana
and no magical ability.

330
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,842
And yet somehow, he's managed
to become a Magic Knight.

331
00:19:03,925 --> 00:19:06,636
He's nothing but a
filthy devil's servant.

332
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,139
Now, then. Let's do it.

333
00:19:09,222 --> 00:19:10,348
[DAZU]
All according to plan.

334
00:19:10,432 --> 00:19:12,934
[ASTA]
131! 132! 133! 134!

335
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:15,437
--135! 136...?
--[rustling]

336
00:19:18,523 --> 00:19:21,067
[ASTA]
What? Is she alone?

337
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:25,405
Hang on!

338
00:19:30,452 --> 00:19:33,204
[ASTA]
Stay with me! What happened?

339
00:19:34,664 --> 00:19:39,836
[BOW panting]
Please. Take this.

340
00:19:41,379 --> 00:19:44,799
[ASTA, SECREÉ yelp, cough]

341
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:46,968
[ASTA]
What is this?

342
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:48,470
[SECREÉ]
Poison?

343
00:19:53,266 --> 00:19:54,726
[KABWE]
That was impressive!

344
00:19:54,809 --> 00:19:56,853
You're quite a
skilled potion-maker.

345
00:19:56,936 --> 00:19:58,563
[BOW]
Thank you.

346
00:19:58,646 --> 00:20:01,649
[KABWE] I had only counted on
capturing the devil's servant,

347
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:04,944
but it seems we found the
forbidden magic girl as well.

348
00:20:05,028 --> 00:20:07,489
We truly must have
luck on our side today.

349
00:20:07,572 --> 00:20:09,074
[DAZU]
So this is Nero.

350
00:20:09,157 --> 00:20:10,325
[DEMON MASK 142A]
Look at those horns.

351
00:20:10,408 --> 00:20:11,910
She's clearly a devil.

352
00:20:11,993 --> 00:20:13,661
[DEMON MASK 142C]
Indeed, they are proof

353
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:15,246
that she used forbidden magic.

354
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:17,457
[KABWE] Now, then.
Let's get them secured.

355
00:20:20,001 --> 00:20:21,628
Stop this now!

356
00:20:21,711 --> 00:20:23,672
[DEMON MASK 142C]
Let go!

357
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:25,632
[DEMON MASK 142A]
How can he be that strong?

358
00:20:25,715 --> 00:20:26,716
[SECREÉ]
Can't stay conscious.

359
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,803
Nero. Let her go!

360
00:20:29,886 --> 00:20:31,763
Please help me, Asta.

361
00:20:31,846 --> 00:20:34,224
[NOELLE] What do you people
think you're doing?

362
00:20:34,307 --> 00:20:36,935
Get away from Asta
and Nero right now!

363
00:20:37,018 --> 00:20:40,105
Sealing Magic: Inverse Release!

364
00:20:43,358 --> 00:20:48,029
[ASTA]
Can't move my body. Oh, crap.

365
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:49,072
Am I gonna...

366
00:20:49,155 --> 00:20:50,699
[KABWE]
We're out of time, let's go.

00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:07,007
Come back!

374
00:21:09,342 --> 00:21:10,385
What was that?

375
00:21:10,468 --> 00:21:12,595
There's something
happening outside.

376
00:21:16,474 --> 00:21:18,309
Asta! Nero!

377
00:21:19,352 --> 00:21:20,311

Oh, crap!

00:21:33,408 --> 00:21:35,410
[KABWE]
There's no choice. Leave him.

383
00:21:35,493 --> 00:21:36,494
[DAZU]
I agree.

384
00:21:36,578 --> 00:21:39,581

388
00:21:49,257 --> 00:21:51,426

We are the Devil Banishers.
