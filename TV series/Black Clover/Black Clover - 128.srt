00:00:21,928 --> 00:00:23,513
[NARRATOR]
The Clover Kingdom.

2
00:00:23,596 --> 00:00:26,016
In this place where
magic is everything,

3
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:28,977
there lives one boy who
was born without it.

4
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:31,479
His name is Asta.

5
00:00:32,814 --> 00:00:34,232
[NARRATOR]
His strength and determination

6
00:00:34,315 --> 00:00:36,568
helped him become
a Magic Knight.

7
00:00:36,651 --> 00:00:39,237
And despite the many
challenges he faces,

8
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,991
he aims for the top
and refuses to give up!

9
00:00:43,074 --> 00:00:44,701
Rich or poor,

10
00:00:44,784 --> 00:00:46,745
royalty or commoner,

11
00:00:46,828 --> 00:00:49,706
Asta believes anyone can shine.

12
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:52,709
His mission is to prove
that to the whole world

13
00:00:52,792 --> 00:00:55,670
and to become the
next Wizard King!

14
00:02:29,222 --> 00:02:30,890
[ASTA] It's in the heart
of the--the kingdom!

15
00:02:30,974 --> 00:02:34,644
The one with all the hearts!

16
00:02:34,728 --> 00:02:37,188
Stop actin' all squirrelly
and try to make some sense.

17
00:02:37,272 --> 00:02:38,898
Think about what you say.

18
00:02:38,982 --> 00:02:40,734
We got Gordon's dad
to help us look around

19
00:02:40,817 --> 00:02:42,527
for big curses and he
found a stupidly huge one

20
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:45,280
right in the middle of
the Heart Kingdom, okay?

21
00:02:45,363 --> 00:02:46,489
Huh?

22
00:02:46,573 --> 00:02:48,033
[ASTA] I'm pretty sure
it's a devil curse;

23
00:02:48,116 --> 00:02:50,994
I mean, it's gotta be right?
So that's where I wanna go next.

24
00:02:51,077 --> 00:02:53,872
Where's your pal, Gordon?
What does he think about this?

25
00:02:53,955 --> 00:02:56,291
He wanted to learn some
Curse Magic from his dad.

26
00:02:56,374 --> 00:02:59,377
So he decided to stay
home a little longer.

27
00:02:59,461 --> 00:03:01,463
All right. Fine.

28
00:03:01,546 --> 00:03:03,048
Now wanna tell me
why the two of them

29
00:03:03,131 --> 00:03:05,383
look like they've just had
their brains scrambled?

30
00:03:05,467 --> 00:03:07,344
I think it's because
of the food we were given,

31
00:03:07,427 --> 00:03:11,431
but I'm fine. Actually,
I thought it was great.

32
00:03:11,514 --> 00:03:14,184
Fair enough.
Think I'm up to speed.

33
00:03:14,267 --> 00:03:16,686
Cool! So can I go
to the Heart Kingdom?

34
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:19,189
Sure. Just sit tight for now.

35
00:03:19,272 --> 00:03:20,940
I'll look into it.

36
00:03:24,194 --> 00:03:25,528
It's not happenin'.

37
00:03:25,612 --> 00:03:26,821
[BOTH]
Huh?

38
00:03:26,905 --> 00:03:29,574
Apparently the Heart
Kingdom can't be entered.

39
00:03:29,657 --> 00:03:30,825
[BOTH]
Huh?!

40
00:03:30,909 --> 00:03:32,369
[ASTA]
Are you serious, sir?

41
00:03:32,452 --> 00:03:34,120
[NOELLE] I was planning
to go to there, too!

42
00:03:34,204 --> 00:03:37,374
That's where we'll find the next
clue we need, I'm sure of it!

43
00:03:37,457 --> 00:03:38,958
Well, the border's airtight.

44
00:03:39,042 --> 00:03:40,543
The entire length
of it has been rigged

45
00:03:40,627 --> 00:03:42,462
with a bunch of trap spells.

46
00:03:42,545 --> 00:03:44,714
Trip one, and we'll
be wanted criminals.

47
00:03:44,798 --> 00:03:47,050
Might spark an
international incident.

48
00:03:47,133 --> 00:03:48,426
No way!

49
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,512
Wait. Why don't we
just destroy the traps

50
00:03:50,595 --> 00:03:52,847
with my Anti-magic
and sneak in that way?

51
00:03:52,931 --> 00:03:53,973
Because that's dumb.

52
00:03:54,057 --> 00:03:55,892
They'll sense the
traps disappearing.

53
00:03:55,975 --> 00:03:57,060
[ASTA]
Oh.

54
00:03:57,143 --> 00:03:58,645
Well, that's troublesome.

55
00:03:58,728 --> 00:04:02,148
Not even Rouge's power could get
you through there undetected.

56
00:04:02,232 --> 00:04:03,942
[YAMI]
Whatever we try, they'll notice.

[meows]

58
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:06,861
Huh...

59
00:04:06,945 --> 00:04:09,197
Wait. There has to be some way,

60
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,117
because I heard Mimosa say
that she had been there before.

61
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,493
Whoa, really?

62
00:04:13,576 --> 00:04:15,370
[NOELLE] It's true. She said
there was some sort of

63
00:04:15,453 --> 00:04:19,165
student exchange program
between our nobility and theirs.

64
00:04:19,249 --> 00:04:20,375
All right, Finral.

65
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:23,294
Take these twerps to
the Golden Dawn's base.

Uh. Finral? I'm kinda confused.

Why aren't'cha complaining about
gettin' used as an errand boy?

69
00:04:29,884 --> 00:04:31,344
Because I'm excited.

00:04:31,428 --> 00:04:33,680
There's someone I
wanted to see there.

71
00:04:37,058 --> 00:04:38,560
Believe it or not,

72
00:04:38,643 --> 00:04:41,980
it was your brother Finral who
managed to stop you, in the end.

73
00:04:42,063 --> 00:04:44,441
Ugh. Arrogant jerk.

Langris, hey! I heard
you finally woke up!

76
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,613
I'm really glad!

77
00:04:50,697 --> 00:04:51,698
So you came.

00:04:51,781 --> 00:04:53,116
Hello, Finral!

00:04:54,451 --> 00:04:57,078
Lady Finnes. I'm
glad you're well.

80
00:04:57,162 --> 00:04:58,580
Must be satisfying.

Huh?

82
00:04:59,748 --> 00:05:01,708
I tried to murder
my own brother,

83
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:03,460
but found myself defeated.

84
00:05:03,543 --> 00:05:06,379
Then, as my parents
desperately apologized for me,

85
00:05:06,463 --> 00:05:08,882
I tried to murder my king.

86
00:05:08,965 --> 00:05:12,010
I guess I'm the one who's a
disgrace to the family name now.

Wait, what are you saying?!

88
00:05:13,678 --> 00:05:15,764
That was only because you
were possessed by an elf!

it was you who saved me.

Both you and that commoner.
You're insufferable.

You don't have any talent.

And yet, you've still managed
to outdo me somehow.

This isn't over yet. Understand?

[FINNES gasps]

Yeah. That's the spirit!

100
00:05:41,081 --> 00:05:45,377
This just confirms that I'm
right to declare war on you.

101
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:48,755
Starting now, I'll work hard,
prove myself to Father,

102
00:05:48,838 --> 00:05:52,050
and become the kind of man
who deserves to lead our house.

Also, I'll be the man
who makes Lady Finnes happy.

[FINRAL] I'm sorry to drag
you into this, Lady Finnes.

But, I promise,

00:06:01,768 --> 00:06:04,979
once I've become worthy,
I'm gonna come back for you.

[FINRAL] Huh? Should you
be moving right now?

I have to ask you to
wait here, Lady Finnes.

00:08:02,681 --> 00:08:04,099
but I still learned a lot.

160
00:08:04,182 --> 00:08:06,017
Their magic's amazing.

161
00:08:06,101 --> 00:08:07,227
The techniques they use are like

162
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:09,396
nothing you would
find here in Clover.

163
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:10,939
The Heart Kingdom
is a verdant land

164
00:08:11,022 --> 00:08:13,191
through which water
is always flowing.

165
00:08:13,274 --> 00:08:14,693
And its rich
environment generates

166
00:08:14,776 --> 00:08:16,736
a tremendous amount of mana.

167
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,196
If you're right in
saying that what lies

168
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:20,657
at the center of it is
a devil-induced curse,

169
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,450
then we have cause to be scared.

170
00:08:22,534 --> 00:08:25,120
Although it's honestly
hard to believe.

171
00:08:25,203 --> 00:08:26,454
[NOELLE]
A devil's curse.

172
00:08:26,538 --> 00:08:27,747
This could give me a clue

173
00:08:27,831 --> 00:08:30,041
about the devil that
mother encountered.

174
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:31,710
[MIMOSA]
We weren't allowed to meet her,

175
00:08:31,793 --> 00:08:33,294
but I was told that
the queen who rules

176
00:08:33,378 --> 00:08:35,672
over the Heart Kingdom
is every bit as powerful

177
00:08:35,755 --> 00:08:37,924
as one of our
Magic Knight Squads.

178
00:08:38,008 --> 00:08:40,343
They say that she's
an all-knowing mage

179
00:08:40,427 --> 00:08:43,096
who sees everything that
happens in her kingdom.

180
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:45,473
No way! Whoa!

181
00:08:45,557 --> 00:08:47,267
[ASTA]
A queen, huh?

182
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:49,853
If she's like the Witch Queen,
then we might be in trouble.

183
00:08:49,936 --> 00:08:51,938
Well, we're not goin'
over there to pick a fight,

184
00:08:52,022 --> 00:08:54,607
so it's fine. I'll just
keep my guard up.

185
00:08:54,691 --> 00:08:56,401
I believe they're
accepting applications

186
00:08:56,484 --> 00:08:58,111
to visit as we speak.

187
00:08:58,194 --> 00:09:00,405
I'll see if I can get
us all permission to go.

188
00:09:00,488 --> 00:09:02,323
[ASTA]
Thanks a bunch, Mimosa!

189
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,872
It's huge!

190
00:09:08,955 --> 00:09:11,499
I've never seen such an
enormous ship in my life!

191
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:14,502
It's actually on the smaller
side, but it does look nice.

192
00:09:14,586 --> 00:09:17,255
Calm down, Asta,
this isn't a vacation.

193
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:20,133
You never told us that you
owned your own ship, Captain.

194
00:09:20,216 --> 00:09:22,010
Did ya pick it up
recently, or what?

195
00:09:22,093 --> 00:09:24,179
[YAMI]
Well, I met with Julius' helper

196
00:09:24,262 --> 00:09:25,972
and made a few threats.

197
00:09:26,056 --> 00:09:28,641
Or, uh, compelling points,
and he lent it to us.

198
00:09:28,725 --> 00:09:29,851
Huh?

199
00:09:29,934 --> 00:09:31,895
[YAMI] If you damage it,
I'll kill you hard.

200
00:09:31,978 --> 00:09:33,021
Right!

201
00:09:33,104 --> 00:09:35,648
[KLAUS]
Asta. Be careful.

202
00:09:35,732 --> 00:09:37,108
Protect Mimosa.

203
00:09:37,192 --> 00:09:39,194
You have nothing
to worry about, Klaus.

204
00:09:39,277 --> 00:09:41,029
We're making this trip
to investigate something,

205
00:09:41,112 --> 00:09:42,614
not to fight.

206
00:09:42,697 --> 00:09:45,533
But still, if something should
happen while you're out there,

207
00:09:45,617 --> 00:09:47,786
we won't be able
to come to your aid.

208
00:09:47,869 --> 00:09:50,914
I'd feel much better about this
if I could go along, too.

209
00:09:50,997 --> 00:09:53,458
Well, there're only four spots.

210
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:55,251
First up's Asta.

211
00:09:55,335 --> 00:09:58,797
The royal from the Golden Dawn
who arranged all of this.

212
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,175
Noelle, who looks none too
willing to give up her spot.

213
00:10:02,258 --> 00:10:03,718
And then, Finral.

214
00:10:03,802 --> 00:10:05,011
[FINRAL]
Yeah, Captain.

215
00:10:05,095 --> 00:10:07,055
Why'd ya want me to
be the fourth anyway?

216
00:10:07,138 --> 00:10:09,766
'Cause havin' wheels
tends to come in handy.

217
00:10:09,849 --> 00:10:10,600
Agreed?

218
00:10:10,684 --> 00:10:11,893
[BLACK BULLS]
Mm-hm.

219
00:10:11,976 --> 00:10:14,187
Yeah, there's no arguin'
with that logic.

220
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,188
You said it.

221
00:10:15,271 --> 00:10:16,815
He is quite convenient.

222
00:10:16,898 --> 00:10:19,651
I get it. Spatial Magic
is nice to have,

223
00:10:19,734 --> 00:10:21,236
but he's really
just a pack mule.

224
00:10:21,319 --> 00:10:23,738
[FINRAL] Ya know what?
You don't need to understand!

225
00:10:23,822 --> 00:10:24,989
Asta!

226
00:10:25,073 --> 00:10:26,950
Go kick some ass in the
Heart Kingdom for me!

227
00:10:27,033 --> 00:10:27,992
You better not.

228
00:10:28,076 --> 00:10:29,494
Right!

229
00:10:29,577 --> 00:10:31,121
[LUCK] Take care of things
there, and come home soon, okay?

230
00:10:31,204 --> 00:10:33,832
The two of us still need
to have a duel, Asta.

231
00:10:33,915 --> 00:10:34,916
Right!

232
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,418
If you get homesick
and can't sleep,

233
00:10:36,501 --> 00:10:39,295
just take a swig of this stuff
and you'll pass right out.

234
00:10:39,379 --> 00:10:40,130
[ASTA]
Mm-hm!

235
00:10:40,213 --> 00:10:41,715
You're underage, Asta.

236
00:10:41,798 --> 00:10:43,883
Okay, you've all
said your goodbyes.

237
00:10:43,967 --> 00:10:47,846
Now stop wastin' time; you've
got a job of your own to do.

238
00:10:47,929 --> 00:10:49,889
[MAGNA]
Yeah, yeah, we remember.

239
00:10:49,973 --> 00:10:51,599
Let's do this!

240
00:10:51,683 --> 00:10:53,435
[YAMI]
Later.

241
00:10:53,518 --> 00:10:54,894
You scram, too.

242
00:10:54,978 --> 00:10:57,188
Try to stay on your
toes out there.

243
00:10:57,272 --> 00:10:58,523
[ALL]
Right!

244
00:11:09,325 --> 00:11:17,625
[ASTA] ...2,031, 2,032,
2,033, 2,034, 2,035...

245
00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:21,296
[FINRAL]
Stay calm. Just stay calm.

246
00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:23,548
Stay calm.

247
00:11:23,631 --> 00:11:25,675
Out of all the people I
could be traveling with,

248
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:28,845
why did it have to be two
supremely adorable royal babes

249
00:11:28,928 --> 00:11:31,181
and a cool beauty
who turns into a bird?

250
00:11:31,264 --> 00:11:33,224
I don't think I'm gonna
be able to sleep at night.

251
00:11:33,308 --> 00:11:35,143
Oh, come on. Tough it out!

252
00:11:35,226 --> 00:11:36,686
Pull yourself together, man!

253
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:38,813
From now on, you have eyes
for no one but Lady Finnes!

254
00:11:38,897 --> 00:11:40,148
[MIMOSA]
Hey.

255
00:11:41,483 --> 00:11:44,235
Um. I packed us all
some lunch. See?

256
00:11:44,319 --> 00:11:46,780
[ASTA]
Ooh! Thanks, Mimosa!

257
00:11:46,863 --> 00:11:50,075
[MIMOSA] I-It's not much,
but I hope you enjoy it, Asta.

258
00:11:50,158 --> 00:11:53,745
You made all this
yourself? Looks tasty!

259
00:11:53,828 --> 00:11:55,955
So good! Yum.

260
00:11:57,415 --> 00:11:59,167
Thanks for saying so, Asta.

261
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,253
Jeez, slow down.
Save some for us, okay?

262
00:12:02,337 --> 00:12:03,296
[NOELLE grumbles]

263
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,256
Why does this bother me?

264
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,800
Mouth's dry!

265
00:12:06,883 --> 00:12:08,259
Here, have some water.

266
00:12:08,343 --> 00:12:09,844
[ASTA]
That's too much!

267
00:12:09,928 --> 00:12:11,054
[NOELLE]
There. Now thank me.

268
00:12:11,137 --> 00:12:13,348
I'm not grateful. You scared me!

269
00:12:13,431 --> 00:12:14,933
That water almost pushed
me into the ocean!

270
00:12:15,016 --> 00:12:19,020
[MIMOSA] I don't get
why this bothers me.

271
00:12:19,104 --> 00:12:22,148
[FINRAL] What the heck
am I watching right now?

272
00:12:22,232 --> 00:12:24,859
[ASTA] More important
than me drowning?!

273
00:12:29,698 --> 00:12:32,158
[ASTA] Check it out,
we finally made it, you guys!

274
00:12:32,242 --> 00:12:35,036
Who would've thought we could
just enter the kingdom legally?

275
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,539
Once again, Asta:
we aren't here on vacation.

276
00:12:37,622 --> 00:12:39,541
I'm sorry that I wasn't
able to get permission

277
00:12:39,624 --> 00:12:41,459
for anyone else to come.

278
00:12:41,543 --> 00:12:42,836
Nah, don't worry about it!

279
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:44,713
I'm nothin' but grateful
to you for getting us in,

280
00:12:44,796 --> 00:12:46,923
and if we need help, we can
use Finral's spatial magic!

281
00:12:47,007 --> 00:12:49,092
You're gonna get
us all arrested.

282
00:12:51,219 --> 00:12:54,139
Whoa. Why did it get
so foggy all of a sudden?

283
00:12:54,222 --> 00:12:56,516
It's one of the Heart
Kingdom's defense measures.

284
00:12:56,599 --> 00:12:58,143
No vessel can pass
through this fog

285
00:12:58,226 --> 00:13:00,437
unless it's permitted
to by the Queen.

286
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,855
[groans]

287
00:13:01,938 --> 00:13:03,440
[FINRAL] I couldn't
sleep a wink last night

288
00:13:03,523 --> 00:13:06,276
knowing I was surrounded
by beautiful girls. Damn it!

289
00:13:06,359 --> 00:13:08,820
Now I'm wondering what the Queen
of Heart Kingdom looks like.

290
00:13:08,903 --> 00:13:11,239
Is she hot, too? She must be!

291
00:13:11,322 --> 00:13:13,116
[ASTA]
The Heart Kingdom's just ahead.

292
00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:15,160
I can't wait to see it!

293
00:13:18,663 --> 00:13:20,165
[GROUP gasps]

294
00:13:33,303 --> 00:13:34,763
So this is the place.

295
00:13:34,846 --> 00:13:36,014
The Heart Kingdom.

296
00:13:36,097 --> 00:13:38,975
It all blends together.
City, forest, and water.

297
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:41,102
So cool.

298
00:13:43,688 --> 00:13:47,067
Their ship is arriving
right on schedule.

299
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:50,445
The Clover Kingdom's devil
has significant power.

300
00:13:50,528 --> 00:13:53,281
[UNDINE]
Power that we must obtain.

301
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:59,662
Huh. I guess you
could say it's pretty.

302
00:13:59,746 --> 00:14:02,082
Where do ya think we're
supposed to tie up the boat?

303
00:14:02,165 --> 00:14:03,166
[gasps]

304
00:14:05,835 --> 00:14:07,754
[GAJA]
Please continue sailing forward.

Wait, you're--

306
00:14:09,339 --> 00:14:11,341
Allow me to welcome you
to the Heart Kingdom.

307
00:14:11,424 --> 00:14:13,259
I'm the Spirit Guardian Gaja,

308
00:14:13,343 --> 00:14:15,720
and I will act as your guide
while you're here.

309
00:14:15,804 --> 00:14:16,971
Is he important?

310
00:14:17,055 --> 00:14:18,723
He sure seems to be.

311
00:14:18,807 --> 00:14:20,809
[GAJA] It's been quite
a while, Lady Mimosa.

312
00:14:20,892 --> 00:14:23,353
You and I met the
last time you visited.

313

It's lovely to see you, Gaja.

314
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:27,857
I consider it an honor
that you remember me.

315
00:14:27,941 --> 00:14:29,150
How could I forget?

316
00:14:29,234 --> 00:14:30,527
You were well-liked by everyone

317
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,612
who made your
acquaintance, my lady.

318
00:14:32,696 --> 00:14:34,489
Spirit Guardian Gaja,
meet my friends

319
00:14:34,572 --> 00:14:36,241
Asta, Noelle, and Finral.

320
00:14:36,324 --> 00:14:38,201
It's a pleasure to meet you.

321
00:14:40,245 --> 00:14:42,455
Would you care to try
some crimson orange juice?

322
00:14:42,539 --> 00:14:45,500
You can use mana to
sweeten it. For you.

323
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:47,293
[MIMOSA]
Thank you very much.

324
00:14:48,795 --> 00:14:51,131
What is this stuff?
It's fantastic.

325
00:14:51,214 --> 00:14:53,008
Mine tastes super
bitter, Noelle!

326
00:14:53,091 --> 00:14:55,135
Would you run some of your
mana through it for me?

327
00:14:55,218 --> 00:14:57,262
Well, if you're
gonna beg, then fine.

328
00:14:57,345 --> 00:14:59,014
You told us to keep
sailing forward,

329
00:14:59,097 --> 00:15:00,765
but this looks like a dead end.

330
00:15:00,849 --> 00:15:02,142
[GAJA]
Fear not.

331
00:15:09,357 --> 00:15:11,776
[GAJA] The queen will
guide your ship onward.

332
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,278
[GROUP gasps]

333
00:15:13,361 --> 00:15:16,865
[ASTA] Whoa-ho-ho-ho, so it's
the Queen who's moving us?

334
00:15:16,948 --> 00:15:19,492
All of this is being
controlled by one mage?

335
00:15:19,576 --> 00:15:21,911
Both the mist barrier
and the water stairs:

336
00:15:21,995 --> 00:15:23,705
they're products of
the Queen's Mana Zone,

337
00:15:23,788 --> 00:15:26,124
which spans across
the entire kingdom.

338
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,292
That's awesome!

339
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,627
And so's this weird
red juice of yours!

340
00:15:29,711 --> 00:15:32,714
[NOELLE] He can't be serious.
It covers the whole kingdom?

341
00:15:32,797 --> 00:15:34,007
Is that really possible?

342
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:35,216
Whoa!

343
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,802
Even the butterflies
are extra pretty here!

344
00:15:37,886 --> 00:15:40,430
[MIMOSA]
This truly is a lovely kingdom.

345
00:15:40,513 --> 00:15:43,183
It's hard to believe that
there's a devil here.

346
00:15:43,266 --> 00:15:45,935
[GAJA] Our kingdom was
founded 1,200 years ago.

347
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:49,314
Since then, our Queens have
also acted as priestesses,

348
00:15:49,397 --> 00:15:53,651
forming pacts with the spirit
Undine to gain its strength.

349
00:15:53,735 --> 00:15:55,987
This is a country
of water and life.

350
00:15:56,071 --> 00:15:59,157
We steward the land and
it rewards us with mana.

351
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,701
Enough to keep out
any unwanted guests.

352
00:16:01,785 --> 00:16:02,869
Incredible.

353
00:16:02,952 --> 00:16:04,662
To think that one queen
is able to protect

354
00:16:04,746 --> 00:16:07,082
the whole country
through peaceful means.

355
00:16:07,165 --> 00:16:11,169
Yes. That's been
the case so far.

356
00:16:11,252 --> 00:16:14,464
But the future's uncertain.
Even to our queen.

357
00:16:17,842 --> 00:16:19,094
[NOELLE]
Asta!

358
00:16:19,177 --> 00:16:20,303
How could you?

359
00:16:20,387 --> 00:16:22,555
Just what do you think
you're doing, Gaja?

360
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,182
We need his help
to protect the peace

361
00:16:24,265 --> 00:16:25,809
we've cultivated here.

362
00:16:25,892 --> 00:16:27,435
We have to go after him!

363
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:28,895
[grunts] Leave it to me!

364
00:16:28,978 --> 00:16:30,271
[NOELLE]
Don't slow down, Mimosa.

365
00:16:30,355 --> 00:16:32,107
Put your faith in
our transporter!

366
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:33,316
[MIMOSA]
Right!

367
00:16:34,401 --> 00:16:37,487
[FINRAL] Spatial Magic:
Fallen Angel's Wingbeat!

368
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:44,619
Ah. It's only about
a third stage, but still.

369
00:16:48,498 --> 00:16:50,542
You have some rather
intriguing magic.

370
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:51,668
[FINRAL gasps]

371
00:16:51,751 --> 00:16:53,044
Look out!

372
00:16:55,213 --> 00:16:58,091
Water Creation Magic:
Sea Dragon's Lair!

373
00:16:58,174 --> 00:17:02,721
[yelps] How's he floating
without using any spells?

374
00:17:04,264 --> 00:17:06,599
[NOELLE] I don't know what
you're trying to pull.

375
00:17:09,436 --> 00:17:11,062
[NOELLE] But you have
just abducted the friend

376
00:17:11,146 --> 00:17:15,066
of a Clover Kingdom royal, and
that action has consequences!

377
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:16,735
Yeah, Noelle, that's my girl!

378
00:17:16,818 --> 00:17:18,319
A cute face and a cold stare!

379
00:17:18,403 --> 00:17:21,990
What am I saying? Lady Finnes
is the only girl for me!

380
00:17:22,073 --> 00:17:24,534
[GAJA] Her magic is both
rare and powerful.

381
00:17:24,617 --> 00:17:27,120
Definitely first stage.

382
00:17:27,203 --> 00:17:29,831
That's some remarkable
Water Magic you have.

383
00:17:29,914 --> 00:17:32,834
If you aren't holding back,
then I won't either.

384
00:17:34,085 --> 00:17:36,338
[NOELLE]
What kind of spell is this?

385
00:17:41,217 --> 00:17:45,597
[ASTA screams]

386
00:17:47,474 --> 00:17:50,310
[LOROPECHIKA] I'm sorry for
treating you so roughly.

387
00:17:50,393 --> 00:17:54,939
But I must protect my country,
and it has need of your devil.

388
00:17:56,316 --> 00:17:59,778
[ASTA] Where the heck did
that weird bubble take me?

389
00:17:59,861 --> 00:18:02,030
Was that the Heart
Kingdom's Queen talking?

390
00:18:02,113 --> 00:18:03,615
'Cause if so...

391
00:18:05,575 --> 00:18:06,743
Stop!

392
00:18:12,957 --> 00:18:14,584
[NOELLE]
His attribute is lightning?

393
00:18:14,668 --> 00:18:16,920
Then what's the deal with
those runes he makes?

394
00:18:17,003 --> 00:18:18,922
[MIMOSA] It looks like
he's using a type of magic

395
00:18:19,005 --> 00:18:20,799
unique to the Heart Kingdom.

396
00:18:20,882 --> 00:18:24,177
Lightning Magic: Tenjiolia.

397
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,136
[NOELLE]
It's fast.

398
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,555
But my Valkyrie armor is faster!

399
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:29,974
[GAJA]
She truly is a first stage.

400
00:18:30,058 --> 00:18:31,601
But...

401
00:18:31,685 --> 00:18:33,061
My spell has orders.

402
00:18:33,144 --> 00:18:36,064
It will give pursuit until
it strikes its target.

403
00:18:46,116 --> 00:18:46,950
Please, Gaja.

404
00:18:47,033 --> 00:18:49,035
Bring our friend back right now.

405
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:51,746
Refuse, and we'll have
no recourse but to fight.

406
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,206
[GAJA]
An attack spell.

407
00:18:53,289 --> 00:18:56,668
It seems Lady Mimosa has
become a third stage herself.

408
00:18:56,751 --> 00:18:59,879
As for the spatial mage, it
looks like he can make a portal

409
00:18:59,963 --> 00:19:02,298
between any two points
he has sight of.

410
00:19:02,382 --> 00:19:04,509
Allow me to show
you a brief glimpse

411
00:19:04,592 --> 00:19:06,803
of the difference
in our strength.

412
00:19:09,806 --> 00:19:11,850
He cast it into the sky?

413
00:19:16,396 --> 00:19:19,232
[NOELLE gasps]
So much power.

414
00:19:22,277 --> 00:19:24,571
[GAJA] Nature itself
supplies me with mana.

415
00:19:24,654 --> 00:19:26,740
No human can match its might.

416
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:36,875
[ASTA yells]

417
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:39,419
[UNDINE chuckles]

418
00:19:39,502 --> 00:19:41,379
[ASTA]
I can't keep this up forever.

419
00:19:41,463 --> 00:19:44,090
Just how much mana
does this lady have?

420
00:19:44,174 --> 00:19:46,926
Besides, why are we
even fighting, anyway?

421
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:49,012
[UNDINE]
So that's your devil's power.

422
00:19:49,095 --> 00:19:51,056
Magic negation.

423
00:19:51,139 --> 00:19:52,349
[ASTA]
What the--?

424
00:19:57,437 --> 00:20:01,066
Abominable as that is,
it also sounds quite useful.

425
00:20:01,149 --> 00:20:02,650
[ASTA grunts]

426
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:03,693
Pleased to meet you,

427
00:20:03,777 --> 00:20:05,987
Devil-possessed
child from Clover.

428
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:07,822
You may address me as Undine.

429
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:09,616
I'm one of the
Four Great Spirits,

430
00:20:09,699 --> 00:20:12,827
and I'm contracted to the
Queen of the Heart Kingdom.

431
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:14,537
You are quite impressive.

432
00:20:14,621 --> 00:20:17,624
But that doesn't mean
you're any match for me.

433
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:20,210
[UNDINE]
Intriguing.

434
00:20:20,293 --> 00:20:22,796
You don't have any magic
of your own, do you?

435
00:20:22,879 --> 00:20:25,715
Why, that puts you even
beneath the ninth stage.

436
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:28,468
The ninth stage? The heck
are you talking about?

437
00:20:28,551 --> 00:20:30,762
Oh, that's right.
There isn't a system

438
00:20:30,845 --> 00:20:34,933
to quantify magic strength
in your kingdom, is there?

439
00:20:35,016 --> 00:20:37,435
The weakest mages
are of the ninth stage,

440
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:40,438
the eighth are above them,
and the seventh above them.

441
00:20:40,522 --> 00:20:43,441
Our system shows which
mages have the most talent.

442
00:20:43,525 --> 00:20:45,860
[ASTA]
I can't move or breathe!

443
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:48,905
Care to guess which
stage is the highest?

444
00:20:48,988 --> 00:20:50,865
It's stage zero.

445
00:20:57,914 --> 00:21:01,626
True Lighting Magic:
Irial Astrauza!

446
00:21:19,394 --> 00:21:20,687
[GAJA]
If they were still within sight,

447
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:22,772
I'd be able to sense their mana.

448
00:21:22,856 --> 00:21:25,066
They must've fled
with Spatial Magic.

449
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,693
A wise choice.

450
00:21:26,776 --> 00:21:29,279
But no matter where
they try to hide...

451
00:21:30,488 --> 00:21:33,158
[GAJA] He created a portal
to a place he couldn't see?

452
00:21:34,325 --> 00:21:37,412
[MIMOSA] Plant Creation Magic:
Magic Flower Guidepost!

453
00:21:37,495 --> 00:21:40,165
Spatial Magic.
Fallen Angel Gate!

454
00:21:40,248 --> 00:21:41,541
Here's the deal.

455
00:21:41,624 --> 00:21:44,919
We can't just back down after
watching you show off!

456
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:48,423
[NOELLE] Water Creation Magic:
Sea Dragon's Roar!

457
00:21:49,507 --> 00:21:50,633
[groans]

458
00:21:56,556 --> 00:21:57,932
Your system's trash.

459
00:21:58,016 --> 00:22:01,227
You can't measure ability
just by looking at talent.

460
00:22:01,311 --> 00:22:04,689
[SECRÉ]
Sealing Magic: Inverse Release!

461
00:22:04,773 --> 00:22:05,690
[gasps]

462
00:22:05,774 --> 00:22:06,900
[UNDINE]
This magic...

463
00:22:06,983 --> 00:22:08,693
[ASTA] I'll keep my
Anti-magic all around me

464
00:22:08,777 --> 00:22:10,570
so she can't pull me in again.

465
00:22:10,653 --> 00:22:13,073
I can feel a person's ki
just ahead of me.

466
00:22:13,156 --> 00:22:17,702
And if there's a human up there,
then there must be air!

467
00:22:17,786 --> 00:22:18,870
[gasps]

468
00:22:22,165 --> 00:22:24,292
Mind if I join you?

469
