1
00:00:22,262 --> 00:00:23,888
[NARRATOR]
The Clover Kingdom.

2
00:00:23,972 --> 00:00:26,516
In this place where
magic is everything,

3
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:29,436
there lives a magicless
boy named Asta.

4
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,272
This brave young hero devotes
blood, sweat, and tears

5
00:00:32,355 --> 00:00:34,441
to becoming the
next Wizard King.

6
00:00:34,524 --> 00:00:37,861
Though Asta's situation
is practically unheard of,

7
00:00:37,944 --> 00:00:39,863
there are others
residing in this kingdom

8
00:00:39,946 --> 00:00:42,532
who possess at least
a tiny amount of mana

9
00:00:42,615 --> 00:00:45,035
yet can barely
use spells at all.

10
00:00:45,118 --> 00:00:47,746
They make up a very
small minority,

11
00:00:47,829 --> 00:00:50,290
living their lives
in the shadows.

12
00:00:53,752 --> 00:00:56,588
[NARRATOR]
But, like everyone else,

13
00:00:56,671 --> 00:00:59,132
they do their best to survive.

14
00:01:01,217 --> 00:01:03,511
[NARRATOR] The group of
kidnappers led by Dazu Tayak

15
00:01:03,595 --> 00:01:06,514
and Bow Nocde, who had
originally identified themselves

16
00:01:06,598 --> 00:01:08,975
as the Devil Banishers,
were later revealed

17
00:01:09,059 --> 00:01:10,852
to be called the
Devil Believers:

18
00:01:10,935 --> 00:01:12,937
those who worship the devil.

19
00:01:13,021 --> 00:01:15,523
After their true intentions
were made known,

20
00:01:15,607 --> 00:01:17,817
the Devil Believers murdered
Kabwe and the other

21
00:01:17,901 --> 00:01:20,653
Magic Parliament members
whom they had manipulated.

22
00:01:20,737 --> 00:01:23,615
Then left with Nero
and Asta's grimoire.

23
00:01:23,698 --> 00:01:26,618
So what, you think they might
wanna offer it Nero as a gift?

24
00:01:26,701 --> 00:01:28,119
Huh. That reminds me,

25
00:01:28,203 --> 00:01:30,914
they still have the
kid's grimoire, too.

26
00:01:30,997 --> 00:01:32,207
[JULIUS]
Once they pay tribute,

27
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:33,958
they'll defect to
the Spade Kingdom.

28
00:01:34,042 --> 00:01:36,461
Or rather, the devil inside it.

29
00:01:36,544 --> 00:01:38,963
Right. Good luck.

30
00:01:39,047 --> 00:01:40,840
[NARRATOR]
Asta and the other Black Bulls

31
00:01:40,924 --> 00:01:43,968
set out after the
Devil Believers.

32
00:01:44,052 --> 00:01:45,804
[MAGNA] It's gonna be pretty
difficult to catch up to them

33
00:01:45,887 --> 00:01:49,307
if they managed to make it past
Breed Mountain in this weather.

34
00:01:49,391 --> 00:01:53,687
[gasps] Look down there.
I think I see them!

35
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:56,064
[NARRATOR] They finally
managed to catch up.

36
00:01:56,147 --> 00:01:57,148
However...

37
00:01:57,232 --> 00:02:00,026
How are there so many?
This is insane.

38
00:03:55,975 --> 00:03:57,519
[BOW]
How lovely.

39
00:03:59,229 --> 00:04:00,772
The sunset.

40
00:04:00,855 --> 00:04:02,649
[DAZU]
Oh, yes, of course.

41
00:04:02,732 --> 00:04:04,984
I honestly hadn't noticed it.

42
00:04:05,068 --> 00:04:07,904
[BOW] It only takes a few brief
moments for the sun to go down,

43
00:04:07,987 --> 00:04:09,531
but it always shines
so brilliantly

44
00:04:09,614 --> 00:04:11,408
until the very last second.

45
00:04:11,491 --> 00:04:14,411
It's such a peaceful thing
to watch, don't you think?

46
00:04:14,494 --> 00:04:15,662
Yes.

47
00:04:15,745 --> 00:04:18,248
Sorry, is your name Bow Nocde?

48
00:04:18,331 --> 00:04:21,835
You live in the forest on
the outskirts of town, right?

49
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,253
[BOW]
You've heard of me?

50
00:04:23,336 --> 00:04:26,172
[DAZU] Yes, my mother-in-law's
mentioned you before.

51
00:04:26,256 --> 00:04:28,008
Let me guess.
She told you to avoid

52
00:04:28,091 --> 00:04:31,052
that strange woman who makes
those questionable medicines.

53
00:04:31,136 --> 00:04:34,180
Oh, no! Nothing like that!

54
00:04:34,264 --> 00:04:36,683
Is that what those are for?

55
00:04:36,766 --> 00:04:37,767
[BOW]
Yes.

56
00:04:37,851 --> 00:04:39,936
[DAZU]
Wow. You're incredible.

57
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,438
How so?

58
00:04:41,521 --> 00:04:42,897
[DAZU] Well, most people
in this kingdom

59
00:04:42,981 --> 00:04:44,899
use magic for everything.

60
00:04:44,983 --> 00:04:47,694
But you actually
make things yourself.

61
00:04:47,777 --> 00:04:50,321
Where did you learn how
to create medicines like that?

62
00:04:50,405 --> 00:04:51,448
[BOW]
Nowhere, really.

63
00:04:51,531 --> 00:04:52,907
What?

64
00:04:52,991 --> 00:04:55,702
I learned all that I could
about different herbs,

65
00:04:55,785 --> 00:04:58,788
then I kept trying
until something worked.

66
00:04:58,872 --> 00:05:00,081
[DAZU]
All alone?

67
00:05:00,165 --> 00:05:02,584
[BOW] I barely have
any magic ability.

68
00:05:02,667 --> 00:05:06,838
So, I figured out the one thing
I could do and stuck with it.

69
00:05:06,921 --> 00:05:08,840
I should be going.

70
00:05:08,923 --> 00:05:09,841
[DAZU]
Uh, wait!

71
00:05:09,924 --> 00:05:13,011
My name is Dazu! Dazu Tayak.

72
00:05:13,094 --> 00:05:14,596
I hope this isn't
too presumptuous,

73
00:05:14,679 --> 00:05:19,017
but could I visit you sometime?

74
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,978
Of course. It'd be nice
to see you again.

75
00:05:22,062 --> 00:05:23,813
I'll even make a batch
of medicine for you,

76
00:05:23,897 --> 00:05:25,565
if you'd like to learn.

77
00:05:52,884 --> 00:05:54,094
[DAZU]
This is great.

78
00:05:54,177 --> 00:05:56,346
The bombs you make
are so effective.

79
00:05:56,429 --> 00:05:58,723
[BOW] Looks like we're clear
to keep moving forward.

80
00:05:58,807 --> 00:06:01,810
We should hurry,
before it gets too dark.

81
00:06:01,893 --> 00:06:03,353
We need to pass
through Breed Mountain

82
00:06:03,436 --> 00:06:06,564
and cross the border
as quickly as we can.

83
00:06:06,648 --> 00:06:07,941
[DEMON MASK 142A]
Once we do, we'll be out

84
00:06:08,024 --> 00:06:10,193
of the Clover
Kingdom's jurisdiction.

85
00:06:10,276 --> 00:06:12,278
That way, even if the
Magic Knights find us,

86
00:06:12,362 --> 00:06:14,489
they can't do anything.

87
00:06:14,572 --> 00:06:16,616
[DEMON MASK 144AA]
We'll be in Spade before long.

88
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,159
[SECREÉ]
No, you won't.

89
00:06:18,243 --> 00:06:19,869
Even if you get out
of the Clover Kingdom

90
00:06:19,953 --> 00:06:21,746
without being caught,
you'll still have to go through

91
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:24,457
a strong magic
region on the way.

92
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:26,751
[NARRATOR] The Spade Kingdom
is a mysterious land

93
00:06:26,835 --> 00:06:28,920
covered in snow and secrets.

94
00:06:29,004 --> 00:06:30,630
Between there and
the Clover Kingdom

95
00:06:30,714 --> 00:06:33,299
lies a neutral zone
belonging to no nation.

96
00:06:33,383 --> 00:06:37,095
Most of this area is classified
as a strong magic region.

97
00:06:37,178 --> 00:06:39,556
The term "strong magic
region" refers to a place

98
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:42,058
that possesses a powerful
force field of mana,

99
00:06:42,142 --> 00:06:44,310
which causes various
magical phenomena

100
00:06:44,394 --> 00:06:46,646
that keep outsiders at bay.

101
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:49,065
This and other harsh conditions

102
00:06:49,149 --> 00:06:51,484
make these places
quite treacherous.

103
00:06:51,568 --> 00:06:53,987
[SECREÉ] Getting through a strong
magic region's a difficult task

104
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:57,073
even for a Magic Knight,
so how do you expect to do it

105
00:06:57,157 --> 00:06:59,909
with almost no magic
ability to speak of?

106
00:06:59,993 --> 00:07:00,910
[DAZU]
Well...

107
00:07:00,994 --> 00:07:02,871
[BOW]
You bring up a good point.

108
00:07:02,954 --> 00:07:04,873
Do you plan to die?

109
00:07:04,956 --> 00:07:08,877
[DAZU] Die? I suppose
that's a possibility.

110
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,422
But, it's enough to know
that we have a chance.

111
00:07:14,966 --> 00:07:16,051
[DAZU]
Let's go.

112
00:07:16,134 --> 00:07:17,218
[BOW]
Right.

113
00:07:19,554 --> 00:07:21,431
Hey, Captain Yami,
this is Magna.

114
00:07:21,514 --> 00:07:23,641
Let me know if you can hear me!

115
00:07:23,725 --> 00:07:25,185
We tracked down
the Devil Believers,

116
00:07:25,268 --> 00:07:27,395
but they got us pretty
outnumbered here!

117
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:29,647
So we're waitin'
for your orders, boss!

118
00:07:29,731 --> 00:07:31,691
Are you there? Come in!

119
00:07:31,775 --> 00:07:34,778
The mana in this area
seems a little messy.

120
00:07:34,861 --> 00:07:35,904
And we're close to the border

121
00:07:35,987 --> 00:07:37,655
where that strong
magic region is,

122
00:07:37,739 --> 00:07:40,909
so that might be why
the signal's bad.

123
00:07:40,992 --> 00:07:42,243
All right, you two.

124
00:07:42,327 --> 00:07:43,995
I'm gonna look for a spot
with better reception

125
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:46,498
so I can talk to Captain Yami.

126
00:07:46,581 --> 00:07:48,583
Stay here so I know
where to find you.

127
00:07:48,667 --> 00:07:50,293
I'll come back soon
with reinforcements,

128
00:07:50,377 --> 00:07:52,170
and then we'll be ready to roll!

129
00:07:53,421 --> 00:07:57,384
Let's kick it into
high gear, Crazy Cyclone!

130
00:07:57,467 --> 00:07:59,302
Hey! Magna! Wait up!

131
00:07:59,386 --> 00:08:01,638
If we have to stay out here in
this rain for too much longer,

132
00:08:01,721 --> 00:08:03,473
then we're going
to catch cold for sure!

133
00:08:03,556 --> 00:08:06,976
Though, they say idiots can't
catch cold, so Asta's safe.

134
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:13,441
[ASTA yells]

135
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,071
What's the matter with you?

136
00:08:18,154 --> 00:08:19,572
The second he tells us
to stay put,

137
00:08:19,656 --> 00:08:22,117
you go barreling
up the mountain?

138
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,785
[ASTA]
I'm worried about Nero!

139
00:08:23,868 --> 00:08:25,745
Believe me, I wanna
rescue Nero, too,

140
00:08:25,829 --> 00:08:27,580
but we need some kind of plan!

141
00:08:27,664 --> 00:08:29,791
Could we make them
scatter somehow?

142
00:08:29,874 --> 00:08:31,126
[ASTA]
No, that won't work!

143
00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:33,712
Then what are you thinking?

144
00:08:33,795 --> 00:08:35,505
I'll talk to them some more.

145
00:08:35,588 --> 00:08:38,091
Maybe we'll understand
each other better!

146
00:08:38,174 --> 00:08:39,300
If it were that simple,

147
00:08:39,384 --> 00:08:41,845
then we wouldn't be
in this mess right now!

148
00:08:43,596 --> 00:08:46,599
Nero...

149
00:08:46,683 --> 00:08:49,561
Good grief. You are so stubborn!

150
00:08:49,644 --> 00:08:51,146
Come on.

151
00:08:51,229 --> 00:08:55,233
I'll help you get up there.
You'd better say thank you.

152
00:08:55,316 --> 00:08:56,943
Thank you so much, Noelle!

153
00:08:57,027 --> 00:08:59,988
Sure, it's fine, but,
uh, you owe me one.

154
00:09:14,502 --> 00:09:15,337
[MAN 147B grunts]

155
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,838
[MAN 147A]
Whoa, you okay?

156
00:09:16,921 --> 00:09:18,798
[MAN 147B]
Yeah. I'll be all right.

157

Here, take my hand.

00:09:20,592 --> 00:09:21,343
[MAN 147B]
Thanks.

159
00:09:21,426 --> 00:09:23,094
I can't stop shaking.

160
00:09:23,178 --> 00:09:26,598
It's even colder now that
the sun's going down, isn't it?

161
00:09:26,681 --> 00:09:29,017
Yes, but we have to press on.

162
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,019
[WOMAN 147B] Thinking back on
everything I've been through,

163
00:09:31,102 --> 00:09:32,729
this is nothing at all!

164
00:09:34,773 --> 00:09:38,276
[DAZU] After everything I've
been through, this is nothing.

165
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,028
[BOW]
You're exactly right.

166
00:09:48,745 --> 00:09:50,705
[BOW]
Beautiful.

167
00:09:50,789 --> 00:09:52,665
[DAZU]
Just like back then.

168
00:10:04,135 --> 00:10:05,345
[DAZU]
A full moon.

169
00:10:05,428 --> 00:10:06,763
[BOW]
Perhaps the mana will be weaker

170
00:10:06,846 --> 00:10:09,974
in the strong magic region.

171
00:10:10,058 --> 00:10:15,271
[DAZU] The odds may be against
us, but there's still a chance.

172
00:10:15,355 --> 00:10:17,941
Thanks to chance,
I was able to meet you,

173
00:10:18,024 --> 00:10:20,026
and to make it this far.

174
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,903
You've helped me get
through so many trials

175
00:10:21,986 --> 00:10:26,741
and hardships, Bow.
I'm eternally grateful.

176
00:10:26,825 --> 00:10:28,493
[BOW]
So am I.

177
00:10:28,576 --> 00:10:30,328
We've come such a long way,

178
00:10:30,412 --> 00:10:33,748
but we still have a very
difficult road ahead of us.

179
00:10:33,832 --> 00:10:35,959
[DAZU] Then let's
keep working together.

180
00:10:36,042 --> 00:10:37,419
[BOW]
You and me.

181
00:10:40,338 --> 00:10:41,256
[FOLLOWER 147A]
What's that?

182
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:42,424
[FOLLOWER 147B]
Could it be...?

183
00:10:42,507 --> 00:10:44,300
--[FOLLOWER 147AA] Look!
--[DAZU, BOW gasp]

184
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,013
[DAZU]
Asta!

185
00:10:52,517 --> 00:10:55,520
[DEVIL BELIEVERS gasp]

186
00:10:57,564 --> 00:10:58,815
Asta!

187
00:10:59,983 --> 00:11:02,402
We finally tracked you down!

188
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,915
[ASTA]
Nero, where are you?

189
00:11:18,376 --> 00:11:21,338
Hey, wait.
Something isn't right.

190
00:11:21,421 --> 00:11:23,840
I'm sure you're
too dumb to notice it,

191
00:11:23,923 --> 00:11:27,218
but I'm not detecting much mana
from these people at all.

192
00:11:27,302 --> 00:11:28,678
Huh?

193
00:11:28,762 --> 00:11:31,264
[NOELLE] Just like the boy
we saw back in the village.

194
00:11:31,348 --> 00:11:34,309
He only had that faint,
fleeting mana.

195
00:11:35,602 --> 00:11:37,812
[NOELLE] Is it really that
common for people in our Kingdom

196
00:11:37,896 --> 00:11:40,315
to have such weak magic power?

197
00:11:40,398 --> 00:11:44,277
If this is just some of them,
how many more are there?

198
00:11:44,361 --> 00:11:45,987
[ASTA]
Found her.

199
00:11:46,071 --> 00:11:48,365
Nero! We're here to save you!

200
00:11:48,448 --> 00:11:49,741
Hey, be more careful!

201
00:11:49,824 --> 00:11:52,243
It's fine. The wind's
real strong, so if they

202
00:11:52,327 --> 00:11:54,079
try to hit us with a
sleep potion or something,

203
00:11:54,162 --> 00:11:55,747
it'll blow away!

204
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:57,999
It's still pretty risky, though.

205
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:05,715
[NOELLE]
We're Magic Knights.

206
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:10,178
We're supposed to protect
these people, not fight them!

207
00:12:10,261 --> 00:12:14,516
But Asta's my squadmate.
I have to protect him, too.

208
00:12:17,644 --> 00:12:19,187
[ASTA]
Now what?

209
00:12:23,483 --> 00:12:25,652
Master Asta, you're really here!

210
00:12:25,735 --> 00:12:29,114
That's him, the one who's been
blessed with the devil's power!

211
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:37,163
[NOELLE] They're praising Asta
because they worship the devil!

212
00:12:47,716 --> 00:12:50,593
[ASTA] You're Dazu Tayak,
the leader, right?

213
00:12:50,677 --> 00:12:51,553
[DAZU]
Asta.

214
00:12:51,636 --> 00:12:54,014
[ASTA]
And you're Bow Nocde.

215
00:12:54,097 --> 00:12:56,057
You can't have Nero!

216
00:12:56,141 --> 00:12:59,310
She's really important to us,
and we have to bring her home.

217
00:13:01,146 --> 00:13:02,564
Asta.

218
00:13:04,524 --> 00:13:06,860
I know what you're doing:
you think that if you give Nero

219
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,695
and my grimoire to
the Spade Kingdom,

220
00:13:08,778 --> 00:13:12,574
they'll say you can join
forces with them.

221
00:13:12,657 --> 00:13:13,533
Good plan.

222
00:13:13,616 --> 00:13:15,827
Too bad you don't have me.

223
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:19,414
[DAZU] If you know all that,
then one thing should be clear.

224
00:13:19,497 --> 00:13:22,125
[BOW] There's no way we
can give your friend back.

225
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:23,668
[ASTA]
After you cross these mountains,

226
00:13:23,752 --> 00:13:25,879
you'll be on neutral ground.

227
00:13:25,962 --> 00:13:28,590
The strong magic region up
ahead won't be as bad tonight

228
00:13:28,673 --> 00:13:30,717
since there's a full
moon, so I'm guessing

229
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,510
you're gonna try
to push through.

230
00:13:32,594 --> 00:13:33,511
But with so many people,

231
00:13:33,595 --> 00:13:35,889
there's no way
you'll all make it.

232
00:13:35,972 --> 00:13:37,515
[DAZU]
We're well aware.

233
00:13:37,599 --> 00:13:41,644
Even so, I--we must press on.

234
00:13:43,104 --> 00:13:47,442
[DAZU] I barely have any mana,
so I can only use small spells.

235
00:13:47,525 --> 00:13:50,236
As you know, magic is everything
in the Clover Kingdom,

236
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,322
so I was regarded as worthless.

237
00:13:52,405 --> 00:13:54,699
I might as well
have never been born.

238
00:13:54,783 --> 00:13:57,243
Even my own parents
looked down on me.

239
00:13:57,327 --> 00:13:58,620
I was bullied.

240
00:13:58,703 --> 00:14:01,456
My teachers mocked me
and I couldn't make friends.

241
00:14:01,539 --> 00:14:03,625
Everyone gave me dirty looks.

242
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:06,378
I'm sure you understand, Asta.

243
00:14:10,965 --> 00:14:13,176
Yeah.

244
00:14:13,259 --> 00:14:16,304
[DAZU] That's why I worked
so much harder than my peers,

245
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:19,140
but no matter what I did,
my lack of magic ability

246
00:14:19,224 --> 00:14:21,976
always made me the target
of disgust and ridicule.

247
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,312
[ASTA]
But, you weren't alone!

248
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:26,856
Your husband
accepted you, right?

249
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,358
[DAZU]
Accepted me?

250
00:14:28,441 --> 00:14:30,777
When that old lady Maggie
from Tiulyu talked about you,

251
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,862
she said your mother-in-law
was happy that her son

252
00:14:32,946 --> 00:14:35,156
had married such
a wonderful girl!

253
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,450
I know things were hard,
but at least you had a family

254
00:14:37,534 --> 00:14:39,035
who loved you the way you were!

255
00:14:39,119 --> 00:14:40,578
So even if you didn't
have much power,

256
00:14:40,662 --> 00:14:43,498
you were still happy
about that, weren't you?

257
00:14:43,581 --> 00:14:47,293
[DAZU] I wasn't happy at all!
I knew how they really felt.

258
00:14:47,377 --> 00:14:52,382
Maybe, if they had lived...
No, people are all the same.

259
00:14:54,092 --> 00:14:58,847
[DAZU] Every day I spent
with them was a nightmare.

260
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:01,808
They always smiled at me,
told me my cooking

261
00:15:01,891 --> 00:15:04,436
was delicious, and
complimented my hard work.

262
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:06,021
That's good!

263
00:15:06,104 --> 00:15:08,064
[DAZU] I'm sure our neighbors
saw my husband and his mother

264
00:15:08,148 --> 00:15:10,191
as kind, charitable people.

265
00:15:10,275 --> 00:15:14,446
But behind closed doors,
they still mocked me.

266
00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:18,575
They looked down on me,
just like everyone else!

267
00:15:18,658 --> 00:15:20,785
Those two didn't
accept me at all.

268
00:15:20,869 --> 00:15:24,289
They were only using me!

269
00:15:24,372 --> 00:15:26,791
They enjoyed treating
me like trash!

270
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,752
It was the one thing that
made them feel better

271
00:15:28,835 --> 00:15:31,671
about their own pathetic lives!

272
00:15:31,755 --> 00:15:33,465
I'm happy they're dead!

273
00:15:33,548 --> 00:15:36,217
They deserved what
happened to them!

274
00:15:37,427 --> 00:15:38,928
[BOW]
Dazu.

275
00:15:39,012 --> 00:15:41,097
[DAZU]
I'm sorry, I just...

276
00:15:41,181 --> 00:15:43,141
[BOW] The details of
the situation may vary

277
00:15:43,224 --> 00:15:45,435
from person to person,
but everyone in our group

278
00:15:45,518 --> 00:15:48,313
has had a similar experience.

279
00:15:48,396 --> 00:15:50,648
You all feel like that?

280
00:15:50,732 --> 00:15:51,983
[BOW]
Yes.

281
00:15:52,067 --> 00:15:53,902
I'm able to create medicines
and potions that are

282
00:15:53,985 --> 00:15:56,029
far more effective than
the magic of an average

283
00:15:56,112 --> 00:15:59,532
recovery mage, so my
skills are quite valuable.

284
00:15:59,616 --> 00:16:02,952
Despite that, I was still
shunned for my lack of mana.

285
00:16:03,036 --> 00:16:06,164
Occasionally, people would
rely on my expertise,

286
00:16:06,247 --> 00:16:08,124
but once my usefulness
had run its course,

287
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,835
they wanted nothing
more to do with me.

288
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:12,504
[DEMON MASK 142A] That's what
happened to me, too!

289
00:16:12,587 --> 00:16:14,881
I spent countless nights
pouring over my books

290
00:16:14,964 --> 00:16:17,092
while my peers were
out having fun!

291
00:16:17,175 --> 00:16:20,428
[DEMON MASK 144AA]
I always had to work so hard!

292
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:22,639
[FOLLOWER 147A]
So did I!

293
00:16:22,722 --> 00:16:23,973
[FOLLOWER 147B]
Me, too!

294
00:16:26,059 --> 00:16:28,353
[FOLLOWER 147C]
We all did!

295
00:16:28,436 --> 00:16:29,562
[FOLLOWER 147D]
Everyone made fun of us

296
00:16:29,646 --> 00:16:31,398
because we couldn't use magic!

297
00:16:31,481 --> 00:16:34,192
[FOLLOWER 147BB] Sometimes it
felt like we didn't even exist!

298
00:16:34,275 --> 00:16:36,111
[FOLLOWER 147E]
But that's over now!

299
00:16:36,194 --> 00:16:38,780
[FOLLOWER 147F]
We're leaving this awful place!

300
00:16:38,863 --> 00:16:40,740
[BOW]
Look at these poor souls.

301
00:16:40,824 --> 00:16:42,492
We met them on our way
to the Spade Kingdom

302
00:16:42,575 --> 00:16:46,121
and realized they had suffered
the same terrible things.

303
00:16:46,204 --> 00:16:47,914
But they lived in the shadows,

304
00:16:47,997 --> 00:16:50,208
so we never would have
known about them.

305
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:53,169
I had no idea this many
residents of the Clover Kingdom

306
00:16:53,253 --> 00:16:55,338
were dealing with
such discontent.

307
00:16:55,422 --> 00:16:57,716
[DAZU] To think that all these
people understood our pain

308
00:16:57,799 --> 00:17:00,176
and wanted to help us.

309
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,053
And you!

310
00:17:02,137 --> 00:17:04,389
How dare you tell us
to go back now?

311
00:17:04,472 --> 00:17:07,851
You would have us return
to that miserable existence?

We've had enough!

313
00:17:10,145 --> 00:17:12,480
[DEMON MASK 144AA] You of all
people should understand!

Trust me. I get it.

315

Asta.

316
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:17,569
I know how much it sucks!

00:17:17,652 --> 00:17:20,196
That's exactly why
I have to stop you!

318
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,823
What is it about
the Spade Kingdom

319
00:17:21,906 --> 00:17:25,493
that makes you so desperate
to fight alongside them?

320
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:28,329
[DAZU] We want to gain
the devil's power.

321
00:17:28,413 --> 00:17:29,247
You're kidding!

322

[SECREÉ gasps]

323
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:32,667
[DAZU] Kabwe from the
Magic Parliament told us

324
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:34,919
there was a devil
in the Spade Kingdom.

325
00:17:35,003 --> 00:17:36,463
We thought, if we went there,

326
00:17:36,546 --> 00:17:40,133
the strength of that great
being might be shared with us.

327
00:17:42,093 --> 00:17:45,764
[DAZU] I crave power.
All of our people do.

328
00:17:45,847 --> 00:17:48,141
[BOW] After aligning with the
Spade Kingdom and receiving

329
00:17:48,224 --> 00:17:50,602
the devil's
overwhelming might...

330
00:17:50,685 --> 00:17:52,520
[DAZU]
...we'll return to Clover...

331
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:54,064
[DAZU, BOW]
...and seek revenge.

332
00:17:54,147 --> 00:17:56,941
Come on. Don't do this!

333
00:17:57,025 --> 00:17:59,277
[DAZU] "The three leaves of
a clover are said to contain

integrity, hope, and love.

335
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:05,200
The fourth leaf is
given over to good luck,

336
00:18:05,283 --> 00:18:07,911
and in the fifth leaf
dwells a devil."

337

Isn't that how the saying goes?

338
00:18:09,496 --> 00:18:11,581
That's right.

339
00:18:11,664 --> 00:18:14,584
[DAZU] Even though you had no
mana and couldn't use magic,

340
00:18:14,668 --> 00:18:16,336
you still gained
the devil's blessing

341
00:18:16,419 --> 00:18:19,089
because you had this grimoire.

342
00:18:19,172 --> 00:18:20,382
[BOW]
You joined the Magic Knights

343
00:18:20,465 --> 00:18:22,300
and accomplished great things.

344
00:18:22,384 --> 00:18:24,678
You have no idea
how much we admire you.

345
00:18:24,761 --> 00:18:27,972
Don't admire me! Not for that!

346
00:18:28,056 --> 00:18:30,475
[DAZU]
We want to become like you.

347
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:32,394
[BOW]
That's why we're going to Spade.

348
00:18:32,477 --> 00:18:34,104
[DEMON MASK 142A]
Once we have the devil's power,

349
00:18:34,187 --> 00:18:35,605
we can be reborn!

350
00:18:35,689 --> 00:18:38,566
[DEMON MASK 144AA] And then our
suffering will be avenged!

351
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:41,611
[DAZU]
That is our only objective.

352
00:18:41,695 --> 00:18:43,154
[ASTA]
But I'm different!

353
00:18:43,238 --> 00:18:44,322
[DAZU]
Different?

354
00:18:44,406 --> 00:18:45,824
[ASTA]
That's right!

355
00:18:45,907 --> 00:18:48,118
I trained my butt off to make up
for not having any magic,

356
00:18:48,201 --> 00:18:50,036
and people still
treated me like crap!

357
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,913
I've spent my whole life
being made fun of, too!

358
00:18:51,996 --> 00:18:54,666
But I never hated
anybody for it!

359
00:18:54,749 --> 00:18:57,127
It's true, I was able to
use the devil's Anti-magic

360
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:59,295
because I had that grimoire,
but I never once

361
00:18:59,379 --> 00:19:00,672
thought about using
it to get revenge

362
00:19:00,755 --> 00:19:02,257
on the Clover Kingdom,
or to punish

363
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,509
any of the people
who treated me badly!

364
00:19:04,592 --> 00:19:06,720
I only used it to help!

365
00:19:06,803 --> 00:19:08,471
Whether they're rich or poor,

366
00:19:08,555 --> 00:19:10,098
royalty or commoner,

367
00:19:10,181 --> 00:19:13,727
I just want everybody
to be happy!

368
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:16,062
[DAZU] I can only imagine
how happy we could've been

369
00:19:16,146 --> 00:19:18,648
if we looked at the
world the way you do.

370
00:19:18,732 --> 00:19:20,525
[BOW]
Indeed.

371
00:19:20,608 --> 00:19:24,446
[DAZU] However, the flames of
our hatred cannot be quenched.

372
00:19:24,529 --> 00:19:26,489
Which is why we won't
be releasing your friend!

373
00:19:26,573 --> 00:19:29,659
[BOW] We'll continue our
journey toward Spade.

374
00:19:29,743 --> 00:19:30,869
Sure, whatever.

375
00:19:30,952 --> 00:19:32,787
But Nero's stayin' right here.

376
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:34,372
[DAZU]
Did you not hear me?

377
00:19:34,456 --> 00:19:36,958
[ASTA]
Then let me go instead!

378
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:38,209
Oh, no.

379
00:19:38,293 --> 00:19:40,086
[ASTA] Wouldn't it be
better to have me, too,

380
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:41,588
not just my grimoire?

381
00:19:41,671 --> 00:19:43,882
You went after both of us
the first time you showed up,

382
00:19:43,965 --> 00:19:47,677
so obviously I was
part of your plan.

383
00:19:47,761 --> 00:19:49,721
[DAZU] Fine, but we'll
have to restrain you.

384
00:19:49,804 --> 00:19:50,638
Of course.

385
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:51,473
[DAZU]
And her, too.

386
00:19:51,556 --> 00:19:52,640
What?

387
00:20:01,691 --> 00:20:04,235
[ASTA] Now let Nero go,
like you promised.

388
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:06,279
[DAZU]
We'll be glad to do that.

389
00:20:06,363 --> 00:20:09,657
[BOW] After we safely deliver
you to the Spade Kingdom.

390
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:11,284
You just made a mistake.

391
00:20:11,368 --> 00:20:14,913
Nah, don't worry.
I have faith in them.

392
00:20:14,996 --> 00:20:18,249
[DAZU] We'll do whatever it
takes to win the devil's favor.

393
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:21,419
And the more gifts we can offer,
the better our chances.

394
00:20:21,503 --> 00:20:26,091
[BOW] Asta and his grimoire, the
girl who used forbidden magic,

395
00:20:26,174 --> 00:20:28,093
and a royal, as well!

396
00:20:28,176 --> 00:20:29,803
[DAZU] I think they'll
be pleased with this.

397
00:20:29,886 --> 00:20:33,264
That's if we get through
the strong magic region.

398
00:20:33,348 --> 00:20:37,435
[DAZU] Yes, of course.
Now, let's proceed.

399
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:47,904
[NOELLE]
We're at the border.

400
00:20:47,987 --> 00:20:50,448
[DAZU, BOW panting]

401
00:20:50,532 --> 00:20:51,991
[DAZU]
Almost there.

402
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:55,328
[BOW]
Get ready.

403
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:00,625
[NOELLE]
I can feel it.

404
00:21:00,709 --> 00:21:04,337
Full moon or not, the mana's
so strong, it's overwhelming.

405
00:21:04,421 --> 00:21:06,756
How do you plan to do this?

406
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,425
[DAZU] As you know,
our magic capability

407
00:21:08,508 --> 00:21:11,928
is basically nonexistent.

408
00:21:12,012 --> 00:21:13,263
[BOW]
But not entirely.

409
00:21:13,346 --> 00:21:17,559
We do possess
a small amount of mana.

410
00:21:17,642 --> 00:21:21,104
[DAZU] Using my Catalyst Magic,
I can gather the scraps of mana

411
00:21:21,187 --> 00:21:24,774
we each possess and combine
them into something great.

412
00:21:24,858 --> 00:21:26,860
Just as even the
tiniest drops of water

413
00:21:26,943 --> 00:21:29,529
can become an
unstoppable current.

414
00:21:29,612 --> 00:21:31,281
[BOW]
Dazu's Catalyst Magic will draw

415
00:21:31,364 --> 00:21:32,907
all of our strength together.

416
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:34,284
And then we can use that power

417
00:21:34,367 --> 00:21:36,453
to survive the
strong magic region!

418
00:21:36,536 --> 00:21:37,954
That's crazy!

419
00:21:38,038 --> 00:21:40,248
[DAZU]
Maybe. But it's our best shot.

420
00:21:40,331 --> 00:21:42,375
There's too much
distance to cover,

421
00:21:42,459 --> 00:21:44,627
and no way to be sure that
your mana will hold out

422
00:21:44,711 --> 00:21:47,756
until we get there.
This won't work.

423
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:49,924
[DAZU]
I understand it's a gamble,

424
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:52,844
but at least one of us might
make it, and perhaps that person

425
00:21:52,927 --> 00:21:54,929
will obtain the devil's power.

426
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:56,139
There's no turning back;

427
00:21:56,222 --> 00:21:58,350
we must see this plan
through to the end.

428
00:21:58,433 --> 00:22:01,519
