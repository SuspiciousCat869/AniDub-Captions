Threatened by a ruthless demon,

00:00:25,682 --> 00:00:28,560
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

00:00:32,105 --> 00:00:34,441
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

stepped forward and
took up the fight.

00:00:43,533 --> 00:00:45,535
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

00:00:45,618 --> 00:00:49,497
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

Well. 'Bout that time.

11
00:01:03,636 --> 00:01:06,306
Let's go pay the rest
of our friends a visit,

12
00:01:06,389 --> 00:01:09,893
and then, we'll wipe
out all humankind!

as well to head off
the invasion.

16
00:01:27,035 --> 00:01:30,080
But during their trip, they
realized that their hometown

17
00:01:30,163 --> 00:01:32,207
of Hage Village
was under attack,

18
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:35,460

desperately to rid the priest

of Poison Plant Magic,
but even with the help

of the Demon-Slayer Sword,
the spell's effects

27
00:01:59,651 --> 00:02:01,611
appeared impossible to reverse.

You're not done yet!
Ya hear me?!

Don't die. You can't die!

30
00:02:06,908 --> 00:02:08,827
You were supposed to
stick around for a while

to watch over us.
To see me through!

That sword... It's his!

I saw it back at the
Midnight Sun's hideout!

It must've slipped into

It's the same one that

Why does he have it?

I can't go against the flow.

you're actually like?

320
00:17:11,312 --> 00:17:13,023
Why would you say that?

321
00:17:13,106 --> 00:17:16,109
Of course this is what
I'm actually like!

322
00:17:16,192 --> 00:17:18,403
How did I get myself
into this mess?

323
00:17:18,486 --> 00:17:19,904
Oh, I should probably mention,

324
00:17:19,988 --> 00:17:22,115
I'm a member of
the Purple Orcas.

325
00:17:22,198 --> 00:17:24,617
As some already know,
our former captain

326
00:17:24,701 --> 00:17:29,122
was involved in bribery and
other kinds of corruption.

327
00:17:29,205 --> 00:17:31,291
So, I was patrolling
the Forsaken Realm

328
00:17:31,374 --> 00:17:34,669
looking for ways to rebuild
our squad's reputation.

329
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:37,672
Wow! Endangered
Horseface Berries.

330
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:39,549
I don't believe it!

331
00:17:39,632 --> 00:17:41,259
And this carnivorous species

332
00:17:41,343 --> 00:17:43,511
can't be found in
any encyclopedia!

333
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:44,763
Who knew the Forsaken Realm

334
00:17:44,846 --> 00:17:46,598
was such a treasure
trove of rare plants

335
00:17:46,681 --> 00:17:48,641
that you don't see
in the capital!

336
00:17:48,725 --> 00:17:50,226
[DIGIT] As I wandered
through the forest,

337
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:52,145
I ended up getting lost.

338
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,231
[screams]

339
00:17:55,315 --> 00:17:56,691
[DIGIT]
The next thing I knew,

340
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:58,568
I wasn't myself anymore.

341
00:17:58,651 --> 00:18:01,321
And then I started
attacking the village!

342
00:18:04,157 --> 00:18:06,284
I still don't know
what's going on.

343
00:18:06,368 --> 00:18:08,703
I mean, everything
happened so quickly!

344
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:10,622
Stop panicking.

345
00:18:10,705 --> 00:18:13,625
Although, there's
one thing I do know!

346
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:16,127
That elf spirit who
took over my body:

347
00:18:16,211 --> 00:18:18,838
whoever it was,
he didn't want this!

348
00:18:18,922 --> 00:18:22,509
He didn't approve of all
this hatred and violence.

349
00:18:22,592 --> 00:18:24,761
It wasn't his choice.

350
00:18:26,346 --> 00:18:29,057
Come on, Yuno.
We'll save everyone.

351
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,850
The elves and the humans!

352
00:18:30,934 --> 00:18:31,726
Yeah.

353
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,478
Wait, you're leaving already?

354
00:18:33,561 --> 00:18:35,271
But you just got back home!

355
00:18:35,355 --> 00:18:36,773
[HORO]
Please stay with us!

356
00:18:36,856 --> 00:18:39,442
[ARLU] Yeah, we wanna
hear more stories!

357
00:18:39,526 --> 00:18:41,986
Now, now. Try not to be selfish.

358
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:45,448
We'll miss these two, but the
kingdom needs protection.

359
00:18:45,532 --> 00:18:47,075
There are other
people in danger,

360
00:18:47,158 --> 00:18:48,952
just like we were tonight.

361
00:18:49,035 --> 00:18:51,287
Okay.

362
00:18:51,371 --> 00:18:53,540
[ARLU] Will you write
to us again soon?

363
00:18:53,623 --> 00:18:54,374
Of course.

364
00:18:54,457 --> 00:18:55,709
It's a promise!

365
00:18:55,792 --> 00:18:58,169
You better work on your
handwriting though, Asta!

366
00:18:58,253 --> 00:19:00,964
It's way too hard to read!

367
00:19:01,047 --> 00:19:04,009
And you have to swear
that you won't get killed,

368
00:19:04,092 --> 00:19:05,343
no matter what!

369
00:19:05,427 --> 00:19:09,097
Right! Bye, Gramps!
Sorry it was so short!

370
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,306
Gramps?

371
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:12,350
Where did that little
nickname come from?

372
00:19:12,434 --> 00:19:13,893
[ASTA]
I dunno, I just like it!

373
00:19:13,977 --> 00:19:16,271
[HIGH PRIEST]
Well, I don't, so stop it!

374
00:19:16,354 --> 00:19:18,440
[DIGIT] I'm sorry, but
would it be all right

375
00:19:18,523 --> 00:19:20,191
if I came along with you?

376
00:19:20,275 --> 00:19:22,902
Despite my demeanor,
I am a Magic Knight.

377
00:19:22,986 --> 00:19:24,154
Yeah, come on!

378
00:19:24,237 --> 00:19:25,780
Let's get going.

379
00:19:27,115 --> 00:19:29,701
See ya later!

380
00:19:29,784 --> 00:19:32,996
We're gonna go save
the Clover Kingdom!

381
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:34,748
--[ARLU] G'bye!
--[NASH] Asta!

382
00:19:34,831 --> 00:19:36,249
Take care!

383
00:19:36,332 --> 00:19:38,543
Thank you for all
the letters and the money,

384
00:19:38,626 --> 00:19:41,504
but nothing's better
than you coming home safe!

385
00:19:41,588 --> 00:19:43,506
Be careful out there!

386
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:46,259
Sister! I love you so much!

387
00:19:46,343 --> 00:19:47,802
[BOTH]
Shut up.

388
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:51,514
You're off to save
the kingdom, eh?

389
00:19:51,598 --> 00:19:53,683
Our little Asta,
who's never been able

390
00:19:53,767 --> 00:19:56,728
to use magic at all. And Yuno.

391
00:19:56,811 --> 00:19:59,064
He's the hope of
Hage Village now.

392
00:19:59,147 --> 00:20:01,107
Even though he always
used to be so timid

393
00:20:01,191 --> 00:20:04,444
and burst into tears so easily.

394
00:20:04,527 --> 00:20:07,614
You both grew up so quickly,
it's unbelievable!

395
00:20:07,697 --> 00:20:10,283
Take care of
yourselves, you hear?

396
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:19,209
Huh? What's up with that
giant rock in the sky?

397
00:20:22,587 --> 00:20:24,506
Oh boy, I think
it's finally time

398
00:20:24,589 --> 00:20:27,467
for me to have
some fun for real!

399
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:29,719
[ASTA] After all that,
we're super behind!

400
00:20:29,803 --> 00:20:31,096
We should hurry!

401
00:20:31,179 --> 00:20:35,308
[gasps] I sense
elven magic up ahead.

402
00:20:35,392 --> 00:20:37,769
It's coming from the
north and the south.

403
00:20:39,562 --> 00:20:42,565
[DIGIT] I-It's just a guess,
but maybe even more

404
00:20:42,649 --> 00:20:45,735
Magic Knights got possessed
and started attacking humans.

405
00:20:45,819 --> 00:20:47,362
What should we do?
Aren't we supposed

406
00:20:47,445 --> 00:20:49,322
to go to the capital now?

407
00:20:49,406 --> 00:20:50,573
Even if they live out here,

408
00:20:50,657 --> 00:20:53,076
they're still citizens
of the Clover Kingdom!

409
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:54,494
That's that, then.

410
00:20:54,577 --> 00:20:56,329
Since there are
two places in danger,

411
00:20:56,413 --> 00:20:57,956
perhaps we should split up?

412
00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:00,834
Good idea, that way
we can protect everybody.

413
00:21:00,917 --> 00:21:02,043
You go with Yuno!

414
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:04,671
No, I'll be fine on
my own. Go with Asta.

415
00:21:04,754 --> 00:21:06,506
Duh, Yuno is a whole
lot more capable

416
00:21:06,589 --> 00:21:07,966
than you are, sword boy!

417
00:21:08,049 --> 00:21:09,300
I don't need any backup,

418
00:21:09,384 --> 00:21:10,719
so why don't you just
take him with you?

419
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:12,429
--No thanks.
--[ASTA] Come on!

420
00:21:12,512 --> 00:21:13,972
[DIGIT]
Um, this is awkward.

421
00:21:14,055 --> 00:21:16,933
Please don't fight
over me, okay?

422
00:21:17,017 --> 00:21:18,935
Look, I've got this,
which means I can turn

423
00:21:19,019 --> 00:21:21,146
our friends back to
their regular selves!

424
00:21:21,229 --> 00:21:23,231
And you don't have that
ability, so it'll be better

425
00:21:23,314 --> 00:21:25,442
if you bring somebody
with you to help out!

426
00:21:25,525 --> 00:21:27,819
[YUNO sighs]
Surprisingly, you're right.

427
00:21:27,902 --> 00:21:29,362
[ASTA]
Why's it surprising?

428
00:21:29,446 --> 00:21:33,033
[YUNO] I guess he can use his
poison to incapacitate them.

429
00:21:33,116 --> 00:21:34,784
I'm starting to
feel like you guys

430
00:21:34,868 --> 00:21:37,454
don't want me here.

431
00:21:37,537 --> 00:21:38,455
[ASTA]
Ready?

432
00:21:38,538 --> 00:21:40,290
[YUNO]
Of course.

433
00:21:40,373 --> 00:21:42,292

See you at the capital!

[YUNO, ASTA]
"Splitting Up."

436
00:23:22,058 --> 00:23:24,185
Asta. Just so we're
clear, are you certain

437
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:26,354
you wanna split up
and go off on your own?

438
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:28,982
Of course I do, don't treat
me like some kinda baby!

439
00:23:29,065 --> 00:23:30,400
You're completely sure?

440
00:23:30,483 --> 00:23:31,609
Uh-huh!

441
00:23:31,693 --> 00:23:33,278
I'll ask you one more time.

442
00:23:33,361 --> 00:23:34,904
You definitely want to split up?

443
00:23:34,988 --> 00:23:37,782
I told you, yes! What?

444
00:23:37,866 --> 00:23:40,035
You gonna get all
lonely and cry if I do?

445
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:41,661
Don't be stupid.

446
00:23:41,745 --> 00:23:43,747
Then, let's go ahead
and split up already.

447
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,165
I'll meet ya at the capital!

448
00:23:45,248 --> 00:23:46,624
Sounds good.

449
00:23:47,709 --> 00:23:48,752
Well, bye then.

450
00:23:48,835 --> 00:23:49,627
So awful.

451
00:23:49,711 --> 00:23:52,672

I'm scared.

454
00:23:58,178 --> 00:24:00,555
so I rushed over! What's
the matter with you, Luck?

Whoa! Why are you hittin' me?
