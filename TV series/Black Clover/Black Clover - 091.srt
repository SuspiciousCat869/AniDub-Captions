[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:18,458
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:24,375
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:26,916
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,625
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:39,916
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,375
[NARRATOR] When the Black
Bulls' hideout was attacked

8
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:45,458
by the Eye of the Midnight Sun,

9
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:47,708
Gauche, Gordon,
and Grey were aided

10
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:49,625
by an unfamiliar ally.

[HENRY] I won't let anyone
get away with hurting them.

Henry and his powerful magic,

15
00:01:01,416 --> 00:01:03,666
these four Black Bulls
managed to drive away

16
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,000
Rades and his group
of miscreants. But...

17
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:09,041
How could we let this happen?

18
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:10,833
Whatever they stole
from our hideout,

19

they're long gone with it now!

20

Here it is.

00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:16,041
[LICHT]
Well done.

22
00:01:17,916 --> 00:01:19,958
[NARRATOR] The enemy had
run off with a magic stone

23
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:24,416
from inside the base.
Throughout all this...

24
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,583
Mereoleona's Royal Knights
were infiltrating

Sun's fortress.

And Rhya the Disloyal,

the last of the Third Eye,
was on the move.

28

[RHYA] Apparently, we have a
real tricky bunch on our hands.

Seeing as Licht isn't around.

30

This is gonna be a pain.

He makes it look easy,

almost like he's up against
a bunch of novices.

I've never seen Sir Nozel
looking this determined before!

He's amazing.

47

[NOZEL] According to the
information I've gathered,

48
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:17,541
that Spatial Mage has
a habit of venturing

49
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:20,458
out of the fortress at
the same time every day.

50

That time is now.

51
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,708
We currently have our
own Spatial Mage outside

casting a Spatial Jamming spell.

53
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,291
That should prevent any other
mages from entering the base.

54
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:35,000
[NOZEL] Get ready, Licht.
I'm coming after you.

But I've cast all that aside,
along with my luscious hair.

This noble sacrifice
has allowed my already

00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,500
Seems like you would
be amusing to fight.

161
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:35,833
He's with the Third Eye,

162
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:38,750
the Eye of the Midnight
Sun's strongest fighters!

163
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:39,875
Oh?

164
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:41,916
Rhya the Disloyal.

165
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,666
He can copy other
people's magic abilities!

166
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,625
Now that you mention it,
I do know who he is.

167
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,041
[ASTA]
You forgot him?!

168
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:51,916
[ZORA] Hold on a second.
He's got a lot of power.

169
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,625
We're goin' toe-to-toe with him?

170
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:57,958
It's too bad that
you're royalty.

171
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:01,208
I was hoping you and I could
go out for a drink sometime.

172
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:04,000
Heh. I'll tell you what.

173
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,375
Why don't I send you to Hell,

174
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:08,541
and you can have a drink there?

175
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:11,625
Ooh, you really are scary.

176
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:13,041
No, thanks, though.

177
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:16,875
I've already tasted Hell,
and I didn't care for it.

178
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:21,291
Copy Magic: Dark
Cloaked Black Blade.

179
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:23,208
Hey, that's Captain
Yami's spell!

180
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:25,500
You can't rip him off like that!

181
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,458
I hate to break it to ya,

182
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:30,708
but copying people's
kinda my thing.

183
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:32,666
If he's that easy to mimic,

184
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,250
Yami's got a long way to go.

185
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:36,791
[RHYA]
Shall we start?

186
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,333
Just so ya know,
you won't be able

187
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:40,750
to dodge this one so easily!

188
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,291
Check out the stance.

189
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,125
That's the captain's, too!

190
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:48,208
Copy Magic: Dark Cloaked
Lightless Slash!

191
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:55,500
[gasps]

192
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:57,625
She burned up the
spell with a punch?

193
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,208
He's in trouble.

194
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:02,583
Nice impression, but
Yami's had more power.

195
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:03,625
Work on it.

196
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:05,875
Oh, yeah? Then--

197
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,666
[groans]

198
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,541
[MEREOLEONA] I'll show you
what destruction looks like!

199
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:15,250
Flame Magic: Calidos Brachium!

200
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:20,000
[RHYA grunts]

201
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:25,208
I'll burn this place down in
honor of my foolish brother!

202
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:47,166
[MEREOLEONA] I'll show you
what destruction looks like!

203
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:51,875

[RHYA grunts]

205
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:03,958
[ZORA]
She's moving so fast. Plus,

206
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:07,625
those fiery fists are chock-
full of condensed magic.

207
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:10,958
It's a simple spell,
but it's effective.

208
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:14,416
She's a greater warrior than
any mage I've ever seen.

209
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,541
Awesome!

210
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:17,083
She's not fighting
him from a distance;

211
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:19,375
she's gettin' right in his face!

212
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:20,833
[gasps]

213
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:23,208
[ASTA] That gives me an idea!
I bet I can learn a lot

214
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:25,750
from how she handles
herself in close combat!

215
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:28,458
[yelps]

216
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:34,416
Copy Magic: Healing
Light Particles.

217
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,250
Argh! He healed up again!

218
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,250
[MEREOLEONA]
Hm.

219
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,416
Fine. I'm joining the fi--

220
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,333
[grunts, yelps]

221
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:49,625
Unless you wanna die,
just stand back and watch.

222
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:51,875
Aw!

223
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:53,208
[RHYA]
I see.

224
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:57,041
So this time, you're the
biggest thorn in my side.

225
00:12:57,125 --> 00:13:00,416
However, I wouldn't
get too cocky

226
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:04,125
since you stole that
power from us, Royal.

227
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:08,791
Copy Magic: Light
Swords of Conviction!

228
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:13,416
[RHYA] She can't possibly
keep up at this speed.

229
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:21,500
[MEREOLEONA growls]

230
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:27,791
What's next?

231
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,583
[ASTA whimpering]

232
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:30,750
That was amazing,

233
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:33,166
I don't even care that
it set me on fire!

234
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:37,458
[RHYA] Her movements--
they're practically superhuman.

235
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:45,625
[RHYA]
Copy Magic: Invisible Seeker.

236
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,958
Jeez, talk about unoriginal.

237
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:49,625
Whose spell did he just use?

238
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:51,333
I know that one.

239
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:54,291
I think it was the former
captain of the Purple Orcas!

240
00:13:57,458 --> 00:14:00,541
Copy Magic: Aqua Javelin!

241
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:08,500
[RHYA] She can change
direction in midair?

242
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:10,666
Try again!

243
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,958
[RHYA] She reacts almost
as quickly as Vetto!

244
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:16,750
[MEREOLEONA]
You can't escape!

245
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:28,291
Copy Magic: Tainted
Culvert Wyrm!

246
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:32,625
This is the most powerful
Water Magic we have!

247
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:34,458
How do you like it?

248
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,375
[roars]

[RHYA]
Copy Magic: Salamander's Breath!

251
00:14:58,541 --> 00:14:59,958
Your move!

252
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:05,541
[RHYA] Water is her weakness
and Fire is her affinity,

253
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:07,750
but she can burn
through both of them?

254
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:09,916
You're getting on my nerves!

255
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,125
[MEREOLEONA]
Come on. Is that all you've got?

256
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:14,250
[RHYA grunts]

257

[RHYA grunts]

[MEREOLEONA]
Next!

263
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,625
[RHYA]
Copy Magic: Sticky Salamander!

264
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,416
[MEREOLEONA]
Next!

265
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:44,125
[RHYA]
Copy Magic: Jotunn's Ice Floe!

266
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:58,625
Calidos Brachium!

267
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:05,791
Next!

268
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:10,625
She's relentless.

269
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,750
Meroleona Vermillion.

270
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:15,708
She's as ferocious
as the rumors say.

271
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:17,541
I've done a little
research on her.

272
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,166
This beast of a woman spends

273
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,625
300 days a year living
in the woods and plains.

274
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,541
She says it's
because the capital

275
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:28,166
is too stifling and that
she prefers wild game.

276
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,500
Yum!

277
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:30,666
[ZORA] Because of all the
time she spent basking

278
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,875
in the mana of
the natural world,

279
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:37,166
word has it, she's taken
Mana Skin to the next level.

280
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,583
And judging by those
animalistic movements.

281
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,916
I'd be inclined to believe it.

282
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,333
This is the first I've
seen of this Rhya guy

283
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:46,625
and his Copy Magic,
but I feel like

284
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:49,458
I've got a good idea
of how it works.

285
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:52,166
It allows him to mimic
a spell from its attribute,

286
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,625
and that means that
he has every single

287
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:56,000
attribute at his fingertips.

288
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:59,708
Which is only possible because
of his astounding power.

289
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:03,125
[ZORA] Because of that,
any spell copied

290
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:07,291
from an average mage would be
more potent than the original.

291
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:09,500
But there's one
thing he can't do,

292
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:12,208
and that's cast a second attack
from a different attribute

293
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:14,833
while he's already
got one working.

294
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:16,500
We saw that when
he tried it before

295
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:18,708
and lost his transparency.

296
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:20,375
Most mages wouldn't
stand a chance

297
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:23,375
against a cheating
scumbag like him.

298
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:25,333
But, this is her.

299
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:27,708
[MEREOLEONA growls, yells]

300
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:31,958
[ASTA] Whoa! She keeps
gettin' cooler and cooler!

301
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:34,375
Isn't there any technique
I can steal from this fight

302
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:36,708
and use later? Anything?

303
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:40,041
[growls] You're such a pain!

304
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,250
Let's see how you counter this!

305
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:46,041
--What?
--[ZORA] No.

306
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:47,541
That's my sword!

307
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:49,333
[ZORA]
How did he do that?

308
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:52,541
I didn't know he could
copy antimagic, too!

309
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:55,083
[RHYA] All I need to do
to steal someone's magic

310
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:56,666
is touch their grimoire.

311
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,083
And when I was transformed,

312
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:00,750
I managed to make
contact with it.

313
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,791
Not bad, eh, Licht?

314
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,833
[yawns]

315
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:12,166
Copy Magic, huh? Great.

316
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,500
Well, I guess this is
kinda fitting for somebody

317
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:17,125
who's as empty as I am, right?

318
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:20,291
Actually, Rhya, you're
the kindest person I know.

319
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:22,791
Huh? What makes you say that?

320
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:24,958
Heh. You see people
for who they are,

321
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:27,208
and you can always
find the good in them.

322
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:30,000
I suppose that's why
you have that magic.

323
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:32,166
It's because I like people?

324
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,083
You can't use it
without first observing

325
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:35,625
and understanding someone.

326
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:37,333
It means you're kind.

327
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:41,125
[RHYA] You thought I was kind,
but you were wrong.

328
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:45,625
Not only am I disloyal,
I'm a lazy, worthless liar.

329
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:48,458
But Licht said so many
wonderful things about me.

330
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:50,625
He was truly the kind one.

331
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:53,708
And when you people deceived
him and killed him,

332
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:56,250
an unfathomable amount
of anger and hate

333
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:58,750
welled up inside of me!

334
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:01,666
Your time has come,
you foul humans!

335
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,458
I'm going to slaughter
every one of you!

336
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:05,625
[yells]

337
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:08,708
[yells]

338
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:13,708
So it was just for show.

339
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:16,666
You can't copy
anti-magic after all.

340
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,250
[RHYA]
She thought it might be real

341
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:21,166
and she still punched me
without hesitation?

342
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,625
If I could use anti-magic,

343
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:24,875
it would have destroyed
that fist of hers!

344
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:26,958
And such intense mana...

345
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,916
This woman's incredible!

346
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,208
It's not just because
she's a royal.

347
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:35,541
This is a human strength
we've never known!

348
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:37,583
[MEREOLEONA]
Are you done playin' around?

349
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:38,375
[RHYA gasps]

350
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:39,791
Now then...

351
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:42,041
[RHYA] She's gone beyond
Mana Skin to control

352
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:44,666
all the mana in the area!

353
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,791
It's time to end this!

354
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:56,458
[MEREOLEONA] Mana Zone.
Calidos Brachium Barrage!

355
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:01,791
[MEREOLEONA yells]

356
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,666
[MEREOLEONA]
What's wrong, Mr. Third Eye?

357
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,416
Running out of spells?

358
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,000
Yeah, he's finished.

359
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:18,375
[RHYA] No time to use Fast
Movement or Recovery Magic.

360
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:20,041
What can I do now?

361
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:23,750
I had no idea she'd mastered
a Mana Zone attack!

362
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,375
[NARRATOR]
With the Mana Zone ability,

363
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,375
the user is able to
manipulate the mana

364
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:30,833
in the surrounding area to
suit his or her own purposes.

365
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:32,916
This means that any
mana-using techniques

366
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,208
activated within that zone
can be controlled, as well.

367
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:40,000
Try another attack! I dare you!

368
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:42,333
[NARRATOR] Additionally,
Mana Zone gives a massive boost

369
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:44,166
to sensitivity and
reaction speed.

370
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,000
Borrowing power
from nearby mana,

371
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:48,125
one can move freely
through the air.

372
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:51,333
[ZORA] She's too good,
it's gettin' ridiculous.

373
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,916
[ASTA] We struggled so hard
to beat the Third Eye,

374
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,666
and now look!

375
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:59,041
Captain Mereoleona,
you're so strong!

376
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:01,333
If that's really your best,

377
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:04,375
I'll punch you until
you're a pile of ashes!

378
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:07,125
Now, burn!

379
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,250
[RHYA]
Well, I guess that's it for me.

380
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:20,625
Wind Magic: Tornado
Fang, times three.

381
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,416
Huh?

382
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,791
[MIDNIGHT SUN MAGES groan]

383
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:27,291
Sorry, but you can't defeat me.

384
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:29,000
You don't have what it takes.

385
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:31,291
Nice one, Yuno!

386
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:33,875
[MIMOSA] His magic came
from behind them.

387
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:36,875
Could that be the ability
they call Mana Zone?

388
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:41,458
[MIMOSA]
Now that I think about it,

389
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:44,583
he cast a spell inside
another spell earlier.

390
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:45,833
And Spirit Dive...

391
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:48,083
He used Mana Zone to do it!

392
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:51,458
Yuno really is an
outstanding Magic Knight!

393
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:58,208
Do you hear that?

394
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:01,625
[gasps] I heard it before, too!

395
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:03,166
[YUNO]
A heartbeat?

396
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:08,541
The mana here feels so familiar.

397
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:48,625
[RHYA]
The Royal Knights, huh?

398
00:23:48,708 --> 00:23:51,458
Eh, I might as well play
with them a little longer.

399
00:23:51,541 --> 00:23:54,708
<i>Black Clover</i> , Page 92:
"The Wizard King vs.

400
00:23:54,791 --> 00:23:57,333
the Leader of the Eye
of the Midnight Sun."

401
00:23:57,416 --> 00:24:00,750
Go on, Licht. Crush that
Wizard King for good.
