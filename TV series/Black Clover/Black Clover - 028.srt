[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,708
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:24,458
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:27,416
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:35,708
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:39,625
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

[NARRATOR]
Finral Roulacase, member of the

8
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:23,333
Black Bulls Magic Knight squad,
had some concerns.

9
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:25,708
Some very serious concerns.

10
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:29,208
[FINRAL]
What now? What should I do?

11
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:32,708
[NARRATOR] Was it a mission
that had him so preoccupied?

12
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:34,666
[FINRAL]
The mixer tonight!

13
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,083
[NARRATOR]
No. He was planning a mixer,

14
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:38,916
a party meant to
help men and women

15
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,041
forge closer friendships.

16
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:43,208
[FINRAL] Let's see, how
do I wanna arrange this?

17
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:45,375
I have three ladies
lined up already.

18
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:48,500
Mm. A line of ladies.

19
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:50,291
No! Focus, Finral.

20
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:53,375
You have to decide which
squadmates to bring with you.

21
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:58,416
Asta's a firecracker, so he's
a must. But I need one more.

Oh, yeah! Nice one!

27
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:37,166
[FINRAL] Maybe. Girls do like
the whole bad boy thing.

28
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:42,125
Hey, ladies. You wanna
see a real man's ride?

29
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,166
Check out my Crazy Cyclone here.

30
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:47,958
Just hop on and I'll treat you
to the full Magna experience.

Almost there.

Soon I'll have a life-size

39
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,708
in all her glory!

40
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:11,291
Oh, Marie. I can feel
you here beside me.

41
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:13,500
My beloved little sister.
My precious...

No. I can just see it now.

00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:22,000
Take a look at my Marie.

44
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:24,833
Have you ever seen
anybody more angelic?

45
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:28,375
No. Because there is no one
who can compare to her.

Ew. So gross.

with you if you want.

It's not like
I'm not into girls...

Excuse me! Can I get some more?

Very sorry.

Okay, no Charmy, then.
So, what about Vanessa?

Except, he is a little
rough around the edges.

So, wearing our robes is okay?

Magic Knights and all,

00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:03,458
and of a higher social standing
than I am, what's the point?

160
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:05,541
[HELENE]
Just forget it.

161
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:06,625
[FINRAL]
Uh-oh.

162
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:10,083
I'm not getting an
"interested" vibe.

163
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:13,000
Okay! Well, that does it for us.

164
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:15,083
Now, let's hear all about you!

165
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:16,791
We're dying to
learn more, ladies.

166
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:19,833
You ready? Let's go!

167
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:21,875
Well. I don't know
what to say, really.

168
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:23,041
We're all friends.

169
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,875
I'm Erika, and I work
for a dressmaker.

170
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,625
I'm Helene, and I work
at a barbershop.

171
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:29,458
Rebecca, I work at a restaurant.

172
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:32,458
[FINRAL]
Nope, not interested at all.

173
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:35,583
Wow! You all work, that's great.

174
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:38,541
I'd love to hear a little bit
more about what you do.

175
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,250
Maybe you could
make me an outfit.

176
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:42,041
What do you think
would look good on me?

177
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:43,416
Would you give me a haircut?

178
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,125
I think it's time for me
to try out a new look.

179
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:48,750
Can I drop in for a bite?

180
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:50,291
[FINRAL]
Well, that didn't work.

181
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:53,291
What's a topic that
might reel them in?

182
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:54,541
So.

183
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,541
Wanna hear about what
we do as Magic Knights?

184
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:58,458
Yes, that would be wonderful.

185
00:10:58,541 --> 00:10:59,833
Please, tell us everything.

186
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:00,708
[FINRAL]
Bingo!

187
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:02,666
I'm happy to oblige.

188
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:06,166
I get to see a lot of different
places as a Spatial Magic user.

189
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,791
I could tell you about
some of my recent travels.

190
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,291
Please do!

191
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:12,541
[FINRAL]
Ah-- Well...

192
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:14,666
Hey, I need to get
to the john quick.

193
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,750
Right.

194
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,541
Finral, it's bath time.

195
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,166
Right.

196
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,791
So, uh, I'm ready for bed.

197
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:24,541
Right.

198
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:27,666
[FINRAL] Lately, all I've been
doing is dealing with Yami.

199
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,041
Luck! You've been working hard.

200
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:31,291
Tell us about it.

201
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:32,291
Who, me?

202
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,375
Well, go on now, don't be shy.

203
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:36,833
The ladies said they
wanted to hear everything.

204
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:39,166
My work, huh? Let me think.

205
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:42,083
Oh! I was fighting these
bad guys, you know?

206
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:43,000
Bandits.

207
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:43,958
[HELENE, ERIKA]
Mm-hm! Mm-hm!

208
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:46,000
And, oh, boy. Wow.

209
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:47,500
Talk about a bloodbath!

210
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,041
I coulda just killed
'em if I wanted,

211
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,750
but I decided to be
nice and let 'em go

212
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:53,666
with a few bones
still left intact.

213
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,375
[FINRAL]
You're not helping, Luck!

214
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:56,583
Then another time,

215
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:57,875
I was fighting this
really strong mage...

216
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:59,666
Yeah, thanks, Luck!

217
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,708
Now, aren't you getting hungry?

218
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:05,166
Well, I'd like to
hear from Asta.

219
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:08,833
He helped protect the royal
capital, didn't you, Asta?

220
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,833
Oh, yeah. That's right.

221
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,166
Wait!

222
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,958
Are you talking about
the attack the other day?

223
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,583
That sounded so scary.

224
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:17,416
[FINRAL]
Our Asta wasn't scared, though.

225
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,083
He even got a promotion.

226
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:20,916
[BOTH]
Wow!

227
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,250
[FINRAL]
All right, got 'em!

228
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:25,208
Now we just need to keep
the conversation on track.

229
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:26,708
That's amazing!

230
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:27,833
[ASTA]
The people we were fighting

231
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:29,666
were really tough, though.

232
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,750
Managed to put three
new holes in me,

233
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,666
and man did it hurt!

234
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,791
Wow, it's all squishy, too.

235
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:41,208
[ASTA] Ow! Jeez, keep
your hands to yourself!

236
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:43,666
[FINRAL]
Ah! They're useless!

237
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,916
What was I thinking
bringing these two?

238
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,083
None of my squadmates
are mixer material!

239
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:53,041
[ASTA] C'mon, stop it!
Look, they're bleeding again!

240
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:53,875
[LUCK]
Ooh, really?

241
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:54,958
[ASTA]
Well, no.

242
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:04,333
[NOELLE]
Maybe I didn't need to keep

243
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,125
an eye on things, after all.

244
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:09,166
The mixer doesn't look
like it's going well.

245
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,500
Not that I care.

246
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:13,416
Dorksta's social life has
nothing to do with me.

247
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,916
[CUSTOMER 28A]
Excuse me, miss! Over here!

248
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,625
Huh?

249
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:19,041
Another round, please.

250
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,125
Go get it yourself. I'm busy.

[CUSTOMER 28A]
Brr...

252
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:24,916
[SEKKE] So, you heard about
that business in the capital

253
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,875
the other day, right?

254
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:29,041
Well, I was there
guarding a VIP,

255
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:31,041
so I got in on the action, too.

256
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:33,291
Took out a fair number
of attackers myself,

257
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:35,291
as a matter of fact.

258
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:36,708
Ha, ha!

259
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:38,875
I didn't expect
to get a promotion

260
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:41,041
just for doing my duty, truly.

261
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:42,708
What's a boy to do, though?

262
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,041
I know I didn't
deserve the honor,

263
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:47,500
but they insisted, so, well...

264
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:51,583
[laughs] Oh, dear.
I may be a tad drunk.

265
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:53,291
On myself.

266
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:57,750
And what were you doing
during the attack?

267
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,625
Reading that dirty
book of yours?

268
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:00,958
What? Shut up.

269
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:04,250
You don't know what you're
talkin' about, Sekke.

270
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,541
Hey, something wrong?

271
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,666
Does being around us
make ya nervous?

272
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,000
[WOMEN sigh]

273
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,875
You've got nothing
to worry about, ladies.

274
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:13,041
We won't bite, I swear.

[WOMAN 28D]
He just squeezed that lemon

276
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:15,791
right on the chicken.

277
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:18,000
[WOMAN 28E] Just listening
to this guy makes me sick.

278
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:20,666
[NOELLE] Things look even
worse at that table.

279
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,166
Wait, haven't I met
that guy before?

280
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,875
I think...

Right! It's Ha, Ha!

282
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:28,208
I knew my Bronze Magic was good,

283
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:30,625
but I never suspected
it was <i>that</i> good.

284
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:33,958
Honestly, sometimes
I scare myself.

Hey, you there! Get me
another drink, at once!

[BOYS groan]

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,791
[gasps] So that's the magic
you use to cut hair? Cool!

288
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:48,916
Yep, this is it. Here, see?

289
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,958
Wow!

290
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:51,541
It doesn't take
much magic power,

291
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,583
but your control
has to be stellar.

His eyes are so genuine.

00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,750
How can someone that
bloodthirsty be so cute?

And why does it make
my stomach all tingly?

Oh, no!

298

Do I have a secret love
for dangerous men?

Hey, Luck.

Do you think I could
see your magic, too?

301
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:14,083
Yeah, sure. It's kinda
tight in here.

Nice. Well done, Luck.

00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,291
Wow.

308
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:30,166
I'll use my Spatial Magic
to take us there sometime.

309
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,500
How does that sound?

310
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,250
It sounds good, actually.

and not really my type,

but he's the best of the three.

315
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:43,458
He looks like a noble,
and Spatial Magic

316
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:46,250
does come in handy.
Plus, he's attentive.

00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:26,125
I'm Erika!

476
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,791
[mumbling] Hey, I'm
Gordon. You're pretty.

477
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:30,083
Will you be my friend?
That would make me happy.

478
00:23:30,166 --> 00:23:31,916
--You will, really? Thank you.

479
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,333
Ha, ha!

480
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:35,166
[mumbling] Will you please
give me your address, too?

481
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,500
I'll send letters.
Not too often.

482
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:37,416
Ha, ha, ha!

483
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,583
Or maybe one a day.

484
00:23:38,666 --> 00:23:39,708
[exhales]

485
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:41,791
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

486
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:44,708
[HELENE, ERIKA]
Ah! Somebody save me!

487
00:23:46,541 --> 00:23:48,291
[ASTA]
I'm gonna be the Wizard King.

488
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:50,541
I won't let anybody
get in my way.

489
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:52,250
Commoners can climb to the top.

490
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:53,375
I'll show them all!

491
00:23:53,458 --> 00:23:56,375
<i>Black Clover</i> , Page 29: "Path."

492
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:58,458
Not yet. I'm not done!

493
00:23:58,541 --> 00:24:00,833
My magic is never giving up!
