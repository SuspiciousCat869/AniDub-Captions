I'd like to hit on--

162
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:07,416
I mean, <i>get</i> on a mission, too.

163
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,291
[NOELLE]
Really.

164
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:10,291
What am I doing here?

165
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,375
[ASTA] Captain Yami's going
and he's taking Magna.

166
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,458
They both looked so serious.

167
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:22,166
What kind of mission is this?

168
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:33,833
[MAGNA sighs, growls]

169
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:40,541
[MAGNA]
Oh, man.

170
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:41,458
This is bad, all right.

171
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:42,750
[laughing]

172
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:46,541
[MAGNA]
Totally, seriously, crazy bad!

173
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:52,333
[SEIHI] From the looks
of it, the two of you...

174
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:54,125
...are done for.

175
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:13,291
[SEIHI] From the looks
of it, the two of you...

176
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,208
...are done for.

177
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:18,458
[SEIHI]
Flush!

178
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:19,166
[YAMI]
Two pair.

179
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:19,916
[MAGNA]
Nothin'.

180
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,416
[laughs]

181
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,416
[groans]

182
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,500
He got us, sir.

183
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,041
--[clothes rustling]
--[DEALER 8A] Mm...

184
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:33,416
[laughing] Oh.
That'll never get old.

185
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:37,333
I lost it all! That was
over half a year's wages.

186
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:38,833
It's a pleasure, Magna.

187
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:41,416
Always. You, too, Captain.

188
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,166
[laughs]

189
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,333
[SEIHI]
I'll be able to buy

190
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:47,291
a lot of nice souvenirs
for the village.

191
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:50,916
Deal us in for one more hand.

192
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,166
Really, sir?

193
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,875
Hey, now. You have
nothing left to wager.

194
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:56,333
Not even underwear.

195
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:59,125
It's true. He took
everything we had!

196
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:03,166
No, not yet. Here's my offer.

197
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,333
One last hand. That's all.

198
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:07,500
If we win, then you
give us back everything.

199
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:11,500
Oh? All right,
and what if you lose?

200
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:15,125
Uh...

201
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:17,875
Your prize.

202
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:19,375
You're kidding, right, sir?

203
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:21,500
Well, Gramps, what do ya say?

204
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:24,000
Please. You can't bet
that and you know it.

205
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,500
He's right. Come on, Captain!

206
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:29,541
Shut it! This is where
we push our limits!

207
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:32,458
I'm not so sure about this.

208
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,125
Hey, here's an idea.

209
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:39,000
You lose to me, and you have
to do any one thing I say.

210
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:39,833
Well?

211
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:41,333
Anything?

212
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:42,833
What, are you crazy?

213
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:44,583
Yami would never agree
to that kind of--

214
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:46,208
That works.

215
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:48,625
Yami agrees to the
terms of the wager.

216
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,000
Come on, Seihi, let's do this!

217
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:52,333
Say your prayers!

218
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:54,291
Hah! I don't think
I'm the one here

219
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:56,083
who needs to be praying.

220
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:26,250
[MAGNA]
Yeah. These'll do.

221
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:32,833
[sighs]

222
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:44,750
[SEIHI, YAMI, MAGNA]
Let's see 'em!

223
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:49,000
Okay. There, there.

224
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:51,833
Who's a good beastie?
Meat treat?

225
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:58,708
[ASTA yelps]

226
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:00,875
Don't just stand there. Help me!

227
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:03,208
Do I look like I feed animals?

228
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:05,250
You're lucky I even
came down here.

229
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:06,250
You should be thanking me.

230
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:07,666
Not gonna happen!

231
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,250
I thought I was dead for sure.

232
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:14,750
You truly are very strong.

233
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,083
That's because I train hard!

234
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:18,125
[YAMI, MAGNA laughing]

235
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:19,041
[MAGNA]
Man, that hand.

236
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,375
[ASTA]
Captain Yami and Magna.

237
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:23,625
So, then. The
mission must be--

238
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:24,875
[BOTH gasp]

239
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:28,000
[BOTH laughing]

240
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:29,416
[BOTH gasp]

241
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,708
That old man!

242
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:34,500
He actually pulled
out a royal flush. Ha!

243
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:37,041
Incredible. [laughs]

244
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:38,833
Shoulda known!

245
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:42,083
[MAGNA] We didn't stand
a chance against old Seihi.

246
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,000
He was motivated
to beat us today,

247
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:45,333
that's for damn sure.

248
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:48,208
[laughs]

249
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:50,916
[MAGNA]
Hey, there, Rasta. No-No.

250
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,375
We're back.

251
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:53,333
[laughing]

252
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:54,500
[MAGNA]
Guess what?

253
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,125
I got some news I think
you're gonna like.

254
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:58,500
It's time for your
first mission.

255
00:13:58,583 --> 00:13:59,625
[BOTH]
Huh?

256
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:00,708
Uh--

257
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:06,458
Like I said,

258
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:08,625
we've decided to put
you in the field.

259
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:10,125
All right, our first mission.

260
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:11,500
Here we go.

261
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,000
So, what are we doing?

262
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:15,208
I assume it's something
befitting royalty

263
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:16,625
such as myself.

264
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,750
Yeah, it's a real honor.

265
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:21,666
Go to Saussy Village
for some boar hunting.

266
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,291
Huh?

267
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:23,958
Hunting boar?

268
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:26,833
[BOAR 8A]
Oink!

269
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:30,458
Wow. That is a terrible mission.

270
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:31,583
No, it's not!

271
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:32,916
You take that back!

272
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,666
I can bring down a boar
with my bare hands, easy.

273
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,916
No, you can't!

274
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,166
Don't even think about trying!

275
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,708
Those things are pure evil.

276
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:42,708
They got beady eyes,
huge tusks,

277
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:44,791
and they charge for no reason!

278
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:47,041
[sighs]

279
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:49,333
We lost to the chief
of Saussy Village.

280
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:51,291
Now we gotta pay the price.

281
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:52,875
[NOELLE]
Huh?

282
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,333
[ASTA]
The two of you lost in a fight?

283
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:55,791
That doesn't even seem possible!

284
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:58,208
[NOELLE]
How powerful was this man?

285
00:14:58,291 --> 00:14:59,583
[YAMI]
We lost at poker.

286
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:00,833
[BOTH]
At poker?

287
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:03,583
He literally stripped us
of everything we had.

288
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:06,416
Including half a year's wages!

289
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,125
[ASTA]
Really?

290
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:10,125
[NOELLE]
Why would you brag about that?

291
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:11,666
That's not all.

292
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,750
We also promised we'd do any
one thing he requested of us.

293
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:17,375
And that turned out to be
gettin' rid of some boar.

294
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,125
There's been a herd
of 'em hangin' around

295
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:22,833
near the village. Trampling
fields and causing trouble.

296
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:28,541
Well. I'll head back
and wait for you there.

297
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:29,750
[YAMI]
Uh...

298
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:35,333
Oh, here, you can have
these back at least.

299
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:42,875
[SEIHI laughs]

300
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,166
Ooh! Ooh!

301
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,500
Can you explain what
this has to do with us?

302
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:47,958
Yes, exactly.

303
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:50,250
You were the ones who lost.
It was none of our doing.

304
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:50,791
So, why--

305
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,250
You idiots!

306
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:55,958
Do you seriously expect Yami
to clean up his own mess?

307
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:57,500
[ASTA]
Oh, y-yeah.

308
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,083
[NOELLE]
It seems reasonable.

309
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,958
Yami doesn't deal
with these things.

310
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:03,541
That's what he's got us for.

311
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:15,791
[YAMI]
Either go or die. Your choice.

312
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:17,041
[ASTA, NOELLE]
We'll go!

313
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:21,416
So what if it's boar hunting?

314
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,208
We're finally
going on a mission!

315
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:24,750
I'm getting pumped now!

316
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:27,625
Yeah!

317
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:30,000
I still don't see why
he would be sending me.

318
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:31,333
[MAGNA]
Come on!

319
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:33,416
Do you ever do
anything but complain?

320
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,208
Actually, that wasn't
intended as a complaint.

321
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:37,625
It's just...

322
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:41,083
Given that I can't
control my magic power,

323
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,083
should I really be going
on a mission at a--?

324
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:44,041
[MAGNA]
Dummy!

325
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:44,916
[NOELLE gasps]

326
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,125
That's the whole point!

327
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:47,416
How do you expect
to get any better

328
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,875
if you aren't even
willing to try?

329
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:50,333
[NOELLE gasps]

330
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:51,708
Besides,

331
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:53,291
we're not sending some
wet-behind-the-ears recruits

332
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:54,458
out there alone.

333
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:56,458
I'll be around to keep
an eye on you two.

334
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:59,791
Wow! You're such
a manly man, Magna!

335
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:02,666
Aw, 'nough of that,
Rasta. I'm blushing.

336
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,208
Well...

337
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:07,416
If you insist, I suppose I would
be willing to accompany you.

338
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,041
[MAGNA]
Really? Wow, thank you!

339
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:12,083
Wait a minute! How come you're
always lookin' down on us, huh?

340
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:14,458
It isn't that I choose
to look down on you.

341
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:17,583
You just always happen to be
below me, so what else can I do?

342
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:19,916
What kind of logic is that?

343
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,166
Do your thing.

344
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:27,208
Use your Spatial Magic to
send us to Saussy Village.

345
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:29,000
Saussy Village?

346
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:30,583
Mm...

347
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:31,750
No can do.

348
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,625
Come on, it's not like
I'm asking a lot.

349
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:35,125
Now, now.

350
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:37,875
I can go to distant places,
but only if I've marked them

351
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:39,625
with my magic power before.

352
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:40,750
Huh?

353
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:42,041
In other words,

354
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,125
you wanna go somewhere
I've never been?

355
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:46,708
Sorry, can't do it.

356
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:47,875
[NOELLE]
Uh--

357
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,375
Well, that was a waste of time.

358
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:56,416
Fine, we'll have to
go by broom, then.

359
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,333
[ASTA]
Uh-- Um, Magna, sir.

360
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:00,750
Yeah, what is it?

361
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:03,375
[ASTA]
I... can't fly on a broom.

362
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:04,000
[NOELLE]
Um--

363
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,333
Yeah, what is it?

364
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:06,458
[NOELLE]
What he said.

365
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:08,458
[MAGNA groans]

366
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:11,208
[MAGNA yells]
Are you two kidding me?

367
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,875
You're so completely incompetent
that you can't manage

368
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,333
something that freakin' simple?

369
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:18,208
Flying is pretty much the
most basic skill a mage has!

370
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:20,583
I don't have any
magic power, remember?

371
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,083
[laughs]

372
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:23,750
Why do you look so proud? Huh?

373
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:26,125
And since I can't
control my magic power,

374
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:27,791
a broom is out of the question.

375
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:28,791
Obviously.

376
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:31,208
And why are you
being so arrogant?

377
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:33,875
Ugh. Fine.

378
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:38,541
[MAGNA] We'll just
have to ride together.

379
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:41,041
Are you ready to meet my baby?

380
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:43,791
[BOTH]
Your baby?

381
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,666
Here it is.

382
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,916
Introducing Crazy Cyclone!

383
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:53,250
Whoa. So cool!

385
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,625
[MAGNA] I know, right?
Awesome, isn't it?

386
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:00,000
Yeah! Way awesome.

387
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:00,750
Try "lame."

388
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:02,208
[MAGNA]
Excuse me?

389
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:04,166
Are you so blind that you
can't even recognize beauty

390
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,000
when you're starin' right at it?

391
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:10,083
It's lame!

Take us up, Magna!

396
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:22,958
You can't do it, can you?

Let's do this thing!
