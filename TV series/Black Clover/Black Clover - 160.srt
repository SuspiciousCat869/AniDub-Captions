[NARRATOR] Asta, born
unable to harness mana,

was granted the
power of Anti-magic

from his five-leaf grimoire,

5

giving him the ability
to nullify spells.

powers from the devils

to launch an invasion on
their neighboring countries.

Gaining strength from
his belief in himself

Apparently, he got a message

30

from his hometown, so he
had to finish up a mission

Uh-huh!

With the amount of magic
he has, it's hard to believe

that he comes from
the Forsaken Realm.

Who are you,

00:09:27,432 --> 00:09:30,560
[ROYAL 160A] The Zogratis
siblings have returned!

161
00:09:30,643 --> 00:09:34,022
[LOYCE] Your subjugation
mission was a success.

162
00:09:34,105 --> 00:09:36,816
Now, please take
some time to recover.

163
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,069
We need you at your best
to maintain peace

164
00:09:39,152 --> 00:09:41,988
in the Spade Kingdom.

165
00:09:42,072 --> 00:09:44,824
For peace. Yes, of course.

166
00:09:44,908 --> 00:09:46,951
As you wish, sire.

167
00:09:49,621 --> 00:09:53,416
Those three siblings.
Keep a close eye on them.

168
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,044
But why do you say that, Father?

169
00:09:56,127 --> 00:09:58,254
I have a bad feeling.

170
00:09:58,338 --> 00:10:00,590
[RALPH]
Oh.

171
00:10:00,674 --> 00:10:01,883
Loyce, Darling.

172
00:10:01,966 --> 00:10:04,678
Did those three kill
that group of rebels?

173
00:10:04,761 --> 00:10:05,762
[LOYCE]
Yes.

174
00:10:05,845 --> 00:10:08,181
Were they acting
on orders from you?

175
00:10:08,264 --> 00:10:09,516
[LOYCE]
Don't be absurd!

176
00:10:09,599 --> 00:10:11,768
[cries]

177
00:10:11,851 --> 00:10:14,229
[CIEL]
There, there, it's all right!

178
00:10:14,312 --> 00:10:17,315
For some reason,
I just don't trust them.

179
00:10:21,653 --> 00:10:24,280
[RALPH]
I wonder why Father said that.

180
00:10:24,364 --> 00:10:27,867
All I know is nothing will
shake my loyalty to this land!

181
00:10:29,577 --> 00:10:31,538
[RALPH grunts]

182
00:10:31,621 --> 00:10:34,040
[RALPH'S BUDDY 160A] Hey, Ralph,
you ready to take a break?

183
00:10:34,124 --> 00:10:37,502
Yeah. Might as well.
Thanks, buddy.

184
00:10:42,132 --> 00:10:45,135
[RALPH] Those three turned out
to be the Dark Triad.

185
00:10:45,218 --> 00:10:47,887
If I had listened
to my father's words,

186
00:10:47,971 --> 00:10:51,141
we may have been able to
avoid that terrible tragedy.

187
00:10:53,476 --> 00:10:54,769
[VOICE 160A]
Treason!

188
00:10:54,853 --> 00:10:56,396
[VOICE 160B] The Zogratis
siblings are attacking

189
00:10:56,479 --> 00:10:57,897
the castle!

190
00:11:03,945 --> 00:11:09,451
This is great! [giggles]

191
00:11:09,534 --> 00:11:10,535
You traitors!

192
00:11:10,618 --> 00:11:11,536
Stop right there!

193
00:11:11,619 --> 00:11:14,414
Oh, boy, I'm so excited! Yay!

194
00:11:14,497 --> 00:11:17,167
I get to stack up
even more dead bodies!

195
00:11:18,335 --> 00:11:19,836
I don't believe it.

196
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:22,797
[MAGE 160A] They're wiping out
the entire Mage Defense Force!

197
00:11:22,881 --> 00:11:25,550
We can't stop them!
They're too strong!

198
00:11:25,633 --> 00:11:27,969
It was true all along;
those three have been

199
00:11:28,053 --> 00:11:30,513
bestowed with the power
of the underworld!

200
00:11:30,597 --> 00:11:33,600
[DANTE chuckles]

201
00:11:33,683 --> 00:11:36,186
Dante. How could you?

202
00:11:53,703 --> 00:11:55,955
[RALPH] Father! Where are
the king and queen?

203
00:11:58,291 --> 00:11:59,334
Are they...?

204
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:03,588
The kingdom's future
was left with me.

205
00:12:03,672 --> 00:12:07,342
They're all just so weak!
It's kinda boring, honestly.

206
00:12:07,425 --> 00:12:11,221
Then I'll buy us
some time. Hurry!

207
00:12:11,304 --> 00:12:13,223
Don't you think so?

208
00:12:13,306 --> 00:12:14,516
I suppose.

209
00:12:14,599 --> 00:12:15,600
Thank you.

210
00:12:15,684 --> 00:12:17,727
I swore I'd protect him
with my life.

211
00:12:17,811 --> 00:12:19,729
Make sure you survive!

212
00:12:21,606 --> 00:12:23,274
I will, Father!

213
00:12:24,776 --> 00:12:26,820
[RALPH yells]

214
00:12:26,903 --> 00:12:30,740
[RALPH] That night was the
last time I ever saw him.

215
00:12:34,869 --> 00:12:36,663
[MAGE 160A]
Is the prince all right?

216
00:12:36,746 --> 00:12:37,539
Yes.

217
00:12:37,622 --> 00:12:39,082
He's not safe here.

218
00:12:39,165 --> 00:12:41,918
If they found him, they most
likely wouldn't kill him, but...

219
00:12:42,002 --> 00:12:44,004
[RALPH'S FATHER]
They'll kidnap him, for sure.

220
00:12:44,087 --> 00:12:46,297
Exactly, they have
no right to the throne,

221
00:12:46,381 --> 00:12:48,967
so they'll try
to take him alive.

222
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:50,427
[RALPH'S FATHER] What makes
you think it's the throne

223
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,637
those villains are after?

224
00:12:52,721 --> 00:12:54,014
What else could it be?

225
00:12:54,097 --> 00:12:55,390
Couldn't say.

226
00:12:55,473 --> 00:12:59,060
But I sense that their
intentions are deeply sinister.

227
00:12:59,144 --> 00:13:01,271
We can't let them
have Prince Yuno.

228
00:13:01,354 --> 00:13:04,149
The Zogratis siblings know
all of this kingdom's secrets,

229
00:13:04,232 --> 00:13:06,943
just as we do.
We must leave, now.

230
00:13:08,236 --> 00:13:10,113
Do as we discussed!

231
00:13:11,531 --> 00:13:13,742
[PURSUER 160A] They've gone
in three separate directions!

232
00:13:30,633 --> 00:13:32,510
[whimpers]

233
00:13:32,594 --> 00:13:34,971
Don't cry.
Everything's all right.

234
00:13:35,055 --> 00:13:38,558
After all, I swore on my life
that I'd always keep you safe.

235
00:13:38,641 --> 00:13:39,851
And I'm sure

236
00:13:39,934 --> 00:13:43,063
that stone will help
protect you, as well.

237
00:13:43,146 --> 00:13:47,984
[YUNO crying]

238
00:13:48,068 --> 00:13:49,903
The strong magic region!

239
00:13:49,986 --> 00:13:51,905
There's no way he'll make it!

240
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:54,866
What should we do, sir?

241
00:13:54,949 --> 00:13:56,409
[ZENON]
Doesn't matter.

242
00:13:56,493 --> 00:14:00,497
But if the prince lives,
we'll have a problem, won't we?

243
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,624
If that concerns you,
then kill him.

244
00:14:02,707 --> 00:14:04,084
[BOTH]
Er, right!

245
00:14:09,255 --> 00:14:14,010
[RALPH'S FATHER panting]

246
00:14:14,094 --> 00:14:17,597
[RALPH'S FATHER] I will
protect you, whatever it takes!

247
00:14:21,518 --> 00:14:23,019
[RALPH'S FATHER]
Prince Yuno!

248
00:14:32,362 --> 00:14:35,156
[RALPH'S FATHER]
That's... a church.

249
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,283
He'll be safe there.

250
00:14:37,367 --> 00:14:41,329
[RALPH'S FATHER] This will be my
final spell for you, my prince.

251
00:14:43,456 --> 00:14:45,917
Now, live, and be strong!

252
00:14:51,798 --> 00:14:53,383
[RALPH'S FATHER]
That was fast.

253
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:59,264
[RALPH'S FATHER] I led them
far away from the church.

254
00:14:59,347 --> 00:15:02,225
They shouldn't be able
to find him now.

255
00:15:02,308 --> 00:15:05,770
Stay safe, Prince Yuno.

256
00:15:05,854 --> 00:15:07,647
I refuse to be killed by you!

257
00:15:07,731 --> 00:15:09,065
[BOTH gasp]

258
00:15:13,778 --> 00:15:15,780
[BOTH scream]

259
00:15:18,533 --> 00:15:22,704
[RALPH'S FATHER] Ralph.
The future is in your hands.

260
00:15:25,665 --> 00:15:27,792
[YUNO gasps]

261
00:15:27,876 --> 00:15:29,544
[LILY]
Yuno.

262
00:15:36,092 --> 00:15:38,303
Considering the massive
amount of mana you have,

263
00:15:38,386 --> 00:15:40,638
I assume you're able to see
that everything I showed you

264
00:15:40,722 --> 00:15:42,515
actually happened.

265
00:15:42,599 --> 00:15:45,393
There were no lies
in any part of it.

266
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:47,896
Yeah, well, that's exactly
what a liar would say!

267
00:15:47,979 --> 00:15:50,940
Don't believe this creep, Yuno!

268
00:15:51,024 --> 00:15:53,151
My family served the
House of Grinberryall

269
00:15:53,234 --> 00:15:55,945
for generations.
It's not just me.

270
00:15:56,029 --> 00:15:57,197
You have countless subjects

271
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,449
praying for your
safety, your Highness.

272
00:15:59,532 --> 00:16:02,369
And they're in grave danger!

273
00:16:02,452 --> 00:16:05,789
[chiming]

274
00:16:05,872 --> 00:16:07,457
What's wrong?

275
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,709
[DAVID]
There's trouble, sir!

276
00:16:09,793 --> 00:16:12,128
[GOLDEN DAWN 154A] The
headquarters is under attack!

277
00:16:12,212 --> 00:16:14,297
Please help us!

278
00:16:14,381 --> 00:16:15,632
Oh, no!

279
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:29,437
We're allowed to have
as much fun as we want.

280
00:16:31,106 --> 00:16:33,024
Right, Lord Zenon?

281
00:16:33,108 --> 00:16:37,153
As long as you leave the
arcane-stage Magic Knight alive.

282
00:16:41,032 --> 00:16:42,325
Yuno?

283
00:16:42,409 --> 00:16:43,952
[RALPH]
Please wait, sir!

284
00:16:44,035 --> 00:16:46,913
If they were able to enter
the Clover Kingdom that easily,

285
00:16:46,996 --> 00:16:50,041
they must be the Dark Triad,
or someone just as strong!

286
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:51,793
You can't be rash!

287
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:56,923
Sorry, but I am the vice
captain of the Golden Dawn!

288
00:16:58,967 --> 00:17:00,176
[YUNO grunts]

289
00:17:02,262 --> 00:17:05,724
[RALPH]
Prince Yuno! I'll go, too!

290
00:17:05,807 --> 00:17:07,058
I will--

291
00:17:07,142 --> 00:17:09,144
[LILY]
No, you need to stay in bed.

292
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,147
Yuno.

293
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:14,107
Let me guess, you look scary
'cause you're thinking

294
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:15,442
about all the different
ways you're gonna

295
00:17:15,525 --> 00:17:16,901
punish the bad guys.

296
00:17:16,985 --> 00:17:20,030
I'm right, aren't I?
I'm so smart!

297
00:17:20,113 --> 00:17:22,741
[RALPH] You belong to the
House of Grinberryall.

298
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:28,371
[RALPH] Its scion, the prince
of the Spade Kingdom!

299
00:17:28,455 --> 00:17:32,334
[YUNO] Even so, I'm also Yuno
of the Clover Kingdom.

300
00:17:32,417 --> 00:17:34,419
I need to get there faster!

301
00:17:41,968 --> 00:17:46,097
From the looks of them,
they're Spade Kingdom mages!

302
00:17:46,181 --> 00:17:48,641
I don't know how they got here,
but they must be tough

303
00:17:48,725 --> 00:17:52,354
if they made it into
our headquarters!

304
00:17:52,437 --> 00:17:53,855
Teach them a lesson!

305
00:17:53,938 --> 00:17:57,025
Go! Blast 'em with
your attack spells!

306
00:18:08,495 --> 00:18:09,746
What?

307
00:18:11,206 --> 00:18:11,956
What the--?

308
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,625
They're not hurt?

309
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:15,543
[DAVID]
But where'd the other one go?

310
00:18:23,176 --> 00:18:26,513
[GADEROIS] Come on!
Is that the best you can do?

311
00:18:26,596 --> 00:18:28,223
But I heard you guys
were supposed to be

312
00:18:28,306 --> 00:18:30,892
the toughest squad
in the Clover Kingdom!

313
00:18:30,975 --> 00:18:32,811
Well. Guess I can't blame you.

314
00:18:32,894 --> 00:18:35,063
Only a select few were
good enough to get powers

315
00:18:35,146 --> 00:18:38,358
from the Dark Triad, and we
were at the top of the list!

316
00:18:38,441 --> 00:18:43,530
We're the Dark Disciples!
All of us are stage-zero mages!

317
00:18:43,613 --> 00:18:45,699
Stage zero? No way!

318
00:18:49,452 --> 00:18:50,745
He's gone!

319
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:57,168
Hey! Stone Magic, just like me!

320
00:18:58,586 --> 00:18:59,921
[GADEROIS yells]

321
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:02,424
Too bad you're such a weakling!

322
00:19:03,466 --> 00:19:04,592
Shiren--!

323

[GOLDEN DAWN MAGES groan]

[GOLDEN DAWN 160B screams]

325
00:19:14,644 --> 00:19:16,062
When you've got a devil's power,

326
00:19:16,146 --> 00:19:18,606
it takes your magic
to a new level!

327
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:21,818
Our army captains can
do about five percent.

328
00:19:21,901 --> 00:19:25,071
But I'm strong enough
to unleash closer to 40!

329
00:19:26,489 --> 00:19:29,284
[GADEROIS] And since
Lord Zenon's possessed...

330
00:19:31,286 --> 00:19:34,247
[GADEROIS]
...he's got upwards of 80!

331
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:36,041
So here you are.

332
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:40,378
You're Captain Vangeance
of the Golden Dawn.

333
00:19:40,462 --> 00:19:42,213
We hear you're one
of the few Magic Knights

334
00:19:42,297 --> 00:19:44,966
whose power has reached
the arcane stage.

335
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,926
[WILLIAM]
This mana...

336
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:48,094
[ALECDORA]
Stop!

337
00:19:48,178 --> 00:19:50,680
Get away from Lord
Vangeance, right now!

338
00:19:50,764 --> 00:19:53,933
Stand down, Alecdora!
They're too powerful!

339
00:19:54,017 --> 00:19:56,728
Last time, I allowed myself
to become possessed,

340
00:19:56,811 --> 00:20:00,440
but this is my chance to stand
up and fight for my captain!

341
00:20:00,523 --> 00:20:01,816
They will kill you!

342
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,486
As a Magic Knight
of the Golden Dawn...

343
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:09,783
[ALECDORA]
...I will strike you down!

344
00:20:12,327 --> 00:20:14,829
[ALECDORA grunts]

345
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:16,623
[ALECDORA]
What did he do?

346
00:20:19,626 --> 00:20:23,296
[WILLIAM] World Tree Magic:
Magic Warding Ash!

347
00:20:26,341 --> 00:20:29,636
Lord Vangeance. Thank you.

348
00:20:29,719 --> 00:20:31,846
Devil-possessed or not,

349
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:36,142
you'll pay dearly for causing
harm to my subordinates!

350
00:20:36,226 --> 00:20:39,270
So that's World
Tree Magic, is it?

351
00:20:39,354 --> 00:20:42,565
Our side could
certainly use that.

352
00:20:42,649 --> 00:20:45,819
I'll be taking you with me.

353
00:20:45,902 --> 00:20:48,863
[ZENON]
Bone Magic: Eternal Fangs.

354
00:20:55,912 --> 00:20:57,122
I'm here!

355
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:14,139
Someone else joining the fun?

356
00:21:14,222 --> 00:21:16,641
Sorry, buddy, you're
late to the party.

357
00:21:19,853 --> 00:21:23,523
[YUNO] What the hell do
you think you're doing...

358
00:21:25,316 --> 00:21:27,193
...to my comrades?

359
00:23:01,871 --> 00:23:03,623

[DAVID]
"Yuno's Fan Clubs"!

361
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:10,755
Who cares where he's from?

362
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:14,300
What matters is that Yuno's an
extremely talented Magic Knight!

363
00:23:14,384 --> 00:23:17,303
Uh-oh. So that's how it is, huh?

364
00:23:17,387 --> 00:23:18,888
Sorry?

365
00:23:18,972 --> 00:23:20,932
[DAVID]
You'd better get in line.

366
00:23:21,016 --> 00:23:22,434
Wha...?

367
00:23:22,517 --> 00:23:24,894
[DAVID] Yuno has insane fan
clubs all over the kingdom,

368
00:23:24,978 --> 00:23:26,479
just so you know.

369
00:23:26,563 --> 00:23:27,814
Duh, of course I know about

370
00:23:27,897 --> 00:23:29,774
the fan clubs; who do you
think is the president

371
00:23:29,858 --> 00:23:31,526
of the Golden Dawn chapter?

372
00:23:31,609 --> 00:23:33,653
[DAVID]
There's a Golden Dawn chapter?

373
00:23:33,737 --> 00:23:35,530
You said yourself,
they're all over the kingdom,

374
00:23:35,613 --> 00:23:38,783
and this is the squad Yuno's in,
so why wouldn't we have one?

375
00:23:38,867 --> 00:23:39,993
Right.

376
00:23:40,076 --> 00:23:41,327
[GOLDEN DAWN 154AA]
I have buttons, folders,

00:23:43,246 --> 00:23:45,582
of Yuno merchandise that exists!

379
00:23:45,665 --> 00:23:49,044
And of course,
I follow his social media!

380
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:53,173
Wait, really? You mean
Yuno's on the internet?

381
00:23:53,256 --> 00:23:54,507
[YUNO chuckles]

382

[YUNO]
You monster.

383
00:23:58,428 --> 00:24:01,014
I won't let you do this
to my squadmates!
