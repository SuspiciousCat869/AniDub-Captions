1
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,264
[NARRATOR]
The Clover Kingdom.

2
00:00:24,347 --> 00:00:26,725
In this place where
magic is everything,

3
00:00:26,808 --> 00:00:30,145
there lives one boy
who was born without it.

4
00:00:30,228 --> 00:00:33,314
His name is Asta.

5
00:00:33,398 --> 00:00:34,774
His strength and determination

6
00:00:34,858 --> 00:00:37,110
helped him become
a Magic Knight.

7
00:00:37,193 --> 00:00:39,779
And despite the many
challenges he faces,

8
00:00:39,863 --> 00:00:43,283
he aims for the top
and refuses to give up!

9
00:00:43,366 --> 00:00:44,993
Rich or poor,

10
00:00:45,076 --> 00:00:46,953
royalty or commoner,

11
00:00:47,037 --> 00:00:49,748
Asta believes anyone can shine.

12
00:00:49,831 --> 00:00:52,709
His mission is to prove
that to the whole world

13
00:00:52,792 --> 00:00:55,670
and to become the
next Wizard King!

14
00:00:59,966 --> 00:01:02,385
[GREY]
I can't stay like this.

15
00:01:02,469 --> 00:01:05,305
Finral's becoming
a more reliable person.

16
00:01:05,388 --> 00:01:08,308
Gordon's improving
his social skills.

17
00:01:08,391 --> 00:01:11,269
Both Magna and Luck
have gotten stronger.

18
00:01:11,353 --> 00:01:14,731
And Noelle's learning one
great spell after another.

19
00:01:14,814 --> 00:01:17,901
Asta's been moving forward
since the beginning.

20
00:01:17,984 --> 00:01:20,403
Even Gauche has become
more approachable.

21
00:01:20,487 --> 00:01:22,364
I think.

22
00:01:22,447 --> 00:01:24,991
Everyone's getting better,
and here I am,

23
00:01:25,075 --> 00:01:27,619
still embarrassed
to let people see me.

24
00:01:27,702 --> 00:01:30,038
I'm so afraid!

25
00:01:30,121 --> 00:01:32,832
I'm not like I was back then.

26
00:01:32,916 --> 00:01:34,668
But I wanna learn
how to feel comfortable

27
00:01:34,751 --> 00:01:37,921
when I'm in my true form!

28
00:01:38,004 --> 00:01:39,714
[GREY whimpers]

29
00:01:45,595 --> 00:01:48,014
[GREY]
It's time for me to change, too!

30
00:03:22,525 --> 00:03:24,861
[rapid footsteps]

31
00:03:26,237 --> 00:03:28,740
Grey? What's wrong?

32
00:03:28,823 --> 00:03:30,867
Are you okay? What happened?

33
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:32,535
Please excuse me!

34
00:03:32,619 --> 00:03:34,913
Are you feeling
sick or something?

35
00:03:34,996 --> 00:03:36,122
[GREY]
Noelle!

36
00:03:36,206 --> 00:03:39,084
I'd like you to take me
on as your student!

37
00:03:39,167 --> 00:03:41,336
Huh? My student?

38
00:03:41,419 --> 00:03:44,297
[GREY] Yes, I'm hoping
to overcome my shyness.

39
00:03:44,381 --> 00:03:45,799
Why is that?

40
00:03:45,882 --> 00:03:48,760
We're preparing to battle
a devil and the Spade Kingdom,

41
00:03:48,843 --> 00:03:52,097
but how can I help you guys
if I'm too embarrassed to fight?

42
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,099
That's easy, just transform.

43
00:03:54,182 --> 00:03:56,559
No, that's not good enough!

44
00:03:56,643 --> 00:03:59,062
I want to succeed
in my true form.

45
00:03:59,145 --> 00:04:00,605
But why learn from me?

46
00:04:00,689 --> 00:04:04,317
Almost all our teammates
are pretty confident people.

47
00:04:04,401 --> 00:04:06,903
You're the only one who
can help me with this!

48
00:04:06,986 --> 00:04:11,074
After all, you have that
royal poise and assertiveness!

49
00:04:11,157 --> 00:04:15,578
I would be so happy
if I could be more like you!

50
00:04:15,662 --> 00:04:18,456
Well, you have good judgment.
I'll give you that.

51
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,458
If it's that important
to you, then I suppose

52
00:04:20,542 --> 00:04:22,794
I can spare a little
of my royal time.

53
00:04:22,877 --> 00:04:24,963
Oh, thanks, you're the best!

54
00:04:25,046 --> 00:04:27,340
Just so you know,
I won't go easy on you.

55
00:04:27,424 --> 00:04:30,427
[gasps] Right!
I'm ready to learn!

56
00:04:32,679 --> 00:04:34,305
The first thing you need
to do is stop getting

57
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:36,558
all flustered when
somebody looks at you.

58
00:04:36,641 --> 00:04:38,351
Uh. 'Kay, I'll try!

59
00:04:38,435 --> 00:04:41,479
[NOELLE] I'm about to look
at you, so just act normal.

60
00:04:41,563 --> 00:04:42,814
[GREY whimpers]

61
00:04:42,897 --> 00:04:44,482
You're still covering your face!

62
00:04:44,566 --> 00:04:46,276
[GREY]
I can't help it!

63
00:04:46,359 --> 00:04:47,777
Ugh. Fine.

64
00:04:47,861 --> 00:04:50,321
I'm closing my eyes,
does that help you?

65
00:04:50,405 --> 00:04:53,408
Uh... Yes, that's much better.

66
00:04:54,492 --> 00:04:56,703
[GREY yelps]

67
00:04:56,786 --> 00:04:58,496
Let's try again.

68
00:05:01,124 --> 00:05:02,917
[GREY yelps]

69
00:05:03,001 --> 00:05:04,711
[NOELLE]
She's hopeless.

70
00:05:04,794 --> 00:05:08,089
I know. How about this?

71
00:05:08,173 --> 00:05:09,966
[GREY]
Uh...

72
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,926
I'm farther away now.

73
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:14,471
[GREY] It doesn't matter,
you're still looking.

74
00:05:14,554 --> 00:05:16,723
[NOELLE]
I've got my work cut out for me.

75
00:05:16,806 --> 00:05:18,224
[GORDON]
Let me assist you.

76
00:05:18,308 --> 00:05:19,392
[NOELLE, GREY gasp]

77
00:05:19,476 --> 00:05:20,894
[NOELLE]
Gordon!

78
00:05:20,977 --> 00:05:22,228
[GORDON]
I'm always acutely aware

79
00:05:22,312 --> 00:05:25,106
of my friends' whereabouts
and what they're up to.

80
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,441
So, naturally, I've been here

81
00:05:26,524 --> 00:05:28,651
watching you guys
this whole time.

82
00:05:28,735 --> 00:05:30,028
[NOELLE]
Of course.

83
00:05:30,111 --> 00:05:31,946
[GREY]
I'm so ashamed!

84
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,615
There's nothing I would
enjoy more than a chance

85
00:05:33,698 --> 00:05:35,283
to help my very
best buddy to become

86
00:05:35,367 --> 00:05:37,744
an even more wonderful person.

87
00:05:37,827 --> 00:05:40,205
A living being creates
too much pressure.

88
00:05:40,288 --> 00:05:42,874
Start with the lifeless
stares of my dolls.

89
00:05:42,957 --> 00:05:44,584
[NOELLE]
Taking it in baby steps.

90
00:05:44,668 --> 00:05:46,753
That's not such a bad idea.

91
00:05:46,836 --> 00:05:48,838
[GORDON] We'll do our best
not to look at you.

92
00:05:48,922 --> 00:05:50,632
So try having a chat with them.

93
00:05:50,715 --> 00:05:52,550
[GREY]
Uh, okay!

94
00:05:52,634 --> 00:05:54,552
[GORDON mimicking MAGNA]
Yo, Grey!

95
00:05:54,636 --> 00:05:55,887
It's only a doll!

96
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:57,931
You shouldn't be
this uncomfortable!

97
00:05:58,014 --> 00:06:00,392
Right. Good morning.

98
00:06:00,475 --> 00:06:01,810
[NOELLE]
Say it like you mean it!

99
00:06:01,893 --> 00:06:03,561
[GREY]
I can't.

100
00:06:04,688 --> 00:06:06,523
He's looking into my soul!

101
00:06:06,606 --> 00:06:10,026
Toughen up!
Be like me, remember?

102
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,070
[GREY]
Be like Noelle.

103
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:15,156
I'm not afraid of a dumb doll.

104
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,492
[NOELLE]
That defeats the whole purpose!

105
00:06:17,575 --> 00:06:19,452
[GREY]
You're right. I'm sorry!

106
00:06:19,536 --> 00:06:22,247
Now, keep that same
confidence as Grey.

107
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:25,500
Like, you still transform,
but only in your mind!

108
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:28,461
[GREY]
I dunno, that sounds hard.

109
00:06:28,545 --> 00:06:30,380
Humph! I'm much
too sophisticated

110
00:06:30,463 --> 00:06:31,840
to let this humiliate me!

111
00:06:31,923 --> 00:06:34,259
You probably shouldn't
jump straight to my level.

112
00:06:34,342 --> 00:06:35,844
I'm royalty, y'know.

113
00:06:35,927 --> 00:06:37,762
What am I supposed to do?

114
00:06:37,846 --> 00:06:40,181
Maybe you'd do better
if you started with Asta.

115
00:06:40,265 --> 00:06:43,018
He's a lot easier to imitate.

116
00:06:43,101 --> 00:06:45,520
[GREY]
Right. Asta.

117
00:06:45,603 --> 00:06:48,732
Hey, how's it goin', Charmy?
Anything good for lunch today?

118
00:06:48,815 --> 00:06:50,358
There you go, keep it up!

119
00:06:50,442 --> 00:06:52,652
Perfect impression.

120
00:06:52,736 --> 00:06:54,612
[GREY] Noelle. You're
an awesome fighter!

121
00:06:54,696 --> 00:06:56,239
It's great to know
you always have my back

122
00:06:56,322 --> 00:06:57,657
when I'm kicking butt!

123
00:06:57,741 --> 00:06:59,826
We're gonna be up against
some real tough guys soon,

124
00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:02,871
but everything'll be okay
as long as you're there!

125
00:07:02,954 --> 00:07:04,456
Why would he say that to me?

126
00:07:04,539 --> 00:07:06,958
Yeah, I'm amazing,
but that's a bit much.

127
00:07:07,042 --> 00:07:10,754
[GREY] Anyway, I appreciate it,
but I need to stop talking now.

128
00:07:12,088 --> 00:07:13,298
It can be hard to change

129
00:07:13,381 --> 00:07:15,216
when that's all
you've ever known.

130
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,843
I'm sorry, Grey.
I've done my best,

131
00:07:16,926 --> 00:07:18,762
but I don't know if there's
any other useful advice

132
00:07:18,845 --> 00:07:20,305
I can give you about this.

133
00:07:20,388 --> 00:07:22,599
I can't say I understand what
it's like to get embarrassed

134
00:07:22,682 --> 00:07:24,476
when somebody looks at me.

135
00:07:24,559 --> 00:07:27,062
I regret that I wasn't
the best teacher.

136
00:07:27,145 --> 00:07:30,190
I only hope our friendship
can weather this storm.

137
00:07:30,273 --> 00:07:32,525
[GREY whimpers]

138
00:07:34,736 --> 00:07:36,154
[GREY]
Hey.

139
00:07:36,237 --> 00:07:37,405
What's up, Grey?

140
00:07:37,489 --> 00:07:39,866
Any reason you're
walking around as me?

141
00:07:39,949 --> 00:07:41,785
I have a favor to ask you.

142
00:07:41,868 --> 00:07:42,994
What?

143
00:07:43,078 --> 00:07:45,163
[GREY]
Please be my mentor.

144
00:07:45,246 --> 00:07:46,706
But what would I teach you?

145
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:49,042
Our magic styles are
totally different.

146
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:50,293
If I'm in my true form,

147
00:07:50,377 --> 00:07:53,004
I'm too embarrassed for
other people to see me.

148
00:07:53,088 --> 00:07:55,298
I want to learn how
to be bolder like you.

149
00:07:55,382 --> 00:07:57,967
Tch. Why's this my job?

150
00:07:58,051 --> 00:08:00,053
Get lost. I'm too busy.

151
00:08:00,136 --> 00:08:03,431
Don't be selfish.
I need your help.

152
00:08:03,515 --> 00:08:04,724
Yeah, but fixing your problem

153
00:08:04,808 --> 00:08:07,310
doesn't really
benefit me, does it?

154
00:08:07,394 --> 00:08:08,687
Okay, then.

155
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:12,732
In return, you get to
ask me to do something.

156
00:08:12,816 --> 00:08:14,067
[gasps]

157
00:08:17,195 --> 00:08:18,613
What's all this for?

158
00:08:18,697 --> 00:08:22,492
Turn yourself into Marie
and read this script verbatim.

159
00:08:22,575 --> 00:08:23,618
First...

160
00:08:23,702 --> 00:08:24,994
I love you, Gauche!

161
00:08:25,078 --> 00:08:26,996
[GAUCHE]
That one's a must! And then...

162
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,499
I worked really hard
to make this meal for you!

163
00:08:29,582 --> 00:08:30,542
Enjoy it!

164
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:31,918
[GAUCHE]
This next one is crucial.

165
00:08:32,002 --> 00:08:35,880
Let's be together
forever, Big Brother!

166
00:08:35,964 --> 00:08:36,965
It's a long list,

167
00:08:37,048 --> 00:08:38,842
but say each one of them
with conviction!

168
00:08:38,925 --> 00:08:41,803
[GREY] Even hearing it from
a fake Marie is enough?

169
00:08:41,886 --> 00:08:44,097
[GAUCHE] I only get
to see her once a month.

170
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,640
As long as you look
and sound convincing,

171
00:08:45,724 --> 00:08:47,267
it should tide me over.

172
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:49,269
Uh. Sure. You got it.

173
00:08:49,352 --> 00:08:51,062
Good. This way.

174
00:08:52,689 --> 00:08:55,442
[GAUCHE] You just wanna
be okay with being seen?

175
00:08:55,525 --> 00:08:56,401
[GREY]
Yeah.

176
00:08:56,484 --> 00:08:58,111
[GAUCHE]
All right, change back.

177
00:09:01,865 --> 00:09:05,410
[whimpering]

178
00:09:08,496 --> 00:09:10,040
How is this helping?

179
00:09:10,123 --> 00:09:12,500
I'm being scrutinized
from every side!

180
00:09:12,584 --> 00:09:13,960
[GAUCHE]
Try to push through it.

181
00:09:14,044 --> 00:09:17,172
Right. I can just transform
inside my mind again!

182
00:09:17,255 --> 00:09:19,341
Yeah! I'll be Asta!

183
00:09:20,425 --> 00:09:23,261
Hey, Gauche! Nice weather
we're having lately.

184
00:09:23,345 --> 00:09:26,389
Oh, no!

185
00:09:26,473 --> 00:09:28,266
[GAUCHE]
It's no use.

186
00:09:30,226 --> 00:09:32,228
[GAUCHE]
Stand up and open your eyes.

187
00:09:32,312 --> 00:09:34,272
[GREY]
Mm-mm.

188
00:09:34,356 --> 00:09:36,816
[GAUCHE]
Relax. I'm not looking anymore.

189
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,151
Huh?

190
00:09:42,614 --> 00:09:45,116
Okay. Now what to do?

191
00:09:51,915 --> 00:09:53,500
[gasps]

192
00:09:58,421 --> 00:09:59,923
[GAUCHE]
That's convenient.

193
00:10:00,006 --> 00:10:03,385
Hey, Grey. Can you
hear my voice?

194
00:10:03,468 --> 00:10:05,887
Stand up.

195
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:07,931
Raise your right hand.

196
00:10:09,516 --> 00:10:11,935
[GAUCHE] Great, now
lift up your left leg.

197
00:10:13,353 --> 00:10:16,064
[GAUCHE] She fell into a trance
when she saw that butterfly.

198
00:10:16,147 --> 00:10:17,607
This just might work!

199
00:10:17,691 --> 00:10:21,444
Hm, what's the most relaxed
thing I can think of?

200
00:10:21,528 --> 00:10:25,115
A turtle. From now on,
you're a turtle!

201
00:10:25,198 --> 00:10:26,866
A big, sluggish turtle!

202
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:30,120
You don't worry about anything--
not the wind, the rain,

203
00:10:30,203 --> 00:10:33,248
or what anybody thinks!
You don't care at all!

204
00:10:39,254 --> 00:10:42,674
I can see you.
Are you scared?

205
00:10:43,842 --> 00:10:46,344
All right! It worked!

206
00:10:46,428 --> 00:10:48,555
Hello? Say something!

207
00:10:49,681 --> 00:10:52,475
[GAUCHE] Oh, yeah.
I forgot, turtles don't talk.

208
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:54,436
That's not good.

209
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:56,730
Actually, turn back
into a human,

210
00:10:56,813 --> 00:10:58,565
but keep the turtle mindset.

211
00:10:58,648 --> 00:11:02,068
Just go with the flow and
stop getting embarrassed!

212
00:11:02,152 --> 00:11:05,655
I'm a human. Got it.

213
00:11:05,739 --> 00:11:07,532
[GAUCHE]
I'm looking at you.

214
00:11:12,537 --> 00:11:15,331
I don't feel like
hiding my face anymore.

215
00:11:15,415 --> 00:11:17,584
I'm not afraid!

216
00:11:17,667 --> 00:11:19,085
That's great news!

217
00:11:22,922 --> 00:11:24,132
[GAUCHE]
You good?

218
00:11:24,215 --> 00:11:26,343
[GREY] Well, I'm still
a little anxious,

219
00:11:26,426 --> 00:11:29,095
but I feel like I'm
a different person now.

220
00:11:29,179 --> 00:11:30,722
It's weird.

221
00:11:30,805 --> 00:11:32,390
That makes sense, seeing as how

222
00:11:32,474 --> 00:11:34,559
I've given you
the mind of a turtle.

223
00:11:34,642 --> 00:11:37,979
Pretty soon, you won't care
one bit if people look at you.

224
00:11:38,063 --> 00:11:39,314
Yeah.

225
00:11:39,397 --> 00:11:41,316
[GAUCHE] If you can handle
this crowded street,

226
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:42,650
then you shouldn't
have any problem

227
00:11:42,734 --> 00:11:45,570
being around our squadmates
back at the hideout.

228
00:11:45,653 --> 00:11:48,865
I'm so glad I asked you.
Thank you, Gauche!

229
00:11:48,948 --> 00:11:50,825
[GAUCHE]
Now, then.

230
00:11:50,909 --> 00:11:52,118
Huh?

231
00:11:52,202 --> 00:11:54,454
Time to hold up your
end of the bargain.

232
00:11:54,537 --> 00:11:55,997
Uh...

233
00:11:56,081 --> 00:11:58,083
Don't tell me you
forgot, turtle-brain!

234
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:00,960
Transform into Marie and say
those lines I wrote for you.

235
00:12:01,044 --> 00:12:02,253
Right.

236
00:12:03,588 --> 00:12:04,839
I love you so much!

237
00:12:04,923 --> 00:12:06,758
And I love you, too, Marie!

238
00:12:06,841 --> 00:12:08,134
[screams]

239
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:11,888
Why'd you change?

240
00:12:11,971 --> 00:12:12,931
Well, I'm sorry,

241
00:12:13,014 --> 00:12:15,392
but that was a
little overwhelming.

242
00:12:15,475 --> 00:12:16,893
You said you'd do it.

243
00:12:16,976 --> 00:12:18,520
But, it's way too embarrassing.

244
00:12:18,603 --> 00:12:19,771
[GAUCHE]
You're already back to normal!

245
00:12:19,854 --> 00:12:21,898
[whimpers]

246
00:12:21,981 --> 00:12:25,235
[sighs] That was
a waste of time.

247
00:12:25,318 --> 00:12:27,946
[GREY]
Um. I'm really sorry, Gauche.

248
00:12:28,029 --> 00:12:30,490
[GAUCHE] If it bothers you that
much, then why don't you just

249
00:12:30,573 --> 00:12:34,494
stay in your other form
all the time, like you used to?

250
00:12:34,577 --> 00:12:38,039
[GREY] Because, then
I wouldn't be the real me.

251
00:12:38,123 --> 00:12:39,457
Nah, that's silly.

252
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:43,670
No matter what you look
like, you're still Grey.

253
00:12:43,753 --> 00:12:45,422
Do you mean that?

254
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:09,362
[MAGIC KNIGHTS panting]

255
00:13:09,446 --> 00:13:11,281
[SOL]
Wow, you're amazing, Char!

256
00:13:11,364 --> 00:13:12,741
Now you can activate your spells

257
00:13:12,824 --> 00:13:15,118
even faster than
you could before!

258
00:13:15,201 --> 00:13:17,871
But it's not enough.
We'll need much more.

259
00:13:17,954 --> 00:13:19,914
We can't defeat Spade like this.

260
00:13:19,998 --> 00:13:23,418
And that devil poses
an even more serious threat!

261
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:27,922
Now, then, you five c--!

262
00:13:28,006 --> 00:13:30,133
[MAGIC KNIGHTS panting]

263
00:13:30,216 --> 00:13:33,803
[panting]

264
00:13:33,887 --> 00:13:37,265
[CHARLOTTE] We aren't getting
much done at this point.

265
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:39,768
[CHARLOTTE]
All right. Time for a break.

266
00:13:43,772 --> 00:13:45,523
It sucks not having time off,

267
00:13:45,607 --> 00:13:49,694
but the big battle's coming up,
and we gotta be ready for it!

268
00:13:49,778 --> 00:13:51,738
The kingdom needs
us to protect it,

269
00:13:51,821 --> 00:13:53,573
so I'm honored to fight.

270
00:13:53,656 --> 00:13:57,202
Captain! Feel free
to push us even harder!

271
00:13:57,285 --> 00:13:58,453
I'm planning on it,

272
00:13:58,536 --> 00:14:00,830
but try not to
injure yourselves.

273
00:14:00,914 --> 00:14:02,207
[MAGIC KNIGHTS]
Right!

274
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:04,459
[CHARLOTTE] I'm happy
they're so enthusiastic.

275
00:14:04,542 --> 00:14:06,628
It's probably because
I eased the restrictions

276
00:14:06,711 --> 00:14:09,047
on fraternizing with men.

277
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:10,465
Once we take care
of this situation

278
00:14:10,548 --> 00:14:11,883
with the Spade Kingdom,
I'm gonna spend

279
00:14:11,966 --> 00:14:13,551
so much time with my boyfriend!

280
00:14:13,635 --> 00:14:14,886
[gasps]

281
00:14:14,969 --> 00:14:17,222
Yeah, I wanna go on a date
with my guy every day!

282
00:14:17,305 --> 00:14:19,557
That's why we gotta
get stronger, and quick!

283
00:14:19,641 --> 00:14:20,725
No fair!

284
00:14:20,809 --> 00:14:22,185
My boyfriend and I
just called it quits.

285
00:14:22,268 --> 00:14:24,813
What? Which one
of you broke it off?

286
00:14:24,896 --> 00:14:26,815
It was his choice.

287
00:14:26,898 --> 00:14:28,108
That's too bad.

288
00:14:28,191 --> 00:14:30,068
You have both been really
busy lately, though.

289
00:14:30,151 --> 00:14:31,486
I'm so sorry.

290
00:14:31,569 --> 00:14:34,572
But hey, the best thing to do
is get on the rebound!

291
00:14:34,656 --> 00:14:35,865
Oh, yeah! True!

292
00:14:35,949 --> 00:14:37,409
Come out drinking with us
and I'll set you up

293
00:14:37,492 --> 00:14:39,327
with one of my boyfriend's pals!

294
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:41,121
[CHARLOTTE]
Well, regardless of the motive,

295
00:14:41,204 --> 00:14:43,415
I do appreciate their gusto.

296
00:14:43,498 --> 00:14:45,750
I'll have to guide
them carefully.

297
00:14:45,834 --> 00:14:47,460
Come on, you guys
are getting all giddy

298
00:14:47,544 --> 00:14:49,587
about romance again? Seriously?

299
00:14:49,671 --> 00:14:52,257
What's so exciting
about men, anyway?

300
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,925
Don't forget Captain Charlotte.

301
00:14:54,009 --> 00:14:56,761
Maybe she'll go on
a date with Captain Yami!

302
00:14:57,762 --> 00:14:59,514
[SELENA]
Is everything okay, ma'am?

303
00:14:59,597 --> 00:15:01,766
Uh, yes. I'm all right.

304
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:03,143
Speaking of which,
have there been

305
00:15:03,226 --> 00:15:05,645
any developments
between you two?

306
00:15:05,729 --> 00:15:07,480
I don't understand
what you mean.

307
00:15:07,564 --> 00:15:09,649
Your sweet, budding
romance with the hunkster

308
00:15:09,733 --> 00:15:12,027
who heads up the
Black Bulls, obviously!

309
00:15:13,236 --> 00:15:14,612
Did you guys go
on any more dates

310
00:15:14,696 --> 00:15:16,906
after you had such a
good time at the mixer?

311
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:18,491
[CHARLOTTE]
The mixer!

312
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,537
[screams]

313
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:25,040
That was a wonderful
night, wasn't it?

314
00:15:25,123 --> 00:15:27,500
Just one more push, and he
would've been all hers!

315
00:15:27,584 --> 00:15:29,127
Absolutely ridiculous!

316
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:30,295
Not at all, ma'am!

317
00:15:30,378 --> 00:15:31,880
You were headed
in the right direction!

318
00:15:31,963 --> 00:15:33,298

Are you guys
together yet or what?

Of course we're not, drop it!

What?

[CHARLOTTE]
Though, if I'm being honest...

328
00:15:49,856 --> 00:15:51,775
After the last
captains' meeting,

This is the best
moment to strike!

Think about it,
everybody's on edge

because of the fight with Spade.

Which is why all of us could use

I know I said that I was itching
to go on a lot of dates,

but the truth is,
I already do that now.

[CHARLOTTE] I wonder
what they're discussing.

Perhaps they're devising a
strategy for a combined attack.

Excuse me, Captain,
but we have a proposition.

Go ahead.

We're sad to admit
this, but we don't

feel like we're worthy

[MAGIC KNIGHT 126C] It's okay,
Captain, you can be honest.

against our whole squad,

Jeez, stop being so
pathetic in front of Char!

But she's telling the truth.

421
00:19:36,124 --> 00:19:37,751
That's why we thought
it might be more helpful

422

if we were to train with
a different squad instead.

A different squad?

424

Exactly, we should pair up
with Magic Knights

who are on the same
level as we are,

They seem to have
a decent mix of the best

and the worst, so I feel
like our capabilities

477
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:54,262
[JULIUS] We know the citizens
are still terribly exhausted

478
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:56,931
from the Eye of the
Midnight Sun's invasion.

479
00:21:57,015 --> 00:21:58,975
[MARX]
There's no denying that.

480
00:21:59,059 --> 00:22:00,226
Surely, they must be worried

481
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:03,355
about whether the royal
family can protect them.

482
00:22:03,438 --> 00:22:05,273
It's imperative we restore
the public's faith

483
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:06,733
in the Magic Knights
so that everyone

484
00:22:06,816 --> 00:22:09,986
feels safe and secure again,
while also improving

485
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:12,113
the morale among the squads.

486
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:14,324
If we can do that, then we'll
be much better prepared

487
00:22:14,407 --> 00:22:17,285
to face Spade and
triumph over the devil.

488
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:20,288
Sorry. What exactly are
you suggesting, sir?

489
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:22,540
[laughs]

490
00:22:22,624 --> 00:22:25,585
I'm going to have the
captains battle each other.

491
00:23:57,093 --> 00:23:59,346
[GAUCHE]
<i>Black Clover</i> , Page 151:

492
00:23:59,429 --> 00:24:01,723
"Clash! The Battle of the
Magic Knights Squad Captains!"

493
00:24:01,806 --> 00:24:04,142
[GREY] Um. Do your best
out there, Captain Yami!

494
00:24:04,225 --> 00:24:05,977
[GAUCHE] He'll be fine.
Wanna train again?

495
00:24:06,061 --> 00:24:06,978
[GREY]
No!

496
00:24:07,062 --> 00:24:08,229
[GAUCHE]
All right, all right.

497
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:09,189
[GREY]
I'm ready to learn!

498
00:24:09,272 --> 00:24:10,523
[GAUCHE]
Which is it?
