1
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:15,625
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:18,541
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:24,416
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,083
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:35,541
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:39,791
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:43,416
[NARRATOR]
On orders from the Wizard King,

8
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,333
Asta and his fellow Black Bulls
headed for the seaside village

9
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:50,250
of Raquey and the Underwater
Temple that lay off its coast.

10
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:54,708
[NARRATOR] Their mission: to
enter the well-guarded temple,

11
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:57,166
secure its magic stone,
and prevent the

12
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:00,250
Eye of the Midnight Sun from
fulfilling their ambition

13
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:03,791
to topple the Clover Kingdom
and establish a sovereign state.

14
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:05,208
However...

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,250
What're you messin' around for?

16
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:12,583
Like you're not.

17
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:15,291
Oh, hi, Captain Yami.

18
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:18,708
Okay, you incompetent
knuckleheads, listen up.

19
00:01:18,791 --> 00:01:21,041
Apparently, the Underwater
Temple is beneath

20
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:23,583
the surface of the
ocean around here.

21
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,875
Unfortunately, the
mana-driven currents

22
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:28,541
are too strong,
so even a skilled mage

23
00:01:28,625 --> 00:01:30,750
can't normally get near it.

24
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:33,625
The only time the mana is
weak enough to even possibly

25
00:01:33,708 --> 00:01:36,541
access it is during a full moon.

26
00:01:36,625 --> 00:01:38,791
If ya didn't guess already,
the Underwater Temple

27
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:43,041
is on the ocean floor.
You need magic to get there.

28
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:44,625
So, Noelle.

29
00:01:44,708 --> 00:01:47,208
That's where your
Water Magic comes in.

30
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:48,916
We're gonna hitch a ride on it.

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,208
[NOELLE]
But, sir.

32
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:52,625
I'd need exceptional
control over my magic

33
00:01:52,708 --> 00:01:54,500
to manage something like that.

34
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:56,291
No, I can't do it!

35
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:58,250
You have to, Noelle.

36
00:01:58,333 --> 00:02:00,166
The full moon's a week away.

37
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:03,375
You've got till then to learn
to control your magic.

38
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:05,500
Push past your limits.

39
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:45,833
[MARX] And where do you
think you're going?

40
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,000
Oh, nowhere.

41
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:50,833
I just thought the place could
use a little airing out, is all.

42
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:53,375
Of course, sir. Though...

43
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:54,375
Your foot?

44
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:55,791
[JULIUS]
Well, what do you know?

45
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:57,833
How did that get there? Feet!

46
00:03:57,916 --> 00:03:59,041
They never listen.

47
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:00,791
[MARX] You were about
to abandon your work

48
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,166
and go goof off.

49
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,541
Me? But I would never do
something so irresponsible.

50
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,500
Just taking a
quick magic stroll.

51
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:09,958
[MARX] This is not the time
for your shenanigans!

52
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,125
Now, will you please
do your work, sir?

53
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:13,708
And close that window!

54
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:15,625
[JULIUS]
Fine.

55
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:17,666
Really, all the trouble
the Eye of the Midnight Sun

56
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,708
has been giving us lately,

57
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,875
and you still insist
on slacking off.

58
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:22,625
If you keep getting
worked up like that,

59
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:24,666
you're going to send yourself
to an early grave.

60
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,375
[MARX]
And I'll have you to thank!

61
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,166
Speaking of the Midnight Sun.

62
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,958
I wonder how Yami and
his crew are coming along.

63
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:34,750
[MARX] I only hope they've
gotten down to business.

64
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:38,500
The Underwater Temple.
I wish I could've gone.

65
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:39,875
[MARX sighs]

66
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:41,958
[FINRAL] Please, tell
me more, sweetheart!

67
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:44,166
[MAGNA, LUCK shouting, yelling]

68
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,166
"You are the light
of my life, Finral!"

69
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,750
Why, thank you, my dear.

70
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:48,666
[MAGNA]
Damn it! I told you

71
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,166
to stay away from my flan!

72
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,541
[laughs] Sorry!

73
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,791
I wrote my name on it
and everything!

74
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:57,250
Yeah.

75
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:58,625
But food that's not yours
just tastes better, ya know?

76
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:01,291
[MAGNA]
My flan!

77
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:03,541
Sweet dreams, my
beautiful little angel.

00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:06,875
[CHARMY]
Munch, munch, munch...

79
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,375
Need more!

00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:12,750
Jackasses! Quit screwin' around!

81
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:14,541
We're not on vacation, you know!

82
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:17,750
Now sit down and shut up!
I'm tryin' to concentrate here!

83
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:20,250
[BLACK BULLS]
Sorry, Captain Yami!

84
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:25,333
[KAHONO singing]

85
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:37,583
[NOELLE]
What a beautiful voice.

86
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:40,208
Almost like something
out of a dream.

87
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:42,291
Is she from Raquey?

88
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:43,958
Are these magical bubbles?

89
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:47,083
Is that the spirit of the sea?

90
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:49,416
[gasps]

91
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,958
Ah! Were you listening?

92
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:53,125
Oh, my gosh!

93
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:55,708
[ASTA, NOELLE]
Not what I was expecting.

94
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:58,666
[KAHONO]
Well, nothin' I can do about it.

95
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,000
Wanna be friends?

♪ Do, do, do, do, do... ♪

97

[ASTA, NOELLE]
She wants to be friends?

98
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,500
All right, I guess I
should introduce myself.

99
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,375
I'm Kahono, and you?

100
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:09,625
My name's Noelle,

101
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:11,625
and this guy is Dorksta
the Musclehead.

102
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:14,250
That's not my name,
and I'm not a musclehead!

103
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:17,625
[KAHONO] Huh. Noelle and
Dorksta the Musclehead.

104
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:19,500
You have such strange names.

105
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:21,666
Wait, you believe her?
Aw, come on!

106
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,666
Huh?

107
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,208
She's obviously
making fun of me.

108
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:26,250
My real name's actually Asta!

109
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:28,750
Okay! It's nice
to meet you, Asta.

110
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:31,666
So, Kahono, what are you
doing out here so late?

111
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:32,666
Just singing.

112
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,166
Yeah, I gathered that much.

113
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,375
This is the perfect place
for voice training.

114
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:40,041
The atmosphere, the acoustics--
I just love singing here!

115
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:41,291
Voice training?

116
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:44,125
That's right! You see,
I have this dream.

117
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:47,250
Between my singing, dancing,
and spellcasting...

118
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:50,583
I'm gonna become an idol!

119
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:51,875
[BOTH]
Uh, what's an idol?

120
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:54,958
[KAHONO]
What?! You're joking, right?

121
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,458
[ASTA, NOELLE]
No, sorry.

122
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,541
But they're all the rage in
the Common and Noble Realms.

123
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:01,125
Ah! C'mon, you know, idols!

124
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:02,500
[ASTA, NOELLE]
Uh...

125
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,250
[KAHONO] Okay, so idols are
people who are so good

126
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,916
at singing, dancing,
and using magic

127
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,958
that everyone everywhere
knows who they are.

128
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:09,875
Well, except you, I guess.

129
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:11,291
[ASTA, NOELLE]
Huh.

130
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:12,625
[KAHONO] I'm gonna work and
work and work and work

131
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:15,791
until I make it big as an
idol and get crazy rich!

132
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:17,458
That's the reason
you're doing it?

133
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:19,708
I don't see what's
so great about money.

134
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,666
I mean, it just gets in the way.

135
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,125
You're wrong there.

136
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:25,083
You royals are basically
rolling in the stuff,

137
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:28,208
so you probably can't
understand this, but money,

138
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:29,625
it's a big deal.

139
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:32,125
I mean, without it, you
can't buy pop-potatoes.

140
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:33,875
If you don't have
any pop-potatoes,

141
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,666
just eat steak instead.

[ASTA]
Royalty!

00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:41,166
There, you see! Money
is totally important!

00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,583
Wow, Dorksta, I feel
like you really get me!

145
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,458
Please don't use
that dumb nickname!

Sorry, Dorksta!

Okay, right. Sorry, I--hold on.

[NOELLE]
Hm?

be weakened, Dorksta.

She's good!

164
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:27,083
It takes an incredibly
delicate touch to direct magic

00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,333

I dunno.

That's awesome!

I was sore all over, and now
I don't hurt anywhere!

My body feels so light!
Bye-bye muscle fatigue!

You're amazing, Kahono!

It's like I have
a whole new body!

176

Song Recovery Magic before.

00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:55,041

00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:02,333
But not really.

Are you serious?!

Wow, both of you?

That's crazy, so am I!

Oh, really?

201
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,000
Well, now we definitely
have to be friends.

Sure, sounds great.
You're pretty funny, too.

203
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:43,125
[NOELLE] A friend who's
a girl my own age?

204
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,666
That's new.

205
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,000
Fine.

206
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,041
If you insist, I suppose
that would be acceptable.

207
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:51,000
I mean, I won't not
be your friend.

Yay!

The Magic Knights are amazing!

215
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:13,833
[NOELLE]
It's not a big deal.

216
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:17,666
It stands to reason that I
would be one. I am royalty.

217
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,875
[ASTA]
I'm a commoner, though.

218
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:23,708
Okay, so, what brings
you here? Vacation?

219
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:26,041
Nah. Actually, we've got
an important mission

220
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:26,958
at the Underwater Temple--

Shut up, Asta!

[NOELLE] Please don't listen
to him. It's top-secret, so...

00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:34,208
[KAHONO]
Hm. Okay, whatever.

225

So, you two are
out here pretty late.

Were you...?

What are you talking about?

As if we would ever!

231
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:46,166
The moonlight is so
terribly romantic, though.

232
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:49,500
And the sound of the waves
is perfect mood music!

233
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:50,625
No! I'm telling you,

234
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:51,875
whatever you may
have been thinking,

235
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:53,708
it isn't like that at all, okay?

00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:55,375
I'm out here training.

237
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:56,708
Like, with magic?

238
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:59,625
Yes, with magic, and I
have a lot of work to do.

239
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:01,916
I can't go into detail,
but I need find a way

240
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,166
to control my magic in a week,
before the full moon.

241

If I don't, then our mission...

Right, I get the jist.

243
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:14,083
Let's see. A control issue.
Very interesting.

244
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,708
Well, go on, Noelle,
show me what you can do.

245
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:18,083
Huh?

[KAHONO] Hm, yes, I see.
Nice job, Noelle.

250
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:43,833
Now, as your new friend,

251
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:46,125
I have a little piece
of advice for you.

252
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:48,333
I think you might be having
trouble with control

253
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:51,541
because you're trying too
hard to hold back your mana.

254
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:55,416
Stand still and listen a sec.

255
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,375
[waves rolling]

256
00:12:58,458 --> 00:12:59,875
Hear them?

257
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:01,916
I relax by listening to the
sound of the waves and then

258
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,083
try to cast my spells
without letting myself

259
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:06,916
get too caught up in my own
thoughts and feelings.

260
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,041
Just like that?

261
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:10,750
I'm not a philosopher
or anything,

262
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,333
but I've always thought
that the best way

263
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:15,416
to focus was to have a serene
mind and a peaceful heart.

264
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,541
A serene mind? I'm not
sure I understand.

265
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:19,875
I do!

266
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:22,083
I always feel like
I do my best fighting

267
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:24,041
when my mind's clear and I'm
not thinking about anything.

268
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,208
[NOELLE] Oh, yeah, and what
would you know about it?

269
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:29,250
You don't even use magic,
and you're always not thinking.

270
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:31,041
Try to focus on
your fondest memory,

271
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:33,500
something comforting. Y'know?

272
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:34,958
Um, okay.

273
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:36,250
I'll try.

274
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:37,500
[KAHONO]
It's not that hard.

275
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,333
What about your family?

276
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:41,208

great enough already.

Why wasn't it you who died
instead of our mother?

This is it. Tonight's
my last chance.

327
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:25,166
Hey, Noelle! Don't give up.
You can do this!

328
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,833
[NOELLE]
I'm running out of time,

329
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:29,583
and I still have no
semblance of control.

330
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:31,875
At this rate, our mission...

331
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:34,583
[ASTA]
I just had a great idea!

332
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:35,541
You did?

333
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:36,583
Listen!

334
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:38,541
Stop thinking about
control so much

335
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:40,583
and just let your
magic run wild!

336
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,583
[NOELLE]
Huh?

337
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,083
I've been thinking
about something.

338
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:45,708
That thing you did the first
time your magic went crazy

339
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:48,416
might be exactly what we need.

340
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,541
[NOELLE]
Uh--

341
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:51,500
It's like Kahono
said before, right?

342
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:54,041
You're trying too hard
to hold the mana back!

343
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:55,833
If you relax and
let it do its thing,

344
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,666
maybe the spell
will actually work.

345
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,583
No! That's just insane!

346
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:00,541
If it doesn't work, then--

347
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:01,708
It's fine!

348
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:04,000
I'll use my sword to
keep everyone safe.

349
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:06,375
So quit worryin' and go for it!

350
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:09,458
All right, but if
this goes wrong,

351
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:11,791
you better not
come crying to me!

352
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:20,541
[NOELLE]
Okay. I'm letting it go!

353
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:27,666
That's incredible!

354
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:37,083
[NOELLE] I knew it.
This isn't working at all!

355
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:40,458
I'm nowhere close to
having a serene mind.

359
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:56,541
[NOELLE] I guess it's true.
I really am hopeless. A failure.

360
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:59,083
How am I supposed to
focus on a fond memory

361
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,000

you doing up there,

366
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,666
Lil' Miss Royalty?

367
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,458
Is that really the best a
Black Bull knight can do, huh?

368
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:14,166
You're wasting all
that super-strong

369
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,750
magic power of yours.

370
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:18,625
The sooner you can control it,
the sooner we can spar together!

371
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:20,541
It's not like you'll
die if you mess up,

372
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:22,041
so just relax, and next time

373
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,708
have a little drink
to settle your nerves.

374
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,458
You've gotta be hungry
after all that work,

375
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:28,916
so hurry up and finish before
I eat everything myself!

376
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,750
Don't worry, if you
fall I'll be waiting

377
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:32,083
right here to catch you.

378
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:34,083
Fall and I'll kick
you right back up.

379
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:35,541
So make it work.

380
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:38,625
Just give it your all!

381
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:41,416
You can do it.
I know you can, Noelle!

I do have fond memories.

little sister, huh?

385
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:02,208
Your brother was
talkin' about you.

386
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:03,750
Apparently, you're
a total failure

who can't even
control her magic.

entrance exam even if you tried.

Ya know, I've never seen
a royal failure before.

years with my family,

and I don't have a single
good memory to show for it.

The Black Bulls accepted me.

403

They relied on me. And now...
