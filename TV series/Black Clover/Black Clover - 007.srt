1
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:15,666
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,458
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:24,375
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:26,958
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,500
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:39,666
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:42,458
[MAGNA]
Here ya go!

8
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:43,583
[gasps]

9
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:46,208
You earned this
fair and square, Asta.

10
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:01,916
What, you don't want it?

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,375
[ASTA]
No! I do! I do! I do!

12
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:07,375
[ASTA]
This is really mine.

13
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:11,291
Well, what are you waiting for?

14
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:12,958
Let's see how it looks.

15
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:22,041
And now, the finishing touch.

16
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:37,625
Hey! It looks
pretty good on you.

17
00:01:37,708 --> 00:01:39,500
Right, Yami?

18
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:42,125
I don't think it's his color.

19
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:45,208
It's official now:
you're one of us.

20
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:48,083
You're a member
of the Black Bulls.

21
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:49,875
Don't do anything
that would bring shame

22
00:01:49,958 --> 00:01:52,833
to Yami or to the Black Bulls.

23
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:55,708
[ASTA]
Understood!

24
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:58,625
I'm so glad to be
a part of this team!

25
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:07,416
Yeah!

26
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,916
[ASTA laughs]

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Shut up, kid.

28
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:11,375
[ASTA]
I'm sorry!

29
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:13,375
I'll be more careful
from now on, sir!

30
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:18,000
[MAGNA] What part of "shut up"
do you not understand?

31
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:21,166
[NOELLE] So, I guess that's
the other new recruit.

32
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:26,833
[sighs] Little insect.

33
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:07,166
[MAGNA]
Here it is: your room.

34
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,583
Dank, huh?

35
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:11,125
Not to mention oppressively
cramped and filthy.

36
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:13,375
[laughs]

37
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:14,541
[MAGNA]
You should see mine.

38
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:16,500
--It's twice this siz--
--[ASTA whimpers]

39
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:18,666
My room! No way!

40
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,166
Wait, you're actually happy?

41
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,791
This is the first time I've
ever had a space of my own.

42
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:25,541
Back at the church, everybody
crammed into one room.

43
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,708
We were all lined
up like sardines.

44
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:30,666
[ASTA]
So long, dust!

45
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,916
Dirt and grime, get outta here!

46
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,583
[ASTA laughs]
See ya, cobwebs!

47
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:37,625
[MAGNA]
Go on, scrub all ya want.

48
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:39,833
We're free till the
next mission, anyway.

49
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:41,333
[laughs]

50
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:43,375
Oh, hey, one more thing, Asta.

51
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:44,625
Yeah, what's up?

52
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:47,250
Make sure you take
some time to write.

53
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:50,333
The folks back at the
church deserve a letter.

54
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,166
They're your family, right?

55
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,791
So, they'll wanna know
that you're okay.

56
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:56,125
Right!

57
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,291
[MAGNA] You can't go
making anyone worry.

58
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:02,666
That's what bein' a real
man is all about. Later.

59
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,041
Just hit me up
if you need anything.

60
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:07,083
Will do! Thanks, Magna.

61
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:16,500
[ASTA] This is my first
castle, but not my last.

62
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:20,625
Someday, I'm gonna live in
the castle of the Wizard King.

63
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:27,666
[ASTA]
I won't lose. Got that, Yuno?

64
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:33,500
It's better than you deserve.

65
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,541
A room like this is wasted
on the likes of you.

66
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:41,000
Now, tomorrow I'll
explain your duties

67
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:43,000
as a Magic Knight.

68
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:45,458
I don't particularly
wish to be your tutor,

69
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:49,291
but since it's on Captain
Vangeance's orders, so be it.

70
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:51,125
Are you listening, boy?

71
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:52,833
My name is Yuno.

72
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:57,208
My name is Yuno, Klaus. Not boy.

73
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:58,125
Enough.

74
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:01,375
Watch your tone. I outrank you.

75
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:03,416
You are to address me as "sir."

76
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,583
[YUNO]
Yes, sir.

77
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:05,875
Better.

78
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:08,375
Don't be late tomorrow,
or I will be displeased.

79
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:34,041
[ARLU, HORO laughing]

80
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,458
Thank you.

81
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:42,791
[gasps]

82
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:52,750
I knew we were right
about you, Yuno!

83
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:54,666
The pride and joy of Hage,

84
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,458
making it into
the Magic Knights!

85
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,083
Not that I'm surprised.

86
00:06:58,166 --> 00:06:59,791
Yuno can do anything!

87
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,208
Yeah, anything!

88
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:03,125
Everyone in the village
will be so excited

89
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:04,083
when they hear.

90
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:06,000
And what does Asta's letter say?

91
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:08,958
Can you even make out that
terrible chicken scratch of his?

92
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:10,958
[NASH] Yeah, he writes
like a five-year-old.

93
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:12,958
So does he say when
he's coming home?

94
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:15,875
When he does get here,
we'll have to cheer him up.

95
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:19,041
Even Asta will have a hard
time bouncing back from this.

96
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:22,333
Maybe a pop-potato party
will lift his spirits.

97
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:25,083
Actually, he says
that he got in.

98
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:27,333
[BOTH]
Huh?

99
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:29,583
--[HORO] What?
--[ARLU] Huh?

100
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:31,291
They both passed.

101
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:33,291
[HIGH PRIEST, REKKA, NASH,
ARLU, HORO] What?!

102
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,541
[BOTH]
Seriously?

103
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:36,833
[LILY]
Mm-hm.

104
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:38,166
Oh, wow.

105
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,958
You're not kidding, are you?

106
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:41,791
Really? He did it.

107
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,958
So, um. I guess, then...

108
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:47,083
Asta won't be
coming home, will he?

109
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,416
Right.

110
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,750
We'll go let everyone know
about our Magic Knights.

111
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:52,125
This will be the best news

112
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:53,708
--Hage Village has ever gotten.
--[ARLU, HORO] Yeah!

113
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:55,041
Amazing!

114
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:57,000
He's gonna be a Magic Knight,
just like he said.

115
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,791
He did it!

116
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:02,208
Asta. Yuno. Good job.

117
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:04,416
Just keep doing your best!

118
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:20,875
So, it's real.
I wasn't dreaming.

119
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:27,666
Right. Yeah!

120
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,916
I'm ready to--

121
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:33,208
Wait a second.

122
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:35,208
I'm pretty sure this column
wasn't here yesterday.

123
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:37,750
[MAGNA]
Hey, newbie! How's it hangin'?

124
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,916
Oh, uh. I'm good, thanks.

125
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,875
Can I ask you, though,
about this column?

126
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,500
Yeah, what about it?

127
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:45,541
Well, it's just,

128
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,250
I don't think it
was here yesterday.

129
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:49,416
Probably because it wasn't.

130
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,708
That's nothing, though.

131
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:53,000
This whole building shifts
around all the time.

132
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:54,083
[ASTA]
It does?!

133
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,333
[MAGNA]
Yeah. Eh, you'll get used to it.

134
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:58,750
I thought there was something
weird about this place.

135
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,916
Well, come on. Let's go.

136
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,291
[ASTA]
Sure thing!

137
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,500
You're lucky enough to have
me as your tour guide.

138
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:06,541
There's no one better
to show you all the secrets

139
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:09,125
of the Black Bulls' hideout.

140
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:11,041
Well, Rasta? Ready?

141
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:14,000
Yeah, I'm ready!
Let's go, Mr. Shades.

142
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:16,500
What? No. It's "sir," twerp!

143
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,541
[ASTA]
Right! Got it, Sir Twerp.

144
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,291
[MAGNA]
Drop the "twerp"!

145
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,375
[MAGNA]
This is the dining hall.

146
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:24,958
[ASTA]
Ooh!

147
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:27,416
[MAGNA] Eh? Whatcha think?
Ridiculously huge, huh?

148
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,750
No kidding! It's enormous.

149
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,916
And this is the communal bath.

150
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,291
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

151
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:36,458
It's so hot.

152
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:38,291
I mean, maybe it is
for a normal person,

153
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:41,375
but this heat should be
nothing to a Black Bull.

154
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:43,458
What's wrong? You wanna
get out already?

155
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,041
[ASTA growls]
No, of course not.

156
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:46,875
I can stay in. I'm not done yet.

157
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:48,750
[mumbling] I wouldn't mind
adding a little cold water.

158
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:52,333
It's just really nice to hang
out with you guys like this.

159
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:54,666
[MAGNA] Over there's where
the women's rooms are.

160

If a guy goes in, the

[ASTA]
Uh, what for?

171
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:15,791
It's Yami's little
hobby. And, Asta?

Yeah, what's up?

173
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:21,416
I've decided to put you in

What?

This job is an honor
to have, you know.

I hate to give it up,
but it's yours.

Go on, give it a shot.

[ASTA] A Black Bulls robe.
So that means...

Well, what do you know.

It's your fellow rookie.

She's our other new

[ASTA]
Cool! Another newbie?

Glad to know I'm not alone.

How's it going?

I'm Asta from Hage Village.

Let's give this all
we've got. What do ya say?

Don't speak to me so casually.

206
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:34,041
You're a little insect of a
commoner with barely any mana.

207
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:35,125
"Little insect"?

208
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:37,333
Jeez. "Commoner"?

209
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:41,250
My name is Noelle Silva,
of the royal Silva house.

I, uh...

214
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,500
An insignificant insect like me

215
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:01,541
should never have presumed
to speak so informally

216
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:05,458
to an exalted royal
such as yourself!

217

As long as you understand.

[ASTA] Wait. Who are you
calling a little insect?

219
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:13,791
We joined the Magic Knights
at the same time, didn't we?

Who cares if you're royalty?

Yeah, that's right, Asta.

You tell her! Being royal
doesn't matter here!

223
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,250
It does, very much so.

And what makes you so sure?

I suppose words aren't enough
to make you understand.

227
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,250
The difference in
our magic power

228
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:33,541

you're really royalty?

"Nuh"?

No!

Huh?

--Hey, cool!
--[GORDON] Whatever that thing

339
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:46,666
is, it looks like it's
some serious magic.

340
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,041
That's magic power
gone out of control.

341
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:51,833
And a whole hell
of a lot of it, too.

We're... gonna have
to do something.

[YAMI sighs] Well, attacking
the thing with magic is out.

She's gonna get hurt
if we try that.

345

Why not use your spatial magic
to pull her outta there?

[FINRAL]
Please, be reasonable.

Yeah, okay.

Okay, I'll try.

Wait. How am I supposed
to get up there?

359
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:40,083
I can't exactly fly. So...

Thanks for the portal.

Here it comes, the mocking.

You know...

You've got yourself

I don't have any
magic power, like, none.

All you need is some training
to get it under control.

You were running away

00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:32,375
control your magic power?

You wanna check it out
with me sometime?

I happen to be

at controlling my magic power,
so I can teach you.
