may look like a kid

164
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,125
compared to that Mantis,

165
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:18,625
but he's much more powerful
where it truly counts.

166
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:19,791
[laughs]

167
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,875
[ASTA] Try not to let
anyone else steal this.

168
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:26,625
[OLD WOMAN laughs]
Thank you very much

169
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:29,250
for all your help,
Sir Magic Knight.

170
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,125
See you 'round, Granny.

171
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:32,500
Be careful out there.

172
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:34,375
Stay out of trouble.

173
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,958
Thank you again, Magic Knights!

174
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:39,083
[laughs]

175
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:42,000
[OLD WOMAN]
A sword that nullifies spells.

176
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:46,083
In all my life, I've never once
seen magic like that before.

177
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,750
[OLD WOMAN]
Actually, can it even be...

178
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:53,333
[JULIUS]
...considered magic?

179
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:57,583
Yami certainly nabbed himself
an intriguing new member.

180
00:09:57,666 --> 00:10:01,291
This is why my secret
excursions are so necessary.

181
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,875
Finally, there you are!

182
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:04,791
[JULIUS]
Uh-oh.

183
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,583
What are you up to now?

184
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:07,791
Really, sir!

185
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:10,875
[laughs] Well, since you asked.

186
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:13,208
I'm wandering the
castle town in disguise,

187
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,041
hoping to stumble on new magic.

188
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:18,958
But, sir, that's not appropriate
for a man of your position!

189
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:22,291
[JULIUS] Encountering new magic
is a rare and precious thing.

190
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:23,541
[MARX]
Even so!

191
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:25,250
[JULIUS] I never know
what magical mysteries

192
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,625
might be awaiting me.

193
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:29,666
[MARX] Please listen,
you incorrigible magic geek!

194
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,625
Now, Marx. No need
to get so worked up.

195
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:35,500
Oh? Ooh!

196
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:38,583
Is that the fresh face
over in William's squad?

197
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:42,875
Excellent timing.

198
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:45,791
It seems I have yet
another new magic to meet.

199
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:48,625
Don't worry. I won't be long.

200
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:50,791
[MARX]
Don't you dare, sir!

201
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:07,333
[KLAUS] One of the Golden
Dawn's newest members.

202
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,750
Yuno.

203
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:11,208
The gifted youth sought after
by every squad captain

204
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:14,166
at the Magic Knights
Entrance Exam.

205
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:19,291
And the squad's other newcomer,
the royal Mimosa Vermillion.

206
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:22,000
Their first mission:

207
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:25,541
acting as escort for
Salim de Hapshass.

208
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:30,250
[KLAUS] The son of the
noble Congressman Hapshass?

209
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:32,833
And we are to accompany
him to the Heart Kingdom.

210
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:34,541
But why?

211
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:36,708
[WILLIAM] You're familiar
with Congressman Hapshass?

212
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:38,875
[KLAUS]
Only with his name.

213
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:41,916
I've heard he's considered
a bit of an upstart.

214
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,291
It doesn't seem he is
very well thought of.

215
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,291
[WILLIAM] Which gives him
additional reason to worry

216
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:49,541
about bandit attacks on his son,

217
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,875
as the lad sets off to study
abroad in the Heart Kingdom.

218
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:54,166
Wouldn't you think?

219
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,583
Yes, but surely the
Hapshass family has plenty

220
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:59,291
of powerful magic users
in their employ.

221
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,958
[WILLIAM] It seems he'll only
rest easy if his son is guarded

222
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:05,583
by members of a well-known
Magic Knight squad.

223
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:07,125
The congressman
is quite generous

224
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:10,625
in his annual donations to
the Magic Knights' coffers,

225
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:13,666
and serving government
officials is part of our duty.

226
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,958
Any objections?

227
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:17,375
No. None, sir!

228
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:19,583
Carry out any mission
you are given.

229
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:22,875
The good of the Clover Kingdom
must always be our priority.

230
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:25,000
Yes. Of course, sir.

231
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:27,541
[WILLIAM]
Take Mimosa with you, as well.

232
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:32,125
Accompanied by their teacher,
those two should be sufficient.

233
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:34,666
Look after our
fledglings, Klaus.

234
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,166
Dismissed.

235
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:40,291
[KLAUS]
Salim de Hapshass lost to Yuno

236
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,875
in the final portion
of the entrance exam.

237
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:44,791
As a result, he wasn't
offered a place

238
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:47,166
on any Magic Knight squad.

239
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,208
What reason could he
have for choosing Yuno

240
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:51,416
to be his bodyguard?

241
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,541
I'm so excited to be
going on my first mission!

242
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:58,833
Klaus, Yuno. We're in
this together, right?

243
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,541
Right.

244
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:02,125
Hush, Mimosa. Stay sharp.

245
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:03,750
Oh. Yes.

246
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:04,958
You, as well.

247
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:06,833
Of course.

248
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:08,833
[KLAUS]
Cheeky little newcomer.

249
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:14,791
So, Yuno.

250
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:18,125
Tell me, how have you been?

251
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:20,041
I hope you're not
wearing that scary face

252
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:21,583
because of me.

253
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,625
I chose you as my
escort because I wanted

254
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:26,583
the opportunity to
apologize to you.

255
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:29,958
You're hoping to be the
Wizard King one day, yes?

256
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:32,125
I am, but how did you know?

257
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:34,250
All the captains
raised their hands.

258
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:36,208
You could have joined any squad,

259
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:38,958
and you chose to become
a member of the Golden Dawn.

260
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:42,041
I knew then that you
must have ambitions.

261
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:43,958
I've seen how talented you are.

262
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:45,250
Enough successes behind you,

263
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,166
and before long,
you'll be a household name

264
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,458
throughout the kingdom.

265
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:51,208
"Yuno, of the four-leaf
clover grimoire."

266
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:53,625
Sound good?

267
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,666
Your dream of being
the Wizard King--

268
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,166
make it come true.

269
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,791
Someday, I'll be able
to brag to my children

270
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,625
about our first meeting.

271
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:02,875
"Believe it or not, kids,

272
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:05,375
I once fought the Wizard
King," I'll tell them.

273
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:09,875
"Wow, Daddy, really?"
they'll say. "You're amazing!"

274
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,500
We still have some
time before we reach

275
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,083
the Heart Kingdom.

276
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:16,000
If you don't mind, perhaps you
could tell me about yourself.

277
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:18,625
Though if you'd rather not,
that's all right.

278
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:21,250
I'm from a small
village called Hage.

279
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:23,958
[gasps]

280
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:26,541
Yes. I've heard of it before.

281
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:29,416
A commoner village
on the edge of nowhere.

282
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,500
Isn't that where the legend
of the first Wizard King

283
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:35,208
defeating the demon and
saving the world originated?

284
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,083
[YUNO]
It's not just a legend.

285
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:40,208
In fact, the demon's giant
skeleton is still there.

286
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:41,500
[SALIM]
Oh!

287
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:43,208
The village is all I've known.

288
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:47,250
I was abandoned outside
the church when I was a baby.

289
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,875
I've never seen
my parents' faces.

290
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:52,416
I have no idea who they are.

291
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,583
The church was small
and quite poor,

292
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:56,166
but the priest and the
nun who worked there

293
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,791
raised us the best they
could. I'm very grateful.

294
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:00,375
[KLAUS]
Clear so far.

295
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:03,208
Still, there must be someone
in the Hapshass family

296
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:05,000
who can use Movement magic.

297
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:06,458
Why go to all this trouble?

298
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,791
And with us as his only escorts,

299
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,583
if there were a legitimate
threat of bandit attacks,

300
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:14,916
why wouldn't they increase
his security detail?

301
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,750
This mission is one
mystery after another.

302
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:18,916
[rumbling]

303
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,625
[MIMOSA]
Odd.

304
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:22,583
What's going on up there?

305
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,541
Odd, indeed.

306
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:31,916
There's something
so eerie about it.

307
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,583
I'll go take a look.

308
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,291
[KLAUS]
Hey! You can't just--

309
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:39,875
Guard up, Mimosa.

310
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,583
Um, yes, sir.

311
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:47,833

[KLAUS]
Yuno! Defend Salim!

315
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,583
That's the basic plan.

316
