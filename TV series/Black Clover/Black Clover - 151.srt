1
00:00:22,345 --> 00:00:23,888
[NARRATOR]
The Clover Kingdom.

2
00:00:23,972 --> 00:00:26,433
In this place where
magic is everything,

3
00:00:26,516 --> 00:00:29,310
there lives one boy
who was born without it.

4
00:00:29,394 --> 00:00:31,563
His name is Asta.

5
00:00:32,897 --> 00:00:34,315
[NARRATOR]
His strength and determination

6
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,609
helped him become
a Magic Knight.

7
00:00:36,693 --> 00:00:39,320
And despite the many
challenges he faces,

8
00:00:39,404 --> 00:00:43,116
he aims for the top
and refuses to give up!

9
00:00:43,199 --> 00:00:44,784
Rich or poor,

10
00:00:44,868 --> 00:00:46,953
royalty or commoner,

11
00:00:47,037 --> 00:00:49,789
Asta believes anyone can shine.

12
00:00:49,873 --> 00:00:52,876
His mission is to prove
that to the whole world,

13
00:00:52,959 --> 00:00:55,587
and to become the
next Wizard King!

14
00:00:57,422 --> 00:00:59,257
It's imperative we restore
the public's faith

15
00:00:59,341 --> 00:01:01,051
in the Magic Knights
so that everyone feels

16
00:01:01,134 --> 00:01:02,886
safe and secure again,

17
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:06,097
while also improving the
morale among the squads.

18
00:01:06,181 --> 00:01:08,308
If we can do that, then we'll
be much better prepared

19
00:01:08,391 --> 00:01:11,394
to face Spade and
triumph over the devil.

20
00:01:11,478 --> 00:01:14,314
Sorry. What exactly are
you suggesting, sir?

21
00:01:14,397 --> 00:01:19,527
[chuckles] I'm going to have
the captains battle each other.

22
00:01:23,531 --> 00:01:26,659
[KING CLOVER]
Ahem. Folks!

23
00:01:26,743 --> 00:01:29,079
The Magic Knight Squad Captains
are going head-to-head

24
00:01:29,162 --> 00:01:33,500
in a team battle.
And it begins now!

25
00:02:12,163 --> 00:02:14,457
[laughing]

26
00:02:18,545 --> 00:02:19,921
[MAGIC KNIGHT 151A]
Start the fight!

27
00:03:50,553 --> 00:03:53,056
Not to worry,
citizens of Clover!

28
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:55,141
Your beloved king
is going to explain

29
00:03:55,225 --> 00:03:57,936
everything you need to know!

30
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:00,146
The fight will last
for half an hour!

31
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:03,024
During that time, whichever
team manages to destroy

32
00:04:03,108 --> 00:04:05,568
the other team's crystal
while protecting their own

33
00:04:05,652 --> 00:04:08,488
will be recognized
as the winners!

34
00:04:09,864 --> 00:04:12,742
[KING CLOVER] Also, the match
will be broadcast kingdom-wide

35
00:04:12,826 --> 00:04:15,495
so that everyone may witness it!

36
00:04:17,497 --> 00:04:18,790
[KING CLOVER]
This is your chance to marvel

37
00:04:18,873 --> 00:04:21,126
at the amazing skills
of these great mages,

38
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:24,170
whom I personally spilled blood,
sweat, and tears to train!

39
00:04:24,254 --> 00:04:26,840
So, you're welcome!

40
00:04:26,923 --> 00:04:30,218
By the way, due to
unforeseen circumstances,

41
00:04:30,301 --> 00:04:33,179
Captain Rill Boismortier
of the Aqua Deer

42
00:04:33,263 --> 00:04:35,974
will not be participating today!

43
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,603
[sighs]

44
00:04:40,687 --> 00:04:42,147
[WALTER]
Oh, Master Rill!

45
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:45,483
Those melancholy sighs are a
sign that you've fallen in love!

46
00:04:45,567 --> 00:04:47,986
Your first step into adulthood!

47
00:04:50,697 --> 00:04:54,617
[RILL] Miss. I wish I could
figure out who you are,

48
00:04:54,701 --> 00:04:57,328
and where I'm
supposed to find you.

49
00:04:58,329 --> 00:05:00,874
[JULIUS]
Thanks for your help, Marx!

50
00:05:00,957 --> 00:05:03,084
With your Communication Magic,

51
00:05:03,168 --> 00:05:06,921
everyone in the kingdom can
enjoy this historic event!

52
00:05:07,005 --> 00:05:09,841
I'm happy to hear that, sir.

53
00:05:09,924 --> 00:05:13,678
[OWEN clears throat]

54
00:05:13,762 --> 00:05:17,140
[OWEN] How much longer do
I have to wear this disguise?

55
00:05:17,223 --> 00:05:20,602
Aw! Poor Julius! Take it easy!

56
00:05:20,685 --> 00:05:22,354
[KING CLOVER] With the
Wizard King out of commission,

57
00:05:22,437 --> 00:05:26,358
I've got a golden chance to
gain favor with the populace!

58
00:05:26,441 --> 00:05:27,942
[KING CLOVER]
How are you feeling, old friend?

59
00:05:28,026 --> 00:05:30,945
[MARX] Now that I think about
it, we really should come up

60
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:33,907
with a different solution
to that, for Owen's sake.

61
00:05:35,367 --> 00:05:38,453
World Tree Magic:
Magic Tree Descends!

62
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:46,086
I won't let you interfere!

63
00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:48,046
You're leading with that?

64
00:05:50,256 --> 00:05:53,760
[JACK]
Severing Magic: Death Scythe!

65
00:05:56,012 --> 00:05:58,640
[YAMI]
Not too shabby, string bean.

66
00:05:58,723 --> 00:06:01,810
Dark Magic: Dark Cloaked--

67
00:06:02,936 --> 00:06:04,437
[YAMI grunts]

68
00:06:07,315 --> 00:06:08,316
[gasps]

69
00:06:36,261 --> 00:06:37,971
I'll slice you up!

70
00:06:42,058 --> 00:06:43,059
Of course.

71
00:06:43,143 --> 00:06:45,729
I knew this would
be complicated.

72
00:06:45,812 --> 00:06:47,272
As did I.

73
00:06:47,355 --> 00:06:50,984
Well, then, let's
keep to the plan.

74
00:06:51,067 --> 00:06:52,444
Understood.

75
00:06:53,486 --> 00:06:55,572
[CHARLOTTE] We only recently
discussed a joint training

76
00:06:55,655 --> 00:06:59,034
session with the Black Bulls,
and now I have to fight Yami?

77
00:06:59,117 --> 00:07:02,370
No! Don't think about that!
Remain calm! Calm!

78
00:07:02,454 --> 00:07:04,873
Let's do our best!
I'm psyched! You?

79
00:07:04,956 --> 00:07:07,042
I am. Let's fight!

80
00:07:10,211 --> 00:07:11,629
I don't remember the last time

81
00:07:11,713 --> 00:07:13,965
I had this many
targets to cut up!

82
00:07:14,049 --> 00:07:15,633
You're all mine!

83
00:07:15,717 --> 00:07:20,138
[sighs] This guy's like
a kid in a candy shop.

84
00:07:20,221 --> 00:07:21,598
[NOZEL]
Not so fast!

85
00:07:21,681 --> 00:07:24,517
[sighs] Of course the
riffraff barrels right in.

86
00:07:24,601 --> 00:07:25,602
That's all right.

87
00:07:25,685 --> 00:07:28,104
We'll focus on
defending our crystal.

88
00:07:39,866 --> 00:07:41,159
[JACK cackles]

89
00:07:41,242 --> 00:07:44,454
Come out, come out
wherever you are!

90
00:07:44,537 --> 00:07:47,332
[YAMI] Do you even know where
you're going, smart guy?

91
00:07:47,415 --> 00:07:50,418
[JACK] I don't recall
asking your opinion, pal!

92
00:07:55,924 --> 00:07:58,927
[YAMI] Just sayin'. Walkin'
around in the open like this

93
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:01,221
is a pretty good way
to get ambushed.

94
00:08:01,304 --> 00:08:02,263
Keh!

95
00:08:02,347 --> 00:08:04,891
Like I care about
playing it safe!

96
00:08:12,023 --> 00:08:15,652
If you don't wanna get cut up,
you just gotta cut them first!

97
00:08:26,413 --> 00:08:29,749
Mercury Magic: Rain of Silver.

98
00:08:35,171 --> 00:08:36,840
You should know
your meager spells

99
00:08:36,923 --> 00:08:40,343
are nowhere near sufficient to
stop an opponent such as myself!

100
00:08:40,427 --> 00:08:42,595
And <i>you</i> should be well aware...

101
00:08:44,973 --> 00:08:46,725
[NOZEL]
...that whenever I run away,

102
00:08:46,808 --> 00:08:49,269
it's always a tactical retreat!

103
00:08:55,608 --> 00:08:57,485
[FUEGOLEON]
Very well.

104
00:08:57,569 --> 00:08:58,945
Then whatever plan you may have,

105
00:08:59,029 --> 00:09:01,114
it'll burn to ash
along with you!

106
00:09:04,784 --> 00:09:08,955
Sir Nozel. Please
allow me to assist you.

107
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:10,665
[KAISER]
When I fought Sir Fuegoleon,

108
00:09:10,749 --> 00:09:14,669
I was no match for his power,
despite having my Vortex Magic

109
00:09:14,753 --> 00:09:17,172
amplified by elven mana.

110
00:09:17,255 --> 00:09:20,467
This is a chance for me
to redeem myself!

111
00:09:24,596 --> 00:09:27,766
I have a plan.
Just follow my lead.

112
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:34,939
[SEKKE] I'm getting used to
being the king's right-hand man.

113
00:09:35,023 --> 00:09:39,235
The citizens must be clamoring
to learn more about me.

114
00:09:39,319 --> 00:09:41,613
I bet they're like,
"who's that <i>ha</i> -ttie standing

115
00:09:41,696 --> 00:09:46,326
next to His Majesty?"
Ha, ha! It's me.

116
00:09:46,409 --> 00:09:49,162
[KING CLOVER]
Sekke? I hope you know that

117
00:09:49,245 --> 00:09:50,872
if any of the captains
hurl their attacks

118
00:09:50,955 --> 00:09:52,582
in my direction,
you'll be expected

119
00:09:52,665 --> 00:09:54,626
to protect me with
your very life.

120
00:09:54,709 --> 00:09:55,794
Uh?

121
00:09:55,877 --> 00:09:58,380
[SEKKE] Nope, you're
on your own, buddy!

122
00:10:00,507 --> 00:10:02,425
Oh, yeah, real clever
of you, pickin' away

123
00:10:02,509 --> 00:10:04,052
at your opponents
little by little,

124
00:10:04,135 --> 00:10:06,429
always maintaining
a safe distance.

125
00:10:06,513 --> 00:10:08,139
Now, come closer!

126
00:10:10,725 --> 00:10:13,019
[JACK grunting]

127
00:10:18,274 --> 00:10:20,568
Dark Magic: Black Hole!

128
00:10:31,037 --> 00:10:32,330
Interesting.

129
00:10:36,167 --> 00:10:38,378
--[YAMI] Dark Magic:
--[JACK] Severing Magic:

130
00:10:38,461 --> 00:10:42,924
--Dark Cloaked, Lightless Slash!
--Death Scythe, Lunatic Slash!

131
00:10:45,719 --> 00:10:50,682
[NOZEL] Mercury Creation Magic:
Silver Star of Execution!

132
00:10:52,684 --> 00:10:54,019
[YAMI]
Oh, I'm sorry.

133
00:10:54,102 --> 00:10:56,479
We totally just leveled
that forest, didn't we?

134
00:10:56,563 --> 00:10:58,940
Now you've got
nowhere left to hide.

135
00:11:03,194 --> 00:11:04,612
[VANGEANCE]
Quite all right.

136
00:11:06,781 --> 00:11:08,324
[VANGEANCE]
That stunt put a sizable dent

137
00:11:08,408 --> 00:11:10,201
in your magic reserves.

138
00:11:20,086 --> 00:11:21,212
[JACK yells]

139
00:11:28,511 --> 00:11:29,888
Yoo-hoo!

140
00:11:37,896 --> 00:11:39,522
[JACK]
Yami!

141
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,575
[KIRSCH]
How beautiful!

142
00:11:50,658 --> 00:11:52,786
It would appear our brilliant
Captain Dorothy has lured

143
00:11:52,869 --> 00:11:56,414
Yami of the Black Bulls into
her lovely world of dreams!

144
00:11:56,498 --> 00:11:58,333
But, unfortunately,
Communication Magic

145
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:00,919
isn't capable of crossing
over into that realm.

146
00:12:01,002 --> 00:12:02,837
Which means the rest of us
won't be able to bask

147
00:12:02,921 --> 00:12:04,714
in the splendor of
their magnificent battle

148
00:12:04,798 --> 00:12:07,884
until she brings him back.

149
00:12:07,967 --> 00:12:10,387
There's something so
beautiful about a fight

150
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,305
that can't be observed.

151
00:12:14,516 --> 00:12:15,809
[DOROTHY]
I used my Dream Magic

152
00:12:15,892 --> 00:12:18,603
to transport you
to Glamour World!

153
00:12:18,687 --> 00:12:22,565
Might as well relax until
time runs out, Yami dear!

154
00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:23,942
Too bad!

155
00:12:24,025 --> 00:12:26,695
My squad tells me if
you fall asleep in here,

156
00:12:26,778 --> 00:12:30,240
then you won't be able
to go outside ever again.

157
00:12:30,323 --> 00:12:34,077
Oh, and whatever random crap
you imagine becomes real, right?

158
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,912
Exactly!

159
00:12:35,995 --> 00:12:37,330
[YAMI]
Well then...

160
00:12:37,414 --> 00:12:40,583
Onsen! Sushi boat!

161
00:12:40,667 --> 00:12:43,628
And good saké!

162
00:12:46,131 --> 00:12:47,382
[YAMI]
Ugh.

163
00:12:47,465 --> 00:12:50,093
[DOROTHY giggles]

164
00:12:50,176 --> 00:12:52,220
It has to be something
that I'm familiar with,

165
00:12:52,303 --> 00:12:53,471
or it won't work!

166
00:12:53,555 --> 00:12:56,016
Aw, man, I was really
looking forward to that.

167
00:12:56,099 --> 00:12:57,517
Oh, well.

168
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,476
Exit door.

169
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,936
[DOROTHY giggles]

170
00:13:08,611 --> 00:13:10,613
[DOROTHY] That little elf
who was possessing my body

171
00:13:10,697 --> 00:13:13,742
before had a hard time
with specificity.

172
00:13:13,825 --> 00:13:16,327
But I'm not gonna make
the same mistake.

173
00:13:16,411 --> 00:13:18,455
I guess I'll have to
take a direct approach.

174
00:13:18,538 --> 00:13:20,331
It's more my style anyway.

175
00:13:20,415 --> 00:13:23,418
[DOROTHY giggles]
Sounds like a plan!

176
00:13:23,501 --> 00:13:26,588
Okay. How do you like this?

177
00:13:36,556 --> 00:13:37,891
[YAMI]
Now, Dark Cloaked...

178
00:13:37,974 --> 00:13:39,768
Now, Dark Cloaked...

179
00:13:39,851 --> 00:13:41,686
[BOTH]
...Lightless Slash!

180
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,441
Howdy, partner,
it's nice to meet ya!

181
00:13:46,524 --> 00:13:48,735
My name's Yami, and I'm
the rootin'-tootin' captain

182
00:13:48,818 --> 00:13:51,404
of the famous Black Bulls squad!

183
00:13:51,488 --> 00:13:52,655
Is she making fun of me,

184
00:13:52,739 --> 00:13:55,367
or does she really
think I talk like that?

185
00:13:57,285 --> 00:13:59,704
The foreigner's
mana disappeared.

186
00:14:00,955 --> 00:14:03,583
[NOZEL] He must've been
captured by the Dream Magic.

187
00:14:03,667 --> 00:14:05,877
He won't be escaping
for a while.

188
00:14:08,004 --> 00:14:11,299
We need to protect ourselves
from any further setbacks.

189
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:13,551
Let's take care of him, now!

190
00:14:13,635 --> 00:14:15,220
[KAISER]
Leave it to me!

191
00:14:18,723 --> 00:14:20,225
[FUEGOLEON] Normally,
I would have the upper hand

192
00:14:20,308 --> 00:14:24,312
against Mercury Magic, but since
he's constantly using a massive

193
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:27,899
amount of mana, he can
repair the cage instantly.

194
00:14:27,982 --> 00:14:29,150
And I can't touch them

195
00:14:29,234 --> 00:14:34,406
if they're outside
the vortex. Quite clever!

196
00:14:34,489 --> 00:14:35,699
[LEOPOLD]
He's trapped!

197
00:14:35,782 --> 00:14:38,451
Wide-range Mercury
Magic and a vortex!

198
00:14:38,535 --> 00:14:40,412
With sophisticated
technique's like that,

199
00:14:40,495 --> 00:14:43,832
they're formidable opponents
even for Captain Fuegoleon!

200
00:14:43,915 --> 00:14:47,085
Amazing. So this is
how captains fight!

201
00:14:47,168 --> 00:14:48,795
Just wait.

202
00:14:48,878 --> 00:14:51,214
My brother's still
getting warmed up!

203
00:14:53,258 --> 00:14:54,384
[gasps]

204
00:15:02,851 --> 00:15:04,060
What do you think
he's about to do

205
00:15:04,144 --> 00:15:05,979
with all those flames?

206
00:15:06,062 --> 00:15:07,272
[gasps]

207
00:15:08,857 --> 00:15:12,444
[NOZEL] The fire won't reach us,
but the heat will.

208
00:15:12,527 --> 00:15:14,279
What's he plotting?

209
00:15:14,362 --> 00:15:16,573
How hot is the
blast going to be?

210
00:15:16,656 --> 00:15:20,827
[FUEGOLEON yells]

211
00:15:32,922 --> 00:15:35,258
What? Which way did he go?

212
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:48,146
[NOZEL]
He used Salamander as a decoy

213
00:15:48,229 --> 00:15:50,273
so we wouldn't detect his mana.

214
00:15:52,692 --> 00:15:53,818
[JACK yells]

215
00:15:57,238 --> 00:15:58,573
Nice try--

216
00:16:05,163 --> 00:16:07,624
[YAMI]
I'm toast.

217
00:16:07,707 --> 00:16:09,167
See? You shoulda known

218
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:13,171
a copycat could never
outdo the original.

219
00:16:13,254 --> 00:16:14,381
Hate to tell ya,

220
00:16:14,464 --> 00:16:16,633
but you're still within
reach of her spell.

221
00:16:21,721 --> 00:16:23,723
[DOROTHY]
Cool thing about copies is

222
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:26,518
I can just keep creating more!

223
00:16:26,601 --> 00:16:30,563
Hah! Send all the
knockoffs you want to.

224
00:16:33,608 --> 00:16:36,653
Crap, this sucks.

225
00:16:36,736 --> 00:16:40,949
[YAMIS] Now, Dark Cloaked,
Lightless Slash!

226
00:16:55,255 --> 00:16:56,798
How did you?

227
00:16:56,881 --> 00:16:58,091
The signal is a bit faint,

228
00:16:58,174 --> 00:17:00,760
but I'm picking up
on Jack's mana!

229
00:17:02,053 --> 00:17:03,346
[NOZEL]
Things look grim.

230
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:05,640
However, if we can hit
him with one attack,

231
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:08,059
we may still have a
chance of winning this!

232
00:17:11,021 --> 00:17:13,815
I'm surprised you
haven't given up yet.

233
00:17:13,898 --> 00:17:18,737
[NOZEL] Mercury Magic:
Silver Shining Regal Spear!

234
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,655
[yells]

235
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:27,579
[panting]

236
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:35,337
No! I can't hold out
for much longer!

237
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:38,506
[NOZEL] You seemed so
confident before, Jack.

238
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,259
Don't tell me this
is the best you can do!

239
00:17:48,892 --> 00:17:51,770
[JACK panting]

240
00:17:53,188 --> 00:17:55,190
[DOROTHY]
Nice work, Yami dear!

241
00:17:55,273 --> 00:17:57,525
You're tougher than I thought!

242
00:17:57,609 --> 00:18:00,820
Although, I'm sure you're
close to your limit.

243
00:18:00,904 --> 00:18:04,240
[YAMI laughs]
Think so, eh?

244
00:18:04,324 --> 00:18:06,743
Guess you've got a lot
to learn about me, then.

245
00:18:06,826 --> 00:18:08,578
Little Miss Witch.

246
00:18:08,661 --> 00:18:11,414
I'll show you the spell
I used a while back.

247
00:18:11,498 --> 00:18:15,210
A time when I really
pushed past my limits!

248
00:18:15,293 --> 00:18:16,628
Can you move?

249
00:18:16,711 --> 00:18:20,465
Keh! Who do you think
you're talking to, royal boy?

250
00:18:20,548 --> 00:18:23,259
Let's end this fight. Now!

251
00:18:23,343 --> 00:18:26,346
I don't take orders
from snobs like you!

252
00:18:26,429 --> 00:18:28,390
Hold nothing back!

253
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:37,273
[yells]

254
00:18:42,362 --> 00:18:43,571
I don't think so.

255
00:19:02,382 --> 00:19:04,300
As a royal who
guards this kingdom,

256
00:19:04,384 --> 00:19:07,095
and as Captain of
the Silver Eagles,

257
00:19:07,178 --> 00:19:11,808
I refuse to be defeated
in such a pathetic manner!

258
00:19:11,891 --> 00:19:14,853
I'm sure you're watching,
Crimson Lion Kings!

259
00:19:14,936 --> 00:19:16,062
Remember, there is nothing

260
00:19:16,146 --> 00:19:19,774
our passionate flames
cannot incinerate!

261
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:24,571
[CAPTAINS yelling]

262
00:19:24,654 --> 00:19:26,031
Ah!

263
00:19:31,161 --> 00:19:34,039
Since I'm a Squad Captain,
I have to be extra strong!

264
00:19:34,122 --> 00:19:36,291
I wanna become so good
at Dream Magic

265
00:19:36,374 --> 00:19:39,544
that I can even trap
devils in here!

266
00:19:39,627 --> 00:19:41,838
[YAMI] You guys are all
copies of the version of me

267
00:19:41,921 --> 00:19:43,965
that the little witch girl saw.

268
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:48,386
The thing is, I've gotten
better since then!

269
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:54,642
Mana Zone: Dark Cloaked,
Dimension Slash, Equinox!

270
00:20:09,574 --> 00:20:10,617
[JULIUS]
Oh, my!

271
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,911
Talk about a fantastic battle!

272
00:20:12,994 --> 00:20:14,371
I can't believe I got to witness

273
00:20:14,454 --> 00:20:18,208
such an astounding
exchange of magic power!

274
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,835
Especially the grand finale!

275
00:20:22,545 --> 00:20:25,131
[JULIUS] Who could have expected
that Yami's Dimension Slash

276
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:28,968
would cut both teams' crystals
in two at the same time?

277
00:20:29,052 --> 00:20:32,013
You made us go to all that
trouble, and it's a tie?

278
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:35,433
Well, if somebody hadn't spent
the whole battle in la-la land!

279
00:20:35,517 --> 00:20:38,561
I think we can all agree
those two are hopeless.

280
00:20:38,645 --> 00:20:40,605
After such an
exhausting competition,

281
00:20:40,689 --> 00:20:44,776
it's impressive they still
have enough energy to argue.

282
00:20:44,859 --> 00:20:46,027
What a bummer!

283
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:47,987
I was hoping I would get
to be on the broadcast,

284
00:20:48,071 --> 00:20:50,198
but Yami dear had to go
and spend the whole fight

285
00:20:50,281 --> 00:20:51,741
stuck in the Glamour World!

286
00:20:51,825 --> 00:20:54,703
[CHARLOTTE] "Yami dear"?
What happened between those two?

287
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:56,287
I'm still in shock!

288
00:20:56,371 --> 00:20:59,791
You Magic Knight Captains always
find a new way to surprise me!

289
00:20:59,874 --> 00:21:01,459
[MARX] Something
tells me he just wanted

290
00:21:01,543 --> 00:21:03,670
to watch the greats in action.

291
00:21:03,753 --> 00:21:06,256
[JULIUS]
You were amazing, too, Marx!

292
00:21:06,339 --> 00:21:09,050
Thanks to you, the entire Clover
Kingdom was lucky enough

293
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:12,554
to be part of this
unforgettable event!

294
00:21:12,637 --> 00:21:15,306
Not only that, but I bet
it made them feel much safer

295
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:17,517
knowing that a group of
capable mages like you

296
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,977
are protecting them.

297
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,438
And, after seeing all
of you captains--

298
00:21:21,521 --> 00:21:25,275
rather, Grand Magic Knights--
in action, your subordinates

299
00:21:25,358 --> 00:21:29,612
will have an even higher opinion
of you from this day forward.

300
00:21:29,696 --> 00:21:34,826
Every moment brings us closer
to facing Spade and the devil.

301
00:21:34,909 --> 00:21:37,662
I hope today's contest
inspired you and your squads

302
00:21:37,746 --> 00:21:40,498
to reach even greater
heights until then!

303
00:21:42,667 --> 00:21:43,668
[CAPTAINS]
Sir!

304
00:23:19,055 --> 00:23:20,682
[FULL CAST]
Clover Clips!

305
00:23:23,018 --> 00:23:24,811
[CHARLOTTE]
"Yami and Yami."

306
00:23:26,062 --> 00:23:27,522
Pardon me, Yami,
but it seemed like

307
00:23:27,605 --> 00:23:29,816
Dorothy's dream world was giving
you quite a bit of trouble.

308
00:23:29,899 --> 00:23:31,735
What exactly was
going on in there?

309
00:23:31,818 --> 00:23:33,737
Oh, it was a huge pain.

310
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,280
This other version
of me showed up,

311
00:23:35,363 --> 00:23:38,116
and he was pretty
freakin' strong. It sucked!

312
00:23:38,199 --> 00:23:40,243
[CHARLOTTE]
Another version of Yami?

313
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:44,748
[YAMI]
You've got the Sexy Yami.

314
00:23:44,831 --> 00:23:46,750
Or me, the Wild Yami.

315
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:48,543
[BOTH]
