00:00:24,014 --> 00:00:26,433
In this place where
magic is everything,

3
00:00:26,516 --> 00:00:29,394
there lives one boy
who was born without it.

4
00:00:29,477 --> 00:00:31,479
His name is Asta.

5
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:34,357
[NARRATOR]
His strength and determination

6
00:00:34,441 --> 00:00:36,693
helped him become
a Magic Knight.

7
00:00:36,776 --> 00:00:39,362
And despite the many
challenges he faces,

8
00:00:39,446 --> 00:00:43,158
he aims for the top
and refuses to give up!

9
00:00:43,241 --> 00:00:44,868
Rich or poor,

10
00:00:44,951 --> 00:00:46,953
royalty or commoner,

11
00:00:47,037 --> 00:00:49,831
Asta believes anyone can shine.

12
00:00:49,914 --> 00:00:52,917
His mission is to prove
that to the whole world,

13
00:00:53,001 --> 00:00:55,754
and to become the
next Wizard King!

14
00:00:58,256 --> 00:01:00,342
[NARRATOR] In order to
learn the Mana Method

15
00:01:00,425 --> 00:01:02,844
and acquire the power
they'll soon need,

16
00:01:02,927 --> 00:01:05,180
Asta and the others train
as hard as they can

17
00:01:05,263 --> 00:01:07,640
in the Heart Kingdom.

18

[screams]

21
00:01:18,234 --> 00:01:21,404
The power to invalidate magic
is second to nothing.

22
00:01:21,488 --> 00:01:24,741
But you're too narrowminded
to use it to its full potential.

23
00:01:24,824 --> 00:01:26,242
I'm not done!

24
00:01:27,911 --> 00:01:32,332
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, Yami seeks
to improve in his own way.

25
00:01:32,415 --> 00:01:34,000
Looks like they're
all workin' hard

26
00:01:34,084 --> 00:01:36,294
to push past their limits.

27
00:01:36,378 --> 00:01:39,339
So I guess I better
up my game, as well.

[screaming]

32
00:03:39,542 --> 00:03:42,087
[ASTA] I've been sparring
with this guy for days now,

33
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:44,964
and I still can't
get a single hit in!

34
00:03:45,048 --> 00:03:47,342
It's fortunate that
I opted to hold back.

35
00:03:47,425 --> 00:03:51,096
You'd be in far worse
shape if I hadn't.

36
00:03:51,179 --> 00:03:52,764
You've trained to
your physical limit,

37
00:03:52,847 --> 00:03:55,225
obtained the rare power
known as Anti-magic,

38
00:03:55,308 --> 00:03:57,811
and forged friendships
with capable allies.

39
00:03:57,894 --> 00:04:00,271
That's gotten you this far.

40
00:04:00,355 --> 00:04:03,066
However, it won't be enough
to overcome the enemy

41
00:04:03,149 --> 00:04:05,151
that we're about to face.

42

If you can't find
a way to defeat me

43
00:04:07,195 --> 00:04:11,533
in one-on-one combat, you will
fall to the Spade Kingdom Devil.

44
00:04:11,616 --> 00:04:14,494
One more round! Let's go!

45
00:04:14,577 --> 00:04:16,705
[GAJA] Perhaps it's that
unwavering willpower

46
00:04:16,788 --> 00:04:20,542
that's allowed him to become
this strong so quickly.

47
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,961
It isn't just him though.

48
00:04:23,044 --> 00:04:26,006
All of the Clover Kingdom
mages are growing quickly.

49
00:04:26,089 --> 00:04:28,842
Some have already developed
new techniques here.

50
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:39,019
[LEOPOLD]
Faster. I need to be faster.

51
00:04:39,102 --> 00:04:40,979
And stronger, too!

00:04:41,062 --> 00:04:42,981
[LEOPOLD yells]

Hey, Leopold.

54
00:04:47,152 --> 00:04:49,237
[LEOPOLD]
I should be able to do more.

55
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,031
I know I should!

56
00:04:58,788 --> 00:05:00,665
Those were some really
excellent moves.

57
00:05:00,749 --> 00:05:02,000
Good work.

58
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:04,044
Nice use of the
Mana Method, too.

59
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:06,338
You're a lot faster with it now.

60
00:05:06,421 --> 00:05:07,922
That said...

61
00:05:08,006 --> 00:05:10,759
Hm. How to put this?

62
00:05:10,842 --> 00:05:12,844
Every now and again,
you seem to waver a bit

63
00:05:12,927 --> 00:05:15,722
when you're
sparring with me.

64
00:05:15,805 --> 00:05:18,767
It feels like something's
causing you to hesitate.

65
00:05:20,143 --> 00:05:22,687
Do you have any idea
what that might be?

66
00:05:22,771 --> 00:05:24,064
I think I know.

67
00:05:24,147 --> 00:05:26,900
I have an older brother
and sister who I look up to.

68
00:05:26,983 --> 00:05:28,651
Their power is incredible,

69
00:05:28,735 --> 00:05:32,280
and it's been permanently
seared into my eyes.

70
00:05:32,364 --> 00:05:34,157
I can't help but compare
my own achievements

71
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,411
to theirs, and when
I do, I feel pathetic.

72
00:05:38,495 --> 00:05:39,746
[MEREOLEONA]
Stand up.

73
00:05:39,829 --> 00:05:42,415
A lion should never
look so pitiful.

74
00:05:42,499 --> 00:05:44,084
[LEOPOLD]
The stronger I get,

75
00:05:44,167 --> 00:05:46,920
the more out of reach
they seem to become.

76
00:05:47,003 --> 00:05:51,216
It feels like, no matter hard
I try, or how far I get,

77
00:05:51,299 --> 00:05:53,551
they'll always be better.

00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,736
as you know.

00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,489
Did you come for a dip
in the hot springs, too?

86
00:06:14,572 --> 00:06:17,826
Do your part and clear out
some of the locals beforehand.

87
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:20,370
Sheesh. So you killed
those magical beasts

88
00:06:20,453 --> 00:06:22,831
just to make sure they
wouldn't interrupt your bath?

89
00:06:22,914 --> 00:06:26,084
You are every bit as violent
as I remember you bein'.

90
00:06:26,167 --> 00:06:27,794
Not like it was a big chore.

91
00:06:27,877 --> 00:06:30,255
I wouldn't even
call that a warmup.

92
00:06:30,338 --> 00:06:33,550
Of course not.
Tell ya what, though.

93
00:06:33,633 --> 00:06:35,969
If you need a warmup,
you could fight me.

94
00:06:36,052 --> 00:06:37,178
I see.

95
00:06:37,262 --> 00:06:39,639
Did you come all this
way looking for me?

96
00:06:39,723 --> 00:06:42,017
Yeah. I did.

97
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,394
See, when I was fightin'
that word devil,

98
00:06:44,477 --> 00:06:46,771
I was able to use
a technique of yours.

99
00:06:46,855 --> 00:06:49,190
Think you call it "Mana Zone."

100
00:06:49,274 --> 00:06:52,235
But I don't have a good handle
on how it works just yet,

101
00:06:52,318 --> 00:06:55,030
and somethin' tells me I could
get more use out of it if I did,

102
00:06:55,113 --> 00:06:57,198
so I wanna experiment a bit.

103
00:06:57,282 --> 00:07:00,076
Uh-huh. Couldn't you
do that alone?

104
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,454
Well, it's just that
you're so experienced.

105
00:07:02,537 --> 00:07:05,331
I was hopin' you'd be willin'
to show me the ropes.

[MEREOLEONA]
Fine.

107
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:10,211
I was thinking that I should
get some more training in.

108
00:07:10,295 --> 00:07:13,006
But be warned. Against me,

109
00:07:13,089 --> 00:07:17,302
you might just burn before you
even get to try my technique.

110
00:07:17,385 --> 00:07:19,471
Oh, boy. I'm not
sure if she sees

111
00:07:19,554 --> 00:07:22,140
the difference between
teaching me and killing me.

112

Hey, on second thought,

I think I'll just go.

That's prob'ly not
gonna fly, is it?

115
00:07:31,274 --> 00:07:32,484

Or I know enough to come up
with countermeasures, at least.

00:08:40,218 --> 00:08:43,513
Exactly how long do you intend
to struggle against me?

I can't get anywhere
near this guy,

so how am I supposed
to land a hit?

137
00:08:52,981 --> 00:08:54,941
Let's talk about
your Anti-magic.

138
00:08:55,025 --> 00:08:57,318
It's essentially
the opposite of magic,

139
00:08:57,402 --> 00:09:00,363
but opposites tend to
share certain fundamentals.

140
00:09:00,447 --> 00:09:03,241
Both are forms of
intangible power.

141
00:09:03,324 --> 00:09:07,287
This could mean that they
can be wielded in similar ways.

142
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,414
The first step
of the Mana Method

143
00:09:09,497 --> 00:09:11,958
is to feel the mana
flowing around you.

144
00:09:12,042 --> 00:09:15,962
So perhaps you should
try something similar.

145
00:09:16,046 --> 00:09:17,005
[ASTA]
Right.

146
00:09:17,088 --> 00:09:19,883
I need to feel
the flow of Anti-magic!

00:09:38,401 --> 00:09:40,779

able to match her.

[YAMI]
Whelp. This isn't good.

161
00:10:03,551 --> 00:10:05,595
[YAMI]
This place is way too hot.

162
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:07,764
What was I thinkin',
fightin' a Mana Zone expert

163
00:10:07,847 --> 00:10:09,641
in a place like this?

164
00:10:09,724 --> 00:10:12,185
Hey, I thought cats liked
to play with their food.

165
00:10:12,268 --> 00:10:14,020
Slow down, ya furball.

166
00:10:14,104 --> 00:10:17,607
[MEREOLEONA] Hmph! I see no
point in toying with weak prey.

167
00:10:17,691 --> 00:10:19,984
Why don't you try
struggling more?

168
00:10:21,903 --> 00:10:23,988
[yells]

169
00:10:24,072 --> 00:10:27,492
[YAMI] If this was a contest of
speed alone, I'd probably lose.

170
00:10:27,575 --> 00:10:29,536
[YAMI gasps, grunts]

171
00:10:29,619 --> 00:10:31,788
[MEREOLEONA growls]

172
00:10:31,871 --> 00:10:35,125
[YAMI] Dark Magic:
Dark Cloaked, Black Blade!

173
00:10:38,378 --> 00:10:40,296
[ASTA]
Black Divider!

174
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:43,091
[yells]

175
00:10:43,174 --> 00:10:44,592
[ASTA]
He disappeared!

176
00:10:45,635 --> 00:10:48,471
[GAJA] You enlarged your
blade to extend your reach.

177
00:10:48,555 --> 00:10:52,726
Not a bad idea.
But you're still far too slow.

178
00:10:52,809 --> 00:10:56,312
[ASTA] Even if I can sense him
with my ki, I can't keep up.

179
00:10:56,396 --> 00:10:58,940
I'm using the Mana Method
to enhance my speed,

180
00:10:59,024 --> 00:11:01,526
which makes avoiding
you a simple task.

181
00:11:05,947 --> 00:11:07,073
[ASTA screams]

182
00:11:07,157 --> 00:11:09,492
The Heart Kingdom
teems with natural mana,

183
00:11:09,576 --> 00:11:12,203
and the mages here
make regular use of it.

184
00:11:12,287 --> 00:11:15,040
For those of us who
master the Mana Method,

185
00:11:15,123 --> 00:11:17,792
this power source
may as well be unlimited.

186
00:11:19,127 --> 00:11:21,629
Which means that,
as long as I can keep

187
00:11:21,713 --> 00:11:23,214
avoiding your attacks,

188
00:11:23,298 --> 00:11:27,052
I can fight indefinitely without
needing to tap into my own mana.

189
00:11:27,135 --> 00:11:28,470
[ASTA]
I get it.

190
00:11:28,553 --> 00:11:31,014
So if I keep burning
through my Anti-magic,

191
00:11:31,097 --> 00:11:32,640
I'm sure to lose.

192
00:11:35,727 --> 00:11:37,187
[YAMI grunts]

193
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:38,688
[MEREOLEONA]
You call that an attack?

194
00:11:38,772 --> 00:11:39,606
Come on!

195
00:11:39,689 --> 00:11:42,359
[laughs] This is pathetic!

196
00:11:46,905 --> 00:11:49,491
Why wait for the
devil to end you?

197
00:11:49,574 --> 00:11:52,827
I can do your last rites
here and now, if you'd like.

198
00:11:52,911 --> 00:11:54,788
Thing is, I already
owe you so much

199
00:11:54,871 --> 00:11:56,748
for helpin' out
with my training.

200
00:11:56,831 --> 00:11:59,417
So thanks for the offer,
but I'll pass.

201
00:12:03,213 --> 00:12:05,465
Looks like step one is gonna
be figuring out that trick

202
00:12:05,548 --> 00:12:07,258
where she walks on thin air.

203
00:12:07,342 --> 00:12:10,345
Once I've learned that,
I can enter the ring.

204
00:12:10,428 --> 00:12:11,846
[ASTA]
Come on!

205
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:14,015
You need to come up with an
attack that he can't dodge.

206
00:12:14,099 --> 00:12:15,558
Something with the
range to reach him

207
00:12:15,642 --> 00:12:17,560
and the speed to catch him.

208
00:12:17,644 --> 00:12:20,021
I've already seen the powers
of the Demon-Slayer Sword

209
00:12:20,105 --> 00:12:22,399
and the Demon-Destroyer Sword.

210
00:12:22,482 --> 00:12:26,486
I assume that this sword
is unique as well?

211
00:12:26,569 --> 00:12:29,280
[ASTA]
Right. The Demon-Dweller Sword.

212
00:12:29,364 --> 00:12:33,702
It probably has powers
that I haven't drawn out yet.

213
00:12:33,785 --> 00:12:35,245
That reminds me.

214
00:12:35,328 --> 00:12:37,163
Right after I found this sword,

215
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:39,499
I channeled Noelle's
mana with it.

216
00:12:39,582 --> 00:12:41,543
I'm not sure,
but there's a chance

217
00:12:41,626 --> 00:12:44,587
I can do the same thing
with my own Anti-magic.

218
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:48,216
Interesting. I take it
you've had an epiphany?

219
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:50,677
Please let me have another try!

220
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,178
If that's what you want.

221
00:12:52,262 --> 00:12:55,056
I won't hold back
as much this time.

222
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:57,600
If you manage to land
a single hit on me,

223
00:12:57,684 --> 00:12:59,394
then I'll declare
you victorious.

224
00:12:59,477 --> 00:13:02,856
To be honest, I wish
you'd just go all out!

225
00:13:06,526 --> 00:13:09,529
If you won't move,
I'll bring the fight to you.

226
00:13:13,116 --> 00:13:15,243
[YAMI]
'Kay, now kick the air!

227
00:13:15,326 --> 00:13:17,954
[screams]

228
00:13:18,038 --> 00:13:21,166
Just as lions toss their young
off cliffs to test them,

229
00:13:21,249 --> 00:13:24,586
I have absolutely no problem
hurling you into the lava.

230
00:13:24,669 --> 00:13:27,047
[YAMI] Are you really
chasin' me right now?

231
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:31,092
[YAMI] Sucks to admit,
but Sisgoleon's right.

232
00:13:31,176 --> 00:13:33,178
If I let myself lose here...

233
00:13:35,972 --> 00:13:38,808
[YAMI] What chance would
I have against that devil?

234
00:13:38,892 --> 00:13:40,727
Ah. Nice.

235
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:43,730
Looks like I can finally
fight you on equal ground.

236
00:13:43,813 --> 00:13:44,981
"Equal ground"?

237
00:13:45,065 --> 00:13:47,108
We're floating above lava, fool.

238
00:13:47,192 --> 00:13:48,109
[YAMI]
You get the point!

239
00:13:48,193 --> 00:13:50,111
I'm saying it's
an even fight now!

240
00:13:50,195 --> 00:13:52,447
Hah! When it comes to Mana Zone,

241
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:54,657
you're just a baby
learning to walk.

242
00:13:56,534 --> 00:13:57,827
[YAMI] I need to
figure out how to deal

243
00:13:57,911 --> 00:13:59,621
with those fists of hers.

244
00:14:06,127 --> 00:14:07,379
All right, Asta.

245
00:14:07,462 --> 00:14:09,881
It's just like when
you borrowed Noelle's mana.

246
00:14:09,964 --> 00:14:12,050
I just need to infuse
the Demon-Dweller Sword

247
00:14:12,133 --> 00:14:14,594
with my Anti-magic!

248
00:14:14,678 --> 00:14:16,012
[GAJA]
In accordance with your request

249
00:14:16,096 --> 00:14:17,389
that I stop holding back,

250
00:14:17,472 --> 00:14:20,016
I will now show
you my true power.

251
00:14:21,976 --> 00:14:23,687
[YAMI] I just need to
keep increasing my speed

252
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:25,772
with Mana Zone, and stop
her from throwin' out

253
00:14:25,855 --> 00:14:27,107
any new spells.

254
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,358
[yelps]

255
00:14:28,441 --> 00:14:29,943
You're not bad.

256
00:14:30,026 --> 00:14:33,113
You've developed a rudimentary
grasp of how to use Mana Zone.

257
00:14:33,196 --> 00:14:34,280
[YAMI grunts]

258
00:14:35,782 --> 00:14:38,243
[MEREOLEONA] Which means
I can stop holding back now.

259
00:14:38,326 --> 00:14:41,371
Do you seriously think you
were holding back before?

260
00:14:41,454 --> 00:14:42,622
No way.

261
00:14:42,706 --> 00:14:45,000
This gift is to thank you
for the good time.

262
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,502
Do your best not
to let it kill you.

263
00:14:52,007 --> 00:14:53,925
[MEREOLEONA yells]

264
00:14:59,764 --> 00:15:01,641
[YAMI]
Not sure I can stop all that.

265
00:15:01,725 --> 00:15:02,642
Then again,

266
00:15:02,726 --> 00:15:03,977
I have to.

267
00:15:08,106 --> 00:15:10,233
No point in asking if I can.

268
00:15:10,316 --> 00:15:12,402
I have to, so I will!

269
00:15:12,485 --> 00:15:14,154
[BOTH]
Right here, right now.

270
00:15:14,237 --> 00:15:16,406
I'll push past my limits!

271
00:15:16,489 --> 00:15:19,659
[YAMI] Mana Zone!
Dark Magic: Black Hole!

272
00:15:23,079 --> 00:15:24,456
Okay now.

273
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,754
[MEREOLEONA]
Is he nullifying my mana?

274
00:15:30,837 --> 00:15:34,341
[YAMI] Dark Magic: Dark Cloaked
Lightless Slash!

275
00:15:34,424 --> 00:15:36,217
[MEREOLEONA grunts]

276
00:15:36,301 --> 00:15:41,931
[yells] There!

277
00:15:49,731 --> 00:15:51,149
Quite impressive.

278
00:15:51,232 --> 00:15:53,360
[panting]

279
00:15:53,443 --> 00:15:54,611
Way to go, me!

280
00:15:54,694 --> 00:15:56,946
I actually got a hit in!

281
00:15:57,030 --> 00:16:01,034
[MEREOLEONA laughs]
This is getting interesting.

282
00:16:01,117 --> 00:16:02,827
Once I've burnt you to cinders,

283
00:16:02,911 --> 00:16:04,621
my bath'll be that
much more enjoyable.

284
00:16:04,704 --> 00:16:07,248
[YAMI] Nah. Got the gist
of it, so I'm leavin'.

285
00:16:07,332 --> 00:16:10,001
Don't be coy,
or are you just afraid?

286
00:16:10,085 --> 00:16:12,504
Terrified. Catch ya later.

287
00:16:17,467 --> 00:16:19,302
Well, that's disappointing.

288
00:16:24,849 --> 00:16:26,685
It's time we
shared our progress.

289
00:16:26,768 --> 00:16:28,019
Please report.

290
00:16:28,103 --> 00:16:30,105
Rill and Charmy
are doing great.

291
00:16:30,188 --> 00:16:33,525
They both took to the Mana
Method faster than expected.

292
00:16:33,608 --> 00:16:36,111
They're brilliant,
if a little unusual.

293
00:16:36,194 --> 00:16:38,571
The most I can do for them
now is prepare their meals

294
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,781
and bring out their potential

295
00:16:39,864 --> 00:16:42,075
with the occasional
word of advice.

296
00:16:43,868 --> 00:16:46,496
Charlotte and Mimosa
have come a super long way.

297
00:16:46,579 --> 00:16:48,998
They seemed confused at first,
but then something went

298
00:16:49,082 --> 00:16:50,500
"cuh-lick" in their
heads, ya know?

299
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:52,460
Our students have grown, too.

300
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:55,505
I suspect they've grown
faster than any of yours.

301
00:16:55,588 --> 00:16:57,799
Although... when someone's
being instructed

302
00:16:57,882 --> 00:16:59,217
by the Queen of
the Heart Kingdom

303
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,011
and the Great Water
Spirit herself,

304
00:17:01,094 --> 00:17:03,054
I suppose that's only
to be expected.

305
00:17:03,138 --> 00:17:06,725
[laughs] I can tell
you're proud of 'em.

306
00:17:06,808 --> 00:17:08,101
Tell me, Smurik.

307
00:17:08,184 --> 00:17:10,353
How has Finral
been coming along?

308
00:17:10,437 --> 00:17:14,024
For the time being, we must
let the wind guide us,

309
00:17:14,107 --> 00:17:17,485
and trust it to nurture the
storm that grows within him.

310
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:20,488
You have an awfully hard time
getting to the point, don't you?

311
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:22,282
Did someone say something?

312
00:17:22,365 --> 00:17:24,993
I couldn't quite make it out
over the whispers of the wind.

313
00:17:25,076 --> 00:17:26,870
Don't fight, you two.

314
00:17:26,953 --> 00:17:29,414
Floga. How goes it?

315
00:17:29,497 --> 00:17:30,832
Not bad.

316
00:17:30,915 --> 00:17:35,045
Leo's a talented mage,
but he's plagued by self-doubt.

317
00:17:35,128 --> 00:17:36,504
I think you'll
get better results

318
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:39,049
if you try to focus
on your strengths.

319
00:17:39,132 --> 00:17:42,344
My strengths? Like what?

320
00:17:42,427 --> 00:17:44,346
[FLOGA] You didn't get
this far on talent.

321
00:17:44,429 --> 00:17:46,765
You did it with patience
and determination.

322
00:17:46,848 --> 00:17:49,267
Your power grows as
your technique improves.

323
00:17:49,351 --> 00:17:51,686
With every day of practice.

324
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:52,854
You're the kind of person

325
00:17:52,937 --> 00:17:54,898
who has the strength
to endure anything.

326
00:17:54,981 --> 00:17:57,192
I mean, you're you, right?

327
00:17:58,193 --> 00:18:01,279
The strength to
endure anything...

328
00:18:01,363 --> 00:18:04,240
I wanna draw out potential
he hasn't realized yet.

329
00:18:04,324 --> 00:18:06,284
At least, that's my idea.

330
00:18:06,368 --> 00:18:07,619
We'll see how it goes.

331
00:18:07,702 --> 00:18:10,622
Yes. Well, I'm sure
you'll get through to him.

332
00:18:10,705 --> 00:18:12,248
And what about Asta?

333
00:18:12,332 --> 00:18:14,834
Asta's Anti-magic
is uniquely potent.

334
00:18:14,918 --> 00:18:17,253
We'll need it to
defeat this devil.

335
00:18:17,337 --> 00:18:19,047
As for Asta's progress...

336
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,549
He's becoming stronger
in his own way.

337
00:18:23,134 --> 00:18:26,471
Unfortunately, time is
running short now.

00:18:26,554 --> 00:18:29,015
Please put everything
you have into this training.

[GROUP]
Yes, ma'am.

340
00:18:30,767 --> 00:18:32,143
Let us join together to beat

341
00:18:32,227 --> 00:18:35,897
the Spade Kingdom and the
devil lurking within it.

00:18:48,368 --> 00:18:49,911
[RALPH]
There are so many.

343
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:56,042
Looks like they're almost ready
to start the invasion.

344
00:18:56,126 --> 00:18:59,129
If we're gonna make our move,
we need to be fast.

345
00:18:59,212 --> 00:19:00,338
Look there!

346
00:19:03,883 --> 00:19:05,260
How fortunate!

347
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:07,345
Through your labors, you
people will get to contribute

348
00:19:07,429 --> 00:19:09,764
to the Spade
Kingdom's prosperity!

349
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:11,516
Where are they making us go now?

350
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:12,976
We have to stay quiet.

[MAN 156A groans]

352

Come on, buddy!
You're almost there!

353
00:19:17,814 --> 00:19:20,316
Don't, Ralph, there are
too many of them.

354
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,152
I know, but still.

355
00:19:24,821 --> 00:19:26,906
We've reached the
strong magic region.

356
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:29,659
It's unlikely that all of us
will make it across,

357
00:19:29,743 --> 00:19:31,202
but remember, only one of us

358
00:19:31,286 --> 00:19:34,039
needs to reach
the Clover Kingdom.

359
00:19:34,122 --> 00:19:37,292
As long as one of us
makes it, there's hope.

360
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:40,503
Hang onto that hope,
no matter what happens!

361

Your friend ratted you out,

not with a beloved child's
life on the line.

Run for it!

What are you--

We're entrusting
you with our mana.

Use it well.

your father started!

No matter what it takes.

The strong magic region
is just past this cliff.

Can I really cross it?

Stop that!

Don't let their

Did we hit him?

[SOLDIER 156C]
I couldn't tell.

401
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,240
But even if he's alive,
that's a strong magic region.

The environment'll
kill him before long.

I don't like being this close
to the strong magic region.

[SOLDIER 156F]
Yes.

We interrogated one of the rebel

and learned that
his name is Ralph.
