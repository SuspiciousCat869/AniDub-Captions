160
00:08:51,312 --> 00:08:53,273
We'll work together!

161
00:08:53,356 --> 00:08:54,774
Not happenin'.

162
00:08:54,858 --> 00:08:58,111
You'd probably give it away
to the enemy by accident.

163
00:08:58,194 --> 00:09:00,405
[MIMOSA]
I mean, he's not wrong.

164
00:09:00,488 --> 00:09:02,198
Look, I've got my
way of fighting,

165
00:09:02,282 --> 00:09:03,283
and I'm stickin' to it.

166
00:09:03,366 --> 00:09:05,535
Man! Fine!

167
00:09:05,618 --> 00:09:06,995
But if you're doing
this your way,

168
00:09:07,078 --> 00:09:09,539
then you'd better believe
that I'm gonna do the same!

169
00:09:09,622 --> 00:09:11,916
It looks like they're having
a bit of an argument.

170
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,918
I hope it isn't
anything serious.

171
00:09:14,002 --> 00:09:15,253
[mumbling] They say
that constant bickering

172
00:09:15,337 --> 00:09:16,796
is the truest sign
of friendship.

173
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,174
I hope we'll have an
argument ourselves someday.

174
00:09:19,257 --> 00:09:20,383
Do you expect me to believe

175
00:09:20,467 --> 00:09:21,968
you'll come up with
your own plan?

176
00:09:22,052 --> 00:09:25,555
With that puny little
brain of yours? No way.

177
00:09:25,638 --> 00:09:27,807
Hey, I've got more brains
than I know what to do with!

178
00:09:27,891 --> 00:09:29,309
That's right,
you tell him, Asta.

179
00:09:29,392 --> 00:09:31,311
The only thing small
about you is your stature!

180
00:09:31,394 --> 00:09:33,980
Yeah, so--! Hold on, what?

181
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:36,649
Your attention!

182
00:09:36,733 --> 00:09:40,028
Team B: Xerx, Mimosa, and Asta,

183
00:09:40,111 --> 00:09:43,406
vs Team C: Kirsch,
Sol, and Magna!

184
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:46,326
Round two, match one. Begin!

185
00:09:55,669 --> 00:09:56,836
Mimosa.

186
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,880
You've stood by these
peasants for too long,

187
00:09:58,963 --> 00:10:01,341
allowing their crude
mana to taint your own.

188
00:10:01,424 --> 00:10:02,926
What a sad sight.

189
00:10:03,009 --> 00:10:04,386
But fear not, sweet sister,

190
00:10:04,469 --> 00:10:06,638
I'll release you from the
grasp of these filthy beasts

191
00:10:06,721 --> 00:10:08,973
before any of you can fight.

192
00:10:15,689 --> 00:10:17,273
[KIRSCH]
Cherry Blossom Magic:

193
00:10:17,357 --> 00:10:20,151
Raging Magic Cherry
Blossom Storm of Petals!

194
00:10:20,235 --> 00:10:22,904
Plus my beautiful illusion.

195
00:10:25,448 --> 00:10:27,492
Well now, that's quite a view.

196
00:10:27,575 --> 00:10:28,535
So pretty!

197
00:10:28,618 --> 00:10:31,454
This calls for
a celebratory snack.

198
00:10:31,538 --> 00:10:33,289
And that's for you.

199
00:10:34,457 --> 00:10:37,544
[KIRSCH] Now, in the embrace
of my most beautiful spell,

200
00:10:37,627 --> 00:10:41,423
you're free to relinquish
your soiled past self!

201
00:10:43,633 --> 00:10:45,677
[MIMOSA] I know I talked
big a minute ago,

202
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,012
but, as hard as
I've been training,

203
00:10:47,095 --> 00:10:48,596
and as much as I've improved,

204
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,975
I don't think I have a single
spell that can counter this.

205
00:10:52,058 --> 00:10:53,977
[ZORA]
We shouldn't be hasty to act.

206
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:57,564
Our best bet is to sit tight and
wait for them to set off a trap.

207
00:10:57,647 --> 00:10:59,482
[ASTA]
What an amazing spell.

208
00:10:59,566 --> 00:11:02,652
I can't see a thing right now.

209
00:11:02,736 --> 00:11:04,738
This might be our only way out.

210
00:11:05,822 --> 00:11:07,824
What is he doing?

211
00:11:14,497 --> 00:11:17,625
[ASTA]
All right. Here we go!

212
00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:21,379
[JULIUS] Hm. Feels like
something big's about to happen.

213
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:28,303
[ASTA]
That's the way. Just like that.

214
00:11:28,386 --> 00:11:30,722
Flow right on through me.

215
00:11:30,805 --> 00:11:32,515
That darkness...

216
00:11:34,684 --> 00:11:37,896
[ASTA]
Come on. Gimme more!

217
00:11:42,484 --> 00:11:44,319
[MIMOSA]
What is that aura?

218
00:11:44,402 --> 00:11:46,988
It doesn't feel
like magic at all.

219
00:11:47,072 --> 00:11:50,408
It's so strong. So fierce.

220
00:11:50,492 --> 00:11:54,621
It almost... feels sinister.

221
00:11:54,704 --> 00:11:56,623
Get ready!

222
00:12:02,045 --> 00:12:04,547
[ASTA]
Black Hurricane!

223
00:12:06,257 --> 00:12:08,343
[gasps] The cherry blossoms.

224
00:12:08,426 --> 00:12:11,262
Wait. Forget those,
he'll destroy my traps!

225
00:12:14,891 --> 00:12:16,309
Wow. Asta's good.

226
00:12:16,393 --> 00:12:18,061
That attack. It's from before.

227
00:12:18,144 --> 00:12:19,646
[mumbling] Indeed, I knew
he'd been practicing it

228
00:12:19,729 --> 00:12:21,356
ever since his trip
to the volcano,

229
00:12:21,439 --> 00:12:22,524
but I didn't realize
he'd increased its power

230
00:12:22,607 --> 00:12:23,900
to such a degree.

231
00:12:23,983 --> 00:12:26,403
I truly am proud to call
Asta my friend and comrade.

232
00:12:26,486 --> 00:12:29,114
[FINRAL] He's wiping out the
cherry blossoms bit by bit!

233
00:12:38,289 --> 00:12:39,624
Impossible.

234
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:42,335
How'd that lowborn runt summon
such a dreadful power?

235
00:12:53,054 --> 00:12:54,222
--[SOL] Look at that.
--[MAGNA] Not bad.

236
00:12:54,305 --> 00:12:57,559
He's pretty strong.
I know that wasn't easy.

237
00:13:00,228 --> 00:13:02,939
[MIMOSA] Wow. That
was amazing! Nice work!

238
00:13:03,023 --> 00:13:05,859
Do you have any idea
what you've just done?

239
00:13:06,901 --> 00:13:08,403
[ASTA]
You seem kinda pissed.

240
00:13:08,486 --> 00:13:10,989
I guess you really do care
about these fights.

241
00:13:12,574 --> 00:13:16,494
Now! Let's join forces and
win this thing together!

242
00:13:16,578 --> 00:13:18,913
You rotten imbecile.

243
00:13:18,997 --> 00:13:24,252
[KIRSCH gasping]
What is this ugliness?

244
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:25,962
What in the world happened?

245
00:13:26,046 --> 00:13:29,632
How did that commoner
dispel all that magic?

246
00:13:29,716 --> 00:13:33,219
Asta will only get
stronger from here on.

247
00:13:33,303 --> 00:13:35,221
[YUNO]
And same goes for me.

248
00:13:35,305 --> 00:13:36,723
Very impressive.

249
00:13:36,806 --> 00:13:39,392
It would seem Asta's mastered
yet another curious power.

250
00:13:39,476 --> 00:13:41,269
Open wide, 'kay?

251
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:43,855
[ZORA] Do you ever think
before you act, runt?

252
00:13:43,938 --> 00:13:47,192
All the time I spent setting
traps is wasted effort now.

253
00:13:47,275 --> 00:13:49,444
[ASTA giggles]
It sure was!

254
00:13:49,527 --> 00:13:52,238
They're all gone. Rough, I know.

255
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,742
[ASTA]
But it happened.

256
00:13:55,825 --> 00:13:58,495
Time for you to give
us a back-up plan!

257
00:13:58,578 --> 00:14:00,205
One where all three
of us can win this!

258
00:14:00,288 --> 00:14:01,081
Huh?

259
00:14:01,164 --> 00:14:02,123
[ASTA]
You're a crafty guy.

260
00:14:02,207 --> 00:14:04,125
I'm sure you can
think of somethin'.

261
00:14:04,209 --> 00:14:05,919
Come up with a new
underhanded plan

262
00:14:06,002 --> 00:14:08,004
and we'll beat those
guys fair and square!

263
00:14:08,088 --> 00:14:09,506
[laughs]

264
00:14:09,589 --> 00:14:12,967
You do realize that you're
contradicting yourself, right?

265
00:14:13,051 --> 00:14:14,135
[MIMOSA]
Thank goodness.

266
00:14:14,219 --> 00:14:16,262
Looks like the old Asta's back.

267
00:14:16,346 --> 00:14:17,597
We don't need a plan.

268
00:14:17,681 --> 00:14:19,015
That attack of yours should
be more than enough

269
00:14:19,099 --> 00:14:21,434
to take out their team.
So go get 'em.

270
00:14:21,518 --> 00:14:25,480
[laughs] Totally would,
but unfortunately for you,

271
00:14:25,563 --> 00:14:26,898
that move takes a lot out of me,

272
00:14:26,981 --> 00:14:28,233
so I'm gonna have
to wait a while

273
00:14:28,316 --> 00:14:29,818
before I can whip it out again.

274
00:14:29,901 --> 00:14:32,320
Why are you acting so
damn happy about it?

275
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:35,365
Seriously, are you
sick in the head, kid?

276
00:14:35,448 --> 00:14:36,574
Don't you get it yet?

277
00:14:36,658 --> 00:14:38,702
I want us all to fight
as a friggin' team!

278
00:14:38,785 --> 00:14:41,454
So I don't care if you laid out
all those traps yesterday!

279
00:14:41,538 --> 00:14:43,456
It's time you started
treating me and Mimosa

280
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,708
like real partners.

281
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:46,084
[MIMOSA gasps]

282
00:14:46,167 --> 00:14:48,044
[ASTA] We're fighting to get
picked as Royal Knights.

283
00:14:48,128 --> 00:14:49,963
If we win, it'll be
on us to take down

284
00:14:50,046 --> 00:14:52,799
the Eye of the Midnight Sun.
No one can fight them alone.

285
00:14:52,882 --> 00:14:54,718
Not me. Not you. Not anyone!

286
00:14:54,801 --> 00:14:56,136
There's only one
way to beat a team

287
00:14:56,219 --> 00:14:58,013
as strong as that,
n' guess what?

288
00:14:58,096 --> 00:15:00,432
It's by makin' a team
that's stronger!

289
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,477
[ZARA]
Look, son.

290
00:15:04,561 --> 00:15:07,355
Yes, my fellow Magic Knights
are amazing people,

291
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:09,357
but the thing that
makes us amazing

292
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:11,526
is that we never have
to stand alone.

293
00:15:11,609 --> 00:15:15,238
We all trust that if we face
death, we'll face it together.

294
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,869
[ASTA] Look, the team that
we're up against right now

295
00:15:20,952 --> 00:15:23,079
has the vice captain of
the Coral Peacocks in it.

296
00:15:23,163 --> 00:15:25,623
He's a real piece of work,
but he's also strong!

297
00:15:25,707 --> 00:15:27,334
We need to hit that
jerk hard and fast

298
00:15:27,417 --> 00:15:29,336
with everything we've got!

299
00:15:31,629 --> 00:15:33,089
What the--?

300
00:15:33,173 --> 00:15:35,800
Hey, if you don't like my ideas
then just say so next time!

301
00:15:35,884 --> 00:15:39,054
I wanna join that royal guard
like I want a pet tapeworm.

302
00:15:39,137 --> 00:15:40,555
[gasps]

303
00:15:40,638 --> 00:15:43,391
But my goals aren't about
to achieve themselves.

304
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:45,226
So I guess that leaves
me with no choice

305
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:48,271
but to put you to use,
ya little punk.

306
00:15:48,355 --> 00:15:50,815
[laughs] I don't really
care what your motive is.

307
00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:54,527
All that matters to me
is that we fight together.

308
00:15:54,611 --> 00:15:55,987
[ZORA]
Huh.

309
00:15:57,364 --> 00:15:59,074
[ZORA]
As I'm sure you've noticed,

310
00:15:59,157 --> 00:16:01,117
my magic attribute is Ash.

311
00:16:01,201 --> 00:16:03,453
And my specialty is Trap magic.

312
00:16:04,871 --> 00:16:07,665
[ZORA] But it's not exactly easy
to create large-scale traps

313
00:16:07,749 --> 00:16:09,834
like the ones from
our last match.

314
00:16:09,918 --> 00:16:12,420
Bigger traps require a lot
more time and magic power

315
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:16,007
to get going, but they're
also far more effective.

316
00:16:16,091 --> 00:16:18,426
I told you I didn't get
any sleep last night.

317
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,679
[MIMOSA, ASTA]
Wait, that was actually true?

318
00:16:20,762 --> 00:16:22,222
You and your weird
sword blew away

319
00:16:22,305 --> 00:16:24,182
a whole night of work
just like that.

320
00:16:24,265 --> 00:16:25,642
Yeah, sorry about that,

321
00:16:25,725 --> 00:16:28,687
but we didn't really have
a whole lotta options.

322
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,105
[ZORA]
Lemme think.

323
00:16:30,188 --> 00:16:33,149
There are some traps that
I can pull off right now.

324
00:16:33,233 --> 00:16:34,818
Three, actually

325
00:16:34,901 --> 00:16:36,319
'Kay, what are they?

326
00:16:36,403 --> 00:16:38,113
[ZORA]
First one's a snare trap.

327
00:16:38,196 --> 00:16:40,990
Touch the magic circle,
and it roots you in place.

328
00:16:41,074 --> 00:16:42,075
Ensnares you.

329
00:16:42,158 --> 00:16:43,618
[ASTA]
Cool, cool. Go on.

330
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:45,620
[ZORA]
Next up is the pitfall trap.

331
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:47,372
It's pretty
straightforward, too.

332
00:16:47,455 --> 00:16:50,542
Ya dig a hole, and wait for
your target to fall inside.

333
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,043
[ASTA]
Very nice!

334
00:16:52,127 --> 00:16:54,713
[ZORA] Trap type number
three is the landmine.

335
00:16:54,796 --> 00:16:57,382
It triggers a simple
attack spell on contact.

336
00:16:57,465 --> 00:16:59,050
[ASTA]
Yeah, I remember that one.

337
00:16:59,134 --> 00:17:02,012
All of those traps'll disappear
once they've been set off.

338
00:17:02,095 --> 00:17:04,806
So unless I invest a lot of
time and magic power in them,

339
00:17:04,889 --> 00:17:06,766
we can't expect much payoff.

340
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:10,478
Now. What'll it be, kid?

341
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:13,273
[KIRSCH]
Dear me. I can't believe it.

342
00:17:13,356 --> 00:17:15,150
To think that my
perfectly beautiful spell

343
00:17:15,233 --> 00:17:16,401
was corrupted and destroyed

344
00:17:16,484 --> 00:17:18,570
by that peasant's
insidious weapon.

345
00:17:18,653 --> 00:17:22,073
Heh, you know, I can't
say I'm surprised.

346
00:17:22,157 --> 00:17:25,577
See, I knew that Asta had been
practicing that move plenty.

347
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,661
The kid put in the work,

348
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:28,872
and now he's got
an ace up his sleeve.

349
00:17:28,955 --> 00:17:31,374
Maybe this'll teach you not
to underestimate commoners.

350
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:34,127
Oh, side note, I'm one myself.

351
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:35,337
Don't say it!

352
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,380
You mean to tell me
you're a commoner, too?

353
00:17:37,464 --> 00:17:38,590
Yeah.

354
00:17:38,673 --> 00:17:40,425
And if it mattered,
you would've noticed.

355
00:17:40,508 --> 00:17:41,885
Oh, no!

356
00:17:41,968 --> 00:17:43,595
I could never fight
beside a commoner!

357
00:17:43,678 --> 00:17:45,680
I would just end up
being defiled!

358

Hey! Wait up ya damn narcissist!

We already fought together once!

360
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:54,522
What's it gonna hurt
to do it one more time?

361
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:56,524
There's no need.
I have power enough

362
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:58,818
to eliminate these
fools by myself.

363
00:17:58,902 --> 00:18:01,905
You two stay there and
protect the crystal!

the same, guess again.

Good grief.

certainly is stupid.

Commoners are brutish.

371

They are unclean.

372
00:18:16,086 --> 00:18:19,297
And they are fundamentally
lacking in magic power.
