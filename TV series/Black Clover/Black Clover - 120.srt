Use that weapon to
destroy me for good.

162
00:10:10,225 --> 00:10:11,810
Sure that's what you want?

163
00:10:15,063 --> 00:10:17,440
I've already lived twice now.

164
00:10:17,524 --> 00:10:21,778
I have regrets, but no fear.
After all that I did,

165
00:10:21,861 --> 00:10:24,823
I'm not sure this is
enough to atone for it.

166
00:10:24,906 --> 00:10:27,242
Patry...

167
00:10:27,325 --> 00:10:30,412
I'll be the first one
to leave, then.

168
00:10:30,495 --> 00:10:35,125
Forgive me, Licht.
Please finish this.

169
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:36,501
I will.

170
00:10:46,011 --> 00:10:48,471
[PATRY] In the end, I got
to fight alongside Licht

171
00:10:48,555 --> 00:10:51,516
and all my friends.
That's enough.

It's Captain Vangeance.

who's been with me

175
00:11:13,204 --> 00:11:15,707
ever since I was a child.

176
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:19,586
It seems your rage and suffering
have finally reached an end.

177
00:11:21,254 --> 00:11:24,424
But, the story's not over yet.

178
00:11:24,507 --> 00:11:27,218
This time, it's my turn.

179
00:11:27,302 --> 00:11:31,097
This mark that was carved
upon my face without reason.

180
00:11:31,181 --> 00:11:35,477
The curse that brought me
so much mistreatment and hatred.

181
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,646
Because of it, his warped
feelings for the kingdom

182
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,357
and the suffering
he went through

183
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,068
were undoubtably real to me.

184
00:11:43,151 --> 00:11:45,445
This battle happened
because I was too weak

185
00:11:45,528 --> 00:11:47,822
to believe in Julius's strength,

186
00:11:47,906 --> 00:11:50,784
or in the future
I was meant to protect.

187
00:11:50,867 --> 00:11:52,702
Therefore...

188
00:11:52,786 --> 00:11:56,456
I should be the one who puts
a stop to this violence!

189
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:08,677
[LICHT] I'll connect to their

[VILLAGER 120B] Does this mean
that they saved the kingdom?

I shoulda known.

205
00:13:48,943 --> 00:13:51,321
Apparently, the three of us
won't be going with you.

206
00:13:53,031 --> 00:13:55,283
See, after we got reincarnated
the second time,

207
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:57,702
our souls became bound
to these bodies.

208
00:13:57,786 --> 00:14:01,581
There's no way we can go
back to our original forms.

209
00:14:01,664 --> 00:14:04,501
I see. That's a shame.

210
00:14:04,584 --> 00:14:07,253
After a journey filled
with pain and hatred,

211
00:14:07,337 --> 00:14:09,422
it'd be nice if we could talk.

212

But, nothing to be done now.

213
00:14:13,635 --> 00:14:17,055
Perhaps there's a reason our
destinies played out this way.

214
00:14:17,138 --> 00:14:21,601
Live on in this world,
for all of our sakes.

Take care.

00:14:25,146 --> 00:14:28,900
That figures. We missed
each other again.

00:14:28,983 --> 00:14:31,653
But if this is what
you want, then okay.

219
00:14:31,736 --> 00:14:33,530
I guess I'll live this
life to the fullest,

220
00:14:33,613 --> 00:14:35,782
no matter how much
of a pain it is.

my younger brother again.

with you, Yami Sukehiro.

Well, look at you, Charla,

That's sweet.

I admit, I may be
a little awkward,

but not as awkward as she is.

be going now.

what happened, actually.

317
00:19:47,177 --> 00:19:48,678
[BOTH]
Really?

318
00:19:48,762 --> 00:19:51,014
[ASTA] You were awakened
by magic, right?

319
00:19:51,097 --> 00:19:53,308
Oh, man, I can't wait
to be a super-awesome

320
00:19:53,391 --> 00:19:55,727
Wizard King just
like you someday!

321
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:58,396
And guess what else?
That's Nero!

322
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,522
[NOELLE]
The bird?

323
00:19:59,606 --> 00:20:01,191
Wow, Asta, you must
have hit your head

324
00:20:01,274 --> 00:20:03,109
--pretty hard if you think that.
--[SECRÉ] It's true.

325
00:20:03,193 --> 00:20:04,361
[NOELLE, MIMOSA]
What?!

326
00:20:04,444 --> 00:20:05,904
You know...

327
00:20:05,987 --> 00:20:07,947
I always thought you were
a pretty cool little bird,

328
00:20:08,031 --> 00:20:09,783
but now that I know you can
turn yourself into a human,

329
00:20:09,866 --> 00:20:12,202
I think you might be the
coolest bird that ever lived!

330
00:20:12,285 --> 00:20:14,245
I didn't transform
into a human.

331
00:20:14,329 --> 00:20:16,081
I was a human to begin with.

332
00:20:16,164 --> 00:20:18,333
Then why didn't you
tell me before?

333
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:20,669
Because up until the
Shadow Palace appeared,

334
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:22,379
I wasn't able to talk.

335
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:25,840
[SECRÉ] Now, I have a
question to ask you.

336
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:27,008
What makes you
think you can ever

337
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:28,718
hold a candle to His Highness?

338
00:20:28,802 --> 00:20:31,763
Look, I know we're old pals,
but please cut that out!

339
00:20:31,846 --> 00:20:34,140
[NOELLE] So, the spunky,
adorable Nero is...

340
00:20:34,224 --> 00:20:37,519
Well, she's spunky and adorable.

341
00:20:37,602 --> 00:20:39,938
[sighs] Well, to me,
"Wizard King"

342
00:20:40,021 --> 00:20:42,357
is nothing but a simple phrase.

343
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,275
But thanks to you
and your rival,

344
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:47,112
it's become clear to me
that our ideals

345
00:20:47,195 --> 00:20:49,614
live on with this
generation, as well.

346
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:51,491
Now then.

347
00:20:51,574 --> 00:20:53,535
Which one of you
will take my place?

348
00:20:53,618 --> 00:20:55,453
[ASTA]
Ooh, ooh, that'll be me, sir!

349
00:20:55,537 --> 00:20:57,455
[SECRÉ] You're nothing
compared to him, Asta.

350
00:20:57,539 --> 00:20:59,124
[ASTA]
You're mean!

351
00:20:59,207 --> 00:21:00,208
[laughs]

352
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:03,753
[gasps]

353
00:21:03,837 --> 00:21:04,963
[gasps]

354
00:21:05,046 --> 00:21:06,756
The time has come.

355
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,091
I don't have enough magic

356
00:21:08,174 --> 00:21:10,468
to hold this body
together anymore.

357
00:21:10,552 --> 00:21:11,469
[BOTH gasp]

358
00:21:11,553 --> 00:21:12,637
[gasps]

359
00:21:12,721 --> 00:21:14,973
[MIMOSA] My Recovery Magic
can't fix this!

360
00:21:15,056 --> 00:21:16,683
My prince.

361
00:21:16,766 --> 00:21:19,769
[LUMIERE]
Secré. Or, Nero, I suppose.

362
00:21:19,853 --> 00:21:22,147
Will you watch their
futures play out?

363
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:25,400
Watch them make the
world better, for my sake?

364
00:21:25,483 --> 00:21:27,360
I've always been...

365
00:21:27,444 --> 00:21:29,279
Well, um... I mean...

366
00:21:29,362 --> 00:21:33,074
Anyway. Let me go
with you! Please, sir!

367
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:35,702
I gave everything 500 years ago.

368
00:21:35,785 --> 00:21:37,746
I should have died that day.

369
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:41,666
But then, you helped
me protect the future.

370
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,918
Let me go.

371
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:47,172
Like I said, I can't let you
seal off your potential.

372
00:21:49,257 --> 00:21:51,718
[LUMIERE] I think the path
ahead is a bright one.

373
00:21:51,801 --> 00:21:54,095
Both for the Magic Knights
and for the kingdom

374
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:55,764
they'll fight to defend.

375
00:21:58,266 --> 00:22:00,894
I even met my descendants.

376
00:22:00,977 --> 00:22:02,145
I'm happy.

377
00:22:06,483 --> 00:22:09,152
So am I, really!

378
00:22:09,235 --> 00:22:10,653
Serving you for so long...

379
00:22:10,737 --> 00:22:12,947
It... It was an honor!

380
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:16,618
I was honored
to have you. Secré.

381
00:22:16,701 --> 00:22:21,623
Thank you for everything.
You did well. Goodbye.

382
00:23:22,308 --> 00:23:24,853
What the hell is this?

383
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:27,188
Julius's body is missing!

384
00:23:28,982 --> 00:23:31,276
[YAMI] But I know it
was hidden in there.

385
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:33,361
[gasps]

386
00:23:34,029 --> 00:23:35,321
[YAMI]
That magic!

387
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:48,501
[YAMI gasps]

388
00:23:48,585 --> 00:23:52,672
What? No way! Are you Julius?

389
00:23:56,634 --> 00:23:58,595
[YAMI]
The long night's finally over.

390
00:23:58,678 --> 00:24:00,638
Look at that gorgeous sunrise!

391
00:24:00,722 --> 00:24:03,516
It's the new dawn
of the Clover Kingdom.

392
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,520
<i>Black Clover</i> , Page 121:
"Three Problems."

393
00:24:07,604 --> 00:24:09,731
Damn, this old dude's
off his rocker.
