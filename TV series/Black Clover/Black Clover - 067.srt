00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:15,708
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:18,541
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:24,625
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:27,125
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:35,708
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:39,791
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,708
[NARRATOR]
And, today...

8
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:46,500
[ASTA yelling]

9
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:47,833
Now that my arms are better,

10
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:51,166
I gotta work real hard
and make up for lost time!

11
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,083
[NARRATOR]
It looks like peace has finally

12
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:55,583
returned to the
Black Bulls' hideout.

13
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:57,416
Kinda boring with
nothing goin' on

14
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,125
around here, don't you think?

15
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:01,666
I could get used to this!

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,250
[NARRATOR]
Then, a lone mage stepped in

17
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,958
and spoiled the tranquility.

18
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:11,416
[YAMI]
Listen up.

19
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,875
[ALL]
Hm?

20
00:01:13,958 --> 00:01:17,333
[NARRATOR] He was known as
the captain of the Black Bulls.

21
00:01:17,416 --> 00:01:20,833
And for some reason,
he wore a <i>happi</i> coat.

22
00:01:25,416 --> 00:01:28,125
There's a big festival
goin' on today.

23
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:29,833
[BOTH]
Festival?

24
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:02,000
[ASTA]
Captain Yami!

25
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:04,500
Tell me more about
this big festival!

26
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:06,208
Well, I can tell ya
one thing, Asta.

27
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:09,125
It's pretty freakin'
awesome! Does that help?

28
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:10,250
Yeah, totally!

29
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:12,875
Wait, I still don't understand!

30
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:14,625
That doesn't help at all.

31
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:16,458
You! Tell us what
the festival is,

32
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:18,583
and be as detailed as you can.

33
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:20,750
Me? Oh right, sure!

34
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,833
[FINRAL]
I'm your superior.

35
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:24,125
[FINRAL]
As you know,

36
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,500
Magic Knight Squads
receive stars as a reward

37
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:27,791
for good performance.

38
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,791
And we compete with
all the usual suspects

39
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:32,458
to see who can get the most.

40
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:34,583
This festival is where they
announce the total number

41
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:36,500
of stars distributed
over the past year

42
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,125
and crown the winning squad.

43
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:41,125
[ASTA]
Ooh! Let's aim for the top!

44
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:43,458
Except our squad does
nothing but cause trouble,

45
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:45,916
which means we're always
in a race for dead last.

46
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,291
[YAMI]
No.

47
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:50,708
[YAMI]
We're in last by a mile.

48
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,916
No one else has negative stars.

49
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,083
Really?! Come on,
how terrible can we be?

50
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:58,166
As I was saying,
the festival is attended

51
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,958
and enjoyed by citizens
all over the Clover Kingdom

52
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,250
as the largest public
event of its kind.

53
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:04,708
[YAMI]
It's called...

54
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:09,625
...the Star Festival.

55
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:10,875
[BLACK BULLS cheer]

56
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,541
Nice one, boss!

57
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:13,666
This is nuts!

58
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,291
I've never seen him
get this fired up!

59
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:18,541
[YAMI] Yeah, festival's
are fine I guess.

60
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:19,666
It's, uh, you know, whatever.

61
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,208
[NOELLE]
Your clothes say otherwise.

62
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:23,250
[MAGNA]
I'm with you, Captain Yami!

63
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:27,541
--[MAGNA, LUCK] Festival!
--[FINRAL] Ladies! Ladies!

64
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:30,541
[ASTA] Oh, hey, wait a second!
Before we leave...

65
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:31,666
Huh?

66
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,208
If it's not a problem,
do you think

67
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:35,208
we could bring a couple
friends along?

68
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:56,333
[ASTA]
So cool!

69
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:57,833
Here we are!

70
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,875
Now you rascals
go have some fun!

71
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:01,416
We've still got
plenty of free time

72
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,750
before the announcement!

73
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:05,458
Yahoo! Where's the booze?

74
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:07,375
Festival food!

75
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:10,250
I think I'll grab
a bite to eat, too!

76
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,916
I'll try to pick out a nice
souvenir for my sweet sister.

77
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,166
I wonder if there's anybody
here who wants to fight me?

78
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,708
[GREY growls]

79

[CHILD 67A]
Hey!

80
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:24,958
Where were they selling that
funny-looking mask, Mister?

There's so much
stuff to do here!

00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,666
I wish my friends in
the village could see it!

Just try not to get distracted
and wind up lost somewhere.

87
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:42,833
Then again, I guess I could
walk around with you

88
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:44,791
if you really wanted me to.

It's been so long!

[NOELLE]
How did you get here?

97
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,958
I asked Finral
to make a pit stop

98
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:04,541
and pick 'em up for me.

99
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:06,041
[FINRAL]
Just wanted to do something nice

100
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:08,208
for my adorable pal here.

Now, if you'll excuse me,

I have some girls to
sweep off their feet.

It's amazing!

You saved the Underwater Temple

from the Eye of
the Midnight Sun,

108

and as if that wasn't enough,
you bring us here, too?

We're really grateful, Asta.

strain yourself, Kahono.

must be dying to sing.

your foot, right?

[KIATO]
Huh? Yeah.

00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,125
I preserved it with water magic,

me to bring it?

It's from the Forest of Witches.

some of the Queen's
Recovery Magic!

Perfect timing!

Oh, Magna, you surprised me.

What's that huge
thing you're holding?

Shouldn't that be obvious?

It's a fireworks cannon!

Did you say fireworks?

167
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:20,041
That's right. As soon as
it gets good and dark out,

into this, though.
