Threatened by a ruthless demon,

humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:32,105 --> 00:00:34,399
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

00:00:34,482 --> 00:00:37,068
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

00:00:43,533 --> 00:00:45,577
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

00:01:25,033 --> 00:01:28,078
discovered that Hage Village,

was being threatened
by a violent elf

The elf spirit inside him
is crying out in pain.

00:01:49,683 --> 00:01:53,228
[ASTA] Is it possible?
Are the elves asking for help?

Hey, Yuno!

[YUNO]
Let's go, Asta!

35
00:01:56,815 --> 00:01:59,275
He's turning into something
that's not an elf at all!

00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:01,111

[ASTA] Now that I have
this sword, I can save them!

Huh? What's up with that

I don't believe this.

Where did that thing come from?

There's no time to get

It's coming from the
north and the south.

59
00:05:08,214 --> 00:05:10,050
[DIGIT] Since there are
two places in danger,

60
00:05:10,133 --> 00:05:12,177
perhaps we should split up?

I think there was somebody
he wanted to see.

Was it you two?
Either way, he can't.

00:06:19,244 --> 00:06:21,996
Because thanks to the
Reincarnation spell,

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,624
this body now belongs
to me, Rufel!

Luck and the rest

even though his body
is possessed right now.

would have killed you!

before was the truth,

then Luck's lying
dormant in that body!

wake up out of shock!

00:10:17,732 --> 00:10:22,946
Too easy! You could at least
make it a challenge for me!

163
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:24,823
Whoops!

164
00:10:24,906 --> 00:10:26,533
I thought you said these
things would explode

165
00:10:26,616 --> 00:10:29,369
even if they missed! You
wouldn't lie to me, would ya?

166
00:10:29,452 --> 00:10:31,621
Or did you run out of magic?

167
00:10:34,749 --> 00:10:36,835
[VANESSA] If he's dodging
by sensing the mana,

168
00:10:36,918 --> 00:10:40,213
Magna can just throw in
some regular Scattershots!

169
00:10:40,296 --> 00:10:42,549
[MAGNA] From this
distance, I can't miss!

170
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:45,385
[LUCK]
Ha, ha!

171
00:10:45,468 --> 00:10:46,553
[gasps]

172
00:10:46,636 --> 00:10:51,099
[LUCK] Too bad.
I picked up on your mana.

173
00:10:51,182 --> 00:10:53,476
[MAGNA]
Nice trick, but I already knew

174
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,687
you had that up your sleeve.

175
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:58,106
And I know how fast you are!

176
00:11:03,236 --> 00:11:04,821
[LUCK] Did he just make
sure it would explode

177
00:11:04,904 --> 00:11:07,657
at that exact moment?

178
00:11:07,741 --> 00:11:10,118
[MAGNA]
You're definitely not Luck.

179
00:11:11,327 --> 00:11:13,830
Because he woulda figured out...

180
00:11:14,914 --> 00:11:18,084
...I'm stupid enough
to blow myself up, too!

181
00:11:27,218 --> 00:11:29,554
You're a wily fella,
I'll give ya that much,

182
00:11:29,637 --> 00:11:33,475
but only Luck himself
coulda seen that comin'!

183
00:11:33,558 --> 00:11:34,934
And I know how to take a hit,

184
00:11:35,018 --> 00:11:37,270
which is more than
I can say for you!

185
00:11:37,354 --> 00:11:42,650
Flame Magic: Gargantuan
Exploding Fireball!

186
00:11:49,949 --> 00:11:53,244
[MAGNA] One more thing.
Flame Bondage Formation!

187
00:11:55,246 --> 00:11:57,749
[panting]

188
00:11:57,832 --> 00:12:03,213
Listen man, I happen to know
Luck pretty damn well.

189
00:12:03,296 --> 00:12:05,757
You're nothin' but an imposter.

190
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,467
And that means, you don't know

191
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:10,053
the first thing about
him or about me!

192
00:12:10,136 --> 00:12:14,641
So come at me all you want,
but you'll never win.

193
00:12:14,724 --> 00:12:18,395
Now give our squadmate
back to us, right now!

194
00:12:23,858 --> 00:12:28,988
--[LUCK laughing]
--What?

195
00:12:29,072 --> 00:12:30,365
[MAGNA]
You!

196
00:12:38,456 --> 00:12:40,583
Whoa. What the--?

197
00:12:49,467 --> 00:12:52,178
[LUCK]
I'm sorry.

198
00:12:52,262 --> 00:12:55,515
Who can never win?

199
00:12:55,598 --> 00:12:57,726
Think again, human!

200
00:13:12,532 --> 00:13:14,034
[LUCK]
Now, would you care to explain

201
00:13:14,117 --> 00:13:17,078
how you two weaklings
plan to defeat me?

202
00:13:17,162 --> 00:13:19,205
I'd just love to hear.

203
00:13:19,289 --> 00:13:20,790
Keep on talkin'.

204
00:13:20,874 --> 00:13:22,417
I'll throw as many
of these fireballs

205
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,754
as I have to until
Luck wakes up!

206
00:13:25,837 --> 00:13:28,048
Ah! He vanished!

207
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:31,384
[LUCK]
Forget it.

208
00:13:31,468 --> 00:13:34,012
You won't put another
scratch on me.

209
00:13:36,222 --> 00:13:38,892
[MAGNA]
He's so fast, I can't see him!

210
00:13:44,606 --> 00:13:48,026
You slow humans could never
catch me at this speed!

211
00:13:52,822 --> 00:13:54,574
I thought the guy
was a monster before,

212
00:13:54,657 --> 00:13:56,493
but this is somethin' else!

213
00:13:56,576 --> 00:13:58,286
Looking for me?

214
00:14:01,081 --> 00:14:03,083
Well, here I am!

215
00:14:04,084 --> 00:14:06,961
Looking for me? Oh, no--

216
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:12,759
The cat.

217
00:14:12,842 --> 00:14:14,678
[meows]

218
00:14:14,761 --> 00:14:16,429
[LUCK]
Controlling the future.

219
00:14:16,513 --> 00:14:19,391
No, controlling fate
is more like it.

220
00:14:19,474 --> 00:14:24,062
Oh, well. Even a cat
only has so many lives.

221
00:14:24,145 --> 00:14:26,147
And I'm sure that
spell really drains

222
00:14:26,231 --> 00:14:28,274
your magic reserves, right?

223
00:14:28,358 --> 00:14:30,318
The elves are the ones
who were originally blessed

224
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:33,488
by mana, so between you and me.

225
00:14:33,571 --> 00:14:37,033
Which one of us do you
think will last longer?

226
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:43,373
[grunts]

227
00:14:48,044 --> 00:14:49,921
[laughs]

228
00:14:57,178 --> 00:15:01,641
[VANESSA panting]

229
00:15:01,725 --> 00:15:03,852
Don't tell me you're
tired already!

230
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:06,479
I haven't even
broken a sweat yet!

231
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:31,171
[LUCK giggles] I warned you
about getting in my way.

232
00:15:31,254 --> 00:15:33,048
Let me go.

233
00:15:33,131 --> 00:15:35,884
[meows]

234
00:15:40,055 --> 00:15:43,099
Now every human in
this kingdom will die.

235
00:15:43,183 --> 00:15:44,434
That's the fate you deserve,

236
00:15:44,517 --> 00:15:47,729
and we elves will be happy
to make it a reality!

237
00:15:47,812 --> 00:15:50,440
Shut up, you freak.

238
00:15:53,985 --> 00:15:55,987
Not one more word.

239
00:15:56,071 --> 00:15:59,282
It doesn't matter to me
whether you're an elf or not.

240
00:15:59,366 --> 00:16:02,327
Because I'm through
talkin' to you.

241
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:05,080
Luck is the one I wanna talk to.

242
00:16:05,163 --> 00:16:09,167
So you hurry up and get
outta that body, right now.

243
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,752
You hear me?

244
00:16:10,835 --> 00:16:12,587
Luck is mischievous.

245
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:15,632
Always being reckless
and causing trouble,

246
00:16:15,715 --> 00:16:20,011
but he's still like my little
brother! Let go of him!

247
00:16:20,095 --> 00:16:22,806
All you humans are
selfish traitors.

248
00:16:22,889 --> 00:16:25,266
Why should I believe
that you care about him?

249
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:28,269
[laughs] Don't make me
laugh, there's nothing

250
00:16:28,353 --> 00:16:30,146
that can undo the
reincarnation spell,

251
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,940
especially not
whatever flimsy bond

252
00:16:32,023 --> 00:16:34,359
you claim to have
with this Luck person.

253
00:16:34,442 --> 00:16:37,987
That disgusting human soul
has already been destroyed!

254
00:16:38,071 --> 00:16:42,450
[LUCK cackles]

255
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:46,454
Is that right? Well,
if that's how it is...

256
00:16:49,124 --> 00:16:52,043
[MAGNA]
Then what are you cryin' for?

257
00:16:52,127 --> 00:16:54,796
You're actin' like
someone you're not,

258
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:57,215
but I can tell that
you're in there, Luck!

259
00:16:57,298 --> 00:16:58,842
Somewhere!

260
00:16:58,925 --> 00:17:00,051
And I want you
to know that while

261
00:17:00,135 --> 00:17:01,803
you were goofin' off,
I was workin' hard

262
00:17:01,886 --> 00:17:04,264
and trainin' myself
to be stronger!

263
00:17:04,347 --> 00:17:07,058
If that pisses you off,
then snap out of it

264
00:17:07,142 --> 00:17:09,436
and fight me already,
you little moron!

265
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:11,438
[LUCK]
That's enough.

266
00:17:14,524 --> 00:17:16,276
[VANESSA]
Luck! If you think you can

267
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:19,988
get rid of us that easily,
you've got another thing coming!

268
00:17:20,071 --> 00:17:22,032
My red thread of fate has you,

269
00:17:22,115 --> 00:17:24,492
and I am never
letting go of you!

270
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:26,911
Take control of your
body and stop this!

271
00:17:26,995 --> 00:17:28,413
No. Shut up!

272
00:17:28,496 --> 00:17:29,789
[VANESSA]
I won't!

273
00:17:29,873 --> 00:17:31,708
It's not gonna work!

274
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:33,043
[MAGNA]
Come on!

275
00:17:33,126 --> 00:17:36,880
Shut your mouth!

276
00:17:36,963 --> 00:17:38,423
Please don't!

277
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,302
It's over, human!

278
00:17:42,385 --> 00:17:44,846
Luck!

279
00:17:50,727 --> 00:17:53,063
[ASTA]
You think I'd let you hurt them?

280
00:17:56,149 --> 00:17:58,151
Not a chance!

281
00:17:59,277 --> 00:18:01,780
[VANESSA]
Rouge used up all her power

282
00:18:01,863 --> 00:18:05,075
to trigger a destiny that
would bring Asta here!

283
00:18:06,659 --> 00:18:08,620
[meows]

284
00:18:10,413 --> 00:18:12,415
And who are you?

285
00:18:12,499 --> 00:18:14,918
[ASTA]
I think you know.

286
00:18:15,001 --> 00:18:18,296
But I'll say it
as much as it takes.

287
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,799
We're Luck's friends and
fellow Magic Knights!

288
00:18:20,882 --> 00:18:24,135
[panting]

289
00:18:24,219 --> 00:18:25,512
Asta.

290
00:18:25,595 --> 00:18:27,555
Thank goodness.

291
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:29,432
[LUCK]
Friends, huh?

292
00:18:29,516 --> 00:18:33,228
This whole routine
is starting to get old.

293
00:18:33,311 --> 00:18:36,314
Hey, wait a second, you don't
have any magic, do you?

294
00:18:36,398 --> 00:18:37,565
I didn't think it was possible

295
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:40,902
for anyone to be that
despised by mana.

296
00:18:40,985 --> 00:18:42,028
Yeah, well, there's one group

297
00:18:42,112 --> 00:18:44,572
who accepts me
just the way I am!

298
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:47,158
And they're called
the Black Bulls!

299
00:18:47,242 --> 00:18:50,537
Luck is part of that group,
so you can't have him!

300
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:54,457
Heh. You can ramble about
friendship all day long.

301
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:57,627
But you still won't be
able to keep up with me!

302
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:06,177
[LUCK] You're going to die
by your comrade's hands!

303
00:19:09,806 --> 00:19:10,890
[gasps]

304
00:19:12,392 --> 00:19:15,020
[LUCK] A human shouldn't
be able to match my speed!

305
00:19:21,443 --> 00:19:22,610
[yells]

306
00:19:24,738 --> 00:19:25,905
[ASTA growls]

307
00:19:30,326 --> 00:19:31,953
How's that possible?

308
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:33,496
Your ki is so full of rage

309
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,749
that I can read it
loud and clear!

310
00:19:35,832 --> 00:19:38,084
And this blade'll follow
you anywhere you go,

311
00:19:38,168 --> 00:19:41,171
it can't resist powerful
magic like yours!

312
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:46,885
[LUCK]
Now I'm annoyed!

313
00:19:54,225 --> 00:19:58,021
I'm actually impressed! But...

314
00:20:00,523 --> 00:20:05,695
[LUCK] It's no use.
You're no match for my anger!

315
00:20:05,779 --> 00:20:07,489
[grunts] Oh, crap!

316
00:20:07,572 --> 00:20:08,948
[LUCK yells]

317
00:20:09,032 --> 00:20:11,701
[cackling]

318
00:20:11,785 --> 00:20:13,286
[ASTA] He shouldn't
be able to detect me,

319
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:16,289
but his combat sense
is off the charts!

320
00:20:16,373 --> 00:20:17,749
Hey, Magna and Vanessa,

321
00:20:17,832 --> 00:20:20,001
could you guys give me
some backup over here?

322
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:21,419
[MAGNA]
You bet!

323
00:20:22,671 --> 00:20:25,006
[LUCK chuckles]

324
00:20:26,675 --> 00:20:28,218
[LUCK] What makes you
think your attacks

325
00:20:28,301 --> 00:20:31,888
will affect me now?
Not only that.

326
00:20:35,392 --> 00:20:38,978
This time, I've got a handle
on how fast you are!

327
00:20:39,062 --> 00:20:40,855
Asta, no!

328
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:43,733
[ASTA]
I can't hold out for long.

329
00:20:43,817 --> 00:20:46,027
Better make this count!

330
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:49,948
I've already beat you.
You can stop now.

331
00:20:50,031 --> 00:20:52,325
[yells]

332
00:20:54,077 --> 00:20:55,203
[LUCK]
He's got no magic,

333
00:20:55,286 --> 00:20:57,789
so their plan is to
hide him from me?

334
00:20:57,872 --> 00:21:01,918
Fine, then. I'll spread out
my mana in all directions

335
00:21:02,002 --> 00:21:05,296
until I detect the moment
his weapon interrupts it.

336
00:21:07,424 --> 00:21:10,885
[LUCK] Found him, and he's
headed straight for me.

337
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:12,971
He can't escape now.

338
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:17,892
[LUCK]
My rage overpowers everything!

339
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:19,060
[LUCK giggles]

340
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:21,521
[LUCK]
There you are!

341
00:21:21,604 --> 00:21:23,106
[VANESSA]
Do it!

342
00:21:23,189 --> 00:21:24,566
[MAGNA]
Here goes!

343
00:21:26,317 --> 00:21:27,694
Huh?

344
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:33,158
[LUCK]
They messed up my timing!

345
00:21:33,241 --> 00:21:34,784
Now!

346
00:21:34,868 --> 00:21:37,287
He's wide open!

347
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:40,665
[ASTA] You're strong,
but our bond is stronger!

348
00:21:40,749 --> 00:21:42,542
You lose!

349
00:21:44,419 --> 00:21:46,463
[LUCK groans]

350
00:21:46,546 --> 00:21:48,631
[BOTH]
Nice goin', Asta!

351
00:21:51,634 --> 00:21:53,678
Let's get you outta there!

352
00:21:58,475 --> 00:22:00,727
[ASTA]
He's got so much power left!

353
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:05,607
You humans are doomed.
Just wait and see!

354
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:07,984
You really don't know
when to throw in the towel,

355
00:22:08,068 --> 00:22:09,152
do ya, punk?

356
00:22:09,235 --> 00:22:11,404
We're not going to
give up on our friend!

357
00:22:11,488 --> 00:22:13,031
We told you!

358
00:22:17,285 --> 00:22:18,703
[LUCK]
Stop it.

359
00:22:20,246 --> 00:22:23,958
[LUCK]
Get your hands off me!

360
00:23:57,052 --> 00:23:59,095
[VANESSA] Luck, you're my
precious little brother!

361
00:23:59,179 --> 00:24:00,805
Hurry up and come back
so you can tease

362
00:24:00,889 --> 00:24:03,767
Magna and eat people's
pudding without permission!

363
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:07,479
<i>Black Clover</i> ,
Page 105: "Smiles, Tears."

364
00:24:07,562 --> 00:24:10,940
I'm not letting anything
tear the Black Bulls apart!
