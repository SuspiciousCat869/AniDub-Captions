Threatened by a ruthless demon,

humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:24,416
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,166
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

After his triumph, he was hailed

[MARS]
Tell me, boy. What are you?

12
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,500
I am...

13
00:01:24,583 --> 00:01:25,791
I'm somebody who was born

00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:28,333
without a single drop
of magic power.

And I'm still gonna
be the Wizard King.

I'll fight and bleed
all I have to.

that I can do it!

[MARS]
I...

21
00:01:50,541 --> 00:01:52,791
I live only to destroy!

That's why you live, to destroy?

23
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:56,166
Well, the Wizard King lives

24
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,916
to protect his kingdom
and his people!

25

[FANA] We'll keep everyone
in the country safe.

You're in my way.

Begone, pebble!

Sure, I might be
a pebble, but if so,

32
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:24,625
I'm going to be the pebble
that shatters the diamond!

[ASTA] You sure that Binding

Are you questioning
the strength of my magic?

38
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:46,125
It's a sturdy spell that won't
be broken by an injured mage.

39
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:48,333
Plus, I have his grimoire.

Okay, okay, defensive much?

41
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,333
Here. Have some. It's good.

42
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:54,666
I don't want your
half-chewed leftovers.

Yuno?

44
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:58,625
I think I'll pass.

45
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:02,291
I'm so relieved that none of us
were seriously injured.

46

Are you sure you should be
up and about already?

Oh, yes, it's fine.

48
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:06,958
I'm mostly healed by now.

49
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:09,875
I have you to thank for
protecting me so valiantly.

50
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:12,333
No. I didn't do
anything special.

51
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:15,750
I just couldn't leave a dimwit
like you to fend for herself.

Well, you have my gratitude.

Fine, whatever.

55
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:23,958
something about
yourself already?

00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,541
Jeez, what am I doin'
wrong this time?

57
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:29,000
Just look at the
way you're dressed!

58
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:31,625
So why are you blushing
when I'm the one half-naked?

59
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:34,625
Don't be ridiculous.
I am not blushing.

My robe, though.
Aw, just look at it.

The poor thing got
seriously torn up.

kill me for this.

[LUCK] Vanessa'll fix it
up when we get back.

You think she can?

65
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,125
It's in really bad shape.

Mm-hm! Mm-hm!

Shameful.

I still cannot believe
we needed the assistance

of the Black Bulls.

As I was certain we would,

71

we arrived here first,

and thus, are the winners
of the competition.

73

However, this once,
I will allow you

74
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:08,666
to accompany us into
the treasure hall.

Come on, Four-Eyes,

76

could you be any more
high and mighty?!

Thank you so very much,
you enormous jerk!

You're welcome,
and shut your mouth

00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,416
before it gets you in trouble.

Oh, have I upset you,
Sir Spectacles?

I'm terribly sorry.

82
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:21,958
I would chastise you for that,

the time for petty,

86

I beg your forgiveness!

involved, we're committed.

Now that is taking it too far.

[ASTA] Oh, I'll show ya
too far, Four-Eyes.

to the treasure hall!

Whatever's hidden in there,
we're gonna claim it

in the name of the Clover
Kingdom's Magic Knights!

You're one to talk, loudmouth.

96

[ASTA, KLAUS]
So... How do we get in?

97
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:04,291
There's probably a
cipher here somewhere

98
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:06,083
that will allow us
to open the door.

99
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:07,583
Go on and find it, Four-Eyes.

100

[KLAUS] Be quiet!
And it's not Four-Eyes.

Hm.

Looks like it's made of magic,

00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:19,333
so you should be able
to slice right through.

Flame Recovery Magic? But how?

170
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:39,166
Each mage can have only
one magic attribute.

171
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:43,791
The four elements:
fire, wind, water, earth.

172
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:46,375
A mage is imbued with
mana from one of these.

173
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:49,250
The attributes interact
in specific ways.

00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:52,083
Fire is strong against
wind but weak to water.

175
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:54,458
It is a known law that
a mage can only use

176
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:57,250
one kind of magic stemming
from one of these attributes

177
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,041
or its derivatives.

178
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:02,291
[KLAUS]
Yet, in defiance of that law,

179
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:05,375
he can wield two types of magic.

180
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,166
And, while he clearly
commands attack magic,

181
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,666
he can cast recovery
spells, too?

182
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,583

that looks quite warm.

324
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:25,666
It is.

325
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:32,875
And also rather heavy.

326
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,833
Very heavy.

327
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:41,541
What's more, if my face
itches, I can't scratch it.

328
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:43,166
[KLAUS]
Hm.

329
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,666
[MARS] Only those who
are strong will survive.

330
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,500
The weak deserve to die.

331
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:52,250
Pebbles that will be
ground into gravel

332
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:54,000
and scattered by the wind.

333
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:57,916
<i>Black Clover</i> , page 19:
"Destruction and Salvation."

334
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,708
My magic will destroy all.
