1
00:00:23,763 --> 00:00:25,724
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:25,807 --> 00:00:28,601
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:32,063 --> 00:00:34,399
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:34,482 --> 00:00:37,068
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:45,577
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,664
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:54,794
[NARRATOR] The elves reborn
as Golden Dawn mages

8
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:57,047
descended upon the castle.

9
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:59,799
Meanwhile, the Eye of
the Midnight Sun's base

10
00:00:59,883 --> 00:01:02,761
arrived at the capital,
carrying Licht and Rhya.

11
00:01:02,844 --> 00:01:04,471
[YAMI] Who the hell thought
it'd be a good idea

12
00:01:04,554 --> 00:01:07,515
to invite the giant floating
boulder to the party?

13
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:11,561
But, look, a pretty little
birdie just showed up, too.

14
00:01:11,644 --> 00:01:12,937
[NARRATOR]
Nozel and Noelle met up

15
00:01:13,021 --> 00:01:15,148
with Yami's group
for a brief moment,

16
00:01:15,231 --> 00:01:16,983
then all the knights went
their separate ways

17
00:01:17,067 --> 00:01:20,362
in order to protect the people
of the Clover Kingdom.

18
00:01:20,445 --> 00:01:22,447
However, when the
Silvas returned

19
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,283
to their childhood residence,
they were forced to contend

20
00:01:25,367 --> 00:01:28,203
with the enemy's devastating
Compass Magic.

21
00:01:28,286 --> 00:01:30,121
Just when all seemed lost,

22
00:01:30,205 --> 00:01:32,749
Noelle combined everything
she'd learned from her training

23
00:01:32,832 --> 00:01:35,168
and experience as a
member of the Black Bulls

24
00:01:35,251 --> 00:01:38,213
with her resolute desire
to rescue her siblings

25
00:01:38,296 --> 00:01:41,299
and gained an awe-inspiring
new power.

26
00:01:41,383 --> 00:01:45,053
[NOELLE] I'll crush you
and this world you've made!

27
00:03:23,651 --> 00:03:26,321
[ALECDORA] Blow it away,
and it comes right back.

28
00:03:26,404 --> 00:03:28,156
Human magic.

29
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,492
It's so impertinent.

30
00:03:33,244 --> 00:03:36,456
They've invaded the third level
and the inner courtyard, too.

31
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:40,710
So the safest, and therefore
loveliest, route is...

32
00:03:42,253 --> 00:03:43,421
...that way.

33
00:03:43,505 --> 00:03:45,507
Everyone, please hurry outside!

34
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:48,051
We're so lucky you
arrived in time.

35
00:03:48,134 --> 00:03:50,136
Yes, you saved us!

36
00:03:51,221 --> 00:03:54,808
Well, this is the esteemed
Vermillion residence, after all.

37
00:03:54,891 --> 00:03:57,644
Which means the terrain is
completely in our favor!

38
00:03:57,727 --> 00:03:59,062
And look!

39
00:03:59,145 --> 00:04:01,648
My beautiful Cherry Blossom
Magic confuses the enemy

40
00:04:01,731 --> 00:04:04,317
while concealing our
allies' whereabouts!

41
00:04:04,401 --> 00:04:07,404
Plus, the Fungus Magic secreted
by those shriveled spores

42
00:04:07,487 --> 00:04:10,448
helps to muddle any
attempts to locate us.

43
00:04:10,532 --> 00:04:13,535
And of course, my sister
Mimosa's using her Plant Magic

44
00:04:13,618 --> 00:04:16,913
to survey the surroundings
and guide our path.

45
00:04:16,996 --> 00:04:18,373
All of our enchanting techniques

46
00:04:18,456 --> 00:04:20,792
are perfectly suited
to evacuation!

47
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:22,877
And with no violence necessary!

48
00:04:22,961 --> 00:04:24,379
How gorgeous!

49
00:04:24,462 --> 00:04:26,548
Would you please stop talking
before you blow our cover,

50
00:04:26,631 --> 00:04:29,217
you loudmouthed buffoon?

51
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,468
[MIMOSA]
They're only our enemies because

52
00:04:30,552 --> 00:04:32,762
they're possessed
by elf spirits.

53
00:04:32,846 --> 00:04:35,432
Deep down, they're
still our squadmates.

54
00:04:35,515 --> 00:04:37,225
I swear, we'll do
everything possible

55
00:04:37,308 --> 00:04:39,602
to bring them back to normal!

56
00:04:39,686 --> 00:04:42,022
Hey there. Workin' hard, huh?

57
00:04:42,105 --> 00:04:43,189
[MIMOSA gasps]

58
00:04:43,273 --> 00:04:44,607
[MIMOSA]
David!

59
00:04:45,608 --> 00:04:48,611
Nope. Sorry, my name's Baval.

60
00:04:48,695 --> 00:04:51,448
[KIRSCH] I didn't notice
his presence at all!

61
00:04:51,531 --> 00:04:55,118
[EN] If he found us, that must
mean our spells aren't working.

62
00:04:55,201 --> 00:04:59,122
Relax. Why do you guys
look so angry?

63
00:04:59,205 --> 00:05:00,623
Sorry for bargin' in,

64
00:05:00,707 --> 00:05:03,001
but all I wanted to do
was track you guys down

65
00:05:03,084 --> 00:05:04,586
and say a quick hello.

66
00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:07,297
If I was trying to kill you,
then you would already be dead.

67
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,091
So there's no reason
to get all defensive.

68
00:05:10,175 --> 00:05:12,344
[MIMOSA] I don't think
that's all he wants.

69
00:05:12,427 --> 00:05:14,512
Tell us what you're
really after, elf!

70
00:05:14,596 --> 00:05:16,306
Oh, not much,

71
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:18,600
but I can catch you
up on the details.

72
00:05:18,683 --> 00:05:19,768
If you haven't figured it out,

73
00:05:19,851 --> 00:05:21,561
my friends and I have
been reincarnated

74
00:05:21,644 --> 00:05:23,980
with much stronger
magic than you possess.

75
00:05:24,064 --> 00:05:26,983
And now we've come here
to pay the royals a visit.

76
00:05:27,067 --> 00:05:29,235
You can sense it too, right?

77
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:32,197
You know, the fact that
something even more powerful

78
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,532
is heading over
here as we speak.

79
00:05:34,616 --> 00:05:36,826
Not much point
evacuating the castle.

80
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:39,913
Either way, you're
all going to die.

81
00:05:39,996 --> 00:05:42,791
So you might as well
surrender at this point.

82
00:05:42,874 --> 00:05:46,252
I'm pretty formidable, but the
rest of us are tough as well.

83
00:05:46,336 --> 00:05:48,838
Man, this takes me back.

84
00:05:48,922 --> 00:05:50,632
I can't wait to see everybody.

85
00:05:50,715 --> 00:05:52,967
I won't let you hurt
anyone else!

86
00:05:53,051 --> 00:05:54,928
We'll defeat you,
no matter what!

87
00:05:55,011 --> 00:05:59,099
I do admire your determination,
but it's too late now.

88
00:05:59,182 --> 00:06:00,517
Once we take care of your king,

89
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,353
this invasion's as
good as over with.

90
00:06:03,436 --> 00:06:05,355
We sent one of our
most qualified people

91
00:06:05,438 --> 00:06:06,815
to deal with him, too.

92
00:06:06,898 --> 00:06:10,527
Believe me, the guy's as
stubborn as he is twisted.

93
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:13,113
King Clover's
trapped like a rat.

94
00:06:13,196 --> 00:06:14,614
Oh, and...

95
00:06:14,698 --> 00:06:16,991
...our guy has something
particularly nasty

96
00:06:17,075 --> 00:06:18,243
up his sleeve.

97
00:06:18,326 --> 00:06:20,537
Perfect magic for
killing a king.

98
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,415
[gasping]

99
00:06:23,498 --> 00:06:24,916
[groaning]

100
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,377
[LEDIOR] I don't have what it
takes to stop that spell.

101
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,546
How's he this powerful?

102
00:06:30,547 --> 00:06:31,965
Ingrate!

103
00:06:32,048 --> 00:06:34,843
How dare you come in here
and disgrace this sacred hall!

104
00:06:34,926 --> 00:06:37,053
[gasps] Langris, dear!

105
00:06:37,137 --> 00:06:38,388
What's wrong?!

106
00:06:38,471 --> 00:06:41,182
Heh. This is the current king?

107
00:06:41,266 --> 00:06:43,018
He looks so seedy.

108
00:06:43,101 --> 00:06:44,436
What?!

109
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:47,105
I will not abide such disrespect
in my royal presence!

110
00:06:47,188 --> 00:06:51,401
You should be ashamed to have
this traitorous rebel for a son!

111
00:06:51,484 --> 00:06:52,444
Please, sir!

112
00:06:52,527 --> 00:06:54,571
This has to be a
misunderstanding!

113
00:06:54,654 --> 00:06:56,156
Yes, something's wrong!

114
00:06:56,239 --> 00:06:59,075
Our precious son Langris would
never betray the Clover Kingdom!

115
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:00,410
[KING CLOVER]
Silence!

116
00:07:00,493 --> 00:07:02,078
With all of our
defenses outside,

117
00:07:02,162 --> 00:07:04,831
how could that scoundrel have
weaseled his way in here?

118
00:07:04,914 --> 00:07:06,875
I swear, Julius and
the other Magic Knights

119
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:09,210
are positively useless!

120
00:07:09,294 --> 00:07:11,129
You have left me no choice!

121
00:07:11,212 --> 00:07:14,507
Now I'll show you my magic!

122
00:07:15,925 --> 00:07:17,302
[KING CLOVER laughing]

123
00:07:17,385 --> 00:07:21,014
Here! Behold the magnificent
talent of a king!

124
00:07:21,097 --> 00:07:24,225
I see you're too busy
trembling to escape!

125
00:07:24,309 --> 00:07:27,937
My Light Magic!

126
00:07:28,021 --> 00:07:31,858
Absolute Monarch
of Divine Brilliance!

127
00:07:33,651 --> 00:07:37,322
What say you?! Positively
godlike, is it not?!

128
00:07:37,405 --> 00:07:41,368
Bow down and grovel
before my royal visage!

129
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:46,581
[KING CLOVER]
What?! What did you do?!

130
00:07:46,664 --> 00:07:50,627
How sad. That spell was
ridiculously sluggish.

131
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:52,712
I won't kill you just yet.

132
00:07:52,796 --> 00:07:54,047
Let's start with your legs.

133
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:55,507
[whimpers]

134
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:58,635
No, wait! Langris!

135
00:07:58,718 --> 00:07:59,928
[FINNES gasps]

136
00:08:01,554 --> 00:08:03,807
You can't do this,
you know it's not right!

137
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:06,101
[coughing]

138
00:08:06,184 --> 00:08:07,560
If you go through with it,

139
00:08:07,644 --> 00:08:10,021
you and a lot of other
people will be hurt.

140
00:08:10,105 --> 00:08:12,148
People who care
about you very much.

141
00:08:12,232 --> 00:08:13,483
So, please...

142
00:08:13,566 --> 00:08:15,527
Shut your mouth.

143
00:08:19,155 --> 00:08:20,949
[LANGRIS]
Your kind killed the elves,

144
00:08:21,032 --> 00:08:24,619
and you have the nerve
to talk about being hurt?

145
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:28,873
[FINRAL panting]

146
00:08:28,957 --> 00:08:31,543
Langris, no!

147
00:08:34,254 --> 00:08:35,964
[FINRAL grunts]

148
00:08:42,804 --> 00:08:45,557
Please tell me he didn't
injure you, Miss Finnes.

149
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,225
No, I'm fine.

150
00:08:47,308 --> 00:08:48,893
Finral's here.

151
00:08:48,977 --> 00:08:51,438
I'm sorry, who are you?

152
00:08:52,856 --> 00:08:55,775
Your brother! Wake up!

153
00:08:55,859 --> 00:08:58,695
[YAMI] Stop tryin' to
act like a hero, Finral.

154
00:08:58,778 --> 00:09:02,240
[FINRAL chuckles]
I wasn't, though! Really.

155
00:09:02,323 --> 00:09:05,035
How'd they manage to
get past our forces?

156
00:09:05,118 --> 00:09:06,828
[YAMI]
Oh, those other glowin' guys?

157
00:09:06,911 --> 00:09:09,414
Yeah, we took care
of 'em already.

158
00:09:09,497 --> 00:09:11,666
But it woulda gone a
lot faster if Skinny here

159
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,001
had been on the ball.

160
00:09:13,084 --> 00:09:14,252
'Scuse me?

161
00:09:14,336 --> 00:09:16,796
You were the one goofing
around the whole time.

162
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,798
Friggin' meathead.

163
00:09:18,882 --> 00:09:20,592
[JACK cackles]
You shouldn't have

164
00:09:20,675 --> 00:09:22,552
split up your forces, elf-boy.

165
00:09:22,635 --> 00:09:25,347
Because you don't stand a
chance against us on your own.

166
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:28,016
[LANGRIS]
Heh. I'm not worried.

167
00:09:28,099 --> 00:09:29,559
Care to explain how
you overpowered

168
00:09:29,642 --> 00:09:32,187
that many by yourselves?

169
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:34,147
Why don't we show ya?

170
00:09:36,107 --> 00:09:37,817
[YAMI]
You can't counter this.

171
00:09:37,901 --> 00:09:39,152
[JACK]
It's too late!

172
00:09:39,235 --> 00:09:40,236
Heh.

173
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,488
[YAMI gasps]

174
00:09:41,571 --> 00:09:42,572
[JACK grunts]

175
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,865
[BOTH gasp]

176
00:09:45,241 --> 00:09:47,535
I'm sorry. I should've
warned you before.

177
00:09:47,619 --> 00:09:51,706
This spell I'm using
retaliates automatically.

178
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,583
Give me a challenge, would you?

179
00:09:53,667 --> 00:09:55,585
I'm bored.

180
00:09:55,669 --> 00:09:57,837
[BOTH]
We can do that.

181
00:10:06,346 --> 00:10:08,890
[LEDIOR]
His abilities are unbelievable!

182
00:10:08,973 --> 00:10:11,142
There's no Spatial mage
in the whole kingdom

183
00:10:11,226 --> 00:10:14,604
who can cancel out
a spell like that.

184
00:10:14,688 --> 00:10:16,773
It's an extremely
protective shield,

185
00:10:16,856 --> 00:10:20,068
and he can keep it
going constantly.

186
00:10:20,151 --> 00:10:21,111
[FINRAL]
Father.

187
00:10:21,194 --> 00:10:22,320
Miss Finnes.

188
00:10:22,404 --> 00:10:24,614
You should run away and
let us deal with this.

189
00:10:24,698 --> 00:10:25,949
[BOTH gasp]

190
00:10:26,032 --> 00:10:27,283
You fool!

191
00:10:27,367 --> 00:10:29,494
You're merely a transport
for the Black Bulls,

192
00:10:29,577 --> 00:10:30,578
you can't defeat him!

193
00:10:30,662 --> 00:10:33,540
I may not be able
to do any damage,

194
00:10:33,623 --> 00:10:37,293
and he may be the vice captain
of the Golden Dawn,

195
00:10:37,377 --> 00:10:40,839
but all that matters
to me right now

196
00:10:40,922 --> 00:10:43,633
is that Langris and
I are brothers!

197
00:10:43,717 --> 00:10:45,093
[gasps]

198
00:10:45,176 --> 00:10:47,429
He's lost his mind.

199
00:10:48,555 --> 00:10:51,349
Don't you go underestimatin'
my wheels, mister.

200
00:10:51,433 --> 00:10:53,560
Uh, what--? But I--

201
00:10:53,643 --> 00:10:55,687
Look, pal, you're in the way.

202
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:57,313
I'll throw you in there myself.

203
00:10:57,397 --> 00:10:59,024
[LEDIOR screams]

204
00:10:59,107 --> 00:11:02,027
Oh, Langris.
My precious Langris!

205
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:05,113
[YAMI] All right, you're
goin' in there with him.

206
00:11:05,196 --> 00:11:06,489
[LILIANE]
Langris!

207
00:11:06,573 --> 00:11:09,075
[coughs] I'm worried, Finral.

208
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:11,161
Promise me you'll
come back alive.

209
00:11:11,244 --> 00:11:14,414
[FINRAL] Sure, and I'll
bring Langris with me.

210
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:18,752
[sighs]

211
00:11:18,835 --> 00:11:22,797
[KING CLOVER] Wait!
I should be first priority!

212
00:11:22,881 --> 00:11:24,841
[FINRAL]
Huh? Oh...

213
00:11:26,176 --> 00:11:28,762
Honestly, you're
such a useless lot.

214
00:11:28,845 --> 00:11:30,055
[yelps]

215
00:11:30,138 --> 00:11:32,807
What's the hurry?
You should stick around.

216
00:11:32,891 --> 00:11:35,518
I was just getting ready
to mutilate His Majesty.

217
00:11:35,602 --> 00:11:36,895
I won't let you.

218
00:11:36,978 --> 00:11:37,937
[cackles]

219
00:11:38,021 --> 00:11:39,898
This kid talks a big game.

220
00:11:39,981 --> 00:11:42,400
I'll cut him down to size.

221
00:11:44,194 --> 00:11:46,988
[JACK]
Severing Magic: Death Scythe.

222
00:11:47,072 --> 00:11:49,407
Lunatic Slash.

223
00:11:52,619 --> 00:11:53,912
[gasps]

224
00:11:54,954 --> 00:11:56,247
[KING CLOVER screams]

225
00:11:56,331 --> 00:11:58,124
You moronic mantis!

226
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:00,627
[FINRAL]
That's one way to save someone.

227
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,253
He's the king, you know!

228
00:12:02,337 --> 00:12:05,298
[cackles] You interfered
with my slashes.

229
00:12:05,382 --> 00:12:07,133
Not too shabby, pal.

230
00:12:07,217 --> 00:12:09,594
[FINRAL] Never mind,
he's already moved on.

231
00:12:09,678 --> 00:12:11,012
[LANGRIS]
Heh. Still think you can

232
00:12:11,096 --> 00:12:14,391
hold a candle to my strength?

233
00:12:14,474 --> 00:12:17,143
It's time for you filth
to learn your place!

234
00:12:17,227 --> 00:12:18,186
[JACK growls]

235
00:12:18,269 --> 00:12:19,521
[YAMI]
He can use his attack spells

236
00:12:19,604 --> 00:12:21,981
without turning off
that defensive shield?

237
00:12:22,065 --> 00:12:23,858
Not gonna fight fair, are ya?

238
00:12:23,942 --> 00:12:27,237
If this spell hits you even
one time, you'll be dead.

239
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,697
[LANGRIS]
Spatial Magic...

240
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,073
[FINRAL]
Spatial Magic...

241
00:12:30,156 --> 00:12:32,534
[LANGRIS]
Archangel's Crash!

242
00:12:32,617 --> 00:12:34,911
Fallen Angel's Wingbeat!

243
00:12:36,663 --> 00:12:37,914
[FINRAL grunts]

244
00:12:37,997 --> 00:12:39,958
[FINRAL] The difference
in our power's too great!

245
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:42,794
I can only block about
half of these things!

246
00:12:42,877 --> 00:12:45,463
Avoid them however you can!

247
00:12:46,464 --> 00:12:49,092
Hey, who said you could
start barkin' orders?

248
00:12:49,175 --> 00:12:51,886
[YAMI]
Dark Magic: Black Hole!

249
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,221
[JACK cackling]

250
00:12:53,304 --> 00:12:57,308
[JACK] Reinforcement Magic:
Leg Strength Boost!

251
00:12:58,601 --> 00:13:03,273
[YAMI] Dark Magic:
Dark Cloaked Lightless Slash!

252
00:13:04,816 --> 00:13:06,484
Yami!

253
00:13:08,528 --> 00:13:10,405
Thanks for that.

254
00:13:10,488 --> 00:13:12,657
[FINRAL grunts]

255
00:13:12,741 --> 00:13:14,117
Huh?

256
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,161
[YAMI] If we want to land
even a scratch on this guy,

257
00:13:16,244 --> 00:13:19,414
we're gonna have to do
somethin' about that barrier.

258
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:23,376
[YAMI] But he's constantly
throwin' his orbs at us,

259
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:28,298
and Finral's magic can only
cancel out so many of 'em.

260
00:13:28,381 --> 00:13:30,884
A long battle puts us
at a disadvantage,

261
00:13:30,967 --> 00:13:33,553
so we need to end this
thing nice and quick.

262
00:13:33,636 --> 00:13:34,971
[YAMI grunts]

263
00:13:35,597 --> 00:13:37,390
[YAMI]
Which means...

264
00:13:38,433 --> 00:13:39,642
[growls]

265
00:13:39,726 --> 00:13:41,019
[YAMI]
It'll take more than one of us

266
00:13:41,102 --> 00:13:43,188
attackin' him at the same time.

267
00:13:43,271 --> 00:13:46,274
I can cover this side myself.

268
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:49,402
[JACK] I haven't had prey
like this in a while.

269
00:13:49,486 --> 00:13:52,989
Ooh. I want to slice
him up so bad!

270
00:13:53,073 --> 00:13:55,533
You're mine now!

271
00:13:56,242 --> 00:13:58,078
[NARRATOR]
Using his instinctual ability

272
00:13:58,161 --> 00:14:01,206
to transform the very
nature of his magic,

273
00:14:01,289 --> 00:14:03,875
Jack's ferocious blades
are able to cut through

274
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:05,835
practically any type of spell.

275
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:09,422
All because his desire to
slash things is so intense.

276
00:14:09,506 --> 00:14:11,424
[JACK]
Here you go!

277
00:14:12,801 --> 00:14:15,220
[NARRATOR] Even though Spatial
Magic has unique properties

278
00:14:15,303 --> 00:14:19,057
of its own, he can cut his way
through it just the same.

279
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,309
[growls] But how?

280
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:26,523
Well, well. That scrawny psycho
came in handy after all.

281
00:14:26,606 --> 00:14:28,274
[JACK]
Severing Magic...

282
00:14:28,358 --> 00:14:30,235
Now, Dark Magic...

283
00:14:30,318 --> 00:14:32,112
Dark Cloaked...

284
00:14:32,195 --> 00:14:33,321
Ready, Jack?

285
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:34,531
[JACK]
Ready!

286
00:14:34,614 --> 00:14:36,116
Death Scythe!

287
00:14:36,199 --> 00:14:38,785
[YAMI]
Dimension Slash!

288
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,664
[gasping]

289
00:14:42,747 --> 00:14:44,124
[JACK cackling]

290
00:14:44,207 --> 00:14:45,250
Hmph.

291
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,419
All right!

292
00:14:48,962 --> 00:14:50,338
[JACK grunts]

293
00:14:56,219 --> 00:14:57,637
Damn.

294
00:14:57,721 --> 00:15:00,348
[LANGRIS] I was surprised when
they eliminated my shield,

295
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:02,600
but they're still
one step behind.

296
00:15:03,727 --> 00:15:05,228
[LANGRIS laughs]

297
00:15:05,311 --> 00:15:07,147
[LANGRIS] Looks like your
Spatial Magic is worthless

298
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:09,399
for attacking and defending!

299
00:15:09,482 --> 00:15:13,361
[FINRAL] My power can't
actually defeat anybody.

300
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:14,487
[FINRAL groans]

301
00:15:14,571 --> 00:15:15,947
[FINRAL]
But...

302
00:15:17,365 --> 00:15:19,909
[LANGRIS]
I'll send you to oblivion.

303
00:15:19,993 --> 00:15:23,329
[FINRAL] Spatial Magic:
Fallen Angel's Wingbeat!

304
00:15:24,998 --> 00:15:26,624
What the--?

305
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:29,836
[LANGRIS] He dropped his guard
so he could transport them?

306
00:15:33,173 --> 00:15:34,674
[FINRAL]
My Fallen Angel's Wingbeat

307
00:15:34,758 --> 00:15:39,179
can forcibly transport a person
from one location to another.

308
00:15:39,262 --> 00:15:43,350
I'm gonna save my friends,
and you, too!

309
00:15:43,433 --> 00:15:45,226
Heh!

310
00:15:46,394 --> 00:15:49,481
Well, I hate to break it
to you, human. You're fast.

311
00:15:49,564 --> 00:15:52,233
But I'm just a
little bit faster!

312
00:15:52,317 --> 00:15:55,445
I'll kill all of you in one go!

313
00:15:55,528 --> 00:15:58,656
[FINRAL] It's fine, these guys
are Magic Knight Captains.

314
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,826
If anyone can win
this fight, it's them!

315
00:16:04,871 --> 00:16:06,623
[gasps]

316
00:16:06,706 --> 00:16:10,794
[JACK] The more I use them,
the quicker my blades become!

317
00:16:10,877 --> 00:16:12,128
[YAMI]
All right, kid.

318
00:16:12,212 --> 00:16:14,047
Time for a nap.

00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:15,674
I've got just the thing.

00:16:20,887 --> 00:16:22,514

[YAMI grunts]

324
00:16:24,891 --> 00:16:26,685
[LANGRIS]
How could you beat me?

325
00:16:26,768 --> 00:16:31,481
When you're just... human trash!

326
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:35,402
[LANGRIS]
I hate your kind.

327
00:16:35,485 --> 00:16:38,738
All of you are so filthy,
petty, and repulsive!

[ALL gasp]

329
00:16:40,573 --> 00:16:43,201

Just disappear!

330
00:16:43,284 --> 00:16:46,913
[cackles] He finally lost
the rest of his marbles.

331
00:16:46,996 --> 00:16:48,248
[YAMI]
This mana.

332
00:16:48,331 --> 00:16:51,376
It feels even more sinister
than it did earlier.

333
00:16:51,459 --> 00:16:55,422
Great! What the hell are we
s'posed to do with him now?

334
00:16:55,505 --> 00:16:59,134
[FINRAL panting]

335
00:16:59,217 --> 00:17:03,346
[FINRAL] Nothing.
It's over at this point.

336
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:04,931
He's too far gone.

337
00:17:05,015 --> 00:17:07,183
My magic is so insignificant
compared to his,

338
00:17:07,267 --> 00:17:09,185
he won't even notice it.

339
00:17:09,269 --> 00:17:11,980
[panting]

340
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:14,482
[FINRAL]
Langris.

341
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:17,819
When I think about it,
we never actually argued.

342
00:17:17,902 --> 00:17:20,572
Not since we were children.

343
00:17:20,655 --> 00:17:22,866
I always ran away instead.

344
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:25,869
Using my lack of
talent as an excuse.

345
00:17:25,952 --> 00:17:28,329
Even though I'm
the older brother,

346
00:17:28,413 --> 00:17:31,958
and I knew how lonely
you were feeling.

347
00:17:32,042 --> 00:17:36,546
This is... my last chance!

348
00:17:36,629 --> 00:17:38,131
Your big brother really shines

349
00:17:38,214 --> 00:17:42,135
when it comes to
speed and accuracy.

350
00:17:42,218 --> 00:17:45,430
So I'll stop you,
whatever it takes!

351
00:17:48,683 --> 00:17:50,685
I hope you're ready.

352
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:52,979
Wake up!

353
00:17:53,063 --> 00:17:54,230
[LANGRIS grunts]

354
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:58,401
[FINRAL]
Langris... Langris...

355
00:17:58,485 --> 00:17:59,944
Langris!

356
00:18:00,028 --> 00:18:01,821
Listen to me!

357
00:18:04,574 --> 00:18:06,826
[FINRAL] For being the
gifted younger brother,

358
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:09,537
you're kind of a
handful, aren't you?

359
00:18:11,498 --> 00:18:13,375
[FINRAL]
Sorry it took so long.

360
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:16,336
I'm not really good
at this stuff.

361
00:18:16,419 --> 00:18:18,421
Come with me.

362
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:38,108
That's real cute.

363
00:18:38,191 --> 00:18:39,401
We do all the grunt work

364
00:18:39,484 --> 00:18:41,361
and you save the day
with your brotherly love.

365
00:18:41,444 --> 00:18:43,196
[cackles]

366
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:47,075
Good job, Finral. You did it.

367
00:18:49,744 --> 00:18:52,247
[YAMI]
But the big question is...

368
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:54,416
What's their endgame here?

369
00:18:54,499 --> 00:18:57,919
Just wipe out humanity
and call it a day?

370
00:18:58,003 --> 00:19:02,882
No, I think they've got
somethin' else up their sleeve.

371
00:19:03,967 --> 00:19:05,885
[PATRY]
It won't be long now, Licht.

372
00:19:05,969 --> 00:19:07,971
Soon, I'll get to see you awake.

373
00:19:08,054 --> 00:19:09,472
[gasps]

374
00:19:13,393 --> 00:19:16,938
[PATRY] Did the two of you
just get here, as well?

375
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:18,523
Who's he, Brother?

376
00:19:18,606 --> 00:19:21,067
That isn't Licht.

377
00:19:21,151 --> 00:19:23,069
You're Patry.

378
00:19:23,153 --> 00:19:24,821
I know that you always
looked up to Licht,

379
00:19:24,904 --> 00:19:28,366
but now you've copied his
appearance and everything.

380
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:30,535
What do you mean
"copied" him?

381
00:19:30,618 --> 00:19:34,456
It wasn't my choice. I was
in this body when I awoke.

382
00:19:34,539 --> 00:19:37,083
I suppose you could
call it my destiny.

383
00:19:37,167 --> 00:19:39,336
Wow. That's creepy.

384
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:40,837
Hey!

385
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,840
Droit! It's been a
long time, hasn't it?

386
00:19:43,923 --> 00:19:46,384
I was just awakened, actually.

387
00:19:46,468 --> 00:19:49,179
So it doesn't feel like
it's been very long to me.

388
00:19:49,262 --> 00:19:53,600
[laughs] Good point. And how
are you, little Eclat?

389
00:19:53,683 --> 00:19:55,101
Hello, sir.

390
00:19:55,185 --> 00:19:57,479
[PATRY]
Rhya, where is Licht right now?

391
00:19:57,562 --> 00:20:01,900
Oh. Patry's here, too, eh?
Licht's using a fake body.

392
00:20:01,983 --> 00:20:04,152
So it's either because of that,
or because he's the one

393
00:20:04,235 --> 00:20:07,447
who activated the forbidden
reincarnation spell.

394
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:10,033
But his memories haven't
completely come back yet,

395
00:20:10,116 --> 00:20:12,369
so he's asleep.

396
00:20:12,452 --> 00:20:14,662
How unfortunate.

397
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:15,955
[RHYA]
Well, anyway,

398
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:19,626
it's good to see the gang's
all here, finally.

399
00:20:19,709 --> 00:20:21,378
The others are out back.

400
00:20:21,461 --> 00:20:22,962
[PATRY]
That's true.

401
00:20:23,046 --> 00:20:25,882
And I'm fairly certain the
Golden Dawn has taken care

402
00:20:25,965 --> 00:20:29,135
of eradicating the
humans in our absence.

403
00:20:29,219 --> 00:20:31,638
Judging by that large
hole in the castle,

404
00:20:31,721 --> 00:20:33,890
I'd say Latry
must've overindulged,

405
00:20:33,973 --> 00:20:37,602
and I'm sure that pompous
king is long dead.

406
00:20:39,187 --> 00:20:41,940
[PATRY] Now all that's left is
to fit the final magic stone

407
00:20:42,023 --> 00:20:44,109
into the pedestal
within the castle

408
00:20:44,192 --> 00:20:47,612
and initiate the spell that will
destroy the Clover Kingdom.

409
00:20:47,696 --> 00:20:50,448
The magic stone is
already in our hands.

410
00:20:50,532 --> 00:20:52,283
We'll wash away the
malice brought on

411
00:20:52,367 --> 00:20:53,827
by that forbidden spell,

412
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:57,539
and then our reincarnation
will be truly complete.

413
00:20:59,082 --> 00:21:01,668
After humanity is snuffed out,

414
00:21:01,751 --> 00:21:02,961
we will reclaim this world,

415
00:21:03,044 --> 00:21:06,297
making it a peaceful
place for elves alone.

416
00:21:14,514 --> 00:21:16,141
[YAMI]
I don't know who's in there,

417
00:21:16,224 --> 00:21:20,186
but I'm guessin' it won't
be an easy fight.

418
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:22,147
Wonder what my
dumbass subordinates

419
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:24,566
and the other Magic
Knights are doin'.

420
00:21:24,649 --> 00:21:26,109
At this rate,
I'll have to flatten

421
00:21:26,192 --> 00:21:28,361
every one o' those
elves by myself.
