1
00:00:22,303 --> 00:00:23,888
[NARRATOR]
The Clover Kingdom.

2
00:00:23,972 --> 00:00:26,474
In this place where
magic is everything,

3
00:00:26,558 --> 00:00:29,394
there lives a magicless
boy named Asta.

4
00:00:29,477 --> 00:00:32,272
This brave young hero
devotes blood, sweat, and tears

5
00:00:32,355 --> 00:00:34,357
to becoming the
next Wizard King.

6
00:00:34,441 --> 00:00:37,861
Though Asta's situation
is practically unheard of,

7
00:00:37,944 --> 00:00:39,904
there are others
residing in this kingdom

8
00:00:39,988 --> 00:00:42,490
who possess at least
a tiny amount of mana,

9
00:00:42,574 --> 00:00:44,993
yet can barely
use spells at all.

10
00:00:45,076 --> 00:00:47,704
They make up a very
small minority,

11
00:00:47,787 --> 00:00:50,165
living their lives
in the shadows.

12
00:00:53,752 --> 00:00:56,546
[NARRATOR]
But, like everyone else,

13
00:00:56,629 --> 00:00:59,007
they do their best to survive.

14
00:02:33,643 --> 00:02:36,271
[NARRATOR] Let's turn
back time for a moment.

15
00:02:36,354 --> 00:02:42,777
[SIONA grunting]

16
00:02:47,032 --> 00:02:49,743
Poor girl. Damn those
Magic Knights.

17
00:02:53,538 --> 00:02:54,956
What's her condition?

18
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,084
She appears to have
cracked several ribs.

19
00:02:58,168 --> 00:03:00,086
[BOW] Shall I prepare
some pain medication?

20
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:01,921
Yes, she could use some.

21
00:03:05,342 --> 00:03:06,593
[BOW]
Here you are.

22
00:03:06,676 --> 00:03:08,720
Thanks, I appreciate it.

23
00:03:08,803 --> 00:03:10,472
Here. Drink.

24
00:03:20,607 --> 00:03:22,984
[KABWE] The pain should
eventually subside.

25
00:03:23,068 --> 00:03:24,444
Okay.

26
00:03:26,154 --> 00:03:28,490
So what should our
next move be?

27
00:03:35,205 --> 00:03:36,623
Master Kabwe?

28
00:03:36,706 --> 00:03:38,625
What exactly do you plan to do?

29
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:40,335
I'm going to kill the prisoner.

30
00:03:40,418 --> 00:03:41,586
[gasps]

31
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:43,088
[DAZU]
No, not yet!

32
00:03:43,171 --> 00:03:45,590
We have more important things
to worry about right now!

33
00:03:45,674 --> 00:03:47,175
Like that book?

34
00:03:47,258 --> 00:03:50,845
It needs to be dealt with, too,
lest our sacrifices be in vain.

35
00:03:50,929 --> 00:03:53,390
Wait. "Dealt with" how?

36
00:03:53,473 --> 00:03:57,352
[KABWE] They say that the devil
dwells in the five-leaf clover.

37
00:03:57,435 --> 00:03:59,729
Let us be rid of this
accursed book at once.

38
00:03:59,813 --> 00:04:01,231
Master Kabwe, please!

39
00:04:01,314 --> 00:04:03,149
Why are you trying to stop me?

40
00:04:03,233 --> 00:04:05,026
This wretched thing.

41
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:07,821
It couldn't possibly be
of further use to us.

42
00:04:09,072 --> 00:04:11,533
[SECREÉ]
Wait.

43
00:04:11,616 --> 00:04:13,410
I don't really care about
what you do to me,

44
00:04:13,493 --> 00:04:17,163
but Asta needs that
book, so give it back.

45
00:04:17,247 --> 00:04:18,998
[KABWE]
What a selfless request.

46
00:04:19,082 --> 00:04:20,625
But when such words
come from lips

47
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:22,877
tainted by forbidden
magic, well...

48
00:04:22,961 --> 00:04:24,879
I'd be a fool to listen.

49
00:04:26,923 --> 00:04:29,259
[SIONA screams]

50
00:04:29,342 --> 00:04:31,386
Siona. What's going on?

51
00:04:35,724 --> 00:04:38,977
[KABWE]
Siona! Is she dead?

52
00:04:40,562 --> 00:04:41,354
[thud]

53
00:04:41,438 --> 00:04:46,359
[gasps] Onoby!

54
00:04:54,868 --> 00:04:56,286
[KABWE]
No.

55
00:04:58,955 --> 00:05:02,417
[KABWE]
Damn you! Why betray us?

56
00:05:06,838 --> 00:05:08,965
Have you still not
put it together?

57
00:05:09,049 --> 00:05:10,508
I'll say it plainly.

58
00:05:10,592 --> 00:05:13,803
The last thing we would want
is to see the devil banished.

59
00:05:16,014 --> 00:05:18,641
We are the Devil Believers.

60
00:05:18,725 --> 00:05:20,894
We're an order that
worships the devil.

61
00:05:20,977 --> 00:05:22,562
That can't be true.

62
00:05:22,645 --> 00:05:25,190
How can anyone worship
such pure evil?

63
00:05:29,486 --> 00:05:32,822
No. You asked us to help
you destroy the devil!

64
00:05:32,906 --> 00:05:36,743
If not that, then what
did you need us for?

65
00:05:36,826 --> 00:05:39,788
[DAZU] You speak like we came
to you as supplicants in need,

66
00:05:39,871 --> 00:05:43,291
but we simply took advantage
of your hatred for the devil.

67
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:44,918
In what way?

68
00:05:45,001 --> 00:05:47,837
Well, seeing as you have access
to the Magic Parliament,

69
00:05:47,921 --> 00:05:51,257
you've been privy to knowledge
that was kept from us peasants.

70
00:05:51,341 --> 00:05:53,176
In addition to that,
it's helpful to have someone

71
00:05:53,259 --> 00:05:54,886
who can actually use magic,

72
00:05:54,969 --> 00:05:57,180
since we're dealing
with the Magic Knights.

73
00:05:57,263 --> 00:05:59,599
[KABWE]
Someone who can use magic?

74
00:05:59,683 --> 00:06:02,227
What are you talking about?

75
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,771
[DAZU]
Right. For somebody like you,

76
00:06:04,854 --> 00:06:09,317
it must be difficult to fathom
that there are people like us

77
00:06:09,401 --> 00:06:11,778
who are all but spurned by mana.

78
00:06:13,488 --> 00:06:16,449
[DAZU] One hot summer day,
the neighborhood kids

79
00:06:16,533 --> 00:06:18,868
asked me to do a favor for them.

80
00:06:26,501 --> 00:06:29,546
[DAZU] They asked me to use
my catalyst magic to mix

81
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:34,300
both of their magics together
so we could all cool off.

82
00:06:41,808 --> 00:06:44,269
[laughs]

83
00:06:44,352 --> 00:06:46,730
[DAZU]
They seemed truly happy.

84
00:06:46,813 --> 00:06:49,858
And seeing their faces
made me feel happy, too.

85
00:07:00,076 --> 00:07:03,538
[DAZU] But then I overheard them
talking behind my back.

86
00:07:03,621 --> 00:07:06,207
They said they were only acting
like my friends to impress

87
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:09,878
the adults, since I didn't
have any real friends.

88
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:14,049
[DAZU] They said it was because
I could barely use magic.

89
00:07:14,132 --> 00:07:15,925
She's so creepy.

90
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:17,010
[CHILD 146A giggles]

91
00:07:17,093 --> 00:07:18,970
[DAZU]
Then they just laughed.

92
00:07:20,138 --> 00:07:22,599
People like us have
no place in this kingdom.

93
00:07:22,682 --> 00:07:25,060
We've been told that
since we were children.

94
00:07:25,143 --> 00:07:29,147
[grunts] You think
this will help you?

95
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:33,026
We do. Before now, it's been
like we didn't even exist.

96
00:07:33,109 --> 00:07:34,402
But no more.

97
00:07:34,486 --> 00:07:36,654
Despite the fact that he
doesn't have a single drop

98
00:07:36,738 --> 00:07:39,324
of magic in his blood,

99
00:07:39,407 --> 00:07:42,494
Asta wields power equal
to that of any great mage

100
00:07:42,577 --> 00:07:45,538
by means of a grimoire
that hosts a devil.

101
00:07:46,581 --> 00:07:47,707
So we'll imitate him.

102
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:49,376
We'll do whatever
we must to obtain

103
00:07:49,459 --> 00:07:52,504
the devil's might for ourselves.

104
00:07:52,587 --> 00:07:54,506
I will not allow that to happen!

105
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:59,844
Why, you...

106
00:08:13,733 --> 00:08:15,110
[BOW]
Let's go.

107
00:08:15,193 --> 00:08:16,319
Right.

108
00:08:28,456 --> 00:08:32,502
[KABWE] No. I can't
let it end like this.

109
00:08:32,585 --> 00:08:34,295
I'll find a way.

110
00:08:37,215 --> 00:08:40,301
We're listening.
Where are you?

111
00:08:40,385 --> 00:08:46,391
[KABWE groaning]
It's a lie.

112
00:08:46,474 --> 00:08:49,310
These people aren't trying to
bring about the devil's demise.

113
00:08:49,394 --> 00:08:51,896
Not at all.

114
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,524
The truth is that...

115
00:08:54,607 --> 00:08:56,651
...they're after
the devil's power!

116
00:08:56,735 --> 00:08:57,861
[ALL gasp]

117
00:08:57,944 --> 00:09:00,530
What do you mean?

118
00:09:00,613 --> 00:09:05,285
[KABWE] This organization
actually worships the devil.

119
00:09:05,368 --> 00:09:08,580
They're called Devil Believers!

120
00:09:09,622 --> 00:09:12,917
[KABWE]
Chairman Damnatio. I'm sorry.

121
00:09:13,001 --> 00:09:16,880
I was a fool.
You must stop them.

122
00:09:16,963 --> 00:09:20,133
Please, sir. For all of us.

123
00:09:22,427 --> 00:09:24,220
What's wrong, Kabwe? Report!

124
00:09:27,682 --> 00:09:30,352
Do you mind filling
us in on the details?

125
00:09:34,147 --> 00:09:36,066
[JULIUS]
A devil-worshipping cult, huh?

126
00:09:36,149 --> 00:09:38,234
Called the Devil Believers.

127
00:09:38,318 --> 00:09:40,028
I don't think your
subordinates would help

128
00:09:40,111 --> 00:09:41,488
that kind of group knowingly.

129
00:09:41,571 --> 00:09:42,781
[DAMNATIO]
It's safe to assume

130
00:09:42,864 --> 00:09:45,742
that they were being used
under false pretenses.

131
00:09:45,825 --> 00:09:48,203
Those gullible idiots.

132
00:09:48,286 --> 00:09:50,455
[YAMI] I get wantin'
to destroy a devil.

133
00:09:50,538 --> 00:09:52,957
But who the hell would
decide to worship one?

134
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:55,502
These people are a bunch
of sickos if you ask me.

135

[knocking]

136
00:09:58,713 --> 00:10:00,382
Excuse me.

137
00:10:00,465 --> 00:10:02,967
We traced the Communication
Magic back to its source,

138
00:10:03,051 --> 00:10:05,011
and it would appear
to have come from Tiulyu.

139
00:10:05,095 --> 00:10:07,806
Well, that's a surprise.

140
00:10:07,889 --> 00:10:10,392
Julius?

141
00:10:10,475 --> 00:10:12,936
I order the Black Bulls
to travel to Tiulyu,

142
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:14,938
apprehend these
"Devil Believers,"

143
00:10:15,021 --> 00:10:17,941
and save Nero
from their clutches.

144
00:10:18,024 --> 00:10:19,442
You got it.

145
00:10:28,618 --> 00:10:30,662
[YAMI] He must've used
the last of his strength

146
00:10:30,745 --> 00:10:34,082
to grab that thing so he could
contact his former boss.

147
00:10:34,165 --> 00:10:35,709
Was it an argument gone bad?

148
00:10:35,792 --> 00:10:37,711
Nah, there'd be
signs of a struggle.

149
00:10:37,794 --> 00:10:40,213
These guys didn't have
a chance to fight back.

150
00:10:40,296 --> 00:10:42,465
So they just slaughtered
their own people?

151
00:10:42,549 --> 00:10:44,384
S'like Chairman Chin-mole said,

152
00:10:44,467 --> 00:10:46,469
they were bein'
played for fools.

153
00:10:46,553 --> 00:10:48,430
They thought they
were fighting a devil.

154
00:10:48,513 --> 00:10:52,017
Guess they must've
outlived their usefulness.

155
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,102
[GORDON]
Captain.

156
00:10:54,185 --> 00:10:55,979
So creepy.

[GORDON]
A venomless viper.

158

Powdered long-necked
softshell turtle,

159
00:11:00,817 --> 00:11:03,403
and the root of
a gorikabuto plant.

160
00:11:03,486 --> 00:11:06,281
These ingredients are all
quite difficult to come by.

161
00:11:06,364 --> 00:11:08,533
And knowing that...

162
00:11:08,616 --> 00:11:10,827
[GORDON] We can assume that the
potion which put my best friend

163
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:13,455
Asta to sleep was
likely made here,

164
00:11:13,538 --> 00:11:16,916
as were the potions used
at the execution site.

165
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,294
I would love to get more
information on the person

166
00:11:19,377 --> 00:11:22,088
who lives here,
but the local villagers

167
00:11:22,172 --> 00:11:26,092
seem to be pretty wary of us.

168
00:11:26,176 --> 00:11:28,595
I can help you with that, sir.

169
00:11:31,139 --> 00:11:33,600
[GORDON]
Granny Maggie? It's me.

170
00:11:34,642 --> 00:11:37,562
Oh, hi, Gordon!
You brought some friends, eh?

171
00:11:37,645 --> 00:11:39,064
This is Granny Maggie, everyone.

172
00:11:39,147 --> 00:11:40,857
We got to know each other
and became friends

173
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,692
the last time we were here.

174
00:11:42,776 --> 00:11:44,069
How goes it, Granny?

175
00:11:44,152 --> 00:11:46,946
My name is Asta, ma'am!
It's an honor to meet you!

176
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,073
[MAGNA]
You're way too loud!

177
00:11:48,156 --> 00:11:49,574
So are you, Magna.

178
00:11:49,657 --> 00:11:50,992
Hold on.

179
00:11:51,076 --> 00:11:53,745
Where is that mean-looking boy
who called me an angel?

180
00:11:53,828 --> 00:11:57,248
Don't tell me you came all
this way and didn't bring him.

181
00:11:57,332 --> 00:11:58,792
An angel?

182
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:01,211
[GORDON] Oh, if you mean
my best friend Gauche,

183
00:12:01,294 --> 00:12:05,006
he's back at the capital
watching over his little sister.

184
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,383
Ah, well it's a relief to hear

185
00:12:06,466 --> 00:12:08,843
he was able to
find the poor girl.

186
00:12:08,927 --> 00:12:10,178
[GORDON]
Right?

187
00:12:10,261 --> 00:12:11,971
[YAMI] I hate to rush
this cute little reunion,

188
00:12:12,055 --> 00:12:14,891
but can we pick your
brain for a bit, granny?

189
00:12:14,974 --> 00:12:17,143
We need info on the person
who lives in the forest

190
00:12:17,227 --> 00:12:19,270
on the outskirts of town.

191
00:12:19,354 --> 00:12:21,022
You talking about Bow?

192
00:12:21,106 --> 00:12:22,440
[YAMI]
Yeah, prob'ly.

193
00:12:22,524 --> 00:12:24,275
We need you to tell us
everything you know about Bow;

194
00:12:24,359 --> 00:12:25,402
it's real important.

195
00:12:25,485 --> 00:12:27,529
I can do that.

196
00:12:27,612 --> 00:12:29,072
But next time you come around,

197
00:12:29,155 --> 00:12:31,700
you bring that broody young
Gauche fellow with you.

198
00:12:31,783 --> 00:12:33,576
[YAMI]
Oh, you got it.

199
00:12:34,911 --> 00:12:37,497
[NOELLE]
She can barely use magic?

200
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,374
It's not actually all that rare.

201
00:12:39,457 --> 00:12:42,002
Though I bet it seemed
that way to you, Noelle.

202
00:12:42,085 --> 00:12:43,795
You can't really blame her.

203
00:12:43,878 --> 00:12:46,965
I mean every single member
of her family's good at magic.

204
00:12:47,048 --> 00:12:50,468
And Asta can't use it at all,
and she knows he's a freak.

205
00:12:50,552 --> 00:12:51,720
This is all your fault.

206
00:12:51,803 --> 00:12:53,054
My fault?!

207
00:12:53,138 --> 00:12:54,973
[MAGGIE]
But...

208
00:12:55,056 --> 00:12:58,226
Bow is also a wonderfully
skilled apothecary.

209
00:12:58,309 --> 00:13:00,437
We don't go to a mage
with recovery magic

210
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,272
when we fall ill in this town.

211
00:13:02,355 --> 00:13:04,733
Here in Tiulyu, the sickly
go straight to Bow,

212
00:13:04,816 --> 00:13:06,901
with her expertly made medicine.

213
00:13:06,985 --> 00:13:09,946
I could tell she was skilled
just by looking at her shelves.

214
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,699
I hear she worked hard
to become that good.

215
00:13:12,782 --> 00:13:15,702
Perhaps we're all lucky
she couldn't use magic,

216
00:13:15,785 --> 00:13:18,830
because that's what drove
her to develop such a skill.

217
00:13:18,913 --> 00:13:21,207
Kind of sounds like a
certain meathead I know.

218
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:22,292
Uh--

219
00:13:23,293 --> 00:13:24,586
Come to think of it,

220
00:13:24,669 --> 00:13:27,547
you might want to hear about
Bow's good friend, Dazu.

221
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:30,133
She lost both her husband
and her mother-in-law

222
00:13:30,216 --> 00:13:33,094
when those devil servants
attacked the town.

223
00:13:33,178 --> 00:13:34,846
Where can we find her?

224
00:13:37,766 --> 00:13:40,810
[MAGGIE] Like Bow,
Dazu can't really use magic.

225
00:13:40,894 --> 00:13:43,188
But she never let
that get her down.

226
00:13:43,271 --> 00:13:46,191
She's a wonderful girl
who's been through a lot.

227
00:13:46,274 --> 00:13:48,902
You had better be nice
to her if you meet.

228
00:13:48,985 --> 00:13:51,821
She got along very well
with her husband, Vide.

229
00:13:51,905 --> 00:13:55,700
The two of them were as happy
as any couple I've seen.

230
00:13:55,784 --> 00:13:58,286
Her husband's mother,
Meshu, would always talk

231
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:02,248
about what a wonderful
daughter-in-law she was.

232
00:14:02,332 --> 00:14:04,292
[FINRAL]
Yami!

233
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:06,753
I think you should take
a look at this, sir.

234
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,591
[YAMI]
This woman.

235
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:20,058
Oh, yeah, I've seen her before.

236
00:14:20,141 --> 00:14:22,268
Something's not
right about this.

237
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,854
Well, think about it.

238
00:14:24,938 --> 00:14:26,940
The old lady was just going
on and on about how Dazu

239
00:14:27,023 --> 00:14:29,776
and her husband
were deeply happy,

240
00:14:29,859 --> 00:14:32,362
but that face looks
pretty dead inside.

241
00:14:34,072 --> 00:14:35,907
Hang on.

242
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:39,369
Why would someone whose
family was killed by a devil

243
00:14:39,452 --> 00:14:42,789
become one of the creeps
who worships a devil?

244
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:45,500
[JULIUS]
Nice work.

245
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:47,002
You're on the right path--

246
00:14:47,085 --> 00:14:49,796
just keep flipping over rocks
until you find some worms.

247
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:53,466
[YAMI] Yeah, about that.
Honestly, I have my doubts.

248
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,759
And why is that?

249
00:14:54,843 --> 00:14:56,928
The trail's gettin'
kinda cold is all.

250
00:14:57,012 --> 00:15:01,307
I don't suppose you have any
other intel we can go off of.

251
00:15:01,391 --> 00:15:02,767
[JULIUS]
Nothing solid.

252
00:15:02,851 --> 00:15:05,186
I will say that the Devil
Believers sought out people

253
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:07,188
with the Magic Parliament
in the hopes of getting

254
00:15:07,272 --> 00:15:09,399
sensitive information from them.

255
00:15:09,482 --> 00:15:12,068
With that in mind, they
likely know that the devil

256
00:15:12,152 --> 00:15:13,945
Megicula is in
the Spade Kingdom,

257
00:15:14,029 --> 00:15:16,865
and that information probably
factors into their plans.

258
00:15:16,948 --> 00:15:20,702
So what, you think they might
wanna offer Nero as a gift? Huh.

259
00:15:20,785 --> 00:15:23,747
That reminds me, they still
have the kid's grimoire, too.

260
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:26,082
How could you forget
something that important?

261
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:28,710
Right. They probably wanted
to give you and the grimoire

262
00:15:28,793 --> 00:15:32,088
to Megicula as some
kinda package deal.

263
00:15:32,172 --> 00:15:33,381
[JULIUS]
Once they pay tribute,

264
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:35,091
they'll defect to
the Spade Kingdom.

265
00:15:35,175 --> 00:15:37,510
Or rather, the devil inside it.

266
00:15:37,594 --> 00:15:39,554
Okay, buy why?

267
00:15:39,637 --> 00:15:41,139
[JULIUS] I doubt we can
answer that question

268
00:15:41,222 --> 00:15:44,434
without asking these
people in person.

269
00:15:44,517 --> 00:15:47,354
But in any case, we can
expect these cultists

270
00:15:47,437 --> 00:15:50,065
to start moving north.
To reach the border,

271
00:15:50,148 --> 00:15:52,567
they'll have to cut across
the Forsaken Realm.

272
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:54,361
Right. Good luck.

273
00:15:54,444 --> 00:15:55,653
[YAMI]
Thanks.

274
00:15:57,822 --> 00:16:00,408
Look sharp, dumbasses!
We're movin' out.

275
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:01,826
[BLACK BULLS]
Yes, sir!

276
00:16:03,453 --> 00:16:04,454
[GAUCHE]
A mission?

277
00:16:04,537 --> 00:16:05,830
That's right.

278
00:16:05,914 --> 00:16:07,624
I can't.

279
00:16:07,707 --> 00:16:09,167
[SISTER THERESA]
Neglecting your duties?

280
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,961
You must enjoy
disappointing your sister.

281
00:16:12,045 --> 00:16:13,254
[GAUCHE]
Old hag?

282
00:16:13,338 --> 00:16:15,590
Just what do you think
you're doing here?

283
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:16,800
[SISTER THERESA]
I think you know.

284
00:16:16,883 --> 00:16:18,885
I'm here to rescue Marie
from her obsessive,

285
00:16:18,968 --> 00:16:20,345
good-for-nothing brother.

286
00:16:20,428 --> 00:16:22,889
No. My angel stays here.

287
00:16:22,972 --> 00:16:24,808
What happened to her
before was a fluke.

288
00:16:24,891 --> 00:16:27,227
I can guarantee
Marie's safety now.

289
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:29,813
Now get over yourself
and go do your job.

290
00:16:29,896 --> 00:16:31,398
Shut your mouth, old hag!

291
00:16:31,481 --> 00:16:32,732
There's no job
that's more important

292
00:16:32,816 --> 00:16:34,567
than watching over Marie!

293
00:16:34,651 --> 00:16:35,985
[SISTER THERESA]
And have you given any thought

294
00:16:36,069 --> 00:16:38,071
to what would make Marie happy?

295
00:16:39,781 --> 00:16:40,699
[MARIE]
Magic Knights are supposed

296
00:16:40,782 --> 00:16:42,659
to keep people safe, right?

297
00:16:42,742 --> 00:16:44,536
I was proud when I
found out my big brother

298
00:16:44,619 --> 00:16:46,371
was going to be a Magic Knight,

299
00:16:46,454 --> 00:16:50,333
and I wanna keep being proud
of you. So please, Gauche!

300
00:16:50,417 --> 00:16:53,336
[GAUCHE] Tch. I'll listen
to you this time,

301
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,005
but don't get used to it.

302
00:16:55,088 --> 00:16:56,881
I'm trusting you,
so you had better not

303
00:16:56,965 --> 00:16:59,009
put Marie in danger again.

304
00:17:01,594 --> 00:17:03,471
Get your ass over here.

305
00:17:05,265 --> 00:17:07,183
She'll be safe with me.

306
00:17:17,152 --> 00:17:19,612
[NARRATOR] And so, the Black
Bulls began their pursuit

307
00:17:19,696 --> 00:17:22,115
of the Devil Believers,
who were thought to have fled

308
00:17:22,198 --> 00:17:24,284
into the Forsaken Realm.

309
00:17:24,367 --> 00:17:26,661
In case this thinking
had been in error,

310
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:28,455
the other Magic Knight
squads were sent out

311
00:17:28,538 --> 00:17:31,207
to search the Common
Realm, far and wide.

312
00:17:34,336 --> 00:17:36,838
[NARRATOR] But no matter how
diligently the Magic Knights

313
00:17:36,921 --> 00:17:40,550
searched, they had no luck
finding the Devil Believers,

314
00:17:40,633 --> 00:17:43,636
and several days passed
with no progress.

315
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:48,641
[YAMI] We've trekked through
half the Forsaken Realm

316
00:17:48,725 --> 00:17:51,311
chasin' these jerks,
but we haven't caught

317
00:17:51,394 --> 00:17:54,022
so much as a whiff
of their mana yet.

318
00:17:54,105 --> 00:17:55,357
It's possible that they're using

319
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,568
some kind of devices to
keep their mana concealed.

320
00:17:58,651 --> 00:18:02,238
The other squads haven't found
anything noteworthy either.

321
00:18:02,322 --> 00:18:03,448
At this point,

322
00:18:03,531 --> 00:18:05,617
I would assume they've
past the Forsaken Realm

323
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,119
and are bound for the
Spade Kingdom's border.

324
00:18:08,203 --> 00:18:09,871
Sounds about right.

325
00:18:09,954 --> 00:18:11,331
We've come across a few signs

326
00:18:11,414 --> 00:18:13,208
that they passed
through ahead of us.

327
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:14,501
[JULIUS]
Signs?

328
00:18:14,584 --> 00:18:17,962
[YAMI]
Yeah. Bunch'a weird crap.

329
00:18:18,046 --> 00:18:21,049
[panting]

330
00:18:21,132 --> 00:18:22,258
The locals at this village

331
00:18:22,342 --> 00:18:24,386
say a bunch of their
people disappeared, too.

332
00:18:24,469 --> 00:18:26,763
It's happening everywhere we go.

333
00:18:26,846 --> 00:18:29,265
Do you think these Devil
Whatevers are behind it?

334
00:18:29,349 --> 00:18:32,352
That'll be my guess
until I hear a better one.

335
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:36,106
[MAGNA] Hey! I got a
question for you guys.

336
00:18:38,692 --> 00:18:41,861
Why the hell is everybody
so determined to avoid us?

337
00:18:41,945 --> 00:18:42,862
It's due to what happened

338
00:18:42,946 --> 00:18:45,657
with the Eye of
the Midnight Sun.

339
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:48,201
The people of the Forsaken Realm
have had it quite rough.

340
00:18:48,284 --> 00:18:50,286
Almost everyone here feels
like the Magic Knights

341
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:51,788
left them high and dry.

342
00:18:51,871 --> 00:18:53,498
And at least a few
of these people believe

343
00:18:53,581 --> 00:18:56,292
that the Magic Knights
were behind the attacks.

344
00:18:57,877 --> 00:19:01,631
[BOY 146A] I'll do what I want!
You can't make me stay!

345
00:19:01,715 --> 00:19:03,341
[MOM 146A]
Please, don't do this!

346
00:19:03,425 --> 00:19:04,551
[BOY 146A]
Stop trying to keep me here.

347
00:19:04,634 --> 00:19:07,470
You've already made me
late to the meet-up!

348
00:19:07,554 --> 00:19:10,473
Everyone else is already there.
I have to leave right now!

349
00:19:10,557 --> 00:19:13,143
You think they'll heal your leg
with the devil's power?

350
00:19:13,226 --> 00:19:15,395
Do you know how
ridiculous that sounds?

351
00:19:15,478 --> 00:19:16,896
Why would you think
that's possible?

352
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,107
[BOY 146A] I don't "think"
it is, I <i>know</i> it is!

353
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:21,985
I mean, there's a guy who
doesn't have any magic at all,

354
00:19:22,068 --> 00:19:23,236
and with the devil's powers,

355
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:26,114
he was able to get into
the Magic Knights!

356
00:19:26,197 --> 00:19:29,117
[MOM 146A] But the boy was put
on trial for using those powers.

357
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,452
[BOY 146A]
What do I care?

358
00:19:30,535 --> 00:19:31,911
Once I have the devil's powers,

359
00:19:31,995 --> 00:19:34,497
I won't have to be scared
of trials or anything else!

360
00:19:34,581 --> 00:19:35,832
Now let me go!

361
00:19:35,915 --> 00:19:39,085
[MOM 146A] No, don't!
Someone stop him! Please!

362
00:19:41,212 --> 00:19:41,963
[DAD 146A]
What the--?

363
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:43,715
Hold it right there! Hey!

364
00:19:43,798 --> 00:19:46,676
You had better explain why your
mother's on the ground. Now.

365
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,886
Just let go of me.

366
00:19:47,969 --> 00:19:50,430
I have to leave right now,
no matter what!

367
00:19:50,513 --> 00:19:53,350
They're all waiting for me
just outside of town!

368
00:19:57,604 --> 00:19:58,772
[MAGNA]
Yup. We're makin' our way

369
00:19:58,855 --> 00:20:02,233
from Hecairo straight
up to the border.

370
00:20:02,317 --> 00:20:03,568
[YAMI]
There are two big rivers

371
00:20:03,651 --> 00:20:06,529
that flow into each other
there, is that right?

372
00:20:06,613 --> 00:20:07,530
Yeah.

373
00:20:07,614 --> 00:20:09,657
I don't see any people though.

374
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:12,327
[MAGNA]
Well...

375
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:15,288
This is proof that we're still
on their trail, at least.

376
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:20,877
Hey, you're not lettin'
what that kid said

377
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,337
bug you, right?

378
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:25,340
Oh, come on, Magna.
Do I look like I'm upset?

379
00:20:25,423 --> 00:20:27,467
Yeah, you do.

380
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:29,594
Uh, how do I put this?

381
00:20:29,678 --> 00:20:31,513
That poor kid's really
struggling with his leg,

382
00:20:31,596 --> 00:20:34,766
so it makes sense that he would
do anything to try and heal it.

383
00:20:34,849 --> 00:20:36,476
Right?

384
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,062
And these Devil Believers
are preying on that.

385
00:20:39,145 --> 00:20:41,189
They're at least pretending
to be a ray of hope

386
00:20:41,272 --> 00:20:43,108
for people like him.

387
00:20:43,191 --> 00:20:44,984
These people have
nowhere left to turn.

388
00:20:45,068 --> 00:20:46,695
They've run out of options,

389
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:49,322
so they'll take a deal
too good to be true.

390
00:20:49,406 --> 00:20:51,116
Yeah, well, anyway.

391
00:20:51,199 --> 00:20:54,077
We've gotta do something
about them, fast.

392
00:20:57,539 --> 00:20:59,374
[YAMI] The area past Breed
Mountain heading toward

393
00:20:59,457 --> 00:21:02,043
the Spade Kingdom has
some volatile mana.

394
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:04,754
The weather tends
to get real rough.

395
00:21:04,838 --> 00:21:08,466
Odds are they'll probably
have to stop and wait it out.

396
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:10,552
[MAGNA]
Roger that.

397
00:21:10,635 --> 00:21:12,470
[YAMI]
There's backup on the way.

398
00:21:12,554 --> 00:21:15,306
But I want you three to race
ahead and scout 'em out.

399
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:17,058
We can't let 'em
cross the border.

400
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:18,143
Understood?

401
00:21:18,226 --> 00:21:20,311
[GROUP]
Sir!

402
00:21:20,395 --> 00:21:22,063
[ASTA]
Nero...

403
00:21:29,696 --> 00:21:31,322
Ah, crap!

404
00:21:31,406 --> 00:21:32,866
[ASTA]
Whoa!

405
00:21:32,949 --> 00:21:36,202
Come on, Magna, can't you
fly this thing any steadier?

406
00:21:36,286 --> 00:21:37,996
You're kiddin' me, right?

407
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:42,083
[MAGNA] It's gonna be pretty
difficult to catch them

408
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:45,462
if they managed to make it past
Breed Mountain in this weather.

409
00:21:45,545 --> 00:21:48,715
[gasps] Look down there.
I think I see them!

410
00:21:55,305 --> 00:21:58,141
How are there so many?
This is insane.

411
00:23:57,802 --> 00:23:59,512
[ASTA]
We finally caught up with them!

412
00:23:59,596 --> 00:24:01,806
And they really are heading
to the Spade Kingdom!

413
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:06,102
<i>Black Clover</i> , Page 147:
"Prepared to Die."

414
00:24:06,186 --> 00:24:08,229
We can't wait
for reinforcements!

415
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:10,565
Don't worry, Nero.
We'll save you!
