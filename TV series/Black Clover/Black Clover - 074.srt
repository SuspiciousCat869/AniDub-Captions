1
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:15,708
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:18,583
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:24,458
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:27,000
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:35,583
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:39,708
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:45,375
[JULIUS] I'm glad you were
all able to attend.

8
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:47,333
Without further ado,
I'd like to commence

9
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:50,208
with the Royal Knights
Selection Test.

10
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:52,041
[NARRATOR]
The exam to decide which Knights

11
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:53,875
would fight the Eye
of the Midnight Sun

12
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:56,166
had just gotten underway...

13
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,208
...when suddenly,
a mysterious man

14
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:00,208
appeared on the scene.

15
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:03,708
[ZORA] So sorry I'm late
for the party, everybody.

16
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:08,333
Who, me? I'm Xerx Lugner.
Pleasure's mine.

17
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:10,208
[NARRATOR] Despite Asta's
immediate distrust

18
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:12,208
of this "Xerx," the two of them

19
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:13,541
soon discovered
that they had been

20
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:16,041
placed on the same team
for the tournament.

21
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:21,208
[NARRATOR] And, so, in this
tense and menacing atmosphere,

22
00:01:21,291 --> 00:01:24,500
the Royal Knights Selection
Test begins in earnest.

23
00:01:24,583 --> 00:01:28,041
Magic Knights, it's time
to start the exam!

24
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:33,541
Now that the
explanations are done,

25
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:35,833
I hope our first
two teams are ready.

26
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:38,541
[yells]

27
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:40,791
I was born ready, Your Majesty!

28
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:20,500
[MAGNA]
Asta!

29
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,583
Give those guys a beatin'
they won't forget!

30
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:23,666
That's right, show them

31
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,458
what the Black Bulls
are all about!

32
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,125
Give it your best, okay?

33
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:29,875
Hurry up and take care of them
so you can spar with me later!

34
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:31,166
Don't be reckless!

35
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,916
[mumbling] I swear I won't
take my eyes off you

36
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,250
the entire battle.
I won't even blink.

37
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,625
Ah. What kind of
interesting spells

38
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:40,708
will I get to see today?
I can't wait to find out!

39
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:42,375
[CHARMY]
Here. Anything's more exciting

40
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:44,166
to watch with a snack.

41
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,541
Why thank you!

42
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,958
[ASTA yells]
I'm totally psyched now!

43
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:53,250
It's time to do this thing!

44
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:56,375
Quit shouting already.
This is an exam.

45
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:58,208
You need to stay calm and focus.

46
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:01,000
Look. The best tactic
is to study the terrain

47
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:03,041
and figure out what
each of us can offer.

48
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:04,625
[ASTA growls]

49
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:07,166
You're right! I hate it,
but you're so right!

50
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,208
[ZORA] Everything I say
is right, short stack,

51
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,500
so get used to it.

52
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,791
Settle down now, both of you.

53
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:16,625
[MIMOSA] Aw, Asta's cute even
when he's gritting his teeth!

54
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:18,291
I agree with Xerx, though.

55
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:20,250
Let's get familiar with
each other's abilities

56
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,250
and come up with a solid plan.

57
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:24,875
I'm sure that's what the other
team is doing right now.

58
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:26,875
Yeah! That's good thinking!

59
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:30,291
My Plant Magic is best suited
for support and recovery.

60
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:32,875
And Asta's anti-magic will
be useful at close range

61
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:36,250
to nullify the spells
our opponents cast.

62
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:38,666
What kind of magic
do you have, Xerx?

63
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:41,416
[ALL gasp]

64
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,208
What the--?

65
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:44,791
[MIMOSA]
They're already attacking?

66
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:48,458
So fast! And which direction
did it come from?

67
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:52,083
Either way, I've gotta
keep our crystal safe!

68
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,791
Oh, no!

69
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:56,041
That looked like a
long-distance strike.

70
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:57,583
But how was it so accurate?

71
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:59,583
I don't understand this!

72
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,625
Where's it coming from?

73
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,416
Looks like ten o'clock,
three meters.

74
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,708
Do you copy?

75
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,000
[FORTI]
Roger.

76
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:08,000
Thanks to a highly precise
Crystal Magic spell

77
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:09,916
called Crystal Scope,
their whereabouts

78
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,166
are as clear as well,
he, heh, you know.

79
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,083
I'll make you pay for ridiculing
the Wizard King, knave!

80
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:19,125
You don't deserve a chance
to shine after that stunt!

81
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:23,791
Flame Magic: Burst Javelin!

82
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:26,708
Combined with
Rock Magic: Strong Bow!

83
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,791
We're gonna lose!

84
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,291
Crap. What now?

85
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:37,833
If we work together we--

86
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:43,958
Seriously, what is the
matter with this guy?!

87
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:44,958
He's terrible!

88
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:46,000
He's... asleep?

89
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:47,208
Yup, he's out cold.

90
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:48,083
Sure looks like it.

91
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:49,583
Guess he needs a nap.

92
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:50,458
[mumbling] That's pathetic.

93
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:51,666
How could anybody fall asleep

94
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,000
with all of these
people watching them?

95
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:56,541
The shame! The embarrassment!

96
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,208
My, I never expected
a tournament like this

97
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,125
to devolve into naptime!

98
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:06,708
They must be worn out.
Unless... it's a trick.

99
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:09,375
What the heck are you layin'
on the ground for, huh?

100
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:11,166
If you don't get off
your lazy butt right now,

101
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,916
our team's crystal is gonna
be smashed to pieces!

102
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,833
Do you wanna win
this thing or not?

103
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:17,958
--[yawns]
--You're such a jerk!

104
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:21,041
Winning or losing doesn't
make a difference to me.

105
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:23,416
Nor do I care how
badly you wanna win.

106
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:27,083
So just direct all that
unchecked enthusiasm elsewhere.

107
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:29,916
Listen, I kinda pulled
an all-nighter last night.

108
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,583
I'd appreciate it if you two
would let me catch a few Zs.

109
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:36,666
[RICK] That Xerx fellow actually
has the nerve to sleep!

110
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,916
[FORTI] Do you think it's
some kind of strategy?

111
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,208
It's not.

112
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:42,250
My Crystal Scope can
identify not just location

113
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:44,583
but the physical state
of its targets.

114
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:48,250
There's no doubt--that
ruffian is fast asleep!

115
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:49,958
[FORTI]
How can one man be so arrogant,

116
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:52,125
especially after the way he
insulted the Wizard King

117
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:53,291
when he first arrived?

118
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,625
That's enough! He's dead!

119
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:57,000
Whatever his little plan may be,

120
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,291
if you don't move,
you can't win.

121
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:02,625
Let's put a stop to
this here and now!

122
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:06,958
Plant Creation Magic:
Magic Flower Guidepost!

123
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,416
[MIMOSA] Looks like two of them
are close to the crystal,

124
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,041
and the other one is 60 meters
in front up in a tree!

125
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:16,875
[MIMOSA gasps]
The pair's magic is inflated!

126
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:20,166
They must be casting
a combo spell!

127
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,625
From that far away?
Prepare for another attack!

128
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:24,791
Right!

129
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:26,791
[ASTA] The last couple
were pretty fast.

130
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:29,750
But if I can nail down
the direction and timing...

131
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,666
[ASTA]
Gotcha!

132
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:37,000
[ASTA]
Aw, yeah!

133
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:38,416
[MIMOSA]
That blast was so quick,

134
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,500
I never could've
dodged it in time.

135
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:44,166
Asta really is amazing!

136
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,541
We don't stand
a chance of winning

137
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:46,958
without Xerx's help, though.

138
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:48,458
It's two against three!

139
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:50,125
Come on, our best
course of action

140
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:54,250
is to leave this guy behind
and do what we can on our own!

141
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:55,916
I can pinpoint the
enemies' positions

142
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,416
and distract them. You focus
on protecting the crystal.

143
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,000
The two of us are
going to charge toward

144
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:03,583
their crystal and hopefully
we can destroy it directly.

145
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:05,625
It's the only option now!

146
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:08,125
[ASTA]
Mimosa's good at thinkin' fast.

147
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:09,875
She's been through some
really tough battles,

148
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:11,458
that's for sure.

149
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:13,958
All right! That's what we'll do!

150
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:16,416
Our first team effort
is goin' great, huh?

151
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,416
It is our first! I'm glad!

152
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,166
Let's go!

153
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,000
Here it comes!

154
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:24,708
[ASTA yells]

155
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:26,083
[MAGIC KNIGHT 74A]
Look at that!

156
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:28,083
Those two are running
straight toward the target!

157
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:30,125
[MAGIC KNIGHT 74B]
That guy's got some guts!

158
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:32,166
[MAGIC KNIGHT 74C] Too bad
their teammate's takin' a nap.

159
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,875
Is he trying to pull somethin'?

160
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,083
[MAGIC KNIGHT 74D]
Maybe.

161
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:36,500
But whether it works
or not's gonna depend

162
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,541
on their abilities.

163
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:40,708
Do you actually find
this interesting?

164
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:42,583
A date with me would have
been a lot more fun,

165
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:45,625
but somebody couldn't
be bothered to go.

166
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:46,791
What's with that face?

167
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,916
Ugh, doesn't anything
get to you?

168
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,083
That's it, Mr. Grumpy.
I'm gonna force you to smile!

169
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:59,458
[NOELLE] You know, those two
actually make a good team.

170
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:02,458
I mean, not that it
matters to me whatsoever!

171
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:05,625
You can do this.
Both of you, be strong!

172
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:07,833
[RICK]
What's that boy thinking?

173
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:10,125
He's blocking all our combo
spells as he rushes in,

174
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:11,916
crystal in tow!

175
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,416
It would appear he's planning
to strike us head-on!

176
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,125
One of them must be tracking
our location, as well.

177
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:19,583
They're coming closer!

178
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:24,666
[ASTA] Up there! They're
guarding the crystal!

179
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,666
That's them!

180
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,083
We have nothing to fear.

181
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,208
After all, our crystal
is completely untouched,

182
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:32,000
and theirs is already
quite damaged.

183
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:33,625
[MIMOSA]
Plant Magic...

184
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:35,958
Huh? Rock Magic...

185
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:38,291
[MIMOSA]
...Magic Cannon Flower!

186
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,541
Rock Fortress!

187
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,708
[ASTA]
Oh, wow, Mimosa!

188
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:49,125
I didn't know you could do
any super-cool attack spells!

189
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:52,250
[MIMOSA] Asta. I'm going
to get stronger.

190
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,000
The next time we face
an enemy together,

191
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:56,250
I'll be able to
fight by your side.

192
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:03,000
I'll take the lead now, Asta.

193
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,791
Let's turn this around!

194
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:15,375
[MIMOSA] We may be down a
teammate, but we can still win!

195
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:18,250
[ASTA] Awesome, I can
really count on this girl!

196
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,333
I know just what to do!

197
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:22,583
Magic Cannon Flower!

198
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:29,750
Man, check her out!

199
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:32,750
So she's not just a pretty face,
but she's powerful, too?

200
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,583
Yeah! It's love!

201
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,583
She's the total package!

202
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:39,500
That's fantastic! She
sure knows her stuff!

203
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,500
I wonder if she'll
let me spar with her!

204
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:44,125
[VANESSA]
Hm. That cute little flower's

205
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,416
really starting to bloom!

206
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,375
It's probably because
she's working with Asta.

207
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:50,208
[GREY] I can't believe she's
able to fight so boldly

208
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,416
in front of such a huge
audience! Isn't she scared?

209
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,833
[mumbling] What a
wonderful teammate.

210
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:55,875
[NOELLE]
Wow, she's good.

211
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:58,291
[KLAUS] During my training,
I noticed your improvement,

212
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,708
but now that you're here,
I can see how much progress

213
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:01,916
you've made on your journey!

214
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,791
As your superior,
I'm very proud of you!

215
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:07,625
[NOELLE]
She's giving this all she's got.

216
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,416
I have to start taking
things more seriously!

217
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,416
I'm not losing to her!

218
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,083
[YUNO]
Nice work, Mimosa.

219
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:17,750
What was that? You smiled
for me, didn't you?

220
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:19,958
Woo-hoo, I finally
got what I wanted!

221
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:23,250
I'm not smiling. You're
just seeing things.

222
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,291
You have to have the
last word, don't you?

223
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:28,333
But, hey. I don't necessarily
dislike that about you.

224
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:29,625
Hmph.

225
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:31,083
Good!

226
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,291
And she's got a fair amount
of room to grow, as well.

227
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:39,041
Go, Asta! You can do it!

228
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:41,750
And if you win, I'll
give you a tasty snack!

229
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:45,833
[CURTIS]
They're missing their third man.

230
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:48,541
Perhaps it's best to approach
and overpower them.

231
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:49,958
Not yet.

232
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:53,625
The weapon that boy is holding
is an anti-magic sword.

233
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:55,375
I saw its power.
There will be no

234
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:57,416
defeating it in
close-quarters combat.

235
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,500
What? Anti-magic?

236
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:04,125
I'd heard rumors, but he's
the one who wields it?

237
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:07,250
It would be foolish to
engage him too casually.

238
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:08,750
Well, then.

239
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:16,250
They split up! But which
one has the crystal?

240
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:18,625
Magic Flower Guidepost!

241
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:22,000
Judging from this...

242
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:23,375
Aim for the left!

243
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:24,750
[ASTA]
You got it!

244
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:30,916
That's it, boy!
You're no match for me!

245
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:35,166
That's a huge
power concentration!

246
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,333
Careful, the next attack
will be enormous!

247
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:38,583
Then I'll have to
slice through that

248
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:40,500
and the crystal, too!

249
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:41,583
[gasps]

250
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:44,333
[MIMOSA]
What? Two identical reactions.

251
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:47,333
The other two are preparing
heavy midrange attacks!

252
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:52,083
[MIMOSA]
Which means we're surrounded!

253
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:54,458
If even one of those
spells hits our crystal,

254
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:56,750
it won't survive the damage!

255
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:59,208
Asta might be able to take
them on one at a time,

256
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:01,916
but we're done for if
they all strike at once!

257
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,291
Asta!

258
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,125
[ASTA gasps]

259
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:09,375
[ASTA screams]

260
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,333
No! They've got him!

261
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:15,250
[ALL]
Asta, no!

262
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:16,583
--[YUNO, KLAUS gasp]
--It's a trap!

263
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:17,541
Is that...?

264
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:21,208
[yelling]

265
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:22,666
[JULIUS]
Hm...

266
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:29,250
[MIMOSA] So one of them can
use paralyzing Trap magic?

267
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:31,291
Where did it come from?

268
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:37,166
[MIMOSA]
We can't be sure of anything!

269
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,458
This test is more
rigorous than I expected!

270
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:44,291
[gasps]

271

Do it now!

274
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:58,250
[MIMOSA]
From three directions?

275
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:01,125
[KLAUS] They can't dodge that,
they're trapped like rats!

276
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:04,291
Oh, dear. This
doesn't look good.

277

[ALL gasp]

278
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:25,333
[CURTIS]
What happened to our magic?

279
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:32,791
Whoa!

280
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:33,833

[ALL gasping]

283
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,500
[CURTIS, RICK, FORTI]
Our spells are being sent

284
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:42,083
straight back at us!

285
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:50,625
[gasps] What kind of
ability was that?

286
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:53,333
I-I'm not sure.

287
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,833
[MIMOSA]
Asta!

288
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:08,333
[ZORA laughs]

289
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:13,958
[yawns] Well, looks like
everything worked out okay.

290
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,958
But... I don't understand this!

291
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:23,541
Shoulda known.

292
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:26,166
I thought that last attack
would've shattered your crystal,

293
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:30,375
but I suppose you are a Senior
Magic Knight, after all.

294
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:32,791
So you managed to keep it
from crumbling apart

295
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:35,541
and stopped yourself
from going unconscious.

296
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,958
What a good boy!

297
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:40,041
Unfortunately though,
it seems you and your

298
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:43,000
precious crystal are
on your last legs.

299
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:44,958
And since you never
know what surprises

300
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:46,583
might be lurking
around the corner,

301
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:49,791
it's in my best interest
to destroy said crystal.

302
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:55,041
Stop it!

303
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:56,875
An impudent villain
like you could never

304
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:59,000
get the best of me!
Why you little--!

305
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,083
Funny you should say that,

306
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:02,750
because that's exactly
what I just did.

307
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:04,583
Pitiful.

308
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:07,250
Don't you have enough
imagination to handle a spell

309
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,791
you're not familiar with?

310
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:12,166
A good Magic Knight is
supposed to be prepared

311
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,458
for any possibility.

312
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:17,000
You should know you can't
win by throwing a tantrum

313
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:19,750
and firing off a bunch
of heavy-duty attacks.

314
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:24,125
Pal, if you lost to me,
you're no Magic Knight at all.

315
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:25,625
I'll kill you!

316
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:28,833
His magic... It's Ash type!

317
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:30,875
[MIMOSA] That means the
Trap magic that hit Asta

318
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:34,375
before must have been his doing!

319
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:37,208
This has been fun,
but I'm bored.

320
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:40,208
Better luck next time,
ya piece of garbage.

321
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,750
Damn it all!

322
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:47,666
You know what,
on second thought...

323
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,166
[ZORA]
I may not have come here to win,

324
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:54,333
but I do have a very
specific purpose in mind.

325
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:58,875
[gasps] What's the
meaning of this?

326
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:04,041
Just kidding, loser!

327
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:08,958
[gasps]

328
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,375
[BOTH gasp]

329
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:14,083
[EMCEE MAGE] The crystal's
magic has been cut off!

330
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,166
Team B's the winner!

331
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,333
What kind of power does
that guy have, anyway?

332
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:28,708
It amplified his enemy's magic
and sent it right back at him!

333
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:30,166
I couldn't make
much sense of it,

334
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,208
but that was most impressive.

335
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:34,583
The masked man's
Royal Knights material.

336
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:37,625
He's my first pick.

337
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:39,708
I'm glad Asta's team
won the first match,

338
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:41,875
but I'm frustrated
at the same time!

339
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,000
Then again, all it takes
to make me feel better

340
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:46,791
is a little more food!

341
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:50,625
[ZORA laughs]

342
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:54,000
Hey! We were pretty
solid back there.

343
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:56,625
Teamwork really does make
the dream work, right?

344
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,708
You were the best decoys
a guy could ask for.

345
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:02,875
I mean, did you see his face?

346
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:05,916
He was so sure I wasn't
gonna break that thing.

347
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:08,458
[ASTA]
Thanks, Mimosa.

348
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:10,333
Uh, sure.

349
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:18,875
Look, mister! I've had
enough of your attitude!

350
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:21,916
You can't treat a fellow
Magic Knight like that!

351
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,666
Their team fought hard
and did a good job!

352
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,291
So what if they did,
a loss is a loss.

353
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:29,666
At the end of the day,
we had better teamwork,

354
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,750
so we wiped the floor with 'em.

355
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:33,041
Be happy, you little runt.

356
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:35,958
Oh really, teamwork?
Listen to you!

357
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:38,166
That trap I walked into
near the end was created

358
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,916
by your magic, wasn't it?

359
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,250
How could you do that
to your own teammate?

360
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:43,625
[ZORA]
I just needed you to serve

361
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:46,916
as the decoy to set it off.
You know what they say.

362
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,500
To trick your foes, you gotta
start with your friends.

363
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,000
[ASTA]
Who says that?!

364
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:54,583
Oh, and I've got one more
surprise for you in my collar.

365
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,625
Ow, why do you keep trickin' me?

366
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:57,791
You're the worst!

367
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:59,541
Jeez, my eyes feel
like they're burning!

368
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:02,541
--Asta!
--[ZORA laughs]

369
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:04,375
Man, I swear that
never gets old!

370
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:05,958
[MIMOSA]
I think I see now.

371
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:08,166
He draws a magic circle
somewhere on the terrain

372
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:11,458
or on an object and infuses
it with the power of a spell.

373
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:13,416
Then as soon as certain
conditions are met,

374
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,208
the trap is triggered.

375
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:18,125
[NARRATOR] Correct.
Near the end of the battle,

376
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:22,000
Asta inadvertently activated
a trap designed to target

377
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:24,833
any opposing spells
infiltrating that territory

378
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:27,458
within a predetermined
time period.

379
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:31,500
This ability is known
as Counter Trap Magic.

380
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:35,125
It doubles the speed and power
of any spells it reflects.

381
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,125
So, the stronger
the foe's attack,

382
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:39,208
the more deadly the result.

383
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:44,916
[MIMOSA] For such a
large-scale Trap Magic spell,

384
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,791
you'd need massive amounts
of time and magic power.

385
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:49,708
When did you manage to do it?

386
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:52,041
After all, you were sleeping
for most of the fight!

387
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:57,041
[laughs] I kinda prefer
to stay mysterious.

388
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:59,208
I'll give ya mysterious,
ya big jerk!

389
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:01,166
I'll knock that super cool
mask right off your face,

390
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,416
--you hear me?
--[MIMOSA] I think it'd be

391
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,708
more convincing if you
didn't compliment him.

392
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:07,375
[ASTA] Come back here and
tell us everything right now!

393
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:08,541
Or I'll punch ya!

394
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,500
[MAGNA]
Give it a rest, Asta.

395
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:14,083
Seriously, do you have
to be so loud 24/7?

396
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:15,291
You guys have had your fun,

397
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:17,125
and now it's our turn
to tear it up.

398
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:18,333
Move aside, would ya?

399
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:20,000
You know, you're kinda
cocky for a twerp

400
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:21,083
with ugly purple glasses.

401
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:22,458
They're not ugly, they're cool,

402
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:25,166
and you just wish
you had some, too!

403
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,666
I don't have to take this
crap from you, Giant Girl!

404
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,125
You only think I'm giant because
you're so short and wimpy.

405
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:34,083
Who're you callin' wimpy, huh?
I'll make you eat those words!

406
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,833
Oh, hey, it's Magna!
And Giant Girl!

407
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:39,916
Wait. Where's your third member?

408
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:46,125
[KIRSCH]
Honestly.

409
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:49,750
Every last one of you is
desperately devoid of style.

410
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,666
Ugh. Kill me.

411
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,166
My, what an eyesore.

412
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,375
I'll thank you not to
interfere with the splendor

413
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:59,750
of the magnificent
Kirsch Vermillion!

414
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:02,708

Okay. Why is he sparkling?

[gasps]

416
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:05,375
Did he say "Vermillion"?

417
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:08,083
Sadly, this is my older brother.

418
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,041
For real?

419
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:10,500
I wish I wasn't.

420
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:14,375
I'm so beautiful!
I can't stand it!

421
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:17,250
[laughs]

422
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:19,875
He kinda brightens
everything up, doesn't he?

423
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:22,666
I'd be much happier
if he disappeared.
