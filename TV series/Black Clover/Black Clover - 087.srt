[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,000
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:24,458
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:27,125
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:35,583
[NARRATOR] After his triumph,
he was hailed

6
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:39,708
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,833
[NARRATOR] After hearing Yami's
tale about how never

8
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:45,625
giving up can open new doors,

9
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:49,000
Asta was filled with fresh
resolve to face his rival.

10
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:50,541
[ASTA]
All right!

11
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:53,666
Time to work hard, catch up to
Yuno, and leave him behind!

12
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:54,541
[NARRATOR]
Just then...

[banging]

14
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:58,875
[MAGNA] Damn! That's the
biggest owl I've ever heard!

15
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:00,458
Quit bangin' the door down.

16
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:02,416
If you're lookin' for Captain
Yami's Black Bulls,

17
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,791
then you came to the right--

18
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:07,125
Whoa, what just happened?

19
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:12,875
[ASTA] Hey, I recognize her!
That's Fuegoleon's sister!

20
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,291
Dude. What is this about?

21
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:52,375
Is the Captain of the Crimson
Lion Kings really here?

22
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:53,458
[LUCK]
Mm-hm.

23
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,041
Yeah, Captain,
why're you showin' up

24
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:57,208
on our doorstep out of nowhere?

25

It's Mereoleona!

[YAMI] Hey, why's it so damn
noisy in here all of a sudden?

28
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:07,166
Sheesh, can't a guy
even take a du-- Oh.

29
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,000
Dangerous animal on the loose!

30
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:12,250
Everybody, hurry up and get
outta the building now!

31
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:14,750
Trust me, if you get caught,
just play dead!

32
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,791
Don't make eye contact
or it'll eat--

33
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:17,875
Ow!

34
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:21,791
[MEREOLEONA]
Shut up and take this, moron.

35
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:22,958
[YAMI]
What is it?

36
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:24,500
Lemme guess, it's some
kinda poison drink

37
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:25,916
that'll tear holes in my throat

38
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,708
and make me spit
fireballs, right?

39
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,458
[MEREOLEONA]
It's for visiting my brother!

40
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:32,208
Do you have a death wish?

41
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:34,708
I don't need a thank-you
present for that.

42
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:37,000
Besides, if this is what
a beast like you drinks,

43
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,875
I guarantee it's not fit
for human consumption.

44
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:41,000
Don't want it.

45
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:42,583
[MEREOLEONA]
Then I'll kill you!

46
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:44,458
So you came here to thank
me and you've already

47
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:45,708
moved on to killing me?

48
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:47,583
I'll thank you then kill you.

49
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:49,333
[YAMI]
Man, you do not joke around!

50
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:51,166
That's because I hate jokes.

51
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:54,041
Captain! You sure
you don't want this?

52
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:56,958
Fine. I'll take it! [hiccups]

54
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:00,625
Oh, I understand now,
you're only here to talk

55
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:03,333
to Captain Yami,
that's all! What a relief!

56
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:05,125
And here I thought I was
about to get dragged off

57
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:07,125
to somewhere crazy agai--!

--[LUCK laughing]

I don't like this!
Where are we goin'?

63
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:17,083
It's somewhere bad,
I just know it!

64
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:21,750
Wait! Why am I getting
dragged off, too?

65
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:24,000
Maybe there's gonna be a fight!

[NOELLE groaning]

67
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:27,291
[whispering] I just made
everyone some tea,

68
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:28,916
but I guess you're
heading out now.

69
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Hey, Captain!

70
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:31,625
This madwoman is
trying to kidnap

71
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:32,791
three of your squad members.

72
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:34,541
Don't you think you
should do something?

73
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:37,041
As long as she leaves,
she can do whatever she wants.

74
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:38,750
[ASTA] What do you mean she
can do whatever she wants?

75
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,583
If you don't help us,
we're gonna be barbecued!

76
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,833
Come on, Captain, you
can't let her do that!

77
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:45,625
[laughs] If it's only
you three she wants,

78
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,791
then you guys musta done
somethin' really rotten!

You deserve this,
especially you, Luck!

80
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,416
These are the squad
members who passed

81
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,000
the Royal Knights
Selection Exam.

[MAGNA screams]

83
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:56,958
Huh?

84
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:58,041
We made it?

85
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:00,500
So we're in the Royal Knights?

86
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:02,625
That means even though
I lost the tournament,

87
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:04,458
Yuno didn't get ahead of me!

88
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:06,041
We're still neck-and-neck
in the race

89
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:08,916
to be the next Wizard King!

This is great!

[NOELLE] Yay! I'm so
happy I made the cut!

92
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,833
Now Asta and I can finally--!

93
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,208
Uh, I mean, not that I care
about anything like that!

94
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:20,750
I'm glad Asta passed the exam,

95
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:22,833
but only because I'm proud
of him as a squadmate!

That's all he is to me, really!

Nothing more and nothing less!

be awesome Royal Knights!

and ruin things for
the rest of us.

103

I won't! But I've been
training super hard,

104
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,333
so it'll still turn
out okay if I do!

105

Idiot! What part of "don't do
it" did you not understand?

Sorry!

Actually, wait.

There was supposed to
be one more Black Bull

Ha! Aw, too bad for you, Magna!

122

Working with the Royal Knights
is gonna make me even stronger,

a match for me anymore.

Yes! I'm fired up!

in "mushroom"!

[MEREOLEONA]
Representing the Aqua Deer,

As well as Fragil Tormenta!

--Here.
--Yep. That's me!

166

I'm the failure who lost even
though he's a captain.

Please, sir!

Now's the time to dig
deep and stay strong.

And from the Golden
Dawn, Hamon Caseus,

Vermillion, and Yuno!

[KLAUS, MIMOSA, YUNO, HAMON]
Here!

173
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:06,416
Ha, ha! I see our squad
is the most represented

174
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,541
among this group.

175
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:10,125
Well, we are the
best of the best.

176
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:11,833
Can't say I'm surprised.

177
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:14,250
It's only natural they'd
want you on the team!

178
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,000
I mean, you were
basically the MVP

179
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:17,708
of the whole tournament!

180
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,333
Hey, are you listening?!

181
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:20,833
Now then, the Black Bulls.

[LUCK, NOELLE, ASTA]
Here!

185
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:27,708
How's that, Yuno?

186
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:30,208
No way am I gonna let
you leave me in the dust!

187
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:32,583
Even if I stumble,
I'll keep on goin'!

188
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:34,000
And then stumble again.

189
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:35,625
He is pretty good at that.

190
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,875
[ASTA] Really, you
think so? Thanks a lot.

191
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:39,375
Wait, what did you say?

192
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:40,833
You know it's the truth.

193
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:43,041
Okay, but I'm good at
not givin' up, too!

194
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:45,291
[NOELLE] I can vouch
for the stumbling part.

195
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:48,083
Oh, Asta. I'm so happy
you and I get a chance

196
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:49,666
to work together again!

197
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,458
Yeah! Should be fun!

198
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:52,500
[NOELLE grumbles]

199
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:54,916
Let me introduce
myself as well.

200
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,875
As you may know, I am
Mereoleona Vermillion.

201
00:08:57,958 --> 00:08:59,708
The Captain of
the Royal Knights!

202
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:01,041
No way!

203
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,708
I didn't know she would be
in charge of this thing!

204
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:06,291
Come on. Are you guys
not surprised?

205
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:08,958
No. I had assumed
it would be her.

206
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:10,625
She was the one
who came to get us

207
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:12,208
and now she's doing
the roll call.

208
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:13,541
What's wrong?

209
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:16,375
Nothin'! Everything's
peachy, Captain, I swear!

210
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,750
Our Captain really is
something special.

211
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:21,166
She was the one who rallied
the Crimson Lion Kings

212
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,625
after what happened
to Captain Fuegoleon.

213
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:25,791
Right.

214
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,583
[KLAUS] I personally wish
that title had gone

215
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:30,250
to our Captain Vangeance,
but he's busy commanding

216
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:33,708
security forces in the capital.
So she'll have to do.

217
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:36,625
If anyone has a complaint,
then please don't hold back.

218
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:40,791
I certainly won't hold back
when I crush you for it!

219
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,166
[YUNO]
Really?

220
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,708
[MEREOLEONA] Now then,
let's get back to business.

221

After enduring a cutthroat
competition,

222
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:50,250
you 16 have been selected
to be a part of this team.

223

Assuming there are
no objections,

224
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,208
I hereby announce
myself as your leader,

225
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:55,416
from this moment until

226

the Eye of the Midnight
Sun is annihilated!

[ROYAL MAGIC KNIGHTS]
Yes, ma'am!

228
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:03,333
[MEREOLEONA] Hm? One, two,
three. Someone's missing.

229
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:05,500
Does he think
promptness is a joke?

230
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:09,208
[ZORA]
I'm a bit late. Sorry, guys.

[MEREOLEONA grunts]

232
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:19,708
Well, well. A class clown.

233
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,791
Heh. Come on,
let's be reasonable.

234
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:26,041
If I'm entrusting my life
to you, I'd be stupid

235
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,750
not to find out
what you're made of.

236
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:30,125
Anyway, the pleasure's all mine.

wearin' a Black Bulls robe?

You! Explain to me why you're
wearin' that robe, right now!

242

Idiot. I'm one of
the Black Bulls,

243
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:53,583
why wouldn't I be
wearin' the uniform?

244

[ASTA, NOELLE]
Huh?

245
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:56,375
Wow!

246
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:58,791
You're a Black Bull?
Like, our Black Bulls?

247
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:02,000
That's it! I want to know
everything in detail!

248
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:05,250
[laughs] All of a sudden,
you got me feelin' nostalgic

249
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:07,541
for the old days.
I used to go around

250
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,958
beatin' the daylights outta
Magic Knights one by one,

251
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:12,000
and I had some pretty
good reasons for doin' it.

252
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:14,166
You hurt Magic Knights, really?

253
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,250
That is not okay--

254
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:16,625
Chill out.

255
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:18,833
I just told you I had a good
reason for it, didn't I?

256
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:20,333
Here's what happened.

257
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:22,875
Not too long ago,
I ran into this outrageous

258
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:26,333
monster of a guy and ended up
takin' a serious beating.

[panting]

260
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,541
What's your problem?

00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:34,500
What's this?

262
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:37,500
I like ya, so I want to
give you one of these.

263
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:39,916
If you don't like it,
you can toss it.

264
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,125
[ZORA] Stop playin' games
with me, Magic Knight!

265

Like I'd be caught dead in this!

266
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:45,500
Besides, I don't think
you're supposed to go

267
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:48,333
handing these things
out like candy!

268
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:51,041
Oh, I wasn't expecting
you to know that.

[gasping]

270
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:53,958
Well, if you ever do
feel like putting it on,

271
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:55,791
then be my guest.

272
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,000
And that's how it went down.

273
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,125
Captain Yami scouted me
for the Black Bulls

274
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:06,250
and made me an official
member of the squad.

275
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:07,791
But that's not fair, Xerx!

00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:09,583
You're obviously playin' dirty!

277

I had to work so hard to get in!

278
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:14,083
Yeah, by the way,
my name's not Xerx.

Heh. If I'm not mistaken, that's
exactly what I just said, runt.

You know what they say.

to start with your friends.

higher ranked than me?

So start grovelin'.

uniforms and everything?

314
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:30,500
This day keeps gettin'
cooler by the minute!

315
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:32,000
They were designed
for our fight against

316
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:33,583
the Eye of the Midnight Sun.

317
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:35,500
Which means they'll be
exceptionally resistant

318
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:36,708
to magic attacks.

319
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:39,500
Now quit wasting my time
and go put yours on!

320
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:41,833
[BELL]
Hey! Check this out!

321
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:43,291
[BELL]
Handsome, huh?

322
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:44,916
This thing is practically
made for him.

323
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,416
I've fallen in love
all over again!

324
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,000
[ASTA gasps]

325
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:50,625
I never imagined you
and I would be wearing

326
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,250
the same robe, Asta.

327
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:56,041
It's not like you'll ever hold a
candle to my magic abilities.

328
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,500
I'm going to become
the next Wizard King.

329
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:01,083
No way. I will!

330
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:02,833
Keep dreaming.

331
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,458
All right! Is everyone
wearing their robes now?

332
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:11,291
Ah, it's so beautiful.

333
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:14,541
To think a mere manmade garment
would suit a god so perfectly!

334
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,166
To think your narcissism
would give me

335
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,083
such a perfect urge to puke!

336
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:20,041
They certainly make it official.

337
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,083
And I must say, they're
awfully flattering

338
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:24,458
on those of us who sport
a more robust figure.

339
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:27,458
That's right!
I'm ready for anything!

340
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,250
I suppose they're
not too terrible.

341
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:31,125
Hey, uh...

342
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:33,000
How come mine is so short?

343
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:35,125
Yours is the only one like that!

344
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,125
Asta, don't joke around.

345
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:40,625
But I'm not joking! This is just
how it was when I put it on!

346
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:43,291
[laughing] I guess when
you're half a man,

347
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:45,083
you only get half a robe.

348
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:47,208
We ran out of fabric.

349
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:49,916
You see, apart from you lot,
we ended up calling upon

350
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,666
some extra people to help out.

351
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,791
--[ASTA] Extra people?
--[NOELLE] Some extra people?

352
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,166
These Magic Knights may not

353
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,458
have participated in
the selection exam,

354
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:01,583
but their special skills
will be indispensable.

355
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:05,416
Meet Cob Portaport
and Shiren Tium.

356
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,708
Shiren's Stone Creation
Magic can summon

357
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:10,208
a mockup of the enemy's hideout,
and give us an idea

358
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:13,708
of the magic power possessed
by the mages hiding inside.

359
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:17,083
And Cob can wield the
ever-useful Spatial Magic.

360
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,375
We've enlisted his support
since Finral Roulacase

361
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:22,166
is still in recovery.

362
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:25,041
Last but not least,

363
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,708
Nozel Silva!

364
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:29,416
He'll be joining us as well.

365
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,375
[NOELLE]
My brother's here?

366
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:34,000
The Silver Eagles captain
will be fighting with us?

367
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,541
I'm glad we have him!

368
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,041
Definitely!

369
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:39,583
Having the opportunity to
fight with somebody like him--

370
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:41,500
it's really an honor!

371
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,791
I was certain you would
refuse my offer.

372
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,833
What caused you to
change your mind?

373
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:48,125
Please spare me
the idle chit-chat.

374
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:51,375
I'm only acting on orders
from His Majesty.

375
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:54,166
With these three,
the Royal Knights are complete.

376
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,416
I'm expecting great things!

377
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,916
Hey! That's not very
nice of you, Nozel.

378
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,833
What makes you think you
can just waltz in here

379
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:02,416
and become one of
the Royal Knights?

380
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,416
I mean, you didn't even compete
in the selection exam!

381
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,541
A better question is why
you chose to take the test

382
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:10,083
in the first place,
despite being a Captain.

383
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:13,166
Huh?! I thought that
was the only way in!

384
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,875
Salutations!

385
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,250
The Eye of the Midnight
Sun is strong!

386
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:19,291
So we're lucky to have
the help of our fearless

387
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:21,125
Magic Knight Captains,
especially those who

388
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:22,375
possess royal blood!

389
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:24,791
You are called the
Royal Knights, after all.

390
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:25,750
Get it?

391
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,625
Hey, it's the King!

392
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:29,708
Let's give a warm
welcome to His Majesty,

393
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:33,125
King Augustus Kira Clover
the Thirteenth.

394
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:35,791
[KING CLOVER] Oh, dear!
She's terribly intimidating!

395
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:38,458
I'm not used to being
addressed by my full name!

396
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:40,250
Listen well, Knights!

397
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,166
You mustn't sully
the proud name of--

398
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,125
As I'm sure you're aware,

399
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:47,458
victory is all we need!
The Eye of the Midnight Sun

400
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:50,125
is a contemptible
terrorist organization!

401
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,541
If we don't pull it up
by the roots ourselves,

402
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:55,541
our nation will
never know peace!

403
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,625
We may have successfully
banded together

404
00:16:57,708 --> 00:17:00,666
to drive them out during the
attack on the royal capital,

405
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,000
but the cost was
unspeakably great.

406
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:05,333
My fool of a brother, Fuegoleon,

407
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:09,000
fell for their scheme and
remains bedridden to this day!

408
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:10,333
Based on what
we've learned from

409
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:12,458
the operatives we've
captured thus far,

410
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:14,416
their leader is a
mage called Licht,

411
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,083
who carries a
four-leaf grimoire!

412
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:18,583
Their three mightiest fighters

413
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:20,916
once made up a group
called the Third Eye.

414
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
The Eye of the Midnight
Sun intends to gather

415
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,875
magic stones because they
believe that doing so

416
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:28,916
will allow them to be reborn
into their "true forms,"

417
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,041
and come to possess
incredible power.

418
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:34,375
They have all but three stones.

419
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:36,166
Fortunately, we've
been able to recover

420
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,041
two of them before
they were located.

421
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:40,583
What's more, we defeated
the Third Eye's Vetto,

422
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:42,208
a wielder of Beast Magic.

423
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:43,875
And, for now,
we've deterred Fana

424
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:47,250
and her Fire Spirit, Salamander.

425
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,000
The final member
of the Third Eye

426
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:51,625
is the Copy Magic
user known as Rhya.

427
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:54,333
He and their leader Licht
are, without a doubt,

428
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:56,375
the greatest and most
powerful enemies

429
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:59,166
we'll face during our campaign.

430
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,083
Their stronghold is the last
line of defense they have.

431
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,125
If we attack it,
the enemy is likely

432
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:07,500
to put up all-out resistance.
We may see some casualties,

433
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:10,166
but victory will still
be ours in the end!

434
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,875
Every life in the
kingdom is at stake!

435
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,291
If anyone here is
uncomfortable with that,

436
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:18,458
then I'll kill you now and
save the enemy the trouble!

437
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:19,958
Are you ready?

438
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:21,750
[ROYAL MAGIC KNIGHTS]
Ma'am!

439
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,916
And now, His Majesty

Oh! There's no need
to raise your voice!

I'm done, feel free to
continue with your address.

[KING CLOVER]
"Continue," she tells me!

445
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:39,166
After she so rudely interrupted
me with such a lengthy spiel!

00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,750
Why, there's nothing
left for me to say!

Ahem! Well, do your
best, Royal Knights!

Hm.

Where do we find

the Eye of the Midnight
Sun's hideout, anyway?

[KING CLOVER]
Oh, my!

For a vexatious commoner,

Rest assured, we will
be making our way

to their base immediately!

459

Listen up! It lies in the
floating dungeon found within

460
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:13,666
the strong magic region
called Gravito Stones!

[RHYA yawns]
Wow, it sure is late.

Hey, Rhya!

463
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,875
As I expected,
you're wearing the same

464
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:31,833
cowardly expression as usual.

465

[RHYA]
Aw, come on, don't be like that.

466
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,291
We should go get
some drinks together.

No. Forget it.

470
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:47,375
Hello, Rhya.

471
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:49,000
What took ya so long?

472
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:51,375
Let me guess, waking up
is a pain, too, now?

473
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:52,625
You're the worst.

474
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:55,666
[RHYA]
Get off my case. Hey, Patry.

475
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,458
I can see you're still
clinging onto Licht

476
00:19:57,541 --> 00:20:00,208
like nobody's business.

477
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:02,291
He's gonna belong to a
human after tomorrow's

478
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:05,333
big ceremony, so you better
start letting go of him.

479
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:07,041
Leave me alone, Rhya.

480
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:09,500
That's my choice to
make, not yours.

481
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:10,791
[RHYA]
Excuse me?

482
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:12,791
It's all right, even
after we get married,

483
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:15,250
Licht will still
belong to everybody.

484
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:18,458
[RHYA] Man, human princesses
are so generous.

485
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:21,250
I'd be careful what I say if
I were you, though, Tetia.

486
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:22,750
Before long, there
won't be any room

487
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:25,166
in his busy schedule
to spend time with you.

488
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,458
You don't have to be
so blunt about things.

489
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:29,291
Patry knows what to expect.

490
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:30,708
So what's it like?

491
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:33,916
Knowing that you'll be a father
in a few months' time?

492
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I can sense that the mana
has blessed our lives, as well.

493
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:38,583
When our child arrives,

494
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:40,791
we know that your kind
will welcome it.

495
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,458
We're quite thrilled.

496
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:43,750
[TETIA laughs]

497
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:46,708
This little one here is
the key to our future.

498
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:49,333
The bridge to unite
elves and humankind!

499
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,708
[RHYA] Congratulations,
Licht and Tetia!

500
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:53,041
[VETTO, FANA, PATRY, RILL]
Congratulations!

501
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:55,166
[LICHT, TETIA laugh]

502
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:58,833
[RHYA gasping]

503
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:03,875
That was odd. What a dream.

504
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:06,416
Kinda faint, though.

505
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,750
It's almost time to wake up.

506
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:42,750
[FULL CAST]

[MEREOLEONA, ASTA]
"Robes Aplenty. Part 1"!

508
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:51,083
Wow, we get special police
uniforms and everything?

509
00:22:51,166 --> 00:22:53,708
This day keeps gettin'
cooler by the minute!

510
00:22:53,791 --> 00:22:55,416
They were designed
for investigating

511
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,958
criminal activity.
Now go and put yours on!

512
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:03,041
This doesn't feel right!

513
00:23:03,125 --> 00:23:05,791
Why is mine different
than all the other ones?

514
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:07,291
[MEREOLEONA, ASTA]
Part 2!

515
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:10,125
Wow, so we get special
school uniforms now?

516
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:13,291
That's way cooler than
what you gave me before!

517
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:16,208
They're made for wearing
to academic institutions.

518
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:18,250
Now go and put yours on!

519
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:23,541
Hold on a second, how
young do you think I am?

520
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:25,000
[MEREOLEONA, ASTA]
Part 3!

521
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:28,291
Wow, so we get special
doctor uniforms to wear?

522
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:31,708
I'm pretty sure it doesn't
get much cooler than that!

523
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:34,625
These outfits are designed
for practicing medicine.

524
00:23:34,708 --> 00:23:36,833
Now go and put yours on!

525
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:40,708
Ugh, really?

526
00:23:40,791 --> 00:23:42,791
Why can't I have a cool one?

527
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:44,666
[YUNO]
This might hurt.

528
00:23:46,416 --> 00:23:49,291
[ASTA] Finally, it's time for
us to fight the Midnight Sun!

529
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:51,416
No matter what, the Royal
Knights are gonna protect

530
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,750
the Kingdom and everyone in it!

534
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:00,833
And scary, too!
