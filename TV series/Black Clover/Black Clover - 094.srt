1
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,432
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:25,515 --> 00:00:28,518
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:32,105 --> 00:00:34,399
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:34,482 --> 00:00:37,110
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:43,491 --> 00:00:45,452
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:45,535 --> 00:00:49,622
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:53,585
[NARRATOR] Asta and the
rest of the Royal Knights

8
00:00:53,668 --> 00:00:54,627
were busy infiltrating

9
00:00:54,711 --> 00:00:57,213
the Eye of the Midnight
Sun's hideout.

10
00:00:57,297 --> 00:00:59,758
While Licht, who had just
revealed his true identity,

11
00:00:59,841 --> 00:01:02,385
was in the royal capital,
engaged in a vicious battle

12
00:01:02,469 --> 00:01:06,181
with Julius over possession
of the magic stones.

13
00:01:06,264 --> 00:01:09,934
[LICHT]
But how? What is this strength?

14
00:01:10,018 --> 00:01:14,022
He's only human.
He shouldn't be able to--

15
00:01:14,105 --> 00:01:15,690
[NARRATOR]
Using his coverless grimoire

16
00:01:15,774 --> 00:01:17,942
and Time Magic abilities,

17
00:01:18,026 --> 00:01:20,362
Julius managed to
secure the upper hand.

18
00:01:20,445 --> 00:01:23,073
And as the Wizard King,

19
00:01:23,156 --> 00:01:27,869
I'll protect the people
of Clover. Come what may.

20
00:01:27,952 --> 00:01:29,120
[NARRATOR]
However,

21
00:01:29,204 --> 00:01:30,872
Licht released himself
from his Sealing spell

22
00:01:30,955 --> 00:01:32,082
to launch a deadly attack

23
00:01:32,165 --> 00:01:34,834
on every person in
the Clover Kingdom.

24
00:01:34,918 --> 00:01:37,337
[YAMI] That's a big
hunk o' Light Magic.

25
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:38,630
Dammit!

26
00:01:38,713 --> 00:01:43,343
Now. Here is your
punishment, humans!

27
00:01:43,426 --> 00:01:47,722
Light Magic: Arrows of Judgment!

28
00:01:49,265 --> 00:01:53,561
[JULIUS] Time Reversal Magic:
Chrono Anastasis!

29
00:01:53,645 --> 00:01:55,522
[NARRATOR] Julius used
all the time and power

30
00:01:55,605 --> 00:01:58,817
he'd been saving up to protect
the helpless civilians,

31
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,945
but that was exactly what
Licht wanted him to do.

32
00:02:02,028 --> 00:02:05,156
[LICHT] You would've seen
this attack of mine coming.

33
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,660
But, unfortunately, you
weren't able to call off

34
00:02:08,743 --> 00:02:12,956
that final Time Magic spell
in order to get out of the way.

35
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:16,960
Because you're the Wizard King.

36
00:02:17,043 --> 00:02:18,586
[YAMI gasps]

37
00:02:22,716 --> 00:02:26,678
[YAMI] What happened here?
Tell me, Vangeance!

38
00:04:03,191 --> 00:04:05,777
Salutations. Yami, is it?

39
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,613
You may call me Licht.

40
00:04:08,697 --> 00:04:09,989
You're Licht?

41
00:04:10,073 --> 00:04:13,368
William is lying dormant
within this body.

42
00:04:14,369 --> 00:04:15,745
[LICHT]
That's right.

43
00:04:15,829 --> 00:04:18,873
You and I both watched it
through these eyes, William.

44
00:04:18,957 --> 00:04:21,459
The end of the Wizard King.

45
00:04:21,543 --> 00:04:23,837
[YAMI]
What? If that's the case,

46
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,131
then you better
say your prayers!

47
00:04:28,299 --> 00:04:30,301
This can't be happening.

48
00:04:30,385 --> 00:04:33,054
There's no way this is real.

49
00:04:33,138 --> 00:04:36,182
Not Julius. Please, no.

50
00:04:36,266 --> 00:04:37,851
Don't just stand there, Marx!

51
00:04:37,934 --> 00:04:39,019
[MARX gasps]

52
00:04:39,102 --> 00:04:40,270
He's injured!

53
00:04:40,353 --> 00:04:42,522
Go get that quack Owen
to come and heal him!

54
00:04:42,605 --> 00:04:44,107
Hurry up!

55
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,151
Right!

56
00:04:46,234 --> 00:04:47,861
Hang tight, Julius! We--

57
00:04:47,944 --> 00:04:50,030
[LICHT]
Don't bother.

58
00:04:50,113 --> 00:04:53,116
He'll be gone in
mere moments now.

59
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,036
You protected your kingdom
to the very end.

60
00:04:56,119 --> 00:04:58,121
I must commend you for that,

61
00:04:58,204 --> 00:05:00,498
Julius Novachrono.

62
00:05:01,499 --> 00:05:03,084
[grunts]

63
00:05:03,168 --> 00:05:04,502
[LICHT]
But...

64
00:05:05,712 --> 00:05:06,921
Master Licht, sir!

65
00:05:07,005 --> 00:05:08,631
[YAMI]
Dark Magic...

66
00:05:10,967 --> 00:05:12,344
Now, Dark Cloaked.

67
00:05:12,427 --> 00:05:15,472
Elves and humankind will
never live in harmony again.

68
00:05:15,555 --> 00:05:16,806
It's over.

69
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:18,850
[YAMI]
Dimension Slash!

70
00:05:25,357 --> 00:05:27,400
[YAMI growls]

71
00:05:27,484 --> 00:05:29,736
[YAMI]
He's gone.

72
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:32,781
[YAMI] Hold on, all right?
Don't die on me!

73
00:05:33,865 --> 00:05:39,120
Ya... mi. That spell
you did was amazing.

74
00:05:39,204 --> 00:05:42,415
You can cut through
space itself.

75
00:05:42,499 --> 00:05:45,168
C'mon, this is no
time for that stuff!

76
00:05:45,251 --> 00:05:50,674
You've turned into a superb
Magic Knight, haven't you?

77
00:05:50,757 --> 00:05:51,966
Julius.

78
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:55,011
Like I keep tellin' ya,
I'm 28 years old!

79
00:05:55,095 --> 00:05:57,889
I'm not some kid anymore.

80
00:05:57,972 --> 00:06:01,309
[JULIUS] It's so inspiring
seeing that your generation

81
00:06:01,393 --> 00:06:03,603
was raised right.

82
00:06:03,687 --> 00:06:08,358
And knowing the next one
is beginning to bud as well.

83
00:06:08,441 --> 00:06:11,569
My own hopes, living on through

84
00:06:11,653 --> 00:06:14,239
all of the Magic
Knights to come...

85
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:19,953
[MEREOLEONA] Mana Zone:
Calidos Brachium Barrage!

[MEREOLEONA yells]

87
00:06:23,665 --> 00:06:25,709
[MEREOLEONA]
What's wrong, Mr. Third Eye?

88
00:06:25,792 --> 00:06:26,918
Running out of spells?

89
00:06:27,002 --> 00:06:28,294
[RHYA grunts]

90
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:31,381
Yeah, he's finished.

91
00:06:31,464 --> 00:06:35,176
[RHYA] No time to use Fast
Movement or Recovery Magic.

92
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:38,596
Try another attack! I dare you!

93
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,141
[ASTA] We struggled so hard
to beat the Third Eye,

94
00:06:41,224 --> 00:06:42,559
and now look!

95
00:06:42,642 --> 00:06:45,854
Captain Mereoleona,
you're so strong!

96
00:06:45,937 --> 00:06:48,148
If that's really your best,

97
00:06:48,231 --> 00:06:51,026
I'll punch you until
you're a pile of ashes!

98
00:06:51,109 --> 00:06:53,737
[RHYA]
Well, I guess that's it for me.

99
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,740
[MEREOLEONA]
Now, burn!

100
00:06:56,823 --> 00:06:59,284
[RHYA] I'll give you
one thing, Miss Royal.

101
00:06:59,367 --> 00:07:02,078
You sure know how
to pack a fiery punch.

102
00:07:02,162 --> 00:07:03,788
Which is why...

103
00:07:03,872 --> 00:07:05,123
[gasps]

104
00:07:05,206 --> 00:07:06,833
Before I burn up,

105
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,585
I'm castin' a
self-destruct spell

106
00:07:08,668 --> 00:07:10,253
and takin' you down with me!

107
00:07:10,337 --> 00:07:11,838
[yells]

108
00:07:11,921 --> 00:07:15,342
[RHYA] Once you hit me,
we'll disappear with a bang!

109
00:07:16,593 --> 00:07:18,595

[RHYA grunting]

113
00:07:23,933 --> 00:07:26,102
[RHYA]
That Anti-magic brat.

114
00:07:26,186 --> 00:07:28,229
He sniffed out my
self-destruct spell

115
00:07:28,313 --> 00:07:30,815
and countered it before
she landed her attack!

116
00:07:30,899 --> 00:07:33,818
He acted so fast--
it's incredible!

117
00:07:33,902 --> 00:07:36,488
Two other people have
already tried that,

118
00:07:36,571 --> 00:07:38,448
and I'm fed up with it!

119
00:07:38,531 --> 00:07:40,200
You can't kill
yourself on my watch,

120
00:07:40,283 --> 00:07:43,953
you three-eyed jerk! Got it?

121
00:07:44,037 --> 00:07:46,664
Don't throw your life away!

122
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:53,088
[yelling] Seriously, what's
the matter with you guys?!

123
00:07:53,171 --> 00:07:55,048
You're mad at humans
for takin' somethin' away

124
00:07:55,131 --> 00:07:56,257
from you, right?!

125
00:07:56,341 --> 00:07:58,343
I'm still fuzzy on the details!

126
00:07:58,426 --> 00:08:00,637
But we're all people!

127
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,306
I want you to tell me
your side of the story,

128
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,642
and then I'm gonna
tell you mine!

129
00:08:05,725 --> 00:08:09,104
And nobody's dyin' until
that happens, okay?

130
00:08:09,187 --> 00:08:10,355
Uh...

131
00:08:10,438 --> 00:08:11,731
Good grief.

132
00:08:11,815 --> 00:08:14,901
That pipsqueak really
runs hot, doesn't he?

133
00:08:14,984 --> 00:08:16,569
I don't recall
giving you permission

134
00:08:16,653 --> 00:08:18,530
to butt into my fight, boy.

135
00:08:18,613 --> 00:08:20,031
Should I burn you as well?

136
00:08:20,115 --> 00:08:22,158
Ah--

He's part of the
Eye of the Midnight Sun.

138

They've plunged the
kingdom into confusion

139
00:08:27,163 --> 00:08:30,375
and taken a massive
toll on its people.

140
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:33,461
They are not interested
in swapping stories.

141
00:08:33,545 --> 00:08:34,379
Now, move.

[ASTA yelps]

143
00:08:35,505 --> 00:08:38,216
Even if it means
killing them all,

144
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:40,260
we must stop them.

145
00:08:40,343 --> 00:08:42,345
Yeah? Why is that?

146
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:43,805
Huh?

147
00:08:43,888 --> 00:08:46,808
We're the same. Aren't we?

148
00:08:46,891 --> 00:08:49,686
So we should be able
to talk things over.

149
00:08:49,769 --> 00:08:52,731
Both sides are mad because
we lost someone we loved.

I've been thinkin'
a lot about this.

152
00:08:59,696 --> 00:09:02,907
Everyone's fighting because
we can't forgive the other side.

153
00:09:02,991 --> 00:09:07,245
So how do we get rid of
all that anger and hatred?

154
00:09:07,328 --> 00:09:08,788
I know I'm not very smart,

155
00:09:08,872 --> 00:09:12,042
so I can't come up
with the right answer.

156
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:13,668
But we can do it.

157
00:09:13,752 --> 00:09:16,046
I mean, we have to, don't we?

or just a commoner,

162
00:09:27,057 --> 00:09:29,601
or even if you're not a human.

163
00:09:29,684 --> 00:09:32,645
[JULIUS] It's a future that
all of you will create.

164
00:09:32,729 --> 00:09:36,691
A nation that's free
of hatred and prejudice.

165
00:09:36,775 --> 00:09:39,194
I just want a kingdom
where all of us

166
00:09:39,277 --> 00:09:41,529
get along and laugh together.

167
00:09:41,613 --> 00:09:43,823
And when I'm the Wizard
King, we'll have one.

168
00:09:43,907 --> 00:09:45,950
You'll see!

169
00:09:46,034 --> 00:09:46,868
Heh.

170
00:09:46,951 --> 00:09:48,620
[MEREOLEONA]
You imbecile.

171
00:09:48,703 --> 00:09:51,748
Proudly proclaiming
something so outrageous.

172
00:09:51,831 --> 00:09:53,166
[gasps]

173
00:09:53,249 --> 00:09:57,462
[RHYA]
I think he's actually serious!

174
00:09:57,545 --> 00:10:01,966
In fact, it reminds me of what
someone else said once before.

175
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:04,386
This little one here
is the key to our future.

176
00:10:04,469 --> 00:10:07,514
the bridge that will unite
the elves and humankind!

177
00:10:07,597 --> 00:10:09,849
[RHYA] Congratulations,
Licht and Tetia!

178
00:10:09,933 --> 00:10:11,601
[VETTO, FANA, PATRY, RILL]
Congratulations!

179
00:10:11,685 --> 00:10:14,020
[RHYA] If only the rest of the
human race thought about it

180
00:10:14,104 --> 00:10:18,483
the way these guys
do, then maybe...

181
00:10:18,566 --> 00:10:24,030
No. It's too late to stop now.

182
00:10:29,202 --> 00:10:31,162
Hey, welcome back!

183
00:10:31,246 --> 00:10:32,831
[RADES]
Took ya long enough!

184
00:10:32,914 --> 00:10:35,709
You snagged the last of
the magic stones, right?

185
00:10:35,792 --> 00:10:37,544
Watch your tongue, Rades.

186
00:10:37,627 --> 00:10:39,462
Everything went as we planned.

187
00:10:39,546 --> 00:10:41,172
In fact, even better!

188
00:10:41,256 --> 00:10:44,259
Our Master Licht has
assassinated the Wizard King!

189
00:10:44,342 --> 00:10:46,011
Seriously? That's awesome!

190
00:10:46,094 --> 00:10:49,848
Wow, Master Licht. Great going!

191
00:10:49,931 --> 00:10:51,391
[LICHT]
The time has come.

192
00:10:51,474 --> 00:10:55,228
There's not a soul who can
stand in our way anymore.

193
00:11:03,236 --> 00:11:05,905
[YAMI]
Come on! Just a little longer.

194
00:11:05,989 --> 00:11:08,825
When Owen gets here,
he's gonna fix ya right up!

195
00:11:10,577 --> 00:11:13,830
Their leader was so powerful.

196
00:11:13,913 --> 00:11:16,750
He could have easily killed
everyone in the land,

197
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:20,545
even without collecting
all of the magic stones.

198
00:11:20,628 --> 00:11:24,090
That means he must be
after something else.

199
00:11:24,174 --> 00:11:29,095
I fear that Clover Kingdom may
yet suffer a devastating fate.

200
00:11:32,057 --> 00:11:34,559
I let him steal the stones.

201
00:11:34,642 --> 00:11:40,357
I'm sorry. Such a failure
is below the Wizard King.

202
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,944
Forget that! You just
saved thousands of lives!

203
00:11:45,028 --> 00:11:47,364
[MARX] I hope we make
it to him in time.

204
00:11:48,865 --> 00:11:51,951
[JULIUS] Marx is going
to be so disappointed in me

205
00:11:52,035 --> 00:11:55,080
for the way things ended.

206
00:11:55,163 --> 00:11:57,290
It's a shame that
I won't be there

207
00:11:57,374 --> 00:12:01,002
when Fuegoleon finally wakes up.

208
00:12:01,086 --> 00:12:05,090
Yami, there are still
so many things...

209
00:12:05,173 --> 00:12:07,884
Things I wanted to tell you.

210
00:12:07,967 --> 00:12:09,594
Don't go talkin' like that!

211
00:12:09,678 --> 00:12:11,680
You can't check out on me now!

212
00:12:11,763 --> 00:12:13,973
That's somethin'
I can't forgive!

213
00:12:14,057 --> 00:12:17,060
'Cause I still haven't...

214
00:12:17,143 --> 00:12:18,520
[VILLAGER 39A]
Look at that freak.

215
00:12:18,603 --> 00:12:20,313
He's not from here, you know.

216
00:12:20,397 --> 00:12:22,440
[VILLAGER 39AA] He washed up
from some other country.

217
00:12:22,524 --> 00:12:24,526
Lives alone on the coast.

218
00:12:24,609 --> 00:12:27,153
[VILLAGER 39C] I wish he'd just
go back where he belongs.

219
00:12:28,738 --> 00:12:31,616
[JULIUS]
Wow! Was that Dark Magic?

220
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,034
What the...?

221
00:12:33,118 --> 00:12:37,080
[JULIUS giggles] Awesome!
I've never seen it before!

222
00:12:37,163 --> 00:12:39,582
Please! You've gotta let
me get a closer look.

223
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:42,252
Yeah, no. Who are you, mister?

224
00:12:42,335 --> 00:12:43,628
I, uh, well...

225
00:12:43,712 --> 00:12:46,006
I'm no one to be suspicious
of, I assure you,

226
00:12:46,089 --> 00:12:49,092
I'm just a Magic Knight captain
out walking in disguise.

227
00:12:49,175 --> 00:12:50,802
What's a Magic Knight captain?

228
00:12:50,885 --> 00:12:53,054
Huh? You don't know that?

229
00:12:53,138 --> 00:12:54,431
Okay...

230
00:12:57,684 --> 00:12:59,436
Why don't you come with
me and I'll show you?

231
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,063
I think you have real potential!

232
00:13:02,147 --> 00:13:05,066
See this, Yami? It's how
you write your name here.

233
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,110
Oh, great. I'm never
gonna remember

234
00:13:07,193 --> 00:13:09,195
a buncha squiggly
lines like that.

235
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,032
Well, if you practice,
you'll pick it up in no time!

236
00:13:12,115 --> 00:13:13,742
I don't wanna.

237
00:13:13,825 --> 00:13:17,370
Aw. But if you learn to write,
I'll buy dinner for you!

238
00:13:17,454 --> 00:13:18,621
I'm on it.

239
00:13:18,705 --> 00:13:19,914
[JULIUS chuckles]

240
00:13:20,915 --> 00:13:23,460
You haven't been on the
squad for very long,

241
00:13:23,543 --> 00:13:26,421
but I'm already astonished by
everything you've accomplished.

242
00:13:26,504 --> 00:13:29,257
That said, I'd rather
you didn't run too wild.

243
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:30,258
We've had some, well--

244
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:33,219
Uh-oh, look! It's the enemy.

245
00:13:33,303 --> 00:13:35,972
Then let's go. But
reel it in a little--

246
00:13:36,056 --> 00:13:38,725
[YAMI yells]

247
00:13:38,808 --> 00:13:41,811
Well. We'll work on that later.

248
00:13:41,895 --> 00:13:43,438
[JULIUS]
And, Yami, from this moment on,

249
00:13:43,521 --> 00:13:44,981
you will be
recognized as founder

250
00:13:45,065 --> 00:13:46,816
and leader of the Black Bulls.

251
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,027
Best of luck, Captain.

252
00:13:51,321 --> 00:13:52,739
Yami.

253
00:13:55,575 --> 00:13:58,661
I'm leaving the rest to you now.

254
00:14:11,966 --> 00:14:13,426
Yes, sir.

255
00:14:22,018 --> 00:14:27,107
I got to meet so many people
and see so many spells.

256
00:14:31,736 --> 00:14:39,077
[JULIUS]
It was a fun life. A good life.

257
00:14:44,749 --> 00:14:46,042
Julius.

258
00:14:54,634 --> 00:14:56,678
Don't you worry, friend.

259
00:14:58,013 --> 00:15:00,515
We'll keep the kingdom
safe for you.

260
00:15:03,393 --> 00:15:06,604
[COB] I can't help but
wonder how everyone's doing.

261
00:15:06,688 --> 00:15:10,442
I've been casting my Spatial
Jamming spell for several hours.

262
00:15:10,525 --> 00:15:13,528
It's getting rather difficult
to hold my arms up.

263
00:15:13,611 --> 00:15:17,532
But this is no time
for complaining!

264
00:15:17,615 --> 00:15:19,159
The Royal Knights
are in there battling

265
00:15:19,242 --> 00:15:22,454
the Eye of the Midnight Sun
with everything they've got!

266
00:15:22,537 --> 00:15:26,124
The future of the Clover Kingdom
hangs in the balance!

267
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:29,461
Please, team, do your very best!

268
00:15:33,506 --> 00:15:35,008
Hey! Look up there!

269
00:15:35,091 --> 00:15:36,593
[gasps] What's that?

270
00:15:36,676 --> 00:15:39,846
It's an abundance of mana!

271
00:15:39,929 --> 00:15:42,474
[MIMOSA] We're headed
straight for the center.

272
00:15:42,557 --> 00:15:44,517
You guys, be careful!

273
00:15:44,601 --> 00:15:48,271
I don't care who crosses us.
I'm not in the mood to lose.

274
00:15:48,355 --> 00:15:52,400
Neither am I! Let's go
knock 'em dead, Yuno!

275
00:15:54,944 --> 00:16:00,200
[heartbeats]

276
00:16:00,283 --> 00:16:02,952
[gasps] This place
is so bizarre!

277
00:16:03,036 --> 00:16:07,165
Yes. Is that a person?

278
00:16:18,635 --> 00:16:21,554
The mana... It's so...

279
00:16:21,638 --> 00:16:25,141
Yes. It's unbelievably powerful.

280
00:16:37,112 --> 00:16:40,573
All it needs now is the
last of the magic stones.

281
00:16:40,657 --> 00:16:42,617
We'll awaken our true might

282
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:47,038
with the Monument of the Tree
of Life to guide our every step.

283
00:16:47,122 --> 00:16:48,581
[VALTOS]
Yes.

284
00:16:48,665 --> 00:16:52,293
The fateful day that we've
waited for has arrived.

285
00:16:52,377 --> 00:16:53,712
Yeah, since we
were lucky enough

286
00:16:53,795 --> 00:16:55,463
to be chosen by the mana,

287
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:58,216
our magic powers are about
to go through the roof!

288
00:16:58,299 --> 00:17:00,760
Heh. This is gonna be fun.

289
00:17:00,844 --> 00:17:02,387
Those Magic Knights'll
be dead before

290
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:04,305
they even figure out
what hit 'em.

291
00:17:04,389 --> 00:17:06,766
With our new power plus
my dark magic items,

292
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:10,687
we'll be unbeatable!
Oh, I can hardly wait!

293
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:12,188
Soon, I'll get my hands on Asta

294
00:17:12,272 --> 00:17:15,191
and experiment to
my heart's content!

295
00:17:15,275 --> 00:17:16,818
[giggling]

296
00:17:16,901 --> 00:17:19,029
Enough. This newfound advantage

297
00:17:19,112 --> 00:17:21,531
is to be used solely
to establish the society

298
00:17:21,614 --> 00:17:24,951
Master Licht has envisioned.
You know, Master.

299
00:17:25,035 --> 00:17:27,537
If we'd never become
acquainted with you,

300
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:31,583
we'd still be eking out the
same lonely, pathetic existence.

301
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:33,835
Despised by everyone.

302
00:17:41,092 --> 00:17:42,510
[VALTOS]
But you...

303
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:45,930
You gladly welcomed us into
the Eye of the Midnight Sun,

304
00:17:46,014 --> 00:17:48,975
changing our lives.

305
00:17:49,059 --> 00:17:50,518
Master Licht.

306
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:54,147
I've been happy to serve, even
if we were but a small help.

307
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:56,191
Are you done yet?
Because I can only listen

308
00:17:56,274 --> 00:17:58,818
to so much kissin' up
before I puke.

309
00:17:58,902 --> 00:18:01,154
Anyway, it's lookin' like
we'll be able to wreak

310
00:18:01,237 --> 00:18:03,365
even more havoc,
so you know I'm in!

311
00:18:03,448 --> 00:18:05,116
[SALLY] And my research'll
be extra helpful

312
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,327
after we get this boost!

313
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:09,204
[chuckles]

314
00:18:09,287 --> 00:18:10,914
[LICHT]
Yes, you three have done well

315
00:18:10,997 --> 00:18:15,335
during our time together.
Thank you for that.

316

You have acted out of

your own interest

with your blind devotion to me.

All for the sake of your lousy,
