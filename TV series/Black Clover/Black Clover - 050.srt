00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:18,875
Oh, I'm sorry.

163
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,916
Am I embarrassing the
poor virgin street punk?

164
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,416
Who're you callin' a punk, huh?

165
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,708
I sure hope I can get
back to fighting soon.

166
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:28,541
I'm so hungry, I can't
even keep my eyes open.

167
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:29,875
Look at the rest of us!

168
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:31,708
You're lucky you're just hungry.

169
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:33,250
What's that?

170
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:36,666
More importantly,
how's it taste?

171
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:40,083
Man! I can't believe I got
taken outta the fight

172
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:42,666
and missed my chance to
show what I can really do.

173
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,416
Well, we did our best,
but I guess we're just

174
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,166
not at that level yet.

175
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,250
Eh.

176
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:50,041
[distant cheering]

177
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:50,916
A banquet?

178
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,208
[OCEAN DWELLERS cheering]

179
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:56,791
[FINRAL]
Huh?

180
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:03,833
[OCEAN DWELLER 50AA]
Thank you, Black Bulls!

181
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:05,250
You were all incredible!

182
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,416
You're the saviors
of the Underwater Temple!

183
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,416
How can we ever thank you?

184
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,458
That was so amazing!

185
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:16,541
[MAGNA]
I can't freakin' believe it.

186
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,583
People are actually
thanking <i>us</i> ,

187
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:20,625
the worst of the worst
Magic Knight squads.

188
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:22,500
Yeah, it's pretty cool, huh?

189
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:24,625
Makes me wanna get
a lot stronger.

190
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,833
What? Well, okay, then.

191
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:28,625
I'll get even stronger!

192
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:30,375
I'd like to see Marie more.

193
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:32,666
[GREY] I want to work
on being less shy.

194
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,791
Oh, wow, she is stunning!
And so's she!

195
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:38,541
Well it sounds like
someone's totally recovered.

196
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:43,875
[sighs] It really is nice,
having somebody thank you.

197
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:51,000
I'm sorry, Kahono.
I couldn't stop him.

198
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,750
You're my friend, and I
didn't save your voice.

199
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:56,041
Can you ever forgive me?

200
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:58,333
[gasps]

201
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:06,291
[KAHONO]
Quit being silly, Noelle.

202
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:09,125
Voice or not, you saved
my life. Thank you!

203
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:10,750
But I...

204
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:13,291
[KAHONO]
Your magic was amazing!

205
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:16,958
If it was, that's only
because I had help from you.

206
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:19,833
[KAHONO] Well, sure!
Feel free to thank me now.

207
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:21,208
[KAHONO laughs]

208
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:22,708
[gasps]

209
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:24,166
[KAHONO]
One more thing.

210
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,375
I haven't given up on my dream.

211
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:29,916
I will recover and go ashore.

212
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:33,833
[KAHONO]
I'll sing again.

213
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:36,958
No matter how long it takes,
I'll become an idol someday.

214
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:40,541
And once I am, you had better
come and watch me perform.

215
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:41,583
Okay?

216
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,166
Kahono...

217
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,166
You better believe
I'll come see you,

218
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,666
and I expect you to
save me a good seat!

219
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,000
Promise me?

220
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:55,750
[KAHONO]
I promise.

221
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:12,875
Uh... You should probably
be getting some more rest.

222
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:14,458
But I'll be back.

223
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,541
[KAHONO]
Thanks for visiting.

224
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:20,000
Okay, I'll see you later, then!

225
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:27,500
[KAHONO] Oh, I didn't
know you were awake.

226
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:28,625
What's up with you?

227
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:31,000
Your face is even
goofier than usual.

228
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,416
She looked so beautiful
when she cried,

229
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,625
and even more so
when she smiled.

230
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:38,166
Is that who everyone's
been talking about?

231
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,750
Is she the sea goddess?

232
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:42,666
I'm in love!

233
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,625
All right! My leg
has to heal now!

234
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:48,625
I need to woo her
with my dancing.

235
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:50,875
So, you'll introduce me?

236
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:53,500
Come on, sis. Help me out here.

237
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:54,625
Yeah!

238
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,166
I'm getting back in the groove!

239
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,625
[KAHONO] Mm... Something tells
me Noelle's off the market.

240
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:07,375
Whoa! Oops! Ow!

241
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:10,875
So many crazy, unexpected
things happened

242
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:12,416
on this mission,
but at least we got

243
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,958
the magic stone in the end.

244
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:17,833
Nero! Where are you going?

245
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:19,041
Wait up, you stupid bird.

246
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:22,000
You can't just fly
wherever you want to.

247
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:23,250
Honestly.

248
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:25,833
If you get lost,
don't come cryin' to me.

249
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:29,708
What's wrong?

250
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,375
[YAMI]
Whatcha need, kid?

251
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:49,333
Ah! I shoulda known
you'd sense me here!

252
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:51,208
Guess my ki gave me away.

253
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:53,500
[YAMI]
I asked you a question.

254
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,250
Now give me an answer.
Or I'll mess you up.

255
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:57,750
Wha...?

256
00:13:57,833 --> 00:14:00,750
Well, um, it's just, since
we're leaving tomorrow and all,

257
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:03,041
I wanted to check
the place out a bit.

258
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:06,666
[laughs] I've been poking
around here and there.

259
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,500
You some kind of explorer now?

260
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:11,208
Well, you find
anything interesting?

261
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,000
[ASTA]
Oh, uh, yeah, actually.

262
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:15,791
I found a fossil shaped like
a shell, was nearly swallowed

263
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:18,250
by this sea anemone,
got absolutely swarmed

264
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:19,333
by all these sea roaches.

265
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:20,291
[YAMI]
Gross!

266
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:22,458
And there's these.

267
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:26,416
They were really pretty,
and I thought, maybe...

268
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:41,833
[ASTA]
Y'know.

269
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:45,958
I can't forgive them
for what they did.

270
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:47,750
Still...

271
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:49,958
I don't really know
what it might've been,

272
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:55,333
but maybe something unforgivable
happened to them, too.

273
00:14:55,416 --> 00:15:00,208
And so now, they hate humans
and only care about revenge.

274
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:02,166
Dreams? And bonds?

275
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,250
What do humans know of those?

276
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:07,583
Don't speak such
words to me, girl!

277
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:10,000
Oh, you've done it now, human!

278
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:12,208
You may think there's
strength in numbers,

279
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:15,333
but that's just an illusion.
You have no hope!

280
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:17,916
I won't lose to you humans!

281
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,083
Your lives belong to me!

282
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:22,500
In the end,

283
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:26,083
I think maybe he was the one
who despaired the most.

284
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,250
Hey, kid, you're
an idiot, right?

285
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,041
Huh?

286
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:39,708
I said, you're an
idiot, aren't you?

287
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:42,375
Answer me or I'll mess you up.

288
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:44,583
Yes, I'm an idiot,
Captain Yami, sir!

289
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:46,291
[YAMI] An idiot doesn't
have to think too deep

290
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,416
about that kinda stuff. Got it?

291
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,958
[gasps]

292
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:55,000
[YAMI] You just focus on
following your dream.

293
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:59,000
That's it? My dream?

294
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,041
For now, anyway.

295
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,625
[yelps]

296
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:04,791
[ASTA] I can't see! And I can't
pull my headband back up!

297
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:07,000
Come on! I've got two
broken arms, remember?

298
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:09,458
Hey, Captain.
Where are you going?

299
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:13,375
Sir? Uh... You can't
just leave me here!

300
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:23,875
[ASTA] For now, all I have
to do is follow my dream.

301
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:25,583
Huh.

302
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:29,125
My dream. Except,
it's not just mine.

303
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:36,166
Check it out Yuno: I got
a snazzy new grimoire.

304
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,500
Okay, it's a little beat-up,

305
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:40,291
but I'll treasure it all
my life, anyway. I will!

306
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:44,791
[giggles]

307
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:51,833
[YUNO]
I will repay my debt one day.

308
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:57,250
[YUNO]
Asta. We made a promise.

309
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,166
Do you remember it?

310
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:02,166
[ASTA] So, you wanna be
the Wizard King, too?

311
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,416
That means... Yuno.

312
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,666
[YUNO]
Asta.

313
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,666
[ASTA, YUNO]
You are my rival!

314
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:11,958
I actually can't believe
you remember it.

315
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:13,166
The way you've
been acting lately,

316
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,166
I was pretty sure
you'd forgotten.

317
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:20,625
Like I'd be friendly with
someone I consider my rival.

318
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:23,250
You showed me it was possible.

319
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,250
Gave me hope.

320
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:27,458
That even though
we're poor orphans,

321
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:29,250
commoners,

322
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:31,375
we can still make
something of ourselves

323
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,375
in this world.

324
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:34,833
And to prove that...

325
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:37,583
[ASTA] To make Sister Lily
and everybody else happy...

326
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:46,541
[BOTH] We'll fight to see
who will be the Wizard King,

327
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:48,333

Not yet. Not yet.

I'm nowhere near as
powerful as I need to be.

330
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:03,125
Yuno's got the lead for now.

331
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:05,000
The captain was totally right!

332
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,041
I'm just gonna
follow my own dream.

333
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:10,333
Yeah, that's it.
My arms are gonna heal.

334
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:12,458
I'll get stronger
than I've ever been,

335
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:14,416
and then I'll become
the Wizard King!

Maybe too much.

Nothing wrong with a little
gratitude if you ask me.

Yeah, come back. Okay?

I'm the strongest

353
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:01,083
in the Underwater Temple

to show off my moves.

a bunch, but they can't

358
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:13,375
go anywhere, so I'm not
really worried about it.

Man, that is a seriously
strong Binding spell

you've got there.

crossed my mind.

Just keep at it. All right?

I know your dreams
will come true someday.

There's gotta be a spell
that can heal your leg

and your throat.

366

I'll work hard, too.
And get my arms all fixed up.

As it happens, when I was down

389
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:19,791
at the Raquey Shore recently,
I put up a very fine showing

to help out my fellow
Magic Knights. Ha, ha!

391
00:23:23,708 --> 00:23:25,750

awarded me a star
