00:00:22,303 --> 00:00:23,888
[NARRATOR]
The Clover Kingdom.

2
00:00:23,972 --> 00:00:26,516
In this place where
magic is everything,

3
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:29,436
there lives a magicless
boy named Asta.

4
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,272
This brave young hero devotes
blood, sweat, and tears

5
00:00:32,355 --> 00:00:34,399
to becoming the
next Wizard King.

6
00:00:34,482 --> 00:00:37,902
Though Asta's situation
is practically unheard of,

7
00:00:37,986 --> 00:00:39,904
there are others
residing in this kingdom

8
00:00:39,988 --> 00:00:42,532
who possess at least
a tiny amount of mana,

9
00:00:42,615 --> 00:00:44,993
yet can barely
use spells at all.

10
00:00:45,076 --> 00:00:47,746
They make up a
very small minority,

11
00:00:47,829 --> 00:00:50,040
living their lives
in the shadows.

12
00:00:53,752 --> 00:00:56,546
[NARRATOR]
But, like everyone else,

13
00:00:56,629 --> 00:00:59,090
they do their best to survive.

14
00:01:10,018 --> 00:01:11,144
[MARIE]
Where am I?

15
00:01:11,227 --> 00:01:12,937
What am I doing here?

16
00:01:14,147 --> 00:01:15,607
[MARIE]
Wait, I remember!

17
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:18,026
[SECREÉ]
You're finally awake.

18
00:01:18,109 --> 00:01:19,194
[MARIE]
It's you.

19
00:01:19,277 --> 00:01:21,488
You're friends with
Asta and my brother!

20
00:01:21,571 --> 00:01:23,406
Yes.

21
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:27,869
[SECREÉ] Our magic's been sealed,
so we can't escape.

22
00:01:27,952 --> 00:01:29,871
And I borrowed a tracking
device from Asta,

23
00:01:29,954 --> 00:01:33,124
but they took that, too.

24
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:36,544
Who kidnapped us?
Do you know these people?

25
00:01:36,628 --> 00:01:38,046
[SECREÉ]
Mm-mm.

26
00:01:38,129 --> 00:01:39,964
[SECREÉ] The only thing this
girl and I have in common

27
00:01:40,048 --> 00:01:42,842
is that we were accused
of working with the devil.

28
00:01:42,926 --> 00:01:48,139
They're probably planning
to use us for leverage somehow.

29
00:01:48,223 --> 00:01:50,517
This is all for the
sake of justice.

30
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,228
Yes, indeed, Master Kabwe.

31
00:01:53,311 --> 00:01:55,397
It's our responsibility
to rid this kingdom

32
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,440
of the devil's evil servants,

33
00:01:57,524 --> 00:02:00,193
and to rebuild
what they destroyed.

34
00:02:00,276 --> 00:02:03,863
It shall be done, at all costs.

35
00:03:35,622 --> 00:03:40,877
[CROWD chattering]

36
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,754
There're so many people.

37
00:03:42,837 --> 00:03:44,297
Our kingdom deserves justice,

38
00:03:44,381 --> 00:03:46,675
and the Devil Banishers are
going to make sure we get it!

39
00:03:46,758 --> 00:03:48,551
Kill those traitors, now!

40
00:03:48,635 --> 00:03:50,470
[CROWD]
Yeah!

41
00:03:50,553 --> 00:03:52,138
--[GUY] Just get on with it!
--We want to see blood!

42
00:03:52,222 --> 00:03:55,433
I can't wait for the show!
It serves them right!

43
00:04:02,482 --> 00:04:03,942
This is insane.

44
00:04:04,025 --> 00:04:06,778
[GAUCHE] They'll all die
for disrespecting my angel!

45
00:04:06,861 --> 00:04:07,821
[ZORA]
They sure are amped up

46
00:04:07,904 --> 00:04:10,031
about watching a
couple of girls die.

47
00:04:10,115 --> 00:04:11,950
[GREY]
This is so terrifying!

48
00:04:12,033 --> 00:04:12,784
[GORDON]
Yeah.

49
00:04:12,867 --> 00:04:13,993
Hang in there, you two,

50
00:04:14,077 --> 00:04:16,788
the Black Bulls are
coming to the rescue!

51
00:04:16,871 --> 00:04:18,498
Listen up, everyone,
we got a message

52
00:04:18,581 --> 00:04:19,666
from Julius on the way.

53
00:04:19,749 --> 00:04:21,167
[gasps]

54
00:04:21,251 --> 00:04:24,212
[JULIUS] It looks like all
squads are in position.

55
00:04:24,295 --> 00:04:26,006
The execution's
scheduled for noon,

56
00:04:26,089 --> 00:04:28,550
so we've only got a little
while left to wait.

57
00:04:28,633 --> 00:04:30,969
We don't know their
numbers, but I'm sure

58
00:04:31,052 --> 00:04:35,265
they'll be using a combination
of spells and various drugs.

59
00:04:35,348 --> 00:04:37,475
Though this mission
may prove difficult,

60
00:04:37,559 --> 00:04:41,104
I'll trust you'll do everything
you can to recover the captives.

61
00:04:41,187 --> 00:04:43,440
The Silver Eagles and
the Crimson Lion Kings

62
00:04:43,523 --> 00:04:44,858
will assist with the rescue

63
00:04:44,941 --> 00:04:46,901
and make sure that none of
the civilians in the crowd

64
00:04:46,985 --> 00:04:48,862
are harmed in the process.

65
00:04:48,945 --> 00:04:51,197
The Blue Rose Knights
and Green Praying Mantises

66
00:04:51,281 --> 00:04:53,366
will patrol the
square at all times.

67
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:55,577
And, given their closeness
to the situation,

68
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,662
the Black Bulls will be
the main squad in charge

69
00:04:57,746 --> 00:04:59,289
of saving the hostages.

70
00:04:59,372 --> 00:05:00,331
Sounds good.

71
00:05:00,415 --> 00:05:01,416
One thing though.

72
00:05:01,499 --> 00:05:02,792
There's a certain
someone over here

73
00:05:02,876 --> 00:05:06,379
who's got nothin' to do
with the mission whatsoever.

74
00:05:06,463 --> 00:05:08,173
I'm guessing he tagged
along out of guilt,

75
00:05:08,256 --> 00:05:10,300
seeing as how his
subordinates are probably

76
00:05:10,383 --> 00:05:12,218
behind this whole mess.

77
00:05:12,302 --> 00:05:13,720
But I think it's
gonna be bad news

78
00:05:13,803 --> 00:05:15,972
if he decides to act on his own.

79
00:05:16,056 --> 00:05:18,433
[JULIUS]
This rescue is top-priority.

80
00:05:18,516 --> 00:05:22,228
Can we trust you'll go along
with our operation, Damnatio?

81
00:05:22,312 --> 00:05:24,230
Yes, that is my intention, sir.

82
00:05:24,314 --> 00:05:27,484
But I need to confirm
something first.

83
00:05:27,567 --> 00:05:30,820
If Asta uses the devil's power
in front of this large crowd,

84
00:05:30,904 --> 00:05:33,740
then it will only create
more anger and confusion.

85
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,741
So I'm asking--

86
00:05:34,824 --> 00:05:37,118
Of course he's not gonna do it.

87
00:05:37,202 --> 00:05:38,870
Did you think we'd
be that stupid?

88
00:05:38,953 --> 00:05:41,373
All right, squad, everyone
but Gauche and the kid,

89
00:05:41,456 --> 00:05:44,250
keep an eye on the square
like we discussed.

90
00:05:44,334 --> 00:05:47,379
These girls are two of our own,
so don't screw up!

91
00:05:47,462 --> 00:05:48,588
[BLACK BULLS]
Right!

92
00:05:48,672 --> 00:05:51,633
Good luck. Be safe.

93
00:05:51,716 --> 00:05:53,968
[MARX] The other squads are
watching over the Noble Realm,

94
00:05:54,052 --> 00:05:55,470
as you requested.

95
00:05:55,553 --> 00:05:57,013
[JULIUS]
Right.

96
00:05:57,097 --> 00:05:58,723
We have to keep in mind that
the execution could be a ruse

97
00:05:58,807 --> 00:06:01,559
to distract us while they
cause trouble elsewhere.

98
00:06:01,643 --> 00:06:04,354
[MARX] We'd better make sure
we put a stop to their plans.

99
00:06:04,437 --> 00:06:05,730
If they carry this out,

100
00:06:05,814 --> 00:06:08,733
it'll throw the kingdom
into an even greater panic.

101
00:06:08,817 --> 00:06:11,986
Yes. It's up to
the Magic Knights.

102
00:06:13,822 --> 00:06:16,199
[MIMOSA] We haven't seen
anything unusual yet.

103
00:06:16,282 --> 00:06:19,119
I hope the rescue
mission goes smoothly.

104
00:06:19,202 --> 00:06:21,663
[KLAUS] With Captain Vangeance
away protecting the border,

105
00:06:21,746 --> 00:06:24,374
we can't contribute much
to the main part of the plan,

106
00:06:24,457 --> 00:06:25,875
but let's be on alert!

107
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:26,751
[MIMOSA, YUNO]
Right.

108
00:06:26,835 --> 00:06:29,045
Ugh! Why do we have to patrol?

109
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:30,338
You're the best fighter--

110
00:06:30,422 --> 00:06:32,549
you should be right in
the middle of the action!

00:06:32,632 --> 00:06:35,051
The plan's been made,
that's that.

Man, these people have lost it!

all been drugged, too.

If you go waltzing in there,

you'll blow the lid
off this whole plan!

Okay, but we can't
just do nothing.

Right.

then you'll do as we say.

146

You make one wrong move,
and we'll kill the hostages

before they even get
out in front of the crowd.

148

[DEMON MASK 142A] Start walking
slowly toward the exit.

[VANESSA] I knew I wouldn't
sense their mana,

but I didn't expect them
to approach me like this!

It's all right.

I'm sure the others can
pull it off without me.

Understood.

00:09:01,281 --> 00:09:02,866
Now I can understand
how they were able

163
00:09:02,949 --> 00:09:05,243
to conceal their
mana so completely.

164
00:09:08,371 --> 00:09:11,458
Except that it looks like only
those three are wearing them.

165
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:14,127
[KABWE] The evidence of this
woman's guilt is obvious!

166
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:16,713
Notice the pair of
horns on her head!

167
00:09:16,796 --> 00:09:20,342
Proof that she worked with the
devil and used forbidden magic!

00:09:20,425 --> 00:09:21,801
[GUY 145C]
How disgusting!

169
00:09:21,885 --> 00:09:24,012
[GUY 145D]
That girl's evil incarnate!

170
00:09:24,095 --> 00:09:25,764
[KABWE] The child next
to her, whose brother

171
00:09:25,847 --> 00:09:29,059
is a former criminal,
is also the devil's servant!

172
00:09:29,142 --> 00:09:30,435
We have undeniable proof

that their actions have
destroyed countless lives!

174
00:09:32,562 --> 00:09:34,647
[GUY 145E] How could anyone
condemn that sweet little face?

00:09:34,731 --> 00:09:36,232
[GUY 145F]
Kill them both, now!

[LADY 145A] They should've been
put to death a long time ago!

177
00:09:39,319 --> 00:09:41,946
Lord Damnatio, if that
barrier spell explodes,

178
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:45,283
it's going to harm a
large number of civilians!

179
00:09:45,367 --> 00:09:48,745
[DAMNATIO] Kabwe. I understand
that you seek justice,

180
00:09:48,828 --> 00:09:50,330
but how can you
expect the innocent

181
00:09:50,413 --> 00:09:52,374
to pay the price for it?

182
00:09:52,457 --> 00:09:53,583
That magic.

183
00:09:53,667 --> 00:09:55,168
Since it's a barrier,
I'm guessing one of

184
00:09:55,251 --> 00:09:57,545
Scale-Boy's lackeys
is responsible.

185
00:09:57,629 --> 00:09:59,464
[KABWE]
But we mustn't forget.

186
00:09:59,547 --> 00:10:02,676
There's one boy who was
possessed by the devil himself,

187
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:05,345
and we hate him most of all!

00:10:05,428 --> 00:10:08,098
That traitor's name...

Sun is on his hands.

We know that you're
here with us, Asta.

And we want nothing more
than to see you dead!

195
00:10:22,696 --> 00:10:25,323
[MAGNA] It's just like
Captain Yami said.

[NOELLE] Even if Asta
took the blame for that,

197

they still wouldn't stop this!

198
00:10:28,493 --> 00:10:31,204
[KABWE] However, if you
come forward immediately

199
00:10:31,287 --> 00:10:33,748
and plead guilty, we will allow

[KABWE]
Why haven't you responded?

203
00:10:49,472 --> 00:10:51,516
It must mean that you
value your own life

204
00:10:51,599 --> 00:10:53,018
over those of your cohorts.

abandon his friends!

Don't worry!
We'll get out of this!

314
00:16:39,823 --> 00:16:42,409
[ONOBY cackles]
I'd like to see you try that

315
00:16:42,492 --> 00:16:44,953
without using the devil's power.

316
00:16:59,592 --> 00:17:00,677
Shall we take them away

317
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,887
before the others
arrive, Master Kabwe?

318
00:17:02,971 --> 00:17:05,140
No, I'd rather take
care of them right here.

That's not what we planned!

321
00:17:08,226 --> 00:17:10,145
The Magic Knights are powerful.

322
00:17:10,228 --> 00:17:13,064
I underestimated their strength.

323
00:17:13,148 --> 00:17:15,191
We were lucky to get this far.

324
00:17:15,275 --> 00:17:18,486
If we want to succeed, then our
safest bet is to kill them now

325
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,071
while we have the chance.

326
00:17:20,155 --> 00:17:23,158

But, sir!

[DEMON MASK 142B]
You coward!

328
00:17:24,242 --> 00:17:26,286
Why are you so scared?

329
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:28,079
Don't disrespect him!

You won't be able
to avoid these!

If you do, they'll
just hit the girl!

What's happening?

This must be them.
The Devil Banishers.

Yuno? Where'd you come from?

341
00:18:04,908 --> 00:18:07,452
[BELL giggles] Oh, we were
just in the neighborhood,

342
00:18:07,535 --> 00:18:09,120
so we figured we would drop by.

343
00:18:09,204 --> 00:18:10,580
It's no biggie!

344
00:18:10,663 --> 00:18:13,249
We were only supposed
to be patrolling,

345
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:14,793
but I believe Captain Vangeance

346
00:18:14,876 --> 00:18:17,212
would probably want
us to intervene.

347
00:18:17,295 --> 00:18:19,714
Asta! I hope you're not injured!

348
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:21,966
[ASTA]
I'm fine, just help Nero!

349
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:23,510
You'll pay for this!

350
00:18:32,435 --> 00:18:35,814
If they hadn't showed up,
we would've had Asta for sure!

351
00:18:35,897 --> 00:18:38,233
We need to retreat
before they catch us!

352
00:18:45,407 --> 00:18:46,783
[ASTA]
Give Nero back!

353
00:18:46,866 --> 00:18:47,951
That's not going to happen.

354
00:18:48,034 --> 00:18:51,496
Now stand down,
or we'll slit her throat!

355
00:18:51,579 --> 00:18:53,623
Really, they're running away?

356
00:18:53,707 --> 00:18:55,458
Unbelievable.

357
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:05,427
They say that a devil dwells
in the five-leaf grimoire,

358
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,721
so we'll be taking
it off your hands.

No, wait!

--They're gone.
--[KLAUS, MIMOSA] Asta!

Make sure Marie's okay, Mimosa.

363
00:19:21,735 --> 00:19:22,861
Sure!

364
00:19:24,404 --> 00:19:26,448
[KLAUS]
So, they took your grimoire.

365
00:19:26,531 --> 00:19:28,992
They really thought
of everything.

366
00:19:29,075 --> 00:19:30,368
[YUNO]
Not everything.

367
00:19:30,452 --> 00:19:33,204
Asta's magic doesn't
come from his grimoire.

368
00:19:33,288 --> 00:19:34,914
What do you mean?

369
00:19:34,998 --> 00:19:40,128
[KLAUS]
I don't follow.

370
00:19:40,211 --> 00:19:41,629
That's right.

371
00:19:53,099 --> 00:19:56,394
I'll get Nero back,
and my grimoire.

372
00:19:56,478 --> 00:19:59,689
Because my magic
is never giving up!

[GAUCHE]
Marie!

00:20:15,372 --> 00:20:16,956
Please don't die!

I need my angel with me forever!

Don't leave me behind.
I can't bear it!

00:20:23,797 --> 00:20:25,340
She's just sleeping.

378
00:20:25,423 --> 00:20:28,593
Owen says she needs rest,
but she'll wake up later on.

379
00:20:28,677 --> 00:20:30,595
[GAUCHE]
So, she's gonna be okay?

380
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:33,181
Yes.

381
00:20:33,264 --> 00:20:36,351
[GAUCHE]
Good.

382
00:20:36,434 --> 00:20:39,229
I guess this means
that I owe you again.

383
00:20:42,524 --> 00:20:44,317
[DAMNATIO] Today we discovered
that my subordinates

384
00:20:44,401 --> 00:20:47,028
were indeed responsible
for the kidnappings.

385
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:50,323
Please allow me to apologize
for my oversight.

386

You said they had a
strong sense of justice,

387
00:20:53,034 --> 00:20:54,619
but taking a whole
crowd prisoner

388
00:20:54,703 --> 00:20:57,205
doesn't exactly scream
"do-gooders" to me.

389
00:20:57,288 --> 00:20:59,874
I wonder if the Devil Banishers
are being manipulated

390
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,835
by a completely
different entity.

391
00:21:01,918 --> 00:21:04,212
You're right, they did
take Asta's grimoire.

392
00:21:04,295 --> 00:21:05,505
Someone other than Kabwe

393
00:21:05,588 --> 00:21:08,008
could've wanted it
for their own purposes.

394
00:21:08,091 --> 00:21:08,883
[YAMI]
Hey, wait.

395
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:10,093
You're throwing ideas out there,

396
00:21:10,176 --> 00:21:12,887
and you weren't even
at the first meeting.

397
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:14,347
After you cried like a baby

398
00:21:14,431 --> 00:21:17,600
and made a big thing out of
proving your loyalty, too!

399
00:21:17,684 --> 00:21:19,185
To clarify:

400
00:21:19,269 --> 00:21:22,272
I was the one who asked him to
go keep an eye on the borders.

401
00:21:22,355 --> 00:21:24,983
If the Spade Kingdom were
to make a move right now,

402
00:21:25,066 --> 00:21:26,735
there'd be chaos.

403
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:29,904
Everyone, there's something
that I need to show you.

404
00:21:31,364 --> 00:21:32,699
[MARX]
We investigated the memories

405
00:21:32,782 --> 00:21:35,577
of the Devil Banishers
we took into custody.

406
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,078
Apparently, their organization

407
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:38,663
is largely made up
of paid hires.

a message from Kabwe!

Kabwe?

413
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:54,304
We're listening. Where are you?

414
00:21:54,387 --> 00:22:00,393
[KABWE groaning]
It's a lie.

415
00:22:00,477 --> 00:22:03,313
These people aren't trying to
bring about the devil's demise.

416
00:22:03,396 --> 00:22:06,524
Not at all.

417
00:22:06,608 --> 00:22:09,027
The truth is that...

418
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:12,405
...they're after
the devil's power!

419
00:22:12,489 --> 00:22:14,532
What do you mean?

420
00:22:14,616 --> 00:22:19,245
[KABWE] This organization
actually worships the devil.

421
00:22:19,329 --> 00:22:22,457
They're called Devil Believers!

[GAUCHE] Ah, thank goodness
my angel's back safe!

00:23:59,387 --> 00:24:01,723
But this isn't over yet.

"Those Who Worship the Devil."

the crap out of those freaks!
