1
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:15,625
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:18,666
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:24,416
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,208
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:35,458
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:39,708
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:18,291
[SALIM] I take it these are
Hage's famous pop-potatoes?

8
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:20,791
I'm not sure they'll be
up to your noble tastes, sir,

9
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:23,041
but we hope you will at
least find them adequate.

10
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:25,083
[SALIM sniffs]

11
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:31,166
Incredibly crumbly and mealy.

12
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,833
And I'm not certain
I've ever had something

13
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:34,833
that dries the mouth so.

14
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:38,291
[SALIM]
And yet it's...

15
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:39,166
[BOTH gasp]

16
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,416
...tasty.

17
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,583
[HIGH PRIEST]
Good! I'm so glad to hear it.

18
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:45,750
Sister Lily, it
seems you possess

19
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:48,250
an exemplary talent for cooking.

20
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:50,166
I only prepared
a few basic dishes.

21
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,833
There's more than
enough for everyone.

22
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:54,041
Don't hesitate to eat
as much as you'd like.

23
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:56,416
And the same goes for you
two as well, of course.

24
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,166
[KLAUS]
Yes, thank you.

25
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:01,666
[KLAUS]
A noble of the Clover Kingdom,

26
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,000
in a ramshackle church,

27
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:05,708
eating dishes that
defy identification.

28
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:06,708
Oh, wow.

29
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,708
It truly does dry
one's mouth out.

30
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:12,125
Yes, quite extraordinary,
isn't it? Our good boys

31
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:14,041
Yuno and Asta both
sent home money

32
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:16,750
from the first wages they
received as Magic Knights.

33
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:18,166
Thanks to them,

34
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,875
we were able to buy a huge
supply of pop-potatoes.

35
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:23,083
Enough to make sure all the
children here at the church

36
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:25,833
will have full
bellies every day!

37
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,625
Here's an idea: maybe next time

38
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,541
buy us something
different for once.

39
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,375
There's no need
to be greedy, Nash.

40
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:35,500
Just look how big and
strong Yuno here got

41
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:38,125
on a steady diet
of pop-potatoes.

42
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:39,666
[SALIM]
Yuno.

43
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,791
Sending the first of
your wages back home--

44
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:43,791
that was very honorable.

45
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,125
It's nothing.

46
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:48,208
[LILY] That's not true.
We're very grateful, Yuno.

47
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:50,708
The money that you sent
helped us out so much,

48
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,625
and not just with pop-potatoes.

49
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:55,125
We were finally able to patch up
all the holes in the floor.

50
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:57,166
And we dug a well
out in the garden, too.

51
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,791
Thank you for everything, Yuno!

52
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,875
Yeah, for everything!

53
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:05,708
Asta sent something, too?

54
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:09,666
Yes, and what
a contribution it was!

55
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:14,583
How much did he send?

56
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:18,250
Oh, um. He, uh...

57
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:20,541
[LILY whispers]

58
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:21,875
[gasps]

59
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:26,166
[laughing] Beat you, Yuno!

60
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,083
When I get my wages next month,

61
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,208
I'm sending it all to you.

62
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:33,208
What? That really
isn't necessary.

63
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:35,250
The amount you already
sent was so generous,

64
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,291
we'll be more than
fine for a while.

65
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:38,916
But thank you for offering.

66
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,666
You'll get it all.

67
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:44,958
Um, well, sure.
If that's what you want.

68
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:46,208
[KLAUS clears throat]

69
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:47,500
Pardon, Salim, sir.

70
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:49,541
We really ought to be
on our way now.

71
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:50,958
Why, what's the hurry?

72
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:54,083
We can stay a little longer,
surely. Just think.

73
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:55,583
As members of the nobility,

74
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:59,291
we have a rare opportunity
to broaden our horizons here.

75
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:00,708
Please, Sister Lily.

76
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:03,333
Might I trouble you for
another glass of water?

77
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:04,708
Of course!

78
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:09,041
[LILY]
Oh, looks like it's empty.

79
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:10,833
Well. I'll go.

80
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:12,166
[YUNO]
Let me.

81
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:16,458
No, it's all right.
You just stay put and relax.

82
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:19,375
[SALIM]
Wait. Please. Just a moment.

83
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:24,958
It still gets rather
chilly out at night.

84
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:28,125
Thank you very much.

85
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:32,541
A real gentleman, arent'cha?

00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:33,791
Yes, well, you know.

00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,250
These things just
come naturally to me.

88
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:39,083
That's what it means
to be a true nobleman.

What happened?

[HIGH PRIEST]
What was that crash?

96
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:03,333
[NASH]
Where's Sister Lily?

97
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:10,791
[YUNO]
I recognize that.

98
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,958
The villains who
came after Salim before

99
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:14,291
were wearing these brooches.

100
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,666
Those bandits who
attacked us earlier?

101
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,166
I can't believe it.

102
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,708
I gave her my robe so she
wouldn't catch cold out here,

103
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:23,125
but because she was wearing it,
they took Sister Lily,

104
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:25,958
mistaking her for me.

105
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:27,875
Oh... It makes sense.

106
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:29,833
That must be what happened.

[ARLU]
Is Sister Lily going to be okay?

108

Is she? Yuno?

Yes, don't worry.
I'll bring her back.

Yeah, so am I.

00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,916
Count me in!

[YUNO]
No.

116
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,875
Everyone else stays here.

117
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:55,208
I can handle this on my own.

118
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,458
Hold on.

119
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:01,916
Remember our mission:
to protect Salim.

We don't know when they'll
come for him again.

121
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,083
We must depart at once.

122
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:08,833
You can't really mean that.

123
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:10,583
What about Sister?

124
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:12,166
Yeah, come on, four-eyes!

00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,166
Um, four-eyes--

00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,583
I mean, Klaus.

00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:19,083
Can't we...?

129
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:22,208
That's quite enough,
Mimosa. Now.

130
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:24,083
I know you're worried
about your friend,

but you will just
have to leave it

for the local watch to handle.

isn't the same as bravery, Yuno?

So don't worry.

This might hurt just
a little bit, though. Sorry.

157
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:48,708
I see what's going on here.

158

It's me you've been after
this whole time. Not Salim.

Heh. You really are
a clever boy, aren't ya?

Ha!

[BABRA cackles] Now I'll sit
back and watch you drown!

[YUNO] I don't know what
you're talking about.

I can breathe here just fine.

164
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:10,791
[BABRA]
What the--?

165
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:16,916
[YUNO] You wanna know
how to drown someone?

166
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,416
Let me show you!

167
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,875
[BABRA screams]

168
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:30,958
That's two down.

169
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,500
[CABRA] I can't believe you fell
for our false trail so easily!

170
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:55,291
Hah! How do ya like that?

171
00:09:57,875 --> 00:10:00,625
Not bad. Let's see.

172
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,791
[CABRA]
How 'bout this?

173
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,666
[CABRA]
Ha, ha!

174
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:13,791
Impossible!

175
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:17,125
What is it about
people like you?

176
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:19,666
You always seem to think
that bigger is better.

177
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,125
[CABRA]
Uh-- Fine! I'll just--

178
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:22,708
[YUNO]
Too late.

179
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,458
[gasps, yelps]

180
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:29,458
[YUNO]
Three down. Just two to go.

181
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:30,666
[gasps]

182
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,541
That's Sister Lily!

183
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:47,666
[ABRA]
Ah! Stop right there.

184
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,375
That's a good boy.

185
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:51,208
You wouldn't wanna
do anything stupid

186
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:54,916
and get the Sister's pretty
face burned now, would you?

187
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,791
[ABRA laughs]

188
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,166
[LILY]
Yuno.

189
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,333
Even as young as you are,

190
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:20,750
you seem to have a
real talent for magic.

191
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,375
If you ever see
someone in trouble,

192
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:25,166
please help them instead
of looking the other way.

193
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,250
Promise me. You, too, Asta.

194
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:31,458
What, Sister Lily?
Did you say something?

195
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:38,375
[ABRA]
Now then, down to business.

196
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:41,208
Hand over that grimoire
of yours, Yuno.

197
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:45,666
Without it, you should
be suitably helpless.

198
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,500
What would you do
with my grimoire?

199
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,250
Sell it, perhaps.

200
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,708
Maybe I'll decide
to burn it, instead.

201
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:54,583
I'm not especially concerned
about what becomes of it.

202
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:55,833
If you don't have your grimoire,

203
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:57,541
the Magic Knights
won't see any reason

204
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:59,875
to keep you around.

205
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:01,916
[YUNO]
Is that what you're after?

206
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:05,666
And if I won't give it up?

207
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,500
[ABRA]
You're refusing?

208
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:15,791
That's what I thought.
Hand it over.

209
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:19,666
Then you can take your precious
sister and be on your way.

210
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,500
Not happening.

211
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:25,208
What? Don't you
understand? She'll be--

212
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:27,291
[YUNO] I'm not going
to let you hurt her.

213
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:29,750
You think attacking me
is going to do any good?

214
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,166
If you wanna give
it a shot, okay. Sure.

215
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,416
[YUNO]
I won't be the one attacking.

216
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,166
Who--?

217
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,333
Right. Steel Creation Magic:

218
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:40,083
Spiral Lance!

219
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:43,166
[yelps]

220
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:45,541
[ABRA groans]

221
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:49,125
[KLAUS]
Mimosa.

222
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:50,166
[MIMOSA]
Right!

223
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,208
[MIMOSA]
She'll be okay.

224
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:56,291
[sighs]

225
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,208
Are any of the bandits
unaccounted for?

226
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:00,708
By my count, there should
be one more of them.

227
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:03,458
Ran away then. Heh.

228
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:09,625
What were you planning on doing
if I hadn't been there to help?

229
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:11,625
Why <i>are</i> you here?

230
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:12,708
Honestly, Yuno,

231
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:16,166
do you take me for
some kind of fool?

232
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,916
[KLAUS]
He does, the brat.

233
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,458
[clears throat]

234
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:20,791
Now listen closely.

235
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:23,291
As Magic Knights,
we have a solemn duty:

236
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,458
to safeguard the people.

237
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:30,000
I already suspected
something was off.

238
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:33,333
[KLAUS]
This bunch wasn't out for Salim.

239
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:35,083
They were after you.

240
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:37,708
[KLAUS]
You imagine a noble

241
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,500
would want to
visit this village?

242
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:42,875
That he'd eat pop-potatoes,
and without complaint?

243
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:47,958
[KLAUS]
I'm sorry, but I don't think so.

244
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:49,416
And they didn't
abduct the sister

245
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,041
thinking she was Salim. Rubbish.

246
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,125
I found it strange that
Salim would want you

247
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:57,708
as his bodyguard
after losing to you.

248
00:13:57,791 --> 00:13:59,958
After you left to
rescue Sister Lily,

249
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:01,541
I used a spell on Salim:

250
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:05,583
my Plant Creation Magic:
Flower of Truth.

251
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:07,750
[SALIM] It's Yuno's fault
that I didn't get to join

252
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,083
the Magic Knights!

253
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:11,291
Him and that four-leaf
clover grimoire.

254
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:14,833
Damn book. I'm going
to take it from him!

255
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:16,625
He'll know what real
pain is by the time

256
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,208
Daddy gets through with him!

257
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,916
I will have my revenge!

258
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,500
[KLAUS]
He gave up everything easily.

259
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:26,208
[YUNO] But once you
decided to come find me,

260
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,041
how'd you know where to look?

261
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:31,125
That was Mimosa's
doing, as well.

262
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:32,958
[MIMOSA]

Let's see...

265
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:40,333
Oh, yes. There they are.

266
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:44,416
[KLAUS] And that's how we were
able to arrive just in time

267
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,291
to provide backup.

268
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:50,833
I'm very glad you came.
I needed the help.

269
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:53,708
Thank you, Klaus, Mimosa.

270
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:54,875
[KLAUS]
Hmph.

271
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:56,333
It's nothing.

272
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:58,166
[SALIM mufflied grunting]

273
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,791
Quiet!

274
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:00,875
Honestly.

275
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:03,000
Blaming others for
your own failure?

276
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:06,458
Obviously you'd be the loser
in a match against Yuno.

277
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:10,000
He earned the approval
of all the squad captains,

278
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:12,625
chief among them
Captain William Vangeance,

leader of the great Golden Dawn.

00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,750
That should tell you
how talented he is.

281
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,625
Thank you, sir.

282
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:23,416
Yes, well.

00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,166
Don't misunderstand me.

284
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,416
You still have a ways to go
before earning my approval.

[MIMOSA giggles]

286
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,125
Right.

287
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:32,375
Now, then.

288
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,958
I'll overlook your
insubordination this time.

289
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:36,833
It was all this cowardly
little idiot's doing

290
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:38,875
in the first place.

291
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:41,208
What next? Your choice.

00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,125
Shall we bring them

[SALIM grunts]

No. I don't think that
will be necessary.

00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:51,333
Are you certain?

00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:52,375
[YUNO]
As long as they never

come near Hage Village again.

You stupid commoner.

Making you lose
your guard like this

was all part of the plan!

recruiting her into

We will be taking them in.

00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:04,708
things were getting dicey,

325
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:07,583
but they handled it
just fine without me.

326
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,333
William's new recruits
are certainly

327
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,708
nothing to be ashamed of.

328
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:13,000
[JULIUS]
Not at all.

329
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:15,625
How long were you
planning to laze about?

330
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:17,125
Do you know how
loud you are?

331
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:19,041
You need to return immediately!

332
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,583
There is a mountain
of work to be done.

333
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,708
[JULIUS]
All right, all right.

334
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:25,458
At this rate, you're gonna
give yourself an ulcer.

335
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:28,083
[MARX] And whose fault
do you think that is?!

336
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,333
[HIGH PRIEST]
You're really back!

337
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:33,416
I'm so glad that you're okay!

338
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,541
So glad!

339
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:35,583
So glad!

340
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:37,291
I guess we shouldn't
be surprised.

341
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:39,541
Not with Magic Knights
on the case.

342
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:42,166
Thank you all. Mimosa, Klaus.

343
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,791
I'm lucky you two
were there as well.

344
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,500
Think nothing of it.

345
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:49,458
We have the culprit.
That cowardly fool.

346
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:51,583
Honestly, what was he thinking?

347
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,708
Oh, right! Please
help yourselves.

348
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:56,500
The least we can do is
feed you before you go.

349
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:58,000
They may be a bit cold,

350
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,375
but you can have
as much as you'd like.

351
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:18,583
The flavor's not so bad, really.

352
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:22,000
I thought Magic Knights
weren't supposed to lie, sir.

353
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:22,958
[KLAUS]
Hmph.

354
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:24,791
[REKKA chuckles]

355
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:29,833
Perfect.

[ALL laughing]

357
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:41,416
[KLAUS]
A star?

358
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,916
[WILLIAM] The Wizard King
has evaluated your deeds,

359
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,250
and he has seen fit
to grant you a star.

360
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,125
[KLAUS]
Thank you, Captain.

361
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:49,791
We're honored to receive it.

362
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:50,958
Oh, wow!

363
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:52,583
How many people can
say they got a star

364
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:54,416
on their very first mission?

365
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,875
Although,

366
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:59,041
I don't recall doing
anything that extraordinary.

367
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:00,708
[WILLIAM]
On the contrary,

368
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:03,625
Salim's testimony
was quite valuable.

369
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:06,083
Thanks to that, Congressman
Hapshass's wrongdoings

370
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:07,833
have all come to light.

371
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:11,000
Bribery, fraudulent
accounting, shadowy deals.

372
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,708
Everyone involved
has been rounded up.

373
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:16,208
And you get all the credit.

374
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:17,375
I wonder, sir.

375
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:18,500
Did you accept this mission

376
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:22,000
having anticipated
such an outcome?

377
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:23,833
Evil deeds must
not go unpunished

378
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:27,375
in the Clover Kingdom.
It is our duty to see to that.

379
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,166
[KLAUS]
Yes, sir!

380
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:32,625
[WILLIAM]
Klaus, Yuno, Mimosa.

381
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:33,708
I look forward to seeing

382
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:36,791
what you will accomplish
in the future.

383
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,958
[YUNO, MIMOSA, KLAUS]
Sir!

384
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:40,958
[KLAUS]
Yuno and Mimosa.

385
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:46,583
As far as new recruits go, well,
they seem capable, I suppose.

386
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:53,625
I expect a great deal.

387
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:58,458
Oh, yes. Especially
from you, Yuno.

388

[KLAUS]
A star.

390
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:05,541
Things turned out
quite well in the end.

391
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:10,666
But, Yuno, don't ever
go off on your own again.

392
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,041
Right.

393
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:13,541
Why did you pause?

394
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:15,125
Come on, Yuno, look at me.

395
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:16,916
I want you to look me
in the eye now

396
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,041
and promise me that
you won't do it again.

397
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:19,958
[YUNO]
Sure.

Take us to your leader, humans.

Just when we finally got down
to 100-star difference, too.

404
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:38,875
Well, it looks like
we're back up to 101 now.

up to them, too.

Yeah, we were close.

No, sir. Not even
slightly close.

at negative 30.

the lead for long!

give this mission to.

It's almost as awesome
as the Crazy Cyclone.
