1
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:15,666
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,833
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:24,666
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,583
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,750
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:40,583
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:43,916
[NARRATOR]
The cornered Asta found himself

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,583
at a complete loss against
the overwhelming power

9
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:49,958
of the leader of the
Eye of the Midnight Sun.

10
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:52,333
However, he was saved
at the last moment

11
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:56,083
by Yami Sukehiro, the captain
of the Black Bulls.

12
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:59,833
Theirs was a breathless battle
of Light versus Dark Magic.

13
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:04,666
Asta pushed past his limits
to launch a counterattack.

14
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:05,791
But then...

15
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:09,583
[LICHT]
You hurt him. How dare you?

16
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:12,125
I will not allow humans
like you to continue

17
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:14,208
harming my compatriots.

18
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:16,750
You've done too
much damage already.

19
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:21,666
Light Creation Magic:
Light Whip of Judgment!

20
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,625
[LICHT laughs]

21
00:01:24,708 --> 00:01:27,083
Your struggles are pointless!

22
00:01:29,291 --> 00:01:30,583
It's crumbling!

23
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:34,916
[laughs] That nutball's not
holding anything back!

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,375
[screams]

25
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:45,333
Goodness.

26
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:47,958
And here I was attempting
to restrain myself.

27
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:50,791
Poor fools. You truly are weak.

28
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:53,666
Your kingdom as well.
It, too, will fall.

29
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,458
You destroyed them, Master.

30
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:58,625
Surely only a god could
wield such power.

31
00:01:58,708 --> 00:02:00,875
If you wished it,
all of the Clover Kingdom's

32
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:03,333
Magic Knights would
cower before you!

33
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:05,291
[ASTA, YAMI yells]

34
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,625
They live?

35
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:44,250
[YAMI laughs]
Keep up that kinda focus,

36
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:47,708
and you'll even start
sensing ki out in nature.

37
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:49,333
We won't have to worry
about any falling rocks

38
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:50,833
hittin' you on the head, eh?

39
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:53,333
Awesome!

40
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:55,583
Heck, yeah! I love ki!

41
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:57,833
We'll teach this arrogant fool.

42
00:03:57,916 --> 00:03:59,500
Here we go!

43
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:02,125
Time to kick it up a notch and
take out the white-haired guy

44
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,458
with the weird dots on his face.

45
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:05,208
[yelps]

46
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,916
Actually, right now I feel
like I could take him!

47
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,458
Aw, yeah!

48
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:12,000
With the power of ki on my side,
there's nothin' I can't do!

49
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:14,583
All right, Dottyface,
you ready to get beat?

50
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:15,500
[laughs]

51
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:17,083
Whoa, easy there, kid.

52
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:18,625
Huh?

53
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,250
[YAMI]
That guy is mine.

54
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,500
You wanna see what
I can really do, right?

55
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,000
Plus, he'd just kill you.

56
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:25,416
Aw, come on, that's not fair!

57
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,875
I got all pumped up
and ready to fight

58
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:28,416
the scary boss guy
and everything!

59
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,083
[YAMI]
Don't care.

60
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:33,916
You take Skinnybones Lineface
over there all right?

61
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,333
[YAMI]
Okay. This is gonna be fun.

62
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:40,916
Been a while since
I've had a real fight.

63
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:26,666
[YAMI yelling]

64
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,875
[YAMI grunts]

65
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:39,958
Dark Magic: Dark Cloaked.
Lightless Slash!

66
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:44,291
[LICHT] I thought as much.
My magic is being drawn in.

67
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:48,208
[LICHT]
Such is the power of Dark Magic.

68
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:49,458
No matter.

69
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:51,375
Now that you've revealed
what you're capable of,

70
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:54,250
I should be able to evade
capture easily enough.

71
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:55,750
[YAMI]
Mm-hm, listen.

72
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:58,500
You were tellin' us some weird
little fairy tale earlier.

73
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:01,208
But that wasn't the
end of it, was it?

74
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:02,583
If you're carryin'
around a grimoire

75
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:05,458
with a clover on it,
you must be from around here.

76
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,625
Why attack your homeland?

77
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:30,333
[LICHT chuckles]
You're wide open.

78
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:34,500
[LICHT]
Was that his plan?

79
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:36,958
Leaving an opening
to make me careless?

80
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:41,333
Yami Sukehiro. You are
formidable indeed.

81
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,500
Okay, cut the crap
now and tell me

82
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:53,000
what you're really after.

83
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:54,708
There must be some
things that you see

84
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:56,625
more clearly than other people,

85
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,791
having come here
from another land.

86
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:02,208
The twisted ways
of this kingdom.

87
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,833
Some here are on the verge
of starving to death.

88
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:08,375
While others discard
food they cannot finish.

89
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:10,708
Citizens' ranks are
supposedly determined

90
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:12,958
by their power,
and yet some are met

91
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:15,625
with discrimination despite
the strength of their magic

92
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:17,666
because of their low birth.

93
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,916
Others are persecuted
for the simple crime

94
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,833
of having been born
in a different land.

95
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,750
These disparities that
taint the kingdom

96
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:27,833
are the reason we exist.

97
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:30,708
We were born in order
to see them rectified.

98
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:33,125
Yeah, you got me
a little confused now.

99
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:34,916
Seems like you people
are just basically doin'

100
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,708
the same thing, goin'
around hurtin' people

101
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:38,750
who don't deserve it.

102
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,000
And, well, that's kinda dumb.

103
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:43,416
No, it makes perfect sense.

104
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,250
We merely respond
to your sins in kind.

105
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,916
Yeah, I get it. You just
wanna do things your way,

106
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
and I sorta like that attitude.

107
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,625
But...

108
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:56,291
...you really annoy
the hell outta me!

109
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,333
[ASTA]
This fight is unreal.

110
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:32,833
[ASTA]
So that's what it looks like

111
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:35,041
when the captain
doesn't hold back.

112
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:39,958
[ASTA] I train so hard,
but without magic,

113
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:41,833
can I ever surpass them?

114
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:46,458
Captain Yami. Yuno.
The Wizard King.

115
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:52,625
[VALTOS] He's strong
enough to hold his own

116
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:56,375
against Master Licht?
Incredible.

117
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:59,333
[VALTOS] Master, please!
Allow me to assist.

118
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:04,958
Look alive, kid.

119
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:07,041
[ASTA]
He almost squished me!

120
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:10,250
Why're you just standin' there
like some kinda chicken?

121
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,875
I put you in charge of
Skinnypants, didn't I?

122
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:16,333
I wouldn't give you more
than you could handle.

123
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:19,625
Do something. Fight
him your way, kid.

124
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,666
Right!

125
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,000
[ASTA]
Yes.

126
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:30,416
Whatever it takes, I will
become the Wizard King.

127
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,041
I can't waste time
being bummed out.

128
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:35,500
Eventually, I'm gonna
be the Wizard King.

129
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:36,916
But first,

130
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,708
I'm gonna be the
guy who beats you!

131
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:41,458
That's where you're wrong, boy.

132
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:43,250
Let's see how you
handle this spell.

133
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,958
Spatial Magic: Myriad Black.

134
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:48,250
You may have anticipated
a single attack,

135
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,958
but do you think you
can block all of these?

136
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:56,416
[ASTA yells]

137
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:06,625
[ASTA]
One of them got past my guard.

138
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:09,041
I can keep this up
as long as I want.

139
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:12,791
Until you're too weak
to stand, much less fight.

140
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:18,958
[ASTA yells]

141
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,166
[VALTOS]
You sin in defying Master Licht,

142
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,375
even magicless as you are.

143
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,166
And you shall atone
with your life.

144
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:31,500
[yelps]

145
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:33,083
[ASTA]
Not good.

146
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:37,166
There's no way I can keep this
up until he runs out of magic.

147
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,333
If I don't do something,
I'm as good as dead,

148
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,416
even if I counter his attacks.

149
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:46,125
Think. Stay calm. Do it my way.

150
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,875
You're tossing aside
your only weapons?

151
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:54,125
Have you lost your mind?

152
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:55,625
Very well, as you wish.

153
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:58,666
I'll bury you with
one final blow.

154
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:13,041
[ASTA yells]

155
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:17,041
[VALTOS gasps]
He dove into the portal?

156
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:21,041
[yells]

157
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:22,708
[groans]

158
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,666
[ASTA grunts]

159
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:33,541
[laughs] That's your way?
Punchin' the guy?

160
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:36,625
You're a funny one,
you know that, right?

161
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:39,041
Your guard's down.

162
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:41,041
[YAMI]
You sure about that?

163
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:44,500
[LICHT]
It absorbed my attack.

164
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:49,208
[LICHT]
And... I can't move.

165
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:52,250
[YAMI]
From Dark Magic: Black Hole

166
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:55,708
to Dark Magic: Dark Cloaked.

167
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:58,500
Black Blade.

168
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:17,250
Captain Yami, sir!

169
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:19,166
[laughs]

170
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,625
You fell down!

171
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,541
That's quite a spell.

172
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:25,416
Its range appears to be
limited to about five meters,

173
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,500
but even so, a magic that can
not only absorb my spells

174
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:32,625
but also halt my movements.

175
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:35,333
Dark Magic. Incredible.

176
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:38,208
Such a powerful
attribute to have.

177
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:42,000
And the only one in
direct opposition to mine.

178
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:45,500
However, Dark Magic
is extremely slow.

179
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:47,041
Here, too, it stands opposed

180
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:50,125
to Light Magic's
extraordinary speed.

181
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:53,000
To make up for that,
you improvised by cloaking

182
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:55,291
your weapon in Darkness
and patching the gaps

183
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,666
with Reinforcement Magic.

184
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:03,916
Spot on, pal.

185
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,583
[ASTA]
That's all you're gonna say?!

186
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,500
[YAMI] What are you
waiting for, anyway?

187
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,875
You can use Recovery
Magic, can't you?

188
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,916
Get recovering, already.

189
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,250
Of course, when you do,
I'm just gonna

190
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,375
jam this baby into
your chest area.

191
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:17,791
So I guess maybe it's
not worth the trouble.

192
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:20,708
I will admit,
you are indeed strong.

193
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:23,875
Only the second I've faced
with the power to defeat me.

194
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:26,500
But I'm afraid I have no
more time to waste here

195
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,375
trifling with you.

196
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,541
Hold on, back up real quick.

197
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:32,416
What do you mean,
I'm the second one?

198
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,166
There was someone before you.

199
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,458
The man who wounded
my hand so badly

200
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:37,875
that it will never recover,

201
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:41,750
The Wizard King Julius
Novochrono--my greatest foe--

202
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:44,083
still remains.

203
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:48,833
[LICHT] This shall be my most
powerful spell so far.

204
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:50,958
Too swift for you to evade.

205
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:52,458
Too powerful and extensive

206
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,375
for your magic to
draw in as before.

207
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:58,375
There's no escaping fate.
This will be your undoing.

208
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:00,583
The moment that I cast
it will be your last

209
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:04,458
in this world, Captain
of the Black Bulls.

210
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:06,625
Whatever. Not a chance!

211
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:08,833
Don't underestimate
Captain Yami!

212
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:10,875
You think you're
somethin' special?

213
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:12,958
Nah. This could go pretty bad.

214
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:14,583
He's got some nasty magic.

215
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,750
[ASTA]
What?

216
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,333
[LICHT]
You, too, young man.

217
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:21,666
You must be punished for the
harm you've done to Valtos.

218
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,583
I'll be taking back
that grimoire.

219
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,541
[YAMI] Anyone with a four-leaf
clover is gonna have

220
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:28,583
some seriously strong magic.

221
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,208
And unless I surprise
him somehow,

222
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:32,250
he can dodge all my attacks.

223
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:35,250
So, what to do.

224
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:39,875
[YAMI]
That's future Yami's problem.

225
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,666
[BOY 33A]
Daddy!

226
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,041
[BOY 35A]
Mommy!

227
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:45,583
[BOY 33A]
I was so scared!

228
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:46,958
[MOTHER 35A]
I know, dear.

229
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:48,833
[FATHER 35A]
Are you hurt?

230
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:53,125
[sighs] Looks like we got
all of them out safe.

231
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:54,458
[GAUCHE]
Hey, old hag!

232
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:56,250
No dying on me!

233
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,291
Wake up, you decrepit crone!

234
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:00,708
You're an immortal
demon-witch, remember?

235
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:02,416
[MARIE, LUCA, MARCO]
Sister!

236
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:07,000
[MARCO]
No. What happened to her?

237
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:10,583
Please, Gauche.

238
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:12,583
I know you're worried about her,
but you're badly hurt, too.

239
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:14,750
Try to stay calm until your
own injuries have been--

240
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:17,291
Shut your mouth!

241
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:20,083
[FINRAL]
But I'm your superior!

242
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,166
Sir. It isn't as
bad as it looks.

243
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,666
He's almost completely healed.

244
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,833
Huh?

245
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:28,958
It's strange, but somehow
all the injuries

246
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:31,000
he sustained seem
to be located just shy

247
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:32,500
of where they'd be fatal.

248
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:34,583
Wow, it sounds like
he got really lucky.

249
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,583
[MAGE 35A]
Or maybe more than that.

250
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:40,041
You need to forget about me
and just heal the old hag!

251
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,500
[MAGE 35A]
Yes, sir!

252
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:44,041
Listen to me! You open your
eyes right now! Got that?

253
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:46,291
[SISTER THERESA]
Will you shut up?

254
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:47,458
[GAUCHE gasps]

255
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:51,250
I can hear fine, you fool.
No need to yell.

256
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:52,750
Old hag!

257
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:54,375
[ALL]
Sister!

258
00:15:57,416 --> 00:16:00,666
[SISTER THERESA]
Take my magic power with you.

259
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,958
You might need it.

260
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:03,125
[GAUCHE gasps]

261
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:06,125
You're going to
help them, right?

262
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:09,125
Asta and the other one.

263
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:11,875
But I... I could never.

264
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:14,958
I'm so glad you
met that young man.

265
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:18,333
It changed you, somehow.

266
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:21,125
I'm counting on you, Gauche.

267
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:24,208
[GAUCHE]
Old hag...

268
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:28,166
[KIDS whimper]

269
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:32,458
You can't be gone.

270
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,750
You're too tough to die.

271
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:35,916
Bring her back right now!

272
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,666
But, sir--

273
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:37,916
Just do something!

274
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,083
Please, listen.

275
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:41,083
Do you wanna see Marie cry?

276
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,583
But she's alive.

277
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,125
Huh?

278
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,708
[MAGE 35A]
She isn't dead.

279
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:49,000
Stupid cow!

280
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:51,250
You can't go around
scaring people like that!

281
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:52,750
How many times
have you called me

282
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:54,708
an immortal demon-witch?

283
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:59,166
I'm not going to die.
Not easily, at least.

284
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,375
Stop worrying about me.

285
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:03,541
Just go help them.

286
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:07,333
Please, I want you
to take my magic, too!

287
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:08,458
And mine, mister!

288
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:09,666
Yeah, mine, too!

289
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:12,416
You gotta help Asta
beat those mean guys!

290
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:16,125
[NEIGE] Please, will you
use my magic, as well?

291
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:17,625
You, too?

292
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:20,125
Your sister was frightened
and hurt because of me,

293
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:22,916
and I can't tell you
how sorry I am.

294
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:33,166
If I came with you,
I would only get in the way,

295
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:36,791
but please go,
and tell Asta good luck.

296
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:38,291
[MARIE]
Big brother?

297
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:42,500
See? It's like I said.

298
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:45,375
People survive by
supporting each other.

299
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:47,125
Marie.

300
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,000
[YAMI]
I won't stop you.

301
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:52,833
Protect whatever you
think needs protecting.

302
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:56,541
Keep doing that, and it'll
help someone someday.

303
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:02,791
[GAUCHE] All right. I know
what I have to do now.

304
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,333
Finral!

305
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,833
Get ready. We're goin'
back to that cave.

306
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:08,791
You're not serious, right?

307
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:11,333
[FINRAL] Also, stop ordering
around your superior!

308
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:13,500
[FINRAL] I mean, even if you
do go, how are you planning

309
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:16,291
to handle the guy with the
crazy-powerful Light Magic?

310
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:17,916
He had you pinned before.

311
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,166
Maybe we should wait for
reinforcements from HQ.

312
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,541
I have an idea of
how we might beat him.

313
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:24,958
Huh?

314
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:27,500
I'm not saying it'll be easy,
but unless I'm wrong,

315
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:29,083
I think we have a shot.

316
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,083
I hope your big plan
isn't a sneak attack

317
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:33,291
with my Spatial Magic.

318
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:35,125
Extremely powerful
mages like him

319
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:37,166
are surrounded by
a mana forcefield.

320
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,250
I won't be able
to get you past it.

321
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:42,750
Besides, I've already
moved a lot of people

322
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,708
over great distances today.

323
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:45,916
I've expended so much mana,

324
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,708
I might only have
one spell left in me.

325
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:50,000
[GAUCHE]
That's all I need.

326
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:53,541
Finral. Please!

327
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:03,375
[LICHT] The wait is over.
Your end is upon you.

[YAMI]
Dark Magic: Black Cocoon.

329
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:10,041
What kind of spell is this?

330
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:12,875
Went into defense mode
to buy us some time.

331
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:14,916
'Course, we're probably
still gonna die.

332
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Die?

333
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:17,791
And we're just supposed
to accept that?

334
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:19,208
No! Here I go!

335
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,166
I'm gonna knock that spell
of his right back at him!

336
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,291
[YAMI]
Try it and the only thing

337
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:23,916
that'll be left of you
is that sword.

338
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,291
[ASTA]
Come on, Captain!

339
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,916
There's gotta be
something we can do!

340
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,083
Well, guess we could
try not givin' up.

341
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:33,500
That's an awesome idea!

342
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,291
[YAMI]
We're in serious trouble.

343
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:41,750
He's got us cornered and there's
not a damn thing we can do.

344
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:44,000
[YAMI] Grit your teeth
and dig in your heels.

345
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:45,708
That's all we've got.

346
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:52,416
Take your last breath,
Yami Sukehiro.

347
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,833
Uh, Gauche. What happened here?

348
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:58,416
Are we in the wrong place?

349
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,791
No, look!

350
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,125
[FINRAL]
I see it! That's Yami's magic.

351
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:03,458
Oh, boy.

352
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:06,666
I think we stepped in the
middle of something big!

Engaging Light Magic:

354

Ray of Divine Punishment.

355
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:15,250
And we're dead.

356
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:18,791
He came back?

357
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:22,416
Go Mirror Magic:
Full Reflection!

358
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:39,791
Your magic might be
fast and powerful.

359
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:42,625
But Mirror will
always reflect Light.

360
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:06,500
Who do these people
think they are?

361
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:08,541
To have injured
Sally so badly...

362
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:12,000
Awful. Unforgivable.

363
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:16,333
[yawns] Well, it's gonna be
a pain, but it looks like

364
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:19,166
it's about time for
us to do our thing.

No! Marie's sick?

369
00:23:06,666 --> 00:23:08,000
Did she catch a cold?

370
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:09,833
It's from being
in that dank cave!

371
00:23:09,916 --> 00:23:11,791
Are you okay, my angel?

372
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:13,375
[YAMI'S voice] I'm fine.
My throat's a little sore,

373
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:14,416
that's all.

374
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,541
Hold on. My voice sounds funny.

375
00:23:17,625 --> 00:23:18,875
What? No!

376
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:20,416
Why does my precious,
perfect angel

377
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,708
sound just like Captain Yami?

378
00:23:22,791 --> 00:23:24,166
Never mind, Big Brother.

379
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:25,291
Just forget about me.

380
00:23:25,375 --> 00:23:27,166
Asta's the one who
needs your help now!

381
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:28,833
[YAMI'S voice]
Take my magic power with you.

382
00:23:28,916 --> 00:23:30,166
You might need it.

383
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,000
Not you, too, old hag!

384
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:33,375
[YAMI'S voice]
I've used up so much mana,

385
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:35,250
I might only have
one spell left in me.

386
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:37,041
And Finral now?
