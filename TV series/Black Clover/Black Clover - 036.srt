[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:18,833
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:24,416
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,041
stepped forward
and took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:35,583
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:39,833
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:44,166
[NARRATOR] Yami and Asta were
locked in a desperate battle

8
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,250
against Licht, their
defeat all but certain.

9
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:50,958
Take your last breath,
Yami Sukehiro.

Ray of Divine Punishment.

some unexpected help arrived.

He came back?

14
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:03,791
Go Mirror Magic:
Full Reflection!

15
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:05,708
[NARRATOR] Gauche's spell
reflected Licht's attack

16
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:09,375
back at its caster,
saving the Magic Knights.

17
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:12,500
Your magic might be
fast and powerful.

18
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:15,125
But Mirror will
always reflect Light.

19
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:16,875
[NARRATOR] It was a
close call, but the leader

20
00:01:16,958 --> 00:01:19,916
of the Eye of the Midnight Sun
was finally defeated.

How are we all still alive?

26
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,250
My Mirror Magic
reflected his attack.

27

I didn't see it
hit the smug bastard,

[YAMI laughs]
Ooh. Is that so?

36
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,250
Then I get all the credit for
beatin' the light mage, right?

[ASTA] What kinda
sense does <i>that</i> make?

38

--Shut it.
--[ASTA yelping]

[YAMI] So you think
since you beat Skinnybones

41
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,833
you can just say whatever
you want now, huh?

42
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:50,625
Hey, the important thing is
that everybody did his best.

43
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:52,458
There's no need for violence.

44
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:54,083
[YAMI, GAUCHE]
Oh, yeah? What'd you do?

45
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:56,458
[FINRAL] Excuse me?
It was my Spatial Magic

46
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:57,833
that made it all possible!

00:03:57,916 --> 00:04:00,458

And soon, you'll be in my arms,

Well, anyway. I told you I only
had one more spell in me.

00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:22,208
Nobody's leaving this cave

159
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:39,500
Good job! I'm proud of you.

160
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:42,916
And Asta? He came back
with you, didn't he?

161
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,833
He stayed behind at the cave.

162
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:45,708
[NOELLE]
What?

163
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:46,750
He's still there.

164
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:48,708
The battle isn't over yet.

165
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:51,458
[coughs] Yes, another
one showed up.

166
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:53,083
[NUN 31A]
Sister!

167
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,500
Another one?

168
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:55,875
A mage named Licht.

169
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:57,666
The Eye of the
Midnight Sun's leader.

170
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,250
[gasps] And that's who
Asta's still fighting?

171
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,541
[NEIGE] He's there with a man
named Captain Yami, and--

172
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,000
[MARIE]
My brother went to help, too.

173
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:06,666
A man who uses
Spatial Magic took him.

174
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,291
I know they're gonna be fine.

175
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:10,541
There's nothing my
big brother can't do!

176
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:13,083
Yes, I'm sure you're right.
They'll be just fine.

177
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:14,916
All four of them are strong.

178
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,416
They'll come back after
they've defeated him.

179
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,625
[MARIE]
Mm!

180
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:21,375
[NOELLE]
Finral and Gauche, too.

181
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:24,750
If they were here in town,
they could've taken me to Asta.

182
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,750
I mean, not that
it's all about him.

183
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,250
I'm not worried about
Asta or anything.

184
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,291
Magic Knights should
stick together.

185
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,208
It's the principle of the thing.

186
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:34,750
[ALL]
Uh...

187
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,333
Let it go.

188
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:38,333
Okay, and... who are you?

189
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:39,708
[gasps]

190
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:43,916
[NEIGE] Well, um, i-it's
kind of a long story.

191
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,791
[yawns]

192
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,416
Can we get outta here already?

193
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,666
No. You'll have to wait
a little longer.

194
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,416
Like I said, it's
gonna take a while

195
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,500
for my magic power
to regenerate.

196
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:08,750
--[YAMI, GAUCHE] Tch.
--[FINRAL] Again with the "tch"!

197
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,875
[YAMI]
Tch, you like that. Tch. Tch.

198
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:13,625
--Don't let it get to you.
--[FINRAL] But it does!

199
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,666
Well, then, get me
back to Marie.

200
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,791
[FINRAL] Unlike someone,
I didn't get any extra magic.

201
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,666
Though, if we wait longer,

202
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,000
our reunion will be
that much more joyous.

203
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:24,833
Yes. Ha, ha.

204
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,791
That's certainly been
true in the past.

205
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,708
What's been true in the past?

206
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,375
I'm not talking to
you about anything

207
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:31,875
that pertains to Marie!

208
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:33,041
[ASTA]
What? Why not?

209
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:35,500
Anyone who approaches
Marie is my enemy!

210
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,000
[ASTA]
Seriously?!

211
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:38,375
[stomach rumbles]

212
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:41,166
[YAMI]
Ugh. I'm friggin starving here.

213
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,416
Can't you at least use a
portal to get us breakfast?

214
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,791
[FINRAL]
I'm not a delivery service.

215
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:48,166
Tch. Huh?

216
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:53,833
[GAUCHE]
Hm?

217
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:56,958
Is something wrong?

218
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:03,375
That's a lot of mana.

219
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:17,291
[LICHT]
Hm.

220
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,041
Who are they?

221
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,250
More enemies.

222
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,166
Spatial Magic!

223
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:41,083
But he's still
out cold. So, how?

224
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:43,250
[yawns]

225
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:47,458
Oh, man. Looks like something
didn't go as planned.

226
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,916
There was a hell of a battle,
and Licht and Valty

227
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,833
clearly weren't the
winners. [grunts]

228
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:56,166
Cleaning up this mess will
be a real pain, but still--

229
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,791
[yawns]

230
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:00,125
You gotta help out
your friends, right?

231
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:04,625
[RHYA]
Huh. That's a unique design.

232
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:07,041
Well, not that it matters.

233
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:08,833
[YAMI]
This guy moves fast, too.

234
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:12,583
[YAMI] Dark Magic:
Dark Cloaked Lightless Slash!

235
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:18,416
Ow! Jeez. Now, that's
literally a pain.

236
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:22,166
Well, whatever, I can
heal it up easily enough.

237
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:26,583
Light Magic:
Healing Light Particles.

238
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:29,750
The same spell.
This guy can heal, too.

239
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,375
Thank you for coming.

240
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:35,875
I'm sorry. My power alone
was not enough to defeat them.

241
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:38,291
You're hurt. Is it bad?

242
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:42,416
I'm fine. Better now
that you're here.

243
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,375
Yes, it will be all right.

244
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:49,958
Now, Flame Recovery Magic:
Phoenix Robe.

245
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:56,708
[ASTA, GAUCHE,
YAMI, FINRAL gasp]

246
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:01,250
I know you'll succeed
where I failed.

247
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:02,875
Thank you, my friends.

248
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:06,333
Hold on! I thought
this guy was their leader.

249
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:07,416
Ha.

250
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,083
[yawns] See, Licht?

251
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:13,125
Trying to do everything on
your own is way too much work.

252
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:16,291
You insects! Do you know
what we do to people

253
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:18,916
who harm our friends?
I'll show you.

254
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,958
When I'm finished,
your limbs will be torn

255
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:24,375
from your body like wings
plucked off of a butterfly.

256
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:28,375
I detest anybody who
hurts Licht. I hate them.

257
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:31,291
Right. So, who are
these people, exactly?

258
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,416
I'll introduce you.

259
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,500
These three are the strongest
members of the Midnight Sun.

260
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,250
They're the strongest?

261
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:44,291
[LICHT] Indeed. Their
power surpasses my own,

262
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:47,000
especially when
it comes to battle.

263
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:49,750
They are the Third Eye.

264
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,625
And they're more
powerful than you?

265
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:54,583
So... Third Eye, huh?

266
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:57,208
That's impossible.
Stronger than a Light mage?

267
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:59,458
He's got to be bluffing
about that, right?

268
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:01,541
[yawns] We wouldn't bother.

269
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:03,833
Bluffing's such a pain, y'know?

270
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:06,250
Your kingdom takes
the clover as its symbol,

271
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:07,916
as befits its name.

272
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,625
Let's consider it, shall we?

273
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:14,500
Each of the clover's leaves
supposedly represents one ideal.

274
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:17,375
None of which your
kingdom truly embraces.

275
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:21,333
They are integrity,
hope, and love.

276
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:22,708
Such pretty words.

277
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:26,541
These three bear titles
with opposite meanings.

278
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:32,333
Antithetical to integrity,
we have Rhya the Disloyal.

279
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:37,291
As the antithesis to hope,
we have Vetto the Despair.

280
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:42,750
And, as the inverse of love,
we have Fana the Hateful.

281
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:46,166
If someone dares to harm Licht,
I will gladly kill them.

282
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,375
Kill.

283
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:49,750
Disloyalty, despair, and hatred.

284
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:51,125
[GAUCHE grunts]

285
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:53,458
Congratulations, those are
some real spiffy names

286
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:55,000
you got there, but
they don't tell me

287
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:57,458
if you're worth a damn
when it comes to a fight.

288
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:59,708
I guess we'll just have
to show you, then.

289
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:02,708
Man, how lame. [yawns]

290

[YAMI grunts]

291
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:05,375
No way.

292

[ASTA]
It's just like Captain Yami's!

293

Copy Magic: Dark Cloaked
Lightless Slash.

294
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,958
Your name's Rhya
the Disloyal, huh?

295
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,500
Swiping spells? Not cool.

296
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:22,166
I'll sue you for
copyright infringement.

297
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:25,333
Watch out!

298
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:27,083
Where are you looking?

299
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:29,666
Beast Magic: Bear Claw.

300
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:37,625
[GAUCHE] Damn it,
I'm still short on magic.

301
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:39,833
[VETTO]
You maggots!

302

[yelps]

303
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:45,125
He dodged it?

304
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:47,916
[YAMI]
Did he pick up on my ki?

305
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,625
[VETTO]
Ha!

306
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,583
[VETTO yells]

307
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,125
Beast Magic: Bear Claw!

308
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,833
[VETTO chuckles]

309
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:07,625
I can't wait to see the look
of despair on your faces

310
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:09,125
when you lose all hope.

311
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:12,083
Nothing seasons a meal
better than abject misery.

312
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:14,750
Hey, you! That katana
was special order

313
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:17,875
and very expensive!
You owe me big!

314
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:19,375
Really, sir?

315
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:20,958
