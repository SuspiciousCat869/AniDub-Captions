[NARRATOR]
The Clover Kingdom.

2
00:00:24,222 --> 00:00:26,641
In this place where
magic is everything,

3
00:00:26,725 --> 00:00:29,602
there lives one boy
who was born without it.

4
00:00:29,686 --> 00:00:31,938
His name is Asta.

5
00:00:33,398 --> 00:00:34,816
[NARRATOR]
His strength and determination

6
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:37,152
helped him become
a Magic Knight.

7
00:00:37,235 --> 00:00:39,779
And despite the many
challenges he faces,

8
00:00:39,863 --> 00:00:43,575
he aims for the top
and refuses to give up!

9
00:00:43,658 --> 00:00:45,326
Rich or poor,

10
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:47,412
royalty or commoner,

11
00:00:47,495 --> 00:00:50,290
Asta believes anyone can shine.

12
00:00:50,373 --> 00:00:53,376
His mission is to prove
that to the whole world

13
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,379
and to become the
next Wizard King!

14
00:00:57,672 --> 00:00:59,341
[NARRATOR]
During his time off,

15
00:00:59,424 --> 00:01:02,552
Asta paid a visit
to Hage Village.

16
00:01:02,635 --> 00:01:05,263
On the way, he unexpectedly
met up with Yuno,

17
00:01:05,347 --> 00:01:08,433
who was also returning home.

18
00:01:08,516 --> 00:01:10,727
When they arrived,
they learned that the villagers

19
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:13,772
had already heard the rumors
regarding Asta's alleged

20
00:01:13,855 --> 00:01:15,982
involvement with a devil.

21
00:01:16,066 --> 00:01:17,901
I saw you in the newspaper.

22
00:01:17,984 --> 00:01:20,070
Oh, yeah. I can explain. Uh--

23
00:01:20,153 --> 00:01:22,113
That article isn't
correct at all.

24
00:01:22,197 --> 00:01:24,657
Asta isn't being
controlled by a devil.

25
00:01:24,741 --> 00:01:27,327
He's doing everything
he can to defeat devils.

26
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:29,537
That's the truth behind it.

27
00:01:29,621 --> 00:01:31,664
[NARRATOR] In reality,
no one in the village

28
00:01:31,748 --> 00:01:34,084
had doubted Asta for a second.

29
00:01:34,167 --> 00:01:37,170
On the contrary, they were
deeply proud of him and Yuno

30
00:01:37,253 --> 00:01:40,965
for becoming Magic Knights
and protecting Hage.

31
00:01:41,049 --> 00:01:44,552
Though their visit was brief,
it was quite pleasant.

32
00:01:44,636 --> 00:01:48,348
[YUNO] Our story's not over yet.
It's only the beginning, Asta.

33
00:01:48,431 --> 00:01:50,517
[ASTA]
Let's protect everyone.

34
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,560
[YUNO]
And keep moving forward.

00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:31,826
[ASTA yelling]

36
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,286
Just you wait and see, Yuno!

37
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:35,747
I'm gonna become so awesome,
it'll make your head spin!

38
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:38,625
[MAGNA] Somebody's fired up
first thing in the morning!

39
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:39,959
I don't think
your little rivalry

40
00:03:40,043 --> 00:03:41,628
is our top priority
right now.

41
00:03:41,711 --> 00:03:43,880
Better make sure you
get all your nutrients!

42
00:03:43,963 --> 00:03:45,090
Wow, thanks!

43
00:03:45,173 --> 00:03:47,759
Aw, yeah! Now I'm ready!

44
00:03:47,842 --> 00:03:50,011
We need to start
building our skills!

45
00:03:50,095 --> 00:03:53,223
Then we can hit that devil
with everything we've got!

46
00:03:53,306 --> 00:03:55,850
[CHARMY] In that case,
everybody eat up, right now!

47
00:03:55,934 --> 00:03:58,895
Thanks, Charmy.
This is delicious!

[yelps]

got a cake to the face!

[MAGNA]
Who's making that racket?

52
00:04:05,735 --> 00:04:07,696
Don't you know this hideout
is the home of the Black Bulls,

53
00:04:07,779 --> 00:04:10,532
AKA the future best
Magic Knight Squad in the--

54
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,037
Whoa, why does this
moment feel so familiar?

55
00:04:16,121 --> 00:04:20,542
Hey, it's the scary lady!
Captain Mereoleona!

56
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,919
You should do something
about that weak door of yours.

57
00:04:23,003 --> 00:04:26,798
Uh, hello there, what can
we do for you today, ma'am?

58
00:04:26,881 --> 00:04:28,925
[MEREOLEONA] I don't see
Yami, but that's fine.

59
00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:32,262
Everyone in this room is
coming with me, immediately.

60
00:04:32,345 --> 00:04:33,680
[BLACK BULLS]
Huh?

61
00:04:34,973 --> 00:04:38,852
[NOELLE] I have nothing but
bad feelings about this!

62
00:04:38,935 --> 00:04:41,730
You could have at least
let me finish eating my food!

63
00:04:41,813 --> 00:04:44,107
Yay! This'll be fun!

64
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,316
With all due respect, ma'am,

65
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,610
can you just kidnap
a whole squad this way?

66
00:04:47,694 --> 00:04:50,030
Could you maybe at least
tell us where we're going?

67
00:04:50,113 --> 00:04:52,657
Quiet! You'll see shortly.

68
00:04:59,706 --> 00:05:01,791
[BLACK BULLS]
I'm confused.

69
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:03,418
Wait, what just happened?

70
00:05:03,501 --> 00:05:04,794
One minute we're at the hideout,

71
00:05:04,878 --> 00:05:07,213
and now we're surrounded
by molten lava?

72
00:05:07,297 --> 00:05:09,299
Ooh, how exciting is this?

73
00:05:09,382 --> 00:05:10,592
[LUCK laughs]

74
00:05:10,675 --> 00:05:12,427
I can feel the calories
burning away,

75
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,846
and I've got nothing
to replace them with!

76
00:05:14,929 --> 00:05:17,182
Oh, right, I guess this place
can throw you for a loop

77
00:05:17,265 --> 00:05:19,017
if you haven't been here before.

78
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:22,062
It's a strong magic region:
Yultim Volcano!

00:05:22,145 --> 00:05:24,105
[MAGNA]
Yultim, huh?

80
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:25,482
[NOELLE]
Excuse me, ma'am,

81
00:05:25,565 --> 00:05:27,942
but why exactly did
you bring us here?

82
00:05:28,026 --> 00:05:29,944
For your training, of course!

83
00:05:30,028 --> 00:05:30,779
[NOELLE, ASTA]
Oh, right.

Leo and Captain Fuegoleon!

00:05:36,201 --> 00:05:38,244
It's good to see my rival again.

87
00:05:38,328 --> 00:05:39,829
You must've been
pretty busy lately,

88
00:05:39,913 --> 00:05:42,332
dealing with the elf
attack and a devil.

89
00:05:42,415 --> 00:05:44,584
That's right. I heard that
you were on the front lines

90
00:05:44,668 --> 00:05:47,337
fighting with the
Crimson Lion Kings!

91
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,547
Wait, is it just me,
or have you gotten taller?

92
00:05:49,631 --> 00:05:50,924
Yeah, but that's
not the only thing

93
00:05:51,007 --> 00:05:52,175
different about me.

94
00:05:52,258 --> 00:05:54,177
I've been improving my
skills as a mage, too!

95
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,553
Oh, really?

96
00:05:55,637 --> 00:05:57,972
Well, my muscles are bigger,
so I'll still beat you!

97
00:05:58,056 --> 00:05:59,933
[RANDALL]
Hello, Black Bulls.

98
00:06:00,016 --> 00:06:02,602
Can you spare a moment?

99
00:06:02,686 --> 00:06:05,980
I happen to be the vice captain
of the Crimson Lion Kings.

100
00:06:06,064 --> 00:06:08,566
My name is Randall Luftair.

101
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:09,943
During the last battle,

102
00:06:10,026 --> 00:06:13,279
the three of us had our
bodies taken over by elves.

103
00:06:13,363 --> 00:06:15,407
And even though we weren't
in control of our actions,

104
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:17,992
we're exceedingly sorry
for betraying our land.

105
00:06:18,076 --> 00:06:19,577
Don't apologize!

106
00:06:19,661 --> 00:06:21,955
None of us are to blame for what
happened except for the devil

107
00:06:22,038 --> 00:06:23,623
who messed with
everybody's heads!

108
00:06:23,707 --> 00:06:25,583
And I hear the devil
in the Spade Kingdom

109
00:06:25,667 --> 00:06:27,794
is an even greater threat.

110
00:06:27,877 --> 00:06:31,089
Our squads must be strong
to protect our nation.

111
00:06:31,172 --> 00:06:33,717
But, in order to prove
Asta's innocence,

112
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,803
we'll each have to improve
ourselves individually, as well.

113
00:06:36,886 --> 00:06:39,723
Precisely, so just
like before, my own squad,

114
00:06:39,806 --> 00:06:42,058
the Crimson Lion Kings,
will be training alongside

115
00:06:42,142 --> 00:06:43,685
the others I invited.

116
00:06:43,768 --> 00:06:45,186
[MAGIC KNIGHTS]
Right!

117
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,439
[NOELLE] We weren't so much
"invited" as "abducted,"

118
00:06:47,522 --> 00:06:49,315
but sure, whatever.

119
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:50,859
Here we go!

120
00:06:50,942 --> 00:06:53,737
Let's race to the top so we
can hit that sweet hot spring!

--Hold it.
--[ASTA yells]

122

There'll be no
climbing this time.

00:06:58,658 --> 00:07:01,661
Instead, I'm going to
have you venture below.

124
00:07:01,745 --> 00:07:03,913
To the Underground Cave!

125
00:07:03,997 --> 00:07:04,956
[MAGIC KNIGHTS]
Huh?

126
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,207
[NOELLE]
There's a cave?

127
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:08,335
[CRIMSON LIONS]
But what's down there?

128
00:07:08,418 --> 00:07:11,212
[MEREOLEONA] This place
is a strong magic region.

129
00:07:11,296 --> 00:07:13,506
Because deep
beneath the surface

130
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:16,301
lies a great mana heat source!

131
00:07:16,384 --> 00:07:18,053
Rocks that are soaked
in that mana

132
00:07:18,136 --> 00:07:20,764
become lava and burst upward.

133
00:07:20,847 --> 00:07:23,600
Which means,
the further you descend,

134
00:07:23,683 --> 00:07:27,562
the more intense the heat
source's influence will become.

135
00:07:28,772 --> 00:07:30,940
[MEREOLEONA]
If your Mana Skin falters,

136
00:07:31,024 --> 00:07:34,027
your body will be exposed
to the extreme heat,

137
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:37,489
and you will be
reduced to ashes.

138
00:07:37,572 --> 00:07:39,699
However, you'll be
pleased to hear

139
00:07:39,783 --> 00:07:42,744
that the hot spring awaiting you
in the deepest part of the cave

140
00:07:42,827 --> 00:07:46,623
is even more satisfying
than the one at the peak!

141
00:07:46,706 --> 00:07:49,751
Now then, does
that motivate you?

142
00:07:49,834 --> 00:07:51,628
[SECRÉ]
Hot spring.

143
00:07:51,711 --> 00:07:53,129
Yeah, I don't like this.

144
00:07:53,213 --> 00:07:55,340
I'd be a lot more comfortable
in a sweets region

145
00:07:55,423 --> 00:07:57,801
overflowing with
honey, not lava!

146
00:07:57,884 --> 00:08:00,553
Believe me, you're
not ready for that!

147
00:08:00,637 --> 00:08:01,930
[GORDON]
It's real?

148
00:08:02,013 --> 00:08:04,432
Okay, someone gonna tell me
what Mana Skin means?

149
00:08:04,516 --> 00:08:05,433
Uh...

150
00:08:05,517 --> 00:08:07,310
It's a defensive technique.

151
00:08:07,394 --> 00:08:10,021
To put it simply,
it's a way of enhancing

152
00:08:10,105 --> 00:08:13,108
your physical abilities
through mana.

153
00:08:13,191 --> 00:08:16,152
It's magic in its perfect state.

154
00:08:16,236 --> 00:08:19,489
Simply wrap your magic around
yourself, and it will form

155
00:08:19,572 --> 00:08:23,410
a protective shield of
mana to cover your body.

156
00:08:23,493 --> 00:08:26,287
Hang on, you can't expect us
to do it right off the bat!

157
00:08:26,371 --> 00:08:28,456
Then I guess you'll

I think that giant

You want me to starve?

I see. That spider must be

what the other monsters were
trying to hide from before!

Don't get all cocky, Noelle,
we're right behind you!

I'm gonna get results
like no one has before.

[LEOPOLD] Even though you
were nothing but a commoner

with no magic, when you
told us about your dreams,

I felt something
deep in my heart.

Since then, we've
fought together,

competed against each other

Sun did to my brother.

Either way, it's not
the end for me.

to worry about that!

You see,

00:20:12,952 --> 00:20:15,163
that mutant bug recently
showed up and started eating

all the other creatures
that live here.

I was hoping to
teach it a lesson,

but it seems to be able to sense
foes that are too strong for it,

446
00:20:24,464 --> 00:20:28,009
so it never shows
itself in my presence.

That's why I decided to bring
all of you down here instead.

And, of course,
it tried to devour you,

Except this spider is more
dangerous than a typical mutant.

462
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:05,130
I sense man-made mana in it.

Mana that it definitely
didn't possess at birth.

Quite strange.

must be what allowed it

to conceal itself from you.

form of camouflage
