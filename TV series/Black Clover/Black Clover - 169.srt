1
00:00:22,554 --> 00:00:25,557
[NARRATOR] Within the clover's
fifth leaf, there lives a devil.

2
00:00:27,225 --> 00:00:29,686
[NARRATOR] Asta, born
unable to harness mana,

3
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:31,479
was granted the
power of Anti-magic

4
00:00:31,563 --> 00:00:33,314
from his five-leaf grimoire,

5
00:00:33,398 --> 00:00:37,068
giving him the ability
to nullify spells.

6
00:00:37,152 --> 00:00:39,696
Unfortunately, the members
of Spade Kingdom's

7
00:00:39,779 --> 00:00:42,365
Dark Triad also possess
powers from the devils

8
00:00:42,449 --> 00:00:44,242
of the underworld and used them

9
00:00:44,325 --> 00:00:47,620
to launch an invasion on
the neighboring countries.

10
00:00:47,704 --> 00:00:49,664
Gaining strength from
his belief in himself

11
00:00:49,748 --> 00:00:51,833
and from the support
of his friends,

12
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:55,086
Asta continues to fight for
the safety of this world.

13
00:00:59,966 --> 00:01:02,177
[ASTA, YAMI yelling]

14
00:01:04,179 --> 00:01:07,724
[NARRATOR] In a fierce battle,
Yami and Asta defeated Dante.

15
00:01:07,807 --> 00:01:10,143
[ASTA] Looks like we
haven't lost after all.

16
00:01:10,226 --> 00:01:13,313
[NARRATOR] Then, Zenon appeared
and took Yami away,

17
00:01:13,396 --> 00:01:15,648
along with Captain
William Vangeance.

18
00:01:15,732 --> 00:01:19,652
[ASTA]
Captain Yami, no!

19
00:01:19,736 --> 00:01:21,279
[ASTA gasps]

20
00:01:21,363 --> 00:01:22,781
[pants]

21
00:01:23,948 --> 00:01:26,409
[NARRATOR] That night,
when Asta tried to sneak away

22
00:01:26,493 --> 00:01:31,539
from the infirmary tower to
save Yami, he met someone new.

23
00:01:31,623 --> 00:01:34,542
It was Nacht, Vice Captain
of the Black Bulls.

24
00:01:34,626 --> 00:01:37,837
[NACHT] I can teach you how
to use your devil power.

25
00:01:37,921 --> 00:01:40,006
If you would like
to learn, that is.

26
00:01:42,175 --> 00:01:45,637
[NARRATOR] Nacht carried Asta to
the emergency captains' meeting.

27
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,098
[NOZEL]
Tell us. Who are you?

28
00:01:48,181 --> 00:01:50,642
This man is with
the Black Bulls.

29
00:01:50,725 --> 00:01:52,602
He's their vice captain.

30
00:01:52,686 --> 00:01:55,814
He'd been operating in the
Spade Kingdom as a spy.

31
00:01:55,897 --> 00:01:59,651
However, I was unaware
that he was possessed.

32
00:01:59,734 --> 00:02:01,903
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
in the Spade Kingdom,

33
00:02:01,986 --> 00:02:05,490
the ritual to bring about the
advent of Qliphoth was underway.

34
00:02:05,573 --> 00:02:08,743
At its completion, a path would
be opened to the underworld,

35
00:02:08,827 --> 00:02:11,621
and Yami and Vangeance, who were
being offered as sacrifices,

36
00:02:11,705 --> 00:02:13,707
would lose their lives
in the process.

37
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:16,501
In three days,
the first of seven gates

38
00:02:16,584 --> 00:02:19,754
to the underworld will open,
unless the Dark Triad

39
00:02:19,838 --> 00:02:21,256
is stopped before then.

40
00:02:21,339 --> 00:02:23,258
[FUEGOLEON] In that case,
we'd better reach out to Heart

41
00:02:23,341 --> 00:02:24,884
for assistance, as well.

42
00:02:24,968 --> 00:02:28,471
I've tried, but they haven't
answered me all day.

43
00:02:28,555 --> 00:02:31,558
[NARRATOR] For a moment, it
seemed as though Vanica's magic

44
00:02:31,641 --> 00:02:33,727
had decimated the Heart Kingdom.

45
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:34,811
But...

46
00:02:38,523 --> 00:02:39,774
[gasps]

47
00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:44,821
I don't believe it!

48
00:04:21,251 --> 00:04:23,086
This is crazy.

49
00:04:24,754 --> 00:04:27,173
[NOELLE] The Eye of the
Midnight Sun's leader,

50
00:04:27,257 --> 00:04:29,843
and the elves from
the Third Eye.

51
00:04:31,928 --> 00:04:33,805
You guys!

52
00:04:35,807 --> 00:04:37,142
Where are we?

53
00:04:52,157 --> 00:04:53,950
[PATRY]
This is Elysia.

54
00:04:54,034 --> 00:04:56,870
A secluded part of
a strong magic region,

55
00:04:56,953 --> 00:04:59,873
deep within the Heart Kingdom.

56
00:04:59,956 --> 00:05:02,917
[NOELLE] The mana here
is incredibly dense.

57
00:05:06,212 --> 00:05:08,923
Oh. So they're awake.

58
00:05:09,007 --> 00:05:11,634
[NOELLE]
Who are those two?

59
00:05:11,718 --> 00:05:13,803
[PATRY] These children are
the descendants of Licht

60
00:05:13,887 --> 00:05:17,223
and the Clover Kingdom's
Princess Tetia.

61
00:05:17,307 --> 00:05:18,141
[BOTH gasp]

62
00:05:18,224 --> 00:05:20,560
[SECRÉ gasps]

63
00:05:20,643 --> 00:05:22,020
[SECRÉ]
Back then...

64
00:05:35,158 --> 00:05:39,537
[SECRÉ]
Lady Tetia. She's still alive!

65
00:05:41,998 --> 00:05:44,417
[SECRÉ] Judging by this
mana, one of the twins

66
00:05:44,501 --> 00:05:47,253
she was carrying must
have survived, as well!

67
00:05:51,508 --> 00:05:53,259
[SECRÉ]
As soon as I realized that,

68
00:05:53,343 --> 00:05:55,804
I sealed Lady Tetia's wounds.

69
00:05:55,887 --> 00:05:58,181
Then, I rushed to
the Prince's side.

70
00:06:01,267 --> 00:06:02,477
[SECRÉ]
After that...

71
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:21,204
[SECRÉ] I woke up
in the form of a bird.

72
00:06:21,287 --> 00:06:24,332
Many years had gone by,
and I had no idea

73
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:26,626
what had become of the princess.

74
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:30,880
[SECRÉ]
But she made it.

75
00:06:33,717 --> 00:06:36,845
[SECRÉ] Despite everything,
her life was saved!

76
00:06:36,928 --> 00:06:39,639
The children of
an elf and a human.

77
00:06:42,642 --> 00:06:44,102
[SECRÉ]
Prince Lumiere.

78
00:06:44,185 --> 00:06:46,438
The lives you always hoped for.

79
00:06:46,521 --> 00:06:48,773
The new world you wished for.

80
00:06:48,857 --> 00:06:50,191
They're here!

81
00:06:52,861 --> 00:06:56,531
The place that we're in is
the new home of the elves.

82
00:06:57,949 --> 00:06:59,325
[PATRY]
When we found it,

83
00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:01,244
I felt as though I
understood the reason

84
00:07:01,327 --> 00:07:03,913
we stayed behind in this era.

85
00:07:08,835 --> 00:07:10,295
I hope I'm not overstepping,

86
00:07:10,378 --> 00:07:12,964
but why did you
decide to rescue us?

87
00:07:13,048 --> 00:07:14,799
We received a divine word.

88
00:07:14,883 --> 00:07:19,054
From Dryad, the guardian
deity who protects Elysia.

89
00:07:20,055 --> 00:07:21,723
Guardian deity?

90
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:25,685
[PATRY]
We were told to help you.

91
00:07:25,769 --> 00:07:28,646
We rushed to the Heart Kingdom
as soon as we heard,

92
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,273
but we were too late.

93
00:07:36,863 --> 00:07:38,406
[PATRY]
Thankfully...

94
00:07:42,202 --> 00:07:44,537
[PATRY] All of you had somehow
used your own powers

95
00:07:44,621 --> 00:07:47,207
to survive those
massive explosions.

96
00:08:30,792 --> 00:08:32,002
[PATRY]
Because of you,

97
00:08:32,085 --> 00:08:34,629
the citizens of the Heart
Kingdom were saved.

98
00:08:37,173 --> 00:08:38,967
I'm amazed that you
were able to persevere

99
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:41,052
against foes like them.

100
00:08:41,136 --> 00:08:43,680
You've clearly become
much stronger of late.

101
00:08:47,017 --> 00:08:49,894
[NOELLE]
Persevering isn't enough.

102
00:08:49,978 --> 00:08:52,439
After all of those
months of training,

103
00:08:52,522 --> 00:08:54,399
I should've been
able to defeat them,

104
00:08:54,482 --> 00:08:57,527
and make sure the world
was safe for good!

105
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,904
Now that they've
got Loropechika,

106
00:08:59,988 --> 00:09:02,949
who knows what's going
to happen to her!

107
00:09:03,033 --> 00:09:04,325
That's why...

108
00:09:06,411 --> 00:09:08,663
We all need to build
our fighting skills!

109
00:09:08,747 --> 00:09:09,998
And quickly!

110
00:09:10,081 --> 00:09:11,708
The four of you are
even better mages

111
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:12,917
than we are, correct?

112
00:09:13,001 --> 00:09:16,004
So tell me how you got
that way, right now!

113
00:09:16,087 --> 00:09:17,422
Look at you!

114
00:09:17,505 --> 00:09:19,758
Is that really the proper way
to ask someone to help,

115
00:09:19,841 --> 00:09:22,177
Little Miss Royalty?

116
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,970
You lost to these
enemies after months

117
00:09:24,054 --> 00:09:27,390
of hard training, and you
think, if you grow a bit more,

118
00:09:27,474 --> 00:09:29,351
that you'll be able to win?

119
00:09:31,478 --> 00:09:36,316
Not exactly. I know
it's not that easy.

120
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:41,905
But... giving up would be
even more impossible for me!

121
00:09:41,988 --> 00:09:44,699
We'll try! Right, everyone?

122
00:09:44,783 --> 00:09:46,951
[MIMOSA, SECRÉ]
That's right!

123
00:09:47,035 --> 00:09:48,286
I see.

124
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:51,664
You guys are still a pain,
like you always were.

125
00:09:51,748 --> 00:09:56,294
Then, we'll teach you an
elven art, ultimate magic!

126
00:09:56,378 --> 00:09:57,754
That should help you.

127
00:10:01,091 --> 00:10:03,593
I can't stop worrying.

128
00:10:04,594 --> 00:10:07,305
I sure hope Charmy
and the others are okay.

129
00:10:13,937 --> 00:10:14,979
[ALL gasp]

130
00:10:18,024 --> 00:10:19,067
[ASTA]
Gaja!

131
00:10:24,781 --> 00:10:28,451
All right, I think
I'm up to speed.

132
00:10:28,535 --> 00:10:30,704
We're attacking Spade
in three days,

133
00:10:30,787 --> 00:10:33,039
in the early morning hours.

134
00:10:33,123 --> 00:10:34,374
What will you do?

135
00:10:34,457 --> 00:10:36,543
Our forces will fight with you.

136
00:10:36,626 --> 00:10:39,879
All of the Spirit
Guardians are safe.

137
00:10:39,963 --> 00:10:41,923
On the honor of
the Heart Kingdom,

138
00:10:42,007 --> 00:10:44,384
we will rescue our queen.

139
00:10:44,467 --> 00:10:47,971
Lady Noelle and the others are
preparing to reenter the fray.

140
00:10:48,054 --> 00:10:51,558
Whether they make it
in time depends on them.

141
00:10:51,641 --> 00:10:54,352
Understood, thank you
for reaching out to us.

142
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:10,785
[GAJA] I will save you,
no matter what.

143
00:11:10,869 --> 00:11:14,873
[CHARLOTTE] I refuse to
let them take his life.

144
00:11:14,956 --> 00:11:17,625
Wait for me, Yami!

145
00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:19,002
Well, on the bright side,

146
00:11:19,085 --> 00:11:21,379
Charmy, the other Magic Knights
and Spirit Guardians

147
00:11:21,463 --> 00:11:22,756
are all safe!

148
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:24,716
Sounds like they're
training some more!

149
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,593
It's time for me
to get back to it!

150
00:11:26,676 --> 00:11:28,470
Vice Captain!

151
00:11:28,553 --> 00:11:32,640
Uh, that's weird.
Where did you go?

152
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:54,662
In three days, we'll
gather the most elite

153
00:11:54,746 --> 00:11:57,040
of the Magic Knights,
and initiate an attack

154
00:11:57,123 --> 00:12:00,877
against the Spade Kingdom.

155
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,837
I'm sorry.

156
00:12:02,921 --> 00:12:05,632
You're the vice captain
of the Black Bulls?

157
00:12:05,715 --> 00:12:07,342
If that's true,

158
00:12:07,425 --> 00:12:10,387
then why have we never
seen you before?

159
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:13,598
Simply put, it's because
I hate the Black Bulls.

160
00:12:15,475 --> 00:12:19,020
I'm content as long as I can
still be a Magic Knight.

161
00:12:19,104 --> 00:12:20,897
Being a vice captain
is convenient

162
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:23,817
because I can do as I please.

163
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,778
I despise people who
can't do things properly,

164
00:12:26,861 --> 00:12:29,239
and the Black Bulls
are a squad with a reputation

165
00:12:29,322 --> 00:12:33,618
for creating more
problems than they solve.

166
00:12:33,702 --> 00:12:37,205
You may have done well in
the battle six months ago,

167
00:12:37,288 --> 00:12:41,126
but that doesn't even begin
to erase all your past failures.

168
00:12:42,752 --> 00:12:45,797
[NACHT] The witch with
a drinking problem.

169
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,799
The Spatial mage
whose philandering

170
00:12:47,882 --> 00:12:51,052
interfered with
countless missions.

171
00:12:51,136 --> 00:12:54,055
The ex-noble-slash-convict.

172
00:12:54,139 --> 00:12:57,851
And, as for the ones who
aren't around at the moment...

173
00:12:57,934 --> 00:12:59,394
You've got an
evil-looking delinquent

174
00:12:59,477 --> 00:13:02,063
commoner, and another evil-
looking delinquent commoner

175
00:13:02,147 --> 00:13:06,276
just like him,
except he wears a mask.

176
00:13:06,359 --> 00:13:08,486
The point is that your
good-for-nothing captain

177
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,530
built a team of losers.

178
00:13:12,782 --> 00:13:15,410
But, all of them
are wonderful people!

179
00:13:15,493 --> 00:13:18,329
You shouldn't judge them
because of the way they look!

180
00:13:18,413 --> 00:13:20,331
If you don't want to be
judged by your looks,

181
00:13:20,415 --> 00:13:23,043
then you need to change
the way you present yourself.

182
00:13:25,378 --> 00:13:28,340
[NACHT] Sometimes, those who
seem evil or have a history

183
00:13:28,423 --> 00:13:33,636
of evil deeds will do something
good, making them more likeable.

184
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,097
But that is disgusting to me.

185
00:13:38,308 --> 00:13:41,978
[NACHT] I vastly prefer people
who are good from the start.

186
00:13:43,813 --> 00:13:46,232
[NACHT] And that doesn't
apply to any of you.

187
00:13:48,568 --> 00:13:51,863
[NACHT] If you still want to
save that worthless man's life,

188
00:13:51,946 --> 00:13:54,783
you have two days
to improve your skills.

189
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:11,424
I've been meaning to ask,
what's your magic?

190
00:14:11,508 --> 00:14:12,676
[NACHT]
Shadow Magic.

191
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:14,886
It moves my body
and anything I touch

192
00:14:14,969 --> 00:14:17,430
from one shadow to the next.

193
00:14:17,514 --> 00:14:19,933
Awesome, so it's kinda
like portals then?

194
00:14:20,016 --> 00:14:21,226
Here we are.

195
00:14:23,186 --> 00:14:24,646
[ASTA]
A house?

196
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:33,780
[ASTA]
Whose place is this?

197
00:14:33,863 --> 00:14:35,782
[NACHT]
It was a noble's house.

198
00:14:35,865 --> 00:14:39,202
Well, former noble.

199
00:14:39,285 --> 00:14:40,328
Here.

200
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:44,207
What's the deal, man?
What are we doing?

201
00:14:45,792 --> 00:14:48,712
[NACHT] Shadow Magic:
Dark Garden Invitation.

202
00:14:52,924 --> 00:14:54,009
[gasps]

203
00:14:58,179 --> 00:15:00,765
[screams]

204
00:15:03,226 --> 00:15:04,561
Where the heck are we?

205
00:15:15,697 --> 00:15:17,198
[NACHT]
For the next two days,

206
00:15:17,282 --> 00:15:20,827
I'll teach you everything I know
about using the power of devils.

207
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:26,041
And your capabilities are
going to grow exponentially.

208
00:15:26,124 --> 00:15:27,625
So it's time to train, then?

209
00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:29,586
Sweet, let's go!

210
00:15:29,669 --> 00:15:31,838
[NACHT] As it stands, you aren't
using your devil's might

211
00:15:31,921 --> 00:15:33,923
to its full potential.

212
00:15:34,007 --> 00:15:35,759
Merely the scraps
of excess power

213
00:15:35,842 --> 00:15:37,844
that happen to
trickle down from it.

214
00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:43,850
This is unorthodox,
but it does work.

215
00:15:43,933 --> 00:15:45,185
To give you complete command,

216
00:15:45,268 --> 00:15:47,020
we'll perform a
devil-binding ritual--

217
00:15:47,103 --> 00:15:48,897
a forbidden ceremony
that requires you to make

218
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,399
a formal deal with your devil.

219
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:53,276
[ASTA]
Devil-binding.

220
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,364
[NACHT] Once we do that, its
full power will become yours.

221
00:15:57,447 --> 00:15:59,741
First, we need a
connection to the devil.

222
00:16:01,201 --> 00:16:04,371
[NACHT] Normally, you'd use
a relic, like what I have.

223
00:16:04,454 --> 00:16:07,123
Something like this would
temporarily allow you to summon

224
00:16:07,207 --> 00:16:10,168
the being from inside
your body to our world.

225
00:16:10,251 --> 00:16:12,962
But you seem to be
a special case.

226
00:16:13,046 --> 00:16:15,048
Your arm. Your grimoire.

227
00:16:15,131 --> 00:16:17,425
In fact, your very
existence has a unique

228
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:20,428
and profound connection
to that devil.

229
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:23,515
[ASTA] Right! So, how am
I supposed to do it?

230
00:16:27,394 --> 00:16:28,728
Summon.

231
00:16:28,812 --> 00:16:29,896
[ASTA gasps]

232
00:16:32,982 --> 00:16:34,067
[ASTA]
What?

233
00:16:40,657 --> 00:16:41,991
The devil.

234
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:44,536
[ASTA]
My arm!

235
00:16:46,287 --> 00:16:48,665
[laughs] How 'bout that?

236
00:16:48,748 --> 00:16:51,710
I wasn't expecting you
to let me out on your own!

237
00:16:54,295 --> 00:16:58,508
Now it's time to
fight him and win.

238
00:16:58,591 --> 00:17:01,469
Use your powers to bend
him to your will.

239
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:04,514
That's the only way to
harness his full strength.

240
00:17:06,766 --> 00:17:11,479
[laughs] Been a while since
I got to stretch my legs.

241
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:13,023
This is weird.

242
00:17:13,106 --> 00:17:15,942
I can't believe he's standing
right here in front of me!

243
00:17:19,904 --> 00:17:21,448
[ASTA] There's something
I've wanted to tell you

244
00:17:21,531 --> 00:17:22,991
for a long time.

245
00:17:25,952 --> 00:17:27,328
Thanks a bunch!

246
00:17:29,831 --> 00:17:31,416
Huh?

247
00:17:31,499 --> 00:17:32,959
That's right. You heard me!

248
00:17:33,043 --> 00:17:34,502
I can't even count
how many times

249
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:36,296
you've helped me in a fight!

250
00:17:50,643 --> 00:17:53,938
[ASTA]
Right here, right now.

251
00:17:54,022 --> 00:17:57,025
I'm going to push
past my limits!

252
00:17:57,108 --> 00:18:00,153
[BOTH yelling]

253
00:18:09,996 --> 00:18:11,790
[ASTA]
As of right now...

254
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,044
This is it! All I've got!

255
00:18:20,465 --> 00:18:21,716
I never would've
been able to win

256
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,219
all those crazy battles
without your help!

257
00:18:24,302 --> 00:18:27,389
I seriously can't
thank you enough for that!

258
00:18:27,472 --> 00:18:30,809
[DEVIL laughs] Wow, so,
I take your right arm,

259
00:18:30,892 --> 00:18:31,935
and you thank me?

260
00:18:32,018 --> 00:18:33,228
Well, that was the
bargain, wasn't it?

261
00:18:33,311 --> 00:18:35,355
I can't really complain!

262
00:18:35,438 --> 00:18:37,232
You're even more
of a hopeless idiot

263
00:18:37,315 --> 00:18:39,192
than I thought you would be.

264
00:18:39,275 --> 00:18:40,777
I guess it doesn't
matter though,

265
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:44,447
because you're about
to be a dead idiot.

266
00:18:44,531 --> 00:18:46,533
Not gonna happen!

267
00:18:46,616 --> 00:18:50,370
Anyway, I just remembered
our first conversation!

268
00:18:50,453 --> 00:18:53,415
[DEVIL] A half-pint like you
doesn't stand a chance

269
00:18:53,498 --> 00:18:55,291
in this fight.

270
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:57,961
You're just as short
as I am, though!

271
00:18:58,044 --> 00:19:00,296
From the way you were talking,
I thought you would be a giant!

272
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,841
I'm not gonna get my butt
kicked by the likes of you!

273
00:19:02,924 --> 00:19:06,261
[laughs] You really have
no idea what kind of mess

274
00:19:06,344 --> 00:19:08,805
you've gotten yourself
into, do you?

275
00:19:15,729 --> 00:19:17,022
[ASTA]
Demon-Slayer!

276
00:19:20,108 --> 00:19:23,278
I told you,
you'll never beat me!

277
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:26,990
Whoa!

278
00:19:27,073 --> 00:19:28,950
Now that you've let me
into your world,

279
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:30,618
I've got the advantage!

280
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:32,746
And I want more than your arm.

281
00:19:32,829 --> 00:19:36,249
This time, I'm going after
every last bit of you!

282
00:19:36,332 --> 00:19:39,544
Ease up for a second!
I don't want to fight you, okay?

283
00:19:39,627 --> 00:19:40,462
I wanna talk--

284
00:19:40,545 --> 00:19:41,796
You'll fight him.

285
00:19:42,922 --> 00:19:44,924
Your intention is to
make yourself stronger,

286
00:19:45,008 --> 00:19:46,426
isn't that right?

287
00:19:46,509 --> 00:19:49,179
That means you'll have to
face and defeat your devil.

288
00:19:49,262 --> 00:19:50,930
Right now.

289
00:19:51,014 --> 00:19:52,682
If you lose, he'll take over

290
00:19:52,766 --> 00:19:55,310
and turn you into
a vicious monster.

291
00:19:55,393 --> 00:19:56,770
What?

292
00:19:56,853 --> 00:19:58,772
[NACHT] The skulls you see
on the altar belong to those

293
00:19:58,855 --> 00:20:01,399
who've failed the
devil-binding ritual.

294
00:20:01,483 --> 00:20:03,276
If you don't do this,
I'll dispose of you

295
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,195
and add you to their ranks.

296
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:11,993
Hang on, isn't this
forbidden magic?

297
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:13,536
This ritual thing,

298
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:16,623
is it something we're not
supposed to be doing?

299
00:20:16,706 --> 00:20:19,292
We only have two days.

300
00:20:19,376 --> 00:20:22,337
Did you really think you could
win playing by the rules?

301
00:20:24,547 --> 00:20:27,634
You wanted to grow your skill
despite having no magic,

302
00:20:27,717 --> 00:20:30,679
this is the world
you stepped into.

303
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:32,972
[DEVIL laughs]

304
00:20:33,056 --> 00:20:34,641
[yells]

305
00:20:34,724 --> 00:20:35,725
[ASTA grunts]

306
00:20:37,811 --> 00:20:39,062
What are you doing?

307
00:20:39,145 --> 00:20:42,107
At this rate,
you'll be killed for sure.

308
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:44,359
No. It's okay.

309
00:20:44,442 --> 00:20:47,404
I know from his ki,
he's not trying to kill me.

310
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:48,738
I can tell!

311
00:20:50,657 --> 00:20:52,033
Have you lost your mind?

312
00:20:52,117 --> 00:20:54,494
You're dealing with
a devil, remember?

313
00:20:54,577 --> 00:20:56,871
Creatures like him
don't have principles.

314
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:59,499
[laughs] Got that right!

315
00:20:59,582 --> 00:21:01,001
Trust me on this,

316
00:21:01,084 --> 00:21:04,045
every devil you'll ever meet
is a piece of shit, like me!

317
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:07,424
[ASTA] This guy's different
from the one I fought back then.

318
00:21:07,507 --> 00:21:10,468
I can't wait to take control
of your whole body!

319
00:21:10,552 --> 00:21:12,595
Just 'cause you're a devil,

320
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:16,266
that doesn't automatically mean
you're an evil being at heart!

321
00:21:21,855 --> 00:21:23,189
[LIEBE]
Damn it.

322
00:21:25,066 --> 00:21:26,818
[LICITA, ASTA]
I know the truth.

323
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:32,240
You're not a bad guy!

324
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,709
[FULL CAST]
Clover Clips!

325
00:23:08,294 --> 00:23:09,671
[NACHT]
Vice Captain.

326
00:23:11,881 --> 00:23:13,341
[ASTA]
You know,

327
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:16,428
it's a little bit weird that
we don't have a vice captain.

328
00:23:16,511 --> 00:23:17,804
Yeah, but it kinda
makes sense

329
00:23:17,887 --> 00:23:19,889
when you think about
who our boss is.

330
00:23:19,973 --> 00:23:22,684
Working for him is not
for the faint of heart.

331
00:23:22,767 --> 00:23:24,102
If they wanted
to drink with him,

332
00:23:24,185 --> 00:23:26,813
they'd have to be able
to hold their liquor.

333
00:23:26,896 --> 00:23:28,982
And believe me, they'd need
to be quick on their feet

334
00:23:29,065 --> 00:23:31,943
to handle all those
crazy requests.

335
00:23:32,027 --> 00:23:34,320
I think it would have to be
someone with lots of strength

336
00:23:34,404 --> 00:23:37,115
and courage to stand
by him in battle!

337
00:23:37,198 --> 00:23:39,701
And of course, his number two
would have to wait around

338
00:23:39,784 --> 00:23:42,370
for him to take a number-two!

339
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:44,622
[BLACK BULLS] I guess that's
why we don't have one.

340
00:23:44,706 --> 00:23:47,417
[laughing]

341
00:23:49,586 --> 00:23:52,672
I hate that squad. Hate them!

342
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,637
[NARRATOR] In this place
where magic is everything,

343
00:23:59,721 --> 00:24:02,515
there lives one boy
who was born without it.

344
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:04,684
Despite the many
challenges he faces,

345
00:24:04,768 --> 00:24:06,853
he aims for the top
and refuses to give up!

346
00:24:06,936 --> 00:24:10,648
