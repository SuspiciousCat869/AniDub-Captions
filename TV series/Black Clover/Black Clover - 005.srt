1
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:15,666
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,750
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:24,416
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,208
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:35,458
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:39,583
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,708
[NARRATOR] The exam to join
the ranks of the Magic Knights,

8
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:47,000
the elite squads who
protect the Clover Kingdom

9
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:48,666
under the command
of the Wizard King,

10
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,666
was underway in
the royal capital.

11
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,750
In the final stage of the exam,

12
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:55,541
candidates are pitted
against each other

13
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:57,625
to assess their combat
skills and observe

14
00:00:57,708 --> 00:01:00,375
how they use their
grimoires in battle.

15
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,625
Now, begin.

16
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:05,875
No pulling punches, remember?

17
00:01:05,958 --> 00:01:08,750
Let's do this, Asta. Ha, ha!

18
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:20,041
Bronze Creation Magic:
Sekke Magnum Cannon ball!

19
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:22,250
[SEKKE] What do you think
of this, captains?

20
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:25,500
The bronze magic power
I've crafted is dual-purpose.

21
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:28,375
It protects me and attacks
with magic bullets.

22
00:01:28,458 --> 00:01:30,416
It will fend off
his pathetic attacks,

23
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,416
showing off my
skills at defense.

24
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,500
Then, the second he's exhausted,

25
00:01:34,583 --> 00:01:36,666
I'll go on the
offensive and shoot.

26
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,833
Come on, don't get
shy on me now. Ha, ha!

27
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:15,583
[SHINANA]
Well, this is a done deal.

28
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,708
Some kid from the sticks
doesn't have the power

29
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:19,291
to get past that.

30
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:22,666
[GAYAYA] Man, I wish I coulda
been the one to take him on.

31
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,541
[laughs] And did you
get a look at that

32
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,666
tattered old grimoire of his?

33
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,541
I mean, seriously, do you
think he can even use magic?

34
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:31,791
A no one from Nowheresville.

35
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:34,958
No chance any squad's
gonna make an offer for him.

36
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:39,791
Come on, don't get
shy on me now. Ha, ha!

37
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:41,041
[SEKKE]
Good.

38
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:44,291
Watching him struggle
should liven things up.

39
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:47,083
[ASTA]
Okay. Here we go.

40
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:55,500
[ASTA grunts]

41
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:56,666
[SEKKE gasps]

42
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,458
[WILLIAM]
He's quick. Fast Movement Magic?

43
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:01,583
[YAMI]
No magical enhancements there.

44
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:04,666
This kid is just
in crazy good shape.

45
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,416
[ASTA yells]

46
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,291
[EXAMINEES gasping]

47
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:17,916
[sputtering]

48
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,208
[ASTA] Unlike you, Sekke, I'm
not joining the Magic Knights

49
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:24,666
just so I can slack off
and have a little fun.

50
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,458
I've got a much bigger goal.

51
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:28,625
I'm gonna be the Wizard King.

52
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:32,166
[WILLIAM]
That grimoire...

53
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,708
Hey.

54
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:40,125
[YUNO] He's not the one who
will defeat you, Asta. I am.

55
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:42,708
Is that a magic sword?

56
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:45,708
So he's not just some
poor reject from the sticks.

57
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:47,083
What's his deal?

58
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:47,958
[TANON]
Who is he?

59
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:48,958
[ASTA grunts]

60
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:50,166
[KOZA]
And that stuff he said...

61
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,375
[GAYAYA]
About the Wizard King...

62
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,250
That's right, you heard me.

63
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:55,791
I'm gonna become the
Wizard King, ya got it?!

64
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:57,250
There a problem with that?!

65
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:58,166
[EXAMINEES laughing, murmuring]

66
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,916
[GAYAYA]
He's officially nuts.

67
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,500
[KOZA]
Him, the Wizard King?

68
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:04,041
Talk about delusions
of grandeur.

69
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:06,250
[SHINANA] He's so out
of touch with reality.

70
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:08,708
I almost feel sorry for the guy.

71
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,666
[BUMODA]
Withdraw already, ya dumb kid!

72
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,916
[ASTA]
Who are you callin' a dumb kid?

73
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,791
Huh. Creation Magic, I'd wager.

74
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,625
[whispering] Impressive moves.

75
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:22,500
Based on the other tests,

76
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:25,958
I would've never expected him
to have that much magic power.

77
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:27,750
Yeah, well... Ha.

78
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:29,333
He didn't use magic power.

79
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:30,791
Huh?

80
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:32,750
[YAMI] I mean, it's not so
much that he didn't use it.

81
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,000
More like he doesn't have it.

82
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:42,500
[YAMI] Matter of fact, I didn't
pick up on any mana before.

83
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:46,250
But he's sayin' he's gonna
be the Wizard King?

84
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,041
Huh.

85
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:51,916
We got ourselves
a real odd duck here.

86
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,416
[WILLIAM]
Hm.

87
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,416

00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:17,458
Wow.

92
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:20,375
Watching nobles fight
is something else.

93
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:22,750
Between their raw power
and their training,

94
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,291
they're unstoppable.

95
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:25,458
[yells]

96
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:32,875

Whoa! So cool!

98
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:42,958
[SHINANA] Seeing the show
these two are putting on

99
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:44,666
makes me think that
runt from before

100
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,208
was nothing to write home about.

101
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:47,750
[BUMODA laughs]
Right?

102
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:50,125
The other guy was
just careless, that's all.

103
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:52,708
[SALIM]
What was your name?

104
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:55,333
Oh, yes. Yuno, was it?

105
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:59,083
Well, looks like you don't
have a sparring partner yet.

106
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:01,791
Perhaps you would like
to take me on, then.

107
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:06,916
[KOZA]
Hey, isn't that...?

108
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,708
[SHINANA]
Yeah, it's Salim.

109
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:11,541
[GAYAYA]
From <i>the</i> Hapshass family.

110
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:15,375
[laughs] You may have been
chosen by the four-leaf clover,

111
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:17,916
but you're still
a mere commoner.

112
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,208
I'll show you just how
superior we nobles are

113
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:23,041
to your kind in rank and power.

114
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:25,500
Oh, and wealth, too, obviously.

115
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:36,458
Now, begin.

116
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:39,875
Having the opportunity to battle
the great Salim de Hapshass.

117
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:42,375
That alone is quite an honor.

118
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:43,958
It will give you
something to talk about

119
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:46,333
when you return to
your little village.

120
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,791
You won't go empty-handed.

121
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:52,791
Take this as a souvenir.

122

Huh.

00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:29,541
[whispering] He's really good.

140
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:31,250
I wonder if he'd like
to be our friend.

141
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:33,125
Wow! A good showing.

142
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:34,208
Yeah.

[WILLIAM]
That concludes the exam.

144
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,250
When your number is called,

145
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:49,041
please step forward
to learn your results.

146
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:51,125
If a captain wants you
on his or her squad,

147
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:54,208
they will raise a hand.
That means you're in.

148
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:55,875
If you do not wish
to join a squad,

149
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:57,625
you may, of course, decline.

150
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:59,875
If you are admitted into
more than one squad,

151
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:03,458
it is up to you to decide
which you will join.

152
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:08,916
However, if no squad wants you,
you will not be a Magic Knight.

153
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,666
In which case,
you must leave at once.

no one wants to touch
a power that mysterious.

People aren't fond
of the unknown.

It boils down to this:

00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,958
what the captains are looking
for here is <i>magic</i> power.

ever want with you?

face the facts.

you're gonna have to prove

can you really say you
have what it takes?

00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:59,375
Then get lost. Go on.

321
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,500
You are not on his level.

322
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:03,666
[whimpers]

323
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,000
[SEKKE]
Right!

324
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:06,666
I just remembered there's
something I have to do.

325
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,708
Be sure to give Asta my
regards, won't you? Ha, ha.

326
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:17,208
Oh, boy! That is so much better!

327
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:19,791
Ah! Everything came
out just fine.

328
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:22,625
Bye-bye, violetsnake.

329
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:25,500
[ASTA, YUNO]
Now, then. Let's go!

330
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:38,583
You got a lotta nerve making
me wait like that, newbie.

331
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:41,000
Just how long was this
dump you took, anyway?

332
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:42,416
[ASTA]
Man, Captain!

333
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,250
You wouldn't believe
it, seriously!

334
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:47,250
Like long. Yeah, and huge, too.

335
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:50,583
That's not what I meant
when I asked how long it was.

336
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:51,791
Like I wanna spend my time

337
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:54,375
chattin' about your
turds, ya moron!

338
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:58,125
[YAMI]
Go on, Finral.

339
00:19:58,208 --> 00:19:59,250
Okay!

340
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:06,791
Whoa! How cool!

341
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:08,750
What is that?

342
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,291
Obviously, you can't
fly on a broom.

343
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:13,916
So, you're gonna have to learn
some kinda transportation spell

344
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,291
to get around.

345
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:17,708
Oh, right! You don't
have any magic power!

346
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:21,166
--[YAMI laughs]
--[ASTA screams]

347
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,750
Um, excuse me, Yami.

348
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:26,708
This is a pretty sizable gate
to keep open for so long.

349
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:28,458
Could you hurry up
and go through already?

350
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:29,916
[FINRAL yelps]

351
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,250
It almost sounded like you
were tellin' me what to do.

352
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:34,666
Suck it up. Dig deep
and push your limits.

353
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,625
[whimpering] Wha...?

354
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:37,791
[YAMI]
In ya go.

355
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:42,083
[ASTA yells]

356
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,041
[GORDON mumbling]
Man, I'm beat.

357
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:47,416
Phew!

358
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,958
Jeez, that hurt.

359
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:50,750
[ASTA gasps]

360
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,541
All right, the
Black Bulls' hideout!

361
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:05,000
Nice, huh? We got
a snazzy place.

362
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,083
[FINRAL]
Mm-hm! Crumbling bricks and all!

363
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,875
[GORDON mumbling]
That's right. Home sweet home.

364
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:12,916
As of today, it's gonna
be my place, too.

365
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:16,208
[ASTA]
All right!

366
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,916
I'm the newest
member of this squad.

367
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,166
Fresh from Hage Village. Asta--

368
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:25,583
[ASTA screams]

369
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:27,541
Aw! Whoops!

370
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:33,791
This is us.

371
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,041
The worst of the worst
Magic Knight squads.

372
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:38,375
Welcome to the Black Bulls.

[SALIM, SEKKE]
"Pump It Up!"

376
00:23:17,708 --> 00:23:19,583
[SALIM]
Let's get this party started!

377
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:22,458
Sekke! That Sekke Magnum
Cannon ball of yours--

378
00:23:22,541 --> 00:23:24,625
could you have chosen
a better name?

379
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:28,375
Ha, ha! And what about your
Holy Lightning Rising Salim?

380
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:31,333
Now that's pure
perfection! Ha, ha!

381
00:23:31,416 --> 00:23:33,166
Sekke,

382
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:36,208
I have a feeling that we're
going to be great friends.

383
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:37,500
[SEKKE]
Hm!

384
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:41,916
[SEKKE, SALIM]
Ha, ha!

385
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,833
Right...

386
00:23:46,166 --> 00:23:47,333
[ASTA]
I did it!

387
00:23:47,416 --> 00:23:50,333
I got a coveted spot on
a Magic Knight Squad!

388
00:23:50,416 --> 00:23:52,791
The only problem is,
it kinda seems like

389
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:54,416
they're a bunch of crazy people.

390
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,958

"The Black Bulls."
