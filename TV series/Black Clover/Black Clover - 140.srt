00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,055
[NARRATOR]
The Clover Kingdom.

2
00:00:24,139 --> 00:00:26,516
In this place where
magic is everything,

3
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:29,477
there lives one boy
who was born without it.

4
00:00:29,561 --> 00:00:31,646
His name is Asta.

5
00:00:33,398 --> 00:00:34,816
[NARRATOR]
His strength and determination

6
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:37,110
helped him become
a Magic Knight.

7
00:00:37,193 --> 00:00:39,779
And despite the many
challenges he faces,

8
00:00:39,863 --> 00:00:43,283
he aims for the top
and refuses to give up!

9
00:00:43,366 --> 00:00:44,993
Rich or poor,

10
00:00:45,076 --> 00:00:47,078
royalty or commoner,

11
00:00:47,162 --> 00:00:49,956
Asta believes anyone can shine.

12
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,043
His mission is to prove
that to the whole world

13
00:00:53,126 --> 00:00:56,004
and to become the
next Wizard King!

14
00:01:01,343 --> 00:01:02,969
Your Majesty!

15
00:01:03,053 --> 00:01:06,723
You know your wandering
privileges are suspended!

16
00:01:06,806 --> 00:01:08,975
[JULIUS] I didn't think you'd
find me if I went this way.

17
00:01:09,059 --> 00:01:10,685
Do you have any
idea how many years

18
00:01:10,769 --> 00:01:12,145
I've been serving you?

19
00:01:12,228 --> 00:01:14,147
Now, please go back to your
office and take care of

20
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:16,358
that mountain of paperwork.

21
00:01:16,441 --> 00:01:18,985
But I already handled
everything for today.

22
00:01:19,069 --> 00:01:19,944
What?

23
00:01:20,028 --> 00:01:21,821
I understand your concern, Marx.

24
00:01:21,905 --> 00:01:24,449
It's important to keep up
with reports and all.

25
00:01:24,532 --> 00:01:26,493
But, to really get
to know my people,

26
00:01:26,576 --> 00:01:28,745
I need to come out
and walk among them!

27
00:01:28,828 --> 00:01:30,538
--[MARX] Please wait!
--[JULIUS gasps]

28
00:01:30,622 --> 00:01:33,541
I wish I could let you go, sir.

29
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:35,460
But with that devil and
Spade threatening us,

30
00:01:35,543 --> 00:01:37,754
the risk is just too great.

31
00:01:37,837 --> 00:01:39,047
Yes, that's true.

32
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:41,132
I still only have a fraction
of my magic power,

33
00:01:41,216 --> 00:01:43,843
so there isn't much
I can do at the moment.

34
00:01:43,927 --> 00:01:46,888
Well then, I have a few
favors to ask of you, Marx.

35
00:01:46,971 --> 00:01:48,765
You're about to be very busy!

36
00:03:22,984 --> 00:03:24,694
[NOELLE]
Okay, Asta, get ready!

37
00:03:24,778 --> 00:03:25,820
[ASTA]
Right!

38
00:03:25,904 --> 00:03:27,030
[NOELLE]
Water Creation Magic:

39
00:03:27,113 --> 00:03:28,615
Sea Dragon's Waterball!

40

[ASTA]
Go, go, go!

41
00:03:33,745 --> 00:03:35,246
[ASTA]
You need to fight harder!

42
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:38,792
You can't hold back just
because this is practice!

43
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:41,753
[NOELLE] All right, fine.
But you better not cry!

44
00:03:41,836 --> 00:03:45,465
[NOELLE] Water Creation Magic:
Sea Dragon's Roar!

45

[ASTA growls, yells]

00:03:52,097 --> 00:03:53,306
[NOELLE gasps]

47
00:03:57,268 --> 00:03:58,687
Train for six months,

48
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:02,565
then we will fight together
to stop Megicula.

49
00:04:02,649 --> 00:04:05,777
We're not there.
We haven't trained enough!

50
00:04:07,737 --> 00:04:09,072
[ASTA grunts]

51
00:04:11,866 --> 00:04:14,577
Aw, you blocked it.
You're no fun.

52
00:04:14,661 --> 00:04:16,871
Huh? Uh, what?

53
00:04:16,955 --> 00:04:17,956
It's Sally!

54
00:04:18,039 --> 00:04:20,959
Good to see you, Asta!
How's it going?

55
00:04:21,042 --> 00:04:22,419
Why are you here?

56
00:04:22,502 --> 00:04:24,254
Don't tell me you escaped.

57
00:04:24,337 --> 00:04:25,630
Nah, I wish!

58
00:04:25,714 --> 00:04:28,550
Mr. Mushroom Head over there
brought me to visit!

59
00:04:28,633 --> 00:04:30,885
I'd prefer it if you
didn't call me that.

60
00:04:30,969 --> 00:04:33,930
[ASTA] Oh, yeah, that's the
Wizard King's assistant!

61
00:04:34,014 --> 00:04:36,057
And, uh, some other guy!

62
00:04:36,141 --> 00:04:38,852
Makusa, from the Magic
Item Research Lab.

63
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:40,895
[NOELLE]
Huh?

64
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:42,981
[ASTA]
You can make magic items?

65
00:04:43,064 --> 00:04:44,274
[MAKUSA]
Yes!

66
00:04:44,357 --> 00:04:45,734
His Majesty was impressed
by Sally's knowledge

67
00:04:45,817 --> 00:04:48,445
of magical science, so he
asked her to invent an item

68
00:04:48,528 --> 00:04:51,573
that would give us an edge in
the battle that's coming up!

69
00:04:51,656 --> 00:04:53,575
I have my reservations, but...

70
00:04:53,658 --> 00:04:54,951
Okay!

71
00:04:55,035 --> 00:04:57,412
First off, I'm gonna need to
get some baseline data,

72
00:04:57,495 --> 00:05:00,123
so I'll just experiment
on the two of you!

73
00:05:00,206 --> 00:05:01,458
In your dreams!

74
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:03,293
Even if you have turned
over a new leaf,

75
00:05:03,376 --> 00:05:06,296
only an idiot would
agree to that!

76
00:05:06,379 --> 00:05:07,672
[ASTA]
Let's go!

77
00:05:07,756 --> 00:05:11,009
Hey! Did you really
have to rip your shirt off?!

78
00:05:11,092 --> 00:05:12,969
I gave you my word.

79
00:05:13,053 --> 00:05:16,514
After the last fight,
I said do what you want to me.

80
00:05:16,598 --> 00:05:20,018
[chuckles] I'm so glad
you remember that.

81
00:05:20,101 --> 00:05:21,227
[ASTA]
Just try not to do anything

82
00:05:21,311 --> 00:05:23,313
that hurts super bad, okay?

83
00:05:23,396 --> 00:05:25,023
So you'll let her take
all your organs as long as

84
00:05:25,106 --> 00:05:28,276
she numbs you first?
You might want to rethink that!

85
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,987
[MAKUSA] Organ removal?
She wouldn't, right?

86
00:05:31,071 --> 00:05:33,323
[MARX] If things get too gory,
we may have to pull the plug

87
00:05:33,406 --> 00:05:35,200
on the whole endeavor.

88
00:05:35,283 --> 00:05:37,577
Now... Let's do it!

89
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,661
[chuckles]

90
00:05:38,745 --> 00:05:40,580
Actually, here's a better idea.

91
00:05:40,663 --> 00:05:43,083
I'm gonna save you
for last, Asta.

92
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:44,668
Huh?

93
00:05:44,751 --> 00:05:47,045
[SALLY] Well, the thing I want
to make is supposed to increase

94
00:05:47,128 --> 00:05:50,465
mana output, and you don't
have any to speak of.

95
00:05:50,548 --> 00:05:53,593
Which means I should
probably start with you!

96
00:05:53,677 --> 00:05:56,554
Look, I don't want anything
to do with this at all.

97
00:05:56,638 --> 00:05:59,724
I'm royalty, and even if I
wasn't, I would still say no!

98
00:05:59,808 --> 00:06:02,352
By the way, are your
squadmates here?

99
00:06:02,435 --> 00:06:04,854
They're out. Assignments
and training and all that.

100
00:06:04,938 --> 00:06:06,523
But most of them should
be back by now.

101
00:06:06,606 --> 00:06:07,732
[GROUP]
Yikes!

102
00:06:07,816 --> 00:06:09,359
Oh. I guess they're here--

103
00:06:09,442 --> 00:06:11,236
Oops, I forgot I have a thing.

104
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:12,737
I should throw this out!

105
00:06:12,821 --> 00:06:14,823
Hey, look at the time!

106
00:06:14,906 --> 00:06:17,325
Lucky me! So many test subjects!

107
00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:18,410
Hey, stop!

108
00:06:18,493 --> 00:06:19,911
Come back!

109
00:06:19,994 --> 00:06:23,123
You need our permission to
do that, and you don't have it!

00:06:23,206 --> 00:06:24,708
Look, the Wizard King!

Listen to me, you two!

just stop her, right now!

Put me down, right now!

You are so dead!

123
00:06:52,277 --> 00:06:54,779
Aw, but when I create
this new magic item,

124
00:06:54,863 --> 00:06:57,032
it's gonna make you a lot
stronger, so don't you think

125
00:06:57,115 --> 00:06:59,534
you should help me
out, Dumbglaspunk?

126
00:06:59,617 --> 00:07:03,079
If you have to insult me, can
you not do it in shorthand?

127
00:07:03,163 --> 00:07:05,457
So Glaspunk uses Flame Magic.

128
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,542
[MAGNA]
Stop making it shorter, dammit!

129
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:10,337
Which means the dark
magic equation should yield

130
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,297
a mana exponent of...

131
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:15,800
Ah! I know the perfect formula!

132
00:07:15,884 --> 00:07:20,013
And now, using Sticky Salamander
as a temporary trial subject...

133
00:07:20,096 --> 00:07:21,639
Observe!

134
00:07:23,516 --> 00:07:25,101
[MAGNA]
Ah? Ah!

135
00:07:25,185 --> 00:07:28,188
[gasps]
What the hell's happening?

136
00:07:28,271 --> 00:07:30,023
There's so much
mana burning inside me,

137
00:07:30,106 --> 00:07:31,483
I feel like I might melt!

138
00:07:31,566 --> 00:07:34,861
I know! Pretty great, huh?

139
00:07:34,944 --> 00:07:36,946
Uh-oh. This is way too much.

140
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,740
Make it stop or I'm gonna...

141
00:07:41,368 --> 00:07:44,245
...blow... a fuse...

142
00:07:44,329 --> 00:07:45,663
[SALLY]
Huh. I'm guessing that means

143
00:07:45,747 --> 00:07:48,208
the dark magic equation
is still incomplete.

144
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:50,919
Maybe the liquid's
too concentrated.

145
00:07:51,002 --> 00:07:52,712
Got some data, though!

146

I don't want anyone
to harm my precious angel!

You do know that's
not her, right, Gauche?

155
00:08:13,066 --> 00:08:14,442
She's made of goo!

[GAUCHE] Goo or no goo,
that's still her face!

Are you ready?

You guys use combination
magic together,

159
00:08:19,948 --> 00:08:22,992
so I wanted to test
you simultaneously!

You're pairing us up?!

00:08:24,119 --> 00:08:25,370
That's so embarrassing!

162
00:08:25,453 --> 00:08:26,913
Marie!

163
00:08:28,915 --> 00:08:30,750
[VANESSA grunts]

164
00:08:30,834 --> 00:08:34,170
[VANESSA] Come on, Vanessa, you
said you'd restrain yourself.

165
00:08:34,254 --> 00:08:37,257
Ah, but this is a rare vintage
I may never see again!

166
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,800
That's obviously a trap.

167
00:08:38,883 --> 00:08:40,427
Can we please get out of here?

168
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:43,847
[SALLY]
Now, the next experiment!

169
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:45,890
[CHARMY]
Ooh!

170
00:08:45,974 --> 00:08:48,059
[CHARMY]
A tempting trail of cupcakes.

171
00:08:48,143 --> 00:08:51,146
Wonder if it leads
to pastry paradise?

172
00:08:51,229 --> 00:08:53,523
[CHARMY chomping]

173
00:08:55,025 --> 00:08:57,152
Too easy!

174
00:08:57,235 --> 00:08:59,195
Say no, Vanessa, you have to!

175
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,698
See? Told you it was a trap.

176
00:09:01,781 --> 00:09:03,575
[NOELLE]
Finral and Vanessa!

177
00:09:03,658 --> 00:09:05,410
[ASTA]
You guys okay?

178
00:09:05,493 --> 00:09:07,454
Yeah. Why, did something happen?

179
00:09:07,537 --> 00:09:08,913
[ROUGE meows]

180
00:09:08,997 --> 00:09:10,957
It looks like
we got here too late.

181
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:13,335
We can't let Sally
hurt anybody else!

Food... Food everywhere...!

00:09:21,009 --> 00:09:23,261
Ugh, none of my tests
have been going the way

185
00:09:23,345 --> 00:09:27,432
that I planned. I need
more data to work with.

186
00:09:27,515 --> 00:09:29,893
--[ASTA] Hold it!
--[SALLY] Uh?

187
00:09:29,976 --> 00:09:31,811
Charmy! Say something!

[CHARMY chuckles]

189
00:09:33,271 --> 00:09:35,315
Asta, what gives?

190
00:09:35,398 --> 00:09:36,775
You're supposed
to be the last one.

191
00:09:36,858 --> 00:09:39,110
Did you get tired of waiting?

192
00:09:39,194 --> 00:09:40,695
--[ASTA growls]
--Hey!

193
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:42,447
I won't go back on my word!

194
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:45,950
You can do what you want to me,
but leave my teammates alone!

195
00:09:46,034 --> 00:09:47,410
You should go back on your word,

196
00:09:47,494 --> 00:09:50,497
otherwise, this lunatic is
gonna chop you to bits!

197
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:53,500
We owe her. She's the reason
we made it to the capital.

198
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:57,754
Because of Sally's group, we
managed to save our friends!

199
00:09:57,837 --> 00:10:00,256
That's why I have
to keep my promise to her!

200
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,467
[SALLY giggles]
Good boy!

201
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,886
It's important to be
a man of your word!

202
00:10:06,554 --> 00:10:09,057
Just please give me
something to knock me out!

203
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:12,352
Oh, this won't hurt
a bit--you'll barely feel it!

204
00:10:12,435 --> 00:10:13,770
Here goes!

205
00:10:13,853 --> 00:10:15,397
[NOELLE]
Asta!

206
00:10:19,442 --> 00:10:21,569
[SALLY giggles]
It's all mine now!

207
00:10:21,653 --> 00:10:23,738
I can culture it later!

208
00:10:23,822 --> 00:10:26,366
What? All you
wanted was my hair?

209
00:10:26,449 --> 00:10:27,283
Weird.

210
00:10:27,367 --> 00:10:28,493
Well, yeah.

211
00:10:28,576 --> 00:10:30,662
Don't you remember
what you said?

212
00:10:30,745 --> 00:10:32,288
That I could experiment
all I wanted,

213
00:10:32,372 --> 00:10:36,001
as long as I didn't
harm anybody.

214
00:10:36,084 --> 00:10:37,252
But in the end,

215
00:10:37,335 --> 00:10:40,130
I guess I did cause them
a lot of distress, huh?

216
00:10:40,213 --> 00:10:41,631
[ASTA chuckles]

217
00:10:41,715 --> 00:10:44,134
[SALLY] Don't worry, they'll
all be back to normal soon.

218
00:10:44,217 --> 00:10:46,261
Their mana just got
cranked up to the max,

219
00:10:46,344 --> 00:10:48,346
and their bodies
kinda shut down.

220
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,764
Wow, Sally.

221
00:10:49,848 --> 00:10:52,684
Crazy or not, you still kept up
your end of the deal!

222
00:10:52,767 --> 00:10:54,394
Actually, you know something?

223
00:10:54,477 --> 00:10:56,646
I don't think I can get by
with just your hair.

224
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,732
How 'bout some
nail clippings, too?

225
00:10:58,815 --> 00:11:00,066
Sure, I don't mind!

226
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,485
[NOELLE] That's not how
you clip someone's nails!

227
00:11:02,569 --> 00:11:05,780
While I'm at it, do you
mind if I draw your blood?

228
00:11:05,864 --> 00:11:07,532
It's all in the name of science.

229
00:11:07,615 --> 00:11:10,660
And I might as well take your
heart, lungs, and eyeballs, too!

230
00:11:10,744 --> 00:11:12,871
Take the hair and get lost!

231
00:11:12,954 --> 00:11:14,080
Test away!

232
00:11:14,164 --> 00:11:16,916
If your research helps
people, I'm all for it!

233
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,543
[SALLY]
Ah...?

234
00:11:21,421 --> 00:11:22,630
That was rough.

235
00:11:22,714 --> 00:11:24,257
I'm so glad it's over now.

236
00:11:24,341 --> 00:11:25,717
Time for a little payback!

237
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,802
You sick freak!

238
00:11:27,886 --> 00:11:29,054
Calm down, guys.

Everyone's better now--
let's just move past it!

240
00:11:32,015 --> 00:11:33,975
As for the data
that was gathered...

241
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:35,393
Wow!

242
00:11:35,477 --> 00:11:38,271
I don't understand this at all,
but it's fascinating!

243
00:11:38,355 --> 00:11:41,274
Makusa will investigate
these findings at the lab.

244
00:11:41,358 --> 00:11:43,693
After that, the magic item
will be created.

245
00:11:43,777 --> 00:11:45,278
Do your best, science guy!

246
00:11:45,362 --> 00:11:47,072
And you work hard too, Sally!

247
00:11:47,155 --> 00:11:48,573
[SALLY]
Okay!

248
00:11:48,656 --> 00:11:49,741
[MAKUSA]
We've got this!

249
00:11:49,824 --> 00:11:52,494
Well, at least
they got some solid data.

250
00:11:52,577 --> 00:11:54,412
Let's hope that
it does some good.

251

[CHARMY, GREY]
Mm, mm!

252
00:11:55,663 --> 00:11:57,290
You better not screw this up!

253
00:11:57,374 --> 00:11:59,417
If you do, then you're dead.

254

[SALLY gasps]

255
00:12:01,711 --> 00:12:02,962
What are you waiting for?

256
00:12:03,046 --> 00:12:05,048
Use your Spatial Magic
and send them on their way.

257
00:12:05,131 --> 00:12:06,675
Uh, right.

258
00:12:06,758 --> 00:12:08,802
[FINRAL]
Why's she bossing me around?

259
00:12:08,885 --> 00:12:10,387
[MARX]
Let's head back, Sally.

260
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:11,888
[SALLY]
Coming!

261
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,810
[SALLY]
Research that helps people, huh?

262
00:12:16,893 --> 00:12:18,561
Maybe he's onto something.

263
00:12:18,645 --> 00:12:21,981
Good luck! See ya soon!

264
00:12:22,065 --> 00:12:24,317
I hope you're right, Asta!

265
00:12:36,579 --> 00:12:39,290
We're close to Arandom Village.

266
00:12:39,374 --> 00:12:41,876
It's odd that you and I
were sent together,

267
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,879
since we're captains
of two different squads.

268
00:12:44,963 --> 00:12:46,923
I don't care how strange it is.

269
00:12:47,007 --> 00:12:49,634
My goal is to find anyone
who dares threaten our kingdom

270
00:12:49,718 --> 00:12:51,636
and strike them down.

271
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,514
[MARX] What could've caused
the crisis in this village?

272
00:12:57,684 --> 00:12:59,102
Your Majesty.

273
00:12:59,185 --> 00:13:01,688
I've brought the two Magic
Knight Captains you called for.

274
00:13:01,771 --> 00:13:03,356
Sorry to take you
away from your squads

275
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,066
when you're so busy.

276
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:05,984
No.

277
00:13:06,067 --> 00:13:07,986
It's fine. What's wrong, sir?

278
00:13:08,069 --> 00:13:09,654
Have either of you
heard tell of a place

279
00:13:09,738 --> 00:13:13,408
called Arandom Village?
It's in the Forsaken Realm.

280
00:13:13,491 --> 00:13:15,243
I happened upon it while
I was out wandering--

281
00:13:15,326 --> 00:13:17,996
er, I mean investigating
different areas

282
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:19,497
of the Clover Kingdom.

283
00:13:19,581 --> 00:13:22,208
According to several reports,
Arandom Village has begun

284
00:13:22,292 --> 00:13:24,586
to suffer from a bandit
problem recently.

285
00:13:24,669 --> 00:13:26,880
Then we should send a team
there to deal with them.

286
00:13:26,963 --> 00:13:29,674
No, that won't be
enough to solve this.

287
00:13:29,758 --> 00:13:31,718
I'm not sure why, but I have
a feeling that something

288
00:13:31,801 --> 00:13:36,139
unfavorable is going on.
The only question is what.

289
00:13:36,222 --> 00:13:38,266
[NOZEL]
Something unfavorable?

290
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,601
[FUEGOLEON]
Sounds ominous.

291
00:13:39,684 --> 00:13:41,227
That's where you two come in.

292
00:13:41,311 --> 00:13:43,938
You'll disguise yourselves
and mingle with the villagers.

293
00:13:44,022 --> 00:13:45,648
Perhaps that way, you'll
learn something useful

294
00:13:45,732 --> 00:13:47,067
about the bandits.

295
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,736
It's an undercover
investigation!

296
00:13:49,819 --> 00:13:52,697
[MARX] Sounds like
he's thought this through.

297
00:13:52,781 --> 00:13:55,158
Are these really our disguises?!

298
00:13:55,241 --> 00:13:56,701
[MARX]
Listen, I hate to criticize,

299
00:13:56,785 --> 00:14:00,205
but this only makes us
look more suspicious.

300
00:14:00,288 --> 00:14:02,290
These outfits are our only hope.

301
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:04,334
We don't know how to conduct
ourselves like commoners,

302
00:14:04,417 --> 00:14:07,504
so our best strategy is to hide
our appearance altogether.

303
00:14:07,587 --> 00:14:10,340
Some nobles do forsake
their lives of luxury.

304
00:14:10,423 --> 00:14:13,051
Perhaps people will assume
that's the case with us.

305
00:14:13,134 --> 00:14:14,928
Right. That makes sense.

306
00:14:15,011 --> 00:14:18,098
Anyway, where should we
begin gathering intel?

307
00:14:18,181 --> 00:14:20,975
[NOZEL] The village square's
as good a place as any.

308
00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:22,227
Perfectly sound.

309
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:24,229
And lest we forget,
the Wizard King said

310
00:14:24,312 --> 00:14:26,314
we're supposed to act casual.

311
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:28,525
So let's do our
best to blend in.

312
00:14:30,276 --> 00:14:32,904
[MARX] Blending in
isn't their strong suit.

313
00:14:32,987 --> 00:14:35,657
Maybe if they could relax,
we'd be able to pull it off.

314
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:38,743
But I mustn't
overstep my station.

315
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:47,836
[MARX]
What happened here?

316
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:50,255
We knew there were areas
that hadn't been restored yet,

317
00:14:50,338 --> 00:14:52,424

00:21:05,213 --> 00:21:07,048
But it seems that
we weren't entirely aware

476
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:09,009
of your situation.

477
00:21:09,092 --> 00:21:11,094
We're going to make
even greater strides to restore

478
00:21:11,177 --> 00:21:13,555
this kingdom, so please
have faith in us.

479
00:21:13,638 --> 00:21:14,889
[sobbing]

480
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:17,017
[MAYER]
Thank you so much!

481
00:21:18,309 --> 00:21:19,769
[NOZEL] That's everything
we have to report from

482
00:21:19,853 --> 00:21:21,896
our time in Arandom.

483
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,148
Great job, Captains.

484
00:21:23,231 --> 00:21:25,150
Seems like you
made the right choice.

485
00:21:25,233 --> 00:21:28,028
We've sent some knights
to the other villages.

486
00:21:28,111 --> 00:21:30,780
That way, we can determine
what sort of aid each one needs,

487
00:21:30,864 --> 00:21:32,282
and how much.

488
00:21:32,365 --> 00:21:35,410
[JULIUS] Hmm. As Wizard King,
my job, and yours as well,

489
00:21:35,493 --> 00:21:37,162
is to ensure that all
of our people can

490
00:21:37,245 --> 00:21:39,164
live safely and peacefully.

491
00:21:39,247 --> 00:21:41,416
And now that you've spent
some time with them,

492
00:21:41,499 --> 00:21:43,168
perhaps you've learned
to see their situation

493
00:21:43,251 --> 00:21:45,086
in a new light?

494
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:46,338
[NOZEL]
Of course.

495
00:21:46,421 --> 00:21:47,964
[FUEGOLEON]
That's why he sent us.

496
00:21:48,048 --> 00:21:51,801
Captains, from now on,
I want you to work even harder,

497
00:21:51,885 --> 00:21:54,929
to lead the Magic Knights
and protect this kingdom!

498
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:56,848
[BOTH]
Yes, Your Majesty!

499
00:21:56,931 --> 00:21:59,142
[JULIUS]
Hmm. Don't let me down.

500
00:22:03,605 --> 00:22:05,148
Now that that's taken care of,

501
00:22:05,231 --> 00:22:07,233
I think I'll wander
around by myself.

502
00:22:07,317 --> 00:22:08,485
Certainly not.

503
00:22:08,568 --> 00:22:11,946
No? Well. Then I suppose
I'll check in with Yami.

504
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,698
I'll tell you, Marx,
all this sitting around

505
00:22:13,782 --> 00:22:15,533
is driving me batty.

506
00:22:15,617 --> 00:22:17,744
[MARX sighs]

507
00:22:17,827 --> 00:22:20,538
[MARX] I know you feel
useless, but right now,

508
00:22:20,622 --> 00:22:23,750
the Clover Kingdom needs
you more than you realize.

509
00:23:56,968 --> 00:23:59,679
[NARRATOR] Since his squadmates
are mostly royals and nobles,

510
00:23:59,763 --> 00:24:01,973
Yuno struggles to
find common ground.

511
00:24:02,057 --> 00:24:05,769
<i>Black Clover</i> , Page 141:
"The Golden Family."

512
00:24:05,852 --> 00:24:07,145
Just like Asta,

513
00:24:07,228 --> 00:24:09,856
Yuno also possesses
the magic of never giving up.
