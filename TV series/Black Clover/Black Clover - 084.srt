humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

took up the fight.

After his triumph, he was hailed

I'm certain she'll be overjoyed
and beaming with pride.

Indeed, Master.

gotta win this!

You are the illustrious

Show no mercy in proving
that to the enemy.

It's the final match and he's
still cool as a cucumber.

00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:26,583
I guess that's typical
for Captain Rill, though.

just the way we planned it!

He sure knows his way
around Wind Magic spells!

195
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,333
He does have a four-leaf
clover grimoire, after all.

00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:16,791
Impressive!

197
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:20,250
Yes, but, he's fighting the
captain of the Aqua Deer,

198
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,916
who's got quite an
artful defense strategy.

Still, though.

203
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,375
I don't think you've
given me enough inspiration

204
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,166
to paint my greatest
masterpiece yet,

205
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,583
so let's keep going!

206

What's this jerk's problem?

207
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:40,500
Using his weird art projects
to block everything?

208

[YUNO]
Bell. It's time.

[BELL squeals]

210
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:52,958
I'd been saving this to use
against Asta during the finals,

211
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:55,750
but he's a Magic Knight captain,

212
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,250
so he's worthy!

213
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:01,666
[NARRATOR] Yuno had once
controlled his mana

214
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,500
using the heightened
focus he'd developed

215
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:06,666
during a battle in which he was
deprived of all five senses.

216
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,291
After that, with his
training using Mana Skin

217
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,458
to envelop himself in
a protective barrier,

218
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:13,333
the young Magic Knight
was able to master

219
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:16,583
a method of gathering enormous
amounts of mana inside his body.

220
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:19,041
Then, he honed this
skill even further,

221
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:21,041
to the point that he finally
learned how to harness

222
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:24,291
not only his own mana,
but the spirit's power as well!

00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:30,541
Thanks for your help, Walt.

325
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,458
And, Yuno.

326
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:33,625
Thank you.

327
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:36,833
Ahh! Sweet, sweet victory!

328
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:39,333
--Noelle. That was great.
--We flexed our mushles!

329
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:41,333
--Of course. What'd you expect?
--[MUSHROOM yells]

330
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:43,666
[NOELLE squeals]
Oh, my gosh, I can't believe

331
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,166
we actually did it!

332
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:51,125
[JULIUS] The Royal Knights
Selection Exam is now over.

333
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:52,458
Good work, Team P.

334
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:54,375
My congratulations.

335
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,666
And regardless of the result,

336
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,166
you all should be proud of
winning the semifinal.

337

--[RILL laughs]
--[RUBEN, NILS groan]

338
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,250
Oh, and just because the
other teams were eliminated

339
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:06,541
along the way,

340
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,791
that doesn't mean anyone's
out of the running.

341
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:11,000
We're going to give each
individual contestant's

342
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:13,208
performance a
comprehensive review,

343
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:15,541
and then we'll select
10 to 20 Royal Knights

344
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,208
at a later date.

345
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:18,416
[MAGIC KNIGHTS gasps]

346
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,958
Awesome, that means
I've still got a shot!

347
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:22,041
[JULIUS]
Everyone here is a

348
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:24,375
remarkably talented
Magic Knight.

349
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:27,625
It won't be an easy decision,
that's for sure.

350
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:30,625
[JULIUS] In closing, we have a
special message from the king.

351
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:31,500
[MAGIC KNIGHTS gasp]

352
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,250
Ahem!

353
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:35,708
You all have done
exceedingly well.

354
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:37,833
Exchanging sophisticated spells,

355
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:40,125
your uncanny ability
to adapt and innovate

356
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:41,791
in a variety of situations,

357
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:43,791
and, of course,
your keen execution

358
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,625
of precise battle strategies.

359
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:46,833
Really, any team here

360
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,291
could have been the one
to emerge victorious

361
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:49,583
from where I'm sitting!

362
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:51,291
[LEOPOLD]
He sounds like a real king.

363
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:52,375
[MAGIC KNIGHT 84A]
So proper!

364
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:53,750
[MAGIC KNIGHT 84B]
Maybe too proper.

365
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,708
[MAGIC KNIGHT 84C] This doesn't
seem right, somehow.

366
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:56,833
However!

367
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:58,875
I still worked harder
than any of you!

368
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,208
[MAGIC KNIGHTS]
Uh...

369
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:01,708
If not for me, then there
would be no tournament!

370
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:03,208
I was the one who announced that

371
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:05,750
the strongest would be selected
to join the Royal Knights!

372
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:08,750
I am singlehandedly responsible
for this whole event!

373
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:09,958
What are you waiting for?!

374
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:11,916
Shower me with praise!

375
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,208
[MAGIC KNIGHTS]
Uh...

376
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:16,708
Thank you, Your Majesty,
but please relax.

377
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:18,541
We're all here because
we heartily endorse

378
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:19,916
the appointment of
the Royal Knights

379
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,625
and eagerly await
the announcement.

380
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,458
Look. Think about it this way.

381
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:25,125
These warriors are
devoting themselves

382
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:27,125
to defeating the
Eye of the Midnight Sun,

383
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:30,291
and isn't that far more
rewarding than any praise?

384
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:31,708
[KING CLOVER groans]

385
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:33,666
[MAGIC KNIGHT 84A] The Wizard
King is so much better.

386
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,958
[MAGIC KNIGHT 84B] If only
he was the one ruling us.

387
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:39,250
[MAGIC KNIGHT 84C] Can't we just
make him the king from now on?

388
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,833
Now then. Whoever makes it
into the Royal Knights,

389
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:43,333
I'll be counting on you!

390
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,166
[MAGIC KNIGHTS]
Sir!

391
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,625
[KING CLOVER]
Curse you, Julius!

You're always hogging
the spotlight!

Well, that's that.

397
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:59,000
I'd say today's contest
was a success.

398
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:00,000
Indeed.

399
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:02,208
It fulfilled your
other goal, too.

400
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:04,250
We've potentially discovered
the Magic Knight

401
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:07,583
being used as a puppet by
the Eye of the Midnight Sun.

402
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,458
[MARX]
As soon as Langris recovers,

403
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:12,750
we'll conduct a
full investigation.

404
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:16,208
[JULIUS] I don't want to
make everyone a suspect,

405
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:18,333
but there may be more to come.

406
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,541
We can't let our guard down.

407
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:26,250
[ASTA] Thanks for
staying with me, Mimosa.

408
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:27,791
Yes, of course.

409
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:30,666
[MIMOSA] My magic may be able
to heal wounds of the body,

410
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,333
but ones of the spirit...

Ready? We're leaving.

[CHARMY]
Yuno!

415
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,625
What? Now?

416
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:42,375
[KLAUS]
I see. Asta.

417
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:43,625
[NOELLE]
You've done enough.

418
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:45,458
I can look after him now.

419
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:47,458
Um, I mean, don't
take it the wrong way.

420
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:49,083
Squadmates are supposed
to help each other.

421
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,166
That's all I'm talking about.

422
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:58,041
Yuno?

423
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:00,625
You don't want to say
goodbye, at least?

424
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,125
[ASTA]
Yuno!

425
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:05,166
I will catch up to you.

426
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,000
I will be the Wizard King.

427
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,500
I swear!

428
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,208
I don't feel like
being caught up to.

My prince.

431
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:27,583
[ZORA]
You made this?

432
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:29,833
Sure, he may be a little
rough around the edges,

433
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:32,083
but the important thing is
that he's a man of his word--

434
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,708
a warrior who's secretly
protecting his country.

435
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:36,791
We trust each other
like lifelong friends

436
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:39,500
and face death
together every day.

437
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:41,916
[ZORA]
Friends. Trust.

438
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,291
[chuckles] Now those aren't
things I think about too often.

439
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:48,125
[JULIUS]
Leaving already?

440
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:49,666
[ZORA gasps]

441
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,416
[JULIUS] Thank you for telling
those who lost their battles

442
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,583
where they went wrong.

443
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:56,125
While I can't applaud the
manner in which you did,

444
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:57,625
I'm certain those
who wish to grow

445
00:21:57,708 --> 00:22:01,166
will heed your advice
and be stronger for it.

446
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:05,083
We need your Trap Magic and your
ability to think critically.

447
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:07,708
The exam is done,
and you likely passed.

448
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:09,125
I hope you'll join.

449
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:11,125
[ZORA sighs]

450
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:12,958
[ZORA]
What are you talkin' about?

451
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:15,291
I might've kept the
rest of 'em guessing,

452
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:16,833
but smart money
says you've known

453
00:22:16,916 --> 00:22:20,041
since this whole thing started
that I wasn't Xerx Lugner.

454
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:20,875
See ya.

455
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:22,208
[JULIUS]
Quite right.

456
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:25,291
I'm not pleased that you
impersonated someone else.

457
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:27,916
But, since you are
a Magic Knight,

458
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,791
you're still qualified...

459
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:31,291
...Zora.

460
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:35,333
I met a certain Purple Orca
on the battlefield long ago.

461
00:22:35,416 --> 00:22:38,958
His name was Zara Ideale.

462
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:42,208
He did everything in his power
to keep his kingdom safe.

463
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:44,625
The very model
of a Magic Knight.

464
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:47,958
[ZARA] I fought alongside
a real tough character

465
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:49,375
on the battlefield today.

466
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:52,291
He definitely knew impressive
ways to use Time Magic.

467
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:55,583
The guy's on his way to
the top, that's for sure.

468
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:57,541
Novachrono, I think?

469
00:22:57,625 --> 00:23:00,333
Ha, ha! Even his name is cool!

470
00:23:00,416 --> 00:23:03,208
To ensure commoners like
him were acknowledged,

471
00:23:03,291 --> 00:23:05,333
I developed a system
that awards knights

472
00:23:05,416 --> 00:23:08,541
based on their merit
instead of their status.

473
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:10,625
Yet there are still those
among the Magic Knights

474
00:23:10,708 --> 00:23:12,791
who could learn from
a man like that.

475
00:23:12,875 --> 00:23:15,166
Isn't it time that
you wore your robe?

476
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,583
The robe of your true squad.

477
00:23:17,666 --> 00:23:19,500
Zora Ideale.

478
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:22,750
[ZORA sighs]

479
00:23:27,125 --> 00:23:29,416
[ZORA] Don't know who
you're talkin' about.

480
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:34,291
[ZORA]
Me?

481

at your service.

What incredible
beauty lies ahead

continues to unfold?
