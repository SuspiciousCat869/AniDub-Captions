00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:15,666
[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,541
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,625
[NARRATOR] All seemed lost
until a lone mage

4
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:27,458
stepped forward and
took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:35,625
[NARRATOR]
After his triumph, he was hailed

6
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:39,791
as the Wizard King,
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:50,333
C'mon, Sister. Stay with us!

8
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:52,625
[grunting]

00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:56,500
[GAUCHE grunting]

10
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:58,583
Old hag. Wake up!

11
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:00,625
You can't die on me.

12
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:05,541
If you keeled over now,
Marie would be sad.

13
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:09,458
And I... wouldn't be too
happy about it, either.

14
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:14,625
Take... Take care
of them. The children.

15
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:16,583
It's always the same.

16
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:19,500
No matter who wins,
on any battlefield,

17
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:22,125
it's the weak who pay
the greatest price.

18
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:26,083
Children are innocent,
untouched by sin.

19
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:29,500
They were the ones
I most wanted to protect.

20
00:01:29,583 --> 00:01:32,375
And so I left the
battlefield behind,

21
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:35,250
and devoted myself
to the church.

22
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:36,958
Sister!

23
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:40,083
What kind of nonsense is that?

24
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:41,583
No one is pure.

25
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:44,375
You're all tainted by sin
from the moment of your birth.

26
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:46,583
You're insane.

27
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:49,458

29
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:53,333
Just look at you, Sally.

30
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:57,250
Poor thing. They've
hurt you so badly.

31
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:59,500
I tried, Master.

32
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:02,666
You did well, but now
it's time for you to rest.

33
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:03,500
Valtos?

34
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:04,875
Yes, sir.

35
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,458
[SALLY]
Bye, Asta. Catch you later.

36
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:17,000
Don't forget, precious,
you belong to me.

37
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:19,458
[ASTA]
Please just leave me alone.

38
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:21,125
I'm to blame for this.

39
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:24,041
I should never have sent
her here by herself.

40
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:27,500
This outcome was... unexpected.

41
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:30,583
[LICHT] You needn't feel
responsible for what happened.

42
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:32,375
We all know how they fight.

43
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:35,125
No doubt they resorted
to underhanded tactics.

44
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:37,208
You're saying that
<i>we</i> fight dirty?

45
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:41,333
After what that crazy lackey
of yours did to those poor kids?

46
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:45,083
You know, the sister
was wrong before.

47
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:47,541
It isn't the weak who pay.

48
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,083
Not at all.

49
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:52,833
It is the strong who
have been victimized.

50
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:59,250
Envied, feared, discriminated
against, persecuted,

51
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:01,416
and stolen from.

52
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,416
[ASTA] What's he talking
about? That's crazy.

53
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,083
[LICHT]
For its crimes.

54
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:09,291
The Clover Kingdom
cannot be forgiven.

55
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:12,958
Instead, we will destroy you
as you so richly deserve,

56
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:14,875
and build a nation of our own.

57
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:18,166
Where do you get off acting like
we're the bad guys here?

58
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,958
You and your group of
psychos started all this.

59
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:23,250
You jerk!

60
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:26,083
[ASTA screams]

61
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:29,916
I refuse to listen
to that kind of filth.

62
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,583
It's painful, really.

63
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:36,000
Seeing someone as disgusting
as you with that grimoire.

64
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,375
[ASTA]
My grimoire?

65
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:41,458
Never mind, I need to stay
focused on his attacks.

66
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:44,416
They come so fast,
I can't even see them.

67
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,916
What do I do?

68
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,041
[gasps]

69
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:49,041
[ASTA]
The only thing I can do;

70
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:52,625
use my sword as a shield
to block any fatal blows.

71
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:56,041
[ASTA yells]
I'm not done!

72
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:57,750
Yes, you are.

73
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:59,125
[ASTA gasps]

74
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:03,416
I'll just be taking that
grimoire back from you now.

75
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,916
[ASTA]
This is it.

76
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:07,458
[ASTA]
I'm dead--

77
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,333
[gasps]

78
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,833
No way.

79
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:19,083
Captain Yami?!
What are you doing here?

80
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:25,208
Why am I here? Well, hell, kid.

81
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:27,333
I guess I musta gotten lost.

82
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:30,166
Anybody know where the bar is?

83
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,041
Really?! You were
looking for a bar?

84
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,541
[YAMI]
Huh?

85
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:10,291
Jeez, you got rocks in
there instead of brains?

86
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:12,416
That's what people call a joke.

87
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,000
What?!

88
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:16,166
I'm a Magic Knight,
and there's trouble.

89
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,541
That's what I'm
doing here, idiot.

90
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:21,166
We heard about
what was going on,

91
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,166
but everyone back at the
hideout was useless as usual,

92
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,375
so here I am. I'll
kill 'em all later.

93
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:30,583
[ASTA] They couldn't pull
it together this once?

94
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:32,166
[FINRAL]
This is why we're here?

95
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,375
I wish he'd just let me sleep!

96
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:36,083
What the hell're
you doing, anyway?

97
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:38,125
I gave all you
knuckleheads the day off.

98
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:40,833
Maybe what you need is
a more permanent vacation.

99
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:46,125
[ASTA yelps, whimpers]

100
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:48,541
So, what's up with this guy?

101
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:49,666
He says he's the leader

102
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,791
of the Eye of the
Midnight Sun, sir.

103
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:53,791
N-No way, not them again!

104
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:56,000
Oh, yeah?

105
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,250
Here I'd been picturing
a super buff guy

106
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:03,958
who ate cows whole or somethin'.
Not some scrawny freak.

107
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:07,208
[FINRAL] Not everything in
this world is about muscles.

108
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:08,458
This guy has magic power

109
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:11,875
practically pouring out
of him. It's bottomless!

110
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:14,750
And Light Magic?
That's super rare stuff.

111
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:16,208
Only a few people
in the whole history

112
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:19,291
of the Clover Kingdom
have ever wielded it.

113
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:22,083
Whatever happens next,
it isn't gonna be pretty.

114
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:24,916
I wanna go home!

115
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,791
So, the Black Bulls
captain came himself.

116
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:29,833
Shall I summon
the Third Eye now?

117
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,041
No need. You see,
the captain here

118
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:33,750
is a wielder of Dark Magic.

119
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:38,000
I'll enjoy pitting my power
against his in battle.

120
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:41,000
Hey, Finral. Can you get
the others to the village?

121
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:44,291
Sure, leave it to me.
But, what about you?

122
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:49,333
I can still fight!

123
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:52,000
[ASTA] This is my chance to
see Captain Yami in action.

124
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:55,083
No way am I leaving now.

125
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:57,541
[FINRAL] Gauche and,
well, whoever you are.

126
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:58,625
Can you walk?

127
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:00,791
See to the old hag
first! And hurry!

128
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,708
[FINRAL]
Right, got it!

129
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:06,375
[FINRAL] Never mind that
I'm actually your superior.

130
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:09,708
All right, Captain.
It's up to you now.

131
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:12,250
[YAMI]
Hey. You better be comin' back.

132
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:15,250
[FINRAL] Ugh! Did he know
I was planning to sneak off?

133
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,125
He couldn't, right?

134
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:18,416
Well, y'know.

135
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,333
I think I might be a
little low on mana, so...

136
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:22,583
Really! I'm not kidding!

137
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,458
[YAMI]
Yeah? Look at my face.

138
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:26,041
Does it look like I'm kidding?

139
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:29,666
[FINRAL laughs nervously]
No, sir. I guess it doesn't.

140
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:36,125
Are you tryin' to mess up
my ride or somethin'?

141
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:39,750
[FINRAL] His ride? All right,
time to get out of here.

142
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:42,416
I'm not looking to die today.

143
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,958
[FINRAL] I'm off! Gotta get
these people to safety.

144
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:47,333
You better be comin' back,
you hear me, Finral?

145
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:48,833
So cool!

146
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:51,166
How'd you know that
strike was coming?

147
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,041
What kinda sword is that?
Where'd you get it?

148
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:54,916
[YAMI]
Shut up, wouldja?

149
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:57,500
[YAMI]
This is a katana.

150
00:08:57,583 --> 00:09:00,041
It's from my native country,
the Land of the Sun.

151
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,416
I blocked his hit by--

152
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,833
Ah, never mind.
No time to explain.

153
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:06,958
Besides, it's boring
that way. Just watch.

154
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:11,416
[LICHT] Engage Light Magic:
Light Swords of Conviction.

155
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,916
Awesome!

156
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,291
[LICHT] He's using
Reinforcement Magic to boost

157
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,750
his natural abilities
and cloaking his sword

158
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:23,958
in Dark Magic to
slice through my spell.

159
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:29,625
[LICHT] Except, there's
more to it than that.

160
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:32,791
Very well. Let's try
something else, then.

161
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:39,250
Impressive.

162
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:42,333
The power of an unorthodox
Grand Magic Knight.

163
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,375
Hold on. You know,

164
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:47,166
I think I recognize you
from somewhere.

165
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:54,916
[YAMI] Except I'm pretty
sure I'd remember

166
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
if I knew somebody who
could use Light Magic.

167
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:03,416
So who are you,
and what's your angle?

168
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,625
Do you go around attacking
people just for kicks?

169
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:16,750
[LICHT] My angle?
Let me tell you a story.

170
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:20,666
[LICHT] Once upon a time,
in a certain village,

171
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,916
there lived people who had
tremendous magic power.

172
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,250
They were special.

173
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,500
Greatly loved by the
mana of this world.

174
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,916
They could control
weather at will.

175
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
And manipulate the minerals.

176
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:35,791
Their powers were truly godlike.

177
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:38,916
[LICHT] Indeed, those
outside their village

178
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,708
came to revere them
as divine beings.

179
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:46,291
But then, the people's
feelings began to change.

180
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:50,708
Their respect and admiration
became fear and envy.

181
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:52,833
They slaughtered their
gods in a cowardly

182
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:57,375
surprise attack,
and stole their power.

183
00:10:57,458 --> 00:11:00,750
What kinda story
is that? Who cares?

184
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:04,791
[YAMI]
You plannin' to become a bard?

185
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:12,708
Well, I got a story of my own
you might like to hear.

186
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:14,916
There once was a young
man with a bright mind

187
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,750
and a pure heart.
His father was a fisherman

188
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:21,125
who sent him out to work
the sea at a young age.

189
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:25,958
Then, one day,
his boat got wrecked.

190
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:27,708
[YAMI yelling]

191
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,333
[YAMI]
Seriously?

192
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:33,000
[YAMI] He fell into
the water and washed up

193
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:35,375
on an unknown shore.

194
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:38,041
[VILLAGER 34A]
Who is this kid?

195
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,166
[VILLAGER 34B]
He's wearing grass sandals!

196
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,083
[VILLAGERS laughing]

197
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:44,333
[YAMI] He looked and acted
different than the people there,

198
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:47,291
so he got the crap
beat out of him a lot.

199
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:48,958
But that was okay.

200
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,333
[YAMI laughing]

201
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:52,791
[YAMI] 'Cause he turned
around and beat the crap

202
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:55,708
out of them and then became
a badass squad boss.

203
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:57,208
The end!

204
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:04,750
Well? I think it's
a pretty good story.

205
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:07,458
'Course, it is half
my life, so there's that.

206
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:09,958
Silence! How dare you
mock Master Licht?

207
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:11,125
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

208
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:13,291
That is one seriously
freaky face.

209
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:15,333
What are those weird
lookin' lines for?

210
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:17,416
Now's not really the time!

211
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,333
[YAMI yells]

212
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:21,500
[YAMI]
He's gotten faster.

213
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:23,166
If you're truly a foreigner,

214
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,791
then my tale has
nothing to do with you.

215
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:28,333
In which case,
feel free to leave.

216
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,750
Captain Yami!

217
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,291
You've avoided mortal blows,

218
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:39,000
but how much longer
will your luck hold?

219
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:43,208
Are you the guy who
messed up Fuegoleon so bad?

220
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:44,500
Huh?

221
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:46,833
That's right.

222
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:48,458
[ASTA gasps]

223
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:51,208
I prepared so very carefully,

224
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:53,708
and he walked
right into my trap.

225
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,500
Figured as much.

226
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:59,666
These little darts wouldn't
do anything to a guy like him.

227
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,666
He'd take you down.

228
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:07,583
[grunting]

229
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:42,916
[YAMI growls]

230
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:59,458
Now, Dark Magic: Dark Cloaked...

231
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:02,833
[YAMI]
...Lightless Slash!

232
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:05,666
Master Licht!

233
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,916
[ASTA]
That was amazing!

234
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,458
I've never seen
anything like it before!

235
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:12,541
[YAMI]
Of course you used a trap.

236
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:14,958
You couldn't win
unless you played dirty.

237
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:16,833
Why, you--!

238
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:20,500
Stop dancin' around
and come at me head-on.

239
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:23,041
I'll show you what
a squad captain can do.

240
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,125
Think you can handle it?

241
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,000
[YAMI]
Hey, kid! Were you watching?

242
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:38,875
Uh, yes, sir?

243
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:41,250
[YAMI] That's good.
Because now it's your turn.

244
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:42,875
Yes, sir!

245
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:44,708
Wait, what did you say?

246
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:46,500
There's no way I can do that!

247
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:50,625
Yeah? Last I checked,
I was still your captain.

248
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:54,166
Which means, if I tell you
to do something, you do it.

249
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,041
Assuming you wanna be a
real man someday, Shrimpsta.

250
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,625
[ASTA]
Please, sir. That really hurts!

251
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:01,625
[VALTOS] He blocked
Master Licht's attacks

252
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:05,125
and even managed to fight back.

253
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:07,583
The Captain of the Black Bulls.

254
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:11,416
Could his power possibly
rival the Wizard King's?

255
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:16,750
Fascinating. The power
of Dark Magic.

256
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,333
Now, Light Recovery Magic:

257
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:22,541
Healing Light Particles.

258
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,458
Come on! Really?

259
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:28,625
He can use Recovery Magic, too?

260
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:30,875
[YAMI]
I haven't seen it much myself,

261
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:33,291
but apparently, some people
who've got a lot of mana

262
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:36,083
can wield all kinds
of different magic.

263
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:38,333
It's especially rare for
attack types like him

264
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:41,333
to be able to heal, too.

265
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:44,208
Never mind that for now.
You ready to go?

266
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:46,125
[ASTA]
He was serious?!

267
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:48,083
Please, sir! This is impossible.

268
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:50,041
I can't do what you just did.

269
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,416
You remember I can't
use magic, right?

270
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,541
I'm not talkin' about
that last attack, moron.

271
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:57,041
I mean this move
here where I block

272
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:59,083
his stupid little
lightning bolts. See?

273
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,125
[ASTA]
How do I hit something

274
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,250
if I don't even know it's there?

275
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:04,208
Guess I've got no choice.

276
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:07,791
I'll explain it to
you once. For 500 yul.

277
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:09,041
[ASTA]
He's charging me?

278
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:10,250
You wanna know
how I've been able

279
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:12,083
to respond to his attacks?

280
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:13,666
It's 'cause I've been
pickin' up on somethin'

281
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:16,583
that the people back
in my country call "ki."

282
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:19,666
"Ki"? You weren't
sensing his mana?

283
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,708
[YAMI]
Nope.

284
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:25,583
[YAMI] A person's glance,
their breathing, their scent,

285
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:28,875
the way their muscles move,
the hint of their presence.

286
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:31,333
Taken together, all of
that living energy

287
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:34,791
people give off.
That's called ki.

288
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,750
All I've been doing
is reading his ki

289
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:39,958
and using it to
predict his moves.

290
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:43,583
You've never done
anything like that before?

291
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,583
Actually, yeah.

292
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:48,791
That's my fighting style.

293
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,541
I combine the ability
to sense ki with my magic

294
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:54,333
and the strength of my muscles.

295
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:57,708
Think of it as me being
a buff magical swordsman.

296
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:59,541
[ASTA] You're not kidding
about the buff part.

297
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:01,458
Your neck's as thick as a tree.

298
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:04,500
[YAMI] Heh. Have you
seen your neck lately?

299
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:05,916
Insolent.

300
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,250
Carrying on a
conversation mid-battle--

301
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,166
do they think we're fools?

302
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,500
That captain certainly
is a mystery.

303
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:16,583
He's surprisingly quick for
someone who looks so sloppy.

304
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,166
He cannot be permitted
to show you

305
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,708
any further disrespect, Master.

306
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:24,583
Please pardon my impertinence,
but if I may step in.

307
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:27,250
Much appreciated, Valtos.

308
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:30,083
You're always so eager
to be of use.

309
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:32,791
All right. The boy, perhaps.

310
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:34,791
Would you capture him for me?

311
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:37,458
I don't mind if you need
to hurt him a bit.

312
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,375
It would be my pleasure, Master.

313
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:50,291
That was close!

314
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:51,916
[YAMI]
Hey, good timing.

315
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,416
Practice on the evil
scarecrow over there.

316
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,208
[ASTA] What? You want me
to take on that guy?

317
00:17:57,291 --> 00:18:00,166
We talked about this!
There's no way I'll be able to--

318
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:04,166
There's a saying where I'm from.

319
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:08,291
Whatever happens, a warrior
never goes back on his word.

320
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:12,125
You did say you were gonna
be the Wizard King, right?

321
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:16,375
This is where you gotta
push past your limits.

322
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:19,333
If you don't, then your
path ends here.

323
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:22,875
Yes, sir!

324
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:28,166
[ASTA] I have no idea
what I'm supposed to do,

325
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,083
so I'll just concentrate.

326
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:31,625
Concentrate.

327
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,291
[sighs]

328
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:36,416
You truly think you'll be
able to detect my attacks?

329
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,458
An idiot boy who
can't use magic.

330
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:43,583
There it is!

331
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:46,833
I guess I missed some.

332
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,500
Nice try.

333
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:50,250
You think I wouldn't
notice you usin'

334
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:52,000
just one of your senses?

335
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:55,041
The only things you had
workin' there were your ears.

336
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:56,750
That isn't reading ki.

337
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,041
If you wanna do this right,

338
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:00,250
then you gotta feel it
with your whole body.

339
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:01,625
You got that?

340
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,083
My whole body?

341
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:04,333
[YAMI]
Yep.

342
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:07,750
Don't rely only on your
ears or just your eyes.

343
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:09,041
It's like, uh,

344
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:11,166
somethin' in between
intuition and prediction.

345
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,750
Now do it right this time,
or I'll kill ya.

346
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,666
[ASTA]
This is insane!

347
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:20,958
[ASTA] Still. I think
I kinda get it now.

348
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:25,958
Not only my ears, not just
my eyes. All right.

349
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:31,208
I gotta reset everything
and concentrate.

350
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:40,250
[ASTA]
Yes! There it is!

351
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,083
[gasps]

352
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:50,583
[VALTOS groans]

353
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:56,791
It worked! [laughs]

354
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:58,958
Captain Yami, did ya see me?!

355
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:00,000
Really?

356
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:01,500
You actually managed
to pull it off?

357
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,208
No way. You're a freak.

358
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:05,583
[ASTA]
Wha--?

359
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:10,333
[VALTOS groaning]

360
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:11,958
[LICHT]
Valtos.

361
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:16,916
[LICHT]
You hurt him. How dare you?

362
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:22,000
[LICHT] I will not allow
humans like you to continue

363
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:24,125
harming my compatriots.

364
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:26,458
You've done too much
damage already.

365
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:29,041
Jeez. What's this
guy's problem?

366
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:31,541
They're the ones who
started all this.

367
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:35,625
As you can see,
this particular spell

368
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:39,041
traces an ever-changing track
of whip-like undulations.

369
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:41,708
Can you anticipate
these movements?

370
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,166
[LICHT] Long ago,
when a person had sinned,

371
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,833
the punishment was flogging.

372
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:51,541
One popular instrument
used was a whip.

373
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:55,166
I find this a very fitting end
for the likes of you!

374
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,166
Light Creation Magic:

375
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,416
Light Whip of Judgment!

376
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:06,125
[LICHT laughing]

377
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:08,291
Your struggles are pointless!

378
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,791
It's crumbling!

379
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:18,666
[laughs] That nutball's not
holding anything back!

380
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,083
[yelps]

381
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:23,625
[screams]

382
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:47,375
Goodness.

383
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:50,041
And here I was attempting
to restrain myself.

384
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:52,833
Poor fools. You truly are weak.

385
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:56,583
Your kingdom as well.
It, too, will fall.

386
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:58,333
You destroyed them, Master.

387
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:01,291
Surely only a god
could wield such power.

388
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:03,541
If you wished it, all of
the Clover Kingdom's

389
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:06,541
Magic Knights would
cower before you!

390
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:09,250
[ASTA, YAMI yell]

391
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:11,250
No! They live?

392
00:23:46,541 --> 00:23:48,875
[YAMI] So, the Eye of
the Midnight Sun's boss,

393
00:23:48,958 --> 00:23:50,250
Licht, was it?

394
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:52,125
That's quite a forehead
you got there.

395
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:54,083
Or should I call it a fivehead?

396
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:57,875
<i>Black Clover</i> , Page 35:
"The Light of Judgment."

397
00:23:57,958 --> 00:24:00,875
My magic is pushing
past my limits!
