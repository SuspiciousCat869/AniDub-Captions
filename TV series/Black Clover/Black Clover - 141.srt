1
00:00:22,303 --> 00:00:23,888
[NARRATOR]
The Clover Kingdom.

2
00:00:23,972 --> 00:00:26,391
In this place where
magic is everything,

3
00:00:26,474 --> 00:00:29,269
there lives one boy
who was born without it.

4
00:00:29,352 --> 00:00:31,521
His name is Asta.

5
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:34,274
[NARRATOR]
His strength and determination

6
00:00:34,357 --> 00:00:36,651
helped him become
a Magic Knight.

7
00:00:36,735 --> 00:00:39,279
And despite the many
challenges he faces,

8
00:00:39,362 --> 00:00:43,074
he aims for the top
and refuses to give up!

9
00:00:43,158 --> 00:00:44,826
Rich or poor,

10
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:46,911
royalty or commoner,

11
00:00:46,995 --> 00:00:49,831
Asta believes anyone can shine.

12
00:00:49,914 --> 00:00:52,834
His mission is to prove
that to the whole world,

13
00:00:52,917 --> 00:00:55,754
and to become the
next Wizard King!

14
00:00:57,964 --> 00:00:58,798
[ASTA]
Yuno.

15
00:00:58,882 --> 00:01:00,884
You and me: we're family, right?

16
00:01:00,967 --> 00:01:02,218
[YUNO]
Yeah, of course.

17
00:01:02,302 --> 00:01:04,346
[ASTA] Not by blood
or anything, though.

18
00:01:04,429 --> 00:01:05,388
[YUNO]
Right.

19
00:01:05,472 --> 00:01:06,806
But we're closer
than a lot of people

20
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:09,059
who are related
by blood, aren't we?

21
00:01:09,142 --> 00:01:10,060
I guess so.

22
00:01:10,143 --> 00:01:11,811
Why, what's up?

23
00:01:11,895 --> 00:01:13,021
[ASTA]
I was thinking.

24
00:01:13,104 --> 00:01:15,273
You and me: we don't
have any real relatives,

25
00:01:15,357 --> 00:01:18,360
but we've got a lot
of great friends.

26
00:01:18,443 --> 00:01:20,904
I say we take all
the friends we meet,

27
00:01:20,987 --> 00:01:23,907
and we make them
our family instead!

28
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:25,075
Yeah!

29
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,843
[KLAUS]
Hmph.

30
00:03:06,926 --> 00:03:08,386
Tch.

31
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,930
[HAMON] I take it you three
are here to give reports, too.

32
00:03:11,014 --> 00:03:12,015
[KLAUS]
Indeed.

33
00:03:12,098 --> 00:03:13,933
We just finished
a mission in Kiten.

34
00:03:14,017 --> 00:03:15,310
Ah, yes!

35
00:03:15,393 --> 00:03:17,312
Kiten borders the Diamond
Kingdom, so the cultural

36
00:03:17,395 --> 00:03:20,940
juxtaposition makes it
a popular spot for gourmets.

37
00:03:21,024 --> 00:03:22,025
You're lucky!

38
00:03:22,108 --> 00:03:23,234
I wish I could've gone there

39
00:03:23,318 --> 00:03:25,737
instead of patrolling
the capital.

40
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,156
[LETOILE]
We're not on vacation, David.

41
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:34,621
[LETOILE] All these missions
must be wearing you down.

42
00:03:34,704 --> 00:03:35,622
[YUNO]
I'm fine.

43
00:03:35,705 --> 00:03:37,999
[HAMON laughs]
In times like this,

44
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:40,126
it's important to
get enough calories!

45
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:41,753
Would you like a snack?

46
00:03:41,836 --> 00:03:43,213
[YUNO]
No thanks.

47
00:03:43,296 --> 00:03:46,174
[MIMOSA] Why are we
just making small talk?

48
00:03:46,257 --> 00:03:48,843
[ALECDORA] There's that
cocky attitude again.

49
00:03:48,927 --> 00:03:51,262
He always said he'd
become the Wizard King,

50
00:03:51,346 --> 00:03:53,056
but after his success
in that last battle,

51
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:55,517
he became even more arrogant.

52
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,852
If only I hadn't been
possessed by that elf,

53
00:03:57,936 --> 00:04:01,272
I could've been useful
to Lord Vangeance!

54
00:04:01,356 --> 00:04:04,818
Yuno just got lucky,
that was all!

55
00:04:04,901 --> 00:04:05,985
[LETOILE]
The Captain's waiting.

56
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:07,278
Let's go in.

57
00:04:07,362 --> 00:04:08,863
[DAVID]
Sounds good!

58
00:04:08,947 --> 00:04:12,283
Yuno. I think you need to try
being a little bit friendlier.

59
00:04:12,367 --> 00:04:13,660
What? I'm friendly.

60
00:04:13,743 --> 00:04:15,453
[KLAUS]
He doesn't know.

61
00:04:15,537 --> 00:04:16,830
Well, sure, there's
nothing wrong

62
00:04:16,913 --> 00:04:18,873
with the way you are now,
but it might be nice

63
00:04:18,957 --> 00:04:20,917
if you'd consider smiling
every now and then,

64
00:04:21,001 --> 00:04:23,503
or throw in a joke
here and there.

65
00:04:23,586 --> 00:04:25,797
But I can't even picture
what that would be like,

66
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,966
so just forget I brought it up.

67
00:04:28,049 --> 00:04:29,843
Sure.

68
00:04:29,926 --> 00:04:31,845
We'll go one step at a time.

69
00:04:31,928 --> 00:04:33,054
I suppose.

70
00:04:33,138 --> 00:04:36,266
[BELL] But that's what
makes Yuno so cool!

71
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,978
[WILLIAM] Thank you all
for your reports.

72
00:04:40,061 --> 00:04:42,689
Klaus, Mimosa, Yuno.

73
00:04:42,772 --> 00:04:44,566
The residents of Kiten
have expressed

74
00:04:44,649 --> 00:04:46,276
their thanks to us again.

75
00:04:46,359 --> 00:04:48,319
You obviously did quite well.

76
00:04:48,403 --> 00:04:49,404
Sir!

77
00:04:49,487 --> 00:04:51,573
We're honored to
hear that, Captain.

78
00:04:51,656 --> 00:04:53,241
[ALECDORA grunts]

79
00:04:53,324 --> 00:04:55,994
[WILLIAM] Now, I realize
you've only just returned,

80
00:04:56,077 --> 00:04:58,371
but I have another
mission for you.

81
00:04:58,455 --> 00:05:01,499
Apparently, a herd of wild boars
came down from the mountains,

82
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:03,335
posing a threat
to Saussy Village.

83
00:05:03,418 --> 00:05:06,046
I'd ask another squad
to take care of it instead,

84
00:05:06,129 --> 00:05:08,173
but no one's available.

85
00:05:08,256 --> 00:05:09,841
I'll do it myself, sir!

86
00:05:09,924 --> 00:05:12,427
A few wild boars would
be nothing for me!

87
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,387
These aren't normal boars.

88
00:05:14,471 --> 00:05:16,598
According to the reports
we got from Saussy Village,

89
00:05:16,681 --> 00:05:20,226
they're actually magical
beasts covered in flames.

90
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,479
[WILLIAM]
The villagers are terrified.

91
00:05:22,562 --> 00:05:25,065
I'd like you all to go there
as a squad and eliminate

92
00:05:25,148 --> 00:05:27,817
the herd before too
much damage is done.

93
00:05:27,901 --> 00:05:29,861
Alecdora will lead this mission.

94
00:05:29,944 --> 00:05:31,071
Yes, sir!

95
00:05:31,154 --> 00:05:33,073
[WILLIAM] And remember,
I'm counting on you.

96
00:05:33,156 --> 00:05:34,783
[MAGIC KNIGHTS]
Right!

97
00:05:34,866 --> 00:05:36,576
[ALECDORA] No matter
what we're up against,

98
00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:38,870
I swear, I'll outdo you!

99
00:05:40,121 --> 00:05:42,248
[MAYOR 141A] I can't
believe the Golden Dawn

100
00:05:42,332 --> 00:05:44,209
was sent here to rescue us!

101
00:05:44,292 --> 00:05:46,378
[LOU]
I wish it was the Black Bulls.

102
00:05:46,461 --> 00:05:49,047
[NICK]
Yeah. I wanna see Asta again.

103
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:50,882
[YUNO]
You know Asta?

104
00:05:50,965 --> 00:05:52,175
Sure do!

105
00:05:52,258 --> 00:05:54,219
Asta, Noelle, and Magna
protected our village

106
00:05:54,302 --> 00:05:57,013
from some really bad guys!

107
00:05:57,097 --> 00:05:58,848
That's right, it was
a while ago now,

108
00:05:58,932 --> 00:06:00,350
but Saussy Village
is the place where

109
00:06:00,433 --> 00:06:02,977
the Eye of the Midnight
Sun was first seen.

110
00:06:03,061 --> 00:06:04,062
Uh-huh!

111
00:06:04,145 --> 00:06:06,022
The Black Bulls defeated
some wild boars

112
00:06:06,106 --> 00:06:07,524
when they were here, too!

113
00:06:07,607 --> 00:06:08,692
Oh, yeah?

114
00:06:08,775 --> 00:06:10,819
Then why don't we make
a game out of it?

115
00:06:10,902 --> 00:06:13,279
Let's see if we can
take out even more.

116
00:06:13,363 --> 00:06:14,406
I'm sure the Golden Dawn will--

No, David.

118

[ALECDORA] We're told the
boars are covered in flames,

119
00:06:18,618 --> 00:06:20,036
that sounds dangerous.

120
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,580
They are, and they seem
to be even more violent

121
00:06:22,664 --> 00:06:24,040
than they were last time.

122

we're going to do anymore.

Oh, man. You guys feel that?

125
00:06:37,971 --> 00:06:40,682

that only magical beasts have.

can't defeat these.

Right!

Wait a second.

135

If we don't figure out
what made them so violent

learn your place, Yuno!

A one? Too bad.

But that's still good enough

There's an area with
a high magical presence!

Let's take a look.

00:08:35,088 --> 00:08:36,089
All right.

[BEAST BOARS grunting, growling]

172
00:08:45,724 --> 00:08:48,309
[MIMOSA] I think that fruit
is what caused all this.

173
00:08:48,393 --> 00:08:49,394
[KLAUS]
Interesting.

174
00:08:49,477 --> 00:08:51,479
So that's why they're
on a rampage.

175
00:08:51,563 --> 00:08:53,023
Then we'll need
to eradicate all of it,

Good plan. You and

He was really outspoken earlier!

00:09:06,077 --> 00:09:07,537
[KLAUS]
If it's to protect someone,

182
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,206
he won't hesitate
to defy his superiors.

I doubt he even
realizes he overstepped.

[MAYOR 141A] Thank you,

[VILLAGER 141A]
Not only did you stop them,

187
00:09:22,344 --> 00:09:25,263
but you figured out what was
causing them to go berserk!

188
00:09:25,347 --> 00:09:26,556
And now that it's fixed,

189
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:28,183
we shouldn't need to
trouble the Magic Knights

with this issue again!

191

[ALECDORA] I'm glad
we could put you at ease.

[ALECDORA] I bet you're
really proud of yourself

193

What's with all the flowers?

Aw, they're adorable,
don't you think?

196

Since the boars
have calmed down,

a few as their pets!

When you see Asta,

tell him I've been working
on my spells, okay?

200
00:09:49,871 --> 00:09:51,790
Because if he's gonna
become the Wizard King,

201
00:09:51,873 --> 00:09:53,500
then I wanna be on
a Magic Knight squad

202
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:55,585
so he and I can work together!

203

Okay. I'll make sure he knows.

[MAGIC KNIGHTS gasp]

00:10:21,236 --> 00:10:22,612
It's located right at the border

00:10:22,696 --> 00:10:25,907

It's near Kiten, actually.

[GROUP gasps]

217
00:10:27,701 --> 00:10:30,036
[LANGRIS] Apparently, people
have seen Spade Kingdom soldiers

218
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,413
fighting in that area.

219
00:10:31,496 --> 00:10:35,083
So whatever's happening,
Spade is likely involved.

220
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:37,293
This is a dire situation,

but with everything
that's going on here,

I'd like you to take the
lead this time, if possible.

I wish I could be of
service to you, Captain,

Surely one of the other knights

Of course.

[LANGRIS] Are you sure
he was the right choice?

Was he the wrong choice?

No, I just think
there was probably

could've been chosen instead.

You're the only trash
I see in here.

316
00:15:03,184 --> 00:15:06,021
And it's bold of you to insult
a former senior Magic Knight.

317
00:15:06,104 --> 00:15:08,273
Not that you amateurs
would know the difference.

318
00:15:08,356 --> 00:15:10,191
I'd watch my tongue.

319
00:15:10,275 --> 00:15:14,612
You have no chance of winning!
You'd be wise to cooperate!

320
00:15:14,696 --> 00:15:17,198
Think so? 'Cause I
have my doubts.

321
00:15:19,367 --> 00:15:22,829
[ALECDORA] Sand Binding Magic:
Sand-Armored Heavy Guard!

322
00:15:22,912 --> 00:15:25,248
Sand? Well, that's interesting.

323
00:15:28,043 --> 00:15:29,669
[GEWALT]
It happens to be a perfect match

324
00:15:29,753 --> 00:15:31,921
for the spells that I use!

325
00:15:33,715 --> 00:15:37,510
[GEWALT] Black Earth Creation
Magic: Sludge Erosion!

326
00:15:39,262 --> 00:15:40,805
[MIMOSA]
Alecdora!

327
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:45,810
[MIMOSA] Plant Recovery Magic:
Dream-Healing Flower Cradle!

328
00:15:45,894 --> 00:15:47,812
Guess you're tougher
than you look.

329
00:15:47,896 --> 00:15:49,022
But we'll see how you do

330
00:15:49,105 --> 00:15:51,566
now that I've knocked out
one of your men.

331
00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:53,860
Well, this is
certainly a predicament.

332
00:15:53,943 --> 00:15:56,196
Not only does he have the
strength to be a Magic Knight,

333
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:58,990
he's also amplifying his
power with a magic item.

334
00:15:59,074 --> 00:16:03,370
Yes, but he's just one man.
So we still have the advantage.

335
00:16:03,453 --> 00:16:06,247
He has to be aware of that fact.

336
00:16:06,331 --> 00:16:09,542
[KLAUS] He's confident.
What could he be hiding?

337
00:16:09,626 --> 00:16:12,170
There's no use in thinking
about it too hard, right?

338
00:16:12,253 --> 00:16:13,630
[HAMON]
Whatever the enemy throws at us,

339
00:16:13,713 --> 00:16:17,175
we'll respond with a
delectable counterattack!

340
00:16:17,258 --> 00:16:20,762
Glass Creation Magic:
Verre Fleur!

341
00:16:20,845 --> 00:16:22,138
[GEWALT]
That's cute.

342
00:16:22,222 --> 00:16:25,225
[KLAUS] Steel Creation Magic:
Fierce Spiral Lance!

343
00:16:25,308 --> 00:16:26,810
Come on.

344
00:16:26,893 --> 00:16:29,604
This can't be what passes for
a Magic Knight squad these days.

345
00:16:31,189 --> 00:16:34,025
[LETOILE]
Compass Magic: Willful Compass!

346
00:16:35,944 --> 00:16:36,903
There!

347
00:16:36,986 --> 00:16:39,406
That one was
interesting, at least.

348
00:16:39,489 --> 00:16:41,700
[DAVID]
How's this for interesting?

349
00:16:41,783 --> 00:16:45,328
Dice Magic:
The Gambler's Fallacy!

350
00:16:45,412 --> 00:16:47,831
My luck's finally
turning around now.

351
00:16:47,914 --> 00:16:50,709
Unfortunately, I can't
say the same for you!

352
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,712
[DAVID gasps]

353
00:16:57,465 --> 00:17:01,094
[GEWALT] This is the greatest
treasure in the whole dungeon.

354
00:17:01,177 --> 00:17:03,179
No matter how powerful
a spell you cast,

355
00:17:03,263 --> 00:17:05,682
I can use this magic item
to suck it right up.

356
00:17:05,765 --> 00:17:07,392
Are you kidding me?

357
00:17:07,475 --> 00:17:08,393
Bell.

358
00:17:08,476 --> 00:17:11,187
I thought you'd
never ask, Yuno!

359
00:17:11,271 --> 00:17:14,024
[YUNO]
Wind Magic: Swift White Bow!

360
00:17:15,442 --> 00:17:18,236
Did you seriously
think that would work?

361
00:17:19,821 --> 00:17:23,783
That felt like a gentle
breeze from over here.

362
00:17:23,867 --> 00:17:26,536
[BELL]
Ugh! That's so annoying!

363
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:28,538
[GEWALT]
So, what's your next move?

364
00:17:28,621 --> 00:17:31,166
You guys get the message
by now, don't you?

365
00:17:31,249 --> 00:17:33,084
[YUNO]
It's crystal clear.

366
00:17:33,168 --> 00:17:35,795
Between the necklace and the
urn, you've already shown us

367
00:17:35,879 --> 00:17:39,007
every trick you've
got up your sleeve.

368
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:40,383
And now we can say for certain

369
00:17:40,467 --> 00:17:42,761
that you're no match
for the Golden Dawn.

370
00:17:42,844 --> 00:17:44,596
I should've helped them
fight those wild boars.

371
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:46,723
At least that would've
been more fun.

372
00:17:48,266 --> 00:17:49,809
[GEWALT]
If you're trying to provoke me,

373
00:17:49,893 --> 00:17:52,479
it's not going
to work, stupid brat.

374
00:17:52,562 --> 00:17:55,023
I dunno, you look
pretty salty over there.

375
00:17:55,106 --> 00:17:56,608
It's just as Yuno said.

376
00:17:56,691 --> 00:17:58,360
Our squad'll never
lose to a weakling

377
00:17:58,443 --> 00:18:00,987
who has to rely
on two magic items.

378
00:18:01,071 --> 00:18:02,697
If we gave up,
it would dishonor

379
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:04,949
the proud name of
the Golden Dawn!

380
00:18:05,033 --> 00:18:09,537
[HAMON] Let the scrumptious
battle begin!

381
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:11,915
If that's what you want,
then be my guest!

382
00:18:11,998 --> 00:18:13,875
I'll absorb all your mana!

383
00:18:15,126 --> 00:18:16,586
[YUNO grunts]

384
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:18,505
[KLAUS grunts]

385
00:18:18,588 --> 00:18:20,382
[DAVID]
Luck's on our side!

386
00:18:22,592 --> 00:18:24,344
[HAMON laughs]

387
00:18:24,427 --> 00:18:25,512
Morons.

388
00:18:25,595 --> 00:18:27,681
You don't know when
to give up, do you?

389
00:18:29,265 --> 00:18:31,309
You probably shouldn't
be moving around.

390
00:18:31,393 --> 00:18:33,436
Don't worry, Mimosa, I'm fine.

391
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,314
Help Shiren. He needs you more.

392
00:18:36,398 --> 00:18:38,400
Find us a place
with fainter mana.

393
00:18:38,483 --> 00:18:41,194
I will try my best to pinpoint
some weak spots in the walls.

394
00:18:41,277 --> 00:18:43,238
Okay!

395
00:18:43,321 --> 00:18:46,157
Wind Magic: Tornado Fang!

396
00:18:46,241 --> 00:18:47,951
[GEWALT grunts]

397
00:18:48,034 --> 00:18:50,036
You almost had me that time!

398
00:18:51,329 --> 00:18:53,373
[GEWALT]
No, it can't be!

399
00:18:53,456 --> 00:18:56,251
Dammit. He's persistent!

400
00:18:56,334 --> 00:18:57,794
[KLAUS]
I'll finish this now!

401
00:18:57,877 --> 00:19:01,423
Steel Magic:
Blazing Spiral Lance!

402
00:19:01,506 --> 00:19:04,551
[DAVID] Dice Magic:
The Gambler's Fallacy!

403
00:19:04,634 --> 00:19:07,679
There, that should be
enough to settle it.

404
00:19:07,762 --> 00:19:09,848
[GEWALT] Looks like it's
a test of endurance!

405
00:19:09,931 --> 00:19:11,558
You'd better hope
your mana reserves

406
00:19:11,641 --> 00:19:14,310
don't run out before
my magic items break!

407
00:19:14,394 --> 00:19:16,187
[YUNO]
We're not aiming for you.

408
00:19:16,271 --> 00:19:19,232
[LETOILE]
Compass Magic: Willful Compass!

409
00:19:22,402 --> 00:19:24,446
[GEWALT grunts]

410
00:19:24,529 --> 00:19:25,822
[GEWALT]
A pitfall?

411
00:19:25,905 --> 00:19:28,033
That's what they were
planning all along?

412
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,328
[BELL] Thanks for leaving me
with the heavy lifting.

413
00:19:34,456 --> 00:19:38,585
[GEWALT]
Don't forget. I still have this!

414
00:19:38,668 --> 00:19:41,129
[ALECDORA] You've reached
the end of the line!

415
00:19:41,212 --> 00:19:43,381
[GEWALT]
You fool! I already told you,

416
00:19:43,465 --> 00:19:46,551
my type of magic has
the advantage over yours!

417
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:50,347
[gasps]

418
00:19:54,976 --> 00:19:56,811
Yes, and I told you.

419
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:57,854
[GEWALT gasping]

420
00:19:57,937 --> 00:20:00,774
[screams]

421
00:20:03,443 --> 00:20:05,737
You can try, but you're
simply no match

422
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:08,156
for the knights
of the Golden Dawn.

423
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:14,454
[WILLIAM] Thank you for leading
this mission, Alecdora.

424
00:20:14,537 --> 00:20:16,790
[ALECDORA] You should know,
sir, at one point,

425
00:20:16,873 --> 00:20:20,085
I was unable to fight after
sustaining an injury.

426
00:20:20,168 --> 00:20:21,252
Without my squadmates,

427
00:20:21,336 --> 00:20:23,296
there would've been
no hope of success.

428
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:26,257
I see. And what's
your view, Yuno?

429
00:20:26,341 --> 00:20:29,678
Alecdora commanded
our team perfectly.

430
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:32,597
Why are you trying
to make me look good?

431
00:20:32,681 --> 00:20:34,766
I'm only telling them the truth.

432
00:20:34,849 --> 00:20:37,310
[ALECDORA] Then allow me
to be honest, as well.

433
00:20:37,394 --> 00:20:39,562
When you came to the Golden
Dawn, some of our squad

434
00:20:39,646 --> 00:20:41,940
looked down on you
for being a commoner.

435
00:20:42,023 --> 00:20:44,567
They resented you and were
jealous of your powers.

436
00:20:44,651 --> 00:20:46,778
And I was no exception.

437
00:20:46,861 --> 00:20:48,321
What could possibly possess you

438
00:20:48,405 --> 00:20:51,199
to stand up for a group
of people like us?

439
00:20:51,282 --> 00:20:54,911
[YUNO] We're comrades.
I don't need another reason.

440
00:20:54,994 --> 00:20:57,038
Just that I care.

441
00:20:57,122 --> 00:20:59,708
In the past, I was also
guilty of thinking someone's

442
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:02,627
low social status made them
less worthy of respect.

443
00:21:02,711 --> 00:21:04,629
But after being
rescued by a commoner

444
00:21:04,713 --> 00:21:08,216
with no magic or manners,
I reconsidered my prejudices.

445
00:21:08,299 --> 00:21:10,301
Don't you dare
compare me to him.

446
00:21:10,385 --> 00:21:11,553
Yuno, please!

447
00:21:11,636 --> 00:21:12,512
Apologies.

448
00:21:12,595 --> 00:21:13,763
What?

449
00:21:13,847 --> 00:21:16,057
Okay, but I'm not sure
what you're sorry about.

450
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:18,727
I wouldn't expect
you to understand,

451
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:22,564
but I'd be wrong
to let it go unsaid.

452
00:21:22,647 --> 00:21:24,482
Even so, I still
don't acknowledge you

453
00:21:24,566 --> 00:21:26,109
as one of us!

454
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:31,573

Are you here to give a report?

457
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,036
[YUNO]
Yes.

458
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:37,078
[HAMON]
When we're finished,

459
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:39,664
let's all go out
to eat together!

to bond with the squad!

That sounds wonderful!

Hey, come back!

[HAMON]
You're invited.

466
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:51,634
In fact, we specifically
invited you.

Oh, I didn't...

470
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:59,184
[DAVID] Yeah, we thought it
might be fun to hit the town

471
00:21:59,267 --> 00:22:01,728
with the whole squad and party!

472
00:22:01,811 --> 00:22:04,397
[ASTA] You and me, we don't
have any real relatives,

473
00:22:04,481 --> 00:22:06,941
but we've got a lot
of great friends.

474
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:08,610
Let's take all
the friends we meet

475
00:22:08,693 --> 00:22:11,946
and make them
our family instead!

476
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:15,075
Are you coming with us, Yuno?

477
00:22:15,158 --> 00:22:16,868
Hold on. Are you blushing?

478
00:22:16,951 --> 00:22:17,952
[YUNO]
Of course not.

479
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:19,371
Looks like you are.

480
00:22:19,454 --> 00:22:20,205
[YUNO]
I'm not.

481
00:22:20,288 --> 00:22:21,873
[BELL]
Ooh, I wanna see!

482
00:22:21,956 --> 00:22:23,416
[YUNO]
I said no!

483
00:23:57,052 --> 00:23:59,179
[ASTA] We're gonna train hard
and get even stronger

484
00:23:59,262 --> 00:24:02,599
so we can fight the Spade
Kingdom and defeat the devil!

485

"Those Remaining."

486
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,730
Wait, who are you guys?

487
00:24:08,813 --> 00:24:10,815
Do you want the
devil to die, too?
