[NARRATOR]
Threatened by a ruthless demon,

2
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:18,541
humanity was on the
brink of destruction.

3
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:25,250
All seemed lost until a lone
mage stepped forward

4
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:27,041
and took up the fight.

5
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,041
After his triumph, he was
hailed as the Wizard King,

6
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:39,458
and his story became legend.

7
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:44,125
The names of those who had
passed the Royal Knights

were finally announced.

9
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:52,000
Zora, who'd also passed,
was late to the ceremony.

10
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:54,166
With the inclusion of three
additional members,

11
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,958
Shiren Tium, Cob Portaport,
and Nozel Silva,

12

Captain of the Silver Eagles,
the ranks of the Royal Knights

13
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:02,916
would now boast a total
of 20 elite warriors.

00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:05,833
[MEREOLEONA]
Victory is all we need!

15
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:08,375
The Eye of the Midnight Sun
is a contemptible

16
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:09,833
terrorist organization!

17
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:12,250
If we don't pull it up
by the roots ourselves,

18
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:14,791
our nation will
never know peace!

19
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:16,666
Rest assured, we will
be making our way

20
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,583
to their base immediately!

21
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:19,791
Listen up!

22
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:22,083
It lies in the floating
dungeon found within

23
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:25,583
the strong magic region
called Gravito Stones!

[LEOPOLD]
It's nice of you to stop by,

25
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,875
even though we're rivals.

26
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:09,833
According to my sister,
you two were scrappy enough

27
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:12,708
to be selected for the
Royal Knights, very impressive!

28
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:14,458
Yeah! And we're
about to take down

29
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:16,125
the Eye of the Midnight Sun!

30
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:18,208
We're departing in three days.

31
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:20,625
Until then, we're staying
in the capital to keep info

32
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:22,041
from leaking.

33
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:23,791
Gotcha.

34
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:25,166
[NOELLE]
So, um...

35
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,666
How's Fuegoleon doing?

36
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,708
He's still unconscious.

37
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:32,666
After the capital was attacked,
he was abducted.

38
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,125
They must've done
something to him,

39
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:36,000
but we never figured
out what it was.

40
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:38,916
Whatever it is, it's bad.

41
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,750
Though, if he were conscious,
I know exactly how he'd react.

42
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:47,333
He'd say, "I failed to
overpower my opponent

43
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:49,291
because I'm lacking experience."

44
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:54,166
Either way, it's not
the end for me.

45
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,625
I'll train harder and
surpass you both.

46
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:57,666
Watch me!

47
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,125
Wow, Leopold.

48
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,416
I'll get revenge for
Captain Fuegoleon.

49
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,875
Don't worry about that!

50
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:06,291
Unlike most people,
he didn't laugh at my dream

51
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:08,583
of becoming the
next Wizard King.

52
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:11,625
He even called me a rival!

53
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:16,041
I am who I am now 'cause Captain
Fuegoleon believed in me.

54
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,500
And so am I.

55
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:20,333
There isn't any shame
in being weak, girl.

56
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,166
The shame is in staying weak.

57
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:27,291
What he said helped
me to grow stronger.

58

Asta. Noelle.
I'm counting on you.

Trust me! We're gonna bring
peace to the Clover Kingdom!

So Captain Fuegoleon and
Finral are both unconscious now.

66
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:03,666
I hope they wake up
before too much longer.

67
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:07,208
Actually, the way
that mana felt before...

68
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:09,291
It might have had something
to do with the Eye of the

69
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,541
Midnight Sun.

70
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:14,208
We've got to defeat them fast.

You're right.

00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:18,083
But you know, there's somethin'
that's been buggin' me

00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:19,833
for a long time now.

[NOELLE]
Huh?

00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:24,333
Well, back when I was
fighting that big hairy guy.

76
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,666
He said they'd never forgive us.

77
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,708
That we're fighting because
we have a grudge.

78
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:33,458
So, does that mean if
we forgave each other

79
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,458
we wouldn't have to fight?

80
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:36,875
But who is "we"?

81
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:42,000
I don't know! It feels like
the more I talk about this,

82
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:43,666
the more I confuse myself!

Yup, don't worry about me.

It's certainly a

Think of the individuals

It should be fairly
easy to invade.

Oh. Right, I'm sorry.

Listen carefully!

293
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,750
The best way to beat them
is to cause confusion

294
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:34,750
with a surprise attack.

295
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,833
Usually, we'd enter
separately to keep them

296
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:38,791
from anticipating our moves.

297
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:43,291
But, having so many points
of entry means the opponent

298
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:46,333
is likely to be confident
in their defenses.

299
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:48,708
The more spread out we are,
the easier it will be

300
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:50,958
for them to overpower
us instead.

301
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:53,750
Which means, the most
logical tactic is--

00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,333
[ASTA]
I know!

303
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:57,375
We just have to psych ourselves
up so we can fight these guys

304
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:58,875
even harder!

305
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,458
I can take care of them myself.
No psyching up necessary.

306
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:06,125
I'll beat 'em senseless and
crush their bones into powder!

307
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:08,250
I shall use my immaculate
power to clear them out

308
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,166
in one beautiful swoop!

309
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,958
Please just disappear.

I'm surrounded by morons.

311
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:16,708
Balance is key.

312
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:19,375
If the idea is to break up their
numbers and still be able

313
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:22,166
to overcome them, then the
best plan is to split into

314
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,833
teams of four.

315
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,375
Don't you agree, Captain?

316
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:27,250
Wholeheartedly.

317
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:30,333
So we'll divide into five teams
of four and make our move.

318
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:32,041
As long as I'm not
stuck on the same team

319
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,000
as this obnoxious rugrat,
I guess I'll be all right
