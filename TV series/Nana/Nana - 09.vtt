WEBVTT

00:00:01.135 --> 00:00:04.408
(rapid footsteps)

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.458
(Nana pants)

00:00:18.606 --> 00:00:20.777
- [Nana Komatsu] Nana had
a tattoo of a red lotus

00:00:20.877 --> 00:00:21.712
on her arm.

00:00:21.812 --> 00:00:25.285
A lotus also known
as a Ren flower.

00:00:25.385 --> 00:00:29.360
At the time, I had no idea
what that meant to her.

00:00:30.228 --> 00:00:33.636
(upbeat rock music)

00:02:09.426 --> 00:02:12.399
(birds chirp)

00:02:14.003 --> 00:02:16.809
(gentle music)

00:02:20.783 --> 00:02:26.394
- It's way too bright in here.
I need to get some curtains.

00:02:28.064 --> 00:02:30.736
(dog barks)

00:02:45.065 --> 00:02:46.735
I gotta get to work!

00:02:46.835 --> 00:02:48.404
What time is it?

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:50.308
Ah!

00:02:52.112 --> 00:02:52.914
What am I gonna do?

00:02:53.014 --> 00:02:54.216
- Well, good morning, Hachi.

00:02:54.316 --> 00:02:56.555
It's a beautiful day. Wanna go
for a walk?

00:02:56.655 --> 00:02:57.690
- Why didn't you wake me up?

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:58.559
Why? Why? Why?

00:02:58.659 --> 00:02:59.393
- How's that my job?

00:02:59.493 --> 00:03:01.430
You got an alarm clock. Don't
you?

00:03:01.532 --> 00:03:03.168
- I'm supposed to be starting
work at 11

00:03:03.268 --> 00:03:04.738
and now I'm gonna late for first
day!

00:03:04.838 --> 00:03:08.178
- What do you mean late?
It's only seven o'clock.

00:03:08.278 --> 00:03:11.217
Even if you leave at 10, you'll
still have plenty of time.

00:03:11.317 --> 00:03:12.019
No need to panic.

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:14.724
- What the hell? My clock said
it was 11!

00:03:14.824 --> 00:03:17.329
- (laughing) You mean the clock

00:03:17.429 --> 00:03:19.300
you got from Mizukoshi
yesterday?

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.903
It's already broken?

00:03:22.105 --> 00:03:26.949
- Nana! I don't think
this clock even works.

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:30.656
It still says the same time
as when I set it last night.

00:03:30.756 --> 00:03:33.261
Aw! As soon as I see Mr.
Mizukoshi,

00:03:33.361 --> 00:03:34.330
I'm gonna let him have it.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:35.065
That's for sure.

00:03:35.165 --> 00:03:37.503
- Better check to see if
the fridge is still working.

00:03:37.604 --> 00:03:38.939
Ah, feels nice and cool.

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:40.576
- [Nana Komatsu] What'd you put
in there?

00:03:40.676 --> 00:03:41.778
- Beer.

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:42.547
Want one?

00:03:42.647 --> 00:03:43.348
- [Nana Komatsu] Yeah!

00:03:43.448 --> 00:03:45.085
- Are you kidding me?
You gotta go to work.

00:03:45.185 --> 00:03:46.220
- But I'm really, really thirsty

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.991
and I'm really, really hungry
too.

00:03:48.091 --> 00:03:49.961
And there's nothing to eat here.

00:03:50.061 --> 00:03:50.830
- Oh. That reminds me.

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.903
That burger you bought
it tasted really good.

00:03:54.003 --> 00:03:54.169
Thanks for that.

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.575
- You ate the whole thing
on your own? No fair!

00:03:56.675 --> 00:03:58.712
- Then why'd you say it
was a present for me?

00:03:58.812 --> 00:04:01.852
(bright music)

00:04:01.952 --> 00:04:03.522
- Maybe there's a nice cafe
around here

00:04:03.622 --> 00:04:04.691
where we can get something to
eat.

00:04:04.791 --> 00:04:06.260
- [Nana Osaki] It's too early
in the morning for that.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.935
I'll just get you some dog
food from the corner store.

00:04:13.174 --> 00:04:16.013
- [Nana Komatsu] Look at
that cute little bakery!

00:04:16.113 --> 00:04:17.517
(Nana K. Screams)

00:04:17.617 --> 00:04:18.384
What should I have?

00:04:18.484 --> 00:04:19.654
Oh! It all looks too good to be
true!

00:04:19.754 --> 00:04:23.061
- You really do seem to
have a keen sense of smell.

00:04:23.161 --> 00:04:24.764
Just like a dog...

00:04:24.864 --> 00:04:27.402
- Let's go sit by the
river. It'll be so nice.

00:04:27.503 --> 00:04:29.541
Like a mini picnic!

00:04:30.308 --> 00:04:32.580
- We really need to get a table.

00:04:36.888 --> 00:04:37.724
- Hey Nana.

00:04:37.824 --> 00:04:39.426
Isn't someone from the gas
company

00:04:39.527 --> 00:04:41.364
supposed to come turn it on
today?

00:04:41.464 --> 00:04:43.836
- Yeah, like I said, they'd be
here sometime in the morning,

00:04:43.936 --> 00:04:46.440
but don't worry. I wasn't
planning to go anywhere today.

00:04:46.541 --> 00:04:49.079
So you go to work and I'll deal
with it.

00:04:49.179 --> 00:04:51.384
You're also getting your
stuff from your folks place

00:04:51.484 --> 00:04:52.654
delivered today. Aren't ya?

00:04:52.754 --> 00:04:54.023
I can sign for that if you want.

00:04:54.123 --> 00:04:57.396
- Sorry. I seem to be dumping
everything on you today.

00:04:57.496 --> 00:04:58.565
- Not a problem.

00:04:58.666 --> 00:05:00.068
I've got time to kill.

00:05:00.168 --> 00:05:03.041
- But Nana, what are
you gonna do about work?

00:05:03.141 --> 00:05:04.878
Don't you have to find a job?

00:05:06.347 --> 00:05:09.888
- It's easy to find a job, if
you don't care what you do.

00:05:12.059 --> 00:05:15.265
- I wonder if she's right.
Is it really that easy?

00:05:15.365 --> 00:05:17.135
(upbeat music)

00:05:17.235 --> 00:05:18.906
Like I'm one to talk.

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:22.847
Hi, welcome to the store.

00:05:22.947 --> 00:05:23.949
- [Junko] Well.

00:05:25.251 --> 00:05:25.720
- [Nana Komatsu] Jun!

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.255
- Gotta say this place really
suits you.

00:05:27.356 --> 00:05:30.529
You know, Shoji dropped
around our place last night.

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:31.430
He said you were working here
now

00:05:31.531 --> 00:05:34.571
so I thought I'd swing by
and see how you're doing.

00:05:34.671 --> 00:05:37.075
I'm glad you found a good job.

00:05:37.175 --> 00:05:37.777
- Really?

00:05:37.877 --> 00:05:41.217
Shoji went over to your place
after I saw him yesterday?

00:05:41.317 --> 00:05:41.852
- Yeah.

00:05:41.952 --> 00:05:44.023
He and Kyosuke got totally
wasted.

00:05:44.123 --> 00:05:44.824
- Oh thank God.

00:05:44.924 --> 00:05:47.129
I thought he might have gone to
Sachiko's

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:48.231
and spent the night with her.

00:05:48.331 --> 00:05:49.501
- Sachiko? Who's that?

00:05:49.601 --> 00:05:51.203
- She's sorta like a
femme fatale, you know,

00:05:51.303 --> 00:05:53.542
like you see in all those
old black and white movies?

00:05:53.642 --> 00:05:55.546
- Do you know how crazy you
sound?

00:05:55.646 --> 00:05:56.715
- Nana, this a friend of yours?

00:05:56.815 --> 00:05:58.752
Hey, it's nice to meet you.

00:05:58.852 --> 00:06:00.455
I'm Mizukoshi the manager here.

00:06:00.556 --> 00:06:03.361
- Mr. Mizukoshi this
is my best friend Jun.

00:06:03.461 --> 00:06:04.631
She's an art student.

00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:07.402
- Thank you for looking
after our little Nana.

00:06:07.503 --> 00:06:08.572
- [Mizukoshi] Your name's Jun?

00:06:08.672 --> 00:06:10.108
Not Nana like the rest?

00:06:10.208 --> 00:06:10.876
(Nana laughs)

00:06:10.976 --> 00:06:13.448
- Stop that. Mr. Mizukoshi.

00:06:13.549 --> 00:06:15.385
- Now, then, Hachi.
- Hachi?

00:06:15.485 --> 00:06:16.287
- You were asking me about this
clock.

00:06:16.387 --> 00:06:17.857
- Did you fix it?

00:06:17.957 --> 00:06:19.493
- Well, the reason it wasn't
working

00:06:19.594 --> 00:06:21.965
is 'cause it needs a battery
inside.

00:06:22.967 --> 00:06:24.637
- Oh no! I'm such a fool!

00:06:24.738 --> 00:06:26.273
I should've checked. I'm sorry.

00:06:26.374 --> 00:06:27.242
- That's okay.

00:06:27.342 --> 00:06:28.311
It's partly my fault.

00:06:28.411 --> 00:06:29.948
I should have checked if
there was already one in there

00:06:30.048 --> 00:06:32.653
when you bought it. Just remind
me to give you one later.

00:06:32.754 --> 00:06:35.125
- All right. I'm sorry
to be so much trouble.

00:06:35.225 --> 00:06:35.860
- Ah, forget about it.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.229
If you want to go on your lunch
break now

00:06:37.329 --> 00:06:39.233
while your friend's here.
That's cool with me.

00:06:39.333 --> 00:06:40.168
- Really?

00:06:40.268 --> 00:06:41.505
You sure that's okay with you?

00:06:41.605 --> 00:06:43.876
- [Mizukoshi] Yeah, I can watch
the store.

00:06:43.976 --> 00:06:48.017
- All right then I guess
I'll see you later.

00:06:48.117 --> 00:06:50.589
- [Junko] Looks like your
flirting sicknesses started
again.

00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:54.096
- This Jackson burger is
like the best burger ever.

00:06:55.633 --> 00:06:57.235
- [Junko] I was wondering how
you managed

00:06:57.335 --> 00:06:58.539
to find a job that fast.

00:06:58.639 --> 00:06:59.239
Now I know.

00:06:59.339 --> 00:07:02.680
I didn't expect the
manager to be so young.

00:07:04.818 --> 00:07:07.122
- Koji Sato, Can I get another
burger?

00:07:07.222 --> 00:07:09.126
- [Sato] Coming up!

00:07:09.226 --> 00:07:10.963
- Well, it makes no difference
to me,

00:07:11.063 --> 00:07:13.502
but I guess as long as you do
your work and get paid for it,

00:07:13.602 --> 00:07:15.338
it doesn't matter what your
motives are.

00:07:15.438 --> 00:07:17.275
Even if they are totally out of
whack.

00:07:17.375 --> 00:07:19.814
Just try not to freaks
Shoji out too much. Okay?

00:07:19.914 --> 00:07:21.350
When he was drunk last night,

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:23.722
he started grumbling about you
again.

00:07:23.822 --> 00:07:27.129
- He was grumbling? And
he's done it more than once?

00:07:27.229 --> 00:07:28.766
- Well, I....

00:07:28.866 --> 00:07:29.768
- I knew it. I knew it.

00:07:29.868 --> 00:07:32.172
Shoji doesn't really like
me after all. Does he?

00:07:32.272 --> 00:07:34.309
It's 'cause I'm a terrible
girlfriend!

00:07:34.409 --> 00:07:36.313
- No, it's not that.

00:07:39.419 --> 00:07:40.321
Shoji just gets worried,

00:07:40.421 --> 00:07:43.796
but that's only because he
cares so much about you.

00:07:43.896 --> 00:07:45.031
There aren't many guys around

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:47.603
who treat a girl that way, you
know?

00:07:48.505 --> 00:07:49.908
So you better treat him good

00:07:50.008 --> 00:07:52.680
or else fate will turn against
you.

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:56.253
(gentle piano music)

00:07:56.353 --> 00:08:01.397
- [Nana Komatsu] I know. I
know, but how do I not screw up?

00:08:01.497 --> 00:08:03.769
Well, what have I been doing
wrong?

00:08:03.869 --> 00:08:08.645
I mean, I thought things
were going fine up till now.

00:08:08.745 --> 00:08:11.885
Maybe I should have done
it with him last night.

00:08:11.985 --> 00:08:13.154
- Hey Nana. It's eight o'clock.

00:08:13.254 --> 00:08:16.093
Time to start closing up
the store for the night.

00:08:16.193 --> 00:08:17.262
- Oh, okay!

00:08:18.665 --> 00:08:19.501
- Thanks for hanging in there
today.

00:08:19.601 --> 00:08:21.437
I know it can be tiring even
when the store's not busy.

00:08:21.538 --> 00:08:24.309
- Oh. You don't have to
worry about me. I'm fine.

00:08:24.409 --> 00:08:25.946
I'm just so psyched to be
working in here

00:08:26.046 --> 00:08:28.719
with all this cool stuff.
I can't wait for tomorrow!

00:08:28.819 --> 00:08:30.756
- Well, I'm certainly glad to
hear it.

00:08:30.856 --> 00:08:31.323
You hungry?

00:08:31.423 --> 00:08:33.629
We could go grab something
to eat after we've closed up.

00:08:33.729 --> 00:08:34.631
My treat.

00:08:34.731 --> 00:08:36.635
- Really?

00:08:36.735 --> 00:08:38.171
- Is there anywhere you wanna
go?

00:08:38.271 --> 00:08:39.206
- [Junko] Fate will turn against
you.

00:08:39.306 --> 00:08:40.375
- What kind of food do
you feel like eating?

00:08:40.475 --> 00:08:41.978
- I'm sorry. I totally forgot.

00:08:42.078 --> 00:08:43.882
I already made plans for
tonight.

00:08:43.982 --> 00:08:45.018
Almost slipped my mind.

00:08:45.118 --> 00:08:45.753
- A date?

00:08:45.853 --> 00:08:47.590
- Oh no, no, no, no, nothing
like that.

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:49.493
- Listen. There's no
need to be embarrassed.

00:08:49.594 --> 00:08:52.465
I'd expect a cute young girl
like you to have a boyfriend

00:08:52.567 --> 00:08:54.336
or maybe even two. Right?

00:08:54.436 --> 00:08:57.910
Tell him to come by the shop.
I'll give him a discount.

00:08:58.444 --> 00:08:59.413
- Thanks.

00:08:59.514 --> 00:09:01.217
That's really generous.

00:09:02.252 --> 00:09:03.487
That was so awkward.

00:09:03.589 --> 00:09:06.595
Well, whatever I have Shoji.

00:09:06.695 --> 00:09:10.268
So I can't let myself get
too close to Mr. Mizukoshi.

00:09:14.309 --> 00:09:17.082
I feel bad for even thinking
about it.

00:09:17.182 --> 00:09:19.419
I am not a good girlfriend.

00:09:20.188 --> 00:09:21.390
No, no, no.

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:22.025
Shoji's the man for me.

00:09:22.125 --> 00:09:24.363
I can't live without him!

00:09:28.572 --> 00:09:30.543
I better give him a call.

00:09:30.643 --> 00:09:33.414
(phone dials)

00:09:34.584 --> 00:09:35.084
Shoji?

00:09:35.184 --> 00:09:35.920
- [Automated Voicemail]
Your call is being forwarded

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:37.890
to an automatic voicemail
system.

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:39.393
At the tone, please leave a-

00:09:39.493 --> 00:09:40.696
(phone beeps)

00:09:40.796 --> 00:09:43.467
- He's still at work?

00:09:43.569 --> 00:09:44.504
Just 'cause I live in Tokyo now

00:09:44.604 --> 00:09:47.510
doesn't mean I can
always hang out with him.

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:52.185
I know that, but doesn't
stop me wanting to see him.

00:09:52.285 --> 00:09:55.458
I guess I should have stayed
at his place last night.

00:09:56.761 --> 00:09:57.429
Once he starts school,

00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:59.767
he is gonna be so busy
with classes and studying

00:09:59.867 --> 00:10:01.905
and working all the time.

00:10:02.005 --> 00:10:04.243
And now I have a job too!

00:10:04.343 --> 00:10:08.184
After working all day, I'm not
gonna have any energy left.

00:10:09.821 --> 00:10:12.860
We might not get to see
each other very often.

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.799
Life isn't so sweet after all.

00:10:16.868 --> 00:10:17.837
When I first moved here,

00:10:17.937 --> 00:10:21.076
I thought everything would
just fall into place.

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:26.955
Wait a minute.

00:10:27.055 --> 00:10:30.629
Things are falling into
place and pretty easily too.

00:10:30.729 --> 00:10:31.931
It's all good.

00:10:32.032 --> 00:10:34.971
(gentle piano music)

00:10:35.071 --> 00:10:36.373
But for some reason it feels

00:10:36.473 --> 00:10:40.415
like I haven't been able to
grab hold of anything yet.

00:10:42.687 --> 00:10:44.991
Do I even know what I really
want?

00:10:45.091 --> 00:10:47.262
A life with Shoji?

00:10:47.362 --> 00:10:49.366
Cute clothes and stuff?

00:10:49.466 --> 00:10:51.705
A cool apartment?

00:10:51.805 --> 00:10:56.180
They're all great, but
something is missing.

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.785
Maybe I'm asking for too much.

00:11:07.035 --> 00:11:10.041
(hammer bangs)

00:11:17.857 --> 00:11:19.927
- Hey, how's it going, Hachiko?

00:11:20.028 --> 00:11:21.598
So, how was work?

00:11:21.698 --> 00:11:22.867
- What are you doing, Nana?

00:11:22.967 --> 00:11:24.771
- Oh, a little carpentry.

00:11:24.871 --> 00:11:27.576
I'm making us a table in some
chairs.

00:11:27.677 --> 00:11:28.679
- Wow. You can do that?

00:11:28.779 --> 00:11:29.781
That is so cool!

00:11:29.881 --> 00:11:32.118
- Well, we really needed a
table.

00:11:32.218 --> 00:11:34.056
I should be finished pretty
soon.

00:11:34.156 --> 00:11:36.060
Then we can have dinner on it.

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:36.861
- Huh?

00:11:36.961 --> 00:11:39.567
What are we gonna eat?
I didn't buy anything.

00:11:39.667 --> 00:11:41.136
I'll run to the store.

00:11:41.236 --> 00:11:43.608
- That's okay. I already
made us some stew.

00:11:43.709 --> 00:11:45.078
And a salad.

00:11:47.883 --> 00:11:50.589
- This looks really
great. I'm so impressed!

00:11:50.689 --> 00:11:51.791
- Oh and all your stuff arrived

00:11:51.891 --> 00:11:53.227
so I put the boxes in your room.

00:11:53.327 --> 00:11:55.365
The paperwork for the lease
had been signed by your dad.

00:11:55.465 --> 00:11:57.102
So I gave it all to Mr. Ondo for
you

00:11:57.202 --> 00:12:00.007
and got your key from
him. It's over there.

00:12:01.644 --> 00:12:03.247
(bright music)

00:12:03.347 --> 00:12:05.786
- Oh, thanks Nana! You're
the best!

00:12:05.886 --> 00:12:06.755
- What's the big deal?

00:12:06.855 --> 00:12:08.324
I didn't really do anything.

00:12:08.424 --> 00:12:11.463
(Nana K. sobs)

00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:13.267
Quit crying!

00:12:13.367 --> 00:12:15.572
(gentle music)

00:12:15.672 --> 00:12:17.442
- [Nana Komatsu] I'm so happy.

00:12:17.543 --> 00:12:19.146
Everything's awesome.

00:12:19.246 --> 00:12:22.419
I've been on a roll
since I moved to Tokyo.

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:24.924
Well, actually everything's been
great

00:12:25.024 --> 00:12:27.062
since I moved in with Nana.

00:12:27.162 --> 00:12:28.932
She makes me feel so positive.

00:12:29.032 --> 00:12:32.640
It's weird 'cause we're totally
different,

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:35.946
but it's like, we just clicked.

00:12:36.046 --> 00:12:39.119
(angelic music)

00:12:42.258 --> 00:12:43.695
Wow! It's wonderful!

00:12:43.795 --> 00:12:44.697
It fits perfectly.

00:12:44.797 --> 00:12:47.268
You wouldn't have bought
a better table than this.

00:12:47.368 --> 00:12:47.970
- You think?

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:49.239
So does that mean you like it?

00:12:49.339 --> 00:12:52.078
- Yeah. I had no idea
you were so talented.

00:12:52.178 --> 00:12:52.913
- Oh this was nothing.

00:12:53.013 --> 00:12:54.951
Just scrap wood from a
construction site.

00:12:55.051 --> 00:12:58.525
So basically we got ourselves
a dining set for free.

00:13:00.963 --> 00:13:02.733
I even got some of the
hot instruction guys

00:13:02.833 --> 00:13:04.369
to gimme a hand cutting the
wood.

00:13:04.469 --> 00:13:06.206
- You ever thought about
becoming a professional?

00:13:06.306 --> 00:13:08.210
You could be like a cool girl
carpenter!

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:10.248
You should totally do it!

00:13:10.949 --> 00:13:11.584
- Yeah, it'd be okay.

00:13:11.684 --> 00:13:14.122
But what if I cut my finger or
something?

00:13:14.222 --> 00:13:15.893
Then I wouldn't be able
to play the guitar.

00:13:15.993 --> 00:13:18.030
- [Nana Komatsu] Oh right.

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:18.999
Your guitar.

00:13:19.099 --> 00:13:20.636
- [Nana Osaki] Food's ready.

00:13:20.736 --> 00:13:21.170
- Hey Nana,

00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:24.644
does that mean you wanna be
a professional guitarist?

00:13:24.744 --> 00:13:26.213
- Are you kidding?

00:13:26.313 --> 00:13:29.620
I'm not good enough to make it
as a pro.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:33.394
- But I thought you played
guitar in your band back home?

00:13:33.494 --> 00:13:34.062
- Well sorta.

00:13:34.162 --> 00:13:37.368
I did play guitar, but
really I was the lead singer.

00:13:38.404 --> 00:13:40.074
- Oh my God. You're a singer?

00:13:40.174 --> 00:13:42.145
That's so cool. You never said.

00:13:42.245 --> 00:13:43.748
- Why is that so great?

00:13:43.849 --> 00:13:45.652
- Well, because-

00:13:45.752 --> 00:13:48.257
- You should probably wait
till you hear me sing first

00:13:48.357 --> 00:13:50.996
before you get too excited.

00:13:51.096 --> 00:13:54.937
(gentle piano music)

00:13:55.037 --> 00:13:57.041
- I wanna hear her sing.

00:13:57.142 --> 00:14:00.014
I bet she's awesome.

00:14:00.114 --> 00:14:03.955
I just know I'm gonna
be her biggest fan.

00:14:11.938 --> 00:14:15.411
Hey Nana, can I ask you about
that tattoo on your arm?

00:14:15.512 --> 00:14:17.215
I was just wondering if it
was real

00:14:17.315 --> 00:14:20.622
or if it's only a
temporary stick on thing.

00:14:20.722 --> 00:14:21.390
- Yeah, it's real.

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:24.062
- I knew it it's way
too cool to be a fake.

00:14:24.162 --> 00:14:26.099
Did it hurt like hell
when you had it done?

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:29.472
I was scared to death just
getting my ears pierced.

00:14:29.574 --> 00:14:32.646
- There's no pleasure in it
unless you have a little pain.

00:14:32.746 --> 00:14:33.815
- You really think so?

00:14:33.915 --> 00:14:34.951
- Feeling a little bit of pain

00:14:35.051 --> 00:14:36.588
reminds us that we're still
alive.

00:14:36.688 --> 00:14:37.523
- Masochist!

00:14:37.623 --> 00:14:38.558
(Nana O. laughs)

00:14:38.658 --> 00:14:40.929
- To tell you the truth.
I'm much more like a sadist.

00:14:41.029 --> 00:14:42.432
- I noticed.

00:14:44.102 --> 00:14:46.574
Hey Nana, what made you
choose a lotus blossom?

00:14:46.674 --> 00:14:48.410
Does it have like a special
meaning?

00:14:48.511 --> 00:14:52.018
- Actually it's not a
lotus. It's a ren flower.

00:14:52.118 --> 00:14:54.055
- You mean like a water lily?

00:14:54.155 --> 00:14:55.024
- No, it's just a ren.

00:14:55.124 --> 00:14:56.527
- So it is a lotus, then?

00:14:56.628 --> 00:14:57.161
- No, it's not a lotus.

00:14:57.262 --> 00:14:59.232
- I'm pretty sure it's
called the lotus flower.

00:14:59.332 --> 00:15:00.836
- [Nana Osaki] Just drop it.
Okay?

00:15:00.936 --> 00:15:02.205
- But it's totally a lotus
flower.

00:15:02.305 --> 00:15:03.675
Man, why are you so stubborn?

00:15:03.775 --> 00:15:05.612
- Right back at ya!

00:15:05.712 --> 00:15:06.614
(doorbell rings)

00:15:06.714 --> 00:15:07.248
- Huh?

00:15:07.348 --> 00:15:08.852
Who could be dropping by this
late?

00:15:08.952 --> 00:15:10.889
(knocking on door)

00:15:10.989 --> 00:15:13.060
- [Man] Delivery for Miss Osaki.

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.197
- Maybe Yasu sent your stuff
already.

00:15:15.298 --> 00:15:17.670
- Maybe he sure works
fast.

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:19.105
What a guy.

00:15:27.255 --> 00:15:29.059
- Good evening.

00:15:30.361 --> 00:15:32.800
- Nobu! What the hell are you
doing here?

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:34.336
- Yes! Nice!

00:15:34.436 --> 00:15:35.939
The welcome I always wanted.

00:15:36.039 --> 00:15:37.375
Yeah!

00:15:38.945 --> 00:15:40.849
Wow. The stew is amazing.

00:15:40.949 --> 00:15:41.618
You are amazing.

00:15:41.718 --> 00:15:43.989
You're gonna make someone
a great wife someday.

00:15:44.089 --> 00:15:44.890
- [Nana Komatsu] Yeah, but I
didn't-

00:15:44.991 --> 00:15:45.759
- You may have the same name as
Nana,

00:15:45.859 --> 00:15:46.460
but you're nothing like her.

00:15:46.561 --> 00:15:48.097
- Hey, thanks for the
compliment, Nobu.

00:15:48.197 --> 00:15:49.934
I'm the one who made the stew.

00:15:50.034 --> 00:15:51.270
- Oh yeah. That figures.

00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:53.073
It's a little too salty.

00:15:55.278 --> 00:15:58.050
- You don't like my
cooking then don't eat it.

00:15:58.150 --> 00:15:59.152
Why the hell did you come here
anyway?

00:15:59.252 --> 00:16:00.555
- I came here to deliver all
your crap!

00:16:00.656 --> 00:16:03.394
I drove eight hours to get
here and all you do is kick me.

00:16:03.494 --> 00:16:04.262
You should be thanking me.

00:16:04.362 --> 00:16:06.133
- Gee, thanks. Mission
accomplished.

00:16:06.233 --> 00:16:08.939
Now let's go back to where you
came from!

00:16:09.039 --> 00:16:10.609
- But Nana. Please. Listen!

00:16:10.709 --> 00:16:12.846
You gotta let me stay for just
one night.

00:16:12.947 --> 00:16:13.715
- No chance.

00:16:13.815 --> 00:16:14.382
- Yeah, but-

00:16:14.482 --> 00:16:15.585
- [Nana Osaki] I don't
don't wanna hear it.

00:16:15.686 --> 00:16:16.219
- I ran away from home.

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.457
- I told you I don't wanna hear
it.

00:16:18.558 --> 00:16:18.792
- Nana!

00:16:18.892 --> 00:16:20.963
- But I didn't have anywhere
else that I could go.

00:16:21.063 --> 00:16:22.733
- Why are you being so mean to
him?

00:16:22.833 --> 00:16:24.235
Isn't he your friend?

00:16:25.204 --> 00:16:27.509
Your name's Nobuo. Right?

00:16:27.609 --> 00:16:28.210
Are you okay?

00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:29.513
- Ah, you can just call me Nobu.

00:16:29.613 --> 00:16:32.018
I'm used to this crap from her.

00:16:32.118 --> 00:16:33.253
- We don't have much to offer
you,

00:16:33.354 --> 00:16:35.191
but you're totally welcome
to stay the night here

00:16:35.291 --> 00:16:36.159
if you want.

00:16:36.259 --> 00:16:37.328
- Oh, thank you!

00:16:37.428 --> 00:16:38.330
You're so sweet, Nana!

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:39.867
- [Nana Osaki] I didn't agree
to this. I'm not having it.

00:16:39.967 --> 00:16:41.804
- Nana! Why are you
acting like this, anyway?

00:16:41.904 --> 00:16:45.211
- It's for his own damn
good. He needs to smarten up.

00:16:45.311 --> 00:16:45.779
Listen, Nobu.

00:16:45.879 --> 00:16:47.783
You're gonna inherit that
humongous hotel

00:16:47.883 --> 00:16:49.019
when your parents retire.

00:16:49.119 --> 00:16:50.555
It's time you face reality.

00:16:50.656 --> 00:16:52.593
- [Nobu] I didn't ask to be
born into that family, you know.

00:16:52.693 --> 00:16:55.498
- Stop being such a
spoiled brat and grow up.

00:16:55.599 --> 00:16:57.402
You've got no idea how lucky you
are.

00:16:57.503 --> 00:16:58.337
You've got it made.

00:16:58.437 --> 00:16:59.907
You don't have to worry about
your future.

00:17:00.007 --> 00:17:02.780
And it makes me sick to see
you just throw it all away.

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:05.652
- If I did throw it
away, I wouldn't miss it.

00:17:05.752 --> 00:17:07.890
The only thing in my
life that makes me happy

00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:09.827
is playing my guitar.

00:17:11.463 --> 00:17:13.367
With you singing.

00:17:14.436 --> 00:17:15.872
You know that already.

00:17:15.972 --> 00:17:17.710
Don't make me say it again.

00:17:28.965 --> 00:17:29.767
- Listen, Nana.

00:17:29.867 --> 00:17:31.804
We should at least let him stay
the night.

00:17:31.904 --> 00:17:32.438
Don't you think?

00:17:32.539 --> 00:17:34.710
It's getting pretty late.

00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:35.812
Okay?

00:17:40.187 --> 00:17:40.922
(phone rings)

00:17:41.022 --> 00:17:41.557
Huh?

00:17:41.657 --> 00:17:42.860
Hey, whose phone is that?

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.462
- Oh, it's mine.

00:17:45.231 --> 00:17:46.066
Hello?

00:17:46.166 --> 00:17:47.368
Oh, Hey, Yasu.

00:17:47.468 --> 00:17:50.675
Yeah, just got here a few
minutes ago.

00:17:50.776 --> 00:17:51.243
- Yasu listen to me!

00:17:51.343 --> 00:17:53.013
I want you to do something
about this bone head.

00:17:53.113 --> 00:17:56.086
Why'd you let him bring my
stuff. What were you thinking?

00:17:56.186 --> 00:17:56.854
- Sorry, my bad.

00:17:56.954 --> 00:17:59.192
But he wouldn't take
no for an answer.

00:17:59.292 --> 00:18:00.161
- [Nana Osaki] That is so lame.

00:18:00.261 --> 00:18:01.564
What am I supposed to do?

00:18:01.664 --> 00:18:02.900
- Nothing you can do about it
now.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.970
Nobu's serious about this.

00:18:05.071 --> 00:18:07.075
Why don't the two of you
hunt for some new band mates

00:18:07.175 --> 00:18:09.379
and start over down there?

00:18:09.479 --> 00:18:12.452
Wouldn't you rather be
in a band than go solo?

00:18:12.553 --> 00:18:15.625
Besides you're a lot better
at writing lyrics than music.

00:18:15.725 --> 00:18:17.896
Speaking of which, have
you listened to the tape?

00:18:17.996 --> 00:18:19.165
- What tape?

00:18:19.265 --> 00:18:21.169
- The new song Nobu wrote.

00:18:21.269 --> 00:18:22.740
It's pretty good, you know?

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:24.744
And it's gonna be perfect for
your voice.

00:18:24.844 --> 00:18:28.985
Once you put some lyrics to
it, it's gonna rock and rule.

00:18:29.085 --> 00:18:29.954
- Hm...

00:18:30.054 --> 00:18:31.323
- Hm?

00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:37.703
(rock music)

00:18:52.966 --> 00:18:53.802
- Wow! This is awesome.

00:18:53.902 --> 00:18:56.306
I can't believe you
actually wrote this, Nobu.

00:18:56.406 --> 00:18:57.976
I'm totally blown away.

00:18:58.076 --> 00:18:58.945
- Huh?

00:18:59.045 --> 00:19:01.349
- [Nana Komatsu] Nana?

00:19:04.055 --> 00:19:05.357
- Play it.

00:19:05.458 --> 00:19:07.796
And I'll sing something.

00:19:08.665 --> 00:19:09.967
- Okay.

00:19:10.067 --> 00:19:11.871
Ah, my amps out in the car.

00:19:11.971 --> 00:19:13.440
I'll have to go get it.

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:16.246
So that's what was in there.

00:19:16.346 --> 00:19:18.651
No wonder that thing was so
heavy.

00:19:25.464 --> 00:19:26.868
- What's the deal?

00:19:26.968 --> 00:19:27.503
No one here.

00:19:27.603 --> 00:19:29.773
Don't tell me the only sold
one ticket to this gig.

00:19:29.874 --> 00:19:32.579
That sucks. Oh, well.

00:19:32.679 --> 00:19:34.617
We all gotta start somewhere.

00:19:34.717 --> 00:19:37.455
Guess one fan's better than
none.

00:19:37.556 --> 00:19:38.591
Hey, good evening.

00:19:38.691 --> 00:19:41.396
We're Blast and welcome
to our first show ever

00:19:41.496 --> 00:19:42.533
here in Tokyo.

00:19:42.633 --> 00:19:44.803
- Good evening, Blast.

00:19:44.904 --> 00:19:47.843
- We'll make this a night
you'll never forget.

00:19:50.381 --> 00:19:53.086
(rock music)

00:20:22.813 --> 00:20:24.617
- [Nana Komatsu] You were right.

00:20:24.717 --> 00:20:26.721
I've never forgotten that night.

00:20:28.123 --> 00:20:31.496
The song had no lyrics
so you just made them up

00:20:31.597 --> 00:20:33.066
using any words you could think
of,

00:20:33.166 --> 00:20:34.469
whether they made sense or not.

00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:35.639
♪ I need your love ♪

00:20:35.739 --> 00:20:38.578
- [Nana Komatsu] It's like
you put a crazy spell on me.

00:20:38.678 --> 00:20:42.084
You're haunting voice held
captive.

00:20:45.491 --> 00:20:48.397
♪ I need your love ♪

00:20:56.981 --> 00:20:59.653
- [Nana Komatsu] The kitchen
table was your stage.

00:20:59.753 --> 00:21:01.557
The cell phone was your mic

00:21:01.657 --> 00:21:04.797
and the crescent moon was your
spotlight.

00:21:04.897 --> 00:21:06.801
Nana, you're the only one in the
world

00:21:06.901 --> 00:21:09.740
that could make magic like that.

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:13.146
To this day, I still believe
that.

00:22:20.515 --> 00:22:23.487
(phone beeps)
