00:00:04.573 --> 00:00:06.811
- [Nana Osaki] Hey, Nana
Komatsu,

00:00:06.911 --> 00:00:09.215
Remember the first time we met?

00:00:09.315 --> 00:00:12.188
You know, I don't believe
in things like fate.

00:00:12.288 --> 00:00:16.029
So I'm thinking it was nothing
more than a coincidence.

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.868
(rock music)

00:01:54.225 --> 00:01:57.398
Hi, everyone, and
welcome to Junko's Place.

00:01:57.498 --> 00:01:59.469
- [Kyosuke and Shoji]
Hey, how's how's it going?

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:00.705
- Shouldn't it be Nana's place?

00:02:00.805 --> 00:02:02.174
- Nope. This is my place.

00:02:02.275 --> 00:02:04.245
I am the one who's in charge
here.

00:02:04.345 --> 00:02:04.847
- Yeah, sure you are.

00:02:04.947 --> 00:02:06.116
- And I gotta tell you guys,

00:02:06.216 --> 00:02:08.688
it's been a lot of hard
work on this show lately.

00:02:08.788 --> 00:02:10.057
- Even though you've
only got a small part.

00:02:10.157 --> 00:02:12.194
- And you know all about
having a small part.

00:02:12.295 --> 00:02:14.566
No, what's tiring me
out is Nana.

00:02:14.667 --> 00:02:16.570
She's why it's such hard work.

00:02:16.671 --> 00:02:17.271
- Oh, yeah?

00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:18.908
Who's the one who always
has to look out for her?

00:02:19.008 --> 00:02:20.411
Yeah, me. That's who.

00:02:20.512 --> 00:02:21.714
Ever since she came to Tokyo,

00:02:21.814 --> 00:02:24.419
she's been nothing but
a big pain in the butt.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.695
- [Nana] (giggles) Spring is
here. Spring is finally here!

00:02:28.795 --> 00:02:30.999
I've waited so long for this.

00:02:31.634 --> 00:02:32.134
- [Both] Huh?

00:02:32.234 --> 00:02:34.873
- Nana. She's on her way to
Tokyo.

00:02:34.974 --> 00:02:35.942
- [Both] What?!

00:02:36.042 --> 00:02:38.313
- One way ticket to Tokyo,
please.

00:02:39.282 --> 00:02:42.154
(Nana screaming)
(train screeching)

00:02:42.254 --> 00:02:45.094
(playful music)

00:02:45.194 --> 00:02:47.365
Okay, I think we should make a
toast.

00:02:47.465 --> 00:02:49.068
- Okay, to what?

00:02:50.505 --> 00:02:51.741
- Shoji passing his exam?

00:02:51.841 --> 00:02:54.379
- That's got nothing to do with
me.

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:57.151
- All right then, what
about a toast to you and me?

00:02:57.251 --> 00:02:58.353
- Yeah, I'll drink to that.

00:02:58.453 --> 00:03:00.190
A toast to two girls who are the
same age

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.629
who happen to be
going to Tokyo at the time,

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:04.198
stuck on the same train.

00:03:04.298 --> 00:03:07.539
Quite a coincidence, right?
And there's one more thing.

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:08.173
- Huh?

00:03:08.273 --> 00:03:11.547
- A toast to the fact that
both of us are called Nana.

00:03:13.518 --> 00:03:14.520
(cans clink)

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.926
(classical music)

00:03:22.803 --> 00:03:25.307
- Nana! It is you, isn't it?

00:03:25.407 --> 00:03:27.278
What a coincidence!

00:03:27.378 --> 00:03:28.881
- Who are you?

00:03:30.017 --> 00:03:31.787
- [Nana] Am I that forgettable?

00:03:31.887 --> 00:03:35.829
- (laughs) Sorry, sorry.
Are you all right, Nana?

00:03:35.929 --> 00:03:37.933
- [Nana] So you do remember me!

00:03:39.035 --> 00:03:43.443
(classical music)

00:03:43.544 --> 00:03:47.719
- Starting tomorrow, you and
I will be roommates, Nana.

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:51.126
(classical music)

00:04:02.281 --> 00:04:04.887
- Just what the hell
are you thinking anyway?

00:04:04.987 --> 00:04:05.454
- Why not?

00:04:05.555 --> 00:04:08.060
Sharing an apartment is what
foreigners do all the time.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.895
I bet it's lots of fun.

00:04:08.995 --> 00:04:10.799
- How could you be so naive,
Nana?

00:04:10.899 --> 00:04:12.636
You can't just move into an
apartment

00:04:12.736 --> 00:04:14.405
with some random stranger!

00:04:14.506 --> 00:04:18.013
- Nana, what in hell's name
did you think you were doing?

00:04:18.113 --> 00:04:22.088
All right, I've got it.
Let's live together, okay?

00:04:22.188 --> 00:04:23.090
- If we live together,

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.327
I'm scared you're gonna start
hating me.

00:04:25.427 --> 00:04:28.166
I can be a selfish,
spoiled brat sometimes.

00:04:28.266 --> 00:04:30.137
- Don't you think I know that
already?

00:04:30.237 --> 00:04:32.174
I'm definitely used to that by
now.

00:04:32.274 --> 00:04:34.178
- That's mean.
- I'm just kidding.

00:04:34.278 --> 00:04:36.249
So you want to do it, huh?

00:04:37.251 --> 00:04:38.353
- Shoji.

00:04:39.957 --> 00:04:41.459
Thank you for that.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.000
I'm glad to hear you say
it, but there's no way!

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.002
Now I've heard those words,

00:04:46.102 --> 00:04:48.306
I know how you really feel about
me.

00:04:48.406 --> 00:04:50.244
I know that you're picking
me over Sachiko

00:04:50.344 --> 00:04:52.281
- Who the hell's Sachiko?

00:04:52.381 --> 00:04:54.051
- The thing is you're too nice.

00:04:54.152 --> 00:04:55.989
And if we live together you'd
spoil me

00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:59.095
and I'd rely on you
for everything.

00:04:59.195 --> 00:05:02.067
I don't ever wanna become
a burden to you, Shoji.

00:05:02.168 --> 00:05:04.807
- (sighs) Nana's heart
is in the right place

00:05:04.907 --> 00:05:06.142
and she doesn't mean to
cause trouble,

00:05:06.242 --> 00:05:08.881
but sometimes she just
can't help getting herself

00:05:08.981 --> 00:05:10.150
into a big mess.

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.987
- But instead of being a
burden on us,

00:05:12.087 --> 00:05:14.526
she ended up finding someone
new, that other Nana.

00:05:14.626 --> 00:05:19.335
- Yeah, I know. But that's
how things go with our Nana.

00:05:19.435 --> 00:05:21.473
- Hey, Nana. Look at these
glasses, aren't they cute?

00:05:21.574 --> 00:05:24.312
I can't believe they're only
100 yen!

00:05:24.412 --> 00:05:26.617
- Little red strawberries?

00:05:26.717 --> 00:05:27.351
- No good?

00:05:27.451 --> 00:05:29.055
- If you want 'em, buy 'em.

00:05:29.155 --> 00:05:30.491
- Nah, I won't.
- Why not?

00:05:30.592 --> 00:05:32.428
- 'Cause if you don't like
them, I don't want them.

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:33.764
There's no point in me buying
them

00:05:33.865 --> 00:05:35.234
unless we're both gonna
use them.

00:05:35.334 --> 00:05:36.904
- I don't really care what
we use,

00:05:37.004 --> 00:05:39.108
let's just get the
shopping done.

00:05:39.208 --> 00:05:41.346
- But you don't like the
little red strawberries.

00:05:41.446 --> 00:05:45.622
- No, I love little red
strawberries. To eat.

00:05:45.722 --> 00:05:46.590
- Then let's get them, okay.

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.028
- [Nana Osaki] Now I can see
what Shoji has to deal with.

00:05:49.128 --> 00:05:49.630
- What do you mean?

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:52.969
- Well, you're kind of like a
puppy dog.

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:54.205
- I am?

00:05:54.305 --> 00:05:58.079
- Well, you're super
friendly, very obedient,

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.585
but you need a lot of attention.

00:06:00.685 --> 00:06:03.958
Works for me though. I was
thinking to get in a pet anyway.

00:06:04.058 --> 00:06:05.962
You want me to buy you
a little treat, Hachi?

00:06:06.062 --> 00:06:07.264
- Why Hachi?

00:06:07.364 --> 00:06:10.204
Couldn't you have picked
a cuter nickname for me?

00:06:10.304 --> 00:06:13.376
- (laughs) So your names
are Nana and Hachi?

00:06:13.476 --> 00:06:15.047
Seven and eight, great combo.

00:06:15.147 --> 00:06:16.049
- That's not really my name.

00:06:16.149 --> 00:06:17.451
You see, I'm called Nana as
well,

00:06:17.552 --> 00:06:19.155
but this Nana thought it was too
confusing

00:06:19.255 --> 00:06:20.357
for us both to have the same
name-

00:06:20.457 --> 00:06:22.027
- I thought it was 'cause
you're like that puppy

00:06:22.127 --> 00:06:23.731
called Hachiko.

00:06:23.831 --> 00:06:25.100
(puppy barks)

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.269
Beer. Want one?

00:06:26.369 --> 00:06:27.873
- Yeah.
- Are you kidding me?

00:06:27.973 --> 00:06:28.908
You gotta go to work.

00:06:29.008 --> 00:06:30.077
- But I'm really, really thirsty

00:06:30.177 --> 00:06:31.881
and I'm really, really
hungry too!

00:06:31.981 --> 00:06:33.718
And there's nothing to eat here!

00:06:33.818 --> 00:06:35.822
- That reminds me, that burger
you bought,

00:06:35.922 --> 00:06:37.458
it tasted really good.

00:06:37.559 --> 00:06:37.726
Thanks for that.

00:06:37.826 --> 00:06:39.997
- You ate the whole thing
on your own? No fair!

00:06:40.097 --> 00:06:43.370
- Then why'd you say it
was a present for me?

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:46.810
- [Nana] (gasps) Look at
that cute little bakery.

00:06:46.911 --> 00:06:48.581
(screams) What should I have?

00:06:48.681 --> 00:06:50.384
Oh, it all looks too good to be
true!

00:06:50.484 --> 00:06:53.958
- You really do seem
to have a keen sense of smell.

00:06:54.058 --> 00:06:56.029
Just like a dog.

00:06:56.129 --> 00:06:57.264
- Hey, Nana, can we just pop

00:06:57.364 --> 00:06:58.734
into that music store over
there?

00:06:58.834 --> 00:07:00.337
There's a CD I wanna get.

00:07:00.437 --> 00:07:03.443
- Yeah, sure. Do you have
a CD player?

00:07:03.544 --> 00:07:05.213
If you don't mind a little
portable thing,

00:07:05.314 --> 00:07:07.752
you can borrow mine.
- Thanks, Nana!

00:07:09.723 --> 00:07:11.694
How great is this? They have
some left.

00:07:11.794 --> 00:07:15.000
It's the latest Trapnest
album and it just got released.

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.137
They're my favorite band ever.

00:07:18.975 --> 00:07:20.545
(Nana Osaki shudders)

00:07:20.645 --> 00:07:22.281
You can listen to it whenever
you want.

00:07:22.381 --> 00:07:24.185
They're so cool. You're gonna
love it.

00:07:24.285 --> 00:07:26.289
Hang on a minute while I go pay.

00:07:26.991 --> 00:07:30.364
(melancholy music)

00:07:39.448 --> 00:07:43.256
- How do you like this? I
bought it off a street vendor.

00:07:43.356 --> 00:07:45.027
A Sid Vicious padlock.

00:07:45.127 --> 00:07:46.930
- [Ren] Does that mean you are
Nancy?

00:07:47.031 --> 00:07:48.099
- Hmm.

00:07:48.199 --> 00:07:50.505
- So you think you can walk me
up?

00:07:53.009 --> 00:07:53.978
- Hey, Ren.

00:07:54.078 --> 00:07:57.786
Tell me, if I was gonna die,
would you die along with me?

00:08:02.161 --> 00:08:03.898
- Yeah, I would.

00:08:03.998 --> 00:08:07.371
(melancholy music)

00:08:48.053 --> 00:08:50.625
- You know, there's
something about the other Nana.

00:08:50.725 --> 00:08:53.163
She's one of those women
who has a past.

00:08:53.263 --> 00:08:54.298
- [Kyosuke] I guess so.

00:08:54.398 --> 00:08:55.568
- You know what I think,

00:08:55.668 --> 00:08:57.371
I think the closer she
gets to the other Nana,

00:08:57.471 --> 00:08:59.408
the more distance there
is between the two of you

00:08:59.509 --> 00:09:00.945
and your relationship, Shoji.

00:09:01.045 --> 00:09:01.914
- Huh?!

00:09:02.014 --> 00:09:04.686
- You got that right.

00:09:04.786 --> 00:09:07.057
- [Junko] I was wondering
how you managed to find a job

00:09:07.157 --> 00:09:08.828
that fast, you big flirt.

00:09:08.928 --> 00:09:13.103
I didn't expect the
manager to be so young.

00:09:13.203 --> 00:09:15.374
- Koichi Sato, can I get
another burger?

00:09:15.474 --> 00:09:16.342
- [Koichi] Coming up?!

00:09:16.442 --> 00:09:17.946
- Well, it makes no
difference to me,

00:09:18.046 --> 00:09:20.350
but I guess as long as you do
your work and get paid for it,

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:22.154
it doesn't matter what your
motives are.

00:09:22.254 --> 00:09:23.791
Even if they are totally
out of whack.

00:09:23.891 --> 00:09:26.897
Just try not to freak
Shoji out too much, okay?

00:09:26.997 --> 00:09:27.599
When he was drunk last night,

00:09:27.699 --> 00:09:30.237
he started grumbling about
you again.

00:09:30.337 --> 00:09:32.942
- He was grumbling? And
he's done it more than once?

00:09:33.043 --> 00:09:34.746
- Well, I...

00:09:34.846 --> 00:09:35.548
- I knew it. I knew it!

00:09:35.648 --> 00:09:38.053
Shoji doesn't really like
me after all, does he?

00:09:38.153 --> 00:09:41.827
I'm a terrible girlfriend!
- No, It's not that. (sighs)

00:09:44.331 --> 00:09:45.434
Shoji just gets worried,

00:09:45.535 --> 00:09:48.541
but that's only because he
cares so much about you.

00:09:48.641 --> 00:09:49.643
There aren't many guys around

00:09:49.743 --> 00:09:53.149
who treat a girl that way,
you know?

00:09:53.249 --> 00:09:54.653
So you better treat him good

00:09:54.753 --> 00:09:57.257
or else fate will turn
against you.

00:09:59.896 --> 00:10:03.436
- Not again. Why are you
always working so much?

00:10:03.537 --> 00:10:05.541
Your parents send you money,
don't they?

00:10:05.641 --> 00:10:06.710
- The measly amount they send me

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:08.446
is nowhere near enough to live
on.

00:10:08.547 --> 00:10:11.119
And once school starts, I
won't have as much time to work.

00:10:11.219 --> 00:10:13.323
So I gotta put in as
many hours as I can now

00:10:13.423 --> 00:10:14.125
to save up some cash.

00:10:14.225 --> 00:10:17.097
- You're spending it all on
your other girlfriend, Sachiko.

00:10:17.197 --> 00:10:19.168
Designer bags, designer shoes.

00:10:19.268 --> 00:10:20.905
- Yeah, she's got expensive
taste.

00:10:21.005 --> 00:10:21.573
(Nana gasps)

00:10:21.673 --> 00:10:24.746
I'm joking, I'm joking! You're
the one who started it all.

00:10:24.846 --> 00:10:25.948
- Yeah, but when I moved
all the way to Tokyo,

00:10:26.048 --> 00:10:28.687
it was to be with you, and
now I hardly ever see you.

00:10:28.788 --> 00:10:30.892
You're always working day in,
day out.

00:10:30.992 --> 00:10:33.496
I just wish you'd make some
time for me, that's all.

00:10:33.597 --> 00:10:36.035
- Maybe you should try
to consider how I feel.

00:10:36.135 --> 00:10:37.705
Why should I be the one who has
to work

00:10:37.806 --> 00:10:40.277
around your schedule all the
time?

00:10:41.412 --> 00:10:46.322
(sighs)
(melancholy music)

00:10:46.422 --> 00:10:48.493
I gotta go to work now.

00:10:50.631 --> 00:10:52.401
Oh, I just remembered.

00:10:52.502 --> 00:10:55.173
Did you text message me last
night?

00:10:55.273 --> 00:10:57.110
- Huh?

00:10:57.211 --> 00:11:00.217
- No biggie. Guess it
wasn't anything important.

00:11:00.317 --> 00:11:03.591
I must have fallen asleep and
didn't hear the phone beep.

00:11:03.691 --> 00:11:04.726
Sorry.

00:11:07.966 --> 00:11:10.137
- [Nana] Did I text him
last night?

00:11:10.237 --> 00:11:11.540
What did I write?

00:11:12.809 --> 00:11:15.113
(gasps)

00:11:15.213 --> 00:11:18.587
(melancholy music)

00:11:42.234 --> 00:11:42.836
(Shoji groans)

00:11:42.936 --> 00:11:44.706
- Come on, what's with
all the doom and gloom?

00:11:44.806 --> 00:11:46.275
- She's right, relax a little.

00:11:46.375 --> 00:11:49.081
You gotta expect love to
have its ups and downs.

00:11:49.181 --> 00:11:50.618
- Oh my God, I forgot to tell
you!

00:11:50.718 --> 00:11:52.555
The other Nana's putting a band
together.

00:11:52.655 --> 00:11:53.924
She's a real
singer.

00:11:54.024 --> 00:11:57.599
- Yeah, it's kind of cool.
Don't you think?

00:11:57.699 --> 00:11:59.502
- What made you choose a lotus
blossom?

00:11:59.603 --> 00:12:00.872
Does it have a special meaning?

00:12:00.972 --> 00:12:03.376
- Actually, it's not a
lotus. It's a ren flower.

00:12:03.476 --> 00:12:05.982
- Huh? You mean like a
water lily?

00:12:06.082 --> 00:12:07.050
- No, it's just a ren.

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:08.286
- So it is a lotus, then?

00:12:08.386 --> 00:12:09.421
- No, it's not a lotus.

00:12:09.522 --> 00:12:11.292
- I'm pretty sure it's
called a lotus flower.

00:12:11.392 --> 00:12:12.461
- Just drop it, okay?

00:12:12.562 --> 00:12:14.298
- But it's totally a lotus
flower.

00:12:14.398 --> 00:12:15.635
Man, why are you so stubborn?

00:12:15.735 --> 00:12:17.639
- Right back at ya!
(doorbell rings)

00:12:17.739 --> 00:12:20.912
- Huh? Who could be dropping
by this late?

00:12:24.619 --> 00:12:26.957
(Nana Osaki shudders)

00:12:27.057 --> 00:12:29.028
- Good evening!

00:12:29.128 --> 00:12:31.533
- Nobu! What the hell are you
doing here?!

00:12:31.633 --> 00:12:32.635
- Haha, yes. Nice!

00:12:32.735 --> 00:12:35.808
The welcome I always wanted!
Yeah.

00:12:35.908 --> 00:12:37.979
- Go back to where you came
from!

00:12:38.079 --> 00:12:39.315
- Nana, please listen.

00:12:39.415 --> 00:12:41.185
You gotta let me stay for
just one night!

00:12:41.285 --> 00:12:42.387
- No chance.
- Yeah, but I-

00:12:42.487 --> 00:12:44.526
- I don't wanna hear it.
- I ran away from home.

00:12:44.626 --> 00:12:46.295
- I told you I don't wanna hear
it.

00:12:46.395 --> 00:12:48.567
- Nana!
- It's for his own good.

00:12:48.667 --> 00:12:49.669
He needs to smarten up.

00:12:49.769 --> 00:12:52.140
Listen, Nobu, you're gonna
inherit that humongous hotel

00:12:52.241 --> 00:12:55.080
when your parents retire,
it's time you face reality.

00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:57.117
- [Nobu] I didn't ask to be
born into that family, you know?

00:12:57.217 --> 00:12:59.823
- Stop being such a
spoiled brat and grow up.

00:12:59.923 --> 00:13:02.060
- The only thing in my
life that makes me happy

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:03.864
is playing my guitar.

00:13:04.666 --> 00:13:07.004
with you singing.

00:13:07.104 --> 00:13:10.678
You know that already.
Don't make me say it again.

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:14.118
- [Nana Osaki] Yasu, listen to
me!

00:13:14.218 --> 00:13:16.556
I want you to do something
about this bonehead.

00:13:16.657 --> 00:13:17.625
- [Yasu] Sorry, my bad,

00:13:17.725 --> 00:13:18.927
but he wouldn't take no for an
answer.

00:13:19.028 --> 00:13:20.263
- [Nana Osaki] That is so
lame.

00:13:20.363 --> 00:13:21.566
What am I supposed to do?!

00:13:21.667 --> 00:13:23.504
- Nothing you can do about it
now.

00:13:23.604 --> 00:13:24.906
Nobu's serious about
this.

00:13:25.006 --> 00:13:27.277
Why don't the two of you
hunt for some new band mates

00:13:27.377 --> 00:13:29.448
and start over down there?

00:13:29.549 --> 00:13:31.820
Have you listened to the tape?

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:32.956
- What tape?

00:13:33.056 --> 00:13:36.530
- The new song Nobu wrote.
It's pretty good, you know?

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:38.399
And it's gonna be perfect
for your voice.

00:13:38.499 --> 00:13:42.441
Once you put some lyrics to
it, it's gonna rock and roll.

00:13:42.542 --> 00:13:43.376
(Nana Osaki groans)

00:13:43.476 --> 00:13:46.215
(rock music)

00:13:53.597 --> 00:13:55.266
- What's the deal? No one here?

00:13:55.367 --> 00:13:58.072
Don't tell me the only sold
one ticket to this gig.

00:13:58.172 --> 00:13:58.841
That sucks.

00:13:58.941 --> 00:14:02.582
Oh, well, we all gotta start
somewhere.

00:14:02.682 --> 00:14:05.588
Guess one fan's better
than none.

00:14:05.688 --> 00:14:07.625
Hey, good evening. We're Blast.

00:14:07.725 --> 00:14:11.198
And welcome to our first
show ever here in Tokyo.

00:14:11.298 --> 00:14:12.568
- Good evening, Blast.

00:14:12.669 --> 00:14:16.075
- We'll make this a night
you'll never forget.

00:14:16.175 --> 00:14:17.244
(Nana gasps)

00:14:17.344 --> 00:14:20.083
(rock music)

00:14:27.932 --> 00:14:33.544
(rock music)
(singing in foreign language)

00:15:16.262 --> 00:15:21.138
- I was looking at the flyer
you've got in the window.

00:15:34.866 --> 00:15:40.276
(bass guitar ringing)
(Nana Osaki gasping)

00:15:45.588 --> 00:15:47.124
- Huh?

00:15:47.224 --> 00:15:47.959
- Ow!

00:15:48.059 --> 00:15:49.896
- Nana!
- Oh, man. Sorry guys.

00:15:49.996 --> 00:15:50.965
Did I screw up or something?

00:15:51.065 --> 00:15:53.637
- Nah, dude, not at
all. You're doing great.

00:15:53.737 --> 00:15:55.473
Way better than we expected.

00:15:55.574 --> 00:15:56.576
What do you say, Nana?

00:15:56.676 --> 00:15:58.747
He's good, right?
Let's let him join.

00:15:58.847 --> 00:16:00.985
- [Nana Osaki] So, it's
Shinichi, right?

00:16:01.085 --> 00:16:02.154
- That's right.

00:16:02.254 --> 00:16:04.726
- Tell me who your
favorite bass player is.

00:16:04.826 --> 00:16:06.596
- Ren Honjo!

00:16:06.696 --> 00:16:08.266
- Hm.
(Nobu sighs)

00:16:08.366 --> 00:16:11.138
(dramatic sting)

00:16:11.238 --> 00:16:14.846
- Before you say yes, I want
you to promise me one thing.

00:16:14.946 --> 00:16:18.887
And if you can't promise to
do it, you have to split now.

00:16:18.987 --> 00:16:22.093
Play better than Ren, all right?

00:16:24.164 --> 00:16:26.603
- [Shinichi] Yes, ma'am.
Your wish is my command.

00:16:26.703 --> 00:16:29.475
(rock music)

00:16:29.576 --> 00:16:30.544
- Isn't this great?

00:16:30.644 --> 00:16:33.115
I never expect us to
find someone this fast.

00:16:33.216 --> 00:16:34.251
And he's so cute.

00:16:34.351 --> 00:16:36.823
And who discovered him?
Who's one made it happen?

00:16:36.923 --> 00:16:39.696
- What do you want me
to do? Bake you a cake?

00:16:39.796 --> 00:16:41.065
How else can I thank you?

00:16:41.165 --> 00:16:43.737
- Hey, don't throw that
on the ground. Honestly!

00:16:43.837 --> 00:16:45.841
- Well, thank you, Hachiko.

00:16:46.475 --> 00:16:49.281
(rock music)

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.264
- I thought you said
you weren't into girls.

00:16:57.364 --> 00:16:59.234
You can't just do that to me,
and besides,

00:16:59.334 --> 00:17:01.405
I have a boyfriend.
- What a drama queen.

00:17:01.506 --> 00:17:02.542
It was just a kiss.

00:17:02.642 --> 00:17:05.180
I mean, it's not like
she's a virgin.

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:08.019
(rock music)

00:17:10.256 --> 00:17:11.091
Now that we're home,

00:17:11.192 --> 00:17:13.897
you should thank your mom
for that money.

00:17:14.666 --> 00:17:16.770
- Yeah, I'll call her later.

00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:17.572
- Oh, I see.

00:17:17.672 --> 00:17:19.007
You don't wanna call 'cause
you're afraid

00:17:19.107 --> 00:17:21.245
you'll start crying when
you hear mommy's voice.

00:17:21.345 --> 00:17:24.686
- No! Well, maybe I do get
a little homesick sometimes.

00:17:24.786 --> 00:17:26.121
Don't you ever feel that way?

00:17:26.222 --> 00:17:27.825
- Nope, it's hard
to get home sick

00:17:27.925 --> 00:17:29.796
when you don't have a home.

00:17:31.265 --> 00:17:31.465
- What's up with you?

00:17:31.566 --> 00:17:35.574
You don't always have to
try and act cool around me.

00:17:35.674 --> 00:17:38.914
(rock music)

00:17:39.014 --> 00:17:41.151
(gasps)

00:17:43.055 --> 00:17:46.830
(rock music continues)

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:04.766
- Yasu, we need you.

00:18:04.866 --> 00:18:07.905
Blast isn't the same
without you.

00:18:08.005 --> 00:18:11.513
- Yeah, I've been too
worried to sleep.

00:18:11.613 --> 00:18:15.086
There are lots of law
firms right here in Tokyo.

00:18:16.355 --> 00:18:19.094
(rock music)

00:18:26.876 --> 00:18:29.381
- [Nana Osaki] Thank you!

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:34.258
- Getting to hear the other
Nana sing for the first time,

00:18:34.358 --> 00:18:36.997
managing to find a new member of
the band.

00:18:37.097 --> 00:18:39.535
Seems like there's
something new happening to Nana

00:18:39.636 --> 00:18:40.838
every single day, doesn't it?

00:18:40.938 --> 00:18:42.642
- Yeah, and I bet Shoji feels

00:18:42.742 --> 00:18:45.446
like he's been left out of
everything, isn't that right?

00:18:45.547 --> 00:18:48.854
Oh, but now you got Sachiko to
keep you company, don't you?

00:18:48.954 --> 00:18:52.360
- Right, right, and this
Sachiko is real.

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:55.834
- I'm Sachiko Kawamura.
It's nice to meet you.

00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:57.772
- What was your name?

00:18:57.872 --> 00:19:00.076
- Sachiko.

00:19:00.176 --> 00:19:03.416
- Really? Do you like
designer bags and shoes?

00:19:03.517 --> 00:19:05.053
- Huh?
- So that's how it is.

00:19:05.153 --> 00:19:08.125
- I know, it's a crazy
coincidence, huh?

00:19:08.225 --> 00:19:09.762
- You work at the same
restaurant.

00:19:09.862 --> 00:19:11.098
You go to the same school.

00:19:11.198 --> 00:19:12.868
You even got the same major.

00:19:12.969 --> 00:19:14.806
I bet you two get along great.

00:19:14.906 --> 00:19:16.576
- Yeah, but Sachiko
passed the entrance exam

00:19:16.676 --> 00:19:18.613
on her first try, so she's
a couple years younger.

00:19:18.714 --> 00:19:19.582
- Sachiko.
- Yeah.

00:19:19.682 --> 00:19:22.688
She keeps wanting to hang out
with me and stuff like that.

00:19:22.788 --> 00:19:23.389
It'd be rude to say no.

00:19:23.489 --> 00:19:25.326
- You know, she's
definitely the type of girl

00:19:25.426 --> 00:19:28.432
you normally go for,
kind of petite and pale.

00:19:28.533 --> 00:19:29.301
Whatever, stuff happens.

00:19:29.401 --> 00:19:30.638
- Hey, it's not like that
between us.

00:19:30.738 --> 00:19:34.512
- Right, good for you for
having the self control.

00:19:34.612 --> 00:19:36.583
Uh-oh, here she comes.

00:19:36.683 --> 00:19:39.021
- Hey, coffee okay for you,
Shoji?

00:19:39.121 --> 00:19:40.156
- [Shoji] Sure. Thanks

00:19:40.256 --> 00:19:43.697
- Mr. Kyosuke, which one
of these do you want?

00:19:43.797 --> 00:19:46.503
- Just call me Kyosuke, Sachiko.

00:19:47.938 --> 00:19:49.676
She's seriously bad news, man.

00:19:49.776 --> 00:19:53.049
But even I think she's cute
and could probably go for her.

00:19:53.149 --> 00:19:56.121
This is definitely bad.

00:19:56.221 --> 00:20:01.966
(ringing)
(Sachiko and Shoji panting)

00:20:04.839 --> 00:20:08.446
- (exclaims) Oh, my shoe! Shoji!

00:20:08.547 --> 00:20:09.047
- Huh?

00:20:09.147 --> 00:20:12.187
- Go on without me. I lost my
shoe.

00:20:12.287 --> 00:20:13.289
- But...

00:20:19.602 --> 00:20:22.908
(train whooshing)

00:20:28.954 --> 00:20:31.760
(melancholy music)

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:34.799
You knew we were gonna have to
run to catch the last train,

00:20:34.899 --> 00:20:37.270
so why'd you wear shoes like
that?

00:20:38.774 --> 00:20:42.147
(melancholy music)

00:20:47.057 --> 00:20:48.727
- I did it on purpose.

00:20:48.827 --> 00:20:49.929
- [Shoji] Huh?

00:20:50.029 --> 00:20:50.697
(Shoji groans)

00:20:50.798 --> 00:20:53.937
- I knew this was gonna be
bad. I did it on purpose?

00:20:54.037 --> 00:20:57.143
- Yeah, she's got you
whipped. I did it on purpose?

00:20:57.243 --> 00:21:00.183
- [Both] So, how are you
getting outta this this one?

00:21:00.283 --> 00:21:01.452
- Well, that's all folks.

00:21:01.553 --> 00:21:02.955
Hope you and enjoyed your first
episode

00:21:03.055 --> 00:21:05.059
here at Junko's Place, we
sure did.

00:21:05.159 --> 00:21:06.596
- Well, hold on, first
episode?

00:21:06.696 --> 00:21:08.499
You mean there's gonna be more
than one?

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:09.267
- Wait and
see.

00:21:09.367 --> 00:21:10.436
It all depends on what secret
plans

00:21:10.537 --> 00:21:12.708
the demon lord has in
store for us.

00:21:12.808 --> 00:21:14.010
Bye-bye, everyone.

00:21:14.111 --> 00:21:15.914
- [Kyosuke and Shoji] See you
later.
