WEBVTT

00:00:02.839 --> 00:00:05.477
(water burbling)
- If I died now,

00:00:05.578 --> 00:00:08.350
I don't think Ren would
die with me anymore.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.458
But that's good.

00:00:13.326 --> 00:00:16.132
That's the way it should be.

00:00:16.232 --> 00:00:19.673
I must be crazy for
thinking that's sad.

00:02:09.125 --> 00:02:12.498
(knocking on door)

00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:14.201
- Sorry to bother you!

00:02:14.302 --> 00:02:16.205
I'm from the room next door.

00:02:16.306 --> 00:02:17.107
(eerie sound effect)

00:02:17.207 --> 00:02:20.013
- I think she's
hyperventilating.

00:02:20.113 --> 00:02:21.149
- I was wondering,

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:23.821
do you have a plastic or
paper bag I could use?

00:02:23.921 --> 00:02:25.357
- You don't have one?

00:02:26.927 --> 00:02:28.931
A paper bag works best.

00:02:29.031 --> 00:02:31.102
If you don't use a plastic bag
right,

00:02:31.202 --> 00:02:32.872
you could make things
worse for her.

00:02:32.972 --> 00:02:34.408
- Uh... really?

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:36.513
How should I get her
to use it, anyway?

00:02:36.613 --> 00:02:39.485
I mean, she's never
hyperventilated before.

00:02:39.586 --> 00:02:41.356
You seem to know a lot about
this.

00:02:41.456 --> 00:02:44.228
Can someone who's not a doctor
do this?

00:02:44.328 --> 00:02:46.867
- Yeah, I do it by myself.

00:02:48.303 --> 00:02:50.073
It's best if you get
her to lie on her back

00:02:50.173 --> 00:02:52.277
and then loosely cover her nose
and mouth

00:02:52.378 --> 00:02:54.215
with the opening of the bag.

00:02:54.315 --> 00:02:57.187
(melancholy music)
Like this.

00:02:59.058 --> 00:03:00.762
Have her take a deep breath.

00:03:00.862 --> 00:03:03.366
(inhaling deeply)

00:03:03.466 --> 00:03:06.272
It'll make her feel better.

00:03:08.778 --> 00:03:10.213
- It's a living hell.

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:14.623
- Thanks. I'll try it out.

00:03:14.723 --> 00:03:17.996
- I don't think you have to
freak out.

00:03:18.096 --> 00:03:19.465
That guy who's in
there with her,

00:03:19.566 --> 00:03:22.137
he seems kind of like a
tranquilizer.

00:03:22.237 --> 00:03:23.741
- Tranquilizer?

00:03:23.841 --> 00:03:27.047
- I was jealous before,
so I was mean to her.

00:03:27.147 --> 00:03:29.218
Tell her I'm sorry.

00:03:33.627 --> 00:03:34.261
(Nana breathing erratically)

00:03:34.361 --> 00:03:36.734
- I finally started
breathing again.

00:03:36.834 --> 00:03:40.742
It was like I was dragged up
from the bottom of the seat.

00:03:42.044 --> 00:03:44.215
Yasu's chest smelled sweet.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.787
Like Blast cigarettes.

00:03:48.724 --> 00:03:50.561
- I'm not going anywhere.

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:54.770
(water burbling)

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.243
(tires screeching)

00:04:00.581 --> 00:04:02.886
- Hey, Ginpei, how you doing?
- Where's Nana?

00:04:02.986 --> 00:04:03.921
- Room 602.

00:04:04.021 --> 00:04:04.856
- How is she doing?

00:04:04.956 --> 00:04:06.994
Did you call Dr. Azuma?

00:04:07.094 --> 00:04:07.896
- Take it easy.

00:04:07.996 --> 00:04:10.233
She's probably just
hyperventilating.

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:12.137
The same thing as what
happened to Miu.

00:04:12.237 --> 00:04:16.947
(Ginpei gasps)
(mysterious music)

00:04:17.047 --> 00:04:19.653
- [Ginpei] That's horrible.

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.069
- [Nana] The security guard
didn't call an ambulance.

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:30.340
He called the agency.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.179
Ginpei rushed over and
drove me to a hospital

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:35.283
where there was a
doctor the agency knew.

00:04:35.383 --> 00:04:37.589
(melancholy music)

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:38.757
By the time we got there,

00:04:38.858 --> 00:04:39.458
it was pretty late

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:42.231
and I was back to normal,

00:04:42.331 --> 00:04:45.303
but they gave me a
checkup just in case.

00:04:49.211 --> 00:04:50.447
- Hyperkinetic syndrome.

00:04:50.548 --> 00:04:52.417
Usually, we call it
hyperventilation.

00:04:52.519 --> 00:04:54.021
- So what does that mean?

00:04:54.121 --> 00:04:55.223
- It's like the word indicates.

00:04:55.323 --> 00:04:56.527
When you breathe too much, too
quickly,

00:04:56.627 --> 00:04:59.165
the level of carbon
dioxide in your blood decreases,

00:04:59.265 --> 00:05:00.233
causing the attack.

00:05:00.333 --> 00:05:02.539
- The level of carbon dioxide
in my blood?

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:04.843
- Nana, please be quiet
and listen.

00:05:04.943 --> 00:05:05.711
- Your attack subsided

00:05:05.812 --> 00:05:07.314
while breathing into
the paper bag

00:05:07.414 --> 00:05:09.351
because you were inhaling
carbon dioxide.

00:05:09.451 --> 00:05:11.422
This is called the
paper bag method, which-

00:05:11.523 --> 00:05:13.994
- Hey doc, I don't need
all the details, 'kay?

00:05:14.094 --> 00:05:16.032
Just tell me what my problem is.

00:05:16.132 --> 00:05:16.900
Is it my lungs?

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.802
- Well, no.

00:05:17.902 --> 00:05:18.504
- Then is it my blood?

00:05:18.604 --> 00:05:19.371
- Your blood's fine.

00:05:19.471 --> 00:05:21.510
- Then it must be
because I smoked

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:22.579
when I was still on the pill.

00:05:22.679 --> 00:05:24.415
But I thought that
when you're young,

00:05:24.516 --> 00:05:25.952
a little bit is all right.

00:05:26.052 --> 00:05:26.687
- A little.

00:05:26.787 --> 00:05:27.956
- It isn't good for your health.

00:05:28.056 --> 00:05:30.227
You run the risk of
getting thrombosis.

00:05:30.327 --> 00:05:31.295
- I know, I know.

00:05:31.395 --> 00:05:33.266
But I just can't stop myself.

00:05:33.366 --> 00:05:34.034
I'm hopeless.

00:05:34.134 --> 00:05:36.405
- Maybe he could take
on the responsibility

00:05:36.507 --> 00:05:37.809
for the contraception.

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:39.278
- Uh, I'm not...

00:05:39.378 --> 00:05:41.349
(Nana gasps)

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:43.988
- No, Dr. Azuma. You've
got it all wrong.

00:05:44.088 --> 00:05:45.791
Yasu belongs to me!

00:05:45.892 --> 00:05:46.693
- Oh, excuse me.

00:05:46.793 --> 00:05:49.365
In any case, nothing bad
showed up in your examination.

00:05:49.465 --> 00:05:51.235
So there's no need to worry.

00:05:51.335 --> 00:05:52.137
- What?!

00:05:52.237 --> 00:05:53.206
I was in so much pain,

00:05:53.306 --> 00:05:53.941
I thought I'd die!

00:05:54.041 --> 00:05:56.445
Did you examine me
properly, you quack?

00:05:56.547 --> 00:05:57.281
- Nana...

00:05:57.381 --> 00:05:58.918
- No need to get
upset, Miss Osaki.

00:05:59.018 --> 00:06:02.157
Hyperventilation can be
caused by strenuous exercise,

00:06:02.257 --> 00:06:05.397
or it can also occur when you're
feeling anxious or nervous.

00:06:05.497 --> 00:06:07.502
- But Dr. Ozuma, what
are we supposed to do

00:06:07.602 --> 00:06:09.873
if she's always like that?

00:06:09.973 --> 00:06:11.042
(Nana sighs)

00:06:11.142 --> 00:06:11.977
- How can I get better?

00:06:12.077 --> 00:06:15.718
- Well, we have no idea if
an attack will happen again.

00:06:15.818 --> 00:06:17.989
It's best just not to
worry about it.

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:18.891
- (gasps) That's impossible.

00:06:18.991 --> 00:06:20.928
There's no way I can't
worry about it.

00:06:21.028 --> 00:06:22.331
I mean, I'm a singer.

00:06:22.431 --> 00:06:23.399
When we play live shows,

00:06:23.499 --> 00:06:25.805
I move around a lot and
it is strenuous.

00:06:25.905 --> 00:06:28.076
I just can't risk having
another attack

00:06:28.176 --> 00:06:29.178
when I'm on stage.

00:06:29.278 --> 00:06:30.815
Please do something!

00:06:30.915 --> 00:06:33.954
- Well, as this is a
stress-related problem,

00:06:34.054 --> 00:06:36.392
it really is outside
of my field.

00:06:36.492 --> 00:06:37.762
If you're concerned about this,

00:06:37.862 --> 00:06:40.100
then I suggest you see
a psychiatrist.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:40.768
(Nana gasps)

00:06:40.868 --> 00:06:41.703
I'll write you a referral if you
like.

00:06:41.803 --> 00:06:43.741
- A psychiatrist?
- Very nice, Dr. Azuma!

00:06:43.841 --> 00:06:46.546
You always take such good care
of us!

00:06:49.519 --> 00:06:52.457
(Nobu sighs)

00:06:53.459 --> 00:06:54.896
(Shinichi gasps)

00:06:54.996 --> 00:06:56.399
- She's coming out.

00:06:58.604 --> 00:07:00.106
- What the hell are you two
doing here?

00:07:00.206 --> 00:07:02.210
- I see you're back to normal.
(Yasu chuckles)

00:07:02.311 --> 00:07:05.183
- Nana, are you
feeling all right?

00:07:05.283 --> 00:07:06.586
What did the doctor say?

00:07:06.687 --> 00:07:07.421
(cheerful sound effect)

00:07:07.522 --> 00:07:09.124
- Well, we already knew that I'm
nuts.

00:07:09.224 --> 00:07:11.663
(Nana cries out in pain)

00:07:11.763 --> 00:07:12.899
- That hurt, man!

00:07:12.999 --> 00:07:13.534
- Yeah, right.

00:07:13.634 --> 00:07:14.836
Your skull is way too thick.

00:07:14.936 --> 00:07:16.807
It won't even crack.
- Don't hit me!

00:07:16.907 --> 00:07:18.978
- It's a symptom of
these modern times.

00:07:19.078 --> 00:07:21.817
Everyone has to deal with
varying degrees of stress.

00:07:21.917 --> 00:07:24.121
We're living in a messed
up world.

00:07:24.221 --> 00:07:24.623
(somber music)

00:07:24.723 --> 00:07:25.791
You are just more
sensitive than other people

00:07:25.891 --> 00:07:28.496
and there's nothing
wrong with that.

00:07:32.437 --> 00:07:37.715
- [Nana] But I hate myself
whenever I'm weak like this.

00:07:39.151 --> 00:07:43.092
I can't stand being
who I am anymore.

00:07:43.192 --> 00:07:46.667
So why are these guys
not giving up on me?

00:07:48.637 --> 00:07:50.040
They have guts.

00:07:57.622 --> 00:07:58.624
- Aw man, we just got back,

00:07:58.724 --> 00:08:00.193
so how come we have
so much work to?

00:08:00.293 --> 00:08:04.536
- Because going to the UK
wasn't in our schedule.

00:08:04.636 --> 00:08:06.405
Now stop whining.
- Sorry about that.

00:08:06.506 --> 00:08:09.111
- No, it's not your fault at
all, Ren,

00:08:09.211 --> 00:08:10.313
'cause I really don't think

00:08:10.413 --> 00:08:12.785
we had to go all the way to the
UK.

00:08:13.386 --> 00:08:15.156
Huh?

00:08:15.256 --> 00:08:15.791
What are you doing?

00:08:15.891 --> 00:08:17.528
Get your filthy hands off of
that!

00:08:17.628 --> 00:08:18.697
- Filthy?

00:08:18.797 --> 00:08:22.371
My lighter just died and
that is a lighter, isn't it?

00:08:22.471 --> 00:08:23.607
(Reira gasps)

00:08:23.707 --> 00:08:24.843
- What?
- That thing's really a lighter?

00:08:24.943 --> 00:08:26.546
Wow. It's so freaking big!

00:08:26.646 --> 00:08:27.481
- Dumbass.

00:08:27.582 --> 00:08:29.652
When you saw Shin using
it at the after party,

00:08:29.753 --> 00:08:31.355
you said the exact same thing.

00:08:31.455 --> 00:08:33.259
Don't you remember?

00:08:33.359 --> 00:08:34.929
- Huh? Shin from Blast?

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:37.869
- He said it was a rare
collectors' item.

00:08:37.969 --> 00:08:38.469
- Is that right?

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:41.442
Well, I hope that lighter
you've got there isn't Shin's.

00:08:41.543 --> 00:08:42.010
- It's not his.

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:43.947
- Then why are you
carrying around a lighter

00:08:44.048 --> 00:08:45.818
everywhere you go when
you don't even smoke?

00:08:45.918 --> 00:08:47.789
- A fan gave it to me and I like
it, okay?

00:08:47.889 --> 00:08:49.859
- It's no fair that you
get such cool stuff.

00:08:49.959 --> 00:08:51.429
I only get stuffed animals.

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:52.598
My whole room's full of them.

00:08:52.698 --> 00:08:54.201
You actually keep
all that stuff?

00:08:54.301 --> 00:08:55.705
- Ren, gimme your lighter.

00:08:55.805 --> 00:08:58.443
(phone chimes)
(Reira gasps)

00:08:58.544 --> 00:09:02.117
(gentle downbeat music)

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:15.778
- [Nana] Saying I was
busy was just an excuse.

00:09:15.878 --> 00:09:18.617
I think Ren was in the same
boat,

00:09:18.717 --> 00:09:20.588
but I was scared that if
I heard his voice

00:09:20.688 --> 00:09:23.226
I might have another one
of those attacks.

00:09:24.662 --> 00:09:26.666
It really sucked.

00:09:26.767 --> 00:09:27.769
(upbeat rock music)
- Good morning, everyone.

00:09:27.869 --> 00:09:30.006
All right. Here's the schedule
for today.

00:09:30.106 --> 00:09:32.545
This morning, you are gonna
be doing a promo shoot-

00:09:32.645 --> 00:09:33.947
- Porno?
- A promo shoot.

00:09:34.047 --> 00:09:35.350
- For the studio.
- Oh.

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:36.820
In the afternoon,

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.624
we've got three music magazine
interviews

00:09:38.724 --> 00:09:39.592
and I'd like to remind you

00:09:39.692 --> 00:09:41.997
to please be professional
at all times.

00:09:42.097 --> 00:09:44.869
We always wanna leave
a good impression.

00:09:44.969 --> 00:09:46.238
I know you're supposed to
be rebels,

00:09:46.338 --> 00:09:48.409
but remember that's
just your image.

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:51.182
Also, if you get any questions
about your private life,

00:09:51.282 --> 00:09:52.184
just don't answer them.

00:09:52.284 --> 00:09:53.954
At seven, we'll meet
at Gaia's head office

00:09:54.054 --> 00:09:56.560
with the event organizers
about the outdoor shows.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:59.933
At nine, we've got practice
at the Kagudazaka studio.

00:10:00.033 --> 00:10:02.672
How long that'll take
depends on Matsuo's mood.

00:10:02.772 --> 00:10:04.776
And that's about all we've got
for today.

00:10:04.876 --> 00:10:06.780
It's not as packed as I thought.

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:07.949
- Not as packed as you thought?

00:10:08.049 --> 00:10:09.786
Nana's still recovering,
you know!

00:10:09.886 --> 00:10:11.088
- Not a problem at all.

00:10:11.188 --> 00:10:12.792
- Then let's hit it.

00:10:12.892 --> 00:10:15.263
We can eat breakfast
while we're in the car.

00:10:15.363 --> 00:10:16.633
- Hell yeah. I'm starving.

00:10:16.733 --> 00:10:19.672
The busier I was,
the better I felt.

00:10:21.843 --> 00:10:23.312
- This is your stylist, Masaru.

00:10:23.412 --> 00:10:25.216
- How you guys doing?
- Nice to meet you.

00:10:25.316 --> 00:10:26.620
- [Nana] When we were
totally immersed in work,

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:27.788
I felt good.

00:10:27.889 --> 00:10:31.630
So I didn't think I needed
to see a psychiatrist.

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:33.466
- I'm not gonna change your
image much.

00:10:33.567 --> 00:10:35.336
You've already got a distinct
style.

00:10:35.436 --> 00:10:36.038
- That's for sure!

00:10:36.138 --> 00:10:37.842
Bondage will be the new "in"
thing!

00:10:37.942 --> 00:10:39.011
(energetic rock music)

00:10:39.111 --> 00:10:40.681
- [Nana] There were so
many people involved

00:10:40.781 --> 00:10:42.484
in the release of our
debut single.

00:10:42.585 --> 00:10:45.490
I couldn't remember their
names for the life of me.

00:10:45.591 --> 00:10:46.593
- No personal questions?

00:10:46.693 --> 00:10:47.962
At least tell me what
your hobbies are.

00:10:48.062 --> 00:10:49.532
- Mah-jong.
- That was quick!

00:10:49.632 --> 00:10:50.133
(Nobu laughs)

00:10:50.233 --> 00:10:51.903
- [Nana] Getting along
with people isn't my forte,

00:10:52.003 --> 00:10:54.107
but I think I handled it well.

00:10:54.208 --> 00:10:56.780
- Sir, I'm so hungry I
can't hit the high notes.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:58.316
- Don't blame it on your
stomach!

00:10:58.416 --> 00:10:59.051
One more time!

00:10:59.151 --> 00:11:01.088
- Hey, sly old fox.
How you doin'?

00:11:01.188 --> 00:11:03.627
What tricks do you have
up your sleeve today?

00:11:03.727 --> 00:11:05.731
(man snickers)
- Nana...

00:11:05.831 --> 00:11:07.835
- Looking good! Hold that pose!

00:11:11.141 --> 00:11:13.614
- Are you gonna tell
Misato about the live show?

00:11:13.714 --> 00:11:14.883
- We're playing on a weekday.

00:11:14.983 --> 00:11:16.653
- She has midterm exams
soon, right?

00:11:16.753 --> 00:11:18.624
If you tell her, she
just might flunk.

00:11:18.724 --> 00:11:20.928
- I wonder she'll ever
be able to graduate.

00:11:21.028 --> 00:11:23.734
- Guys, you can't tell
anyone about the shows!

00:11:23.834 --> 00:11:25.771
- [Nana] I felt that if
I saw Hachi right then,

00:11:25.871 --> 00:11:26.940
I'd be able to laugh

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:29.546
and talk to her like we used to.

00:11:29.646 --> 00:11:30.848
I even felt that I could
listen to her

00:11:30.948 --> 00:11:33.820
talk about Takumi
and the baby.

00:11:33.921 --> 00:11:36.927
But there was absolutely
no time for that.

00:11:44.909 --> 00:11:46.513
- (groans) I'm beat.

00:11:46.613 --> 00:11:48.349
But if I don't do my
laundry today,

00:11:48.449 --> 00:11:50.420
I'll run outta
clothes to wear.

00:11:51.923 --> 00:11:54.494
I've gotta break the
lease on my apartment.

00:11:54.596 --> 00:11:56.600
I'm just wasting money on it.

00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:59.404
Wow, I wish someone would
take care of that for me.

00:11:59.505 --> 00:12:03.479
I can do my laundry too, but
all my stuff won't fit here.

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:06.686
Maybe I could send it
over to my parents' place,

00:12:06.786 --> 00:12:09.358
but I bet my dad's still
pissed off at me.

00:12:09.458 --> 00:12:13.165
- But when Blast debuts, I
bet they'll be so thrilled!

00:12:14.001 --> 00:12:19.378
(sighs)
(elevator bell dings)

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.470
- Oh, how's it going?

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:47.835
Hey, listen.

00:12:47.935 --> 00:12:49.973
Do you mind if I ask you
something?

00:12:50.073 --> 00:12:50.373
- Yeah?

00:12:50.473 --> 00:12:54.381
- I was just wondering about
the hyperventilation thing.

00:12:54.481 --> 00:12:57.120
You probably don't wanna
talk about it, do you?

00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:58.557
I'm sorry.

00:12:58.657 --> 00:12:59.692
- It's all right.

00:12:59.792 --> 00:13:01.061
What is it?

00:13:01.696 --> 00:13:02.765
(Nobu sighs)

00:13:02.865 --> 00:13:05.103
- Someone working at
the record label told me

00:13:05.203 --> 00:13:06.840
that if Nana has another attack,

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:07.775
she'll get even worse

00:13:07.875 --> 00:13:09.579
if the people around
her freak out.

00:13:09.679 --> 00:13:13.820
So I'm supposed to stay calm
and act like nothing's wrong.

00:13:15.156 --> 00:13:16.358
I can see how that makes sense.

00:13:16.458 --> 00:13:19.097
And I guess the doctor said
pretty much the same thing,

00:13:19.197 --> 00:13:21.035
so maybe that's the
right thing to do,

00:13:21.135 --> 00:13:22.872
but wouldn't it make
you feel bad

00:13:22.972 --> 00:13:24.676
if everyone around you
is acting normal

00:13:24.776 --> 00:13:26.278
when you're suffering?

00:13:27.648 --> 00:13:30.888
The thing is, I don't know
if I could remain calm.

00:13:30.988 --> 00:13:32.958
Somehow I doubt it.

00:13:33.059 --> 00:13:35.029
(Miu laughs gently)

00:13:35.129 --> 00:13:37.568
- It doesn't matter if
you're around people

00:13:37.668 --> 00:13:38.402
who are calm or anxious.

00:13:38.503 --> 00:13:39.037
You'll be okay

00:13:39.137 --> 00:13:41.141
as long as you feel
their compassion for you.

00:13:41.241 --> 00:13:43.045
- Huh.
(gentle piano music)

00:13:43.145 --> 00:13:44.348
- I don't know about other
people

00:13:44.448 --> 00:13:47.287
but that's pretty much
how I'd feel.

00:13:49.892 --> 00:13:51.028
(Nobu sighs)

00:13:51.128 --> 00:13:51.896
- I get the feeling

00:13:51.996 --> 00:13:55.069
I just asked something a
normal person should know.

00:13:56.639 --> 00:13:57.842
(gasps)

00:13:57.942 --> 00:14:00.948
Oh, wow. Are you reading
a script for a movie?

00:14:01.649 --> 00:14:03.285
Are you an actress?

00:14:03.386 --> 00:14:04.956
- Well, sort of.

00:14:05.056 --> 00:14:06.659
- I'm sorry. I didn't know.

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:07.360
- It's okay.

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:09.632
It's not like I'm a big
name or anything.

00:14:09.732 --> 00:14:12.170
This is just a small part
in a straight-to-video.

00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:13.707
- Yeah? What's the title?

00:14:13.807 --> 00:14:15.243
I'll watch it when it comes out.

00:14:15.343 --> 00:14:16.813
- Tanki na Onna.

00:14:16.913 --> 00:14:18.249
- A mahjong movie?!

00:14:18.349 --> 00:14:18.884
I love mahjong

00:14:18.984 --> 00:14:20.621
even though I always get stuck
in tanki.

00:14:20.721 --> 00:14:23.492
(Miu giggles)

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.939
Hey, can I ask you
one more question?

00:14:30.039 --> 00:14:30.808
- [Miu] What's that?

00:14:30.908 --> 00:14:32.778
- [Nobu] What's your name?

00:14:32.878 --> 00:14:33.479
(melancholy music)

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:36.586
- [Nana] I wonder how
many people in this city

00:14:36.686 --> 00:14:38.289
know my name right now.

00:14:39.826 --> 00:14:42.798
(crowd chattering)

00:14:42.898 --> 00:14:45.136
- [Girl] Hey, do you think
somebody's gonna play here?

00:14:45.236 --> 00:14:47.240
- It's probably some singer
nobody knows.

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:48.476
- I wish it was Trapnest.

00:14:48.577 --> 00:14:50.681
I could never manage to
get hold of a ticket.

00:14:50.781 --> 00:14:52.283
- Like that'll ever happen.

00:14:52.383 --> 00:14:55.524
Anyway, Yuji and the guys
invited us to karaoke.

00:14:55.624 --> 00:14:56.158
Wanna go?

00:14:56.258 --> 00:14:57.528
- [Girl] Sure, but only if
they're paying.

00:14:57.628 --> 00:14:58.095
- Hey, Kawano.

00:14:58.195 --> 00:15:00.433
We're all ready to
take the stage.

00:15:01.068 --> 00:15:02.404
- All right. Show time.

00:15:02.505 --> 00:15:04.307
Go crazy and wow them.

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:10.554
(dynamic rock music)

00:15:12.825 --> 00:15:16.131
- (gasping) Nana!

00:15:18.503 --> 00:15:22.110
(rock music continuing)

00:15:26.084 --> 00:15:27.988
- Hey, that's Nana's band Blast!

00:15:28.088 --> 00:15:28.890
- For real!
- It's Nana!

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:31.596
- I just hate her!
You suck, Nana!

00:15:31.696 --> 00:15:34.602
- I can't tell who the
hired plants are.

00:15:36.472 --> 00:15:39.277
Looks like more people
know us than I thought.

00:15:40.146 --> 00:15:41.181
I should have known.

00:15:41.281 --> 00:15:43.587
Ren's practically a
household name.

00:15:43.687 --> 00:15:44.221
I guess that means

00:15:44.321 --> 00:15:46.693
I don't have to waste
time on introductions.

00:15:46.793 --> 00:15:49.632
Thanks, paparazzi. Much
appreciated.

00:15:49.732 --> 00:15:51.401
("Lucy" by Anna Tsuchiya
playing)

00:15:51.503 --> 00:15:56.178
October 10th, 2001 at
7:00 PM in Shinjuku.

00:15:56.278 --> 00:15:59.685
Luck, fate, who knows what
brought all of us here

00:15:59.785 --> 00:16:01.355
to this place.

00:16:01.455 --> 00:16:04.194
Just be thankful for it,
you losers.

00:16:41.235 --> 00:16:43.807
- Hey, Hachi.

00:16:43.907 --> 00:16:45.911
It's kind of far back

00:16:46.011 --> 00:16:49.519
but it is the safest
VIP seat in the house.

00:16:52.257 --> 00:16:55.531
I wonder if your baby
can hear me singing too.

00:17:10.794 --> 00:17:12.898
- Hey, everyone, and good
morning.

00:17:12.998 --> 00:17:14.301
It's Friday, October 26th

00:17:14.401 --> 00:17:15.938
and it's time for Music J.

00:17:16.038 --> 00:17:17.407
We're gonna start things off
right for you

00:17:17.508 --> 00:17:20.246
with Trapnest's new
single, "Shadow of Love."

00:17:20.346 --> 00:17:24.387
(gentle piano melody)

00:17:24.487 --> 00:17:27.528
- [Nana] I wanna wear the
same wedding dress as Reira.

00:17:27.628 --> 00:17:27.795
- Huh?

00:17:27.895 --> 00:17:30.199
- You know, the dress she
wears in the music video.

00:17:30.299 --> 00:17:31.201
It's so beautiful!

00:17:31.301 --> 00:17:32.871
That's the dress I want.

00:17:32.972 --> 00:17:33.673
Could they make me the same one?

00:17:33.773 --> 00:17:36.111
- But you already ordered
the wedding dress.

00:17:36.211 --> 00:17:37.046
If you change your mind now,

00:17:37.146 --> 00:17:39.552
you're gonna make
the designer cry.

00:17:39.652 --> 00:17:40.219
- But I want it.

00:17:40.319 --> 00:17:42.190
Maybe I can make it
my third dress.

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:43.459
- That's a bit much.

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:45.998
Besides, it's not the
dress that's pretty.

00:17:46.098 --> 00:17:47.000
It's Reira.

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:47.902
(Nana gasps)

00:17:48.002 --> 00:17:48.937
It wouldn't look good on you.

00:17:49.037 --> 00:17:50.172
Forget about it.

00:17:50.273 --> 00:17:52.243
- You and Reira have
something going on.

00:17:52.343 --> 00:17:53.078
I just knew it!
- No, we don't.

00:17:53.178 --> 00:17:55.216
And what do you mean,
"I knew it"?

00:17:57.988 --> 00:18:00.661
- Hey, Miu! Good morning!

00:18:00.761 --> 00:18:02.030
Oh, calcium.

00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:03.032
Give me a swig.

00:18:03.132 --> 00:18:04.334
- Hey, Nobu.

00:18:04.434 --> 00:18:06.839
Why do you keep calling me Miu?

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:07.608
My name is Miu.

00:18:07.708 --> 00:18:10.313
- Your name is just so
hard to pronounce.

00:18:10.413 --> 00:18:12.985
Besides, it's a cute nickname.

00:18:13.085 --> 00:18:14.220
- That's what everyone says.

00:18:14.321 --> 00:18:16.759
And no one wants to
call me by my real name.

00:18:16.859 --> 00:18:18.162
I like my real name.

00:18:18.262 --> 00:18:19.565
Oh, well.

00:18:20.299 --> 00:18:22.771
- What? No one does?

00:18:22.871 --> 00:18:24.809
Then only I will call you Miu.

00:18:27.748 --> 00:18:28.349
(Nana yawns loudly)

00:18:28.449 --> 00:18:29.652
- So are you guys off today?

00:18:29.752 --> 00:18:31.856
- No, we're gonna be on
a music show tonight.

00:18:31.956 --> 00:18:33.158
So we gotta practice.

00:18:33.258 --> 00:18:35.429
- [Miu] That's rough.
You guys just got here.

00:18:35.530 --> 00:18:36.699
- We've only been living
in the dorm for a month

00:18:36.799 --> 00:18:40.306
and Nobu's already getting
cozy with the girl next door.

00:18:40.406 --> 00:18:42.811
What was the point of switching
rooms with him anyway?

00:18:42.911 --> 00:18:43.546
It would be better

00:18:43.647 --> 00:18:45.651
if he was fooling around
with Miss Yuri.

00:18:45.751 --> 00:18:47.855
How does everyone move
on so easily

00:18:47.955 --> 00:18:50.493
from one person to the next?

00:18:50.594 --> 00:18:52.130
Until recently, all he'd say
was,

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:54.300
"Hachi,
Hachi, Hachi."

00:18:54.401 --> 00:18:56.204
Hachi is the same way.

00:18:56.305 --> 00:18:58.242
They're all such fools.

00:18:59.144 --> 00:19:00.379
But it'd be cruel to force Nobu

00:19:00.479 --> 00:19:03.520
into a relationship that
isn't going anywhere.

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:06.759
I have no right to do
that, but it just sucks.

00:19:06.859 --> 00:19:09.064
(eerie music)

00:19:09.164 --> 00:19:11.201
Oh God. Not again.

00:19:11.301 --> 00:19:13.105
I can't breathe.

00:19:13.205 --> 00:19:16.813
(Nana hyperventilating)

00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:20.486
- Huh?

00:19:23.025 --> 00:19:24.762
- Morning. Going somewhere?

00:19:24.862 --> 00:19:26.632
To get your hair cut?

00:19:26.733 --> 00:19:28.503
- Uh, no, I need to meet with
Mr. Kawano,

00:19:28.603 --> 00:19:30.239
so I'm taking off a bit early.

00:19:30.339 --> 00:19:32.778
You look pale, Nana.
Are you all right?

00:19:32.878 --> 00:19:34.582
- I'm fine, dude.

00:19:34.682 --> 00:19:37.286
(Yasu chuckles)

00:19:37.387 --> 00:19:41.361
(gentle piano music)

00:19:41.461 --> 00:19:45.904
I can't keep Yasu in
unrequited love limbo.

00:19:46.004 --> 00:19:50.179
So why did I go ahead and
move in next door to him?

00:19:50.279 --> 00:19:52.818
That was pretty cruel of me too.

00:19:52.918 --> 00:19:55.524
I think one reason I didn't
wanna get back with Ren

00:19:55.624 --> 00:20:00.232
is because I could feel Yasu's
extraordinary love for me.

00:20:01.268 --> 00:20:03.305
But in the end I was swept away.

00:20:03.405 --> 00:20:06.278
I guess I'm one of
those fools too.

00:20:06.378 --> 00:20:08.115
I'll use the paper bag
just in case,

00:20:08.215 --> 00:20:10.587
especially 'cause today's
a big day.

00:20:12.323 --> 00:20:15.196
I managed to survive
without Ren before,

00:20:15.296 --> 00:20:17.333
but if Yasu wasn't there for me,

00:20:18.168 --> 00:20:20.640
I'd be completely lost.

00:20:23.913 --> 00:20:26.084
I've got to end it.

00:20:26.184 --> 00:20:28.222
The next time I see Ren,

00:20:28.322 --> 00:20:29.959
I won't get swept away.

00:20:32.965 --> 00:20:33.499
- It's been a while

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.136
since we played on live TV.

00:20:35.236 --> 00:20:36.539
The fans must be so psyched

00:20:36.639 --> 00:20:39.244
and I bet the ratings are
gonna be out of this world!

00:20:39.344 --> 00:20:41.448
- Of course the ratings
will be good.

00:20:41.549 --> 00:20:42.951
They're throwing us
in the pit together.

00:20:43.051 --> 00:20:46.124
But even if they pick a fight,
I'm not gonna fight back.

00:20:46.224 --> 00:20:47.093
- What are you talking about?

00:20:47.193 --> 00:20:49.097
There's no violence
here, Takumi.

00:20:49.197 --> 00:20:50.366
- Blast is on the show tonight!

00:20:50.466 --> 00:20:53.840
(Reira gasps)

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:56.646
- Hey, Hachi.

00:20:56.746 --> 00:21:00.386
I always thought life was like
swimming against the current

00:21:00.486 --> 00:21:03.793
no matter how strong it was.

00:21:03.893 --> 00:21:07.500
But going with the flow isn't
such a bad thing after all

00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:10.841
as long as you're
moving forward.
