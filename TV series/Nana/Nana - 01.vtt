WEBVTT

00:00:00.768 --> 00:00:02.939
(light relaxing music)

00:00:04.102 --> 00:00:06.040
- [Nana Komatsu] Hey Nana.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.514
Remember the first time we met?

00:00:09.614 --> 00:00:12.687
You know how I believe
in things like fate?

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.327
Well, I think that was fate.

00:00:16.427 --> 00:00:19.333
You can laugh if you want.

00:00:21.003 --> 00:00:25.144
(upbeat rock music)

00:02:01.871 --> 00:02:05.512
Oh dear God, great
Buddha, demon Lord.

00:02:09.286 --> 00:02:11.925
(gasps) Yay!

00:02:12.025 --> 00:02:16.333
(playful upbeat music)

00:02:17.035 --> 00:02:18.070
Excuse me?

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.106
I wanted to return
this video.

00:02:19.206 --> 00:02:20.308
Hey Nana!

00:02:20.408 --> 00:02:22.680
What's with all the noise?

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:23.447
(Nana laughing)

00:02:23.548 --> 00:02:25.051
[Nana] Spring is here!

00:02:25.151 --> 00:02:26.420
Spring is finally here!

00:02:26.521 --> 00:02:29.292
I've waited so long for this.

00:02:31.631 --> 00:02:35.639
Looking back on it,
I was basically
running away from home.

00:02:36.975 --> 00:02:43.354
But I don't think my
parents were that surprised.

00:02:43.454 --> 00:02:46.293
Back home, I have two sisters.

00:02:46.393 --> 00:02:50.769
One is older and
the other is younger.

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:54.276
It was pretty crowded
around our house.

00:02:54.376 --> 00:02:57.449
Back then, I spent all
my time yammering on

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.423
about visiting Tokyo
or living there.

00:03:01.524 --> 00:03:03.895
I think my parents
were secretly relieved

00:03:03.995 --> 00:03:08.437
that one of their obnoxious
daughters had finally left home.

00:03:11.544 --> 00:03:14.483
I was leaving my
family and the city

00:03:14.584 --> 00:03:17.556
I'd lived in my whole life.

00:03:17.656 --> 00:03:22.633
But any feelings of home
sickness hadn't hit me yet.

00:03:22.733 --> 00:03:25.438
I was so excited to
be going to Tokyo.

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:30.281
My heart was full of
hope and expectation.

00:03:33.588 --> 00:03:36.895
Now I have the chance
to see Shoji every day!

00:03:38.063 --> 00:03:39.767
(bell ringing)

00:03:39.867 --> 00:03:42.573
No more text messages,
no more phone calls.

00:03:42.673 --> 00:03:45.712
Finally, we could talk
face to face again.

00:03:48.083 --> 00:03:49.921
[Announcer] Thank you for
choosing the bullet train

00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:51.658
with service to Tokyo.

00:03:51.758 --> 00:03:52.458
We apologize.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.730
[Nana] Wow. The
train's packed.

00:03:54.831 --> 00:03:58.705
I'd better hurry up and find
a seat so I can text Shoji.

00:04:14.804 --> 00:04:16.473
Excuse me?

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.318
Hello? Excuse-

00:04:22.418 --> 00:04:25.826
(wheels screech)
(Nana yells)

00:04:25.926 --> 00:04:29.800
(wheels whistling)

00:04:37.081 --> 00:04:38.518
What happened?
Why'd we stop?

00:04:38.618 --> 00:04:40.087
Was there an accident?

00:04:40.188 --> 00:04:41.791
[Nana] You okay?

00:04:43.862 --> 00:04:46.166
[Nana Komatsu]
Yeah, I'm fine sorry.

00:04:46.266 --> 00:04:47.302
No, I'm sorry.

00:04:47.402 --> 00:04:49.139
Hope this didn't hurt
you when it fell.

00:04:49.239 --> 00:04:51.343
I'm fine.

00:04:53.582 --> 00:04:56.588
By the way, is this seat?

00:04:56.688 --> 00:04:59.159
I mean, would it be okay if I--

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:00.696
Go ahead.

00:05:01.196 --> 00:05:03.100
Huh?

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.574
(relaxing music)

00:05:10.649 --> 00:05:12.385
She's so beautiful.

00:05:12.485 --> 00:05:13.722
And so cool too.

00:05:13.822 --> 00:05:15.491
There's something
different about her,

00:05:15.592 --> 00:05:18.330
like she's got
this special aura.

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.370
So thin and such a pretty face.

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:22.706
Maybe she's famous.

00:05:22.806 --> 00:05:25.612
Those long eyelashes
and her makeup?

00:05:25.712 --> 00:05:28.718
It really stands out,
but it looks perfect.

00:05:28.818 --> 00:05:32.893
Beautiful people always look
great no matter what they do.

00:05:32.993 --> 00:05:36.033
Wow, a designer ring.

00:05:36.133 --> 00:05:38.939
That is so cool.

00:05:40.441 --> 00:05:41.945
Is the smoke bothering you?

00:05:42.045 --> 00:05:43.715
No, no, no.
That's okay.

00:05:43.815 --> 00:05:45.051
I'm fine.

00:05:47.623 --> 00:05:51.063
We're getting
nowhere fast.

00:05:51.163 --> 00:05:52.766
The train.

00:05:52.866 --> 00:05:54.704
Keeps on stopping like this.

00:05:54.804 --> 00:05:57.041
[Nana Komatsu] Really?
What am I gonna do?

00:05:57.141 --> 00:05:59.179
I'm in a hurry.

00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:01.316
Yeah, that's too bad.

00:06:01.416 --> 00:06:02.953
I know what I can do.

00:06:03.053 --> 00:06:04.289
I can text him.

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:06.794
(phone beeping)

00:06:06.894 --> 00:06:07.462
There.

00:06:07.563 --> 00:06:09.099
That was really fast.

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:11.236
I'm amazed at how you
high school students

00:06:11.336 --> 00:06:12.640
keep up with all
that technology.

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.075
I'm not in high school.

00:06:14.175 --> 00:06:15.344
I'm already 20.

00:06:15.444 --> 00:06:16.648
(Nana laughs)

00:06:16.748 --> 00:06:20.221
Sorry, I never would've
guessed we were the same age.

00:06:20.321 --> 00:06:23.294
She's so cute when she laughs.

00:06:23.394 --> 00:06:24.396
You gotta be kidding.

00:06:24.496 --> 00:06:25.899
You don't look the
same age as me.

00:06:25.999 --> 00:06:26.901
You can't be 20.

00:06:27.001 --> 00:06:28.304
I mean, the way you said
you high school students

00:06:28.404 --> 00:06:30.441
makes you seem a lot older.

00:06:30.542 --> 00:06:31.878
Guess that's
just how I am.

00:06:31.978 --> 00:06:34.717
I'm still part of
the analog world.

00:06:34.817 --> 00:06:36.286
[Announcer] Ladies
and gentlemen,

00:06:36.386 --> 00:06:37.121
we will be moving again soon.

00:06:37.221 --> 00:06:38.725
But because of the
weather conditions,

00:06:38.825 --> 00:06:40.261
we'll be proceeding
much slower than normal.

00:06:40.361 --> 00:06:41.764
We apologize for
any inconvenience
this delay has caused.

00:06:41.864 --> 00:06:43.000
[Nana Komatsu] I
don't believe it.

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.839
How long is it going to
take us to get to Tokyo now?

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:48.812
So what's with the
big hurry to get there?

00:06:48.912 --> 00:06:49.346
- Nothing much.

00:06:49.446 --> 00:06:51.350
I wanted to move
to Tokyo for ages.

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:54.155
I'm going to look for
a job when I get there.

00:06:54.255 --> 00:06:55.424
No kidding, so am I.

00:06:55.525 --> 00:06:56.961
You mean you're
moving to Tokyo?

00:06:57.061 --> 00:06:57.830
Yeah.

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:58.497
Oh, wow.

00:06:58.598 --> 00:06:59.934
I assumed you
lived there already

00:07:00.034 --> 00:07:02.171
and you were just coming back
from a tour or something.

00:07:02.271 --> 00:07:03.207
A tour?

00:07:03.307 --> 00:07:05.211
Yeah, like doing
concerts everywhere.

00:07:05.311 --> 00:07:06.013
When I saw your guitar,

00:07:06.113 --> 00:07:08.183
I figured you must be a
professional musician.

00:07:08.283 --> 00:07:08.985
Oh.

00:07:09.085 --> 00:07:11.724
[Nana Komatsu] So
are you in a band?

00:07:11.824 --> 00:07:14.396
I was in one back
at home, yeah.

00:07:14.496 --> 00:07:15.197
I knew it.

00:07:15.297 --> 00:07:16.266
That is so cool.

00:07:16.366 --> 00:07:17.402
Where are you from?

00:07:17.503 --> 00:07:18.638
Oh, a message.

00:07:18.738 --> 00:07:21.076
No, wait, someone's calling.

00:07:22.445 --> 00:07:24.315
Hello, this is Nana.

00:07:24.416 --> 00:07:27.121
Hey there, Shoji.

00:07:27.221 --> 00:07:28.992
Yeah, we got stuck in the snow.

00:07:29.092 --> 00:07:29.860
The train's delayed.

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.165
I don't know when
we'll get there.

00:07:32.265 --> 00:07:33.835
Are you sure that's okay?

00:07:33.935 --> 00:07:36.908
We might not get into the
station until after midnight.

00:07:37.008 --> 00:07:40.114
If you're sure you don't mind.

00:07:40.214 --> 00:07:43.387
That sounds great, thanks. I'll
give you a call once we know

00:07:43.487 --> 00:07:45.091
for sure when we'll arrive.

00:07:45.191 --> 00:07:46.894
Okay, bye for now.

00:07:49.667 --> 00:07:51.403
So you got a
boyfriend in Tokyo?

00:07:51.504 --> 00:07:54.008
You sure are lovey
dovey with him.

00:07:54.109 --> 00:07:55.444
Now it all makes sense.

00:07:55.545 --> 00:07:57.750
You're going to Tokyo
to be with your guy.

00:07:57.850 --> 00:07:59.018
No!

00:07:59.119 --> 00:08:00.722
Okay, sorta, maybe.

00:08:00.822 --> 00:08:03.026
(laughs) Are you
or aren't you?

00:08:03.127 --> 00:08:05.097
Well, he is not
actually from Tokyo.

00:08:05.197 --> 00:08:07.536
We know each other
from back home.

00:08:07.636 --> 00:08:09.472
We went to the same
school together,

00:08:09.573 --> 00:08:13.180
but he wanted to go and study
at an art college in Tokyo,

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:16.353
so he decided to move there.

00:08:16.453 --> 00:08:16.988
Why didn't you go with him?

00:08:17.088 --> 00:08:19.125
Seems like the
obvious thing to do.

00:08:19.225 --> 00:08:19.927
Oh, I wanted to.

00:08:20.027 --> 00:08:24.970
Believe me, I wanted to, but
he told me to stay behind.

00:08:25.071 --> 00:08:26.073
How come?

00:08:26.173 --> 00:08:27.876
Because I had no idea
what I wanted to do

00:08:27.976 --> 00:08:29.379
and no money to do it with.

00:08:29.479 --> 00:08:32.385
He said, I should have some
sort of plan before I left home.

00:08:32.485 --> 00:08:34.222
That makes sense.

00:08:34.322 --> 00:08:36.093
So I bit my lip,
stayed at home,

00:08:36.193 --> 00:08:38.297
and started saving up enough
money to make the move.

00:08:38.397 --> 00:08:40.936
We made a promise that if
he passed his university

00:08:41.036 --> 00:08:43.107
entrance exams, then
I would join him.

00:08:43.207 --> 00:08:45.111
Once I'm in Tokyo, I'll get a
job so I can support myself.

00:08:45.211 --> 00:08:49.219
And that way I don't have
to be dependent on him.

00:08:49.319 --> 00:08:52.258
I can't believe I've been
pouring my heart out like this

00:08:52.358 --> 00:08:54.195
to a complete stranger.

00:08:54.295 --> 00:08:54.930
Nothing wrong with that.

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:56.801
Sometimes it's easier
to talk to a stranger.

00:08:56.901 --> 00:08:59.272
Besides, looks like we're
gonna be sitting here

00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:00.341
for quite a while.

00:09:00.441 --> 00:09:01.376
Huh?

00:09:01.476 --> 00:09:03.915
Yeah, I guess you're right.

00:09:04.015 --> 00:09:06.119
So then why don't I
tell you some more?

00:09:06.219 --> 00:09:08.190
To be honest, I've been
dying to talk to somebody

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:09.058
about my boyfriend!

00:09:09.159 --> 00:09:11.564
His name's Shoji and
he's nice, considerate,

00:09:11.664 --> 00:09:12.833
and a totally cool guy.

00:09:12.933 --> 00:09:14.637
Sometimes he can be a bit of a
goof when he opens his mouth,

00:09:14.737 --> 00:09:15.772
but that's okay.

00:09:15.872 --> 00:09:17.441
A goof and you
still like the guy?

00:09:17.543 --> 00:09:19.179
Hey, how about I
buy us both of beer?

00:09:19.279 --> 00:09:20.414
Sure, why not?

00:09:20.515 --> 00:09:22.285
Two beers, please!

00:09:23.955 --> 00:09:26.159
Okay. I think we
should make a toast.

00:09:26.259 --> 00:09:28.096
Okay. To what?

00:09:29.834 --> 00:09:30.902
Shoji passing his exam?

00:09:31.002 --> 00:09:33.073
Nah, that's got
nothing to do with me.

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:37.315
All right then, what about
a toast to you and me?

00:09:37.415 --> 00:09:38.618
Yeah, I'll drink to that.

00:09:38.718 --> 00:09:40.254
A toast to two girls
who are the same age

00:09:40.354 --> 00:09:42.759
who happen to be going to
Tokyo at the same time,

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:44.496
stuck on the same train.

00:09:44.597 --> 00:09:46.901
Quite a coincidence, right?

00:09:47.001 --> 00:09:49.038
And there's one more thing.

00:09:49.138 --> 00:09:53.146
A toast to the fact that
both of us are called Nana.

00:09:56.386 --> 00:09:59.727
[Nana Komatsu] Remember
the first time we met?

00:10:00.862 --> 00:10:03.133
A snowstorm blew
in out of nowhere

00:10:03.233 --> 00:10:06.774
and the train moved
along so slowly.

00:10:06.874 --> 00:10:10.481
It took us five hours
to get to Tokyo.

00:10:10.582 --> 00:10:13.220
But the time seemed to fly by.

00:10:16.026 --> 00:10:18.330
I talked endlessly about myself,

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:21.804
so I didn't get to find
out anything about you.

00:10:26.012 --> 00:10:27.315
Now that I know you better,

00:10:27.415 --> 00:10:31.022
I'm pretty sure you wouldn't
have said much anyway.

00:10:44.449 --> 00:10:45.919
[Shoji] Nana!

00:10:47.689 --> 00:10:49.025
Shoji!

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:56.774
(Nana panting)

00:11:06.627 --> 00:11:07.428
Why are you crying?

00:11:07.529 --> 00:11:08.497
I thought you'd be happy.

00:11:08.598 --> 00:11:10.334
Of course I'm
happy to see you.

00:11:10.434 --> 00:11:13.140
Must have been tough sitting
on that train for five hours.

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:14.677
Mhmm.

00:11:14.777 --> 00:11:16.614
Well, it was okay.

00:11:16.714 --> 00:11:18.016
Oh.

00:11:20.354 --> 00:11:21.757
[Shoji] What's up?

00:11:21.857 --> 00:11:25.064
I made friends with the
girl sitting next to me.

00:11:25.164 --> 00:11:26.333
Yeah?

00:11:26.433 --> 00:11:27.536
I don't see her.

00:11:27.636 --> 00:11:29.172
We got off the train together.

00:11:29.272 --> 00:11:32.345
I wonder where she
could have gone.

00:11:32.445 --> 00:11:35.552
We didn't even get the chance
to swap numbers and stuff.

00:11:35.652 --> 00:11:36.486
What's up with that?

00:11:36.587 --> 00:11:39.459
Then it's not like you're
really friends with her at all.

00:11:40.227 --> 00:11:40.662
Stop crying.

00:11:40.762 --> 00:11:43.868
Kyosuke and Junko are
waiting for us downstairs.

00:11:44.937 --> 00:11:46.507
(Nana exclaims)

00:11:46.607 --> 00:11:47.509
Jun!

00:11:47.609 --> 00:11:52.018
(whimsical upbeat music)

00:12:08.383 --> 00:12:11.389
[Jun] See ya.
[Shoji] Goodnight!

00:12:14.596 --> 00:12:15.799
What are you waiting for Nana?

00:12:15.899 --> 00:12:16.734
Let's go inside.

00:12:16.834 --> 00:12:18.103
Okay.

00:12:18.638 --> 00:12:20.107
Wait a minute.

00:12:20.207 --> 00:12:23.447
Is it okay for me to be
staying here with him?

00:12:23.548 --> 00:12:23.982
[Shoji] Come on in.

00:12:24.082 --> 00:12:26.854
Sorry, my place is
a bit of a mess.

00:12:28.791 --> 00:12:30.394
[Nana] Sorry.

00:12:30.494 --> 00:12:32.131
Hope it's not too much
trouble coming to stay

00:12:32.231 --> 00:12:33.568
at such short notice.

00:12:33.668 --> 00:12:35.505
To be honest, I thought
it was gonna be staying

00:12:35.605 --> 00:12:38.745
with Jun until I managed
to find a place of my own.

00:12:38.845 --> 00:12:41.249
That'd be kind of awkward
though, wouldn't it?

00:12:41.349 --> 00:12:43.453
Now that the two of them
are living together.

00:12:43.554 --> 00:12:44.088
- Ah!

00:12:44.188 --> 00:12:45.457
No way, you're kidding.

00:12:45.558 --> 00:12:47.529
Junko never mentioned
anything to me about it.

00:12:47.629 --> 00:12:48.463
Since when?

00:12:48.564 --> 00:12:49.967
- It just kind of happened.

00:12:50.067 --> 00:12:52.471
Kyosuke was spending
more and more time there

00:12:52.572 --> 00:12:54.543
and then eventually he moved in.

00:12:56.079 --> 00:12:56.881
[Nana] Wow.
[Shoji] Hey, come on.

00:12:56.981 --> 00:12:57.716
Take your shoes off.

00:12:57.816 --> 00:12:58.584
I never would've guessed.

00:12:58.685 --> 00:13:00.454
[Shoji] This is
Japan, remember?

00:13:00.555 --> 00:13:02.158
Oh, it must be so great!

00:13:02.258 --> 00:13:03.995
Now what?

00:13:04.095 --> 00:13:06.433
[Nana] Hey are trying to get
me undressed already?

00:13:06.534 --> 00:13:07.903
Pervert!

00:13:09.005 --> 00:13:13.246
I wonder if Shoji and I
will end up like that.

00:13:13.346 --> 00:13:16.486
I want to make up for all
the time we were apart.

00:13:16.587 --> 00:13:18.356
I'm so happy.

00:13:23.634 --> 00:13:27.676
No, I wanted to get up early
and make breakfast for him!

00:13:27.776 --> 00:13:30.147
(Nana sighs)

00:13:30.247 --> 00:13:33.320
But I can still work
hard until he gets home.

00:13:39.298 --> 00:13:41.069
Doing all this stuff
kind of makes me feel

00:13:41.169 --> 00:13:42.806
like I'm his wife.

00:13:42.906 --> 00:13:44.242
Imagine how great it would be

00:13:44.342 --> 00:13:47.649
if I helped him like
this every single day.

00:13:51.957 --> 00:13:53.928
You know, this
actually tastes good.

00:13:54.028 --> 00:13:55.598
There's no need for you
to sound so surprised.

00:13:55.698 --> 00:13:57.669
Let's face it, you
seem like you'd be bad

00:13:57.769 --> 00:13:58.638
at this sort of thing.

00:13:58.738 --> 00:13:59.940
You've never had
my food before!

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:00.942
I'm just kidding.

00:14:01.042 --> 00:14:02.211
It really is good.

00:14:02.311 --> 00:14:05.017
This miso soup is perfect.

00:14:05.117 --> 00:14:07.388
[Nana] And it only took
me three hours to make.

00:14:07.488 --> 00:14:10.595
So how did things go with
the real estate agent today?

00:14:10.695 --> 00:14:11.897
Did you find a place?

00:14:11.997 --> 00:14:13.601
I got so busy with
everything else,

00:14:13.701 --> 00:14:15.304
I kind of ran out of time.

00:14:15.404 --> 00:14:15.638
Oh yeah?

00:14:15.738 --> 00:14:18.143
Did the job hunting take longer
than you thought it would?

00:14:18.243 --> 00:14:19.112
Get any good leads?

00:14:19.212 --> 00:14:20.748
[Nana] That's right.

00:14:20.849 --> 00:14:22.084
I gotta find a job.

00:14:22.184 --> 00:14:24.489
Or did you stay
in bed all day?

00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:25.157
No, I did not.

00:14:25.257 --> 00:14:27.562
In case you hadn't noticed
your apartment is spotless,

00:14:27.662 --> 00:14:29.499
thanks to me and my hard work.

00:14:30.902 --> 00:14:32.873
You spent the day doing what?

00:14:32.973 --> 00:14:34.375
You didn't come all
this way to Tokyo

00:14:34.475 --> 00:14:36.312
to spend your time
cleaning my place.

00:14:36.412 --> 00:14:38.651
You promised me that if you
came here, you'd find a job,

00:14:38.751 --> 00:14:41.022
so that way you could
take care of yourself.

00:14:41.122 --> 00:14:42.191
Is that all the thanks I get

00:14:42.291 --> 00:14:43.795
after everything I've
done for you today?

00:14:43.895 --> 00:14:46.032
Thanks a lot, Shoji.

00:14:49.573 --> 00:14:52.813
I shouldn't have snapped
at him like that.

00:14:52.913 --> 00:14:55.150
I don't wanna make him feel bad.

00:14:59.927 --> 00:15:02.164
[Shoji] Thanks for dinner.

00:15:03.033 --> 00:15:04.703
[Nana] Let me do the dishes.

00:15:04.803 --> 00:15:05.939
[Shoji] It's okay.

00:15:06.039 --> 00:15:07.976
I can do it myself.

00:15:13.053 --> 00:15:14.288
You're not gonna find anything

00:15:14.388 --> 00:15:16.226
for less than
50,000 yen a month.

00:15:16.326 --> 00:15:17.529
I guess if I work hard,

00:15:17.629 --> 00:15:19.867
I can afford to pay a
bit more for my rent,

00:15:19.967 --> 00:15:21.604
but is there any way
you can help me out

00:15:21.704 --> 00:15:23.841
by giving me some sort
of deal on the deposit?

00:15:23.941 --> 00:15:25.244
Hmm.

00:15:25.344 --> 00:15:28.551
How would you feel about
living in an older building?

00:15:29.252 --> 00:15:30.955
They don't want any deposit?

00:15:31.055 --> 00:15:32.993
It's a huge apartment
for that price,

00:15:33.093 --> 00:15:34.963
and we can have pets as well?

00:15:35.063 --> 00:15:36.567
Would you like to take a look?

00:15:36.667 --> 00:15:38.036
Sure.

00:15:38.136 --> 00:15:41.710
(birds chirping)

00:15:44.716 --> 00:15:45.752
There it is.

00:15:45.852 --> 00:15:48.290
That brick
building up ahead.

00:15:52.699 --> 00:15:55.505
[Nana] It was built a long
time ago, before I was born.

00:15:55.605 --> 00:15:59.880
It looked really elegant and
had that old classic style.

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:04.790
I fell in love with it from
the moment I laid eyes on it.

00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:07.829
The only problem was that
it's a seven floor walkup

00:16:07.929 --> 00:16:11.971
with no elevator, but it had
an excellent view of the river.

00:16:12.071 --> 00:16:13.406
Perfect for someone like me,

00:16:13.507 --> 00:16:15.645
who was used to
living in the country.

00:16:15.745 --> 00:16:17.549
It made me feel at home.

00:16:30.842 --> 00:16:31.342
Oh no.

00:16:31.442 --> 00:16:33.648
Looks like somebody's
already here.

00:16:33.748 --> 00:16:36.486
Do you mind if I show
the place to my client?

00:16:36.587 --> 00:16:39.191
Sorry, this young lady's
pretty much decided

00:16:39.292 --> 00:16:41.296
to take the place.

00:16:44.736 --> 00:16:45.605
Nana!

00:16:45.705 --> 00:16:47.007
It is you, isn't it?

00:16:47.107 --> 00:16:48.476
What a coincidence.

00:16:48.578 --> 00:16:50.480
Who are you?

00:16:50.582 --> 00:16:53.186
[Nana Komatsu] Am
I that forgettable?

00:16:53.286 --> 00:16:55.290
[Nana] (laughs) Sorry, sorry.

00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:56.760
Are you all right, Nana?

00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:58.463
- [Nana Komatsu] So,
you do remember me.

00:16:58.564 --> 00:16:59.465
- [Nana] I didn't recognize you.

00:16:59.566 --> 00:17:00.467
Those clothes and that hair

00:17:00.568 --> 00:17:02.171
make you look
completely different.

00:17:02.271 --> 00:17:03.608
Total change of style.

00:17:03.708 --> 00:17:05.812
- So I take it you
two are friends?

00:17:05.912 --> 00:17:07.348
[Nana K] Yes, we're
good friends.
[Nana] I wouldn't say

00:17:07.448 --> 00:17:09.519
we're friends exactly.

00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:12.157
Anyway, I suppose we
should get down to business,

00:17:12.257 --> 00:17:13.259
Miss Osaki?

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:15.330
Have you decided, will
you take the place?

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:16.734
I'm still thinking about it.

00:17:16.834 --> 00:17:17.869
Well, if you haven't decided,

00:17:17.969 --> 00:17:20.742
perhaps you'd allow me to
give this young lady a tour

00:17:20.842 --> 00:17:22.011
of the apartment?

00:17:22.111 --> 00:17:23.013
Cool!

00:17:23.113 --> 00:17:24.683
The kitchen is so cute.

00:17:24.783 --> 00:17:26.386
The rooms are so big!

00:17:26.486 --> 00:17:28.557
An old fashioned claw foot tub?

00:17:28.658 --> 00:17:31.262
(Nana laughing)

00:17:33.033 --> 00:17:33.734
I'll take it!

00:17:33.834 --> 00:17:35.404
[Nana And Yokoi]
Hold on a minute.

00:17:35.505 --> 00:17:36.507
I found this place first.

00:17:36.607 --> 00:17:38.410
You can't just barge in
here and take it from me.

00:17:38.511 --> 00:17:40.682
I didn't mean to, I'm sorry.

00:17:40.782 --> 00:17:41.282
You should be.

00:17:41.382 --> 00:17:42.519
What on earth were
you thinking?

00:17:42.619 --> 00:17:44.890
To be fair, it
didn't look as though

00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:46.159
you had made up your mind yet.

00:17:46.259 --> 00:17:47.161
- Well, now I have.

00:17:47.261 --> 00:17:47.996
I'm taking it.

00:17:48.096 --> 00:17:48.396
Yokoi.

00:17:48.496 --> 00:17:50.167
(Nana Komatsu gasps)

00:17:50.267 --> 00:17:51.670
[Nana Komatsu] Wait,
don't do it!

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:52.204
I'm not waiting.

00:17:52.304 --> 00:17:52.772
My mind's made up.

00:17:52.872 --> 00:17:55.277
I'm fed up with sleeping
in crappy rundown hotels.

00:17:55.377 --> 00:17:56.613
I don't care where I live

00:17:56.714 --> 00:17:58.283
as long as I get a
place of my own now.

00:17:58.383 --> 00:17:59.686
If you don't care
where you live,

00:17:59.786 --> 00:18:00.287
then find somewhere else,

00:18:00.387 --> 00:18:01.724
'cause this is where
I want to live.

00:18:01.824 --> 00:18:04.796
What's wrong with you staying
at your boyfriend's place?

00:18:04.896 --> 00:18:06.032
(Nana gasps)

00:18:06.132 --> 00:18:07.034
He dumped you didn't he?

00:18:07.134 --> 00:18:08.236
No!

00:18:08.336 --> 00:18:10.842
But if things carry on the
way they have been, he might.

00:18:10.942 --> 00:18:11.510
What do you mean?

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:13.581
I thought you were all
lovey dovey for him?

00:18:13.681 --> 00:18:14.950
I thought so too,
but last night he--

00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:15.785
[Yokoi] Excuse me, ladies.

00:18:15.885 --> 00:18:18.123
I'm not sure now was the
time to be discussing

00:18:18.223 --> 00:18:18.991
nonsense like this.

00:18:19.091 --> 00:18:19.926
[Both Nanas] Nonsense?

00:18:20.027 --> 00:18:23.466
Here I am suffering such
pain and he calls it nonsense?

00:18:23.567 --> 00:18:24.001
Yokoi?

00:18:24.101 --> 00:18:24.368
Yes?

00:18:24.468 --> 00:18:26.172
For someone who supposedly
works in the service industry,

00:18:26.272 --> 00:18:28.109
you sure don't have much tact.

00:18:28.209 --> 00:18:28.878
I'm sorry.

00:18:28.978 --> 00:18:29.111
I apologize.

00:18:29.211 --> 00:18:31.850
Your job isn't just about
earning a paycheck, you know.

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:33.219
Be a little more sensitive.

00:18:33.319 --> 00:18:36.059
Now, now, calm down ladies.

00:18:36.159 --> 00:18:36.927
Sensitive?

00:18:37.027 --> 00:18:40.500
If I may, I have a suggestion,
I'd like to run by you.

00:18:40.601 --> 00:18:43.173
Who the hell is this old
guy anyway, your grandpa?

00:18:43.273 --> 00:18:45.310
This is Mr. Ondo from
the real estate agency

00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:46.112
by the train station.

00:18:46.212 --> 00:18:48.951
He's been in the biz for 52
years, so he's like a veteran.

00:18:49.051 --> 00:18:51.757
It's obvious the two of you
already know each other.

00:18:51.857 --> 00:18:55.030
Perhaps you should consider
renting the apartment together.

00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:56.633
Why don't you become roommates?

00:18:56.734 --> 00:18:58.838
The place is designed with
the dining room in the middle

00:18:58.938 --> 00:19:01.075
and two bedrooms
at opposite ends,

00:19:01.175 --> 00:19:03.046
which means you can
have your own privacy.

00:19:03.146 --> 00:19:06.486
Plus, you'll have each other's
company when you want it.

00:19:06.587 --> 00:19:10.695
Sharing an apartment can be
a very rewarding experience.

00:19:10.795 --> 00:19:14.836
Also, by sharing you'll each
only half to pay half the rent.

00:19:14.936 --> 00:19:16.239
[Both] Half the rent?

00:19:16.339 --> 00:19:17.642
Half of 70,000?

00:19:17.742 --> 00:19:18.511
35,000 yen.

00:19:18.611 --> 00:19:20.180
[Both] That's so cheap.

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:21.149
[Nana Komatsu]
Let's go for it, Nana.

00:19:21.249 --> 00:19:23.052
I suppose this means you
and I are gonna have to split

00:19:23.153 --> 00:19:25.490
our brokers fee in
half as well.

00:19:25.591 --> 00:19:26.760
[Nana] Yeah, sounds okay.

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:29.265
But how do I know I
can live with you?

00:19:29.365 --> 00:19:30.802
Can you respect
someone else's privacy?

00:19:30.902 --> 00:19:32.204
Of course I can.

00:19:32.304 --> 00:19:34.108
If privacy is an issue,

00:19:34.208 --> 00:19:36.580
you can always put locks
on the bedroom doors.

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:38.216
It's a very cheap solution.

00:19:38.316 --> 00:19:40.353
I can even arrange
the installation.

00:19:40.454 --> 00:19:42.491
Oh, thank you,
Mr. Ondo, thank you!

00:19:42.592 --> 00:19:43.928
You're such a nice person.

00:19:44.028 --> 00:19:44.663
Isn't he a nice--

00:19:44.763 --> 00:19:46.567
[Yokoi] Miss Osaki, are you sure
you wanna go ahead with this?

00:19:46.667 --> 00:19:48.537
Yes, it'll be cheaper,
but think it through.

00:19:48.637 --> 00:19:52.444
You barely know this girl and
she seems kind of annoying.

00:19:55.016 --> 00:19:57.187
[Nana] I disagree.

00:19:57.287 --> 00:20:00.728
Yokoi, you're a sad lonely man.

00:20:00.828 --> 00:20:04.970
Mr. Ondo, how soon can
those locks be put in?

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:06.874
If I arrange it right away,

00:20:06.974 --> 00:20:09.278
I can have someone come
by tomorrow morning.

00:20:09.378 --> 00:20:10.615
Thank you.
Please do.

00:20:10.715 --> 00:20:14.355
I'll start moving my stuff
in tomorrow afternoon.

00:20:15.825 --> 00:20:17.327
What about you?

00:20:19.431 --> 00:20:20.868
Yeah, me too.

00:20:30.453 --> 00:20:32.926
(warming orchestral music)

00:20:33.026 --> 00:20:33.694
[Nana] Starting tomorrow,

00:20:33.794 --> 00:20:36.332
you and I will be
roommates, Nana.

00:20:51.295 --> 00:20:52.999
[Nana Komatsu] At that moment,

00:20:53.099 --> 00:20:56.239
I felt like I was going to cry.

00:20:56.339 --> 00:20:58.744
I don't really know
how to explain it,

00:20:58.844 --> 00:21:02.484
but when I was
shaking Nana's hand,

00:21:02.585 --> 00:21:06.392
I felt this warmth that
went straight to my heart.

00:21:06.492 --> 00:21:09.900
(upbeat music)
