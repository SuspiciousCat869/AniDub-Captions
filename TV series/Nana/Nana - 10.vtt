WEBVTT

00:00:03.128 --> 00:00:04.765
- [Komatsu] That night our
private concert

00:00:04.865 --> 00:00:06.434
rocked deep into the night.

00:00:06.535 --> 00:00:08.506
We got complaints from the
neighbors

00:00:08.606 --> 00:00:11.144
but that wasn't much of a
surprise.

00:00:11.244 --> 00:00:15.285
("rose" by Anna Tsuchiya)

00:01:45.065 --> 00:01:47.369
- I'm really sorry about the
noise.

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:48.539
- [Yamada] You better be.

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:51.645
Do you have any idea what time
it is?

00:01:51.745 --> 00:01:52.881
- [Komatsu] Yes. I'm sorry.

00:01:52.981 --> 00:01:55.218
- Kids nowadays have no respect.

00:01:55.318 --> 00:01:56.788
- [Komatsu] We'll try to
be quieter from now on.

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:59.794
- [Yamada] Why do we always
have trouble with apartment 707?

00:01:59.895 --> 00:02:00.897
It must be a curse.

00:02:00.997 --> 00:02:01.899
- Now, now, miss Yamada.

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:03.234
Don't talk about that.

00:02:03.334 --> 00:02:05.071
(suspenseful music)

00:02:05.171 --> 00:02:06.808
- There was a murder in our
apartment?

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:07.877
- Mm-hm!

00:02:07.977 --> 00:02:09.915
The tenant before us was killed.

00:02:10.015 --> 00:02:12.419
- Who told you a story like
that?

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.221
- Miss Yamada!

00:02:13.321 --> 00:02:14.056
- And who's that?

00:02:14.156 --> 00:02:15.358
- I don't know, one of the
neighbors!

00:02:15.458 --> 00:02:16.995
She was in a negligee,
hair all done up

00:02:17.095 --> 00:02:17.864
and wearing lots of makeup.

00:02:17.964 --> 00:02:19.133
Why makeup at night?

00:02:19.233 --> 00:02:20.636
Maybe she's got a lover
who's younger than her.

00:02:20.736 --> 00:02:23.241
- I couldn't care
less about Yamada.

00:02:23.341 --> 00:02:24.243
- It's bugging me.

00:02:24.343 --> 00:02:26.380
What kinda guy is he?

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.449
Gigolo?

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.984
- Whatever.

00:02:28.084 --> 00:02:29.353
So you're saying that this
Yamada woman

00:02:29.453 --> 00:02:32.226
told you the previous tenant
got murdered in our apartment?

00:02:32.326 --> 00:02:34.564
- Well, no, she didn't
exactly say that,

00:02:34.664 --> 00:02:36.334
but she did say they've
always had trouble

00:02:36.434 --> 00:02:38.371
with 707 and it must be a curse.

00:02:38.471 --> 00:02:40.075
So it's gotta be a murder.

00:02:40.175 --> 00:02:42.079
What else can it be?

00:02:42.179 --> 00:02:43.014
(Komatsu exclaiming)

00:02:43.114 --> 00:02:45.886
- [Nana] God dammit, go to bed!

00:02:45.987 --> 00:02:49.026
- Do you think I said
something to make her mad?

00:02:49.126 --> 00:02:50.863
(Nobu laughs)

00:02:50.963 --> 00:02:51.364
(Komatsu whines)

00:02:51.464 --> 00:02:53.769
- But you know, the rent
for this place is so cheap.

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:54.638
You might be right.

00:02:54.738 --> 00:02:57.009
I mean, I guess it
could have happened.

00:02:57.109 --> 00:02:57.944
- You think so?

00:02:58.044 --> 00:02:59.246
You really think
it was a murder?

00:02:59.346 --> 00:03:00.148
What if there's a ghost?

00:03:00.248 --> 00:03:01.551
I'm too scared to go to bed on
my own.

00:03:01.652 --> 00:03:03.856
- Hey, if you want,
I'd be more than happy

00:03:03.956 --> 00:03:04.824
to sleep with you, Nana.

00:03:04.925 --> 00:03:05.726
- What?

00:03:05.826 --> 00:03:06.662
No way!

00:03:06.762 --> 00:03:08.064
I have a boyfriend.

00:03:08.164 --> 00:03:09.768
I'm really flattered, but no!

00:03:09.868 --> 00:03:11.538
- I was just kidding.

00:03:12.907 --> 00:03:13.441
- Tell you what?

00:03:13.542 --> 00:03:14.544
I'll go sleep in Nana's room.

00:03:14.644 --> 00:03:17.082
That way you can sleep in my
bed, okay?

00:03:17.182 --> 00:03:18.752
You must be exhausted
after your trip.

00:03:18.852 --> 00:03:20.623
- You don't have to
give up your bed.

00:03:20.723 --> 00:03:21.457
I can crash out here.

00:03:21.558 --> 00:03:23.428
- (gasps) No, you can't do that.

00:03:23.529 --> 00:03:25.332
Nobu, you have to sleep
in my room tonight

00:03:25.432 --> 00:03:26.668
so that Nana won't have any
choice

00:03:26.768 --> 00:03:29.139
but to let me sleep
in her room with her.

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:30.910
There's no way I can
sleep on my own tonight

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.979
and I can't sleep with you.

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:34.651
So you gotta help me out here.

00:03:34.751 --> 00:03:36.788
- Well, I guess when you put it
like that.

00:03:36.888 --> 00:03:39.393
It looks like I'm gonna be
sleeping in your room tonight,

00:03:39.493 --> 00:03:40.863
whether Nana likes it or not.

00:03:40.963 --> 00:03:42.499
- [Komatsu] Thank you!

00:03:43.936 --> 00:03:45.205
- Wow, this bedroom's huge.

00:03:45.305 --> 00:03:46.440
You got so much space.

00:03:46.541 --> 00:03:47.977
- Yeah. We lucked out with this
place.

00:03:48.077 --> 00:03:49.013
I gotta work in the morning.

00:03:49.113 --> 00:03:50.115
So let me just grab some
clothes,

00:03:50.215 --> 00:03:51.952
then I don't have to wake you
tomorrow.

00:03:52.052 --> 00:03:53.454
- Ah, you work?

00:03:53.555 --> 00:03:54.056
- Yep.

00:03:54.156 --> 00:03:55.091
- Really?

00:03:55.191 --> 00:03:56.394
So you gotta get up early

00:03:56.494 --> 00:03:58.766
and we've kept you up all night?

00:03:58.866 --> 00:03:59.601
- Oh, don't worry about me.

00:03:59.701 --> 00:04:01.638
I don't have to leave
until around 10 o'clock.

00:04:01.738 --> 00:04:03.509
So I'll get a chance to
sleep in a little bit.

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:05.713
Besides, I had so much fun
tonight.

00:04:05.813 --> 00:04:07.884
I never had the chance to see a
live band

00:04:07.984 --> 00:04:09.621
up close and personal before.

00:04:09.721 --> 00:04:10.255
It was amazing.

00:04:10.355 --> 00:04:11.525
You guys were totally awesome.

00:04:11.625 --> 00:04:12.459
- You ain't seen nothin'.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.463
Just wait till you see us with
some drums

00:04:14.564 --> 00:04:16.133
and bass added to the mix.

00:04:16.233 --> 00:04:17.202
When it's just the two of us,

00:04:17.302 --> 00:04:18.672
you can't really call us a band.

00:04:18.772 --> 00:04:20.308
I can't wait to find some other
members

00:04:20.408 --> 00:04:22.312
so we can start playing real
gigs.

00:04:22.412 --> 00:04:24.483
- You need to get a
couple more people, huh?

00:04:24.584 --> 00:04:27.356
(sighs) I wish I knew how to
play the drums or something.

00:04:27.456 --> 00:04:29.059
Oh, but I guess I could
play the tambourine.

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:31.130
- (laughs) Tambourine.

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.334
- You know, the kind they have
at karaoke.

00:04:33.434 --> 00:04:34.804
Looks like a big ring.

00:04:34.904 --> 00:04:35.338
I rock at that.

00:04:35.438 --> 00:04:38.044
- Bet that means you got a
pretty good sense of rhythm.

00:04:38.144 --> 00:04:39.380
- Pretty good?

00:04:40.649 --> 00:04:43.822
- What I really want is
for Yasu to be our drummer.

00:04:43.922 --> 00:04:44.858
No matter where I look,

00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.093
it's gonna be pretty tough

00:04:46.193 --> 00:04:47.462
to find someone as good as him.

00:04:47.563 --> 00:04:49.099
- You mean Nana's friend Yasu?

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:50.402
I had no idea he was a drummer.

00:04:50.503 --> 00:04:52.239
Why doesn't he just
move down here as well?

00:04:52.339 --> 00:04:53.809
That would solve your problem.

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:54.343
- Hmph.

00:04:54.443 --> 00:04:56.948
He won't come, he's a working
stiff now.

00:04:57.049 --> 00:04:58.418
He also said he doesn't wanna
risk

00:04:58.519 --> 00:05:00.221
trying to make a living playing
music.

00:05:00.321 --> 00:05:01.958
- (laughs) What risk is that?

00:05:02.059 --> 00:05:03.027
- The way he looks,

00:05:03.127 --> 00:05:04.163
I think it's a bigger risk going

00:05:04.263 --> 00:05:06.434
into a courtroom than it
is appearing on stage.

00:05:06.535 --> 00:05:09.574
- (laughs) What about your bass
player?

00:05:09.674 --> 00:05:10.208
- Huh?

00:05:10.308 --> 00:05:11.210
- Who did you have on bass?

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.812
Where are they now?

00:05:11.912 --> 00:05:15.318
Maybe they could come
to Tokyo with you.

00:05:15.418 --> 00:05:17.690
- Well, that guy's in
another band now.

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.028
He was never officially
with us anyway.

00:05:20.128 --> 00:05:20.763
- How come?

00:05:20.863 --> 00:05:23.602
- Most of the time he played
in his own band back at home,

00:05:23.702 --> 00:05:24.871
but he used to come and help us
out

00:05:24.971 --> 00:05:26.908
by playing with us
when we had a gig.

00:05:27.008 --> 00:05:30.215
- I didn't know musicians
did that kind of stuff.

00:05:31.852 --> 00:05:35.258
- [Nobu] I guess Nana hasn't
really told you anything.

00:05:35.358 --> 00:05:36.227
- About what?

00:05:36.327 --> 00:05:37.864
- [Nobu] Like about the band and
stuff.

00:05:37.964 --> 00:05:39.266
- Oh, no.

00:05:40.703 --> 00:05:44.343
Nana doesn't like to talk
about herself too much.

00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:47.349
But after hearing her sing
tonight

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:49.086
I think I understand where she's
coming

00:05:49.186 --> 00:05:50.488
from a bit better now.

00:05:50.589 --> 00:05:51.525
I guess the reason why she moved

00:05:51.625 --> 00:05:54.697
to Tokyo was so she could make
it as a professional singer.

00:05:54.798 --> 00:05:56.000
- Yeah.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.570
That's always been her dream.

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:00.543
To be able to make a
living off her singing.

00:06:00.643 --> 00:06:02.914
She was pretty well known back
at home.

00:06:03.014 --> 00:06:05.385
Lots of crazy fans and stuff.

00:06:05.485 --> 00:06:07.590
She needs to start singing here.

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:10.996
I just know Tokyo will
go wild for her.

00:06:13.234 --> 00:06:14.403
- [Komatsu] Totally.

00:06:14.504 --> 00:06:16.808
We need to get her out
there singing on stage.

00:06:16.908 --> 00:06:19.814
First, we need to find some
new members for the band.

00:06:19.914 --> 00:06:21.283
How hard can that be?

00:06:21.383 --> 00:06:22.319
Then they can play live

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:24.891
and everyone will fall in
love with Nana's voice.

00:06:24.991 --> 00:06:28.565
She'll probably even get picked
up by a major record label!

00:06:32.172 --> 00:06:34.209
Hey Nana, are you asleep?

00:06:34.309 --> 00:06:34.811
- Yes.

00:06:34.911 --> 00:06:36.147
- (giggles) You're not asleep or
else

00:06:36.247 --> 00:06:37.984
how could you answer my
question?

00:06:38.084 --> 00:06:39.787
- I talk in my sleep.

00:06:41.056 --> 00:06:41.725
- This is freaky.

00:06:41.825 --> 00:06:44.163
My heart's beating so hard I
can't sleep.

00:06:44.263 --> 00:06:45.933
- You still scared of the ghost?

00:06:46.033 --> 00:06:46.968
You big baby?

00:06:47.068 --> 00:06:47.837
- No, I'm not scared.

00:06:47.937 --> 00:06:50.041
It's more like excitement about
something.

00:06:50.141 --> 00:06:51.578
- Oh? Listen.

00:06:51.678 --> 00:06:52.713
I hate to break it to you,

00:06:52.814 --> 00:06:54.684
but I don't do it with girls,
okay?

00:06:54.784 --> 00:06:57.022
- I don't mean that kind of
excitement.

00:06:57.122 --> 00:06:59.026
- Would you just shut up
already?

00:06:59.126 --> 00:07:00.128
If you can't get to sleep,

00:07:00.228 --> 00:07:01.665
I'm gonna kick you out.

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:12.720
- Hey Nana, do you think you
might need

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:14.591
a tambourine player in the band?

00:07:14.691 --> 00:07:15.693
- No.

00:07:16.628 --> 00:07:18.030
- [Komatsu] I've never been so
psyched

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:20.001
about something in my life.

00:07:21.337 --> 00:07:24.009
- Hm?

00:07:24.109 --> 00:07:26.013
What the hell's this?

00:07:27.182 --> 00:07:28.484
- Huh? Ah.

00:07:31.123 --> 00:07:32.025
Shoji!

00:07:32.125 --> 00:07:34.196
You're here just in time.

00:07:34.296 --> 00:07:35.566
I was about to go to Jackson's.

00:07:35.666 --> 00:07:36.735
Do you wanna come with me?

00:07:36.835 --> 00:07:39.339
- Sure. What's up with this
flyer?

00:07:39.439 --> 00:07:40.241
Did you do it?

00:07:40.341 --> 00:07:41.343
It's totally your style.

00:07:41.443 --> 00:07:42.980
I recognize the way you draw the
eyes.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:46.287
- Yep. Don't they look like Nana
and Nobu?

00:07:46.387 --> 00:07:49.326
- Hmm. Who's this Nobu?

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:53.467
She wants to sing
professionally?

00:07:53.569 --> 00:07:55.405
Well, that's a tall order.

00:07:55.506 --> 00:07:58.211
- I know, but I totally
think she should go for it.

00:07:58.311 --> 00:08:00.081
- Well, that's great if she
thinks

00:08:00.181 --> 00:08:01.551
she can actually make it,

00:08:01.651 --> 00:08:03.254
but I'm not so sure success is

00:08:03.354 --> 00:08:04.557
gonna come as easy as you think.

00:08:04.657 --> 00:08:05.993
What if she doesn't make it?

00:08:06.093 --> 00:08:06.861
- It's all cool.

00:08:06.962 --> 00:08:08.431
I mean, everything's
been going right

00:08:08.532 --> 00:08:10.703
ever since I decided
to move to Tokyo.

00:08:10.803 --> 00:08:13.942
- I don't think this
is really about you.

00:08:14.042 --> 00:08:14.443
- [Komatsu] Whatever.

00:08:14.544 --> 00:08:16.581
Wanna go to karaoke
tonight with me and Nana?

00:08:16.681 --> 00:08:17.817
You gotta hear her sing

00:08:17.917 --> 00:08:20.355
and I'll be there playing the
tambourine.

00:08:20.455 --> 00:08:22.292
- [Shoji] Sorry, I can't.

00:08:22.392 --> 00:08:24.062
I gotta work late tonight.

00:08:24.162 --> 00:08:25.198
- Not again.

00:08:25.298 --> 00:08:27.637
Why are you always working so
much?

00:08:27.737 --> 00:08:29.874
Your parents send you money,
don't they?

00:08:29.974 --> 00:08:31.645
- The measly amount they send me
is

00:08:31.745 --> 00:08:33.314
nowhere near enough to live on.

00:08:33.414 --> 00:08:34.283
And once school starts,

00:08:34.383 --> 00:08:35.653
I won't have as much time to
work.

00:08:35.753 --> 00:08:38.024
So I gotta put in as
many hours as I can now

00:08:38.124 --> 00:08:39.192
to save up some cash.

00:08:39.293 --> 00:08:39.827
- You're spending it all

00:08:39.928 --> 00:08:41.631
on your other girlfriend
Sachiko.

00:08:41.731 --> 00:08:43.568
Designer bags, designer shoes.

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:45.940
- Yeah. She's got
expensive taste.

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:46.908
(Komatsu cries)

00:08:47.008 --> 00:08:47.910
I'm joking, I'm joking.

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:49.547
You're the one who started
it all.

00:08:49.647 --> 00:08:50.582
- Yeah, but when I moved all the
way

00:08:50.683 --> 00:08:52.285
to Tokyo was to be with you.

00:08:52.385 --> 00:08:53.522
And now I hardly ever see you.

00:08:53.622 --> 00:08:55.726
You're always working day in,
day out.

00:08:55.826 --> 00:08:58.097
I just wish you'd make some
time for me, that's all.

00:08:58.197 --> 00:08:58.732
- Oh, come on.

00:08:58.832 --> 00:09:00.268
Now you're being ridiculous.

00:09:00.368 --> 00:09:01.303
I do make time for you.

00:09:01.403 --> 00:09:02.807
It was you who bailed out early
on me

00:09:02.907 --> 00:09:04.777
last time we were together.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:09.219
Maybe you should try
to consider how I feel.

00:09:09.319 --> 00:09:10.823
Why should I be the one
who has to work

00:09:10.923 --> 00:09:12.994
around your schedule
all the time?

00:09:13.094 --> 00:09:16.166
(sad piano music)

00:09:18.605 --> 00:09:20.475
- [Koichi] Hey, I hate to
interrupt,

00:09:20.576 --> 00:09:22.580
but your Jackson burger's ready.

00:09:24.349 --> 00:09:25.485
- Koichi Sato.

00:09:25.586 --> 00:09:26.253
- [Koichi] What?

00:09:26.353 --> 00:09:27.155
- I need your help with
something.

00:09:27.255 --> 00:09:29.594
My friends are looking for
new members for their band.

00:09:29.694 --> 00:09:31.263
So I was wondering if
you could put this flyer

00:09:31.363 --> 00:09:32.299
up in the restaurant for me.

00:09:32.399 --> 00:09:33.769
- Nana, you can't do that.

00:09:33.869 --> 00:09:35.471
He doesn't know those guys.

00:09:35.572 --> 00:09:36.407
And the customers in this place

00:09:36.508 --> 00:09:38.144
aren't gonna be interested
in a punk band.

00:09:38.244 --> 00:09:38.979
- Why not?

00:09:39.079 --> 00:09:41.150
- [Koichi] No, it's
cool with me.

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:42.485
Nana's as a regular customer.

00:09:42.586 --> 00:09:43.522
- You'll put it up?

00:09:43.622 --> 00:09:44.524
That's awesome.

00:09:44.624 --> 00:09:45.759
If anyone shows any interest,

00:09:45.859 --> 00:09:47.429
give them my cell phone
number, okay?

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:50.134
Gimme a pen and I'll
write it down for you.

00:09:53.875 --> 00:09:56.581
- I gotta go to work now.

00:09:58.952 --> 00:09:59.486
Oh.

00:09:59.587 --> 00:10:00.556
I just remembered.

00:10:00.656 --> 00:10:03.260
Did you text message
me last night?

00:10:03.361 --> 00:10:04.597
- Huh?

00:10:05.632 --> 00:10:06.433
- No biggie.

00:10:06.534 --> 00:10:08.572
Guess it wasn't anything
important.

00:10:08.672 --> 00:10:09.841
I must have fallen asleep

00:10:09.941 --> 00:10:11.845
and didn't hear the phone beep.

00:10:11.945 --> 00:10:12.947
Sorry.

00:10:16.487 --> 00:10:18.725
- Did I text him last night?

00:10:18.825 --> 00:10:20.161
What did I write?

00:10:23.835 --> 00:10:26.006
(gasps)

00:10:26.106 --> 00:10:27.643
Oh man, I suck.

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:31.651
I don't know why
I sent him that.

00:10:31.751 --> 00:10:34.189
I've gotten used to
him spoiling me.

00:10:34.289 --> 00:10:37.763
The worst is I don't
even remember sending it.

00:10:37.863 --> 00:10:39.534
Shoji was probably feeling bad

00:10:39.634 --> 00:10:41.871
because he didn't call me back.

00:10:41.971 --> 00:10:45.044
That must have been why
he came to see me at work.

00:10:48.284 --> 00:10:50.656
All I do is think about myself.

00:10:50.756 --> 00:10:51.490
- [Flashback Komatsu]
But I just wish you'd

00:10:51.591 --> 00:10:53.662
make some time for me,
that's all!

00:10:54.997 --> 00:10:57.102
- Why am I such a selfish jerk?

00:10:57.202 --> 00:10:58.237
Loser!

00:11:00.374 --> 00:11:01.811
- [Flashback Shoji] Why
should I be the one who has

00:11:01.911 --> 00:11:04.650
to work around your schedule
all the time?

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:10.629
- I know, I'll drop by his
work today

00:11:10.729 --> 00:11:12.767
and I'll tell him I'm sorry.

00:11:13.434 --> 00:11:13.769
- [Passerby] Excuse me.

00:11:13.869 --> 00:11:16.073
- It'll be kind of fun to
see Shoji in his uniform.

00:11:16.173 --> 00:11:17.710
I bet he looks really hot.
- [Passerby] Uh, hello?

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:19.045
- I'll wait until
he gets off work,

00:11:19.146 --> 00:11:20.114
and then when we're back at his
place,

00:11:20.214 --> 00:11:21.584
I'll rip that uniform off him
- [Passerby] Excuse me, miss?

00:11:21.684 --> 00:11:23.588
- and then I'll make
it up to him.

00:11:23.688 --> 00:11:25.926
A totally genius plan.
- [Passerby] Um.

00:11:26.026 --> 00:11:26.561
- Oh, I'm sorry.

00:11:26.661 --> 00:11:27.262
How can I help you?

00:11:27.362 --> 00:11:30.836
- I was looking at the flyer
you've got in the window.

00:11:32.138 --> 00:11:32.940
- Wow, so soon?

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.877
Oh my god, he's
a teenage hottie!

00:11:34.977 --> 00:11:37.081
Sometimes life is too good.

00:11:37.182 --> 00:11:38.250
- So I'm wondering...

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:38.885
- Sorry, Shoji.

00:11:38.985 --> 00:11:39.987
I'm not gonna make it tonight.

00:11:40.087 --> 00:11:42.726
I'll make it up to you some
other time.

00:11:44.831 --> 00:11:47.102
- [Shoji] Hope you enjoy your
meal.

00:11:47.202 --> 00:11:48.972
Oh, it's crazy busy in here
today.

00:11:49.072 --> 00:11:51.778
This place is seriously
understaffed.

00:11:54.449 --> 00:11:55.151
- Hey, Shoji.

00:11:55.251 --> 00:11:55.819
You got a minute?

00:11:55.919 --> 00:11:56.888
We got a new waitress starting
today.

00:11:56.988 --> 00:11:58.558
Can you look after her,
show her around?

00:11:58.658 --> 00:12:00.094
- About time.

00:12:00.194 --> 00:12:01.430
Sure.

00:12:01.531 --> 00:12:04.102
Whoa, and she's a babe.

00:12:04.202 --> 00:12:05.338
It's nice to meet you.

00:12:05.438 --> 00:12:06.808
I'm show Shoji Endo.

00:12:06.908 --> 00:12:08.612
- I'm Sachiko Kawamura.

00:12:08.712 --> 00:12:10.448
Nice to meet you too.

00:12:10.549 --> 00:12:11.784
- Hm.

00:12:12.452 --> 00:12:13.254
What was your name?

00:12:13.354 --> 00:12:14.690
- Sachiko.

00:12:15.592 --> 00:12:16.661
- Really?

00:12:16.761 --> 00:12:19.199
Do you like designer
bags and shoes?

00:12:19.299 --> 00:12:20.334
- Huh?

00:12:26.246 --> 00:12:28.317
- Seriously, what the hell is
this for?

00:12:28.417 --> 00:12:31.423
You don't have to put together
a resume just to join a band.

00:12:31.524 --> 00:12:32.091
- Well, why not?

00:12:32.192 --> 00:12:34.229
I thought you might wanna
know some background info

00:12:34.329 --> 00:12:36.768
on him before you let
him try out for the band.

00:12:36.868 --> 00:12:39.507
- What can a piece of paper
tell you about someone?

00:12:39.607 --> 00:12:41.678
Absolutely nothing.

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:43.414
(Nobu exclaims)

00:12:43.515 --> 00:12:44.884
- Nana, what are you doing?

00:12:44.984 --> 00:12:47.255
- All I wanna know is how
desperate you are to play

00:12:47.355 --> 00:12:50.194
and whether you can rock
the house when you do.

00:12:50.829 --> 00:12:51.764
- You are too cool.

00:12:51.865 --> 00:12:53.535
- I really hope you're
not making fun of me.

00:12:53.635 --> 00:12:54.604
- No, no, I swear.

00:12:54.704 --> 00:12:55.839
I'm totally serious.

00:12:55.939 --> 00:12:56.741
Nana said you were cool,

00:12:56.841 --> 00:12:57.943
but now that I've met you in
person

00:12:58.043 --> 00:12:59.814
your even cooler than
she described.

00:12:59.914 --> 00:13:00.716
- [Komatsu] I know, right?

00:13:00.816 --> 00:13:02.686
Still, she didn't have
to burn your resume.

00:13:02.786 --> 00:13:03.822
You could have burned the place
down

00:13:03.922 --> 00:13:05.726
and that wouldn't have been so
cool.

00:13:05.826 --> 00:13:06.360
(Nana sighs)

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:08.598
- You have got to let
me play with you guys.

00:13:08.698 --> 00:13:10.301
- That depends if you're any
good.

00:13:10.401 --> 00:13:12.506
Play something and let
me hear what you got.

00:13:12.606 --> 00:13:13.307
- Okay!

00:13:13.407 --> 00:13:13.942
- Hold on, pretty boy.

00:13:14.042 --> 00:13:14.877
You can't play here.

00:13:14.977 --> 00:13:15.712
If you do, miss Yamada,

00:13:15.812 --> 00:13:18.217
our crazy neighbor's
gonna freak out on us.

00:13:18.317 --> 00:13:18.785
- Oh, whatever.

00:13:18.885 --> 00:13:20.221
He's just gonna slap a little
bass.

00:13:20.321 --> 00:13:20.989
- No way.

00:13:21.089 --> 00:13:22.058
Do you wanna get us kicked out?

00:13:22.158 --> 00:13:24.797
If that happens, we're both
gonna be totally screwed.

00:13:24.897 --> 00:13:27.368
And that's exactly what
the demon lord wants.

00:13:27.468 --> 00:13:28.605
- Demon lord?

00:13:28.705 --> 00:13:30.542
- Then go find us somewhere to
practice.

00:13:30.642 --> 00:13:31.511
- Who, me?

00:13:31.611 --> 00:13:33.682
- Hey, I know a rehearsal studio
nearby

00:13:33.782 --> 00:13:35.251
that we could rent out really
cheap.

00:13:35.351 --> 00:13:37.388
- Really? This kid could be
useful.

00:13:37.488 --> 00:13:39.660
- I'll just give them a call
and see if they're open.

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:40.328
And after I've played for you,

00:13:40.428 --> 00:13:43.768
I'd love to get a chance
to hear you guys play too.

00:13:46.173 --> 00:13:47.342
Oh, hello.

00:13:47.442 --> 00:13:49.479
- There's no way that kid's 18.

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:50.983
I'd put him at 16 tops.

00:13:51.083 --> 00:13:52.586
Makes me wonder what
else he's lying about.

00:13:52.686 --> 00:13:55.759
- Oh, so you did read his
resume before destroying it.

00:13:55.859 --> 00:13:58.397
- Awesome. It's available.

00:13:58.497 --> 00:13:59.332
- He's so cute.

00:13:59.432 --> 00:14:02.272
- He better not still be in
grade school.

00:14:04.543 --> 00:14:08.752
- Wow. I've never been in
a rehearsal studio before.

00:14:10.388 --> 00:14:13.327
(Komatsu laughs)

00:14:20.976 --> 00:14:23.213
- Let's start playing
and see what happens.

00:14:23.314 --> 00:14:23.815
- [Komatsu] Huh?

00:14:23.915 --> 00:14:26.219
But Shinichi doesn't
know any of your songs.

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.390
- You know how to read music or
what?

00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:29.660
- Yeah, sure I do.

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:33.167
(instrument tuning)

00:14:37.676 --> 00:14:39.379
- So, you ready?

00:14:39.479 --> 00:14:42.151
- Yeah, let's do this.

00:14:42.251 --> 00:14:44.155
- Hmph, okay.

00:14:44.255 --> 00:14:44.890
One, two.

00:14:44.991 --> 00:14:47.930
(rock music)

00:15:24.102 --> 00:15:25.371
- [Komatsu] This is amazing.

00:15:25.471 --> 00:15:27.342
So totally amazing.

00:15:33.287 --> 00:15:35.559
- [Komatsu] It's like they
were born to play together.

00:15:35.659 --> 00:15:37.930
Way to go, pretty boy.

00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:40.234
Oh, thank god he can actually
play.

00:15:49.019 --> 00:15:51.891
(bass solo)

00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:56.567
(Nana gasps)

00:15:56.667 --> 00:15:58.605
- [Komatsu] Now what?

00:15:58.705 --> 00:15:59.940
- Huh?

00:16:01.243 --> 00:16:02.078
- Ow!

00:16:02.178 --> 00:16:03.948
- [Komatsu] Nana!
- Oh, man. Sorry guys.

00:16:04.049 --> 00:16:05.519
Did I screw up or something?

00:16:05.619 --> 00:16:06.888
- Nah, dude, not at all.

00:16:06.988 --> 00:16:07.956
You're doing great.

00:16:08.057 --> 00:16:09.760
Way better than we expected.

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:10.962
What do you say, Nana?

00:16:11.063 --> 00:16:12.098
He's good, right?

00:16:12.198 --> 00:16:13.000
Let's let him join.

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:15.605
- [Nana] So, it's Shinichi,
right?

00:16:15.706 --> 00:16:16.841
- That's right.

00:16:16.941 --> 00:16:19.547
- Tell me who your
favorite bass player is.

00:16:19.647 --> 00:16:21.049
- Ren Honjo.

00:16:21.951 --> 00:16:22.953
(Nana laughs sadly)

00:16:23.053 --> 00:16:25.992
(Nobu sighs)

00:16:29.466 --> 00:16:31.738
- Isn't that the guy
who plays with Trapnest?

00:16:31.838 --> 00:16:32.606
- Yeah.

00:16:32.706 --> 00:16:33.240
- This is cool.

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:35.712
They're one of my favorite
bands.

00:16:35.812 --> 00:16:36.881
I'm even in their fan club.

00:16:36.981 --> 00:16:38.785
Although I think Takumi is the
best.

00:16:38.885 --> 00:16:39.987
- Wow. Really?

00:16:40.087 --> 00:16:41.423
Even though I like Trapnest,

00:16:41.524 --> 00:16:42.125
I mostly listen to them

00:16:42.225 --> 00:16:43.995
because I'm a big fan of Ren's.

00:16:44.095 --> 00:16:45.565
I played guitar for a long time

00:16:45.665 --> 00:16:46.667
but when I heard him play,

00:16:46.768 --> 00:16:48.170
I decided to switch to bass.

00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:50.441
- [Komatsu] But Ren plays lead
guitar.

00:16:50.542 --> 00:16:51.209
Takumi's on bass.

00:16:51.309 --> 00:16:53.147
- [Shinichi] Didn't you
know? Ren plays the bass too.

00:16:53.247 --> 00:16:54.683
And he totally rocks at it.

00:16:54.784 --> 00:16:55.317
- [Komatsu] Really?

00:16:55.418 --> 00:16:58.090
- Yeah, he played bass on
a sex pistols tribute album

00:16:58.190 --> 00:16:59.994
that I used to listen
to all the time.

00:17:00.094 --> 00:17:01.196
It totally kicks ass.

00:17:01.296 --> 00:17:02.398
You should give it a listen.

00:17:02.498 --> 00:17:03.868
- Wow. I never knew.

00:17:03.968 --> 00:17:05.237
Guess I gotta do better
homework.

00:17:05.337 --> 00:17:06.774
- So that's why you played like
Ren.

00:17:06.874 --> 00:17:07.676
- Is that a problem?

00:17:07.776 --> 00:17:08.343
I'm sorry.

00:17:08.444 --> 00:17:09.747
I can play other styles if you
want.

00:17:09.847 --> 00:17:10.448
- Nah, it's cool.

00:17:10.549 --> 00:17:13.721
Your style of playing's easy
to sing with.

00:17:13.822 --> 00:17:15.559
You wanna join the band?

00:17:15.659 --> 00:17:16.661
- I'd love to.

00:17:16.761 --> 00:17:17.529
You're an amazing singer

00:17:17.629 --> 00:17:20.836
and I totally dig Nobu's
riffs on the guitar.

00:17:20.936 --> 00:17:22.038
- [Nana] Before you say yes,

00:17:22.138 --> 00:17:24.977
I want you to promise
me one thing.

00:17:25.077 --> 00:17:26.681
And if you can't
promise to do it,

00:17:26.781 --> 00:17:28.952
you have to split now.

00:17:29.052 --> 00:17:32.458
Play better than Ren, all right?

00:17:35.064 --> 00:17:38.003
(rock music)

00:17:39.005 --> 00:17:39.807
- Yes, ma'am.

00:17:39.907 --> 00:17:41.443
Your wish is my command.

00:17:45.919 --> 00:17:46.888
- [Komatsu] Isn't this great?

00:17:46.988 --> 00:17:48.758
I never expected us to
find someone this fast,

00:17:48.858 --> 00:17:50.862
and he's so cute.

00:17:50.962 --> 00:17:51.429
And who discovered him?

00:17:51.531 --> 00:17:53.066
Who's the one who made it
happen?

00:17:53.167 --> 00:17:55.237
- Our own little talent scout.

00:17:55.337 --> 00:17:56.607
- What do you want me to do?

00:17:56.707 --> 00:17:58.076
Bake you a cake?

00:17:58.177 --> 00:17:58.878
(Komatsu gasps)

00:17:58.978 --> 00:17:59.814
- How else can I thank you?

00:17:59.914 --> 00:18:01.951
- Hey, don't throw that on the
ground.

00:18:02.051 --> 00:18:03.153
Honestly.

00:18:03.253 --> 00:18:05.057
- Thank you, Hachiko.

00:18:17.983 --> 00:18:20.187
- I thought you said
you weren't into girls.

00:18:20.287 --> 00:18:21.624
You can't just do that to me.

00:18:21.724 --> 00:18:22.593
And besides, I have a boyfriend.

00:18:22.693 --> 00:18:24.062
- What a drama queen.

00:18:24.162 --> 00:18:25.164
It was just a kiss.

00:18:25.264 --> 00:18:26.968
I mean, it's not
like she's a virgin.

00:18:27.068 --> 00:18:28.805
- You never change, do you?

00:18:28.905 --> 00:18:29.405
- Sorry, Shoji.

00:18:29.507 --> 00:18:31.811
I just made out with
someone else,

00:18:31.911 --> 00:18:32.478
but it was a girl

00:18:32.579 --> 00:18:35.017
so it doesn't really count,
right?

00:18:43.066 --> 00:18:44.302
- Huh?

00:18:45.772 --> 00:18:48.545
(dog barking)

00:18:51.984 --> 00:18:52.819
- Oh, man.

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:55.257
I hope she doesn't think
I'm a stalker.

00:18:58.063 --> 00:18:59.633
Excuse me, miss Kawamura.

00:18:59.733 --> 00:19:01.571
(Sachiko screams)

00:19:01.671 --> 00:19:02.238
Calm down.

00:19:02.338 --> 00:19:04.042
I won't hurt you.

00:19:04.142 --> 00:19:06.279
- Oh, thank God it's
just you, Shoji.

00:19:06.379 --> 00:19:09.620
Sorry, you freaked me out.

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:11.991
- You shouldn't be walking
down the street on your own.

00:19:12.091 --> 00:19:13.093
It's not safe.

00:19:13.193 --> 00:19:15.164
- But it's the quickest
way to the station.

00:19:15.264 --> 00:19:16.132
And if I don't hurry,

00:19:16.233 --> 00:19:17.836
I'm gonna miss the last train.

00:19:17.936 --> 00:19:19.339
- Yeah. Same with me.

00:19:19.439 --> 00:19:20.909
You wanna run for it together?

00:19:21.009 --> 00:19:22.546
- Okay.

00:19:22.646 --> 00:19:25.919
- I wonder if Sachiko
takes the same train as me.

00:19:26.019 --> 00:19:28.591
(ringing)

00:19:32.398 --> 00:19:33.233
- That was close.

00:19:33.333 --> 00:19:34.335
We only just made it.

00:19:34.435 --> 00:19:38.076
- Don't tell me you have the
same stop as me too, Sachiko.

00:19:39.747 --> 00:19:42.686
- So which stop are you
getting off at, Shoji?

00:19:42.786 --> 00:19:43.855
- Mine's the third one along.

00:19:43.955 --> 00:19:46.426
And you, Sa- Miss Kawamura?

00:19:46.527 --> 00:19:47.461
- The second.

00:19:47.562 --> 00:19:49.432
- (sighs) Do you think you'll be
alright

00:19:49.533 --> 00:19:51.369
walking home from the station on
your own?

00:19:51.469 --> 00:19:52.606
- Yeah, my building's right

00:19:52.706 --> 00:19:54.710
across the street from the
station.

00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:55.645
- That's good.

00:19:55.745 --> 00:19:57.381
So you'll be okay?

00:19:58.150 --> 00:19:59.052
Huh?

00:19:59.152 --> 00:20:00.722
- Thanks for the offer, Shoji.

00:20:00.822 --> 00:20:02.526
That was very sweet of you.

00:20:05.765 --> 00:20:06.834
Good night!

00:20:09.439 --> 00:20:11.944
- She's such a cutie, that
Sachiko.

00:20:12.044 --> 00:20:14.449
Not like virtual Sachiko.

00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:15.785
This is bad.

00:20:15.885 --> 00:20:17.656
I'd better stay away from her.

00:20:24.937 --> 00:20:26.941
- Ah, that was so much fun!

00:20:27.041 --> 00:20:28.176
- Stop taking all the covers.

00:20:28.276 --> 00:20:29.580
It's cold.

00:20:34.823 --> 00:20:36.393
- Listen, I don't want
you crossing this line

00:20:36.493 --> 00:20:37.963
onto my side of the bed, okay?

00:20:38.063 --> 00:20:39.165
- Who's bed is this anyways?

00:20:39.265 --> 00:20:41.537
If you don't like it, sleep on
the floor.

00:20:41.637 --> 00:20:43.140
- Hm.

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:44.475
- [Nana] Ooh.

00:20:44.576 --> 00:20:45.979
- Come on!

00:20:46.079 --> 00:20:47.148
Hey!

00:20:47.248 --> 00:20:48.417
- Ooh, I'm over the line!

00:20:48.518 --> 00:20:49.520
What are you gonna do about it,
huh?

00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:50.989
(Nana and Komatsu laughing)

00:20:51.089 --> 00:20:53.327
- [Komatsu] Looking back on it
now,

00:20:53.427 --> 00:20:56.032
the way I felt about you, Nana,

00:20:56.132 --> 00:20:58.805
felt a lot like falling in love.

00:20:58.905 --> 00:21:01.476
Even though in many ways
I was still a child,

00:21:01.577 --> 00:21:05.652
you helped me learn to fend
for myself in the real world.

00:21:05.752 --> 00:21:09.392
With you, my life was full of
sweet dreams

00:21:09.492 --> 00:21:13.568
and it felt like the pure
bliss of a first love.
