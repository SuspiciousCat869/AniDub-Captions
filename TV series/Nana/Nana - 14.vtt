00:00:02.254 --> 00:00:03.322
- [Nana] The real reason I chose

00:00:03.422 --> 00:00:05.694
that job was so I could
have the weekends off.

00:00:05.795 --> 00:00:08.032
I couldn't have done
that working in a store.

00:00:08.132 --> 00:00:10.871
Shoji was so busy with school
and work during the week

00:00:10.971 --> 00:00:13.409
that it was hard to spend time
together.

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:14.378
That's why I wanted to make

00:00:14.478 --> 00:00:17.250
as much time for him as
possible.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.758
(lively rock music)

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:32.480
(lively rock music continues)

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.555
(birds chirping)

00:01:59.656 --> 00:02:03.029
- Kyosuke, have you ever
cheated on anyone before?

00:02:03.129 --> 00:02:06.368
- Huh?
(noodles splashing)

00:02:06.468 --> 00:02:09.642
- You and Sachiko.

00:02:09.742 --> 00:02:12.447
- Huh? The defendant must
answer the question as asked!

00:02:12.548 --> 00:02:14.284
- You're the one who's acting
guilty, man.

00:02:14.384 --> 00:02:15.320
(object clatters)

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.223
I've never cheated on
any of my girlfriends.

00:02:17.324 --> 00:02:18.927
(table bangs)
- You liar!

00:02:19.027 --> 00:02:20.731
You were a total slime ball to
the girls

00:02:20.831 --> 00:02:22.233
you messed around with in
high school,

00:02:22.334 --> 00:02:24.171
and don't try to deny it!

00:02:24.271 --> 00:02:24.806
- You think so, huh?

00:02:24.906 --> 00:02:26.442
- Don't play dumb!
(table bangs)

00:02:26.543 --> 00:02:28.647
There was that college
girl you met at the club.

00:02:28.747 --> 00:02:30.416
Then there was the nurse from
the hospital

00:02:30.517 --> 00:02:31.753
after you crashed your
motorcycle.

00:02:31.853 --> 00:02:33.724
And let's not forget Tamaru's
sister.

00:02:33.824 --> 00:02:35.561
(noodles spatters)
(pan clatters)

00:02:35.661 --> 00:02:37.297
- That's a pretty good memory
you got.

00:02:37.397 --> 00:02:38.634
I never knew you were so
jealous.

00:02:38.734 --> 00:02:40.804
- Anyway, there's no way
a player

00:02:40.904 --> 00:02:42.775
with that kind of history
has never cheated!

00:02:42.875 --> 00:02:46.281
- Man, you want a partner
in crime real bad.

00:02:46.382 --> 00:02:48.620
But that does bring back
memories.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.427
I was in my prime then. I
could get any girl I wanted.

00:02:52.528 --> 00:02:54.097
My popularity's been declining
lately.

00:02:54.197 --> 00:02:57.237
- But if you could do it,
you would, wouldn't you?

00:02:57.337 --> 00:02:58.940
(lighter clicks)

00:02:59.041 --> 00:02:59.642
- [Kyosuke] No.

00:02:59.742 --> 00:03:01.880
- But why not? Is it 'cause
you're scared of Junko?

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.550
I guess you don't want
to get on the bad side

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.754
of that ex-gangster, huh?

00:03:05.854 --> 00:03:09.094
- I wouldn't cheat 'cause
I'm scared of losing Junko.

00:03:12.868 --> 00:03:14.471
May I please have the check?

00:03:14.572 --> 00:03:15.473
- [Cook] You bet.

00:03:15.574 --> 00:03:17.243
(buttons clicking)

00:03:17.344 --> 00:03:19.348
(cash register rings)

00:03:19.448 --> 00:03:24.692
(horn honks)
(engine rumbling)

00:03:24.792 --> 00:03:26.963
- Oh, I hate her! She
really pisses me off!

00:03:27.063 --> 00:03:29.702
It's almost like she
just wants to torture me.

00:03:29.802 --> 00:03:31.706
"Miss Komatsu, you can't
even make a cup of tea.

00:03:31.806 --> 00:03:34.512
If you find a man willing to
marry you, then God help him."

00:03:34.612 --> 00:03:35.848
You can talk, Ms. Sakagami.

00:03:35.948 --> 00:03:37.685
Still not married at 38, old
maid!

00:03:37.785 --> 00:03:39.989
- [Shoji] Uh-huh.

00:03:40.858 --> 00:03:41.793
- What's up with you, Shoji?

00:03:41.893 --> 00:03:43.329
You seem kind of down in the
dumps.

00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:47.137
- Well, it's just that you seem
to be getting so aggressive.

00:03:47.237 --> 00:03:50.143
Is that something you picked
up from your roommate?

00:03:50.243 --> 00:03:51.646
- No, I'm really pissed off!

00:03:51.746 --> 00:03:52.882
They think they're a big
publisher,

00:03:52.982 --> 00:03:54.552
but I just do a bunch of crap.

00:03:54.652 --> 00:03:56.923
(Nana gulping)

00:03:57.023 --> 00:03:59.294
They treat me like dirt
and then make me stay late.

00:03:59.394 --> 00:04:00.597
They even made me work all
weekend

00:04:00.698 --> 00:04:03.035
'cause of their stupid proofing
deadlines.

00:04:03.135 --> 00:04:04.539
So much for me getting weekends
off.

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:07.043
I hate it. I want to quit.

00:04:07.978 --> 00:04:09.448
- So why don't you quit, then?

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:10.984
- It's not that easy. I'm not a
quitter.

00:04:11.085 --> 00:04:13.523
- But you just said you hate
the job and you want to leave.

00:04:13.623 --> 00:04:15.193
- [Nana] Yeah, I know, but I
can't.

00:04:15.293 --> 00:04:17.631
I only just started this
job and if I quit so soon,

00:04:17.732 --> 00:04:19.869
it might make it hard for
me to find another one.

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:22.775
Besides, who knows if I'd even
be able to get another one?

00:04:22.875 --> 00:04:25.981
And I have to make money so I
can eat.

00:04:26.081 --> 00:04:28.285
- [Shoji] Then you just
got to deal with it.

00:04:28.386 --> 00:04:29.622
- [Nana] Hmm.

00:04:32.528 --> 00:04:34.999
Yeah, well, it's okay for you,
Shoji.

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:36.101
- [Shoji] Huh?

00:04:36.201 --> 00:04:39.074
- You've got it made. You got
into the school you wanted.

00:04:39.174 --> 00:04:41.211
Your parents help you out with
money.

00:04:41.311 --> 00:04:42.347
You can buy yourself a computer.

00:04:42.447 --> 00:04:45.888
It seems you always have
enough money to get by, right?

00:04:48.058 --> 00:04:50.798
(Nana gulps)

00:04:54.772 --> 00:04:57.812
(gentle music)

00:04:59.381 --> 00:05:03.155
That was awful of me. Why
did I stay that stuff?

00:05:03.255 --> 00:05:07.330
But I can't always be nice
and cute when I'm with Shoji.

00:05:09.167 --> 00:05:12.842
(gentle music continues)

00:05:20.791 --> 00:05:23.295
If he doesn't invite me back to
his place,

00:05:23.395 --> 00:05:25.166
we're not gonna be to make up.

00:05:26.335 --> 00:05:30.409
(gentle music continues)

00:05:30.511 --> 00:05:31.011
Want to come up?

00:05:31.111 --> 00:05:33.683
Nana's at work, so we'll
have the place to ourselves.

00:05:33.783 --> 00:05:34.852
- Nah, that's okay.

00:05:34.952 --> 00:05:38.058
Don't you have to start
work early tomorrow?

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:39.261
Well, goodnight.

00:05:40.831 --> 00:05:42.768
- [Nana] I wish you
wouldn't smile like that,

00:05:42.868 --> 00:05:45.874
not when I know you're mad at
me.

00:05:47.343 --> 00:05:52.120
How can I apologize if
you won't even talk to me?

00:05:54.992 --> 00:05:57.030
- Miss Komatsu, how long does it
take

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:58.633
to sort through some postcards?

00:05:58.733 --> 00:06:00.904
You really are slow.

00:06:01.004 --> 00:06:02.942
- I'm so sorry, Ms. Sakagami.

00:06:03.042 --> 00:06:04.411
- [Ms. Sakagami] God, why
did the editor have to-

00:06:04.512 --> 00:06:05.814
- She still pisses me off,

00:06:05.914 --> 00:06:07.885
but at least I know
where I stand with her,

00:06:07.985 --> 00:06:11.058
which is kind of a nice change.

00:06:11.158 --> 00:06:13.128
The publisher I worked
for was on the first floor

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:15.601
of a building filled with
lots of other publishers,

00:06:15.701 --> 00:06:17.036
right in the middle of Tokyo.

00:06:17.136 --> 00:06:18.472
It was just a small company
producing

00:06:18.573 --> 00:06:22.080
entertainment magazines for
the 20-something market.

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:23.884
Since I was the same age as
their readers,

00:06:23.984 --> 00:06:25.419
I thought it would be
the perfect place for me,

00:06:25.521 --> 00:06:29.127
and I could make some sort
of creative contribution.

00:06:29.227 --> 00:06:31.866
But the only things they
let me do were cleaning,

00:06:31.966 --> 00:06:35.306
making the coffee, doing
photocopies,

00:06:35.406 --> 00:06:40.416
delivering manuscripts, and
all the unimportant stuff.

00:06:42.688 --> 00:06:43.222
It had nothing to do with

00:06:43.322 --> 00:06:45.493
the actual content of the
magazine.

00:06:45.594 --> 00:06:47.230
It was just menial labor.

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:51.071
But it was nonstop and really
hard work.

00:06:51.171 --> 00:06:53.777
Aw, my feet are killing me.

00:06:53.877 --> 00:06:56.916
I don't think I can stand
wearing heels tomorrow.

00:06:57.718 --> 00:06:58.720
(elevator bell rings)

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.893
(doors opening)

00:07:01.993 --> 00:07:03.262
Excuse me, sir.
- Yes?

00:07:03.362 --> 00:07:06.368
- I brought over the
graphics from Mr. Noguchi.

00:07:06.468 --> 00:07:09.775
- Oh, good work, Nana. How about
a drink after work tonight?

00:07:09.875 --> 00:07:11.111
- No thanks.

00:07:11.211 --> 00:07:13.482
The boss was totally lecherous.

00:07:13.583 --> 00:07:14.117
- Is there any way we can post-

00:07:14.217 --> 00:07:16.255
- [Nana] Most of the
employees were old suits.

00:07:16.355 --> 00:07:19.261
- Hey, Nana-bu, some more
coffee?

00:07:19.361 --> 00:07:21.365
- [Nana] Even the
younger guys were square.

00:07:21.465 --> 00:07:24.572
You could at least comb your
hair, Mr. Honda, 25 years old.

00:07:24.672 --> 00:07:26.876
- Miss Komatsu, don't you even
know

00:07:26.976 --> 00:07:28.580
how to use a photocopier?

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:30.049
They're all distorted.

00:07:30.149 --> 00:07:32.320
- I'm sorry. It won't happen
again.

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:33.022
(train rumbling)

00:07:33.122 --> 00:07:36.428
Rush hour trains suck. They're
so crowded.

00:07:36.529 --> 00:07:40.136
There's to look forward
to working at this job.

00:07:41.371 --> 00:07:42.373
I'm beat.

00:07:42.473 --> 00:07:45.413
(train rumbling)

00:07:50.924 --> 00:07:54.097
Why didn't they put an
elevator in this joint?

00:07:54.865 --> 00:07:58.607
Why?! It's seven stories.

00:07:58.707 --> 00:08:01.311
I guess that's why the rent's so
cheap.

00:08:02.948 --> 00:08:04.017
At least I'm home.

00:08:04.117 --> 00:08:05.621
(door opens)
(Nana yelps)

00:08:05.721 --> 00:08:06.556
- Hello, Hachiko!

00:08:06.656 --> 00:08:09.862
- Nana, what's going on?
Your smile's blinding me.

00:08:09.962 --> 00:08:12.066
- We've got a gig! We've got a
gig!

00:08:12.166 --> 00:08:14.070
There was an open slot
for a band on the bill

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:15.874
at the Shimokita, and we got it!

00:08:15.974 --> 00:08:17.611
- Huh?
- It's on May the 5th.

00:08:17.711 --> 00:08:19.347
We got a 30-minute slot.

00:08:19.447 --> 00:08:21.485
(Nana gasps)

00:08:21.586 --> 00:08:24.424
(both laughing)

00:08:25.761 --> 00:08:28.332
(Shinichi laughs)

00:08:28.432 --> 00:08:29.802
- Yay!

00:08:31.806 --> 00:08:35.146
- Wipe away those tears,
okay? We're celebrating.

00:08:36.716 --> 00:08:39.522
(gentle music)

00:08:43.462 --> 00:08:44.264
- Hey, did you hear?

00:08:44.364 --> 00:08:46.335
You know how May 5th is
Children's Day?

00:08:46.435 --> 00:08:48.138
Well, they're gonna make
these little carp flags

00:08:48.238 --> 00:08:50.811
to put on all the kids' meals.

00:08:50.911 --> 00:08:52.347
Look, Shoji, aren't they cute?

00:08:52.447 --> 00:08:54.852
- [Shoji] Wow. They're so
well-made.

00:08:54.952 --> 00:08:56.923
Cool.
(Sachiko chuckles)

00:08:57.023 --> 00:08:58.325
- You want one?

00:08:58.425 --> 00:08:59.662
- Sure. Thank you.

00:08:59.762 --> 00:09:01.031
- You can't have that one.

00:09:01.131 --> 00:09:04.304
The manager gave it to me as
a present for my birthday.

00:09:04.404 --> 00:09:04.605
- What was that?

00:09:04.705 --> 00:09:08.445
When was it your birthday,
and why didn't you tell me?

00:09:09.915 --> 00:09:10.784
- I haven't had it yet.

00:09:10.884 --> 00:09:12.420
My birthday's actually on
Children's Day.

00:09:12.521 --> 00:09:15.359
I don't work that day, so I
wouldn't get to see the flags.

00:09:15.459 --> 00:09:17.096
So the manager gave me one to
make up

00:09:17.196 --> 00:09:18.533
for the fact that I was gonna
miss out

00:09:18.633 --> 00:09:20.804
on all the fun at the restaurant
that day.

00:09:20.904 --> 00:09:22.006
- Oh, that's cool.

00:09:22.106 --> 00:09:24.177
You know, I get off work early
on the 5th.

00:09:24.277 --> 00:09:26.281
Why don't I take you
out for your birthday?

00:09:26.381 --> 00:09:27.383
- You'd do that?

00:09:28.285 --> 00:09:29.454
- Hmm.

00:09:29.555 --> 00:09:32.326
So what would you like,
a big birthday cake?

00:09:32.427 --> 00:09:33.930
- Yeah, I love cake.
(cellphone ringing)

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:35.967
- [Both] Huh?

00:09:36.068 --> 00:09:39.040
- Shoji, your phone.
- Yeah, sorry.

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:40.476
I forgot to turn it off.

00:09:40.577 --> 00:09:41.478
- Aren't you gonna answer it?

00:09:41.579 --> 00:09:42.413
- Nah, it's okay.

00:09:42.514 --> 00:09:43.917
- [Sachiko] It's your
girlfriend, isn't it?

00:09:44.017 --> 00:09:46.689
If you don't answer, it's
gonna seem suspicious.

00:09:46.789 --> 00:09:48.258
I'll just give you some privacy.

00:09:48.358 --> 00:09:49.929
- No, wait. You stay and I'll go
outside.

00:09:50.029 --> 00:09:53.068
(door closes)

00:09:53.168 --> 00:09:57.845
Ugh, what's my problem? I'm such
a jerk.

00:09:57.945 --> 00:09:59.147
(cellphone beeps)
Hey, Shoji here.

00:09:59.247 --> 00:10:00.382
- Hi, Shoji. You're still awake.

00:10:00.483 --> 00:10:01.986
You'll never guess what
happened.

00:10:02.086 --> 00:10:04.190
Nana's band just booked their
first gig!

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:05.961
- Oh. That sounds really great.

00:10:06.061 --> 00:10:07.130
I'm happy for them.

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:09.401
- [Nana] The concerts on
May the 5th at 8:00 p. m.

00:10:09.502 --> 00:10:10.369
Can you make it?
- Hmm?

00:10:10.469 --> 00:10:12.775
Aw, man.

00:10:12.875 --> 00:10:16.816
Sorry, the 5th is kind of, uh...

00:10:16.916 --> 00:10:18.620
- What? You can't go?

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:19.755
You got to work?

00:10:19.855 --> 00:10:21.859
- Yeah.
- Oh, that sucks.

00:10:21.959 --> 00:10:23.530
Can't you get out of it somehow?

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:24.431
- [Shoji] Not really.

00:10:24.532 --> 00:10:27.203
It gets so busy on the
holiday, I just can't.

00:10:27.303 --> 00:10:30.409
I'm sorry. Maybe next time.

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:32.180
- Okay.

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:37.323
(cellphone beeps)
(wind blowing)

00:10:37.423 --> 00:10:38.593
(door opens)

00:10:38.693 --> 00:10:40.296
- [Sachiko] Huh?

00:10:42.433 --> 00:10:43.970
- [Shoji] Let's spend
Children's Day together.

00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:45.339
We'll go throw some beans
around.

00:10:45.439 --> 00:10:49.314
- [Sachiko] You do that for
Setsubun, not Children's Day.

00:10:51.051 --> 00:10:54.525
(gentle piano music)

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:58.499
(birds chirping)

00:10:59.467 --> 00:11:00.871
- All right, what's with the
staring?

00:11:00.971 --> 00:11:03.175
It's really bothering me.

00:11:03.275 --> 00:11:05.312
- Well, I thought I saw
this really hot woman,

00:11:05.412 --> 00:11:06.649
then I realized it was you.

00:11:06.749 --> 00:11:09.154
- [Junko] Huh? Are you
trying to seduce me?

00:11:09.254 --> 00:11:10.022
'Cause it won't work.

00:11:10.122 --> 00:11:12.193
- [Kyosuke] I'm not trying
anything.

00:11:12.293 --> 00:11:13.997
I just want to be with you.

00:11:14.097 --> 00:11:16.134
- What's gotten into you? Are
you sick?

00:11:16.234 --> 00:11:17.436
Did you eat those eggs in the
fridge?

00:11:17.538 --> 00:11:19.407
They're way past their sell-by
date.

00:11:19.508 --> 00:11:20.409
- No, I didn't.

00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:22.748
I was thinking about
how people get restless

00:11:22.848 --> 00:11:23.817
in their relationships.

00:11:23.917 --> 00:11:27.558
And then I just felt like
I really had to see you.

00:11:27.658 --> 00:11:28.760
- Yes?

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:29.494
- I was chatting with Shoji

00:11:29.595 --> 00:11:31.398
and he mentioned Tamaru's
sister.

00:11:31.498 --> 00:11:34.003
I'd completely forgotten about
her till Shoji reminded me.

00:11:34.103 --> 00:11:35.306
- Tamaru from school?

00:11:35.406 --> 00:11:37.143
- Yeah, well, I dated her for a
while,

00:11:37.243 --> 00:11:38.278
and I was totally in love with
her.

00:11:38.378 --> 00:11:40.482
But when I found out
she'd been cheating on me,

00:11:40.584 --> 00:11:41.953
I was really hurt.

00:11:43.121 --> 00:11:44.057
- Jeez, what's gotten into you?

00:11:44.157 --> 00:11:47.263
Lamenting your bittersweet
youth, kinda sad.

00:11:47.363 --> 00:11:50.035
- [Kyosuke] You know, I
don't think there's anything

00:11:50.135 --> 00:11:51.839
we can do to fix what Shoji's
done.

00:11:51.939 --> 00:11:55.179
- What? Don't tell me he's
actually slept with Sachiko.

00:11:55.279 --> 00:11:57.283
- Well, for as long as I've
known him,

00:11:57.383 --> 00:12:00.022
he's never been the kinda
guy to cheat on a girlfriend,

00:12:00.122 --> 00:12:01.526
not even to think about it.

00:12:01.626 --> 00:12:04.464
- No, that's impossible.
He couldn't do it.

00:12:06.167 --> 00:12:06.669
- I know.

00:12:06.769 --> 00:12:09.374
That's what makes me wonder
if this is the real thing.

00:12:09.474 --> 00:12:11.546
He might have fallen so
much in love with Sachiko,

00:12:11.646 --> 00:12:14.585
he's willing to risk
everything he has with Nana.

00:12:14.685 --> 00:12:17.089
If so, there's nothing
we can do.

00:12:17.691 --> 00:12:18.560
(Junko gasps)

00:12:21.599 --> 00:12:24.437
(wind blowing)

00:12:26.141 --> 00:12:29.180
(somber music)

00:12:35.927 --> 00:12:37.698
- So what's he gonna do about
Nana?

00:12:37.798 --> 00:12:38.600
- I'm not really sure.

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:40.336
I mean, it's not like
something's happened

00:12:40.436 --> 00:12:41.572
that would make him stop liking
her.

00:12:41.672 --> 00:12:43.275
No matter what he says about
her,

00:12:43.375 --> 00:12:45.680
I know he still cares for her a
lot.

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:46.816
- But he's got to do something.

00:12:46.916 --> 00:12:47.618
If he carries on like this,

00:12:47.718 --> 00:12:50.122
both Nana and Sachiko are gonna
get hurt.

00:12:50.222 --> 00:12:53.863
- Yeah, but that's easy for
us to say.

00:12:53.963 --> 00:12:55.232
I don't know much about Sachiko,

00:12:55.332 --> 00:12:58.338
but I worry how Nana would
cope if she found out.

00:12:58.438 --> 00:13:00.209
Maybe she doesn't need
to know what's going on

00:13:00.309 --> 00:13:02.313
between Shoji and Sachiko.

00:13:02.413 --> 00:13:03.683
This may just be a quick fling

00:13:03.783 --> 00:13:06.087
and everything will go
back to how it was before.

00:13:06.187 --> 00:13:08.392
- In my experience, it
never happens like that.

00:13:08.492 --> 00:13:10.129
- But just think about it for
a sec.

00:13:10.229 --> 00:13:16.308
Can you imagine, Nana suddenly
getting dumped by Shoji?

00:13:16.408 --> 00:13:20.517
It's a scary prospect.
She'd totally freak out.

00:13:20.617 --> 00:13:22.453
(thunder crackles)
- Shoji's covering his tracks

00:13:22.554 --> 00:13:23.823
so Nana won't find out, right?!

00:13:23.923 --> 00:13:24.625
- Who knows?

00:13:24.725 --> 00:13:28.198
All I can say is that this is
really gonna suck, big time.

00:13:28.298 --> 00:13:31.404
(Junko whimpers)

00:13:32.406 --> 00:13:34.979
(cellphone buzzing)

00:13:35.079 --> 00:13:36.181
(cellphone beeps)

00:13:36.281 --> 00:13:37.951
- Hello? This is Nana.

00:13:38.051 --> 00:13:39.387
Hi, Jun. How are you?

00:13:39.487 --> 00:13:41.826
It's been a while. What's up?

00:13:41.926 --> 00:13:43.228
(Junko sighs)

00:13:43.328 --> 00:13:45.867
- So, Nana, it sounds
like you're still at work.

00:13:45.967 --> 00:13:47.003
Is it all right to talk?

00:13:47.103 --> 00:13:47.771
- Oh, yeah, it's fine.

00:13:47.871 --> 00:13:50.376
We made our deadline, so things
have calmed down a bit here.

00:13:50.476 --> 00:13:53.048
- [Junko] Anyway, I got
your text about that concert

00:13:53.148 --> 00:13:54.350
your roommate's doing soon.

00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:56.622
- Yeah, it's gonna be
happening this Saturday night.

00:13:56.722 --> 00:13:57.524
Can you come?
- Yeah.

00:13:57.624 --> 00:14:00.630
I think Kyosuke will come
too. How do we get there?

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:02.968
- Why don't the three of us go
together?

00:14:03.068 --> 00:14:04.304
- Oh. Just the three of us?

00:14:04.404 --> 00:14:05.607
What about Shoji?

00:14:05.707 --> 00:14:08.045
- [Nana] He can't make
it. He's got to work.

00:14:08.145 --> 00:14:09.180
- Really?

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:10.950
- [Nana] Jun, about Shoji, don't
you think

00:14:11.051 --> 00:14:13.856
he's been acting kind of weird
lately?

00:14:13.956 --> 00:14:14.958
- [Junko] Like how?!

00:14:15.059 --> 00:14:15.492
- [Nana] It's just a feeling.

00:14:15.593 --> 00:14:18.165
- Oh, I don't know. I
haven't noticed anything.

00:14:18.265 --> 00:14:21.271
- [Nana] It's kinda like
he's been avoiding me.

00:14:21.371 --> 00:14:23.543
- [Junko] You're imagining
it. He's just busy.

00:14:23.643 --> 00:14:26.414
- [Nana] But what if he's
starting to get sick of me?

00:14:26.515 --> 00:14:28.553
- [Junko] Don't forget, you've
been pretty busy yourself,

00:14:28.653 --> 00:14:29.922
what, with your job and
everything.

00:14:30.022 --> 00:14:32.326
Maybe you need to make
some time to meet with him.

00:14:32.426 --> 00:14:33.629
Show him you really care,

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:35.533
and I'm sure it'll change
his feelings for...

00:14:35.633 --> 00:14:38.005
I mean, his attitude towards
you.

00:14:38.105 --> 00:14:38.773
- Yeah, you're right.

00:14:38.873 --> 00:14:40.543
I haven't given him a
lot of attention lately.

00:14:40.643 --> 00:14:42.380
I can easily change that.

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:44.651
Thanks, Jun. I'll give
you a call soon, okay?

00:14:44.752 --> 00:14:45.052
(cellphone beeps)

00:14:45.152 --> 00:14:47.724
Ms. Sakagami, what are you
doing wasting time out here?

00:14:47.824 --> 00:14:49.394
Don't you have a lot
of work to do?

00:14:49.494 --> 00:14:51.699
(Ms. Sakagami groans)

00:14:51.799 --> 00:14:53.936
- Hmm. What am I doing?

00:14:54.037 --> 00:14:56.341
I can't believe I'm
actually covering for Shoji.

00:14:56.441 --> 00:14:58.478
That's just really screwed up,

00:14:58.579 --> 00:15:01.317
but I don't know what else
to do.

00:15:01.418 --> 00:15:03.823
- Thanks. Hope to see you
again soon.

00:15:06.629 --> 00:15:07.329
(Shoji gasps)

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:09.868
- Hi, Shoji. Surprise!

00:15:09.968 --> 00:15:13.075
Sorry for just showing up like
this. I hope you don't mind.

00:15:13.175 --> 00:15:14.210
- Hey there, my name's Shin.

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:15.814
I'm the new bass player in the
band.

00:15:15.914 --> 00:15:16.716
- Oh, hi.

00:15:16.816 --> 00:15:20.890
- Hachi insisted on dragging
us all down here to see you.

00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:22.828
So you better hook us up.

00:15:22.928 --> 00:15:23.663
- Oh, right, yeah.

00:15:23.763 --> 00:15:25.600
I'll see what we've got
available. Hold on a sec.

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:27.336
(Nana 1 chuckles)
- Thank you.

00:15:27.436 --> 00:15:29.240
(Shoji whimpers)

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:30.209
- Come right this way.

00:15:30.309 --> 00:15:32.581
- Uh, no. I want to sit near the
window.

00:15:32.681 --> 00:15:34.651
- Who cares where we sit?

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:37.858
- [Sachiko] I'll be right with
you.

00:15:38.693 --> 00:15:39.293
- Wait a second.

00:15:39.394 --> 00:15:42.466
Where did Shoji go?
(Sachiko gasps)

00:15:42.567 --> 00:15:44.705
- He probably just went
to get us some water.

00:15:44.805 --> 00:15:46.976
Come on, sit down. He'll be back
soon.

00:15:47.076 --> 00:15:49.213
- [Shinichi] Your boyfriend's
pretty cool, Nana.

00:15:49.313 --> 00:15:50.950
He's a man in uniform.

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:53.288
- Yeah, he looks good, but
wait till he opens his mouth.

00:15:53.388 --> 00:15:54.457
(ice cubs rattling)
(Nana and Shinichi laughing)

00:15:54.558 --> 00:15:55.827
- [Nana] You always say that.

00:15:55.927 --> 00:15:57.029
(Nana laughs)

00:15:57.129 --> 00:15:59.033
(glass breaks)

00:15:59.133 --> 00:16:00.637
- Miss Kawamura, what are you
doing?

00:16:00.737 --> 00:16:02.941
- [Sachiko] I'm sorry. I'm so
clumsy.

00:16:03.041 --> 00:16:05.245
- [Employee] Wait, don't
pick it up with your hands.

00:16:05.345 --> 00:16:07.049
I'll go get a broom.

00:16:07.149 --> 00:16:09.855
- [Sachiko] Oh.

00:16:09.955 --> 00:16:10.890
(footsteps treading)

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:12.894
- You cut yourself. You okay?

00:16:15.733 --> 00:16:18.405
- But this is your
handkerchief. I'm really sorry.

00:16:18.506 --> 00:16:19.508
- [Nana] Oh, don't worry about
it.

00:16:19.608 --> 00:16:21.077
I'll let you keep it anyway.

00:16:21.177 --> 00:16:22.446
- But I-
- We have to stop

00:16:22.547 --> 00:16:25.352
that cut from bleeding, so it's
okay.

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:30.095
- I'm sorry.

00:16:30.195 --> 00:16:31.030
- Huh?

00:16:31.131 --> 00:16:31.899
- [Employee] Why are you crying?

00:16:31.999 --> 00:16:35.139
It's just a broken glass. Come
on, get up.

00:16:35.239 --> 00:16:38.579
You go out back. I'll clean up
for you.

00:16:38.679 --> 00:16:41.484
Sorry for all the trouble.
Thanks for helping.

00:16:41.585 --> 00:16:43.288
- No, no, no. That's fine.

00:16:43.388 --> 00:16:44.858
Don't worry about it.

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:48.031
- That was nice of you
to go and help, Hachi.

00:16:48.131 --> 00:16:49.167
You just went way up in my book.

00:16:49.267 --> 00:16:51.137
- Yeah, I used to work at
a family restaurant before,

00:16:51.237 --> 00:16:53.175
so I know what it feels like
to do something like that.

00:16:53.275 --> 00:16:56.447
It's as if I'm experiencing
it all over again myself.

00:16:56.549 --> 00:16:58.451
- Yeah, but I bet you made
mistakes

00:16:58.553 --> 00:16:59.988
that were much worse than that.

00:17:00.088 --> 00:17:01.725
- Huh? What are saying?

00:17:01.826 --> 00:17:04.631
(all laughing)

00:17:06.569 --> 00:17:09.140
- I just ran away. Again.

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:11.512
How's hiding in here gonna help?

00:17:11.612 --> 00:17:13.683
It's not like I haven't
thought about this happening.

00:17:13.783 --> 00:17:15.787
Nana might not realize who
Sachiko is,

00:17:15.887 --> 00:17:18.191
but Sachiko's probably figured
it out.

00:17:18.291 --> 00:17:20.429
Nana can be so obvious.

00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:24.237
Please let Nana be nice
and quiet for once.

00:17:24.337 --> 00:17:26.007
(Shoji whimpers)

00:17:26.107 --> 00:17:28.646
(Shoji sighs)

00:17:28.746 --> 00:17:32.721
I am such a loser. Make myself
sick.

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:37.429
(door opens)

00:17:37.531 --> 00:17:38.833
(Sachiko whimpers)
Huh?

00:17:38.933 --> 00:17:41.872
(door opens)

00:17:41.972 --> 00:17:45.078
(door closes)

00:17:45.178 --> 00:17:48.886
(door opens)
(Sachiko crying)

00:17:48.986 --> 00:17:51.825
(gentle music)

00:17:53.729 --> 00:17:54.698
Sachiko?

00:17:54.798 --> 00:17:55.833
- Huh?

00:18:01.211 --> 00:18:05.553
Shoji, let's stop this.
She's so sweet and so kind.

00:18:05.653 --> 00:18:07.591
She seems like such a great
person.

00:18:07.691 --> 00:18:09.493
- [Shoji] What happened between
you two?

00:18:09.595 --> 00:18:12.901
- Nothing. I don't even
think she knows who I am.

00:18:13.001 --> 00:18:15.940
(Sachiko grunts)

00:18:17.644 --> 00:18:20.717
We have to stop before someone
gets hurt.

00:18:23.556 --> 00:18:25.492
I'm sorry, Shoji.

00:18:25.593 --> 00:18:27.931
If I hadn't been so
determined to win you over,

00:18:28.031 --> 00:18:30.637
none of this would've ever
happened.

00:18:32.306 --> 00:18:34.778
- It isn't your fault.

00:18:34.878 --> 00:18:36.447
- [Sachiko] If we keep seeing
each other,

00:18:36.548 --> 00:18:39.053
things are gonna get
totally messed up for you.

00:18:39.153 --> 00:18:40.556
- No, that isn't true.

00:18:40.657 --> 00:18:44.430
- The thing is, it's gonna
get harder for me too.

00:18:49.206 --> 00:18:52.580
No one can be happy in
a situation like this.

00:18:53.883 --> 00:18:57.423
Listen to me, Shoji. Take
care of your girlfriend.

00:19:04.571 --> 00:19:07.777
(door creaks)

00:19:07.877 --> 00:19:09.480
(door closes)

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:14.658
(Shinichi sighs)

00:19:14.758 --> 00:19:15.793
- You know, I never realized

00:19:15.893 --> 00:19:18.599
how difficult eating would
be with a pierced lip.

00:19:18.699 --> 00:19:20.335
- Oh, you poor a little baby.

00:19:20.435 --> 00:19:21.404
- I don't understand it, Shin.

00:19:21.505 --> 00:19:22.774
It seems like every time we see
you,

00:19:22.874 --> 00:19:24.578
you have another part
of your body pierced.

00:19:24.678 --> 00:19:26.347
And now, you've got one on your
lip?

00:19:26.447 --> 00:19:28.151
Your face was so pretty before.

00:19:28.251 --> 00:19:30.455
And won't it be hard to
kiss with that thing on?

00:19:30.556 --> 00:19:32.861
- No, I have had any problems so
far.

00:19:32.961 --> 00:19:34.798
(both gasping)

00:19:34.898 --> 00:19:36.969
- Shin, who the hell have
you been kissing? Nobuo?

00:19:37.069 --> 00:19:38.739
- What? I never knew Nobuo was
into

00:19:38.839 --> 00:19:40.877
that kinda stuff.
- Is he?

00:19:40.977 --> 00:19:43.048
- No, but I thought it
was entirely possible

00:19:43.148 --> 00:19:43.683
he might have been.

00:19:43.783 --> 00:19:45.953
- Sorry to disappoint
you, but I'm straight.

00:19:46.054 --> 00:19:48.024
- So, Shin, are you gonna be
crashing

00:19:48.124 --> 00:19:48.759
permanently at Nobuo's?

00:19:48.859 --> 00:19:50.863
You know, like become his
roommate?

00:19:50.963 --> 00:19:53.068
- Actually, recently,
I haven't been staying

00:19:53.168 --> 00:19:53.769
at his place too often.

00:19:53.869 --> 00:19:55.506
I didn't want to get
in his way being there

00:19:55.606 --> 00:19:56.642
all the time, you know?

00:19:56.742 --> 00:19:59.013
- I see. So you've been going
home, then?

00:19:59.113 --> 00:19:59.748
- [Shinichi] No.

00:19:59.848 --> 00:20:01.552
- Well, then where have you been
staying?

00:20:01.652 --> 00:20:03.121
- With all sorts of women.

00:20:03.221 --> 00:20:04.223
(both gasping)

00:20:04.323 --> 00:20:05.392
A night here, a night there.

00:20:05.492 --> 00:20:08.031
(both gasping)

00:20:08.131 --> 00:20:08.933
I need to be realistic.

00:20:09.033 --> 00:20:11.772
Who's gonna give a punk like
me a decent job? No one, right?

00:20:11.872 --> 00:20:13.441
So I figure if I can get by
doing this,

00:20:13.542 --> 00:20:17.817
I won't have to worry about
earning money at a real job.

00:20:17.917 --> 00:20:20.122
It's a pretty easy life
when it all works out.

00:20:20.222 --> 00:20:22.126
(both gasping)

00:20:22.226 --> 00:20:26.167
- [Nana 2] Shin, you're a total
scammer!

00:20:26.267 --> 00:20:27.236
- Why am I a total scammer?

00:20:27.336 --> 00:20:30.008
- Going into strange women's
homes, you might get killed.

00:20:30.108 --> 00:20:32.514
- Oh, Shin, you're breaking my
heart.

00:20:32.614 --> 00:20:34.050
- Nana?
- Huh?

00:20:35.018 --> 00:20:36.054
Huh?

00:20:38.291 --> 00:20:40.563
Hey, Shoji, where have you been?
We've been waiting for you.

00:20:40.663 --> 00:20:43.268
- Nana, have you got any plans
for later?

00:20:43.368 --> 00:20:44.437
- No, not yet.

00:20:44.538 --> 00:20:45.740
I've got the next four days off
work,

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:48.144
so I can just hang around
here till you're done.

00:20:48.244 --> 00:20:51.017
- It's better if you
don't wait here, okay?

00:20:53.889 --> 00:20:58.699
Can I meet you at your place
later? I think we need to talk.

00:21:00.402 --> 00:21:05.813
- [Nana 1] That night, if
Nana hadn't been there for me,

00:21:05.913 --> 00:21:09.621
I think I would've thrown
myself into the Tama River.

00:21:10.656 --> 00:21:12.594
I'm sure of that.
