WEBVTT

00:00:00.869 --> 00:00:02.371
(harp music)

00:00:03.108 --> 00:00:04.144
- [Hachi] The next time I fall
in love

00:00:04.244 --> 00:00:07.918
I wouldn't mind being with
someone who's a little harsh.

00:00:08.018 --> 00:00:11.391
He doesn't have to do every
little thing I want him to.

00:00:12.493 --> 00:00:14.532
But after we get in an argument

00:00:14.632 --> 00:00:16.301
I like him to give me a flower

00:00:16.401 --> 00:00:18.138
and tell me he loves me.

00:00:19.007 --> 00:00:21.979
That's the kind of guy I want.

00:00:23.516 --> 00:00:26.254
(rock music)

00:02:02.648 --> 00:02:05.787
(tranquil music)

00:02:14.905 --> 00:02:18.011
(chimes ringing)

00:02:20.583 --> 00:02:23.188
- I'm too excited to sleep.

00:02:27.463 --> 00:02:31.304
It feels like the Trapnest
concert happened a long time
ago.

00:02:31.973 --> 00:02:35.112
(crowd cheering)

00:02:36.716 --> 00:02:37.483
(gasping)

00:02:37.584 --> 00:02:43.061
Damn, I was so fixated on Ren
I forgot to look at Takumi.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.332
Takumi.

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.910
Oh, well.

00:02:51.011 --> 00:02:53.415
What's done is done.

00:02:53.516 --> 00:02:56.254
Nana left over two hours ago.

00:02:56.354 --> 00:02:58.158
But knowing her-

00:02:58.258 --> 00:03:01.197
- One day Blast is going
to be bigger than Trapnest.

00:03:01.297 --> 00:03:01.866
- Oh, yeah.

00:03:01.966 --> 00:03:04.103
Like that will ever happen.

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:08.011
- Hopefully she didn't go
over just to yell at Ren

00:03:08.111 --> 00:03:10.984
and then turn around and
come right back here.

00:03:12.688 --> 00:03:15.259
Did things turn out okay?

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:16.796
I sure hope so.

00:03:16.896 --> 00:03:19.434
(chimes ringing)

00:03:19.535 --> 00:03:20.436
We're women, Nana.

00:03:20.537 --> 00:03:21.037
And there's no reason

00:03:21.137 --> 00:03:24.010
we shouldn't allow
ourselves some pleasures.

00:03:37.436 --> 00:03:38.773
- Huh.

00:03:38.873 --> 00:03:40.109
Nana!

00:03:44.685 --> 00:03:49.795
- [Nana] I didn't come here
to get back together with you.

00:03:49.895 --> 00:03:52.567
(Ren sighs)

00:03:56.374 --> 00:03:59.347
(water running)

00:03:59.447 --> 00:04:00.449
(petal snaps)

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.923
(lighter clicking)

00:04:10.235 --> 00:04:10.870
- Huh?

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.239
(water splashing)

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:14.678
(tranquil music)

00:04:14.778 --> 00:04:18.085
(water splashing)

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.165
- Mm.

00:04:27.136 --> 00:04:28.806
(water splashing)

00:04:28.906 --> 00:04:29.675
- [Ren] Huh.

00:04:29.775 --> 00:04:30.375
So, what is all this anyway?

00:04:30.476 --> 00:04:32.948
Don't you know how
expensive these roses are?

00:04:33.048 --> 00:04:34.117
- [Nana] You're a big rockstar.

00:04:34.217 --> 00:04:36.488
What do you care about a few
flowers?

00:04:36.589 --> 00:04:38.860
Besides, flowers aren't
meant to last, anyway.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.730
So, I might as well make use of
them

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.534
before they wither away and die.

00:04:42.634 --> 00:04:45.205
- That's a depressing
metaphor I could do without.

00:04:45.305 --> 00:04:47.944
- But you'll never wither away,
Ren.

00:04:53.121 --> 00:04:54.423
- I can't believe this hotel
room.

00:04:54.525 --> 00:04:55.159
It's amazing.

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:56.729
And you have it all to yourself?

00:04:56.829 --> 00:04:57.964
The place is huge.

00:04:58.064 --> 00:04:59.601
It has to be one of the suites.

00:04:59.701 --> 00:05:00.837
- It's much better than that.

00:05:00.937 --> 00:05:02.874
This is one of their deluxe
suits.

00:05:02.974 --> 00:05:03.743
(Nana laughs)

00:05:03.843 --> 00:05:04.343
- It's insane.

00:05:04.444 --> 00:05:06.649
I've never seen such an enormous
tub.

00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:08.018
- The rooms way too big.

00:05:08.118 --> 00:05:10.523
I don't feel comfortable staying
here.

00:05:11.859 --> 00:05:13.261
- Sitting here like this with
you,

00:05:13.361 --> 00:05:14.865
it's like a weird trip back in
time.

00:05:14.965 --> 00:05:16.969
Remember how you and I used to
have a bath

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:18.038
with each other everyday?

00:05:18.138 --> 00:05:20.777
Talking about anything and
everything.

00:05:20.877 --> 00:05:23.248
Of course, the tub in our
place was pretty small,

00:05:23.348 --> 00:05:26.187
but I was so comfortable in it
with you.

00:05:26.287 --> 00:05:28.960
So, Ren, about our old place.

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.097
Since no one's living there,
it's a waste.

00:05:31.197 --> 00:05:32.701
Shouldn't you just let it go?

00:05:32.801 --> 00:05:33.870
- Don't worry, it's okay.

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.374
I'm hanging onto it 'cause
that's where I got my start

00:05:36.474 --> 00:05:38.646
and someday I'm gonna buy the
place.

00:05:38.746 --> 00:05:41.952
Then we can retire there
and grow old together.

00:05:42.052 --> 00:05:42.521
(water splashing)

00:05:42.621 --> 00:05:45.793
- Don't you tell me what
I'm gonna do when I retire.

00:05:45.894 --> 00:05:46.427
- When I was a kid,

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:48.933
the building was just an empty
warehouse.

00:05:49.033 --> 00:05:49.902
I used to sneak in there

00:05:50.002 --> 00:05:52.841
whenever I ran away from
that damn orphanage.

00:05:52.941 --> 00:05:54.143
I found a guitar.

00:05:54.243 --> 00:05:55.179
Put new strings on it

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:59.320
and I would sit there
playing it all night long.

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:00.055
Huh.

00:06:00.155 --> 00:06:01.992
It doesn't matter if you're born

00:06:02.092 --> 00:06:02.594
with natural talent or not.

00:06:02.694 --> 00:06:05.365
When you practice that
much, you're gonna get good.

00:06:05.465 --> 00:06:08.806
- This is the first time
you've told me that story.

00:06:08.906 --> 00:06:11.044
- Well, I never told anyone.

00:06:11.812 --> 00:06:14.217
Never let them see you sweat.

00:06:14.317 --> 00:06:17.624
(water trickling)

00:06:19.928 --> 00:06:22.834
(Nana grunting)

00:06:22.934 --> 00:06:23.603
- You don't have to wash me.

00:06:23.703 --> 00:06:26.775
I took a bath before,
so I'm already clean.

00:06:26.876 --> 00:06:29.113
- Sorry, old habits die hard.

00:06:29.213 --> 00:06:30.717
But how come you're so
embarrassed?

00:06:30.817 --> 00:06:31.886
- Who said I was embarrassed?

00:06:31.986 --> 00:06:33.154
I'm just not on the pill
anymore.

00:06:33.255 --> 00:06:34.323
So, there's no way the two of us

00:06:34.423 --> 00:06:35.627
are gonna do it in the bath.

00:06:35.727 --> 00:06:36.327
Okay?

00:06:36.427 --> 00:06:37.296
- All right, all right, I know.

00:06:37.396 --> 00:06:39.166
- Yeah, do you really?

00:06:39.267 --> 00:06:42.541
(water splashing)

00:06:50.523 --> 00:06:51.391
Ren?

00:06:51.491 --> 00:06:52.092
- [Ren] Hm?

00:06:52.192 --> 00:06:54.831
- [Nana] Did you really
mean what you just said?

00:06:54.932 --> 00:06:56.769
- What part are you talking
about?

00:06:56.869 --> 00:06:58.004
- I've got my pride you know?

00:06:58.104 --> 00:06:59.608
And I've got my own career ahead
of me.

00:06:59.708 --> 00:07:02.747
I can't live with you
like we did before.

00:07:02.847 --> 00:07:05.620
I just, it wouldn't work.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:09.226
But, I'd be into us
getting together like this

00:07:09.327 --> 00:07:11.097
from time to time.

00:07:11.197 --> 00:07:12.433
Being with each other,

00:07:12.534 --> 00:07:16.742
holding each other,
talking to each other.

00:07:16.842 --> 00:07:19.447
And someday, when I'm older,

00:07:19.548 --> 00:07:23.421
and my pride and
vanity faded away.

00:07:23.522 --> 00:07:25.425
And I get tired of singing.

00:07:25.526 --> 00:07:29.267
Then can I go back there
and retire with you?

00:07:31.104 --> 00:07:34.410
(water splashing)

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:36.281
(wind blowing)

00:07:36.381 --> 00:07:38.218
- [Hachi] That night I dreamt a
lot.

00:07:38.318 --> 00:07:40.455
I can't remember
what the dreams were about.

00:07:40.556 --> 00:07:45.700
But when I woke up, I had this
warm happy feeling inside.

00:07:47.604 --> 00:07:49.273
(birds chirping)

00:07:49.373 --> 00:07:52.179
I didn't wake up until it was
afternoon.

00:07:52.279 --> 00:07:55.385
And I saw that Nana was
still asleep by my side.

00:07:58.158 --> 00:07:58.926
(toothbrush scrubbing)

00:07:59.026 --> 00:08:00.495
I wonder if I should ask her.

00:08:00.596 --> 00:08:03.068
It is okay to ask, isn't it?

00:08:03.168 --> 00:08:05.940
She said she'd tell me anything,
right?

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.443
I gotta ask, Nana!

00:08:07.544 --> 00:08:09.881
How did it go with Ren last
night?

00:08:11.518 --> 00:08:14.056
- I can't tell you anything
when I'm brushing my teeth.

00:08:14.156 --> 00:08:14.992
- What'd you say?

00:08:15.092 --> 00:08:16.194
I didn't understand!

00:08:16.294 --> 00:08:18.431
(Nana gurgling)

00:08:18.532 --> 00:08:20.068
- What I said was, I
can't tell you anything

00:08:20.168 --> 00:08:23.208
'cause I'm the middle
of brushing my teeth.

00:08:23.308 --> 00:08:24.043
(upbeat music)

00:08:24.143 --> 00:08:25.012
You're not very good
at figuring things out,

00:08:25.112 --> 00:08:26.080
are you, Hachi?

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:26.949
Oh, well.

00:08:27.049 --> 00:08:29.688
What can you expect from a puppy
dog?

00:08:29.788 --> 00:08:31.357
- [Hachi] But, Nana.

00:08:31.457 --> 00:08:32.226
- All right, then.

00:08:32.326 --> 00:08:32.827
Let's eat.

00:08:32.927 --> 00:08:34.998
- [Mom] There's more soup
if you want it, okay?

00:08:35.098 --> 00:08:35.700
- Thank you.

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:38.539
- You never answered my
question, Nana.

00:08:38.639 --> 00:08:40.208
Big liar.

00:08:40.308 --> 00:08:41.077
I can't believe I was so freaked
out

00:08:41.177 --> 00:08:44.483
about you and Ren that I
forget to look at Takumi.

00:08:44.584 --> 00:08:47.757
Now it's obvious, I should
have just watched him.

00:08:47.857 --> 00:08:48.559
(Hachi sighing)

00:08:48.659 --> 00:08:49.528
Hm, Takumi.

00:08:49.628 --> 00:08:51.799
- Okay, you know what, Hachiko?

00:08:51.899 --> 00:08:53.001
I can trust you, right?

00:08:53.101 --> 00:08:54.938
'Cause I got a favor to ask you.

00:08:55.038 --> 00:08:55.773
(chimes ringing)

00:08:55.873 --> 00:08:56.608
- She trusts me?

00:08:56.709 --> 00:08:57.276
Sure you can.

00:08:57.376 --> 00:08:58.846
What do you want?

00:08:58.946 --> 00:08:59.781
- Hm, mm.

00:08:59.881 --> 00:09:01.852
If you can do this without
screwing up,

00:09:01.952 --> 00:09:02.520
I'll give you a treat.

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:05.292
I'm mean, you really came
through for me yesterday.

00:09:05.392 --> 00:09:06.160
What would you like?

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.164
A dog bone or something like
that?

00:09:08.264 --> 00:09:08.999
(tail swishing)

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:09.801
- Takumi's autograph?

00:09:09.901 --> 00:09:10.970
- [Nana] Okay, no problem

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:11.538
(Hachi gasping)

00:09:11.638 --> 00:09:13.909
I'll just ask Ren to get
one for you.

00:09:15.646 --> 00:09:16.180
- Yay!

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:17.550
(laser chirps)

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:17.851
(upbeat music)

00:09:17.951 --> 00:09:19.019
- You're getting this
excited over an autograph?

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.288
- No, it's not that.

00:09:20.389 --> 00:09:21.992
It's 'cause you and Ren
are back together again.

00:09:22.092 --> 00:09:25.867
- Uh, we're not exactly
back together.

00:09:25.967 --> 00:09:26.367
Anyway.

00:09:26.467 --> 00:09:28.539
You know how we don't
have a phone at our place?

00:09:28.639 --> 00:09:30.910
And, although I'm gonna
buy a cell phone soon,

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:31.912
what I wanted to ask was,

00:09:32.012 --> 00:09:34.316
would you mind if Ren calls
me on yours until then?

00:09:34.417 --> 00:09:34.851
Is that okay?

00:09:34.951 --> 00:09:36.588
- So, go I can be like your
go-between

00:09:36.688 --> 00:09:39.060
and pass messages on and stuff
like that?

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.563
- Yeah, I guess that's right.

00:09:40.663 --> 00:09:41.230
- Of course.

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:41.865
I'll totally do it.

00:09:41.965 --> 00:09:44.303
- Here, I got his email
address in case you need it.

00:09:44.403 --> 00:09:47.109
And if you don't mind, can
you send him yours too?

00:09:47.209 --> 00:09:48.579
- This is such great news, Nana.

00:09:48.679 --> 00:09:49.213
- No, it's not.

00:09:49.313 --> 00:09:50.516
- But why not?

00:09:50.616 --> 00:09:53.421
- I don't know how I got
myself into this mess.

00:09:53.522 --> 00:09:56.227
I didn't plan for it to be like
this.

00:09:56.327 --> 00:09:57.831
I wanted some closure.

00:09:57.931 --> 00:10:00.536
But instead of putting an
end to things between us

00:10:00.636 --> 00:10:03.943
I allowed myself to get
sucked in by him again.

00:10:04.443 --> 00:10:06.047
This blows.

00:10:06.147 --> 00:10:06.515
(chimes ringing)

00:10:06.615 --> 00:10:08.051
- [Hachi] Watching Nana all
curled up

00:10:08.151 --> 00:10:10.355
on the floor in front of me.

00:10:10.455 --> 00:10:12.994
I've never seen her look
so cute.

00:10:13.094 --> 00:10:14.998
(chimes ringing)

00:10:15.098 --> 00:10:16.367
(Hachi sighs)

00:10:16.467 --> 00:10:18.238
- [Hachi] Huh, whoa.

00:10:18.338 --> 00:10:19.741
I'm on a mission!

00:10:19.841 --> 00:10:20.610
(chimes ringing)

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:21.177
(laser whirring)

00:10:21.277 --> 00:10:22.914
- I want happiness and I want it
now.

00:10:23.014 --> 00:10:24.316
I mean, I want a boyfriend.

00:10:24.416 --> 00:10:25.787
- Why don't we organize a party
for you?

00:10:25.887 --> 00:10:28.057
- No, I don't think that will do
any good.

00:10:28.158 --> 00:10:28.893
(chimes ringing)

00:10:28.993 --> 00:10:29.561
This time when I fall in love,

00:10:29.661 --> 00:10:31.030
I want it to be like destiny.

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:31.632
(slide whistle chirps)

00:10:31.732 --> 00:10:32.734
But a party's a good idea

00:10:32.834 --> 00:10:33.702
'cause who knows who I might
meet?

00:10:33.803 --> 00:10:35.338
- What the hell happened
when you went back home?

00:10:35.439 --> 00:10:36.207
(laser chirps)

00:10:36.307 --> 00:10:36.742
- Sorry.

00:10:36.842 --> 00:10:37.710
Can't tell you, I'm on a secret
mission.

00:10:37.811 --> 00:10:41.184
- Since when is finding a
boyfriend been a secret mission?

00:10:41.284 --> 00:10:41.618
(chimes ringing)

00:10:41.718 --> 00:10:43.689
- Maybe my destiny is to
meet the man of my dreams

00:10:43.789 --> 00:10:44.423
at a party.

00:10:44.524 --> 00:10:45.860
- Why do you need to bother with
a party?

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.833
From what I can see your
garden's ripe for harvest.

00:10:48.933 --> 00:10:49.433
- My garden?

00:10:49.534 --> 00:10:51.337
- She means people in your own
back yard.

00:10:51.437 --> 00:10:52.206
What about the guys in Blast?

00:10:52.306 --> 00:10:54.376
- Even though they've got that
whole punk thing going on,

00:10:54.477 --> 00:10:55.780
they all seem like they're
pretty sweet.

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.284
Are you attracted to any of
them?

00:10:59.453 --> 00:11:00.255
(laser reverberates)

00:11:00.355 --> 00:11:01.424
(Hachi gasps)

00:11:01.525 --> 00:11:02.459
- No, I can't.

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:03.729
Yasu belongs to Nana!

00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:04.965
- What? Yasu?

00:11:05.065 --> 00:11:05.833
- Those two are going out?

00:11:05.933 --> 00:11:06.568
I never knew that.

00:11:06.668 --> 00:11:08.138
- No, no, it's not like that.

00:11:08.238 --> 00:11:09.273
- What is it like?

00:11:09.373 --> 00:11:09.975
- The thing is,

00:11:10.075 --> 00:11:11.678
Yasu's always taken
really good care of Nana,

00:11:11.778 --> 00:11:14.116
so one time I thought
maybe the two of them were-

00:11:14.216 --> 00:11:16.154
- Yeah, Yasu's a really generous
guy,

00:11:16.254 --> 00:11:17.590
but he's like that with
everyone.

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:19.360
He's kinda like a monk or
something.

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:21.698
I mean, he's already got
the bald head.

00:11:21.798 --> 00:11:22.934
- True.

00:11:23.034 --> 00:11:25.438
Yasu's so good to Nobu, to Shin,

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:27.042
and to me too.

00:11:28.512 --> 00:11:30.382
- Yasu's like that with
everyone.

00:11:30.482 --> 00:11:33.488
He's kinda like a big brother to
me.

00:11:33.589 --> 00:11:35.826
- Since Nana doesn't
have a family,

00:11:35.927 --> 00:11:39.768
he probably took her in as
if she was his real sister.

00:11:39.868 --> 00:11:42.841
He must really feel he's
gotta take care of her.

00:11:43.374 --> 00:11:44.811
So, that's it.

00:11:46.347 --> 00:11:47.917
He's such a great guy.

00:11:48.017 --> 00:11:48.786
- Right?

00:11:48.886 --> 00:11:49.621
- What?

00:11:49.721 --> 00:11:50.523
- You're not even listening to
us.

00:11:50.623 --> 00:11:52.192
- I was just saying
that out of all the guys

00:11:52.292 --> 00:11:53.228
for you to choose from in the
band,

00:11:53.328 --> 00:11:57.069
I can't believe Yasu was the
one you thought of first.

00:11:57.169 --> 00:11:57.637
- Oh?

00:11:57.737 --> 00:11:58.572
- [Kyosuke] I didn't think you
went

00:11:58.672 --> 00:12:00.442
for the mean-looking guys.

00:12:00.543 --> 00:12:01.310
- Not usually.

00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:02.346
But Yasu's different.

00:12:02.446 --> 00:12:03.682
Once you get used to his shaved
head,

00:12:03.782 --> 00:12:05.051
you see all the charm
underneath.

00:12:05.151 --> 00:12:08.258
Besides, I prefer my guys to
be a little older than me.

00:12:08.358 --> 00:12:08.859
(chimes ringing)

00:12:08.959 --> 00:12:09.928
I like how they're calmer and
quieter

00:12:10.028 --> 00:12:10.730
than guys my own age.

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:12.232
You know that, don't you, Jun?

00:12:12.332 --> 00:12:13.334
And you seen Yasu.

00:12:13.434 --> 00:12:14.370
He's very mature.

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:15.673
- Plus, he's a lawyer.

00:12:15.773 --> 00:12:16.875
- Oh, that's got nothing to do
with it.

00:12:16.975 --> 00:12:18.378
Take away his looks, and his
job,

00:12:18.478 --> 00:12:20.048
and he's a really cool guy
inside.

00:12:20.148 --> 00:12:22.352
- A really cool guy inside?!

00:12:22.452 --> 00:12:23.756
I never thought the day would
come

00:12:23.856 --> 00:12:25.358
when I'd hear you talk like
that.

00:12:25.458 --> 00:12:27.195
That's great, so why not go for
it?

00:12:27.296 --> 00:12:28.464
- Go for it?

00:12:28.566 --> 00:12:29.233
(chimes ringing)

00:12:29.333 --> 00:12:30.201
What do you mean?

00:12:30.302 --> 00:12:31.505
- Love so hot, it burns you up.

00:12:31.605 --> 00:12:32.439
- Don't give her ideas.

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:33.474
You'll make it worse.

00:12:33.576 --> 00:12:34.544
We were only talking about

00:12:34.644 --> 00:12:36.848
who's the best of the three
guys.

00:12:36.949 --> 00:12:37.416
- Yeah, Jun.

00:12:37.517 --> 00:12:39.086
That's all we were talking
about.

00:12:39.186 --> 00:12:39.554
(tea pouring)

00:12:39.654 --> 00:12:40.823
- Nana's blushing, Nana's
blushing.

00:12:40.923 --> 00:12:42.159
- Huh?

00:12:42.259 --> 00:12:43.328
- Maybe, you really do like him.

00:12:43.428 --> 00:12:44.263
- Are you kidding?

00:12:44.363 --> 00:12:45.131
Of course not.

00:12:45.231 --> 00:12:47.904
I swear, I've never thought
about doing anything with Yasu.

00:12:51.444 --> 00:12:52.747
That's right.

00:12:52.847 --> 00:12:55.620
Nothing can happen between me
and Yasu.

00:12:56.354 --> 00:12:57.089
Hm.

00:12:57.189 --> 00:12:58.659
(door clicks open)

00:12:58.759 --> 00:12:59.961
- Oh, hey there, Nana.

00:13:00.061 --> 00:13:01.397
You're already here.

00:13:01.497 --> 00:13:02.232
(chimes ringing)

00:13:02.332 --> 00:13:03.569
- Huh.

00:13:08.478 --> 00:13:09.547
Oh, hello there.

00:13:09.648 --> 00:13:11.217
- So, where is everyone?

00:13:11.317 --> 00:13:12.152
They late?

00:13:12.252 --> 00:13:13.421
- Nana's here.

00:13:13.522 --> 00:13:14.691
But she went out to get some
smokes.

00:13:14.791 --> 00:13:15.793
- I see.

00:13:16.427 --> 00:13:17.797
- Oh, what should I do?

00:13:17.897 --> 00:13:19.968
Junko's got me all freaked out
about Yasu.

00:13:20.068 --> 00:13:21.738
And now that we're here on our
own

00:13:21.838 --> 00:13:23.809
what I'm I gonna say to him?

00:13:24.476 --> 00:13:26.147
Huh?

00:13:26.247 --> 00:13:29.053
Yasu, I got the program
from the Trapnest concert.

00:13:29.153 --> 00:13:29.988
You wanna take a look?

00:13:30.088 --> 00:13:30.890
- Yeah, sure.

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:31.457
Thanks.

00:13:31.558 --> 00:13:32.727
- Have you heard from Nana or
Ren?

00:13:32.827 --> 00:13:34.631
It looks like the two of them

00:13:34.731 --> 00:13:35.465
are going to be getting
back together again.

00:13:35.566 --> 00:13:38.004
- Really? Huh, that's good for
them.

00:13:38.104 --> 00:13:40.141
- Hm, yeah, I think it's awesome
news.

00:13:40.241 --> 00:13:41.310
I was kinda bummed out recently,

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:42.446
but now I'm feeling good.

00:13:42.547 --> 00:13:43.314
- You were bummed out?

00:13:43.414 --> 00:13:44.416
You managed to hide that well.

00:13:44.517 --> 00:13:47.322
You seem to be doing great to
me.

00:13:47.422 --> 00:13:49.794
What's been going on to get you
down?

00:13:49.894 --> 00:13:50.930
- Uh.

00:13:52.567 --> 00:13:53.602
Hm.

00:13:53.702 --> 00:13:54.704
(suspenseful music)

00:13:54.804 --> 00:13:56.575
- Don't worry if you
don't wanna talk about it,

00:13:56.675 --> 00:13:58.946
that's cool with me.

00:13:59.046 --> 00:14:02.654
- My boyfriend cheated on me
and then he went and dumped me.

00:14:03.354 --> 00:14:04.591
- Mm.

00:14:08.666 --> 00:14:11.003
He doesn't know what he's
missin'.

00:14:11.103 --> 00:14:12.707
What a fool.

00:14:12.807 --> 00:14:16.548
- Actually I'm the one who said
I didn't want Shoji anymore.

00:14:16.648 --> 00:14:20.455
So it's not totally
true that I got dumped.

00:14:20.556 --> 00:14:24.764
I only told that to Yasu so
that I could get his sympathy.

00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:28.171
But I need to stay away from
nice guys.

00:14:28.271 --> 00:14:32.012
'Cause it's way worse
when they screw you over.

00:14:32.112 --> 00:14:34.083
But Yasu's different.

00:14:34.183 --> 00:14:36.287
I know I can trust him.

00:14:36.387 --> 00:14:37.824
If we keep talking like this,

00:14:37.924 --> 00:14:40.763
I might really start to fall for
him.

00:14:40.863 --> 00:14:42.032
- Why is everyone so late?

00:14:42.132 --> 00:14:44.103
- [Hachi] Is it okay for me to
like him?

00:14:44.203 --> 00:14:47.042
- Where the hell did Nana
go to get her cigarettes?

00:14:47.142 --> 00:14:48.111
Another country?

00:14:48.211 --> 00:14:49.681
- Maybe I shouldn't.

00:14:49.781 --> 00:14:51.651
Why don't I just ask?

00:14:51.752 --> 00:14:52.520
Hey, Yasu?

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:53.388
Tell me something.

00:14:53.488 --> 00:14:54.022
Do you have a girlfriend?

00:14:54.123 --> 00:14:56.895
- I don't seem to be very
popular with the ladies.

00:14:56.995 --> 00:14:57.897
(chimes ringing)

00:14:57.997 --> 00:15:00.101
- What?! But I like you so much.

00:15:00.201 --> 00:15:01.337
- Hey, Yasu.

00:15:01.437 --> 00:15:02.907
Ren texted back about Mahjong.

00:15:03.007 --> 00:15:04.911
He look at his schedule
and he's got days off

00:15:05.011 --> 00:15:06.915
next month on the seventh and
eighth.

00:15:07.015 --> 00:15:09.153
If we can arrange something
for one of those days,

00:15:09.253 --> 00:15:09.988
he'll come and play.

00:15:10.088 --> 00:15:11.023
- Really?

00:15:11.123 --> 00:15:11.925
- What's this?

00:15:12.025 --> 00:15:12.660
Can I play too?

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:14.531
- You know how to play Mahjong,
Hachi?

00:15:14.631 --> 00:15:15.465
- Not at all.

00:15:15.566 --> 00:15:17.202
- Then what the hell are you
talking-

00:15:17.302 --> 00:15:18.271
- I wanna meet Ren!

00:15:18.371 --> 00:15:19.073
- What's this, Hachiko?

00:15:19.173 --> 00:15:21.077
I thought you had a thing for
Takumi?

00:15:21.177 --> 00:15:22.713
You big cheater.

00:15:22.814 --> 00:15:23.916
- Don't call me Hachiko.

00:15:24.016 --> 00:15:26.655
Shin's getting less and less
cute lately.

00:15:26.755 --> 00:15:28.291
- So, anyone know where Nana is?

00:15:28.391 --> 00:15:29.761
- She just popped over to Alaska

00:15:29.861 --> 00:15:31.297
to buy herself some cigarettes.

00:15:31.397 --> 00:15:32.600
- Alaska?

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:33.367
(Hachi laughs)

00:15:33.468 --> 00:15:34.269
- [Shin] Hey, is that the
program

00:15:34.369 --> 00:15:35.205
from the Trapnest concert?

00:15:35.305 --> 00:15:36.040
Lemme see it!

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:36.708
- Here.

00:15:36.808 --> 00:15:37.777
Hachi's the one who brought it.

00:15:37.877 --> 00:15:39.179
- [Nobu] Hey, can I see it too?

00:15:39.279 --> 00:15:39.814
- Hachi?

00:15:39.914 --> 00:15:42.285
Even Yasu's calling me that?

00:15:42.385 --> 00:15:45.325
- [Nobu] These are great
pics of Reira, she's so hot.

00:15:45.425 --> 00:15:46.193
- [Shin] Oh, yeah?

00:15:46.293 --> 00:15:47.697
So she's your type, Nobu?

00:15:47.797 --> 00:15:48.632
- [Nobu] My type?

00:15:48.732 --> 00:15:50.135
Well, why not?

00:15:50.235 --> 00:15:52.272
- I can introduce you
to this flight attendant

00:15:52.372 --> 00:15:53.274
who looks like her.

00:15:53.374 --> 00:15:54.577
- You know a flight attendant?

00:15:54.677 --> 00:15:55.846
That's so cool.

00:15:55.946 --> 00:15:57.249
(cellphone ringing)

00:15:57.349 --> 00:15:58.184
- Three times in one night.

00:15:58.284 --> 00:15:58.652
- Shin!

00:15:58.752 --> 00:15:59.954
- Forget it, I don't
want your sloppy seconds.

00:16:00.054 --> 00:16:01.157
- Oh, well.

00:16:01.257 --> 00:16:01.825
Your loss.

00:16:01.925 --> 00:16:02.727
- Nana, your back.

00:16:02.827 --> 00:16:03.629
Where have you been?

00:16:03.729 --> 00:16:04.564
(cymbal reverberates)

00:16:04.664 --> 00:16:05.465
(Nana growls)

00:16:05.566 --> 00:16:06.735
(rock music)

00:16:06.835 --> 00:16:07.837
- Shin, how old are you?!

00:16:07.937 --> 00:16:09.273
I don't want to see you smoking

00:16:09.373 --> 00:16:10.442
anymore of those cancer sticks.

00:16:10.543 --> 00:16:11.711
You're such a poser.

00:16:11.812 --> 00:16:13.014
(foot stomping)

00:16:13.114 --> 00:16:13.715
- Huh.

00:16:13.816 --> 00:16:14.551
- What's gotten into you, Nana?

00:16:14.651 --> 00:16:16.086
You didn't seem to care about it
before.

00:16:16.187 --> 00:16:17.189
- She's so scary.

00:16:17.289 --> 00:16:18.792
Save me, Hachi!

00:16:20.629 --> 00:16:21.598
- Uh.

00:16:21.698 --> 00:16:22.466
- Yasu!

00:16:22.567 --> 00:16:23.535
- Okay, enough already.

00:16:23.635 --> 00:16:25.004
I get the hint.

00:16:25.104 --> 00:16:25.606
No more smoking.

00:16:25.706 --> 00:16:26.942
- [All] No smoking?

00:16:27.042 --> 00:16:27.242
Why not?

00:16:27.342 --> 00:16:28.912
- We need to increase our lung
capacity.

00:16:29.012 --> 00:16:32.252
- Reira's singing made that
big an impact on you, huh?

00:16:32.352 --> 00:16:33.454
- It's nothing to do with her!

00:16:33.555 --> 00:16:35.425
Screw you, baldy.

00:16:35.526 --> 00:16:36.595
- Hm.

00:16:36.695 --> 00:16:38.966
- From then on, Nana started
doing sit-ups every night.

00:16:39.066 --> 00:16:41.337
So I decided I'd do them with
her.

00:16:41.437 --> 00:16:43.809
(Hachi grunting)

00:16:43.909 --> 00:16:46.915
- You don't have to do this you
know.

00:16:47.015 --> 00:16:48.384
- I wanna make sure I'm in good
shape

00:16:48.484 --> 00:16:50.088
for when I get a boyfriend.

00:16:50.188 --> 00:16:50.789
- All right.

00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:51.791
Well, get going then.

00:16:51.892 --> 00:16:53.461
- If I work hard at this maybe,

00:16:53.562 --> 00:16:55.398
Yasu will start to notice me.

00:16:56.267 --> 00:16:57.269
No, I doubt it.

00:16:57.369 --> 00:16:57.870
(phone ringing)

00:16:57.970 --> 00:17:01.912
I can't see Yasu going
for someone like me.

00:17:02.012 --> 00:17:03.649
- Nana poo, can you make me some
copies?

00:17:03.749 --> 00:17:06.387
- He thinks of me like I'm his
kid sister.

00:17:06.487 --> 00:17:08.024
Not as a woman.

00:17:08.124 --> 00:17:08.659
(Hachi grunting)

00:17:08.759 --> 00:17:09.193
(slide whistle chirps)

00:17:09.293 --> 00:17:11.297
It was the same with Mr.
Mizukoshi.

00:17:11.397 --> 00:17:12.900
There's no hope for me.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.338
Maybe I should just give up.

00:17:15.438 --> 00:17:18.579
I'm too old now for this
unrequited love thing.

00:17:18.679 --> 00:17:20.649
Try and meet someone else, Nana
poo.

00:17:20.749 --> 00:17:22.553
Just go party.

00:17:22.653 --> 00:17:26.493
Ah, won't someone please love
me?

00:17:26.595 --> 00:17:29.601
(upbeat ringtone)

00:17:29.701 --> 00:17:31.036
A message?

00:17:34.309 --> 00:17:36.715
(frantic rock music)

00:17:36.815 --> 00:17:37.617
(Hachi gasping)

00:17:37.717 --> 00:17:39.386
It's Ren!

00:17:39.486 --> 00:17:41.625
(Hachi panting)

00:17:41.725 --> 00:17:42.727
A message from Ren!

00:17:42.827 --> 00:17:45.131
Ren from Trapnest sent
a message to my phone.

00:17:45.231 --> 00:17:46.601
I can't believe that this is
happening

00:17:46.701 --> 00:17:48.371
to a country girl like me.

00:17:48.471 --> 00:17:49.439
I know the message isn't for me,

00:17:49.541 --> 00:17:50.041
but do I read it?

00:17:50.141 --> 00:17:52.145
I know I shouldn't, but I want
to so bad.

00:17:52.245 --> 00:17:54.182
(Hachi gasping)

00:17:54.283 --> 00:17:54.817
I'm reading it!

00:17:54.918 --> 00:17:56.153
(phone beeps)

00:17:59.192 --> 00:17:59.827
Yes!

00:17:59.928 --> 00:18:01.397
Come over anytime, baby!

00:18:01.497 --> 00:18:03.434
So that's what I
replied for you.

00:18:03.535 --> 00:18:04.069
(tail swishing)

00:18:04.169 --> 00:18:05.506
- Don't you ever reply as me!

00:18:05.606 --> 00:18:07.142
No reward for you.

00:18:07.242 --> 00:18:10.516
- You lied, you said you'd
get me Takumi's autograph.

00:18:10.616 --> 00:18:11.083
(Hachi crying)

00:18:11.183 --> 00:18:12.720
- Hey, if Ren's going to be
coming over

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:13.220
to your place anyway,

00:18:13.321 --> 00:18:14.924
would it be okay if we had
the Mahjong battle there?

00:18:15.024 --> 00:18:17.495
My pad's not going to be
big enough for everyone.

00:18:17.597 --> 00:18:18.297
(slide whistle chirps)

00:18:18.397 --> 00:18:19.232
- Agreed!

00:18:19.333 --> 00:18:19.867
- No Mahjong table.

00:18:19.968 --> 00:18:20.736
(bubbles popping)

00:18:20.836 --> 00:18:21.403
- I don't have one either.

00:18:21.504 --> 00:18:22.773
We can just put a mat
on the kitchen table.

00:18:22.873 --> 00:18:24.142
- You mean the table
by the window?

00:18:24.243 --> 00:18:27.048
We can play properly if
we're sitting side by side.

00:18:27.148 --> 00:18:27.650
- So?

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:29.486
Just move the table out
from the window.

00:18:29.587 --> 00:18:31.457
- Stop smoking now!

00:18:31.558 --> 00:18:32.325
- Oops.

00:18:32.425 --> 00:18:32.927
- I can't wait!

00:18:33.027 --> 00:18:35.431
Hurry up, June 7th.

00:18:35.532 --> 00:18:38.471
Ren from Trapnest is
coming over to my place.

00:18:38.572 --> 00:18:39.674
Should I ask for his autograph?

00:18:39.774 --> 00:18:41.645
Maybe he'd let me have
a photo taken with him.

00:18:41.745 --> 00:18:42.513
(laser chirps)

00:18:42.613 --> 00:18:43.147
What am I gonna wear?

00:18:43.247 --> 00:18:45.018
Should I get a dress for
the occasion?

00:18:45.118 --> 00:18:46.788
I gotta get my hair done too.

00:18:46.888 --> 00:18:48.759
And make some fancy snacks.

00:18:48.859 --> 00:18:50.128
What should I make?

00:18:50.228 --> 00:18:50.495
(laser chips)

00:18:50.596 --> 00:18:52.365
I'm gonna need to start
cooking the night before.

00:18:52.465 --> 00:18:54.202
Then get up early to
clean the apartment

00:18:54.303 --> 00:18:56.574
and head off to the florist
to buy lots of flowers

00:18:56.675 --> 00:18:57.710
to fill the place.

00:18:57.810 --> 00:18:58.244
Hey, boss?

00:18:58.344 --> 00:19:00.348
I got this really
important VIP coming over

00:19:00.448 --> 00:19:00.916
for dinner tomorrow.

00:19:01.016 --> 00:19:02.352
Is it okay if I take the day
off?

00:19:02.452 --> 00:19:03.321
- No way!

00:19:03.421 --> 00:19:04.389
Absolutely not!

00:19:04.489 --> 00:19:06.795
- [Hachi] Half an hour
until I get off work.

00:19:06.895 --> 00:19:09.099
I'm sure everyone's showing up
around now.

00:19:09.199 --> 00:19:10.502
I gotta rush home and meet Ren.

00:19:10.602 --> 00:19:14.242
Oh, and I better get nice
paper for his autograph.

00:19:14.343 --> 00:19:17.115
- Sir, I don't understand
why you can't just fire her.

00:19:17.215 --> 00:19:18.785
- Eh?

00:19:18.885 --> 00:19:20.656
- Nana poo, can you make copies
of-

00:19:20.756 --> 00:19:21.256
Where'd she go?

00:19:21.357 --> 00:19:23.427
- Miss Komatsu has left for the
day.

00:19:23.528 --> 00:19:25.566
- Hm, this early?

00:19:25.666 --> 00:19:27.068
- So, let's fire her.

00:19:27.168 --> 00:19:29.006
- I guess you're right.

00:19:31.911 --> 00:19:32.647
(dice rattling)

00:19:32.747 --> 00:19:34.116
- Man, you're really good at
this.

00:19:34.216 --> 00:19:36.420
Think you could go easy on me
for awhile?

00:19:36.521 --> 00:19:37.422
- But I am going easy.

00:19:37.523 --> 00:19:40.128
- Shin, you're getting more
and more obnoxious, you know?

00:19:40.228 --> 00:19:41.831
- And I told you not to smoke!

00:19:41.931 --> 00:19:42.900
- Ren's smoking.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.572
But I guess it's okay
'cause he's your man.

00:19:45.673 --> 00:19:46.106
(Nana sighs)

00:19:46.206 --> 00:19:47.308
I never knew you were such a
push over.

00:19:47.409 --> 00:19:48.044
(pan bangs)

00:19:48.144 --> 00:19:48.812
- Listen up, pipsqueak.

00:19:48.912 --> 00:19:50.181
Underage smoking is
against the law, got it?

00:19:50.281 --> 00:19:53.020
- But you started smoking
when you were a teenager.

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:55.024
- What's with this sudden no
smoking kick?

00:19:55.124 --> 00:19:55.959
It's such a drag.

00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:57.997
No one else seems to want in on
it.

00:19:58.097 --> 00:19:59.499
- Yeah, why do you need to quit?

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:00.435
I know lots of singers who smoke

00:20:00.536 --> 00:20:02.305
and they don't have any
problems with their voice.

00:20:02.405 --> 00:20:04.076
You'd be better off
taking singing lessons.

00:20:04.176 --> 00:20:05.044
- Shut your trap.

00:20:05.144 --> 00:20:07.583
I don't need you telling me what
to do.

00:20:08.384 --> 00:20:09.386
(doorbell rings)

00:20:09.486 --> 00:20:10.488
- Hey, is that Hachi?

00:20:10.589 --> 00:20:11.591
- It could be.

00:20:11.691 --> 00:20:13.461
- Why don't you go let her in?

00:20:14.029 --> 00:20:15.264
- Listen, guys.

00:20:15.365 --> 00:20:15.933
It's Nana.

00:20:16.033 --> 00:20:16.835
Not Hachi.

00:20:16.935 --> 00:20:18.939
- Ha, if you say so.

00:20:19.039 --> 00:20:20.108
- What do I say to him?

00:20:20.208 --> 00:20:22.245
Nice to meet you, I'm Nana.

00:20:22.345 --> 00:20:22.913
No.

00:20:23.013 --> 00:20:24.416
I'm Komatsu.

00:20:24.517 --> 00:20:25.051
Mm.

00:20:25.151 --> 00:20:28.057
I've been a big Trapnest fan
forever.

00:20:28.157 --> 00:20:29.126
(door clicking open)

00:20:29.226 --> 00:20:29.794
Huh?

00:20:29.894 --> 00:20:33.367
(door hinges squeak)

00:20:34.837 --> 00:20:37.208
- Nana, welcome home.

00:20:37.308 --> 00:20:40.415
(air whooshing)

00:20:40.516 --> 00:20:43.120
(Hachi gasps)

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:47.028
(romantic string music)

00:20:47.663 --> 00:20:48.097
- [Hachi] Hey, Nana.

00:20:48.197 --> 00:20:50.969
- Okay so I made her cry now
what am I supposed to do?

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:52.005
(group laughing)

00:20:52.105 --> 00:20:54.911
- [Hachi] At that time
it was a dream come true.

00:20:55.011 --> 00:20:57.215
The reason I burst into tears
was because

00:20:57.315 --> 00:21:00.421
I knew right away that it was my
reward.

00:21:00.522 --> 00:21:01.524
From you, Nana.

00:21:03.194 --> 00:21:07.001
I felt your love, more
than a million thank yous.

00:21:07.102 --> 00:21:09.005
(rock music)

00:21:09.106 --> 00:21:11.243
You made me so happy.
