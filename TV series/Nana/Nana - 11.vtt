00:00:01.202 --> 00:00:04.643
(gentle piano music)

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.547
- [Hachi] It happened a
month after moving to Tokyo.

00:00:24.647 --> 00:00:27.319
My run of good luck,

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:28.655
(ominous music)

00:00:28.755 --> 00:00:30.726
came crashing to a halt.

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.335
(upbeat music)

00:02:02.242 --> 00:02:05.749
(upbeat music fading)

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:13.565
(table bangs)

00:02:13.665 --> 00:02:14.333
- I'm totally broke.

00:02:14.433 --> 00:02:16.337
- Why are you surprised?

00:02:16.437 --> 00:02:17.239
- Huh?

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:19.176
(Nana blowing smoke)

00:02:19.276 --> 00:02:20.178
I don't get it.

00:02:20.278 --> 00:02:22.282
I worked so hard to save
up before coming here

00:02:22.382 --> 00:02:24.621
and now I'm down to 2,228 yen!

00:02:24.721 --> 00:02:26.891
- That's what happens
when you spend your money,

00:02:26.992 --> 00:02:28.094
it disappears.

00:02:28.194 --> 00:02:29.263
You're total shopaholic,

00:02:29.363 --> 00:02:30.465
buying all kinds of clothes

00:02:30.566 --> 00:02:32.970
and every stupid piece
of furniture you see.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.809
- But Mr. Mizukoshi gives me
a deal on stuff in the store.

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:37.245
(coins jingling)
And instead of letting me

00:02:37.345 --> 00:02:38.047
pay for the clothes,

00:02:38.147 --> 00:02:40.018
he's just deducting them
from my paycheck.

00:02:40.118 --> 00:02:41.320
- So now you have a pile of
clothes

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.491
but no paycheck to
cover your living costs.

00:02:43.592 --> 00:02:44.661
(lightning crashing)
- I know, isn't it horrible?

00:02:44.761 --> 00:02:46.130
Do you think I got ripped off by
it?

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.499
- It's your own stupid fault!

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.771
- Oh, okay. What about
your situation, Nana?

00:02:49.871 --> 00:02:51.473
How come you've got
enough money to live on

00:02:51.574 --> 00:02:53.377
when you don't even have a
steady job?

00:02:53.477 --> 00:02:55.248
- Well, the difference between
you and me

00:02:55.348 --> 00:02:56.685
is that I don't spend money.

00:02:56.785 --> 00:02:57.385
- Thank goodness.

00:02:57.485 --> 00:02:58.922
- I'm not gonna bail you out.

00:02:59.022 --> 00:03:00.726
- I wasn't expecting you to do
that.

00:03:00.826 --> 00:03:01.895
- Okay, then what did you mean?

00:03:01.995 --> 00:03:04.600
- Well, wouldn't it be a
bummer if we were both broke?

00:03:04.701 --> 00:03:07.305
- I don't want you depending
on me.

00:03:07.405 --> 00:03:08.207
When we moved in here,

00:03:08.307 --> 00:03:10.713
we agreed to split the
rent and bills fifty-fifty.

00:03:10.813 --> 00:03:13.050
If you can't pay your share
by the end of the month,

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.754
then I'm throwing you out.

00:03:14.854 --> 00:03:15.823
(Hachi gasping)

00:03:15.923 --> 00:03:16.925
(ominous music)

00:03:17.025 --> 00:03:17.593
- Bitch.
- Huh?

00:03:17.693 --> 00:03:20.365
- You wouldn't care if I was
homeless and starving to death!

00:03:20.465 --> 00:03:21.635
- Whatever, drama queen.

00:03:21.735 --> 00:03:22.603
(latch squeaking)
(Hachi gasps)

00:03:22.703 --> 00:03:24.139
- Don't leave me to die all
alone!

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:25.676
- Let go, I'll be late for work.

00:03:25.776 --> 00:03:26.678
- You're going work?

00:03:26.778 --> 00:03:28.715
Where are you working this late
at night.

00:03:28.815 --> 00:03:29.550
An S&amp;M club?

00:03:29.651 --> 00:03:31.453
- That's really none of your
business.

00:03:31.554 --> 00:03:32.455
(clothes
rustling)

00:03:32.556 --> 00:03:34.694
Have a good night sleeping with
the ghost.

00:03:34.794 --> 00:03:36.698
(ominous music)

00:03:36.798 --> 00:03:37.600
- No!

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.304
(ghostly music)
(ominous music continues)

00:03:40.405 --> 00:03:42.175
This is no time to be afraid of
ghosts.

00:03:42.275 --> 00:03:44.312
When my real problem is money.

00:03:44.413 --> 00:03:45.181
I've got two weeks till my next
paycheck.

00:03:45.281 --> 00:03:46.551
(ghostly music)
(ominous music continues)

00:03:46.651 --> 00:03:48.922
The question is, can I survive
until then?

00:03:49.022 --> 00:03:51.761
On 2000 yen? What am I gonna do?

00:03:51.861 --> 00:03:53.164
This is freaking me out!

00:03:53.264 --> 00:03:54.099
(suspenseful music)

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:56.270
Having no money is really scary!

00:03:57.138 --> 00:03:57.606
(table bangs)

00:03:57.707 --> 00:03:59.677
I didn't move to Tokyo
to suffer like this.

00:03:59.777 --> 00:04:00.579
That wasn't the plan.

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:04.286
- If that wasn't the plan,
then why did you move here?

00:04:07.258 --> 00:04:08.394
(Kyosuke blowing smoke)

00:04:08.494 --> 00:04:09.396
- To make it on my own?

00:04:09.496 --> 00:04:11.968
- Then you have to figure
it out on your own.

00:04:12.068 --> 00:04:13.137
- Yeah, but how?

00:04:13.237 --> 00:04:14.473
- That's not my problem.

00:04:14.574 --> 00:04:16.477
- I can't be a dominatrix,
I don't know how!

00:04:16.578 --> 00:04:17.713
- Dominatrix?
(Hachi sobbing)

00:04:17.813 --> 00:04:19.216
- Why don't you just talk to
Shoji,

00:04:19.316 --> 00:04:21.153
and sponge off him for
the rest of the night.

00:04:21.253 --> 00:04:23.725
- No way, I can't let
him see me like this.

00:04:23.825 --> 00:04:24.861
He'll get so sick of me,

00:04:24.961 --> 00:04:26.564
won't wanna be with me anymore.

00:04:26.664 --> 00:04:28.769
And now he's so busy with school
and work.

00:04:28.869 --> 00:04:29.904
I can't just show up in
the middle of the night.

00:04:30.004 --> 00:04:32.409
He'd hate me even more for
bothering him. (sobbing)

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.114
- But it's okay to bother us?

00:04:35.214 --> 00:04:36.851
- It's all right, Nana, I got
it.

00:04:36.951 --> 00:04:40.559
Here's some cash to get you
through to the end of the month.

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:42.328
(magical music)

00:04:42.429 --> 00:04:43.565
(Hachi gasps)

00:04:43.665 --> 00:04:45.869
- Kyosuke! We don't have
that kind of money to spare.

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:47.907
- Oh, come on. I'm not giving
it to her.

00:04:48.007 --> 00:04:48.708
It's just a loan.

00:04:48.809 --> 00:04:50.478
- Right? You don't know
her like I do.

00:04:50.579 --> 00:04:53.785
Give Nana cash, and it's
gonna be spent within a day.

00:04:53.885 --> 00:04:54.887
- Why are you so mean?

00:04:54.987 --> 00:04:55.722
(table bangs)

00:04:55.823 --> 00:04:57.058
- Huh? What's that?

00:04:57.158 --> 00:04:58.060
- It's rice.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.799
I got it from my parents
and I'll share it with you.

00:05:00.899 --> 00:05:04.439
This'll keep you from starving
till the end of the month.

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.680
(ominous music)
- No way!

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.120
(voice echoing)

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.324
What am I gonna have with that
rice?

00:05:13.424 --> 00:05:15.294
(comical music)

00:05:15.394 --> 00:05:17.833
All right. I can deal with this.

00:05:19.369 --> 00:05:21.574
Payday is on the 26th.

00:05:22.977 --> 00:05:25.381
As long as I don't buy
anything from the store,

00:05:25.481 --> 00:05:26.985
I'll have 70,000 yen.

00:05:27.085 --> 00:05:31.126
But then there's my cell
phone bill, which is 10,000.

00:05:31.226 --> 00:05:34.567
So that leaves me with 60,000.

00:05:34.667 --> 00:05:38.240
60,000 should be enough to
cover my half of the rent

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:39.877
and the bills.

00:05:39.977 --> 00:05:41.581
I guess I'll survive.

00:05:42.148 --> 00:05:43.652
But just barely.

00:05:43.752 --> 00:05:45.956
Then what's gonna happen next
month.

00:05:46.056 --> 00:05:49.630
Now, instead of being
terrified, I'm just depressed.

00:05:52.035 --> 00:05:55.441
- Hey Nana, you can go for your
lunch break now if you want.

00:05:55.542 --> 00:05:56.376
- Oh, that's okay.

00:05:56.477 --> 00:05:58.481
I'm gonna be skipping lunch for
a while.

00:05:58.582 --> 00:05:59.717
- Oh? Why's that?

00:05:59.817 --> 00:06:03.424
- Well, I decided it was
time for me to go on a diet.

00:06:03.525 --> 00:06:05.863
(Mizukoshi laughs)
Huh?

00:06:05.963 --> 00:06:09.136
- I was wondering why you
weren't your usual bubbly self.

00:06:09.236 --> 00:06:10.204
(Hachi laughs)
You're hilarious, Hachi.

00:06:10.304 --> 00:06:13.010
I guess it's not the best
time to ask you out to eat

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:14.146
if you're on a diet.

00:06:14.246 --> 00:06:15.114
- Huh?

00:06:15.214 --> 00:06:15.682
- Which is too bad,

00:06:15.782 --> 00:06:18.220
'cause I was gonna take
you out to dinner tonight.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.324
(bright music)

00:06:20.424 --> 00:06:23.264
- Yay! I get to eat!

00:06:23.364 --> 00:06:24.199
(Hachi nervously laughs)

00:06:24.299 --> 00:06:26.036
(Mizukoshi laughs)

00:06:26.136 --> 00:06:26.671
(Mizukoshi tapping)

00:06:26.771 --> 00:06:28.274
- I take it, that's a
yes? What do you say?

00:06:28.374 --> 00:06:29.911
We close the store early today.
(chuckles)

00:06:30.011 --> 00:06:32.282
Start thinking about where you
want to go.

00:06:32.382 --> 00:06:34.152
- Oh well, it's okay, right?

00:06:34.252 --> 00:06:35.889
(magical music)
I mean it's only dinner.

00:06:35.989 --> 00:06:39.664
He's just being a
friendly boss. That's all.

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:43.237
I mean that's not really
cheating, right?

00:06:43.337 --> 00:06:47.580
(birds chirping)
(footsteps tapping)

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.750
- [Sachiko] Where'd you been?
I've been waiting forever.

00:06:49.851 --> 00:06:51.253
- [Shoji] Yeah. Sorry about
that.

00:06:51.353 --> 00:06:52.055
- Hmm?

00:06:52.155 --> 00:06:54.059
- So how about next Sunday?

00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:55.494
- I think I can make it. Yeah.

00:06:55.596 --> 00:06:59.302
- Great! Oh, by the way, you
know what happened yesterday?

00:06:59.402 --> 00:07:00.806
- Hmm? What?

00:07:01.608 --> 00:07:02.843
What are you saying?
- Hmm?

00:07:02.943 --> 00:07:04.079
- [Shoji] That's crazy.

00:07:04.179 --> 00:07:05.782
- No, I'm serious. It's true.

00:07:05.883 --> 00:07:06.149
(Shoji laughing)

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:08.555
- You need to be more careful
how you choose your friends.

00:07:08.655 --> 00:07:11.059
- [Sachiko] Yeah. Well, she's
always been a nice girl.

00:07:11.159 --> 00:07:13.264
- [Shoji] Are you kidding me?

00:07:13.364 --> 00:07:14.266
(footsteps tapping)
(book thumps)

00:07:14.366 --> 00:07:15.536
- Ow.

00:07:17.071 --> 00:07:18.575
- Yo.

00:07:18.675 --> 00:07:19.209
- Ah...

00:07:19.309 --> 00:07:20.478
- Huh?

00:07:20.579 --> 00:07:23.718
(whimsical music)

00:07:23.818 --> 00:07:24.486
- [Kyosuke] So that's how it is.

00:07:24.587 --> 00:07:27.492
- I know, it's a crazy
coincidence. Huh?

00:07:27.593 --> 00:07:29.195
- You work at the same
restaurant,

00:07:29.296 --> 00:07:30.498
you go to the same school,

00:07:30.599 --> 00:07:32.302
you even got the same major.

00:07:32.402 --> 00:07:34.640
I bet you two get along great.

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:35.074
- Yeah,

00:07:35.174 --> 00:07:37.178
but Sachiko passed the
entrance exam on her first try.

00:07:37.278 --> 00:07:38.213
So she's a couple years younger.

00:07:38.314 --> 00:07:39.750
- Sachiko?
- Yeah.

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:42.890
She keeps wanting to hang out
with me and stuff like that.

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:43.892
It'd be rude to say no.

00:07:43.992 --> 00:07:44.225
- You know,

00:07:44.326 --> 00:07:46.798
she's definitely the type
of girl you normally go for.

00:07:46.898 --> 00:07:49.436
Kind of petite and pale.
Whatever, stuff happens.

00:07:49.537 --> 00:07:50.739
- Hey, it's not like that
between us.

00:07:50.839 --> 00:07:53.110
- Right. Good for you for
having the self control.

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:55.916
Uh-oh, here she comes.

00:07:56.016 --> 00:07:58.153
(footsteps tapping)

00:07:58.254 --> 00:08:00.759
- Hey, coffee okay for you,
Shoji?

00:08:00.859 --> 00:08:01.894
- Sure. Thanks.

00:08:01.995 --> 00:08:04.767
- Mr. Kyosuke, which one
of these do you want?

00:08:04.867 --> 00:08:08.107
- Just call me Kyosuke, Sachiko.

00:08:08.207 --> 00:08:11.446
(Sachiko giggles)

00:08:11.547 --> 00:08:13.885
(can tabs clicking)

00:08:13.985 --> 00:08:15.756
- [Kyosuke] (sighs) She's
seriously bad news, man.

00:08:15.856 --> 00:08:16.758
- Hmm?

00:08:16.858 --> 00:08:18.127
- Well, to be perfectly honest,

00:08:18.227 --> 00:08:21.400
the type of girl I usually go
for is a giant tanned woman.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:22.836
You know, just like you.

00:08:22.937 --> 00:08:24.707
- Well, excuse me for being
real.

00:08:24.807 --> 00:08:28.213
- But even I think she's cute
and could probably go for.

00:08:28.314 --> 00:08:30.619
This is definitely bad.

00:08:33.223 --> 00:08:36.731
(snare drum beating)

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:01.179
(low drum beats)

00:09:01.279 --> 00:09:04.687
(upbeat drum music)

00:09:15.341 --> 00:09:17.345
(cymbal clinks)

00:09:17.445 --> 00:09:18.648
- Hmm.

00:09:18.748 --> 00:09:20.686
- [Shin] That was awesome.

00:09:22.956 --> 00:09:25.061
- Shin. I didn't hear you come
in.

00:09:25.161 --> 00:09:27.933
- If you play drums too, that is
so cool.

00:09:28.033 --> 00:09:29.169
- I can't really play.
(drumsticks clacking)

00:09:29.269 --> 00:09:30.104
- But I just heard you.

00:09:30.204 --> 00:09:32.475
- What you heard is
pretty much all I can do.

00:09:32.576 --> 00:09:33.878
- But it was really good.

00:09:33.978 --> 00:09:35.816
When did you learn to play?

00:09:35.916 --> 00:09:38.253
- Before I moved to
Tokyo, I was in a band.

00:09:38.354 --> 00:09:40.191
I just picked it up for fun.

00:09:40.291 --> 00:09:42.261
- Oh, from Yasu?

00:09:42.362 --> 00:09:43.932
- How do you know about Yasu?

00:09:44.032 --> 00:09:45.736
- When Nobu's had too much to
drink,

00:09:45.836 --> 00:09:47.639
he's always going on about him.

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:48.107
Like last night,

00:09:48.207 --> 00:09:49.777
he kept saying how much he
missed him

00:09:49.877 --> 00:09:51.046
and wished he was here.

00:09:51.146 --> 00:09:53.685
- So you crashed at
Nobu's again last night?

00:09:53.785 --> 00:09:55.421
And aren't those his clothes?

00:09:55.522 --> 00:09:56.824
- Nobu's at work right now.

00:09:56.924 --> 00:09:59.195
So he's gonna be a little late.

00:09:59.295 --> 00:09:59.997
(footsteps tapping)

00:10:00.097 --> 00:10:02.703
- Shin, shouldn't you go home
sometime.

00:10:02.803 --> 00:10:06.243
Aren't your parents gonna worry
about you?

00:10:06.343 --> 00:10:07.445
(bag thuds)

00:10:07.546 --> 00:10:08.480
- I doubt it.

00:10:08.581 --> 00:10:11.153
- Really? Well, whatever then.

00:10:11.253 --> 00:10:12.656
(lighter clinks)

00:10:12.756 --> 00:10:15.629
(somber piano music)

00:10:15.729 --> 00:10:17.599
- You're different from
everyone else, Nana.

00:10:17.699 --> 00:10:19.970
Usually people try to
reassure me with stuff like,

00:10:20.071 --> 00:10:22.743
"Of course they're worried
about you."

00:10:23.343 --> 00:10:24.112
- Well, I know.

00:10:24.212 --> 00:10:27.753
There are parents who don't
really care about their kids.

00:10:28.655 --> 00:10:32.028
(Nana blows smoke)

00:10:33.263 --> 00:10:34.299
- Still in junior high?

00:10:34.399 --> 00:10:37.706
The kid who came by the store
and saw the ad for the band?

00:10:37.806 --> 00:10:39.109
Didn't he tell you he was 18.

00:10:39.209 --> 00:10:41.246
- Yeah, but turns out he's
really 15.

00:10:41.346 --> 00:10:43.752
Nana got suspicious
and dragged it out of him.

00:10:43.852 --> 00:10:45.254
He didn't think they let
him join the band

00:10:45.354 --> 00:10:47.291
if they knew he was still
so young.

00:10:47.391 --> 00:10:50.231
I guess he should probably
be going to high school soon.

00:10:50.331 --> 00:10:51.901
But I don't know if he
even goes to school.

00:10:52.001 --> 00:10:54.807
- Yeah? Maybe he skipped
his exams.

00:10:54.907 --> 00:10:57.011
- [Hachi] Hmm. I really
don't know.

00:10:57.111 --> 00:11:00.351
He doesn't talk about that
kind of stuff.

00:11:00.451 --> 00:11:02.523
- I'm sure he has his
reasons.

00:11:02.623 --> 00:11:04.927
- Yeah, well, anyway,

00:11:05.027 --> 00:11:06.864
I get the feeling he doesn't go
home much,

00:11:06.964 --> 00:11:08.735
which makes me worry about him.

00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:10.839
And I bet his parents
are really worried too,

00:11:10.939 --> 00:11:12.509
not knowing where he is.

00:11:12.609 --> 00:11:13.945
- Yeah, you're probably right.

00:11:14.045 --> 00:11:16.651
- And we still haven't found
anyone who can be our drummer.

00:11:16.751 --> 00:11:17.218
It's tough, you know?

00:11:17.318 --> 00:11:18.755
It feels like we're running out
of luck.

00:11:18.855 --> 00:11:20.559
- I thought you said
there was a guy who tried out,

00:11:20.659 --> 00:11:21.092
what happened to him?

00:11:21.193 --> 00:11:24.299
- Nana didn't like him and
threw him out of the studio.

00:11:24.399 --> 00:11:24.800
It's a shame

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:27.438
'cause all the other guys
said he was pretty good.

00:11:27.539 --> 00:11:28.340
(Mizukoshi gulping)
(glass clanks)

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:31.079
- Wow. Sounds like she must
have some pretty high standards.

00:11:31.179 --> 00:11:31.814
Huh?

00:11:31.914 --> 00:11:32.482
- Maybe.
(magical music)

00:11:32.583 --> 00:11:34.252
But I think it's 'cause she's
secretly in love with Yasu.

00:11:34.352 --> 00:11:36.423
And that's why she doesn't
want any other drummers

00:11:36.524 --> 00:11:37.258
in the band.

00:11:37.358 --> 00:11:38.160
- And who's Yasu?

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.130
- The drummer from their band
back home.

00:11:40.231 --> 00:11:41.032
He's a skinhead lawyer.

00:11:41.132 --> 00:11:42.870
He's totally Nana's type.

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:46.109
- (laughs) Sounds like
they make a great couple.

00:11:46.209 --> 00:11:46.844
- [Hachi] Mr. Mizukoshi,

00:11:46.944 --> 00:11:49.249
can I get the beef and potatoes
as well?

00:11:49.349 --> 00:11:50.819
- [Mizukoshi] Yeah. Yeah, sure.

00:11:54.827 --> 00:11:55.662
(heels tapping)

00:11:55.762 --> 00:11:57.465
- Oh boy. I'm so full.

00:11:57.566 --> 00:11:58.801
This is true happiness.

00:11:58.902 --> 00:12:00.605
- (laughs) I'm glad you liked
it.

00:12:00.705 --> 00:12:01.841
I wasn't sure what you'd think
about

00:12:01.941 --> 00:12:03.511
going to a pub for a meal.

00:12:03.611 --> 00:12:04.947
- You kidding? I love pubs.

00:12:05.047 --> 00:12:07.385
They're cool. Thank you so much
for...

00:12:07.485 --> 00:12:08.287
(Hachi grunts)
(body crashes)

00:12:08.387 --> 00:12:08.955
- Nana, you okay?

00:12:09.055 --> 00:12:12.629
(birds chirping)
Oh, are you alright?

00:12:12.729 --> 00:12:13.765
- (chuckles) I think I might
have had

00:12:13.865 --> 00:12:15.735
a little bit too much to drink.

00:12:15.836 --> 00:12:17.238
I'm such an idiot.

00:12:17.973 --> 00:12:19.008
- Hmm.

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:22.850
(romantic music)

00:12:23.685 --> 00:12:24.887
- Uh-oh.

00:12:25.922 --> 00:12:26.591
Well, I better get going!

00:12:26.691 --> 00:12:28.561
- Don't go yet Nana, wait!
(hand snaps)

00:12:28.661 --> 00:12:31.834
(Hachi gasps)

00:12:31.934 --> 00:12:35.140
Nana. I had a reason for taking
you out to dinner tonight.

00:12:35.241 --> 00:12:37.746
There's something I need to tell
you.

00:12:38.581 --> 00:12:39.617
- Not so fast.

00:12:39.717 --> 00:12:42.756
- I wasn't sure when would
be a good time.

00:12:42.856 --> 00:12:44.960
I know this will come
as a surprise

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:47.098
and I'm sorry that I
didn't have the courage to

00:12:47.198 --> 00:12:49.202
bring the subject up any sooner.

00:12:49.837 --> 00:12:51.172
- This isn't good.

00:12:53.578 --> 00:12:54.145
- I know that what I have to say

00:12:54.245 --> 00:12:57.051
is gonna be hard for
you to hear.

00:12:57.151 --> 00:12:58.988
- I'm not ready for this,

00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:04.767
Mr. Mizukoshi.

00:13:06.403 --> 00:13:07.706
- You see?

00:13:10.879 --> 00:13:14.319
(footsteps tapping)
(car engine revving)

00:13:14.419 --> 00:13:17.693
I wasn't sure when would be a
good time.

00:13:17.793 --> 00:13:19.329
I know this'll come as a
surprise

00:13:19.429 --> 00:13:22.001
and I'm sorry that I
didn't have the courage to

00:13:22.101 --> 00:13:23.938
bring the subject up any sooner.

00:13:24.038 --> 00:13:25.374
- This isn't good.

00:13:27.144 --> 00:13:27.980
- I know that what I have to say

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:30.284
is gonna be hard for you to
hear.

00:13:31.152 --> 00:13:32.990
- I'm not ready for this,

00:13:34.392 --> 00:13:35.895
Mr. Mizukoshi.

00:13:36.897 --> 00:13:38.000
- You see, Nana.

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:39.970
I'm gonna have to close the
store.

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:45.114
(petals whizzing)
(romantic music stops)

00:13:45.214 --> 00:13:46.416
I'm so sorry.

00:13:46.517 --> 00:13:48.220
Business isn't going well.

00:13:49.389 --> 00:13:50.659
(suspenseful music)

00:13:50.759 --> 00:13:52.562
(ominous piano music)
(Hachi gasping)

00:13:52.663 --> 00:13:54.032
(pedestrian signal clicking)

00:13:54.132 --> 00:13:56.136
- It's really sad!

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:02.148
(train ringing)

00:14:02.248 --> 00:14:03.250
(Shoji grunts)

00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:04.586
(Sachiko panting)

00:14:04.687 --> 00:14:08.895
(Both panting)
(footsteps tapping)

00:14:08.995 --> 00:14:10.497
(Sachiko gasps)

00:14:10.598 --> 00:14:12.335
- [Sachiko] Oh, my shoe! Shoji!

00:14:12.435 --> 00:14:13.905
- [Shoji] Huh?

00:14:14.005 --> 00:14:16.744
- Go on without me. I lost my
shoe!

00:14:16.844 --> 00:14:18.013
- But...

00:14:18.781 --> 00:14:21.854
(heels tapping)

00:14:22.488 --> 00:14:24.660
(doors whooshing)

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:26.831
(Sachiko sighs)
(Sachiko gasps)

00:14:26.931 --> 00:14:30.037
(train rumbling)

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:38.788
(ominous piano music fading)

00:14:42.261 --> 00:14:43.798
- You knew we were gonna
have to run

00:14:43.898 --> 00:14:45.034
to catch the last train.

00:14:45.134 --> 00:14:47.405
So why'd you wear shoes like
that?

00:15:01.734 --> 00:15:03.136
- I did it on purpose.

00:15:04.472 --> 00:15:05.474
- Hmm!?

00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:09.550
(cell phone ringing)
Oh?

00:15:16.997 --> 00:15:20.437
(Shoji sighs)

00:15:20.538 --> 00:15:21.774
(cell phone beeps)

00:15:21.874 --> 00:15:22.909
Hello?

00:15:23.009 --> 00:15:25.515
- Shoji! (sobbing)

00:15:25.615 --> 00:15:29.489
Please help me. (bawling)

00:15:31.994 --> 00:15:34.298
(tires screeching)

00:15:34.399 --> 00:15:35.635
(door rattles)

00:15:35.735 --> 00:15:38.373
(heel taps)

00:15:39.442 --> 00:15:41.379
- Here, for the cab.

00:15:41.479 --> 00:15:44.586
- No that's okay. It was
on my way home anyway.

00:15:44.686 --> 00:15:45.387
- But if it wasn't for me,

00:15:45.487 --> 00:15:47.626
you wouldn't have missed the
last train.

00:15:47.726 --> 00:15:49.462
- Honestly. It's no problem.

00:15:51.299 --> 00:15:52.368
- Hmm.

00:15:52.468 --> 00:15:54.540
(blinkers clicking)

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:55.909
(somber piano music)

00:15:56.009 --> 00:15:58.246
Shoji, that phone call you got,

00:15:58.346 --> 00:16:00.384
was from your girlfriend, right?

00:16:01.219 --> 00:16:02.188
- Mm...

00:16:02.989 --> 00:16:05.461
(paper money rustles)

00:16:05.562 --> 00:16:09.970
I can't accept favors from
guys who have girlfriends.

00:16:18.855 --> 00:16:20.224
Good night, Shoji.

00:16:21.861 --> 00:16:24.499
(heel taps)

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:27.071
(door thuds)

00:16:27.171 --> 00:16:30.645
(car engine revving)

00:16:35.889 --> 00:16:40.364
(paper money rustles)

00:16:40.464 --> 00:16:44.573
- [Shoji] That's it. That's
all I've got to my name.

00:16:44.673 --> 00:16:47.879
- But how can you be so
broke when you work so much?

00:16:47.979 --> 00:16:49.983
You really are spending it all
on Sachiko!

00:16:50.083 --> 00:16:50.552
- No, I'm not!

00:16:50.652 --> 00:16:53.356
I've been saving up so
I could buy that!

00:16:54.492 --> 00:16:56.129
(Hachi gasps)

00:16:56.229 --> 00:16:58.200
- A new computer? Oh wow.

00:16:58.300 --> 00:16:59.202
- Pretty sweet, huh?

00:16:59.302 --> 00:17:02.509
I mean, I am starting to be
a kick-ass graphic designer.

00:17:02.609 --> 00:17:04.245
- Bet we could get a good price
for this.

00:17:04.345 --> 00:17:04.980
(table thumps)
- No way, man!

00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:06.917
- What am I gonna eat for
dinner tomorrow?

00:17:07.017 --> 00:17:07.919
I've got
nothing! (table thumps)

00:17:08.019 --> 00:17:10.357
- Here. You can have
some of these.

00:17:10.457 --> 00:17:13.831
Homemade pickled plums
from my grandma.

00:17:13.931 --> 00:17:15.902
- Shoji, you're such a jerk!

00:17:16.002 --> 00:17:21.412
You suck!

00:17:24.085 --> 00:17:25.788
And so I was out of a job,

00:17:25.889 --> 00:17:28.059
and had no idea what
I was gonna do.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:30.364
I seriously thought I
was gonna end up homeless

00:17:30.464 --> 00:17:32.969
starving to death on the street.

00:17:33.069 --> 00:17:34.038
(ATM announcing in Japanese)

00:17:34.138 --> 00:17:35.040
(Hachi gasps)

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:36.442
- 300,000!?

00:17:36.544 --> 00:17:39.482
- Wow, Mizukoshi must have
deposited 300,000 in my account

00:17:39.583 --> 00:17:40.317
to severance pay.

00:17:40.417 --> 00:17:42.556
- Are you sure it's not just
30,000 yen?

00:17:42.656 --> 00:17:44.192
If he was paying you to
the end of the month,

00:17:44.292 --> 00:17:45.294
that would sound about right.

00:17:45.394 --> 00:17:48.233
- Maybe it's so much 'cause
he's trying to pay me off.

00:17:48.333 --> 00:17:49.870
- So you did do it with him.

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:50.905
- No, I did not!

00:17:51.005 --> 00:17:51.740
- You big liar!

00:17:51.841 --> 00:17:52.274
You must have,

00:17:52.374 --> 00:17:53.611
or else why would he
give you that much money?

00:17:53.711 --> 00:17:54.780
- But I didn't. I swear!

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:56.049
If you must know,

00:17:56.149 --> 00:17:57.084
Mr. Mizukoshi's moving back to
the boonies

00:17:57.184 --> 00:17:58.588
to marry his childhood
sweetheart.

00:17:58.688 --> 00:18:01.092
Which sucks, 'cause I really
liked him.

00:18:01.192 --> 00:18:02.428
- You idiot.
- What?

00:18:02.529 --> 00:18:04.633
- Mizukoshi's not the one
who put all that money

00:18:04.733 --> 00:18:05.200
in your account.

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:07.071
Take another look.

00:18:07.171 --> 00:18:08.908
(heels tapping)

00:18:09.008 --> 00:18:10.845
- Natsuko Komatsu? That's
my mom.

00:18:10.945 --> 00:18:11.479
(gentle piano music)

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:12.682
- Looks like you got
a long way to go

00:18:12.782 --> 00:18:15.420
before becoming an
independent woman.

00:18:15.521 --> 00:18:15.755
- What?

00:18:15.855 --> 00:18:18.961
But I never said a word to my
parents about me being broke.

00:18:19.061 --> 00:18:20.965
I was scared they'd make me move
back home

00:18:21.065 --> 00:18:23.003
if they knew I was in trouble.

00:18:24.773 --> 00:18:26.577
How on earth did she know?

00:18:26.677 --> 00:18:31.452
Must of been mother's intuition.
(sobbing)

00:18:36.095 --> 00:18:38.099
Okay, then! I think we need to
celebrate.

00:18:38.199 --> 00:18:38.701
(whimsical music)

00:18:38.801 --> 00:18:41.740
So how about I make us some
sukiyaki for dinner tonight?

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:42.374
- What?

00:18:42.474 --> 00:18:43.176
(comical music)
- When I lived at home,

00:18:43.276 --> 00:18:45.414
mom made sukiyaki when
we had a celebration.

00:18:45.515 --> 00:18:47.151
Let's go back to the store
and get what we need.

00:18:47.251 --> 00:18:49.322
- You're crazy. You just lost
your job.

00:18:49.422 --> 00:18:50.525
What is there to celebrate?

00:18:50.625 --> 00:18:52.027
- The fact that I've got a lot
of money.

00:18:52.127 --> 00:18:54.766
- Are you totally insane?
Think about what you're doing.

00:18:54.866 --> 00:18:57.806
We're gonna eat exactly
what we plan to eat. Natto!

00:18:57.906 --> 00:19:01.379
And until you get another
job, no luxuries for you.

00:19:01.479 --> 00:19:06.657
(crows cawing)
- [Hachi] No fair!

00:19:06.757 --> 00:19:08.894
(footsteps tapping)

00:19:08.995 --> 00:19:09.596
- Now that we're home,

00:19:09.696 --> 00:19:12.502
shouldn't you call your
mom and say thank you.

00:19:13.537 --> 00:19:15.775
- Yeah. I'll call her later.

00:19:15.875 --> 00:19:16.710
- Oh, I see.

00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:17.278
You don't wanna call,

00:19:17.378 --> 00:19:18.848
'cause you're afraid you'll
start crying

00:19:18.948 --> 00:19:20.384
when you hear mommy's voice.

00:19:20.484 --> 00:19:23.724
- No! Well maybe I do get a
little homesick sometimes.

00:19:23.824 --> 00:19:25.695
Don't you ever feel that way?

00:19:25.795 --> 00:19:25.962
- Nope.

00:19:26.062 --> 00:19:28.935
It's hard to get homesick
when you don't have a home.

00:19:29.035 --> 00:19:29.970
(Nana gasps)

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:30.638
- What's up with you.

00:19:30.738 --> 00:19:34.345
You don't always have to try
and act cool around me. Huh?

00:19:41.627 --> 00:19:43.296
(Hachi gasps)

00:19:43.396 --> 00:19:46.704
(Yasu blows smoke)

00:19:46.804 --> 00:19:48.239
(Hachi gasping)

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:51.747
(footsteps tapping)

00:19:55.855 --> 00:19:57.091
(grocery thuds)

00:19:57.191 --> 00:20:00.598
(heels tapping)

00:20:00.698 --> 00:20:03.938
- Looks like tonight might be
a sukiyaki night after all.

00:20:04.038 --> 00:20:07.444
(footsteps tapping)

00:20:10.852 --> 00:20:13.791
(clothe rustles)

00:20:16.162 --> 00:20:18.968
- Yasu, we need you.

00:20:19.068 --> 00:20:22.174
Blast isn't the
same without you.

00:20:22.274 --> 00:20:25.648
- Yeah. I've been too
worried to sleep.

00:20:27.017 --> 00:20:27.451
(gentle music)

00:20:27.552 --> 00:20:30.858
There are lots of law
firms right here in Tokyo.

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:34.800
(Nana sobbing)

00:20:40.912 --> 00:20:43.651
(rock music)

00:20:53.002 --> 00:20:54.071
(rock music fading)

00:20:54.171 --> 00:20:56.476
- [Hachi] So Nana,
(gentle music)

00:20:56.577 --> 00:20:59.415
do you still feel like
you don't have a home?

00:21:04.626 --> 00:21:07.064
The dining room table and chairs

00:21:07.164 --> 00:21:09.903
that you made for us
are still here.

00:21:10.003 --> 00:21:12.274
And just like the good old days.
