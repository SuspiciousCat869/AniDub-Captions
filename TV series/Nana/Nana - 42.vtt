00:00:02.937 --> 00:00:04.708
- [Nana] Back then, I didn't
have a TV

00:00:04.808 --> 00:00:06.512
or a phone in my room.

00:00:06.612 --> 00:00:09.718
That's why I was the only
one who missed the start

00:00:09.818 --> 00:00:12.122
of the media circus,

00:00:12.222 --> 00:00:14.928
which pissed me off royally.

00:00:15.028 --> 00:00:18.435
(upbeat rock music)

00:01:56.464 --> 00:01:59.403
(birds chirping)

00:02:01.508 --> 00:02:04.380
(phone ringing)

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:06.785
- Hey, turn on the TV.

00:02:06.885 --> 00:02:07.654
Hurry!

00:02:07.754 --> 00:02:08.656
- What the hell, man.

00:02:08.756 --> 00:02:09.958
It's way too early for this.

00:02:10.058 --> 00:02:10.893
- Just turn it on.

00:02:10.993 --> 00:02:12.129
You have to see this.

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:14.501
- [Takakura] Did something
happen?

00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:17.039
- The guru is on TV.

00:02:18.642 --> 00:02:20.880
- Hey, isn't that
Nana's cute friend?

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:21.882
- Oh, you're right.

00:02:21.982 --> 00:02:23.084
It is that cute girl.

00:02:23.184 --> 00:02:25.055
She looks good on TV,
doesn't she?

00:02:25.155 --> 00:02:27.092
- I wouldn't call her
a cute girl, exactly.

00:02:27.192 --> 00:02:28.662
Beautiful woman would be more
like it.

00:02:28.762 --> 00:02:29.531
- What? No way.

00:02:29.631 --> 00:02:31.668
How did Nana's friend
hook up with Ren?

00:02:31.768 --> 00:02:32.971
Is this for real?

00:02:33.071 --> 00:02:33.739
How is it even possible?

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:35.442
- Would you stop your
blabbering?

00:02:35.543 --> 00:02:36.645
I can't hear the TV.

00:02:36.745 --> 00:02:37.146
- Wait.

00:02:37.246 --> 00:02:39.350
Does that mean the guy
Nana's with is famous too?

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.287
She said he's in the
music biz, right?

00:02:41.387 --> 00:02:43.358
Who is he? Tell me who he is.

00:02:43.458 --> 00:02:44.828
Why didn't you get detailed?

00:02:44.928 --> 00:02:46.965
What's wrong with you?

00:02:47.065 --> 00:02:49.470
- Any guy who knocks up
my daughter is bad news.

00:02:49.571 --> 00:02:51.207
Damn it. You girls do
what you want.

00:02:51.307 --> 00:02:53.178
- Oh, I see. You can
pretend to be liberal just

00:02:53.278 --> 00:02:54.881
to hide how you really feel.

00:02:54.981 --> 00:02:56.250
Ha ha!

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.685
- Nami.

00:02:56.785 --> 00:02:59.858
- Well, I just hope he works
for a nice respectable company.

00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.260
He's coming to meet us
on Sunday,

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.833
and I want you be nice
to him, okay?

00:03:03.933 --> 00:03:05.770
- Huh? He's coming here?

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.206
I can't wait.

00:03:07.306 --> 00:03:09.778
- [Reporter] Blast was a band
that Ren used to belong to.

00:03:09.878 --> 00:03:11.815
He helped form it back
in his hometown.

00:03:11.915 --> 00:03:14.086
- [Co-Host] Nana was 16
when she joined the band,

00:03:14.186 --> 00:03:15.990
and she became the lead singer.

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.259
She moved in with Ren

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:19.396
who was already living
on his own at the time.

00:03:19.496 --> 00:03:20.800
- [Reporter] Ren was then
lured over to Trapnest

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.206
just before they signed a
contract with a big record
label.

00:03:24.306 --> 00:03:25.810
So it must have been at that
point

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.514
that the two of them broke up.

00:03:27.614 --> 00:03:28.114
- That's right.

00:03:28.214 --> 00:03:31.254
It always gets ugly when
bands break off like this,

00:03:31.354 --> 00:03:33.792
and Nana is known to be
hotheaded.

00:03:33.893 --> 00:03:34.828
So that only made things worse.

00:03:34.928 --> 00:03:38.134
She'd apparently bad mouth
Ren to anyone who'd listen.

00:03:38.234 --> 00:03:39.103
- That's a total lie.

00:03:39.203 --> 00:03:39.704
- Shut up.

00:03:39.804 --> 00:03:42.644
It doesn't matter if it's
a lie or not.

00:03:44.614 --> 00:03:45.883
- [Reporter] We'll be right back
after

00:03:45.983 --> 00:03:47.787
this commercial break.

00:03:47.887 --> 00:03:51.027
♪ It's seven in the morning ♪

00:03:51.127 --> 00:03:52.664
- What do you mean
it doesn't matter?

00:03:52.764 --> 00:03:54.333
- Hey, Take.

00:03:55.603 --> 00:03:57.306
Yeah, I'm watching it.

00:03:57.406 --> 00:04:00.412
It had to happen when we're
too busy to deal with it.

00:04:00.513 --> 00:04:01.715
This blows.

00:04:03.084 --> 00:04:05.021
I told him to be more careful,

00:04:05.121 --> 00:04:07.760
but he just had to get
us into this mess.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:08.963
- What do you mean, this mess?

00:04:09.063 --> 00:04:09.965
You bastard.

00:04:10.065 --> 00:04:11.133
- I said shut up.

00:04:11.234 --> 00:04:13.672
You've got no part in this.

00:04:13.772 --> 00:04:15.208
I'm sorry about that.

00:04:16.277 --> 00:04:17.145
- No part?

00:04:17.246 --> 00:04:18.582
- Do you know where Ren is?

00:04:18.682 --> 00:04:21.420
He better not be with
that woman right now.

00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:23.559
Oh, really?

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:25.997
Then send someone and make
sure he doesn't leave.

00:04:26.097 --> 00:04:29.571
We certainly don't want him
going off to see her again.

00:04:30.506 --> 00:04:31.508
Yeah.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.286
No, I'm on my way to
the agency right now.

00:04:39.023 --> 00:04:41.394
Nana, where are you going?

00:04:41.494 --> 00:04:43.699
- I'm going home to see
how Nana's doing.

00:04:43.799 --> 00:04:44.567
I'm worried about her.

00:04:44.668 --> 00:04:46.370
- Please. I'm asking
you to stay out of this.

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.542
- Stay outta this?
She's my friend.

00:04:48.642 --> 00:04:52.082
There's something seriously
wrong with you as a person.

00:05:00.031 --> 00:05:00.666
- If you really think that,

00:05:00.766 --> 00:05:03.338
then why did you
agree to marry me?

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.547
If the father's life is messed
up,

00:05:07.647 --> 00:05:10.185
then the kid's gonna
be messed up, too.

00:05:10.285 --> 00:05:12.356
I'm living proof.

00:05:12.456 --> 00:05:15.428
Just having two parents
isn't enough.

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:17.432
If you're worried about
raising the kid alone,

00:05:17.533 --> 00:05:19.436
you can always move back
to your parents' place.

00:05:19.537 --> 00:05:23.512
Don't worry, I'll take care
of paying the child support.

00:05:23.612 --> 00:05:25.448
At any rate, the way
things are shaping up,

00:05:25.549 --> 00:05:27.987
I won't be coming back
here for a while.

00:05:28.087 --> 00:05:29.724
You do whatever you want.

00:05:33.031 --> 00:05:35.201
- [Junko] Hello? Nana?

00:05:35.302 --> 00:05:38.842
Is your Takumi the same
Takumi from Trapnest?

00:05:40.713 --> 00:05:41.948
- No, Jun.

00:05:42.049 --> 00:05:43.484
Why would it be him?

00:05:43.585 --> 00:05:45.288
- Right. Don't lie to me.

00:05:45.388 --> 00:05:46.390
Now that I know that it's him,

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.494
everything else makes sense.

00:05:48.595 --> 00:05:50.298
Why did you hide him from me?

00:05:50.398 --> 00:05:51.467
I thought we were friends.

00:05:51.568 --> 00:05:54.473
Do you really think I'd
go and tell everyone?

00:05:56.177 --> 00:05:57.079
What's the matter?

00:05:57.179 --> 00:05:58.982
Why are you crying?

00:05:59.083 --> 00:06:01.187
- [Nana] Jun, I,

00:06:01.287 --> 00:06:03.157
I'm not getting married to him
just

00:06:03.257 --> 00:06:05.830
because I'm having a baby.

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:07.499
- I know you aren't doing that.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.173
- I mean, I really do
love Takumi.

00:06:12.309 --> 00:06:13.478
- I already knew that.

00:06:13.579 --> 00:06:16.317
I'm glad you're facing
your true feelings.

00:06:16.417 --> 00:06:17.152
- But I don't get it.

00:06:17.252 --> 00:06:19.189
I thought I was in
love with Nobuo.

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:21.327
- Exactly. You just
thought you were.

00:06:21.427 --> 00:06:23.197
Whenever a guy showers you
with attention,

00:06:23.297 --> 00:06:24.099
you always fall in love
with him.

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:26.470
- [Nana] That's not true.

00:06:26.571 --> 00:06:29.410
- Listen, I know you feel bad
about Nobuo,

00:06:29.511 --> 00:06:31.247
but you're better off
accepting your feelings

00:06:31.347 --> 00:06:34.420
than telling yourself
it's all for the baby.

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:39.430
- But it was easier to think
it was for those reasons.

00:06:41.167 --> 00:06:42.737
Why is it that in my
relationships

00:06:42.837 --> 00:06:45.475
whenever I go after a guy
like Takashi or Takumi

00:06:45.576 --> 00:06:48.481
they always end up being
self-centered jerks?

00:06:49.149 --> 00:06:51.187
- I have no idea.

00:06:51.287 --> 00:06:53.157
She's still thinking about
Takashi?

00:06:53.257 --> 00:06:54.694
Did she love him that much?

00:06:54.794 --> 00:06:57.099
- I just don't get why I can't
fall

00:06:57.199 --> 00:06:58.902
for guys who actually value me,

00:06:59.002 --> 00:07:00.840
like Shoji or Nobuo.

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:04.379
If I had paid more attention
to Shoji when we were together,

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:07.285
then maybe things could have
worked out.

00:07:07.385 --> 00:07:09.824
- Shoji? I thought she
forgot he existed.

00:07:09.924 --> 00:07:12.462
And she thinks things
could have worked out?

00:07:12.563 --> 00:07:14.166
- If I'm like this 'till
I'm old,

00:07:14.266 --> 00:07:17.305
I'll never, ever be happy,
my whole life.

00:07:17.406 --> 00:07:18.842
- Tag.
- What?

00:07:18.942 --> 00:07:20.145
- Just calm her down.

00:07:20.245 --> 00:07:22.784
Say something that'll
make her feel good.

00:07:24.253 --> 00:07:26.323
- [Kyosuke] Hey, Nana.

00:07:26.424 --> 00:07:27.627
I just thought of something.

00:07:27.727 --> 00:07:29.898
If Trapnest is caught up
in the middle of this,

00:07:29.998 --> 00:07:32.737
then won't your wedding
be put on hold, too?

00:07:35.876 --> 00:07:40.118
- [Nana] Takumi, you idiot.
I hate you!

00:07:40.218 --> 00:07:41.955
- Anyway, why don't you
come over here?

00:07:42.055 --> 00:07:43.491
You can tell us all about it.

00:07:43.592 --> 00:07:45.663
- What about class?

00:07:46.698 --> 00:07:48.535
- Oh, thanks. But I'll be fine.

00:07:48.635 --> 00:07:51.541
I really just wanna go see
Nana right now.

00:07:51.641 --> 00:07:53.712
I need to apologize to
her in person.

00:07:53.812 --> 00:07:56.083
I was just heading
there right now.

00:07:56.183 --> 00:07:58.387
- What? To the apartment?

00:08:00.325 --> 00:08:03.632
Yeah. You shouldn't go
to your place right now.

00:08:04.166 --> 00:08:04.567
- Huh?

00:08:04.667 --> 00:08:07.472
- [Takakura] The paparazzi
are already there.

00:08:07.573 --> 00:08:10.813
- We are outside the front
door of Nana's apartment.

00:08:14.253 --> 00:08:17.660
(door bell ringing)

00:08:20.365 --> 00:08:23.404
(clock ticking)

00:08:24.808 --> 00:08:25.943
- Ah, crap.

00:08:26.043 --> 00:08:27.513
I'm gonna be late.

00:08:28.982 --> 00:08:31.688
Who's ringing the bell
this early in the morning?

00:08:31.788 --> 00:08:33.090
Yeah, who is it?

00:08:33.191 --> 00:08:34.359
- [Paparazzi] We're from Search.

00:08:34.459 --> 00:08:35.061
- From Search?

00:08:35.161 --> 00:08:37.432
Look, if you're trying to
sell something, forget it.

00:08:37.533 --> 00:08:40.038
- [Paparazzi] You're
Nana Osaki, right?

00:08:42.977 --> 00:08:44.714
We just wanna ask you a few
questions

00:08:44.814 --> 00:08:46.985
about your relationship
with Ren Honjo.

00:08:47.085 --> 00:08:49.223
- Geez, I can understand
them going to Ren's place,

00:08:49.323 --> 00:08:50.626
but why are they
at the guru's place?

00:08:50.726 --> 00:08:52.295
She isn't even a
celebrity yet.

00:08:52.395 --> 00:08:53.632
- [Kyosuke] It's a cool old
building,

00:08:53.732 --> 00:08:54.801
and with the surroundings in the
shot,

00:08:54.901 --> 00:08:57.072
people can easily
tell where it is.

00:08:57.172 --> 00:08:58.274
- They should sue them for this.

00:08:58.374 --> 00:08:59.443
What's Yasu doing?

00:08:59.544 --> 00:09:02.382
Isn't he a lawyer? Do something!

00:09:02.482 --> 00:09:04.954
- Anyway. It's not looking
too good, Nana.

00:09:05.054 --> 00:09:06.992
Who knows? They might
already have figured out

00:09:07.092 --> 00:09:08.829
that Nana Osaki had a roommate.

00:09:08.929 --> 00:09:11.601
You could end up being cornered
by a bunch of reporters.

00:09:11.701 --> 00:09:13.437
You'd better not go over there.

00:09:13.539 --> 00:09:14.908
- But Nana's there.

00:09:15.008 --> 00:09:17.713
- I know you want to go and
see her, but be logical.

00:09:17.813 --> 00:09:19.751
Things would probably get
a lot worse

00:09:19.851 --> 00:09:21.955
if the media found out
who you are.

00:09:22.055 --> 00:09:25.061
Remember you're not
only Nana's ex-roommate.

00:09:25.161 --> 00:09:26.731
You're also Takumi's fiance.

00:09:26.831 --> 00:09:29.504
You never know how it'll
all play out with the media.

00:09:29.604 --> 00:09:31.006
Think of what it'd do to him,

00:09:31.106 --> 00:09:33.779
or how hard it might
be on you and the baby.

00:09:33.879 --> 00:09:38.421
- Please, I'm asking
you to stay out of this.

00:09:38.522 --> 00:09:40.258
- Nana can handle this just
fine.

00:09:40.358 --> 00:09:40.926
She's a smart girl,

00:09:41.026 --> 00:09:43.599
and she's got the other band
members too.

00:09:43.699 --> 00:09:47.072
Jun and I are more
worried about you, okay?

00:09:47.172 --> 00:09:48.542
Don't go now.

00:09:58.795 --> 00:10:00.532
- [Paparazzi] Miss Nana Osaki?

00:10:00.633 --> 00:10:01.868
- He said he's from Search.

00:10:01.968 --> 00:10:03.939
Does he mean the tabloid
magazine?

00:10:04.039 --> 00:10:05.475
- [Paparazzi] Please, if
you could just come out

00:10:05.576 --> 00:10:07.145
for a moment and talk to us.

00:10:07.245 --> 00:10:08.882
We saw you on TV.

00:10:08.982 --> 00:10:09.984
- TV?

00:10:10.084 --> 00:10:11.955
- [Paparazzi] You know, if you
don't try to explain yourself

00:10:12.055 --> 00:10:14.293
things will just get
worse and worse for you.

00:10:14.393 --> 00:10:15.763
- Explain myself?

00:10:15.863 --> 00:10:18.434
- [Paparazzi] But if
you're okay with that...

00:10:18.535 --> 00:10:19.570
- I don't get it.

00:10:19.671 --> 00:10:21.875
Is this guy trying
to threaten me?

00:10:21.975 --> 00:10:24.079
- We'll leave you with
another look at the footage

00:10:24.179 --> 00:10:26.050
of Blast playing
live in concert.

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:28.789
Their debut single is
soon going to be released

00:10:28.889 --> 00:10:29.456
by Gaia records,

00:10:29.557 --> 00:10:32.028
and I for one can hardly wait.

00:10:36.705 --> 00:10:37.974
- [Shinichi] Nobuo.

00:10:38.074 --> 00:10:40.913
This is more than just
a little crazy, right?

00:10:41.013 --> 00:10:43.084
I mean, it's like they're
creating this scandal

00:10:43.184 --> 00:10:45.823
with Ren just so they
could promote us.

00:10:47.158 --> 00:10:50.498
(door bell rings)

00:10:52.369 --> 00:10:53.772
- [Kawano] Nobuo, Shin.

00:10:57.513 --> 00:10:58.080
You're here.

00:10:58.180 --> 00:10:59.717
- Mr. Kawano.
- [Kawano] I was getting worried

00:10:59.817 --> 00:11:02.155
'cause neither of you
answered your cell phones.

00:11:02.255 --> 00:11:03.625
- Oh, sorry.

00:11:03.725 --> 00:11:05.729
My friends kept calling
me over and over again,

00:11:05.829 --> 00:11:07.298
so I had to turn mine off.

00:11:07.399 --> 00:11:09.036
- I guess you saw the show.

00:11:09.136 --> 00:11:09.637
- [Nobuo] Yeah, but,

00:11:09.737 --> 00:11:11.006
- Okay, then I don't
have to explain.

00:11:11.106 --> 00:11:12.777
I have a car waiting
for us outside,

00:11:12.877 --> 00:11:15.048
so quickly go and pack
yourself a bag.

00:11:15.148 --> 00:11:16.250
- Pack a bag?

00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:17.485
- Yeah, you guys are gonna be
staying

00:11:17.586 --> 00:11:19.189
in a hotel until things
blow over.

00:11:19.289 --> 00:11:21.728
There's a good chance the
press will be here soon.

00:11:21.828 --> 00:11:23.097
- Just wait a minute.

00:11:23.197 --> 00:11:24.299
What the hell's going on?

00:11:24.399 --> 00:11:26.337
Since when did you guys
decide you're gonna release

00:11:26.437 --> 00:11:27.105
our first single?

00:11:27.205 --> 00:11:28.642
- [Kono] We'll talk about it in
the car.

00:11:28.742 --> 00:11:30.178
We really need
to hurry.

00:11:30.278 --> 00:11:30.879
- What about Nana?

00:11:30.979 --> 00:11:33.384
- I decided to ask Yasu
to take care of her.

00:11:33.484 --> 00:11:36.558
I'm sure he'll deal with the
media in a professional manner.

00:11:36.658 --> 00:11:38.427
So don't worry.

00:11:38.528 --> 00:11:39.262
- But I am worried.

00:11:39.363 --> 00:11:42.102
Nana won't feel like singing
with all this going on.

00:11:42.202 --> 00:11:44.774
Did Gaia have anything
to do with that TV show?

00:11:44.874 --> 00:11:47.412
That was the video
we sent you, right?

00:11:47.513 --> 00:11:48.047
- Huh?

00:11:48.147 --> 00:11:51.621
Wait, you sent that video
to other agencies as well.

00:11:51.721 --> 00:11:52.957
- I'm sorry, Mr. Kawano,

00:11:53.057 --> 00:11:55.028
but how do you expect
me to trust you anymore?

00:11:55.128 --> 00:11:58.735
I mean, all you do
is sugarcoat lies.

00:11:58.835 --> 00:12:03.745
Honestly, I just hate the fact
I can't trust anyone anymore.

00:12:05.749 --> 00:12:07.653
- [Kono] The truth
is that both Yasu

00:12:07.753 --> 00:12:09.724
and I received blocked
calls this morning

00:12:09.824 --> 00:12:12.262
telling us we had to watch
Seven in the Morning.

00:12:12.362 --> 00:12:13.097
- What the hell?

00:12:13.197 --> 00:12:14.399
A telephone threat?

00:12:14.499 --> 00:12:15.936
- I don't know who's behind
this,

00:12:16.036 --> 00:12:17.573
or what their real motives are.

00:12:17.673 --> 00:12:18.441
They set it all up

00:12:18.542 --> 00:12:20.378
so you guys are at the
center of attention.

00:12:20.478 --> 00:12:22.348
That much is clear.

00:12:22.449 --> 00:12:23.084
- Come on.

00:12:23.184 --> 00:12:24.821
Who else would pull this
kind of publicity stunt?

00:12:24.921 --> 00:12:26.891
I mean, Gaia is the only
company who'd profit

00:12:26.991 --> 00:12:28.895
from promoting our
band like this.

00:12:28.995 --> 00:12:30.666
- [Shinichi] You really are a
good person,

00:12:30.766 --> 00:12:32.135
aren't you, Nobuo?

00:12:32.235 --> 00:12:34.540
You ever think all this
was designed to ruin us

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:36.176
before we even got started?

00:12:36.276 --> 00:12:36.811
- What?

00:12:36.911 --> 00:12:40.753
- Everyone who watched that
on TV will think it's weird.

00:12:48.635 --> 00:12:51.674
(crowd talking)

00:12:54.012 --> 00:12:55.716
- You're in the band
Black Stones, aren't you?

00:12:55.816 --> 00:12:57.586
Did you watch Seven in the
Morning today?

00:12:57.686 --> 00:12:59.189
- Was it Nana who put
that padlock on Ren?

00:12:59.289 --> 00:13:01.360
- How did you feel when
Ren left your band

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:02.763
to join Trapnest?

00:13:04.634 --> 00:13:05.769
- [Girl] What's going on?

00:13:05.869 --> 00:13:09.142
- [Girl] That guy knows
Ren's girlfriend.

00:13:09.242 --> 00:13:11.981
- [Reporter] Is it true that
Nana orchestrated all this,

00:13:12.081 --> 00:13:13.417
that it's just a publicity stunt

00:13:13.518 --> 00:13:16.056
to leech off of Trapnest
popularity?

00:13:23.738 --> 00:13:25.274
- You scumbags.

00:13:25.374 --> 00:13:27.980
Instead of trampling through
other people's gardens,

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:30.084
go make your own flowers bloom.

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:34.727
(upbeat rock music)

00:13:39.402 --> 00:13:39.937
- Well, there you go.

00:13:40.037 --> 00:13:42.710
That was live from the
apartment of Ren's girlfriend,

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:44.212
Nana Osaki.

00:13:45.348 --> 00:13:48.120
- Oh man, now the press
is gonna hate him.

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:49.422
Bad move.

00:13:49.524 --> 00:13:51.761
- [Both] He's so cool!

00:13:51.861 --> 00:13:53.264
- Yasu really is awesome.

00:13:53.364 --> 00:13:56.170
I'm sorry for all the
times I called him baldy.

00:13:56.270 --> 00:14:00.579
- I wanna be just like Yasu,
except I don't wanna be bald.

00:14:00.679 --> 00:14:02.850
I had no idea Ren
was so popular.

00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:05.589
Looks like all the talk shows
are doing the same story.

00:14:05.689 --> 00:14:06.825
- I think it's kind of cool.

00:14:06.925 --> 00:14:09.730
It means the world is
a peaceful place.

00:14:09.831 --> 00:14:11.300
- But if this is supposed
to be about Ren,

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:13.572
then how come Blast is
getting all the coverage?

00:14:13.672 --> 00:14:17.345
- I never would've taken you
for the jealous type, Naoki.

00:14:17.445 --> 00:14:18.849
- Nah, I don't get jealous.

00:14:18.949 --> 00:14:20.251
I just want all the attention.

00:14:20.351 --> 00:14:21.420
That's all.

00:14:22.523 --> 00:14:23.490
Dude, we gotta get ourselves one

00:14:23.592 --> 00:14:24.326
of those press
conference things.

00:14:24.426 --> 00:14:26.631
And then we can get Ren to
say something really cool,

00:14:26.731 --> 00:14:29.537
like don't mess with
my lady friend.

00:14:29.637 --> 00:14:30.973
- Not a chance in hell.

00:14:31.073 --> 00:14:33.778
We're not gonna dignify
that BS with a response.

00:14:33.879 --> 00:14:35.549
- Okay, but don't come
crying to me

00:14:35.649 --> 00:14:37.720
if Blast walks off
with everything.

00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:38.855
- I couldn't care less.

00:14:38.955 --> 00:14:40.726
We'll just keep doing
what we're doing

00:14:40.826 --> 00:14:41.995
'cause we've got talent.

00:14:42.095 --> 00:14:43.899
As long as our albums
sell, we're fine.

00:14:43.999 --> 00:14:45.802
- Well, well. Aren't
you confident?

00:14:45.903 --> 00:14:47.940
Do you really think that
you're the best musician

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:49.342
in the whole wide world?

00:14:49.442 --> 00:14:51.013
- No, I don't think that.

00:14:51.113 --> 00:14:53.818
However, I do think
you're the best vocalist

00:14:53.919 --> 00:14:55.321
in the whole world.

00:14:57.392 --> 00:14:57.893
- What the hell?

00:14:57.993 --> 00:14:59.764
I don't need any more pressure
from you.

00:14:59.864 --> 00:15:01.901
I hate you, Takumi!

00:15:02.001 --> 00:15:03.370
- [Paparazzi] Nana.

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:05.007
- [Nana] This is the worst.

00:15:05.107 --> 00:15:05.842
- [Paparazzi] Rumor has it

00:15:05.943 --> 00:15:08.147
this publicity stunt
is your doing.

00:15:08.247 --> 00:15:08.915
Is that true?

00:15:09.015 --> 00:15:10.986
- [Nana] The last thing I
ever wanted was to be known

00:15:11.086 --> 00:15:13.023
as Ren's stupid girlfriend.

00:15:13.123 --> 00:15:13.758
- [Paparazzi] If you talk to me,

00:15:13.858 --> 00:15:15.094
I could write a follow up
article

00:15:15.194 --> 00:15:17.600
that'll explain your
side of the story.

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:18.835
- Ah, they don't stop, do they?

00:15:18.935 --> 00:15:20.004
- [Paparazzi] Nana.

00:15:20.104 --> 00:15:22.676
- Don't say my name as
if you know me.

00:15:22.776 --> 00:15:24.179
Damn, I'm finished.

00:15:24.279 --> 00:15:27.051
Vampires like you ruin
everything.

00:15:28.622 --> 00:15:29.957
- Hey, aren't you with Blast?

00:15:30.057 --> 00:15:33.464
- Get the hell outta here! Now!

00:15:33.565 --> 00:15:34.366
- Come on, man.

00:15:34.466 --> 00:15:36.236
I'm only trying to give you an-

00:15:42.115 --> 00:15:44.319
- Don't act like you're
doing us a favor,

00:15:44.419 --> 00:15:48.327
and don't ever come near our
singer again, understand?

00:15:51.901 --> 00:15:53.270
- Don't think for a second

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:55.141
that I'm not gonna
write about this.

00:15:55.241 --> 00:15:57.780
If you care at all about the
reputation of your law firm,

00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:59.750
you'll resign right away.

00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:06.496
(Yasu knocking)

00:16:06.597 --> 00:16:07.866
- [Yasu] Nana.

00:16:13.243 --> 00:16:16.016
(lock clicks)

00:16:23.798 --> 00:16:25.502
Are you all right, Nana?

00:16:26.236 --> 00:16:26.838
- You idiot.

00:16:26.938 --> 00:16:28.708
What the hell do you
think you were doing?

00:16:28.808 --> 00:16:29.710
Think about your career.

00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:31.313
Stupid Baldy.

00:16:31.413 --> 00:16:31.948
- It's okay.

00:16:32.048 --> 00:16:34.352
Around my office, I'm just a
lowly grunt.

00:16:34.452 --> 00:16:36.758
If I get canned, no one
will really care.

00:16:36.858 --> 00:16:38.160
- Yeah, but you should care.

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:41.266
No one's gonna hire a lawyer
who's been busted for assault.

00:16:41.366 --> 00:16:43.905
It's not worth
throwing your life away.

00:16:45.842 --> 00:16:47.111
- I'll be okay.

00:16:47.211 --> 00:16:50.184
Now I can go ahead and
take some risks.

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:53.023
- [Nana] Such a fool.

00:16:53.123 --> 00:16:55.562
We're in a band of fools.

00:16:57.398 --> 00:16:59.670
Nobuo just plays guitar
all day and night,

00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:01.039
even though his parents disowned
him

00:17:01.139 --> 00:17:02.543
and his girlfriend dumped him.

00:17:02.643 --> 00:17:04.379
He'll never learn.

00:17:04.479 --> 00:17:05.414
Then there's Shin.

00:17:05.515 --> 00:17:06.116
If we don't watch out,

00:17:06.216 --> 00:17:09.790
he'll end up completely
destroying his life.

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:14.834
And if I can't sing,
I have no future.

00:17:14.934 --> 00:17:16.003
- [Reporter] We are in front of
the home

00:17:16.103 --> 00:17:17.573
of Ren Honjo from Trapnest.

00:17:17.673 --> 00:17:20.077
The person at the center
of this controversy still

00:17:20.177 --> 00:17:21.313
has yet to make an appearance,

00:17:21.413 --> 00:17:24.620
and moments ago, his agency
refused to make any comments

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:25.856
regarding the situation,

00:17:25.956 --> 00:17:27.559
which only seems to add
more fuel to the rumor

00:17:27.659 --> 00:17:31.868
that this is a publicity
stunt on the part of Blast.

00:17:35.709 --> 00:17:37.345
- [Kinoshita] Mr. Honjo.

00:17:37.445 --> 00:17:39.517
I just got word back from
the agency.

00:17:39.617 --> 00:17:41.788
Looks like you have to
fly to London this afternoon.

00:17:41.888 --> 00:17:43.023
- I'm getting deported?

00:17:43.123 --> 00:17:44.527
What am I, some kind of
criminal?

00:17:44.627 --> 00:17:46.998
- No, it's for the CD
cover in the promo shoot.

00:17:47.098 --> 00:17:48.267
I guess it's been moved to
England

00:17:48.367 --> 00:17:50.037
'cause of the whole scandal
thing.

00:17:50.137 --> 00:17:51.306
You'll be staying there
for a couple of weeks,

00:17:51.406 --> 00:17:52.976
so at least that'll give you
some time

00:17:53.077 --> 00:17:53.945
for a little R and R.

00:17:54.045 --> 00:17:55.782
Everything's already been
arranged.

00:17:55.882 --> 00:17:56.984
The other band members are gonna

00:17:57.085 --> 00:17:58.220
be leaving sometime tomorrow,

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:00.191
while you and Mr. Takeda
are gonna catch a flight

00:18:00.291 --> 00:18:01.393
that takes off this afternoon,

00:18:01.493 --> 00:18:03.898
and I'll be driving you to
the airport in your car.

00:18:03.998 --> 00:18:04.700
Does that sound good?

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:05.635
- Yeah, all right.

00:18:05.736 --> 00:18:06.537
I'll start getting ready.

00:18:06.637 --> 00:18:09.543
But things will be nice and
quiet if it's just me and Take.

00:18:09.643 --> 00:18:10.979
- Um, Mr. Honjo?

00:18:11.079 --> 00:18:12.883
Don't you want try to
help your girlfriend out

00:18:12.983 --> 00:18:14.587
and give the media a
peace of your mind?

00:18:14.687 --> 00:18:18.460
Because if you wanna stay
and fight, I won't stop you.

00:18:20.364 --> 00:18:23.671
- Well, the problem is my
girlfriend has a lot of pride.

00:18:23.772 --> 00:18:27.044
If I try to defend her in
public, I know what will happen.

00:18:27.145 --> 00:18:28.948
She's gonna be totally
miserable.

00:18:29.048 --> 00:18:29.984
- Are you serious?

00:18:30.084 --> 00:18:31.319
I find that hard to believe.

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:34.760
Why do you always just do
whatever the agency tells you
to?

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:35.629
- No, trust me.

00:18:35.729 --> 00:18:36.496
She's really like that.

00:18:36.597 --> 00:18:38.701
- But a sudden change in
the schedule like this?

00:18:38.802 --> 00:18:40.404
It had to be Takumi's idea.

00:18:40.505 --> 00:18:43.444
You should do what you
wanna do, Mr. Honjo.

00:18:44.647 --> 00:18:45.882
- Kinoshita, listen.

00:18:45.982 --> 00:18:47.218
You're missing the point here.

00:18:47.318 --> 00:18:51.393
This band doesn't exist so we
can have our little play time.

00:18:51.493 --> 00:18:54.332
Trapnest isn't Takumi's
personal empire anymore.

00:18:54.432 --> 00:18:57.539
It's a major corporation that
the agency, the record label,

00:18:57.639 --> 00:19:00.545
and other companies have
a financial stake in.

00:19:00.645 --> 00:19:02.916
I can't just do whatever I want.

00:19:05.655 --> 00:19:10.364
Being in a band means having
to share a single destiny.

00:19:10.464 --> 00:19:13.638
Right now, the people I need
to protect aren't my friends

00:19:13.738 --> 00:19:15.509
or ex-bandmates.

00:19:18.046 --> 00:19:18.515
- [Paparazzi] Miss Osaki.

00:19:18.615 --> 00:19:20.351
Are you going to
make a statement?

00:19:20.451 --> 00:19:22.756
- [Reporter] When Ren got
picked up by Trapnest,

00:19:22.856 --> 00:19:24.058
was it you who broke things off?

00:19:24.159 --> 00:19:25.161
- [Paparazzi] Did you get
back together with him

00:19:25.261 --> 00:19:26.329
to take advantage of his fame?

00:19:26.429 --> 00:19:27.799
- [Reporter] Ren refuses to
comment.

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:30.437
What do you think about that?
- [Man] Tell us, are you happy

00:19:30.539 --> 00:19:33.076
that your little publicity
stunt is working?

00:19:33.177 --> 00:19:34.245
- What a bunch of idiots.

00:19:34.345 --> 00:19:36.717
- [Man] Come on, say something.

00:19:36.818 --> 00:19:38.320
- I don't have to say anything.

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:39.623
Ren knows me well enough.

00:19:39.723 --> 00:19:42.361
And I understand the
position he's in.

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:47.071
I'm not gonna make things worse.

00:19:47.171 --> 00:19:48.407
But still,

00:19:48.508 --> 00:19:51.747
right now, there's something
I feel I have to say.

00:19:51.848 --> 00:19:53.518
Something I need to get through.

00:19:53.618 --> 00:19:55.454
- [Paparazzi] Please, say
anything.

00:19:55.555 --> 00:19:58.360
- I will not let them
ruin my life.

00:20:00.097 --> 00:20:03.103
(upbeat music)

00:20:13.958 --> 00:20:15.662
Just watch me, Hachiko.

00:20:15.762 --> 00:20:19.302
I promise I'm gonna make
all your dreams come true.

00:20:21.273 --> 00:20:23.511
- I hope you make it big
and get on TV,

00:20:23.611 --> 00:20:26.383
and then I can watch
you when you sing.

00:20:27.018 --> 00:20:28.688
- There. I feel better.

00:20:28.788 --> 00:20:30.257
- I'm glad to hear that.

00:20:34.833 --> 00:20:35.334
- Okay, then.

00:20:35.434 --> 00:20:38.708
That's all from the apartment
of the now famous Nana Osaki.

00:20:42.448 --> 00:20:44.285
- Wow, she just threw
them a curve ball.

00:20:44.385 --> 00:20:46.624
I bet the next special'll
be called the fearless Nana

00:20:46.724 --> 00:20:49.062
and the mysterious
message to her pet dog.

00:20:49.162 --> 00:20:52.569
That should get 'em
all sidetracked.

00:20:52.669 --> 00:20:56.109
- Awesome, everyone's gonna
think Hachiko's your dog.

00:20:59.984 --> 00:21:01.286
- [Nana] You know, Hachi.

00:21:01.386 --> 00:21:02.221
From that day on,

00:21:02.321 --> 00:21:04.760
I could stand tall no
matter how many times

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:06.897
I got struck down.

00:21:06.998 --> 00:21:10.337
That's because I knew you
were always watching me.
