00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.586
- [Komatsu] Vivienne
Westwood, the Sex Pistols,

00:00:07.686 --> 00:00:12.294
Seven Star cigarettes, coffee
with milk and strawberry cake,

00:00:12.394 --> 00:00:14.131
and lotus flowers.
(upbeat rock music)

00:00:14.232 --> 00:00:17.238
Nana's favorite things
never changed.

00:00:17.338 --> 00:00:19.041
I used to think
that was so cool,

00:00:19.141 --> 00:00:22.716
because I'm always
changing my mind.

00:01:55.668 --> 00:01:57.839
- [Osaki] Is that
all you've got?

00:01:57.939 --> 00:01:58.373
- Mm-hm.
(upbeat music)

00:01:58.474 --> 00:02:00.444
I asked my mom and dad to
send the rest of my stuff

00:02:00.545 --> 00:02:02.515
later on, as soon as
I get settled in.

00:02:02.616 --> 00:02:03.618
I figured it was
going to be easier

00:02:03.718 --> 00:02:07.091
to just buy any furniture
I needed once I got here.

00:02:07.191 --> 00:02:09.161
- Hm.
- Where's your stuff?

00:02:09.261 --> 00:02:11.299
- I've just got my
guitar and this with me.

00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:12.502
- [Komatsu] What about the rest?

00:02:12.602 --> 00:02:14.338
- Haven't figured that out yet.

00:02:14.438 --> 00:02:15.942
- Just make me a list
of everything you need.

00:02:16.042 --> 00:02:18.881
I'll pack it up and send it
to you when I get back home.

00:02:18.981 --> 00:02:19.583
- Back home?

00:02:19.683 --> 00:02:21.520
- Yasu comes from the
same town as me.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.256
He just came down to
cosign the lease.

00:02:23.356 --> 00:02:26.329
- He came here just for that?
What about your parents?

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:28.166
- Here's the list, Yasu.
- That was fast.

00:02:28.266 --> 00:02:30.571
- Oh, I get it, you ran
away from home, didn't you?

00:02:30.672 --> 00:02:32.475
You're totally the type
of girl to do that.

00:02:32.575 --> 00:02:34.479
- And what type of girl is that?

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:36.617
- You come from some rich
family who didn't like the idea

00:02:36.717 --> 00:02:38.754
of their daughter being in a
band, so you had to run away!

00:02:38.854 --> 00:02:41.894
- [Yasu] Nana, a rich
girl slumming it in Tokyo?

00:02:41.994 --> 00:02:46.169
- She isn't?
- Why is that so funny?

00:02:47.104 --> 00:02:49.342
- [Yasu] Three boxes,
is that all?

00:02:49.442 --> 00:02:50.243
Is that even worth it?

00:02:50.344 --> 00:02:52.448
- Don't change the subject.

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:54.452
- And what should I do
about your old place?

00:02:54.553 --> 00:02:56.022
Are you just gonna
leave it empty?

00:02:56.122 --> 00:02:57.291
- I don't know yet.

00:02:57.391 --> 00:03:00.397
That place didn't really
belong to me anyway.

00:03:00.498 --> 00:03:02.201
Why don't you ask him?

00:03:02.902 --> 00:03:04.973
(lighter clicking)

00:03:05.073 --> 00:03:05.708
- [Yasu] Yeah, sure.

00:03:05.808 --> 00:03:09.215
He's so busy I can never
get ahold of him.

00:03:09.315 --> 00:03:11.019
- Then let's just leave it.

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:14.158
As long as he keeps paying
the rent, what do I care?

00:03:14.258 --> 00:03:15.360
It's none of my business.

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.233
- [Yasu] But he's been
paying the rent for you.

00:03:19.435 --> 00:03:21.039
- [Osaki] I didn't ask him to.

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:24.045
I was gonna pay for it myself.

00:03:24.145 --> 00:03:26.650
Don't get me wrong, I'm
grateful for the help.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.823
- Hey, what are you guys
talking about?

00:03:29.923 --> 00:03:30.758
- Oh, we're just discussing

00:03:30.858 --> 00:03:34.098
the lifestyles of the rich
and famous, that's all.

00:03:34.198 --> 00:03:34.733
- Huh?

00:03:34.833 --> 00:03:37.104
- Oh, come on,
Nana, don't be so-

00:03:37.204 --> 00:03:38.641
- [Osaki] I think it's
time us poor people

00:03:38.741 --> 00:03:41.112
went out shopping to buy
the bare necessities.

00:03:41.212 --> 00:03:42.381
- [Komatsu] Okay,
we're going to need

00:03:42.482 --> 00:03:44.519
to get central heat and AC.

00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:47.926
- [Osaki] How about we start
with a space heater instead?

00:03:48.026 --> 00:03:50.397
- All right, Nana, I
think I'm gonna get going.

00:03:50.498 --> 00:03:52.334
- Huh? You can't go yet.

00:03:52.434 --> 00:03:54.205
Why don't you just spend
the night here?

00:03:54.305 --> 00:03:56.477
- Yeah, you should
crash here with us.

00:03:56.577 --> 00:03:59.315
We don't have much, but
you're welcome to stay.

00:03:59.415 --> 00:04:00.685
- Thanks, I wish I could,

00:04:00.785 --> 00:04:03.089
but I've got a ton of
work waiting for me.

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:06.563
- Oh yeah, that's right,
I totally forgot you were
a lawyer.

00:04:06.663 --> 00:04:09.201
- We're going shopping, so
we'll walk you to the station.

00:04:09.301 --> 00:04:10.470
- Nah, that's okay.

00:04:10.571 --> 00:04:13.276
I'm flying home, so I'll just
take a cab to the airport.

00:04:13.376 --> 00:04:14.412
- Ooh, Mr. Bigshot.

00:04:14.513 --> 00:04:17.184
- Why don't you go and see
him off at the airport, Nana?

00:04:17.284 --> 00:04:19.556
I can take care of
the shopping on my own.

00:04:19.656 --> 00:04:22.962
- (laughs) I don't need
anyone to see me off.

00:04:23.062 --> 00:04:24.265
(melancholy music)

00:04:24.365 --> 00:04:25.868
Well, I'll see you later.

00:04:25.968 --> 00:04:28.941
- Sure. Thanks for
everything, Yasu, really.

00:04:29.041 --> 00:04:32.047
- You need anything,
just give me a call.

00:04:32.147 --> 00:04:34.385
I'll come back here anytime.
- Hm.

00:04:38.761 --> 00:04:39.696
- [Komatsu] I totally
thought that Yasu

00:04:39.796 --> 00:04:42.502
was Nana's boyfriend, or at
least that there was something

00:04:42.602 --> 00:04:46.844
going on between them, but
Nana completely denied it.

00:04:51.252 --> 00:04:54.893
- Yasu was the drummer for
the band I was in back home.

00:04:54.993 --> 00:04:55.962
He's a pretty reliable guy,

00:04:56.062 --> 00:04:58.734
so he took charge of the
business side of the band.

00:04:58.834 --> 00:05:01.473
He's kind of like a
big brother to me.

00:05:02.074 --> 00:05:03.644
- Hm.

00:05:03.744 --> 00:05:05.347
But he flew all the way here

00:05:05.447 --> 00:05:07.184
just to cosign the
rental agreement.

00:05:07.284 --> 00:05:09.054
Sounds like he's more
than a big brother.

00:05:09.155 --> 00:05:10.257
Sounds like he's in love.

00:05:10.357 --> 00:05:13.531
- Yasu in love with me? (laughs)

00:05:13.631 --> 00:05:15.033
He's like that with everyone.

00:05:15.133 --> 00:05:17.705
He enjoys looking after people,
making sure they're okay.

00:05:17.806 --> 00:05:20.277
It's one of the reasons why
he's gonna make a good lawyer,

00:05:20.377 --> 00:05:21.112
that's for sure.

00:05:21.212 --> 00:05:22.347
- So if he's not your boyfriend,

00:05:22.447 --> 00:05:23.316
is there anyone special
in your life?

00:05:23.416 --> 00:05:24.986
- Hey, look, there's
a discount store.

00:05:25.086 --> 00:05:26.255
We can get a bunch
of stuff in there.

00:05:26.355 --> 00:05:27.859
- What? This is so tacky.

00:05:27.959 --> 00:05:30.363
There's got to be a
better store around here.

00:05:30.463 --> 00:05:32.502
- Then let's split up
and I'll meet you later.

00:05:32.602 --> 00:05:36.042
- (gasps) But wait!

00:05:36.142 --> 00:05:39.281
(cheerful music)

00:05:40.785 --> 00:05:43.356
Hey Nana, look at these
glasses. Aren't they cute?

00:05:43.456 --> 00:05:45.728
I can't believe
they're only 100 yen!

00:05:47.197 --> 00:05:49.368
- Little red strawberries?

00:05:49.468 --> 00:05:52.642
- No good?
- If you want them, buy them.

00:05:52.742 --> 00:05:54.111
- No, I won't.
- Why not?

00:05:54.211 --> 00:05:55.982
- 'Cause if you don't like
them, I don't want them.

00:05:56.082 --> 00:05:57.451
There's no point
in me buying them

00:05:57.552 --> 00:05:59.489
unless we're both
gonna use them.

00:05:59.589 --> 00:06:01.292
- I don't really
care what we use.

00:06:01.392 --> 00:06:04.365
Let's just get
the shopping done.

00:06:04.465 --> 00:06:06.435
- But you don't like the
little red strawberries!

00:06:06.537 --> 00:06:08.841
- No, I love little
red strawberries.

00:06:08.941 --> 00:06:09.709
(Komatsu gasps)

00:06:09.809 --> 00:06:11.345
To eat.

00:06:11.445 --> 00:06:13.617
- Then let's get them, okay?

00:06:13.717 --> 00:06:16.422
- [Osaki] Now I can see what
Shouji has to deal with.

00:06:16.523 --> 00:06:17.124
- What do you mean?

00:06:17.224 --> 00:06:21.265
- Well, you're kind of like,
well, you know, a puppy dog.

00:06:21.365 --> 00:06:22.802
- I am?
(dog barks)

00:06:22.902 --> 00:06:26.643
- Well, you're super
friendly, very obedient,

00:06:26.743 --> 00:06:29.448
but you need a lot of attention.

00:06:29.549 --> 00:06:30.283
Works for me, though.

00:06:30.383 --> 00:06:32.855
I was thinking of
getting a pet anyway.

00:06:34.926 --> 00:06:35.995
Huh.

00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:39.736
You want me to buy you
a little treat, Hachi?

00:06:39.836 --> 00:06:40.838
- Why Hachi?

00:06:40.938 --> 00:06:43.844
Couldn't you have picked
a cuter nickname for me?

00:06:44.913 --> 00:06:46.884
We found a lot of
stuff around here.

00:06:46.984 --> 00:06:48.954
I never imagined there'd
be so many cool stores,

00:06:49.054 --> 00:06:50.591
considering we're so
far out in the 'burbs.

00:06:50.691 --> 00:06:54.866
It's so convenient. I'm
gonna love living in Tokyo.

00:06:54.966 --> 00:06:55.568
- Now all we need to get

00:06:55.668 --> 00:06:59.208
are the futons, a space
heater, lamps, a fridge.

00:06:59.308 --> 00:07:00.478
How are we gonna carry all that?

00:07:00.578 --> 00:07:03.584
- Huh.
(upbeat music)

00:07:07.625 --> 00:07:10.297
Hey, Nana, there's lots
of great stuff in here.

00:07:10.397 --> 00:07:11.667
Let's go in, take a look.

00:07:11.767 --> 00:07:14.371
- We can get furniture
later. Come on, Hachi.

00:07:14.471 --> 00:07:15.575
- Aw, but look at all
the pretty lamps!

00:07:15.675 --> 00:07:19.114
- Really? All right
then, let's check it out.

00:07:19.214 --> 00:07:19.883
(Komatsu sighs)

00:07:19.983 --> 00:07:22.755
Wow, some of these
things are really cool.

00:07:23.389 --> 00:07:25.093
And cheap, too. (laughs)

00:07:25.193 --> 00:07:28.701
Way to go, Hachiko.
(Komatsu giggles)

00:07:28.801 --> 00:07:31.573
- Aw, this heater is so cute.

00:07:31.673 --> 00:07:33.009
- I'm getting this for my room.

00:07:33.109 --> 00:07:33.978
- Uh-huh, uh-huh!

00:07:34.078 --> 00:07:37.084
- And we can put that
in the living room.

00:07:40.357 --> 00:07:40.958
- It's adorable!

00:07:41.058 --> 00:07:42.795
- This looks like
it's from the 50s.

00:07:42.895 --> 00:07:44.098
Do you think it
still works okay?

00:07:44.198 --> 00:07:47.739
- [Mizukoshi] Absolutely.
It's in really good shape.

00:07:47.839 --> 00:07:48.039
- Huh?

00:07:48.139 --> 00:07:50.010
- Feel free to look around
as much as you want.

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:51.813
Everything in the store
is secondhand vintage

00:07:51.913 --> 00:07:54.051
from the 50s, 60s, and 70s.

00:07:54.151 --> 00:07:55.521
I get my stock by going overseas

00:07:55.621 --> 00:07:57.324
and buying all my
merchandise wholesale,

00:07:57.424 --> 00:07:58.861
which helps to keep
the prices down.

00:07:58.961 --> 00:08:00.196
- Really? That's cool.
(whimsical music)

00:08:00.297 --> 00:08:02.067
You travel overseas on business.

00:08:02.167 --> 00:08:03.737
- What's with that voice?

00:08:03.837 --> 00:08:04.906
- Yeah, and you
don't have to worry,

00:08:05.006 --> 00:08:07.277
everything's cheap, but it's
all in good working order.

00:08:07.377 --> 00:08:09.549
Normally, this stuff would
be way more expensive.

00:08:09.649 --> 00:08:11.452
I just don't make
any profit on it.

00:08:11.553 --> 00:08:12.287
(both laughing)

00:08:12.387 --> 00:08:15.160
- [Osaki] Hey, quit with the
flirting and make up your mind.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.932
- Everything in here is so
nice, I just can't decide.

00:08:18.032 --> 00:08:20.470
- [Mizukoshi] So, what kind
of stuff you looking for?

00:08:20.571 --> 00:08:21.707
- All sorts of things.

00:08:21.807 --> 00:08:24.679
We just moved, and we don't
have anything in our apartment.

00:08:24.779 --> 00:08:26.483
- [Mizukoshi] What do you
think of these chairs?

00:08:26.583 --> 00:08:28.654
They fold up and come as a pair.

00:08:28.754 --> 00:08:32.427
- I'll take them.
- Ooh, and how about this?

00:08:32.528 --> 00:08:34.532
It's so cute, and it's so you.

00:08:34.632 --> 00:08:36.737
- In that case,
I'll take it too!

00:08:36.837 --> 00:08:39.909
- At least check it first.
(cash register dinging)

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:42.849
- (laughs) So your names
are Nana and Hachi?

00:08:42.949 --> 00:08:44.753
Seven and eight, great combo.

00:08:44.853 --> 00:08:45.755
- That's not really my name.

00:08:45.855 --> 00:08:47.391
You see, I'm called
Nana as well,

00:08:47.492 --> 00:08:48.861
but this Nana thought
it was too confusing

00:08:48.961 --> 00:08:51.198
for us both to have the
same name, so she decided-

00:08:51.298 --> 00:08:51.900
- I thought it was

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.771
'cause you're like that
puppy called Hachiko.

00:08:53.871 --> 00:08:57.444
- (laughs) Well, I hope you
stop by the store again.

00:08:57.545 --> 00:08:59.081
- Yeah, you betcha we will!

00:08:59.181 --> 00:09:01.118
- So about the fridge
and the washing machine,

00:09:01.218 --> 00:09:02.488
when do you think
you're gonna be able

00:09:02.588 --> 00:09:04.124
to deliver them
to the apartment?

00:09:04.224 --> 00:09:07.030
- I can bring them over
tonight after I close up here,

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:07.865
if that's okay with you.

00:09:07.965 --> 00:09:10.403
It's not that far.
- Thanks, that'd be great.

00:09:10.504 --> 00:09:12.909
Since you're coming anyway,
maybe you could take these?

00:09:13.009 --> 00:09:14.078
- Nana, hold on a second.

00:09:14.178 --> 00:09:16.950
We can't ask Mr. Mizukoshi
to do that for us.

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:18.921
- No, it's cool with
me. It's on my way home.

00:09:19.021 --> 00:09:21.158
- Oh, Mr. Mizukoshi,
that's so sweet of you.

00:09:21.258 --> 00:09:23.697
Is everyone in Tokyo
always this nice?

00:09:23.797 --> 00:09:26.268
- Since when did you
find out this guy's name?

00:09:26.368 --> 00:09:28.907
- I wish I could make it over
to your place before dark

00:09:29.007 --> 00:09:30.745
to help you get the
lights installed,

00:09:30.845 --> 00:09:32.114
but my only employee just quit,

00:09:32.214 --> 00:09:34.753
so I've got to stay here till
closing to run the store.

00:09:34.853 --> 00:09:37.892
- If you need someone,
then why don't you hire me?

00:09:40.598 --> 00:09:41.900
(dog barking)

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.204
(cheerful music)

00:09:44.304 --> 00:09:46.142
This is awesome! I'm so lucky!

00:09:46.242 --> 00:09:48.413
I can't believe I landed
myself a job just like that!

00:09:48.514 --> 00:09:50.885
I love Tokyo, and
Tokyo loves me.

00:09:50.985 --> 00:09:52.822
Thank you, demon lord, thank
you, thank you, thank you!

00:09:52.922 --> 00:09:55.360
- You begged for it.
- Huh? It's not like that.

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:57.698
I gave him my resume because
it's such a cool store

00:09:57.799 --> 00:09:59.536
and I want to work there,
it's got nothing to do

00:09:59.636 --> 00:10:01.540
with the fact that
Mr. Mizukoshi's 29,

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.744
smoking hot, and
probably available.

00:10:03.844 --> 00:10:05.380
- When did you find that out?

00:10:05.481 --> 00:10:09.455
- Can you believe he's
almost 30? I was so shocked.

00:10:09.556 --> 00:10:10.123
I mean, I thought

00:10:10.223 --> 00:10:12.595
he was more like in his
early 20s, you know?

00:10:12.695 --> 00:10:13.396
- Oh yeah, I remember,

00:10:13.497 --> 00:10:15.835
you're a total fall in
love at first sight freak.

00:10:15.935 --> 00:10:17.805
- What? What do you
mean by that?

00:10:17.905 --> 00:10:19.943
- You pretty much told me
everything about yourself

00:10:20.043 --> 00:10:22.347
on the train when we
first met, remember?

00:10:22.447 --> 00:10:24.284
- Oh, yeah, maybe I did.

00:10:24.384 --> 00:10:24.886
- But to be honest,

00:10:24.986 --> 00:10:27.390
I don't understand what you
see in that Mizukoshi guy.

00:10:27.492 --> 00:10:28.494
He certainly doesn't
do it for me.

00:10:28.594 --> 00:10:32.702
- Then what is your type? What
kind of guy do you go for?

00:10:32.802 --> 00:10:34.706
- My type?

00:10:34.806 --> 00:10:37.612
- Okay then, is there
someone famous you like?

00:10:37.712 --> 00:10:41.318
- Sid Vicious.
- From Sex Pistols?

00:10:41.418 --> 00:10:42.755
- You know who he is?

00:10:42.855 --> 00:10:45.360
Don't tell me you like
the Sex Pistols.

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:46.028
- [Komatsu] Not really.

00:10:46.128 --> 00:10:48.967
But I did see that movie,
"Sid and Nancy."

00:10:49.067 --> 00:10:52.073
- Go figure, you're
just like everyone else.

00:10:52.174 --> 00:10:55.246
- Hey Nana, the futons
are on the 7th floor.

00:10:55.346 --> 00:10:57.350
- The number seven again?

00:10:58.487 --> 00:10:58.987
- [Komatsu] You know, Nana,

00:10:59.087 --> 00:11:00.724
I was just wondering
about something.

00:11:00.825 --> 00:11:02.294
- Yeah? What's up, Hachi?

00:11:02.394 --> 00:11:03.897
- Don't you think we
shouldn't be wearing

00:11:03.997 --> 00:11:05.634
our shoes inside the apartment?

00:11:05.734 --> 00:11:07.738
I mean, we are still
in Japan, right?

00:11:07.839 --> 00:11:09.441
- And your problem is?

00:11:09.542 --> 00:11:10.043
- Well, doesn't it bother you

00:11:10.143 --> 00:11:12.815
that the futons are gonna
be on the floor?

00:11:12.915 --> 00:11:14.652
Aren't they gonna get dirty?

00:11:14.752 --> 00:11:16.288
- Guess we could
use sleeping bags.

00:11:16.388 --> 00:11:19.127
- Uh-uh!
(upbeat music)

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:21.700
- You got any beds, Mizukoshi?

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.402
- [Mizukoshi] Nice to
see you again.

00:11:27.377 --> 00:11:28.179
- [Komatsu] That was great!

00:11:28.279 --> 00:11:30.016
Now we've got everything
we need to start living

00:11:30.116 --> 00:11:33.422
in the apartment, and wasn't
that sweet of Mr. Mizukoshi

00:11:33.524 --> 00:11:35.026
to give us such a good deal?

00:11:35.126 --> 00:11:35.928
- [Osaki] Well, he should,

00:11:36.028 --> 00:11:38.266
after all the stuff we
bought from him today.

00:11:38.366 --> 00:11:39.802
(phone ringing)

00:11:39.903 --> 00:11:41.640
- Hello, this is Nana.

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:43.342
- Weren't we calling you Hachi?

00:11:43.442 --> 00:11:44.612
- Oh, hi there, Shouji.

00:11:44.712 --> 00:11:45.981
I'm just on my way
home with Nana.

00:11:46.081 --> 00:11:48.987
We totally shopped
till we dropped.

00:11:49.087 --> 00:11:50.791
Uh-huh, I haven't been
buttering her up at all.

00:11:50.891 --> 00:11:52.562
We're having so
much fun together.

00:11:52.662 --> 00:11:53.229
- Oh, really?

00:11:53.329 --> 00:11:54.966
- What about you?
You still at work?

00:11:55.066 --> 00:11:58.339
- Yeah, but it looks like
they're gonna let me off

00:11:58.439 --> 00:11:59.709
early tonight, so you want to go

00:11:59.809 --> 00:12:01.278
have dinner with me
at Jackson's later?

00:12:01.378 --> 00:12:03.115
You said you wanted
to go there, right?

00:12:03.216 --> 00:12:05.286
- [Komatsu] That's your
favorite hangout, isn't it?

00:12:05.386 --> 00:12:06.723
Yes please, yes please!

00:12:06.823 --> 00:12:08.694
Hey Nana, you want
to come with us?

00:12:08.794 --> 00:12:10.698
Shouji's offering to
treat us both to dinner.

00:12:10.798 --> 00:12:12.835
- Hey, I never said
I was gonna do that.

00:12:12.935 --> 00:12:14.672
- [Osaki] Don't forget,
Mizukoshi's coming over.

00:12:14.772 --> 00:12:15.774
One of us has to stay home.

00:12:15.875 --> 00:12:18.346
- Oh yeah.
- Mizukoshi?

00:12:18.446 --> 00:12:19.248
- Don't worry about it.

00:12:19.348 --> 00:12:22.053
I'm happy to stay home while
you go on your hot date.

00:12:22.153 --> 00:12:23.289
- Yeah, but-
- Hey, Nana-

00:12:23.389 --> 00:12:26.496
- Unless you're thinking of
dumping Shouji for Mizukoshi.

00:12:26.596 --> 00:12:30.103
- Hello, Shouji? So, where
and when are we gonna meet up?

00:12:30.203 --> 00:12:32.240
- [Shouji] Who's this Mizukoshi?

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:34.579
- The old guy from
the furniture store.

00:12:34.679 --> 00:12:36.750
(Osaki laughing)

00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:38.921
Nana, why did you have
to go and say that?

00:12:39.021 --> 00:12:40.223
And right into the phone, too.

00:12:40.323 --> 00:12:42.160
Now Shouji's gonna
assume something's up,

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.298
and I start working
with Mr. Mizukoshi

00:12:44.398 --> 00:12:45.634
at the store tomorrow!

00:12:45.734 --> 00:12:47.137
- If you stop flirting so much,

00:12:47.237 --> 00:12:50.009
Shouji won't have anything
to be suspicious about.

00:12:50.109 --> 00:12:51.345
- Aw.

00:12:51.445 --> 00:12:54.652
Hey Nana, can we just pop into
that music store over there?

00:12:54.752 --> 00:12:57.424
There's a CD I want to get.
- Yeah, sure.

00:12:57.525 --> 00:12:58.527
Do you have a CD player?

00:12:58.627 --> 00:12:59.394
- Ah.

00:12:59.495 --> 00:13:01.398
- If you don't mind a
little portable thing,

00:13:01.499 --> 00:13:02.768
you can borrow mine.

00:13:02.868 --> 00:13:06.610
- Thanks, Nana!
(upbeat music)

00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:09.214
Hope they're not sold out!

00:13:11.218 --> 00:13:12.253
- Huh?

00:13:30.056 --> 00:13:33.530
(lighter clattering)

00:13:34.599 --> 00:13:37.437
(somber music)

00:13:53.603 --> 00:13:55.741
- How great is this?
They have some left!

00:13:55.841 --> 00:13:59.014
It's the latest Trapnest album,
and it just got released.

00:13:59.114 --> 00:14:01.218
They're my favorite band ever.

00:14:04.826 --> 00:14:06.228
You can listen to
it whenever you want.

00:14:06.328 --> 00:14:08.132
They're so cool,
you're gonna love it.

00:14:08.232 --> 00:14:10.269
Hang on a minute while I go pay.

00:14:23.897 --> 00:14:25.299
Sorry I kept you waiting.

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:27.872
Look, I got a free
poster with it!

00:14:28.707 --> 00:14:29.609
- I hope you're not planning

00:14:29.709 --> 00:14:30.978
to put that up in the apartment.

00:14:31.078 --> 00:14:32.447
- Why not? I'll just
put it up in my room.

00:14:32.548 --> 00:14:34.952
- You're not in junior high!
- I'm they're biggest fan.

00:14:35.053 --> 00:14:37.123
I'm in the fan club
and everything.

00:14:37.223 --> 00:14:38.694
They've got a
concert coming up soon.

00:14:38.794 --> 00:14:41.398
I already ordered tickets,
do you want to go with me?

00:14:41.499 --> 00:14:42.233
- No. Take Shouji.

00:14:42.333 --> 00:14:44.037
- I thought about that, but
he wouldn't have much fun

00:14:44.137 --> 00:14:45.541
standing next to me while
I scream my head off

00:14:45.641 --> 00:14:48.780
for another guy, it's got
to be a girl's night out.

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:51.085
I totally love Takumi,
the guy on bass.

00:14:51.185 --> 00:14:51.986
- [Osaki] Really?

00:14:52.087 --> 00:14:54.157
- Naoki the drummer
is pretty cool, too,

00:14:54.257 --> 00:14:57.565
but the best thing about
Trapnest is their singing,
Reira.

00:14:57.665 --> 00:15:00.436
She's got great looks
and an amazing voice.

00:15:00.537 --> 00:15:03.175
- Hey, what about him?
- Who? Which one?

00:15:03.275 --> 00:15:06.516
- The guy on the guitar, the
one who really stands out.

00:15:06.616 --> 00:15:08.386
- Oh, Ren.
- Oh?

00:15:08.487 --> 00:15:11.191
- Well, I guess he is
the most popular,

00:15:11.291 --> 00:15:12.193
but I think he's kind of scary.

00:15:12.293 --> 00:15:16.636
He's totally not my type.
(Osaki laughing)

00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:18.540
What's so funny?

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:19.742
- Oh, it's nothing.

00:15:19.842 --> 00:15:21.011
How do you like that, Ren?

00:15:21.111 --> 00:15:22.548
- Hey, don't you think
Ren's sort of got

00:15:22.648 --> 00:15:24.819
a Sid Vicious Sex
Pistols thing going on?

00:15:24.919 --> 00:15:28.025
- You think? Sid's a
million times cooler.

00:15:29.361 --> 00:15:31.131
- [Komatsu] Nana, you
dropped your lighter!

00:15:31.231 --> 00:15:32.968
- [Osaki] Oh, thanks.

00:15:35.641 --> 00:15:37.812
- So Nana, are you
sure you don't mind

00:15:37.912 --> 00:15:39.949
me going out for
dinner without you?

00:15:40.049 --> 00:15:41.185
- No, it's fine with me.

00:15:41.285 --> 00:15:43.089
You're gonna be out
all night, right?

00:15:43.189 --> 00:15:45.426
- What about you? Do
you have a date tonight?

00:15:45.527 --> 00:15:48.065
- (laughs) No.
- Don't you have a boyfriend?

00:15:48.165 --> 00:15:50.269
- No, not really.
- I knew it!

00:15:50.369 --> 00:15:52.608
- Huh?
- You've got a thing for Yasu.

00:15:52.708 --> 00:15:55.113
I had a feeling there was
something between you.

00:15:55.213 --> 00:15:57.485
I know you've got a lot going
on in your life right now,

00:15:57.585 --> 00:16:00.991
but don't let pride
stand in your way,

00:16:01.091 --> 00:16:03.663
or you're never gonna be happy.

00:16:03.763 --> 00:16:05.767
- Thanks for the
words of wisdom.

00:16:05.868 --> 00:16:08.005
- You're welcome. See you later.

00:16:10.076 --> 00:16:13.750
Oh, say hi to Mr. Mizukoshi,
29 years old, for me!

00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:16.689
(Osaki laughs)

00:16:17.658 --> 00:16:20.396
(door thuds)

00:16:22.167 --> 00:16:24.237
- Hm, she left her
door wide open.

00:16:24.337 --> 00:16:27.010
So much for putting
locks on the doors.

00:16:30.183 --> 00:16:32.588
- [Komatsu] Don't let
pride stand in your way,

00:16:32.688 --> 00:16:34.457
or you're never gonna be happy.

00:16:36.863 --> 00:16:40.236
(melancholy music)

00:16:50.657 --> 00:16:52.628
(lock clicking)

00:16:52.728 --> 00:16:56.736
- How do you like this? I
bought it off a street vendor.

00:16:56.836 --> 00:17:00.777
Sid Vicious padlock.
- Does that mean you're Nancy?

00:17:00.878 --> 00:17:02.213
- Hm.

00:17:02.313 --> 00:17:04.752
- So you think you
can lock me up.

00:17:06.789 --> 00:17:10.162
- Hey, Ren, tell me,
if I was gonna die,

00:17:10.263 --> 00:17:12.467
would you die along with me?

00:17:18.613 --> 00:17:20.116
- Yeah, I would.

00:17:27.263 --> 00:17:29.669
- I spent so many
years being alone.

00:17:30.871 --> 00:17:35.146
I don't ever want to feel
lonely like that again.

00:17:59.829 --> 00:18:03.737
- Thanks for dinner, Shouji.
That was really yummy.

00:18:03.837 --> 00:18:06.976
- You ate one hell of a
lot of food, greedy pig.

00:18:07.076 --> 00:18:09.014
- That's 'cause
the food here rocks.

00:18:09.114 --> 00:18:11.218
That burger was great,
best I've ever had.

00:18:11.318 --> 00:18:13.556
- Hey Nana, now that you're
working over at Sabrina's,

00:18:13.657 --> 00:18:15.226
you should swing by
for lunch sometime.

00:18:15.326 --> 00:18:17.030
- [Komatsu] Sure,
I'll be here every day,

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:18.500
Koichi Sato, my man.

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:22.006
- Already buddying up with
him. You only just met the guy.

00:18:22.106 --> 00:18:23.910
- Hey, everything
that's on the menu here

00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:25.379
is available for takeout, right?

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:28.152
Can I get something to go?
Give me a Jackson burger.

00:18:28.252 --> 00:18:29.822
- Coming up.
- You're having more?

00:18:29.922 --> 00:18:33.462
- It's not for me, I want
to take one home for Nana.

00:18:33.563 --> 00:18:34.565
- Oh, I get it.

00:18:34.665 --> 00:18:37.738
- [Koichi] I'll start making
it now. Won't be long.

00:18:40.677 --> 00:18:42.581
- You're not thinking
of going home already.

00:18:42.681 --> 00:18:43.683
It's only 10 o'clock.
(melancholy music)

00:18:43.783 --> 00:18:45.787
- Mm-hm, I know, but
I want to make sure

00:18:45.887 --> 00:18:48.025
Nana gets her burger
before it gets cold.

00:18:48.125 --> 00:18:50.363
- Then drop it off and
head over to my place.

00:18:50.463 --> 00:18:51.431
- Shouji, are you drunk?

00:18:51.532 --> 00:18:53.737
I can see exactly why
you want me to come over.

00:18:53.837 --> 00:18:56.476
- Come on, sometimes a guy-
- It's not just sometimes.

00:18:56.576 --> 00:18:58.445
It's been every day
since I arrived.

00:18:58.546 --> 00:18:59.080
Even yesterday,

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:01.118
when you said you were
tired, we did it twice.

00:19:01.218 --> 00:19:03.422
- There's nothing wrong
with that, is there?

00:19:03.523 --> 00:19:04.759
We got to make the
most of the fact

00:19:04.859 --> 00:19:07.564
that we can see each
other every day now.

00:19:07.665 --> 00:19:11.305
- I guess so. I still
feel like I'm dreaming.

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:16.148
But not tonight.

00:19:16.248 --> 00:19:21.726
Taxi!
(wheels screeching)

00:19:24.598 --> 00:19:25.600
- Why not?

00:19:25.701 --> 00:19:28.138
- I'm worried about Nana being
stuck at home on her own.

00:19:28.238 --> 00:19:29.074
She'll be lonely.

00:19:29.174 --> 00:19:31.111
- She's not the kind of
girl who gets lonely.

00:19:31.211 --> 00:19:32.447
Besides, why waste your money

00:19:32.548 --> 00:19:34.050
on a cab when you live so close?

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:34.652
I'll walk you home.

00:19:34.752 --> 00:19:37.223
- I'll be okay, I got
myself a job today.

00:19:37.323 --> 00:19:38.560
Besides, the
burger's getting cold,

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:40.429
so I need to get it
to Nana right away.

00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:42.166
- Aren't you going
a bit overboard?

00:19:42.266 --> 00:19:44.538
- Bye bye! I'm ready to go now.

00:19:49.114 --> 00:19:52.220
- She's so into Nana.
I don't get it.

00:19:53.523 --> 00:19:54.725
- I'm really sorry, Shouji.

00:19:54.825 --> 00:19:59.401
It's okay if you stay
at Sachiko's tonight.

00:20:05.981 --> 00:20:08.018
(wheels screeching)

00:20:08.118 --> 00:20:11.526
(car door thudding)

00:20:15.834 --> 00:20:17.303
(door rattling)

00:20:17.403 --> 00:20:20.877
(footsteps thudding)

00:20:22.848 --> 00:20:24.084
(door creaking)

00:20:24.184 --> 00:20:28.325
(Komatsu breathing heavily)

00:20:29.027 --> 00:20:32.366
(melancholy music)

00:20:35.907 --> 00:20:37.745
I ran up the seven
flights of stairs

00:20:37.845 --> 00:20:40.349
as fast as I could,
and I opened the door.

00:20:40.449 --> 00:20:42.855
Even though the bed and
futons had been delivered,

00:20:42.955 --> 00:20:44.692
Nana was sleeping on the floor.

00:20:44.792 --> 00:20:48.198
She was curled up in a
blanket beside the heater.

00:20:52.173 --> 00:20:53.041
Hey, Nana?

00:20:53.142 --> 00:20:56.148
You gave off this impression
of being like a stray cat

00:20:56.248 --> 00:20:58.853
going through life free
and full of pride,

00:20:58.953 --> 00:21:01.659
but I could see the
wound in your heart.

00:21:01.759 --> 00:21:03.563
At the time, I didn't
really think about it.

00:21:03.663 --> 00:21:06.903
I just thought it was
another cool thing about you.

00:21:07.003 --> 00:21:11.244
I never realized how deep
the hurt lay inside you.
