00:00:02.941 --> 00:00:04.744
- [Nana] I realized the way she
talked was

00:00:04.845 --> 00:00:06.380
like the way she sang.

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:08.519
Her rhythm wasn't much different

00:00:08.619 --> 00:00:10.222
than that annoying thing Takumi
does,

00:00:10.322 --> 00:00:13.863
when he stretches out the
last word in his monologues.

00:00:13.963 --> 00:00:15.666
They sounded the same.

00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:18.171
Just like how I started to sound
like Ren,

00:00:18.271 --> 00:00:19.741
before I even knew it.

00:01:58.806 --> 00:02:01.645
(piano melody)

00:02:02.212 --> 00:02:03.181
- You liar.

00:02:03.281 --> 00:02:06.120
(giggling)

00:02:07.757 --> 00:02:11.063
- [Nana] Are those two
getting it on?

00:02:11.163 --> 00:02:12.734
Considering how much Takumi gets
around,

00:02:12.834 --> 00:02:16.073
I wouldn't be surprised if
stuff was going on between them.

00:02:16.173 --> 00:02:17.376
But if he's messing around with
Reira,

00:02:17.476 --> 00:02:19.346
while Hachi waits at home,
cooking,

00:02:19.446 --> 00:02:21.317
that's just messed up.

00:02:23.622 --> 00:02:24.691
Damn.

00:02:24.791 --> 00:02:28.131
I feel that scab on my
heart peeling off again.

00:02:29.668 --> 00:02:32.205
I thought those miserable
days were over,

00:02:32.306 --> 00:02:36.013
when I think of nothing
but Hachi 24-7,

00:02:36.113 --> 00:02:36.648
but it all rushes back to me,

00:02:36.748 --> 00:02:40.756
whenever I see Takumi's
smug, arrogant face.

00:02:40.856 --> 00:02:42.527
I was such a wimp.

00:02:42.627 --> 00:02:43.962
I just gave up.

00:02:44.063 --> 00:02:47.704
Right when Hachi was feeling
the most helpless in her life,

00:02:48.973 --> 00:02:50.876
I made things worse for her.

00:02:52.613 --> 00:02:53.816
- [Female Interviewer] The
interview

00:02:53.916 --> 00:02:54.283
will last about three minutes.

00:02:54.383 --> 00:02:55.485
Please start by introducing
yourself,

00:02:55.586 --> 00:02:56.888
and the other band members.

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:57.489
- Okay.

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:58.892
- After that, we'll ask a few
things

00:02:58.993 --> 00:03:00.228
about your future plans.

00:03:00.328 --> 00:03:01.297
All those questions are the same

00:03:01.397 --> 00:03:02.734
as what we went over with you
earlier.

00:03:02.834 --> 00:03:05.205
- Yeah, thank you.
I think I got it.

00:03:05.305 --> 00:03:06.173
- Hey, could you do me a favor,

00:03:06.273 --> 00:03:07.476
and ask her what
she thinks of me?

00:03:07.577 --> 00:03:09.179
I'd really like
to know the truth.

00:03:09.279 --> 00:03:10.081
(grunting)

00:03:10.181 --> 00:03:10.816
- Yes!
- Yes!

00:03:10.916 --> 00:03:12.152
We'd definitely like to
discuss that with you.

00:03:12.252 --> 00:03:13.889
- What the hell, you're
harmonizing?

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:14.924
(laughing)

00:03:15.025 --> 00:03:18.231
- Nana, you can't talk
back to the VJs like that.

00:03:18.331 --> 00:03:18.966
And when you're on the air,

00:03:19.066 --> 00:03:21.437
please don't say too much,
you know, just be cool.

00:03:21.538 --> 00:03:25.145
- Whatever. It's not my fault,
Ren said something stupid.

00:03:25.245 --> 00:03:26.648
- Aren't you gonna
eat something Nobu?

00:03:26.748 --> 00:03:29.019
- I don't know how you can
eat right before the show.

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:30.890
- Oh, are you nervous Nobu?

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.725
That's so cute.

00:03:31.825 --> 00:03:33.829
- Leave me alone.

00:03:33.929 --> 00:03:35.900
- [Nana] I was nervous too.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.568
Anybody would be,

00:03:36.668 --> 00:03:38.806
if it was their first
time on a TV show

00:03:38.906 --> 00:03:40.041
with a live audience.

00:03:40.141 --> 00:03:42.045
- [Cameraman] Okay, people
30 seconds until the open.

00:03:42.145 --> 00:03:42.780
- [Nana] I couldn't stop
thinking

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.655
about all those people
sitting at home, watching me.

00:03:46.755 --> 00:03:48.057
It was scary.

00:03:48.157 --> 00:03:49.594
- [Cameraman] 20 seconds.

00:03:49.694 --> 00:03:51.932
- [Nana] So I closed my eyes,

00:03:52.032 --> 00:03:54.069
and imagined her.

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:57.042
Hachi, watching over me,
in her room,

00:03:57.142 --> 00:03:58.879
before it was empty.

00:03:59.647 --> 00:04:01.685
- [Cameraman] 10 seconds.

00:04:01.785 --> 00:04:02.887
Eight, seven.

00:04:02.987 --> 00:04:05.693
- [Nana] It was my own little
trick to get rid of my anxiety

00:04:05.793 --> 00:04:09.400
but she must have thrown that
old TV out a long time ago.

00:04:09.501 --> 00:04:13.642
- Coming up next is Music
Studio, and it's live.

00:04:13.742 --> 00:04:14.109
- That was her,

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:16.548
she looked right into the
camera and totally smiled at me.

00:04:16.648 --> 00:04:17.482
Did you see her Jun? Did you?

00:04:17.583 --> 00:04:18.719
- Well, I wouldn't exactly say

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:21.290
she was smiling at you
specifically...

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.796
And you're totally
blocking the TV.

00:04:23.896 --> 00:04:25.733
- Oh.

00:04:25.833 --> 00:04:27.369
- Have you forgotten that your
own husband

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:29.039
is on this show too?

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:30.776
- I don't care about Takumi.

00:04:30.876 --> 00:04:31.611
I see him all the time.

00:04:31.711 --> 00:04:33.147
Sometimes too much of him.

00:04:33.247 --> 00:04:34.517
- So you're already sick of him.

00:04:34.617 --> 00:04:37.222
- It's not that it's just,
he's such a different person

00:04:37.322 --> 00:04:38.559
when he is on these
sorts of shows.

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:39.493
It's kind of embarrassing,

00:04:39.594 --> 00:04:41.063
'cause I feel like I don't
even know him.

00:04:41.163 --> 00:04:43.602
- First you were a big
fan of that rock star persona,

00:04:43.702 --> 00:04:45.906
and now you talk about
him like he's family.

00:04:46.006 --> 00:04:47.409
- Well, yeah, obviously.

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:48.478
I mean after all Takumi

00:04:48.579 --> 00:04:50.616
is the closest person I
have in my life right now.

00:04:50.716 --> 00:04:54.056
- In a similar way, Blast has
been like your family too.

00:04:54.156 --> 00:04:55.225
But you still get all crazy,

00:04:55.325 --> 00:04:56.995
and start screaming like
a die hard fan,

00:04:57.095 --> 00:04:58.331
whenever you see the guru.

00:04:58.431 --> 00:05:00.870
It's so annoying.

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.542
- That's 'cause I can only
watch Nana from a distance.

00:05:03.642 --> 00:05:05.846
There's nothing I can
do but worry about her,

00:05:05.946 --> 00:05:06.548
and cheer her on.

00:05:06.648 --> 00:05:09.219
I guess that's a lot
like being a fan,

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:10.823
but it really makes me sad.

00:05:10.923 --> 00:05:12.827
- Well, I'm sure she's
been pretty busy lately.

00:05:12.927 --> 00:05:17.068
So I doubt she has the time
to be looking after you.

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:20.776
- I know, but I don't
need her to look after me.

00:05:20.876 --> 00:05:24.016
I'm just sad 'cause she
doesn't have to depend on me.

00:05:25.318 --> 00:05:27.122
- [Nana] The countdown started.

00:05:27.222 --> 00:05:29.159
We're about to go live.

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:30.563
I gotta act cool and calm,

00:05:30.663 --> 00:05:33.234
to let Hachi know she
doesn't need to worry.

00:05:33.334 --> 00:05:34.436
- Good evening, I'm your host,

00:05:34.537 --> 00:05:35.271
Chie Takahashi.

00:05:35.371 --> 00:05:36.440
- And I'm Tsuyoshi Morishita.

00:05:36.541 --> 00:05:38.377
- Hey see that host
with big tits?

00:05:38.478 --> 00:05:40.148
She's having an affair
with the other guy.

00:05:40.248 --> 00:05:41.852
Her boobs have got
to be implants.

00:05:41.952 --> 00:05:42.787
- [Chie] For the first
time ever,

00:05:42.887 --> 00:05:44.022
these two superstar
bands...

00:05:44.122 --> 00:05:44.624
- Are you watching it in here?

00:05:44.724 --> 00:05:46.995
You have a TV in your
room, don't you?

00:05:47.095 --> 00:05:49.868
- Yeah, but I wanna see
Blast on the big screen,

00:05:49.968 --> 00:05:51.070
and Nobu.

00:05:51.972 --> 00:05:52.105
(sighs)

00:05:52.205 --> 00:05:53.441
- [Tsuyoshi] For the first
time ever on Music Studio,

00:05:53.542 --> 00:05:54.476
The Black Stones.

00:05:54.577 --> 00:05:56.447
- Yeah. Nobu, play for me!

00:05:58.017 --> 00:05:58.384
- Is that him?

00:05:58.484 --> 00:06:00.723
- Nobu's like the coolest
guy ever.

00:06:00.823 --> 00:06:02.927
- Really? Isn't he
just the normal one in the band?

00:06:03.027 --> 00:06:05.766
- Usually the guys I see
are all tough and macho,

00:06:05.866 --> 00:06:08.371
so a guy who's pure and
wholesome like Nobu,

00:06:08.471 --> 00:06:10.041
can really turn me on.

00:06:10.141 --> 00:06:13.080
- Don't pervert him into another
one of your bad boys, okay.

00:06:13.181 --> 00:06:14.817
- Well look who's talking?

00:06:14.918 --> 00:06:15.920
You've done it with him.

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.122
How was he?

00:06:17.222 --> 00:06:19.493
- I haven't done
anything with him.

00:06:22.767 --> 00:06:24.369
- But you two are always
hanging around together,

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:25.673
like you're really close.

00:06:25.773 --> 00:06:27.142
- It's not what you think it is.

00:06:27.242 --> 00:06:29.079
I bet you didn't know
he's only 20.

00:06:29.179 --> 00:06:29.714
- Huh?

00:06:29.814 --> 00:06:31.217
- He's way too young for me.

00:06:31.317 --> 00:06:31.885
He's still just a kid.

00:06:31.985 --> 00:06:33.922
- So, he's only two years
younger than me.

00:06:34.022 --> 00:06:35.826
I thought he was much
younger than that.

00:06:35.926 --> 00:06:37.395
This could work.

00:06:37.495 --> 00:06:38.765
- [Nana] Once the show started,

00:06:38.865 --> 00:06:41.003
Ren went all cool and mature.

00:06:43.241 --> 00:06:44.142
- [Male Interviewer] Word has
it,

00:06:44.243 --> 00:06:44.978
that you guys are getting ready

00:06:45.078 --> 00:06:45.980
to release your first single?

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:46.848
- Pretty much.

00:06:46.948 --> 00:06:48.184
- [Male Interviewer] And
when will it be on sale?

00:06:48.284 --> 00:06:52.158
- [Nana] Of course he can cut
me off saying anything stupid.

00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:56.300
He can switch so easily into
the role of Trapnest Ren.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.204
It's better than if he acted
like a clown,

00:06:58.304 --> 00:07:01.043
but it's still weird
and robotic.

00:07:01.143 --> 00:07:04.082
- All right, it's time to hear
some music.

00:07:04.182 --> 00:07:05.786
- First up, The Black Stones.

00:07:05.886 --> 00:07:07.990
(squealing)

00:07:10.696 --> 00:07:13.602
- [Nana] I wanna smash
it to pieces.

00:07:14.469 --> 00:07:16.440
Anything.

00:07:16.541 --> 00:07:18.244
Everything.

00:07:18.344 --> 00:07:21.350
Trapnest's fake expressions.

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:24.423
The VJs painted on smiles.

00:07:24.524 --> 00:07:27.630
The diplomatic questions
prepared ahead of time.

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:30.401
It's like we're monkeys
dancing for the crowd.

00:07:30.502 --> 00:07:32.439
What a lame ass show.

00:07:34.443 --> 00:07:36.681
But, I'm a part of it.

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:38.752
I'm getting paid
to play the part

00:07:38.852 --> 00:07:42.192
of a media creation
known as Nana from Blast.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:43.629
I guess in this world

00:07:43.729 --> 00:07:47.102
you can't do what you want,
and expect to get paid for it.

00:07:49.006 --> 00:07:51.645
My life has always
been a B movie.

00:07:54.216 --> 00:07:58.625
- Go ahead, make whatever you
want out of my sordid past,

00:07:58.725 --> 00:08:01.798
spread all sorts of rumors.

00:08:03.401 --> 00:08:04.637
But...

00:08:06.307 --> 00:08:08.612
I have to write my own script.

00:08:08.712 --> 00:08:12.385
It's up to me to give it a
bright future.

00:08:12.485 --> 00:08:16.561
I'm no longer that helpless
girl, who was left behind.

00:08:16.661 --> 00:08:20.068
(melancholic music)

00:08:21.705 --> 00:08:23.875
- Marry me.

00:08:23.976 --> 00:08:25.713
- [Nana] We never talked
about a formal thing

00:08:25.813 --> 00:08:28.084
like marriage before.

00:08:28.184 --> 00:08:29.921
It wasn't even an issue.

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:33.194
But if we wanna keep playing our
parts,

00:08:33.294 --> 00:08:34.831
and be together,

00:08:34.931 --> 00:08:36.801
that is one way to do it.

00:08:38.404 --> 00:08:42.112
Proposing to me was Ren's way
of trying to be responsible.

00:08:43.782 --> 00:08:46.420
We'll make an announcement
to the public.

00:08:46.521 --> 00:08:47.422
We really love each other,

00:08:47.523 --> 00:08:50.461
and we're getting
married to prove it.

00:08:50.562 --> 00:08:54.871
Some of the die hard fans
will freak out and get mad,

00:08:54.971 --> 00:08:56.508
but most people will accept it

00:08:56.608 --> 00:08:59.012
as a love story with
a happy ending.

00:09:01.685 --> 00:09:04.891
Everything has turned into
a show now, hasn't it?

00:09:07.228 --> 00:09:08.832
But I'm alright with that.

00:09:08.932 --> 00:09:11.738
The truth is, I couldn't
live another day

00:09:11.838 --> 00:09:13.842
without being able to see Ren.

00:09:16.781 --> 00:09:18.719
- And now it's time to introduce
tonight's final guests.

00:09:18.819 --> 00:09:20.254
- It's been a while since
their last appearance,

00:09:20.354 --> 00:09:21.090
but here they are.

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:22.125
Trapnest.

00:09:22.225 --> 00:09:23.494
- Yeah, Takumi.

00:09:23.595 --> 00:09:25.498
- Your new song, Shadow of Love,

00:09:25.599 --> 00:09:27.570
delves into the theme
of trust between lovers,

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:28.437
is that right?

00:09:28.538 --> 00:09:28.972
- [Reira] Yes.

00:09:29.072 --> 00:09:31.811
- I'm fortunate enough to
have already heard this song.

00:09:31.911 --> 00:09:34.751
How do you consistently come
up with such heartfelt lyrics?

00:09:34.851 --> 00:09:37.556
- Heartfelt? I mean
Trapnest's music is good,

00:09:37.656 --> 00:09:39.894
but the lyrics are
pretty contrived.

00:09:39.994 --> 00:09:41.463
- When I first listen
to the music,

00:09:41.564 --> 00:09:43.702
all kinds of images just
pop into my head,

00:09:43.802 --> 00:09:46.708
and then the words start
pouring out, one after another.

00:09:46.808 --> 00:09:49.079
It's almost as if the
songs write themselves.

00:09:49.179 --> 00:09:50.047
- [Chie] That's amazing.

00:09:50.148 --> 00:09:52.385
- I can't do it.

00:09:52.485 --> 00:09:52.953
- [Tsuyoshi] When we come back,

00:09:53.053 --> 00:09:54.824
we'll hear Shadow of Love.

00:09:54.924 --> 00:09:55.726
- What's up with that?

00:09:55.826 --> 00:09:57.061
Takumi didn't even get to talk.

00:09:57.162 --> 00:09:59.266
I wanted to see him get
all high and mighty,

00:09:59.366 --> 00:10:01.069
that's too bad.

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:03.875
- [Nana] Up till then, I was
so blown away by Reira's voice,

00:10:03.975 --> 00:10:06.981
I never really paid
attention to her lyrics,

00:10:07.082 --> 00:10:08.852
but after she explained
how she wrote them

00:10:08.952 --> 00:10:10.789
with some kind of divine
intervention,

00:10:10.889 --> 00:10:13.595
I decided to really listen.

00:10:13.695 --> 00:10:17.970
But it was just another
song about an affair.

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:22.078
My suspicion of Takumi and Reira
grew stronger and stronger.

00:10:22.178 --> 00:10:27.155
After the broadcast I grabbed
Ren, and interrogated him.

00:10:27.255 --> 00:10:29.560
- No way. It just isn't
possible.

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:31.063
- What do you mean? How can you
be sure?

00:10:31.163 --> 00:10:34.402
- Don't know. But Takumi
told me nothing's going on,

00:10:34.504 --> 00:10:36.775
and he's one of those guys
who stands by his word.

00:10:36.875 --> 00:10:38.444
- You expect me to believe what
he said?

00:10:38.545 --> 00:10:40.014
- There's nothing to
worry about.

00:10:40.114 --> 00:10:41.851
I've gotta get changed
and head out now.

00:10:41.951 --> 00:10:43.855
So if you want to talk about
this more,

00:10:43.955 --> 00:10:45.626
let's cover it next time.

00:10:45.726 --> 00:10:47.930
- And when will next time be?

00:10:53.374 --> 00:10:53.809
- Who knows?

00:10:53.909 --> 00:10:57.015
- But before you were all
about wanting to get married?

00:10:58.718 --> 00:11:00.188
- Then, you'll marry me?

00:11:07.068 --> 00:11:09.272
- I'll have to discuss
it with the agency first.

00:11:09.372 --> 00:11:12.813
You can't just do whatever
you want either, can you.

00:11:16.386 --> 00:11:16.955
- [Nana] Why is it

00:11:17.055 --> 00:11:18.892
that we need to get
someone else's consent,

00:11:18.992 --> 00:11:21.831
and a piece of paper to love
each other?

00:11:23.267 --> 00:11:26.006
This world can be such
a pain in the ass.

00:11:32.553 --> 00:11:33.788
- They had the two hottest
bands,

00:11:33.889 --> 00:11:35.993
that everyone's been gossiping
about in the same room,

00:11:36.093 --> 00:11:37.462
but they didn't bring it
up once.

00:11:37.563 --> 00:11:38.130
That was boring.

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:41.203
It's not like it was one of
those tabloid talk shows.

00:11:41.303 --> 00:11:43.742
I wonder if Blast's gonna be
coming back later tonight?

00:11:43.842 --> 00:11:45.979
Well, of course I really mean
Nobu.

00:11:46.079 --> 00:11:48.350
- He did say that this show
was all they had today.

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:49.319
- Really? When they get back,

00:11:49.419 --> 00:11:51.624
we should totally invite
them to play Mahjong.

00:11:51.724 --> 00:11:52.358
- Mahjong?

00:11:52.458 --> 00:11:54.162
- I guess they're all
complete Mahjong freaks.

00:11:54.262 --> 00:11:56.568
I read it in a
magazine interview.

00:11:56.668 --> 00:11:58.204
- I love Mahjong.

00:11:58.304 --> 00:12:00.474
- Hmm. That'd be fun,

00:12:00.576 --> 00:12:02.278
but it's obvious what
you're after.

00:12:02.378 --> 00:12:04.015
- Well, I'm not gonna take
a backseat,

00:12:04.115 --> 00:12:07.723
to some closet pervert who
secretly videotapes everything.

00:12:07.823 --> 00:12:11.764
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:12:11.864 --> 00:12:13.635
- [Nana] They'll say no for
sure.

00:12:13.735 --> 00:12:15.706
It's easy to say I'll go
and talk to the agency,

00:12:15.806 --> 00:12:17.610
but the president is scary.

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:20.682
And there's no way I can
convince, Ginpei either.

00:12:20.782 --> 00:12:24.256
- Nana, we've got our
advance from Gaia today.

00:12:24.356 --> 00:12:25.057
Get a cell phone.

00:12:25.157 --> 00:12:28.899
That way you can text message
Ren every once in a while.

00:12:28.999 --> 00:12:30.869
- [Nana] But if I talk
this over with Yasu,

00:12:30.969 --> 00:12:32.673
I know he'll help me out.

00:12:32.773 --> 00:12:36.514
I can do anything with Yasu
by my side.

00:12:36.614 --> 00:12:38.818
- Seriously, Nana, you
need a cell phone for work,

00:12:38.919 --> 00:12:39.754
so get one.

00:12:39.854 --> 00:12:41.858
Why are you so against them
anyway?

00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:42.927
- What's the big deal.

00:12:43.027 --> 00:12:45.464
I'm sure it'll be harder
for Ren to wait for messages

00:12:45.565 --> 00:12:47.335
that only come sporadically.

00:12:47.435 --> 00:12:50.474
When you own a cell phone,
you just get whipped around.

00:12:50.576 --> 00:12:51.811
(gasping)

00:12:51.911 --> 00:12:53.748
- Whipped by who?

00:12:53.848 --> 00:12:56.554
Hachi, or that girl next door?

00:12:56.654 --> 00:12:57.723
You're the social one,

00:12:57.823 --> 00:13:00.596
so you better not start
hating cell phones too.

00:13:00.696 --> 00:13:02.131
I won't bug you anymore.

00:13:02.231 --> 00:13:06.774
Please just find someone
to be happy with, soon.

00:13:06.874 --> 00:13:09.012
- [Hachi] Nana looked
kind of depressed to me.

00:13:09.112 --> 00:13:11.216
- Really? I thought she
looked like she was relaxed.

00:13:11.316 --> 00:13:12.953
- Yeah, but whenever she wasn't
talking,

00:13:13.053 --> 00:13:14.189
she looked out of it.

00:13:14.289 --> 00:13:16.493
- Whoa, you really are
observant.

00:13:16.594 --> 00:13:17.529
I was more concerned for Nobu.

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:20.434
He didn't even smile once
during the whole show,

00:13:20.535 --> 00:13:20.969
but who could blame him?

00:13:21.069 --> 00:13:23.808
I mean, he was stuck
on a show with Takumi.

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:27.382
- I got a text message
from Nobu the other day.

00:13:27.482 --> 00:13:28.417
- What? You did?

00:13:28.518 --> 00:13:31.691
- He wanted to get together
and talk to me one last time.

00:13:31.791 --> 00:13:35.197
I broke up with him without
even telling him why I did it.

00:13:35.298 --> 00:13:37.035
But I didn't know
what to say to him,

00:13:37.135 --> 00:13:38.170
and that was a whole month ago,

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:40.676
it'd just be weird if
I replied to him now.

00:13:40.776 --> 00:13:44.517
- You mean you never explained
the whole situation to him?

00:13:44.617 --> 00:13:45.886
I should have figured as much,

00:13:45.986 --> 00:13:48.190
but it's probably best you
didn't reply.

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:51.731
It'd be worse if you were
subconsciously leading him on.

00:13:51.831 --> 00:13:53.033
But after ignoring him
for this long,

00:13:53.133 --> 00:13:55.806
he'd have to give up
and move on.

00:13:57.509 --> 00:13:58.678
- But the truth is, Jun,

00:13:58.778 --> 00:13:59.981
even now my heart aches,

00:14:00.081 --> 00:14:02.185
whenever I think about Shoji.

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:03.354
- Hold on,

00:14:03.454 --> 00:14:05.892
why did you suddenly change
the subject to Shoji?

00:14:05.993 --> 00:14:07.596
- Because, now that I think back

00:14:07.696 --> 00:14:10.401
to when he started seeing
that other girl,

00:14:10.502 --> 00:14:13.908
and what made him cheat
on me in the first place,

00:14:14.009 --> 00:14:17.382
I just wish I knew why things
ended the way they did.

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:21.056
- What difference does it
make now?

00:14:21.156 --> 00:14:22.893
- It's not like I want
anything from him.

00:14:22.993 --> 00:14:23.394
It's just that,

00:14:23.494 --> 00:14:25.398
because I still don't
know what really happened.

00:14:25.498 --> 00:14:27.402
All those happy times
I spent with him,

00:14:27.503 --> 00:14:29.807
have become nothing but
painful memories.

00:14:29.907 --> 00:14:33.047
I don't know what's real,
and what's a lie anymore.

00:14:33.147 --> 00:14:35.017
I can't just take away
the pain I feel

00:14:35.117 --> 00:14:38.490
from being betrayed by
someone I really trusted.

00:14:39.794 --> 00:14:40.862
I'm worried that maybe Nobu

00:14:40.962 --> 00:14:42.966
is carrying sad feelings
around with him too,

00:14:43.067 --> 00:14:44.202
just like me.

00:14:44.302 --> 00:14:45.872
Even if he has already moved on

00:14:45.972 --> 00:14:47.743
and found another girlfriend.

00:14:47.843 --> 00:14:49.947
And I'm sure now that both
their bands are doing well,

00:14:50.047 --> 00:14:52.218
he'll probably be running
into Takumi a lot.

00:14:52.318 --> 00:14:53.988
If I could just meet up with
him,

00:14:54.089 --> 00:14:55.859
I could tell him that
I really did love him.

00:14:55.959 --> 00:14:57.963
Even though I chose Takumi in
the end.

00:14:58.063 --> 00:14:59.199
At least then our relationship

00:14:59.299 --> 00:15:01.369
might have some sense
of closure to it.

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:04.510
And there wouldn't be
any more bad feelings.

00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:06.948
But maybe that would
only make me feel better?

00:15:07.048 --> 00:15:08.985
Maybe I'd only be hurting
him more?

00:15:09.085 --> 00:15:11.289
What do you think
I should do, Jun?

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:14.964
- That's a complicated question,
if I've ever heard one.

00:15:15.064 --> 00:15:17.435
- I told her to do what
she felt was right,

00:15:17.536 --> 00:15:19.072
but I'm kind of worried.

00:15:19.172 --> 00:15:19.940
- Come to think of it,

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.345
Shoji did wanna explain
things to her, remember?

00:15:22.445 --> 00:15:23.882
Maybe we shouldn't have stopped
him?

00:15:23.982 --> 00:15:24.683
- Yeah, maybe.

00:15:24.784 --> 00:15:25.819
I know that everyone's
different,

00:15:25.919 --> 00:15:27.288
and there aren't really any
right answers.

00:15:27.388 --> 00:15:31.263
I just tend to go off about
things like I know everything.

00:15:31.363 --> 00:15:35.137
I'm partly responsible for this
mess, and that really sucks.

00:15:35.237 --> 00:15:37.308
From now on, I'll never
give another piece of advice

00:15:37.408 --> 00:15:39.212
to anyone about their
relationships.

00:15:39.312 --> 00:15:41.283
I don't wanna turn into
some nosy old lady.

00:15:41.383 --> 00:15:44.289
- Well, you already have
been acting like an old lady.

00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:45.124
- Maybe 'cause I've been hanging
around

00:15:45.224 --> 00:15:47.061
with an old man too much.

00:15:47.161 --> 00:15:49.567
- Hey Kyosuke and Junko, you're
here!

00:15:49.667 --> 00:15:52.004
- That makes it sound like
they're a superhero couple.

00:15:52.105 --> 00:15:53.440
- Well well, speak of the devil.

00:15:53.541 --> 00:15:55.177
- Were you two talking smack
again?

00:15:55.277 --> 00:15:58.283
- I hardly ever see you
hanging out here Sachiko.

00:15:58.383 --> 00:15:59.352
- True. But I just got paid,

00:15:59.452 --> 00:16:01.791
so I figured why not treat
myself to a night out.

00:16:01.891 --> 00:16:02.358
- Shoji?

00:16:02.458 --> 00:16:03.293
How dare you go around blowing
money

00:16:03.393 --> 00:16:05.866
when Sachiko has a penny pinch
to get by,

00:16:05.966 --> 00:16:08.103
and you changed your
hair again, fancy pants.

00:16:08.203 --> 00:16:09.205
How much did that cost?

00:16:09.305 --> 00:16:11.944
- Actually, I'm the one who
took him to the stylist.

00:16:12.044 --> 00:16:12.880
I'm sorry.

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:13.715
- You shouldn't listen

00:16:13.815 --> 00:16:16.521
to what that nosy old lady has
to say.

00:16:16.621 --> 00:16:16.888
- [Shoji] So anyway,

00:16:16.988 --> 00:16:19.125
did you guys hear they're
having the fireworks festival

00:16:19.225 --> 00:16:20.294
by the river tomorrow night?

00:16:20.394 --> 00:16:22.231
- What? Fireworks, at this time
of year?

00:16:22.331 --> 00:16:23.433
- Remember how they were
canceled

00:16:23.535 --> 00:16:26.339
'cause of that huge typhoon
we had earlier in the summer?

00:16:26.439 --> 00:16:26.641
- Yeah.

00:16:26.741 --> 00:16:28.778
- Well, a lot of people must
have complained about that,

00:16:28.878 --> 00:16:30.414
so they decided to have it now.

00:16:30.515 --> 00:16:31.049
- Hm.

00:16:31.149 --> 00:16:33.220
- The fireworks start at 6:15
sharp.

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:36.259
If you're free, what do you
say the four of us go together?

00:16:36.359 --> 00:16:37.696
- Oh, sorry, I have to work.

00:16:37.796 --> 00:16:38.297
- So do I.

00:16:38.397 --> 00:16:40.334
- Cool. Then we'll actually
be able to enjoy ourselves.

00:16:40.434 --> 00:16:41.838
- But I'm sure Nana's free.

00:16:41.938 --> 00:16:42.739
She might wanna go.

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:43.608
- Ugh!

00:16:43.708 --> 00:16:44.075
Don't tell her.

00:16:44.175 --> 00:16:45.879
What if we accidentally bump
into her?

00:16:45.979 --> 00:16:47.482
- Oh yeah, so what if you do?

00:16:47.583 --> 00:16:50.522
You're both adults,
who deal with it.

00:16:50.622 --> 00:16:52.191
(keypad beeping)

00:16:56.066 --> 00:17:00.274
Non. Jun Chan Ryan Pei Kou.

00:17:00.374 --> 00:17:03.013
- No way, how come
you're so good, Miu?

00:17:03.113 --> 00:17:04.817
It's not fair.

00:17:04.917 --> 00:17:05.484
- I don't know.

00:17:05.585 --> 00:17:08.090
Maybe 'cause I played a
mysterious invincible woman

00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:10.160
in a Mahjong movie the
other day.

00:17:10.261 --> 00:17:11.363
- Oh, so you do stuff like that

00:17:11.463 --> 00:17:13.500
to get into the various roles
you play.

00:17:13.601 --> 00:17:14.703
That is so cool.

00:17:14.803 --> 00:17:15.639
- Yeah, well in my next video,

00:17:15.739 --> 00:17:18.978
I star as the nurse in an
all boys boarding school.

00:17:19.078 --> 00:17:21.082
Wanna help me rehearse now, boo?

00:17:21.183 --> 00:17:22.553
- School nurse?

00:17:22.653 --> 00:17:23.688
- This sucks.

00:17:23.788 --> 00:17:24.857
- Hey, don't leave the table

00:17:24.957 --> 00:17:25.992
just 'cause you're not winning.

00:17:26.092 --> 00:17:27.061
What are you, a baby?

00:17:27.161 --> 00:17:28.363
- Yeah. Yeah, whatever.

00:17:28.463 --> 00:17:30.267
You must avenge me, Yasu.

00:17:30.367 --> 00:17:31.436
- Aren't you gonna play, Nana?

00:17:31.537 --> 00:17:32.238
- Maybe a little later.
- Does Yasu always sleep

00:17:32.338 --> 00:17:34.209
in that little crop top?
- I'm at a good part right now

00:17:34.309 --> 00:17:34.643
- Or does he starch it himself?

00:17:34.743 --> 00:17:35.879
- I'm not sure what Nobu's
thinking,

00:17:35.979 --> 00:17:37.950
but Yuri's practically
stripping naked,

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:40.187
and jumping on top of
him right now.

00:17:40.287 --> 00:17:41.089
Gotta stay out of it.

00:17:41.189 --> 00:17:43.026
Just keep to myself.

00:17:46.867 --> 00:17:48.136
(gasps)

00:17:49.707 --> 00:17:51.978
- Hey, Nobu, do you
have a girlfriend?

00:17:52.078 --> 00:17:53.882
- No, I had one, but she
dumped me.

00:17:53.982 --> 00:17:55.719
- Oh then you must be
pretty lonely.

00:17:55.819 --> 00:17:57.054
- Yes.

00:17:57.154 --> 00:17:59.693
- Well I'd sure like
to comfort you.

00:17:59.793 --> 00:18:00.562
- Ugh.

00:18:00.662 --> 00:18:02.398
- You know Yuri,
I'm pretty lonely too.

00:18:02.498 --> 00:18:04.068
- What the hell are
you saying, baldy?

00:18:04.168 --> 00:18:05.672
- Hey, I was just kidding.

00:18:05.772 --> 00:18:06.674
- How about at threesome?

00:18:06.774 --> 00:18:09.212
- No way.

00:18:09.312 --> 00:18:12.653
- Hold on, Nobuo, why are
you talking like Hachi?

00:18:12.753 --> 00:18:14.389
Uh-oh, this is bad.

00:18:14.489 --> 00:18:16.761
Yuti is starting to look
more and more like Hachi,

00:18:16.861 --> 00:18:19.533
even their hairstyles are kind
of similar.

00:18:19.633 --> 00:18:22.438
- Hey Yasu do you know what
our schedule is tomorrow?

00:18:22.539 --> 00:18:25.010
- Ginpei told us on
our way back, remember?

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:26.914
- In the morning we've
got an interview for TV.

00:18:27.014 --> 00:18:29.687
In the afternoon, there's a
photoshoot for some new posters.

00:18:29.787 --> 00:18:31.724
At six, we have a magazine
interview,

00:18:31.824 --> 00:18:34.462
and then at 10 we're on
a live radio show.

00:18:34.563 --> 00:18:35.599
- That's a rough schedule.

00:18:35.699 --> 00:18:37.836
Maybe we should let you
guys go and get some sleep.

00:18:37.936 --> 00:18:40.809
- No, I will not let you
run off with all the glory.

00:18:40.909 --> 00:18:42.311
I must avenge Shin.

00:18:42.411 --> 00:18:45.986
- That's big talk from a
man who is about to lose.

00:18:46.086 --> 00:18:47.121
- Do you think it'd be possible

00:18:47.221 --> 00:18:47.923
to cancel the interview at six?

00:18:48.023 --> 00:18:48.858
- What the hell's
wrong with you?

00:18:48.958 --> 00:18:51.062
- I mean, can we reschedule
it to another day?

00:18:51.162 --> 00:18:52.566
- No.

00:18:52.666 --> 00:18:56.707
- But Hachi just invited us
all to the fireworks festival.

00:18:56.807 --> 00:18:59.279
- Huh?

00:18:59.379 --> 00:19:01.416
- Hachi? Who's that?

00:19:08.063 --> 00:19:11.102
(piano melody)

00:19:14.142 --> 00:19:17.816
- Nobu!

00:19:17.916 --> 00:19:18.885
You'll go right?

00:19:18.985 --> 00:19:20.287
I mean, well all go.

00:19:20.387 --> 00:19:21.557
- Nana, please, calm down.

00:19:21.657 --> 00:19:23.226
- You can't. You've got work,
right?

00:19:23.327 --> 00:19:24.362
- It's a magazine interview.

00:19:24.462 --> 00:19:26.266
I'm sure they'll reschedule
if you ask them to.

00:19:26.366 --> 00:19:28.003
- But they can't go
out all together.

00:19:28.103 --> 00:19:29.138
Everyone will recognize them.

00:19:29.238 --> 00:19:30.909
They'll stick out.

00:19:31.009 --> 00:19:31.577
- That's not a problem.

00:19:31.677 --> 00:19:33.748
All they have to do is
wear disguises.

00:19:33.848 --> 00:19:35.484
- Shin, text her back right now.

00:19:35.585 --> 00:19:36.386
- Text what?

00:19:36.486 --> 00:19:38.658
- Meet us at six, in room 707.

00:19:38.758 --> 00:19:40.528
It's been almost two months
since I've been there.

00:19:40.628 --> 00:19:43.534
There won't be any
paparazzi hanging around.

00:19:47.074 --> 00:19:50.214
(phone ringtone)

00:19:56.794 --> 00:19:57.395
(crying)

00:19:57.495 --> 00:19:59.499
- [Nana] It's not a dream Hachi.

00:20:01.002 --> 00:20:04.175
We can laugh and be
together, just like before.

00:20:05.444 --> 00:20:07.381
We can start over.

00:20:07.481 --> 00:20:09.920
Please let me start over.

00:20:11.089 --> 00:20:13.226
Let's go back to that summer
day,

00:20:13.326 --> 00:20:17.368
and rewrite a bright and
happy ending to our story.

00:20:18.871 --> 00:20:21.409
(keyboard clacking)

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:23.013
- Oh, hey Takumi.

00:20:23.113 --> 00:20:24.048
- Huh?

00:20:24.148 --> 00:20:26.854
- There's something I've been
meaning to talk to you about.

00:20:26.954 --> 00:20:28.256
- Yeah. What's that?

00:20:28.356 --> 00:20:31.162
- Nana and I wanna-
- Damn it! Piece of crap!

00:20:31.262 --> 00:20:33.200
It crashed again.

00:20:34.402 --> 00:20:36.172
I'm dead tired.

00:20:36.272 --> 00:20:37.408
- Something's coming outta you.

00:20:37.509 --> 00:20:39.112
- What do you want to talk
about?

00:20:39.212 --> 00:20:40.749
And does it have to be now?

00:20:40.849 --> 00:20:43.487
Actually I think right
now is not a good time.

00:20:43.588 --> 00:20:46.025
Oh, but I do have one
quick question for you.

00:20:46.126 --> 00:20:47.261
- Which is?

00:20:47.361 --> 00:20:49.265
- What kind of ring did you get
Hachiko,

00:20:49.365 --> 00:20:50.969
and where can I buy one?

00:20:52.806 --> 00:20:57.081
- [Nana] Hey Hachi, we have
such different styles and taste,

00:20:57.181 --> 00:20:58.216
who in their wildest dreams

00:20:58.316 --> 00:20:59.419
would've imagined that one day

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:01.791
we'd both be wearing
the same symbol of love,

00:21:01.891 --> 00:21:04.162
at the same time?

00:21:04.262 --> 00:21:07.334
I know you're fickle, and crave
new things

00:21:07.435 --> 00:21:10.742
but I hope you still
treasure it, even now.

00:21:10.842 --> 00:21:14.683
That generic looking ring
from a high end jewelry store.
