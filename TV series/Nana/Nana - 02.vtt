WEBVTT

00:00:02.004 --> 00:00:03.306
- [Nana] The place
where I grew up

00:00:03.406 --> 00:00:05.477
is surrounded by mountains.

00:00:05.578 --> 00:00:09.051
It's not very big and
it's not very small.

00:00:09.151 --> 00:00:10.320
Even though it's not a big city,

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.794
it's not a tiny village way
out in the country either.

00:00:13.895 --> 00:00:17.201
There's not a lot of stuff
for tourists to do there.

00:00:17.301 --> 00:00:19.372
I'm the middle child
in our family.

00:00:19.472 --> 00:00:21.577
I was left on my own most
of the time.

00:00:21.677 --> 00:00:24.883
I come from a typical
middle class home.

00:00:24.983 --> 00:00:27.989
My life has been nothing
but average

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:29.392
and I was just about to graduate

00:00:29.492 --> 00:00:32.899
from my very average
all-girl's high school.

00:00:32.999 --> 00:00:35.705
(rock music)

00:02:06.285 --> 00:02:07.822
- [Nana] Tokyo?

00:02:09.392 --> 00:02:11.462
- [Takashi] Yeah.
I leave next week.

00:02:11.563 --> 00:02:14.302
- [Nana] And it's not
just a business trip?

00:02:16.105 --> 00:02:17.575
- A transfer.

00:02:17.676 --> 00:02:20.848
The main office made the
decision all of a sudden.

00:02:21.717 --> 00:02:22.686
What a pain...

00:02:22.786 --> 00:02:23.286
- What?

00:02:23.386 --> 00:02:23.854
This is a disaster.

00:02:23.954 --> 00:02:27.996
Hold on. Tokyo is only two
hours away by bullet train.

00:02:28.096 --> 00:02:30.601
And we only meet once in
a while anyway.

00:02:32.071 --> 00:02:32.572
- [Takashi] It's gonna be lonely

00:02:32.672 --> 00:02:35.243
not being able to see
you anymore.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.185
It's been great hanging
out with you.

00:02:39.285 --> 00:02:40.120
Thank you.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.592
(somber piano music)

00:02:42.692 --> 00:02:45.732
- Several months before
July of 1999,

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:48.403
the demon Lord of
terror sought me out

00:02:48.504 --> 00:02:50.675
and came crashing down.

00:02:54.516 --> 00:02:57.922
I already knew the relationship
didn't have a future,

00:02:59.425 --> 00:03:04.503
but for it to end so
suddenly, so coldly...

00:03:06.673 --> 00:03:09.412
There was no point in
crying about it.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.284
(Nana crying)

00:03:12.384 --> 00:03:13.821
- But you are crying.

00:03:13.921 --> 00:03:15.323
- But Jun, I can't help it.

00:03:15.424 --> 00:03:16.359
- Pull yourself together.

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.329
I told you not to get
involved in a relationship

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.033
where you were cheating
with a married man.

00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:21.069
- Cheating with a married man?

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:22.137
Sounds like a country song!

00:03:22.237 --> 00:03:23.339
- Cheating with a sugar daddy.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.145
- I never took a single cent
from Takashi and you know it!

00:03:26.245 --> 00:03:27.782
- You sure missed an
opportunity there.

00:03:27.882 --> 00:03:29.385
You should have gotten
what you could out of him

00:03:29.485 --> 00:03:30.888
'cause he got a free ride.

00:03:30.988 --> 00:03:33.026
- Jun! How can you say that?

00:03:33.126 --> 00:03:35.430
- Hmm. I'm just kidding you,
Nana.

00:03:35.531 --> 00:03:37.635
I know how much you cared
about this guy.

00:03:37.736 --> 00:03:39.840
You had a serious
thing going on.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:40.508
- Oh, Junko.

00:03:40.608 --> 00:03:41.910
- [Junko] But if you
look at it from his side,

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.750
he probably thought you were
an easy high school girl.

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.553
- Easy? What makes you
think I'm like that?

00:03:46.653 --> 00:03:48.423
- I'm just saying that's
how older guys

00:03:48.524 --> 00:03:49.960
look at us high school students.

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.561
- Takashi's not an old guy.

00:03:50.661 --> 00:03:52.431
- When you look at it from the
perspective

00:03:52.532 --> 00:03:55.404
of a high school student, any
guy who wears a suit is old.

00:03:55.505 --> 00:03:57.474
- Why does nothing ever
go right for me?

00:03:57.575 --> 00:03:58.711
Even my name brings me bad luck.

00:03:58.811 --> 00:04:00.681
"Nana" means seven and
seven is the number

00:04:00.782 --> 00:04:03.521
that appears in Nostradamus's
prophecies as a bad omen

00:04:03.621 --> 00:04:04.956
so it's no wonder I'm cursed.

00:04:05.056 --> 00:04:06.192
- Even if your name was eight,

00:04:06.292 --> 00:04:07.361
it wouldn't make any difference.

00:04:07.461 --> 00:04:09.098
He'd still be going to Tokyo.

00:04:09.198 --> 00:04:09.933
- That's it. I'm going.

00:04:10.033 --> 00:04:10.802
- Where? To Tokyo?

00:04:10.902 --> 00:04:12.471
- No, to the salon for
a new hairstyle.

00:04:12.572 --> 00:04:13.808
That way no guy will think

00:04:13.908 --> 00:04:16.045
I'm just some easy
high school girl.

00:04:16.145 --> 00:04:16.914
- But we're graduating today.

00:04:17.014 --> 00:04:19.820
So you won't look like an easy
high school girl ever again.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:20.822
- Oh, Jun! The ceremony!

00:04:20.922 --> 00:04:22.124
We're late!

00:04:22.224 --> 00:04:23.460
Oh no!

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.403
Looking back over my life
in high school,

00:04:28.504 --> 00:04:30.040
it wouldn't be an
exaggeration to say

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.446
that it started with
love and ended with love.

00:04:33.547 --> 00:04:35.016
When I came to this all-girls
school,

00:04:35.117 --> 00:04:36.653
I never thought I'd
meet any guys.

00:04:36.753 --> 00:04:39.926
But then I felt instantly
in love with Mr. Okomoto,

00:04:40.026 --> 00:04:40.862
the art teacher.

00:04:40.962 --> 00:04:42.799
I wasn't that good at drawing
or anything,

00:04:42.899 --> 00:04:44.769
but I decided to join
the art club with a girl

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.343
from my class, Junko, who
I soon became friends with.

00:04:48.443 --> 00:04:51.683
I really started to like
art a lot, but after a year,

00:04:51.783 --> 00:04:54.488
Mr. Okomoto moved to a different
school.

00:04:55.323 --> 00:04:56.860
Next, I fell for Mr. Nokomora,

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.167
the hipster who worked at the
video store near my house.

00:05:00.267 --> 00:05:04.776
When I finally got the guts to
ask him, he just blew me off.

00:05:06.145 --> 00:05:07.114
Next was Mr. Kawasaki,

00:05:07.214 --> 00:05:09.986
the cool guy who worked
with me at the restaurant.

00:05:10.086 --> 00:05:11.122
And then there was Yoshida,

00:05:11.222 --> 00:05:14.261
the baby faced pizza delivery
guy.

00:05:14.361 --> 00:05:16.265
Despite meeting all these guys,

00:05:16.365 --> 00:05:18.036
none of them ever led
to anything.

00:05:18.136 --> 00:05:21.175
I convinced myself I wasn't
attractive enough for them.

00:05:21.275 --> 00:05:22.979
So I went on a diet.

00:05:23.079 --> 00:05:25.150
I decided I would have
to start taking the time

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:29.358
to get to know the person before
falling in love with them.

00:05:29.458 --> 00:05:31.630
By that time I was going
into my senior year

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:33.934
and summer had just started.

00:05:37.107 --> 00:05:40.146
That's when I finally met him.

00:05:40.247 --> 00:05:41.415
- [Takashi] Hey, what happened?

00:05:41.517 --> 00:05:42.585
Are you all right?

00:05:42.685 --> 00:05:44.188
- [Nana] Yeah. Sorry.

00:05:44.288 --> 00:05:46.425
I'm fine.

00:05:46.527 --> 00:05:49.365
- You don't look fine.
Your face is pale.

00:05:49.465 --> 00:05:53.339
- [Nana] Takashi Asano.
29 years old.

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:54.743
At least, that's what he
told me.

00:05:54.843 --> 00:05:57.715
Who knows if that
was his real name or not.

00:05:57.815 --> 00:06:00.120
It was love at first sight.

00:06:03.092 --> 00:06:04.194
- [Takashi] A diet?

00:06:04.295 --> 00:06:07.434
- Yeah. I think that's why I
get a little dizzy sometimes.

00:06:07.535 --> 00:06:09.138
- I don't know why you
think you need to diet.

00:06:09.238 --> 00:06:10.508
You're cute just as you are.

00:06:10.608 --> 00:06:11.475
- [Nana] I'm cute?

00:06:11.577 --> 00:06:13.681
- So do you often come to
the movies by yourself?

00:06:13.781 --> 00:06:16.587
- Yeah. All the time.
I love movies.

00:06:16.687 --> 00:06:19.593
I don't know why, but I enjoy
watching them on my own.

00:06:19.693 --> 00:06:21.930
- I know. I understand.

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:22.699
Me too.

00:06:22.799 --> 00:06:25.571
- [Nana] But I wouldn't
mind going with you.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.711
- Well, I better get going.

00:06:28.811 --> 00:06:30.581
You seem to be feeling a lot
better now.

00:06:30.681 --> 00:06:32.652
- Wait, is there
anything I can do to thank you?

00:06:32.752 --> 00:06:34.488
- Don't worry. It was
my pleasure.

00:06:34.589 --> 00:06:36.259
Be careful on your
way home. Okay?

00:06:36.359 --> 00:06:37.194
It's getting late.

00:06:37.294 --> 00:06:41.503
- He's so handsome. So
kind and such a gentleman.

00:06:41.603 --> 00:06:43.106
He's perfect.

00:06:43.206 --> 00:06:45.544
Hey, I...

00:06:45.645 --> 00:06:47.749
I work part-time at a
little restaurant

00:06:47.849 --> 00:06:49.552
just around the corner
from here.

00:06:49.653 --> 00:06:52.224
If you have the chance he
should drop by sometime

00:06:52.324 --> 00:06:53.827
so I can repay you.

00:06:57.301 --> 00:07:00.206
Two weeks passed and
there was no sign of him.

00:07:00.307 --> 00:07:03.681
The more time went by, the
more I wanted to see him again.

00:07:03.781 --> 00:07:05.818
Then one day I was leaving
the restaurant

00:07:05.918 --> 00:07:10.695
at the end of my shift and
there he was waiting for me.

00:07:10.795 --> 00:07:12.030
The moment I saw him standing
there,

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:15.403
I knew I was totally
in love with him.

00:07:15.504 --> 00:07:18.109
It felt like I was being
swept away.

00:07:19.178 --> 00:07:22.719
Of course, I noticed the
wedding ring right away,

00:07:22.819 --> 00:07:25.758
but somehow I was able to
ignore it.

00:07:25.858 --> 00:07:27.595
I was really in love
with him

00:07:27.695 --> 00:07:30.635
and I truly believed
he loved me too.

00:07:30.735 --> 00:07:33.974
The only thing I knew about
him was his cell phone number.

00:07:34.074 --> 00:07:37.982
I had no idea where he
lived or where he worked.

00:07:39.552 --> 00:07:41.657
We met two or three
times a month

00:07:41.757 --> 00:07:44.228
and we always did
the same thing.

00:07:44.328 --> 00:07:45.798
We'd go for a drive.

00:07:45.898 --> 00:07:48.671
And then we'd end up in a hotel
room.

00:07:48.771 --> 00:07:52.444
We never went anywhere we
might be seen together.

00:07:53.046 --> 00:07:54.683
And like a fool,

00:07:54.783 --> 00:07:57.622
I convinced myself that
he was in love with me.

00:08:00.661 --> 00:08:02.565
If our relationship had
kept going like that,

00:08:02.665 --> 00:08:04.803
my innocence would've
faded away.

00:08:04.903 --> 00:08:06.573
Breaking up with him was
the best thing

00:08:06.673 --> 00:08:08.009
that could have happened.

00:08:08.109 --> 00:08:09.746
At least that's what I told
myself

00:08:09.846 --> 00:08:12.184
as I tried to get on
with my life.

00:08:14.756 --> 00:08:17.461
I'm starting at the local
art school in the spring

00:08:17.562 --> 00:08:18.697
and it's co-ed!

00:08:18.797 --> 00:08:20.901
So maybe in the middle of
all my studies,

00:08:21.002 --> 00:08:23.874
I'll get a chance to meet
someone special.

00:08:23.974 --> 00:08:27.749
Nana Komatsu: high school
graduate.

00:08:28.951 --> 00:08:30.053
- Please don't tell me the only
reason

00:08:30.153 --> 00:08:33.459
you're going to art school
is so you can meet guys?

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:34.629
- I can't believe you said that!

00:08:34.729 --> 00:08:36.767
I came here to study art
just like you!

00:08:36.867 --> 00:08:37.802
- Oh, that's a relief

00:08:37.902 --> 00:08:39.873
'cause no guy's gonna be
interested in you

00:08:39.973 --> 00:08:41.342
with a hairstyle like that.

00:08:41.442 --> 00:08:43.012
- You think?

00:08:43.112 --> 00:08:45.518
Anyway, I finally realized
something about myself,

00:08:45.618 --> 00:08:46.586
all these different guys?

00:08:46.686 --> 00:08:48.456
I seem to have a thing
for older men, right?

00:08:48.557 --> 00:08:50.828
- It took you this long
to figure that out?

00:08:50.928 --> 00:08:52.431
- Maybe that's why things
never worked out for me

00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:55.136
because they were older. Now
that I'm in a new school,

00:08:55.236 --> 00:08:56.472
there's lots of guys my own age.

00:08:56.573 --> 00:08:57.474
So we'll have more in common.

00:08:57.575 --> 00:08:58.911
And I might find that special
guy

00:08:59.011 --> 00:09:00.715
who could be the man
of my dreams.

00:09:00.815 --> 00:09:03.854
- She did come here to
meet guys after all.

00:09:05.223 --> 00:09:08.964
Just try not to fall in love
with the first guy you see.

00:09:10.233 --> 00:09:11.870
(romantic music)

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:13.473
- [Nana] My eyes met his.

00:09:13.574 --> 00:09:17.247
The boy with such
beautiful eyes.

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:20.220
What?

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.257
Why is he coming over here?

00:09:23.359 --> 00:09:26.065
- Junko! You are Junko right?

00:09:26.165 --> 00:09:27.502
- Is that you, Shoji?

00:09:27.602 --> 00:09:29.204
- That's right! It's Me!
Shoji Endo.

00:09:29.304 --> 00:09:32.545
- [Junko] Your hair's
so different.
I didn't recognize you.

00:09:32.645 --> 00:09:34.248
- It's been a long time.
Must have been what?

00:09:34.348 --> 00:09:36.720
Three years since we were
in junior high together?

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:37.922
- Ah, please don't tell me

00:09:38.022 --> 00:09:39.592
you've signed up for
this class too.

00:09:39.692 --> 00:09:41.095
What a disaster.

00:09:41.195 --> 00:09:43.700
I don't know if I can deal
with two loud mouths at once.

00:09:43.801 --> 00:09:45.270
One's bad enough.

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:47.207
- Oh, you mean your friend?

00:09:47.307 --> 00:09:48.443
She's a loud mouth?

00:09:48.544 --> 00:09:49.378
- Uh-huh.

00:09:49.478 --> 00:09:50.648
She's my sidekick from high
school

00:09:50.748 --> 00:09:52.952
and I have to say she's
a big loud mouth.

00:09:53.052 --> 00:09:54.254
- Really? What's your name?

00:09:54.354 --> 00:09:57.427
- I'm Nana Komatsu.
It's nice to meet you.

00:09:57.528 --> 00:09:59.264
- My name's Shoji Endo.

00:09:59.364 --> 00:09:59.933
It's a pleasure.

00:10:00.033 --> 00:10:01.402
- [Nana] Look at that smile.

00:10:01.503 --> 00:10:03.439
- Eh...

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:04.241
- Come sit over here.

00:10:04.341 --> 00:10:06.412
One of my friends from
high school is here too.

00:10:06.513 --> 00:10:07.548
- Hey, how's it going?

00:10:07.648 --> 00:10:09.418
I'm Kyosuke Takakura

00:10:09.519 --> 00:10:11.255
- [Nana] He's pretty hot too!

00:10:13.226 --> 00:10:16.566
Campus life is the best.
Isn't it, Junko?

00:10:16.666 --> 00:10:17.768
- What do you mean campus life?

00:10:17.869 --> 00:10:19.539
Neither of us live on campus.

00:10:19.639 --> 00:10:21.810
Besides it's not like
we're in university.

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:23.179
We go to an art school.

00:10:23.279 --> 00:10:24.716
- Oh yeah. I'm sorry.

00:10:24.816 --> 00:10:25.985
Don't worry about me Jun.

00:10:26.085 --> 00:10:28.422
I know Shoji is your
ace in the hole.

00:10:28.524 --> 00:10:30.493
I promise I won't stand
in your way.

00:10:30.594 --> 00:10:31.930
- My ace in the hole?

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:34.602
You don't know what you're
talking about. Do you?

00:10:34.702 --> 00:10:36.005
I thought you weren't
gonna throw yourself

00:10:36.105 --> 00:10:37.742
at the first guy who
came along Nana.

00:10:37.842 --> 00:10:40.413
And anyway, you should
know that Shoji and I

00:10:40.514 --> 00:10:41.750
are nothing more than friends.

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:42.819
- You liar!

00:10:42.919 --> 00:10:44.789
I can't believe that if
there's a good looking guy

00:10:44.889 --> 00:10:45.658
in the same class,

00:10:45.758 --> 00:10:47.227
you wouldn't have some
sort of crush on him.

00:10:47.327 --> 00:10:49.666
- Not everyone thinks the
same way as you.

00:10:49.766 --> 00:10:51.503
In junior high I had tons
of guy friends

00:10:51.603 --> 00:10:53.841
that I didn't fall in love
with them one after another.

00:10:53.941 --> 00:10:56.111
- Really? You had a lot
of male friends?

00:10:56.212 --> 00:10:58.416
I don't think I've ever had
a relationship with a guy

00:10:58.517 --> 00:10:59.752
where we were just friends ever.

00:10:59.853 --> 00:11:01.556
Why is that?

00:11:01.656 --> 00:11:03.594
- Because you look at men
as males

00:11:03.694 --> 00:11:05.296
and you don't realize
that inside

00:11:05.396 --> 00:11:06.733
they're actually human beings.

00:11:06.833 --> 00:11:08.202
- Right, that makes total sense.

00:11:08.302 --> 00:11:11.543
So I need to change
the way I look at them.

00:11:11.643 --> 00:11:12.545
That's it. I've decided!

00:11:12.645 --> 00:11:16.018
Shoji and I are gonna become
friends and nothing else.

00:11:16.118 --> 00:11:17.187
- Uh...

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:23.901
Nana, you can't just decide

00:11:24.001 --> 00:11:25.036
to become friends with someone.

00:11:25.136 --> 00:11:27.642
- But if I don't make a
conscious choice to become
friends,

00:11:27.742 --> 00:11:29.044
I'm gonna fall in love with him.

00:11:29.144 --> 00:11:30.814
- If you fall in love, you fall
in love

00:11:30.915 --> 00:11:32.618
and there's nothing you can do
about it,

00:11:32.718 --> 00:11:33.386
but there's nothing wrong

00:11:33.486 --> 00:11:35.223
with trying to just be friends
with him.

00:11:35.323 --> 00:11:37.494
In fact, in your case, I
think it's a great idea.

00:11:37.595 --> 00:11:41.268
- Thanks so much Jun! I'm
gonna give it my best shot.

00:11:41.368 --> 00:11:42.204
- Your best shot?

00:11:42.304 --> 00:11:45.143
(phone rings)

00:11:45.878 --> 00:11:47.648
This is Junko.

00:11:47.748 --> 00:11:50.186
Oh, hi there, Shoji.

00:11:50.286 --> 00:11:51.255
- [Nana] No.

00:11:51.355 --> 00:11:52.725
Okay. Calm down.

00:11:52.825 --> 00:11:55.496
I gotta remember, we're
just friends.

00:11:55.598 --> 00:11:56.600
(gentle music)

00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:58.002
- Hey we're here!

00:11:58.102 --> 00:12:00.306
- Thanks for inviting us over.

00:12:00.406 --> 00:12:02.077
- Wow. So awesome!

00:12:02.177 --> 00:12:04.114
Even though your parents live
in town,

00:12:04.214 --> 00:12:05.216
you still got your own place.

00:12:05.316 --> 00:12:07.822
- Well that's 'cause their
house is really far from school.

00:12:07.922 --> 00:12:10.527
- [Shoji] I live far away too.

00:12:10.628 --> 00:12:12.030
- Poor Shoji. He'd get so lonely

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:13.867
if he had to move out of
his grandmother's place.

00:12:13.967 --> 00:12:15.638
- Actually. That's true.

00:12:15.738 --> 00:12:17.541
- Where do you live, Kyosuke?

00:12:17.642 --> 00:12:18.810
- Not far from here.

00:12:18.911 --> 00:12:19.879
- Really? Where?

00:12:19.979 --> 00:12:22.117
- [Kyosuke] Just behind
the convenience store.

00:12:22.217 --> 00:12:23.787
- [Junko] No way! We're
practically neighbors.

00:12:23.887 --> 00:12:24.889
- [Nana] Friends, friends.

00:12:24.989 --> 00:12:27.427
- You've been pretty quiet so
far, Nana.

00:12:27.528 --> 00:12:29.732
I thought you were supposed
to be a loud mouth.

00:12:29.832 --> 00:12:31.368
Don't tell me you've gone all
shy.

00:12:31.468 --> 00:12:33.072
- No, no, that's not it at all.

00:12:33.172 --> 00:12:35.945
Damn. How do I talk to him as a
friend?

00:12:36.045 --> 00:12:38.684
- Oh, maybe you don't
do so well around guys

00:12:38.784 --> 00:12:40.153
because you went to an all-girls
school.

00:12:40.253 --> 00:12:42.490
- That isn't the case at all.

00:12:42.591 --> 00:12:45.296
Actually Nana was seeing
someone until just recently-

00:12:45.396 --> 00:12:46.298
- [Nana] Jun!

00:12:46.398 --> 00:12:47.367
- Oh, come on Nana.

00:12:47.467 --> 00:12:48.069
What's the big deal?

00:12:48.169 --> 00:12:49.271
The more we open up to each
other,

00:12:49.371 --> 00:12:50.608
the quicker we can all become
friends.

00:12:50.708 --> 00:12:53.847
- All right! What do you say
we start off with a toast?

00:12:53.947 --> 00:12:55.985
- [Nana] She's right. If
they're gonna be my friends,

00:12:56.085 --> 00:12:57.822
I should be able to open up to
them.

00:12:57.922 --> 00:12:58.724
- [All] Cheers.

00:12:58.824 --> 00:13:00.728
- [Nana] Okay. I better get
drunk fast

00:13:00.828 --> 00:13:02.765
so I can loosen up a little.

00:13:05.336 --> 00:13:08.877
Then I fell hopelessly in
love with baby face Yoshita,

00:13:08.977 --> 00:13:10.648
the pizza delivery guy.

00:13:10.748 --> 00:13:12.350
- Baby face Yoshita!

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:12.985
(Shoji laughs)

00:13:13.085 --> 00:13:14.522
- I'm not kidding! He was really
cute!

00:13:14.622 --> 00:13:16.158
- Okay, you two, keep it down.

00:13:16.258 --> 00:13:18.563
You've had too much to drink.

00:13:18.664 --> 00:13:19.532
- And you know what?

00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:20.199
- [Shoji] Yeah?

00:13:20.299 --> 00:13:21.201
- I kept ordering pizza so I
could see him

00:13:21.302 --> 00:13:23.674
and gained 10 pounds, but
then he quit or something

00:13:23.774 --> 00:13:25.911
and never came back. Leaving me
fat.

00:13:26.011 --> 00:13:26.813
And for nothing!

00:13:26.913 --> 00:13:27.848
- Nana. You are hilarious.

00:13:27.948 --> 00:13:29.351
Isn't she hilarious?

00:13:29.451 --> 00:13:30.721
- Nana, I think you've had
enough.

00:13:30.821 --> 00:13:33.492
- It's all right. She's very
entertaining.

00:13:33.593 --> 00:13:34.729
- Okay. Who was next?

00:13:34.829 --> 00:13:35.764
Who was the next guy?

00:13:35.864 --> 00:13:37.434
- The next one was...

00:13:37.535 --> 00:13:38.035
(Shoji laughs)

00:13:38.135 --> 00:13:39.906
- [Shoji] Seriously. There's
more?

00:13:40.006 --> 00:13:42.243
(dramatic music)

00:13:42.344 --> 00:13:48.122
- The next one was the man
whose name I didn't know.

00:13:58.376 --> 00:14:02.484
Hey. I didn't think
I'd ever see you again.

00:14:04.287 --> 00:14:08.229
I never asked your name
and you didn't tell me.

00:14:14.307 --> 00:14:15.978
- Takashi Asano.

00:14:17.447 --> 00:14:18.717
- Please just stop.

00:14:18.817 --> 00:14:19.652
- Huh?

00:14:19.752 --> 00:14:21.956
- He probably made up that name
anyway.

00:14:22.057 --> 00:14:23.426
(Nana sobs)

00:14:23.527 --> 00:14:24.061
- Nana...

00:14:24.161 --> 00:14:25.229
- Does this always
happen when she's drunk?

00:14:25.329 --> 00:14:26.733
- Nana, what's the matter?

00:14:26.833 --> 00:14:28.235
- [Nana] No!

00:14:28.335 --> 00:14:29.204
- Nana...

00:14:29.304 --> 00:14:30.373
Sorry Shoji.

00:14:30.473 --> 00:14:31.408
Come here.

00:14:31.509 --> 00:14:32.110
- Junko...

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:33.947
- It's okay. You've just
had too much to drink.

00:14:34.047 --> 00:14:35.283
That's all.

00:14:35.918 --> 00:14:37.755
- [Nana] Don't touch me.

00:14:37.855 --> 00:14:40.059
You never really loved me.

00:14:41.896 --> 00:14:43.265
Don't touch me.

00:14:52.885 --> 00:14:55.858
- Junko? I really need to get
going now.

00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.227
I don't wanna miss the last
train.

00:14:57.327 --> 00:15:00.199
- That's right. You live pretty
far away.

00:15:00.299 --> 00:15:02.404
- Oh. And Kyosuke's fallen
asleep.

00:15:02.505 --> 00:15:04.141
Is it okay if I just leave him
here?

00:15:04.241 --> 00:15:06.011
- Sure. That won't be a problem.

00:15:06.111 --> 00:15:08.282
- Thanks a lot, Junko. See ya.

00:15:08.382 --> 00:15:10.386
- Can I ask you something,
Shoji?

00:15:10.486 --> 00:15:10.687
- Hm?

00:15:10.788 --> 00:15:13.459
- You're not seeing
anyone right now. Are you?

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:16.365
- Why? You've fallen in love
with me?

00:15:16.465 --> 00:15:17.968
What are you looking at me like
that for?

00:15:18.068 --> 00:15:18.469
I'll have you know,

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:20.607
I had a ton of girlfriends
when I was in high school!

00:15:20.707 --> 00:15:22.945
It just so happens that
right now I'm single.

00:15:23.045 --> 00:15:25.851
- (chuckling) I might have
guessed.

00:15:25.951 --> 00:15:28.857
And you only came here tonight
so you could see Nana, right?

00:15:28.957 --> 00:15:31.830
- Yeah. But Nana hates me.

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:33.466
She said, "No!"

00:15:33.567 --> 00:15:35.904
- No, I don't think she hates
you.

00:15:36.004 --> 00:15:36.806
Ever since she first saw you,

00:15:36.906 --> 00:15:39.946
she's been going on about how
adorable and cool you are.

00:15:40.046 --> 00:15:41.883
- No way!

00:15:41.983 --> 00:15:43.085
- Anyway. Best of luck to you.

00:15:43.185 --> 00:15:45.256
- What do you mean?

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:51.603
(Nana groans)

00:15:54.909 --> 00:15:56.813
- Where on earth am I?

00:15:56.913 --> 00:15:58.750
Oh, my head.

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:00.419
What the heck happened?

00:16:00.521 --> 00:16:03.025
All right. Oh right, I'm at
Jun's place.

00:16:03.125 --> 00:16:04.494
- [All] Cheers!

00:16:04.595 --> 00:16:07.100
- Kyosuke and Shoji
brought over some beer.

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.237
We started drinking and then...

00:16:09.337 --> 00:16:10.908
Well then I don't remember much,

00:16:11.008 --> 00:16:12.978
but I think I had a fun time.

00:16:13.078 --> 00:16:15.851
(Nana groans)

00:16:15.951 --> 00:16:17.220
I never called home.

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:20.426
I'm gonna be in big trouble.

00:16:20.527 --> 00:16:23.733
Jun, you got anything
for a head-

00:16:23.834 --> 00:16:24.969
Ah...

00:16:25.069 --> 00:16:26.271
- Yeah.

00:16:28.442 --> 00:16:29.211
It's not what it looks like.

00:16:29.311 --> 00:16:32.618
I mean, we just meant the
whole night talking, you know,

00:16:32.718 --> 00:16:34.087
and we hit it off.

00:16:34.187 --> 00:16:35.356
So we just.

00:16:35.456 --> 00:16:37.661
- [Nana] Why is she
explaining herself to me?

00:16:37.761 --> 00:16:38.830
- Well, you know,

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:41.368
I was hoping this would
happen 'cause I liked Junko

00:16:41.468 --> 00:16:42.872
from the first moment I saw her.

00:16:42.972 --> 00:16:45.978
- Well put, Kyosuke.
I totally understand.

00:16:46.078 --> 00:16:49.217
Falling in love
isn't about logic.

00:16:49.317 --> 00:16:51.689
- And Nana's the expert
on that subject.

00:16:51.789 --> 00:16:53.058
- Huh? An expert.

00:16:53.158 --> 00:16:55.129
How do you know about-

00:16:55.229 --> 00:16:56.633
Jun! You blabbermouth.

00:16:56.733 --> 00:16:57.835
- I didn't tell them! You did!

00:16:57.935 --> 00:16:59.004
Remember?

00:16:59.104 --> 00:16:59.572
- I did?

00:16:59.672 --> 00:17:02.310
- Well, I think
I should get going.

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:03.580
I don't want to be
late for school

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:06.051
and I need to go home
and get changed.

00:17:06.151 --> 00:17:07.621
- Nana. You won't have
time to go home.

00:17:07.721 --> 00:17:09.257
You wanna borrow
something of mine to wear?

00:17:09.357 --> 00:17:11.128
- I can't believe I told them!

00:17:11.228 --> 00:17:13.065
How much do they know?

00:17:13.165 --> 00:17:14.769
- You started with Mr. Okamoto,

00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:15.269
the art teacher.

00:17:15.369 --> 00:17:17.140
Then Nakamora at the
video store.

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:20.079
Kawasaki the cook. And
Yoshida the pizza delivery man.

00:17:20.179 --> 00:17:22.283
You made quite a joke
out of it all.

00:17:22.383 --> 00:17:23.820
- What was I thinking...

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:25.022
- When you got to Takashi...

00:17:25.122 --> 00:17:27.293
Well, it's obvious you
haven't gotten him

00:17:27.393 --> 00:17:28.830
outta your system yet.

00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:30.132
- I've forgotten all about him.

00:17:30.233 --> 00:17:31.301
Can talk about it no problem.

00:17:31.401 --> 00:17:33.072
I laughed about him
like all the rest.

00:17:33.172 --> 00:17:34.374
- [Junko] No, you were crying.

00:17:34.474 --> 00:17:35.510
- Huh?

00:17:36.746 --> 00:17:38.650
- As soon as you started
to talk about him,

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:42.357
you broke down in tears
right in front of us.

00:17:42.457 --> 00:17:44.695
So anyway, what do
you think Shoji?

00:17:44.795 --> 00:17:46.198
Do you want me to
fix you up with him?

00:17:46.298 --> 00:17:47.701
He's kind of cute.

00:17:47.801 --> 00:17:48.870
- Why would you say that?

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:49.605
Are you feeling guilty

00:17:49.705 --> 00:17:51.643
because you got together
with Kyosuke?

00:17:51.743 --> 00:17:53.012
- No, that's not it.

00:17:53.112 --> 00:17:55.016
I'm just saying Shoji
is a really nice guy.

00:17:55.116 --> 00:17:56.986
And I think if he had
a girlfriend,

00:17:57.086 --> 00:17:58.857
he'd be totally loyal to her.

00:17:58.957 --> 00:18:01.930
If you two got together,
he'd treat you well, Nana.

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:03.332
I guarantee it.

00:18:04.167 --> 00:18:05.871
- Jun, you're so amazing!

00:18:05.971 --> 00:18:06.606
If you were a guy,

00:18:06.706 --> 00:18:09.044
I would definitely wanna
be your girlfriend.

00:18:09.144 --> 00:18:09.946
- Oh God no.

00:18:10.046 --> 00:18:11.148
I never wanna go out with you.

00:18:11.248 --> 00:18:12.450
- You don't have to worry.

00:18:12.551 --> 00:18:15.524
Shoji and I are going to be
good friends. That's all.

00:18:15.624 --> 00:18:16.091
- [Junko] Huh?

00:18:16.191 --> 00:18:17.493
- Shoji's friendship is
important to me.

00:18:17.594 --> 00:18:18.797
And I think that would be ruined

00:18:18.897 --> 00:18:20.333
if he became just a boyfriend.

00:18:20.433 --> 00:18:21.903
- Just a boyfriend?

00:18:22.003 --> 00:18:23.773
- Junko! Nana!

00:18:25.777 --> 00:18:26.445
Good morning.

00:18:26.546 --> 00:18:28.215
You're looking pretty good,
Nana.

00:18:28.315 --> 00:18:29.417
- I feel pretty good.

00:18:29.518 --> 00:18:31.221
I did wake up with a bit of a
headache,

00:18:31.321 --> 00:18:32.658
but a couple of aspirin did the
trick.

00:18:32.758 --> 00:18:34.528
I didn't see leave last night,
Shoji.

00:18:34.629 --> 00:18:36.331
- [Junko] That certainly
perked her up.

00:18:36.431 --> 00:18:38.570
Oh well, nevermind.

00:18:39.204 --> 00:18:40.574
- Really?

00:18:40.674 --> 00:18:43.412
- [Junko] Oh, I guess she'll be
all right.

00:18:44.982 --> 00:18:45.449
- A movie?

00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:47.487
- Yeah. You said you like
going to the movies, right?

00:18:47.588 --> 00:18:49.190
So I thought if you're free,

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:50.727
maybe we could get together and
go-

00:18:50.827 --> 00:18:51.796
- Sorry. No.

00:18:51.896 --> 00:18:54.100
I only like going to see
movies on my own.

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:57.708
Having a friend sit beside
me would be too distracting.

00:19:00.012 --> 00:19:01.983
- [Takashi] Yeah, I understand.

00:19:02.083 --> 00:19:03.853
It's the same for me.

00:19:06.626 --> 00:19:08.963
(Nana yelps)

00:19:09.064 --> 00:19:12.103
- What? Oh, what have you
got against me, demon Lord?

00:19:12.203 --> 00:19:13.372
- Demon Lord?

00:19:13.472 --> 00:19:14.608
- For my entire life

00:19:14.709 --> 00:19:16.713
I've been cursed by the
demon Lord of terror.

00:19:16.813 --> 00:19:18.349
- What's that about?

00:19:18.449 --> 00:19:19.518
You were just a bit clumsy.

00:19:19.618 --> 00:19:22.323
It was an accident.
Now gimme your hand.

00:19:23.827 --> 00:19:24.427
(Nana winces)

00:19:24.528 --> 00:19:25.530
We've got to do this.

00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:29.304
It'll get infected and hurt
even more if you leave it.

00:19:29.404 --> 00:19:30.540
- [Nana] If you leave it...

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:33.546
- It's obvious you haven't
gotten him outta your system
yet.

00:19:33.646 --> 00:19:34.849
(dramatic
piano music)

00:19:34.949 --> 00:19:36.218
- It's true.

00:19:36.318 --> 00:19:36.886
I can't forget him.

00:19:36.986 --> 00:19:41.028
And the hurt is spreading
like an infection, Jun.

00:19:41.128 --> 00:19:43.833
It gets worse as time goes by.

00:19:43.933 --> 00:19:46.639
The more I look back on
the time I spent with him,

00:19:46.739 --> 00:19:50.012
the more I think that everything
we had together was a lie.

00:19:50.112 --> 00:19:54.287
Sometimes it hurts so much
I feel like I'm going to die.

00:19:54.387 --> 00:19:59.130
If I go on like this,
my body will rot away.

00:19:59.230 --> 00:19:59.932
I can't take it anymore!

00:20:00.032 --> 00:20:01.134
- Okay. I'm done.

00:20:01.234 --> 00:20:02.805
Your finger's gonna be fine.

00:20:02.905 --> 00:20:05.610
It'll heal in no time.

00:20:05.711 --> 00:20:08.583
- Thank you Shoji. That
was really nice of you.

00:20:08.683 --> 00:20:10.854
- [Shoji] No, I'm not that nice.

00:20:10.954 --> 00:20:12.591
Okay. Maybe just a little.

00:20:12.691 --> 00:20:15.029
- Shoji... I'm wondering.

00:20:15.129 --> 00:20:17.534
Do you know how to mend
a broken heart?

00:20:17.634 --> 00:20:19.270
- [Shoji] Huh? A broken heart.

00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:20.507
- Know what I think?

00:20:20.607 --> 00:20:22.276
The only way is to fall
in love again.

00:20:22.376 --> 00:20:24.882
That's the only cure.
Don't you think?

00:20:24.982 --> 00:20:27.420
- Ha, absolutely.

00:20:27.521 --> 00:20:30.827
(romantic piano music)

00:20:30.927 --> 00:20:31.729
Nana I-

00:20:31.829 --> 00:20:33.700
- Good! It's decided!

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:36.171
I need you to tell me where to
find all the cool young guys

00:20:36.271 --> 00:20:37.340
that hang out around here.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:38.643
- Cool young guys?

00:20:38.743 --> 00:20:40.947
- Yeah. People my age,
no one wearing a suit.

00:20:41.047 --> 00:20:42.483
- At the arcade?

00:20:42.584 --> 00:20:44.087
- Nah, that's filled
with kids and old guys.

00:20:44.187 --> 00:20:45.022
Too geeky.

00:20:45.122 --> 00:20:46.191
Somewhere a bit more hip.

00:20:46.291 --> 00:20:48.663
- I guess you could
always try a club?

00:20:48.763 --> 00:20:49.832
- That's it!

00:20:54.007 --> 00:20:57.180
(uplifting music)

00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:59.417
I will fall in love.

00:20:59.518 --> 00:21:01.522
I gotta start all over again.

00:21:01.622 --> 00:21:05.329
I'll stop crying over a love
that's already disappeared.

00:21:05.429 --> 00:21:07.968
I really need to fall deeply
in love

00:21:08.068 --> 00:21:11.876
and that way I can banish
my former pathetic self

00:21:11.976 --> 00:21:13.746
into the darkness.
