00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:03.206
(birds chirping)

00:00:04.323 --> 00:00:06.529
- [Nana Komatsu] Those two
weeks Nana stayed at Ren's,

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.302
I kept myself busy with work
so that I wouldn't feel lonely.

00:00:10.937 --> 00:00:12.172
I took on extra shifts,

00:00:12.273 --> 00:00:15.445
and every day I worked
till I dropped,

00:00:15.547 --> 00:00:17.517
(birds chirping)

00:00:17.617 --> 00:00:21.491
but I made sure I never missed
one of Blast's rehearsals.

00:00:21.592 --> 00:00:22.159
(birds chirping)

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:24.998
Afterwards, Nobu would
always walk me home.

00:00:25.098 --> 00:00:26.267
(birds chirping)

00:00:26.367 --> 00:00:30.843
As for Takumi, I didn't
hear from him at all.

00:00:30.944 --> 00:00:33.683
(rock music)

00:02:10.576 --> 00:02:12.781
- I'm thinking of
going on a trip.

00:02:12.881 --> 00:02:14.150
- That sounds like a great idea.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.887
Bring me back a souvenir.

00:02:15.987 --> 00:02:16.822
(chair scraping on floor)

00:02:16.922 --> 00:02:18.158
I'm finished.

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:21.765
- Isn't there somewhere you want
to go?

00:02:21.865 --> 00:02:22.967
- Go on your own.

00:02:23.068 --> 00:02:24.270
Maybe you've got nothing to do,

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.840
but I'm kind of busy right now.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.009
- Take some time off work.

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:27.544
- No way.

00:02:27.644 --> 00:02:29.313
We've got an important gig
coming up.

00:02:29.413 --> 00:02:31.752
We have to practice every day.

00:02:32.252 --> 00:02:33.989
- Huh?

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.359
Hey, how come you're on the pill
again?

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:36.895
- Someone's gotta be
responsible.

00:02:36.995 --> 00:02:39.701
You want a kid that bad go
find yourself another womb.

00:02:39.801 --> 00:02:42.874
- [Guy] You wouldn't mind me
sleeping with someone else?

00:02:42.974 --> 00:02:44.911
You can be such an ice queen.

00:02:45.011 --> 00:02:47.182
- You just realize that now?

00:02:48.418 --> 00:02:53.896
- Hmm. I'm gonna write a
song for the lovely Reira.

00:02:53.996 --> 00:02:55.165
- Ugh.

00:02:55.265 --> 00:02:56.869
(knife hitting board)

00:02:56.969 --> 00:02:59.808
(liquid pouring)

00:02:59.908 --> 00:03:02.446
(bottle hitting counter)

00:03:02.547 --> 00:03:05.318
(lemon juice dripping)

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:09.260
(stirrer tapping glass)

00:03:10.696 --> 00:03:13.301
- Oh Shin, I didn't know you
were awake.

00:03:13.401 --> 00:03:16.174
- Good morning Miss Ryoko.

00:03:16.274 --> 00:03:18.044
- [Miss Ryoko] I'm going
on a trip to the states.

00:03:18.144 --> 00:03:19.413
My flight leaves tomorrow,

00:03:19.514 --> 00:03:21.518
so I won't be seeing you for a
while,

00:03:21.618 --> 00:03:23.589
but just wait till you see all
the stuff

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:24.925
I'm gonna bring back for you.

00:03:25.025 --> 00:03:25.960
- You don't have to do that.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.333
It's gonna be pretty lonely
without you around here, Ryoko.

00:03:29.433 --> 00:03:30.503
- That's sweet.

00:03:30.603 --> 00:03:31.471
You ever thought of adding

00:03:31.572 --> 00:03:33.408
the art of sweet talking
to your resume?

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:35.479
Or maybe it's just something
you learned from me.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.517
- I appreciate everything
you've done for me.

00:03:37.617 --> 00:03:39.286
Thanks to you, business is
booming.

00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:40.422
(Ryoko giggles)

00:03:40.523 --> 00:03:44.363
- Oh, I turned an angel
into a little devil.

00:03:47.035 --> 00:03:47.637
- The more I see you,

00:03:47.737 --> 00:03:50.810
the less and less you
remind me of her.

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.146
- Huh? What was that?

00:03:52.246 --> 00:03:54.116
- Oh, nothing just talking to
myself.

00:03:54.216 --> 00:03:55.485
Seconds, please!

00:03:56.588 --> 00:04:00.295
(gentle piano music)

00:04:03.401 --> 00:04:06.007
- [Blonde Guy] Hey, Yasu!

00:04:06.107 --> 00:04:09.714
- Long time no see you really
haven't changed a bit dude

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:11.952
Oh, gimme a stout.

00:04:12.052 --> 00:04:12.987
So how you doing?

00:04:13.087 --> 00:04:13.622
This is great.

00:04:13.722 --> 00:04:15.225
We finally get to meet up.

00:04:15.325 --> 00:04:16.862
- Well, you've been very
persistent.

00:04:16.962 --> 00:04:17.229
I'll give you that.

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.133
- [Blonde Guy] I was hoping
Reira would be able to come

00:04:19.233 --> 00:04:20.603
but she went back home for a
visit.

00:04:20.703 --> 00:04:22.272
She would've loved to have been
here.

00:04:22.372 --> 00:04:23.007
- [Yasu] Oh yeah.

00:04:23.107 --> 00:04:25.613
By the way, you might
wanna keep your voice down.

00:04:25.713 --> 00:04:27.851
Now that you're a celebrity
shouldn't you be trying

00:04:27.951 --> 00:04:28.919
to keep a low profile.

00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:29.821
- Now this place is cool.

00:04:29.921 --> 00:04:31.959
It's where everyone in the biz
hangs out.

00:04:32.059 --> 00:04:32.961
- Really?

00:04:33.061 --> 00:04:33.629
- You know

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:36.367
I heard you moved here so you
could get signed by a label.

00:04:36.467 --> 00:04:38.906
Reira was bitchin how
she didn't get it.

00:04:39.006 --> 00:04:40.710
- Yeah. I probably
could have guessed that.

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.279
That's why I don't wanna run
into her.

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:44.016
She would never let
me live it down.

00:04:44.116 --> 00:04:45.185
- Of course she wouldn't.

00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:46.387
And you can't really blame her.

00:04:46.487 --> 00:04:48.926
I mean, why did you
change your mind?

00:04:49.026 --> 00:04:50.530
- Uh well, let's see.

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:51.097
I guess you could say

00:04:51.197 --> 00:04:54.771
I feel a parental
responsibility towards the band.

00:04:54.871 --> 00:04:55.640
- What the hell?

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.610
You really haven't changed Yasu.

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:59.480
You need to let loose sometimes,
you know

00:04:59.581 --> 00:05:01.618
go wild for a change.

00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:04.023
Not that I recommend Takumi
style.

00:05:04.123 --> 00:05:06.027
When he gets mad, it's criminal.

00:05:06.127 --> 00:05:08.398
He's managed to keep his
cool lately, but that's only

00:05:08.498 --> 00:05:10.703
cause he's afraid of causing
a scandal for the band.

00:05:10.803 --> 00:05:11.805
Back when we were in junior high

00:05:11.905 --> 00:05:14.109
the school didn't have any
windows cause he broke them all.

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.750
- Yeah, I remember speaking
of Takumi, what's he up to?

00:05:17.851 --> 00:05:20.422
He never answers his
cell phone when I call.

00:05:20.523 --> 00:05:21.692
- I don't know.

00:05:21.792 --> 00:05:24.865
He's probably just too busy
sleeping around to answer

00:05:24.965 --> 00:05:27.202
but I'm sure there's
nothing to worry about.

00:05:27.302 --> 00:05:28.906
- Hmm. Yeah.

00:05:29.006 --> 00:05:30.375
If you say so.

00:05:32.981 --> 00:05:35.720
(ocean waves)

00:05:36.922 --> 00:05:39.694
(bird noises)

00:05:54.524 --> 00:05:57.496
(ocean waves)

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:11.925
- Hm

00:06:12.025 --> 00:06:15.031
- Reira what the hell are you
doing here?

00:06:15.131 --> 00:06:16.434
- I came to visit my mom.

00:06:16.535 --> 00:06:18.572
- Oh right, I forgot
she lived around here.

00:06:18.672 --> 00:06:20.910
Oh you shouldn't sneak up
on me like that.

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.912
How long you been here?

00:06:22.012 --> 00:06:23.114
- 30 minutes.

00:06:23.214 --> 00:06:24.584
- What?

00:06:24.684 --> 00:06:26.387
- Hmm. I can't believe it
Tukami.

00:06:26.487 --> 00:06:27.189
I was standing there looking at
you

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:30.228
for half an hour and
you didn't even notice me.

00:06:30.328 --> 00:06:31.430
You were no fun at all.

00:06:31.531 --> 00:06:33.636
- No, I meant how long
you've been in town.

00:06:33.736 --> 00:06:35.105
And if you wanted my attention

00:06:35.205 --> 00:06:36.107
you should have said something.

00:06:36.207 --> 00:06:38.177
- [Reira] Oh I've been here
three days.

00:06:38.278 --> 00:06:41.017
I came to visit mom's grave.

00:06:41.117 --> 00:06:44.156
- Your mom's grave? But
your mom's still alive.

00:06:44.256 --> 00:06:45.693
- Your mom's grave.

00:06:45.793 --> 00:06:47.664
I knew you couldn't be there
for the seventh anniversary

00:06:47.764 --> 00:06:49.199
of her death cause you were
working.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.540
So I went in your place and
asked her to please watch

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:53.676
over you and try to protect you

00:06:53.776 --> 00:06:56.748
from the wrath of the gods
for being such a naughty boy.

00:06:56.848 --> 00:06:57.884
- Well, thanks for doing that

00:06:57.984 --> 00:06:59.821
- By the way how's your dad
doing?

00:06:59.921 --> 00:07:02.092
Maybe I should go say hi
to him while I'm in town.

00:07:02.192 --> 00:07:02.894
- Nah, don't even bother.

00:07:02.994 --> 00:07:05.432
He's been drinking
all day as usual.

00:07:05.533 --> 00:07:06.768
- It must be hard for your big
sis

00:07:06.868 --> 00:07:07.770
and her husband having to
deal

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:10.108
with a drunk father and
a little brother.

00:07:10.208 --> 00:07:11.077
- Worry about your own mom

00:07:11.177 --> 00:07:13.348
instead of scrutinizing
other people's families.

00:07:13.448 --> 00:07:16.387
You just dumped her out here
in the middle of the boonies.

00:07:16.487 --> 00:07:17.757
- Hmm.

00:07:17.857 --> 00:07:19.694
- [Reira] She doesn't wanna live
in Tokyo.

00:07:19.794 --> 00:07:21.832
She happens to love it here.

00:07:26.374 --> 00:07:29.480
- That doesn't make a
whole lot of sense to me.

00:07:29.581 --> 00:07:30.315
I mean, what's so great

00:07:30.415 --> 00:07:32.085
about living in the middle of
nowhere

00:07:32.185 --> 00:07:34.658
especially since she lived
in New York for a while.

00:07:34.758 --> 00:07:36.293
- [Reira] Maybe that's why,

00:07:36.394 --> 00:07:38.666
she didn't really like
living overseas.

00:07:38.766 --> 00:07:41.972
I have tried telling her
Tokyo isn't a foreign country.

00:07:42.072 --> 00:07:44.276
Sometimes I miss New York
and I think

00:07:44.376 --> 00:07:47.884
about going back there it is
where I was born after all.

00:07:47.984 --> 00:07:50.956
- Yeah, you should have gone
except it's too late now.

00:07:51.057 --> 00:07:54.163
We got two days left before
we start working again.

00:07:54.263 --> 00:07:55.365
- Yeah I know,

00:07:55.465 --> 00:07:56.968
but I had a lot of things to do

00:07:57.069 --> 00:07:59.406
and I felt like I needed to
see my mom.

00:07:59.507 --> 00:08:00.976
The day we played near here
on tour

00:08:01.077 --> 00:08:03.816
the schedule was too
tight to find time for a visit.

00:08:03.916 --> 00:08:05.619
So when did you get here?

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.291
- I always end up having
to work when I'm in Tokyo.

00:08:08.391 --> 00:08:11.998
This seemed like as good a
place as any for an escape.

00:08:12.099 --> 00:08:12.834
But now that I'm here

00:08:12.934 --> 00:08:15.138
I can't seem to get my
mind off of work.

00:08:15.238 --> 00:08:16.875
So I might as well head on back.

00:08:16.975 --> 00:08:19.012
It was only gonna be a
short visit anyway.

00:08:19.113 --> 00:08:21.952
- What? But it's so crazy
we ran into each other here.

00:08:22.052 --> 00:08:24.557
We should hang out together
first and have some fun.

00:08:24.657 --> 00:08:26.093
- Come on, gimme a break.

00:08:26.193 --> 00:08:28.866
I've gotta at least
spend my time off alone.

00:08:28.966 --> 00:08:30.068
See you later.

00:08:30.836 --> 00:08:36.013
- Hmm.

00:08:38.017 --> 00:08:39.119
- Oh Reira

00:08:41.925 --> 00:08:44.597
Don't forget we got that
big photo shoot next week,

00:08:44.697 --> 00:08:45.699
so stay out of the sun

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:49.273
- Eye, eye captain message
received loud and clear.

00:08:49.373 --> 00:08:52.780
(drums playing)

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.751
- What the hell does he think
he's doing?

00:08:54.851 --> 00:08:56.220
He should have called you.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:57.790
Their vacation time's nearly up.

00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:00.261
- Yeah, but I haven't
contacted him either.

00:09:00.361 --> 00:09:00.930
- Why not?

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:01.865
Why are you holding back?

00:09:01.965 --> 00:09:04.203
You should be sending him
text messages every day.

00:09:04.303 --> 00:09:05.873
That's the only way
you can be sure.

00:09:05.973 --> 00:09:07.409
You're constantly on his mind

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:09.848
- [Nana] But what's the point
if he's just gonna ignore me?

00:09:09.948 --> 00:09:11.450
- [Nana O] But when
the band goes back on tour

00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:13.020
you're gonna hear from
him even less.

00:09:13.121 --> 00:09:16.862
- [Nana] Yeah. Well that's
the way the cookie crumbles.

00:09:18.397 --> 00:09:19.768
- Yasu Hachi's your friend too.

00:09:19.868 --> 00:09:21.203
Don't you give a crap about her.

00:09:21.303 --> 00:09:22.540
You should be calling Takumi

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:25.546
and giving him hell
for ignoring her.

00:09:25.646 --> 00:09:27.449
- But he won't answer his phone.

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:28.685
- [Hachi] Nana!

00:09:28.786 --> 00:09:29.988
I don't want him to come and see
me just

00:09:30.088 --> 00:09:32.693
because someone was putting
pressure on him to do it.

00:09:32.794 --> 00:09:36.133
I'm fine with it honestly.
It's no big deal.

00:09:37.135 --> 00:09:38.137
(bottle drops)

00:09:38.237 --> 00:09:39.039
- They don't believe me.

00:09:39.139 --> 00:09:40.442
They probably think I'm just
putting

00:09:40.543 --> 00:09:43.448
on a brave face, trying to stay
strong.

00:09:43.549 --> 00:09:44.249
But to be honest

00:09:44.349 --> 00:09:47.890
I don't think I'd care if
Takumi ever called me again.

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:50.094
It'd be totally fine with me.

00:09:50.195 --> 00:09:53.602
In fact, I think it's better
that way.

00:09:53.702 --> 00:09:54.504
- [Shin] Oh.

00:09:54.604 --> 00:09:55.038
- Huh?

00:09:55.138 --> 00:09:57.008
- [Shin] Hachi get one for
me too.

00:09:57.108 --> 00:09:58.579
- [Nobu] Get it yourself.

00:09:58.679 --> 00:10:01.618
- Hmm. You sure you
don't wanna buy me one?

00:10:01.718 --> 00:10:03.321
(Hachi giggles)

00:10:43.234 --> 00:10:45.338
(footsteps walking)

00:10:45.438 --> 00:10:49.246
- Have you noticed Nana's voice
seems to be getting stronger

00:10:49.346 --> 00:10:50.816
and stronger every day.

00:10:50.916 --> 00:10:52.854
You think it's the sit ups?

00:10:52.954 --> 00:10:55.593
We're gonna get our big
break soon, I can feel it.

00:10:55.693 --> 00:10:58.599
- Trapnest has two
more days off.

00:10:58.699 --> 00:11:01.237
If I don't hear from Takami,
everyone's gonna feel sorry

00:11:01.337 --> 00:11:04.343
for the poor dumb girl who
allowed herself to be duped

00:11:04.443 --> 00:11:06.681
and dumped by a total player.

00:11:07.617 --> 00:11:10.255
- I can blame everything on
Takami

00:11:10.355 --> 00:11:14.029
and be free to fall in
love with someone else.

00:11:14.129 --> 00:11:17.369
But if Nobu had any idea
I was thinking like this

00:11:17.469 --> 00:11:19.707
he'd probably hate me for it.

00:11:20.876 --> 00:11:22.747
- [Hachi] It's crazy to
become his girlfriend.

00:11:22.847 --> 00:11:25.184
Just because Takami dumped me.

00:11:26.353 --> 00:11:29.393
- I don't want Nobu to
think I'm a slut.

00:11:30.996 --> 00:11:34.871
But the truth is, I guess I am.

00:11:38.545 --> 00:11:40.181
- [Hachi] That black SUV.

00:11:47.362 --> 00:11:50.468
Nobu, you don't have
to walk me all the way.

00:11:50.569 --> 00:11:51.036
- [Nobu] Huh?

00:11:51.136 --> 00:11:52.439
- I'll be all right on my own
from here,

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:53.976
the apartments just over there.

00:11:54.076 --> 00:11:56.380
I'm sorry for making you
walk me home when it's so

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:58.150
out of your way.

00:11:58.251 --> 00:12:00.321
- It's not that far
and I really don't mind

00:12:00.421 --> 00:12:02.225
but if it bothers you
I'm sure Shin or Yasu-

00:12:02.325 --> 00:12:05.164
- No no, it's fine. It
doesn't bother me at all.

00:12:05.265 --> 00:12:06.267
- [Takami] Nana.

00:12:12.212 --> 00:12:14.182
- [Nana] I wish I'd known he
was gonna show up like this.

00:12:14.283 --> 00:12:16.855
Why couldn't he text me or
something?

00:12:16.955 --> 00:12:20.028
He does whatever he
wants. He's so selfish.

00:12:21.263 --> 00:12:24.136
- Well, well fancy seeing you
here.

00:12:27.375 --> 00:12:29.146
What are you doing out this late
at night

00:12:29.246 --> 00:12:30.582
I was starting to get worried.

00:12:30.683 --> 00:12:32.920
I've been waiting for over an
hour.

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:34.524
- [Nana] Oh, I'm sorry , but I
was just

00:12:34.624 --> 00:12:37.997
at the studio watching Nana
rehearse with the band.

00:12:38.097 --> 00:12:39.801
Nana's been sleeping at Ren's
place

00:12:39.901 --> 00:12:41.705
and I was afraid to go home on
my own,

00:12:41.805 --> 00:12:44.242
so Nobu offered to walk with me.

00:12:44.343 --> 00:12:44.911
- Oh yeah?

00:12:45.011 --> 00:12:46.648
Well what a gentleman. Thanks
Nobu.

00:12:46.748 --> 00:12:48.885
- Yes. Thank you Nobu.

00:12:51.858 --> 00:12:53.227
Have a good night.

00:12:55.532 --> 00:12:57.369
How could I do this to him?

00:13:00.108 --> 00:13:02.145
- So I'm sorry for
dropping by unannounced.

00:13:02.245 --> 00:13:04.483
But I left my house without my
cell phone.

00:13:04.584 --> 00:13:06.888
So I couldn't call you or
anything.

00:13:06.988 --> 00:13:08.190
- It's my fault.

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:10.629
I was being sneaky and
took advantage of Nobu

00:13:10.729 --> 00:13:12.633
when I let him walk me home.

00:13:12.733 --> 00:13:14.837
I must have heard his feelings.

00:13:17.275 --> 00:13:18.979
- [Nana] What should I do?

00:13:19.079 --> 00:13:22.753
Now there's really no way
I can go to the studio.

00:13:22.853 --> 00:13:24.991
I can't bear to face him.

00:13:29.466 --> 00:13:31.705
- Um do you want anything? Are
you hungry?

00:13:31.805 --> 00:13:34.076
Do you want me to make you a
snack?

00:13:37.883 --> 00:13:41.223
What about something to drink?
I think we've got some beer.

00:13:41.323 --> 00:13:42.593
- [Takami] Sure.

00:13:42.693 --> 00:13:45.131
- I've got to stay strong.

00:13:45.231 --> 00:13:48.003
As far as Takami's concerned
I'm just an easy lay

00:13:48.104 --> 00:13:50.375
whenever it's convenient for
him.

00:13:51.978 --> 00:13:53.949
I've fallen for it twice
already.

00:13:54.049 --> 00:13:56.921
I'm not gonna make the
same mistake a third time.

00:13:57.022 --> 00:13:58.157
If I don't put a stop to it

00:13:58.257 --> 00:14:02.833
this pathetic non-relationship
is never gonna end.

00:14:02.933 --> 00:14:06.340
And if I'm gonna end
it I've gotta do it now

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:07.510
before I can't turn back

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:11.684
I just have to tell him he
can't come here anymore.

00:14:11.785 --> 00:14:12.987
- Huh?

00:14:14.857 --> 00:14:17.596
But can I really tell him that?

00:14:20.636 --> 00:14:24.042
(light switches on)

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:28.484
(opens beer can)

00:14:28.585 --> 00:14:29.587
- Huh?

00:14:35.064 --> 00:14:36.568
- I can't say it.

00:14:36.668 --> 00:14:37.402
(laughs)

00:14:37.503 --> 00:14:39.106
- Are you gonna drink
that whole thing all by

00:14:39.206 --> 00:14:42.212
yourself? Give some.

00:14:42.312 --> 00:14:44.617
- [Nana] I know he's no good for
me.

00:14:50.896 --> 00:14:53.300
So why can't I break free?

00:14:55.672 --> 00:14:56.841
- [Shin] Huh?

00:14:56.941 --> 00:14:58.979
Hey Nobu how's it going?

00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:07.328
(TV playing)

00:15:09.567 --> 00:15:10.435
- What are you watching?

00:15:10.536 --> 00:15:12.773
- It's porn obviously, I'm doing
research.

00:15:12.873 --> 00:15:14.042
- [Nobu] Well now's not the
time.

00:15:14.142 --> 00:15:16.280
Are you trying to piss me off?

00:15:18.217 --> 00:15:19.720
I can't take it anymore.

00:15:19.821 --> 00:15:21.390
- Can't take what?

00:15:23.461 --> 00:15:24.530
Huh?

00:15:26.568 --> 00:15:27.636
Tell me what happened.

00:15:27.736 --> 00:15:30.241
- Nothing. Leave me alone.

00:15:31.443 --> 00:15:35.151
Sorry. I just need some
time on my own, okay?

00:15:36.921 --> 00:15:41.130
(sad dramatic music playing)

00:15:53.522 --> 00:15:54.256
(door opening)

00:15:54.356 --> 00:15:59.499
- [Nobu] Shin. If a man
and a woman are just objects

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.838
of desire to each other

00:16:01.938 --> 00:16:05.679
than do you think they could
ever be connected by love?

00:16:12.726 --> 00:16:16.300
- [Shin] Sorry. I'm
not sure if that myself.

00:16:17.302 --> 00:16:21.511
(dramatic music playing)

00:16:21.611 --> 00:16:25.619
- [Nana] The truth is I just
wanted to get close Takami out

00:16:25.719 --> 00:16:27.222
of curiosity.

00:16:28.892 --> 00:16:33.300
I'm not as pure as Nana
thinks and I'm most definitely

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:36.240
not the girl next door
that Nobu thinks I am

00:16:37.743 --> 00:16:40.047
but Takami knows me.

00:16:40.147 --> 00:16:42.520
The me that's empty inside.

00:16:44.489 --> 00:16:45.626
And I know him.

00:16:46.895 --> 00:16:48.532
I know he's a player

00:16:51.804 --> 00:16:53.107
- Oh Nana.

00:16:53.207 --> 00:16:54.677
- It's strange.

00:16:56.146 --> 00:16:56.581
He used to live

00:16:56.681 --> 00:16:59.554
in a world so far away from
mine,

00:17:04.396 --> 00:17:06.500
but he's the only one.

00:17:06.601 --> 00:17:10.074
The only one who can
forgive me for what I am.

00:17:10.174 --> 00:17:11.644
My partner in crime.

00:17:18.090 --> 00:17:21.163
(phone ringing)

00:17:26.541 --> 00:17:28.778
- [Nana] Thanks for looking out
for me.

00:17:28.878 --> 00:17:29.747
Takami me came over last night

00:17:29.847 --> 00:17:33.187
and said he wants to hang
out with me all day tomorrow,

00:17:33.287 --> 00:17:35.091
but I've gotta go to work.

00:17:35.191 --> 00:17:37.930
I shouldn't have signed
up for so many shifts.

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:39.499
When are you coming back?

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:42.906
You're probably rehearsing
like mad for the concert.

00:17:43.007 --> 00:17:43.775
I don't wanna get in the way,

00:17:43.875 --> 00:17:47.282
so I probably won't be
dropping by the studio

00:17:47.382 --> 00:17:49.520
but good luck with everything.

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:52.826
Say hi to everyone for me,
Hachiko.

00:17:57.201 --> 00:18:00.308
- [Nana] Trap nest two
week break came to an end

00:18:00.408 --> 00:18:03.280
but Nana didn't come back home.

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:07.923
I just assumed she decided
to spend more time with Ren.

00:18:08.023 --> 00:18:10.428
I wanted to go to the studio to
see her

00:18:10.529 --> 00:18:12.700
but I didn't have the guts to
face Nobu

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.469
after what I did to him.

00:18:18.678 --> 00:18:22.418
- [Nana] I didn't hear a
thing from Takami as usual

00:18:22.519 --> 00:18:24.991
but I didn't really mind
deep down in my heart.

00:18:25.091 --> 00:18:27.763
I figured he'd show up
eventually.

00:18:27.863 --> 00:18:30.001
I don't know why it didn't
bother me.

00:18:30.101 --> 00:18:31.269
Was it cause I trusted him

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:34.309
or was it cause I was giving up
on him.

00:18:36.948 --> 00:18:37.850
- [Nana] Misato!

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:39.185
- Huh?

00:18:40.889 --> 00:18:42.458
- Thank you so much for
coming out to meet me.

00:18:42.559 --> 00:18:44.429
That was really nice of you,
Miss Komatsu.

00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:46.934
- [Hachiko] No problem , and
you can call me Hachiko.

00:18:47.035 --> 00:18:48.303
- Oh, what a cute nickname.

00:18:48.404 --> 00:18:49.472
It totally suits you.

00:18:49.573 --> 00:18:51.476
- [Hachiko] We've still got
some time before the concert,

00:18:51.577 --> 00:18:54.817
so let's go home and drop
your stuff off, okay?.

00:18:54.917 --> 00:18:56.153
Here. Let me help you.

00:18:56.253 --> 00:18:57.756
- That's very nice of you. Thank
you.

00:18:57.856 --> 00:18:59.326
- [Misato] Are you sure you
don't mind me

00:18:59.426 --> 00:19:00.529
staying at your place again?

00:19:00.629 --> 00:19:03.935
- [Hachiko] Of course not. You
can stay as long as you want.

00:19:04.035 --> 00:19:06.139
So you're on summer break now,
right?

00:19:06.239 --> 00:19:07.041
- [Misato] Yeah.

00:19:07.141 --> 00:19:08.545
To be honest, I'd love to spend
the rest

00:19:08.645 --> 00:19:10.314
of my summer break here in
Tokyo,

00:19:10.414 --> 00:19:12.285
but I couldn't possibly stay
with you for the whole month,

00:19:12.385 --> 00:19:14.389
cause that will be imposing
on you way too much.

00:19:14.489 --> 00:19:15.959
- Are you kidding? It's
totally cool with me.

00:19:16.059 --> 00:19:18.531
If you spend the summer here,
actually I want you to stay.

00:19:18.631 --> 00:19:19.499
- Are you sure about that?

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:21.169
This is gonna be awesome.

00:19:21.269 --> 00:19:23.508
- We're gonna have a great
summer.

00:19:23.608 --> 00:19:25.612
Nana's been staying over at
Ren's place

00:19:25.712 --> 00:19:27.415
and I don't know when she's
coming back.

00:19:27.516 --> 00:19:30.789
So it's been kind of lonely
in the apartment on my own.

00:19:32.492 --> 00:19:35.331
- I had no idea Nana and Ren
were back together again.

00:19:35.431 --> 00:19:38.070
That's wonderful news.
I'm so happy for them.

00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:39.940
- Oh me and my big mouth.

00:19:40.041 --> 00:19:40.942
I assumed you already knew.

00:19:41.043 --> 00:19:43.013
You seemed to know everything
else there is to know

00:19:43.113 --> 00:19:43.948
about blast.

00:19:44.049 --> 00:19:46.821
- [Misato] Well, back when they
still lived in my hometown,

00:19:46.921 --> 00:19:49.593
I did know that they were living
together.

00:19:49.693 --> 00:19:51.831
After they left I wondered what
happened

00:19:51.931 --> 00:19:53.333
between the two of them.

00:19:53.434 --> 00:19:54.770
I'm so glad they're together.

00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:57.075
- Promise me you won't tell
anyone please.

00:19:57.175 --> 00:19:58.010
- Of course I won't.

00:19:58.110 --> 00:20:01.416
You can count on me to
keep a secret Miss Hachiko.

00:20:06.093 --> 00:20:08.263
The concert starts at seven,
right?

00:20:08.363 --> 00:20:11.103
I can't wait to see all
the guys in the band again.

00:20:11.203 --> 00:20:13.040
- They're probably rehearsing
right now.

00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:14.342
I hope it's going well.

00:20:14.442 --> 00:20:15.812
I haven't seen them for a week.

00:20:15.912 --> 00:20:18.350
- Oh, but I thought you went
to the studio every day to

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:20.454
watch them practice. What
happened?

00:20:20.555 --> 00:20:23.160
- I didn't wanna bother them
before such a big concert.

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:24.062
I'd just get in the way.

00:20:24.162 --> 00:20:25.599
- Oh yeah. That makes sense.

00:20:25.699 --> 00:20:26.768
Wouldn't it be so great if

00:20:26.868 --> 00:20:29.439
Blast got signed to a record
deal?

00:20:34.048 --> 00:20:37.121
- [Hachiko] What'll happen
when I see Nobu tonight?

00:20:37.221 --> 00:20:39.192
How can I face him?

00:20:39.292 --> 00:20:43.735
(romantic music playing)

00:20:43.835 --> 00:20:46.808
- [Hachiko] What if he won't
even smile at me anymore?

00:20:49.847 --> 00:20:53.655
Even the thought of
that makes me wanna cry.

00:20:57.963 --> 00:21:01.436
It was that song that
Nobu wrote on that night

00:21:01.537 --> 00:21:03.440
when we were singing with Nana,

00:21:03.541 --> 00:21:07.448
you were wishing for something,
you were pushing your voice,

00:21:07.549 --> 00:21:09.252
so it could reach me.

00:21:11.691 --> 00:21:14.462
I can understand that now.
