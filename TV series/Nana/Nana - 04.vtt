WEBVTT

00:00:03.624 --> 00:00:04.893
- [Shoji] Nana!

00:00:07.999 --> 00:00:11.072
(Shoji panting)

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.112
- [Nana] Shoji.

00:00:19.188 --> 00:00:20.491
Hold me.

00:00:20.592 --> 00:00:22.094
Just hold me.

00:00:22.194 --> 00:00:24.098
- (giggles) What's with that
face?

00:00:24.198 --> 00:00:24.900
- Huh?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.169
- I wanted to apologize.

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:28.206
I guess I said things I
shouldn't have.

00:00:28.306 --> 00:00:30.144
Let's just forget about it.

00:00:30.244 --> 00:00:31.112
(groans)

00:00:31.212 --> 00:00:34.252
- [Nana] Well that sure killed
the mood.

00:00:34.352 --> 00:00:37.058
(rock music)

00:02:15.855 --> 00:02:16.389
- Welcome back.

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.661
- Jun, you've gotta hear
this. You know what Shoji did?

00:02:18.761 --> 00:02:19.997
Mm?

00:02:20.097 --> 00:02:21.332
- Good night.

00:02:22.001 --> 00:02:23.538
- Huh?

00:02:23.638 --> 00:02:27.546
- Unlucky room 707. What
have I done to deserve this?

00:02:27.646 --> 00:02:30.718
- Why are you talking
to yourself? It's weird.

00:02:30.818 --> 00:02:31.452
- I'm not talking to myself.

00:02:31.554 --> 00:02:33.925
If you must know, I'm
talking to the demon lord.

00:02:34.025 --> 00:02:35.327
- That's even weirder!

00:02:35.427 --> 00:02:38.834
(sighs) I'm exhausted from
all that running around.

00:02:38.935 --> 00:02:40.705
You really are a lot of trouble.

00:02:40.805 --> 00:02:41.272
- Look who's talking.

00:02:41.372 --> 00:02:44.045
You're the one who went and
ditched me.

00:02:48.955 --> 00:02:51.827
Why are we being so mean
to each other?

00:02:51.927 --> 00:02:54.432
I should be nicer to
the guy I like.

00:02:55.902 --> 00:02:57.471
I hate this.

00:03:00.177 --> 00:03:02.248
Maybe it's too late now.

00:03:03.316 --> 00:03:06.590
I pushed Shoji away from me.

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.794
Here we are sleeping in the
same room

00:03:08.895 --> 00:03:12.936
and there's none of that nervous
anticipation between us.

00:03:13.036 --> 00:03:14.338
He just looks bored.

00:03:14.438 --> 00:03:15.708
- [Shoji] You know what, Nana?

00:03:15.808 --> 00:03:17.244
- Huh?

00:03:17.344 --> 00:03:22.589
- The truth is I want you
to move to Tokyo with me.

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:25.962
But it doesn't make any sense
when I don't have a job.

00:03:26.062 --> 00:03:27.566
I'm not even a college
student yet.

00:03:27.666 --> 00:03:29.870
There's no way I could
support you.

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.005
If you needed something,

00:03:31.105 --> 00:03:33.176
even if it was a matter of
life and death,

00:03:33.276 --> 00:03:34.580
there wouldn't be much I
could do.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.186
That sort of thing is
hard for a man to deal with.

00:03:38.286 --> 00:03:40.123
You've gotta understand.

00:03:42.428 --> 00:03:44.733
- Okay, then I'll go home,
find some work,

00:03:44.833 --> 00:03:47.471
and save up enough money to
move to Tokyo.

00:03:47.572 --> 00:03:50.945
Once you've passed the
university entrance exams next
year

00:03:51.045 --> 00:03:51.847
I'll come and join.

00:03:51.947 --> 00:03:53.951
You I'll even get myself a job

00:03:54.051 --> 00:03:55.354
so you won't have to support me.

00:03:55.454 --> 00:03:57.191
I'll make it on my own.

00:03:58.126 --> 00:04:00.297
So what do you think of that?

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.438
- I guess I'm gonna have to
pass those entrance exams.

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:06.977
I'll show your demon lord.

00:04:07.077 --> 00:04:10.518
(gasps, giggles)

00:04:10.618 --> 00:04:12.756
All right, well now that
we've got that figured out,

00:04:12.856 --> 00:04:14.893
I don't see why we can't sleep
together.

00:04:14.993 --> 00:04:15.460
- [Nana] What do you mean?!

00:04:15.561 --> 00:04:20.003
How can we sleep together?
We haven't even kissed yet.

00:04:20.103 --> 00:04:22.274
- It's okay if you
don't want to.

00:04:22.374 --> 00:04:24.312
I'm used to holding back by now.

00:04:24.412 --> 00:04:26.115
- [Nana] Whatever happened to
romance?

00:04:26.215 --> 00:04:27.251
To getting in the mood?

00:04:27.351 --> 00:04:28.286
- Nevermind.

00:04:28.386 --> 00:04:29.656
- You mean you're just giving
up?!

00:04:29.756 --> 00:04:33.931
- Well, what do I have to do
to convince you to say yes?

00:04:34.031 --> 00:04:36.503
- I don't know. Hmm.

00:04:38.273 --> 00:04:39.275
If you can tell me you love me

00:04:39.375 --> 00:04:41.112
then I'll consider
sleeping with you.

00:04:41.212 --> 00:04:42.782
- Love?! Come on!

00:04:42.882 --> 00:04:44.987
You can't expect me to
say something like that!

00:04:45.087 --> 00:04:46.089
No Japanese guy would.

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:48.360
- But I've never had
anyone tell me that.

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:49.629
No one in my whole life.

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.533
I just wanna hear
someone say it once.

00:04:51.633 --> 00:04:54.138
- [Shoji] What's the
point if you have to ask?

00:04:54.238 --> 00:04:55.440
- Ah, forget it.

00:04:55.942 --> 00:04:58.480
(Shoji groans)

00:04:58.581 --> 00:04:59.516
- Okay, fine. I'll say it.

00:04:59.616 --> 00:05:02.287
A man's gotta do what
a man's gotta do.

00:05:02.388 --> 00:05:04.926
I'll pretend to be an American
movie star.

00:05:05.027 --> 00:05:06.930
My name will be Michael.
- How's that?

00:05:07.031 --> 00:05:07.464
I'm not gonna sleep

00:05:07.565 --> 00:05:10.237
with some made up foreign
guy named Michael.

00:05:10.337 --> 00:05:12.408
I don't wanna sleep
with anyone, but you.

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:13.544
- Huh?

00:05:16.115 --> 00:05:18.219
I'll make some tea, okay?

00:05:19.556 --> 00:05:23.831
Can I offer you some black
tea or green tea, Michael?

00:05:27.237 --> 00:05:30.611
(melancholy music)

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:50.651
- Nana.

00:05:50.752 --> 00:05:56.597
- Shoji, I know that you
said it. Deep in your heart.

00:05:56.697 --> 00:06:01.840
(sighs) Your heart told me you
love me.

00:06:03.544 --> 00:06:05.815
- So you heard it, huh?

00:06:09.321 --> 00:06:11.927
- [Nana] I wanted to be
in a good relationship.

00:06:12.027 --> 00:06:16.035
Something romantic and dramatic.
Just like in the movies.

00:06:16.135 --> 00:06:18.239
But during the summer,
when I was 17,

00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:20.645
I finally became a woman.

00:06:20.745 --> 00:06:23.951
And I also learned that
men aren't that simple.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.057
Or so I thought.

00:06:27.157 --> 00:06:29.563
But that night was different.

00:06:29.663 --> 00:06:33.470
It felt like my body
was going to melt away.

00:06:33.571 --> 00:06:37.344
(melancholy music)

00:06:37.444 --> 00:06:39.783
- I hope everything worked
out between those two.

00:06:39.883 --> 00:06:41.553
I'm worried about them.

00:06:41.653 --> 00:06:43.456
Still, they shouldn't have
to rely on their friends

00:06:43.557 --> 00:06:45.026
to sort things out and
bring them back together.

00:06:45.127 --> 00:06:48.333
I mean, they're not little
kids anymore, right?

00:06:48.433 --> 00:06:51.139
(Kyosuke snoring)

00:06:51.239 --> 00:06:53.376
I love talking to myself.

00:06:55.313 --> 00:06:56.550
Bedtime.

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:00.858
(melancholy music continues)

00:07:07.672 --> 00:07:13.449
- A woman's life isn't so
bad after all, is it, Jun?

00:07:19.094 --> 00:07:20.531
He's so far away.

00:07:20.631 --> 00:07:21.700
- What?
- Oh, nothing.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.438
I'm afraid this is overdue,
so that'll be 300 yen.

00:07:24.539 --> 00:07:26.042
- [Man] Ah, okay.

00:07:27.377 --> 00:07:29.148
- Hey, Nana.
- Huh?

00:07:29.248 --> 00:07:30.484
- How would you like to come out

00:07:30.585 --> 00:07:31.653
and have dinner with me tonight?

00:07:31.753 --> 00:07:33.891
- Sorry, Mr. Nakamura, but no.

00:07:35.193 --> 00:07:36.229
(Nakamura sighs)

00:07:36.329 --> 00:07:36.864
You should have noticed

00:07:36.964 --> 00:07:39.536
how stunningly beautiful
I was before, too late.

00:07:39.636 --> 00:07:41.974
- [Nakamura] What's the
big deal? It's only dinner.

00:07:42.074 --> 00:07:42.575
- [Nana] Yeah, right.

00:07:42.675 --> 00:07:45.480
- Aren't you lonely with
your boyfriend off in Tokyo?

00:07:45.581 --> 00:07:47.351
- [Nana] Get over yourself.

00:07:47.451 --> 00:07:48.888
- You used to like me.

00:07:48.988 --> 00:07:50.257
- Yeah, whatever!

00:07:50.357 --> 00:07:53.396
(sighs) Maybe I should quit
working there,

00:07:53.496 --> 00:07:55.167
but the pay is pretty good

00:07:55.267 --> 00:07:58.674
and I need to save enough
money so I can move to Tokyo.

00:07:58.774 --> 00:08:00.978
I can't wait until next spring.

00:08:01.078 --> 00:08:04.118
(phone ringing)

00:08:04.218 --> 00:08:06.255
Hello! This is Nana!

00:08:06.355 --> 00:08:09.295
(gasps) Shoji! I'm doing
great, how are you?

00:08:09.395 --> 00:08:15.006
Nana Komatsu, 19 years old,
currently in a relationship.

00:08:15.106 --> 00:08:17.077
Even if it is long distance.

00:08:17.177 --> 00:08:19.481
I'll show you, demon lord.

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:34.378
- I don't know where I was
born. I've never met my father.

00:08:34.478 --> 00:08:35.748
And I haven't seen my mother for
so long

00:08:35.848 --> 00:08:38.086
I've forgotten what she looks
like.

00:08:39.723 --> 00:08:42.795
I moved to the city by
the sea when I was four.

00:08:42.896 --> 00:08:44.966
I was raised by my grandmother
who ran a restaurant

00:08:45.066 --> 00:08:48.674
and who constantly dumped
her cold sarcasm on me.

00:08:48.774 --> 00:08:53.283
Now I'm working my ass off,
polishing the shards of a dream.

00:08:53.383 --> 00:08:56.088
(rock music)

00:09:08.747 --> 00:09:11.620
Hey, guys, good evening.
We're Blast!

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:15.460
(rock music continues)

00:10:08.099 --> 00:10:10.370
(indistinct chatter)

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:14.111
- (gasps) Look! They're coming
out!

00:10:14.211 --> 00:10:14.846
- No way.

00:10:14.946 --> 00:10:17.384
Were you guys waiting out
in the cold this whole time?

00:10:17.484 --> 00:10:19.488
You were such an awesome
audience tonight.

00:10:19.589 --> 00:10:21.225
- [Girl] Nana, you were awesome.

00:10:21.325 --> 00:10:22.361
You're the best.
- Thank you

00:10:22.461 --> 00:10:25.400
- Nana, I have a present for
you.

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.872
- What's this? It's from that
designer?

00:10:27.972 --> 00:10:29.943
Can you afford this, Misato?

00:10:30.043 --> 00:10:32.114
- (gasps) You remembered my
name.

00:10:32.214 --> 00:10:34.084
You remember that I'm Misato.

00:10:34.184 --> 00:10:38.126
- Of course I do. You're
at every single show.

00:10:38.226 --> 00:10:41.132
- I think it was your birthday
last week, wasn't it, Nana?

00:10:41.232 --> 00:10:43.537
I wanted to get you something
special as a present,

00:10:43.637 --> 00:10:44.371
so I got this.

00:10:44.471 --> 00:10:45.741
Happy 18th birthday.

00:10:45.841 --> 00:10:47.512
- Thank you (smooches).

00:10:48.781 --> 00:10:51.252
Cool. I got awesome stuff.

00:10:51.352 --> 00:10:52.722
(Misato shudders)

00:10:52.822 --> 00:10:55.293
- [Nobu] Okay, guys, let's
drink to the great show

00:10:55.393 --> 00:10:56.362
we had tonight.

00:10:56.462 --> 00:10:59.068
- [All] Cheers to us!

00:10:59.168 --> 00:11:02.474
- I gotta say, we kicked at
tonight's Battle of the Bands.

00:11:02.575 --> 00:11:05.581
The place was packed with our
fans.

00:11:06.382 --> 00:11:07.518
I never thought I'd see the day

00:11:07.618 --> 00:11:09.823
when women were screaming for
me.

00:11:09.923 --> 00:11:12.528
- But they all dressed as Nana,
doesn't that freak you out?

00:11:12.628 --> 00:11:16.035
- [Nana Osaki] Wow,
it's a jacket. So cool.

00:11:16.135 --> 00:11:17.003
- [Ren] I bet the girl that gave
you that

00:11:17.104 --> 00:11:19.642
is getting strangled by
the other fans right now.

00:11:19.743 --> 00:11:21.312
- Then that kiss I gave her will
cost her

00:11:21.412 --> 00:11:22.982
in more ways than one.

00:11:23.517 --> 00:11:24.552
- Evil.

00:11:24.652 --> 00:11:25.821
- Hey, refill!

00:11:25.921 --> 00:11:27.525
- Nobu, you've had enough
already.

00:11:27.625 --> 00:11:29.963
You've got your graduation
tomorrow.

00:11:30.063 --> 00:11:32.367
- [Ren] You're not going
to graduation, Nana?

00:11:32.467 --> 00:11:33.269
- [Nana Osaki] Well, excuse me

00:11:33.369 --> 00:11:35.273
for being a high school dropout.

00:11:36.142 --> 00:11:36.943
- It's no big deal.

00:11:37.043 --> 00:11:38.847
I only managed to make
it through junior high.

00:11:38.947 --> 00:11:40.785
- [Nana Osaki] That's
nothing to brag about.

00:11:40.885 --> 00:11:43.724
- And what are you laughing
at, Mr. I'm in Law School?

00:11:43.824 --> 00:11:46.630
- (laughs) Just trying to
imagine Nana

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:48.266
in her high school uniform.

00:11:48.366 --> 00:11:49.068
Did she wear the cute socks?

00:11:49.168 --> 00:11:51.338
- You really wouldn't wanna see
it, Yasu.

00:11:51.439 --> 00:11:53.510
Seriously, she looked totally
scary.

00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:54.813
I couldn't even talk to her.

00:11:54.913 --> 00:11:58.352
- Nobu, you big liar. You
were like a full time stalker.

00:11:58.453 --> 00:11:59.589
You were so annoying.

00:11:59.689 --> 00:12:00.156
- Was not!

00:12:00.256 --> 00:12:02.427
I became friends with you
'cause no one else would,

00:12:02.528 --> 00:12:03.897
and you looked so lonely!

00:12:03.997 --> 00:12:07.270
I was your only friend!
You should be thanking me.

00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:09.274
(laughter)

00:12:09.374 --> 00:12:11.680
Yay, Blast!

00:12:14.719 --> 00:12:16.288
- Let's just leave him there and
go home.

00:12:16.388 --> 00:12:18.092
- He might freeze to death.

00:12:18.192 --> 00:12:19.896
- Eh, probably.

00:12:19.996 --> 00:12:21.767
I'll get a cab and take him back
home.

00:12:21.867 --> 00:12:22.902
- [Nana Osaki] Okay, rich man.

00:12:23.002 --> 00:12:24.404
Good thing you're becoming a
lawyer

00:12:24.506 --> 00:12:26.075
so you can earn even more money.

00:12:26.175 --> 00:12:27.277
- At least we'll know who to
call

00:12:27.377 --> 00:12:29.883
when Nana gets herself
arrested and thrown in jail.

00:12:29.983 --> 00:12:32.120
- I don't need a lawyer!
I won't get caught.

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:33.489
- [Ren] So you have done
something.

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:34.859
- Hey, hold on a minute, Ren.

00:12:34.959 --> 00:12:36.930
Remember that thing we were
supposed to talk about?

00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:40.370
I'm going to tell Nobu.
You better tell Nana, okay?

00:12:42.407 --> 00:12:43.610
- What?

00:12:44.913 --> 00:12:46.817
- The only reason Yasu became a
skinhead

00:12:46.917 --> 00:12:49.354
was 'cause he started
to go prematurely bald.

00:12:49.455 --> 00:12:52.227
- [Yasu] Those who laugh at
baldness go bald themselves.

00:12:52.327 --> 00:12:55.200
(laughter)

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:58.574
- Nothing beats performing
in front of a live audience.

00:12:58.674 --> 00:13:00.678
It's like, oh my God, orgasmic.

00:13:00.778 --> 00:13:02.682
I just lose myself on stage.

00:13:02.782 --> 00:13:04.619
- (giggles) Aren't you the lucky
one?

00:13:04.719 --> 00:13:07.090
- Yep, it was awesome. It felt
so good.

00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:09.696
- Even better than doing it with
a guy?

00:13:09.796 --> 00:13:12.067
- Well, that all depends on the
guy.

00:13:12.167 --> 00:13:17.310
- Ah (giggles).

00:13:17.812 --> 00:13:19.949
(wind gusting)

00:13:20.049 --> 00:13:21.853
God, it's freezing out here.

00:13:21.953 --> 00:13:23.022
- [Nana Osaki] What if I catch a
cold?

00:13:23.122 --> 00:13:26.362
You'd be screwed if I lost
my beautiful singing voice.

00:13:26.462 --> 00:13:29.234
- There any gloves? Why can't
our fans buy useful gifts?

00:13:29.334 --> 00:13:30.905
- There's gonna be something we
can use,

00:13:31.005 --> 00:13:32.675
like a scarf or something.

00:13:32.775 --> 00:13:34.779
- Here's something.
- Huh?

00:13:34.879 --> 00:13:37.885
(wind gusting)

00:13:52.715 --> 00:13:57.023
- [Nana Osaki] Hey, Ren,
remember the first time we met?

00:13:58.727 --> 00:14:00.931
There was a big blizzard
just like tonight.

00:14:01.031 --> 00:14:03.269
- Yeah, I remember.
- Yeah, right.

00:14:03.369 --> 00:14:03.837
- Sure, I do.

00:14:03.937 --> 00:14:06.175
It was one of my shows a
couple of Christmases ago.

00:14:06.275 --> 00:14:08.547
- [Nana Osaki] Two years and
three months.

00:14:08.647 --> 00:14:12.354
- I also remember you were
wearing a sexy red dress.

00:14:12.454 --> 00:14:16.262
- Was I now? You trying to
impress me with your memory?

00:14:16.362 --> 00:14:18.967
- I couldn't forget that
night even if I wanted to.

00:14:19.067 --> 00:14:20.971
You were the worst audience
member ever.

00:14:21.071 --> 00:14:22.642
Totally unimpressed by the gig.

00:14:22.742 --> 00:14:23.276
- What are you saying?

00:14:23.376 --> 00:14:25.848
- You stood right near the
stage just glaring at me.

00:14:25.948 --> 00:14:26.950
Stiff as a corpse.

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:31.560
I was so pissed. I remember
thinking, "What's her problem?"

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:32.795
Then after the show was over,

00:14:32.895 --> 00:14:34.732
Nobu dragged you backstage with
him.

00:14:34.832 --> 00:14:37.304
When we were introduced,
you were so cold to me.

00:14:37.404 --> 00:14:42.748
The only thing you said was,
"I'm Nana," not even a smile.

00:14:42.848 --> 00:14:45.019
Guess you didn't have
anything else to say.

00:14:45.119 --> 00:14:45.955
- [Nana Osaki] There was a lot
going on

00:14:46.055 --> 00:14:48.694
in my life back then,
I was in a bad place.

00:14:48.794 --> 00:14:50.831
- Right, because you
got kicked outta school

00:14:50.931 --> 00:14:52.500
for selling yourself.

00:14:52.602 --> 00:14:54.739
- I did not! It was a setup.

00:14:54.839 --> 00:14:57.344
I was a Virgin till I met you,
ya bastard!

00:14:57.444 --> 00:14:59.147
- Okay, okay. Calm down.

00:14:59.247 --> 00:15:01.251
You know, you get off
about a lot of things.

00:15:01.352 --> 00:15:03.489
So I'm surprised you didn't
stand up for yourself back then.

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:07.264
- [Nana Osaki] I didn't have
the energy so I didn't try.

00:15:07.364 --> 00:15:07.999
- (sighs) Yeah.

00:15:08.099 --> 00:15:10.403
Back then you looked like
you'd been beaten down.

00:15:10.504 --> 00:15:12.173
- [Nana Osaki] Besides,
I wanted to quit school

00:15:12.274 --> 00:15:14.679
and get a job, so
everything worked out okay.

00:15:14.779 --> 00:15:17.183
- Weren't you working for
your mean old grandmother

00:15:17.284 --> 00:15:18.920
at a restaurant back in those
days?

00:15:19.021 --> 00:15:20.156
Wasn't that enough for you?

00:15:20.256 --> 00:15:23.697
Why did you want to go and
get yourself another job?

00:15:23.797 --> 00:15:26.068
- I needed more money,

00:15:26.168 --> 00:15:30.009
because no matter how hard I
worked my grandma never paid me.

00:15:30.109 --> 00:15:31.412
It's nothing to laugh about!

00:15:31.513 --> 00:15:33.215
- [Ren] I know, I know.

00:15:34.652 --> 00:15:36.221
- I told you about it before.

00:15:36.322 --> 00:15:39.027
When I was four, my mother
sent me to my grandma's

00:15:39.127 --> 00:15:41.265
and then she disappeared.

00:15:42.935 --> 00:15:43.904
When my mother gave birth to me,

00:15:44.004 --> 00:15:46.041
she had no idea who
the father was.

00:15:46.141 --> 00:15:48.045
As soon as another guy came on
the scene,

00:15:48.145 --> 00:15:49.849
she ran off and left me.

00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:51.886
Grandma would always tell me
over and over

00:15:51.987 --> 00:15:54.926
that I should never grow
up to be like my mother.

00:15:57.865 --> 00:15:59.602
That's why she never let me wear
a pink

00:15:59.702 --> 00:16:01.171
or red girlish clothes.

00:16:01.271 --> 00:16:03.442
She said, if I dressed like
that, I was being provocative

00:16:03.543 --> 00:16:07.818
and would give the impression
that I was seducing men.

00:16:07.918 --> 00:16:11.091
After my grandma died, I was all
alone.

00:16:11.191 --> 00:16:13.195
So I decided to use the money I
saved

00:16:13.295 --> 00:16:16.736
to buy poor old me and
ice Christmas present.

00:16:16.836 --> 00:16:21.445
- Of course, I bought myself
a sexy, bright red dress.

00:16:21.546 --> 00:16:24.351
I remember making sure I
worked the show that night.

00:16:24.451 --> 00:16:26.021
I was so psyched.

00:16:28.694 --> 00:16:30.196
I hid that red dress under my
coat

00:16:30.296 --> 00:16:32.200
and ran through the blizzard.

00:16:40.551 --> 00:16:45.293
- He was two years ahead of me
at school. He's totally cool.

00:16:45.393 --> 00:16:47.965
I can introduce you to him after
the show.

00:16:48.065 --> 00:16:50.036
- Really, you don't have
to bother with that.

00:16:50.136 --> 00:16:53.008
I just came to see the
concert and have a good time.

00:16:53.109 --> 00:16:54.846
- Come on, I'm sure you'd like
him

00:16:54.946 --> 00:16:56.482
if you'd just meet him
and talk to him.

00:16:56.583 --> 00:16:58.285
He's a lot more together
than your average guy.

00:16:58.386 --> 00:17:00.390
He grew up in an orphanage,
you know?

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:03.897
So he is probably gone through
some really tough times.

00:17:05.099 --> 00:17:07.270
When he was a baby,
he was abandoned

00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:10.209
down in the warehouse
district by the harbor.

00:17:10.309 --> 00:17:11.980
It was like on the news
and everything.

00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:14.184
- Nobuo, you know it's not
nice to gossip

00:17:14.284 --> 00:17:16.756
about other people's
personal lives like that.

00:17:16.856 --> 00:17:18.225
- No, it's totally cool
with him.

00:17:18.325 --> 00:17:20.229
Ren brags about it all the time.

00:17:20.329 --> 00:17:21.398
- He does?

00:17:21.498 --> 00:17:22.233
- He's always bragging.

00:17:22.333 --> 00:17:23.503
There aren't many people
who can say

00:17:23.603 --> 00:17:25.974
they've been in the news since
the day they were born.

00:17:26.075 --> 00:17:26.943
And to top it off,

00:17:27.043 --> 00:17:29.014
he still lives in the
same warehouse district.

00:17:29.114 --> 00:17:31.452
He says living there keeps
him close to his roots.

00:17:31.553 --> 00:17:34.992
What he really wants to do is
become a big, huge rock star.

00:17:35.093 --> 00:17:37.197
He says he's thankful
for his scandalous past

00:17:37.297 --> 00:17:39.502
because of the extra
attention it gets him.

00:17:39.602 --> 00:17:42.006
- Give me a break.
That's so stupid.

00:17:42.107 --> 00:17:44.344
- [Nobu] Why? I think it's
pretty cool.

00:17:44.444 --> 00:17:47.083
- Marketing personal misfortune
for promotional purposes

00:17:47.183 --> 00:17:49.254
isn't cool, it's lame.

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:54.999
(rock music)

00:17:56.468 --> 00:18:00.343
When I saw the guy on
stage, I couldn't move.

00:18:01.679 --> 00:18:04.417
(rock music)

00:18:10.864 --> 00:18:13.469
- [Nobu] He was abandoned
down in the warehouse district

00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:14.605
by the harbor.

00:18:14.705 --> 00:18:16.509
He brags about it all the time.

00:18:17.878 --> 00:18:20.617
(rock music)

00:18:31.104 --> 00:18:33.209
- It's hard to describe in words

00:18:33.309 --> 00:18:35.614
what came over me that night.

00:18:35.714 --> 00:18:39.321
It wasn't as simple as love or
excitement.

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:48.038
More like jealousy mixed
in with envy, and lust.

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:51.445
(rock music)

00:18:56.523 --> 00:18:59.361
I still get insecure every now
and then,

00:18:59.461 --> 00:19:01.766
because it feels like
every day I spend with Ren

00:19:01.866 --> 00:19:03.369
is nothing but a dream.

00:19:04.705 --> 00:19:07.443
(rock music)

00:19:07.545 --> 00:19:09.849
Ren was a glamorous, bright
light

00:19:09.949 --> 00:19:13.289
shining into my boring, mundane
world.

00:19:13.389 --> 00:19:16.228
But no matter how hard I tried,

00:19:16.328 --> 00:19:19.301
he always seemed to be
out of my reach.

00:19:24.745 --> 00:19:28.285
Ah, I wish we could do
it in a bigger place.

00:19:28.385 --> 00:19:31.759
- Yeah, I suppose you're right.
That bathtub's too small.

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:35.032
- I meant where we do our gigs.
We've got a lot of fans now.

00:19:35.132 --> 00:19:37.671
- Sure, go for it.

00:19:37.771 --> 00:19:39.441
- It affects both of us.

00:19:42.581 --> 00:19:45.353
So anyway, what were you
and Yasu talking about

00:19:45.453 --> 00:19:46.656
when we were walking home?

00:19:46.756 --> 00:19:50.831
Looked like a serious
conversation.
Was it about the band?

00:19:50.931 --> 00:19:53.637
- Going bald is
serious for a guy.

00:19:53.737 --> 00:19:55.507
- Hmm.

00:19:55.607 --> 00:19:58.412
- If you won't tell
me, then I'll ask Yasu.

00:19:58.513 --> 00:20:00.517
I'm gonna go take my pill, back
in a sec.

00:20:00.617 --> 00:20:02.588
- [Ren] Can't live
without your fix? Junky.

00:20:02.688 --> 00:20:04.357
- If I don't take my birth
control,

00:20:04.457 --> 00:20:06.663
we're gonna be in big
trouble and you know it,

00:20:06.763 --> 00:20:08.700
especially since you're not
interested

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:09.367
in wearing protection.

00:20:09.467 --> 00:20:11.973
What would we do if we got
pregnant?

00:20:12.073 --> 00:20:13.743
- [Ren] We'd have the baby.

00:20:14.545 --> 00:20:16.683
I worked hard manual labor jobs

00:20:16.783 --> 00:20:17.818
instead of going to high school,

00:20:17.918 --> 00:20:20.189
so I've got some money saved up.

00:20:20.289 --> 00:20:23.362
I'd be fine with us
having one or two kids.

00:20:25.901 --> 00:20:28.907
- It might be fine with
you, but it's not with me.

00:20:29.007 --> 00:20:32.615
Right now, I'd rather play
music and have my own life.

00:20:34.785 --> 00:20:37.056
(thud)

00:20:38.827 --> 00:20:41.666
(wind gusting)

00:20:47.343 --> 00:20:51.084
- Nana, I'm going to Tokyo.

00:20:51.184 --> 00:20:54.558
(melancholy music)

00:20:55.727 --> 00:20:58.566
So you can live your
life however you want.

00:21:00.971 --> 00:21:05.179
(melancholy music continues)
