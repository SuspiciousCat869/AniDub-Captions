WEBVTT

00:00:01.269 --> 00:00:02.639
(soft piano music)

00:00:03.752 --> 00:00:08.494
- Hey, Nana, remember
the first time we met?

00:00:09.731 --> 00:00:14.039
You know how I believe
in things like fate.

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:16.711
Well, I think that was fate.

00:00:16.811 --> 00:00:18.649
You can laugh if you want.

00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:23.592
(phone buzzes)

00:00:23.692 --> 00:00:27.600
Oh, dear god, great Buddha,
demon lord.

00:00:30.639 --> 00:00:33.077
(phone beeps)

00:00:33.177 --> 00:00:34.847
(Nana gasps)

00:00:34.948 --> 00:00:36.885
Yay!
(laughs)

00:00:36.985 --> 00:00:37.987
- Excuse me, can I return this?

00:00:38.087 --> 00:00:40.158
- Hey, Nana, what are you
yelling about?

00:00:40.258 --> 00:00:42.095
- Huh, returning your movie.

00:00:42.195 --> 00:00:44.166
I'm sure this gentleman
would be pleased to help you.

00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:45.468
- Nana, I--

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:47.405
- You're gonna have to deal
with these customers yourself

00:00:47.506 --> 00:00:50.111
because I don't work here
anymore, I'm quitting.

00:00:50.211 --> 00:00:51.146
- Quitting?

00:00:51.247 --> 00:00:53.017
- Thanks for everything
you've done this past year,

00:00:53.117 --> 00:00:54.721
and be sure say bye to the
manager for me.

00:00:54.821 --> 00:00:56.858
Oh, and tell him to
deposit my last paycheck

00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:58.494
straight into my bank account.

00:00:58.595 --> 00:00:59.697
(man groans)

00:00:59.797 --> 00:01:00.599
Take care now.

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:01.701
See ya!

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.373
- But Nana.

00:01:05.709 --> 00:01:08.649
- [Nana] Spring is here,
spring is finally here!

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:13.457
I've waited so long for this.
(laughs giddily)

00:01:13.558 --> 00:01:16.631
I can't wait to see you, Shoji.

00:01:16.731 --> 00:01:20.138
(upbeat rock music)

00:02:37.727 --> 00:02:40.566
(guitar riffs)

00:02:45.375 --> 00:02:47.580
(soft instrumental music)

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.251
- Okay, you guys,
let's drink to Shoji

00:02:50.351 --> 00:02:52.055
finally getting
into college.

00:02:52.155 --> 00:02:53.859
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:02:55.128 --> 00:02:57.933
- Mm.
(chuckles)

00:02:58.034 --> 00:02:58.668
- [Junko] Way to go.

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.042
Good think you kept trying
after failing first time round.

00:03:02.142 --> 00:03:03.612
- Okay, you don't have
to rub it in.

00:03:03.712 --> 00:03:06.383
- Yeah, congratulations,
Shoji, I thought for sure

00:03:06.483 --> 00:03:07.987
you weren't gonna make it.

00:03:08.087 --> 00:03:09.322
(chuckles)
- No kidding.

00:03:09.423 --> 00:03:12.362
- What do you know about it,
Koichi Sato?

00:03:12.462 --> 00:03:13.865
(phone rings)
Huh?

00:03:15.435 --> 00:03:17.172
Hey, Nana, is that you?

00:03:17.272 --> 00:03:18.708
- [Kyosuke] I hope for
your sake it is her.

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:21.815
- [Shoji] You get my text.
(chuckles)

00:03:21.915 --> 00:03:22.516
Yeah, yeah, thanks.

00:03:22.616 --> 00:03:25.021
- Guess he hasn't been
fooling around on her, then.

00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:26.356
(chuckles)
- Who, Shoji?

00:03:26.457 --> 00:03:28.895
Not a chance in hell,
he hasn't got it in him.

00:03:28.995 --> 00:03:33.705
- Yeah, I'm down at the
Jackson with Kyosuke and Junko.

00:03:33.805 --> 00:03:36.644
Yeah, that's right,
same place as always.

00:03:36.745 --> 00:03:39.884
So, what's up with you,
Nana, how's it going?

00:03:43.057 --> 00:03:45.194
- I've been busy packing.

00:03:45.294 --> 00:03:48.367
(Shoji groans)
(mid-tempo instrumental music)

00:03:48.467 --> 00:03:50.371
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

00:03:50.471 --> 00:03:53.979
- Nana, she's on
her way to Tokyo.

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:56.785
- [Both] What!

00:03:56.885 --> 00:03:59.690
(upbeat music)

00:04:02.162 --> 00:04:04.934
(Nana grunts)

00:04:10.445 --> 00:04:12.650
- I'd like a one-way
ticket to Tokyo, please.

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.352
- [Agent] You know there
are delays on all the trains

00:04:14.453 --> 00:04:15.354
because of the snow.

00:04:15.455 --> 00:04:18.260
- That's okay, as long
as I get there.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:23.805
(upbeat music)
(phone buzzes)

00:04:26.376 --> 00:04:29.650
(phone beeps)

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.086
Oh, Shoji.

00:04:31.186 --> 00:04:33.324
- [Announcer] Thank you for
choosing the Tohoku bullet train

00:04:33.424 --> 00:04:34.894
with service to Tokyo.

00:04:34.994 --> 00:04:35.996
We apologize for the delay--

00:04:36.096 --> 00:04:37.867
- Wow, the train's packed.

00:04:37.967 --> 00:04:41.508
I'd better hurry up and find
a seat so I can text Shoji.

00:04:49.456 --> 00:04:52.930
(footsteps patter)

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:58.407
Huh.

00:04:59.844 --> 00:05:01.346
Excuse me.

00:05:04.386 --> 00:05:06.791
Um, um, hello--

00:05:06.891 --> 00:05:12.536
(brakes squeal)
(passengers scream)

00:05:19.216 --> 00:05:22.455
- You okay?
- It's okay.

00:05:22.556 --> 00:05:24.492
- [Nana] What happened,
why did we stop?

00:05:24.594 --> 00:05:25.729
Was there an accident?

00:05:25.829 --> 00:05:27.766
- [Woman In Black] You okay?

00:05:29.369 --> 00:05:31.674
- Uh, yeah, I'm fine, sorry.

00:05:31.774 --> 00:05:34.647
- No, I'm sorry, hope this
didn't hurt you when it fell.

00:05:34.747 --> 00:05:39.222
- I'm fine.
(chuckles awkwardly)

00:05:39.322 --> 00:05:44.299
By the way, is this seat, I
mean, would it be okay if I--

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:46.538
- Go ahead.

00:05:46.638 --> 00:05:50.779
(soft instrumental music)

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:53.552
(lighter flicks)

00:05:53.652 --> 00:05:57.025
- [Nana] She's so
beautiful, and so cool, too.

00:05:57.125 --> 00:05:59.296
There's something
different about her, like,

00:05:59.396 --> 00:06:02.435
she's got this special
aura, so thin,

00:06:02.536 --> 00:06:04.472
and such a pretty face.
(gasps)

00:06:04.574 --> 00:06:05.909
Maybe she's famous.

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:10.151
Those long eyelashes, and her
makeup, it really stands out.

00:06:10.251 --> 00:06:12.055
It looks perfect.

00:06:12.155 --> 00:06:15.896
Beautiful people always look
great, no matter what they do.

00:06:15.996 --> 00:06:19.236
Wow, a designer ring.

00:06:19.336 --> 00:06:21.808
That is so cool!

00:06:21.908 --> 00:06:22.509
(Nana gasps)

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:23.678
- Is the smoke bothering you?

00:06:23.778 --> 00:06:26.851
- No, no, no, that's
okay, I'm fine.

00:06:30.124 --> 00:06:32.596
- We're getting nowhere fast.

00:06:32.696 --> 00:06:36.638
The train, keeps on
stopping like this.

00:06:36.738 --> 00:06:39.075
- [Nana] Really, what am
I gonna do?

00:06:39.175 --> 00:06:40.545
I'm in a hurry.

00:06:41.681 --> 00:06:43.050
- Yeah, that's too bad.

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:46.390
- [Nana] I know what I
could do; I could text him.

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:48.962
(keys beeping rapidly)

00:06:49.062 --> 00:06:50.164
There.

00:06:50.264 --> 00:06:51.166
- That was really fast.

00:06:51.266 --> 00:06:53.470
I'm amazed at how you high
school students keep up

00:06:53.571 --> 00:06:54.807
with all that technology.

00:06:54.907 --> 00:06:56.945
- I'm not in high school,
I'm already 20!

00:06:57.045 --> 00:06:58.213
- Huh!
(laughs)

00:06:58.314 --> 00:07:01.788
Sorry, I never would've
guessed we were the same age.

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:05.094
- She's so cute when she laughs.

00:07:05.194 --> 00:07:07.833
You've got to be kidding, you
don't look the same age as me.

00:07:07.933 --> 00:07:09.302
You can't be 20, I mean,
the way you said

00:07:09.402 --> 00:07:12.576
"you high school students"
makes you seem a lot older.

00:07:12.676 --> 00:07:13.377
(Nana giggles)

00:07:13.477 --> 00:07:14.647
- I guess that's just how I am,
still part

00:07:14.747 --> 00:07:16.818
of the analog world.
(PA chimes)

00:07:16.918 --> 00:07:18.087
- [Announcer] Ladies and
gentlemen, we'll be moving

00:07:18.187 --> 00:07:20.391
again soon but because of
the weather conditions,

00:07:20.491 --> 00:07:22.796
we'll be proceeding
much slower than normal.

00:07:22.896 --> 00:07:25.034
We apologize--
- I can't believe it.

00:07:25.134 --> 00:07:27.940
- How long is it going to
take us to get to Tokyo now?

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.044
- [Woman In Black] So,
what's with the big hurry

00:07:30.144 --> 00:07:30.779
to get there?

00:07:30.879 --> 00:07:33.183
- I've wanted to move to
Tokyo for a long time.

00:07:33.283 --> 00:07:35.989
I'm going to be looking
for a job when I get there.

00:07:36.089 --> 00:07:36.891
- No kidding, so am I.

00:07:36.991 --> 00:07:39.095
- You mean you're
moving to Tokyo?

00:07:39.195 --> 00:07:39.730
- [Woman In Black] Yeah.

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:41.768
- Oh, wow, I assumed
you lived there already

00:07:41.868 --> 00:07:44.372
and you were just coming back
from a tour or something.

00:07:44.472 --> 00:07:44.874
- Ha, a tour?

00:07:44.974 --> 00:07:46.878
- Yeah, like doing
concerts everywhere.

00:07:46.978 --> 00:07:49.015
When I saw your guitar,
I figured you must be

00:07:49.115 --> 00:07:50.418
a professional musician.

00:07:50.519 --> 00:07:51.320
- Oh.

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.658
- [Nana] So, are you in a band?

00:07:54.593 --> 00:07:56.330
- I was in one back at home,
yeah.

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:57.900
- I knew it; that is
so cool!

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.837
Where are you from, anyway?
(phone buzzes)

00:07:59.937 --> 00:08:00.772
Oh, a message.

00:08:00.872 --> 00:08:02.876
No, wait, someone's calling.

00:08:04.346 --> 00:08:06.116
Hello, this is Nana!

00:08:06.216 --> 00:08:07.352
Hey there, Shoji.

00:08:07.452 --> 00:08:10.692
Yeah, we got stuck in the
snow, the train's delayed.

00:08:10.792 --> 00:08:13.163
I don't know when we'll get
there.

00:08:13.263 --> 00:08:14.366
Are you sure that's okay?

00:08:14.466 --> 00:08:17.806
We might not get into the
station till after midnight.

00:08:17.906 --> 00:08:19.877
If you're sure you don't mind.

00:08:21.781 --> 00:08:23.450
That sounds great, thanks.

00:08:23.551 --> 00:08:25.856
I'll call once we know
when we'll arrive.

00:08:25.956 --> 00:08:30.565
Okay, then, by for now.
(phone beeps)

00:08:30.665 --> 00:08:32.736
- So you got a boyfriend
in Tokyo?

00:08:32.836 --> 00:08:35.074
You sure are lovey-dovey
with him.

00:08:36.611 --> 00:08:37.880
Now it all makes sense.

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:40.184
You're going to Tokyo
to be with your guy.

00:08:40.284 --> 00:08:41.521
- No!

00:08:42.188 --> 00:08:43.958
Okay, sorta, maybe.

00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:44.560
(woman laughs)

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:45.762
- Are you are aren't you?

00:08:45.862 --> 00:08:48.067
- Well, he's not
actually from Tokyo.

00:08:48.167 --> 00:08:49.870
We know each other
from back home.

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:52.241
We both went to the same
school together.

00:08:52.341 --> 00:08:55.047
But he wanted to go and study
at an art college in Tokyo,

00:08:55.147 --> 00:08:58.187
so he decided to move
there for that.

00:08:58.287 --> 00:08:59.557
- Why didn't you go with him?

00:08:59.657 --> 00:09:01.561
Seems like the
obvious thing to do.

00:09:01.661 --> 00:09:04.466
- Oh, I wanted to; believe me,
I wanted to.

00:09:04.567 --> 00:09:07.506
But he told me to stay behind.

00:09:07.606 --> 00:09:08.708
- How come?

00:09:08.808 --> 00:09:10.679
- Because I had no idea
what I wanted to do

00:09:10.779 --> 00:09:11.881
and no money to do it with.

00:09:11.981 --> 00:09:14.754
He said I should have some sort
of plan before I left home.

00:09:14.854 --> 00:09:16.758
- That makes sense.

00:09:16.858 --> 00:09:19.897
- So I bit my lip, stayed at
home, and started saving up

00:09:19.997 --> 00:09:21.166
enough money to make the move.

00:09:21.266 --> 00:09:23.705
We made a promise that if
he passed his university

00:09:23.805 --> 00:09:25.909
entrance exams that
I would join him.

00:09:26.009 --> 00:09:29.182
Once I'm in Tokyo, I'll get a
job so I can support myself,

00:09:29.282 --> 00:09:32.054
and that way I don't have
to be dependent on him.

00:09:32.155 --> 00:09:34.727
I can't believe I've been
pouring my heart out like this

00:09:34.827 --> 00:09:36.163
to a complete stranger.
(woman laughs)

00:09:36.263 --> 00:09:38.467
- Nothing wrong with that,
sometimes it's easier

00:09:38.568 --> 00:09:39.637
to talk to stranger.

00:09:39.737 --> 00:09:41.574
Besides, it looks like we're
going to be sitting here

00:09:41.674 --> 00:09:43.143
for quite a while.

00:09:43.978 --> 00:09:46.183
- Yeah, I guess you're right.

00:09:46.283 --> 00:09:48.755
So, then, why don't
I tell you some more!

00:09:48.855 --> 00:09:50.592
To be honest, I've been
dying to talk to someone

00:09:50.692 --> 00:09:51.293
about my boyfriend.

00:09:51.393 --> 00:09:54.098
His name's Shoji, and
he's nice, considerate,

00:09:54.199 --> 00:09:55.000
and a totally cool guy.

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:57.405
Sometimes he can be a bit of
a goof when he opens his mouth

00:09:57.506 --> 00:09:58.474
but that's okay.
(woman laughs)

00:09:58.575 --> 00:09:59.977
- A goof, and you still
like the guy?

00:10:00.077 --> 00:10:01.848
- Hey, how about I buy
us both a beer?

00:10:01.948 --> 00:10:05.254
- Sure, why not?
- Two beers, please.

00:10:05.354 --> 00:10:06.624
(beer can pops)

00:10:06.724 --> 00:10:08.695
- Okay, I think we should make a
toast.

00:10:08.795 --> 00:10:10.431
- Okay, to what?

00:10:10.532 --> 00:10:12.368
- Um.

00:10:12.468 --> 00:10:13.571
Shoji passing his exams.

00:10:13.671 --> 00:10:17.111
- Nah, that's got nothing to do
with me.

00:10:17.211 --> 00:10:19.817
- All right, then, what
about toast to you and me?

00:10:19.917 --> 00:10:21.052
- Yeah, I'll drink to that.

00:10:21.153 --> 00:10:23.056
A toast to two girls who are
the same age

00:10:23.157 --> 00:10:25.394
who happen to be
going to Tokyo at the same time

00:10:25.494 --> 00:10:27.265
stuck on the same train.

00:10:27.365 --> 00:10:29.035
Quite a coincidence, right?

00:10:29.135 --> 00:10:31.306
- Ah.
- And there's one more thing.

00:10:31.406 --> 00:10:32.108
- Huh?

00:10:32.208 --> 00:10:35.649
- A toast to the fact that
both of us are called Nana.

00:10:36.617 --> 00:10:38.487
(cans clink)

00:10:38.588 --> 00:10:40.625
(soft instrumental music)

00:10:40.725 --> 00:10:43.197
- [Nana] Remember the first
time we met?

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.038
A snowstorm blew in out
of nowhere

00:10:47.138 --> 00:10:50.110
and the train moved
along so slowly.

00:10:50.211 --> 00:10:53.818
It took us five hours
to get to Tokyo.

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:57.058
But the time seemed to fly by.

00:11:00.064 --> 00:11:02.636
I talked endlessly about myself,

00:11:02.736 --> 00:11:05.675
so I didn't get to find
out anything about you.

00:11:06.777 --> 00:11:09.884
(soft instrumental music)

00:11:09.984 --> 00:11:11.386
Now that I know you better,

00:11:11.486 --> 00:11:14.827
I'm pretty sure you wouldn't
have said much anyway.

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:26.082
- [Shoji] Nana!
(chuckles)

00:11:27.385 --> 00:11:28.387
- Shoji!

00:11:32.596 --> 00:11:37.739
(bag thuds)
(rapid footsteps)

00:11:37.839 --> 00:11:40.779
(Nana cries)

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:46.924
- Why are you crying, I
thought you'd be happy?

00:11:47.024 --> 00:11:48.895
- Of course I'm
happy to see you.

00:11:48.995 --> 00:11:52.235
- Must have been tough sitting
on that train for five hours.

00:11:52.335 --> 00:11:53.605
- Um-hm.

00:11:53.705 --> 00:11:55.474
It was okay.

00:11:55.575 --> 00:11:56.844
Oh.

00:11:59.349 --> 00:12:00.585
- [Shoji] What's up?

00:12:00.685 --> 00:12:03.691
- I made friends with the
girl sitting next to me.

00:12:03.791 --> 00:12:04.459
- Yeah?

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:08.066
- I don't see her; we got
off the train together.

00:12:08.166 --> 00:12:10.639
I wonder where
she could've gone.

00:12:10.739 --> 00:12:13.578
We didn't even get the chance
to swap numbers and stuff.

00:12:13.678 --> 00:12:15.982
- What's up with that, then it's
not like you're really

00:12:16.082 --> 00:12:18.387
friends with her at all.

00:12:18.487 --> 00:12:20.057
Stop crying, Kyosuke and Junko

00:12:20.157 --> 00:12:22.128
are waiting for us downstairs.

00:12:23.698 --> 00:12:25.535
(Nana laughs giddily)

00:12:25.635 --> 00:12:28.240
- June!
(laughs)

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:32.014
(upbeat music)

00:12:32.114 --> 00:12:34.853
Boy, I can't believe how
different the weather is here.

00:12:34.954 --> 00:12:36.757
- So, what do you want to do
now?

00:12:36.857 --> 00:12:39.162
- We could always go
for a drink.

00:12:39.262 --> 00:12:41.333
- Um, can we do that
some other time, guys?

00:12:41.433 --> 00:12:43.938
I'm dead tired.
- It is one in the morning.

00:12:44.038 --> 00:12:46.209
- [June] That's cool,
let's go straight home.

00:12:46.309 --> 00:12:48.915
- I'm really sorry, I know
you guys went out of your way

00:12:49.015 --> 00:12:49.950
to pick me up.

00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:51.386
- Don't worry about it,
it's no big deal.

00:12:51.486 --> 00:12:53.323
- [Kyosuke] Yeah, besides,
now that you're in town,

00:12:53.423 --> 00:12:56.229
there'll be lots of
time when we can go out.

00:12:56.897 --> 00:12:57.398
(Nana sighs)

00:12:57.498 --> 00:13:00.137
- [Nana] It feels so great
to be here.

00:13:00.237 --> 00:13:03.443
Being together again, it's just
like the good old days.

00:13:03.544 --> 00:13:07.786
But it's more than nostalgia,
I feel safe with them.

00:13:07.886 --> 00:13:10.357
They're like my second family.

00:13:10.457 --> 00:13:14.298
I can't believe I
finally made it to Tokyo.

00:13:18.708 --> 00:13:21.012
- See ya.
- Goodnight.

00:13:22.916 --> 00:13:24.987
(Nana yawns)

00:13:25.087 --> 00:13:27.391
- What are you waiting
for, Nana, let's go inside.

00:13:27.491 --> 00:13:28.528
- [Nana] Okay.

00:13:29.495 --> 00:13:30.699
Wait a minute.

00:13:30.799 --> 00:13:33.838
Is it okay for me to be
staying here with him?

00:13:33.938 --> 00:13:34.740
- [Shoji] Come on in.

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:37.278
Sorry, my place is
a bit of a mess.

00:13:38.046 --> 00:13:39.683
(door closes)

00:13:39.783 --> 00:13:41.119
- [Nana] Sorry.

00:13:41.219 --> 00:13:41.854
- Huh?

00:13:41.954 --> 00:13:43.624
- Hope it's not too much
trouble coming to stay

00:13:43.725 --> 00:13:44.526
at such short notice.

00:13:44.626 --> 00:13:46.997
To be honest, I thought I was
going to be staying with June

00:13:47.098 --> 00:13:49.102
until I managed to find
a place of my own.

00:13:49.202 --> 00:13:51.507
- That would be kind of
awkward though, wouldn't it?

00:13:51.607 --> 00:13:54.412
Now that the two of them
are living together.

00:13:54.513 --> 00:13:55.013
(Nana shrieks)

00:13:55.114 --> 00:13:55.982
- No, way, you're kidding!

00:13:56.082 --> 00:13:57.953
Junko never mentioned
anything to me about it.

00:13:58.053 --> 00:13:59.022
Since when?

00:13:59.122 --> 00:14:00.391
- It just kind of happened.

00:14:00.491 --> 00:14:02.763
Kyosuke was spending
more and more time there,

00:14:02.863 --> 00:14:05.367
and then, eventually,
he moved in.

00:14:05.467 --> 00:14:06.369
(Nana sighs)
- Wow.

00:14:06.469 --> 00:14:08.106
- [Shoji] Hey, come on,
take your shoes off.

00:14:08.206 --> 00:14:08.975
- [Nana] I never
would've guessed.

00:14:09.075 --> 00:14:10.444
- [Shoji] This is
Japan, remember.

00:14:10.545 --> 00:14:12.716
- [Nana] The two of
them are starting to be

00:14:12.816 --> 00:14:14.520
like an old married couple.

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:15.688
- An old married couple?

00:14:15.789 --> 00:14:19.863
- [Nana] Whoever would've
guessed they'd end up like that?

00:14:19.963 --> 00:14:22.669
Oh, it must be so great.
- Now, what?

00:14:22.769 --> 00:14:25.174
- Hey, are you trying to
get me undressed already?

00:14:25.274 --> 00:14:27.946
Pervert.
(loud smack)

00:14:28.046 --> 00:14:31.152
I wonder if Shoji and I
will end up like that.

00:14:32.522 --> 00:14:35.729
I want to make up for all
the time we were apart.

00:14:35.829 --> 00:14:37.364
I'm so happy.

00:14:39.068 --> 00:14:42.542
(soft piano music)

00:14:42.642 --> 00:14:47.519
No, I wanted to get up early
and make breakfast for him.

00:14:47.619 --> 00:14:48.253
(Nana groans)

00:14:48.353 --> 00:14:49.823
(curtains slide)
(upbeat music)

00:14:49.923 --> 00:14:52.428
But I can still work
hard until he gets home.

00:14:52.529 --> 00:14:55.367
(upbeat music)

00:14:57.806 --> 00:15:01.279
Doing all this stuff kinda
makes me feel like I'm his wife.

00:15:01.379 --> 00:15:03.985
Imagine how great it would
be if I helped him like this

00:15:04.085 --> 00:15:06.189
every single day.

00:15:08.326 --> 00:15:10.965
I think I could get into this.

00:15:11.065 --> 00:15:13.905
I'm sure Shoji's going
to appreciate it.

00:15:14.005 --> 00:15:16.176
(doorbell rings)
(Nana gasps excitedly)

00:15:16.276 --> 00:15:17.846
(door bangs)
Hi, sweetie pie!

00:15:17.946 --> 00:15:19.348
- What's up with you?

00:15:21.252 --> 00:15:21.987
- Mm.

00:15:22.087 --> 00:15:23.858
You know, this
actually tastes good.

00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:25.562
- No need for you to
sound so surprised.

00:15:25.662 --> 00:15:27.566
- Let's face it, you
seem like you'd be bad

00:15:27.666 --> 00:15:28.333
at this sort of thing.

00:15:28.433 --> 00:15:30.404
- You never had my food before.

00:15:30.505 --> 00:15:32.341
- I'm just kidding, it really
is good.

00:15:32.441 --> 00:15:34.813
This miso soup is perfect.

00:15:34.913 --> 00:15:35.380
(Nana giggles)

00:15:35.481 --> 00:15:37.151
- [Nana] And it only took
me three hours to make.

00:15:37.251 --> 00:15:39.890
- So how did things go with
the real estate agent today?

00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:41.226
- Huh?
- Did you find a place?

00:15:41.326 --> 00:15:43.731
- I got so busy with everything
else,

00:15:43.831 --> 00:15:45.033
I kinda ran out of time.
- Oh, yeah?

00:15:45.134 --> 00:15:47.873
- Did the job hunting take
longer than you thought it
would?

00:15:47.973 --> 00:15:48.774
Get any good leads?

00:15:48.875 --> 00:15:50.512
- Uh.

00:15:50.612 --> 00:15:53.350
That's right, I gotta
find a job.

00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:55.387
- Or did you stay
in bed all day?

00:15:55.487 --> 00:15:55.855
- No, I did not!

00:15:55.955 --> 00:15:58.326
In case you hadn't noticed,
your apartment is spotless,

00:15:58.426 --> 00:16:00.030
thanks to me and my hard work!

00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:01.934
(chimes tinkle)

00:16:02.034 --> 00:16:03.938
- You spent the day doing what?

00:16:04.038 --> 00:16:06.209
You didn't come all this
way to spend your time

00:16:06.309 --> 00:16:07.144
cleaning my place.

00:16:07.244 --> 00:16:09.650
You promised that if you
came here you'd find a job,

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:11.620
so that way you could
take care of yourself.

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:13.958
- Is that all the thanks I
get after everything I've done

00:16:14.058 --> 00:16:14.793
for you today?

00:16:14.893 --> 00:16:16.564
Thanks a lot, Shoji.

00:16:20.304 --> 00:16:22.474
I shouldn't have snapped at
him like that.

00:16:22.576 --> 00:16:25.013
I don't want to make
him feel bad.

00:16:26.182 --> 00:16:28.754
(silence)

00:16:31.226 --> 00:16:32.629
- Thanks for dinner.

00:16:34.933 --> 00:16:37.672
- Let me do the dishes.
- It's okay.

00:16:37.772 --> 00:16:39.509
- [Shoji] I can do it myself.

00:16:42.816 --> 00:16:45.722
(water splashes)

00:16:48.326 --> 00:16:50.565
- [Nana] I'm pathetic.

00:16:52.001 --> 00:16:55.073
- [Shoji] I'm gonna take a bath.

00:16:58.714 --> 00:17:00.985
(door closes)

00:17:01.085 --> 00:17:02.956
- [Nana] We'll never make it
like this.

00:17:03.056 --> 00:17:07.632
He already hates me.
(Shoji gasps)

00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:15.615
(chimes tinkle)
(soft instrumental music)

00:17:29.543 --> 00:17:31.714
(door opens)

00:17:31.814 --> 00:17:33.216
- [Nana] What am I gonna do?

00:17:33.316 --> 00:17:36.356
How are we ever gonna make
this relationship work?

00:17:37.491 --> 00:17:38.861
(soft instrumental music)

00:17:38.961 --> 00:17:40.732
- Nana.

00:17:40.832 --> 00:17:42.569
Why don't you come
join me in the bath?

00:17:42.669 --> 00:17:45.307
- No way, not a chance.
(whimpers)

00:17:45.407 --> 00:17:47.612
(June chuckles)
- Give me a break.

00:17:47.712 --> 00:17:50.217
Don't you go playing
little-miss-innocent with me.

00:17:50.317 --> 00:17:53.223
- Well, it's embarrassing.
- What's embarrassing?

00:17:53.323 --> 00:17:54.258
- Come on, you know.

00:17:54.358 --> 00:17:56.262
I guess you've forgotten what
it's like seeing each other

00:17:56.362 --> 00:17:58.333
up close and personal
now that you and Kyosuke

00:17:58.433 --> 00:18:00.304
are an old married couple.

00:18:00.404 --> 00:18:01.674
- An old married couple?

00:18:01.774 --> 00:18:04.078
- The bathroom was so
clean and bright.

00:18:04.178 --> 00:18:06.215
He would've been able to see
everything.

00:18:06.316 --> 00:18:07.351
I couldn't do it!

00:18:07.451 --> 00:18:08.420
- Inside voice, please.

00:18:08.521 --> 00:18:11.059
- I don't think I want to
move in with my boyfriend,

00:18:11.159 --> 00:18:13.229
at least not yet.

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:15.167
When Shoji and I started
seeing each other,

00:18:15.267 --> 00:18:17.706
it was a long distance
relationship, so I still feel

00:18:17.806 --> 00:18:20.077
a bit awkward when it's
just the two of us alone.

00:18:20.177 --> 00:18:22.414
We're not really used to being
around each other, you know?

00:18:22.515 --> 00:18:24.586
- That's silly, you guys got
along great

00:18:24.686 --> 00:18:26.255
when you were hanging out as
friends.

00:18:26.356 --> 00:18:27.993
You weren't nervous about being
with him then.

00:18:28.093 --> 00:18:31.432
- It's different now, we're
not just friends anymore.

00:18:31.533 --> 00:18:33.638
Now that we're together,
I don't want Shoji

00:18:33.738 --> 00:18:34.740
to see my bad side.

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:38.480
- Don't you think it's a
little too late for that?

00:18:38.581 --> 00:18:41.587
- Hey, I'm gonna go look for
a place at the rental agency,

00:18:41.687 --> 00:18:42.087
wanna come?

00:18:42.187 --> 00:18:43.991
- Sorry, I gotta work this
afternoon.

00:18:44.091 --> 00:18:47.164
- Can't you skip it, I don't
want to go on my own, June,

00:18:47.264 --> 00:18:48.099
I won't know what to do.
(chair bangs loudly)

00:18:48.199 --> 00:18:49.569
- Stop being such a baby!

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:51.172
You want to live on your
own, you better start

00:18:51.272 --> 00:18:52.441
figuring things out for
yourself.

00:18:52.542 --> 00:18:54.713
You can't have someone
holding your hand every step

00:18:54.813 --> 00:18:56.149
of the way.

00:18:57.351 --> 00:18:58.621
- [Nana] She's right.

00:18:58.721 --> 00:19:02.328
Maybe I can't live with
Shoji, but maybe I can't live

00:19:02.428 --> 00:19:04.700
by myself either.

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:05.735
(horn beeps)

00:19:05.835 --> 00:19:07.304
- You're not gonna find
anything for less than

00:19:07.404 --> 00:19:09.609
50,000 yen a month.

00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:11.947
- I guess if I work hard, I
can afford to pay a bit more

00:19:12.047 --> 00:19:14.619
for my rent, but is there
any way you can help me out

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:17.324
by giving me some sort
of deal on the deposit?

00:19:17.424 --> 00:19:19.462
- [Agent] Hmm, how would
you feel about living

00:19:19.563 --> 00:19:22.836
in an older building?
(paper rustles)

00:19:22.936 --> 00:19:24.438
- They don't want any deposit?

00:19:24.539 --> 00:19:26.810
It's a huge apartment
for that price,

00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:28.380
and we could have pets as well.

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:30.083
- Would you like to take a look?

00:19:30.183 --> 00:19:31.620
- Sure.

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:34.593
(birds twitter)

00:19:34.693 --> 00:19:38.233
- [Agent] Good deals like
this don't come up very often.

00:19:39.903 --> 00:19:42.776
(birds twitter)

00:19:46.416 --> 00:19:50.457
There it is, that brick
building up ahead.

00:19:51.392 --> 00:19:53.764
(upbeat orchestral music)

00:19:53.864 --> 00:19:57.539
- [Nana] It was built a long
time ago, before I was born.

00:19:57.639 --> 00:20:02.481
It looked really elegant and
had that old classic style.

00:20:02.582 --> 00:20:05.888
I fell in love with it from
the moment I laid eyes on it.

00:20:07.859 --> 00:20:10.832
The only problem is that
it's a seventh floor walk-up

00:20:10.932 --> 00:20:13.236
with no elevator.

00:20:13.336 --> 00:20:15.107
But it has an excellent
view of the river,

00:20:15.207 --> 00:20:17.812
perfect for someone like
me who was used to living

00:20:17.912 --> 00:20:18.914
in the country.

00:20:20.183 --> 00:20:22.655
It made me feel at home.

00:20:27.197 --> 00:20:29.335
- So, what do you think,
you like it?

00:20:29.435 --> 00:20:31.540
The view's incredible, isn't it?

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:33.476
It's not easy to find a
place as cheap as this

00:20:33.577 --> 00:20:34.813
with the market
being what it is.

00:20:34.913 --> 00:20:37.552
You really lucked
out with this one.

00:20:41.325 --> 00:20:43.597
(footsteps approach)

00:20:43.697 --> 00:20:45.568
(agent groans)

00:20:45.668 --> 00:20:49.709
(soft instrumental music)

00:20:57.157 --> 00:20:59.996
- [Nana] Hey, Nana, I
remember us standing together

00:21:00.096 --> 00:21:03.303
at the edge of the river,
watching the sun sparkle

00:21:03.403 --> 00:21:04.906
across the water.

00:21:06.008 --> 00:21:08.413
You kept humming this one song.

00:21:09.448 --> 00:21:11.887
Can you sing it to me again?
