WEBVTT

00:00:00.935 --> 00:00:03.508
(slow somber piano)

00:00:04.534 --> 00:00:07.773
- [Hachiko] Takumi, and I
couldn't stop kissing each
other.

00:00:07.873 --> 00:00:12.550
Without saying a word, we
made our way to the bedroom.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.089
I heard Nana, leaving the
apartment.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.664
even though I wasn't
exactly thinking straight,

00:00:19.764 --> 00:00:21.400
in the back of my mind

00:00:21.501 --> 00:00:25.943
I thought she must have
been going to see Ren.

00:00:27.011 --> 00:00:30.318
(pop metal music)

00:02:05.041 --> 00:02:09.517
(traffic commotion)

00:02:11.521 --> 00:02:14.059
- [Shinichi] Hey, Nobuo, let's
go home.

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:16.631
We'll get a cab and I'll
even pay for it.

00:02:17.332 --> 00:02:18.367
(footsteps) (sighs)

00:02:18.467 --> 00:02:20.238
- [Nobuo] You want to go home,
then go.

00:02:20.338 --> 00:02:21.841
- Can I crash with you?

00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:23.110
- [Nobuo] Go to one of your lady
friends.

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.782
- Nah, I don't want to,
I'm not in the mood.

00:02:25.882 --> 00:02:27.218
Takumi, pisses me off?

00:02:27.318 --> 00:02:28.220
Hachi's, our pet.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.091
He shouldn't have stolen her
away from us.

00:02:30.191 --> 00:02:31.460
- She isn't a dog, you know.

00:02:31.561 --> 00:02:33.732
- But it's not fair,
what he's done to you.

00:02:33.832 --> 00:02:35.401
You need to get her back Nobuo.

00:02:35.502 --> 00:02:37.806
You do like Hachi, don't you?

00:02:39.744 --> 00:02:40.311
- I can't.

00:02:40.411 --> 00:02:41.446
- You big coward.

00:02:41.547 --> 00:02:43.117
- There's nothing I can do about
it.

00:02:43.217 --> 00:02:44.720
Hachi's, totally in love with
him.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.292
- But that's just her
being a big fan, right?

00:02:47.392 --> 00:02:48.460
- It might have started off like
that.

00:02:48.561 --> 00:02:50.131
But now that they
actually know each other,

00:02:50.231 --> 00:02:52.736
she's seriously in
love with him.

00:02:52.836 --> 00:02:53.538
Otherwise there's no way

00:02:53.638 --> 00:02:55.374
she'd have let him go
all the way with her.

00:02:55.474 --> 00:02:57.980
- But that was the first day
they met.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.282
How could she be in love with
him?

00:02:59.382 --> 00:03:00.519
(lighter ignites)

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:02.957
She probably just wanted to
sleep him and got carried away.

00:03:03.057 --> 00:03:03.525
(Grunts) (footsteps)

00:03:03.625 --> 00:03:06.363
- How can you talk about her
like that?

00:03:06.463 --> 00:03:08.133
Hachi's, not that kind of girl.

00:03:08.233 --> 00:03:10.605
Takumi, must have worked
his slimy charms on her,

00:03:10.706 --> 00:03:11.574
and she fell for it.

00:03:11.674 --> 00:03:14.179
He duped her into sleeping with
him.

00:03:14.279 --> 00:03:15.549
- You really think so?

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:18.621
Personally, I don't think
Hachi's, that stupid?

00:03:18.722 --> 00:03:21.259
- She isn't stupid, but
she is naive,

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.097
and she's way too honest.

00:03:23.197 --> 00:03:25.267
- [Shinichi] Well, yeah,
I can see that.

00:03:25.368 --> 00:03:26.971
But don't forget how
disappointed you were

00:03:27.071 --> 00:03:28.107
when you finally met Reira,

00:03:28.207 --> 00:03:30.144
and found out what she
was really like.

00:03:30.244 --> 00:03:32.816
You've got some unrealistic
ideas about women.

00:03:32.916 --> 00:03:35.121
Remember, it's not just
men that get horny.

00:03:35.221 --> 00:03:36.356
It happens to women too.

00:03:36.456 --> 00:03:37.893
- Oh, come on, this is Hachi,

00:03:37.993 --> 00:03:38.828
we're talking about here.

00:03:38.928 --> 00:03:40.932
You can't lump her in with all
the sluts,

00:03:41.033 --> 00:03:42.636
you've been mooching off of.

00:03:42.736 --> 00:03:44.540
- Listen, I don't think it's
fair to say

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.878
all the women who wanna
sleep with me are sluts.

00:03:46.978 --> 00:03:48.915
That's being very simplistic.

00:03:49.015 --> 00:03:51.621
Sure, maybe they're being
a little shortsighted,

00:03:51.721 --> 00:03:55.161
but that's only because
they're lonely.

00:03:55.261 --> 00:03:57.398
Hachi, had just broken
up with her boyfriend.

00:03:57.498 --> 00:03:58.835
Maybe she was feeling lonely.

00:03:58.935 --> 00:04:00.137
(Nobuo sighs)

00:04:00.237 --> 00:04:02.375
You didn't make a move,
and so what happens?

00:04:02.475 --> 00:04:05.615
A guy like Takumi, moves
in and takes her instead.

00:04:05.716 --> 00:04:06.918
(Nobuo grunts)

00:04:07.018 --> 00:04:08.187
But knowing Hachi,

00:04:08.287 --> 00:04:09.356
even if this was something

00:04:09.456 --> 00:04:11.026
that happened in the heat of
the moment.

00:04:11.126 --> 00:04:14.332
I'll bet she'll get more
and more attached to him.

00:04:14.432 --> 00:04:16.637
If Takumi, treats her
like all his other women

00:04:16.738 --> 00:04:19.342
it's obvious Hachi's, gonna
get hurt.

00:04:19.442 --> 00:04:22.014
Doesn't it bother you to
think that might happen to her?

00:04:22.115 --> 00:04:24.085
It bothers the hell outta me.

00:04:24.185 --> 00:04:27.191
- (exhales) Hmm.

00:04:27.291 --> 00:04:31.133
(engine revving)

00:04:31.233 --> 00:04:32.703
- [Nobuo] You know, I'm
surprised at you.

00:04:32.803 --> 00:04:33.671
- Huh?

00:04:33.772 --> 00:04:36.410
- You criticize Takumi, for
the way he treats women.

00:04:36.511 --> 00:04:37.579
But the way I see it,

00:04:37.679 --> 00:04:40.418
what you do is just as
bad as what he does.

00:04:40.519 --> 00:04:43.357
I just had no idea you
were so loyal to Hachi.

00:04:43.457 --> 00:04:45.127
- Nah, she's the one who's
loyal to me.

00:04:45.227 --> 00:04:47.432
- Stop talking like she's
some puppy dog.

00:04:47.533 --> 00:04:50.705
- It's just that the women I
know, want something from me.

00:04:50.806 --> 00:04:52.543
They wanna be with me for my
body,

00:04:52.643 --> 00:04:54.145
or they want to have my heart.

00:04:54.245 --> 00:04:55.682
But Hachi's, so sweet to me,

00:04:55.782 --> 00:04:58.420
and she doesn't want anything in
return.

00:04:58.521 --> 00:05:00.491
That's how I know she cares.

00:05:04.299 --> 00:05:06.369
- But when you fall in love
with someone,

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.140
you want everything from them.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.746
It's only natural to
feel that way.

00:05:10.846 --> 00:05:11.881
- Is it, now?

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:16.189
If you want her, then go for it

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:17.425
- Huh? Yeah but,

00:05:17.526 --> 00:05:19.229
I believe it's just like you
said.

00:05:19.329 --> 00:05:20.397
Real love can only happen

00:05:20.498 --> 00:05:22.101
when you want the best
for the other person,

00:05:22.201 --> 00:05:24.640
and never ask for anything in
return.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.615
Well, at least that's
the way I feel.

00:05:28.715 --> 00:05:30.886
I can't take this anymore!

00:05:30.986 --> 00:05:34.025
I just can't forgive
that guy for what he did.

00:05:36.764 --> 00:05:39.068
- I can tell you love her a lot,
Nobuo,

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:40.438
with all your heart.

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:43.845
(car approaching)

00:05:44.947 --> 00:05:46.216
(door opens)

00:05:46.316 --> 00:05:48.020
- [Driver] Hey, your change!
(loud steps)

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.988
(door opens)

00:05:49.088 --> 00:05:50.424
(exhausted breathing)
- [Waiter] Hi, good evening.

00:05:50.525 --> 00:05:52.729
Looking for a table for one?

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.502
(footsteps)

00:05:56.504 --> 00:05:58.006
- [Yasushi] What's going on?

00:05:58.106 --> 00:05:59.342
- Heh?

00:05:59.877 --> 00:06:02.248
(squeaking)

00:06:02.348 --> 00:06:06.189
Sorry, it really isn't that
big of a deal.

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:07.391
- You better tell me.

00:06:07.492 --> 00:06:08.427
Do you know what time it is?

00:06:08.528 --> 00:06:10.030
It's four in the morning.

00:06:10.131 --> 00:06:10.799
Something must have happened

00:06:10.899 --> 00:06:12.335
to make you call me at this
hour.

00:06:12.435 --> 00:06:14.507
So come on, out with it.

00:06:14.607 --> 00:06:16.143
(clanking)
Coffee please.

00:06:16.243 --> 00:06:17.445
- [Waiter] Sure, anything else?

00:06:17.546 --> 00:06:19.449
- [Yasushi] What about
you, you want a latte?

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.321
- No. Nothing for me, thanks.

00:06:22.421 --> 00:06:23.490
- You should get something.

00:06:23.591 --> 00:06:25.529
I'm happy to pay if you're short
on cash.

00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:27.866
Aren't you hungry?

00:06:27.966 --> 00:06:31.641
- Actually, the problem is I
don't have any cash right now.

00:06:31.741 --> 00:06:33.545
- No problem, how much do you
need?

00:06:33.645 --> 00:06:34.713
I don't have a lot on me, but.

00:06:34.813 --> 00:06:36.584
- [Osaki] No, no, it's not like
that.

00:06:36.684 --> 00:06:38.353
I forgot my wallet.

00:06:38.453 --> 00:06:39.623
Once I got here and ordered,

00:06:39.723 --> 00:06:42.729
I suddenly realized I'd left it
at home.

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:44.934
So I called you.

00:06:45.034 --> 00:06:46.469
(laughing)

00:06:46.571 --> 00:06:47.639
Why are you laughing?

00:06:47.739 --> 00:06:49.175
- [Yasushi] So that's all it
was.

00:06:49.275 --> 00:06:51.079
Why didn't you say so when you
called?

00:06:51.179 --> 00:06:53.183
(gasps)

00:06:53.283 --> 00:06:54.419
The way you said help me,

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.389
in such a frightened little
voice.

00:06:56.489 --> 00:06:57.659
I didn't know what to think.

00:06:57.759 --> 00:06:59.830
- I said, I'm sorry okay.

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:01.667
- [Yasushi] It's fine, don't
worry.

00:07:01.767 --> 00:07:04.372
I'm just relieved there wasn't
anything seriously wrong.

00:07:04.472 --> 00:07:06.409
(lighter ignites)

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:09.082
(exhales)

00:07:11.386 --> 00:07:13.357
Come on, let's order something.

00:07:14.526 --> 00:07:16.162
Why are you being so quiet?

00:07:16.263 --> 00:07:18.066
It's not like you at all.

00:07:18.166 --> 00:07:19.168
They've got some cake here.

00:07:19.269 --> 00:07:21.106
Strawberry have some.

00:07:26.416 --> 00:07:27.285
(slurping)

00:07:27.385 --> 00:07:27.753
So you're gonna tell me

00:07:27.853 --> 00:07:29.623
why you're sitting here by
yourself,

00:07:29.723 --> 00:07:31.527
when it's the middle of the
night,

00:07:31.627 --> 00:07:33.631
and you're so close to home?

00:07:35.635 --> 00:07:38.508
You can't fool me, what
happened?

00:07:38.608 --> 00:07:40.845
Did you and Nana, have
a fight or something?

00:07:40.946 --> 00:07:43.016
(sigh)

00:07:47.526 --> 00:07:48.661
- Takumi's over at our place.

00:07:48.761 --> 00:07:50.732
- Huh!

00:07:50.832 --> 00:07:54.372
I came here 'cause I didn't
feel like getting in the way.

00:08:01.019 --> 00:08:03.223
- [Takumi] It's weird
seeing that.

00:08:03.323 --> 00:08:05.862
It doesn't even seem
like that's me.

00:08:08.433 --> 00:08:10.572
Do I really look like that?

00:08:11.373 --> 00:08:12.609
- Huh?

00:08:12.709 --> 00:08:14.112
- Oh, sorry, were you asleep?

00:08:14.212 --> 00:08:16.951
Do you always fall
asleep after doing it?

00:08:17.753 --> 00:08:19.923
It happened last time too.

00:08:20.725 --> 00:08:21.727
- [Hachiko] Not really.

00:08:21.827 --> 00:08:23.665
Last time I was pretending
to be asleep

00:08:23.765 --> 00:08:26.537
'cause you were leaving, and
I didn't wanna say goodbye.

00:08:26.637 --> 00:08:29.710
But this time I know
you're gonna stay with me.

00:08:31.714 --> 00:08:33.317
And what did you just say?

00:08:33.417 --> 00:08:34.352
Sorry.

00:08:34.452 --> 00:08:36.056
- [Takumi] Last time
you were so shy,

00:08:36.156 --> 00:08:38.728
but tonight you were wild.

00:08:39.495 --> 00:08:40.932
So, who's been teaching you?

00:08:41.032 --> 00:08:42.636
- Nobody, honest!

00:08:42.736 --> 00:08:44.840
- I have to say I'm
kind of jealous.

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:47.278
He's nothing for you to be
jealous of.

00:08:47.378 --> 00:08:50.250
- But, don't you have a
boyfriend?

00:08:50.351 --> 00:08:54.560
- What kind of weird question
is that to ask right now?

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:56.797
No, there's no boyfriend.

00:08:57.465 --> 00:08:58.968
- Good, I'm glad.

00:08:59.068 --> 00:09:00.437
- He's glad!

00:09:00.538 --> 00:09:01.807
- [Takumi] But I'm surprised.

00:09:01.907 --> 00:09:04.546
You're so cute, I thought
you'd be dating lots of guys.

00:09:04.647 --> 00:09:06.817
- Oh no, I hardly get
anyone interested in me.

00:09:06.917 --> 00:09:08.755
(lighter ignites)
Unlike you, Mr. Takumi.

00:09:08.855 --> 00:09:11.560
- Drop the Mr. thing please.
(gasps)

00:09:11.661 --> 00:09:13.263
- So what about you?

00:09:13.363 --> 00:09:16.169
You must have lots of
girlfriends wherever you go.

00:09:16.269 --> 00:09:18.006
- Well, no, not really.

00:09:18.106 --> 00:09:18.875
Things never work out.

00:09:18.975 --> 00:09:20.144
- Right, I might be stupid,

00:09:20.244 --> 00:09:22.314
but I'm not stupid
enough to fall for that.

00:09:22.415 --> 00:09:22.849
- [Takumi] Huh?

00:09:22.949 --> 00:09:24.953
That you have girls hanging all
over you.

00:09:25.054 --> 00:09:27.358
- No, that couldn't be
further from the truth.

00:09:27.458 --> 00:09:28.828
I lead a pretty lonely life.

00:09:28.928 --> 00:09:30.464
- You expect me to believe that?

00:09:30.565 --> 00:09:31.600
- [Takumi] Well, to be honest,

00:09:31.701 --> 00:09:33.437
the band has to take priority in
my life,

00:09:33.538 --> 00:09:35.575
and I'm always busier
way on tour.

00:09:35.675 --> 00:09:36.977
I'm terrible at checking
my email,

00:09:37.078 --> 00:09:39.650
and anytime I make plans to
see someone,

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:41.152
I usually have to bail on them.

00:09:41.252 --> 00:09:43.591
So relationships are kind of
difficult.

00:09:43.691 --> 00:09:45.494
Every once in a while I get
some time off,

00:09:45.595 --> 00:09:47.431
and I'll call some girl
up from the past but,

00:09:47.532 --> 00:09:49.703
they usually say, I don't
want anything to do with you.

00:09:49.803 --> 00:09:52.274
- No way, how could they?

00:09:52.375 --> 00:09:55.749
But you can't help it, if
your work keeps you busy.

00:09:55.849 --> 00:09:56.784
- You're the only one who's ever

00:09:56.884 --> 00:09:58.353
understood that Nana.

00:09:58.453 --> 00:09:59.155
That's what makes you special.

00:09:59.255 --> 00:10:02.495
- Well, the truth is I'm a
Trapnest, fan first and
foremost,

00:10:02.596 --> 00:10:03.698
then a fan of Takumi's.

00:10:03.798 --> 00:10:06.336
If you are not working hard
on the music for the band,

00:10:06.436 --> 00:10:07.572
then what's the point?

00:10:07.672 --> 00:10:11.479
- (laughing) Nana, you
really are cute,

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:12.348
you know that.

00:10:12.448 --> 00:10:14.753
(gasp)

00:10:16.456 --> 00:10:19.830
(music box playing)

00:10:21.066 --> 00:10:23.704
(clanging)

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:36.731
Nana,

00:10:37.966 --> 00:10:40.805
I won't lose you to anyone.

00:10:40.905 --> 00:10:43.911
I want you all to myself.

00:10:53.698 --> 00:10:56.269
- [Yasu] So Takumi's,
at your place?

00:10:56.369 --> 00:10:56.971
What for?

00:10:57.071 --> 00:10:58.875
- Can't you guess what for?

00:10:58.975 --> 00:11:01.514
They were making out just inside
the door.

00:11:01.614 --> 00:11:02.883
Hachi, was all emotional.

00:11:02.983 --> 00:11:04.787
- (grunts) What the hell?

00:11:04.887 --> 00:11:06.524
When did they start seeing each
other?

00:11:06.624 --> 00:11:07.391
- I don't know.

00:11:07.491 --> 00:11:08.293
- Oh, come on.

00:11:08.393 --> 00:11:08.961
You must have some idea.

00:11:09.061 --> 00:11:11.934
- When I say, I don't know!

00:11:12.034 --> 00:11:13.538
(gasps)

00:11:13.638 --> 00:11:14.873
But, what can I do?

00:11:14.973 --> 00:11:18.046
It's none of my business who
Hachi, decides to go out with.

00:11:18.146 --> 00:11:19.650
- [Yasushi] Well, I've
got a problem with it.

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:21.720
I don't wanna see
her dating Takumi.

00:11:21.821 --> 00:11:24.593
He's such a womanizer,
it's not even funny.

00:11:24.693 --> 00:11:26.730
- Yeah, well sometimes love
is blind.

00:11:26.831 --> 00:11:28.433
If a girl thinks she's
in love with a guy,

00:11:28.534 --> 00:11:29.503
she's gonna do it with him

00:11:29.603 --> 00:11:30.939
no matter what he's like.

00:11:31.039 --> 00:11:33.911
Even if it means getting
hurt in the end.

00:11:34.011 --> 00:11:35.682
- Well, that's easy for you
to say,

00:11:35.782 --> 00:11:36.784
it worked out
for you.

00:11:36.884 --> 00:11:39.222
- Anyway, we all know
how cute Hachiko, is.

00:11:39.322 --> 00:11:41.894
Takumi, might end up falling
madly in love with her.

00:11:41.994 --> 00:11:45.100
It'd be just like when
Ren, fell in love with me.

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:45.502
(sighs)

00:11:45.602 --> 00:11:48.708
- Yeah, I guess there's the
possibility that could happen.

00:11:48.808 --> 00:11:49.743
But, I don't know.

00:11:49.843 --> 00:11:52.314
- Well, what matters
is, I'm on Hachis, side.

00:11:52.414 --> 00:11:55.788
I was really hoping she would
find herself a new boyfriend.

00:11:55.889 --> 00:11:57.024
So what if it's Takumi,

00:11:57.124 --> 00:11:58.961
she's always had a crush on him.

00:11:59.061 --> 00:12:00.397
I'm gonna support her anyway,

00:12:00.497 --> 00:12:01.634
'cuase she's my friend.

00:12:01.734 --> 00:12:03.170
(smacks)

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:04.840
Still,

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:06.710
why did it have to be him?

00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:09.516
Takumi, of all people.

00:12:09.616 --> 00:12:12.789
- Hmph, you realize you're
not making a lot of sense.

00:12:12.889 --> 00:12:14.893
You're the one who
introduced Takumi, and Nana,

00:12:14.993 --> 00:12:16.597
to each other in
the first place.

00:12:16.697 --> 00:12:17.766
- [Osaki] I know!

00:12:17.866 --> 00:12:19.903
But, I didn't think
the two of them

00:12:20.003 --> 00:12:21.874
were gonna end up in the sack.

00:12:21.974 --> 00:12:24.212
- So, you're telling me
you didn't know

00:12:24.312 --> 00:12:26.517
what kind of reputation
he had with women.

00:12:26.617 --> 00:12:27.384
- That isn't the point,

00:12:27.484 --> 00:12:30.457
I don't give a damn
about his bad reputation!

00:12:30.558 --> 00:12:33.898
- Then why are you so freaked
out about them being together?

00:12:33.998 --> 00:12:36.135
(sighs)

00:12:36.236 --> 00:12:39.275
- Why does Trapnest,
have to keep doing this?

00:12:39.375 --> 00:12:42.481
They're taking away everything
that's important to me.

00:12:42.582 --> 00:12:44.252
(gasps)
(music box starts playing)

00:12:44.352 --> 00:12:48.460
The thing is, I know Ren, and
Hachi, don't belong to me.

00:12:48.561 --> 00:12:50.330
They're people, not possessions,

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:51.299
and it's totally wrong of me

00:12:51.399 --> 00:12:54.071
to even let myself
think of them like that.

00:12:54.171 --> 00:12:56.577
People can spend their time
together,

00:12:56.677 --> 00:12:58.881
but ultimately we're all alone.

00:12:58.981 --> 00:13:01.185
Everyone's got their own
life to live,

00:13:01.286 --> 00:13:04.726
and I know it's impossible
to make someone mine.

00:13:05.895 --> 00:13:07.699
But sometimes that realization

00:13:07.799 --> 00:13:10.203
just makes me feel
even more lonely.

00:13:13.176 --> 00:13:14.312
You know what worries me?

00:13:14.412 --> 00:13:17.886
I really was thinking of
Hachiko, as my pet puppy dog.

00:13:20.758 --> 00:13:22.194
I'm the worst.

00:13:22.294 --> 00:13:23.330
(clanking)

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:24.533
(sips)

00:13:24.633 --> 00:13:26.002
(clanking)

00:13:26.102 --> 00:13:27.204
(sighs)

00:13:27.304 --> 00:13:29.676
(phone rings)
- Hmm?

00:13:29.776 --> 00:13:31.379
- Hmm.

00:13:31.479 --> 00:13:34.352
(Keypad beeps)

00:13:36.089 --> 00:13:37.358
Hmm.

00:13:37.458 --> 00:13:39.362
- Heh.

00:13:39.462 --> 00:13:41.533
I'm going straight
to work from here.

00:13:41.634 --> 00:13:44.005
Why don't you catch
a cab with me.

00:13:44.105 --> 00:13:47.244
That way you could talk this
over some more with Ren.

00:13:50.652 --> 00:13:52.488
(engine revving)

00:13:52.589 --> 00:13:54.693
- [Osaki] I'm sorry Yasu,

00:13:54.793 --> 00:13:58.333
I, sometimes I think I
depend on you too much,

00:13:58.433 --> 00:13:59.536
even though I know it.

00:13:59.636 --> 00:14:00.705
I keep doing it.

00:14:00.805 --> 00:14:01.472
- If you know you keep doing it

00:14:01.573 --> 00:14:04.445
then it's time to grow
up and fend for yourself.

00:14:04.546 --> 00:14:05.347
How am I gonna get a girlfriend,

00:14:05.447 --> 00:14:08.754
when I have you, calling me
at all hours of the night?

00:14:08.854 --> 00:14:09.823
- You're absolutely right.

00:14:09.923 --> 00:14:11.694
I'm gonna try my
hardest to grow up

00:14:11.794 --> 00:14:13.898
before you get back together
with Reira.

00:14:13.998 --> 00:14:15.000
- And what makes you think

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:17.037
I should get back together
with Reira?

00:14:17.137 --> 00:14:20.344
- Because if fate has
anything to do with it,

00:14:20.444 --> 00:14:22.047
everything that's important
to me

00:14:22.147 --> 00:14:23.951
will be taken by Trapnest.

00:14:24.051 --> 00:14:26.322
- [Yasushi] I'm in the same
boat as you on that one.

00:14:26.422 --> 00:14:26.890
- Hmm?

00:14:26.991 --> 00:14:29.061
- First of all, my
girlfriend up and leaves me,

00:14:29.161 --> 00:14:31.366
so she can move to Tokyo
with the band.

00:14:31.466 --> 00:14:34.138
Next, they go and head
hunt my best friend.

00:14:34.238 --> 00:14:36.510
And then there's the
singer in my band.

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:39.415
She's going out with the
guitar player from Trapnest.

00:14:39.516 --> 00:14:41.486
- (gasps) You're so right!

00:14:41.587 --> 00:14:44.458
How can I feel happy about
going to see the guitarist

00:14:44.559 --> 00:14:47.297
of a rival band in the
middle of the night?

00:14:47.398 --> 00:14:47.999
- Oh?

00:14:48.099 --> 00:14:49.836
So, you're happy being with Ren.

00:14:49.936 --> 00:14:51.439
That's good to know.

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:53.243
- Maybe I should go home

00:14:53.343 --> 00:14:53.944
- Go see him.

00:14:54.045 --> 00:14:54.980
- (smacks) Damn it all.

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:56.449
Why is it always like this?

00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:59.656
I bet this has got something
to do with Hachi's, demon lord,

00:14:59.756 --> 00:15:03.496
or maybe Trapnest is actually
an army of demon lords.

00:15:03.597 --> 00:15:04.933
- You know, it's hard to believe

00:15:05.033 --> 00:15:06.737
how much you and Ren, are alike.

00:15:06.837 --> 00:15:08.073
- Huh?

00:15:09.241 --> 00:15:10.678
- Before Ren, moved to Tokyo,

00:15:10.778 --> 00:15:12.014
I remember him saying the kind
of stuff

00:15:12.114 --> 00:15:13.984
you've been saying tonight.

00:15:15.755 --> 00:15:20.565
(somber music)

00:15:20.665 --> 00:15:23.537
- In the end, we are all alone.

00:15:23.637 --> 00:15:26.510
No matter how hard you
try or how close you get,

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:29.583
it's impossible for two
people to become as one.

00:15:33.991 --> 00:15:36.062
- [Ren] I know it's impossible,

00:15:37.498 --> 00:15:41.072
but sometimes I really
wish that Nana, was mine.

00:15:41.172 --> 00:15:45.147
It's like, I want her
all for myself.

00:15:45.247 --> 00:15:48.253
That way I could just slip
her into my jacket pocket,

00:15:48.353 --> 00:15:50.858
and take her with me to
live in Tokyo.

00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:53.964
- Nah, she'd never fit
in your pocket.

00:15:55.133 --> 00:15:57.438
I know this might sound like
a crazy idea,

00:15:57.539 --> 00:15:59.676
but you could just
ask her to come with you.

00:15:59.776 --> 00:16:02.682
- (chuckles) Wouldn't
that be cool?

00:16:02.782 --> 00:16:04.218
I'll give it a try.

00:16:05.721 --> 00:16:07.324
- [Yasushi] Yeah, do it.

00:16:08.928 --> 00:16:12.936
(somber music continuing)

00:16:18.413 --> 00:16:21.385
- [Ren] You can live your
life however you want.

00:16:30.538 --> 00:16:33.476
(footsteps approaching)

00:16:33.577 --> 00:16:36.349
- I'd forgotten you can
see the ocean in Tokyo,

00:16:36.449 --> 00:16:37.552
I like it.

00:16:37.652 --> 00:16:40.925
- It's a pretty amazing
view, wanna move in?

00:16:44.265 --> 00:16:46.737
- Hmm, I'll think about it.

00:16:46.837 --> 00:16:49.175
(sighs)

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:53.183
- [Hachiko] The next day,

00:16:53.283 --> 00:16:54.820
Takumi, ate nearly all the food

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:56.957
I prepared the night before.

00:17:00.898 --> 00:17:02.602
And in the afternoon, he left,

00:17:02.702 --> 00:17:04.706
saying he had work to do.

00:17:05.741 --> 00:17:09.114
(slow piano music)

00:17:12.989 --> 00:17:14.993
I couldn't wait to tell Nana,
everything.

00:17:15.093 --> 00:17:17.866
I wanted to tell her
before all the happiness

00:17:17.966 --> 00:17:20.036
that I was feeling, faded away.

00:17:25.347 --> 00:17:27.117
Nana's, late getting home.

00:17:27.217 --> 00:17:28.587
She told me she didn't have
plans

00:17:28.687 --> 00:17:30.223
for anything special today.

00:17:30.323 --> 00:17:32.929
Maybe she's still over at Ren's,
place.

00:17:33.029 --> 00:17:35.535
But if Takumi, had to
leave to go to work,

00:17:35.635 --> 00:17:37.572
then so would Ren.

00:17:37.672 --> 00:17:39.308
- [Takumi] Well, even
when we get a day off,

00:17:39.408 --> 00:17:41.045
there's still lots to do.

00:17:41.145 --> 00:17:42.749
I'm sorry,

00:17:42.849 --> 00:17:44.451
I'll call you later.

00:17:46.255 --> 00:17:49.295
- Maybe he isn't working
after all.

00:17:49.395 --> 00:17:51.533
(whimpers) No, I have to
believe in him!

00:17:51.633 --> 00:17:53.904
I'm different from all
of the other girls.

00:17:54.004 --> 00:17:56.075
He trusts me 'cause I
understand him.

00:17:56.175 --> 00:17:58.346
(keypad beeping)

00:17:58.446 --> 00:18:01.587
Nana, when are you coming home?

00:18:02.421 --> 00:18:04.391
I've got lots to tell you.

00:18:05.895 --> 00:18:06.930
(doorbell rings)

00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:07.966
(gasps)

00:18:08.066 --> 00:18:09.201
(fast steps)

00:18:09.301 --> 00:18:13.376
(door opens)
Hey, welcome home!

00:18:13.476 --> 00:18:14.311
Ah.

00:18:17.886 --> 00:18:19.990
- Honey, I'm home.

00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:20.925
Isn't that how it goes?

00:18:21.025 --> 00:18:22.662
(laughing)

00:18:22.762 --> 00:18:24.265
- Sorry, Nobuo, it's you!

00:18:24.365 --> 00:18:27.271
I thought it was Nana.
(chuckles)

00:18:27.371 --> 00:18:29.709
- Ah, so Nana's, still out.

00:18:29.809 --> 00:18:30.377
- Mhm.

00:18:30.477 --> 00:18:32.782
I think she must be over at
Rem's, place.

00:18:32.882 --> 00:18:33.584
- Right?

00:18:33.684 --> 00:18:34.886
- Sorry, come on in.

00:18:34.986 --> 00:18:37.057
(footsteps)

00:18:37.157 --> 00:18:38.861
I was just sending Nana, a text.

00:18:38.961 --> 00:18:40.965
Do you want me to call her?

00:18:41.065 --> 00:18:42.535
- Uh, no,

00:18:42.635 --> 00:18:45.340
actually I came here to see you
Hachi.

00:18:46.375 --> 00:18:48.647
I need to talk, to you.

00:18:48.747 --> 00:18:49.883
- To me?

00:18:49.983 --> 00:18:50.585
(clank)

00:18:50.685 --> 00:18:53.791
- No, I don't need to
be drunk to say this!

00:18:55.026 --> 00:18:56.830
- What's going on?

00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:58.634
(sighs)

00:18:58.734 --> 00:19:00.270
Did something happen?

00:19:06.583 --> 00:19:08.721
(gasps)

00:19:12.227 --> 00:19:13.597
(smacks)
(sighs)

00:19:13.697 --> 00:19:15.433
- [Nobuo] I can't do it.

00:19:15.534 --> 00:19:16.970
- Can't do what?

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:17.505
- [Nobuo] I'll come back later!

00:19:17.605 --> 00:19:18.741
- What the hell?
(bonking)

00:19:18.841 --> 00:19:19.509
- I should never have come.

00:19:19.609 --> 00:19:21.045
I can't compete with him.
(door opens)

00:19:21.145 --> 00:19:21.980
What was I thinking?

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:23.182
- What are you talking about?

00:19:23.283 --> 00:19:24.919
Let me help you.

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:26.923
- One of these days,
I'll show him.

00:19:27.024 --> 00:19:28.293
- Show who?

00:19:28.961 --> 00:19:29.796
- Takumi.

00:19:29.896 --> 00:19:32.702
(dramatic music)

00:19:32.802 --> 00:19:35.473
(footsteps)

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:40.417
(crickets chirping)

00:19:43.691 --> 00:19:45.360
(footsteps approaching)

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:45.628
(beeps)

00:19:45.728 --> 00:19:48.299
- [Messenger] You have two new
messages.

00:19:48.399 --> 00:19:49.769
(beeps)
(footsteps)

00:19:49.869 --> 00:19:51.506
- Yo Yasu, it's me Naoki!

00:19:51.606 --> 00:19:52.107
(thud)

00:19:52.207 --> 00:19:54.044
I just left a message on your
cell phone.

00:19:54.144 --> 00:19:55.413
It'd be great to see you
sometime.

00:19:55.514 --> 00:19:56.917
When are you free?
(clanking)

00:19:57.017 --> 00:19:58.486
I can bring Reira, with me.

00:19:58.587 --> 00:20:01.927
Ha ha, call me, see ya.
(crinkling)

00:20:02.027 --> 00:20:03.496
(beep)

00:20:03.597 --> 00:20:04.799
- What's with everyone these
days?

00:20:04.899 --> 00:20:06.435
(lighter ignites)
- My name's Kawano,

00:20:06.536 --> 00:20:08.339
I'm calling from Gaia Music.

00:20:08.439 --> 00:20:10.611
We've had a chance to
review your demo tape,

00:20:10.711 --> 00:20:11.513
and your live video.

00:20:11.613 --> 00:20:15.153
We'd like to set up a meeting
with you as soon as possible.

00:20:15.253 --> 00:20:18.727
(ambient rock music)

00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:22.902
(shuffling)

00:20:24.038 --> 00:20:27.177
- Are you serious, you sure?

00:20:29.314 --> 00:20:32.354
- [Cashier] That comes
to 1,215 yuan please.

00:20:32.454 --> 00:20:34.859
- Here well, why don't you
let me take care of that.

00:20:34.959 --> 00:20:36.530
(smacks)
- It's my stuff.

00:20:37.097 --> 00:20:39.769
(shuffling)

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:43.142
(thud)

00:20:43.242 --> 00:20:45.848
- Mind if we throw this in too?

00:20:45.948 --> 00:20:48.754
(gasps)

00:20:48.854 --> 00:20:52.528
- [Hachiko] Hey Nana, our
lives were so intertwined,

00:20:52.628 --> 00:20:56.703
but still, I didn't
understand you at all.

00:20:58.339 --> 00:21:00.845
I had no idea I was hurting you.

00:21:01.847 --> 00:21:04.184
Please forgive me.
