00:00:05.815 --> 00:00:09.556
- [Nana] I never should
have gotten a cell phone.

00:00:09.656 --> 00:00:11.593
I know I'm the one who's
been staying out all night

00:00:11.693 --> 00:00:15.668
and not telling Hachi,
but she won't even text me.

00:00:15.768 --> 00:00:18.974
She seems to be getting
more and more self-centered.

00:00:19.074 --> 00:00:20.343
It's annoying.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.316
(rock music)

00:00:23.416 --> 00:00:26.790
I don't want to communicate
through some stupid machine.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.330
It only tests the strength
of people's bonds.

00:02:14.238 --> 00:02:17.244
(somber music)

00:02:21.787 --> 00:02:24.559
I haven't been home for nine
days now.

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:29.201
The longer I stay away, the
harder it is to go back.

00:02:31.038 --> 00:02:33.276
But I can't just keep
staying here.

00:02:38.854 --> 00:02:40.725
What am I gonna do?

00:02:55.453 --> 00:02:56.890
I wonder what Hachi's been doing

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.194
all by herself in the apartment.

00:03:02.502 --> 00:03:05.708
Trapnest recording keeps
dragging on and on.

00:03:05.808 --> 00:03:09.314
The band's been crashing
together at the studio's
apartment.

00:03:09.415 --> 00:03:13.089
I'm sure Hachi's been
lonely every day.

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:17.497
I can't imagine that
self-centered jerk contacting
her much.

00:03:20.571 --> 00:03:23.544
But I can't feel sorry for her.

00:03:24.445 --> 00:03:26.750
This is the life she chose.

00:03:29.656 --> 00:03:31.058
- Good morning.

00:03:31.158 --> 00:03:33.329
You sure are up early today,
Takumi.

00:03:33.429 --> 00:03:34.933
Did you manage to get any sleep?

00:03:35.033 --> 00:03:37.505
- No, I was about to take
a nap right now.

00:03:37.605 --> 00:03:40.343
- Ah, you've been working
so hard, haven't you?

00:03:40.443 --> 00:03:41.580
- So how's Reira doing?

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.349
- She's out like a light.

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:44.318
I guess that means

00:03:44.418 --> 00:03:47.390
the medicine the doctor
prescribed is working.

00:03:47.491 --> 00:03:48.627
- Sleeping pills, huh?

00:03:48.727 --> 00:03:49.963
Maybe I should take some.

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:52.835
- So you've been having a
hard time falling asleep too?

00:03:52.935 --> 00:03:55.106
- Well, I bet if I had
you in bed with me

00:03:55.206 --> 00:03:56.208
I could get to sleep.

00:03:56.308 --> 00:03:58.212
- Oh, I'm not like that!

00:03:58.312 --> 00:03:59.448
- So cruel.

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:03.222
This life of abstinence is so
hard I can't take it anymore.

00:04:03.322 --> 00:04:05.728
- Well then, I think you
better finish recording

00:04:05.828 --> 00:04:06.963
as soon as possible.

00:04:07.063 --> 00:04:07.999
- I hope we do.

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:09.268
We're so far behind schedule

00:04:09.368 --> 00:04:11.540
I think Takeda's on
the verge of losing it.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.011
- I bet your fiance's
about to lose it too,

00:04:14.111 --> 00:04:15.246
being so lonely.

00:04:15.346 --> 00:04:16.917
- Actually, it's quite
the opposite.

00:04:17.017 --> 00:04:20.290
She sends me at least 10
text messages every day.

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.427
Stuff like, I knitted socks.

00:04:22.528 --> 00:04:23.831
Sounds like she's having fun.

00:04:23.931 --> 00:04:24.766
- She knit socks?

00:04:24.866 --> 00:04:26.570
- She's getting a head start on
things.

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:29.041
The baby's not due
until next May.

00:04:29.141 --> 00:04:30.443
- Oh, you mean for the baby?

00:04:30.544 --> 00:04:32.147
- Why is it that girls always
ignore

00:04:32.247 --> 00:04:33.483
the really important stuff

00:04:33.584 --> 00:04:36.590
but will continually gab
about the most mundane things?

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.894
That's something I've never
understood.

00:04:38.994 --> 00:04:40.631
- Yeah, whatever you say.

00:04:40.731 --> 00:04:44.506
Please just make sure you send
her text messages too, okay?

00:04:45.106 --> 00:04:46.041
- I do.

00:04:46.142 --> 00:04:47.845
Knit some for daddy, you know.

00:04:47.945 --> 00:04:48.780
- [Mari] Seriously?

00:04:48.881 --> 00:04:50.918
- But what if she really
does knit me a pair?

00:04:51.018 --> 00:04:53.489
They'd probably look just like
the baby's.

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:54.792
- [Mari] You'd have to wear 'em.

00:04:54.893 --> 00:04:56.362
I'd die to see that.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.571
- [Nana] I was hoping that
Hachi would get lonely

00:05:00.671 --> 00:05:02.875
and that she'd miss being with
me.

00:05:04.444 --> 00:05:05.581
(elevator dings)

00:05:05.681 --> 00:05:08.452
- Nana Osaki, yeah,
yeah, I remember.

00:05:08.554 --> 00:05:09.656
The rabbits, right?

00:05:09.756 --> 00:05:10.558
- [Kurada] Huh? The rabbits?

00:05:10.658 --> 00:05:12.260
- Hey, is this thing on, man?

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.764
Is this gonna be shown on TV?

00:05:13.864 --> 00:05:15.701
- [Kurada] No, no, it's
for a magazine article.

00:05:15.801 --> 00:05:16.368
Don't worry.

00:05:16.468 --> 00:05:18.039
- Whatever, man, I don't
wanna get involved.

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:21.312
But are you here 'cause
Osaki did something else?

00:05:46.963 --> 00:05:49.234
- Oh, it was back
in fifth grade.

00:05:49.334 --> 00:05:52.073
One morning all the rabbits
in the science room cage

00:05:52.173 --> 00:05:53.577
were found murdered.

00:05:55.446 --> 00:05:57.752
We all figured Nana
was the one who did it.

00:05:57.852 --> 00:05:59.087
She was morbid, you know?

00:05:59.187 --> 00:06:02.060
She looked like she would
do something like that.

00:06:09.943 --> 00:06:12.582
- [Woman] Nana Osaki really
stood out in junior high,

00:06:12.682 --> 00:06:14.017
but she was antisocial

00:06:14.117 --> 00:06:16.823
so people assumed the
worst about her.

00:06:21.833 --> 00:06:23.604
- [Kurada] Did the other
kids bully her?

00:06:23.704 --> 00:06:25.206
- [Woman] I don't really know,

00:06:25.306 --> 00:06:28.212
but I heard she freaked out
on a senior who harassed her

00:06:28.312 --> 00:06:30.049
and beat him up pretty bad.

00:06:32.555 --> 00:06:33.690
- Osaki, isn't she that girl

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:36.295
who got kicked outta high
school 'cause she was a hooker?

00:06:36.395 --> 00:06:38.934
So, what did she do this time?

00:06:48.019 --> 00:06:50.390
- So I guess you could say
researching her

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:51.425
turned out to be more like

00:06:51.526 --> 00:06:53.830
digging up the sordid past of a
criminal.

00:06:53.931 --> 00:06:57.304
- (laughing) Oh my god,
I just love this girl.

00:06:57.404 --> 00:06:59.408
We'll never run out of
dirt on her.

00:06:59.509 --> 00:07:01.513
- Well I've certainly
had enough of it.

00:07:01.613 --> 00:07:04.151
Why do I have to go and
do this stuff anyway?

00:07:04.251 --> 00:07:05.386
I'm a photographer.

00:07:05.486 --> 00:07:07.625
- 'Cause we're short
staffed, that's why.

00:07:07.725 --> 00:07:10.363
- Can I at least take
the rest of the day off?

00:07:10.463 --> 00:07:12.100
Ren's still locked up
in the studio, right?

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.772
- Yeah, they're only
recording two songs.

00:07:14.872 --> 00:07:16.610
Why is it taking them 10 day?

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:18.513
I wonder if there's trouble
brewing.

00:07:18.614 --> 00:07:19.582
- Excuse me, Chief.

00:07:19.682 --> 00:07:20.818
I just got a call.

00:07:20.918 --> 00:07:22.454
Trapnest has finished recording.

00:07:22.555 --> 00:07:25.259
They're all leaving the
studio and going home.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.163
- Kurata!

00:07:27.263 --> 00:07:30.604
I personally guarantee this
story gets a huge spread.

00:07:30.704 --> 00:07:33.543
That is, of course, if
you get the money shot.

00:07:38.419 --> 00:07:40.490
- So what do you think
of the new song,

00:07:40.591 --> 00:07:43.229
Mr. Matsuo and Mr. Kawano?

00:07:44.532 --> 00:07:45.299
- I like it.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.437
It has a lot of energy
and sex appeal.

00:07:47.538 --> 00:07:48.740
- It's great, I loved every
minute of it.

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.646
- Then you really ought
to let us start recording it.

00:07:51.746 --> 00:07:55.086
And don't you think we need
to decide on an agency soon?

00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:59.494
- (clears throat) We're
all busy getting things set

00:07:59.595 --> 00:08:01.031
for the release of your
first single.

00:08:01.131 --> 00:08:04.237
- Is that tanuki-faced bastard
even doing his job?

00:08:04.338 --> 00:08:06.175
- (laughing) Tanuki!

00:08:06.275 --> 00:08:07.778
- Hey, it's not funny!

00:08:07.878 --> 00:08:09.615
- [Nobu] That's totally
what he's like.

00:08:09.716 --> 00:08:10.483
- [Nana] Are you drunk already?

00:08:10.584 --> 00:08:13.790
- Yeah, but there's no
point in trying, anyway.

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:17.531
- Shin, how serious
are you about the band?

00:08:19.167 --> 00:08:21.271
- [Matsuo] The label isn't
gonna throw money into this

00:08:21.372 --> 00:08:23.610
unless it's a sure shot.

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:26.750
- I heard him say it, Gaia
isn't gonna invest money

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:29.488
into a straight up punk
band like us.

00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:35.333
- Are you serious?

00:08:35.433 --> 00:08:37.370
Who said that?

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:39.074
- [Kawano] I am really so sorry.

00:08:39.174 --> 00:08:42.681
I'm afraid it's my fault there
hasn't been much progress.

00:08:42.782 --> 00:08:45.219
- [Yasu] It's not your
fault, Mr. Kawano,

00:08:45.319 --> 00:08:47.323
our band just isn't mainstream.

00:08:47.424 --> 00:08:49.629
- No, your band isn't
the problem,

00:08:49.729 --> 00:08:51.331
that much. I'm certain of.

00:08:51.432 --> 00:08:52.601
Due to the current recession,

00:08:52.701 --> 00:08:55.641
Gaia's reluctant to take
on any new bands.

00:08:57.444 --> 00:08:57.812
- True.

00:08:57.912 --> 00:09:00.651
It's a difficult time for
bands right now, isn't it?

00:09:00.751 --> 00:09:01.886
- But when you look at Trapnest,

00:09:01.986 --> 00:09:04.024
they managed to ring up
almost three million in sales

00:09:04.124 --> 00:09:06.061
every time they
release an album.

00:09:06.161 --> 00:09:07.665
I guess a big part of
their success

00:09:07.765 --> 00:09:08.834
lies with their vocalist.

00:09:08.934 --> 00:09:11.873
Reira has the image to
ride the diva boom.

00:09:11.973 --> 00:09:16.181
- [Reira] If I can't
see it, I'm worthless.

00:09:16.281 --> 00:09:17.618
- But Nana's got a chance too.

00:09:17.718 --> 00:09:20.490
She's definitely dynamic
enough in her own way.

00:09:20.591 --> 00:09:21.926
So you better not start thinking

00:09:22.026 --> 00:09:24.565
I've given up on you guys, okay?

00:09:25.667 --> 00:09:26.536
- And I can promise you

00:09:26.636 --> 00:09:28.774
that we won't be giving
up so easily either.

00:09:28.874 --> 00:09:32.080
- Well then all I'm asking
for is a little more time.

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:36.488
- The temporary contract
lasts for three months, right?

00:09:36.589 --> 00:09:38.259
We signed that
contract trusting you

00:09:38.359 --> 00:09:40.664
so we'll keep up
our end of the deal, okay?

00:09:40.764 --> 00:09:43.135
- Thanks, Yasu, I really
appreciate it.

00:09:43.235 --> 00:09:45.173
- We're the ones who
should be thanking you.

00:09:45.273 --> 00:09:47.377
I'm just glad that we
have someone like you

00:09:47.477 --> 00:09:48.880
who has faith in us.

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:50.751
- Unfortunately, it takes
more than that

00:09:50.851 --> 00:09:53.222
to make things happen in
this business.

00:09:57.565 --> 00:09:59.869
- But I really don't want
our music to be thought of

00:09:59.969 --> 00:10:03.209
as just a business, devoid
of meaning or feeling.

00:10:03.309 --> 00:10:04.846
It needs to be more than that.

00:10:04.946 --> 00:10:07.383
You have to understand
that both Nana and Shin

00:10:07.484 --> 00:10:08.887
have had the misfortune
of growing up

00:10:08.987 --> 00:10:11.191
without any love in their lives.

00:10:11.291 --> 00:10:14.197
And that's why I don't
want them to believe

00:10:14.297 --> 00:10:16.368
that this world revolves
around nothing more

00:10:16.468 --> 00:10:18.105
than money and greed.

00:10:18.205 --> 00:10:19.909
(poignant music)

00:10:20.009 --> 00:10:22.882
But I'm sure there'll
be times in the future

00:10:22.982 --> 00:10:25.253
when we'll be forced to
think that way.

00:10:25.353 --> 00:10:27.123
So we want someone like you,

00:10:27.223 --> 00:10:30.163
someone who's gonna be
there to back us up

00:10:30.263 --> 00:10:33.135
simply because you
love our band.

00:10:34.872 --> 00:10:36.776
Is that too much ask?

00:10:38.279 --> 00:10:42.153
- Well, you seem to be carrying
a heavier burden than I am.

00:10:42.253 --> 00:10:43.455
- Huh?

00:10:43.557 --> 00:10:45.594
- Allow me to carry half of it.

00:10:45.694 --> 00:10:47.531
Don't try to take on too much.

00:10:47.631 --> 00:10:48.800
If your hands are full

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:50.838
then you won't be able
to do anything

00:10:50.938 --> 00:10:53.175
when you have to make
your own move.

00:10:53.275 --> 00:10:54.311
Here.

00:10:57.016 --> 00:10:59.221
- [Yasu] Hmm, I guess
you're right.

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:20.029
(quiet guitar music)

00:11:24.004 --> 00:11:25.206
- Geez, you're having another
one, Nobu?

00:11:25.306 --> 00:11:27.477
- That's right, what else am I
gonna do?

00:11:27.578 --> 00:11:28.914
The economy's in the toilet.

00:11:29.014 --> 00:11:31.886
Feel like I've just been laid
off.

00:11:31.986 --> 00:11:35.259
- I think you need Hachi to
cheer you up.

00:11:38.365 --> 00:11:41.204
- I guess I shouldn't
blame it on the economy.

00:11:41.305 --> 00:11:42.908
I'm just gonna have to write
songs

00:11:43.008 --> 00:11:45.814
that'll blow away those
guys at Gaia.

00:11:47.317 --> 00:11:48.352
Give me that!

00:11:51.526 --> 00:11:55.032
- Hey, did something happen
between you and Hachi?

00:11:55.132 --> 00:11:58.072
Nobody's been talking about
her at the studio anymore.

00:11:58.172 --> 00:12:01.913
- Shin, ever, ever
mention that name again.

00:12:02.013 --> 00:12:03.516
Even Nobu has a thing or two

00:12:03.617 --> 00:12:05.621
that he doesn't want to
talk about.

00:12:05.721 --> 00:12:06.923
Got it?

00:12:14.337 --> 00:12:17.945
- I meant to ask you, why'd
you buy this acoustic guitar?

00:12:18.045 --> 00:12:19.247
- No real reason.

00:12:19.347 --> 00:12:21.519
I'm taking off. Later.

00:12:21.619 --> 00:12:22.353
- [Nana] It sure is a good thing

00:12:22.453 --> 00:12:25.259
you got so many old ladies
to give you comfort.

00:12:25.359 --> 00:12:27.932
Especially when they buy
you brand new guitars.

00:12:28.032 --> 00:12:29.535
- I bought it myself!

00:12:29.635 --> 00:12:30.236
- Oh, that's right.

00:12:30.336 --> 00:12:32.440
And where did you get the
money from?

00:12:32.541 --> 00:12:33.510
Same diff.
(tense music)

00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:34.712
- [Nobu] Nana.

00:12:34.812 --> 00:12:36.683
- Only spoiled brats
lose their drive

00:12:36.783 --> 00:12:38.085
'cause it's so easy for them

00:12:38.185 --> 00:12:40.222
to get whatever the
hell they want.

00:12:40.323 --> 00:12:42.628
And what do you mean
there's no point in trying?

00:12:42.728 --> 00:12:43.730
Instead of spending your time

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:45.099
fooling around with an acoustic,

00:12:45.199 --> 00:12:47.437
why don't you practice
your bass?

00:12:49.909 --> 00:12:51.746
- You know, I don't think
I should be lectured

00:12:51.846 --> 00:12:53.883
by a singer who can't
quit smoking.

00:12:53.984 --> 00:12:55.252
- What?
- Easy now.

00:12:55.353 --> 00:12:56.823
- By the way, I've been
wondering,

00:12:56.923 --> 00:12:58.660
where did you get your
guitar from?

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:02.300
I mean, you couldn't afford
it just working part-time jobs

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.674
and it's not like you're good
enough to justify playing it.

00:13:05.774 --> 00:13:07.110
- I borrowed it from Ren!

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:09.047
- And what about all your
clothes?

00:13:09.147 --> 00:13:12.821
Last time I checked, they were
all gifts from Misato or Ren.

00:13:12.921 --> 00:13:14.525
(cans clattering)

00:13:14.625 --> 00:13:15.426
(Nana growling)

00:13:15.527 --> 00:13:17.130
- Nana!

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:18.032
- What's wrong with gifts?

00:13:18.132 --> 00:13:20.436
At least I'm not a
prostitute like you!

00:13:20.537 --> 00:13:21.071
- Would you guys just cool it?

00:13:21.171 --> 00:13:23.510
- You're so right, Nana,
you're not like me.

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:26.616
You see I'm one of those
people who work for a living

00:13:26.716 --> 00:13:27.818
but you're just a parasite

00:13:27.918 --> 00:13:30.657
who's living off of Ren's
kindness.

00:13:30.757 --> 00:13:31.859
- Shin!

00:13:43.717 --> 00:13:47.925
There's nothing you can do
about a delinquent like him.

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:51.164
Why are you taking your clothes
off?

00:13:54.505 --> 00:13:55.574
(Nana sobbing)

00:13:55.674 --> 00:13:56.943
- Damn it.

00:14:01.519 --> 00:14:03.188
Is it so bad?

00:14:04.925 --> 00:14:07.765
Is it wrong to accept his
kindness?

00:14:07.865 --> 00:14:10.102
- No, there's nothing wrong with
that.

00:14:10.202 --> 00:14:12.240
Don't you know by now
not to listen to Shin?

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:15.112
He just said all that stuff
to feel better about himself.

00:14:15.212 --> 00:14:18.118
I actually think you should
let Ren spoil you even more.

00:14:18.218 --> 00:14:22.928
You don't wanna let your
stubborn pride drive
everyone away.

00:14:23.462 --> 00:14:26.234
(Nana crying)

00:14:31.044 --> 00:14:34.117
(phone ringing)

00:14:36.856 --> 00:14:37.825
Hey.

00:14:37.925 --> 00:14:38.893
- What's up, dude?

00:14:38.993 --> 00:14:40.897
Sorry to bother you so late.

00:14:40.997 --> 00:14:42.467
Were you asleep?

00:14:42.568 --> 00:14:43.603
- Oh no, I'm still up.

00:14:43.703 --> 00:14:45.406
- Everything okay?
- Mm hm.

00:14:45.507 --> 00:14:47.343
- Really?

00:14:47.443 --> 00:14:50.617
I'm guessing you know
all about Hachiko by now.

00:14:52.921 --> 00:14:54.959
- Well,

00:14:55.059 --> 00:14:57.998
there's nothing I can
really do anymore, you know?

00:14:58.098 --> 00:14:58.967
To be honest,

00:14:59.067 --> 00:15:01.939
I'm kind of out of the
picture at this point.

00:15:02.039 --> 00:15:04.779
- So you're finally able
to face reality.

00:15:04.879 --> 00:15:05.614
Maybe now you can start to see

00:15:05.714 --> 00:15:08.753
what your parents went
through having to raise you.

00:15:08.853 --> 00:15:10.824
- Yeah, you're totally right.

00:15:10.924 --> 00:15:12.961
- Man, you're way too easy.

00:15:13.061 --> 00:15:14.732
It's no fun bullying you.

00:15:14.832 --> 00:15:19.274
- Anyway, look, Nana's over
here at my place right now.

00:15:19.374 --> 00:15:20.610
- Oh, she's at your place.

00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:22.915
I was starting to get worried
'cause she wasn't answering

00:15:23.015 --> 00:15:25.085
whenever I called her cell
phone.

00:15:25.186 --> 00:15:27.591
I didn't get a text from her or
anything.

00:15:27.691 --> 00:15:28.860
- What? Really?

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:31.732
Well, sometimes she forgets to
turn it on.

00:15:31.833 --> 00:15:34.972
You know, after practice,
the three of us sat around

00:15:35.072 --> 00:15:36.909
and had a few beers.

00:15:37.711 --> 00:15:39.849
To tell you the truth, Ren,

00:15:39.949 --> 00:15:43.021
she's been acting kind
weird lately.

00:15:46.027 --> 00:15:47.664
She's always been kind of moody,

00:15:47.764 --> 00:15:51.171
but her mood swings were
never this extreme before.

00:15:51.271 --> 00:15:53.008
She'd just got into a
fight with Shin

00:15:53.108 --> 00:15:55.045
and now she's crying on my bed

00:15:56.014 --> 00:15:58.653
Also, I promised not to tell
anyone,

00:15:58.753 --> 00:16:00.122
but she told me that sometimes

00:16:00.222 --> 00:16:03.095
she can't remember what
she's been doing.

00:16:07.103 --> 00:16:09.240
- Yeah, that's a little weird.

00:16:12.815 --> 00:16:14.017
- Nana.

00:16:14.752 --> 00:16:16.021
Nana, get up.

00:16:18.726 --> 00:16:20.462
At least put your clothes on.

00:16:21.331 --> 00:16:23.603
- Ugh, shut up already.

00:16:23.703 --> 00:16:24.672
Come here if you really are man,

00:16:24.772 --> 00:16:26.609
I bet I've got a few
things I could teach you.

00:16:26.709 --> 00:16:28.580
- Ren said he's coming
over to pick you up.

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:31.218
If he sees you like that he
might get the wrong idea.

00:16:31.318 --> 00:16:33.255
So hurry up, he's gonna
be here any minute now.

00:16:33.355 --> 00:16:34.625
- He doesn't have to get me!

00:16:34.725 --> 00:16:35.259
- Why not?

00:16:35.359 --> 00:16:36.461
Geez, put your clothes on!

00:16:36.562 --> 00:16:38.498
- What if the mosquitoes follow
him?

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:40.469
It's way too dangerous.

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:41.706
- Mosquitoes?

00:16:41.806 --> 00:16:43.643
- Paparazzi have been
following those guys.

00:16:43.743 --> 00:16:47.216
Even Naoki knows about
it so it's gotta be bad.

00:16:47.316 --> 00:16:49.087
- But I'm sure it's fine.

00:16:49.187 --> 00:16:51.291
Ren wouldn't come if he
thought it was too risky.

00:16:51.391 --> 00:16:52.594
- Listen, Ren has no idea

00:16:52.694 --> 00:16:54.999
how much damages a
scandal can cause.

00:16:55.099 --> 00:16:56.802
He never even told me
he was being followed,

00:16:56.903 --> 00:17:00.476
he just kept asking me to
come over to his place.

00:17:00.577 --> 00:17:02.915
The truth is he only thinks
about himself.

00:17:03.015 --> 00:17:07.123
I don't wanna get the media's
attention as only Ren's girl.

00:17:10.029 --> 00:17:11.999
Give him back his guitar for me

00:17:12.099 --> 00:17:14.237
and tell him I won't be
seeing him for a while.

00:17:14.337 --> 00:17:17.043
- Is your pride that
important to you?

00:17:18.613 --> 00:17:22.220
Ren needs you as much
as you need him.

00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:25.359
You're the one who's
thinking only about yourself.

00:17:48.338 --> 00:17:52.246
- Like a moon that's not quite
full,

00:17:52.346 --> 00:17:55.252
that's how I am when I'm with
Ren.

00:17:55.352 --> 00:17:57.858
No matter how much we love each
other

00:17:57.958 --> 00:18:01.164
I don't think there's
anyone who can fulfill me.

00:18:04.103 --> 00:18:06.842
But when I'm on stage,

00:18:06.943 --> 00:18:09.213
that's when I feel complete.

00:18:10.617 --> 00:18:14.658
I have to protect my dream at
any cost.

00:18:14.758 --> 00:18:17.831
Even if it means making
sacrifices.

00:18:21.371 --> 00:18:24.077
I wonder if Hachi's sleeping.

00:18:24.177 --> 00:18:25.580
What time is it?

00:18:27.784 --> 00:18:30.022
Where's my cell phone?

00:18:30.122 --> 00:18:32.694
It's annoying having one,
but I need it.

00:18:36.401 --> 00:18:38.640
Takumi might be in there.

00:18:39.541 --> 00:18:41.411
Wait, this is my apartment.

00:18:41.512 --> 00:18:43.783
What's stopping me
from going in?

00:18:51.699 --> 00:18:54.437
(Nana sighs)

00:19:07.363 --> 00:19:08.866
It's so quiet.

00:19:11.304 --> 00:19:12.708
Is she here?

00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:19.320
She might have Takumi in
there, but maybe she's alone.

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:26.401
Whatever, I don't know anymore.

00:19:26.502 --> 00:19:31.912
(Nana gasps)
(dramatic music)

00:19:45.807 --> 00:19:47.209
What's this?

00:19:51.786 --> 00:19:53.388
What's going on?

00:19:55.727 --> 00:19:58.098
(Nana knocking)

00:19:58.198 --> 00:19:59.735
Hachi?

00:19:59.835 --> 00:20:02.574
(tense music)

00:20:13.663 --> 00:20:16.367
Hachiko, are you in here?

00:20:47.263 --> 00:20:48.900
Hey, Hachi,

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.543
back then, when you kept
losing yourself in love,

00:20:53.643 --> 00:20:55.179
maybe we weren't that different.

00:20:55.279 --> 00:20:55.780
(gentle music)

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:58.986
We both struggled for the same
thing,

00:20:59.086 --> 00:21:00.690
to feel fulfilled.

00:21:02.026 --> 00:21:05.165
I can understand some of
those feelings you had.

00:21:05.265 --> 00:21:08.673
It's just that I
couldn't back then.

00:21:08.773 --> 00:21:12.313
is your new life that you're
protected at all costs

00:21:12.413 --> 00:21:14.651
still fulfilling you even now?
