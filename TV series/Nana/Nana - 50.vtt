WEBVTT

00:00:02.457 --> 00:00:05.531
- [Nana Voiceover] If I saw
everyone again right now,

00:00:05.631 --> 00:00:07.969
I know that I'd depend
on them just as much

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.639
as I did back then.

00:00:13.647 --> 00:00:15.149
I'm scared of that.

00:00:16.185 --> 00:00:18.524
That's why I can't move
from this spot.

00:00:20.026 --> 00:00:21.061
(crackling sound)

00:00:21.161 --> 00:00:24.201
- [Hachi Voiceover] Hey
Nana, the midsummer flowers

00:00:24.301 --> 00:00:27.474
are blooming along the
Tama river again this year.

00:00:28.677 --> 00:00:33.219
We're all waiting for
you in apartment 707.

00:00:35.223 --> 00:00:38.196
I had matching yukata
made for us too.

00:00:38.897 --> 00:00:42.270
(heavy rock music)

00:02:20.734 --> 00:02:24.107
(cicadas chirping)

00:02:27.213 --> 00:02:30.821
(wooden shoes clacking)

00:02:40.073 --> 00:02:43.914
(cicadas chirping loudly)

00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:49.525
(cicadas chirping intensifies)

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.036
(girl gasping)

00:02:55.136 --> 00:02:56.573
(wooden sandal clacking)

00:02:56.673 --> 00:02:57.240
- [Satsuki] Aw!

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.142
(insect wings flapping)

00:02:58.242 --> 00:03:01.816
(wooden shoes clacking)

00:03:04.956 --> 00:03:05.891
- [Hachi] Satsuki!

00:03:05.991 --> 00:03:07.093
- Huh?

00:03:07.193 --> 00:03:10.801
- If you keep dawdling like
that, I'm gonna leave you here.

00:03:11.803 --> 00:03:12.972
- [Satsuki] But Mom!

00:03:13.072 --> 00:03:14.274
I almost got a butterfly!

00:03:14.374 --> 00:03:15.778
A real butterfly!

00:03:15.878 --> 00:03:16.345
- [Woman] Hm?

00:03:16.445 --> 00:03:17.681
- [Satsuki] It was big and
black and really pretty.

00:03:17.782 --> 00:03:21.956
It's a rare one!
I saw it in my book.

00:03:22.057 --> 00:03:22.525
(ashtray clacking)

00:03:22.625 --> 00:03:25.898
- [Yasu] Hm. Sounds like
it was a black swallowtail.

00:03:25.998 --> 00:03:27.133
- [Satsuki] Black swallowtail?

00:03:27.233 --> 00:03:28.537
So it's not a butterfly?

00:03:28.637 --> 00:03:29.839
- [Yasu] No, it is a butterfly.

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:32.243
They just call that type a
swallowtail.

00:03:32.343 --> 00:03:33.880
(paper fan flapping)

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.984
- How is a black swallowtail
different

00:03:36.085 --> 00:03:38.590
from a regular butterfly?

00:03:40.794 --> 00:03:41.495
- Man, oh man.

00:03:41.596 --> 00:03:44.201
The way you talk, Satsuki,
reminds me of Shin.

00:03:44.301 --> 00:03:46.038
I had to explain everything to
him.

00:03:46.138 --> 00:03:47.307
- How come?

00:03:47.407 --> 00:03:48.476
- Well, I suppose you could say

00:03:48.577 --> 00:03:50.480
he was like a six year
old back then.

00:03:50.581 --> 00:03:52.383
(Hachi softly laughing)

00:03:52.484 --> 00:03:54.054
- [Shin] What's that you
were saying about me?

00:03:54.154 --> 00:03:55.390
(Satsuki gasping)

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:57.160
- Shin, You look so dashing.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.864
It really looks good on you.

00:03:58.964 --> 00:03:59.966
- [Shin] Really?

00:04:00.066 --> 00:04:00.634
(sentimental music)

00:04:00.734 --> 00:04:02.437
How are you supposed to
tie this thing anyway?

00:04:02.538 --> 00:04:03.807
- I'll tie it for you.

00:04:03.907 --> 00:04:04.040
- [Shin] Thanks.

00:04:04.141 --> 00:04:06.579
Could you do it in a cool
butterfly bow like yours?

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:08.282
- Yours has to be different,

00:04:08.382 --> 00:04:10.119
and mine isn't called a
butterfly bow,

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:11.388
It's a hana bunko.

00:04:11.488 --> 00:04:14.161
It's how young girls
tie their obi, not boys.

00:04:14.261 --> 00:04:16.198
- Really? Then you can't
wear it either.

00:04:16.298 --> 00:04:18.002
- Why don't you shut up?

00:04:18.102 --> 00:04:19.872
(Shin softly laughing)

00:04:19.972 --> 00:04:22.110
(gentle piano music)

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.519
Tonight is the annual Tama
River fireworks festival.

00:04:27.655 --> 00:04:29.859
No matter how busy our lives get

00:04:29.959 --> 00:04:32.832
or how far away we all
live from each other,

00:04:32.932 --> 00:04:35.938
every year we meet up in this
apartment.

00:04:36.038 --> 00:04:36.573
(heavy footsteps
on stairs)

00:04:36.673 --> 00:04:39.879
Even though we still carry
the same pain inside.

00:04:43.152 --> 00:04:43.954
(metal tab popping)

00:04:44.054 --> 00:04:44.589
(fizzy drink pouring)

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:47.595
- [Nobu] Uh, thanks. That's
enough for me.

00:04:47.695 --> 00:04:51.268
If I drink too much now, I'll
pass out before the fireworks.

00:04:51.368 --> 00:04:53.472
(Hachi softly laughing)

00:04:53.573 --> 00:04:55.744
Yasu, how is it that you
always look the same?

00:04:55.844 --> 00:04:57.748
It's like you're a living
fossil.

00:04:57.848 --> 00:04:58.349
(Shin laughing)

00:04:58.449 --> 00:04:59.519
- It's only been a few months

00:04:59.619 --> 00:05:00.754
since the last time you saw me.

00:05:00.854 --> 00:05:02.490
- [Nobu] No, I mean, you
haven't changed at all

00:05:02.591 --> 00:05:03.727
since high school.

00:05:03.827 --> 00:05:05.229
You know, I bet you'd be the
same

00:05:05.329 --> 00:05:06.633
if you lived a thousand years.

00:05:06.733 --> 00:05:09.404
- But you haven't changed
much either, Nobu.

00:05:09.505 --> 00:05:10.908
You're still as short as ever.

00:05:11.008 --> 00:05:11.876
(Nobu spluttering)

00:05:11.976 --> 00:05:12.745
- Shut up, dude!

00:05:12.845 --> 00:05:13.312
- [Hachi] Nobu?

00:05:13.412 --> 00:05:14.147
Why don't you have a quick
shower

00:05:14.247 --> 00:05:16.485
and then afterwards you can
change into your yukata.

00:05:16.586 --> 00:05:17.855
- Thanks. Good idea.

00:05:17.955 --> 00:05:20.092
But would you mind drawing a
bath for me?

00:05:20.193 --> 00:05:20.861
- All right, all right.

00:05:20.961 --> 00:05:24.334
Your wish is my
command, little boy.

00:05:24.434 --> 00:05:25.904
- Hey, where's Ren?

00:05:26.004 --> 00:05:26.973
Is he coming?

00:05:27.073 --> 00:05:27.675
- [Hachi] He said he'd get here

00:05:27.775 --> 00:05:28.977
just before the fireworks start.

00:05:29.077 --> 00:05:32.150
- That guy always marches
to the beat of his own drum.

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:33.419
- Here you go, Satsuki!

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.122
I got this for you.

00:05:35.223 --> 00:05:36.492
(Satsuki gasping)

00:05:36.593 --> 00:05:37.795
- [Satsuki] It's Yumako!

00:05:37.895 --> 00:05:38.395
- Did you get me one?

00:05:38.496 --> 00:05:39.264
- No way.

00:05:39.364 --> 00:05:40.767
- Mommy, look, it's yumako!

00:05:40.868 --> 00:05:43.205
And she's dressed up in a
yukata!

00:05:43.305 --> 00:05:43.874
(Hachi gasping)

00:05:43.974 --> 00:05:46.278
- It's so cute!
Thanks so much, Nobu!

00:05:46.378 --> 00:05:48.717
I'm completely in love with
this retro doll collection.

00:05:48.817 --> 00:05:50.921
- [Nobu] I didn't
buy it for you!

00:05:51.021 --> 00:05:51.488
(Hachi growling)

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:52.725
- Isn't that great, Satsuki?

00:05:52.825 --> 00:05:54.194
Say thanks to the nice old man.

00:05:54.294 --> 00:05:55.229
- Old man?

00:05:55.329 --> 00:05:56.231
(Shin laughing)

00:05:56.331 --> 00:05:58.435
- Thank you very much, Nobu.

00:05:58.537 --> 00:06:02.277
(Nobu gasping, then laughing
softly)

00:06:02.377 --> 00:06:03.914
- [Hachi Voiceover] The
slow movement of time

00:06:04.014 --> 00:06:09.090
purges the past and heals the
wounds in people's hearts.

00:06:09.191 --> 00:06:12.430
But there are some wounds
that can't heal.

00:06:14.401 --> 00:06:18.008
This apartment is just
like it was back then.

00:06:18.108 --> 00:06:20.681
Here, time stands still.

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:23.352
(tap squeaking)

00:06:23.452 --> 00:06:27.595
(water splashing and dripping)

00:06:27.695 --> 00:06:30.166
(underwater sloshing)

00:06:30.266 --> 00:06:30.834
- [Hachi Voiceover] Wait, Nana!

00:06:30.934 --> 00:06:33.038
I have to tell you
about me and Nobu!

00:06:33.138 --> 00:06:33.907
(water splashing)

00:06:34.007 --> 00:06:36.411
- [Nana] So what's
up with Nobuo?

00:06:43.593 --> 00:06:44.829
- [Nobu] Nana?

00:06:46.532 --> 00:06:48.435
What are you doing?

00:06:49.839 --> 00:06:50.507
- Bath salts.

00:06:50.607 --> 00:06:52.912
Can you smell the citrus?

00:06:53.012 --> 00:06:54.882
(Nobu humming sadly)

00:06:54.982 --> 00:06:56.886
You don't need to worry about
me.

00:06:56.986 --> 00:06:58.122
I'm fine now.

00:06:58.222 --> 00:07:01.796
(gentle chiming music)

00:07:04.267 --> 00:07:05.570
It's hot.

00:07:10.681 --> 00:07:13.419
I put out a towel for you too,
little man.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.222
(Nobu gasping)

00:07:15.323 --> 00:07:19.497
(sad music box theme playing)

00:07:24.474 --> 00:07:25.844
- [Hachi Voiceover] Hey, Nana-

00:07:25.944 --> 00:07:29.819
There are so many things I
want to talk to you about now.

00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:33.693
In this apartment, all
I can see are memories.

00:07:44.414 --> 00:07:49.024
(fireworks banging
and whistling)

00:07:55.971 --> 00:07:56.405
- Look at that!

00:07:56.506 --> 00:07:57.841
Isn't it awesome?
- You got the best view.

00:07:57.941 --> 00:07:59.411
- If we could watch the
fireworks from here,

00:07:59.512 --> 00:08:01.348
then we don't really need
disguises.

00:08:01.448 --> 00:08:03.085
- Uh-huh.

00:08:03.185 --> 00:08:04.220
Wait a minute, where's Hachiko?

00:08:04.321 --> 00:08:05.323
She should be here by now.

00:08:05.423 --> 00:08:08.429
- Maybe Takumi found out and
wouldn't let her come see us.

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:11.301
- I doubt it. That guy wouldn't
get hung up about something

00:08:11.401 --> 00:08:12.671
like a night of fireworks.

00:08:12.771 --> 00:08:14.608
- [Yasu] She's gotta
show up at some point.

00:08:14.709 --> 00:08:16.445
After all, no news is good news.

00:08:16.546 --> 00:08:19.050
- No way, it means
something's gone wrong.

00:08:20.019 --> 00:08:22.858
(Hachi sobbing)

00:08:44.568 --> 00:08:45.537
- [Hachi] I'd better hurry up.

00:08:45.637 --> 00:08:46.773
Everyone's waiting for me.

00:08:46.873 --> 00:08:50.714
If I let them down this
time and not show up,

00:08:50.814 --> 00:08:53.553
they'll think of me as a
traitor for sure.

00:08:57.093 --> 00:09:00.867
But for some reason
I can't stop crying.

00:09:00.967 --> 00:09:02.003
- Goodbye, Nana.

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.276
- [Hachi] I thought I'd
feel better

00:09:05.376 --> 00:09:07.380
once we talked things
over,

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:10.219
that it'd bring some
sort of closure.

00:09:10.319 --> 00:09:13.425
But now I realize that I
felt the most comfortable

00:09:13.526 --> 00:09:15.964
when I was with Shoji.

00:09:16.064 --> 00:09:18.903
We were good friends
before we went out.

00:09:19.003 --> 00:09:21.909
I thought that once the
breakup drama died down,

00:09:22.009 --> 00:09:24.949
things could go back to
the way they used to be.

00:09:25.584 --> 00:09:28.055
(Hachi sobbing)

00:09:28.155 --> 00:09:31.963
But now I've really
lost him forever.

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:36.672
I shouldn't have taken
him for granted.

00:09:38.576 --> 00:09:42.684
(cellphone jingle playing)

00:09:50.299 --> 00:09:51.268
What should I do?

00:09:51.368 --> 00:09:52.203
If I see Nobu now,

00:09:52.303 --> 00:09:55.476
there's no way I can talk
to him and act normal.

00:09:55.577 --> 00:09:59.350
I'll get sad and start crying
like crazy all over again.

00:09:59.451 --> 00:10:03.492
- I guess we've all gotta live
with the choices we've made.

00:10:03.593 --> 00:10:04.962
- What should I do?

00:10:06.799 --> 00:10:07.768
I can't just ditch them

00:10:07.868 --> 00:10:11.441
without giving them some
sort of explanation.

00:10:11.542 --> 00:10:11.976
(cellphone jingle continues)

00:10:12.076 --> 00:10:15.349
If I'm not gonna go, I've
gotta tell them something.

00:10:17.654 --> 00:10:19.525
(cellphone button beeping)

00:10:19.625 --> 00:10:22.531
- [Nana] Hello? Hachiko?

00:10:22.631 --> 00:10:25.102
(fireworks crackling)

00:10:25.202 --> 00:10:26.204
- [Hachi] Nana?

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:29.010
- [Nana] Where are you?

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:31.516
- I'm just outside of Jackson's.

00:10:31.616 --> 00:10:33.118
- [Nana] Oh, okay, well, hurry
up!

00:10:33.218 --> 00:10:35.322
The fireworks have
already started.

00:10:35.422 --> 00:10:38.596
(Hachi stifling her cries)

00:10:38.696 --> 00:10:39.732
- [Hachi] I'm so sorry.

00:10:39.832 --> 00:10:42.470
I don't think I can make it.

00:10:42.571 --> 00:10:44.274
(tense music)

00:10:44.374 --> 00:10:45.409
- Why not?

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:47.581
(Hachi sobbing)

00:10:47.681 --> 00:10:50.286
Hey, why are you crying?

00:10:51.454 --> 00:10:52.691
What happened?

00:10:54.795 --> 00:10:59.505
- [Hachi] It's 'cos I'm scared.

00:10:59.605 --> 00:11:01.241
Scared of seeing Nobu.

00:11:02.043 --> 00:11:03.680
(Hachi's sobbing intensifies)

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:06.819
(tragic music)

00:11:16.506 --> 00:11:18.075
- You don't need to worry,

00:11:18.175 --> 00:11:20.412
because Nobu isn't even
gonna show up.

00:11:20.514 --> 00:11:23.920
(fireworks banging)

00:11:30.132 --> 00:11:33.907
I tell you that boy hasn't got
any balls, that's for sure.

00:11:34.007 --> 00:11:35.944
He backed out at the last
minute.

00:11:36.044 --> 00:11:39.050
I can't believe what a chicken
he is.

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:41.522
So you've got nothing
to worry about.

00:11:41.622 --> 00:11:43.593
Just hurry up and get over here.

00:11:43.693 --> 00:11:46.566
Shin and Yasu are
dying to see you.

00:11:46.666 --> 00:11:50.172
Don't bail on us now at
the last minute.

00:11:50.272 --> 00:11:53.212
And you know, I really
wanna see you, Hachiko.

00:11:54.147 --> 00:11:55.550
So please hurry.

00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:58.355
(Hachi gasping)

00:11:58.455 --> 00:11:59.424
- Okay-

00:12:03.298 --> 00:12:04.267
(cellphone beeping)

00:12:04.367 --> 00:12:07.708
(heavy footsteps)

00:12:09.177 --> 00:12:11.649
- Where do you think
you're going, Nobuo?

00:12:11.749 --> 00:12:13.820
- I'm going home.

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:16.358
She doesn't wanna see me
so I can't stay.

00:12:16.458 --> 00:12:18.763
- [Nana] Hold on a second,
she didn't say that!

00:12:18.863 --> 00:12:20.734
She said she's scared
of seeing you!

00:12:20.834 --> 00:12:22.470
Don't you get it, she's
still in love with you!

00:12:22.571 --> 00:12:25.409
- Stop twisting things around
to how you want them to be.

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:26.077
- Listen to me.

00:12:26.177 --> 00:12:27.246
I know what she's going through.

00:12:27.346 --> 00:12:28.950
I know what it's like to
be so scared

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:30.052
of being swept away again

00:12:30.152 --> 00:12:32.791
that you just can't face that
person!

00:12:34.561 --> 00:12:37.366
She's gonna be getting married
to Takumi in only two weeks.

00:12:37.466 --> 00:12:38.368
It's right in front of her.

00:12:38.468 --> 00:12:40.072
But if she got back
together with you,

00:12:40.172 --> 00:12:42.978
then she would be stuck in
an impossible situation.

00:12:43.078 --> 00:12:45.684
So of course she's scared.

00:12:45.784 --> 00:12:48.055
(Nobu humming nervously)

00:12:48.155 --> 00:12:50.359
- All the more reason why
I shouldn't stay here.

00:12:50.459 --> 00:12:53.298
- God, why can't you
just get stuck with her?

00:13:03.553 --> 00:13:05.255
All right, fine.

00:13:05.356 --> 00:13:07.326
I get it, you just wanted to
comfort her.

00:13:07.426 --> 00:13:09.163
First, when she got
dumped by Shoji.

00:13:09.263 --> 00:13:12.804
And then when she was
getting played by Takumi.

00:13:12.904 --> 00:13:14.541
You never really did love her.

00:13:14.642 --> 00:13:15.109
- [Nobu] I do love her!

00:13:15.209 --> 00:13:16.211
What the hell do you know?

00:13:16.311 --> 00:13:18.215
- [Nana] Right. Like you
love that girl in the room

00:13:18.315 --> 00:13:19.350
next to you?

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:21.756
You know, she's got the
same condition as me.

00:13:21.856 --> 00:13:22.591
Ginpei told me.

00:13:22.691 --> 00:13:25.664
She can't even work if she
doesn't take her medication.

00:13:25.764 --> 00:13:27.033
- What the hell does that
matter?

00:13:27.133 --> 00:13:31.241
She's a good person and she's
trying, despite all that.

00:13:31.341 --> 00:13:33.613
- Ever since I met you in high
school,

00:13:33.713 --> 00:13:36.384
you always liked to go for
the girls who had problems.

00:13:36.484 --> 00:13:39.692
Girls you thought needed to
be rescued from something.

00:13:39.792 --> 00:13:40.927
That way you could step up

00:13:41.027 --> 00:13:44.067
and play the part of
the hero, right?

00:13:44.167 --> 00:13:44.968
- Come on, Nana. Cut it out.

00:13:45.069 --> 00:13:47.306
- But whenever things
start to get serious,

00:13:47.406 --> 00:13:48.509
you can't handle it.

00:13:48.609 --> 00:13:49.878
All you do is give up on them.

00:13:49.978 --> 00:13:52.483
- Nobu, you know she's
just provoking you.

00:13:52.584 --> 00:13:54.420
Don't take any of it seriously.

00:13:56.191 --> 00:13:58.696
(Nobu breathing intensely)

00:13:58.796 --> 00:14:00.834
- Hmm.

00:14:00.934 --> 00:14:03.706
I'd call that the easy way out.

00:14:03.806 --> 00:14:06.144
(tense electronic music)

00:14:06.244 --> 00:14:11.187
(fireworks whistling and
crackling)

00:14:17.233 --> 00:14:20.573
- Nana can be really cruel
when she wants to be.

00:14:21.542 --> 00:14:22.744
She's manipulating them,

00:14:22.844 --> 00:14:25.750
putting them in an
impossible situation.

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:26.952
The way she confronted Nobu,

00:14:27.053 --> 00:14:29.625
of course he's gonna
react to it and get angry.

00:14:29.725 --> 00:14:30.827
And Hachi will end up getting
hurt

00:14:30.927 --> 00:14:33.331
even more than she
already has been.

00:14:35.169 --> 00:14:37.874
The thing is, Nobu's a pacifist.

00:14:37.974 --> 00:14:40.145
He doesn't want
anyone to suffer.

00:14:40.245 --> 00:14:42.216
He'll sacrifice his own
happiness to make sure

00:14:42.316 --> 00:14:44.320
that everyone else is happy.

00:14:45.757 --> 00:14:47.126
Avoiding conflict doesn't mean

00:14:47.226 --> 00:14:48.796
you're taking the easy way out.

00:14:48.896 --> 00:14:50.867
At least, that's what I think.

00:14:53.706 --> 00:14:56.010
- Yeah. I agree.

00:14:56.111 --> 00:14:59.283
He's locked in a battle
against everything he desires.

00:15:06.732 --> 00:15:07.667
- [Vendor] How many?

00:15:07.768 --> 00:15:08.201
- Hm?

00:15:08.301 --> 00:15:10.272
- [Vendor] Hey, miss, how many
you want?

00:15:11.876 --> 00:15:13.145
- Just three.

00:15:23.599 --> 00:15:26.939
- [Nobu] I'll do whatever
it takes to make you happy.

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:33.953
(doorbell ringing)

00:15:49.952 --> 00:15:50.720
- [Nana Voiceover] And you know,

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:52.657
I really wanna see you, Hachiko.

00:15:56.532 --> 00:15:57.601
So please hurry.

00:16:03.613 --> 00:16:06.552
(soaring guitar music)

00:16:06.652 --> 00:16:07.621
But if she got back together
with you,

00:16:07.721 --> 00:16:11.161
then she would be stuck in
an impossible situation.

00:16:24.822 --> 00:16:27.159
(fireworks banging)

00:16:27.259 --> 00:16:30.667
- It's been so long since
I've seen these fireworks.

00:16:30.767 --> 00:16:32.036
They really are pretty.

00:16:32.136 --> 00:16:33.739
- This is the first
time I've ever had food

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:34.541
from a street vendor.

00:16:34.641 --> 00:16:35.877
- Huh?
- Huh?

00:16:35.977 --> 00:16:37.781
- You know, it tastes really
good.

00:16:37.881 --> 00:16:41.020
But it's hard to eat with
these stupid chopsticks.

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:41.922
(Yasu groaning)

00:16:42.022 --> 00:16:43.593
- I wonder if any of
these stands have forks-

00:16:43.693 --> 00:16:44.360
- Wait, don't spoil him!

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:45.229
He just needs to practice.

00:16:45.329 --> 00:16:46.464
- [Yasu] Hey!
(cellphone jingle ringing)

00:16:46.565 --> 00:16:47.534
Don't grab me like that!

00:16:47.634 --> 00:16:48.970
My wig almost fell off.

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:49.738
(Nana laughing)

00:16:49.838 --> 00:16:50.640
- [Nana] Your wig!

00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:51.809
(Nana laughing hysterically)

00:16:51.909 --> 00:16:52.911
- Yeah, hello?

00:16:53.011 --> 00:16:54.213
- Hi, Shin?

00:16:54.313 --> 00:16:56.150
- [Shin] Hey, what's up?

00:16:56.251 --> 00:16:57.386
- I'm outside the apartment,

00:16:57.486 --> 00:16:59.390
but no one's answering the door.

00:16:59.490 --> 00:16:59.758
(Shin gasping)

00:16:59.858 --> 00:17:02.162
Did you guys already leave
to go see the fireworks?

00:17:02.263 --> 00:17:05.035
(firework banging)

00:17:05.135 --> 00:17:07.741
Because the lights are
still on the apartment.

00:17:07.841 --> 00:17:09.076
Where are you?

00:17:10.045 --> 00:17:11.347
Shin?

00:17:11.447 --> 00:17:12.551
- Hm.

00:17:12.651 --> 00:17:16.457
Yeah, we couldn't wait any
longer so we decided to leave.

00:17:16.559 --> 00:17:17.928
I'm sorry.

00:17:18.028 --> 00:17:18.596
(Hachi laughing softly)

00:17:18.696 --> 00:17:20.900
- No, I'm sorry, I'm
the one who's late.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.169
I'll head down there right now.

00:17:22.269 --> 00:17:24.173
Where exactly are you
watching them from?

00:17:24.273 --> 00:17:25.977
(Hachi's footsteps echoing)

00:17:26.077 --> 00:17:27.446
Yeah, I think I know
where that is.

00:17:27.547 --> 00:17:29.751
I'll call you if I
can't find you.

00:17:30.787 --> 00:17:32.958
what? You're in drag?

00:17:33.058 --> 00:17:36.197
(Hachi giggling)

00:17:43.913 --> 00:17:47.319
(fireworks banging)

00:17:53.231 --> 00:17:53.933
- [Nana Voiceover] God,

00:17:54.033 --> 00:17:56.104
why can't you just get
stuck with her?

00:17:58.509 --> 00:18:01.447
(Nobu sniffling)

00:18:05.255 --> 00:18:07.694
I'd call that the easy way out.

00:18:08.896 --> 00:18:09.932
- Hey, over here!

00:18:10.032 --> 00:18:11.769
- [Hachi] Oh my God! Shin?

00:18:11.869 --> 00:18:12.403
You're so cute!

00:18:12.504 --> 00:18:14.273
- [Shin] Come on, we're
all sitting down here.

00:18:14.373 --> 00:18:18.281
(fireworks exploding)

00:18:18.381 --> 00:18:20.485
- They're beautiful!

00:18:20.586 --> 00:18:21.354
Amazing!

00:18:21.454 --> 00:18:23.491
- (high-pitched) They really
are pretty, aren't they?

00:18:23.593 --> 00:18:24.160
- Stop it, Shin!

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:26.130
You sound like Misato
when you talk like that.

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:27.634
(Shin and Hachi giggling)

00:18:27.734 --> 00:18:30.005
- That's a big rock
you got on your finger.

00:18:30.105 --> 00:18:30.573
(Nana humming nervously)

00:18:30.673 --> 00:18:34.213
Speaking of which, I get why
you didn't wanna invite Nobu,

00:18:34.313 --> 00:18:36.719
but why didn't you send
me an invitation?

00:18:36.819 --> 00:18:39.090
You did invite Yasu and Shin.

00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:39.925
- You mean you'd really come?

00:18:40.025 --> 00:18:41.929
- Well. Yeah, of course
I'd come.

00:18:42.029 --> 00:18:43.264
I could even sing you a
punk version of

00:18:43.365 --> 00:18:45.068
"Tentoumushi Samba" if
you wanted.

00:18:45.168 --> 00:18:46.672
- what's that? What kind
of song is it?

00:18:46.772 --> 00:18:49.110
- I'll get you the CD
so we can arrange it.

00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:50.345
You'll play the guitar part.

00:18:50.445 --> 00:18:52.449
- You'd better be happy
no matter what, okay?

00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:53.586
- Mm?

00:18:54.888 --> 00:18:56.190
(somber guitar music)

00:18:56.291 --> 00:18:58.028
- I think you know that
Nobu stepped aside

00:18:58.128 --> 00:18:59.263
so that you could be happy.

00:18:59.363 --> 00:19:01.835
So if you end up sad
or depressed,

00:19:01.935 --> 00:19:03.639
then it was all for nothing.

00:19:06.512 --> 00:19:09.685
Well, I'm sure that Takumi
is gonna make you cry

00:19:09.785 --> 00:19:10.520
from time to time,

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:12.089
but you're the fool who
fell in love with him.

00:19:12.189 --> 00:19:15.997
So I'm afraid you're just
gonna have to deal with it.

00:19:16.097 --> 00:19:18.936
And don't get upset when he
cheats on you now and then,

00:19:19.036 --> 00:19:20.172
all right?

00:19:20.272 --> 00:19:23.178
Just smack him around
until you feel better.

00:19:29.758 --> 00:19:31.327
- Yeah, you're right.

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:33.632
Thank you, Nana.

00:19:39.043 --> 00:19:39.410
- [Hachi Voiceover] That night,

00:19:39.511 --> 00:19:42.049
the riverbank was
packed with people,

00:19:42.149 --> 00:19:46.024
and I never did bump into
Shoji or his girlfriend.

00:19:46.124 --> 00:19:47.092
It felt like a curtain

00:19:47.192 --> 00:19:49.931
had finally fallen on
our relationship.

00:19:52.604 --> 00:19:55.342
There was such a big crowd that
you could easily lose sight

00:19:55.442 --> 00:19:57.881
of the people you were with.

00:19:57.981 --> 00:20:00.620
So I wanted to hold Nana's hand,

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:02.456
but I was worried she'd be
annoyed

00:20:02.557 --> 00:20:06.097
if I innocently grabbed
her hand, which was as warm

00:20:06.197 --> 00:20:07.767
as Nobu's.

00:20:07.867 --> 00:20:11.441
The wind on my fingertips
was freezing cold.

00:20:11.542 --> 00:20:14.280
Actually, come to think of it,

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:16.618
summer ended long
ago, didn't it?

00:20:19.558 --> 00:20:20.626
(car engine humming)

00:20:20.727 --> 00:20:22.831
- Did you guys have fun at the
fireworks?

00:20:22.931 --> 00:20:26.037
I hope you're all rested and
ready to get back to work.

00:20:26.137 --> 00:20:29.911
(Ginpei gasping, confused)

00:20:30.011 --> 00:20:31.147
(Ginpei groaning)

00:20:31.247 --> 00:20:35.590
(somber guitar music continues)

00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:40.867
- [Hachi Voiceover] Hey Nana,

00:20:40.967 --> 00:20:44.340
that summer you longed
for more than anyone?

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:46.945
The one we couldn't get back?

00:20:47.045 --> 00:20:49.718
Well, it's here now.

00:20:50.452 --> 00:20:52.657
I'll always be waiting.

00:20:52.757 --> 00:20:54.628
For 10 years,

00:20:54.728 --> 00:20:55.897
20 years,

00:20:56.965 --> 00:20:58.268
50 years.

00:22:21.802 --> 00:22:23.506
Hey, Nana?
