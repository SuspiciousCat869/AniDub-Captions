WEBVTT

00:00:04.182 --> 00:00:05.986
- [Nana] Hey, Nana,
remember when we

00:00:06.086 --> 00:00:08.390
would see each other
all the time?

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.330
Even then, I could never
understand you.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.100
You can't blame me though.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.173
No one in the world can
understand you,

00:00:16.273 --> 00:00:18.778
so cut me some slack, okay?

00:00:18.878 --> 00:00:21.618
(rock music)

00:01:56.808 --> 00:02:00.247
- Hi, y'all, welcome
back to Junko's Place.

00:02:00.347 --> 00:02:00.882
- It's been a while.

00:02:00.982 --> 00:02:04.422
I wonder who's gonna walk
through that door today?

00:02:04.523 --> 00:02:05.726
- Well, come on in.

00:02:05.826 --> 00:02:06.794
- Oh, wow, I've wanted

00:02:06.894 --> 00:02:10.267
to see this since forever,
Junko's Place.

00:02:12.071 --> 00:02:13.407
- And who is this guy exactly?

00:02:13.508 --> 00:02:14.977
- Naoki from Trapnest, right?

00:02:15.077 --> 00:02:15.946
Good to meet you.

00:02:16.046 --> 00:02:17.950
- Oh, of course, welcome.

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.285
But wait, isn't he a lead?

00:02:19.386 --> 00:02:20.154
What is he doing here?

00:02:20.254 --> 00:02:23.293
- I'd hate to say it, but
this can only mean one thing.

00:02:23.394 --> 00:02:25.398
- [Junko And Kyosuke]
His character is doomed.

00:02:25.498 --> 00:02:28.237
(Naoki shouts)
- Papparyakko.

00:02:28.337 --> 00:02:29.874
- Oh, you don't need to
worry about that guy.

00:02:29.974 --> 00:02:32.111
- He's a resident statue in
Junko's Place,

00:02:32.211 --> 00:02:34.249
our patron saint of
lovesick men.

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.319
- Stop talking about
me like that.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.923
I'm not a piece of decor.

00:02:38.023 --> 00:02:39.693
I have feelings too, you know.

00:02:39.794 --> 00:02:41.898
Lately, you guys have been real
jerks.

00:02:41.998 --> 00:02:42.566
Last time I was here--

00:02:42.666 --> 00:02:44.235
- Hey, do you guys think
Hachiko's gonna

00:02:44.335 --> 00:02:45.137
be dropping by today?

00:02:45.237 --> 00:02:47.509
- By Hachiko, do you mean Nana
Komatsu?

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:50.916
- Yeah, from what I hear,
she's a super awesome chick.

00:02:51.016 --> 00:02:52.151
She plays the game like a pro.

00:02:52.251 --> 00:02:54.255
Great in the kitchen,
great in the sack.

00:02:54.355 --> 00:02:54.757
And on top of all that,

00:02:54.857 --> 00:02:57.428
she's completely faithful
to Takumi of all people.

00:02:57.529 --> 00:02:59.299
- Are we talking about the
same girl?

00:02:59.399 --> 00:03:00.902
- Yeah, I'm not too sure
about all that.

00:03:01.002 --> 00:03:01.671
- Huh?

00:03:01.771 --> 00:03:04.309
- Hey, how about we watch a few
clips.

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:07.549
(doorbell rings)

00:03:08.183 --> 00:03:09.419
- Huh?

00:03:11.991 --> 00:03:14.095
Hey, Hachiko.
(Nana gasps)

00:03:14.195 --> 00:03:17.769
(tense dramatic music)

00:03:18.805 --> 00:03:21.644
(Hachiko sobs)

00:03:27.355 --> 00:03:28.958
- [Shin] Takumi pisses me off.

00:03:29.058 --> 00:03:30.394
Hachi's our pet.

00:03:30.494 --> 00:03:31.631
- [Nobu] She isn't a dog, you
know?

00:03:31.731 --> 00:03:34.002
- But it's not fair what
he's done to you.

00:03:34.102 --> 00:03:35.639
You need to get her back, Nobu.

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:37.943
You do like Hachi, don't you?

00:03:38.043 --> 00:03:40.649
But knowing Hachi, even
if this was something

00:03:40.749 --> 00:03:42.118
that happened in the heat of the
moment,

00:03:42.218 --> 00:03:45.391
I'll bet she'll get more
and more attached to him.

00:03:45.491 --> 00:03:47.863
If Takumi treats her
like all his other women,

00:03:47.963 --> 00:03:49.767
it's obvious Hachi's
gonna get hurt.

00:03:49.867 --> 00:03:52.506
Doesn't it bother you to think
that might happen to her?

00:03:52.606 --> 00:03:54.577
It bothers the hell out of me.

00:03:59.587 --> 00:04:01.757
If you want her, then go for it.

00:04:30.414 --> 00:04:31.517
- I shouldn't have
barged in on you.

00:04:31.617 --> 00:04:33.922
And I said all
those weird things.

00:04:38.463 --> 00:04:40.467
Anyway, now that
I have the chance,

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:42.739
I'm gonna come
straight to the point.

00:04:55.164 --> 00:04:57.836
I'm in love with you.

00:04:57.936 --> 00:05:00.709
It's probably not fair of
me to tell you all this,

00:05:00.809 --> 00:05:03.447
because I know it's not
gonna make any difference.

00:05:03.548 --> 00:05:06.353
You see, I know about you and
Takumi.

00:05:08.858 --> 00:05:13.601
I'm sorry; you avoided
the studio today.

00:05:13.701 --> 00:05:15.237
It was because of me, right?

00:05:15.337 --> 00:05:15.972
- No, that's not it.

00:05:16.072 --> 00:05:17.743
I didn't come 'cause I had to
work today.

00:05:17.843 --> 00:05:19.412
- Well, I just wanted
you to know you don't

00:05:19.513 --> 00:05:20.047
have to worry about me.

00:05:20.147 --> 00:05:21.951
You should keep coming to
rehearsals.

00:05:22.051 --> 00:05:24.489
Everyone really misses
you when you aren't there.

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:25.558
Actually, I'm the one

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:30.100
who misses you.
- Thanks, Nobu.

00:05:32.506 --> 00:05:34.677
- [Nobu] Well, that's a relief.

00:05:42.859 --> 00:05:45.966
You know, this is more than
enough for me.

00:05:52.478 --> 00:05:55.518
(gentle music)

00:06:15.925 --> 00:06:18.598
- Nobu, you don't have
to walk me all the way.

00:06:18.698 --> 00:06:20.167
I'll be all right on my own from
here.

00:06:20.267 --> 00:06:21.570
The apartment's just over there.

00:06:21.671 --> 00:06:22.839
I'm sorry for making you
walk me home

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:25.411
when it's so out of
your way.

00:06:25.512 --> 00:06:27.448
- It's not that far,
and I really don't mind.

00:06:27.549 --> 00:06:29.052
- [Takumi] Nana.
- Huh?

00:06:33.761 --> 00:06:36.567
- Well, well, fancy
seeing you here.

00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:40.709
Thanks, Nobu.
- Yes, thank you, Nobu.

00:06:43.514 --> 00:06:44.883
Have a good night.

00:06:47.121 --> 00:06:49.526
- [Nobu] I can't take
it anymore.

00:06:52.231 --> 00:06:53.100
- Tell me what happened.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.605
- Nothing, leave me alone.

00:06:56.907 --> 00:07:00.582
Sorry, I just need some
time on my own, okay?

00:07:01.182 --> 00:07:04.022
(gentle music)

00:07:05.692 --> 00:07:10.167
Shin, if a man and a
woman are just objects

00:07:10.267 --> 00:07:13.006
of desire to each other,

00:07:13.106 --> 00:07:17.616
then do you think they could
ever be connected by love?

00:07:17.716 --> 00:07:21.122
- Sorry, I'm not sure of that
myself.

00:07:24.797 --> 00:07:26.734
- Yeah.
- Takumi?

00:07:28.336 --> 00:07:29.606
I wanna see you.

00:07:29.707 --> 00:07:33.581
(gentle music)
Nana ...

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:13.360
Thank you.
- Huh, what for?

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:16.767
- Actually, I kind of thought
you might not ever want

00:08:16.867 --> 00:08:21.610
to talk to me again, so
I'm glad you came tonight.

00:08:22.879 --> 00:08:24.850
- What are you talking about?

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:27.556
I mean, of course I'll talk to
you.

00:08:27.656 --> 00:08:28.558
- [Hachiko] I'm sorry.

00:08:28.658 --> 00:08:29.827
- What are you apologizing for?

00:08:29.927 --> 00:08:31.429
You didn't do anything wrong.

00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:37.274
- I did, and the truth is,
I really am a horrible girl.

00:08:39.345 --> 00:08:41.149
(Nobu laughs)

00:08:41.249 --> 00:08:42.886
- [Nobu] What do you mean,
horrible?

00:08:42.986 --> 00:08:44.623
Horrible how?
- I'm serious.

00:08:44.723 --> 00:08:46.159
Nobu, stop always idealizing me.

00:08:46.259 --> 00:08:49.566
If you saw who I really was,
you wouldn't even like me.

00:08:49.666 --> 00:08:53.941
If you knew the real me,
you'd be disappointed.

00:09:00.789 --> 00:09:03.694
(Hachiko sobs)

00:09:03.795 --> 00:09:07.602
- All right, then,
disappoint me; I'm ready.

00:09:08.738 --> 00:09:10.642
Otherwise, I don't know how else
I'm gonna

00:09:10.742 --> 00:09:12.879
be able to stop loving you.

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:20.829
(dramatic instrumental music)

00:09:48.416 --> 00:09:51.155
(rock music)

00:10:18.511 --> 00:10:23.220
- I'm sorry, I promise I'll
break it off with Takumi.

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:26.961
It's just that, I, I
really didn't want anyone

00:10:27.061 --> 00:10:29.165
to know about me and Takumi.

00:10:29.265 --> 00:10:32.238
I was pretending that
it didn't really happen,

00:10:32.338 --> 00:10:35.778
and then I could be your
girlfriend.

00:10:35.879 --> 00:10:40.187
I guess in the end, I just
screwed up everything.

00:10:40.287 --> 00:10:42.224
Do you hate me now?

00:10:42.324 --> 00:10:45.330
- No, I never could.

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:48.871
The thing is, I can't
take you away from him

00:10:48.971 --> 00:10:51.075
and I don't own you,
and I don't want

00:10:51.175 --> 00:10:53.313
to make you sneak
around either,

00:10:55.083 --> 00:10:58.156
but I don't think you
screwed things up.

00:10:58.256 --> 00:11:01.429
You really shouldn't
be so hard on yourself.

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:05.103
I'm sure you can't help it that
you're attracted to Takumi,

00:11:05.939 --> 00:11:07.575
and no matter how hard I try,

00:11:07.676 --> 00:11:09.145
I just can't compete with him.

00:11:09.245 --> 00:11:10.347
- That's not true, really, I--

00:11:10.447 --> 00:11:13.854
- But even so, if you tell
me that you'll break up

00:11:13.955 --> 00:11:16.192
with him and go out with me,

00:11:17.361 --> 00:11:20.267
I'll do whatever it
takes to make you happy.

00:11:22.739 --> 00:11:24.008
For the sake of your happiness,

00:11:24.108 --> 00:11:27.649
I will do everything
within my power, I promise.

00:11:27.749 --> 00:11:32.892
I mean, I feel like I can do
anything with you by my side.

00:11:33.928 --> 00:11:35.531
So once you've broken
up with Takumi

00:11:35.632 --> 00:11:40.440
and sorted out your
feelings, then come to me.

00:11:40.541 --> 00:11:42.746
I'll be waiting for you.

00:11:57.709 --> 00:11:58.644
- Sorry, I gotta go right now,

00:11:58.744 --> 00:12:00.848
but I'll call you back when
I have more time to talk.

00:12:00.948 --> 00:12:01.817
- Why bother?

00:12:01.917 --> 00:12:05.457
In fact, don't ever call
me again, so goodbye.

00:12:10.133 --> 00:12:10.902
- How was work today?

00:12:11.002 --> 00:12:11.637
(Nobu shouts)

00:12:11.737 --> 00:12:13.641
- Don't sneak up on me
like that.

00:12:13.741 --> 00:12:14.308
I told you to come to me

00:12:14.408 --> 00:12:16.547
after you'd worked things
out with Takumi.

00:12:16.647 --> 00:12:17.749
- But I did, that's why--

00:12:17.849 --> 00:12:19.653
- It's too fast.

00:12:19.753 --> 00:12:21.489
- Nana?

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:24.028
You know, me and Nobu ...

00:12:28.403 --> 00:12:32.277
I think I'm, I'm head over
heels in love with Nobu.

00:12:39.926 --> 00:12:41.362
- [Nana] Of course you are.

00:12:41.462 --> 00:12:43.868
- Wait a second,
let me get this straight.

00:12:43.968 --> 00:12:44.903
There's Nobu and Takumi,

00:12:45.003 --> 00:12:47.107
and Ren and his old
girlfriend Nana Osaki,

00:12:47.207 --> 00:12:49.245
and she happens to be
roommates with Hachiko?

00:12:49.345 --> 00:12:51.482
- I know, the relationships
in this story

00:12:51.583 --> 00:12:52.552
are getting confusing.

00:12:52.652 --> 00:12:53.554
- Check this out.

00:12:53.654 --> 00:12:54.388
This little chart I put together

00:12:54.488 --> 00:12:56.225
of all the character
connections in this anime

00:12:56.325 --> 00:12:59.265
should clarify everything.
- [Naoki] Wow.

00:13:00.367 --> 00:13:02.071
- [Kyosuke] This doesn't clarify
anything.

00:13:02.171 --> 00:13:05.210
- [Junko] Look, Naoki's
not connected to anyone.

00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:06.279
- What?

00:13:08.884 --> 00:13:09.753
Are you kidding me?

00:13:09.853 --> 00:13:11.022
I'm like best friends with Yasu.

00:13:11.122 --> 00:13:14.261
In fact, I'm having drinks
with him right after ...

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:16.900
(Naoki shouts)

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:17.869
- Are you really friends with
him?

00:13:17.969 --> 00:13:19.305
- Yeah, we go way back.

00:13:19.405 --> 00:13:22.144
- Well, the record says
otherwise, watch.

00:13:22.244 --> 00:13:22.712
- How's it going?

00:13:22.812 --> 00:13:25.083
Isn't it great that we're
finally able to hang out?

00:13:25.183 --> 00:13:27.321
- I only came so you'd
stop bugging me.

00:13:27.421 --> 00:13:29.659
- And if that isn't
enough to convince you,

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:30.360
then there's this.

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:32.331
- Go home, the band
will be better off

00:13:32.431 --> 00:13:35.538
without you dragging us down,
dude.

00:13:35.638 --> 00:13:36.272
- What the hell?

00:13:36.372 --> 00:13:39.211
How on earth did you guys find
out so much about my life?

00:13:39.311 --> 00:13:42.084
- Don't you know this is
what we do at Junko's Place?

00:13:42.184 --> 00:13:42.886
- Ain't that the truth?

00:13:42.986 --> 00:13:46.459
(Naoki sobs)

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:48.296
- I don't care what you guys
say.

00:13:48.396 --> 00:13:50.835
Me and Yasu are best friends.

00:13:50.935 --> 00:13:53.440
You'll see, I'll just draw a
line here.

00:13:53.541 --> 00:13:56.245
(paper rips)

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:02.458
- Now you're totally on your
own.

00:14:02.559 --> 00:14:05.330
(Naoki sobs)

00:14:13.948 --> 00:14:15.618
- [Doctor] Well, you are
pregnant.

00:14:15.718 --> 00:14:19.191
This small black circle
is the chorionic sac.

00:14:19.291 --> 00:14:21.462
That little dot you see inside?

00:14:21.563 --> 00:14:22.966
It's your baby.

00:14:27.575 --> 00:14:28.544
- [Takumi] Is it morning
sickness?

00:14:28.644 --> 00:14:31.149
- I'm gonna get an
abortion, so don't worry.

00:14:31.249 --> 00:14:34.488
Listen, you don't need
to feel responsible.

00:14:34.589 --> 00:14:35.992
I'm the foolish one.

00:14:36.092 --> 00:14:39.031
For all I know, it
could be my boyfriend's.

00:14:40.267 --> 00:14:45.443
Just go, and please,
don't come back.

00:14:45.545 --> 00:14:47.014
- Your boyfriend, Nobu?

00:14:47.114 --> 00:14:48.049
(Hachiko gasps)

00:14:48.149 --> 00:14:51.088
(tense music)

00:14:58.604 --> 00:14:59.706
- Takumi?

00:15:00.641 --> 00:15:02.077
What are you doing?

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:04.482
Takumi?

00:15:08.022 --> 00:15:10.293
Please don't tell Nobu.

00:15:13.266 --> 00:15:15.036
- [Nana] What is it?
- [Takumi] Hey,

00:15:15.136 --> 00:15:17.341
are you there?
- [Nobu] Yeah.

00:15:17.441 --> 00:15:19.880
- Turns out our Nana
is pregnant.

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:21.783
I don't know if it's yours
or mine,

00:15:21.884 --> 00:15:23.854
but no matter who the father
is,

00:15:23.954 --> 00:15:24.990
if Nana wants to keep it,

00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:27.194
I plan to recognize
the baby as mine

00:15:27.294 --> 00:15:29.265
and take care of both of them.

00:15:32.404 --> 00:15:34.141
What do you think about that?

00:15:34.241 --> 00:15:37.347
(dramatic music)

00:15:56.653 --> 00:15:57.855
- Nana?

00:15:57.956 --> 00:16:00.126
Is it true that you're pregnant?

00:16:00.227 --> 00:16:03.299
Hey, I just wanna hear it from
you.

00:16:03.399 --> 00:16:05.036
It could be my child.

00:16:05.136 --> 00:16:06.907
You don't have to hide from me,

00:16:07.007 --> 00:16:10.413
and I already knew that you'd
just broken up with Takumi.

00:16:10.514 --> 00:16:14.054
- I'm sorry.
(Nobu gasps)

00:16:16.927 --> 00:16:19.766
(Hachiko sobs)

00:16:21.202 --> 00:16:23.139
- I don't get it.

00:16:23.239 --> 00:16:26.112
Why are you apologizing?

00:16:26.212 --> 00:16:28.784
You did break up with him,
didn't you?

00:16:32.224 --> 00:16:35.263
(Hachiko sobs)

00:16:43.781 --> 00:16:45.918
Please, just make up an excuse.

00:16:46.018 --> 00:16:48.189
Do it for my sake.

00:16:48.289 --> 00:16:50.327
Even if it's a lie, I don't
care.

00:16:50.427 --> 00:16:52.097
I'll believe anything.

00:16:55.838 --> 00:16:57.074
- I'm so sorry.

00:16:57.174 --> 00:17:02.652
(Hachiko sobs)
(Nobu sobs)

00:17:08.496 --> 00:17:10.500
I think I wanna have this baby

00:17:10.601 --> 00:17:14.208
and raise it as your child,
if that's all right with you.

00:17:19.552 --> 00:17:21.422
- [Takumi] Wanna get married?

00:17:21.523 --> 00:17:22.725
- Huh?

00:17:22.825 --> 00:17:24.228
- If I marry an ordinary girl,

00:17:24.328 --> 00:17:26.633
the media might not go as crazy.

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.242
You don't wanna?

00:17:34.649 --> 00:17:37.487
(gentle music)

00:17:40.861 --> 00:17:42.297
- [Nana] Married?

00:17:42.397 --> 00:17:44.368
- So I am sorry it's
short notice,

00:17:44.468 --> 00:17:47.809
but that means you're gonna
need to find a new roommate.

00:17:49.445 --> 00:17:51.382
I imagine this is an
inconvenience for you,

00:17:51.482 --> 00:17:54.455
this happening all of a
sudden, so I will pay her half

00:17:54.556 --> 00:17:56.125
of the rent 'til you find
someone new.

00:17:56.225 --> 00:17:57.729
- I don't need it.

00:17:58.363 --> 00:18:01.335
(tense music)

00:18:01.937 --> 00:18:02.672
(Hachiko gasps)

00:18:02.772 --> 00:18:06.312
- I can't stand to think that
another guy was inside you.

00:18:08.584 --> 00:18:10.921
You don't need to worry about
anything,

00:18:11.022 --> 00:18:13.827
just focus on making me happy.

00:18:14.963 --> 00:18:17.735
(Nana groans)

00:18:19.906 --> 00:18:21.242
- [Hachiko] You're way more
important

00:18:21.342 --> 00:18:23.647
than any boyfriend, Nana.

00:18:23.747 --> 00:18:27.689
I think I'm, I'm head over
heels in love with Nobu.

00:18:27.789 --> 00:18:30.928
- [Takumi] You'll need to
look for a new roommate.

00:18:31.763 --> 00:18:33.634
(fist thuds)

00:18:33.734 --> 00:18:35.003
- [Hachiko] 'Cause if you don't
like them,

00:18:35.103 --> 00:18:35.671
I don't want them.

00:18:35.771 --> 00:18:36.973
There's no point in me buying
them

00:18:37.074 --> 00:18:38.811
unless we're both gonna
use 'em.

00:18:38.911 --> 00:18:40.848
- [Nana] Why don't
you use the strawberry glass?

00:18:40.948 --> 00:18:42.819
- [Hachiko] 'Cause we
only have two of them.

00:18:42.919 --> 00:18:44.321
What if one of them breaks?

00:18:44.421 --> 00:18:46.292
- [Nana] But what's the
point if you never use them?

00:18:46.392 --> 00:18:48.196
- [Hachiko] Yeah,
but they're a set.

00:18:48.296 --> 00:18:50.366
It'd be sad if one of
them breaks.

00:18:50.467 --> 00:18:53.974
You can use them, just
be careful, okay?

00:18:54.074 --> 00:18:55.544
(glass shatters)

00:18:55.644 --> 00:18:59.753
(somber instrumental music)

00:19:25.403 --> 00:19:26.640
(glass shatters)

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:27.474
- Nana?

00:19:27.575 --> 00:19:29.244
- Don't worry about her.

00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:45.410
(Hachiko sobs)

00:19:55.497 --> 00:19:58.436
(Nana gasps)

00:20:06.485 --> 00:20:07.722
- What's this?

00:20:15.136 --> 00:20:16.172
(Nana knocks)

00:20:16.272 --> 00:20:17.508
Hachi?

00:20:26.258 --> 00:20:28.429
Hachiko, are you in here?

00:20:31.402 --> 00:20:35.811
(somber instrumental rock music)

00:22:14.107 --> 00:22:15.209
- So there you go.

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:17.615
Hope you enjoyed the third
installment of Junko's Place

00:22:17.715 --> 00:22:19.384
as much as we did.

00:22:19.484 --> 00:22:21.422
Drop by anytime.

00:22:21.523 --> 00:22:22.324
See you later, everyone.

00:22:22.424 --> 00:22:24.261
- Seriously, I should be
getting more lines than this.

00:22:24.361 --> 00:22:26.065
Hey, hold on.
