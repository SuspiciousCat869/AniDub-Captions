00:00:02.054 --> 00:00:05.595
- [Nana K Voiceover] I know
I'm kind of digressing here,

00:00:05.695 --> 00:00:07.364
but bear with me.

00:00:07.464 --> 00:00:09.101
Ever since I was a child,

00:00:09.201 --> 00:00:11.039
I had this dream that one day,

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:14.111
I would become a beautiful
bride.

00:00:14.211 --> 00:00:17.752
It was the only thing I ever
wanted to be.

00:00:17.852 --> 00:00:21.259
(upbeat rock music)

00:01:47.398 --> 00:01:48.734
- Money for my wedding?

00:01:48.834 --> 00:01:49.703
- That's right, honey.

00:01:49.803 --> 00:01:51.807
A wedding's a once in a lifetime
event

00:01:51.907 --> 00:01:52.709
and it costs a lot.

00:01:52.809 --> 00:01:55.982
So bit by bit, I've been putting
some money aside for you.

00:01:56.082 --> 00:01:58.086
Having three daughters makes
things

00:01:58.186 --> 00:02:00.424
a little more difficult
as you might imagine.

00:02:00.525 --> 00:02:01.325
- But if this money's supposed

00:02:01.426 --> 00:02:03.396
to be for my wedding,
why give it to me now?

00:02:03.496 --> 00:02:06.002
- [Mother] Well, you
did elope, didn't you?

00:02:06.102 --> 00:02:06.837
(dramatic music)
- Huh?

00:02:06.937 --> 00:02:08.239
- Hi mom, I'm home!

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:10.745
- Nami, do you realize how late
it is?

00:02:10.845 --> 00:02:11.547
Where have you been?

00:02:11.647 --> 00:02:12.982
- [Nami] We went to karaoke and
stuff.

00:02:13.083 --> 00:02:14.853
- Well, okay, but you could've
called

00:02:14.953 --> 00:02:15.420
to let me know you were

00:02:15.521 --> 00:02:16.422
going to be late.
- [Nana K] Mom!

00:02:16.523 --> 00:02:18.293
- Hello, Nana, are you still
there?

00:02:18.393 --> 00:02:20.197
- What on earth made you think I
eloped?

00:02:20.297 --> 00:02:21.065
- [Nami] Hi Nana.

00:02:21.165 --> 00:02:22.067
Nami here.

00:02:22.167 --> 00:02:22.836
- Nami?

00:02:22.936 --> 00:02:23.470
- How'd it going?

00:02:23.571 --> 00:02:25.575
I bet you're loving life in the
big city.

00:02:25.675 --> 00:02:27.411
And how are things with your
boyfriend?

00:02:27.512 --> 00:02:29.281
- Nami, it was you, wasn't it?

00:02:29.382 --> 00:02:30.952
What did you tell mom anyway?

00:02:31.052 --> 00:02:32.421
- Oh, nothing much.

00:02:32.522 --> 00:02:33.758
I just told her you were moving
to Tokyo

00:02:33.858 --> 00:02:35.327
'cause you wanted to live with
some guy.

00:02:35.427 --> 00:02:36.162
That's all.

00:02:36.262 --> 00:02:37.097
- That's not true!

00:02:37.197 --> 00:02:38.266
- You don't have to lie to me.

00:02:38.366 --> 00:02:41.540
It must be so nice to have
sex any time you want.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.276
(Nana K gasping)
(mother gasping)

00:02:43.376 --> 00:02:45.480
- I don't want to hear
that sort of talk from you!

00:02:45.581 --> 00:02:47.017
Go upstairs and take your bath!

00:02:47.117 --> 00:02:47.652
- Huh?

00:02:47.752 --> 00:02:49.589
But I haven't finished talking
to Nana!

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:51.292
And I already took a bath!

00:02:51.392 --> 00:02:53.229
- She's still just a teenager

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:57.104
and she's talking about
sex in front of mom?

00:02:57.204 --> 00:02:58.006
- Hello, Nana?

00:02:58.106 --> 00:03:01.145
Anyway, you're an adult now
and can look after yourself.

00:03:01.245 --> 00:03:03.316
Use the money I gave you however
you want.

00:03:03.416 --> 00:03:04.452
Just as long as you promise you

00:03:04.553 --> 00:03:05.387
won't move back home.

00:03:05.487 --> 00:03:06.456
- Yeah, but what if-

00:03:06.557 --> 00:03:08.627
- [Mother] I've got
enough to deal with, okay?

00:03:08.727 --> 00:03:09.830
Bye for now.

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.802
(phone beeping)

00:03:14.573 --> 00:03:15.373
- Mommy?

00:03:15.474 --> 00:03:18.781
(Nana O laughing)

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:20.918
I don't see what's so funny!

00:03:21.018 --> 00:03:21.520
I thought she'd say,

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.189
"Why don't you come on home,
honey?

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:24.291
I'm worried about you."

00:03:24.391 --> 00:03:26.262
But instead, she tells me not to
move back

00:03:26.362 --> 00:03:27.999
and she thinks I got hitched?

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:29.068
- Yeah, Natsuko.

00:03:29.168 --> 00:03:30.470
The coolest mom around.

00:03:30.571 --> 00:03:31.874
(Nana O giggling)
- Are you drunk?

00:03:31.974 --> 00:03:32.474
Nana.

00:03:32.575 --> 00:03:34.378
- Not yet I'm not.

00:03:34.478 --> 00:03:35.615
- Yeah right.

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:36.315
(door squeaking)

00:03:36.415 --> 00:03:38.921
- I'm back and I got you
cigarettes, Nana.

00:03:39.021 --> 00:03:39.856
(Nana O gasping)
Here.

00:03:39.956 --> 00:03:40.691
- Yasu!

00:03:40.792 --> 00:03:41.325
Welcome home!

00:03:41.425 --> 00:03:42.427
(Yasushi giggling)

00:03:42.529 --> 00:03:44.666
- I see you've been drinking.

00:03:45.233 --> 00:03:46.002
(Nana K gasping)

00:03:46.102 --> 00:03:47.404
- I love you, Yasu.

00:03:47.505 --> 00:03:48.406
- That's very nice.

00:03:48.507 --> 00:03:49.709
(Nana O humming)
Now, will you let go?

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.947
- What happened to Nobuo and
Shin?

00:03:52.047 --> 00:03:54.218
- Well, Nobuo passed out
in the middle of the road,

00:03:54.318 --> 00:03:56.088
so Shin decided to take him
home.

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:56.790
- Oh, I see.

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.763
You mean Nobou went and
got totally hammered?

00:03:59.863 --> 00:04:00.497
- Yeah, but not Shin.

00:04:00.598 --> 00:04:02.234
He's definitely not a
lightweight.

00:04:02.334 --> 00:04:03.838
Drank like a fish.

00:04:03.938 --> 00:04:05.006
Don't fall asleep.

00:04:05.106 --> 00:04:06.510
(Nana O sighing)

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:07.377
Come on.

00:04:07.478 --> 00:04:08.814
Give me a break.

00:04:08.914 --> 00:04:10.283
Let's get you to bed.

00:04:10.383 --> 00:04:11.653
- Thank you.

00:04:13.256 --> 00:04:14.826
- Oh, Nana.

00:04:14.926 --> 00:04:15.628
(bright piano music)

00:04:15.728 --> 00:04:17.699
- [Nana K Voiceover] That's
the first time I've ever seen

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.170
Nana let loose and get drunk.

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:21.907
It was kind of cute.

00:04:22.007 --> 00:04:25.113
She's gotta be so happy
now that Yasu's here.

00:04:25.213 --> 00:04:27.251
She even gave him a big sloppy
kiss

00:04:27.351 --> 00:04:29.121
and said I love you.

00:04:29.221 --> 00:04:31.860
But it didn't seem to surprise
Yasu.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.066
Those two must have something
going on between them.

00:04:36.503 --> 00:04:38.774
But why did they leave the door
open?

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.014
- Sorry about that, Nana.

00:04:43.483 --> 00:04:44.953
Let me help you clean up.

00:04:45.053 --> 00:04:45.588
- That's okay.

00:04:45.688 --> 00:04:47.391
I'm nearly finished anyway.

00:04:47.491 --> 00:04:49.028
- Then throw me a towel.

00:04:49.128 --> 00:04:50.765
I'll start drying.

00:04:50.865 --> 00:04:53.704
(bright music)

00:04:57.645 --> 00:04:59.248
- [Nana K Voiceover] Yasu's so
sweet.

00:04:59.348 --> 00:05:00.150
He may look mean,

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.753
but he's generous and
considerate

00:05:01.853 --> 00:05:03.858
and never brags about stuff.

00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.260
And he's a lawyer, too.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.895
If I get hitched,

00:05:05.995 --> 00:05:08.567
I want it to be to someone just
like him.

00:05:08.667 --> 00:05:10.303
Wait, what am I saying?

00:05:10.403 --> 00:05:12.407
Yasu belongs to Nana!

00:05:12.508 --> 00:05:15.480
Not only that, I've got Shouji.

00:05:15.581 --> 00:05:16.817
- So, is that it?

00:05:16.917 --> 00:05:18.988
Thanks for the dinner and
everything.

00:05:19.088 --> 00:05:21.092
I think I'm gonna head out.

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:25.801
I'll catch ya later, okay?

00:05:25.902 --> 00:05:26.970
- [Nana K] But where are you
going?

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:29.108
- I'm gonna crash at a hotel
just till

00:05:29.208 --> 00:05:31.212
I find a place of my own.

00:05:31.312 --> 00:05:32.381
Shin's staying at Nobuo's,

00:05:32.481 --> 00:05:33.550
so it's kind of crowded there.

00:05:33.651 --> 00:05:35.821
- But why don't you just stay
here?

00:05:35.922 --> 00:05:38.426
- Thanks for the offer, but I'll
pass.

00:05:39.428 --> 00:05:40.397
- It's no big deal!

00:05:40.497 --> 00:05:41.633
You're welcome to stay.

00:05:41.733 --> 00:05:44.038
- [Yasushi] Yeah, well, can't be
helped.

00:05:44.138 --> 00:05:45.440
Goodnight.

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:48.847
- [Nana K Voiceover] What's with
him?

00:05:48.948 --> 00:05:51.052
(Nana O snoring)

00:05:51.152 --> 00:05:53.524
Something weird's going on.

00:05:53.624 --> 00:05:54.726
I know Nana was drunk,

00:05:54.826 --> 00:05:57.732
but she was letting
her true feelings show.

00:05:57.832 --> 00:06:00.771
So why is Yasu acting
like he doesn't care?

00:06:00.871 --> 00:06:01.472
(Nana K gasping)

00:06:01.573 --> 00:06:03.744
Maybe he's got a girlfriend back
home.

00:06:03.844 --> 00:06:04.713
Since he plays in a band,

00:06:04.813 --> 00:06:07.552
I bet he gets a lot of women
after him.

00:06:07.652 --> 00:06:10.390
Well, even if he does
have someone back home,

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:11.793
she can't mean that much to him

00:06:11.893 --> 00:06:14.265
if he left her to come here.

00:06:14.365 --> 00:06:17.104
(light guitar music)

00:06:17.204 --> 00:06:17.772
(Nana K gasping)

00:06:17.872 --> 00:06:20.477
That's exactly what
Shouji did to me!

00:06:21.178 --> 00:06:24.485
(Nana K gasping)

00:06:24.586 --> 00:06:26.823
But things are different with
Shouji.

00:06:26.923 --> 00:06:29.896
Things were really good
between us before he left.

00:06:29.996 --> 00:06:33.771
And then I moved here
because he asked me to.

00:06:33.871 --> 00:06:35.574
(dramatic music)
Or it was only me who

00:06:35.675 --> 00:06:36.610
wanted to move here!

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:39.481
- [Mother] Well, you did
elope, didn't you honey?

00:06:39.582 --> 00:06:40.985
Just promise you won't move back
home.

00:06:41.085 --> 00:06:42.555
- [Nana K Voiceover] But
mom, that's not true!

00:06:42.655 --> 00:06:44.258
I moved here on my own!

00:06:44.358 --> 00:06:46.262
- [Shouji] Nana, you can move in
with me.

00:06:46.362 --> 00:06:47.264
- [Nana K Voiceover] It's all
right.

00:06:47.364 --> 00:06:48.567
It's all right.

00:06:48.667 --> 00:06:51.439
I definitely remember
Shouji saying that to me.

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:53.142
I'm sure if I wanted to settle
down,

00:06:53.242 --> 00:06:55.013
he'd marry me anytime.

00:06:55.113 --> 00:06:58.019
Then again, living together
and getting married

00:06:58.119 --> 00:07:00.558
are two totally different
things.

00:07:00.658 --> 00:07:02.628
And Shouji's only just started
college,

00:07:02.729 --> 00:07:04.431
so that's gonna take four years,

00:07:04.532 --> 00:07:06.335
which is a long time.

00:07:06.435 --> 00:07:08.707
Right now he's just as broke as
I am.

00:07:08.807 --> 00:07:11.178
- [Mother] A wedding's a
once in a lifetime event

00:07:11.278 --> 00:07:12.414
and it costs a lot of money.

00:07:12.515 --> 00:07:13.617
- [Nana K Voiceover] She's
right!

00:07:13.717 --> 00:07:14.786
I don't want a boring wedding!

00:07:14.886 --> 00:07:16.757
I wanna wear a traditional
kimono

00:07:16.857 --> 00:07:18.426
and a cute wedding dress!

00:07:18.527 --> 00:07:19.328
And I don't wanna live in some

00:07:19.428 --> 00:07:21.098
tiny studio apartment.

00:07:21.198 --> 00:07:22.467
I want a big house with a yard,

00:07:22.568 --> 00:07:24.204
or at least a new condo.

00:07:24.304 --> 00:07:25.875
I gotta start saving up!

00:07:25.975 --> 00:07:27.512
I'll put the money my mom gave
me

00:07:27.612 --> 00:07:29.048
into a long-term savings
account.

00:07:29.148 --> 00:07:30.751
Then I'll save up some more on
my own.

00:07:30.851 --> 00:07:32.220
If I work my butt off,

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.189
I should have a lot of cash by

00:07:33.289 --> 00:07:34.893
the time Shouji graduates.

00:07:34.993 --> 00:07:36.028
I'll get the house, Shouji.

00:07:36.128 --> 00:07:37.632
Leave it to me.

00:07:37.732 --> 00:07:39.769
(birds chirping)
(Nana O groaning)

00:07:39.869 --> 00:07:42.775
(metal banging)
- God, my head!

00:07:42.875 --> 00:07:46.148
Damn, I should never have
agreed to go to work today.

00:07:47.885 --> 00:07:49.689
Hachi!

00:07:51.492 --> 00:07:53.196
Aspirin!

00:07:53.997 --> 00:07:55.300
Hachi!

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.870
Where are you?

00:07:57.471 --> 00:07:59.776
(bright music)

00:07:59.876 --> 00:08:00.477
- Oh.

00:08:00.578 --> 00:08:01.278
Morning.

00:08:01.379 --> 00:08:01.847
How are you?

00:08:01.947 --> 00:08:02.949
- What are you wearing that
getup for?

00:08:03.049 --> 00:08:05.353
- I've got a job interview
today.

00:08:05.453 --> 00:08:07.324
They asked me to come in right
away.

00:08:07.424 --> 00:08:08.126
How do I look?

00:08:08.226 --> 00:08:09.829
Think this'll do?

00:08:09.929 --> 00:08:12.401
- When you say interview, what
for?

00:08:12.502 --> 00:08:13.302
- A publisher.

00:08:13.403 --> 00:08:14.171
- What?

00:08:14.271 --> 00:08:14.672
(metal banging)

00:08:14.773 --> 00:08:15.741
(Nana O groaning)
- Nana, what's wrong?

00:08:15.841 --> 00:08:17.144
Are you hungover?

00:08:17.244 --> 00:08:20.350
Let me get you something
for that headache.

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:22.320
- Did I hear you say a
publisher?

00:08:22.421 --> 00:08:24.491
You're not qualified to
work somewhere like that.

00:08:24.592 --> 00:08:26.897
- I've got the basic skills they
need.

00:08:26.997 --> 00:08:29.334
They just want someone to
do admin and run errands.

00:08:29.435 --> 00:08:32.140
Anyway, it's a small company
that no one's ever heard of,

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.176
so it should be fine.

00:08:33.276 --> 00:08:34.211
- [Nana O Voiceover] Yeah, sure.

00:08:34.311 --> 00:08:36.583
As long as they don't go under.

00:08:36.683 --> 00:08:38.754
- Allow me to get you
some water.

00:08:38.854 --> 00:08:41.192
- [Nana O Voiceover] Allow
me to get you some water.

00:08:41.292 --> 00:08:43.864
She even changed her voice
to go with the outfit.

00:08:43.964 --> 00:08:47.104
- So, why do you wanna work for
a publisher all of a sudden?

00:08:47.204 --> 00:08:49.441
- I just came across the ad in
the paper.

00:08:49.542 --> 00:08:51.412
The pay is good, the hours are
good,

00:08:51.513 --> 00:08:52.849
and since I'm living in Tokyo
now,

00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:55.086
I figured it'd be cool to
actually work downtown.

00:08:55.186 --> 00:08:58.459
The idea of working for a
publisher is so exciting!

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.765
Totally cosmopolitan.

00:09:00.865 --> 00:09:03.069
- So you wanna be cosmopolitan
now?

00:09:03.169 --> 00:09:05.106
Well, I'm glad you got off
your butt

00:09:05.206 --> 00:09:07.678
to try and find yourself
a job so quickly.

00:09:07.779 --> 00:09:09.047
I thought all that stuff you
said

00:09:09.148 --> 00:09:11.753
about wanting to make
it on your own was just talk.

00:09:11.853 --> 00:09:14.859
I guess you're starting to
grow up.

00:09:14.959 --> 00:09:16.530
- [Nana K Voiceover] Well, not
really.

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:18.534
My only motivation for finding
another job

00:09:18.634 --> 00:09:21.172
is 'cause I need the
money so bad.

00:09:21.272 --> 00:09:21.907
But whatever the reason,

00:09:22.007 --> 00:09:24.111
if I get a proper job and work
hard at it,

00:09:24.211 --> 00:09:25.948
maybe maturity will be a
nice side effect,

00:09:26.048 --> 00:09:28.954
like killing two birds with
one stone.

00:09:29.054 --> 00:09:30.925
- Hey, where did Yasu go?

00:09:31.025 --> 00:09:33.463
- [Nana K] He said he was
gonna crash at a hotel

00:09:33.564 --> 00:09:35.634
until he can find a place to
live.

00:09:35.734 --> 00:09:37.037
I tried to stop him, but-

00:09:37.137 --> 00:09:38.039
- Whatever.

00:09:38.139 --> 00:09:39.308
- Whatever?

00:09:39.408 --> 00:09:40.544
(Nana O yawning)

00:09:40.644 --> 00:09:42.615
Anyway, I have to go.

00:09:42.715 --> 00:09:44.519
- The band's gonna be rehearsing
later

00:09:44.619 --> 00:09:46.322
on at the same studio as before.

00:09:46.422 --> 00:09:47.859
You wanna come, Hachi?

00:09:47.959 --> 00:09:49.929
- If it's this evening and
I don't have any plans.

00:09:50.029 --> 00:09:51.165
- Then you've gotta come.

00:09:51.265 --> 00:09:53.336
It's gonna be way better
now that we've got

00:09:53.436 --> 00:09:54.304
Yasu back on drums.

00:09:54.404 --> 00:09:57.010
Just wait until you hear the
difference.

00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:58.412
- Okay!

00:09:58.514 --> 00:10:01.252
(upbeat rock music)

00:10:01.352 --> 00:10:03.824
- [Nana K Voiceover]
Nana seems so excited.

00:10:03.924 --> 00:10:06.897
It's great to see her in such a
good mood.

00:10:06.997 --> 00:10:08.199
So now they've got all the

00:10:08.299 --> 00:10:09.836
band members lined up.

00:10:09.936 --> 00:10:10.704
And if they go for it,

00:10:10.804 --> 00:10:12.708
they're gonna make it big,

00:10:12.808 --> 00:10:15.748
which means I gotta go for it,
too!

00:10:20.524 --> 00:10:22.227
(birds chirping)

00:10:22.327 --> 00:10:23.429
- Shouji!

00:10:24.498 --> 00:10:25.366
- Hey Junko!

00:10:25.466 --> 00:10:26.770
Long time no see!

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:27.772
- Tell me about it.

00:10:27.872 --> 00:10:28.807
This is the first time I've ever

00:10:28.907 --> 00:10:29.842
seen you on campus.

00:10:29.943 --> 00:10:31.546
Have you even been to any
classes yet?

00:10:31.646 --> 00:10:33.382
- Ha, ha, you're so funny.

00:10:33.482 --> 00:10:34.251
I'm a serious student now.

00:10:34.351 --> 00:10:36.488
- Shouji, I'm just gonna go on
ahead.

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:37.558
You want me to cover for you?

00:10:37.658 --> 00:10:39.094
- Yeah, sure.

00:10:39.194 --> 00:10:39.762
No.

00:10:39.863 --> 00:10:40.865
- Yes.
- What's it gonna be?

00:10:40.965 --> 00:10:42.935
- Can't you make up your mind?

00:10:43.035 --> 00:10:44.371
- Just play it by ear.

00:10:44.471 --> 00:10:45.975
- [Friend] Yeah, yeah.

00:10:46.075 --> 00:10:48.714
- So, is that the famous
Sachiko?

00:10:48.814 --> 00:10:49.716
- What do you mean famous?

00:10:49.816 --> 00:10:51.018
- Who said that.
- Oh wow.

00:10:51.118 --> 00:10:52.254
- You're totally freaking out.

00:10:52.354 --> 00:10:54.391
That makes it even more
suspicious.

00:10:54.491 --> 00:10:55.293
- Oh, come on!

00:10:55.393 --> 00:10:56.195
Give me a break!

00:10:56.295 --> 00:10:57.063
That damn Kyosuke.

00:10:57.163 --> 00:10:58.199
Why does he have to tell you
everything?

00:10:58.299 --> 00:11:00.436
- Let your smooth talking
friend cover for you in class.

00:11:00.537 --> 00:11:03.944
I think you and me need
to go have a little chat.

00:11:05.948 --> 00:11:08.887
- Hey, Machira, any idea where
Shouji is?

00:11:08.987 --> 00:11:10.189
Have you seen him yet today?

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:10.858
- Yeah.

00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:11.826
I was with him just now,

00:11:11.927 --> 00:11:14.031
but then he bumped into some
girl he knew.

00:11:14.131 --> 00:11:15.099
Looked like they needed to talk,

00:11:15.199 --> 00:11:17.772
so I went on ahead and
left him alone.

00:11:18.406 --> 00:11:20.276
- Oh, really?

00:11:20.376 --> 00:11:21.178
- It's not like that.

00:11:21.278 --> 00:11:23.382
I'm pretty sure it wasn't his
girlfriend.

00:11:23.482 --> 00:11:24.886
Try not to worry about it.

00:11:24.986 --> 00:11:25.988
(Sachiko sighing)

00:11:26.088 --> 00:11:29.696
- Listen, Machira, it's not
like that between me and Shouji.

00:11:29.796 --> 00:11:31.332
We're just good friends, that's
all.

00:11:31.432 --> 00:11:33.002
- Who do you think you're
trying to fool?

00:11:33.102 --> 00:11:35.373
It's totally obvious you
like him.

00:11:35.473 --> 00:11:37.277
To be honest, I thought you
guys were

00:11:37.377 --> 00:11:39.882
already seeing each other
when I first met you.

00:11:39.983 --> 00:11:41.686
Then when I found out
Shouji had a girlfriend,

00:11:41.786 --> 00:11:43.557
I was kind of surprised it
wasn't you.

00:11:43.657 --> 00:11:45.026
- Yeah.

00:11:45.126 --> 00:11:47.397
I only discovered that about
him recently.

00:11:47.497 --> 00:11:49.669
It kind of took me by
surprise as well.

00:11:49.769 --> 00:11:50.604
- He never told you?

00:11:50.704 --> 00:11:51.940
That is so lame of him!

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:53.476
He shouldn't be hiding that.

00:11:53.577 --> 00:11:54.411
- He didn't!

00:11:54.512 --> 00:11:55.681
I just assumed he was single and

00:11:55.781 --> 00:11:56.516
never actually asked him!

00:11:56.616 --> 00:11:59.154
- You're so sweet to make
excuses for him.

00:11:59.254 --> 00:12:00.924
Come and sit by me, Sachiko.

00:12:01.025 --> 00:12:03.697
Forget about Shouji and
go out with me instead.

00:12:03.797 --> 00:12:04.766
- [Sachiko] Why would I sit with
you when

00:12:04.866 --> 00:12:06.235
I'm not even in this class?

00:12:06.335 --> 00:12:08.507
Besides, don't you have
a girlfriend back home?

00:12:08.607 --> 00:12:09.575
Shouji told me all about her.

00:12:09.676 --> 00:12:10.978
- [Kyosuke Voiceover] I
can't believe you told her

00:12:11.078 --> 00:12:12.648
about my love life, Shouji.

00:12:12.748 --> 00:12:14.986
I'll get you for this.

00:12:16.021 --> 00:12:17.357
- Shouji, you're the worst!

00:12:17.457 --> 00:12:19.027
I can't believe you would do
that!

00:12:19.127 --> 00:12:21.599
- Well, I just sort of
forgot to mention it.

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:22.601
And she never asked.

00:12:22.702 --> 00:12:23.937
I wasn't hiding anything from
her.

00:12:24.037 --> 00:12:25.139
- Don't want any excuses.

00:12:25.239 --> 00:12:26.876
You hid the fact you had a
girlfriend

00:12:26.977 --> 00:12:28.346
so you could hit on this other
girl.

00:12:28.446 --> 00:12:28.880
- Junko!

00:12:28.981 --> 00:12:29.949
You know I'm not capable of
doing

00:12:30.049 --> 00:12:31.118
something sneaky like that!

00:12:31.218 --> 00:12:33.155
- Not on purpose, no,
but you're not thinking.

00:12:33.255 --> 00:12:34.458
You're completely clueless!

00:12:34.559 --> 00:12:36.195
Something like this has the
potential

00:12:36.295 --> 00:12:37.898
to break a young girl's heart.

00:12:37.999 --> 00:12:39.368
- You really think I hurt her?

00:12:39.468 --> 00:12:40.169
I don't know.

00:12:40.269 --> 00:12:40.904
- Come on!

00:12:41.005 --> 00:12:42.073
Of course you hurt her!

00:12:42.173 --> 00:12:44.244
Sachiko's fallen in love with
you, right?

00:12:44.344 --> 00:12:46.415
- I think so, but maybe that's
just me

00:12:46.516 --> 00:12:47.217
thinking she loves me.

00:12:47.317 --> 00:12:48.820
She never actually said that she

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:49.522
likes me or anything.

00:12:49.622 --> 00:12:51.593
And nothing's ever happened
between us.

00:12:51.693 --> 00:12:52.628
When we were hanging out,

00:12:52.728 --> 00:12:53.830
it was just as friends.

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:55.099
- Sometimes I wonder if your

00:12:55.199 --> 00:12:56.803
intellectual capabilities ever

00:12:56.903 --> 00:12:59.107
got beyond junior high.

00:12:59.207 --> 00:12:59.876
- Junko!

00:12:59.976 --> 00:13:01.445
Don't just walk away from me!

00:13:01.546 --> 00:13:02.581
I need your advice!

00:13:02.682 --> 00:13:04.484
What should I say to her?

00:13:04.585 --> 00:13:05.554
- You want my advice?

00:13:05.654 --> 00:13:06.623
Stop seeing her.

00:13:06.723 --> 00:13:07.658
The longer you lead her on,

00:13:07.758 --> 00:13:08.660
the worse it's gonna get.

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.329
The only way out
is to break it off

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:11.566
and to do it right now.

00:13:11.666 --> 00:13:13.570
(dramatic music)

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:14.672
- But how can I stop seeing her?

00:13:14.772 --> 00:13:18.179
We work together, we're in
the same classes together.

00:13:18.279 --> 00:13:19.949
- That's not what I mean
and you know it.

00:13:20.049 --> 00:13:20.784
And while you're at it,

00:13:20.884 --> 00:13:21.686
you better figure out a way to

00:13:21.786 --> 00:13:23.289
get things straight with Nana,
too.

00:13:23.389 --> 00:13:26.529
So, Sachiko's more important
to you than Nana now?

00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:27.397
- No!

00:13:27.497 --> 00:13:28.065
That's crazy!

00:13:28.165 --> 00:13:29.167
I haven't done anything
that needs explaining!

00:13:29.267 --> 00:13:30.838
I've got nothing to hide from
Nana!

00:13:30.938 --> 00:13:32.675
- [Junko] Then how come
she seems to suspect

00:13:32.775 --> 00:13:34.679
something's up between you and
Sachiko?

00:13:34.779 --> 00:13:35.279
- What?

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:36.816
- I've heard her talking about
Sachiko

00:13:36.916 --> 00:13:38.085
on more than one occasion.

00:13:38.185 --> 00:13:39.388
Something about her being the

00:13:39.488 --> 00:13:40.456
spawn of the demon lord.

00:13:40.557 --> 00:13:41.091
(Shouji sighing)

00:13:41.191 --> 00:13:42.561
- That's a different Sachiko.

00:13:42.661 --> 00:13:43.697
That's the virtual one.

00:13:43.797 --> 00:13:44.331
- What?

00:13:44.431 --> 00:13:45.834
How'd you come up with a virtual
Sachiko?

00:13:45.934 --> 00:13:46.836
- I don't know!

00:13:46.936 --> 00:13:48.940
Nana's the one who made her up.

00:13:49.809 --> 00:13:51.178
- Listen to me, Shouji.

00:13:51.278 --> 00:13:53.149
I know Nana can be way too much
at times

00:13:53.249 --> 00:13:54.652
and that someone like Sachiko
can

00:13:54.752 --> 00:13:56.255
be a nice comforting escape.

00:13:56.355 --> 00:13:56.956
- Escape?

00:13:57.057 --> 00:13:57.858
That's right, Junko!

00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.194
That's exactly what it is!

00:13:59.294 --> 00:14:01.498
I feel relaxed whenever
I'm around Sachiko.

00:14:01.599 --> 00:14:02.267
It's a total relief.

00:14:02.367 --> 00:14:04.037
- But you knew what Nana was
like

00:14:04.137 --> 00:14:05.139
when you started going out with
her,

00:14:05.239 --> 00:14:06.910
so I don't want you bailing on
her now.

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:07.945
You made a commitment and you

00:14:08.045 --> 00:14:08.680
have to see it through.

00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:10.450
- Well, that is what I'm gonna
do!

00:14:10.551 --> 00:14:12.555
Maybe Kyosuke didn't tell you
this,

00:14:12.655 --> 00:14:13.422
but I wanna marry Nana.

00:14:13.523 --> 00:14:15.627
I wanna go to the grave with
her.

00:14:15.727 --> 00:14:16.495
- Oh please.

00:14:16.596 --> 00:14:18.733
If you share a grave with
that demon lord freak,

00:14:18.834 --> 00:14:20.504
you're never gonna rest in
peace.

00:14:20.604 --> 00:14:21.840
- [Shouji] Junko!

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:24.010
Who's side are you on anyway?

00:14:24.111 --> 00:14:25.881
- Neither.

00:14:25.981 --> 00:14:29.287
Let's just say I'm on the side
of justice.

00:14:31.125 --> 00:14:32.494
- [Shouji Voiceover] Who
does she think she is?

00:14:32.595 --> 00:14:35.099
She's the one who used to run
with a gang.

00:14:35.199 --> 00:14:36.903
- Just wait till I show everyone
those

00:14:37.003 --> 00:14:38.907
photos of her in junior high.

00:14:39.007 --> 00:14:42.080
(playful music)

00:14:47.825 --> 00:14:53.570
(Shouji gasping)
(dramatic music)

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:56.643
- [Shouji Voiceover]
What's she doing here?

00:14:56.743 --> 00:14:57.611
- Shouji!

00:14:57.711 --> 00:14:58.179
Thank goodness!

00:14:58.279 --> 00:14:59.080
I've been looking for you.

00:14:59.181 --> 00:15:00.016
Here's that book I borrowed.

00:15:00.116 --> 00:15:02.287
I thought you'd want it
back as soon as possible.

00:15:02.387 --> 00:15:03.890
Thanks for lending it to me.

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:04.926
- Oh, that's okay.

00:15:05.026 --> 00:15:07.798
You could've returned it
anytime, like at work.

00:15:07.898 --> 00:15:08.767
- I guess you're right.

00:15:08.867 --> 00:15:09.836
Sorry about that.

00:15:09.936 --> 00:15:11.104
- You don't have to apologize.

00:15:11.205 --> 00:15:13.008
It's totally fine.

00:15:16.482 --> 00:15:18.787
So, how long were you standing
there?

00:15:18.887 --> 00:15:19.387
- I'm sorry!

00:15:19.488 --> 00:15:21.391
I didn't mean to eavesdrop,
but I was passing by!

00:15:21.492 --> 00:15:23.128
When I heard your voice,
I wanted to say hi!

00:15:23.229 --> 00:15:24.464
And then when I heard what
you were talking about,

00:15:24.565 --> 00:15:25.500
I just kind of stood there
frozen!

00:15:25.601 --> 00:15:27.437
- Okay, but how long were you
there for?

00:15:27.538 --> 00:15:29.542
- Since she said, "Of course you
hurt her.

00:15:29.642 --> 00:15:32.213
Sachiko's fallen in
love with you."

00:15:33.148 --> 00:15:34.752
Shouji, I'm so, so sorry!

00:15:34.852 --> 00:15:36.121
Are you gonna be all right?

00:15:36.221 --> 00:15:37.525
- Yeah, I think so.

00:15:37.625 --> 00:15:37.892
But just for the record,

00:15:37.992 --> 00:15:39.996
I didn't fall to try and
make you laugh or anything.

00:15:40.096 --> 00:15:41.198
That was for real.

00:15:41.298 --> 00:15:42.701
- [Sachiko] I'm really sorry.

00:15:42.801 --> 00:15:43.603
- No, no.

00:15:43.703 --> 00:15:44.739
You don't have to apologize.

00:15:44.839 --> 00:15:46.341
I mean, it's not your fault.

00:15:46.441 --> 00:15:47.978
It's my fault.

00:15:48.078 --> 00:15:50.349
It's all my fault!

00:15:50.449 --> 00:15:51.318
Bye!

00:15:51.418 --> 00:15:53.055
- [Shouji Voiceover] This is
bad.

00:15:53.155 --> 00:15:54.191
Really bad.

00:15:54.291 --> 00:15:55.159
What am I gonna do?

00:15:55.259 --> 00:15:57.698
I gotta seriously think this
through.

00:15:57.798 --> 00:15:58.667
- The longer you lead her on,

00:15:58.767 --> 00:15:59.535
the worse it's gonna get.

00:15:59.635 --> 00:16:01.071
The only way out is to break it
off

00:16:01.171 --> 00:16:02.508
and do it right now.

00:16:02.608 --> 00:16:03.910
- But I can't just keep running
away

00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:06.516
for the situation, can I,
Kouichi Satou?

00:16:06.616 --> 00:16:07.283
- What?

00:16:07.383 --> 00:16:08.118
- I'm just talking to myself.

00:16:08.219 --> 00:16:10.256
- Well, okay, but when
you tell someone's name,

00:16:10.356 --> 00:16:11.793
they're gonna think
you're talking to them.

00:16:11.893 --> 00:16:13.128
Hey, don't you have class today,
Shouji?

00:16:13.229 --> 00:16:14.164
(Shouji gasping)
Why aren't you there?

00:16:14.264 --> 00:16:15.299
If you're cutting class to come

00:16:15.399 --> 00:16:16.268
and drink this early in the day,

00:16:16.368 --> 00:16:18.072
I'd say you got your priorities
screwed.

00:16:18.172 --> 00:16:18.807
- You're right.

00:16:18.907 --> 00:16:20.176
What am I doing here at
Jackson's

00:16:20.276 --> 00:16:22.313
when I should be at school.

00:16:22.413 --> 00:16:22.748
Oh man.

00:16:22.848 --> 00:16:25.219
Now I see why people drink
to escape their problems.

00:16:25.319 --> 00:16:28.259
I guess I'm already
running away from mine.

00:16:34.004 --> 00:16:36.441
(dreamy music)

00:16:36.542 --> 00:16:38.412
- [Junko Voiceover] So,
Sachiko's more important to you

00:16:38.513 --> 00:16:39.347
than Nana now?

00:16:39.447 --> 00:16:40.884
(Kouichi gasping)
- No way!

00:16:40.984 --> 00:16:43.523
Kouichi Satou, I'm going to work
now!

00:16:43.623 --> 00:16:46.228
I gotta put an end to this
relationship right away!

00:16:46.328 --> 00:16:47.598
I'm gonna make sure I lie in the

00:16:47.698 --> 00:16:49.502
same grave as Nana!

00:16:49.602 --> 00:16:53.309
(sad music)

00:16:53.409 --> 00:16:55.279
- [Shouji Voiceover] Even
when I first met Sachiko,

00:16:55.379 --> 00:16:59.020
I had this feeling I
should stay away from her.

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:01.058
So what am I doing allowing
myself

00:17:01.158 --> 00:17:03.295
to get distracted like this?

00:17:03.395 --> 00:17:06.401
That's exactly what the demon
lord wants.

00:17:06.502 --> 00:17:08.707
But it ain't gonna happen.

00:17:09.642 --> 00:17:12.280
(sad music)

00:17:24.004 --> 00:17:26.174
I won't betray Nana.

00:17:29.247 --> 00:17:30.016
- Hey Sachiko.

00:17:30.116 --> 00:17:31.285
Why do you always change into
sneakers

00:17:31.385 --> 00:17:33.155
after work when you've
got such cute shoes?

00:17:33.255 --> 00:17:34.925
- If I wanna make the last
train,

00:17:35.026 --> 00:17:36.094
I have to run for it.

00:17:36.194 --> 00:17:36.929
- [Woman] Ah.

00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:38.299
Right, okay.

00:17:46.315 --> 00:17:47.183
- Sorry to keep you waiting!

00:17:47.283 --> 00:17:50.122
- Let's go!
- Sachiko, wait!

00:17:50.222 --> 00:17:52.628
- There's something I need to
tell you.

00:17:55.166 --> 00:17:58.472
(Sachiko sighing)

00:17:59.742 --> 00:18:01.211
Don't make that face.

00:18:01.311 --> 00:18:03.516
- [Shouji Voiceover] I'll
try not to look at her.

00:18:03.616 --> 00:18:05.219
- [Shouji] Let's walk while we
talk.

00:18:05.319 --> 00:18:06.455
And please, hear me out.

00:18:06.556 --> 00:18:07.490
If you miss the last train,

00:18:07.591 --> 00:18:09.628
I'll give you the cab fair,
okay?

00:18:09.729 --> 00:18:12.500
(dog barking)

00:18:27.831 --> 00:18:30.202
- [Shouji Voiceover] How am I
supposed to break up with her?

00:18:30.302 --> 00:18:31.471
What should I say?

00:18:31.572 --> 00:18:34.177
She's not even my
girlfriend to begin with.

00:18:34.277 --> 00:18:35.279
Just a friend!

00:18:35.379 --> 00:18:37.651
So I can't tell her we're
breaking up.

00:18:37.751 --> 00:18:38.720
That'll be weird.

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:41.224
Do I tell her we can't be
friends anymore?

00:18:41.324 --> 00:18:43.663
But she hasn't done anything
wrong.

00:18:43.763 --> 00:18:45.867
She's such a sweet girl.

00:18:45.967 --> 00:18:47.838
What the hell am I doing?

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:50.409
Anyway, I have to say something.

00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:52.648
(Sachiko gasping)
- You know!

00:18:52.748 --> 00:18:58.459
(sad piano music)
(Sachiko crying)

00:19:04.739 --> 00:19:05.807
I'm sorry.

00:19:05.907 --> 00:19:07.343
I'm really sorry.

00:19:07.443 --> 00:19:09.381
- It's not your fault, Shouji.

00:19:09.481 --> 00:19:11.017
I'm the one to blame.

00:19:11.118 --> 00:19:11.953
It was me.

00:19:12.053 --> 00:19:14.257
I got my hopes up, that's all.

00:19:14.357 --> 00:19:15.359
(Shouji sighing)

00:19:15.459 --> 00:19:17.230
I did it on purpose.

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:20.336
But I'll try not to interfere.

00:19:20.436 --> 00:19:21.506
I won't ever get in the way of

00:19:21.606 --> 00:19:25.947
your relationship with
your girlfriend, I promise.

00:19:26.047 --> 00:19:32.326
So, please Shouji, why
can't we just be friends?

00:19:32.427 --> 00:19:34.765
I don't want you to start
avoiding me!

00:19:34.865 --> 00:19:37.170
(Shouji sighing)

00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:39.775
(Sachiko crying)

00:19:39.875 --> 00:19:43.148
(sad piano music)

00:19:43.248 --> 00:19:46.656
(cellphone ringing)

00:19:49.829 --> 00:19:51.031
- There's no answer.

00:19:51.131 --> 00:19:52.768
Weird.

00:19:52.868 --> 00:19:54.270
Shouji should've finished work
by now,

00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:56.208
but it's going to voicemail.

00:19:56.308 --> 00:19:58.312
Maybe his phone's dead.

00:19:58.412 --> 00:19:59.915
I wanted to tell him the news
about

00:20:00.015 --> 00:20:01.318
me getting a brand new job.

00:20:01.418 --> 00:20:02.988
- What if he's cheating on you?

00:20:03.088 --> 00:20:03.890
- He wouldn't cheat on me!

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:04.825
He's not like that!

00:20:04.925 --> 00:20:05.426
(Nana O sighing)

00:20:05.527 --> 00:20:06.261
I'll just text him instead.

00:20:06.361 --> 00:20:07.531
- It's great you got a job and
all,

00:20:07.631 --> 00:20:09.702
but I gotta wonder why a company
like that

00:20:09.802 --> 00:20:10.570
would hire you.

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:12.406
They must be desperate
for staff or something.

00:20:12.508 --> 00:20:13.442
- You know what they told me?

00:20:13.543 --> 00:20:15.179
If I can learn about the
publishing biz

00:20:15.279 --> 00:20:15.714
while I'm on the job,

00:20:15.814 --> 00:20:16.916
they might give me a promotion
to

00:20:17.016 --> 00:20:19.020
something in the editorial
department.

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:20.189
So I'm gonna work really hard.

00:20:20.289 --> 00:20:23.530
- They sure got you stoked
about this job, didn't they?

00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:25.399
- [Nana K] When I'm
promoted, I'll get a bonus,

00:20:25.499 --> 00:20:26.803
which means I'll be one step
closer

00:20:26.903 --> 00:20:29.407
to my dream of buying a
big house with a yard.

00:20:29.508 --> 00:20:31.178
- [Nana O] A big house with a
yard?

00:20:31.278 --> 00:20:32.313
That's your dream?

00:20:32.413 --> 00:20:33.148
- [Nana K] Yup.

00:20:33.248 --> 00:20:35.019
It's what I've always wanted.

00:20:36.656 --> 00:20:38.893
- When I become a rich and
famous singer,

00:20:38.993 --> 00:20:40.229
I'll buy you one.

00:20:40.329 --> 00:20:41.231
(Nana K gasping)

00:20:41.331 --> 00:20:43.001
(romantic violin music)

00:20:43.101 --> 00:20:45.674
But your room's gonna be the
doghouse out in the yard.

00:20:45.774 --> 00:20:50.750
(Nana K whining)
(Nana O giggling)

00:20:50.851 --> 00:20:52.554
- [Nana K Voiceover] If Nana was
a guy,

00:20:52.654 --> 00:20:55.426
she'd be the love of my life.

00:20:55.527 --> 00:20:58.566
Well, I often thought that back
then.

00:21:00.302 --> 00:21:02.473
But if that really was the case,

00:21:02.574 --> 00:21:03.643
I wouldn't have experienced such

00:21:03.743 --> 00:21:06.047
happy times and memories.

00:21:07.383 --> 00:21:11.191
Because love and pain are
inseparable.

00:21:11.291 --> 00:21:14.397
It's more painful as you drown
in it.
