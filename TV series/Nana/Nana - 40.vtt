WEBVTT

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:06.435
- [Narrator] The moment
I saw your empty room.

00:00:06.536 --> 00:00:11.278
It felt like I'd wandered into
a world where only I existed.

00:00:11.378 --> 00:00:13.984
I was lost and all alone.

00:00:15.086 --> 00:00:18.392
(rock band music)

00:01:57.992 --> 00:01:59.629
- What? She moved?

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.367
- Yeah. Her new place is
pretty far away from here too.

00:02:02.467 --> 00:02:05.473
- But you said to say hi
to everyone at Jackson's.

00:02:05.574 --> 00:02:06.075
- Wait a minute.

00:02:06.175 --> 00:02:06.943
You serious?

00:02:07.043 --> 00:02:08.112
Oh, I'm really gonna miss her.

00:02:08.212 --> 00:02:08.981
- Hold on.

00:02:09.081 --> 00:02:10.283
Who did you say is moving?

00:02:10.383 --> 00:02:12.387
- Nana Komatsu to Shirogane.

00:02:12.487 --> 00:02:14.792
- Why is she moving there?

00:02:14.892 --> 00:02:17.264
- Miyamioyamon, Hiro, Asobu...

00:02:17.364 --> 00:02:19.969
- Any one of those places
would've been great

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:21.105
for her to live in.

00:02:21.205 --> 00:02:22.642
- Those are all the ritzy
parts of town.

00:02:22.742 --> 00:02:24.077
- But I knew right from the
beginning

00:02:24.177 --> 00:02:26.181
that Nana would choose
Shirogane.

00:02:26.282 --> 00:02:26.950
- Why's that?

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.624
- Because that's where all
newly weds dream of living.

00:02:30.724 --> 00:02:32.093
- Newly weds?

00:02:32.193 --> 00:02:33.563
- Yep. Young wives.

00:02:33.664 --> 00:02:36.468
Love to roll with the
Shirogane crowd.

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.838
- What the hell?

00:02:37.938 --> 00:02:39.041
You know, to tell you the truth

00:02:39.141 --> 00:02:39.942
I'm kind of relieved.

00:02:40.043 --> 00:02:43.249
Besides Nana's gonna look
hot in a wedding dress.

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:44.619
- But even if it is for
the sake of her baby,

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:48.125
how can she marry someone
she's not even in love with?

00:02:48.225 --> 00:02:48.727
- Come on.

00:02:48.827 --> 00:02:51.231
She wouldn't get married if
she didn't in love the guy.

00:02:51.332 --> 00:02:52.434
- But what about Nobuo?

00:02:52.535 --> 00:02:54.806
- My guess is she's in
love with both of them.

00:02:54.906 --> 00:02:58.079
I'm pretty sure that's
something you can relate to.

00:02:58.179 --> 00:02:59.816
- I'm home.

00:02:59.916 --> 00:03:00.383
Oh, you're here.

00:03:00.483 --> 00:03:02.320
What Shoji did you finally

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.525
run outta money to drink
at Jackson's?

00:03:04.625 --> 00:03:07.598
- Here's to Nana for
marrying some rich guy.

00:03:07.698 --> 00:03:08.633
- So you heard?

00:03:08.734 --> 00:03:11.438
While I doubt she'll
send you an invite.

00:03:12.775 --> 00:03:15.814
- But seriously paying
a million yen in rent.

00:03:15.914 --> 00:03:17.785
Just how rich is this guy?

00:03:17.885 --> 00:03:19.454
- Actually it's 700,000.

00:03:19.555 --> 00:03:22.360
She just told him if he has
that much money to blow on rent,

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.297
he should be saving
it for their baby.

00:03:24.398 --> 00:03:26.803
Our little Nana is
actually growing up.

00:03:26.903 --> 00:03:28.507
- I suppose that's the
power of motherhood.

00:03:28.607 --> 00:03:31.011
- But 700,000 yen is still
a lot of money.

00:03:31.111 --> 00:03:33.015
What does this guy do?

00:03:33.115 --> 00:03:35.521
- He's a musician.

00:03:35.621 --> 00:03:38.694
- Oh man. Another one
of the gurus peeps.

00:03:38.794 --> 00:03:41.599
- Well kind of, I know
he is friends with Yasu.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.438
- If Yasu is friends with
him, then he should be cool.

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:46.341
- But if he has that
much money that means

00:03:46.442 --> 00:03:47.477
he must be playing in a band

00:03:47.578 --> 00:03:49.949
that's making way more
cash than Blast.

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:51.218
Is this guy famous?

00:03:51.318 --> 00:03:53.355
- Nah, you gotta be
seriously famous

00:03:53.456 --> 00:03:54.826
to make a lot of money in music.

00:03:54.926 --> 00:03:57.097
It makes much more sense
that this guy comes

00:03:57.197 --> 00:03:58.332
from a rich family.

00:03:58.432 --> 00:03:59.401
- Yeah. Do you really think

00:03:59.502 --> 00:04:01.271
that a famous person
would wanna get married

00:04:01.372 --> 00:04:02.440
to someone like Nana?

00:04:02.541 --> 00:04:05.213
Besides you know that if this
guy was even slightly famous

00:04:05.313 --> 00:04:07.217
Nana would be letting
the whole world know.

00:04:07.317 --> 00:04:07.818
- But that's just, it.

00:04:07.918 --> 00:04:09.956
Maybe she's been forced
to keep it a secret

00:04:10.056 --> 00:04:11.760
because he is a celebrity.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.295
- What's his name?

00:04:13.396 --> 00:04:15.032
- Takumi.

00:04:15.133 --> 00:04:16.970
- Oh Takumi is so hot!

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.207
- From Trap Nest?

00:04:20.544 --> 00:04:21.980
- There's no way.

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.449
Are you crazy?

00:04:26.422 --> 00:04:29.562
- What are you doing
following me?

00:04:29.662 --> 00:04:30.463
Just go home.

00:04:30.564 --> 00:04:31.498
- See you guys tomorrow.

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:33.202
- Come on, dude.
I won't stay long.

00:04:33.302 --> 00:04:36.041
Just let me see Hachiko
this one time.

00:04:36.141 --> 00:04:37.511
- All right, fine.

00:04:40.016 --> 00:04:41.251
- Good evening, sir.

00:04:41.351 --> 00:04:42.220
- Fancy place.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.590
And it's brand new, right?

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.594
Man, the rent must be expensive.

00:04:45.694 --> 00:04:47.430
- Yeah. It's close to
the train station too.

00:04:47.531 --> 00:04:48.800
- You never take the train,

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.973
but this place is like
a fortress of solitude.

00:04:52.942 --> 00:04:53.510
Hold on a minute.

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.514
We've been held up in
the studio recording.

00:04:55.614 --> 00:04:57.618
So is this your first time here?

00:04:57.718 --> 00:05:01.058
- No, I had to come here when
I first signed the lease.

00:05:01.158 --> 00:05:01.760
- Oh really?

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.897
- I had to see for myself
what the neighborhood was like

00:05:03.997 --> 00:05:06.235
and if the security
system was good enough,

00:05:06.335 --> 00:05:08.239
it's gotta be safe.

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:09.241
- [Nana] Hello?

00:05:09.341 --> 00:05:10.343
- I'm home.

00:05:10.443 --> 00:05:13.015
- [Nana] Oh, welcome home.

00:05:13.984 --> 00:05:15.386
- She was stuttering.

00:05:15.486 --> 00:05:16.355
That's so cute.

00:05:16.455 --> 00:05:18.960
- You seem to be having fun,
aren't you?

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.796
- we're newly weds,

00:05:19.896 --> 00:05:21.666
but you're not illegally
married yet.

00:05:21.766 --> 00:05:22.968
How serious are you about this?

00:05:23.068 --> 00:05:25.507
You still got that
apartment in Osaka, right?

00:05:25.607 --> 00:05:26.943
Are you guys gonna live
separately?

00:05:27.043 --> 00:05:27.578
- Shut up.

00:05:27.678 --> 00:05:30.016
I'll move out of that
place eventually.

00:05:30.116 --> 00:05:31.451
- Eventually?

00:05:31.553 --> 00:05:35.259
(instrumental music)

00:05:36.295 --> 00:05:38.399
- Each floor has its own
locked door?

00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:40.504
Tight security.

00:05:40.604 --> 00:05:42.975
- I'm not home very often.

00:05:43.075 --> 00:05:45.781
This way I know Nana
and the baby are safe.

00:05:45.881 --> 00:05:46.516
- Good idea.

00:05:46.616 --> 00:05:48.486
Your fans are seriously wacko.

00:05:48.587 --> 00:05:51.893
- Why do people get fixated
on chasing an illusion?

00:05:51.993 --> 00:05:53.128
Never understand it.

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:54.899
- Because it's an illusion.

00:05:56.101 --> 00:05:57.938
Out there in the real world,

00:05:58.038 --> 00:05:59.241
you'll never come across anyone

00:05:59.341 --> 00:06:01.913
who's as perfect as
you imagine them to be.

00:06:04.317 --> 00:06:05.888
But what I don't get
is the fact that

00:06:05.988 --> 00:06:08.359
you're marrying the
exact type of woman

00:06:08.459 --> 00:06:10.396
you have trouble understanding.

00:06:11.398 --> 00:06:12.467
- Nana knows that reality

00:06:12.568 --> 00:06:15.006
and illusions are two
different things.

00:06:15.106 --> 00:06:16.108
Cause she's figured that out.

00:06:16.208 --> 00:06:18.713
She can still dream
without getting depressed.

00:06:18.813 --> 00:06:20.316
That's what's so cute about her.

00:06:20.416 --> 00:06:22.453
- Hey, I'm just like Hachiko
right?

00:06:22.555 --> 00:06:24.659
And that means you
think I'm cute.

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:25.393
Takumi?

00:06:25.493 --> 00:06:27.565
- Don't make me smack you.

00:06:29.902 --> 00:06:30.369
- [Nana] Hello?

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:31.305
- It's me.

00:06:31.405 --> 00:06:33.442
- Wow. What am I gonna do?

00:06:33.543 --> 00:06:35.279
I'm getting all nervous.

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:37.050
- You better not stay very long.

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:38.987
This is our first night married.

00:06:39.087 --> 00:06:39.555
- But you're not married

00:06:39.655 --> 00:06:42.126
and this isn't your
first night together.

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:45.099
- Welcome home.

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:46.101
- Well, good evening.

00:06:46.201 --> 00:06:47.538
- What are doing?

00:06:51.478 --> 00:06:53.583
- Good evening.

00:06:53.683 --> 00:06:55.587
- I can't believe
how cute she is.

00:06:55.687 --> 00:06:57.858
- You satisfied? Now go home.

00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:01.064
(soft jazz music)

00:07:02.033 --> 00:07:03.335
- It's like a palace.

00:07:03.435 --> 00:07:06.643
- What's wrong with you?

00:07:06.743 --> 00:07:09.347
- You guys must be exhausted
after the recording.

00:07:09.447 --> 00:07:10.817
- You're so adorable.

00:07:10.918 --> 00:07:13.723
- Would you like to
stay for dinner with us?

00:07:13.823 --> 00:07:14.024
- Yes.

00:07:14.124 --> 00:07:17.163
- But didn't you tell me you
had to be somewhere else.

00:07:17.263 --> 00:07:18.934
- Oh.

00:07:19.034 --> 00:07:20.671
- It's all prepared and
ready to eat.

00:07:20.771 --> 00:07:22.841
And I went a bit
overboard as usual.

00:07:22.942 --> 00:07:25.814
So it'd be really great
if you could join us.

00:07:27.417 --> 00:07:28.920
- Of course.

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:32.126
(soft jazz music)

00:07:35.601 --> 00:07:38.439
- Wow. Everything looks amazing.

00:07:39.441 --> 00:07:40.443
It's so good.

00:07:40.544 --> 00:07:42.380
- He really like it, I'm glad.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:43.315
- You're a great cook.

00:07:43.415 --> 00:07:44.552
Just like I'd heard.

00:07:44.652 --> 00:07:46.889
It's no wonder this
guy wants to marry you.

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:47.591
- You idiot.

00:07:47.691 --> 00:07:50.263
That is not why I
decided to marry her.

00:07:50.363 --> 00:07:52.433
I would've just hired a
cook for that.

00:07:52.534 --> 00:07:54.437
- Yeah, but there aren't
many chicks nowadays

00:07:54.538 --> 00:07:56.776
who can cook up a
spread like this.

00:07:56.876 --> 00:07:59.014
And not only that, all the
furnishing and decorating

00:07:59.114 --> 00:08:01.786
in this place must have been
hard to pull off so quickly.

00:08:01.886 --> 00:08:03.289
- Actually, I had
everything done

00:08:03.389 --> 00:08:06.763
by a professional interior
decorator before we moved in,

00:08:06.863 --> 00:08:09.367
but it was hard to convey
all my ideas to them.

00:08:09.467 --> 00:08:12.240
So it turned out pretty fancy.

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:12.875
- I see.

00:08:12.975 --> 00:08:14.645
- Well, you can slowly
change things around

00:08:14.745 --> 00:08:16.348
and make it more your style.

00:08:16.448 --> 00:08:17.350
Hey, that reminds me.

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:20.724
You didn't get rid of all
your old furniture, did you?

00:08:20.824 --> 00:08:20.991
- Oh no.

00:08:21.091 --> 00:08:24.097
I used all of it to
decorate the special room.

00:08:24.197 --> 00:08:24.865
- Your bedroom?

00:08:24.966 --> 00:08:27.571
- No, it's gonna be turned
into the baby's nursery.

00:08:27.671 --> 00:08:29.809
The furniture's solid,
but not too fancy.

00:08:29.909 --> 00:08:31.879
I just had the wallpaper
changed and you wouldn't

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:34.017
believe how cute the
room looks now.

00:08:34.117 --> 00:08:34.719
- Let's take a look.

00:08:34.819 --> 00:08:36.221
- Really, you want to?

00:08:38.292 --> 00:08:39.194
- It's so cute!

00:08:39.294 --> 00:08:40.496
- It is, isn't it?

00:08:40.597 --> 00:08:42.200
- Thank you, mommy.

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:44.204
- A floral pattern?

00:08:44.304 --> 00:08:45.507
- And what's so wrong with that,

00:08:45.607 --> 00:08:47.076
it is the princess' room?

00:08:47.176 --> 00:08:50.082
- And what are we gonna
do if the baby is a boy?

00:08:51.719 --> 00:08:52.721
- What are we gonna do?

00:08:52.821 --> 00:08:55.259
I always just assumed that
I was gonna have a girl.

00:08:55.359 --> 00:08:56.596
- That I'm sure it will be.

00:08:56.696 --> 00:08:57.665
(laughter)

00:08:57.765 --> 00:08:59.134
- I just don't get it.

00:08:59.234 --> 00:09:00.504
What made you so
sure about that?

00:09:00.604 --> 00:09:03.175
- I'm sorry, I got carried away.

00:09:03.275 --> 00:09:04.110
- No, it's fine.

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:06.883
We can change the
wallpaper if we want

00:09:06.983 --> 00:09:09.454
or I suppose we could
always just keep trying

00:09:09.555 --> 00:09:10.891
until we do get a girl.

00:09:10.991 --> 00:09:12.026
- Oh.

00:09:13.997 --> 00:09:17.136
- Well then I think
I'll leave you too alone

00:09:17.236 --> 00:09:18.405
and head on home.

00:09:18.506 --> 00:09:20.744
- You can just ask
the front desk

00:09:20.844 --> 00:09:22.380
and they'll call a cab for you.

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:24.417
- Great. Thanks for having me
over

00:09:24.518 --> 00:09:26.021
and thanks for the amazing
dinner.

00:09:26.121 --> 00:09:28.058
- Please come again
anytime, okay?

00:09:28.158 --> 00:09:30.062
- Next time I'll come when he's
not here.

00:09:30.162 --> 00:09:33.703
- Oh wait, don't even
talk about that.

00:09:33.803 --> 00:09:35.239
- Naoki's a cool guy.

00:09:35.339 --> 00:09:36.609
I never knew he was so funny.

00:09:36.709 --> 00:09:38.613
I could imagine us
becoming friends.

00:09:38.713 --> 00:09:40.449
I'm happy, I got to meet him.

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:41.385
- Is that right?

00:09:41.485 --> 00:09:43.322
All he does is wear me out.

00:09:43.422 --> 00:09:45.025
Could you draw me a bath?

00:09:45.126 --> 00:09:46.729
- Oh, I already did.

00:09:47.898 --> 00:09:48.933
- You know, you don't
have to try

00:09:49.033 --> 00:09:51.104
and be the perfect
wife all the time.

00:09:51.204 --> 00:09:54.077
Let's take a bath together
and we can both relax.

00:09:54.177 --> 00:09:56.783
- Well, that might make you feel
relaxed.

00:10:01.793 --> 00:10:03.262
- Did you lose weight?

00:10:04.932 --> 00:10:07.604
- I did, about six pounds.

00:10:07.704 --> 00:10:09.240
- Your morning sickness is that
bad?

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:12.080
- But moving seems to have
been a good change of pace.

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:15.252
So these past few days I've
been feeling a lot better.

00:10:15.352 --> 00:10:17.490
Anyway, I was getting a bit
chubby before

00:10:17.591 --> 00:10:19.094
so it works out perfectly.

00:10:19.194 --> 00:10:20.664
- Yeah, I guess so.

00:10:20.764 --> 00:10:24.070
I'm sure once the
morning sickness is over,

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:25.039
you'll get chubby again.

00:10:25.139 --> 00:10:25.974
- No way.

00:10:26.074 --> 00:10:28.312
- I bet you'll get really fat.

00:10:28.412 --> 00:10:29.481
- What will I do?

00:10:29.582 --> 00:10:31.017
I gain weight so easily.

00:10:31.118 --> 00:10:33.690
Both my big sister and
my mom are kind of fat

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:35.527
and my little sister has to work
so hard

00:10:35.627 --> 00:10:37.130
to keep her figure
looking petite.

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:39.434
- How many siblings do
you have anyway?

00:10:39.535 --> 00:10:40.570
- There's three of us.

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:41.839
- All girls?

00:10:41.939 --> 00:10:44.210
Wow. That's kinda scary.

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:46.849
- We're not scary,
especially not my big sister.

00:10:46.949 --> 00:10:48.185
She's nice, like a Buddha.

00:10:48.285 --> 00:10:51.893
- So did you tell
your parents yet?

00:10:51.993 --> 00:10:56.034
- Yeah, I called my
mom the other day.

00:10:56.836 --> 00:10:58.940
- How much did you tell her?

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:05.252
- That I'm pregnant and
that I might get married?

00:11:05.352 --> 00:11:07.858
- What do you mean
might get married.

00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:10.362
Don't you believe me when I
say we're getting married?

00:11:10.463 --> 00:11:11.699
- Yeah. But...

00:11:11.799 --> 00:11:12.601
- Oh well.

00:11:12.701 --> 00:11:15.406
And what did mama
say to all that?

00:11:15.507 --> 00:11:16.074
- Mama?

00:11:16.174 --> 00:11:20.650
Well, she said, "Oh wow.
Congratulations."

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:22.654
"You finally did it."

00:11:22.754 --> 00:11:25.927
- What kind of mother is she?

00:11:26.027 --> 00:11:27.865
- Well, that's just how she is.

00:11:27.965 --> 00:11:28.933
- And what about your dad?

00:11:29.033 --> 00:11:31.271
I bet he was really
furious when he heard.

00:11:31.371 --> 00:11:32.106
- Not really.

00:11:32.206 --> 00:11:34.712
He called me right after
I talked to my mom.

00:11:34.812 --> 00:11:36.983
He was more shocked
really than anything else.

00:11:37.083 --> 00:11:39.822
He just called me names,
like my stupid daughter.

00:11:39.922 --> 00:11:41.358
And he asked what kind
of guy you are.

00:11:41.458 --> 00:11:43.730
So I told him you were
in the music industry

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:45.834
and you know what he said?

00:11:45.934 --> 00:11:48.673
- If he owns a karaoke
bar, we can sing for free.

00:11:48.773 --> 00:11:50.009
- I don't think he got it.

00:11:50.109 --> 00:11:51.011
(laughter)

00:11:51.111 --> 00:11:52.848
So I just avoided
the whole issue

00:11:52.948 --> 00:11:55.620
by saying no, he makes music.

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:56.454
- Avoided what issue?

00:11:56.556 --> 00:11:59.060
- If they found out that
you're Takumi from Trap Nest,

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.198
I know my little sister
would freak out

00:12:01.298 --> 00:12:01.866
and tell her friends.

00:12:01.966 --> 00:12:03.268
And it'd be a big gossip fest.

00:12:03.368 --> 00:12:06.676
Besides there's no way I could
tell them before I tell Jun.

00:12:06.776 --> 00:12:07.376
- And who's Jun?

00:12:07.476 --> 00:12:09.548
- She takes care of
me, just like a mother.

00:12:09.648 --> 00:12:11.251
Even more than my real mom.

00:12:11.351 --> 00:12:14.090
She lectures me a lot,
but I know it's with love.

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:16.361
Who knows, maybe I'm Jun's kid.

00:12:16.461 --> 00:12:19.500
- You don't have to hide
us from your family.

00:12:19.602 --> 00:12:21.071
I've cleared it with the agency.

00:12:21.171 --> 00:12:24.377
- We'll send out a press release
when we make it official.

00:12:24.477 --> 00:12:26.214
It's not like we have
anything to hide.

00:12:26.314 --> 00:12:28.318
There's no point in making
a big deal out of this

00:12:28.418 --> 00:12:29.020
since you're not a celebrity.

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:31.559
"This is my wife, now
leave her alone."

00:12:31.659 --> 00:12:32.995
Something like that.

00:12:33.095 --> 00:12:35.299
I've kept this
coming Sunday open.

00:12:35.399 --> 00:12:37.203
Tell your parents we're
coming for a visit

00:12:37.303 --> 00:12:38.806
so I can meet them.

00:12:38.907 --> 00:12:40.644
Oh, also I want to talk
to them about what date

00:12:40.744 --> 00:12:42.113
would work best for them.

00:12:42.213 --> 00:12:43.382
I'd rather make it sooner
than later,

00:12:43.482 --> 00:12:46.454
cause you're gonna
start showing any day now.

00:12:49.862 --> 00:12:53.803
(cellphone ringing)

00:12:53.903 --> 00:12:56.174
- "I went over to Takumi's
new pad.

00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:58.746
Hachiko is so cute.

00:12:58.846 --> 00:13:01.418
And Takumi is really
sweet with her.

00:13:01.519 --> 00:13:03.590
I think it's all good, there's
nothing to worry about.

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:04.959
Good night."

00:13:06.896 --> 00:13:09.467
- You woke me up for that?

00:13:11.839 --> 00:13:14.812
(Reira crying)

00:13:16.549 --> 00:13:19.320
(piano music)

00:13:31.545 --> 00:13:32.547
- You'll catch a cold.

00:13:32.648 --> 00:13:34.284
Why don't you smoke inside?

00:13:34.384 --> 00:13:35.553
- It's all right.

00:13:35.654 --> 00:13:36.856
I'm just having one.

00:13:36.956 --> 00:13:37.891
I don't want the little princess

00:13:37.991 --> 00:13:39.962
inside you to start hating me.

00:13:40.062 --> 00:13:42.668
- You know, I really enjoyed
that.

00:13:42.768 --> 00:13:44.237
Taking a bath together.

00:13:44.337 --> 00:13:45.974
It seemed like we felt
more comfortable

00:13:46.074 --> 00:13:47.844
and really opened up
to each other.

00:13:47.944 --> 00:13:50.182
We should do that
more often, okay?

00:13:50.282 --> 00:13:52.587
- Oh, so you like doing
it in tight spaces?

00:13:52.688 --> 00:13:56.194
You have to tell me important
things like that, all right?

00:14:12.426 --> 00:14:15.834
(cellphone ringing)

00:14:21.044 --> 00:14:24.450
(cellphone ringing)

00:14:26.589 --> 00:14:29.394
- Oh. Hey Hachi, how's it going?

00:14:30.295 --> 00:14:31.866
- Hey.

00:14:31.966 --> 00:14:33.803
- Sorry for calling so late.

00:14:33.903 --> 00:14:36.207
You probably have work
in the morning.

00:14:38.913 --> 00:14:40.249
- No.

00:14:40.349 --> 00:14:43.255
- Not that it's my business,
but I haven't seen you

00:14:43.355 --> 00:14:46.829
since that night we set
off the fireworks.

00:14:46.929 --> 00:14:48.866
I was just wondering how you're
doing.

00:14:48.966 --> 00:14:50.737
The fireworks were a lot
of fun, weren't they?

00:14:50.837 --> 00:14:53.776
It was the first time I'd
ever done something like that.

00:14:53.876 --> 00:14:57.918
Oh. And when we made wishes
on those strips of paper?

00:14:58.018 --> 00:14:59.621
The summer was so great.

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:05.533
So do you think they still
sell those fireworks?

00:15:05.633 --> 00:15:08.372
We should all get together
and light some.

00:15:13.549 --> 00:15:14.885
- I'm sorry Shin.

00:15:14.985 --> 00:15:16.254
- What for?

00:15:18.225 --> 00:15:20.162
- Because I'm a traitor.

00:15:21.599 --> 00:15:24.505
I can't hang out with
you guys anymore.

00:15:25.038 --> 00:15:28.245
(Nana crying)

00:15:28.345 --> 00:15:30.650
- Listen, no matter what's
happened.

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:32.554
I'm always on your side.

00:15:36.061 --> 00:15:38.065
- Nana, where's the hair dryer?

00:15:43.341 --> 00:15:45.747
- I'm so sorry Jun have a
good night.

00:15:45.847 --> 00:15:47.116
- Found it.

00:15:59.273 --> 00:16:00.342
What's the matter,

00:16:00.442 --> 00:16:03.583
did she start lecturing
you about something again?

00:16:08.058 --> 00:16:11.397
- I just got a little
homesick that's all.

00:16:12.667 --> 00:16:16.107
- Never, ever mention
that name again.

00:16:16.207 --> 00:16:17.443
Even Nobuo has a thing or two

00:16:17.544 --> 00:16:20.182
that he doesn't want
to talk about.

00:16:24.023 --> 00:16:26.227
- So that's what's going on.

00:16:37.183 --> 00:16:39.120
- [Nana] Because I'm a traitor.

00:16:40.189 --> 00:16:44.330
I can't hang out with
you guys anymore.

00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:46.735
- I like to think that
people are bound by trust.

00:16:46.836 --> 00:16:50.342
It doesn't matter what kind
of relationship they're in.

00:16:53.983 --> 00:16:55.352
- [Nana] I'm sorry.

00:16:56.789 --> 00:16:59.661
Could you give me Yasu's number?

00:16:59.761 --> 00:17:02.934
- [Yasu] Reira was in
love with Takumi.

00:17:03.034 --> 00:17:07.376
Now looking back, I know it
was nothing but petty jealousy.

00:17:08.378 --> 00:17:10.015
I wasn't there for her to
lean on

00:17:10.115 --> 00:17:12.587
when she needed
me the most.

00:17:12.687 --> 00:17:16.060
- But Yasu you could try
to be there for her now.

00:17:17.597 --> 00:17:21.237
- Right now I have my hands
full taken care of you guys.

00:17:25.345 --> 00:17:26.247
- Shin?

00:17:26.347 --> 00:17:27.584
- Ren, why are you here?

00:17:27.684 --> 00:17:28.519
- Listen.

00:17:28.619 --> 00:17:30.155
It's really good to see
you guys again,

00:17:30.255 --> 00:17:32.193
but I can't stick around.

00:17:32.293 --> 00:17:33.930
I gotta take off right away.

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:34.430
Sorry.

00:17:34.531 --> 00:17:36.467
- Don't you realize
what you've done?

00:17:36.569 --> 00:17:37.971
Nana threw a fit and
it's all because of you.

00:17:38.071 --> 00:17:40.677
She's really hard to deal
with when she's like that.

00:17:40.777 --> 00:17:41.946
- Oh, sorry.

00:17:42.046 --> 00:17:43.649
I just got really pissed off.

00:17:43.749 --> 00:17:44.751
It was pretty immature of me.

00:17:44.851 --> 00:17:48.960
- Well, Nana was the one
acting immature, but anyway.

00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:51.899
- Yeah. I'll apologize to her
when I see her at practice.

00:17:51.999 --> 00:17:53.703
- Where are you going
so late at night

00:17:53.803 --> 00:17:55.138
with a guitar in hand?

00:17:55.239 --> 00:17:56.876
Are you a Nagashi?

00:17:56.976 --> 00:17:57.911
Oh, cool.

00:17:58.011 --> 00:17:59.413
- What's Nagashi?

00:17:59.514 --> 00:18:01.585
- A musician who
wanders the earth,

00:18:01.685 --> 00:18:03.321
alone in search of love.

00:18:03.421 --> 00:18:04.457
- Oh.

00:18:05.225 --> 00:18:06.595
That's cool.

00:18:08.766 --> 00:18:09.333
Later guys.

00:18:09.433 --> 00:18:11.304
Let's play Majong
again sometime.

00:18:11.404 --> 00:18:12.674
Okay?

00:18:12.774 --> 00:18:14.611
- He's a cutie, isn't he?

00:18:14.711 --> 00:18:15.546
And he's got sex appeal.

00:18:15.647 --> 00:18:17.717
I bet you get horny
living with them.

00:18:17.817 --> 00:18:18.285
- Yeah as if.

00:18:18.385 --> 00:18:20.222
- Haven't you had
enough of women?

00:18:20.322 --> 00:18:21.291
- Not even close, man.

00:18:21.391 --> 00:18:23.696
I've got a whole
life ahead of me.

00:18:42.166 --> 00:18:43.502
- "Dear Nana.

00:18:43.603 --> 00:18:47.443
I'm sorry for being so
self-centered.

00:18:47.544 --> 00:18:50.449
I understand if you'll
never forgive me,

00:18:51.217 --> 00:18:52.486
but I will always

00:18:52.587 --> 00:18:57.296
always remember these last
six months living with you.

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:00.435
I feel so lonely knowing

00:19:00.536 --> 00:19:03.976
that I may not be able
to see you anymore,

00:19:04.076 --> 00:19:06.715
but I just don't
know what to do.

00:19:08.151 --> 00:19:11.357
That's why I hope you
guys make it big fast

00:19:11.457 --> 00:19:14.130
and get on TV a lot.

00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:16.702
Then I can watch you sing.

00:19:16.802 --> 00:19:20.042
It doesn't matter who
I'm in love with.

00:19:20.142 --> 00:19:24.450
You'll always be my only hero.

00:19:24.551 --> 00:19:28.893
Nana, there's no one in the
world who's as cool as you.

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:34.303
Now and forever."

00:19:39.948 --> 00:19:41.885
- What are you so upset about?

00:19:45.025 --> 00:19:46.795
This isn't a breakup letter.

00:19:46.895 --> 00:19:49.333
It's more like a
hot love letter.

00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:53.909
- "You'll always be
my only hero."

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:58.385
- You should go see
her at a new apartment.

00:19:58.485 --> 00:20:01.057
Don't you wanna see
how excited she'll be?

00:20:01.157 --> 00:20:02.092
(dog barking)

00:20:02.192 --> 00:20:04.497
- Dammit why should I
have to go and see her?

00:20:04.598 --> 00:20:06.535
It's not fair.

00:20:09.808 --> 00:20:13.248
- That's what heroes
do, don't you know?

00:20:14.651 --> 00:20:17.824
- A humble Nagashi,
at your service.

00:20:19.695 --> 00:20:20.797
You by yourself?

00:20:20.897 --> 00:20:22.166
Can I come in?

00:20:22.967 --> 00:20:24.203
- Sure.

00:20:28.713 --> 00:20:34.356
Shin, Mr. Nagashi, I'm
sorry about last time.

00:20:35.158 --> 00:20:36.795
- I will now serenade you.

00:20:46.214 --> 00:20:49.253
(guitar music)

00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:55.733
- "Hey Hachi.

00:20:55.833 --> 00:21:00.308
No matter how much or how
often people hurt each other

00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:04.618
loving someone is never a waste.

00:21:04.718 --> 00:21:07.489
That love letter you
left from me back then?

00:21:09.995 --> 00:21:11.865
I still cherish it."
