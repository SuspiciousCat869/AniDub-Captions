00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:04.075
(gentle music)

00:00:06.043 --> 00:00:08.348
- No matter how close I got to
them,

00:00:08.448 --> 00:00:10.686
no matter how often I went to
the studio

00:00:10.786 --> 00:00:12.757
to watch them practice,

00:00:12.857 --> 00:00:16.030
I was never going to be a member
of Blast.

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.871
More and more, I was forced
to realize that fact.

00:00:19.971 --> 00:00:23.444
I felt more terrified than
lonely.

00:00:23.545 --> 00:00:25.783
Am I really that weak?

00:02:04.514 --> 00:02:07.920
(door bell ringing)

00:02:08.822 --> 00:02:13.131
(door bell ringing repeatedly)

00:02:19.544 --> 00:02:22.950
(door bell ringing)

00:02:26.057 --> 00:02:28.127
(surprised gasp)

00:02:28.227 --> 00:02:30.432
- Shane? Did you forget your
keys again-

00:02:30.533 --> 00:02:32.069
- Ding dong.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.442
(birds chirping)

00:02:35.543 --> 00:02:36.878
(inquisitive music)

00:02:36.978 --> 00:02:38.649
- [Nobu] What are you doing?

00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:39.984
- So where are the ladies?

00:02:40.085 --> 00:02:40.653
- Ladies?

00:02:40.753 --> 00:02:43.191
- What's wrong, couldn't find
anyone to come home with you?

00:02:43.291 --> 00:02:45.328
- That is none of your business.

00:02:45.428 --> 00:02:47.900
- I brought over breakfast
for you, darling.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.138
- What the hell is going on?

00:02:52.476 --> 00:02:54.748
How could anyone eat all this
food?

00:02:54.848 --> 00:02:56.016
- And I have cake too.

00:02:56.117 --> 00:02:57.720
- What's up with you, anyway?

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:58.622
- [Nana] Here!

00:02:58.722 --> 00:03:00.125
- You brought a whole cake?

00:03:00.225 --> 00:03:01.293
Huh?

00:03:02.964 --> 00:03:05.636
(twinkling)

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.548
- It's all cold, so
I'll just nuke it, okay?

00:03:11.648 --> 00:03:13.719
- Nana, what is all this?

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:15.589
- You really still don't get it,
do you?

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:17.292
God, you're dense.

00:03:19.096 --> 00:03:20.398
(Nobuo sighing)

00:03:20.498 --> 00:03:21.233
(Nana gasps)

00:03:21.333 --> 00:03:23.004
Nobuo, wait! Where are you
going?

00:03:23.104 --> 00:03:25.275
- [Nobuo] To thank her.
No, to apologize.

00:03:25.375 --> 00:03:27.412
- But it's six in the morning.

00:03:27.513 --> 00:03:30.586
Hachiko is probably still
sleeping.

00:03:30.686 --> 00:03:32.824
(Nobuo sighs)

00:03:32.924 --> 00:03:33.725
- You're right.

00:03:33.826 --> 00:03:35.596
(Nana sighs)

00:03:35.696 --> 00:03:36.665
- She's got work this morning,

00:03:36.765 --> 00:03:39.436
so if you're gonna
apologize, do it tonight.

00:03:39.537 --> 00:03:42.375
And besides, you have to
work today too, right?

00:03:42.476 --> 00:03:43.612
- Mm-hmm.

00:03:43.712 --> 00:03:44.981
- Well then, let's eat.

00:03:45.081 --> 00:03:47.018
- It's Sunday, July 29th.

00:03:47.118 --> 00:03:48.856
It's gonna be a great day today.

00:03:48.956 --> 00:03:53.130
The Tokyo area, however,
will be windy this evening.

00:03:53.231 --> 00:03:54.199
Coming up after the break,

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.003
we'll have today's horoscope for
you-

00:03:56.103 --> 00:03:59.143
(TV clicks off)

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:06.423
- You know, there's something
I've been thinking about.

00:04:06.525 --> 00:04:07.560
- [Nana] Hmm?

00:04:08.862 --> 00:04:10.900
- Hachi really is an incredible
cook.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.304
- Really? She's all right.

00:04:21.086 --> 00:04:23.057
So I'm gonna leave the
leftovers here, okay?

00:04:23.157 --> 00:04:25.028
You can share 'em with Shin
and Yasu.

00:04:25.128 --> 00:04:27.065
I'll call Yasu
later and tell him to drop by

00:04:27.165 --> 00:04:28.836
when he's done work.

00:04:28.936 --> 00:04:30.171
- Yeah, but wouldn't it be nicer

00:04:30.271 --> 00:04:31.975
if we all saw Hachi tonight?

00:04:32.075 --> 00:04:34.213
We haven't said hi to
Misato, either.

00:04:34.313 --> 00:04:35.816
- Do whatever you want.

00:04:35.916 --> 00:04:36.585
I have to work tonight,

00:04:36.685 --> 00:04:39.289
so I'm gonna have my
piece of cake right now.

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:41.895
- Whoa! But that cake
is too precious to cut!

00:04:41.995 --> 00:04:43.799
At least take a picture first.

00:04:43.899 --> 00:04:44.901
- Already did.

00:04:45.001 --> 00:04:46.103
- [Nobuo] Give it!

00:04:46.203 --> 00:04:47.038
(makeup clattering)

00:04:47.138 --> 00:04:50.211
(Hachiko gasps)

00:04:59.463 --> 00:05:01.433
- [Hachiko] He didn't
hear the alarm going off

00:05:01.535 --> 00:05:03.605
or all the noise I just made.

00:05:05.643 --> 00:05:07.613
You must be exhausted.

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:15.061
But still, you let me come over.

00:05:15.161 --> 00:05:18.602
I'm glad, but I feel a bit
guilty.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.444
I thought I was just a
convenient girl

00:05:23.545 --> 00:05:26.685
that Takumi could sleep
with whenever he wanted.

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:30.759
But maybe it's not like that.

00:05:30.859 --> 00:05:33.932
Maybe I'm the one using
Takumi as someone convenient

00:05:34.032 --> 00:05:35.769
to hold me when I feel lonely.

00:05:38.074 --> 00:05:41.113
(gentle music)

00:05:50.431 --> 00:05:53.672
(lighter clicking)

00:05:53.772 --> 00:05:55.308
- I don't want it.

00:05:55.408 --> 00:05:58.715
(quiet footsteps)

00:06:01.554 --> 00:06:02.489
I don't want it!

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:04.459
Look, I told you I only came
here

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.531
because you gave me too much
last time.

00:06:06.631 --> 00:06:09.269
- Well then, you can make
it up to me by taking this

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:11.808
as an advance for the next
time you come to see me.

00:06:11.908 --> 00:06:15.281
(confused gasping)

00:06:21.795 --> 00:06:25.134
(strained sighing)

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:37.526
(soft whimpering)

00:06:39.429 --> 00:06:42.435
- Sorry, Take, I was out cold.
Am I late?

00:06:42.536 --> 00:06:43.872
- [Takeda] No, it's okay.

00:06:43.972 --> 00:06:44.741
I had a feeling you'd sleep in,

00:06:44.841 --> 00:06:47.112
so I accounted for that in the
schedule.

00:06:47.212 --> 00:06:49.216
I brought a change of clothes,
too.

00:06:49.316 --> 00:06:50.485
- Oh, thanks for doing that.

00:06:50.586 --> 00:06:51.821
- I'll leave them here, so get
ready.

00:06:51.921 --> 00:06:54.727
I'll go check Reira
outta her room first.

00:06:55.562 --> 00:06:56.196
- Huh?

00:06:56.296 --> 00:06:58.735
You mean Reira stayed here too?

00:06:58.835 --> 00:06:59.671
(car door opening)

00:06:59.771 --> 00:07:00.238
- [Reira] Huh?

00:07:00.338 --> 00:07:02.543
- I heard you're feeling
sick. Got a cold?

00:07:02.643 --> 00:07:05.849
- Oh, no. I was just a
little car sick.

00:07:05.949 --> 00:07:06.083
- What the hell?

00:07:06.183 --> 00:07:09.122
I don't remember you ever
getting car sick before.

00:07:09.222 --> 00:07:10.425
- You worried?

00:07:10.526 --> 00:07:11.561
- Of course I am.

00:07:11.661 --> 00:07:14.967
Because if you run outta gas,
then the band grinds to a halt

00:07:15.068 --> 00:07:16.638
and that sucks for everyone.

00:07:16.738 --> 00:07:17.339
- [Reira] Hmm.

00:07:17.439 --> 00:07:18.709
- So here, fill her up.

00:07:18.809 --> 00:07:19.409
(disgusted gasping)

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:21.781
- Don't talk to me like
I'm some kind of thing!

00:07:21.881 --> 00:07:24.419
- Take it easy, it was only
a metaphor.

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.490
I guess I'll just
drink it myself.

00:07:26.591 --> 00:07:27.392
- [Hachiko] My job that day

00:07:27.492 --> 00:07:29.831
was to sell milk at a
supermarket.

00:07:29.931 --> 00:07:32.068
It's a new, delicious milk
that comes straight...

00:07:32.168 --> 00:07:34.406
How long can I keep this up?

00:07:34.507 --> 00:07:38.882
Day after day, just doing time.

00:07:38.982 --> 00:07:42.389
(crickets chirping)

00:07:45.495 --> 00:07:46.263
Huh, where's the key?

00:07:46.363 --> 00:07:47.566
It's not here.

00:07:47.666 --> 00:07:49.771
Maybe Misato didn't go out.

00:07:50.672 --> 00:07:52.943
No way! For Mr. Mizukoshi?

00:07:53.044 --> 00:07:53.879
What is it?

00:07:53.979 --> 00:07:54.847
(wedding bells ringing)

00:07:54.947 --> 00:07:58.287
Okay. This I did
not need to know.

00:07:59.289 --> 00:08:02.696
That's so nice. I'm jealous.

00:08:02.797 --> 00:08:04.232
I wanna get married too.

00:08:04.332 --> 00:08:06.136
His wife's pretty.

00:08:06.236 --> 00:08:08.307
They've known each other
since they were kids.

00:08:08.407 --> 00:08:12.315
I wish I had a hot childhood
friend too.

00:08:12.415 --> 00:08:15.722
Doesn't matter if I don't
find a job that I like.

00:08:15.823 --> 00:08:20.064
If only I could spend every
day with someone I love.

00:08:20.164 --> 00:08:22.402
That would make me so happy.

00:08:24.406 --> 00:08:25.509
But Takumi's not the kind of guy

00:08:25.609 --> 00:08:27.847
who'd settle down and get
married.

00:08:27.947 --> 00:08:30.786
I gotta hurry up and put
an end to this relationship

00:08:30.886 --> 00:08:32.890
and start a real one.

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:35.529
But can a pathetic girl
like me find someone

00:08:35.629 --> 00:08:38.434
who will love me for the
rest of my life?

00:08:40.606 --> 00:08:43.344
What if things keep
going like this?

00:08:43.444 --> 00:08:45.281
What'll happen to me?

00:08:45.381 --> 00:08:48.020
Am I gonna grow old
and die alone?

00:08:49.289 --> 00:08:50.526
- Hachiko, welcome home!

00:08:50.626 --> 00:08:52.228
We were all waiting for you.

00:08:52.328 --> 00:08:55.636
We're having a party because
Blast just got a contract!

00:08:55.736 --> 00:08:58.107
- [Yasushi] Well, we
haven't signed it yet.

00:08:58.207 --> 00:09:01.013
- So what are waiting for
anyway?

00:09:01.113 --> 00:09:02.917
- Well, there are a few things-

00:09:03.017 --> 00:09:04.019
- Hachi!

00:09:05.087 --> 00:09:05.722
(Hachiko gasps)

00:09:05.823 --> 00:09:08.795
I'm so sorry, your cake
was amazing.

00:09:10.064 --> 00:09:15.509
- [Hachiko] Oh, Shin, make
me your wife.

00:09:15.609 --> 00:09:17.980
- Hey, Shin! Lay off, man!

00:09:19.282 --> 00:09:22.690
- [Hachiko] I can't play
the guitar or the keyboard.

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:25.762
I know I'll never be a member
of Blast.

00:09:25.863 --> 00:09:28.602
But the love I feel for
these guys and their music

00:09:28.702 --> 00:09:32.242
is something nobody else in the
world has.

00:09:32.342 --> 00:09:35.916
I swear, that'll be true
for the rest of my life.

00:09:41.794 --> 00:09:43.899
- So for a straight up
punk band like us,

00:09:43.999 --> 00:09:46.638
I think it might be better
to stick with the indie scene

00:09:46.738 --> 00:09:49.075
for a while and develop
a strong fan base there

00:09:49.176 --> 00:09:51.848
instead of signing on with
one of the major labels

00:09:51.948 --> 00:09:54.186
and hoping for a hit
on their terms.

00:09:54.286 --> 00:09:55.354
- But why?

00:09:55.454 --> 00:09:57.492
(Nobuo gasps)

00:09:57.593 --> 00:09:59.564
(both chuckle softly)

00:09:59.664 --> 00:10:02.503
- These days, bands who stay
indie can be almost as big

00:10:02.603 --> 00:10:03.638
as ones on major labels.

00:10:03.738 --> 00:10:06.243
But if you're gonna end up on
one of those labels anyway,

00:10:06.343 --> 00:10:06.978
why wait?

00:10:07.078 --> 00:10:09.482
Especially since one
already wants to sign you.

00:10:09.584 --> 00:10:11.721
- You really know your
stuff, don't cha, Misato?

00:10:11.821 --> 00:10:14.426
But as far as major labels
are concerned,

00:10:14.527 --> 00:10:15.929
our queen is anxious to make it.

00:10:16.029 --> 00:10:16.664
(whip cracking)

00:10:16.764 --> 00:10:18.535
So I was thinking if we're gonna
go big,

00:10:18.635 --> 00:10:20.238
we should do it right away.

00:10:20.338 --> 00:10:21.774
And if you really think about
it-

00:10:21.875 --> 00:10:23.545
- Come on, don't be
so cautious.

00:10:23.645 --> 00:10:25.616
I know you like taping the
ice to see if it's safe,

00:10:25.716 --> 00:10:29.222
but eventually it's gonna
crack and you'll fall through.

00:10:29.322 --> 00:10:30.424
- But the big record companies

00:10:30.525 --> 00:10:33.030
are all about the bottom
line: money.

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:34.065
Even if the first song's a hit,

00:10:34.165 --> 00:10:36.771
if the next one flops,
the label drops you.

00:10:36.871 --> 00:10:38.508
The stigma of being a
one-hit wonder

00:10:38.608 --> 00:10:40.846
makes a comeback very difficult.

00:10:40.946 --> 00:10:41.514
- Oh, I get it.

00:10:41.614 --> 00:10:42.550
So you think it's better
to build

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:45.054
a dedicated indie fan
base first,

00:10:45.154 --> 00:10:46.023
get big in that scene,

00:10:46.123 --> 00:10:48.127
and then go to a major label.

00:10:48.227 --> 00:10:49.296
- Absolutely.

00:10:49.396 --> 00:10:51.066
I just think that if
we sign a contract now,

00:10:51.166 --> 00:10:53.170
we'll have to take
whatever the record company

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:54.372
wants to give us.

00:10:54.472 --> 00:10:55.341
- Do you mean money?

00:10:55.441 --> 00:10:57.546
- Yeah, but not just that.

00:10:57.646 --> 00:11:00.117
I think if we wait and get
big in the indie scene,

00:11:00.217 --> 00:11:03.592
labels will offer us better
deals and we'll have more say.

00:11:03.692 --> 00:11:06.531
- But I don't care about
contracts and conditions!

00:11:06.631 --> 00:11:07.900
I just wanna be able to play.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.770
All we have to do is
make them money, right?

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:10.872
- That's right! That's right!

00:11:10.973 --> 00:11:12.943
- But honestly, do you
really think you can write

00:11:13.043 --> 00:11:15.983
a bunch of hit songs
one after another?

00:11:17.519 --> 00:11:18.287
(Nobu sighs)

00:11:18.387 --> 00:11:20.157
- Obviously! Of course he can do
it!

00:11:20.258 --> 00:11:21.861
He already has.

00:11:21.961 --> 00:11:24.567
I don't really know anything
about the music business,

00:11:24.667 --> 00:11:26.436
and I don't know
much about punk.

00:11:26.537 --> 00:11:28.541
The only reason I know
about the Sex Pistols

00:11:28.642 --> 00:11:30.879
is because I watch that
movie Sid and Nancy.

00:11:30.979 --> 00:11:34.553
To tell the truth, I don't
think I'll ever get into punk.

00:11:36.223 --> 00:11:37.726
- Are you serious?

00:11:39.195 --> 00:11:44.941
- I'm sorry. But I love
the songs Nobuo writes.

00:11:45.041 --> 00:11:45.509
(Nobuo inhales sharply)

00:11:45.609 --> 00:11:47.680
And I'm not just saying
this 'cause he's my friend.

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:50.652
I've loved his songs since
the first time I heard him.

00:11:50.752 --> 00:11:53.692
I was really surprised.
I got goosebumps!

00:11:53.792 --> 00:11:56.363
So there's no way you
guys won't make it big.

00:11:56.463 --> 00:11:58.200
- Ha-Hachi?

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:01.641
It's all right. I
understand, and I thank you.

00:12:01.741 --> 00:12:03.611
Just don't say another word.

00:12:03.712 --> 00:12:05.716
I'm so happy I could cry.

00:12:05.816 --> 00:12:08.722
(Hachiko stammering quietly)

00:12:08.822 --> 00:12:10.024
- I totally agree.

00:12:10.124 --> 00:12:12.930
Nobuo can write songs that'll
be hits for the major labels.

00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:14.165
- You think?

00:12:14.265 --> 00:12:15.502
- Well, when you think about it,

00:12:15.602 --> 00:12:17.472
it makes sense that it's
mostly indie fans

00:12:17.573 --> 00:12:19.442
who were into the
earlier Blast songs

00:12:19.543 --> 00:12:20.979
because Ren wrote most of them.

00:12:21.079 --> 00:12:23.685
But Nobuo's songs are
more pop than Ren's.

00:12:23.785 --> 00:12:24.954
Depending on how they're
produced,

00:12:25.054 --> 00:12:26.824
I think a wider audience
would be into them.

00:12:26.924 --> 00:12:28.795
- But obviously there are a lot
of people

00:12:28.895 --> 00:12:30.766
who like to listen to Ren's
songs.

00:12:30.866 --> 00:12:33.237
- [Misato] That's because he's
tailored them for Trapnest.

00:12:33.337 --> 00:12:35.742
He's writing for the masses.

00:12:35.842 --> 00:12:36.076
- Right.

00:12:36.176 --> 00:12:38.948
Misato, you have quite an
understanding of the music biz.

00:12:39.049 --> 00:12:39.650
I'm impressed.

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:41.353
- Well, I'm impressed with Ren.

00:12:41.453 --> 00:12:43.424
He can write songs to fit band's
image

00:12:43.525 --> 00:12:45.494
and turn them into big
hits as well!

00:12:45.595 --> 00:12:47.498
- Yeah, but don't forget
Trapnest songs

00:12:47.599 --> 00:12:49.503
also sell really well
because of all the work

00:12:49.603 --> 00:12:51.473
Takumi does on the arrangements.

00:12:51.574 --> 00:12:52.710
No matter what the song is,

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:55.615
once it's in his hands he can
make it into a Trapnest hit.

00:12:55.716 --> 00:12:56.149
(Nobuo gasps)

00:12:56.249 --> 00:12:58.287
- You know, that's something
I've always wondered about.

00:12:58.387 --> 00:12:59.824
I mean, how do you
think Ren feels

00:12:59.924 --> 00:13:02.963
about Takumi messing with
his songs all the time?

00:13:04.199 --> 00:13:05.101
- Yeah, totally.

00:13:05.201 --> 00:13:07.840
I mean don't most bands
arrange their songs together?

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:10.679
I would really hate it if I
was being told how to play.

00:13:10.779 --> 00:13:12.883
- Yeah, But Takumi has
started to get input

00:13:12.983 --> 00:13:14.052
from the other members as well.

00:13:14.152 --> 00:13:16.858
He seems to know all their
strengths and weaknesses,

00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.962
but in the old days he wrote
all the songs

00:13:19.062 --> 00:13:21.266
and the band was just
his one-man show.

00:13:21.366 --> 00:13:22.503
- That's why there were clashes!

00:13:22.603 --> 00:13:25.776
The band was like a revolving
door of musicians, wasn't it?

00:13:25.876 --> 00:13:28.581
If I remember right,
Naoki's their second drummer

00:13:28.681 --> 00:13:30.519
and Ren is the fourth guitarist.

00:13:30.619 --> 00:13:32.556
- [Yasushi] You really
know all the details.

00:13:32.656 --> 00:13:35.127
- Who'd want to be in a
band like that, right?

00:13:35.227 --> 00:13:35.494
- When Ren joined,

00:13:35.595 --> 00:13:38.500
did he know that this was
how things were gonna be?

00:13:38.601 --> 00:13:39.069
- Uh-huh.

00:13:39.169 --> 00:13:40.906
The truth is Ren has always
believed

00:13:41.006 --> 00:13:42.509
in Takumi's vision of
the band.

00:13:42.609 --> 00:13:44.880
- And what vision
is that?

00:13:45.414 --> 00:13:47.351
- Hmm.

00:13:47.452 --> 00:13:49.456
"The only one who can create the
music

00:13:49.557 --> 00:13:51.126
that sets the stage
for the power

00:13:51.226 --> 00:13:54.132
and beauty of Reira's
voice is me."

00:13:54.232 --> 00:13:55.602
- [Shin] Hmm?

00:13:55.702 --> 00:13:57.305
- Wow. Damn it all.

00:13:57.405 --> 00:13:59.142
That sounds pretty intense.

00:13:59.242 --> 00:14:00.010
- [Misato] I know.

00:14:00.111 --> 00:14:02.181
But Yasu, weren't you a
little bit jealous

00:14:02.281 --> 00:14:03.317
that he said that about her?

00:14:03.417 --> 00:14:05.087
She was your girlfriend.

00:14:05.187 --> 00:14:06.524
- How the hell do you
know about that?

00:14:06.624 --> 00:14:09.028
- When it comes to bands
from my hometown,

00:14:09.129 --> 00:14:11.834
I'll stop at nothing
to get all the details.

00:14:11.934 --> 00:14:12.970
I wanna know everything!

00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:14.239
It's what keeps me going.

00:14:14.339 --> 00:14:16.209
- Okay, but we broke up
a long time ago.

00:14:16.309 --> 00:14:17.278
- I know!

00:14:17.378 --> 00:14:18.380
(Yasu sighs)

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.117
- Wow. I didn't even know that.

00:14:20.217 --> 00:14:23.691
- [Hachiko] Jealous? Shouldn't
I be feeling jealous?

00:14:23.792 --> 00:14:26.296
There's obviously a
strong bond between them.

00:14:26.396 --> 00:14:29.603
Maybe they're are a
couple, knowing Takumi.

00:14:29.703 --> 00:14:31.741
I gotta stop thinking like this.

00:14:32.976 --> 00:14:34.947
- We're starting to get
off on a tangent here.

00:14:35.047 --> 00:14:37.084
We've got to figure out
what to do with our band

00:14:37.185 --> 00:14:39.122
instead of gossiping
about Trapnest.

00:14:39.222 --> 00:14:41.226
- [Misato] Yeah. You're right,
sorry.

00:14:41.326 --> 00:14:41.894
- Ah, come on.

00:14:41.994 --> 00:14:44.499
You always change the subject
whenever it turns to you.

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:46.704
- [Hachiko] What's wrong
with me? I should be jealous,

00:14:46.804 --> 00:14:48.908
but actually I think
they'd be a good couple.

00:14:49.008 --> 00:14:50.745
- [Shin] What's the point
of even discussing this

00:14:50.846 --> 00:14:52.583
when Nana's not here yet?

00:14:52.683 --> 00:14:53.785
- Oh my gosh, you're right!

00:14:53.885 --> 00:14:55.054
- So, when is Nana coming home?

00:14:55.154 --> 00:14:57.759
- Oh, she's working tonight,
so she might not make it home.

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:00.699
- [Hachiko] No way!
Nana isn't coming?

00:15:00.799 --> 00:15:02.569
But I haven't seen her for days.

00:15:02.669 --> 00:15:04.773
I mean, I did see her on stage
last night,

00:15:04.874 --> 00:15:07.211
but that's not the same thing,
really.

00:15:07.311 --> 00:15:07.846
(hollow thudding)

00:15:07.946 --> 00:15:11.687
- Hey Hachi, will you go buy
some wine? We're totally out.

00:15:11.787 --> 00:15:14.225
For your safety, Nobuo will
go with you.

00:15:14.325 --> 00:15:15.261
(Nobuo gasps)

00:15:15.361 --> 00:15:17.098
Go buy it yourself!

00:15:17.198 --> 00:15:19.570
- Unfortunately for me, I look
too young.

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:20.672
They won't sell me anything.

00:15:20.772 --> 00:15:23.477
- It's all right, Hachi.
I can get it myself.

00:15:23.578 --> 00:15:24.780
Please. Don't come.

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:26.717
- That's a bad idea
because Nobuo

00:15:26.817 --> 00:15:27.986
looks just as young as I do.

00:15:28.086 --> 00:15:31.326
But Hachi, you're so hot,
nobody would ever card you.

00:15:31.426 --> 00:15:32.361
- You think I'm hot?

00:15:32.461 --> 00:15:34.032
- [Shin] Just go.

00:15:38.508 --> 00:15:39.944
- [Hachiko] What should I do?

00:15:40.044 --> 00:15:43.450
What can we talk about
alone, just the two of us?

00:15:43.551 --> 00:15:46.591
(Hachiko whimpering)

00:15:46.691 --> 00:15:47.425
(Hachiko startles)

00:15:47.526 --> 00:15:51.366
- [Nobuo] Um, why are you
walking so far behind me?

00:15:51.466 --> 00:15:53.003
Just walk in front of me, okay?

00:15:53.103 --> 00:15:55.407
I'll worry if I can't see you.

00:15:56.544 --> 00:15:57.679
- [Hachiko] Okay.

00:15:57.779 --> 00:16:00.451
(footsteps)

00:16:11.039 --> 00:16:14.045
I can't walk in front of
you, it makes me nervous!

00:16:14.145 --> 00:16:15.314
- Oh, sorry.

00:16:15.414 --> 00:16:16.216
It's just, I-

00:16:16.316 --> 00:16:17.051
(Hachiko whimpering)

00:16:17.151 --> 00:16:19.155
- Can't we just walk side by
side?

00:16:19.255 --> 00:16:21.861
- Of course, if that's what
you want.

00:16:22.361 --> 00:16:25.034
(footsteps)

00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:30.411
(deep inhale)

00:16:30.512 --> 00:16:31.346
- Thank you!

00:16:31.446 --> 00:16:33.383
- Huh? What for?

00:16:33.483 --> 00:16:36.591
- Actually, I kind of
thought you might not ever

00:16:36.691 --> 00:16:38.728
want to talk to me again.

00:16:38.828 --> 00:16:41.767
So I'm glad you came tonight.

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:45.241
- What are you talking about?

00:16:45.341 --> 00:16:49.215
I mean, of course
I'll talk to you.

00:16:49.315 --> 00:16:49.917
- [Hachiko] I'm sorry.

00:16:50.017 --> 00:16:51.621
- [Nobuo] What are you
apologizing for?

00:16:51.721 --> 00:16:53.958
You didn't do anything wrong.

00:16:54.058 --> 00:16:54.994
- I did.

00:16:55.094 --> 00:17:00.839
And the truth is I really
am a horrible girl.

00:17:01.974 --> 00:17:03.343
(Nobuo laughing)

00:17:03.443 --> 00:17:05.347
- [Nobuo] What do you mean
horrible?

00:17:05.447 --> 00:17:06.584
Horrible how?

00:17:06.684 --> 00:17:07.586
- But I'm serious.

00:17:07.686 --> 00:17:09.523
Nobuo, stop always
idealizing me!

00:17:09.623 --> 00:17:13.531
If you saw who I really was,
you wouldn't even like me.

00:17:13.631 --> 00:17:17.004
- [Shin] You've got some
unrealistic ideas about women.

00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:23.116
- If you knew the real
me, you'd be disappointed.

00:17:23.216 --> 00:17:25.555
- [Shin] Hachi had just
broken up with her boyfriend.

00:17:25.655 --> 00:17:27.391
Maybe she was feeling lonely.

00:17:29.697 --> 00:17:33.003
(Hachiko sniffling)

00:17:33.103 --> 00:17:35.407
All right, then. Disappoint me.

00:17:35.508 --> 00:17:36.811
I'm ready.

00:17:38.113 --> 00:17:39.616
Otherwise, I don't know how else

00:17:39.717 --> 00:17:42.522
I'm gonna be able to
stop loving you.

00:17:42.622 --> 00:17:45.895
(uplifting music)

00:17:50.605 --> 00:17:54.012
(music intensifies)

00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:58.888
- [Shin] Hey, Yasu, tell
me more of that story.

00:17:58.988 --> 00:18:01.426
You know, for future reference.

00:18:01.527 --> 00:18:02.929
- What story is that?

00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:04.165
- You and Reira.

00:18:04.265 --> 00:18:07.839
Weren't you jealous of
Takumi and his vision?

00:18:08.975 --> 00:18:10.679
- Yeah, of course I was.

00:18:10.779 --> 00:18:11.479
Totally jealous.

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:12.883
- [Shin] Really? You were?

00:18:12.983 --> 00:18:15.622
- I was jealous of his
talent, his confidence,

00:18:15.722 --> 00:18:18.895
and his reckless personality.

00:18:18.995 --> 00:18:22.068
And on top of all that,
Reira was in love with him.

00:18:23.303 --> 00:18:25.307
Even before we started going
out,

00:18:25.407 --> 00:18:28.246
for some reason Reira was
attached to me.

00:18:28.347 --> 00:18:32.254
I was a year older, so I was
like a big brother to her.

00:18:32.355 --> 00:18:34.860
Takumi was a complete
womanizer back then,

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.064
but he never got with Reira.

00:18:38.634 --> 00:18:39.837
I mean, she was important to him

00:18:39.937 --> 00:18:42.241
but only because she
was his diva.

00:18:45.147 --> 00:18:47.418
- I just love to sing.

00:18:47.519 --> 00:18:52.094
I wish I was a singing machine
and then I'd feel nothing.

00:18:52.194 --> 00:18:55.000
No desire, no jealousy.

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:58.608
A high performance
machine that never breaks.

00:18:58.708 --> 00:19:02.114
But if I got rid of my feelings,

00:19:02.214 --> 00:19:04.252
it would be impossible to sing.

00:19:05.588 --> 00:19:07.324
It's hard to be human.

00:19:07.959 --> 00:19:08.795
- I empathized with her.

00:19:08.895 --> 00:19:11.801
So then I convinced her that
she should forget about him

00:19:11.901 --> 00:19:13.437
and go out with me instead.

00:19:13.538 --> 00:19:14.773
- You convinced her?

00:19:14.873 --> 00:19:16.276
- But once we started going out,

00:19:16.376 --> 00:19:18.714
it became more apparent
that there was no way

00:19:18.815 --> 00:19:20.685
I could win against Takumi.

00:19:20.785 --> 00:19:24.058
Now looking back, I know it
was nothing but petty jealousy.

00:19:24.158 --> 00:19:26.831
I didn't wanna listen to
Reira's complaining either.

00:19:26.931 --> 00:19:27.632
She was worried about the band

00:19:27.732 --> 00:19:31.172
and couldn't decide whether
or not to move to Tokyo.

00:19:31.272 --> 00:19:33.644
The thing is I wasn't
there for her to lean on

00:19:33.745 --> 00:19:34.947
when she needed me the most,

00:19:35.047 --> 00:19:38.053
so of course we broke up.

00:19:38.153 --> 00:19:41.392
- But Yasu, you could try
to be there for her now,

00:19:41.493 --> 00:19:42.461
couldn't you?

00:19:42.562 --> 00:19:43.363
- Nah, she's a big girl.

00:19:43.463 --> 00:19:45.568
I doubt she needs me around
anymore.

00:19:45.668 --> 00:19:48.106
And besides, right now
I have my hands full

00:19:48.206 --> 00:19:49.977
taking care of you guys.

00:19:53.584 --> 00:19:56.690
- [Hachiko] I have to
say goodbye to Takumi.

00:19:56.791 --> 00:19:57.959
If I can't do that,

00:19:58.059 --> 00:20:01.466
I have to tear myself
away from these arms.

00:20:01.567 --> 00:20:04.372
I can do it, right?

00:20:04.472 --> 00:20:07.044
I will say it and
I'll be all right.

00:20:07.144 --> 00:20:09.315
And this time I'll
really be happy

00:20:09.415 --> 00:20:13.423
because these arms hold the
entire future that I want.

00:20:13.524 --> 00:20:14.993
I can just feel it.

00:20:18.133 --> 00:20:19.235
- [Nana] Where's Hachiko?

00:20:19.335 --> 00:20:21.172
- [Misato] Oh, she went to get
some booze.

00:20:21.272 --> 00:20:23.076
- What the hell? I missed her
again?

00:20:23.176 --> 00:20:25.481
I even paid the cab driver
extra to speed.

00:20:25.582 --> 00:20:27.451
- [Yasushi] I'm sure
she'll be back anytime now.

00:20:27.552 --> 00:20:29.523
- [Shin] I think it might be
a while.

00:20:29.623 --> 00:20:30.558
- [Nana] Why is
that?

00:20:30.658 --> 00:20:33.063
- Because I sent her on an
errand with Nobuo.

00:20:33.163 --> 00:20:33.831
(hands slapping)

00:20:33.931 --> 00:20:34.800
- Really? Way to go, Shin!

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:37.873
Don't come back till dawn.
I'm counting on you, Nobuo!

00:20:37.973 --> 00:20:39.910
- What? I thought she had a
boyfriend?

00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:41.412
- I bet 10,000 yen they do it.

00:20:41.514 --> 00:20:43.283
- And I bet 10,000 yen they
don't.

00:20:43.383 --> 00:20:45.053
- I bet 100 he's done before he
starts!

00:20:45.154 --> 00:20:46.724
- You're so cheap.

00:20:46.824 --> 00:20:49.963
(romantic music)

00:20:57.779 --> 00:21:02.188
- [Hachiko] Hey Nana, the
feelings I professed that night

00:21:02.288 --> 00:21:04.693
remain unfaded in my heart.

00:21:06.296 --> 00:21:09.368
Those shining dreams
we had back then,

00:21:10.805 --> 00:21:13.076
don't ever forget them.
