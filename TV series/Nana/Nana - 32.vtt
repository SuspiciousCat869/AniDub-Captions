WEBVTT

00:00:01.336 --> 00:00:04.977
(somber piano music)

00:00:07.048 --> 00:00:09.987
- [Hachi] I'll still
call out for you, Nana.

00:00:10.087 --> 00:00:12.158
No matter how much it hurts,

00:00:12.926 --> 00:00:15.899
I'll call until you answer me.

00:00:20.107 --> 00:00:22.680
- [Nana] I'm sorry I
couldn't keep my promise.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.617
You probably don't remember,

00:00:24.717 --> 00:00:25.318
but I was really serious

00:00:25.418 --> 00:00:28.758
about building that gorgeous
house with a big yard.

00:00:28.858 --> 00:00:32.031
A house on a hill where
you could see the sea

00:00:33.835 --> 00:00:35.137
with a designer kitchen

00:00:35.237 --> 00:00:37.643
and a studio in the basement

00:00:37.743 --> 00:00:40.615
and piles of clothes in your
closet.

00:00:40.716 --> 00:00:43.187
All the latest fashions,
of course.

00:00:44.022 --> 00:00:45.826
I'd be there waiting.

00:00:45.926 --> 00:00:48.999
So, every time a boy
made you cry,

00:00:49.099 --> 00:00:50.836
you could come back home

00:00:51.571 --> 00:00:53.007
and just smile.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.384
(upbeat hard rock music)

00:02:33.708 --> 00:02:36.681
(wind whooshing)

00:02:43.026 --> 00:02:44.496
- One way to Tokyo, please.

00:02:44.597 --> 00:02:46.901
- The train is delayed
because of the snow.

00:02:47.001 --> 00:02:49.305
- Fine with me, as long
as I get there.

00:02:58.925 --> 00:03:00.194
Huh?

00:03:01.564 --> 00:03:04.670
(heartfelt music)

00:03:11.316 --> 00:03:13.287
You didn't have to
come see me off.

00:03:13.387 --> 00:03:14.422
- Heh.

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:19.032
I actually called in sick today,

00:03:19.132 --> 00:03:21.136
just so I could stake this place
out.

00:03:21.236 --> 00:03:23.173
And that's all you have to say.

00:03:24.108 --> 00:03:25.377
- You're alone?

00:03:25.478 --> 00:03:26.547
Where's Nobuo?

00:03:26.647 --> 00:03:29.385
- Probably at home
crying right now.

00:03:29.486 --> 00:03:31.824
After all, you just
told him yesterday.

00:03:31.924 --> 00:03:35.532
Think a little more about the
people you're leaving behind.

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:37.101
- Sorry.

00:03:37.201 --> 00:03:40.542
I didn't really know
how to tell you guys.

00:03:40.642 --> 00:03:43.046
- [Yasu] Well, I guess we
always knew

00:03:43.146 --> 00:03:45.217
this day would eventually come.

00:03:47.923 --> 00:03:48.925
- What's this?

00:03:49.025 --> 00:03:50.562
- This is my birthday
present to you.

00:03:50.662 --> 00:03:52.265
- This piece of paper?

00:03:53.835 --> 00:03:55.705
(Nana gasps)

00:03:55.805 --> 00:03:59.379
(heartfelt music)

00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:01.416
(grunts) You've got it all
wrong.

00:04:01.517 --> 00:04:04.690
I'm not going to Tokyo
'cause I wanna see him.

00:04:05.625 --> 00:04:06.193
- I know that

00:04:06.293 --> 00:04:09.032
but I thought you might
want to give him a call.

00:04:10.835 --> 00:04:13.173
- [Nana] You don't understand.

00:04:13.273 --> 00:04:15.612
You don't understand anything.

00:04:15.712 --> 00:04:18.217
- [Announcer] 310 to Tokyo,
the platform will be departing-

00:04:18.317 --> 00:04:22.693
- [Nana] If you understand me
at all, come with me, Yasu.

00:04:25.899 --> 00:04:28.437
Why can't I just ask you?

00:04:29.773 --> 00:04:32.011
You've already chosen
the life you want.

00:04:32.111 --> 00:04:33.447
That's why.

00:04:33.548 --> 00:04:36.286
And Nobuo has a great future
ahead of him.

00:04:39.192 --> 00:04:40.695
I can't ask you.

00:04:40.795 --> 00:04:44.168
You're gonna have to wish
for it, all on your own.

00:04:46.741 --> 00:04:47.743
- Nana.

00:04:49.178 --> 00:04:52.051
(ash sizzles)

00:04:52.151 --> 00:04:53.453
Don't go.

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:57.829
I'll be lonely without you.

00:05:04.042 --> 00:05:07.448
- Goddamn it. Then you
come with me.

00:05:07.549 --> 00:05:09.720
(bell ringing)

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.289
- Negotiations break off there.

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:12.693
Oh, well. Good luck, girl.

00:05:12.793 --> 00:05:16.266
- Yasu, there are plenty
of law firms in Tokyo too.

00:05:16.366 --> 00:05:19.439
- And you could just continue
singing in this town.

00:05:24.917 --> 00:05:28.591
(upbeat punk rock music)

00:05:31.697 --> 00:05:35.337
- [Nana] But there's no
Tokyo Dome or Budokan here.

00:05:35.437 --> 00:05:39.279
(upbeat punk rock music)

00:05:40.615 --> 00:05:44.022
You might think I'm crazy for
dreaming

00:05:44.122 --> 00:05:48.397
but one of these days, I'm
gonna sing on a big stage.

00:05:48.497 --> 00:05:49.667
All the spotlights will be on me

00:05:49.767 --> 00:05:51.804
and the audience will be
screaming.

00:05:51.904 --> 00:05:54.610
And I'll make more money than I
can burn.

00:05:56.179 --> 00:05:57.481
I'm not one of those princesses,

00:05:57.582 --> 00:05:59.586
who's just happy to sing.

00:06:00.922 --> 00:06:03.493
Singing is what keeps me alive.

00:06:04.495 --> 00:06:05.699
So I know that someday.

00:06:06.867 --> 00:06:08.938
(brakes grinding)

00:06:09.038 --> 00:06:10.608
Huh?

00:06:10.709 --> 00:06:11.276
What the?

00:06:11.376 --> 00:06:12.378
Who is this chick?

00:06:12.478 --> 00:06:15.451
And how long is she
gonna lie on top of me?

00:06:17.054 --> 00:06:18.958
You alright?

00:06:19.058 --> 00:06:19.927
- [Hachi] I'm totally fine.

00:06:20.027 --> 00:06:21.296
I'm so sorry.

00:06:22.365 --> 00:06:24.536
- [Nana] I'll never
forget that day.

00:06:24.636 --> 00:06:26.941
March 5th, 2001.

00:06:27.041 --> 00:06:29.045
My 20th birthday.

00:06:29.145 --> 00:06:31.316
That's the day I met you.

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:35.257
(rain falling)

00:06:35.357 --> 00:06:37.796
- Aw, I hate the Demon Lord.

00:06:37.896 --> 00:06:39.465
- Yeah, but you don't
have to cry about it.

00:06:39.566 --> 00:06:42.204
- But I totally wanted
to go see the fireworks.

00:06:42.304 --> 00:06:43.206
I even spent some of the money

00:06:43.306 --> 00:06:45.812
my mom gave me to
buy this yukata.

00:06:45.912 --> 00:06:50.154
- So, you finally dipped into
Natsuko's 300,000 yen? (sighs)

00:06:50.254 --> 00:06:51.857
(wind howling)

00:06:51.957 --> 00:06:54.328
We met on the train to Tokyo.

00:06:54.429 --> 00:06:56.332
Somehow she became my roommate,

00:06:56.433 --> 00:07:00.575
Nana Kamatsu, AKA
Hachi or Hachiko.

00:07:00.675 --> 00:07:04.516
She's selfish, way too
dependent and a cry baby.

00:07:04.616 --> 00:07:06.152
And she's completely boy crazy,

00:07:06.252 --> 00:07:08.858
jumping for whoever throws
her a bone.

00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:09.693
Six months in Tokyo

00:07:09.793 --> 00:07:12.833
and she was already on
her third boyfriend.

00:07:12.933 --> 00:07:13.467
- Nobuo.

00:07:13.568 --> 00:07:15.972
- [Nana] But she has an
innocent charm to her.

00:07:16.072 --> 00:07:18.678
She's definitely a weird one.

00:07:18.778 --> 00:07:19.680
(wind heavily whooshing)
(rain falling)

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:22.218
- Typhoon 11, which hit the
Tokyo area,

00:07:22.318 --> 00:07:25.224
is still increasing in
power as it heads north.

00:07:25.324 --> 00:07:25.692
It is expected-

00:07:25.792 --> 00:07:28.598
- You're that jealous of our
love, huh?

00:07:28.698 --> 00:07:30.334
I can understand why you feel
that way.

00:07:30.434 --> 00:07:33.039
- Are you talking to the Demon
Lord again?

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:34.810
It's starting to get
a little weird.

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:38.083
When it's Hachi, it's cute,
but you just look crazy.

00:07:38.183 --> 00:07:39.285
- Well, you're wrong.

00:07:39.385 --> 00:07:40.955
I'm talking to the weather lady.

00:07:41.055 --> 00:07:42.425
- That's even weirder.

00:07:42.526 --> 00:07:45.130
(phone rings and vibrates)

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:45.965
- Nana?

00:07:46.065 --> 00:07:47.268
- What the hell, Nobuo?

00:07:47.368 --> 00:07:48.370
Get over here.

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:50.508
You promised Hachi, you'd
pick her up at seven.

00:07:50.608 --> 00:07:52.779
- But I can't go out now in this
typhoon.

00:07:52.879 --> 00:07:55.585
The fireworks will be canceled
anyway.

00:07:55.685 --> 00:07:57.121
- Don't you wanna see Hachi?

00:07:57.221 --> 00:07:59.025
- She's got a new yukata.

00:07:59.125 --> 00:08:00.662
Your nose will bleed.

00:08:00.762 --> 00:08:01.362
(Nobuo gasps)

00:08:01.463 --> 00:08:03.133
(whimsical music)

00:08:03.233 --> 00:08:04.603
- Shin, why are you coming
anyway?

00:08:04.703 --> 00:08:07.174
- I wanna see Hachiko
in a kimono too.

00:08:07.274 --> 00:08:10.114
- [Nobuo] It's a yukata,
not a kimono, you moron.

00:08:10.214 --> 00:08:10.982
- [Shin] What's the difference?

00:08:11.082 --> 00:08:11.984
Ah.

00:08:12.084 --> 00:08:14.923
(bright music)

00:08:17.027 --> 00:08:18.598
- [Nobuo &amp; Shin] She's so cute.

00:08:18.698 --> 00:08:20.535
- We bought some fireworks.

00:08:20.635 --> 00:08:23.875
- After the storm, we can
light them down by the river.

00:08:23.975 --> 00:08:24.843
- Really?

00:08:24.943 --> 00:08:26.312
Thanks you guys.

00:08:27.448 --> 00:08:29.051
- [Nana] Hachi was our pet.

00:08:29.152 --> 00:08:30.822
Our band mascot.

00:08:30.922 --> 00:08:34.295
Well, a better term for
her would be our Madonna.

00:08:35.899 --> 00:08:38.838
Her smile alone lit up the
entire room.

00:08:38.938 --> 00:08:41.944
She always got us pumped in
the studio, at rehearsals,

00:08:42.044 --> 00:08:44.282
and especially at live shows.

00:08:45.518 --> 00:08:46.520
The energy she gave off

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:48.356
was more than anything
we could have gained

00:08:48.456 --> 00:08:50.628
by adding a new band member.

00:08:52.464 --> 00:08:56.841
(crickets chirping)
(water rushing)

00:08:56.941 --> 00:08:58.043
- That's a lot of water.

00:08:58.143 --> 00:08:59.580
Look at how high it's risen.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:01.917
- Yeah. We're lucky it didn't
flood over.

00:09:02.017 --> 00:09:02.586
(Hachi crying)

00:09:02.686 --> 00:09:04.322
- Fireworks aren't lighting.

00:09:04.422 --> 00:09:07.394
- Ah, damn it. They
got soaked in the rain.

00:09:08.296 --> 00:09:09.666
(Nobuo whimpers)
- You all right?

00:09:09.766 --> 00:09:11.002
- Yeah. You better not touch it.

00:09:11.102 --> 00:09:13.975
- Do we need to go
back to the store?

00:09:14.075 --> 00:09:15.645
- I got mine lit, Nana.

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:17.716
Here.

00:09:17.816 --> 00:09:18.518
- Thank you.

00:09:18.618 --> 00:09:20.354
- [Nobuo] Nice one, Yasu.

00:09:20.454 --> 00:09:22.258
- [Shin] Light mine.

00:09:22.358 --> 00:09:23.393
- You want one too, Misato?

00:09:23.493 --> 00:09:24.630
- Yes, please.

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:26.734
- [Shin] Hey, what about me?

00:09:26.834 --> 00:09:28.905
- [Hachi] Here Nobuo,
I'll lend you my fire.

00:09:29.005 --> 00:09:30.374
- [Nobuo] Thanks.

00:09:32.512 --> 00:09:34.215
- Oh man.

00:09:34.315 --> 00:09:35.484
- Here.

00:09:36.186 --> 00:09:37.756
(Hachi laughing)

00:09:37.856 --> 00:09:39.458
- [Nana] Is she really that
sweet

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.697
or is it all just a front?

00:09:41.797 --> 00:09:42.566
(Hachi laughing)

00:09:42.666 --> 00:09:46.339
(Hachi gasps)
(Nana gasps)

00:09:46.439 --> 00:09:49.378
(Hachi laughing)

00:09:49.478 --> 00:09:50.882
- [Hachi] Nana.

00:09:50.982 --> 00:09:54.890
(heartfelt music)

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:58.296
- [Nana] You probably
don't have a clue. Do you?

00:09:58.396 --> 00:10:00.635
Everything you do blows me away.

00:10:00.735 --> 00:10:02.639
Just like that typhoon.

00:10:04.442 --> 00:10:05.712
I feel like

00:10:06.412 --> 00:10:06.914
a teenage boy,

00:10:07.014 --> 00:10:09.519
falling in love for
the first time.

00:10:11.757 --> 00:10:13.761
I can't fight this anymore.

00:10:17.067 --> 00:10:18.436
I think I'm gonna burst.

00:10:18.537 --> 00:10:21.844
(heartfelt music)

00:10:24.148 --> 00:10:26.486
- You want to do it with
Hachiko?

00:10:26.587 --> 00:10:27.589
- I knew you wouldn't get it.

00:10:27.689 --> 00:10:28.390
You're so perverted.

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:30.828
All you ever think about is
having sex.

00:10:30.929 --> 00:10:32.899
- But isn't that because
a young man in love

00:10:32.999 --> 00:10:35.337
is always battling his sexual
desire?

00:10:35.437 --> 00:10:37.141
- It's got nothing to do with
sex,

00:10:37.241 --> 00:10:38.443
but it's definitely a battle.

00:10:38.544 --> 00:10:39.980
- What is it then? Hunger?

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.986
She does look delicious
like a mochi rice cake.

00:10:43.086 --> 00:10:44.388
- Mochi?

00:10:47.529 --> 00:10:48.463
Whenever I talk to you,

00:10:48.564 --> 00:10:51.670
the things I worry about
end up seeming so trivial.

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:54.241
- (laughs) Well, that's good to
hear.

00:10:54.342 --> 00:10:55.878
You take things
too seriously.

00:10:55.979 --> 00:10:58.618
There's always a black cloud
hanging over your head.

00:10:58.718 --> 00:11:00.788
Hachi's obviously attached to
you.

00:11:00.888 --> 00:11:03.961
You should be happy that
someone cares for you so much.

00:11:04.061 --> 00:11:07.434
It's okay to be as affectionate
with her as you want to be.

00:11:07.535 --> 00:11:09.806
There isn't anything wrong with
that.

00:11:10.508 --> 00:11:12.177
- You're right.

00:11:12.278 --> 00:11:13.581
- Edamame.

00:11:13.681 --> 00:11:16.352
- There I go again, agreeing
with him.

00:11:16.452 --> 00:11:17.756
What the hell is wrong with me?

00:11:17.856 --> 00:11:19.526
Why am I so completely
influenced

00:11:19.626 --> 00:11:22.097
by what Ren says or does?

00:11:22.197 --> 00:11:24.536
Before, it was because I
had such a crush on him.

00:11:24.636 --> 00:11:26.507
But why is it still like that?

00:11:26.607 --> 00:11:28.811
I haven't changed at all.

00:11:28.911 --> 00:11:31.583
I wasn't even gonna get
back together with him,

00:11:31.684 --> 00:11:32.384
but before I knew it,

00:11:32.484 --> 00:11:35.290
I became his little wifey all
over again.

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:35.825
- Huh?

00:11:35.925 --> 00:11:38.664
- What am I doing,
making this stupid soup?

00:11:38.764 --> 00:11:40.467
And in the middle of
the night too?

00:11:40.568 --> 00:11:42.171
- Because it's my favorite.

00:11:42.271 --> 00:11:43.306
- Fine, but-

00:11:43.406 --> 00:11:46.446
(pan rattling)

00:11:48.985 --> 00:11:51.924
(water bubbling)

00:11:58.938 --> 00:12:01.777
(fire burning)

00:12:04.148 --> 00:12:04.783
(sensual music)

00:12:04.883 --> 00:12:08.456
- So, now how do I
control your heat?

00:12:08.557 --> 00:12:09.926
- [Nana] You can't.

00:12:15.738 --> 00:12:17.374
If there is a way,

00:12:17.474 --> 00:12:18.878
show me how.

00:12:19.445 --> 00:12:21.149
Somebody

00:12:21.249 --> 00:12:22.619
please help me.

00:12:23.453 --> 00:12:26.492
(sensual music)

00:12:27.494 --> 00:12:29.833
Why does this happen to me?

00:12:29.933 --> 00:12:33.073
Why does my heart burn so hot?

00:12:38.416 --> 00:12:41.924
(traffic rumbling)

00:12:42.024 --> 00:12:44.863
(phone ringing)

00:12:48.403 --> 00:12:49.438
- [Ren] Hello?

00:12:49.539 --> 00:12:51.844
Oh, Take, morning.

00:12:54.415 --> 00:12:56.553
No, I'm cool. I'll take my car.

00:12:58.591 --> 00:13:00.828
(yawns) I'll be out the door in
30.

00:13:02.398 --> 00:13:03.834
- [Nana] He hardly slept at all.

00:13:03.934 --> 00:13:06.807
He's gonna wear himself out.

00:13:06.907 --> 00:13:09.846
But I am kind of jealous,
he has so much work.

00:13:09.946 --> 00:13:12.017
In fact, it's frustrating.

00:13:14.155 --> 00:13:15.958
- You could have stayed in bed
longer.

00:13:16.058 --> 00:13:17.929
I'm telling you, if
you try living like me,

00:13:18.029 --> 00:13:19.666
you're gonna end up dying young.

00:13:19.766 --> 00:13:21.670
- But I have to go to work.

00:13:24.041 --> 00:13:26.613
And the moving company Nobuo
works for needs people.

00:13:26.713 --> 00:13:28.651
So, now I'm doing that.

00:13:28.751 --> 00:13:30.153
- A moving company?

00:13:30.253 --> 00:13:31.857
How macho of you.

00:13:33.193 --> 00:13:34.596
- [Nana] We have band
practice every night,

00:13:34.696 --> 00:13:36.432
which means I can't work nights
anymore.

00:13:36.533 --> 00:13:38.838
So now I've got a day job.

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:41.977
- [Ren] What's up with your
album release?

00:13:42.077 --> 00:13:43.446
Any progress?

00:13:43.547 --> 00:13:45.217
- No, not yet.

00:13:49.091 --> 00:13:50.193
In those days,

00:13:50.293 --> 00:13:53.399
I spent about half my
time at Ren's apartment.

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.003
But because of our schedules,

00:13:55.103 --> 00:13:57.542
we really didn't see each other
much.

00:13:57.642 --> 00:14:01.149
(car engine revving)

00:14:01.249 --> 00:14:04.723
And the times we were together,
we just wanted to do it.

00:14:04.823 --> 00:14:06.058
So there wasn't a lot of time

00:14:06.159 --> 00:14:08.998
to talk about what was
going on with us.

00:14:12.237 --> 00:14:15.443
But I thought that was
for the best.

00:14:15.545 --> 00:14:16.647
That way we could avoid talking

00:14:16.747 --> 00:14:19.251
about things that made
us uncomfortable.

00:14:21.523 --> 00:14:25.030
(car engine rumbling)

00:14:25.765 --> 00:14:29.038
(camera clicking)

00:14:37.221 --> 00:14:38.524
- What? Still there?

00:14:38.624 --> 00:14:40.427
So annoying, aren't they?

00:14:40.528 --> 00:14:42.331
- Maybe I should move out.

00:14:42.431 --> 00:14:43.567
But what's the point?

00:14:43.667 --> 00:14:45.170
- Because of Papa-rakkyos

00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:46.005
- Razzi, idiots.

00:14:46.105 --> 00:14:46.773
But what I'm talking about,

00:14:46.874 --> 00:14:48.409
is the woman Ren's
sleeping with.

00:14:48.511 --> 00:14:49.846
I told you to send her home.

00:14:49.946 --> 00:14:52.886
- Aren't rakkyo those pickled
onions serve with curry?

00:14:52.986 --> 00:14:53.587
- Yeah.

00:14:53.687 --> 00:14:56.092
But you gotta have fukujinzuke
with curry.

00:14:56.192 --> 00:14:56.693
- What?

00:14:56.793 --> 00:14:58.764
A curry wouldn't be a
curry without a raw egg.

00:14:58.864 --> 00:14:59.699
Right, Takumi?

00:14:59.799 --> 00:15:03.173
- You idiot. I don't eat
that poor man's curry.

00:15:03.273 --> 00:15:05.076
- Open the curry pouch like
this,

00:15:05.177 --> 00:15:06.513
then heat it directly in the
pot.

00:15:06.613 --> 00:15:09.953
And when it runs low, add
new pouches one at a time.

00:15:10.053 --> 00:15:13.393
Be careful not to let the curry
burn and stick to the pot.

00:15:15.965 --> 00:15:17.802
The rice has already been
cooked.

00:15:17.902 --> 00:15:20.975
All you need to do is put
a little on each plant.

00:15:22.712 --> 00:15:23.614
(Hachi groaning)

00:15:23.714 --> 00:15:24.950
Miss Kamatsu.

00:15:25.651 --> 00:15:28.791
(Hachi groaning)

00:15:30.561 --> 00:15:31.930
- [Hachi] I'm so sorry.

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:33.132
- It can't be helped.

00:15:33.233 --> 00:15:35.203
You're not feeling very well.
That's all.

00:15:35.303 --> 00:15:37.976
Thank goodness, there
were no customers around.

00:15:38.076 --> 00:15:39.178
- [Hachi] I really am sorry.

00:15:39.278 --> 00:15:41.750
- It could have something to
do with this summer heat wave.

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:44.255
You should probably
go see a doctor.

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:48.162
- Yeah.

00:15:50.568 --> 00:15:53.974
(suspenseful music)

00:16:34.188 --> 00:16:39.899
(wind whooshing)
(suspenseful music continues)

00:16:49.018 --> 00:16:50.921
- Look who's eating curry.

00:16:51.022 --> 00:16:53.359
And at the company cafeteria.

00:16:54.829 --> 00:16:56.098
- Uh.

00:16:56.198 --> 00:16:58.403
I don't usually eat this kind of
stuff

00:16:58.504 --> 00:16:59.973
but for some stupid reason,

00:17:00.073 --> 00:17:02.578
I suddenly had a craving for it.

00:17:02.679 --> 00:17:04.749
- It's because no matter
what you say,

00:17:04.849 --> 00:17:06.352
you like it.
- Uh.

00:17:10.628 --> 00:17:11.897
Mm.

00:17:20.815 --> 00:17:25.023
(sighs) I can't wait till it's
over.

00:17:25.123 --> 00:17:26.125
- What?

00:17:27.027 --> 00:17:28.797
- Summer vacation.

00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:34.008
- (sighs) Only three more days.

00:17:34.108 --> 00:17:37.582
Summer vacation may be long,
but it's over way too soon.

00:17:37.682 --> 00:17:38.784
I just wish I knew for sure

00:17:38.884 --> 00:17:40.988
that your album release was all
settled.

00:17:41.088 --> 00:17:43.560
Then at least I could go
home a little psyched.

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:47.000
But it's been a month already
since you signed the contract

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:49.004
and nothing's been worked out
yet.

00:17:49.104 --> 00:17:52.679
- [Shin] Yeah, but it's
just a temporary contract.

00:17:52.779 --> 00:17:53.847
- I guess I don't understand

00:17:53.947 --> 00:17:56.218
exactly what a temporary
contract is.

00:17:56.318 --> 00:17:58.924
How is it different from
a real contract?

00:17:59.024 --> 00:18:02.064
- [Shin] It's kind of like,
we're engaged to Gaia.

00:18:02.164 --> 00:18:02.765
- Huh?

00:18:02.865 --> 00:18:05.638
- [Shin] Mr. Kawano has been
busy trying to get the money

00:18:05.738 --> 00:18:07.107
and the wedding party lined up.

00:18:07.207 --> 00:18:08.877
So then we can have a
big reception,

00:18:08.977 --> 00:18:10.213
where we'll all get drunk.

00:18:10.313 --> 00:18:11.348
- Huh?

00:18:12.618 --> 00:18:13.987
- This contract means,

00:18:14.088 --> 00:18:15.825
don't screw around with
anyone else,

00:18:15.925 --> 00:18:17.829
even if they approach
you with a better offer

00:18:17.929 --> 00:18:19.899
and in return for
staying faithful,

00:18:19.999 --> 00:18:22.304
we get to use the Gaia
studios as much as we want,

00:18:22.404 --> 00:18:25.578
while we prepare to be
beautiful blushing brides.

00:18:25.678 --> 00:18:26.379
- Now I get it.

00:18:26.479 --> 00:18:29.251
I finally understand
the whole process.

00:18:29.351 --> 00:18:31.255
Thank you, Shin.

00:18:31.355 --> 00:18:32.892
- Misato, you're older than me.

00:18:32.992 --> 00:18:35.631
So, why do you still
speak so politely to me?

00:18:37.535 --> 00:18:39.739
- Well, that's just it,
you're younger than me.

00:18:39.839 --> 00:18:43.881
So how is it that you're able
to help me with my homework?

00:18:43.981 --> 00:18:45.684
- I can only help you
with your English.

00:18:45.785 --> 00:18:48.624
You'll have to ask Yasu
to help you with the rest.

00:18:48.724 --> 00:18:50.260
- I knew it.

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:50.661
- Knew what?

00:18:50.761 --> 00:18:54.067
- Your fair complexion is 'cause
you're only half Japanese.

00:18:54.168 --> 00:18:55.571
- My fair complexion?

00:18:55.671 --> 00:18:58.076
- [Misato] Hide it all
you want but I can tell.

00:18:58.176 --> 00:19:01.082
That's why your English is so
good. Right?

00:19:01.182 --> 00:19:04.622
- I understand English
because I grew up overseas.

00:19:04.722 --> 00:19:06.560
Both of my parents are Japanese.

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:07.160
- What?

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:08.496
You grew up overseas? Where?

00:19:08.597 --> 00:19:12.037
You're telling me that
you're 100% Japanese?

00:19:12.137 --> 00:19:13.740
- Don't you believe me?

00:19:13.841 --> 00:19:15.611
- No, Shin, I don't.

00:19:19.418 --> 00:19:21.355
- (sighs) I don't either.

00:19:23.961 --> 00:19:26.065
I wish I'd never been born.

00:19:27.802 --> 00:19:29.004
- Huh?

00:19:33.112 --> 00:19:35.718
(traffic rumbling)

00:19:35.818 --> 00:19:39.191
(crowd chattering)

00:19:47.007 --> 00:19:50.146
(water dripping)

00:20:00.233 --> 00:20:04.408
(water dripping intensifies)

00:20:07.013 --> 00:20:09.719
(Hachi gasps)

00:20:09.819 --> 00:20:11.021
(truck beeping)

00:20:11.121 --> 00:20:12.357
- [Delivery Man] Little further.

00:20:12.457 --> 00:20:13.627
Little further.

00:20:13.727 --> 00:20:14.495
Okay.

00:20:14.596 --> 00:20:15.631
Stop.

00:20:17.702 --> 00:20:18.469
- Oh.

00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:20.173
This mansion is huge.

00:20:21.977 --> 00:20:22.778
(Nobuo grunts)

00:20:22.879 --> 00:20:24.983
- Ha, no way, it's tiny.

00:20:25.083 --> 00:20:26.653
Just wait till you see the big
mansion

00:20:26.753 --> 00:20:28.857
Nana from Blast is gonna be
living in.

00:20:28.957 --> 00:20:30.426
Watch your back, Demon Lord.

00:20:30.528 --> 00:20:33.667
- Oh, so I see that
you're a believer as well.

00:20:33.767 --> 00:20:35.103
- You've got it all wrong.

00:20:35.203 --> 00:20:37.542
I'm the Demon Lord's master.

00:20:37.642 --> 00:20:39.311
Hmm.

00:20:39.411 --> 00:20:42.952
Back then I was pursuing my
dreams.

00:20:43.052 --> 00:20:45.624
I achieved a lot of my goals.

00:20:45.724 --> 00:20:50.734
But along the way, I lost
something irreplaceable.

00:20:50.834 --> 00:20:53.039
I lived fast and furious.

00:20:53.139 --> 00:20:54.809
Never looking back,

00:20:54.909 --> 00:20:56.913
with no regrets at all.

00:20:57.013 --> 00:21:00.119
Now there's only one
thing I regret.

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:03.527
Hey, Hachi,

00:21:03.627 --> 00:21:04.729
I wonder,

00:21:05.363 --> 00:21:07.067
are you happy now?

00:21:07.835 --> 00:21:10.808
(somber guitar music)

00:21:10.908 --> 00:21:13.680
(water drops)
