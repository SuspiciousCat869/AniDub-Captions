WEBVTT

00:00:01.937 --> 00:00:04.041
(birds chirping)

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:06.747
- [Nana O] Those strawberry
glasses were still

00:00:06.848 --> 00:00:09.285
on sale at the hundred yen
store.

00:00:10.254 --> 00:00:12.458
But when I thought about Hachi,

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:15.932
who took such special
care of the two we had,

00:00:16.032 --> 00:00:20.374
the cut on my left cheek that
I don't remember getting,

00:00:20.474 --> 00:00:21.076
(glass crashing)

00:00:21.176 --> 00:00:23.515
started to hurt like hell.

00:00:23.615 --> 00:00:27.021
(upbeat rock music)

00:02:02.044 --> 00:02:04.015
(cash register beeping)

00:02:04.115 --> 00:02:06.252
- [Cashier] That'll be 105 yen.

00:02:07.254 --> 00:02:08.357
- [Nana O] I'll go back home
tonight

00:02:08.457 --> 00:02:10.528
and tell Hachi that I'm sorry.

00:02:12.733 --> 00:02:15.505
- [Cashier] Thank you, have a
good day.

00:02:15.605 --> 00:02:18.711
- [Nana O] The glass fell
and smashed to pieces.

00:02:18.811 --> 00:02:19.479
I can't really remember,

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.753
but I'm pretty sure that's what
happened.

00:02:22.853 --> 00:02:26.894
How the hell did I end
up at Ren's place, anyway?

00:02:26.994 --> 00:02:28.330
I was trying to stay away from
there

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.269
so we could avoid any
kind of scandal.

00:02:33.106 --> 00:02:34.175
Oh, well.

00:02:34.275 --> 00:02:36.781
Good thing I didn't
wake up at Yasu's.

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.624
I've gotta stop being
so dependent on Yasu.

00:02:41.724 --> 00:02:43.561
He isn't my boyfriend.

00:02:47.736 --> 00:02:50.542
(Reira crying)

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:17.929
- Reira.

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.298
I'm really sorry,

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:22.171
but I'm gonna have to
get back to work soon.

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.677
(gasps softly)

00:03:24.777 --> 00:03:26.312
- Sorry.

00:03:26.413 --> 00:03:27.849
- I'll come back
as soon as I can.

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:30.555
Will you stay here
until I get back?

00:03:35.397 --> 00:03:36.701
- Uh huh.

00:03:43.046 --> 00:03:44.583
- I'll lock the door behind me.

00:03:44.683 --> 00:03:47.421
Don't open it for anyone else.

00:03:47.522 --> 00:03:48.524
- Okay.

00:03:54.102 --> 00:03:55.204
(lock clicks)

00:03:55.304 --> 00:03:58.678
(soft music)

00:04:03.186 --> 00:04:07.963
- [Reira] I'm so sorry, Yasu,
for calling you like this.

00:04:08.063 --> 00:04:11.302
I couldn't think of anyone
else I could talk to.

00:04:13.674 --> 00:04:16.647
Takumi told us he's getting
married.

00:04:16.747 --> 00:04:19.553
He said it like it was
no big deal.

00:04:19.653 --> 00:04:22.491
And I just ran away
from the studio.

00:04:22.592 --> 00:04:24.863
I didn't feel like
singing anymore.

00:04:26.734 --> 00:04:30.708
But I didn't know what
to do or where to go.

00:04:30.809 --> 00:04:35.585
I feel like wherever I go,
everyone's watching me.

00:04:37.121 --> 00:04:38.925
I'm scared.

00:04:39.025 --> 00:04:41.564
If people knew that I just
ran out of a recording,

00:04:41.664 --> 00:04:43.968
they'd be so disappointed in me.

00:04:46.072 --> 00:04:48.243
The staff, the fans.

00:04:48.343 --> 00:04:51.282
They'd ditch me, saying
I'm finished.

00:04:52.752 --> 00:04:56.392
But the thing is,
I just can't sing.

00:04:58.798 --> 00:04:59.833
What can I do?

00:05:01.302 --> 00:05:04.275
If I can't sing, I'm worthless!

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.844
(Reira sniffs)

00:05:21.944 --> 00:05:24.415
- I just heard back from Mr.
Takeda.

00:05:24.516 --> 00:05:27.154
She didn't go back to
the hotel either.

00:05:27.254 --> 00:05:28.490
- Hmm.

00:05:29.492 --> 00:05:31.262
- Well, did she take her
stuff with her?

00:05:31.362 --> 00:05:32.364
Did you try calling her cell?

00:05:32.464 --> 00:05:34.468
- Yes, several times,
but she won't answer.

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:36.841
- It's so bizarre she'd
run off like that.

00:05:36.941 --> 00:05:39.345
She was all amped to
record when she came in.

00:05:39.445 --> 00:05:42.017
- Does anyone have any
idea where else Reira

00:05:42.117 --> 00:05:43.386
might have run off to?

00:05:43.487 --> 00:05:45.959
Sorry to ask, but I've
only been here a few days

00:05:46.059 --> 00:05:49.666
and I haven't really seen who
she likes to hang out with.

00:05:49.766 --> 00:05:50.902
- Maybe she has a secret lover!

00:05:51.002 --> 00:05:53.106
- Come to think of it,
what close friends

00:05:53.206 --> 00:05:54.475
does she have anyway?

00:05:54.576 --> 00:05:55.979
- No idea, don't ask me.

00:05:56.079 --> 00:05:57.849
- But isn't it true
that you and Reira

00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:00.955
have known each other
since you were kids?

00:06:01.055 --> 00:06:02.959
- Yeah, what's your point?

00:06:03.895 --> 00:06:04.997
- Nothing.

00:06:05.798 --> 00:06:06.901
- So what do we do, Takumi?

00:06:07.001 --> 00:06:08.871
Should we go ahead and record
without her?

00:06:08.971 --> 00:06:10.875
- How can we be expected to
concentrate

00:06:10.975 --> 00:06:13.213
when everyone around
here's freaking out?

00:06:13.313 --> 00:06:14.816
There's just no way.

00:06:14.917 --> 00:06:15.518
- Ah, man.

00:06:15.618 --> 00:06:16.987
- Sorry about that.

00:06:20.929 --> 00:06:21.897
It's all right, Mari.

00:06:21.997 --> 00:06:24.836
Your job here is to
take care of Reira.

00:06:24.937 --> 00:06:29.078
So just worry about her and
nevermind everything else, okay?

00:06:29.178 --> 00:06:30.882
- Okay.

00:06:30.982 --> 00:06:34.690
- So now go find her and drag
her back.

00:06:37.428 --> 00:06:40.367
(door thuds)

00:06:42.505 --> 00:06:44.877
- [Mari] I'm sorry.

00:06:44.977 --> 00:06:46.346
- Don't cry, Mari.

00:06:46.446 --> 00:06:47.414
He's scary, huh?

00:06:47.515 --> 00:06:49.051
He scares me too.

00:07:00.875 --> 00:07:03.146
- So boozing it up on the job,
huh?

00:07:03.246 --> 00:07:04.716
- It's water.

00:07:07.254 --> 00:07:09.660
- If the band is as important
to you, as you say it is,

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:10.695
then why'd you say something

00:07:10.795 --> 00:07:14.101
that would upset our princess
right before recording?

00:07:15.638 --> 00:07:17.909
Kind of a brutal way to get her
fired up.

00:07:18.009 --> 00:07:20.915
- Whatever that's
supposed to mean.

00:07:21.015 --> 00:07:22.318
- Don't act so stupid.

00:07:22.418 --> 00:07:24.790
You know, Reira's
in love with you.

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:26.059
- Dammit, why'd you say that?

00:07:26.159 --> 00:07:27.461
You know how hard
it's been for me

00:07:27.562 --> 00:07:29.700
to pretend I don't know
that?

00:07:31.402 --> 00:07:34.475
- Ignoring it will just
make things worse.

00:07:34.576 --> 00:07:35.945
You know, once you get married,

00:07:36.045 --> 00:07:38.283
Reira might not wanna
sing anymore.

00:07:38.383 --> 00:07:41.055
- If me getting married means
she's gonna stop singing

00:07:41.155 --> 00:07:42.659
then we have big problems.

00:07:42.759 --> 00:07:46.299
It's just that I'm not in
love with her or anything.

00:07:46.399 --> 00:07:48.136
I can't help how I feel.

00:07:50.374 --> 00:07:53.547
- Then I guess there's really
nothing you can do about it.

00:07:53.648 --> 00:07:56.553
But if Reira won't sing,
Trapnest is finished.

00:07:56.654 --> 00:07:57.889
- You think I don't know that?

00:07:57.989 --> 00:08:00.962
Just what the hell do
you suggest I do?

00:08:01.062 --> 00:08:03.199
- If the emperor showed
a little more love,

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:05.470
the princess might wanna sing.

00:08:06.874 --> 00:08:08.978
- You telling me to do it
with Reira?

00:08:09.078 --> 00:08:09.646
Geez, man.

00:08:09.746 --> 00:08:13.019
She's like a little sister to
me, so you can just forget it.

00:08:13.119 --> 00:08:15.357
- But you're not a
blood relative.

00:08:15.457 --> 00:08:17.361
- That isn't the point.

00:08:17.461 --> 00:08:19.065
- Look, for as long
as I've known you,

00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:21.002
you've never let anything get
in the way

00:08:21.102 --> 00:08:23.741
of what it is that you
want, have you?

00:08:23.841 --> 00:08:25.611
Compared to marrying the
girl next door,

00:08:25.712 --> 00:08:28.016
who's only after your wallet,
your empire could grow

00:08:28.116 --> 00:08:31.289
with a marriage of
convenience to Reira.

00:08:31.389 --> 00:08:33.159
- Empire?
- It fits.

00:08:33.259 --> 00:08:35.397
- I never thought you
could come up with a plan

00:08:35.497 --> 00:08:37.167
that ambitious.

00:08:37.267 --> 00:08:39.539
- This isn't about what I want.

00:08:39.639 --> 00:08:42.645
I'm merely suggesting a
strategy that a megalomaniac

00:08:42.746 --> 00:08:44.516
like you might be interested in.

00:08:44.616 --> 00:08:47.589
- Hey, don't get all
high and mighty on me.

00:08:47.689 --> 00:08:49.760
Let's not forget that you
ditched your girlfriend

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:50.494
in your old band.

00:08:50.595 --> 00:08:52.766
Then you sold your
soul for success,

00:08:52.866 --> 00:08:54.736
even though I'm the one
who bought it.

00:08:54.836 --> 00:08:55.437
- Huh?

00:08:55.538 --> 00:08:56.439
My soul?

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:58.911
- You were the full on punk
rocker.

00:08:59.011 --> 00:09:01.984
You were that cool rebel
playing whatever you wanted

00:09:02.084 --> 00:09:05.692
in little dive bars
all over town.

00:09:05.792 --> 00:09:07.662
Well, I mean, you're
still cool now,

00:09:07.762 --> 00:09:09.766
just in a mainstream way.

00:09:15.912 --> 00:09:19.953
- Well, I, for one, wanna
hear Ren Honjo's soul shout.

00:09:28.704 --> 00:09:30.575
- It's weird, don't you think?

00:09:30.675 --> 00:09:32.177
The bigger the empire gets,

00:09:32.277 --> 00:09:34.683
the more confining it feels?

00:09:36.285 --> 00:09:37.121
Before I knew it,

00:09:37.221 --> 00:09:39.358
I went and lugged my
precious little sister

00:09:39.458 --> 00:09:41.697
on the top of the highest tower.

00:09:42.732 --> 00:09:44.703
Even I can't love her there.

00:09:48.443 --> 00:09:51.115
That's the greatest
sin of my life.

00:09:53.821 --> 00:09:56.058
She only knows how to sing.

00:09:56.159 --> 00:09:58.998
She's ignorant about
everything else.

00:09:59.098 --> 00:10:01.737
There's nothing I can
do about it now.

00:10:03.239 --> 00:10:05.812
I can only hope that somewhere,
there's a prince out there

00:10:05.912 --> 00:10:09.118
who'll care enough to climb
that tower and hold her.

00:10:18.804 --> 00:10:21.877
(phone ringing)

00:10:23.346 --> 00:10:23.781
What's wrong with you?

00:10:23.881 --> 00:10:26.119
You don't turn your phone
off during recording?

00:10:26.219 --> 00:10:28.691
- I don't see any recording
going on here.

00:10:28.791 --> 00:10:31.797
- Fine then, just at
least put it on vibrate.

00:10:33.133 --> 00:10:35.370
- Hello darling.

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:36.673
No, that's okay.

00:10:36.774 --> 00:10:38.677
The emperor is in a
foul mood right now,

00:10:38.778 --> 00:10:41.015
so we aren't doing anything.

00:10:41.784 --> 00:10:44.321
Sure, he's right beside me.

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:46.425
- Who the hell is it?

00:10:46.527 --> 00:10:49.265
- Her former prince,
the bald one.

00:10:51.837 --> 00:10:54.810
(light music)

00:10:58.684 --> 00:11:01.924
- Excuse me, but are you
Takumi from Trapnest?

00:11:02.024 --> 00:11:04.161
I am a huge fan of yours.

00:11:04.261 --> 00:11:05.698
Can I shake your hand?

00:11:07.234 --> 00:11:08.871
Thank you so much.

00:11:08.971 --> 00:11:09.739
- [Child] Who's that mommy?

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:11.844
Is he a famous singer?

00:11:11.944 --> 00:11:14.048
- No, I play the bass.

00:11:14.148 --> 00:11:16.987
(child laughs)

00:11:17.956 --> 00:11:19.659
- Wasn't that great?

00:11:32.552 --> 00:11:33.888
- Sorry to bother you.

00:11:33.988 --> 00:11:36.827
I know you're really
busy right now.

00:11:36.927 --> 00:11:38.062
- You know what this does?

00:11:38.162 --> 00:11:40.902
It's gonna make her
hate me all over again.

00:11:42.839 --> 00:11:44.609
But when she told me
she's worthless,

00:11:44.709 --> 00:11:47.014
unless she's a singer,

00:11:47.114 --> 00:11:51.455
I didn't break up with her to
hear her say things like that.

00:11:51.557 --> 00:11:53.727
You better do something about
it.

00:11:54.796 --> 00:11:55.831
- If that's how you feel,

00:11:55.932 --> 00:11:58.637
why don't you do
something about it?

00:11:58.737 --> 00:12:02.077
Being the hated one is
my exclusive right.

00:12:19.512 --> 00:12:21.516
(door clicks)

00:12:21.617 --> 00:12:24.355
(Reira gasps)

00:12:32.906 --> 00:12:35.043
- Yasu, you traitor!

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:39.485
Baldie!

00:12:39.586 --> 00:12:41.255
- Please, calm down.

00:12:41.355 --> 00:12:41.990
It's all right.

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:43.326
I'm not gonna force you
to go anywhere.

00:12:43.426 --> 00:12:46.800
It's okay, they postponed
the recording.

00:12:49.305 --> 00:12:50.240
Takumi arranged at all.

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:52.177
He went by himself and
talked things over

00:12:52.277 --> 00:12:54.048
with the president of
the record label.

00:12:54.148 --> 00:12:57.087
He asked for some time off till
you're ready to sing again.

00:12:57.187 --> 00:12:59.325
We'll still have to
rearrange the schedule a bit,

00:12:59.425 --> 00:13:01.797
but the week you're
supposed to be recording,

00:13:01.897 --> 00:13:04.335
you can take off and do
whatever you want.

00:13:04.435 --> 00:13:05.571
Everything's fine now.

00:13:05.671 --> 00:13:08.711
I know that Takumi might
say harsh things sometimes,

00:13:08.811 --> 00:13:11.148
but he cares a lot about you.

00:13:12.585 --> 00:13:14.488
- [Reira] You're wrong, Mari.

00:13:15.256 --> 00:13:17.260
- Huh?

00:13:17.361 --> 00:13:23.106
- Takumi...Takumi
has abandoned me.

00:13:23.206 --> 00:13:26.546
Who needs a singer who just
runs away from everything?

00:13:26.647 --> 00:13:28.550
(Mari gasps)

00:13:28.651 --> 00:13:29.451
- What are you saying?

00:13:29.552 --> 00:13:31.355
I'm sure that's not true.

00:13:31.455 --> 00:13:32.457
- I'm sorry, Mari.

00:13:32.558 --> 00:13:33.694
I'll go back to the studio now,

00:13:33.794 --> 00:13:37.334
so please contact
everyone, okay?

00:13:37.434 --> 00:13:40.541
- But you couldn't possibly
sing in this condition.

00:13:40.641 --> 00:13:41.743
- Please, I mean it!

00:13:41.843 --> 00:13:44.381
Don't take away my
chance to sing.

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:54.268
Singing is all I have.

00:13:58.076 --> 00:13:59.612
- What an annoying place.

00:13:59.713 --> 00:14:00.982
Enough Trapnest already.

00:14:01.082 --> 00:14:02.351
Hey, play some enka!

00:14:02.451 --> 00:14:04.321
You're ruining our
ramen noodles here, man.

00:14:04.421 --> 00:14:04.956
- I'm sorry.

00:14:05.056 --> 00:14:07.260
We'll eat fast and
get outta here.

00:14:07.929 --> 00:14:08.964
This is satellite radio,

00:14:09.064 --> 00:14:11.102
so of course they're playing
all the popular stuff.

00:14:11.202 --> 00:14:13.139
Besides, it's one of
the songs Ren wrote.

00:14:13.239 --> 00:14:15.443
At least like it for
that reason.

00:14:15.544 --> 00:14:17.982
- This isn't one of Ren's songs.

00:14:18.082 --> 00:14:20.855
- But seriously, I think
you should go see a doctor.

00:14:20.955 --> 00:14:21.790
- A doctor?

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:22.290
- Yeah.

00:14:22.391 --> 00:14:24.863
Don't you think it's kind of
freaky that you blacked out?

00:14:24.963 --> 00:14:26.566
I can go with you if you want.

00:14:26.666 --> 00:14:27.367
- What the hell?

00:14:27.467 --> 00:14:29.506
Why do you keep saying
something's wrong with me?

00:14:29.606 --> 00:14:30.808
It's totally rude.

00:14:30.908 --> 00:14:33.647
- But you've been saying
it as much as I have.

00:14:33.747 --> 00:14:34.849
What if you hit your head

00:14:34.949 --> 00:14:37.555
or you've got some kind
of brain disease?

00:14:37.655 --> 00:14:38.691
Go see a doctor.

00:14:38.791 --> 00:14:40.160
- Listen, I'm totally fine.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.464
Man, I just knew I never
should have told you

00:14:42.565 --> 00:14:43.332
any of that stuff.

00:14:43.433 --> 00:14:46.540
Sometimes you're so
annoying, Nobuo.

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:48.309
That was some good grub.

00:14:48.409 --> 00:14:51.650
Now I'll keep my end of the
bargain and listen to you whine.

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:52.618
- Nah, it's all right.

00:14:52.719 --> 00:14:55.423
If I tell you you'll just
rub salt in the wound.

00:14:55.524 --> 00:14:57.494
- Uh-huh, you're gonna tell
me all of it.

00:14:57.595 --> 00:14:59.999
How can everything turn
to hell in just one day?

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:01.402
- Everything?

00:15:03.907 --> 00:15:05.276
- You really don't know?

00:15:05.377 --> 00:15:07.013
Just what the hell
have you been up to?

00:15:07.114 --> 00:15:07.882
- What about you?

00:15:07.982 --> 00:15:10.120
Where have you been
hiding since last night?

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:11.723
Hachi was going through so much.

00:15:11.823 --> 00:15:14.395
Sometimes you're too cold.

00:15:14.495 --> 00:15:17.502
If you're her friend, you should
have gone to her right away

00:15:17.602 --> 00:15:19.338
and just listened to her.

00:15:20.306 --> 00:15:22.578
She just apologized to me.

00:15:22.678 --> 00:15:24.649
She didn't say anything else.

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:27.320
- You went to see her?

00:15:27.421 --> 00:15:29.091
- Yeah, but you're
her best friend.

00:15:29.191 --> 00:15:32.330
So she might have told you
how she was really feeling.

00:15:32.431 --> 00:15:33.967
- But when I went
home this morning,

00:15:34.067 --> 00:15:35.236
she barely even looked at me.

00:15:35.336 --> 00:15:37.207
She didn't even say one word.

00:15:37.307 --> 00:15:40.146
Takumi did all the
talking for her.

00:15:41.348 --> 00:15:42.384
- What'd he say?

00:15:48.196 --> 00:15:49.999
It's all right, tell me.

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:52.572
At this point, nothing
will shock me.

00:15:55.511 --> 00:15:58.082
- He said they're
getting married.

00:16:04.128 --> 00:16:06.065
You're totally freaking out,
aren't you?

00:16:06.165 --> 00:16:06.933
Who wouldn't freak out?

00:16:07.033 --> 00:16:09.004
I mean it's insane, right?

00:16:13.781 --> 00:16:15.483
I'm sorry, Nobuo.

00:16:15.584 --> 00:16:16.853
Are you all right?

00:16:16.953 --> 00:16:17.755
- Yeah.

00:16:17.855 --> 00:16:19.224
Well, not really.

00:16:19.324 --> 00:16:21.162
I mean, I sort of knew it was
over

00:16:21.262 --> 00:16:23.166
when I saw Nana yesterday.

00:16:23.266 --> 00:16:24.268
- Nana?

00:16:25.136 --> 00:16:28.242
I suppose I knew it all along.

00:16:28.342 --> 00:16:33.486
After everything, she's
still in love with Takumi.

00:16:33.587 --> 00:16:37.595
- [Nana] You always called her
Hachi in front of everyone.

00:16:37.695 --> 00:16:41.736
- The thing is, I was
going out with her before.

00:16:41.837 --> 00:16:43.640
Why hasn't she told me anything?

00:16:45.578 --> 00:16:47.147
Was I irresponsible?

00:16:47.247 --> 00:16:50.420
Was I really that
unavailable to her?

00:16:58.269 --> 00:17:00.674
- It's okay to cry, Nobuo.

00:17:00.774 --> 00:17:02.043
Cry on my shoulder.

00:17:02.143 --> 00:17:03.179
- What are you doing?

00:17:03.279 --> 00:17:04.181
- Don't be embarrassed.

00:17:04.281 --> 00:17:06.018
Come on, we're good
friends, aren't we?

00:17:06.118 --> 00:17:07.487
- But people are staring!

00:17:07.588 --> 00:17:08.122
- Let them stare.

00:17:08.222 --> 00:17:09.993
You're too short to be
acting cool, anyway.

00:17:10.093 --> 00:17:11.195
- Don't call me short.

00:17:11.295 --> 00:17:13.065
At least I'm taller
than you are.

00:17:13.165 --> 00:17:13.634
- I know that.

00:17:13.734 --> 00:17:16.606
And I also know that your
heart is 10 times bigger

00:17:16.706 --> 00:17:18.710
than mine could ever be.

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:23.052
Before I knew you, I hated
everyone and everything.

00:17:23.152 --> 00:17:25.423
I couldn't trust
a single person.

00:17:25.524 --> 00:17:28.764
Then I met you and for the
first time I thought this world

00:17:28.864 --> 00:17:31.435
wasn't such a bad place.

00:17:31.536 --> 00:17:34.308
Terashima, thanks for
letting me these.

00:17:35.611 --> 00:17:40.286
Nobuo, you are not
irresponsible.

00:17:40.386 --> 00:17:44.127
Don't get down on yourself
'cause a girl ditched you.

00:17:51.475 --> 00:17:53.847
- Your spikes are digging into
my neck.

00:17:53.947 --> 00:17:55.551
It kind of hurts.

00:17:58.924 --> 00:18:02.330
- [Nana] Nobuo's shoulders
are way scrawnier than Ren's.

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:05.136
But they weren't shaking.

00:18:05.236 --> 00:18:08.142
I told him to cry on
my shoulder,

00:18:08.242 --> 00:18:11.115
but I ended up crying
on his instead.

00:18:20.066 --> 00:18:22.505
I owe a mountain of
debt to Nobuo.

00:18:24.709 --> 00:18:27.480
So, I can't patch things
up with Hachi.

00:18:31.556 --> 00:18:34.394
I'll take the strawberry
glass to Ren's place.

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:39.137
- I can't use this!

00:18:40.641 --> 00:18:42.410
You staked out his pad for
a month,

00:18:42.511 --> 00:18:45.216
and you couldn't get
one photo of them together?

00:18:45.316 --> 00:18:47.287
- And that's because
their schedules conflict,

00:18:47.387 --> 00:18:49.391
so they don't cross
paths very often.

00:18:49.491 --> 00:18:51.195
Plus, they don't go out
anywhere together.

00:18:51.295 --> 00:18:52.632
- You always have excuses!

00:18:52.732 --> 00:18:55.771
They probably spotted you and
they started being careful.

00:18:55.871 --> 00:18:57.608
Why do we hire such idiots?

00:18:57.708 --> 00:18:59.144
- Why don't we just write the
article

00:18:59.244 --> 00:19:01.115
using our two best shots?

00:19:01.215 --> 00:19:02.484
- Nope, not good enough.

00:19:02.585 --> 00:19:06.325
- You want someone else
to break this story?

00:19:06.425 --> 00:19:11.001
- Kurata, you're gonna fly
to their hometown right away.

00:19:11.101 --> 00:19:12.003
- Huh?

00:19:12.103 --> 00:19:14.107
- Trapnest is gonna be
recording in the studio

00:19:14.207 --> 00:19:15.678
every day this week.

00:19:15.778 --> 00:19:16.746
No action there.

00:19:16.846 --> 00:19:18.750
So while that's going
on, you're gonna dig up

00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:22.157
whatever information you can
on Ren Honjo and Nana Osaki

00:19:22.257 --> 00:19:23.860
- Want a drag.

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:26.833
- Gaia seems to be dropping the
ball on Blast's debut album.

00:19:26.933 --> 00:19:29.973
But this will still be
the hottest gossip around.

00:19:30.073 --> 00:19:31.943
I'll shoot up some big
fireworks,

00:19:32.043 --> 00:19:32.444
and before you know it,

00:19:32.545 --> 00:19:36.418
Blast will be thrown into
the same ring as Trapnest.

00:19:36.519 --> 00:19:39.324
You ought be thanking me, Nana
Osaki.

00:19:39.424 --> 00:19:43.800
It'll be the ultimate battle of
the bands.

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:44.869
- [Mailman] Miss Komatsu?

00:19:44.969 --> 00:19:46.472
Courier delivery.

00:19:47.374 --> 00:19:50.748
(light rock music)

00:20:00.333 --> 00:20:03.339
(Nana K gasps)

00:20:08.215 --> 00:20:10.253
- [Nana O] Hey Hachi.

00:20:10.353 --> 00:20:12.223
I was hostile towards Trapnest

00:20:12.323 --> 00:20:15.196
'cause I was jealous of Reira.

00:20:15.296 --> 00:20:19.204
She stole Ren's heart,
not romantically,

00:20:19.304 --> 00:20:21.543
but as a lead singer.

00:20:23.112 --> 00:20:25.584
I just wanted to be
as big as Ren.

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:29.759
I never meant to make
them my enemy.

00:20:29.859 --> 00:20:31.028
- Damn, it's beautiful.

00:20:31.128 --> 00:20:33.834
This'll sell way more
than a million.

00:20:33.934 --> 00:20:37.073
- Tell me, how much harder
are you gonna push her?

00:20:37.173 --> 00:20:38.476
- I don't know what you mean.

00:20:38.577 --> 00:20:39.612
- Huh?

00:20:44.922 --> 00:20:48.730
- At least let me accompany
her with my guitar.

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:51.736
Since you won't let
me give her a hug.

00:20:56.646 --> 00:20:57.948
- [Nana O] But ever since
that day

00:20:58.048 --> 00:20:59.752
you were taken away from me,

00:21:00.988 --> 00:21:03.492
I was determined to crush them.

00:21:06.966 --> 00:21:10.607
I was gonna steal you
back, no matter what.
