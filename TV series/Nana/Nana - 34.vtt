WEBVTT

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.018
- Trapnest.

00:00:07.118 --> 00:00:10.659
A motherly nest that
comes with a trap.

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:13.364
Once you're in there,
you can never get out.

00:00:15.168 --> 00:00:17.573
Only a guy who's totally
possessive would come

00:00:17.673 --> 00:00:19.877
up with a name like that.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.787
(rock music begins)

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:03.918
(traffic moving)

00:02:09.496 --> 00:02:12.402
(traffic moving)

00:02:20.051 --> 00:02:24.593
- [Kinoshita] Mr. Honjo?
Um. Mr Honjo?

00:02:24.694 --> 00:02:25.428
- Huh?

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:26.931
- Uh, sorry to wake you up,

00:02:27.031 --> 00:02:28.067
but we're at your apartment

00:02:28.167 --> 00:02:30.037
and I can't quite figure
out how you're supposed

00:02:30.137 --> 00:02:32.108
to open the garage door.

00:02:32.208 --> 00:02:35.214
- Oh, you gotta stick
the key in.

00:02:35.314 --> 00:02:36.216
- Key?

00:02:36.316 --> 00:02:37.619
- The card key.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.955
You stick it in that box.

00:02:39.055 --> 00:02:41.059
It's so annoying.

00:02:42.161 --> 00:02:43.932
It's pretty late, isn't it?

00:02:44.032 --> 00:02:46.637
So how are you planning
to get home, Kinoshita?

00:02:46.738 --> 00:02:48.374
- I was gonna catch a cab.

00:02:48.474 --> 00:02:50.545
- Why don't you just take
my car?

00:02:50.646 --> 00:02:52.549
- What?! Are you serious?

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.889
- Just promise me you'll come
back to pick me up tomorrow.

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:56.691
- No problem.

00:02:56.791 --> 00:02:57.392
Hey, if you want,

00:02:57.492 --> 00:03:00.131
I can pick you up and
drop you off every day.

00:03:00.231 --> 00:03:02.168
You're so tired from your
busy schedule,

00:03:02.268 --> 00:03:04.740
it'd be dangerous for
you to drive.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.778
Just imagine if you got
into an accident

00:03:06.878 --> 00:03:09.049
and completely totaled
this amazing car.

00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:10.852
- You're more worried
about the car than me?

00:03:10.952 --> 00:03:14.727
- But this is a
1965 Mustang Shelby!

00:03:14.827 --> 00:03:15.896
- I don't care what I drive.

00:03:15.996 --> 00:03:17.800
As long as it runs,
it's fine with me.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.839
But Takumi insisted
I drive this thing.

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:22.543
Something to do with my image.

00:03:22.643 --> 00:03:25.314
- You know, Mr. Honjo,
it's kinda weird.

00:03:25.414 --> 00:03:27.553
You've got lots of
money and talent

00:03:27.653 --> 00:03:29.924
but you're not greedy at all.

00:03:30.024 --> 00:03:31.026
Even your songs,

00:03:31.126 --> 00:03:33.598
you write them just like
Mr. Ichinose tells you to

00:03:33.698 --> 00:03:37.840
but you sound so much better
when you play punk rock.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.744
- As long as I get
to play guitar,

00:03:39.844 --> 00:03:41.313
everything's cool with me.

00:03:41.413 --> 00:03:45.956
- Well, I for one wanna
hear Ren Honjo's soul shout!

00:03:46.056 --> 00:03:47.826
- You wanna hear my soul shout?

00:03:47.926 --> 00:03:48.995
(Ren laughs)

00:03:49.095 --> 00:03:50.699
- Yeah well, you should know

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:51.768
you're not the only one who does

00:03:51.868 --> 00:03:54.740
whatever Mr. Ichinose
tells you to do.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:55.842
You didn't hear this from me

00:03:55.942 --> 00:04:00.819
but everyone's calling us
Takumi's Trapnest soldiers.

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:02.455
- And who is everyone?

00:04:02.556 --> 00:04:05.996
- Ah, I mean, Mr. Ichinose is
uber-talented at what he does

00:04:06.096 --> 00:04:08.267
and he clearly has
leadership skills.

00:04:08.367 --> 00:04:11.106
He might talk big, but
at least he backs it up.

00:04:11.206 --> 00:04:13.210
I totally respect the man.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.448
- Then tell that to everyone.

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:18.955
If you don't like how
Takumi runs things then go.

00:04:19.055 --> 00:04:23.230
We have no use for soldiers
who aren't on our side.

00:04:23.865 --> 00:04:26.938
(low rock guitar)

00:04:34.052 --> 00:04:35.354
- I can't come up with anything.

00:04:35.454 --> 00:04:37.960
I have to write another dumb
love ballad.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.830
- Don't even think of
looking at me for help.

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.638
- Ugh. Why do I always have
to write stupid love songs?

00:04:43.738 --> 00:04:44.673
Why are they with cells?

00:04:44.774 --> 00:04:47.746
Why are Japanese people
so into mushy love stuff?

00:04:47.846 --> 00:04:50.351
I wanna write about
world peace or something.

00:04:50.451 --> 00:04:53.758
Not that I know much about it,
but still.

00:04:53.858 --> 00:04:55.027
What am I gonna do?

00:04:55.127 --> 00:04:57.933
We start recording tomorrow.

00:04:58.033 --> 00:05:00.572
- Technically, you begin today.

00:05:02.843 --> 00:05:04.312
- Huh?

00:05:04.412 --> 00:05:07.385
Shin, why are you being
so mean to me today?

00:05:07.485 --> 00:05:11.460
- Am I? Maybe it's because
I'm tired of being a good boy.

00:05:11.561 --> 00:05:12.796
- A good boy?

00:05:12.896 --> 00:05:13.698
When are you good?

00:05:13.798 --> 00:05:16.336
- This whole month I haven't
skipped a single practice.

00:05:16.436 --> 00:05:18.608
I didn't smoke in the
non-smoking studio

00:05:18.708 --> 00:05:19.877
and I changed up my sound

00:05:19.977 --> 00:05:22.248
just like our A and R
guy told us to.

00:05:22.348 --> 00:05:24.385
It's getting really boring.

00:05:24.486 --> 00:05:24.687
- What?

00:05:24.787 --> 00:05:28.060
Gaia doesn't let you smoke
in their recording studios?

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.599
But all the studios we've
been in let us smoke.

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:33.605
Then why would musicians
even wanna record there?

00:05:33.705 --> 00:05:35.241
- It's a teaching studio.

00:05:35.341 --> 00:05:37.378
There's a music school
attached to it

00:05:37.478 --> 00:05:40.017
that uses the studios
for their students.

00:05:40.117 --> 00:05:42.054
- Wow. They have their
own school?

00:05:42.155 --> 00:05:44.292
That's just so Gaia, isn't it?

00:05:44.392 --> 00:05:46.096
So, if you get good grades

00:05:46.196 --> 00:05:47.799
will they let you be on
their label?

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:48.668
- I don't know.

00:05:48.768 --> 00:05:50.772
Honestly, I couldn't care less.

00:05:50.872 --> 00:05:52.576
So what if we release an album,

00:05:52.676 --> 00:05:53.945
a single or whatever?

00:05:54.045 --> 00:05:55.882
All I ever wanted to do was play

00:05:55.982 --> 00:05:57.986
in a band and have some fun.

00:05:58.086 --> 00:05:59.322
- Huh.

00:06:00.257 --> 00:06:01.393
Yeah, you're right!

00:06:01.493 --> 00:06:03.463
Music is something that
should be enjoyed.

00:06:03.565 --> 00:06:05.502
Let's go out and dance
like crazy all night long

00:06:05.602 --> 00:06:07.673
until we forget all
our problems.

00:06:07.773 --> 00:06:09.309
Come on!

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:11.179
- What are you talking about?

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:13.183
Reira, this is your job.

00:06:13.283 --> 00:06:16.524
People pay you for this so
you've gotta take it seriously.

00:06:16.624 --> 00:06:18.528
- Aw.

00:06:18.628 --> 00:06:21.366
- Come on, now. You just
need to concentrate.

00:06:21.466 --> 00:06:23.671
You can release all your
frustrations by writing

00:06:23.771 --> 00:06:25.508
down whatever's on your mind.

00:06:25.609 --> 00:06:26.276
- Fine then.

00:06:26.376 --> 00:06:29.282
Maybe I'll write about
squashing all those mosquitoes.

00:06:29.382 --> 00:06:31.486
- As long as it makes
a good love ballad.

00:06:31.587 --> 00:06:32.689
- Hmph.

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:38.166
Mmm.

00:06:40.404 --> 00:06:43.778
(quiet piano music)

00:06:54.032 --> 00:06:57.104
(Reira singing)

00:07:06.323 --> 00:07:07.258
- Hey, are you hungry?

00:07:07.358 --> 00:07:10.599
Do you mind if I order
up some room service?

00:07:10.699 --> 00:07:13.538
(Reira singing)

00:07:28.166 --> 00:07:31.239
- Reira was in love with Takumi.

00:07:40.659 --> 00:07:43.497
(Reira crying)

00:07:52.783 --> 00:07:55.087
- What a beautiful song.

00:07:57.191 --> 00:07:59.997
Ren is such a genius.

00:08:00.097 --> 00:08:04.038
It'll be ruined by whatever
stupid lyrics I add to it.

00:08:04.138 --> 00:08:05.709
I just know it.

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:09.650
- That's impossible.

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:11.921
Any love story written
by someone who cries

00:08:12.021 --> 00:08:16.062
with as much emotion as you
do could never be shallow.

00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:19.503
Don't you realize that so
many girls love Trapnest

00:08:19.603 --> 00:08:21.507
'cause they connect with
your lyrics

00:08:21.607 --> 00:08:23.443
and the way you
sing them?

00:08:23.978 --> 00:08:25.214
- You think so?

00:08:25.314 --> 00:08:26.449
You're such a flatterer

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:28.655
- Of course I am. This is my
job.

00:08:28.755 --> 00:08:31.126
People pay me for this.

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:35.167
I'm dead serious.

00:08:50.197 --> 00:08:51.534
- [Yasu] Don't you
have a lady friend

00:08:51.634 --> 00:08:53.203
to hang out with instead?

00:08:53.303 --> 00:08:55.474
- [Naoki] I can't. It
would cause a scandal.

00:08:55.575 --> 00:08:58.146
- You're being way too
self-conscious about this.

00:08:58.246 --> 00:09:00.217
Even Ren and Takumi do whatever
they want

00:09:00.317 --> 00:09:01.219
and it hasn't been a problem.

00:09:01.319 --> 00:09:03.958
- But there's been a
problem. A real problem.

00:09:04.058 --> 00:09:06.630
There's papa-rakkyo
hanging around everywhere

00:09:06.731 --> 00:09:08.801
and your singer's in
and out of Ren's place

00:09:08.901 --> 00:09:10.204
like she's living there.

00:09:10.304 --> 00:09:11.439
You need to talk to that woman.

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:14.045
- What do you mean papa-rakkyo?

00:09:14.145 --> 00:09:15.214
- Paparazzi.

00:09:15.314 --> 00:09:15.882
- Oh, really?

00:09:15.982 --> 00:09:17.953
- Yep. They've been
targeting all of us

00:09:18.053 --> 00:09:20.925
but I'm the only one being
careful enough not to be seen.

00:09:21.025 --> 00:09:24.265
The agency has Reira hiding
out in a hotel somewhere

00:09:24.365 --> 00:09:26.971
and I have a feeling Takumi
went over to Hachiko's.

00:09:27.071 --> 00:09:30.979
He was acting really weird
all day, then rushed home.

00:09:31.079 --> 00:09:32.014
- Huh? Hachiko?

00:09:32.114 --> 00:09:33.350
- Her real name's Nana, right?

00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:34.720
I've never actually met her
before

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:36.690
but from what I hear,
she's a big schemer.

00:09:36.791 --> 00:09:38.895
She sounds like she's
really something.

00:09:38.995 --> 00:09:40.130
One day she wants to see you,

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:41.534
the next day she blocks
your calls.

00:09:41.634 --> 00:09:43.470
She knows how to play
the game.

00:09:43.571 --> 00:09:45.809
She's a good cook and
she's great in bed.

00:09:45.909 --> 00:09:49.248
I mean even Takumi
can't resist that combo.

00:09:49.348 --> 00:09:50.484
- Naoki, I think you might

00:09:50.585 --> 00:09:52.388
be over embellishing
things a bit?

00:09:52.488 --> 00:09:55.360
Besides, I thought
those two had broken up.

00:09:55.461 --> 00:09:57.431
- No, I doubt that'll happen.

00:09:57.532 --> 00:10:00.003
There's no way Takumi's
gonna let this girl go

00:10:00.104 --> 00:10:01.974
without putting up a big fight.

00:10:02.074 --> 00:10:03.778
He's an idiot for it though.

00:10:03.878 --> 00:10:05.380
Being played like that.

00:10:12.228 --> 00:10:12.929
- I told you to come to me

00:10:13.029 --> 00:10:15.434
after you'd worked things
out with Takumi.

00:10:15.535 --> 00:10:18.240
- But, I did. That's why I came.

00:10:20.477 --> 00:10:22.883
- [Takumi] Why aren't you
saying anything?

00:10:27.491 --> 00:10:28.093
Say something!

00:10:28.193 --> 00:10:30.665
Are you gonna step up or
just walk away from this?

00:10:30.765 --> 00:10:33.704
The baby's growing inside
of her as we speak.

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:37.913
- What's going on?

00:10:38.013 --> 00:10:40.451
Hello? Hachiko? It's me Nana.

00:10:41.352 --> 00:10:43.658
- Oh, Nana, you're there too.

00:10:45.962 --> 00:10:47.131
- Takumi?.

00:10:47.231 --> 00:10:48.333
- [Takumi] Perfect timing.

00:10:48.433 --> 00:10:51.172
I wanted to talk to you too.

00:10:51.272 --> 00:10:52.642
Can you and Nobu come over here?

00:10:52.742 --> 00:10:54.980
We shouldn't do this
over the phone.

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.650
- Come over where?

00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:59.790
And why are you calling
from Hachiko's cell phone?

00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:01.660
- I'm just borrowing
it for a bit.

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.698
I'm over at your place
right now.

00:11:03.798 --> 00:11:05.467
- What are you doing
at our place?

00:11:05.568 --> 00:11:07.471
And stay the hell
away from Hachi.

00:11:07.572 --> 00:11:09.610
Don't you know she's
with Nobu now?

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:15.087
- I know that, but he didn't
stay away from my girlfriend.

00:11:15.187 --> 00:11:16.524
- Where's Hachi?

00:11:16.624 --> 00:11:17.592
- [Takumi] She's here.

00:11:17.692 --> 00:11:19.028
- [Nana] Put her on the phone.

00:11:19.128 --> 00:11:20.632
I'm not talking to you.

00:11:23.671 --> 00:11:26.376
- Nana, Nana wants
to talk to you.

00:11:35.728 --> 00:11:38.534
I don't think she can
talk to you right now.

00:11:38.634 --> 00:11:40.037
- [Nana] What did you do to her?

00:11:40.137 --> 00:11:41.439
- You've got it all wrong.

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:42.374
I didn't do anything.

00:11:42.474 --> 00:11:44.245
- Whatever.
We'll be there right away.

00:11:44.345 --> 00:11:45.380
We're not very far.

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.282
- [Takumi] Really?

00:11:46.382 --> 00:11:48.119
Then could you pick up
some grapefruit

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:50.658
and sparkling water on your way?

00:11:50.758 --> 00:11:51.459
- What?!

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:53.129
- [Takumi] I think she needs it
right now.

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:55.702
Her morning sickness
is pretty bad.

00:11:55.802 --> 00:11:56.804
Thanks.

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:15.407
- Morning sickness?

00:12:21.587 --> 00:12:23.524
Morning sickness?

00:12:23.624 --> 00:12:24.927
- I'll have a grapefruit juice.

00:12:25.027 --> 00:12:26.997
Oh, it's just some stomach
thing.

00:12:27.097 --> 00:12:27.632
I'm alright.

00:12:27.732 --> 00:12:31.640
I can't really explain it,
it's like maternal instinct.

00:12:34.211 --> 00:12:34.947
- Nobu.

00:12:35.047 --> 00:12:39.690
Listen, when you did it with
Hachi did you use condoms?

00:12:42.361 --> 00:12:43.129
Answer me!

00:12:43.229 --> 00:12:44.298
- Of course I did.

00:12:44.398 --> 00:12:45.768
- Every time?

00:12:45.868 --> 00:12:46.369
- Yeah.

00:12:46.469 --> 00:12:48.073
- Before you went inside her?

00:12:48.173 --> 00:12:48.908
- Yeah!

00:12:49.008 --> 00:12:49.442
- You're a liar.

00:12:49.543 --> 00:12:51.246
You did it at least once
without a condom.

00:12:51.346 --> 00:12:53.383
- No, I never did.

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:57.959
- Oh, why are you so damn
serious all the time?

00:12:58.059 --> 00:12:59.262
Argh!

00:12:59.362 --> 00:13:02.434
(Nana panting)

00:13:03.738 --> 00:13:06.810
- What do you mean by serious?

00:13:07.579 --> 00:13:08.981
What's wrong with being serious?

00:13:09.081 --> 00:13:10.618
I don't have the money
to raise a kid

00:13:10.718 --> 00:13:12.956
so of course I wear condoms.

00:13:19.368 --> 00:13:20.605
- It's Takumi's baby.

00:13:20.705 --> 00:13:22.408
- What are you crying for?

00:13:22.509 --> 00:13:23.878
I should be the one crying.

00:13:23.978 --> 00:13:26.382
- You have to tell her
that it isn't your kid.

00:13:26.482 --> 00:13:27.919
Then I'm sure she
won't wanna have it.

00:13:28.019 --> 00:13:31.392
- If I tell her that, it'll
sound like I'm irresponsible.

00:13:31.492 --> 00:13:32.494
I had sex with her too

00:13:32.595 --> 00:13:35.500
so there is a chance
that it is my baby.

00:13:35.601 --> 00:13:37.772
Besides, I think Hachi probably

00:13:37.872 --> 00:13:40.712
already knows that it's
Takumi's.

00:13:40.812 --> 00:13:44.385
That's why she told him first.

00:13:44.485 --> 00:13:47.692
Otherwise I can't see
why she'd wanna see him.

00:13:47.792 --> 00:13:49.930
I mean, there is
no other reason.

00:13:51.032 --> 00:13:54.071
- He didn't stay away
from my girlfriend.

00:14:02.789 --> 00:14:05.528
- You can still become
the baby's father.

00:14:09.435 --> 00:14:10.972
- What are you talking about?

00:14:11.072 --> 00:14:14.011
You say it like it
would be so easy.

00:14:16.215 --> 00:14:17.519
- I know we can get the money.

00:14:17.619 --> 00:14:19.021
We're gonna be on a big label
soon.

00:14:19.121 --> 00:14:22.194
And I can't imagine Takumi
would take responsibility

00:14:22.294 --> 00:14:23.597
for an accident.

00:14:23.698 --> 00:14:25.033
- He said he would.

00:14:25.133 --> 00:14:25.835
- Huh?

00:14:25.935 --> 00:14:27.839
- Even if it turns out to be
my child.

00:14:27.939 --> 00:14:30.745
- He's just saying that so
he can take Hachi away from us.

00:14:30.845 --> 00:14:33.416
Don't you realize that
he's just using the baby

00:14:33.517 --> 00:14:34.385
to make her his?

00:14:34.485 --> 00:14:36.890
- You're doing the exact
same thing.

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:40.765
You're just manipulating
me to get Hachi aren't you?

00:14:42.167 --> 00:14:44.639
God, give me a break.

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:46.342
What's wrong with you anyway?

00:14:46.442 --> 00:14:50.283
If you want this so much, why
don't you become the father?

00:14:52.889 --> 00:14:55.127
But I doubt you could
ever love a child

00:14:55.227 --> 00:14:57.030
that belongs to Takumi.

00:14:58.333 --> 00:15:01.205
(heart beating)

00:15:05.915 --> 00:15:07.919
- [Nana] There's no way I could.

00:15:22.649 --> 00:15:23.918
No.

00:15:25.153 --> 00:15:26.890
Don't have that baby.

00:15:28.928 --> 00:15:31.934
- Those two sure are taking
their time.

00:15:33.403 --> 00:15:35.541
Please try not to get too upset.

00:15:35.641 --> 00:15:37.344
Why don't you go lie down?

00:15:37.444 --> 00:15:40.450
You don't want to have
a miscarriage.

00:15:40.551 --> 00:15:43.791
You know, you seem a
little heavier.

00:15:43.891 --> 00:15:45.460
I thought women usually
lost weight

00:15:45.561 --> 00:15:47.932
because of morning sickness.

00:15:48.032 --> 00:15:51.072
My older sister had really
bad morning sickness too.

00:15:51.172 --> 00:15:53.076
I was in 11th grade
and she was 20.

00:15:53.176 --> 00:15:55.447
She got married because
of the baby.

00:15:55.548 --> 00:15:56.717
Her husband's not like me.

00:15:56.817 --> 00:15:58.486
He's a hard working class guy,

00:15:58.587 --> 00:15:59.856
very reliable,

00:15:59.956 --> 00:16:01.860
but I got so pissed when I found
out,

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:04.498
well, I beat him up pretty bad.

00:16:04.599 --> 00:16:06.804
My sister cried and
Reira laughed

00:16:06.904 --> 00:16:08.874
at me for being so possessive.

00:16:08.974 --> 00:16:10.678
It was pretty bad.

00:16:13.517 --> 00:16:15.053
Hey, you're also 20

00:16:15.153 --> 00:16:18.159
but you already know you're
a confused 20 year old,

00:16:18.259 --> 00:16:19.428
don't you Nana?

00:16:19.529 --> 00:16:20.965
You don't have a steady job,

00:16:21.065 --> 00:16:23.504
you sleep with guys
whenever you get lonely

00:16:23.604 --> 00:16:25.273
and now you're pregnant.

00:16:25.373 --> 00:16:26.810
You are a mess.

00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:29.215
Your parents are gonna cry.

00:16:29.315 --> 00:16:32.054
But I shouldn't be the one
lecturing you.

00:16:35.327 --> 00:16:37.565
Regardless of who
the father might be,

00:16:37.665 --> 00:16:41.105
you are definitely the
mother of this child.

00:16:41.205 --> 00:16:42.642
So be strong.

00:16:44.345 --> 00:16:47.685
(soft piano music)

00:16:54.131 --> 00:16:55.400
(doorbell rings)

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:56.302
(Nana gasps)

00:16:56.402 --> 00:16:58.106
Finally, they're here.

00:17:15.307 --> 00:17:18.046
(Nana crying)

00:17:22.354 --> 00:17:23.489
Well, it's about time.

00:17:23.591 --> 00:17:25.060
I thought you ran away.

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:27.632
You're alone?

00:17:27.732 --> 00:17:28.667
What happened to Nana?

00:17:28.767 --> 00:17:29.335
- Hell if I know.

00:17:29.435 --> 00:17:34.278
- Oh man, I really hope she
didn't run off to Ren's again.

00:17:34.378 --> 00:17:37.251
Oh, did you get the
grapefruit I asked for?

00:17:37.351 --> 00:17:38.386
- Huh?

00:17:43.764 --> 00:17:46.068
- You're not very
useful, are you?

00:17:46.168 --> 00:17:48.206
Fine. I'll go get some myself.

00:17:48.306 --> 00:17:51.914
There's nothing for us to
really talk about, anyway.

00:17:52.014 --> 00:17:53.349
Nana will decide what to do.

00:17:53.449 --> 00:17:56.455
This child isn't gonna
need two fathers.

00:18:00.665 --> 00:18:03.403
(door slams)

00:18:15.728 --> 00:18:19.468
- Nana? Is it true
that you're pregnant?

00:18:22.809 --> 00:18:25.280
Hey, I just want to hear
it from you.

00:18:25.948 --> 00:18:27.585
It could be my child.

00:18:27.685 --> 00:18:29.421
You don't have to hide from me.

00:18:29.522 --> 00:18:33.229
And I already knew that you'd
just broken up with Takumi.

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:36.469
- I'm sorry.

00:18:47.357 --> 00:18:49.261
- I don't get it.

00:18:49.361 --> 00:18:52.267
Why are you apologizing?

00:18:52.367 --> 00:18:55.140
You did break up with him,
didn't you?

00:19:11.606 --> 00:19:13.811
Please just make up an excuse.

00:19:13.911 --> 00:19:16.115
Do it for my sake.

00:19:16.215 --> 00:19:18.486
Even if it's a lie,
I don't care.

00:19:18.587 --> 00:19:20.156
I'll believe anything.

00:19:22.929 --> 00:19:24.465
- I'm so sorry.

00:19:33.116 --> 00:19:36.823
(violin music begins)

00:19:42.602 --> 00:19:45.574
- [Shinichi] Don't ever let
go of this hand you hold,

00:19:45.675 --> 00:19:46.543
even though there's no ring

00:19:46.643 --> 00:19:50.785
or red string tying a vow
to this trembling finger.

00:19:50.885 --> 00:19:52.020
- Don't read it out loud,

00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:53.657
it's so embarrassing.

00:19:53.757 --> 00:19:55.828
Even I think it's bad.

00:19:55.928 --> 00:19:58.433
I really need to hire
myself a ghost writer.

00:19:58.534 --> 00:20:00.370
(Shinichi laughs)

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:03.711
- Hey, what do you mean
by "a string tying a vow"?

00:20:03.811 --> 00:20:05.413
- What? You don't get it?

00:20:05.514 --> 00:20:06.248
- No?

00:20:06.349 --> 00:20:08.052
- It's the invisible thread that
binds you

00:20:08.152 --> 00:20:09.254
to your fated lover

00:20:09.355 --> 00:20:11.092
and it's tied around your little
finger.

00:20:11.192 --> 00:20:13.396
- Whoa, I bet that's the sort of
stuff

00:20:13.496 --> 00:20:15.033
girls really fall for.

00:20:15.133 --> 00:20:16.268
- But, I don't really believe

00:20:16.369 --> 00:20:18.406
that fate controls who
and how we love.

00:20:18.507 --> 00:20:21.078
I like to think that
people are bound by trust.

00:20:21.178 --> 00:20:24.686
It doesn't matter what kind
of relationship they're in.

00:20:24.786 --> 00:20:27.692
- Oh, and that's the
hand you hold?

00:20:27.792 --> 00:20:31.065
- Maybe it's just because I
haven't found a boyfriend.

00:20:31.165 --> 00:20:33.102
- It's a really good song.

00:20:35.508 --> 00:20:36.643
- Thanks, Shin.

00:20:36.743 --> 00:20:38.379
You really made me feel better

00:20:38.479 --> 00:20:42.087
and I've gotta be in top form
if I wanna go platinum again.

00:20:46.462 --> 00:20:47.865
- [Nana] Hey, Hachi,

00:20:49.669 --> 00:20:52.642
I wanted to keep you beside me.

00:20:52.742 --> 00:20:56.415
Even if that meant putting
a collar around your neck.

00:20:58.219 --> 00:21:00.490
I was afraid of myself,
you know,

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:06.402
and that's why I always kept
a little distance between us.

00:21:06.503 --> 00:21:09.374
Even now I don't make
friends very easily

00:21:10.811 --> 00:21:12.347
'cause I'm still afraid.
