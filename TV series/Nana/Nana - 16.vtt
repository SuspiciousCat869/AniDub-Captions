00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:03.830
- [Nana K.] Back in those days

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.103
I didn't really know how to love
someone.

00:00:07.203 --> 00:00:10.610
But I wanted so much to be
loved.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.752
("rose" by Anna Tsuchiya)

00:01:49.775 --> 00:01:53.248
- [Kyosuke] What the hell?

00:01:53.348 --> 00:01:55.152
I thought you went over
there to comfort her,

00:01:55.252 --> 00:01:56.589
not to give her a lecture.

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:58.660
What good's that gonna do?

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.296
- It just came out that way.

00:02:00.396 --> 00:02:02.166
- [Kyosuke] You know, you don't
have to be brutally honest

00:02:02.266 --> 00:02:04.805
with someone when they've
just had their heart broken.

00:02:04.905 --> 00:02:05.707
- [Junko] Oh, come on.

00:02:05.807 --> 00:02:06.842
It was for her own good.

00:02:06.942 --> 00:02:09.213
- Yeah. But it wasn't very
considerate.

00:02:09.314 --> 00:02:11.051
- When else was she gonna
listen?

00:02:11.151 --> 00:02:13.823
- Hey, good evening guys!

00:02:13.923 --> 00:02:15.359
- Nobo, why are you here?

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:16.862
What happened to Koichi?

00:02:16.963 --> 00:02:19.233
He's got a cold so he took the
day off.

00:02:19.334 --> 00:02:19.969
- Oh yeah?

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.406
I guess it must be the weather.

00:02:22.507 --> 00:02:24.945
Would you mind getting us
a couple beers to start?

00:02:25.045 --> 00:02:26.949
- [Nobo] Sure thing.

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:29.822
- Whatcha doin' trying
to hide from us, Shoji?

00:02:29.922 --> 00:02:32.426
(Shoji grumbles)

00:02:32.527 --> 00:02:32.995
- Don't mind me.

00:02:33.095 --> 00:02:34.063
I'm just a character who's

00:02:34.163 --> 00:02:35.432
on his way out of the story.

00:02:35.533 --> 00:02:36.201
- Don't be so sure.

00:02:36.301 --> 00:02:37.771
We can all still see you.

00:02:37.871 --> 00:02:38.706
- But for how long?

00:02:38.806 --> 00:02:39.608
- Come on and drink with us.

00:02:39.708 --> 00:02:40.677
- Hey, let go!

00:02:40.777 --> 00:02:42.113
- You just can't
cope with the fact

00:02:42.213 --> 00:02:43.015
that you're gonna be stuck

00:02:43.115 --> 00:02:44.718
in this story knowing
that everyone watching

00:02:44.818 --> 00:02:46.454
is gonna hate you
for what you did

00:02:46.555 --> 00:02:49.227
and call you all kinds of names.

00:02:49.327 --> 00:02:51.732
- I should have known
better than to come here.

00:02:51.832 --> 00:02:52.701
- So how's work?

00:02:52.801 --> 00:02:53.670
You got the day off?

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:54.538
- No, sir.

00:02:54.638 --> 00:02:55.507
Because it's golden week,

00:02:55.607 --> 00:02:56.809
I finished my shift early.

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:58.713
- Stop talkin' like that.

00:02:58.813 --> 00:03:01.217
- I went over to see Nana.

00:03:01.317 --> 00:03:03.523
You should know that she
is really mad at you.

00:03:03.623 --> 00:03:04.490
I think it's probably best

00:03:04.591 --> 00:03:07.664
if you steer clear of
her for a while, okay?

00:03:07.764 --> 00:03:10.904
- Are you sure steering
clear is the right way to go?

00:03:11.004 --> 00:03:13.075
- Shoji knows he screwed
up big time with Nana,

00:03:13.175 --> 00:03:14.678
so he wants a chance to
talk with her about it.

00:03:14.778 --> 00:03:17.116
But really I don't think
that's a good idea right now.

00:03:17.216 --> 00:03:19.420
- Okay. But what does he wanna
say to her?

00:03:19.521 --> 00:03:20.623
- Some lame excuse?

00:03:20.724 --> 00:03:22.894
- [Shoji] No! There's no excuse!

00:03:22.994 --> 00:03:24.197
- [Kyosuke] Hm.

00:03:26.434 --> 00:03:27.136
- It's just..

00:03:27.236 --> 00:03:29.541
I think she at least
deserves an apology from me.

00:03:29.641 --> 00:03:30.175
- Come on.

00:03:30.275 --> 00:03:31.979
If you don't intend to get
back together with Nana,

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:33.883
you need to break things off
completely.

00:03:33.983 --> 00:03:35.687
- You know you hurt Nana and
Sachiko.

00:03:35.787 --> 00:03:36.689
'Cause of you're trying to have
your

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:38.593
cake and eat it too attitude.

00:03:38.693 --> 00:03:40.229
Figure it out, dude.

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:41.866
(Shoji grumbles)

00:03:41.966 --> 00:03:42.734
The way I see it,

00:03:42.834 --> 00:03:43.903
you don't wanna apologize to
Nana

00:03:44.003 --> 00:03:46.074
'cause you care about her.

00:03:48.813 --> 00:03:49.848
You wanna apologize

00:03:49.948 --> 00:03:51.819
'cause you think it'll
make you feel better.

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:52.621
- Huh?

00:03:52.721 --> 00:03:56.127
- Now who's the one dishing out
the brutal honesty, Kyosuke?

00:03:56.227 --> 00:03:57.931
- He's a guy, so it's different.

00:03:58.031 --> 00:03:58.966
Go easy on the women.

00:03:59.067 --> 00:04:00.436
Tell it like it is to the men.

00:04:00.537 --> 00:04:01.639
That's my motto.

00:04:02.641 --> 00:04:03.876
- Nobo, I'm gonna pay up.

00:04:03.976 --> 00:04:05.547
I need to head out.

00:04:05.647 --> 00:04:06.849
- Are you running away?

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:09.020
- [Shoji] No, but I
hear what you're saying.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.592
I'm gonna make myself scarce for
a while.

00:04:11.692 --> 00:04:12.961
- [Kyosuke] Where?

00:04:13.061 --> 00:04:15.132
- [Junko] What's with the
flowers?

00:04:15.232 --> 00:04:16.468
- Oh, they're nothing.

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:17.103
See you later!

00:04:17.203 --> 00:04:18.371
- [Nobo] Uh, Shoji.

00:04:18.472 --> 00:04:19.006
- Yeah, what?

00:04:19.107 --> 00:04:20.510
Just let me get outta here.

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:21.679
- The hat.

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:23.683
It belongs to the bar.

00:04:23.783 --> 00:04:25.987
(laughs nervously) Yeah.

00:04:26.087 --> 00:04:26.922
Thanks for coming!

00:04:27.022 --> 00:04:28.391
See you soon!

00:04:28.993 --> 00:04:30.262
- What a dork.

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.509
- [Nobo] I think it's his
girlfriend's birthday tomorrow.

00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:37.109
- What?

00:04:37.209 --> 00:04:37.911
- You mean Sachiko?

00:04:38.011 --> 00:04:39.848
Well, I guess that explains the
flowers.

00:04:39.948 --> 00:04:41.017
- She's at work right now,

00:04:41.117 --> 00:04:42.419
but he didn't wanna wait till
tomorrow

00:04:42.521 --> 00:04:44.892
so he decided to meet her
at the stroke of midnight

00:04:44.992 --> 00:04:45.994
so he could be the first one

00:04:46.094 --> 00:04:47.564
to wish her a happy birthday.

00:04:47.664 --> 00:04:49.902
He sure is an nice guy, huh?

00:04:50.002 --> 00:04:50.837
(Shoji sneezes)

00:04:50.937 --> 00:04:52.306
- So nice it makes me sick.

00:04:52.406 --> 00:04:55.112
I guess they're already
lovey-dovey behind our backs,
huh?

00:04:55.212 --> 00:04:56.381
- Anyway. Good for him.

00:04:56.481 --> 00:04:59.020
This is how things should
be, for Sachiko's sake.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.389
(door bell clangs)

00:05:00.489 --> 00:05:02.661
- [Nobo] Hi! Please, have a
seat.

00:05:02.761 --> 00:05:06.267
- (sighs) We should be
more worried about Nana.

00:05:06.367 --> 00:05:08.138
After the way you lectured her,

00:05:08.238 --> 00:05:10.442
we'll be lucky if she's still
alive.

00:05:10.543 --> 00:05:11.377
- She'll be fine.

00:05:11.478 --> 00:05:13.014
Tomorrow night's her roommate's
show

00:05:13.114 --> 00:05:13.749
and she's so psyched about it.

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.154
She's not gonna do anything
drastic before then.

00:05:16.254 --> 00:05:18.458
By the way, I promised we'd
go to the show with her.

00:05:18.559 --> 00:05:21.632
- Yeah, but what if she kills
herself after the concert?

00:05:21.732 --> 00:05:24.738
- [Angel Nana K.] Farewell!
(giggles)

00:05:26.575 --> 00:05:30.048
- [Kyosuke] I guess that would
mean the end of the show.

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:33.221
- And then I got so emotional

00:05:33.321 --> 00:05:35.092
I just started crying.

00:05:35.192 --> 00:05:38.498
'Cause I got front row seats
at the Trapnest concert!

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:40.202
I can't believe I'm
gonna get to see Takumi

00:05:40.302 --> 00:05:41.471
up close in person!

00:05:41.572 --> 00:05:43.576
I'm so happy I could just die!
(giggles)

00:05:43.676 --> 00:05:45.279
- Farewell!

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:46.181
- Oh!

00:05:46.281 --> 00:05:47.082
Hold on a minute.

00:05:47.183 --> 00:05:48.753
If I died, I wouldn't
get to see him.

00:05:48.853 --> 00:05:50.255
So there's no way I can die yet.

00:05:50.355 --> 00:05:52.159
- [Junko And Kyosuke] Thank God
for that.

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:53.996
- Hey Jun, if Nana can't go,

00:05:54.096 --> 00:05:56.000
do you wanna come to the concert
with me?

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.936
- Not really.

00:05:57.036 --> 00:05:58.104
I know you got some great seats

00:05:58.205 --> 00:05:59.875
but I'm not a big Trapnest fan.

00:05:59.975 --> 00:06:01.244
I wouldn't enjoy it.

00:06:01.344 --> 00:06:02.647
- Oh, come on, go with her.

00:06:02.747 --> 00:06:04.250
It's only a concert.

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:06.120
- You guys are no fun.

00:06:06.221 --> 00:06:08.626
Hmph. That's the same reaction
Nana had.

00:06:08.726 --> 00:06:11.231
She's like, "I'll only
go if I feel like it."

00:06:11.331 --> 00:06:12.399
And when she found out where the
gig was,

00:06:12.499 --> 00:06:14.237
she said it wasn't worth going
that far.

00:06:14.337 --> 00:06:15.138
- [Junko] How far?

00:06:15.239 --> 00:06:16.074
Where is it?

00:06:16.174 --> 00:06:17.744
- It's at Idea Hall.

00:06:17.844 --> 00:06:18.345
- Idea Hall?

00:06:18.445 --> 00:06:21.017
You mean as in the Idea Hall
back home?

00:06:21.117 --> 00:06:21.819
- Mm-hm.

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:22.888
- You're kidding me.

00:06:22.988 --> 00:06:23.990
Why didn't you just buy tickets

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:25.259
for when they're playing in
Tokyo?

00:06:25.359 --> 00:06:26.695
- Because I bought the
tickets so long ago,

00:06:26.795 --> 00:06:29.835
I didn't know for sure if
I was gonna be in Tokyo.

00:06:29.935 --> 00:06:31.237
And Trapnest is so huge in Tokyo

00:06:31.337 --> 00:06:32.874
that even the fan club members
have

00:06:32.974 --> 00:06:34.544
to win a lottery to get tickets.

00:06:34.645 --> 00:06:36.916
I'd be crushed if I couldn't see
them.

00:06:37.016 --> 00:06:37.884
But with the show back home,

00:06:37.984 --> 00:06:40.489
I knew I could get two tickets
right next to each other.

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:42.159
And I figured I'd see them
better

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:42.894
than in a big arena in Tokyo.

00:06:42.994 --> 00:06:45.032
- Well then you can count me
out.

00:06:45.132 --> 00:06:46.034
It's not worth it.

00:06:46.134 --> 00:06:46.467
- Well, why not?

00:06:46.569 --> 00:06:49.373
It'd be a good excuse to
go home for a nice visit.

00:06:49.473 --> 00:06:51.512
- What makes you think I
wanna go home for a visit?

00:06:51.612 --> 00:06:53.816
If I do that, my folks will
just make me work on the farm.

00:06:53.916 --> 00:06:55.118
(Kyosuke laughs)

00:06:55.218 --> 00:06:55.987
- Well, okay, fine.

00:06:56.087 --> 00:06:58.893
I'll ask Nana again and see
if she's changed her mind.

00:06:58.993 --> 00:06:59.561
She talks tough,

00:06:59.661 --> 00:07:01.464
but she can be really
sweet when she wants to be.

00:07:01.565 --> 00:07:03.803
I bet I can get her to go with
me.

00:07:03.903 --> 00:07:04.605
- I wouldn't be so sure.

00:07:04.705 --> 00:07:06.207
Especially not if you're
putting pressure on her.

00:07:06.307 --> 00:07:07.209
She won't like that.

00:07:07.309 --> 00:07:08.713
Why don't you try and find some
guy who's

00:07:08.813 --> 00:07:11.484
as big a Trapnest as fan
as you are and go with him?

00:07:11.585 --> 00:07:12.587
- [Kyosuke] Yeah. Great idea.

00:07:12.687 --> 00:07:14.457
That way you can get
yourself a new boyfriend

00:07:14.558 --> 00:07:16.394
and go to the concert at the
same time.

00:07:16.494 --> 00:07:18.031
Kill two birds with one stone.

00:07:18.131 --> 00:07:20.870
- No. I don't want a boyfriend.

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:22.841
I'm never falling in love again.

00:07:25.045 --> 00:07:26.548
- Huh?
- Huh?

00:07:28.451 --> 00:07:30.455
- What are we gonna do with her?

00:07:30.556 --> 00:07:34.330
- You take falling in love
away from Nana, what's left?

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:36.067
(car engine revving)

00:07:36.167 --> 00:07:38.606
(sad piano music)

00:07:38.706 --> 00:07:41.044
- Anyway, I have Nana.

00:07:41.144 --> 00:07:43.481
When I'm with her, I never feel
lonely.

00:07:43.582 --> 00:07:45.787
We're both girls so we
can totally be ourselves

00:07:45.887 --> 00:07:49.193
around each other and we
don't get all jealous.

00:07:49.293 --> 00:07:50.228
We always have each other

00:07:50.329 --> 00:07:53.602
and it just feels so
comfortable.

00:07:57.443 --> 00:08:00.148
Compared to that, love is
exhausting

00:08:00.248 --> 00:08:02.921
and painful and it never lasts.

00:08:03.021 --> 00:08:04.490
I've had enough of it.

00:08:04.591 --> 00:08:06.094
I don't want a boyfriend.

00:08:06.194 --> 00:08:10.636
What I want is a knight in
shining armor to protect me.

00:08:10.737 --> 00:08:12.841
Of course, I know a guy like
that

00:08:12.941 --> 00:08:14.778
doesn't exist in the real world.

00:08:16.882 --> 00:08:20.022
(punk music suddenly plays)

00:08:20.122 --> 00:08:22.192
(audience cheering)

00:08:22.292 --> 00:08:23.061
- It's so loud!
- It's so loud!

00:08:23.161 --> 00:08:24.598
- This place is packed!

00:08:24.698 --> 00:08:26.635
And I wanted to be right up at
the front.

00:08:26.735 --> 00:08:29.140
We should have gotten here
a lot earlier, you guys!

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:31.578
- What kinda show is this?

00:08:32.346 --> 00:08:33.783
Oh, it's punk night.

00:08:33.883 --> 00:08:35.687
- Is it all hardcore punk?

00:08:35.787 --> 00:08:37.356
- Man, it's gonna be a long
night.

00:08:37.456 --> 00:08:38.959
- I think Nana's band is up
next.

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:42.332
We gotta see if we can push
our way up front, come on guys!

00:08:42.433 --> 00:08:44.504
- Hey Nana, you want
me to get you a drink?

00:08:44.604 --> 00:08:46.975
- No thanks! I'd just spill it.

00:08:47.076 --> 00:08:50.449
(audience cheering)

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:53.689
(Nana K. exclaims)

00:08:53.789 --> 00:08:57.029
How am I going to get to the
front?

00:08:57.129 --> 00:08:58.699
What's with this music?

00:08:58.799 --> 00:09:00.737
I can't get into it.

00:09:02.206 --> 00:09:03.909
That guy was awful.

00:09:04.009 --> 00:09:05.379
- Thank you, good night!

00:09:05.479 --> 00:09:08.953
- Plus he needs to lose a few
pounds.

00:09:10.489 --> 00:09:12.192
Huh? Are they done?

00:09:12.292 --> 00:09:13.061
Nana's next!

00:09:13.161 --> 00:09:14.798
This is my chance to get up
close.

00:09:14.898 --> 00:09:17.269
- [Concertgoer] Hey, should
we stay for the next band?

00:09:17.369 --> 00:09:18.338
- [Concertgoer 2] Black Stones?

00:09:18.438 --> 00:09:19.440
Never heard of 'em.

00:09:19.541 --> 00:09:21.244
- They shorten it to Blast.

00:09:21.344 --> 00:09:22.112
How lame is that?

00:09:22.212 --> 00:09:23.516
- It is not lame!

00:09:23.616 --> 00:09:24.918
- [Concertgoer] Let's go grab a
smoke.

00:09:25.018 --> 00:09:26.655
- [Concertgoer 3] We've
heard all the good bands now.

00:09:26.755 --> 00:09:28.526
- [Concertgoer 4] Yeah.
Let's get our drink on.

00:09:28.626 --> 00:09:29.193
- What?

00:09:29.293 --> 00:09:30.462
Where are they going?

00:09:30.563 --> 00:09:33.268
Wait everyone, come back!

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:36.909
You know what?

00:09:37.009 --> 00:09:37.644
This next band is like

00:09:37.744 --> 00:09:39.648
the best band ever in the whole
world.

00:09:39.748 --> 00:09:40.817
Huh?

00:09:50.168 --> 00:09:52.172
What a cute girl.

00:09:52.272 --> 00:09:52.907
- Oh, yeah, I agree with you.

00:09:53.007 --> 00:09:56.414
Blast are so cool,
they totally rule.

00:09:57.249 --> 00:09:58.552
- [Nana K.] Wow. She's hyper.

00:09:58.652 --> 00:10:00.690
- And their lead singer Nana is
amazing.

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:02.894
Her voice is so strong
and powerful.

00:10:02.994 --> 00:10:04.163
- Huh?

00:10:04.263 --> 00:10:06.100
- The next band's gonna
be all girls?

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:06.902
- Well, no.

00:10:07.002 --> 00:10:09.173
The only girl in the
band is the lead singer,

00:10:09.273 --> 00:10:11.177
but the drummer and
the guitar player rock.

00:10:11.277 --> 00:10:12.312
They play like pros.

00:10:12.412 --> 00:10:13.649
This is their first show in
Tokyo,

00:10:13.749 --> 00:10:15.218
but they're really big back
home.

00:10:15.318 --> 00:10:16.087
They're awesome.

00:10:16.187 --> 00:10:17.757
- Well, you wanna check 'em out?

00:10:17.857 --> 00:10:18.726
- Sure. Why not?

00:10:18.826 --> 00:10:21.865
- Those curls you've got
are real cute, Goldilocks.

00:10:21.965 --> 00:10:22.534
Are they fake?

00:10:22.634 --> 00:10:24.336
- No, this is all my own hair.

00:10:24.436 --> 00:10:25.640
- [Nana K.] Who is this girl?

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:27.777
- Hey, I hear the next band's
pretty good.

00:10:27.877 --> 00:10:28.612
We should stick around.

00:10:28.712 --> 00:10:29.781
- Yeah, okay, if you want.

00:10:29.881 --> 00:10:31.752
- [Concertgoer] At least
for the first couple songs.

00:10:31.852 --> 00:10:33.388
- The next band's supposed to be
amazing.

00:10:33.488 --> 00:10:34.858
I think we should stay for a
while.

00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:38.331
- Really? If they're gonna
be good, we might as well.

00:10:38.431 --> 00:10:38.899
- Are they that good?

00:10:38.999 --> 00:10:41.270
- I don't know, but
we're gonna find out.

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:43.742
If they suck, there's gonna be
trouble.

00:10:45.011 --> 00:10:46.414
- [Nana K.] Wow, the crowd.

00:10:46.515 --> 00:10:48.117
They all came back.

00:10:48.218 --> 00:10:51.592
(crowd chattering)

00:10:52.861 --> 00:10:53.529
Excuse me.

00:10:53.629 --> 00:10:55.031
- Oh my God, they're on!

00:10:58.404 --> 00:11:01.477
(Nana K. gasps)

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:05.085
- [Nana K.] Oh, man.

00:11:05.185 --> 00:11:06.120
What's going on?

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:08.091
I'm actually getting nervous.

00:11:09.393 --> 00:11:11.832
It feels like my heart's gonna
explode.

00:11:11.932 --> 00:11:15.405
(instruments tuning)

00:11:16.374 --> 00:11:18.111
- Hey, look at those guys up
there.

00:11:18.211 --> 00:11:19.748
They're pretty hot, don't you
think?

00:11:19.848 --> 00:11:22.152
- Yeah, but what really
matters is how they play.

00:11:22.252 --> 00:11:23.121
Not what they look like.

00:11:23.221 --> 00:11:25.091
I mean, can they rock the house?

00:11:29.868 --> 00:11:31.572
(rock music)

00:11:31.672 --> 00:11:35.045
(audience gasping)

00:11:38.051 --> 00:11:39.386
- Huh? What's going on?

00:11:39.486 --> 00:11:41.725
The floor, it's shaking.

00:11:42.694 --> 00:11:45.766
(audience screaming)

00:11:45.867 --> 00:11:46.869
- Nana!

00:12:00.262 --> 00:12:04.103
("rose" by Anna Tsuchiya)

00:12:07.577 --> 00:12:08.478
- Hello Tokyo.

00:12:08.579 --> 00:12:10.148
Are you ready for Blast?

00:12:12.119 --> 00:12:14.490
- [Nobu's Voice] She was
pretty well known back at home.

00:12:14.591 --> 00:12:16.795
Lots of crazy fans and stuff.

00:12:36.768 --> 00:12:38.338
- [Nana K.] She was
singing about the struggle

00:12:38.438 --> 00:12:40.710
to get up and stand tall.

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:43.014
Even when life has
abandoned you.

00:12:45.185 --> 00:12:47.489
Only Nana sings songs like that.

00:12:53.969 --> 00:12:55.105
I'm gonna cry.

00:12:57.142 --> 00:12:58.946
That's what I'm feeling.

00:13:01.685 --> 00:13:03.989
Don't abandon me, Nana.

00:13:06.227 --> 00:13:07.930
- Seriously, I was blown away.

00:13:08.031 --> 00:13:11.203
You guys really showed a lot
of talent out there tonight.

00:13:11.304 --> 00:13:12.439
I mean your performance
made all the

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:13.809
other bands look like amateurs.

00:13:13.909 --> 00:13:15.145
- Yeah, you sounded so...

00:13:15.245 --> 00:13:16.013
How can I put it?

00:13:16.113 --> 00:13:18.151
There's something raw and
real about your energy

00:13:18.251 --> 00:13:19.320
when you're on stage.

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:20.656
Anyway, you guys rocked tonight.

00:13:20.756 --> 00:13:23.161
- Thanks Mr. Kyosuke
and Ms. Junko.

00:13:23.261 --> 00:13:24.430
- Don't gimme that "Mr." crap,

00:13:24.531 --> 00:13:25.566
we're the same age as you.

00:13:25.666 --> 00:13:27.169
Just use our first names.

00:13:27.269 --> 00:13:28.505
- Really? Are you serious?

00:13:28.605 --> 00:13:29.373
You guys are so mature.

00:13:29.473 --> 00:13:31.410
I thought you were
the same age as Yasu.

00:13:31.511 --> 00:13:33.147
- Maybe Nobu should stop
acting like a child.

00:13:33.247 --> 00:13:35.720
- He looks cool until he
opens that big mouth of his.

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:37.322
Good thing you guys
made sure he kept

00:13:37.422 --> 00:13:39.059
it shut when he was on stage.

00:13:39.159 --> 00:13:39.961
(Yasu laughs)

00:13:40.061 --> 00:13:41.230
- Uh, Ms. Komatsu.

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:44.036
Do you have any plates we
could use to serve this on?

00:13:44.136 --> 00:13:45.806
- [Nana K.] No, we don't have
enough.

00:13:45.906 --> 00:13:47.810
You can just put it out like
that.

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:48.044
- Okay.

00:13:48.144 --> 00:13:49.581
- Misato!
(Misato exclaims)

00:13:49.681 --> 00:13:50.649
- Huh?
- [Nana] What'd you make?

00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:52.352
- [Misato] Oh, just a salad.
(giggles)

00:13:52.452 --> 00:13:55.291
I figured you'd want something
light to eat after the show.

00:13:55.392 --> 00:13:56.060
- [Nana] Mm, yum.

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:59.333
You're a girl after my own
heart.

00:13:59.433 --> 00:14:00.770
Let's go sit down with everyone
else

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:02.507
and let Hachi do the rest.
- Yeah, but...

00:14:02.607 --> 00:14:03.876
- [Nana] It's fine, it's fine.

00:14:03.976 --> 00:14:05.378
Okay, we don't have enough seats

00:14:05.478 --> 00:14:07.349
so move it, Nobu.
- Yes ma'am.

00:14:07.449 --> 00:14:08.484
- [Nana K.] Where am I gonna
sit?

00:14:08.585 --> 00:14:09.888
- You came all the way to Tokyo

00:14:09.988 --> 00:14:12.025
just so you could see these guys
perform?

00:14:12.125 --> 00:14:12.527
- [Misato] Yeah.

00:14:12.627 --> 00:14:14.496
- You look so cute in that
apron, Misato.

00:14:14.597 --> 00:14:16.635
- [Nana K.] Which happens to be
my apron.

00:14:16.735 --> 00:14:17.637
- Impressive, guys.

00:14:17.737 --> 00:14:18.471
You've already got yourselves

00:14:18.572 --> 00:14:19.908
a fan club with
the number one fan.

00:14:20.008 --> 00:14:22.312
- I'm surprised you even
found out about the show.

00:14:22.412 --> 00:14:25.418
We were just filling in 'cause
one of the bands canceled.

00:14:25.519 --> 00:14:27.322
- I got a call from Nana
and she told me.

00:14:27.422 --> 00:14:28.726
(Nana K. gasps)
- [Nobu] She did?

00:14:28.826 --> 00:14:30.529
- [Nana] I just let her
know about the show.

00:14:30.629 --> 00:14:33.434
I never actually
expected her to come.

00:14:33.535 --> 00:14:35.271
- Is it a problem that I'm here?

00:14:35.372 --> 00:14:36.641
- Now why would you think that?

00:14:36.742 --> 00:14:38.444
I'm glad you're here.

00:14:38.545 --> 00:14:40.048
Come on, sit down.

00:14:40.148 --> 00:14:40.750
- [Misato] Thanks!

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:42.954
- [Nana K.] (mockingly) Is
it a problem that I'm here?

00:14:43.054 --> 00:14:44.858
Whatever.

00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:47.663
- Does she have a thing for
Nana?

00:14:48.532 --> 00:14:51.470
She was crying at the show.

00:14:51.571 --> 00:14:53.709
But those two girls together?

00:14:54.243 --> 00:14:55.044
Weird.

00:14:55.145 --> 00:14:57.750
(sad music)

00:14:57.850 --> 00:14:58.752
- I love all those blonde curls
of yours.

00:14:58.852 --> 00:15:00.790
- [Nana K.] Why am I feeling so
jealous?

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:01.691
- [Misato] Really?

00:15:01.792 --> 00:15:03.529
- I wish I had hair like that.
(laughs)

00:15:03.629 --> 00:15:06.133
- [Nana K.] Maybe I'm the one
who's weird.

00:15:06.233 --> 00:15:08.071
- Can you imagine?

00:15:08.171 --> 00:15:09.273
- All right, you guys.

00:15:09.373 --> 00:15:10.208
We'll be seein' ya.

00:15:10.308 --> 00:15:11.410
- Thanks for a great show.

00:15:11.511 --> 00:15:12.179
Good luck with the band.

00:15:12.279 --> 00:15:13.982
- [Yasu] Yo, Nobu, get up.

00:15:14.083 --> 00:15:14.551
We're going too.

00:15:14.651 --> 00:15:16.487
- No, I can't go anywhere.

00:15:16.588 --> 00:15:17.489
I don't feel good.

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:20.095
Nobu's a total lightweight
when it comes to drinking.

00:15:20.195 --> 00:15:22.399
- More like you're a
heavyweight.

00:15:22.499 --> 00:15:23.034
- Hey, Nana.

00:15:23.134 --> 00:15:25.438
We should let Nobu crash
here for the night.

00:15:25.539 --> 00:15:26.508
- Yeah, that's fine.

00:15:26.608 --> 00:15:27.442
Whatever.

00:15:27.543 --> 00:15:28.478
- [Misato] Uh.
- [Nana K.] Hm?

00:15:28.579 --> 00:15:30.115
- I think I'm gonna head out.

00:15:30.215 --> 00:15:32.152
- [Nana] What? Where are you
going?

00:15:32.252 --> 00:15:34.557
- I made a reservation
for a room in a hotel

00:15:34.657 --> 00:15:36.093
that's close to Tokyo station.

00:15:36.193 --> 00:15:38.632
- Oh yeah? Why don't I
take you there in a cab?

00:15:38.732 --> 00:15:39.266
- [Nana K.] Good.

00:15:39.366 --> 00:15:41.003
I thought she was gonna
end up crashing here too.

00:15:41.103 --> 00:15:43.474
- Cancel the hotel room,
you can stay with us.

00:15:43.575 --> 00:15:45.311
(Nana K. gasps)
- [Yasu] Makes sense.

00:15:45.411 --> 00:15:46.280
I mean you're already here.

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:47.583
- No, no, that's all right.

00:15:47.683 --> 00:15:48.417
I couldn't.

00:15:48.519 --> 00:15:49.453
- Really, it's no problem.

00:15:49.554 --> 00:15:50.856
Nobu, change of plans.

00:15:50.956 --> 00:15:52.159
You're not staying here tonight.

00:15:52.259 --> 00:15:54.329
Misato wouldn't be safe
around you.

00:15:54.429 --> 00:15:55.365
- Ah, no fair.

00:15:55.465 --> 00:15:58.906
- [Shinichi] Sweet, now I get
to crash at your place, Nobu.

00:16:01.711 --> 00:16:03.715
- I can't sleep.

00:16:03.816 --> 00:16:05.753
I know Nana's not into girls,

00:16:05.853 --> 00:16:07.757
but what if Misato is?

00:16:07.857 --> 00:16:10.228
What if she forces
herself on Nana?

00:16:10.328 --> 00:16:13.735
What if they get carried
away and something happens?

00:16:14.571 --> 00:16:16.508
Nana's really drunk.

00:16:16.608 --> 00:16:19.012
She'd never be that nice
if she wasn't.

00:16:20.549 --> 00:16:22.620
Two girls doing it.

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:23.589
How does that work?

00:16:23.689 --> 00:16:26.393
I guess Nana would be on top.

00:16:27.395 --> 00:16:27.763
(Nana K. gasps)

00:16:27.864 --> 00:16:31.470
What am I doing, fantasizing
about my roommate?

00:16:31.571 --> 00:16:33.675
I gotta get a boyfriend.

00:16:34.343 --> 00:16:36.213
I need to get laid.

00:16:36.313 --> 00:16:38.050
And it needs to be soon!

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:41.658
That's why I'm getting
all these freaky feelings.

00:16:41.758 --> 00:16:43.562
What I really need is a nice guy

00:16:43.662 --> 00:16:45.799
who'll take good care of me.

00:16:48.271 --> 00:16:50.843
But hunting for guys is such a
drag.

00:16:50.943 --> 00:16:53.982
And all that romance is
a waste of time.

00:16:54.082 --> 00:16:56.821
When I fall in love, I get too
involved.

00:16:56.922 --> 00:16:59.994
I act crazy and put all my
energy into it.

00:17:00.094 --> 00:17:01.163
I forget everything else.

00:17:01.263 --> 00:17:04.436
And maybe that's why it doesn't
work out.

00:17:04.537 --> 00:17:06.240
It was like that with Takashi.

00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:09.814
(sighs) I can hardly even
remember his face anymore,

00:17:09.914 --> 00:17:12.219
but I thought I was in love with
him.

00:17:12.787 --> 00:17:14.691
Same with Shoji.

00:17:14.791 --> 00:17:17.429
I don't wanna think about
Shoji now.

00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:19.801
I don't wanna remember.

00:17:19.901 --> 00:17:22.940
I have to just think
about tomorrow.

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:24.878
I wish I didn't have the
day off work.

00:17:24.978 --> 00:17:27.683
'Cause that would help me
take my mind off things.

00:17:27.783 --> 00:17:29.119
Then again, when I do go back

00:17:29.219 --> 00:17:31.490
I know Ms. Sakagami is gonna
make me feel

00:17:31.591 --> 00:17:33.361
like a loser all day long.

00:17:33.461 --> 00:17:36.166
Do I really wanna put myself
through that?

00:17:36.267 --> 00:17:39.974
I should look for a new job
so I can get outta there.

00:17:40.074 --> 00:17:43.047
That place is way too
uptight for me.

00:17:43.147 --> 00:17:46.253
Will there ever be a
place where I can fit in?

00:17:46.353 --> 00:17:49.794
(sad music box tune)

00:17:50.663 --> 00:17:52.800
I'm jealous of Nana.

00:17:58.779 --> 00:18:01.851
(bright music)

00:18:03.354 --> 00:18:04.423
Hmph.

00:18:05.626 --> 00:18:06.528
Why didn't she invite me too?

00:18:06.628 --> 00:18:10.068
I would've loved to have
gone to the amusement park.

00:18:11.236 --> 00:18:12.707
In that case, I'm going out.

00:18:12.807 --> 00:18:15.078
Yeah, I'm going shopping.

00:18:15.178 --> 00:18:16.915
I'm gonna buy clothes, makeup,

00:18:17.015 --> 00:18:20.254
a total shopping spree, whatever
I want.

00:18:20.355 --> 00:18:21.725
But there's one problem.

00:18:21.825 --> 00:18:23.261
I'm broke.

00:18:23.361 --> 00:18:25.231
I put that 300,000 yen from my
mom

00:18:25.331 --> 00:18:27.503
into a long-term deposit.
- Hi, can I help you?

00:18:27.603 --> 00:18:28.170
- Now I can't get at it

00:18:28.271 --> 00:18:29.574
and the interest rate sucks.
- Good color for you!

00:18:29.674 --> 00:18:32.747
- I don't care about that big
house with a yard anymore.

00:18:32.847 --> 00:18:34.517
- Is there something wrong?

00:18:36.253 --> 00:18:38.525
Why are there so many
couples all over the place?

00:18:38.625 --> 00:18:39.894
Is no one single anymore?

00:18:39.994 --> 00:18:41.263
(couple giggling)

00:18:41.363 --> 00:18:43.100
(Nana K. exclaims)

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:44.637
That's it, I'm going home.

00:18:44.737 --> 00:18:47.309
(ringing)

00:18:48.779 --> 00:18:50.916
7 o'clock already?

00:18:51.016 --> 00:18:52.987
What a waste of a day.

00:18:53.522 --> 00:18:54.691
Now I'm hungry.

00:18:54.791 --> 00:18:56.661
What should I do for dinner?

00:18:56.761 --> 00:18:59.099
I know, I'll go to Jackson's!

00:18:59.199 --> 00:19:00.268
I always know people there

00:19:00.368 --> 00:19:02.907
so I won't feel like I'm on my
own.

00:19:04.476 --> 00:19:05.546
Then again,

00:19:05.646 --> 00:19:07.783
that's where Shoji hangs out.

00:19:08.752 --> 00:19:09.721
Forget it.

00:19:09.821 --> 00:19:10.823
I'll just get some groceries

00:19:10.923 --> 00:19:12.192
and make something at home.

00:19:12.292 --> 00:19:15.031
Gotta save money, gotta save
money.

00:19:15.131 --> 00:19:16.534
Misato's still in high school

00:19:16.634 --> 00:19:18.070
so she's got class tomorrow.

00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:20.308
She must be getting the train
home by now.

00:19:20.408 --> 00:19:23.214
Which means Nana will
probably be home soon.

00:19:30.161 --> 00:19:32.533
Huh, the ground beefs on sale.

00:19:32.633 --> 00:19:33.969
Hamburgers tonight.

00:19:34.704 --> 00:19:38.110
(suspenseful music)

00:19:38.812 --> 00:19:42.419
(Nana K. gasps lightly)

00:19:45.358 --> 00:19:47.663
Why did I have to run into her
here?

00:19:47.763 --> 00:19:49.967
She doesn't live nearby, does
she?

00:19:51.403 --> 00:19:52.840
Or maybe

00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:55.445
she's gonna cook something for
Shoji

00:19:56.548 --> 00:19:58.017
at his place.

00:19:59.687 --> 00:20:02.593
(Nana K. crying)

00:20:05.733 --> 00:20:07.536
- Oh, hi Hachi, you're home.

00:20:07.636 --> 00:20:08.805
So where you been?

00:20:08.905 --> 00:20:09.774
- Welcome back.

00:20:09.874 --> 00:20:11.043
You've got great timing.

00:20:11.143 --> 00:20:11.811
I made dinner for us all

00:20:11.911 --> 00:20:13.949
and it's just about ready.

00:20:14.049 --> 00:20:14.784
- Look at her.

00:20:14.884 --> 00:20:16.186
Doesn't Misato look super cute
in this?

00:20:16.286 --> 00:20:19.159
- Nana decided to buy it for me.

00:20:20.495 --> 00:20:21.531
- [Nana] What?

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:24.136
- Huh?

00:20:25.539 --> 00:20:28.310
(violin music)

00:20:28.411 --> 00:20:30.381
- [Nana K.] I don't wanna lose
Nana too.

00:20:30.481 --> 00:20:31.785
- Hachi.

00:20:31.885 --> 00:20:36.026
- [Nana K.] Everyone I love
is being taken away from me.

00:20:36.126 --> 00:20:38.565
So is this girl gonna be
staying with us tonight as well?

00:20:38.665 --> 00:20:40.569
In case you forgot, I
live here too, you know.

00:20:40.669 --> 00:20:43.708
You can't just do whatever you
want, Nana!

00:20:43.809 --> 00:20:46.548
(Nana gasps)

00:20:47.716 --> 00:20:50.354
(Nana sighs)

00:20:50.455 --> 00:20:54.897
I thought Nana was going
to be really mad at me

00:20:54.997 --> 00:20:56.133
but she looked like a child

00:20:56.233 --> 00:20:58.037
who'd just been scolded.

00:21:00.374 --> 00:21:03.949
It breaks my heart to think
about it.

00:21:04.049 --> 00:21:07.055
If only I'd been more mature
back then.

00:21:07.155 --> 00:21:10.629
If only I realized what
your weaknesses were.

00:21:11.798 --> 00:21:15.906
Would things have been
different now?
