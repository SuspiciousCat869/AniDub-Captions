WEBVTT

00:00:02.313 --> 00:00:03.916
- Hey, Nana Komatsu.

00:00:04.016 --> 00:00:05.753
Remember all those times at
school

00:00:05.853 --> 00:00:07.524
when we'd hang out in
the girls' bathroom?

00:00:07.624 --> 00:00:11.064
And you'd tell me every little
detail about your love life.

00:00:11.164 --> 00:00:14.403
Well, I don't want to
hear about it anymore.

00:00:14.504 --> 00:00:17.009
(fast intro music playing)

00:01:54.705 --> 00:01:55.405
- Hi everyone.

00:01:55.506 --> 00:01:58.078
Welcome to another night at
Junko's place.

00:01:58.178 --> 00:01:58.979
- Ah, thanks for dropping by.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.817
Long time no see.

00:02:00.917 --> 00:02:01.785
Hey, how come this place

00:02:01.885 --> 00:02:03.221
never seems to have any
customers?

00:02:03.321 --> 00:02:04.490
- They'll come. They'll come.

00:02:04.591 --> 00:02:05.058
Like tonight,

00:02:05.158 --> 00:02:07.029
I'm sure we're going to
see Shin, Nobu, and Yasu.

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:09.601
And maybe even someone
from Trapnest will show up.

00:02:09.701 --> 00:02:10.803
- What the hell's that about?

00:02:10.903 --> 00:02:12.507
The demon lord tell you?

00:02:13.208 --> 00:02:14.110
Oh, wow. A customer

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.447
- Come in. Welcome.

00:02:16.548 --> 00:02:18.686
- Congratulations on
opening your own place.

00:02:18.786 --> 00:02:21.658
- What the hell's going on?
Why is Koichi Sato here?

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:23.028
- Word is he's got some serious
fans

00:02:23.128 --> 00:02:24.798
out there who actually
like him.

00:02:24.898 --> 00:02:26.902
Of course. They've all
gotta be real maniacs.

00:02:27.002 --> 00:02:28.471
- They're not maniacs.

00:02:28.572 --> 00:02:31.177
Hey, you guys know how
Nana's been doing lately?

00:02:31.277 --> 00:02:34.116
- When you say Nana,
you mean Nana Komatsu?

00:02:34.216 --> 00:02:36.220
- I haven't seen her around
at Jackson's recently

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.791
which means I haven't
been appearing

00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:39.326
in the series as much as I want.

00:02:39.427 --> 00:02:43.869
So did something weird happen
between her and Shoji?

00:02:46.875 --> 00:02:48.746
- Shoji you're the worst.

00:02:48.846 --> 00:02:50.215
I can't believe you would do
that.

00:02:50.315 --> 00:02:52.754
- Well, I just sort of
forgot to mention it

00:02:52.854 --> 00:02:53.756
and she never asked.

00:02:53.856 --> 00:02:55.158
I wasn't hiding anything
from her.

00:02:55.258 --> 00:02:56.695
- Don't want any excuses.

00:02:56.795 --> 00:02:58.064
You hid the fact you had
a girlfriend,

00:02:58.164 --> 00:02:59.233
so you could hit on this
other girl.

00:02:59.333 --> 00:03:01.137
- Junko, you know I'm
not capable of doing

00:03:01.237 --> 00:03:02.540
something sneaky like that.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:03.341
- Not on purpose, no.

00:03:03.441 --> 00:03:05.980
But you're not thinking
you're completely clueless.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.584
Something like this has
the potential

00:03:07.684 --> 00:03:09.019
to break a young girl's heart.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.157
- You really think I
hurt her? I don't know.

00:03:11.257 --> 00:03:13.228
- Come on. Of course
you hurt her.

00:03:13.328 --> 00:03:15.465
Sachiko's fallen in love
with you, right?

00:03:15.566 --> 00:03:16.100
- I think so.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.837
But maybe that's just me
thinking she loves me.

00:03:17.937 --> 00:03:20.543
She never actually said that
she likes me or anything.

00:03:20.643 --> 00:03:22.479
And nothing has ever
happened between us.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.150
When we were hanging out,
it was just as friends.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.922
- Sometimes I wonder if your
intellectual capabilities

00:03:27.022 --> 00:03:28.859
ever got beyond junior high.

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.164
- Junko, don't just walk
away from me.

00:03:31.264 --> 00:03:32.967
I need your advice.

00:03:33.067 --> 00:03:34.838
What should I say to her?

00:03:34.938 --> 00:03:37.777
- You want my advice? Stop
seeing her.

00:03:37.877 --> 00:03:41.518
(ice clanks)

00:03:41.618 --> 00:03:44.591
- So Sachiko is more important
to you than Nana now?

00:03:44.691 --> 00:03:45.358
- No way.

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.198
Koichi Sato, I'm going to
work now.

00:03:48.298 --> 00:03:50.503
I got to put an end to
this relationship right away.

00:03:50.603 --> 00:03:53.742
I'm going to make sure I
lie the same grave as Nana.

00:03:53.843 --> 00:03:59.621
(tie grips)
(solemn music)

00:03:59.721 --> 00:04:01.792
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
Let's go.

00:04:01.892 --> 00:04:03.228
- Sachiko, wait.

00:04:04.497 --> 00:04:07.202
There's something I need
to tell you.

00:04:07.302 --> 00:04:08.338
- Huh?

00:04:09.875 --> 00:04:13.014
(loud footsteps)

00:04:20.863 --> 00:04:21.665
- You know.

00:04:21.765 --> 00:04:24.604
(Sachiko sobs)

00:04:34.758 --> 00:04:37.129
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:38.699
- It's not your fault Shoji.

00:04:38.799 --> 00:04:40.970
I'm the one to blame.

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.074
It was me. I got my hopes up.

00:04:43.174 --> 00:04:45.145
That's all.

00:04:45.245 --> 00:04:50.188
I did it on purpose but
I'll try not to interfere.

00:04:50.288 --> 00:04:52.527
I won't ever get in the
way of your relationship

00:04:52.627 --> 00:04:53.494
with your girlfriend.

00:04:53.596 --> 00:04:54.998
I promise.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.006
So, please Shoji.

00:04:59.106 --> 00:05:02.479
Why can't we just be friends?

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.553
I don't want you to start
avoiding me.

00:05:06.187 --> 00:05:09.728
(both cries)

00:05:09.828 --> 00:05:13.736
(slow piano music playing)

00:05:14.804 --> 00:05:16.975
- There's no answer. Weird.

00:05:17.075 --> 00:05:18.712
Shoji should have finished work
by now

00:05:18.812 --> 00:05:20.616
but it's going to voicemail.

00:05:20.716 --> 00:05:22.386
Maybe his phone's dead.

00:05:22.486 --> 00:05:23.923
- What if he's cheating on you?

00:05:24.023 --> 00:05:25.860
- He wouldn't cheat on
me. He's not like that.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.730
I'll just text him instead.

00:05:33.742 --> 00:05:35.078
- You know?

00:05:35.178 --> 00:05:36.648
I don't think there's anything
we can do

00:05:36.748 --> 00:05:38.619
to fix what Shoji's done.

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:40.455
For as long as I've
known him he's never been

00:05:40.556 --> 00:05:42.694
the kind of guy to cheat on a
girlfriend.

00:05:42.794 --> 00:05:44.163
Not even to think about
it.

00:05:44.263 --> 00:05:47.069
- No, that's impossible.
He couldn't do it.

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:47.670
- I know.

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.408
That's what makes me wonder
if this is the real thing.

00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:52.647
He might have fallen so
much in love with Sachiko,

00:05:52.747 --> 00:05:56.087
he's willing to risk
everything he has with Nana.

00:05:56.187 --> 00:05:58.491
If so, there's nothing
we can do.

00:06:00.095 --> 00:06:01.665
- Hi, Shoji. Surprise.

00:06:01.765 --> 00:06:05.238
- Hachi insisted on dragging
us all down here to see you.

00:06:05.338 --> 00:06:05.906
- Oh, right? Yeah.

00:06:06.007 --> 00:06:09.079
I'll see what we've got
available. Hold on a sec.

00:06:09.179 --> 00:06:10.850
Come right this way.

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:12.185
- Huh?

00:06:12.921 --> 00:06:18.331
- Huh?
(door creaks)

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.402
Sachiko?

00:06:32.359 --> 00:06:34.263
- Huh. Looks like they're
closing up.

00:06:34.363 --> 00:06:35.967
They're starting to leave.

00:06:36.067 --> 00:06:37.570
- Finally.

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:38.772
- Sachiko.

00:06:53.301 --> 00:06:57.510
- What are you doing,
Shoji? Who's this girl?

00:07:03.221 --> 00:07:04.390
- My girlfriend.

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:05.492
- What?

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:11.838
Hold on. Are you telling me
you've got two girlfriends.

00:07:11.938 --> 00:07:14.778
Huh. Boy, what a lucky guy.

00:07:14.878 --> 00:07:17.850
- No, don't.

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:21.157
(upbeat rock music)

00:07:21.257 --> 00:07:22.660
- Sachiko, it's okay. Stay back.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:23.494
- Don't hurt him.

00:07:23.595 --> 00:07:25.900
- This has got nothing to do
with you.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.804
- It has nothing to do with you.

00:07:27.904 --> 00:07:28.438
If you want to hit someone,

00:07:28.539 --> 00:07:29.774
you should be hitting me.

00:07:29.874 --> 00:07:30.375
- Hey, come on.

00:07:30.475 --> 00:07:31.444
- It's all my fault.

00:07:31.545 --> 00:07:32.446
I went and fell in love with him

00:07:32.547 --> 00:07:35.085
even though I knew he
had a girlfriend,

00:07:35.185 --> 00:07:35.786
but I just couldn't stop myself.

00:07:35.886 --> 00:07:38.291
- Hachi, why are you just
standing there?

00:07:38.391 --> 00:07:40.730
He's your boyfriend.
You got to do something.

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:43.134
If you don't you're
going to lose him.

00:07:43.234 --> 00:07:46.641
He's your boyfriend,
fight for him.

00:07:48.044 --> 00:07:49.446
- I don't want him

00:07:49.547 --> 00:07:50.583
- Huh?

00:07:52.352 --> 00:07:56.394
- I never want to see him again.

00:07:56.494 --> 00:07:59.868
(sad music playing)

00:08:07.215 --> 00:08:08.919
- That's what happened?

00:08:09.019 --> 00:08:10.388
Wow. That's pretty intense.

00:08:10.488 --> 00:08:12.593
- Yeah. You bet it is.

00:08:12.693 --> 00:08:15.398
- Speak of the devil. There's
the cheater.

00:08:16.167 --> 00:08:18.839
- Then he's getting closer.

00:08:18.939 --> 00:08:20.543
- Now he's leaving again.

00:08:20.643 --> 00:08:24.149
- Come on. Leave the poor
guy alone, would you?

00:08:24.249 --> 00:08:25.586
Hey, Shoji, come over here.

00:08:25.686 --> 00:08:27.957
Why don't you have
a drink with us?

00:08:29.426 --> 00:08:30.596
- I'm home.

00:08:30.696 --> 00:08:32.432
- Hello Hachiko.

00:08:32.533 --> 00:08:33.267
- What's going on?

00:08:33.367 --> 00:08:35.171
- We've got a gig. We've got a
gig.

00:08:35.271 --> 00:08:36.541
There was an open slot for a
band

00:08:36.641 --> 00:08:38.679
on the Bellamoshimoki
and we got it.

00:08:38.779 --> 00:08:41.985
It's on may the fifth.
We got a 30 minute slot.

00:08:43.387 --> 00:08:47.530
(upbeat rock music playing)

00:08:49.233 --> 00:08:49.801
- Yay.

00:08:49.901 --> 00:08:53.007
- Wipe away those tears,
okay? We're celebrating.

00:08:55.211 --> 00:08:59.286
(upbeat rock music playing)

00:10:23.856 --> 00:10:24.389
- I see.

00:10:24.489 --> 00:10:26.193
So how's Nana been doing?

00:10:26.293 --> 00:10:27.597
Has she recovered from the shock
yet?

00:10:27.697 --> 00:10:30.101
- Well, I guess you
could say she's recovered

00:10:30.201 --> 00:10:31.638
but it's not as simple as that.

00:10:31.738 --> 00:10:33.341
- So she's still
feeling depressed.

00:10:33.441 --> 00:10:34.176
- No, no. It's not that.

00:10:34.276 --> 00:10:37.382
- The trouble is it's never
just one thing with Nana.

00:10:37.482 --> 00:10:39.521
There's always so much going on.

00:10:39.621 --> 00:10:43.194
- Just wait till you hear
the rest Koichi Sato.

00:10:43.294 --> 00:10:44.429
- I had the best time ever.

00:10:44.531 --> 00:10:45.599
Getting to hang out with Blast,

00:10:45.699 --> 00:10:46.735
and spending all that time with
Nana

00:10:46.835 --> 00:10:48.772
talking about all
kinds of things.

00:10:48.872 --> 00:10:51.511
I feel like I've been
in a dream.

00:10:51.611 --> 00:10:53.014
- You're so funny.

00:10:53.114 --> 00:10:54.116
- No, really I'm serious.

00:10:54.216 --> 00:10:56.922
I've been a huge fan ever
since the band started out

00:10:57.022 --> 00:10:59.359
but nothing like this
has ever happened before.

00:10:59.459 --> 00:11:01.363
I mean, I got to hang
out with them.

00:11:01.463 --> 00:11:02.165
- You really are a fan.

00:11:02.265 --> 00:11:04.704
So how long has it been
since they first started out?

00:11:04.804 --> 00:11:06.373
- Well, it was back when Ren was

00:11:06.473 --> 00:11:08.512
in the band and that
was like four years ago.

00:11:08.612 --> 00:11:11.050
It was a big deal when
Ren left Blast.

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:15.893
But don't you think that new
guy Sheen plays a lot like him?

00:11:15.993 --> 00:11:19.233
So this show was just like
watching the old Blast again.

00:11:19.333 --> 00:11:21.303
It was totally amazing.

00:11:21.403 --> 00:11:24.009
- Tell me who your
favorite bass player is?

00:11:24.109 --> 00:11:25.512
- Ren Honjo.

00:11:26.648 --> 00:11:27.883
- What made you choose a Lotus
blossom?

00:11:27.984 --> 00:11:29.721
Does it have like a
special meaning?

00:11:29.821 --> 00:11:31.056
- Actually it's not a
Lotus.

00:11:31.156 --> 00:11:32.526
It's a red flower.

00:11:34.463 --> 00:11:35.766
- No way.

00:11:37.135 --> 00:11:37.703
- Well, to be honest,

00:11:37.803 --> 00:11:39.741
I don't know if I should say
anything.

00:11:39.841 --> 00:11:41.443
- Come on Nobu, you can tell me,

00:11:41.544 --> 00:11:43.014
you know, everything don't you?

00:11:43.114 --> 00:11:45.853
- You told me that Ren used to
be the bass player at Blast.

00:11:45.953 --> 00:11:47.690
He hooked up with Nana
and they lived together.

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:49.627
But a couple of years ago
he was offered the chance

00:11:49.727 --> 00:11:51.564
to be the guitar player for
Trapnest.

00:11:51.665 --> 00:11:52.566
So he left for Tokyo

00:11:52.667 --> 00:11:54.436
and no one in the band
has heard from him since.

00:11:54.537 --> 00:11:56.273
- And I guess I said it all.

00:11:56.373 --> 00:11:56.808
- But hold on.

00:11:56.908 --> 00:11:58.377
You said no one's heard
from him.

00:11:58.477 --> 00:11:59.046
Not even Nana?

00:11:59.146 --> 00:12:01.350
- They had a really tough
breakup didn't they?

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:03.020
- Yeah, that's about right.

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:06.093
I really did tell you
everything that happened.

00:12:17.817 --> 00:12:18.952
I'm not mad at Ren for what
he did

00:12:19.052 --> 00:12:21.223
and I really don't
want to badmouth him.

00:12:21.323 --> 00:12:22.660
But what happened was
Ren decided

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:23.662
to quit playing with Blast,

00:12:23.762 --> 00:12:25.699
and join Trapnest
without discussing it

00:12:25.799 --> 00:12:26.968
with Nana and me first.

00:12:27.068 --> 00:12:30.542
The only person he talked
it over with was Yasu.

00:12:32.847 --> 00:12:35.251
So at the time I felt
totally betrayed.

00:12:35.351 --> 00:12:36.688
It was a real shock.

00:12:36.788 --> 00:12:38.157
The band was everything to me.

00:12:38.257 --> 00:12:39.359
And I felt like he was saying

00:12:39.459 --> 00:12:41.163
we weren't good enough for him.

00:12:41.263 --> 00:12:44.136
Plus I guess I was jealous.

00:12:44.236 --> 00:12:46.574
Nana and I knew the
opportunity was too good

00:12:46.675 --> 00:12:47.475
for him to turn down,

00:12:47.576 --> 00:12:49.413
and we didn't want to
stand in his way.

00:12:49.514 --> 00:12:51.216
We had to respect what
the offer meant

00:12:51.317 --> 00:12:52.419
to him and his career.

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:54.891
So we accepted his decision.

00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:05.144
Well, I think it was
the best thing for them,

00:13:05.244 --> 00:13:10.355
but Nana, well Nana
could have gone with Ren.

00:13:10.455 --> 00:13:12.793
But she had too much pride

00:13:12.893 --> 00:13:16.066
to simply be the girlfriend
of a big rock star.

00:13:19.172 --> 00:13:21.778
I think that's the main
reason why she's so focused

00:13:21.878 --> 00:13:24.717
on becoming a successful
musician.

00:13:24.817 --> 00:13:26.086
She's determined to be as big

00:13:26.186 --> 00:13:29.527
or even bigger than
Ren and Trapnest.

00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:34.202
Sometimes it's hard to watch
her struggle with that.

00:14:49.152 --> 00:14:51.691
- Are you still in
love with Ren?

00:14:58.738 --> 00:15:00.107
- So you knew.

00:15:02.312 --> 00:15:03.314
- Yeah. I'm sorry.

00:15:03.414 --> 00:15:05.184
I only just found out, but I-

00:15:05.284 --> 00:15:08.257
- You knew? And that's
why you brought me here?

00:15:10.629 --> 00:15:11.931
Thank you.

00:16:35.498 --> 00:16:37.068
- Ren?

00:16:37.168 --> 00:16:39.941
Did you really mean what
you just said?

00:16:40.041 --> 00:16:41.945
- What part are you
talking about?

00:16:42.045 --> 00:16:43.113
- I've got my pride, you know,

00:16:43.214 --> 00:16:44.984
and I've got my own
career ahead of me.

00:16:45.084 --> 00:16:47.890
I can't live with you
like we did before.

00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:49.927
I just, it wouldn't work,

00:16:50.027 --> 00:16:52.733
but I'd be into us
getting together

00:16:52.833 --> 00:16:55.004
like this from time to time.

00:16:55.104 --> 00:16:58.578
Being with each other,
holding each other,

00:16:58.678 --> 00:17:00.649
talking to each other.

00:17:00.749 --> 00:17:03.788
And then someday when I'm older,

00:17:03.888 --> 00:17:07.663
when my pride and vanity
have faded away,

00:17:07.763 --> 00:17:10.769
and I get tired of singing.

00:17:10.869 --> 00:17:14.510
Then can I go back there
and retire with you?

00:17:28.638 --> 00:17:31.476
- So you see that's
pretty much what happened.

00:17:31.577 --> 00:17:33.280
Hey, where's Kochi Soto.

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:33.949
- Didn't you notice?

00:17:34.049 --> 00:17:34.750
He left a while ago.

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:35.886
- Without paying his bill.

00:17:35.986 --> 00:17:37.990
- Look, he left the
Jackson burger for you.

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:39.159
- Thinks he can barter.

00:17:39.259 --> 00:17:40.127
Does he?

00:17:40.227 --> 00:17:42.833
Oh, although his Jackson
burgers are tasty.

00:17:42.933 --> 00:17:44.870
- I bet it's cold by now.

00:17:44.971 --> 00:17:45.806
- Welcome.

00:17:45.906 --> 00:17:47.175
Come in, take a seat.

00:17:48.578 --> 00:17:51.684
Why did a 38 year old spinster
like Sakagami come here?

00:17:51.784 --> 00:17:54.322
- Because of all her
die hard fans,

00:17:54.924 --> 00:17:56.293
who don't exist.

00:17:56.393 --> 00:17:57.930
- Yeah, no kidding.

00:17:58.030 --> 00:17:59.232
- Hey you over there?

00:17:59.332 --> 00:17:59.800
- Yes?

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:00.702
- I hear your friends
with Nana Kamatsu.

00:18:00.802 --> 00:18:02.539
What is it with that girl?

00:18:03.508 --> 00:18:06.380
(fast speaking)

00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:08.417
- She's the kind of character

00:18:08.518 --> 00:18:10.555
who only makes a few guest
appearances

00:18:10.656 --> 00:18:12.125
even fewer than Kochi Sato.

00:18:12.225 --> 00:18:14.195
And that's saying something.

00:18:14.295 --> 00:18:14.764
- Yeah.

00:18:14.864 --> 00:18:16.466
If you ask me, this is
getting kind of weird.

00:18:16.567 --> 00:18:19.740
Why are all the minor
characters coming to visit us?

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:21.911
- Because this is where
all the minor characters

00:18:22.011 --> 00:18:24.282
come for a drink once
our time is up.

00:18:24.382 --> 00:18:24.583
- Huh?

00:18:24.684 --> 00:18:28.390
- Isn't that why you three
are here leading the way?

00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:29.760
- [Both] No way.

00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:30.929
- No, that's impossible.

00:18:31.029 --> 00:18:31.798
- We're going to be appearing

00:18:31.898 --> 00:18:33.267
in lots more episodes.

00:18:33.367 --> 00:18:34.035
- Really?

00:18:34.135 --> 00:18:34.770
You know that for sure?

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:37.141
- [Both] That's not your
decision to make.

00:18:39.112 --> 00:18:42.720
- From what I can see your
garden's ripe for harvest.

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:44.824
- I want happiness and I want it
now.

00:18:44.924 --> 00:18:46.026
I mean, I want a boyfriend.

00:18:46.126 --> 00:18:47.328
- Why don't we organize a
party for you?

00:18:47.428 --> 00:18:49.800
- No, I don't think
that'll do any good.

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:50.869
This time when I fall in love,

00:18:50.969 --> 00:18:52.138
I want it to be like destiny

00:18:52.238 --> 00:18:53.374
but a party's a good idea,

00:18:53.474 --> 00:18:55.211
because who knows who
I might meet?

00:18:55.311 --> 00:18:56.781
- Hey, Yasu tell me something.

00:18:56.881 --> 00:18:58.050
Do you have a girlfriend?

00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:01.724
- I don't seem to be very
popular with the ladies.

00:19:01.824 --> 00:19:04.663
- So Nobu, do you have
a girlfriend right now?

00:19:04.764 --> 00:19:06.033
- Not right now.

00:19:06.133 --> 00:19:08.872
Do you know anyone
who's available?

00:19:18.123 --> 00:19:20.161
- Nana, Welcome home.

00:19:27.008 --> 00:19:27.976
- Miss Komatsu.

00:19:28.077 --> 00:19:30.014
How long does it take to
sort through some postcards?

00:19:30.114 --> 00:19:31.751
You really are slow.

00:19:31.851 --> 00:19:32.452
Miss Komatsu.

00:19:32.553 --> 00:19:34.824
Don't you even know how
to use a photocopier.

00:19:34.924 --> 00:19:36.226
- Thanks June.

00:19:36.326 --> 00:19:37.295
Miss Sakagami

00:19:37.395 --> 00:19:38.932
What are you doing wasting time
out here?

00:19:39.032 --> 00:19:40.902
Don't you have a lot
of work to do.

00:19:41.002 --> 00:19:42.740
Oh, miss Sakagami.

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:44.476
The boss just fired me.

00:19:44.577 --> 00:19:45.512
- Of course he did.

00:19:45.612 --> 00:19:46.848
- I can't believe it.

00:19:46.948 --> 00:19:48.785
I know you were always
really strict with me

00:19:48.885 --> 00:19:50.522
but I thought you were on my
side

00:19:50.622 --> 00:19:51.490
and you'd stand up for me.

00:19:51.591 --> 00:19:53.695
- The world doesn't
just revolve around you.

00:19:53.795 --> 00:19:54.764
You have no idea.

00:19:54.864 --> 00:19:56.466
How much of a slacker you are.

00:19:56.567 --> 00:19:57.569
Goodbye.

00:20:04.583 --> 00:20:07.990
(cellphone ringing)

00:20:12.666 --> 00:20:13.400
- Hello?

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:14.870
- Is this Nana?

00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:16.507
It's me Takumi.

00:20:17.843 --> 00:20:19.312
Can you talk right now?

00:20:20.849 --> 00:20:22.084
- Yeah

00:20:23.888 --> 00:20:27.361
(slow music playing)

00:22:14.042 --> 00:22:14.944
- Well, that's all folks.

00:22:15.044 --> 00:22:18.050
Hope you enjoyed the second
installment of Junko's place.

00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:18.985
We sure did.

00:22:19.085 --> 00:22:20.254
See you next time.

00:22:20.354 --> 00:22:21.489
Bye bye everyone.

00:22:21.591 --> 00:22:24.028
- You sound pathetic,
you know that?
