00:00:05.255 --> 00:00:08.829
- [Nana] I knew Ren wanted
to have kids.

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:11.735
I also knew it was possible
for me to have kids,

00:00:11.835 --> 00:00:13.539
and still be a singer.

00:00:16.477 --> 00:00:18.982
I think the problem was,

00:00:19.083 --> 00:00:21.888
I was just too scared of being a
mother.

00:00:23.559 --> 00:00:26.297
(rock music)

00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:05.261
(keypad beeping)

00:02:07.533 --> 00:02:10.205
(sighing)

00:02:10.305 --> 00:02:11.407
- You're here again?

00:02:11.508 --> 00:02:13.645
- You're the one who called me
here.

00:02:13.745 --> 00:02:15.248
- Did you tape the show for me?

00:02:15.348 --> 00:02:19.256
- You keep making such dumb
excuses to get me to come over.

00:02:19.356 --> 00:02:21.293
- Hutch isn't a dumb excuse.

00:02:21.393 --> 00:02:24.734
He's an orphan, just like you
and me.

00:02:24.834 --> 00:02:26.705
I better leave, and make you
cry.

00:02:26.805 --> 00:02:29.577
- Cry on your own, I'm going to
bed.

00:02:29.677 --> 00:02:32.082
- Oh, good morning.

00:02:32.182 --> 00:02:34.286
Are you feeling better
today, Miss Hachiko?

00:02:34.386 --> 00:02:36.525
- Yeah, I'm sorry for making
you worry.

00:02:36.625 --> 00:02:38.595
I think this heat wave
has just been getting to me,

00:02:38.695 --> 00:02:40.666
but I'll go see a doctor,
just in case.

00:02:40.766 --> 00:02:43.639
I've gotta get better, or
else I can't go back to work.

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.141
- That's a really good idea.

00:02:45.241 --> 00:02:46.845
And I think I'm gonna come with
you.

00:02:46.945 --> 00:02:48.549
- Oh no, you're not.

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:51.988
You have to stay, put and finish
all of your homework today.

00:02:52.088 --> 00:02:55.128
- Please don't remind
me about that.

00:02:56.965 --> 00:02:57.767
- Make sure to study hard,

00:02:57.867 --> 00:03:00.305
and I promise I'll go over
your work, when I get back.

00:03:00.405 --> 00:03:02.175
- Thank you, that's really
sweet of you.

00:03:02.275 --> 00:03:04.514
And please promise you won't
tell Nana or the others,

00:03:04.614 --> 00:03:06.417
that I've been feeling
sick, okay?

00:03:06.518 --> 00:03:09.289
It's just that, I don't want
them to have to worry about me,

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:11.962
when they've got so much
other stuff going on.

00:03:12.062 --> 00:03:14.099
- But I'm going back
home tomorrow.

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:16.705
Aren't you worried about
being here all alone?

00:03:16.805 --> 00:03:18.341
You should at least tell Nana,

00:03:18.441 --> 00:03:21.413
so that she can be here for you.

00:03:21.515 --> 00:03:24.453
- Thanks, but I think
I'll be okay on my own.

00:03:29.898 --> 00:03:34.641
- Miss Kamatsu, the doctor
is ready to see you now.

00:03:34.741 --> 00:03:37.513
- Yes, it seems the urine
test came out positive.

00:03:37.613 --> 00:03:41.387
Tell me, do you remember when
you had your last period?

00:03:41.487 --> 00:03:42.857
- July 16th?

00:03:42.957 --> 00:03:45.930
It lasted about five days.

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.998
- If you are pregnant,

00:03:47.098 --> 00:03:49.537
are you planning on
keeping the baby?

00:03:52.777 --> 00:03:56.217
(melancholic melody)

00:04:00.024 --> 00:04:02.295
Let's do an exam
first, shall we?

00:04:02.395 --> 00:04:03.799
I'll meet you in the other room.

00:04:03.899 --> 00:04:06.136
- Miss Kamatsu this way, please.

00:04:06.237 --> 00:04:10.546
(melancholic melody continues)

00:04:13.217 --> 00:04:13.619
Please take your underwear off,

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:16.323
and lie down on the
examination table.

00:04:16.423 --> 00:04:18.862
You may keep your skirt
on if you want.

00:04:18.962 --> 00:04:20.365
- Ugh, okay.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.674
(piano melody continues)

00:04:29.817 --> 00:04:33.257
- [Nobu] I don't deal well
with inconveniences like that.

00:04:40.906 --> 00:04:45.381
- [Nurse] Okay, Miss Kamatsu,
please try to relax.

00:04:49.891 --> 00:04:51.795
- [Nobu] I'll be waiting
for you.

00:04:59.443 --> 00:05:01.413
- Well, you are pregnant.

00:05:01.514 --> 00:05:05.823
Now, this small black
circle is the chorionic sac.

00:05:05.923 --> 00:05:07.860
That little dot you see inside,

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.363
it's your baby.

00:05:09.463 --> 00:05:10.799
We count the weeks you're
pregnant

00:05:10.899 --> 00:05:14.473
by counting the week of your
last period as week zero.

00:05:14.574 --> 00:05:18.047
So you are in the middle
of the sixth week.

00:05:18.147 --> 00:05:19.316
If you decide to keep the baby,

00:05:19.416 --> 00:05:22.288
please come back in two
weeks for a checkup.

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:24.493
If you wish to have an abortion,

00:05:24.594 --> 00:05:26.931
well the sooner we schedule
the operation,

00:05:27.032 --> 00:05:29.537
the easier it will
be on your body.

00:05:32.175 --> 00:05:34.547
You can keep the
ultrasound if you like.

00:05:34.647 --> 00:05:35.649
- Huh?

00:05:51.681 --> 00:05:53.952
Okay.

00:05:54.052 --> 00:05:56.357
- What? He grew up overseas?

00:05:56.991 --> 00:05:57.626
Which country?

00:05:57.727 --> 00:05:59.296
- I wasn't able to find
that out.

00:05:59.396 --> 00:06:02.369
So I guess didn't know
about this either?

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:03.805
- No, I didn't. Did you?

00:06:03.905 --> 00:06:05.007
- Uh-huh.

00:06:05.108 --> 00:06:06.578
I was surprised too when
Misato told me,

00:06:06.678 --> 00:06:08.180
but then I
remembered,

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.984
Shin didn't know anything
about Tanabata,

00:06:10.084 --> 00:06:12.990
so all the things I thought
were weird about him,

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:14.292
seem to make sense now.

00:06:14.393 --> 00:06:15.562
- Yeah, I guess so.

00:06:15.662 --> 00:06:16.965
But his parents are Japanese,

00:06:17.065 --> 00:06:18.869
so you'd think they
would've at least told him

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:20.405
what Tanabata was.

00:06:20.506 --> 00:06:22.108
- Are you ready to order?

00:06:22.208 --> 00:06:23.779
- Oh, what are you
having Hachiko?

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:26.350
- Hmm... I'll have a
grapefruit juice.

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:28.020
- Hey, aren't you eating?

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.757
- I'm not really hungry.

00:06:29.857 --> 00:06:30.526
- [Nana] Really? Okay,

00:06:30.626 --> 00:06:32.763
well we'll have two
veggie sandwiches,

00:06:32.863 --> 00:06:33.932
and two cafe au laits.

00:06:34.032 --> 00:06:35.468
- [Waiter] You got it.

00:06:38.274 --> 00:06:39.644
- Nana, do you think
you could stay

00:06:39.744 --> 00:06:41.447
at your place a bit
more often?

00:06:41.548 --> 00:06:44.119
It's just that Hachiko hasn't
been feeling very well,

00:06:44.219 --> 00:06:47.492
and I hate to think of
her being all alone.

00:06:47.593 --> 00:06:50.264
- Really? So that's why you
seem so out of it lately.

00:06:50.364 --> 00:06:52.268
- Oh, it's just some
kind of stomach thing.

00:06:52.368 --> 00:06:54.473
I'm alright, the doctor
even told me so.

00:06:54.574 --> 00:06:56.176
- You had to go to a doctor?!

00:06:56.276 --> 00:06:57.546
That is definitely not alright.

00:06:57.646 --> 00:07:01.019
- But the doctor said I'm
alright, so I'm alright.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.658
- Yeah, but that is so
not the point.

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:07.098
You're right, Misato, I'm
back home, starting tonight.

00:07:07.198 --> 00:07:08.134
So don't worry.

00:07:08.234 --> 00:07:10.739
- That's great, thanks.

00:07:10.839 --> 00:07:15.181
Oh, so going back to what
I was saying about Shin,

00:07:15.281 --> 00:07:17.085
I assumed he was half Japanese,

00:07:17.185 --> 00:07:18.020
so without thinking,

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:18.889
I told him I didn't believe

00:07:18.989 --> 00:07:20.759
that both his parents were
Japanese,

00:07:20.859 --> 00:07:23.832
and Shin told me that he
didn't believe it either.

00:07:23.932 --> 00:07:26.771
Then he said that he wished
he'd never been born.

00:07:26.871 --> 00:07:29.209
I can't imagine anyone
going through life

00:07:29.309 --> 00:07:31.614
feeling like that.

00:07:31.714 --> 00:07:33.350
I don't know what happened to
him.

00:07:33.451 --> 00:07:34.554
But like I told that
Hachiko,

00:07:34.654 --> 00:07:39.229
that kind of thinking is
like denying his own existence.

00:07:39.329 --> 00:07:42.803
(sad music)

00:07:42.903 --> 00:07:45.876
- [Mother] I'll come back
to get you Nana, okay?

00:07:51.921 --> 00:07:53.592
I'll come back soon.

00:07:58.568 --> 00:08:00.438
- No, rejecting his parents,

00:08:00.539 --> 00:08:01.941
and denying his existence,

00:08:02.041 --> 00:08:03.612
are totally different.

00:08:03.712 --> 00:08:04.981
Shin's not a kid anymore.

00:08:05.081 --> 00:08:07.686
So he should be capable of
figuring out for himself

00:08:07.786 --> 00:08:10.258
why he deserves to exist.

00:08:10.358 --> 00:08:11.861
- You really think so?

00:08:11.961 --> 00:08:14.332
- Yeah, I believe if
we put our minds to it,

00:08:14.432 --> 00:08:17.372
we're all able to determine
our own fates.

00:08:17.472 --> 00:08:19.142
Right now, he has a purpose
in life,

00:08:19.242 --> 00:08:21.246
and that's to work hard
on our album.

00:08:21.346 --> 00:08:22.850
- Yeah, a purpose in life.

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:23.852
That's it.

00:08:23.952 --> 00:08:24.419
- Here you are, ladies.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:25.823
- Ever since I became
a die hard Blast fan,

00:08:25.923 --> 00:08:28.829
my life has been nothing
but a big bunch of roses.

00:08:28.929 --> 00:08:30.498
- Roses?
- Roses?

00:08:31.233 --> 00:08:33.872
(laughing)

00:08:35.542 --> 00:08:37.713
- All right, Nana, Hachiko,

00:08:37.813 --> 00:08:39.517
thanks so much for everything.

00:08:39.617 --> 00:08:40.552
Could you do me a favor,

00:08:40.652 --> 00:08:42.188
and tell everyone that I
said goodbye?

00:08:42.288 --> 00:08:46.263
- Take care Misato, and come
stay with us again sometime.

00:08:46.363 --> 00:08:47.800
(giggling)

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:51.875
- And I promise we'll become
the biggest band in Japan,

00:08:51.975 --> 00:08:54.814
to keep giving you a
purpose in life.

00:08:56.818 --> 00:08:59.022
(crying)

00:09:00.358 --> 00:09:01.661
What are you crying for?

00:09:01.761 --> 00:09:05.636
- Come on Nana, you
made her cry on purpose.

00:09:05.736 --> 00:09:08.508
- Misato, you started coming
by yourself to our shows

00:09:08.608 --> 00:09:11.079
back when you were
in junior high.

00:09:11.179 --> 00:09:13.183
I was always worried about you.

00:09:13.284 --> 00:09:16.290
Back home, I know you don't
get along with your parents,

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:20.298
and you don't seem to have
any friends, other than us.

00:09:20.398 --> 00:09:22.235
When you say out loud, that my
band,

00:09:22.335 --> 00:09:23.705
is your reason
for living,

00:09:23.805 --> 00:09:26.611
other people might
think that's foolish,

00:09:26.711 --> 00:09:29.382
but it means the world to me.

00:09:30.151 --> 00:09:32.388
You know that don't you?

00:09:36.396 --> 00:09:38.300
You know, Shin's situation
with his family

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:39.770
has got me thinking.

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:42.408
My guess is that his mother
probably had an affair

00:09:42.509 --> 00:09:43.545
in another country,

00:09:43.645 --> 00:09:46.684
and his parents broke up
because Shin came along.

00:09:47.318 --> 00:09:48.420
- Yeah, I don't know.

00:09:48.521 --> 00:09:51.894
It certainly seems like
that's a possibility.

00:09:51.995 --> 00:09:54.132
- But, I wonder why she
had the baby.

00:09:54.232 --> 00:09:57.973
It's such a gamble, not
knowing who the father is.

00:09:58.073 --> 00:09:59.810
Even if the guy she was
having the affair with

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:02.783
used condoms, you can't be
totally sure.

00:10:03.852 --> 00:10:05.722
You've gotta be careful
when you're having sex.

00:10:05.822 --> 00:10:08.695
I mean, the guy might not
put it on right.

00:10:09.563 --> 00:10:10.966
Anyway, all I have to say

00:10:11.066 --> 00:10:13.103
is Shin's parents were
irresponsible,

00:10:13.203 --> 00:10:14.272
and they're to blame.

00:10:14.372 --> 00:10:15.374
If you can't raise a kid right,

00:10:15.474 --> 00:10:17.913
you shouldn't have a baby to
begin with.

00:10:18.013 --> 00:10:18.815
- [Flashback Nana] I haven't
seen her

00:10:18.915 --> 00:10:20.652
since I was four years old.

00:10:20.752 --> 00:10:23.825
She decided to run off
with some guy.

00:10:23.925 --> 00:10:24.994
- [Nana] Too many women have a
kid

00:10:25.094 --> 00:10:27.666
without thinking it
over first.

00:10:33.878 --> 00:10:36.884
- I don't think she wasn't
taking it seriously.

00:10:37.385 --> 00:10:38.755
- Hmm?

00:10:38.855 --> 00:10:39.824
- Maybe there was a reason

00:10:39.924 --> 00:10:41.561
she couldn't raise the
baby right.

00:10:41.661 --> 00:10:45.101
Maybe there were circumstances
beyond her control.

00:10:45.201 --> 00:10:47.405
But when you get pregnant,
it's only natural

00:10:47.506 --> 00:10:50.378
that you want to have
the baby, and raise it.

00:10:50.478 --> 00:10:52.683
- What do you mean natural?

00:10:52.783 --> 00:10:57.291
- Well, you see...

00:10:57.392 --> 00:10:59.530
I can't really explain it.

00:11:00.331 --> 00:11:02.402
It's like maternal instinct.

00:11:02.503 --> 00:11:04.540
(gasps)

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.678
- Is something wrong?

00:11:06.778 --> 00:11:08.515
- No, I've been so busy
recently.

00:11:08.615 --> 00:11:09.583
I might not be able to come in,

00:11:09.684 --> 00:11:10.719
when my prescription runs out,

00:11:10.819 --> 00:11:13.057
so I thought I'd get a
refill now.

00:11:13.157 --> 00:11:13.290
- In that case,

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:16.798
perhaps I should prescribe
two months worth of pills?

00:11:17.966 --> 00:11:20.539
(sighing)

00:11:21.173 --> 00:11:22.141
What's the matter?

00:11:22.241 --> 00:11:26.718
- Um... I have kind of
a weird question.

00:11:26.818 --> 00:11:30.124
I don't really know much
about maternal instinct,

00:11:30.224 --> 00:11:31.861
or any of that kind of stuff.

00:11:31.961 --> 00:11:34.499
Are all women supposed
to have it?

00:11:37.673 --> 00:11:39.710
- Well, I like to
think so.

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:42.215
It's part of what
makes us women.

00:11:44.185 --> 00:11:45.454
(somber music)

00:11:45.555 --> 00:11:47.492
However, just because it exists,

00:11:47.593 --> 00:11:48.795
that doesn't necessarily mean

00:11:48.895 --> 00:11:51.534
it manifests itself the
same way in all women.

00:11:51.634 --> 00:11:53.437
I'd say that applies to
most things.

00:11:53.538 --> 00:11:55.174
It's one of those
internal responses,

00:11:55.274 --> 00:11:58.615
that arise depending
on your circumstances.

00:12:00.217 --> 00:12:02.556
- So right now,

00:12:02.656 --> 00:12:05.829
if I got pregnant
with Ren's child,

00:12:06.496 --> 00:12:09.169
I might wanna keep it?

00:12:09.269 --> 00:12:13.110
Even though it would throw
a huge wrench in my career.

00:12:14.613 --> 00:12:17.953
And I'd do that, not
'cause of Ren?

00:12:18.053 --> 00:12:20.959
But because of
my maternal instinct?

00:12:24.199 --> 00:12:25.201
I don't buy it.

00:12:31.346 --> 00:12:34.920
- My tummy hurts.

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:37.458
- How do you manage to come
down with a stomach ache,

00:12:37.559 --> 00:12:39.830
every single day?

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:41.667
Do you hate practice that much?

00:12:41.768 --> 00:12:44.139
- No, I hate you that much,
Nana.

00:12:44.239 --> 00:12:48.013
Hachi would be nice and take
care of me.

00:12:48.113 --> 00:12:51.019
Ah, why doesn't Hachi come
to the studio anymore?

00:12:51.119 --> 00:12:53.123
- She's just being
considerate of our work.

00:12:53.223 --> 00:12:54.860
This isn't a playground, you
know.

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.964
- But Mr Kawano said it's okay.

00:12:57.064 --> 00:12:59.202
- It's not about Mr Kawano.

00:12:59.302 --> 00:13:00.471
This is Nana's choice.

00:13:00.572 --> 00:13:01.106
- It's not fair.

00:13:01.206 --> 00:13:03.243
You're totally keeping
Hachi all to yourself.

00:13:03.343 --> 00:13:06.951
- I haven't seen her since
the fireworks festival either.

00:13:07.519 --> 00:13:09.088
- Huh? Why not?

00:13:09.189 --> 00:13:11.694
- Well, we practice till
late every single night.

00:13:11.794 --> 00:13:13.464
And we both work during the day.

00:13:13.565 --> 00:13:14.900
We don't have time to hang out.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.104
- But she's been coming
over every single night,

00:13:17.205 --> 00:13:18.942
until just recently.

00:13:19.042 --> 00:13:21.446
- She won't come, even if I ask.

00:13:21.547 --> 00:13:23.383
- Maybe she's on the rag?

00:13:23.484 --> 00:13:24.587
(gasping)

00:13:24.687 --> 00:13:26.591
- Wait a second, weren't you
with Nana,

00:13:26.691 --> 00:13:29.229
to see Misato off at
the train station today?

00:13:29.329 --> 00:13:31.333
You should have brought
her here to the studio.

00:13:31.433 --> 00:13:34.072
- Well, she was feeling a
little bit under the weather.

00:13:34.172 --> 00:13:35.642
- What do you mean under the
weather?

00:13:35.742 --> 00:13:37.646
- It's just a stomach
ache or something.

00:13:37.746 --> 00:13:39.717
The doctor told her that
she'll be just fine.

00:13:39.817 --> 00:13:41.988
- She went to see a doctor?

00:13:42.689 --> 00:13:44.259
I gotta go.

00:13:44.359 --> 00:13:45.227
- If you wanna get to the top,

00:13:45.327 --> 00:13:48.200
you won't skip practice,
even for your mom's funeral.

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:48.835
- What the hell?

00:13:48.935 --> 00:13:50.070
I didn't sign up for this.

00:13:50.171 --> 00:13:50.739
(moaning)

00:13:50.839 --> 00:13:51.974
- Where do you think you're
going?

00:13:52.074 --> 00:13:54.045
- I told you my
tummy hurts.

00:13:54.145 --> 00:13:55.715
- Does he really wanna do this?

00:13:55.816 --> 00:13:58.721
- At least let him go to
the bathroom when he has to.

00:13:58.822 --> 00:14:01.828
You're such a heartless
dictator.

00:14:01.928 --> 00:14:03.731
- I'd say it's more like the
both of you

00:14:03.832 --> 00:14:05.201
are clueless anarchists.

00:14:05.301 --> 00:14:06.436
- Huh?

00:14:06.537 --> 00:14:08.006
- Shin tends to get a stomach
ache

00:14:08.106 --> 00:14:10.244
whenever he needs
a cigarette.

00:14:11.379 --> 00:14:14.319
- Huh?

00:14:14.419 --> 00:14:19.797
- Ugh!

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:27.478
- It was way more fun at
the old studio we went to.

00:14:27.579 --> 00:14:31.286
At least there I could smoke,
and Hachi showed up too.

00:14:33.357 --> 00:14:34.292
- Like I said before,

00:14:34.392 --> 00:14:37.398
it's ludicrous to try and
get a mainstream chart topper

00:14:37.498 --> 00:14:38.768
from some punk band.

00:14:38.868 --> 00:14:40.805
I know you've had this
dream for some time now,

00:14:40.906 --> 00:14:42.108
but you gotta understand,

00:14:42.208 --> 00:14:44.245
the label isn't gonna
throw money into this,

00:14:44.345 --> 00:14:46.116
unless it's a sure shot.

00:14:46.216 --> 00:14:49.389
- [Producer] They don't have
any competition in their genre.

00:14:49.489 --> 00:14:51.026
If they make it, they'll be big.

00:14:51.126 --> 00:14:54.132
And doesn't that vocalist
Nana just blow you away?

00:14:54.232 --> 00:14:56.069
- Sure, they got a lot going for
them.

00:14:56.169 --> 00:14:59.242
But punk rockers wearing
bondage pants?

00:14:59.342 --> 00:14:59.910
Come on.

00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:02.215
It's a bit... outdated.

00:15:03.183 --> 00:15:04.720
- Yeah. But you know, teenagers

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:06.891
are into retro
styles these days.

00:15:06.991 --> 00:15:09.462
When I was young I
dressed like that.

00:15:09.563 --> 00:15:10.064
I was thinner
too. - You know,

00:15:10.164 --> 00:15:12.903
before we do anything else,
we better hire them a stylist.

00:15:13.003 --> 00:15:14.540
Get their fashion up to date.

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:15.174
- No way.

00:15:15.274 --> 00:15:17.044
- Anyway, the main problem
is their sound.

00:15:17.144 --> 00:15:19.583
It's not bad, but it's
not incredible, either.

00:15:19.683 --> 00:15:20.719
Even the vocals.

00:15:20.819 --> 00:15:21.954
They're great live,

00:15:22.054 --> 00:15:24.292
but I'm not sure their
CDs will have much impact.

00:15:24.392 --> 00:15:28.033
- Well, that's where you
come in, Mr Director.

00:15:29.235 --> 00:15:30.572
- [Director] If there's
no money for promotion,

00:15:30.672 --> 00:15:31.807
I don't want to get involved.

00:15:31.907 --> 00:15:33.110
Just let it go.

00:15:37.385 --> 00:15:40.057
(sad music)

00:15:44.833 --> 00:15:47.238
(crying)

00:15:49.843 --> 00:15:50.979
- [Nana] If you can't raise a
kid, right,

00:15:51.079 --> 00:15:53.216
you shouldn't have a
baby to begin with.

00:15:53.317 --> 00:15:56.857
Too many women have a kid
without thinking it over first.

00:15:58.628 --> 00:16:02.001
(slow piano music)

00:16:09.482 --> 00:16:11.687
- [Doctor] If you wish
to have an abortion,

00:16:11.787 --> 00:16:13.958
well, the sooner we
schedule the operation,

00:16:14.058 --> 00:16:16.429
the easier it will be
on your body.

00:16:19.435 --> 00:16:22.108
(doorbell ringing)

00:16:22.208 --> 00:16:23.343
- [Nana] I'm back home,
starting tonight.

00:16:23.443 --> 00:16:24.847
So don't worry.

00:16:34.298 --> 00:16:35.300
- Nana?

00:16:36.971 --> 00:16:38.608
- It's me.

00:16:38.708 --> 00:16:41.046
(gasps)

00:16:46.991 --> 00:16:48.493
Nana, open up.

00:16:52.703 --> 00:16:54.405
Please open the door.

00:16:57.111 --> 00:16:59.315
Oh damn, someone's coming.

00:17:01.721 --> 00:17:05.862
You probably shouldn't
believe everything I say.

00:17:05.962 --> 00:17:08.333
- Why did you come here? Go
away.

00:17:15.447 --> 00:17:17.385
- And what would you suggest
that I do

00:17:17.485 --> 00:17:20.457
if I don't really
feel like going right now?

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:24.432
(Nana groaning)

00:17:27.572 --> 00:17:30.879
(toilet flushing)

00:17:32.916 --> 00:17:35.889
(Nana crying)

00:17:37.692 --> 00:17:39.730
Nana, this isn't very funny.

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:41.099
Cut it out.

00:17:42.769 --> 00:17:45.642
(Nana retching)

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:50.952
Hey, are you all right?

00:17:52.889 --> 00:17:55.127
Do you wanna see a doctor?

00:17:59.737 --> 00:18:00.471
Is it morning sickness?

00:18:00.572 --> 00:18:04.245
- I'm gonna get an
abortion, so don't worry.

00:18:04.345 --> 00:18:07.586
Listen, you don't need
to feel responsible.

00:18:07.686 --> 00:18:09.088
I'm the foolish one.

00:18:09.188 --> 00:18:12.161
For all I know, it
could be my boyfriend's.

00:18:13.998 --> 00:18:19.308
Just go, and please
don't come back.

00:18:21.847 --> 00:18:23.718
- Your boyfriend, Nobu?

00:18:23.818 --> 00:18:26.957
(dramatic flair)

00:18:28.761 --> 00:18:32.168
(suspenseful music)

00:18:34.706 --> 00:18:37.011
- Right, I get it.

00:18:37.111 --> 00:18:40.919
(tense music continues)

00:19:16.824 --> 00:19:18.126
- Takumi?

00:19:19.028 --> 00:19:20.832
(keypad beeping)

00:19:20.932 --> 00:19:23.003
What are you doing?

00:19:24.673 --> 00:19:26.309
My phone!

00:19:30.785 --> 00:19:32.354
Takumi...

00:19:35.962 --> 00:19:38.233
Please don't tell Nobu!

00:19:43.911 --> 00:19:47.151
- Mom always said garlic's
good for stomach aches.

00:19:47.251 --> 00:19:49.021
- So you are coming over?

00:19:49.121 --> 00:19:51.326
If she didn't call back,
she's probably asleep.

00:19:51.426 --> 00:19:53.129
- At least I'll see her
sleeping.

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:56.002
(phone ringing)

00:19:56.102 --> 00:19:58.073
- Hm, it's telepathy!

00:19:58.173 --> 00:19:59.576
- Whatever, just answer it.

00:19:59.676 --> 00:20:01.479
You're such a loser.

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:02.114
- Hello?

00:20:02.214 --> 00:20:03.049
- Hello Nobu.

00:20:03.149 --> 00:20:04.987
It's Takumi here.

00:20:14.005 --> 00:20:15.407
- What is it?

00:20:15.508 --> 00:20:17.846
- [Takumi] Hey, are you there?

00:20:17.946 --> 00:20:19.181
- Yeah.

00:20:19.282 --> 00:20:21.687
- Turns out our Nana
is pregnant.

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:25.728
I don't know if it's yours or
mine,

00:20:25.828 --> 00:20:27.264
but no matter who the father is,

00:20:27.364 --> 00:20:28.400
if Nana wants to keep it,

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:30.772
I plan to recognize
the baby as mine,

00:20:30.872 --> 00:20:32.642
and take care of both of them.

00:20:39.856 --> 00:20:41.660
What do you think about that?

00:20:43.363 --> 00:20:46.737
(melancholic music)

00:20:48.808 --> 00:20:51.547
- [Nana] You know, Hachi,

00:20:51.647 --> 00:20:54.820
I still believe that life
is what you make of it.

00:20:56.256 --> 00:20:57.826
The difference is,

00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:00.464
now I understand,

00:21:00.565 --> 00:21:03.403
that not everybody can
be strong all the time

00:21:05.107 --> 00:21:06.577
because of that,

00:21:06.677 --> 00:21:09.650
I'm nicer to people now,
than I was back then.
