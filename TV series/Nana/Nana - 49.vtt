WEBVTT

00:00:02.405 --> 00:00:05.044
- [Nana O.] We had our huge
advance from the record label,

00:00:05.144 --> 00:00:07.683
our monthly salary
from the agency,

00:00:07.783 --> 00:00:10.354
and the royalties from
our CD sales.

00:00:10.454 --> 00:00:12.826
We weren't the insignificant
amateur band

00:00:12.926 --> 00:00:15.497
living off our
part-time jobs anymore.

00:00:16.634 --> 00:00:18.070
So I thought I'd have no problem

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.109
supporting Hachi and her child.

00:00:21.209 --> 00:00:25.250
("Lucy" by Anna Tsuchiya)

00:02:00.742 --> 00:02:02.646
(clock ticking)

00:02:02.746 --> 00:02:05.618
(alarm ringing)

00:02:07.522 --> 00:02:09.660
(Miu gasping)

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.632
(alarm ringing)

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:19.078
(thudding sound)

00:02:22.652 --> 00:02:25.525
(Nobuo grunting)

00:02:25.625 --> 00:02:28.430
(mellow music)

00:02:30.935 --> 00:02:32.338
(Miu sighing)

00:02:32.438 --> 00:02:35.612
The walls in the dorm are
super thin.

00:02:35.712 --> 00:02:36.881
We played mahjong till dawn

00:02:36.981 --> 00:02:39.653
in the rec room on
the second floor.

00:02:39.753 --> 00:02:40.320
- [Yuri] No.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.256
- [Nana O.] Yuri got wasted,

00:02:41.356 --> 00:02:42.659
so I had to help
her to her room.

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:45.130
- [Yuri] No, really, I'm
all right. (giggling)

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.432
- [Nana O.] Get your hands off
her.

00:02:46.534 --> 00:02:47.401
- [Yasu] Fine.

00:02:47.502 --> 00:02:48.236
- Good night!

00:02:48.336 --> 00:02:50.809
Let's do this again, 'kay?

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:51.844
- [Nana O.] After listening
closely

00:02:51.944 --> 00:02:53.948
to make sure she went
to bed on her own,

00:02:54.048 --> 00:02:55.952
I got into bed too.

00:02:57.288 --> 00:02:58.591
Even if they just slept
together,

00:02:58.691 --> 00:03:01.997
Nobuo would totally fall
in love with her.

00:03:02.097 --> 00:03:03.768
That's just the way he is.

00:03:03.868 --> 00:03:07.174
I don't want him thinking
of Yuri or any other girl.

00:03:07.274 --> 00:03:10.548
I only want him to think
of Hachi. (sighing)

00:03:10.648 --> 00:03:13.788
I wish he'd still be
in love with Hachi.

00:03:13.888 --> 00:03:18.664
But I gotta stop holding
on to such selfish desires.

00:03:18.764 --> 00:03:23.741
God, Buddha, Demon Lord,
whoever's listening,

00:03:23.841 --> 00:03:27.816
please make Nobuo and
Hachiko get back together.

00:03:27.916 --> 00:03:29.418
(knocking on door)

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.458
(Nobuo groaning)

00:03:34.362 --> 00:03:37.134
(knocking on door)

00:03:37.234 --> 00:03:39.038
(door creaking open)

00:03:39.138 --> 00:03:40.274
- Did you know it's after eight?

00:03:40.374 --> 00:03:42.846
You're gonna be late
if you don't get going.

00:03:42.946 --> 00:03:43.648
- What?

00:03:43.748 --> 00:03:45.150
Oh, my alarm clock!

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:46.252
- Yeah, it's been ringing.

00:03:46.352 --> 00:03:48.991
- Does it wake you
up every morning?

00:03:49.091 --> 00:03:50.662
Am I being too loud?

00:03:50.762 --> 00:03:51.597
- Oh, yeah.

00:03:51.697 --> 00:03:52.131
Thanks to you,

00:03:52.231 --> 00:03:55.137
I've been sleeping a whole
lot better these days.

00:03:55.237 --> 00:03:57.041
- [Nobuo] Think she
was being sarcastic?

00:03:57.141 --> 00:03:58.476
- Probably.

00:03:58.578 --> 00:04:00.582
- You're the only one on the
fourth floor, aren't you Shin?

00:04:00.682 --> 00:04:02.686
- Don't even think about
moving down to my floor.

00:04:02.786 --> 00:04:05.357
Why'd you think I ran away from
room 603 in the first place?

00:04:05.457 --> 00:04:07.494
And that was just
after one night.

00:04:07.596 --> 00:04:08.296
- Hmm.

00:04:08.396 --> 00:04:10.902
Then maybe I'll move
down to the third floor.

00:04:11.002 --> 00:04:11.971
I haven't seen anyone there.

00:04:12.071 --> 00:04:14.342
- Anyway, Nobuo, what
are you gonna do today?

00:04:14.442 --> 00:04:17.147
Are you coming to the fireworks
festival?

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:20.320
- Yeah.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:23.226
- So you're gonna get
Hachi back, right?

00:04:23.326 --> 00:04:24.896
- Well-
- You're such a coward.

00:04:24.997 --> 00:04:25.464
- Whatever!

00:04:25.565 --> 00:04:28.938
I just think we need to see
each other first, you know?

00:04:29.038 --> 00:04:32.612
If she's happy, then I'll
know I've gotta accept it.

00:04:32.712 --> 00:04:34.282
I don't wanna get back together
with her

00:04:34.382 --> 00:04:36.654
if she's happy with
how things are.

00:04:37.421 --> 00:04:39.325
But, if she seems sad,

00:04:39.425 --> 00:04:41.764
you know I won't be able
to just leave it like that.

00:04:41.864 --> 00:04:43.099
- Hmm.

00:04:47.976 --> 00:04:48.544
- Hell no!

00:04:48.644 --> 00:04:50.882
You can't cancel an
interview at the last minute

00:04:50.982 --> 00:04:52.719
'cause of personal crap!

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:54.322
(Moroboshi screaming)

00:04:54.422 --> 00:04:56.259
- Nobody said anything about
canceling it.

00:04:56.359 --> 00:04:58.931
We're just asking you to
reschedule it for another day.

00:04:59.031 --> 00:04:59.599
- No way!

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.469
Besides, you'll all get
recognized.

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:02.171
- Relax, okay?

00:05:02.271 --> 00:05:03.239
We've got it covered.

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.444
Mika and Masoru said
they'd make disguises,

00:05:05.545 --> 00:05:07.348
so nobody's gonna recognize us.

00:05:07.448 --> 00:05:07.816
- What?

00:05:07.916 --> 00:05:10.420
You think you can just use
our professional hair stylist

00:05:10.521 --> 00:05:12.257
and makeup artist for
your personal business?

00:05:12.358 --> 00:05:14.161
- When we called and asked
them early this morning,

00:05:14.261 --> 00:05:15.063
they were even more into it

00:05:15.163 --> 00:05:16.499
than they were for
the poster shoot.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.236
- I wonder what kind of
crazy outfits

00:05:18.336 --> 00:05:19.606
they have planned for us.

00:05:19.706 --> 00:05:20.675
- I don't care!

00:05:20.775 --> 00:05:22.177
It's not gonna happen!

00:05:22.277 --> 00:05:25.518
- All right then. (exhaling
smoke)

00:05:25.618 --> 00:05:27.287
I guess we'll just have to
skip work.

00:05:27.388 --> 00:05:29.492
- What did you say?

00:05:29.593 --> 00:05:31.697
Now I've lost all respect for
you.

00:05:31.797 --> 00:05:33.968
You've always had
a terrible attitude

00:05:34.068 --> 00:05:34.703
and your singing sucks,

00:05:34.803 --> 00:05:36.740
but I did like how gung-ho
you were about-

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:37.509
- My singing sucks?

00:05:37.609 --> 00:05:39.680
- Wait, listen to me for a
sec, Ginpei.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.752
You must know by now that if
Nana's being this persistent,

00:05:42.852 --> 00:05:45.591
it's gotta be something
really important to her.

00:05:45.692 --> 00:05:47.929
(bright music)

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:50.802
- Yasu, I get it.

00:05:50.902 --> 00:05:53.039
If you say it's important,
then it must be true-

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:53.808
- What the hell?

00:05:53.908 --> 00:05:56.647
- I'll tell the reporter as
soon as I get ahold of him.

00:05:56.747 --> 00:05:57.448
(van revving)

00:05:57.549 --> 00:05:59.720
- [Nana O.] Why is he
so in love with Yasu?

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:00.588
- Sure, no problem.

00:06:00.688 --> 00:06:02.826
We still got proofing
to work on...

00:06:02.926 --> 00:06:03.393
Monday?

00:06:03.493 --> 00:06:04.495
Yeah, that's cool.

00:06:04.596 --> 00:06:06.132
That way I could finish my game

00:06:06.232 --> 00:06:10.775
and return to normal
society. (laughing)

00:06:10.875 --> 00:06:11.643
(phone beeping)

00:06:11.744 --> 00:06:12.378
- What'd he say?

00:06:12.478 --> 00:06:14.783
- He was pretty pissed
'cause it was so last minute,

00:06:14.883 --> 00:06:17.021
but he said he'd
rescheduled it somehow.

00:06:17.121 --> 00:06:18.123
- Yay!

00:06:18.223 --> 00:06:20.293
- We do apologize for
the trouble, Ginpei.

00:06:20.394 --> 00:06:20.828
- No, it's all right.

00:06:20.928 --> 00:06:24.035
I may look all tough, but I've
got a heart just like you.

00:06:24.135 --> 00:06:26.372
- Good news, huh, Nana?

00:06:26.472 --> 00:06:29.546
- Our band is becoming more
and more like a family.

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:34.388
Ginpei is like the
strong mother type.

00:06:34.488 --> 00:06:36.426
Yasu's the reliable eldest son.

00:06:36.527 --> 00:06:38.697
Nobuo's the
mild-mannered second son.

00:06:38.798 --> 00:06:42.906
And Shin's the bratty baby
that everyone likes to pick on.

00:06:43.006 --> 00:06:44.408
I'm part of this family too,

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:47.816
so I can depend on them
as much as I want.

00:06:47.916 --> 00:06:49.619
Wait, who's the dad?

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.359
If it's the president, we'd
be like a Yakuza family.

00:06:54.261 --> 00:06:56.265
Let's make it the tanuki guy.

00:06:56.365 --> 00:06:59.205
At least he's better than
the fox guy.

00:06:59.305 --> 00:07:01.209
This isn't too bad.

00:07:02.377 --> 00:07:03.881
I've always wanted a big family

00:07:03.981 --> 00:07:05.852
like the ones they have on TV.

00:07:06.954 --> 00:07:10.093
Now, if only Hachi
would marry Nobuo,

00:07:10.193 --> 00:07:11.864
things would be perfect.

00:07:13.501 --> 00:07:16.205
- You're now in your 14th week.

00:07:16.305 --> 00:07:19.011
The baby's growing fine,
everything looks great.

00:07:19.111 --> 00:07:22.151
And I've got a pretty good
idea of the sex of the baby.

00:07:22.251 --> 00:07:24.155
(Nana gasping)

00:07:24.255 --> 00:07:25.658
So, would you like to know now,

00:07:25.758 --> 00:07:29.365
or would you rather wait and
find out when the baby is born?

00:07:30.434 --> 00:07:32.037
(Nana sighing)

00:07:32.137 --> 00:07:35.511
- I really wanna know, but
it might be more fun to wait.

00:07:35.611 --> 00:07:36.947
What should I do?

00:07:38.416 --> 00:07:40.955
- Well, it's still an
educated guess at this point.

00:07:41.055 --> 00:07:42.090
- Okay.

00:07:42.191 --> 00:07:43.359
- I'm glad that
you've gotten over

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:44.729
your morning sickness
so quickly,

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:46.466
but I'm also a bit
worried about you

00:07:46.567 --> 00:07:48.136
suddenly gaining this
much weight.

00:07:48.236 --> 00:07:50.842
Sudden weight gain can be
dangerous to your health

00:07:50.942 --> 00:07:52.244
as well as the baby's.

00:07:52.344 --> 00:07:53.480
You already eat a balanced diet.

00:07:53.581 --> 00:07:55.751
Just watch the portions, okay?

00:07:55.852 --> 00:07:57.187
(footsteps pattering)

00:07:57.287 --> 00:07:59.091
- It's not like I wanna
pack on the pounds,

00:07:59.191 --> 00:08:00.862
but I did eat too much
for lunch.

00:08:00.962 --> 00:08:03.333
Okay, I'll have to avoid
all those tasty food stands

00:08:03.433 --> 00:08:05.303
at the fireworks festival
tonight.

00:08:05.403 --> 00:08:08.777
(stomach growling)

00:08:10.581 --> 00:08:12.519
Did you just say something
Sachiko, huh?

00:08:12.619 --> 00:08:14.155
You want a Jackson Burger?

00:08:14.255 --> 00:08:14.923
Well, I don't know.

00:08:15.023 --> 00:08:18.597
I got a bad feeling
about going there.

00:08:18.697 --> 00:08:19.566
- [Shoji] Maybe I shouldn't go

00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:21.770
to the fireworks
festival at all.

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:22.572
- Come on, dude.

00:08:22.672 --> 00:08:24.509
There's gonna be so
many people down there.

00:08:24.609 --> 00:08:26.613
I doubt the two of you'll
run into each other.

00:08:26.713 --> 00:08:29.318
- Yeah, but what happens
if I do run into her?

00:08:29.418 --> 00:08:32.324
I mean, forget about me,
it'd be bad for Sachiko.

00:08:32.424 --> 00:08:34.663
Her night of fun would
be totally ruined.

00:08:34.763 --> 00:08:36.399
- Personally, I think it'd be
worse

00:08:36.499 --> 00:08:37.034
if you don't take her there,

00:08:37.134 --> 00:08:39.305
'cause you're too worried
about running into your ex.

00:08:39.405 --> 00:08:41.442
- That's exactly why I
don't know what to do.

00:08:41.543 --> 00:08:44.215
God damn, Junko!
- Welcome.

00:08:44.315 --> 00:08:46.285
- Long time no see, Koichi
Satou.

00:08:46.385 --> 00:08:48.389
(Koichi gasping)

00:08:48.489 --> 00:08:49.926
- Hi, Nana.

00:08:50.795 --> 00:08:52.231
- Oh, I knew it.

00:08:52.331 --> 00:08:53.701
The Demon Lord brought me here.

00:08:53.801 --> 00:08:55.605
- Well, if he warned
you why'd you come?

00:08:55.705 --> 00:08:58.777
- Because Sachiko said she was
hungry.

00:08:58.878 --> 00:09:01.215
A Jackson Burger and
fresh orange juice please.

00:09:01.315 --> 00:09:02.652
- Yeah, you bet.

00:09:03.453 --> 00:09:04.488
- Sachiko?

00:09:04.589 --> 00:09:05.591
- She's my baby girl.

00:09:05.691 --> 00:09:07.060
I'm four months pregnant now.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.229
- Why'd you name your baby that?

00:09:08.329 --> 00:09:09.566
What a nightmare?
- Don't ask me!

00:09:09.666 --> 00:09:11.402
I didn't wanna give
her that name either!

00:09:11.503 --> 00:09:13.139
- All right, then don't!

00:09:13.239 --> 00:09:16.980
- You see, my husband insists
on calling her Sachiko.

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:17.715
- Husband?

00:09:17.815 --> 00:09:20.387
You mean Takumi from Trapnest?

00:09:21.255 --> 00:09:22.324
- Jun, you blabbermouth!

00:09:22.424 --> 00:09:23.259
- No way!

00:09:23.359 --> 00:09:24.428
So it's true.

00:09:24.529 --> 00:09:26.332
Don't worry, I won't say a word.

00:09:26.432 --> 00:09:28.938
I swear on the name of
the Demon Lord himself.

00:09:29.038 --> 00:09:30.073
I cross my heart.

00:09:30.173 --> 00:09:30.708
I promise.

00:09:30.808 --> 00:09:33.981
So, could you get me
Reira's autograph?

00:09:34.081 --> 00:09:35.685
- You're a fan?

00:09:35.785 --> 00:09:38.958
- I could take it back home
and make it a family heirloom.

00:09:39.058 --> 00:09:42.632
I bet my grandma will bow her
head and pray to it every day.

00:09:42.732 --> 00:09:43.299
- Give me a break.

00:09:43.399 --> 00:09:45.738
I guess I could always ask
her, but she's really busy,

00:09:45.838 --> 00:09:47.241
so I can't make any promises.

00:09:47.341 --> 00:09:48.510
- You're friends with her?

00:09:48.611 --> 00:09:50.113
(Nana gasping)

00:09:50.213 --> 00:09:51.516
- Sort of.

00:09:51.617 --> 00:09:53.821
- Wow, I'm impressed, Nana.

00:09:53.921 --> 00:09:56.960
You used to be nothing
more than a common hick,

00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:00.166
and now, it's like
you're a celebrity.

00:10:01.536 --> 00:10:02.304
- Oh, stop it!

00:10:02.404 --> 00:10:04.208
I'm just your average pregnant
woman.

00:10:04.308 --> 00:10:06.713
- Okay, now you're just
overdoing it.

00:10:06.813 --> 00:10:08.283
But, seeing how things have
turned out,

00:10:08.383 --> 00:10:11.590
I'd say your best talent is
your self-centered recklessness.

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:15.163
For you, being humble and
secure was never enough.

00:10:15.263 --> 00:10:15.798
I get that now.

00:10:15.898 --> 00:10:19.371
I guess what I'm trying to
say is way to go superstar!

00:10:19.471 --> 00:10:21.409
Climb that social ladder!

00:10:24.281 --> 00:10:25.483
(vehicles zooming)

00:10:25.584 --> 00:10:29.491
- Oh, Take, it looks like
Ren's finally decided

00:10:29.592 --> 00:10:31.295
to marry Nana after all that's
happened.

00:10:31.395 --> 00:10:32.230
(Reira gasping)

00:10:32.331 --> 00:10:32.832
- Marry her?

00:10:32.932 --> 00:10:34.736
- So your powers of persuasion
paid off once again.

00:10:34.836 --> 00:10:36.506
- Nope, I didn't have to say
anything,

00:10:36.607 --> 00:10:37.709
he brought it up himself,

00:10:37.809 --> 00:10:40.080
and he doesn't seem to have
any ulterior motives either.

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:42.685
- That's good, that's
probably best for everyone.

00:10:42.785 --> 00:10:44.154
- He's getting the ring right
now,

00:10:44.254 --> 00:10:46.560
so we'll need to figure out
when he can give it to her.

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:48.396
I say sooner rather than later.

00:10:48.496 --> 00:10:49.498
- [Take] You're right.

00:10:49.599 --> 00:10:51.068
- When he shows that ring
to Nana,

00:10:51.168 --> 00:10:54.274
she'll lose the attitude
and jump happily into his arms.

00:10:54.375 --> 00:10:56.580
There's nothing to worry about.

00:10:59.051 --> 00:11:01.523
- That's a really big
rock you've got there.

00:11:01.623 --> 00:11:02.124
A loser like me

00:11:02.224 --> 00:11:04.629
would never be able to
afford something like that.

00:11:04.729 --> 00:11:06.365
Good call, superstar,

00:11:06.465 --> 00:11:07.869
for not sticking around with me.

00:11:07.969 --> 00:11:09.806
- You make it sound
like I'm some evil woman

00:11:09.906 --> 00:11:11.042
who ditched you without warning.

00:11:11.142 --> 00:11:11.610
- It's the truth!

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:13.179
You had me wrapped
around your little finger

00:11:13.279 --> 00:11:15.751
and then you said, "I don't
want you," like I was your toy.

00:11:15.851 --> 00:11:18.089
- You cheated on me, remember?

00:11:18.189 --> 00:11:18.691
- I'm sorry.

00:11:18.791 --> 00:11:21.395
- So you think apologizing now
will make things all right?

00:11:21.495 --> 00:11:22.999
- Sorry, but it is in the past
now, right?

00:11:23.099 --> 00:11:25.771
- How can you be so callous
about this?

00:11:25.871 --> 00:11:28.610
- I'm only saying what you wanna
hear.

00:11:28.711 --> 00:11:31.115
- You told me so many
times that you loved me,

00:11:31.215 --> 00:11:32.785
but it was all just a big lie.

00:11:32.885 --> 00:11:34.856
- I don't think I ever
told you that.

00:11:34.956 --> 00:11:35.490
(Nana gasping)

00:11:35.591 --> 00:11:36.392
- Yes you did, I heard you!

00:11:36.492 --> 00:11:37.227
- I did not.

00:11:37.327 --> 00:11:38.162
I never lied to you.

00:11:38.262 --> 00:11:39.131
You know, I suck at lying.

00:11:39.231 --> 00:11:42.170
That's why you found out right
away about me and Sachiko.

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:42.872
The whole time we were together,

00:11:42.972 --> 00:11:45.276
I could never keep
anything from you.

00:11:45.377 --> 00:11:47.014
(Nana breathing shakily)

00:11:47.114 --> 00:11:50.220
(Shoji whimpering)

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.055
- Right away, huh?

00:11:51.155 --> 00:11:52.892
It's time you fessed up
and told me everything.

00:11:52.992 --> 00:11:55.230
For instance, why
did you cheat on me?

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:56.867
- I just gave into temptation.

00:11:56.967 --> 00:11:58.871
Maybe it was the Demon Lord.

00:11:58.971 --> 00:12:01.409
- But, for about two weeks
you were dating both of them.

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:02.277
- Back off, dude.

00:12:02.377 --> 00:12:04.849
If you keep sticking your nose
in other people's business,

00:12:04.949 --> 00:12:06.586
somebody might break it for you.

00:12:06.686 --> 00:12:08.557
- For only two weeks?

00:12:09.692 --> 00:12:10.628
That's all?

00:12:10.728 --> 00:12:12.197
You really are lame.

00:12:12.297 --> 00:12:15.136
- Whatever! (laughing)

00:12:20.715 --> 00:12:22.350
- You've changed my opinion of
you.

00:12:22.451 --> 00:12:25.290
You were thinking of Ren's
feelings the whole time.

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:26.158
- Huh?

00:12:26.258 --> 00:12:27.227
Of course.

00:12:27.327 --> 00:12:30.467
You know, I think about
him way more than you do.

00:12:30.568 --> 00:12:31.636
- That's not true.

00:12:31.737 --> 00:12:33.774
I worry about him a lot.

00:12:33.874 --> 00:12:37.214
But, if he marries Nana and
she stays by his side forever,

00:12:37.314 --> 00:12:39.719
then he might quit
those bad habits of his.

00:12:39.819 --> 00:12:42.124
- Oh, that's what you're getting
at.

00:12:42.224 --> 00:12:44.361
- Huh?
- It's all okay.

00:12:44.461 --> 00:12:47.769
The fact of the matter is Ren
can quit whenever he wants to.

00:12:47.869 --> 00:12:50.240
But, right now, he
doesn't feel like it.

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:50.908
- Think so?

00:12:51.008 --> 00:12:52.712
It seems like he does wanna
quit,

00:12:52.812 --> 00:12:54.181
but he just can't figure
out how.

00:12:54.281 --> 00:12:57.287
- Well, if he's gonna
quit, he'll quit.

00:12:57.387 --> 00:12:57.889
- Look who's talking,

00:12:57.989 --> 00:12:59.993
Mr. I'm-gonna-quit-
smoking-for-the-baby.

00:13:00.093 --> 00:13:01.963
You're still sucking
on tobacco, aren't you?

00:13:02.063 --> 00:13:04.736
- Nicotine creates a chemical
dependency in your body.

00:13:04.836 --> 00:13:07.474
It's physically addictive,
so quitting is not that easy.

00:13:07.575 --> 00:13:09.411
- But Ren's psychological
dependency

00:13:09.512 --> 00:13:10.714
is just as much an addiction.

00:13:10.815 --> 00:13:12.718
- Would you keep your voice
down?

00:13:12.819 --> 00:13:15.958
If word gets out about
him, the band is over.

00:13:16.058 --> 00:13:18.530
It's been bothering me too,
you just gotta take it easy.

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:20.668
- Could you please forget
about the band for once,

00:13:20.768 --> 00:13:21.903
and just think about Ren?

00:13:22.003 --> 00:13:24.876
- It isn't my job
to look after him.

00:13:26.646 --> 00:13:28.817
- So that's why you
want him to get married.

00:13:28.917 --> 00:13:32.190
He's a problem for the band
you're hoping Nana will fix.

00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:33.359
- That's not it either.

00:13:33.459 --> 00:13:35.396
In fact, it's a whole other
issue.

00:13:35.497 --> 00:13:36.566
(knocking on door)

00:13:36.666 --> 00:13:37.902
- Huh?
- Yeah.

00:13:38.871 --> 00:13:42.377
- Ah, Mr. Narita, how's it
going?

00:13:42.477 --> 00:13:43.346
- So, what do you think?

00:13:43.446 --> 00:13:44.248
I dyed it this morning.

00:13:44.348 --> 00:13:46.620
- It looks weird on an old guy
like you.

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.222
- Reira, even if he does look
weird,

00:13:48.322 --> 00:13:50.895
you should never talk like
that to the president.

00:13:50.995 --> 00:13:52.030
What brings you here today?

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:53.934
- We've got a meeting with
the agency

00:13:54.034 --> 00:13:55.170
regarding Reira doing
a commercial.

00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:55.838
- Hand off.

00:13:55.938 --> 00:13:57.642
- And what the hell brought you
here?

00:13:57.742 --> 00:13:59.779
- Right, the makeup commercial.

00:13:59.879 --> 00:14:01.248
That's great, Reira.

00:14:01.348 --> 00:14:03.419
You'll be the envy of
even more teenage girls

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:04.722
across the country.
- I don't care about that.

00:14:04.823 --> 00:14:05.891
I just wanna sing.

00:14:05.991 --> 00:14:07.127
- It's not just about you.

00:14:07.227 --> 00:14:09.666
They'll be using our song
for that commercial too.

00:14:09.766 --> 00:14:11.302
- So Take told me about Ren.

00:14:11.402 --> 00:14:13.874
The sooner we can hold a
press conference, the better.

00:14:13.974 --> 00:14:16.847
So get it together and
move things along.

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:19.686
Bye.

00:14:19.786 --> 00:14:20.521
(door closing)

00:14:20.621 --> 00:14:21.121
(Reira blowing raspberries)

00:14:21.222 --> 00:14:24.562
Takumi, how come even the
president suddenly wants Ren

00:14:24.662 --> 00:14:25.564
and Nana to get married?

00:14:25.664 --> 00:14:27.802
- He suggested it in
the first place.

00:14:27.902 --> 00:14:29.572
He wanted Ren to announce to the
press

00:14:29.672 --> 00:14:31.008
that he would protect Nana.

00:14:31.108 --> 00:14:32.344
- Why now?

00:14:32.444 --> 00:14:34.014
- In the end, he just
doesn't want it to look

00:14:34.114 --> 00:14:35.885
like Ren was being used by some
woman.

00:14:35.985 --> 00:14:38.022
It's not good for his image.

00:14:38.122 --> 00:14:38.724
(Reira gasping)

00:14:38.824 --> 00:14:40.895
Narita believes that if
Ren publicly declares

00:14:40.995 --> 00:14:41.630
that he loves Nana,

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:45.538
it'll look like BLAST made
it big off of our coattails.

00:14:45.638 --> 00:14:46.740
- That's so stupid.

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:49.077
- Yeah, well, he's
not very smart.

00:14:49.177 --> 00:14:50.948
Having Ren say we're
getting married

00:14:51.048 --> 00:14:52.585
is really the best way out.

00:14:52.685 --> 00:14:54.622
It'll leave a good
impression on the media

00:14:54.722 --> 00:14:56.358
and it'll satisfy Narita.

00:14:56.458 --> 00:14:59.064
Then this whole stupid
circus can be put to rest.

00:14:59.164 --> 00:15:01.435
- You're making him get
married to protect yourself.

00:15:01.536 --> 00:15:02.270
You're such a bastard!

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:04.876
- Hey, whatever you think
about me is in no way related

00:15:04.976 --> 00:15:07.013
to the problems Ren's
gotten himself into.

00:15:07.113 --> 00:15:09.552
This is a business we're
talking about here.

00:15:09.652 --> 00:15:11.957
That's what I hate
about you women.

00:15:17.067 --> 00:15:18.837
- Well then, I'd like
to point this out

00:15:18.937 --> 00:15:21.676
strictly from a business
point of view.

00:15:21.776 --> 00:15:22.712
As Narita said himself,

00:15:22.812 --> 00:15:25.216
the core of our fan base
is teenage girls.

00:15:25.316 --> 00:15:25.784
With that in mind,

00:15:25.884 --> 00:15:27.387
I don't think you and Ren
getting married,

00:15:27.487 --> 00:15:30.794
one after the other,
is such a good idea.

00:15:30.894 --> 00:15:32.063
And you're totally delusional

00:15:32.163 --> 00:15:35.003
if you think they like
us just for our music.

00:15:35.838 --> 00:15:36.840
(Takumi sighing)

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:37.708
- I get it.

00:15:37.808 --> 00:15:39.746
It's better if only Ren
got married.

00:15:39.846 --> 00:15:42.919
(Reira gasping)

00:15:50.701 --> 00:15:51.870
- Why is Sachiko out working,

00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:53.740
while you're just hanging around
here?

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:54.642
- We work different shifts.

00:15:54.742 --> 00:15:58.015
- You should work harder
so that she can relax more.

00:15:58.115 --> 00:16:00.854
- But we split all of the bills,
50-50.

00:16:00.955 --> 00:16:02.925
- So, she's like a good
housewife then?

00:16:03.025 --> 00:16:04.061
- She's not my wife.

00:16:04.161 --> 00:16:05.731
And this may come as a shock to
you,

00:16:05.831 --> 00:16:06.967
but that's usually how it works.

00:16:07.067 --> 00:16:09.137
Most girls don't
freeload like you do.

00:16:09.237 --> 00:16:10.039
That's why it's a good thing

00:16:10.139 --> 00:16:12.444
you're marrying a guy
with deep pockets.

00:16:12.545 --> 00:16:14.247
- Hey, not that it's any
of your business,

00:16:14.348 --> 00:16:17.487
but I've grown up a
lot recently, okay, Shoji?

00:16:17.588 --> 00:16:19.157
- I realized that.

00:16:20.059 --> 00:16:21.563
- Jun, you big blabbermouth.

00:16:21.663 --> 00:16:23.399
- So, Nana, who are you
gonna see the fireworks with?

00:16:23.499 --> 00:16:25.003
- I can't tell you that!

00:16:25.103 --> 00:16:26.806
Us celebrities have a
lot of secrets

00:16:26.906 --> 00:16:28.442
that we can't reveal to
the masses.

00:16:28.543 --> 00:16:30.113
(Shoji laughing)

00:16:30.213 --> 00:16:32.585
So if we accidentally run
into each other over there,

00:16:32.685 --> 00:16:33.587
don't say hi,

00:16:33.687 --> 00:16:35.323
and I'll pretend I don't see you
either.

00:16:35.423 --> 00:16:37.728
(car zooming past)

00:16:37.828 --> 00:16:41.870
(motorcycle zooming past)

00:16:50.119 --> 00:16:52.324
- I really am sorry.

00:16:52.424 --> 00:16:55.831
(melancholic music)

00:16:56.332 --> 00:16:57.467
- It's okay.

00:16:57.568 --> 00:17:00.941
I know that I wasn't the
easiest to live with either.

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:05.416
- But now that I think about it,

00:17:05.517 --> 00:17:07.688
you never really did ask too
much of me

00:17:07.788 --> 00:17:09.224
when we were together.

00:17:11.896 --> 00:17:14.669
I hope me saying this doesn't
bother you,

00:17:14.769 --> 00:17:15.804
but the thing is,

00:17:15.904 --> 00:17:18.677
I still have fun when
I'm around you, Nana.

00:17:18.777 --> 00:17:20.814
And I'm glad we got to talk.

00:17:22.618 --> 00:17:24.922
I probably won't see you again.

00:17:25.023 --> 00:17:26.191
(Nana gasping)

00:17:26.291 --> 00:17:29.866
I guess we've all gotta live
with the choices we've made.

00:17:30.868 --> 00:17:32.037
Goodbye, Nana.

00:17:32.137 --> 00:17:35.744
(melancholic music)

00:17:35.844 --> 00:17:38.349
(Nana grunting)

00:17:38.449 --> 00:17:41.856
(melancholic music)

00:17:46.231 --> 00:17:47.668
- Well, are you going?

00:17:47.768 --> 00:17:49.839
- No, I want you to go first.

00:17:49.939 --> 00:17:51.408
Where are you meeting the
others?

00:17:51.509 --> 00:17:52.477
- I can't tell you that.

00:17:52.578 --> 00:17:53.245
I still have time,

00:17:53.345 --> 00:17:55.416
so I'll just wander around here
for a bit.

00:17:55.517 --> 00:17:57.988
- You like to wander around,
don't you?

00:17:58.089 --> 00:17:59.357
Even though you usually get lost
doing it.

00:17:59.458 --> 00:18:03.332
- I don't get lost
anymore, so hurry and go.

00:18:04.034 --> 00:18:07.440
(melancholic music)

00:18:08.142 --> 00:18:09.478
- Hey, I forgot to ask.

00:18:09.579 --> 00:18:10.581
When's Sachiko due?

00:18:10.681 --> 00:18:11.516
(Nana groaning)

00:18:11.616 --> 00:18:13.119
- At the end of April.

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:14.522
- Oh, my God.

00:18:14.622 --> 00:18:17.728
Imagine if she comes a few days
late and is born on May 5th.

00:18:17.828 --> 00:18:18.295
- What's wrong?

00:18:18.395 --> 00:18:19.397
It could happen, you know?

00:18:19.498 --> 00:18:21.268
If her birthday is on children's
day,

00:18:21.368 --> 00:18:22.905
then everyone will remember it.

00:18:23.005 --> 00:18:24.207
That'd be cool.

00:18:24.307 --> 00:18:26.145
- You sure it's not
the Demon Lord's child?

00:18:26.245 --> 00:18:27.147
- Don't put a curse on my baby.

00:18:27.247 --> 00:18:28.349
You know the Demon Lord's
children

00:18:28.449 --> 00:18:30.621
are only born on July the
seventh.

00:18:30.721 --> 00:18:33.092
- Let's hope so.

00:18:33.192 --> 00:18:37.267
Well, take care of yourself
and your human baby.

00:18:38.402 --> 00:18:40.641
(Nana giggling)

00:18:40.741 --> 00:18:42.110
(footsteps pattering)

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:45.617
(melancholic music)

00:18:48.757 --> 00:18:52.330
(vehicles zooming past)

00:19:01.014 --> 00:19:03.018
- Miss Hachiko's late,
isn't she?

00:19:03.119 --> 00:19:04.822
- Nope, it's only 5:30.

00:19:04.922 --> 00:19:05.891
- She doesn't have a key,

00:19:05.991 --> 00:19:08.195
so I don't think she'll
be here till 6:00.

00:19:08.295 --> 00:19:08.730
- What?

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:11.068
Why didn't she hold
onto her key?

00:19:11.168 --> 00:19:13.607
(all laughing)

00:19:13.707 --> 00:19:14.842
- That wig's too weird, Yasu.

00:19:14.942 --> 00:19:15.878
We can't even
talk to you.

00:19:15.978 --> 00:19:19.084
Mika and Masaru put all that
effort into our costumes.

00:19:19.184 --> 00:19:20.521
Why are you trying to ruin it?

00:19:20.621 --> 00:19:22.625
- You're the one who made me
wear it.

00:19:22.725 --> 00:19:23.627
You even paid for it.

00:19:23.727 --> 00:19:27.200
- Yasu has got the perfect
head for putting wigs on.

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:29.271
- Shin, quit talking
like me Misato.

00:19:29.371 --> 00:19:30.741
You're starting to turn me on.

00:19:30.841 --> 00:19:33.479
- And you look surprisingly
good with long hair, man.

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:35.183
Hachi's gonna fall for you
again.

00:19:35.283 --> 00:19:37.053
- But I don't want
her to fall in love with me

00:19:37.153 --> 00:19:38.189
for that reason.

00:19:38.289 --> 00:19:40.928
- That whole disguise kind
of makes you look like Shoji,

00:19:41.028 --> 00:19:41.863
a shorter version.

00:19:41.963 --> 00:19:44.167
- I was thinking the
same thing, mini-Shoji.

00:19:44.267 --> 00:19:45.604
- Yeah, I totally see it.

00:19:45.704 --> 00:19:47.273
Except you're way shorter.

00:19:47.373 --> 00:19:48.977
- Who is this Shoji, anyway?

00:19:49.077 --> 00:19:51.014
And how tall is he?

00:19:54.555 --> 00:19:55.557
- Shoji!

00:19:56.325 --> 00:19:59.999
(footsteps pattering)

00:20:02.538 --> 00:20:03.105
What's wrong?

00:20:03.205 --> 00:20:05.443
Your eyes are red.
- Huh?

00:20:05.544 --> 00:20:07.848
My contacts are bothering me
again.

00:20:07.948 --> 00:20:10.219
- But you don't even
wear contacts.

00:20:10.319 --> 00:20:11.355
- Hmm.

00:20:12.925 --> 00:20:14.227
I think I'm far-sighted.

00:20:14.327 --> 00:20:17.166
The further away something
is, the better I can see it.

00:20:17.267 --> 00:20:20.106
But once it gets close,
I lose sight of it.

00:20:22.878 --> 00:20:24.447
- Everyone's like that.

00:20:31.128 --> 00:20:32.463
- Come on, we'd better hold
hands,

00:20:32.565 --> 00:20:35.604
so we don't end up losing
each other in the crowd, okay?

00:20:35.704 --> 00:20:38.275
Especially 'cause you're so
tiny.

00:20:38.375 --> 00:20:41.415
(Sachiko giggling)

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:45.924
- [Nana O.] Hey, Hachi.

00:20:46.024 --> 00:20:48.697
They say you don't realize
how much you care for someone

00:20:48.797 --> 00:20:50.499
until after they're gone.

00:20:51.569 --> 00:20:53.405
But I think it's when
you come face-to-face

00:20:53.506 --> 00:20:54.675
with that person once more,

00:20:54.775 --> 00:20:57.715
that you truly recognize
your feelings for them.

00:20:58.817 --> 00:21:02.257
If I saw everyone
again right now,

00:21:02.357 --> 00:21:03.860
I know that I'd depend on them

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:06.164
just as much as I did back then.

00:21:08.235 --> 00:21:09.705
I'm scared of that.

00:21:10.974 --> 00:21:13.813
That's why I can't move
from this spot.
