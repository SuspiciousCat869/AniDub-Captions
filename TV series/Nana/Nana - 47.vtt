WEBVTT

00:00:02.661 --> 00:00:06.134
- [Nana] My dream was to
make it big with the band

00:00:06.234 --> 00:00:09.942
and become a household
name all over Japan.

00:00:10.042 --> 00:00:14.050
Even if it meant that the
one person I love the most

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.121
would never say my name again.

00:01:56.723 --> 00:01:59.327
- [Ginpei] Rehearsal starts at
noon and it'll last an hour.

00:01:59.427 --> 00:02:00.429
I got some takeout.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:01.733
If you're hungry, you better eat
now

00:02:01.833 --> 00:02:05.339
while there's still time,
you have half an hour.

00:02:07.043 --> 00:02:09.615
- It says here there's a
run through at six o'clock.

00:02:09.715 --> 00:02:10.116
What's that for?

00:02:10.216 --> 00:02:11.519
- That's when you guys play
your set

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:13.790
just like you're
gonna play on air for real.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.863
- Hmm. There's a big chunk
of time between our rehearsal

00:02:16.963 --> 00:02:18.933
and the run through,
anything we have to do then?

00:02:19.033 --> 00:02:21.639
- [Ginpei] Since this is your
first time playing live on TV,

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.444
the only thing on the
agenda today is this show.

00:02:24.545 --> 00:02:26.616
I really want you to focus.

00:02:26.716 --> 00:02:27.283
- [Nobu] What?

00:02:27.383 --> 00:02:28.853
Does that mean we're not
allowed to go out at all

00:02:28.953 --> 00:02:29.622
before the run through?

00:02:29.722 --> 00:02:31.057
- Were you even listening to me?

00:02:31.158 --> 00:02:32.694
I said, I wanted you to focus.

00:02:32.795 --> 00:02:33.495
So focus.

00:02:33.596 --> 00:02:37.738
- Listen, is it okay if I sleep
in the car during the break?

00:02:37.838 --> 00:02:39.642
I'm gonna pass out from lack
of sleep and

00:02:39.742 --> 00:02:41.779
I can't get any rest here.

00:02:50.262 --> 00:02:53.770
- [Crew Member] Great.
That'll do it.

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:57.811
- Yasu!

00:02:59.247 --> 00:03:00.449
All right. How you been doing?

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.220
- It's good to see you act like
this

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.592
even while you're on the clock.

00:03:04.692 --> 00:03:06.562
- [Reira] You big traitor.

00:03:09.635 --> 00:03:10.604
- Scary, isn't it, dude?

00:03:10.704 --> 00:03:13.375
Women never seem to
forgive or forget.

00:03:24.899 --> 00:03:27.771
- Hey, Ren, can we talk for a
minute?

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:29.575
- [Ren] What about?

00:03:29.675 --> 00:03:31.546
- [Yasu] Just come with me.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.486
Ren, are you on something again?

00:03:35.587 --> 00:03:37.156
- [Ren] Hey, it's okay.

00:03:37.256 --> 00:03:38.392
- [Yasu] No, it isn't.

00:03:38.492 --> 00:03:41.064
I can tell by your eyes.

00:03:41.164 --> 00:03:42.300
- [Ren] It's just a little,

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.870
- [Yasu] Just a little what?

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.874
- [Ren] It's not like
I gotta have it.

00:03:45.974 --> 00:03:46.474
- It already is.

00:03:46.576 --> 00:03:48.813
And you've gotta put
a stop to it.

00:03:51.117 --> 00:03:52.955
- Sorry.

00:03:53.055 --> 00:03:55.326
I'll quit, for real this time.

00:04:04.477 --> 00:04:07.450
- [Yasu] Ren, you don't have to
worry.

00:04:07.551 --> 00:04:09.755
I'm not gonna steal
Nana from you.

00:04:15.432 --> 00:04:17.403
- [Ren] I guessed you wouldn't.

00:04:19.107 --> 00:04:20.710
Since I can remember,

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.518
you've always given me
whatever I wanted.

00:04:24.618 --> 00:04:28.325
But she also looked down
on me and it pisses me off.

00:04:29.995 --> 00:04:32.133
- This is what happens
when you're not with Nana,

00:04:32.233 --> 00:04:33.836
you become so unstable.

00:04:33.937 --> 00:04:35.774
And she's the same way.

00:04:36.408 --> 00:04:37.711
- She is?

00:04:40.049 --> 00:04:43.422
- Yeah, she's been
hyperventilating.

00:04:43.523 --> 00:04:45.125
And if things keep going on like
this,

00:04:45.226 --> 00:04:47.296
who knows how
she'll end up.

00:04:47.396 --> 00:04:49.568
It all started when Hachi left.

00:04:50.537 --> 00:04:52.106
Nana was probably damaged a lot

00:04:52.206 --> 00:04:56.147
from being abandoned by her
mother when she was young.

00:04:56.248 --> 00:04:59.722
The two of you are just not
cut out for the music industry.

00:04:59.822 --> 00:05:02.226
I see now that I never
should have encouraged you

00:05:02.326 --> 00:05:03.963
to move to Tokyo.

00:05:06.702 --> 00:05:09.575
Don't force yourself anymore,
Ren.

00:05:09.675 --> 00:05:13.015
The truth is you'll
never be like me or Takumi.

00:05:13.115 --> 00:05:15.887
You've gotta stop trying to
reason everything out and just

00:05:15.987 --> 00:05:18.325
do what you want.

00:05:18.425 --> 00:05:22.734
If you keep forcing things,
you're not gonna last long.

00:05:22.834 --> 00:05:24.404
- [Mari] No matter how
many times I listen to

00:05:24.505 --> 00:05:26.709
Shadow of Love, I never
get tired of it.

00:05:26.809 --> 00:05:29.080
After tonight's show, a lot
of people are gonna feel the

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.682
same way.

00:05:29.782 --> 00:05:32.353
And when the CD hits the
shelves, it'll sell out in a
flash.

00:05:32.453 --> 00:05:34.390
- I think the sales
department overestimated

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.529
with 800,000 copies of
the single.

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:38.766
Well, I'm not gonna
take any heat if they're stuck

00:05:38.866 --> 00:05:40.069
with a bunch of leftover CDs.

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:42.507
- How many CDs do you think
Blast is gonna put out?

00:05:42.608 --> 00:05:43.008
- I don't know.

00:05:43.108 --> 00:05:44.712
- They're so hot in the news
these days,

00:05:44.812 --> 00:05:46.247
they might even break a
million.

00:05:46.348 --> 00:05:47.584
- Yeah, they've got a
certain appeal,

00:05:47.684 --> 00:05:50.222
but even Gaia wouldn't risk
putting out 800,000 copies

00:05:50.322 --> 00:05:52.961
of a single for a new
band with no track record.

00:05:53.061 --> 00:05:55.265
We'll hit number one on
the charts, for sure.

00:05:55.366 --> 00:05:56.401
- [Naoki] Totally.

00:05:56.502 --> 00:05:57.838
- Is that what you guys think?

00:05:57.938 --> 00:05:58.271
- [Naoki] Huh?

00:05:58.372 --> 00:06:01.311
- If I were Gaia, I'd try
to sell a million copies

00:06:01.411 --> 00:06:02.413
on an initial release.

00:06:02.514 --> 00:06:03.850
It's got nothing to
do with me but,

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.254
it still gives me
goosebumps

00:06:06.354 --> 00:06:08.091
- But, isn't that too
big a gamble?

00:06:08.191 --> 00:06:10.997
I mean, they've already spent
a couple hundred million yen

00:06:11.097 --> 00:06:11.666
on promotion.

00:06:11.766 --> 00:06:13.970
- But that's exactly
why they should do it.

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:17.109
Their hand was forced and they
had to invest so much already

00:06:17.209 --> 00:06:19.380
that now they have to
recoup that investment.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.850
They've gotta strike
while the iron's hot and

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:22.754
just maybe they'll
sell more than us.

00:06:22.854 --> 00:06:25.894
Imagine the attention they
get if they beat Trapnest

00:06:25.994 --> 00:06:26.662
on the charts.

00:06:26.762 --> 00:06:29.467
If you walk into a store
and there's a pile of CDs

00:06:29.568 --> 00:06:31.171
from a new band that's
just top the charts,

00:06:31.271 --> 00:06:34.545
you're gonna buy it
purely outta curiosity.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.291
- [Crew Member] Okay. Great job.

00:06:41.391 --> 00:06:43.095
- Thanks a lot, you guys.

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:44.798
- [Nobu] Hey, Ginpei.

00:06:44.898 --> 00:06:46.769
Can I go out for a bit
before the run through?

00:06:46.869 --> 00:06:48.171
- Jeez, you're persistent.

00:06:48.271 --> 00:06:49.073
Some girl you gotta be with?

00:06:49.173 --> 00:06:51.177
- You know I don't
have a girlfriend.

00:06:51.277 --> 00:06:52.781
- Good. Cause women are evil.

00:06:52.881 --> 00:06:55.620
- [Shin] Ginpei, can I
have the car keys?

00:06:56.689 --> 00:06:58.125
- [Ginpei] Are you feeling okay,
Shin?

00:06:58.225 --> 00:07:00.062
I could find an empty
dressing room for you

00:07:00.162 --> 00:07:01.131
to take a nap in.

00:07:01.231 --> 00:07:01.866
- No, that's okay.

00:07:01.966 --> 00:07:03.135
I'll sleep better in the bus.

00:07:03.235 --> 00:07:05.339
- Ginpei, why are you
so much nicer to Shin

00:07:05.439 --> 00:07:06.609
than you are to me?

00:07:06.709 --> 00:07:09.782
- [Shin] Don't come and
wake me up until it's time.

00:07:11.251 --> 00:07:13.589
- Oh, that kid has no
stamina for his age.

00:07:13.689 --> 00:07:16.327
- It's more like you've
got too much stamina.

00:07:16.428 --> 00:07:18.933
- Nana, we've got some downtime
for the next few hours,

00:07:19.033 --> 00:07:21.171
why don't you go to your
dressing room and get some rest?

00:07:21.271 --> 00:07:21.872
- Yeah, sure thing.

00:07:21.972 --> 00:07:25.045
Since I got my own room, I
should really take advantage

00:07:25.145 --> 00:07:27.718
of it and crash for
a little while.

00:07:27.818 --> 00:07:28.653
You wanna sleep with me?

00:07:28.753 --> 00:07:30.489
- Enough already.

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:31.491
- What's Nana gonna do?

00:07:31.592 --> 00:07:32.794
- [Yasu] She's going
to take a nap.

00:07:32.894 --> 00:07:34.832
- How come only the girls
get their own rooms?

00:07:34.932 --> 00:07:35.667
- [Ginpei] Cause they're evil.

00:07:35.767 --> 00:07:38.171
- What does he mean enough
already?

00:07:38.271 --> 00:07:40.777
We haven't done anything yet.

00:07:40.877 --> 00:07:44.050
How can he be so pure
and perfect all the time?

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:45.185
It's kind of boring.

00:07:45.285 --> 00:07:47.524
He's like a Buddhist monk
who's reached the state of

00:07:47.624 --> 00:07:49.360
enlightenment.

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:52.667
Maybe that means he loves
me like I'm his sister.

00:07:57.811 --> 00:08:02.019
But, Yasu's a guy, and
all guys get horny.

00:08:02.119 --> 00:08:04.858
I wonder if he jerks
off to Yuri.

00:08:09.601 --> 00:08:11.872
I haven't been with
Ren for a month.

00:08:11.972 --> 00:08:15.379
He's gotta be sleeping
with other women by now.

00:08:15.479 --> 00:08:17.316
Not that I care.

00:08:17.416 --> 00:08:18.920
I'd actually be relieved.

00:08:23.796 --> 00:08:25.900
- Welcome home, rockstar.

00:08:27.704 --> 00:08:29.073
- What are you doing here?

00:08:29.173 --> 00:08:30.008
- House sitting.

00:08:30.109 --> 00:08:32.413
I hope you don't mind
I took a cigarette.

00:08:32.514 --> 00:08:34.952
You know, it's not smart
to leave your stuff in here

00:08:35.052 --> 00:08:36.187
without locking the door.

00:08:36.287 --> 00:08:38.993
Some sketchy guy could walk in
and take whatever he wanted.

00:08:39.093 --> 00:08:40.429
- [Nana] I totally agree.

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:41.799
What if someone finds you in
here?

00:08:41.899 --> 00:08:43.503
You gotta leave, now!

00:08:43.603 --> 00:08:44.771
- Don't get mad at me.

00:08:44.872 --> 00:08:47.544
I'm sorry if you feel
that I abandoned you for a

00:08:47.644 --> 00:08:48.846
whole month.

00:08:48.946 --> 00:08:50.215
- No, I'm not mad.

00:08:50.315 --> 00:08:53.890
I mean, it's not like I made
any effort to see you either.

00:08:56.427 --> 00:08:58.231
I have to end it.

00:09:00.269 --> 00:09:02.206
Seeing each other every
now and then,

00:09:02.306 --> 00:09:05.814
and talking with each other,
making love to each other,

00:09:05.914 --> 00:09:08.920
like some couple in
a hip love drama.

00:09:10.422 --> 00:09:12.359
It just won't work for us.

00:09:13.863 --> 00:09:15.934
If we can't always be together,

00:09:16.034 --> 00:09:18.873
it'd be easier to just end it.

00:09:18.973 --> 00:09:22.346
I'm sure he'd feel the
same way if I asked him.

00:09:22.446 --> 00:09:25.219
- [Ren] Nana, there's
something I've been wanting to

00:09:25.319 --> 00:09:26.354
talk to you about.

00:09:26.454 --> 00:09:27.924
Do you have time?

00:09:29.561 --> 00:09:32.901
- [Nana] I prepared myself
for this, but I'm scared.

00:10:00.523 --> 00:10:00.990
- That was fast.

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:03.495
- Well, I was hiding behind a
row of cars,

00:10:03.596 --> 00:10:04.865
but I couldn't wait any longer.

00:10:04.965 --> 00:10:06.669
This old van bus is so cute.

00:10:06.769 --> 00:10:08.506
It stands out, so I found it
right away.

00:10:08.606 --> 00:10:11.110
You're lucky you get driven
around in a cool ride like this

00:10:11.211 --> 00:10:12.179
every day.

00:10:12.279 --> 00:10:14.685
- Yeah, but the thing is
we don't wanna stand out

00:10:14.785 --> 00:10:15.920
when we're driving around town.

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:17.691
- [Reira] But it has tinted
windows,

00:10:17.791 --> 00:10:20.162
so no one can see inside.

00:10:21.264 --> 00:10:23.401
- Then I guess you and I
can do whatever we want.

00:10:23.502 --> 00:10:25.038
- Oh, what did you have in mind?

00:10:25.138 --> 00:10:27.409
- This might be the perfect
chance to do what you wanted.

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:29.982
We could just be without
lies and pretense.

00:10:30.082 --> 00:10:32.119
- Ugh.

00:10:32.219 --> 00:10:35.994
No. How about this time we do
whatever it is you wanna do?

00:10:36.094 --> 00:10:37.029
- What I wanna do?

00:10:37.129 --> 00:10:40.469
- I'm not one of your
clients anymore, am I?

00:10:44.912 --> 00:10:46.916
- Yeah, but to tell
you the truth,

00:10:47.016 --> 00:10:48.953
what a guy like me wants
to do is pretty much

00:10:49.053 --> 00:10:52.827
the same thing that
we've already been doing.

00:10:52.928 --> 00:10:54.965
So don't worry about
doing anything for me.

00:10:55.065 --> 00:10:57.269
I'll listen to whatever
you wanna talk about.

00:10:57.369 --> 00:11:00.275
- But, you know, doing something
as a service is different

00:11:00.375 --> 00:11:03.014
than having it done for you
willingly.

00:11:12.166 --> 00:11:14.136
- [Ren] Come on, sit down.

00:11:18.913 --> 00:11:19.948
No, not over there.

00:11:20.048 --> 00:11:21.117
Why don't you come here?

00:11:21.217 --> 00:11:23.355
- What's wrong with me being
here?

00:11:23.455 --> 00:11:25.492
We're not gonna be making
out when we're having

00:11:25.593 --> 00:11:28.666
this conversation, are we?

00:11:28.766 --> 00:11:33.108
- Well then, I guess if that's
the way you want it to be.

00:11:41.792 --> 00:11:42.994
- What is it?

00:11:44.965 --> 00:11:47.036
Ren looks so thin.

00:11:47.136 --> 00:11:49.875
He probably hasn't
been eating properly.

00:12:26.047 --> 00:12:26.815
What is it?

00:12:26.915 --> 00:12:27.416
Just say it already.

00:12:27.517 --> 00:12:30.556
I feel like I'm gonna
suffocate to death.

00:12:30.656 --> 00:12:31.959
- [Ren] Marry me.

00:12:45.118 --> 00:12:47.423
- [Woman] Huh, they're shooting
something for a TV show.

00:12:47.524 --> 00:12:48.859
Wonder who's in it.

00:12:57.276 --> 00:13:00.382
- [Miu] What are you doing here,
don't you have a rehearsal?

00:13:00.482 --> 00:13:02.520
Is that supposed to be a
disguise?

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:04.256
You stick out like a sore thumb.

00:13:04.356 --> 00:13:05.358
- I've got some free time.

00:13:05.459 --> 00:13:07.597
So I thought I'd drop
by and see for myself

00:13:07.697 --> 00:13:08.699
how great an actor you are.

00:13:08.799 --> 00:13:10.636
- You know I'm just an extra,
right?

00:13:10.737 --> 00:13:12.406
- I'm loving the bank
teller outfit.

00:13:12.507 --> 00:13:14.376
You look so mature.

00:13:14.477 --> 00:13:17.116
- Why do I get the feeling
you've been hitting on me

00:13:17.216 --> 00:13:18.418
ever since this morning?

00:13:18.519 --> 00:13:20.222
- No, I didn't mean to.

00:13:20.322 --> 00:13:22.025
Well, maybe just a little.

00:13:22.126 --> 00:13:24.263
- You shouldn't tease
older women.

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:28.204
- [Nobu] No, wait.

00:13:28.304 --> 00:13:29.641
I know I probably look younger,

00:13:29.741 --> 00:13:31.845
but I'm actually 20 years old.

00:13:31.945 --> 00:13:32.446
- Oh, really?

00:13:32.547 --> 00:13:34.417
I thought you were still
a high school student.

00:13:34.518 --> 00:13:37.055
- Three months from
now I'll be turning 21.

00:13:37.156 --> 00:13:39.393
- In January? What day were
you born?

00:13:39.493 --> 00:13:40.128
- On the 23rd.

00:13:40.228 --> 00:13:41.532
- [Miu] So, you're an Aquarius.

00:13:41.632 --> 00:13:45.005
- [Nobu] Yeah. All the guys
in my band are Aquarius.

00:13:45.105 --> 00:13:46.073
- [Miu] Really?

00:13:46.174 --> 00:13:47.209
- [Nobu] You're a Virgo, right?

00:13:47.309 --> 00:13:49.748
September 22nd, blood type A.

00:13:49.848 --> 00:13:51.384
My blood type's A too.

00:13:51.484 --> 00:13:54.156
You look like you're a
teenager, but really you're 22.

00:13:54.256 --> 00:13:55.993
I was surprised when I saw your
profile

00:13:56.094 --> 00:13:56.628
on the agency's site.

00:13:56.728 --> 00:13:59.266
But if we were in school,
we'd only be one grade apart.

00:13:59.366 --> 00:14:01.805
- That's just what my profile
says.

00:14:01.905 --> 00:14:03.609
- Then, how old are you?

00:14:04.878 --> 00:14:06.214
- 27.

00:14:06.715 --> 00:14:07.550
Oh, come on.

00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:09.487
Don't die of shock or anything.

00:14:09.588 --> 00:14:10.823
- Sorry for that.

00:14:10.923 --> 00:14:12.560
- Whatever, I'm used to it.

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:14.598
I have to get back to work now.

00:14:14.698 --> 00:14:15.800
- [Nobu] Sure.

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:17.236
Well, there goes that.

00:14:17.336 --> 00:14:19.140
There's no way a 27 year old
woman

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.977
would have anything to
do with me.

00:14:21.077 --> 00:14:21.979
Even with the age difference,

00:14:22.079 --> 00:14:24.350
I bet she thinks she
can't depend on me.

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:25.118
Huh?

00:14:25.218 --> 00:14:26.889
Are these wimpy guns
strong enough for you?

00:14:26.989 --> 00:14:29.528
- Well, yeah, of course they
are.

00:14:32.199 --> 00:14:32.934
- [Nana] When I was a kid,

00:14:33.034 --> 00:14:35.438
I thought no one would
ever love me.

00:14:38.244 --> 00:14:41.652
So that winter, when I was
16 and had sex with Ren

00:14:41.752 --> 00:14:42.787
for the first time,

00:14:42.887 --> 00:14:46.895
I thought I was having the
most unbelievable dream.

00:14:46.995 --> 00:14:48.398
It didn't feel real.

00:14:50.368 --> 00:14:54.644
- [Reira] Shin. My birthday's
gonna be coming up next week.

00:14:54.744 --> 00:14:55.546
- Oh, happy birthday.

00:14:55.646 --> 00:14:58.017
- There's nothing happy
about it. I'll be 23.

00:14:58.117 --> 00:14:59.486
It makes me feel old.

00:14:59.588 --> 00:15:00.923
- 23 is still young.

00:15:01.023 --> 00:15:03.495
- But I'll be eight years older
than you.

00:15:04.698 --> 00:15:05.766
- Seven years, actually.

00:15:05.867 --> 00:15:07.670
My birthday's next week too.

00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:08.706
I'll be 16.

00:15:08.806 --> 00:15:10.075
- Huh? On what day?

00:15:10.175 --> 00:15:10.910
- November 1st.

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:13.081
I'm a Scorpio, blood type AB.

00:15:13.181 --> 00:15:14.651
- We're the same.

00:15:14.751 --> 00:15:15.252
- What? Really?

00:15:15.352 --> 00:15:18.291
- Uh-huh. It's the
red string of fate.

00:15:18.391 --> 00:15:21.798
- But you told me before that
you didn't believe in fate.

00:15:21.899 --> 00:15:24.370
- I believe it now.

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:27.409
- [Nana] To be loved by
the man I was in love with,

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:30.348
that was a miracle for me.

00:15:30.448 --> 00:15:33.589
I believed it was fate
for us to be together.

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:38.398
- [Ren] Nana.

00:15:38.498 --> 00:15:39.568
So, will you?

00:15:43.007 --> 00:15:43.976
- Again, already?

00:15:44.076 --> 00:15:45.445
You're such a horn dog.

00:15:45.546 --> 00:15:47.917
- No, I'm serious. Nana,
I need to know.

00:15:48.017 --> 00:15:49.453
Will you marry me?

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:51.758
- No way.

00:15:51.858 --> 00:15:53.027
- If you won't, I know I'll die.

00:15:53.127 --> 00:15:55.031
- Then go die by yourself.

00:15:55.131 --> 00:15:57.503
- No way. I'm
taking you with me.

00:16:05.653 --> 00:16:07.557
- Then just kill me.

00:16:15.673 --> 00:16:17.677
He nearly did kill me.

00:16:17.777 --> 00:16:20.415
And then he took me to heaven
with him.

00:16:21.183 --> 00:16:23.254
I guess I'm a pervert too.

00:16:25.158 --> 00:16:26.728
- You look a lot better, Nana.

00:16:26.828 --> 00:16:27.997
Were you able to get some sleep?

00:16:28.097 --> 00:16:29.033
- Shut up, Baldy.

00:16:29.133 --> 00:16:29.935
Just shut it.

00:16:30.035 --> 00:16:30.368
- What are you-

00:16:30.468 --> 00:16:32.339
- Because you didn't have
the guts to sleep with me,

00:16:32.439 --> 00:16:35.178
I ended up having sex
with Ren again.

00:16:35.278 --> 00:16:37.482
That fool really went too
far this time.

00:16:37.583 --> 00:16:40.422
I definitely won't marry him.

00:16:40.523 --> 00:16:42.760
- [Shin] My guess is she looks
better cause of the makeup.

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:44.229
Mika's got some real skills.

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:47.436
- No, it's all pheromones.
Ren's got the skills.

00:16:47.537 --> 00:16:48.606
When I was on my way here,

00:16:48.706 --> 00:16:50.776
I saw him coming out of
Nana's dressing room.

00:16:50.876 --> 00:16:53.481
- That's bold to do it
right in your dressing room.

00:16:53.582 --> 00:16:54.083
- No, I didn't.

00:16:54.183 --> 00:16:54.651
- This is good news.

00:16:54.751 --> 00:16:56.354
- What's so good about it,
Baldy?

00:16:56.454 --> 00:16:57.456
- You don't have to worry.

00:16:57.557 --> 00:16:59.326
In fact, you guys don't
need to sneak off to do it.

00:16:59.426 --> 00:17:01.397
The staff already knows you
two are a lovey-dovey couple.

00:17:01.497 --> 00:17:02.466
- [Nana] We are not lovey-dovey.

00:17:02.567 --> 00:17:05.038
That bastard broke into my
room before I even got there.

00:17:05.138 --> 00:17:07.710
- Nana, I know Ren tries to act
all cool

00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:09.581
but he's no different
from when he was a kid.

00:17:09.681 --> 00:17:11.985
So try to be a little nicer to
him.

00:17:12.085 --> 00:17:13.287
Please.

00:17:14.189 --> 00:17:16.127
- Now I get it.

00:17:16.227 --> 00:17:18.097
The reason Yasu's
always turned down

00:17:18.197 --> 00:17:19.266
the chance to sleep with me

00:17:19.366 --> 00:17:21.470
is not cause he is
a Buddhist monk,

00:17:21.571 --> 00:17:24.844
or cause he thinks of
me as his little sister.

00:17:24.944 --> 00:17:26.581
- [Naoki] Yasu!

00:17:26.682 --> 00:17:29.621
- It's simply because
I'm Ren's girlfriend.

00:17:32.794 --> 00:17:37.035
Why didn't I ever notice
something so obvious before?

00:17:37.135 --> 00:17:38.104
- This is like a class reunion.

00:17:38.204 --> 00:17:39.507
- [Yasu] An unexpected
one in many-

00:17:39.607 --> 00:17:41.978
- [Nana] The reason Yasu
sacrifices himself to protect me

00:17:42.079 --> 00:17:43.982
is because Ren's not
capable of doing it himself.

00:17:44.083 --> 00:17:45.886
- You just wanted to see
me, right Yasu?

00:17:45.986 --> 00:17:47.657
- [Nana] He does it for Ren.

00:17:47.757 --> 00:17:49.928
Yasu's bond with Ren is
much stronger

00:17:50.028 --> 00:17:52.466
than the one he has with me.

00:17:52.567 --> 00:17:55.271
They've been friends
since Ren was born.

00:17:56.374 --> 00:17:58.311
In the same orphanage.

00:18:01.752 --> 00:18:04.089
The last thread of hope
I was holding on to

00:18:04.189 --> 00:18:06.561
never actually existed.

00:18:06.661 --> 00:18:10.301
No one can save me from the
pain of drowning in Ren's love.

00:18:11.337 --> 00:18:13.341
Only Ren can save me.

00:18:16.982 --> 00:18:18.251
It's my fate.

00:18:18.351 --> 00:18:19.854
I can't escape it.

00:18:27.537 --> 00:18:29.974
- Hey Nobu, you doing okay?

00:18:30.075 --> 00:18:30.475
- Yeah.

00:18:30.576 --> 00:18:34.349
- [Nana] Why does this guy's
mere presence spell trouble.

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:36.087
His very existence is evil.

00:18:36.187 --> 00:18:38.124
He has to be the demon lord.

00:18:38.224 --> 00:18:38.759
- Long time no see, Nobu.

00:18:38.859 --> 00:18:39.761
- Your woman's getting
weirder and weirder, man.

00:18:39.861 --> 00:18:41.197
- Same to you, Shin.
How's it going?

00:18:41.297 --> 00:18:44.236
- Yeah. It's been a while,
Reira.

00:18:44.336 --> 00:18:47.409
- [Nana] There she is,
the diva herself. Reira.

00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:50.883
Well, I'm here too,
on the same stage.

00:18:50.983 --> 00:18:52.754
And she's looking right at me.

00:18:54.123 --> 00:18:55.325
She's coming.

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:56.962
She's coming.

00:18:57.830 --> 00:19:01.237
She's coming.

00:19:01.337 --> 00:19:03.241
- It's so great to
finally meet you, Nana.

00:19:03.341 --> 00:19:04.711
I'm Reira from Trapnest.

00:19:04.811 --> 00:19:06.347
I hope we become BFFs.

00:19:06.447 --> 00:19:08.384
- Me too.

00:19:08.484 --> 00:19:11.157
Note to self, never
underestimate this woman.

00:19:11.257 --> 00:19:13.294
- That's the biggest TV I've
ever seen.

00:19:13.394 --> 00:19:15.098
- [Hachi] Yeah. I convinced
Takumi me to buy me

00:19:15.198 --> 00:19:16.133
the biggest one in the store.

00:19:16.233 --> 00:19:17.804
I had to rearrange
the room around it.

00:19:17.904 --> 00:19:19.841
- Don't you think you're
going a little overboard

00:19:19.941 --> 00:19:20.308
with everything?

00:19:20.408 --> 00:19:23.214
You do realize how spoiled
you are, don't you?

00:19:23.314 --> 00:19:24.450
- That's actually not true.

00:19:24.551 --> 00:19:26.086
He's really strict with me.

00:19:26.187 --> 00:19:27.289
He tells me if I don't behave,

00:19:27.389 --> 00:19:29.928
he won't blow dry my
hair after I take a bath.

00:19:30.028 --> 00:19:31.731
- Then blow dry it yourself.

00:19:31.832 --> 00:19:34.303
- [Hachi] I can't wait for
it to be eight o'clock.

00:19:34.403 --> 00:19:35.739
We still have two hours to wait.

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:38.311
- Watching the clock won't
make time go any faster.

00:19:38.411 --> 00:19:40.115
So in the meantime, are
you hungry?

00:19:40.215 --> 00:19:40.850
Let's get some
takeout.

00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:43.221
- Hey, if salad and
pasta sound cool to you

00:19:43.321 --> 00:19:44.289
I can whip something up.

00:19:44.389 --> 00:19:46.160
I made lots of sauce
with the tomatoes

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:47.462
your parents sent from home.

00:19:47.563 --> 00:19:49.734
- Wow. It seems you've
changed your expertise from

00:19:49.834 --> 00:19:52.740
falling in love with guys at
first sight to cooking sauces.

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:54.343
- [Hachi] I'm really into
cooking lately.

00:19:54.443 --> 00:19:55.478
I'm not nauseous anymore,

00:19:55.579 --> 00:19:57.349
so I was thinking of
taking a class.

00:19:57.449 --> 00:19:59.521
I wanna be an Iron Chef
like on TV.

00:19:59.621 --> 00:20:01.758
- Well, if anything, now you
found something you're good at.

00:20:01.858 --> 00:20:04.029
Perhaps coming to Tokyo
was worth it in the end.

00:20:04.129 --> 00:20:06.701
- But you know, I've
realized if I lived on my own

00:20:06.802 --> 00:20:09.607
I wouldn't have gotten as
good at cooking as I am now.

00:20:09.707 --> 00:20:12.045
I really don't like to
cook just for myself.

00:20:12.145 --> 00:20:13.347
- Yeah. I know what you mean.

00:20:13.447 --> 00:20:15.385
- I think what I enjoy
the most about cooking

00:20:15.485 --> 00:20:17.957
is being able to see
people enjoying my food.

00:20:18.057 --> 00:20:20.763
It makes me feel happy
and you know, useful.

00:20:20.863 --> 00:20:23.267
Plus, Nana's cooking was
always way too salty.

00:20:23.367 --> 00:20:24.236
Everybody complained about it,

00:20:24.336 --> 00:20:26.240
so I had to cook
almost every day.

00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:27.743
Cause of that,
I got better at it.

00:20:27.844 --> 00:20:30.916
I mean too much salt has got
to be bad for your health.

00:20:31.016 --> 00:20:33.789
- Then I guess it's
all thanks to the guru.

00:20:33.889 --> 00:20:34.189
- Huh?

00:20:34.289 --> 00:20:36.160
- [Junko] Nana's also the one
who introduced you to Takumi,

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:36.995
right?

00:20:37.095 --> 00:20:38.532
Now look where that's led you.

00:20:41.972 --> 00:20:44.243
You talk a lot about your
good memories, but you know

00:20:44.343 --> 00:20:46.648
I've never seen you as
happy as you are now.

00:20:46.748 --> 00:20:50.121
It seems you finally have
both feet on the ground.

00:20:50.221 --> 00:20:51.457
It's a relief.

00:20:52.425 --> 00:20:55.298
- [Nana] Hey Hachi, back then,

00:20:55.398 --> 00:20:57.002
I was full of deep regret.

00:20:57.102 --> 00:21:00.776
Because I was the one who
introduced you to Takumi.

00:21:03.014 --> 00:21:07.289
But if you're still with
him now, and you're happy

00:21:07.389 --> 00:21:09.459
that makes me feel better.

00:21:11.631 --> 00:21:14.336
It's my last ray of hope.
