00:00:01.971 --> 00:00:02.873
(gentle music)

00:00:03.988 --> 00:00:07.762
- That night I waited for Nana
to reply to my text message.

00:00:07.862 --> 00:00:11.469
I got more and more worried
as the night went on.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.243
Once it got past midnight,
I couldn't take it anymore.

00:00:15.343 --> 00:00:17.515
I grabbed my cell
phone to call her.

00:00:17.615 --> 00:00:21.055
And right then my phone
beeped with a new message.

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:26.098
It was from her.

00:00:26.833 --> 00:00:30.240
(upbeat rock music)

00:02:06.833 --> 00:02:11.075
- [Reira] You know, I'm
really half Japanese.

00:02:11.175 --> 00:02:13.179
My dad was American.

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:15.483
He got sick and died when I was
six.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.425
Whenever people find
out I'm half American,

00:02:19.526 --> 00:02:21.596
they suddenly start
thinking I'm beautiful

00:02:21.697 --> 00:02:22.732
because of that,

00:02:22.832 --> 00:02:26.372
like, that's why I have
a good singing voice.

00:02:26.472 --> 00:02:29.078
So my agency said I
should keep it a secret

00:02:29.178 --> 00:02:29.713
and impress the public

00:02:29.813 --> 00:02:33.252
by letting them think I'm
just the same as they are.

00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.294
I don't really care either way

00:02:37.394 --> 00:02:39.431
just as long as I get to sing.

00:02:40.668 --> 00:02:42.939
People are always telling
me how I should act,

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:44.241
what I should say.

00:02:44.341 --> 00:02:46.747
They're afraid I'm gonna say
something

00:02:46.847 --> 00:02:48.817
that'll ruin my image,

00:02:48.917 --> 00:02:50.855
but there's no image to ruin.

00:02:50.955 --> 00:02:52.558
I am who I am.

00:02:57.367 --> 00:02:59.171
It's hard to be human.

00:03:02.812 --> 00:03:05.985
The next day it rained like
crazy.

00:03:06.085 --> 00:03:09.491
The supermarket where I
was working was deserted.

00:03:10.694 --> 00:03:12.865
No one was taking my
samples of Gyoza

00:03:12.965 --> 00:03:16.105
and the smell made my
hair and clothes wreak.

00:03:16.205 --> 00:03:17.975
I thought I was gonna lose it.

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:23.620
- [Shin] What a surprise, you
didn't go through with it.

00:03:23.721 --> 00:03:24.622
- Shut up, Shin!

00:03:24.723 --> 00:03:27.260
It's possible Hachi
might have a clue

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.198
about your feelings for her,

00:03:29.298 --> 00:03:31.235
but unless you confess the whole
truth,

00:03:31.335 --> 00:03:33.674
you're just leaving her
hanging there wondering.

00:03:33.774 --> 00:03:36.245
- But what if I tell her
and it scares her off.

00:03:36.345 --> 00:03:38.817
- These matches are useless.

00:03:38.917 --> 00:03:39.886
Hey, you got a light?

00:03:39.986 --> 00:03:40.855
- I don't smoke.

00:03:40.955 --> 00:03:42.457
What happened to the big,
lighter of yours

00:03:42.558 --> 00:03:44.094
that you used to wear around
your neck?

00:03:44.194 --> 00:03:45.263
I thought the point of wearing
it

00:03:45.363 --> 00:03:47.568
was so that you wouldn't lose
it.

00:03:48.236 --> 00:03:49.037
- Yeah, don't remind me.

00:03:49.138 --> 00:03:50.975
I really liked that lighter.

00:03:51.075 --> 00:03:52.210
It was vintage.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.148
I'm never gonna be able to
replace it.

00:03:54.248 --> 00:03:55.283
- Well, that's karma.

00:03:55.383 --> 00:03:58.322
The demon lord's getting
his revenge on you.

00:03:58.423 --> 00:04:00.561
- Yeah, probably.

00:04:00.661 --> 00:04:02.297
- Huh?

00:04:02.397 --> 00:04:03.767
- Hey, Yasu!

00:04:03.867 --> 00:04:04.401
- [Yasu] Where's Nana?

00:04:04.502 --> 00:04:05.236
- She's not here yet.

00:04:05.336 --> 00:04:07.608
So how'd it go with the record
company?

00:04:07.708 --> 00:04:08.877
- I'll tell you when Nana gets
here.

00:04:08.977 --> 00:04:10.280
- Come on, tell us.

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.716
- What are you talking about?

00:04:11.817 --> 00:04:12.718
- Oh yeah, Shin,

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.390
I called your cell phone last
night but you didn't answer.

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.762
I was starting to get
worried about you.

00:04:17.862 --> 00:04:18.697
- Hmm.

00:04:18.797 --> 00:04:21.302
- So it's good to see
you're here alive and well.

00:04:21.402 --> 00:04:22.772
- You were out getting some?

00:04:22.872 --> 00:04:24.976
Dude, shouldn't you
slow that down.

00:04:25.076 --> 00:04:27.280
- It's just business.

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.351
- Don't call that business!

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.455
- Yasu, how'd it go?

00:04:31.556 --> 00:04:32.525
What did they say?

00:04:32.625 --> 00:04:35.764
- Would someone tell me what's
going on?

00:04:35.865 --> 00:04:37.835
(cricket singing)

00:04:37.935 --> 00:04:39.037
- A scout!

00:04:41.108 --> 00:04:42.444
Wait, wait a minute.

00:04:42.545 --> 00:04:43.279
Take a deep breath.

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:44.381
Oh my God.

00:04:44.481 --> 00:04:44.916
Calm down, Nana.

00:04:45.016 --> 00:04:46.887
- You're the one who needs to
calm down.

00:04:48.557 --> 00:04:49.692
- Okay, I'm ready now.

00:04:49.792 --> 00:04:52.030
You're going to tell me
everything that happened.

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:53.032
- Am I?

00:04:53.132 --> 00:04:53.901
It's simple.

00:04:54.001 --> 00:04:56.272
What happened was we sent
a demo tape and a video

00:04:56.372 --> 00:04:59.679
of our last concert to a few
different record companies.

00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:00.614
- Yeah.

00:05:00.714 --> 00:05:01.516
- One of them liked what they
saw

00:05:01.616 --> 00:05:03.654
and contacted us to
say they're interested.

00:05:03.754 --> 00:05:04.956
- Yeah, yeah.

00:05:05.056 --> 00:05:06.660
- It was Gaia music.

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.398
- (gasps) That's a famous label!

00:05:09.498 --> 00:05:09.966
Even I've heard of them.

00:05:10.066 --> 00:05:12.404
- Yeah, well they're
only the biggest in town.

00:05:12.505 --> 00:05:14.474
- You're gonna sign with them?

00:05:16.345 --> 00:05:17.915
- No, not yet, we've got a ways
to go.

00:05:18.015 --> 00:05:18.984
- No, aww!

00:05:19.084 --> 00:05:22.758
- Yasu had a meeting with
someone from Gaia today.

00:05:22.859 --> 00:05:24.696
Apparently, he wants
to come to our next gig

00:05:24.796 --> 00:05:26.633
so he can see us perform in
person.

00:05:26.733 --> 00:05:27.902
And if we do really well with
that,

00:05:28.002 --> 00:05:30.406
then he is gonna seriously
consider signing us.

00:05:30.507 --> 00:05:31.275
- Well, that's great.

00:05:31.375 --> 00:05:33.079
Once he's seen you, you
guys have got it made.

00:05:33.179 --> 00:05:34.281
He's gonna love you.

00:05:34.381 --> 00:05:35.951
You guys rock when you play
live.

00:05:36.051 --> 00:05:36.586
- You're right.

00:05:36.686 --> 00:05:38.690
We've got this one in the bag.

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:39.726
Total victory.

00:05:39.826 --> 00:05:42.965
- (chuckles) Victory, I
guess you could call it that.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.436
So when's your next show?

00:05:45.538 --> 00:05:47.207
It's at the end of the month,
isn't it?

00:05:47.307 --> 00:05:48.309
- Yeah, on the 28th.

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:50.280
- Then we'd better let Misato
know.

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.518
- You should have come
to the practice today.

00:05:52.618 --> 00:05:55.023
Everyone was so pumped,
especially Nobuo.

00:05:55.123 --> 00:05:57.227
His guitar strings kept breaking

00:05:57.327 --> 00:05:57.762
(Hachi laughing)

00:05:57.862 --> 00:06:00.868
- One of these days,
I'll show him, Takami.

00:06:05.176 --> 00:06:10.086
- You should have dropped
by the studio after work.

00:06:10.186 --> 00:06:11.690
- Um, Nana.

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:12.490
- Huh?

00:06:12.592 --> 00:06:15.864
- Yesterday or the day before
yesterday.

00:06:15.965 --> 00:06:20.975
I, anyway, it was the night of
the last trap nest concert.

00:06:21.075 --> 00:06:24.882
Takumi came over here
afterwards and...

00:06:24.983 --> 00:06:25.618
- Yeah, I know.

00:06:25.718 --> 00:06:26.485
I saw you guys kissing

00:06:26.586 --> 00:06:28.489
and getting all grabby with
each other.

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:29.726
I tried to say something to
you,

00:06:29.826 --> 00:06:32.565
but you didn't seem to
notice I was there.

00:06:32.665 --> 00:06:35.403
- She saw us, I'm sorry.

00:06:35.504 --> 00:06:36.205
- Huh?

00:06:36.305 --> 00:06:36.773
What for?

00:06:36.873 --> 00:06:38.577
- I wasn't really thinking
straight.

00:06:38.677 --> 00:06:40.380
It all happened so fast.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.816
I hope it didn't weird you out.

00:06:41.917 --> 00:06:45.624
I mean, I probably should
have told you sooner.

00:06:45.724 --> 00:06:48.931
- Well, I was surprised, but
you don't have to apologize.

00:06:49.031 --> 00:06:50.901
- It's just since Takumi came
over

00:06:51.001 --> 00:06:52.538
after all the parties
had finished,

00:06:52.638 --> 00:06:54.374
I assumed you'd gone over to
see Ren

00:06:54.474 --> 00:06:55.744
to spend the night with him.

00:06:55.844 --> 00:06:57.414
But then later I thought
that maybe you left

00:06:57.515 --> 00:06:59.284
because of me and Takumi me
being here.

00:06:59.384 --> 00:07:02.190
So I felt really bad.

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:03.225
- Nah, that's not it.

00:07:03.326 --> 00:07:04.428
I got a text from Ren.

00:07:04.529 --> 00:07:06.031
So I went over to his place.

00:07:06.131 --> 00:07:07.033
- Really?

00:07:07.133 --> 00:07:08.169
Thank goodness.

00:07:08.269 --> 00:07:09.037
But I remember you telling me

00:07:09.137 --> 00:07:10.874
you weren't gonna let Ren stay
over here

00:07:10.975 --> 00:07:12.277
'cause you didn't want me to
feel

00:07:12.377 --> 00:07:13.680
like I was getting in the way.

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:15.584
I should be doing the same for
you.

00:07:15.684 --> 00:07:16.853
- Nah, it's cool with me.

00:07:16.953 --> 00:07:19.191
Actually, I think I
might be staying at Ren's

00:07:19.291 --> 00:07:20.828
for a while anyway.

00:07:20.928 --> 00:07:21.896
- What?

00:07:21.997 --> 00:07:22.798
- Want one?

00:07:22.898 --> 00:07:26.438
- Sure, so are you like
moving in with him?

00:07:26.539 --> 00:07:27.541
- No, just for the two weeks

00:07:27.642 --> 00:07:29.277
before Trapnest goes
back on tour.

00:07:29.378 --> 00:07:31.850
They don't get many
opportunities to take time off.

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:34.856
So I wanna spend as much
time with him as I can.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:41.736
- Right, of course, she
wants to be with Ren.

00:07:44.141 --> 00:07:47.080
- So go ahead and invite
Takumi me over here every day,

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:47.748
if you want.

00:07:47.848 --> 00:07:49.786
You'll pretty much have
the place to yourself.

00:07:49.886 --> 00:07:51.422
- He can't come over every day.

00:07:51.523 --> 00:07:53.560
He told me he's busy
with lots of things.

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:55.597
Even when it's his day off.

00:07:56.265 --> 00:07:58.369
Unless he's lying to me.

00:07:58.469 --> 00:08:01.141
- I don't think he's lying,
I think he really is busy.

00:08:01.241 --> 00:08:03.714
Remember they only just
got back from their tour.

00:08:03.814 --> 00:08:05.483
So he's probably got a
million different things

00:08:05.584 --> 00:08:07.454
to catch up on now that
he's home again.

00:08:07.555 --> 00:08:10.460
Ren told me something
like that too.

00:08:10.561 --> 00:08:11.428
- I guess you're right.

00:08:11.529 --> 00:08:13.567
- Yeah, it's gonna be fine.

00:08:13.667 --> 00:08:16.238
He'll be here to see you again.

00:08:16.338 --> 00:08:17.040
- To be honest,

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:20.914
I never expected you to be
so cool about me and Takumi.

00:08:21.014 --> 00:08:24.856
That's why I couldn't bring
myself to tell you before.

00:08:25.591 --> 00:08:26.860
I'm really sorry.

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:27.895
- What for?

00:08:27.995 --> 00:08:31.135
- I was afraid you'd
think I was being stupid.

00:08:31.235 --> 00:08:32.303
- Stupid?

00:08:32.404 --> 00:08:35.677
- Because I'm a fan sleeping
with a rock star or whatever.

00:08:35.778 --> 00:08:38.583
When you look at it like
that, it is stupid, isn't it?

00:08:38.683 --> 00:08:40.854
Even I think it's
kind of stupid.

00:08:40.954 --> 00:08:42.625
- Would you listen to yourself?

00:08:42.725 --> 00:08:44.562
So what if Takumi happens
to be a member

00:08:44.662 --> 00:08:45.931
of a hugely popular band.

00:08:46.031 --> 00:08:47.000
That doesn't matter to you

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:49.972
now that you've fallen
in love with him, right?

00:08:51.208 --> 00:08:53.079
- It doesn't matter.

00:08:53.179 --> 00:08:55.918
Yeah, or maybe it does.

00:08:56.018 --> 00:08:59.992
In my mind, I can't really
separate Takumi from Trapnest.

00:09:00.093 --> 00:09:02.965
I've never thought of him
as being anything else.

00:09:03.065 --> 00:09:06.205
But if I think of him
as just some guy,

00:09:06.305 --> 00:09:08.877
he seems like he might be
a total jerk.

00:09:08.977 --> 00:09:12.183
- You know, I've got no time for
people who try and sleep

00:09:12.283 --> 00:09:14.387
with celebrities just so
they can brag about it

00:09:14.488 --> 00:09:16.492
to their friends.

00:09:16.593 --> 00:09:18.329
But when I saw you in his arms

00:09:18.429 --> 00:09:21.435
and I saw the tears rolling
down your cheeks as he held you,

00:09:21.536 --> 00:09:23.974
no way I could think
that was stupid.

00:09:24.909 --> 00:09:26.245
I'm sure even a guy like Takumi

00:09:26.345 --> 00:09:28.382
would've understood that
those tears of yours

00:09:28.482 --> 00:09:30.754
came straight from the heart.

00:09:30.854 --> 00:09:34.327
And if he didn't feel that,
he would've pulled away,

00:09:34.428 --> 00:09:35.764
probably wondering what
kind of mess

00:09:35.864 --> 00:09:37.300
he'd gotten himself into.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.204
So it's gonna be all right.

00:09:39.304 --> 00:09:41.141
Just be yourself.

00:09:46.619 --> 00:09:49.491
Some of the guys might say
stuff to you about Takumi,

00:09:49.592 --> 00:09:51.061
but that's only because they're
worried.

00:09:51.161 --> 00:09:53.767
Especially Yasu, he's always
worrying.

00:09:53.867 --> 00:09:55.169
Don't let them get to you.

00:09:55.269 --> 00:09:57.508
- By the way Nana, while
we're on the subject.

00:09:57.608 --> 00:09:58.409
- Huh?

00:09:58.510 --> 00:09:59.144
On what subject?

00:09:59.244 --> 00:10:02.785
- Did you tell anyone about me
in Takumi?

00:10:02.885 --> 00:10:07.494
You know that you saw us like
together?

00:10:07.595 --> 00:10:11.335
- I'm sorry, I did mention it
to Yasu, was that bad of me?

00:10:11.435 --> 00:10:14.575
- Yasu's fine, Nobuo's
the one I'm worried about.

00:10:14.675 --> 00:10:17.280
Do you think Yasu would've said
anything?

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:18.717
- No, Nobuo and Shin found out

00:10:18.817 --> 00:10:21.121
when Takumi was talking
about it at the party.

00:10:21.221 --> 00:10:21.923
(Hachi gasping)

00:10:22.023 --> 00:10:25.496
- Takumi said she was wagging
her tail like a puppy duck.

00:10:25.597 --> 00:10:27.100
Then Nobuo, freaked.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:27.735
- What the hell?

00:10:27.835 --> 00:10:28.803
- Hang on, he didn't mean it.

00:10:28.904 --> 00:10:32.243
He was just being
thoughtless, but you know,

00:10:32.343 --> 00:10:35.283
I'm surprised he went back
to see Hachi after that,

00:10:35.383 --> 00:10:37.788
He usually hates getting
seriously involved

00:10:37.888 --> 00:10:39.525
with any of the women he dates.

00:10:39.625 --> 00:10:41.295
She threw a drink at him.

00:10:41.395 --> 00:10:42.363
I thought that'd be it.

00:10:42.463 --> 00:10:44.635
He'd never want to have
anything to do with her again.

00:10:44.735 --> 00:10:46.004
But this time's different,

00:10:46.104 --> 00:10:48.108
maybe this time he really likes
her.

00:10:48.209 --> 00:10:51.783
- So what exactly did
Takumi say at the party?

00:10:52.985 --> 00:10:55.524
- Well, Ren said that Takumi
told the guys

00:10:55.624 --> 00:10:57.828
that he was going out with you.

00:10:58.964 --> 00:11:00.132
- Going out with me?

00:11:00.233 --> 00:11:01.970
Oh, I bet he stood there all
calm and cool

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:04.474
like he always does and said
to them, I did it with her.

00:11:04.575 --> 00:11:05.878
Like it was some big joke.

00:11:05.978 --> 00:11:07.648
- You know him well then.

00:11:07.748 --> 00:11:09.017
You mentioned Nobuo just now.

00:11:09.117 --> 00:11:11.221
Why are you worried about what
he thinks?

00:11:11.321 --> 00:11:12.791
Is something going on?

00:11:17.668 --> 00:11:20.106
- Well, last night,

00:11:20.206 --> 00:11:22.912
Nobuo came over saying he needed
to talk.

00:11:23.012 --> 00:11:25.349
He said he was gonna be
better than Takumi

00:11:25.449 --> 00:11:27.588
or it was something like that.

00:11:27.688 --> 00:11:29.725
I didn't really get what he
meant by it,

00:11:29.825 --> 00:11:30.259
but now...

00:11:30.359 --> 00:11:33.833
- Ah, he came to confess
his undying love for you.

00:11:33.934 --> 00:11:34.769
- Do you really think so?

00:11:34.869 --> 00:11:37.307
But he never actually said
he was in love with me.

00:11:37.407 --> 00:11:39.110
- He probably couldn't
bring himself to say it,

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:41.481
but everyone can tell
he's got a thing for you.

00:11:41.583 --> 00:11:43.687
It's so obvious.

00:11:43.787 --> 00:11:45.757
- Aww, how can I be so dense?

00:11:45.857 --> 00:11:46.960
I had no idea.

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:48.195
What am I gonna do?

00:11:48.295 --> 00:11:50.968
- So, is that why you
didn't come to the studio

00:11:51.068 --> 00:11:52.370
for rehearsal today?

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:53.439
- Yeah.

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:54.909
- There's no need to freak out.

00:11:55.009 --> 00:11:58.015
There really isn't anything
you can do about it anyway.

00:11:58.115 --> 00:11:59.986
You're in love with Takumi.

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:04.762
- But finding true love.

00:12:04.862 --> 00:12:05.429
I love stories like that.

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:07.901
- I like all that
slushy stuff too.

00:12:08.002 --> 00:12:09.104
I'm a romantic at heart,

00:12:09.204 --> 00:12:11.909
till then, I'm happy with a
few distractions along the way.

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:12.878
I should never have come.

00:12:12.978 --> 00:12:14.615
I can't compete with him.

00:12:14.715 --> 00:12:16.285
What was I thinking?

00:12:16.385 --> 00:12:18.657
I can't just leave it
like this between us.

00:12:18.757 --> 00:12:20.426
I feel like I've gotta do
something.

00:12:20.527 --> 00:12:23.032
- In that case, don't just sit
there mumbling to yourself.

00:12:23.132 --> 00:12:24.902
Get off your butt and
go talk to her.

00:12:25.002 --> 00:12:27.206
If Hachi never comes to
one of our rehearsals again

00:12:27.307 --> 00:12:29.745
because of this, it's
gonna be all your fault.

00:12:29.845 --> 00:12:30.681
- Fine, I'll go and see her,

00:12:30.781 --> 00:12:32.383
but it's probably
a waste of time.

00:12:32.483 --> 00:12:34.755
It's like I'm on a suicide
mission or something.

00:12:34.855 --> 00:12:36.191
- Suicide mission?

00:12:36.291 --> 00:12:36.960
- Damn it!

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:40.232
I wish there was just one thing
I was better at than Takumi.

00:12:40.333 --> 00:12:40.767
- There is one.

00:12:40.867 --> 00:12:42.604
- Really?

00:12:42.705 --> 00:12:43.640
- Oh, hold on a second.

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:46.612
(phone ringing)

00:12:46.713 --> 00:12:47.982
- Not answering?

00:12:48.817 --> 00:12:49.752
- I gotta go.

00:12:49.852 --> 00:12:51.321
- Business again?

00:12:51.421 --> 00:12:53.058
Don't get arrested.

00:12:55.897 --> 00:12:59.639
Hey, you can't just steal my
clothes,

00:12:59.739 --> 00:13:01.943
especially my best jacket.

00:13:03.012 --> 00:13:06.051
Wait, Shin, you never
answered my question.

00:13:06.151 --> 00:13:09.190
What's the one thing I've got
over Takumi?

00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:10.326
- You love her.

00:13:14.568 --> 00:13:15.737
(car engine revving)

00:13:15.837 --> 00:13:18.409
- Hey, it's Shin.

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:22.818
Yeah, yeah, I should
have been more careful.

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:26.559
You mind if I come and
pick it up now?

00:13:27.661 --> 00:13:30.801
(door unlocking)

00:13:33.573 --> 00:13:36.979
(door bell ringing)

00:13:57.988 --> 00:14:01.495
- You left it on purpose, didn't
you?

00:14:02.564 --> 00:14:03.600
- Hmm.

00:14:04.535 --> 00:14:06.238
- Get in here.

00:14:11.248 --> 00:14:12.450
- Reira.

00:14:12.551 --> 00:14:13.586
- Hmm?

00:14:14.855 --> 00:14:16.491
- Pay in advance.

00:14:18.195 --> 00:14:21.502
(water splashing)

00:14:45.584 --> 00:14:49.057
- [Hachi] Down by the river,
I could hear Nana singing.

00:14:49.157 --> 00:14:51.094
Her voice carried by the wind.

00:14:51.194 --> 00:14:53.132
It was the same song that Nobuo
played

00:14:53.232 --> 00:14:55.136
the day he came to Tokyo.

00:14:55.236 --> 00:14:57.240
I love that song.

00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:59.678
It's my all time favorite.

00:15:05.222 --> 00:15:08.997
- Listen to her, Ms. Yamada
is probably gonna come out

00:15:09.097 --> 00:15:10.834
and yell at you guys again.

00:15:10.934 --> 00:15:14.240
(Hachi chuckling)

00:15:19.685 --> 00:15:22.023
I'm sorry about yesterday.

00:15:22.123 --> 00:15:23.425
I shouldn't have barged in on
you

00:15:23.526 --> 00:15:26.097
and I said all those weird
things.

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:30.072
Anyway, now that I have the
chance,

00:15:30.172 --> 00:15:32.477
I'm gonna come straight to the
point.

00:15:48.776 --> 00:15:50.647
I'm in love with you.

00:15:50.747 --> 00:15:53.586
(gentle music)

00:15:58.830 --> 00:16:00.834
- I'm sorry, but that
wasn't what I had in mind

00:16:00.934 --> 00:16:01.903
when I asked you to come in.

00:16:02.003 --> 00:16:04.440
- Then I've got no
reason to be here.

00:16:04.542 --> 00:16:06.646
- Don't you want your
lighter back?

00:16:06.746 --> 00:16:08.448
- No, you keep it.

00:16:23.011 --> 00:16:25.617
- I'm sorry, Shin, you
can have it back.

00:16:25.717 --> 00:16:27.420
Just don't be mad at me.

00:16:31.394 --> 00:16:33.933
- I lied about charging
100,000 a night.

00:16:34.033 --> 00:16:34.902
- Huh?

00:16:35.002 --> 00:16:37.507
- Well, there are times I
have to charge more than that,

00:16:37.608 --> 00:16:42.316
but I've never had someone
hand me 100,000 in cash before.

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:45.189
It was the first time you've
ever done

00:16:45.289 --> 00:16:46.926
anything like that, wasn't it?

00:16:47.026 --> 00:16:49.163
At first, I really fell
for your bad girl act.

00:16:49.264 --> 00:16:51.201
But once I get in bed with a
woman,

00:16:51.301 --> 00:16:53.138
it's easy for me to tell
if she's got a history

00:16:53.238 --> 00:16:54.307
of sleeping around.

00:16:54.407 --> 00:16:57.146
So you don't have to pretend
anymore.

00:16:57.246 --> 00:16:59.652
I feel bad that I took 100,000
Yen

00:16:59.752 --> 00:17:00.419
from you like that.

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:04.193
So I figure I owe you at
least one more night with me.

00:17:04.294 --> 00:17:06.131
Call me when you want it.

00:17:07.701 --> 00:17:10.540
Goodnight, Reira, and
sweet dreams.

00:17:11.207 --> 00:17:14.247
(gentle music)

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:32.751
- My heart is confused.

00:17:34.053 --> 00:17:35.824
I feel like I'm falling,

00:17:41.101 --> 00:17:43.405
maybe I've made a big mistake.

00:17:47.681 --> 00:17:50.386
- It's probably not fair
of me to tell you all this,

00:17:50.486 --> 00:17:53.091
because I know it's not
gonna make any difference.

00:17:53.191 --> 00:17:56.431
You see, I know about
you and Takami.

00:17:56.532 --> 00:17:58.670
- [Hachi] I wish he didn't know.

00:18:00.205 --> 00:18:02.644
- You're in love with him,
aren't you?

00:18:03.746 --> 00:18:05.583
- I wish nobody knew.

00:18:08.355 --> 00:18:12.597
I wonder, am I really
in love with Takami,

00:18:13.766 --> 00:18:15.937
or maybe I'm just trying
to justify the fact

00:18:16.037 --> 00:18:17.641
that I slept with him?

00:18:23.987 --> 00:18:25.657
I don't know anymore.

00:18:29.297 --> 00:18:31.401
- I'm sorry,

00:18:31.502 --> 00:18:36.077
you avoided the studio today,
it was because of me, right?

00:18:36.177 --> 00:18:37.113
- No, that's not it.

00:18:37.213 --> 00:18:38.616
I didn't come because I
had to work today.

00:18:38.716 --> 00:18:39.685
- Well, I just wanted you to
know.

00:18:39.785 --> 00:18:41.254
You don't have to worry about
me.

00:18:41.354 --> 00:18:42.891
You should keep coming
to rehearsals.

00:18:42.991 --> 00:18:45.262
Everyone really misses
you when you aren't there.

00:18:45.362 --> 00:18:48.235
Actually, I'm the
one who misses you.

00:18:50.239 --> 00:18:51.575
- Thanks, Nobuo.

00:18:53.011 --> 00:18:55.149
- Well, that's a relief.

00:18:56.686 --> 00:18:59.525
(gentle music)

00:19:04.835 --> 00:19:08.175
You know, this is more than
enough for me.

00:19:09.778 --> 00:19:12.617
(gentle music)

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:15.690
- What should I do?

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:20.432
What he just said was so sweet.

00:19:20.533 --> 00:19:23.438
- [Takami] I want you
all to myself.

00:19:25.275 --> 00:19:26.846
- I'm so much happier now than
I was

00:19:26.946 --> 00:19:30.285
when I heard Takami
me say those empty words.

00:19:34.695 --> 00:19:38.402
What's the point of keeping
his empty pack of cigarettes.

00:19:42.811 --> 00:19:45.416
If nothing had happened
between me and Takami,

00:19:45.517 --> 00:19:48.556
I'm sure I would've
fallen for Nobuo.

00:19:48.656 --> 00:19:52.196
I guess I wanted to be
Nobuo's girlfriend all along.

00:19:52.296 --> 00:19:55.537
But if Takami ever comes
over to see me again,

00:19:55.637 --> 00:19:57.139
I know I won't be able to resist

00:19:57.239 --> 00:19:59.310
and I'll end up
sleeping with him.

00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:01.414
I just can't say no.

00:20:01.515 --> 00:20:04.487
If only I could figure
out what I really want,

00:20:04.588 --> 00:20:08.095
instead I just allow
myself to get carried away

00:20:08.195 --> 00:20:09.965
and then I end up with nothing.

00:20:21.154 --> 00:20:25.462
When I woke up the next
morning, Nana had already gone.

00:20:27.166 --> 00:20:28.970
She'd left a note on the table.

00:20:36.752 --> 00:20:38.523
I guess it's not that big a
deal,

00:20:38.623 --> 00:20:42.029
I can always see her when
I go to their rehearsals

00:20:42.129 --> 00:20:44.333
and it's only for two weeks.

00:20:46.906 --> 00:20:51.749
And then she'll be back
after two weeks, right?

00:20:56.291 --> 00:20:57.627
Hey, Nana.

00:20:57.727 --> 00:21:00.499
I still think about you every
day.

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:03.773
I just wanna see you
across the table from me.

00:21:05.275 --> 00:21:08.482
My heart calls out your name,

00:21:08.583 --> 00:21:12.691
over and over, as many times as
it takes.
