00:00:05.337 --> 00:00:07.407
- [Nana K] I know I'm a dreamer
at heart,

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:09.945
but I never guessed in my
wildest dreams

00:00:10.045 --> 00:00:12.351
that we'd ever see each other
again.

00:00:12.451 --> 00:00:15.890
All I knew about her
was her name.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.398
(upbeat rock music)

00:02:01.936 --> 00:02:03.171
- Oh.

00:02:05.877 --> 00:02:08.983
It looks like someone's
already here.

00:02:09.083 --> 00:02:11.254
You don't mind if I show
the place to my client?

00:02:11.355 --> 00:02:13.793
- [Yokoi] I'm sorry, but no.

00:02:13.893 --> 00:02:17.434
This young lady's pretty much
decided to take the place.

00:02:19.805 --> 00:02:21.509
- Nana?

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:22.911
It is you, isn't it?

00:02:23.011 --> 00:02:24.414
What a coincidence.

00:02:24.515 --> 00:02:26.284
- Who are you?

00:02:26.385 --> 00:02:28.823
- [Nana K] Am I that
forgettable?

00:02:28.923 --> 00:02:29.825
- Sorry. Sorry.

00:02:29.925 --> 00:02:31.127
I know who you are now.

00:02:31.227 --> 00:02:32.129
You all right, Nana?

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:33.866
- So you do remember!

00:02:33.966 --> 00:02:35.837
- I didn't recognize you
at first.

00:02:35.937 --> 00:02:36.805
Those clothes and that hair

00:02:36.906 --> 00:02:38.241
make you look completely
different.

00:02:38.342 --> 00:02:39.511
Total change of style.

00:02:39.611 --> 00:02:41.715
- So I take it you two
are friends?

00:02:41.815 --> 00:02:43.118
- Yes, we're good friend.
- I wouldn't say

00:02:43.218 --> 00:02:45.490
we're friends exactly.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.928
- Anyway, I suppose we
should get down to business,

00:02:48.028 --> 00:02:49.063
Miss Osaki.

00:02:49.163 --> 00:02:51.067
Have you decided, will you take
the place?

00:02:51.167 --> 00:02:52.904
- [Nana O] I'm still
thinking about it.

00:02:53.004 --> 00:02:54.240
- Well, if you haven't decided,

00:02:54.341 --> 00:02:56.912
perhaps you'd allow me to
give this young lady a tour

00:02:57.012 --> 00:02:58.248
of the apartment?

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:58.983
- Cool!

00:02:59.083 --> 00:03:00.486
The kitchen is so cute.

00:03:00.587 --> 00:03:01.989
The rooms are so big.

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:04.494
An old fashioned clawfoot tub?

00:03:04.595 --> 00:03:07.701
(Nana K laughing)

00:03:09.136 --> 00:03:10.205
I'll take it!

00:03:10.305 --> 00:03:11.675
- [Nana And Yokoi] Hold on a
minute.

00:03:11.775 --> 00:03:12.811
- I found this place first.

00:03:12.911 --> 00:03:15.215
You can't just barge in
here and take it from me.

00:03:15.315 --> 00:03:16.785
- I didn't mean to, I'm sorry.

00:03:16.886 --> 00:03:17.219
- You should be.

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:18.823
What about earth were you
thinking?

00:03:18.923 --> 00:03:22.162
- Didn't look as though you
had made up your mind yet.

00:03:22.263 --> 00:03:23.131
- Well, now I have.

00:03:23.231 --> 00:03:24.000
I'm taking it.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.336
Yokoi.

00:03:26.237 --> 00:03:27.172
- Wait, don't do it.

00:03:27.273 --> 00:03:28.108
- I'm not waiting.

00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:28.843
My mind's made up.

00:03:28.943 --> 00:03:31.749
I'm fed up with sleeping
in crappy rundown hotels.

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:32.417
I don't care where I live,

00:03:32.517 --> 00:03:34.287
as long as I get a
place of my own now.

00:03:34.388 --> 00:03:35.657
- If you don't care
where you live

00:03:35.757 --> 00:03:36.324
then find somewhere else,

00:03:36.425 --> 00:03:38.194
'cause this is where I want to
live.

00:03:38.295 --> 00:03:41.368
- What's wrong with you staying
at your boyfriend's?

00:03:42.303 --> 00:03:43.406
He dumped you didn't he?

00:03:43.506 --> 00:03:43.773
- No!

00:03:43.873 --> 00:03:46.812
But if things carry on the
way they have been, he might.

00:03:46.912 --> 00:03:47.547
- What do you mean?

00:03:47.647 --> 00:03:49.384
I thought you were all
lovey dovey for him.

00:03:49.484 --> 00:03:51.355
- I thought so too, but last
night he--

00:03:51.455 --> 00:03:52.657
- Excuse me,
ladies.

00:03:52.757 --> 00:03:54.962
I'm not sure now is the time
to be discussing nonsense.

00:03:55.062 --> 00:03:55.830
- [Nana K And Nana O] Nonsense?

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.936
- Here I am suffering such
pain and he calls it nonsense?

00:03:59.036 --> 00:04:00.305
- Yokoi!
- Yes?

00:04:00.406 --> 00:04:02.911
- For someone who supposedly
works in the service industry,

00:04:03.011 --> 00:04:04.180
you sure don't have much tact.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.416
- I'm sorry, I apologize.

00:04:05.516 --> 00:04:07.988
- Your job isn't just about
earning a paycheck you know.

00:04:08.088 --> 00:04:09.323
Be a little more sensitive.

00:04:09.424 --> 00:04:12.162
- [Ondo] Now now, calm down
ladies.

00:04:12.263 --> 00:04:13.332
- Sensitive?

00:04:13.432 --> 00:04:16.438
- If I may, I have a suggestion
I'd like to run by you.

00:04:16.538 --> 00:04:19.243
- Who the hell is this old
guy anyway, your grandpa?

00:04:19.344 --> 00:04:21.615
- This is Mr. Ondo from
the real estate agency

00:04:21.715 --> 00:04:22.283
by the train station.

00:04:22.384 --> 00:04:25.022
He's been in the biz for 52
years, so he's like a veteran.

00:04:25.122 --> 00:04:27.961
- It's obvious the two of
you already know each other.

00:04:28.061 --> 00:04:31.100
Perhaps you should consider
renting the apartment together.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.504
Why don't you become roommates?

00:04:32.604 --> 00:04:35.142
The place is designed with
the dining room in the middle

00:04:35.242 --> 00:04:37.046
and two bedrooms at opposite
ends,

00:04:37.146 --> 00:04:39.050
which means you can have your
own privacy.

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.956
Plus you'll have each other's
company when you want it.

00:04:42.056 --> 00:04:46.030
Sharing an apartment can be
a very rewarding experience.

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.205
Also by sharing, you'll each
only half to pay half the rent.

00:04:50.305 --> 00:04:51.875
- [Both] Half the rent?

00:04:51.976 --> 00:04:52.811
- Half of 70,000?

00:04:52.911 --> 00:04:54.381
- 35,000 yen.

00:04:54.481 --> 00:04:56.317
- [Both] That's so cheap.

00:04:56.418 --> 00:04:57.520
- [Nana K] Let's go for it,
Nana.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.056
- I suppose this means you
and I are gonna have to

00:04:59.156 --> 00:05:01.795
split our brokers fee
in half as well.

00:05:01.895 --> 00:05:02.897
- Yeah, sounds okay.

00:05:02.998 --> 00:05:04.434
But how do I know I can
live with you?

00:05:04.534 --> 00:05:06.338
Can you respect someone else's
privacy?

00:05:06.438 --> 00:05:07.974
- [Nana K] Of course I can.

00:05:08.074 --> 00:05:09.511
- If privacy is an issue,

00:05:09.611 --> 00:05:12.282
you can always put locks
on the bedroom doors.

00:05:12.384 --> 00:05:14.053
It's a very cheap solution.

00:05:14.153 --> 00:05:16.190
I can even arrange the
installation.

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.094
- Oh, thank you, Mr. Ondo, thank
you!

00:05:18.194 --> 00:05:19.731
You're such a nice person.

00:05:19.831 --> 00:05:20.533
Isn't he a nice--

00:05:20.633 --> 00:05:22.202
- Are you sure you wanna
go ahead with this?

00:05:22.302 --> 00:05:24.508
Yes, it'll be cheaper,
but think it through.

00:05:24.608 --> 00:05:26.378
Sharing an apartment
with a stranger

00:05:26.478 --> 00:05:28.649
can cause all kinds of problems.

00:05:30.887 --> 00:05:32.222
- I disagree.

00:05:33.359 --> 00:05:35.930
Yokoi, you're a sad lonely man.

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.034
Mr. Ondo.

00:05:38.134 --> 00:05:40.406
How soon can those
locks be put in?

00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:42.577
- If I arrange it right away,

00:05:42.677 --> 00:05:45.015
I can have someone come
by tomorrow morning.

00:05:45.115 --> 00:05:45.850
- Thank you.

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:46.452
Please do.

00:05:46.552 --> 00:05:49.591
I'll start moving my stuff
in tomorrow afternoon.

00:05:51.395 --> 00:05:52.630
What about you?

00:05:55.268 --> 00:05:56.939
- Yeah, me too.

00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:00.513
(light upbeat music)

00:06:04.554 --> 00:06:08.161
- Starting tomorrow, you and
I will be roommates, Nana.

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:24.928
- Just what the hell
are you thinking anyway?

00:06:25.028 --> 00:06:25.530
- Why not?

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.268
Sharing an apartment is what
foreigners do all the time.

00:06:28.369 --> 00:06:29.170
I bet it's lots of fun.

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:31.207
- How could you be
so naive, Nana?

00:06:31.307 --> 00:06:32.944
You can't just move into
an apartment

00:06:33.044 --> 00:06:35.015
with some random stranger!

00:06:35.115 --> 00:06:36.150
- But she isn't a stranger.

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:37.854
I already told you,
we met on the train.

00:06:37.954 --> 00:06:39.458
I don't think it was just a
coincidence

00:06:39.558 --> 00:06:42.229
that we were sitting
next to each other.

00:06:43.432 --> 00:06:45.470
Maybe it's got something
to do with the demon Lord.

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:46.538
- Shut up about that demon Lord.

00:06:46.638 --> 00:06:49.544
- I don't understand why
you're so mad at me, Jun.

00:06:49.644 --> 00:06:52.884
Are you jealous 'cause I'll be
living with some other girl?

00:06:52.984 --> 00:06:55.723
You know, Jun, I'd love to
move in with you if I could,

00:06:55.823 --> 00:06:59.464
but you've already got
Kyosuke, so I can't.

00:06:59.564 --> 00:07:01.735
- What if she tries to
take advantage of you?

00:07:01.835 --> 00:07:03.339
Thought of that?

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:04.775
- Take advantage?

00:07:04.875 --> 00:07:06.845
- Doesn't surprise me you'd
attract that type of woman

00:07:06.945 --> 00:07:08.849
considering the way you
act all the time.

00:07:08.949 --> 00:07:11.254
- Just what are you trying
to say Jun?

00:07:11.355 --> 00:07:11.989
- You never know,

00:07:12.089 --> 00:07:14.795
she might be a crazy
serial killer or something.

00:07:14.895 --> 00:07:16.130
- Don't be ridiculous.

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:17.467
- How can you be sure?

00:07:17.567 --> 00:07:21.307
You're moving in with
a total stranger.

00:07:21.408 --> 00:07:23.446
You could find yourself
chopped up and buried in cement

00:07:23.546 --> 00:07:26.284
and then sunk in the bottom
of Tokyo Bay.

00:07:26.385 --> 00:07:28.288
- You're overreacting!

00:07:28.389 --> 00:07:29.357
- Whatever, I give up.

00:07:29.458 --> 00:07:30.927
What do I care if something
happens?

00:07:31.027 --> 00:07:34.534
Just don't come crying
to me when it does.

00:07:34.634 --> 00:07:37.974
You know, Shoji is gonna freak
out when he hears about this.

00:07:38.074 --> 00:07:39.778
Have you even told him yet?

00:07:39.878 --> 00:07:40.145
- No.

00:07:40.245 --> 00:07:42.750
I was gonna wait till later
on when he got home from work.

00:07:42.851 --> 00:07:45.288
He probably wouldn't
want someone bugging him

00:07:45.389 --> 00:07:46.692
while he is busy working.

00:07:46.792 --> 00:07:49.397
- And it's okay to bug
me while I'm working.

00:07:49.498 --> 00:07:52.337
- Hey Jun, this is the cutest
dress ever.

00:07:52.437 --> 00:07:53.572
Maybe I'll get it. (yells)

00:07:53.672 --> 00:07:55.510
- I'm not selling you anything!

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:58.983
- Maybe there's some cool
job listings in here.

00:07:59.083 --> 00:08:00.218
Man, Jun is lucky.

00:08:00.318 --> 00:08:02.590
She gets to work in
such a cool store.

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:06.565
She's got a great body and
she's got Kyosuke, too.

00:08:09.437 --> 00:08:10.573
No lights on.

00:08:10.673 --> 00:08:12.777
I guess, Shoji's not home yet.

00:08:15.148 --> 00:08:17.420
He should have been back by now.

00:08:26.371 --> 00:08:31.748
(phone ringing)
(clock ticking)

00:08:32.884 --> 00:08:33.452
Hello?

00:08:33.552 --> 00:08:34.320
- [Automated Voice] Your
call is being forwarded

00:08:34.421 --> 00:08:35.957
to an automatic voicemail
system.

00:08:36.057 --> 00:08:37.861
At the tone, please leave a
message.

00:08:37.961 --> 00:08:40.766
- [Nana K] Why isn't
he picking up?

00:08:40.867 --> 00:08:43.906
Why didn't he call to
say he was gonna be late?

00:08:46.645 --> 00:08:48.616
What if he's seeing
someone else?

00:08:48.716 --> 00:08:50.453
No, he wouldn't do that to me.

00:08:50.553 --> 00:08:52.357
But, we have been apart
from each other

00:08:52.457 --> 00:08:53.626
for like a whole year.

00:08:53.726 --> 00:08:55.530
It makes sense that his
eyes might have wandered

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:56.832
in another direction.

00:08:56.932 --> 00:09:00.005
But we texted every day, and
Shoji was studying like crazy

00:09:00.105 --> 00:09:00.640
for his exams.

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:03.746
I don't see how he could
have been cheating on me.

00:09:04.981 --> 00:09:06.785
But Shoji is a guy, so.

00:09:09.791 --> 00:09:11.093
- A guy can sleep with a girl

00:09:11.193 --> 00:09:12.229
without having feelings for her.

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:13.799
That's how guys are.

00:09:15.937 --> 00:09:17.774
- [Nana K] Yeah, I remember
him saying something lame

00:09:17.874 --> 00:09:20.580
like that before we
started seeing each other.

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:23.318
What if he wasn't talking
about guys in general?

00:09:23.419 --> 00:09:25.723
What if he was talking about
himself?

00:09:31.835 --> 00:09:34.541
- Shoji, who do you like better?

00:09:34.641 --> 00:09:37.580
Me or that country girl of
yours?

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:40.620
- No contest, Sachiko, it's you.

00:09:41.922 --> 00:09:43.926
- Oh my God, I'm going nuts
here!

00:09:44.026 --> 00:09:45.830
Who the hell is Sachiko?

00:09:47.232 --> 00:09:50.272
(Nana pants)

00:09:50.373 --> 00:09:51.842
Time for bed.

00:09:53.111 --> 00:09:54.781
(clock ticking)

00:09:54.881 --> 00:09:59.824
Sachiko, Sachiko, Sachiko.

00:09:59.924 --> 00:10:02.630
That name means happy child.

00:10:05.503 --> 00:10:09.043
It's no use, I can't sleep.

00:10:09.143 --> 00:10:13.217
Waiting for your husband to
come home at night really sucks.

00:10:13.318 --> 00:10:16.525
Well, he's not my husband.

00:10:16.625 --> 00:10:19.597
I wonder if this is what
Takashi's wife was feeling

00:10:19.698 --> 00:10:22.904
when I was out with him.

00:10:23.839 --> 00:10:26.310
I guess this is payback time.

00:10:26.411 --> 00:10:27.880
The curse of the demon Lord.

00:10:27.981 --> 00:10:31.153
- Nana, what are you
doing out there?

00:10:31.253 --> 00:10:32.924
You're gonna catch a cold!

00:10:33.792 --> 00:10:35.028
- Shoji?

00:10:37.467 --> 00:10:38.435
Welcome home!

00:10:38.535 --> 00:10:40.640
- [Shoji] Hey, watch out!

00:10:44.146 --> 00:10:44.414
What?

00:10:44.514 --> 00:10:48.087
But I sent you a text message
saying I was gonna be late.

00:10:48.187 --> 00:10:49.023
- Oh yeah, right.

00:10:49.123 --> 00:10:49.591
I don't see one.

00:10:49.691 --> 00:10:50.993
I can't believe you
think I'd fall

00:10:51.093 --> 00:10:52.397
for such an obvious lie.

00:10:52.497 --> 00:10:53.732
You were with Sachiko.

00:10:53.832 --> 00:10:54.901
- I swore I sent it.

00:10:55.001 --> 00:10:57.840
Look it's right here
in my outbox.

00:10:59.911 --> 00:11:02.617
I sent it to Junko by mistake.

00:11:07.159 --> 00:11:08.395
(phone beeping)

00:11:08.495 --> 00:11:10.031
- What an idiot!

00:11:10.131 --> 00:11:12.302
- Huh?

00:11:12.403 --> 00:11:15.041
- I don't understand why
Shoji doesn't just ask Nana

00:11:15.141 --> 00:11:17.380
if she wants to move
in with him.

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.016
- It seems obvious to me.

00:11:19.116 --> 00:11:21.287
He doesn't want her relying
on him all the time.

00:11:21.388 --> 00:11:23.324
He wants her to be more
independent.

00:11:23.425 --> 00:11:24.894
- Believe me, I'm all for that.

00:11:24.994 --> 00:11:28.902
But expecting that from
Nana is a waste of time.

00:11:29.002 --> 00:11:29.871
- I hear you.

00:11:29.971 --> 00:11:32.109
Shoji's been so busy studying
this year.

00:11:32.209 --> 00:11:35.449
No wonder he's been worried
about the relationship.

00:11:35.549 --> 00:11:36.551
- Why worried?

00:11:36.651 --> 00:11:38.522
He's not thinking of breaking up
with her?

00:11:38.622 --> 00:11:39.491
- No, no.

00:11:39.591 --> 00:11:40.659
The opposite.

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.764
He actually wants to marry her.

00:11:43.632 --> 00:11:44.033
- Marry her?

00:11:44.133 --> 00:11:46.371
That's crazy, he's
only 20 years old.

00:11:46.471 --> 00:11:46.905
- He knows that.

00:11:47.005 --> 00:11:50.346
I don't think he wants
to do it right away.

00:11:50.446 --> 00:11:52.215
He's going to college,
which means he won't be able

00:11:52.315 --> 00:11:56.123
to support Nana financially
for a few more years.

00:11:56.223 --> 00:11:58.529
So now he's worrying about
whether he should quit

00:11:58.629 --> 00:12:00.332
going to school altogether and
just go out

00:12:00.433 --> 00:12:01.601
and get himself a good job.

00:12:01.701 --> 00:12:02.737
- What's there to worry about?

00:12:02.837 --> 00:12:03.906
He should make her wait.

00:12:04.006 --> 00:12:05.108
Throwing your life's plans away

00:12:05.208 --> 00:12:07.647
for the sake of a woman
is a stupid thing to do.

00:12:07.747 --> 00:12:10.586
- Well, yeah, totally.

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:14.594
But, you know Nana.

00:12:14.694 --> 00:12:16.331
You really think she
can wait all those years

00:12:16.431 --> 00:12:18.669
till Shoji's ready
to support her?

00:12:19.637 --> 00:12:20.038
- I don't know.

00:12:20.138 --> 00:12:22.242
Suppose she meet some
older, smarter, richer guy

00:12:22.343 --> 00:12:23.144
who promises to look after her.

00:12:23.244 --> 00:12:26.050
She'll probably run off with
him without a second thought.

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:27.285
- You think?

00:12:27.386 --> 00:12:27.820
- Sure, why not?

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:29.323
If a guy like that ever came
along,

00:12:29.424 --> 00:12:30.459
I'd consider going with him.

00:12:30.559 --> 00:12:32.697
- Yeah, I bet you
probably would.

00:12:32.797 --> 00:12:35.536
- Oh, why are you so laid
back about everything?

00:12:35.636 --> 00:12:36.036
- What?

00:12:36.137 --> 00:12:39.344
How did this suddenly turn
into a conversation about me?

00:12:39.444 --> 00:12:39.878
- Nana?

00:12:39.978 --> 00:12:42.950
What in hell's name did
you think you were doing?

00:12:44.354 --> 00:12:46.257
Sometimes, you can be so naive.

00:12:46.358 --> 00:12:46.992
You don't even know this girl.

00:12:47.092 --> 00:12:49.163
You can't move in with
a total stranger.

00:12:49.263 --> 00:12:49.798
It's too much of a risk.

00:12:49.898 --> 00:12:52.537
- Shoji, I've already
heard it from Jun.

00:12:52.637 --> 00:12:53.572
I don't need to hear it from you
too.

00:12:53.672 --> 00:12:55.208
- Okay, okay.

00:12:55.308 --> 00:12:56.378
Let's think about this.

00:12:56.478 --> 00:12:57.880
- I'm sorry.

00:12:59.484 --> 00:13:01.588
- All right, I've got it.

00:13:01.688 --> 00:13:04.861
Let's live together, okay?

00:13:04.961 --> 00:13:07.232
If you don't wanna
live on your own,

00:13:07.333 --> 00:13:09.236
then you should stay here.

00:13:09.337 --> 00:13:10.706
- Yes, but.

00:13:10.806 --> 00:13:13.244
- Are you worried there
won't be enough room here

00:13:13.345 --> 00:13:14.179
for both of us?

00:13:14.279 --> 00:13:15.983
We could look for something
bigger.

00:13:16.083 --> 00:13:18.355
- It has nothing to do with
that.

00:13:18.455 --> 00:13:19.189
If we live together,

00:13:19.289 --> 00:13:21.628
I'm scared you're gonna start
hating me.

00:13:21.728 --> 00:13:25.669
I can be a selfish,
spoiled brat sometimes.

00:13:25.769 --> 00:13:27.573
- Don't you think I know
that already?

00:13:27.673 --> 00:13:29.744
I'm definitely used to
that by now.

00:13:29.844 --> 00:13:31.280
- That's mean!

00:13:31.381 --> 00:13:32.350
- I'm just kidding.

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:35.321
So you want to do it, huh?

00:13:35.422 --> 00:13:39.296
- Shoji, thank you for that.

00:13:39.397 --> 00:13:41.401
I'm glad to hear you say it.

00:13:41.501 --> 00:13:43.639
But there's no way!

00:13:43.739 --> 00:13:44.574
Now I've heard those words,

00:13:44.674 --> 00:13:46.811
I know how you really
feel about me.

00:13:46.912 --> 00:13:48.982
I know that you're
picking me over Sachiko.

00:13:49.082 --> 00:13:51.421
- Who the hell's Sachiko?

00:13:51.521 --> 00:13:52.924
- The thing is, you're too nice.

00:13:53.024 --> 00:13:53.859
And if we live together,

00:13:53.959 --> 00:13:57.733
you'd spoil me and I'd
rely on you for everything.

00:13:57.834 --> 00:14:00.873
I don't ever wanna become
a burden to you, Shoji.

00:14:02.343 --> 00:14:04.948
- But listen, Nana, if you're
gonna be a burden to anyone,

00:14:05.048 --> 00:14:07.653
I'd rather you be a burden to
me than to a total stranger.

00:14:07.753 --> 00:14:09.457
- I don't wanna be
a burden to anyone.

00:14:09.557 --> 00:14:12.864
I'm 20 years old and I need to
know I can look after myself.

00:14:12.964 --> 00:14:15.636
I wanna be a strong role
model for girls to look up to.

00:14:15.736 --> 00:14:18.642
Please, you have to understand.

00:14:18.742 --> 00:14:19.677
- You have to understand

00:14:19.777 --> 00:14:22.182
that that's what
I want for you too.

00:14:22.282 --> 00:14:25.556
Well, anyway, if you wanna
go and live on your own,

00:14:25.656 --> 00:14:27.292
I can't stop you.

00:14:28.027 --> 00:14:30.265
Go be independent.

00:14:30.366 --> 00:14:32.970
I'd just prefer it if you
weren't living

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:34.474
with some complete stranger.

00:14:34.574 --> 00:14:35.576
- But why is that?

00:14:35.676 --> 00:14:38.882
Why does everyone have
something against Nana?

00:14:38.982 --> 00:14:40.886
- It's not that we have
anything against her.

00:14:40.986 --> 00:14:44.961
It's just you aren't exactly
a good judge of people.

00:14:45.863 --> 00:14:47.198
- But I know lots about her.

00:14:47.299 --> 00:14:47.833
She's beautiful.

00:14:47.934 --> 00:14:51.240
And she's got a sexy
voice and she's so cool.

00:14:53.311 --> 00:14:56.083
She could be a model, a
movie star, a rock star.

00:14:56.183 --> 00:14:57.218
- Would you listen to yourself?

00:14:57.319 --> 00:14:59.891
How can you know anything
about what she's really like

00:14:59.991 --> 00:15:01.126
from how she looks?

00:15:01.226 --> 00:15:04.367
- If you met her, you'd
like her too, Shoji.

00:15:04.467 --> 00:15:06.838
But what'll happen if you
end up liking that Nana

00:15:06.938 --> 00:15:08.342
more than you like me?

00:15:08.442 --> 00:15:10.245
I think I'd die.

00:15:13.317 --> 00:15:14.319
- Okay, fine.

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:15.054
Introduce us.

00:15:15.154 --> 00:15:16.891
I'll go with you to
the apartment tomorrow.

00:15:16.992 --> 00:15:18.395
- You won't fall
in love with her?

00:15:18.495 --> 00:15:19.296
- I promise.

00:15:19.397 --> 00:15:22.803
I've already got my hands
full with you and Sachiko.

00:15:22.903 --> 00:15:23.805
- All right.

00:15:23.905 --> 00:15:25.308
That's okay then.

00:15:25.409 --> 00:15:26.878
Sachiko is a wild one.

00:15:26.978 --> 00:15:28.982
You couldn't handle her
even if you wanted to.

00:15:29.082 --> 00:15:31.921
- Who is this Sachiko anyway?

00:15:35.596 --> 00:15:36.598
(orchestral music)

00:15:36.698 --> 00:15:37.800
- Wow.

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:39.136
When you said the place
was in an old building,

00:15:39.236 --> 00:15:42.075
I never thought it'd
be as nice as this.

00:15:44.146 --> 00:15:46.985
- The rent's so cheap,
there's gotta be a catch.

00:15:47.085 --> 00:15:48.922
Maybe the place is haunted.

00:15:49.022 --> 00:15:50.459
- You mean there might be
ghosts?

00:15:50.559 --> 00:15:52.430
- He's just trying to spook you.

00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:53.899
Why'd you guys come here anyway?

00:15:53.999 --> 00:15:56.003
- Well, why shouldn't
we come here?

00:15:56.103 --> 00:15:57.038
I'd like to meet this freak

00:15:57.138 --> 00:15:58.875
who actually wants
to live with Nana.

00:15:58.976 --> 00:16:00.011
She must be out of her mind.

00:16:00.111 --> 00:16:03.284
- We can say we're checking
the place out for her parents.

00:16:03.385 --> 00:16:04.152
- Okay.

00:16:04.252 --> 00:16:06.591
So which one's your apartment?

00:16:06.691 --> 00:16:08.762
- It's number 707.

00:16:08.862 --> 00:16:09.797
- 707?

00:16:09.897 --> 00:16:10.766
- Bad luck!

00:16:10.866 --> 00:16:12.603
- When's you guys start
getting superstitious

00:16:12.703 --> 00:16:14.374
about the demon Lord?

00:16:14.474 --> 00:16:17.513
(bell dinging)

00:16:17.613 --> 00:16:18.715
- [Nana] Hmm, no answer.

00:16:18.815 --> 00:16:20.719
Maybe Nana's not home yet.

00:16:20.819 --> 00:16:22.490
- Don't you have a key?

00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:23.692
- [Nana] Oh no, not yet.

00:16:23.792 --> 00:16:24.326
- Why not?

00:16:24.427 --> 00:16:26.564
You signed the lease and
paid the rent, didn't you?

00:16:26.665 --> 00:16:27.132
- Yeah.

00:16:27.232 --> 00:16:28.869
But I had to get someone
to be the guarantor,

00:16:28.969 --> 00:16:30.271
so I asked my dad.

00:16:30.372 --> 00:16:32.543
I'm hoping all the
paperwork is gonna arrive

00:16:32.643 --> 00:16:33.812
in the mail by tomorrow.

00:16:33.912 --> 00:16:34.547
- Wait a minute.

00:16:34.647 --> 00:16:36.918
So you're not technically
renting the place yet?

00:16:37.018 --> 00:16:39.557
- Well, I already paid
the agent their fees.

00:16:39.657 --> 00:16:40.058
- You've been conned.

00:16:40.158 --> 00:16:42.496
I knew it was too
good to be true!

00:16:46.971 --> 00:16:50.111
(door squeaking)

00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:55.856
(upbeat rock music)

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:02.001
- And who might you be?

00:17:02.102 --> 00:17:04.774
- I'm sorry, we must
have the wrong apartment.

00:17:04.874 --> 00:17:05.376
- I don't believe this.

00:17:05.476 --> 00:17:06.444
- [Kyosuke] Are we on
the right floor?

00:17:06.544 --> 00:17:08.080
- [Jun] I knew something
like would happen.

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:10.352
- Yasu what's wrong with this
place?

00:17:10.452 --> 00:17:12.556
There's no hot water.

00:17:12.656 --> 00:17:14.727
- Put some clothes on.
- It was the right place.

00:17:14.827 --> 00:17:15.294
- What?

00:17:15.396 --> 00:17:17.032
- Did you call to make
an appointment

00:17:17.132 --> 00:17:19.069
to get the gas turned on?

00:17:19.169 --> 00:17:21.106
- [Nana O] Turned on?

00:17:21.206 --> 00:17:22.410
- Nana!

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:23.345
- Oh, Hey Nana.

00:17:23.445 --> 00:17:24.881
Where have you been?

00:17:24.981 --> 00:17:26.116
What took you so long?

00:17:26.216 --> 00:17:28.054
- [Yasu] Hey, Nana, put some
clothes on.

00:17:28.154 --> 00:17:30.291
- So, is that your boyfriend?

00:17:30.392 --> 00:17:31.628
- [Nana K] And these are my
friends, too.

00:17:31.728 --> 00:17:32.530
- She's totally my type.

00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:33.665
- Oh, really, lucky you.

00:17:33.765 --> 00:17:35.201
- I'm freezing.

00:17:35.301 --> 00:17:37.238
I'm gonna catch a cold if I stay
out here.

00:17:37.339 --> 00:17:40.244
What if I lose my precious
singing voice?

00:17:40.846 --> 00:17:41.213
- Well, come in.

00:17:41.313 --> 00:17:43.385
I didn't know you were her
roommate.

00:17:43.485 --> 00:17:44.019
- [Nana] Yes. Sorry.

00:17:44.119 --> 00:17:45.154
I mean, thank you.

00:17:45.254 --> 00:17:45.756
Sorry!

00:17:45.856 --> 00:17:47.092
- Why are you apologizing?

00:17:47.192 --> 00:17:47.593
This is your apartment.

00:17:47.693 --> 00:17:50.098
You're allowed to go
in without asking.

00:17:50.198 --> 00:17:53.705
Hello, I'm Junko Saotome,
I'm a friend of Nana Komatsu.

00:17:53.805 --> 00:17:55.943
It's very nice to meet
you and you are?

00:17:56.043 --> 00:17:58.982
- She's not shy, I'll
give her that.

00:17:59.082 --> 00:18:02.423
- Ah, excuse me for not
introducing myself earlier.

00:18:02.523 --> 00:18:06.331
I'm Yasushi Takagi, a friend
and associate of Nana Osaki.

00:18:06.431 --> 00:18:07.433
Here's my card.

00:18:09.035 --> 00:18:10.304
- Thank you.

00:18:11.641 --> 00:18:12.275
- You work for a law firm?

00:18:12.376 --> 00:18:14.079
- A lawyer?
- Really?

00:18:14.179 --> 00:18:15.314
- Well, I'm still clerking now,

00:18:15.415 --> 00:18:17.787
but if you ever need a lawyer
for anything, give me a call.

00:18:17.887 --> 00:18:19.891
I'd be happy to help.

00:18:19.991 --> 00:18:21.528
- Then do something about this,
Yasu!

00:18:21.628 --> 00:18:23.698
I can't deal with this no hot
water thing.

00:18:23.799 --> 00:18:26.704
- I already told you, you
need to call the gas company

00:18:26.805 --> 00:18:27.807
and get someone to come and--

00:18:27.907 --> 00:18:28.875
- Then you call them.

00:18:28.975 --> 00:18:30.512
- [Yasu] All right, all right.

00:18:30.612 --> 00:18:31.414
What's the number?

00:18:31.514 --> 00:18:34.654
- [Nana O] Okay, any of
you guys want some tea?

00:18:34.754 --> 00:18:35.522
- Let me help you.

00:18:35.622 --> 00:18:37.893
- You got any cups or
a kettle or anything?

00:18:37.993 --> 00:18:38.695
- Mm-mm.

00:18:38.795 --> 00:18:40.332
- You're useless.

00:18:40.432 --> 00:18:40.933
- Oh I'm sorry.

00:18:41.033 --> 00:18:41.434
- It doesn't matter.

00:18:41.534 --> 00:18:42.670
You won't be able
to use the stove

00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:44.005
until the gas is turned on.

00:18:44.105 --> 00:18:45.074
- [Nana O] Oh, right.

00:18:45.174 --> 00:18:46.978
- I never knew you
had to do that.

00:18:47.078 --> 00:18:48.047
- So when are they coming?

00:18:48.147 --> 00:18:49.517
- Don't know, the line was busy.

00:18:49.617 --> 00:18:50.719
You're gonna need
to fill this out

00:18:50.819 --> 00:18:54.059
and send it to the power
company for your electricity.

00:18:54.159 --> 00:18:54.927
And let me see.

00:18:55.027 --> 00:18:56.196
The water's
included in the rent,

00:18:56.296 --> 00:18:58.200
so you don't have
to worry about that.

00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:00.706
Oh, but don't forget to
register your new address

00:19:00.806 --> 00:19:02.008
with city hall.

00:19:02.108 --> 00:19:04.246
- Well, I guess we better get
going, Nana.

00:19:04.347 --> 00:19:06.083
Looks like we can trust
this guy to take care

00:19:06.183 --> 00:19:07.386
of everything for you.

00:19:07.486 --> 00:19:08.588
- We can?

00:19:08.688 --> 00:19:10.258
- Y'all take it easy now, okay?

00:19:10.359 --> 00:19:12.630
- Huh, is everyone leaving
already?

00:19:14.567 --> 00:19:16.203
This girl doesn't have
a clue about manners

00:19:16.303 --> 00:19:17.940
but I hope you'll
take pity on her.

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:21.113
- And the same goes
for this one.

00:19:21.213 --> 00:19:23.652
- Shoji, you sticking
around to coming with us?

00:19:23.752 --> 00:19:24.554
You gotta work tonight, right?

00:19:24.654 --> 00:19:26.925
- Yeah. I don't know what
I should do.

00:19:27.025 --> 00:19:30.164
- Don't feel like you have to
stay here to keep me company.

00:19:30.264 --> 00:19:32.536
Nana's here with me,
so I'll be okay.

00:19:32.636 --> 00:19:32.837
- Yeah, Shoji.

00:19:32.937 --> 00:19:35.208
She'll be fine here with me,
so off you go to your job

00:19:35.308 --> 00:19:38.247
and earn some money
like a real man.

00:19:38.348 --> 00:19:41.253
- Well, I hope this means
everything's gonna be all right.

00:19:41.354 --> 00:19:43.358
That lawyer guy Yasushi
knows what he's doing

00:19:43.458 --> 00:19:46.230
getting them settled with
all the apartment stuff.

00:19:46.331 --> 00:19:47.800
And I gotta admit, the two Nanas

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:50.137
seem to be getting along
fabulously.

00:19:50.238 --> 00:19:51.507
Two peas in a pod.

00:19:51.608 --> 00:19:54.079
- The other Nana seems
wackier than our Nana.

00:19:54.179 --> 00:19:55.314
If that's even possible.

00:19:55.415 --> 00:19:57.486
- [Shoji] Stop saying Nana and
Nana.

00:19:57.586 --> 00:20:00.157
I think my worries have
just doubled.

00:20:00.258 --> 00:20:03.832
Since Nana means seven,
two Nanas is 14

00:20:03.932 --> 00:20:05.301
and square root would be 49.

00:20:05.402 --> 00:20:08.107
- [Nana K] And that's how
our lives together began.

00:20:08.207 --> 00:20:12.383
There were no problems,
at least not for me.

00:20:14.654 --> 00:20:16.323
- Hey Nana, the earliest
appointment I could get

00:20:16.424 --> 00:20:17.993
with a gas company is tomorrow.

00:20:18.093 --> 00:20:18.528
- What?

00:20:18.628 --> 00:20:21.334
You mean I gotta survive
with no heat until tomorrow?

00:20:21.434 --> 00:20:23.070
- Don't see a heater
around, so I guess so.

00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:24.205
- No way!

00:20:24.306 --> 00:20:26.744
- [Yasu] If you get
cold, put on a sweater.

00:20:26.844 --> 00:20:27.446
- I don't have one.

00:20:27.546 --> 00:20:29.717
I only brought my leather jacket
with me.

00:20:29.817 --> 00:20:30.852
I'm gonna freeze to death.

00:20:30.953 --> 00:20:33.725
- You could always borrow
one of my sweaters.

00:20:33.825 --> 00:20:34.827
- Really?

00:20:34.927 --> 00:20:35.696
That's great.

00:20:35.796 --> 00:20:37.265
Thanks a lot.

00:20:37.366 --> 00:20:39.035
- [Nana K] When I first got to
Tokyo,

00:20:39.135 --> 00:20:41.106
I was freaked out
about everything.

00:20:41.206 --> 00:20:42.910
Would I get a job?

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:45.014
How would I make it on my own?

00:20:45.114 --> 00:20:46.918
How would things go with Shoji?

00:20:47.018 --> 00:20:50.291
There was so much to
worry about.

00:20:50.392 --> 00:20:52.763
- Whoa, you got a lot of clothes
in there.

00:20:52.863 --> 00:20:55.101
You a door to door
sales girl or something?

00:20:55.201 --> 00:20:55.769
- Of course.

00:20:55.869 --> 00:20:58.808
How'd you like to try this one
on, ma'am?

00:20:58.908 --> 00:21:02.716
It's weird, but the one thing
that didn't freak me out

00:21:02.816 --> 00:21:05.722
at all was moving in with Nana.

00:21:05.822 --> 00:21:07.559
I have no idea why.

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:11.801
It was just one of those
feelings that you can't
describe.

00:21:11.901 --> 00:21:14.239
Like it was meant to be.
