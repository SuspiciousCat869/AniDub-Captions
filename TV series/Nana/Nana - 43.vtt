WEBVTT

00:00:03.188 --> 00:00:04.792
- [Nana] It's not like
anything super serious

00:00:04.892 --> 00:00:07.063
or horrible happened.

00:00:08.967 --> 00:00:11.037
It was some weird live
footage on a quiet morning

00:00:11.138 --> 00:00:14.177
revealing a scandalous
singer with caked-on makeup.

00:00:14.277 --> 00:00:15.680
(birds chirping)

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.483
It definitely had
an effect though.

00:00:17.584 --> 00:00:19.387
(rock music)

00:00:19.487 --> 00:00:23.963
I figured we could use that
attention to get what we wanted.

00:01:58.753 --> 00:02:00.089
- [Girl 1] Hey, did you see it
on TV?

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:01.358
Today's Seven in the Morning?

00:02:01.458 --> 00:02:02.561
- [Girl 2] Yeah, Nana.

00:02:02.661 --> 00:02:03.428
- [Girl 3] Who's that?

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:04.464
- [Girl 1] Ren's girl.

00:02:04.565 --> 00:02:05.600
- [Girl 3] He has a girlfriend?

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.270
- [Girl 2] She totally pisses me
off.

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.340
- But she's super hot, don't you
think?

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.512
- [Boy 1] You think so?
I thought she looked evil.

00:02:11.612 --> 00:02:12.681
I think she put a curse on me.

00:02:12.781 --> 00:02:14.417
- [Woman 1] A curse?
Girls nowadays,

00:02:14.518 --> 00:02:16.021
using a man to become famous.

00:02:16.121 --> 00:02:18.559
- It's unforgivable,
manipulating Ren like that.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.429
- Oh, do you like Ren Honjo?
Me, too.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.266
Ever since he did that
canned coffee commercial.

00:02:22.366 --> 00:02:24.838
- The bass player.
Now he's really cute.

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:27.009
Who cares about Nana?
I wanna know his name.

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:27.811
- Forget the bassist.

00:02:27.911 --> 00:02:29.748
Who's the guitarist?
- I totally missed it.

00:02:29.848 --> 00:02:30.416
What's the band's name?

00:02:30.517 --> 00:02:32.721
- Hey don't you make
your own flowers bloom?

00:02:32.821 --> 00:02:35.527
- Do you even know what
it is you're saying?

00:02:35.627 --> 00:02:36.161
(phone ringing)

00:02:36.261 --> 00:02:37.296
- Good morning, Gaia Records.

00:02:37.396 --> 00:02:39.200
- [Worker 1] Sorry, the release
date hasn't been determined.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.436
- [Worker 2] There'll be
an official announcement

00:02:40.537 --> 00:02:43.375
once the details have been sent.

00:02:44.477 --> 00:02:49.020
- We have no choice,
but to go along with it.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.857
The phones have been ringing off
the hook.

00:02:50.957 --> 00:02:52.794
Everyone's suddenly
changed their minds.

00:02:52.894 --> 00:02:55.065
Now they want to push forward.

00:02:55.165 --> 00:02:57.103
- I just don't like it.
Even if they get big

00:02:57.203 --> 00:03:00.744
with this tabloid crap, it'll
just be a flash in the pan.

00:03:00.844 --> 00:03:02.914
When this magazine hits
the stands tomorrow,

00:03:03.015 --> 00:03:05.352
Nana will get bashed
up even more.

00:03:05.452 --> 00:03:08.125
Talented musicians getting
their careers destroyed

00:03:08.225 --> 00:03:10.062
by slander, and record companies

00:03:10.162 --> 00:03:12.567
who care only about one
thing, the bottom line.

00:03:12.668 --> 00:03:16.509
But you've seen this
before, haven't you, Matsuo?

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:18.846
- But all your effort up to
this point will be wasted

00:03:18.946 --> 00:03:20.215
if you quit on them now.

00:03:20.315 --> 00:03:25.259
I say, don't fight this and
just do what the label wants.

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:28.065
Upper management isn't
interested in hearing your
opinions

00:03:28.165 --> 00:03:29.133
or your complaints.

00:03:29.233 --> 00:03:31.739
That's obvious since they
never gave you a heads up

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:35.079
about this whole media
onslaught.

00:03:35.179 --> 00:03:37.216
Anyone who knows anything
about this business

00:03:37.316 --> 00:03:39.722
would easily be able
to figure out that Gaia

00:03:39.822 --> 00:03:42.627
was behind that broadcast.

00:03:42.728 --> 00:03:48.639
The media knows that, and
they're happily eating it all
up.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.175
The party's already started.

00:03:50.275 --> 00:03:53.081
There's no stopping it now.

00:03:55.987 --> 00:03:58.926
- Ugh, I've had it with
that old Tanuki face!

00:03:59.027 --> 00:04:01.297
Stuffing me in this cheap hotel.
Ugh.

00:04:01.398 --> 00:04:03.770
Get us a penthouse suite
or a deluxe room, at least.

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:04.738
- You're totally right.

00:04:04.838 --> 00:04:06.374
This is the rudest thing ever.

00:04:06.474 --> 00:04:08.445
- You think so? Because
I think it's amazing

00:04:08.546 --> 00:04:11.351
that Gaia decided to do
anything for us.

00:04:11.451 --> 00:04:14.323
But yeah, a hotel with room
service would be nice right now.

00:04:14.424 --> 00:04:15.492
I'm starving.

00:04:15.593 --> 00:04:17.263
- Do you want me to go get you
something?

00:04:17.363 --> 00:04:20.402
- Sushi!
- Got it. No problem.

00:04:21.672 --> 00:04:23.442
I'll be right back.

00:04:23.543 --> 00:04:25.345
(gasp)

00:04:25.446 --> 00:04:26.314
- Hey, Misato.

00:04:26.414 --> 00:04:29.855
- Welcome back, Yasu. How
did everything go with Gaia?

00:04:29.955 --> 00:04:31.291
- I didn't expect to see you
here.

00:04:31.391 --> 00:04:33.563
- Ah, she saw that stupid show
this morning, got worried,

00:04:33.663 --> 00:04:36.134
and rushed over here.
That's my Misato.

00:04:36.234 --> 00:04:38.973
- I'm just relieved 'cause
Nana seems totally fine.

00:04:39.073 --> 00:04:39.641
Right, Nana?

00:04:39.742 --> 00:04:42.346
- But how did you know that
we were here in this hotel?

00:04:42.446 --> 00:04:45.119
- I got a text message
from Shin.

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:46.555
- What a nice boy you are.

00:04:46.655 --> 00:04:48.726
- Well, I knew she'd wanna
come see us right away.

00:04:48.826 --> 00:04:52.066
Plus she said she's gonna
stay with us for a while.

00:04:52.166 --> 00:04:53.468
And since we can't go anywhere,

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:56.609
it'll be great to have her
around to run errands for us.

00:04:56.709 --> 00:04:57.978
- I'm in room 7-1-2.

00:04:58.078 --> 00:05:00.182
Feel free to call me whenever
you need me.

00:05:00.282 --> 00:05:01.384
- But what about school?

00:05:01.484 --> 00:05:04.925
- Oh, you don't need to worry
about that.

00:05:05.025 --> 00:05:06.394
- All right, then.

00:05:06.494 --> 00:05:10.537
We got this as a present
from Mr. Nishimoto at Gaia.

00:05:10.637 --> 00:05:12.106
Misato, you can eat mine.

00:05:12.206 --> 00:05:13.576
- What? It's food?

00:05:13.676 --> 00:05:15.680
- Oh, I couldn't take yours.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:16.281
- No, really.

00:05:16.381 --> 00:05:19.922
I just had a lunch meeting
with Mr. Kawano. I'm stuffed.

00:05:20.022 --> 00:05:22.226
So don't worry. Go
ahead and help yourself.

00:05:22.326 --> 00:05:24.665
- Thanks. I feel bad for eating
your food.

00:05:24.765 --> 00:05:25.299
- And make us some tea.

00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:27.036
- So who is this Nishimoto guy?

00:05:27.136 --> 00:05:28.973
- The head of Gaia's
production department.

00:05:29.073 --> 00:05:31.377
He came by the studio
that one time, remember?

00:05:31.478 --> 00:05:34.785
- Huh, well, a lot of guys
came by to watch us play.

00:05:34.885 --> 00:05:37.456
How can I keep track of
who's who? What was he like?

00:05:37.557 --> 00:05:39.494
- I'd say he looks
like a sly fox.

00:05:39.595 --> 00:05:40.530
- [Yasu] (laughs)

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:41.632
- A fox.

00:05:45.974 --> 00:05:48.613
Gaia's just full of shady
characters.

00:05:48.713 --> 00:05:50.182
- Nana, it's super fancy sushi.

00:05:50.282 --> 00:05:53.121
(twinkling bells)

00:05:53.221 --> 00:05:56.261
- Nishimoto's such a great guy.

00:05:56.361 --> 00:05:58.799
But wait, what does it mean
when a big wig like that

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.169
buys us expensive food?

00:06:00.269 --> 00:06:02.774
- They're finally gonna release
your CD!

00:06:02.874 --> 00:06:03.375
- Yeah.

00:06:03.475 --> 00:06:06.916
It seems they want to cash
in on our recent exposure.

00:06:07.016 --> 00:06:08.920
- That fox ain't so hard
to figure out.

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.759
- Congratulations, you guys!

00:06:11.859 --> 00:06:15.098
- Nana, no one's forcing
you to do this.

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:17.269
If you don't feel this
is how we should debut,

00:06:17.369 --> 00:06:19.006
you don't have to sign
the contract.

00:06:19.106 --> 00:06:20.175
- Oh, that's right.

00:06:20.275 --> 00:06:22.446
Sorry, I wasn't thinking.

00:06:22.547 --> 00:06:25.185
- What the hell are you saying?
Of course we're doing this.

00:06:25.285 --> 00:06:28.358
I already threw out
my stupid pride.

00:06:28.458 --> 00:06:30.062
Now that I've been put
in this position,

00:06:30.162 --> 00:06:33.201
I'm gonna use Ren as
much as I can.

00:06:33.301 --> 00:06:34.872
I promised myself
I'd do anything

00:06:34.972 --> 00:06:36.575
to climb up the
music biz ladder,

00:06:36.675 --> 00:06:38.378
and I'll climb so high
no one will ever

00:06:38.478 --> 00:06:40.148
look down on me.
- Nana, you're so cool.

00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:42.821
- (laughs) You just
realized that?

00:06:42.921 --> 00:06:44.090
- I can't use chopsticks.

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:46.427
- You're unbelievable.

00:06:48.164 --> 00:06:49.166
- Where's Nobuo?

00:06:49.267 --> 00:06:52.172
- I'm pretty sure he
locked himself in his room.

00:06:52.273 --> 00:06:56.281
- That rich kid is such
a baby sometimes.

00:06:59.755 --> 00:07:02.059
(beep)

00:07:03.996 --> 00:07:06.301
(beep)

00:07:10.008 --> 00:07:10.843
(knocking)

00:07:10.944 --> 00:07:11.645
- Huh?

00:07:11.745 --> 00:07:14.685
(twinkling bells)

00:07:14.785 --> 00:07:17.958
You can't break me
with food anymore.

00:07:18.058 --> 00:07:22.433
- Come on. Food is just
food. Eat it, all right?

00:07:26.675 --> 00:07:29.013
- I'm so pissed that our
debut on a major label

00:07:29.113 --> 00:07:30.516
is happening like this.

00:07:30.617 --> 00:07:33.221
I can't believe Nana's
going along with it.

00:07:33.321 --> 00:07:35.994
I mean, where did her pride go?

00:07:36.094 --> 00:07:41.471
- I'm pretty sure Nana gets her
pride from facing adversity.

00:07:41.572 --> 00:07:44.076
- Yeah, but I have my
pride too, you know.

00:07:44.176 --> 00:07:48.251
Gaia doesn't give a crap
about our music.

00:07:48.351 --> 00:07:51.257
Is this what the major
labels are like?

00:07:51.357 --> 00:07:54.196
- Yep, that's pretty much how
all the big companies operate.

00:07:54.297 --> 00:07:56.067
If they think it'll sell,
anything goes.

00:07:56.167 --> 00:07:57.169
- But Yasu...

00:07:57.269 --> 00:07:58.104
- And you're right.

00:07:58.204 --> 00:07:59.240
Gaia is probably involved

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:01.845
in this media feeding
frenzy somehow.

00:08:01.946 --> 00:08:03.214
- Yeah, I thought so.

00:08:03.315 --> 00:08:05.620
- At least that's the theory
that Kawano Matsuo and I

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:09.093
managed to come up with
after thinking it over.

00:08:09.193 --> 00:08:10.530
Did you know the network that
broadcasts

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:13.268
Seven in the Morning also
has two music programs

00:08:13.368 --> 00:08:15.005
on their schedule?

00:08:15.105 --> 00:08:16.742
Gaia often has music
and artists that appear

00:08:16.842 --> 00:08:20.215
on those shows, a
benefit for both sides.

00:08:20.315 --> 00:08:22.152
So who knows what kind
of deals are going on

00:08:22.252 --> 00:08:24.023
behind the scenes?

00:08:24.123 --> 00:08:26.060
Our band gets this
splashy introduction

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:27.764
as the latest thing from Gaia.

00:08:27.864 --> 00:08:28.465
In order for that to happen,

00:08:28.566 --> 00:08:31.170
the TV station had to
contact Gaia ahead of time

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:33.341
to put together some sort
of agreement.

00:08:33.441 --> 00:08:34.811
Otherwise they never
would've mentioned

00:08:34.911 --> 00:08:36.014
the record company's name.

00:08:36.114 --> 00:08:37.049
- Huh.

00:08:37.149 --> 00:08:39.755
- The show was clearly set
up to be our promotional push

00:08:39.855 --> 00:08:41.124
into the spotlight.

00:08:41.224 --> 00:08:43.094
My guess is that was
Gaia's condition

00:08:43.194 --> 00:08:46.367
for allowing the whole
thing to be broadcast.

00:08:46.467 --> 00:08:49.306
Even if the promotion fails
and we end up in the tank,

00:08:49.407 --> 00:08:52.079
Gaia would lose nothing from it.

00:08:52.179 --> 00:08:54.150
- This totally sucks.

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:55.753
Nana acts like it doesn't bother
her,

00:08:55.853 --> 00:08:58.693
but I know she must
be feeling really hurt.

00:08:58.793 --> 00:09:03.335
And I don't wanna be on
a record label like that.

00:09:03.435 --> 00:09:05.405
- Well, no matter what
label we're on,

00:09:05.506 --> 00:09:07.644
there'll always be shady
deals like that.

00:09:07.744 --> 00:09:09.213
It's just business.

00:09:09.313 --> 00:09:11.417
But, the good thing about
Gaia is that,

00:09:11.518 --> 00:09:13.656
at the very least,
they've got deep pockets

00:09:13.756 --> 00:09:15.392
that we can tap into.

00:09:15.492 --> 00:09:17.630
It's one thing to be
all about the music,

00:09:17.731 --> 00:09:21.437
but unless people actually get
to hear it, what's the point?

00:09:21.538 --> 00:09:23.609
If we're gonna be on
a major label

00:09:23.709 --> 00:09:25.546
it's best to deal with
one that gives us loads

00:09:25.646 --> 00:09:30.088
of money for production
and promotion.

00:09:30.188 --> 00:09:31.792
I think there are a lot of
things in life

00:09:31.892 --> 00:09:34.564
that are hard to accept.

00:09:34.664 --> 00:09:36.100
- Yeah. Lately it seems
like everything

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:39.574
in my life's been
hard to accept.

00:09:39.674 --> 00:09:43.181
- Then I guess you're
already figuring it out.

00:09:43.281 --> 00:09:44.818
As much as we'd like it to,

00:09:44.918 --> 00:09:49.561
justice doesn't always
prevail in this world.

00:09:49.661 --> 00:09:51.464
So if you don't want
to be disappointed

00:09:51.565 --> 00:09:56.174
you've gotta toughen up.
You've gotta get crafty.

00:09:56.274 --> 00:09:59.246
(piano music)

00:10:05.058 --> 00:10:09.768
If you can't take it, then
go back to the tirashomaen.

00:10:09.868 --> 00:10:13.241
(melancholy music)

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:17.817
- [Nana] When I turned
on the TV,

00:10:17.917 --> 00:10:22.761
I saw Ren swarmed by paparazzi
on all the talk shows.

00:10:22.861 --> 00:10:25.098
He was being rushed
silently through the lobby

00:10:25.198 --> 00:10:27.537
at Narita airport.

00:10:27.637 --> 00:10:32.881
It made me feel kind of left
behind and abandoned again.

00:10:34.618 --> 00:10:38.626
I had no idea where
he was going,

00:10:38.726 --> 00:10:42.767
and I didn't even know
what he was up to.

00:10:43.769 --> 00:10:45.405
I remembered us
talking about living

00:10:45.506 --> 00:10:49.046
in that warehouse loft
again someday.

00:10:49.146 --> 00:10:51.618
It seemed like a distant dream.

00:10:51.718 --> 00:10:53.589
One that was even less
likely to come true

00:10:53.689 --> 00:10:57.463
than my dream of making
it as a singer.

00:11:03.776 --> 00:11:07.784
- Hey Junko, where do
you think Ren's going,

00:11:07.884 --> 00:11:09.086
leaving Nana behind?

00:11:09.186 --> 00:11:11.658
- What I wanna know is how
long you plan on staying here.

00:11:11.758 --> 00:11:13.161
- They sent Ren overseas.

00:11:13.261 --> 00:11:16.835
Do you think that means Takumi
went too without telling me?

00:11:16.935 --> 00:11:17.770
- And Kyosuke, too.

00:11:17.871 --> 00:11:20.208
He told you to come over and
then he ran off to class.

00:11:20.308 --> 00:11:22.412
Men only think of themselves,
don't they?

00:11:22.514 --> 00:11:23.516
- Wonder when he's coming back?

00:11:23.616 --> 00:11:26.655
We never made up after
that fight we had.

00:11:26.755 --> 00:11:28.893
- Nana, you should go
back to your parents.

00:11:28.993 --> 00:11:31.297
That would be the best
for everyone involved.

00:11:31.397 --> 00:11:33.334
- No way! Not after Nana sent me

00:11:33.434 --> 00:11:36.440
that beautiful message
of encouragement.

00:11:36.542 --> 00:11:38.444
- That was a message of
encouragement, was it?

00:11:38.546 --> 00:11:39.581
- Nana's having such a hard
time,

00:11:39.681 --> 00:11:42.019
but she's making the
most of it, and so should I!

00:11:42.119 --> 00:11:43.556
I shall overcome!

00:11:43.656 --> 00:11:44.724
- Actually, the harder you try,

00:11:44.825 --> 00:11:46.895
the more problems you inflict
on everyone around you.

00:11:46.995 --> 00:11:49.366
So just give up and start
all over again.

00:11:49.466 --> 00:11:51.237
- Does this cell phone still
work in another country?

00:11:51.337 --> 00:11:52.807
Maybe I could still get a
hold of him.

00:11:52.907 --> 00:11:55.613
- And she isn't even
listening to me.

00:11:55.713 --> 00:11:57.282
- I can't wait to get to London.

00:11:57.382 --> 00:12:00.188
I wonder how Stella's doing.

00:12:00.288 --> 00:12:01.558
- Stella? Who's that?

00:12:01.658 --> 00:12:03.328
- Takumi's London lady.

00:12:03.428 --> 00:12:06.334
- A lady in London? Wow.
He's got a woman there?

00:12:06.434 --> 00:12:07.503
- And she's blonde.

00:12:07.604 --> 00:12:09.073
- A blonde?
- A blonde?

00:12:09.173 --> 00:12:10.275
- He has other women, too.

00:12:10.375 --> 00:12:11.612
- Yeah?
- He also has one in-

00:12:11.712 --> 00:12:14.416
- Hello? Takumi? I can't
believe I got through!

00:12:14.517 --> 00:12:15.620
(kids talking)

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.489
- Is something wrong?

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:20.596
- Well, I just wanted
to say I'm sorry.

00:12:20.696 --> 00:12:23.869
I said mean things to
you this morning.

00:12:23.969 --> 00:12:25.506
- This morning?

00:12:28.077 --> 00:12:30.516
(ding) (dog barking)

00:12:30.616 --> 00:12:32.152
- What do you mean, this mess?

00:12:32.252 --> 00:12:34.958
- You've got no part in this.

00:12:35.058 --> 00:12:36.360
Oh, right.

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:37.697
- That's all.

00:12:37.797 --> 00:12:40.101
I'm sorry to bother
you when you're so busy

00:12:40.201 --> 00:12:41.337
with your band stuff.

00:12:41.437 --> 00:12:46.748
(guitar music)
(sobbing)

00:12:48.619 --> 00:12:49.654
(phone ringing)

00:12:49.754 --> 00:12:51.625
- Hello?

00:12:51.725 --> 00:12:54.664
- Listen, Nana, I'm gonna
be flying to London tomorrow

00:12:54.764 --> 00:12:57.269
with the rest of the band.

00:12:57.369 --> 00:12:58.739
I'll email you the hotel's phone
number

00:12:58.839 --> 00:13:00.743
so you can reach me there
if you need to.

00:13:00.843 --> 00:13:04.216
They speak Japanese at the
front desk so, don't worry.

00:13:04.316 --> 00:13:06.287
- Tomorrow? For how long?

00:13:06.387 --> 00:13:08.926
- Well, for about two weeks.

00:13:09.026 --> 00:13:10.061
- Two weeks?

00:13:10.161 --> 00:13:12.767
- Come on, it's not that long.

00:13:12.867 --> 00:13:15.438
Even if I stayed here, we
wouldn't be able to see each
other

00:13:15.539 --> 00:13:17.276
with all this crap going on.

00:13:17.376 --> 00:13:18.545
So what does it matter?

00:13:18.646 --> 00:13:19.514
- But it does matter.

00:13:19.614 --> 00:13:21.685
It's not the same without you
here.

00:13:21.785 --> 00:13:26.060
- Oh, really? Well anyway,
that's what's gonna happen.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.933
So unfortunately, I won't
be able to meet your parents

00:13:29.033 --> 00:13:29.834
as planned.

00:13:29.935 --> 00:13:32.807
Please tell them what
happened and that I'm sorry.

00:13:32.907 --> 00:13:34.577
- Then maybe I'll go
back to my parents' place

00:13:34.678 --> 00:13:35.746
while you're in London.

00:13:35.846 --> 00:13:38.384
I'd be lonely just staying here.

00:13:38.484 --> 00:13:40.355
- Yeah, sure. You should
do that.

00:13:40.455 --> 00:13:42.192
So what is your
plan anyway?

00:13:42.292 --> 00:13:44.664
Are you gonna stay there and
raise the kid on your own?

00:13:44.764 --> 00:13:45.900
- No, I don't want that.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.904
I made up my mind that
no matter what happens

00:13:48.004 --> 00:13:50.576
the three of us are gonna
be one happy family.

00:13:50.676 --> 00:13:53.147
You, me, and the baby.

00:13:53.247 --> 00:13:57.055
- Huh. Just us three?
We can have more kids.

00:13:57.155 --> 00:14:00.195
- Come on. You don't just
have babies for no reason.

00:14:00.295 --> 00:14:03.067
But, please, you need to
compromise a bit more, k?

00:14:03.167 --> 00:14:05.138
For the kids' sake.

00:14:05.238 --> 00:14:10.148
- Sure. Okay. So I'll bring you
back something from England.

00:14:10.248 --> 00:14:11.985
Is there anything you want?

00:14:12.085 --> 00:14:14.156
- A diamond ring.

00:14:14.256 --> 00:14:15.893
- Oh yeah, that's right.

00:14:15.993 --> 00:14:18.498
I forgot I didn't get you
an engagement ring yet.

00:14:18.599 --> 00:14:19.534
Do you know your size?

00:14:19.634 --> 00:14:20.936
- Size four.

00:14:21.037 --> 00:14:22.139
- Got it.

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:25.011
(footsteps)

00:14:25.111 --> 00:14:28.017
- Oh, Jun! He's getting me an
engagement ring as a present!

00:14:28.117 --> 00:14:30.021
- Congratulations.

00:14:30.121 --> 00:14:33.361
- [Nana] Our dreams were
finally coming true.

00:14:33.461 --> 00:14:35.498
But the ideals we pursue
and the reality

00:14:35.599 --> 00:14:38.438
are always locked in
a stalemate.

00:14:38.539 --> 00:14:41.344
They don't get along
and nothing is ever

00:14:41.444 --> 00:14:43.114
as you imagined it would be.

00:14:43.214 --> 00:14:44.049
(knocking)

00:14:44.149 --> 00:14:45.185
- Huh?

00:14:47.557 --> 00:14:48.892
- Want one?

00:14:50.395 --> 00:14:52.499
- Nana, when you were on TV,

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.637
you said something to Hachi,
didn't you?

00:14:54.738 --> 00:14:55.773
- Yep. I sent her a secret
message

00:14:55.873 --> 00:14:57.844
that only she could
understand.

00:14:57.944 --> 00:15:01.117
- I've been getting tons of
emails asking who Hachiko is.

00:15:01.217 --> 00:15:03.956
It's worse than the
porno spam I usually get.

00:15:04.056 --> 00:15:05.993
- Oh, I'm sorry.

00:15:06.093 --> 00:15:07.295
- That's all right.

00:15:07.396 --> 00:15:12.039
To be safe, I told
everyone it's your pet dog.

00:15:12.139 --> 00:15:16.013
- I really am sorry. I keep
causing trouble for you.

00:15:16.113 --> 00:15:17.717
If you hadn't become
friends with me,

00:15:17.817 --> 00:15:19.286
just think of all the
crazy drama

00:15:19.386 --> 00:15:23.261
you wouldn't have
to deal with in your life.

00:15:23.361 --> 00:15:26.500
- It's cool though. This
is what I wanna be doing.

00:15:26.601 --> 00:15:28.071
Look at me. I'm living
in a story

00:15:28.171 --> 00:15:32.279
where I'm getting made fun
of by girls named Nana.

00:15:32.379 --> 00:15:33.849
- And what story would that be?

00:15:33.949 --> 00:15:36.020
- The Nobuo Diaries.
(chime ringing)

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:37.523
- So you're saying the
next female character

00:15:37.623 --> 00:15:39.828
who shows up will be
another Nana?

00:15:39.928 --> 00:15:44.871
- I don't think I could
handle another Nana.

00:15:44.971 --> 00:15:47.710
- I hate to tell you
this, but the truth is

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:52.920
I can't bring myself to erase
Hachi from my own story.

00:15:53.956 --> 00:15:55.926
- Yeah, the same goes for me.

00:15:56.026 --> 00:16:00.536
I doubt she'll ever
disappear from mine.

00:16:00.636 --> 00:16:04.711
But I got a feeling
I'm probably gone

00:16:04.811 --> 00:16:07.082
from Hachi's story now.

00:16:09.821 --> 00:16:13.796
- Hey Jun, look. The moon
is so beautiful tonight.

00:16:13.896 --> 00:16:14.731
- You're right, it is.

00:16:14.831 --> 00:16:16.267
So are you spending the
night here?

00:16:16.367 --> 00:16:17.537
- It's not quite full yet.

00:16:17.637 --> 00:16:19.173
I wonder when the next full
moon is?

00:16:19.273 --> 00:16:20.375
- 'Cause if
you're planning on staying over,

00:16:20.475 --> 00:16:22.680
I'll tell Kyosuke to stay
over at a friend's...

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:24.851
- You know what, Junko?

00:16:24.951 --> 00:16:26.855
It was the night of
the full moon,

00:16:26.955 --> 00:16:30.295
and it must have been the
happiest moment in my life.

00:16:30.395 --> 00:16:32.800
- Which night of the
full moon was that?

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:36.140
- It felt like I had everything
I ever wanted close to me.

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:39.480
My heart was full of
hopes and dreams.

00:16:39.581 --> 00:16:41.885
My future was shining brightly.

00:16:41.985 --> 00:16:43.822
Even if I tried really hard,

00:16:43.922 --> 00:16:49.333
I don't think I'll feel pure
happiness like that ever again.

00:16:52.807 --> 00:16:56.948
- With Hachi, I believed
I could do anything.

00:16:57.048 --> 00:17:00.054
But when the time came,
I was hopeless.

00:17:00.155 --> 00:17:04.296
I couldn't do anything
at all. I'm such a loser.

00:17:04.396 --> 00:17:05.431
The thing that I can't get over

00:17:05.533 --> 00:17:07.202
is she was really horrible
to me.

00:17:07.302 --> 00:17:11.143
So why the hell can't
I let go of her?

00:17:13.281 --> 00:17:17.155
- Maybe you don't need to do
that. Maybe there's still hope.

00:17:17.255 --> 00:17:17.957
- How?

00:17:18.057 --> 00:17:22.132
- All you gotta do is listen
to me and follow my plan.

00:17:22.232 --> 00:17:23.702
- What kind of plan?

00:17:23.802 --> 00:17:26.708
- It's called Operation
Get Hachiko Back.

00:17:26.808 --> 00:17:29.681
Once she's in our backyard,
you can mate with her.

00:17:29.781 --> 00:17:32.485
- God, you still talk about
her as if she's a dog.

00:17:32.587 --> 00:17:34.223
- Don't talk back, fight like
a man!

00:17:34.323 --> 00:17:38.497
- I don't need you to
tell me when I should fight.

00:17:38.599 --> 00:17:40.001
- Hmm.

00:17:42.607 --> 00:17:44.009
(rock music)

00:17:44.109 --> 00:17:49.453
My plan was simple. Keep
showing Hachi our sweet dreams.

00:17:49.554 --> 00:17:54.263
And as for Blast, we just had
to keep cool and look cool.

00:17:54.363 --> 00:17:57.168
And that way we'd stick
around in Hachi's story.

00:17:57.269 --> 00:18:02.379
That way she'd have to come back
for sure.

00:18:02.479 --> 00:18:07.155
That coldblooded man just
takes her for granted.

00:18:07.255 --> 00:18:13.502
He'll never be able to make
our little Hachiko happy.

00:18:13.602 --> 00:18:16.273
- Gaia plans to do everything
in our power to promote you,

00:18:16.373 --> 00:18:19.847
and that's a promise. We
have very high hopes for you.

00:18:19.948 --> 00:18:22.820
- We're all in this together.

00:18:25.893 --> 00:18:27.495
(snickering)

00:18:27.597 --> 00:18:28.799
- Nana.

00:18:33.441 --> 00:18:36.413
(clearing throat)

00:18:36.514 --> 00:18:39.654
- We plan to hit number
one with our first single.

00:18:39.754 --> 00:18:41.457
I think you'll enjoy the ride.

00:18:41.558 --> 00:18:44.496
(engine roaring)

00:18:45.666 --> 00:18:46.901
- Ren!

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:50.308
(rock music)

00:18:59.259 --> 00:19:00.461
- Take a look.

00:19:00.562 --> 00:19:01.430
- Nice tits!

00:19:01.531 --> 00:19:03.869
- No, not that you perv.

00:19:06.006 --> 00:19:08.044
- Beautiful woman?

00:19:08.144 --> 00:19:09.948
- The headline's ridiculous.

00:19:10.048 --> 00:19:12.820
But the rest of the article
is even worse.

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:14.489
I'm pretty sure these
guys started the whole

00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:15.592
media freak show.

00:19:15.693 --> 00:19:18.999
It looks like they have a
real crush on your woman, too.

00:19:19.099 --> 00:19:24.242
- Who wouldn't? I know
I really fell for her.

00:19:24.343 --> 00:19:27.950
- It seems like Gaia was pretty
eager to latch onto it, too.

00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:32.258
I've got a really bad
feeling about this.

00:19:32.359 --> 00:19:33.862
- Why is that?

00:19:35.098 --> 00:19:37.168
- Are you returning this?

00:19:37.268 --> 00:19:38.404
(giggling)

00:19:38.505 --> 00:19:39.607
Nana?

00:19:39.707 --> 00:19:41.143
- Long time, no see, Nakamura.

00:19:41.243 --> 00:19:43.014
When I came into rent
this, you weren't here

00:19:43.114 --> 00:19:45.819
so I thought maybe you'd
been fired.

00:19:45.919 --> 00:19:47.389
It's good to see you again.

00:19:47.489 --> 00:19:49.894
- Did you come back 'cause
you missed me?

00:19:49.994 --> 00:19:51.931
- Think you could
overlook my late fee on this?

00:19:52.032 --> 00:19:54.737
- No problem.
- Lucky me!

00:19:54.837 --> 00:19:56.073
I feel good today.

00:19:56.173 --> 00:19:58.779
Maybe I'll drop by the beauty
salon near the station.

00:19:58.879 --> 00:20:00.481
I hope it's still there.

00:20:00.582 --> 00:20:01.383
(phone ringing)

00:20:01.483 --> 00:20:04.891
- Hello? Ms. Hachiko? Big
news! Gaia set a release date!

00:20:04.991 --> 00:20:07.162
- Really? When is it?

00:20:09.834 --> 00:20:11.170
- Hey Mari.

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:11.538
- Hm?

00:20:11.638 --> 00:20:15.311
- I forgot. When's the release
date for our next single?

00:20:15.411 --> 00:20:18.585
- It's gonna be Wednesday,
October 31st.

00:20:18.685 --> 00:20:22.058
(melancholy music)

00:20:25.331 --> 00:20:29.172
(laughing)
- Uh huh.

00:20:31.043 --> 00:20:33.815
(laughing)

00:20:33.915 --> 00:20:37.255
(melancholy music)

00:20:43.735 --> 00:20:46.140
- [Nana] Hey Hachi.

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:50.214
I know I can't be the hero in
your story.

00:20:50.314 --> 00:20:53.889
I just can't do it anymore.

00:20:53.989 --> 00:20:58.464
But the heroin's name in
my story is still Nana.

00:20:58.565 --> 00:21:00.068
The cute Nana.

00:21:00.702 --> 00:21:02.272
You.

00:21:02.372 --> 00:21:04.977
(swishing)

00:22:17.957 --> 00:22:21.096
(slow footsteps)
