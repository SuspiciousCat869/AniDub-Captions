WEBVTT

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.874
- [Nana] I couldn't stand

00:00:04.974 --> 00:00:07.312
telling the little white
lies anymore.

00:00:07.412 --> 00:00:11.253
The bed is too small
or I forgot my wallet.

00:00:12.189 --> 00:00:14.661
When I was unbearably lonely,

00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:18.869
it wasn't Ren who I
wanted to have by my side.

00:00:20.606 --> 00:00:24.012
(upbeat rock music)

00:02:21.781 --> 00:02:23.484
- Wow.

00:02:23.585 --> 00:02:25.054
That girl's incredible.

00:02:25.155 --> 00:02:26.825
So where'd you find her?

00:02:26.925 --> 00:02:28.427
Oh, she's Ren's girl, isn't she?

00:02:28.529 --> 00:02:30.599
- Yeah, Nobuo knew
her from school

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:31.902
and introduced her to Ren.

00:02:32.002 --> 00:02:33.104
- She's so cool.

00:02:33.204 --> 00:02:35.509
She's hot and she's got an
amazing voice.

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:37.379
I really think you guys
have got a chance.

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:39.851
Now I see why you
decided to move down here

00:02:39.951 --> 00:02:41.187
and quit that law stuff.

00:02:41.287 --> 00:02:43.157
She's your secret weapon.

00:02:43.257 --> 00:02:46.531
- Well, I'm not so confident
we're gonna make it that big,

00:02:46.631 --> 00:02:49.938
but I think Nana has a really
good shot once she goes solo.

00:02:50.038 --> 00:02:52.442
- So that's what
you're trying to do.

00:02:53.077 --> 00:02:54.446
(doorbell rings)

00:02:54.547 --> 00:02:56.685
I wonder who it could
be this late at night.

00:02:56.785 --> 00:02:58.221
Reira? A new scandal uncovered?

00:02:58.321 --> 00:03:00.659
- Maybe it's a neighbor
complaining about the noise.

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:01.293
- Huh?

00:03:01.393 --> 00:03:02.830
Isn't this place soundproof?

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.634
Then how do you play your drums?

00:03:04.734 --> 00:03:08.809
- Hello. I apologize if
we're making too much noise.

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:10.478
- [Nana] Yasu...

00:03:11.781 --> 00:03:13.017
- Who is it?

00:03:13.685 --> 00:03:16.524
(Nana sobbing)

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.162
- What happened?

00:03:19.831 --> 00:03:22.637
(Nana sobbing)

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:29.316
- Yasu, I'm gonna go now.

00:03:29.416 --> 00:03:31.755
- Yeah, sorry about this.

00:03:31.855 --> 00:03:32.757
- Oh, no biggie.

00:03:32.857 --> 00:03:35.028
And thanks for the drinks.

00:03:35.596 --> 00:03:38.535
(doorbell rings)

00:03:42.877 --> 00:03:43.512
- [Narrator] Big scoop!

00:03:43.612 --> 00:03:46.518
Ren's girl showed up
at Yasu's flat crying!

00:03:46.618 --> 00:03:47.587
What's going on?

00:03:47.687 --> 00:03:48.421
Kyaaa!

00:03:48.522 --> 00:03:49.624
Papa-rakkyo!

00:03:49.724 --> 00:03:52.095
- Takumi got Hachiko pregnant
and it's gotta be him

00:03:52.195 --> 00:03:54.099
because Hachi told me
he didn't use condoms

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:55.201
when they were doing it.

00:03:55.301 --> 00:03:55.736
- What the hell!

00:03:55.836 --> 00:03:57.974
That loser didn't even
think to use a condom.

00:03:58.074 --> 00:03:59.611
- She ratted me out.

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:10.532
It's open.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.550
Nana, are you asleep?

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:25.361
Nana...

00:04:30.138 --> 00:04:31.340
It's me.

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.381
Don't scare me like that, damn
it!

00:05:08.481 --> 00:05:10.986
I told you, I'm a sensitive man.

00:05:11.086 --> 00:05:12.790
- And where's Nobuo?

00:05:39.977 --> 00:05:42.650
- Do you love him that much?

00:05:46.423 --> 00:05:49.329
You did break up with him,
didn't you?

00:05:55.074 --> 00:05:57.245
Please just make up an excuse.

00:05:57.345 --> 00:05:59.550
Do it for my sake.

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:01.888
Even if it's a lie,
I don't care.

00:06:01.988 --> 00:06:03.424
I'll believe anything.

00:06:10.038 --> 00:06:13.177
(doorbell rings)

00:06:21.761 --> 00:06:22.563
- Who is it?

00:06:22.663 --> 00:06:23.665
It's so late.

00:06:23.765 --> 00:06:26.336
- I can only think of
two people crazy enough

00:06:26.437 --> 00:06:28.842
to show up in the middle
of the night like this.

00:06:28.942 --> 00:06:30.979
- Yeah, I wonder which one.

00:06:32.315 --> 00:06:34.921
- Yes, where is it?

00:06:35.021 --> 00:06:36.256
- Jun.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.572
- I was in so much pain.

00:06:44.272 --> 00:06:46.544
I could hardly breathe.

00:06:46.644 --> 00:06:49.951
And before I knew it,
I was at his place.

00:06:51.955 --> 00:06:53.190
I told him everything,

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:55.596
like I was vomiting it all out.

00:06:55.696 --> 00:06:59.269
I have no idea whether I made
any sense.

00:06:59.369 --> 00:07:02.676
Why did I want Hachi so badly

00:07:02.777 --> 00:07:06.551
and why did I hate
Takumi so much?

00:07:06.651 --> 00:07:09.757
I didn't really
understand myself.

00:07:11.961 --> 00:07:14.867
Nobuo said that there's
something wrong with me.

00:07:15.769 --> 00:07:16.905
Is it true?

00:07:17.005 --> 00:07:18.340
Am I screwed up?

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:22.817
I just feel lost.

00:07:22.917 --> 00:07:27.025
What's a good friend supposed
to do at a time like this?

00:07:27.125 --> 00:07:28.929
I wanna be there for her.

00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:32.435
I really wanna be a
good friend to Hachi.

00:07:39.784 --> 00:07:44.059
Yasu listened to everything
that I had to say.

00:07:44.159 --> 00:07:44.660
Knowing him,

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:48.100
he probably said something
to comfort me here and there.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.739
But honestly, I don't remember.

00:07:52.008 --> 00:07:53.778
It's weird.

00:07:53.879 --> 00:07:56.283
What I do remember is the sweet
smell

00:07:56.383 --> 00:07:58.555
of his Blast
cigarettes.

00:07:59.289 --> 00:08:01.293
The smoke enveloped me

00:08:01.393 --> 00:08:03.999
and I could feel myself
calming down.

00:08:09.442 --> 00:08:11.413
- Kyosuke, don't smoke now.

00:08:11.514 --> 00:08:13.083
- Oh yeah, sorry.

00:08:14.119 --> 00:08:15.421
- I'm sorry, Kyosuke.

00:08:15.522 --> 00:08:17.526
- No, it's fine.

00:08:17.626 --> 00:08:19.697
Sometimes guys are just
pathetic.

00:08:19.797 --> 00:08:22.035
We get all fidgety at
times like this.

00:08:22.135 --> 00:08:25.074
- What reason do you have to
be fidgeting?

00:08:25.174 --> 00:08:26.711
- I know, I don't get it either.

00:08:26.811 --> 00:08:29.349
I just feel kind of bad
about it.

00:08:29.449 --> 00:08:32.422
On the other hand,
there's this Takumi guy.

00:08:32.523 --> 00:08:33.625
From what you've told us,

00:08:33.725 --> 00:08:36.363
he seems like the
decisive responsible type.

00:08:36.463 --> 00:08:37.733
I'm kind of impressed.

00:08:37.833 --> 00:08:38.267
- Really?

00:08:38.367 --> 00:08:42.208
I'd say he's more like a
coercive selfish control freak.

00:08:42.308 --> 00:08:43.043
- You think?

00:08:43.143 --> 00:08:43.612
- I mean, come on.

00:08:43.712 --> 00:08:46.316
He used Nana's phone to call
Nobuo and drop this bomb.

00:08:46.416 --> 00:08:50.324
Of course Nobuo's first reaction
was to totally freak out.

00:08:50.424 --> 00:08:51.895
I'm sure he did it to
scare Nobuo off

00:08:51.995 --> 00:08:53.999
and force him out of
the picture.

00:08:54.099 --> 00:08:54.867
And Takumi locked the door,

00:08:54.967 --> 00:08:57.405
so Nana couldn't do
anything about it.

00:08:57.506 --> 00:08:59.109
If he really cared about Nana,

00:08:59.209 --> 00:09:00.779
he wouldn't do that kind
of crap.

00:09:00.879 --> 00:09:02.783
He's the type of
guy who manipulates others

00:09:02.883 --> 00:09:05.889
without giving it a second
thought just to get his own way.

00:09:05.989 --> 00:09:08.628
- Even so, if he really
calculated all that on the spur

00:09:08.728 --> 00:09:11.601
of the moment, then you've
gotta admit he's one smart dude.

00:09:11.701 --> 00:09:14.372
To be honest, I kind
of admire him.

00:09:14.472 --> 00:09:17.278
- Well, I'm pretty sure
Takumi hadn't thought

00:09:17.378 --> 00:09:18.615
about all of that.

00:09:18.715 --> 00:09:20.786
I think he was just jealous

00:09:20.886 --> 00:09:24.459
'cause I said Nobuo
was my boyfriend.

00:09:25.328 --> 00:09:27.131
- Oh, they're fighting over you.

00:09:27.231 --> 00:09:29.804
- No, it's just that
Takumi has a lot of pride.

00:09:29.904 --> 00:09:33.745
- You call that pride?
Sounds pretty immature to me.

00:09:33.845 --> 00:09:36.684
Like a kid who's gotten
his toy taken away.

00:09:37.519 --> 00:09:38.320
- Yeah, maybe

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:41.126
- Maybe.

00:09:41.226 --> 00:09:43.965
- Anyway. He's gotta be
pretty serious about this

00:09:44.065 --> 00:09:45.434
to say he'll take
care of the kid

00:09:45.535 --> 00:09:46.838
no matter who the father is.

00:09:46.938 --> 00:09:48.642
- He went to school
with Yasu, right?

00:09:48.742 --> 00:09:50.712
That means he's
like 23 or 24.

00:09:50.812 --> 00:09:52.415
Will he be able to support you?

00:09:52.516 --> 00:09:54.419
What does he do for a living?

00:09:56.724 --> 00:09:58.060
- He's a musician.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.033
- What the hell! Does
the guy make any money?

00:10:02.569 --> 00:10:04.272
Why are you being so quiet?

00:10:04.372 --> 00:10:06.811
- Well, if he was the one who
offered to support the kid,

00:10:06.911 --> 00:10:09.249
then he's gotta have
some sort of income.

00:10:09.349 --> 00:10:10.752
- I don't like the way
you keep saying

00:10:10.852 --> 00:10:12.523
he's gonna support the kid,

00:10:12.623 --> 00:10:14.660
like he'll just be
handing her money.

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.700
- I think that's what
he plans to do.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:18.835
- Huh?

00:10:20.171 --> 00:10:21.106
- What the hell?

00:10:21.206 --> 00:10:22.475
Why won't he marry you?

00:10:22.576 --> 00:10:23.511
Is he married?

00:10:23.611 --> 00:10:24.714
Is this another affair?

00:10:24.814 --> 00:10:26.617
- No, but getting married

00:10:26.718 --> 00:10:28.722
would be a real
inconvenience for him.

00:10:28.822 --> 00:10:31.360
I don't wanna force
him into anything.

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:32.395
- I just don't get you.

00:10:32.495 --> 00:10:34.432
You're really okay with that?

00:10:34.533 --> 00:10:36.169
- It's enough for me.

00:10:40.646 --> 00:10:43.083
- So you want this baby
that much?

00:10:44.787 --> 00:10:49.229
- Well, at first I hoped
it was just my imagination.

00:10:49.329 --> 00:10:52.836
I was avoiding the truth
by not thinking about it,

00:10:52.936 --> 00:10:55.107
but there were signs
that I couldn't ignore.

00:10:55.207 --> 00:10:56.577
So I started to worry.

00:10:56.678 --> 00:10:59.049
But when the pregnancy
test turned out positive,

00:10:59.149 --> 00:11:01.888
I really freaked 'cause
it was like I had nowhere

00:11:01.988 --> 00:11:04.760
to run anymore and I was
scared to go to the clinic,

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:07.065
but I thought I should
get an abortion soon

00:11:07.165 --> 00:11:08.835
if I was pregnant.

00:11:09.904 --> 00:11:12.275
I thought I could just
go on like before

00:11:12.375 --> 00:11:14.112
as if nothing had happened

00:11:14.212 --> 00:11:17.853
if I had an abortion
and didn't tell anyone.

00:11:17.953 --> 00:11:18.688
(Nana sobbing)

00:11:18.788 --> 00:11:21.828
But at the clinic,
I saw the sonogram.

00:11:21.928 --> 00:11:24.032
I saw the little baby
that's inside me

00:11:24.132 --> 00:11:27.539
and suddenly it all felt
so real to me.

00:11:29.977 --> 00:11:31.647
I didn't want to just get an
abortion

00:11:31.748 --> 00:11:33.752
and go on like nothing happened.

00:11:33.852 --> 00:11:35.789
All my fears and
worries left me.

00:11:35.889 --> 00:11:40.197
And I knew I just needed
to pull myself together.

00:11:44.573 --> 00:11:47.211
I don't know how to explain it.

00:11:47.311 --> 00:11:49.617
I just felt attached to the baby

00:11:49.717 --> 00:11:53.323
and started thinking
of how I could do this.

00:11:53.424 --> 00:11:54.794
Could I become a single mother

00:11:54.894 --> 00:11:57.566
and raise this baby on my own?

00:11:57.666 --> 00:12:00.104
But the truth is
I don't have money

00:12:00.204 --> 00:12:01.574
and I can't go to work

00:12:01.674 --> 00:12:04.513
because my morning
sickness is so bad.

00:12:04.613 --> 00:12:06.083
I was at a total loss.

00:12:06.183 --> 00:12:10.792
There was no way I was
gonna make it through this.

00:12:10.892 --> 00:12:14.165
So when Takumi came over and
said all that, I was shocked,

00:12:14.265 --> 00:12:16.002
but also a little happy.

00:12:16.103 --> 00:12:18.842
Maybe I shouldn't be so
dependent on him, but,

00:12:18.942 --> 00:12:20.779
- No, it's fine for you to be
that way.

00:12:20.879 --> 00:12:22.916
It's probably his
baby anyway, right?

00:12:23.016 --> 00:12:25.522
- You said Nobuo used
protection every time, right?

00:12:25.622 --> 00:12:27.860
So chances are, it's not his.

00:12:28.628 --> 00:12:30.665
- I just feel so evil.

00:12:32.301 --> 00:12:32.870
It's true.

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:35.374
Nobuo always used condoms.

00:12:35.474 --> 00:12:38.615
He treated me like I
was so precious.

00:12:39.984 --> 00:12:41.788
And now I'm tramping
all over that

00:12:41.888 --> 00:12:45.427
and running to Takumi
to have the baby.

00:12:45.529 --> 00:12:49.035
Is there any way to
forgive such selfishness?

00:12:49.135 --> 00:12:51.774
(Nana sobbing)

00:12:51.874 --> 00:12:54.312
- Well, Nobuo might not
be able to forgive you.

00:12:54.412 --> 00:12:55.181
From how it all went down,

00:12:55.281 --> 00:12:57.619
he probably thinks you were
dating both him and Takumi

00:12:57.719 --> 00:12:59.389
at the same time.

00:12:59.489 --> 00:13:01.594
- Yeah, I think that's
the one thing

00:13:01.694 --> 00:13:02.863
that ought to be cleared up.

00:13:02.963 --> 00:13:03.731
- How could she do that?

00:13:03.832 --> 00:13:05.201
She can't prove any of it.

00:13:05.301 --> 00:13:09.142
And even if she did explain,
why would he believe her?

00:13:09.242 --> 00:13:09.710
- Look, all I'm saying

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:12.281
is that if I were in
Nobuo's position,

00:13:12.381 --> 00:13:15.822
chances are, I'd probably want
Nana to explain things to me

00:13:15.922 --> 00:13:17.626
just to show that she cares.

00:13:17.726 --> 00:13:19.730
You never know, that
might even encourage him

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:21.500
to do something about all of
this.

00:13:21.601 --> 00:13:22.235
- For his own
sake,

00:13:22.335 --> 00:13:25.207
it might be better not to
have such encouragement

00:13:25.307 --> 00:13:28.113
because you can't raise
a kid on love alone.

00:13:28.213 --> 00:13:31.453
He'll probably have to give up
all his dreams as a musician,

00:13:31.554 --> 00:13:35.227
then quit the band and take
over his family's hotel,

00:13:35.327 --> 00:13:38.000
all for Nana's sake.

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:41.006
- I'll do whatever it
takes to make you happy.

00:13:43.277 --> 00:13:47.351
- That'd be one thing if the
baby was his, but he's only 20.

00:13:47.451 --> 00:13:48.353
That would be pretty cruel

00:13:48.453 --> 00:13:52.028
to have his whole life
determined by this.

00:13:52.128 --> 00:13:55.201
That's why in the end
you didn't choose Nobuo.

00:13:55.301 --> 00:13:56.704
Right, Nana?

00:13:56.804 --> 00:13:59.409
And you can't tell him that.

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:03.150
- Nana, you're completely in
love with Nobuo, aren't you?

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:05.154
- It's more than just
being in love with him.

00:14:05.254 --> 00:14:08.193
She's also deeply
in love with Blast.

00:14:08.293 --> 00:14:12.268
The success of the guru's band
is a dream of hers as well.

00:14:12.368 --> 00:14:15.107
(Nana sobbing)

00:14:15.207 --> 00:14:17.913
- Life doesn't always
go as planned, does it?

00:14:18.013 --> 00:14:20.384
Maybe there really is
a Demon Lord.

00:14:20.484 --> 00:14:21.520
- Quit talking crazy.

00:14:21.621 --> 00:14:22.154
It's Nana's fault

00:14:22.255 --> 00:14:24.693
for not insisting that
Takumi use condoms.

00:14:24.793 --> 00:14:26.363
And she slept with Nobuo
right after that.

00:14:26.463 --> 00:14:29.803
This is what you get for
sleeping around and being
careless.

00:14:29.904 --> 00:14:32.041
Do you understand what I'm
telling you?

00:14:32.141 --> 00:14:32.609
(Nana sobbing)

00:14:32.709 --> 00:14:34.947
- I don't think you should
be lecturing her right now.

00:14:35.047 --> 00:14:36.349
- This might be the only time

00:14:36.449 --> 00:14:38.220
Nana will actually listen to me.

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:38.922
Do you understand

00:14:39.022 --> 00:14:41.493
what it's gonna be like to
raise a child on your own?

00:14:41.594 --> 00:14:42.729
Getting financial support

00:14:42.829 --> 00:14:45.401
from a man who won't
even marry you.

00:14:47.739 --> 00:14:48.240
All right, then.

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:49.743
You're going to have to be
connected

00:14:49.843 --> 00:14:53.250
to that man for the
rest of your life.

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:55.755
And you'll have to
break up with Nobuo.

00:14:55.855 --> 00:14:57.759
Are you prepared to do that?

00:14:59.897 --> 00:15:02.001
I want to hear your answer!

00:15:02.101 --> 00:15:02.401
- Yes.

00:15:02.502 --> 00:15:04.573
- And if the baby is
actually Nobuo's,

00:15:04.673 --> 00:15:05.942
are you prepared to still
love it

00:15:06.042 --> 00:15:08.313
and raise it as though
it were Takumi's?

00:15:08.413 --> 00:15:10.652
Even though Takumi will
support you and the baby,

00:15:10.752 --> 00:15:14.259
that doesn't guarantee he's
gonna love either of you.

00:15:15.562 --> 00:15:16.864
- I know.

00:15:20.471 --> 00:15:20.939
- All right, then.

00:15:21.039 --> 00:15:22.809
If you wanna have
the baby that bad,

00:15:22.909 --> 00:15:24.279
I won't say anything else.

00:15:24.379 --> 00:15:27.753
But don't you ever
forget it was your decision.

00:15:27.853 --> 00:15:28.755
- Okay.

00:15:28.855 --> 00:15:30.124
- Now that you've made that
commitment,

00:15:30.224 --> 00:15:32.729
I don't wanna ever
see you crying over this.

00:15:32.829 --> 00:15:34.833
The world doesn't need
another kid raised

00:15:34.933 --> 00:15:36.938
by a messed up depressed mother.

00:15:37.038 --> 00:15:39.375
Try to be like your own mom.

00:15:39.475 --> 00:15:42.315
(Nana sobbing)

00:15:50.532 --> 00:15:51.299
- Okay, bye.

00:15:51.399 --> 00:15:52.034
Thanks Jun.

00:15:52.134 --> 00:15:53.036
Thanks Kyosuke, for everything.

00:15:53.136 --> 00:15:55.608
It really helped to
talk to you about this.

00:15:55.709 --> 00:15:57.044
I'll be in touch.

00:15:57.144 --> 00:15:59.082
- Just take good care of
yourself.

00:15:59.182 --> 00:15:59.817
Okay?

00:15:59.917 --> 00:16:01.219
- Stay strong.

00:16:10.371 --> 00:16:12.341
- I can't believe she's
having a baby.

00:16:12.441 --> 00:16:14.947
This doesn't just affect
the rest of her life.

00:16:15.047 --> 00:16:16.584
It affects the kid's life too.

00:16:16.684 --> 00:16:19.155
I'm so worried I could puke.

00:16:20.692 --> 00:16:23.731
- But it seems Nana's made
up her mind about this.

00:16:23.831 --> 00:16:26.069
So I think we should ease
off of it now.

00:16:26.169 --> 00:16:28.808
What we can do now is
be supportive of her.

00:16:28.908 --> 00:16:29.743
- Yeah, you're right.

00:16:29.843 --> 00:16:31.714
It's just that Nana's
dream was always

00:16:31.814 --> 00:16:35.120
to be a normal housewife.

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:38.995
If she'd had the abortion, she
could have stayed with Nobuo.

00:16:39.095 --> 00:16:41.634
And it might have all
worked out for her.

00:16:41.734 --> 00:16:45.508
Instead, she's sacrificing
that to have this baby.

00:16:46.309 --> 00:16:48.815
So she must be really determined

00:16:50.618 --> 00:16:51.887
- As her dad, I would've loved

00:16:51.987 --> 00:16:53.791
to have seen Nana in a
wedding dress.

00:16:53.891 --> 00:16:55.260
- Dad, you say?

00:16:55.361 --> 00:16:58.300
- Why do you think Takumi
won't marry her anyway?

00:16:58.400 --> 00:16:59.770
- 'Cause it'd be harder
to take care

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:02.308
of Nana than it would be
to support a kid.

00:17:02.408 --> 00:17:03.511
- Good point.

00:17:09.188 --> 00:17:09.757
- Oh no.

00:17:09.857 --> 00:17:11.059
My keys.

00:17:24.853 --> 00:17:26.056
- Nana!

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:30.497
- Damn, I fell asleep.

00:17:30.598 --> 00:17:31.634
Welcome home.

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:38.514
So, where'd you go without
even locking the door?

00:17:38.614 --> 00:17:40.384
I was worried.

00:17:40.484 --> 00:17:42.956
Did you work things
out with Nobuo?

00:17:43.056 --> 00:17:44.860
- Yeah, sorry.

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:46.797
I thought you'd gone
home already.

00:17:46.897 --> 00:17:47.699
- No, no.

00:17:47.799 --> 00:17:49.135
I went to the store.

00:17:49.235 --> 00:17:51.540
You want some grapefruit juice?

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:52.241
Oh man.

00:17:52.341 --> 00:17:54.580
Should have put it
in the fridge.

00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:02.361
- Yasu, mind if I smoke one?

00:18:02.461 --> 00:18:02.996
- Go ahead.

00:18:03.096 --> 00:18:05.134
- Quitting smoking is
harder than I thought.

00:18:05.234 --> 00:18:07.973
I just can't do this
whole stoic thing anymore.

00:18:08.073 --> 00:18:10.845
So many things have been
stressing me out lately.

00:18:10.945 --> 00:18:12.148
- Well, there you go.

00:18:12.248 --> 00:18:13.216
You can't be perfect.

00:18:13.316 --> 00:18:15.254
So don't attempt the impossible.

00:18:15.354 --> 00:18:17.024
- Shouldn't you be telling me
not to smoke

00:18:17.124 --> 00:18:18.360
because it's bad for my health?

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:22.168
- I can't tell someone to do
something I can't do myself.

00:18:29.449 --> 00:18:30.184
So how is it?

00:18:30.284 --> 00:18:31.654
- Tastes like crap.

00:18:31.754 --> 00:18:33.490
(Yasu laughs)

00:18:33.591 --> 00:18:34.560
Well, I'm gonna bounce.

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:36.564
The first train should be
running soon.

00:18:36.664 --> 00:18:37.131
- Huh?

00:18:37.231 --> 00:18:40.270
- Sorry for busting in
on you and Naoki earlier.

00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:41.640
Are you guys an item now?

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:42.274
- Nah.

00:18:42.374 --> 00:18:44.178
- I think you might have
gotten the wrong idea.

00:18:44.278 --> 00:18:46.015
But tell him I said hi.

00:18:47.418 --> 00:18:49.055
- Is everything okay, Nana?

00:18:49.155 --> 00:18:50.658
- Huh? What do you mean?

00:18:53.531 --> 00:18:54.332
I'm just fine.

00:18:54.432 --> 00:18:56.570
I'm not that messed up, dude.

00:18:57.404 --> 00:18:58.073
I'm serious.

00:18:58.173 --> 00:18:59.242
I'll be fine.

00:18:59.342 --> 00:19:01.680
I still don't quite
understand what being

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:03.985
a real friend is all about.

00:19:04.085 --> 00:19:05.855
But no matter what Hachi
decides to do,

00:19:05.955 --> 00:19:10.197
I won't get in the way and
I'll gently watch over her,

00:19:10.297 --> 00:19:13.003
exactly like you do with me.

00:19:14.506 --> 00:19:17.211
- It's not as easy as it
looks, you know.

00:19:19.883 --> 00:19:21.787
(gentle pensive music)

00:19:21.887 --> 00:19:25.494
- I'm sorry, Yasu,
but thank you.

00:19:26.597 --> 00:19:27.699
Don't worry.

00:19:27.799 --> 00:19:29.135
Everything will be fine

00:19:29.235 --> 00:19:32.241
because Hachi and I have
that female bond.

00:19:32.341 --> 00:19:35.748
But maybe that's what
makes things difficult.

00:19:37.418 --> 00:19:39.923
- So I have to start recording
today.

00:19:40.023 --> 00:19:41.392
- Oh, sorry.

00:19:41.492 --> 00:19:42.194
- No, it's cool.

00:19:42.294 --> 00:19:43.631
We start in the afternoon.

00:19:43.731 --> 00:19:47.238
But I'll be held up in
the studio for a week.

00:19:47.338 --> 00:19:51.145
But before I go, could you let
me know what you've decided?

00:19:51.814 --> 00:19:52.916
- Huh?

00:19:53.016 --> 00:19:53.951
- Or else there's no way

00:19:54.051 --> 00:19:56.022
I'll be able to
concentrate on my work.

00:19:56.122 --> 00:19:58.426
Sorry for being so pushy.

00:20:03.103 --> 00:20:07.211
- I think I wanna have this baby
and raise it as your child

00:20:07.311 --> 00:20:09.415
if that's alright with you.

00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:17.866
- Want to get married?

00:20:17.966 --> 00:20:18.868
- Huh?

00:20:18.968 --> 00:20:22.007
- You don't wanna raise it
as an illegitimate child.

00:20:22.107 --> 00:20:24.211
And if the public finds
out, it'll just look bad

00:20:24.312 --> 00:20:26.182
no matter how we try to spin it.

00:20:26.282 --> 00:20:29.255
But I have no problem
getting married.

00:20:30.424 --> 00:20:32.094
If I marry an ordinary girl,

00:20:32.194 --> 00:20:34.432
the media might not go as crazy.

00:20:37.906 --> 00:20:39.108
You don't wanna?

00:20:50.665 --> 00:20:53.671
- No matter what kind of
life you choose to live,

00:20:53.771 --> 00:20:57.545
as long as you're happy,
it'll be fine with me.

00:20:57.646 --> 00:21:01.720
I might never truly believe
that with all of my heart.

00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:05.962
But still, I at least wanted
to appear strong and elegant

00:21:06.062 --> 00:21:07.431
in your eyes,

00:21:09.468 --> 00:21:13.611
just like a manga heroin
who's too perfect to be real.
