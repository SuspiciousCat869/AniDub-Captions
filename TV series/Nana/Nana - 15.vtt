00:00:03.525 --> 00:00:05.563
- [Nana K.] It's May already,

00:00:05.663 --> 00:00:08.835
but at night the wind still
feels so cold.

00:00:08.936 --> 00:00:12.877
It's a lot like my
hometown in the mountains.

00:00:12.977 --> 00:00:15.883
I always thought Tokyo would be
different.

00:00:15.983 --> 00:00:19.256
I had imagined it being
a much warmer place.

00:00:19.356 --> 00:00:22.763
(upbeat rock music)

00:01:57.653 --> 00:02:03.397
(soft somber music)
(dishes clattering softly)

00:02:04.032 --> 00:02:07.540
(cars roaring softly)

00:02:20.431 --> 00:02:21.835
- [Nana O.] We're still in
Tokyo,

00:02:21.935 --> 00:02:23.170
but it feels like the country.

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.743
- Yeah, don't you think there's
something weird going on

00:02:25.843 --> 00:02:27.045
with the weather?

00:02:27.145 --> 00:02:28.280
One day it's hot like summer,

00:02:28.381 --> 00:02:32.055
and the next it's so cold
it feels like winter again.

00:02:32.155 --> 00:02:35.662
- The earth is screwed up. It's
literally gonna fall apart.

00:02:35.763 --> 00:02:36.765
It scares me.

00:02:36.865 --> 00:02:38.200
- You're what scares me, Shin.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.906
You're gonna go straight to
hell, you know that, right?

00:02:41.006 --> 00:02:42.075
- Why is that?

00:02:42.175 --> 00:02:44.479
(Nana K. sneezing)

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.883
(phone chiming)

00:02:45.983 --> 00:02:47.586
Oh, I guess that's mine.

00:02:48.722 --> 00:02:52.362
Hi, this is Shin. Oh, hi Mayumi.

00:02:52.462 --> 00:02:56.103
Yeah, I think that should
be okay. Where are you?

00:02:56.738 --> 00:02:58.074
Roppongi?

00:02:58.174 --> 00:03:01.413
Not really, but I'm kinda stuck
out in the burbs right now.

00:03:01.514 --> 00:03:02.215
- Huh?

00:03:02.315 --> 00:03:05.388
- You'll pay the cab fair for
me? Really?

00:03:05.488 --> 00:03:09.530
Well okay then. I'll be right
over.

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.570
Sorry ladies, I've got
some business to attend to,

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:13.972
so I'm gonna have to go.

00:03:14.072 --> 00:03:16.310
- Oh, well take care of
yourself and have a nice time.

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.817
- Shin, I don't really care
how you live your life,

00:03:19.917 --> 00:03:21.086
but don't you dare do anything

00:03:21.186 --> 00:03:22.923
that's gonna give the band a bad
rap.

00:03:23.023 --> 00:03:25.161
- Nana.
- Huh?

00:03:25.261 --> 00:03:27.065
- Shin's only 15, you
can't talk to him like that

00:03:27.165 --> 00:03:28.033
or you'll push him away.

00:03:28.134 --> 00:03:29.469
You gotta be more gentle with
him.

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.210
What if he runs off and joins
a biker gang or something?

00:03:36.016 --> 00:03:37.085
(dramatic emotional music)

00:03:37.185 --> 00:03:39.122
Listen to me Shin,

00:03:39.222 --> 00:03:42.061
I've got no idea why you
decided to run away from home,

00:03:42.162 --> 00:03:43.063
but I'm guessing things

00:03:43.164 --> 00:03:45.903
must have been really hard for
you there.

00:03:47.573 --> 00:03:50.144
Your stepmother must have been
so mean.

00:03:50.244 --> 00:03:51.548
- My stepmother?
- It's okay.

00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:54.352
I won't make you talk about
it if it's too painful.

00:03:54.453 --> 00:03:55.188
Poor Shin.

00:03:55.288 --> 00:03:57.626
But you have to understand one
thing.

00:03:57.726 --> 00:04:01.534
Underestimate us women,
and you're gonna get hurt.

00:04:01.634 --> 00:04:03.170
(wind whooshing)

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.943
- [Shin] Okay. I promise I'll be
careful.

00:04:06.511 --> 00:04:09.282
(car roaring)

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:12.355
- Well, that should do it.
- Should do what?

00:04:12.455 --> 00:04:14.226
What makes you think anything's
changed?

00:04:14.326 --> 00:04:16.263
He's not gonna listen to advice
from you.

00:04:16.363 --> 00:04:18.100
- Advice? I wasn't giving him
advice.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.169
I was warning him.

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.941
- Yeah, well I'm outta here.
I gotta work in the morning.

00:04:22.041 --> 00:04:22.977
(Nana K. gasping)

00:04:23.077 --> 00:04:26.083
- Nana. Don't go home
yet, stay here with me.

00:04:26.183 --> 00:04:28.487
What'll I do here all by myself?

00:04:28.588 --> 00:04:29.824
- You're not seriously gonna
wait

00:04:29.924 --> 00:04:31.728
for Shoji to get off work, are
you?

00:04:31.828 --> 00:04:33.765
He's gonna be at least another
hour.

00:04:33.865 --> 00:04:34.299
- Yeah, but-

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:36.370
- Anyway, what's the point in
waiting?

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:37.940
He said he was gonna come over
later.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.608
- I know.

00:04:38.708 --> 00:04:41.246
But Jun told me I have to try
harder to show him I care.

00:04:41.346 --> 00:04:43.852
- Alright, fine, let's
wait for him inside then.

00:04:43.952 --> 00:04:45.989
- No, that's too obvious.

00:04:46.089 --> 00:04:46.691
He told me not to wait,

00:04:46.791 --> 00:04:49.129
so I don't wanna look
like some weirdo stalker.

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:51.266
- Well, in that case let's go
home.

00:04:51.366 --> 00:04:53.137
- No, I wanna make him think I
went home

00:04:53.237 --> 00:04:54.974
so when he sees I actually
waited for him

00:04:55.074 --> 00:04:56.744
he'll be totally impressed with
me.

00:04:56.845 --> 00:04:57.880
- That's stupid.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:58.648
(Nana K. gasping)

00:04:58.748 --> 00:05:01.988
- You don't understand what
it's like to be a woman in love.

00:05:02.088 --> 00:05:02.790
- You're right, I don't.

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.598
I hate all the manipulative
crap that goes along with it.

00:05:09.102 --> 00:05:10.037
If you're gonna wait for him,

00:05:10.137 --> 00:05:12.075
wait because you love
him and no other reason

00:05:12.175 --> 00:05:14.747
and then I'll stay here with
you.

00:05:14.847 --> 00:05:16.618
- Well, of course.

00:05:16.718 --> 00:05:19.289
That's the most obvious reason
why I would wait for him.

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:22.328
- Then stop playing games.

00:05:22.428 --> 00:05:25.702
Just wag your tail quietly and
wait.

00:05:26.336 --> 00:05:29.744
(footsteps tapping)

00:05:31.079 --> 00:05:32.883
(soft somber music)

00:05:32.983 --> 00:05:37.626
I hate all the manipulative
crap that goes along with it.

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:42.603
(Nana K. sneezing)

00:05:43.805 --> 00:05:47.111
(jacket rustling)

00:05:48.848 --> 00:05:52.355
- Nana. Here, I don't
want you to catch a cold.

00:05:52.455 --> 00:05:54.359
- I'm not as fragile as you.

00:05:54.459 --> 00:05:56.496
Besides, it's not that cold
anyway.

00:05:56.598 --> 00:05:58.969
- Are you kidding? It's freezing
tonight.

00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:01.039
- Compared to what it's like
back home,

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:03.310
Tokyo's a tropical paradise.

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:06.483
We were buried in snow for half
a year.

00:06:07.686 --> 00:06:10.659
- [Nana K.] So that's
what her hometown is like.

00:06:14.132 --> 00:06:17.071
One day I'd like to see where
she grew up.

00:06:20.077 --> 00:06:23.083
Thanks for the jacket. It's nice
and warm.

00:06:23.752 --> 00:06:25.354
- [Nana O.] Mhm.

00:06:27.091 --> 00:06:28.762
- You know when Shoji said

00:06:28.862 --> 00:06:30.431
he needed to talk to me?

00:06:31.501 --> 00:06:33.705
It sounded kinda serious.

00:06:33.805 --> 00:06:36.778
There was something in his
voice that got me worried.

00:06:36.878 --> 00:06:39.684
And that's the reason
I didn't wanna go home.

00:06:40.719 --> 00:06:43.858
Thanks, Nana, for waiting with
me.

00:06:43.959 --> 00:06:48.200
(soft somber music continues)

00:06:57.085 --> 00:07:00.391
(Nana O. humming)

00:07:02.563 --> 00:07:06.436
I just didn't feel like
talking, so instead I listened

00:07:06.537 --> 00:07:09.977
to some song Nana was humming to
herself.

00:07:10.077 --> 00:07:12.583
Nana's eyes were so clear.

00:07:13.752 --> 00:07:15.555
They were eyes that seemed to
fit better

00:07:15.656 --> 00:07:18.995
with snow topped mountains
than in the city,

00:07:19.095 --> 00:07:21.501
where you can't even see the
stars.

00:07:24.573 --> 00:07:28.380
She was right. I was being
manipulative.

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:30.251
Why couldn't I just wait for
Shoji

00:07:30.351 --> 00:07:33.157
without expecting something in
return?

00:07:33.257 --> 00:07:36.430
I wasn't as naive as
everyone thought I was.

00:07:36.531 --> 00:07:39.069
But I sure pretended to be,

00:07:39.169 --> 00:07:41.774
because I wanted Nana to like
me.

00:07:43.177 --> 00:07:44.079
(locker thudding)

00:07:44.179 --> 00:07:46.483
- I'm goin' home. See ya later.

00:07:48.755 --> 00:07:49.790
- Huh?

00:07:51.995 --> 00:07:53.230
- Uh.

00:07:54.466 --> 00:07:58.407
(Sachiko moaning softly)

00:08:00.177 --> 00:08:03.183
(Shoji sighing)

00:08:03.283 --> 00:08:06.423
(Shoji grunting)

00:08:08.628 --> 00:08:09.730
- Sachiko.

00:08:13.538 --> 00:08:15.207
I'm gonna break up with my
girlfriend.

00:08:15.307 --> 00:08:16.176
(Sachiko sobbing)

00:08:16.276 --> 00:08:17.311
Hey.

00:08:17.412 --> 00:08:19.149
(lighter clicking)

00:08:19.249 --> 00:08:20.217
(Nana O. exhaling)
(door slamming)

00:08:20.317 --> 00:08:22.523
- Huh, looks like they're
closing up.

00:08:22.623 --> 00:08:24.059
They're startin' to leave.

00:08:24.159 --> 00:08:25.762
- Finally.

00:08:25.862 --> 00:08:26.898
- [Shoji] Sachiko!

00:08:26.998 --> 00:08:30.806
(dramatic poignant music)

00:08:35.314 --> 00:08:38.621
(Sachiko gasping)

00:08:39.355 --> 00:08:41.460
- [Nana K.] What the?

00:08:41.561 --> 00:08:42.596
- Huh?

00:08:48.073 --> 00:08:51.113
(Sachiko gasping)

00:08:51.213 --> 00:08:53.785
- [Nana K.] No. That girl.

00:08:55.187 --> 00:08:56.591
- I'm sorry.

00:08:56.691 --> 00:09:00.732
- [Nana K.] He said Sachiko.
This is like a bad dream.

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:07.613
- [Nana O.] What are you
doing, Shoji? Who's this girl?

00:09:14.927 --> 00:09:18.233
(Sachiko sobbing)

00:09:24.814 --> 00:09:26.149
- My girlfriend.

00:09:26.249 --> 00:09:27.185
- What?

00:09:27.285 --> 00:09:28.153
(Sachiko gasping)

00:09:28.253 --> 00:09:32.563
Hold on! Are you telling me
you've got two girlfriends?

00:09:33.197 --> 00:09:34.967
Boy, what a lucky guy.

00:09:35.067 --> 00:09:37.606
- [Nana K.] No, this can't be.

00:09:37.706 --> 00:09:40.545
- I think we need to talk.

00:09:40.645 --> 00:09:43.751
- [Nana K.] There's gotta
be some sort of mistake.

00:09:44.285 --> 00:09:46.223
- I'm sorry.

00:09:46.323 --> 00:09:49.262
- [Nana K.] Shoji wouldn't do
this to me.

00:09:49.362 --> 00:09:54.305
(dramatic poignant music
continues)

00:10:01.019 --> 00:10:02.188
(cigarette tapping)

00:10:02.288 --> 00:10:06.363
(dramatic whooshing music)

00:10:09.169 --> 00:10:10.572
- No, don't!

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:21.293
- [Shoji] Sachiko, it's okay,
stay back.

00:10:21.393 --> 00:10:22.361
- [Sachiko] Don't hurt him!

00:10:22.461 --> 00:10:25.034
- [Nana O.] Shut up, he
deserves to get his ass kicked.

00:10:25.134 --> 00:10:25.602
- [Sachiko] No, stop it.

00:10:25.702 --> 00:10:27.539
- This has got nothing to do
with you.

00:10:27.639 --> 00:10:29.409
- It has nothing to do with you!

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:30.444
- [Nana O.] She's got a point.

00:10:30.545 --> 00:10:31.681
- If you wanna hit someone,

00:10:31.781 --> 00:10:33.350
you should be hitting me.
- Hey, come on.

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:35.020
- It's all my fault.

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:35.755
I went and fell in love with him

00:10:35.856 --> 00:10:38.160
even though I knew he had a
girlfriend.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:39.663
But I just couldn't stop myself.

00:10:39.763 --> 00:10:43.036
I won't hide it anymore,
so go ahead and hit me.

00:10:43.136 --> 00:10:47.345
(Sachiko breathing nervously)

00:10:54.058 --> 00:10:55.261
(Nana O. chuckling)

00:10:55.361 --> 00:10:56.831
- You've got some nerve.

00:10:56.931 --> 00:10:58.367
- Please, just stop.

00:10:58.467 --> 00:11:01.674
- Hachi! Why are you just
standing there?

00:11:01.774 --> 00:11:05.047
He's your boyfriend,
you gotta do something.

00:11:05.147 --> 00:11:06.149
(Nana K. whimpering softly)

00:11:06.249 --> 00:11:08.487
If you don't, you're gonna lose
him.

00:11:08.588 --> 00:11:11.761
He's your boyfriend!
Fight for 'im.

00:11:17.305 --> 00:11:19.543
(dramatic music)

00:11:19.643 --> 00:11:21.714
- I don't want him.

00:11:31.132 --> 00:11:33.605
I never wanna see him again.

00:11:51.941 --> 00:11:55.314
I wasn't capable of
forgiving that betrayal.

00:11:55.414 --> 00:11:56.016
I had too much pride

00:11:56.116 --> 00:11:59.422
to fight for someone who hurt me
so badly.

00:12:00.324 --> 00:12:02.529
So of course I lost him.

00:12:30.752 --> 00:12:34.627
(birds chirping faintly)

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.899
(soft music)

00:13:04.753 --> 00:13:07.425
The next day I couldn't
get out of bed.

00:13:07.526 --> 00:13:10.431
It was like I had the
flu or something.

00:13:10.532 --> 00:13:12.068
I just lay there.

00:13:14.205 --> 00:13:17.111
I knew I needed something to
distract me.

00:13:17.211 --> 00:13:21.486
I tried not to think about it,
but nothing seemed to help.

00:13:21.587 --> 00:13:24.459
I just didn't have the energy.

00:13:42.361 --> 00:13:45.668
(Nana K. gasping)

00:13:48.106 --> 00:13:51.747
I couldn't stop dreaming
about Shoji.

00:13:53.718 --> 00:13:57.659
(doorbell ringing)

00:13:59.596 --> 00:14:03.571
(doorbell ringing)

00:14:08.948 --> 00:14:09.917
Coming.

00:14:11.687 --> 00:14:14.258
Hello, how can I help you?

00:14:16.797 --> 00:14:19.570
♪ To cry ♪

00:14:22.341 --> 00:14:24.913
(Nana K. gasping)

00:14:25.013 --> 00:14:26.316
Was that Ren?

00:14:27.619 --> 00:14:30.959
Oh my God. It was just a dream.

00:14:31.059 --> 00:14:34.967
My heart's been broken, so now
I'm dreaming of rock stars?

00:14:36.604 --> 00:14:37.939
But why Ren?

00:14:39.375 --> 00:14:40.645
Huh?

00:14:43.016 --> 00:14:44.953
I guess it was 'cause of this.

00:14:45.053 --> 00:14:47.592
Why wasn't I dreaming
about Takumi?

00:14:47.692 --> 00:14:48.928
(doorbell ringing)

00:14:49.028 --> 00:14:50.364
Someone really is at the door.

00:14:50.464 --> 00:14:54.272
Maybe it's Takumi, or Naoki,
or it could even be Reira.

00:14:55.542 --> 00:14:57.044
Alright, I'm coming!

00:15:00.017 --> 00:15:01.219
Huh?

00:15:01.319 --> 00:15:04.593
- Nana, thank God
you're alive. Oh.

00:15:06.831 --> 00:15:08.968
- Oh, it's only you Jun.

00:15:09.068 --> 00:15:12.609
- Seriously. I was ringing
that doorbell for so long.

00:15:12.709 --> 00:15:13.276
Why didn't you answer?

00:15:13.376 --> 00:15:15.214
I was scared you'd slit
your wrist or something.

00:15:15.314 --> 00:15:16.316
I was freaking out.

00:15:16.416 --> 00:15:18.120
- Slit my wrists?

00:15:19.288 --> 00:15:19.756
- I guess you're here

00:15:19.857 --> 00:15:22.762
'cause you heard about
what happened last night?

00:15:22.863 --> 00:15:24.900
I didn't think about
slitting my wrists.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.772
Might be better than
jumping in the river.

00:15:27.873 --> 00:15:29.275
(dog barking faintly)

00:15:29.375 --> 00:15:30.110
Nana must have called you

00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:32.248
and asked if you'd
check in on me today.

00:15:32.348 --> 00:15:32.916
- [Junko] Huh?

00:15:33.016 --> 00:15:33.851
- Well, she had to go to work

00:15:33.951 --> 00:15:35.822
and she was probably worried
about leaving me here

00:15:35.922 --> 00:15:36.791
on my own all day.

00:15:36.891 --> 00:15:40.130
- To be honest, I don't think
Nana's that considerate.

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:40.832
- Huh?

00:15:40.932 --> 00:15:45.107
- It was Shoji who told
me. He called me earlier.

00:15:49.148 --> 00:15:52.656
He said he was worried about
you.

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:56.530
- Oh, he's worried.

00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:57.833
(Junko sighing)

00:15:57.933 --> 00:16:01.740
If he can't tell me himself,
let him worry all he wants.

00:16:02.742 --> 00:16:06.049
(Nana K. sobbing)

00:16:12.294 --> 00:16:16.035
- You're right. It was stupid
of me to tell you that.

00:16:17.338 --> 00:16:21.514
But you know, I think Shoji's
having a hard time too.

00:16:21.614 --> 00:16:22.782
You know how he is.

00:16:22.883 --> 00:16:24.887
- What? Don't tell me
you're taking his side!

00:16:24.987 --> 00:16:26.891
- No, of course not.
I'm just saying-

00:16:26.991 --> 00:16:29.295
- Who knows how long
he was cheating on me.

00:16:29.395 --> 00:16:30.297
- It can't have been that long,

00:16:30.397 --> 00:16:32.167
and also try not to
think of it like that.

00:16:32.268 --> 00:16:34.573
- Why are you sticking
up for him?

00:16:34.673 --> 00:16:37.946
(Nana K. sobbing)

00:16:49.903 --> 00:16:52.576
(Junko slurping)

00:16:52.676 --> 00:16:53.811
- Maybe you're right.

00:16:53.911 --> 00:16:55.013
It's hard for me,

00:16:55.113 --> 00:16:57.552
Shoji is a really good
friend, and so are you.

00:16:57.652 --> 00:16:59.623
I feel like I'm stuck
in the middle.

00:16:59.723 --> 00:17:03.063
I'm not always gonna be
able to take your side.

00:17:03.163 --> 00:17:06.770
Oh, I don't want you to always
be the one who's the victim.

00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:09.175
I'll admit that Shoji should
have broken up with you

00:17:09.275 --> 00:17:12.849
before starting something
new with someone else.

00:17:14.686 --> 00:17:15.989
But before that even happened,

00:17:16.089 --> 00:17:19.295
you gotta admit there were
problems between you two.

00:17:22.969 --> 00:17:24.806
- Nana K.] Yeah, I know.

00:17:28.013 --> 00:17:31.787
But I tried so hard, Jun.
I really did.

00:17:31.887 --> 00:17:35.127
I even got a job so I could
be totally independent.

00:17:35.227 --> 00:17:36.964
- But Nana, that was something
you did

00:17:37.064 --> 00:17:38.935
because you wanted to, right?

00:17:39.035 --> 00:17:43.844
As usual, I think you were
only thinking about yourself.

00:17:43.945 --> 00:17:47.519
Shoji felt a little left
out of the equation.

00:17:47.619 --> 00:17:51.760
Relationships are about
being there for each other.

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:54.165
Unless you put equal time,
effort,

00:17:54.265 --> 00:17:59.308
and consideration into it,
there's no way it can work.

00:17:59.408 --> 00:18:02.816
(soft somber music)

00:18:17.512 --> 00:18:19.015
- Hachi, I'm home.

00:18:25.895 --> 00:18:27.766
(light clicking)

00:18:27.866 --> 00:18:28.366
- Huh?

00:18:28.466 --> 00:18:29.836
- What are you doing sitting in
the dark?

00:18:29.936 --> 00:18:32.007
It's only gonna make you
more depressed, you know

00:18:32.107 --> 00:18:33.711
- Nana, you're home already?

00:18:33.811 --> 00:18:35.581
No way. It can't be that late.

00:18:35.682 --> 00:18:37.318
You must be hungry, right?

00:18:37.418 --> 00:18:37.986
I'm sorry,

00:18:38.086 --> 00:18:39.990
I didn't get around to
making anything for dinner.

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:43.096
- I figured. So I got us some
takeout.

00:18:43.597 --> 00:18:44.966
Let's eat.

00:18:45.702 --> 00:18:46.637
(Nana K. whimpering)

00:18:46.737 --> 00:18:48.239
No need to cry. It's just food.

00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:50.243
- I've always thought you
were pretty self-centered,

00:18:50.344 --> 00:18:52.816
but deep down you're really
considerate and caring.

00:18:52.916 --> 00:18:54.619
- Considerate and caring?

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:55.487
And hey, self-centered?

00:18:55.588 --> 00:18:57.391
- But look at me, only
ever thinking of myself.

00:18:57.491 --> 00:18:58.961
I didn't even think about you
coming home

00:18:59.061 --> 00:19:00.932
from a hard day's work
with an empty stomach.

00:19:01.032 --> 00:19:03.436
- You don't have to do
that sort of thing for me.

00:19:03.537 --> 00:19:05.407
- Friendships are about
being there for each other.

00:19:05.508 --> 00:19:07.712
- Well, yeah, that's pretty
obvious.

00:19:07.812 --> 00:19:09.048
- At least let me make some tea.

00:19:09.148 --> 00:19:12.454
- By the way, a letter
arrive for you from Natsuko.

00:19:13.591 --> 00:19:14.593
- Really, from my mom?

00:19:14.693 --> 00:19:17.464
- She must have like a
sixth sense or something.

00:19:17.565 --> 00:19:20.370
When you're in a bind, she
always seems to come through.

00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:23.009
That's what mothers are for, I
guess.

00:19:28.821 --> 00:19:31.727
(paper rustling)

00:19:31.827 --> 00:19:33.698
- I wonder what it is.

00:19:33.798 --> 00:19:35.133
If she's asking me to come home,

00:19:35.233 --> 00:19:37.271
I'd probably do it in a second.

00:19:42.081 --> 00:19:43.551
That's all she says?

00:19:43.651 --> 00:19:46.623
No motherly advice? No comfort?

00:19:46.724 --> 00:19:47.692
(Nana K. gasping)

00:19:47.792 --> 00:19:49.261
(Nana K. screaming)

00:19:49.361 --> 00:19:50.698
- Hachi, what's wrong, are you
okay?

00:19:50.798 --> 00:19:53.002
- Oh my God. I need scissors.

00:19:53.103 --> 00:19:55.373
Where are they? A razor blade
will do it.

00:19:55.474 --> 00:19:56.744
- A razor blade?

00:19:56.844 --> 00:19:59.148
Don't do it. Shoji isn't worth
it.

00:19:59.248 --> 00:20:00.183
Of course he isn't, I know that.

00:20:00.283 --> 00:20:02.121
These are the tickets for the
concert.

00:20:02.221 --> 00:20:03.022
- [Nana O.] What?

00:20:03.123 --> 00:20:05.460
- The tickets for the Trapnest
concert.

00:20:07.231 --> 00:20:10.337
I already ordered tickets.
Do you wanna go with me?

00:20:16.482 --> 00:20:18.052
Nana?

00:20:18.153 --> 00:20:19.556
Even though it's painful
sometimes,

00:20:19.656 --> 00:20:22.996
if you keep on living,
good things can happen.

00:20:23.096 --> 00:20:26.469
(soft chill music)

00:20:30.043 --> 00:20:32.381
They're front row seats.

00:20:46.142 --> 00:20:50.250
When I think about it, I
never had much luck back then.

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:53.389
It was as if luck was
avoiding me every day,

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:56.295
especially when it came
to things like this.

00:21:03.611 --> 00:21:06.850
Those tickets were a gift from
the gods,

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:09.088
especially for you, Nana.
