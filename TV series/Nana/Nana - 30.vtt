WEBVTT

00:00:04.776 --> 00:00:08.183
(serene harp music)

00:00:16.668 --> 00:00:18.404
- [Hachiko] We kissed and we
held hands

00:00:18.505 --> 00:00:20.710
all the way to the store,

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.281
but we didn't say a word.

00:00:27.924 --> 00:00:31.330
(upbeat rock music)

00:02:18.244 --> 00:02:20.783
His hand is really warm.

00:02:20.883 --> 00:02:23.154
Just like Nana's.

00:02:23.254 --> 00:02:25.559
I never wanna let go of this
hand,

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:26.895
ever.

00:02:33.074 --> 00:02:36.380
How can I make him
understand the way I feel?

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.219
(somber piano music)

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:40.589
I didn't turn away Takumi,

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:43.327
even though I was hanging out
with Nobuo.

00:02:43.428 --> 00:02:46.968
Now, no matter what I
say, how can he trust me?

00:02:50.442 --> 00:02:52.012
But the truth is

00:02:52.112 --> 00:02:54.016
I've been holding back the whole
time.

00:02:54.116 --> 00:02:57.155
I wanted to be Nobuo's
girlfriend,

00:02:57.255 --> 00:02:59.293
I wanted to be close to him.

00:03:02.466 --> 00:03:05.639
I was secretly hoping
for the day he'd hold me

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.879
every time we walked along
this path by the river.

00:03:15.024 --> 00:03:17.295
So what does this all mean?

00:03:17.395 --> 00:03:18.532
What are you thinking?

00:03:18.632 --> 00:03:21.303
I'm too afraid to ask.

00:03:21.403 --> 00:03:25.546
You can take me away
right now if you want to.

00:03:27.282 --> 00:03:30.488
But what do I do if he thinks
I'm just some stupid girl

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:33.729
who falls for guys even
though she has a boyfriend?

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:36.467
He'll end up seriously hating
me.

00:03:41.778 --> 00:03:44.551
(Nana gulping)

00:03:44.651 --> 00:03:48.592
- What's with all this
pointless talk, baldy?

00:03:49.226 --> 00:03:50.328
(Shinichi chuckles)

00:03:50.428 --> 00:03:52.165
We just have to sell records,
right?

00:03:52.265 --> 00:03:52.800
How hard can that be?

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.706
Just tell Kawano to hurry up
and work out our contract.

00:03:55.806 --> 00:03:58.044
It's pretty straightforward.

00:03:58.144 --> 00:03:59.981
Okay? You got that?

00:04:00.081 --> 00:04:00.583
- Okay.

00:04:00.683 --> 00:04:02.687
- God, I'm so tired of this.

00:04:02.787 --> 00:04:04.056
My hair is gonna fall out.

00:04:04.156 --> 00:04:06.093
I'm gonna take a bath and go to
bed.

00:04:06.193 --> 00:04:10.870
- Huh? Aren't you gonna stay
up 'til Hachiko gets back?

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.072
- She's not coming back,

00:04:12.172 --> 00:04:13.809
which means I lose the bet.

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:14.209
- Huh?

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:17.249
- [Nana] I bet a hundred
he's done before he starts.

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:19.654
- But doesn't she have a
boyfriend?

00:04:19.754 --> 00:04:21.357
- Well, if I can't crash at
Nobuo's

00:04:21.457 --> 00:04:22.492
then I guess I'll be a good boy

00:04:22.593 --> 00:04:24.898
and go to my parents tonight.

00:04:24.998 --> 00:04:25.866
- Your parents?

00:04:25.966 --> 00:04:30.241
- Oh, hello, Ryoko, I bet
you had a long day today.

00:04:30.341 --> 00:04:32.445
Sorry I'm calling so late.

00:04:33.181 --> 00:04:34.349
Uh-hmm.

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:37.088
I'm fine, I'm coming over right
now.

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:40.563
See you later, Misato, take
care.

00:04:40.663 --> 00:04:42.299
- What? You're leaving.

00:04:42.399 --> 00:04:43.267
Seriously?

00:04:43.367 --> 00:04:44.303
- Shin, wait.

00:04:44.403 --> 00:04:45.438
- Huh?

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:47.175
- Tell me something, who's
Ryoko?

00:04:47.275 --> 00:04:49.112
- She's the woman who raised me.

00:04:49.213 --> 00:04:49.714
- Don't lie.

00:04:49.814 --> 00:04:52.319
I know that you weren't raised
by a woman.

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:54.056
- Huh?

00:04:54.156 --> 00:04:55.058
How do you know that?

00:04:55.158 --> 00:04:57.797
- If you don't want people
finding out who you are

00:04:57.897 --> 00:05:00.368
you should at least be smart
enough to use an alias.

00:05:00.468 --> 00:05:02.072
(Shinichi sighs heavily)

00:05:02.172 --> 00:05:05.679
- Fine, I'm not gonna give
anyone my full name ever again.

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:07.917
Not that I care if they find
anything out.

00:05:08.017 --> 00:05:10.522
It's just that I don't
like people snooping around

00:05:10.623 --> 00:05:11.658
in my personal life.

00:05:11.758 --> 00:05:13.996
- Then maybe you should
stop doing stupid things

00:05:14.096 --> 00:05:14.664
that freak everyone out.

00:05:14.764 --> 00:05:17.035
You can put up a front all you
want

00:05:17.135 --> 00:05:18.505
but you're still a kid.

00:05:18.605 --> 00:05:20.542
We need to get your legal
guardian's signature

00:05:20.643 --> 00:05:22.379
on the record contract.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.349
- Oh.

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:29.092
- So if you don't want to see
him, I can get his signature.

00:05:30.395 --> 00:05:31.631
- Hmm!

00:05:33.234 --> 00:05:35.471
Do what you have to do, Yasu.

00:05:42.653 --> 00:05:45.258
- Hey, Misato, I'm
gonna go home too.

00:05:45.358 --> 00:05:46.260
- Huh?

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.761
- Sorry,

00:05:46.861 --> 00:05:48.397
but I've got a lot of work to
do.

00:05:48.497 --> 00:05:49.968
- Oh, that's fine

00:05:50.068 --> 00:05:50.703
I really don't mind.

00:05:50.803 --> 00:05:53.842
But does that mean you are
admitting you lost the bet?

00:05:53.942 --> 00:05:56.180
Miss Hachiko already has a
boyfriend,

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.617
so are you all right with tha...

00:05:57.717 --> 00:05:59.052
I mean, is Nobuo all right with
that?

00:05:59.152 --> 00:06:02.325
- Eh, well, guys can become
pushovers

00:06:02.425 --> 00:06:03.327
around the girls they love.

00:06:03.427 --> 00:06:06.568
And I don't even pretend to
understand the complexities

00:06:06.668 --> 00:06:08.137
of the female species.

00:06:08.237 --> 00:06:08.639
- I get it,

00:06:08.739 --> 00:06:10.976
it's sort of a complicated
situation.

00:06:11.076 --> 00:06:11.645
I'm sorry.

00:06:11.745 --> 00:06:14.951
I really should just stay
out of it.

00:06:15.051 --> 00:06:16.086
- Huh!

00:06:18.825 --> 00:06:21.130
So you're gonna be staying
here the whole summer?

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.735
Your parents don't mind that
you're away?

00:06:23.835 --> 00:06:25.706
- No, no. You don't
need to worry about me.

00:06:25.806 --> 00:06:28.845
- Do you mind if I ask
you a question?

00:06:28.945 --> 00:06:29.981
- Um, okay.

00:06:30.081 --> 00:06:33.087
- Misato Uehara, what
is your real name?

00:06:33.187 --> 00:06:33.689
(Misato gasps)

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:36.193
(Misato chuckles)

00:06:36.293 --> 00:06:38.230
- It's top secret.

00:06:40.703 --> 00:06:41.771
(calm piano music)

00:06:41.871 --> 00:06:43.742
- So she really does use a fake
name.

00:06:43.842 --> 00:06:46.681
And she seems like
such a good girl.

00:06:46.781 --> 00:06:49.419
I'll never understand women.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.624
Man oh man.

00:06:53.227 --> 00:06:56.266
(phone rings)

00:06:56.367 --> 00:06:57.870
- Hmm!

00:06:57.970 --> 00:06:59.006
Hachi?

00:07:03.715 --> 00:07:05.118
Oh, here she is.

00:07:08.825 --> 00:07:09.927
Huh?

00:07:13.702 --> 00:07:15.639
Oh, there's gonna be fireworks,

00:07:15.739 --> 00:07:16.574
and it's nearby.

00:07:16.675 --> 00:07:19.212
Huh! Wanna go together?

00:07:19.312 --> 00:07:22.687
(Hachiko whimpers)

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:25.526
- I'll carry one.

00:07:25.626 --> 00:07:26.861
- It's cool.

00:07:30.368 --> 00:07:33.340
(Hachiko sighs)

00:07:33.441 --> 00:07:34.544
- Oh!

00:07:34.644 --> 00:07:36.146
Actually you can.

00:07:36.246 --> 00:07:39.620
(Hachiko chuckles)

00:07:47.636 --> 00:07:48.437
- How did you know?

00:07:48.538 --> 00:07:50.274
- Huh? Know what?

00:07:50.375 --> 00:07:51.711
- Exactly what I was thinking.

00:07:51.811 --> 00:07:53.648
- Well, I didn't really know.

00:07:53.749 --> 00:07:55.351
- We must be in sync with each
other.

00:07:55.451 --> 00:07:56.153
- Do you really think so?

00:07:56.253 --> 00:07:58.124
'Cause I have to admit
I'm a bit lost here.

00:07:58.224 --> 00:08:00.261
So maybe you could tell
me what's going on.

00:08:00.361 --> 00:08:01.230
- Is it telepathy?

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:02.700
- Listen to what I'm saying.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:04.504
- Huh? I'm sorry.

00:08:04.604 --> 00:08:06.941
I have a tendency to get
carried away.

00:08:07.041 --> 00:08:07.576
- Oh no,

00:08:07.676 --> 00:08:08.477
to tell you the truth

00:08:08.578 --> 00:08:09.614
I really like how you sometimes

00:08:09.714 --> 00:08:11.350
have this wild imagination.

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:12.252
- You're disappointed.

00:08:12.352 --> 00:08:14.222
It's my fault.

00:08:14.322 --> 00:08:14.891
- Wait a minute,

00:08:14.991 --> 00:08:16.160
is this push pull game of yours

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.832
some sort of method to
make guys fall for you?

00:08:18.932 --> 00:08:19.199
- What?

00:08:19.299 --> 00:08:21.136
- You're such a natural
and it works so well.

00:08:21.236 --> 00:08:23.074
- I'm not.
- What a terrible woman.

00:08:23.174 --> 00:08:24.844
You're an agent of the Demon
Lord,

00:08:24.944 --> 00:08:26.246
that's why you always
talk about him.

00:08:26.346 --> 00:08:26.848
- I'm not.

00:08:26.948 --> 00:08:29.419
- But you're the one who
said you are a horrible girl.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:32.292
(Nobuo gasps)

00:08:33.461 --> 00:08:34.329
I was joking.

00:08:34.429 --> 00:08:34.931
- I'm sorry.

00:08:35.031 --> 00:08:37.202
I promise I'll break it
off with Takumi.

00:08:37.302 --> 00:08:39.072
(Nobuo gasps)

00:08:39.172 --> 00:08:40.208
(Nobuo sighs)

00:08:40.308 --> 00:08:41.511
It's just that...

00:08:41.611 --> 00:08:44.349
I... I really didn't
want anyone to know

00:08:44.449 --> 00:08:45.218
about me and Takumi.

00:08:45.318 --> 00:08:48.124
I was pretending that
it didn't really happen.

00:08:48.224 --> 00:08:52.265
And then I could be
your girlfriend.

00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:56.808
I guess in the end I just
screwed up everything.

00:08:57.877 --> 00:08:59.246
Do you hate me now?

00:09:00.214 --> 00:09:01.283
- Huh?

00:09:01.383 --> 00:09:03.822
No, I never could.

00:09:07.095 --> 00:09:09.266
Stop staring at me with
those big teary eyes,

00:09:09.366 --> 00:09:12.071
I can't help but say
whatever you want.

00:09:13.975 --> 00:09:17.817
The thing is, I can't
take you away from him

00:09:17.917 --> 00:09:19.019
and I don't own you.

00:09:19.119 --> 00:09:22.125
And I don't wanna make
you sneak around either.

00:09:25.699 --> 00:09:27.803
If we let things get outta
control now

00:09:27.903 --> 00:09:29.439
you're just gonna end up
feeling trapped

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:30.676
between me and Takumi.

00:09:30.776 --> 00:09:32.813
And you'll tear yourself apart

00:09:32.913 --> 00:09:35.184
'cause you care about people.

00:09:35.284 --> 00:09:37.890
But I don't think you
screwed things up.

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:42.933
You really shouldn't
be so hard on yourself.

00:09:43.033 --> 00:09:46.406
I'm sure you can't help it that
you're attracted to Takumi.

00:09:47.475 --> 00:09:48.879
And no matter how hard I try,

00:09:48.979 --> 00:09:50.481
I just can't compete with him.

00:09:50.582 --> 00:09:52.520
- That's not true, really.

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:53.588
- [Nobuo] But even so,

00:09:53.688 --> 00:09:54.957
if you tell me

00:09:55.057 --> 00:09:59.099
that you'll break up with
him and go out with me...

00:09:59.199 --> 00:10:01.638
I'll do whatever it
takes to make you happy.

00:10:01.738 --> 00:10:06.480
(Hachiko gasps)
(somber music)

00:10:06.581 --> 00:10:07.883
For the sake of your happiness,

00:10:07.983 --> 00:10:10.054
I will do everything
within my power.

00:10:10.154 --> 00:10:11.925
I promise.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:14.429
- Am I dreaming?

00:10:17.101 --> 00:10:22.312
- I mean, I feel like I can do
anything with you by my side.

00:10:22.412 --> 00:10:26.220
- But in this dream I
don't have to wake up.

00:10:28.892 --> 00:10:30.461
- So once you've broken
up with Takumi

00:10:30.562 --> 00:10:34.937
and sorted out your
feelings, then come to me.

00:10:35.739 --> 00:10:38.010
I'll be waiting for you.

00:10:42.786 --> 00:10:47.963
- Hey Nana, I've fallen
in love so many times.

00:10:48.063 --> 00:10:49.834
But until that day,

00:10:49.934 --> 00:10:52.539
I didn't think a guy
existed in real life

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:56.413
who would seriously talk
to me like that.

00:10:56.514 --> 00:10:59.452
Is this the way Ren
talks to you, Nana?

00:11:00.522 --> 00:11:02.325
I really wanna talk to you.

00:11:11.911 --> 00:11:14.584
- Huh? Welcome back,
Ms. Hachiko.

00:11:14.684 --> 00:11:16.521
- Sorry for getting
back so late.

00:11:16.621 --> 00:11:17.656
- It's okay.

00:11:17.756 --> 00:11:20.027
That didn't take long.

00:11:20.629 --> 00:11:21.864
So you're alone?

00:11:21.965 --> 00:11:23.100
- Hey, where is Shin and Yasu?

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.436
- Oh, they already took off.

00:11:24.537 --> 00:11:28.344
- Huh? But I went to the store
to buy them all this stuff.

00:11:28.945 --> 00:11:29.880
- Oh, sorry.

00:11:29.981 --> 00:11:32.018
Anyway, we can just use
it for another party.

00:11:32.118 --> 00:11:34.222
What happened to Nobuo?

00:11:34.957 --> 00:11:35.926
- He walked me here,

00:11:36.026 --> 00:11:37.796
but he said he has to work
in the morning,

00:11:37.896 --> 00:11:38.865
so he went his place.

00:11:38.965 --> 00:11:40.502
- Oh, really?

00:11:40.602 --> 00:11:42.405
So something did happen.

00:11:42.506 --> 00:11:44.877
- Well, I guess we can call
it a night,

00:11:44.977 --> 00:11:46.146
I've gotta work in the morning
too.

00:11:46.246 --> 00:11:48.417
So, mind if I jump in the
tub first?

00:11:48.518 --> 00:11:49.887
- Oh wait, Nana's in there!

00:11:49.987 --> 00:11:53.762
(Hachiko gasps)

00:11:53.862 --> 00:11:55.699
- I knew you'd just barge in
here.

00:11:55.799 --> 00:11:58.805
Some people would think
you're a real perv.

00:11:59.372 --> 00:12:00.374
- Nana.

00:12:02.312 --> 00:12:03.615
- Hmm?

00:12:03.715 --> 00:12:04.750
(Nana gasps)

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:06.153
You can't just jump in here,

00:12:06.253 --> 00:12:07.756
what the hell are you thinking
anyway?

00:12:07.856 --> 00:12:09.927
- But it's cool 'cause we're
both girls.

00:12:10.027 --> 00:12:11.964
- Look, I don't take
baths with other chicks.

00:12:12.065 --> 00:12:13.535
- So you take baths with guys?

00:12:13.635 --> 00:12:14.336
- Yeah, why not?

00:12:14.436 --> 00:12:15.037
- That's just weird.

00:12:15.137 --> 00:12:17.676
- Not as weird as taking
a bath with a female dog

00:12:17.776 --> 00:12:19.179
that just returned home from
a walk.

00:12:19.279 --> 00:12:19.714
- Wait, Nana!

00:12:19.814 --> 00:12:21.517
I have to tell you
about me and Nobuo.

00:12:21.617 --> 00:12:22.853
- Hmm?

00:12:26.059 --> 00:12:28.798
So what's up with Nobuo?

00:12:35.478 --> 00:12:36.581
- Well...

00:12:41.591 --> 00:12:44.396
He asked me to go see
the fireworks with him.

00:12:44.496 --> 00:12:45.532
- Huh?

00:12:47.936 --> 00:12:48.370
Then go.

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:51.376
Does that school boy
even have a...

00:12:51.476 --> 00:12:52.880
He's useless.

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:54.082
- So Yasu won the bet.

00:12:54.182 --> 00:12:55.117
No wonder he's in charge.

00:12:55.217 --> 00:12:59.259
It's like he knows everything
about everyone in the band.

00:13:00.662 --> 00:13:01.964
I'll have a real talk with Nana

00:13:02.065 --> 00:13:04.369
after I end things with Takumi.

00:13:04.469 --> 00:13:05.772
I owe it to her.

00:13:05.872 --> 00:13:07.241
She's the one who helped me meet
him,

00:13:07.341 --> 00:13:09.446
and she supported me
after we got together.

00:13:09.547 --> 00:13:13.722
I'm sure she'll be
like, "What the hell?"

00:13:13.822 --> 00:13:17.028
If I were in Nana's shoes,
that's what I would be thinking.

00:13:17.128 --> 00:13:21.504
I mean really, who
wouldn't think that way?

00:13:40.374 --> 00:13:43.213
I'll say goodbye to him over the
phone.

00:13:44.382 --> 00:13:47.756
I don't wanna see his
face when he gets hurt.

00:13:47.856 --> 00:13:50.094
He's so full of pride.

00:13:55.171 --> 00:13:56.841
- Lately there's been some
mosquitoes

00:13:56.941 --> 00:13:58.611
buzzing around outside
my apartment.

00:13:58.711 --> 00:13:59.713
It's so annoying.

00:13:59.814 --> 00:14:00.749
- Huh? You're place too?

00:14:00.849 --> 00:14:03.187
Oh man! I thought it
was just me.

00:14:03.287 --> 00:14:05.124
For once I felt like the
star of the band.

00:14:05.224 --> 00:14:06.126
- It's not a good thing.

00:14:06.226 --> 00:14:08.297
- Mosquitoes? Well, it is
summer.

00:14:08.397 --> 00:14:10.134
- Reira, please tell me you're
kidding.

00:14:10.234 --> 00:14:12.338
- The paparazzi have
been coming by my place too.

00:14:12.438 --> 00:14:15.244
I wonder whose blood
they really wanna suck.

00:14:15.344 --> 00:14:16.981
- They must be around my
place too.

00:14:17.081 --> 00:14:18.183
This is bad.

00:14:18.283 --> 00:14:19.587
- It's your blood they want.

00:14:19.687 --> 00:14:20.221
- Oh yeah,

00:14:20.321 --> 00:14:22.759
you've got a girlfriend staying
at your place, don't you?

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:23.595
- Send her home

00:14:23.695 --> 00:14:25.131
before any of them find out,

00:14:25.231 --> 00:14:27.201
we can't afford any
scandals with you in it.

00:14:27.301 --> 00:14:28.303
- Oh, it isn't that bad.

00:14:28.403 --> 00:14:30.742
Ren Honjo, madly in love.

00:14:30.842 --> 00:14:32.546
That's not disgraceful.

00:14:32.646 --> 00:14:34.048
In fact, I think it's adorable.

00:14:34.149 --> 00:14:35.852
- I'll tell her she has to
dress hot

00:14:35.952 --> 00:14:38.056
whenever she goes out
from now on.

00:14:38.157 --> 00:14:39.593
- When will we be done here?

00:14:39.693 --> 00:14:40.896
I wanna return home

00:14:40.996 --> 00:14:42.098
to my annoying mosquitoes.

00:14:42.198 --> 00:14:43.167
- Then just leave.

00:14:43.267 --> 00:14:43.701
I've already told you

00:14:43.802 --> 00:14:47.141
that the band does just fine
with or without you, dude.

00:14:47.241 --> 00:14:48.511
(Atsushi grunts)
(phone rings)

00:14:48.611 --> 00:14:49.647
- Huh?

00:14:51.283 --> 00:14:52.351
Hmm!

00:14:55.759 --> 00:14:57.930
(phone ringing)

00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:59.265
- Huh?

00:15:05.745 --> 00:15:10.054
He didn't have to get
back to me that fast.

00:15:11.891 --> 00:15:12.492
Hello.

00:15:12.593 --> 00:15:14.496
- [Takumi] What did you
want to talk to me about?

00:15:14.597 --> 00:15:17.435
(somber music)

00:15:19.005 --> 00:15:21.777
Come on, what's the matter?

00:15:21.878 --> 00:15:23.113
- I can't do it like this.

00:15:23.213 --> 00:15:25.184
Breaking up with someone over
the phone.

00:15:25.284 --> 00:15:28.323
That's pretty cold.

00:15:28.423 --> 00:15:30.494
Um, can we get together to talk?

00:15:30.595 --> 00:15:34.035
- [Takumi] Sorry, we're
doing a TV show right now.

00:15:34.135 --> 00:15:36.707
- Oh, sorry to bug
you like this.

00:15:36.807 --> 00:15:37.809
- That's okay.

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:39.580
We spend more time
sitting around

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:40.181
than we do shooting.

00:15:40.281 --> 00:15:41.349
It's such a drag.

00:15:41.449 --> 00:15:43.086
- You hardly ever go on TV.

00:15:43.187 --> 00:15:44.657
- [Takumi] That'll be on
satellite,

00:15:44.757 --> 00:15:46.026
they're doing a special on us.

00:15:46.126 --> 00:15:47.228
- Oh, that's too bad

00:15:47.328 --> 00:15:48.665
'cause we don't have satellite
TV.

00:15:48.765 --> 00:15:50.669
- [Takumi] If you're
a fan, you should get it.

00:15:50.769 --> 00:15:52.205
- This is no good.

00:15:52.305 --> 00:15:54.342
Don't get sucked back in.

00:15:57.481 --> 00:15:57.683
- What's wrong?

00:15:57.783 --> 00:16:00.589
You don't wanna talk
about it on the phone?

00:16:00.689 --> 00:16:01.456
Unfortunately,

00:16:01.557 --> 00:16:03.795
my schedule's gonna be
crazy busy for a while.

00:16:03.895 --> 00:16:06.499
- Oh, right of course.

00:16:06.601 --> 00:16:07.268
- What is it?

00:16:07.368 --> 00:16:08.337
Don't tell me you're pregnant.

00:16:08.437 --> 00:16:10.040
(Hachiko gasps)
- No, that's not it!

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:10.942
(Takumi sighs)

00:16:11.042 --> 00:16:12.613
- So it's something else.

00:16:12.713 --> 00:16:14.516
Thank God.

00:16:14.617 --> 00:16:15.719
You scared me there.

00:16:15.819 --> 00:16:16.419
I may not look it

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:18.423
but I'm actually one of
those sensitive artist types.

00:16:18.524 --> 00:16:22.098
I don't deal well with
inconveniences like that.

00:16:22.198 --> 00:16:23.166
- I'm sorry.

00:16:23.267 --> 00:16:25.505
Inconvenience.

00:16:25.605 --> 00:16:26.974
(thunder crashing)
Getting a girl pregnant

00:16:27.074 --> 00:16:29.012
is just some
inconvenience for him.

00:16:29.112 --> 00:16:31.116
What's wrong with him?
Is he even human?

00:16:31.216 --> 00:16:34.222
And why do I keep apologizing?

00:16:34.957 --> 00:16:36.326
- Time to go, dude?

00:16:36.426 --> 00:16:37.896
- Yeah.

00:16:37.996 --> 00:16:39.432
Sorry, I gotta go right now

00:16:39.533 --> 00:16:41.871
but I'll call you back when
I have more time to talk.

00:16:41.971 --> 00:16:42.438
- Why bother?

00:16:42.539 --> 00:16:44.643
In fact don't ever call me
again.

00:16:44.743 --> 00:16:45.679
- Ah?

00:16:45.779 --> 00:16:46.814
- So goodbye.

00:16:46.914 --> 00:16:47.950
(Hachiko grunts)

00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:49.452
I did it.

00:16:49.553 --> 00:16:51.289
I told him off.

00:16:53.427 --> 00:16:56.801
(Hachiko whimpers)

00:16:57.936 --> 00:16:59.707
So that's it.

00:16:59.807 --> 00:17:02.879
(phone beeping)

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:03.313
(Takumi scoffs)

00:17:03.413 --> 00:17:05.752
- I think Nana's
pissed off at me.

00:17:05.852 --> 00:17:06.587
- Nana?

00:17:06.687 --> 00:17:08.156
Oh, you mean Hachiko.

00:17:08.256 --> 00:17:09.760
Well, I'd be mad at you too.

00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:11.664
"Don't tell me you're pregnant.

00:17:11.764 --> 00:17:12.899
(sighs) You scared me."

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.503
And you say you're sensitive.

00:17:14.603 --> 00:17:16.841
You don't have an ounce
of sensitivity.

00:17:16.941 --> 00:17:18.176
- But it really would suck.

00:17:18.277 --> 00:17:20.281
I was just trying to be honest.

00:17:20.381 --> 00:17:22.719
It'd actually probably
suck the most for her.

00:17:22.819 --> 00:17:23.888
- If that's how you feel

00:17:23.988 --> 00:17:26.794
you really ought start
wearing condoms.

00:17:26.894 --> 00:17:28.096
- Yeah, right.

00:17:28.196 --> 00:17:29.065
Like you should talk.

00:17:29.165 --> 00:17:30.234
- [Ren] But I'm cool with it.

00:17:30.334 --> 00:17:32.171
In fact, I could go
for the family life,

00:17:32.271 --> 00:17:34.610
but she's back on the
pill again.

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:35.912
What a feminist.

00:17:36.012 --> 00:17:39.252
- And it's all about
what you want.

00:17:46.166 --> 00:17:48.771
- He's not even calling me back.

00:17:48.871 --> 00:17:50.575
How come?

00:17:51.476 --> 00:17:53.982
I guess that was easy.

00:17:54.082 --> 00:17:59.025
Why was I with someone who
didn't really care about me?

00:17:59.125 --> 00:18:02.431
It's a harsh awakening
from my wildest dreams.

00:18:03.233 --> 00:18:06.072
But really I knew from the start

00:18:06.172 --> 00:18:08.076
that Takumi didn't love me.

00:18:08.176 --> 00:18:09.580
(somber music)

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:11.517
There's no way that I
could hurt his feelings.

00:18:11.617 --> 00:18:16.259
I just finally woke up
from a nightmare.

00:18:16.359 --> 00:18:17.395
Every time we got together,

00:18:17.495 --> 00:18:21.737
we'd go to bed and he'd say
things I wanted to hear.

00:18:21.837 --> 00:18:25.477
And it felt really good
to touch someone.

00:18:25.578 --> 00:18:28.651
I guess I was hoping it
would turn into real love.

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:33.594
But that was nothing but an
illusion.

00:18:33.695 --> 00:18:36.534
Finally, I've woken up
to the truth.

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:39.807
- I'll be waiting for you.

00:18:41.877 --> 00:18:43.346
- I'm awake now.

00:18:43.447 --> 00:18:45.885
Because my real prince
kissed me.

00:18:54.536 --> 00:18:56.707
Well, he doesn't look
like a typical prince

00:18:56.807 --> 00:18:59.078
but I guess that's okay.

00:18:59.178 --> 00:19:00.849
- Ah! You scared me!

00:19:00.949 --> 00:19:02.786
- Sorry If it seems like I'm
stalking you.

00:19:02.886 --> 00:19:05.023
It's just that Nana
told me where you work.

00:19:05.124 --> 00:19:07.562
I didn't know that you worked
in a cool record store.

00:19:07.662 --> 00:19:10.602
Wow, no wonder you have so
many records in your room.

00:19:10.702 --> 00:19:13.106
- Oh, well I only work here
twice a week.

00:19:13.206 --> 00:19:15.745
I also do some odd jobs
here and there.

00:19:15.845 --> 00:19:16.379
- Oh, I see.

00:19:16.479 --> 00:19:18.851
By the way, what time
do you get off today?

00:19:18.951 --> 00:19:19.586
- At nine.

00:19:19.686 --> 00:19:21.289
- Cool, then I'll just wait
for you

00:19:21.389 --> 00:19:22.559
at the cafe next door.

00:19:22.659 --> 00:19:23.961
- Huh?

00:19:24.061 --> 00:19:25.130
- Come to think of it.

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:28.738
There are a lot of things I
don't know about Nobuo yet.

00:19:30.642 --> 00:19:33.480
I wanna learn everything
about him.

00:19:33.581 --> 00:19:38.724
I think his blood type is
A, which means he's serious.

00:19:42.933 --> 00:19:45.370
Damn, I can't sit still.

00:19:47.074 --> 00:19:47.909
How was work today?

00:19:48.009 --> 00:19:48.778
(Nobuo screams)

00:19:48.878 --> 00:19:50.615
- Don't sneak up on me
like that.

00:19:50.715 --> 00:19:54.188
(somber orchestral music)

00:19:54.288 --> 00:19:55.892
- Hey, Nobuo, are you hungry?

00:19:55.992 --> 00:19:59.332
I came straight from work so
I haven't eaten anything yet.

00:19:59.432 --> 00:20:01.102
- Oh, then let's go get
a bite to eat.

00:20:01.202 --> 00:20:04.142
- It'd be cheaper if I made
you something at your place.

00:20:04.242 --> 00:20:05.945
- Huh? My place?

00:20:06.045 --> 00:20:06.714
No way.

00:20:06.814 --> 00:20:07.381
- Why not?

00:20:07.481 --> 00:20:08.483
- I told you to come to me

00:20:08.584 --> 00:20:10.789
after you'd work things out with
Takumi.

00:20:10.889 --> 00:20:11.757
- But I did,

00:20:11.857 --> 00:20:12.793
that's why I came.

00:20:12.893 --> 00:20:13.426
- It's too fast!

00:20:13.528 --> 00:20:14.563
- I... I'm sorry.

00:20:14.663 --> 00:20:16.734
So much stuff has happened
between now and then.

00:20:16.834 --> 00:20:19.740
It feels more like a year
is passed than a day.

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:22.444
- Yeah, but it doesn't really
matter what it felt like.

00:20:22.546 --> 00:20:24.315
One day is still one day.

00:20:24.415 --> 00:20:26.219
- Okay then I'll try to wait one
more day.

00:20:26.319 --> 00:20:27.722
Huh?

00:20:27.823 --> 00:20:29.793
- Can you make stew
with beef and potatoes?

00:20:29.893 --> 00:20:30.895
- It's my specialty.

00:20:30.995 --> 00:20:31.964
- She's so cute.

00:20:32.064 --> 00:20:35.304
Oh, let's just pretend
that a year has passed.

00:20:36.239 --> 00:20:37.274
- Where's Hachiko?

00:20:37.374 --> 00:20:38.744
- Oh, she text messaged me

00:20:38.845 --> 00:20:40.347
saying she might not
come home tonight.

00:20:40.447 --> 00:20:42.652
Maybe she's at her
boyfriend's again.

00:20:42.752 --> 00:20:42.986
- What?

00:20:43.086 --> 00:20:46.259
But I thought they were gonna
be filming until midnight.

00:20:46.359 --> 00:20:48.296
(Nana gasps)

00:20:48.396 --> 00:20:52.506
(somber orchestral music)

00:20:52.606 --> 00:20:54.576
- [Hachiko] Hey Nana,

00:20:55.678 --> 00:20:58.784
what does Ren say to you
when you're making love?

00:21:01.489 --> 00:21:03.528
I should've asked you then.

00:21:03.628 --> 00:21:05.430
I should've found out.

00:21:08.504 --> 00:21:12.478
That old clawfoot bathtub
isn't around anymore
