00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:04.643
(birds chirping)

00:00:10.662 --> 00:00:11.463
- From what I can see,

00:00:11.564 --> 00:00:13.801
your garden's ripe for harvest.

00:00:15.437 --> 00:00:17.175
- [Hachiko] It's more than ripe,

00:00:17.275 --> 00:00:19.045
it's overflowing.

00:00:19.947 --> 00:00:23.988
("Rose" by Anna Tsuchiya)

00:01:59.513 --> 00:02:00.882
- I win.

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:05.391
6,000 from each of you.

00:02:05.491 --> 00:02:06.426
- No way!

00:02:06.527 --> 00:02:07.763
Come on, gimme a break.

00:02:07.863 --> 00:02:08.898
- He isn't kidding either,

00:02:08.998 --> 00:02:09.833
he's really done it.

00:02:09.933 --> 00:02:12.606
But we could do with less of the
attitude.

00:02:12.706 --> 00:02:13.240
- Damn him.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.679
If we were playing Sevens, I'd
be winning.

00:02:15.779 --> 00:02:16.580
- What the hell's Sevens?

00:02:16.681 --> 00:02:19.152
- This card game the
band's really gotten into.

00:02:19.252 --> 00:02:21.489
We play every night when we're
on tour.

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:22.325
- It's all Nalaki's fault

00:02:22.425 --> 00:02:23.861
for bringing a pack of cards
along

00:02:23.962 --> 00:02:24.530
in the first place.

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.567
I mean, this is a serious
professional tour,

00:02:26.667 --> 00:02:28.236
not some school field trip.

00:02:28.337 --> 00:02:29.540
(Nobu laughs)

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.441
(knife clatters on tabletop)

00:02:30.542 --> 00:02:31.476
- Sevens, huh?

00:02:31.577 --> 00:02:34.717
And the guys from Trap
Nest play every night?

00:02:34.817 --> 00:02:37.956
(hard rock tune)

00:02:41.998 --> 00:02:44.870
Sounds like Sevens must
be a really cool game!

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.074
And Ren says no one can beat
him!

00:02:47.174 --> 00:02:48.978
- So the Sevens game, is it fun
to play?

00:02:49.078 --> 00:02:50.147
- Seriously, you don't know?

00:02:50.247 --> 00:02:51.416
- What kind of life have you
been living

00:02:51.517 --> 00:02:53.821
if you haven't played
Sevens at least once?

00:02:53.921 --> 00:02:54.823
- Yeah Shin,

00:02:54.923 --> 00:02:56.292
what kind of life have you been
living?

00:02:56.393 --> 00:02:56.994
- I'd like to know too.

00:02:57.094 --> 00:02:59.098
- I think you guys should
teach me how to play.

00:02:59.198 --> 00:03:00.401
I'm bored with Mahjong anyway.

00:03:00.502 --> 00:03:04.008
- No way, man, I'm sick of
playing Sevens.

00:03:04.108 --> 00:03:06.012
- What was it like for
you growing up Shin?

00:03:06.112 --> 00:03:08.316
It seems easy for you to
get along with people.

00:03:08.417 --> 00:03:09.419
You're already talking to these
guys

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.058
like it's no big deal, it's
amazing.

00:03:12.158 --> 00:03:14.663
- Shin, if you're done, I'll
play.

00:03:14.763 --> 00:03:15.999
- Here, take my place.

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:17.334
Where's the bathroom?

00:03:17.435 --> 00:03:19.205
- [Nana] Over there.

00:03:19.305 --> 00:03:21.409
- Takumi goes to the bathroom?

00:03:22.311 --> 00:03:24.983
Oh, duh, of course he does.

00:03:25.084 --> 00:03:26.554
What is wrong with me?

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:28.858
It's just that Ren and Takumi

00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.029
are different from what I
expected.

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:33.367
You hardly ever see Trap Nest on
TV.

00:03:33.467 --> 00:03:35.204
So I kind of had an image in my
mind

00:03:35.304 --> 00:03:36.907
from the CDs and magazines,

00:03:37.007 --> 00:03:39.613
that they'd be much more cool
and aloof,

00:03:40.615 --> 00:03:42.084
especially Takumi.

00:03:42.184 --> 00:03:46.627
In interviews he always
acts serious and in control.

00:03:46.727 --> 00:03:48.096
So I imagined that in person,

00:03:48.196 --> 00:03:50.568
he was gonna be quiet and
mature,

00:03:50.668 --> 00:03:52.004
but he's not really like that.

00:03:52.104 --> 00:03:55.645
He's more of a friendly,
big brother type of guy.

00:03:55.745 --> 00:03:57.281
(knife clattering on tabletop)

00:03:57.381 --> 00:03:58.651
Huh?

00:03:58.751 --> 00:04:02.526
(Takumi munching)

00:04:02.626 --> 00:04:03.761
(Hachiko gasps)
(dramatic music)

00:04:03.861 --> 00:04:05.064
- These tomatoes are delicious.

00:04:05.164 --> 00:04:07.034
Where'd you get them from?

00:04:08.103 --> 00:04:10.140
- Jun, my friend, Jun.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.478
Her family grows them
at home in the garden,

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:14.315
she gave them to me.

00:04:14.415 --> 00:04:15.718
- Oh, cool.

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:17.789
- Tomato, Takumi likes tomatoes!

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:19.560
Do you wanna take some home with
you?

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.564
I've got lots of them.

00:04:21.664 --> 00:04:22.899
- Hmm.

00:04:23.835 --> 00:04:25.605
I'd love to, but there's no
point.

00:04:25.705 --> 00:04:29.045
We're gonna be back on tour
again in a couple days.

00:04:29.145 --> 00:04:30.447
- Oh yeah, the tour.

00:04:30.548 --> 00:04:32.384
I was at your concert and I
loved it.

00:04:32.485 --> 00:04:36.159
I hope the rest of the tour
goes really well for you.

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:37.294
- Huh.

00:04:38.063 --> 00:04:39.833
(Hachiko giggles)

00:04:39.933 --> 00:04:41.302
(Takumi chuckles)

00:04:41.402 --> 00:04:44.475
- He's so cool, and he's so hot!

00:04:45.612 --> 00:04:46.179
What should I do?

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:49.152
This is too much, I can't even
move.

00:04:52.826 --> 00:04:54.362
(doorbell dings)

00:04:54.462 --> 00:04:54.997
- Hmm?

00:04:55.097 --> 00:04:55.865
- That must be Yasu.

00:04:55.965 --> 00:04:57.101
- Finally, what took the guy so
long?

00:04:57.201 --> 00:04:58.571
- Hachiko, get the door.

00:04:58.671 --> 00:05:00.007
- It's okay, I'll get it.

00:05:00.107 --> 00:05:03.548
(footsteps receding)

00:05:03.648 --> 00:05:04.750
(door opens)
- Hmm

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:06.887
- Yasu, long time no see, what's
up man?

00:05:06.987 --> 00:05:10.227
- Takumi, what the hell
are you doing here?

00:05:12.732 --> 00:05:14.469
- You went to school together?

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.937
- Yeah.

00:05:15.037 --> 00:05:16.774
Two of us went to the same
junior high,

00:05:16.874 --> 00:05:17.374
way back when.

00:05:17.475 --> 00:05:19.546
But we weren't friends
with each other at school.

00:05:19.646 --> 00:05:22.017
Actually, I didn't even
want to be friends with him.

00:05:22.117 --> 00:05:22.853
- You what?

00:05:22.953 --> 00:05:24.857
- How come I never knew about
this?

00:05:24.957 --> 00:05:25.725
- You were always doing stuff

00:05:25.825 --> 00:05:28.598
that pushed the limits of
acceptable human behavior.

00:05:28.698 --> 00:05:29.666
I don't know how you managed

00:05:29.766 --> 00:05:31.202
to keep yourself out of juve.

00:05:31.302 --> 00:05:34.008
- Unlike you, I have a
delicate sensibility.

00:05:34.108 --> 00:05:36.112
Life was difficult when
I was a kid.

00:05:36.212 --> 00:05:37.114
- When we finished junior high,

00:05:37.214 --> 00:05:38.951
we went to different high
schools.

00:05:39.051 --> 00:05:40.320
We both started playing in bands

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.160
and we'd see each other at
various gigs around town.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.997
That was when we became friends.

00:05:45.097 --> 00:05:47.067
- Well, it was a pretty small
town.

00:05:47.168 --> 00:05:48.236
We kept bumping into one another

00:05:48.336 --> 00:05:50.174
at rehearsal studios and
stuff like that.

00:05:50.274 --> 00:05:52.278
- I used to go to gigs
all the time back then,

00:05:52.378 --> 00:05:55.050
and Trap Nest always put
on the best live shows.

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:55.618
I remember thinking,

00:05:55.718 --> 00:05:57.722
"Damn, now there's a woman who
can sing."

00:05:57.822 --> 00:05:58.390
(can crunches)

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:59.358
- You just like the vocalist?

00:05:59.458 --> 00:06:01.262
- No, I loved everything about
you guys.

00:06:01.362 --> 00:06:04.402
- You better watch out Nobu,
Takumi bites.

00:06:04.503 --> 00:06:07.041
- Nobu's just got this
obsession with Reira.

00:06:07.141 --> 00:06:07.976
- Really?

00:06:08.076 --> 00:06:09.880
Then why don't I invite her over
as well?

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.149
- What?

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:12.218
- I'll give her a call.

00:06:12.318 --> 00:06:13.688
- You don't have to do that for
me.

00:06:13.788 --> 00:06:15.023
I just get all weird and
nervous.

00:06:15.123 --> 00:06:16.894
- Besides, she doesn't
know how to play Mahjong.

00:06:16.994 --> 00:06:18.096
- Do not call her.

00:06:18.196 --> 00:06:19.700
- She doesn't have to play.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:20.668
I just wanna meet her.

00:06:20.768 --> 00:06:22.539
- Yeah, me too.

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:24.710
- Well Yasu, is it okay with
you?

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:26.212
Should I invite her over?

00:06:26.312 --> 00:06:27.582
- Yeah, it's fine with me,

00:06:27.682 --> 00:06:30.387
but I don't know if she'll wanna
come.

00:06:30.487 --> 00:06:32.091
- [Takumi] Then I won't
tell her you're here.

00:06:32.191 --> 00:06:34.128
- [Yasu] Leave it alone, man.

00:06:34.228 --> 00:06:35.364
- Now wait a second.

00:06:35.464 --> 00:06:36.867
What exactly is going on here?

00:06:36.967 --> 00:06:40.173
Did something happen
between you and Reira, Yasu?

00:06:40.274 --> 00:06:42.344
- [Yasu] No, nothing, forget it.

00:06:42.444 --> 00:06:43.548
- You mean they don't know?

00:06:43.648 --> 00:06:44.616
- [Nobu] Know what?

00:06:44.716 --> 00:06:45.718
Tell me.

00:06:46.754 --> 00:06:47.789
(phone button beeps)

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:48.891
- She's not answering.

00:06:48.991 --> 00:06:51.229
Guess that's too bad, huh Yasu?

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.033
- Aha.

00:06:58.778 --> 00:07:01.215
(Ren munches)

00:07:01.316 --> 00:07:02.217
- These tomatoes are delicious.

00:07:02.318 --> 00:07:03.386
- Don't change the subject.

00:07:03.486 --> 00:07:05.725
- It's all cool, it's ancient
history.

00:07:05.825 --> 00:07:06.827
He and Reira used to go out

00:07:06.927 --> 00:07:07.796
with each other for a while.

00:07:07.896 --> 00:07:09.131
- What?
- What?

00:07:09.833 --> 00:07:10.400
(Hachiko sighs)

00:07:10.501 --> 00:07:11.637
- (groans) I don't believe this!

00:07:11.737 --> 00:07:13.641
Sometimes I really hate
you guys, you know that?

00:07:13.741 --> 00:07:16.212
You never tell me
anything that's going on.

00:07:16.312 --> 00:07:18.483
I've been left out once again.

00:07:18.584 --> 00:07:20.187
- We didn't leave you out on
purpose,

00:07:20.287 --> 00:07:21.790
we just didn't talk about it.

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:23.093
- Then start talking.

00:07:23.193 --> 00:07:24.563
- Reira and I were seeing each
other

00:07:24.663 --> 00:07:27.034
back when I was in the old band
with Ren.

00:07:27.134 --> 00:07:29.573
We broke up before I even met
you guys.

00:07:29.673 --> 00:07:32.044
So there was no reason
to tell you anything.

00:07:32.144 --> 00:07:34.616
- And the breakup was really
hard on you.

00:07:34.716 --> 00:07:36.553
That's why you didn't wanna talk
about it.

00:07:36.654 --> 00:07:39.358
- It wasn't that bad,
stop making things up.

00:07:39.458 --> 00:07:42.097
- She had you wrapped
around her little finger.

00:07:42.197 --> 00:07:44.302
- [Yasu] No, that's just the way
she is.

00:07:44.402 --> 00:07:45.304
- Whatever you say.

00:07:45.404 --> 00:07:48.410
- So tell me, is Reira
really like that with guys?

00:07:48.511 --> 00:07:50.648
- Yeah, but that's when
she was in high school,

00:07:50.748 --> 00:07:53.153
and man, did she look
cute in that uniform?

00:07:53.253 --> 00:07:54.088
I was gonna ask her out,

00:07:54.188 --> 00:07:56.225
but Yasu got to her first, too
bad.

00:07:56.326 --> 00:07:57.562
- Oh yeah?

00:07:57.662 --> 00:07:59.165
- How long did you guys go out
for?

00:07:59.265 --> 00:08:00.735
- Not long.

00:08:00.835 --> 00:08:02.071
Can we change this subject now?

00:08:02.171 --> 00:08:03.106
- You guys were together

00:08:03.206 --> 00:08:04.175
for about a year, weren't you?

00:08:04.275 --> 00:08:05.043
- That long?

00:08:05.143 --> 00:08:06.346
- Actually, it was more like two
years.

00:08:06.446 --> 00:08:07.481
- You call that not long?

00:08:07.582 --> 00:08:09.586
- So why'd you guys break up?

00:08:10.588 --> 00:08:13.093
- Enough already, give me a
break.

00:08:13.193 --> 00:08:15.631
I'm not too good at defending
myself.

00:08:16.299 --> 00:08:18.403
(tap water running)

00:08:18.504 --> 00:08:21.677
- Why do I suddenly feel so
depressed?

00:08:22.478 --> 00:08:23.514
I was totally happy

00:08:23.614 --> 00:08:26.419
when I found out about Nana and
Ren,

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:29.358
but this thing about Yasu and
Reira dating,

00:08:29.458 --> 00:08:32.064
kind of bothers me.

00:08:32.164 --> 00:08:33.233
It might have ended long ago,

00:08:33.333 --> 00:08:35.404
but still, he dated a girl

00:08:35.505 --> 00:08:39.078
who was so beautiful and
talented.

00:08:39.178 --> 00:08:41.884
Why would he pay any attention
to me?

00:08:41.984 --> 00:08:44.021
I can't compete with her,

00:08:44.121 --> 00:08:46.359
we're worlds apart.

00:08:46.459 --> 00:08:48.831
Now Yasu seems out of my league.

00:08:49.365 --> 00:08:50.067
Then again,

00:08:50.167 --> 00:08:51.436
everyone here is from a
different world,

00:08:51.537 --> 00:08:54.308
not like plain old me.

00:08:55.912 --> 00:08:56.780
They're only nice to me

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:58.751
'cause I'm Nana's roommate.

00:08:58.851 --> 00:09:02.157
(melodious music)

00:09:04.228 --> 00:09:05.464
- It's your turn Hachi,

00:09:05.565 --> 00:09:07.669
stop being such a space cadet.

00:09:07.769 --> 00:09:08.436
- Oh, I'm sorry.

00:09:08.537 --> 00:09:10.541
- I don't blame you,
playing cards is boring.

00:09:10.641 --> 00:09:11.643
This game is for little kids.

00:09:11.744 --> 00:09:13.246
- You're the one who
said you wanted to play.

00:09:13.346 --> 00:09:15.752
- Hachiko, what happened to all
the beer?

00:09:15.852 --> 00:09:16.553
I thought we had more.

00:09:16.653 --> 00:09:18.089
- I put everything in the
fridge,

00:09:18.189 --> 00:09:19.158
are they gone already?

00:09:19.258 --> 00:09:19.726
- We're out of wine too.

00:09:19.826 --> 00:09:22.030
- Wait, did you drink that all
yourself?

00:09:22.131 --> 00:09:23.366
- Damn, you guys.

00:09:23.466 --> 00:09:26.038
Nobu, we need you to make a beer
run.

00:09:26.139 --> 00:09:27.976
Beer, wine, sake and shochu.

00:09:28.076 --> 00:09:29.211
- Why do I have to go?

00:09:29.311 --> 00:09:30.213
I haven't been drinking.

00:09:30.313 --> 00:09:31.583
- [Nana] So? Who else would go?

00:09:31.683 --> 00:09:33.153
- Get me some smokes too, okay?

00:09:33.253 --> 00:09:35.390
(Nobu groans)

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:38.163
- Damn, I might as well
start drinking again.

00:09:38.263 --> 00:09:39.966
- Wait up Nobu, I wanna go with
you.

00:09:40.067 --> 00:09:40.968
You won't be able to carry it

00:09:41.069 --> 00:09:42.605
all back by yourself.

00:09:46.345 --> 00:09:49.151
- I still can't believe that
about Yasu.

00:09:49.251 --> 00:09:50.454
I'm in total shock.

00:09:50.555 --> 00:09:52.257
(shoes tapping on the road)

00:09:52.357 --> 00:09:52.859
- All right.

00:09:52.959 --> 00:09:55.063
You've got a big crush on Reira,
don't you?

00:09:55.163 --> 00:09:56.299
It's completely understandable,

00:09:56.399 --> 00:09:58.036
she's so beautiful.
- Huh?

00:09:58.136 --> 00:09:59.205
Oh no, that's not it.

00:09:59.305 --> 00:10:00.207
I was just surprised

00:10:00.307 --> 00:10:01.476
that he kept it all a secret.

00:10:01.577 --> 00:10:03.346
I mean, I know Reira is
beautiful,

00:10:03.446 --> 00:10:04.482
and she's a great singer,

00:10:04.583 --> 00:10:07.020
but even so, I'm not a huge fan
of hers.

00:10:07.121 --> 00:10:08.791
I guess I'm just fascinated by
her

00:10:08.891 --> 00:10:09.726
'cause she's famous.

00:10:09.826 --> 00:10:10.327
- Really?

00:10:10.427 --> 00:10:12.397
But when Blast gets signed
by a big record label,

00:10:12.498 --> 00:10:13.934
I'm sure you'll be famous too!

00:10:14.034 --> 00:10:14.970
Just wait and see.

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:15.938
- Huh?

00:10:16.038 --> 00:10:16.807
- What do you mean huh?

00:10:16.907 --> 00:10:19.245
Don't tell me you don't
wanna hit the big time.

00:10:19.345 --> 00:10:20.080
- Well, yeah, I guess so.

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:22.719
But for me it's never been
about becoming famous.

00:10:22.819 --> 00:10:25.390
It's about becoming a successful
musician.

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:26.392
You know, it'd be nice

00:10:26.492 --> 00:10:28.964
if I could just make a
living with my guitar.

00:10:29.064 --> 00:10:31.503
- Wow Nobu, you really
are totally obsessed

00:10:31.603 --> 00:10:33.439
with playing the guitar, aren't
you?

00:10:33.541 --> 00:10:34.843
You're not just into music

00:10:34.943 --> 00:10:37.014
'cause you wanna become
some famous rockstar,

00:10:37.114 --> 00:10:38.551
and I think that's cool.

00:10:38.651 --> 00:10:41.122
We're different 'cause I
totally get star struck.

00:10:41.222 --> 00:10:42.157
- Well, of course I wouldn't
mind

00:10:42.257 --> 00:10:45.932
if it turns out that I do
become a famous rockstar.

00:10:46.032 --> 00:10:46.733
(Hachiko laughs)

00:10:46.834 --> 00:10:47.502
- I knew it.

00:10:47.602 --> 00:10:48.403
- You know, there's something

00:10:48.504 --> 00:10:49.472
about what we're doing in Blast

00:10:49.573 --> 00:10:51.342
that just makes me wanna go for
it.

00:10:51.442 --> 00:10:53.446
I really believe we've
got a chance to make it

00:10:53.547 --> 00:10:55.283
if we go all out.

00:10:55.383 --> 00:10:58.289
(shoes tapping on the road)

00:10:58.389 --> 00:10:59.993
Now that Nana's back with Ren,

00:11:00.093 --> 00:11:01.195
she's even more competitive

00:11:01.295 --> 00:11:02.932
than she ever was before.

00:11:03.032 --> 00:11:04.769
And you know how Shin started
playing bass

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:06.773
because he wanted to be better
than Ren?

00:11:06.874 --> 00:11:09.111
Well Ren was the musician I
wanted to be

00:11:09.211 --> 00:11:11.182
when I was starting out too.

00:11:11.282 --> 00:11:12.384
And then there's Yasu,

00:11:12.484 --> 00:11:13.286
who's always against us

00:11:13.386 --> 00:11:15.190
trying to get a record deal.

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:17.529
But even he's going for it now.

00:11:18.129 --> 00:11:20.233
(cheerful music)

00:11:20.333 --> 00:11:22.705
So everything seems perfect, you
know,

00:11:22.805 --> 00:11:25.511
we're gonna beat Trap Nest.

00:11:30.187 --> 00:11:32.792
- You know, with Reira and
Yasu having this history,

00:11:32.892 --> 00:11:34.261
that means there's one more
thing

00:11:34.361 --> 00:11:35.798
that connects Trap Nest and
Blast.

00:11:35.898 --> 00:11:38.369
It's like your destinies are
intertwined!

00:11:38.469 --> 00:11:40.273
- Intertwined destinies?

00:11:40.373 --> 00:11:42.377
I guess it could be possible.

00:11:42.477 --> 00:11:45.651
But we're not ready to take them
on yet.

00:11:45.751 --> 00:11:48.456
- I wonder why the two of them
broke up.

00:11:49.358 --> 00:11:50.327
- This is only a guess,

00:11:50.427 --> 00:11:51.563
but maybe it has something to do

00:11:51.663 --> 00:11:53.233
with when Reira removed to Tokyo

00:11:53.333 --> 00:11:54.134
so she could make it big

00:11:54.235 --> 00:11:55.938
with the other guys in Trap
Nest.

00:11:56.038 --> 00:11:58.443
Back then, Yasu was so busy
studying

00:11:58.544 --> 00:11:59.378
to become a lawyer,

00:11:59.478 --> 00:12:02.317
the band was more of a
side project for him.

00:12:02.417 --> 00:12:02.919
The two of them

00:12:03.019 --> 00:12:04.589
obviously had different goals in
life.

00:12:04.689 --> 00:12:07.896
Any future they would've
had together was doomed.

00:12:07.996 --> 00:12:09.131
(Hachiko sighs)

00:12:09.231 --> 00:12:10.668
(melodious music)

00:12:10.768 --> 00:12:12.505
- Okay, so if that was the only
reason

00:12:12.605 --> 00:12:14.609
for Yasu and Reira breaking up,

00:12:14.709 --> 00:12:16.212
maybe now that things have
changed,

00:12:16.312 --> 00:12:18.249
they can get back together
again,

00:12:18.349 --> 00:12:20.320
just like Ren and Nana.

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:20.888
- I doubt it.

00:12:20.988 --> 00:12:22.759
You can't compare the two
situations.

00:12:22.859 --> 00:12:24.963
I think Ren and Nana have
something

00:12:25.063 --> 00:12:25.965
pretty unique going on.

00:12:26.065 --> 00:12:26.967
- Oh yeah? How so?

00:12:27.067 --> 00:12:29.773
You know, they've got something
special.

00:12:29.873 --> 00:12:30.875
How many couples do you know

00:12:30.975 --> 00:12:33.479
who'd still be so obsessively
in love with each other

00:12:33.581 --> 00:12:34.849
after being apart for two years?

00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:37.655
You gotta admit, it's not
normal.

00:12:37.755 --> 00:12:40.661
You'd think their feelings
would've changed by now.

00:12:40.761 --> 00:12:42.030
It's rare to meet someone

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:43.701
you're drawn to that strongly,

00:12:43.801 --> 00:12:46.607
and make such a lasting
connection.

00:12:46.707 --> 00:12:48.443
- So Nana found true love.

00:12:48.544 --> 00:12:49.846
Oh, I love stories like that!

00:12:49.946 --> 00:12:50.447
- Really?

00:12:50.548 --> 00:12:52.417
I like all that slushy stuff
too.

00:12:52.518 --> 00:12:53.621
I'm a romantic at heart.

00:12:53.721 --> 00:12:55.390
- (laughs) You? Romantic? Get
outta here.

00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:56.459
- Well, I am.

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:57.795
What's so funny about that?

00:12:57.895 --> 00:13:01.235
- I sure hope I'll meet
someone like that one day,

00:13:01.335 --> 00:13:03.172
my own true love.

00:13:03.273 --> 00:13:03.741
- Till then,

00:13:03.841 --> 00:13:05.243
I'm happy with a few
distractions

00:13:05.343 --> 00:13:07.047
like Aki from the corner store.

00:13:07.147 --> 00:13:08.149
- Who's she?

00:13:08.249 --> 00:13:09.218
You mean the girl we just saw

00:13:09.318 --> 00:13:09.886
at the cash register?

00:13:09.986 --> 00:13:13.426
- (chuckles) Nah, she's just
an imaginary crush of mine.

00:13:13.527 --> 00:13:16.399
Same as Mio from the smoke shop.

00:13:16.499 --> 00:13:18.771
- A virtual Aki and a virtual
Mio?

00:13:18.871 --> 00:13:20.908
He's just as crazy as me.

00:13:21.008 --> 00:13:22.745
This is the first time Nobu and
I

00:13:22.845 --> 00:13:25.417
have ever really talked
about stuff on our own.

00:13:25.518 --> 00:13:27.588
We've got a lot in common.

00:13:29.091 --> 00:13:29.826
(can pops)

00:13:29.926 --> 00:13:30.962
Nobu, what are you doing?

00:13:31.062 --> 00:13:32.865
I thought you decided to stop
drinking.

00:13:32.966 --> 00:13:34.435
You know you can't hold your
liquor.

00:13:34.536 --> 00:13:36.072
- Yeah. But even when I don't
drink,

00:13:36.172 --> 00:13:37.407
nothing good happens.

00:13:37.508 --> 00:13:38.944
My family's disowned me,

00:13:39.044 --> 00:13:39.813
I gotta get the beer,

00:13:39.913 --> 00:13:42.284
I can't play Mahjong, and I'm
short.

00:13:42.384 --> 00:13:46.058
(Hachiko and Nobu laugh)

00:13:48.296 --> 00:13:50.568
- You feel a lot better now.

00:13:50.668 --> 00:13:52.638
If I had a boyfriend like Nobu,

00:13:52.739 --> 00:13:54.676
I know I'd have a lot of fun.

00:13:56.913 --> 00:13:57.447
What am I doing

00:13:57.548 --> 00:13:58.951
thinking about Nobu like that?

00:13:59.051 --> 00:14:01.288
Just 'cause Yasu's out of the
picture?

00:14:01.389 --> 00:14:02.992
I must be boy crazy.

00:14:03.092 --> 00:14:05.463
But it's not like I go for just
anyone.

00:14:05.564 --> 00:14:08.537
Jun was right, my garden's too
ripe.

00:14:08.637 --> 00:14:11.042
But I guess it doesn't hurt to
ask.

00:14:11.142 --> 00:14:14.616
So Nobu, do you have a
girlfriend right now?

00:14:14.716 --> 00:14:17.689
- Not right now, why?

00:14:17.789 --> 00:14:20.561
Do you know anyone who's
available?

00:14:21.228 --> 00:14:22.932
- Maybe I should apply.

00:14:25.103 --> 00:14:25.604
What?

00:14:25.705 --> 00:14:27.040
Takumi went home?

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:28.977
- Yeah, he got a call in his
cell,

00:14:29.078 --> 00:14:29.879
sounded important.

00:14:29.979 --> 00:14:31.382
Must have been some woman.

00:14:31.482 --> 00:14:33.019
- I'm sure it was, knowing him,

00:14:33.119 --> 00:14:34.254
a man with no morals.

00:14:34.355 --> 00:14:35.758
- Oh yeah, you're one to talk.

00:14:35.858 --> 00:14:38.329
- Nana, why didn't you
at least make him stay

00:14:38.429 --> 00:14:39.231
till I got back?

00:14:39.331 --> 00:14:39.833
How could you do this to me?

00:14:39.933 --> 00:14:42.471
- Hachiko, you need to
forget about Takumi.

00:14:42.572 --> 00:14:44.341
He's a total player, stay away
from him.

00:14:44.441 --> 00:14:45.845
- I don't care about that!

00:14:45.945 --> 00:14:47.314
- Okay. If you're cool with it,

00:14:47.414 --> 00:14:47.915
do whatever you want.

00:14:48.015 --> 00:14:48.884
- That's not what I meant.

00:14:48.984 --> 00:14:50.621
I just wanted to get his
autograph

00:14:50.721 --> 00:14:51.990
before he left tonight.

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:54.161
- Oh, so that's what this is
about.

00:14:54.261 --> 00:14:54.929
(Ren laughs)

00:14:55.029 --> 00:14:56.733
- Don't cry Hachiko, it's okay.

00:14:56.833 --> 00:14:59.672
I can get his autograph
for you, no problem.

00:14:59.773 --> 00:15:01.777
- Hachiko, it's so sweet

00:15:01.877 --> 00:15:03.413
that he's calling me Hachiko.

00:15:03.514 --> 00:15:05.150
Can I have your autograph?

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:05.885
- Now she likes me.

00:15:05.985 --> 00:15:07.755
- I guess anyone will do.

00:15:07.855 --> 00:15:09.793
(Hachiko chugging)

00:15:09.893 --> 00:15:12.364
- It's been quite a roller
coaster,

00:15:12.464 --> 00:15:13.901
but what an amazing day!

00:15:14.001 --> 00:15:15.336
- Interesting how she's gone
back

00:15:15.437 --> 00:15:17.340
to her usual self since Takumi
left.

00:15:17.441 --> 00:15:18.409
- She must have been nervous.

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:19.946
- Yeah, I was too.

00:15:20.046 --> 00:15:21.917
- You liar.

00:15:22.017 --> 00:15:24.354
- The only conversation I had
with Takumi

00:15:24.455 --> 00:15:25.457
was about the tomatoes

00:15:25.558 --> 00:15:28.530
that came from Jun's
mom and dad's garden.

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:29.899
I was so happy.

00:15:29.999 --> 00:15:32.037
He was actually talking to me.

00:15:32.137 --> 00:15:34.843
But why are we never
happy with what we have?

00:15:34.943 --> 00:15:36.813
We always seem to want more.

00:15:39.485 --> 00:15:42.859
(cell phone rings)

00:15:43.727 --> 00:15:45.196
(groans) Who's calling now?

00:15:45.296 --> 00:15:47.300
Just lemme sleep a little more.

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:51.308
(cell phone keeps ringing)

00:15:53.045 --> 00:15:55.718
Shin, what are you doing in my
bed?

00:15:55.818 --> 00:15:57.688
- It feels nice and cozy.

00:15:57.789 --> 00:15:59.224
Did we do it?

00:15:59.324 --> 00:16:00.360
- Nothing happened.

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:02.565
You didn't pay me for it, Hachi.

00:16:02.665 --> 00:16:05.003
(Hachiko gasps)

00:16:05.103 --> 00:16:09.344
- Shin, don't say that,
that's prostitution.

00:16:09.445 --> 00:16:11.282
What should I do about him?

00:16:11.382 --> 00:16:13.754
Does he really do it for money?

00:16:13.854 --> 00:16:14.923
I guess I always wondered,

00:16:15.023 --> 00:16:18.362
but still, he's young and he's
cute,

00:16:18.463 --> 00:16:19.899
the ladies must love him.

00:16:19.999 --> 00:16:22.772
I mean, I thought he was
just sleeping around.

00:16:22.872 --> 00:16:25.376
But if he's expecting something
in return,

00:16:25.477 --> 00:16:26.713
he's too young for that.

00:16:26.813 --> 00:16:29.051
Shouldn't I say something
to him?

00:16:31.255 --> 00:16:32.892
Hmm, only Nobu's here?

00:16:32.992 --> 00:16:34.428
What happened to Yasu?

00:16:34.529 --> 00:16:36.432
Did he go home?

00:16:36.533 --> 00:16:38.436
Looks like someone cleaned up,

00:16:38.537 --> 00:16:39.506
bet it was Yasu.

00:16:39.606 --> 00:16:41.375
He's so sweet.

00:16:41.475 --> 00:16:43.112
Where are Ren and Nana?

00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:47.420
Oh. (chuckles)

00:16:47.522 --> 00:16:48.389
(cell phone rings)

00:16:48.489 --> 00:16:49.559
My phone!

00:16:49.659 --> 00:16:50.861
- Oh hi Nana, is that you?

00:16:50.961 --> 00:16:52.397
Thank goodness, I was getting
worried

00:16:52.497 --> 00:16:53.499
'cause I called a few times

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:54.836
and no one picked up.

00:16:54.936 --> 00:16:56.573
Knowing how much you drank last
night,

00:16:56.673 --> 00:16:57.174
I just wanted to call

00:16:57.274 --> 00:16:59.278
and see how you were doing this
morning.

00:16:59.378 --> 00:17:00.681
Were you already getting up?

00:17:00.781 --> 00:17:03.954
- Yeah, thanks, I just got out
of bed.

00:17:04.054 --> 00:17:06.025
- I guess it's okay to
show up in the afternoon

00:17:06.125 --> 00:17:08.262
when you work for a publisher.

00:17:08.362 --> 00:17:11.235
(Hachiko gasps)

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.051
- No, it's not okay!

00:17:19.151 --> 00:17:22.090
(dramatic music)

00:17:26.666 --> 00:17:28.336
- You got hay fever?

00:17:28.436 --> 00:17:28.871
(Hachiko coughs)

00:17:28.971 --> 00:17:30.708
Oh, you've got a cold, is that
it?

00:17:30.808 --> 00:17:31.943
Are you all right?

00:17:32.043 --> 00:17:33.346
You shouldn't come in to work

00:17:33.446 --> 00:17:35.083
when you're that sick.

00:17:35.183 --> 00:17:38.155
Actually, you don't
have to come in at all.

00:17:40.493 --> 00:17:42.565
- Miss Sakagami,

00:17:42.665 --> 00:17:44.468
I think the boss just fired me!

00:17:44.569 --> 00:17:46.238
- Of course he did.

00:17:46.338 --> 00:17:47.073
- I can't believe it.

00:17:47.173 --> 00:17:48.977
I know you were always
really strict with me

00:17:49.077 --> 00:17:50.681
but I thought you were on my
side

00:17:50.781 --> 00:17:51.816
and you'd stand up for me.

00:17:51.917 --> 00:17:54.454
- The world doesn't
just revolve around you!

00:17:54.556 --> 00:17:57.528
You have no idea how much
of a slacker you are.

00:17:57.628 --> 00:17:58.830
Goodbye!

00:18:06.513 --> 00:18:07.347
- When I need a drink,

00:18:07.447 --> 00:18:11.355
I can buy a can of coffee for
120 Yen.

00:18:11.455 --> 00:18:15.363
But I'd rather sit in
sip tea at a fancy cafe.

00:18:16.666 --> 00:18:19.872
I wanna live in a nice place.

00:18:19.973 --> 00:18:22.878
I wanna wear cool clothes.

00:18:22.979 --> 00:18:25.818
See all the latest films,

00:18:25.918 --> 00:18:28.489
buy the latest cell phone,

00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:30.761
get my driver's license,

00:18:31.462 --> 00:18:33.065
go traveling.

00:18:33.867 --> 00:18:36.105
So I need a job.

00:18:36.205 --> 00:18:38.677
I have to get it together.

00:18:38.777 --> 00:18:40.013
I don't mind working hard

00:18:40.113 --> 00:18:43.820
if it means I can have all that
stuff.

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:46.458
No matter how much stuff I think
I want,

00:18:46.559 --> 00:18:48.797
it's never enough.

00:18:48.897 --> 00:18:52.203
I don't even have the energy to
stand up.

00:18:52.304 --> 00:18:56.913
I just want one thing to go
right for me.

00:18:57.013 --> 00:18:58.750
Something that'll give me the
energy

00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:00.821
so I can keep going.

00:19:00.921 --> 00:19:04.529
(cell phone rings)

00:19:04.629 --> 00:19:08.002
(bag zipper opens)

00:19:09.672 --> 00:19:10.440
Hello?

00:19:10.541 --> 00:19:11.843
- Is this Nana?
(Hachiko gasps)

00:19:11.943 --> 00:19:14.782
It's me, Takumi.
(Hachiko gasps)

00:19:14.882 --> 00:19:16.318
Can you talk right now?

00:19:17.855 --> 00:19:18.724
- Yeah.

00:19:18.824 --> 00:19:20.093
- Sorry about yesterday.

00:19:20.193 --> 00:19:20.995
You made us a ton of food

00:19:21.095 --> 00:19:22.832
and I left without saying
anything.

00:19:22.932 --> 00:19:23.734
I wanted to say thank you.

00:19:23.834 --> 00:19:25.637
So, I hope you don't mind,

00:19:25.738 --> 00:19:27.508
but I got your number from Ren.

00:19:27.608 --> 00:19:28.442
- Oh thanks.

00:19:28.543 --> 00:19:29.277
But I wish I could have prepared

00:19:29.378 --> 00:19:30.013
something nicer for you.

00:19:30.113 --> 00:19:32.652
- [Takumi] Nana, you're a great
cook.

00:19:32.752 --> 00:19:34.956
It was perfect, thank you.

00:19:36.492 --> 00:19:37.494
Are you at work?

00:19:37.595 --> 00:19:39.264
Sorry, you must be busy.

00:19:40.934 --> 00:19:41.603
- No, it's cool.

00:19:41.703 --> 00:19:43.507
I'm just wandering around.

00:19:43.607 --> 00:19:44.909
- [Takumi] Wandering around?

00:19:45.009 --> 00:19:46.178
Where are you?

00:19:46.278 --> 00:19:47.180
- Omotesando.

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:48.449
- What? Really?

00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:50.420
I'm in Omotesando too.

00:19:50.521 --> 00:19:51.455
I'm stuck in traffic.

00:19:51.556 --> 00:19:52.692
- No way!

00:19:52.792 --> 00:19:53.359
Oh, whereabouts?

00:19:53.459 --> 00:19:55.564
- [Takumi] I'm heading towards
Harajuku,

00:19:55.664 --> 00:19:57.500
w-well, sort of.

00:19:57.601 --> 00:19:58.102
- Harajuku?

00:19:58.202 --> 00:20:00.006
That means he's on the
other side of the street!

00:20:00.106 --> 00:20:02.143
- [Takumi] Traffic's at a
standstill.

00:20:02.243 --> 00:20:03.479
Right now I'm in front of Gucci.

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:04.649
- What kind of car?

00:20:04.749 --> 00:20:05.651
- [Takumi] A black G Wagon.

00:20:05.751 --> 00:20:09.124
- A G what? What does it look
like?

00:20:09.224 --> 00:20:10.761
- [Takumi] It's a black SUV.

00:20:10.861 --> 00:20:13.332
It's pretty big, so it should
stand out.

00:20:14.769 --> 00:20:16.472
- Oh, I see you!

00:20:16.573 --> 00:20:19.378
- (Takumi chuckles) Come over
here then.

00:20:19.478 --> 00:20:22.618
- That was the summer I was 20
years old.

00:20:24.287 --> 00:20:26.593
- [Takumi] Jump in and let's go
somewhere.

00:20:26.693 --> 00:20:27.895
Are you hungry?

00:20:29.097 --> 00:20:31.402
- I felt empty inside.

00:20:31.503 --> 00:20:31.970
And the only way

00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:34.776
I thought I could fill that
emptiness,

00:20:34.876 --> 00:20:36.913
was by falling in love.

00:20:37.681 --> 00:20:39.786
- Man, Hachiko is late.

00:20:39.886 --> 00:20:40.988
Should we go ahead and eat?

00:20:41.088 --> 00:20:42.858
- Maybe she's just given us some
space.

00:20:42.958 --> 00:20:44.729
She must have seen the do not
disturb sign

00:20:44.829 --> 00:20:45.664
on the bedroom door.

00:20:45.764 --> 00:20:46.866
- My faithful Hachiko,

00:20:46.966 --> 00:20:48.369
behaving like a well trained
puppy,

00:20:48.469 --> 00:20:50.841
unlike the other stray
dogs we've got with us.

00:20:50.941 --> 00:20:52.310
- You got that right.

00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:54.615
- So when are you guys gonna be
leaving?

00:20:54.715 --> 00:20:56.953
(Shin and Nobu chuckling)

00:20:57.053 --> 00:20:58.690
- In those days Nana,

00:20:58.790 --> 00:20:59.792
everything in your world

00:20:59.892 --> 00:21:02.531
looked so shiny and sparkling,

00:21:02.631 --> 00:21:04.401
luring me in.

00:21:04.502 --> 00:21:07.173
It wasn't that I'd go out with
any guy,

00:21:07.808 --> 00:21:08.844
I just wanted to bask

00:21:08.944 --> 00:21:11.248
in your bright shining light.
