00:00:01.169 --> 00:00:02.606
(forlorn guitar music)

00:00:03.787 --> 00:00:05.891
- [Nana] They say the more
you fight with someone,

00:00:05.991 --> 00:00:07.728
the closer you are to them.

00:00:07.828 --> 00:00:10.801
But ultimately, fighting
is nothing more than egos

00:00:10.901 --> 00:00:12.638
slamming into each other.

00:00:12.738 --> 00:00:14.842
Just cause you may have
revealed your true feelings

00:00:14.942 --> 00:00:18.449
doesn't mean people are
gonna understand you better.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.386
I know it's impossible to go
through life

00:00:20.486 --> 00:00:23.225
without ever getting hurt,

00:00:23.325 --> 00:00:25.396
but I realized that I
had to try my hardest

00:00:25.496 --> 00:00:28.903
to live without hurting
the people around me.

00:00:29.004 --> 00:00:30.874
I finally figured that out.

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.550
(energetic rock music)

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.349
(people chattering)

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:18.489
(phone ringing)

00:02:21.395 --> 00:02:24.769
(traffic bustling)

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:28.442
(phone beeping)

00:02:29.377 --> 00:02:32.450
(phone beeping)

00:02:33.118 --> 00:02:35.991
(phone beeping)

00:02:37.961 --> 00:02:40.834
(phone beeping)

00:02:47.714 --> 00:02:50.186
- Good morning, Reira, how are
you doing?

00:02:50.286 --> 00:02:51.455
I hope you slept well.

00:02:51.556 --> 00:02:53.693
- Yeah, I didn't take any of
those pills

00:02:53.793 --> 00:02:55.964
so I don't feel so
knocked out this morning.

00:02:56.064 --> 00:02:57.200
- Oh, I'm glad to hear that,

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.469
'cause we've got a full day
today

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.308
of interviews and
radio talk shows.

00:03:01.408 --> 00:03:02.176
- A full day?

00:03:02.276 --> 00:03:02.678
- Yup.

00:03:02.778 --> 00:03:05.116
This morning, you have an
interview here in the hotel

00:03:05.216 --> 00:03:06.251
with a woman's magazine.

00:03:06.351 --> 00:03:07.320
This afternoon, you've got a
bunch

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.823
of music magazine
interviews.

00:03:08.923 --> 00:03:11.629
Three on your own and two
quickies with the whole band.

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:13.867
Then tonight...

00:03:13.967 --> 00:03:17.173
I'm so sorry for cramming
all this into one day.

00:03:17.273 --> 00:03:19.077
- (sighs) The recording
got pushed back

00:03:19.177 --> 00:03:20.547
because I wasn't feeling well.

00:03:20.647 --> 00:03:22.283
I'm the one who should
be apologizing.

00:03:22.383 --> 00:03:23.285
- It's okay.

00:03:23.385 --> 00:03:24.522
- Can I jump in the shower?

00:03:24.622 --> 00:03:26.258
Is there enough time for that?

00:03:26.358 --> 00:03:26.759
- Of course.

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:29.464
Hair and makeup should be
here in about half an hour.

00:03:29.565 --> 00:03:30.967
What would you like to have
for breakfast?

00:03:31.067 --> 00:03:32.938
- Just order something
from room service,

00:03:33.038 --> 00:03:34.542
whatever you think is good.

00:03:34.642 --> 00:03:35.644
- Sure.

00:03:38.983 --> 00:03:40.052
Huh?

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:51.676
- Huh?

00:03:53.445 --> 00:03:56.418
(necklace rattles)

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:59.558
(gentle music)

00:04:00.827 --> 00:04:03.298
You left it on purpose,
didn't you?

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:08.408
(Reira chuckles)

00:04:11.883 --> 00:04:14.354
- [Nana] I didn't have
to work that day,

00:04:14.454 --> 00:04:16.358
and I slept soundly
in Ren's arms

00:04:16.458 --> 00:04:19.197
for the first time in
a long time.

00:04:19.297 --> 00:04:23.606
I woke up feeling that all
my problems had melted away.

00:04:25.911 --> 00:04:28.917
Damn, I left my umbrella
at Ren's place.

00:04:32.925 --> 00:04:36.464
Tell him I won't be
seeing him for a while.

00:04:36.566 --> 00:04:39.304
I bet Nobu never even
told him anything.

00:04:39.404 --> 00:04:41.542
What's that guy good for anyway?

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:47.588
- Is your pride that
important to you?

00:04:51.261 --> 00:04:52.798
- There, there.

00:04:54.334 --> 00:04:57.006
Until Blast really makes it big,

00:04:57.106 --> 00:04:58.308
I don't think I'll ever get over

00:04:58.408 --> 00:05:01.214
my feelings for Ren
and Trapnest.

00:05:01.314 --> 00:05:03.252
(rain pattering)

00:05:03.352 --> 00:05:04.889
But when I'm with him,

00:05:04.989 --> 00:05:08.596
I always just dive right
back in like this

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:11.468
'cause I love him.

00:05:14.742 --> 00:05:16.545
It's that simple.

00:05:18.549 --> 00:05:20.620
The strawberry glasses are no
longer

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.691
in the kitchen cupboard.

00:05:22.791 --> 00:05:26.832
I couldn't believe Hachi
would've taken my glass too.

00:05:26.933 --> 00:05:29.838
But then I realized that
they were both broken.

00:05:30.874 --> 00:05:33.111
And that made me feel terrible.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.186
(rain pattering)

00:05:37.286 --> 00:05:40.961
- The truth is those two
strawberry glasses broke.

00:05:41.061 --> 00:05:41.762
(Nana gasps)

00:05:41.862 --> 00:05:46.004
Takumi told me, "Your lady's
got anger management problems.

00:05:46.104 --> 00:05:47.975
Get her under control."

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:49.477
- Under control?

00:05:49.578 --> 00:05:50.614
- Takumi said that when she saw

00:05:50.714 --> 00:05:53.519
the broken pieces on the
floor, Hachiko freaked out

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.824
and it took forever to
get her to calm down.

00:05:55.924 --> 00:05:59.430
I guess they thought that
you broke them on purpose.

00:05:59.531 --> 00:06:01.067
And it is kind of
hard to believe

00:06:01.167 --> 00:06:04.508
that they were both
broken by accident.

00:06:04.608 --> 00:06:06.712
It's not hard to understand
why Hachiko would leave

00:06:06.812 --> 00:06:09.384
without saying anything.

00:06:09.484 --> 00:06:11.689
Those glasses were
precious to her.

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:14.060
Breaking them was like
a message saying,

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:19.003
"I never wanna have anything
to do with you again."

00:06:19.103 --> 00:06:21.609
- Goddamn it, I didn't
mean it that way.

00:06:21.709 --> 00:06:23.980
- [Ren] Then what way
did you mean it?

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:24.615
- I don't know.

00:06:24.715 --> 00:06:26.986
- You really don't
remember, do you?

00:06:27.086 --> 00:06:29.658
And what about drowning
your cell phone?

00:06:29.758 --> 00:06:30.694
- [Nana] (sighs) Sorry for that.

00:06:30.794 --> 00:06:32.864
And it was so sweet of
you to buy it for me.

00:06:32.964 --> 00:06:34.300
I don't know what came over me.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.438
- Nah, don't worry
about the phone.

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:38.175
We can always go
buy another one.

00:06:38.275 --> 00:06:41.348
- Geez, I can't believe I
lost all my phone numbers

00:06:41.448 --> 00:06:42.718
and email addresses.

00:06:42.818 --> 00:06:44.755
I should have written
them down somewhere.

00:06:44.855 --> 00:06:46.959
- [Ren] Well I bet the
few friends you have

00:06:47.059 --> 00:06:48.295
are friends of mine too.

00:06:48.395 --> 00:06:49.898
You want their numbers?

00:06:49.999 --> 00:06:51.535
Here.

00:06:51.635 --> 00:06:54.207
- Huh, yeah, thanks.

00:06:55.476 --> 00:06:56.879
- I've gotta recharge it.

00:06:56.979 --> 00:06:57.547
- Ah!

00:06:57.647 --> 00:06:58.950
(lighter thumps)

00:06:59.050 --> 00:06:59.551
(charger bangs)

00:06:59.651 --> 00:07:00.587
- Do it, right now.

00:07:00.687 --> 00:07:02.189
- I can't, I gotta get outta
here.

00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:04.661
You've got practice tonight
at the studio anyway, right?

00:07:04.762 --> 00:07:07.233
Just ask 'em all for
their numbers then.

00:07:08.603 --> 00:07:11.876
- But I need to call
her right away.

00:07:11.976 --> 00:07:14.147
- Why don't you just go
to her place and see her?

00:07:14.247 --> 00:07:16.986
Hachiko's got morning
sickness and it's raining.

00:07:17.086 --> 00:07:18.690
I'm sure she'll be home.

00:07:20.225 --> 00:07:22.263
- She's in Shirogane?

00:07:22.363 --> 00:07:23.933
302?

00:07:24.033 --> 00:07:26.539
That's the same number
as Ren's place.

00:07:29.745 --> 00:07:32.083
Ren, give me a ride
to the station.

00:07:32.183 --> 00:07:33.686
- The Shirogane Station?

00:07:33.786 --> 00:07:35.590
- No, the one close to here.

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:38.028
I've gotta buy those
glasses first.

00:07:38.128 --> 00:07:39.363
- Hmm.

00:07:39.464 --> 00:07:42.336
- [Nana] No matter how many
times I think it through,

00:07:42.436 --> 00:07:45.375
I can't get over how
careless I was.

00:07:45.476 --> 00:07:47.279
But it was raining like crazy,

00:07:47.379 --> 00:07:49.083
and I didn't have my umbrella.

00:07:49.183 --> 00:07:52.724
I can tell you a million other
excuses I've told myself.

00:07:52.824 --> 00:07:56.398
The truth is I just had
to see Hachi right then.

00:07:56.498 --> 00:07:59.538
(somber music)

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:04.313
(footsteps clacking)

00:08:05.917 --> 00:08:09.223
(camera clicking)

00:08:11.829 --> 00:08:15.703
(car engine rumbling)

00:08:15.804 --> 00:08:17.707
- [Cameraman] Oh,
that was lucky.

00:08:17.808 --> 00:08:19.611
Thank God for this rain.

00:08:21.782 --> 00:08:24.555
- [Nana] The trigger
that alters one's fate

00:08:25.322 --> 00:08:27.226
can be pulled in an instant.

00:08:37.213 --> 00:08:40.285
(phone beeping)

00:08:40.385 --> 00:08:43.258
- Good afternoon, Mrs.
Ichinose, are you going out?

00:08:43.358 --> 00:08:45.997
- Yes, would you be able to
call a taxi for me please?

00:08:46.097 --> 00:08:47.199
- [Concierge] Certainly, mam.

00:08:47.299 --> 00:08:47.801
Where to?

00:08:47.901 --> 00:08:50.940
- [Mrs. Ichinose] To
Shirogane Station.

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.143
(somber music)
(footsteps thumping)

00:08:52.243 --> 00:08:55.182
(rain pattering)

00:09:05.837 --> 00:09:07.206
- This sucks.

00:09:07.306 --> 00:09:08.408
I can't find it.

00:09:08.509 --> 00:09:10.012
It's supposed to be right around
here.

00:09:10.112 --> 00:09:12.918
Ren said it'd be 20
minutes from the station.

00:09:13.018 --> 00:09:15.723
It feels like it's been at least
an hour.

00:09:15.824 --> 00:09:18.161
Excuse me, I'm looking for this
address,

00:09:18.261 --> 00:09:20.432
do you happen to know where it
is?

00:09:20.533 --> 00:09:27.413
(car engine rumbling)

00:09:48.723 --> 00:09:52.029
(buttons beeping)

00:09:54.367 --> 00:09:59.410
I just have to act normal,
like nothing ever happened.

00:09:59.511 --> 00:10:03.285
Hachi thinks I've taken Nobu's
side and I'm mad at her.

00:10:04.788 --> 00:10:06.859
(sighs) That's because she
thinks of me

00:10:06.959 --> 00:10:10.199
as some kind of hero of justice.

00:10:10.299 --> 00:10:13.371
But the hero is always on
the side of the heroine

00:10:13.471 --> 00:10:15.175
no matter what.

00:10:15.275 --> 00:10:16.444
I'll show her that.

00:10:16.545 --> 00:10:19.217
(doorbell rings)

00:10:19.317 --> 00:10:20.887
Sorry, Nobu.

00:10:37.721 --> 00:10:41.194
(Paper rustling)

00:10:41.294 --> 00:10:43.866
Um, excuse me, the person
I came to see

00:10:43.966 --> 00:10:45.402
doesn't seem to be at home.

00:10:45.503 --> 00:10:48.475
When she comes back, can you
please give this to her for me?

00:10:48.576 --> 00:10:50.012
- Of course I can.

00:10:50.112 --> 00:10:52.584
And which suite number
is the package for, mam?

00:10:52.684 --> 00:10:54.387
- Suite 302.

00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:55.255
- Oh.

00:10:55.355 --> 00:10:56.057
- Huh?

00:10:56.157 --> 00:10:57.594
- I'm sorry, there's no one
living

00:10:57.694 --> 00:10:59.731
in suite 302 at the moment.

00:10:59.831 --> 00:11:02.036
Perhaps you have the
wrong number.

00:11:05.777 --> 00:11:07.279
(rain pattering)

00:11:07.379 --> 00:11:11.889
- [Nana] 302 is the same
number as Ren's place.

00:11:13.391 --> 00:11:16.197
There's no way I could
have gotten that wrong.

00:11:22.544 --> 00:11:24.447
(lighter clicks)

00:11:24.548 --> 00:11:25.382
- [Server] Excuse me?

00:11:25.482 --> 00:11:26.050
- Hmm.

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:28.321
- [Server] Smoking's not allowed
in here.

00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.897
(Shin sighs)

00:11:36.237 --> 00:11:38.643
- Uh. (giggles)

00:11:38.743 --> 00:11:40.312
- Nana Komatsu?

00:11:40.412 --> 00:11:42.182
I'm sorry, but there's no one
living

00:11:42.283 --> 00:11:43.485
in this building by that name.

00:11:43.586 --> 00:11:44.053
- That's impossible.

00:11:44.153 --> 00:11:46.291
She told me just the other
day that she moved in.

00:11:46.391 --> 00:11:48.796
Wait, it's probably under
Takumi's name.

00:11:48.896 --> 00:11:49.965
What's his last name?

00:11:50.065 --> 00:11:51.835
Is Takumi even his real name?

00:11:51.935 --> 00:11:54.173
How the hell should I
know Takumi's real name?

00:11:54.273 --> 00:11:57.179
Takumi from Trapnest and my
friend live in apartment 302.

00:11:57.279 --> 00:11:59.317
You don't have to lie about
it 'cause I already know.

00:11:59.417 --> 00:12:00.753
- [Concierge] There's no one
living here

00:12:00.853 --> 00:12:02.089
that goes by that name.

00:12:02.189 --> 00:12:05.429
I'm sorry, but I'm going to
have to ask you to leave.

00:12:06.565 --> 00:12:07.567
(rain pattering)

00:12:07.667 --> 00:12:09.103
- [Nana] Damn it.

00:12:09.203 --> 00:12:12.711
I bet that stupid concierge
thinks I'm a Takumi stalker.

00:12:12.811 --> 00:12:14.848
Of all people, Takumi.

00:12:16.184 --> 00:12:17.587
- [Concierge] I'm sorry,
there's no one living

00:12:17.687 --> 00:12:20.158
in suite 302 at the moment.

00:12:20.258 --> 00:12:20.960
- [Nana] Cutting everyone off

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:23.733
without letting them explain
anything.

00:12:23.833 --> 00:12:24.901
Leave it to Takumi to come up

00:12:25.002 --> 00:12:27.039
with that kind of way
to isolate her.

00:12:27.139 --> 00:12:29.778
Anyone who stops by will just
think they made a mistake

00:12:29.878 --> 00:12:32.851
with the address and walk away.

00:12:32.951 --> 00:12:35.288
Poor Hachi, she's stuck
here living in a place

00:12:35.389 --> 00:12:37.627
that's supposed to
be unoccupied.

00:12:37.727 --> 00:12:40.867
She's like a ghost who
doesn't realize she's dead.

00:12:40.967 --> 00:12:44.140
She exists only for Takumi
and her baby.

00:12:46.512 --> 00:12:50.953
Hachi, is that really how
you wanna live?

00:12:51.054 --> 00:12:53.425
- Seriously, you're getting
married?

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:54.728
- Mm-hmm.

00:12:54.828 --> 00:12:56.999
- So does that mean
you're pregnant?

00:12:57.099 --> 00:12:58.301
- Not hard to figure out, huh?

00:12:58.401 --> 00:13:00.272
- Well, that's just because
I can't think

00:13:00.372 --> 00:13:03.979
of any other reason why Takumi
would ask you to marry him.

00:13:04.881 --> 00:13:07.119
Are you sure it is Takumi's?

00:13:09.925 --> 00:13:11.260
- I think so.

00:13:13.031 --> 00:13:14.100
- Get an abortion.

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.037
Tell Takumi everything
that's happened

00:13:16.137 --> 00:13:17.507
and break up with him.

00:13:17.607 --> 00:13:19.343
It's not like you're
gonna magically be happy

00:13:19.443 --> 00:13:21.481
as soon as you get
married, you know?

00:13:21.582 --> 00:13:23.853
- Well, Takumi already
knows everything.

00:13:23.953 --> 00:13:26.357
- He knows and he still
wants to get married?

00:13:26.457 --> 00:13:27.092
I don't believe it!

00:13:27.192 --> 00:13:29.397
- Huh, but, well, we're
getting married

00:13:29.497 --> 00:13:33.539
'cause we both accept the
situation and each other.

00:13:35.041 --> 00:13:37.179
I'm totally weird, huh?

00:13:37.279 --> 00:13:39.518
Takumi's a pretty weird guy too.

00:13:40.987 --> 00:13:43.959
- Nah, obviously I'm not
someone who should judge

00:13:44.059 --> 00:13:46.832
what's weird or wrong
about anything.

00:13:46.932 --> 00:13:49.638
You probably shouldn't
listen to what I say.

00:13:52.342 --> 00:13:55.382
- Do you think maybe your
family situation

00:13:55.482 --> 00:13:58.522
is like the situation
I'm in now?

00:13:58.622 --> 00:14:00.058
Shin, everyone's been keeping

00:14:00.158 --> 00:14:02.664
this whole thing a
secret from you.

00:14:02.764 --> 00:14:03.799
And part of the reason

00:14:03.899 --> 00:14:06.070
is because they don't
wanna talk about me.

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:08.241
I also get the feeling
it's 'cause they're trying

00:14:08.341 --> 00:14:11.882
to avoid hitting a sore
spot for you.

00:14:11.982 --> 00:14:14.888
I was gonna keep it a
secret from you too.

00:14:14.988 --> 00:14:17.927
I knew you'd be against
me having the baby.

00:14:18.829 --> 00:14:19.564
But then I started thinking

00:14:19.664 --> 00:14:21.768
that is why I should
tell you the whole story.

00:14:21.869 --> 00:14:24.206
I sort of feel like I know
what your mother went through.

00:14:24.306 --> 00:14:26.545
It must have been really
difficult for her.

00:14:26.645 --> 00:14:28.983
But in the end, I believe
that she still wanted

00:14:29.083 --> 00:14:31.154
to have you, Shin.

00:14:31.254 --> 00:14:32.322
- I know that already.

00:14:32.422 --> 00:14:34.694
You don't need to talk
to me as if I'm a child.

00:14:34.795 --> 00:14:35.763
(bell rings)

00:14:35.863 --> 00:14:37.099
- Oh.

00:14:38.368 --> 00:14:40.405
Then, can you tell me something?

00:14:40.506 --> 00:14:42.744
I wanna know what it
was that made you feel

00:14:42.844 --> 00:14:46.785
like your mother should never
have given birth to you.

00:14:46.885 --> 00:14:49.223
Because I don't want my child

00:14:49.323 --> 00:14:51.995
ever believing something
like that.

00:14:52.095 --> 00:14:54.066
But if the baby isn't
really Takumi's,

00:14:54.166 --> 00:14:56.170
I think it'll hurt him
in some way.

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:58.408
And what if they don't
look the same?

00:14:58.509 --> 00:15:00.913
I bet at some point the
kid will think it's weird

00:15:01.013 --> 00:15:02.584
and get suspicious.

00:15:02.684 --> 00:15:04.788
But no matter what happens,
I have to hope

00:15:04.888 --> 00:15:07.694
that if we do our best to
try and make this work,

00:15:07.794 --> 00:15:12.302
we'll have a chance, a
chance to be a happy family.

00:15:12.402 --> 00:15:14.440
Is that wishful thinking?

00:15:14.541 --> 00:15:16.879
- Yeah, it is.

00:15:16.979 --> 00:15:20.485
But listen, you shouldn't care
about what I think anyway.

00:15:20.586 --> 00:15:22.991
Even if there are
some similarities,

00:15:23.091 --> 00:15:24.159
things will be different for you

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:25.696
'cause you're different people.

00:15:25.796 --> 00:15:28.769
You've gotta do whatever
you believe is right.

00:15:30.372 --> 00:15:32.577
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

00:15:36.652 --> 00:15:40.826
- The truth is I wish I'd been
born as your child, Hachi.

00:15:40.927 --> 00:15:43.699
(Hachi gasps)

00:15:46.939 --> 00:15:49.678
(Hachi sobs)

00:15:51.147 --> 00:15:54.955
- Shinichi Okazaki, his
mother committed suicide

00:15:55.055 --> 00:15:56.858
shortly after he was born.

00:15:56.959 --> 00:15:59.163
As for who his real father is,

00:15:59.263 --> 00:16:01.067
I don't think we'll ever know.

00:16:01.167 --> 00:16:03.104
If you want, I can dig
further into this,

00:16:03.204 --> 00:16:06.043
but since it happened
overseas, it'll be difficult,

00:16:06.143 --> 00:16:07.614
and it'll take a lot of time.

00:16:07.714 --> 00:16:10.118
- No, this is all I
need on this kid.

00:16:10.218 --> 00:16:11.320
What I want you to find out now

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:14.360
is what happened to
Nana Osaki's mother.

00:16:15.161 --> 00:16:17.099
- Thank you, I appreciate it.

00:16:17.199 --> 00:16:18.535
You know, this story is a waste

00:16:18.636 --> 00:16:21.541
unless Blast releases an
album on a major label.

00:16:21.642 --> 00:16:22.810
- Just wait and see.

00:16:22.911 --> 00:16:23.979
These kids are gonna be big.

00:16:24.079 --> 00:16:27.319
- But Gaia seems to be in
no hurry to make it happen.

00:16:27.419 --> 00:16:29.490
- That's why I'm gonna
make it happen.

00:16:29.591 --> 00:16:31.427
- Even if they put out
a debut single,

00:16:31.528 --> 00:16:32.162
it won't sell.

00:16:32.262 --> 00:16:33.231
I mean, if their image is good,

00:16:33.331 --> 00:16:34.333
they'll attract the idiot fans,

00:16:34.433 --> 00:16:36.705
but the real music
fans will hate them.

00:16:36.805 --> 00:16:37.472
Anyway, they're-

00:16:37.573 --> 00:16:38.241
- Shut up!

00:16:38.341 --> 00:16:39.276
You think you're a music critic?

00:16:39.376 --> 00:16:42.149
The truth is what the people
want has never changed.

00:16:42.249 --> 00:16:43.852
They want a juicy story.

00:16:43.953 --> 00:16:46.858
We got stupid kids nowadays
deluding themselves

00:16:46.959 --> 00:16:48.596
into thinking they're
great artists.

00:16:48.696 --> 00:16:49.864
It makes me sick.

00:16:49.965 --> 00:16:51.568
And let me tell you,
a world ruled

00:16:51.668 --> 00:16:54.139
by a goody-goody honor
roll band like Trapnest

00:16:54.239 --> 00:16:55.543
is one big yawn.

00:16:55.643 --> 00:16:59.818
I just wanna smash that
idiot Takumi's face in.

00:16:59.918 --> 00:17:03.157
Anyway, I'm looking forward
to tomorrow's media circus.

00:17:03.257 --> 00:17:04.761
We're gonna open
everyone's eyes.

00:17:04.861 --> 00:17:07.399
- But the next search issue
comes out in a couple of days.

00:17:07.499 --> 00:17:09.604
- I sold half the story
to a TV station.

00:17:09.704 --> 00:17:11.340
They were drooling
over my scenario

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:13.277
and practically handed over
their wallets.

00:17:13.378 --> 00:17:15.382
- So all this was
just to line your own pockets?

00:17:15.482 --> 00:17:18.221
- I'm just trying to
boost business and sell
more magazines.

00:17:18.321 --> 00:17:19.958
After the world's been glued to
the TVs

00:17:20.058 --> 00:17:20.860
watching this love story break,

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:23.532
they're gonna jump all
over our exclusive photos.

00:17:23.632 --> 00:17:26.103
- [Man] Huh, you got
them together?

00:17:28.074 --> 00:17:29.878
- You better believe it.

00:17:35.188 --> 00:17:37.694
- [Nana] I waited for Hachi
in front of her new building

00:17:37.794 --> 00:17:39.363
until the sun went down,

00:17:40.332 --> 00:17:41.902
but I never saw her.

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:44.406
(button beeping)

00:17:44.507 --> 00:17:46.778
I'll come back tomorrow
after work.

00:17:48.381 --> 00:17:50.385
I've got a little time before
practice.

00:17:50.485 --> 00:17:51.521
I'll get her number from Yasu

00:17:51.621 --> 00:17:55.395
so we don't miss each
other like this again.

00:17:55.495 --> 00:17:58.869
It's not like I'll never see
her for the rest of my life.

00:18:00.138 --> 00:18:02.309
There's always tomorrow.

00:18:02.409 --> 00:18:03.746
- [Hachi] Sorry I talked your
ears off,

00:18:03.846 --> 00:18:06.918
but I'm glad we got to
talk about things.

00:18:07.019 --> 00:18:09.924
- In my experience, housewives
are always desperate

00:18:10.025 --> 00:18:10.726
for someone to talk to.

00:18:10.826 --> 00:18:13.431
Don't isolate yourself at
home thinking about your baby.

00:18:13.532 --> 00:18:15.836
You gotta get out and do
things, you know?

00:18:15.936 --> 00:18:18.041
- Now that I think about
it, you're right.

00:18:18.141 --> 00:18:19.978
The only time I go out
is for groceries

00:18:20.078 --> 00:18:21.313
or my doctor appointments.

00:18:21.414 --> 00:18:23.217
- Why don't you take a
class or something?

00:18:23.317 --> 00:18:24.286
You might make some new friends.

00:18:24.386 --> 00:18:25.455
- Great idea!

00:18:25.556 --> 00:18:27.927
Well then, good luck
at practice, Shin.

00:18:28.027 --> 00:18:29.396
- It's not that important.

00:18:29.496 --> 00:18:32.169
Some things are just impossible,
no matter what you do.

00:18:32.269 --> 00:18:33.337
- Hey, don't talk like that.

00:18:33.438 --> 00:18:35.876
I know that someday
Blast is gonna rule Japan

00:18:35.976 --> 00:18:37.112
and then the whole world!

00:18:37.212 --> 00:18:39.183
- Hmm.

00:18:39.283 --> 00:18:41.053
Well then, Madam, let's meet
again

00:18:41.153 --> 00:18:42.924
when your husband's not around.

00:18:43.726 --> 00:18:44.861
- Uh, yeah.

00:19:00.225 --> 00:19:03.064
- (gasps) Hey, Shin?

00:19:03.164 --> 00:19:04.199
- Huh?

00:19:04.299 --> 00:19:07.439
(brooding music)

00:19:11.515 --> 00:19:13.552
- How's Nobu doing?

00:19:14.119 --> 00:19:15.355
- Huh?

00:19:19.764 --> 00:19:21.535
He just plays guitar all the
time.

00:19:21.635 --> 00:19:24.473
Sometimes it's so loud
I can't even sleep.

00:19:31.555 --> 00:19:33.926
- [Nana] I can't wait for
tomorrow.

00:19:35.596 --> 00:19:37.466
I hope it's a sunny day.

00:19:39.904 --> 00:19:42.777
(clock ringing)

00:19:44.446 --> 00:19:45.248
(footstep thumping)

00:19:45.348 --> 00:19:46.117
- Ow!

00:19:46.217 --> 00:19:47.820
- Oh, sorry, I didn't see you.

00:19:50.458 --> 00:19:54.901
- (grunts) Seven o'clock?

00:19:55.001 --> 00:19:58.374
He just went to bed, and now
he's getting up for work?

00:19:58.474 --> 00:20:00.178
How does he do it?

00:20:00.278 --> 00:20:03.384
(lighter clicks)

00:20:15.609 --> 00:20:17.345
- I can't believe you're
watching your own video

00:20:17.445 --> 00:20:18.782
first thing in the morning.

00:20:18.882 --> 00:20:22.355
- No, it's not a video,
we're on TV.

00:20:22.455 --> 00:20:23.491
- Yeah, right.

00:20:23.592 --> 00:20:24.694
- This is channel seven.

00:20:24.794 --> 00:20:28.434
- That channel has a morning
show on this time of day.

00:20:28.535 --> 00:20:29.671
- [Announcer] Good morning!

00:20:29.771 --> 00:20:31.273
Welcome to Seven in the Morning.

00:20:31.373 --> 00:20:32.710
The big buzz is that Ren Honjo,

00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:35.716
guitarist of Trapnest,
has a girlfriend.

00:20:35.816 --> 00:20:36.518
Sorry, ladies.

00:20:36.618 --> 00:20:38.856
She's a singer in Ren's
former band, Blast,

00:20:38.956 --> 00:20:40.826
who'll be releasing
their debut single

00:20:40.926 --> 00:20:42.295
with Gaia sometime soon.

00:20:42.395 --> 00:20:45.769
(foreboding music)

00:20:49.878 --> 00:20:52.449
- [Nana] From that day
on, when the sky cleared,

00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:56.090
and the spotlight was
suddenly pointing at us,

00:20:56.190 --> 00:21:01.066
we found ourselves standing
not on a stage, but in a ring.

00:21:05.041 --> 00:21:09.751
I can still hear the cheers
and jeers ringing in my head,

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:12.857
loud and annoying.
