WEBVTT

00:00:01.369 --> 00:00:02.137
(airplane engine roaring)

00:00:02.732 --> 00:00:06.171
- [Woman] Every day was
jam packed with band stuff.

00:00:06.271 --> 00:00:08.810
I barely had time to sleep.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.647
I certainly didn't have the
energy

00:00:10.748 --> 00:00:13.219
to realize the fatal
flaw in my plan.

00:00:13.319 --> 00:00:16.258
(exciting music)

00:01:54.622 --> 00:01:58.028
(announcer speaking faintly)

00:01:58.129 --> 00:02:00.968
- So what do you guys
wanna do when we get there?

00:02:01.068 --> 00:02:02.838
- We've gotta go to a
real Italian restaurant.

00:02:02.938 --> 00:02:04.675
- Forget about the food.
What about shopping?

00:02:04.775 --> 00:02:05.276
I hear this store...

00:02:05.376 --> 00:02:06.679
- I think I just saw a guy from
Trapnest.

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:07.648
- What? Which one?
- Ren?

00:02:07.748 --> 00:02:08.683
- The guy with long hair.
- Really?

00:02:08.783 --> 00:02:10.988
- Where?
- So where's Ren?

00:02:11.088 --> 00:02:13.359
(birds chirping)

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.699
- I'm sick of eating bread
for breakfast every day.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.135
I gotta get some miso soup.

00:02:18.235 --> 00:02:21.208
- Really? 'Cause I found this
great Japanese restaurant.

00:02:21.308 --> 00:02:21.810
You want to go tonight?

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.880
- No, I want some salty
miso soup,

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.249
the kind that Nana makes.

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:26.519
- Put your voice down, please.

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:30.828
- Ren, you're better off
forgetting about women like
that.

00:02:30.928 --> 00:02:31.930
- Women like what?

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.502
- Well, since you brought it
up, I gotta be honest with you.

00:02:34.602 --> 00:02:35.938
The truth is, Nana is bad news.

00:02:36.038 --> 00:02:39.010
She's taking advantage of you
and if she really loved you

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.248
then she would care more
about the sodium content

00:02:41.348 --> 00:02:42.183
of the food she cooks.

00:02:42.283 --> 00:02:42.483
- Listen, Take,

00:02:42.585 --> 00:02:44.956
you have to let me go
back to Japan right away.

00:02:45.056 --> 00:02:46.225
It's not cool that Takumi got to
go.

00:02:46.325 --> 00:02:48.162
- Sorry, you still
have the photo shoot to do

00:02:48.262 --> 00:02:50.501
Besides, Takumi had his
reasons for leaving early.

00:02:50.601 --> 00:02:52.003
- Huh? Wait a second.

00:02:52.103 --> 00:02:53.940
Takumi is going home before us?

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.777
- He left yesterday by himself.

00:02:55.878 --> 00:02:56.746
- What the hell?

00:02:56.846 --> 00:02:58.850
Why didn't he tell us
this before he left?

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.554
- He must have already landed
by now.

00:03:00.654 --> 00:03:02.390
- He sucks, man.

00:03:03.527 --> 00:03:04.394
(crickets chirping)

00:03:04.494 --> 00:03:07.601
- Okay, mom, I'm gonna go
check in at the hotel now.

00:03:07.701 --> 00:03:10.273
- But if Takumi is coming
over to visit us tomorrow,

00:03:10.373 --> 00:03:12.845
I don't see why he doesn't
just stay here tonight.

00:03:12.945 --> 00:03:14.815
- Well, it's because he's
getting in pretty late

00:03:14.916 --> 00:03:17.020
so he didn't wanna
bother anyone.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.457
- He doesn't need to worry
about that kind of stuff,

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:20.627
he's practically family now.

00:03:20.727 --> 00:03:23.232
- Mom, they haven't seen
each other for two weeks.

00:03:23.332 --> 00:03:25.236
I'm sure they have
some catching up to do.

00:03:25.336 --> 00:03:25.904
- Oh, of course.

00:03:26.004 --> 00:03:27.440
That makes sense.

00:03:27.541 --> 00:03:28.677
(engine roaring)

00:03:28.777 --> 00:03:30.246
- I'm looking forward
to tomorrow.

00:03:30.346 --> 00:03:31.783
When I was talking with
Takumi me on the phone

00:03:31.883 --> 00:03:33.419
he seemed like
a really nice guy.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.989
- When did you talk to him?

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:36.793
- Oh, when he called the
other day from London

00:03:36.893 --> 00:03:38.830
I was the one who
answered the phone.

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.001
Dad's always saying that
celebrities are as bad

00:03:41.101 --> 00:03:43.138
as the Yakuza, but he
was really impressed

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.478
by how polite and
respectful Takumi was.

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:49.518
- Is that so, sometimes he
acts like he's in the Yakuza.

00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:50.687
- (chuckles) Oh really?

00:03:50.787 --> 00:03:53.627
- If he actually was a gangster,
he'd take over the world.

00:03:53.727 --> 00:03:54.996
He's so cutthroat.

00:03:55.096 --> 00:03:57.367
- Well then maybe God
gave him musical talent

00:03:57.467 --> 00:03:59.170
so he would stay on
the right path in life,

00:03:59.271 --> 00:04:02.277
instead of using his
energy for evil.

00:04:02.377 --> 00:04:05.216
The entertainment world
seems flashy and exciting

00:04:05.316 --> 00:04:07.888
but I bet it's also
really stressful.

00:04:07.988 --> 00:04:09.057
I'm sure he needs you,

00:04:09.157 --> 00:04:11.863
his family, as a refuge
where he can relax.

00:04:11.963 --> 00:04:13.198
That's an important role.

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:16.906
You should pour all your
heart into it. (sighs)

00:04:17.006 --> 00:04:19.444
- By the way, how's Nana
been doing?

00:04:19.545 --> 00:04:20.881
Have you kept in touch with her?

00:04:20.981 --> 00:04:21.582
- Not really.

00:04:21.683 --> 00:04:25.289
I heard that she broke her
cell phone or something.

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:26.726
So I haven't been
able to call her

00:04:26.826 --> 00:04:30.232
or send her a text message
and she hasn't called me either.

00:04:30.333 --> 00:04:31.569
- Oh, that's too bad.

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:33.540
You two were really close.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.911
- But I heard from other friends
that she's doing all right

00:04:36.011 --> 00:04:38.583
and really giving it
everything she's got.

00:04:38.683 --> 00:04:39.685
- Everything she's got?

00:04:39.785 --> 00:04:41.455
- That's my Nana for you.

00:04:41.556 --> 00:04:43.492
- She's one tough cookie, huh?

00:04:45.564 --> 00:04:48.903
I was so frantic to give
Hachi the chance to see me

00:04:49.004 --> 00:04:52.043
out there singing. (sighs)

00:04:53.312 --> 00:04:57.453
I never thought to ask
her how she was doing.

00:04:57.554 --> 00:05:02.430
I honestly didn't wanna hear
about her baby or Takumi.

00:05:02.531 --> 00:05:06.405
But I know that was just
me being jealous.

00:05:06.506 --> 00:05:09.477
- Reira, you haven't even
touched any of your breakfast

00:05:09.578 --> 00:05:10.346
this morning.

00:05:10.446 --> 00:05:11.582
Are you feeling okay?

00:05:11.683 --> 00:05:12.383
- I'm alright.

00:05:12.483 --> 00:05:15.456
Hey Mari, do you think that
Takumi hooked up with Stella

00:05:15.557 --> 00:05:16.592
when he was here?

00:05:16.693 --> 00:05:19.230
- What? How should I know?

00:05:20.701 --> 00:05:21.401
We've been so busy.

00:05:21.502 --> 00:05:23.840
I don't think he had time to
sleep around.

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.343
Besides he changed his schedule

00:05:25.443 --> 00:05:27.480
because he wanted to
get back to his fiance.

00:05:27.581 --> 00:05:29.819
- That's not cool.
- Huh?

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:31.021
- I mean, of course it's so fine

00:05:31.121 --> 00:05:33.760
and good for his fiance
that he decided to go back.

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.062
But Stella's been in love with
him

00:05:35.162 --> 00:05:37.000
for a lot longer, you know?

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.337
- Oh, is that so?

00:05:39.437 --> 00:05:42.544
- I bet she was even secretly
dreaming of marrying Takumi

00:05:42.644 --> 00:05:44.582
someday when the time was right.

00:05:44.682 --> 00:05:46.552
I feel kind of sorry for her.

00:05:50.761 --> 00:05:54.467
(computer chimes)

00:05:54.568 --> 00:05:56.204
- You really are amazing, Reira.

00:05:56.304 --> 00:05:57.240
- What?

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:58.743
- You're able to see the world

00:05:58.843 --> 00:06:00.714
from other people's
point of view.

00:06:00.814 --> 00:06:01.348
- But not me.

00:06:01.448 --> 00:06:04.454
I was only thinking about
Takumi's fiance's feelings.

00:06:04.555 --> 00:06:07.060
- I guess someone who can
sing songs that captivate

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.634
millions has a special
take on life.

00:06:10.734 --> 00:06:12.671
- I think you're
overestimating me.

00:06:12.771 --> 00:06:13.506
- Huh?

00:06:13.606 --> 00:06:16.846
- I don't have any amazing
abilities or insights.

00:06:16.946 --> 00:06:19.250
It's just who and what
I can relate to.

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:23.058
I'm just a regular person who
can only think about herself.

00:06:23.158 --> 00:06:26.431
I have no idea what
Stella is really thinking.

00:06:31.174 --> 00:06:33.546
- [Man] Hi, Reira,
how's it going?

00:06:33.646 --> 00:06:36.552
Have you been able to relax
a little in London town?

00:06:36.652 --> 00:06:39.925
Right now, I'm recording at a
training camp in the mountain

00:06:40.025 --> 00:06:41.328
somewhere up north.

00:06:41.428 --> 00:06:44.234
The recording part has been
really cool

00:06:44.334 --> 00:06:48.175
but they have us on this
crazy exercise program.

00:06:48.275 --> 00:06:51.314
I don't really get why
they're making us do all this.

00:06:51.415 --> 00:06:54.254
Seeing Yasu in a
sweatsuit is funny though.

00:06:54.354 --> 00:06:58.362
Ah, but after being on a regular
schedule for five days now,

00:06:58.462 --> 00:06:59.397
I feel good.

00:06:59.497 --> 00:07:01.702
I think I've even grown
a little taller.

00:07:01.803 --> 00:07:03.540
Maybe I'm just imagining it.

00:07:05.009 --> 00:07:07.480
- (slurps) It's salty!

00:07:07.581 --> 00:07:08.616
- Huh?

00:07:08.716 --> 00:07:10.620
You're the one who said
you wanted miso soup.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.423
So just shut up and eat it.

00:07:13.626 --> 00:07:14.260
- I don't get it.

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.566
Why do you always have
to put so much salt

00:07:16.666 --> 00:07:17.400
in everything you cook?

00:07:17.501 --> 00:07:19.605
Misato, should have come
with us to this weird camp

00:07:19.705 --> 00:07:22.376
and she could have been the
one to cook all our meals

00:07:22.477 --> 00:07:22.711
for us.

00:07:22.811 --> 00:07:25.149
- No, I think that would
be asking too much of her.

00:07:25.249 --> 00:07:26.686
- Well, I think she
should just go ahead

00:07:26.786 --> 00:07:29.390
and quit school and become
a full-time manager.

00:07:29.491 --> 00:07:30.059
- Great idea!

00:07:30.159 --> 00:07:31.596
- She is responsible.

00:07:31.696 --> 00:07:32.931
- That's a good point.

00:07:33.031 --> 00:07:34.400
I'd much rather have cute Misato

00:07:34.502 --> 00:07:35.637
as our manager than that
guy we have now.

00:07:35.737 --> 00:07:39.645
- Yasu! Is there something
wrong with me?

00:07:39.745 --> 00:07:42.383
- [All] Everything
is wrong with you.

00:07:43.586 --> 00:07:46.091
- What did you say?

00:07:46.191 --> 00:07:48.428
- Ginpei, you're a man,
so talk like one.

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:49.698
And do you really think we need
more

00:07:49.799 --> 00:07:51.969
than one baldy around here?

00:07:52.069 --> 00:07:53.071
- You're one to talk.

00:07:53.172 --> 00:07:55.309
You're a girl so why
don't you talk like one.

00:07:55.409 --> 00:07:58.248
And FYI, I'm not bald, I
just like shaving my head.

00:07:58.348 --> 00:08:00.019
- Hey, it's not like
I'm bald either,

00:08:00.119 --> 00:08:01.656
I shaved my head too.

00:08:01.756 --> 00:08:03.192
(man chuckles)

00:08:03.292 --> 00:08:04.995
- It smells good in here.

00:08:05.095 --> 00:08:06.498
- Oh! Hi Matsuo.

00:08:06.599 --> 00:08:09.103
Have you had dinner yet?
Do you wanna join us?

00:08:09.204 --> 00:08:10.406
- No. Thanks.

00:08:10.507 --> 00:08:11.107
- Eat it.

00:08:11.208 --> 00:08:12.043
- I eat with the other staff

00:08:12.143 --> 00:08:13.580
whenever it's your turn
to cook, Nana.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.784
- And that's exactly why your
wife decided

00:08:15.884 --> 00:08:17.286
to leave you, Matsuo.

00:08:17.386 --> 00:08:19.925
- Anyway, Mr. Kawano should
be getting here soon.

00:08:20.025 --> 00:08:21.863
So tonight we're gonna skip
practice

00:08:21.963 --> 00:08:22.764
and have a meeting instead.

00:08:22.865 --> 00:08:25.102
When you're finished
with this delicious meal,

00:08:25.202 --> 00:08:27.173
come to the conference room in
the studio.

00:08:27.273 --> 00:08:28.175
- God, It's freezing.

00:08:28.275 --> 00:08:29.578
What's wrong with this place?

00:08:29.678 --> 00:08:30.547
- Yeah, it's crazy.

00:08:30.647 --> 00:08:31.414
Is still September.

00:08:31.516 --> 00:08:33.352
- [Man] Whatever happened
to global warming?

00:08:33.452 --> 00:08:34.555
- [Man] What's global warming?

00:08:34.655 --> 00:08:36.424
- [Man] Read a newspaper
sometime.

00:08:36.526 --> 00:08:39.364
- Gaia owns this camp and
it's really nice

00:08:39.464 --> 00:08:42.571
but we're surrounded by woods
out in the middle of nowhere.

00:08:42.671 --> 00:08:46.311
It's kind of a drag, but
the media can't find us

00:08:46.411 --> 00:08:50.019
and it's better than hiding out
in some hotel room in Tokyo.

00:08:51.221 --> 00:08:53.358
The air's so fresh
and clean here

00:08:53.458 --> 00:08:55.897
and you can see lots of
stars at night.

00:08:55.997 --> 00:08:59.772
For some reason, whenever I
something that's sparkling,

00:08:59.872 --> 00:09:02.009
makes me think of you.

00:09:02.109 --> 00:09:06.284
I wonder why.
I really don't know.

00:09:06.384 --> 00:09:08.155
- You want us to do
unannounced shows?

00:09:08.255 --> 00:09:10.660
- That's right, at five
different locations

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:11.862
starting on the 10th.

00:09:11.963 --> 00:09:14.602
Shinjuku, Yoyogi,
Ikebukuro, Ueno

00:09:14.702 --> 00:09:17.473
and Shibuya will be
setting up special stages

00:09:17.574 --> 00:09:20.012
where there's sure to
be a lot of foot track.

00:09:20.112 --> 00:09:21.515
- Yay, we're gonna play
live shows.

00:09:21.616 --> 00:09:24.153
- Won't we get in trouble
with the police?

00:09:24.254 --> 00:09:26.559
- No, we've already obtained
legal permits

00:09:26.659 --> 00:09:27.293
for all the locations.

00:09:27.393 --> 00:09:29.163
We're just not going to tell
the public

00:09:29.264 --> 00:09:30.499
that we're having them.

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.069
- Good, because I'm
sure you're sick

00:09:32.169 --> 00:09:34.875
of dealing with the cops.

00:09:34.975 --> 00:09:37.681
- So the audience will be
just whoever's passing by,

00:09:37.781 --> 00:09:39.818
but we'll hire about 20
part-time actors

00:09:39.919 --> 00:09:40.486
to clap and cheer for you.

00:09:40.587 --> 00:09:42.591
- We don't need you to
hire actors.

00:09:42.691 --> 00:09:44.427
- Ooh, hiring actors is
a good idea.

00:09:44.528 --> 00:09:46.666
It's hard to get Japanese
crowds fired up.

00:09:46.766 --> 00:09:47.734
- You shut the hell up.

00:09:47.834 --> 00:09:51.441
- Just think of them as barkers
for when a new store opens.

00:09:51.542 --> 00:09:53.045
It's a way of drawing customers.

00:09:53.145 --> 00:09:53.579
- Hmm.

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:57.621
- So you'll sit there and
listen to Yasu when he talks.

00:09:57.721 --> 00:09:58.121
Hold on.

00:09:58.221 --> 00:10:00.092
You're not sleeping with him,
are you?

00:10:00.192 --> 00:10:01.361
- I'm gonna kick your ass.

00:10:01.461 --> 00:10:02.931
- Yippie. Try me, Girly.

00:10:03.031 --> 00:10:04.935
- Holy cracking bay.
You're huge!

00:10:05.035 --> 00:10:07.273
- As long as we
understand each other.

00:10:07.373 --> 00:10:09.612
- [Shin] By the way,
you might not know this

00:10:09.712 --> 00:10:10.780
because you're overseas,

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:14.220
but the gossip brags have
gotten even more insane.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:17.493
They're even gossiping
about Yasu now.

00:10:17.594 --> 00:10:19.898
They're digging up every
bit of his past,

00:10:19.999 --> 00:10:21.502
just like they did with Nana.

00:10:21.602 --> 00:10:23.271
They're making him out to
be a total thug

00:10:23.372 --> 00:10:24.975
based on his looks.

00:10:25.075 --> 00:10:26.177
I don't think they'd say
that now

00:10:26.277 --> 00:10:28.683
if they saw him in
his PE uniform.

00:10:29.885 --> 00:10:32.023
I don't know if it's
because they don't know

00:10:32.123 --> 00:10:34.360
or if they're purposely
hiding it for later,

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:36.899
but they haven't said anything
about you and Yasu yet.

00:10:36.999 --> 00:10:39.705
So you don't have to
worry, okay?

00:10:39.805 --> 00:10:43.211
(keyboard clicking)

00:10:53.165 --> 00:10:55.369
- Hey Ren, did Naoki tell you
about Yasu?

00:10:55.469 --> 00:10:56.672
- What's Baldy up to now?

00:10:56.772 --> 00:10:59.712
- Search magazine just wrote
a juicy article about him.

00:10:59.812 --> 00:11:02.851
Now, he says there are rumors
flying all over the internet.

00:11:02.951 --> 00:11:03.920
- An article about what?

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:07.293
- You know, stuff like,
apparently he punched a search

00:11:07.393 --> 00:11:08.495
reporter who was harassing Nana

00:11:08.596 --> 00:11:11.234
and cops took him in for
questioning and everything.

00:11:11.334 --> 00:11:13.506
So now all the other magazines
caught onto the story

00:11:13.606 --> 00:11:16.311
and they're saying Nana is
actually going out with Yasu

00:11:16.411 --> 00:11:18.616
and crazy things like that.

00:11:20.285 --> 00:11:22.189
That's just not possible, is it?

00:11:22.289 --> 00:11:24.862
It's all just lies.

00:11:24.962 --> 00:11:27.433
They also wrote that
Yasu didn't pass the bar.

00:11:27.534 --> 00:11:29.237
So he isn't actually a lawyer.

00:11:29.337 --> 00:11:31.107
Don't you think
that's just mean?

00:11:31.207 --> 00:11:32.878
- It totally sucks.

00:11:32.978 --> 00:11:34.447
- Uh, excuse me, Reira.

00:11:34.548 --> 00:11:35.416
- Oh, thanks Mary.

00:11:35.517 --> 00:11:37.420
- I've been hearing the
rumors that are going around

00:11:37.521 --> 00:11:39.858
and they've got me
worried about something.

00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:40.527
- Huh?

00:11:40.627 --> 00:11:43.098
- I mean, what if Yasu
isn't actually clerking

00:11:43.198 --> 00:11:44.968
at a law firm?

00:11:45.069 --> 00:11:46.071
- What's clerking?

00:11:46.171 --> 00:11:47.006
I've never heard of that before.

00:11:47.106 --> 00:11:50.279
- I guess it's kind of like
being a medical intern.

00:11:50.379 --> 00:11:51.949
After passing the bar exam,

00:11:52.049 --> 00:11:52.884
you have to work as a law clerk

00:11:52.984 --> 00:11:55.590
for a year and a half in
order to officially become

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:57.226
a lawyer.

00:11:57.326 --> 00:11:58.395
- You really know a lot.

00:11:58.495 --> 00:12:00.232
- More like you don't know
anything.

00:12:00.332 --> 00:12:01.267
- Oh, and you do?

00:12:01.367 --> 00:12:03.071
- Well, it's not exactly common
knowledge.

00:12:03.171 --> 00:12:06.579
I mean, I only know it because
I graduated from law school.

00:12:06.679 --> 00:12:07.814
(both gasps)

00:12:07.914 --> 00:12:08.783
- That is incredible.

00:12:08.883 --> 00:12:11.221
Now I understand why
you wear those glasses.

00:12:11.321 --> 00:12:12.123
- It's really no big deal.

00:12:12.223 --> 00:12:14.227
And I wear these glasses
because they're in fashion.

00:12:14.327 --> 00:12:16.866
- What are you doing
babysitting Reira?

00:12:16.966 --> 00:12:18.068
- What do you mean, babysitting?

00:12:18.168 --> 00:12:20.172
- You know like changing
your diapers.

00:12:20.272 --> 00:12:21.207
- I don't wear diapers.

00:12:21.307 --> 00:12:22.944
- All right, that's
enough about me.

00:12:23.044 --> 00:12:25.282
- No.
- Hmm?

00:12:25.382 --> 00:12:28.388
- I wanna know all there
is to know about you Mari.

00:12:28.488 --> 00:12:28.890
Are you free later tonight?

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:31.796
- How did I get stuck in a
band with guys who hit on

00:12:31.896 --> 00:12:32.898
every girl they see?

00:12:32.998 --> 00:12:34.167
You're pigs.

00:12:34.267 --> 00:12:37.774
- Anyway, now I know why he
also said he was a lawyer

00:12:37.874 --> 00:12:38.810
in training.

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:40.446
That must mean he's still in the
middle of

00:12:40.547 --> 00:12:40.980
the clerking thing.

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.519
- But it's been a year and
a half since he graduated.

00:12:43.619 --> 00:12:44.988
So maybe he's already
a real lawyer.

00:12:45.088 --> 00:12:47.561
Well, the thing is, once
you get yourself assigned

00:12:47.661 --> 00:12:50.165
to a clerkship, you have to
stick with the same place.

00:12:50.265 --> 00:12:52.236
So if he wanted to
devote all of his

00:12:52.336 --> 00:12:53.539
energy to his band then,

00:12:53.639 --> 00:12:57.012
I don't see how he could be
doing both at the same time.

00:12:57.113 --> 00:12:59.785
The firm he's been working
for probably hired him

00:12:59.885 --> 00:13:01.822
because they saw he
had a legal background,

00:13:01.922 --> 00:13:03.425
but all they would
have him doing

00:13:03.526 --> 00:13:05.195
is administrative type stuff.

00:13:05.295 --> 00:13:08.769
- [Man] Mary, come here!
- Okay.

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:11.876
I bet Yasu didn't wanna give
up his dream with the band.

00:13:11.976 --> 00:13:14.380
Hitting that reporter
proved that he cares more

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.217
for his band mates than the law.

00:13:16.317 --> 00:13:17.486
No matter what people say,

00:13:17.587 --> 00:13:20.225
I think your boyfriend
is a great person, Reira.

00:13:20.325 --> 00:13:23.733
Don't pay attention to the
rumors and try to stay positive.

00:13:23.833 --> 00:13:26.739
- [Man] Mary!
- [Mary] Yeah, coming.

00:13:26.839 --> 00:13:28.709
- My boyfriend?

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:30.647
Wasn't Yasu's dream to be a
lawyer

00:13:30.747 --> 00:13:32.784
instead of playing in a band?

00:13:36.859 --> 00:13:39.631
It's always been secrets
and lies with him.

00:13:39.731 --> 00:13:41.569
I could never figure
out what he was thinking

00:13:41.669 --> 00:13:43.973
or what he wanted in life.

00:13:44.073 --> 00:13:46.477
- I don't plan on making
a living playing music

00:13:46.579 --> 00:13:48.783
and I don't plan on
leaving this town either.

00:13:48.883 --> 00:13:51.622
So I guess there's
nothing we can do.

00:13:52.858 --> 00:13:55.429
- If his band was really
that important to him,

00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:58.836
was he just making an
excuse to break up with me?

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:02.944
- No, he wasn't putting
his band first

00:14:03.044 --> 00:14:05.717
when he made the decision
to let you go.

00:14:06.519 --> 00:14:08.890
Damn, it's messed up.

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:12.029
I can't stick my neck out
there like that for Nana.

00:14:12.129 --> 00:14:13.498
Not anymore.

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:17.641
I don't really know why that is.

00:14:17.741 --> 00:14:21.114
I still love her just as
much as I always have.

00:14:21.214 --> 00:14:26.859
- Hey, Ren, tell me, if I
died, would you die with me?

00:14:30.199 --> 00:14:33.706
- How, how did I get so
cold and numb?

00:14:39.083 --> 00:14:43.158
- [Shin] Hey, Reira, if
you told me you're lonely,

00:14:43.258 --> 00:14:45.495
I'd fly to London in a heartbeat

00:14:45.597 --> 00:14:48.301
or anywhere else in the world.

00:14:48.401 --> 00:14:51.441
If it'll warm your
heart and make you cozy,

00:14:51.542 --> 00:14:53.779
you better believe
I'll be there.

00:14:55.683 --> 00:14:59.123
It's not that I'm trying
to be the nice guy.

00:14:59.223 --> 00:15:01.729
It's just that, there's
nothing else as important

00:15:01.829 --> 00:15:03.799
to me as you are right now.

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:05.469
(upbeat music)

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:08.475
I don't know what the future
will bring,

00:15:08.576 --> 00:15:10.012
but I just wanted to say, I'm
sorry

00:15:10.112 --> 00:15:12.851
I've been so self-centered up
until now.

00:15:19.698 --> 00:15:23.238
- Listen, Ren, those feelings
don't make you a cold person.

00:15:23.338 --> 00:15:25.810
It's just that the longer
we go through life,

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:28.950
the heavier all the
baggage we have becomes.

00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:31.789
And it gets harder just
to do what you want.

00:15:31.889 --> 00:15:34.093
That's why you need someone else

00:15:34.193 --> 00:15:36.130
to carry that load with you.

00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:41.508
Don't you think you and your
girlfriend could do that

00:15:41.609 --> 00:15:42.811
for each other?

00:15:48.723 --> 00:15:52.396
(doorbell chimes)

00:15:52.496 --> 00:15:54.367
(door clicks)

00:15:54.467 --> 00:15:58.274
(suspenseful music)

00:15:58.375 --> 00:15:59.310
- Welcome home, darling.

00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:00.479
You must be tired from the trip.

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:02.550
- Entirely exhausted.

00:16:09.497 --> 00:16:10.767
Souvenirs.

00:16:10.867 --> 00:16:13.606
- There's so many.(chuckles)

00:16:13.706 --> 00:16:14.407
- Which one do you want?

00:16:14.508 --> 00:16:16.444
- I only get one?

00:16:17.647 --> 00:16:19.150
How about this one?

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:20.118
- Wow. You've got a great nose.

00:16:20.218 --> 00:16:23.158
You sniffed out the
diamond earrings.

00:16:23.258 --> 00:16:24.193
Go ahead. Open it.

00:16:24.293 --> 00:16:25.329
- No, I'll take this one.

00:16:25.429 --> 00:16:26.397
- That is English breakfast tea.

00:16:26.497 --> 00:16:27.399
- What about this one?

00:16:27.499 --> 00:16:28.869
- That one is a Pearl necklace.

00:16:28.969 --> 00:16:33.913
A watch. Shoes. A purse.
A cashmere sweater.

00:16:35.516 --> 00:16:36.417
- Where's my ring?

00:16:36.518 --> 00:16:38.589
- I can't believe you'd
think that's a souvenir.

00:16:38.689 --> 00:16:39.791
Besides you already have it.

00:16:39.891 --> 00:16:42.797
- Huh?
- Check your left pocket.

00:16:52.684 --> 00:16:56.090
(suspenseful music)

00:16:57.627 --> 00:16:58.796
- Like magic.

00:16:58.896 --> 00:17:00.465
- You aren't paying attention.

00:17:00.566 --> 00:17:03.839
That's why you're so easily
duped by guys.

00:17:03.939 --> 00:17:06.344
Listen, I've got a bunch
of priorities

00:17:06.444 --> 00:17:09.216
that I just can't change.

00:17:09.316 --> 00:17:10.620
Work comes first for me.

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:12.991
In fact, it probably
takes up more than 90%

00:17:13.091 --> 00:17:16.030
of my brain power and
everything else just doesn't

00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:17.232
matter as much.

00:17:17.332 --> 00:17:19.838
But my girl comes second.

00:17:19.938 --> 00:17:22.309
I need her to be someone
I can relax with.

00:17:22.409 --> 00:17:24.146
I won't be able to be with
you a lot of the time,

00:17:24.246 --> 00:17:28.054
but I won't let you
have a hard life.

00:17:28.154 --> 00:17:31.227
- As long as I'm your
number one second priority.

00:17:31.327 --> 00:17:33.699
- Sorry, but when it comes
to my second priority,

00:17:33.799 --> 00:17:35.035
you're in second place.

00:17:35.135 --> 00:17:35.670
- Ah?

00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:37.741
- This souvenir might
fit nicely on the girl

00:17:37.841 --> 00:17:38.976
who's in first place.

00:17:39.076 --> 00:17:39.276
- Shoes?

00:17:39.376 --> 00:17:41.180
- Especially since you're
too big to wear them.

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:45.288
- She's more petite
than me? (sighs)

00:17:45.388 --> 00:17:46.759
It's Sachiko.

00:17:47.794 --> 00:17:49.430
You've come back to haunt me.

00:17:49.531 --> 00:17:51.100
- You've already chosen a name?

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.438
It's kind of old fashioned
though.

00:17:53.539 --> 00:17:55.242
Well, whatever you want.

00:17:56.578 --> 00:17:59.684
- Here. Then these are
for our little Sachiko.

00:17:59.785 --> 00:18:02.924
(exciting music)

00:18:04.293 --> 00:18:08.268
- They're so cute. Thank
you daddy. (chuckles)

00:18:08.368 --> 00:18:09.504
And so many.

00:18:09.604 --> 00:18:11.407
- But it doesn't really sound
right.

00:18:11.508 --> 00:18:15.015
Sachiko itchy nose it's like
some sort of tongue twister.

00:18:15.115 --> 00:18:16.985
- She's not gonna have
an evil name like that.

00:18:17.085 --> 00:18:19.023
- You're the one that
chose the name.

00:18:23.666 --> 00:18:28.108
- [Shin] Reira, there's a
reason why I bought a laptop.

00:18:28.208 --> 00:18:29.945
It's because I wanted
to spend all the money

00:18:30.045 --> 00:18:32.617
you gave me as fast as I could.

00:18:32.717 --> 00:18:34.487
But at the same time,

00:18:34.588 --> 00:18:37.727
I didn't wanna spend it just on
myself.

00:18:37.827 --> 00:18:41.033
I bought the acoustic
guitar for the same reason.

00:18:41.134 --> 00:18:43.204
But I never feel like singing
when you're not around

00:18:43.304 --> 00:18:45.108
to hear me.

00:18:45.208 --> 00:18:48.248
So I'll email you as
much as I can.

00:18:48.348 --> 00:18:49.483
And if you feel like it,

00:18:49.584 --> 00:18:52.356
I'd love to get emails
from you too.

00:18:52.456 --> 00:18:54.426
Let's talk soon, okay?

00:18:54.528 --> 00:18:55.997
The weather was clear today,

00:18:56.097 --> 00:18:58.803
so there'll be a lot of
stars out tonight.

00:18:59.871 --> 00:19:05.883
(lighter whooshing)
(suspenseful music)

00:19:05.983 --> 00:19:08.889
- Hey, Mr. Law breaking lawyer.

00:19:08.989 --> 00:19:12.296
What do you think you're doing
hiding out here in the dark?

00:19:12.396 --> 00:19:13.198
- The same goes for you.

00:19:13.298 --> 00:19:15.268
You shouldn't be wandering
around alone

00:19:15.368 --> 00:19:16.337
in the middle of the night.

00:19:16.437 --> 00:19:16.905
It's dangerous.

00:19:17.005 --> 00:19:21.047
- It's that Tanuki's fault
with the unannounced shows.

00:19:21.147 --> 00:19:22.750
I'm too psyched to fall asleep.

00:19:22.851 --> 00:19:24.688
- You should sleep while you
can.

00:19:24.788 --> 00:19:25.923
When we get back to
Tokyo,

00:19:26.023 --> 00:19:28.896
we're gonna be crazy
busy promoting our band.

00:19:31.969 --> 00:19:33.404
- Wanna go to bed with me?

00:19:33.506 --> 00:19:34.975
- Sure. Why not?

00:19:37.412 --> 00:19:39.383
You know that was a joke, right?

00:19:39.483 --> 00:19:41.688
- Well it wasn't funny.

00:19:44.226 --> 00:19:47.432
That's because you're
in love with me, right?

00:19:47.534 --> 00:19:49.203
- Yeah, you got me.

00:19:50.405 --> 00:19:52.777
Now that I've laid all
my cards on the table,

00:19:52.877 --> 00:19:54.781
there's no point in denying it.

00:19:54.881 --> 00:19:56.785
Was I too obvious?

00:19:59.658 --> 00:20:01.027
- You're damn right, baldy.

00:20:01.127 --> 00:20:03.498
What exactly is going on with
you anyway?

00:20:03.599 --> 00:20:06.137
- Nothing really. So don't
worry.

00:20:06.237 --> 00:20:07.874
You just sing.

00:20:09.009 --> 00:20:12.650
- But Yasu, ever since
Ren and I first broke up

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:17.794
2 1/2 years ago, I felt closer
to you than I have to him.

00:20:19.864 --> 00:20:24.206
Even when I'm with Ren,
I'm lonely inside.

00:20:24.841 --> 00:20:26.878
It's not like before.

00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:30.118
It's like we're not one anymore.

00:20:32.422 --> 00:20:33.959
I don't know why,

00:20:35.362 --> 00:20:39.169
because I still love Ren
the same as I always have.

00:20:40.506 --> 00:20:43.946
- Mai, Yui, Sumire, Akane,

00:20:44.046 --> 00:20:45.816
I think a name with one kanji
character

00:20:45.917 --> 00:20:46.818
works the best

00:20:46.919 --> 00:20:48.722
and it'll look nice
next to your last name,

00:20:48.822 --> 00:20:50.091
which has three characters.

00:20:50.191 --> 00:20:50.693
Don't you think?

00:20:50.793 --> 00:20:51.628
- What's wrong with Sachiko?

00:20:51.728 --> 00:20:54.199
- You don't like it, just help
me come up with a good name.

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:56.605
- And I'm already kind of
attached to it.

00:20:56.705 --> 00:20:59.076
- It's gonna be Sachiko.

00:20:59.176 --> 00:21:02.115
- [Nana] Hey, Hachi, the
stars are sprinkled all across

00:21:02.215 --> 00:21:06.658
the sky and tonight they're
shining bright as ever.

00:21:06.758 --> 00:21:08.328
(suspenseful music)

00:21:08.428 --> 00:21:11.233
Even now when I see something
sparkling,

00:21:11.334 --> 00:21:12.637
it reminds me of Ren.

00:21:12.737 --> 00:21:15.241
(upbeat music)
