WEBVTT

00:00:01.971 --> 00:00:02.471
(vending machine clatters)

00:00:03.452 --> 00:00:05.991
- [Nana Osaki] The summer I
turned 16,

00:00:06.091 --> 00:00:09.030
I switched to SevenStars
cigarettes.

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:11.569
'Cause that's what Ren smoked.

00:00:12.872 --> 00:00:15.176
We got the same piercings.

00:00:15.276 --> 00:00:17.782
We wore matching combat boots.

00:00:17.882 --> 00:00:20.119
We slept in the same bed,

00:00:20.219 --> 00:00:22.257
and we shared a dream together.

00:00:23.058 --> 00:00:25.931
But then Ren abandoned me.

00:00:26.031 --> 00:00:28.169
(birds chirping)

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:31.943
Somewhere in my heart I never
forgave him for doing that.

00:00:34.314 --> 00:00:37.087
Just like I could never forgive
my mother.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.032
(high intensity techno music)

00:02:17.053 --> 00:02:19.825
(Nana blows softly)
(waves lapping softly)

00:02:19.926 --> 00:02:23.299
(soft piano music)

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.747
- [Nana Osaki] I have no
willpower.

00:02:30.847 --> 00:02:33.085
This is my fifth cigarette.

00:02:33.185 --> 00:02:35.591
I could only quit for three
months.

00:02:35.691 --> 00:02:38.530
But how else can I calm myself
down?

00:02:40.266 --> 00:02:42.705
(Nana blows softly)

00:02:42.805 --> 00:02:44.742
I wonder what Nobuo's gonna do.

00:02:46.178 --> 00:02:48.349
I was probably too harsh on him.

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:53.425
I'll have to tell him I'm
sorry when I see him at work.

00:02:55.096 --> 00:02:56.398
If he shows up.

00:03:07.855 --> 00:03:10.092
I'm so tired.

00:03:10.192 --> 00:03:12.831
I really don't want
to go to work.

00:03:12.932 --> 00:03:15.971
But I've gotta work
to make money.

00:03:16.071 --> 00:03:17.708
At least we don't have to rent
a studio

00:03:17.808 --> 00:03:19.477
to practice in
anymore.

00:03:19.578 --> 00:03:21.849
God, when are we gonna debut?

00:03:25.824 --> 00:03:27.661
I wonder if Hach is asleep.

00:03:30.032 --> 00:03:31.569
Takumi's gotta record today

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:34.140
so he must have taken off
by now.

00:03:35.176 --> 00:03:38.182
(footsteps tapping)

00:03:38.282 --> 00:03:39.484
- Welcome home.

00:03:45.664 --> 00:03:47.000
(Nana grunts)

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.268
(door shuts)

00:03:48.369 --> 00:03:50.607
(footsteps tapping)

00:03:50.707 --> 00:03:52.377
Don't just ignore me!

00:03:54.014 --> 00:03:55.149
(door thuds)
(Nana grunts)

00:03:55.249 --> 00:03:56.418
Come and sit down with us.

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:57.888
We've got important stuff to
talk about.

00:03:57.988 --> 00:04:00.126
- I can't, I've gotta get
changed and go to work!

00:04:00.226 --> 00:04:02.430
- Then come out after
you're done changing.

00:04:02.531 --> 00:04:04.669
It's not gonna take very long.

00:04:07.908 --> 00:04:09.879
And put out that cigarette.

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:12.383
It's not good for the
baby's health.

00:04:13.653 --> 00:04:15.757
(door shuts)

00:04:15.857 --> 00:04:17.460
- Calm down.

00:04:18.763 --> 00:04:21.435
Remember, no matter what
Hachi decides,

00:04:21.536 --> 00:04:23.472
just watch over her gently.

00:04:24.608 --> 00:04:25.677
Huh?

00:04:32.791 --> 00:04:35.564
(door creaks)

00:04:39.672 --> 00:04:42.477
- Do you want some more
grapefruit juice, babe?

00:04:44.982 --> 00:04:47.721
(door shuts)

00:04:58.375 --> 00:05:01.014
We've decided to get married.

00:05:01.114 --> 00:05:02.450
(gasps softly)

00:05:02.551 --> 00:05:03.553
- Huh?

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:06.526
Married?

00:05:06.626 --> 00:05:09.097
- Which means I'll be
consulting with my agent

00:05:09.197 --> 00:05:12.170
on how exactly we wanna
proceed with things.

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:13.640
But I know I want to hurry

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.080
and get a new place where
we can live together.

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.115
There are no elevators here

00:05:18.215 --> 00:05:20.754
and that'll be tough for
Nana when she gets bigger

00:05:20.854 --> 00:05:24.127
and we'll need a place
that has security.

00:05:24.227 --> 00:05:25.897
So I am sorry it's short notice

00:05:25.997 --> 00:05:29.538
but that means you're gonna
need to find a new roommate.

00:05:31.475 --> 00:05:32.778
- [Nana Osaki] What the hell?

00:05:32.878 --> 00:05:36.051
Why is everything
happening so fast?

00:05:36.151 --> 00:05:39.925
She never even came to me
and told me she was pregnant.

00:05:41.361 --> 00:05:42.965
And what about Nobuo?

00:05:44.334 --> 00:05:46.706
Why aren't you saying anything?

00:05:46.806 --> 00:05:48.442
This is totally insane.

00:05:48.543 --> 00:05:50.146
- I imagine this is an
inconvenience

00:05:50.246 --> 00:05:51.783
for you that's happening all of
a sudden.

00:05:51.883 --> 00:05:54.220
So I will pay her
half of the rent

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.289
till you find someone new.

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:56.793
- I don't need it!

00:05:56.893 --> 00:05:57.528
- Are you sure?

00:05:57.628 --> 00:06:00.032
I mean, we are the ones
putting you in this position.

00:06:00.132 --> 00:06:02.336
- Actually, the
timing's perfect.

00:06:02.437 --> 00:06:05.744
I was thinking of moving
in with Ren anyway.

00:06:05.844 --> 00:06:08.716
So I guess we'll just
ditch this place.

00:06:09.552 --> 00:06:12.724
(soft dramatic music)

00:06:12.825 --> 00:06:17.501
- Well, actually, I wanted to
talk to you about that too.

00:06:17.601 --> 00:06:20.339
How much have you really
thought about Ren's situation?

00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:21.174
- [Nana Osaki] What?

00:06:21.274 --> 00:06:21.909
- Your relationship with him

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:25.349
is the kind of juicy dirt
the tabloids go after.

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:26.284
You know what'll happen

00:06:26.384 --> 00:06:28.255
when they start digging
into your past.

00:06:28.355 --> 00:06:29.758
- Yeah. What's your point?

00:06:29.859 --> 00:06:32.196
If Trapnest goes down
because of some scandal

00:06:32.296 --> 00:06:33.633
then it's not much of a band.

00:06:33.733 --> 00:06:35.670
- (sighs) All I'm worried
about here

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:39.712
is Trapnest getting
too much unwanted attention.

00:06:39.812 --> 00:06:42.150
When a band gets as big as
we are

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:43.787
it seems people
start fixating more

00:06:43.887 --> 00:06:46.659
on the personal stuff
and less on the music.

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:50.132
I know it's unavoidable and
there are some advantages.

00:06:50.232 --> 00:06:52.436
But even though I know that,

00:06:52.538 --> 00:06:55.176
I would hate it if Trapnest
got a bunch of publicity

00:06:55.276 --> 00:06:57.648
for anything other
than our music.

00:06:57.748 --> 00:07:00.319
That's why it's important for
me to try to stop any scandals

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:02.524
before they have a chance
to start.

00:07:02.624 --> 00:07:05.129
You're a musician,
so you know what I mean.

00:07:05.229 --> 00:07:06.464
Right?

00:07:07.968 --> 00:07:10.472
- So then why is it that you're
okay with getting married?

00:07:10.574 --> 00:07:12.511
- Well, most of our fans
don't look at me

00:07:12.611 --> 00:07:14.013
the same way they look at Ren.

00:07:14.113 --> 00:07:17.386
I don't think they'll really
care if I get married or not.

00:07:17.487 --> 00:07:19.457
Besides, I'm sure you
don't want to draw

00:07:19.558 --> 00:07:19.992
that sort of attention

00:07:20.092 --> 00:07:23.666
before your label
releases your debut album.

00:07:23.766 --> 00:07:24.835
- Of course I don't want that.

00:07:24.935 --> 00:07:26.839
Don't talk to me like
I don't know anything!

00:07:26.939 --> 00:07:29.177
- Then you should just
cool things down a bit.

00:07:29.277 --> 00:07:31.749
I'm not saying don't see
him, just...

00:07:33.452 --> 00:07:34.855
- I got it.

00:07:34.955 --> 00:07:36.291
I'll be more careful.

00:07:36.391 --> 00:07:37.561
- I'm glad you get it.

00:07:37.661 --> 00:07:40.634
I tried talking to Ren about
this and he totally ignored me.

00:07:40.734 --> 00:07:43.105
It's something that's been
bugging me for a while now.

00:07:43.205 --> 00:07:45.175
- Huh?

00:07:45.276 --> 00:07:47.548
- Well, that's all I
wanted to say.

00:07:47.648 --> 00:07:49.083
I guess I'll get
going.

00:07:49.184 --> 00:07:52.591
(footsteps tapping)

00:07:54.294 --> 00:07:56.532
- [Nana Osaki] What's with her?

00:07:56.632 --> 00:07:58.970
It's like, she's his lap dog.

00:08:04.682 --> 00:08:07.253
- I won't be able to come
over while we're recording,

00:08:07.353 --> 00:08:07.788
but when it's finished

00:08:07.888 --> 00:08:09.792
I'll go with you and talk
to your parents.

00:08:09.892 --> 00:08:11.729
So there's no need for you
to worry.

00:08:11.829 --> 00:08:14.300
And I want you to get
plenty of rest.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.271
- But I'm not bedridden.

00:08:16.371 --> 00:08:19.678
I can go see a real estate
agent while you're recording.

00:08:19.778 --> 00:08:22.618
What kind of place should
I look for?

00:08:22.718 --> 00:08:24.622
- Well, aren't you
miss impatient?

00:08:24.722 --> 00:08:26.559
You really wanna play newlyweds
right away, don't you?

00:08:26.659 --> 00:08:28.897
- I was just thinking
you're gonna be really busy,

00:08:28.997 --> 00:08:31.702
so that's something
I can help out with.

00:08:32.571 --> 00:08:34.340
- I think you wanna move
out fast

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.311
'cause it's hard for you
to be with Nana.

00:08:36.411 --> 00:08:37.748
She's pretty close to Nobuo,

00:08:37.848 --> 00:08:39.384
I'm sure that makes
things awkward.

00:08:39.484 --> 00:08:40.787
And she doesn't make much of
an effort

00:08:40.887 --> 00:08:43.526
to hide the fact
that she's upset.

00:08:48.803 --> 00:08:51.041
I'll have someone at the
agency start looking for places

00:08:51.141 --> 00:08:53.211
and make up a list for you
right away.

00:08:53.312 --> 00:08:54.548
Then as soon as you're
feeling better

00:08:54.648 --> 00:08:55.717
you can check them out.

00:08:55.817 --> 00:08:58.055
Choose the one you
like best, okay?

00:09:01.729 --> 00:09:03.600
You're not looking as pale
anymore.

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:05.069
Is the nausea gone?

00:09:05.169 --> 00:09:06.939
- Yeah. Thanks.

00:09:07.039 --> 00:09:08.075
I feel better.

00:09:15.857 --> 00:09:20.667
Takumi, I thought you had
to get going to the studio?

00:09:20.767 --> 00:09:22.971
- I've got plenty of time.

00:09:23.071 --> 00:09:26.144
- But it might not be good for
the baby.

00:09:26.244 --> 00:09:26.979
- [Takumi] Don't worry.

00:09:27.079 --> 00:09:27.814
It'll be fine.

00:09:27.914 --> 00:09:29.017
- [Nana Komatsu] Nana will hear
us.

00:09:29.117 --> 00:09:29.585
- [Takumi] Don't worry.

00:09:29.685 --> 00:09:32.658
Just keep your voice down
and she won't notice.

00:09:32.758 --> 00:09:34.662
- But she's already
so mad at me.

00:09:34.762 --> 00:09:38.268
- Yeah. Well don't you
realize how mad I've been?

00:09:38.368 --> 00:09:39.905
(soft music)

00:09:40.005 --> 00:09:43.579
I can't stand to think that
another guy was inside you.

00:09:46.151 --> 00:09:48.155
You don't need to worry about
anything.

00:09:48.255 --> 00:09:52.163
Just focus on making me happy.

00:09:52.263 --> 00:09:54.434
- [Nana Osaki] That bed we
bought at Mizukoshi store

00:09:54.535 --> 00:09:58.175
was old and the springs
always squeak.

00:10:01.281 --> 00:10:03.886
It's driving me crazy.

00:10:03.987 --> 00:10:05.289
- [Nana Komatsu] You're way more
important

00:10:05.389 --> 00:10:07.493
than any boyfriend, Nana.

00:10:07.594 --> 00:10:09.397
- [Nana Osaki] Liar.

00:10:09.497 --> 00:10:11.368
- [Nana Komatsu] I think
I'm head over heels

00:10:11.468 --> 00:10:13.005
in love with Nobuo.

00:10:13.706 --> 00:10:15.142
- [Nana Osaki] Traitor.

00:10:18.115 --> 00:10:19.350
- [Takumi] That means you'll
need to look

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:21.388
for a new roommate.

00:10:21.488 --> 00:10:24.561
- [Nana Osaki] Why the hell
couldn't you tell me yourself?

00:10:24.661 --> 00:10:27.801
(glass clinking)

00:10:29.037 --> 00:10:29.738
- [Nana Komatsu] 'Cause
if you don't like them,

00:10:29.838 --> 00:10:30.673
I don't want them.

00:10:30.774 --> 00:10:31.776
There's no point in
me buying them

00:10:31.876 --> 00:10:33.946
unless we're both
gonna use them.

00:10:34.047 --> 00:10:36.819
- [Nana Osaki] Why don't you
use the strawberry glass?

00:10:36.919 --> 00:10:38.589
- 'Cause we only have
two of them.

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:40.059
What if one of them breaks?

00:10:40.159 --> 00:10:42.964
- But what's the point
if you never use them?

00:10:43.065 --> 00:10:44.735
- [Nana Komatsu] Yeah but
they're a set.

00:10:44.835 --> 00:10:50.513
It'd be sad if one
of them breaks.

00:10:51.682 --> 00:10:57.193
You can use them, just
be careful, okay?

00:10:58.495 --> 00:11:01.635
(glass shatters)

00:11:05.309 --> 00:11:08.248
(water dripping)

00:11:12.858 --> 00:11:16.632
It'd be sad if one
of them breaks.

00:11:16.732 --> 00:11:20.874
(Nana Osaki sobbing softly)

00:11:27.119 --> 00:11:29.858
(soft music)

00:11:35.436 --> 00:11:38.576
(glass shatters)

00:11:49.531 --> 00:11:51.101
(glass shatters)

00:11:51.201 --> 00:11:51.769
- Nana?

00:11:51.869 --> 00:11:53.338
- Don't worry about her.

00:11:54.808 --> 00:11:55.810
- [Nana Osaki] Good.

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:57.313
Now they're together.

00:12:01.421 --> 00:12:03.358
I'm not sad anymore.

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:12.143
(alarm beeping)

00:12:14.681 --> 00:12:17.687
(Ren groaning)

00:12:23.265 --> 00:12:24.300
- Huh?

00:12:26.437 --> 00:12:28.676
What time did she come over?

00:12:37.293 --> 00:12:40.265
- Don't ever let go of this hand
you hold.

00:12:40.365 --> 00:12:41.067
Even though there's no ring

00:12:41.167 --> 00:12:45.944
or red string tying a vow
to this trembling finger.

00:12:46.044 --> 00:12:48.348
What kind of innocent love song
is this?

00:12:48.448 --> 00:12:51.522
If you ask me, it sounds more
like it's about an affair.

00:12:51.622 --> 00:12:52.456
- Oh yeah!

00:12:52.557 --> 00:12:53.893
'Cause there's no ring, right?

00:12:53.993 --> 00:12:54.528
- Yeah.

00:12:54.628 --> 00:12:55.028
But it could also mean

00:12:55.128 --> 00:12:57.433
that the guy has a ring on
his finger.

00:12:57.534 --> 00:12:58.001
(Reira gasps)

00:12:58.101 --> 00:13:00.773
- I thought you've been
acting kinda weird lately.

00:13:00.874 --> 00:13:02.878
Reira, are you hooking
up with a married man?

00:13:02.978 --> 00:13:05.148
- That isn't what the
song is about.

00:13:05.249 --> 00:13:05.482
- But you know,

00:13:05.583 --> 00:13:08.121
songs about affairs are
pretty popular right now.

00:13:08.221 --> 00:13:10.225
- No Mari, this is real
true love.

00:13:10.325 --> 00:13:12.062
A love that binds
people together.

00:13:12.162 --> 00:13:13.900
But one where you don't
even kiss.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.437
- Speaking of rings
and promises, Take?

00:13:16.539 --> 00:13:17.306
- Yeah?

00:13:17.406 --> 00:13:18.341
- I'm gonna be getting married.

00:13:18.441 --> 00:13:20.445
(all gasping)
That's no problem, right?

00:13:20.547 --> 00:13:22.049
- [All] You're getting married?

00:13:22.149 --> 00:13:23.819
- What the hell are you
saying, Takumi?

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:25.657
And you choose now of all
times?

00:13:25.757 --> 00:13:26.959
- Calm down, Take.

00:13:27.059 --> 00:13:28.495
I trust everyone in this room.

00:13:28.596 --> 00:13:29.463
- Oh man!

00:13:29.565 --> 00:13:30.132
What's going on?

00:13:30.232 --> 00:13:32.169
Dude, you getting married
is even less likely

00:13:32.269 --> 00:13:35.108
than this new single
selling 10 million copies.

00:13:35.209 --> 00:13:37.313
- Yeah. Well, my lady's
pregnant.

00:13:37.413 --> 00:13:38.348
- [Take] Hachiko?

00:13:38.448 --> 00:13:39.518
- [Takumi] How'd you know that?

00:13:39.618 --> 00:13:40.753
- [Take] It's just not like you.

00:13:40.853 --> 00:13:43.091
It's not like you at all.

00:13:43.191 --> 00:13:45.730
- [Ren] Couldn't the kid
be Nobuo's?

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:47.534
- How could you let yourself
fall prey

00:13:47.634 --> 00:13:49.270
to Hachiko's evil schemes?

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:49.805
- Evil schemes?

00:13:49.905 --> 00:13:52.243
- The only thing she wants
is to marry a rock star

00:13:52.343 --> 00:13:53.011
and spend all his money.

00:13:53.111 --> 00:13:56.084
I bet she lured you in
while she was ovulating.

00:13:56.184 --> 00:13:57.453
(chiming music)

00:13:57.554 --> 00:13:58.656
- Takumi!

00:13:58.756 --> 00:14:01.294
I wanna see you.

00:14:01.394 --> 00:14:04.066
- Nah, I doubt this was
something she did on purpose

00:14:04.166 --> 00:14:06.437
but maybe it's what she wants
now.

00:14:06.538 --> 00:14:08.910
- But what about love, man?

00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:11.180
- I'm pretty sure that
love will come later.

00:14:11.281 --> 00:14:13.920
The people I've met
usually love themselves

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:15.088
more than anyone else.

00:14:15.188 --> 00:14:17.794
So they end up loving
those who best accommodate

00:14:17.894 --> 00:14:19.230
their own desires at the time.

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:21.602
- Yeah. That's one way of
looking at it.

00:14:21.702 --> 00:14:22.871
- Huh?

00:14:22.971 --> 00:14:23.739
- Come on.

00:14:23.839 --> 00:14:24.641
It's cool.

00:14:24.741 --> 00:14:26.210
Let's let this bastard
marry the bimbo.

00:14:26.311 --> 00:14:28.014
I'm sure it'll be a
total train wreck

00:14:28.114 --> 00:14:29.383
for however long
it'll last.

00:14:29.483 --> 00:14:31.387
But aren't you dying
to see what happens?

00:14:31.487 --> 00:14:33.759
- Geez, Kasai, you're
not really helping here.

00:14:33.859 --> 00:14:35.228
We'll see what the president
says.

00:14:35.329 --> 00:14:37.701
Okay, until then, please
everyone keep it a secret?

00:14:37.801 --> 00:14:38.335
- Don't be stupid.

00:14:38.435 --> 00:14:40.873
If I want to get married,
I'm gonna get married.

00:14:40.974 --> 00:14:43.445
- Well then, let's get
back to business.

00:14:43.546 --> 00:14:44.013
What do you say?

00:14:44.113 --> 00:14:45.850
- Hold up, where's Reira?

00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:47.721
- She was here just a
minute ago.

00:14:47.821 --> 00:14:49.725
- I'm sure she'll be
right back.

00:14:49.825 --> 00:14:52.029
We usually record the
vocals last anyway.

00:14:52.129 --> 00:14:55.135
We can just work with the
scratch track for now.

00:14:56.437 --> 00:14:59.477
- Hey Mari, could you go
look for her just in case?

00:14:59.578 --> 00:15:01.114
- Yeah, of course.

00:15:08.161 --> 00:15:11.301
- [Shinichi] Really?
Reira is your real name?

00:15:11.401 --> 00:15:15.777
- [Layla] Yep, well almost,
it's spelled L-A-Y-L-A.

00:15:15.877 --> 00:15:18.448
You know the Clapton
song, Layla?

00:15:18.549 --> 00:15:21.220
- Yeah. I mean, who
doesn't know that song?

00:15:21.321 --> 00:15:23.491
- Well, my dad was really into
that song

00:15:23.592 --> 00:15:26.164
and he named me after it.

00:15:26.264 --> 00:15:28.569
I like to listen to that song
sometimes

00:15:28.669 --> 00:15:30.472
when I'm alone in my room,

00:15:30.573 --> 00:15:32.510
and then I don't feel so lonely.

00:15:33.913 --> 00:15:36.217
- [Shinichi] Lovely Layla.

00:15:36.317 --> 00:15:39.323
Awesome title but it's
different in the Japanese.

00:15:39.423 --> 00:15:41.929
- That'll be 5,500 yen.

00:15:42.597 --> 00:15:45.536
(money rustling)

00:15:48.743 --> 00:15:50.245
- [Layla] I'll call you.

00:15:51.682 --> 00:15:55.055
(sad gentle music)

00:16:06.044 --> 00:16:09.083
(phone ringing)

00:16:11.522 --> 00:16:12.557
- Hey.

00:16:15.362 --> 00:16:16.397
Hello?

00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:20.540
Is anyone there?

00:16:21.709 --> 00:16:22.409
- [Layla] Shin?

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:23.913
- What's the matter?

00:16:24.013 --> 00:16:25.348
Reira, where are you?

00:16:25.449 --> 00:16:27.654
Did something happen in the
studio?

00:16:27.754 --> 00:16:29.691
(Reira crying)

00:16:29.791 --> 00:16:31.862
What happened? You can tell me.

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:37.406
Reira, are you alright?

00:16:38.809 --> 00:16:41.047
- [Layla] I need to ask you a
favor.

00:16:41.882 --> 00:16:42.784
- Hm?

00:16:42.884 --> 00:16:43.853
- [Layla] I'm sorry.

00:16:43.953 --> 00:16:45.489
- Just tell me what it is.

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:47.292
I'll do anything I can.

00:16:49.497 --> 00:16:52.136
(Reira crying)

00:16:52.236 --> 00:16:55.008
I don't want anymore money,
so...

00:16:56.845 --> 00:16:59.417
(Reira crying)

00:16:59.518 --> 00:17:01.087
- Yasu?
- What?

00:17:03.425 --> 00:17:04.594
What about him?

00:17:06.464 --> 00:17:09.370
- [Reira] Could you give me
Yasus' number?

00:17:16.084 --> 00:17:19.457
(footsteps tapping)

00:17:33.819 --> 00:17:37.192
(plastic rustling)

00:17:41.167 --> 00:17:44.440
(lighter igniting)

00:17:44.541 --> 00:17:47.947
(Yasu blows softly)

00:17:55.295 --> 00:17:58.702
(footsteps tapping)

00:18:16.839 --> 00:18:19.978
(door clacking)

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:27.226
(door shuts)

00:18:31.768 --> 00:18:34.608
(phone ringing)

00:18:39.016 --> 00:18:42.489
(Nana Osaki groaning)

00:18:43.926 --> 00:18:44.426
- Hello?

00:18:44.528 --> 00:18:46.297
- [Nobuo] Nana, what
the hell are you doing?

00:18:46.397 --> 00:18:49.336
I've been worried about you all
day.

00:18:49.436 --> 00:18:49.638
- Nobuo?

00:18:49.738 --> 00:18:52.610
- I've tried calling you a
billion times since this
morning.

00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:55.382
I went a bit crazy last night
and said some mean things,

00:18:55.482 --> 00:18:57.052
but I'm the one this is
happening to.

00:18:57.152 --> 00:18:59.724
So why the hell do
you get a day off?

00:18:59.824 --> 00:19:00.626
I'm starting to hate myself

00:19:00.726 --> 00:19:03.666
for trying to do the
right thing all the time.

00:19:06.103 --> 00:19:08.041
- [Nana Osaki] Uh. Sorry.

00:19:08.141 --> 00:19:08.976
- It's okay.

00:19:09.076 --> 00:19:10.011
Don't worry.

00:19:10.111 --> 00:19:11.214
Over the years, I've gotten used

00:19:11.314 --> 00:19:13.652
to your whacked out way
of dealing with things.

00:19:13.752 --> 00:19:16.157
Oh, and I covered for
you at work today.

00:19:16.257 --> 00:19:18.161
Where are you now?

00:19:23.672 --> 00:19:25.442
- At Ren's place.

00:19:25.543 --> 00:19:28.649
- I'm guessing Ren's not there
'cause they're recording.

00:19:28.749 --> 00:19:30.218
No, I just got off work.

00:19:30.318 --> 00:19:33.626
You wanna grab something to
eat together before practice?

00:19:33.726 --> 00:19:34.628
- [Nana Osaki] Nobuo.

00:19:34.728 --> 00:19:35.462
- I'll pay!

00:19:35.563 --> 00:19:37.967
I just really need to
vent right now.

00:19:38.067 --> 00:19:39.704
- [Nana Osaki] I think
there's something

00:19:39.804 --> 00:19:41.073
really wrong with me.

00:19:41.173 --> 00:19:41.942
- Come on!

00:19:42.042 --> 00:19:44.013
You don't think I already know
that?

00:19:44.113 --> 00:19:46.551
- I can't remember why I came
here

00:19:46.652 --> 00:19:48.956
or even how I got here.

00:19:49.056 --> 00:19:50.826
I don't even know if I'm awake.

00:19:52.296 --> 00:19:55.235
(soft music)

00:20:02.416 --> 00:20:03.686
The last thing I remember

00:20:03.786 --> 00:20:07.326
was the strawberry glass
rolling off the table.

00:20:09.564 --> 00:20:11.868
Those were the first
things we bought together

00:20:11.969 --> 00:20:13.505
for our apartment.

00:20:14.774 --> 00:20:16.444
It was falling...

00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:21.120
About to hit the floor.

00:20:23.391 --> 00:20:25.863
But I don't know if I caught it
in time.

00:20:33.144 --> 00:20:36.585
(Nana Komatsu crying)

00:20:42.296 --> 00:20:43.632
Hey Hachi,

00:20:44.567 --> 00:20:47.239
I was like that cheap glass.

00:20:47.339 --> 00:20:49.711
I was too weak to accept
you as you are.

00:20:54.988 --> 00:20:58.962
It's just that I prefer the
pain of breaking into pieces.

00:20:59.063 --> 00:21:02.503
And the loneliness I felt
from losing everything.

00:21:04.841 --> 00:21:07.680
(upbeat music)

00:21:08.949 --> 00:21:10.418
I was too fragile.

00:21:11.922 --> 00:21:13.559
It's not your fault.
