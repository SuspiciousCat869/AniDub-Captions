00:00:01.035 --> 00:00:01.737
(lighthearted music)

00:00:01.837 --> 00:00:05.210
(insects chirping)

00:00:08.684 --> 00:00:12.157
(lighthearted music)

00:00:22.952 --> 00:00:26.025
- [Hachiko] Back then,
I made so many wishes

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:28.296
I couldn't count them all.

00:00:28.396 --> 00:00:32.004
(upbeat Japanese music)

00:02:07.227 --> 00:02:11.603
- July the 7th, it's cursed.

00:02:11.703 --> 00:02:12.471
- Why is that?

00:02:12.572 --> 00:02:15.043
- You notice how Nana stops
saying things like that lately.

00:02:15.143 --> 00:02:17.014
Everything used to be
the Demon Lord's fault.

00:02:17.114 --> 00:02:19.385
Demon Lord this, Demon Lord
that,

00:02:19.485 --> 00:02:21.823
maybe she's starting to grow up
a little.

00:02:21.923 --> 00:02:22.692
(Kyosuke laughs)

00:02:22.792 --> 00:02:24.562
- Well, I sure hope so.

00:02:26.967 --> 00:02:29.004
- Kyosuke, what do you want?

00:02:29.104 --> 00:02:30.674
Sunny side up or scrambled?

00:02:30.775 --> 00:02:32.277
- Sunny side, thanks.

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:35.383
It's a shame.

00:02:35.483 --> 00:02:39.258
Nana doesn't come by to visit
us as much as she used to.

00:02:39.358 --> 00:02:40.427
Now that I think about it,

00:02:40.528 --> 00:02:42.665
it's been quite a while
since I've seen her.

00:02:42.765 --> 00:02:43.767
How's she been doing?

00:02:43.867 --> 00:02:44.569
- Oh, right, I forgot.

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:46.472
You didn't make it to
her roommate's concert.

00:02:46.573 --> 00:02:49.646
You must have been working
late that night or something.

00:02:49.746 --> 00:02:51.182
I think she's doing okay

00:02:51.282 --> 00:02:53.821
but I've got a feeling
something's up with her.

00:02:53.921 --> 00:02:55.958
- Oh, that's right, you
thought you could smell

00:02:56.058 --> 00:02:57.695
a new guy in her life.

00:02:57.795 --> 00:02:59.465
- Yeah, but she won't admit it.

00:02:59.566 --> 00:03:00.433
- What about work?

00:03:00.534 --> 00:03:01.268
Did she find a new job?

00:03:01.368 --> 00:03:02.972
- Arg.
- Uh?

00:03:03.072 --> 00:03:04.408
- I haven't heard anything about
that

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:06.580
so she probably hasn't found
anything yet.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.784
She mentioned something
about wanting to work

00:03:08.884 --> 00:03:10.220
in a hip clothing store.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.088
- It must have been a month

00:03:11.188 --> 00:03:13.727
since she lost her job at
the publishing company.

00:03:13.827 --> 00:03:14.996
How is she getting by?

00:03:15.096 --> 00:03:16.900
- Well, she's surviving.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.169
She said she's been doing odd
jobs

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.039
here and there to make ends
meet.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.580
- But there can't be
that many odd jobs out there.

00:03:24.114 --> 00:03:24.582
- Yeah, I know.

00:03:24.682 --> 00:03:26.887
But she also signed up
with this temp agency

00:03:26.987 --> 00:03:28.156
that does street promotions.

00:03:28.256 --> 00:03:30.528
- Street promotions,
what does that involve?

00:03:30.628 --> 00:03:31.462
(lighthearted music)

00:03:31.563 --> 00:03:35.003
- Hi, would you like to try
a sample of our new beer?

00:03:35.103 --> 00:03:37.107
You're gonna love it.

00:03:37.207 --> 00:03:39.278
Food and drink companies
use street promoters

00:03:39.378 --> 00:03:40.981
to help the market new products.

00:03:41.081 --> 00:03:43.119
For example, we might cook
sausages

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:45.791
or cut up fruit in supermarkets
and give out samples.

00:03:45.891 --> 00:03:49.899
Customers try the samples then
hopefully buy the product.

00:03:49.999 --> 00:03:51.636
Each campaign only lasts two or
three days

00:03:51.736 --> 00:03:55.143
but I get paid over
10,000 Yen a day.

00:03:55.243 --> 00:03:58.550
The only reason I started doing
it was because I was broke

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.124
but it's turning out to be
way more fun than I expected.

00:04:02.224 --> 00:04:05.931
- [Nana] You only like it
'cause you get free food, Hachi.

00:04:06.031 --> 00:04:08.436
- No, it's not that,
there's way more to it.

00:04:08.537 --> 00:04:12.578
It's because I have a
talent for customer service.

00:04:12.678 --> 00:04:13.814
Hey, is anybody listening?
- Nobuo, can you take

00:04:13.914 --> 00:04:15.083
a look at this?

00:04:15.183 --> 00:04:16.385
- Okay, sure.

00:04:16.485 --> 00:04:19.124
- I'm 100% positive that a
career in sales

00:04:19.224 --> 00:04:21.228
is just the right thing for me.

00:04:22.397 --> 00:04:24.669
I'm great at the whole
smile's a free thing.

00:04:24.769 --> 00:04:26.873
- You should work at
a fast food joint.

00:04:26.973 --> 00:04:27.575
They'd love you there.

00:04:27.675 --> 00:04:30.380
- I totally do it if they had
a really cute uniform to wear.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.883
Like for the beer promotion we
just did,

00:04:31.983 --> 00:04:35.089
I got to wear this adorable
mini skirt and I looked great.

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.294
- Hmm, I would've liked
to have seen that.

00:04:37.394 --> 00:04:39.599
- Did the old per in the
corner say something?

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:40.901
(Shin laughs)

00:04:41.001 --> 00:04:43.740
(footsteps approaching)

00:04:43.841 --> 00:04:46.713
- Oh, I can't see the Milky Way.

00:04:47.615 --> 00:04:49.652
(crickets chirping)

00:04:49.752 --> 00:04:53.125
I was looking forward to
seeing the stars tonight.

00:04:53.694 --> 00:04:54.529
- Hmm.

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:57.869
- Hey Nobuo, where do
you wanna meet tomorrow?

00:04:57.969 --> 00:05:00.708
Yasu is suggesting that we
just meet up at the concert.

00:05:00.808 --> 00:05:02.645
- [Nobuo] Okay, I'm
coming straight from work.

00:05:02.745 --> 00:05:05.049
So I won't be there till the
last minute

00:05:05.149 --> 00:05:06.485
- Tomorrow?

00:05:07.822 --> 00:05:09.659
Tomorrow's July the 8th.

00:05:10.293 --> 00:05:12.197
- He says that's fine.

00:05:12.297 --> 00:05:14.201
- Oh, yeah, tomorrow's
the last concert

00:05:14.301 --> 00:05:15.303
of the Trap Nest Tour.

00:05:15.403 --> 00:05:17.608
You three guys are on
the guest list, right?

00:05:17.708 --> 00:05:18.844
- Uh-uh.

00:05:18.944 --> 00:05:20.213
- [Hachiko] So where are you
sitting?

00:05:20.313 --> 00:05:22.117
I bet you've got amazing seats.

00:05:22.217 --> 00:05:22.985
- Not really.

00:05:23.085 --> 00:05:25.156
They're up in the balcony.

00:05:25.256 --> 00:05:26.726
We're supposed to get a
great view from up there

00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:29.566
but we're surrounded by all
the press and the staff.

00:05:29.666 --> 00:05:30.701
So it's gonna be dead.

00:05:30.801 --> 00:05:31.703
- What the hell?

00:05:31.803 --> 00:05:32.638
That's not cool

00:05:32.738 --> 00:05:33.239
(Nobuo laugh)

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:35.778
- But it's not as if we're
like their are other fans.

00:05:35.878 --> 00:05:36.613
It's probably better up there

00:05:36.713 --> 00:05:38.717
than being swamped by a
ton of screaming girls.

00:05:38.817 --> 00:05:41.155
You should have asked
Ren, he could have put you

00:05:41.255 --> 00:05:42.457
on the guest list too.

00:05:42.558 --> 00:05:44.963
You know, it's
still not too late.

00:05:45.063 --> 00:05:46.933
You want me to ask him for you?

00:05:47.033 --> 00:05:47.467
- That's okay.

00:05:47.568 --> 00:05:49.639
I saw them in concert
back home anyway.

00:05:49.739 --> 00:05:52.545
Besides I've got a lot
of things to do tomorrow.

00:05:52.645 --> 00:05:53.747
- That's totally wrong.

00:05:53.847 --> 00:05:55.985
You write your wish on it
then you have to hang it

00:05:56.085 --> 00:05:57.087
on a bamboo leaf.

00:05:57.187 --> 00:05:58.256
- What kind of wish?

00:05:58.356 --> 00:05:59.759
- You really don't know?

00:05:59.859 --> 00:06:00.694
- What's going on?

00:06:00.794 --> 00:06:01.028
- What's the matter?

00:06:01.128 --> 00:06:03.967
Shin says he is never seen
Tanabata decorations before,

00:06:04.067 --> 00:06:05.069
can you believe it?

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:07.107
He just asked me what
a Tanzaku was.

00:06:07.207 --> 00:06:08.309
- Seriously, dude.

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:09.746
What kind of life have you been
living?

00:06:09.846 --> 00:06:11.215
- You never made Tanzaku in
grade school?

00:06:11.315 --> 00:06:13.553
- I wanna write a
wish on a Tanzaku.

00:06:13.654 --> 00:06:15.791
- Then come to our place and
write one.

00:06:15.891 --> 00:06:17.628
I'm sure we've got a few extras.

00:06:17.728 --> 00:06:19.599
- Yay.

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:21.569
(lighthearted music)

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:23.272
(footsteps fading)

00:06:23.372 --> 00:06:25.911
You have Tanabata
decorations at home?

00:06:26.011 --> 00:06:27.347
- Not me, her.

00:06:27.447 --> 00:06:29.217
I couldn't give a damn.

00:06:30.119 --> 00:06:33.527
(crickets chirping)

00:06:36.432 --> 00:06:37.835
- Yes.

00:06:37.935 --> 00:06:40.373
- Defeat trap nest?

00:06:40.473 --> 00:06:42.778
Nobuo, that isn't something you
wish for,

00:06:42.878 --> 00:06:44.014
that's something you do.

00:06:44.114 --> 00:06:45.216
- Oh, really?

00:06:45.316 --> 00:06:46.753
(Nana laughs)

00:06:46.853 --> 00:06:49.224
- [Shini] Here, let me
write one for you, Nobuo.

00:06:49.324 --> 00:06:51.763
I want to be taller, Nobuo.

00:06:51.863 --> 00:06:53.800
- Write your own damn wishes.

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:55.504
Anyway, you're shorter than me.

00:06:55.604 --> 00:06:57.140
- Yeah, but I'm still growing.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.411
I'm gonna be way taller than you
someday.

00:06:59.512 --> 00:07:00.013
- Arg.

00:07:00.113 --> 00:07:01.916
- Oh, I know, I've got a good
one.

00:07:02.017 --> 00:07:04.287
I wish for a brand new
air conditioner.

00:07:04.388 --> 00:07:07.193
- I wish I could get back
that nice car I sold.

00:07:07.293 --> 00:07:09.164
- [Hachiko] I want a
balcony to put plants on.

00:07:09.264 --> 00:07:11.569
- I wish for lots of money.

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:14.074
- Oh, come on, don't you
guys have any big dreams

00:07:14.174 --> 00:07:14.609
you can wish for?

00:07:14.709 --> 00:07:17.013
- But it gets so damn hot
in here I can't stand it.

00:07:17.113 --> 00:07:17.982
- That's for sure.

00:07:18.082 --> 00:07:20.486
- I can't take the heat anymore.

00:07:20.587 --> 00:07:22.424
- Wait Nana, the wishes
are gonna blow away.

00:07:24.562 --> 00:07:26.131
Aw.

00:07:26.231 --> 00:07:29.706
(lighthearted music)

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:44.669
The Tokyo sky had been clear
that day,

00:07:44.769 --> 00:07:48.577
but by the time night rolled
around, it had clouded over.

00:07:48.677 --> 00:07:50.681
Even though we didn't
get to see the Milky Way,

00:07:50.781 --> 00:07:53.019
we were having the time
of our lives.

00:07:53.119 --> 00:07:56.593
(lighthearted music)

00:08:02.303 --> 00:08:04.107
I already knew that wishing on
its own

00:08:04.207 --> 00:08:06.245
doesn't make dreams come true.

00:08:06.345 --> 00:08:08.683
But I felt that even if
just one of our dreams

00:08:08.784 --> 00:08:12.257
came true, then that would
be enough to make me happy.

00:08:14.061 --> 00:08:14.461
- Good morning.

00:08:14.562 --> 00:08:17.367
It's Sunday, July the 8th
and it's time for Music Jay,

00:08:17.467 --> 00:08:19.237
bringing you a funky
mix of the latest hits

00:08:19.337 --> 00:08:20.473
and your favorite classics.

00:08:20.574 --> 00:08:22.043
We'll begin with the video from
a new band

00:08:22.143 --> 00:08:24.347
who are wrapping up their
first ever nationwide tour

00:08:24.448 --> 00:08:27.387
tonight here in Tokyo, Trap
Nest.

00:08:35.604 --> 00:08:38.543
- [Takumi] Hey, you know
when the tour's over,

00:08:38.643 --> 00:08:40.681
first thing I'll do is come and
see you.

00:08:40.781 --> 00:08:43.854
Maybe you can cook
me up something good.

00:08:50.466 --> 00:08:53.139
- He'll come, we won't come.

00:08:53.239 --> 00:08:58.784
He'll come, he won't come.

00:09:01.121 --> 00:09:04.896
Hold on, no one uses flowers
to predict the future anymore.

00:09:04.996 --> 00:09:06.566
What is wrong with me?

00:09:06.666 --> 00:09:08.369
I don't have to use a stupid
flower.

00:09:08.469 --> 00:09:09.739
I know he won't come.

00:09:09.839 --> 00:09:11.976
He didn't even answer my text
message.

00:09:12.076 --> 00:09:14.615
He's forgotten all about me.

00:09:15.884 --> 00:09:19.926
But just in case, even
if Takumi doesn't show,

00:09:20.026 --> 00:09:21.495
I know Ren will be there.

00:09:21.596 --> 00:09:22.297
There's not much difference

00:09:22.397 --> 00:09:25.203
between cooking for three or
four.

00:09:25.303 --> 00:09:28.944
(indistinct chatter)

00:09:29.044 --> 00:09:31.883
I'll have to make stuff that
tastes good even if it's cold

00:09:31.983 --> 00:09:34.755
'cause who knows when they'll be
arriving.

00:09:36.526 --> 00:09:38.028
- [Takumi] These tomatoes are
delicious.

00:09:38.129 --> 00:09:39.765
Where'd you get them from?

00:09:45.243 --> 00:09:47.013
- Are you sure, I can have all
these?

00:09:47.113 --> 00:09:48.382
Jun totally rock.

00:09:48.482 --> 00:09:50.386
- Me and Kyosuke can't
possibly eat them all

00:09:50.486 --> 00:09:51.890
and we only just got them.

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:53.025
They're freshly picked.

00:09:53.125 --> 00:09:54.461
- Lucky me.

00:09:54.562 --> 00:09:56.265
Thanks so much for everything,
Jun.

00:09:56.365 --> 00:09:57.133
See you later.

00:09:57.233 --> 00:09:58.068
- Don't be a stranger.

00:09:58.169 --> 00:10:00.306
Kyosuke was telling me he
hasn't seen you in a while.

00:10:00.406 --> 00:10:01.208
- I know.

00:10:01.308 --> 00:10:02.678
- So why are you buying
all these groceries?

00:10:02.778 --> 00:10:03.914
I thought you were broke.

00:10:04.014 --> 00:10:04.916
Are you having someone over?

00:10:05.016 --> 00:10:06.886
- Oh, no, just stocking up.

00:10:06.986 --> 00:10:07.955
(Nana laughs)

00:10:08.055 --> 00:10:09.291
- Oh.

00:10:10.928 --> 00:10:13.667
- It's probably better
if he doesn't show up.

00:10:13.767 --> 00:10:16.506
That way I could just forget
about him.

00:10:18.977 --> 00:10:21.481
Besides, if Takumi does come
over,

00:10:21.583 --> 00:10:24.154
I'm gonna have some
explaining to do to Nana.

00:10:24.254 --> 00:10:27.661
I wouldn't be able to
hide it from her anymore.

00:10:27.761 --> 00:10:31.870
Then again, maybe there's
nothing to hide.

00:10:34.876 --> 00:10:37.313
If Takumi's the sort of
guy who keeps his word

00:10:37.413 --> 00:10:39.351
and he comes over like he
promised,

00:10:39.451 --> 00:10:40.587
what's there to feel guilty
about.

00:10:40.687 --> 00:10:44.361
(door bell rings)

00:10:44.461 --> 00:10:47.400
(door opens)

00:10:52.978 --> 00:10:54.414
- Huh?

00:10:54.515 --> 00:10:58.355
(lighthearted music)

00:10:58.455 --> 00:10:59.992
- What are you doing, Hachiko?

00:11:00.092 --> 00:11:00.727
Who's going to eat all this?

00:11:00.827 --> 00:11:02.798
You got a major banquette laid
out here.

00:11:02.898 --> 00:11:06.606
- Yeah, I guess I kind of got
carried away with the food.

00:11:06.706 --> 00:11:09.512
I just figured they might
be hungry after the concert.

00:11:09.612 --> 00:11:11.549
Did Ren say what time he'd be
coming over?

00:11:11.649 --> 00:11:13.385
- Uh, Ren's coming over?

00:11:13.485 --> 00:11:16.058
When did he tell you that?

00:11:16.158 --> 00:11:17.293
- Well, actually he didn't

00:11:17.393 --> 00:11:20.099
but I just assumed he was gonna
be here.

00:11:20.199 --> 00:11:21.201
He is, isn't he?

00:11:21.301 --> 00:11:22.638
- No, I don't think so.

00:11:22.738 --> 00:11:24.742
We didn't make any plans anyway.

00:11:24.842 --> 00:11:27.113
(dramatic music)

00:11:27.213 --> 00:11:28.015
- Why not?

00:11:28.115 --> 00:11:28.817
- What do you mean?

00:11:28.917 --> 00:11:30.453
- It's the last night of the
tour?

00:11:30.554 --> 00:11:32.490
Why wouldn't he come over
to see you afterwards?

00:11:32.591 --> 00:11:34.629
It's been a whole month
since he saw you last.

00:11:34.729 --> 00:11:35.998
He's got to come.

00:11:36.098 --> 00:11:37.768
- But they're gonna be partying
all night

00:11:37.868 --> 00:11:39.371
to celebrate the end of the
tour.

00:11:39.471 --> 00:11:41.275
I doubt they're gonna wanna come
over here

00:11:41.375 --> 00:11:42.611
and hang out with us

00:11:42.711 --> 00:11:44.982
- Partying all night.

00:11:45.082 --> 00:11:49.024
No, maybe he'll come over after
the party.

00:11:49.124 --> 00:11:51.094
- No, I don't want you making a
big fuss

00:11:51.194 --> 00:11:51.696
whenever he comes over.

00:11:51.796 --> 00:11:54.100
Besides, having him around
may cramp your style.

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.606
So from now on, we decided
that when we get together,

00:11:56.706 --> 00:11:59.210
we're just gonna go to his
place.

00:11:59.311 --> 00:12:02.651
That way he won't come
busting in here at all hours.

00:12:02.751 --> 00:12:03.586
Huh?

00:12:03.687 --> 00:12:07.594
- No, I was sure Ren would come
to visit Nana after the show

00:12:07.695 --> 00:12:09.364
and then Takumi would come with
him like,

00:12:09.464 --> 00:12:12.705
"Well, if you are going, I
might as well tag along."

00:12:12.805 --> 00:12:14.709
- Hey, are you okay?

00:12:14.809 --> 00:12:16.345
- I thought he'd jump at the
chance.

00:12:16.445 --> 00:12:19.552
Whatever the reason, I
just wanted him to come.

00:12:19.652 --> 00:12:20.787
- Don't let it get you down.

00:12:20.887 --> 00:12:23.760
If you wanna see Ren,
I'll ask him over again.

00:12:25.062 --> 00:12:26.566
He'll have some more time on his
hands

00:12:26.666 --> 00:12:27.601
now that the tour's finished.

00:12:27.701 --> 00:12:30.807
And if you want, I can ask
him to bring Takumi too.

00:12:31.576 --> 00:12:32.578
- No, don't worry about it.

00:12:32.678 --> 00:12:33.813
That's all right.

00:12:33.913 --> 00:12:34.949
- But,

00:12:36.953 --> 00:12:40.126
well, anyway I don't
think he's gonna be coming

00:12:40.226 --> 00:12:40.694
over tonight.

00:12:40.794 --> 00:12:43.900
Sorry, Hachi, you went
to all this trouble.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.771
- It's cool, don't worry about
it.

00:12:45.871 --> 00:12:47.373
I can put all this in the
fridge.

00:12:47.473 --> 00:12:48.877
We'll be set for days.

00:12:48.977 --> 00:12:49.244
What am I doing?

00:12:49.344 --> 00:12:52.083
I feel like such a fool letting
myself get carried away.

00:12:52.183 --> 00:12:53.553
- Hey, not so fast.

00:12:53.653 --> 00:12:56.358
Seeing all this food's
making me totally hungry.

00:12:56.458 --> 00:12:58.362
Is it okay if we eat some of it
now?

00:12:58.462 --> 00:13:00.567
- Sure, of course we can.

00:13:00.667 --> 00:13:02.303
I'll get us some plates.

00:13:02.403 --> 00:13:03.640
- This looks so delicious.

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:04.775
Forget those guys.

00:13:04.875 --> 00:13:06.979
They've got no idea what
they're missing out on.

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:08.482
This is a feast.

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:10.453
Mm, yum.

00:13:10.554 --> 00:13:11.989
(Hachi laughs)

00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:14.461
You know about the
concert tonight,

00:13:14.562 --> 00:13:18.202
you really did wanna go with
everyone else, didn't you?

00:13:18.302 --> 00:13:20.005
It would've been easy
enough to ask Ren

00:13:20.106 --> 00:13:21.743
to put you down on
the guest list.

00:13:21.843 --> 00:13:23.278
I didn't even think about it.

00:13:23.379 --> 00:13:25.116
I can be so dense sometimes.

00:13:25.216 --> 00:13:25.851
I'm sorry.

00:13:25.951 --> 00:13:27.020
- You don't need to be sorry.

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:29.157
I think you wanted to
go more than I did

00:13:29.257 --> 00:13:30.426
but you didn't want to ask.

00:13:30.527 --> 00:13:32.463
Sometimes you can be so
stubborn.

00:13:32.564 --> 00:13:34.835
- I don't know about
being stubborn.

00:13:34.935 --> 00:13:38.142
I'd get too depressed
comparing myself to her.

00:13:38.242 --> 00:13:41.014
I know that sounds lame, but,

00:13:41.114 --> 00:13:41.883
mm, this one's good too.

00:13:41.983 --> 00:13:44.087
You really went all out,
didn't you?

00:13:44.187 --> 00:13:45.724
Mm.

00:13:46.993 --> 00:13:49.130
- I'm the one who's been dense.

00:13:50.132 --> 00:13:51.368
I'm sorry.

00:13:51.468 --> 00:13:53.305
Sorry for bringing you down.

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:57.848
(crowd cheers)

00:13:57.948 --> 00:13:59.652
- Thank you everyone, goodnight.

00:13:59.752 --> 00:14:02.791
(crowd cheers)

00:14:11.576 --> 00:14:12.611
- [Announcer] Ladies and
gentlemen,

00:14:12.711 --> 00:14:14.715
that concludes tonight's
performance.

00:14:14.815 --> 00:14:15.917
Thank you for coming.

00:14:16.017 --> 00:14:20.259
We ask that you please
exit by the back doors.

00:14:31.749 --> 00:14:32.283
- Okay, I'm out of here.

00:14:32.383 --> 00:14:34.955
- What, you mean, you're not
gonna wait with us, Yasu?

00:14:35.055 --> 00:14:36.692
But we've got backstage passes.

00:14:36.793 --> 00:14:38.295
I've got a lot of work to do.

00:14:38.395 --> 00:14:39.364
- Ah, come on, man.

00:14:39.464 --> 00:14:40.934
Hang out with us just for a
while.

00:14:41.034 --> 00:14:43.773
- Sorry guys, say hi
to Ren for me.

00:14:43.873 --> 00:14:45.309
- What about Reira?

00:14:47.046 --> 00:14:50.419
- Tell her congratulations.

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:51.522
- Is that all?

00:14:51.622 --> 00:14:53.325
(Shin laughs)

00:14:53.425 --> 00:14:54.662
- Hey, where's Yasu?

00:14:54.762 --> 00:14:56.465
Why isn't he with you?

00:14:56.566 --> 00:14:58.435
- He said had some work to do

00:14:58.536 --> 00:14:59.805
but he told us to say hi to Ren.

00:14:59.905 --> 00:15:00.841
- What, no hi for me?

00:15:00.941 --> 00:15:02.678
- That sucks, I was really
looking forward

00:15:02.778 --> 00:15:03.746
to hanging out with him again.

00:15:03.847 --> 00:15:05.550
He's such a cool guy.

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:07.453
- Unrequited love now, Naoki?

00:15:07.554 --> 00:15:08.890
- I wanted to see him too.

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:11.027
It's been so long since
we've seen each other.

00:15:11.128 --> 00:15:13.933
Unrequited love, the story
of my life.

00:15:14.033 --> 00:15:16.371
- Reira, do you even
understand what you're saying?

00:15:16.471 --> 00:15:17.774
Tell me you're not serious.

00:15:17.875 --> 00:15:18.610
- Unrequited love, what a story?

00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:20.146
- There's a reporter in here

00:15:20.246 --> 00:15:21.716
and she's writing everything
down.

00:15:21.816 --> 00:15:22.584
(Take laughs)

00:15:22.684 --> 00:15:24.220
Take, it's not funny.

00:15:25.156 --> 00:15:25.489
- Huh?

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:29.397
- Yasu told us to say that
you did a good job tonight.

00:15:29.497 --> 00:15:30.132
- Oh, my God.

00:15:30.232 --> 00:15:32.336
You're the cutest
thing I've ever seen.

00:15:32.436 --> 00:15:34.240
You wanna come play with me?

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:36.378
(all laugh)

00:15:36.478 --> 00:15:37.548
- Sure, but I don't come cheap.

00:15:37.648 --> 00:15:40.286
100,000 yen per night
and you get the worst.

00:15:40.386 --> 00:15:40.921
- Shin, no.

00:15:41.021 --> 00:15:42.524
- You're pretty cute too.

00:15:42.624 --> 00:15:43.492
How much?

00:15:43.593 --> 00:15:44.628
- Ren, what's her deal?

00:15:44.728 --> 00:15:45.429
Help me.

00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:46.031
(Ren laughs)

00:15:46.131 --> 00:15:48.035
Maybe it's better if
I just went home.

00:15:48.135 --> 00:15:50.439
- Oh, come on,
you should join us.

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:51.843
There's a few parties to go to

00:15:51.943 --> 00:15:53.412
so we're gonna be out all night.

00:15:53.513 --> 00:15:54.748
- [Girl] Yay, count me in.

00:15:54.849 --> 00:15:56.519
You're coming with us?

00:15:56.619 --> 00:15:57.821
- [Boy] I'm coming, I'm coming.

00:15:57.921 --> 00:16:01.394
(lighthearted music)

00:16:08.977 --> 00:16:10.346
- [Nobuo] Gin and tonic, please.

00:16:10.446 --> 00:16:11.381
- Nobuo, you all right?

00:16:11.481 --> 00:16:12.651
You're already pretty drunk.

00:16:12.751 --> 00:16:13.820
Maybe you should slow down.

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:16.057
- Nah, I can't take
this crazy scene sober.

00:16:16.157 --> 00:16:18.630
- A fresh young face
and so cute.

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:20.499
(lighthearted music)

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.604
- Why did Yasu go out with that
woman?

00:16:22.704 --> 00:16:23.640
She's so weird.

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:24.842
- I don't think she's weird.

00:16:24.942 --> 00:16:26.378
- Yasu's becoming a man of
mystery.

00:16:26.478 --> 00:16:28.282
- I don't want to hear
you talk like that Reira.

00:16:28.382 --> 00:16:31.789
- Nobuo, calling our
princess a weirdo.

00:16:32.758 --> 00:16:33.993
- Takumi, sorry to interrupt,

00:16:34.093 --> 00:16:35.630
but I need you to sign some
autographs.

00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:36.999
- Autographs, what the hell?

00:16:37.099 --> 00:16:38.235
This is a freaking party.

00:16:38.335 --> 00:16:39.037
I'm off the clock.

00:16:39.137 --> 00:16:41.609
- Sorry, I got the others
to sign after sound check

00:16:41.709 --> 00:16:43.713
but you seemed so busy and I
didn't want to interrupt you.

00:16:43.813 --> 00:16:44.782
And then I was gonna ask you
later

00:16:44.882 --> 00:16:46.619
but I got tied up with
things and I forgot.

00:16:46.719 --> 00:16:48.756
Please, it's for an important
sponsor.

00:16:48.856 --> 00:16:49.758
- Fine, hand them over.

00:16:49.858 --> 00:16:51.696
If it was so important, why'd
you forget?

00:16:51.796 --> 00:16:52.531
- [Takeya] I'm sorry.

00:16:52.631 --> 00:16:54.367
- Just do your job, manager.

00:16:54.467 --> 00:16:56.505
- You're actually
signing them now.

00:16:56.606 --> 00:16:58.141
- I'm no slacker.

00:16:58.242 --> 00:17:00.179
- I've been wondering,
you're the one who does

00:17:00.279 --> 00:17:02.718
the arrangements for the
Trap Nest songs, right?

00:17:02.818 --> 00:17:03.418
- Uh uh.

00:17:03.519 --> 00:17:05.489
- [Shini] And then for the new
album that was just released,

00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:07.326
you were the producer too.

00:17:07.426 --> 00:17:08.095
- Yeah, I was.

00:17:08.195 --> 00:17:10.466
- I guess that explains
why it was so much better

00:17:10.567 --> 00:17:11.569
than the first one.

00:17:11.669 --> 00:17:12.871
- Oh, you really are a cute one.

00:17:12.971 --> 00:17:13.740
How much do I owe you?

00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:14.340
(Shin laughs)

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.244
- Yeah, but seriously, you're
really good.

00:17:16.344 --> 00:17:18.516
- How the hell did you manage
to make such catchy music

00:17:18.616 --> 00:17:21.689
out of Ren's dark twisted songs?

00:17:21.789 --> 00:17:24.662
- Excuse me for writing
dark twisted songs.

00:17:24.762 --> 00:17:25.530
Shochu.

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:26.766
- Yeah, but without Ren's songs,

00:17:26.866 --> 00:17:28.201
there wouldn't even be a band.

00:17:28.302 --> 00:17:30.105
- It's a big schmoozer, stop
sucking up.

00:17:30.205 --> 00:17:32.009
- Oh, Takumi, while you're
signing,

00:17:32.109 --> 00:17:33.846
I need you to do one for me.

00:17:33.947 --> 00:17:35.784
- Sure, you get something
for me to sign on.

00:17:35.884 --> 00:17:37.521
- Of course not, we're at a
party.

00:17:37.621 --> 00:17:38.055
Just use one of these.

00:17:38.155 --> 00:17:41.027
- I don't know, they're for
one of our big sponsors.

00:17:41.127 --> 00:17:41.996
- [Ren] Like I care.

00:17:42.096 --> 00:17:44.133
- He's just like Nana.

00:17:44.233 --> 00:17:45.402
- What's the person's name?

00:17:45.503 --> 00:17:46.939
- Hachiko.
- Uh?

00:17:47.039 --> 00:17:48.710
- [Nobuo] Ren, if
it's for Hachi,

00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:50.012
he should write her real name.

00:17:50.112 --> 00:17:52.684
- [Ren] What is her real name?

00:17:52.784 --> 00:17:55.991
- Hachi, I've heard
that name before.

00:17:56.091 --> 00:17:57.259
- Yeah, you met her
the other day

00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:59.698
when you came over to
play Mahjong with us.

00:17:59.798 --> 00:18:01.034
- Nana Kamatsu.

00:18:01.134 --> 00:18:03.138
- Oh, yeah, I remember.

00:18:05.109 --> 00:18:09.585
Hmm, she doesn't really
want an autograph, does she?

00:18:09.685 --> 00:18:10.419
- Sure she does.

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:12.023
She specifically asked for it.

00:18:12.123 --> 00:18:12.356
- When?

00:18:12.456 --> 00:18:14.695
- The same night we
were playing Mahjong.

00:18:14.795 --> 00:18:18.335
I doubt she wants one now,
I slept with her the next day.

00:18:18.435 --> 00:18:21.776
Where's Takeya, I got
to give him these.

00:18:21.876 --> 00:18:25.917
- Wait a minute, Takumi, what
did you just say you did?

00:18:26.017 --> 00:18:26.886
- Oh, come on.

00:18:26.986 --> 00:18:28.556
You want all the details?

00:18:28.656 --> 00:18:30.593
- She's my girlfriend's
best friend.

00:18:30.694 --> 00:18:31.696
It's one thing to fool around

00:18:31.796 --> 00:18:33.432
but this time you
crossed a line.

00:18:33.533 --> 00:18:34.367
You should have known.

00:18:34.467 --> 00:18:35.970
- Geez man, relax.

00:18:36.071 --> 00:18:37.073
I didn't make her do anything.

00:18:37.173 --> 00:18:39.010
She was up for it.

00:18:40.179 --> 00:18:43.251
She was wagging her tail
like a little puppy.

00:18:43.953 --> 00:18:46.291
(glasses shatter)

00:18:46.391 --> 00:18:49.330
(dramatic music)

00:18:50.165 --> 00:18:51.602
- Hey, you what's going on?

00:18:51.702 --> 00:18:53.071
- It's okay Take, don't worry.

00:18:53.171 --> 00:18:55.309
They're just screwing around.

00:18:56.946 --> 00:18:59.117
- You wanna fight me,
let's take it outside.

00:18:59.217 --> 00:19:01.722
This party's for the staff to
celebrate the end of the tour.

00:19:01.822 --> 00:19:02.858
Don't ruin it.

00:19:02.958 --> 00:19:06.097
(dramatic music)

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:09.805
- Nobuo.

00:19:09.905 --> 00:19:11.575
- Screw this.

00:19:11.675 --> 00:19:13.111
- Smart choice.

00:19:13.713 --> 00:19:14.815
(dramatic music)

00:19:14.915 --> 00:19:16.351
- Hey, Takumi.

00:19:16.451 --> 00:19:19.390
(dramatic music)

00:19:19.992 --> 00:19:21.562
Congratulations.

00:19:21.662 --> 00:19:24.200
(dramatic music)

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:26.204
- The sponsors autograph's ruin.

00:19:26.304 --> 00:19:28.241
- Oh, are you okay, Takumi.

00:19:28.341 --> 00:19:29.545
(Reira laughs)

00:19:29.645 --> 00:19:31.381
- Right on chin, way to go.

00:19:31.481 --> 00:19:32.249
- It's not funny Reira.

00:19:32.349 --> 00:19:34.521
- Calm down, Takumi,
you asked for it.

00:19:34.621 --> 00:19:36.792
- I was just being
honest telling the truth.

00:19:36.892 --> 00:19:37.694
So what's the problem?

00:19:37.794 --> 00:19:42.002
- Come on, you really think
you didn't do anything wrong.

00:19:42.103 --> 00:19:43.305
- I'm leaving too.

00:19:43.405 --> 00:19:43.639
- What?

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:45.844
You can't, we've still got
another party to go to.

00:19:45.944 --> 00:19:47.012
- Well, then go without me.

00:19:47.113 --> 00:19:48.516
- But Takumi, the autographs-

00:19:48.616 --> 00:19:51.187
- I'll sign some more
for you tomorrow, okay?

00:19:51.287 --> 00:19:54.026
I just remembered there's
something I need to do.

00:19:54.127 --> 00:19:54.928
- Like what?

00:19:55.028 --> 00:19:55.764
Another woman.

00:19:55.864 --> 00:19:56.966
- When you see Nobuo,
tell him this,

00:19:57.066 --> 00:19:59.337
he couldn't compete
against me in 100 years.

00:19:59.437 --> 00:20:03.111
He doesn't even have the guts
to ask her out on a date.

00:20:03.211 --> 00:20:06.451
- Well, I agree with the
second part of what you said.

00:20:06.552 --> 00:20:07.486
I'll be sure to tell him

00:20:07.587 --> 00:20:10.593
(dramatic music)

00:20:14.802 --> 00:20:16.839
(door bell ring)

00:20:16.939 --> 00:20:19.678
(door bangs)

00:20:24.955 --> 00:20:25.456
(phone dials)

00:20:25.557 --> 00:20:29.263
- What, it's the middle of the
night.

00:20:31.802 --> 00:20:33.573
Hey, Hachiko, uh.

00:20:38.081 --> 00:20:41.020
(slow music)

00:20:58.756 --> 00:21:03.031
- [Hachiko] Hey Nana, why
is it that making our dreams

00:21:03.131 --> 00:21:05.803
come true and being truly
happier

00:21:05.904 --> 00:21:07.874
are often two separate things?

00:21:07.974 --> 00:21:10.345
(lighthearted music)

00:21:10.445 --> 00:21:14.120
I still haven't figured
that one out.
