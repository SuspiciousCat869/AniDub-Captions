WEBVTT

00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:04.175
(crowd cheering)

00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:12.217
- [Nana] If they couldn't
get signed

00:00:12.317 --> 00:00:14.556
to a record deal after this
performance

00:00:14.656 --> 00:00:17.729
then something must be
seriously wrong with the world.

00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:20.300
("Wish")

00:01:56.794 --> 00:01:58.931
That night was only Blast's
third show

00:01:59.031 --> 00:02:00.768
since they moved to Tokyo,

00:02:00.868 --> 00:02:01.503
it was at the same venue

00:02:01.603 --> 00:02:02.639
as the other gigs.

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:05.377
They were the opening act
and played a 40 minute set.

00:02:05.477 --> 00:02:08.517
(upbeat music)

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.861
- I had no idea Blast was
gonna be this popular.

00:02:13.961 --> 00:02:18.069
The line goes all the way
down to the convenient store.

00:02:18.169 --> 00:02:18.704
- [Nana] We'd arrived early

00:02:18.804 --> 00:02:20.808
because we wanted to
be right at the front.

00:02:20.908 --> 00:02:23.012
And when we Misato to went to
the store to get some juice

00:02:23.112 --> 00:02:25.751
she was excited to see
the huge number of people

00:02:25.852 --> 00:02:26.787
waiting in line.

00:02:26.887 --> 00:02:29.458
- Wow, it sure is a good
thing we got here this early.

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:31.095
Do you think we should
call Kyosuke and Junko

00:02:31.195 --> 00:02:33.534
and tell them to get down
here as soon as they can?

00:02:33.634 --> 00:02:35.838
- I don't think Jun really
wants to be near the front.

00:02:35.938 --> 00:02:37.809
Last time we were here,
she got a little mad

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:40.113
because she was being
squished by the crowd.

00:02:40.213 --> 00:02:40.982
(crowd cheering)

00:02:41.082 --> 00:02:42.952
- Stop pushing or I'm gonna die

00:02:43.052 --> 00:02:45.290
- But that's the best part
of being in the audience

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.192
at a live concert.

00:02:46.292 --> 00:02:47.595
(crowd cheering)
- Yeah, yeah.

00:02:49.198 --> 00:02:51.002
Even back home Blast's concerts

00:02:51.102 --> 00:02:52.471
never got that crazy.

00:02:52.572 --> 00:02:53.541
It was so amazing.

00:02:53.641 --> 00:02:55.443
Almost like I died and gone to
heaven.

00:02:55.545 --> 00:02:59.686
- (laughs) More like you
almost passed out (laughs)

00:02:59.786 --> 00:03:01.957
- [Nana] Even though it
was only their third concert

00:03:02.057 --> 00:03:03.326
they had to the doors early

00:03:03.426 --> 00:03:05.330
because there was such a long
line.

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.169
Right away, the
place was packed.

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.508
- Awesome, awesome, awesome.

00:03:10.608 --> 00:03:13.246
- What'll happen if Jun
and Kyosuke can't get in?

00:03:13.346 --> 00:03:14.215
- What?

00:03:14.315 --> 00:03:15.885
what do you mean it's sold out?

00:03:15.985 --> 00:03:16.753
- Wow.

00:03:16.853 --> 00:03:18.022
No way

00:03:18.122 --> 00:03:19.425
- Everyone's standing anyway.

00:03:19.526 --> 00:03:20.895
Can't you just squeeze
two more in?

00:03:20.995 --> 00:03:23.366
- Sorry, we're already way
over capacity.

00:03:23.466 --> 00:03:24.569
- Isn't there anything
you can do?

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:26.640
Our friends go on at seven.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:27.609
- Oh, you're friends of theirs.

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:28.944
Are you on the guest list?

00:03:29.044 --> 00:03:29.579
- I don't know.

00:03:29.679 --> 00:03:30.480
- What are your names?

00:03:30.581 --> 00:03:31.850
- Saotome and Takakura.

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:32.417
- Hmm...

00:03:32.518 --> 00:03:33.386
- Oh yeah.

00:03:33.486 --> 00:03:34.255
- It's all right.

00:03:34.355 --> 00:03:35.290
I'll deal with it.

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.427
You don't mind standing
at the back dude.

00:03:37.528 --> 00:03:39.833
- Hey, I hope you bought
your tickets in advance.

00:03:39.933 --> 00:03:40.601
- No

00:03:40.701 --> 00:03:42.070
- Then you can't come in.

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.872
We're sold out.

00:03:42.972 --> 00:03:44.141
- Oh

00:03:44.241 --> 00:03:44.743
No way.

00:03:44.843 --> 00:03:46.279
We came to Tokyo especially

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:47.615
so we could see Blast in
concert.

00:03:47.715 --> 00:03:48.617
It can't be sold out.

00:03:48.717 --> 00:03:50.387
- I told you we should
have left earlier,

00:03:50.487 --> 00:03:50.988
but oh no.

00:03:51.088 --> 00:03:52.692
- You were the one who
insisted on going

00:03:52.792 --> 00:03:53.827
to your Summer school class.

00:03:53.928 --> 00:03:55.463
- The teacher said you
wouldn't let me graduate

00:03:55.565 --> 00:03:57.134
unless went to that
stupid class.

00:03:57.234 --> 00:03:57.735
- Oh yeah?

00:03:57.835 --> 00:03:58.938
Well maybe you should have
studied harder

00:03:59.038 --> 00:04:00.073
in the first place.

00:04:00.173 --> 00:04:00.675
I'm begging you

00:04:00.775 --> 00:04:02.411
please you gotta let us in.

00:04:02.512 --> 00:04:04.616
- No, if we go anymore over
capacity,

00:04:04.716 --> 00:04:05.116
people could get hurt.

00:04:05.216 --> 00:04:07.487
Your life's more important
than a show, right?

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:08.389
- No way man.

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:09.224
This show is important.

00:04:09.325 --> 00:04:09.993
- Well, I still say no.

00:04:10.093 --> 00:04:12.030
- (crying) No, no.

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:13.433
- Crying ain't gonna help.

00:04:13.534 --> 00:04:17.007
- Hey, listen why don't
you let the girls go in

00:04:17.107 --> 00:04:17.875
instead of us.

00:04:17.976 --> 00:04:19.011
We don't mind

00:04:20.213 --> 00:04:21.817
- [Nana] With each
show that Blast played

00:04:21.917 --> 00:04:24.421
the audience's enthusiasm
increased

00:04:24.522 --> 00:04:27.227
and it made me feel almost
drunk.

00:04:27.327 --> 00:04:29.098
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

00:04:29.198 --> 00:04:30.333
- It's no problem.

00:04:30.433 --> 00:04:32.237
- Excuse me.

00:04:32.337 --> 00:04:33.641
- We scored getting in like
this.

00:04:33.741 --> 00:04:34.776
Imagine if we spent all that
money

00:04:34.876 --> 00:04:37.247
on those freaking expensive
plane tickets for nothing.

00:04:37.347 --> 00:04:37.782
- I know.

00:04:37.882 --> 00:04:41.222
I didn't think people in
Tokyo could be that nice.

00:04:41.322 --> 00:04:42.491
I wish we could get down there,

00:04:42.592 --> 00:04:43.794
but even the stairs are packed.

00:04:43.894 --> 00:04:45.063
We'd never make it through the
crowd.

00:04:45.163 --> 00:04:47.502
- At least we're gonna get
a great view from up here.

00:04:47.602 --> 00:04:49.004
And there's no danger
of us getting crushed.

00:04:49.104 --> 00:04:51.543
- What's up with all these
people being here so early.

00:04:51.643 --> 00:04:52.679
It's unbelievable.

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:54.415
- It's only because they're so
awesome.

00:04:54.516 --> 00:04:55.283
- But you know,

00:04:55.383 --> 00:04:56.285
it makes me kind of sad.

00:04:56.385 --> 00:04:57.154
Now that they're so big.

00:04:57.254 --> 00:04:58.724
Nana might forget about us.

00:04:58.824 --> 00:04:59.826
- She won't forget us.

00:04:59.926 --> 00:05:01.062
She always sends me a card

00:05:01.162 --> 00:05:02.699
to let me know when
there's a gig coming up.

00:05:02.799 --> 00:05:04.669
- That was a smart move
to give her your address

00:05:04.769 --> 00:05:05.571
when you saw her.

00:05:05.671 --> 00:05:08.476
Okay, next time we'll
both skip school and work.

00:05:08.577 --> 00:05:09.445
We won't miss a show.

00:05:09.546 --> 00:05:11.349
Even if it means we have to
hitchhike.

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:11.984
- Totally.

00:05:12.084 --> 00:05:14.622
We'll even camp out on the
street.

00:05:14.723 --> 00:05:16.092
It'll be worth it.

00:05:16.192 --> 00:05:20.668
They give us energy to
deal with life, don't they?

00:05:20.768 --> 00:05:23.072
- [Nana] The show started
at seven o'clock sharp.

00:05:23.172 --> 00:05:26.513
And the first one to
appear on stage was Nana.

00:05:26.613 --> 00:05:32.024
(metal music)
(crowd cheering)

00:05:40.741 --> 00:05:43.012
- [Nana] The cheering
got louder and louder

00:05:43.112 --> 00:05:44.616
with every song.

00:05:44.716 --> 00:05:46.352
And I was in the middle of it.

00:05:46.452 --> 00:05:48.389
I felt like I disappear in it.

00:05:48.489 --> 00:05:51.897
(crowd cheering)
- Hello everybody.

00:05:51.997 --> 00:05:53.466
We're Blast.

00:05:53.567 --> 00:05:56.540
(metal music)

00:05:57.207 --> 00:05:57.709
- Damn!

00:05:57.809 --> 00:05:58.744
The show's starting already.

00:05:58.844 --> 00:05:59.846
- Dude, it's so loud.

00:05:59.946 --> 00:06:01.415
We can hear them from out here.

00:06:01.516 --> 00:06:02.618
- I want to go in so bad.

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:04.421
- Blast needs to play in a
bigger place.

00:06:04.522 --> 00:06:07.194
Don't they know many
fans they got in Tokyo?

00:06:08.864 --> 00:06:12.371
- Ugh, I knew we should
have bought our tickets

00:06:12.471 --> 00:06:13.574
ahead of time.

00:06:13.674 --> 00:06:14.676
- Let's wait for them to come
out.

00:06:14.776 --> 00:06:16.445
- Oh, who do you wanna see?

00:06:16.546 --> 00:06:17.280
- Yasu.

00:06:17.381 --> 00:06:18.617
He's got great technique.

00:06:18.717 --> 00:06:19.519
- Hands off.

00:06:19.619 --> 00:06:21.389
Yasu's the one I want.

00:06:21.489 --> 00:06:23.527
- It's because of Summer
vacation.

00:06:23.627 --> 00:06:24.863
That's why there's so many
people

00:06:24.963 --> 00:06:26.232
from out of town here for the
show.

00:06:26.332 --> 00:06:29.572
- Yeah, but still this much
enthusiasm is pure insanity.

00:06:29.672 --> 00:06:30.875
What the hell's going on?

00:06:30.975 --> 00:06:31.743
- What do you want to do?

00:06:31.843 --> 00:06:34.582
Go somewhere and get a
drink till the show's over?

00:06:34.682 --> 00:06:35.250
- Why not?

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.120
Now that we're here we
might as well stick around.

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.258
Then we can at least
say hi to Nana.

00:06:39.358 --> 00:06:41.162
- If they've got that
many people following them

00:06:41.262 --> 00:06:43.499
they should have no
problem getting signed.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:44.435
- That's it.

00:06:44.536 --> 00:06:45.036
Their followers.

00:06:45.136 --> 00:06:46.840
Misato's one of the that's for
sure.

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.276
And Nana's kind of like that

00:06:48.376 --> 00:06:49.646
towards her roommate, isn't she?

00:06:49.746 --> 00:06:51.516
- Yeah, definitely.

00:06:51.616 --> 00:06:53.052
- Maybe the reason she
doesn't talk about

00:06:53.152 --> 00:06:54.154
the demon Lord anymore is
because

00:06:54.254 --> 00:06:56.860
she's converted over
to the religion of Blast.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.362
She's become completely
obsessed with them.

00:06:58.463 --> 00:07:00.768
- (laughs) Well, at
least she's more positive

00:07:00.868 --> 00:07:01.402
about life now than she was

00:07:01.503 --> 00:07:05.009
back when she used to blame
everything on the demon Lord.

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:07.180
Besides Blast's a pretty
cool band.

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.953
I can see why they're inspiring
such a devoted following.

00:07:10.053 --> 00:07:11.455
Not only is their music good

00:07:11.556 --> 00:07:13.259
but they've got great
stage presence.

00:07:13.359 --> 00:07:13.794
- Absolutely.

00:07:13.894 --> 00:07:16.232
When Nana sings, it's like
she's a guru.

00:07:16.332 --> 00:07:19.071
(soft music)

00:07:20.775 --> 00:07:22.779
But you know, I have to wonder

00:07:22.879 --> 00:07:24.281
there are a lot of great
bands out there,

00:07:24.381 --> 00:07:27.120
but that doesn't mean
they're guaranteed success.

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:29.959
Of course, if you wanna
get signed by a major label

00:07:30.059 --> 00:07:32.497
you have to perform at
a certain level.

00:07:32.598 --> 00:07:33.232
But from that point on,

00:07:33.332 --> 00:07:35.604
it's not really about
how well you can play.

00:07:35.704 --> 00:07:38.644
(soft music)

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:46.125
- Charisma, you guys definitely
have it.

00:07:46.225 --> 00:07:49.164
Not only do you have some
exceptionally good songs,

00:07:49.264 --> 00:07:50.534
you perform them well.

00:07:50.634 --> 00:07:52.572
It was an amazing show.

00:07:52.672 --> 00:07:54.374
I've been in this business
for a long time

00:07:54.475 --> 00:07:57.013
but it's been many years
since I've come across a band

00:07:57.113 --> 00:07:58.282
that's impressed me this much

00:07:58.382 --> 00:07:59.953
so early in their career.

00:08:00.053 --> 00:08:03.594
Well, there's a lot of
business we need to discuss.

00:08:03.694 --> 00:08:05.898
But instead of going over all
that here,

00:08:05.998 --> 00:08:07.568
why don't I take you out for
sushi?

00:08:07.668 --> 00:08:09.137
- Huh?

00:08:09.238 --> 00:08:11.108
- Sushi count me in.

00:08:12.344 --> 00:08:14.214
- Shin.

00:08:14.314 --> 00:08:16.520
(Mr. Kawano laughs)

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:17.655
(engine revs softly)

00:08:17.755 --> 00:08:18.122
- What?

00:08:18.222 --> 00:08:20.928
You didn't even go
backstage after the show?

00:08:21.028 --> 00:08:21.596
- No.

00:08:21.696 --> 00:08:22.698
There was this guy from a record
company

00:08:22.798 --> 00:08:23.567
who wanted to talk to them.

00:08:23.667 --> 00:08:24.468
So he didn't wanna get in the
way.

00:08:24.569 --> 00:08:27.307
And besides we'll be seeing
everyone at home later on.

00:08:27.407 --> 00:08:28.242
- Oh, an after party?

00:08:28.342 --> 00:08:30.213
- I guess that means you
want me to take you straight

00:08:30.313 --> 00:08:31.115
to your place.

00:08:31.215 --> 00:08:31.716
- Yeah.

00:08:31.816 --> 00:08:33.085
I made lots of really good food
today

00:08:33.186 --> 00:08:35.858
because I knew we were going
to be celebrating for sure.

00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.528
You're both welcome to join us.

00:08:37.628 --> 00:08:39.031
- Ah, sorry.

00:08:39.131 --> 00:08:39.632
- Huh?

00:08:39.732 --> 00:08:42.304
- It's kind of a busy
time for us right now.

00:08:42.404 --> 00:08:43.540
So we should be getting home.

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:44.408
- But why?

00:08:44.509 --> 00:08:45.310
What are you doing?

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:46.212
It's Summer vacation.

00:08:46.312 --> 00:08:48.482
- We're getting ready for a
group exhibition next week.

00:08:48.584 --> 00:08:51.455
Six of us from art school
have decided to a gallery.

00:08:51.556 --> 00:08:54.896
So we've gotta make sure
everything's finished by then.

00:08:54.996 --> 00:08:56.465
- A group exhibition.

00:08:56.566 --> 00:08:57.935
That sounds cool.

00:08:58.035 --> 00:08:59.906
Art students are so arty.

00:09:00.006 --> 00:09:01.342
- You guys came out tonight,

00:09:01.442 --> 00:09:02.377
even though you're really busy.

00:09:02.477 --> 00:09:04.515
It's too bad that you
couldn't get into the show.

00:09:04.616 --> 00:09:07.053
- Not as bad as those people
who came from out of town

00:09:07.153 --> 00:09:09.358
especially to see the
show and couldn't get in

00:09:09.458 --> 00:09:11.462
- True that.

00:09:11.563 --> 00:09:11.963
- Here.

00:09:12.063 --> 00:09:14.067
This is a flyer that has all
the info on the exhibition.

00:09:14.167 --> 00:09:16.773
I hope you can swing
by and see it.

00:09:16.873 --> 00:09:19.746
- [Nana] Friends in the same
major.

00:09:19.846 --> 00:09:22.718
All of them pursuing
their dreams.

00:09:25.089 --> 00:09:29.298
I feel more and more like
I'm getting left behind.

00:09:29.398 --> 00:09:30.801
(microwave timer dings)

00:09:30.901 --> 00:09:32.939
(phone rings)
- Oh, Miss Hachiko,

00:09:33.039 --> 00:09:33.807
it's your cell phone.

00:09:33.907 --> 00:09:35.143
It's ringing.

00:09:37.347 --> 00:09:38.482
- Hello, this is Nana.

00:09:38.584 --> 00:09:39.519
Oh, hi Nana.

00:09:39.619 --> 00:09:40.119
How's it going?

00:09:40.219 --> 00:09:41.556
Great job with the concert.

00:09:41.656 --> 00:09:43.694
We're back at home now.

00:09:43.794 --> 00:09:45.764
Yeah, we managed to get a ride.

00:09:45.864 --> 00:09:46.566
What about you?

00:09:46.666 --> 00:09:48.102
When are you gonna be home?

00:09:48.202 --> 00:09:48.804
- Sorry Hachi,

00:09:48.904 --> 00:09:50.774
but I don't think we're
gonna be able to make it.

00:09:50.874 --> 00:09:52.812
The guy from Gaia wants
to take us out to dinner

00:09:52.912 --> 00:09:53.780
to talk business

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.452
and it's probably gonna
take a while.

00:09:57.588 --> 00:09:58.356
- Oh.

00:09:58.456 --> 00:10:01.428
- Oh, you didn't already make
stuff for an after party.

00:10:01.529 --> 00:10:02.197
Did you?

00:10:02.297 --> 00:10:02.932
- Not yet.

00:10:03.032 --> 00:10:04.969
We just got home a minute ago.

00:10:05.069 --> 00:10:06.506
- I'm really sorry.

00:10:07.307 --> 00:10:08.744
- It'll be okay.

00:10:08.844 --> 00:10:09.712
It's fine.

00:10:09.812 --> 00:10:10.714
Don't worry about us.

00:10:10.814 --> 00:10:12.217
You go out and have fun.

00:10:12.317 --> 00:10:15.023
- [Nana] Why does
this always happen to me?

00:10:15.123 --> 00:10:15.958
- I've gotta work tomorrow night

00:10:16.058 --> 00:10:18.764
but I can stop by some time
in the afternoon to see you.

00:10:18.864 --> 00:10:19.599
Will you be around?

00:10:19.699 --> 00:10:20.400
- I'm working during the day

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:22.672
so I don't think I can
make it back in time.

00:10:22.772 --> 00:10:23.874
- What about Misato?

00:10:23.974 --> 00:10:25.376
Let me talk to her.

00:10:26.278 --> 00:10:27.347
- It's Nana.

00:10:28.349 --> 00:10:29.919
- Hi, Nana.

00:10:30.019 --> 00:10:31.756
Yeah, I loved the show.

00:10:31.856 --> 00:10:33.292
You guys were awesome.

00:10:34.595 --> 00:10:35.798
- Huh?

00:10:36.398 --> 00:10:37.802
- Oh really?

00:10:38.503 --> 00:10:39.071
No.

00:10:39.171 --> 00:10:42.243
I just hope he talks to
you guys about a contract.

00:10:43.112 --> 00:10:43.613
Yeah?

00:10:43.714 --> 00:10:45.016
Tomorrow?

00:10:45.951 --> 00:10:47.521
- [Nana] What about me?

00:10:47.621 --> 00:10:48.289
- Yes, of course.

00:10:48.389 --> 00:10:51.896
I'll be waiting for you
here at the apartment.

00:10:51.997 --> 00:10:55.370
[Nana] Nana, what about me?

00:11:00.914 --> 00:11:02.250
- Nana, we need to get going.

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:04.087
Mr. Kawano's called a taxi for
us

00:11:04.187 --> 00:11:06.325
and it's already waiting out
back, hurry.

00:11:06.425 --> 00:11:07.360
Oh, sorry.

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:08.730
You're on the phone.

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:09.666
- Sorry, Misato.

00:11:09.766 --> 00:11:10.333
I've got a go now.

00:11:10.433 --> 00:11:13.272
Tell Hachiko I said goodbye,
okay.

00:11:13.372 --> 00:11:14.642
What?

00:11:14.742 --> 00:11:15.778
No it's no problem.

00:11:15.878 --> 00:11:16.311
Go ahead.

00:11:16.412 --> 00:11:18.015
Of course you can
sleep in my room.

00:11:18.115 --> 00:11:19.451
The door's not locked.

00:11:19.552 --> 00:11:20.453
Mm-hmm.

00:11:20.554 --> 00:11:21.823
Bye.

00:11:22.658 --> 00:11:23.894
- Misato?

00:11:23.994 --> 00:11:25.496
What about Hachi?

00:11:25.597 --> 00:11:27.067
- She said don't worry.

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:30.206
- You know, we could always call
them back

00:11:30.306 --> 00:11:32.477
and invite them to
join us for sushi.

00:11:32.578 --> 00:11:34.448
- You idiot let's go.

00:11:35.383 --> 00:11:35.884
- Idiot?

00:11:35.984 --> 00:11:39.625
(crowd chattering)

00:11:39.726 --> 00:11:40.894
- Hey, good job you guys.

00:11:40.994 --> 00:11:44.502
(crowd cheers)
- Nana.

00:11:47.975 --> 00:11:50.113
- Nana your songs give me
courage

00:11:50.213 --> 00:11:52.952
to get through the day.

00:11:53.052 --> 00:11:56.993
- [Nana] No wonder Nana
likes Misato more than me.

00:11:57.093 --> 00:11:59.097
It's because she's obsessed with
Nana

00:11:59.197 --> 00:12:02.270
and comes to Tokyo
for every show.

00:12:03.239 --> 00:12:04.174
Of course a power dinner

00:12:04.274 --> 00:12:07.280
with a record company
takes preference over me.

00:12:08.349 --> 00:12:10.052
And of course she'd rather live

00:12:10.153 --> 00:12:12.390
with her boyfriend than with me.

00:12:15.062 --> 00:12:17.535
It all makes sense.

00:12:17.635 --> 00:12:21.241
But if that really is true

00:12:21.341 --> 00:12:24.314
then she doesn't
need me anymore.

00:12:24.414 --> 00:12:25.049
- It's too bad.

00:12:25.149 --> 00:12:26.385
Isn't it Miss Hachiko?

00:12:26.485 --> 00:12:28.890
Especially after you made
all this wonderful food

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:29.859
for everyone.

00:12:29.959 --> 00:12:31.529
- What?

00:12:31.629 --> 00:12:33.432
Oh, it can't be helped.

00:12:33.533 --> 00:12:34.869
These things happen.

00:12:34.969 --> 00:12:35.470
If you're not hungry,

00:12:35.571 --> 00:12:37.073
don't force yourself to eat,
okay.

00:12:37.173 --> 00:12:38.577
- But it all looks so delicious.

00:12:38.677 --> 00:12:40.079
I wanna try a bit of everything.

00:12:40.179 --> 00:12:42.150
I can't believe you
made all this yourself.

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:43.587
You're an amazing chef.

00:12:43.687 --> 00:12:45.757
I'm totally impressed.

00:12:45.858 --> 00:12:47.060
Mmh.

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.565
- [Nana] Misato's such a
nice girl.

00:12:50.901 --> 00:12:52.237
Even though she's obsessed with
Nana

00:12:52.337 --> 00:12:55.176
she doesn't get jealous or
possessive

00:12:55.276 --> 00:12:56.478
and she was genuinely happy

00:12:56.579 --> 00:13:00.019
about Nana and Ren getting
back together again.

00:13:00.119 --> 00:13:02.958
She's just a very sweet girl.

00:13:03.058 --> 00:13:06.265
It makes my own selfish
feeling stand out.

00:13:06.365 --> 00:13:09.972
I wonder if I can handle living
with her for a whole month.

00:13:13.112 --> 00:13:16.185
(phone beeping)

00:13:23.032 --> 00:13:24.836
This is kind of like brushing
him off

00:13:24.936 --> 00:13:26.873
until the end of Summer.

00:13:26.973 --> 00:13:28.442
I guess that's okay, isn't it.

00:13:28.543 --> 00:13:32.317
I'm not sure if I'll ever
see him again anyway.

00:13:33.987 --> 00:13:36.058
I won't see Nobuo either.

00:13:36.158 --> 00:13:37.995
I know he was up on stage
tonight

00:13:38.095 --> 00:13:40.066
but I avoided looking at him.

00:13:41.068 --> 00:13:44.007
(soft music)

00:13:50.754 --> 00:13:51.990
Nana.

00:13:59.605 --> 00:14:00.674
This isn't good.

00:14:00.774 --> 00:14:01.943
What am I gonna do?

00:14:02.043 --> 00:14:04.381
I feel so lonely.

00:14:04.481 --> 00:14:07.253
(phone rings)

00:14:12.163 --> 00:14:15.336
- The friend you've got
staying with you, is it a girl?

00:14:17.073 --> 00:14:18.743
- Yes, of course it is.

00:14:18.843 --> 00:14:19.579
- Good.

00:14:19.679 --> 00:14:20.781
Glad to hear it.

00:14:20.881 --> 00:14:21.616
Goodnight Nana.

00:14:21.716 --> 00:14:25.122
(phone disconnects)

00:14:31.235 --> 00:14:34.207
(phone rings)

00:14:35.844 --> 00:14:36.679
- Yeah.

00:14:36.779 --> 00:14:40.721
- Takumi, I wanna see you.

00:14:40.821 --> 00:14:43.660
(upbeat music)

00:14:46.198 --> 00:14:46.666
- Oh, hi Miss Hachiko.

00:14:46.766 --> 00:14:49.471
Thank you for letting me use
your bathtub.

00:14:49.572 --> 00:14:50.239
- Sorry Misato.

00:14:50.339 --> 00:14:52.310
But I gotta go out for a while,
okay?

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:52.912
What?

00:14:53.012 --> 00:14:53.880
But it's so late.

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:54.782
Did something happen?

00:14:54.882 --> 00:14:55.617
Are you okay?

00:14:55.717 --> 00:14:56.351
- I'm fine.

00:14:56.451 --> 00:14:57.487
It's nothing important, really.

00:14:57.588 --> 00:14:59.090
But I won't be coming back
tonight.

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:01.061
I'll just go straight
to work in the morning.

00:15:01.161 --> 00:15:02.130
I'll leave my key with you

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:03.065
so when you go out,

00:15:03.165 --> 00:15:05.436
you can just leave it in the
mailbox.

00:15:07.708 --> 00:15:10.781
- [Nana] Sorry for
leaving you on your own.

00:15:10.881 --> 00:15:12.685
But I had to go.

00:15:12.785 --> 00:15:15.924
Otherwise I'd never have
made it through the night.

00:15:16.024 --> 00:15:17.226
- Okay, that's it for tonight.

00:15:17.327 --> 00:15:19.197
I'll come and pick you
up in the morning at ten.

00:15:19.297 --> 00:15:20.901
You better not leave this room
until then

00:15:21.001 --> 00:15:21.636
or there'll be trouble.

00:15:21.736 --> 00:15:24.140
- I'll be here Take, don't
worry.

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:24.742
Hey, could you swing by my place

00:15:24.842 --> 00:15:26.613
and bring a change of clothes
with you?

00:15:26.713 --> 00:15:27.715
- Sure.

00:15:34.729 --> 00:15:36.498
- Huh?

00:15:36.599 --> 00:15:38.903
- Sorry to keep you waiting,
Reira.

00:15:39.004 --> 00:15:40.406
You ready?

00:15:40.507 --> 00:15:41.576
- Take?

00:15:41.676 --> 00:15:42.076
- Yeah.

00:15:42.176 --> 00:15:43.513
- Can you get me a room at the
hotel too?

00:15:43.613 --> 00:15:46.051
All this driving around
has made me car sick.

00:15:46.151 --> 00:15:49.892
(slow music)

00:15:49.992 --> 00:15:52.731
- The meter's getting pretty
high.

00:15:52.831 --> 00:15:53.365
By the time I get there,

00:15:53.465 --> 00:15:55.504
it'll cost me whatever I make
tomorrow.

00:15:55.604 --> 00:15:58.375
(phone rings)

00:16:08.228 --> 00:16:11.468
That means this isn't
gonna be the last time.

00:16:11.569 --> 00:16:13.840
- No but how come all the
fans wanted to talk with you

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:14.842
and not me?

00:16:14.942 --> 00:16:17.681
- I don't know how we can
thank you enough, Mr Kawano.

00:16:17.781 --> 00:16:19.484
You treated us to an excellent
meal.

00:16:19.585 --> 00:16:22.123
- How about another round
of drinks someplace nearby?

00:16:22.223 --> 00:16:22.758
- Thanks.

00:16:22.858 --> 00:16:24.662
But I've got a busy day at work
tomorrow.

00:16:24.762 --> 00:16:25.229
- Right.

00:16:25.329 --> 00:16:26.331
Someone told me you've been
working

00:16:26.431 --> 00:16:27.668
for one of the big law firms.

00:16:27.768 --> 00:16:30.473
What are you gonna do about
that when the band takes off?

00:16:30.574 --> 00:16:32.410
- Well, that's another
thing I have to consider

00:16:32.511 --> 00:16:33.913
along with the contract.

00:16:34.014 --> 00:16:34.347
- I see.

00:16:34.447 --> 00:16:37.220
Then I look forward to your
decision.

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:39.491
- Yasu, I think I'm
gonna take a cab

00:16:39.592 --> 00:16:42.330
with Nobuo and Shin, okay?

00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:44.502
Hachiko's gonna be
working all day tomorrow.

00:16:44.602 --> 00:16:46.806
So, I thought I'd swing
by and see her tonight.

00:16:46.906 --> 00:16:47.675
- Sure.

00:16:47.775 --> 00:16:48.610
Sounds like a good idea.

00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:52.283
Tell her I'm sorry we couldn't
make it to our after party.

00:16:54.989 --> 00:16:58.730
- Mr. Kawano seems too laid
back for a big shot music exec.

00:16:58.830 --> 00:16:59.364
Don't you think?

00:16:59.464 --> 00:17:02.036
With him it could take a hundred
years to release an album.

00:17:02.136 --> 00:17:02.571
- Yeah.

00:17:02.671 --> 00:17:05.476
And I wonder if he even knows
anything about punk music.

00:17:05.577 --> 00:17:06.746
Sure he said he was impressed,

00:17:06.846 --> 00:17:08.215
but what if he doesn't
know what he's doing?

00:17:08.315 --> 00:17:11.823
(Nobuo laughs) Still,
he did give us cab fare.

00:17:11.923 --> 00:17:13.560
So he must be a good guy.
(Shin's phone rings)

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:15.463
- I don't know if paying
for somebody's cab

00:17:15.564 --> 00:17:17.033
is enough to make them a good
guy.

00:17:17.133 --> 00:17:20.172
- (chuckles) He gave us
too much, wanna split it?

00:17:20.272 --> 00:17:21.976
- Excuse me, stop right here.

00:17:22.076 --> 00:17:25.383
(car screeches)

00:17:25.483 --> 00:17:26.753
- What are you doing?

00:17:26.853 --> 00:17:27.387
- Business?

00:17:27.487 --> 00:17:29.424
I don't know how you got the
energy.

00:17:29.525 --> 00:17:30.861
- Say hi to Hachi for me.

00:17:30.961 --> 00:17:31.963
Will you Nobuo?

00:17:36.471 --> 00:17:38.108
- You coming to see Hachi too?

00:17:38.208 --> 00:17:39.310
- Wasn't planning on it.

00:17:39.411 --> 00:17:40.312
I've given up on her.

00:17:40.413 --> 00:17:41.849
Besides I'm a popular guy

00:17:41.949 --> 00:17:43.853
there's plenty of girls
who want to be with me.

00:17:43.953 --> 00:17:46.692
- You'd stand a better chance
if you grew your hair long.

00:17:46.793 --> 00:17:49.197
- I don't wanna win her
over with a hairstyle.

00:17:49.297 --> 00:17:50.433
- Yeah, you wouldn't look good.

00:17:50.534 --> 00:17:52.336
- Then don't suggest it.

00:17:58.048 --> 00:17:58.750
- Surprise!

00:17:58.850 --> 00:17:59.484
I'm home.

00:17:59.585 --> 00:18:00.854
- Oh, hi, hi, hi, hi.

00:18:01.722 --> 00:18:03.092
- Hope I didn't wake you.

00:18:03.192 --> 00:18:06.732
I had to knock because I left
my key at a friend's place.

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:08.068
- Oh, it's fine.

00:18:08.168 --> 00:18:09.170
I hadn't gone to bed yet.

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:10.072
- What about Hachi?

00:18:10.172 --> 00:18:10.974
Is she asleep?

00:18:11.074 --> 00:18:11.809
- Um...

00:18:11.909 --> 00:18:13.212
- Huh?

00:18:13.312 --> 00:18:14.247
- Hachi's not here right now.

00:18:14.347 --> 00:18:15.349
She left an hour ago.

00:18:15.449 --> 00:18:17.353
- Where the hell could
she go this late at night?

00:18:17.453 --> 00:18:18.890
- I don't know.

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:19.959
But she kind of left in a hurry

00:18:20.059 --> 00:18:23.365
and she told me she wasn't
gonna be back tonight.

00:18:27.473 --> 00:18:28.643
I hope it wasn't my fault.

00:18:28.743 --> 00:18:30.781
Maybe I did something
to upset her.

00:18:30.881 --> 00:18:32.016
- No, it's not that.

00:18:32.116 --> 00:18:32.818
It's more like some guy.

00:18:32.918 --> 00:18:35.022
She probably went to
see her boyfriend.

00:18:35.122 --> 00:18:35.891
That's all.

00:18:35.991 --> 00:18:36.759
Don't worry about it.

00:18:36.859 --> 00:18:37.460
- Huh?

00:18:37.561 --> 00:18:38.262
Any beer in the fridge?

00:18:38.362 --> 00:18:39.698
- Oh, yeah.

00:18:40.299 --> 00:18:41.334
Oh wow.

00:18:41.434 --> 00:18:43.071
I never knew Hachiko had a
boyfriend.

00:18:43.172 --> 00:18:45.342
- (laughs) You're surprised
she actually has one?

00:18:45.442 --> 00:18:46.579
- Well yeah.

00:18:46.679 --> 00:18:48.850
- Well yeah, she says (laughs)

00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:49.618
- Because to be honest,

00:18:49.718 --> 00:18:52.423
I thought she was only in love
with you.

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:55.396
- Get real that's impossible.

00:18:55.496 --> 00:18:57.668
- But Nana you're the only
one I love.

00:18:57.768 --> 00:18:59.270
So please don't tell me it's
impossible.

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:01.843
Because then I don't
know what I'd do.

00:19:02.911 --> 00:19:04.715
- I'm sorry Misato.

00:19:04.815 --> 00:19:05.817
- Huh?

00:19:07.019 --> 00:19:08.021
What's this?

00:19:08.121 --> 00:19:08.923
- Oh, it's a microwave.

00:19:09.023 --> 00:19:10.794
- I know that, but what's it
doing here?

00:19:10.894 --> 00:19:12.564
- She said she bought it on
credit.

00:19:12.664 --> 00:19:15.469
Apparently that was the
only place she could put it.

00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:16.639
- If she's gonna buy stuff,

00:19:16.739 --> 00:19:18.676
Why didn't she buy an air
conditioner?

00:19:18.776 --> 00:19:22.684
Oh geez Hachiko (Misato laughs)

00:19:22.784 --> 00:19:25.524
(soft music)

00:19:31.769 --> 00:19:35.176
Hey, how come the fridge
is all packed full of food?

00:19:35.276 --> 00:19:36.077
Do you know?

00:19:36.178 --> 00:19:38.215
- Yeah, I do.

00:19:38.315 --> 00:19:39.985
Hachi prepared it all.

00:19:40.085 --> 00:19:42.190
She thought you were
coming over with the band

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:43.325
once the show was finished.

00:19:43.425 --> 00:19:46.699
so she made all this stuff to
celebrate.

00:19:46.799 --> 00:19:49.070
- You didn't already make
stuff for an after party.

00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:49.905
Did you?

00:19:50.005 --> 00:19:50.607
- Don't worry about us.

00:19:50.707 --> 00:19:52.578
You go out and have fun.

00:19:56.986 --> 00:19:58.388
- I'm sorry.

00:19:58.488 --> 00:19:59.357
- Don't be sorry, Nana.

00:19:59.457 --> 00:20:01.161
It's not your fault.

00:20:01.261 --> 00:20:03.165
Anyway, how was your meeting

00:20:03.265 --> 00:20:05.837
with the guy from the record
company?

00:20:05.937 --> 00:20:08.676
(soft music)

00:20:22.871 --> 00:20:27.881
- Hey Nana, if you
and I were lovers

00:20:27.981 --> 00:20:29.985
would we have been able
to fill the emptiness

00:20:30.085 --> 00:20:31.689
by holding each other?

00:20:35.864 --> 00:20:37.568
(upbeat music)

00:20:37.668 --> 00:20:42.844
Or does everyone to bear this
loneliness in their life?

00:20:52.731 --> 00:20:56.438
(Shin and Reira laugh)

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:07.894
It's not that I wanted to
keep you all to myself Nana,

00:21:09.464 --> 00:21:11.669
I just wanted you to need me.
