WEBVTT

00:00:04.217 --> 00:00:05.486
- [Nana] I knew
the time had come

00:00:05.587 --> 00:00:06.689
for me to face the problem

00:00:06.789 --> 00:00:09.160
that I'd been ignoring all
along.

00:00:10.564 --> 00:00:12.868
I was in total denial,

00:00:12.968 --> 00:00:15.607
and was only deceiving myself.

00:00:15.707 --> 00:00:18.546
(upbeat music)

00:01:57.043 --> 00:01:58.980
(computer keys rattling)

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.220
(birds chirping)

00:02:10.871 --> 00:02:13.510
(bedding ruffling)

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.116
(Nana Komatsu yawning)

00:02:18.152 --> 00:02:21.291
(birds chirping)

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.205
- Why does being pregnant
make me so sleepy?

00:02:29.274 --> 00:02:31.178
(Komatsu shrieking)

00:02:31.278 --> 00:02:34.752
(gentle piano music)

00:02:48.078 --> 00:02:51.519
(phone keys dialing)

00:02:54.257 --> 00:02:58.031
(Nana Komatsu sobbing)

00:03:05.814 --> 00:03:07.651
- Nobuo,

00:03:07.751 --> 00:03:09.889
Yoasu says lunch is ready.

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.326
It's spaghetti with mushrooms.

00:03:12.426 --> 00:03:14.565
- Awesome, I bet it'll
taste great.

00:03:14.665 --> 00:03:17.303
Yoasu's easily the
best cook out of all of us.

00:03:17.403 --> 00:03:20.442
- So who are you expecting
a message from?

00:03:20.543 --> 00:03:22.313
You've been checking
your phone all morning.

00:03:22.413 --> 00:03:25.252
- Oh, it's just 'cause the
reception's so bad out here.

00:03:25.352 --> 00:03:26.989
- But don't you usually
just leave your phone

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:28.693
back in your room?

00:03:28.793 --> 00:03:31.197
- Shin, why do you always have
to spy on

00:03:31.298 --> 00:03:32.801
other people's personal lives?

00:03:32.901 --> 00:03:34.738
It's really annoying.

00:03:34.838 --> 00:03:35.974
- Sorry, but with you,

00:03:36.074 --> 00:03:37.276
it's just too easy.

00:03:37.376 --> 00:03:38.580
I can read you like a book.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.184
- I don't want you
reading me, okay?

00:03:41.284 --> 00:03:43.388
- Sure. But I can't help it.

00:03:44.792 --> 00:03:45.961
It's dangerous here.

00:03:46.061 --> 00:03:47.263
If you stare at the stars long
enough

00:03:47.363 --> 00:03:50.169
you start thinking
you can grab one.

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:51.171
And you get this feeling

00:03:51.271 --> 00:03:53.576
like all your dreams
will come true.

00:03:55.981 --> 00:03:57.083
- [Reira] Hi Shin,

00:03:57.183 --> 00:03:59.420
thanks for your email.

00:03:59.521 --> 00:04:01.458
It's been so long since
I've seen stars

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:05.299
that shine as bright as the
ones that you described.

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:07.470
Even if I close my eyes,

00:04:07.571 --> 00:04:09.140
the only stars I can picture

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.315
are the fake ones they
have in planetarium shows.

00:04:13.415 --> 00:04:17.256
I was starting to feel
like one of those stars.

00:04:17.356 --> 00:04:20.597
Once again, you saved me
with your words, Shin.

00:04:21.498 --> 00:04:23.903
It really means a lot to me.

00:04:24.003 --> 00:04:27.376
(tea cup rattling)

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:32.453
(everyone sighing)

00:04:32.554 --> 00:04:33.589
- Thanks for the tea, Nami.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.492
You've got a pretty nice tan
there.

00:04:35.593 --> 00:04:36.227
- No, yes.

00:04:36.328 --> 00:04:37.163
I mean, I'm sorry.

00:04:37.263 --> 00:04:38.031
I'm kinda nervous.

00:04:38.131 --> 00:04:38.900
I can't believe I'm talking to
you.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.539
I've been a super
fan since the very beginning.

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:42.273
- You have?

00:04:42.373 --> 00:04:43.375
- It's okay, it's okay.

00:04:43.475 --> 00:04:45.613
She's just trying to be nice

00:04:45.714 --> 00:04:47.350
- [Mother] Honey.

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.253
- Do you think this tie
is too flashy for today?

00:04:49.354 --> 00:04:50.222
- Who cares about the tie?

00:04:50.322 --> 00:04:51.324
They're waiting for us

00:04:51.424 --> 00:04:53.395
- But I need to look dignified.

00:04:53.495 --> 00:04:54.497
Come on.

00:04:54.598 --> 00:04:57.136
- Hi, so sorry to keep you
waiting.

00:04:57.236 --> 00:04:59.942
(birds chirping)

00:05:00.042 --> 00:05:00.643
(upbeat music)

00:05:00.744 --> 00:05:03.516
- I'm Takumi Ichinose, it's
a pleasure to meet you.

00:05:03.616 --> 00:05:04.150
- Good God.

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:05.252
How tall are you?

00:05:05.352 --> 00:05:06.388
- Six feet and one inch.

00:05:06.488 --> 00:05:07.557
Isn't that right, darling?

00:05:07.658 --> 00:05:09.962
- I wasn't asking you
how tall he was.

00:05:10.062 --> 00:05:11.666
Stop babbling on like that.

00:05:11.766 --> 00:05:13.836
- I apologize that I wasn't able
to come

00:05:13.936 --> 00:05:15.172
and meet all of you sooner.

00:05:15.272 --> 00:05:17.376
I brought you some souvenirs
from London,

00:05:17.476 --> 00:05:19.715
but I'm afraid the only
thing that's really British

00:05:19.815 --> 00:05:20.082
is the tea.

00:05:20.182 --> 00:05:23.021
- Oh my that's a big souvenir.
- What is it, what is it!

00:05:23.121 --> 00:05:25.392
Wow, thanks future
brother-in-law,

00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:26.261
you're the best ever.

00:05:26.361 --> 00:05:27.263
- Oh, it's so soft.

00:05:27.363 --> 00:05:28.666
- This is gorgeous.

00:05:28.766 --> 00:05:30.436
Your father wouldn't buy
me something like this

00:05:30.537 --> 00:05:32.473
in a million years.

00:05:32.574 --> 00:05:34.812
- Well, you seem to be fairly
well off

00:05:34.912 --> 00:05:37.584
but do celebrities really
make that much money,

00:05:37.684 --> 00:05:39.053
Mr. Ichinose?

00:05:39.153 --> 00:05:40.422
- It all depends on the person.

00:05:40.523 --> 00:05:42.794
- Your income depends on
your popularity.

00:05:42.894 --> 00:05:43.529
- That's very true.

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:45.199
- And do you think it
will last long enough

00:05:45.299 --> 00:05:46.936
to support my daughter
and her child

00:05:47.036 --> 00:05:47.771
for the rest of their lives?

00:05:47.871 --> 00:05:49.842
- You have nothing to worry
about, sir.

00:05:49.942 --> 00:05:50.643
- Sir?

00:05:50.744 --> 00:05:53.181
- There's something I
don't like about this guy.

00:05:53.281 --> 00:05:54.183
- People might look at me

00:05:54.283 --> 00:05:55.587
as a sort of celebrity

00:05:55.687 --> 00:05:57.891
but I'm a businessman at heart.

00:05:57.991 --> 00:06:00.195
I know how hard it is
for a band to endure,

00:06:00.295 --> 00:06:03.503
even if that band is
as popular as ours.

00:06:03.603 --> 00:06:05.640
Of course I'd like Trap
Nest to keep going forever,

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:10.082
but that's not really something
I can control by myself.

00:06:10.182 --> 00:06:10.917
- Huh?

00:06:11.017 --> 00:06:11.552
(upbeat music)
(sirens wailing)

00:06:11.652 --> 00:06:14.525
- [Reira] I wore a wedding
dress today for the music video.

00:06:14.625 --> 00:06:18.065
But it's for a song about a
woman who can never get married.

00:06:18.165 --> 00:06:19.635
These people just don't get it.

00:06:19.735 --> 00:06:22.473
But they told me that I'm
the one who doesn't get it.

00:06:22.574 --> 00:06:24.177
That it's supposed to be ironic.

00:06:24.277 --> 00:06:26.549
Whatever, the shoot took all
day.

00:06:26.649 --> 00:06:27.818
Even though it's just for a few
scenes

00:06:27.918 --> 00:06:31.091
that'll only last a
couple seconds on screen.

00:06:31.191 --> 00:06:32.426
Everything is like that.

00:06:32.527 --> 00:06:34.330
People don't realize what a
hard job it is

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:35.934
to be a rock star.

00:06:36.034 --> 00:06:39.508
But I'm happiest when we work
on stuff together, as a band,

00:06:39.608 --> 00:06:41.111
it makes me feel like I have a
purpose

00:06:41.211 --> 00:06:43.014
and that I belong
to something.

00:06:43.115 --> 00:06:45.587
I think that's why I've
been able to keep singing.

00:06:45.687 --> 00:06:47.824
Even when things got tough.

00:06:48.526 --> 00:06:49.460
- All right, terrific.

00:06:49.561 --> 00:06:50.864
That'll do the job.

00:06:50.964 --> 00:06:51.565
- [Nana] That's it?

00:06:51.665 --> 00:06:52.534
- Yeah, we've got everything.

00:06:52.634 --> 00:06:55.139
Her voice is plateaued and
it's not gonna change now.

00:06:55.239 --> 00:06:57.476
No matter how many takes she
does.

00:06:57.577 --> 00:06:58.478
- In other words, Nana,

00:06:58.579 --> 00:06:59.782
you've given it all you've got

00:06:59.882 --> 00:07:01.084
and it's just super.

00:07:01.184 --> 00:07:02.419
What do you mean?

00:07:02.521 --> 00:07:03.589
- It's all good, Nana.

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:05.960
We're gonna fix those flat
notes with the pitch shifter.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.331
- Keep training so you don't
make a fool of yourself

00:07:08.431 --> 00:07:08.966
during the live shows

00:07:09.066 --> 00:07:11.739
'cause otherwise all the
music mags will rag on you.

00:07:11.839 --> 00:07:13.408
(everyone laughing)
- Shut up!

00:07:13.509 --> 00:07:14.277
Stop laughing.

00:07:14.377 --> 00:07:15.880
Let me try again.

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:18.418
- Well then, now that we're
done with the recording,

00:07:18.519 --> 00:07:20.222
what do you say, we go
fishing at the lake?

00:07:20.322 --> 00:07:21.659
- Sure, sounds good to me.

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:22.092
- Yeah.

00:07:22.193 --> 00:07:24.832
- This is the one thing I
wanted to do since we got here.

00:07:24.932 --> 00:07:25.466
- Fishing?

00:07:25.567 --> 00:07:28.573
- Matsuo, just let me try one
more time.

00:07:28.673 --> 00:07:30.777
- Shut up, you're scaring
the fish away.

00:07:30.877 --> 00:07:33.716
- So why did your wife
leave you?

00:07:33.816 --> 00:07:34.852
- [Reira] I've been thinking
about

00:07:34.952 --> 00:07:36.856
why Gaia decided to have
you recorded

00:07:36.956 --> 00:07:37.724
that training camp.

00:07:37.824 --> 00:07:39.795
It's probably because they
wanna strengthen the bond

00:07:39.895 --> 00:07:42.501
between the band and the
rest of the team.

00:07:42.601 --> 00:07:44.738
Shin, all those people
you'll be working with

00:07:44.838 --> 00:07:45.707
are like family.

00:07:45.807 --> 00:07:47.611
They're there to support you
guys.

00:07:47.711 --> 00:07:49.882
Trust me, you'll appreciate that
later on

00:07:49.982 --> 00:07:50.683
down the road.

00:07:50.783 --> 00:07:52.186
I guess what I'm trying to say
is

00:07:52.286 --> 00:07:55.125
that I think the camp is really
important.

00:07:55.225 --> 00:07:57.631
Try to make the most of it,
okay?

00:07:58.699 --> 00:08:00.603
- Tell us about
your family, Takumi,

00:08:00.703 --> 00:08:02.406
how many siblings do you have?

00:08:02.507 --> 00:08:04.110
- You have a big sister, right?

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:06.181
- Once again, no one
was asking you.

00:08:06.281 --> 00:08:06.715
- Honey?

00:08:06.815 --> 00:08:08.653
- You have to let me talk
sometimes too,

00:08:08.753 --> 00:08:10.255
otherwise this is no fun.

00:08:10.355 --> 00:08:10.924
- Sure, okay.

00:08:11.024 --> 00:08:13.829
But what the hell do you
know about my family, anyway?

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:14.765
- What was that?

00:08:14.865 --> 00:08:15.399
- Oh, sorry.

00:08:15.499 --> 00:08:17.303
- Hey, it's totally fine.

00:08:17.403 --> 00:08:19.207
You can talk that way
to me whenever you want.

00:08:19.307 --> 00:08:20.008
It's not fine.

00:08:20.108 --> 00:08:21.812
And you better watch
what you're saying.

00:08:21.912 --> 00:08:24.483
- [Goro] Nami, why don't you
go out and get us some sake.

00:08:24.585 --> 00:08:25.252
- [Mother] Good idea.

00:08:25.352 --> 00:08:27.156
And pick up some stuff for
the Sukiyaki.

00:08:27.256 --> 00:08:28.225
- What, no way.

00:08:28.325 --> 00:08:29.561
I don't even know what
you're supposed to get.

00:08:29.661 --> 00:08:32.499
- Let's go, I'll drive
you Nami, come on.

00:08:32.601 --> 00:08:34.403
Don't you wanna show
off that new bag?

00:08:34.504 --> 00:08:35.339
(Takumi chuckling)

00:08:35.439 --> 00:08:37.409
- Please don't tell me
you're into Nami's type.

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:39.347
Don't even go there, all right?

00:08:39.447 --> 00:08:40.583
- Sorry about that.

00:08:40.683 --> 00:08:43.321
Nana and Nami are both such
noisy girls.

00:08:43.421 --> 00:08:44.357
- Me too?

00:08:44.457 --> 00:08:45.894
But I'm nothing like Nami.

00:08:45.994 --> 00:08:48.198
- Oh no, this has been
interesting.

00:08:48.298 --> 00:08:49.433
At my house growing up,

00:08:49.534 --> 00:08:50.002
everything was quiet

00:08:50.102 --> 00:08:52.206
because my mother
was always sick.

00:08:52.306 --> 00:08:53.576
So ever since I was
a little kid,

00:08:53.676 --> 00:08:55.647
I've been fascinated
by people who are happy

00:08:55.747 --> 00:08:58.285
and full of energy.

00:08:58.385 --> 00:09:00.757
- Being around a happy
family scene like yours,

00:09:00.857 --> 00:09:03.361
I've never experienced
that before.

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:05.767
It's interesting.

00:09:08.873 --> 00:09:09.073
- I see.

00:09:09.173 --> 00:09:12.514
Well, we can guarantee that
Nana is at least healthy.

00:09:12.614 --> 00:09:14.350
- So how is your family
doing now?

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:16.154
- My mother passed
away six years ago.

00:09:16.254 --> 00:09:18.358
And my sister married a
guy from the neighborhood

00:09:18.458 --> 00:09:19.661
where we grew up.

00:09:19.761 --> 00:09:20.730
They live with my father now,

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:22.701
and they have two children.

00:09:22.801 --> 00:09:25.172
- Okay. Then, I think we
ought to go visit them

00:09:25.272 --> 00:09:26.040
sometime soon,

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:27.076
before the wedding.

00:09:27.176 --> 00:09:27.811
All of us will go,

00:09:27.911 --> 00:09:29.781
and we'll visit your
mother's grave as well.

00:09:29.881 --> 00:09:30.550
- Of course.

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:32.119
- No, you don't have to.

00:09:32.219 --> 00:09:32.821
(parents gasping)

00:09:32.921 --> 00:09:35.425
The truth is my father's
an alcoholic.

00:09:35.526 --> 00:09:37.329
He can't even have a
normal conversation

00:09:37.429 --> 00:09:38.933
with people these days.

00:09:39.033 --> 00:09:40.135
I'm sorry

00:09:40.235 --> 00:09:41.204
- An alcoholic?

00:09:41.304 --> 00:09:42.172
That must be tough on you.

00:09:42.273 --> 00:09:44.978
- But we should at least
go and introduce ourselves.

00:09:45.078 --> 00:09:45.847
- No, really.

00:09:45.947 --> 00:09:46.815
It's alright.

00:09:46.915 --> 00:09:48.853
He didn't go to my
sister's wedding

00:09:48.953 --> 00:09:51.659
or even to my mother's
funeral for that matter.

00:09:51.759 --> 00:09:54.665
And I know I don't want to
invite him to our wedding.

00:09:54.765 --> 00:09:56.835
I don't want him to ruin it.

00:09:58.338 --> 00:09:59.975
If the father's life
is messed up,

00:10:00.075 --> 00:10:02.446
then the kid's gonna be
messed up too.

00:10:02.547 --> 00:10:04.083
I'm living proof.

00:10:05.853 --> 00:10:08.391
Anyway, about the venue
for the wedding,

00:10:08.491 --> 00:10:09.427
please have a look,

00:10:09.528 --> 00:10:10.395
and let me know what you think.

00:10:10.495 --> 00:10:11.397
- Why are you talking to us

00:10:11.497 --> 00:10:13.101
as if you're trying to sell
us something?

00:10:13.201 --> 00:10:13.936
- Goro, please.

00:10:14.036 --> 00:10:14.838
That's enough.

00:10:14.938 --> 00:10:15.673
(Goro growling)

00:10:15.773 --> 00:10:19.146
(Takumi chuckling)

00:10:25.392 --> 00:10:27.062
(door knocking)

00:10:27.162 --> 00:10:30.102
(Reiko groaning)

00:10:34.043 --> 00:10:35.078
- Huh?

00:10:37.249 --> 00:10:40.723
(footsteps plodding)

00:10:42.259 --> 00:10:45.733
(knocking door) Ren?

00:10:53.448 --> 00:10:54.751
(Reira sighing)

00:10:54.851 --> 00:10:58.526
(footsteps plodding)

00:11:02.433 --> 00:11:05.573
(soothing music)

00:11:20.369 --> 00:11:21.538
Ren, don't sleep here,

00:11:21.638 --> 00:11:23.041
you'll catch it cold.

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:33.963
Come on Ren, be a good boy, now.

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:37.136
There.

00:11:38.639 --> 00:11:40.041
- [Girl] Reira?

00:11:40.142 --> 00:11:40.743
- I'm sorry.

00:11:40.843 --> 00:11:43.314
I must have dozed off.

00:11:43.415 --> 00:11:45.853
- Did Ren really pass out in the
bathtub?

00:11:45.953 --> 00:11:48.559
Do you think he's all right?

00:11:48.659 --> 00:11:52.099
- Yeah, this is nothing
new for him.

00:11:53.836 --> 00:11:55.973
Will you help me get
him to his bed?

00:11:56.074 --> 00:11:57.076
- [Girl] Sure.

00:12:00.115 --> 00:12:01.317
- Shin,

00:12:01.417 --> 00:12:05.760
I'm so bummed that I left
that cool lighter in Japan.

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:08.766
Remember how you forgot
it in my room before?

00:12:10.001 --> 00:12:11.404
I decided not to bring it

00:12:11.505 --> 00:12:12.941
because I didn't wanna lose it,

00:12:13.041 --> 00:12:14.043
or break it.

00:12:14.143 --> 00:12:17.784
But I feel anxious if
it's not within my reach,

00:12:17.884 --> 00:12:22.292
To cherish something is a
difficult thing to do, isn't it?

00:12:23.796 --> 00:12:26.568
I fly back to Japan on the 27th.

00:12:27.369 --> 00:12:29.508
Will you be back in Tokyo then?

00:12:29.608 --> 00:12:31.612
I really hope so.

00:12:31.712 --> 00:12:35.620
I wanna see you and talk
to you face to face.

00:12:36.655 --> 00:12:37.857
I believe it's only

00:12:37.957 --> 00:12:39.160
when you're able to be with
someone

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.364
without all the lies
and pretense,

00:12:41.464 --> 00:12:44.805
that you can really start
to examine yourself.

00:12:44.905 --> 00:12:46.407
But if you look away,

00:12:46.508 --> 00:12:48.044
you lose everything.

00:12:48.813 --> 00:12:51.585
And I don't wanna lose.

00:12:57.831 --> 00:13:00.736
(upbeat music)

00:13:00.837 --> 00:13:02.206
- Did you read it?

00:13:02.306 --> 00:13:04.343
- Yeah.

00:13:04.443 --> 00:13:07.617
Our week-long recording/bootcamp
finally came to an end

00:13:07.717 --> 00:13:09.921
without any problems.

00:13:10.021 --> 00:13:11.859
We were on our way back to
Tokyo,

00:13:11.959 --> 00:13:13.261
but we couldn't go home

00:13:13.361 --> 00:13:15.633
'cause of all the paparazzi.

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:16.935
- Oh Shin,

00:13:17.035 --> 00:13:18.706
I didn't know you liked
to read real books.

00:13:18.806 --> 00:13:19.741
What you got there?

00:13:19.841 --> 00:13:20.475
An erotic novel.

00:13:20.576 --> 00:13:23.314
Mika picked it up for me
at the station news stand.

00:13:23.414 --> 00:13:24.216
- So how is it?

00:13:24.316 --> 00:13:24.885
Any good?

00:13:24.985 --> 00:13:26.320
- [Shin] Actually, it's pretty
lame.

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:29.628
- No point in teasing and
Shin about that stuff, Mika.

00:13:29.728 --> 00:13:31.965
He knows more about it than you
do.

00:13:33.101 --> 00:13:34.270
- But I'm learning a lot from
this book.

00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:36.440
- [Nana] What the hell are you
learning?

00:13:36.542 --> 00:13:38.178
The Cougar next door?

00:13:38.278 --> 00:13:39.046
- When we arrived,

00:13:39.146 --> 00:13:40.850
we were immediately shuffled off

00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:43.622
to the agency's so-called Dorm.

00:13:43.722 --> 00:13:45.058
- We just call it the Dorm.

00:13:45.158 --> 00:13:47.062
It's really a regular apartment
building.

00:13:47.162 --> 00:13:50.870
The landlord rents exclusively
to our agency's talent.

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:52.239
You'll each have your own room.

00:13:52.339 --> 00:13:55.680
There's no curfew, or annoying
dorm supervisor, or anything.

00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:57.650
Plus it's got great
facilities and security.

00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:00.121
So you guys will be really
comfortable.

00:14:00.222 --> 00:14:01.224
- [Nana] I don't care what it
is.

00:14:01.324 --> 00:14:04.129
As long as I can lay
low and get some rest.

00:14:08.037 --> 00:14:10.877
- Nah, you probably don't
wanna open your curtain much

00:14:10.977 --> 00:14:12.312
while you're here.

00:14:12.412 --> 00:14:14.016
There's a love hotel next door.

00:14:14.116 --> 00:14:15.586
But they probably won't be
opening

00:14:15.686 --> 00:14:18.224
their curtains much either.

00:14:18.324 --> 00:14:20.262
- So what's comfortable about
this dump?

00:14:20.362 --> 00:14:21.832
I don't even get sunlight in
here.

00:14:21.932 --> 00:14:23.736
- You've got your own
private toilet and shower.

00:14:23.836 --> 00:14:24.738
- Where's the tub?

00:14:24.838 --> 00:14:26.909
- I had no idea you were
this much of a whiner.

00:14:27.009 --> 00:14:29.380
Who do you think you are,
anyway?

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.650
If you wanna live the good life,

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:31.885
you've gotta work for it.

00:14:31.985 --> 00:14:33.956
Starting tomorrow, your
schedule's booked solid.

00:14:34.056 --> 00:14:37.095
So we'll see just how hard you
can work.

00:14:38.298 --> 00:14:39.433
- [Nana] Wait, Ginpei,

00:14:39.534 --> 00:14:40.235
What about a phone?

00:14:40.335 --> 00:14:42.306
There's one at the
front desk in the lobby.

00:14:42.406 --> 00:14:43.174
- The front desk?

00:14:43.274 --> 00:14:44.878
- Why don't you get a
cell phone?

00:14:44.978 --> 00:14:45.746
You should have one for
work, anyway.

00:14:45.846 --> 00:14:48.519
- How can you call that
a front desk?

00:14:48.619 --> 00:14:50.422
(guard snoring)

00:14:50.523 --> 00:14:51.525
The dumb guard's asleep.

00:14:51.625 --> 00:14:53.161
What's the point of having one?

00:14:53.261 --> 00:14:53.829
- He's bored,

00:14:53.929 --> 00:14:54.898
which means the place is safe.

00:14:54.998 --> 00:14:56.835
Okay, tomorrow morning,
I'm gonna come by

00:14:56.935 --> 00:14:58.004
and pick you up at 7:00.

00:14:58.104 --> 00:15:00.776
Don't go wandering off
without telling anyone.

00:15:00.876 --> 00:15:01.612
(door slamming shut)

00:15:01.712 --> 00:15:02.880
- Something's wrong here.

00:15:02.981 --> 00:15:05.151
Something's definitely wrong
with this record label.

00:15:05.252 --> 00:15:08.592
Even the CEO acts like
a total weirdo.

00:15:08.692 --> 00:15:10.730
- Go, rock the world.

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:12.867
- No, I know I
shouldn't judge people

00:15:12.967 --> 00:15:14.838
just by their looks.

00:15:14.938 --> 00:15:17.610
But this guy looks
like a scumbag too.

00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:18.812
- And just who are you, lady?

00:15:18.912 --> 00:15:20.750
- I'm Nana, from
the Black Stones.

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:22.820
We just met 20 minutes ago.

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:23.656
- All right.

00:15:23.756 --> 00:15:24.858
What do you want?

00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.093
- I just wanna use the phone.

00:15:26.193 --> 00:15:27.730
- You don't have to
ask my permission.

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:29.500
It's free.

00:15:29.601 --> 00:15:30.302
(Nana growling)

00:15:30.402 --> 00:15:32.272
(footsteps plodding)

00:15:32.372 --> 00:15:32.974
- Forget it.

00:15:33.074 --> 00:15:34.978
The creep's eavesdropping.

00:15:35.078 --> 00:15:37.382
I'll just use Nobuo's phone.

00:15:37.482 --> 00:15:39.420
- Hey, I said you could use it.

00:15:40.756 --> 00:15:41.725
(elevator doors sliding open)

00:15:41.825 --> 00:15:43.294
- What am I gonna say to Ren

00:15:43.394 --> 00:15:44.831
when I talk to him?

00:15:48.438 --> 00:15:50.041
I mean, it's not like we'll be
able

00:15:50.141 --> 00:15:51.778
to see each other for a while.

00:15:51.878 --> 00:15:53.582
I almost wish he'd
just leave me alone

00:15:53.682 --> 00:15:55.953
if he can't gimme all
his attention.

00:15:56.955 --> 00:15:58.993
That's what I should say to him.

00:16:00.462 --> 00:16:06.140
(inhaling) It's so hard
to breathe in here.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:09.113
It's probably because
the air's polluted.

00:16:10.448 --> 00:16:13.822
That's the one thing I hate
about Tokyo.

00:16:16.093 --> 00:16:17.530
- [Yuri] Really, the Black
Stones?

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:19.033
I totally know you
guys.

00:16:19.133 --> 00:16:20.936
- [Nobuo] Seriously?

00:16:21.037 --> 00:16:22.439
- [Yuri] Yeah, you're like kinda
famous.

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:23.341
- [Nobuo] Not famous like you.

00:16:23.441 --> 00:16:25.579
- [Yuri] (screaming) This
is so cool.

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:27.416
Get in here, now.

00:16:27.517 --> 00:16:28.886
It's fine, come on.

00:16:28.986 --> 00:16:30.890
(Nana smacking Nobuo)

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:32.292
- What do you doing, shorty?

00:16:32.392 --> 00:16:33.294
You think you have time for
that?

00:16:33.394 --> 00:16:35.633
- No, I was just saying
hi to my neighbor

00:16:35.733 --> 00:16:37.537
- Nana?

00:16:37.637 --> 00:16:40.576
- Oh my God, she's the
hottest chick I've ever seen.

00:16:40.676 --> 00:16:41.712
- (screaming) it's really Nana.

00:16:41.812 --> 00:16:43.582
Can I have your autograph?

00:16:43.682 --> 00:16:44.884
- Huh? Yuri Kosaka?

00:16:44.984 --> 00:16:45.720
- The porn star?

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:48.391
- You all seem to be
very familiar with her.

00:16:49.761 --> 00:16:52.399
What kind of agency is
Shika Corporation, anyway?

00:16:52.499 --> 00:16:54.069
I mean, why do they
have a porn star

00:16:54.169 --> 00:16:55.673
on their roster of clients?

00:16:55.773 --> 00:16:56.708
- She used to be a singer,

00:16:56.808 --> 00:16:58.244
but her popularity was
short-lived.

00:16:58.344 --> 00:17:00.583
So she decided to take
her clothes off.

00:17:00.683 --> 00:17:02.486
- You sure know a lot about her.

00:17:03.354 --> 00:17:03.789
But seriously,

00:17:03.889 --> 00:17:05.258
how could anyone think it's a
good idea

00:17:05.358 --> 00:17:06.862
to have a co-ed dormitory.

00:17:06.962 --> 00:17:08.264
That's just asking for trouble.

00:17:08.364 --> 00:17:10.001
- I'm guessing the talent they
put here,

00:17:10.101 --> 00:17:11.070
either need to be watched,

00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:12.573
or they need to hide out.

00:17:12.673 --> 00:17:13.742
- Like Ginpei said,

00:17:13.842 --> 00:17:14.677
they call it the Dorm,

00:17:14.778 --> 00:17:15.946
but it's not really a dorm.

00:17:16.047 --> 00:17:16.848
- That's for sure.

00:17:16.948 --> 00:17:18.284
But you know a porn star

00:17:18.384 --> 00:17:20.455
who makes as many movies
as her must be rich.

00:17:20.556 --> 00:17:23.428
So why is Ms. Yuri
living in this dump?

00:17:23.529 --> 00:17:24.296
- Ms. Yuri?

00:17:24.396 --> 00:17:26.735
Nobuo, you're switching
rooms with me right away.

00:17:26.835 --> 00:17:27.302
- Why?

00:17:27.402 --> 00:17:28.337
- I don't want Little Ms. Red
Yuri

00:17:28.438 --> 00:17:29.808
to be next door
to a big, bad Wolf like you.

00:17:29.908 --> 00:17:31.077
- What am I gonna do?

00:17:31.177 --> 00:17:32.412
She's a professional.

00:17:32.513 --> 00:17:33.281
- I don't care.

00:17:33.381 --> 00:17:35.051
Switch with me.

00:17:35.151 --> 00:17:37.690
- Why do you always have
to be so Goddamn bossy?

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:38.525
- Listen Nobuo,

00:17:38.625 --> 00:17:42.032
I don't care if you get
off by watching porn, okay.

00:17:42.132 --> 00:17:43.267
But I'd really hate for you

00:17:43.367 --> 00:17:45.906
to have forgotten about
our secret operation.

00:17:46.006 --> 00:17:47.142
- Operation?

00:17:47.242 --> 00:17:50.081
- (growling) Operation get
Hachiko back, remember?

00:17:50.181 --> 00:17:51.918
We promised to fight together on
this.

00:17:52.018 --> 00:17:54.557
So don't go messing
around with other girls.

00:17:54.657 --> 00:17:55.860
- Hold on a minute.

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.162
I think you misunderstood me.

00:17:57.262 --> 00:17:59.199
- Misunderstood you, huh?

00:17:59.299 --> 00:18:00.569
You were totally hanging
all over Yuri,

00:18:00.669 --> 00:18:02.740
with that horny look stuck
on your face.

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:04.511
- Nah, I'm not talking
about that.

00:18:04.611 --> 00:18:06.982
You know, I'll always
fight side by side with you

00:18:07.082 --> 00:18:09.253
but not in some mission to
get Hachi back.

00:18:09.353 --> 00:18:11.758
For me, Hachi in the
band are separate issues.

00:18:11.858 --> 00:18:15.331
I mean, it's not like she
was ever a member of Blast.

00:18:15.431 --> 00:18:17.169
(Nana gasping)

00:18:17.269 --> 00:18:19.574
Besides why do I want
to help keep her around

00:18:19.674 --> 00:18:22.279
just for you when I've
totally given up on her.

00:18:22.379 --> 00:18:24.918
So you do whatever you
feel like you have to

00:18:25.018 --> 00:18:26.855
but leave me out of it.

00:18:26.955 --> 00:18:29.561
(suspenseful music)

00:18:29.661 --> 00:18:30.328
- But...

00:18:30.428 --> 00:18:34.002
- Damn, why are you so stubborn?

00:18:34.102 --> 00:18:39.313
- So what are we fighting
for then? (gasping)

00:18:43.689 --> 00:18:45.826
That's a dumb question.

00:18:45.926 --> 00:18:49.534
We're fighting because we
wanna get our music out there,

00:18:49.634 --> 00:18:52.472
and be recognized as
a real band.

00:18:53.274 --> 00:18:54.811
Hachi has nothing to do with it.

00:18:54.911 --> 00:18:56.046
- Nana?

00:18:56.147 --> 00:18:59.654
- Nobuo is free to go out
with whoever he wants.

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:02.927
(water bubbling)

00:19:03.027 --> 00:19:06.902
Then how can I stay
connected to Hachi,

00:19:07.002 --> 00:19:08.639
there's gotta be a way.

00:19:08.739 --> 00:19:10.943
I know I can't go back
to that apartment.

00:19:11.043 --> 00:19:12.747
And even if I did,

00:19:12.847 --> 00:19:14.483
she's not gonna be there.

00:19:18.357 --> 00:19:21.063
Hey Yasu, what does this mean?

00:19:21.163 --> 00:19:23.835
- Itsuwari, The lie.

00:19:23.936 --> 00:19:25.104
- Cool, thanks.

00:19:25.205 --> 00:19:28.277
(phone ringing)

00:19:28.879 --> 00:19:29.747
- Hello?

00:19:29.848 --> 00:19:30.816
- Hey, Yasu,

00:19:30.916 --> 00:19:32.219
it's Nana.

00:19:34.022 --> 00:19:34.824
- Nana.

00:19:34.924 --> 00:19:36.728
(dramatic music)

00:19:36.828 --> 00:19:41.070
(Nana gasping for air)

00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:42.907
Shin, go call an
ambulance right away.

00:19:43.007 --> 00:19:44.309
The number's 119.

00:19:44.409 --> 00:19:45.679
- [Shin] Okay, what's the
address here?

00:19:45.779 --> 00:19:47.750
- Just tell the security
guard what's happened

00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:48.819
and have him call.

00:19:48.919 --> 00:19:49.821
- Got it.

00:19:49.921 --> 00:19:51.625
(footsteps plodding)

00:19:51.725 --> 00:19:53.829
(dramatic music)

00:19:53.929 --> 00:19:54.797
- We were just talking.

00:19:54.898 --> 00:19:56.133
And then the next thing I know,

00:19:56.233 --> 00:19:57.435
she's having trouble breathing.

00:19:57.536 --> 00:20:00.141
It was like she went
into shock or something.

00:20:00.241 --> 00:20:03.782
(Nana gasping for air)

00:20:05.218 --> 00:20:07.289
- Nana, are you all right?

00:20:07.389 --> 00:20:09.326
An ambulance is on the way.

00:20:11.363 --> 00:20:12.600
You're gonna be fine.

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:14.036
Don't worry.

00:20:14.136 --> 00:20:16.240
I'll be with you the whole time.

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:18.144
I'm not going anywhere.

00:20:18.244 --> 00:20:21.818
(Nana gasping for air)

00:20:29.968 --> 00:20:32.372
- I think she's
hyperventilating.

00:20:33.374 --> 00:20:34.711
When that happens,

00:20:34.811 --> 00:20:37.315
you feel like you'll die from
the pain,

00:20:37.415 --> 00:20:39.419
but you never will die from it.

00:20:40.756 --> 00:20:42.359
It's a living hell.

00:20:43.094 --> 00:20:44.263
- Hey, wait.

00:20:44.363 --> 00:20:46.701
- Nobuo, do you have
a paper or plastic bag

00:20:46.801 --> 00:20:47.603
we could use?

00:20:47.703 --> 00:20:48.505
- What for?

00:20:48.605 --> 00:20:49.139
- Just hurry,

00:20:49.239 --> 00:20:50.643
go find one.

00:20:52.412 --> 00:20:54.483
- [Nana] Hey Hachi,

00:20:55.753 --> 00:20:58.959
humans are such hopeless
creatures.

00:20:59.059 --> 00:21:00.929
It seems the harder we struggle,

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:02.533
the deeper we sink.

00:21:04.469 --> 00:21:06.307
If I could be reincarnated,

00:21:06.407 --> 00:21:08.210
I'd wanna be a fish.

00:21:09.012 --> 00:21:10.549
Then I'd swim with Ren.

00:21:11.618 --> 00:21:15.592
Just the two of us in
our little fish bowl.
