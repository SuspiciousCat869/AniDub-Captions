00:00:05.252 --> 00:00:08.158
- [Nana Komatsu] That night,
Nana took Misato by the hand

00:00:08.258 --> 00:00:11.197
and led her out of the
room without saying a word.

00:00:11.297 --> 00:00:14.170
She didn't return until the
morning.

00:00:15.005 --> 00:00:18.411
(upbeat rock music)

00:01:54.938 --> 00:01:58.011
(keys clacking)

00:02:05.526 --> 00:02:07.396
(lighter flickers)

00:02:07.496 --> 00:02:09.668
(Yasu exhales)

00:02:09.768 --> 00:02:12.339
(dinging)

00:02:13.041 --> 00:02:15.713
(Yasu sighs)

00:02:15.813 --> 00:02:18.485
(footsteps)

00:02:21.324 --> 00:02:21.892
- Hello?

00:02:21.992 --> 00:02:23.829
- [Nana Osaki] Here I am.

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:24.765
- Huh?

00:02:24.865 --> 00:02:25.499
(door opens)

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.038
What are you doing here
so early in the morning?

00:02:28.138 --> 00:02:30.543
- Well, I didn't wake you,
you're already dressed.

00:02:30.643 --> 00:02:31.845
You getting ready to go to work?

00:02:31.945 --> 00:02:34.016
- Hardly, after I came
home from the office

00:02:34.116 --> 00:02:36.020
I kept working on some stuff I
had to do.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.189
- You worked through the night?

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:38.692
Don't you know, it was a long
weekend?

00:02:38.793 --> 00:02:42.499
I guess working in a law firm
can keep you really busy, huh?

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.234
Honestly, when do you sleep?

00:02:43.334 --> 00:02:45.105
- I was about to grab a few
hours

00:02:45.205 --> 00:02:46.742
before heading back to the
office again.

00:02:46.842 --> 00:02:47.577
- [Nana Osaki] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:02:47.677 --> 00:02:48.445
I'm coming in.

00:02:48.546 --> 00:02:50.717
(Nana Osaki sighs)

00:02:50.817 --> 00:02:54.090
(footsteps)

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.962
- So are you gonna tell
me why you're here?

00:02:59.634 --> 00:03:01.638
- Me and Misato were
kicking it up a little

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:02.372
in her hotel room,

00:03:02.473 --> 00:03:04.578
but a single bed is just too
small

00:03:04.678 --> 00:03:06.114
for two people to sleep in.

00:03:06.214 --> 00:03:06.882
- What?

00:03:06.982 --> 00:03:08.719
That girl is still in town.

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:09.386
What about school?

00:03:09.487 --> 00:03:10.890
- She goes to an all girls
school

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.025
and she has no friends there,

00:03:12.126 --> 00:03:12.994
so she doesn't wanna go back.

00:03:13.094 --> 00:03:14.063
(Yasu laughs)

00:03:14.163 --> 00:03:16.167
- But won't her parents
be worried about her?

00:03:16.267 --> 00:03:18.238
She looks like one of
those spoiled rich kids.

00:03:18.338 --> 00:03:21.010
- Actually, I don't think her
parents care what she does.

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.214
The things she says
remind me a lot of Shin.

00:03:23.314 --> 00:03:25.720
I bet she's gonna run
away from home someday.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.891
- Ah, just like Shin.

00:03:27.991 --> 00:03:30.162
Sometimes I wonder if he's a
lost cause,

00:03:30.262 --> 00:03:32.299
I hope he's not shooting up or
anything,

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:34.571
'cause he's been looking
kind of harsh lately.

00:03:34.671 --> 00:03:35.640
- Speaking of looking harsh,

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.111
there's something I've
been meaning to tell you,

00:03:38.211 --> 00:03:40.850
when you're not wearing your
shades you look even more evil.

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.720
(Yasu sighs)

00:03:42.821 --> 00:03:43.756
- Why don't you shut up?

00:03:43.856 --> 00:03:44.624
(Nana Osaki laughs)

00:03:44.724 --> 00:03:46.093
- I don't know what you're
trying to hide

00:03:46.194 --> 00:03:49.200
but you certainly don't
look like a lawyer to me.

00:03:50.402 --> 00:03:53.709
- Nana, if you're gonna
sleep, go sleep at your place.

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:55.378
- Come sleep with me.

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.947
- What?

00:03:56.047 --> 00:03:57.416
Don't mess with me.

00:03:57.517 --> 00:03:58.853
- Then I'm outta here.

00:03:58.953 --> 00:04:01.625
(footsteps)

00:04:03.061 --> 00:04:05.566
(Yasu sighs)

00:04:05.666 --> 00:04:06.768
- Hold on.

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:09.541
Wasn't there something you
wanted to talk to me about?

00:04:09.641 --> 00:04:10.208
What's up?

00:04:10.308 --> 00:04:12.146
- Excuse me for coming
over just to see you.

00:04:12.246 --> 00:04:16.053
Have a good night.
(door slams)

00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:20.495
(Yasu sighs)

00:04:20.596 --> 00:04:23.434
(Yasu exhales)

00:04:30.148 --> 00:04:33.021
(footsteps)

00:04:33.856 --> 00:04:39.333
(Yasu gasps)
(gentle music)

00:04:41.505 --> 00:04:42.507
- Nana!

00:04:44.578 --> 00:04:48.251
(gentle music continues)

00:04:50.857 --> 00:04:53.194
- I gotta go back to work today.

00:04:53.294 --> 00:04:56.100
So I should try to get
some rest.

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.839
I couldn't sleep at all
last night.

00:04:58.939 --> 00:05:01.310
(door opens)
(Nana Komatsu gasps)

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:02.379
- Nana?

00:05:03.616 --> 00:05:04.684
(Nana Osaki grunts)

00:05:04.784 --> 00:05:06.053
(footsteps)

00:05:06.153 --> 00:05:07.122
I'm sorry.

00:05:07.222 --> 00:05:09.126
I didn't mean to yell at you
like that.

00:05:09.226 --> 00:05:11.532
I was tired and confused
and in a bad mood

00:05:11.632 --> 00:05:13.569
and I shouldn't have taken
it out on you.

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:16.675
I just want you to
know that I'm really sorry.

00:05:16.775 --> 00:05:18.144
Are you mad at me?

00:05:18.244 --> 00:05:20.348
- Not really.

00:05:20.448 --> 00:05:24.189
I was being selfish and
inconsiderate, just like you
said

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.528
- Then why did you end
up staying out all night?

00:05:26.628 --> 00:05:28.298
I was so worried about you.
(Nana Osaki sighs)

00:05:28.398 --> 00:05:30.068
You don't have a cell and
I didn't know what to do,

00:05:30.168 --> 00:05:32.005
I felt so bad I
couldn't even sleep.

00:05:32.105 --> 00:05:33.374
- I'm not your boyfriend, Nana.

00:05:33.474 --> 00:05:36.013
- No, you're way more
important than that!

00:05:36.113 --> 00:05:37.617
What happened to Misato?

00:05:37.717 --> 00:05:39.320
Did she go back home?

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.023
- Nah, she's sleeping at
a hotel.

00:05:41.123 --> 00:05:42.727
She's gonna take the train
home

00:05:42.827 --> 00:05:44.196
after she checks out at noon.

00:05:44.296 --> 00:05:45.700
- What should I do?

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:46.334
- About what?

00:05:46.434 --> 00:05:49.173
- After what I said, Misato
must think I'm a total jerk.

00:05:49.273 --> 00:05:50.643
I mean, she didn't
do anything wrong.

00:05:50.743 --> 00:05:53.916
She was having so much fun
and I ruined everything.

00:05:54.016 --> 00:05:55.553
I need to apologize to her.

00:05:55.653 --> 00:05:58.191
You don't know if Misato
has a cell phone, do you?

00:05:58.291 --> 00:05:59.260
- Yeah, she has one.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.328
- Can you give me her number?

00:06:00.428 --> 00:06:01.264
I wanna call her.

00:06:01.364 --> 00:06:03.167
- Okay, but she's
probably still sleeping

00:06:03.268 --> 00:06:05.005
so I wouldn't try calling her
till later.

00:06:05.105 --> 00:06:05.840
- Right!

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.510
- Just a minute, I'll get it.

00:06:08.244 --> 00:06:09.146
(zipper opening)

00:06:09.246 --> 00:06:10.081
(rummaging)

00:06:10.181 --> 00:06:11.250
I'm sure it's in here somewhere.

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:13.923
- Hey Nana, when will you
be getting home tonight?

00:06:14.023 --> 00:06:15.091
- Stop hanging on me!

00:06:15.191 --> 00:06:16.595
- I thought maybe we
could go out for dinner.

00:06:16.695 --> 00:06:18.298
- Whatever, but I won't be home
till nine.

00:06:18.398 --> 00:06:21.437
- In that case, I'll make
you a special apology dinner.

00:06:21.538 --> 00:06:22.072
- Here you go.

00:06:22.172 --> 00:06:23.842
- Thanks.

00:06:23.943 --> 00:06:24.744
(door opens)

00:06:24.844 --> 00:06:26.581
I'm off to work, bye!

00:06:26.682 --> 00:06:27.984
(door closes)

00:06:28.084 --> 00:06:30.455
(footsteps)

00:06:30.556 --> 00:06:33.194
(phone ringing in the
background)

00:06:33.294 --> 00:06:35.398
What should we have for dinner?

00:06:35.498 --> 00:06:38.271
Oh, maybe I can make
those burgers tonight.

00:06:40.776 --> 00:06:43.582
I wonder what she
cooked for Shoji.

00:06:44.283 --> 00:06:44.684
- Miss Komatsu,

00:06:44.784 --> 00:06:45.720
what are you doing?
(Nana Komatsu gasps)

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:47.255
Personal use of the internet
is not allowed at work.

00:06:47.356 --> 00:06:49.628
- But this is work, Ms.
Sakagami!

00:06:49.728 --> 00:06:51.430
I was doing research for the
next issue.

00:06:51.531 --> 00:06:54.036
I was thinking what if we
included a recipe section?

00:06:54.136 --> 00:06:55.038
- A recipe section?

00:06:55.138 --> 00:06:56.742
Our demographic
isn't just women.

00:06:56.842 --> 00:06:59.648
- What, you don't think
guys wanna know how to cook?

00:06:59.748 --> 00:07:00.683
- Don't talk back to me.

00:07:00.783 --> 00:07:02.419
You're far too young to
have your own column,

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.658
and besides we're not
paying you to have ideas,

00:07:04.758 --> 00:07:07.062
you're here to do
what we tell you.

00:07:07.162 --> 00:07:08.097
- Screw you!

00:07:08.197 --> 00:07:09.466
Treating me like they're
servant.

00:07:09.567 --> 00:07:11.972
Well, I guess I am, but still.

00:07:12.072 --> 00:07:12.607
(footsteps)

00:07:12.707 --> 00:07:14.611
- Where do you think you're
going now?

00:07:14.711 --> 00:07:15.579
- Out to lunch.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.119
(door slams)
(Ms. Sakagami growls)

00:07:19.219 --> 00:07:21.558
I gotta quit that place.

00:07:21.658 --> 00:07:24.196
But I need to find something
else first.

00:07:24.296 --> 00:07:26.501
If I quit without having
another job,

00:07:26.601 --> 00:07:31.277
Nana's gonna throw me out
and we only just made up.

00:07:31.377 --> 00:07:32.212
(Nana Komatsu gasps)

00:07:32.312 --> 00:07:33.047
I almost forgot.

00:07:33.147 --> 00:07:34.584
I better call Misato.

00:07:35.786 --> 00:07:41.430
(upbeat electronic music)
(Misato gasps)

00:07:42.099 --> 00:07:43.434
- Hello.

00:07:43.535 --> 00:07:45.338
- [Nana Komatsu] Hi, is this
Misato?

00:07:45.438 --> 00:07:46.641
This is Nana Komatsu.

00:07:46.742 --> 00:07:47.275
(Misato gasps)

00:07:47.376 --> 00:07:48.444
- Nana, how are you?

00:07:48.545 --> 00:07:49.514
I'm sorry if I was in the way,

00:07:49.614 --> 00:07:51.585
I really didn't wanna
cause any trouble.

00:07:51.685 --> 00:07:53.756
- [Nana Komatsu] No, no, it was
my fault.

00:07:53.856 --> 00:07:54.390
- Huh?

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:56.394
- I called to apologize for last
night.

00:07:56.494 --> 00:07:57.062
I'm really sorry.

00:07:57.162 --> 00:07:59.768
I was in a bad mood yesterday
and I took it out on you.

00:07:59.868 --> 00:08:02.139
You're welcome to come
and visit us anytime.

00:08:02.239 --> 00:08:04.276
I know Nana and the guys
would love to see you.

00:08:04.376 --> 00:08:04.944
We'll be sure to let you know

00:08:05.045 --> 00:08:07.315
when the band's got
another gig booked, okay?

00:08:07.416 --> 00:08:08.519
- That'd be great.

00:08:08.619 --> 00:08:09.754
Thank you so much, Nana.
(gentle music)

00:08:09.854 --> 00:08:11.591
- [Nana Komatsu] Hey,
Misato, where are you now?

00:08:11.691 --> 00:08:14.296
- Right now I'm on the train
going home.

00:08:14.396 --> 00:08:15.331
- [Nana Komatsu] I see.

00:08:15.432 --> 00:08:17.002
Sorry, I didn't say goodbye.

00:08:17.102 --> 00:08:18.539
- Oh, don't worry about it.

00:08:18.639 --> 00:08:19.707
You're calling now, aren't you?

00:08:19.808 --> 00:08:22.312
I had the best time ever
getting to hang out with Blast

00:08:22.412 --> 00:08:23.414
and spending all that
time with Nana

00:08:23.515 --> 00:08:25.018
talking about all
kinds of things.

00:08:25.118 --> 00:08:27.089
I feel like I've been
in a dream.

00:08:27.189 --> 00:08:28.191
(Nana Komatsu laughs)

00:08:28.291 --> 00:08:29.226
- [Nana Komatsu] You're so
funny.

00:08:29.326 --> 00:08:30.796
- No, really I'm serious.

00:08:30.896 --> 00:08:33.401
I've been a huge fan ever
since the band started out

00:08:33.502 --> 00:08:35.472
but nothing like this
has ever happened before.

00:08:35.573 --> 00:08:37.977
I mean, I got to hang
out with them!

00:08:38.077 --> 00:08:39.012
- You really are a fan.

00:08:39.113 --> 00:08:41.618
So how long has it been
since they first started out?

00:08:41.718 --> 00:08:44.189
- [Misato] Well, it was back
when Ren was in the band

00:08:44.289 --> 00:08:45.626
and that was like
four years ago.

00:08:45.726 --> 00:08:48.030
(Nana Komatsu gasps)
- Ren was in the band?

00:08:48.131 --> 00:08:50.268
No, it couldn't be that Ren.

00:08:50.368 --> 00:08:52.940
- Yeah, it was a big
deal when Ren left Blast.

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.445
But don't you think
that new guy, Shin,

00:08:55.546 --> 00:08:57.015
plays a lot like him?

00:08:57.115 --> 00:09:00.956
So this show was just like
watching the old Blast again.

00:09:01.056 --> 00:09:03.394
It was totally amazing!

00:09:04.731 --> 00:09:05.198
(eerie music)

00:09:05.298 --> 00:09:07.068
- Tell me who your
favorite bass player is?

00:09:07.169 --> 00:09:08.337
- Ren Honjou.

00:09:08.438 --> 00:09:09.473
- [Misato] Yeah, and guess what?

00:09:09.574 --> 00:09:12.312
Soon I'm gonna see Trapnest
play a concert back home.

00:09:12.412 --> 00:09:15.051
I'm so psyched that
I get to see Ren live.

00:09:15.151 --> 00:09:17.456
It's been so long.

00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:18.926
- What made you choose a lotus
blossom?

00:09:19.026 --> 00:09:20.763
Does it have like a
special meaning?

00:09:20.863 --> 00:09:23.869
- Actually it's not a
lotus, it's a Ren flower.

00:09:25.138 --> 00:09:26.373
- Ren?

00:09:28.311 --> 00:09:29.480
No way!

00:09:34.591 --> 00:09:35.926
Okay, try to think.

00:09:36.026 --> 00:09:39.534
Ren from Trapnest used to
be the bass player in Blast.

00:09:39.634 --> 00:09:41.705
According to Misato, that is.

00:09:41.805 --> 00:09:43.274
Can it be true?

00:09:43.374 --> 00:09:44.878
But then why...

00:09:44.978 --> 00:09:48.886
Why hasn't Nana, Yasu, or Nobu
ever said anything about it?

00:09:48.986 --> 00:09:51.257
Even when Shin and I
were talking about Ren

00:09:51.357 --> 00:09:53.127
they didn't say anything.

00:09:53.227 --> 00:09:54.697
Why keep it a secret?

00:09:54.797 --> 00:09:56.835
And if Nana's tattoo is all
about Ren

00:09:56.935 --> 00:09:59.273
then the two of them must
be an item.

00:09:59.373 --> 00:10:00.108
(Nana Komatsu gasps)

00:10:00.208 --> 00:10:01.343
They're perfect together.

00:10:01.443 --> 00:10:03.381
This is just too cool!

00:10:03.481 --> 00:10:04.818
Now I get it.

00:10:04.918 --> 00:10:05.686
Ren's a big rock star!

00:10:05.786 --> 00:10:08.357
That's why everyone's
trying to keep it a secret.

00:10:08.457 --> 00:10:10.495
Now it's all starting to make
sense.

00:10:10.596 --> 00:10:12.332
The way Yasu acts calm and cool.

00:10:12.432 --> 00:10:15.438
The way Nana never talks
about herself.

00:10:15.539 --> 00:10:17.475
She goes out at night
saying she's working

00:10:17.577 --> 00:10:20.048
but is she secretly hooking
up with Ren?

00:10:20.148 --> 00:10:24.122
I mean, who goes to work wearing
expensive designer clothes?

00:10:24.223 --> 00:10:26.193
I wonder.

00:10:26.293 --> 00:10:27.462
It's gotta be true.

00:10:27.563 --> 00:10:28.832
What should I do?

00:10:28.932 --> 00:10:31.303
There's no way I can go back
to work now.

00:10:31.403 --> 00:10:31.872
I can't think straight.

00:10:31.972 --> 00:10:34.644
I've got to get to the bottom
of this!

00:10:34.744 --> 00:10:36.280
Nana won't be home until nine

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:37.917
and she doesn't have a
cell phone.

00:10:38.017 --> 00:10:41.023
Oh, what should I do?

00:10:42.827 --> 00:10:43.160
(Nobu sighs)

00:10:43.261 --> 00:10:45.566
- Well, to be honest, I don't
know if I should say anything.

00:10:45.666 --> 00:10:47.703
- Come on, Nobu,
you can tell me.

00:10:47.803 --> 00:10:48.872
You know everything, don't you?

00:10:48.972 --> 00:10:51.410
It's not like I'm gonna sell
the story to the tabloids

00:10:51.511 --> 00:10:52.245
or anything.

00:10:52.345 --> 00:10:52.980
- Of course you wouldn't.

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.951
You're not the type to
do something like that.

00:10:55.051 --> 00:10:55.986
The thing is, Hachi.

00:10:56.086 --> 00:10:57.122
- Don't call me Hachi.

00:10:57.222 --> 00:10:57.690
(Shin giggles)

00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:00.295
Shin, smoking stunts your
growth!

00:11:00.395 --> 00:11:02.165
I dunno why you're
being so damn smug.

00:11:02.265 --> 00:11:03.434
You know you worship Ren.

00:11:03.535 --> 00:11:05.305
- I already knew
about him and Nana.

00:11:05.405 --> 00:11:06.307
- What?
- What?

00:11:06.407 --> 00:11:07.342
- How'd you know?

00:11:07.442 --> 00:11:08.845
Don't tell me the reason
you joined the band

00:11:08.946 --> 00:11:11.417
is because you thought you
could follow in Ren's footsteps.

00:11:11.518 --> 00:11:12.820
- This was all a dirty plot.

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:15.124
- No, the truth is Nobu
told me everything

00:11:15.225 --> 00:11:16.193
when he was drunk.

00:11:16.293 --> 00:11:16.995
- I did?

00:11:17.095 --> 00:11:19.066
- [Shin] You don't remember?

00:11:19.166 --> 00:11:20.569
- No, not really.

00:11:20.669 --> 00:11:21.972
- It was just after
I joined the band.

00:11:22.072 --> 00:11:24.042
- But, Shin, why didn't you
tell me?

00:11:24.142 --> 00:11:25.813
You could have given me
some sort of clue.

00:11:25.913 --> 00:11:28.251
- Well, no one in the
band ever talks about Ren.

00:11:28.351 --> 00:11:29.219
It's like it's off limits.

00:11:29.319 --> 00:11:31.725
So I thought it'd be better
if I just kept my mouth shut

00:11:31.825 --> 00:11:33.595
and pretended I didn't know
anything.

00:11:33.695 --> 00:11:35.198
- I'm totally the worst.

00:11:35.298 --> 00:11:36.066
- That's so mature.

00:11:36.166 --> 00:11:38.304
There's no way I could have
kept something like that

00:11:38.404 --> 00:11:39.273
a secret for so long.

00:11:39.373 --> 00:11:41.878
Usually I freak out when I
hear about that kind of stuff.

00:11:41.978 --> 00:11:44.249
- That's one of the reasons
you're so cute, Hachi.

00:11:44.349 --> 00:11:46.521
- You think I'm cute?

00:11:46.621 --> 00:11:47.455
You shouldn't tease older women.

00:11:47.556 --> 00:11:49.794
- But I wasn't teasing
you, it's the truth.

00:11:49.894 --> 00:11:52.365
- It's been so long since
someone called me cute.

00:11:52.465 --> 00:11:53.034
- Hey, listen, Shin.

00:11:53.134 --> 00:11:55.739
I'm wondering what
I told you exactly.

00:11:55.839 --> 00:11:56.675
You tell me what you know

00:11:56.775 --> 00:11:58.745
and I promise to tell you the
whole story,

00:11:58.845 --> 00:12:01.785
'cause who knows what I might
have said when I was drunk.

00:12:01.885 --> 00:12:05.124
- You told me that Ren used to
be the bass player in Blast.

00:12:05.224 --> 00:12:07.195
He hooked up with Nana
and they lived together.

00:12:07.295 --> 00:12:08.497
But a couple of years ago

00:12:08.598 --> 00:12:10.068
he was offered the chance
to be the guitar player

00:12:10.168 --> 00:12:12.573
for Trapnest, so
he left for Tokyo

00:12:12.673 --> 00:12:14.510
and no one in the band
has heard from him since.

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:16.781
- Then I guess I said it all.

00:12:16.881 --> 00:12:17.315
- But, hold on.

00:12:17.415 --> 00:12:19.052
You said no one's
heard from him.

00:12:19.152 --> 00:12:19.787
Not even Nana?

00:12:19.887 --> 00:12:22.627
- They had a really tough
breakup, didn't they?

00:12:22.727 --> 00:12:23.695
- Yeah, that's about right.

00:12:23.795 --> 00:12:26.033
I really did tell you
everything that happened.

00:12:26.133 --> 00:12:27.737
- A tough breakup.

00:12:27.837 --> 00:12:29.406
But just because
Ren moved to Tokyo

00:12:29.507 --> 00:12:31.343
doesn't mean they
had to break up.

00:12:31.443 --> 00:12:32.780
- Yeah, I guess you're right.

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:34.316
You maintained a long
distance relationship

00:12:34.416 --> 00:12:36.588
with your boyfriend for a
while, didn't you, Hachi?

00:12:36.688 --> 00:12:38.692
- Yeah, but the thing is,

00:12:38.792 --> 00:12:42.399
things didn't work out between
us after I moved to Tokyo.

00:12:42.499 --> 00:12:43.100
- You mean the two
of you split up?

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.570
- You're not with your
boyfriend anymore?

00:12:44.671 --> 00:12:45.238
What happened?

00:12:45.338 --> 00:12:48.277
We went to see him at the
restaurant just the other day.

00:12:48.377 --> 00:12:50.248
- Yeah, I know.

00:12:50.348 --> 00:12:52.586
But right after that...

00:12:52.687 --> 00:12:54.724
Well, I don't wanna bore
you with my problems,

00:12:54.824 --> 00:12:56.528
but if you really wanna
know the details

00:12:56.628 --> 00:12:57.730
I'm sure I'll bitch all about it

00:12:57.830 --> 00:12:59.299
the next time we go drinking.

00:12:59.399 --> 00:13:00.168
- No thanks.

00:13:00.268 --> 00:13:00.969
No more booze for me.

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:03.174
- So there's something
to bitch about.

00:13:03.274 --> 00:13:04.209
Did that jerk cheat on you?

00:13:04.309 --> 00:13:05.478
(Nana gasps)

00:13:05.579 --> 00:13:06.748
Bullseye.

00:13:06.848 --> 00:13:07.048
- Look,

00:13:07.148 --> 00:13:08.952
I thought we were talking
about Ren and Nana's breakup.

00:13:09.052 --> 00:13:09.620
Not mine.

00:13:09.721 --> 00:13:11.591
- If you wanna know
personal stuff about Nana

00:13:11.691 --> 00:13:13.394
why don't you just ask her
yourself?

00:13:13.494 --> 00:13:15.298
- No way you can't do that.

00:13:15.398 --> 00:13:16.266
- But why not?

00:13:16.367 --> 00:13:17.035
- Well, you know,

00:13:17.135 --> 00:13:19.774
everyone's got a few
skeletons in their closet

00:13:19.874 --> 00:13:21.443
they don't want to talk about.

00:13:21.544 --> 00:13:23.447
- Was it really that
bad for her?

00:13:23.548 --> 00:13:24.884
- But if the breakup was
hard for them,

00:13:24.984 --> 00:13:26.988
doesn't that mean things
were actually going good

00:13:27.088 --> 00:13:27.623
up until then?

00:13:27.723 --> 00:13:29.426
- Well, yeah, sort of I guess.

00:13:29.527 --> 00:13:31.731
But, how can I put it?

00:13:31.831 --> 00:13:33.535
I'm not mad at Ren for
what he did

00:13:33.635 --> 00:13:35.171
and I really don't wanna
badmouth him.

00:13:35.271 --> 00:13:38.244
But what happened was Ren
decided to quit playing with
Blast

00:13:38.344 --> 00:13:38.979
and join Trapnest

00:13:39.079 --> 00:13:41.283
without discussing it
with Nana and me first.

00:13:41.383 --> 00:13:44.322
The only person he talked
it over with was Yasu.

00:13:44.423 --> 00:13:44.924
(somber music)

00:13:45.024 --> 00:13:47.395
So at the time I felt
totally betrayed.

00:13:47.495 --> 00:13:48.865
It was a real shock.

00:13:48.965 --> 00:13:50.334
The band was everything to me

00:13:50.435 --> 00:13:51.504
and I felt like he was saying

00:13:51.604 --> 00:13:53.307
we weren't good enough for him.

00:13:53.407 --> 00:13:54.811
Plus I guess I was jealous.

00:13:54.911 --> 00:13:57.348
Nana and I knew the
opportunity was too good

00:13:57.449 --> 00:14:00.455
for him to turn down and we
didn't wanna stand in his way.

00:14:00.556 --> 00:14:02.593
We had to respect what
the offer meant to him

00:14:02.693 --> 00:14:03.528
and his career.

00:14:03.628 --> 00:14:06.568
So we accepted his decision.

00:14:06.668 --> 00:14:09.106
I think it was the best thing
for him.

00:14:10.041 --> 00:14:11.544
But Nana...

00:14:13.548 --> 00:14:14.382
(Nobu sighs)

00:14:14.483 --> 00:14:17.255
Well Nana could have gone with
Ren,

00:14:17.355 --> 00:14:19.694
but she had too much pride

00:14:19.794 --> 00:14:23.300
to simply be the girlfriend
of a big rock star.

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:26.508
I think that's the main
reason why she's so focused

00:14:26.608 --> 00:14:28.879
on becoming a successful
musician.

00:14:28.979 --> 00:14:30.582
She's determined to be as big

00:14:30.682 --> 00:14:34.022
or even bigger than Ren
and Trapnest.

00:14:34.122 --> 00:14:37.730
- Play better than Ren,
all right?

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:41.069
- Sometimes it's hard to
watch her struggle with that.

00:14:42.506 --> 00:14:45.144
To be honest, I don't know if
Nona's still in love with Ren

00:14:45.244 --> 00:14:47.148
or if she has any feelings
for him.

00:14:47.248 --> 00:14:49.486
And Yasu and I would just
feel awkward

00:14:49.587 --> 00:14:50.354
if we brought up the subject,

00:14:50.455 --> 00:14:53.060
so we never say anything
about Ren in front of her.

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:56.300
It's not that we meant to keep
it a secret from you guys.

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.905
Listen, the two of you don't
have to go around pretending

00:14:59.005 --> 00:15:01.544
like you don't know what
happened between Nana and Ren

00:15:01.644 --> 00:15:02.312
but I think it would be best

00:15:02.412 --> 00:15:04.650
if you try to avoid
talking about 'em

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:06.788
whenever you're around her.

00:15:06.888 --> 00:15:09.694
- Yeah, I think I can do that.

00:15:10.929 --> 00:15:14.236
But the trouble is I've
already been talking about Ren

00:15:14.336 --> 00:15:16.541
when I was with Nana.

00:15:16.641 --> 00:15:18.244
- Miss Komatsu, it's three
o'clock!

00:15:18.344 --> 00:15:19.012
(Ms. Sakagami keeps yelling
incoherently)

00:15:19.112 --> 00:15:20.749
- Whenever I was babbling
on about Trapnest

00:15:20.849 --> 00:15:22.653
I was hurting Nana's pride.

00:15:22.753 --> 00:15:23.254
I didn't know I was doing it,

00:15:23.354 --> 00:15:25.926
but still it must have been
awful for her.

00:15:26.026 --> 00:15:28.698
No wonder she doesn't
wanna go see Trapnest.

00:15:28.798 --> 00:15:29.667
I'm gonna stop bugging her

00:15:29.767 --> 00:15:32.138
about coming to the
concert with me.

00:15:33.875 --> 00:15:35.512
- Well, I suppose as long as
you're sorry,

00:15:35.612 --> 00:15:37.482
I guess we can forget it.

00:15:37.583 --> 00:15:40.622
Just don't do it again, all
right?

00:15:40.722 --> 00:15:42.492
- Okay, I won't do it again.

00:15:42.593 --> 00:15:43.695
I don't wanna hurt her!

00:15:43.795 --> 00:15:48.170
Slowly and carefully
I'll ask her about Ren.

00:15:51.243 --> 00:15:53.080
- Did Yasu come over?

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:53.748
- Huh?

00:15:53.849 --> 00:15:55.351
- Aren't these Yasu's?

00:15:55.451 --> 00:15:59.226
What other maniac would smoke
these disgusting cigarettes?

00:15:59.326 --> 00:15:59.760
- Huh?

00:15:59.861 --> 00:16:01.598
Do you really think
they're that gross?

00:16:01.698 --> 00:16:03.334
I always think they smell nice
and sweet

00:16:03.434 --> 00:16:04.469
when he smokes them.

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:05.204
- Oh, really?

00:16:05.304 --> 00:16:08.077
- But anyway, those aren't
Yasu's, they're Shin's.

00:16:08.177 --> 00:16:09.614
I took them away from him.

00:16:09.714 --> 00:16:10.081
- What?

00:16:10.181 --> 00:16:13.053
That boy's life's
a total train wreck.

00:16:13.153 --> 00:16:16.260
- I don't want them, so you
might as well take them.

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.832
- No thanks, I never
smoke that kind of crap.

00:16:18.932 --> 00:16:19.800
We can save them up

00:16:19.901 --> 00:16:21.838
and give them the Yasu
when he comes over.

00:16:21.938 --> 00:16:24.342
So, anyway, when did
you see Shin?

00:16:24.442 --> 00:16:28.050
- Oh, I ran into him on
the way home from work.

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:29.386
- Oh?

00:16:29.486 --> 00:16:31.123
- Why am I lying?

00:16:31.223 --> 00:16:34.229
Why can't I just
be honest with her?

00:16:34.329 --> 00:16:35.699
- Sounds shady to me.

00:16:35.799 --> 00:16:37.268
You don't wanna hang
out with Shin.

00:16:37.368 --> 00:16:39.674
You know, he spends all his time
around those older women

00:16:39.774 --> 00:16:40.441
for their money.

00:16:40.542 --> 00:16:41.744
He'd probably use you too.

00:16:41.844 --> 00:16:43.447
- He's not like that at all!

00:16:43.548 --> 00:16:45.218
- Yeah, if you say so.

00:16:46.253 --> 00:16:49.459
By the way, did you ever call
Misato?

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:51.998
- [Misato] It was back
when Ren was in the band.

00:16:52.098 --> 00:16:53.434
- Yeah.

00:16:53.535 --> 00:16:55.271
- I just hope she got back okay.

00:16:55.371 --> 00:16:55.939
- Uh-huh.

00:16:56.039 --> 00:16:58.077
When I spoke to her, she
was on the train going home.

00:16:58.177 --> 00:16:59.880
- That's good.

00:17:04.422 --> 00:17:07.428
- Nana, I wanted to ask
you about Trapnest and Ren.

00:17:07.529 --> 00:17:08.531
- About the concert?

00:17:08.632 --> 00:17:09.967
I've decided to go with you.

00:17:10.067 --> 00:17:11.403
(Nana Komatsu gasps)

00:17:11.504 --> 00:17:12.773
- What, really?

00:17:12.873 --> 00:17:14.910
- I told you I'd go
if I felt like it.

00:17:15.011 --> 00:17:16.848
- How come you wanna go now?

00:17:16.948 --> 00:17:19.352
- Just because, no real reason.

00:17:19.452 --> 00:17:20.288
- Yeah, but-

00:17:20.388 --> 00:17:20.856
- Yeah but what?

00:17:20.956 --> 00:17:22.693
If you've already made plans
to go with someone else

00:17:22.793 --> 00:17:23.762
that's fine.

00:17:23.862 --> 00:17:24.730
- No, no, no, let's go together.

00:17:24.830 --> 00:17:27.736
I'd love for you to come
to the concert with me.

00:17:29.707 --> 00:17:30.976
Weird.

00:17:31.076 --> 00:17:34.517
I wonder if she wants
to see Ren after all.

00:17:34.617 --> 00:17:37.055
Is she still in love with him?

00:17:37.155 --> 00:17:38.424
(tab opens)
(funky music)

00:17:38.525 --> 00:17:41.496
I wanna ask her, but I
can't just blurt it out.

00:17:41.597 --> 00:17:42.298
And even if I did ask

00:17:42.398 --> 00:17:45.839
she probably wouldn't
tell me the truth anyway.

00:17:45.939 --> 00:17:47.375
All that would happen is I'd
embarrass her

00:17:47.475 --> 00:17:50.749
and then she wouldn't
go to the concert with me.

00:17:50.849 --> 00:17:53.855
Maybe I'll ask her after
the concert.

00:17:53.955 --> 00:17:55.659
I don't wanna mess things up.

00:17:55.759 --> 00:17:59.466
It's a golden opportunity for
them to see each other again!

00:17:59.567 --> 00:18:01.169
Front row seats.

00:18:01.269 --> 00:18:03.908
And it's a small concert hall.

00:18:04.009 --> 00:18:06.748
Ren's gonna spot her
in the crowd for sure!

00:18:06.848 --> 00:18:07.348
(crowd cheering)

00:18:07.448 --> 00:18:09.252
The girl he didn't wanna break
up with

00:18:09.352 --> 00:18:11.924
will be right up at the
front, staring at him.

00:18:12.025 --> 00:18:13.628
There's no way he'll miss her.

00:18:13.728 --> 00:18:14.496
Their eyes will meet.

00:18:14.597 --> 00:18:18.037
Tears will start to
roll down Nana's cheek.

00:18:18.137 --> 00:18:20.141
Ren will jump down from the
stage

00:18:20.241 --> 00:18:22.478
and scoop her up in his arms.

00:18:22.579 --> 00:18:23.882
So romantic!

00:18:23.982 --> 00:18:25.318
I won't say a word.

00:18:25.418 --> 00:18:27.088
At least until after
the concert.

00:18:27.188 --> 00:18:29.392
I don't want Nana to change
her mind.

00:18:29.492 --> 00:18:30.862
I'll play totally dumb.

00:18:30.962 --> 00:18:32.231
It's a genius plan!

00:18:32.332 --> 00:18:35.171
All for the sake of
their big reunion.

00:18:38.143 --> 00:18:40.414
- I have no problem keeping
my mouth shut.

00:18:40.515 --> 00:18:43.454
I've been acting like I
didn't know anything anyway.

00:18:43.555 --> 00:18:44.790
- That's awesome, Shin, thanks!

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:46.026
- I can't believe you got front
row.

00:18:46.126 --> 00:18:48.698
With seat like that, I
wanna go to the concert too.

00:18:48.798 --> 00:18:50.869
- Sorry, I've only got
two tickets.

00:18:50.969 --> 00:18:52.338
- But, I'm wondering, is
their reunion

00:18:52.438 --> 00:18:54.977
really gonna be as big and
dramatic as you think, Hachi?

00:18:55.077 --> 00:18:56.446
- Well, maybe Ren jumping off
the stage

00:18:56.547 --> 00:18:58.450
and sweeping her
into his arms is a bit much.

00:18:58.551 --> 00:19:00.622
- Do you think he still
has feelings for Nana

00:19:00.722 --> 00:19:01.524
after all this time?

00:19:01.624 --> 00:19:04.897
I mean, they haven't spoken
for two years, right?

00:19:04.997 --> 00:19:05.766
- Well, yeah.

00:19:05.866 --> 00:19:07.669
I'm not too sure about him.

00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:09.573
He's kind of like, well,
you know...

00:19:09.673 --> 00:19:11.511
- He's kind of like what?

00:19:11.611 --> 00:19:13.313
- I heard he gets around?

00:19:13.414 --> 00:19:14.282
- Really?

00:19:14.382 --> 00:19:16.687
- Well, he used to be
like that in the past,

00:19:16.788 --> 00:19:17.790
but he's changed.

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:20.562
Once he met Nana, he was
totally devoted to her.

00:19:20.662 --> 00:19:21.831
You know that little padlock

00:19:21.931 --> 00:19:23.300
he wears around his neck all the
time?

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.572
That's something Nana gave to
him.

00:19:26.473 --> 00:19:27.175
- Are you kidding me?

00:19:27.275 --> 00:19:29.513
That's proof he's still in love
with her.

00:19:29.613 --> 00:19:30.381
- I don't know about that.

00:19:30.481 --> 00:19:32.385
Maybe he just wears it 'cause he
likes it

00:19:32.485 --> 00:19:33.287
and it's fashionable.

00:19:33.387 --> 00:19:33.955
- Oh, come on,

00:19:34.055 --> 00:19:35.692
you know it's gotta be
a symbol of their love.

00:19:35.792 --> 00:19:37.930
Yasu, back me up on this.

00:19:39.934 --> 00:19:40.769
- Yeah, all right.

00:19:40.869 --> 00:19:42.371
I agree with you.

00:19:42.472 --> 00:19:43.474
- Yes, I knew it!

00:19:43.575 --> 00:19:44.075
(door opens)

00:19:44.175 --> 00:19:46.748
(Nana Komatsu gasps)
(Nobu gasps)

00:19:46.848 --> 00:19:47.983
- Is there something wrong?

00:19:48.083 --> 00:19:49.720
- Okay, everyone, time for
practice.

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:51.123
Let's rock the house.

00:19:51.223 --> 00:19:53.227
- Okay, that was totally lame.

00:19:53.327 --> 00:19:54.195
(drum sticks keeping beat)

00:19:54.295 --> 00:19:56.366
- [Nana Komatsu] That was
two weeks before the concert.

00:19:56.466 --> 00:19:56.868
(rock music)

00:19:56.968 --> 00:20:00.107
I was so worried Nana would
change her mind about coming.

00:20:00.207 --> 00:20:03.982
I couldn't stop my
imagination from running wild.

00:20:04.082 --> 00:20:06.521
If Nana and Ren get back
together,

00:20:06.621 --> 00:20:09.025
that means Trapnest might
come over to our place

00:20:09.125 --> 00:20:10.127
and hang out!

00:20:10.227 --> 00:20:13.768
And I could start going
out with Takumi!

00:20:13.868 --> 00:20:15.806
Ah, and then what will happen?

00:20:15.906 --> 00:20:17.074
(Nana Komatsu giggles)

00:20:17.175 --> 00:20:20.080
- Miss Komatsu, what on
earth is wrong with you?

00:20:22.051 --> 00:20:25.124
(keys clacking)

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:32.004
(lighter flickers)

00:20:32.104 --> 00:20:33.942
(Yasu exhales)

00:20:34.042 --> 00:20:36.480
(dinging)

00:20:36.581 --> 00:20:38.818
(Yasu sighs)

00:20:38.918 --> 00:20:41.691
(footsteps)

00:20:41.791 --> 00:20:42.759
- Hello?

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:44.663
- [Ren] Here I am.

00:20:45.866 --> 00:20:46.868
(door opens)

00:20:46.968 --> 00:20:48.972
- Okay, so here you are again.

00:20:49.072 --> 00:20:50.007
It's late.

00:20:50.107 --> 00:20:51.009
What do you want?

00:20:51.109 --> 00:20:53.313
(intense music)

00:20:53.413 --> 00:20:55.217
- [Nana Komatsu] It was the
morning before the concert,

00:20:55.317 --> 00:20:58.123
Nana, and you were sitting by
the window

00:20:58.223 --> 00:21:00.094
just like you always did.

00:21:00.194 --> 00:21:03.601
But something smelled
different in the room.

00:21:03.701 --> 00:21:06.741
It was the cigarettes I'd taken
from Shin.

00:21:06.841 --> 00:21:09.179
The smell of Blast.

00:21:09.279 --> 00:21:12.185
Which you said you didn't smoke.
