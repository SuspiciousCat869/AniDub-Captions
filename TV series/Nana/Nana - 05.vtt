WEBVTT

00:00:01.971 --> 00:00:05.010
(mellow music)

00:00:09.616 --> 00:00:12.120
- [Nana] It's hard to describe
in words

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.424
what came over me that night.

00:00:14.525 --> 00:00:18.399
It wasn't as simple as love
or excitement,

00:00:21.071 --> 00:00:24.444
more like jealousy mixed
in with envy

00:00:25.848 --> 00:00:27.250
and lust.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.396
I still get insecure every now
and then

00:00:33.496 --> 00:00:35.868
because it feels like
every day I spend with Ren

00:00:35.968 --> 00:00:37.605
is nothing but a dream.

00:00:41.011 --> 00:00:43.049
Ren was a glamorous, bright
light

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:46.155
shining into my boring mundane
world.

00:00:47.157 --> 00:00:49.962
But no matter how hard I tried,

00:00:50.063 --> 00:00:53.537
he always seemed to be
out of my reach.

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:58.279
(wind blowing)

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.757
- Nana, I'm going to Tokyo

00:01:07.765 --> 00:01:10.704
so you can live your life
however you want

00:01:17.183 --> 00:01:20.591
(upbeat rock music)

00:03:05.233 --> 00:03:06.335
- Tokyo?

00:03:06.435 --> 00:03:07.972
What do you mean Tokyo?

00:03:08.072 --> 00:03:09.909
What about college? Law school?

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:12.280
I thought you were gonna become
a lawyer?

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.482
- I'm not talking about me.

00:03:13.583 --> 00:03:15.052
I'm talking about Ren.

00:03:15.153 --> 00:03:16.255
Look, you remember that band?

00:03:16.355 --> 00:03:19.060
You know the one that Ren
and I used to go up against

00:03:19.161 --> 00:03:19.662
in battle of the bands?

00:03:19.762 --> 00:03:21.699
They were called Trapnest.

00:03:23.102 --> 00:03:24.806
- Trapnest.

00:03:24.906 --> 00:03:26.208
Yeah, I remember them.

00:03:26.308 --> 00:03:27.143
Weren't they the ones that had

00:03:27.243 --> 00:03:29.615
that really cool girl on lead
vocals.

00:03:29.715 --> 00:03:30.984
- Yeah. We used to hang out with
them

00:03:31.084 --> 00:03:33.289
and go out drinking
together, stuff like that.

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:34.892
They left for Tokyo a couple
years ago

00:03:34.992 --> 00:03:36.663
to see if they could
make it professionally

00:03:36.763 --> 00:03:37.998
and move paid off for them.

00:03:38.098 --> 00:03:40.136
They landed themselves
a recording contract

00:03:40.236 --> 00:03:41.004
with a big label.

00:03:41.104 --> 00:03:43.475
- Really? No way.

00:03:43.577 --> 00:03:45.614
They sure are lucky. I can't
believe it.

00:03:45.714 --> 00:03:47.952
- [Yasu] They were just about
to release their first single

00:03:48.052 --> 00:03:49.187
and then came the problems.

00:03:49.287 --> 00:03:50.991
The guitarist quit.

00:03:51.091 --> 00:03:51.626
- Oh.

00:03:51.726 --> 00:03:52.895
- [Yasu] So the rest of
the band got together

00:03:52.995 --> 00:03:55.667
and decided they'd asked Ren to
join them.

00:03:57.805 --> 00:04:00.409
Ren left this morning for Tokyo
to meet with the producers

00:04:00.511 --> 00:04:02.213
but they've already approved his
demo

00:04:02.313 --> 00:04:04.417
so this is just a formality,

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:06.723
a chance for them to see him
face to face.

00:04:06.823 --> 00:04:08.727
It's practically a done deal.

00:04:09.361 --> 00:04:10.463
- Wait a minute.

00:04:10.564 --> 00:04:13.670
- Hey, he hasn't made
the move to Tokyo yet.

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.308
He'll be back in town
tomorrow for a while.

00:04:16.408 --> 00:04:18.445
- But he is moving to Tokyo,
right?

00:04:18.547 --> 00:04:19.615
What about Blast?

00:04:19.715 --> 00:04:21.553
What are we gonna do?

00:04:21.653 --> 00:04:23.623
We've only been together
for a year and a half.

00:04:23.723 --> 00:04:25.961
We were just starting to get
somewhere.

00:04:26.061 --> 00:04:27.130
I don't believe it.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:28.667
- Nah, don't worry.

00:04:28.767 --> 00:04:31.940
It'll be easy for us to
find another bass player.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.277
They're a dime a dozen

00:04:34.377 --> 00:04:37.016
- [Nobu] But I just
don't get it.

00:04:38.653 --> 00:04:41.124
It feels like we've
been screwed over.

00:04:43.362 --> 00:04:45.066
- Listen. He's been sitting
around

00:04:45.166 --> 00:04:46.903
going nowhere in this town.

00:04:47.003 --> 00:04:48.740
It's a total waste

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.243
- Huh?

00:04:50.343 --> 00:04:51.813
Then why don't we all go to
Tokyo

00:04:51.913 --> 00:04:53.717
and see if we can make it as
pros?

00:04:53.817 --> 00:04:56.756
Look out, Tokyo here
comes Blast.

00:04:56.856 --> 00:04:57.858
- [Yasu] Sorry, but I don't plan

00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:00.931
on trying to earn my
living from music.

00:05:01.031 --> 00:05:03.435
I'm not going to gamble
my life away like that.

00:05:03.536 --> 00:05:05.807
Besides, even if
we did move to Tokyo,

00:05:05.908 --> 00:05:08.914
Ren has to make Trapnest his
priority now.

00:05:09.014 --> 00:05:10.483
- I don't see why.

00:05:10.584 --> 00:05:11.653
- Because we have no guarantee

00:05:11.753 --> 00:05:14.124
that we'd get signed
by a record label.

00:05:14.224 --> 00:05:15.393
- But we don't know till we try.

00:05:15.493 --> 00:05:17.363
- Doesn't matter
how hard you try,

00:05:17.463 --> 00:05:19.769
most bands just don't make it.

00:05:19.869 --> 00:05:22.440
I don't want that
to happen to Ren.

00:05:22.541 --> 00:05:25.079
This is a once in a
lifetime chance.

00:05:25.179 --> 00:05:27.952
He'd be stupid not to go for it.

00:05:28.052 --> 00:05:29.889
- Anyway, just 'cause Trapnest
lucked out

00:05:29.989 --> 00:05:32.594
with a recording contract
doesn't necessarily mean

00:05:32.695 --> 00:05:33.964
they're gonna hit the big time.

00:05:34.064 --> 00:05:34.899
- They'll do fine.

00:05:34.999 --> 00:05:36.836
They have everything
going for them.

00:05:36.936 --> 00:05:38.205
They have a great luck,
a great sound,

00:05:38.305 --> 00:05:41.144
and once they add Ren to the
mix, they've got it made.

00:05:41.244 --> 00:05:44.050
- [Nobu] Well. Yeah, but-
- You just don't get it.

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:45.887
If you wanna go to Tokyo, go,

00:05:45.988 --> 00:05:48.425
but don't even try to stand in
Ren's way.

00:05:48.526 --> 00:05:50.664
Besides, one day you'll
inherit the family inn

00:05:50.764 --> 00:05:51.532
from your parents.

00:05:51.633 --> 00:05:53.536
So you don't have
to worry about a job

00:05:53.637 --> 00:05:55.272
or making ends meet.

00:05:55.373 --> 00:05:57.010
Quit dreaming about
becoming a pro.

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.715
You can't do that and
run the family business.

00:05:59.815 --> 00:06:02.387
You should just treat the
band as a side project.

00:06:02.487 --> 00:06:05.694
- But, what's Nana gonna do?

00:06:08.667 --> 00:06:11.138
He won't just abandon her.

00:06:12.073 --> 00:06:12.608
(Yasu scoffs)

00:06:12.708 --> 00:06:15.547
- [Yasu] That's a screwed
up way to look at it.

00:06:15.647 --> 00:06:18.218
- [Nobu] He's gotta
take her with him.

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:19.588
- What's with the attitude?

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:21.191
"He won't just abandon her."

00:06:21.291 --> 00:06:23.930
It's not like she's a pet
kitten that belongs to him.

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:25.567
- Huh?
- You know, as well as I do

00:06:25.667 --> 00:06:27.738
that Nana's a strong,
independent woman.

00:06:27.838 --> 00:06:30.610
If she wants to go with
him to Tokyo, she will.

00:06:30.711 --> 00:06:32.514
It's her decision.

00:06:32.614 --> 00:06:34.752
I'm sure Ren's thought about it.

00:06:35.587 --> 00:06:38.693
- Yasu, you're really mature.

00:06:38.793 --> 00:06:40.831
- And you're still a little kid.

00:06:43.503 --> 00:06:46.542
You know, if Nana does
decide to go to Tokyo

00:06:46.642 --> 00:06:50.082
then that'll be the end
of Blast for sure.

00:06:50.182 --> 00:06:53.857
It'd be hard on all of
us, but that'd be it.

00:06:55.126 --> 00:06:57.865
It would be time for me
to pack it in.

00:06:57.965 --> 00:06:59.267
If you want the band to continue

00:06:59.367 --> 00:07:01.204
you have to find new members.

00:07:01.304 --> 00:07:02.508
It's up to you.

00:07:10.289 --> 00:07:13.596
(birds chirping)

00:07:13.696 --> 00:07:15.032
- [Nana] The second time I met
Ren,

00:07:15.132 --> 00:07:16.969
it was a beautiful summer
afternoon

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:20.911
with a warm motion breeze
gently crossing my skin.

00:07:21.011 --> 00:07:23.750
- [Ren] Hey, Nobu, you
want to be in a band?

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:25.687
- Huh? What do you mean, Ren?

00:07:25.787 --> 00:07:27.390
You're in a band.

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:29.227
- We decided to break up.

00:07:29.327 --> 00:07:30.262
Those guys really suck.

00:07:30.362 --> 00:07:32.601
They'd be okay if they
spent more time practicing

00:07:32.701 --> 00:07:35.206
unless I'm bitchin' and
moaning whenever we rehearse.

00:07:35.306 --> 00:07:35.907
Losers.

00:07:36.007 --> 00:07:37.878
- Hey, Nobu, didn't
you used to play guitar

00:07:37.978 --> 00:07:40.015
a bit back when we were in
junior high?

00:07:40.116 --> 00:07:42.788
I seem to remember Ren
saying you were pretty good.

00:07:42.888 --> 00:07:44.491
You didn't quit playing, did
you?

00:07:44.592 --> 00:07:45.025
- What?

00:07:45.126 --> 00:07:46.461
- [Ren] I can always switch to
bass

00:07:46.562 --> 00:07:47.765
then you could play guitar.

00:07:47.865 --> 00:07:49.033
- Sure. I'll do it.

00:07:49.134 --> 00:07:51.004
- Yeah, but can we risk using
someone

00:07:51.104 --> 00:07:52.775
who hasn't played in a year and
a half?

00:07:52.875 --> 00:07:54.210
Do you think you're up for it?

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:55.781
- Oh, I am so up for it.

00:07:55.881 --> 00:07:57.483
I know I haven't been playing in
a band

00:07:57.584 --> 00:07:59.087
but I still play every day at
home,

00:07:59.187 --> 00:08:01.091
and I know all your songs off by
heart.

00:08:01.191 --> 00:08:03.228
I even started writing some of
my own.

00:08:03.328 --> 00:08:04.532
You want to hear one of them?

00:08:04.632 --> 00:08:05.634
- All right. You're in.

00:08:05.734 --> 00:08:07.370
- So what about vocals?

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:09.274
Who's gonna sing?

00:08:09.374 --> 00:08:11.846
- Yeah. That's sort of
a problem right now.

00:08:11.946 --> 00:08:13.382
I'd like to get a girl on
vocals.

00:08:13.482 --> 00:08:16.488
I'm sick and tired of guys
who can't sing with a damn.

00:08:16.589 --> 00:08:17.658
- Yeah, I agree.

00:08:17.758 --> 00:08:19.093
Obviously we want a girl who can
sing,

00:08:19.194 --> 00:08:21.732
but it'd be a bonus if
she looked good too.

00:08:21.833 --> 00:08:23.235
- Nobu, a woman.

00:08:23.335 --> 00:08:25.239
Go find us a woman.

00:08:25.339 --> 00:08:26.709
The hotter, the better.

00:08:26.809 --> 00:08:28.145
- Why do I have to do it?

00:08:28.245 --> 00:08:31.384
You're the one who's surrounded
by women all the time, Ren.

00:08:31.485 --> 00:08:32.286
- You don't have a clue, do you?

00:08:32.386 --> 00:08:35.126
We can't let a girl I've
slept with join the band.

00:08:35.226 --> 00:08:35.894
We'd be in trouble.

00:08:35.994 --> 00:08:37.998
It would ruin everything.

00:08:38.098 --> 00:08:39.000
- Maybe it'd be different

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:41.639
if you were actually
in love with the girl.

00:08:41.739 --> 00:08:42.541
(Ren scoffs)

00:08:42.641 --> 00:08:43.175
- [Ren] Love?

00:08:43.275 --> 00:08:45.647
- If you laugh at love,
love will make you cry.

00:08:45.747 --> 00:08:47.918
- [Mom] Nobu, there's a
friend here to see you.

00:08:48.018 --> 00:08:50.924
It's Nana. Is it okay for her to
come up?

00:08:51.024 --> 00:08:53.530
- Yeah, sure thing. Thanks, mom.

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:55.466
- Did she say Nana?

00:08:55.567 --> 00:08:56.234
A girl?

00:08:56.334 --> 00:08:57.036
- [Ren] Is she hot?

00:08:57.136 --> 00:09:01.244
- Huh? Yeah, but it's not like
you've never seen her before.

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:04.618
Hey, Nana.

00:09:04.718 --> 00:09:08.125
(upbeat rock music)

00:09:12.835 --> 00:09:15.139
- [Nana] Nobuo, here's the CD I
borrowed.

00:09:15.239 --> 00:09:16.007
Thanks.

00:09:16.107 --> 00:09:17.544
- Sure thing.

00:09:17.644 --> 00:09:19.047
- [Nana] Well, better get going

00:09:19.147 --> 00:09:20.382
- Huh?

00:09:20.482 --> 00:09:21.117
Hey, Nana.

00:09:21.218 --> 00:09:24.558
- [Ren] Nobu, have you ever
gone to karaoke with her?

00:09:24.658 --> 00:09:27.496
- Huh?
- Can she sing?

00:09:27.598 --> 00:09:29.602
- [Nobu] Yeah. She's decent.

00:09:29.702 --> 00:09:31.137
- [Ren] All right then.

00:09:36.014 --> 00:09:37.651
- [Nana] From that day on,

00:09:37.751 --> 00:09:39.822
I was like the oceans tide,

00:09:39.922 --> 00:09:43.228
hold by the
gravitational force of Ren.

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:46.936
My heart floated on the waves,

00:09:47.036 --> 00:09:49.942
higher and higher and higher.

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:09.882
- Nana, will you sing
in our band?

00:10:22.741 --> 00:10:25.847
- [Nana] This gave voice
to my innermost desires.

00:10:28.485 --> 00:10:30.924
But I wasn't singing for Ren,

00:10:35.032 --> 00:10:37.638
I sing only for myself.

00:10:37.738 --> 00:10:40.409
Always have, always will.

00:10:58.546 --> 00:10:59.447
(Nana scoffs)

00:10:59.548 --> 00:11:00.984
- Check this out.

00:11:02.486 --> 00:11:03.690
It's my diploma.

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:05.159
Are you jealous?

00:11:07.063 --> 00:11:09.935
And look, I sold every
button on my uniform.

00:11:10.035 --> 00:11:12.173
Being the guitar player in Blast
rocks.

00:11:12.273 --> 00:11:14.979
You'll never guess how much
I got for the second button.

00:11:15.079 --> 00:11:17.216
- You got money for that?

00:11:17.316 --> 00:11:18.118
Get outta here.

00:11:18.218 --> 00:11:19.788
Can't you see? I'm busy, shrimp.

00:11:19.888 --> 00:11:21.726
- Hmm. Yeah, right.

00:11:21.826 --> 00:11:23.863
There's not a single
customer in the store.

00:11:23.963 --> 00:11:25.065
How on earth can you be busy?

00:11:25.165 --> 00:11:26.969
- [Nana] Because I'm reading a
book.

00:11:27.069 --> 00:11:28.740
You should consider
trying one yourself

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:31.746
instead of reading all
that manga.

00:11:31.846 --> 00:11:33.883
- [Nobu] I heard the news
about Ren.

00:11:33.983 --> 00:11:35.119
What are you gonna do?

00:11:35.219 --> 00:11:37.490
You gonna move to Tokyo
with him?

00:11:39.862 --> 00:11:40.429
- Hmm.

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:42.968
So you came here to try
and stop me from going?

00:11:43.068 --> 00:11:44.905
Will you miss me?

00:11:46.509 --> 00:11:50.082
- [Nobu] Fine. Go to
Tokyo and I'll go too.

00:11:50.182 --> 00:11:51.384
- What are you talking about?

00:11:51.484 --> 00:11:53.355
- Well, we can always
find new members

00:11:53.455 --> 00:11:54.591
for the band in Tokyo.

00:11:54.692 --> 00:11:56.595
Let's see how far we can
take this thing.

00:11:56.696 --> 00:11:59.768
I'm not saying it's gonna
be easy for us to go pro

00:11:59.868 --> 00:12:02.073
but it's gotta be worth a try.

00:12:02.173 --> 00:12:04.745
And you know, with your
voice we can make it.

00:12:04.845 --> 00:12:06.414
Okay. It's not the best voice in
the world

00:12:06.515 --> 00:12:09.822
but it's got this unique, cool
husky quality to it.

00:12:09.922 --> 00:12:13.362
I think we can do it, so
I say let's go for it.

00:12:13.462 --> 00:12:17.069
Besides, I don't wanna
play for any other singer.

00:12:18.639 --> 00:12:20.142
Yasu feels the same way.

00:12:20.242 --> 00:12:22.914
He's ready to quit for good
if you leave

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:27.323
- [Nana] Don't say that.

00:12:27.423 --> 00:12:29.895
- Huh?

00:12:29.995 --> 00:12:31.999
- [Nana] Those were the words I,

00:12:32.099 --> 00:12:34.237
I wanted to hear from Ren.

00:12:36.709 --> 00:12:41.217
Thanks Nobu, but I'm not going.

00:12:41.819 --> 00:12:42.453
- But why not?

00:12:42.554 --> 00:12:44.992
You're not planning to
split up with Ren, are you?

00:12:45.092 --> 00:12:46.494
Even if you two aren't
in the same band

00:12:46.595 --> 00:12:48.700
there's nothing to stop
you from living together.

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:49.735
- [Nana] I can't do that.

00:12:49.835 --> 00:12:51.071
- Huh?

00:12:51.906 --> 00:12:53.810
Nana, it's all right.

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:56.314
I know Ren and I know
that if you go with him,

00:12:56.414 --> 00:12:58.619
he's never gonna feel
like you're in the way.

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:01.491
He's always been a womanizer,
but he never cheated on you.

00:13:01.592 --> 00:13:02.159
Not once.

00:13:02.259 --> 00:13:05.633
That just proves how much
he's in love with you.

00:13:05.734 --> 00:13:07.136
- [Nana] I know that.

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:10.744
- As long as you know, and
that's good.

00:13:10.844 --> 00:13:12.547
- Listen. My life does
not revolve

00:13:12.647 --> 00:13:14.618
around sleeping with Ren. Okay?

00:13:15.954 --> 00:13:17.824
I want it so much.

00:13:17.924 --> 00:13:19.762
I wanna be a real singer

00:13:19.862 --> 00:13:21.264
(Nobu gasps)

00:13:21.364 --> 00:13:23.503
- In that case,
let's go to Tokyo.

00:13:23.603 --> 00:13:24.905
- [Nana] Not now.

00:13:25.974 --> 00:13:27.544
- Why the hell not?

00:13:27.644 --> 00:13:29.748
Sometimes I just don't
understand you, Nana.

00:13:29.848 --> 00:13:31.117
- If I decide to go now,

00:13:31.217 --> 00:13:33.088
I'll just end up living
with Ren again.

00:13:33.188 --> 00:13:35.727
I can't see how I can be
there and not live with him.

00:13:35.827 --> 00:13:36.428
(Nobu sighs)

00:13:36.529 --> 00:13:38.833
- [Nobu] And the problem
with that would be what?

00:13:38.933 --> 00:13:40.703
- I'd be waiting around
for my big break to come

00:13:40.804 --> 00:13:43.141
while he was off busy living
the life of a rock star

00:13:43.241 --> 00:13:45.145
and a band that has a
better singer than me.

00:13:45.245 --> 00:13:47.216
I don't wanna be a housewife
making dinner

00:13:47.316 --> 00:13:48.218
waiting for him to come home

00:13:48.318 --> 00:13:50.389
and complete my sad little
existence.

00:13:50.489 --> 00:13:52.761
(Nobu gasps)

00:13:52.861 --> 00:13:55.098
He'll never see me doing that.

00:13:57.203 --> 00:13:59.307
I would rather die.

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:02.581
So I'm gonna stay here.

00:14:02.681 --> 00:14:03.549
Take a bunch of singing lessons

00:14:03.649 --> 00:14:06.054
until I've got the confidence
to make it as a singer

00:14:06.154 --> 00:14:09.093
without having to depend on
Ren's help.

00:14:09.193 --> 00:14:13.335
And then one day, I'll
move to Tokyo on my own.

00:14:17.176 --> 00:14:18.345
Sorry, Nobu.

00:14:18.445 --> 00:14:22.052
You're gonna have to stick
around with me until then, okay?

00:14:22.821 --> 00:14:23.823
- You saying you can't sing

00:14:23.923 --> 00:14:25.693
unless I'm playing
guitar for you?

00:14:25.793 --> 00:14:27.229
- No, not really.

00:14:28.265 --> 00:14:29.200
- Are you sure you can't sing
- No,

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:32.106
- without me?
- not really.

00:14:36.481 --> 00:14:38.619
Ren and I got together
about a year and a half

00:14:38.719 --> 00:14:40.122
after we first met.

00:14:40.222 --> 00:14:41.725
It was Christmas night.

00:14:43.028 --> 00:14:44.731
We had just finished playing a
gig

00:14:44.832 --> 00:14:46.134
and we were feeling pretty good.

00:14:46.234 --> 00:14:47.904
On the way home We went by the
breakwater

00:14:48.004 --> 00:14:50.475
and started goofing around in
the snow.

00:14:53.014 --> 00:14:56.655
(Ren grunts)
(Nana laughing)

00:14:56.755 --> 00:14:57.824
A homemade cake?

00:14:57.924 --> 00:14:59.493
Aw, I feel so special.

00:14:59.595 --> 00:15:01.164
Let's eat.

00:15:01.264 --> 00:15:02.634
- What if it's poisoned?

00:15:02.734 --> 00:15:04.705
It could be from one of my fans,
you know?

00:15:04.805 --> 00:15:07.309
It could be one of those "You've
been getting it on with Ren

00:15:07.409 --> 00:15:09.615
so now you have to die" cakes.

00:15:09.715 --> 00:15:11.251
- Then you taste it first.

00:15:11.351 --> 00:15:12.486
I don't wanna be killed
by some freak

00:15:12.587 --> 00:15:14.791
for something that
I'm not even doing.

00:15:14.892 --> 00:15:16.662
- I don't want you too either.

00:15:20.335 --> 00:15:23.910
(slow romantic music)

00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:24.845
- [Nana] It happened so fast

00:15:24.945 --> 00:15:26.782
I forgot to close my eyes.

00:15:31.692 --> 00:15:34.898
- Now that we're guilty
of doing something

00:15:34.998 --> 00:15:37.269
I can die with a clean
conscience.

00:15:40.777 --> 00:15:43.583
- [Nana] That moment I
would've died with him.

00:15:45.853 --> 00:15:47.557
I wanted Ren.

00:15:47.657 --> 00:15:50.597
I wanted him so badly I
couldn't control myself.

00:15:53.301 --> 00:15:56.441
It's been that way ever
since that very first night.

00:15:58.311 --> 00:15:58.980
Didn't you say that none of you

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:02.787
should get involved with me
for the sake of the band?

00:16:07.363 --> 00:16:11.739
- It's okay. Because
there's love right here.

00:16:11.839 --> 00:16:13.475
- [Nana] Are you serious?

00:16:20.122 --> 00:16:22.761
We didn't waste any
time moving in together.

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:31.845
Ren showed me what a joy
it was to sing.

00:16:34.685 --> 00:16:37.289
He taught me how
to play the guitar.

00:16:38.325 --> 00:16:40.596
He gave me the
inspiration to live.

00:16:45.072 --> 00:16:47.744
But what did I have
to offer him?

00:16:47.844 --> 00:16:49.480
Maybe if I quit singing,

00:16:53.254 --> 00:16:56.361
then I could move to
Tokyo and be with him.

00:16:56.461 --> 00:16:59.266
I could make dinner for
both of us every day,

00:17:00.837 --> 00:17:02.674
keep the apartment clean,

00:17:06.214 --> 00:17:09.521
and eventually have
his children.

00:17:11.592 --> 00:17:13.562
Is that what I should be doing?

00:17:14.865 --> 00:17:18.171
Wouldn't that be more than
enough to make me happy?

00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:22.814
Neither of us have a family.

00:17:22.914 --> 00:17:26.254
So what could be better than
creating a family of our own

00:17:26.354 --> 00:17:29.260
instead of chasing after
some dream.

00:17:37.176 --> 00:17:38.612
- [Nobu] Is that all
you're taking with you?

00:17:38.713 --> 00:17:40.917
- Yeah. A guitar and a pack of
cigarettes

00:17:41.017 --> 00:17:42.252
is all I need to survive.

00:17:42.353 --> 00:17:42.821
- Yeah, right.

00:17:42.921 --> 00:17:44.624
He shipped his stuff
ahead 'cause he is a wimp

00:17:44.725 --> 00:17:46.829
and he can't handle
carrying anything heavy.

00:17:46.929 --> 00:17:49.835
- Too bad you won't have me
around a lug your stuff for you.

00:17:49.935 --> 00:17:52.339
- I'm sure he'll find some
other sucker to boss around.

00:17:52.439 --> 00:17:56.247
Poor guy won't know what
he'll have to suffer through.

00:17:56.347 --> 00:17:58.753
- I guess it's about time to go.

00:17:59.654 --> 00:18:02.393
(Nobu sighs)

00:18:04.931 --> 00:18:06.167
- Huh?

00:18:13.649 --> 00:18:16.522
(Nobu coughing)

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:28.779
(bell rings)

00:18:38.398 --> 00:18:39.266
(Nobu panting)

00:18:39.366 --> 00:18:41.137
(train honking)

00:18:41.237 --> 00:18:44.276
(Nana sobbing)

00:18:46.247 --> 00:18:47.049
(Nobu gasps)

00:18:47.149 --> 00:18:49.988
(mellow music)

00:18:54.096 --> 00:18:57.469
- After a year and three
months of living with Ren,

00:18:57.570 --> 00:18:59.306
right around the beginning of
spring,

00:18:59.407 --> 00:19:02.312
before the snow had
completely melted away,

00:19:02.413 --> 00:19:03.682
it was over.

00:19:07.289 --> 00:19:09.460
We never actually said
it was finished,

00:19:09.561 --> 00:19:10.897
but we both knew that living
apart

00:19:10.997 --> 00:19:14.470
would mean the end of
our relationship.

00:19:14.571 --> 00:19:17.777
We could have phoned each
other or written letters.

00:19:17.877 --> 00:19:20.983
But if you can't be there
to hold each other close,

00:19:21.083 --> 00:19:22.386
what's the point?

00:19:25.392 --> 00:19:27.831
I could feel his loneliness
deep inside me

00:19:27.931 --> 00:19:32.439
as I lay there in bed without
him, night after night.

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:35.345
I felt it deeper than
anyone else ever could.

00:19:44.063 --> 00:19:45.633
Merry Christmas.

00:19:45.733 --> 00:19:47.604
We are Blast.

00:19:47.704 --> 00:19:49.674
I still miss those times.

00:19:51.444 --> 00:19:52.747
Ever since he left,

00:19:52.847 --> 00:19:55.987
it feels like I've been
wandering around in a dream,

00:20:00.028 --> 00:20:02.834
especially on a snowy night
like this.

00:20:06.207 --> 00:20:09.280
(train honking)

00:20:14.256 --> 00:20:15.960
When it's cold outside,

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:16.595
I can't help but pray

00:20:16.695 --> 00:20:19.366
that someone is there to
keep him warm.

00:20:44.016 --> 00:20:45.553
Not sweet.

00:20:47.824 --> 00:20:51.330
It's been a year and nine
months since Ren left,

00:20:51.965 --> 00:20:53.636
almost two springs now.

00:20:55.338 --> 00:20:56.575
For my 20th birthday in March

00:20:56.675 --> 00:20:58.979
I'm gonna buy myself a present
as a reward

00:20:59.079 --> 00:21:00.550
for getting through it,

00:21:01.852 --> 00:21:05.225
a one way ticket to Tokyo.

00:21:05.325 --> 00:21:06.662
I won't need anything
but my guitar

00:21:06.762 --> 00:21:08.599
and a pack of cigarettes.
